[00:00] can store your financial energy in a
[00:03] savings device where you don't get
[00:05] inflated away, where you don't get
[00:07] censored, where your money is not
[00:09] getting stolen. We don't even know how
[00:12] much civilization and the human
[00:15] civilization will change just because we
[00:18] have a better money and money is so
[00:20] fundamental. What it produces is
[00:23] security. security from theft because
[00:25] the network is large and decentralized
[00:28] and global and it protects the time and
[00:31] energy you're putting into that network
[00:33] that nobody can steal from. Storing
[00:35] value is the use case like having a
[00:38] place where you can store your financial
[00:40] energy when nobody can manipulate it
[00:43] where nobody can do anything with that
[00:46] and it's yours you have the key to that
[00:49] uh place that bothers me a lot when
[00:51] people are just like oh I I don't want
[00:52] to look into Bitcoin I don't want to
[00:54] make a decision you you made a decision
[00:59] [Music]
[01:02] this episode is an episode where I was
[01:05] invited on Stacy's podcast. Stacy has a
[01:08] unique ability to get an a different
[01:12] feel for for the guests and I really did
[01:14] enjoy that episode a lot and the
[01:16] conversation with her. So I had decided
[01:18] to also post this here because we talked
[01:21] about something very important. We
[01:22] talked about how Bitcoin can transform a
[01:26] life and what implication Bitcoin has on
[01:29] our lives. We talked about not only my
[01:32] story and not only how this transformed
[01:35] my personal story, but also what does it
[01:37] mean if you all of the sudden have
[01:39] Bitcoin and this gives you a chance and
[01:41] this gives you hope in in in life. So,
[01:44] it was a it it was an episode that went
[01:47] really close to my heart and so I wanted
[01:50] to share it uh with with all of you uh
[01:53] and and show you the the potential that
[01:55] Bitcoin really has. Enjoy. How are you
[01:58] Robin?
[02:00] I'm doing good. Thank you so much. Yes.
[02:04] For inviting me a few. Yeah. Thank you
[02:06] so much for joining me. So much has
[02:09] changed since I've been on your show
[02:11] last time.
[02:13] Um I it was on February 11th that I was
[02:16] on your show. So, uh it feels like just
[02:18] yesterday, but I couldn't wait to speak
[02:20] to you again and we just had such a
[02:23] great conversation. And so I just like
[02:25] wanted to get you uh get to know you
[02:27] more and you know learn about your
[02:30] journey this time and find out a little
[02:33] more about how you know your you know
[02:37] just growing up how that shaped you and
[02:39] how you got into this like how you found
[02:40] out about Bitcoin and uh you're doing
[02:42] just so many amazing things right now.
[02:44] You're doing so many podcasts you're
[02:47] spreading the word. you're sharing so
[02:49] many perspectives and you've spoken to
[02:53] some really big uh influential people in
[02:56] the space and that's super inspiring.
[02:58] Also, you just you're going to be
[03:02] speaking at the Bitcoin conference in
[03:04] Vegas, but you've done other uh you know
[03:07] conferences. You've done Prague. Uh I
[03:09] don't know what else you've done, but I
[03:10] want to get into that, too. So today I
[03:14] want to uh start off with growing up in
[03:18] Austria. How uh how it was growing up.
[03:21] How like tell us a little bit about
[03:22] yourself. Um how it was living out there
[03:24] and stuff cuz I'm in America. So I I
[03:27] cannot compare it to America
[03:28] unfortunately. I would love to but
[03:30] because I never grown up myself in
[03:33] America. Uh maybe it would be
[03:36] interesting to to really like compare
[03:37] how how it is in America and what kind
[03:40] of um mindsets you get. I hear there's
[03:42] like the lemonade stand and the selling
[03:45] is actually something that gets teached
[03:47] or taught a lot more in in America and
[03:50] this mindset barriers in in Austria. Um
[03:54] I grew up as a savings kid actually like
[03:57] I learned to save a lot um growing up.
[04:00] It's not normal in Austria. Uh so so
[04:03] it's it's just just to me. But overall I
[04:06] had a very good childhood. Like I had an
[04:08] amazing childhood where I grew up on a
[04:10] farm. I grew up on on very nice uh
[04:13] terms. I didn't play a lot of video
[04:15] games. I played a lot outside. I touched
[04:17] a lot of grass. That that meme it
[04:19] definitely was me. Uh so I had an
[04:22] amazing childhood and uh I I
[04:24] unfortunately don't have a great
[04:27] childhood story where I had like some
[04:29] trauma that I overcame or something like
[04:30] that. I can I cannot say I cannot say
[04:34] that my my parents brought me up very
[04:36] nicely in a in a protected environment.
[04:39] Not too rich, not too poor, somewhere in
[04:41] the
[04:42] middle. Quite normal and quite boring
[04:45] actually. Well, that's actually really
[04:47] nice because that shows you that growing
[04:49] up on a farm and being feeling like
[04:52] you're in the middle and not feeling
[04:53] like you're suffering the hardships of
[04:55] not having enough and having too much
[04:57] can spoil you. So, it keeps you grounded
[05:00] the way you grow up and being in a
[05:02] smaller community and uh you know being
[05:04] able to be creative and be outside and
[05:07] play instead of um you know feeling like
[05:10] you're in a big city that that would be
[05:12] a totally different upbringing. Did you
[05:14] uh do you have any siblings?
[05:16] Uh yes, I have one sister. She she's
[05:20] awesome. She's two years younger than
[05:21] me, so she's my little
[05:23] sister. Yeah, it was it was really
[05:25] great.
[05:27] Austria is like whole of Europe has one
[05:31] big advantage and one big disadvantage.
[05:33] The advantage is it's so
[05:36] beautiful. I travel a lot around the
[05:39] world. You said like uh with the
[05:41] conferences I was in Miami. I will be
[05:42] soon in Vegas. I was in Abu Dhabi. Uh I
[05:47] was in in in Prague. I was in uh El
[05:50] Salvador. And the more I travel around,
[05:52] the more I realized how beautiful
[05:54] Austria, how beautiful Europe is, how
[05:57] rich the culture is. But then the big
[05:59] disadvantages is we have high taxes. or
[06:02] politicians don't get I just talked
[06:05] today actually with another German
[06:08] podcaster who said there's the like
[06:11] there's grassroots movement and there is
[06:14] how how big how big is the adoption for
[06:17] on the political level and the
[06:19] difference between grassroots movement
[06:21] and the political level is nowhere as
[06:25] big as in Austria in Austria we have all
[06:28] the grassroots movement um as no Austria
[06:32] Germany actually Germany we have so many
[06:34] full node operators we have so many
[06:36] people that actually run their own nodes
[06:38] the the mining things we have so many
[06:41] great things going on like the meetup
[06:43] space in Germany is also really really
[06:45] great but the politicians don't get it
[06:47] so that the difference between
[06:50] grassroots movement and what the
[06:51] political level thinks of Bitcoin is
[06:54] very big in in in Europe and in Germany
[06:56] in particular and I think in America
[06:59] actually now the political level is more
[07:01] and or waking up to uh Bitcoin, but also
[07:04] the grassroots movement is really good.
[07:06] So like there's not a huge difference.
[07:08] There's a difference, but not a huge
[07:09] difference. So growing up, obviously as
[07:12] a kid, you love it. Like there's a lot
[07:14] of playgrounds, there are rivers. I was
[07:17] every day in a forest and I
[07:19] I had all all sicknesses uh combined
[07:23] with with a forest because I was every
[07:26] every day there. uh we we make like
[07:29] wooden houses, we make things in in the
[07:31] forest. It's an it's a really I I had
[07:34] that typical uh childhood, but then also
[07:38] you get a disadvantages with with that
[07:40] unfortunately. So it would be awesome if
[07:42] Austria had low taxes, low bureaucracy,
[07:45] but uh and high bitcoin adoption, but it
[07:48] is lighter is unfortunately not like
[07:50] that. Yeah, the bureaucracy kind of you
[07:52] see that all over and the we all wish
[07:54] there was higher bitcoin adoption. I can
[07:56] relate to the uh forest as a kid. I used
[08:00] to I grew up in a suburb and I used to
[08:02] climb trees all the time and you know
[08:04] pretend that we were looking out for you
[08:06] know bad guys and just kind of
[08:08] pretending a lot and I I loved climbing
[08:09] trees so I can I I relate to that uh
[08:12] sort of a childhood. It was a quiet
[08:14] neighborhood but we definitely had a lot
[08:15] of nature around us. Um so were your
[08:18] parents farmers? Uh but my grandparents
[08:21] were and but my parents uh um basically
[08:25] my my mom is had a lot of jobs in in her
[08:28] life. Currently she's she's working um
[08:32] not as a nurse but like something
[08:34] similar. I I don't know the English word
[08:36] actually for that but she's helping
[08:38] doctors. Um so my dad founded companies
[08:41] and worked in sales and did some
[08:44] management jobs. So he he's been around
[08:46] in in in a lot of different ways. So
[08:48] it's it's quite the the middle ground of
[08:51] of how people can can live up. Not not
[08:54] very rich, not very poor, somewhere in
[08:56] the middle as I said. Uh and this this
[08:59] how I grew up. But I said I grew up on a
[09:02] farm because my granddad uh actually
[09:05] lived just uh like 500 m from us, like
[09:09] really close. And there was a big farm
[09:12] with cows, with horses, with with uh
[09:15] bigs, with everything you you want to
[09:17] wish in in a farm with tractors. It it's
[09:20] it's just a such a beautiful playground
[09:23] for kids because you can literally run
[09:25] around. You can uh play hide and seek
[09:28] with with other kids. H And the cool
[09:30] thing is also um you can actually
[09:34] experience
[09:36] uh life on a different way. I I got to
[09:39] um do the farming work with my granddad
[09:44] every single day. I was coming home
[09:46] quickly, do my homework and just running
[09:48] to my granddad and just doing the the
[09:51] farming work. So that was really that
[09:54] was really important uh for me in the
[09:55] childhood. Yeah, it's like you get to
[09:57] spend time with him and you could talk
[09:59] to him and he could, you know, tell you
[10:01] stories and you could also uh kids love
[10:03] helping, you know, so it's really fun
[10:05] for kids to help instead of a lot of
[10:07] people nowadays think, uh, oh, don't ask
[10:09] the kids to help out with with chores or
[10:11] things you need to get done cuz, you
[10:12] know, they don't want to do it, so they
[10:14] just kind of baby them. But I think kids
[10:15] do enjoy helping, uh, you know, so it's
[10:17] always nice to it's nice that you had
[10:20] that. Um, do you live in the city now or
[10:22] where do you live now? Now I live
[10:24] actually in the city. Uh, so now I'm
[10:26] from my work I can basically live
[10:28] wherever I want to live. Um, but my
[10:31] girlfriend is is working in the city. So
[10:34] I live wherever my girlfriend is living
[10:36] currently. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
[10:38] You don't want to have to drive uh an
[10:39] hour to go see
[10:41] her. So when you um I want to find out
[10:44] about how you went to Abu Dhabi and all
[10:46] those places. Were those a lot Bitcoin
[10:48] related trips? Absolutely. Absolutely.
[10:50] Yeah. Like those places that I counted
[10:52] was all Bitcoin conferences. I've been
[10:54] to many more places because my parents
[10:56] always uh brought us to to holidays
[10:59] actually almost every every um almost
[11:03] every year. But those things that I
[11:06] counted so El Salvador, Abu Dhabi, Miami
[11:10] um uh Vegas soon Prague, these are all
[11:12] places I went because of Bitcoin
[11:14] conferences. Um, so th this was uh this
[11:18] was really cool to this is really cool
[11:20] to see the world and go to the Bitcoin
[11:23] conferences and then extend the stay a
[11:26] little bit longer and see the city, see
[11:28] the
[11:29] environment. I also encourage every
[11:31] American uh if they want to see Europe
[11:34] like just come to Bitcoin Prague. You've
[11:36] seen amazing Bitcoiners there and then
[11:38] you extend your stay for like 5 days and
[11:41] you can roam around whole of Europe.
[11:44] Like Europe is very small. You can be in
[11:46] Austria, Germany, Czech, all all those
[11:49] France, all those great places. Take a
[11:51] train, you know, right? Train and drive.
[11:54] Like it's so easy in in Europe. So I I I
[11:58] like to do that. Uh come to earlier or
[12:00] stay a little bit longer in Bitcoin
[12:02] conferences and see see the nature, see
[12:04] see a little bit of the what's going on
[12:05] outside of Bitcoin in that city. Yeah,
[12:08] you might as well if you're there,
[12:09] right? You're not going to just go for
[12:10] your 3-day conference and just jump out,
[12:12] you know, at least at least enjoy your
[12:14] trip and make it a make it a fun time
[12:16] and explore. Um, so can you tell us
[12:19] something about yourself that is uh
[12:21] surprising? Something that you like as a
[12:22] hobby or something people don't really
[12:24] know about you. Oh man, surprising.
[12:28] What kind of interest? Even if you're
[12:29] interested in something other than
[12:30] Bitcoin. So So one thing that is
[12:32] surprising about myself is how how tall
[12:35] I am. Uh people that that's literally
[12:37] the first thing that people tell me when
[12:39] they meet me in person for the first
[12:41] time because most people just see me
[12:42] from the screen. Uh I'm almost 2 m. Uh
[12:46] that's that's like I don't know 6' 7.
[12:49] Wow. Yeah. Six I don't know like I don't
[12:52] know the exact one but 2 m um it is. So
[12:56] I'm I'm really tall and people are oh
[12:58] like like on my on my phone you're
[13:00] so small. Oh that's so funny. Yeah I
[13:03] wouldn't have thought that tall. I mean,
[13:04] you look tall, but I I just wouldn't
[13:06] have pictured 66 or 67. Yeah, I have to
[13:09] put like some disclaimer, I think, on my
[13:12] podcast. Really tall guy. Really
[13:15] actually really tall guy. Uh I'm I'm
[13:18] really I like sports a lot. Uh I'm I'm
[13:20] uh I swam actually like I'm I was
[13:23] swimming in the u on a national level in
[13:26] Austria like on a really good level
[13:28] actually but for Austria not like not
[13:31] the American national level like the the
[13:34] no Austrian swimmer could compete with
[13:36] any of the American swimmers because
[13:38] they're really good. That's just saying
[13:40] that you're better than the swimmers in
[13:41] your country. So that's that's amazing.
[13:43] Oh yeah. I I was in in some disciplines
[13:46] in like the top 10, top 20 in in in my
[13:49] in in my country. Cool. That that was
[13:52] really really uh cool. This is like one
[13:55] interest. But it's actually it's getting
[13:57] hard and harder to come up with
[13:58] interests outside of Bitcoin because my
[14:00] life is just so evolved around Bitcoin.
[14:03] It's also funny because on my podcast I
[14:05] asked this question, okay, what can we
[14:07] learn from you besides Bitcoin? And I
[14:09] asked every single guest and um most of
[14:12] the guests are like wait okay besides
[14:16] Bitcoin like what what is there besides
[14:18] Bitcoin and it's it's clearly because
[14:21] Bitcoin is such a a major fork in the
[14:23] road of humanity obviously we want to
[14:25] spend all our time and energy there but
[14:28] I think it's important to also find
[14:30] interests outside of Bitcoin. I think
[14:33] the biggest interest I currently have
[14:36] outside of Bitcoin is chess.
[14:39] I I love chess. I'm not the best in it.
[14:42] Um but I do love it a lot. Uh it's uh
[14:45] tactical. I can play it uh on my phone.
[14:48] I can play it wherever I am. Um I can
[14:51] play it offline. I can play it with with
[14:53] other friends. in El Salvador on the
[14:56] conference there was actually a section
[14:58] with chess boards and I loved it so much
[15:00] because I was just there and could play
[15:03] chess with Bitcoin as it was literally
[15:05] my two worlds colliding. It's actually
[15:08] something uh someone asked me, "Oh, if
[15:10] if you don't want to talk about Bitcoin
[15:12] and you're retired, what would you talk
[15:14] about?" I would probably make up an
[15:17] chess account on YouTube and just play
[15:20] chess on a live stream every day and
[15:22] just talk. That's amazing. Yeah, I love
[15:25] to thank you for sharing that. And also,
[15:27] it reminds me of a time where I I don't
[15:30] watch a ton of TV, but me and my husband
[15:31] like to watch some shows together and we
[15:33] watched The Queen's Gambit. I don't know
[15:35] if you've ever seen that, but it is a
[15:37] show about chess and it is incredible.
[15:39] It made me I was obsessed with chess for
[15:42] a while. Just she was such a great
[15:43] actress and it's such a great show. So,
[15:46] if you love chess, you might want to
[15:47] watch that. But it's not too long of a I
[15:50] I saw that on on Netflix.
[15:53] I'm always trying to stay away from
[15:55] shows that are really popular.
[15:57] So, so you're saying it's a nice show.
[16:00] Amazing. Yeah, I would definitely watch
[16:01] that when you have some downtime. And
[16:03] And since you love chess, it's it's
[16:04] great. I don't even I didn't even know
[16:06] much about chess and I loved it. Like I
[16:08] started to get uh an app on my phone
[16:10] that I was trying to play chess cuz I've
[16:12] never actually played before. Um but now
[16:14] talking about it makes me want to get
[16:16] into chess a little more too. So that
[16:17] would be uh that would be fun. But I
[16:19] would recommend it. If you're in chess,
[16:21] let me know. Uh, we can we can play an
[16:23] online game. I would love to like I love
[16:25] to I would love to challenge you. That's
[16:27] awesome. Yeah, I have to learn uh a
[16:29] little more. I mean, I I know a little
[16:30] bit of the rules, but I have to get a
[16:32] little more familiar, but that would
[16:33] definitely be fun. Let's Let's do a a
[16:35] second round on your podcast in one
[16:37] year, and then let's do like an oneh
[16:40] hour chess game where we talk about
[16:42] Bitcoin and play chess next to it. Yes,
[16:45] that would be so cool. I would love
[16:46] that. Yeah, because you could just be
[16:48] because I used to do that, too. I used
[16:49] to play uh more like video games. I was
[16:52] kind of a gamer, I guess, in 2020. Um,
[16:55] and that was something me and my husband
[16:56] found to do together uh when we couldn't
[16:58] go a lot of places, but we just the
[17:00] reason we loved playing also was we
[17:02] would play with other friends and you
[17:04] you'd be just chatting about whatever's
[17:06] going on. I would talk about Bitcoin
[17:07] with everybody, you know, I would just
[17:09] kind of tell them what I'm learning as
[17:11] we're playing this video game. So, I I
[17:12] love that idea. I think that's so fun.
[17:15] Absolutely. I'm I'm I'm down for it.
[17:17] Yeah. Um, so when you felt like I want
[17:21] to know how you got into, you know,
[17:24] Bitcoin like specifically, but and then
[17:26] I want to know how you got into what
[17:29] made you decide to start a podcast and
[17:32] uh you but first what was your journey
[17:34] into Bitcoin like? So I I I already told
[17:38] you like I was always a very saving
[17:40] person. So when I got into Bitcoin, I I
[17:45] like most people go in Bitcoin and they
[17:47] learn something from that and most
[17:49] people learn savings and I I already had
[17:52] that. I remember what uh being in the
[17:54] supermarket as a small kid in the in
[17:57] like the preschool days and uh there's
[18:00] like one day I remember nicely. I was
[18:03] there and whenever my mom gave me like€5
[18:06] to spend on my lunch money, I put €2
[18:09] away and saved it and only spent three
[18:12] because I know at home I have a full
[18:15] fridge. Like why would I need to buy a
[18:17] lot of things in my lunchtime when I
[18:20] have a full fridge at home? So what I
[18:23] would do is spend only €3 on a small
[18:26] thing so I can eat a little bit and then
[18:29] with the rest of the with the remaining
[18:31] of the 5 years with the two years I just
[18:33] save and save it up for for no reason at
[18:36] all. I just save it. So it was always in
[18:38] back of my mind I want to save money. I
[18:40] want to save my financial energy. I
[18:42] didn't knew why I was doing that back
[18:44] then obviously but it was just an
[18:45] intuition that I that I had. And one day
[18:48] I remember I was at the checkout of of
[18:51] the supertore of the supermarket and my
[18:55] mom was by accident at the same
[18:58] supermarket because she was buying
[18:59] groceries for us and she saw me that the
[19:02] the kids got all the things like really
[19:04] a lot of things and I just bought like
[19:05] that one small bread and she was feeling
[19:08] sorry for for me and I was like oh why
[19:10] are you not using your money and she was
[19:12] like buying something for me. Uh so uh I
[19:16] just tell that because my my mom really
[19:19] wanted to spoil me in that regard but I
[19:22] still wanted to save. It was so deep in
[19:24] me that I wanted to save. It probably
[19:26] comes from my dad. Um but it it is
[19:28] something that it was always in me. Uh
[19:31] with that and that's uh maybe important
[19:34] for now. Um with 18 years old I first
[19:38] was able to invest in the stock market.
[19:40] So in Austria, I don't know how it is in
[19:42] in America actually, but in Austria, you
[19:44] can only invest in the stock market when
[19:46] you're 18 years old or older. Before
[19:49] that, uh you can only invest with the
[19:52] parents permission and with like a a
[19:54] child account and stuff stuff like that.
[19:55] I never wanted to do that. So it was the
[19:58] first time where I could invest
[19:59] something. And what did I
[20:01] choose? I I invested in a savings
[20:04] account of my bank. It was literally the
[20:07] worst decision ever. But I did that for
[20:10] I don't know a few months and I
[20:11] accumulated like 4 cents in interest
[20:14] payments and I said that's nothing. So I
[20:19] rather just don't do it at all. I was
[20:21] like doing the calculations whatever do
[20:22] it for 20 years and nothing happens.
[20:26] And then I went to the next one, ETFs
[20:28] and and all the uh instruments. I had it
[20:31] always like for half a year for a year
[20:33] and I always was like there's not a lot
[20:36] showing up like I I want to do something
[20:38] with that money. So I eventually came
[20:41] into the stock market game. I I was a
[20:43] complete stock pro. For the first two
[20:45] years I didn't want to make any money
[20:46] because I had to learn how to pick
[20:48] stocks. It's a it's a skill how to how
[20:51] to see the Q the the 10 Q's the 10 Ks
[20:55] and and see okay what is a good
[20:57] management team uh what is a good cash
[20:59] flow like what are the a good PE ratios
[21:02] and stuff like that how to pick a nice
[21:04] stock I had to learn those things and it
[21:08] took me about 2 years from like 18 to
[21:10] like 20 years old to really learn that
[21:13] and then I had uh one one and a half two
[21:16] years where it went really great
[21:19] actually and more and more people
[21:21] because it went great asked me hey what
[21:23] do you think about that that Bitcoin
[21:25] thing and I said from the beginning uh I
[21:29] did the stock market thing till the till
[21:31] I met Bitcoin from 2017 to 2020 it was
[21:35] Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme it's a scam
[21:39] it has no cash flow it has no value like
[21:41] why should I buy it so in 2020 I finally
[21:45] decided hey more and more people kept
[21:48] asking to me about Bitcoin. I want to
[21:51] really prove them wrong why Bitcoin is
[21:53] bad and I want to find more arguments
[21:56] against Bitcoin or I basically set out
[21:59] for a mission for uh one
[22:02] weekend. This is the weekend where I try
[22:06] to find arguments against Bitcoin and
[22:08] this was the weekend where I find found
[22:10] arguments for Bitcoin. So this weekend
[22:13] basically orange pa me. So on Monday I
[22:16] got into a Coinbase account. On Tuesday,
[22:18] I got my first ledger and from there it
[22:20] was just a matter of time till I went
[22:22] all in. It was like 2020 where I was
[22:25] orange build and 2021 where I basically
[22:28] was 100% into Bitcoin. Wow. So yeah,
[22:31] that's the crazy part about when you try
[22:33] when people tell you to invest in
[22:36] Bitcoin or to buy Bitcoin and by trying
[22:39] to tell people why you shouldn't do it
[22:42] is how you end up deciding that it's
[22:44] it's the right thing to do. It's it's
[22:46] crazy how that
[22:48] works. So I think that that's how my my
[22:53] journey was in 2020 also. That's that's
[22:55] when I got started and I feel the same
[22:58] way like I thought it was interesting
[22:59] but I I had you have to do the research
[23:01] you know you have to try to disprove it.
[23:03] You do want to try to you are skeptical
[23:05] about it but the more you learn about it
[23:07] the more you realize that all the
[23:08] thoughts you had about it are um not
[23:11] what you thought. So, one of the biggest
[23:13] push backs I get from people, and I I I
[23:16] remember us talking on your show about
[23:17] how we don't try to argue with people,
[23:20] we just like to let them speak and see
[23:23] why they uh don't think it's a good
[23:26] thing. And we just find that gap in
[23:28] knowledge because then they eventually
[23:30] realize or you eventually realize that
[23:33] the arguments they're making, there's
[23:35] some sort of a lack in in in how much
[23:37] they know about it. So, then uh you
[23:39] could ask, "Well, why do you think
[23:40] that?" and then they start to, you know,
[23:42] come around. But the biggest push back I
[23:45] get from when I ask like some stubborn
[23:48] people or because they know that I
[23:50] understand Bitcoin, they they love to
[23:52] just bring up that it's not backed by
[23:54] anything or what does it produce?
[23:57] Because most uh you know resources in
[23:59] the world, they produce a material
[24:01] that's valuable and they just don't
[24:02] understand that. I the way I try to
[24:05] explain I don't know if you have a
[24:06] different way to explain it to people
[24:07] who say those things but what it
[24:10] produces is security security from theft
[24:14] because the network is large and
[24:16] decentralized and global and it protects
[24:19] the time and energy you're putting into
[24:21] that network that nobody can steal from.
[24:23] So I'm I call it a big shield. I'm like
[24:26] that's what it produces. It produces the
[24:27] biggest defense against theft. Um, but I
[24:30] don't know if you have another way that
[24:32] you put it or people do you encounter
[24:33] people that say that or something else?
[24:36] It's it's such a it's such a a lazy
[24:39] thing to say. Uh, saying like, "Oh, uh,
[24:42] Bitcoin doesn't produce anything." Yeah.
[24:45] Like what what does gold produce? And
[24:47] then people are like, "Oh yeah, gold is
[24:50] used in metals and in smartphones."
[24:52] Yeah. How much is this? Like 5% of the
[24:56] value of gold. Thi think about how much
[24:58] more aluminium is used in all sorts of
[25:03] things and uh why is aluminium so much
[25:07] less worth than gold? Because gold is
[25:09] used as a store of value. Storing value
[25:12] is the use case. Like having a place
[25:15] where you can store your financial
[25:17] energy when nobody can manipulate it,
[25:20] where nobody can do anything with that
[25:23] and it's yours. you have the key to that
[25:26] uh place. That's the use case. And then
[25:28] we have the the the lowerase B and the
[25:32] uppercase B of like the the Bitcoin as a
[25:34] store of value and the Bitcoin as the
[25:36] network. So the network also has some
[25:39] value to it. But obviously it's the
[25:42] biggest value is that you can store your
[25:44] financial energy in a savings device
[25:48] where you don't get inflated away, where
[25:50] you don't get um censored, where your
[25:53] money is not getting stolen, where yeah,
[25:56] all those arguments. So people don't say
[26:00] that's a use case. They the fact that
[26:03] Bitcoin is not used for anything else
[26:06] than just money makes it the perfect
[26:08] money. We don't want money to be used in
[26:11] smartphones. We don't want money to be
[26:14] jewelry also because jewelry should be
[26:17] jewelry and uh things that go in
[26:20] smartphones materials should be in
[26:22] smartphones. Money should just be money
[26:25] at the end of the day. And people that
[26:28] actively, and that's a really good
[26:30] point, people that that actively take
[26:32] the decision do not buy Bitcoin betting
[26:36] against Bitcoin. So if you have 0%
[26:38] Bitcoin allocation, you're basically
[26:40] saying Bitcoin is going to zero and it
[26:43] will uh fade out. Then you better have a
[26:46] good reason for that. You if if you're
[26:49] betting against Bitcoin and you think
[26:52] Bitcoin will go to zero, you should
[26:55] better have a really good thesis because
[26:58] the last 16 years you have been dead
[27:01] wrong.
[27:02] 100%. That is such a good point. I mean,
[27:06] if it's not going to zero, it's going to
[27:09] continue going up. That's what we say.
[27:10] So, they have been dead wrong. So,
[27:12] that's that's a really great point. I
[27:14] love it. And and also, one thing, um, a
[27:17] lot of people don't realize that this
[27:20] decision is an active decision. They
[27:21] they just make the decision of not
[27:24] making a decision. So, they're just in
[27:27] they're just doing their uh savings in
[27:30] euros and in US dollars. Then they might
[27:33] have a small stock portfolio. Maybe they
[27:35] have some ETFs or maybe they or maybe
[27:38] they own their own home and they see the
[27:40] home as an investing. These all are
[27:42] decisions. We we are not if you don't go
[27:46] into Bitcoin that's a active decision
[27:48] against Bitcoin. People think if you
[27:51] don't go in Bitcoin, I just did not make
[27:54] the decision. So I don't have to uh
[27:56] think about it and I don't have to
[27:58] research Bitcoin. But you do have to
[28:00] research Bitcoin because if you're not
[28:02] into Bitcoin, you're betting against it.
[28:05] If if if you listen to any Bitcoiner and
[28:08] you think, oh, like he's talking that
[28:12] Bitcoin is completely revolutionizing
[28:14] the whole financial
[28:16] space, then then this is a pretty huge
[28:20] thing. So I should spend some time to
[28:23] think about is this actually going to
[28:26] happening or not. So if you spend some
[28:28] time on that and you're educating
[28:29] yourself, you will come to to the uh um
[28:32] to the realization, oh yeah, that's
[28:35] actually happening. Um uh this is
[28:37] actually possible. And if you think that
[28:40] there's just a a 3% chance that Bitcoin
[28:45] might actually be the next financial
[28:47] asset that is underlying everything,
[28:51] then allocate 3% of your portfolio to
[28:53] Bitcoin. Nothing wrong with that. It's
[28:55] it's it shows your conviction. I have
[28:57] 100% of my wealth in Bitcoin because I'm
[29:00] 100% certain. That might be foolish uh
[29:04] because there might be a black swan uh
[29:06] event. I don't think so. But uh that's
[29:10] my belief. That's my conviction. And you
[29:12] if you have uh 3% uh chance that Bitcoin
[29:16] might be the thing, then you put 3% in
[29:20] Bitcoin and seven and 97% of your money
[29:23] in whatever other system you believe in.
[29:25] If you think the digital euro uh will
[29:28] rule the world, then put 97% in the
[29:31] digital euro and 3% in Bitcoin. I think
[29:35] I will have a better financial uh future
[29:37] with my Bitcoin bet uh against your
[29:40] digital euro bet.
[29:41] But it's fine. But people have to
[29:44] realize they make an active decision.
[29:46] They're not like that. That bothers me a
[29:48] lot when people are just like, "Oh, I
[29:50] don't want to look into Bitcoin. I don't
[29:52] want to make a decision." You you made a
[29:54] decision. Yeah. You made a decision by
[29:56] ignoring it, you know? So your decision
[29:58] is once you've hear about Bitcoin and it
[30:01] crosses your mind and you've heard
[30:02] anybody talk about it whether it be on a
[30:04] podcast or just in real life just
[30:06] hearing it hearing it mentioned the fact
[30:08] that you even know that such a thing as
[30:10] Bitcoin exists once you find that out
[30:13] you make the active decision to not care
[30:15] or not be interested or not learn about
[30:17] it. So, you're right. It's like if you
[30:20] don't think this thing is true, then
[30:21] figure out why you think that. You know,
[30:23] try to try to understand that uh why you
[30:26] don't believe every like why you think
[30:27] everybody else is wrong that you hear
[30:29] talking about it. Um it's it's
[30:31] definitely something worth your time to
[30:33] try to understand like why are people um
[30:36] why do people think this is, you know,
[30:39] the the future? Um, and that's what
[30:41] bothers me about people who believe in
[30:42] gold so much and promote gold so much
[30:44] because you're supposed to be the type
[30:46] of people in this world that educate
[30:48] people on finances and
[30:50] you don't take the time yourself to
[30:53] realize that your own arguments are
[30:55] false. So, I think that that is just
[30:59] laziness. Hate to say it like that. I
[31:02] feel bad if I just tell but it is lazy.
[31:04] It's lazy because you're not taking the
[31:06] time to to either understand it or to
[31:08] prove it wrong. you know, try to prove
[31:10] it wrong. And that's usually why we're
[31:12] here to to uh you know, see where, you
[31:16] know, help them through it if they if
[31:17] they have questions. You know, we're
[31:19] here to be supportive and to and to help
[31:21] people understand. Um but just yeah, I
[31:23] think uh when people argue just so much
[31:25] against it, it's just like you obviously
[31:26] it shows that they obviously haven't
[31:28] taken the time. So it it's 100% and and
[31:32] it's it's
[31:34] something there are there are certain
[31:37] innovations in in the human history that
[31:41] changed civilization forever and I call
[31:45] them the the fork in the road uh
[31:48] invention. I don't have a better name
[31:49] for that right now. Bitcoiners really um
[31:52] encouraged me to look at history and
[31:55] this is what I basically right now do um
[31:58] when I don't have a podcast and when I
[32:00] don't I don't research Bitcoin now and
[32:04] now research history. So I've looked
[32:06] into the printing press, the steam
[32:08] engine,
[32:09] electricity, the electronic telegraph
[32:13] with communicating uh all those
[32:15] innovations in the past that have been
[32:18] made from Samuel Moors, from James Vat,
[32:22] from all those
[32:24] innovators that changed how we think
[32:27] about the world, that changed how we
[32:29] interacted with the world. And we we can
[32:32] now really dive deep into the different
[32:34] invention but probably would be a very
[32:36] long one. But let's let's say like the
[32:38] the printing press before the
[32:42] information was controlled by churches.
[32:45] The information was controlled by a
[32:47] small elite group of people that had the
[32:50] the the manpower to actually write the
[32:53] the books. One book took a few months or
[32:57] sometimes a year depending on how big
[32:59] the book is to make. When Johannes
[33:02] Gutenberg came uh and invented the the
[33:05] printing press with the movable uh metal
[33:08] type with the oil based ink and and with
[33:10] those with the the wine uh uh wine
[33:14] presses with the screw press he
[33:16] basically made it possible for everyone
[33:18] to print um books. So if you look before
[33:22] Johannes Gutenberg, we have one book in
[33:26] like few months uh or like sometimes
[33:29] even a over a year. Then Johannes
[33:31] Gutenberg came in and in his first 5
[33:33] years of the invention he managed to
[33:36] print 180 books. It's a lot more because
[33:40] he's he was just one person. But then
[33:43] look out for 50 years later. So in the
[33:46] first 5 years he managed to print 180
[33:49] books. Then in the next 45 years there
[33:53] were another 50 million books and this
[33:56] was just Europe.
[33:59] So imagining what happens if the right
[34:02] innovation comes into the conversation
[34:07] we we don't even know how much
[34:10] civilization and and the human
[34:13] civilization will change just because we
[34:16] have a better money and money is so
[34:19] fundamental. Uh the this book thing was
[34:22] very fundamental because it unlocked
[34:24] information. Now all of a sudden uh you
[34:27] can and there we can go really deep but
[34:31] there's like uh with Martin Luther King
[34:33] uh who Martin Luther who has used it uh
[34:36] and and many others who use that
[34:38] technology like toh to spread messages
[34:40] and stuff like that. Uh there was so
[34:42] many bookshops like it was all of all of
[34:44] the sudden affordable for for people to
[34:47] to to produce books. There was all of
[34:50] the sudden people started learning to
[34:53] read. Before that, not a lot of people
[34:55] could read because there are not that
[34:58] many books books around. Why should you
[34:59] read? So there's all those things coming
[35:02] from an innovation that we don't even
[35:04] know about. So if you just give that a 5
[35:08] 10% chance of Bitcoin being one of them,
[35:12] don't you think it's fair to like read
[35:16] one book about
[35:18] it? Why not give it a chance? Yeah.
[35:20] coming from somebody who as a child, you
[35:23] know, you saved two out of your three,
[35:26] you know, I don't want to say dollars,
[35:27] what what currency was it? Euros, but
[35:30] yeah, it's it's always the same. Okay.
[35:32] You saved two out of your three euros as
[35:34] a child, you know, you were into saving
[35:35] as a kid. You you always had that habit.
[35:38] You always wanted to save money. So,
[35:40] coming from somebody like that, you're
[35:42] not somebody who, as a kid, you spent
[35:45] all your money. You always wanted more.
[35:47] You're always trying to look to gain
[35:48] more. You're you're you're not the type
[35:50] who gamles. You're the type who saves.
[35:52] So your personality, the type of person
[35:55] you are, you're not gambling when you
[35:57] get Bitcoin. You're gambling when you
[35:59] don't get Bitcoin. So you are actually
[36:02] doing the right thing because you took
[36:04] the time to find the best way to save
[36:06] your money because you as a kid that was
[36:08] your goal and you still have that goal
[36:10] and you uh so it's not coming from
[36:12] somebody who you're thinking is a risky
[36:15] with their money. you know, your their
[36:18] opinion is from someone who as a child
[36:20] and there aren't too many children who
[36:22] think that way, you know, so you've
[36:24] always had this and you're not the the
[36:26] type of person who gambled. So, I think
[36:28] a lot of people um, you know, don't
[36:30] understand that. They think that
[36:31] Bitcoiners are taking that risk, but
[36:33] Bitcoiners are actually seeing that this
[36:35] is the best savings tool.
[36:37] Um, so yeah, that's that's a really good
[36:39] point to, you know, speak on your um
[36:43] behavior always how you've been and and
[36:45] what kind of person they're listening to
[36:46] give them this advice. It's not somebody
[36:49] who is reckless. So when you decided to
[36:53] start your own podcast, what made you
[36:55] decide to do that? How did your family
[36:57] feel? Like do you work uh other than
[37:00] Bitcoin or do you do podcasting
[37:01] full-time now? This
[37:03] was probably the hardest decision I've
[37:06] ever taken in my whole life to do
[37:09] full-time before Bitcoin podcast. So, I
[37:12] doing Bitcoin podcasting full-time since
[37:16] one year and uh two months now. So, one
[37:21] year and two months I'm into Bitcoin
[37:23] podcasting full-time. Before that, I did
[37:28] six years in a company where I like the
[37:31] people. I liked what we did. Um, I moved
[37:34] from being a software tester to being a
[37:37] software engineer to being involved in a
[37:40] managed service to being one of the uh
[37:43] key account managers there to being
[37:46] basically right next to the to the CEO
[37:49] uh and and uh driving around with him uh
[37:52] through the whole country. So I was I
[37:55] had a a rather successful career up
[37:59] until my young age already in the field
[38:03] industry in the IT security
[38:05] industry. But I always had that Bitcoin
[38:08] thing in my mind and I started that side
[38:11] hustle of a Bitcoin podcast and it was
[38:14] so cool and it was so so different and I
[38:18] liked it so much but it didn't pay
[38:21] anything. Yeah. How long were you doing
[38:23] it? How long were you doing it part-time
[38:25] before
[38:26] you went full-time? Let's take a break
[38:29] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[38:32] that Coin Vigilante has made with the
[38:34] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[38:37] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[38:40] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[38:43] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[38:46] completely new and amazing Genesis
[38:48] edition of their watch collections. You
[38:51] have the date of the first ever mined
[38:54] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[38:57] also the block height and which epoch we
[39:00] are currently in. I love the level of
[39:03] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[39:06] Make sure to check out those amazing
[39:08] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[39:11] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[39:14] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[39:17] really do hope that you don't have it on
[39:19] exchange. But if you do have it on
[39:20] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[39:22] deal with that. The first way is you put
[39:25] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[39:27] entry for you to get into the
[39:29] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[39:33] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[39:35] super simple and secure way. And if you
[39:38] check out the link in the description,
[39:40] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[39:43] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[39:46] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[39:49] partner in terms of how to get the most
[39:52] out of your sovereignty. They will
[39:55] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[39:58] that is perfect for your individual
[40:01] situation. They will show you how you
[40:03] can secure your own devices. Securing
[40:06] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[40:08] have to keep all your devices secure.
[40:10] One topic that is overlooked often is
[40:12] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[40:15] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[40:18] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[40:20] place already? And last but not least,
[40:22] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[40:24] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[40:27] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[40:32] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[40:35] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[40:38] be for the first time ever speaking at
[40:40] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[40:43] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[40:46] really looking forward to seeing all of
[40:48] you there. You can get your ticket in
[40:50] the link down in the description of
[40:52] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[40:55] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[40:58] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[41:00] there. Uh I was doing uh it not that
[41:04] long. So I started uh beginning so let's
[41:08] say um 2024 in March was the uh day the
[41:14] 1st of March where I went fulltime into
[41:19] podcasting. In the beginning of 2023 I
[41:22] started with fulltime no part-time doing
[41:25] Twitter. So I grew my Twitter in 203
[41:28] from zero to like let's say 7,000
[41:30] followers in one year. And then at the
[41:34] end of 2093, so like November, I started
[41:37] the podcast. So did the podcast
[41:39] part-time for four months. But the
[41:41] Twitter phase was very important because
[41:43] there I built up the connections. So
[41:46] that's what allowed me to have people
[41:48] like Jeff Bof or like other people uh
[41:51] that are really big uh quite early on
[41:53] the podcast. So uh I I would the podcast
[41:56] I worked on 4 months but the Twitter
[41:59] phase where I put out 5 to 12 tweets per
[42:02] day every single day whole of 2020 I had
[42:06] an average of 55 tweets for all of 20
[42:11] 203 because I put so much uh content out
[42:14] there. I just wanted to make it work. Um
[42:16] so this was the the time where I I made
[42:19] this work next to working full-time or
[42:22] part-time. So I
[42:24] worked as uh some period of the time
[42:27] full-time in my job and then at the end
[42:30] I already just worked part-time. So it
[42:33] allowed me to do more of the podcasting
[42:35] while still paying my bills. And then I
[42:38] made that decision and I was so scared.
[42:42] I don't know. Imagine you're uh like 25
[42:46] years old, you're young, but still you
[42:49] already have like 6 years in a company
[42:52] that you invested so much emotional
[42:54] capital but also so much time and you
[42:58] feel good like there's nothing driving
[43:00] me away from the company. The the boss
[43:02] was really cool, my people, my employees
[43:04] or like not my employees but like my
[43:06] co-workers was really cool. So
[43:08] everything was was fitting nicely. But I
[43:11] had uh a few moments where I realized,
[43:16] oh like I have to do this. Uh and
[43:18] this the two things were basically Jeff
[43:20] Booof and uh how is it called? Jim Jim
[43:24] Carrey uh Jeff Boof basically said after
[43:27] the the podcast to me I realized no he
[43:30] actually said it on the podcast on on
[43:32] the first episode he said uh he told the
[43:36] story how he uh worked still completely
[43:40] in fear but had all his money in
[43:44] Bitcoin. One day he woke up and said
[43:47] like all my time is in fear like what am
[43:50] I doing where then ego defe capital and
[43:52] all those things from like Jeff poof
[43:54] story probably a lot of people are aware
[43:56] and now he's full into bitcoin so he
[43:59] realized that uh he not only wants to be
[44:04] with his money in bitcoin but also with
[44:05] his time and then I I randomly saw a
[44:08] speech of of Jim Kerry where he said one
[44:11] sentence that just stuck with me and he
[44:13] made an amazing speech I only recommend
[44:16] people seeing that speech. I think like
[44:18] Jim Kerry speech um some university he
[44:21] was uh you probably will find it and he
[44:24] said one sentence in there he's like he
[44:26] he told about his dad how his dad was an
[44:29] accountant and uh he uh was always
[44:32] making the conservative safe choice and
[44:36] then one day they let him go and his
[44:39] family struggled and Jim Carrey said I
[44:42] learned from that that if you take the
[44:44] conservative choice if you take the safe
[44:46] choice you can also fail. So because you
[44:50] can fail at something that you don't
[44:52] like, you might as well just take the
[44:54] chance to do something that you like.
[44:58] Something like that. He can say it say
[45:00] it in a better way. So those two things
[45:03] and a lot of other small things kind of
[45:05] made me realize I have to I have to try
[45:09] it. I if I don't try it then then what
[45:12] I'm doing I'm I'm I'm basically
[45:15] if I never if I never take the the the
[45:18] step and never take the chance to really
[45:20] get out then I I really regret that my
[45:23] whole my life because it was what really
[45:25] calling and then the Bitcoin thing came
[45:28] in because I was still I want to I want
[45:32] to pay my I want to I don't want to be
[45:36] dependent on my parents or anything like
[45:37] that. I don't want to fall back to
[45:39] anything like that. I want to pay my own
[45:41] rent. I want to pay for my own food. I
[45:43] want to want to be
[45:44] self-sufficient. And I had a Bitcoin
[45:46] stack that I saved up all my life. Like
[45:49] until 26. I was a very saving
[45:52] personality. All my life, every month I
[45:55] saved more than uh than I put out. So I
[46:00] had a stack where I was like, okay, I
[46:02] could live from that some months. I
[46:05] don't know. uh difficult to to say
[46:09] exactly how how much how many months I
[46:12] could live from that but I could live at
[46:14] least a little bit from that. So as long
[46:16] as I can live from that um be be it half
[46:20] a year, be it two years, I will make it
[46:23] work. And from that moment onwards, I
[46:26] just said, "Hey, I have to do it." And
[46:29] then then there was no going back. I I I
[46:32] quit at the company. Uh it was really
[46:34] emotional, really hard for me. And uh I
[46:37] made it work. And luckily, I never had
[46:40] to spend a single uh Satoshi from my
[46:44] stack because there was always some
[46:46] Bitcoin company that was willing to
[46:48] support me, willing to support my
[46:50] mission. And uh this is basically my my
[46:54] story. So, how did you um so when you
[46:57] first started your full-time journey and
[47:01] you said that the Bitcoin company
[47:02] supported your journey to go full-time?
[47:04] So, was it more cuz I know that people
[47:07] can get monetized on YouTube and make
[47:09] this like join the Bitcoin uh world,
[47:12] like put your time into Bitcoin, educate
[47:14] people, talk with Bitcoiners, and and
[47:17] move on from uh you know, from the the
[47:21] position you were in before and actually
[47:22] do something you're enjoying. So, did
[47:25] you feel that you got monetized from
[47:27] YouTube first or was it support from
[47:30] companies like people that you that
[47:31] sponsor you? So you would share you know
[47:33] their product like which one came first?
[47:37] Products actually uh came came first.
[47:40] When I quit my job on the day where I
[47:41] quit my job I still had under a thousand
[47:44] followers on YouTube and I still had
[47:46] like maximum a thousand people that
[47:49] listening to my podcast. So the podcast
[47:52] was nowhere near where it is now and it
[47:55] was nowhere near to be profitable.
[47:57] Companies saw a vision. companies saw uh
[48:01] something that that they could be there
[48:03] and they supported me and I'm super
[48:05] thankful for them. I will be forever
[48:07] thankful for for especially for the few
[48:09] for the first few companies. Now it
[48:12] obviously
[48:13] um now there are more companies
[48:16] interested in sponsoring my podcast than
[48:18] I am willing to have as sponsors because
[48:21] I don't want to have like a
[48:23] 10-minut advertisement break. H so now
[48:27] it it it flips uh a little bit where I
[48:30] support the companies, but in the
[48:32] beginning I'm so grateful for the
[48:34] companies that supported me and said
[48:36] like, "Hey, um we think you have a great
[48:39] future. You we think you have a great
[48:41] podcast and I think this could be really
[48:43] great and we would love to um help you
[48:45] out and and support you in any way we we
[48:48] can." So did they reach out to you or
[48:50] did you go looking for them? Uh the
[48:52] first one I reached out because I
[48:55] literally um just started my podcast
[48:57] when I reached out to them. We we got
[48:59] into talks in January. This was the
[49:01] first one. It was the Bitcoin exchange
[49:03] 21 Bitcoin in in Austria. They are in
[49:06] America. Probably nobody knows them
[49:08] because they literally have no service
[49:09] there. So they were the first one to
[49:12] support me and this helped out a lot.
[49:15] All the other sponsors came from
[49:17] themselves actually. Uh so every single
[49:20] other sponsor that I h have uh now
[49:23] because uh they no longer uh uh support
[49:26] me because yeah not not in America uh
[49:29] every single other sponsor came from
[49:32] themselves to me and yeah this is I I
[49:36] thought about maybe reaching out to
[49:38] sponsors but I was also like why should
[49:41] I do it if if they anyways come from
[49:43] themselves so I will just do the best
[49:46] way the best podcast possible And the
[49:49] people that want to partner up with me,
[49:50] they will find me. And then the
[49:52] partnership also starts at a at a better
[49:55] foot. If if they already found me, if
[49:57] they want really want to sponsor me, if
[49:59] they really want to reach out to me,
[50:01] then there's always like an equal thing.
[50:04] If say if I'm coming like, oh, please
[50:06] give me money. Uh it's it might not be
[50:08] the best start of of a relationship
[50:10] also. Right. That is very inspiring.
[50:13] That's inspiring to me starting my new
[50:16] channel. And you know, again, I've been
[50:18] doing it probably for, I don't know,
[50:20] over a month now, 2 months maybe. Um,
[50:23] but not just me, but there's other
[50:25] people that want to start podcasts. And
[50:28] we always encourage new people to start
[50:29] because everybody can reach a different
[50:33] person that maybe uh somebody else can't
[50:35] reach. and it just spreads the message
[50:37] and teaches people who just uh maybe
[50:40] have heard the word Bitcoin and you know
[50:43] they might come across your video or my
[50:45] video and actually uh be interested
[50:48] enough to learn about it because they
[50:50] see something they come across. So, it's
[50:52] it's important to get us out there and
[50:54] hear from real people, you know, hear
[50:56] from uh large accounts too that have so
[50:58] much knowledge and experience, but also
[51:00] from everyday people because a lot of
[51:02] people are everyday people that we're
[51:04] trying to get them to understand the
[51:06] shift here that's happening and uh we
[51:08] want them to be exposed, you know, to
[51:11] it. So, uh they could actually uh begin
[51:13] their journey or understand. So, that is
[51:16] very inspiring. So, thank you for
[51:18] sharing that. Um, and I love to hear
[51:21] about um, people that have had Jeff
[51:23] Booth on early on because he is such a,
[51:28] you know, again, not egoistic. He's got
[51:31] ego death capital, that's his company,
[51:33] but he will join people when they're
[51:35] early on and, you know, inspires people
[51:39] to take that full full journey. So, I'm
[51:42] excited because I'm going to be talking
[51:43] with him at the end of the month and I
[51:46] feel like it makes me a lot more
[51:48] comfortable thinking that he's so down
[51:51] to earth, you know. So, I'm very excited
[51:53] about that. Um, how was it when you like
[51:56] what stage of podcasting were you in
[51:58] when you spoke to Michael Sailor?
[52:00] Because how was that? It's it's so
[52:02] interesting because I was not expecting
[52:05] that at all.
[52:08] I I had a Twitter account and I had my
[52:11] podcast and one day I saw that message
[52:15] pop up in my Twitter notification list.
[52:18] Michael Sailor is following you. And I
[52:21] was not even a little bit excited
[52:23] because I just thought it's a it's a
[52:26] scam. I had 500 different Michael Sailor
[52:30] following me before and it was always
[52:31] like a a scam
[52:34] artist, impersonator. Yeah, as a bot or
[52:39] I was like, "Oh, but there's a blue blue
[52:41] check mark." I was like, "Oh, is this a
[52:43] bot with blue check mark?" And I was
[52:45] like, "Okay." I was like, "Oh, wait. He
[52:48] also has a lot of followers." I'm like,
[52:50] "Oh, like almost all of my people that I
[52:53] follow also follow him." And I checked
[52:55] it out and I was like, "Okay, the handle
[52:57] also seems good." I was so skeptical at
[52:59] first. I was like, "Is he really?" And
[53:02] then I was like, "Oh, that's actually
[53:05] that's actually Michael Sailor following
[53:07] me on Twitter." And I and I had no clue
[53:09] like I have still don't know actually
[53:11] why he did that. Never asked him. And uh
[53:15] in in like an instant I made a tweet of
[53:19] uh screenshotting that he follows me and
[53:22] said like, "Oh, thank you so much, sir.
[53:24] You're an inspiration." He was actually
[53:26] because I was a stock pro before he,
[53:28] Anthony Pompliano and Safodina Moose are
[53:30] the three people that orange build me
[53:32] basically. I never I didn't had any
[53:35] Bitcoin in my personal environment. So I
[53:37] was the first Bitcoiner in my family. So
[53:40] those three people orange build me and I
[53:42] basically told him, "Oh, thank you so
[53:44] much. You orange build me. Um, you made
[53:46] me realize that I should sell all my
[53:48] stocks and I have to go all in on
[53:50] Bitcoin." and I was just saying uh I
[53:53] would love to have you as a guest on my
[53:55] my podcast and and he said just yeah I
[53:57] would love to talk Bitcoin and and and
[53:59] he just responded publicly and uh that
[54:03] that's it and then we had the podcast
[54:06] and you did it in person too. Yeah, that
[54:09] was it's a whole different story
[54:10] actually. Um I that tweet was public. So
[54:15] all my conversation basically with Mike
[54:17] Taylor was public and I said then thank
[54:20] you uh to him when he said uh this thing
[54:23] back and I said oh I DM'd you and then
[54:26] uh the the co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin
[54:30] Prague. Uh Bitcoin Prague is a
[54:33] conference with uh around 10,000
[54:36] participants where Michael Sailor always
[54:38] comes to. He responded and said, "Hey
[54:42] guys, do you want to do it in person in
[54:44] Bitcoin Prague?" And I was like, "I
[54:47] would love to." Then I emailed uh the
[54:50] assistant of Michael Sailor uh if he
[54:53] would also like to do it in person. Uh
[54:54] because like I of course like to do it
[54:57] in person, but it also has to fit his
[54:59] schedule because he's the busy man. So
[55:02] we we did it. I asked her then she said,
[55:05] "Yeah, let's do it." Then um uh then it
[55:09] got all arranged that he because he has
[55:12] a lot to do when he's at Bitcoin Prague
[55:13] with the talks and and the podcast and
[55:15] stuff like that. Then we arranged that
[55:17] and uh then we did a podcast in person
[55:20] in Prague and I was just the the lucky
[55:23] guy sitting there and having the honor
[55:26] of sitting next to Michael and asking
[55:28] him
[55:28] questions. It yeah I'm I'm still blown
[55:31] away that that he did that. And then
[55:33] later he actually also invited me to his
[55:36] 100k uh party in Miami. Um which I was
[55:41] even more surprised that he invites me
[55:43] because yeah okay he comes on the
[55:44] podcast but he's on many podcasts
[55:47] actually. So I was like
[55:49] we he doesn't even think about me. I
[55:52] thought like and actually the the
[55:54] invitation came so late I thought no way
[55:58] I'm going to be invited. And the
[56:00] invitation basically came on 16th of
[56:03] December, something like that, like
[56:05] really really close to to the event. The
[56:07] event was on the 31st of of nove uh
[56:10] December. And yeah, then I completely
[56:13] dismissed all my previous holiday plans
[56:16] for New Year's Eve and canceled all of
[56:18] that and said, "Let's go to Miami."
[56:23] God, that's what a dream come true. you
[56:26] know how Okay, I want to ask you about
[56:28] how the party was and everything too,
[56:30] but like oh my gosh, I'm I'm Did you
[56:34] feel nervous talking to him or did you
[56:35] feel like okay, I'm going to put that
[56:36] aside and just be myself and just uh do
[56:39] what I got to do and just like don't
[56:41] think about it too much like were you
[56:42] were you I was completely I was a
[56:44] nervous frack. It's like people told me
[56:47] that you you don't see it in the
[56:49] interview, but I was super nervous. Like
[56:52] my blood pressure was probably a
[56:54] constant like 200 200 or something like
[56:56] that. Like I was like uh my my heart
[57:00] rate probably looked like I was running
[57:01] a marathon at that point. Uh but I was
[57:06] super nervous, super sweating. Yeah, it
[57:08] it was and it was so like it was the
[57:12] whole day at the conference and it was
[57:14] like at 4:30 p.m. in the evening and I
[57:19] already had almost no voice because I
[57:21] talked the whole day at the conference
[57:23] and I was like, "Oh now I have to
[57:24] talk with Michael. My voice is is
[57:27] missing. It's just not there anymore." H
[57:30] But it was good in the end of the day
[57:32] because like he he did most of the
[57:34] talking anyways. I I could uh sit back
[57:37] and after like 20 30 minutes you get in
[57:42] the you you get in the rhythm. So I uh
[57:45] did like one and a half hours with him.
[57:48] Uh and after so around 20 minutes you
[57:51] you realize oh I'm here it's okay. He's
[57:55] talking really good. I have 500
[57:58] different questions where I can can can
[58:01] go towards. There's like no nowhere a
[58:04] point where I don't know what to ask
[58:07] anymore. So there's always something uh
[58:11] that that comes up and you get a little
[58:13] bit more calm. It also helped that um
[58:17] the the people from Treasure helped me a
[58:19] lot. Um the the Pitkin Prague we
[58:22] treasure made two weeks prior to that a
[58:24] new podcasting studio and they were
[58:27] super professional. There were literally
[58:29] four people behind the cameras and the
[58:32] uh audio that were looking at everything
[58:36] while we were doing it. So I had a
[58:38] really good feeling. Uh I did not have
[58:40] to worry about the technical things. I
[58:42] did not have to worry about any any of
[58:44] those.
[58:46] Uh, Treasure is awesome that he helped
[58:48] me there. Uh, Bitcoin Prague co-founder
[58:51] Matias is awesome that he arranged that
[58:53] whole thing. Without him, it would not
[58:55] have been even I wouldn't have even the
[58:58] idea to that. And then, uh, obviously
[59:01] Michael Sailor that is I had a YouTube
[59:04] account with 2,000 subscribers. I was
[59:07] not big. I I I I was also just starting
[59:11] out of I had I had some growth. Uh but I
[59:16] was just starting out. I'm still not
[59:18] big. I would still consider me a smaller
[59:20] podcast, but uh yeah, he he came on and
[59:24] and uh it it it means a lot to me that
[59:28] people like Jeff Booof and Michael
[59:30] Sailor, they give people chances like
[59:34] that is something so unique. Obviously
[59:37] he like obviously it's good also for him
[59:40] like it's he also gets something like
[59:42] Jeff Boof gets something if he's on the
[59:44] podcast like it's it's not not doing it
[59:47] for nothing
[59:48] but he could do a lot of other things.
[59:52] He's a highly highly highly highly
[59:54] highly paid CEO. The same with Jeff
[59:56] Poof. Like he's really successful. Jeff
[59:58] Poo was a financial freak. He could
[60:00] spend time with his family. He could do
[60:03] whatever he wants to do. He could be on
[60:04] a yacht and just enjoy his life, but he
[60:08] chose from his valuable time to sit down
[60:11] with me one and a half hours. Who am I?
[60:15] Who am I to deserve that? So that that's
[60:18] uh that came a lot in in in my time.
[60:22] Chef Bof was the first one and Michael
[60:24] Sailor was the second one where I really
[60:26] had that moment of like, oh, he is on my
[60:29] podcast. Like how did that happen? Wow.
[60:33] Yeah, that's uh obviously he saw
[60:34] something in you. Obviously he wouldn't
[60:36] go on your show if he thought you were
[60:38] not, you know, something that could be,
[60:40] you know, growing in the future and, you
[60:42] know, you you know, obviously you want
[60:44] to spend time with people that um you
[60:46] know, you think are are worthy, you
[60:48] know, to at least share the word. You
[60:50] know, at least you're you're doing it.
[60:51] you know, you're if you didn't show that
[60:53] you were committed, you know, he was
[60:54] just going to go on someone's show that
[60:56] would disappear tomorrow, you know, but
[60:57] I think that seeing that you are uh
[61:00] committed to what you want to do, you
[61:01] enjoy, you're passionate about it, and
[61:04] you know, he he wanted to spend time
[61:06] with you because of that, the same
[61:07] reason that you chose to leave your job
[61:09] and go full-time is because you have
[61:11] this passion. So, I think passion sees
[61:14] passion. So, he wanted to join you for
[61:16] that reason. And congratulations for
[61:19] doing both of those. That's amazing. And
[61:21] for doing what you did to join uh the
[61:24] Bitcoin world full-time and and
[61:26] everything just kind of came to you. So
[61:28] that's um that's that's amazing. And now
[61:30] you're speaking at the conferences.
[61:32] You're you speak in Prague. You're
[61:33] you're flying all over to different
[61:35] conferences. You're going to be in Vegas
[61:37] this um this May. So I'm super excited
[61:40] cuz I'll get to see you speak uh cuz
[61:42] I'll be there. So um that'll be really
[61:45] fun. We can uh meet up and actually see
[61:47] I can see how tall you are in real life.
[61:49] I want to show you something. I have to
[61:52] see it quickly how I can show you. I can
[61:54] show you like that. This here
[61:59] is
[62:01] me at the Bitcoin Prague event in when
[62:06] was this? This
[62:07] was 2020 was me recording with Michael
[62:13] 2023. This was Bitcoin Prague 2023. And
[62:17] at that time I had no podcast. I had
[62:20] like a a few thousand followers maybe on
[62:23] Twitter but nobody knew me. I did not
[62:26] had made any connections. I went through
[62:28] the whole conference and nobody
[62:30] recognized me. No, nobody knew who who I
[62:33] am. And I was just a huge fanboy of
[62:37] Michael Sailor and
[62:39] Cyos. I wanted to have a picture with
[62:42] with Michael Sailor all of the
[62:44] conference. Like the whole conference I
[62:46] was like searching for him like where is
[62:48] he? I want to have a picture with this
[62:50] man. I want to shake his hand. I want to
[62:53] have a picture with him. This was 2023
[62:55] and at the end of the conference I
[62:58] finally saw him. I was like yeah he's at
[63:00] the Ciphodina Amoose booth. And then I
[63:04] was like oh gosh I can have now a
[63:06] picture of Michael Sailor and Cyodine.
[63:10] I was not running but I was going very
[63:13] fast towards him. So fast that the
[63:17] bodyguard of my gazilla actually came in
[63:20] between me and and really looked at me
[63:23] cuz he thought like oh like a 2 m
[63:25] long guy is all of the sudden coming
[63:28] steaming towards
[63:30] my potential. He's going to try to take
[63:32] you out. That's funny. That's so crazy.
[63:35] Yeah he I slowed down when I saw him. Uh
[63:38] but but he probably would have taken me
[63:40] out if I didn't slow down. And then I
[63:43] just uh interrupted and and very
[63:46] egotistically I said, "Oh, I I would
[63:48] love to just take a picture with the the
[63:50] both of you because I'm the hugest fans
[63:52] and you both of uh you you both
[63:55] basically orange build me in in 2020 and
[63:58] this and that of course come in and it's
[64:01] just so amazing because this was 2023 in
[64:05] June. Nobody knew me. I was a huge
[64:07] fanboy. H I had no connections, no
[64:09] money, nothing in Bitcoin. And then one
[64:13] year later, I interview Michael Sailor
[64:16] on the same conference. It's it's
[64:18] literally one year later. And one and a
[64:20] half years later, I was invited to
[64:23] Michael Sailor's private um 100k
[64:27] party. And now two years later to that
[64:31] image, so another half year later to
[64:33] that, I'm on stage on Bitcoin Prague.
[64:36] uh probably even on the main stage but
[64:38] it's it's not fixed yet uh what I'm
[64:40] speaking about and with whom I'm speak
[64:42] about. So it it's just I think I think
[64:46] if anyone can can take anything away
[64:49] from it, you can do whatever you want in
[64:53] the Bitcoin community because people are
[64:55] actually very nice. I've never rejected
[64:59] any podcast invitation because I love
[65:01] Jeff Boof and he set an example for me.
[65:06] I I take Jeff Boof as a role model and
[65:10] if Jeff Boof is good enough for uh for
[65:15] every podcast that invites him basically
[65:18] then who am I to decline anyone? Who am
[65:22] I to say oh I don't have time for that?
[65:24] And so I try to help anyone out and and
[65:29] try to to do whatever in in my small
[65:31] power I can do. And I think that's uh
[65:34] that that that's kind of the message of
[65:36] like you can do whatever you want in in
[65:38] Bitcoin if you really put in the proof
[65:39] of work and really try to to do
[65:41] something. And I just wanted to show
[65:43] that that that picture. I love it. Thank
[65:45] you so much for sharing it. I feel that
[65:48] you were you did that for me because I
[65:51] hadn't I didn't have a podcast when I
[65:52] got on your show. I thought the same
[65:54] way. Who would even want to speak to me?
[65:56] I'm not a finance person. I'm not a tech
[65:58] person. I'm not somebody who, you know,
[66:00] I didn't think people would want to hear
[66:02] from me. And you having me on meant so
[66:05] much to me because I've been watching
[66:06] your channel for a very long time. Uh I
[66:09] think you're a great interviewer and I
[66:11] look up to you, you know. So for me to
[66:14] be on your show, I was feeling that way
[66:16] about being on yours because I'm like, I
[66:19] know him, you know, I've been watching
[66:20] him. he's, you know, I can't believe I'm
[66:22] going to be talking on his show. This is
[66:23] insane. So, I felt very nervous, you
[66:26] know, before I spoke on yours and um you
[66:29] made me feel so comfortable and you are
[66:32] so humble just like they are. So, it's
[66:34] like whatever they did for you, you're
[66:35] doing for other people. And that's the
[66:38] power of this community. And to show
[66:40] where you went, like how you made that
[66:43] active decision to
[66:45] um go full-time and how supportive this
[66:49] community is for your journey and what
[66:51] you're doing. It made me feel
[66:53] lightheaded like when you're telling the
[66:55] story like I actually feel like how
[66:57] powerful like that powerful feeling of
[66:59] this uh support, you know, is
[67:02] overwhelming. it can be overwhelming and
[67:04] you don't get that a lot of places. So,
[67:07] um you know, sharing that story is
[67:09] incredible. Sharing that picture really
[67:11] puts it into, you know, you know, you
[67:13] actually get to see that was you before
[67:15] you even started your own podcast, you
[67:17] know, when you were just there, you
[67:19] know, try and excited to get a picture.
[67:21] Um, how was the actual party when you
[67:23] went?
[67:25] That was that was awesome. Um, I I went
[67:28] there. Uh I I there there was an option
[67:31] to take a plus one. So I took my
[67:33] girlfriend uh with me and it was just so
[67:36] awesome. And uh a lot of people said to
[67:39] me previous to the party of like oh
[67:41] there's such an amazing networking
[67:42] community and you can use it as an
[67:44] opportunity and I said like
[67:46] no th this is a celebration. I work now
[67:50] two years as hard as possible to do
[67:54] something in the Bitcoin community to
[67:55] provide value for the community. This is
[67:58] my payoff. Th this is my personal payoff
[68:02] for for the hard work and I will just
[68:05] relax, enjoy the party and talk with
[68:09] whoever whoever I want to talk and have
[68:11] a good time. And that's what I did. I
[68:14] came there and I went into every room.
[68:17] He also is uh like most of the party was
[68:21] outside on on was outside in his garden
[68:23] and outside in uh on his yard. But you
[68:27] also opened some uh rooms inside of the
[68:29] house where you can actually
[68:32] Yeah, I didn't see Did I see that? I
[68:36] think I did not see that actually. I'm
[68:38] not sure. Did I see that? Maybe I've
[68:40] seen that. But a lot of different uh
[68:42] things I've seen the the round thing,
[68:44] the big one. And just the inside of the
[68:46] house is it's it's more beautiful than
[68:49] most museums. Honestly, it's it's just
[68:52] amazing uh to see that house and and
[68:54] what amazing cool things he has. He has
[68:57] the second computer. I don't know if he
[69:01] has it in his house or he just put it
[69:04] there for the party. I mean, maybe it
[69:06] was just uh quickly there for the party,
[69:09] but there was the second computer that
[69:12] ever was connected to the Bitcoin
[69:15] network. And that was like like we have
[69:17] that computer like that. Seeing that
[69:20] like historical uh piece was really
[69:22] cool. And then I just roamed around the
[69:25] party and enjoyed it and and had a good
[69:27] time. I I was eating and drinking and
[69:29] and I just uh enjoyed the time with my
[69:32] girlfriend. And uh yeah, did people
[69:34] recognize you? Yeah, obviously like uh a
[69:37] lot of people were also on my podcast
[69:39] already. Like I knew a lot of people. Um
[69:42] it it was a a really cool Bitcoiner
[69:45] party. So I I knew a lot of people there
[69:48] and a lot of people like your friends
[69:49] like you just at a party with your
[69:51] friends and this is the crazy part. One
[69:53] and a half years ago when when the
[69:57] picture that I showed you, nobody knew
[69:59] me. I knew nobody and with a lot of hard
[70:03] work for one and a half years. Yeah. Um
[70:05] you get to know people and all of the
[70:07] sudden it's not uh what a party at
[70:10] Michael Sailor. It's like oh I'm I'm
[70:12] meeting friends there.
[70:14] I'm meeting people that I seriously
[70:16] consider friends there. I mean,
[70:18] obviously there are a lot of people I
[70:19] also didn't know there. Um because there
[70:21] also like a lot of micro strategy people
[70:23] there. It was not just Bitcoiners. Um
[70:26] but it was really cool to to to be there
[70:28] and the food was amazing. Obvious like
[70:31] just imagine the the an awesome party
[70:35] and make it 10 times better. And this
[70:37] was basically the party. So like the
[70:38] food was awesome and and everything was
[70:41] amazing. It's like you're just at a
[70:43] party with your peers. You're not going
[70:44] to some party where you're thinking, oh,
[70:46] like when sometimes when you go to a
[70:47] wedding and you think the one the bride
[70:50] or groom invited me, I'm friends with
[70:51] them and I don't know anybody else
[70:52] there. And you're going to go there just
[70:53] with your girlfriend and be walking
[70:55] around and be like, okay, nobody knows
[70:56] us except for the bride and groom and
[70:58] they're busy. So, we're just kind of
[70:59] hanging out trying to make small talk
[71:01] with people we don't know. But here,
[71:02] you're going and you one and a half
[71:04] years later know people like you're
[71:06] going to a party where you're meeting
[71:08] your peers. It's not just strangers um
[71:11] that you're just kind of like showing up
[71:12] feeling uncomfortable. You know, you
[71:14] actually feel like you belong, which is
[71:16] so incredible. And your story is
[71:20] amazing. Like you have such a great
[71:22] journey and so much more, you know,
[71:25] coming up. You know, you're you're a
[71:28] pioneer. you know, you are going from
[71:31] thinking who are these people to like
[71:33] who am I for them to talk to me to now
[71:36] being a leader in the space to be
[71:38] talking on stage um starting in um in
[71:41] Prague and then you know going to other
[71:43] conferences all over the world but now
[71:45] in Vegas and I get to see you in Vegas
[71:47] so I'll be running up to you like I know
[71:49] Robin I've been on his podcast so um now
[71:52] I'll be like that so that'll be that'll
[71:53] be fun um and I get to see how tall you
[71:55] are again now I have at least I won't be
[71:57] as shocked cuz I saw that pictures. So,
[71:58] that'll um be a little bit uh of a
[72:02] buffer. So, that's good. Um I I I don't
[72:05] have security, so Yeah. Yeah. I'll be
[72:08] I'll probably try to walk toward you
[72:10] quickly and I'll fall on something cuz
[72:12] I'm really clumsy. So, you'll see me
[72:13] just kind of face plant. Um you know, so
[72:16] that that's probably going to be my
[72:17] scenario. I'm sure of it. Um so, I just
[72:22] wanted to ask you uh so there's a couple
[72:26] of things. Oh my gosh. Like I feel like
[72:29] I feel like I'm blown away. I don't even
[72:30] know what to say right now. It's like
[72:31] where do I go from that? That's I just
[72:34] wanted to say uh also thank you so much
[72:36] because it was a huge compliment and I
[72:39] appreciate that a lot. Uh sometimes you
[72:42] sometimes you're so into the work that
[72:44] you kind of don't know um how far you
[72:49] have already come. And then
[72:51] conversations like that actually make me
[72:52] realize, oh, oh like I it it's
[72:56] it's not just a daily work. It's like
[72:57] there's actually like a progress over
[72:59] long because if you're really into the
[73:01] daily work and you're just like working
[73:03] every day of like what title do I put
[73:05] there and and which guest the next like
[73:08] you get so closeminded in in that one
[73:11] day sphere that you missed the bigger
[73:14] picture. So I appreciate that a lot
[73:16] because it it just takes me back to the
[73:17] moment of like 2 years ago of that
[73:20] conference and uh it it it makes me
[73:22] realize how um how amazing this
[73:26] community is and and how amazing uh the
[73:29] achievements can be if you put in the
[73:31] proof of work. Yeah. Because you
[73:33] thinking you're right, you don't take
[73:35] that that step back and you don't see it
[73:37] from someone's perspective cuz to you it
[73:38] could feel like it's a long journey. It
[73:40] feels like it's it's a lot of hard work
[73:41] that you've enjoyed, of course, but you
[73:44] doing this every day, you know, grinding
[73:46] for again a great purpose and for
[73:48] something you love to do, but you're
[73:50] doing it because you, you know, again,
[73:52] you enjoy it, but you're not taking that
[73:55] step away to see the way that you look
[73:57] at yourself is different from how other
[73:59] people look at you. And it's nice to
[74:00] hear uh from other people that even
[74:03] though you feel like, okay, I'm putting
[74:05] in the work. I'm enjoying what I do from
[74:07] my side, but seeing how people view you
[74:10] is another situation. You know, it's
[74:12] it's nice to hear because you are the
[74:13] one working hard. You should be able to
[74:15] hear um you know, it gives you energy.
[74:18] It gives you like power like you feel
[74:20] stronger, you know, when you hear uh the
[74:22] truth. You know, people should tell each
[74:23] other um you know, what what it means to
[74:26] them, you know. So, uh, I think
[74:28] that, you know, just it's great that you
[74:32] took that step back and it's great that
[74:34] you can see how far you've come and it
[74:36] is an incredible story. I mean, it's
[74:38] really to make to make me feel
[74:40] lightheaded thinking about how fast that
[74:43] was. You know, that's 2 years, but it's
[74:44] it's a quick, you know, complete
[74:47] transformation of uh it's a big risk
[74:49] that you took, too. But you you just are
[74:51] so passionate about it that to think
[74:53] I've studied all these years to go to
[74:55] school for this one thing. I know so
[74:57] much about it. I'm just going to quit
[74:59] that altogether. I mean, I'm sure you
[75:01] figured you could always go back if this
[75:03] doesn't work out. You know, you could do
[75:04] something in that field of work. It's
[75:06] not like you can't. But just to take
[75:08] that step and have the bravery to go
[75:10] forward and try something and not feel
[75:13] afraid to try new things is really
[75:16] inspiring for people. And um just
[75:19] even how far you've come is incredible.
[75:22] Like knowing that that that's like a
[75:23] fairy tale, you know, story, you know,
[75:25] it's like a fairy tale story for um for
[75:29] you. And honestly, I'm trying to
[75:31] remember when I first started watching
[75:32] your show. If I could cuz I got into it
[75:35] in 2020 and I feel like when I started
[75:38] watching your show, I know it wasn't
[75:40] that it wasn't in 2020 cuz you started
[75:42] in 2023, right?
[75:44] So, but when I first came across one of
[75:47] your podcasts, it came up like on my
[75:49] feed or maybe I saw you on on on Twitter
[75:52] first. I'm not sure how I came across,
[75:54] but you sounded like you'd been doing it
[75:56] forever, you know? It didn't sound like
[75:58] you just started. I had no idea you just
[76:00] started. I was just like, "Oh, this
[76:01] guy's really good to hear, you know, so
[76:04] uh he must be, you know, an OG or
[76:06] something." You know, I didn't I didn't
[76:07] realize you were a newer at it. You know
[76:09] what I mean? So, that's amazing. So, you
[76:11] definitely sound like you know what
[76:12] you're talking about. you're very um
[76:14] comfortable and you make your guests
[76:16] feel very comfortable. So um thank you
[76:19] so much. Yeah. So definitely we should u
[76:22] meet up out there. That'd be awesome.
[76:23] You know, I'd love to to hang out in
[76:25] real life. You know, it's so easy to
[76:27] talk to you and everything. And thank
[76:28] you so much for joining me. This is also
[76:30] a dream come true for me because just
[76:32] having somebody like you on my show,
[76:34] just even the two-month journey I've
[76:36] been on compared to your 2-year journey.
[76:38] Um and the, you know, I'm I'm working,
[76:41] you know, I still work. this is my
[76:42] part-time, you know, thing that I'm
[76:44] doing, but I totally love it. And, uh,
[76:46] knowing that people like Jeff Booth and
[76:48] tomorrow I'm actually speaking to
[76:49] Natalie Bernell, so that's insane to me.
[76:53] I feel like she is I'm trying to keep
[76:55] myself calm about that one. Um, but just
[76:58] knowing that in 2 months, how much can
[77:00] change when you just make a decision,
[77:03] you know, a a conscious decision to do
[77:05] something like learning about Bitcoin,
[77:07] you know, instead of just sitting on the
[77:09] sidelines. So, thank you so much again
[77:11] for joining me today. I had the most
[77:14] amazing conversation. I can't wait to
[77:15] share it. And I've actually decided to
[77:18] step up my game because before I was
[77:20] putting out about two videos a week and
[77:22] now I'm doing every other day. So, I can
[77:25] get this out faster than I originally
[77:26] thought I would. So, I'm very happy to
[77:28] share it and I look forward to it. Thank
[77:31] you so much for having me. Thank you,
[77:33] Robin. Have a good rest of the day and
[77:36] I'll see you in Vegas. I'll definitely
[77:39] see you in Vegas. It will be awesome.
