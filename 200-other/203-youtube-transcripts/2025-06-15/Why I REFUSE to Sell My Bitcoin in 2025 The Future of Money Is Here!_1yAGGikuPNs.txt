[00:00] I know people are even paying a premium
[00:02] for non KYC Bitcoin compared to Bitcoin
[00:05] from an exchange. So, you're also
[00:07] getting these second and third order
[00:09] effects from different Bitcoin miners
[00:11] that it's very easy to measure how
[00:13] they're making the world a better place
[00:14] by what they're doing and then how
[00:16] they've stabilized the grid in so many
[00:18] different areas. When you just think
[00:19] about like game theory playing out in
[00:21] everything, why wouldn't you rather
[00:23] transact in something that has basically
[00:25] no fees and settles immediately?
[00:27] Especially as a circular economy grows,
[00:30] I get paid immediately and I can use
[00:32] that money immediately as I've learned
[00:34] uh dealing with gold a little bit. It's
[00:36] a terrible medium of exchange, one cuz
[00:38] it's so heavy, it's super hard to
[00:40] transport. But the other thing too that
[00:42] a lot of people don't realize, if you
[00:44] want to sell your gold for cash,
[00:46] sometimes the difference between the
[00:48] price of gold and spot gold, there might
[00:50] be a 10% difference on the actual price.
[00:52] like as someone who gets paid in
[00:54] Bitcoin, so I feel very fortunate that
[00:56] I'm able to. But I was when I was
[00:58] selling a little bit for like expenses
[01:01] at the end of the month, I'm like
[01:02] telling the person like he's all happy
[01:04] like we're making this exchange and it's
[01:06] like yeah, I'm happy except like I'm not
[01:08] because I'm selling my Bitcoin.
[01:12] [Music]
[01:15] Hi Michael, how you doing in your end?
[01:17] Thanks. Yeah, I'm doing great. Thanks a
[01:18] lot for having me on. I'm really excited
[01:20] to be on here. I've listened to your
[01:22] podcast so many times, so it's really
[01:23] good to actually be able to be on it.
[01:26] Awesome. Thank you so much for for
[01:28] listening. That's that's really cool.
[01:30] Um, and you you work for for Vexel. So,
[01:33] you're a community manager for for for
[01:35] Vexel, if I understood that correct?
[01:37] Yes. So, I do community management for
[01:39] Vexel and then I do have a full-time job
[01:42] at Luxer Technology where I'm mostly
[01:45] working on the ASIC trading desk. And
[01:48] then I also help out Orange Pill App as
[01:51] an ambassador as well. Oh man, you
[01:54] you're in in three different boats
[01:56] directly.
[01:58] Yeah, a few different ones. Uh all of
[02:00] them have been extremely rewarding and
[02:02] awesome. Uh yeah, Beexel has been really
[02:05] cool with doing their community
[02:06] management as they try and grow in uh
[02:10] well across the world but across Canada
[02:12] for where I live. Uh really cool. Um,
[02:15] and I think today's uh topic as as we
[02:17] discussed before with with circular
[02:19] economy and spending bitcoin is is super
[02:21] interesting. Um, why why do you think
[02:24] it's so interesting? Like why do you
[02:26] think it's so important that we spend
[02:28] our bitcoin that we have a circular
[02:29] economy the the media exchange side of
[02:32] things for Bitcoin? Yeah, I have a ton
[02:35] of thoughts about all of those things.
[02:37] So, I'll start with what I noticed uh
[02:40] when I went to my very first Bitcoin
[02:42] meetup in Vancouver.
[02:45] There was I don't know about 40 50
[02:48] people there. I can I was it was
[02:52] awesome. Um and then I was talking to
[02:54] different people. I had some Bitcoin. I
[02:57] hadn't done that much with it and one of
[03:00] the people showed me um Bitcoin moving
[03:03] across the Lightning Network and this
[03:05] was in 2021. So it wasn't working as
[03:09] good as it is now, but it was still
[03:11] working very fast, very quick. It ended
[03:14] up in my wallet pretty much immediately.
[03:17] And up until that point, I had always
[03:18] been told, "Oh, Bitcoin's old
[03:20] technology. Uh, it's slow. Like, we need
[03:23] all of these other things." Uh, to
[03:26] because Bitcoin can't do this or that.
[03:29] And in that moment is exactly I was
[03:31] almost a maxi and then as soon as I saw
[03:33] that, I became a maxi. So what a lot of
[03:38] places in Vancouver have done is they
[03:41] accept Bitcoin and usually they accept
[03:44] lightning. So we're really lucky that we
[03:47] have a company called Coinos in
[03:49] Vancouver who has got so many people to
[03:52] accept Bitcoin. And then we also have
[03:55] the community of Vancouver. Uh so some
[03:58] people such as Leo who are helping
[04:01] businesses get set up on uh Lightning as
[04:04] well. He's even helping some of them set
[04:06] up their own nodes and every lightning
[04:08] nodes. And so when we have a community
[04:12] that's really embracing it, people are
[04:14] seeing that
[04:16] technology. Uh it's just really
[04:18] important
[04:19] for all of the effects of it. And what's
[04:23] really cool is I mean you're way more
[04:25] self- sovereign accepting Bitcoin. And
[04:28] then we're starting to see second and
[04:30] third order effects in Vancouver because
[04:32] there are about a hundred businesses
[04:34] accepting Bitcoin. So what ends up
[04:37] happening is, you know, one block of
[04:40] businesses, one or two of them accept
[04:42] Bitcoin, then they see more people
[04:45] coming in and accepting Bitcoin than
[04:47] other businesses want to know what's
[04:48] going on. So we're really lucky in that
[04:51] sense. And then we also uh do certain
[04:55] meetups at places that accept Bitcoin.
[04:57] So, we're helping grow the community
[05:00] that we want to see. Uh, and so, yeah, I
[05:03] think it's really important it be used
[05:05] as a medium of exchange
[05:07] because all of the second and third
[05:10] order effects, they're hard to measure,
[05:12] but we are seeing them play out in real
[05:14] time. And also just the merchants who
[05:17] have like Bitcoin accepted here,
[05:20] stickers, stuff like that. You people
[05:23] are seeing that. Um, and just that brand
[05:27] recognition really and just that it's
[05:30] actually easy to use and it settles
[05:32] quicker than a credit card payment goes
[05:35] through. Not a credit card settles, but
[05:37] it settles quicker than a credit card
[05:40] payment is approved, which is crazy.
[05:42] Yeah, it's a it's a good point. it it's
[05:45] uh so quick and and right now like
[05:48] onchain it's even uh quick and cheap
[05:51] because like there's not a lot going on
[05:53] on chain for the transactions but
[05:54] lightning is is yeah as as the name says
[05:57] lightning lightning fast yeah and then
[06:00] there's just so many uh different
[06:01] options now with lightning liquid fetti
[06:05] um just all of those different ones uh
[06:07] and some apps that are combining them uh
[06:09] making it easier and easier
[06:11] and another thing too that I really like
[06:14] about it is all of the people I know
[06:17] that are accepting Bitcoin, they want to
[06:20] get paid in Bitcoin, uh they want you to
[06:23] transact that way. And it's almost like
[06:26] more of a respectful manner when you pay
[06:29] them in Bitcoin because you know that
[06:31] that's what they want. They'd rather
[06:33] have that than fiat. Uh which which is
[06:36] really cool to see and we keep seeing
[06:37] that grow. That's interesting. like why
[06:41] is it uh like why do you see that it's
[06:43] more respectful in in Bitcoin versus
[06:46] fiat?
[06:47] Yeah, that's a good question. So, for me
[06:50] personally, I would rather get paid in
[06:51] Bitcoin. Uh and if I'm buying from a
[06:54] merchant, you know, who's selling
[06:55] something for $10 to $50, uh they're
[06:59] putting some of their savings in
[07:00] Bitcoin. Uh and they're supporting the
[07:03] community. Maybe they're coming to some
[07:05] of the events. Uh they're advertising
[07:07] that they accept Bitcoin. I just Yeah, I
[07:10] find it more respectful because I know
[07:12] they're saving in Bitcoin. I know that's
[07:14] what they want. Uh you're saving the
[07:16] transaction fee. Uh yeah. So that's
[07:20] that's what I think on it being more
[07:22] respectful. Interesting. Do you think
[07:24] that uh also for Bitcoin we need to
[07:29] embrace spending bitcoins? like before
[07:31] you you already described the side of
[07:34] like why it's good for for the
[07:36] individual and and the merchant uh to
[07:38] have medium exchange of Bitcoin, but do
[07:40] you think it's also important for the
[07:42] overall adoption story of of Bitcoin to
[07:45] have it also be used as a medium of
[07:49] exchange?
[07:51] Yes, 100%. And there's people uh who I
[07:54] really respect in the space who have
[07:56] said Bitcoin will fail if it's not used
[07:58] as a medium of exchange. And I totally
[08:01] understand that point. I get that. The
[08:04] other thing, it can't be just a store of
[08:07] value. It has to have more utility than
[08:09] that. Uh which uh it does and it's so
[08:14] easy to use obviously with all of these
[08:16] different things we've talked about. Um
[08:19] there is uh with with it being a medium
[08:22] of exchange, you do you see like the
[08:24] second and third order effects where
[08:26] people who don't know as much about
[08:28] Bitcoin start getting more interested in
[08:30] Bitcoin and then that ends up growing
[08:32] the network and that's really good to
[08:36] see. It's also when you just think about
[08:39] like game theory playing out in
[08:40] everything, why wouldn't you rather
[08:42] transact in something that has basically
[08:45] no fees and settles immediately? Uh when
[08:49] I used to own a small business, uh
[08:52] sometimes it would
[08:53] take four business days for money from
[08:56] credit cards or online payments to end
[08:58] up in our bank account. So 4 days before
[09:01] I could use that money. Whereas with
[09:03] Bitcoin, uh especially as the circular
[09:06] economy grows, I get paid immediately
[09:08] and I can use that money immediately. Um
[09:11] even like game theory suggests that
[09:14] that's the way it'll play out and then
[09:17] that just fosters more adoption. It's
[09:19] yeah the the first time someone on the
[09:22] podcast said that actually uh and you
[09:24] probably aware of that Jeff Poof said it
[09:27] on the on my podcast if Bitcoin fails as
[09:30] a medium of exchange it will also fail
[09:32] as a store of value. It's it's a hard
[09:34] concept for me to grasp because we have
[09:36] a lot of assets that uh failed as a
[09:38] medium of exchange like gold and are
[09:41] still the biggest asset. I mean the the
[09:44] argument against that is like it it
[09:47] could be so much bigger. It could be so
[09:49] much bigger if it also is used as a mean
[09:51] of exchange for everyone. But I'm still
[09:53] not 100% sure if um meaning of exchange
[09:58] is required in order to have the store
[10:01] of value. I'm I'm 100% uh convinced of
[10:04] the other side of it that we need the
[10:06] store of value without the store of
[10:08] value to have the media exchange because
[10:11] why would they use it if there's no
[10:13] value in that and I do think it's
[10:16] inevitable that medium exchange uh comes
[10:19] but that experiment is interesting what
[10:22] if we don't spend it because if we don't
[10:25] spend it and just keep it um uh uh price
[10:29] and unfortunately price is is a huge
[10:32] adoption factor. When price goes up,
[10:34] people uh come come to Bitcoin. I'm
[10:37] still I'm still wrestling with with that
[10:40] point. And you you're right, like people
[10:43] that so much smarter than me like Jeff
[10:45] Booof uh saying that and and have a hard
[10:49] time challenging him. But that's one
[10:51] thing I'm I'm just really wrestling with
[10:53] like why is that? I mean I guess if
[10:57] everyone is focused on the price
[11:00] only maybe uh we we kind of lose the
[11:04] focus on it being spent but I think then
[11:07] it's more important that we do self
[11:08] custody and and operate full nodes. So I
[11:12] I'm just I have to reinvite also Jeff
[11:15] Boo on on that manner like I have to
[11:17] challenge him challenge him more on on
[11:19] that. I I he probably will uh he'll
[11:23] probably show me why why it is like
[11:25] that. Yeah. Well, I'll expand on that a
[11:28] little bit. So, with gold, the narrative
[11:30] still is that it is a medium of
[11:33] exchange. So, when I talk to people,
[11:35] especially who are gold bugs, uh they
[11:38] always bring up how, you know, they can
[11:40] exchange their gold for cash in a day.
[11:42] Um if anything went wrong in the world,
[11:44] their gold still has value. And so I
[11:47] think the narrative that gold still is a
[11:49] medium of exchange exists
[11:52] and as I've learned uh dealing with gold
[11:55] a little bit uh it's a terrible medium
[11:58] of exchange one cuz it's so heavy uh and
[12:02] it's super hard to transport. But the
[12:04] other thing too that a lot of people
[12:05] don't realize, if you want to sell your
[12:07] gold for cash, sometimes the difference
[12:10] between the price of gold and spot gold,
[12:14] there might be a 10% difference on the
[12:16] actual price. So say it's trading at,
[12:18] you know, around $3,300 an ounce right
[12:20] now. You might actually only be getting
[12:23] $3,000 in cash if you're actually
[12:25] exchanging it for cash.
[12:28] So part of the reason Bitcoin works
[12:32] better as a medium of exchange is the
[12:36] low fees and just how uh like
[12:39] transportable it is. Um which I know you
[12:41] know this but uh that's just if the
[12:45] narrative of gold is alive that it's a
[12:47] medium of exchange and we know Bitcoin
[12:49] is a better medium of exchange, it's
[12:52] going to just continue to go down that
[12:53] route and just increase adoption and
[12:55] everything. Um, would it fail if it
[12:59] didn't have that if it wasn't a medium
[13:02] of exchange? I think you no matter what,
[13:05] you want it to at least have the
[13:07] narrative because gold sure does and it
[13:09] has the biggest market cap and it's not
[13:12] a very good medium of exchange, but
[13:13] people still believe that narrative.
[13:16] Do do you think that medium of exchange
[13:19] is kind of the more important narrative
[13:21] overall than the store of value one? No,
[13:24] I don't. Um, I mean, I think the most
[13:27] important narrative is just the
[13:28] sovereignty of it and being able to keep
[13:30] your Bitcoin in cold storage. Uh,
[13:34] storing it properly.
[13:37] The both are important. Uh, the problem
[13:41] I have
[13:42] with number go up is just sometimes it
[13:47] doesn't bring out the best
[13:48] characteristics of Bitcoin. Um but that
[13:50] obviously number go up and store of
[13:52] value has been a really good uh
[13:54] narrative. Uh with store of value though
[13:58] it as long as you've had a time frame of
[14:00] at least four years it's been the best
[14:02] type of savings account you can have. Um
[14:04] I do see that continuing to be the case.
[14:08] So it's just a combination
[14:11] of those three things really that kind
[14:13] of go hand in hand. Um, and we are
[14:18] obviously still really early with
[14:20] adoption, um, with people using it as a
[14:23] medium of exchange. I know I'm super
[14:25] lucky, like living around the Vancouver
[14:27] area where, uh, within, well, within a
[14:31] day's drive, there's probably about
[14:33] 120 places I could go to that accept
[14:36] Bitcoin. Uh but my friend Cole and I uh
[14:41] in one day we went to 23 different
[14:43] merchants in Vancouver that accept
[14:45] Bitcoin just to be able to see how many
[14:47] like we could go to and transact at in a
[14:50] day. And being able to see that, see the
[14:54] different people who are accepting it uh
[14:57] is really eye opening and just makes the
[15:00] whole space so much better.
[15:02] And the narrative of giving, you know,
[15:05] small business owners, well, any
[15:08] individual that kind of uh
[15:11] responsibility and opportunity uh is
[15:14] just so important.
[15:16] Yeah, it's super interesting with with
[15:18] Canada. There there's a lot of strong
[15:21] Bitcoiners uh coming out of Canada, but
[15:24] it feels like the the politics doesn't
[15:27] support that. It's more more grassroots
[15:29] and uh uh not at all from the top down
[15:32] anything.
[15:34] No, bottom up. Uh which is it's pretty
[15:36] crazy how Bitcoin has done so much from
[15:39] the bottom up. And I've heard people be
[15:42] like, "Oh yeah, Bitcoin adoption goes
[15:44] well in Canada because Canada needs it."
[15:47] And I don't know if that's the case or
[15:50] not, but there's just so many people
[15:53] that are curious uh and that want
[15:57] better. they want to build the future
[15:58] they want to see. Uh that's what I see
[16:01] when I'm around all of the Bitcoin
[16:02] people. So yeah, we're we're really
[16:05] fortunate to be able to have the growth
[16:07] adoption uh the quality of people in the
[16:10] space um even though we don't
[16:13] necessarily get the most support from
[16:16] elected officials.
[16:17] H it's super interesting. uh you when
[16:21] you're doing the community managing and
[16:22] and you talk with a lot of Bitcoiners, I
[16:25] I I I presume.
[16:27] Yeah. What are the the the most
[16:30] interesting stories and the most
[16:31] interesting things that you you hear
[16:33] about uh Bitcoin that you might miss on
[16:35] on online places?
[16:38] Yeah, that's a good
[16:41] question. Lots of demand for nonkyc
[16:44] Bitcoin, that's for sure. Um, one of the
[16:47] more interesting stories uh that I heard
[16:50] from someone is
[16:52] that well just that how they're able to
[16:55] transact not quite across the world but
[16:58] in Europe um and Canada using the Vexel
[17:03] app. So that's been really cool to see
[17:06] uh someone actually doing that. Uh I
[17:09] haven't really traveled that much since
[17:10] I've uh been doing community management
[17:13] for Vexel, but yeah, someone who I met
[17:17] originally met some of the team um I
[17:20] believe at like the conference in
[17:23] Amsterdam was interested in Dexel, tried
[17:25] it out while he was in Europe in a few
[17:27] different spots and then came to
[17:30] Vancouver and we had a mutual
[17:33] connection. So, we were able to connect
[17:34] through the app and then he bought some
[17:39] Bitcoin off of me and then before you
[17:42] know it, I was getting either a message
[17:44] from him or someone else I know being
[17:47] like, "Hey, do you know this person? I
[17:48] want to uh sell to them or he was asking
[17:52] he wants to buy off this person." And
[17:54] so, within like I don't know a week of
[17:56] him landing in British Columbia, he was
[17:59] already buying off numerous people in uh
[18:01] Vancouver. And then I know he's been
[18:04] buying in other places in Canada as
[18:06] well. Uh which is it's just really good
[18:09] to see like how it is working. And then
[18:13] with the team uh being in the Czech
[18:15] Republic, uh they have I I think they
[18:19] might have mentioned it on the podcast
[18:20] before, but someone was selling frozen
[18:23] squid that they had just caught. And so
[18:26] someone was selling frozen squid for um
[18:29] or fresh maybe for Bitcoin. Um, and it's
[18:32] like it's working almost like a farmers
[18:34] market would work uh in certain places,
[18:37] which is really cool. That that's that's
[18:40] awesome to hear. That's actually a topic
[18:43] I think that comes really short on the
[18:46] podcast, the value of non KYC Bitcoin.
[18:51] How do you look at that? Uh, and and why
[18:53] it's important to to have uh non KYC
[18:56] Bitcoin versus KYC Bitcoin? Yeah, it's
[18:59] really good to see some people who are
[19:02] getting into Bitcoin later than I did
[19:05] are buying 100% non-KYC Bitcoin. And the
[19:10] main benefits of that are
[19:13] uh well, I mean, you're not giving up
[19:16] all your information. Uh I remember
[19:18] signing into an app, you know, you do
[19:20] the Face ID scan, couple passwords. uh
[19:24] they don't encourage you to take it uh
[19:28] into self- custody necessarily depending
[19:31] on which app. There's some that are
[19:32] better than others. With nonkyc
[19:37] uh you just don't have
[19:38] to deal with any of those things which
[19:41] is really nice. And I mean, you're just
[19:42] you're keeping the government, the
[19:45] reporting agencies out of your Bitcoin,
[19:48] which why do they need to know if I'm
[19:51] spending, you know, $5 on a coffee or
[19:53] what I have in savings?
[19:56] Um, the other nice thing too
[19:59] with the non KYC, especially if you're
[20:03] paying with Bitcoin, uh, depending on
[20:06] how like the merchants's accepting
[20:07] Bitcoin, there's no way to tell like
[20:11] that I bought something from that
[20:12] merchant, whereas, you know, if you use
[20:14] your credit card, it's linked to your
[20:15] credit card, your bank account, all of
[20:17] that. Uh, so it's just it's a better way
[20:20] to buy Bitcoin. And I know people are
[20:24] even paying a premium for non KYC
[20:27] Bitcoin compared to Bitcoin from an
[20:29] exchange. Uh which shows that there's
[20:32] extra value there.
[20:34] Yeah. Like people
[20:36] are
[20:37] um they want the non-K Bitcoin so much
[20:41] that they are willing to jump through
[20:45] different hoops to get it and also then
[20:49] pay a premium premium. So there seems to
[20:51] be something important they want to
[20:54] maybe prepare for, prevent for uh which
[20:57] is which is really
[20:59] interesting. Why do you think this is
[21:01] important? Like when you look at the
[21:03] future, maybe there's like uh some some
[21:05] law coming. I mean in Europe we have
[21:07] this currently uh this travel rule which
[21:10] is really really bad. I mean the reality
[21:13] right now is not as bad but um if if
[21:16] this all comes like that it it will be
[21:19] probably really bad. I don't know how it
[21:20] looks in in Canada. I don't also don't
[21:22] know how it looks in America. Um, but
[21:25] why do you think this this might be a
[21:27] good thing for for future preparations
[21:30] to have non KYC Bitcoin?
[21:33] Yeah, the main reason is just it's so
[21:37] mobile being having non KYC Bitcoin. Uh,
[21:41] and the travel stuff like I mean you're
[21:44] not allowed to travel with over $10,000
[21:45] in cash. Um but non KYC Bitcoin
[21:50] uh the reason I have my non KYC Bitcoin
[21:54] is I know I can do anything with it in
[21:57] the future at my own free will. Whereas
[22:02] uh any KYC Bitcoin, it's mostly likely
[22:06] tied to some type of exchange, some type
[22:10] of business um which uh wherever they're
[22:14] they reside in uh they probably have to
[22:17] give up that information uh to like
[22:20] government or police in the future if
[22:22] they it was ever requested. So it's just
[22:25] another layer of protection essentially.
[22:29] Uh, and you know, knock on wood, never
[22:31] going to have to use it, but I like
[22:34] having that option. Um, yeah, people are
[22:37] spending more effort to get nonkyc
[22:40] Bitcoin. And that's one of the good
[22:42] things with Vexel is that they have made
[22:44] it so much easier to be able to do that.
[22:47] And then building that trusted network.
[22:51] even just building that trusted network
[22:54] and finding different merchants, people
[22:56] that you can uh exchange Bitcoin for,
[23:00] goods, services. Um you're building a
[23:04] stronger network no matter what happens
[23:07] in the future. Uh but like we're really
[23:09] lucky like you know we have a butcher,
[23:12] we have different restaurants. having
[23:14] those in your network if anything did
[23:16] change in the future uh like just makes
[23:20] it stronger and more mobile. So it's
[23:24] kind of similar to let's say self
[23:27] custody where if you just look at the
[23:30] setup right now like oh you have it in
[23:32] exchange you have it on in self custody
[23:35] you might think oh like why would I uh
[23:38] go through the hustle through a self
[23:39] custody um but if you actually look at
[23:42] what you're gaining in sovereignty it
[23:45] makes the little bit of extra hustle bit
[23:47] of extra education uh and self-
[23:49] responsibility that you get from that
[23:51] actually worth doing the thing and in
[23:54] the same way uh you're saying like non
[23:57] KYC is is uh the the better way in that
[24:01] regard really interesting is do you have
[24:04] advice for people that have 100% KYC now
[24:08] do sorry do I have what for if you have
[24:10] advice for people that now have like a
[24:13] 100% in in KYC they never bought outside
[24:16] of an exchange so myself personally um
[24:20] and what other people I've seen have
[24:23] been doing is slowly getting rid of that
[24:27] KYC stack and
[24:30] uh making a non KYC stack. So I have uh
[24:36] I do get paid 100% in Bitcoin from
[24:39] Luxer. Uh so that's awesome. Um but I do
[24:42] have obviously bills to pay every month.
[24:44] Uh so I've slowly been getting rid of my
[24:47] KYC stack. um usually using Vexel to uh
[24:53] sell that to uh people from the app. And
[24:58] so yeah, what I've what I've been doing
[24:59] is just slowly getting rid of it. And
[25:02] then um I have a non-KYC stack uh that
[25:06] is slowly growing and yeah, just getting
[25:10] rid of the KYC stack takes a little bit
[25:14] of time. um where I am in Canada like I
[25:18] do have to pay taxes on capital gains.
[25:20] So um just recording that uh like as uh
[25:25] like keeping track of that as well. And
[25:29] yeah, it's a little bit of a process. I
[25:31] know some other people too, they just
[25:33] slowly have kind of been doing the same
[25:35] thing, you know, selling a little bit
[25:36] every month but then buying non KYC
[25:39] Bitcoin in the same month. So all
[25:43] basically like spending and replacing
[25:44] just like I would at a merchant.
[25:46] Interesting. Yeah. By the way, how do
[25:49] you feel about uh uh Canada politics? Do
[25:52] you do you see that at all? I I just
[25:54] heard from the news that there is a new
[25:57] new guy that just came in.
[26:00] Yeah. So he just came in. Um he hasn't
[26:04] really talked about Bitcoin that much. I
[26:06] think maybe he said he didn't like it
[26:08] when it was at $5,000 or something. So,
[26:11] I mean, we know he was wrong back then
[26:13] about it. Hasn't talked about it very
[26:15] much. Uh, our other option to get in had
[26:19] talked about Bitcoin before. Hadn't
[26:21] brought it up as much lately, but he's a
[26:25] Bitcoiner. Um, the option who didn't get
[26:27] in. Uh, and then we're seeing with like
[26:31] uh the mayor of Vancouver, Ken. Uh, so I
[26:35] was one of the people that talked at
[26:37] their uh, town hall meeting. So I was
[26:41] talking about like the positives of
[26:44] Vancouver accepting Bitcoin, how it's
[26:46] good for the future of the city. Um, so
[26:49] we
[26:49] are seeing a little bit of an uptick.
[26:52] Uh, I mean it might only be one
[26:54] politician, but that's where it starts.
[26:58] And yeah, the no matter what happens,
[27:02] uh, governments are going to print money
[27:05] and Bitcoin is going to continue to go
[27:07] up because of that and many other
[27:10] reasons. But to me, it doesn't make over
[27:14] the long run, it doesn't make too much
[27:16] of a difference of who's in power for
[27:19] like the individual Bitcoin holder. Um,
[27:22] I do think that local and uh nationwide
[27:29] um like politicians should encourage uh
[27:34] different like uh tech startups like
[27:38] such as Bitcoin ones and you know try
[27:40] and grow that industry. uh that's not
[27:43] the easiest thing to do obviously and
[27:46] it's unfortunate that a lot of them
[27:50] uh are uh they're currently no coiners
[27:54] but hopefully they won't be but what Ken
[27:56] has been doing like with the city of
[27:58] Vancouver like really putting it on the
[27:59] radar uh has been incredible and just
[28:04] seeing some of the companies uh around
[28:08] that
[28:09] are growing the Bitcoin space in
[28:11] Vancouver
[28:12] That's another thing too that uh like
[28:15] cuz coinos has got so many people to
[28:17] sign up their business, but we also have
[28:19] other companies in Vancouver such as
[28:21] Mint Green who as a Bitcoin mining
[28:24] company and they're heating the water uh
[28:27] for different utilities um which is
[28:30] really cool to see. and they uh like
[28:33] they um have their setup at a distillery
[28:37] and a brewery um where it like actually
[28:39] heats up the water to make the product.
[28:42] And then we also have um people in
[28:45] Vancouver. There's a company called Coin
[28:47] Cards. So that's been an off-ramp since
[28:51] um like for over 10 years now that
[28:54] you've been able to exchange your
[28:55] Bitcoin for different types of uh like
[28:59] gift cards. And so like we have these
[29:02] businesses that are popping up, some of
[29:04] them have been here for over 10 years
[29:07] and if we were getting more
[29:09] encouragement from our government, um
[29:12] that would only help with it. And even
[29:13] just like more transparency on
[29:17] regulations. Uh but uh part of that is
[29:21] also up to us to um encourage that
[29:24] growth and to go to them and show that
[29:27] that's important to Canadians and why it
[29:29] benefits everyone. Mining is super
[29:32] interesting. Yeah, it it's a no-brainer
[29:34] politically. If even if you hate
[29:37] Bitcoin, you have to see that having
[29:40] mining as a a grid stabilizer as
[29:44] something that can be dynamically um set
[29:48] in there and it's it's way better than
[29:50] AI mining uh AI uh data centers or any
[29:54] other data centers because you can
[29:56] literally switch it off and on how you
[29:57] how you want and very easily and very
[30:00] quickly also. So mining makes bitcoin
[30:04] mining makes politically so much sense
[30:07] that if you are against
[30:10] that you you really have an agenda like
[30:14] you you don't have an other opinion you
[30:15] have to you have to have an agenda. Uh
[30:18] if you're against bitcoin maybe you you
[30:20] just don't believe in deflationary money
[30:21] and sound money and sovereignty rights
[30:23] and all those things. I I don't get how
[30:25] how you could not believe in those
[30:27] things, but uh it's a it's yeah, it's a
[30:31] fair assessment that if you're not into
[30:33] those things, but with mining, it makes
[30:36] a whole lot of sense. Like you you you
[30:38] cannot be against Bitcoin mining from a
[30:41] political standpoint just just just is
[30:44] my opinion.
[30:46] Yeah, I completely agree. Uh, and since
[30:48] I've been working at Luxer, uh, first
[30:51] off, like all the people I work with are
[30:54] so smart and hardworking. And then I go
[30:57] and talk to people who are, uh, Bitcoin
[31:00] mining from anywhere from one machine to
[31:04] tens of thousands thousands. And some of
[31:08] these operators, I feel like they're the
[31:10] smartest, most efficient
[31:13] uh operators like in the world, like in
[31:16] any type of business. It is incredible
[31:18] what they're doing, the efficiencies
[31:20] they're creating, the um just how
[31:25] they're helping stabilize grids. And
[31:27] then so many people are looking at it in
[31:31] um a lot of them are doing it in similar
[31:34] but like different ways essentially.
[31:36] Whereas like you know you you hear
[31:38] stories about um like the Bitcoin mining
[31:42] um that's like helping like with the
[31:44] gorilla restoration place. Uh there's
[31:47] another Bitcoin mining that is because
[31:49] they're Bitcoin mining, it's encouraging
[31:51] the use of tires to be recycled. So,
[31:55] you're also getting these second and
[31:56] third order effects from different
[31:59] Bitcoin miners that it's very easy to
[32:02] measure how they're making the world a
[32:04] better place by what they're doing and
[32:06] then how they've stabilized the grid in
[32:08] so many different areas, how it makes
[32:11] sense in certain areas
[32:13] to build more electricity for more
[32:17] people because, you know, you're going
[32:18] to have a Bitcoin miner as a tenant.
[32:21] There's there's so many different ways
[32:22] that these companies are making the
[32:24] world a better place. And then it's also
[32:28] um from everything I've seen in red,
[32:30] it's the industry that uses the most
[32:33] green energy out of any industry, which
[32:38] like you were saying kind of now anyone
[32:40] who disagrees with Bitcoin mining, like
[32:43] you must not have like read anything
[32:45] about it for the last like three or four
[32:47] years because even the media now is for
[32:49] the most part pretty positive towards it
[32:52] because it's really hard to deny such
[32:55] measurable
[32:56] uh like second order effects that are
[32:58] coming out of Bitcoin mining. Let's take
[33:00] a break for a moment and appreciate the
[33:03] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[33:06] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[33:09] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[33:12] of showing that you are a true
[33:14] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[33:17] dropped a completely new and amazing
[33:19] Genesis edition of their watch
[33:22] collections. You have the date of the
[33:24] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[33:28] and of course also the block height and
[33:30] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[33:34] the level of detail they put in in this
[33:36] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[33:39] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[33:42] down in the descriptions. I love those
[33:44] watches so so much. And now if you have
[33:47] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[33:50] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[33:52] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[33:54] to deal with that. The first way is you
[33:56] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[33:59] entry for you to get into the
[34:01] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[34:04] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[34:07] super simple and secure way. And if you
[34:10] check out the link in the description,
[34:12] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[34:15] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[34:18] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[34:21] partner in terms of how to get the most
[34:24] out of your sovereignty. They will
[34:26] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[34:30] that is perfect for your individual
[34:32] situation. They will show you how you
[34:35] can secure your own devices. Securing
[34:38] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[34:39] have to keep all your devices secure.
[34:42] One topic that is overlooked often is
[34:44] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[34:47] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[34:50] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[34:52] place already? And last but not least,
[34:54] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[34:56] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[34:59] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[35:04] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[35:07] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[35:10] be for the first time ever speaking at
[35:12] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[35:15] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[35:18] really looking forward to seeing all of
[35:20] you there. You can get your ticket in
[35:22] the link down in the description of
[35:24] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[35:26] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[35:30] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[35:32] there. Yeah, we had in 2021 a massive
[35:36] uh push that Bitcoin is bad for the
[35:39] environment and unfortunately some
[35:42] traces of that are still here.
[35:45] But in the last four years, we have done
[35:47] such a great job. And when I say we, I
[35:50] mean the whole Bitcoin community um has
[35:53] such an has done such an amazing job of
[35:55] just bringing the facts and the science
[35:58] behind all of that. Why Bitcoin is
[36:00] really good uh to the table and making
[36:03] great reports, making great uh things.
[36:06] And even big um big companies that maybe
[36:10] we even disagree with uh like Black
[36:13] Rockck, they're bringing out things to
[36:15] to to shape the narrative for Bitcoin
[36:18] because that's the narrative where the
[36:20] evidence is. Uh you can also have a
[36:22] narrative against Bitcoin, but that's
[36:24] there's no evidence on that narrative.
[36:27] uh and I think KPMG, one of the big
[36:30] four, uh they also brought up a really
[36:33] interesting paper around why Bitcoin
[36:35] mining is is is good for the environment
[36:37] if I remember correctly. So there's a
[36:40] lot of the the narrative uh has changed
[36:44] because big players uh realized it that
[36:49] it's better to be for Bitcoin against uh
[36:51] and not against Bitcoin. he kind of
[36:53] realized uh it's it's better to join the
[36:56] team uh versus to to fight that team
[36:59] because that team is so freaking good.
[37:03] Yeah. And the other thing too like even
[37:05] when you say like we've done a good job
[37:09] uh uh like showing what the like real
[37:12] narrative is uh everyone who is working
[37:16] in Bitcoin is working for other
[37:19] Bitcoiners which I think is something
[37:21] that's
[37:23] uh really interesting about it and it's
[37:24] not the case for so many other things.
[37:27] Uh so the more it grows the better it is
[37:30] for anyone who owns any of it
[37:33] which that's the thing like so uh I
[37:37] don't have an opinion on Black Rockck
[37:40] but like the amount of money, effort,
[37:42] time they're putting in um is good for
[37:47] me on an individual level. Um, and one
[37:51] thing too that I think gets lost a
[37:53] little bit in the talk sometimes with
[37:56] like say ETFs and other things is that
[38:00] uh one of the ETFs wants you to be able
[38:03] to withdraw your Bitcoin um in kind
[38:07] which just means like uh they've applied
[38:10] so you can uh withdraw the actual
[38:12] Bitcoin from the ETF. And yes, I know
[38:16] that's not the case right now. I don't
[38:17] even think there's any ETF you can do
[38:19] that with. But again, game theory
[38:21] playing out, if one Bitcoin ETF offers
[38:25] that service, every other one will also
[38:28] have to offer that service in the
[38:29] future, otherwise they're going to get
[38:31] left behind. And yeah, I don't think the
[38:34] ETF is the best way to hold your
[38:36] Bitcoin, but I do believe in the future
[38:39] that for the ETFs
[38:42] um that you're going to be able to
[38:44] withdraw them in kind. I also think in
[38:47] the future uh once we have more clear
[38:50] laws and stuff, you're going to be able
[38:52] to get a Bitcoin dividend from certain
[38:55] companies. Uh so all of that is just
[38:58] going to increase adoption and they say
[39:01] like liquidity begets liquidity just so
[39:04] like the more of that there is uh it
[39:08] just continues to grow. So even though
[39:11] there's certain things I don't like, I
[39:13] can still see the positives and the
[39:15] future that like I want to see. So um
[39:20] like for the ETFs,
[39:22] uh like if I I actually don't hold any,
[39:24] but if I held any, I would be wanting my
[39:27] ETF to be able to have withdrawals in
[39:31] kind. Um and I think that's the way
[39:33] it'll end up playing out as the years go
[39:35] on. in in Europe they actually already
[39:38] have that uh the the Bitcoin ETPs that
[39:40] they are called not ETFs um that is
[39:43] existing since 200 I think 15 or
[39:46] something like that they actually offer
[39:48] in kind so I do think if if they if they
[39:51] are long enough there also all the
[39:53] American ones uh and Canadian and all
[39:56] the ETFs will have to offer in kind
[40:00] because it's the game theory because
[40:01] once one starts and then people prefer
[40:05] that one and to bring capital back to
[40:09] your own ETF, you have to also offer
[40:11] that feature. So, uh it's it's just a
[40:13] it's just Yeah, it's a game theory
[40:15] thing. Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome. I
[40:17] didn't know that. That's that's really
[40:19] good to hear. Yeah, they Well, yeah,
[40:21] exactly. Are you seeing like an increase
[40:23] then in like the ETFs in Europe offering
[40:26] like in kind withdrawals or do they just
[40:28] all have to have it now? I actually
[40:30] don't uh know because I'm uh myself I
[40:33] don't invest in ETFs at all and I'm not
[40:36] that interested in the European ETFs. I
[40:40] was interested in the American ETFs just
[40:43] because the volume is so much bigger. Uh
[40:47] and the amount of money they can extract
[40:51] from the fiat system to the Bitcoin
[40:53] system is just so much more. Uh I've
[40:56] I've I've seen uh last week uh the
[41:00] Bitcoin ETFs uh bought six times the
[41:04] amount uh of Bitcoin being mined this
[41:07] week. So it's a ma massive what they're
[41:10] buying. It's massive what they are kind
[41:12] of accumulating. Uh and this will just
[41:15] continue. ETFs. Now in America, they're
[41:17] in the second year. Now the second year
[41:20] will probably be a even bigger year and
[41:22] the third year will be even bigger year
[41:24] because those products live from how
[41:26] long they're already here and they also
[41:29] need some time to like get the big
[41:31] players in. So it's been already the
[41:33] best performing uh ETFs ever and uh it
[41:37] will continue to be uh like that and uh
[41:40] it will accelerate actually the adoption
[41:42] a lot.
[41:44] Yeah, it they they've been uh they've
[41:46] brought so much so many dollars into the
[41:49] market. That's for sure. And then from
[41:51] my understanding too, they a lot of the
[41:54] companies that are offering the ETFs,
[41:56] like yes, they're advertising a little
[41:58] bit more. Like they're making it known
[41:59] that they have it, but I don't think
[42:02] their advisers are even telling 100% of
[42:04] their clients to put one to 3% of their
[42:07] whole portfolio into it yet. I think
[42:10] that's going to happen. Um, but from my
[42:14] understanding that hasn't even happened
[42:15] yet. And I know at the beginning, uh,
[42:17] what I was being told was that they
[42:20] weren't,
[42:22] uh, even supposed to tell their clients
[42:25] about it at all. It was just if their
[42:28] clients asked about it. And so, uh, part
[42:31] of my background is I used to work in
[42:32] banking and wealth management. And the
[42:35] last wealth management place I worked at
[42:38] uh was a few years ago, but the Canadian
[42:40] ETF had been available since
[42:43] 2021. And we were looking at uh putting
[42:46] a client some of their funds into the
[42:49] Bitcoin
[42:50] ETF and it wasn't on our approved list.
[42:53] So, even though it was uh legal ETF in
[42:57] Canada, the company I was working for,
[43:00] like under their umbrella, the Bitcoin
[43:03] ETF wasn't on their approved list, so we
[43:05] actually couldn't put it in our client's
[43:07] account. Uh, so don't get me wrong, I
[43:10] don't know if that's still a thing with
[43:12] that company, but I guarantee you that
[43:14] there are for sure some companies like
[43:16] that. Um, and that would have been like
[43:18] two and a half years after the Canadian
[43:20] ETF launched. Whereas like in the US,
[43:24] what it's been like 14 months or
[43:26] something. So, uh, I bet not even 100%
[43:30] of them that like uh or advisers are
[43:33] even allowed to put it into their
[43:35] clients accounts even if they asked yet.
[43:38] Yeah, it's I think uh 17 months I think
[43:42] it's now because like one year and then
[43:43] and like five five months when this
[43:46] podcast will come out almost 6 months.
[43:48] Uh so we will will will be fun to see.
[43:52] Um, what I'm I'm so curious because you
[43:55] talk with so many different uh
[43:58] Bitcoiners um especially it it's
[44:01] different when you talk with Bitcoiners
[44:04] on Twitter and on podcast and stuff like
[44:06] that versus when you talk with you
[44:08] probably also go to like meetups a lot
[44:10] and and stuff like that. What what do
[44:12] you think is the best thing a Bitcoiner
[44:15] can do for Bitcoin? Yeah, that's a
[44:18] really good question. So, I think
[44:20] there's two things that are really
[44:22] important to do. And one is uh be
[44:25] patient with other people when you're
[44:27] educating them. And then actually use
[44:31] Bitcoin and make sure you're
[44:34] putting make sure you're using
[44:36] self-custody. Uh but I'll expand on
[44:38] those. Uh
[44:40] so I think every Bitcoiner has gotten
[44:44] frustrated with orange pilling people or
[44:46] you've got people to like
[44:49] the ninth inning, they're like, "I'm
[44:51] going to buy some. I'm going to buy
[44:52] some." You follow up a little bit later.
[44:54] They're like, "Oh, I didn't." Or, "Oh,
[44:56] not yet." And you just have to meet
[45:00] people where they are. Uh, one thing too
[45:03] is, uh, I was hoping we were actually
[45:04] going to talk about orange pilling a
[45:06] little bit because I was, what I found
[45:09] lately,
[45:10] um, with talking to people who aren't
[45:13] yet Bitcoiners, uh, I'm very fortunate
[45:16] about half of my friends have some
[45:19] exposure to Bitcoin. Uh, so it's really
[45:21] good. That's above the average, of
[45:23] course. Part of it is because I've been
[45:25] talking to them about it for so long.
[45:27] But what I've really found lately that
[45:29] works when I'm meeting them halfway is,
[45:33] you know, people keep bringing up the
[45:34] tariffs or how things are changing and
[45:38] etc, etc. But what I found really works
[45:42] is being like, yeah, that's one of the
[45:45] things I like about Bitcoin is it
[45:47] doesn't change and I know what the rules
[45:49] are. And for a couple people, it seems
[45:52] like that's kind of just clicked because
[45:54] they'll ask me follow-up questions, ask
[45:56] me more about it. U but that's kind of
[45:59] what I've been using lately. And then um
[46:03] like in previous times like when people
[46:05] are complaining about say like cost of
[46:07] living or stuff like that uh and you
[46:09] show them how you know prices have gone
[46:12] down when you're saving in Bitcoin uh as
[46:15] long as you know it's been over the
[46:16] right time period. Um
[46:20] just finding ways to meet people in the
[46:22] middle and educate them I think is the
[46:25] most important thing you can do and then
[46:27] just on a more personal level using
[46:30] Bitcoin being involved in the space more
[46:33] such as going to meetups and using
[46:35] self-custody. Uh my Bitcoin journey like
[46:39] almost started from when I went to my
[46:41] very first meetup. Like that that is the
[46:44] day I knew like I was like okay
[46:45] Bitcoin's a thing. I'm now a Maxi. I'm
[46:48] in a room with like 40 50 other people.
[46:51] Uh Samson Mao happened to be the
[46:53] speaker. Uh it was it was really good.
[46:55] like I I remember all of it and it just
[46:59] it clicked for me there seeing lightning
[47:02] working in person because
[47:06] the it's not like I had doubts I just
[47:09] when people kept telling me Bitcoin was
[47:12] old technology it was slow all that was
[47:14] always in the back of my mind and then I
[47:16] actually saw it working in person it
[47:18] like it flipped the switch for me and so
[47:21] that's another thing too like I've shown
[47:22] so many people how lightning works
[47:26] And uh that's one of the things too with
[47:27] Orange Pill app. They have a lightning
[47:30] wallet like within the app now, which is
[47:32] really good. So that's one of my go-tos
[47:35] with showing people how quick it is to
[47:37] send Bitcoin and I'll just type in like
[47:41] Africa or Europe or something. Someone
[47:43] will come up who's 6,000 miles away,
[47:46] 10,000 miles away and I send them
[47:49] lightning and it is in their wallet like
[47:53] that. And people are like, "So what?
[47:56] They can spend it?" I'm like, "Yeah."
[47:57] And they're like, "Well, is there places
[47:58] for them to spend it?" I'm like, "Okay."
[48:01] Yeah. I mean, maybe, maybe not. But
[48:03] like, as you know, like where we live,
[48:05] there's about 100 you can spend it at.
[48:08] And that is the duty I think of everyone
[48:11] to just help grow that circular economy
[48:14] where they are. So, I mean, I guess I
[48:17] gave like four things now, but
[48:21] I I like your uh first point of meet
[48:24] people where they are. It's a thing that
[48:27] I always see when we Bitcoiners come to
[48:31] someone that never has uh heard has
[48:34] heard about Bitcoin or has some notions
[48:36] about Bitcoin. What actually happens in
[48:38] that moment is you have let's say 60 70%
[48:42] uh understanding of bitcoin and I think
[48:44] 60 70% of understanding of bitcoin is
[48:47] already really high. I think nobody is
[48:49] close to like 90%. like nobody grasps
[48:52] Bitcoin that much, but like if you have
[48:54] like 60 70% of Bitcoin understanding,
[48:56] you're really
[48:57] good. And then you come to someone that
[49:01] is at
[49:02] 2%. 1% of Bitcoin understanding, maybe
[49:05] even like 0.1% of Bitcoin understanding.
[49:08] So you have to forget the things that
[49:11] you already know and you have to go to
[49:14] first principles and really go uh down
[49:18] there. And there are like two there's
[49:21] there are two interesting questions that
[49:23] you can ask to assess where someone is
[49:26] in his journey. The first question and
[49:28] this is my favorite question to ask uh
[49:30] someone uh that I want to orange pill is
[49:33] what is money for you? like that answer
[49:38] is is telling me a
[49:41] lot about that person and that knowledge
[49:45] uh that that he has uh about uh money,
[49:49] about gold, about Bitcoin, about
[49:52] currencies. And this is the first
[49:54] question. And then the second question
[49:57] is not a specific question that I always
[49:59] ask is is a specific one uh depending on
[50:02] what uh he says. Uh and it's just a
[50:06] question of like let's go deeper down
[50:09] the same question. If you said like oh
[50:11] uh I think money is the euro
[50:15] uh and and then you can ask something
[50:18] like what do you think uh would be the
[50:22] perfect money like if you go can do from
[50:26] scratch and design the perfect money. Uh
[50:30] and I did that with a lot of people.
[50:31] It's super interesting. first it's like
[50:33] really hard for them to come up with
[50:34] things but like you give them some idea
[50:36] and all of a sudden they they come up
[50:37] with things and I did that actually uh
[50:40] in on a university with a group of 20
[50:42] people and I just wrote down what they
[50:45] said and then I said okay let's let's
[50:47] try to get get things together so they
[50:50] said things like oh I want to have uh
[50:53] the same value in like 20 years from now
[50:56] oh I want to spend that money everywhere
[50:58] I can and stuff like that so they
[51:00] basically said like oh store of IO, unit
[51:02] of account, mean of exchange. So they
[51:04] mentioned all those things and then I
[51:08] usually go through them. Okay, what are
[51:09] your options that you can do? Uh euro
[51:12] for example, the fiat currencies,
[51:14] dollar, Canadian dollar, whatever it
[51:17] is. Does it really preserve your value
[51:20] over 20 years? If they say yes, you can
[51:23] prove them
[51:24] wrong. You you you can show them the
[51:27] facts. Then you can go on with those
[51:29] different values that you the properties
[51:31] of money that you have kind of figured
[51:33] out and then like let them know where
[51:37] they are in in the journey and and then
[51:39] you know exactly where to tackle the
[51:41] missing pieces to get them from 0.1%
[51:45] maybe to 5%. And also don't try to get
[51:48] them from 0.1% to 50% in like five
[51:53] evenings. those needs a lot of evenings
[51:56] to to to get there. Uh so sorry for my
[51:59] small rant. I just wanted to throw that
[52:01] out there because I think it's important
[52:02] for people to to understand the first
[52:05] point of like meet people where they are
[52:09] and don't overwhelm them with Bitcoin is
[52:12] going to like $200
[52:15] million because they they won't a
[52:18] believe you and they b have no no grasp
[52:22] of like why do we even think that? So
[52:24] they think that you're just a lunatic.
[52:26] The same thing if you say like oh
[52:28] bitcoin will replace all the fiat
[52:29] currencies uh bitcoin will royalty
[52:31] reserve currency. No like step back
[52:34] first principles what is money? So sorry
[52:36] for my small rant. No that's awesome. I
[52:40] I really like that. The part when you
[52:44] ask them um like give me the qualities
[52:47] characteristics of like your perfect
[52:49] money. Uh that seems really smart. Uh
[52:53] because that's one thing that I have had
[52:55] trouble with like talking to other
[52:57] people is I ask them why they if they're
[53:02] saving in Canadian dollars, you know,
[53:04] this is going to be worth less next
[53:07] year, but you don't know how much less
[53:10] it's going to be worth next year.
[53:13] And so many people are caught up in this
[53:17] belief that, well, that's the way it's
[53:20] always been. that's the way it's always
[53:22] going to be. And first off, it actually
[53:25] hasn't even really always been that way.
[53:28] Um, we've had deflation in the past 150
[53:31] years. Uh, like the US leaving the gold
[53:34] standard in 1971. Um, it seems like
[53:37] there was a big change to money since
[53:39] then. And but even those concepts like
[53:43] that's not meeting them where they are
[53:44] cuz usually they're not familiar with
[53:46] those things either. So, I like how
[53:48] you're saying, you know, design what you
[53:50] think is the best and then we can go
[53:52] over these different things.
[53:55] Um, do they bring up gold then sometimes
[53:58] when they're like talking about that?
[54:01] Gold always uh is is a thing that
[54:04] usually comes up. It's it's
[54:06] also they're different people. For
[54:08] example, my dad really got gold. He he
[54:11] told me when I was a 8-year-old kid and
[54:15] we were in Egypt for holiday. He told
[54:18] me, "Oh, the whole system is is is kind
[54:20] of bad and the depth system and everyone
[54:23] like he got why we need Bitcoin way
[54:27] before I even could go to the toilet."
[54:30] So like he got that way before. But I
[54:33] got the solution, Bitcoin. uh obviously
[54:36] yeah before him because I I orange peel
[54:39] him and the first time we talked a
[54:41] little bit about Bitcoin and and and
[54:43] what it is and stuff like that he uh
[54:46] full uh full credit to him he's always
[54:49] super open like I I can't believe he he
[54:52] works in sometimes very conservative
[54:55] industries with very conservative guys
[54:57] and and he's actually born it's it's a
[54:59] funny thing he's born in
[55:02] 1971 he's literally is his uh his year
[55:06] is is the birth year also of the US
[55:08] dollar. Uh the US dollar how we how we
[55:10] know it now. Uh so that's that that's
[55:13] funny. And he's kind of the guy uh that
[55:18] already knew about the problem and
[55:20] already knew about gold. He was a gold
[55:23] um uh fan. That's why, for example, uh
[55:26] when I did my school uh diploma, uh I
[55:30] got a small gold coin from him as a as a
[55:32] present, as a gift. I still have it for
[55:34] emotional value. Uh, and it's also fun
[55:37] to see how this small gold coin all of
[55:39] the sudden rises in value a lot. Um,
[55:42] this is like one type of guy and the
[55:45] other type of guy is like they don't
[55:47] even know about the
[55:49] problem where where where you have to
[55:51] start on a completely different side. So
[55:54] like they they don't even aware that we
[55:57] have some problem with with the with the
[56:00] fiat system. they just trust in
[56:02] institutions, they trust in bankers. And
[56:04] the previous episode actually was about
[56:06] that. He he was a banker and actually
[56:09] dealt with subprime uh uh products and
[56:13] he was actually um he was working for
[56:16] that calip guy uh in the big short it
[56:20] was um played by Ryan Gosling and he
[56:23] worked for this very guy and I talked
[56:26] with him uh and he's now a Bitcoiner.
[56:28] So, it's really really uh uh nice to see
[56:31] those people uh get it. I lost my my red
[56:35] line now. But anyways, uh there's like
[56:38] people that get the problem but not the
[56:43] solution, that's really great. Those
[56:44] people easy. People that don't even get
[56:47] the problem, that's harder because if
[56:49] they really think banks are great and we
[56:51] need inflation that you have to break a
[56:54] lot of glass there.
[56:57] Yeah. Yeah. I agree. And it sounds like
[57:00] your dad is similar to my parents. Uh so
[57:03] they always believed in like owning
[57:05] land. Uh I grew up on a dairy farm. Um
[57:08] but like owning land or also owning uh
[57:11] like essentially mining stock. So like
[57:13] gold, copper, silver, that kind of
[57:15] stuff. So they always believed in that.
[57:18] And then I orange peel them a little bit
[57:20] ago. And then the other day, uh, my dad
[57:25] calls me and he's like, "I should be
[57:27] daily cost averaging." And I'm like,
[57:29] "Yeah." Like, you know, we've talked
[57:30] about that for a while, but he goes,
[57:32] "Right now, like I don't want to put
[57:34] money in land. Um, like I have whatever
[57:38] in mining adjacent um, investments, but
[57:42] like normally it'd be like, okay, well,
[57:44] like you can't go wrong with land um,
[57:47] and stuff like that." And he's like, "I
[57:49] just I think I think Bitcoin's safer."
[57:51] And I'm like, yes, I completely agree.
[57:53] Like, I'm glad we're on the same page
[57:55] because, and I don't know if it's maybe
[57:57] the like I have been talking a lot about
[57:59] how the rules don't change lately, so I
[58:01] don't know if maybe it was that, but it
[58:03] was something that just clicked or he's
[58:05] just seeing like the
[58:08] um like the environment
[58:11] changing like regarding assets and it's
[58:14] like, okay, well, I know this isn't
[58:16] going to change. Um, and there's still a
[58:20] lot of potential catalysts like uh that
[58:22] are coming. Um,
[58:25] which I mean it'll be interesting to see
[58:27] what happens, but there are so many
[58:29] different catalysts and yeah, so I mean
[58:33] I just think once you get people off
[58:36] zero and they start to see the value go
[58:40] up, um, it'd be better if he was
[58:43] measuring in Bitcoin, but most people
[58:45] aren't. And uh but as they see like the
[58:49] value go up in fiat terms uh it does
[58:52] work for a lot of people that way. Uh
[58:55] that is one thing too that I like Jeff
[58:57] Booth uh when he was on your podcast
[58:59] recently like he was talking about
[59:01] that and like as someone who gets paid
[59:05] in Bitcoin. Uh I know so many other
[59:08] Bitcoiners wish they could get paid 100%
[59:11] or even partially in Bitcoin. Uh, so I
[59:14] feel very fortunate that I'm able to.
[59:16] Uh, but I was when I was selling a
[59:20] little bit for like expenses at the end
[59:22] of the month, I'm like telling the
[59:24] person like he's all happy like we're
[59:26] making this exchange and it's like yeah,
[59:28] I'm happy except like I'm not because
[59:30] I'm selling my
[59:32] Bitcoin. But like I've Yeah. So I've
[59:34] started to measure uh all my stuff like
[59:38] in terms of Bitcoin now. And it's it's
[59:42] been really like cool to be able to do
[59:44] that
[59:45] and not able to like 100% be Bitcoin
[59:49] only just because of like the way
[59:51] everything's set up. But I'm pretty much
[59:55] like avoiding banks for the most part,
[59:58] credit cards,
[60:00] um, and all of that
[60:02] because I'm able to just mostly transact
[60:06] in cash or in Bitcoin.
[60:09] Um, and there are like certain companies
[60:12] in Canada like where you can pay your
[60:15] bills online using Bitcoin. So like that
[60:17] is awesome as well. I re I tweeted that
[60:20] just yesterday. I I tweeted out the
[60:23] moment you stop obsessing about the
[60:26] short-term price volatility of Bitcoin
[60:29] is the moment where you find joy in
[60:31] life.
[60:33] because I see a lot of Bitcoiners, even
[60:37] friends of mine, uh, in the Bitcoin
[60:39] sphere that are still posting once we
[60:43] crack the 90K again and now we went down
[60:46] to 87K and and I'm like, why? I believe
[60:52] that Bitcoin is going to a million to 10
[60:54] million, then 100 million, and then to
[60:55] infinity because fiat will be replaced.
[60:59] If I'm secure about that belief and I
[61:02] really know
[61:04] that why would I look at the price like
[61:07] like why does the price the short-term
[61:10] price movements matter? Yeah. Okay. If
[61:13] you want to see okay I want to retire in
[61:15] 10 years maybe it's interesting to know
[61:19] where roughly we will be to plan for
[61:22] your retirement. I get that like I get
[61:24] that feedback also a lot. Um, but I'm
[61:27] young. I'm 25 like 26 already. Um, I
[61:32] have no absolutely no way of selling
[61:37] Bitcoin. I do spend Bitcoin. So, I have
[61:41] to also have a similar situation as you.
[61:43] I have I think like 70% of my income in
[61:46] Bitcoin and about 10 20% of my expenses
[61:50] in Bitcoin. So I have to exchange
[61:53] Bitcoin for fiat to sell fiat bills. But
[61:56] I don't call it selling. I call it
[61:59] spending just with the route of fiat. I
[62:02] know technically it's selling Bitcoin.
[62:04] I'm sorry, but but uh it's a really sen
[62:09] moment once you say I have Bitcoin 100%.
[62:14] I'm not in overdraft with like 105%
[62:17] Bitcoin. I also don't have fear laying
[62:19] around. So, I'm just 100% in Bitcoin. If
[62:22] I'm 110% in Bitcoin, 102% in Bitcoin, I
[62:26] will sell some Bitcoin, get more feared
[62:28] to be at zero again. If I have 97% of
[62:31] Bitcoin, I buy more Bitcoin with that
[62:33] fear that I have like like and and I do
[62:36] that now. And I I don't need any brain
[62:40] cells for finances. I just being 100% in
[62:43] Bitcoin and can focus
[62:46] 99.999% of my energy now on my life
[62:49] again. Now it happens to be that my life
[62:51] is about Bitcoin. So I have to care
[62:54] about finances again. But if my podcast
[62:57] would be about something else, that
[62:59] would be fine, too. Like uh like then
[63:01] then I don't care about Bitcoin at all.
[63:03] I probably don't even follow the price.
[63:04] I probably be like, "What? We already at
[63:06] 150k? I didn't know that." Because like
[63:09] why would I know? I only get to know the
[63:11] price because guests are telling me and
[63:14] my Twitter feed is telling me.
[63:16] Yeah, that's one thing I've noticed too.
[63:19] I mean, I never stress about the price
[63:21] or anything. Um, first bare market I
[63:24] went through like, yeah, maybe I looked
[63:26] at it a little bit more then, but I was
[63:28] just thinking like, oh, this is such a
[63:30] good buying opportunity. Uh, so I it
[63:34] doesn't really bother me. and then like
[63:37] getting paid on a monthly basis like I'm
[63:39] not even necessarily hoping the price is
[63:41] high at the end of the month because
[63:43] it's like oh that's the day I get paid.
[63:45] Uh, so yeah, I I will I'll get updates
[63:51] from friends and it's it's one of those
[63:55] things
[63:56] where I'm happy that they're like
[63:59] keeping an eye on things and like uh are
[64:02] happy when the price goes up and
[64:04] everything, but it just it really
[64:06] doesn't matter over the long term. Um,
[64:09] especially like the people I'm getting
[64:10] updates from, like they're all buying on
[64:13] a monthly basis. Like it's it's a little
[64:16] bittersweet, you know? Um, going to
[64:19] continue to buy the top, going to
[64:20] continue to buy the
[64:22] bottom. It's just is going to average
[64:24] out o over the rest of our lives. Um,
[64:28] but yeah, like I just I don't really see
[64:30] a I agree with you where it's like it
[64:33] doesn't doesn't make too much of a
[64:34] difference. It's definitely less
[64:36] stressful not looking at it. If I get a
[64:39] text from someone and they're like, "Oh,
[64:41] the price is down 5% or it's up
[64:43] 5%." That doesn't make any difference in
[64:46] my everyday life. Like either way. So,
[64:50] um yeah, it does. It just it doesn't
[64:52] make any difference to me. But, uh
[64:55] anytime I get a text about Bitcoin, I'm
[64:58] always happy about it.
[65:00] Yeah, it's it's great to see that people
[65:02] get interested in even if we are
[65:05] disappointed with the question they're
[65:07] asking.
[65:08] Yeah. But we have to be humble and we
[65:11] have to acknowledge that they are at
[65:13] 0.1% and not at uh 80 60% or something
[65:17] like that. Um as you know I have one
[65:19] question that I asked each and every one
[65:21] of my guests and the question is what
[65:22] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin?
[65:24] Yeah. Okay. Uh great question. Yeah. So
[65:28] besides Bitcoin, uh my life does really
[65:31] revolve around it now. Uh so I'm very
[65:34] fortunate to be able to like pretty much
[65:36] live it 24/7.
[65:38] Uh, but besides Bitcoin,
[65:42] like I really
[65:44] do like getting out and seeing, you
[65:49] know, friends and family and just like
[65:53] doing anything um with them and just
[65:56] seeing like how like how our lives are
[66:01] different in certain senses, but really
[66:04] it's all the same. And sometimes I think
[66:07] people forget that we need to have that
[66:11] connection still uh with friends, family
[66:16] um and seeing people offline. Um and
[66:19] that's one really good thing with both
[66:21] Vexhole and Orange Pill App is I mean I
[66:26] guess it's kind of still Bitcoiny but
[66:28] like meeting up with Bitcoiners in real
[66:31] life as well. Um, but also still putting
[66:34] a priority on like my friends who may or
[66:37] may not be Bitcoiners and family. Like
[66:40] that's what it's really all about. Uh,
[66:43] so yes, Bitcoin is making the world a
[66:47] better place, but I want to share that
[66:50] with people I care about.
[66:52] Yeah, I I completely stopped uh texting
[66:56] friends. I when I want to hang out with
[66:59] them, I'm calling them and then we're
[67:01] hanging out in person in real life and
[67:04] doing something physically together. And
[67:08] that's that's I think the the the way to
[67:10] do it. Um I'm I'm a really bad
[67:14] taxer. Like I um I text a lot with
[67:17] Bitcoiners because of guests and
[67:19] invitations and stuff like that that
[67:20] like business stuff. Um but if you look
[67:23] at my WhatsApp, it's it's almost seems
[67:25] like I have no friends at all. I'm not
[67:27] texting any any
[67:28] anyone because I'm calling them. So I I
[67:30] I I do like that that message of yours a
[67:33] lot. Go out uh and touch some crass with
[67:37] with your friends in physical proximity
[67:40] uh to each other and uh uh not just uh
[67:43] online texting how are you like I I
[67:47] never get the people that text how are
[67:48] you like like what the If you
[67:51] really want to know how how am I then
[67:53] call at least. Yeah. Yeah.
[67:58] It would be so weird if someone asks you
[68:00] like, "Oh, how are you?" And all of the
[68:02] sudden you like a long text of your life
[68:04] story.
[68:07] Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Absolutely. Um,
[68:09] as as you know, we have the end routine
[68:11] where the previous guest is asking a
[68:12] question for the next guest without
[68:14] knowing who the next guest actually is.
[68:16] And the the previous guest asked you the
[68:18] question, how high are the chances that
[68:21] we will have a bitcoin only world with
[68:24] no other fiat currency in 25 years? That
[68:28] is a good question. 25 years. Uh so I
[68:34] mean it's gradually then suddenly
[68:37] but I think there will
[68:39] be I I would say the chances in 25 years
[68:43] are 10%. Um I think it will take a
[68:47] little bit longer. Um
[68:50] I like as a Bitcoin maxi like I don't
[68:54] like saying I think it's okay for there
[68:57] to be like parallel economies. Um but in
[69:02] 25 years I could see there
[69:03] being Bitcoin say one type of
[69:08] currency and
[69:11] um gold will still have value in that
[69:14] time period. I think uh but yeah
[69:18] the and I don't know if that's a bad
[69:21] thing. I think because of game theory
[69:23] like Bitcoin will win out and it'll
[69:24] swallow 99% of economic value. Um, but
[69:30] I think it will take longer than that. I
[69:33] think
[69:35] probably like like more
[69:37] like 30 to 50. Um, I think 25 is still
[69:41] just slightly early. Um, very happy to
[69:44] be proven wrong though. So, I'm totally
[69:46] okay if that happens. I I think it's
[69:50] actually good if it it is slow. I always
[69:53] make that Titanic example. Uh, fear is a
[69:56] Titanic. a lot of people are still on
[69:57] there. We need to get people across to
[70:00] the savings boats to the to the boat
[70:03] where it's it's safe to be. And uh if it
[70:06] if if Fiat is in the Titanic is sinking
[70:10] too fast, people will drown and and
[70:12] that's not a good thing. Um yeah, thank
[70:14] you so much, Michael, for for for being
[70:16] on the on the podcast. Um before I let
[70:18] you go, where can people find you and
[70:19] ask you questions and reach out to you?

[70:24] best way to find me is on
[70:27] Twitter_Mike Degrroot. And then yeah,
[70:31] any any way you can support the circular
[70:35] economy, I highly encourage that. And if
[70:38] you're not already attending meetups, go
[70:40] find the closest meetup to you. Um,
[70:43] yeah, and uh, I hope to meet some more
[70:46] people that listen to this today. And
