[00:00] that $10 million per Bitcoin number is
[00:02] in today's dollars there's a greater
[00:04] likelihood for this cycle to be bigger
[00:06] than the prior cycle I've been expecting
[00:08] 150 to 250 but I wouldn't be surprised
[00:12] if we go to 350 Bitcoin grows from being
[00:14] 1 1,000 of the world's assets to 20% of
[00:18] the world's assets which is a 200x gain
[00:21] in relative to other asset that removes
[00:24] the dollar measuring stick issue and
[00:26] says that that's real growth of 200x as
[00:29] people learn more about the asset people
[00:31] are shifting from a speculating stance
[00:34] with Bitcoin to a I'm going to put this
[00:36] in cold storage and hold it for
[00:38] Generations because it's so
[00:40] [Music]
[00:43] valuable uh we we talked about it before
[00:46] we had sailor on the show and he talked
[00:48] about the 10 million uh dollar case and
[00:50] we have talked about that you are
[00:52] basically behind those numbers I mean he
[00:54] is also like when when he's putting the
[00:56] slides up he always like has your
[00:58] Twitter handle and everything like that
[01:00] uh so there's no no secret about that
[01:03] but before we get into the the full
[01:05] potential of Bitcoin and where we go I
[01:07] found also an article of you before the
[01:09] cycle started where you basically said
[01:12] this cycle will be different this cycle
[01:14] will be bigger because the uh basically
[01:17] the before cycle was a little bit
[01:18] dampened and now that this cycle you
[01:21] expect a little bit uh more do you still
[01:23] believe that and what do you mean with
[01:26] with
[01:27] bigger yeah good good topic interesting
[01:31] to revisit that um yeah that was about a
[01:33] year ago and and I I I I I will say it's
[01:38] I specifically said I think uh it's
[01:40] there's a greater likelihood for this
[01:42] cycle to be bigger than the prior cycle
[01:45] than than we've had in any earlier um
[01:49] cycle so I basically and and and then I
[01:53] dug into the analysis of uh I I think
[01:55] that you know last cycle was muted for
[01:59] of variety of reasons I think we would
[02:02] have gotten a blowoff top to the you
[02:05] know1 to $150,000 per Bitcoin range but
[02:09] but we didn't for several reasons one
[02:12] being the China mining band kind of
[02:14] throwing a wrench in the in the
[02:17] development of that um exponential
[02:21] blowoff top um you know in 2021 that
[02:24] caused the summer dip that we then had
[02:25] to like rebound from um the other big
[02:29] thing being the FTX um and other
[02:34] rehypothecation blowing up that that
[02:37] actually creates a little bit of uh
[02:39] positive
[02:41] um momentum on the on you know on the
[02:44] front side of those blowing up however
[02:46] they were using FTX in particular was
[02:49] using Bitcoin that uh its customers
[02:52] thought they were buying and holding and
[02:56] secretly selling that Bitcoin to buy
[02:58] altcoins that they were trying to prop
[03:00] up and and speculate on so that was
[03:02] actually um bearish for that was that
[03:06] was hurting the Bitcoin price because
[03:08] they were selling Bitcoin even though
[03:10] the customers thought that you know that
[03:12] they were still holding Bitcoin and
[03:13] that's what it was showing in their
[03:14] accounts so that was another thing but
[03:17] then probably the biggest one was the
[03:19] the FED switching from
[03:22] um from our low low interest rate
[03:25] environment to suddenly starting to hike
[03:27] interest rates um and that was kind of
[03:30] like a you know a cold a cold wind
[03:33] suddenly turning on uh for all markets
[03:35] but most of all for crypto um just kind
[03:38] of killing the speculative momentum that
[03:42] was developing at that point in time so
[03:45] all that to say that you know I think we
[03:46] didn't go as high as we would have um
[03:49] had th either any of those three things
[03:51] not happened um as a result of that I
[03:55] think that we are a bit of a compressed
[03:58] spring right now where there's we
[04:01] probably should have gone higher than we
[04:03] did um
[04:06] and the market thinks that the fair
[04:10] value of Bitcoin at this point in time
[04:12] is is lower than the actual fundamentals
[04:15] I think Will Will
[04:17] Reveal um because you know the the
[04:21] market sort of gets in this natural um
[04:23] tendency to say okay here was the top
[04:26] now what what's a 75% draw down for
[04:28] Bitcoin from there okay this is kind of
[04:30] the range that we should be in somewhere
[04:32] in the middle of right but if the top is
[04:34] 70k that the middle of that range is 35
[04:38] or 40 or something like that um but if
[04:40] the top was 150k the middle of the range
[04:43] is is 70k or you know something like
[04:46] that um and so in some ways I think
[04:49] that's kind of what happened uh first
[04:51] quarter of this year is Bitcoin was
[04:54] unusually low um you know we probably it
[04:57] it was it was uh un ual for us to go
[05:01] below the prior um the prior cycle High
[05:05] you know so when we when the FTX crash
[05:07] took us down to 15 16,000 that was below
[05:10] the 20,000 from the December 2017 Peak
[05:14] that had never happened before and I
[05:15] think that's part of the sort of
[05:18] suppression of of Bitcoin that was a was
[05:22] Downstream of those three things
[05:23] happening um in the 2021 bull market
[05:28] anyway as as a result of that I think we
[05:29] are lower than we than we um quote
[05:33] unquote should be and you can make the
[05:37] case then that that as this bull market
[05:39] plays out there will be just a bit more
[05:42] Tailwind um because the fundamentals
[05:46] will kind of bear out and will end up
[05:48] going higher and sort of making up some
[05:51] of the ground that we should have gotten
[05:53] four four years ago um and that's I
[05:57] could see that playing out it's sort of
[05:59] like a 35
[06:01] 45% chance you know which which is to
[06:04] say that I don't think it's my base case
[06:07] but I think it's um I think there's a
[06:10] good argument that that's what we'll see
[06:12] that is interesting I mean uh the the
[06:15] shorter term the the hard gets to
[06:17] predict any prices yeah uh and I heard
[06:21] anything from like 100k to a million I
[06:24] think like under 100K will be hard for
[06:27] for for the top of of of Bitcoin to be
[06:30] and over a million will be also really
[06:33] hard to be um where do you see like if
[06:36] you had to put a guess in uh in some
[06:39] range for for for next year where would
[06:42] you do
[06:43] it yeah great question
[06:46] um it it's really interesting right now
[06:49] because it it it's easier it's frankly
[06:52] easier to make predictions a year ago
[06:54] than it is now
[06:56] because as we start the closer we get to
[06:59] the actual
[07:00] posst having bull market uh you know
[07:05] manifesting
[07:06] um the harder it gets to say what's
[07:11] going to happen because you know when
[07:12] you further out you can you can speak in
[07:14] generalities a little bit more easily um
[07:17] and then you know the closer you get the
[07:18] more Precision people expect but like we
[07:21] still don't really have any greater
[07:24] um uh ability to forecast the near term
[07:27] then you know that's always the case in
[07:29] Bitcoin
[07:30] um so so I I've sort of been expecting
[07:33] like a 150 to 250 and that's been my
[07:37] expectation for the last few years um
[07:41] for the for this Market cycle now I
[07:43] don't know if that'll be 12 months post
[07:45] having or 18 months post having I think
[07:48] somewhere in that range
[07:50] um last bull market
[07:53] we we got the uh enthusiasm Peak for the
[07:58] cycle uh 11 months post having actually
[08:02] um so you know we had the having in
[08:03] Spring 2020 and then we actually had our
[08:06] our Peak Mania um in in Spring 2021
[08:11] right before the China mining band cut
[08:13] it short so you kind of don't know what
[08:15] would have happened or how long that
[08:16] Mania would have extended but you know
[08:19] as it as it played out we we had 11
[08:22] months from having to Peak enthusiasm of
[08:25] course we ended up in
[08:27] November uh I think November maybe late
[08:29] October setting a a slightly higher high
[08:32] but there was not as much like new
[08:34] interest um from people who you know
[08:37] weren't in
[08:39] crypto um so I anyway I don't know if if
[08:44] we'll have a peak 12 months post having
[08:46] which would be
[08:49] Q2 this next year or 18 months post
[08:52] having which would be the end of the
[08:53] year which is what we we have have had
[08:57] in most Cycles but not really in last
[09:00] cycle um yeah and so 150 to 250 however
[09:06] the the I wasn't really expecting the
[09:08] ETFs to to happen um you know like a
[09:12] year ago
[09:14] I well a year ago it started to be the
[09:17] hints were there as as some of the SEC
[09:19] guidance started to make that evident
[09:22] that they were playing ball um but
[09:25] before that it it has always always felt
[09:27] like that would never happen then the
[09:29] ETFs did arrive and um I think we saw in
[09:33] in
[09:34] q1 um what that looks like what that
[09:38] does because there was a lot of
[09:40] excitement um a lot of inflows via the
[09:42] ETFs inflows much greater than the um
[09:45] daily Bitcoin issuance from mining you
[09:48] know some trading days we were seeing
[09:51] ETF demand uh that was 10x the current
[09:55] block ISS Bitcoin issuance from mining
[09:58] um which is
[10:00] incredible from a supply demand point of
[10:02] view and whenever we have those kind of
[10:04] conditions we're the the price is going
[10:07] to just rip um so it it's now an open
[10:11] question of will will that kind of ETF
[10:14] frenzy return um once the price of
[10:16] Bitcoin starts to run and I think the
[10:18] answer is yes it will I think I think
[10:21] the ETF buyers are like anybody in
[10:24] Bitcoin uh they respond to reflexivity
[10:27] when the price is running there's more
[10:29] demand um because people take interest
[10:32] and and Pile in so I think we're
[10:34] probably going to see that again and if
[10:36] we do we could see you know 300 350 so
[10:40] you know we'll see what how it plays out
[10:42] but I'm I'm still sort of anchoring to
[10:45] like 150 maybe
[10:47] 250 um but I wouldn't be surprised if we
[10:51] go to
[10:52] 350 um if the ETFs run really hot and
[10:57] everything gets really really exciting
[11:00] uh I don't I don't think it could
[11:02] possibly go higher than that this cycle
[11:04] so you know that the 1 million
[11:06] expectations that people are putting out
[11:07] there I think I think there are simply
[11:09] too many OG Bitcoin whales who would be
[11:12] more than happy to offload a ton of SATs
[11:16] at 500k you
[11:18] know yeah I think the sale pressure gets
[11:21] just like too high if we cross like a
[11:24] half a million or something like that in
[11:26] like next year it would be crazy uh even
[11:28] for non ogs that maybe have been
[11:31] entering in like 2021 like or in 2020
[11:34] that's not that far away like like four
[11:36] years next year is like five years so
[11:39] imagine in 2020 you could pick up like a
[11:41] Bitcoin for 3,000 then five years later
[11:44] it's a million that would be that would
[11:45] be really crazy and would give a lot of
[11:47] incentives to to put in sell pressure
[11:50] even with 300,000 but like with a
[11:52] million it's it's way more crazy on that
[11:55] completely agree that that's a great way
[11:57] to think about it like all those coins
[11:58] that bought
[11:59] 3K would it would be foolish not to at
[12:04] least sell half your stack you know if
[12:06] if you're just like a casual Bitcoin
[12:08] Speculator who it's like well look at
[12:10] this I I just I just made a A 100x plus
[12:15] in a few years I'm going to cash out
[12:17] some of it absolutely it's also
[12:20] interesting um two things that I want to
[12:22] highlight you said the first thing
[12:23] already the ETFs uh that came in January
[12:26] so like right before the the this this
[12:28] new cycle starts and also we hit the
[12:30] alltime high before uh the the the
[12:34] Haring which uh I think never happened
[12:37] before yeah that's right uh which is uh
[12:40] really interesting maybe also as you
[12:42] said because the previous cycle was kind
[12:45] of dampened uh so that that's like two
[12:48] two interesting points that I looking
[12:50] like oh it's it's like maybe this this
[12:52] next cycle is different but I guess
[12:54] every Cy like before every cycle there
[12:56] always this rumors like oh is this cycle
[12:58] different will we now a Gold Rush era or
[13:02] is the cycle thing breaking is that
[13:04] something that you're looking at like
[13:05] this this cycle is a psychology like so
[13:08] ingrained in us that it will never break
[13:11] because like from uh new mining Supply
[13:15] uh stands like the cycle gets less and
[13:18] less important I guess uh but will it
[13:21] break it at some point or will it break
[13:23] like to the upside downside what do you
[13:25] expect
[13:26] here yeah that's a that's a big question
[13:29] um um yeah I do think about this a lot
[13:30] and I don't I don't really have like I
[13:33] don't feel feel like I have that one
[13:34] figured out I think we'll all kind of
[13:37] find out together um I do think that
[13:41] there is I think there's a misconception
[13:44] about the impact of the having because
[13:47] it is true that the impact of the having
[13:49] gets less and less relative to the
[13:51] existing circulating
[13:53] Supply um and so then I think people see
[13:57] that and they go well the having not
[13:59] going to matter um
[14:01] eventually but if you think about it
[14:03] from the from the net inflows point of
[14:06] view so thinking about it from what
[14:08] dollars have to flow into Bitcoin to um
[14:12] well let's work through the numbers
[14:15] so right before the having uh the price
[14:19] was at
[14:20] 70k uh we had been mining um $1.8
[14:24] billion of new Bitcoin per month every
[14:27] single month $1.8 billion of new Bitcoin
[14:30] just appearing uh and that for the price
[14:32] of a Bitcoin to go sideways you need
[14:35] $1.8 billion of net inflowing capital
[14:40] coming in to absorb that that's that's
[14:42] so that's the definition of the price
[14:44] going sideways right all else equal
[14:46] holders not not
[14:48] selling that's that's what you
[14:51] need and that's what we were seeing uh
[14:54] right around the having so you know we
[14:57] have to assume you know all us equal
[14:59] that there was roughly $1.8 billion of
[15:02] of net inflowing capital then the having
[15:05] happens and suddenly we're mining half
[15:08] as much Bitcoin and so that 1.8 billion
[15:11] per month drops to 900 million per month
[15:15] and suddenly you only need $900 million
[15:18] of of net inflowing and capital every
[15:20] month in order for the the price of
[15:22] Bitcoin to go sideways at
[15:25] 70k but you're ostensibly not going to
[15:30] um that's you know there's no reason for
[15:32] the net inflowing capital to also drop
[15:35] when the having happens so ostensibly
[15:37] you'd have $1.8 billion doar of of net
[15:40] inflowing and capital coming in only 900
[15:43] million of new Bitcoin being created so
[15:46] now there's a $900 million gap and I
[15:50] think that is the that's the core
[15:52] mechanic of what causes the post having
[15:56] um Bitcoin Bitcoin bull markets is that
[15:59] $900
[16:00] million accumulating month after month
[16:04] after month after month and you
[16:06] basically the the people coming into the
[16:07] market have to go find more Supply
[16:10] because there's not enough being created
[16:12] for mining for them so they go bid you
[16:15] know they take they take it up from
[16:16] available for sale Supply um on
[16:19] exchanges and they put in cold storage
[16:20] and and that chips that chips away that
[16:22] eats through available for sale Supply
[16:25] until suddenly there's not much that
[16:28] people are willing to sell
[16:29] and then the price starts to it has to
[16:32] go up as biders try to find more Supply
[16:34] they have to raise their bids and you
[16:37] start to see this um slow parabolic
[16:40] Advance develop so that's the like the
[16:42] the net inflows perspective on the
[16:45] having and what's interesting about that
[16:47] is that that is always true so you know
[16:50] if the if the price of Bitcoin was to
[16:54] 10x um
[16:56] and you know so let's say
[16:59] yeah price of Bitcoin 10x is we and then
[17:01] we we are going into the next having I
[17:05] don't expect this these numbers but it's
[17:07] easier this way
[17:10] um at now we're doing n billion we're
[17:14] we're mining $9 billion per month and
[17:17] Bitcoin has has grown as an asset and
[17:20] there's more demand for it and that $9
[17:22] billion is offset by in net inflowing
[17:25] demand so the price is going sideways
[17:27] going into the next having and then the
[17:29] having happens and suddenly there's $4.5
[17:31] billion of of Bitcoin being created but
[17:36] still $9 billion of net inflowing demand
[17:39] that that four $4.5 billion of of Gap is
[17:44] what is going to generate the supply
[17:48] shortage um that accumulates that causes
[17:51] that that posst having Bitcoin bull
[17:54] market so from the perspective of of net
[17:57] inflows
[17:59] the the
[18:01] diminishing size of the of the having's
[18:04] impact um doesn't
[18:06] matter so long as the the the mechanics
[18:11] there are still happening and the dollar
[18:14] the dollar gap between between Bitcoin
[18:18] mining and net influence Supply
[18:21] continues to chip away at available for
[18:22] sales Supply granted there one other big
[18:25] assumption in there is
[18:26] that um you I guess you need to have
[18:29] available for sale Supply shrinking over
[18:32] time um in order for those mechanics
[18:36] to continue to cause like an acute
[18:39] shortage as the they chip away at
[18:42] available for sale Supply so like you
[18:44] know if you always had 10% of Bitcoin
[18:46] available for sale um it would be hard
[18:48] for posst having um Supply shortage to
[18:53] accumulate enough to cause like an acute
[18:57] uh price run um you know as the size of
[19:03] that impact gets smaller over you know
[19:07] 2x smaller every every having um but I
[19:10] think that I think that that that will
[19:12] not happen because I think as people
[19:15] learn more about the asset um people are
[19:19] shifting from a from a speculating sort
[19:23] of stance with Bitcoin to a I'm going to
[19:27] put this in cold storage and hold it for
[19:29] Generations because it's so valuable and
[19:32] and you know I think we're we're seeing
[19:34] like a shift on that and I think we're
[19:35] seeing that on chain too the I think
[19:38] right now the amount of Bitcoin that
[19:39] hasn't moved in over a year is is um at
[19:43] an all-time high so I think that Trend
[19:45] continues and that's part of the story
[19:46] here sorry that was a went I went in
[19:50] quite a Meandering uh route there but uh
[19:53] but hopefully that was interesting and
[19:56] that was interesting it's really um
[19:58] because I never looked at that with with
[20:00] the new inflows and then seeing what the
[20:03] Bitcoin prices and then we have to match
[20:04] that I mean there's also like a lot of
[20:07] other factors that come into play here
[20:08] but it's it's really interesting to look
[20:10] at uh it in that way now let's go um a
[20:14] little bit deeper in the full potential
[20:16] because it's it's it's fun to talk about
[20:18] short term uh
[20:21] but most bitcoiners that watch my
[20:24] podcast on a very regular basis they
[20:27] probably won't sell anyways the next
[20:29] like five 10 years uh so uh it's always
[20:32] fun for me to talk about where is
[20:34] Bitcoin going in like 10 20 30 50 years
[20:38] uh depending on what your outlook is
[20:39] like obviously mine is very far out
[20:41] because I'm 25 so I I would love a
[20:44] Bitcoin to be back at like 15K
[20:47] honestly the cheaper it gets the better
[20:50] it for me um I need the Bitcoin price to
[20:53] be high in like 20 30 years and not like
[20:56] tomorrow um so uh that that's what what
[20:59] what my perspective on that is so what
[21:02] is the the the full uh
[21:05] and it's always really interesting this
[21:08] question because the full potential we
[21:09] always have to Value it in in something
[21:12] uh and when you value it in dollars we
[21:14] have have to assume like we value it in
[21:16] today's taller derms so if we have like
[21:19] inflation or like a hyperinflation
[21:21] scenario in the like next like 20 50
[21:23] years which could happen um then like
[21:27] obviously those numbers are completely
[21:29] off and like oh in 2024 someone
[21:31] predicted a $10 million Bitcoin now it's
[21:34] like oh dollar is not there anymore so
[21:36] yeah uh that that's always interesting
[21:38] to see uh so I'm first interested in the
[21:41] full potential of Bitcoin in in dollar
[21:44] terms but then also maybe diving into
[21:47] comparison to maybe gold like how much
[21:51] kilograms of gold can you buy with one
[21:52] Bitcoin what's the average home price in
[21:55] Bitcoin in like 20 30 years because
[21:57] that's like really able Goods that will
[21:59] not go away dollar can go away but right
[22:03] now the unit of account is dollar so I
[22:05] think it's fair to to take dollar as as
[22:07] like a measurement tool because most
[22:09] people use it as that so you put out 10
[22:12] million um how do you get there and it's
[22:15] is still is this still the case one year
[22:17] later with the
[22:19] inflation yeah um yeah great great set
[22:22] up there that uh yeah that that that
[22:25] question that you have is was sort of
[22:27] the starting point for me for for doing
[22:29] this uh bitcoin's full potential
[22:31] valuation um analysis and article that
[22:35] that made a bit of a splash um you know
[22:38] as you alluded to earlier Michael
[22:40] sailor's uh Michael sailor loved it uh
[22:42] and has been using the the numbers from
[22:46] it the the graph and and then the
[22:48] framework too as part of his recent
[22:50] analysis over last year it's kind of you
[22:52] if you've seen a Michael sailor
[22:54] presentation the last year you've seen
[22:56] um parts of this analysis
[22:59] um so for me I guess a little bit
[23:02] background I I was a Management
[23:04] Consultant before getting into Bitcoin
[23:07] um
[23:09] and one analytical tool or exercise that
[23:13] you use and as a as a Management
[23:15] Consultant is uh the full potential of X
[23:20] um and it's usually in terms of like
[23:23] what if our client you know a big
[23:26] company was to start selling in Asia you
[23:31] know what's the full potential of market
[23:34] share we could get and profits we could
[23:36] get from that that's usually
[23:38] the the scope and and nature of of how
[23:42] this exercise is done so I'm so I'm
[23:44] familiar with doing that and and it
[23:45] involves you know pulling together
[23:47] various pieces to triangulate a a
[23:52] realistic um set of assumptions of what
[23:56] could happen or you know what's the
[23:57] start what's the starting point and then
[23:59] what could happen over time based on
[24:01] various assumptions that you know you
[24:03] kind of pressure test and it makes you
[24:06] ball park it and and you get a rough
[24:08] idea of of how things could go so with
[24:11] Bitcoin I that's been part of how I've
[24:13] thought about it from the start and a
[24:15] big part
[24:17] of um why I did this analysis was was
[24:21] because I realized that you know I like
[24:24] you I've recognized that the the dollar
[24:27] measuring stick doesn't make sense
[24:29] you know as you project forward into
[24:31] time so it doesn't really make any sense
[24:33] to say that the price of Bitcoin will be
[24:35] a million dollar or even $10
[24:37] million um in the future because who
[24:40] knows what a dollar is worth um so the
[24:44] thing that I wanted to do and and I
[24:46] think this is probably the the the bit
[24:50] of innovation I guess that I brought to
[24:54] um this analysis was to level set
[24:58] everything in terms of percent of the
[25:01] existing Assets in the world so that way
[25:03] you can you know it doesn't matter what
[25:05] a dollar is worth you're you're basing
[25:06] it based off of what's bitcoin's
[25:09] percent uh value in the AM among the
[25:14] total asset value in the world um and
[25:18] and that's more informative
[25:21] so the the starting point of that is to
[25:23] figure out well how many assets are
[25:24] there in the world uh and and funny
[25:27] enough that that was hard that was kind
[25:29] of the the thing that was missing that I
[25:32] had to you know do some some analysis to
[25:36] figure out what are the various buckets
[25:38] and how do I triangulate the right size
[25:41] for these buckets to say how much value
[25:43] sits in in bonds how much value sits in
[25:46] real estate how many how how much Fiat
[25:49] money is there how much value is in
[25:51] global equities markets that's that's
[25:53] stock markets but also private
[25:56] Equity um and Collectibles there's
[25:59] there's cars and other vehicles there's
[26:02] uh there's gold um and and then there's
[26:05] Bitcoin I did uh I did ignore uh
[26:08] derivatives because I think the uh
[26:11] nominal value of der derivatives is
[26:13] quadrillions but the settled settled
[26:16] value of derivatives is um I think a few
[26:20] hundred billion so that's a red herring
[26:22] that people fall for but anyway the when
[26:26] you sum up all the the Global asset
[26:29] value the numbers that I was Finding
[26:30] triangulating getting I think good
[26:33] estimates for $900 trillion of global
[26:35] asset value uh and that that was a year
[26:38] ago
[26:40] so I haven't updated the analysis we're
[26:43] probably close to quadrillion now again
[26:46] these numbers are are they are rough
[26:48] like I could be I could be 30 40% off
[26:52] with any particular bucket but I think
[26:54] in aggregate they're probably they
[26:56] probably are roughly right
[26:59] um anyway so in that context 900
[27:02] trillion Bitcoin is currently 1 trillion
[27:07] and so that is 1 1,000th
[27:10] roughly of all the asset value in the
[27:13] world so
[27:15] 0.1% of the to of the global asset value
[27:19] has migrated to bitcoin at this point in
[27:22] time and then and then the question from
[27:25] that point is what's the full potential
[27:28] for how much Global asset value could
[27:32] migrate to bitcoin or would be
[27:33] interested to migrate to bitcoin over
[27:37] time how much could Bitcoin eat from the
[27:40] global asset landscape and and that's
[27:42] anybody's uh anybody's bet but now you
[27:44] have the right question I think um
[27:48] because it doesn't matter in dollar
[27:49] terms really what you're talking about
[27:51] what matters is how you know what
[27:53] percentage of of global assets does
[27:55] Bitcoin
[27:56] become and
[27:59] I think that you know so so from that
[28:01] point it's kind
[28:03] of necessary to stay conservative um in
[28:06] in the numbers that I put out but
[28:08] basically I went through each of those
[28:10] um asset buckets and estimated a
[28:13] percentage of the capital sitting in
[28:16] those buckets today that I think would
[28:18] be interested in being held in Bitcoin
[28:20] instead because of all Bitcoins uh
[28:24] benefits advantages as a store value
[28:26] Asset most notably that the fact that it
[28:29] has increasing scarcity terminating and
[28:31] absolute scarcity and no other asset
[28:32] class has that so it's a better store
[28:34] value from that point of view um but
[28:37] also you know that you have no um no
[28:41] holding costs like you know if you're if
[28:43] you're a a landlord your real estate is
[28:46] a pain in the ass to maintain and and
[28:49] manage and you have all these headaches
[28:51] that go with that or or you could take
[28:53] that money that's sitting in your
[28:56] incremental um rental unit units and
[29:00] move it into Bitcoin and have no
[29:02] headaches holding that asset and you're
[29:05] going to get a better return also
[29:06] because because of increasing scarcity
[29:09] and the fact that it nobody for the most
[29:11] part most of the world doesn't
[29:13] understand yet what it is you know I
[29:15] think we're going to get 25 to
[29:17] 50% um annualized growth and good luck
[29:21] getting that in any other asset so it's
[29:23] it's literally a better asset than
[29:24] anything else in the in the global asset
[29:26] landscape at this point so I think a
[29:29] good chunk of real estate would be
[29:31] interested in sitting in Bitcoin instead
[29:34] I think I I use the number of 30% of the
[29:37] bond market would be interested in in in
[29:40] being in Bitcoin instead because Bitcoin
[29:42] serves the uh use case of bonds um
[29:46] better than bonds do because the whole
[29:49] point of bonds is to get a
[29:52] small um reliable
[29:56] yield uh for tying up your money today
[29:59] and that yield will slightly outpace
[30:03] inflation that's that's the that's the
[30:05] whole point of bonds and the I think the
[30:08] reality of bonds right now is that the
[30:11] stated inflation is lower than actual
[30:14] inflation is and that will continue if
[30:17] not get worse into the future because of
[30:21] the current situation with the global
[30:23] sovereign debt and the need to print in
[30:26] order to stimulate the econ after 40
[30:28] Years of doing it um so I think that
[30:31] we're you know bonds are going to
[30:34] deliver a a yield below the inflation
[30:36] rate so going forward and probably
[30:39] already currently and that means that
[30:41] they are
[30:43] negative a negative proposition you're
[30:46] losing value you're destroying value
[30:48] every year you hold money in bonds and
[30:51] so you know what are you doing uh that's
[30:54] not a good store value Asset actually um
[30:57] and there's 300 trillion sitting in
[30:58] there in in in bonds
[31:01] today versus Bitcoin which um people
[31:05] think of as speculative and
[31:08] volatile but Bitcoin Pier Rashard likes
[31:11] to say this I like this um framing
[31:15] bitcoin's not volatile humans reacting
[31:18] to bitcoin are
[31:19] volatile uh and that that's true that
[31:22] you know you can rely on bitcoin's
[31:24] increasing scarcity it's Supply schedule
[31:26] playing out and the
[31:28] you know all the supply demand price um
[31:32] phenomenon is Downstream of
[31:34] that and that will continue and Bitcoin
[31:38] I think it I think it will continue to
[31:41] deliver at least 25% annualized returns
[31:45] which makes it way better than bonds
[31:47] despite it being you know the same sort
[31:50] of thing of like you're you're you're
[31:51] tucking away
[31:53] money in an asset that will deliver
[31:56] some reliable return that that that's
[31:59] actually Bitcoin people just don't
[32:02] realize that people think that it's the
[32:05] inverse um anyway so in my analysis I I
[32:08] pegged it as only 30% of bonds would be
[32:11] interested in in migrating to
[32:13] bitcoin uh it could be much higher than
[32:16] that right anyway so you go down all the
[32:19] whole list of of all the asset buckets
[32:21] and you put together some rough
[32:23] expectation of what uh Bitcoin could eat
[32:26] from the existing allocations to
[32:29] different buckets and all I summed all
[32:32] that up and I got $200 trillion do of of
[32:35] bitcoin's full potential
[32:38] valuation and that amounts to 20 20 25%
[32:44] of um the the existing Global asset
[32:48] Landscapes so call it
[32:50] 20% and that's the important number
[32:52] there is that I think that Bitcoin could
[32:54] be could become 20% of the the world's
[32:58] value and a few a few points
[33:01] there I partly made this analysis
[33:04] because the the meme of infinity divided
[33:07] by 21 million um I think is it it it
[33:12] irks me it there's something wrong about
[33:14] it um from a mathematical point of view
[33:17] like because you know Infinity divided
[33:19] by 21 million is that is obviously
[33:22] Infinity but you're never going to have
[33:24] infinite purchasing power by holding one
[33:26] Bitcoin you're your purchasing power is
[33:28] bounded by how many other Bitcoin there
[33:31] are but also um how much P purchasing
[33:36] power sits in Bitcoin as an asset
[33:39] relative to other existing asset classes
[33:41] you your purchasing power of Bitcoin is
[33:43] whatever the exchange rate is for you
[33:45] know an acre of
[33:47] land you know like there's always going
[33:49] to be some balance between people
[33:50] wanting to hold property real estate
[33:54] Monae paintings you know you're always
[33:56] going to have something like that
[33:59] um anyway so the the full potential
[34:00] valuation kind of allowed me to arrive
[34:04] at a at a what I think is a conservative
[34:06] estimate for what Bitcoin could
[34:10] represent and I didn't I didn't set a
[34:12] date to it I said decades um because I
[34:16] specifically didn't want
[34:18] to you know put a date in out there but
[34:21] you know that could be that could be 20
[34:23] years that could be 50 years um but the
[34:26] important part is is that if the logic
[34:31] in that analysis is true then Bitcoin
[34:35] become grows from being 1 1,000th of the
[34:38] world's asset assets to 20% of the
[34:42] world's assets which is a
[34:46] 200x gain in relative to other assets so
[34:51] that's that you know that removes the
[34:53] dollar measuring stick issue and says
[34:56] that that's real growth of 200x relative
[35:00] to other assets that are out there um
[35:03] and and
[35:05] that one is is a huge number um and I
[35:09] hope happens and I think it's actually
[35:11] conservative uh in the in the grand
[35:14] scheme um and it it gets rid of the
[35:18] problem of of like what is a dollar what
[35:20] is what does it mean so that that $10
[35:22] million per Bitcoin number is in today's
[35:26] dollars and I think that's important
[35:28] thing that whenever people talk about um
[35:31] you know the the future dollar price of
[35:33] Bitcoin like if they're talking about
[35:35] the the dollar price in the future it
[35:37] doesn't mean anything if they're talking
[35:38] about it in today's dollars it has
[35:41] meaning um and and that's that's
[35:44] something that that people often lose
[35:46] sight of but anyway so $10 million in
[35:49] today's dollars several decades now from
[35:53] now is the bitcoin's full potential
[35:56] valuation granted conservative full
[35:58] potential valuation if you watch or
[36:01] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[36:03] I'll guess you already bought some
[36:05] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[36:08] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[36:11] in a hardware wallet my personal
[36:13] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[36:15] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[36:18] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[36:20] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[36:23] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[36:27] with the code Robin at the checkout
[36:29] visit bitbox
[36:31] dowis robobin to get your bitbox and if
[36:34] you really want to bulletproof your self
[36:37] custody setup your security setup and
[36:39] maybe even your citizenship setup you
[36:42] have to talk to the Bitcoin way if you
[36:45] go to the Bitcoin way.com
[36:48] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[36:51] free call where you can dive deep with
[36:55] them if your self custody setup is is
[36:57] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[37:00] maybe might be improvable or your
[37:03] digital footprint in general is secure
[37:06] they are the experts in cyber security
[37:09] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[37:12] secure sovereign individual in general
[37:15] and last but not least I have something
[37:17] completely new for you guys I partnered
[37:21] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[37:24] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[37:27] saw created by anyone look at that
[37:30] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[37:33] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[37:36] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[37:39] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[37:41] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[37:45] make sure to check out the link in the
[37:47] description for those amazing coin
[37:49] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[37:52] amazing I love them so much it was
[37:53] really hard for me to pick the one that
[37:56] I want to have because they a lot of
[37:58] great options I went with the new
[38:00] transparency Edition they're all limited
[38:04] so grab yours those will not be
[38:06] available for a long time but there will
[38:08] come new models and new amazing designs
[38:11] along the way yeah it's interesting for
[38:13] me because um like some of the
[38:16] percentages especially in bonds and and
[38:18] other things uh they're for for me very
[38:21] conservative where like oh who who wants
[38:24] to hold bonds I mean there could be
[38:26] Bitcoin bonds uh could be something
[38:28] instrumental around that but then it
[38:31] would also be in the Bitcoin bucket and
[38:33] not in the bond bucket really uh so that
[38:36] that that could really quickly uh go in
[38:40] a whole different direction like when we
[38:43] put like 20% with the conservative case
[38:46] but then there's maybe a pool case of I
[38:47] don't know
[38:48] 40% uh how much is there like I hear
[38:52] some people saying like uh Bitcoin is
[38:55] half of everything because it's money so
[38:57] that would mean like maybe 50% like
[39:00] that's an interesting case yeah that
[39:02] that's that's quite possible um and and
[39:04] that's a little bit of what sailor uh
[39:06] has sort of trotted out in his most
[39:08] recent um presentation which was
[39:11] excellent uh and and Rift on this
[39:14] starting point um yeah I think that's
[39:18] that's a quite a
[39:20] reasonable uh prediction is that Bitcoin
[39:23] could eat half not so I said 20% and
[39:26] that those was pretty conservative
[39:29] numbers it could be 50% of the world's
[39:32] assets get consumed by Bitcoin and and
[39:34] importantly that that would mean a
[39:37] 500x from
[39:39] today relative to other asset classes um
[39:42] for Bitcoin so you know that and again
[39:45] that removes that dollar measuring stick
[39:48] issue but you know think about it in
[39:51] those terms of like if if we were to
[39:53] reach half of all assets um and I you
[39:57] know I think that's actually probably
[40:00] more realistic than my numbers my
[40:02] numbers are sort of I think I think it's
[40:05] necessary to put out conservative
[40:07] numbers when you're when you're doing
[40:09] new analysis because um you don't want
[40:12] people to object to your estimates as
[40:16] unreasonable you want people to engage
[40:18] with the framework and you know when you
[40:21] have conservative numbers the framework
[40:23] is is what people focus on so yeah 50%
[40:27] it seems logically more likely and
[40:32] that's pretty crazy so that would
[40:34] be what that that would be boy a 50x
[40:41] from sorry a 500x from from today so
[40:45] 60k boy what would that put us that 12
[40:49] no more than that what would that be I
[40:52] mean if 20% is that 30 million I think
[40:55] it's 30 million per Bitcoin in today's
[40:57] so like uh uh 20% around that are like a
[41:01] 10 million so if you get to to to the 50
[41:04] million that's around like 30 million
[41:06] where where because you said like sailor
[41:10] puts his numbers like he deres his
[41:13] models from from your uh uh numbers
[41:17] where does he get his bull case for what
[41:19] was it 2045 with 49 million dollars I
[41:23] think his bull case was 49 his base was
[41:27] 13 and the bear was like 3 million yeah
[41:31] um yeah they haven't released their
[41:33] model yet they they um they were saying
[41:37] they're they're going to um and yeah his
[41:41] numbers are
[41:42] that his his analysis over last year and
[41:45] especially in the most recent U
[41:47] Nashville presentation I think use my uh
[41:50] my numbers as a starting point um and
[41:54] and also just use that that framework of
[41:56] how to think about what Bitcoin could be
[41:58] as as like a mental model that they're
[42:00] then adjusting the assumptions for um
[42:03] and that's how they ended up getting the
[42:05] The Bare Base and and bull case one
[42:08] important difference with their model is
[42:11] that um so you know he said he said 20
[42:13] years in the future so he specified a
[42:15] date which is a good idea because it
[42:18] grounds people um again that's that's
[42:20] one of those like assumptions that you
[42:23] don't want to put out originally because
[42:26] uh people could object to that
[42:27] assumption but you know sailor sailor
[42:30] can do it um and the other piece in
[42:33] there is that the future State um
[42:35] assumes four quadrillion in in global
[42:39] asset value um which is to say that
[42:43] everything will have forax in price by
[42:45] then so I so I think the Assumption
[42:48] there it there's sort of two
[42:50] possibilities there you could you could
[42:52] argue that that means that Global wealth
[42:54] has the world has gotten four times
[42:56] richer um I don't think that's what
[42:58] sailor intends there because I think
[43:02] he like me views um everything in in
[43:05] relative
[43:06] competition um and so that the other
[43:10] alternative is that uh everything is
[43:13] four four times more expensive um
[43:15] basically that the dollar has been
[43:17] debased
[43:18] forx uh and I think that's that's what
[43:22] he intends there but so the so for
[43:26] quadrillion and then growing
[43:29] to
[43:31] um was the top number 40 it was 43 Milli
[43:35] 4 49 was the top number from from him
[43:38] yeah and three million was the the the
[43:41] bease one yeah right yeah so so
[43:44] the interesting enough you for all of
[43:47] those numbers you have to divide by four
[43:49] to to get what that would be in today's
[43:51] dollars um which is a little bit of
[43:55] slight of hand I think which is great
[43:56] Market
[43:57] um on Sailor part because people see the
[44:00] the dollar number and it's and it's
[44:02] bigger and that is
[44:04] exciting um so the 49 would be 12
[44:08] million in today's dollars so that that
[44:11] actually kind of lines up with my full
[44:12] potential valuation $10 million number
[44:16] um the other
[44:19] ones and and again now it's the bull
[44:22] case and I I suppose that sort of means
[44:26] um well I I know that what they did well
[44:29] what I would have done and I think what
[44:30] they probably did is in the model they
[44:34] just have different um annualized growth
[44:37] rates uh I think if I was them what I
[44:41] would do is the F for the F for the bull
[44:44] case start at 50% annualized growth um
[44:49] and then every year drop at
[44:51] 1% uh and see where that comes out to I
[44:55] did and uh and for the the base case
[44:58] start at 40% and drop at 1% every year
[45:01] see what it comes out to and for the
[45:02] bare case start start at 30 and drop it
[45:06] 1% every
[45:07] year and um I did some I did a just a on
[45:13] my phone I calculated that what that
[45:15] would mean for the base case and it came
[45:17] out to about 13 million um so I think
[45:21] that's probably like roughly what
[45:23] they're what they were working with in
[45:25] terms of how they got those numbers
[45:27] um which which is to say it's it's not
[45:31] you know there's there's not uh any
[45:33] particular magic to it or or any greater
[45:36] Credence to those numbers than than than
[45:39] that that's how you end up calculating
[45:42] numbers like these um there's no magic
[45:45] to it it's it's just kind of reasonable
[45:48] assumptions and then seeing what the
[45:50] outputs are so I have a feeling that's
[45:53] pretty much what they did we'll see what
[45:54] they if they release their model what
[45:56] they actually did but um that's my guess
[46:01] did you as uh Michael sailor used your
[46:05] models a lot already uh did he talk with
[46:09] you in deep like did you had some some
[46:11] session with him where you talked about
[46:13] about those models before he released
[46:14] that or did he just use it pretty much
[46:18] the latter it's funny um when I put out
[46:21] that article he he retweeted it and uh
[46:25] and and you know included a a comment in
[46:29] his tweet of like you know this is an
[46:31] interesting analysis with some
[46:33] reasonable assumptions like something
[46:34] very muted like that like he he wasn't
[46:37] sticking his neck out uh and he dm' me
[46:40] saying this is very elegant work which
[46:42] is you know a great DM to receive on
[46:45] Twitter
[46:46] um and and that I thought that was that
[46:49] I thought that was that was you know
[46:52] that was it but then he did a
[46:54] presentation I think that was in uh
[46:56] Bitcoin Prague
[46:57] last
[46:58] spring and he started with that
[47:02] slide
[47:04] um and and he's been using that in all
[47:07] of his presentations since which has
[47:09] been a you know a tremendous honor um
[47:13] really cool to see and uh and yeah I
[47:17] think um it it's I guess he sort
[47:20] of views Bitcoin the way I do in terms
[47:23] of like that perspective is really
[47:25] helpful for grounding any any sort of
[47:28] talk about Bitcoin is like this shows
[47:31] how early it still is it's 1 1,000th of
[47:33] the world's assets 0.1 the the globe
[47:37] collectively the world collectively has
[47:39] a 0.1% allocation to bitcoin right
[47:43] now that's how early it still is like so
[47:46] you know you and I can have a 50 plus
[47:50] percent allocation to bitcoin and we and
[47:52] we know a lot of people who also have
[47:54] that and it feels like that Community is
[47:57] large and Bitcoin is you know already a
[48:01] big deal um but the reality of it is
[48:04] that it's still a 0.1% allocation from a
[48:08] from a worldwide Capital allocation
[48:11] perspective um so anyway I I think you
[48:15] know that's that's what Michael sailor
[48:17] has been using as part of sort of
[48:19] framing his entire um presentations the
[48:23] last year so kind of starting and ending
[48:24] with that which which is also what do
[48:27] when I when I present any slides about
[48:29] Bitcoin um and his most recent one sort
[48:33] of building building on top of that uh
[48:37] analysis to to come up with that the The
[48:40] Bare Base and and bull case numbers that
[48:43] he's putting out uh putting out there
[48:46] really as like a nudge to um to
[48:49] individuals but really corporate and
[48:51] nation state uh potential adopters you
[48:55] know to kind of anchor they're thinking
[48:57] about what Bitcoin could be just 20
[48:59] years from now um which I think is I
[49:02] think is a seminal moment for for
[49:05] Bitcoin analysis about like what how
[49:08] does this asset fit into the global
[49:10] asset landscape um we have kind of more
[49:13] precise numbers from a really credible
[49:16] uh evangelist um that that everyone in
[49:19] the world is going to listen to and put
[49:22] some stock in uh and I think that we
[49:25] will probably look back on on that
[49:28] particular the the Bitcoin Nashville
[49:30] presentation as very consequential for
[49:33] accelerating corporate and nation state
[49:35] adop adoption of
[49:37] Bitcoin I think so too and uh there's
[49:40] like two points I want to cover like
[49:41] first like as you said we are so early
[49:44] and sometimes in that Bitcoin Circle we
[49:47] forget how early we are because you get
[49:50] more and more bitcoiners as friends and
[49:52] more and more of your friends get to be
[49:55] in Bitcoin and then you like oh they are
[49:57] all in Bitcoin they have 50% they
[49:59] already also have 10% what's the
[50:02] potential then I just invite everyone go
[50:05] on the street and ask some random
[50:07] questions about Bitcoin that then you
[50:09] really get a feeling how early we are so
[50:12] like we have we we are not even at like
[50:16] a we not even at the starting point like
[50:18] we we are maybe slowly slowly starting
[50:21] out like we have some corporations in
[50:24] there we have a nation state with
[50:26] Salvador
[50:27] playing with it a little bit because
[50:29] even they have just 5% of the Assets in
[50:32] Bitcoin that that's not bold like 50%
[50:34] would be bold uh but they also have to
[50:37] like slowly get that they cannot just
[50:38] like throw everything in Bitcoin and
[50:41] then how many of the bitcoiners are
[50:44] actually over 10% of their net worth in
[50:47] Bitcoin I think that's a very selective
[50:49] small Elite group that I actually have a
[50:52] high conviction about Bitcoin uh like I
[50:55] myself I have I think 1003 or 100 14% in
[50:58] Bitcoin I'm working my way down to I'm
[51:01] working my way down to
[51:03] 95 as I'm having now my company and
[51:05] everything but uh like I'm completely in
[51:09] Bitcoin but that's a very small select
[51:12] group of people uh that is not large uh
[51:16] and we should not forget as bitcoiners
[51:19] like I think as as a human beings we
[51:22] always have this concept of like oh I'm
[51:24] like that so I assume a lot of other
[51:25] people like that and this assumption is
[51:29] completely wrong if you
[51:32] Bitcoin um that's it's more right if
[51:34] you're not a bitcoiner the other thing
[51:36] uh which is really interesting I think
[51:38] the the Bitcoin conference in Nashville
[51:40] unfortunately I wasn't there uh but I
[51:43] wish I would have been there was a very
[51:45] bullish one like uh so many like the
[51:48] corporate interest there was amazing and
[51:51] then and the political political
[51:54] interest was amazing I mean I loved
[51:56] rfk's speech like he really nailed
[51:59] everything that Bitcoin has want to hear
[52:01] and that from an uh presidential
[52:03] candidate Trump speech was for a lot of
[52:06] people disappointing I actually liked it
[52:09] like I was like he that's that's
[52:11] probably the next pres president of the
[52:14] United States and he's talking that like
[52:17] you also have to put it in context like
[52:19] Trump cannot say the same things that
[52:21] RFK is saying like RFK can say it
[52:23] because he is a 1% chance of being the
[52:26] president
[52:27] he Trump has over 50% chance that he's
[52:29] actually the next president so that like
[52:31] there's context to that and Michel SAA
[52:35] um putting out that so like in overall I
[52:37] I love the conference actually and it
[52:39] was very bullish to see also like uh all
[52:42] those Partnerships like the small
[52:43] Partnerships with like Bitcoin magazine
[52:45] micro strategy and all those things that
[52:47] going around in the conference the small
[52:50] announcements small announcements of of
[52:51] big companies uh buying more and more
[52:54] Bitcoin like overall we are really I
[52:57] feel like in the in the in the most
[53:00] special era right now where the risk
[53:02] reward is so attractive uh where the
[53:04] risk is already very very low and the
[53:07] reward is still like we still have like
[53:10] 100% of the reward in front of us um
[53:13] that's that's just uh yeah amazing for
[53:15] me to
[53:16] see yeah totally
[53:19] um yeah I think we will I think we will
[53:21] look back on that conference as as a bit
[53:24] of a milestone for bitcoin's um progress
[53:27] into the mainstream um as a as a player
[53:30] on the global stage yeah it's true that
[53:34] that the the Trump speech was about as
[53:37] much as you could hope for uh
[53:40] realistically um but you there was a bit
[53:43] more hype beforehand about how there's
[53:45] going to be like you know the million
[53:47] Bitcoin strategic Reserve that that
[53:49] Trump never mentioned um but you know
[53:52] that's fine that it's going in the right
[53:55] direction because because the prior
[53:57] year you know just one year ago we had
[54:01] the Bitcoin Miami Conference where RFK
[54:04] made his first speech about Bitcoin and
[54:07] that was a huge deal because that was a
[54:11] a u a presidential candidate porting the
[54:16] the Bitcoin cohort for the first time
[54:19] and and coming to bitcoin's Turf to talk
[54:23] you know to Pander to bitcoiners and and
[54:26] Bitcoin the Bitcoin industry in order to
[54:28] try to like generate um enthusiasm for
[54:33] this this candidate uh that was a huge
[54:36] deal a year ago and then just fast
[54:38] forward just one year and you could have
[54:40] the the likely future president doing
[54:43] the same thing that's that's it kind of
[54:47] blows my mind like I thought that would
[54:48] happen four years later I thought it
[54:49] would take a full election cycle before
[54:52] the you know the the
[54:54] main um one of the you main political
[54:58] parties would take the RFK Playbook from
[55:01] Miami and do the same thing and it was
[55:04] only one year later um I I did think the
[55:08] uh the
[55:10] RFK uh idea of sort of framing the the
[55:16] necessity of a
[55:19] um of a national Bitcoin strategic
[55:22] Reserve around the the context of what
[55:25] we have with gold already you know from
[55:28] from a US perspective um that was
[55:33] actually a new a new thought to me and I
[55:36] think a really important thing that's
[55:38] now been incepted out into the world um
[55:43] that we could see mattering a ton uh
[55:47] over the next 10 years and and that was
[55:50] that um the US has 19% of uh Global
[55:57] gold
[56:00] stores
[56:01] and that in the implication in in that
[56:05] in what he talked about was that to
[56:07] match that sort of
[56:09] relative um position that that the us
[56:13] enjoys with gold the us would have to to
[56:16] stockpile 4 million Bitcoin you know if
[56:19] Bitcoin is going to become digital gold
[56:22] for the 21st
[56:23] century and the US wants to maintain
[56:26] that
[56:28] relative uh position then that's what
[56:31] the US has to do is is accumulate 4
[56:34] million Bitcoin and I love that thought
[56:37] I love that idea that that is that's
[56:40] been incepted now um into the discourse
[56:45] about nation state adoption of Bitcoin
[56:47] of like well you should probably meet or
[56:51] exceed whatever percentage of the
[56:53] world's gold you have like like that's
[56:55] your opport opportunity as a nation
[56:57] state like you have that opportunity at
[56:58] this moment in time to be a first mover
[57:02] in hoarding stockpiling and hoarding
[57:05] Bitcoin such that you could exceed your
[57:09] your relative position that you have
[57:11] today with with gold as a as the world's
[57:15] historical um store value um neutral
[57:19] Reserve
[57:20] asset and and so that could be huge that
[57:23] that could be just a fantastic thing
[57:25] because we that could be the basis for a
[57:29] future
[57:31] um International competition to
[57:33] stockpile Bitcoin in order to better uh
[57:38] a a a country's relative position versus
[57:41] what they have been stuck with over you
[57:44] know their their history with gold
[57:47] because real realistically like for
[57:50] example like if you are if you're in the
[57:52] Middle East if you're like Qatar um oil
[57:55] rich
[57:57] but probably realistically late to the
[58:00] game in terms of stockpiling gold you
[58:03] know 6,000 years of history of gold and
[58:04] a lot of that
[58:06] stockpiling probably last happened in uh
[58:10] in you know the Monarch era of uh of
[58:14] Europe and um you know the last 200
[58:17] years really but Qatar and a lot of the
[58:20] other oil Rich Nations have only been
[58:22] Rich for the last 50
[58:24] years um so they were late to the game
[58:27] and probably don't have as much of a of
[58:28] a gold stockpile as they wish they had
[58:31] because that all that Gold's already
[58:33] accounted for basically but here's your
[58:35] opportunity now with digital gold with
[58:37] gold for the 21st century
[58:39] to you know um get a bigger slice of the
[58:43] pie than you have been stuck with in the
[58:45] in the historical gold- based world so I
[58:48] think that that I think that idea could
[58:50] be really big for um setting these like
[58:54] these ambitious aspirations for
[58:56] sovereigns all over the world of like
[58:59] I'm going to go and get mine I'm going
[59:00] to I'm going to accumulate a big chunk
[59:03] and then that you know there's only 21
[59:06] million and
[59:09] uh um 20 million of that is already out
[59:12] there being held by bitcoiners at this
[59:15] point so good luck nation states if
[59:18] you're going to if you're going to get 4
[59:20] million Bitcoin you're going to have to
[59:23] bid it up big time in order to get
[59:26] bitcoiners to part with their purchasing
[59:29] power that that was I was going to ask
[59:31] because um like like first of all I
[59:34] think um there's a like good number of
[59:38] Bitcoins lost so uh it's it's
[59:41] questionable if if the number is
[59:43] actually four million that the um us
[59:45] needs maybe it's just like two and a
[59:47] half or three million uh if you compare
[59:49] to the act available uh Bitcoin and then
[59:53] 4 million is that even possible like if
[59:56] even if they are starting right like
[59:57] even if Trump is elected and he's like
[60:00] oh yeah 4 million we need all the
[60:02] Bitcoin in our land uh is that even
[60:05] possible because he has to do it somehow
[60:08] publicly that would trigger a massive
[60:11] game f event where other nations are
[60:13] trying the same where companies are
[60:15] trying the same where individuals are
[60:17] all of the sudden trying the same I
[60:18] don't know if uh even three million or
[60:21] two and a half million like that I've
[60:24] I've I didn't look that deep in that but
[60:27] it's it's it's really hard for me to
[60:28] imagine that they actually could could
[60:30] pull 4 million Bitcoin uh right off like
[60:33] they're not so many available and the
[60:35] price would shoot up if if they
[60:36] consistently buy
[60:38] Bitcoin yeah
[60:40] um yeah it's I think it's probably
[60:42] possible for I think it's possible for
[60:45] one country that prints their own money
[60:50] one G7 country that prints their own
[60:53] money um to to accumulate 4 million
[60:58] Bitcoin uh whichever one does it first
[61:01] basically and which and they would have
[61:03] to do it
[61:04] secretly um because you're right like it
[61:07] once you signal that to the world and
[61:10] you state your plan then everybody else
[61:12] would act accordingly um but I think
[61:15] it's you know to and also to get four
[61:19] million Bitcoin to get the let's say 16
[61:23] million Bitcoin out there held held and
[61:26] not lost to get a quarter of
[61:30] that wow um I think that that would be
[61:36] that would require bidding Bitcoin up to
[61:38] a million
[61:39] dollars because I think that you know up
[61:42] there you'd have a lot of ogs a lot of
[61:45] bitcoiners who bought at
[61:47] 3,000 um who'd be happy to sell half
[61:51] their stack you know and I I think you'd
[61:53] get enough you'd get half of bit coiners
[61:56] would sell half their stack and then
[61:57] there you go you have one quarter of of
[62:00] what's
[62:01] available um so I think that's possible
[62:04] for one country to do and but once once
[62:09] there's an international competition for
[62:11] that um nobody will be able to get 4
[62:15] million on their own another interesting
[62:18] point um I talked I think tomorrow will
[62:21] be released the the talk with me and cjk
[62:24] and he's really big on Bitcoin being
[62:26] pristine collateral maybe those ogs
[62:30] don't have to sell maybe they can just
[62:32] like 10% of their stack they just like
[62:36] uh lend out and with the appreciation
[62:38] like I think also there are probably a
[62:40] lot of interesting products coming out
[62:42] for bitcoiners because uh they they want
[62:45] to do a lot of things like maybe those
[62:47] ogs are never forced to to sell they can
[62:49] just like living a really great life
[62:51] with 10% of their Bitcoin Landing it out
[62:53] or doing something with with that
[62:56] how do you how do you look at
[62:58] that yeah that's a great point that
[63:01] um the Advent of uh of of lending
[63:04] products that are more safe um will will
[63:10] be interesting because people won't have
[63:12] to sell their Bitcoin they'll just be
[63:13] borrowing against it um I don't know how
[63:17] that how that'll play out and uh yeah it
[63:21] does create an interesting Dynamic where
[63:23] people theoretically won't have to sell
[63:25] if Bitcoin they'll just be able to
[63:26] borrow dollars against it I do think
[63:29] that uh related to this topic I I think
[63:32] that that that'll I think the like
[63:35] hockey stick moment for Bitcoin uh in
[63:38] the world world will be
[63:40] when when
[63:42] um large pools of capital realize that
[63:46] they can borrow dollars
[63:48] for
[63:51] 5% and buy Bitcoin and watch that asset
[63:55] grow at 25 to 50% per
[63:58] year and just do that um I think the
[64:03] highest and best use of dollar debt is
[64:08] buying Bitcoin and I think that
[64:10] once major Capital Pools realize
[64:14] this then it's it's the endgame for the
[64:18] transition
[64:20] from Fiat money to um to bitcoin to the
[64:24] Bitcoin standard because
[64:26] people will do that all day long you
[64:28] know just um borrow what dollars they
[64:30] can and and use those dollars to buy
[64:34] Bitcoin um and you know you know once
[64:37] once that is set in motion it's it's
[64:40] just a flywheel that will send Bitcoin
[64:44] very high and make it and make it a
[64:46] fixture make it the preferred store
[64:48] value that that's how it really becomes
[64:51] like the world's money is once once the
[64:54] majority of or once it even even a 20%
[64:57] of the world's Capital has decided this
[64:59] is the best thing they could they could
[65:00] possibly be doing um then then it
[65:05] becomes you know the new system um so
[65:10] and and to get there like before we're
[65:12] we're able to do that we have to have uh
[65:14] more reliable lending products out there
[65:17] um you know Bitcoin underwriting needs
[65:19] to be better you know blockfi and
[65:21] Celsius are examples of how it can go
[65:24] wrong uh I think
[65:26] Unchained and bco are examples of how
[65:29] you can do it right um basically over
[65:32] collateralizing a little bit more and
[65:35] we're going to see more of that um and
[65:37] and those business models become more
[65:40] reliable uh and then that market can and
[65:43] will take off I think um you know the
[65:46] current cost of borrowing
[65:48] is 10
[65:51] 15% um and plus the risk that
[65:56] uh this platform that you're trusting
[65:59] might turn into a block fire Celsius
[66:02] right like like that's the cost of using
[66:06] you know deploying that that strategy of
[66:08] of borrowing against your Bitcoin today
[66:10] um and that
[66:12] is uncomfortably high for me right so
[66:15] like I'm not doing that today but if we
[66:17] get to a place where it's it's 6% and I
[66:21] have a high degree of confidence that
[66:23] that platform is not going to bust you
[66:25] know when there's a 75% draw down for
[66:28] Bitcoin um I'll do that all I will do
[66:31] that all day and so will other
[66:32] bitcoiners so we'll see it will be
[66:35] really interesting um there's like one
[66:37] last question that I have before we
[66:39] close the the the podcast um we talked a
[66:44] lot about like where we are adding uh
[66:47] where we could go and also like the the
[66:49] current situation um and now it's a
[66:52] little bit with future products how do
[66:55] we transition to the full potential like
[66:58] when we are going to look at like the
[67:00] transitioning time it's a long way till
[67:03] bitcoin's full adoption we are not even
[67:06] at 100K and 10 million is a is a a long
[67:10] way to there um do you imagine do you
[67:13] have anything like do you have any
[67:15] bigger products financial instruments
[67:17] that onramp more Bitcoin like the ETF
[67:20] was one big one I hear more people
[67:22] talking about Bitcoin bonds um is it
[67:25] just like we have built out everything
[67:28] now and those buckets will fill now how
[67:30] do you see the transitioning time going
[67:32] to this full potential Bitcoin yeah I
[67:35] think um you know I think it it it all
[67:38] stems from uh bitcoin's Supply mechanics
[67:41] right and those will keep increasing
[67:43] scarcity will keep playing out every
[67:44] four years which will keep driving the
[67:46] price of Bitcoin
[67:47] higher um and that will you know keep
[67:50] this Tailwind for Bitcoin Global Bitcoin
[67:52] adoption going because the you know the
[67:55] the single most important use case for
[67:56] Bitcoin is as a savings technology that
[67:59] grows your purchasing power over time
[68:00] because of increasing scarcity everybody
[68:03] in the world wants that every bit of
[68:05] capital wants wants that they just don't
[68:07] know it yet um so that all that has to
[68:10] happen for Bitcoin to continue winning
[68:13] is for that to keep happening however
[68:17] um that continuing to happen will will
[68:21] keep
[68:22] um developers and business people
[68:26] uh engaged with Bitcoin right so they
[68:28] will continue to build Solutions build
[68:30] infrastructure build business models
[68:33] that that are necessary
[68:37] infrastructure um around bitcoin's core
[68:40] value proposition of as savings
[68:42] technology so you know that's what we're
[68:44] doing at um at at at onramp I'm a
[68:48] co-founder of onramp um and we are a
[68:53] multi-institution custody platform
[68:56] uh which is a a the sort of next step in
[69:00] the evolution we think in the evolution
[69:02] of Bitcoin
[69:04] custody so you know for the last 15
[69:08] years people have had a choice between
[69:10] third party custody which basically
[69:12] means like leaving your coins on an
[69:13] exchange like like coinbase or Kraken or
[69:16] whatever um third party custody or self
[69:19] custody
[69:21] which early on meant you know having a
[69:26] um a
[69:28] wallet. file in your computer uh and
[69:32] then turned into
[69:35] um uh paper wallets and other things
[69:40] like that and then turned into hard
[69:41] single Sig Hardware wallet and then that
[69:43] turned into multisig collaborative
[69:45] custody which is sort of where what the
[69:48] best in uh Best in Class has been for
[69:50] the last handful of years and um
[69:53] multi-institution custody is a variation
[69:57] on that um that idea of setting up a
[70:02] multi- so you know we are a service that
[70:07] helps an indiv you know when an
[70:09] individual onboards with us um we set up
[70:12] a a um multisig multi-institution
[70:16] custody Vault for that client which
[70:19] means that you know it's a 203 multisig
[70:22] Arrangement where um the keyholders are
[70:25] not the
[70:26] individual which is how it is in
[70:28] collaborative custody and and multisig
[70:31] in general um but instead we've
[70:34] partnered with institutions that that
[70:37] hold a key on each hold one key on
[70:40] behalf of that end client so you have
[70:42] three institutions each holding one key
[70:45] none none have unilateral control
[70:48] because they only have hold one key and
[70:50] they all have a a direct legal
[70:52] relationship with the end client
[70:55] such that only the end client can direct
[70:58] the keyh holding institutions to sign on
[71:01] their behalf so in that way you have now
[71:05] removed a lot of the technical burden
[71:07] from setting up and maintaining your own
[71:09] multisig um which is daunting for any
[71:13] bitcoiner but you know a non-starter for
[71:15] a lot of not less technical people um
[71:19] and you have you know best in-class
[71:21] security because you've got multisig
[71:24] fault toall an built into that you know
[71:27] one of these three institutions could go
[71:29] under and you'd be fine because you can
[71:31] recover those assets using the other two
[71:34] keys um none of those you know
[71:37] institutions have unilateral control and
[71:39] now we're implementing and rolling out
[71:41] um
[71:42] multi-jurisdictional multi-institution
[71:44] multi-sig custody so you know that that
[71:48] means these keyh holding institutions
[71:50] are in different countries so you you've
[71:53] kind of removed that that that slight
[71:56] nagging um risk of uh what if you know
[72:00] the US government was to say all right
[72:03] all right um all all of you key holders
[72:06] have to hand over your keys
[72:08] today well that solves for that kind of
[72:11] becomes the whole The Grail of uh of
[72:14] Bitcoin custody in our view where you
[72:17] know you you see an end there there's
[72:20] now an endstate emerging of um
[72:23] distributed risk with def fault
[72:25] tolerance across
[72:27] jurisdictions uh and geographies which
[72:30] you know becomes effectively impossible
[72:33] for any sort of bad actor
[72:35] to to uh uh either perform a man in the-
[72:40] Middle attack or um you know the a
[72:43] common problem right now with people who
[72:45] store their coins on exchanges is these
[72:48] social engineering hackers convince
[72:51] those people to hand over their
[72:52] credentials to log in and then and then
[72:54] their funds get swept um you know all
[72:56] that all those risks get removed the
[72:58] wrench attack risk gets removed for the
[73:00] individual because they're no longer
[73:02] holding their keys they have hired
[73:06] institutions holding their keys on on
[73:09] their behalf so anyway that's that's
[73:11] what I've been spending most of my time
[73:13] on we're very excited about it you can
[73:15] if you're interested in to your audience
[73:18] if you guys um are interested in that
[73:20] check out onr bitcoin.com you can
[73:22] schedule a consultation and and talk
[73:25] with us about this concept if you're
[73:27] even vaguely interested in in how you
[73:30] know for a lot of our clients they have
[73:32] a self custody set up and they um move a
[73:37] portion of their assets into onramps
[73:39] multi-institution custody as a way to
[73:42] diversify the risk so that you don't
[73:43] have all your eggs in one basket so you
[73:45] know if you're interested in talking
[73:47] about that um give us a
[73:49] hauler amazing I think uh it's it's like
[73:53] I love everyone that is innovating and
[73:58] is uh developing in any way shap form
[74:01] self custody like and and multi-
[74:05] institutional self- custody is also
[74:07] self- custody like right at the end of
[74:09] the day it is because you're not giving
[74:11] your you're not giving your coins to any
[74:14] institution it you you still retain
[74:17] control I think that's the important
[74:19] it's it's not a self- custody
[74:21] setup but it's not a third custody third
[74:23] party custody setup um but ultimately
[74:26] you retain control of your coins
[74:29] so that's the the essence of self-
[74:32] custody ultimately is you have
[74:34] control absolutely 100% agreed as we are
[74:38] now close to the end of the podcast I
[74:40] have one question that is always the
[74:41] same question for every guest um what
[74:44] can we learn from you besides all the
[74:46] things that we already talked about
[74:48] interesting um yeah
[74:51] I I'm not sure what you can learn from
[74:54] me
[74:55] um what I what I have done is you know
[74:58] I've been putting out Bitcoin
[75:00] educational content
[75:02] for years now um and
[75:05] I've assembled like a compendium of all
[75:08] my best um uh graphics and bits of
[75:13] analysis and articles uh into a tweet
[75:16] thread that's sitting at the top of my
[75:18] Twitter page um so if you're interested
[75:21] in seeing my analysis over the years or
[75:25] uh you know reading some of my articles
[75:27] like why the yepy elite dismissed
[75:30] Bitcoin or Bitcoin in the American West
[75:32] which um are probably my two other big
[75:36] ones that we didn't that that people
[75:38] seem to like a lot besides the full
[75:40] potential valuation you can go check
[75:42] those out um via my uh the the Tweet
[75:46] that's pinned at the top of my uh
[75:47] Twitter page which is um at CIS c o s
[75:52] _ BTC
[75:55] uh that's my Twitter handle you can find
[75:57] it all
[75:58] there amazing perfect and thank you so
[76:01] much for for uh being all already uh one
[76:03] thing uh we have an end routine where
[76:05] the previous guest is asking a question
[76:07] for the next guest without knowing who
[76:08] the next guest actually is uh and your
[76:11] question is an interesting one how long
[76:13] did it take you to understand uh Bitcoin
[76:16] yeah a while um I went through the the
[76:19] way of pain uh I I got into uh ethereum
[76:25] in
[76:26] 2016 and uh then when that started doing
[76:30] well in 2017 I went down the altcoin
[76:33] path and I you know went into all sorts
[76:35] of altcoin stuff uh got murdered in
[76:39] 2018 you know very humbling uh very very
[76:42] painful
[76:43] experience and then uh was forced to try
[76:46] to figure out what I was missing um so
[76:49] early 2019 I
[76:51] started accepting the Bitcoin maximum
[76:55] point of view and digging deeper into
[76:59] all the literature around
[77:01] that
[77:03] and like for most Bitcoin maximist I had
[77:06] like a six-month period
[77:08] of of uh of manic
[77:12] Zeal as as I realized that this was the
[77:16] answer to everything um and so you know
[77:20] from the time I got into crypto until
[77:23] the time I fully under you know I I got
[77:26] to the Bitcoin
[77:28] maximalist uh point of view was 4 years
[77:31] which I think it it's easier to bypass
[77:34] that now I think it's easier to get
[77:36] there quicker now but but I think it's
[77:38] it's also probably going to remain the
[77:42] the mode I suppose the most common um
[77:45] number of years that it takes to fully
[77:47] understand Bitcoin it's interesting for
[77:49] for me it's also four years uh it took
[77:52] me three years three years to First Buy
[77:55] from when I first heard it and then one
[77:57] year to actually fully understand it and
[77:59] go all in U perfect then yeah thank you
[78:01] so much for being on you already
[78:03] mentioned your Twitter is that the best
[78:05] way to to reach out to you yeah yeah
[78:07] that's that's the best one uh _
[78:10] BTC perfect then thank you so much for
[78:12] taking your time and being on also thank
[78:14] you so much for everyone watching and
[78:16] listening as always I'll be back
[78:18] tomorrow uh with another episode bye-bye
