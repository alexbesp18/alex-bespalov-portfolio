--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] there was a lot of development done
[00:02] specifically in this last bare cycle I
[00:04] haven't seen so much in the two cycles
[00:06] before we have this decentralized
[00:08] database that is backed by the most
[00:11] powerful computer network on the planet
[00:13] and information that is basically
[00:15] inscribed into that blockchain is there
[00:18] forever irrevocable can't be changed it
[00:21] gives so much room for Innovation we're
[00:23] only doing Bitcoin mining and nothing
[00:25] else we're not into clown coins or
[00:27] coins with it's not your keys not your
[00:29] wallet SL own your keys on your wallet
[00:31] it really Fosters accountability and
[00:33] Independence and self-thinking critical
[00:36] thinking and questioning it's the
[00:38] absolute coolest industry that
[00:40] one can work in spend their time
[00:42] [Music]
[00:46] in I heard you currently in Parra it
[00:49] looks really beautiful where you are
[00:51] actually in in it's like a library kind
[00:53] of a style it is a very nice Library um
[00:57] and yes I'm in Paraguay I'm in as
[01:00] right now just came back from a from a
[01:03] very short night um last night our team
[01:06] and I were preparing the first bch of um
[01:09] our new product Bitcoin beef um to be
[01:12] dried by Bitcoin miners so very exciting
[01:15] stuff going on wait you you're trying
[01:19] Bitcoin beef with Bitcoin miners right
[01:23] yes that's interesting how do how does
[01:25] this come together well I mean when we
[01:27] started um I mean the name is not for no
[01:30] reason green mining Dow um when we
[01:32] started we we we we agreed that we want
[01:36] to change the financial system out of
[01:38] multiple reasons and probably get into
[01:39] this today um but we don't want to
[01:42] sacrifice our
[01:44] ecological um system for that and
[01:46] therefore we decided to only take CO2
[01:48] neutral and green energy water so that's
[01:52] Hydro wind and solar for us uh at the
[01:55] same time the energy is converted
[01:57] largely into heat um and if we don't
[02:01] reuse the heat we F this is going that's
[02:04] a waste um so when we started right from
[02:07] the GetGo we designed our facilities or
[02:10] we're designing our facilities in a way
[02:11] that we can reuse the heat repurpose the
[02:13] heat the excesses heat excess heat and
[02:16] we started with the mango Bitcoin mango
[02:18] Paraguay has a a mango issue too many
[02:20] mangoes um during a very specific time
[02:23] of the year so what we did um we
[02:25] supported the local Society or the local
[02:28] um population
[02:30] to earn a little bit extra money and get
[02:32] us these mangoes and um wash them peel
[02:35] them chop them and then dry them in a
[02:37] drying oven which receives filtered air
[02:39] from the air cooled Mining facility um
[02:42] and then let them let them dry for a
[02:44] while and then you get the nicest
[02:46] tastiest sweetest Bitcoin mango um dried
[02:51] mango our like our team loves it our our
[02:54] investors love it people that we give it
[02:56] to love it and just say it's simply the
[02:58] best mango I've ever eaten and we just
[03:00] simply say Financial Freedom has never
[03:02] tasted so sweet and uh the the beef
[03:05] jerky is something that is less seasonal
[03:08] um it's it's it's a different ball game
[03:10] because you're switching from fruits to
[03:12] to beef but uh that's something that
[03:14] we've been now looking at for quite a
[03:15] while and um uh change the operation and
[03:18] construction side uh Slash the the
[03:20] drying side slightly so that we can also
[03:23] process that and and that's what we're
[03:24] doing now so uh yesterday the first bch
[03:28] was cut and seasoned and it's going to
[03:30] be dried this morning so we're looking
[03:33] forward I'll let you know and I can send
[03:34] you a sample but yeah eventually dried
[03:37] beef jerky utilizing the excess heat of
[03:40] a air cooled Bitcoin mine here in
[03:42] Paraguay that's amaz I love the ReUse of
[03:46] the heat like using Bitcoin
[03:48] miners uh and using the access heat the
[03:51] using the access things that come from
[03:53] Bitcoin mining to mine Bitcoin and to
[03:56] something else I heard from Finland they
[03:57] have like apartment buildings where use
[04:00] the excess heat to uh heat up the
[04:02] apartment buildings so they can all save
[04:04] on the electric bill it's it's amazing
[04:06] what you can do with mining um one thing
[04:09] I just want to quickly go in because I
[04:10] think beef is is such a such a Bitcoin
[04:14] culture thing and it's really really
[04:16] fascinating to see that this um food is
[04:19] so connected all of the sudden with
[04:21] money and with with with with Bitcoin
[04:24] it's it's kind of unbelievable for me
[04:27] how how this came to be well is is that
[04:29] something uh it's like Bitcoin beef and
[04:32] is that is that what a bitcoiner is like
[04:34] is would you uh would you characterize
[04:38] like that so I do think that many
[04:41] bitcoiners especially like on Noster
[04:44] they send pictures all night over their
[04:46] Stakes that they're eating so I guess
[04:47] it's some sort of a Bitcoin thing um I
[04:51] personally love eating beef and I have
[04:54] ever always been and um it seems like
[04:57] the Bitcoin community just simply loves
[05:00] beef I mean it makes sense right it's um
[05:03] it's what made us smart over uh hundreds
[05:06] of thousands of years of millions of
[05:08] years it's what uh made us a strong um
[05:12] um population uh strong Society um it is
[05:17] healthy it is um nonprocessed ideally it
[05:21] is nonprocessed so there there's
[05:23] multiple um good things about this
[05:25] protein rich food um and I think Bitcoin
[05:30] many bitcoiners just just seem to have
[05:32] understood it not only bitcoiners though
[05:34] I think there is a a big big uh wave of
[05:38] of people understanding that uh vegan
[05:41] processed food is not necessarily the
[05:43] best for uh the human body and um
[05:46] they're somewhat investigating more on
[05:48] that stigma or narrative ah we we can't
[05:52] eat beef because it's bad for the world
[05:54] and and also the sad animals or the the
[05:57] poor animals um I think I think that is
[05:59] a a narrative that many many people are
[06:01] questioning I think it is very it's it's
[06:04] not the easiest topic just like many
[06:06] things in today's world it's not a
[06:07] single-sided coin it has um multiple
[06:10] facets to look at but I think that's not
[06:13] our our topic today right no it's it's
[06:17] definitely not our topic it's I'm also
[06:19] not an expert with flag because I I had
[06:22] once uh I forgot his name the book that
[06:25] wrote with the the guy that wrote with
[06:27] CER Mo book about f food I think
[06:31] Matthew luak or something like that and
[06:34] with him I had to talk and it was
[06:36] fascinating how emotional the discussion
[06:39] was in the comment section about vegan
[06:41] versus carnivore and I'm like oh I love
[06:44] my plants I love uh here and there some
[06:47] some steak or here and there some some
[06:48] some Meats so like I'm I'm I'm eating
[06:51] currently both probably a little bit
[06:53] more plers but uh I like both of them so
[06:56] it's it's it's interesting how religious
[06:58] people are about they eat uh if if you
[07:01] just stick to the basis you of no
[07:02] processed foods and stuff like that like
[07:04] you can easily be a really healthy human
[07:07] being no matter if you go with a
[07:09] plant-based or with carnivore uh so like
[07:12] processed foods and and sugar and too
[07:14] much salt and all those those things if
[07:16] you avoid that you probably better than
[07:18] 95% of the people yeah and I mean that
[07:21] that goes somewhat in the direction of
[07:23] of your question right you you asked
[07:24] would you would you define bitcoiners
[07:26] more to be drawn towards the beef
[07:28] Direction I I think it has to do with
[07:30] these simple useful practical things in
[07:33] life and that is you know stack SATs um
[07:37] for the future GO train work out be
[07:39] smart uh train not only your body but
[07:42] your brain um and then eat food that is
[07:45] good for you and um you just said it
[07:47] it's it's easier or it's very easy to
[07:50] align on what kind of food is bad for us
[07:54] um and then you know after we all agreed
[07:57] well processed food a ref at sugar and
[08:01] um alcohol and and multiple other things
[08:04] are bad for us um and then I think
[08:06] there's a a group of things a group of
[08:09] foods that are good for us and for some
[08:12] it is it may be um plant-based protein
[08:15] chick bees and so forth others may not
[08:17] digest that so well and for them it's
[08:18] more meat beef um and for for the next
[08:21] one it may be fish so I think there's
[08:24] you know there's this one thing that we
[08:26] can agree on and that is uh Fiat food
[08:28] has been sing us making us fat stupid
[08:31] and lame and then there is this um other
[08:34] group of foods which which which is good
[08:36] for us for our bodies which human beings
[08:37] have been eating over millions of years
[08:39] and so um I think that's where we are
[08:42] but what I wanted to touch Bas touch on
[08:45] though is when you when you ask so you
[08:47] like how these things um um meet
[08:50] together or fit together like the
[08:51] circular economy basically and I think
[08:53] this is the future of of Bitcoin and
[08:55] Bitcoin mining and and and also the um
[08:58] um other Industries as well putting
[09:01] multiple businesses together and
[09:02] multiple uh value streams coming
[09:05] together and and and basically
[09:06] benefiting each other and for us like J
[09:09] and I were standing there yesterday when
[09:10] we when you know when we're going
[09:12] through this first process of you know
[09:14] choosing the right beef choosing the
[09:15] right seasoning mixing it all up
[09:17] preparing the whole like uh production
[09:20] um um process and then you know thinking
[09:23] every little bit through um and and it's
[09:27] just so fascinating we're building our
[09:29] data centers we're producing the money
[09:32] that we believe in and then at the same
[09:34] time it creates the energy to create our
[09:37] own food and we basically realized we
[09:41] have for pre gym exercise we have sugar
[09:47] like Rich fruit fruit sugar um um
[09:50] mangoes to eat then go to the gym
[09:53] afterwards come from a workout get some
[09:56] beef jerky um you know what else do we
[09:59] need we got Bitcoin we got the workouts
[10:02] and we got our own food production um so
[10:05] that that's pretty cool there's one more
[10:06] thing that I want to add at one point
[10:08] and that is uh clean water with the heat
[10:10] or at least use it as an uh you know uh
[10:13] as a as a as a starting point to get the
[10:16] water to a certain temperature and then
[10:17] boil it from there to um to to to you
[10:20] know turn um water into drink fresh
[10:23] drinking water again and then you have
[10:25] everything you have your own money you
[10:27] have your own food and you have your own
[10:28] water that then you're absolutely
[10:30] independent and I think that's that's
[10:32] the sovereignity that that many
[10:33] bitcoiners also want I love that um
[10:36] maybe let's uh start with the basics um
[10:40] what is screen mining Dow as it's on on
[10:42] your T-shirt also and what are you doing
[10:44] there uh to understand the whole project
[10:46] better maybe maybe yeah thank you for
[10:48] asking well um we're we're the first
[10:52] decentralized Bitcoin mining Dow on a
[10:54] planet um that that really focused on
[10:57] not Distributing hash rate or
[10:59] Distributing miners but rather allowing
[11:02] investors to become part of um actual
[11:04] physical Bitcoin mining data centers and
[11:08] we're a swiss-based entity um operating
[11:11] now for um three three three and some
[11:14] years so we incorporated in
[11:16] 2022 and um this company basically arose
[11:20] from the from from the vision and idea
[11:22] to build a product that is um um for
[11:26] investors that only can or want to put
[11:28] small amounts
[11:30] um into into Bitcoin mining and and not
[11:33] necessarily have a million 2 million 3
[11:35] million or 10 to build their own sites
[11:38] uh and still be profitable you so
[11:39] there's multiple Solutions out there for
[11:42] investors with a th000 10,000 or
[11:45] $20,000 um where they can buy a few
[11:47] Miners and let them H let them host by
[11:49] certain host in a certain location um
[11:52] and and very often they pay high premium
[11:54] on the electricity price on the price
[11:57] for the machines and um they're
[12:00] basically not in full control when
[12:03] volatility of Bitcoin price and network
[12:05] hash rate or in total the the the hash
[12:08] price index kind of kicks in so they are
[12:10] constantly paying the host the host is
[12:12] making money the the investor is going
[12:14] broke after certain while very quickly
[12:16] and very often they turnovers very quick
[12:18] so long story short our idea was um
[12:21] create a product where um the the
[12:23] initiator of the project and investors
[12:25] are aligned um and and have the same
[12:28] interest and are incentivized the same
[12:29] way and that's what we do so it's really
[12:31] a value forv value um approach where we
[12:35] we find energy on on all over the planet
[12:38] in in multiple locations that is um
[12:40] ideally Hydro wind or solar uh we set up
[12:43] shop and and and kind of build data
[12:45] centers between six and 10 megawatt each
[12:48] of these data centers currently
[12:49] operating in Paraguay there's news
[12:51] coming in the in the near future about
[12:53] our second continent being launched um
[12:56] and and and the goal is really to be all
[12:58] over the the the globe um within the
[13:01] next four years we we we set these data
[13:04] centers up um owned by a Swiss entity
[13:07] every entity or every data center has
[13:09] its own entity and then investors can
[13:11] you know see these different
[13:12] opportunities maybe one in Paraguay the
[13:15] other one in the US and Croatia um or
[13:18] somewhere in Africa and all of these
[13:20] sites would have a different energy
[13:22] price different energy source and
[13:24] potentially a different combination of
[13:27] another business going into it yeah d
[13:29] mango dried beef jerky dried houses in
[13:32] Scandinavia um and the and and then also
[13:35] different size some maybe Hydro some may
[13:37] be air cooled so you can basically
[13:40] combine or or every site has its own
[13:42] individual characteristics such as every
[13:45] Airbnb that you're visiting sometimes
[13:47] you're snowboarding or skiing and you
[13:48] get something in the Alps and sometimes
[13:50] you want to go to the beach in Mexico
[13:52] and you just get a beach hut so like
[13:54] these airbnbs have different
[13:55] characteristics the data centers have
[13:57] different characteristics and you may
[13:59] want to own a few shares here in in in
[14:02] Paraguay want May own a few shares in
[14:04] Ethiopia uh and a few shares in Croatia
[14:07] or the United States and thereby mix
[14:08] your own portfolio of Bitcoin mining
[14:10] stock and that's basically what we're
[14:13] enabling so investors can buy into a
[14:15] specific data center own stock in that
[14:17] specific Data Center and then they
[14:20] receive um um Bitcoin dividends on a
[14:23] quarterly basis so we pay out the
[14:25] dividends of that data center but in
[14:27] Bitcoin um and and and that's what we
[14:31] what we're enabling or and this is how
[14:32] we're enabling our shareholders to
[14:34] receive um an average 20% annual return
[14:38] of invest uh but not by some owning only
[14:42] a machine or two or owning a certain
[14:44] hash rate that declines in valuation but
[14:46] by owning a stock in a company that
[14:48] consistently grows its hash rate and and
[14:51] consistently grows its operation and
[14:53] it's combined with a
[14:55] volatility um um flattening business
[14:58] such as the drying business model which
[15:00] is supposed to earn between 15 and 30%
[15:03] additional revenues to cover their
[15:04] energy cost which takes out the
[15:06] volatility yeah that so that that's the
[15:09] core basically and that's where the you
[15:10] know the green comes obviously from the
[15:12] renewable energy and the ReUse of heat
[15:14] the circular economy effectively making
[15:16] every data center a CO NE CO2 negative
[15:20] um U facility basically reducing more
[15:23] CO2 than it is producing um then the the
[15:26] mining we're only doing Bitcoin mining
[15:28] and and and nothing else we're not into
[15:30] clown coins or shitcoins we're just
[15:32] literally producing Bitcoin and and and
[15:35] literally we can say Financial Freedom
[15:37] has never tasted so sweet yeah as
[15:39] mentioned before and and the Dow
[15:41] perspective really comes from every
[15:43] single side that we're building is um is
[15:47] is set up in a way that we only own a
[15:50] minority stack in it while the investors
[15:53] own the majority stack of 80% inside of
[15:56] even every Data Center and they have
[15:59] class A shares which allow them to vote
[16:02] which allow them to receive dividends
[16:03] and and and participate in profits and
[16:06] um but obviously this is not a this is
[16:09] not a um a product sales or uh to to
[16:12] your listeners right now here I'm I'm
[16:14] not here to to sell um any very specific
[16:16] product um because for that um license
[16:19] and and um um Financial Authority um um
[16:24] confirmations are are necessary uh
[16:27] depending on the on the specific country
[16:28] that we're right now we're only
[16:30] operating um or we we're basically
[16:32] allowing shareholders to participate in
[16:35] in Switzerland um um and professional
[16:38] investors from of a certain of a certain
[16:41] level
[16:43] um but we're aiming to to launch these
[16:46] products in in multiple countries all
[16:48] over the world that's super interesting
[16:50] yeah it kind of It kind of opens up the
[16:52] question of like uh we we have now
[16:55] Bitcoin as this decentralized um
[16:58] monetary tool but then uh will the
[17:01] companies always be organized in that
[17:04] traditional stock market s thing and I
[17:07] think dowo has especially with Bitcoin
[17:09] has really bad connotation like a lot of
[17:12] people connected with like altcoins as
[17:13] you said clown coins shitcoins that just
[17:16] try to sell you some scam um but for
[17:19] those who maybe don't know what what is
[17:21] a DA in general and and uh what are you
[17:24] trying to do that with with that
[17:26] organization so I mean in general the
[17:28] Dow then for decentralized autonomous
[17:30] organization um meaning mostly an
[17:33] organization that is organized just on
[17:35] the blockchain and has no real world
[17:37] assets necessarily or um no no physical
[17:41] Goods um what we do and have is we we
[17:45] own physical data centers and they are
[17:48] organized in uh Real World swiss-based
[17:50] Companies and therefore we cannot be
[17:53] totally um um decentralized and totally
[17:56] autonomous yeah that that I think is a
[17:58] first very important information um but
[18:01] what we do is we basically Define or we
[18:04] creating our own definition of Dao and
[18:07] decentralized autonomous organization
[18:09] and what we do is um we're we're
[18:12] decentralizing and and democratizing
[18:15] access to an asset class that usually
[18:18] wouldn't be available to shareholders in
[18:20] that type and form now people can go and
[18:22] buy Marathon Riot and other stocks of
[18:25] Bitcoin miners in in on on the stock
[18:27] exchange but they won't see any Bitcoin
[18:30] dividend payouts um um as of now yeah
[18:33] there's a few that have been mentioning
[18:35] that they're going to or they're trying
[18:37] to or they want to they may do it but so
[18:40] far um no one has has has really um paid
[18:43] their their shareholders in in Bitcoin
[18:46] dividends and that's something that that
[18:48] we that we wanted to change and that we
[18:49] do because our priority is not to
[18:52] accumulate vth inside of that company
[18:54] but rather distribute the profits um and
[18:57] 100% of the profits which means we have
[18:58] revenues we have costs we take a certain
[19:01] um reinvestment amount um to to
[19:03] basically cover the depreciation of the
[19:05] machines and reinvest it constantly to
[19:07] grow the facility side but then the rest
[19:09] is being paid out um fully and us as as
[19:13] as operating entity green mining Dow we
[19:15] don't take a cut on the energy we don't
[19:17] take a cut on the operations we do
[19:18] everything as at Cost because our
[19:20] business model is we we also own 20% of
[19:23] each Data Center and that's only the way
[19:25] that we're making money so if our
[19:27] investors make dividend we make
[19:29] dividends as well and that's how we
[19:30] align the the interests of of of these
[19:32] so the general Dow aspect is put
[19:36] something on chain Define rules and Let
[19:38] It Go automatically um and then maybe
[19:41] once in a while get the community to
[19:43] vote our interpretation of a DA is set
[19:46] set up a Swiss based entity don't have
[19:49] the majority stake and say but structure
[19:52] it in a way that uh shareholders have a
[19:55] absolute um say with their voting power
[19:58] uh they have the same profit
[20:00] participation rights as we do no one is
[20:03] um U like all would say no one is is
[20:05] more equal um but we're all the same
[20:08] equal and then we we literally how we
[20:11] execute it is we have quarterly uh
[20:13] General meetings not annual General
[20:15] meetings every quarter we're giving a
[20:18] financial overview um over the site to
[20:20] all of our shareholders with full
[20:22] transparency we Define the uh explicit
[20:25] profit there's wallets um that you know
[20:27] hold Electric cost have depreciation
[20:30] cost and the profits to be paid out so
[20:32] the transparency is there and then on a
[20:34] quarterly basis these shareholders can
[20:36] also vote on directions um so we as a
[20:39] board um are operating the the general
[20:42] business and um managing the business
[20:44] and if there is uh strategic votes such
[20:47] as do we want to
[20:50] um
[20:52] um do we want to um reinvest more of the
[20:56] profits into machines or do we want to
[20:59] stick to our plans to uh pay out 100%
[21:02] dividends those are votes that we're
[21:04] bringing to the community or the
[21:05] community brings to us and that we allow
[21:07] them to vote on and then we as a board
[21:09] will have an opinion and also share our
[21:11] opinion um and and but eventually we'll
[21:15] uh listen to what the shareholders say
[21:16] and what they want and and then follow
[21:18] the shareholder votes which are official
[21:20] votes now how do we do them uh we're
[21:22] actually tokenizing um our sites on
[21:25] bitcoin uh using ta addet so um
[21:29] users have one Bitcoin wallet in which
[21:31] they receive shares tokenized shares and
[21:34] that works with um a special set of
[21:36] Swiss um legal framework um but
[21:39] eventually it's a real world asset
[21:42] tokenized on bitcoin using tapate assets
[21:45] which allows users to hold the shares in
[21:46] their Bitcoin wallet and then on a
[21:48] quarterly basis also receive the Bitcoin
[21:50] dividends into their wallet so
[21:52] effectively one day you only need um one
[21:54] wallet that uh grants you access over
[21:58] your stock in Bitcoin mining companies
[22:00] as well as receiving the the actual
[22:02] dividends on there nothing else needed
[22:04] no bank account
[22:05] needed I love that it's it's really cool
[22:09] so so you actually have the stocks um
[22:13] what kind of a like the stocks are a
[22:16] legal entity basically in Switzerland
[22:18] and but you can uh directly own them in
[22:22] uh a wallet with Tapo assets it's this
[22:25] is probably not in all of the world
[22:28] possibly Switzerland is probably like
[22:29] one of the few countries where it's it's
[22:31] possible yeah there's only very few
[22:33] countries that um you know are already
[22:35] set up in a way to um to give the right
[22:39] environment for digital companies yeah
[22:42] and I mean with digital I really mean
[22:44] kind of more blockchain and and not you
[22:47] know digital decentralized companies um
[22:50] you I think there's four or five right
[22:52] now um including Switzerland that have a
[22:55] legal framework that says the board of
[22:58] directors can create or can issue stock
[23:02] on a token on a blockchain there's very
[23:04] specific criteria of how you can do it
[23:07] and and and what you what you need to
[23:09] follow up to do it but there's only so
[23:11] many places allowing that yes then you
[23:14] need a few other things like can do
[23:16] digital General meetings yeah um that's
[23:19] also not possible in every country you
[23:21] need some things like um um voting can
[23:25] happen digitally and doesn't have to
[23:27] happen in physical form or sending a
[23:29] letter um you have to have the rights to
[23:32] do uh uh dividend distributions more
[23:35] often than uh than annually because we
[23:37] wouldn't want to have our shareholders
[23:39] wait for the Bitcoin dividends on an
[23:41] like you know for a year or so so
[23:43] there's multiple things that that need
[23:44] to be in place and Switzerland is um a
[23:48] fantastic place for that there a is a
[23:50] great
[23:52] um um what is it for
[23:55] writer in in English for uh leader for
[23:59] leader I don't know it's it's a
[24:02] difficult I'm also not that English
[24:04] expert unfortunately free riter
[24:08] yeah if we want to make this word
[24:10] up uh interesting um there's so much in
[24:15] there uh first of all I think uh the
[24:17] discussion of like how uh companies in
[24:20] the future will organize themselves and
[24:23] crowdfund and and have people
[24:26] participate on on their profits and div
[24:28] Ence is super interesting because we
[24:31] have okay Bitcoin as that monetary Tool
[24:36] uh but then we have the whole stock and
[24:38] Company uh which is still and maybe it's
[24:42] not a bad thing maybe it's it's it's
[24:44] okay to have it that way because it's
[24:46] companies always has centralized
[24:49] headquarter there are always people
[24:50] involved you know the people uh and and
[24:53] you also have to prevent fraud and stuff
[24:55] like that I don't know if that's if if
[24:57] how stocks in the future will be traded
[25:00] if this is maybe a future model where we
[25:02] actually have stocks on bitcoin uh or if
[25:07] that's just like an an outlier model
[25:09] where some in some use cases it makes
[25:11] sense I I actually think that this is
[25:13] where the world is moving towards and um
[25:16] again like you will be able to trade our
[25:18] uh like the stock of gm3 our our our
[25:21] latest site which is the third site that
[25:22] we're building here in Paraguay
[25:23] currently on a construction two
[25:25] megawatts alive out of six um
[25:28] I you will be able to trade that on
[25:30] bitcoin um uh in the middle of the year
[25:33] so I think and I think there's more
[25:35] going that direction I mean we see um
[25:38] rwa um as as this big shiny you know
[25:42] next thing um everywhere I think every
[25:45] second clown coin is currently um
[25:47] tagging rwa to them and I know that some
[25:49] bitcoiners are not a fan of tokenization
[25:52] this and that but I think that the world
[25:54] is moving towards that because the the
[25:57] the technology of tokenizing something
[25:59] allows you to cut out intermediat and
[26:03] and and decrease the length of the um
[26:06] individuals within the value chain
[26:09] taking a cut which eventually makes it
[26:10] cheaper for the end user um so
[26:13] tokenization in itself um is not a bad
[26:16] thing I believe it is a uh it's a uh
[26:20] it's an innovation and an optimization
[26:22] of processes the question is how do we
[26:24] use it and and and what is it used for
[26:27] do we use a token just to speculate and
[26:30] hope and think that clown coin Mumu coin
[26:33] poo coin whatever they all called are
[26:35] appreciating in price because another
[26:37] idiot is willing to pay more than I am
[26:39] um or are we actually just um using a
[26:44] token to represent the value of
[26:45] something that has value no matter what
[26:48] so if you look at stocks they they're
[26:50] not like obviously there's some fantasy
[26:52] and some interpretation of price and
[26:54] business in there as well so not all the
[26:56] the price has you know interest iic
[26:58] value but um eventually it's what the
[27:01] market is willing to pay for an asset
[27:04] that has value um and and and you see
[27:06] the price appreciate or depreciate on on
[27:08] an exchange and the same happens for a
[27:11] token that is representing a share of a
[27:14] company that is producing something that
[27:16] has a value because it creates profit
[27:19] and you can calculate the net present
[27:21] value of the um the the profit streams
[27:24] over the next 10 years you know um um
[27:29] reduced by a um 10% annual um um a risk
[27:34] risk um risk percentage down to the Net
[27:36] Present Value um and yeah and so now I'm
[27:41] I'm getting a little bit lost but to get
[27:44] to your to your point I think that
[27:45] tokenization is some is is is something
[27:48] that is um valuable and worthwhile to
[27:50] stay and um doing it on bitcoin as a
[27:53] extremely secure irrevocable um
[27:56] distributed Ledger at extra security and
[27:59] if you can do it in a way that you're
[28:01] not trading on NASDAQ nice and so forth
[28:03] where 7even in meters are taking a cut
[28:05] every single time you're trading and
[28:06] therefore you're ending up with
[28:08] somewhere between 1 and 3% of trading
[28:10] fee if you could do it on chain and
[28:12] you're ending up with 0.1 or even less
[28:15] that that's an absolute Innovation and
[28:16] Improvement for retail investors because
[28:18] it allows asset classes with lower cap
[28:21] market cap to get onto these um on onto
[28:24] these um um you know into into into area
[28:28] or into tap into oh nice tap into um um
[28:34] tap into liquidity into a market that
[28:36] that usually couldn't access these these
[28:37] asset classes right and then of course
[28:40] um protection shareholder protection is
[28:41] extremely important which is also why I
[28:44] think um you know DA has such a negative
[28:47] connotation because it hasn't been
[28:49] connected with real world entities it
[28:51] hasn't given the shareholders the um
[28:55] protection the shareholder protection
[28:56] that they should have gotten
[28:58] um and therefore hundreds or thousands
[29:01] of people or hundreds hundred thousands
[29:02] of people have lost um a lot of money
[29:05] now in our case and the way that we and
[29:08] also a few others are interpret
[29:09] interpretating this this whole dowo
[29:11] concept and giving it um
[29:13] a um legal backbone by adding um a real
[29:18] world entity means there's people as
[29:21] board of directors that are actually
[29:23] taking accountability for the um
[29:25] activities and actions that company's
[29:27] taking so I have a public phas I'm doxed
[29:30] I'm out there I am doing stuff and I'm
[29:32] doing it in the best interest of uh our
[29:34] shareholders and our our our data
[29:37] centers um and and and we're doing it
[29:41] within a certain set of legal rules and
[29:45] regulations um which allows the
[29:47] shareholder to be very aware of okay um
[29:51] who is my um counterparty who are the
[29:54] individuals that are behind a certain
[29:56] activity and and and and and also
[29:58] there's you know public registers
[30:00] corporate Registries that that show the
[30:02] entities share Capital that Define the
[30:05] articles of Association um that you know
[30:08] with a shareholder agreement it's very
[30:10] clear what are the shareholders um um
[30:12] bound to expect and so I think this
[30:15] there is spec there's rules regulations
[30:17] and setups in this world that allowed us
[30:19] to thrive and build companies and create
[30:21] value and I don't think that all of it
[30:24] is bad um so it's more a question of how
[30:27] do we bring these functioning structures
[30:29] of for example um um corporate entities
[30:33] or or you know uh limited companies onto
[30:36] onto the next level of of of our
[30:38] financial system including Bitcoin I
[30:42] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[30:45] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[30:48] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[30:51] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[30:53] vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch
[30:57] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[31:00] go out there and show that you are a
[31:02] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[31:05] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[31:08] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:11] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:13] collections you have the date of the
[31:16] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[31:19] and of course also the block height and
[31:22] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[31:25] level of detail they put in in this
[31:28] Masterpiece and make sure to check out
[31:30] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:33] down in the descriptions I love those
[31:36] watches so so much if you watch or
[31:39] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:41] I'll guess you already bought some
[31:43] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[31:46] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[31:49] in a hardware wallet my personal
[31:51] recommendation for hardw wallet is the
[31:53] bit box it's super secure it's simple to
[31:56] set up it's also perfect a gift for a
[31:58] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[32:01] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[32:05] with the code Robin at the checkout
[32:07] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[32:11] your bitbox and the next step is to
[32:13] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:16] individual you have to have the most
[32:18] secure self- custody setup you have to
[32:21] secure your own devices you have to
[32:23] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:26] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:29] where you live you even want to have a
[32:31] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:34] in case something goes really really
[32:36] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:38] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:41] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[32:43] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[32:47] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[32:50] how you can level up your sovereignty
[32:53] that's amazing yeah it the the point
[32:56] that you made earlier was was amazing
[32:57] because it it kind of opens up a small
[33:00] company to uh the global uh liquidity
[33:04] Market the global money market or
[33:06] however you want to call it because we
[33:09] know currently if you have a private
[33:11] company the step to being a public
[33:13] company comes with obviously a lot of
[33:16] headaches also but with a huge advantage
[33:19] of being uh globally available and
[33:22] having access to a huge Capital Market
[33:25] uh if you can open that Capital Market
[33:28] uh from an earlier stage or from a from
[33:30] the very starting maybe even uh to a
[33:33] company with that you make the the the
[33:38] competition to the best idea more open
[33:41] uh because you have smaller companies
[33:44] competing with the bigger ones on a on a
[33:46] equal playing field as as I understand
[33:48] it that's really really cool actually
[33:51] yeah yeah maybe not yet the equal
[33:53] playing field because they have like
[33:55] obviously big Brands big names more
[33:57] access ACC to Capital more distribution
[33:59] channels y y y but it it it it at least
[34:03] opens up the the target audience that
[34:06] usually goes and buys their stock on on
[34:09] on nice or or wherever
[34:12] um they can all of a sudden buy bonds
[34:16] shares or other Financial um um
[34:19] offerings um from smaller companies yeah
[34:21] I I absolutely agree now obviously
[34:24] there's uh there there's two more things
[34:25] that need to come with it and that is
[34:26] again shareholder prot protection in a
[34:28] in a in a useful sense because
[34:31] eventually you know it's I think it's
[34:32] important that human beings are
[34:34] protected from fraud um and that it's
[34:36] made hard for you know uh entities
[34:39] companies to rip off individuals on the
[34:42] other hand it should be our uh natural
[34:45] humans accountability to use our brain
[34:48] and and and do the basic analysis yeah
[34:50] obviously not dive deep into every
[34:52] single business that we may or may not
[34:54] invest in and understand every single
[34:56] process and and and and correlation
[34:58] between rules and regulations I think
[35:01] this is where we need protection but in
[35:04] regards of making a decision well or not
[35:06] I want to go leverage long or this and
[35:08] that I think there's there's um a
[35:12] certain certain accountability that we
[35:14] should all have and um um instead of you
[35:18] know adding more Authority
[35:21] and author uh um more authority to
[35:26] control and and basically tell me
[35:28] whether or not to go left or right um so
[35:30] I think every human being should be in
[35:31] the position and also have the right to
[35:33] make their decisions um um yeah based on
[35:37] that so I think it's a thin line between
[35:39] between the um
[35:42] between regulation controlling access
[35:45] and and freedom um and the second thing
[35:47] that I think we still are a couple light
[35:51] years away from is the administrative
[35:54] processes for Capital increase um notary
[35:58] processes registration processes and so
[36:00] for I mean Switzerland is already quite
[36:02] quite Progressive and fast with that
[36:04] many things can happen digital um we now
[36:07] after the fourth Capital
[36:09] increase um with the same process know
[36:12] how it goes what to do where to go and
[36:14] so forth um but I remember the first
[36:17] time man that took like uh I think three
[36:19] quarters of a year to execute that
[36:21] because multiple shareholders um you
[36:23] need to get multiple signatures and
[36:26] documents and lists and this and that
[36:27] and um if you if you're not prepared for
[36:30] that and if you don't do that regularly
[36:31] or if you don't have um um a good lawyer
[36:34] and and notary supporting you with that
[36:36] um you're you're you're spending a
[36:38] shitload of money you're taking um
[36:40] dozens of weeks to to get everything
[36:42] together and you're most likely
[36:44] communicating with your
[36:45] shareholders um endless times and and
[36:48] these three things will take all the
[36:49] time in the world from you um from your
[36:53] from the time that you need to operate
[36:54] your business right so that that's the
[36:57] that's a that's the other thing that I
[36:58] think is it needs to it needs it needs
[37:01] some improvement um and it needs um
[37:05] governance um updates and and
[37:07] optimization so that companies can
[37:10] actually make use of these um Finance
[37:14] 3.0 uh Innovation such as tokenization
[37:17] fundraising on on chain and so forth
[37:19] because the fundraising process is one
[37:21] thing but then how do you translate that
[37:23] into the old world into you know um um
[37:27] offering these bonds or offering the
[37:29] stock or doing convertible loans and
[37:31] then converting them or doing Capital
[37:33] increases and and so there's a whole
[37:36] whole other world behind that that that
[37:39] that still needs some upgrading until um
[37:42] this will be super
[37:44] seamless absolutely yeah it's how long
[37:48] uh did it take you to to set the legal
[37:50] framework for for all this up it sounds
[37:52] like a lot of paperwork and a lot of
[37:55] long processes with the governments
[37:58] yes you know effectively we started the
[38:00] company on in in February
[38:03] 22 um but we're already that's green
[38:06] mining Dow The Entity GM data centers AG
[38:09] um that then you know
[38:11] finally um executed or is executing the
[38:14] model that we're doing now but we
[38:16] already Incorporated the initial uh um
[38:20] organization more than a year ago U more
[38:22] than a year before that uh starting end
[38:24] of
[38:25] 20 or yeah starting in in 21 is when we
[38:29] actually started with with Mining and
[38:31] and and and know setting up the legal
[38:35] framework eventually it took us about
[38:37] two and a half years to really get to
[38:40] the final conclusion of how do we want
[38:43] to do it what the processes are how all
[38:45] the documents look like um and and we're
[38:48] now in a position to kind of rinse and
[38:52] repeat um but it took us around two and
[38:55] a half years and yes it took a lot of
[38:57] investment
[38:58] absolutely that's uh super also the the
[39:01] the discussion around um I'm absolute
[39:04] free market maximalist so like if if it
[39:07] just comes to me like everything could
[39:08] be free we we can uh like I kind of
[39:11] shifted actually in the last half Year
[39:13] to one year I I was one year ago quite a
[39:17] hater on shitcoins I still own no
[39:20] altcoins at all uh I still think they
[39:23] are all
[39:24] useless but I'm more proud to like let's
[39:27] let's have them compete like they they
[39:29] will suffer and and people will learn
[39:31] the lesson so like uh the free market
[39:33] should rule that and I should not have
[39:37] the I should not be the one saying like
[39:39] oh we we should the the SEC should go
[39:42] against them uh that that's kind of not
[39:45] the free market uh it's it's also now
[39:49] with with Donald Trump
[39:50] and the president of the United States
[39:53] pushing his own altcoin I don't think
[39:55] it's a good idea for him I think it will
[39:57] be probably bad on his on his repetition
[40:00] repetition at some point I mean may
[40:02] maybe not because if he do does good
[40:04] things for Bitcoin people don't remember
[40:06] the bad stuff but uh the free market
[40:10] will will sort this out I'm I'm I'm
[40:12] really big on on the free market so as
[40:14] long as everyone can compete for a fair
[40:19] share and there's no Monopoly building
[40:21] and stuff like that as long as there's a
[40:23] a fair frame around the things I think
[40:26] then we don't have
[40:27] a problem and I do hope that the access
[40:31] to Capital markets and to smaller
[40:33] companies is is way way better like IM
[40:36] imagine you could invest in small
[40:39] Bitcoin startups really easily uh that
[40:42] you anyways um use like if you use like
[40:46] an an an an offramp where you can pay
[40:49] like um because it just started with
[40:51] their debit card bring in like few days
[40:54] ago I I saw them how amazing would it be
[40:57] like oh like it's a great great product
[40:59] let's buy some shares like let's put
[41:00] like a 100 Euros in there just to see
[41:03] and profit from that I think that would
[41:04] be amazing to see the the the free open
[41:08] market uh to see and the best idea
[41:11] should win I think that that's a that's
[41:12] a great point that you made I think
[41:15] you're seeing this all over the place
[41:17] right um the launch of tokenized real
[41:20] estate um of of um other tokenized
[41:23] Financial assets has already uh taken
[41:26] place or is taking place
[41:27] um you you can go out excuse me you can
[41:30] go out there and find multiple platforms
[41:32] today and multiple real estate projects
[41:34] in which you could buy a few shares and
[41:36] we're going to be the player that um
[41:38] basically allows that for Bitcoin mining
[41:39] or we are um and and and this year is
[41:42] going to be extremely exciting because
[41:44] as you rightfully said so the last
[41:45] couple years we're building uh it was
[41:47] especially during the bare Market times
[41:49] when when multiple participants in this
[41:51] market is like ah no Bitcoin is dead and
[41:54] everything else as well um and now
[41:56] they're all back and we like ah crazy no
[41:58] we need to jump on the train uh we're
[42:00] willing to pay three times the price but
[42:02] now we believe it um at least until the
[42:04] next drop um and there I think there was
[42:07] a lot of um development done
[42:10] specifically in this last bear cycle or
[42:12] bur bear uh phase I haven't seen so much
[42:15] in the two cycles before um and and it's
[42:19] it's really exciting what is out there
[42:21] um from a technology perspective we're
[42:23] capable of doing um um what you just
[42:25] described and and some are doing it and
[42:28] I think there is um some some governance
[42:30] being done um and Improvement on the
[42:33] legal side in in some countries that are
[42:37] um that are
[42:40] um engaging or fostering or um but but
[42:43] giving the the right environment because
[42:45] they see the opportunity for that but I
[42:48] do think it will take a couple more
[42:49] years until this is a standard globally
[42:52] because every nation will go differently
[42:53] about it and um yeah we'll we'll see how
[42:58] how how countries are um how countries
[43:02] who are M what is the word I'm I'm
[43:04] looking for this word sorry it's it's
[43:06] you can sense that I haven't slept so
[43:08] well and uh that my brain is not
[43:10] functioning a on 100% uh it doesn't have
[43:13] all the hash rate yet um it's still you
[43:15] know the the the minor is still uh going
[43:20] up um I think I think it's going to
[43:24] happen and um we're extremely excited
[43:26] about our solution because it allows
[43:29] shareholders to really you know let me
[43:31] put 10K here in uh in Paraguay and and
[43:34] get a 20% dividend let me also put um a
[43:39] a 15K 20K into Ethiopia where I can get
[43:42] a uh 25% dividend but um and and and one
[43:46] dries me mangoes the other one drives me
[43:48] beef and maybe I want to put a little
[43:50] bit Into 5K into a Scandinavian uh site
[43:53] that that produces me uh 18% uh and and
[43:57] I put another 50k into a Texas site that
[44:01] is um you know um balancing the grid and
[44:05] making sure that when uh storms hit or
[44:08] energy is needed we turn off and and and
[44:10] modulate and therefore make another
[44:12] Revenue Stream So I think that's going
[44:13] to happen and um I think people will
[44:16] just use the the Bitcoin technology
[44:19] which we now can yeah we're very slow
[44:20] over a couple years and seeing all the
[44:22] shitcoins develop with smart contracts
[44:25] and so forth but eventually you can do
[44:27] um very similar things on bitcoin uh due
[44:29] to recent up upgrades um not recent but
[44:34] but more than a year now ago um but and
[44:38] I think this is going to be extremely
[44:39] exciting I mean you saw uh you see
[44:41] blockstream working on on on on
[44:43] Technologies on on Bitcoin now for a
[44:45] while um we saw usdc being launched on
[44:49] on on bitcoin I think two three four
[44:52] months ago maybe I think yesterday or
[44:54] two days ago or 3 days ago thata also
[44:57] released a video on saying we're now
[44:59] minting uh usdt on bitcoin so you see
[45:02] real world assets or assets go getting
[45:04] onto um onto Bitcoin using lightning
[45:08] making it rapidly fast to transfer super
[45:10] cheap to transfer but with the
[45:12] underlying security of Bitcoin and what
[45:15] I said in the beginning of the video I
[45:16] think that's also like that's a vision
[45:18] that is beautiful and I'm already uh
[45:20] super excited man imagine you know you
[45:23] have you have one wallet you can exit it
[45:27] is electrum or um Sparrow wallet and
[45:30] it's a it's a non-custodial wallet
[45:33] you're the owner you have it and it
[45:36] allows you to um to have stock of the
[45:40] companies that you that you like that
[45:41] you trade that you believe that you
[45:43] invest in in your wallet protected by
[45:47] your seat phrase your protection
[45:49] mechanism you're taking the
[45:51] accountability and that same wallet
[45:53] provides you with the the the dividends
[45:56] be it then in in in um tokenized Fiat
[45:59] usdt usdc um dividends or in Bitcoin
[46:03] dividends all in the same wallet and
[46:05] then you know you're going out for a
[46:07] coffee and you're just tapping again
[46:08] your phone and buying the coffee with 5
[46:11] usdt on bitcoin I think that's that's
[46:13] going to happen and and you're going to
[46:15] see more Maxis Rising because we don't
[46:17] need all the other infrastructure and
[46:19] networks with with that news upgrading
[46:21] technology and the Beautiful Thing is
[46:23] What's Happening Now is it makes it
[46:25] simple so not only makes it secure not
[46:27] only is it the The One and Only Solution
[46:29] in my opinion but also it now starts to
[46:33] become easy and seamless so we're now
[46:35] seeing that next wave in my opinion
[46:38] where ux and usability gets uh um um a
[46:42] relevant say and a relevant um um
[46:45] position in um in in in in our industry
[46:49] which is important to adopt masses and
[46:51] and to bring masses online yeah and
[46:53] eventually they won't necessarily care
[46:55] and you will probably even see people
[46:56] Trading tokenized stock or tokenized
[46:59] assets without knowing which blockchain
[47:01] it's on yeah they just see oh wow I can
[47:04] participating in this
[47:05] $500,000 house in in in in the
[47:09] Portuguese alav and it allows me to if I
[47:12] own 10% of it it allows me to go there
[47:15] five weeks of the year and if I don't go
[47:18] um a service rented out for me and I'm
[47:20] earning money on that and I'm just
[47:21] seeing the money popping into my wallet
[47:23] in on tokenized assets so you wouldn't
[47:26] you would necessarily be able to
[47:28] tokenize this or or to sell shares in
[47:30] smaller amounts on a on a on a you know
[47:33] exchange on a public available exchange
[47:35] with all the com uh with with all the
[47:38] companies in between taking a cut um it
[47:41] just wouldn't be profitable it wouldn't
[47:42] be doable to operate but with automated
[47:44] processes smart contracts and and
[47:46] basically digitizing multiple of these
[47:48] processes which we can and then tokenize
[47:51] the information with which we also can
[47:53] with blockchain and then add the legal
[47:55] component to it that really says says
[47:57] okay real estate can be tokenized like
[47:59] that or the real estate is owned by an
[48:01] entity that is tokenized like that you
[48:03] all of a sudden have all the puzzle
[48:04] pieces that allow you to bring these
[48:06] small cap assets into into the digital
[48:09] world and allow people to actually own a
[48:10] part of it I think it will have a huge
[48:12] impact on the distribution of wealth in
[48:15] a different way than we have seen it
[48:17] before because all of a sudden it really
[48:19] democratizes access to certain assets be
[48:21] it real estate be at companies or be at
[48:23] Bitcoin mining data centers in in
[48:25] regions that many people would never put
[48:28] foot at or you know and never never
[48:30] really visit that and all of a sudden
[48:31] they can even access um uh shares in
[48:34] those companies properly run
[48:36] professionally um um um executed and
[48:39] transparently
[48:40] led amazing it's kind of the the future
[48:45] where we we want things to be built on
[48:48] bitcoin it's kind of the the the theory
[48:50] of uh Bitcoin is a protocol which we
[48:54] then can use to build everything else on
[48:56] top top of it like the TCP protocol and
[49:00] we should not compare Bitcoin with with
[49:02] anything that is like I mean those are
[49:06] not bitcoiners but uh pre coiners that
[49:08] compare it to like Facebook or compare
[49:10] it to other things like that we we bitco
[49:12] is like the dcpip where everything uh on
[49:15] on top of it will be built and we're
[49:17] kind of only seeing the start of it like
[49:19] 15 years like it's it's no time like we
[49:21] we are kind of just doing the the first
[49:23] small use cases on on top of it that is
[49:25] really exciting
[49:27] I agree I absolutely agree with you man
[49:29] it's just like we have this
[49:31] decentralized database that is backed by
[49:34] the most powerful computer network on
[49:37] the planet and information that is
[49:40] basically inscribed into that blockchain
[49:43] is there forever irrevocable can't be
[49:46] changed and um and I think that just you
[49:49] know it gives so much room for
[49:52] Innovation for everything that needs
[49:54] trust and uh dur ability and
[49:58] Independence sanity and I I
[50:02] mean the coolest thing about our
[50:04] industry and what we do is it allows me
[50:06] and our team and I think everyone and
[50:08] you as well in the in the world that is
[50:11] working in that world to wake up every
[50:13] morning and be like yeah I'm actually
[50:15] doing something that will have real
[50:17] impact at least that's what makes me
[50:19] believe it's um it's like what we're
[50:23] doing here has the power to change so
[50:26] many things on the planet yeah I'm in I
[50:29] I have to be careful not to be put into
[50:31] this Camp of um oh yeah he says Bitcoin
[50:34] solves it all because I don't believe
[50:35] that Bitcoin can solve it all by itself
[50:38] but it actually puts the right um it it
[50:42] it allows us to think the right
[50:43] direction yeah um with its with its
[50:46] limited Supply okay think of scarcity
[50:49] and limited Supply differently with its
[50:51] um not your keys not your wallet slown
[50:54] your keys own your wallet it really
[50:56] Fosters accountability and Independence
[50:58] and self-thinking uh critical thinking
[51:01] and and and questioning yeah um with
[51:04] with the idea of um
[51:07] a uh proof of work you actually
[51:11] understand the concept of value for
[51:13] Value so there's so many rich and
[51:16] useful um messages for a sustainable
[51:20] intelligent and beautiful way of living
[51:23] creating a great society in this techn
[51:26] techology um and I have not seen any
[51:29] other technology or any other thing in
[51:31] the world that combines so many strong
[51:33] things so many strong messages all in
[51:36] one absolutely and we need the time to
[51:38] like build the the right Frameworks
[51:40] around it obviously I I think uh we
[51:42] could um kind of compare it to the early
[51:45] internets where people were really
[51:47] scared of buying anything online because
[51:50] there were a lot of scams and there were
[51:51] not the right Frameworks now it's kind
[51:53] of weird to not pay like I I I I need if
[51:58] I need something I go on Amazon I I
[51:59] don't even think about going to electric
[52:01] store or like I I now bought um a vacuum
[52:05] cleaner for for the house uh because I
[52:08] really I I cannot do this like I was
[52:11] like let's let's do a vacuum cleaner and
[52:13] like spy robot and they actually came
[52:15] today uh like an hour before the uh the
[52:18] this recording and it was is he already
[52:21] is he already cleaning in the background
[52:23] no no like it's it's still in the box I
[52:26] I have the exciting setup after the
[52:28] after this podcast I'm looking forward
[52:30] to that uh but it's it's it's really
[52:32] interesting because it was not even in
[52:33] my mind that I go to some local
[52:36] electronic store or something like that
[52:38] I was like I will go on YouTube to
[52:40] research and then I will see on Amazon
[52:42] all the reviews and then I click buy and
[52:45] it was uh 36 hours I think like that uh
[52:49] so like first evening I I bought it and
[52:52] Saturday morning it came like which is
[52:54] fascinating how quick it is
[52:57] it's it's here I don't need to go
[52:59] directly into I don't know a media
[53:01] Market in Austria or something like that
[53:04] and and buy directly like the the the
[53:07] the pace of change like the the the pace
[53:10] of the change was really quick from like
[53:12] we don't trust internet and it's like a
[53:14] niche thing of like 1% to like I don't
[53:16] want to do anything else like if I don't
[53:18] see the Amazon reviews I don't know what
[53:20] I'm buying I feel weird uh trusting the
[53:23] guy at the electronic store saying like
[53:26] oh the best vacuum cleaner like I don't
[53:28] know like if you're the expert in vacuum
[53:29] cleaners I know if I see a guy that
[53:32] makes on YouTube uh 200 videos on vacuum
[53:35] cleaners and and Compares them all and
[53:37] tests them all like he probably knows
[53:39] it's really good yeah no I mean what you
[53:42] eventually doing is you're making use of
[53:44] peer reviewed um um you know feedbacks
[53:48] or peer reviewed analysis and that's
[53:50] what eventually we don't have if we have
[53:52] a centralized assigned Authority in the
[53:55] vacuum store telling you this is the
[53:57] vacuumer yeah um actually it's a funny
[54:00] story that you say that you talk about
[54:02] vacuumer I think one and a half years
[54:04] ago or one year ago our vacuumer broke
[54:08] and I did go out to a vacuumer store ah
[54:11] because I wanted to get it fixed exactly
[54:13] it was a four v um vacuumer and I was
[54:16] like yeah man this these are th D mark
[54:19] back then um Let me let me try and get
[54:21] it fixed so I go there and he the guy I
[54:25] think to be very honest now that you
[54:27] that we're talking about it I think he
[54:28] lured me into buying this new vacuumer
[54:30] instead of trying to fix it he's like
[54:32] yeah no that that cost you more than
[54:35] buying a new one and this and that and
[54:37] so we I ended up not doing it oh nice
[54:39] glass by the way is that a
[54:42] mass yeah it's one liter it's like from
[54:45] Munich I was living there like a year or
[54:48] something like that it's since six years
[54:50] on my table and it's amazing because I
[54:53] uh I I need a lot of water because of I
[54:55] do a lot of podcast every day and so
[54:57] like uh I need a lot of water and I
[55:00] don't want to run to the kitchen all the
[55:01] time I understand and it it it trains
[55:04] your BPS too it's like
[55:06] yeah yeah it's it's like it's it's not
[55:08] that it's actually I I would not say
[55:11] heavy but it's it's definitely uh a lot
[55:14] more than your glass there yeah I have
[55:16] the I have the cute water glass here and
[55:19] know there's no wine in it there is just
[55:21] sparkling water but uh that's the fancy
[55:24] glass I got um so long story short I
[55:27] ended up buying a new vacuumer that was
[55:29] not cheap either um and I did believe
[55:33] him when he said yeah this is the cheap
[55:35] this is the best and he he also said
[55:38] this is a good price isn't that and I
[55:41] was actually very if I now remember I
[55:44] was emotionally very satisfied I was
[55:47] like yeah cool this is a competent guy
[55:49] he was describing to me XY and z um and
[55:52] I got home and I was sharing with
[55:54] Valentine hey look we got I got these I
[55:56] got two actually one normal vacuumer and
[55:58] one for um the you know the the the
[56:01] stuff that you want to do with the hand
[56:03] um like on the couch and so forth but
[56:05] then she's like did what why why did we
[56:08] need it uh and and and um have you
[56:11] checked if it's really the best the
[56:13] cheapest and so forth so I then went
[56:15] online looked for the same model found
[56:16] the same exact model for like I don't
[56:18] know 20% cheaper online so no matter if
[56:23] it's the best model or whatever but I
[56:24] ended up getting lured into buying a
[56:26] product for a higher price than if I
[56:29] could have bought it
[56:30] online by having someone telling me this
[56:33] is the perfect product so I basically
[56:35] now paid for a central a centralized
[56:38] Authority selling me the product they
[56:40] wanted to sell me instead of going
[56:43] online like you mentioned um getting
[56:46] peer reviews from hundreds of thousands
[56:48] of people on certain product reviews and
[56:51] and and just decide based on their
[56:53] feedback what I wanted So eventually I
[56:55] was lazy and I paid the price for that
[56:57] and uh it's it's like the transparency
[57:01] and the decentralization in the market
[57:03] makes all the difference it it it really
[57:06] makes uh if if everyone goes to Amazon
[57:09] uh reviews all of the sudden matter way
[57:12] more if everyone is like if if if you
[57:13] see how good it really is that that
[57:15] makes all I mean there's all the Bots
[57:18] that coming Amazon and that you pay for
[57:21] people that buy it and write a good
[57:23] reviews and all that stuff like there
[57:24] still there's still a lot of problem
[57:26] with those systems I'm not saying that
[57:28] that it's perfect but uh bringing more
[57:31] information and transparency in the
[57:32] market is always better I mean even here
[57:35] we could make the case that um if you
[57:38] had a um a public transparent Ledger
[57:41] that saves the information of the
[57:44] reviews such as where was it made um at
[57:48] least the IP address when was it made
[57:50] for what product and so forth so if you
[57:52] just had like in a very good overview
[57:54] that kind of data um you could very
[57:57] simply identify whether or not oh 10,000
[58:01] reviews were added in the time period of
[58:03] the first and the 7eventh of January and
[58:06] they all appeared on a product for 10
[58:07] cents for which the marketplace most
[58:10] likely get one cent So eventually they
[58:12] cost these 10,000 cost you a 100 bucks
[58:15] Yeah by paying a cent each so and they
[58:18] all have five stars and they all say
[58:21] product really good um you know it could
[58:24] be that um that that one then analyzes
[58:26] and understands well this could be fake
[58:29] and and maybe even flag it as such so if
[58:33] if it wasn't for Amazon but if it wasn't
[58:34] for a decentralized Marketplace that
[58:37] allowed reviews in a somewhat
[58:39] transparent um decentralized matter or
[58:42] um people people would be able to to
[58:44] flag it and understand it yeah so even
[58:46] there um again then the blockchain
[58:48] technology and and and and potentially
[58:51] even Bitcoin can support with that
[58:53] because it allows for um
[58:56] um reducing power of centralized
[58:59] entities yeah and I think this is also
[59:01] something that um when we get back to
[59:04] somewhat Bitcoin maximalism and and and
[59:07] um tokenized stuff and shitcoins if we
[59:10] talk all about these things I think this
[59:13] is something that um you know many
[59:15] bitcoiners are struggling understanding
[59:17] because they start their Journey with
[59:18] hearing about Bitcoin or any other
[59:21] shitcoin but sooner or later they will
[59:23] be get exposed to um all the these other
[59:27] um Innovative coins then burn their
[59:30] fingers um and by by by trading them
[59:34] losing a lot of money and then realizing
[59:36] well this is all a little bit uh sketchy
[59:38] if they're lucky they get back into
[59:40] Bitcoin and then potentially also in the
[59:43] meanwhile have read a little bit about
[59:45] it and then understand well these are
[59:46] two different things one is fish and one
[59:48] is beef um the beef is actually all
[59:51] about changing our financial system
[59:54] changing um the way we save changing the
[59:57] way we interact and creating a more
[59:59] Sovereign um and and you know valuable
[60:03] Society versus the other thing is just
[60:05] Fiat will translate into get quick Rich
[60:09] uh and therefore I hate it all
[60:12] now what this creates is um it it it
[60:15] eliminates the appreciation for the
[60:17] actual technology underneath which is a
[60:20] decentralized ledger that allows to
[60:22] store and process information uh and
[60:25] data differently than it is when a
[60:27] centralized entity does it and and and
[60:30] therefore I think we're we're we're
[60:32] currently still failing to understand
[60:34] the full potential of a decentralized
[60:36] world because many people are so focused
[60:39] or at least in our industry in our
[60:41] Bitcoin bubble um um a lot of us are so
[60:44] focused on pushing Bitcoin um and and
[60:48] making sure that Bitcoin is adopted uh
[60:52] accepted and there's enough to do don't
[60:54] get me wrong yeah there's enough to do
[60:56] to get Bitcoin accepted by big players
[60:58] by banks for certain processes for
[60:59] collateral for this for that so there's
[61:01] enough to do in our industry um and I'm
[61:04] not encouraging anyone to work in any
[61:06] other industry in the world um because I
[61:09] think it's it's it's the absolute
[61:11]  cool coolest uh uh industry that
[61:15] one can work in spend their time in and
[61:17] um but I also think that that leads into
[61:20] a direction where we're not thinking
[61:22] what that decentralized ecosystem what
[61:24] else it could do and I'm very happy that
[61:26] we're seeing Innovation on bitcoin over
[61:29] the last specifically 12 to 16 years uh
[61:32] months excuse me um um happening because
[61:35] I think this will open up a whole new
[61:37] industry and a whole new wave of
[61:39] innovation and in a whole new wave of
[61:41] people on board it being on board it it
[61:43] it's it will Foster a lot of uh great
[61:46] developments in Bitcoin um I have one
[61:49] question to ask each and every one of my
[61:50] guests and the question is what can we
[61:52] learn from you besides Bitcoin for me
[61:57] yeah from from you like uh where it's
[62:00] interesting this this question actually
[62:02] triggers usually and follow up question
[62:04] from the guest is like okay for me
[62:06] personally or like a skill you learn or
[62:08] from a company like wherever you want to
[62:10] go with it wherever you want to take it
[62:12] maybe I have to reframe question one day
[62:16] no it's it's an interesting question it
[62:18] uh it's like well there's I think I
[62:20] think there's there's much better people
[62:23] out there to to that you can learn stuff
[62:26] from um so it really makes me
[62:29] think
[62:31] um I I can snowboard um that's something
[62:34] that I really enjoy and that I like to
[62:36] do and um I'm already like you know
[62:39] every every every February that I'm not
[62:41] going out uh to Austria Switzerland or
[62:45] uh to the Rockies or anywhere else to
[62:47] snowboard or ski I'm a little bit sad
[62:49] and this is one of these Winters yeah
[62:51] I've been between Paraguay and Ethiopia
[62:54] and but not not any where in the Alps um
[62:57] so that makes me sad but I'm hoping to
[63:00] go in December this year and and really
[63:02] spend a good time in the AL so if you
[63:04] want to learn skiing or snowboarding
[63:06] that's something that I'm good at and
[63:07] and that I enjoy
[63:08] doing really cool I'm I'm I'm I'm one of
[63:12] the aans that is not good in skiing no I
[63:15] never tried it but uh ski skiing is like
[63:18] I'm good like I I usually try to like
[63:22] come two three times down the slope and
[63:24] then uh sit in
[63:28] uh and and enjoy the time there I I I
[63:31] really like being on top of the mountain
[63:33] when everything is white and just seeing
[63:35] the sun that's like that is amazing uh
[63:38] and I have no clue how to uh translate
[63:40] that dish now it's a gam noodle I love
[63:43] it on on on the on on the house on the
[63:45] mountain on top of it it's really really
[63:47] cool um we have an end routin in the
[63:49] podcast where the previous guest is
[63:51] asking a question for the next guest
[63:52] without knowing who the next guest
[63:54] actually is and question from the
[63:56] previous guest is if you can use Bitcoin
[63:59] only through third parties but we are
[64:02] totally on a Bitcoin standard would you
[64:04] be okay with that no I wouldn't be um
[64:08] because for me that takes the freedom or
[64:10] one of the main aspects which is the um
[64:14] the freedom and non-custodial access to
[64:16] it um away yeah being on a Bitcoin
[64:19] standard sounds great um backing
[64:22] everything with Bitcoin and not being in
[64:24] the Fiat world anymore more obviously
[64:26] great for Price appreciation and so
[64:28] forth but I think one of the major um
[64:32] major benefits of Bitcoin is that I'm
[64:34] not relying on anyone else um to manage
[64:38] my assets manage my wealth and manage my
[64:41] transactions and if it is only possible
[64:45] via third parties that means there is
[64:48] one or multiple entities that have a
[64:51] 100% absolute control over me which
[64:54] means it is not the Bitcoin
[64:56] standard so that question is somewhat um
[65:00] somewhat reminding me of the movie
[65:02] Inception um does is one possible
[65:05] without the other um and and and I would
[65:07] say no
[65:09] so if the question
[65:12] was do I enjoy the Bitcoin standard or
[65:15] would I look forward to that yes
[65:16] absolutely um would I allow or would I
[65:20] want to live in a world where um um
[65:23] third parties I can only access my
[65:26] assets wealth and transactions via third
[65:28] parties I'd say I'm out of that world
[65:31] pull that plug from the Matrix please
[65:33] and um do these things happen together I
[65:36] don't think so um for for me the Bitcoin
[65:38] standard includes um non-custodial
[65:41] access and and power over own wealth and
[65:44] and
[65:45] assets it's almost an oxymoron like like
[65:49] it's almost like a self-contradicting
[65:52] sentence can you have a can you can you
[65:55] have a Bitcoin standard if you have to
[65:57] use third parties for that like that
[66:00] that seems to be an illogical thing to
[66:03] do I agree I agree really cool then
