[00:00] I call myself a self custody Max notist
[00:02] when you only have it on Exchange you
[00:04] understand the number grop technology
[00:06] but not the freedom grop technology you
[00:08] might get rock pulled might get
[00:09] something like an FTX it's so easy to
[00:12] get hacked we all know that from
[00:14] previous experience like the FTX they
[00:16] can easily store your coins into other
[00:19] base so the only way to solve this
[00:21] problems is you keep it on your own hand
[00:25] most users on the Bitcoin blockchain
[00:28] have their Bitcoin in exchange with a
[00:30] custodian but the most Bitcoin like is
[00:33] actually in self custody get the coins
[00:35] out of the exchange and to your own
[00:37] wallet I'm a bitcoiner I only have
[00:39] Bitcoin I do not have any altcoins on my
[00:42] hand how does a hard wallet actually
[00:46] work first thing that I want to cover is
[00:48] like always like especially you also on
[00:50] the founder team and the founders are
[00:52] always unique because they have like a
[00:54] reason why they do something like they
[00:56] they have a reason why they start
[00:57] something why did you and uh your
[00:59] colleagues uh start Keystone wallet like
[01:02] how did you get motivated to like okay
[01:04] we have to do something did you see
[01:06] something that was missing on the market
[01:08] or like why did you get started with
[01:11] Keystone uh okay so I think it's a long
[01:15] story and we can I I can try to uh
[01:19] explain more details about how we start
[01:22] Keystone and how the whole thing started
[01:25] I think um the story what can be started
[01:29] is uh when I first uh when I first
[01:33] learned about Bitcoin so I
[01:38] um I think that time is uh
[01:42] 2017 I just read the um white paper of
[01:47] of the Bitcoin of what Satoshi WR and
[01:51] really I see that really shock that that
[01:54] shock me so uh previously I uh I have
[01:59] never I actually I have never thought
[02:03] about uh there are the the
[02:05] cryptocurrencies or there is the um uh
[02:10] cryptocurrencies can actually work
[02:12] because you can it can be easy uh if if
[02:15] the it's a digital stuff it can be
[02:17] easily CED so how to um make that happen
[02:23] so uh what Satoshi did and of when I
[02:26] first read the uh white paper I I just
[02:31] um spend I I think one week or two weeks
[02:34] to um to go through every details about
[02:39] about each part of the Bitcoin and and
[02:43] the uh like the utso stuff like the um p
[02:49] and these kind of things combine them
[02:51] all it can just work and that is really
[02:56] uh shocked me so uh from from that time
[02:59] I would like to uh to jump into the
[03:02] repid hle and so uh just seeking the
[03:05] opportunities and seeking uh the how I
[03:09] can enter this place because previously
[03:12] I was a software engineer which is work
[03:15] like the big companies like the IBM and
[03:18] like the uh solar Works which is our uh
[03:23] so software agency uh a software
[03:26] Consulting agency so I build a a bunch
[03:30] of these uh software systems I know how
[03:33] to uh code and at that time I just want
[03:37] to uh build something cool in the uh
[03:41] Bitcoin stuff so um after like two or
[03:46] three mons I found uh which is um my
[03:50] last of company called Cobo and and um
[03:54] he um it well Welling to build a um
[03:59] software
[04:00] uh Waring company so uh which is can um
[04:06] bring much better user uh user
[04:09] experience to the users so I think that
[04:14] is the my enter into this space so when
[04:18] I joined the company I made my
[04:21] um my uh my my teammate and made uh my
[04:26] uh partner which is re is CEO of
[04:28] Keystone wallet so we start uh working
[04:31] together to build something uh to build
[04:34] uh something together at that time we
[04:37] thinking that um because previously we
[04:41] have some experiences on the both on the
[04:44] software party and hardware part and
[04:47] when I uh when we just enter this space
[04:50] and uh want to see how we can comply our
[04:55] um our strengths our
[04:58] uh capacities to uh this work so we
[05:03] think the hardware wallet is a really
[05:06] good uh really good point to uh enter
[05:11] the uh enter the uh enter the uh Bitcoin
[05:15] space so uh that is why we um so for the
[05:21] kstone this first three years we named
[05:24] as cob wat uh so we will really focus on
[05:28] the Bitcoin community and to contribute
[05:31] our uh efforts to build like uh really
[05:35] easy to use and easy to um e to manage
[05:42] uh Hardware wallet to the a users so
[05:46] back to uh that period of time I think
[05:49] in the market there there is uh the
[05:53] hardware wet is really hard to use so no
[05:57] matter you use uh use uh treasure or
[05:59] Ledger device or use uh
[06:02] use uh other devices it will have it
[06:06] always have the we lat screen which is
[06:10] you can cannot get quite uh the idea
[06:13] about uh how the transaction goes and
[06:17] compare and we think that if the
[06:20] hardware wet is act like this it is
[06:23] really hard for the average users to
[06:26] enter the Bitcoin Community to manage
[06:29] coins by themselves so uh in that time
[06:33] we we think we would like to provide uh
[06:36] Hardware wet which is quite like the um
[06:41] like your phones so user do not every
[06:45] user do not uh have to learn a lot to uh
[06:50] to to figure out how to use that they
[06:53] can just um use their previously uh
[06:58] previously um experience how they can
[07:01] use their phones to uh to to use the
[07:05] hardware wallet so uh in that time that
[07:09] we call our last generation product
[07:12] which is called the uh K uh Kone 2 we
[07:16] call them that internally it is a uh has
[07:20] a very big touch screens so user can um
[07:25] see more information on the screen and
[07:28] we introduce the uh
[07:31] fingerprint um into the device so user
[07:35] can uh sign the transactions and
[07:37] authorize the transactions by their
[07:40] fingerprints this kind of the experience
[07:43] is really uh normal in the uh in the in
[07:47] the mobile phones but actually they are
[07:51] uh back to that time that is a really R
[07:55] in the Bitcoin community so that is the
[07:58] reason we think that we can offer uh a
[08:01] better uh device which is can be easy to
[08:05] use and meanwhile can keep uh the
[08:08] security
[08:10] to uh to to help the uh Bitcoin
[08:13] community and help the aage users can to
[08:17] to to to do the self- custody to keep
[08:21] their keys so I think that will uh and
[08:25] we think that that is the only way or we
[08:29] can help more and more users to do the
[08:32] selfcast to yeah that is basically how
[08:36] everything started and how uh and why we
[08:40] would like to enter the space and
[08:42] provide uh like a uh a new hardware
[08:47] wallet into the market or into the
[08:49] Bitcoin
[08:50] Community yeah and it's a it's a great
[08:52] thing because we have to make uh self
[08:54] cust more accessible there the more uh
[08:59] devices is the more solutions we have
[09:01] the more options the consumer has and
[09:03] the more likely he is to actually enter
[09:07] and actually have a self custody
[09:09] solution because I see a lot of people
[09:12] don't even get to self custody they
[09:13] leave it on Exchange they buy it
[09:15] somewhere on whatever coinbase uh Gren
[09:19] whatever the bit uh uh coin The Exchange
[09:22] is and they leave it there um let's talk
[09:25] about that like why is the jump from The
[09:28] Exchange to sell custody is so important
[09:30] like what is for you the the main reason
[09:33] why people should take their own keys
[09:36] and not leave it on
[09:37] Exchange yeah actually personally I'm a
[09:41] I call myself is a self- custy Max
[09:43] modist so no matter uh what coins you
[09:47] manage you should keep uh you should
[09:49] manage by yourselves I truly believe uh
[09:52] what is called not your ke not your
[09:54] coins so we know that the Bitcoin is our
[09:59] like solution for our current Financial
[10:02] systems so uh that is my belief it is
[10:06] the solution I think that is the only
[10:08] solution to our breaking current
[10:11] breaking system a finan financial system
[10:15] so if you leave your coins or your
[10:18] Bitcoins into the exchange you actually
[10:20] do not know how they manage them so they
[10:23] say that I only you like one Bitcoin but
[10:27] does it actually EX exist I'm quite
[10:31] question about that so actually there
[10:34] are bunch of ways that can try to
[10:36] explain okay we hold the funds we hold
[10:40] the uh coins and um and the regulate uh
[10:44] Regulators can regulate that and to keep
[10:47] them safe but we all know that from
[10:50] previous experience like the FTX this
[10:53] kind of stuff they can easily store your
[10:56] coins your funds into other play
[11:00] so the only way to to solve these
[11:02] problems is you keep it on your own hand
[11:07] so that is the
[11:09] reason I think that self custody on and
[11:14] it is really crucial when we talk about
[11:17] Bitcoin
[11:18] communities um personally I'm as so I
[11:23] talk to every uh friend um and to every
[11:28] friend so
[11:29] if you want truly own like a Bitcoin you
[11:34] you you can buy it on the exchange that
[11:37] after that just get the coins out of the
[11:40] exchange into to your uh to your own
[11:43] wallet no matter it is a software wallet
[11:47] or it's a hardware wallet and that's I
[11:51] think that that that is the step one you
[11:54] truly understand what is Bitcoins and
[11:58] why and and so if you just keep the
[12:01] coins into the
[12:04] exchange I say that you are not truly
[12:07] understand what is bitcoin yeah yeah
[12:10] 100% because when you only have it on
[12:12] Exchange you understand the number gr
[12:15] technology but not the freedom gr
[12:17] technology and you might get rck pulled
[12:19] uh you might get something like an FDX
[12:22] or something like that there are so many
[12:23] examples in the past like three four
[12:25] five years uh how people lost their
[12:28] coins and then like not even if if the
[12:32] exchange does not uh go broke or it does
[12:35] not do something funny it's so easy to
[12:38] get hacked just username password it's
[12:41] way easier to get hacked even with two
[12:43] two Factor authentification uh with a
[12:45] cold wallet that you have on yourself
[12:48] you don't connect it with the internet
[12:50] uh it's it's way way harder to be uh a
[12:53] hacked um yeah for for for the people uh
[12:57] that are listening now for me it's all
[12:59] was like uh when we have self custody we
[13:02] have to look at different layers like
[13:04] some user that has a thousand Euros or
[13:07] dollars in in in Bitcoin in a self
[13:09] custody wallet it's way different than
[13:12] someone has like 100,000 or maybe like
[13:15] 10 million uh Euros to secure like let's
[13:19] talk a little bit like what do you
[13:21] recommend when like what this the feat
[13:24] amount where like in on that amount you
[13:27] have to take a a code wallet a hardware
[13:30] wallet because it's also an an
[13:31] investment so like if you just have 10
[13:33] euros in Bitcoin it probably does not
[13:35] make sense to buy like a 100 EUR a
[13:38] hardware wallet uh like what is the
[13:40] amount where it makes sense to buy one
[13:42] and then is the amount where you have to
[13:45] level up with multi signature is there
[13:47] anything above uh like uh when you have
[13:50] like $100,000 or like a million in in in
[13:53] Bitcoin where do you see like those
[13:55] those layers and those different
[13:57] solutions yeah so uh that is what I
[14:01] called a wish everyone everyone in the
[14:04] Bitcoin Community should set up their
[14:06] own like the want system to manage their
[14:10] Bitcoins so uh just like you said that
[14:15] uh different people owns different
[14:17] amount of Bitcoin so if you just um own
[14:21] a a little bit of us Bitcoins which is
[14:24] worth like uh$ 100 or
[14:27] $200 I think that is enough you can just
[14:30] use the software wallet and you can
[14:33] choose the uh light uh the well-known
[14:37] software wallet which is can be uh which
[14:40] is should be must be open source I think
[14:43] that we can put the open source AR uh
[14:46] into later and we can dive into that
[14:48] part uh and like the blue wallet if you
[14:52] want to uh keep that on your cell phones
[14:56] and if you um own like
[15:00] uh I think 10ks uh worth of the uh USD
[15:06] uh uh that amount of Bitcoins I think
[15:09] that is a uh that is the entral point
[15:13] which is you would like to choose the
[15:15] hardware wallet because um the hardware
[15:19] wallets is really different with uh
[15:22] between uh with really different with
[15:24] the software wallet so the hardware
[15:26] wallet usually that that is
[15:29] are like the offline device which is you
[15:32] can keep your keys safely s that into
[15:36] the um uh no matter it is have the sare
[15:41] elements or not you can just put that
[15:44] put put the secret key your private Keys
[15:47] into uh that device and basically if you
[15:51] are not using that uh that device you
[15:54] can keep the uh that at your home or
[15:57] your safe box or other places so this
[16:01] will dramatically reduce the attack
[16:04] surface of uh which is really uh
[16:09] increase the security of your uh of your
[16:14] Bitcoins so um I I I I I think that the
[16:19] next steps so generally speak uh
[16:21] generally speaking and if you on to the
[16:25] another step so let's say that you have
[16:29] uh 1 million uh US dollar worth of
[16:32] bitcoin and I think that part you should
[16:36] uh set up a more like um like uh robotic
[16:40] systems which is you can apply to the MC
[16:45] and you you you probably will think
[16:47] about how you can um how how you can
[16:53] safely uh start your seat free probably
[16:57] you should consider the Sham backup
[17:00] system which is usually C uh sleep 39
[17:05] which is uh generally speaking it is
[17:09] just the uh split your C into uh
[17:13] different uh different pieces and you
[17:16] can put that into uh into uh different
[17:19] locations and on probably on the uh next
[17:24] part you should uh build like uh
[17:29] more complic uh complicated system to
[17:33] keep your fonts and on Next Level
[17:37] probably you are institutions which is
[17:41] uh you use the uh Bitcoin Bitcoin to to
[17:44] to this do do your business so uh at
[17:48] that part probably the mod is a must and
[17:51] share backup is a must and choose the uh
[17:55] different walls and choose the different
[17:58] software wallets or the hardware wallet
[18:01] to build build up the whole wallet
[18:04] system for your
[18:07] institutions uh is really a a must uh
[18:11] really a must
[18:13] so different peoples will have different
[18:17] um solutions for their Bitcoin Comm uh
[18:22] Bitcoin uh security um and I think uh
[18:26] first you should not leverage on that uh
[18:29] on the exchange that the F uh
[18:32] fundamental points and second um based
[18:36] on your current uh volume of your
[18:39] Bitcoin you can choose different options
[18:43] so and
[18:44] meanwhile um I think for the individuals
[18:48] that uh when they first enter the
[18:51] Bitcoin space they probably will found
[18:55] there are bunch of new things should to
[18:57] learn so for example say uh what is what
[19:02] is a key what is a private key what does
[19:04] the private key a different uh is
[19:07] different from uh from the password why
[19:10] I should keep the uh private key so if I
[19:14] lose a priority key why my my Bitcoin is
[19:16] gone so they should understand that and
[19:19] from that point you can start like uh
[19:22] from this uh from software wallet which
[19:25] is can give you really um good
[19:30] understandings or your experience to do
[19:33] the self cust and with the time goes and
[19:38] mean and also with the uh with the uh
[19:43] with the coins you have more so probably
[19:45] you can choose uh better um solutions
[19:49] for keep your Bitcoin safe so I think
[19:53] that for our average users um 10K
[19:57] probably is our ENT point to enter the
[20:00] hardware wallet uh
[20:03] space yeah definitely it's a good amount
[20:06] if uh if you have a thousand a 10,000 uh
[20:09] in in Bitcoin you definitely should have
[20:11] like look at uh uh a self- custody
[20:15] Hardware wallet device um let's dive a
[20:19] little bit into the technical because
[20:20] you're the CTO of of of the Keystone
[20:22] wallet uh and we never covered on the
[20:25] podcast like how does uh hard wallet
[20:27] like actually
[20:29] like work and how does it keep the keep
[20:33] the the Bitcoin secure and how does this
[20:35] all like uh come into place there's like
[20:38] secure elements involved there's a lot
[20:40] of uh moving parts and let's like let's
[20:43] let's let's approach it from a simple
[20:45] perspective like how does hard wallet in
[20:47] general work and then how is like maybe
[20:49] the Keystone wallet uh um special with
[20:52] the secure elements and stuff like that
[20:55] yeah so uh okay so uh
[20:59] I think I will first jump into the
[21:01] hardware the general parts of Hardware
[21:04] wallet to explain how it works and uh
[21:08] from my perspective how I can um tell
[21:12] whether a hardware wallet is a good or
[21:15] not good and then we can jump into the
[21:18] kyone part so uh I will talk about how
[21:22] we think uh how we design a good
[21:25] Hardware wallet and uh what is the
[21:29] differ uh difference between the kyone
[21:32] hardware wallet and and others so for
[21:36] the first part uh what is the hardware
[21:38] wallet I I think that uh I previously uh
[21:43] talk with my friends to try to introduce
[21:47] the hardware W to them so the there are
[21:50] two main functions I think for the uh
[21:53] Hardware wallet one is to securely store
[21:58] your
[21:59] priorities that is uh that is one part
[22:04] and the second part is that
[22:07] security sign the
[22:09] transactions so that basically the two
[22:12] fundamentals in the hardware wet so we
[22:16] all know that uh Bitcoin is safe and
[22:19] Bitcoins is can bring the true freedom
[22:23] to the individual users so how um how to
[22:26] achieve that is um every Bitcoins every
[22:31] um satosi they are all stores on the uh
[22:37] likes on the private keys so uh so um
[22:43] how you say that uh so if you uh if you
[22:49] uh have your properties you can sign the
[22:51] transactions and take control of your
[22:54] Bitcoins so uh for the hardware war is
[22:57] the the first part of that is uh quick
[23:02] is
[23:02] simply store the private keys so that is
[23:06] why the hardware wallets all need like
[23:09] secure elements so the secure elements
[23:12] is you can think that is our uh our
[23:17] securely designed chip which is usually
[23:21] um you can store the uh the secret
[23:24] information secret data into that and
[23:28] the square elements uh if it's well
[23:31] designed and well implemented it can uh
[23:35] prevent like the physical attack uh like
[23:38] the side Channel attack and these kind
[23:40] of attacks to uh to uh from the hackers
[23:45] so even the
[23:47] hackers um get your Hardware wallet they
[23:51] uh they get the secure element and try
[23:55] to uh uh try to extract the data from
[23:59] the square element basically it is
[24:02] really hard to achieve that if you are
[24:04] using H sare
[24:05] elements that is the um points of the
[24:10] why a a welld designed Hardware warries
[24:14] uh should have the secare uh secure
[24:16] elements so if you are using a general
[24:19] purpose like the microcontroller unit uh
[24:23] you you store the uh sensitive data or
[24:26] your private Keys into the flash so when
[24:29] the hacker uh gets your Hardware wallet
[24:33] it can like to retrieve this kind of
[24:37] information from The Flash and try to
[24:40] break your ping keys so we believe and
[24:45] uh we think that uh Square elements is
[24:48] the black the must from the hardware
[24:51] side to uh 40 Hardware
[24:54] wallet so the part the meaning of this
[24:57] that it is securely store your private
[25:01] Keys uh that is the first part and
[25:04] second part is that um if you can if you
[25:07] would like to authorize transactions
[25:10] into the uh if you would like to
[25:13] authorize the transactions so you
[25:16] basically uh we doing the um signing
[25:20] stuff on the hardware wallet which is uh
[25:24] really
[25:25] important so uh
[25:29] that is the F uh that is the second uh
[25:32] fundamental part of the hardware wet is
[25:35] how uh the hardware War it is using your
[25:39] private
[25:40] keys so
[25:44] um uh so uh for example if I would like
[25:47] to authorize the uh Bitcoin transactions
[25:51] the onsign transaction data will some
[25:53] somehow to transmit that into the
[25:57] hardware wallet and the hardware wet
[25:59] will decode that uh data and display to
[26:03] the uh to the user so they can verify um
[26:08] the information so the from uh if the
[26:11] form information uh if the form address
[26:13] is right if the uh destination address
[26:16] is right if the change address is your
[26:19] change address so if the amount is right
[26:22] it if uh if uh the C is what you set so
[26:27] every
[26:29] um piece of uh this kind of uh
[26:32] transaction information should be
[26:35] honestly display it in the hardware
[26:37] wallet and to Mi the user to confirm
[26:41] that and after uh after user confirm the
[26:45] hardware wallet while using the PIV Keys
[26:48] which is store in the device and do the
[26:51] signing stuff and give the signature
[26:54] back back to the uh light no matter is a
[26:58] panning app or is the uh uh is a
[27:02] application run on your computer or uh
[27:06] or other things that is a uh we believe
[27:09] the second parts of the hardware
[27:12] wallet so it's can truly understand and
[27:16] analyze what you would like to uh what
[27:19] you would like to do and show that
[27:22] information honestly and clearly to the
[27:25] user to make them understand what they
[27:28] are signing so that uh that is the
[27:31] second part and uh you can see that uh
[27:34] ding the whole uh process that your
[27:38] private keys will never um out of the
[27:42] hardware wallet so uh so will just uh
[27:47] exist in your Hardware wallet and do all
[27:50] the stuff that's the uh meaning of why
[27:53] you should uh using a hardware wallet
[27:56] and it's excuse me and compared to the
[28:00] software
[28:01] wallet that's uh that's a big difference
[28:04] uh so in the software wet no matter is
[28:08] are application run on your computer or
[28:11] is a application on your on your
[28:14] mobile so uh the private ke is always on
[28:20] your computer or on your phones so uh
[28:24] technically speaking it uh the private
[28:28] te is always connect uh always
[28:30] connecting with the network so that will
[28:34] be a huge attack attack
[28:36] sface uh for your proper keys so uh the
[28:40] HW waret what is really dramatically
[28:44] reduce that is that uh talking surface
[28:47] so when you're using the hardware wallet
[28:50] so uh basically is just to store your
[28:54] priv keys on the device and the onlyl uh
[28:58] the the only time it can connect
[29:00] interact with other parties is when uh
[29:04] it uh signing in the trans
[29:07] transactions and which in this way is
[29:11] really uh reduce the attack
[29:14] surface uh of your private keys so
[29:18] generally speaking that is uh how the
[29:21] hardware wage uh worked so I will make a
[29:25] quick summary about that first is it
[29:27] will
[29:29] uh securely store your private Keys
[29:32] basically in the sare uh sqare elements
[29:36] and the second part is that it will do
[29:39] uh doing the signing stuff on this on
[29:42] the
[29:43] device and it will always show um the
[29:48] information to users to make them
[29:50] confirm so that is two fundamental Parts
[29:54] uh of the hardware wet and back to
[29:56] Keystone and how we we uh think about
[29:59] that uh in our currently uh in our last
[30:03] generation uh device which is Keystone 3
[30:06] Pro we have uh three sare elements two
[30:11] is for storage and one is for the
[30:14] fingerprint process so um we combine the
[30:19] Two sare element together to SEC
[30:22] securely store your information your
[30:25] private Keys into the uh sare elements.
[30:29] part one and meanwhile uh we you know
[30:33] that tone three have the finger
[30:35] fingerprint sensor on the device so uh
[30:39] your fingerprint data all this kind of
[30:42] uh bio bio sensitive data also secur is
[30:47] uh sto uh stored on the secur MCU which
[30:52] is do the uh verification and uh verific
[30:56] oh which is which is doing the
[30:59] verification of your
[31:01] fingerprints that's the whole point why
[31:03] we choose three uh three uh sare
[31:07] elements on our device and meanwhile uh
[31:11] for the sunning part I think we are
[31:14] probably the um the best the best um
[31:18] user friendly devices in the market so
[31:22] we have a large uh dis um displays which
[31:26] can uh which can display the uh as much
[31:30] the information as possible to the users
[31:34] and meanwhile we do the uh transaction
[31:38] decoding uh on our like the uh on our
[31:43] device to make the um users
[31:47] can understand what they actually
[31:50] signing and mean meanwhile the Kone use
[31:54] the QR code for the data Transmissions
[31:57] so which is really uh easy to use and
[32:02] meanwhile to reduce the um
[32:04] vulnerabilities of like other
[32:07] transmission protocol like a Bluetooth
[32:10] or a USB stuff so that is basically the
[32:16] uh the design sying be uh behind the
[32:20] Keystone 3 Hardware wallet and uh What
[32:23] uh what we are quite different uh
[32:26] different with other Hardware wallet if
[32:29] you are listening to this podcast you
[32:31] might be wondering what is actually the
[32:33] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[32:36] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[32:38] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[32:40] right source and you have to store
[32:42] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[32:44] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[32:46] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[32:49] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[32:51] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[32:53] own token or something like that be on a
[32:55] Bitcoin only exchange I use to 21
[32:58] Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is for me the best
[33:00] partner for that and now where do you
[33:03] store Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored
[33:05] on a hardware wallet on a self custody
[33:09] solution where you yourself hold your
[33:11] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[33:14] that's my Simple Solutions that's a
[33:17] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[33:19] there back up your seat fras and you are
[33:22] better than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers
[33:26] if you have more than a ,000 in Bitcoin
[33:29] it's a absolutely must have one last
[33:31] thing before we get back to the video
[33:33] I'm really passionate about meeting
[33:35] other bitcoiners and there's an amazing
[33:37] opportunity in middle of Europe in June
[33:41] the Bitcoin BR conference it's the best
[33:44] and biggest Bitcoin only conference in
[33:47] whole of Europe for all Americans please
[33:49] visit Europe and visit this place in
[33:51] June for all europees it's a must go
[33:54] anyways you so close to the Bitcoin PR
[33:57] conference you basically have to come I
[33:59] will do interviews there and I would
[34:01] love to meet you all there use code
[34:04] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[34:06] discounts and use the links down in the
[34:08] description that's that's fascinating um
[34:12] usually in technology when you design
[34:14] stuff like uh even with the Bitcoin base
[34:17] layer uh it's never perfect like in the
[34:20] Bitcoin base layer uh we have to scale
[34:22] through layer technology because we have
[34:24] the small uh block size so that we can
[34:27] can have security network or the the
[34:30] full no are not that that big and stuff
[34:32] like that like there's always like
[34:34] tradeoffs to technology is there uh when
[34:37] you decide a hardware wallet like the
[34:38] Keystone is there any tradeoffs you have
[34:42] to think of in the in the technology
[34:45] design we like if I if we in like I
[34:48] don't know maybe like convenience versus
[34:51] security is there anything you thought
[34:53] of like we got we went to this route
[34:55] with Keystone instead of this rout
[34:58] because we think that is better like is
[35:00] there any like a tradeoff between
[35:03] anything that you can think of where you
[35:05] f like in the design process it's better
[35:08] to do it that way or that way or other
[35:11] uh Hardware wallets do it more like that
[35:14] way and we do it like that way I'm just
[35:16] like trying to figure out if there's
[35:17] like any fundamental um uh tradeoffs you
[35:21] have to make when designing a hardware
[35:24] wallet yeah I think um
[35:28] so when you do something that is always
[35:31] you should uh do some trade off like to
[35:35] deliver the products and I think what we
[35:38] are doing is that we should we always
[35:43] want to uh make a good product to the
[35:46] end users so uh back to the Kyo uh story
[35:51] and actually
[35:54] um so uh I think the the the treat up we
[35:58] mostly made is that uh
[36:02] we um we we will actually the Keystone 3
[36:08] is not inherit inherit anything from our
[36:12] last generation product so the biggest
[36:14] trat off is that we build everything
[36:17] from scratch I think no matter is the
[36:19] hardware side or the software
[36:23] side so that is a really hard decision
[36:28] to make when we first uh when we first
[36:32] uh uh to decide to do that um and the
[36:36] reason why we do that is
[36:40] uh
[36:43] um is that uh there are previously there
[36:46] are a lot of feedback about our last
[36:49] generation product so the last Genera
[36:52] product is um basically is the Android
[36:55] Solutions so we using the uh Androids as
[37:00] the operation system um which and we
[37:03] write up uh applications which is
[37:06] running the um uh running the uh uh
[37:11] Hardware uh product logic and meanwhile
[37:15] we uh using um square square elements to
[37:19] running the uh signing stuff in our last
[37:23] Generations so when we launch the
[37:25] product uh you uh a lot of feedback come
[37:29] uh into uh our teams and they say that
[37:33] the uh Android uh Android system is hard
[37:37] to understand and hard to
[37:40] audit and um and it is really hard to um
[37:46] to do to achieve the reproducible and
[37:50] verifiable um
[37:52] firmware because the Android system code
[37:57] has
[37:58] like I I think that that is the 40 or or
[38:02] 60 sub repositories you you you can
[38:06] never always to do the whole um all this
[38:12] stuff by yourself and meanwhile the
[38:15] Android uh system probably will have
[38:18] some um
[38:20] underneath uh vulnerabilities that
[38:23] nobody knows so uh and
[38:28] but uh from the like the development
[38:32] side and from the um from the US side
[38:36] the Android system which is can can be
[38:39] uh really fast to uh deliver and
[38:42] meanwhile can provide a much uh much
[38:47] better user experience to the end users
[38:51] so back to our kyom 3 product and we
[38:55] decide to completely remove the
[38:58] Android and so we uh choose our security
[39:02] element uh sorry we we choose our
[39:05] general
[39:06] purpose uh micro uh control unit uh to
[39:13] uh running the firware and meanwhile we
[39:16] would like to achieve a better uh user
[39:19] experience compared to our last
[39:24] Generations so uh we put a lot of uh uh
[39:30] put a lot of work in and lot of
[39:34] um uh we put a lot of uh our development
[39:38] resource and a lot of work onto that and
[39:41] try to uh provide a better uh uh better
[39:46] uh user experience and which is can
[39:49] compare our last
[39:50] Generations so yeah uh I I think our
[39:54] current our current product
[39:58] um is good in uh is good compared with
[40:03] other uh MCU based Hardware wet and but
[40:08] we have a lot of um space can improve
[40:12] and we
[40:13] will uh we are also trying to um make
[40:18] our likees uh uh the user experience is
[40:23] uh is better and much more better so so
[40:28] I think that is the uh one big tradeoff
[40:32] to M which is we choose a completely new
[40:37] way to achieve the our kiston 3 so we
[40:42] are um personally I'm really proud we
[40:45] can uh achieve that and but that really
[40:51] cost a lot of our energy and our our uh
[40:55] work to make that Happ
[40:57] but and but uh our current uh design and
[41:02] our current
[41:04] um uh which is the new design uh new new
[41:07] system design is really is much more
[41:11] focused on the security and simple uh
[41:15] and
[41:17] similarity uh
[41:19] for uh for the uh Hardware wallet so it
[41:24] is really easy to audit and easy uh to
[41:29] review so I think that is uh what the
[41:34] the biggest the benefits we achieve from
[41:37] the technique
[41:39] trof yeah that's uh and I think is an
[41:42] important step to uh overthink like what
[41:45] are we doing and can we do it from
[41:47] scratch better uh because if you just
[41:50] build on thing that are already here uh
[41:53] you might run into the problem that you
[41:54] have something that's down here and it's
[41:56] not working and then you build on
[41:58] something that's not good so like I I
[42:00] really appreciate like that uh the new
[42:03] approach and thinking something
[42:04] completely new that's kind of what
[42:06] Bitcoin is doing to the financial world
[42:07] like right now because we know that the
[42:10] fat monetary system is just not working
[42:12] as it is and we are having like a
[42:14] completely new system that we're just
[42:16] now building out and we really early in
[42:18] this uh game and I I love the comp
[42:21] comparison that you make um at for the
[42:24] end for the podcast I would like to uh
[42:26] maybe we get a little bit on the
[42:28] regulatory side also um do you have any
[42:31] fear or any doubt in mind that like self
[42:34] custody might be uh banned or might be
[42:38] under investigation because you allow um
[42:43] citizens to be
[42:46] Sovereign uh that is really uh good
[42:50] question so we
[42:51] see uh currently a lot of crazy things I
[42:55] I think it happen especially in our
[42:58] communities we all know that uh the
[43:01] Wasabi wallet is Ban for the US citizens
[43:05] and a lot of C stuff uh from my
[43:07] perspective uh is happening uh into uh
[43:10] into into the world
[43:13] currently and uh as an engineer as a
[43:18] like a developer from my perspective I I
[43:23] think that
[43:25] um the two are not guy so you cannot uh
[43:30] blame uh the people who create create uh
[43:33] create the tools to help people to do
[43:36] the um to to to do the self custody and
[43:40] to do the uh to control their own
[43:43] destiny
[43:45] so but actually there are a lot of
[43:48] regulations are doing and and from from
[43:53] my thinking that um our community or
[43:58] um so uh everyone in the community
[44:01] should have probably should have um um
[44:05] better Communications with others
[44:07] especially with The Regulators or other
[44:11] stuff I think what you are doing is
[44:13] really uh meaningful and real really
[44:16] helpful to make everyone uh in the world
[44:20] can understand what is the Bitcoin what
[44:23] is uh what is the thinking and what is
[44:26] the beh
[44:27] the Bitcoin is so why Bitcoin is matters
[44:31] why self C matters what problem of our
[44:35] current system uh and try to spread the
[44:40] uh insight into them so I think uh with
[44:44] the efforts of the whole
[44:47] communities uh properly in uh sometimes
[44:51] um people will know and um match more
[44:55] people and more and more people will
[44:57] join this uh movement and we uh we
[45:01] understand that uh what Bitcoin is it is
[45:05] uh what is try to uh what it try to
[45:08] solve the problem what the problem is
[45:11] actually is so maybe the regul uh
[45:14] Regulators can understand uh why the
[45:18] self cting matters and the what's the
[45:22] problem of the our current uh system is
[45:26] so
[45:27] and I I'm personally I'm really um I uh
[45:34] I I I think in the Futures more and more
[45:36] people uh will join into uh this
[45:40] movement will truly understand what the
[45:43] self custody is what the Bitcoin is and
[45:47] more and more people will understand
[45:49] that yeah I definitely hope so I been
[45:52] the more self custody uh and I heard
[45:54] some crazy statistics like the most
[45:57] users on the Bitcoin blockchain uh have
[46:00] their Bitcoin in uh an exchange with a
[46:04] custodian but the most Bitcoin like the
[46:07] most value the most purchasing power of
[46:09] Bitcoin is actually in self- custody so
[46:12] like the the purchasing power and the uh
[46:15] the people that actually take care of
[46:17] the Bitcoin and have the bigger power of
[46:19] s of purchasing power are in self
[46:22] custody um but uh the The Exchange like
[46:26] the the just the sheer amount of users
[46:29] have uh so there's a lot of there's a
[46:31] big Market uh for for you basically of
[46:35] of people that uh need a s cast solution
[46:39] but they don't know it yet uh and that's
[46:41] why I appreciate everyone that builds
[46:44] something in the space that has some uh
[46:47] solution for Bitcoin in the space and
[46:50] develop something like you you putting
[46:53] your uh money and your energy into the
[46:56] Bitcoin ecosystem system uh no matter if
[46:59] it's developing a hardware wallet if
[47:01] it's uh being in Bitcoin exchange being
[47:03] a podcaster being an educator whatever
[47:06] you're doing you're contributing to the
[47:09] community and I think this is what is
[47:11] important the more and more people that
[47:12] do that uh the better it is and even
[47:15] like if you don't work in Bitcoin you
[47:17] can still uh contribute in in some sort
[47:20] of sense if you're working uh where you
[47:23] can buy it you can talk to the
[47:25] colleagues like there all was something
[47:28] you can do about it and and contribute
[47:31] and even if it's just watching this
[47:33] podcast it actually contributes because
[47:35] this shows YouTube okay people are
[47:36] interested in it and YouTube then
[47:39] distributes the podcast to more people
[47:41] like everything you do in the com a
[47:43] community is actually helping the
[47:45] community which is amazing to see yeah
[47:49] yeah um for the for the end of the
[47:52] podcast uh we before we end the podcast
[47:55] I I want to get to know like you outside
[47:59] of Bitcoin and S Cy and what you're
[48:00] doing Keystone uh what are you really
[48:03] passionate about uh what we did not
[48:05] touch on like is is there anything that
[48:07] you're currently reading in or currently
[48:09] really passionate about a topic that is
[48:12] not Bitcoin related cryptocurrency
[48:16] related uh I think for the uh crypto uh
[48:21] for the crypto base which is I uh my
[48:25] currently real a big interest uh from my
[48:29] perspect is the lightning n uh lightning
[48:32] Network and yeah I I'm a Bitcoin nurse I
[48:37] would like to use my Bitcoin to purchase
[48:40] things and to to do all kind of stuff
[48:43] into um yeah but but I I think in the
[48:47] Bas line it is really achieved that so
[48:51] the uh so our currently uh Community
[48:54] system uh solution is in uh Network so
[48:59] the lightning uh for me is really uh
[49:03] welld designed and really
[49:06] smart so uh probably I will not jump
[49:10] into the technical details of of
[49:12] lightning and I think what is lightning
[49:15] doing and what is can be achieved is
[49:18] really important for the uh not just for
[49:23] the Bitcoin Community but also for the
[49:25] whole uh cryp Community or even for the
[49:29] uh whole human can so uh and I would
[49:33] really uh bullish about the lightning
[49:37] network is not just uh uh and meanwhile
[49:41] I think that currently there are a lot
[49:43] of um Innovations H uh happening onto
[49:48] the uh lating lightning Network there
[49:51] are people are thinking to issue the St
[49:53] coins on the net so they can use like
[49:56] the usds on are in the lightning Network
[49:59] or do the purchase I think that is the
[50:03] basically the really uh interesting and
[50:08] really um uh
[50:11] really um big areas of our uh Bitcoin
[50:16] communities and our crypto space and
[50:19] with that I I think that the um with the
[50:22] lightning Network and with uh the whole
[50:25] B the whole things into that uh the the
[50:30] whole crypto space or the we call the
[50:34] web rward can really enter the uh next
[50:39] area so probably more and more peoples
[50:42] will into the space and to uh to to use
[50:46] the uh our to use the blockchain and use
[50:49] the uh crypto to into their uh their
[50:53] daily line and meanwhile uh uh and
[50:58] really um really my big another big
[51:02] interest currently is the AI stock I
[51:05] think the uh the the the the mine
[51:08] learning and U the thei stuff are really
[51:12] have uh Dramatics uh dramatically
[51:15] involved in the recent years um but
[51:19] currently drawing uh my daily work I use
[51:23] the t54 as my code assistant to help me
[51:27] to do a bunch of stuff and I I so
[51:32] another uh area I'm thinking the how we
[51:35] can com uh combine the uh AI with the uh
[51:40] blockchain or web three together and how
[51:45] we can if there are any possibilities we
[51:48] can like uh make the agent can uh do
[51:53] this stuff uh with the cryptocurrencies
[51:56] and uh um from my P personal perspective
[52:01] I think these two big areas can be
[52:04] intersection in some lels so uh another
[52:08] uh big interest of my another my
[52:11] personal big interest is I try to
[52:14] explore um a lot of new things for the
[52:20] interception between the AI and the
[52:22] blockchain stuff so that that basically
[52:25] the two things
[52:27] uh I was thinking and and meanwhile I
[52:31] think that uh there are another things I
[52:35] try I'm try to
[52:37] exploring uh specifically for the
[52:39] Bitcoin communities is the potential of
[52:42] the tap rot I think tap rot uh stuff is
[52:46] really um is really important for the
[52:50] Bitcoin Community because uh uh with the
[52:54] tab rout basically you can do a lot of
[52:57] new stuff um with the potential of uh
[53:02] how the tap rout can introduce so that
[53:05] is our area I'm currently thinking uh
[53:09] into uh into the the Bitcoin involvement
[53:13] and the Bitcoin development
[53:16] yeah uh wonderful and uh I love it and
[53:20] uh I mean there's there's one question I
[53:22] think I feel like I have to ask uh
[53:25] because we I have uh Bitcoin kind of
[53:29] only podcast I rarely invite people
[53:32] outside of the Bitcoin world uh with
[53:34] Hardware wallets uh it's it's more
[53:36] complicated because hard wallets all
[53:39] almost always also include other
[53:41] cryptocurrencies so make a little
[53:43] Exceptions there um but what do you
[53:46] think of like altcoins and uh because a
[53:49] lot of bitcoiners are like okay all the
[53:50] stuff that is currently in the altcoin
[53:53] market could maybe also be just built on
[53:55] top of Bitcoin coin uh and then there's
[53:58] like this debate is the alcoy market
[54:01] actually really decentralized is there
[54:04] not like if the state actually is
[54:07] attacking some of the altcoins uh it
[54:09] could be probably shut down where
[54:11] Bitcoin actually Prov from
[54:13] decentralization um what do you think of
[54:15] like this this whole uh altcoin versus
[54:19] Bitcoin and this this debate or where do
[54:21] you see also the dominance from from
[54:23] from Bitcoin going in the future
[54:27] okay so uh personally I'm a bitcoiner so
[54:30] I only so I only have Bitcoin I do not
[54:34] have any uh altcoins on my hand so my
[54:38] true my only belief and true belief is
[54:41] is Bitcoin that's actually I'm hard to
[54:45] call myself like the Bitcoin Ma modist
[54:48] I'm a bitcoiner and also I'm really uh
[54:51] open to the uh altcoin or general
[54:55] purpose cryptocurrency space so uh I
[55:00] think that there are there are uh there
[55:02] are lot of uh invol um Innovation H
[55:07] happens on other uh crypto space like
[55:10] the like the uh like the etherum like
[55:14] the Sana they all have their um Pro uh
[55:18] they all have their um the reason why
[55:22] they exist so um
[55:26] I will put some of my time to explore
[55:30] how these altcoins involved and how they
[55:35] uh try to um solve the
[55:39] problem and um bring that thinking into
[55:43] my mind to to to to see um whether uh it
[55:49] is benefits for the Bitcoin or it is
[55:52] bulles so um B BAS
[55:57] basically um I I think Bitcoin is the uh
[56:01] is the store value in the crypto space
[56:05] so I think that uh that one is uh like
[56:11] no one can questions so everyone
[56:14] basically everyone no matter you are a
[56:17] etherum Max modist or salana Max modist
[56:21] you are not questioning that Bitcoin is
[56:23] store values and
[56:27] uh for the other crypto uh uh for the
[56:32] other cryptocurrency projects I'm will
[56:35] put some my uh insights onto them and
[56:38] try to understand uh their underneath
[56:41] how the te uh how the uh technical
[56:44] details into that space so probably from
[56:48] my perspective if I see a a project um
[56:52] maybe I was think okay this is not truly
[56:55] decentralized and and uh maybe it has
[56:58] some um some um uh some questions I I
[57:04] have some doubts about that but uh I
[57:08] think uh in the meanwhile they can all
[57:11] they can also uh bring some insights
[57:15] into the Bitcoin communities so um
[57:17] probably we can learn something from uh
[57:20] from it or probably we can um uh we can
[57:26] get some insights from uh from from
[57:29] their perspective
[57:31] yeah yeah definitely and I feel I feel
[57:34] like um uh when they have value over the
[57:38] long run they will have some kind of
[57:41] price and they have some value if they
[57:43] proven to not have value over a long
[57:45] period of time I'm talking like 10 20
[57:48] years then they will go to zero like the
[57:50] free market will take care of that uh I
[57:54] personally just like yourself I only put
[57:56] my money in in Bitcoin and why that's
[57:59] why I'm only talking about Bitcoin
[58:01] because I only have money in Bitcoin
[58:02] like if if I would have if I don't have
[58:05] money uh in in ethereum I I don't want
[58:09] to talk about ethereum because that
[58:11] would be like weird if someone that
[58:13] don't even has e eum talks about bit
[58:16] ethereum so like that's why I'm focusing
[58:18] also on on bitcoin only uh but of course
[58:21] like I also don't see any value in like
[58:24] art for example like if if so some some
[58:27] painting that uh looks like some some
[58:31] kid uh painted it uh and they're paying
[58:35] Millions for it
[58:38] like just just like I really don't
[58:42] understand what
[58:43] the uh means uh actually uh I'm not
[58:48] invol I'm not I'm really uh not
[58:52] understand what the M uh this MF project
[58:55] so but it it uh so the free market can
[59:01] decide its value of it so all automat
[59:04] personal uh Al myself can do not
[59:07] understand that does not does Al uh do
[59:09] not mean that it is not have the uh
[59:12] value to exist so
[59:15] yeah 100% free market will will take
[59:18] care of that and as as the same with art
[59:21] um we have an endro te where the
[59:23] previous guest is asking a question for
[59:25] the next guest
[59:26] on today it's an interesting one um what
[59:30] question do you have for Robin like the
[59:33] previous guest asked what to you what
[59:35] questions do you have for me uh if you
[59:39] understood that um so like uh what do
[59:42] you have a question for me
[59:45] Aaron yeah so which is your uh favorite
[59:49] Hare
[59:51] wallet you're putting me on the spot why
[59:54] and why
[59:57] um so like I try to uh um avoid talking
[60:02] about what like what personal setup I
[60:05] have uh and I have like like what like
[60:09] exact solution I have I really like the
[60:12] Keystone wallet like it's has a
[60:13] touchcreen and when I gave it like uh to
[60:16] my girlfriend also because I have a
[60:18] keystone wallet at home H she was like
[60:21] she could do something with it uh so
[60:24] that's like I think a huge bonus with it
[60:27] like to have some touch screen on that
[60:29] or at least like at least have a display
[60:32] for me it's like uh a harder wallet that
[60:35] does not have a display it's not good
[60:37] like it at least has to have some kind
[60:40] of a display uh and for the the current
[60:44] sponsor of this podcast is the the um
[60:48] hard wallet that I usually recommend to
[60:50] especially new guys and uh new people in
[60:53] the in the sphere the bitbox uh that got
[60:56] me started in the whole fear but once
[60:59] you have a lot of uh more wealth in in
[61:04] the Bitcoin uh in more wealth in in
[61:06] Bitcoin you have to think of a lot of
[61:08] different things anyways and you have to
[61:11] uh really have to be thoughtful of your
[61:13] security especially like as myself when
[61:16] you're outspoken bitcoiner and that's
[61:19] for like four years straight uh so when
[61:22] you're outspoken and in the public and
[61:23] you're like the Bitcoin guy uh then you
[61:26] have to take self cast to another level
[61:29] and I always try to get all the insights
[61:33] I can I can get on all the different
[61:36] wallets uh and uh try out a lot of them
[61:40] I think I have like seven
[61:42] wallets that that that don't do anything
[61:45] like seven wallets that I don't use just
[61:48] because I I try to like okay how is this
[61:51] is that uh good because also people ask
[61:54] me okay what what wallet do you prefer
[61:57] and I think like it's important that as
[62:00] I said in the beginning depending on
[62:02] what level you are on you need a
[62:04] different wallet so that is like uh is
[62:08] it easy to use how how is the how is the
[62:11] feel to it uh and uh then when you come
[62:14] to multi signature then you can try to
[62:18] combine different wallets like you can
[62:22] that is really
[62:23] important exactly yeah from the uh motor
[62:28] perspective I think uh choosing the
[62:31] different uh Hardware wallet to work
[62:33] together is really crucial so you cannot
[62:37] put all your uh if you are using the
[62:39] motor but you only choose like one kind
[62:43] of device so that is really uh that is
[62:46] not a good options to do that so that is
[62:49] uh what we are thinking that uh modisc
[62:53] is really um the mod is really important
[62:58] for the Bitcoin communities and
[63:00] meanwhile if you would like to adopt the
[63:03] mod Solutions you should choose a
[63:06] different kind of Hardware or Wallet
[63:08] work together to to to to do that that
[63:11] can dramatically increase the security
[63:14] level of your
[63:17] M yeah perfect yeah this is exactly what
[63:20] what I'm also thinking no matter if you
[63:22] have like two out of three three out of
[63:24] five four out of seven and whatever the
[63:27] the setup is um try to have like
[63:30] multiple different kind of devices and
[63:33] try to like have the basic the basic
[63:36] thing that I'm always thinking is like
[63:38] try to think of attack vectors that a
[63:41] hacker could attack you and eliminate
[63:44] all that you can
[63:46] eliminate yeah yeah so that's that's I
[63:49] think the the basic thing that you can
[63:52] can do and there's a lot of things uh
[63:55] that you can do but the best thing is um
[63:58] go out there and educate yourself like
[64:00] go on the Keystone wallet website see
[64:03] what they all about go on other how
[64:06] wallet manufacturers see what they're
[64:08] all about read your reviews read uh from
[64:11] other people's opinion try try to really
[64:13] grasp like what is the the good thing
[64:15] for me and and that's what I basically
[64:17] try also do with the podcast I do a
[64:19] podcast every day and have a different
[64:23] guest on every day of the year
[64:26] uh which is fascinating to see when uh
[64:30] there are so many different opinions on
[64:32] one topic it's Bitcoin uh there are so
[64:36] many different opinions uh on that and I
[64:38] try to have like the widest range uh of
[64:41] of guests and opinions on on that one uh
[64:44] subject and I hope I hope I do a good
[64:46] job for my Watchers and viewers uh time
[64:49] will tell if I get more subscribers and
[64:51] more watch time people obviously like it
[64:53] if I get less people don't like it then
[64:55] I have to do something different so
[64:57] thank you for everyone watching and
[64:59] subscribing and thank you Aon also for
[65:02] for being on the show I appreciate your
[65:04] time and your insights to to the keyson
[65:06] harder wallet but also like generally to
[65:08] to harder wallets um when people want to
[65:11] find out more about you when people want
[65:13] to get in touch with you ask your
[65:15] questions uh how can people uh reach you
[65:19] yeah uh uh you can get me on the uh
[65:22] Twitter which is uh which is AR I think
[65:28] and probably I will send the link to you
[65:31] so if you have any questions about the
[65:34] uh Bitcoin wallet or the hardware wallet
[65:37] and especially for the keystones you can
[65:39] directly P me or if you developers you
[65:42] are really interested uh in uh our
[65:45] project everything we uh so every line
[65:49] about uh our code or weite is true is
[65:53] fully open source so you can um raise
[65:57] that issue if you found anything um you
[65:59] would like to understand you can raise
[66:01] that issue in our GitHub and meanwhile
[66:05] you can directly uh send the message me
[66:09] on Twitter yeah DM me

[66:21] thank you for being on Ain was a
[66:24] pleasure yeah the really happy to uh to
[66:27] talk about you and talk about the
[66:29] hardware wallet uh yes it's really uh
[66:33] thank you for the invitations
