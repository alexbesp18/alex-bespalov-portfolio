[00:00] Bitcoin is popular a economics gets to
[00:02] become popular again the less
[00:04] competition there isn't money the more
[00:06] competition you can have based on
[00:09] [Music]
[00:12] money you call yourself the the last
[00:15] Austrian Austrian economics uh in the
[00:18] direct tradition uh what do you mean by
[00:21] by that and the direct tradition well
[00:24] the auster school uh is just a school in
[00:27] the sense of being a tradition being
[00:29] start by Carl minger then Carl minger
[00:31] had students who had students so had
[00:33] students and so on student doesn't
[00:37] necessarily refer to an academic uh
[00:40] student uh but the most well-known part
[00:43] of AUST economics has been within
[00:45] Academia uh professors and the like uh I
[00:49] I was lucky to learn in Vienna from the
[00:52] last members of the other Austrian
[00:55] schools there are quite a few Austrian
[00:57] schools or VI schools the School of
[01:00] Economics had completely disappeared in
[01:02] Via uh but fortunately at my time there
[01:05] were two uh German speaking Austrian
[01:08] economists uh one has died since and was
[01:12] father who was a student of haek and the
[01:16] only one at my time who wrote German
[01:19] about the Austrian School of Economics
[01:21] still continued it as it own distinct
[01:23] tradition uh and uh then other on the
[01:27] other side of the ocean I was op uh was
[01:31] a student of mar Roth Park who was a
[01:34] most important American student of Rises
[01:36] what moved there
[01:38] and H has since left the US and also
[01:42] moved back to to Europe at least dep
[01:44] part interesting and but when I studied
[01:47] economics in uh Vienna uh there was no
[01:51] Austrian economics present uh uh So
[01:54] within Austria I mean the few people now
[01:57] will Endor Austrian economics of course
[02:00] everywhere but the time when I was a
[02:02] student uh I found I I was the only one
[02:05] really having an interest uh pursuing it
[02:08] uh puring it all career I've been
[02:10] teaching at universities for a long time
[02:13] now uh and I tried my best to continue
[02:16] that
[02:17] tradition it's funny when you think
[02:19] about it that in Austria in the
[02:22] universities They Don't Really teach
[02:25] Austrian economics in an Austrian in an
[02:28] Austrian University
[02:30] why did that um die or why did that kind
[02:34] of vanish from the mainstream
[02:37] universities why almost every scientific
[02:40] tradition disappeared out of Austria or
[02:43] Vienna uh Vienna before the wars was
[02:46] among the five biggest most important
[02:49] cities in the world and was a cultural
[02:52] center scientific center Financial
[02:54] Center uh it would be comparable to Shai
[02:58] New York uh s Singapore uh Dubai of
[03:02] today in in its importance in the
[03:05] terrible destruction of the
[03:07] terrible 20 uh 31st Century uh 20th
[03:11] century happened with the world wars
[03:14] totalitarianism so most either left or
[03:17] the tradition died out or or the
[03:19] corupted uh and economics uh is of
[03:22] particular importance because uh it has
[03:24] a relation to politics and the way we
[03:27] live together or politicians at least
[03:29] see in economics one of the most
[03:32] important scien is to control uh to push
[03:35] narratives that serve their interests
[03:38] and so that has happened of course the
[03:40] Nazis picked Lo for Mees of one of the
[03:43] most important enemies even before we
[03:46] had the accession uh of Austria to Nazi
[03:49] Germany they raided his apartment and
[03:51] they tried to kidnap his wife to get him
[03:54] because he could get out in in time uh
[03:58] that shows you and then after the war
[04:00] there were quite a few efforts in
[04:02] particular bahay to bring back uh the
[04:04] remaining members of the austrial school
[04:06] Vienna or Austria the least and their
[04:09] Austrian politics at the time tried
[04:11] everything to make that impossible it's
[04:14] it's kind of sad to to see that but is
[04:17] is um where would you say is Austrian
[04:20] economics the the most popular in the
[04:22] world uh I I I I don't feel it's in
[04:25] Austria even though I live here but but
[04:27] maybe in other words was not that
[04:30] popular but there like what would you
[04:32] say is now kind of the center of a
[04:34] economics still I mean the US was very
[04:37] important uh in sense of popularity
[04:39] probably it's Argentina and Brazil these
[04:43] days as a kind of counter reaction
[04:45] because uh in the west Europe and the US
[04:48] for many people there's not enough
[04:50] pressure yet existential pressure to to
[04:54] uh figure out that the kind of
[04:56] socialistic experiments are really
[04:58] costly so they're still open to all kind
[05:01] of nonsense uh
[05:03] policies uh whereas in countries and in
[05:06] particular for example in the former
[05:08] Eastern Europe uh that's also by
[05:10] Austrian economics is more popular the
[05:13] largest audience in Europe I have been
[05:16] teaching Austrian economics to was in
[05:18] Mar Poland where a thousand people
[05:21] otherwise it's usually just the hundreds
[05:23] the most uh that are into that that come
[05:26] to the conference of any year and uh the
[05:29] these days of course most new interest
[05:32] is triggered either by Bitcoin so it's
[05:35] where Bitcoin is popular a economics
[05:37] gets to become popular again then for
[05:40] history it's it's the us because that's
[05:43] where the ausans scho survive does a
[05:45] distinct tradition um and then it's
[05:47] countries that have recent experiences
[05:50] with
[05:50] socialism uh that's where the a
[05:54] moves is is the US um the closest to
[05:58] Austrian economics or is it is Argentina
[06:01] now coming closer to that because of
[06:03] chvy M or how does this work I don't
[06:05] really it's question you mean by closest
[06:09] uh uh politics uh is a thing that
[06:12] attracts attention that's unfortunate uh
[06:15] I think it's
[06:16] overrated but if you have politician
[06:19] that really helps a lot and for the US
[06:21] uh even though the a who survived almost
[06:24] no no one knew much about it so it was
[06:28] still more popular still more like
[06:30] traditions surviving but it was only one
[06:33] all really and it was the pressure of
[06:36] the financial crisis that turned the
[06:38] interest towards Austrian economics uh
[06:41] in the US again uh so then it became a
[06:44] bit more viral it was the lead to
[06:46] politics uh and in Argentina of course
[06:49] you have a very popular politician uh
[06:52] with surprisingly high appr ratings uh
[06:55] or in El Salvador with even higher appr
[06:58] ratings K has too much for Austrian
[07:01] economics uh but at least for Bitcoin uh
[07:05] uh that explains part of increasing
[07:08] popularity I I think it's a bit
[07:10] unfortunate
[07:11] symptom uh but that's way it is uh
[07:15] politics really triggers your interest
[07:17] so if Trump endorses something that
[07:20] triggers interest uh and that's the way
[07:23] it is it's interesting for me also El
[07:25] Salvador because I mean they don't say
[07:29] every currency can freely compete in in
[07:32] the country uh they really want to push
[07:34] Bitcoin uh and it seems like chff M
[07:37] wants to go a different route where each
[07:39] just wants to have free competition
[07:41] between the currencies and let the the
[07:43] free market decide I feel like the the
[07:45] Argentina way is more the the austan
[07:49] economics uh way and neuk wants to
[07:53] try kind of a country as a startup and
[07:56] wants to push Bitcoin and attract a
[07:58] talent that of
[08:00] I disagree yeah uh I think the
[08:03] unfortunate reason is that M has
[08:06] not as almost every other academic aan
[08:10] Economist or and academic H later on
[08:14] turn to asan economics like almost every
[08:17] Austrian economics professor there is uh
[08:20] and yeah he has not understood by yet so
[08:23] hopefully he win one day uh so that uh
[08:27] explains the the line of having
[08:29] competition actually uh no in money uh
[08:33] it's a network but uh the less
[08:36] competition there isn't money the more
[08:38] competition you can have based on money
[08:41] uh so I think it would be a a really bad
[08:44] idea to now have thousands of altcoins
[08:47] compete in the country and be very open
[08:49] to that kind of competition in order to
[08:51] figure out which is the better money uh
[08:54] which say no it's people deciding you
[08:56] don't organize that kind of competition
[08:59] you can can stop of course
[09:00] discriminating but that's usually a
[09:03] reason that you say uh you what kind of
[09:06] Coury uh and in both countries the
[09:09] dollar is quite prominent uh and for
[09:13] most people for day-to-day transactions
[09:15] for Savings of the T stable value
[09:19] relative uh or the stable coin thing is
[09:23] actually the preferred usage so Bitcoin
[09:25] is a savings technology mainly for now
[09:28] uh and and that doesn't bring a really
[09:31] seure in that kind
[09:33] ofation yeah uh that seems to be really
[09:37] it's it's interesting how the those
[09:39] countries that have a hyper inflating
[09:42] currency like artino or turkey they then
[09:45] flee to the to the uh not as broken
[09:49] money as like the US dollar or maybe a
[09:52] stable coin on usdc or something like
[09:54] that uh and not directly to bitcoin but
[09:57] it it seems like they they make like the
[09:59] the middle step and and maybe um wants
[10:03] the the US dollar is do you see that
[10:05] fear to completely erod long long term
[10:08] that that fear completely breaks or will
[10:10] there always be government issued money
[10:12] yeah I mean I wouldn't count on it
[10:14] disappearing soon I think it's
[10:16] absolutely possible yes I think this
[10:19] vision of having layer money base layer
[10:23] is Bitcoin is possible in particular in
[10:26] the worlds that split rocks where we
[10:29] need to politically neutral money or
[10:31] would need to be neutral money for a
[10:33] kind of big settlements uh between rocks
[10:36] for example for worldwide trade so of
[10:39] course that makes sense you'll always
[10:41] have politicians try to M up money uh
[10:44] and people come up and also private
[10:46] scamers coming up with new concepts of
[10:49] money of course it's the appeal of ining
[10:52] money controlling money is just one of
[10:55] the most leeding schemes to enriching
[10:57] yourself uh and new PR so that probably
[11:01] won't disappear uh but I think the world
[11:04] may settle into something better with
[11:06] the dollar uh and let's hope that the
[11:09] dollar is not suceeded by another fiat
[11:13] currency of block uh of countries uh so
[11:18] I think there's hope for that so I think
[11:20] for the short to medium term of course
[11:23] people prefer in the day transactions
[11:27] not to have the volatility of the
[11:29] savings asset still appreciates a lot
[11:31] that's why we don't use like real estate
[11:35] denominated uh things and stuff maybe um
[11:40] or stocks uh as payent uh so it's still
[11:44] a discovery procedure uh to find what
[11:47] What's um more or less fair but seems
[11:50] like a fair price for something so for
[11:53] now there is much more usage of St
[11:55] points if
[11:56] you crypto spirit as a whole uh and even
[12:00] Bitcoin linking State coins and linking
[12:03] uh to other assets we become more
[12:06] important and M just replace this cenes
[12:11] say very cool and I think uh I missed
[12:15] that question before I think in in the
[12:18] Bitcoin Community the thought of aan
[12:20] economics and what aan economics is is
[12:22] quite WID spread but there's probably
[12:25] always someone in the audience that
[12:27] doesn't know what aan economics actually
[12:28] is I know I remember myself when I came
[12:31] into Bitcoin I thought it is actually
[12:33] the economics in Austria which I was
[12:35] confused about why people all around the
[12:38] world talk about Austria um for people
[12:40] who don't know um what is Austrian
[12:44] economics and how is it different to the
[12:45] other school of thoughts and and and how
[12:47] would you describe that it's a realist
[12:51] tradition that used to be very
[12:53] interdisciplinary and focus on the real
[12:58] people who are individuals and uh for
[13:01] whom uh almost every economic
[13:05] interaction starts with something
[13:07] subjective an idea a preference a
[13:10] belief uh so it's figuring out the
[13:13] things that look very important and
[13:14] physical and have an impact actually
[13:16] start with something that's very
[13:18] invisible individual subjective uh and
[13:21] it's part of the realism so it's not
[13:23] utopian it's not idealist aan economics
[13:26] is a very realist economics uh a
[13:29] tradition of Economics uh that looks
[13:32] into real people and how they interact
[13:34] and uh they figured out that uh even
[13:38] things that uh are very physical and
[13:40] have impact in the world in economics
[13:42] they all start with subjective
[13:44] individual preferences beliefs ideas and
[13:47] are invisible so it's hard to deal with
[13:50] the methods of the Natural Sciences uh
[13:52] with that kind of interaction it's a
[13:54] complex phenomenon that we have emerging
[13:57] from those individual preferences and
[13:59] actions um and uh actually um aan
[14:03] economics was a more
[14:05] interdisciplinary uh approach because it
[14:07] emerged with a lot of other Traditions
[14:09] at the same time um which was part of
[14:13] kind of Austrian Enlightenment I'd say
[14:15] uh of flourishing of Science and culture
[14:18] uh in a very central part of Europe at
[14:20] the time uh and trying to understand a
[14:24] society in crisis uh which it was
[14:27] already then and uh uh many uh members
[14:31] of the a were very prophetic uh because
[14:34] they saw where the societies would
[14:37] develop into and what then became
[14:39] unavoidable the great destruction of
[14:41] Europe uh during the 20 interesting is
[14:44] um with realism do you mean that um a
[14:49] economics is the natural way of
[14:51] economics and the other school of
[14:52] thoughts try to manipulate with the
[14:56] natural way of how economics should work
[14:59] less difficult now I wouldn't say
[15:01] natural means what comes to people
[15:04] naturally uh and yes it's a kind of
[15:06] Common Sense approach but then also it's
[15:09] very natural with us to follow
[15:12] Collective
[15:14] ideas and more this kind of idealism uh
[15:17] and the tribal instincts we have uh so
[15:21] in that sense it's not very natural
[15:23] because it appreciates uh an very
[15:26] extended order complex order of people
[15:29] that don't know each other
[15:31] interacting uh and and uh so it's
[15:33] unnatural for most people the kind of
[15:35] economy that's described and appreciated
[15:38] so this extended Market order seems to
[15:41] be
[15:42] unnatural uh for our instincts that have
[15:45] shaped in millions of years of tribal
[15:47] life um but yes from the methodology I
[15:51] think it's more natural in the sense
[15:53] it's Common Sense approach if you can
[15:57] have your senses in that sense of the
[16:00] reason looking at things uh and uh don't
[16:04] have like emotions or interests that are
[16:07] too strong so unfortunately it's more
[16:10] natural usually that people have an
[16:12] interest first and then they look for
[16:14] ideas to rationalize
[16:16] them uh and Austrian economics triy to
[16:19] be value neutral that was the original
[16:22] approach now most uh of today's popular
[16:26] Austrian economics does not follow that
[16:28] approach because it's so difficult I
[16:30] mean we all have interest that's again
[16:32] evolutionary we struggle for survival so
[16:35] we are looking for ideas that fit our
[16:38] interests for survival um and uh
[16:41] Austrian economics said no let's start
[16:44] first by understanding and then judging
[16:47] let's not start with preconceived ideas
[16:50] how things should be but let's first
[16:52] understand how things really are and
[16:54] then we can talk about how they should
[16:56] be but most Focus uh is on having an
[16:59] approach to the world that is neutral
[17:02] from your point of view from your
[17:04] interests your values your
[17:06] beliefs it's interesting um I talk a lot
[17:09] on the podcast on like what impact um
[17:13] Bitcoin has if Bitcoin is successful in
[17:15] in the long run on what uh impact a
[17:19] world on a Bitcoin standard would have
[17:20] on on on people and on society level uh
[17:23] but in general if we even go one step
[17:26] further what impact does uh and
[17:29] different economic system a different uh
[17:32] money have on on on people uh when it's
[17:35] implemented money is crucial and
[17:37] underrated by most people it's a
[17:40] protocol and it's a protocol that allows
[17:43] cooperation of lots of people who don't
[17:46] know each other and don't trust each
[17:47] other in particular if it's a final
[17:49] settlement uh monetary protocol so of
[17:53] course in the Fiat structure that's one
[17:55] of the issues that they necessitate a
[17:57] lot of trust in institutions and third
[18:00] parties and so on and that of course
[18:02] hinders uh this function of being a
[18:05] protocol for corporations still it
[18:07] somehow is working with all the
[18:10] distortions uh but we don't know for how
[18:13] long so that's uh money is the crucial
[18:16] link that brings up cataly that's the
[18:19] name of Austrian Economist for the
[18:21] extended order that brings about wealth
[18:23] most of the wealth we take for granted
[18:25] has appeared very recently and it's due
[18:28] to money money making possible this kind
[18:31] of division of labor and interaction
[18:33] cooperation of so many people that don't
[18:36] have to know uh what they are involved
[18:39] in uh but do their little part try to be
[18:42] useful valuable to the world uh and then
[18:46] uh by a spontaneous procedure uh add
[18:49] into that giant wealth generation
[18:51] machine uh that the world has turned
[18:54] into there's this book I I recently
[18:56] interviewed an appleberg uh uh who had
[18:59] the book uh how was it called abundance
[19:02] through scarcity or something like that
[19:04] um there this idea that that uh Bitcoin
[19:06] will bring more wealth and more
[19:08] abundance uh to to the world um is is
[19:11] that a fair assumption if if Bitcoin
[19:13] succeeds that the whole world um will
[19:17] get more wealth and more advanced and
[19:19] more uh rich in
[19:22] nature yes I don't like utopian ideas in
[19:25] a sense overpromise uh too much but yes
[19:28] if it really turns out to be a better
[19:31] monetary protocol then yes it should
[19:33] bring about more cooperation and more
[19:36] abundance uh abundance is not due to
[19:40] like of course producing more money so
[19:42] that's obvious L there scarer money
[19:45] maybe better
[19:47] money uh and allowing more people to
[19:50] save will allow for better Capital
[19:52] allocations uh in the future less
[19:55] distorted ones uh it should bring more
[19:59] abundant in the sense of having the
[20:02] subjective preferences of people being
[20:06] more fulfilled or more satisfied so they
[20:09] can go on to higher preferences it will
[20:12] not mean I think it's very unlikely it
[20:14] means it leads to Greater abundance of
[20:17] goods and
[20:19] gadgets okay so I'm not sure about that
[20:22] I think it lead to higher wealth now
[20:24] wealth for the Austrian School is
[20:25] defined in a very neutral subjective way
[20:28] as everything else it means people have
[20:32] preferences and uh if they can satisfy
[20:35] more of these preferences they are
[20:37] wealthier that's just term for it if
[20:41] people have the preferences to have
[20:44] actually less but better quality stuff
[20:48] if they prefer to have a simpler but
[20:50] better life if they prefer to spend more
[20:52] time with the families kids have
[20:55] families they' all be wealthy they may
[20:58] have less gadgets and goods
[21:00] uh but they'd be wealthier and I think
[21:04] yes that's the main appeal of Bitcoin is
[21:06] not producing more abundance in the
[21:08] sense of having even more uh Goods
[21:11] around us to choose from which is a
[21:14] great thing that you're able to choose
[21:15] but for many people it it feels a bit
[21:18] Shale more and more uh and I think the
[21:21] reason is the distortions the great
[21:23] distortions that the productive
[21:24] structures are not in good link uh to
[21:27] our preference are actual
[21:30] preferences uh the decision making is
[21:33] distorted by Fiat about what should be
[21:36] produced it's a great Insight by ludik F
[21:38] mes that actually money is a daily uh
[21:42] decision making process of every cent
[21:44] you spend or don't spend decides on
[21:47] what's getting produced in the future uh
[21:50] but with the current money we have it
[21:52] doesn't matter your sense really don't
[21:54] matter because more and more votes in
[21:57] that great ballot box are produced every
[22:00] day uh then you can decide on so your
[22:03] vote doesn't count and then of course
[22:05] there may be lots of stuff uh but lot of
[22:08] stuff may just be an appeasement to make
[22:10] you forget that your vote actually
[22:13] doesn't coin your voice doesn't coin
[22:15] account uh in the productive structure
[22:17] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[22:19] a regular basis I guess you already
[22:22] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[22:24] important step is to keep the Bitcoin

[23:52] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[23:56] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[23:58] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[24:02] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[24:04] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[24:08] watch collections you have the date of
[24:11] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[24:14] there and of course also the block
[24:16] height and which EPO we are currently in
[24:20] I love the level of detail they put in
[24:22] in this masterpiece and make sure to

[24:30] love those watches so so much it feels
[24:34] like that that more stuff and more Goods
[24:37] it's like a feat mindset like we want to
[24:39] produce more and more and uh I see that
[24:41] in the Bitcoin Community where people
[24:43] are like the true wealth is like time
[24:46] time with your family reproduce and all
[24:48] those things like that's that seems to
[24:50] be the the consensus under the the real
[24:54] bitcoiners and and the other things is
[24:56] more the the crypto cryp crypto world
[24:59] and the altcoin world or the shitcoin
[25:00] world how I like to call it um as you
[25:03] also long in in Bitcoin already and you
[25:06] Al said like they the first austan
[25:08] economics aan aan economics that the
[25:10] crash Bitcoin um how did the Bitcoin
[25:15] ecosystem evolved the last 15 years and
[25:18] what role do you think um uh it
[25:21] currently plays in in the world uh with
[25:24] a followup question then do like where
[25:27] do you see Bitcoin longterm the role
[25:29] playing yeah oh it changed a lot from
[25:33] being a niche that was not even taken
[25:36] seriously by Me by myself and most
[25:38] people of course I was bit too early uh
[25:42] so that uh took quite a while for an
[25:46] infrastructure around it to emerge uh
[25:49] and more and more people adopting it uh
[25:52] and it has changed in a tremendous way
[25:54] now the latest stage we're at it's a
[25:56] Wall Street assets uh and can be part of
[25:59] any portfolio which is a good and a bad
[26:02] thing at the same time so there are two
[26:04] scenarios here uh and I think they'll
[26:06] work out the same way the one scenar is
[26:09] of course the kind of serious adoption
[26:11] in Asset Management it enters more
[26:13] portfolios that' be great for its price
[26:16] uh uh the bad scenario at the same time
[26:19] is uh the F fungibility issue arises
[26:22] again it has always been around with
[26:23] Bitcoin it was always my biggest worry
[26:25] from the beginning uh that uh will have
[26:29] potentially this kind of kyc
[26:32] ETF uh Wall Street linked Bitcoin uh
[26:37] which has the security uh like any other
[26:40] uh security heavily calized controled
[26:44] sensored who is allowed to use that when
[26:47] to use that and on the other side we
[26:50] have the old Bitcoin outside of the
[26:53] structures and the Two Worlds that are
[26:55] not that interoperable anymore that's a
[26:58] big danger uh but it has been around so
[27:02] I talking about that danger for a long
[27:03] time it hasn't really materialized
[27:05] Bitcoin is still useful it still Bridges
[27:08] the world uh it's still a barer asset
[27:11] outside of these structures it can be
[27:13] turned into a non-beer asset security
[27:17] like thing uh which has held its
[27:19] institutional adoption brings with it
[27:22] these dangers uh but more or less it's
[27:24] it's the process of uh maturing um as an
[27:28] asset class um and uh of course that's
[27:31] crucial that opens up savings
[27:33] Technologies to more
[27:35] people um uh and yeah I think that's
[27:38] that's underrated uh so it's a very
[27:41] exciting story uh that that we are
[27:44] observing H it's it's really interesting
[27:47] to to Really witness the the growth of
[27:49] Bitcoin and how it comes into more more
[27:52] products in more more hands also um and
[27:55] the ETF is really interesting since
[27:57] since the very beginning the ETFs came
[27:59] out and the American ETFs because in
[28:01] Europe we have ETP since I think 2015 or
[28:05] something like that since since a way
[28:06] longer time but as now America the big
[28:09] Financial Powerhouse of the world as I
[28:11] call it is now into Bitcoin all of the
[28:13] sudden that the the fuser on that um and
[28:16] I could also see like kind of like a
[28:20] order 6102 I think it was with the gold
[28:22] confiscation on bitcoin because a lot of
[28:25] the the Bitcoins uh from the ETFs and
[28:27] also from from institutional money uh
[28:29] and companies are on on coinbase and on
[28:32] some some exchanges yeah um but but
[28:35] could it be a long-term actual risk to
[28:38] bitcoin or is it just a risk for those
[28:40] who who have the Bitcoin not in uh in
[28:44] the in those accounts yes uh it's a risk
[28:48] but it has been a risk from the
[28:50] beginning uh in a sense uh and it's
[28:53] really that fear that if it's not
[28:54] punible anymore then you have different
[28:56] parts of bit
[28:58] coin uh and uh but we've been afraid
[29:02] about that for a long time it hasn't
[29:04] completely materialized when chain
[29:05] analysis was a thing I was really afraid
[29:08] that that would mean there will always
[29:10] be like painted Bitcoins and untainted
[29:13] Bitcoins and it'll be a big issue uh uh
[29:18] that hasn't materialized in that way I
[29:20] mean still it's a pain in yes but uh uh
[29:23] in in a way it has become that kind of
[29:26] compromise where I mean almost everyone
[29:29] should know that chain analysis is fake
[29:31] in the sense it's not what it seems to
[29:34] be but I shouldn't speak about it openly
[29:37] because a kind of compromise is accepted
[29:39] as approved technology check technology
[29:42] uh fortunately the compromise that has
[29:44] been found has not led to a great loss
[29:47] of fungibility of Bitcoin just a little
[29:50] loss uh and that for now has been okay
[29:53] and fine but yeah there have always been
[29:56] risks and Bitcoin is and an impossible
[29:58] miracle and from the Inception there
[30:01] always so strong reasons why it would
[30:03] fail why it would be risky uh and it has
[30:06] survived so many risks that in a sense
[30:08] it's anti has become anti fragile if you
[30:11] use that word so it may be that it
[30:15] survives that it's not killed by Wall
[30:17] Street but Wall Street is killed by
[30:19] Bitcoin who knows it's the Honeybadger
[30:21] thing uh definitely hope so uh really
[30:23] cool um I feel I feel like we are we we
[30:26] survived a lot of wars with within
[30:28] Bitcoin uh I mean the most popular I
[30:30] feel like is the the pl size War uh with
[30:33] within Bitcoin um
[30:37] but when you're along in Bitcoin the the
[30:40] most likely for Bitcoin to to go to go
[30:44] to zero because you didn't protect
[30:45] yourself uh against the risk factors you
[30:49] lost it you put it on Exchange you lost
[30:51] the keys whatever um how would you now
[30:54] uh tell the Bitcoin how to protect
[30:57] yourself the best against any of as as a
[31:01] bitcoiner what should you really um
[31:04] think about when protecting yourself
[31:06] against anything that can happen in the
[31:09] world maybe even Beyond Bitcoin MH oh
[31:12] yes uh that's one important Insight
[31:15] that's also linked to to some members of
[31:18] the ausan school of economics who found
[31:20] out early their real realist approach to
[31:23] the world showed them that geopolitics
[31:25] is something you better prepare by being
[31:30] we uh or looking at it as kind of
[31:32] natural catastrophes that can emerge uh
[31:36] so you have kind of insurance approach
[31:38] and that insurance approach is a multif
[31:39] flag strategy approach uh being a bit
[31:43] more mobile being less attached don't
[31:46] have your whole portfolio of for
[31:48] existence linked to one flag one Pol
[31:51] political structure so you try to become
[31:56] a bit more immune towards these changes
[31:59] uh so it's increased Mobility it's
[32:01] increased separation of parts of your
[32:04] existence it's of course making use of
[32:07] privacy uh and the value of privacy as
[32:10] an end in
[32:11] itself even um and this kind of
[32:15] portfolio approach means that you take
[32:18] precautions that may not become
[32:19] necessary and it's not one solution it's
[32:22] not one Utopia it's not like everyone go
[32:24] to that place do that kind of set up use
[32:27] that Hardware wallet
[32:28] no it's always a kind of spread out your
[32:31] risks have different kinds of wallet
[32:34] setups even it may become possible now
[32:36] depending on your Bitcoin stack uh it
[32:40] will may become possible to have
[32:42] different Stacks um kyc stack and a
[32:45] nonky SE stack of
[32:48] Bitcoin uh a stack that's separated from
[32:52] yourself because you bring it into
[32:54] company structures you may um so there
[32:58] may even be a reason to exchange Bitcoin
[33:00] for shares uh in some scenario just to
[33:04] make sure for any kind of risk that's
[33:06] linked to your existence uh because if
[33:09] you're immobile in one jurisdictions and
[33:11] people know about Bitcoin possessions
[33:14] and it appreciates and then uh you have
[33:17] a kind of prohibition or taxation events
[33:21] that suddenly emerge uh you should I
[33:23] mean be realist enough to take care uh
[33:27] and that may even mean spend some
[33:29] Bitcoin while it's able to do some good
[33:32] uh for yourself for other people for
[33:35] starting infrastructure building
[33:38] infrastructure around Bitcoin uh so it's
[33:41] a very multiac approach um and uh that
[33:45] you can call GE Arbitrage or a kind of
[33:48] insurance policy for any kind of
[33:50] scenario happening uh and I think it's
[33:53] good in a sense Bitcoin is part of an
[33:55] approach to the world that's activating
[33:57] it's not passive uh it's not something
[34:00] it's like a passive investment in that
[34:02] sense if you take ter of very active
[34:05] kind of investment because you still you
[34:08] have to continue learning uh you have to
[34:11] continue figuring out what are risk how
[34:14] to cope with them uh and just be very
[34:16] realist about it don't uh uh find refuge
[34:20] in the kind of utopia and thinking oh
[34:22] the like the Bitcoin country with
[34:24] Bitcoin City will open uh inless
[34:27] opportunities to me and I don't have to
[34:29] do anything about it but uh go there or
[34:33] uh or I me even change in my place with
[34:36] this Bitcoin politician he will
[34:39] finally solve all my problems uh I
[34:42] wouldn't suggest that our history
[34:44] suggest that we don't know it's deeply
[34:46] uncertain it's fundamentally uncertain
[34:48] don't have all your EGS in one basket
[34:51] absolutely yeah I'm a big fan of this
[34:53] idea that we spread out in decentralized
[34:56] citadels in the future and it's not like
[35:00] so centrally controlled and we we do we
[35:03] organize differently but it's it's hard
[35:05] to imagine right now it's it's hard to
[35:06] imagine with the political structure
[35:08] that we have right now to imagine
[35:10] anything changing in the in the near
[35:13] future uh it's happening it's it's
[35:15] happening already it's changing already
[35:18] I mean that strategy I just mentioned is
[35:20] of course a decentralization strategy
[35:23] and uh that has been going on for quite
[35:25] a while the amount of of people that are
[35:28] able to live as Perpetual tourists uh as
[35:31] a term uh has increased by Lots it's
[35:34] growing
[35:35] rapidly uh so there's already a kind of
[35:38] decentralization uh happening of more
[35:41] and more people having location
[35:42] independent incomes uh that's happening
[35:46] that are able to take Bitcoin payments
[35:49] uh for their work that's increasing and
[35:52] even the kind of Citadel idea it's of
[35:56] Industry that's growing rapidly we have
[35:59] uh already thousands and thousands of
[36:01] special economic zones and now we have
[36:03] lots of projects to try to get special
[36:05] administrative zones which means extra
[36:07] jurisdictions changes in jurisdictions
[36:10] friendly jurisdictions and is this whole
[36:12] idea if you have more mobile people then
[36:14] jurisdiction will start competing for
[36:16] the best uh to attract the best and uh
[36:19] bitcoiners are among the best usually
[36:22] they tend to be like honest uh long-term
[36:26] oriented people are saving and that's
[36:29] the kind of people you want to attract
[36:31] that are able to invest in the future uh
[36:35] that's have gone Rich through a get rich
[36:38] quick scheme and we lose everything
[36:40] immediately uh so we'll see more more
[36:43] competition for that we see a lot of
[36:46] bitcoiners thinking about how they want
[36:48] to live actually improve their life
[36:50] having families uh I work myself in a
[36:53] project and invest in it heavily to set
[36:57] up Bitcoin citadels or places
[36:59] decentralized places for families of
[37:01] bitcoiners uh and uh I'm not the only
[37:04] one attracted by that idea uh so there a
[37:08] lot is changing uh and uh it's getting
[37:11] more decentralized not yet for the mass
[37:14] of people but it's always the margin uh
[37:16] that's an inside of the Austrian School
[37:18] it's the few people that change that
[37:20] bring the change uh it doesn't take that
[37:23] many people it's like if the right
[37:25] people move or move their capital or are
[37:27] able to uh then that can just uh tilt uh
[37:32] B the right move the changes everything
[37:35] for everyone else for the
[37:37] better it feels like the the sovereign
[37:40] individual playing out in in real time
[37:42] Lo the book sov
[37:44] individual yes you know that pocket was
[37:47] not only predicting Bitcoin in a way it
[37:49] was also predicting this current of
[37:52] decentralized living uh and structures
[37:56] exactly and has been influenced by the
[37:58] Austrian School of course heavily it's
[38:00] cited with him uh B is cited frequently
[38:05] uh and it's has always been part of the
[38:07] Practical tradition of Austrian
[38:09] economics uh a long time before anyone
[38:12] else uh headed on the
[38:14] screen absolutely it's a really
[38:17] interesting uh interesting book also
[38:20] that that it came out like uh before
[38:22] Bitcoin I think it even came out before
[38:24] I was born in 1979 1997 or something
[38:27] like that uh really interesting uh to
[38:30] think about that and also for for me um
[38:34] the the idea of having not the
[38:37] centralized controller but having it
[38:39] decentralized and spreading out I love
[38:41] that a lot um besides what we already
[38:44] talked about is there another big
[38:47] societal impact that you think Bitcoin
[38:49] will have on on our lives is there
[38:51] something else that that Bitcoin will
[38:54] will impact that not only the people
[38:57] that already adop now bit consented but
[38:59] like the the whole world will will kind
[39:01] of notice yeah I mean the most important
[39:04] thing right now actually is the wars
[39:07] going on of course and uh for now I
[39:10] don't think that that soon we kind will
[39:13] help stop the financing of Wars uh it's
[39:17] a long-term thing but yes it's related
[39:20] to that of course if more people are
[39:22] able to save in a technology that cannot
[39:24] be used to finance Wars because you're
[39:27] able to to say no actually uh to that
[39:30] kind of Destruction and usage that's
[39:32] great that helps uh and we see already
[39:35] how this Mobility can have an impact uh
[39:38] even on decisions of war in peace but
[39:41] more importantly it's uh a potential
[39:45] link between blocks when money gets
[39:48] politicized we have lot of sanctions
[39:51] right now it's really difficult to
[39:53] cooperate with people that are in
[39:55] different blocks of the world uh
[39:57] and the fat system you all you start
[40:00] getting these containers like imprison
[40:03] you within a block so I think that's a
[40:07] potentially big change because it could
[40:09] Bridge people that are actually at War
[40:12] mentally for their education system for
[40:15] everything and allow them to cooperate
[40:17] and allow them to figure still figure
[40:19] out and not forget that those are also
[40:23] people and they will also prefer to have
[40:25] a win-win relationship uh to you uh but
[40:28] you're shut out uh from these parts of
[40:31] the world and then as a global uh
[40:35] neutral money it's I mean it's the hope
[40:38] that even when globalization goes down
[40:41] which may happen to the world breaking
[40:43] into blocks and the us becoming
[40:46] isolationist uh in in a sense uh which
[40:48] would be good on the geopolitical side
[40:51] but may bring the risk of a less
[40:53] integrated economy uh then Bitcoin is
[40:56] the only hope
[40:57] we have for the kind of global
[40:59] interaction and it's really crucial have
[41:01] access to places that are still Dynamic
[41:04] that you can go to Dubai it's kind of
[41:06] Center to Singapore that you can go to
[41:08] Southeast Asia uh where there's still a
[41:11] lot of
[41:12] upside of cooperation of win-win
[41:15] productivity and Link that to our
[41:18] experience otherwise most people in the
[41:20] west tend a bit frustrated if you're
[41:22] living with in Europe it may be that
[41:24] your outlook dark and so much because
[41:27] you only see how it's getting worse
[41:29] every year from a very high level of
[41:32] wealth and that has pushed me out of
[41:34] Austria of course this has mentality
[41:36] mindset has darkened so much almost
[41:39] every austan assumes that his children
[41:41] will have a life that's worse than what
[41:44] you're having now and then of course you
[41:45] don't have children uh and even though
[41:48] it's a higher level of wealth still
[41:50] comparatively it's the Outlook that's
[41:52] important uh and so bitcoiners can be
[41:56] more optimist uh and uh can have a
[42:01] broader approach to the world and the
[42:03] broader Horizon and it's important so
[42:06] it's this kind of optimism uh and
[42:08] connection that that's a main impact
[42:11] that Bitcoin May
[42:13] deliver I I love that uh there is a
[42:17] Bitcoin content on hope.com I I love
[42:21] that fact that Michael put put hope.com
[42:23] with with Bitcoin in connection because
[42:26] hope is such an amazing uh word also for
[42:29] for Bitcoin and what what it could bring
[42:31] um on that note what are in your opinion
[42:35] the the the best places right now to to
[42:37] live for for Bitcoin is obviously
[42:39] there's not that one best place for
[42:41] everyone because it's an individual
[42:42] decision and there's a lot of things to
[42:44] consider but for bitcoiners in general
[42:46] what are the places to to be yeah I
[42:48] would advise against looking for the
[42:50] perfect place because so many factors
[42:52] play in in particular the uncertainty of
[42:54] the future how things are going to
[42:56] develop I MO who would have bought
[42:59] scenarios uh Kev was a great place to
[43:02] live Lou was a great place to live until
[43:05] very recently even for in particular for
[43:09] bitcoiners uh I Lov those places I was
[43:12] involved in these places uh and and
[43:15] things of course can change uh so uh I
[43:19] think the best approach is uh as with
[43:23] Bitcoin uh you don't link yourself too
[43:25] much to one physical
[43:28] location identity but are open to
[43:30] explore others and uh then I think it's
[43:34] this kind of portfolio approach you
[43:35] don't you shouldn't be or it's not a
[43:38] good idea to like take a chob at the
[43:41] same location where you live where your
[43:43] nationality is from uh at your passport
[43:46] and so on uh so if you are still without
[43:51] family explore the world uh if you have
[43:54] family then it's more difficult that's
[43:56] one I'm working on to make that a bit
[43:59] easier uh but then you go for uh a
[44:03] realist approach if you need
[44:05] grandparents around you are with your
[44:07] grandparents if you have uh a job that
[44:11] you're happy about and brings value to
[44:13] the world and helps you to maintain a
[44:16] family then of course you stay with that
[44:18] don't just now uh let go of your job and
[44:22] move to the Bitcoin country uh just for
[44:25] a hope that too little that start
[44:28] exploring it start to figure out how you
[44:31] can be more independent once that
[44:34] situation the setup you have made worsen
[44:36] and where made worsen what happens when
[44:38] you lose your job you still have to pay
[44:40] back credit for a home and that's I
[44:43] think avoid that kind of Lifestyle with
[44:45] has become typical it's like you live in
[44:47] the country where you Bor where you have
[44:49] the passport from you pay taxes in that
[44:52] country you are dependent on the job
[44:54] because you live in a house that's
[44:56] financ like credits that you have to pay
[44:58] back from getting that job and then of
[45:00] course what happens to you you
[45:03] become
[45:04] uh you become angry and you become
[45:08] frustrated and Afraid and you're afraid
[45:10] to speak your mind you're afraid to
[45:12] change something uh and in particular if
[45:14] you have a family then the family life
[45:17] is your first priority because otherwise
[45:19] you destroy your family by now being uh
[45:24] panicking and like okay we got to leave
[45:27] everything alone it's a gradual process
[45:30] of getting your family along to have
[45:32] with you a better more independent setup
[45:36] uh and you have to compromise a lot if
[45:39] you're a single person still having
[45:41] nothing to lose okay that's that's fine
[45:44] if you're committed to projects to jobs
[45:46] to Enterprises to families to friends
[45:49] then be realist about it don't let you
[45:52] persuade that Bitcoin does not fix that
[45:55] even with Bitcoin you always have to
[45:57] compromise if you're in a relationship
[45:58] you have to compromise just don't
[46:00] compromise due to pressure and coercion
[46:03] that's the worst kind of compromise I
[46:05] only do it because or because I'm used
[46:07] to that uh you compromise because you
[46:10] find a more win-win way of flourishing
[46:13] in that world with all the challenges
[46:15] there are and you take an active
[46:17] approach to it that's the kind of
[46:18] compromising that great is a tradeoff in
[46:20] economics we call the tradeoff that's a
[46:22] very important concept there are no one
[46:25] size fits all Perfect Solutions for
[46:27] everyone we all individuals we all have
[46:29] subjective preferences problems ideas we
[46:32] have to find our unique spot in the
[46:35] world how we can contribute how we can
[46:37] flourish um and that means tradeoffs
[46:41] that means to know what you focus on
[46:43] what you don't focus on what you still
[46:44] want to explore it's always a trade off
[46:47] it's not never one answer and one
[46:50] perfect answer and and that also applies
[46:53] for the question where should I live uh
[46:55] just separated from all the other issues
[46:57] where you're living does not have to
[46:59] mean that's the place where all your
[47:01] existence is centered around you don't
[47:03] have to get a new invent a new identity
[47:06] because then it can be laring uh live
[47:09] action role playing and then you can as
[47:11] as well withdraw into a computer game uh
[47:14] or online world uh and it'll be the same
[47:17] thing it'll be a withdrawal from The
[47:19] Real World don't do that uh and uh I
[47:22] think you can also withdraw and that
[47:24] would be an issue I'm bit skeptic about
[47:26] this the kind circular economy thing if
[47:29] it's not just it's great if it's like
[47:30] reaching out to local population if it's
[47:33] a kind of withdrawal laring that I'm
[47:36] afraid of it's like oh no you don't want
[47:38] to like shut off the ways you contribute
[47:41] to the World by retreating to a kind of
[47:44] Village at the end of the world or if
[47:47] you're not into agriculture uh that's
[47:50] just much less value contribution and
[47:53] that shouldn't be the way Bitcoin
[47:55] empowers you to do unless it's it's your
[47:57] wealth I mean it's really the perfect
[47:59] setup that's fine and I also prefer
[48:01] actually more rural Landscapes uh but
[48:05] there is a tradeoff and and the most
[48:07] important thing is is your family how
[48:09] can you maintain your family of course
[48:10] how can you produce value for other
[48:12] people how can you be productive how can
[48:14] you flourish uh how can you help other
[48:17] people flourish all these things come
[48:18] first from a kind of seeking an ideal
[48:21] Refuge somewhere but refuges become more
[48:24] important it's just you only go through
[48:26] Refuge when there's really like the of
[48:29] the sirens are sounding and there's
[48:32] alarm and you are most of the time you
[48:35] have a refuge because you don't have to
[48:37] use it and that helps you to maintain
[48:39] your life and be happy about it because
[48:41] you know you have options if you need
[48:43] them yeah I think the freedom has a lot
[48:44] to do with options uh and and I love I
[48:47] love that answer a lot really cool um
[48:49] we're coming already to closer to the
[48:51] end of the podcast um I asked every one
[48:54] of my guests that one question what can
[48:56] we learn from you besides Bitcoin and I
[48:59] will add with few aan economics in that
[49:01] what can we learn from you besides all
[49:04] the things that we already talked about
[49:05] well I I think I mean what can we learn
[49:08] from
[49:09] experiences I had you mean or what yeah
[49:14] what whatever Direction you want to take
[49:16] it from uh from you that experience you
[49:19] had learnings that you had uh things
[49:21] that you want to share a different side
[49:24] that we don't know about well for me it
[49:26] was the first approach is what can I
[49:28] learn and that probably you can learn
[49:31] I've been in education for a long time
[49:33] I've been University Professor for a
[49:35] long time I'm an educational
[49:37] entrepreneur I run my own Institute
[49:39] where can you can study the Austin
[49:42] School in this traditional
[49:44] interdisciplinary form which I think no
[49:46] nowhere else uh it has not been alive uh
[49:50] in that sense uh so I think I'm the only
[49:53] one who can Bridge those Traditions uh
[49:55] and teach them but most importantly I
[49:58] think I'm able to do that and I was able
[50:00] to to learn about Bitcoin or understand
[50:03] Bitcoin uh even though I had this
[50:07] academic side as well because I'm
[50:09] curious and I always want to learn first
[50:12] and uh uh I'm interested in all kind of
[50:15] stuff I'm heavily involved with
[50:17] technology with investing
[50:19] entrepreneurship or practical sites that
[50:22] are crucial for exploring the world and
[50:24] if you are on the Practical side I think
[50:27] it means being more open to the the the
[50:30] Deep Le taking Leisure to understand
[50:33] things reflect them uh and be do that on
[50:36] top of a tradition where you stand on
[50:38] the shoulders of giants and you don't
[50:40] have to reinvent everything uh but I
[50:43] think
[50:44] fundamentally uh you are not a good
[50:47] teacher if you don't want to learn and
[50:50] that's also in education if you do it
[50:52] for your kids most people assume like
[50:54] education is something that you convey
[50:57] unidirectionally it's actually about
[50:59] learning if you want kids to learn
[51:01] something you must be the one learning
[51:03] and be an example in learning so that
[51:05] people say Okay learning is actually fun
[51:08] uh that's great uh and I think yeah
[51:11] that's maybe the main Insight I can give
[51:14] you I can only be a good teacher because
[51:16] I don't want to be a teacher I want to
[51:17] learn myself and I learn everything
[51:20] something new every day and even though
[51:22] I've been very early to
[51:24] bitcoin uh I have to learn something new
[51:28] every day uh and uh it's always seems
[51:32] too much it always seems that when I've
[51:36] learned something a thousand new
[51:38] questions open up I have to pursue um
[51:41] and that's an open ended process it's
[51:43] not the the we approach education kind
[51:45] of degree then you stop you done your
[51:48] degree already you learn everything and
[51:50] it's why of course most of it is useless
[51:52] it's entirely useless that's why most
[51:54] academic economists are useless or work
[51:56] and useless um and even Austrian
[51:59] economists if they're only in Academia
[52:02] tend to not even understand Bitcoin
[52:04] which I think is really
[52:06] painful if you're in that tradition and
[52:08] still haven't been curious enough and
[52:11] open enough to at least learn from
[52:13] people who have figured out how it
[52:15] helped them subjectively and and get
[52:17] that experience right and still look at
[52:19] it from the schematic theoretical way
[52:21] like oh that can't be because my theory
[52:23] doesn't allow
[52:25] it so let let me help you fix
[52:28] Bitcoin um an approach like that so yeah
[52:32] stay open stay curious uh keep on
[52:37] learning uh I I love that a lot that's I
[52:40] think that's my main motivation to to do
[52:43] the podcast because I do it daily I
[52:45] don't know if you you know but I do a
[52:46] daily Bitcoin podcast and uh it's not
[52:49] always Bitcoin that we talk about it's
[52:51] all this other topics and it's just I'm
[52:55] I'm I'm so amazed on just a learning
[52:57] curve on bitcoin and all the other
[52:59] things and so I think that's a really
[53:01] good approach to life just like keep
[53:02] learning and keep keep being curious and
[53:06] uh yes I agree with atin economics that
[53:08] don't understand Bitcoin it's
[53:09] frustrating sometimes uh when you talk
[53:12] with people that that think like oh yeah
[53:14] you're a bitcoiner but you don't know it
[53:16] yet really cool then let's come to the
[53:18] end routine of the the podcast where the
[53:20] previous guest is asking a question for
[53:22] the next guest without knowing who the
[53:23] next guest actually is uh and the
[53:26] previous guest asked a very interesting
[53:28] question that I wanted to actually ask
[53:30] before already uh but I kept it for the
[53:32] endro team do you think Bitcoin
[53:35] volatility will go up or down in the
[53:37] future and uh why should go down in the
[53:41] future and the reason is that anything
[53:44] that's new uh is a discovery process uh
[53:48] and then liquidity has to increase over
[53:50] time for anything that's an asset uh so
[53:53] it's a typical phenomenon what you
[53:55] expect uh volatility going down very
[53:58] much I agree with that a lot thank you
[54:00] so much Rahim for for being on my
[54:02] podcast before I let you go where can
[54:04] people find you read more about you and
[54:06] find out more about you you can find me

[54:12] scholium or website scarium perfect then

[54:17] the time also thank you so much for
