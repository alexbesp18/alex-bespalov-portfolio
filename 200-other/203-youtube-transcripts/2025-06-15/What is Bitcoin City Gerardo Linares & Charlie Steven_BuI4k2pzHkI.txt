[00:00] very substantial steps are being taken
[00:02] towards uh Bitcoin integration in the
[00:04] monetary system and I don't know if you
[00:06] understand Robin what I'm trying to say
[00:07] here it's like a sandb it's like an
[00:09] opportunity for people to apply all
[00:11] these theories that they have cuz
[00:13] bitcoiners have loads of theories they
[00:14] have loads of ideas of how the world is
[00:16] going to be in the future but this is a
[00:18] real use case this is when you actually
[00:20] get to ask the real questions and see
[00:21] what the real problems are how far would
[00:23] you say this local circular economy has
[00:26] come there's a place that can be called
[00:28] Bitcoin City Berlin is the
[00:31] Place quickly uh introduce yourself who
[00:34] are you and what are you doing in in
[00:36] Bitcoin berin and then let's go into
[00:38] what Bitcoin ber actually isard you want
[00:40] to start yes my name is hero Linares and
[00:44] I am from I'm Salvadorian living here in
[00:47] Berlin for the past seven eight
[00:49] months and ever since we move here we've
[00:53] been working towards the Bitcoin
[00:55] adoption here in this uh mountain town
[00:58] and you're the founder also of of bit
[01:00] bilon right yes uh my girlfriend and I
[01:04] we came with the idea of um start a
[01:07] circular economy and we came to Berlin
[01:10] and we started to on board businesses
[01:14] and when did you join uh Charlie yes uh
[01:17] couple of months later Charlie came
[01:19] sorry you yes yeah about seven months
[01:22] I've been here living in Berlin but
[01:25] Gerardo Nevin had started even before
[01:28] that before you even moved to the town
[01:30] you guys were uh coming back and forth
[01:33] from San Miguel for for at least a month
[01:36] if not more and then there was um there
[01:40] was one other um bitcoiner let's say in
[01:43] in Berlin apart from Gerardo and Evelyn
[01:46] and it was kind of just starting off but
[01:49] the the locals were were really
[01:52] enthusiastic about what was happening
[01:54] and I mean I think that was what
[01:56] attracted me to to Berlin uh I can give
[02:00] a small
[02:01] introduction you want yeah my name is
[02:04] Charlie I'm from I was born in Ireland
[02:07] and raised in Spain um I studied math
[02:10] and finance and worked as an act to S
[02:14] insurance companies and
[02:15] Auditors
[02:17] and uh been trying to understand about
[02:21] Bitcoin since
[02:22] 2017 and when working in the financial
[02:26] world as an analyst I decided that I
[02:28] want to put the the skills that I
[02:31] learned about economics and maths and
[02:34] finance and directed towards Bitcoin and
[02:36] being a local circular economy and I
[02:39] found Berlin was something that was uh
[02:41] starting to rise I felt there was some
[02:43] authenticity behind what was happening
[02:45] here and the job on Twitter was was
[02:49] really good to get that attention so um
[02:52] I decided when I was in London I'm going
[02:54] to go over and I'm going to live in in
[02:56] Berlin and since coming here it's just
[02:58] been a a massive of Journey it's it's
[03:01] constantly go go go every day is
[03:04] something new is happening and I feel
[03:06] like there's very substantial steps are
[03:09] being taken
[03:11] towards uh Bitcoin integration in the
[03:13] monetary system and and people's
[03:15] attitude towards money shifting as as
[03:18] the days go by which is just amazing to
[03:20] see that's interesting because you came
[03:22] from London from from that place where
[03:25] is this Western Place how different is
[03:28] it from uh if if someone from London or
[03:31] even Germany and this this kind of world
[03:33] lives in how different is it now in in
[03:36] Berlin that's sometimes I think it's
[03:38] confused with the Berlin in Germany uh
[03:41] how different is it now in in El
[03:43] Salvador in in
[03:44] Berlin different worlds completely
[03:47] different worlds London was was built on
[03:50] on the financial World it built up on on
[03:54] the the Arbitrage that they could make
[03:58] uh from Financial assets that's the way
[04:02] it was made so London is an expert and
[04:07] the the Fiat world or or on financial
[04:10] World whereas El Salvador seems to have
[04:13] suffered from from the the status quo
[04:16] over the last couple of centuries um so
[04:19] there's a different different levels of
[04:21] capitalization in both areas you have
[04:24] lot lot of more infrastructure built up
[04:27] in the west but the the direction of
[04:30] where Society is going in terms of its
[04:32] its moral Integrity in terms of uh the
[04:36] division between the population is much
[04:38] higher than in El Salvador where people
[04:40] are united here there's a very clear
[04:44] leader in the country people are behind
[04:46] that leader and there is a the the idea
[04:51] of sovereignty and Liberty is is is at
[04:54] the Forefront of the mind of people who
[04:56] definitely come to live here in El
[04:58] Salvador so that's not that's not
[05:02] principles that is at the Forefront of
[05:04] people living in London um so yeah
[05:07] you're you're around people who are
[05:08] thinking of the same principles around
[05:11] like-minded people and I think that's
[05:12] one of the Stark differences is that you
[05:14] feel like you're you're understood you
[05:16] feel like you you belong and you feel
[05:18] like you can actually make progress in
[05:21] your own life and you can feel like you
[05:24] feel more stable here you feel like
[05:26] you're going into the into the a black
[05:29] hole where in in Europe that was my
[05:32] perception of it and that's interesting
[05:34] because I researched a lot about uh
[05:37] Bitcoin El Salvador in before we started
[05:40] the episode and the the feeling I got
[05:43] was amazing like it's this hopeful
[05:46] motivated uh let's let's rebuild
[05:49] something uh really really great let's
[05:52] let's do something new it's like almost
[05:54] like a startup uh City uh kind of
[05:57] feeling that I got like I was never in
[05:59] Salvador and I'm really sorry for that
[06:02] because I have to go there I wanted to
[06:04] go there even last year and I think this
[06:06] November with adopting bitco I hopefully
[06:08] will be able to do it uh but this is the
[06:10] feeling I get when I speak with uh
[06:13] people from El Salvador on the podcast
[06:15] or when I speak with people that are
[06:17] moved to El Salvador I spoke yesterday
[06:19] with Lena sa like the the mother of the
[06:22] the little hler and she's also now kind
[06:25] of settling in El Salvador um and this
[06:29] the feeling I get from from the place
[06:33] here down in Lena in person oh yeah yeah
[06:38] yeah she she's there right since since
[06:40] the time and maybe for terado
[06:45] um how was it different when you came to
[06:48] uh Berlin and how big is the place and
[06:52] and how was now this introducing of
[06:55] Bitcoin and making B to bitcoin B
[06:58] possible like like how did this this all
[07:01] start and maybe how also the uh locals
[07:05] and uh the government and the the the
[07:09] mayor store there reacted to all that
[07:13] the um politician haven't been involved
[07:15] uh much in the whole
[07:18] project um when we started here we
[07:20] started going to visit U businesses
[07:23] they're small family business owners
[07:25] here and we started going to those
[07:29] business so they can start accepting
[07:31] Bitcoin um we knew El Salvador back then
[07:35] like seven eight months ago it hasn't
[07:37] changed that much when it comes to
[07:38] bitcoin adoption or you know Merchants
[07:40] accepting Bitcoin so we knew that once
[07:43] we had a certain amount of um businesses
[07:46] accepting Bitcoin this was going to call
[07:48] the attention and um that's what we did
[07:52] we just starting um you
[07:55] know calling people's attention there
[07:58] were berliners here here that uh we
[08:01] talked to them and they like the idea of
[08:03] becoming a city where there's a you know
[08:06] big adoption of Bitcoin because they
[08:09] knew that that was going to bring
[08:10] opportunities and it was going to be
[08:12] something different so I had help from
[08:16] uh many people from Berlin we some of
[08:19] them they were not interested in Bitcoin
[08:22] even though we talk about Bitcoin all
[08:24] the time uh you know it's a slow slow it
[08:27] was slowly growing on them it was not
[08:30] like right away so what we did to get
[08:33] them involved was like do some different
[08:35] cleaning campaigns or painting campaigns
[08:38] here in the city and that got them
[08:41] involved in the project so it wasn't not
[08:43] only about Bitcoin you know it was not
[08:45] only um about the Bitcoin adoption but
[08:48] you know coming here to um Berlin and
[08:51] trying to make something different yeah
[08:54] the beginning was was fun yes and what
[08:58] what was the CH like I imagine it was
[09:01] quite difficult to uh convince the
[09:04] merchants and Bitcoin to uh and the
[09:08] merchants and the people do Bitcoin like
[09:10] the people have uh the all over the
[09:13] world B people have the
[09:16] misunderstandings about Bitcoin being a
[09:18] scam being something that will fade away
[09:20] like how was the the challenges and the
[09:23] the beginning there yeah the beginning
[09:25] was the hardest because of that the only
[09:28] interaction that most people had with
[09:30] Bitcoin was with um The Cho wallet the
[09:34] government's uh
[09:36] wallet and um many people had problems
[09:39] with that wallet and many people got
[09:41] scammed because of that wallet and there
[09:44] was you know that was the only
[09:47] interaction that people have with
[09:48] Bitcoin so there were a lot of people um
[09:51] you know convinced that Bitcoin is a
[09:53] scam or it's not it's not
[09:56] safe um and yeah sometimes we have had
[09:59] to work through that and I we found now
[10:03] that the best way for us to you know try
[10:05] to convince people is just like try to
[10:08] convince them to download the app and
[10:09] make the first transaction and see them
[10:12] how that how smoothly that goes and let
[10:15] them know that um it will be that easy
[10:18] that it's not something to complicate
[10:20] their lives and that um all we need is
[10:23] just to take that first step now many
[10:25] many of that people that just started
[10:27] with making one transaction they are now
[10:29] going to a regular weekly meetings and
[10:31] they are learning more about Bitcoin
[10:33] they are holding Bitcoin now they want
[10:35] to learn more about how to save um
[10:38] properly so uh for us that's a a win the
[10:43] beginning was hard but but now is great
[10:46] that's really really cool um especially
[10:48] when like when you think about and and
[10:50] this is stuck out to me because the CH
[10:53] wallet came from the government like
[10:55] Bitcoin basically was a a government
[10:58] program kind of it it came from top down
[11:01] uh like it's bottom up basically Bitcoin
[11:04] but in the in the Bitcoin adoption from
[11:07] Nuka it came from them directly like
[11:11] adopt Bitcoin the president talks about
[11:13] Bitcoin positively and still people and
[11:16] citizens says oh it's a scam because I
[11:19] often see that here because the
[11:21] governments and the officials are saying
[11:23] oh it's nothing it's a scam stuff like
[11:25] that and so it comes from top down and
[11:28] people are all was just repeating oh
[11:30] it's a scam but it's interesting that in
[11:31] a country where the president like the
[11:34] highest kind of the highest person there
[11:36] if you think about that hierarchy um
[11:39] also in that country people pursue it as
[11:42] a like a scam it's interesting to see
[11:45] there needs to be something uh
[11:47] communicated here is that the level of
[11:49] trust in institutions is obviously much
[11:51] lower in Latin America considering the
[11:54] level of corruption in general from past
[11:56] decades I don't know if I'm right in
[11:58] saying that but you know there's that's
[12:00] that's right that's correct yes whereas
[12:03] whereas in Ireland for example as a as a
[12:06] comparison everyone generally does trust
[12:08] that the government has their best
[12:10] interest in heart and are generally
[12:11] happier about the level of corruption
[12:15] so the Bitcoin is kind of more poised
[12:18] for places with more distrust with
[12:20] institutions considering it's
[12:22] decentralized nature um so naib has has
[12:26] proposed the law in El salv a lot of
[12:29] people have automatically boxed Bitcoin
[12:31] in with with the president and
[12:34] immediately considered a political money
[12:38] just contrary to its founding right yeah
[12:44] and uh maybe for Bitcoin bin and what
[12:47] Gerardo start and what you Charlie also
[12:49] working on what specific projects are
[12:51] you working on like you're going from
[12:53] Merchant to Merchant trying to Orange
[12:55] build them uh you you also have local
[12:59] meetups where you educate people so like
[13:02] what what's what's going on there with
[13:03] the whole project uh yes so it started
[13:06] with um on boarding businesses but now
[13:08] is more than that we have our own Center
[13:12] like a headquarters where we have weekly
[13:16] meetups at least one class every Sunday
[13:20] I'm sorry every Monday um 6:30
[13:23] p.m. and locals comes so the classes are
[13:27] for locals everything is in Spanish they
[13:30] come and learn more about Bitcoin they
[13:32] come and learn to you know different
[13:35] ways to make bitcoin useful or how to um
[13:39] they can say Bitcoin use yesterday we
[13:41] had a local from Berlin uh young guy 18
[13:46] years old
[13:47] he um gave us a you know a talk about
[13:51] how Bitcoin beats the inflation on on US
[13:56] Dollars and it's really it was really
[13:58] interesting because he came you know a
[14:00] couple of times to the MonDay meetings
[14:01] and all of a sudden he says I would like
[14:03] to be on one on one of those Monday
[14:06] talks and I would like to give one and
[14:09] which is you know I'm pretty sure that
[14:11] for anyone involved in this project and
[14:14] that knows what the kind of work that we
[14:16] are doing that's a you know huge smile
[14:18] that comes to our faces when we hear
[14:20] something like that um but um but yes we
[14:24] do that we keep on boarding businesses
[14:27] we are giving Bitcoin education now and
[14:30] we do we keep we keep doing a social
[14:33] projects because we know that that's how
[14:35] some people will approach to our project
[14:38] um among some other different things
[14:40] we're giving English classes in the
[14:42] center and um Charlie is given a lot of
[14:46] um education here he knows a lot about
[14:49] economics so not only about Bitcoin but
[14:52] also about economics um you know uh and
[14:57] and yes Charlie can can tell you a
[14:59] little bit more about what else we're
[15:00] doing here there's a lot of things that
[15:02] we have in order to played I mean it's
[15:05] sometimes it feels like there's a lot on
[15:07] our plate and being able to manage these
[15:11] uh goals and projects is is probably the
[15:13] hardest part we've got a a certain
[15:16] number of people here you know there's
[15:18] there's a board of maybe six seven who
[15:22] who make the the plans and put the steps
[15:25] ahead and then there's a a bigger group
[15:28] with maybe 16 17 bitcoiners who've
[15:31] arrived here and and local bitcoiners
[15:33] who who who are very much involved in
[15:35] the project and then there's everybody
[15:37] else in the town so there's different
[15:39] layers of I suppose decision making H
[15:43] but you have to have a balance you have
[15:45] to have a balance of of being able to
[15:48] communicate what the mission is of of
[15:50] bit of the Bitcoin Center to the
[15:53] locals because the locals let's say most
[15:56] of the people that you talk to were born
[15:58] in Berlin the level of of people who are
[16:02] from not from Berlin arriving into the
[16:04] town is quite low so then all of a
[16:06] sudden then you have all of these
[16:08] tourists ding so people are obviously
[16:11] skeptical or at least questionable as to
[16:13] what what is happening so communicating
[16:15] that to the looses is one part which is
[16:19] what we do on the Mondays and and then
[16:21] through the classes like the economic
[16:23] classes through the to the financial
[16:25] education and through the English
[16:26] classes but then there's also the other
[16:29] part the other part is being able to
[16:32] communicate to the bitcoiners in the
[16:34] world internationally as to what is
[16:35] happening in the town so we have certain
[16:38] activities there's a a monthly Meetup
[16:41] that is that is being organized to then
[16:44] lead up to this mini conference in April
[16:48] April 8th which is its aim is basically
[16:52] to Showcase what does a Bitcoin circular
[16:55] economy look like and how does it affect
[16:58] the local
[16:59] how does it affect the economics of that
[17:02] town um how do we use the tools the
[17:06] Bitcoin Tools in order to reduce the
[17:08] friction of transaction these are all
[17:10] really really important questions that
[17:12] you have to ask um and and people talk
[17:15] about circular economies a lot like
[17:18] we're doing a circular economy people
[17:19] don't put enough thought into like what
[17:21] does this what are the consequences of
[17:24] Bitcoin circulating rather than dollars
[17:26] how does this affect people's mentality
[17:28] how does it affect people's savings how
[17:30] does it affect investment and I think
[17:32] this is these are questions that we are
[17:35] asking ourselves and iterating through
[17:38] in in real time do I don't know if you
[17:40] understand Robin what I'm trying to say
[17:42] here but it's it's it's like a Sandbox
[17:44] it's like an opportunity for people to
[17:46] apply all these theories that they have
[17:48] because bitcoiners have loads of
[17:50] theories they have loads of ideas of how
[17:52] the world is going to be in the future
[17:54] but this is a real use case this is when
[17:56] you actually get to ask the real
[17:57] questions and see what what the real
[17:58] problems are when using Bitcoin so the
[18:01] conference is coming up we've got the
[18:03] classes happening H we've also got a
[18:07] podcast room being set up here I'm
[18:08] sitting in it right now and it's just uh
[18:11] it's just forming and then we have real
[18:13] estate so bitcoiners who want to arrive
[18:16] or locals who want to rent out their
[18:18] their houses they can do it through the
[18:20] center and then we also I don't know if
[18:22] you've mentioned this kardo but we have
[18:24] the
[18:25] IT training happening here which is I
[18:28] think it's it's just an amazing project
[18:30] so a link is is occurring between the
[18:34] Bitcoin Center in Berlin and a local
[18:36] University in San Miguel to give some
[18:38] sort of authority to the classes giving
[18:42] here at the center and we've fortunately
[18:45] been
[18:46] donated over 12 computers to to the
[18:50] center we have a designed area just to
[18:53] give typing classes uh Microsoft product
[18:57] classes Excel word all the basic
[19:00] ingredients for someone to be useful in
[19:02] a in a remote job and what that allows
[19:05] for us to do and for the locals to do is
[19:08] get trained up trained up on on how to
[19:11] be useful in a call center um at any
[19:15] remote job and allow for Bitcoin to come
[19:18] into the town from abroad injecting
[19:21] Bitcoin local economy I'm super excited
[19:24] to announce that this podcast just got
[19:27] the first ever sponsor I just started
[19:31] the podcast out like three months ago
[19:33] and now we have 21 Bitcoin as a partner
[19:37] for this podcast 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[19:41] only from day one and they teach and
[19:44] preach self custody this is my goto
[19:48] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[19:51] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[19:53] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[19:57] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[20:00] support this podcast use code Robin and
[20:04] click the link in the description how
[20:06] far would you say this local circular
[20:09] economy economy has come like how many
[20:13] Merchants are there that actually accept
[20:15] Bitcoin how many people like from the
[20:18] local bitco local uh binas the local El
[20:22] salvadorians in the town like how many
[20:25] are there there actually like bitcoiners
[20:27] on getting involved and how they are
[20:29] seeing the the whole thing um what what
[20:32] percentage of like uh progress would you
[20:35] would you give it to like a full flashed
[20:37] Bitcoin City because I imagine it's not
[20:40] quite there yet but it's on the
[20:43] way well um if there's a place that can
[20:47] be called Bitcoin City Berlin is the
[20:49] place I mean if we're talking about a
[20:51] place with adoption uh I think Berlin is
[20:54] the place where more Bitcoin uh it's you
[20:57] know where more where you can live with
[20:59] Bitcoin
[21:01] um we are about well maybe over 100 now
[21:06] over 100 Merchants that accept
[21:08] Bitcoin uh here in Berlin you can pretty
[21:11] much go and just pay with my with your
[21:13] phone you know Bitcoin everywhere you
[21:15] can pay the small things like you know
[21:17] bread milk uh and um your eggs your
[21:22] coffee and uh you can eat Bas you can
[21:26] eat steaks you can go and pay your
[21:29] gasoline with
[21:30] Bitcoin um you can Car Wash you know you
[21:34] can wash your car you can go to the car
[21:35] wash and pay with Bitcoin I mean there's
[21:38] a you can pretty much go here in Berlin
[21:41] without using Fiat or using US Dollars
[21:44] um then the we are not that worried now
[21:48] to keep on boarding business I mean
[21:50] that's important part we keep doing it
[21:52] and every week there's more and more
[21:53] businesses being added but what we want
[21:56] to do is like teach those that are
[21:58] already set Bitcoin um you know the uh
[22:02] philosophy of Bitcoin so they understand
[22:05] what Bitcoin really is um um some of
[22:09] them they use Bitcoin just as a tool a
[22:12] payment tool you know and uh we really
[22:16] want to get to those businesses because
[22:17] there's a lot of them that started like
[22:19] that that use use accepting Bitcoin as a
[22:21] you know another form of payment uh but
[22:25] now they are a bitcoiners you know they
[22:27] want to learn more they are holding
[22:29] Bitcoin and they are there on Monday
[22:31] meetings and we want most of the you
[22:35] know business in Bitcoin and you know
[22:37] regular citizens to approach us um to
[22:40] the center and learn more about that um
[22:44] really cool maybe Charlie before I think
[22:46] you have to go in a few minutes now
[22:50] uh in as as you are moved from London to
[22:55] uh El Salvador to Berlin uh do you
[22:59] recommend that to like people that are
[23:01] living in the in the vest to do that and
[23:04] and why are you recommending and if you
[23:05] recommended it why are you recommending
[23:07] it to to to live in uh El Salvador
[23:11] making like the the Bitcoin a circle
[23:13] economy work on that as a bitcoiner that
[23:16] watches like the show in I don't know
[23:18] London America Germany okay well I think
[23:21] first of all we need to set the scene
[23:23] for for what's happening in the world
[23:25] and what's about to come uh
[23:28] you need to like it depends on your
[23:31] world view I think that's super
[23:33] important if if you think that the world
[23:37] is is going to come more stable over the
[23:39] next couple of decades then you're okay
[23:41] you can stay where you are but if you
[23:43] can increasingly see that there is
[23:46] there's no way but for chaos to ensue in
[23:50] certain areas with regards to to
[23:53] financial
[23:54] inflation and and towards Division and
[23:58] clashing there's a lot of IUS in the
[24:00] world let's just say a lot of that
[24:01] that's just death so a lot of people
[24:03] have claims on the scarce resources that
[24:05] exist and being able to figure out who
[24:08] owns was is is the hardest thing and it
[24:12] happens every hundred years or so where
[24:14] there's a debt restructuring so that's
[24:16] where people decide who ow who actually
[24:18] is going to pay back and who owns
[24:19] whatever so this scene this scene is
[24:22] we're coming into it and just imagine
[24:24] this this this massive clash of
[24:28] right who owns what here in El Salvador
[24:32] there's a clear clear uh assignation as
[24:37] to who owns what their property rights
[24:39] are very much clear here and that's
[24:42] thanks to bitcoin and it's thanks to the
[24:44] the the governance in this in this
[24:46] country so if you are liberty-minded if
[24:49] you believe in private property if you
[24:51] believe in in capitalism and if you
[24:54] believe that entrepreneurs are good for
[24:56] the world then I actually fully
[24:58] recommend you to come over here if you
[24:59] believe in bitcoin's vision of the
[25:01] future and if you think of what what
[25:04] naive is doing in terms of reducing
[25:06] crime and allowing for uh families and
[25:09] for individuals to thrive and do
[25:11] whatever they believe is good for the
[25:13] world then I I recommend for you to come
[25:16] over if you are used to being able to
[25:19] receive paycheck without um adding value
[25:23] if you are used to um working in
[25:27] bureaucratic job where you're making a
[25:30] lot of money uh it it might be a tough
[25:33] transition and it might not be the best
[25:36] place for you so it depends on on on
[25:39] what your world view is I believe
[25:41] capitalistic liian orientated then El
[25:45] Salvador is a fantastic place to come
[25:47] and up try and try and upgrade the world
[25:50] I suppose I think that's the general
[25:51] mental attitude and I think what you're
[25:53] doing Robin with this is is part of that
[25:55] so yeah come check it out see if it's if
[25:58] it's your cup of tea I certainly believe
[26:01] that this is a place for me over the
[26:03] next few years uh so maybe someone else
[26:06] also has the same feeling when coming
[26:10] interesting how easy is it to
[26:12] translation D Salvador from like a
[26:15] country from let's say London let's say
[26:18] Germany let's say America like how easy
[26:20] is it to just go there uh do you have to
[26:23] bring something for Capital how e it
[26:26] does you get get the visa like Salvador
[26:29] how is the switch going I mean it's a
[26:30] different for every individual it
[26:32] depends on your standard of living
[26:33] before coming here there's varying
[26:35] standards of living within the Western
[26:37] World you know you could you can be
[26:39] someone with a you know with a very
[26:42] decent job or a business in in the
[26:44] western world if you can sell that and
[26:46] come over with a cushion highly
[26:47] recommend that because there's going to
[26:49] be a period of understanding people's
[26:51] needs in this country for you to be able
[26:54] to sustain yourself you need to either
[26:56] work in a job here or start a business
[26:59] and to start a business you need to know
[27:00] what people need so I recommend for
[27:04] people to have a bit of a CAU uh and to
[27:07] have it in Bitcoin not in in other
[27:09] currencies when coming over and I
[27:11] recommend for you to reach out to people
[27:13] who are here and find projects that
[27:16] appeal to you within El Salvador and
[27:19] reach out to the individuals who are
[27:20] involved with that so that you get an
[27:23] idea of the
[27:24] landscape there's varying degrees of
[27:28] standards of living even in El Salvador
[27:30] so you can go to elante and you can pay
[27:33] $2,000 a month for an apartment if you
[27:36] want and you can live a much better life
[27:40] than in any Western Country if you so if
[27:43] you so much appeal but you also can come
[27:45] to places small towns and you can live
[27:48] on $150 a month rent and have a house if
[27:52] you really want to um so it depends on
[27:56] on what what you prioritize in terms of
[27:58] your Comforts how much you're willing to
[28:01] to take like in Berlin water flows
[28:05] through once every two days even though
[28:06] you always have water because you have
[28:08] systems in place H there's there's
[28:12] different levels of infrastructure that
[28:14] you might have to get used to
[28:17] so I mean if you're more Rough and Ready
[28:20] if you've been traveling and you can you
[28:22] can do it then so be if you're coming
[28:24] from a job that's you know you have
[28:26] everything in place then I recommend for
[28:28] you to have more Capital if you don't
[28:31] understand Spanish I recommend for you
[28:32] to have more Capital because you're
[28:33] going to spend more to be able to deal
[28:36] with things but is just it's just the
[28:38] way it goes so depend it's a case by
[28:41] case situation but always good to have a
[28:43] c I think it's a it's I think more and
[28:46] more people are thinking of moving to El
[28:49] Salvador also like had some guests on
[28:52] who are actually like oh I think I want
[28:54] to move there I'm not sure uh right now
[28:58] some even have plans they're like okay
[29:00] in two years when figured out with the
[29:01] kids and everything then we're moving uh
[29:04] so I think more more bitcoiners have it
[29:06] on their mind to move like the Bitcoin
[29:08] City to like to El Salvador uh
[29:11] especially those that are really
[29:12] involved in the community because you
[29:14] can actually see the Bitcoin progress I
[29:17] mean there are other places where also
[29:19] like kind of an adoption is going on for
[29:21] example in Lugano uh in in Switzerland
[29:24] but I I think it's quite different from
[29:27] from like El Salvador um maybe to like
[29:31] because Charlie does not have yeah go
[29:33] ahead no one more question I'll I can
[29:37] answer it and then okay perfect then uh
[29:39] let's uh have the the end routine of the
[29:42] the podcast is uh that the previous
[29:45] guest asks a question from for for the
[29:47] next guest uh and the guest the question
[29:50] is actually coming from Lena saki from
[29:52] the previous guest uh as we talked about
[29:56] her earlier
[29:57] uh and maybe the the question for the
[30:00] both of you um what is the best argument
[30:03] till now that you found to convince
[30:06] someone of
[30:08] Bitcoin you go first sorry what's the
[30:11] best argument can you repeat the
[30:13] question again yeah the question from
[30:15] the previous guest was like what is the
[30:17] best argument to convince someone uh of
[30:21] Bitcoin we seen that many people they
[30:25] they had never asked themselves the
[30:26] question where money comes from and they
[30:28] don't get why is it that we use printed
[30:31] money um if you put that in perspective
[30:33] to people I it's kind of cruel actually
[30:35] but if you put that in perspective when
[30:37] you talk to people and you let them know
[30:39] that they are working 10 12 14 hours a
[30:42] day for printed money they soon come to
[30:45] the realization and and you know the um
[30:49] next step is they go like what's the
[30:50] alternative and you know we know the
[30:52] alternative is St point so probably that
[30:55] once you understand that the feed man is
[30:57] is rocked it's it's easier to adopt the
[31:01] sound money system yeah go ahead
[31:03] Charlie like I think another one
[31:08] is uh if you want to if you want to
[31:10] build a table you need to get a a
[31:14] measuring stick to figure out like the
[31:16] measurements of building that table same
[31:19] thing with the with civilization you
[31:21] need to understand the value of things
[31:22] to be able to coordinate your actions as
[31:25] human so we know how much things are so
[31:27] I know how much to invest or how much
[31:30] money I'm going to make you know these
[31:32] are all the the principles of making
[31:35] economic calculation so we have the
[31:37] measuring stick the meter stick for the
[31:39] table what's our measuring stick for for
[31:42] the value of
[31:43] things uh our measuring stick is dollars
[31:47] what if people keep changing the actual
[31:49] meter stick if people kept changing the
[31:52] amount of centimeters in a meter stick
[31:54] every day how the hell is anybody and it
[31:57] it's different in different countries
[31:58] how are people supposed to actually
[32:01] construct a a railway that that goes
[32:04] across countries how can you how can you
[32:06] build H Bitcoin is our measuring stick
[32:09] just like one meter has a limit of one
[32:11] meter Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million
[32:13] and through that measuring stick of
[32:16] Bitcoin we can value all of the things
[32:18] around us so I think that's that's one
[32:21] that that allows us to understand how
[32:23] how we how we coordinate in between
[32:26] countries how how do we coordinate
[32:27] between communities and individuals and
[32:30] how we can build a society that actually
[32:32] is a find peace so that that's that's
[32:35] the aim I mean it might not be for total
[32:38] begin beginners but I definitely think
[32:40] that it opens a opens up a a channel
[32:45] yeah and also it gives the perspective
[32:48] to what what Bitcoin is and then maybe
[32:50] like even a a noric and like oh right
[32:53] the the the stick should not change like
[32:55] meter should always be a meter and when
[32:58] we increase the value of the Euro and
[33:00] have inflation then the meter is
[33:04] changing every year and it's a it's a
[33:06] crazy uh Point uh to to end the podcast
[33:09] and I think we got a an interesting
[33:12] overview short overview of the biton bin
[33:15] project and maybe we can do like in one
[33:16] two three years like an a progression uh
[33:20] second round of of that podcast and see
[33:23] how how how further we are going with
[33:26] the Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador
[33:28] maybe there are other countries that are
[33:29] in a similar stage than El Salvador
[33:31] right now is that will be interesting to
[33:34] see and thank you Charlie thank you J
[33:37] for for your time and uh uh is there
[33:41] anything more you want to add anything

[33:47] they want to well yes the invitation is
[33:50] always if to any people that lives

[33:59] come and see for themselves that don't
[34:01] trust what we say that so they can come
[34:03] and verify how Bitcoin adoption looks
[34:06] like
[34:07] here and well yeah that will be my
[34:10] message yeah I I definitely think that
[34:13] we need a you know there's a lot of work
[34:16] to be done people are looking you know
[34:19] there's a lot of work to be done we need
[34:21] people on the ground if you have any
[34:23] sort of skills that you think can be
[34:25] contributed from there's volunteer
[34:27] positions here for you to learn what
[34:29] it's like to live in a circular economy
[34:31] and you can get involved with the
[34:32] project you can get to know the people
[34:34] here you can get to understand what are
[34:36] the problems and then try and apply that
[34:38] in other towns so there's a huge
[34:40] learning experience here it's a real
[34:43] Bitcoin standard in Berlin uh so do come
[34:47] check it out and and see if your skills
[34:50] come to use thank you for for taking the
[34:52] time yeah thanks
[34:54] Robin that was huge thank you
