[00:00] I just moved nearly all my portfolio
[00:01] into Bitcoin and was able to make enough
[00:03] to leave that job behind so you actually
[00:06] retired on bitcoin I thought that if I
[00:09] left early enough cuz I was still in my
[00:10] 30s that I wasn't institutionalized but
[00:12] I was like I actually had to take a lot
[00:14] of time to just reflect on the fact that
[00:16] my career was done I'm going to
[00:17] contribute as much as I can to my life
[00:20] right now in the hopes that my
[00:21] children's life will be better rather
[00:22] than just thinking I'm just waiting for
[00:24] retirement and then I'm going to do what
[00:25] I want people have an emotional
[00:27] connection to their Bitcoin no matter
[00:29] how much or how little it's just it's
[00:30] like their baby it's like a child don't
[00:32] speak ill of my Bitcoin it upsets me sir
[00:34] you require an ego death to be a
[00:36] bitcoiner because a lot of people are
[00:37] going to doubt you a lot of people are
[00:38] going to challenge you you know a lot of
[00:40] people are going to ignore you but you
[00:41] still have to be Resolute as you say in
[00:43] your ideas your ideology of how it can
[00:45] Empower others to be better is the
[00:47] ultimate Act of altruism to die with
[00:49] your private Keys Bitcoin is the only
[00:51] thing that you can take with you to the
[00:53] Crave but at the same time with taking
[00:56] it with you you're actually contributing
[00:59] it out to everyone met people in you
[01:01] know Central America they collect their
[01:03] income in Bitcoin they pay their
[01:04] expenses in Bitcoin there's no trusted
[01:06] intermediary between them and they live
[01:08] good lives they live good lives
[01:09] unbeknownst to most people in the
[01:11] traditional world I don't want Bitcoin
[01:12] to go to 1 million next year because
[01:15] that would mean the feat system is
[01:17] seriously in stress that itself from a
[01:21] theoretical standpoint would be great
[01:23] but from a practical standpoint this
[01:26] means your family will suffer your
[01:28] neighbors will suffer people that you
[01:30] love that don't have Bitcoin will
[01:32] [Music]
[01:36] suffer how did you retire early and and
[01:40] maybe this after that how how you got in
[01:42] Bitcoin maybe that's
[01:44] interesting sure so my my family um
[01:48] they're immigrants they're Indian but
[01:49] they lived in East Africa and came in uh
[01:51] to Canada in the 70s uh to you know
[01:55] start a better life and I was born here
[01:58] and the idea is that first first thing
[02:00] to do is get the best education that you
[02:02] can you know secure a very good job and
[02:05] typically a professional designation so
[02:07] that you can you know always have
[02:09] employment always have stability and not
[02:11] be dependent upon maybe uh an employer
[02:14] at the end of the day should you should
[02:16] you need to move in your career so my my
[02:18] dad was an accountant and my grandfather
[02:19] was an accountant so I chose accounting
[02:22] even though my inspiration was computers
[02:24] and computer science and programming
[02:26] because when I was going through high
[02:28] school that's when the internet was uh
[02:30] was was starting to grow and become big
[02:33] so my trajectory was just the
[02:35] predictable trajectory like the
[02:36] Immigrant success story that you come
[02:38] here and your children have a better
[02:39] life and they're able to provide for
[02:41] themselves um and that's what I did for
[02:43] many years and in
[02:46] 2020 um I made partner at one of the
[02:48] biggest accounting firms in Canada you
[02:50] know but it was also a time in which you
[02:52] know the pandemic hit us so I found
[02:54] myself at a bit of an inflection point
[02:56] whereby what I thought the job would be
[02:59] all of a sudden changed like technology
[03:01] like this this video conferencing
[03:03] although it did exist no one really used
[03:05] it you know it's like my dad used to
[03:07] wear a suit and tie to go to work and so
[03:09] I wore a collared shirt a suit when I
[03:11] needed to and shook hands with the
[03:12] clients but all of a sudden it was more
[03:13] of a it was more of like an etherical
[03:16] thing it was more of like a virtual
[03:18] thing where we interact with each other
[03:19] and I just thought back to like what I
[03:21] was really good at before I went into
[03:22] accounting which was computers and I
[03:24] thought I can't ever see us going back
[03:27] to normal I was thinking before the
[03:29] podcast it in 1938 Orson Wells did like
[03:32] a war of the world's broadcast where he
[03:34] said aliens had invaded and people
[03:36] believed it all of a sudden they just
[03:37] believed in this reality and I look back
[03:40] in hindsight to the pandemic and people
[03:42] just believed they should be scared they
[03:44] believed and I don't know if that was
[03:45] valid or not at the time it's easy like
[03:47] I said in hindsight but I just knew that
[03:49] things would not be the same anymore
[03:51] because of my study of computers so I uh
[03:54] watched my stock portfolio go down which
[03:56] I ALS also followed like logical means
[03:58] like accounting you invest in index F
[03:59] and dividend stocks and big Tech you
[04:01] think you know 20 30 years from now I'm
[04:03] going to be okay you know but then all
[04:05] those stocks tanked you know and certain
[04:07] things Rose like all the new age uh
[04:10] companies the SAS companies um the
[04:13] digital assets and I thought this would
[04:15] be a good opportunity if I can I can
[04:17] have like a sick sense of where the
[04:19] technolog is going to put my money where
[04:20] my mouth is so I just moved nearly all
[04:22] of my portfolio into Bitcoin and was
[04:24] able to make enough in that year to
[04:26] leave that job behind but then as we
[04:29] talked talked about before I when I left
[04:31] I kind of felt a little aimless I took a
[04:33] year off you know thinking about what to
[04:35] do met up with a lot of
[04:37] bitcoiners um and then I didn't think I
[04:39] would go back to accounting and in fact
[04:41] I almost resigned from my Institute uh
[04:43] here in Canada and um they said no don't
[04:46] don't give that up you never know how
[04:48] you can you can add value to the world
[04:50] and it just so happened that uh an
[04:52] ex-classmate approached me and said do
[04:53] you want to start an accounting firm
[04:55] with me like a different type of
[04:57] accounting firm an accounting firm that
[04:58] leverages technology leverages all the
[05:00] things that you know and I looked at
[05:01] that and I thought okay it's like okay I
[05:04] can still have the predictable path that
[05:05] I once had but I can have more abstract
[05:07] thinking to apply the changes that the
[05:10] world faced in order to empower myself
[05:13] to help clients in a new and Innovative
[05:15] way that's super interesting so you
[05:18] actually retired on bitcoin uh then you
[05:21] made like a year uh where you didn't uh
[05:25] nothing and then you came back to do
[05:27] that what did retiring and this like or
[05:31] like this Freedom that you got from that
[05:34] uh made with your perception of time and
[05:38] and maybe that how influenced how you
[05:40] think about Bitcoin and how you think
[05:41] about what you should do in the future
[05:43] with your time there's a scene in the
[05:46] Sha Shank Redemption when red uh he
[05:49] finally gets out of prison and he goes
[05:50] to a grocery store and every time he has
[05:52] to go to the bathroom he goes and asks
[05:54] his boss and the boss says to him you
[05:56] know you don't need to ask me every time
[05:57] you have to go just go but he's been was
[06:00] institutionalized because he had been in
[06:01] the system for so long so I thought that
[06:04] if I left early enough because I was
[06:05] still in my 30s um that I wasn't
[06:07] institutionalized but I was like I
[06:09] actually had to take a lot of time to
[06:11] just reflect on the fact that my career
[06:13] was done and it wasn't it wasn't so easy
[06:16] you know it it's like because everyone
[06:17] else was still working like everyone
[06:19] else was moving up in their career and
[06:21] so a lot of that time was just just
[06:23] wondering trying to make sense of like
[06:25] who I was as a person you know because
[06:27] if my identity is no longer my
[06:29] profession if my identity is no longer
[06:31] accounting who am I really and I
[06:33] wouldn't normally have asked myself that
[06:34] question until I was maybe 60 years old
[06:37] and so when I I I started to ask those
[06:39] questions of myself I realized I'm not
[06:41] ready to go all the way down this rabbit
[06:43] hole it's like I think that I can have
[06:45] another career I think that I can come
[06:47] back and do something different and so I
[06:50] more looked at it as like a one-year
[06:52] pivot into something different and then
[06:54] that's what took me down the
[06:55] entrepreneurial Journey so I I paused
[06:57] after the year and then I returned
[07:00] I love that a lot I think that that's
[07:02] that that's what a lot of people Miss
[07:04] like they they stay in this Lane they
[07:05] stay in this thing they are already in
[07:08] and they're too afraid to Pivot even a
[07:10] little bit like not even talking about
[07:14] like uh taking one or two years off
[07:16] completely and thinking of who you are
[07:18] and and thinking about where you want to
[07:20] go but just like thinking about staying
[07:22] in the job and thinking of like do you
[07:24] really want to do that like maybe
[07:26] there's like some small changes you you
[07:27] can do has I don't know what where the
[07:30] connection is with Bitcoin probably with
[07:31] the time aspect uh but do you see that
[07:34] that changing uh the uh when we all have
[07:37] Bitcoin like if Bitcoin actually becomes
[07:39] the standard do you think that uh
[07:41] motivates or encourages more people to
[07:44] actually think about their time more
[07:46] carefully yeah I certainly like to me
[07:50] wealth and success was more of a
[07:51] theoretical concept but it's when you're
[07:55] faced with it like if you could do
[07:57] anything what would you really do you
[07:59] assume that you know if you win the
[08:01] lottery you're going to go buy a new car
[08:02] you're going to buy a house you know
[08:03] you're going to go traveling but those
[08:05] things get boring really quickly it's
[08:07] like the deeper question of who you are
[08:09] when you have you don't have to work for
[08:11] your living you don't have to live a
[08:13] traditional life I'm not the only person
[08:15] who's done this like I was a newer
[08:16] bitcoiner in that regard like I've met
[08:18] so many now who fa the same question
[08:20] that I did maybe years ago and so they
[08:23] start to read the classic novels they
[08:25] start to think about economics and the
[08:27] way the world is structured they start
[08:28] to think about
[08:30] I just think that their time preference
[08:31] changes whereas they think that tomorrow
[08:34] is the time when they're going to deal
[08:35] with things they put them off they start
[08:37] to deal with them today because they
[08:38] want to have a better tomorrow um that's
[08:41] one thing I've really found so the
[08:42] long-term thinking like the Citadel
[08:44] thinking like I'm going to contribute as
[08:47] much as I can to my life right now in
[08:49] the hopes that my children's life will
[08:50] be better rather than just thinking I'm
[08:52] just waiting for retirement and then I'm
[08:54] going to do what I want they take the
[08:55] responsibility earlier so I think it's
[08:58] definitely a challenge to to do that but
[09:00] I think that if the world goes in that
[09:02] direction we have better long-term
[09:03] thinking we move away from fouryear
[09:05] political Cycles we move away from like
[09:07] Fiat money we move away from inflation
[09:09] and we move closer to long-term
[09:11] Traditional Values that have stood the
[09:12] test of time I often wonder if
[09:16] this uh actually happens with Bitcoin or
[09:20] if we think this happens with Bitcoin
[09:22] because in the Bitcoin Community it is
[09:24] right now like that but in the Bitcoin
[09:27] Community right now there are early
[09:28] adopters in there like different fers
[09:30] critical fers like we a very small
[09:32] bubble that is not only getting Bitcoin
[09:35] but they also brave enough to actually
[09:38] adopt this uh technology uh for the
[09:41] future like right now even if you come
[09:44] in but especially the people that came
[09:46] in like four years ago eight years ago
[09:48] or maybe 10 years ago um so so how much
[09:51] of of that Bitcoin Community is like
[09:54] because we are early adopters uh is like
[09:57] this fix the money fix the world like
[10:00] how deep does that actually go or will
[10:02] there or or or do we think it will
[10:06] change a lot just because we see the
[10:07] Bitcoin Community right now I think the
[10:09] Bitcoin Community is in a bit of an echo
[10:11] chamber I agree it's just like and we
[10:13] think that like because we are doing
[10:15] things a different way it's like that's
[10:17] the only way but that's what the other
[10:18] side thought too so it's almost like
[10:21] it's such an early perspective that we
[10:23] share and it's been such a short time
[10:25] period really s it's the sweet 16 who
[10:27] Bitcoin yesterday you know since the
[10:29] white paper came out but you can't
[10:31] project uh hundreds of years into the
[10:34] future if if if thousands of years in
[10:36] the past there was no Bitcoin you know
[10:38] it's just like are we going to end up in
[10:40] the same place that those who backed the
[10:42] Fiat system did I just don't know but I
[10:44] feel like because of the wealth aspect
[10:46] because of being an early adopter you're
[10:49] able to ask great questions but I look
[10:52] back to like the early adopters of
[10:54] social media for instance and we look at
[10:56] how it was once so free and open and
[10:58] then it was faced with sens ship and
[11:00] government control and now it's back to
[11:01] being open in some elements but it was
[11:04] difficult to predict it because unlike
[11:06] to me the Fiat currencies Bitcoin is an
[11:08] exponential technology social media and
[11:10] the internet are exponential technology
[11:12] so whatever assumptions you make today I
[11:15] think it's hazardous to assume that you
[11:17] will be able to understand the impact 50
[11:19] or 100 years from now of something like
[11:22] this because we might just be you know
[11:24] nodes in the Bitcoin Network this might
[11:26] just be the only awareness we're capable
[11:28] of after 16 years I haven't met anyone
[11:31] who really understands what Bitcoin is
[11:32] and maybe no one ever will but it's like
[11:34] to the best of your ability you play the
[11:36] role you're meant to play now just
[11:38] knowing that longer term it may be out
[11:39] of your control what happens a lot it's
[11:42] it's it ties back to that uh question of
[11:44] like what impact Bitcoin uh will truly
[11:47] have on this world and will truly have
[11:50] on on families I think it will have a
[11:52] Major Impact because so many things that
[11:55] is kind of is like a chain reaction like
[11:58] this this blowing fear system exploring
[12:00] centralization of everything like
[12:02] everyone has to go to a centralized uh
[12:04] University and that's the only way
[12:07] someone can require a skill uh it kind
[12:10] of blows up everything and then because
[12:12] everyone has to go to university they're
[12:13] coming out with like 30 35 and then they
[12:16] have the first job so these delays like
[12:18] having family having kids so there's so
[12:21] many aspects of that that come kind of
[12:24] all in together and it's fascinating for
[12:26] me and I really look forward to like
[12:28] talk remaining on my pod the next 10
[12:30] years uh and see the assumptions that we
[12:33] make now and and maybe how it turns out
[12:35] in 10 years but what do you think is
[12:37] like the biggest uh uh unexpected impact
[12:41] that that Bitcoin might have on on on on
[12:43] us personally I think that Bitcoin
[12:45] forces you as I said to face hard truths
[12:49] about yourself and about life earlier
[12:51] than
[12:52] expected um I used to work with a lot of
[12:55] wealthy families who had generational
[12:57] wealth who' built it up over maybe 50 75
[13:00] years or longer and so you know there
[13:02] was kind of a defined path that we took
[13:05] um where you build a business you know
[13:07] the the the whoever the the owner or the
[13:10] the the founder of the business might
[13:12] retire and then the children um inherit
[13:14] that business and then maybe their
[13:15] children do it with Bitcoin the time
[13:17] frame is compressed and so I wonder what
[13:20] happens now when such great amounts of
[13:24] wealth have been amassed by such a small
[13:26] amount of people they have so much power
[13:30] that even if you have the best of
[13:32] intentions it's like how can you know
[13:35] that the choices you make to invest that
[13:38] wealth that power in different
[13:39] structures will be a better system than
[13:42] the one that you currently live in you
[13:44] know like I said it's easy to assume
[13:46] that because things worked out in the
[13:47] past and we live in a good world now
[13:49] that like you'll have some contributory
[13:51] effect into the future but I just don't
[13:54] know like the long-term effect of this
[13:57] type of Technology like I look recently
[13:59] in micro strategy Michael sailor compan
[14:01] is investing 42 billion over the next
[14:03] three years into aggressive Bitcoin
[14:06] treasury expansion and being the example
[14:08] for the industry but there's a whole
[14:09] other element of bitcoiners who disagree
[14:11] with the way that he's cussing his coins
[14:13] like is he correct is he incorrect is
[14:15] there another option and there's this
[14:17] sort of tribalism in there where I think
[14:20] I don't know if there is any one right
[14:21] answer I just know that this technology
[14:24] hit us really fast and maybe there'll be
[14:26] a new technology that comes as a
[14:28] consequence of it
[14:29] but um you just have to do the best with
[14:31] the information that you have now but
[14:33] Bitcoin has changed even in the four
[14:34] years that I've been in it the four
[14:36] years it's gone from something
[14:37] controversial to something more more
[14:39] mainstream it's like what happens in
[14:41] four more years I don't know four years
[14:42] in Bitcoin feels like 20 years in the
[14:44] normal World also like the speed of the
[14:46] evolution so I just don't know how to
[14:49] how to frame that based on my
[14:50] understanding of the past like you said
[14:52] a more centralized traditional approach
[14:54] in in an exponential technology uh like
[14:56] world that Bitcoin is in yeah I think
[14:59] the perfect example is uh Donald Trump's
[15:01] tweet like 2019 about Bitcoin I saw it
[15:04] today on on on Twitter and then the
[15:07] tweets that he does now about Bitcoin
[15:09] it's like oh yeah like he had like a
[15:12] development of like he has to adopt
[15:14] Bitcoin he has to be for Bitcoin now and
[15:17] he's kind of the representation of like
[15:19] mainstream actually turning on bitcoin
[15:22] and turning pro Bitcoin that that's
[15:24] fascinating for me to watch yeah it is
[15:26] yeah Bitcoin is it seems like it's a it
[15:28] should be a n partisan issue but it's
[15:30] also tainted by different coins you know
[15:32] like the proof of work that is Bitcoin
[15:34] versus the proof of stake so there is a
[15:35] lot of confusion you can see why someone
[15:37] like him who's so busy with other things
[15:38] can be confused by it but there is a
[15:41] Clarity he seems to have found even if
[15:43] he's still you know giving with one hand
[15:45] for Bitcoin and then pump pimping his
[15:46] own coin on the other at least he
[15:48] understands it's a relevant uh issue to
[15:51] many voters um so I think that's
[15:54] definitely a step in the right direction
[15:56] absolutely and you mentioned Michael SOS
[15:58] is really interesting thing um I just
[16:00] saw it a little bit what what exactly
[16:02] actually did he do with this 42 billion
[16:05] I don't I did not see it on did not
[16:07] fully understand what he he did with
[16:09] such a huge amount of money oh I I guess
[16:11] it was in the Q3 um presentation that
[16:14] was done uh a few days ago and he was
[16:17] just explaining how their intention is
[16:19] to become a Bitcoin treasury company
[16:21] like Bitcoin first although they have
[16:23] the um Enterprise software business um
[16:28] they're just going full speed into new
[16:31] financial instruments new way of
[16:33] obtaining either debt financing or
[16:35] Equity financing to invest in Bitcoin uh
[16:38] to invest in infrastructure to support
[16:40] their
[16:41] movement years ago when you had the
[16:43] Playbook like the the Bitcoin for
[16:45] corporations the idea was like let's
[16:47] have other people at least as I
[16:48] understood it let's have other
[16:49] corporations copy what we did but it is
[16:52] such an Innovative thing and there's so
[16:53] many so many boards that maybe are not
[16:56] as like you say we're early adop there
[16:59] just there's so many reasons why they
[17:00] can't accept it yet you know and so it
[17:03] seems like they are just going to be the
[17:05] leader in the space to try and
[17:07] experiment with different ways of
[17:10] increasing adoption in the corporate
[17:12] world and so I don't know exactly how it
[17:16] will pan out but it seems like a very
[17:19] optimistic um forward-looking
[17:21] perspective like he even framed it
[17:23] compared to something like oil and like
[17:25] all of the different ways in which that
[17:27] industry grow grew over time so it's
[17:30] like not just thinking of Bitcoin as
[17:32] maybe a money thinking of it as a
[17:35] multi-layered uh technology almost like
[17:38] Andreas Antonopoulos talked about like
[17:40] um Bitcoin is the internet of money and
[17:42] um maybe micro strategy being a conduit
[17:45] for that in the corporate world yeah
[17:47] it's
[17:47] it's it's the best backup uh the best
[17:51] what is it the best recovery story ever
[17:53] in in in in
[17:55] the history of of companies probably
[17:58] because you see
[17:59] massive R they had in the Buble and then
[18:02] came now they actually coming close to
[18:04] the high of the Buble again that would
[18:07] be that would be one massive story yeah
[18:11] yeah and sometimes it takes an
[18:12] asymmetric bet like this to affect
[18:15] change in the world and it's definitely
[18:17] a volatile company like micro strategy
[18:19] is far more volatile than Bitcoin itself
[18:22] because of the lever bets that he has
[18:24] made and um also the custody aspect is
[18:28] relevant at least to a lot of people
[18:30] who've been Bitcoin been in Bitcoin
[18:31] longer than him um where are those coins
[18:36] held you know is that considered a
[18:38] Honeypot will there be like a 60102 you
[18:41] know one day maybe they'll have more
[18:42] power than they should uh so it'll be
[18:44] some sort of compromise it's like a
[18:46] certain percent of his shares are owned
[18:48] by Black Rock and Vanguard um but at the
[18:50] end of the day Bitcoin is supposed to be
[18:52] an inclusive technology so as I like to
[18:55] say you know we learn more when we
[18:56] disagree he's doing what he can to the
[18:59] best of his abilities with the brain
[19:01] power experience and resources he has
[19:02] and so too are the original bitcoiners
[19:04] and the new bitcoiners who might
[19:06] disagree with that perspective like
[19:07] collectively they seem to make the
[19:09] network stronger and more
[19:11] resilient I mean the the whole point is
[19:13] like you should have the option of doing
[19:16] what you want to do with your Bitcoin
[19:18] and if you want to collaborate with a B
[19:20] big company then go ahead do that uh you
[19:24] might run in the risk of losing them uh
[19:27] because you maybe cannot trust trust
[19:28] that third party or maybe it's
[19:30] confiscated with that but that's on you
[19:33] not not on the Bitcoin Community if
[19:35] micro strategy loses their Bitcoin
[19:37] tomorrow um depends on how they lose it
[19:40] but it's either gift to the community or
[19:43] or something bad for the community but
[19:45] it doesn't affect Bitcoin long term like
[19:48] Bitcoin will still do its thing uh so
[19:52] I'm like yeah like how why do you care
[19:55] how Michael saor and micro strategy
[19:58] holds the Bitcoin like it's not your
[20:00] Bitcoin if you're a micro strategy
[20:01] shareholder then you might care about
[20:04] how they do it but if you're just like a
[20:06] Bitcoin like why do you even why do you
[20:08] even care what he says about uh how he
[20:11] uh CES his Bitcoin you you can do it
[20:15] however you want to do it there are all
[20:17] the options out there in the world there
[20:18] are literally so many options to self
[20:20] custody or not self custody your Bitcoin
[20:23] uh I always advocate for self custody to
[20:26] actually go ahead and do that but if you
[20:28] don't want do it like it's your risk I I
[20:30] don't care that that yeah yeah it's
[20:33] interesting the caring question it's
[20:35] like I don't know many people who really
[20:37] care about their stocks they really care
[20:38] about their bonds but people have an
[20:40] emotional connection to their Bitcoin no
[20:42] matter how much or how little it's just
[20:44] it's like their baby it's like a child
[20:46] don't speak ill of my Bitcoin it upsets
[20:48] me sir but uh it's just I can't
[20:51] understand it other than in that framing
[20:53] so it's like people take it so
[20:55] personally it just it's such a
[20:57] deep-seated
[20:59] um thing um it it has more in common
[21:02] with like a living thing than it does
[21:04] with like a you know an inanimate thing
[21:06] so I think that I really enjoy that
[21:09] perspective it's like and and and it
[21:11] means that people who when they dispute
[21:13] things like he's forced to go and
[21:14] clarify if he says something in a
[21:16] podcast that upsets people like because
[21:18] they just are so invested in its success
[21:21] they care so much about how it is
[21:23] perceived what it means to them uh you
[21:26] can't dismiss that whereas like with a
[21:28] stock it's like okay the market
[21:30] sentiment has changed it's like I've
[21:32] never heard anyone really be as
[21:33] passionate about any stock with the
[21:35] exception of perhaps like Tesla or apple
[21:37] you know they have a lot of a lot of
[21:39] proponents who really really root them
[21:41] on who have gone all in on on those
[21:43] stocks but with Bitcoin is just like
[21:44] people just really care about it a lot
[21:46] and I think that's that's uh one of its
[21:49] strengths why do you think uh it is that
[21:52] people care about Bitcoin so much and
[21:55] what maybe is is the similarities to
[21:58] like Tesla because I was a I was all in
[22:01] Tesla before I was all in Bitcoin so I
[22:03] actually like it's funny that you said
[22:05] Tesla because I'm one that completely
[22:06] switched over from a a Tesla harder to a
[22:11] Bitcoin hard corer uh I'm I'm way more
[22:14] hardore about Bitcoin then ever was
[22:16] about Tesla but that's another story but
[22:19] why do you think that is I think it's
[22:21] the ideology there's a guy I don't if
[22:23] you know Jason debolt he's an all-in
[22:24] Tesla investor I followed him for a
[22:26] while on Twitter and like he just really
[22:29] believes in it like he just believes in
[22:31] it his ideology is so strong it's like
[22:33] the future will be electric cars the
[22:35] future will be behind Elon Musk and the
[22:38] things that he believes in I just think
[22:40] it goes beyond the investment people
[22:42] just have a a picture of a better world
[22:45] and and they just they can't help but
[22:48] put everything every thought every
[22:50] emotion behind that thing that they
[22:52] believe in like it just it's not it's
[22:55] not treated like a normal like a job
[22:57] that's like oh I'm an account like I'm
[22:59] not really that passionate about it I
[23:00] don't tell everyone what I do you know
[23:02] it's it's just it's a it's something I
[23:05] do you know to provide for my family but
[23:07] there's just something like emotional
[23:09] connection almost an intuition that you
[23:10] know that this is really important and
[23:12] you feel that you need to evangelize it
[23:14] in such a way that others can value its
[23:16] importance and sometimes in doing so you
[23:19] have to sacrifice your reputation or
[23:21] what you once were in order to do the
[23:23] right thing for it um I do see that in
[23:26] Bitcoin a lot and that's kind of what
[23:29] I've become as well it's like I can't
[23:31] imagine a world now where I haven't done
[23:33] what I've done it's like there's
[23:35] trade-offs to investing in Bitcoin it's
[23:36] volatile you know not everyone believes
[23:37] in it it's like it's hard to get you
[23:39] know a profession in the traditional
[23:40] World once you think this way but I
[23:42] would never go back I would never go
[23:44] back like I believe in the ideology of
[23:46] what it represents and that it's a way
[23:48] for us to have a better future so the
[23:50] Tesla people believe that too it's just
[23:52] that they're framing it a little bit
[23:53] different than the bitcoiners absolutely
[23:56] and the impressive thing about Bitcoin
[23:58] Co is like Tesla has a Visionary leader
[24:01] who is on podcast they have a big
[24:03] marketing budget uh they have a lot of
[24:05] people um thinking about how how do we
[24:10] sell uh Tesla they make events around
[24:13] that they make a very well designed
[24:15] product with a lot of love to to
[24:18] actually make also that transition yeah
[24:20] with Bitcoin it it's just a white paper
[24:24] like there was just a white paper coming
[24:26] out and everything else here is because
[24:30] someone was caring so so deeply about it
[24:34] that actually he created something a
[24:36] company that onboards people custody
[24:39] device a hardware wallet whatever it is
[24:42] like that's the impressive part to be
[24:44] honest like it's it just started with
[24:46] like a a few pages of white paper and
[24:49] and some emails back and forth from Z
[24:52] nakoto to other people like that that's
[24:54] super impressive for me yeah it's funny
[24:57] uh on the white paper day
[24:59] um there was a Canadian politician Joel
[25:01] lightbound and uh he did you know a one
[25:04] minute um I guess just a little a little
[25:08] speech in Parliament just celebrating
[25:10] the accomplishment of Bitcoin even if
[25:12] most people don't understand it and he
[25:14] used the example of Jack dorsy who
[25:15] called it one of the biggest
[25:16] developments in computer science in like
[25:18] the last 30 years and things that are
[25:20] this important may take 30 more years
[25:23] before we even grasp what it is and
[25:25] because there isn't a Founder because
[25:26] it's just based on the principles you
[25:28] know and that document um we're only
[25:30] slowly you know developing an
[25:32] understanding of what it is and where
[25:33] it's going to go so it's it's different
[25:35] than like a a founder-led company like
[25:37] Tesla it it's almost like a principles
[25:40] Le uh invention or technology that like
[25:44] there is no one person who's there to
[25:45] guide it it's like we must guide it and
[25:47] lead by example so it's fascinating to
[25:50] me what do you think Bitcoin at the end
[25:52] of the day is like it it's an it's a
[25:56] technology an asset how how would you
[25:58] like in in one word like wrap it up what
[26:01] what what Bitcoin is kind of hard for me
[26:03] I don't know it's just like but I don't
[26:06] think Bitcoin is about getting wealthy I
[26:09] don't know that like a lot of the
[26:11] Bitcoin is going to survive truthfully
[26:14] it's like because it's a bearer
[26:16] instrument um like in my profession now
[26:19] I work with a lot of bitcoiners and we
[26:21] talk about you know the awkward things
[26:23] in life like death divorce dementia you
[26:25] know all of the things that you know
[26:27] strip you of your wealth and and um over
[26:30] time but there are inevitabilities
[26:32] unfortunately it's just that like how
[26:35] many things are still here from hundreds
[26:37] or thousands of years ago um I like to
[26:39] think of artwork as a very fragile thing
[26:41] that is still here because we appreciate
[26:43] it its significance over time and how
[26:46] messages from the past could be travel
[26:49] you know into the future into our hands
[26:51] we could appreciate um in some sense
[26:53] what people once were like um if Bitcoin
[26:56] is no longer like in circulation but we
[27:00] understand its principles I think that
[27:02] we can be a better Society we can
[27:04] organize ourselves better you know like
[27:07] Michael saor frames it as an engineered
[27:08] mon monetary system but maybe it's an
[27:10] engineered uh humanitary system you know
[27:13] it's a way for us to function better as
[27:15] a society and with each other um because
[27:18] as you say if if there's big honey Poots
[27:21] at some of the exchanges and that
[27:23] Bitcoin is gone whoever's left with
[27:24] Bitcoin simply has more value there and
[27:27] if that Bitcoin is gone you know those
[27:29] people are left with more value so maybe
[27:30] we'll get to a point in history when
[27:32] there's only one left you know and it's
[27:34] infinitely divisible but we're left with
[27:36] the principles of what it meant so that
[27:39] the value of the Bitcoin was not so so
[27:41] much as important as the values it
[27:44] represented you know so I think that
[27:47] that's where it will go one day I think
[27:49] that's a greater meaning to us more so
[27:51] than it just being something you made a
[27:53] lot of money on and um you're able to
[27:56] pass down to your kids and your kids
[27:57] kids and go so I think it I think of
[27:59] Bitcoin as a
[28:01] generational um just generational
[28:05] to just generation just like a
[28:08] generational it's just like a like a way
[28:10] of framing your life like to think long
[28:12] long term but I can't think of it simply
[28:15] as wealth because like I don't know how
[28:16] exactly like my Bitcoin is going to be
[28:19] around for two 300 years like I don't
[28:20] know that that's possible um but I do
[28:23] know that the things that I stood for
[28:25] have a chance of being around for that
[28:26] long so long as I can pass that message
[28:29] down to my children they can pass it
[28:31] down to theirs like that to me is easier
[28:33] than passing down like a bare instrument
[28:35] like a Bitcoin like it's like do you
[28:37] mean by that that your Bitcoin gets lost
[28:40] along the way or Bitcoin is no longer
[28:44] there uh uh in like two 300 years either
[28:47] my Bitcoin gets lost along the way or
[28:50] Bitcoin no longer is there along the way
[28:52] but what it meant to us does not get
[28:54] lost you know it's like I don't own any
[28:57] really Val paintings but I know what
[28:59] they mean to me I can go see them in a
[29:01] gallery and I can look at that I can
[29:02] show my children and they can appreciate
[29:04] how much effort went into it I used to
[29:07] play the piano years ago and a lot of
[29:09] the songs that I used to play were
[29:12] composed by people who did so before
[29:14] there was electricity or they're done by
[29:16] candlelight you know and I look at how
[29:18] beautiful uh those pieces of music were
[29:20] and even the instruments they used um
[29:22] were not as advanced as the ones we have
[29:24] today but like my children don't need to
[29:27] play the piano to appreciate um the
[29:29] beauty of music you know they can know
[29:31] that I appreciate and they can listen to
[29:33] music and and think wow it's like I
[29:35] can't believe how that makes me feel
[29:36] better or makes me feel worse how it
[29:37] influences me so too with art like I
[29:40] think Bitcoin is more of an artistic
[29:42] thing like that more of like a
[29:43] fundamental thing more of a generational
[29:45] thing where you need to understand why
[29:47] why it was created why it needed to
[29:50] exist and why it evolved over time even
[29:52] if you never hold any because maybe no
[29:56] one will like there's so few Bitcoin in
[29:58] the world most people won't own it or if
[30:00] they own it they'll only own a
[30:01] fractional piece but that doesn't mean
[30:03] that they don't have to Value its
[30:05] importance you know in order for it to
[30:07] succeed I partnered up with coin
[30:10] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[30:13] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw

[31:09] bought some Bitcoin and now the most

[32:20] really powerful thing because even if
[32:23] and I think Bitcoin will be there for a
[32:25] long time but even if Bitcoin actually
[32:27] goes away
[32:28] the idea that the seed has been planted
[32:31] and we have even organized in groups
[32:35] about the idea of sound money about a
[32:37] better system so even if Bitcoin goes
[32:40] away tomorrow we still all know that
[32:44] sound money is the better idea that that
[32:47] all those principles that we learn in
[32:49] Bitcoin they don't go away and we will
[32:51] just go on and try the next thing as we
[32:55] will try as long as something suddenly
[32:59] all of the sudden works like like I'm
[33:03] really passionate now about getting
[33:06] money separated from State and getting a
[33:09] sound money system so even if Bitcoin
[33:12] goes away I will try with all I have to
[33:16] get a new system up and running with
[33:19] whatever is is possible in this new
[33:22] world because the idea is so strong and
[33:25] I think that's why people care that much
[33:27] about about the Bitcoin and how someone
[33:29] who has Bitcoin talks about Bitcoin and
[33:32] why they are so passionate about it even
[33:35] though it's just a white B it's just an
[33:38] idea but idea is so strong and so
[33:41] powerful that it actually makes a
[33:43] difference in the head I think that that
[33:45] that's uh that's the bottom line here I
[33:48] love that a lot yeah really cool yeah I
[33:50] like to you know ideas are bulletproof
[33:52] they say you know the movie V for
[33:53] Vendetta but I look at Bitcoin it was
[33:55] just for me it was a ladder to a better
[33:56] life and or without Bitcoin going
[33:59] forward I'm a better person everything I
[34:01] do in life I I think more thoughtfully
[34:04] about you know and it also uh you
[34:07] require an ego death in a way to be a
[34:09] bitcoiner because a lot of people are
[34:10] going to doubt you a lot of people are
[34:11] going to challenge you you know a lot of
[34:13] people are going to ignore you but you
[34:15] still have to be Resolute as you say in
[34:16] your ideas your ideology of how it can
[34:19] Empower others to be better um that's a
[34:21] greater message than maybe you can make
[34:23] a lot of money or you can you can be
[34:26] part of a technological Revolution it
[34:28] just it's just such a deeper thing and
[34:31] even with yourself it's like I I like
[34:32] listening to your podcast because you
[34:34] you ask the deeper questions you probe a
[34:35] little bit more like it can't just be
[34:37] about something so simplistic it has to
[34:39] be more but what's more about me and is
[34:41] different than what's more about you you
[34:43] know like everyone has a unique
[34:44] perspective about Bitcoin and how they
[34:46] can contribute to it because otherwise
[34:47] it was just an investment you would just
[34:49] buy it and go back to your normal life
[34:50] like why do people feel they need to
[34:52] contribute to it like why do they think
[34:54] that matters maybe it doesn't it's just
[34:57] you have to it forces you to be humble
[34:59] like to humbly appreciate it um however
[35:02] small your contribution might be every
[35:04] contribution means
[35:06] something I love that a lot yeah it's
[35:08] it's it's really true um I also love the
[35:12] idea of egoe I also love that Jeff Bo is
[35:15] uh calling the the company ego def
[35:17] capital I always have to think about
[35:19] that the name is so so so cool um you
[35:23] also said something uh Bitcoin is
[35:26] generational a lot of people say x
[35:30] amount of Bitcoin is generational wealth
[35:33] and I think generation gener
[35:35] generational wealth you you mentioned a
[35:37] little bit earlier in the conversation
[35:38] once um I always wondered like what does
[35:41] this even mean like what do we mean by
[35:44] General General generational
[35:48] generalization you know what I mean
[35:50] sorry it's the idea that you already
[35:53] have enough like it's you already have
[35:56] more than you could ever spend so how do
[35:59] you Steward that wealth correctly into
[36:02] the future there are those who look at
[36:04] it in terms of how do I mitigate taxes
[36:06] there are those who look at it how do I
[36:08] secure the custody and there are those
[36:10] who think a little bit bigger about how
[36:12] do I secure that this ideology across
[36:15] time um you know it's in New York City
[36:18] they have like Rockefeller Plaza you
[36:20] know one of the wealthiest most powerful
[36:22] families in history and it's like you
[36:24] can walk through that area and just
[36:26] appreciate you know appreciate what they
[36:28] built what it meant it's just like you
[36:30] don't need to go to a Wikipedia page to
[36:32] understand like that that that name
[36:33] means something uh in North America but
[36:37] how you gonna how you gonna make sure
[36:38] that your name means something or the
[36:39] Bitcoin means something because because
[36:41] someone inherits the money because you
[36:43] have a big house you have a big
[36:44] portfolio you know because you have a
[36:46] lot of things it's it's not so easy to
[36:48] do so to think gener generationally I
[36:53] think is to think in an analog way it's
[36:56] just like how is it that you're a good
[36:58] person so you may go to church you know
[37:00] because there are a lot of principles
[37:01] that are passed on historically through
[37:03] church but like Bitcoin is kind of a
[37:04] religious undertone in many ways so it's
[37:07] like how are you going to make sure that
[37:09] like what the Bitcoin meant to you um is
[37:12] valued by your heirs maybe two or 3
[37:14] hundred years from now and I don't think
[37:16] that's like a that's a traditional
[37:17] question that we answer so I've tried to
[37:19] frame it as like just at least facing
[37:22] the possibility that if tomorrow
[37:23] something were to happen to you if you
[37:24] were to pass away um or you were to get
[37:27] sick or your your mind to were to go um
[37:30] because there was some freak accident
[37:32] like how would you encapsulate all of
[37:34] the ways in which Bitcoin changed you uh
[37:37] into the Next Generation and so it's
[37:40] like I don't think that like just giving
[37:41] someone to the access to the private
[37:43] Keys is is the way I don't necessarily
[37:45] think that like them having access to a
[37:46] big portfolio is the way um it's more of
[37:49] like how can I how can I create some
[37:52] picture of what I was for them and
[37:54] that's why like a painting is really
[37:56] good for that like uh um a musical
[37:58] instrument um or a piece of music that
[38:00] someone plays is really good for that I
[38:02] just try and think of it in terms of the
[38:03] generations like how do you how do you
[38:05] do that because I find that like if you
[38:08] had built up wealth over 50 75 years
[38:10] let's say um there's been like a
[38:13] sequence like over time where like
[38:15] you've done it gradually but you have to
[38:17] do that like I said in a compressed
[38:18] fashion now with Bitcoin because you
[38:20] might have built up that same amount of
[38:21] wealth in only 10 years maybe only five
[38:23] years if you bu micro strategy um you
[38:26] can't so easy IL move that knowledge to
[38:29] the Next
[38:31] Generation interesting how did uh
[38:34] Bitcoin change you as as you mentioned
[38:37] so whereas previously I was more of a
[38:40] capitalist uh someone who would work and
[38:42] do tax returns financial analysis
[38:44] accounting for people I'm finding that
[38:47] like the patronage and philanthropy
[38:49] element to be a better use of my skill
[38:51] set um how can you give back to bitcoin
[38:54] like for me it's like evangelizing it in
[38:56] in the you know the professionalism that
[38:58] I possess but also like how can you
[39:00] Empower others to give back who have
[39:03] large amounts of wealth and I believe
[39:05] that you know just as a contribution to
[39:08] the Bitcoin Network were to occur should
[39:10] you die with your private keys or lose
[39:12] your private Keys you can also give up a
[39:16] lot of your wealth by being a patron for
[39:20] a cultural you know interest that you
[39:23] have um Michael sailor references you
[39:26] know it's like you could in delwa park a
[39:29] museum an art gallery you could do many
[39:31] different things so many bitcoiners have
[39:33] invested in the infrastructure like of
[39:35] uh companies that uh support private uh
[39:39] support custody uh self- custody or they
[39:42] support um investments in
[39:45] underprivileged communities in the world
[39:48] um it's more thinking about how you can
[39:49] give back I guess I would say it's like
[39:51] that's the the contribution that I make
[39:53] now because it's not a question that as
[39:54] many people ask but there's quite a few
[39:56] people who've been through a few Cycles
[39:58] now they just like I said they they have
[39:59] more than they need but um this is a way
[40:01] for their their um ideologies to move
[40:05] through time and be appreciated by those
[40:07] who come after them and and understand
[40:09] like um why they did what they
[40:12] did that's that's powerful also the idea
[40:15] of should you like what do you do with
[40:18] your Bitcoin on once you're gone uh give
[40:21] it do you give it to your kids do you
[40:23] give it to uh someone close to you uh do
[40:26] you give it to charity to some kind of
[40:28] organization or do you just like lose
[40:30] the keys so you give it to everyone
[40:33] that's also really powerful idea and I
[40:37] think maybe people that are a little bit
[40:40] earlier now into Bitcoin or like more of
[40:43] like in the in the beginning stages of
[40:45] the Bitcoin Journey uh they don't
[40:47] understand now why it's so powerful to
[40:51] uh throw away your key and make it a
[40:54] contribution there like why why is that
[40:56] like why is uh that such a big chest do
[40:59] when you die you die with your Bitcoin
[41:02] MH yeah s says it's the ultimate is the
[41:05] ultimate Act of altruism to die with
[41:07] your private Keys it may well be you're
[41:09] not taking them with you you know except
[41:11] that you can you know it's like but you
[41:14] have an opportunity if you don't take
[41:15] them with you to give them to someone
[41:17] else who needs them more than you um not
[41:20] many forms of wealth are able to do that
[41:23] you know in such a powerful way and also
[41:26] in such a strong way it sends such a
[41:29] strong message to do that it's just like
[41:31] they they believed in the IDE ideology
[41:33] so much they couldn't figure out what to
[41:35] do with it so they just contributed to
[41:37] everyone by dying with those keys maybe
[41:39] that's the best option like wouldn't
[41:40] that be a uh Paradox of wealth you know
[41:44] that you build up so much and that the
[41:46] lesson is like I didn't need it anymore
[41:48] let everyone else have it and if we keep
[41:50] doing that collectively over the
[41:51] generations whoever's left with it you
[41:53] know just has has proportionately more
[41:55] because there are only 21 million B coin
[41:57] it's just they're strange philosophical
[42:00] questions to ponder and not ones that we
[42:01] were able to do before because if you
[42:03] had some gold some silver some stocks
[42:05] some bonds some real estate all of those
[42:08] like are are going to change hands like
[42:10] someone else is going to pick them up
[42:11] like Bitcoin is that one thing that that
[42:13] that can't like once you lose those keys
[42:16] you cannot retrieve them you cannot so
[42:19] everyone else is wealthier because of
[42:21] them or it's powerful yeah like it's the
[42:24] only thing Bitcoin is the only thing
[42:27] that you can take with you to the Crave
[42:30] yeah but at the same time with taking it
[42:33] with you you actually contributing it
[42:36] out to everyone it's it's it's a funny
[42:39] like never saw it like that it's an
[42:40] interesting perspective because you you
[42:43] you you take it with you but you you
[42:46] don't really take it with you because
[42:47] you you don't use it when you're dead uh
[42:51] even like I actually believe I do
[42:55] believe that but maybe there's some
[42:57] someone else but it's uh it's pretty
[42:59] pretty fascinating thought to to think
[43:02] about that uh for a second like oh like
[43:05] I I did not think about that in in that
[43:07] way before really interesting yeah and
[43:09] truth it trou it troubled me because
[43:12] it's like that's not how I was trained
[43:14] to think about something it's like the
[43:15] technology itself is is profound it's
[43:18] like there's nothing else like that so
[43:21] how can you frame an understanding of
[43:22] what what to do upon passing like I said
[43:25] death divorce dementia whatever the
[43:27] tragedy is that befalls you it's like
[43:30] you can't frame it with the
[43:31] understanding of the own world you have
[43:32] to come up with a new way of thinking
[43:33] about it you have to come way come up
[43:35] with a new way of trying to secure it
[43:38] across time you know it's like across
[43:41] space sure it's like you're into custody
[43:43] or it's going to be in a paper asset
[43:44] like an ETF but across time there
[43:47] something that's a bare instrument and
[43:49] if you do nothing you forget about it
[43:51] just goes away and everyone else is
[43:52] wealthier it's not easy to answer and
[43:54] it's too early in its Journey it's like
[43:56] some of the wealthiest bitcoiners are
[43:57] still quite young still quite young the
[44:00] ogs they call they call themselves some
[44:01] of them um so you wouldn't normally be
[44:04] asking yourself these questions you
[44:05] might only get life insurance you know
[44:07] when you have a child um but
[44:09] generational wealth when you're in your
[44:11] your 30s your 40s and the type of wealth
[44:13] that you have that people be lucky to
[44:15] have if they're in their 60s or 70s if
[44:17] they're unbelievably successful it's as
[44:20] much as it's an opportunity it's also a
[44:21] burden there's such a great
[44:23] responsibility that comes with being
[44:25] wealthy let alone this type of wealth
[44:27] you know that that could have do so much
[44:30] good in the world like that's on your
[44:32] shoulders you know so you almost it's
[44:34] not really a financial question you know
[44:37] it's more of like like I said a
[44:38] philosophical question it's like to
[44:39] ponder you know and to ask others
[44:41] because I've talked to a lot of
[44:42] bitcoiners like with who have that type
[44:44] of wealth and I haven't found a
[44:45] consensus yet of like oh this is the one
[44:48] thing to recommend it's like it's like
[44:50] ymmb you know your mileage may vary no
[44:53] one person has a solution that is
[44:55] absolute every solution is is uniquely
[44:58] tailored to the person and none of them
[45:00] may be good Solutions we like we can't
[45:02] know we won't know until later whether
[45:03] or not they work um but there have been
[45:06] bitcoiners who've passed away there have
[45:07] been bitcoiners who have moved their
[45:09] wealth like mechanically at least um
[45:12] that can be done it's just you know
[45:15] philosophically did you move your wealth
[45:17] the way that you intended to like we
[45:19] won't know that until after you're gone
[45:21] so that's why I I find it fascinating to
[45:22] to to discuss it's it's it's super
[45:25] fascinating the to think about the all
[45:28] the implications also the freedom that
[45:31] uh Bitcoin all of the sudden gives you
[45:33] uh it's it's uh like first you you think
[45:37] about okay like if if you have a
[45:38] business you need a bank account and
[45:40] therefore you KC there like just the
[45:42] implications of like okay you can now
[45:44] have a business that's available in the
[45:47] internet you can accept in Bitcoin and
[45:50] you can pay in Bitcoin you completely
[45:53] outside of the feeld system at that
[45:54] point you don't need any KC you are
[45:57] somewhere in the internet obviously the
[45:59] person that does that is still in
[46:01] political jurisdiction and somewhere uh
[46:05] but even there are solutions for that to
[46:07] be uh maximize your freedom but but that
[46:10] but that thing you just like put Bitcoin
[46:13] out there and it's completely outside of
[46:16] the other system that was a huge moment
[46:18] that I just like had this last month
[46:20] where I'm like oh yeah like put out a
[46:23] website a domain uh you offer some
[46:26] service product on there you only accept
[46:28] Bitcoin so you don't need a bank account
[46:31] and you only pay other people in Bitcoin
[46:33] so you don't need a bank account and
[46:35] then you are like completely free of
[46:36] that system it's fascinating that it's
[46:38] impossible now it is and I do feel like
[46:41] the bitcoiners live we live in a
[46:42] parallel world we really do like you
[46:45] said it's like you can live and I've met
[46:47] people in you know Central America they
[46:48] just literally they collect their their
[46:51] income in Bitcoin they pay their
[46:52] expenses in Bitcoin there's no trusted
[46:54] intermediary between them and they live
[46:57] good lives they live good lives
[46:59] unbeknownst to most people in the
[47:00] traditional World um what if Humanity
[47:03] forks and there's those who live in that
[47:05] system and those who don't um it's
[47:07] fascinating like like like you say to to
[47:10] to be able to that we even have such a
[47:12] system you know outside of the
[47:14] parameters control now it's like there
[47:15] are practical considerations you still
[47:17] are going to have a passport you know
[47:19] you're still GNA you're still going to
[47:20] pass one day it's like there are things
[47:21] you're going to have to interact with in
[47:22] the system but the fact that this other
[47:24] one exists and the IDE ideology is just
[47:27] so different um I hope that we find
[47:31] consensus one day you know between the
[47:33] two they merge in some way that the
[47:35] traditional system maybe is more
[47:36] accountable and so too is the Bitcoin
[47:39] system so that we can coexist do you
[47:41] think so so you think that the Fiat
[47:43] system will uh actually coexist with uh
[47:46] the Bitcoin system or you're talking
[47:47] about na States uh coexisting with with
[47:50] Bitcoin I think that's something as
[47:52] powerful as Bitcoin puts pressure on the
[47:54] traditional system to function better um
[47:57] the inflation rates are too high you
[47:59] know it's like the government overreach
[48:01] is too much uh we shouldn't have the
[48:03] censorship we do but in the absence of
[48:05] an
[48:06] accountability uh like a Bitcoin a
[48:09] technological accountability um will
[48:11] those systems ever improve or will they
[48:13] just continue to get worse like
[48:14] unchecked power is not good so that's
[48:16] why it's like a rules-based system
[48:18] without a ruler like a Bitcoin is a
[48:21] principles based approach that I think
[48:22] the world was once founded on but we
[48:24] seem to have lost along the way there's
[48:26] a guy I follow on Twitter Brian relli
[48:28] and he talks about this generation being
[48:30] the Amnesia generation whereby you know
[48:32] we've gotten to a point now where we
[48:34] store our family pictures we store our
[48:35] memories of the past digitally but a lot
[48:37] of the analog videos and things like
[48:39] they're not be they're not being
[48:41] uploaded to the speed that they should
[48:42] be so once they're gone and once we're
[48:45] gone it's like the only history that
[48:46] will exist is on the internet you know
[48:49] is on what you can find digitally but
[48:52] Bitcoin is an immutable transparent
[48:54] subledger so like that system will
[48:57] always be there and so if things are
[48:59] inscribed in history even if it's just a
[49:01] transaction if a transaction it's it's
[49:04] arguably a more accurate depiction of
[49:06] History because you cannot change it you
[49:08] cannot break the chain um so I just
[49:12] think that is Bitcoin the solution is
[49:13] the other system the solution maybe
[49:15] Bitcoin just forcing the other system to
[49:17] be accountable and vice versa is a
[49:19] better a better consensus I like to call
[49:22] it the Nakamoto consensus it's like we
[49:24] disagree with elements of the Fiat
[49:26] system the Fiat system disagrees with
[49:27] elements of the Bitcoin system but if
[49:29] nothing else human beings are resilient
[49:31] across history all the wars and the
[49:33] fighting we've had we're still we're
[49:34] still here we haven't destroyed
[49:36] ourselves I don't know if it's a game
[49:37] theory type of logic because there are
[49:39] nuclear weapons in the world that but no
[49:41] one uses them um maybe Bitcoin is that
[49:44] type of technology that type of that
[49:46] type of strength that we can utilize as
[49:50] a learning experience for the future to
[49:53] be better maybe that's why it was
[49:54] invented because as they say it was it
[49:56] was brought on by the Great Recession
[49:59] back in 2008 like that's it it almost
[50:01] like mandated its
[50:03] creation that's uh that's fascinating
[50:06] when we think about uh there are those
[50:08] nuclear weapons and they're not used in
[50:11] the same way maybe when Bitcoin is
[50:14] around the money printer is around but
[50:17] they're not going to use because they
[50:18] know if they print 20% of the currency
[50:22] this year Bitcoin will Moon and this
[50:25] will uh further devalue and put get the
[50:30] trust out of their system so kind of
[50:33] Bitcoin puts an alarm Bell a a check on
[50:37] uh that that system that that's a
[50:39] fascinating thought of like Bitcoin
[50:41] being the alarm Bell the the the the
[50:44] fire alarm uh of of of the the fear
[50:47] system the scoreboard of uh of how bad
[50:50] the fear system is actually doing yeah I
[50:54] love that framing of it as a fire alarm
[50:56] like you don't need to pull it but it is
[50:57] there just in case something happens and
[50:59] if you pull it the Cavalry will come
[51:02] absolutely that's also why I I usually
[51:05] say that I I I I don't want Bitcoin to
[51:08] go to 1 million next year because that
[51:11] would mean the Fiat system is seriously
[51:14] in stress and anodes and that itself
[51:20] from a theoretical standpoint would be
[51:22] great uh but from a practical standpoint
[51:25] this means you family will suffer your
[51:28] neighbors will suffer people that you
[51:30] love that don't have Bitcoin will suffer
[51:33] uh and I don't wish that for anyone I I
[51:36] would like a small organic growth over
[51:39] time so we can dive into that Bitcoin
[51:42] revolutions uh slowly I don't need a
[51:44] million dollar Bitcoin next year I don't
[51:46] want that actually I don't think anyone
[51:49] does success at the expense of someone
[51:51] else's failure I don't think that's
[51:53] that's appropriate um and if Bitcoin
[51:55] does do that it it's basically just a
[51:57] duplicate of the system we already have
[51:59] you know it'll be like all the people
[52:01] with the Bitcoin The Haves and then the
[52:02] Have Nots that's why I believe like
[52:04] consensus will need to be found and I
[52:05] believe it will be found um even to
[52:08] think that Bitcoin would be a political
[52:10] um talking point now um only a short
[52:15] year since it was founded after as you
[52:17] say you know Donald Trump and other
[52:18] politicians um and Michael Sor you know
[52:21] other prominent people uh dismissed it
[52:23] they can't dismiss it anymore but that's
[52:25] a good thing that's a it's a good thing
[52:26] maybe it becomes more normalized and
[52:28] people just appreciate that it exists
[52:29] and they behave a little bit better and
[52:31] we live in peace at least for a little
[52:33] while longer uh rather than um another
[52:36] uh cataclysmic uh financial disaster or
[52:39] geopolitical War um in which you know
[52:43] assets like that can really increase in
[52:46] value same thing with gold and silver um
[52:49] hard assets like a digital a digital
[52:50] scarcity like a Bitcoin it's like I I
[52:52] just I prefer not to see that world
[52:54] also absolutely yeah it's it's
[52:57] fascinating for me it's but we already
[53:00] uh um very far again um it's it's really
[53:04] interesting you talk about that kind of
[53:07] side of of Bitcoin but there's one
[53:08] question that I always ask my guests and
[53:10] I'm really curious Al uh of your answer
[53:13] uh what can we learn from you besides in
[53:16] Bitcoin besides what what we discussed
[53:19] today already actually the the
[53:21] biggest biggest takeaway I found from
[53:24] Bitcoin uh is not about coin it's about
[53:27] the
[53:27] subculture um I used to think that the
[53:30] technology was about like a faster
[53:32] processor you know a faster physical
[53:35] processor um you know from a 286 to a
[53:38] Pentium whatever speeds we're at now or
[53:40] more memory solid state drive um but I'm
[53:44] finding like the the biggest takeaway is
[53:47] just the power of perception on the
[53:50] internet and how
[53:52] memes and other strange technological
[53:56] techniques can actually help educate you
[53:59] in a different way than like sort of
[54:01] like a traditional reading of the white
[54:03] paper um reading of books like those
[54:06] things can influence like what you think
[54:08] about the world and the future so I'm
[54:11] I'm just more fascinated with like how
[54:13] Bitcoin has moved that way that like
[54:16] online like it's quite an egalitarian
[54:18] system but those who can leverage um the
[54:21] tools of technology and the way that
[54:23] they move forward it's more of like a
[54:25] soft techn technology so a tweet or a
[54:28] meme or a short video it's like those
[54:31] are things that like people have shared
[54:33] with me and that I've experimented with
[54:35] myself and I can't even believe the
[54:37] power that they possess because to have
[54:39] wealth is one thing you know to believe
[54:41] in a Bitcoin is one thing but but to be
[54:42] able to influence others to believe in
[54:44] it is such a great power and Andre
[54:47] karpathy is a computer scientist he
[54:49] talks about you know how one day maybe
[54:51] you won't even will regret that we gave
[54:53] people access to our brains through the
[54:56] internet that like the things that you
[54:58] look at on Instagram the things you look
[55:00] at on Twitter on videos they're
[55:01] influencing your mind in ways you can't
[55:03] predict so it's like as much as like we
[55:05] rail against the censorship we
[55:07] underestimate how as bitcoiners we are
[55:09] influencing other people in the way that
[55:12] they think Beyond just the money just
[55:14] because of our ability to channel
[55:16] technology like Bitcoin it means you can
[55:18] Channel other technology unbeknownst to
[55:21] you um and and I do enjoy mixing it up
[55:24] with people on social media about but
[55:26] I'm not so naive to think that like we
[55:28] just don't know what the world will be
[55:30] because of that you know it's it's it's
[55:32] not just a it's not just a physical like
[55:35] like an actual thing Bitcoin it's it's a
[55:37] perception of a thing and we control
[55:39] that perception on there so that's one
[55:41] thing I would I would pass on to someone
[55:43] else is like don't underestimate um the
[55:45] things that you say and the impact that
[55:47] they can have on others bitcoin's not
[55:49] the only exponential technology that we
[55:51] use today and take for
[55:53] granted interesting that that that's a
[55:56] it's a fascinating thought like we we
[55:58] influence a lot uh and and we we kind of
[56:01] all like uh we we kind of
[56:04] correct everyone in our uh Community all
[56:07] the time like we are mirroring what
[56:08] other people are doing and we uh have
[56:11] those mini Corrections when when people
[56:14] interact with other people and everyone
[56:16] sees that like if if you are uh I don't
[56:20] know with with your with your wife with
[56:22] your girlfriend you alone you act
[56:25] differently as you would act like on a
[56:28] panel talking to other people in front
[56:31] of like thousand people or as you would
[56:33] act with uh your uh best friend group or
[56:36] something like like there's always like
[56:38] those like that our environment
[56:40] influences so much and you don't even
[56:42] realize it how much so it's really
[56:45] powerful I like that a lot really really
[56:47] cool that you brought about in brought
[56:49] that up in the in the podcast I like
[56:51] that a lot really cool thanks perfect
[56:54] okay yeah uh I would like to go to the
[56:57] end routine now um or or is there
[56:59] something else you you want to add to
[57:01] this to this point no no go ahead happy
[57:04] to perfect perfect then let's go to the
[57:05] tin where the previous guest ask a
[57:07] question for the next guest without
[57:09] knowing who the next guest actually is
[57:11] uh and this is an interesting one what
[57:13] was your last Eureka moment your last
[57:16] moment of like oh like that that's
[57:18] an interesting uh
[57:20] Discovery my Bitcoin doesn't matter it
[57:23] doesn't
[57:24] matter like no matter how well wealthy I
[57:27] get um how much success I find in my
[57:30] life all that matters is what my
[57:31] children think of me like what what kind
[57:34] of father I was to them uh whether I was
[57:36] there for them whether I helped them
[57:38] through the difficult times that like
[57:39] Bitcoin has just held me accountable
[57:42] because it solved one problem and made
[57:44] me realize I have many others to deal
[57:46] with so rather than like we put wealth
[57:49] on a pedestal we think that when I have
[57:51] money then I'm going to do this but all
[57:53] of a sudden when you have money you
[57:54] realize now what so like that's been the
[57:57] most humbling P like I guess perspective
[58:00] of my life that uh it's not the most
[58:02] important thing to me and it never was
[58:05] so it forces me to question all the
[58:06] other things I think are important and
[58:08] children to me are are my reflection so
[58:10] I just do the best I can every day to be
[58:12] a humble father and a humble servant and
[58:14] lead by example um while understanding
[58:17] that despite my best efforts I still
[58:19] continue to make mistakes and I'll have
[58:21] this continued awareness with the next
[58:22] accomplishment that I have um so keeps
[58:25] me honest
[58:27] yeah we we will never stop making
[58:29] mistakes but we uh all we we we should
[58:33] still try every day to do our best to uh
[58:36] get a little bit better than than
[58:37] yesterday I love that really really cool
[58:39] yeah perfect then yeah thank you so much
[58:42] uh John for for being on on the show
[58:44] before I let you go where can people

[58:50] one um or in LinkedIn if if you uh
[58:53] prefer my Professional Profile but um
[58:56] and yeah I just try and say something
[58:57] positive of Bitcoin each day try to be
[59:01] you know creative ironical um just like
[59:04] everyone else it's like I'm just a note
[59:05] in the network so take what I say with a
[59:07] grain of salt if I can help you with
[59:09] something great if I can't help you with
[59:10] something that's great too but I just
[59:13] enjoy interacting with fellow bitcoiners
[59:15] and and no coiners alike um because I
[59:18] learn from the interactions with uh with
[59:20] people and I really enjoy the digital
[59:22] world I think it's the future so um if
[59:24] you are if not on the digital world I
[59:26] don't think you exist anymore so anyone
[59:28] who's out there wants to mix it up I uh
[59:30] I I'm happy to oblige and have a
[59:32] conversation that's super interesting Al
[59:34] like if if you don't exist on the
[59:36] digital world you don't exist yet it's
[59:38] it definitely already feels like that
[59:41] for me uh if if someone comes up and
[59:44] like hey on on a on a conference hey U
