[00:00] at some point your mindset has to change
[00:02] and has to switch over to bitcoin and
[00:06] Satoshi and valuing everything that way
[00:09] once you make that mind shift and see
[00:12] Bitcoin as a unit of account it's
[00:14] mindblowing what it does to your brain
[00:16] Bitcoin will be the only way to
[00:19] communicate value motivation to get more
[00:22] Bitcoin is so
[00:24] high can you remember your first ever
[00:28] actual Bitcoin on transaction can you
[00:31] share a story of that is is is that
[00:34] still in your
[00:35] mind oh boy wow my
[00:41] um my goodness gracious I was not
[00:45] prepared for this um yeah no I I can't
[00:51] say specifically what it
[00:54] was
[00:57] um man it was well actually now that I
[01:01] say that let me let me go back it's
[01:03] coming back to me um I think it was
[01:08] 20 18 I want to maybe the end of 2017
[01:14] 2018 um I bought a little bit of Bitcoin
[01:20] because I heard of this uh shitcoin can
[01:25] I can I can I am I allowed to cuss on
[01:27] this all right um yeah uh called Ripple
[01:32] and xrp um and so I was really really
[01:38] you know new and fresh back then and
[01:40] didn't know anything and um yeah I
[01:44] managed to get myself a kraken account
[01:47] um and uh through them I bought Bitcoin
[01:52] which I then um sold or transferred into
[01:58] Ripple um
[02:00] and it was probably I uh I I didn't do
[02:04] much with it it sat there and I kind of
[02:07] forgot about it and um didn't really
[02:10] come back to bitcoin even until about 20
[02:14] early
[02:15] 2020 um before I finally kind of circled
[02:19] back to you know I think the price was
[02:23] pumping uh around that time or starting
[02:27] to there certainly was more news around
[02:30] Bitcoin at that time and so um I started
[02:33] looking into it again at that time and
[02:36] um yeah kind of got back into a little
[02:40] bit of altcoin land shitcoin
[02:42] land um with a you know just somebody
[02:47] that I happen to catch on YouTube um and
[02:51] on
[02:52] clubhouse um and yeah that that quickly
[02:58] turned into a a you know getting wrecked
[03:03] getting getting completely wiped out of
[03:05] my account uh and I went holy crap how
[03:08] did that happen and then you know then I
[03:11] really I was like because you know this
[03:13] Bitcoin thing was
[03:15] like it it made sense to me um and so I
[03:20] had to you know kind of re-engage myself
[03:25] and and start really digging into
[03:27] Bitcoin at that time and that was late
[03:30] 2020 um where I finally decided okay I I
[03:35] get this Bitcoin thing the rest of this
[03:37] crap I don't really understand um and
[03:40] just full-fledged went all in on bitcoin
[03:43] at that point so yeah I think grab grab
[03:47] describes it the the best way it's like
[03:50] I I also heard uh I think one of the
[03:53] best descriptions for altcoins is it it
[03:56] is a test net for for Bitcoin uh there
[03:59] can be a lot of things happening you can
[04:02] try stuff out and we know like if if
[04:06] it's a long term in the altcoin market
[04:08] uh it might be interesting to see if we
[04:11] can uh have this technology also on
[04:14] layer two or three on top of Bitcoin and
[04:16] implement it somehow uh which is is
[04:19] amazing to have some test net so I'm I'm
[04:22] I was really toxic two years I go
[04:24] against uh those uh uh altcoins but
[04:27] right now I'm like yeah it's good this
[04:29] should be there uh people should get
[04:32] people should get uh testet in there and
[04:35] uh if if because the information is out
[04:37] there if if you really wanna do the
[04:39] information you really want to dig deep
[04:41] you will know that Bitcoin is the only
[04:44] choice and if you don't do a good job in
[04:47] doing your homework you will lose money
[04:50] and that's a good thing that's that's
[04:52] like Darin that's like the free market
[04:54] it's it's okay if people get get wrecked
[04:57] I try my best and get the word out and
[04:58] I'm Bitcoin only will never promote
[05:00] anything else uh on there on here uh but
[05:04] yeah if people don't do their homework
[05:05] uh they they they deserve to to
[05:09] learn yeah absolutely I I agree with you
[05:13] 100% there it it really um it it's a
[05:17] process and uh I I do think it all
[05:21] benefits Bitcoin it just you know it
[05:24] spreads the word um and you know what
[05:29] what how does the saying go um something
[05:31] about bad marketing there's no such
[05:33] thing as like bad press you know kind of
[05:36] the thing so it's all good for Bitcoin H
[05:39] and the before we get into property
[05:41] manag man Management in Bitcoin I have
[05:44] one last question um how did you few the
[05:47] last like one two years uh in in Bitcoin
[05:50] change I think bitcoiners have a a lot
[05:52] of things that they are learning and at
[05:54] least for me I'm now like four or over
[05:57] four years in in Bitcoin really digging
[06:00] deep into the informations uh and my
[06:03] view of Bitcoin developed a lot every
[06:07] year and I'm wondering when this will
[06:12] stop Bitcoin but I think there's always
[06:15] like something new to learn how did what
[06:17] was the biggest learnings for you like
[06:19] the last one two years oh man here
[06:23] that's that's a question that could take
[06:25] the rest of the show probably um you
[06:28] know just I mean yeah absolutely um you
[06:31] know Bitcoin is I it's the proverbial
[06:35] rabbit hole that just keeps getting
[06:37] deeper and deeper every time you seem to
[06:39] diggle you know another inch into it you
[06:42] find the next inch that you go oh look
[06:44] at that or you know the the the squirrel
[06:47] kind of chasing the nut I mean it's like
[06:50] every every time you turn around there's
[06:52] something else to learn there's another
[06:55] there's another layer being built on top
[06:57] there's another use case that people are
[06:59] talking about
[07:00] there's uh the
[07:03] whole Community you know kind of shifts
[07:07] from you know certain phases I guess and
[07:12] is kind of going through oh I can't I
[07:15] guess I shouldn't be speaking for the
[07:17] whole Community um but you know it just
[07:21] seems like large portions of the
[07:24] community will talk about um you know
[07:28] how how Bitcoin will help SEC be more
[07:33] secure going forward or how you know
[07:37] Layer Two will make it more affordable
[07:39] for people or how now there's a lot of
[07:42] talk about how in in the future people
[07:45] won't be able to transact or afford to
[07:48] transact on layer one um due to due to
[07:53] the high fee kind of situation that
[07:55] there there may be um that people are
[07:58] you know predi ing or
[08:00] forecasting um and you know I'm I'm just
[08:04] kind of a dummy I don't know for sure
[08:06] how all of that is going to play out
[08:08] some of it certainly makes sense to me
[08:11] um it certainly makes sense that uh
[08:14] given the small number of or the
[08:18] scarcity of Bitcoin uh that are going to
[08:21] be out um 21 million you know and just
[08:26] divided by our population right now
[08:28] that's the not a lot of Bitcoin out
[08:31] there for everybody to have and so um it
[08:34] does kind of make sense to me that that
[08:36] there will be some slowing down of of
[08:38] the network or some uh increased speed
[08:41] to kind of minimize the smaller
[08:45] transactions that are occurring um you
[08:49] know it
[08:50] just oh
[08:52] boy um I'm just trying to trying to
[08:55] think here about um what other kind of
[08:59] view have shifted for me um you know I
[09:03] guess when I first was kind of digging
[09:06] in and learning more about Bitcoin you
[09:08] know I kind of was viewing it simply
[09:10] from the monetary standpoint from the
[09:12] from the value from the Fiat Value World
[09:16] right and and I think that's a shift
[09:19] that people go through when you when you
[09:21] start going oh hey you know Fiat dollars
[09:24] or Fiat pounds or Fiat whatever uh it it
[09:31] you
[09:32] can't always be valuing Bitcoin in those
[09:36] terms you get you gotta I think Jeff
[09:38] Booth
[09:39] mentions you're modeling or you're
[09:42] viewing the system from within the
[09:44] system right from from within the Fiat
[09:47] system and at some point your mindset
[09:50] has to change and has to switch over to
[09:53] bitcoin and Satoshi and valuing
[09:57] everything that way
[10:00] um that actually and actually is a good
[10:04] kind of segue into Property Management
[10:06] land a little bit I was I kind of this
[10:10] morning when I got into my office here I
[10:12] was sitting down and um my wife and I uh
[10:16] have purchased uh two small apartment
[10:19] buildings and one of them we purchased
[10:22] uh at the end of 2016 and December of
[10:25] 2016 um and I just was looking at the
[10:28] Bitcoin price at that time time um and
[10:31] you know it was about $11,000 a coin
[10:33] right then um and the building that we
[10:36] purchased you know was basically 300
[10:38] Bitcoin at that point in time um and
[10:42] today the value of that building so it
[10:45] was about
[10:46] $300,000 the value of that building is
[10:49] now worth about
[10:51] $550,000 in Fiat terms and in Bitcoin
[10:55] terms it's like eight Bitcoin nine
[10:57] Bitcoin something like that
[10:59] you know and it it's
[11:01] just seeing that on
[11:04] paper um just kind of makes me go man I
[11:08] should have been buying Bitcoin right
[11:10] right from the
[11:11] get-go um you know and I it it starts me
[11:16] thinking about just businesses in
[11:18] general and and
[11:21] how um how so many of us in the Bitcoin
[11:27] world right now even
[11:31] are I I think still falling into that
[11:34] Fiat mindset of valuing their business
[11:38] in Fiat terms even though they may be
[11:43] completely um using utilizing Bitcoin it
[11:48] it seems like there's still a big draw
[11:51] or at at least a tendency to value your
[11:55] business in Fiat terms and I think
[12:01] that's I don't want to say a problem per
[12:04] se um but I I think that it is not a uh
[12:12] long-term uh viable business model to
[12:16] run under I think we really have to do a
[12:19] good job and I'm sure there's companies
[12:21] out there again I'm you know four years
[12:24] into the space fairly new haven't dealt
[12:27] with a lot of companies that are Bitcoin
[12:29] only companies or you know even talk to
[12:32] a lot of venture capitalists or
[12:34] investors or anything like that at this
[12:36] point um and so my hope is that there
[12:39] are some companies out there that are
[12:42] doing
[12:43] things in a different in in a different
[12:46] business model than what would have been
[12:50] in the past um but it does seem to me
[12:53] like like there are a lot of there's
[12:56] there's a lot of tendency to just go
[12:58] back to that
[12:59] that way of thinking
[13:02] so um while I'm on that if if I can I'm
[13:07] um I did I crunched one more number and
[13:09] I um I thought about one of my tenants
[13:12] at at one of our properties is paying
[13:14] rent in Bitcoin
[13:16] currently and you know back in 2017
[13:19] their rent would have been about $800 a
[13:21] month in US dollar terms which is about
[13:25] 08 Bitcoin a month at that point right
[13:29] um so had I been collecting rent from
[13:32] them in Bitcoin at that point uh they'd
[13:35] have been paying me almost 10 Bitcoin a
[13:38] year 9.6 Bitcoin a year for rent just
[13:41] for one apartment and remember go back
[13:45] my building is now worth eight Bitcoin
[13:47] total right so in one year I would have
[13:50] collected enough Bitcoin to offset what
[13:54] my building is worth at this point in
[13:56] time and now today
[13:59] their rent has gone up to about $1,200 a
[14:02] month for that same apartment and
[14:05] they're now paying me
[14:06] 015 Bitcoin a month
[14:09] approximately um and so you know over
[14:12] the course of the year I'm collecting
[14:13] like 0.2 of a Bitcoin um it and it just
[14:19] is when I looked at those numbers this
[14:22] morning I went holy crap I should have
[14:26] been doing this a long time ago and I
[14:28] can
[14:29] you know I'm trying to project out
[14:31] forward and going you know what is my
[14:35] you know is my building really in four
[14:36] years or in the next seven years going
[14:38] to be worth you know point you know one
[14:42] Bitcoin and my rent is going to be point
[14:45] you know 10,000 soshi or 100,000 sosis a
[14:50] a
[14:51] month I I don't know I I'm you know it's
[14:55] it's on that path um and and to me that
[15:00] just is uh it's amazing and and if if
[15:06] people in the business world and in the
[15:08] property management World in particular
[15:11] um hear this and see this I I hope that
[15:14] they they listen and they at least give
[15:16] it some thought because um you know that
[15:20] that would have been just one of my
[15:21] Apartments out of my the the four
[15:24] apartments in that building um and you
[15:28] know to think that I could have today
[15:31] paid off that mortgage if I wanted to
[15:33] with the value of the Bitcoin that they
[15:35] would have paid seven years ago for one
[15:38] year it's just kind of mind-blowing
[15:41] amazing if it's like um once you make
[15:44] that mind shift uh and see Bitcoin as a
[15:48] unit of account uh and really do that
[15:52] it's mind blowing what it does to your
[15:54] brain like you are really cautious to
[15:57] spend uh and and all of the sudden you
[16:00] really want to earn more money I don't
[16:03] know if if you had the same experience
[16:05] but ever since I'm on a Bitcoin standard
[16:07] I mean for me it's kind of I'm also
[16:09] young because maybe there's this shift
[16:11] going anyways because I'm just 25 uh but
[16:15] uh ever since I save in Bitcoin this um
[16:20] motivation to get more Bitcoin is so
[16:23] high it's like I'm trying to figure out
[16:27] how to maximize I my Bitcoin stack in in
[16:31] some way shape or form and my view is
[16:34] not oh I want to make a quick Buck I
[16:36] want to make as uh and make the bug as
[16:40] big as possible but long term like I
[16:43] want to build something big uh and
[16:46] that's the the Mind shift uh for me I
[16:49] cannot say 100% it's because of Bitcoin
[16:52] but it has 100% uh something to do with
[16:55] it uh because I'm young and I'm
[16:57] developing and got also a lot of
[17:00] experience in other areas which are not
[17:02] contributed to bitcoin um but was also
[17:05] interesting and you touched on a little
[17:06] bit with Bitcoin only companies I am in
[17:08] contact with a lot of companies and of
[17:10] course Bitcoin only companies are
[17:13] purchasing for the balance sheets
[17:16] Bitcoin uh and uh even that alone will
[17:20] catapult those companies on a higher
[17:23] level like in a way higher level long
[17:25] term because they will buy Bitcoin
[17:28] Bitcoin will be more worth their balance
[17:30] sheet will be more worth they can have
[17:32] more Capital to deploy and uh have more
[17:35] projects so this this will be this this
[17:38] Snowball Effect of Bitcoin adoption um
[17:42] we are now at the stage where the
[17:44] snowball is really small and we're just
[17:46] coming closer where the snowball slowly
[17:49] gets gets running and uh this this this
[17:52] exponential curve what we will see the
[17:54] next 10 years will be dramatically uh
[17:58] faster and and more offensive and
[18:01] aggressive than most people think I
[18:03] think uh but that's just uh that's just
[18:06] my my opinion here um you will also
[18:08] speak and you probably teased a lot of
[18:10] it right now you will also speak at an
[18:13] event uh soon uh I think this podcast
[18:16] will come out when you already spoke at
[18:18] that event uh probably yeah yeah um what
[18:23] will you speak about you Bitcoin and
[18:25] property management or what yeah
[18:29] absolutely yeah kind kind of uh I I um
[18:33] well so it's the Institute of Real
[18:36] Estate Management um it's a worldwide
[18:40] organization uh that I am a member of uh
[18:44] uh in my
[18:46] position um I'm a certified property
[18:49] manager uh through them um and it uh the
[18:55] webinar will be yeah Bas basically
[18:59] hopefully uh well attended um and I'll
[19:03] be speaking to others in the property
[19:04] management field and hopefully some
[19:07] owners out there uh to discuss how they
[19:12] need to or should be considering
[19:15] bringing Bitcoin onto their balance
[19:17] sheets um and you know kind of going
[19:21] through the process almost similar to
[19:24] how I am currently um you know I haven't
[19:27] I have not yet managed to get all of my
[19:30] residents uh personally paying their
[19:33] rent in Bitcoin um and I'll speak to
[19:38] kind of the incentive structure that
[19:39] I've got set up uh for that to hopefully
[19:43] um encourage people to pay that way um
[19:47] but yeah on on April 18th I'll be uh
[19:52] speaking at a live on their live webinar
[19:56] um and then uh yeah it'll it'll be
[19:59] recorded for later viewing as well
[20:02] amazing what incentive structure if you
[20:05] if you can talk about that uh are you
[20:07] planning is like a discount in Bitcoin
[20:10] or some some yeah absolutely so I'm I'm
[20:15] kind of crazy um and I actually I I've
[20:20] um just thinking about Bitcoin and
[20:22] thinking about the future of Bitcoin and
[20:25] where it's going um you know one of my
[20:27] worries and again I I listened to a lot
[20:30] of Jeff Boo's talks and so I think you
[20:33] know and read his book um and I I think
[20:36] the idea kind of stemmed from some of
[20:39] his talks in
[20:41] particular um
[20:43] where bit uh Bitcoin has to stay
[20:47] decentralized right and and secure and
[20:50] as long as that happens then I don't
[20:54] know that there is any stopping Bitcoin
[20:57] I mean it is just going to continue to
[21:00] grow and con continue to uh consume all
[21:05] of the uh store of value around the
[21:09] world um but when I was thinking about
[21:12] that it you know it was back in I don't
[21:15] know August September October of last
[21:18] year um and one of the things I was
[21:21] thinking about was and I was hearing a
[21:24] lot about from bitcoiners was oh you got
[21:26] to just stack as much as you can stack
[21:28] stack stack stack never sell you know
[21:31] everybody was just hodling forever um
[21:34] and that got me worried a little bit
[21:36] about this whole idea of
[21:38] decentralization and getting
[21:42] Bitcoin into the most hands we possibly
[21:46] can and so you know I I haven't talked
[21:50] to a whole lot of people about this idea
[21:53] this concept yet um but hopefully it'll
[21:56] start to catch on a little bit um but
[21:59] you know when I'm again looking at
[22:01] business models and how people set up
[22:04] businesses and offer you know a lot of a
[22:07] lot of the companies that I was hearing
[22:09] Bitcoin companies were you know they
[22:11] were offering a discount if you paid in
[22:14] a a Fiat discount if you paid in Bitcoin
[22:17] right so if their program or their
[22:21] whatever their their hat was 20 bucks if
[22:24] you paid in paid in Bitcoin you got it
[22:26] for 18 bucks um or you know the other
[22:30] way to look at that was they're
[22:31] upcharging for Fiat right so if your
[22:34] Hat's 20 20 bucks in
[22:37] Bitcoin uh it's 22 bucks if you're going
[22:40] to pay me in in Fiat
[22:42] terms um and that struck me as a
[22:48] incentive model that's based on Fiat
[22:51] business models and it doesn't it
[22:55] doesn't to me do enough to incentivate
[22:59] people to pay with
[23:01] Bitcoin um and so I thought about it and
[23:07] what I offer my residents now is if they
[23:12] pay me in Bitcoin I and this is another
[23:17] business kind of a business idea I have
[23:19] on top of that is developing an app to
[23:21] automate this and make it trustless um
[23:25] but for right now they're paying me in
[23:27] Bitcoin uh um I lock that Bitcoin up for
[23:31] them and give them uh a 5050 split of
[23:35] price
[23:36] appreciation of that paid Bitcoin for up
[23:40] to six months after they pay it to me um
[23:44] and so you know for for me like I said
[23:49] one of my residen is is paying me in
[23:51] Bitcoin right now and let's just say
[23:53] their rent is 1,000 bucks a month they
[23:56] paid me back in November $1,000 or
[23:59] approximately you know that that Bitcoin
[24:01] today is valued at almost $2,000 or
[24:04] right around $2,000 so at any point
[24:08] during this six-month period they can
[24:10] come to me and say Hey I want to lock in
[24:13] that price
[24:14] appreciation and so if they called me up
[24:17] today it would be about you know $1,000
[24:21] of total appreciation of that Bitcoin
[24:24] they paid 50% of that is theirs so
[24:27] they're going to get a 50% or $500 rent
[24:30] credit from me or in in an app world it
[24:34] would just be a return of the Bitcoin
[24:37] and so I've actually I've reached out to
[24:40] uh I I guess I don't want to probably
[24:43] shouldn't be name dropping people but I
[24:46] I'm trying to reach out to some people
[24:49] in the the app development world to try
[24:52] and um work with some people on the oh
[24:58] go CTV I think is is uh a another layer
[25:04] of Bitcoin
[25:07] um oh and yeah I I should have taken
[25:10] some better notes as well be before this
[25:13] uh podcast here sorry um but it is to
[25:18] see if we can develop an app that will
[25:20] automate this process and and really lot
[25:24] basically enter into a smart contract
[25:26] with every resident as they pay over an
[25:30] app uh they can then look at that app
[25:33] anytime they want during the time period
[25:35] that we agree upon when they when we
[25:38] transact and verify that the Bitcoin is
[25:42] there and then at any time they want at
[25:46] on their time frame they can hit a
[25:48] button to basically get a refund or
[25:52] return of a portion of that Bitcoin that
[25:56] they paid equal to whatever percentage
[25:59] of the price appreciation is so I don't
[26:03] know if I'm doing a good job explaining
[26:05] that but I think it's an really
[26:07] interesting idea especially for uh the
[26:11] ones paying like they're paying the
[26:13] price they would have paid anyways uh
[26:16] and they have the chance to basically
[26:18] make the thing back if if Bitcoin all of
[26:20] the sudden has a high price appreciation
[26:23] in in that six months I mean doubling in
[26:26] six months it would be like in a Market
[26:29] but still there's the chance to do that
[26:32] um what what what what I'm asking myself
[26:36] now is what are you getting out of that
[26:39] because you could also just like take
[26:41] the Fiat money and turn it into Bitcoin
[26:43] and look like the full 100% of
[26:47] appreciation is this is this just an
[26:49] emission driven stuff uh where you want
[26:52] to orange pill people or is there
[26:54] anything I don't than yep no it is it is
[26:57] simply
[26:58] to try and create more users on the
[27:02] network so it I mean so that is selfish
[27:04] I mean I I want to see the value of the
[27:07] Bitcoin that I have stacked go up and
[27:10] the only way that I can help that is by
[27:14] driving more people to use Bitcoin and
[27:17] to learn about Bitcoin and you know in
[27:20] this instance if if my resident now you
[27:24] know next month can pay only $500 for
[27:27] their rent hopefully they are going to
[27:30] use that $500 in savings to buy Bitcoin
[27:36] and stack it themselves and benefit that
[27:39] way I I mean you know they may use it
[27:41] for other bills as well whatever the
[27:43] Fiat Fiat bills that they have but my
[27:47] hope would be that they see the value of
[27:51] buying Bitcoin and even you know one
[27:56] even once their rent is so much lower
[27:59] and they're saving that Fiat
[28:02] value they will see the benefit of just
[28:05] buying the Bitcoin themselves and then
[28:08] they will get to enjoy that for the
[28:10] future you know or you know eventually
[28:12] they there may be months that they don't
[28:14] pay me anything because of the Val The
[28:17] increased value or the increased price
[28:20] of Bitcoin um and in those
[28:24] instances you know again if they can
[28:27] stack fors elves that that money that
[28:29] they're saving I'm I'm making that their
[28:32] housing is becoming more affordable and
[28:36] the value of the Bitcoin that I hold is
[28:39] go continuing to go up so it just it
[28:42] seems to me like it is a win-win
[28:45] situation and um yeah I I like to I mean
[28:51] I I certainly again it's it's that
[28:54] getting out of that Fiat mindset I think
[28:56] and that going getting into the Bitcoin
[28:58] mindset of running if the world is
[29:01] running on
[29:02] bitcoin there isn't a need for me to
[29:07] collect as much Fiat as I can from
[29:09] people and stack it into Bitcoin there
[29:12] is more of a need and I think it's more
[29:15] important that more people are learning
[29:17] about Bitcoin and how they can benefit
[29:20] from it
[29:23] and this seems like a better incentive
[29:26] to me than just giving you know giving
[29:27] them a 10% discount on their rent if
[29:29] they pay me in Bitcoin that that's a
[29:32] one-time thing or something and it it
[29:36] doesn't teach them really about the
[29:39] benefits amazing I think I think when
[29:41] when this is up and running in live and
[29:43] you have some like first half year or
[29:45] year data we definitely have to have you
[29:48] back on the podcast and report from from
[29:50] all those amazing datas what you you
[29:53] yeah absolutely I'd be happy happy to
[29:56] come back on and and talk about it for
[29:58] sure I think you this month before the
[30:01] end of this month they um you know this
[30:04] is their six-month period And so at
[30:06] least one of those residents will be uh
[30:09] will be recognizing some of that value
[30:13] so uh that's that's really cool how do
[30:16] you see actually the the whole real
[30:17] estate market uh when you look on a
[30:20] broader scale uh developing on a Bitcoin
[30:22] standard like when we imagine this
[30:24] future where there's a Bitcoin standard
[30:26] how do you see the property Market
[30:27] market and the real estate
[30:29] market yeah so uh good question I uh I I
[30:35] I see things going one of two ways um
[30:38] you know I I can see a giant market
[30:42] crash and chaos and lots of people
[30:47] getting wiped out and and uh the world
[30:50] kind of falling into a a chaotic
[30:54] recession Global recession so to speak
[30:56] for you know number of years um maybe
[31:01] permanently um as we transition onto a
[31:05] Bitcoin standard or I I
[31:09] hopefully and and this is the the world
[31:12] that I want to see is we transition to a
[31:15] Bitcoin standard in a more um steady
[31:19] kind of exponential growth rate um that
[31:25] that allows us to do this uh Dem
[31:27] monetizing the the real estate store of
[31:31] value um all other Global assets and
[31:34] commodities in a in a
[31:37] more um predictable manner so that
[31:41] people don't just get completely wiped
[31:43] out right away um and that's again that
[31:48] that's kind of where I was going with
[31:50] this incentive model too you know this
[31:52] idea of
[31:54] driving driving more people to bitcoin
[31:58] through through this this different
[32:01] incentive model um I I I think you know
[32:07] if I was a resident living somewhere I
[32:09] would look I I own my house not
[32:12] completely so I'm still making payments
[32:13] to my bank um but I would love it if
[32:18] like my bank would do the exact same
[32:20] thing for me that I'm doing for my
[32:22] residents and all they would have to do
[32:24] is say hey let's do it pay me in Bitcoin
[32:27] and and you know for for me as a
[32:29] business owner I I have to manage my
[32:32] Fiat cash in order to pay the bank back
[32:36] for my apartment building um just like I
[32:40] have to as a as a person for my
[32:43] household right I I my bank loan is in
[32:46] Fiat in is in valued in US dollar
[32:50] terms and so as long as I can manage
[32:54] that cash
[32:56] flow um
[32:58] I I don't see why we can't do this make
[33:02] this transition to bitcoin only in a
[33:06] much more methodical fashion that
[33:11] doesn't burn the entire economy to the
[33:14] ground and just flip everybody out and
[33:18] you know go launch us into
[33:20] chaos um and and that's what needs to
[33:24] happen and other business owners need to
[33:26] take that mindset I think and and really
[33:30] try and work towards that you know like
[33:32] I said at the beginning my my building
[33:34] is now valued at eight Bitcoin right
[33:38] that's going to continue to to drop as I
[33:41] continue to stack Bitcoin eventually at
[33:45] some point I
[33:48] will have collected enough Bitcoin from
[33:52] my residence that offsets the value of
[33:55] my building in Bitcoin terms and I no
[33:58] longer have any reason to sell that
[34:01] building in the future right I have I
[34:04] have no reason to try and get at that US
[34:08] dollar value just to go buy Bitcoin with
[34:11] it when when I can build this business
[34:14] that is going to continue to collect
[34:16] Bitcoin into
[34:19] perpetuity so I and I I think that
[34:24] that more more owners more business
[34:27] owners need to take that perspective and
[34:29] look at the
[34:31] long-term the long-term value of
[34:34] whatever business they're they're
[34:35] providing whatever value they're
[34:37] providing to people so 21 Bitcoin is
[34:40] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[34:43] and preach self- custody this is my goto
[34:47] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[34:49] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[34:52] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[34:55] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[34:57] I'm support this podcast use code Robin
[35:00] and click the link in the description
[35:02] you want everybody to switch to a new
[35:04] system like it's with a syncing ship
[35:07] like if the Titanic is sinking you want
[35:10] it to syn in a slow and steady manner so
[35:13] people can get on the live boats uh and
[35:16] if it sinks too fast uh too many people
[35:19] drown and this could happen and we can
[35:22] say oh have fun staying poor and uh
[35:25] sorry you did not get the message uh but
[35:28] we can also help them in a better way
[35:30] and I'm I'm I'm I'm a fan of the letter
[35:33] one where we are helping people and
[35:36] orange pilling people and saying hey
[35:37] this is the way we this is the future I
[35:40] don't orange peill you to get my Bitcoin
[35:42] up in value because this is nonsense
[35:45] that I can move the Bitcoin price I am I
[35:48] want to help you uh and this is I think
[35:52] that the way we we have to look at
[35:54] it y absolutely and
[35:58] uh for me then also the question
[36:00] especially when we talk about real
[36:01] estate and the housing market um do you
[36:04] see Bitcoin solving homelessness in the
[36:08] long run if the all the prices are
[36:11] falling to utility
[36:14] value
[36:16] uh I I don't you know I think there are
[36:20] always going to be people that uh are
[36:24] choosing to opt out of any
[36:28] system um and I think Bitcoin is just
[36:32] another system all all be all be it a
[36:36] you know much more perfect system than
[36:38] any we have had
[36:39] previously um I I I think there will
[36:43] still be a certain subset of people that
[36:46] just aren't interested in that
[36:50] um maybe I'm wrong you know I I would
[36:54] like to think I'm I'm wrong but um I
[36:58] definitely I definitely think it makes
[37:02] housing much more affordable in the
[37:04] future um I like you said Bitcoin is
[37:09] going to
[37:11] demonetize um the the store of value
[37:15] that we've held in the real estate world
[37:18] and and everything um and as those
[37:23] products fall to the the you know the
[37:27] the
[37:28] utility value yeah yep
[37:31] um the people that I I like to think the
[37:35] people that are in a position like I
[37:38] hope to be are going to be you know I'm
[37:41] I'm I'm going to be able to continue my
[37:44] business going forward because again I'm
[37:48] saving my cash reserves my my rent
[37:51] payments in Bitcoin terms for th those
[37:54] properties at this point so I'm I'm
[37:57] already demonetizing the Fiat value of
[38:00] those properties now at at some point I
[38:03] might get sick of it and be like I'm
[38:05] done I don't want to deal with you know
[38:07] renters anymore whatever the case is but
[38:11] um you know I I have no no desire at
[38:14] this time to sell those
[38:16] buildings um and and just get out of it
[38:20] and turn that um money into Bitcoin I I
[38:24] think the future is much brighter if if
[38:27] I stay in business and and I provide
[38:31] value to people that are willing
[38:34] to uh provide me value in return yeah
[38:39] it's amazing by the way we mentioned
[38:40] Jeff boof uh before once or twice
[38:43] there's like I made a episode with Jeff
[38:45] PO for people that don't know him or are
[38:49] curious about him he is one of the
[38:52] Bitcoin uh priests that I'm like you
[38:54] have to at least watch one video of him
[38:56] so if you time watch the Jeff Bo one if
[38:59] you haven't done already uh just just
[39:02] wanted to to get this message out um I'm
[39:05] curious how like I I'm always talking
[39:09] about how Bitcoin changes the few on
[39:11] other stuff but I'm curious how did uh
[39:15] you owning apartments and you being in
[39:18] the property Market change your view on
[39:21] bitcoin that you see it's might be a
[39:23] little different to my view or to views
[39:26] of other bitcoiners
[39:30] um so uh well you know I guess I'm I'm
[39:35] in a unique position in the Property
[39:39] Management Field I've so I've been doing
[39:41] this now for gosh 26 years um I'm a
[39:47] little older than you are uh I I'll be
[39:50] 48 this year um and you know I have been
[39:56] in the so the last 177 years I've been
[39:59] in the affordable
[40:01] housing uh industry um and prior to that
[40:06] I was in the market rate Housing
[40:08] Industry and you know I think coming to
[40:12] the affordable housing side of things um
[40:17] changed at least at the company that I I
[40:20] came to um I was able to kind of change
[40:24] my view
[40:25] from um trying to figure out how to
[40:29] increase the
[40:31] rents uh as much as
[40:34] possible to maximize the return to the
[40:37] investors of the properties in the
[40:39] market rate world to
[40:42] really the rents being out of my control
[40:46] in the affordable housing industry and
[40:48] they're kind of set by the government
[40:51] agencies that that help to pay the rent
[40:54] for people and specifically I'm in the
[40:57] uh
[40:57] Project based Section 8 housing World
[41:00] currently um and so you know the the the
[41:03] government basically does
[41:07] um uh studies to determine what the
[41:11] market rate rents should be for all of
[41:15] our properties at this time and kind of
[41:17] says this is what you get to charge
[41:19] people for your rent um it's still high
[41:22] and and it still wasn't doing enough to
[41:26] you know I didn't see enough of my
[41:27] residents being able to get good jobs
[41:32] and get out on their own and and get
[41:34] into the market rate world and so that
[41:38] always kind of stuck in the back of my
[41:40] head um that we need to figure out some
[41:44] way to to
[41:46] help more people um not just by giving
[41:51] them subsidies or reduced rent
[41:53] necessarily but by encouraging them to
[41:56] to work and to be able to pay their own
[41:58] rent or to to save some money um and
[42:03] Bitcoin when when you know once I
[42:06] started digging into it it just kind of
[42:08] seemed like a a no-brainer to me that
[42:11] there's got to be a way I can convince
[42:14] my residents to either start saving in
[42:18] Bitcoin um so that they can get out of
[42:21] the you know the the positions that
[42:23] they're in or
[42:27] like I came up with you know this
[42:29] incentive structure idea to to help make
[42:34] their rent even more affordable which
[42:36] hopefully will help allow them to um you
[42:40] know better save some more money and you
[42:43] know buy a house at some point in time
[42:46] as as home values come down or whatever
[42:49] the case is so amazing this brings me I
[42:53] think that yeah this also brings me to a
[42:56] topic which I not had on the radar today
[42:58] but it's it's interesting to to go in
[43:00] because you said there and it's also in
[43:03] Austria there's like a lot of different
[43:05] places where um the government sets a
[43:09] limit for the price uh or Price
[43:12] completely uh and there are a lot of
[43:15] those ideas which are definitely not a
[43:18] free market idea uh and uh I had a lot
[43:22] of people on that said like Bitcoin
[43:24] enforce this kind of a free market it's
[43:26] it's like
[43:27] it it it forces uh governments to have a
[43:30] free market how do you see the whole
[43:33] topic with free market Bitcoin free
[43:35] market on a Bitcoin standard because
[43:37] also like people say oh capitalism is so
[43:40] bad but we we are not living in a
[43:42] capitalism if if the capital is
[43:44] controlled by Central Bank for me that's
[43:47] kind
[43:48] of it's kind of it's not possible to
[43:51] live in a capitalist Society if if the
[43:53] capitalist controlled by a centralized
[43:55] organization it's like the first thing
[43:57] not not checking the Box um how do you
[43:59] see the the future with free market and
[44:01] Bitcoin and and like the Bitcoin
[44:05] standard yeah I I think it looks a lot
[44:07] different than it looks right now um you
[44:10] know I I do have my concerns with the
[44:14] consolidation of Bitcoin uh lots of
[44:19] Bitcoin into the hands of a view and I
[44:22] could see us us uh going
[44:27] down a path that is similar to the one
[44:29] that we've been going with in the Fiat
[44:31] World um and again that that's
[44:36] concerning to me I I really think that
[44:39] we need to have Bitcoin in the hands of
[44:41] as many people as possible um and you
[44:46] know I I My Hope Is that we will get
[44:49] there my my desire is that we will get
[44:53] there um I I just C certainly am am a
[44:58] bit concerned about that um you know and
[45:01] and what what does that look like right
[45:03] um you know Michael sailor with his
[45:06] 20,000 Bitcoin or whatever that number
[45:08] happens to be you know he's he's set to
[45:12] be potentially the wealthiest person on
[45:15] the planet uh if Bitcoin does what we
[45:18] all believe it's going to do
[45:21] and he has to do some good with that you
[45:24] know if he's just sitting on it and then
[45:26] becomes the bank that everybody has to
[45:28] go to or the the person that everybody
[45:31] you know that owns all the property
[45:34] across the the us or
[45:37] wherever um I I I'm not sure that that
[45:42] gets us out
[45:44] of the systems that we're
[45:48] in I just want to quickly jump in here
[45:50] uh because I also see that as a danger
[45:54] but really important to note here I only
[45:57] see it as a medium term uh danger
[46:00] because long term we have a proof of
[46:02] work system where you everybody has to
[46:05] work for that money like even the one
[46:07] that has a lot of money cannot make more
[46:10] money with just that money he can invest
[46:12] in business and stuff like that but then
[46:14] he's a clever businessman and then he
[46:16] would have accumulate more money anyways
[46:18] H and when he invests in Bad Business he
[46:21] will lose his Bitcoin stack and the
[46:22] Bitcoin stack will come will get smaller
[46:25] and smaller so that's the it's a really
[46:27] big difference because if in the Fiat
[46:29] world if you have a lot of money banks
[46:32] will beg you to get give you credit
[46:35] which you can then reinvest and stuff
[46:37] like that and basic a lot of feed money
[46:39] will make you more feed money as proof
[46:41] of stake is like if you have a lot of
[46:43] ethereum you can have more ethereum
[46:46] because you can STI it and stuff like
[46:47] that that's completely
[46:49] centralization mindset and there this
[46:52] feared mindset and Bitcoin is the only
[46:54] thing and I agree with the media term
[46:57] thing but I don't agree on on the on the
[46:59] long-term view because everybody even
[47:01] Michael sailor and he does a lot of hard
[47:04] work for that and he takes a lot of risk
[47:07] on for for that also
[47:09] um it it's the proof of work and the
[47:12] risk is needed to get to bitcoin and
[47:16] being early is an advantage but it's
[47:18] only an advantage till you fail and also
[47:22] those people will probably die at some
[47:24] point uh and uh there's a lot of like
[47:28] the redistribution of Bitcoin is natural
[47:31] and I actually never covered that topic
[47:33] in my my podcast I just discovered in my
[47:36] head if and you're my 90 91st podcast
[47:40] guest uh so all right I'm coming closer
[47:43] to the 100 and this is something I wrote
[47:48] sometimes in early my Twitter career
[47:50] where I and this was one of my first
[47:52] three four really um good performing
[47:56] tweets
[47:57] and uh this is what a lot of people
[48:00] don't understand when they come in
[48:02] Bitcoin they're like oh there's this big
[48:04] hodlers and they have so much money they
[48:07] will we can never catch up yes medium
[48:10] term they have a lot of power but the
[48:13] longer down the road uh and and this is
[48:16] we are switching a system basically if
[48:18] it's the same thing on the internet like
[48:20] people that invested a lot in Facebook
[48:23] Apple Amazon Microsoft and everything
[48:25] they are on top like make so much money
[48:28] you never have to work again but just
[48:31] investing early in in some things uh but
[48:34] yeah we that's switching in the system
[48:36] is always makes a few really rich uh and
[48:40] uh we have to look at the prodct scale
[48:42] but sorry I did not want to interrupt
[48:43] you I just was like I have to yeah no no
[48:47] you're that's a very good point and I I
[48:49] I hope I wasn't coming across as a a
[48:52] Michael sailor hater or you know like
[48:54] he's an evil guy because I I have mad
[48:57] respect for the guy and I think I think
[49:00] he is doing a a lot for the space and a
[49:03] lot he's worked as butt off he is a
[49:06] super smart guy from everything I've
[49:08] heard I've never you know met him in
[49:10] person maybe someday um but and and you
[49:14] are absolutely right in the the
[49:16] redistribution part of it as well um
[49:19] that that's going to happen no doubt in
[49:22] my mind um people that are um doing
[49:29] things for the wrong reasons are going
[49:32] to you know find themselves wrecked
[49:35] people that are doing things
[49:37] for um shortterm gain are you know
[49:42] that's that goes against everything that
[49:44] the the Bitcoin World kind of stands for
[49:48] right and so I I do believe that that in
[49:51] the end that does get
[49:54] redistributed um and even eventually we
[49:57] end up
[49:59] with uh and I'm sure there's some
[50:02] somebody out there that is uh Math
[50:04] Genius or that knows that there's some
[50:07] theorem out there that you know shows
[50:10] how things will distribute over time I I
[50:13] guess I kind of look at it like what
[50:16] what is it uh energy in the second law
[50:20] of Thermodynamics where um I think
[50:23] that's where everything will equally
[50:26] distribute over time um all the heat
[50:28] will kind of uh dissipate out of the
[50:31] universe over time or something like
[50:33] that you know bit
[50:35] Bitcoin would will be follow that path I
[50:40] think um and it it will get harder and
[50:43] harder to accumulate and keep uh or
[50:48] maintain a stack that is larger than
[50:52] anybody else is going forward you know
[50:54] that's that's eons away probably um but
[51:01] um yeah o over time I I do believe that
[51:04] that happened so I mean it's going to it
[51:07] it's almost like this thing is is a law
[51:11] of physics or or is a you know it yeah
[51:16] it it should have its own law and I I
[51:19] know there's somebody out there on in
[51:21] Twitter land or xland that says it's a
[51:23] power law or something like that um you
[51:26] know there's maybe maybe some um some
[51:31] valid points there but again over over
[51:35] time I think it acts more um where where
[51:38] it just dissipates and becomes more
[51:41] evenly spread across the entire
[51:43] population so 100% And by the way for
[51:47] people that want to check out the power
[51:49] I also has episode with with javanni
[51:52] from the guy did you okay all right it's
[51:55] my longest podcast ever
[51:57] uh and I
[51:59] have I don't know if this Fe like I'm I
[52:03] I did not understand the power itself
[52:05] 100% uh and for me it's always
[52:08] interesting and funny how people come up
[52:10] with different models and put it on
[52:12] bitcoin and then they break again uh
[52:16] maybe it's the one model that does not
[52:17] break let's see uh I I don't want to
[52:20] judge it because I clearly did not do
[52:23] enough research to do that even though I
[52:25] had the guy on like I I did like 10 15
[52:29] 20 hours of research really deep in the
[52:31] topic uh just of on the topic of power
[52:34] law but um if you really want to trust
[52:37] something you really have to do the Deep
[52:39] research and yeah encourage people to
[52:41] just just check it out it was even like
[52:43] one of my most watched episodes uh I
[52:46] think on in the top six seven episodes
[52:49] or something like that uh so people
[52:51] definitely resonate with that and people
[52:53] definitely find it interesting uh but
[52:56] I'm like yeah it's it's it's something
[52:59] yeah it's it's it's another way to
[53:01] bitcoin do another one and this poo and
[53:03] the chani definitely orange build
[53:05] someone else and it brings you another
[53:08] group of pip Corners in that's the goal
[53:11] right so he does nothing
[53:13] absolutely um and the last thing I want
[53:16] to get into before we get to the end
[53:18] routine uh you have in your Twitter bio
[53:22] or X bio uh the sentence Bitcoin reminds
[53:26] you of the
[53:27] Highlander uh how do how do you mean
[53:31] that some somebody actually just
[53:33] commented on uh on my profile something
[53:37] um uh about having just watched the
[53:40] Highlander um for their first time so I
[53:43] don't um you know I just in the fact
[53:46] that there can be only one you there's I
[53:48] I think Bitcoin is going to prove to
[53:51] humanity that there is only one way to
[53:54] communicate value amongst
[53:57] ourselves um and and I think that is
[54:01] going to be based on bitcoin um at least
[54:05] at this point in time you know who's to
[54:06] say that there's not another Discovery
[54:09] somewhere down the road in a couple
[54:10] hundred years or a couple thousand years
[54:12] that that ends up being even better than
[54:15] Bitcoin um I have no idea what the
[54:18] future is going to look like um or or be
[54:22] for sure um but yeah that that that's
[54:28] that's where I was going with that bit
[54:30] Bitcoin will be the only really the only
[54:33] way to communicate value other than you
[54:35] know hey I'll watch your kid for the
[54:37] night you watch my kid or I'll wash your
[54:40] car you wash my car next week or you
[54:43] know I'll I'll shovel your sidewalk
[54:45] while you're gone on vacation this week
[54:47] you shovel mine next week kind of a
[54:48] thing um the old the old barter system
[54:52] um but other than that you know I I do
[54:56] believe
[54:57] Bitcoin Bitcoin is is just it's slowly
[55:02] taking over everything and and um it it
[55:07] will be the only one definitely I'm I'm
[55:10] 100 pering agreeing with that obviously
[55:13] with my podcast um we're coming to the
[55:17] to the end routine of the podcast where
[55:19] the previous guest is asking a question
[55:21] for the next guest kind of this
[55:22] blockchain kind of thing where the um
[55:26] guest are connected to each other
[55:27] without even being really connected to
[55:29] each other um what's your and the
[55:32] question for you is what's your take on
[55:34] ordinals and
[55:38] inscriptions
[55:39] um look I'm I'm I'm not into it um I I
[55:46] have a feeling some of that is probably
[55:48] still PTSD from the whole nft craze from
[55:51] the 2020 my 2020 kind of entry into
[55:55] Bitcoin um I I do
[55:59] think um anything that drives usage um
[56:04] and uh awareness to
[56:08] bitcoin um is a benefit to bitcoin um
[56:14] you know in the long run I don't think
[56:16] that it's going to be a worthwh I think
[56:21] we look back on on it and go huh that
[56:24] was kind of crazy how that popped off
[56:27] like that and I'm glad that you know we
[56:30] don't have a bunch of ordinals running
[56:32] around on on the Bitcoin blockchain
[56:37] um yeah that I'll I'll leave it at that
[56:40] I I don't I don't really know enough
[56:42] about it to make any more of a comment
[56:45] other than what I've said really really
[56:48] cool perfect then uh I'm I enjoyed our
[56:51] our speak today uh really really cool
[56:53] that uh you you joined me today uh is
[56:56] there anything you want to add today
[56:58] where can people reach out to you what
[57:00] do you w to say in L end um yeah I guess
[57:06] uh you know on on on X for now I still
[57:10] have my profile there I am also on nter
[57:13] you can just search my name um I'm out
[57:18] there on LinkedIn all all kind of this
