[00:00] 2030 will be a big milestone between the
[00:03] 2028 cycle and the 2032 cycle when we
[00:07] will potentially go from 1 million to 5
[00:10] million Bitcoin that's done 15x Tesla
[00:12] that's done about 15x and micro strategy
[00:15] fully focused on bitcoin per share
[00:17] increase over time they've done 30X you
[00:19] need to be laser eyes focused either as
[00:22] an individual or as a company on the
[00:25] accumulation of Bitcoin you have Bitcoin
[00:27] at 60% annualized returns over four
[00:31] years you have magnificant 7 at 30% you
[00:34] have the S&P at 15% and then you go down
[00:37] like real estate 8% gold and so on until
[00:41] zero and even negative effective rates
[00:43] it is quite impossible for any company
[00:46] to outperform every year Bitcoin meaning
[00:49] to generate 60% plus return and risk
[00:53] adjusted compared with Bitcoin where you
[00:55] don't have any risk of execution even if
[00:58] a company does plus 50 % this is nothing
[01:01] in Bitcoin terms if you do plus 15% but
[01:03] you don't accumulate Bitcoin well it
[01:05] just going to zero Bitcoin is at the
[01:07] center of capital markets it is the
[01:10] standard store of value and it has
[01:12] infiltrated all financial instruments in
[01:15] about 8 to 10 years this will completely
[01:18] reprice the financial world it's not a
[01:20] matter of if but when at this
[01:22] [Music]
[01:26] point what are you doing and why are you
[01:29] into Bitcoin sure so I'm Alex and Le I'm
[01:32] Deputy CEO and director of Bitcoin
[01:34] strategy at the blockchain group uh and
[01:37] previously I was digital assets lead at
[01:40] Accenture where I was leading the team
[01:42] for digital assets notably in France and
[01:45] Benelux and over the world as well
[01:48] leading the public blockchain offering
[01:51] strategy uh for financial institutions
[01:53] so over this experience and the past one
[01:56] as well at ey where I worked with a lot
[01:59] of multin corporations and treasurers
[02:02] I've been working with 30 plus financial
[02:04] institutions and half of the 40 biggest
[02:08] corporate treasuries in France so that's
[02:12] also what led me to bitcoin because um I
[02:15] was working with these corporate
[02:17] treasurers back in 2020 in the middle of
[02:20] like negative interest rates uh context
[02:24] where I was seeing billions and billions
[02:27] of shareholder value being ever at let's
[02:30] say uh in Money Market funds and so on
[02:34] and at the same time you had micro
[02:36] strategy launching the Bitcoin strategy
[02:38] and stting to go through the roof so uh
[02:41] Bitcoin uh I'm Bitcoin class 2020 let's
[02:45] say um and so I've gone down the rabbit
[02:48] hole as everybody in the Bitcoin space
[02:51] and uh then I discovered that the best
[02:54] opportunity uh was to um work on a
[02:57] Bitcoin treasury company and develop one
[03:00] so when I was digital assets lead at ex
[03:02] centure I I I was contacted by the
[03:05] blockchain group to implement and launch
[03:08] a Bitcoin treasury strategy uh so of
[03:11] course I said yes a Bitcoin treasury uh
[03:14] for their own company exactly so the
[03:18] blockchain group is the first Bitcoin
[03:20] treasury company uh in France and Europe
[03:24] fully focused on the treasury side on
[03:27] improving Bitcoin per share over time so
[03:31] that's the full focus of this Bitcoin
[03:33] treasury company strategy and the
[03:36] company is listed on Euro next growth
[03:39] Paris uh where it trades um in in in the
[03:43] public market so it's the first publicly
[03:46] traded company in France to adopt this
[03:49] Bitcoin treasury company strategy like
[03:51] the micro strategy Playbook fully
[03:54] focused on raising Capital accumulating
[03:57] Bitcoin on the balance sheet holding it
[04:00] with no intention to sell and so the
[04:03] objective is of course to raise as much
[04:05] Capital as possible to buy as much
[04:07] Bitcoin as possible because we believe
[04:09] it's the best of value so yeah
[04:12] interesting and the blockchain group
[04:15] what are you doing yes so the blockchain
[04:17] group uh basically and the name comes
[04:20] from an activity that they had before it
[04:24] was they had a subsidiary specialized in
[04:26] web free wallets that activity failed
[04:29] basically didn't survey the last bare
[04:31] market so that's also part of the
[04:34] reasons why I joined as a Bitcoin
[04:36] maximalist uh the blockchain group was
[04:39] because now uh after liquidating this
[04:41] subsidiary the blockchain group has two
[04:44] operating companies uh one dedicated to
[04:47] data intelligence and AI consulting
[04:49] services and another one dedicated to uh
[04:52] development specific development
[04:54] tailored for web applications uh and
[04:57] also a part of the activity in
[04:59] blockchain development uh when there is
[05:01] a business use case and client demand uh
[05:04] but then of course um we have these two
[05:06] operating companies and now the Bitcoin
[05:09] treasury strategy uh that we have
[05:12] launched on five November last year
[05:15] interesting so a completely new thing uh
[05:18] but it seems like the blockchain group
[05:21] uh has no operating companies right now
[05:23] in the crypto sphere direct so so what
[05:27] we have is uh we have blockchain
[05:30] developers uh that do provide services
[05:33] for clients that want to develop any
[05:36] type of application that would use any
[05:39] type of uh blockchain Network to do
[05:42] automation or something like that so
[05:44] that uh we we still have but we don't
[05:47] have a specific subsidiary uh as before
[05:51] um that that is dedicated to over
[05:54] activities like that really cool um I
[05:57] love that I think that's a great great
[05:59] space to be in and you mentioned Bitcoin
[06:02] per share we had that like two two times
[06:04] I think already in the podcast uh but I
[06:08] think most people still is that like a
[06:10] little bit of a a foreign concept of
[06:13] like what is bitcoin per share uh and
[06:16] and how will that uh move forward like
[06:19] how will this shape companies how they
[06:21] operate uh moving forward yes so uh this
[06:25] is the new metric that bitcoiners look
[06:28] at when valuating
[06:30] uh especially a public publicly listed
[06:33] company but also private entities uh
[06:36] it's uh when you divide the number of
[06:39] Bitcoin by the number of shares um and
[06:42] so you you see how much you have Bitcoin
[06:44] per share uh and this is the number of
[06:48] um the metric that you look at for
[06:50] valuing the the company and so as much
[06:54] uh this number can go up uh is the value
[06:57] that you can get as well as an investor
[07:00] so as a Bitcoin investor you will want
[07:03] to look at um companies publicly listed
[07:06] companies that are able to accumulate
[07:09] Bitcoin with their excess cash from
[07:11] their operations and that are able to
[07:14] raise Capital uh both equity and debt
[07:18] especially convertible debt uh to
[07:21] increase uh more the number of Bitcoin
[07:24] per share than the delution that you get
[07:27] when you raise equity for example or
[07:29] where you convert the convertible Bond
[07:32] so the increase of Bitcoin per share you
[07:35] see that is something that is published
[07:37] by micro strategy as BTC yield uh it's
[07:42] not really a yield it's like a kpi that
[07:45] is published by the company to say look
[07:47] we have raised that much capital and
[07:50] with this Capital we have acquired this
[07:52] much Bitcoin and so with this much
[07:55] Bitcoin it's been increasing more the
[07:57] number of Bitcoin than it's been
[08:00] diluting the shares so there is an
[08:02] increase in Bitcoin per share uh and the
[08:04] calculation is typically done on a fully
[08:07] diluted basis so you take into account
[08:09] all the shares that will be uh issued
[08:12] over time that that you can know of and
[08:15] you take into account the Bitcoin that
[08:17] you have on the balance sheet and with
[08:18] that you can calculate the BTC per share
[08:21] over time over quarter over year and
[08:24] that's a key metric for investors to see
[08:27] how they uh perform compared with
[08:30] Bitcoin only compared with an ETF and so
[08:34] on so of course a Bitcoin treasury
[08:37] company has many advantages uh one of
[08:40] them is first that there is operational
[08:43] activities that uh you you can leverage
[08:46] to generate excess cash flows uh you can
[08:49] also acquire new companies uh to
[08:51] generate even more cash flows on this
[08:53] front but um the the the key performance
[08:57] indicator for Bitcoin treasury companies
[09:00] is the ability to really focus on
[09:03] bitcoin there is a huge difference
[09:06] between companies that accumulate
[09:08] Bitcoin and companies that are fully
[09:10] focused on increasing Bitcoin per share
[09:13] over time for example Tesla they have
[09:16] Bitcoin on the balance sheet but they
[09:18] are not laser eyes focused on bitcoin
[09:21] per share increase over time and in over
[09:24] five years you have Bitcoin that's done
[09:26] 15x Tesla that's done about 15 X and
[09:30] micro strategy fully focused on bitcoin
[09:33] per share increase over time they've
[09:34] done 30X so of course it's volatile
[09:37] that's numbers from December but even
[09:40] today I think it's like 10x 10x and for
[09:43] micro strategy 20 23x so uh you see that
[09:47] there is huge value in focusing on the
[09:50] treasury side on the Bitcoin per share
[09:53] increase and then with this you can
[09:56] provide investors with a Bitcoin yield
[09:59] as a kpi not specific yield that uh
[10:03] provides more risk to investors because
[10:05] they invest in an operating company that
[10:08] but that potentially can provide more
[10:09] upside as well as they get more Bitcoin
[10:12] per share relatively rather than buy an
[10:15] ETF where they will be just one to one
[10:19] that's interesting um the share
[10:21] outstanding and the looted shares uh
[10:24] maybe you can explain it a little bit
[10:26] for for those uh people that don't know
[10:28] about about um the stock market because
[10:32] I think it's super interesting to to to
[10:34] know where this number actually comes
[10:37] from so you go ahead and there's like
[10:39] shares outstanding how are the the
[10:41] shares actually divided like what is the
[10:44] the metric there and there's also like a
[10:46] lot of stock splits and complex things
[10:48] that come into that account uh but but
[10:51] maybe to to make it a little bit
[10:54] more um understandable what the what the
[10:57] shares part of of of that is yeah sure
[11:01] so imagine that you have 100 Bitcoin on
[11:04] the balance sheet and you have 100
[11:07] shares well you will have one Bitcoin
[11:10] per share you see so if um the company
[11:14] does another raise and it manages to uh
[11:18] accumulate 200 Bitcoin but um the number
[11:23] of shares only increases by 50 you see
[11:27] that there will be more Bitcoin
[11:29] per share uh effectively so that's of
[11:33] course a very rough example but that's
[11:36] the idea around it and then uh and so to
[11:39] give you an example for a company that
[11:41] starts the Bitcoin treasury company
[11:44] strategy it is much easier to increase
[11:47] proportionally the number of
[11:49] Bitcoins than uh the number of
[11:51] outstanding shares imagine you have 1
[11:54] million shares and one Bitcoin uh you
[11:57] can increase the shares by 50% but then
[12:01] the number of Bitcoin might increase by
[12:03] 2x you see so uh that's why then you
[12:06] have an increase of the Bitcoin per
[12:08] share and then in terms of how to
[12:11] calculate the fully diluted it will of
[12:14] course vary depending on the
[12:15] jurisdictions and so on but uh an easy
[12:18] example uh just to understand would be
[12:21] for example that when you have
[12:23] convertible depth if you issue Equity
[12:26] that's increasing directly the number of
[12:28] shares right but if you issue
[12:30] convertible depbt that is a depth
[12:33] instrument that will be potentially
[12:35] under certain conditions converted paid
[12:39] for into shares and so in the
[12:42] calculation you can already take into
[12:45] account those potential shares that will
[12:47] be issued in a future state to take into
[12:50] account the effective um Bitcoin per
[12:53] share taking into account even the
[12:55] future shares that would be uh issued
[12:59] later on interesting and that number is
[13:03] comparable obviously for one company but
[13:05] can you also compare two companies with
[13:08] each other like for example Tesla and
[13:10] micro strategy with that in a good way
[13:12] or is there too many differences there
[13:14] so of course there are a lot of
[13:16] differences because um for a company
[13:19] that is much more advanced in in their
[13:22] Bitcoin treasury strategy it will be
[13:25] theoretically more difficult to increase
[13:28] this number of Bitcoin per share yet
[13:31] even if micro strategy is very Advanced
[13:33] I think they have achieved recently like
[13:35] 90% 97% BTC yield so because they've
[13:40] been able to uh raise a lot of capital
[13:43] during the last months so uh basically
[13:47] you can compare company based on the
[13:49] Bitcoin per share increase uh but there
[13:52] but it's not the only
[13:54] Factor uh there is the number of Bitcoin
[13:56] on the balance sheet there is the number
[13:58] of Bitcoin on the balance sheet compared
[14:00] with the operating business there is the
[14:02] number of Bitcoin increase over time
[14:06] with the number of Bitcoin per share but
[14:08] there is also the multiple of
[14:11] valuation on top of uh the the net asset
[14:15] value that investors attribute to a
[14:17] company even in traditional markets uh
[14:21] investors will value
[14:23] Amazon uh apple and so on based on
[14:26] future potential profits uh that will
[14:29] come so they will put a multiple on the
[14:33] the the revenues and on the
[14:35] profitability of the company and say
[14:38] look uh this company is worth uh 10x
[14:42] their profits and this company is worth
[14:45] 20x their profits or something like that
[14:48] um with Bitcoin it's a bit uh starting
[14:51] as well and you have uh multiples for
[14:54] micro strategy that have oscillated
[14:56] between two and three between the net
[14:59] ass set value of the Bitcoin on the
[15:00] balance sheet and the market cap so
[15:03] you've had these multiples that have
[15:05] been observed and then you you have you
[15:09] have seen for example with metap Planet
[15:11] multiples of 5 to
[15:13] 7x because they've been in their first
[15:15] year and they've uh outperformed very
[15:18] well so uh you see and it will vary
[15:21] depending on the markets as well because
[15:24] in the US uh when you have a high
[15:26] multiple compared with the net asset
[15:29] value the companies are incentivized to
[15:32] do what we call an ATM meaning that they
[15:34] can sell shares directly into the market
[15:38] to take advantage of this
[15:40] multiple buy Bitcoin with the proceeds
[15:45] and then potentially then increase the
[15:47] net asset value and then in the in the
[15:49] future St state where Bitcoin
[15:51] appreciates in value go back to this
[15:55] market cap at the time so that's why
[15:56] Michael seller says with Arbitrage we've
[15:59] captured 500 million of US dollars of
[16:03] value or even more billions so that's
[16:07] something that is very easy in the US
[16:09] that it's a bit more complicated in
[16:11] overall
[16:12] jurisdictions like in Japan because and
[16:15] like in in France as well companies need
[16:18] to um convocate the general assembly and
[16:21] say how much uh shares they will issue
[16:25] and so on and it takes more time uh but
[16:27] at the end of the day it's Al beneficial
[16:30] in other ways because as an adventor you
[16:32] see that you you can also benefit from
[16:35] potentially higher multipul over certain
[16:37] periods of time so there are a lot of
[16:40] factors to evaluate Bitcoin treasury
[16:44] companies and over time you might expect
[16:47] that this will even continue to
[16:49] complexify because Bitcoin treasury
[16:52] companies will potentially engage in
[16:54] more activities that will enable them uh
[16:58] to increase their their Bitcoin per
[16:59] share over time uh in in the context
[17:03] that it respects the core principles of
[17:06] keeping the the Bitcoin safe and uh not
[17:10] selling it of course that's super
[17:12] interesting also it's interesting for me
[17:13] to see how uh those Bitcoin metrics
[17:18] could in the
[17:19] future
[17:21] uh yeah B impact how investors buy into
[17:26] companies for example I find it really
[17:29] hard to invest now in any companies that
[17:31] don't have a Bitcoin strategy it's like
[17:33] I will not do it you need a a solid
[17:35] Bitcoin strategy right now I'm not
[17:37] investing in any companies but even if I
[17:39] wanted to invest in oh like I only look
[17:41] at companies that have a Bitcoin
[17:43] strategy otherwise how how how can I
[17:47] believe in the management team if they
[17:48] don't have a Bitcoin strategy yes also
[17:51] then the the Bitcoin per share and
[17:53] especially the yield aspect also of it
[17:55] which isn't the yield but the increase
[17:57] of the Bitcoin per share
[17:59] um it's super interesting because I know
[18:01] because I'm coming from the investment
[18:03] side of things I know how important
[18:05] earnings per share is is and the PE
[18:08] ratios of that and how permanent they
[18:11] always displayed also for the companies
[18:13] in the multiple set go with that um
[18:16] could Bitcoin per share be like even
[18:19] like a more important number in the
[18:21] future maybe you can also give us some
[18:23] insights of like how the traditional
[18:25] Financial space looks at that is that
[18:27] just something that bitcoiners are
[18:29] looking at or is that something that
[18:31] maybe is already looked at by
[18:33] traditional Financial market and they're
[18:35] like oh like that that could be
[18:36] something interesting or are we still
[18:38] too much in the bubble so I see three
[18:41] questions there
[18:43] uh the first one I think is um uh how um
[18:50] how does an investment in Bitcoin
[18:52] Compares with an invest investment in
[18:55] traditional companies uh how to value
[18:58] company now in the Bitcoin world that we
[19:03] start to live in and what is the future
[19:05] state so on your first question of the
[19:09] how to compare the investment and why
[19:11] even bother with companies instead of
[19:13] Bitcoin directly um I would say that um
[19:18] that's the power of focus you need to be
[19:21] laser eyes focused either as an
[19:23] individual or as a company on the
[19:27] accumulation of Bitcoin has a long
[19:30] long-term store of value because it is
[19:32] simply the the best store of value not
[19:35] only the best digital store of value but
[19:37] the best store value and the end of the
[19:39] story Michael saor has this famous chart
[19:42] where he says look you have Bitcoin at
[19:45] 60% uh annualized returns over four
[19:49] years you have magnificant seven at 30%
[19:52] you have the SNP
[19:54] 15% and then you go down like real
[19:57] estate 8% gold and so on until zero and
[20:01] even negative effective rates when you
[20:03] go on money market funds that deliver up
[20:06] to three% when the effective cost of
[20:08] capital is about 10% so effectively it
[20:13] is quite impossible for any company to
[20:17] outperform every year Bitcoin meaning to
[20:21] generate 60% plus return and risk
[20:25] adjusted um compared with Bitcoin where
[20:27] you don't have any risk of execution
[20:31] except if Bitcoin is not anymore
[20:34] decentralized and secure which is a
[20:37] probability that I would rate at minus
[20:42] 0.01% it exists you know but everyone
[20:45] should do its own research uh so that's
[20:48] the risk that you take with Bitcoin and
[20:51] this risk you can study it and you can
[20:53] go as as as down as you want in the
[20:56] rabbit hole and follow us bitcoiners but
[20:59] in this context of the best to Value
[21:01] because it's the only asset that
[21:03] provides absolute
[21:04] scarcity for an individual or for a
[21:07] company and in a world of monetary
[21:10] expansion and and depbt expansion and so
[21:13] on in a credit based system you have um
[21:16] the formula is the infinity divided by
[21:19] 21 million right so U so basically um in
[21:24] terms of comparing Investments or with
[21:28] over companies it's almost impossible to
[21:31] find another investment that would be
[21:32] best than Bitcoin The Only Exception
[21:36] potentially uh risk adjusted would be uh
[21:39] Bitcoin treasury companies uh because
[21:42] what is better in terms of returns
[21:45] potential returns than Bitcoin is
[21:48] Bitcoin is more Bitcoin right that's
[21:50] what Michael saor says and effectively
[21:54] if a Bitcoin treasury company is able to
[21:57] provide intelligence level aage with
[21:59] long-term convertible
[22:01] depth then effectively you have Micro
[22:04] strategy that is a 2X Bitcoin with the
[22:07] risk as an investor that you take of an
[22:09] operation of
[22:11] discretionary strategy from the the
[22:14] board and so on so effectively uh a
[22:18] company that one doesn't have Bitcoin on
[22:21] the balance sheet and two is not uh
[22:23] Bitcoin treasury
[22:26] company I don't see the the investment
[22:29] case you see so that's why I'm leading
[22:33] Bitcoin treasury company in France
[22:35] because I believe that this is uh the
[22:37] only strategy that can potentially uh
[22:41] provide more returns over time than
[22:45] Bitcoin itself because it is based and
[22:48] leveraged upon Bitcoin that that is the
[22:51] the core uh the core strategy right so
[22:55] um I believe that many companies will
[22:57] realize that
[22:59] and over time you will have 50% 70% of
[23:04] publicly traded companies that would
[23:06] have that will have at least a portion
[23:08] of their balance sheet on bitcoin but
[23:11] this will take 10 years and that's why
[23:13] also Bitcoin treasury companies have a
[23:14] lot of opportunities because now you
[23:17] have 85% of systemic banks in Europe and
[23:21] America that have open access to bitcoin
[23:24] through the ETFs and other Investments
[23:27] and on the other side you have
[23:28] corporates that less than 5% I are
[23:31] considering adding Bitcoin to their
[23:33] balance sheet so we are extremely early
[23:36] and per se the strategy of a Bitcoin
[23:39] treasury strategy uh is the winning one
[23:41] meaning that you are capitalizing on the
[23:44] best store of value that has a gigantic
[23:47] uh potential for the next five to 10
[23:49] years in and of itself because then
[23:52] Bitcoin treasury companies will
[23:54] potentially become uh the most
[23:57] capitalized comp companies in the world
[23:59] and then at some point where bitco
[24:01] Bitcoin is mainstream for corporate
[24:03] finance then these companies will be the
[24:06] the best place uh to do other things
[24:09] potentially uh to accumulate more
[24:12] Bitcoin because at this point
[24:14] potentially the only way to get more
[24:15] Bitcoin is to provide a product and a
[24:18] service to receive Bitcoin uh in a
[24:21] counterpart you know so uh but that's a
[24:24] very long future so that's for your
[24:26] first question and the second one
[24:29] um how to Value traditional companies
[24:33] well uh I you know I I had this
[24:36] conversation with someone and he was
[24:38] saying look um the company can be worth
[24:42] uh
[24:44] 7x uh the
[24:46] profitability uh of Any Given year and I
[24:49] said yes but this is in Fiat terms in
[24:53] Bitcoin terms this cash in seven years
[24:55] is worth nothing you see so in the
[24:58] context where Bitcoin goes uh from 100K
[25:01] to 1 million because this would only
[25:03] mean that Bitcoin reaches digital gold
[25:06] uh equivalent like the 20 trillion
[25:10] market cap that we are at two trillion
[25:12] now um in this context um you take one
[25:16] million of cash today this will be worth
[25:21] 100K uh in four to eight years you see
[25:25] so how to Value Trad additional
[25:28] companies well the answer is if this
[25:31] company is not adding Bitcoin to its
[25:33] balance sheet with its excess cash this
[25:36] company is going to the ground as a
[25:38] stable coin and that's the future of any
[25:41] company that doesn't acquire Bitcoin and
[25:44] that's why as a Bitcoin treasury company
[25:46] just in just two months we have
[25:48] outperformed the C 40 of the 40 biggest
[25:51] companies in France by 120
[25:55] 130% if you take six month chart you see
[25:58] that we are flat with them during the
[26:00] first four months then we adopt a
[26:02] Bitcoin strategy we go to the roof and
[26:04] they stay complete completely flat
[26:07] because even if a company does plus
[26:10] 15% this is nothing in Bitcoin terms if
[26:13] you do plus 15% but you don't accumulate
[26:16] Bitcoin well it just going to zero
[26:20] so on how to Value traditional companies
[26:24] the answer is it's a function of their
[26:26] Bitcoin strategy on the treasury side
[26:28] you cannot you can no longer provide
[26:31] shareholder value if you don't have an
[26:34] appropriate Bitcoin treasury strategy
[26:37] and then on your first third question if
[26:39] I remember correctly on the like the
[26:42] future
[26:43] outlook I would say that uh people are
[26:45] not ready for Bitcoin Capital markets we
[26:48] are going into a world where it's um
[26:52] Bitcoin is at the center of capital
[26:54] markets it is the standard store of
[26:57] value and and it has infiltrated all
[27:00] financial instruments in about 8 to 10
[27:03] years so it's starting today with
[27:06] convertible depth it's starting today
[27:10] with preferred stocks uh with what micro
[27:13] strategy is doing and it will infiltrate
[27:15] any Financial instrument um as a depth
[27:19] issuer uh and sorry as a as a financial
[27:22] institution if you provide a depbt to a
[27:26] company you will want uh to have a
[27:28] portion of Bitcoin either as a
[27:30] collateral or as a part of the
[27:33] allocation of the capital because this
[27:35] secures a lot the strategy because you
[27:38] have at least a very strong component of
[27:41] toore value uh in the in the financial
[27:45] instrument so in a future State you will
[27:47] also have Bitcoin uh that will be uh
[27:51] exchanged directly between Bitcoin and
[27:54] tokenized securities you already have
[27:57] that with stalker and Luxembourg using
[27:59] liquid uh the side chain of Bitcoin that
[28:02] is tokenizing for example micro strategy
[28:05] shares so you can already exchange
[28:07] Bitcoin with micro strategy shares and
[28:10] over the weekend so we'll have a 247 365
[28:14] Capital markets built on bitcoin and
[28:17] what do you think Bitcoin treasury
[28:19] companies will be worth at that time
[28:21] yeah it feels like all the things I hear
[28:25] is like the next five to 10 years
[28:27] there's a massive opportunity where it's
[28:31] so obvious where the future of capital
[28:33] markets and Bitcoin are going but
[28:38] 96.5% of the population is unaware of it
[28:42] h and they will figure it out over the
[28:44] next 10 years or not figure it out but
[28:48] be it's so obvious that they will move
[28:50] in that direction and Bitcoin will be so
[28:53] obvious that every CFO has to deal with
[28:55] that where in every board discussion it
[28:58] will be a part of the story so it's like
[29:01] an an short window of time where the
[29:03] risk of Bitcoin is so low and the
[29:06] potential is still so high that it's
[29:08] crazy for me because if you look back if
[29:11] you you could say like oh the
[29:12] opportunity was so much bigger in 2012
[29:15] but yeah you couldn't like the the I
[29:18] respect the people that b bought in
[29:21] Bitcoin in 2012 and already saw the
[29:24] things happening now because 2012 there
[29:27] were a lot of questions open the block
[29:29] says what didn't happen uh there is no
[29:32] public lated company in there no
[29:34] politicians talks about that not not
[29:36] even talk about the president but no no
[29:39] no name for politicians talks about it
[29:42] like there's nothing you could see in do
[29:44] 12 of all the things that happen right
[29:47] now just 12 years later where it's like
[29:50] now it's kind of obvious what direction
[29:52] we are moving we have all the puzzle
[29:54] pieces into place we're just seeing how
[29:57] the game goes knows and the next 10
[29:59] years will be very good um for the world
[30:03] I think and for Bitcoin I think so s
[30:06] sorry for my small rent but really big
[30:10] of the rent is it basically uh what you
[30:13] have and Jeff BR just published a great
[30:17] interview on this with Natalie Brunell I
[30:21] think uh on uh how Bitcoin uh is
[30:25] basically uh like the first uh like the
[30:28] free first free market that you have
[30:32] that is entering the global first Global
[30:34] free market that is entering a
[30:37] manipulated Market where Supply is being
[30:40] forc
[30:41] manipulated um and basically this will
[30:43] reprise the world and um the the normal
[30:46] order of of markets is deflationary
[30:49] that's the big argument of Jeff um
[30:52] because basically you you gain
[30:54] productivity and all the all everyone is
[30:58] looking to improve services and products
[31:01] and gain competitive advantage and so on
[31:03] so in its natural state the world should
[31:05] be deflationary and it's not only
[31:08] because um of the credit based system
[31:12] that is absorbing and even more creating
[31:15] inflation so you have Bitcoin This
[31:17] Global free market that is now entering
[31:21] the traditional Financial world and this
[31:24] will completely rep reprice uh the
[31:27] financial world
[31:28] and as we were saying like how this
[31:30] impacts the valuation of traditional
[31:33] companies well this will impact the
[31:35] valuation and the pricing of any
[31:37] Financial instrument um and financial
[31:41] institutions uh will organize around
[31:44] Bitcoin as we all do so um
[31:48] basically then the the tradeoff we are
[31:50] making um because we don't have a choice
[31:53] is Bitcoin is for everyone so um Bitcoin
[31:57] will also be and is already for
[31:59] financial institutions and so um it's
[32:03] also important to keep in mind like the
[32:06] development of peer-to-peer technology
[32:09] and freedom Technologies like Noster and
[32:11] so on to make sure that uh as at the
[32:15] same time that we develop the
[32:16] institutional side we still keep in mind
[32:19] the the primary objective right of
[32:21] peer-to-peer cash uh even if Bitcoin is
[32:24] primarily a store value Asset um
[32:28] you don't have a store of value if you
[32:30] cannot exchange it right so the globally
[32:34] exchangeable part is as much important
[32:37] as the store value uh part uh yet um the
[32:42] the kpi and the key success factor for
[32:45] Bitcoin remains and will always be the
[32:48] 21 million so any proposition that would
[32:53] go uh against uh the robustness and the
[32:57] optimization for the store of value will
[33:00] likely fail um and I I think that the
[33:04] the The Innovation around Bitcoin will
[33:06] come from
[33:08] applications uh and layers around
[33:10] Bitcoin itself to preserve the most
[33:13] important thing which is the the non
[33:16] manipulated uh store value um use case
[33:20] that we have with the 21 million which
[33:23] is the most important 100% that's that's
[33:26] the hard core if if that falls apart uh
[33:29] everything else
[33:30] is kind of irrelevant I think um how big
[33:34] of a
[33:35] Shockwave is micro strategy in the in
[33:38] the traditional Financial space what
[33:41] what do you hear from like um other
[33:44] companies that aren't Bitcoin and they
[33:46] don't have Bitcoin treasury that that
[33:49] also notice now how micro strategies is
[33:51] kind of sending that huge uh shock wve
[33:54] into the digital Financial space I don't
[33:57] know if it's still true today but the
[33:59] last time I checked it even outperformed
[34:01] uh Nvidia and and most of the otherb 500
[34:05] companies uh since they adopted a
[34:07] Bitcoin standard I mean that has to be
[34:09] something every CEO and CFO has to look
[34:13] at like that that that should not be
[34:15] unnoticed
[34:16] unnoticed yeah exactly um well as I
[34:20] mentioned before when I was at Accenture
[34:22] and I was working with these 30 plus
[34:24] financial institutions and from my past
[34:27] experience with with the corporate
[34:29] treasurers um what I can say is um that
[34:33] you you are not above 5% of publicly
[34:37] traded companies uh today that are
[34:40] thinking about a Bitcoin treasury
[34:42] strategy yet uh we went from about zero
[34:46] to about two three even potentially 5%
[34:51] so um the the the growth is real but we
[34:56] are extremely early
[34:58] um and what we have and what we will
[35:00] need uh to go from a state of 5%
[35:04] considering it to a state of 10% 15% 20%
[35:09] consider considering it is if you have a
[35:12] massive multinational
[35:14] corporation that that does it like
[35:16] Microsoft or Amazon or apple uh this
[35:20] type of companies we are thinking about
[35:22] meta this type of companies that are
[35:26] more mainstream
[35:28] and the more traditional company the
[35:30] more impact it will have uh or the more
[35:33] adopted already companies by traditional
[35:35] investors the more impact it will have
[35:37] uh it basically the corporate treasurers
[35:40] need their black rock moment for
[35:41] financial institutions you see corporate
[35:45] Treasurer are still at the moment uh for
[35:48] Bitcoin than was that than were Banks
[35:52] before black run launched the ETFs
[35:55] basically so you you need this Black
[35:58] Rock moment but for corporate treasurers
[36:01] we not only a corporate that says okay I
[36:03] will put 2% but a huge corporate
[36:07] multinational that says that was before
[36:09] a skeptic that now becomes a full
[36:11] Bitcoin maximalist uh like Michael
[36:15] seller or at least that promotes Bitcoin
[36:18] and Bitcoin only right so uh there there
[36:21] is a need for this yet even without this
[36:24] during this cycle uh it's potentially
[36:27] that it will happen this cycle but even
[36:30] without this uh you will see already a
[36:33] wave and we are already seeing it like
[36:35] every week or even a few days every few
[36:38] days you see a new publicly traded
[36:40] company that announces having both uh
[36:43] Bitcoin for their
[36:44] treasury um strategy so now what piece
[36:50] piece of thought that I would have for
[36:53] corporate treasurers that are thinking
[36:55] about this strategy is to not make make
[36:57] the mistake of thinking that this is an
[37:00] insurance policy for the future of
[37:04] Fiat uh if you consider it as a as an
[37:07] insurance policy and you only buy like
[37:09] 2% of your long-term capital uh Bitcoin
[37:14] um with Bitcoin uh you are you are
[37:16] committing a huge mistake because the
[37:19] example I give is if you have 100 units
[37:22] of capital and you have the choice
[37:24] between uh Zimbabwe currency and the USD
[37:28] uh will you put 95% of your capital in
[37:31] the Zimbabwe currency and say that 5% is
[37:33] an insurance policy with the US dollar
[37:36] no you will P put as much as possible in
[37:39] the US dollar well when you have choice
[37:42] between the local currency and Bitcoin
[37:46] meaning negative effective rate of
[37:49] return annually and uh 40 to 60%
[37:53] effective rate of return over four years
[37:56] well you put as much as POS possible of
[37:58] your long-term capital treasury uh into
[38:01] Bitcoin and not just like a 2%
[38:05] allocation if not what are you doing
[38:07] with the
[38:08] 98% you are wasting shareholder value if
[38:11] you are not allocating as much um
[38:14] long-term capital to bitcoin as possible
[38:16] I partnered up with coin vigilante this
[38:20] is the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[38:23] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[38:26] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[38:29] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[38:32] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[38:35] go out there and show that you are a
[38:37] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[38:40] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[38:43] dropped a completely new and amazing
[38:46] Genesis edition of their watch
[38:49] collections you have the date of the
[38:51] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[38:54] and of course also the block height and
[38:57] which which Epoch we are currently in I
[39:00] love the level of detail they put in in
[39:03] this masterpiece and make sure to check
[39:05] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[39:08] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[39:11] those watches so so much if you watch or
[39:14] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[39:16] I'll guess you already bought some
[39:19] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[39:21] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[39:25] in a hardware wallet my personal
[39:26] recommendation for hard wallet is the
[39:29] bit boox it's super secure it's simple
[39:31] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[39:33] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[39:36] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[39:40] with the code Robin at the checkout
[39:42] visit bitbox Swiss robobin to get your
[39:46] bitbox and the next step is to really
[39:49] level up your sovereignty as an
[39:51] individual you have to have the most
[39:53] secure self custody setup you have to
[39:56] secure your own devices you have to
[39:59] protect your privacy you have to set up
[40:02] an inheritance plan and depending on
[40:04] where you live you even want to have a
[40:06] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[40:09] in case something goes really really
[40:11] wrong and through all those steps the
[40:13] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step

[40:18] way.com
[40:20] Partners Robin you even get a 30 minute
[40:23] free call to find out how you can level
[40:26] up your s love that so so basically also
[40:29] what you're saying is we for for the
[40:33] massive influx of money from
[40:37] corporations we need a big moment so
[40:39] basically I I prepared uh while you were
[40:42] talking that that website quickly um so
[40:46] basically we need one of the really big
[40:48] guys like like a Microsoft like a uh
[40:51] made a planet I mean Tesla has I think
[40:53] like you already have Tesla right 9,000
[40:56] Bitcoin but think they are not bullish
[41:00] enough on it and they're not vocal
[41:01] enough on it I guess and if we have like
[41:05] one of those who have like a substantial
[41:07] amount of money like I don't know Google
[41:09] saying oh like 10% of our assets go into
[41:12] into Bitcoin or something like that that
[41:14] you are saying that it would completely
[41:16] trigger that whole adoption yes yes
[41:21] exactly and and people are aside from
[41:23] this people are completely sleeping on
[41:25] the fact that the US wants to build a
[41:27] Bitcoin strategic
[41:30] Reserve it's crazy to see right because
[41:33] you would think that uh if the number
[41:36] one country in the world uh is planning
[41:40] to build the Bitcoin strategic Reserve
[41:43] uh people would change their mind a
[41:45] little bit or at least have the
[41:46] Curiosity to investigate a bit more
[41:48] Bitcoin and yet um everyone is lost in
[41:52] their day-to-day activities uh and they
[41:55] don't take the time to understand
[41:57] Bitcoin but I'm confident that uh the
[42:01] number of people that take the time is
[42:03] increasing over time and that we are
[42:05] reaching a Tipping Point as well I think
[42:08] it's extremely positive what we can see
[42:11] uh we see the number of Bitcoin
[42:13] treasuries for public companies
[42:15] increasing every day uh Bitcoin treasury
[42:19] companies that have started their
[42:20] strategy are also increasing the number
[42:23] of Bitcoin they accumulate and at some
[42:26] point you know the time works for us
[42:29] because Bitcoin is doing its thing it's
[42:32] being adopted and then you get the
[42:34] Bitcoin at the price that you deserve so
[42:37] um effectively uh it's a meritocracy uh
[42:41] where um the the strongest that you
[42:44] study Bitcoin the strongest you
[42:46] understand it and the more you can
[42:48] prepare yourself your company your
[42:50] family
[42:51] ET absolutely um do you think that uh
[42:55] there's an executive order coming so
[42:57] that Trump is not waiting uh for the
[42:59] bill to pass and uh giving the
[43:01] Competitive Edge to him and America with
[43:04] an executive order I see more more uh
[43:07] talks around that yeah well no one will
[43:10] know until the the effective date that
[43:13] it's signed of course uh but at least um
[43:17] he he said very precisely that they will
[43:21] not sell the Bitcoin uh I think the
[43:24] probability that I've heard uh is
[43:27] extremely high that there is at least
[43:30] like a strategic stock pile where you
[43:33] you don't sell and you at least transfer
[43:36] part of the Bitcoin because part of it
[43:38] is from bitex coin so uh it's not all of
[43:41] it but um the probability is quite high
[43:44] as well that you see a moderate purchase
[43:49] of Bitcoin uh that's a probability
[43:52] basically it's not a matter of if but
[43:55] when at this point because um even if
[43:58] it's not made uh at at length during
[44:02] this four-year period you can imagine
[44:04] that bitcoiners will uh will increase
[44:08] over time in the world and so the the
[44:11] Bitcoin strategic Reserve will happen
[44:13] anyway but um I would have said that uh
[44:17] maybe before the election of Donald
[44:19] Trump but now with the election of
[44:20] Donald Trump and the Fantastic Team of
[44:23] bitcoiners that are around it um it's EX
[44:27] extremely probable that this Bitcoin
[44:28] strategic Reserve happens happens fast
[44:32] and with Bitcoin purchases and not only
[44:35] uh um keeping the Bitcoin that they have
[44:39] uh it just that for the purchase it
[44:41] might take a bit more time that people
[44:43] expect because uh it's the US it's a you
[44:47] know it's um there is a separation of
[44:50] power and so on and and you want to have
[44:52] a public debate about it potentially so
[44:55] it might take a bit of time but I think
[44:58] uh the time is now to do it uh and
[45:01] effectively if you have another major
[45:05] country in the world that does it before
[45:07] uh in any case it's it will only
[45:09] accelerate the need to have more Bitcoin
[45:12] uh for any country so um yeah the
[45:16] probability is very high it's so crazy
[45:18] to see National State Game Theory
[45:20] playing out in front of our eyes it's
[45:22] it's just like it's crazy that what time
[45:25] we are living in and uh I came came into
[45:28] Bitcoin like four and a half years ago
[45:30] something like that uh that was so far
[45:33] away it seems like that was that that's
[45:36] crazy that yes uh the United States do
[45:39] it one interesting question I have um we
[45:42] have altcoins and we have Bitcoins and
[45:46] in the past in the bull cycle a lot of
[45:49] the talk was always like oh like you
[45:50] should get into some altcoins to um have
[45:53] a faster horse on bitcoin and get more
[45:56] Bitcoin with that I was always very
[45:58] against that I was always like oh like
[46:00] why buy some some other thing that might
[46:04] get you more Bitcoin or might lose you
[46:06] everything like that seems risky and
[46:07] Bitcoin already is such a fast horse um
[46:11] and now this cycle there's a new thing
[46:14] coming along this is this Bitcoin
[46:16] tragedy companies like micro strategy
[46:19] who are kind of a faster horse to
[46:22] bitcoin is is micro strategy and soon
[46:26] others stealing kind of the funer of
[46:29] altcoins of like that Narrative of like
[46:31] oh if you want a faster Bitcoin horse
[46:34] you don't go with I don't know cadano
[46:36] but you go with micro strategy not
[46:39] saying that micro strategy is altcoin
[46:42] but uh the the appreciation of it is
[46:46] faster than Bitcoin because they not
[46:48] only can stack Bitcoin they can leverage
[46:50] Bitcoin and they also can have um
[46:52] revenue on top of it um so uh I would
[46:56] like to give a shout out to Sam Kahan
[46:58] because like before the the ETF was
[47:04] approved he was in an interview and he
[47:06] said he predicted that there would be no
[47:10] like let's say altcoin season this time
[47:13] and that the inflows for Bitcoin would
[47:15] be so massive uh that it would take all
[47:18] the capital basically and when I was
[47:21] working with banks at the time um they
[47:24] were realizing the same they were
[47:26] realizing that the inflows and the
[47:28] demand for Bitcoin was so huge uh and it
[47:31] was coming out of the crypto asset
[47:34] ecosystem it was coming from traditional
[47:37] finance and so the while the the altcoin
[47:41] market was like a closed loop like you
[47:43] took gains from this token to put them
[47:46] in another one and then recycle them in
[47:49] another one and steak and restake and so
[47:51] on and I used to say look you can focus
[47:55] all of your time in these small
[47:56] strategies that one of them will win and
[48:00] then nine of them will fail and at the
[48:03] end of all of this energy spent on all
[48:05] of this closed loop ecosystem that
[48:08] serves its own purpose uh you will not
[48:12] allocate the time necessary to
[48:14] understand Bitcoin and to focus on
[48:16] bitcoin and to allocate to Bitcoin in
[48:17] size I think people don't understand the
[48:20] power of focus and the power of the size
[48:24] of the allocation of capital uh because
[48:26] because it's not the same to allocate
[48:29] One units to casino than to allocate one
[48:34] 100 unit to something that provides you
[48:36] with 40 to 60% annualized returns based
[48:40] on historical performance it's not the
[48:42] same so um based only on this uh I would
[48:47] say that um the the type of flows into
[48:50] Bitcoin are completely different from uh
[48:53] any altcoin Market I mean at this point
[48:56] I think everyone has realized uh if not
[48:59] let's study I guess uh everyone has
[49:02] realized that over uh blockchains and so
[49:06] on can be interesting for like business
[49:09] application from the technology
[49:10] perspective not for their coin and or
[49:13] token but sometimes some company will
[49:15] find an interesting way to apply it and
[49:19] even with this many times like the only
[49:21] technology that has really stri been
[49:25] been used is table coins you know so and
[49:27] even stable coin at some point they will
[49:29] be on a Bitcoin layer so it's only a
[49:32] matter of time so on this I I fully
[49:36] agree that like the the focus um and the
[49:39] message is like um even if you find the
[49:43] faster horse on the short term you are
[49:45] losing your time and you are wasting
[49:47] your Capital because um the attention
[49:50] that you lose and the the the power of
[49:53] the capital that you you can allocate to
[49:55] the winner is is so important that you
[49:59] are making a mistake then on your
[50:01] question in the on the micro strategy
[50:03] side um I would say that it's completely
[50:06] different because uh it's fully based on
[50:09] bitcoin uh it would be extremely
[50:12] different if uh micro strategy was using
[50:16] the Bitcoin for specific things and it
[50:20] was trying to make like sophisticated
[50:23] strategies and trying to generate a
[50:25] yield and this kind things um they are
[50:29] not they are keeping their Bitcoin in
[50:31] Cold Storage uh and they are
[50:33] accumulating as much of it as possible U
[50:36] so in terms of uh the difference I think
[50:39] it's huge I think it it's not even
[50:42] comparable um yet there is risk uh in
[50:46] investing in a security which is micro
[50:49] strategy and blockchain group and metap
[50:52] Planet those are
[50:54] securities um and so there are more risk
[50:56] R uh there are thousands of risks uh
[51:00] from the country risk from the
[51:03] operational risk and so on like you have
[51:06] many risks but um more risk more return
[51:10] potential uh as well in in the base that
[51:14] the strategy is based on top of Bitcoin
[51:17] uh and so as long as the strategy is
[51:19] based on bitcoin I think it's uh quite
[51:22] reasonable to assume that um with
[51:26] intelligent leverage you you could
[51:28] potentially have a better return
[51:33] potential uh than Bitcoin only let's say
[51:37] but even this I would say is not the
[51:40] right comparison I would say that uh
[51:44] Bitcoin directly is not completely
[51:46] comparable to a Bitcoin treasury company
[51:49] because a Bitcoin treasury company is an
[51:50] operating company so the the best
[51:53] comparison is between stocks of
[51:56] companies
[51:57] uh how do you compare a Bitcoin treasury
[51:59] company with another one and can the the
[52:03] annualize returns of Bitcoin treasury
[52:05] company completely outperform a
[52:07] portfolio made of traditional companies
[52:09] that don't have Bitcoin on the balance
[52:11] sheet I'm just saying how long do you
[52:14] think it takes them to figure that out
[52:18] all the big companies uh you mentioned
[52:20] before 10 years is that a time frame
[52:23] you're looking at you that where like
[52:25] most of the big corporations at least
[52:28] have some sort of Bitcoin strategy don't
[52:32] have to be all in like micro strategy
[52:34] but like at least like five 10% there a
[52:36] substantial amount is still is that like
[52:38] 10 years and time frame you're looking
[52:40] at um I would say that uh there are
[52:44] tipping points like in the theory of
[52:46] adoption of Technology the S curves uh
[52:49] when you reach between 13 20% of
[52:54] adoption you reach a Tipping Point where
[52:56] just goes mainstream then it goes to
[52:59] escape velocity it goes too fast the
[53:01] adoption is very
[53:02] fast but we are we are very close to it
[53:06] from the financial perspective from the
[53:09] financial institutions perspective and
[53:11] uh that's why we see so much inflows and
[53:13] historical success in the Bitcoin
[53:16] ETFs um because you have like 20% of the
[53:20] population that have um from a short
[53:24] distance or long distance touch Bitcoin
[53:26] in some way uh so that's why we are
[53:29] reaching this Tipping Point right now
[53:31] and that's why we see so much demand and
[53:33] so much things happening on the
[53:35] corporate side we might be one cycle
[53:37] away from this so um it might go
[53:41] faster but I I would think that we could
[53:46] go from
[53:47] 5% uh considering it to 5% doing it and
[53:52] 15% considering it or 20% considering it
[53:57] uh by the the end of this cycle or the
[53:59] beginning of next one and that we reach
[54:01] the Tipping Point by the beginning of
[54:04] next Bitcoin cycle um if there are still
[54:08] cycles of course but based on the
[54:10] hving uh yeah I would say that overall
[54:14] uh both for institutional adoption and
[54:17] for corporate adoption and for Bitcoin
[54:20] overall I would say that uh 20 30 will
[54:25] be a big
[54:27] Milestone um I would say before of
[54:30] course 2028 2029 but around this I think
[54:34] will be a huge milestone because it will
[54:36] be between the 2028 cycle and the 2032
[54:40] cycle uh and that's when uh we will
[54:43] potentially go from 1 million to five
[54:46] million uh Bitcoin you know so or in in
[54:50] two days in today's dollars right so
[54:53] could be even higher of course um
[54:56] depending on where we are so yeah at
[54:59] these levels I I we could assume um of
[55:04] course it's not 100% certain but we
[55:07] could assume that corporate adoption
[55:09] would be far far far way far away
[55:13] advanced than what it is today abolutely
[55:17] 100% agree with that um we often talk on
[55:21] the podcast uh of the impact that
[55:25] Bitcoin has on on society the impact
[55:27] that Bitcoin has on the individual how
[55:31] it changes the time preference how is
[55:33] that for big
[55:36] corporations like how does Bitcoin
[55:39] change uh corporations outside of they
[55:43] have more money they are more successful
[55:46] is is there any other impacts that you
[55:48] think uh organization change by just
[55:53] having Bitcoin standard yeah absolutely
[55:56] well um it's like on an individual
[56:00] level uh every spending is comparable to
[56:04] spending Bitcoin because the money you
[56:06] spend on other things even if it's
[56:08] spending in Fiat uh it's Bitcoin that
[56:11] you don't buy right so um the basically
[56:15] you you have a different cost of
[56:18] capital uh the cost of capital today is
[56:21] around
[56:22] 10% uh basically you could say it's the
[56:25] S&P 500 like if if you wouldn't use your
[56:28] money and you would put it on the S&P
[56:29] 500 you would get 10 to 15% potentially
[56:33] if you compare with financial
[56:35] performance uh historical performance so
[56:38] uh the the cost of capital for a Bitcoin
[56:40] focused
[56:42] company uh an operational company is the
[56:46] the the the annualized return potential
[56:48] of Bitcoin any uh money any investment
[56:52] uh that wouldn't return uh this
[56:56] potential um is potentially money wasted
[56:59] so that's huge thing to say then there
[57:02] are uh of course exceptions to this
[57:05] because as in our individual life there
[57:09] is I think and I believe strongly only
[57:12] one thing that is most important than uh
[57:15] buying Bitcoin is to invest in
[57:18] oneself
[57:20] uh it can be like investing in traveling
[57:24] uh to learn a new country investing in
[57:27] learning new skills learning uh new
[57:30] things um and and so and growing as a
[57:34] family and so on I think this is why we
[57:38] live as humans so as a company uh it can
[57:41] also be the same potentially uh
[57:44] investing in oneself uh potentially can
[57:47] provide uh higher long-term returns uh
[57:51] than Bitcoin per se but it's much more
[57:54] calculated when you are on a Bitcoin
[57:57] standard and much more conscious in
[58:00] terms of the tradeoff that you are
[58:01] making it should really be an investment
[58:03] it it cannot be just spending money like
[58:06] this you know so uh and in terms of
[58:09] focus of the time uh that's also
[58:12] extremely important because then um as
[58:16] time goes um a lot of the focus goes to
[58:20] Bitcoin today of course because the
[58:22] analized return are extremely high
[58:24] compared with oper operational
[58:25] activities is uh but you you could
[58:28] assume that in four years eight years um
[58:31] there would be a lot of Bitcoin
[58:33] operational activities uh that will also
[58:36] generate a lot of potential Revenue over
[58:39] time so I would say that for an
[58:42] operational
[58:43] company um and that's what metap planet
[58:46] is starting to do as well uh they have
[58:49] started Bitcoin magazine Japan uh and
[58:52] shout out to them it's quite interesting
[58:54] they are developing a Bitcoin related
[58:56] business so um at the end of the day um
[59:01] the the next logical thing for uh
[59:04] Bitcoin treasury company to do uh might
[59:07] in fact be to develop Bitcoin related
[59:09] businesses uh to complement their
[59:12] existing operational business or to
[59:15] extend it so that's something very
[59:18] interesting that we see at metap Planet
[59:20] something very interesting that Michael
[59:23] saor had been developing as well before
[59:25] like a lightning
[59:27] um solution and and a run check solution
[59:31] so um this will develop over time but it
[59:35] takes time uh and over time as in
[59:38] traditional markets um you you might see
[59:42] a lot of m&a activity as well happening
[59:44] between Bitcoin companies or between
[59:48] Bitcoin and non-bitcoin companies uh to
[59:50] grow uh that's that's something that you
[59:53] see in traditional markets so you could
[59:56] potentially see in Bitcoin land you you
[59:58] see so basically anything that you see
[60:00] in traditional markets I think will
[60:02] happen uh over time on top of Bitcoin
[60:05] because traditional markets are being
[60:07] built on top of Bitcoin Sant I love that
[60:11] and uh we I mean there's so much more to
[60:14] get into we're already the one hour mark
[60:18] I I I love that and I know to keep it
[60:20] like that maybe do a second round
[60:23] extending um one question I ask each and
[60:25] every one of my gu is what can we learn
[60:27] from you besides
[60:30] Bitcoin oh besides Bitcoin well I live
[60:33] in Paris uh and I love the city uh and I
[60:37] hope that um we will build um something
[60:43] that that will be huge for Bitcoin and
[60:46] for the adoption of Bitcoin in a
[60:48] continent Europe that is full of History
[60:52] uh and uh full of great food and cure
[60:56] and I I hope that uh we will work not
[61:00] only on bitcoin but on developing the
[61:03] the financial uh activity uh and freedom
[61:08] uh in Europe through the Bitcoin lens as
[61:10] well yeah I was I was already I think
[61:12] three or four times in Paris it's a it's
[61:14] a great City I love it I was even there
[61:18] for uh uh a shitcoin conference once uh
[61:22] what we call it was huge it was so huge
[61:26] I forgot how it was called but it was
[61:28] definitely a shitcoin conference but it
[61:30] was
[61:31] fun see there uh and grab some food and
[61:35] be in the city also well the food is
[61:37] quite impressive the the quality of life
[61:40] in this sense has nothing to do with
[61:44] anything else in the world maybe except
[61:46] Italy uh and other European countries um
[61:51] of course you you pay more tax uh but
[61:54] yeah the the the quality of the food and
[61:57] the life is quite quite impressive and
[61:59] so uh I can see a future where we have
[62:03] more freedom economic freedom especially
[62:07] uh and um and where you can have this
[62:10] the quality of life plus uh the
[62:13] financial expansion that you can get on
[62:16] a Bitcoin
[62:17] standard very nice I I really do do hope
[62:21] that um we have an end routine in the
[62:23] podcast where the previous gu asked
[62:26] question from next guest without knowing
[62:27] who the next guest actually is um the
[62:30] question is an interesting one what was
[62:33] your fa process looking like when you
[62:37] were against Bitcoin if that was the
[62:40] case and how did that change that so you
[62:42] know like how most people start as
[62:44] critics how was that for you so I've
[62:48] never been against Bitcoin I've always
[62:50] been a
[62:52] technology positive person very looking
[62:55] forward in terms of application of new
[62:58] technologies but uh the first thought
[63:00] that I had um was that Bitcoin was like
[63:04] level one technology and then you had
[63:07] ethereum a level two like like
[63:09] innovation in a traditional uh Web Two
[63:12] sense you know like in terms of
[63:15] innovating the technology and I didn't
[63:18] see the store of value um purpose and
[63:22] especially the censorship resistance at
[63:25] the time I think it was like
[63:28] 2016 so I I didn't see that at the time
[63:31] and in fact it was it was the good thing
[63:34] that I didn't have money at this time to
[63:38] not not get in invested in other things
[63:41] so it it was back in 2020 during covid
[63:45] that I realized that I had no Freedom
[63:48] left uh not even the right to go out of
[63:51] the home and do one kilometer away in
[63:54] Paris that realized that I desperately
[63:58] needed uh something a tool uh to regain
[64:03] um my my financial sovereignty because
[64:07] without Financial sovereignty uh you are
[64:09] very far from Freedom U at all so um
[64:14] yeah that that's where I discovered the
[64:16] true value of Bitcoin as the most
[64:19] decentralized and secure network bonded
[64:21] by energy uh that is the only way to
[64:25] provide provide absolute cty to the
[64:27] world and to myself my family my
[64:31] colleagues the society bitcoiners and
[64:33] the world I love that thank you so much
[64:35] uh before I let you go where can people
[64:38] find you ask your questions and and
[64:40] reach out to you well thank you so much
