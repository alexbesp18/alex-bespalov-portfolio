[00:00] crypto and Fiat is almost the same
[00:02] bucket such a big bubble that either it
[00:04] has to just collapse itself or it will
[00:06] continue to be worse and worse and worse
[00:08] and maybe naturally die very powerful
[00:10] people decide that they are going to
[00:12] issue a piece of paper C money they
[00:14] decide what's the value of it how much
[00:16] worth it has and who gets it first
[00:19] they're building a parallel reality that
[00:21] is really like beautiful you will
[00:23] actually be happier you will finally see
[00:25] the world and you will be full of Hope
[00:27] don't read the headlines or the news
[00:29] collect information to build your own
[00:30] opinion we have a thinking crisis it's
[00:33] easy to use Bitcoin to give it to earn
[00:36] it to get it
[00:41] back why Bitcoin and why work in
[00:45] Bitcoin why Bitcoin why work in Bitcoin
[00:48] um why Bitcoin because this is really
[00:50] something that sparked or helped me to
[00:54] gain back the Hope um in in the world
[00:56] and a Humanity um long story but yeah
[00:59] from every single perspective even
[01:01] though before I I started working let's
[01:03] say full-time in the in the Bitcoin
[01:04] space um I used to help many different
[01:06] projects contribute um having my Fiat
[01:09] job or later which is also in my
[01:11] professional um career um being naive I
[01:14] I work in the web three space and trying
[01:16] to change something there so even before
[01:19] um even before I I made this transition
[01:22] to um to bitcoin only um and full-time
[01:25] um it was something that was giving me
[01:28] hope and energy so um um yeah seeing all
[01:31] the rotten let's say reality around and
[01:34] and so many set things or people who are
[01:36] not thinking for themselves and um yeah
[01:39] all these kind of things you can feel
[01:40] depressed stressed um and then when you
[01:43] go back or you know that there is this
[01:44] par so to say space and and completely
[01:47] different um reality growing thriving
[01:50] yeah it gives you hope um so yeah that's
[01:52] why Bitcoin and that's why working in
[01:54] Bitcoin so I finally took the step and
[01:56] said no um I want to do it full-time um
[01:59] from whichever angle and yeah actually
[02:01] I'm working in a few different projects
[02:03] so yeah it takes quite some time but it
[02:05] keeps a lot of satisfaction and fun yeah
[02:08] so you worked before in web free crypto
[02:12] altcoin world have marketing background
[02:15] and I've been also working in the
[02:16] banking industry and the trading
[02:18] industry the recent things like I mean
[02:20] recent I mean like five maybe six seven
[02:22] years ago um then um yeah I was hired as
[02:28] well um in in two or three different
[02:32] companies web three um crypto C Krypto
[02:35] let me put it this way uh still you know
[02:38] I was so naive and it was like this
[02:40] stage I don't know if you had it or your
[02:42] um audience can resonate with this but
[02:45] when you're in some stage of your
[02:46] Bitcoin Journey you are still like oh my
[02:48] God it's so amazing I I'm going to
[02:50] change everyone and doesn't matter that
[02:52] these people are doing this thing I will
[02:53] tell them how amazing Bitcoin is and how
[02:55] different and I'm going to uh change
[02:56] their perspective but after some time
[02:58] you see that not necessary it works so
[03:00] now I'm in the stage of like okay let
[03:02] them know that I exist if they need me
[03:04] they can come to me instead of me going
[03:06] to there and and trying to evangelized
[03:08] this way um but I was so naive thinking
[03:11] that yeah if I will be working there
[03:12] from inside I have um let's say a power
[03:16] quote unquote to change things to to
[03:18] help these people uh from that
[03:19] perspective so yeah I I I work there as
[03:21] well ah really cool but then you shifted
[03:25] from like I I always put like feat and
[03:28] crypto in in like one Market uh for me
[03:31] it's like an extension to that like it's
[03:32] it's it's kind of the similar thing even
[03:34] though there like difference between
[03:36] this but it's for me the same thing and
[03:38] then you shifted now to bitcoin only
[03:41] that because honestly and this is kind
[03:43] of personal I couldn't I couldn't stand
[03:45] it mentally anymore so as you say and I
[03:48] I will try not to be toxic but um um
[03:51] yeah when you said that um crypto and
[03:54] Fiat is almost the same uh bucket
[03:56] working in both and just to remind again
[03:58] it was Banking and trading as well for a
[04:00] while and before even like let's say big
[04:03] different corporations um I realized how
[04:07] disgusting sometimes this thing is from
[04:09] inside even discussing in the sense that
[04:10] people who are operating there they are
[04:13] like really enslaved mentally as well
[04:15] and then going through another world
[04:17] this web free crypto I realized that
[04:19] this thing is even more disgusting
[04:20] because you know the fat culture and not
[04:21] to excuse anyone you can say that you
[04:24] are born into it so you have really
[04:26] nothing to compare or you are kind of
[04:27] like really um manipul at in a sense
[04:30] that you have to be there so it's
[04:31] sometimes very difficult to go um out of
[04:34] your comfort zone and see something else
[04:36] the difference for me with all the
[04:37] krupto web free and this is what I saw
[04:40] from inside um is done on purpose
[04:43] consciously knowing what's the problem
[04:45] with the Fiat system and how to use
[04:48] similar mechanisms in a way to not
[04:51] necessarily do great things I'm not
[04:52] saying everyone in this phace is is
[04:55] trying to scam and and has bad
[04:57] intentions but how overall this pH works
[05:01] uh is more disgusting and more rotten
[05:03] than the Fiat system and then after some
[05:05] time being in these two different worlds
[05:07] and in my so to say free time being
[05:10] engaged with different Bitcoin projects
[05:12] trying temporary to help different
[05:13] people that I know from the space I was
[05:15] feeling really like torn and and bad so
[05:17] I said at the very beginning that why
[05:19] Bitcoin because it gives me hope but
[05:20] after some time if you are let's say
[05:23] jungling in between these two worlds you
[05:26] cannot really mentally handle anymore so
[05:29] I notic I can I I was more um stressed
[05:32] during my working hours I was more yeah
[05:34] sometimes even as people say toxic
[05:36] because I didn't have so starting from
[05:39] this naive perspective later I was just
[05:41] losing my hope and my energy and then I
[05:43] was just like you know very sharp I'm
[05:45] also a very direct person so I I just
[05:47] decided that it doesn't make sense I I
[05:49] don't see any progress and it's better
[05:50] that I just allocate my time and energy
[05:53] um in my life to to what I love to what
[05:56] I believe in um instead of trying to
[05:58] change something that is like instead of
[06:00] trying to shape the stone you know um so
[06:03] yeah it's interesting for me because
[06:05] when we are talking about the Bitcoin
[06:07] Community sometimes like a certain group
[06:10] can be really toxic uh and I think I
[06:14] think it's even good for Bitcoin I think
[06:16] that uh to have some really advocates
[06:20] for you that are completely um
[06:23] intolerant of uh and I don't know if if
[06:26] this this was what described you in back
[06:29] in the day I I don't know but uh in
[06:31] completely intolerant of something that
[06:34] even looks a little bit like crypto or
[06:36] feed uh gives the gives a certain Edge
[06:39] to the Bitcoin Community I was that like
[06:42] one year ago I'm getting way more soft
[06:45] of Bitcoin Max nowadays I'm I'm more
[06:48] becoming like a free market maximalist
[06:50] because if you become a free market
[06:52] maximalist I think you will get to be a
[06:55] Bitcoin maximalist and you will get only
[06:57] in Bitcoin uh with with ucation with
[07:00] time I respect and accept that there are
[07:02] other people and they are in in crypto
[07:04] and and doing stuff I I I choose not to
[07:07] do that but I think it's fair that they
[07:09] here yeah this is interesting you just
[07:12] said I I wouldn't then call it like my
[07:14] personal opinion I don't necessary like
[07:17] uh us being toxic or others being toxic
[07:20] and of course it's everyone's life and
[07:22] their own hands but I believe again if
[07:25] you understand the mechanism actually
[07:27] actually the genius behind bcoin and how
[07:30] that money is literally your time and
[07:32] energy right if you are toxic you're
[07:34] kind of like losing it so instead of um
[07:38] let's say wasting your time and energy
[07:41] on being toxic you can convert this
[07:43] energy and time into something that is
[07:46] more positive but what I like and really
[07:48] appreciate or respect um and I would
[07:52] like not to see disappear anytime it's
[07:55] it's being conservative in in some some
[07:57] ways um so there is difference between
[08:00] being toxic attacking and also very
[08:03] often leaving in your own bubble versus
[08:05] being in some cases more conservative
[08:07] meaning okay I stick to my values I am
[08:10] consequent and um and I'm more critical
[08:15] let's say um when it comes to Novelties
[08:19] so it's kind of also related to this
[08:21] longtime preference okay I just don't
[08:23] jump to the water immediately right um
[08:26] so yeah this is how I kind of see being
[08:29] conservative in a healthy way of course
[08:31] because you know the world is uh built
[08:33] on the balance so you can have a scale
[08:35] from let's say 1 to 10 and you can be
[08:37] very hardcore um conservative which is
[08:40] also in my opinion not healthy so yeah I
[08:42] believe in the balance so everything has
[08:44] to be balanced in a healthy way and very
[08:46] often if we are doing mistakes is even
[08:48] good because we can learn from it but
[08:50] yeah
[08:51] and you can decide on your own on on how
[08:54] much you can be from one to 10 on the
[08:56] scale of of stuff but I I think um it
[08:59] should be be more less Balano in a
[09:00] healthy way than in a healthy way that
[09:02] doesn't hurt anyone around you and
[09:04] yourself as well do you think that bit
[09:07] Community is too toxic oh I I don't
[09:09] think so honestly this is one of the
[09:12] greatest uh communities because it's
[09:15] huge and I don't know everyone one of
[09:16] the greatest communities that is really
[09:19] Pure Energy um and it's so um diverse uh
[09:23] and it's
[09:24] so empowering and full of Hope and and
[09:27] so much talent and creativity and so
[09:30] many different experiences and it's very
[09:32] very interesting but of course there
[09:34] might be some individuals that are toxic
[09:38] um and it's not me to judge them it's me
[09:41] to decide if I want to be surrounded by
[09:43] them or exposed or not that's that's
[09:46] very true um let's go back to uh you
[09:49] worked in the banking industry you
[09:51] worked with with with uh trade fire and
[09:54] those things it's really interesting for
[09:56] me for people that were already in that
[09:58] world they have deeper view on that and
[10:01] they know better what's wrong with the
[10:03] Fiat system than people that didn't
[10:05] experience that firsthand so you you I
[10:08] think you described it before like
[10:09] disgusting with the with the trade fire
[10:12] and with with the bank system and that
[10:14] it group is even more discussing in that
[10:16] uh what's what's wrong with the field
[10:18] system what's wrong in your uh view with
[10:21] that
[10:22] system sorry um I think the biggest
[10:26] problem is that people who are operating
[10:29] within the system are not even aware or
[10:32] they don't understand how it works and
[10:34] it's really like one huge scam um that
[10:37] somebody decided on and keeps it running
[10:40] for their own profits um and many people
[10:43] and this is what I also saw in in the
[10:45] banking industry people who are working
[10:47] in there they don't even fully
[10:48] understand the mechanisms um they don't
[10:51] know the basics they don't even know the
[10:53] history I mean come on Fiat we are very
[10:55] often saying Fiat money it's much like
[10:58] it's not only the 19 uh you know when
[11:00] the gold gold standard was removed we
[11:02] have a history there was a ancient Rome
[11:04] there was the first money I think issued
[11:06] by China or somewhere in in Asia there
[11:09] are so many lessons to learn and and
[11:11] it's a very similar pattern and people
[11:12] these days working inside in there they
[11:14] don't realize that it doesn't make sense
[11:17] that there will be no retirements what's
[11:19] inflation how all these things are just
[11:21] using others and this is like a true
[11:23] Ponzi scheme so back in 2017 or 18 when
[11:28] I was working in one of
[11:29] company so to say and Bitcoin was
[11:31] already a topic especially because of
[11:33] the block size were you know like quite
[11:35] a big headline and the price was going
[11:37] up so people were saying oh this is
[11:38] Ponzi scheme come on you are working in
[11:41] a Ponzi scheme in all the possible means
[11:43] and you don't even understand how it
[11:45] works um also maybe if an interesting
[11:47] thing um we had in one one of this um um
[11:53] experience we had visits from the
[11:55] European Central Bank and the guy was
[11:57] giving us presentations how digital Euro
[12:00] how amazing it will be also saying that
[12:02] there will be no banks and everyone was
[12:04] clapping and I was thinking like what's
[12:06] wrong with you people the GU is
[12:07] literally saying that you are not needed
[12:10] and you lose your jobs and you are still
[12:12] clapping because it's cool you don't
[12:13] even understand but yeah speaking about
[12:15] the Fiat as money um it is just roten
[12:18] you know like the the entire system how
[12:21] it's built and designed and and I think
[12:23] it's such a big bubble that either it
[12:25] has to just collapse itself uh or it
[12:28] will continue to be worse and worse
[12:30] worse and worse and maybe naturally die
[12:32] but if not Bitcoin there will be some
[12:34] other people issuing some other type of
[12:36] money I don't even want to talk about
[12:38] cdbc is the biggest evil ever uh which
[12:41] is another threat possible to happen but
[12:43] it's just rotten it's like yeah one huge
[12:47] scam yeah C this is interesting the
[12:50] digital Euro uh I made actually yes like
[12:53] yesterday like the uh right before the
[12:55] this episode is is an episode around
[12:58] cbdcs and why is and someone actually
[13:00] working with banks uh they're Consulting
[13:03] them and they're trying to Orange build
[13:05] Banks and uh because like they see also
[13:08] cbdcs as a major threat for banks not
[13:10] only for uh for for our freedom but also
[13:14] for the freedom of the of the banks yeah
[13:17] you mean like commercial Banks and and
[13:19] uh like different than the Central Bank
[13:21] yeah because um but but you see this is
[13:23] another thing that when we are saying
[13:24] Banks many people they don't even know
[13:26] how all these institutions operate many
[13:29] um let's say an average Joe doesn't even
[13:32] know that there is something like
[13:33] Central Bank who is responsible for
[13:34] issuing money um Distributing it so this
[13:37] is also like a huge lack of knowledge
[13:39] and what I experience even people
[13:41] working in the sector they don't really
[13:44] understand how it works so yeah how
[13:46] would you describe uh this Fiat Ponzi
[13:49] scheme this Central Bank and Commercial
[13:52] Bank system in in in simple terms to
[13:54] someone that is an average show and is
[13:57] like oh like why is it
[13:59] Ponzi Ponzi scheme because um I don't
[14:02] know if it will be easy and and you know
[14:04] like it's hard to say for an every Joe
[14:07] if you don't spend some time with an
[14:09] every Joe to understand what kind of
[14:11] problems he might have and what kind of
[14:13] examples um or analogies can uh resonate
[14:17] with him right but let me put it this
[14:18] way um some group of powerful people
[14:21] decides to issue something they call
[14:24] money money is literally um a mean or it
[14:28] doesn't have to be even a physical thing
[14:30] because money is literally time and
[14:32] energy so in theory for your work or
[14:34] your effort I could pay you giving you
[14:36] breath and some time to rest right but
[14:38] let's say I can issue a physical I think
[14:40] we call money if the two of us agree to
[14:43] exchange it and if it has any value
[14:44] because somebody else can accept it uh
[14:47] so that you can get something from them
[14:49] let's say purchase it works as money so
[14:52] some very powerful people decide that
[14:55] they are going to issue a piece of paper
[14:57] C money and and they decide what's the
[15:01] value of it how much worth it has H and
[15:04] who gets it first so while issuing I
[15:07] mean like printing it also adding
[15:08] numbers because many of these things are
[15:10] digital now and many people also don't
[15:12] use cash anymore so who can have access
[15:16] and who can get more access to it um and
[15:19] because of this over printing or over
[15:21] production of this thing it's naturally
[15:23] losing value so if you have millions of
[15:25] the same items they are not that unique
[15:28] and um yeah I mean it's a more
[15:30] complicated topic of how the economy
[15:32] works but if you have more of something
[15:35] is less unique so naturally it's losing
[15:38] its value so your purchasing power so
[15:41] what you can get for that is also
[15:43] getting lower but on the other hand
[15:44] there are some people who get almost for
[15:46] free a lot of incentives and power being
[15:49] very close to this issuer so yeah you
[15:52] are losing you have kind of like a
[15:54] vicious circle almost impossible to get
[15:56] out uh and somebody consciously is
[15:59] keeping playing this kind of game that's
[16:00] game I said ponis game keeping you first
[16:03] of all by regulations obliged to use and
[16:06] to be there on the other hand yeah it's
[16:08] it's definitely a complicated topic it's
[16:10] also the the the one obvious thing for
[16:13] me is always the credit score that's
[16:15] basically
[16:17] um it it's it's when you have a pyramid
[16:20] scheme or like a Ponzi scheme there's
[16:23] always uh lines of production and the
[16:26] first one on the higher up on the Ponzi
[16:29] scheme the lower the cost of something
[16:32] is whatever the item of the Ponzi scheme
[16:35] is it's for example if you're selling
[16:36] energy drinks the one on the top becomes
[16:40] the energy drinks for 10 cents sells it
[16:41] for 12 cents to the next layer sells it
[16:44] for 14 cents to the next layer yeah and
[16:47] in in the Fiat system for me that item
[16:50] is is just credit and just the money and
[16:52] the cost of money is basically um the
[16:56] the the credit score or the interest
[16:57] rate what you paying for for making
[17:00] money which is an absurd thing that we
[17:02] can make money but but if if we are
[17:05] agreed to that then it's
[17:08] like the the high up you are and like
[17:11] Central Bank and there are banks and
[17:13] there are governments and there are big
[17:14] corporations then they're like high netw
[17:17] worth individuals and then we come
[17:19] slowly slowly to the average show uh and
[17:21] they're paying different rates like big
[17:23] corporations can maybe lend out money
[17:25] for like 1% or
[17:27] 0.1% and
[17:29] average show has to pay like 5% 10%
[17:32] consumer credits like 20% yeah
[17:34] absolutely and this average showe is
[17:36] already kind of Born Into dep um because
[17:39] this is our reality so it's again this
[17:42] Vicious Circle you have almost zero
[17:45] chance as long as you stay in the system
[17:46] to go out so it's also very luring or
[17:50] like um yeah cheating your brain because
[17:53] through credit you have a feeling that
[17:55] you can afford more and and these kind
[17:57] of conversations I used to have a lot
[17:58] with with my friends um that you know
[18:01] people these days they think they are
[18:04] richer than their parents and
[18:05] grandparents and they don't see that the
[18:08] amount of time they spend to earn some
[18:10] money let's say in the past somebody had
[18:12] to work I don't know five years to be
[18:14] able to afford a house or a car right in
[18:17] theory through the technology we should
[18:19] be able to produce these things cheaper
[18:21] and and faster so they should be more
[18:22] affordable but on the other hand now you
[18:25] have to work 50 years I mean to buy an
[18:27] apartment a house or whatever of course
[18:29] different countries different price but
[18:30] you have to like pay I don't know marage
[18:32] 20 50 years and it's still giving people
[18:37] because of credit cards because of in
[18:39] theory access to to many cool things and
[18:41] then like this uh more um short-term
[18:44] perspective and and like this um yeah
[18:47] reality that you think you own the world
[18:49] and the progress you kind
[18:51] of you are cheated your brain is cheated
[18:53] that you think yeah it's it's greater
[18:55] you don't you don't see that you are
[18:57] within every almost year shrinking your
[19:00] own reality and and and your future more
[19:03] and more so it's all like that
[19:05] completely it's not even about taking
[19:07] credit even if you don't take a specific
[19:09] credit from the bank you are already end
[19:11] them you your kids and and their kids
[19:13] it's interesting the the think about
[19:15] that you also wrote an article uh around
[19:18] how we living in The Matrix and and
[19:20] Matrix is a great comparison to uh to
[19:23] bitcoin like how did you make that
[19:26] analogy okay cool uh thanks for for
[19:29] reading it um I mean metrix is I think
[19:33] or metrix Trilogy is something that's
[19:36] hardly like everyone knows it right uh
[19:38] there are some people who are huge fans
[19:40] but it's very difficult to find somebody
[19:42] who doesn't know um the title and then
[19:45] especially in the Bitcoin world we are
[19:46] using this analogy to to The Matrix very
[19:49] often like exit The Matrix see through
[19:51] like um free yourself take the orange
[19:54] pill like very similar to Mor did to to
[19:57] Neo in a movie but what I realize is
[19:59] actually when we talk about it as
[20:01] bitcoiners sometimes for Outsiders it
[20:03] might sound kind of scary and as far as
[20:06] there are many similarities between our
[20:09] reality being like completely freed
[20:11] thanks to beatcoin a freeth thinkers
[20:13] Freedom Fighters there are many
[20:15] similarities to to this movie I actually
[20:17] realized that there are more differences
[20:19] and we should maybe talk about these
[20:21] differences because we are not like I
[20:23] don't know if did you watch Matrix or
[20:25] because yes I watched the first one like
[20:27] I'm only the first one ah really okay so
[20:30] personally I only didn't like the the
[20:32] last one um but I'm a huge fan so you
[20:35] know in the for anyone who who didn't
[20:37] watch it or watch it long time ago
[20:39] people who left the system that is
[20:42] oppressing its citizens and like kind of
[20:44] like soaking them even um to let itself
[20:47] to to keep alive like to keep the system
[20:50] alive so people who left it they were
[20:52] kind of like constantly stress and they
[20:54] were really like hiding uh in some
[20:57] crappy places and and they were all the
[20:59] time uh forced to to fight back and then
[21:02] they didn't have any like nice hopeful
[21:04] future and this is actually a huge
[21:06] difference between um let's say Bitcoin
[21:10] based world or or Bitcoin um St like
[21:13] world we are thriving I mean we are not
[21:16] people who are hiding and and all the
[21:18] time stress of course we might have some
[21:20] smaller or bigger fight though we also
[21:23] say that Bitcoin is a peaceful
[21:24] Revolution we don't need to like
[21:25] literally directly fight we are building
[21:27] a parallel reality that is really like
[21:30] beautiful and and it's completely
[21:32] opposite to what was shown in in in this
[21:34] movie so I wrote it because I wanted to
[21:36] remind us that even if we like something
[21:38] like myself movie we should always read
[21:41] in between lines and stop talking and
[21:44] thinking about it from one perspective
[21:46] because I do believe that critical
[21:47] thinking and thinking for ourselves is
[21:49] very important B I wanted to remind us
[21:53] that when we talk exit The Matrix maybe
[21:55] to um um Outsider we should also show
[21:58] that yeah if you exit the Matrix let's
[22:01] say using Bitcoin you you leave the
[22:04] system it's not like in the movie you
[22:05] will actually be happier like you will
[22:08] finally see the world and and and you
[22:10] will be full of Hope and and you will
[22:12] participate in one of the most uh
[22:15] impressive things I believe in a human
[22:17] history like really building a parallel
[22:19] reality that is it's the only hope I I
[22:23] kind of see these days um knowing
[22:25] everything I know about geopolitics and
[22:27] and problems with with money and all the
[22:29] craziness of the fat world
[22:32] yeah it's uh that that's really
[22:34] interesting what what you said with
[22:37] showing people how it is to be a
[22:39] bitcoiner I think that's the the most
[22:41] efficient way to Orange peill someone is
[22:45] if a bitcoiner in his surroundings is
[22:48] living a really good life if he's just a
[22:51] happy successful person uh and he sees
[22:54] that oh he lives on a Bitcoin standard
[22:56] and he says like oh like a lot of myone
[22:58] success a lot of my happiness comes from
[23:01] having sound money that's the orange
[23:03] pill everyone needs like they're like oh
[23:06] he he's doing great like I want to see
[23:08] why he doy you are healthy you are uh
[23:12] yeah this is the like the the example uh
[23:16] to others of course they need to know
[23:18] that you were in Bitcoin but maybe just
[23:19] be a happy healthy person and then
[23:21] somebody will come and ask you why and
[23:22] then you can say thanks to bitcoin
[23:24] thanks to this so we yeah we we
[23:26] shouldn't um and I believe every has
[23:28] their own stage I've been also there
[23:30] that yeah um I wanted to tell everyone
[23:33] the entire world around how great
[23:35] Bitcoin is and why they should learn
[23:36] about it and and stuff I I I quck that
[23:39] moment and I'm just in a stage like yeah
[23:41] I just do what I can I I love everything
[23:44] I'm doing actually um and people know
[23:47] that if they need questions if they need
[23:50] answers they can come to me even if I
[23:51] will not be able to answer some stuff I
[23:54] am kind of let's say well connected in
[23:56] the community I can point them out to I
[23:58] a resource a resource or another person
[24:00] so I'm not going to them anymore I'm
[24:04] just there waiting if somebody needs
[24:07] needs me I'm I'm I'm available yeah
[24:10] really cool um what are some of the
[24:13] similarities to The Matrix movie what
[24:15] are why why are people uh giving Matrix
[24:18] such a Bitcoin movie whyp I I think by
[24:21] the way there are more movies in that
[24:23] Matrix is just one of the most popular I
[24:25] also wrote an article about it like
[24:27] through more show death Poet Society
[24:30] equilibrium uh many of them but why
[24:33] Matrix I think because first of all it
[24:35] is um from the technical perspective how
[24:38] the movie was done in 90s it's just like
[24:41] classic is a legend but the similarities
[24:43] are yeah you are living in a system that
[24:46] is really parasitic and it's using you
[24:48] so people there that didn't watch the
[24:50] movie they were connected to some kind
[24:51] of machines and their energy was drained
[24:54] to make the system operating so actually
[24:57] our entire system the Fiat um system a
[25:01] Fiat based system is and culture is
[25:03] exactly working the same way so you are
[25:05] um like really living in a cog from the
[25:09] very beginning the moment you are born
[25:11] like even giving examples you go to
[25:13] school it's programming you and already
[25:16] making you to think in a specific way
[25:18] and you start this kind of path there
[25:19] was somewhere a very interesting meme
[25:21] showing this kind of Journey from school
[25:23] to to University work so you are already
[25:26] born into that like in The Matrix you
[25:28] are connected to this machine your
[25:30] energy is drained to make this system
[25:33] work so this system makes you like needs
[25:36] you so that is soaking your your power
[25:39] to stay alive I I think this is one of
[25:41] the biggest similarities and also
[25:44] another similarity is that many people
[25:46] are not aware that it even exists this
[25:49] is also one of the points in the plot of
[25:51] this trilogy but there are some people
[25:54] who do understand that it's all fake but
[25:57] they still prefer to stay in there for
[26:00] the comfort convenience so all the fancy
[26:02] words that we hear a lot in the
[26:04] mainstream media um so yeah there are
[26:06] many similarities it's actually a very
[26:09] genius um genius story especially
[26:12] considering it's that
[26:14] old yeah and it would be interesting to
[26:17] have like a a Bitcoin movie around the
[26:19] Matrix like a a matrix them Bitcoin
[26:22] movie that would be I would love that to
[26:25] see you know uh I think it was guys one
[26:28] he reworked a few scenes or one scene
[26:32] sorry from Matrix later I can send you
[26:34] the link so he just replaced um the
[26:38] dialogue between Neo and morphus giving
[26:41] some kind of like more Bitcoin oriented
[26:44] topic and it still Feats and it's
[26:45] amazing and now with all this AI film
[26:48] making I think um it's only the let's
[26:51] say the only limit is our imagination
[26:53] what can be done and created so yeah but
[26:55] it will be pretty cool yes that's really
[26:58] cool um you mentioned also Truman Show I
[27:01] I love that movie a lot like I I watched
[27:03] it uh I think already like two three
[27:05] times uh and it's a it's a it's a movie
[27:08] that like I don't know I think like 10
[27:10] years or five years ago I don't know how
[27:13] long ago but I think at least like four
[27:15] or five years ago that I watched it the
[27:16] first time I don't know even when it
[27:18] came out um but that's a that's a really
[27:21] really cool movie uh to look at and then
[27:25] the first time the last time I looked it
[27:27] at was a Bitcoin already and I was like
[27:29] oh that makes sense as a Bitcoin movie I
[27:32] was like that that I never appeared to
[27:34] me before that it was a Bitcoin movie so
[27:36] a lot of people actually watch the
[27:38] movies and they they never come Bitcoin
[27:40] in the mind and then all of the sudden
[27:42] you watch those things and anytime
[27:44] something comes up like that you're like
[27:46] oh Bitcoin yeah absolutely of course
[27:49] this is a topic of uh how much let's say
[27:52] or
[27:54] knowledge in understanding of Bitcoin
[27:56] it's impacting what you see so how much
[27:59] it's kind of like bias and your brain is
[28:02] trying to to give you the message that
[28:04] you see Bitcoin almost everywhere versus
[28:06] how much more aware you are of the
[28:08] things that's why you can understand
[28:10] some content um from different
[28:12] perspective so it's I think like to it's
[28:15] it's is very complex and complicated and
[28:18] sometimes we can see Bitcoin in almost
[28:20] everything or sometimes we notice things
[28:22] that are resonating with the Bitcoin
[28:24] ethos culture and the culture that is
[28:28] opposite to to um the Bitcoin
[28:31] ethers better now because we were not
[28:34] aware of many things so thanks to
[28:35] bitcoin it's not only like the knowledge
[28:37] of financial knowledge but it can be
[28:39] also history it can be politics it can
[28:42] be trouble it can be like so many
[28:44] different topics there are many
[28:45] different rabbit holes So within this
[28:46] whole journey you are exploring more and
[28:48] more and more and you are more aware
[28:50] more so to say knowledgeable or W wiser
[28:53] so that that's why maybe you can notice
[28:55] some stuff and see them differently uh
[28:57] if if you watch my podcast already for
[28:59] more than two times you know how
[29:01] extremely passionate I am about self-
[29:04] custody and the first very very very
[29:07] important step to self custody is always
[29:11] getting yourself a hardware wallet and I
[29:14] have one for you here this is the
[29:16] Bitcoin only Edition from the bitbox my
[29:19] favorite single signature Hardware
[29:21] wallet on the market another really
[29:24] important piece of self- custody if you
[29:27] have a hardware wallet is the backup of
[29:29] the seat phrase and bitbox made the
[29:32] perfect solution to back up your seat
[29:34] phrase they made a reusable steel wallet
[29:38] check out that beauty it's durable and
[29:41] extremely heavy if I put it on the desk
[29:44] I seriously feel for my own table it's
[29:47] so so heavy and durable I love it this
[29:50] is where my seed phrase is secure go to
[29:54] bitbox Dos ss/ robobin to get your bit
[29:58] bit box and if you use code Robin you
[30:01] even get 5% off of your complete order
[30:05] and the next step is to really level up
[30:07] your sovereignty as an individual you
[30:10] have to have the most secure self-
[30:12] custody setup you have to secure your
[30:14] own devices you have to protect your
[30:18] privacy you have to set up an
[30:20] inheritance plan and depending on where
[30:22] you live you even want to have a plan B
[30:25] a citizenship where you can move in case
[30:28] something goes really really wrong and
[30:30] through all those steps the Bitcoin way
[30:32] is guiding you through step by step and
[30:35] if you visit the Bitcoin way.com
[30:38] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[30:41] minute free call to find out how you can
[30:44] level up your sovereignty and last but
[30:47] not least I have something completely
[30:49] new for you guys I partnered up with
[30:52] coin vigilante this is the most
[30:55] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[30:58] saw created by anyone look at that
[31:00] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[31:03] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[31:06] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[31:09] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[31:12] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[31:16] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[31:18] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[31:22] watch collections you have the date of
[31:24] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[31:28] there and of course also the block
[31:30] height and which Epoch we are currently
[31:33] in I love the level of detail they put
[31:36] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[31:39] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[31:41] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[31:44] love those watches so so much and I
[31:47] think the most uh the the common theme
[31:50] around it is always like there's
[31:52] somewhere along the line you fought
[31:56] critically like you thinking in a
[31:58] critical way and then you're waking up
[32:00] that's like the tuman show when he
[32:02] touched like the the wall of of of the
[32:05] of his world uh and he he were persisted
[32:09] and and went for it h but then also the
[32:12] The Matrix I think we all have that one
[32:15] scene where we like the he woke up from
[32:18] that uh that cell and I think that's the
[32:21] the major thing like critical thinking
[32:23] if you get people to actually think for
[32:26] themselves and and critical think then
[32:28] they they will wake up to the idea of of
[32:31] of Bitcoin do you also see like the the
[32:34] critical thinking as like a crisis in
[32:37] our current absolutely and critical uh
[32:40] doesn't mean to criticize everything
[32:42] critical to as you nicely pointed out to
[32:45] think for for for yourself and also to
[32:47] be a little bit more skeptical about
[32:49] things meaning don't buy any kind of
[32:51] Topic in a shallow way on the on the
[32:54] surface whatever is thrown your way so
[32:56] try to side on your own I always say
[32:59] like don't read the headlines or the
[33:01] news just collect information to build
[33:04] your own opinion so thinking overall we
[33:06] have a thinking crisis it it's not only
[33:08] critical thinking um but I think it's
[33:11] also maybe partially done on purpose
[33:14] maybe it's a cause again almost quote
[33:18] unquote natural cause of the reality we
[33:20] are living in the speed again the
[33:22] problem with money so everyone is uh you
[33:24] know like chasing something and and also
[33:27] the Mass consumption like huge topic we
[33:30] could probably discuss for hours but I
[33:32] think we have a crisis with thinking
[33:35] these days people
[33:36] are preferred to be having a convenient
[33:40] life that somebody decides for them
[33:42] somebody thinks for them H they don't
[33:44] need to do that
[33:46] anymore yeah that's that's true it's
[33:49] even dangerous like I we talked before
[33:53] about the teleprompter and I was not I I
[33:56] couldn't think of the word teleprompter
[33:58] and then I just use chat gbt and it's
[34:01] interesting because yes it makes it easy
[34:03] for people I was like just giving a chg
[34:06] hey can you tell me the word that is you
[34:08] can put it on on a camera and you can
[34:10] read stuff on it and chat you're
[34:13] probably thinking of a teleprompter uh
[34:15] but it prevented my own brain to think
[34:17] of the solution because teleprompter the
[34:19] word was in my head uh so like even
[34:22] those new tools and this was like just
[34:24] one very small example but these new
[34:26] tools like that we have a phone
[34:27] everywhere we can Google and and ask
[34:30] chpd about any anything that we want we
[34:32] don't have to just like sit down and
[34:34] think even if you're like in a in a
[34:37] friends group with like five people uh
[34:40] and like 20 30 years ago and if there
[34:43] would be some questions we would like
[34:45] discuss and and and and really think
[34:47] about stuff like that and now it's like
[34:49] oh yeah let's look it up on Google then
[34:50] we know the answer then we don't have to
[34:52] yeah but I think again coming back to
[34:55] critical thinking or being yourself well
[34:58] technology has always the the downside
[35:01] or dark side and the bright side so you
[35:04] see you know that what you did in theory
[35:07] can be something dangerous and knowing
[35:09] it and thinking about it it's a very
[35:11] good sign there is no harm my personal
[35:14] opinion not everyone has to agree but
[35:15] there is no harm in doing things faster
[35:18] even Sometimes using tools like AI to
[35:21] give you answers but still to keep in
[35:24] mind that this is only a tool not to
[35:27] trust it all 100% because very often uh
[35:30] I think that might be kind of an issue
[35:33] in the future people will be asking CH
[35:34] GTP and it can lie I mean literally I'm
[35:37] sometimes also using it um as a as a
[35:39] model like not I'm not talking CH GPB by
[35:41] the way there is a payer que I think
[35:44] there is a um AI tool I don't know if if
[35:47] you know it but you can pay insights for
[35:49] it so let's say as a model CH thep so it
[35:52] can lie so as long as you are aware that
[35:54] it's only a tool and it should make some
[35:56] of the stuff faster but this is not to
[35:58] replace your brain this is not to
[36:00] replace you as a human being and not
[36:03] something that you should be all the
[36:04] time depending on it's all good I mean
[36:07] computers cars in the past people were
[36:09] also saying that oh yeah cars are really
[36:11] bad thing invention right they were
[36:13] joking and come on it's it's helping us
[36:15] to to move faster um internet the same
[36:19] story for a while people and still
[36:21] probably some we're talking the same
[36:22] stuff about Bitcoin yeah so there is
[36:25] nothing wrong in using things and making
[36:28] progress and using this different
[36:30] technology to progress and to do things
[36:32] faster as long as they are only tools
[36:35] and if you keep it in mind if you don't
[36:37] depend 100% of these things uh meaning
[36:40] again think um it's fine why not you can
[36:45] save a lot of time you ask Trend GTP and
[36:47] you gave this interesting example that
[36:49] yeah in the past maybe people will be
[36:50] discussing stuff yes but on the other
[36:53] hand what I notice that the most
[36:55] interesting and very deep complex
[36:58] conversations are always happening when
[37:00] there are at least two three bitcoiners
[37:02] so we might not be asking and this let's
[37:04] say spending time on discussing you know
[37:06] what's teleprompter and and what's the
[37:08] name of this thing but we will get super
[37:10] deep discussions and complex topics
[37:12] about I don't know whatever uh astronomy
[37:15] related to the past history of some
[37:17] Asian civilization and whatever so you
[37:19] know it's just like again Balan right
[37:21] and yeah yeah I agree with that like
[37:24] it's it's overall enhancing us
[37:28] um and I think uh if if we use it right
[37:30] as you said like if we have if we use it
[37:32] as a tool and not a as a replacement for
[37:34] our brain yeah because I I don't think
[37:38] that Ai and and and technology is bad
[37:41] for Humanity it's just maybe bad for
[37:44] some humans uh because you can use even
[37:47] social media and podcasting on all those
[37:48] things really positively and learn with
[37:52] uh consuming the right podcast or like
[37:54] produce something uh and and make
[37:56] something the world or you can
[37:59] brainlessly scroll uh four five six s
[38:03] eight hours every day on on Tik Tok and
[38:05] and Instagram real so like you can use
[38:08] every technology with good and bad it's
[38:10] like the knife you can stab someone and
[38:13] it doesn't mean exactly the fact that
[38:15] you can draw doesn't make water
[38:17] something dangerous right it's also
[38:19] something that we need just to make a
[38:21] joke I mean we are living in a super
[38:23] super interesting times and in this
[38:25] sense if you use smart for your own
[38:29] let's say advantage in a way that you
[38:32] progress and and you can um learn there
[38:35] are really Sky Has No Limits I mean you
[38:37] don't need to anymore go and drive to
[38:40] school you can work from home I mean not
[38:42] work from home to be stuck at home
[38:43] because this is also one of the
[38:44] narratives I think they are trying to
[38:46] sell us so that we are uh not spending
[38:49] time with each other anymore and it's
[38:51] broader topic but being able to work
[38:54] remotely from wherever you want or
[38:56] having at least this um this um
[38:58] advantage that you can decide how you
[39:00] work where you work how fast you can
[39:02] learn different things you don't need to
[39:03] really like follow this um pattern o of
[39:06] the system like yeah go to this school
[39:08] try to go to this specific University to
[39:11] get this job like kind of like a you
[39:13] know blind path that is designed and the
[39:16] same way for everyone there is so many
[39:19] things now that you can literally learn
[39:21] explore and experience thanks to the
[39:23] technology you can also travel so fast
[39:25] look at the two of us we are discussing
[39:28] different stuff and then there's
[39:30] hopefully at least 100 other people who
[39:32] will listen to it later and then they
[39:34] can still engage with the two of us
[39:36] right so this is amazing I mean it's
[39:38] just all about how we are going to use
[39:40] it and yeah all about how how we are
[39:43] going to use it may don't just here
[39:45] that's interesting yeah um back to to
[39:48] bitcoin um what have what has changed in
[39:51] your life uh once Bitcoin was there was
[39:54] you already really changed before and
[39:57] Bitcoin was just a natural puzzle piece
[39:59] before or did did Bitcoin actually
[40:01] change something I like to my this joke
[40:03] that I was born as a
[40:05] bitcoiner and I'm for almost 40 years
[40:07] old so yeah quite it's connected to I
[40:11] like to say it this way because I think
[40:13] I was always like thinking for myself uh
[40:16] questioning uh being curious but not
[40:19] naive um to too naive let's say um my
[40:22] dad helped me to to have many different
[40:24] values that I see that they are common
[40:26] values or very popular values among
[40:29] bitcoiners and I think that actually it
[40:31] was not me who found Bitcoin but Bitcoin
[40:33] found like not me that I found Bitcoin
[40:35] but Bitcoin found me when I was mature
[40:38] enough to understand it fully because
[40:40] I've heard about it
[40:42] [Music]
[40:43] 2005ish kind of 2017 I can say that I
[40:46] was aware and that was the moment that I
[40:48] started my journey
[40:51] before I was not mature enough to put
[40:53] enough time so it was my personality
[40:57] getting
[40:58] smarter uh Stronger whatever we call it
[41:02] and then Bitcoin hit in a particular
[41:04] moment and I think I yeah if not Bitcoin
[41:06] if there would be something else than
[41:08] Bitcoin uh probably I would also follow
[41:10] it because um because of my my
[41:13] personality and and I think this is my
[41:15] opinion that it's something common we
[41:17] have with this curiosity thinking and
[41:20] the need to be independent like
[41:23] Sovereign we do have as a community as
[41:25] as bitcoiners that you have this kind of
[41:27] sparkk and it doesn't mean that in the
[41:29] future for example people will not be
[41:31] using Bitcoin there will be no Mass
[41:33] adoption because some people are using
[41:34] car not thinking how it works you don't
[41:36] I mean car is just a tool but there are
[41:38] also like car people who are fascinated
[41:40] and they understand it more so you know
[41:42] like bitcoiner in your mind and heart
[41:45] these people they have something
[41:47] specific naturally in them like from the
[41:50] moment they are born like yeah it's
[41:52] really interesting how do you think it's
[41:54] it's sometimes interesting like uh I
[41:56] feel like the the Bitcoin Community is
[41:58] really really really unique and in the
[42:02] properties they have and in what they
[42:04] doing what they are uh making out of
[42:06] themselves and sometimes I feel like
[42:08] we're just uh so unique because we're an
[42:11] early community and early communities
[42:13] always like really um you have to think
[42:16] really critical because otherwise you
[42:17] would not be in the early crowd um what
[42:20] do you think that Bitcoin and the sound
[42:23] money Revolution actually changes
[42:24] something in in society like is is the
[42:27] fact that we are exchanging feat money
[42:30] with now sound money with Bitcoin
[42:32] enhancing Society a very broad deep
[42:35] topic there is interesting book written
[42:37] by yni appleberg H it's called um
[42:41] abundance through scarcity that is more
[42:43] or less discussing different
[42:45] civilizations through their course of
[42:47] how they developed or naturally died and
[42:50] I think it's very hard to say how the
[42:51] future might look like if there would be
[42:54] something even like bitcoiners uh or
[42:56] Bitcoin f or Bitcoin art or something
[42:58] because it might be just natural thing
[43:00] and nobody will mention Bitcoin anymore
[43:01] it will be just the reality um it's hard
[43:04] to
[43:05] say or assume how it might look like in
[43:08] the future but on the other hand um and
[43:11] another great book The forth turning
[43:13] kind of like heavier to read but I
[43:15] believe in this natural kind of cause of
[43:18] yeah there is this saying times create
[43:20] weak men weak times create strong strong
[43:22] man so I think there are this circles
[43:24] and in theory it can even happen that
[43:26] when we are on the standard maybe
[43:28] because of human nature something will
[43:30] happen and then we will again have to
[43:32] restart and then refresh ourselves and
[43:35] and change the way of thinking so I just
[43:38] believe there are these kind of uh
[43:40] circles or turnings this is also kind of
[43:42] a reference to Matrix where the system
[43:44] was restart every time this in this
[43:46] meaning it's not like somebody build a
[43:47] system I don't believe somebody build a
[43:49] system that is designed for us that we
[43:50] have to stick in but I do believe that
[43:53] the world after maybe hundreds of years
[43:55] and and through all this complexity can
[43:58] change and evolve and and then restart
[44:00] itself so agree that it's very early and
[44:02] maybe us is a very specific group as B
[44:04] coiners the way we operate talk think
[44:07] and though we have similar barriers we
[44:08] are so completely different which is
[44:10] amazing but maybe in next 100 200 500
[44:14] years the circle or pattern will repeat
[44:16] because of something so if you know what
[44:18] I'm
[44:19] saying I think it's a a is a great one
[44:23] like it could it could actually be very
[44:27] fundamental to to our human beings it's
[44:29] it's I like how you also like look at it
[44:32] in that lens you also are as you said
[44:36] before and I never heard that one a
[44:38] naturally born Nomad so like I I asked
[44:41] you before if you're a digital Nomad and
[44:42] you're like no I'm a natural born Nomad
[44:44] like it's why do you describe it like
[44:47] that well uh not to bore you with my
[44:50] personal stories but I've been born in
[44:52] let's say Multicultural family and
[44:55] because of how my power parents were
[44:58] structuring their life already as a
[45:00] child I was dropped this house I had you
[45:02] know many different grandmas and
[45:04] grandpas and aunties and stuff and like
[45:07] I am the only child for example so it
[45:09] was actually good for me because I was
[45:11] always surrounded by people in different
[45:12] age for some time they were all my huge
[45:14] big family but it also forced me to be
[45:17] in different places and to adapt very
[45:19] quickly and I think it's also something
[45:21] of course it will work differently for
[45:23] everyone but I think this is also
[45:24] something that can spark this creativity
[45:26] and thinking because the same as travel
[45:29] not travel as a tourist but as a
[45:31] traveler can broaden your mind you can
[45:33] understand yourself better and others as
[45:36] well the same even as a kid not having
[45:38] one permanent place though you have a
[45:40] house but you are not spending that much
[45:42] time there and it's something normal um
[45:46] even if it's just 50 or 100 or 500
[45:48] kilometers from there right because we
[45:49] were not traveling the entire world but
[45:51] if you have this concept from the early
[45:53] age it's almost like troubling so I
[45:56] never had this thing like yeah I really
[45:58] have to like a tree put root somewhere
[46:00] maybe it will happen one day maybe I
[46:02] will stop my Gypsy life with some of my
[46:04] friends are saying but maybe not what I
[46:07] noticed is that there there are many
[46:10] advantages of it I am not collecting so
[46:13] many items because I have to be mobile
[46:15] that I'm am appreciating time with one
[46:17] of the most precious people in my life a
[46:19] my husband this is my home where he is
[46:22] is my home I don't also suffer that much
[46:25] uh where I have to leave some something
[46:27] I'm very curious and happy to be able to
[46:29] explore some stuff or go back to a
[46:31] country that I was spending uh some time
[46:34] in the past it's you can learn so much
[46:37] and and you can uh be more free right so
[46:41] I used to live this way as a kid uh not
[46:44] my own choice but I adopted I liked it
[46:47] and and still I'm kind of yeah as you
[46:48] see I I got the virus and I continue
[46:52] this way even as an adult you have an
[46:54] amazing energy I like it actually a lot
[46:56] I really cool um before we come to the
[46:58] end routine I'm I'm curious uh by the
[47:01] way I I love the I love moving around a
[47:04] lot right now I'm just like in my
[47:07] podcast studio in Vienna 247 in like
[47:10] those Fe walls four walls uh and it
[47:13] feels really right but I want to get to
[47:15] the place where I move around more and
[47:17] more uh and I just use uh now Bitcoin
[47:21] conferences to do it like I I will be in
[47:24] Amsterdam I might be in Lugano I will be
[47:27] definitely in in in El Salvador in in
[47:30] November so I use right now just Bitcoin
[47:33] conferences to move around a lot uh and
[47:37] uh the other time I'm just in my base
[47:38] and trying to get as many Bitcoin
[47:41] podcasts as possible around but but you
[47:44] see to to what you just said and again
[47:46] uh it's up to you what you want and what
[47:49] makes you happy because the disadvantage
[47:51] of my uh let's say now I'm just thinking
[47:55] critically about myself so this
[47:56] Advantage about my lifestyle is if there
[47:59] is in theory a huge crisis which can
[48:01] happen I need to rebuild my own Citadel
[48:04] from zero somewhere of course the
[48:05] advantages is and this is one of the
[48:08] reasons why we trouble because we want
[48:10] to see where to escape if something we
[48:11] want to have some closer relationships
[48:14] in this place that place and so on and
[48:15] so forth but uh if something happens you
[48:19] have your place that you are familiar
[48:21] with so it's very first of all you have
[48:22] more time to build your own Fortress or
[48:24] S let me put it this way to protect your
[48:26] s second um you know the surrounding
[48:31] better so you can even if it's at hog
[48:33] you can do it in the last moment for me
[48:35] it's more challenging so this might be
[48:37] disadvantage and some people they might
[48:38] just prefer to be more uh settled and
[48:42] because of many different reasons so
[48:43] there is not again like a perfect thing
[48:46] and yeah I want to mention it so that it
[48:48] doesn't sound like they're both
[48:49] promoting like being nans or gypsies uh
[48:52] because for some people it might be not
[48:54] interesting yeah it's it's you have to
[48:56] think about a lot uh I was thinking of
[48:58] getting into a more digital Nomad life
[49:01] uh but there's a lot of things to
[49:03] consider it's it has a great value for
[49:06] me in my life that I have my studio my
[49:09] home base where I can just like come
[49:11] here and make my podcast uh like there
[49:14] are like one on onof button where all my
[49:17] lights go on my microphone is working my
[49:19] camera is in a position where it's
[49:21] always is like those kind of
[49:23] conveniences are really great to be as
[49:25] efficient as possible possible and if I
[49:27] would move around a lot I would have to
[49:30] find out where's the best spot for the
[49:32] microphone where's the best spot for the
[49:33] camera and you have you have to adopt a
[49:36] lot exactly so there is never one side
[49:38] of the story and I think the most
[49:40] important is also maybe after some time
[49:43] it will change for me and it will also
[49:44] change for you I told you that yeah I'm
[49:47] naturely or I'm born nor but maybe and
[49:50] that's the beauty of life that we should
[49:53] actually evolve and and adopt we are not
[49:56] like like a you know permanent creature
[49:58] that is from the very beginning until
[50:01] you die H the same person actually
[50:03] people who are like this it's very said
[50:05] life to be honest so maybe if we talk I
[50:08] don't know in the next five 10 years you
[50:10] will be the N the Gypsy and I will be
[50:12] the one saying no it's great to be in
[50:14] one place so
[50:16] yeah it's possible it's it's it's
[50:18] entirely possible for me at
[50:22] least um let's see before we come to the
[50:24] end of team I want to get to know um
[50:27] what you are doing in the Bitcoin world
[50:29] you're involved with the Bitcoin Film
[50:31] Festival um what is that and maybe also
[50:34] what else are you doing yeah yeah thanks
[50:37] thanks for mentioning so biton Film Fest
[50:39] because this is a funnier name um or
[50:42] less less por name of Festival so
[50:45] filmfest is a bcoin filmfest is actually
[50:49] a year round project so from one side
[50:52] it's kind of like aiming to be um a
[50:54] dynamic Hub connecting people filmm
[50:56] Cinema fans Inspire to educate um and to
[51:01] like produce different content um around
[51:03] independent cinema and Bitcoin culture
[51:05] but not only uh movies focus on bitcoin
[51:08] as we both just discussed a few minutes
[51:10] ago there was Matrix trumman show so
[51:12] yeah uh and so it's yeah like like a
[51:15] platform and hub on the other hand it is
[51:17] a really a festival uh Film Fest film
[51:21] festival so it's not a conference it's a
[51:24] cultural event I would even say like um
[51:26] really community-driven uh cultural
[51:28] event it's happening yearly or annually
[51:31] in waro the capital of Poland and a very
[51:33] interesting building there is a story
[51:35] behind it it was um gift from Uncle
[51:38] Stalin and now it's like a rebel base
[51:41] you know screening independent cinema
[51:42] quite often talking about Bitcoin and
[51:44] hosting couple of hundred of bitcoiners
[51:45] so it's pretty cool so yeah once a year
[51:48] it's happening as a festival uh we also
[51:50] did couple of this uh we say um mini
[51:53] mini editions so like Road shows uh
[51:56] trying to organize some screenings when
[51:58] there are other conferences happening so
[52:00] what you said you're going to Lugano
[52:02] this year so last year we were also
[52:04] cooperating with Lugano adopting Bitcoin
[52:06] is also our friend so we were doing
[52:08] stuff um this year I don't know if we
[52:11] will have time but for example Alana uh
[52:14] she will be screening her movie in in
[52:16] Salvador very good one dirty coin so um
[52:19] can recommend everyone who is going to
[52:21] to adopting bcoin to watch it so yeah we
[52:23] we do couple of different things I would
[52:25] say quite a lot considering that a it's
[52:28] not a full-time project paid it's
[52:31] nonprofit and it's just a small group of
[52:33] us friends who is running it activist so
[52:36] it's quite a lot actually with what we
[52:39] are doing yeah but the aim is literally
[52:42] to to help to build this independent
[52:44] kind of or par par difficult one so the
[52:48] alternative way of of um Cinema industry
[52:51] because this is also like coming back to
[52:53] the theat culture it's a very strong
[52:55] medium that can and program you uh and
[52:58] it's also limiting creators and it's
[53:00] again a vicious circle because the more
[53:02] limits there are the specific content
[53:04] the more of a specific content is
[53:05] produced and then it's programming you
[53:07] in some specific way blah blah blah and
[53:09] so on uh so that's why we we kind of
[53:12] almost naturally we didn't create this
[53:14] space we just saw that it's it's there
[53:17] it it needs support uh help and we just
[53:20] made what what we did and our aim is to
[53:23] yeah help all these um independent
[53:25] creators um produce their content access
[53:28] more people and also Cinema fans very
[53:30] often people are not watching stuff
[53:32] because they are already bored with the
[53:33] seventh version of Spider-Man or
[53:36] whatever kind of weird narratives um so
[53:38] we want to give them fresh content um
[53:41] yeah that can resonate with bitcoiners
[53:43] not only plus it of course will educate
[53:45] a lot of people about bcoin as well so
[53:47] yeah this is long story short about
[53:50] bcoin fil Fest there are definitely too
[53:52] many Spider-Man movies out there I can't
[53:54] even count them it's like yeah
[53:56] Spider-Man one 12 three homecoming and
[53:58] stuff like that I don't even follow
[54:00] anymore so yeah but I know more I think
[54:03] I watched the first three uh actually
[54:06] but then where it's got to crazy with
[54:08] homecoming and uh like three four few
[54:11] others ones uh I I was like no no uh
[54:15] Iron Man I was also really big fan of
[54:18] like there are some great movies but
[54:19] it's it's interesting do do you think
[54:21] that that Fiat world uh is kind of
[54:24] incentivizing uh those weird movies
[54:27] sometimes those like virtual signaling
[54:31] movies yes yes I mean it might be seen
[54:34] or understood as a conspiracy theories
[54:36] by others up to them uh I think whatever
[54:38] you want I will be actually happy to
[54:40] discuss uh this with whoever things
[54:43] differently but I do think is a part of
[54:45] the system I'm not saying it was built
[54:46] this way on purpose though might be uh
[54:49] Hollywood and the first movies and all
[54:51] this I also wrote a couple of articles
[54:52] about it very interesting story Daniel
[54:54] Prince is actually a very um cool person
[54:56] to discuss the stuff he he likes all
[54:58] this rabbit holes the movie industry is
[55:00] also something he couple of times
[55:03] mentioned but I think it is something
[55:06] that is on purpose selling us specific
[55:08] narratives so that we
[55:11] are uh craving more we are um more
[55:15] stressed so this is always analogy I
[55:17] give to people look you are watching all
[55:18] these Hollywood stars great lives in
[55:21] some specific movie series and stuff so
[55:23] in theory potentially you w you do it
[55:26] because you want to relax because your
[55:27] life is already stressful and you are
[55:29] chasing and chasing and chasing so you
[55:30] are going to the theater or you watch
[55:32] something at home to relax but at the
[55:34] end of the day because there are so many
[55:36] different um stimulants or like um
[55:39] hidden stories your brain knows it so
[55:41] you are actually more stress which you
[55:43] don't realize so then you keep consuming
[55:45] even more of these kind of things so
[55:46] this is just one one of the examples on
[55:48] the other hand there are many different
[55:50] weird narratives that are sold to us in
[55:52] so many different ways movie industry is
[55:55] one of the easiest to to to use uh for
[55:58] for masses so it's done on purpose uh
[56:01] very often plus if you are excluding
[56:04] let's say critical thinkers when it
[56:06] comes to creators uh if you kind of kill
[56:08] and sensor their creativity uh and if
[56:11] they are not incentivized enough
[56:13] obviously even smart people will start
[56:16] producing kind of crop or trash so to
[56:18] say uh because it sells so it's a very
[56:21] complex uh huge mechanism actually
[56:24] similar uh to Mafia I would say it can
[56:28] it can do a lot of
[56:30] harm the the fear feared Mafia had Capt
[56:34] everywhere yeah literally I mean yes
[56:38] yes really good um perfect then let's
[56:41] come to the end of team as we're already
[56:43] over one hour or close to one hour um
[56:45] what can we learn from you besides all
[56:48] the things that we already talked about
[56:50] let me bring back this thing about
[56:52] critical thinking and thinking for
[56:54] yourself um
[56:56] I would actually leave answer to this to
[56:59] everyone who will listen to this episode
[57:01] we were discussing directly many
[57:03] different things but it's up to you who
[57:05] you would what you want to learn from me
[57:08] from topics or words that we just
[57:11] Exchange in this conversation so let me
[57:13] put it this way a little bit
[57:15] philosophical yeah think yourself and if
[57:18] somebody wants to learn later or discuss
[57:20] something directly they can always reach
[57:22] out to me uh through many different
[57:24] channels yeah it's it's it's it's
[57:26] interesting that's I really I love that
[57:29] answer a lot never never came up that
[57:32] that perspective of that answer even
[57:34] though that's that's one question I
[57:36] always ask my guests the different the
[57:38] other end routine is where the previous
[57:40] guest is always asking a question for
[57:42] the next guest without knowing who the
[57:43] next guest actually is so that comes
[57:45] from a previous guest uh how can we
[57:48] accelerate the Bitcoin lightning adop oh
[57:50] I think uh Noster protocol is helping um
[57:54] us to achieve this Mission so I would
[57:56] say go to Noster and know and remember
[57:59] that it's well beyond social media it's
[58:01] not only clients as Damas am and Primal
[58:04] list most of the people think it's a
[58:06] protocol so there are uh blogging
[58:08] platforms streaming platforms thousands
[58:10] of I mean not thousands but a lot of
[58:11] different tools so I think this is how
[58:13] we can help uh lightning um adoption
[58:17] also um to ask from time to time
[58:19] different people if they are accepting
[58:21] let's say in real life if they are
[58:22] accepting Bitcoin and then mention that
[58:24] there is something as Lightning Network
[58:26] it's actually interesting because many
[58:27] bitcoiners the old school bitcoiners
[58:30] they don't even know that lightning
[58:32] exists and they still want to transact
[58:33] on CH which is kind of like interesting
[58:36] uh talk about it learn if you have some
[58:38] skills to contribute in a technical way
[58:40] do that um so and most important most
[58:44] important just use it use it whenever
[58:46] you can and the many different ways um
[58:49] we are already like comparing to 2017 I
[58:52] can say say set in a way that it's easy
[58:56] to use Bitcoin to give it to earn it to
[58:59] get it back to yeah going back to Noster
[59:02] to zap others I meaning show some small
[59:05] appreciation I mean microtransactions
[59:07] this is just like mindblowing so yeah
[59:10] but I would say uh Noster is helping us
[59:12] a lot here a lot absolutely yeah thank
[59:16] you so much uh you already mentioned
[59:18] that people can reach out to you uh
[59:20] where are your channels what is the best
[59:22] way to to reach out to you okay so um
[59:25] yeah oh I mostly mentioned here like
[59:27] Bitcoin Film Festival but there is also
[59:29] another project I I run uh with with my
[59:31] husband like my baby project it's a
[59:33] Bitcoin Junior Club so it's a space for
[59:35] families kids and teams so they can
[59:38] reach out to me there if they are
[59:39] interested in in these kind of topics
[59:41] they can reach out to me and US overall
[59:44] through bcoin filmfest Noster telegram
[59:46] for both of these projects uh my social
[59:50] channels are less active um you can find
[59:52] me on Noster as AA uncore
[59:56] and then you should already see um the
[59:58] rest so AA to be myself I believe this
[60:01] is my handle um you can find me on
[60:04] Simplex telegram email I mean if you
[60:06] want you will find me and I believe uh
[60:09] we can put a link or two um in the uh
[60:13] notes under the show so yeah absolutely
[60:16] I always leave uh one contact link for
[60:19] every guest uh so like in for General uh
[60:22] because I still get that question in the
[60:25] comments oh how can I reach out to him
[60:27] like on every podcast on every episode
[60:29] there's at least one link uh down the
[60:31] description where you can find uh the
[60:34] guest uh even I had one guest on who who
[60:37] is not on social media at all like on on
[60:39] no one uh but he made a special a
[60:42] telegram Channel just for that podcast
[60:45] so people can actually ask him questions
[60:47] uh so like there's always a link down in
[60:49] the description with the um guest
[60:52] contact if
[60:54] I if I forget that uh I get reminded by
[60:58] a lot of comments usually so uh if it's
