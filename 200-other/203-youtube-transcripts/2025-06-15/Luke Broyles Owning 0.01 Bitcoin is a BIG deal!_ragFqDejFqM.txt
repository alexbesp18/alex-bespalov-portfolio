[00:00] if you have half a Bitcoin you're going
[00:01] to have more money than you can imagine
[00:02] the average poor person in 2060 is going
[00:04] to be way richer than the average poor
[00:06] person in 2025 most people would never
[00:08] have a million STS look at the people
[00:10] before you look at the people after you
[00:11] it's not even a question there's 300 to
[00:13] 500 times more people after you than
[00:15] before you and all of a sudden you
[00:16] realize you're not too late you're
[00:17] actually very early and you have way
[00:19] more in common with Michael sailor than
[00:20] you have in common with the average
[00:22] person 80% of the people watching the
[00:24] show could go to an airport and fly to
[00:26] any country in the world in Ancient real
[00:28] 2,000 years ago 99% of the world was
[00:31] Poor 500 years ago 96% of the world was
[00:34] poor 200 years ago 92% of the world was
[00:37] poor and then a 100 years ago like 85%
[00:39] of the world was poor and now 15% of the
[00:42] world is extremely poor making less than
[00:44] $2 a day power in Bitcoin is different
[00:47] than power in the Fiat system power in
[00:48] the Fiat system is who has most
[00:49] political currency power in Bitcoin is
[00:51] who has the most
[00:53] [Music]
[00:56] ideas we have currently the situation
[00:58] where a lot of wealth is in uh not a lot
[01:01] of hands of people like globally not in
[01:03] Bitcoin uh and most people are
[01:06] struggling do you think uh or how do you
[01:09] think will Bitcoin change that that uh
[01:12] most people are um rich or like most
[01:16] people are wealthy and only a handful of
[01:18] people are struggling that would be the
[01:20] the major outcome or maybe even like
[01:21] nobody struggles but I don't know if
[01:23] this is even reachable
[01:26] um that's something I think a good bit
[01:28] about because I think it's interesting
[01:30] and I think it's important um I think it
[01:32] just comes down to what
[01:34] is one's priority right if is one's
[01:38] priority to have equality or is one's
[01:41] priority to have the most wealth for the
[01:44] most number of people possible right um
[01:46] you know
[01:47] if even our own personal lives I think
[01:50] this is a big guiding question right if
[01:53] if my goal is to be the richest person
[01:56] that is a different goal than wanting to
[01:59] get richer right um you know it it might
[02:02] seem like a subtle goal or a relevant
[02:04] difference but I think it's pretty
[02:06] important because is a zero sum game
[02:10] right um and everyone getting wealthy is
[02:13] not a zero some game so you know let's
[02:14] take Michael sailor as you know the
[02:17] famous Infamous whatever example um of
[02:19] this in Bitcoin um you know Michael
[02:21] sailor is one of the whatever five
[02:24] biggest holders of Bitcoin micr strategy
[02:27] is definitely one of the five biggest
[02:29] you know in
[02:30] in Bitcoin but even Michael sailor
[02:31] personally is going to be one of the
[02:32] richest people in all of Bitcoin you
[02:34] know besides Toshi and maybe a handful
[02:36] of ogs um you know and
[02:39] so there's only so many spots at the top
[02:42] right like there's only 10 spots in the
[02:44] top 10 right and there's only one spot
[02:47] for the richest person in the world or
[02:49] the richest person in Bitcoin and so if
[02:50] someone's trying to become richer like
[02:52] you're inherently playing a zero SIM
[02:54] game like you can only have the ranking
[02:56] of order once um but everyone getting
[03:00] richer in Bitcoin is a different goal I
[03:02] think it's a better goal I think it's a
[03:04] goal that is one we tend to forget it's
[03:07] one that doesn't pray or doesn't take
[03:11] advantage of our human emotions right I
[03:12] think we're wired to prefer the former
[03:15] more than the letter I think we're wired
[03:17] to measure our own success not actually
[03:19] on how well we're doing but on how well
[03:21] relative to everyone else right like you
[03:23] and I having this conversation we're in
[03:25] two different countries and two
[03:26] different continents in two different
[03:28] time zones um you know at two different
[03:30] times of day and we're having this
[03:32] conversation real time via computers and
[03:35] the internet and everyone's watching
[03:36] this um in their own place in the world
[03:39] at their own preferred time and they're
[03:41] watching it anytime in the future maybe
[03:42] they're watching this conversation a
[03:44] week in the future or or a year in the
[03:46] future or 20 years in the future and so
[03:50] in absolute terms we're very rich but a
[03:53] lot of people today don't feel rich a
[03:54] lot of people more than ever I think
[03:56] feel quote unquote behind a lot of
[03:59] people feel behind a lot of people feel
[04:01] relatively poor a lot of people feel
[04:04] like life is getting worse and I think
[04:06] there's a very real legitimate reason
[04:08] for them to feel that
[04:09] because their savings is getting worse
[04:12] it is getting depleted but at the same
[04:14] time you know I think it's just a funny
[04:16] reality of human nature
[04:18] that
[04:20] people people would be happier I think
[04:23] having less wealth but being higher in
[04:26] the ranking than lower in the ranking
[04:29] and having more wealth wealth I've just
[04:30] seen that univers universally right just
[04:32] this year you know I've been around some
[04:34] wealthy people you even before Bitcoin
[04:36] I'd met some wealthy people a lot of
[04:38] them seem pretty happy a lot of them
[04:40] don't seem very happy uh you know I I've
[04:42] done various mission trips and and um
[04:45] you know travel in my life some places
[04:47] to very very poor places and you see the
[04:49] same thing there right when it comes to
[04:51] you know an impoverished Village or or
[04:54] town or or you know whatever um you know
[04:57] the people that have bricks are are the
[05:00] subject of Envy from people that you
[05:02] know don't have bricks right the person
[05:03] with um you know one kind of dirt and
[05:07] their house floor is preferred over
[05:09] somebody else right you know like it
[05:11] doesn't matter if we're talking about
[05:12] people with you know $1,000 dollar of
[05:14] wealth to the name or a billion dollars
[05:17] of wealth to the name I think you know
[05:19] the whole ranking game is what is the
[05:21] primary driver of people contining to
[05:24] get wealthy and so I guess my My Hope in
[05:26] saying this is also to help hopefully
[05:28] remind all of us including s that you
[05:30] know at a certain you know how do we
[05:32] measure success do we measure it based
[05:33] on comparing to someone else do we
[05:34] measure it based
[05:36] on um what our own personal goal is and
[05:39] so all I that to say I suppose is that I
[05:41] think this question of wealth inequality
[05:43] and how does Bitcoin change that I think
[05:45] we have to have with that context of
[05:47] what's the actual goal and so with that
[05:50] said I don't actually think wealth
[05:51] inequality inherently is a bad thing I
[05:54] don't actually think it's a bad thing I
[05:55] think it all comes down to how is wealth
[05:58] inequality created right is wealth INE
[06:01] equality created as a function of
[06:03] everybody using a given political
[06:04] currency and then I have my foot on the
[06:06] lever of that political currency
[06:07] benefiting myself at the expense of
[06:08] others that is wrong that is evil that
[06:11] is stealing uh that is inherently a zero
[06:13] some game and inherently wealth has to
[06:15] centralized right this is what we see
[06:17] with Bitcoin that or not with Bitcoin
[06:20] but this is what we see with the the
[06:22] political currency reality of today is
[06:26] money is centralizing because political
[06:28] power has to Central because political
[06:30] currency is centralizing and therefore
[06:32] you have to centralize information you
[06:33] have to centralize everything else in
[06:35] the world you have to centralize
[06:36] Medicine you have to centralized food
[06:38] everything else in the world Trends to
[06:40] centralization when the money itself is
[06:42] centralized and everyone's incentivized
[06:43] to do this the politicians are
[06:44] incentivized to do this because they
[06:46] they can't re in control of the loose
[06:49] ends of the currency if they can't
[06:51] control the information because money is
[06:52] information and if you had a free market
[06:55] in non-monetary information that would
[06:58] inherently be a a pressure on a monopoly
[07:02] of a political currency that is not a
[07:03] free market which is not and so you know
[07:06] I think that's what we see right now
[07:07] when it comes to wealth inequality and
[07:10] and sensualization is it's more of a
[07:12] cannibalistic wealth inequality you know
[07:14] and you know I don't know Robin how many
[07:17] of your listeners are Americans or not
[07:19] um but this is probably important
[07:21] historical side note um both for the
[07:23] Americans and the non-americans but in
[07:25] the Great Depression you know my
[07:26] grandmother was born in 1932 she's still
[07:29] alive
[07:30] and she was born in the Great Depression
[07:31] so this is something that you know some
[07:33] people alive still have a touch point to
[07:35] this but the Great Depression what was
[07:36] one of the reasons why it accelerated so
[07:38] much one of the reasons why was because
[07:42] of wealth inequality one of the reasons
[07:43] why was because uh really it wasn't
[07:46] because of wealth inequality it was
[07:47] because wealth inequality as a result of
[07:50] that cannibalistic Force right um you
[07:53] know there's all kinds of monetary
[07:54] problems everything of course but after
[07:57] um after you know the Great
[08:00] 1929 what the American government did
[08:02] and a lot of their wisdom quote unquote
[08:05] was said we need to raise prices right
[08:07] prices are falling this is deflation
[08:09] deflation is bad blah blah blah we need
[08:11] to force prices up right wait we need to
[08:13] force the price of food housing
[08:14] everything up right because so much
[08:16] money just disappeared from the banking
[08:18] system right if you ask any person
[08:20] that's older that remembers the Great
[08:22] Depression or they're they remember as a
[08:25] child hearing stories of the Great
[08:26] Depression you'll hear the same story
[08:27] over and over again and that was that
[08:29] one day just none of the banks had money
[08:30] right and that's because just all the
[08:32] credit wiped up went from many many many
[08:34] banks just a centralized number of banks
[08:36] right again centralization but what we
[08:38] did was we we
[08:40] artificially um
[08:43] accelerated farming production and
[08:45] destruction M farming much less
[08:46] efficient um and we just slaughtered a
[08:49] bunch of livestock like we just went out
[08:51] and said okay we need to force prices up
[08:53] to save the economy and so let's go out
[08:55] kill a bunch of cows kill a bunch of
[08:57] pigs kill a bunch of animals and that
[08:58] will force food F prices like yeah
[09:00] that's a great idea yeah and let's make
[09:01] farming a little bit more efficient
[09:02] let's let's you know bankrupt a lot of
[09:04] farmers uh you know and that way we'll
[09:06] reforce up you know Farmland prices and
[09:09] food PR and of course what did that
[09:10] happen they had knockoff effects down
[09:12] the line and then you know pretty soon
[09:14] you know they get what they wanted food
[09:16] prices went up housing you know prices
[09:18] start people just couldn't afford it
[09:20] anymore right you know even if they
[09:21] didn't go up in nominal terms they went
[09:23] up in real terms compared to the wages
[09:25] people had and so anyway I suppose
[09:27] that's my point with wealth inequality
[09:29] is that when wealth inequality is the
[09:30] result of somebody leveraging current
[09:34] Global energy for themselves the expense
[09:36] of someone else that's inherently Zero
[09:39] Sum that's inherently taking money from
[09:41] somebody else but if we compare this to
[09:44] the other example which is people
[09:46] actually producing stuff that I don't
[09:48] think is a zome game right like you know
[09:50] let's take this show Robin right youve
[09:52] put in a lot of work you've done many
[09:54] many shows you've been doing a Daily
[09:55] Show it's very impressive in Bitcoin
[09:58] there's very few people in Bitcoin
[09:59] they're doing one more than one show a
[10:01] week I I'm doing more than one show a
[10:03] week I I'm running three soon to be four
[10:05] different Bitcoin podcasts um but you
[10:08] know like you've got this one show and
[10:10] in this one show you are doing a Daily
[10:12] Show and it's very impressive they're
[10:14] well edited right you are putting in a
[10:16] lot of value into the marketplace people
[10:18] are watching it they're clearly
[10:19] subscribing which everyone should do you
[10:21] should like comment subscribe to Robin's
[10:22] channel here um but you are providing
[10:24] value in the marketplace and as a result
[10:27] you are going to get a disproportionate
[10:29] amount of return compared to the rest of
[10:33] of the world rest of Bitcoin right you
[10:35] deserve more views on your Bitcoin
[10:38] podcast than
[10:41] 99.999% of the world's Bitcoin podcast
[10:43] because they don't have Bitcoin podcast
[10:45] right you deserve the any money the show
[10:48] makes you if if it makes you money you
[10:49] deserve any money from it um you know
[10:51] and you deserve the recognition from it
[10:53] right you know um musicians don't
[10:58] produce music at the same quantity or
[11:01] the same quality as each other uh
[11:03] Bitcoin podcasters don't produce the
[11:04] same quality or or quantity as each
[11:07] other um not all CEOs that are stacking
[11:10] Bitcoin buy Bitcoin at the same rate
[11:12] right like Michael saor and so the ones
[11:15] that produce more for the free market
[11:17] deserve more of the returns of their
[11:19] labors right but that you know Works
[11:22] voluntarily you are contributing your
[11:23] work voluntarily people consume it
[11:25] voluntarily and so I don't think that
[11:28] inequality whether it's wealth
[11:29] inequality whether it's Talent
[11:31] inequality whether it's experience
[11:32] inequality uh whether it's reputation
[11:34] inequality you know however you want to
[11:36] Define it for some reason people just
[11:37] arbitrarily say oh wealth inequality is
[11:39] bad right oh we understand some people
[11:41] have better athletic ability than others
[11:43] some people have better you know
[11:44] education there you know all these other
[11:46] things are fine but wealth is bad wealth
[11:48] INE equality is bad and um you know
[11:50] anyway I think a lot of that is just a
[11:51] misidentifying of of nonzero some game
[11:56] wealth inequality with cannibalistic
[11:58] zero some game wealth inequality I think
[12:00] the people that don't understand how
[12:02] money corrupts society and Society then
[12:05] feeds back and corrupts the money I
[12:06] think people don't understand that then
[12:08] collude the two and they say oh the free
[12:09] market Is wealth inequality and that is
[12:12] bad cannibalistic when the reality is
[12:13] that in an actual free market where
[12:15] wealth inequality can flourish um
[12:18] naturally or as a symptom and a result
[12:21] of the free market U grows um you know I
[12:24] I think that's what we'll see and so
[12:26] with Bitcoin I think we're actually
[12:28] going to see wealth in equality increase
[12:29] not decrease because in every poor
[12:32] country there's a lot less wealth
[12:34] inequality in every rich country there's
[12:36] a lot more wealth inequality but the
[12:38] average poor person in a rich country is
[12:40] way richer than the average poor person
[12:42] in other country right so I'm in at the
[12:43] United States right in the United States
[12:45] wealth inequality is a very talked about
[12:47] problem you know the top 1% of of wealth
[12:50] or the top 1% of rich people um in this
[12:55] uh the top 1% of people in this country
[12:57] you know own whatever 45
[12:59] 50% of the wealth you know whatever it
[13:01] is right pick a number right um it's
[13:04] very concentrated at the top I think a
[13:06] big part of that is obviously from Fiat
[13:08] shenans like don't get me wrong you know
[13:10] and you can clearly see the tie with
[13:12] that compared to 1944 1971 wealth in
[13:15] equality Skyrock it's after 1971 but you
[13:18] know I think the other side of that
[13:20] question though is what is the average
[13:21] poor person in America right I forget
[13:23] the poverty line cut off here at America
[13:25] but it's something like6 $18,000 a year
[13:28] something like that I think uh maybe
[13:30] it's 12 but even if it is 12,000 you
[13:33] know that is way more money than what
[13:35] the average person in Kenya makes in the
[13:38] year that's way more money what the
[13:40] average person in uh you know in a lot
[13:43] of Latin America makes surely right like
[13:45] the average quote unquote poor person
[13:47] here in America is poor on a relative
[13:50] basis in America on a ranking scale but
[13:52] they're probably still within the top
[13:55] 15% maybe 20% of global income earners
[13:58] right and so you know I think if we want
[14:01] to think of Bitcoin as a political
[14:03] movement because I think of Bitcoin is a
[14:04] political movement it's a political
[14:06] money it's not a political currency but
[14:09] having people voluntarily join a network
[14:12] that abides by rules and the rules don't
[14:14] have politicians like it's still kind of
[14:16] political right I think we could think
[14:17] of Bitcoin like a this first
[14:18] decentralized nation and if Bitcoin is
[14:21] that if Bitcoin is the metaphorical
[14:23] America and right now we were a
[14:25] metaphorical developing country you know
[14:28] I think I don't think it makes any sense
[14:32] uh you know I've heard some bitcoiners
[14:33] say this and I respect them but I I I
[14:35] just don't think it makes a lot of sense
[14:36] to say oh wealth inequality is going to
[14:39] go down on a Bitcoin St or no I think
[14:41] it's going to go up because everybody is
[14:43] going to have the opportunity to
[14:44] contribute in a free market right most
[14:46] people don't have the opportunity to
[14:47] contribute to free market right now just
[14:48] most people don't and so what happens
[14:51] when more people enter the free market
[14:53] and we don't have a monopoly on monetary
[14:55] policy I think as a function of free
[14:57] market going up we're going to have
[14:59] inevitably more and more people having
[15:03] natural wealth inequality right but the
[15:05] thing is that if you are thinking from
[15:06] the ranking perspective you think oh
[15:08] that's pessimistic you know all the OG
[15:11] Rich bitcoiners are just going to watch
[15:13] it go to the moon and all everyone else
[15:14] is going to be poor and servants or
[15:16] whatever but I I think you know the
[15:18] correct way to look at it the non-zero
[15:20] sum way to look at it is to say you know
[15:23] the average poor person in 2060
[15:25] hopefully is going to be way richer than
[15:27] the average poor person in 25 right um
[15:30] you know and I think and hope that's
[15:32] what we're going to see um but I think
[15:34] we're just going to see more and more of
[15:36] that so I know I've been talking while
[15:38] but I guess to wrap that up like what
[15:40] does it actually mean in numbers I think
[15:42] what that means in numbers that people
[15:44] need to wrap their head around is just
[15:46] orders of magnitude right um going from
[15:48] 10,000 Bitcoin all the way down to
[15:50] 10,000 SATs right from 10,000 SATs you
[15:53] have 100,00 sets a million sets 10
[15:55] million sets 100 million sets uh a
[15:57] billion sets 10 billion 100 billion
[15:59] you know you just go all the way up to
[16:00] 10,000 Bitcoin which is trillion SATs I
[16:04] believe so if you're a SAT trillionaire
[16:05] you got 10,000 Bitcoin if you're a SAT
[16:07] billionaire you've got 10 Bitcoin if
[16:09] you're a SAT millionaire if you got one
[16:10] million SATs right or 1% of a Bitcoin
[16:14] and the funny thing is most people will
[16:16] never have a million sets right A lot of
[16:18] people watching this show probably heard
[16:20] that maybe they believe it maybe they
[16:22] don't but if you believe any significant
[16:25] percentage of the world's adults are
[16:27] going to use Bitcoin it's just inherit
[16:30] most of them will never have a million
[16:31] SATs and so if you are a SAT billionaire
[16:36] 10 Bitcoin right some people watching
[16:38] this maybe only have three Bitcoin so
[16:39] they're 30% of the way to being a SAT
[16:41] billionaire um other people watching
[16:43] this maybe have 30 coins and so they're
[16:46] you know 300% or whatever you they're
[16:48] way over being a SAT billionaire but you
[16:50] know I I think how close they are to 10
[16:52] Bitcoin is irrelevant I think the point
[16:54] stands that there's way more people
[16:57] going to be at the sat millionaire level
[16:59] or below than people above you right and
[17:02] so a lot of people think they're too
[17:03] late to bitcoin and oh all the OG's that
[17:06] bought in 2010 11 12 13 14 15 they all
[17:10] got so lucky I'm too late I only have
[17:13] three Bitcoin I only have 21 Bitcoin I
[17:16] only have you know two-thirds of a
[17:18] Bitcoin you know whatever you know again
[17:20] it's all in here it's all in their mind
[17:23] right it's like it's all ranking right
[17:25] they they perceive themselves to not be
[17:27] early to bitcoin because they are
[17:30] viewing their relative quote unquote
[17:33] status within Bitcoin as a function of
[17:34] how many Bitcoin they have and because
[17:36] everyone else in Bitcoin right now has
[17:39] more coins in them they think to too
[17:40] late but what they're forgetting to keep
[17:42] in mind is that they're not thinking in
[17:43] absolute terms and if everybody's going
[17:45] to have Bitcoin look at the people
[17:47] before you look at the people after you
[17:49] it's not even a question there's 300 to
[17:52] 500 times more people after you than
[17:54] before you and all of a sudden you
[17:55] realize you're not too late you're
[17:56] actually very early and you are you have
[17:59] way more in common with Michael sailor
[18:01] than you have in common with the average
[18:02] person because there's going to be way
[18:04] fewer people between you and Michael
[18:06] sailor you the SAT billionaire and him
[18:08] the SAT trillionaire then you the SAT
[18:11] billionaire and the average person that
[18:14] will not even be a SAT Millionaire right
[18:17] and you know anyway I guess all it to
[18:19] say is that you know I think wealth
[18:21] inequality is um greatly misunderstood I
[18:25] think there's good I think there's
[18:26] wealth inequality is a symptom of of a
[18:29] good free market I think there's wealth
[18:31] inequality as a symptom of evil
[18:33] cannibalistic Society I think uh wealth
[18:35] INE equality is not going to go down on
[18:37] the Bitcoin standard I think it's only
[18:38] going to go up um you know I I I I think
[18:42] it's only go up and hopefully um it's
[18:44] it's going up as a result of the free
[18:46] market and of more and more people
[18:47] having um wealth right I actually think
[18:50] that you know if we could time travel
[18:53] and just see in the future that there
[18:54] was less wealth INE equality in the
[18:56] future um you know I think
[18:59] if there was less wealth inequality in
[19:01] the future I think that's um going to be
[19:03] a bad thing um whereas if there was a
[19:06] lot of wealth INE equality it could be a
[19:07] bad thing because maybe it's because the
[19:09] world's completely centralized on a Fiat
[19:11] standard but I think more likely is that
[19:13] Bitcoin is just taken over everything
[19:15] and the free market has been spread to
[19:16] everybody instead of just you know the
[19:19] 15 20% of Rich Americans um you know and
[19:23] that's the funny thing about us
[19:24] Americans we're typically the most
[19:25] allowed about wealth inequality why
[19:27] because we're basically the richest
[19:29] nation and you know as a nation gets
[19:31] richer they care more and more about
[19:33] that so you know it's it's a bit of our
[19:35] own privilege I think that people making
[19:36] 30 grand a year which are in the top 5%
[19:39] of income earners are complaining about
[19:41] the top 1% it's like you know you're
[19:44] you're complaining about the 4% of
[19:45] people ahead of you while forgetting
[19:47] that to the other 95% of the world you
[19:49] know you're the rich person of them
[19:51] right so
[19:53] anyway that was uh amazing and there a
[19:57] lot a lot to unpack in there um the one
[20:00] thing that I thought about is um when we
[20:03] have this ranking system I love the way
[20:06] how you look at it uh and we uh the one
[20:09] thing to look at the ranking system and
[20:10] the one thing to look at like oh how
[20:12] good I'm actually uh on a personal level
[20:15] like just like blending out all the
[20:17] other people and like just focusing on
[20:20] myself like okay like I can eat every
[20:22] day I have a shelter uh I can I drive
[20:25] around with a car every day I can go
[20:27] across borders like I'm basically pretty
[20:29] rich uh and not comparing yourself to a
[20:32] Michael S who has a yacht and a private
[20:34] jet and all those things like that that
[20:36] seems ridiculous and also one one thing
[20:38] I thought about is um a really quick uh
[20:42] personal story H I'm a professional
[20:44] swimmer not any longer but I was and I
[20:47] was in a small small town and the pool
[20:50] there went completely broke so we had to
[20:52] go to the big city and uh and then I was
[20:56] in a way bigger club and my times in the
[21:00] pool like the how fast I was swimming
[21:02] skyrocketed within one year because in
[21:05] the small town I was the big fish I was
[21:08] the I'm two meters long I like just
[21:11] because of my body I was pretty fast but
[21:13] there were people that were like half my
[21:16] size and were faster than me because
[21:17] they trained harder they were already
[21:19] better uh and just me putting myself in
[21:23] a pawn H literally in a pool where there
[21:26] are so many faster fish to me this
[21:29] motivated me and kept made my own
[21:33] standard so much higher and there's
[21:35] something really good about this
[21:37] competitiveness and what you're also
[21:39] talking about this ranking system where
[21:42] you look um at your surroundings and you
[21:44] maybe uh try to to score higher than
[21:48] than other people so like that's the
[21:49] free market working and that I think
[21:51] that's a good thing as as you also said
[21:53] it the one thing that is probably
[21:56] because people think that equality is
[21:59] bad is because uh of the unfair nature
[22:02] as you said like it's comes from a bad
[22:04] intent it comes from a bad place where
[22:07] why we have this uh inequality and maybe
[22:10] that's connected to like because the the
[22:14] where the poorest line is and how many
[22:16] are under this this poorest line and I
[22:19] guess my my question is a little bit is
[22:20] like will that that poverty line uh if
[22:24] there is something like that um the
[22:26] poverty line comes so wide down that
[22:28] actually like even the last person in
[22:31] that ranking system is pretty good like
[22:33] he can live a pretty good life and a
[22:35] pretty normal life at some point because
[22:38] Bitcoin kind of there this um book I I I
[22:42] was making a podcast with ion abber and
[22:46] he talks about abundance through
[22:48] scarcity it's like could we get to a
[22:51] point where we have so much wealth in
[22:55] overall in the world but the last person
[22:57] in this rank is is is pretty rich to
[23:00] compared to right now uh but there are
[23:03] still a lot of inequality above that
[23:05] which would not be bad it's just a
[23:07] competitive free market which I like a
[23:09] lot yeah I don't know I I don't know if
[23:12] that will happen and I don't know if
[23:13] that's necessarily good thing um I I
[23:16] agree with your point um you know that
[23:18] it's all about comparison right I mean
[23:21] like you myself and probably at least
[23:24] 80% of the people watching the show if
[23:26] not all of them you know can
[23:28] literally today if they really wanted to
[23:31] go to an airport and fly to any country
[23:34] in the world that is safe right it's
[23:36] like for 500 bucks or a thousand bucks
[23:39] which probably most people watching this
[23:40] have in their bank account or in their
[23:42] Bitcoin wallet or whatever um you know
[23:44] they could like that's that's just so
[23:48] Indescribable it's like no no king or
[23:51] emperor of of the world up until you
[23:54] know a century ago could do that uh you
[23:57] know no like we just take for granted
[24:00] that the optionality we don't
[24:02] necessarily execute on but that's still
[24:04] there is just what the richest people in
[24:06] the world 100 years ago couldn't have
[24:08] done right and you know when I talk
[24:09] about you know I've said this before in
[24:11] a couple other videos about how we've
[24:13] the average Bitcoin or today is more in
[24:14] common with Michael sailor than the
[24:16] average Bitcoin holder of 20 30 40 years
[24:19] from now but I think that's true right
[24:21] because Michael sailor like you
[24:22] mentioned he C he has his Yachts he has
[24:24] his Planes you know he's got a jet or
[24:26] multiple Jets I'm sure I mean like he
[24:28] has all of that and can go anywhere in
[24:31] the world whenever he wants um you know
[24:33] and like okay maybe I can't do that
[24:36] maybe you can't do that maybe most
[24:37] people watching this can't do that but
[24:39] we can do 80% of that right like maybe
[24:42] we can't go to Every nice restaurant in
[24:44] the world or every big fancy city in the
[24:46] world whenever we want but we could
[24:48] probably go to at least half of them or
[24:49] at least 80% of them right but for most
[24:52] of the world they can't do any right
[24:55] like I forget what the actual number is
[24:57] um I I encourage people to look up but I
[24:59] think the actual number of people um
[25:02] here let me just look it up real quick
[25:03] uh what percent of the world forget what
[25:06] the actual percentage of people in the
[25:08] world that have flown on a plane is but
[25:10] it's a very very low number um yeah yeah
[25:13] according to Boeing um Boeing's research
[25:17] um 80% of the world has never taken a
[25:19] flight at least I'm actually surprised
[25:21] it's that low I thought it was going to
[25:23] be higher but you know it's like the
[25:25] majority of the world the majority has
[25:28] never flown on a plane once and I've
[25:31] been very fortunate I've got these
[25:33] Bitcoin CES you know I've gone to 13 14
[25:35] Bitcoin CES this year I mean every
[25:37] single one of them has like three plane
[25:39] trips with you know two layovers to get
[25:41] to anyone city right it's like We
[25:43] complain about layovers and oh dang it
[25:46] my you know my flight was cancelled I
[25:48] got to take an extra flight now to this
[25:50] other city it's like you know we
[25:51] complain about an extra flight um on one
[25:55] trip that maybe has you know four to six
[25:57] plane flights
[25:59] and most people never take a one right
[26:01] and so so anyway I guess that's my point
[26:03] that you know again on a relative basis
[26:06] we can feel like we're nowhere close to
[26:09] a certain goal a certain stacking Target
[26:11] or a certain person with a lot more
[26:12] money than us but on an absolute terms
[26:14] it's like it's just not even comparable
[26:16] and so anyway anyway I guess to get back
[26:19] to your question um yeah I don't know I
[26:21] I I do think the average poor person
[26:23] today is doing a lot better than they
[26:25] were you know a couple hundred years ago
[26:27] or even 100 years ago you know this is
[26:29] this is my first Bitcoin thread uh on on
[26:32] Twitter it was about how we've Less in
[26:34] common with their near future in the
[26:35] ancient past and one of the first charts
[26:37] in that thread maybe even the first one
[26:39] in that thread was about human poverty
[26:43] um it's it's from uh our world and data
[26:46] it's a great chart I don't know if you
[26:47] want me to pull it up or not but I guess
[26:49] I could but I I could describe it you
[26:52] know basically over the last few hundred
[26:54] years you know Global poverty has been
[26:56] pretty flat and then it's just had a
[26:58] deep curve down right um and this is
[27:01] part of the point of that thread this is
[27:03] part of the point I keep trying to
[27:04] hammer home for bitcoiners into their
[27:06] brains because I think this is really
[27:08] important for everyone to internalize
[27:10] not because I said it but because it is
[27:12] true and we need to remember this we
[27:14] have less in common with the near future
[27:16] than the ancient past like Rome in
[27:18] ancient Rome you know 2,000 years ago
[27:21] 99% of the world was poor right what we
[27:24] would call Poor right um you know 500
[27:27] years ago 90 6% of the world was poor
[27:30] 200 years ago you know 92% of the world
[27:32] was poor or whatever you know and then
[27:34] 100 years ago like 85% of the world was
[27:36] poor and now it's like 15% of the world
[27:40] is extremely poor making less than $2 a
[27:43] day and you know 70% of the world is
[27:45] making less than $30 a day or it's
[27:48] roughly that I don't know somebody in
[27:49] the comments will roast me for not
[27:51] having it memorized but but I think it's
[27:52] roughly that roughly a little over
[27:54] two-thirds of the world makes less than
[27:55] 30 bucks a day and something like a
[27:57] fifth or six the world makes less than a
[27:59] dollar day it's something like that
[28:00] right now and so at any point on that
[28:03] timeline we've had less in come with the
[28:05] near future in the past right if we go
[28:06] back to Rome if we we're having this
[28:08] conversation in Rome which by the way
[28:09] we're having in person um you know
[28:12] talking over our flock of goats or
[28:14] whatever instead of podcast with mics
[28:16] and you know internet stuff um but we
[28:19] would have less in C with the future in
[28:20] the past right it's like oh wow Rome is
[28:23] really exciting can you believe it like
[28:24] right now 1% of the world is wealthy we
[28:26] have less in common the future in the
[28:27] past in the next 100 years The Next
[28:30] Century the next couple Generations
[28:32] we're going to go from 1% to 2% of the
[28:35] world not being poor that's doubling we
[28:38] are going to have more change in the
[28:39] next 100 years from 0 ad to 100 AD than
[28:44] all of human history thus far wealthwise
[28:46] right we have less in common with that
[28:48] future than the past right then we skip
[28:50] forward you know few hundred years now
[28:52] we're in the Middle Ages or Renaissance
[28:54] or whatever again we have less to come
[28:55] with the future in the past right oh 4%
[28:57] of the world is wealthy now and and you
[29:00] know 96% of the world is still you know
[29:03] very poor you know it doesn't you know
[29:05] like dying of disease or child birth all
[29:07] those things are still very likely you
[29:09] know like no M no matter what point
[29:10] you're at like the near Future's always
[29:12] been more dramatic right going back 100
[29:14] years to early 20th century you know for
[29:17] the entirety of human history over 90%
[29:19] of the world has been poor know 8 to 10%
[29:23] of the world's now wealthy like a 100
[29:24] years from now the year
[29:26] 2025 all of a sudden we're going to go
[29:28] from the majority being poor to the
[29:33] majority not
[29:35] being uh not being on starvation level
[29:38] poor but to lower lower middle class
[29:40] poor like that's where we are right now
[29:42] and so to your question and to the point
[29:45] Y makes you know like yeah I think it's
[29:47] hopeful and possible that in 20 years 30
[29:51] years 50 years we can look back and say
[29:54] yep that's exactly what happened you
[29:56] know 30 years ago in in 2025 the
[30:00] majority of the world was making less
[30:02] than $30 a day the majority of the world
[30:04] and now the majority of the world is
[30:06] making more than the equivalent amount
[30:09] of $30 a day right we have gone from the
[30:12] majority of the world having to wor
[30:13] about child birth uh you know killing
[30:15] the mother killing the child so now the
[30:16] majority of the world doesn't have to
[30:17] worry about that we've gone from the
[30:18] majority of the world worrying about
[30:19] diseases to them not having to worry
[30:21] about them right to the same extent and
[30:24] so I think that we're going to have a
[30:27] greater share
[30:28] uh horizontally of more people being
[30:30] wealthy and a greater amount of wealth
[30:32] vertically of wealth going up right
[30:36] because the richest person 2,000 years
[30:38] ago was poor compared to the richest
[30:40] person a thousand years ago which was
[30:41] poor compared to the richest person a
[30:42] 100 years ago and that person is poor
[30:44] compared to the richest person today and
[30:46] all of the wealth of the richest people
[30:48] in the world the richest dudes right
[30:50] Elon Musk Jeff Bezos Bill Gates Michael
[30:52] sailor right all those guys their
[30:55] maximum wealth today is going to be
[30:56] cheap and terms of wealth in the future
[30:59] right you know let's take Eli musk as a
[31:01] Infamous example right you know Eli musk
[31:04] is the richest person in the world the
[31:05] richest guy in the world I guess you
[31:06] know if you want to only stick with the
[31:09] you know people we know that have a lot
[31:10] of money um and you know he's spending
[31:13] like his whole life and like all of his
[31:14] many to get one person to Mars right
[31:18] like that's his whole goal right whether
[31:19] you agree with it or not like that's
[31:20] what he's doing he's trying to get a
[31:22] dude to Mars right but in 30 years 50
[31:25] years assuming he's successful like
[31:27] people people going to be able to go to
[31:28] Mars for you know like one year salary
[31:31] right like the richest person like the
[31:33] richest guy in the world 50 years from
[31:35] now is going to be able to do way more
[31:36] than what Ela musk can do today right
[31:38] and so not only do we hope a greater
[31:42] share of the world population is wealthy
[31:44] but our whole definition of wealth
[31:45] changes vertically too as we get more
[31:47] wealth so yeah I do think it's possible
[31:50] that the average poor person in the
[31:53] future is way richer than the average
[31:55] person today but
[31:58] number one I don't know if we'll
[32:00] recognize it because that's already
[32:02] happened right like this isn't a
[32:04] theoretical like I think this has
[32:06] already happened like the average poor
[32:07] person today objectively is wealthier
[32:10] than the average poor person you know
[32:13] centuries ago right because the average
[32:15] poor person today doesn't have to worry
[32:16] about kala to the same degree right they
[32:19] don't have to worry about you know so
[32:21] much of you know the ancient world um
[32:24] and so you know I I I I appreciate the
[32:28] question like will average poor person
[32:29] in the future be you know wealthy I
[32:33] think so but will they be content I
[32:34] don't know because they will always be
[32:37] at the bottom of the ladder you know and
[32:40] you know I'm not saying that in a you
[32:42] know mocking or demeaning way it's just
[32:44] like that's the reality like the average
[32:46] poor person in the future maybe they
[32:48] have more wealth than me right like I
[32:49] mean at this time in history we only
[32:52] have you know these little smartphones
[32:54] like these are going away right like
[32:55] these are going to be gone in 20 30 40
[32:57] years I don't know what replaces them
[32:59] it's a little concerning to think about
[33:00] what replaces them but it's like the
[33:02] average poor person the future even if
[33:03] they're richer than me and you and
[33:06] everyone
[33:07] watching like they still may not be
[33:09] happy or content
[33:11] because in the way again humans perceive
[33:14] success being relative they may not be
[33:17] happy and that's not just true of people
[33:19] at the bottom ladder it's true of people
[33:21] near the top of the letter right I mean
[33:23] you
[33:24] know is it better are Americans NE cly
[33:28] happier in the rest of the world I don't
[33:29] I don't know cuz people in poverty in
[33:33] other parts of the world they work all
[33:34] day you know they have Community they
[33:36] need Community to survive and and you
[33:38] know get by and have a dream of a future
[33:41] right maybe they you know buy a train
[33:42] ticket to a different country maybe they
[33:44] save up for family business or whatever
[33:46] but here in America we're wealthy we
[33:47] don't need that we don't need to Aspire
[33:49] to you know make it to the other side
[33:51] where the grass is greener uh you know
[33:53] we're wealthy and we have the fortune to
[33:56] be able to sit at home
[33:58] and scroll on these little things all
[33:59] day and see videos of people that have
[34:02] the Jets and the Lambos and the in the
[34:04] mansions and so you know even though
[34:07] we're a lot richer um a
[34:11] ironic ironic uh result of our own
[34:14] success is that as a result of our own
[34:16] success we have time to enjoy our
[34:18] success and in that time of our success
[34:20] we we see others being more successful
[34:23] and therefore Ian we feel worse so so
[34:26] anyway like I think it's I I think
[34:28] it's yeah I think it's an economics
[34:30] question but I think it's more so a
[34:31] human psychology question I think the
[34:33] average poor person will be richer in
[34:36] productivity but will they be richer in
[34:38] contentment or uh life satisfaction I
[34:41] think that's a different question I
[34:42] don't know if you watch or listen to my
[34:45] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[34:47] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[34:50] the most important step is to keep their
[34:53] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[34:56] wallet my personal recommendation for
[34:57] hard wallet is the bit box it's super
[35:00] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[35:03] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[35:05] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can

[35:18] step is to really level up your
[35:20] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[35:23] have the most secure self custody setup
[35:25] you have to secure your own devices you
[35:28] have to protect your privacy you have to
[35:31] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[35:34] on where you live you even want to have
[35:36] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[35:39] move in case something goes really
[35:41] really wrong and through all those steps

[35:57] sovereignty and last but not least I
[36:00] have something completely new for you
[36:02] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[36:06] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[36:09] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[36:12] look at that beauty I love it so much
[36:14] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[36:18] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[36:20] way to go out there and show that you
[36:23] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[36:26] Bitcoin only only and coin vigilante
[36:29] just dropped a completely new and
[36:31] amazing Genesis edition of their watch
[36:35] collections you have the date of the
[36:37] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[36:40] and of course also the block height and
[36:43] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[36:46] level of detail they put in in this
[36:49] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[36:51] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[36:55] down in the descriptions I love those
[36:57] watch
[36:58] so so much probably even it's really a
[37:02] love the way how you think about it
[37:04] because um like even if we just look at
[37:07] like 100 years ago uh the average person
[37:10] now like the average show on on this
[37:12] world living he can do so much more than
[37:16] the richest dude alive like 100 or 200
[37:18] years ago that's that that's a
[37:20] fascinating mind shift perspective to to
[37:23] do it that's that's really powerful
[37:25] honestly really cool also like like the
[37:28] uh I mean you kind of answer my next
[37:30] question so we will not go into deep to
[37:33] that but I wanted to ask you like if if
[37:35] that envy and that feeling like oh like
[37:38] let's tax the rich like let's do that
[37:40] but you kind of answered it already we
[37:42] like oh no that that will probably not
[37:44] go away maybe even like be more there I
[37:48] don't know um but now to the next one
[37:52] what do you think then actually Bitcoin
[37:55] changes when when there's like like
[37:57] ranking system it makes it more fair
[38:00] because everyone is kind of paying into
[38:02] the same like let's assume that Bitcoin
[38:04] is um a global world uh currency Global
[38:08] World asset and then when you produce
[38:11] something you save it in Bitcoin and
[38:13] therefore you we all benefit from you
[38:16] making the world more productive and and
[38:18] and more Innovative um when we have this
[38:21] world what what what truly changes in
[38:24] that ranking system compared to the the
[38:27] Central banking system that we we have
[38:29] now Central banking system power is who
[38:32] has the most money right really what
[38:35] we're attracted to his power like we're
[38:37] not actually attracted to the money
[38:38] we're attracted to power right female
[38:40] peacocks are attracted to peacocks with
[38:41] a lot of feathers right luses are
[38:43] attracted to the line with Maine um
[38:46] people are attracted to power right um
[38:49] you know stereotyp
[38:52] stereotypical roles here but you know
[38:55] men typically are attracted to women
[38:57] that have the power or the ability let's
[39:00] say to produce children right and so
[39:01] women that are perceived as beautiful
[39:03] are you know the the the desire of men
[39:07] and likewise women are attracted to men
[39:10] that have a certain degree of power
[39:12] right whether that's physically being
[39:14] big muscles which I certainly don't have
[39:16] um or money status whatever and I I I I
[39:20] say that to say like I think I think
[39:22] that's what we're actually attracted to
[39:24] and so I think what creates power in the
[39:26] two different systems is the way to look
[39:28] at that right so in Central Banking and
[39:30] Fiat what brings more power what brings
[39:33] more influence it is reputation it is U
[39:37] accolades and and you know status and it
[39:41] is money right the more money you have
[39:43] the longer reputation you have with with
[39:45] everyone else close to the money printer
[39:47] the more power you have and so therefore
[39:49] the whole thing comes down to ranking
[39:51] who has the most money right who has the
[39:53] biggest um you know who who has the
[39:56] biggest number numbers behind their name
[39:58] like that is the thing that attract more
[40:00] money right money brings more money
[40:02] because we're in a political currency
[40:04] Ponzi scheme and so that's what we all
[40:07] from the top down all implicitly desire
[40:10] right we all want a bigger house with
[40:11] more dollars even if it doesn't change
[40:13] your lifestyle at all right like your
[40:15] house let's say if it's you know half a
[40:16] million dollars it could go up and down
[40:18] a percent in value in any given month
[40:20] make five or you can make
[40:23] or you can make or lose more money in
[40:25] any given mouth any given month on the
[40:27] the value of your house than your income
[40:29] right like let's say your income is five
[40:31] grand a month your house is half a
[40:33] million your house goes up in value 1%
[40:37] because rates got cut or something
[40:39] you've made more money in your house
[40:40] this month than your income right or or
[40:41] vice versa you know and it's but it
[40:44] doesn't impact your life at all it's the
[40:46] exact same house you're living in at the
[40:48] first of the month it's the same house
[40:49] you're living in at the 31 of the month
[40:50] so um you know but still nonetheless We
[40:54] crave that number right so
[40:59] um I was having this conversation with
[41:01] with um someone recently about how you
[41:04] know they they stacked an extra little
[41:05] bit of Bitcoin and you know it they were
[41:09] happy because they increased their sat
[41:11] stack but at the same time it's like
[41:14] doesn't change my life at all I'm never
[41:15] going to sell it you know he's doing it
[41:18] I guess for greater peace of mind but
[41:20] why do people eventually stop stacking
[41:21] Bitcoin because Bitcoin number has gone
[41:24] up price has gone up and they were
[41:26] wealthy they stacking because they've
[41:28] already achieved the peace of mind right
[41:29] like when you are early to bitcoin and
[41:32] you don't yet feel like you have quote
[41:34] unquote enough Bitcoin um it's because
[41:37] you don't feel like you have enough
[41:38] Bitcoin to be or or have the stability
[41:42] yet um you know but once that's achieved
[41:45] I see it all the time with my clients at
[41:47] at Bitcoin adviser I see it all the time
[41:48] with people I help uh you know because
[41:50] my job at Bitcoin advisers to help
[41:52] people stack more Bitcoin right my
[41:53] average client I help them stack an
[41:55] extra 51.2% more Bitcoin in the first 12
[41:57] months and so obviously that that's an
[42:00] average so some people stack only 10%
[42:02] more Bitcoin other people stack 300%
[42:04] more Bitcoin and the funny thing is that
[42:07] you know as I work with clients you know
[42:09] some of them I build you know pretty
[42:11] good relationship with and I see that
[42:13] mindset just totally shift like I walk
[42:15] them we walk through it and over the
[42:17] course of a year over the course of six
[42:20] months like their mindset just totally
[42:21] shifts and they go from oh my goodness I
[42:23] don't have nearly enough I need to
[42:25] accelerate my stacking to now okay their
[42:27] sat stack has doubled um you know their
[42:29] sat stack has doubled they limited their
[42:31] expenses and
[42:32] like you know and more importantly as
[42:35] importantly they've secured their
[42:36] Bitcoin and proper self- custody and
[42:39] they look around and they're like I've
[42:40] achieved that Comfort I don't need to
[42:42] have that same urgency anymore that that
[42:45] that the the asymmetric bet is no longer
[42:47] in my favor right you know doing all
[42:48] these sacrifices to stack is no longer
[42:51] required because I have enough I'm still
[42:53] going to stack I'm still going to stack
[42:55] a lot but it it's a whole mental shift
[42:59] so anyway um yeah so yeah I think
[43:03] there's a lot there and I I think um you
[43:06] know I I think it just comes down to
[43:09] that perception people have
[43:11] um
[43:13] yeah interesting how do you um I mean I
[43:18] guess it's a highly individual question
[43:21] to to each individual but how do you uh
[43:24] get someone to to to
[43:27] stack more without having like more
[43:30] income and stuff like that what what are
[43:31] some of the things that that you can
[43:33] share about what what mind shift shift
[43:36] you make with your uh clients well I I
[43:38] think it comes back to Power right so
[43:40] like I was saying before humans are
[43:42] attracted to power on a on Essential
[43:44] Baking standard the metric at which we
[43:47] value power is more money right and I
[43:50] guess the implication I made although I
[43:52] probably should have said it more
[43:52] explicitly the the power in Bitcoin is
[43:55] the idea right like why do we respect
[43:57] Michael sailor is it because he has
[43:59] money
[44:00] no no you know most people think oh you
[44:03] bitcoiners you idolize or you love
[44:04] Michael sailor because he's so freaking
[44:06] rich it's like no actually it's not why
[44:08] it's because he's got the ideas like
[44:10] Michael sailor you know and he's already
[44:13] come up like five times already brought
[44:15] him up like five times but I think it's
[44:17] very useful because he's a good
[44:18] oversimplification for this whole
[44:20] dynamic you know why does Michael sailor
[44:22] have a unique position of power in
[44:25] bitcoin's history it's
[44:27] because he has the money and as
[44:31] importantly I would argue more
[44:33] importantly he has the ideas right and
[44:35] so Michael sailor has an advantage in
[44:38] the Fiat Central Banking era because he
[44:40] has way more access to money than you
[44:42] and I do and cheap money and in the
[44:44] Bitcoin era he's still going to be one
[44:46] of the richest people in the world in
[44:48] all Bitcoin because unlike all the other
[44:50] billionaires that yet to come after him
[44:51] they don't have the ideas right you know
[44:53] billionaires coming after him maybe they
[44:55] buy as much Bitcoin as he does maybe
[44:56] they buy more even a couple of them
[44:58] probably will but they were not here
[45:00] with the plebs in 2020 in 2021 and 2022
[45:03] and 2023 and 2024 in 2025 right they
[45:06] weren't here with the plebs they weren't
[45:07] sharing ideas right and so I I I I yeah
[45:11] so anyway to summarize explicitly uh to
[45:14] your earlier question the power in the
[45:16] Fiat Central Banking era is with money
[45:19] how many political currency units do you
[45:20] own how much private Equity do you
[45:22] control how much um you know what's your
[45:25] multiple right it's all numbers numbers
[45:26] numbers right who gets the most
[45:27] political currency no matter the means
[45:29] that is the person with the most power
[45:31] in a system that requires increas in
[45:35] centralization but in Bitcoin the the
[45:39] metric I think in that world is going to
[45:41] be ideas because how do you get more
[45:43] power in a Bitcoin world how you get
[45:45] more power is not by who has the most
[45:47] Bitcoin currency units the most
[45:49] electricity currency units the most SS
[45:51] the way you get more Bitcoin in a
[45:52] Bitcoin world is a better idea ideas are
[45:55] secondary in the Fiat world ideas are
[45:57] Central and pivotal in the Bitcoin world
[46:00] and that was a lesson I had to learn U
[46:03] uh over time because I remember when I
[46:05] first uh quote unquote came on of the
[46:07] Bitcoin scene um you know I thought no
[46:10] nobody's going to listen to me who cares
[46:12] nobody cares I'm a young 20-y old guy um
[46:14] you know I don't have any money I don't
[46:16] have a big company I've exited I don't
[46:18] like I don't have any metric you know I
[46:21] I never finished College I dropped out
[46:22] of college like who's going to listen to
[46:24] me what do I have to show for and I
[46:26] realized that the thing people care
[46:28] about is ideas and I I mean now in
[46:31] hindsight it kind of seems obvious to me
[46:32] but at the time I didn't I didn't
[46:34] believe it I didn't get it now I see
[46:36] that okay the bitcoiners different the
[46:38] bitcoiners all they care about his ideas
[46:40] right so so anyway I I think that's the
[46:43] future in Bitcoin is that that is how
[46:47] power shifts from right now we idolize
[46:50] people with the most currency units to
[46:51] in the future in the Bitcoin world we
[46:52] idolize people with the best ideas
[46:54] because literally
[46:57] that gets you more Bitcoin if you have
[46:58] the better idea you can make the Better
[46:59] Business you get more Bitcoin if you
[47:01] have the better idea you you can gain
[47:03] more more audience members you can gain
[47:06] more attention you can you know if you
[47:07] have the best idea wins bitcoin's the
[47:10] best idea and so the people on bitcoin
[47:12] with the best ideas win a top the system
[47:14] that rewards the best ideas um and so
[47:18] that I guess you know more explicitly
[47:21] answers that last question but at the
[47:22] same time it's the same answer for this
[47:24] question too how how so the Bitcoin
[47:27] advisor we have 40 people on the team I
[47:29] was the first American at the team uh
[47:30] we've been doing this you know the
[47:32] team's been doing this since 2016 um how
[47:36] how do we help people buy more Bitcoin
[47:37] well it's all frankly ideas right it's
[47:39] like every year we have 40 people on
[47:42] bitcoin advisor team and so every year
[47:43] that passes we have 40 Minds out there
[47:46] that are out there working thinking that
[47:48] are very active in Bitcoin self- custody
[47:50] very active in the Bitcoin Community
[47:52] listening learning um you know basically
[47:55] it's like a hive mind and so when people
[47:56] become a client of the Bitcoin adviser
[47:58] they're basically getting all the access
[48:00] of that right like you know what's going
[48:01] to what's going to be the education for
[48:05] the average person right is it is it one
[48:07] person spending you know two hours a day
[48:09] every day their whole life learning
[48:12] about Bitcoin or is it going to be them
[48:14] paying for a service that gives them
[48:16] access to dozens of people dozens of in
[48:19] my opinion the top people in Bitcoin
[48:21] that are all learning on their behalf
[48:23] and have a direct Financial incentive to
[48:26] help them learn right so Bitcoin advisor
[48:28] we have half a percent service fee yeah
[48:30] I'm just saying this to explain answer
[48:32] your question we have a half percent
[48:33] service fee and why I I what I often
[48:35] joke to people is that if joining the
[48:37] Bitcoin advisor we can help you stack at
[48:39] least half a percent more Bitcoin it
[48:40] pays for yourself right what's cheaper
[48:42] than a product was cheaper than a cheap
[48:44] product the thing is cheaper than a
[48:45] cheap product is a more expensive
[48:47] service that pays for itself and then
[48:49] that's cheaper right um and so we're
[48:51] Tech agnostic at the Bitcoin advisor we
[48:53] don't care what technology you use we
[48:55] don't care what platform you use module
[48:57] the multis product we use how you you
[48:58] know store your you know configuration
[49:00] files or you know Hardware device you
[49:02] know we don't care about any of that the
[49:03] incentive is not by how many hours do we
[49:05] book you for it's not by what products
[49:08] can we shield for you so we get an
[49:09] affiliate link the the the thing that
[49:11] we're incentivized with is how do we
[49:13] help you buy more Bitcoin and so frankly
[49:15] it just comes down to incentive I I have
[49:17] a direct incentive for my clients to
[49:19] help them stack more Bitcoin as fast as
[49:21] possible at the cheapest price possible
[49:23] and so of course with that being an
[49:25] incentive is inevitably going to result
[49:28] and us having the conversation that
[49:30] often times is them just having new
[49:32] ideas they didn't think of otherwise
[49:33] right so you know I have seen people um
[49:38] and this is just in general right both
[49:39] as a result of being a client in mind
[49:40] and just in general right people that
[49:42] have money in their Roth IRA they don't
[49:45] realize they can roll over to bitcoin
[49:47] maybe they got bonds or some mutual fund
[49:48] in there and they just haven't had the
[49:50] idea to roll the money over in there and
[49:53] so them having the knowledge to do that
[49:54] and then being able to see to do that to
[49:56] take self custody within their Roth IRA
[49:58] within their Superfund that is a big
[50:00] value to them for other people in
[50:02] particular Americans they don't realize
[50:04] that there are these things called
[50:06] revocable and irrevocable trusts theyve
[50:08] never thought about that before they're
[50:09] already stacking Bitcoin for their kids
[50:11] and so this is a good tool for them to
[50:13] have it's a good idea for them to
[50:14] explore but unfortunately the problem is
[50:16] that they don't realize that the United
[50:18] States of America is cutting off the
[50:20] irrevocable trust significantly at the
[50:22] end of 2024 we've got um less than three
[50:26] months now
[50:27] left until America reduces uh the the
[50:30] cut off or or the you know full benefits
[50:32] of irrevocable trust from 13 million
[50:34] down to 5 million right and most people
[50:37] say oh that doesn't matter because I
[50:39] don't have $5 million $13 million but it
[50:41] doesn't matter because Bitcoin is going
[50:42] to be worth that at some point right and
[50:44] that $7 million difference being able to
[50:46] have an extra $7 million of of of wealth
[50:50] that you're going to be able to legally
[50:51] avoid death taxes legally avoid capital
[50:54] gains it's like that is a huge benefit
[50:56] right and we are incentivized to discuss
[50:58] those ideas with clients because as a
[51:01] function of helping them save you know
[51:04] 30% on their tax bill 20 years from now
[51:06] that is helping them stack more Bitcoin
[51:08] right effectively um you know so whether
[51:11] it's it's finding ways to protect the
[51:12] Bitcoin like minimize taxes minimize the
[51:14] risk of key loss inherit planning all
[51:16] that stuff but really the fun part is
[51:18] helping people buy more Bitcoin so one
[51:20] way of seeing people do it is just
[51:23] getting peace of mind that is the
[51:24] biggest way at which people stack more
[51:27] Bitcoin right you know maybe the husband
[51:29] is wanting to buy more Bitcoin the wife
[51:31] is uncomfortable you know the husband is
[51:34] wanting to refinance the house take out
[51:36] 20% of the equity in the house and smash
[51:37] by Bitcoin because they can get a 6%
[51:39] interest rate or whatever something
[51:40] that's really good right but the wife
[51:42] the family whoever doesn't want to do
[51:43] that well by sitting down with them and
[51:45] talking with the family you know we can
[51:48] uncover things that may not have been
[51:49] realized before right you know the the
[51:51] husband may think oh you know the wife
[51:54] doesn't want me to buy more Bitcoin
[51:55] because she doesn't in Bitcoin she just
[51:57] doesn't understand it I'm going to send
[51:58] another Michael sailor podcast we sit
[52:01] down we talk and we realize oh she's
[52:03] actually not concerned about Bitcoin
[52:05] she's concerned you're going to lose the
[52:06] Bitcoin she's not concerned that bitcoin
[52:09] price is volatile she actually kind of
[52:11] gets it or she wants to understand it
[52:13] more okay and here's some resources we
[52:14] can have to help her what we begin to
[52:16] uncover in that conversation was you
[52:17] realize oh her big concern was that if
[52:19] something happens to you she doesn't
[52:21] know anything with how to handle the
[52:22] Bitcoin well let's set up this security
[52:25] solution let's set up some her plan just
[52:26] walk everyone in the family through how
[52:28] this works let's bring that peace of
[52:30] mind let's bring that comfort and now we
[52:31] have the implicit ability to double our
[52:35] DCA which then doubles the ability to
[52:37] stick or maybe we have the implicit you
[52:39] know or explicit you know authority to
[52:41] sell the extra car we don't need to buy
[52:43] more Bitcoin to refinance some other
[52:45] kind of high interest debt for lower
[52:46] interest rate debt to borrow money to
[52:48] buy Bitcoin right and so people of
[52:50] different ways I've seen people take out
[52:51] multi-million dollar loans at 0%
[52:53] interest for 10 years via some
[52:55] government loan um you know and use a
[52:57] portion of that if not the majority of
[52:59] that to buy Bitcoin I've seen people um
[53:01] decide you know I'm dollar cost
[53:03] averaging $1,000 a month to bitcoin why
[53:06] instead of dollar cost averaging a
[53:07] thousand months to bitcoin over the next
[53:08] 100 months why don't I just borrow a 100
[53:11] Grand lump some today because
[53:12] historically Lum some outperforms DCA
[53:14] and then I used that cash flow I was
[53:16] going to use to buy Bitcoin anyway to
[53:18] then use to pay off the debt right and
[53:19] so of course every option has its own
[53:21] risks you know borrowing not borrowing
[53:24] doing this doing that having it within a
[53:26] tax account having it without taxable
[53:27] account having it within a rable trust
[53:29] outside of a rable trust all these
[53:30] things have tradeoffs and options but
[53:33] like I was saying before power in
[53:35] Bitcoin is interpr than power in the
[53:37] Fiat system power in the Fiat system is
[53:39] who has most political currency power in
[53:41] Bitcoin is who has the most ideas and
[53:43] the most ideas for optionality and so
[53:45] all we do at the Bitcoin adviser is we
[53:47] give people optionality and say hey here
[53:50] are the 30 ideas you have right now of
[53:52] how to stack more Bitcoin here's an
[53:53] additional 20 ideas we'll work on
[53:55] another 10 ideas we'll probably have new
[53:57] ideas every year and here are all the
[54:00] ideas which of these do you want to do
[54:02] and if once you decide which of these
[54:04] you want to do we can help make sure
[54:06] you're going to do it in the safest way
[54:07] possible to minimize your tax bill stack
[54:09] as many Bitcoins you can uh you know and
[54:11] frankly history you know the track
[54:14] record proves itself frankly um you know
[54:17] some some my clients you know we stack a
[54:20] little bit more like an extra 5 10%
[54:22] other people most people would probably
[54:24] stack you know 30 40% just anecdotally
[54:27] that's my experience but the average
[54:29] technically is 51.2% because some people
[54:31] just go out there and really achieve
[54:33] because they had a small business they
[54:34] never thought about having a small
[54:36] business stack Bitcoin uh maybe they
[54:38] have a church and their Pastor or their
[54:39] Elders at the church are trying to
[54:41] understand Bitcoin but haven't got their
[54:42] head around it it's just too much work
[54:43] well hey if we can set up a multisig
[54:45] where you know the Elders of the church
[54:47] can each hold a key well now we can
[54:48] remove that concern of a single point of
[54:50] failure and now the church can start
[54:51] buying or the small business can start
[54:53] buying or you know the other members of
[54:54] the family right and
[54:57] for me that's the most fun part at work
[54:59] is when people join the service because
[55:01] they're trying to help themselves but
[55:03] then they realize after you know some
[55:05] pretty quick realized that oh this is
[55:07] the way to get my uncle to buy more
[55:10] Bitcoin this is the way to get my
[55:11] parents to buy more Bitcoin right it's
[55:12] like yeah I'm buying Bitcoin myself but
[55:15] if I help my parents buy more
[55:16] Bitcoin and I help them do it in a uh a
[55:21] multisig solution that's
[55:22] jurisdictionally Arbitrage that has an
[55:24] inherence plan that bitcoin's eventually
[55:25] get going to get back to me right that's
[55:28] in my own self-interest it's in my
[55:29] interest to help my parents understand
[55:30] Bitcoin and plug him in in this you know
[55:33] multi solution where they cannot lose
[55:35] their Bitcoin and nobody has ever lost
[55:36] their Bitcoin in this solution right
[55:38] that's in my incentive because I want
[55:39] more Bitcoin and the fastest way for me
[55:41] to get more Bitcoin is no longer just to
[55:43] use my own income but to Leverage The
[55:45] incomes of my loved ones around me it's
[55:47] in my own self-interest right but at the
[55:49] same time it's in their self-interest
[55:51] because of course you want to help your
[55:52] dad of course you want to help your kid
[55:54] of course you want to help your church
[55:54] your business you're a boss your
[55:56] employees whomever of course you want to
[55:58] help them buy more Bitcoin because it's
[55:59] in their best interest and so anyway um
[56:02] there's lots of different ways for this
[56:03] to happen you know some people are more
[56:05] complicated than others some people um
[56:08] it's just as simple as them not
[56:09] realizing they can take self- codyy
[56:11] within their super fund within their uh
[56:14] Ira inherited IRA traditional you know
[56:16] Roth whatever like some people just
[56:18] don't realize that um you know I've got
[56:20] some people that U you know just haven't
[56:23] thought about oh wait you know I've got
[56:26] I don't have a Roth IRA my wife doesn't
[56:28] have a Roth IRA I've got three kids you
[56:30] know that are all you know let's say 18
[56:32] to 21 will shoot I could contribute
[56:35] Seven Grand she can contribute Seven
[56:37] Grand each of them we could give them
[56:39] Seven Grand they can each contribute on
[56:40] I mean the bitcoin's going to them
[56:41] anyway when I die right so all of a
[56:43] sudden that's one two three four five
[56:45] five time seven um you know what's five
[56:48] time 7 35 that's 35 Grand of Bitcoin I
[56:50] can buy you know this taxable year and
[56:52] then that's 35 Grand I could buy the
[56:54] first of next year just a smash by all a
[56:56] sudden I've got one whole Bitcoin that's
[56:58] in full self- custody
[57:01] with no upside of with with no with no
[57:05] capital gains for all the upside right I
[57:07] can get one Bitcoin maybe I've got all
[57:09] these other Bitcoin elsewhere so anyway
[57:11] my rambling point is that there's a
[57:13] bunch of different ways to do that and
[57:15] you know there's not a one-size fits-all
[57:16] solution so I don't really feel
[57:18] comfortable saying a one- siiz fits-all
[57:19] solution but probably the best
[57:21] summarization of it is just ideas time
[57:24] and talking to people getting to know
[57:26] people what is your goal is your goal to
[57:28] retire in8 years is your goal to pass it
[57:30] on for your kids is your goal this is
[57:31] your goal that well based on what you
[57:33] want based on what your goal is and
[57:35] based on my personal experience and
[57:37] based on the experience of these other
[57:38] you know 39 people at the Bitcoin
[57:39] adviser and our experience working with
[57:41] many many clients over the years um you
[57:44] know especially you know our partners
[57:45] Peter and Andy um you know basically how
[57:48] can we help you have the ability to
[57:51] stack as much as you can while
[57:53] minimizing downside loss and maximizing
[57:55] um upside as soon as possible right
[57:57] because that's the other thing too is
[57:58] that um if we can if we can accelerate
[58:02] someone's education by three years
[58:04] that's a that's a big deal right because
[58:05] bitcoin price three years from now is
[58:06] probably going to be a lot higher I wish
[58:08] I had that um because I certainly didn't
[58:11] and you know I learn a lot of lessons
[58:13] both to the upside and the downside you
[58:15] know um I I I guess to conclude this
[58:19] little answer here is a metaphor um you
[58:23] know I think the metaphor is like
[58:25] comparing somebody that teaches guns or
[58:27] somebody that teaches cars right most
[58:29] people are out there and they ask me
[58:30] Luke what's the best hball Luke what's
[58:32] the best product what's the best this
[58:33] what's the best that I'm I'm confused
[58:35] I'm I'm scared there's so many options
[58:36] blah blah blah it's like what you don't
[58:38] need you don't need another product
[58:39] right you don't need to you don't need
[58:41] to hear about the new latest car model
[58:43] right there's a thousand car models out
[58:45] there every single one's different every
[58:46] single one has its nuances like and I
[58:48] don't know what the answer is for you
[58:49] because I don't know what your
[58:49] priorities are what you don't you don't
[58:51] need another car model what you need is
[58:53] a driving instructor like the first time
[58:56] you're going to drive a car probably the
[58:57] first 10 times you're going to drive a
[58:58] car you need a driving instructor that's
[58:59] going to come alongside you and teach
[59:01] you about all the different kinds of
[59:03] cars right or likewise with guns you
[59:05] know you want to go to a gun range with
[59:07] you know 30 different guns laid out in
[59:08] front of you and ask somebody hey what's
[59:11] your favorite kind of gun when you know
[59:14] you have all these different people each
[59:16] incentivized for their own product like
[59:17] okay this person gets a 5% Kickback from
[59:19] selling that gun that person gets a 10%
[59:21] affiliate link of selling that gun not
[59:23] there's anything wrong with that right
[59:24] you know I've done that before you know
[59:26] if you believe in the product like it's
[59:28] good to sell the product but probably
[59:29] the most efficient thing to help the
[59:32] person understand Bitcoin more
[59:34] efficiently faster at most importantly a
[59:37] cheaper bitcoin price is to be a trainer
[59:40] alongside them and educate them on all
[59:42] the products and help them do that so
[59:44] anyway that was a very long answer but
[59:46] the long answer short is that in the
[59:48] Fiat world power is who has the most
[59:50] currency and the Bitcoin world power is
[59:52] who has the best ideas and frankly
[59:55] people are willing to pay
[59:56] for the network of people that have
[59:59] really good ideas and so that's what
[60:01] that's what I try to do that's what we
[60:03] try to do is we try to have the best
[60:05] ideas be perpetually 18 to 24 months
[60:07] ahead of everyone
[60:08] else I love that a lot and uh time is
[60:12] really valuable in Bitcoin right the
[60:15] sooner you understand what you're doing
[60:16] uh the sooner the better it's like the
[60:19] first time stepping into Bitcoin uh when
[60:21] you do that that's already valuable if
[60:23] that's like one year or two years ahead
[60:25] of that but then also within Bitcoin um
[60:29] just like having the knowledge of like
[60:31] year three already in year one that's
[60:34] like a major advantage and it's probably
[60:36] uh the best financial decision you can
[60:38] ever take to get that ideas and those
[60:40] knowledges already like in year one and
[60:43] not in year three or year four that's
[60:45] that's really really cool I love that I
[60:47] had so many uh different topics already
[60:50] planned out but we probably make like in
[60:51] half a year or year a second round just
[60:53] for that um because we already one hour
[60:56] and we have end routine um one question
[60:59] that I really would like to to give to
[61:01] you is also um that we give to every
[61:04] guest of our show what can we learn from
[61:06] you besides Bitcoin is that I hope
[61:10] people can learn not just how to get
[61:11] rich in Bitcoin or how early they are in
[61:13] Bitcoin and that is important right I
[61:16] think we're very early to bitcoin I talk
[61:18] about how early we are to bitcoin not as
[61:20] a means
[61:21] of hopium but as a bit of you know a bit
[61:26] of legitimate respectable fear right
[61:29] it's like again do you have less in come
[61:31] with near future than ancient past you
[61:32] have more in come with Michael sailor if
[61:34] you are a SAT billionaire or even in the
[61:36] discussion of being close to a SAT
[61:38] billionaire you have more in common with
[61:39] Michael sailor than the average person
[61:41] in the future right you're going to be a
[61:42] Target you're going to be Target for
[61:44] scammers coming after you for people
[61:45] using AI Bots to come after you and your
[61:47] family for fishing attacks SIM card
[61:48] swaps people trying to get your seed
[61:50] phrase right exploiting everything they
[61:51] can cryptographically they're going to
[61:53] exploit everything they can with the tax
[61:55] man they're going to exploit everything
[61:56] they can with law fair right I think
[61:57] it's a big one I've not mentioned it
[62:00] this show and I've mentioned it a few
[62:01] other times but I think that's a big one
[62:02] people in Bitcoin are forgetting is like
[62:05] all the Fiat parasites where they're
[62:06] going to become unemployed uh you know
[62:10] they're gonna have a new Target and
[62:11] that's going to be OG bitcoiners right
[62:13] they're going to come after everyone in
[62:15] Bitcoin that was before 2030 or 2035 and
[62:17] say this person's got a good amount of
[62:19] Bitcoin let's sue them because they
[62:21] offended me online or whatever right or
[62:23] they gave bad financial device quote
[62:24] unquote online or whatever
[62:26] right and it's like if I can't get them
[62:27] cryptographically maybe I could leverage
[62:29] the courts against them and make their
[62:30] life you know really really
[62:31] uncomfortable you know and so all I to
[62:34] say is that um I hope people learn it's
[62:37] not just about Bitcoin number go up
[62:39] hopium you just want to see Bitcoin go
[62:40] to $50 million but it's that if
[62:43] bitcoin's GNA go $50 million and you've
[62:45] got half of Bitcoin are you ready for
[62:47] $25 million net worth I mean frankly
[62:51] most people are um I I firmly believe at
[62:53] least 90% of people in Bitcoin right now
[62:56] are going to lose at least a third of
[62:58] the Bitcoin because I have seen people
[63:00] lose Bitcoin in so many different ways
[63:03] ways
[63:05] that um are
[63:07] just very difficult to describe um even
[63:11] people that have had experience right um
[63:13] whether that's from the courts or that's
[63:15] from losing keys or that's from you know
[63:16] people stealing it or whatever um any
[63:19] single point of failure is perpetually
[63:22] larger Honeypot as Bitcoin goes up every
[63:24] time bitcoin price doubles
[63:26] the the target of any single point
[63:28] failure you have is triple the Target
[63:31] right um associated with that goes up
[63:33] right every time bitcoin price doubles
[63:34] your stress associated with with it goes
[63:36] up so I I I hope people learn that or
[63:41] hear that from me is that yes I'm
[63:43] bullish in Bitcoin yes we Less comption
[63:45] in the past but that is everything you
[63:47] trade off um yes the benefit is that's
[63:50] going to be rich that's that's going to
[63:51] make you rich that's the benefit the
[63:52] downside is that you're going to be rich
[63:55] and you know Michael sailor has problems
[63:58] that the average poor person can't
[63:59] relate to right and likewise you know
[64:02] you're going to have problems being a
[64:03] SAT billionaire that we can't really
[64:04] relate to right now problems and threats
[64:07] we haven't even begun to think about yet
[64:08] because the technology doesn't yet exist
[64:11] um and then beyond that I hope Beyond
[64:14] number go up keeping the wealth like
[64:16] I've been describing and like I would
[64:17] highly encourage people to check out a
[64:18] Bitcoin advisor the most important thing
[64:20] of all is how to Steward that right like
[64:22] it doesn't matter if you save a Bitcoin
[64:25] for each your kids and your kids grow up
[64:27] to be immoral degenerate you
[64:30] know people it's like they're going to
[64:33] squander the wealth the wealth will be
[64:35] gone and what was it for your
[64:38] descendants have no money they have no
[64:40] morals they have nothing to stand on
[64:42] like what was it all for right so you
[64:44] know I I I highly encourage people
[64:47] to accelerate their Bitcoin education to
[64:50] Peace of Mind as quick as possible
[64:51] because what I really want I don't
[64:53] really want people to buy more Bitcoin
[64:55] and everyone get rich in Bitcoin I want
[64:57] people to buy their time back because I
[64:59] firmly believe people are about to have
[65:02] a lot more free time on their hands in
[65:03] the next few decades more than anything
[65:05] else in human history and so I think the
[65:07] question is how are we going to Steward
[65:09] that power are we going to Steward that
[65:10] power with entertainment and and
[65:13] distractions and have people go their
[65:15] whole lives um have done have having
[65:19] done nothing of substance and nothing of
[65:22] temporal or Eternal value um or people
[65:26] going to have that time back because
[65:28] they've been freed from the parasitic
[65:31] time suck of zero some wealth inequality
[65:34] and fiat currency and they're going to
[65:37] take that time and they're going to be
[65:39] able to magnify works and virtues in
[65:42] their life so I guess that's my hope for
[65:44] people is that I think we should be
[65:46] wildly bullish on bitcoin price I think
[65:49] we should be wildly bullish on bitcoin
[65:52] scams law fair and attacks coming after
[65:54] OG bitcoiners which is everybody
[65:56] watching this um and I say bullish you
[65:58] know meaning that I guess you're bearish
[66:00] I don't know if that's bullish or
[66:01] bearish right bearish on PE I guess I'm
[66:04] bullish on people losing more Bitcoin
[66:05] bullish on the scams which is I guess a
[66:09] bearish emotional sentiment but anyway
[66:12] um but then of course most importantly I
[66:14] think it's the big question right now
[66:16] the question is what is money the next
[66:18] question we're all going to face is what
[66:21] do we do now in the face that we know
[66:23] money right now that now that you're
[66:25] rich now retired now that you have more
[66:27] money than you can imagine right if you
[66:28] have half a Bitcoin you're going to have
[66:30] more money than you can imagine in 20 30
[66:32] years it's like okay now what now what
[66:34] do you do I mean I think that's the big
[66:36] question I think some people are going
[66:38] to squander that maybe even most people
[66:40] will squander that but my hope is to get
[66:42] as many people as possible to not
[66:45] frankly throw their life away and to do
[66:48] something that is of temporal and
[66:51] eternal significance for themselves and
[66:53] for their loved ones so anyway hopefully
[66:58] we all can move the needle a little bit
[67:00] in that
[67:02] direction I guess with with great power
[67:04] comes great responsibility yeah for sure
[67:07] for sure and and it it is at times I'm
[67:09] very optimistic at times you're very
[67:10] pessimistic right you know a lot of
[67:12] bitcoiners understand that power frankly
[67:14] most of them don't because if they
[67:16] understood the power they wouldn't have
[67:17] Bitcoin exchanges yet they do um you
[67:21] know like if you have your Bitcoin and
[67:22] exchanges you don't understand Bitcoin
[67:25] like like you you are actively being
[67:26] hypocrite to yourself like like this
[67:28] isn't some trivial issue like you
[67:30] fundamentally don't understand what you
[67:32] have here or the risk you're in right if
[67:33] you got Bitcoin exchanges is going to be
[67:36] taken from you right the majority is
[67:38] going to rebel and and vote the
[67:40] government into power to see your
[67:41] Bitcoin or you have your exchange app on
[67:44] your phone somebody's going to swipe
[67:46] your phone over lunch and and withdraw
[67:48] your Bitcoin for you because they took
[67:49] it more seriously than you did or you're
[67:51] going to get some other attacked or the
[67:53] exchange will go down you know whatever
[67:55] and so yeah with great power comes great
[67:57] responsibility and I I I wish more
[68:00] people in Fiat world would take that
[68:04] warning and adopt Bitcoin but 99% of
[68:07] them won't I wish people in Bitcoin
[68:10] would take their Bitcoin self- custody
[68:11] seriously and frankly 90% of them I
[68:14] don't think are to the degree they
[68:16] probably should and probably 90% of the
[68:19] people that even are taking that
[68:21] seriously you know are they taking
[68:23] everything else in life super seriously
[68:25] I don't know including fun right life is
[68:28] fun life is an adventure and uh we can't
[68:30] change the outcome all we can do is um
[68:33] do the best of our ability and so
[68:36] hopefully um I guess hopefully this is
[68:39] inspiration for people to aim higher aim
[68:42] higher with their stacking goal aim
[68:43] higher with stacking more Bitcoin and
[68:44] aim higher at increasing their life and
[68:48] increasing the lives of those they care
[68:51] about I love that a lot really really
[68:53] cool we have endro dat in the podcast
[68:55] where previous PR guest is asking a
[68:56] question for the for the next guest and
[68:58] your question from the previous guest is
[69:00] what is the biggest bear case uh for for
[69:03] Bitcoin actually that's very related um
[69:06] uh the biggest bease is that something
[69:08] bad happens to the world right um you
[69:10] know if the hope with you know with
[69:13] Bitcoin again we talked about wealth
[69:15] inequality a lot or or at least I
[69:17] rambled about it a lot um you know so
[69:19] the ultimate bull case for Bitcoin is
[69:21] that the world gets richer the ultimate
[69:23] bare case for Bitcoin is that the world
[69:24] gets poorer right you have no need for a
[69:27] smartphone in ancient Rome right because
[69:29] you literally can't use it there's no
[69:31] point right there technological systems
[69:33] paradigms that just cannot overlap with
[69:34] each other you can't have the
[69:36] electricity internet uh microchip age at
[69:39] the same time as as you know the the
[69:42] time with goat herders and Emperors and
[69:44] Gladiators in the Coliseum it's just
[69:46] like technologically they can't overlap
[69:48] and so the big bease for Bitcoin is that
[69:51] Human Society degrades to whatever for
[69:55] what reason to whatever extent um and it
[69:58] ceases to have the need for Bitcoin
[70:00] because yes it is true not everybody in
[70:02] the world right now needs Bitcoin there
[70:03] are millions if not a billion people
[70:06] that need other things more than Bitcoin
[70:08] right you know we' like to say Bitcoin
[70:10] is for everyone and it is for everyone
[70:12] in the right time but right now you know
[70:15] like people that are starving they don't
[70:17] have enough Bitcoin right like they they
[70:19] they got to worry about next week first
[70:21] before Bitcoin right and we can say oh
[70:22] that shorttime preference whatever it's
[70:24] like no in that case short time
[70:25] preference is what matters because
[70:27] they're dealing with a shorttime
[70:28] preference problem they don't have a
[70:28] problem over the next 30 years of Fiat
[70:30] to basement they have a problem of their
[70:31] children are going to starve in the next
[70:32] two weeks if they don't get more money
[70:35] right so uh so that is the biggest
[70:37] threat to bitcoin is is that the world
[70:40] degrades and we no longer have longtime
[70:44] preference problems Bitcoin is a
[70:46] longtime preference solution but if for
[70:48] whatever reason we had some sort of
[70:49] global war or an asteroid was going to
[70:51] destroy the Earth or whatever obviously
[70:54] those would be the biggest threats
[70:56] uh I I think to bitcoin Bitcoin itself I
[70:58] don't see any risk um you know quantum
[71:01] computers is something a lot of
[71:03] bitcoiners get wrong um and it's
[71:05] something a lot of
[71:06] people it's shocking to me but
[71:08] unfortunately most people get this wrong
[71:10] but with chronic computers you know
[71:12] technically technically it could be a
[71:14] threat if it accelerated fast enough I
[71:16] mean really it's not why is it not
[71:17] because bitcoin's going to upgrade right
[71:18] bitcoin's going to upgrade it
[71:19] everything's going to be Quantum proof
[71:20] it's all going to be fine right and
[71:21] obviously many more things would be at
[71:23] risk like you know nuclear launch codes
[71:25] if qu computers were around right but
[71:26] what people forget is that like it's a
[71:29] matter of time until the Lost Bitcoin
[71:30] get found by quing computers right if we
[71:32] upgrade Bitcoin to be Quantum resistant
[71:34] in the future and and keys um you know
[71:37] especially a lot of the older Keys uh
[71:39] you know like if you lost your coins and
[71:41] you don't and you don't any longer
[71:42] control the Bitcoin then obviously once
[71:45] Bitcoin upgrades to Quantum everyone
[71:47] upgrades to Quantum you know large
[71:48] governments have Quant computers or
[71:49] whatever like they're going to be found
[71:52] right like satoshi's coins are probably
[71:53] going to be found other lost coins are
[71:55] probably going to be found right because
[71:57] if you lost the keys you inherently
[71:58] can't move those Bitcoin to a Quantum
[72:00] resistant place in you know the the
[72:03] Cyber Universe And So eventually they're
[72:05] going to be found right and so you I I I
[72:07] say that as a smaller there's a lot more
[72:10] Nu there I'm glossing over but that is a
[72:12] smaller portion on the larger umbrella
[72:14] that there are just so many threats in
[72:15] the future that we can't know and so
[72:18] maybe there's a threat to bitcoin we can
[72:22] find um but I I think it's Quantum I
[72:26] don't think I I don't think there's any
[72:28] real threat I can see I mean that's
[72:32] really the only big internal threat I
[72:34] can see that is you know somebody in the
[72:37] future with quantum computers discovers
[72:39] a million lost Bitcoin they dump it on
[72:41] the market and that crashes price but I
[72:42] mean you know they may not even dump it
[72:44] right because they have an expense they
[72:45] need to hold the Bitcoin right so they
[72:46] may not even that they may even be a
[72:47] non-trivial concern even in the worst
[72:50] case that's just a small concern um you
[72:53] know so there's minor quot quote threats
[72:56] internally but I think the only real
[72:58] threat is externally that the world
[73:01] degrades to a certain point where um we
[73:04] don't have a need for um Bitcoin anymore
[73:08] because we don't have 10year problems we
[73:11] have 10mth problems um but the optimism
[73:15] and all that is that you know in 2022 we
[73:17] had our first first tests of of changing
[73:22] the trajectory of an asteroid so you
[73:25] know we literally know how to change the
[73:27] trajectory of an asteroid uh but we
[73:29] don't yet know how we could kill Bitcoin
[73:33] even with futuristic technology like
[73:35] quantum computers or future future
[73:38] weapons of war right even if we
[73:40] developed a mega weapon more powerful
[73:42] than a nuclear bomb that doesn't kill
[73:43] Bitcoin even if we had quantum computers
[73:46] theoretically the worst we could do is
[73:48] discover a couple million loss of
[73:49] Bitcoin dump the price for maybe a year
[73:52] you know I mean like we don't know even
[73:54] with envisioning future technology we
[73:56] don't yet know how to kill Bitcoin kill
[73:58] ourselves and so the biggest threat to
[74:00] bitcoin is that we kill ourselves and we
[74:03] kill um the rest of the world so but in
[74:06] that case obviously we have bigger
[74:08] problems more important problems than
[74:09] Bitcoin um because Bitcoin is a tool to
[74:12] help people and so if there are no more
[74:14] people the tool is worthless so um like
[74:18] that's also the four different tangents
[74:20] in there you know that we could go on
[74:22] about but I I I won't because I know
[74:23] I've talked enough
[74:26] no it was really really cool L that and
[74:28] I think I guess it also comes down and
[74:31] that's what also I always is my um
[74:34] takeaway from the be cases of Bitcoin in
[74:37] all the really realistic be cases is
[74:39] like yeah um we don't need Bitcoin yeah
[74:42] right exactly then like if electricity
[74:45] is is gone or something like that like
[74:47] then we have bigger problems than yeah
[74:49] yeah money like we we need a maybe a gun
[74:51] or something like that in our house but
[74:53] yeah really cool um I love the podcast
[74:56] with you it was really really cool um
[74:57] when people now want to check you out
[74:59] ask your questions reach out to you

[75:33] what you're looking for if you want
[75:35] Bitcoin in retirement accounts uh we can
[75:38] do that self- custody for you if you

[75:43] countries we can do that for you if you
[75:44] want to help your small business your
[75:46] large business your church your family I
[75:48] understand Bitcoin we can help you do
[75:50] that and if you just want to buy as much

[75:57] Bitcoin like please just reach out
[75:59] because I get it I know you want to do
[76:01] it but let's just talk about it because
[76:04] the worst things I've seen personally
[76:05] are when people borrow money to buy
[76:07] Bitcoin then they lose the underlying
[76:09] asset the Bitcoin and now they're left
[76:11] with a lot of debt and you know so again
