[00:00] we have this Mission you can get on
[00:01] board and it's going to be rough but if
[00:03] you get what we get then come join us
[00:06] and let's go do this thing happiness is
[00:08] better shared if everything goes
[00:09] according to the hyperbitcoinization
[00:10] plan like you are going to be the person
[00:13] in your group of 30 or 40 people with
[00:14] this incredibly High net worth that you
[00:17] could provide generational wealth to for
[00:19] 30 40 people and you can either just
[00:21] give them the Bitcoin and buy them
[00:22] houses or you can be a leader and
[00:24] instruct them on how to be Sovereign or
[00:26] how to you know come together as a Unity
[00:27] you can't really have freedom of speech
[00:29] if you're just relying on a government
[00:31] to grant you that right the only way
[00:33] that you truly have freedom of speech is
[00:34] if you become a sovereign individual
[00:36] yourself not ever putting all your eggs
[00:38] in a one basket in terms of what your
[00:39] skill sets are it's trying to learn as
[00:41] many skills as you can to be Sovereign
[00:43] people are increasingly feeling
[00:44] powerless because they can't have
[00:46] property rights it's just one person you
[00:48] care about at a time getting them out of
[00:50] that Fiat system the New Frontier is the
[00:52] internet there is real estate on the
[00:54] internet and that's what bitcoiners are
[00:55] doing is they're saying hey I'm stacking
[00:56] the SATs and now I have a stake in this
[00:59] new monetary system if you get to a
[01:00] state where you're saying more
[01:02] statements at a ratio of like 10 to1
[01:04] than you are asking questions then you
[01:06] should take a look at
[01:07] [Music]
[01:10] yourself are you nomadic and move around
[01:13] a lot or you have a home base it feels
[01:15] like I'm nomadic lately I think this
[01:18] year I have not been at home for at
[01:20] least two and a half almost three months
[01:21] I've been to Madera we were just in
[01:24] Nashville New York Chicago Savannah
[01:28] Georgia I've been down at Cancun
[01:30] I'm going to Japan in a few weeks um who
[01:34] knows from there um but it's fun like
[01:36] that is kind of the unique situation
[01:39] I've been put in is that I can do my
[01:42] part to give to the Bitcoin community
[01:44] and also travel the world and learn
[01:46] about different cultures and the hope is
[01:48] that I can bring all those lessons that
[01:49] I've taken from my travels and bring
[01:52] them into the videos I love it a lot
[01:54] really cool and you're also the the
[01:56] co-founder of of get based so with that
[01:58] we can directly uh start into that um I
[02:02] Heard the the get based like being based
[02:06] that term uh before not that much now I
[02:09] hear it all the time since since I heard
[02:11] you saying it and and the company that
[02:13] you build it um what's your definition
[02:16] of based like what what what's a based
[02:18] person what's what's the definition of
[02:20] the the
[02:21] term um I think it's about being
[02:24] unapologetically authentic so people
[02:28] have different definitions as to like is
[02:30] a based opinion usually in the context
[02:32] of the Internet it's like maybe a
[02:34] controversial opinion that holds like a
[02:36] lot of truth but people are afraid to
[02:37] say for me for the individual it is
[02:39] about like if you have a strong opinion
[02:41] about something it's about standing by
[02:43] that opinion through thick and thin not
[02:45] letting the tides of like social change
[02:48] or you know a majority of other people's
[02:50] opinions change what you really think
[02:52] about something so yeah it's about just
[02:55] it based it's literally just means
[02:56] grounded so grounding yourself in the
[02:58] things that you actually believe and the
[02:59] value that you believe which basically
[03:02] would say like almost every bitcoiner is
[03:05] is based as long as he's he's in open
[03:08] bitcoiner right I think so I I think the
[03:11] bitcoiners really take to that term a
[03:13] little bit more because I think that
[03:17] Bitcoin itself is a protocol based on
[03:20] like undeniable truths you know in
[03:23] mathematics The Ledger once a block is
[03:25] confirmed it's it's the truth forever
[03:27] basically um and so bitcoiners like to
[03:30] ground themselves in you know as much
[03:33] truth as they can there's a lot of
[03:35] subjectivity in life um you know where
[03:37] you can debate whether something is good
[03:39] or bad um but there's also a lot of
[03:41] objectivity and I think what bitcoiners
[03:43] gravitate towards is like finding that
[03:45] objective truth the objec of good in the
[03:46] world and trying to promote it out to as
[03:48] many people as possible and share those
[03:50] values and sometimes those things that
[03:52] we view as objective good are things
[03:55] that are not so Savory uh right like in
[03:58] the in the you know Public public sphere
[04:01] we we might be pushing things like
[04:03] personal responsibility the fact that
[04:05] maybe we shouldn't blame the government
[04:07] or the fed or the other political party
[04:09] for everything and that we should take
[04:10] responsibility for ourselves that might
[04:12] not be something that everybody wants to
[04:13] hear but I think that's a pretty based
[04:15] thing to say ultimately responsibility
[04:17] lies as much as humanly possible with
[04:19] the individual for the outcome of their
[04:21] actions um and yeah long story short
[04:24] that's that's what I think Bas is all
[04:26] about do do you feel like the saying
[04:29] what you want and being uh truthful to
[04:32] yourself and truthful to to the world
[04:34] especially online and is is is that
[04:38] freedom of speech kind of in in danger
[04:40] or is it even even there I think I mean
[04:42] we have act that's kind of get got a
[04:45] little bit more free uh but there's also
[04:48] nostro where you can really freely speak
[04:50] uh but there's not the mainstream crowd
[04:52] on nostr so there like nobody not not so
[04:55] many people are listening there is that
[04:57] in danger I think I also heard a little
[04:58] bit about the UK doing something but I
[05:01] did not look into it deeply if you
[05:03] looked into it deeply but uh I think
[05:05] there someone got arrested for saying
[05:07] something online I did not look deeply
[05:09] what they did but um what's your opinion
[05:12] here yeah I mean freedom of speech is
[05:14] something that I think every society
[05:17] should um work towards to attain but it
[05:20] also is not in the best interest of
[05:22] every single Society I know that that
[05:25] kind of sounds a little bit weird but
[05:26] like there are people who live under
[05:28] dictatorships there are people that live
[05:30] in very highly religious countries where
[05:32] total freedom of speech is just not
[05:34] tolerated by the majority of the
[05:36] population they do not want people to
[05:38] speak their mind because they feel like
[05:40] it might hinder their religion or it
[05:41] might hinder another belief um in the
[05:44] west we say that we value it a lot you
[05:46] know we we have it enshrined in the
[05:48] constitution in the United States I
[05:50] don't know what Canada's version of this
[05:52] is I don't think that we have like the
[05:54] same freedom of speech protections I
[05:55] think we're a little bit more aligned
[05:56] with the UK which yeah it's been a bit
[05:58] more controversial you can't you know
[06:00] slander certain entities I guess um but
[06:03] ultimately like these things that we
[06:04] call Human Rights like freedom of speech
[06:07] these things rest in the individual and
[06:09] you can't really have freedom of speech
[06:11] if you're just relying on a government
[06:13] to grant you that right the only way
[06:15] that you truly have freedom of speech is
[06:17] if you become a sovereign individual
[06:19] yourself if I'm in America and I can get
[06:22] fired I can get my bank account my my
[06:24] basic ability to
[06:26] transact M money censored because I say
[06:29] something that falls under the guys of
[06:30] freedom of speech but it's just not
[06:31] liked by middlemen that essentially
[06:33] control everything um that I don't
[06:35] really have freedom of speech right like
[06:37] if I cannot say certain political views
[06:39] without fear of losing my employment
[06:41] with fear of being let go from a certain
[06:44] school with fear of being let go from a
[06:46] certain family like it's not it's not
[06:48] really a human right is it right I'm not
[06:50] re I'm not really given that right like
[06:52] yeah I'm giv that right but with the
[06:54] expense of all the consequences of
[06:55] possibly being alienated from everyone
[06:57] so freedom of speech again it's not fre
[06:59] from consequence it's about being able
[07:01] to say what you you know want to say in
[07:03] a public sphere without the fear of um
[07:06] you know retaliation or without the fear
[07:09] of of being needlessly censored But
[07:11] ultimately like we can enshrine these
[07:13] things in in founding documents but they
[07:15] are not you know immovable laws like the
[07:17] laws of gravity or or the laws of
[07:19] physics right uh it's to each their own
[07:21] and I think it's all about as an
[07:23] individual you have to harness the right
[07:25] people around you and you have to
[07:26] harness the right Tools around you to
[07:28] actually be able to exercise things like
[07:30] freedom of speech as much as possible
[07:32] that's what Bitcoin enables right I love
[07:34] it a lot um what are you doing to to be
[07:37] as Sovereign as possible you liveing in
[07:39] Canada yes what can we do to to be or
[07:42] what are you doing to be as Sovereign
[07:45] and as Untouchable as possible it's
[07:48] tough I think it really depends you know
[07:50] I I don't think my lifestyle is
[07:52] necessarily for everyone but what is it
[07:54] to be Sovereign to be Sovereign is to to
[07:56] have as many tools as possible on your
[07:58] tool belt of being able to survive
[08:00] basically right what are survival skills
[08:02] well being able to feed yourself um
[08:05] being able to take care and raise a
[08:08] family you know to raise others or to
[08:10] you know have personal responsibility to
[08:12] be able to craft things I think with
[08:14] your hands to to be able to speak
[08:16] fluently and persuasively in order to
[08:18] you know get the things that you need or
[08:20] want or to negotiate properly in certain
[08:23] situations um you know to have the
[08:25] freedom to transact to be Sovereign you
[08:27] have to not be able to have one singular
[08:30] choke point to your transactional
[08:32] capabilities I I think it's like it's
[08:34] all about not ever putting all your eggs
[08:36] into one basket in terms of what your
[08:38] skill sets are it's trying to learn as
[08:39] many skills as you can to be Sovereign
[08:42] um on the other hand and this is like a
[08:44] really important thing that I I've taken
[08:46] away is like as much as we might aspire
[08:49] to be Sovereign individuals we we cannot
[08:51] possibly flourish on our Lonesome we
[08:53] have to learn how to cooperate with
[08:55] other people we have to learn how to
[08:57] barter how to exchange our time and
[08:59] goods and energy and how to value and
[09:01] price out that energy uh that we
[09:03] exchange with other people who can do
[09:05] things that maybe we can't because of
[09:07] physical circumstances or just Talent or
[09:09] other abilities we don't have you know
[09:11] if we want to listen to music for
[09:13] example or Sovereign individuals like we
[09:14] have to find someone who can play us
[09:15] music or we have to purchase music or we
[09:17] get it for free off the internet we
[09:18] still got to pay for that internet with
[09:20] something right so you have to be able
[09:22] to be good at exchanging your time for
[09:24] the things that you want and being able
[09:27] to create as many things as you can with
[09:29] your own time is also a big
[09:31] plus yeah it's an interesting
[09:33] conversation because uh like total
[09:36] freedom means you are alone in this
[09:38] world because there's always like
[09:39] dependency on on other people uh there's
[09:42] a like irent or there's a landlord who
[09:45] who knows where I live and and knows
[09:47] some details about me like that's like a
[09:49] a major dependency that that I have and
[09:52] there's so many other things that we are
[09:53] depending on like if you really want to
[09:56] be 100% free and independent of every
[09:59] you basically have to live in the woods
[10:01] and and eat from from the grass and and
[10:03] from the from animals that come by you
[10:06] like that and even there you are kind of
[10:09] depending on something to to find
[10:11] something for for food and maybe there
[10:14] uh you need a second person that looks
[10:16] out for you when you sleep like I think
[10:18] the the the the concept of of full
[10:20] freedom is an interesting one because um
[10:23] we don't want to be 100% free this means
[10:26] that we are 100% reli on ourselves like
[10:29] it's good that we cooperate and and and
[10:32] have have some dependencies uh between
[10:34] each other and uh that's that's really
[10:36] good but then we come to other yeah
[10:39] please go ahead well this might be a
[10:40] really good segue because I used to to
[10:43] have that and I think this is something
[10:45] I I like to talk about like difference
[10:47] between Sexes and genders and and like
[10:49] you know what makes men different from
[10:50] women I think one thing that makes men
[10:53] very distinctly different from women and
[10:55] there might be some exceptions to this
[10:56] is that every guy that I know of has had
[11:00] a dream of just like ripping up the
[11:02] passport ripping up the ID booking it
[11:04] into the woods with a gun and just
[11:05] trying to see if they could survive I
[11:07] don't think many women like dream of
[11:09] that or even think about it but like
[11:11] every guy I know has kind of thought
[11:12] about doing that once some of them have
[11:14] tried it some version of that um and
[11:17] it's a very like isolationist kind of
[11:19] thing but I think we all go through it
[11:21] as we grow up and we become men like
[11:23] this this idea that like screw it like
[11:25] maybe I just don't need everyone else
[11:27] and I can just do it on my own but I
[11:29] think part of becoming a man and
[11:31] becoming a grown adult is learning that
[11:33] personal responsibility having people
[11:36] rely on you and you relying on other
[11:38] people is not necessarily A Bad Thing
[11:40] and and one of my favorite movies um
[11:42] I'll try not to spoil it too much my
[11:44] favorite movie of all time it's this
[11:45] movie called into the wild um it's based
[11:48] off of the true story of Christopher
[11:49] mandalis this kid who basically did that
[11:51] he chopped up his ID his passport just
[11:54] after graduating college I believe a
[11:56] really smart kid decides to hitchhike up
[11:59] up across America all the way up to
[12:00] Alaska and try and like survive in the
[12:02] wilderness there and uh you know the end
[12:05] of the story is him basically learning
[12:07] that happiness is better shared right
[12:10] life is better shared you cannot enjoy
[12:13] the fruits and really take for granted
[12:14] everything that the world has to offer
[12:16] if you try and do it all by yourself um
[12:19] and uh so there's that there's that
[12:21] balance between like I want to be a
[12:22] sovereign as Sovereign an individual as
[12:24] possible I don't want to rely on my
[12:26] parents or my my my girlfriend or my
[12:28] wife or my friend like I want to be able
[12:29] to do everything myself but also
[12:31] realizing that it's good that you have
[12:33] those things and the reason that you
[12:34] have those things that you can rely on
[12:36] other people for is because you're also
[12:37] giving them something in return that
[12:39] they probably can't get elsewhere that's
[12:41] an interesting thing yeah the the topic
[12:43] of of chenda is really interesting I
[12:46] never covered it on the podcast I think
[12:48] that it would be great to to dive into
[12:50] that
[12:52] um I will just I will just ask that and
[12:55] I think we can get from there why are
[12:58] there only two
[13:00] why are there only two genders I don't
[13:02] know it's like this is a long this is a
[13:05] long thing it's like look you you you
[13:07] want to call yourself like you you are
[13:09] entitled to label yourself whatever you
[13:11] want nobody else has to take your
[13:14] definition seriously right like you know
[13:17] you can say I am a uh you know I am a a
[13:20] woman and if you call me a man you're
[13:21] like misgendering me it's like okay like
[13:24] so be it like I'm going to be
[13:25] misgendering you for the rest of your
[13:26] life because you look like a dude to me
[13:29] um and there's a double standard where
[13:31] like you can't call yourself black or
[13:33] you can't call yourself 20 when you're
[13:35] age like 60 it's like look you the
[13:38] physical features you are you have your
[13:40] definitions of them of of who you are
[13:42] and then you have public perception
[13:44] definitions of who you are um and you
[13:46] can't change what other people think you
[13:48] can try you can try under force of law
[13:50] that's the craziest part about all this
[13:52] you know gender stuff is like they are
[13:54] trying to give individuals through
[13:55] through the power of law the the ability
[13:58] to change what other people's
[13:59] definitions are of yourself which is
[14:01] crazy it's like if I wanted my pronouns
[14:03] to be like handsome and smart um you
[14:06] know and if you don't call me those you
[14:08] go to jail like that seems absurd but if
[14:10] you if if I want my pronouns to be like
[14:12] she her and you don't call me those you
[14:15] do go to jail in certain countries right
[14:17] it's like where are these how many
[14:19] pronouns are there where are they coming
[14:20] from like who invents what the
[14:22] definition of a pronoun is it's all it's
[14:23] all kind of crazy but it's all a
[14:25] distraction that's the big thing it's
[14:28] all one one gigantic distraction from
[14:31] the fact that our time and our energy is
[14:33] being robbed um I look at all these like
[14:36] social and cultural issues and it's like
[14:41] guys like if we spent just like a tenth
[14:43] of the energy if the conservatives and
[14:45] the Liberals spent just a tenth of the
[14:47] energy that they spend fighting over
[14:48] abortion law if they spent a tenth of
[14:51] the energy that they spend fighting over
[14:52] like misgendering or mis pronoun on just
[14:55] learning how money Works which is the
[14:58] actual most important thing because
[14:59] that's what we're all we all have in
[15:01] common we're all working towards is to
[15:02] ACR value with our time if you just
[15:05] spend a tenth of that time working
[15:06] towards understanding that stuff we
[15:08] would find way more common ground we
[15:10] would actually get to solving some of
[15:12] these um these cultural issues because
[15:13] we would be grounded in in a singular
[15:16] Mission which is to preserve the value
[15:17] of our time our legacies but instead you
[15:20] know media implantation uh you know
[15:24] humans that just get riled up by stuff
[15:26] like we just spend our time on silly
[15:27] stuff and uh as a bitcoiner that's like
[15:30] that's the orange pill thing right like
[15:31] you take the pill and then you get to
[15:32] see it all from the outside um that's
[15:35] you know what we're all in it for is we
[15:37] want to orange pill the world that they
[15:38] can start to see all these issues
[15:40] through a different lens altoe and see
[15:42] them for the distractions or the noise
[15:43] that they are and try and coral as many
[15:45] people as possible to actually work
[15:47] towards a common human goal which is to
[15:50] preserve the value that we create with
[15:51] our time absolutely yeah is that would
[15:55] you say is this uh gender and and all
[15:59] those things that you just just
[16:00] described something that comes from Fe
[16:03] or it's actually like an kind of a
[16:06] distraction from the Fiat system like is
[16:09] is is is the Fiat system a cause of that
[16:12] because uh the cheap money people are
[16:14] acting out uh uh because of reasons and
[16:17] and or is it an actual like distraction
[16:20] from that that we don't get to see the
[16:22] the real
[16:23] thing I think there's like some
[16:25] intentional manufacturing of
[16:29] this like not knowing your identity
[16:31] thing but I do think it's a symptom of a
[16:33] system that perpetually robs from people
[16:36] and I guess like just give me a second I
[16:38] kind of like think this through because
[16:39] I don't want to I want to get it kind of
[16:40] concise I think
[16:42] essentially
[16:44] um people are increasingly feeling
[16:47] powerless because they can't have
[16:49] property rights right it is almost
[16:51] impossible to own the things that our
[16:53] parents own Like Houses like cars and
[16:56] the things that we do get in you know
[16:59] now that our parents didn't degrees we
[17:01] have to accumulate debt towards another
[17:03] entity too so we not only have like um a
[17:08] lack of property rights we have negative
[17:09] property rights because everybody is in
[17:11] debt and when you have negative property
[17:13] rights when you feel like you don't
[17:14] really own the labor of your time and
[17:16] and then all the energy of your time is
[17:18] going towards paying off something that
[17:20] you did in the past like you feel like a
[17:23] slave you feel like you don't have
[17:25] individuality you feel like you're a cog
[17:26] in the machine just working to pay off a
[17:29] degree or a car debt or whatever and so
[17:32] it's no surprise to me that like in this
[17:34] world where people feel like you know
[17:37] they're basically being imprisoned by a
[17:38] monetary system that they lash out and
[17:41] try and find some semblance of meaning
[17:43] in different sorts of communities right
[17:45] and so maybe my way of coping with the
[17:47] fact that all of my time is being stolen
[17:50] uh by a debt-based system is by thinking
[17:53] that I am somebody else thinking that
[17:55] I'm a different
[17:56] gender connecting with other people that
[17:59] are trying to just be a part of a
[18:02] different system altogether and so when
[18:04] I see all these different movements of
[18:05] like different gender identities when
[18:07] people join Cults and all these things
[18:09] it's just it's just people's way of of
[18:12] trying to feel like they aren't just
[18:13] like a cog in the system that they
[18:14] aren't just like replaceable they want
[18:15] to feel like they're a part of something
[18:17] bigger you know and and when I I when I
[18:19] see people that you know get all the
[18:22] hormones and stuff I don't think that
[18:24] they're like you can argue that they're
[18:26] they're mentally ill and things like
[18:28] that but I think are just people that
[18:29] are looking for meaning and these
[18:31] communities of like lgbtq and all that
[18:34] they're like very very supportive like
[18:36] you have a family in these people we
[18:38] might look at them as like strange but
[18:41] like go and listen to the camaraderie
[18:43] that is in these groups go and listen to
[18:45] the camaraderie that is in certain Cults
[18:47] like it gives you something to Aspire
[18:48] for it gives you rules it gives you like
[18:51] energy um it's just not in the way that
[18:53] maybe us bitcoiners you know would say
[18:55] is the optimal way of getting that but I
[18:57] think that's why people seek these
[18:58] things out right they want to feel a
[18:59] part of something everybody is is dying
[19:02] for meaning we've just had meaning
[19:03] sapped from us because we're just
[19:05] enslaved right and so it's just
[19:08] different people gravitate towards
[19:09] different things um the thing is is that
[19:12] people just don't get the root of why
[19:13] we're enslaved and if if we got that if
[19:15] we get on to a common ground where we
[19:17] understand that this is a system that's
[19:19] enslaving us we could all come together
[19:21] and work to undo that system but
[19:22] unfortunately like we just want to get
[19:24] through the next day and it's so hard to
[19:26] pull people um in the direction of
[19:28] actually fighting the system and working
[19:30] towards this long longterm solution that
[19:33] will require a lot of sacrifice to get
[19:36] right how long do you think this this uh
[19:40] can last I I feel like the this this
[19:43] fear system is there's like one it has a
[19:46] major Network effect to it like people
[19:49] are really used to it and and they are
[19:51] like if you are today like 45 years old
[19:55] uh you only lived in the FIA system and
[19:57] and you know okay okay that that thing
[20:00] that I have in my hand which is has no
[20:02] value at all has value like you learned
[20:04] that from from the day you were born um
[20:08] it's it's maybe maybe it's different for
[20:09] people that are like born like five 10
[20:11] years ago because they always lived in a
[20:13] world where at least the alternative
[20:16] existed uh and and something that was
[20:19] not like
[20:20] gold even though gold is an alternative
[20:23] to that but uh not really suitable for
[20:25] digital and Global World um how long do
[20:29] you think can this this feat system this
[20:31] fear monster um live and is is or will
[20:36] it ever be like defeated if we stay in
[20:39] that term honestly like I'll give you my
[20:41] real honest opinion on this is I don't
[20:44] know and frankly like I don't care
[20:49] like we can postulate on how long the
[20:51] system is going to last or we can just
[20:53] pretend that it's already over and just
[20:55] try and bring as many people as we can
[20:57] to a parallel system that's what Jeff
[21:00] Booth talks about right like this is the
[21:02] one thing that frustrates me about
[21:03] bitcoiners a lot of the time is like the
[21:06] the bull case for their freedom is that
[21:10] like everything collapses around them
[21:13] like Fiat finally collapses the wool is
[21:15] finally removed like we finally have the
[21:17] revolution we end the central banks it's
[21:18] like we know these things can go on over
[21:21] and over and we know human psychology we
[21:23] know these patterns of like corralling
[21:26] people like leaders will always be able
[21:28] to instill fear in enough people to get
[21:30] you know the things that they want so
[21:32] for me it's like I don't concern myself
[21:35] with when this system might collapse
[21:38] temporarily before it's you know rebuilt
[21:41] a new all over again I worry or I don't
[21:44] worry but I think mostly about who are
[21:46] the people in my life that I really
[21:48] really care about and how can I get them
[21:50] out of this system as easily as possible
[21:53] and are they willing to open their minds
[21:56] and come out of the system with me and
[21:58] and like
[21:59] I think when I had that shift of thought
[22:00] of like you know when is the macro going
[22:02] to change to like you know when can I
[22:04] change my friends and family or or when
[22:06] are they going to take the leap to to
[22:08] try and do what I'm doing um that's when
[22:10] I realize like those are attainable
[22:12] things I don't have to postulate or like
[22:14] theorize on when things are going to
[22:15] change I can actually just do the change
[22:17] now that's why I make the videos that I
[22:19] make that's why I talk to bitcoin with
[22:21] everyone that I know and it's just like
[22:23] it's just one person you care about at a
[22:25] time getting them out of that Fiat
[22:27] system and you make the video so that
[22:29] hopefully other people that you don't
[22:31] know directly will learn from them um
[22:33] you make the videos like I do because
[22:34] you just have fun making videos um but
[22:37] you ultimately have to care most about
[22:39] the people around you that you love the
[22:40] people around you that you respect and
[22:42] that respect you and uh just shut out
[22:46] the noise you know for the the big macro
[22:48] because nobody really knows when this
[22:49] thing is going to end you know some
[22:51] people have speculations that the US
[22:53] debt will get the GDP to debt will get
[22:55] too high or whatever it's like okay it's
[22:57] like what am I going to do with that
[22:58] right like I need to care about my
[23:00] parents and my friends like I don't not
[23:02] going to wait 40 years for this thing to
[23:03] crash in order to just tell my friends I
[23:05] told you so it's like no I'm gonna
[23:06] figure this out today as much as I
[23:09] possibly can and we'll work towards
[23:11] whatever we want to work
[23:13] towards I I love that because uh
[23:15] focusing on on building something rather
[23:18] than uh focusing on on tearing something
[23:22] down or fighting something is is way
[23:24] more productive like you it's way more
[23:25] productive to build something than to
[23:27] fight something uh because you give it
[23:29] your energy and and the thing that you
[23:31] give energy towards that that that is
[23:34] the thing that grows like if you find
[23:35] something uh the chance is that it gets
[23:38] more energy and I I like that the
[23:40] central banks and and that uh ECP in in
[23:43] the EU and and and things like that they
[23:46] they starting to fight Bitcoin this
[23:49] means they take it seriously well here's
[23:51] a good example of this is like you look
[23:52] throughout history of every time like a
[23:54] new civilization started there was like
[23:57] a Defector from the current Paradigm
[23:59] right think of like the British and the
[24:01] Americans when the American Empire
[24:03] started it was like a small faction of
[24:04] of Brits who were like yeah we don't
[24:06] like this taxation without
[24:08] representation they didn't try and like
[24:10] get everybody you know on that board
[24:13] they didn't try to persuade everybody
[24:15] that what the British government was
[24:16] doing was wrong they were like we have
[24:18] this Mission you can get on board we're
[24:21] going to cross the ocean and we're going
[24:23] to start a new country and it's going to
[24:24] be rough but if you get what we get then
[24:28] come join us and let's go do this thing
[24:31] right and so that's like the Bitcoin
[24:33] attitude unfortunately we don't have
[24:34] like you know all the land in the world
[24:36] is kind of claim so it's going to be
[24:37] hard to sort of bit Bitcoin landia but
[24:40] the New Frontier is is the internet
[24:42] there is real estate on the internet and
[24:44] that's what bitcoiners are doing is
[24:45] they're saying hey I'm stacking the SATs
[24:48] and now I have a stake in this new
[24:50] monetary system it is a bet it's not a
[24:52] sure thing Bitcoin necessarily that's
[24:54] what the bitcoiners are doing is they're
[24:55] they're pioneering they're leaving the
[24:57] British the Fiat Empire higher and
[24:59] they're going towards a Bitcoin standard
[25:01] as much as they possibly can and when
[25:02] the world is ready to join us the world
[25:04] will be ready to join us and and we will
[25:06] in some essence you know be leaders but
[25:08] hopefully Confidant in the people that
[25:10] uh you know we have in our community to
[25:13] to lead to a better place so bitcoiners
[25:16] like we don't realize this like you
[25:18] might just be a person a man or woman
[25:20] like stacking SATs passively but if
[25:22] you're consuming these podcasts and
[25:24] you're on Twitter and you're doing like
[25:26] whatever you can to support you know bit
[25:28] coins advancement like there's a very
[25:30] real possibility that like one day
[25:33] you're going to have like 20 to 30 to 40
[25:35] of your closest friends and family
[25:38] looking up to you to try and figure out
[25:40] like what to do if something comes
[25:43] crashing down let's just say like I
[25:44] again I don't like to theorize too much
[25:46] but like if you're the person who Stacks
[25:48] STS vigorously and and you work a neto5
[25:50] but you've been doing it for like three
[25:51] four years and you own like one Bitcoin
[25:55] if everything goes according to the the
[25:57] hyperbitcoinization plan like you are
[25:58] going to be the person in your group of
[26:00] 30 or 40 people with this incredibly
[26:03] High net worth that you could provide
[26:06] generational wealth to for you know 30
[26:09] 40 people and you can either just give
[26:10] them the Bitcoin and buy them houses or
[26:13] you can be a leader and instruct them on
[26:14] how to be Sovereign or how to you know
[26:17] come together as a community so I think
[26:19] we underestimate sometimes like if all
[26:21] this goes according to plan like we are
[26:23] not going to just be able to just chill
[26:25] and stay humble and stack SATs like
[26:27] we're going to have to be leaders for
[26:29] our community because we saw something
[26:31] um and we we picked up a necessary tool
[26:33] in order to you know keep our
[26:35] communities safe and
[26:37] prosperous I'm I'm very positive that
[26:40] bitcoiners and I met so many already
[26:42] with the podcast um that they will use
[26:45] their purchasing power their financial
[26:47] energy they accumulated with Bitcoin
[26:49] that they will use it for something good
[26:51] uh and productive at least that's my
[26:53] hope uh because uh that's that's that's
[26:56] the that's the thing right and and this
[26:58] is a really interesting thing because I
[27:00] I say often on the podcast that if you
[27:03] stack and you want to try to get your
[27:05] family on but they don't want to get on
[27:08] on bitcoin um be nice stack for them and
[27:12] be for be there for them if they
[27:14] actually need need you because if it
[27:17] goes to according to plan and they are
[27:19] not willing to adopt Bitcoin they will
[27:21] need you at some point uh if if your
[27:24] family isn't uh I don't know the the one
[27:27] of the richest family but even even if
[27:29] they are completely a feat system even
[27:31] if they have a great measure of wealth
[27:34] they they might still need your Bitcoin
[27:36] exactly hey what you raised is a really
[27:38] good point because if you have loving
[27:40] friends and family like really loving
[27:43] that would sacrifice things for you I
[27:44] think true friendship is people who will
[27:46] sacrifice things for you and and you
[27:48] would sacrifice things for them if we're
[27:50] all wrong about this whole Bitcoin thing
[27:52] and we end up putting all our money into
[27:53] this whole thing and it goes to zero
[27:56] like true friends and true family
[27:58] Will Not Laugh In Your Face they will
[28:00] help you get back up on your feet but if
[28:03] you're right you can change all your
[28:06] friends and family's life so you're
[28:08] taking a bet on bitcoin and yourself but
[28:11] again it's like surround yourself with
[28:12] good people because they are ultimately
[28:15] going to be there if for some reason us
[28:18] Bitcoin psychopaths are wrong you
[28:20] surround yourself with good people that
[28:21] care about you and you care about them
[28:23] like they will be there for you and you
[28:25] have that opportunity to give back if
[28:26] you're right and you should give back if
[28:28] if you're right is there anything that
[28:29] you can imagine that uh brings Bitcoin
[28:32] down at this
[28:34] point yeah it's if uh central banks
[28:36] decide tomorrow like [ __ ] it we got to
[28:39] be fiscally responsible we have children
[28:41] and grandchildren and we need to create
[28:44] sound money we need to link this to
[28:47] energy in some form maybe we don't like
[28:48] Bitcoin but we're going to do another
[28:50] Like rules based system without rulers
[28:53] and they somehow come up with like a
[28:55] really really great version of a
[28:57] decentral system that's similar to
[28:59] bitcoin but still has all like the
[29:01] decentralization that Bitcoin has I I
[29:03] know a lot of people are like well
[29:04] that's impossible that's imposs it's
[29:06] like no it's not like governments can
[29:09] also just be sound stewards of their
[29:11] community's money uh it's a country by
[29:13] country basis but I think like you know
[29:17] honestly at this point this is
[29:18] controversial take controversial take
[29:20] like four on this show I don't know how
[29:22] many have had if they're controversial
[29:24] at all but like El Salvador doesn't need
[29:26] Bitcoin you know Salvador has what you
[29:29] might argue is like a dictator but like
[29:32] you throw Bitcoin out you just imagine
[29:34] that Bitcoin law never happened like
[29:35] everything that bu Kelly was working
[29:37] towards was going to happen anyways
[29:38] right like increase safety economic
[29:40] Prosperity like Bitcoin didn't need to
[29:42] be part of his plan for that whole
[29:45] country to thrive I know that the max
[29:47] Kaisers of the world will say that like
[29:49] they're Interlink in their mandatory
[29:50] it's like no that guy had a vision for
[29:51] his people he rallied them together the
[29:53] people really wanted change it just so
[29:56] happens that Bitcoin was one of the
[29:57] things things that guy saw and maybe
[29:59] there's some like increased tourism but
[30:01] like there's no way in the world that
[30:02] you can tell me that if Bitcoin wasn't
[30:03] in his plan that that country was you
[30:05] know gon to remain in stasis with
[30:08] buchelli under the helm there's just no
[30:09] way those people picked A New Path and a
[30:11] new future for themselves when they
[30:13] elected buchelli and um you know buelli
[30:16] has carried that energy forward and and
[30:18] Bitcoin Echoes those values but it it it
[30:21] is not the sole cause of them and um
[30:25] that's that's what we need ultimately
[30:27] and if for some reason reason you start
[30:29] seeing other governments around the
[30:30] world elect real leaders and the people
[30:32] themselves decide it's time for a change
[30:34] and the people themselves themselves
[30:36] reorient themselves to have a like a a
[30:39] longtime preference then maybe we don't
[30:41] need Bitcoin right or we don't need it
[30:44] right now right we just need people that
[30:46] understand the values that Bitcoin has I
[30:48] just think that if you don't have sound
[30:50] money it's very hard to get those
[30:52] grounded values like sound money just
[30:53] incentivizes having those good values um
[30:56] and it makes it you know easier to work
[30:58] towards that but if all of a sudden we
[31:00] just get our [ __ ] together then I don't
[31:01] think that we need Bitcoin maybe
[31:04] necessarily that's an interesting
[31:06] stretch that's a
[31:07] stretch I I love it though but um uh my
[31:12] best theory that I ever heard that BR
[31:14] could bit uh bring Bitcoin down is that
[31:17] some Superior life form like aliens come
[31:19] to our planet if they come first to us
[31:21] before we come to them it's fair to say
[31:23] that they are way more advanced than us
[31:25] basically have a longer chain they have
[31:28] a better chain they have better money
[31:30] already and they force basically their
[31:32] money onto us so like that's the only
[31:36] actually uh fear and I'm like yeah that
[31:39] that sounds that sounds good I mean also
[31:41] that yours with with government um but I
[31:45] just have a really hard time that's my
[31:46] bearish thesis on gold what you just
[31:48] said it's like aliens come down to earth
[31:51] they see that we had this gold standard
[31:52] for a while maybe we're like still
[31:54] thinking about it they're like wait a
[31:55] second like we know this like Planet ROM
[31:58] it has a ton of gold like we could just
[31:59] take over these chimps you know they
[32:03] can't do that with Bitcoin but you know
[32:05] maybe they'll just blow up the planet
[32:06] and then Bitcoin doesn't exist right so
[32:09] that that that's true yeah really
[32:11] interesting but uh yeah on another note
[32:15] uh you made uh together with Issa and
[32:18] Adam a lot of documentaries and they're
[32:21] really good like they are high quality
[32:23] they're not just like oh yeah 50 minutes
[32:24] video talking the way that I do it but
[32:27] really like high quality and a lot of
[32:30] work into the every minute of of of the
[32:32] videos um what did you uh learn from
[32:36] from those I saw some with like you made
[32:38] something with Michael sailor uh where
[32:41] you uh made like a person I think that
[32:43] was like half an hour long like really
[32:45] in deep uh then you like Vancouver in
[32:48] with the Bitcoin City and some others I
[32:50] saw I think Peru I talked with with Isa
[32:53] about that um really interesting where
[32:55] you made a lot of research probably with
[32:57] that that and the other two is is it
[33:00] just the three of you or is there more
[33:02] is there a team behind actually well
[33:04] first of all thank you uh I'm I'm really
[33:06] glad you appreciate the documentaries
[33:08] they're like a lot of work um but
[33:10] they're so like I mean I was making them
[33:12] for free for a reason because I just
[33:14] love making them and then eventually I
[33:15] was like well I should like try not to
[33:17] sell all my Bitcoin to make these so
[33:19] we'll try and like fund it but yeah it
[33:21] started out um before get based it was
[33:24] just kinetic Finance it was just me and
[33:26] then the I don't want to go over the
[33:28] whole like how I met Adam and how I met
[33:30] issa's story but like long story short I
[33:32] did documentaries with them on like
[33:34] random DMs I just randomly dm' them out
[33:36] of the blue want to join me on a
[33:37] documentary I like your stuff they did
[33:40] all of a sudden I'm like wait we should
[33:42] just like make a company you guys are
[33:43] awesome um and then yeah now we have get
[33:46] based and and um Sor what was your
[33:49] initial question like what have I
[33:50] learned from making them if you watch or
[33:53] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[33:55] I'll guess you already bought some bit
[33:57] coin and now the most important step is
[34:00] to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in

[35:09] completely new for you guys I partnered
[35:12] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[35:16] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[35:19] saw created by anyone look at that
[35:22] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[35:24] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[35:27] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[35:31] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[35:33] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[35:37] make sure to check out the link in the
[35:38] description for those amazing coin
[35:40] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[35:43] amazing I love them so much it was
[35:45] really hard for me to pick the one that
[35:47] I want to have because there are a lot
[35:49] of great options I went with the new
[35:52] transparency Edition they're all limited
[35:55] so grab yours those will not be
[35:58] available for a long time but there will
[35:59] come new models and new amazing designs
[36:02] along the way yeah um I think uh with
[36:06] making videos you have to do a lot of
[36:08] research and I I I learned that with
[36:10] learning something you learn a lot but
[36:12] if you want to teach someone something
[36:14] you have to learn way more yourself in
[36:17] order to actually do that and then also
[36:20] com combining that and a small compact
[36:22] video video I think then you have like a
[36:24] real uh knowledge Bas where you have to
[36:27] have a nice uh package in your head so
[36:30] what are some some key learnings from
[36:32] that I think my key learning is like if
[36:35] you want to survive as
[36:38] a maybe it could be General if you want
[36:40] to survive as a Bitcoin content creator
[36:43] you've got to be just insanely curious
[36:46] about the world and people all the time
[36:49] like you cannot be the type of person
[36:52] who just feels like they know everything
[36:54] I mean there's a couple maybe in Bitcoin
[36:56] but again I don't think they last long
[36:58] term you have to be just curious like
[37:01] yourself and all these other podcasters
[37:03] like you listen to the best podcast in
[37:04] the space and it's just people asking
[37:09] questions they're just curious they just
[37:11] want to learn about the other person on
[37:12] the other end of the microphone or the
[37:13] zoom call or the table um and then when
[37:15] it comes to the filmmakers they just
[37:17] want to jump into a topic just like
[37:20] completely blind and just pick up and
[37:22] absorb like a sponge as much as they
[37:24] possibly can um so you know I've created
[37:27] everything from like biopics of certain
[37:30] people to going to these like
[37:32] communities to see how they use Bitcoin
[37:35] but all that is just deeply rooted in
[37:37] just endless curiosity about like how
[37:40] people have achieved certain things or
[37:42] done certain things with their time and
[37:43] energy and my hope is like as much as
[37:46] possible is to just bring those stories
[37:48] to other people to spark their curiosity
[37:50] like I I was talking to EA the other day
[37:53] one of my least favorite comments
[37:54] honestly when I have people comment on
[37:56] my videos is like great video really
[37:59] well done good cinematography like yeah
[38:01] it's flattering but what I would rather
[38:03] people say in the comment section is
[38:05] like wait how does this work or like
[38:08] this is cool but like how do they handle
[38:10] this in this community or like did this
[38:12] person ever do this you know when I'm
[38:13] doing a biopic like I love it when
[38:15] people leave comments that are just
[38:16] questions like they watch something and
[38:18] they are just curious to like learn more
[38:21] in something that like I didn't cover in
[38:22] the video um so yeah I think really like
[38:26] the biggest takeaway for you know the
[38:28] reason that I like making the videos the
[38:29] reason that anybody should make videos
[38:31] in this space is like if you have a
[38:33] curious itch to scratch making a video
[38:35] about something is not only the best way
[38:37] to teach yourself but to spark that
[38:39] Curiosity in other people as well I also
[38:42] love when when when you get a nice
[38:44] feedback back I got yesterday the
[38:46] comment and laugh so hard because I have
[38:49] like it's it's nice it's awesome when
[38:51] people are like great hose like you
[38:52] crushed it but I love it when people ask
[38:56] questions because that means that they
[38:57] like paid attention and they like want
[39:00] to know more like you you peaked their
[39:02] interest you you tickled their fancy
[39:04] like they're curious about what you're
[39:05] talking about and they just want to
[39:06] engage more that's
[39:08] awesome I had one um comment in in my
[39:12] comment section that left always like
[39:14] such comments like really long in deep
[39:17] I'm like I always put his comment a
[39:19] little off so I can actually um read
[39:22] them in like usually re YouTube replies
[39:25] like quick when I have like 10 minutes I
[39:27] reply to some um because most are quite
[39:30] small and and quick and and stuff like
[39:32] that but there are some there like they
[39:34] write really like almost like articles
[39:36] as a YouTube comment and because like if
[39:38] you have one and a half hours of podcast
[39:40] and it was there was some nice things in
[39:42] there you might do some nice commenting
[39:45] there and there's one guy that kept
[39:48] commenting really nice stuff and at some
[39:50] point I was like hey uh I would really
[39:52] love to chat with you and I even made a
[39:55] podcast then with him I just based on
[39:57] the comments and this was one of the the
[39:59] better performing ones and it it it was
[40:01] so good to to meet him and and we are
[40:04] now almost daily in in in on a telegram
[40:07] chat in contact because he just was a
[40:09] really deep uh thinker and and he took
[40:12] his time with with replying he was he
[40:15] was not just like leaving a quick
[40:17] comment oh hey great Channel and stuff
[40:19] like that I appreciate that because that
[40:20] boosts generally the the the channel
[40:23] extremely just leaving like there are
[40:24] some people that just leave smilees in
[40:26] the comments to to push push the content
[40:31] uh but this deep thinking is like yeah
[40:33] that's that I I get what you're saying
[40:34] like people that actually generally get
[40:38] the the content and and try to
[40:40] contribute more than they even like got
[40:43] from the video that it's that's an
[40:45] amazing thing that people actually do
[40:47] that yeah it's an amazing feeling when
[40:49] you really get people to get engaged
[40:52] with your content and they're not just
[40:53] passive consumers like that is sort of
[40:55] the we're doing the anti is of honestly
[40:58] like the Tik Tok stuff because the Tik
[41:00] Tok stuff it's like you watch it you're
[41:02] like huh swipe huh swipe oh that was
[41:06] weird swipe it's like there's so little
[41:09] to say about some of that content
[41:10] because it's so short and not
[41:11] thought-provoking that when you do put
[41:13] out a long form piece of content to get
[41:15] that that feedback is like wow I'm doing
[41:17] something in the right direction of the
[41:19] values that I want for you know everyone
[41:21] having that long time preference L
[41:23] prence yeah absolutely I had also one uh
[41:26] comment just want to point it out
[41:28] because it was so fun for me I have in
[41:30] the background here somewhere a small
[41:32] black dot and someone was like Hey I
[41:35] would love like here's a link to Amazon
[41:37] can you please uh clean your lens and I
[41:39] was like oh sorry it's not it's not the
[41:40] lens like there's an actual wall behind
[41:42] this I'm think that's like a V like an
[41:46] put in graphic but that's like an actual
[41:48] wall that I could touch uh and there's
[41:50] like just a spot on the wall uh and like
[41:52] people see so nicely uh the video I
[41:56] never saw that spot before and now every
[41:58] time I edit I'm like oh [ __ ] I have to
[42:00] paint the wall now oh no do you
[42:03] rotoscope that black dot out no no no I
[42:06] did not like uh right now I think it's
[42:08] still here somewhere I cannot see it now
[42:10] but it's it's yeah exactly here there
[42:13] like a small small Dot and and the thing
[42:16] is like I never saw it like 200 episodes
[42:19] I never saw it but someone pointed it
[42:21] out like a week ago and now I see it
[42:23] every time I edit the
[42:25] video but yeah kill me uh just a small
[42:30] thing um I'm curious when did your uh
[42:34] Story start with waking up I I call it
[42:36] like let's say waking up you can call it
[42:39] orange pilling or like getting getting
[42:42] unplugged from from the system but when
[42:44] did you start to questioning uh the
[42:48] world I think I've always had like that
[42:51] value set and curiosity that I think
[42:53] like most bitcoiners have I've just had
[42:54] it my whole life um like always just
[42:57] been really creative
[42:59] and I don't know like I I look back
[43:01] really far the first time I ever got
[43:03] interested in politics was when Obama
[43:06] was running for president I was like
[43:07] just starting high school at the time
[43:10] and I was just so interested and
[43:11] captivated by this guy uh who was just
[43:14] so charismatic had this vision for the
[43:16] country even though I'm Canadian like I
[43:18] should have no skin in that game um but
[43:20] it was just cool to see someone who had
[43:22] those like leadership qualities for the
[43:23] first time in my life I I wasn't really
[43:25] like you know used to it with bush and
[43:27] then up here we had Steven Harper
[43:28] whatever right so it was cool to see
[43:30] this politician who had a vision for
[43:32] something and I think that really
[43:33] inspired me and then he won the election
[43:36] and it was like a long shot if you were
[43:38] following him from like the beginning of
[43:40] 2007 he was going up against Hillary
[43:42] Clinton it was like there's no way this
[43:44] random you know uh black senator from
[43:47] Illinois is gonna become president like
[43:49] what a long shot turns out he does and
[43:52] then um he gets in office and he bails
[43:55] out the banks and and uh he crushes
[43:58] protesters at Occupy Wall Street and uh
[44:02] then he goes and bombs Libya and Syria
[44:04] needlessly and it was like it was like a
[44:08] gut punch right I I I even like when
[44:11] Occupy Wall Street was happening they
[44:12] had it not only in New York it was like
[44:13] in a bunch of cities there were just
[44:15] like satellite events and it was about
[44:17] how like why are we bailing out the
[44:19] banks with our money when they took all
[44:20] the risk like it's unfair that we're
[44:22] socializing those losses um Bitcoin
[44:26] existed back then had no idea about it
[44:28] um but I was like aligned to get it as
[44:31] much as possible I even remember
[44:32] watching videos of Peter Schiff
[44:33] interviewing people at Occupy Wall
[44:35] Street and kind of like making fun of
[44:36] them at times but talking about how you
[44:38] know like on a gold standard you
[44:39] wouldn't be able to like infinitely
[44:40] leverage these assets like this and use
[44:42] derivatives and I was like okay cool uh
[44:45] that seems complicated not going to
[44:46] touch that uh 2013 I buy Bitcoin because
[44:50] I had to buy something off the internet
[44:52] um that required Bitcoin to buy didn't
[44:55] think of it as anything beyond beyond
[44:57] that at the time it was just a tool 2016
[45:00] it shows up on my radar again I have
[45:02] some leftover student loans um and uh I
[45:05] was like okay maybe I should invest I'm
[45:07] like you know 18 now everyone has
[45:09] Investments when they graduate college
[45:11] or something I don't know so I uh I
[45:13] bought ethereum and then Bitcoin o sorry
[45:17] about that I bought ethereum and then I
[45:19] bought Bitcoin and then I bought some
[45:20] Canadian marijuana stocks I just looked
[45:22] at them as Investments for years at that
[45:25] point so much so that eventually decided
[45:27] to start doing like um videos for those
[45:30] companies because I was like a filmmaker
[45:31] and I felt like I understood ethereum
[45:33] blockchains and weed and so I started a
[45:36] company with the sole purpose of making
[45:38] promotional videos for the CEOs of those
[45:40] types of companies went down the whole
[45:42] like blockchain is awesome rabbit hole
[45:45] and then the pandemic hit in 2020 I've
[45:47] been holding these assets I was doing
[45:49] pretty well on them for a while went
[45:50] through a cycle there it really wasn't
[45:53] until Michael
[45:54] sailor guy that you interviewed on your
[45:56] show um came out and started really
[46:00] talking sense about what money is it's
[46:03] just like an encapsulation of our energy
[46:05] um talking about it in these more
[46:07] philosophical and metaphorical terms
[46:09] that I started to really understand wait
[46:11] a second all these issues all these like
[46:14] political things I've always thought
[46:15] about and uh been frustrated about in
[46:17] the system I thought were independent
[46:19] and not connected to one another I
[46:21] thought it was just person with view
[46:23] over here disagrees with person with
[46:24] view over here there wasn't something at
[46:26] the root I couldn't figure figure out
[46:27] what was really at the root of it and
[46:29] then Michael sailor in a couple podcasts
[46:31] just made it very clear that it's just
[46:33] money and mon monetary systems that
[46:35] drive incentives and everything and then
[46:38] the Domino started to fall I realized
[46:40] that money is connected to the food that
[46:42] we eat and the food quality and Fiat has
[46:44] a link to Fiat food and Fiat has a link
[46:47] to Wars endless Wars Fiat has a link to
[46:51] um you know family behaviors and birth
[46:54] rates and all these things and I was
[46:57] just whoa you know that was my Matrix
[46:59] moment where I was like holy crap all
[47:01] this stuff is connected to money but
[47:03] it's very deep and saor is a very smart
[47:05] guy how do I play a part in this because
[47:09] I learned all these things and then I
[47:11] was trying to like tell my friends and
[47:12] they were just saying Julian you're just
[47:14] going in circles like you can't like I I
[47:16] I feel your passion but I don't really
[47:17] understand what you're saying and then
[47:19] at that point I was like okay I got to
[47:21] get my stuff together I got to read more
[47:23] books I got to improve my vocabulary and
[47:25] then I will finally start making videos
[47:27] about this stuff and hopefully other
[47:29] people will start to see what I've been
[47:30] seeing so yeah it's really interesting
[47:34] and you also made a small docu as as I
[47:36] mentioned before um about Michael sailor
[47:39] um what did you learn about him that
[47:42] maybe out like I think the average
[47:44] Bitcoin that is listening now to
[47:46] probably on like five to 10 podcasts of
[47:49] his uh I have to feeling but what do
[47:52] some of the bitcoiners maybe not know
[47:54] about Michael sa um that's a really good
[47:56] question
[47:57] I my my biggest takeaway from doing the
[47:59] research into him is that he's always
[48:02] been a very good prognosticator of the
[48:05] future like you can go back and you can
[48:07] see his the last before Bitcoin what he
[48:09] was really um kind of into was um the
[48:13] mobile wave and this idea that like
[48:15] mobile phones would dematerialize
[48:17] everything it would dematerialize like
[48:19] physical books and all these like videos
[48:21] and all this stuff like it would just
[48:23] move to your phone and and these things
[48:24] would be basically free and he wrote a
[48:26] whole book on it and then He piled all
[48:28] his money into apple and he was like
[48:30] 100% right Facebook all these things
[48:32] 100% right on those things and then you
[48:34] go back even further back to when he
[48:36] founded micro strategy in 1994 and his
[48:39] whole thesis on this was that like
[48:41] advertising fundamentally is going to
[48:43] change like everything is going to be
[48:45] about data and data is going to be this
[48:48] gigantic commodity that like everybody
[48:51] is going to have to have some of and so
[48:53] it was like well I'll start a firm that
[48:55] basically helps companies collect every
[48:58] bit of sales data from their inventory
[49:00] to their customer base Etc that was the
[49:02] thesis of micro strategy and um the
[49:05] thing that was really interesting for
[49:06] him is is he was so early to it that uh
[49:10] you know he had a stock when he launched
[49:12] his company I think it was 94 or 95 this
[49:14] was like before Google I think even
[49:16] existed I could be wrong but it was
[49:18] within the same time frame that Google
[49:20] was founded he found in micro strategy
[49:22] right and Google right now is like the
[49:24] prognosticator of all data on all of us
[49:26] that exist this and that's how early he
[49:27] was to this trend his stock went from
[49:30] like a dollar to like 3,000 and it
[49:32] dropped
[49:33] 95% in like a couple days because the
[49:36] SEC went over after his company and so
[49:38] you just see all these little like
[49:40] pieces and you're like yeah this guy was
[49:43] destined to find Bitcoin because he had
[49:44] been through the volatility he had seen
[49:47] where the world was going with with data
[49:49] and with the mobile wave and um he's
[49:52] just always been on on technological
[49:54] Trends and we just needed someone like
[49:57] this in the world of Bitcoin to really
[49:59] start explaining it better to other
[50:01] people I really think and I could be
[50:04] wrong here but I I think that the speed
[50:06] at which Bitcoin has been adopted over
[50:08] the last four years is greatly credited
[50:10] towards him and this is what I mean by
[50:12] like the power of Storytelling Andreas
[50:15] Antonopoulos was probably the best
[50:17] orator You could argue Max Kaiser before
[50:19] Michael sailor but clearly they didn't
[50:22] break Bitcoin out of this bubble where
[50:24] they were being invited onto Fox News
[50:26] CNBC and these big mainstream shows to
[50:29] explain what Bitcoin was Michael sailor
[50:32] was the first person to really do that
[50:34] and it's because of his eloquence and
[50:36] it's because of the way that he his he
[50:38] speaks his Cadence that I think goes
[50:41] really underappreciated like we all
[50:42] think he's just smart for smart sake
[50:44] it's like no he's not only smart he he
[50:47] explains things with these very visual
[50:50] detailed metaphors these connections to
[50:52] energy and fire and wind and all this
[50:54] stuff that might seem like a lot of H to
[50:57] some people but it is like I think the
[50:59] necessary step that Bitcoin needed to
[51:02] start entering the minds of some really
[51:04] important Builders and individuals and
[51:06] other storytellers like me so that we
[51:08] could finally feel empowered to start
[51:11] explaining Bitcoin to people better um I
[51:14] don't like hero warship but he has that
[51:16] really important PL like place I think
[51:18] in Bitcoin history to play that kind of
[51:21] ushered and and started this Firestorm
[51:23] of other people really getting involved
[51:24] in explaining Bitcoin to other people
[51:26] really interesting I just thought about
[51:29] like um we needed like those persons
[51:32] that like explained Bitcoin at different
[51:34] stages like Andreas andos I think he
[51:37] orange build so many uh in in the early
[51:40] days max Kaiser obviously not Michael
[51:42] sailor orange built me uh and that's why
[51:45] it was also the interview quite
[51:46] meaningful to me because the guy that
[51:48] literally orange built me a few years
[51:51] beforehand sorry one one last note on
[51:53] this the other thing that's really
[51:54] important to the whole Michael sailor
[51:56] thing is the conviction that conviction
[51:58] that he's had in all of his ideas it's
[52:00] like not just saying things but also
[52:02] putting his money where his mouth is
[52:04] that is also a really integral component
[52:06] to being able to convince all these
[52:07] other people to also go down this Rabbit
[52:10] Hole like seeing him put all basically
[52:12] all his personal wealth all this
[52:13] company's treasur into this and saying
[52:14] I'm not just saying these things like I
[52:16] am putting 20 plus years of savings and
[52:19] 30 plus years of Labor behind this new
[52:22] found vision of what I see sorry and and
[52:25] he has uh I think he uh video was coming
[52:29] out where he said like all his privately
[52:32] acquired Bitcoin I think 17,000 he said
[52:35] it was he held on to them and bought
[52:38] more of them so he probably has like
[52:39] closer to 20,000 I don't know uh Bitcoin
[52:43] at this point uh which is just amazing
[52:47] that like he had such a high conviction
[52:49] put everything in his life that he
[52:52] worked for in this new thing like that's
[52:54] that's a major thing like that's it's a
[52:56] great point that you pointed it out and
[52:59] I think that's like underappreciated
[53:01] like the people are like just ah yeah
[53:02] he's a rich guy who puts some money in
[53:04] Bitcoin no no like he puts his life
[53:06] energy he his life energy into it yeah
[53:10] and that's that's that's
[53:12] something uh major by the way I just
[53:14] because you mentioned it Google is five
[53:17] days older than me it's it's a that's
[53:20] why I know it correctly it's like 4th of
[53:22] September in 1998 uh I don't know when
[53:26] when mic strategy is is is is fer but I
[53:28] I know that Google is like exactly 5
[53:31] days older than me that I I remember
[53:33] that dat quite good um the thing that I
[53:36] had in my mind is like um who will be or
[53:40] what kind of a person will be the next
[53:41] Michael sailor who who brings Bitcoin
[53:43] maybe to even bigger and and and better
[53:47] state does it has to be like a presedent
[53:49] of like America or something like that I
[53:52] I don't think it will be Trump
[53:54] but do you think like what what could be
[53:57] the the next evolution of of uh of of
[54:00] Michael sailor maybe an an e mask Chef
[54:04] basos uh type of guy but Michela is
[54:08] already so high high on that list right
[54:11] it's a really interesting question I I I
[54:14] don't think it can kind of happen again
[54:17] like like there's there's not going to
[54:18] be another
[54:20] person that buys Bitcoin and puts like
[54:24] all of their life energy into it
[54:27] that is unaware of Sailor so all they
[54:30] are if that person comes around is like
[54:32] a derivative of Sailor right and it's
[54:34] just like you're telling me that like
[54:36] Jeff Bezos decides to put all his money
[54:37] in Bitcoin and he like never watched a
[54:39] sailor podcast before we do that no it's
[54:40] like sailor is now part of the key texts
[54:43] of Bitcoin in some way again I don't
[54:45] want to Hero warship but um if we're
[54:48] thinking of like another like
[54:50] centralized figure that could bring
[54:52] Bitcoin to the
[54:54] masses um I think
[54:56] it's going to be an extra linked to
[54:59] politicians now and you can look at
[55:01] Donald Trump although from my
[55:03] observations like I still I've met one
[55:06] person this year that like didn't really
[55:10] know about Bitcoin and then got fully
[55:13] orange pilled within 24 like almost
[55:15] everybody watching your show has
[55:17] probably bought or like kind of studied
[55:20] Bitcoin over the last three years not
[55:22] just starting this year could be wrong
[55:24] um so Donald Trump I don't actually
[55:28] think really understands Bitcoin he just
[55:31] goes where the incentives are he's just
[55:33] you know he's an opportunist I I really
[55:36] don't think he cares also like the guy
[55:39] advocates for government making fed
[55:41] policies all the time so he he doesn't
[55:44] there's no way that that guy deep down
[55:45] to his core really believes that like a
[55:48] decentralized currency without like a
[55:50] central figurehead is is better than
[55:53] like a king making decisions on things
[55:56] um he's just doing it for votes he'll
[55:58] probably get some good votes out of it
[56:00] he's gotten a lot of donations from it
[56:02] um I think RFK Jr gets it um but I I
[56:06] just can't imagine like there will be
[56:08] another significant Michael sailor esque
[56:11] figure uh that is simply well regarded
[56:14] in the Bitcoin Community just for buying
[56:15] and talking about it beyond that I can't
[56:18] really imagine anyone else someone to
[56:21] die it's all of us man it doesn't you
[56:22] don't have there has doesn't have to be
[56:24] like one guy like it's all of us right
[56:26] we're all doing I think that's the
[56:28] that's the main uh takeaway here I think
[56:30] like the uh the the the might that
[56:33] probably is not like this one person uh
[56:35] but there's like many more Michael
[56:37] Sailors out there that will like copy
[56:39] him basically or do his own own things
[56:42] with that and and it will just be more
[56:44] broader thing one guy that I would love
[56:46] to see being more bit like he is I think
[56:50] close to being a bitcoiner uh but he's
[56:53] not yet there but he had Andreas Andreas
[56:56] monopis on like Joe Rogan uh I would
[56:58] love for him to be amazing Bitcoin but
[57:02] maybe that's I also would love to see
[57:04] actually him interviewing marus saor
[57:07] that would be an awesome thing but maybe
[57:09] that's maybe that's just me would be
[57:12] meaningful for me if if he's actually
[57:13] like like he had bitcoiners on and he is
[57:17] um for things that bitcoiners are for
[57:20] like he's like kind of like this bitco
[57:22] of mindset uh but I did not hear him
[57:25] really getting
[57:27] uh this this Bitcoin mentality and like
[57:29] oh yeah Bitcoin is is the thing but
[57:31] maybe that's that maybe that's needs a
[57:33] little bit more time I think like not
[57:36] everyone can be obsessed by Bitcoin too
[57:38] but still like understand and appreciate
[57:40] it like I I did a documentary recently
[57:43] on Jackal Island um with you know Ian
[57:46] Carroll and uh this guy named Peruvian
[57:48] bull really smart guys that have like
[57:52] really dug up and understood the truth
[57:53] about our financial system and other
[57:55] things that we're being lied to
[57:56] both fully understand Bitcoin right like
[58:00] really well but like they're not
[58:02] realigning all of their energy towards
[58:04] like Bitcoin content there's other
[58:06] things that people are interested in
[58:08] that estu I should say bitcoiner values
[58:11] that people want to just pursue as as
[58:13] makers or creators or purveyors I think
[58:15] that's totally fine like we are a
[58:17] different breed of psychopath that all
[58:19] we can talk about as Bitcoin and never
[58:21] get bored of it um but there are tons of
[58:24] people out there that really really
[58:26] really understand it and they're just
[58:28] like yeah I don't need to be the guy or
[58:30] the woman that that makes the videos or
[58:33] the shows or the books about it there's
[58:35] other really great orators I really want
[58:37] to speak about this specific issue and
[58:40] it just happens to not be Bitcoin that's
[58:42] fine on that note it's really
[58:44] interesting that you brought that up
[58:46] because um I was before in stocks and I
[58:49] thought about when I would have a stock
[58:52] uh podcast I would probably only talk
[58:54] about stocks but as I have a Bitcoin
[58:56] podcast I talk about so many different
[58:58] topics I had one I always bring that uh
[59:02] example up because in that podcast we
[59:04] literally did not talk about Bitcoin it
[59:06] was a podcast with Lisa Huff uh the the
[59:09] the mother of of Ella uh and we talked
[59:12] like it was her second round the first
[59:14] round we talked about energy and the
[59:15] second round where he she was on we
[59:18] talked about
[59:19] parenting uh because she made an
[59:21] interesting um presentation at bit block
[59:25] boom I think it's called
[59:26] uh and we talked about parenting one and
[59:29] a half hours or one hour something like
[59:31] that uh and Bitcoin has losted like
[59:34] there was not one comment like oh stick
[59:36] to bitcoin no no we we did not really
[59:38] talk about Bitcoin but Bitcoin is like
[59:41] also other stuff like I think that
[59:43] Bitcoin allows for you to explore other
[59:46] things where you can talk about all the
[59:48] topics that are kind of related to
[59:50] bitcoin because everything is related to
[59:52] money and and the root cause of
[59:54] everything like as we discussed in the
[59:55] beginning is related to to bitcoin and
[59:58] and the broken monitary system but it's
[60:00] uh it's interesting how you can talk on
[60:02] a Bitcoin podcast about parenting and it
[60:04] makes sense for the
[60:06] fewers how do you see that as a as a
[60:08] content creator like do do you stick
[60:10] with um mostly Bitcoin I mean I saw some
[60:13] uh some of the shorts more that we are
[60:15] also touching on other topics but then
[60:17] also relating it to
[60:19] bitcoin I'm so glad you bring that up
[60:21] that's literally the central thesis of
[60:24] get based get based did not come
[60:27] together it's three bitcoiners who
[60:28] started it but it was not to be a
[60:30] Bitcoin Media company that just only
[60:32] talked about Bitcoin the whole idea is
[60:35] that I think there are people that from
[60:37] a value standpoint when you look at me
[60:39] when you look at you that are so similar
[60:41] in the values that we share and cherish
[60:43] and and the future that we want to see
[60:45] they're 85% there and there's just like
[60:48] that 15% is missing is just not actually
[60:50] knowing what Bitcoin is and how it plays
[60:52] into all those values um the purpose of
[60:54] the videos that we make are to reach out
[60:57] to those people who are like 85% aligned
[61:00] with us call them people who live you
[61:02] know offgrid call them people who have
[61:04] been disenfranchised by like the current
[61:06] system in some way during from
[61:07] censorship call them Libertarians
[61:10] there's so there's millions and millions
[61:12] of people who really appreciate looking
[61:15] at the world through this Sovereign lens
[61:16] looking at this world through the lens
[61:19] of like maybe I can do X without the
[61:21] state and uh the point of the videos
[61:24] that we make are to
[61:26] bring those people into the Bitcoin
[61:28] sphere so we might make a video that has
[61:29] nothing to do with Bitcoin but has
[61:31] everything to do with Bitcoin if you
[61:33] know what I mean right like to talking
[61:35] about like the food system talking about
[61:37] how education indoctrinates people and
[61:39] and allows or creates an incentive for
[61:42] the state to become the parent of your
[61:43] own children like these are bitcoiner
[61:46] themes and topics and you can work
[61:48] Bitcoin into the ending of the video and
[61:50] try and orange peill people if you want
[61:52] we don't do it with every video but the
[61:54] point is to start those conversations to
[61:56] let people know that there are people
[61:58] out there who have this unified mission
[62:00] who are hopeful for the future a future
[62:03] where the sovereign individual is
[62:05] awakened and the way that we execute all
[62:08] this is to just try and tell the stories
[62:10] as uniquely as possible having these
[62:12] candid conversations is awesome uh we
[62:15] have a lot of like talking and
[62:16] interviewing in our videos but the other
[62:19] fun ways that people get connected to
[62:20] this stuff is when they see you try
[62:22] something that pushes you outside of
[62:23] your comfort zone to become sovereign um
[62:26] as of the recording of this I I I'm
[62:28] monitoring this tweet sorry um I'm doing
[62:31] a video where I'm G to try and live off
[62:33] of zbgs for 30 days do the world
[62:37] economic Forum bug based diet because
[62:40] this is like a narrative that's been
[62:41] push that they're so good for you um you
[62:45] know and they use much less water and
[62:47] land and all this stuff and you know you
[62:49] can crush them in powders and they have
[62:51] all this the the nutritional facts you
[62:52] need um but rather from going at it as a
[62:56] like let's just make fun of this stupid
[62:58] idea let's like torture myself for 30
[63:00] days I'm going to make a genuine effort
[63:03] to to get into the best shape of my life
[63:05] to to sleep as much as humanly possible
[63:08] and to eat as many bugs as I need to be
[63:11] healthy in 30 days to see if this is a
[63:14] real thing that we can all move towards
[63:16] or not um but that type of content it's
[63:19] like again nothing to do with Bitcoin
[63:22] but everything to do with Bitcoin at the
[63:23] same time right and I love that because
[63:27] when we rally around bitcoiners and they
[63:30] already know the Bitcoin not like
[63:32] there's two things in like getting
[63:33] people that are not in Bitcoin but align
[63:35] with our values getting into bit them
[63:37] getting them into Bitcoin but also uh
[63:40] having being like being in Bitcoin
[63:43] having that Bitcoin a mindset but maybe
[63:45] not being aware of some other things
[63:47] that still line with our value maybe
[63:50] diet and stuff like that or exercising
[63:52] or there's so many other topics that
[63:54] Bitcoin I love to talk about but not
[63:56] every Bitcoin is is aware of that so I I
[63:59] love to just bring those topics up and I
[64:01] think you're doing also a great job on
[64:03] that note I actually have uh one of my
[64:06] last questions you create amazing videos
[64:08] you do amazing um content with your
[64:11] other partners um what is some of like
[64:15] um maybe an a question more for for me
[64:18] as a content creator what are some the
[64:20] learnings from creating contents how do
[64:22] you make content uh how do you see
[64:24] making content that people want to watch
[64:26] actually like to watch especially like
[64:29] short form or long form however however
[64:31] you want to take it well I wish I could
[64:34] tell you I cracked the code but uh I
[64:37] know that maybe by the time this
[64:38] interview comes out you might be past me
[64:39] in subscribers so my my only advice is
[64:44] people really care about
[64:47] authenticity and you have to like that
[64:49] doesn't mean that you can't you know
[64:50] have fun with fiction and do things that
[64:52] are like surreal or hyper realistic and
[64:54] everything has to be just like a person
[64:55] talking to the camera super candid
[64:57] conversations it just means that like
[64:59] you have to know what you actually like
[65:02] to put out into the world and just hope
[65:04] that one of those things you really love
[65:06] to do is also something that someone
[65:07] else loves to watch um a lot of content
[65:10] creators come from the perspective of
[65:12] like I'm GNA just copy what's been
[65:13] working really well with other people
[65:15] I'm just going to make something
[65:16] derivative and then maybe if I just go
[65:19] viral then I'll just lean into you know
[65:20] whatever people seem to actually like um
[65:23] I think that works but you'll get burnt
[65:26] out because you want to actually enjoy
[65:27] what you're doing and so I'm the type of
[65:29] person that doesn't like schedules I
[65:31] don't like making the same video over
[65:33] and over and over again um I like doing
[65:35] stuff that challenges me that pushes me
[65:38] outside my comfort zone I literally have
[65:40] a shirt that says seek discomfort
[65:42] because of that um and so for me that
[65:46] path has looked like self- torture uh
[65:49] through weird eating it's a path of
[65:51] putting on funny accents it's a path of
[65:54] paying I don't know if you can see this
[65:56] this is a this is a puppet that I that I
[65:59] it looks like Paul Krugman if you if you
[66:01] do a side by side it looks like Paul
[66:03] Krugman it's a puppet that I paid a
[66:04] Bitcoin to make for me for like 170,000
[66:07] SATs might be the worst investment in my
[66:10] life because I wanted to do a funny
[66:12] thing where I talk to a puppet so like
[66:15] I'm the type of person I just love I
[66:17] just love messing around I love messing
[66:19] around with people I love teaching
[66:21] people things but I like having a ton of
[66:23] fun when I do this stuff and so you got
[66:25] find what you love in this space and if
[66:28] you do and if you're authentic about the
[66:29] way that you portray things and if you
[66:31] provide value to people through the
[66:33] stuff that you love you'll eventually
[66:35] blow up the the only other part to this
[66:37] is just consistency so like find
[66:39] something you love doing but you also
[66:41] love doing every single week or every
[66:42] couple days or every two weeks and just
[66:44] stick to a routine challenge yourself
[66:47] you're doing a podcast or an interview
[66:49] every single day some people can't do
[66:51] every single day but find a routine that
[66:53] works for you and push yourself and
[66:55] those moments where you're like ah I'm
[66:57] like out of ideas or I'm out of people
[66:58] to interview like no there's always more
[67:01] surround yourself with the people you
[67:03] need to get those creative juices
[67:05] flowing and uh consume what you can
[67:07] consume you know on Twitter without
[67:09] getting too jaded to keep that like idea
[67:11] train flowing but just have fun with it
[67:14] and uh you know people will come and
[67:17] they will watch you for for just being
[67:20] yourself as weird or as normal or as
[67:23] conversational as you are my thing is I
[67:25] I'm just just a weirdo I'm a total freak
[67:28] and I love making movies uh that make me
[67:30] uncomfortable some of them are serious
[67:33] uh and some of them are really really
[67:35] weird and Goofy but someone's watching
[67:38] them and uh it's what's my what's my
[67:40] favorite quote my favorite quote of
[67:42] recent is like Love Me Or Hate Me you
[67:45] watched that's all you could
[67:48] do take that mentality and just run with
[67:51] it I love that a lot and I think you're
[67:54] very talented in that I for example
[67:56] could not do that at all I I I need a
[67:58] schedule I need a I need a a thing that
[68:01] I can rely on that's why I do the
[68:02] podcast Robin Robin I tried interviewing
[68:05] people like you did and I I've done a
[68:06] couple interviews but I was doing them
[68:09] because I was like well that's what
[68:10] everyone else is doing Bitcoin they're
[68:11] doing these podcasts they get these
[68:12] guests they leverage their popularity
[68:14] off of their guest popularity um and I
[68:16] tried it for a while and I just found
[68:18] that I'm just not a good enough listener
[68:21] to really create these long form
[68:24] podcasts like I listen to what people
[68:26] are saying but then my mind goes
[68:27] somewhere random that's just who I am
[68:29] like I'm just always thinking of random
[68:30] [ __ ] all the time and so I realized like
[68:32] I am not cut out to be a great podcast
[68:35] host but it took me a while to kind of
[68:37] figure that out because I really wanted
[68:38] to do it because everybody else was
[68:40] doing it and so you just got to not feel
[68:42] like you have to be like everyone else
[68:43] do what feels authentic to you you
[68:46] obviously love this otherwise you
[68:47] wouldn't have challenged yourself to do
[68:48] it every single freaking day for what
[68:51] 200 episodes now so find what that is
[68:54] for you you can either be a freak like
[68:55] me with the puppets or you can have nice
[68:57] candid conversations and be super
[68:59] curious about how the world Works
[69:01] through bitcoiners and be Robin but find
[69:03] out what your thing is and you'll crush
[69:06] it I think I never said that on a
[69:08] podcast but I had since I was like 15 16
[69:10] years old always the dream uh uh to have
[69:13] my own Daily Show back then I had it to
[69:16] have it on the television like back then
[69:19] I watched like daily uh evening shows uh
[69:22] like late night shows on a television in
[69:24] Austria like some shows of that and I L
[69:26] like I just binch watched them every day
[69:29] and I was religious like oh stayed up at
[69:31] this time and then watched it like half
[69:32] an hour uh and this this was like the
[69:35] stream like have a Daily Show where
[69:36] people actually show up and and watch me
[69:38] every day uh and so like this this thing
[69:41] actually like follows me L like nine to
[69:43] eight years or almost 10 years now uh
[69:46] and it's it's crazy I I I think I
[69:49] noticed that actually even if when I had
[69:53] it I was like oh [ __ ] what I dream about
[69:55] like eight years ago I right now I have
[69:58] it and I did not even realize it because
[70:00] I I told you my story a little bit
[70:01] before I just started having
[70:03] conversations online and then I started
[70:05] to record them and then I did it like I
[70:09] didn't even not even really challenge me
[70:11] myself to do it every day it just
[70:12] happened to be daily now I stick with it
[70:14] now I'm really religious like now I
[70:16] cannot miss any day even though it's
[70:19] sometimes hard but I cannot miss now
[70:20] like I'm religious with it but it
[70:22] started not like a challenge and it felt
[70:24] always really natural and I think you
[70:26] described it very really good like you
[70:28] have to find something that's good and
[70:29] not something that is supposed to be
[70:32] done like not something like oh yeah I
[70:33] have to do a podcast because I have to
[70:35] do a podcast no you I have to do a
[70:37] podcast if you really want to do a
[70:38] podcast because it's way too hard um in
[70:41] order to keep it up I still don't earn
[70:43] what I earned before with a part-time
[70:46] job now I do it like 70 hours a week so
[70:49] from a financial standpoint it just
[70:51] doesn't make sense right now uh but I
[70:53] love it so much and even if if it never
[70:56] accumulates to anything more than that I
[70:58] love it and even if if I don't make any
[71:00] money and I have to I have to step back
[71:02] and I have to do only once a week or
[71:04] something like that I still will do it
[71:06] maybe less because I have a day job then
[71:08] but I love it so much so I already
[71:11] pledge to that and uh please people keep
[71:13] me accountable but I will do uh some
[71:15] kind of podcast till I die because I
[71:18] love it too much well well you know what
[71:20] I say too is like money chases value if
[71:24] you provide value out to the world you
[71:26] might start be giving it away for free
[71:28] eventually money will find its way to
[71:31] your value creation process in order to
[71:32] sustain it and so like some of us think
[71:36] that all value is like educational value
[71:38] I got to do tutorials I got to do these
[71:40] podcast report learning things but value
[71:42] is also entertaining people making them
[71:44] laugh making them cry making them see
[71:46] the world in a different aspect and
[71:48] these things cost different prices and
[71:50] you have to figure out how to make it
[71:51] work for you um but that's what's kept
[71:53] me going is like yes I had to pay I
[71:56] didn't have a sponsor for years I paid
[71:58] tens of thousands of dollars tons of
[71:59] Bitcoin to make the videos that I did
[72:01] but you have to have the faith that if
[72:02] you like what you do and you know that
[72:04] you're providing value the money will
[72:05] come right you just have to whatever it
[72:08] takes right part-time job side hustle
[72:10] whatever it takes keep it going if you
[72:12] really believe in it the money will
[72:13] always
[72:14] come I think that's a great learning for
[72:16] everyone that wants to start something
[72:18] in Bitcoin or just wants to start
[72:19] something uh in in life in general um
[72:22] which is a perfect segue actually to my
[72:25] last question that is uh now kind of the
[72:28] a new end routine that I ask every
[72:30] bitcoiner what is uh what can we learn
[72:33] from you besides Bitcoin and all the
[72:35] things that we already talked about in
[72:37] the in the
[72:38] podcast what can people learn from me in
[72:41] my life in my my weird life um I think
[72:47] it's just like just be curious about
[72:50] like the world as much as possible and
[72:52] when you have time to sit down and self
[72:55] reflect ask yourself am I being curious
[72:57] enough about the state of the world am I
[72:59] learning things am I asking questions
[73:01] and if you get to a state where you're
[73:03] saying more statements you know at a
[73:05] ratio of like 10 to one than you are
[73:07] asking questions then you should you
[73:09] know take a look at yourself I honestly
[73:11] think that like all the best things in
[73:13] life all the gratifying moments come
[73:16] from asking a question from pushing
[73:18] yourself out out of a comfort zone and
[73:21] um if you do those you'll find happiness
[73:23] and you'll find happiness without having
[73:25] a a giant stack of Satoshi just keep
[73:28] asking questions about how things work
[73:29] don't be afraid of the answers don't be
[73:31] afraid to look stupid there's so many
[73:33] people I know that don't ask questions
[73:34] out in the open because they're afraid
[73:35] of being stupid like I could care less
[73:38] man I really could care less about
[73:40] looking like an idiot online or asking a
[73:42] question to something basic if I have a
[73:44] question about how Bitcoin works I can't
[73:45] Google it I can't find it in a book it
[73:47] goes on Twitter that's totally fine so
[73:50] do with that what you will don't be
[73:52] ashamed of uh being curious about this
[73:54] the the state of the
[73:56] world absolutely I I love that a lot um
[73:59] we have entertain in podcast where the
[74:01] previous guest is asking a question for
[74:02] the next guest without knowing who the
[74:04] next guest actually is and oh I like
[74:06] that that's cool okay it's it's like the
[74:08] it's like the blockchain connecting uh
[74:10] the previous guest with the next one I'm
[74:12] pointing to the next one I love that I I
[74:15] copied that from oh [ __ ] how does he how
[74:18] what's his name Dar for CEO Steven
[74:20] Botley the podcast I love it a lot and I
[74:22] was like it's so suiting also for a
[74:23] Bitcoin podcast and it's a great end
[74:25] routine I tried to F I really tried to
[74:28] like make my own thing out of it and I
[74:29] was like every change I do with that end
[74:32] routine it makes it worse so I just
[74:34] stick with it but yeah the question from
[74:37] the previous guest is uh what do you
[74:39] hate the most that's an interesting
[74:41] question what do you hate the most and
[74:43] love the most about Africa what do I
[74:45] love the most about Africa and hate the
[74:47] most about Africa H the question comes
[74:49] from an
[74:50] African okay um I think the thing I hate
[74:52] the most about Africa is all the those
[74:55] leaders who keep taking IMF loans and
[74:57] and destroying their countries and uh
[74:59] you know letting letting France get away
[75:01] with pillaging like so many countries in
[75:03] Africa you guys got to step up I know
[75:05] some countries are you guys got to step
[75:07] up you got to inform your public you
[75:09] guys got to know that that like so much
[75:11] of Africa is being taken advantage of by
[75:13] France through their monetary system um
[75:15] what do I love the most about Africa
[75:17] I've never been there but I love I love
[75:20] Wildlife I love that there is a spirit
[75:23] of conservation um this will tie into my
[75:26] future question there's a spirit in the
[75:28] people there especially in places like
[75:29] Congo and Kenya that we as humans have a
[75:33] role to play in trying to preserve
[75:35] certain creatures I don't think that
[75:37] it's necessarily right to just let you
[75:39] know the world play out and and let
[75:41] creatures go extinct because that's just
[75:43] like survival the fittest I don't
[75:44] believe in that I think if we can
[75:46] positively keep a species alive um
[75:49] without intervening with you know the
[75:51] natural flow too much we should do that
[75:53] and um yeah I I really love that there's
[75:56] that appreciation in Africa amazing I
[75:59] love that um before I let you go where
[76:02] can people uh ask you questions and
[76:05] where can people find the things that
[76:07] you
[76:08] create uh you can find me on Twitter at
[76:11] kineticore Finance but prefer if you'll
[76:15] watch all my videos on YouTube because
[76:16] that is how we actually monetize these
[76:18] things so you can look up get based TV
[76:21] on YouTube or just get based you'll
[76:22] probably find it in the search bar we
[76:24] make all these documentaries shorts
[76:26] culture commentary there's new things
[76:28] that are going to be coming out all the
[76:29] time I'd like to think that we're doing
[76:31] some of the coolest and most unique um
[76:34] really like different content in Bitcoin
[76:37] and Beyond so really appreciate any
[76:38] follows or subscribes on that do I get
[76:41] to ask a question for the next guest yes
[76:43] you get I usually do it uh offline but
[76:45] you can uh ask it now also if you want
[76:48] okay so my question for the next guest
[76:50] and it ties in with the whole Africa
[76:51] thing is I've been going down this
[76:54] libertarian rabbit whole trying to
[76:55] figure out like minimizing the state at
[76:57] all costs how can we do all the services
[76:59] and stuff we have in society without the
[77:01] state should we give it to the free
[77:02] market how so my question is this do you
[77:06] think that the free market can handle
[77:09] conservationism and Parks and Recreation
[77:12] or do you think that the government has
[77:15] to handle those things
[77:17] interesting yeah I love it I'm really
[77:20] looking forward to to discussing that
[77:22] with the next uh uh podcast guest cool
[77:25] uh thank you for joining us today Julia
[77:28] and thank you for giving us the question
[77:30] and the time uh also thank you for
