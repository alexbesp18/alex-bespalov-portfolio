[00:00] I urge people to be very very cautious
[00:02] of who they believe in I think it is
[00:04] very dangerous and it's very very
[00:06] harmful to tell people in the community
[00:08] sell your Bitcoin based on this power
[00:10] law that would be at this price or this
[00:12] price or maybe this price maybe this
[00:14] price or this price at this time in the
[00:17] future we can't tell you when but maybe
[00:19] you should sell it then I got into
[00:20] Bitcoin around 2012 Bitcoin is the best
[00:23] chance that we have at a fair Financial
[00:27] system if you have a price that can fit
[00:29] within a r range from absolute zero and
[00:31] being so cold that it freezes anything
[00:34] in the universe to the center of our sun
[00:37] does that really tell you anything that
[00:39] would be akin to a weather report saying
[00:43] that if you step outside you'll
[00:45] instantaneously freeze die and shatter
[00:47] or you'll vaporize I'm not saying that
[00:48] we're going to hit 200,000 but I do
[00:50] think that we will have a very a green
[00:52] quarter four in the sense that October
[00:54] November December will be positive
[00:55] months for for the very first time spoke
[00:58] about the power law back in March and
[01:00] and anytime since then I've mentioned
[01:01] the power law I get attacked by Giovani
[01:04] by others if this model is so
[01:07] statistically valid if it is so sound if
[01:10] it is so profound there would not be the
[01:13] need to attack black rock and all the
[01:15] ETFs legitimize Bitcoin now we're
[01:18] experiencing a reality where we have
[01:20] institutional players coming in at size
[01:23] and they're going to have far more
[01:24] impact on the the market as a whole this
[01:27] time we have players in my mind that are
[01:30] actively incentivized to keep the market
[01:33] going up and they're not doing it out of
[01:35] altruism they're doing it because of
[01:36] greed Black Rock gets more fees the
[01:39] higher Bitcoin
[01:40] [Music]
[01:43] goes I'm really looking forward today's
[01:45] topic with the Bitcoin power La as we
[01:47] discussed before uh I had already three
[01:50] people on that were really Pro Power LA
[01:53] and they they love the power law uh and
[01:55] they really promote the power law even
[01:58] um and the other ones
[02:00] I about the power law I talked a lot on
[02:02] my podcast but those three people were
[02:04] basically Stephen Fred and um giavanni
[02:07] to really talked about it h before we
[02:10] get into the power law um because it's
[02:12] also your first podcast appearan As I
[02:15] understood it um why are you passionate
[02:17] about Bitcoin what's your favorite thing
[02:19] about Bitcoin and some how do you see it
[02:22] generally uh um in in this year and and
[02:25] moving
[02:27] forward uh so when it comes to bitcoin I
[02:29] got into Bitcoin around 2012 um I had
[02:32] heard about it before then and uh quite
[02:34] frankly I thought it was a scam when I
[02:36] initially heard about it um I had um I
[02:39] was living in St Paul Minnesota the time
[02:43] and there were a few guys that I knew
[02:45] from college that had moved in a few
[02:47] blocks down I just had to see them
[02:49] randomly and they were um moving in
[02:52] equipment to do a lot of Mining and they
[02:54] were doing a lot of stuff very very
[02:55] early around two at the end of 2011 and
[02:57] I didn't quite understand what they were
[02:59] doing I didn't understand um what it was
[03:02] I didn't understand what um anything
[03:05] about it really entailed and they tried
[03:07] to tell me about it but it didn't grasp
[03:10] at the time right so I missed my
[03:12] opportunity to get in very very early in
[03:14] terms of when you could you know mine
[03:15] Bitcoin on a laptop or anything like
[03:17] that um the first time I really dug into
[03:20] Bitcoin was 2012 um and that's when I
[03:24] really started to understand what it was
[03:27] and at that time I had a very very you
[03:29] know basic understanding of it I knew it
[03:31] was a cryptocurrency I knew it was
[03:33] digital money I understood that it was a
[03:35] peer-to-peer Network I read the white
[03:37] paper very very briefly so I had a
[03:39] general understanding and um then as the
[03:43] years went on and I started seeing um
[03:47] the the adoption slowly start to take up
[03:49] that's when I really dug into it and I
[03:51] started forming what I like to say are
[03:53] my own personal opinions that forms my
[03:56] general ethos around on bitcoin so to
[04:00] give the most direct answer I think that
[04:03] Bitcoin is the best chance that we have
[04:07] at a truly Fe Fair Financial system uh a
[04:11] financial system that would run you know
[04:13] parallel to the traditional one but one
[04:16] that does not um function as a core you
[04:20] know tenant of its of its entire
[04:21] structure that the basis currency that
[04:24] inflates currency away that takes your
[04:27] purchasing power away that essentially
[04:29] means that the more years you work
[04:31] you're working longer hours for money
[04:33] that is worth functionally less and I
[04:36] truly think that that by itself is such
[04:39] a powerful use case that it made me um
[04:42] very very passionate for what is
[04:44] possible with it and I've just been in
[04:45] the space ever since you know and I've
[04:47] ridden the waves and I've learned the
[04:51] lessons and I've sold when I shouldn't
[04:53] have I've um made decisions that I
[04:54] shouldn't know so I've made all the
[04:56] mistakes but um throughout that entire
[04:59] process I've just kind of gone deeper
[05:01] and deeper and deeper into Bitcoin I've
[05:03] gotten into you know the litic curves
[05:05] I've gotten into the hashing algorithm
[05:07] I've gotten into um the Potential Threat
[05:10] of quantum Computing I've I've dug into
[05:13] so many topics on bitcoin that I think
[05:16] it is it was going to do one of two
[05:17] things it was going to make me more
[05:19] passionate or it was going to make me
[05:21] gradually disillusioned and I eventually
[05:23] got out of the space so I kind of um
[05:25] challenged myself to dig into a lot of
[05:28] the topics when when it comes to both
[05:31] economy when it comes to finance when it
[05:33] comes to technology and really make
[05:35] myself a well-versed well-rounded person
[05:37] in the space and when it comes to where
[05:41] I think things can go this year um you
[05:45] know I've been posting for a few months
[05:47] now about the way Bitcoin typically
[05:49] behaves in um election years during
[05:52] election cycles and that the seasonality
[05:54] trends tend to be a little bit more
[05:56] pronounced um in those times and that's
[05:59] just another one of the ways where I've
[06:01] tried to have a more well-rounded view
[06:03] of Bitcoin I'm not a Trader I don't do a
[06:06] lot of technical analysis but I
[06:08] understand the value and um I'm not a
[06:12] person that ascribes to any one pattern
[06:14] any one school of thought but I do
[06:17] understand the value of understanding
[06:18] seasonality I do understand the value of
[06:20] understanding macroeconomic Trends I
[06:22] understand the value of having an
[06:23] understanding of how political um
[06:25] realities can influence Bitcoin and with
[06:28] that said I think this year we have
[06:30] everything kind of coalescing right
[06:32] we've got the Black Rock ETF we've got
[06:35] well not just black rock but we've got
[06:37] all the ETFs right we've got the
[06:38] election we've got the um reality that
[06:42] you know they've had Rising interest
[06:43] rates for a while that eventually
[06:44] stopped and tapered off and tap it off
[06:46] and then rise and now we're getting to
[06:48] the point where you know the rates are
[06:49] going to drop again right 25 basis
[06:52] points 50 basis points whatever what
[06:53] have you I think that all of these
[06:56] factors are coalescing and creating a
[06:58] lot of pressure
[07:00] on bitcoin but I don't think that
[07:02] pressure is necessarily negative I think
[07:04] that pressure is just the reality of
[07:07] Bitcoin evolving as a financial asset so
[07:11] in my mind black rock and all the ETFs
[07:14] legitimize Bitcoin now we're we're
[07:17] experiencing a reality where we have
[07:19] institutional players coming in at size
[07:22] and they're going to have far more
[07:24] impact on the the market as a whole you
[07:26] know we've got um States like Wisconsin
[07:29] and a few other
[07:30] um adding us to the pension fund we've
[07:31] obviously got micro strategy and Michael
[07:33] sailor we've got similar scientific
[07:36] we've got defi Technologies we've got um
[07:38] fold we've got so many things coalescing
[07:42] now oh Michael Dell Dell might even um
[07:45] adopt Bitcoin right that's the that's
[07:47] the big one right so that everyone is
[07:49] just saying oh wow if that happens then
[07:51] the floodgates open so there's so many
[07:53] things that are impacting Bitcoin right
[07:55] now that I think what helps me make
[07:59] sense of it is that when things are very
[08:01] very complex I try to take them and
[08:05] Whittle them down and I create what I
[08:07] call a decision pair and that forces me
[08:10] to say either or so it is either Bitcoin
[08:12] is going to go up or it's going to go
[08:13] down I think it's going to go up okay
[08:15] fine what are the factors that are going
[08:19] to mitigate that seasonality is
[08:21] definitely a factor I think that we are
[08:23] following the seasonality trend very
[08:24] very tightly this year in this election
[08:27] cycle I do believe that what we are
[08:30] seeing right now in terms of the market
[08:32] selloff first we had the Yen carry trade
[08:34] a few weeks back that caused you know
[08:36] that really deep selloff and now we have
[08:40] the looming rate Cuts I think what we
[08:42] saw um these last two days was the
[08:45] market reacting to the potential for the
[08:47] rate cuts and the market um I think
[08:50] front running the rate cut so what I
[08:52] mean by that is rate Cuts imply cheaper
[08:55] capital for corporations to borrow to
[08:57] buy more assets therefore it is in their
[09:00] interest to sell off and to suppress
[09:04] suppress the price as much as possible
[09:06] so that when the rate Cuts come in and
[09:07] liquidity comes back into the market
[09:09] they can ride that wave back up I'm a
[09:11] firm believer that market makers and
[09:12] institutional players and whatnot
[09:14] definitely influence the market heavily
[09:16] and I think that's what we're seeing
[09:17] now that's really interesting a really
[09:20] good point some questions around that I
[09:22] have um you said in the beginning that
[09:24] uh we building a parallel system with uh
[09:27] not a not a disadvantage of the Fiat
[09:30] system do you see at some point the
[09:32] parallel system Bitcoin replacing the
[09:35] the Fiat system replacing entirely no
[09:39] and I say that for a few reasons
[09:41] for and let's just talk it through let's
[09:43] say Bitcoin does replace the system
[09:45] right let let's talk that through so we
[09:47] have hyperbitcoinization right we have
[09:49] Bitcoin being the base layer for money
[09:51] we have Bitcoin being the the primary
[09:52] medium of exchange and so on and so
[09:54] forth um I don't know if that ever was
[09:58] truly feasible
[10:00] simply because we have a lot of
[10:02] limitations on the base layer that will
[10:03] require a lot of layer two solutions and
[10:05] you know that's where all coins come in
[10:07] and so on and so forth we don't need to
[10:08] get into all of that um I firmly believe
[10:12] and this is just based on um you know
[10:14] some things that Hal finny said um early
[10:16] on in bitcoin's days where he saw a
[10:19] future where you had you know custodians
[10:22] and um person to person like you and me
[10:24] doing Bitcoin transactions would be very
[10:25] very rare I do think that is the most
[10:28] likely model I think Bitcoin is likely
[10:30] to follow a gold
[10:31] 2.0 so you have Bitcoin operating as the
[10:35] base layer of money as the base layer of
[10:37] the currency and we have monies that are
[10:40] issued against that the um difference in
[10:43] the model in in this case where I I
[10:46] don't think Bitcoin will replace
[10:48] necessarily completely as in do away
[10:50] with Fiat currencies is because the Fiat
[10:53] currencies are going to be issued with
[10:54] Bitcoin backing them right and then I do
[10:56] see a future where stable coins are
[10:59] really really key and Central to the
[11:02] global economy and with that said you
[11:05] then have the reality of stable coins
[11:08] being issued e USD and Canadian dollars
[11:10] and Chinese dollars what have you and
[11:13] they can operate on a variety of
[11:14] Technologies I think they'll be faster I
[11:16] think they would be um more ubiquitous
[11:19] in a sense that we will no longer have
[11:21] to wait you know two business days to
[11:24] send large wire transactions from one
[11:26] side of the world to the next I do think
[11:28] that um
[11:29] that will cause a pressure on banks for
[11:33] maintaining their current structure in
[11:35] the sense that if you have instantaneous
[11:38] settlement of money and if you have your
[11:41] your your dollars operating on I don't
[11:44] know a back simy of a blockchain in the
[11:46] sense that you understand what the the
[11:49] out outputs and inputs are at all times
[11:51] it then becomes very very hard to charge
[11:53] things like overdraft fees and it
[11:55] becomes very very hard to charge um you
[11:57] know the traditional fee structure that
[11:58] we see in in banking now so I think it's
[12:01] going to cause a lot of fundamental
[12:03] changes and ironically enough I I
[12:06] believe that um the reality of Bitcoin
[12:10] is that in in a gold 2.0 model it
[12:15] ironically creates a more perfect Fiat
[12:19] system in the sense that if it's gold
[12:21] 2.0 and you have this completely
[12:24] pristine immutable traceable asset as
[12:28] the base layer
[12:30] having Fiat currencies issued off of
[12:32] that I think they inherit some of those
[12:34] qualities not not being pristin but they
[12:37] inherit the stability that Bitcoin
[12:39] brings and I think it will create a
[12:41] financial system that's far more stable
[12:43] that's an interesting Fon um it's also
[12:46] interesting for me because like one
[12:48] thing is for sure and nobody will
[12:50] disagree with that you will never be
[12:52] able to buy on the base layer of Bitcoin
[12:55] something uh for for everyday things
[12:58] like of course you can buy something
[13:00] with it uh but you can even now do
[13:02] something even now I for example sell my
[13:05] sponsorships on baser bitcoin like I
[13:08] accept directly in Bitcoin payments but
[13:10] that's because the fees are not crazy uh
[13:13] and and it's possible so but if we're
[13:17] talking about a scenario where everyone
[13:19] is on Bitcoin in this hyper Bitcoin
[13:21] world that's just not possible because
[13:23] the base layer has has limitations so if
[13:27] we even come there uh we need Layer Two
[13:30] Solutions we need maybe on Layer Two
[13:32] Solutions even other layers maybe we
[13:34] need layer two solutions that work
[13:36] together with other Layer Two Solutions
[13:37] like there's a lot of technicalities
[13:39] involved and then the question becomes
[13:42] is that already
[13:44] feared if is a layer two or layer three
[13:48] um already uh to a certain extent um
[13:52] like how how much because the the more
[13:55] you go up with layers the the less
[13:57] security obviously you have and the more
[14:00] are the chances of maybe someone gives
[14:03] you one Bitcoin even though he only has
[14:06] half a Bitcoin so like uh the more you
[14:08] go up it the the higher the chances of
[14:10] that is so it's interesting to to think
[14:13] about how a future system could work uh
[14:17] when maybe we need a layer three and the
[14:19] layer three uh is a little bit like a
[14:22] banking Bitcoin uh where you have to
[14:25] trust a third party but you always have
[14:28] the the the possibility to go down so
[14:31] Bitcoin kind of creates this exit wealth
[14:33] for Fiat like maybe we have a new Fiat
[14:36] system but there's always this exit
[14:38] valve is is is that how you how you see
[14:40] it all with stable coins on on on
[14:42] bitcoin or did
[14:44] I so and let's let's talk through some
[14:47] more specifics here so one of the
[14:48] reasons why I don't see
[14:51] Bitcoin um taking over and becoming the
[14:54] the primary unit of currency for the
[14:56] issues that you mentioned yes speed
[14:59] transferability all of those are very
[15:00] very real limitations here's another
[15:02] limitation that I think or another
[15:04] reality perhaps that people have not
[15:07] given enough thoughts no Sovereign
[15:09] Nation is going to give over their
[15:12] currency to a decentralized
[15:14] blockchain what what incentive would
[15:16] they have to do that you have an you
[15:18] would have an entire nation saying that
[15:21] our money is now dependent upon hash rat
[15:25] it is now dependent upon Bitcoin miners
[15:27] it is now dependent upon all of these
[15:28] exter
[15:29] factors that makes sense at the
[15:32] individual level I don't know if that
[15:34] makes sense at the nation state level I
[15:37] think at the nation state level it makes
[15:39] more sense to have Bitcoin as a pristine
[15:42] Reserve asset that they can use to
[15:45] butress their own system that that is
[15:47] one of the distinct um factors I think
[15:51] that needs more thought so with that
[15:53] said if you have a fiat currency and you
[15:57] have a stable coin stable coins are
[15:59] issued as fax and lead to Fiat right $1
[16:02] for one um usdc okay so with that said
[16:07] in my mind the Fiat system and the
[16:10] stable coin system would operate in
[16:13] tandem with that Bitcoin system so in
[16:16] the sense that if you have a bank and
[16:18] let's say they have2 billion do in
[16:21] Bitcoin they would have2 billion doll in
[16:25] stablecoin right they would have a match
[16:29] a one for one match with regards to the
[16:32] um Bitcoin that they have on the on the
[16:34] balance sheet and the Bitcoin and and
[16:36] the stable coin that they can issue so
[16:38] before that can happen obviously Bitcoin
[16:40] has to stabilized more we can't have the
[16:42] volatility that we see now so this is
[16:43] still a ways off in the future but at a
[16:46] very very high conceptual level because
[16:48] this is not going into the details if we
[16:50] have a system where you have custodians
[16:54] if you have nation states issuing stable
[16:57] coins against their Bitcoin that is what
[16:59] I mean by a parallel system I I think
[17:02] that we would slowly but surely move
[17:06] away from Fiat being issued in the in
[17:09] the traditional sense where you can
[17:10] debase it you can um have fractional
[17:13] reserves against it so on and so forth I
[17:15] do think that Bitcoin can create thetis
[17:18] to creat can create the directive to
[17:21] have a more pristine well structured
[17:26] auditable Fair extensible in the sense
[17:30] that it will be faster it'll be more
[17:31] efficient Financial system but we need
[17:34] to have a parallel to do that first we
[17:37] cannot move from one to the other
[17:39] without having both and I think that we
[17:41] can we can slowly move to bitcoin being
[17:45] that base layer and then having stable
[17:46] coins issued against it and in my mind
[17:49] that's not a Fiat relationship in my
[17:51] mind that is simply them saying we have
[17:53] our denominated money we understand what
[17:56] the exchange rates are we are now saying
[17:59] that we have a stable coin issued
[18:00] against that and then we are backing
[18:03] that stable coin per in um tandem with
[18:06] Bitcoin having that having that backing
[18:08] for the stable coin and we'll slowly but
[18:10] surely move away from having the fiat
[18:13] currency that's backed by nothing so
[18:15] this backing is still variable or would
[18:17] you like say like they they make it one
[18:19] to one or something like
[18:20] that it can depend really this is
[18:24] something that I'm still trying to
[18:25] figure out on my on my own that I'm
[18:26] still trying to say what makes the most
[18:28] sense
[18:29] but if we use um the us as an example
[18:32] and let's say right now you know Senator
[18:35] Lumis is is successful and we start you
[18:38] know accumulating a lot of Bitcoin and
[18:40] having a treasury right how does that
[18:42] work it are we now saying that okay the
[18:46] US dollar is backed by Bitcoin okay but
[18:49] in what in what measure in what extent
[18:51] 5%
[18:53] 1% uh half of a percent you know I I
[18:56] don't think that that works necess neily
[18:59] very very easily however if the United
[19:01] States says we have Bitcoin on our
[19:04] balance sheet it has this denominated
[19:06] dollar value thus we now have the
[19:09] ability to have stable coins issued
[19:13] against Bitcoin a different almost a
[19:16] different currency against Bitcoin that
[19:19] can perhaps you know gain better
[19:21] interest that can perhaps I don't know
[19:24] maybe illb treasury bills there's all
[19:26] kinds of ways that I think Bitcoin can
[19:28] be leverage at nation state level um
[19:31] that will allow it to be on toone backed
[19:34] like you're suggesting that could have
[19:35] backing for treasury bills that have the
[19:37] backing for stable coins there there's
[19:40] many many layers to it I don't know if
[19:41] it's just going to be one to one I think
[19:43] there's going to be many many factors
[19:45] that play into it just because of the
[19:46] way the system works right now I think
[19:48] it'll cause too much um disruption to to
[19:52] try to just mimic what what we have in
[19:54] the Fiat World on bitcoin but if we have
[19:57] stable coins if we have a separate
[19:59] system if we have stable coins we have
[20:00] treasury bills we have etc etc etc etc
[20:02] etc backed by Bitcoin I that's what I
[20:05] mean by the parallel system and in time
[20:08] I think that parallel system will take
[20:11] over but even even when it takes over
[20:14] we're still going to have a um ftiz of
[20:18] some of the aspects in the sense that we
[20:19] are issuing stable coin backed by
[20:22] Bitcoin just as dollars were issued
[20:25] backed by um backed by gold right so
[20:29] that aspect of issuing notes on it I
[20:32] think is still the only factor that
[20:33] exists but we're not going to have Fiat
[20:36] in the sense that this will be backed by
[20:37] nothing we'll issue the do we will issue
[20:39] the stable coin the fiiz of of it in the
[20:42] sense of issuing notes will persist we
[20:44] might have leverage lending we might
[20:48] have some banks that do have a
[20:50] fractional Reserve we might have certain
[20:53] aspects of the Fiat system that persist
[20:56] but I think it'll still be a more stable
[21:00] system I definitely see also the
[21:02] transition period being exactly like you
[21:04] described it like we we cannot switch
[21:07] like I I don't think and that actually
[21:10] hope that that's not the case I I I
[21:12] truly hope that we have for a long
[21:14] period of time like a hybrid system
[21:17] where Bitcoin is gaining on on dominance
[21:20] and and feat is slowly slowly decreasing
[21:22] on dominance because right now it's like
[21:24] 99% Fe than like 0.1 b% Bitcoin like
[21:28] Bitcoin we we should not kid ourselves
[21:29] Bitcoin is still a very small player in
[21:33] the
[21:34] global yeah so um some sometimes I feel
[21:38] like people describe Bitcoin bigger as
[21:42] Bitcoin as bigger as it's all as it
[21:44] actually is um the only thing like if I
[21:47] talk if I think really longterm out and
[21:50] I think like Bitcoin is so obvious where
[21:53] you can pay in stores with it like I
[21:56] mean there are already some stores that
[21:57] accept Bitcoin Co it's not really F
[22:00] stretched but even in Vienna in my city
[22:02] for example I go to a local Meetup there
[22:04] you can B with lightning even you get
[22:06] even a 10% discount if you pay with
[22:08] lightning uh then there's Lugano
[22:10] obviously where you can basically pay
[22:13] almost everything in the city in
[22:14] Switzerland where everything in Bitcoin
[22:17] already so like that that that kind of
[22:19] surprises me that those places already
[22:21] exist even though it's very small and
[22:24] limited um but if we come to that place
[22:26] where Bitcoin is almost everywhere
[22:28] accepted uh and it's technically
[22:30] possible to hold Bitcoin on layer two
[22:32] layer three whatever uh Innovation that
[22:36] I think is not there yet but maybe it
[22:38] will be there I have a hard time uh
[22:41] understanding why people should hold
[22:44] something that and and basically an IOU
[22:47] on on bitcoin where the government says
[22:49] like oh we are backing Bitcoin because
[22:51] the thing with gold gold was like hard
[22:53] to carry and you had to it's hard to
[22:56] devise but Bitcoin is not all those
[22:58] things like Bitcoin you can divide
[23:00] Bitcoin uh as much as you want this
[23:03] digital uh you can carry it around you
[23:05] can even carry it in your head so in a
[23:07] in a very late stage and we are talking
[23:10] like probably hundreds of years out so
[23:12] like that's that's something that I
[23:14] probably don't uh see maybe it happens
[23:17] faster the timing is always really hard
[23:19] for me uh but then I have a hard time
[23:21] believing that an IOU on bitcoin
[23:24] basically where like a stable coin is
[23:26] issued one to one to bitcoin is
[23:28] something that people will hold because
[23:30] they're like yeah why should I not hold
[23:32] the direct Bitcoin
[23:34] but people still hold IUS most of the
[23:38] times people hold Bitcoin on Exchange
[23:40] that's an IOU that's not Bitcoin so so
[23:43] yeah exchange yeah yeah so that that's
[23:46] kind of the the counter to my own
[23:47] argument where I'm like yeah most people
[23:49] hold their Bitcoin on Exchange most
[23:51] people hold on ETF like only a small
[23:54] portion of people hold actually their
[23:55] their own Bitcoin but sorry if I'm a
[23:57] small rent like just wanted to get
[24:00] that no that's actually very very
[24:03] perfect here's why so let's use that
[24:07] example you just brought up right so and
[24:09] let's think about it from a few
[24:10] different ways on the gold standard
[24:13] every dollar that was issued was
[24:15] essentially you saying that this is a
[24:17] proportionate value of gold right so in
[24:20] a way it's an IOU but it was as good as
[24:22] gold you can go at certain at certain
[24:24] points in history you can go and
[24:26] exchange your dollars for gold right
[24:28] okay so now let's think of it in terms
[24:31] of um Bitcoin how would that look if a
[24:34] bank country what have you has Bitcoin
[24:37] on their balance sheet can I then say me
[24:41] as an individual citizen I have $100 in
[24:44] whatever stable coin that is backed by
[24:47] um Bitcoin and I go into a bank and say
[24:50] I want you to give me the equal
[24:53] proportion of Bitcoin and send it to my
[24:56] cold wallet I don't know will there be
[24:59] banks that perhaps want to cater to that
[25:01] model perhaps but this is where um I all
[25:06] of those you know political realities
[25:08] that I mentioned about nation states
[25:10] come into play if you take a look at um
[25:13] custodia bank for instance with um
[25:15] Caitlyn Mong she's tried to have 100%
[25:17] reserved bank right but she is facing
[25:19] all sorts of regulatory challenges with
[25:21] that now intuitively that doesn't make
[25:24] sense why would you want to prevent a
[25:28] fully backed Bank from existing what
[25:31] what Potential Threat does that pose
[25:34] right and that will take us on a whole
[25:35] other rabbit hole but we have a reality
[25:39] where there is a system that exists on
[25:41] fractural reserve that will have
[25:46] issues adopting to and accepting a
[25:51] reality where there's a pristine asset
[25:53] at the base layer that cannot be debased
[25:56] away and that in theory if you were to
[26:00] try to do a fractionalized lending on it
[26:04] you would very very quickly run into
[26:05] problems right so we saw what happened
[26:08] with block Vine with Celsius with three
[26:10] hours Capital all of those players were
[26:13] were doing those traditional Fiat games
[26:16] on bitcoin they were playing games of
[26:17] Bitcoin that they didn't have and once
[26:19] someone became insolvent very quickly
[26:22] everything went up right and this is
[26:26] where um I'm still trying to refine my
[26:30] thought process on how I think it can go
[26:32] because in your example it isn't is the
[26:36] stable coin IOU or is the stable coin
[26:39] truly this $100 of usdc is worth $100 of
[26:43] Bitcoin at whatever exchange rate there
[26:45] is that I think is a very very important
[26:48] question if if we are operating on a
[26:51] true in my mind in my opinion gold
[26:54] standard 2.0 if I have $1,000 in a
[26:57] stable coin go to the bank or go online
[27:00] and say I'm I'm exchanging this stable
[27:04] coin for the equal value of Bitcoin
[27:06] right if it is a and this is what I
[27:09] meant by a slight thez of the model I do
[27:14] see where we can have a
[27:17] system and again this is going to be a
[27:19] transition right I think Nations will
[27:21] transition to a more prene system but
[27:23] initially we would have a system where
[27:25] you do have IUS where you do have a a
[27:29] situation where you have Bitcoin on the
[27:32] balance sheet and the bank whomever is
[27:36] saying that this pristine asset is
[27:38] helping us butress our our reserves and
[27:42] we are now issuing money based on our
[27:44] total reserves what if they have Bitcoin
[27:46] what if they have gold padium other
[27:48] purchas metals what if they have
[27:50] treasury bonds what if they have a
[27:52] blended asset base and they're issuing
[27:55] stable coins to that right for the speed
[27:58] and the ubiquity of stable coins um what
[28:01] what if they have a model where they are
[28:04] like a custodia bank where they are 100%
[28:06] um back by Bitcoin whatever Bitcoin they
[28:09] have on their balance sheet that is how
[28:10] much Bitcoin that they have to um
[28:12] operate off of how does that look but
[28:16] you know there's so many things that I
[28:18] think that still need to be figured out
[28:20] and I think we are so very very early
[28:22] because as you just mentioned Bitcoin is
[28:23] still very a very very small player and
[28:25] I think people really don't understand
[28:28] just how small if you take the global
[28:30] market in terms of cash
[28:33] derivatives um so on and so forth we're
[28:36] in the quadrillions of
[28:38] dollars Bitcoin is nowhere near um the
[28:42] size to appreciably Dent that market
[28:46] just yet right we've got so far yet to
[28:48] go and I do think that um we will get
[28:51] there through a variety of means and
[28:54] because of that because the the Fiat
[28:57] system is so I don't want to use the
[28:58] word entangled but it really really is
[29:02] you know you have $1 being used a
[29:04] variety of
[29:05] ways the the the system just isn't ready
[29:08] for a Bitcoin standard right we're
[29:10] nowhere near ready for it and as we
[29:12] slowly move towards it I this is why I
[29:15] think we're going to have to have a
[29:17] compromise in our expectations as
[29:19] bitcoiners where we can't expect them to
[29:22] like flip a switch and just go from you
[29:24] know 0er to 100 in the span of 10 years
[29:27] there's going to need to be transition
[29:28] period And in that transition period
[29:30] there are going to be things that some
[29:31] people like like IUS and some people
[29:35] don't like like um the fact that that
[29:38] IOU is a fractional reserved version of
[29:41] Bitcoin um or that your EF perhaps is a
[29:48] is that's an IOU as well right we I
[29:51] don't own the ETF my father
[29:53] does right but my father's also 80 years
[29:56] old and he doesn't quite grab grasp you
[29:58] know wallets and Seed phrases and so on
[30:02] and so on and so forth so there's going
[30:05] to have to be
[30:06] compromise that's so interesting really
[30:08] really cool um the second question that
[30:11] I had from from your first first uh
[30:14] question answered uh was around the
[30:17] seasonality of Bitcoin right now so like
[30:19] let's let's go back to the work where
[30:22] Bitcoin is right now and then then do
[30:24] the power law um for me it's really
[30:27] interesting ing what this year happened
[30:29] for the first time ever we have Bitcoin
[30:31] ETFs in the US in other countries we
[30:34] already had it for the first time ever
[30:35] we uh we broke the alltime high before
[30:37] the
[30:38] Haring uh and uh it seems like we have
[30:44] all the buckets that there should be
[30:47] like we have the bitf bucket we have
[30:50] nation states with Al Salvador even
[30:52] though it's a small nation state but we
[30:54] have a nation state we have obviously
[30:56] publicly traded company with micr
[30:57] strategy
[30:58] and I think now like 100 other publicly
[31:01] traded company that is doing that maybe
[31:03] even hundreds I don't know of the exact
[31:05] number how many publicly traded
[31:07] companies with all the mining stocks and
[31:09] all that in Bitcoin already um so it
[31:12] feels like we have all the the buckets
[31:16] and all the the things that we need for
[31:18] a mass adoption uh there we late the
[31:21] ground workor now my question is like
[31:25] will that cycle will that Sease of
[31:28] Bitcoin because of all the reason that I
[31:30] just laid out maybe also because of
[31:32] election maybe we get a trump
[31:33] Administration with RFK in there uh with
[31:37] with Lumis in there that's saying like
[31:38] oh we have to buy Bitcoin um if if
[31:41] everything plays out really positively
[31:44] do you think we can go into like a
[31:46] 10year Gold Rush era for for Bitcoin uh
[31:50] do you do you see some some possibility
[31:52] uh around that yeah I do so let's let's
[31:56] think it through so with regards to um
[31:58] seasonality the at a very very high
[32:00] level seasonality is just simply saying
[32:02] that assets stocks what have you follow
[32:06] a certain Trend at certain months at
[32:07] certain times of the year um and the
[32:10] trend has held up throughout um the
[32:12] seasons and throughout history and then
[32:15] they give you statistics based on that
[32:17] right so if we think about in terms of
[32:19] first the seasonality um aspect the
[32:23] general Trend um and I'm sure people
[32:26] have heard this before like in the
[32:27] markets you know sell in May and go away
[32:29] right that that's a play on seasonality
[32:32] in a sense that you're saying that in
[32:33] May tithy is the best time to sell
[32:36] because summer months are kind of when
[32:38] it comes to price action and then that
[32:40] kicks up against in the fall right and
[32:42] if we look at this past summer we had
[32:45] June that was so so we had July that was
[32:48] good it was a very green month now we're
[32:50] in August and we were in August sorry
[32:54] and now we're in September right August
[32:56] and September typically are very very
[32:58] down months now the the trend um broke
[33:02] somewhat last year in the sense that
[33:04] September was a green month but overall
[33:08] the trend is that August and September
[33:10] are lower months right and um like I
[33:13] mentioned if you take a look at
[33:15] seasonality data during election years
[33:17] there is evidence to say that that trend
[33:19] is more pronounced so whatever Trends
[33:21] exist are more pronounced in election
[33:23] years for a wide variety of reasons that
[33:25] are well outside the scope of this
[33:27] conversation
[33:28] so with that
[33:29] said with um some of the points that you
[33:32] are mentioning let's also remember you
[33:35] know we have rate Cuts we have the fact
[33:37] that we had higher rate Cuts we had so
[33:38] many sorry higher rate Cuts we had
[33:41] higher rates and now we're having rate
[33:42] cuts and we have um you know a situation
[33:46] where we had the Yen carry trade we had
[33:51] I hope this doesn't get flaged on
[33:52] YouTube for be saying it we had a you
[33:54] know what with Donald Trump almost
[33:55] happened right that that could have been
[33:58] a tremendous Black Swan event um now we
[34:03] no longer have Joe Biden running for
[34:05] president we now have Camala Harris
[34:07] there have been so many changes this
[34:09] year that if we really sit down and
[34:11] think about it for Bitcoin we have ETFs
[34:14] we had almost you know what with Donald
[34:17] Trump we have one president deciding not
[34:19] to run we have another new potential
[34:21] president that is now running that has a
[34:23] chance to win we have presidential
[34:26] candidates that were talking about
[34:27] putting Bitcoin on the balance sheets
[34:30] talking about Bitcoin mining we have of
[34:32] course still microor micro strategy we
[34:34] have this we have similar scientific we
[34:36] have all of these factors going in so
[34:39] how do I think that plays into your
[34:41] question I do think it's possible that
[34:44] we see a prolonged trend for Bitcoin
[34:47] tapering up but I do not think it's
[34:50] going to be as violent as people
[34:52] anticipate and I say that for a few
[34:55] reasons if we have um SE quarter 4 as an
[34:59] example here just very very briefly
[35:00] because I think that quarter four this
[35:02] year is going to be good I'm not saying
[35:03] that we're going to hit 200,000 but I do
[35:05] think that we would have a very a green
[35:07] quarter 4 in the sense that October
[35:09] November December will be positive
[35:12] months let's say Bitcoin goes up
[35:15] to 100,000 right proportionately we're
[35:19] going to need a lot more capital in the
[35:20] market to push it that high right the
[35:23] higher we go the more Capital we need to
[35:25] keep pushing higher now there are
[35:28] multiples that come into play during a
[35:30] bull market that are very very hard to
[35:32] predict so I'm going to put those to the
[35:34] side for now and just talk about it in
[35:37] terms of what is possible versus what is
[35:39] probable it is possible that we have a
[35:42] very green um quarter 4 I think it is
[35:45] also probable I think that we can
[35:49] possibly hit 100,000 before the year is
[35:51] out if I'm being more um I don't want to
[35:54] say realistic or not being bearish if I
[35:58] can be more cautious I would say that
[36:01] 85,000 to 100,000 is a nice range for
[36:05] the end of the year let's say we get
[36:07] there then what happens we have the
[36:10] election coming up in November how does
[36:12] that play in I think a trump wins by and
[36:15] large the expectation is that the
[36:17] markets are going to be very green right
[36:20] because he would
[36:21] likely again assuming that he holds true
[36:24] to what he's been saying be a Bitcoin
[36:27] advocate the White House he would you
[36:30] know likely start um printing money more
[36:33] quickly under the impetus of we have to
[36:35] stimulate the economy right because he I
[36:38] can see a situation where it goes from
[36:40] oh we have too much debt and inflation's
[36:42] too high
[36:44] to oh my God what if hypothetically he
[36:47] says let's print money and buy Bitcoin
[36:49] right is that
[36:51] possible sure is it probable no let's
[36:57] say possible so yes it's possible that
[36:59] it happens it's very very possible that
[37:01] it goes to 150,000 to 200,000 in 20125
[37:06] and then we have another 80% correction
[37:09] right and then we're waiting for the
[37:11] next the next having and the next Bull
[37:12] Run that is all very very possible if
[37:16] Camala Harris wins I think the general
[37:19] sentiment is that the market is unsure
[37:23] I'm not a person that's going to say
[37:25] that because she's a Democrat or because
[37:26] of her political view use the Market's
[37:28] going to assume that's it's going to go
[37:29] a certain way and then just drop right
[37:32] down right I think the markets and the
[37:34] market makers and the players in the
[37:35] market are going to be more um
[37:37] structured in their their response and I
[37:39] think
[37:40] they're trying to feel her out so when
[37:43] she wins do I think it's or not when she
[37:46] wins if she wins do I think that when
[37:48] that happens there will be a likelihood
[37:50] of a market selloff that is possible yes
[37:54] I think is also probable just because
[37:56] the market is is stealing her out but in
[37:59] either case with Trump or Harris
[38:03] longterm my thesis is that Bitcoin is
[38:06] slowly going to taper
[38:08] up we're not going to go from 60,000 to
[38:12] 250 but can we go from 55 to
[38:17] 85 to
[38:19] 100 and then
[38:21] to20 and then kind of stay there for a
[38:24] very very long period of time throughout
[38:25] 2025 I think that that's I think that's
[38:28] more probable than people want to admit
[38:31] simply because once we get to that level
[38:33] it is going to take a lot more Capital
[38:34] to move the
[38:35] market um once that happens we also have
[38:38] a psychological factor in the markets
[38:40] where I think that $100,000 level is a
[38:43] very very strong psychological level
[38:46] when that
[38:47] happens we are just as likely to see it
[38:50] pop up and stay at 120 as we are to see
[38:53] a drop right back down 70 because a lot
[38:56] of longtime holders are thinking oh
[38:58] $100,000 is hit we've hit that Mark it's
[39:01] time for me to sell it's I've made 50 to
[39:05] 1,000x from holding from God knows when
[39:08] right there are so many factors that can
[39:09] come into play but if you look at the
[39:11] Gold ETFs of what happened with gold it
[39:14] it essentially was in a long Bull Run
[39:16] and I do think we're gonna we can see
[39:17] that and I do think there's GNA be EV
[39:19] and flows but in my mind I think it is
[39:22] more likely that we hit
[39:25] 2028 and be
[39:28] hovering around
[39:32] $120,000 and that we've been hovering
[39:34] around $120,000 for a very very long
[39:37] time than it is we crashed all the way
[39:41] down to 30 and then had to build all the
[39:44] way back up
[39:46] and understanding that of course if
[39:48] Black Swan events happened that changes
[39:50] everything because no one knows what
[39:51] going to happen then but assuming things
[39:53] take this trend and we have the
[39:55] institutionalization I think that b coin
[39:57] will become a more stable asset with
[39:59] time interesting um 120,000 in in 2028
[40:04] you
[40:05] said yeah I think that whatever Peak
[40:07] price we hit in this cycle if we do have
[40:10] a correction I do I can see us
[40:12] correcting in into the 100,000 range I
[40:14] really do I think that we can go up to
[40:17] like 120 and then maybe have a peak and
[40:19] then come back down but we'll be ranging
[40:23] around $100,000 for a very very long
[40:25] while I can see that happening oh Al
[40:27] you're saying the the deepest drop in
[40:30] the next cycle uh will then like
[40:34] 120,000 yeah I I I think it's very
[40:37] possible that we no longer see those 80%
[40:39] draw Downs um so it's going to be
[40:41] proportional right so if we if the
[40:43] height is 120 for the very very Peak for
[40:46] this cycle is 120,000 can we drop back
[40:48] down to 70 and stay there for like three
[40:51] years yes if the peak of this cycle is
[40:54] 200,000 or 180,000 can we drop back down
[40:58] to 100 to 120,000 and stay there for a
[41:00] very very very long time yes because
[41:04] again the more you need more money to
[41:06] move the market once you get to these
[41:07] levels and I think that we are reaching
[41:11] a point where there's only going to be
[41:15] so much selling pressure you can
[41:17] constantly put on bitcoin right a lot of
[41:19] that happens from the Futures Market a
[41:21] lot of that happens for a variety of
[41:22] reasons but as more players come in you
[41:25] do have game theory that plays right and
[41:28] as more players come in there's more
[41:29] Bitcoin being taken off the exchanges
[41:31] there's more Bitcoin being taken um
[41:33] directly for miners there there's so
[41:35] many factors that come into Bitcoin
[41:37] becoming more
[41:39] scarce and higher in price than us
[41:43] seeing that drop that just puts us down
[41:46] into the doldrums for for a year and a
[41:48] half to two years so that that that's my
[41:50] thesis I think that we can have more
[41:54] boring price action than we think it's
[41:56] going to go on it'll come down and then
[41:58] it'll just stay there it'll Trend and I
[42:01] think that that will actually piss off
[42:02] more people than we think and it'll get
[42:04] more people um out of the market but
[42:06] I'll also get more people into the
[42:07] market if you watch my podcast already
[42:09] for more than two times you know how
[42:11] extremely passionate I am about self-
[42:14] custody and the first very very very
[42:17] important step to self- custody is
[42:20] always getting yourself a hardware
[42:23] wallet and I have one for you here this
[42:26] is the Bitcoin only Edition from the
[42:28] bitbox my favorite single signature
[42:31] Hardware wallet on the market another
[42:33] really important piece of self- custody
[42:36] if you have a hardware wallet is the
[42:39] backup of the seat phrase and bitbox
[42:41] made the perfect solution to back up
[42:44] your seat phase they made a reusable
[42:47] steel wallet check out that beauty it's
[42:50] durable it extremely heavy if I put it
[42:53] on the desk I seriously fear for my own
[42:56] table it's so so heavy and durable I
[42:59] love it this is where my seed phrase is
[43:02] secure go to bitbox Doss SL robobin to
[43:07] get your bitbox and if you use code
[43:10] Robin you even get 5% off of your
[43:14] complete order and the next step is to
[43:16] really level up your sovereignty as an
[43:19] individual you have to have the most
[43:21] secure self custody setup you have to
[43:24] secure your own devices you have to
[43:27] protect your privacy you have to set up
[43:30] an inheritance plan and depending on
[43:32] where you live you even want to have a
[43:34] plan be a citizenship where you can move
[43:37] in case something goes really really
[43:39] wrong and through all those steps the
[43:41] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[43:44] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[43:47] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[43:50] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[43:53] how you can level up your sovereignty
[43:56] and last but not least I have something
[43:58] completely new for you guys I partnered
[44:01] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[44:05] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[44:08] saw created by anyone look at that
[44:11] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[44:13] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[44:16] perfect subtle elegant way to go out
[44:20] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[44:22] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[44:26] coin Vil just dropped a completely new
[44:29] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[44:32] watch collection you have the date of
[44:35] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[44:38] there and of course also the block
[44:40] height and which EPO we are currently in
[44:44] I love the level of detail they put in
[44:46] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[44:49] check out those amazing coin vilante the
[44:51] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[44:54] love those watches so so much much
[44:57] really interesting uh I want to get one
[45:00] more time a little bit on this 100K
[45:02] trigger point because I think it it will
[45:05] be 100K is such a number which will get
[45:10] everyone talking like that's that's
[45:13] because I think like 100k the next time
[45:15] we will see it is a 1 million but like
[45:18] the the the last time we saw it was
[45:19] probably like 10K and before that was
[45:22] probably like $1 or something like that
[45:25] so like those are like some of my
[45:27] psychology milestones and I think
[45:31] 100K could either as you said like have
[45:34] this effect of like oh long-term hodler
[45:36] selling a little bit off and saying like
[45:38] Okay it's it's I have made a good profit
[45:42] but what I also can see with the 100K uh
[45:46] is a big jump up uh as we saw it a
[45:49] little bit with the 10K where we then
[45:51] really quickly I think we ran up to like
[45:52] 17K or something like that
[45:55] so I think it's unrealistic to think of
[45:58] like if we hit the 100K we maybe run up
[46:01] to like 180k and then fall back down to
[46:04] whatever the the fall back uh down is I
[46:07] think uh after the 17K we fell back down
[46:10] like a lot I think three 3, something
[46:13] like that even uh to a really low level
[46:16] so it's interesting of that level
[46:18] because this is a level where every news
[46:21] Outlet like like the complete mainstream
[46:24] news outlet that never covered Bitcoin
[46:26] they will cover Bitcoin when it hits
[46:28] 100K so I feel like that's that's a
[46:30] major
[46:32] psychology uh uh trigger point um do do
[46:36] you think that could U like you covered
[46:39] first that like it could cover like Drop
[46:41] to like 70k down and something like that
[46:43] do you think it could actually also
[46:45] trigger something the upside as as we
[46:47] had it with the 10 so yeah I think that
[46:50] I think that does line up with what I'm
[46:51] saying relatively with a few differences
[46:55] and let's touch on those so your point
[46:58] absolutely it is a major psychological
[47:00] level I think that once we even with me
[47:04] I've been in the market for so long and
[47:06] I've seen so many gations and I can tell
[47:08] you that if when I see Bitcoin hit
[47:11] $100,000 even I will say to myself holy
[47:14] [ __ ] it finally happened right now
[47:19] granted I have assumed it was going to
[47:21] happen and I I've thought it was going
[47:22] to happen and I've acted as if it would
[47:24] would go would happen which is why I've
[47:25] been which is why accumulate Bitcoin so
[47:27] heavy and this is why I still to this
[47:29] day accumulate Bitcoin but when it
[47:31] happens that is going to be like a oh
[47:33] it's going to be a shock to the market I
[47:34] think right so with that said in your
[47:38] example you you brought up all the all
[47:40] the points I think that are very very
[47:41] valid news Outlet are going to cover it
[47:44] it's going to be it'll be Global News I
[47:47] think I think we would have a likelihood
[47:49] of potential fomo there will be new
[47:51] players that come in to the market at
[47:52] that point that buy that $100,000 level
[47:55] thinking is going to go to 200 200 300
[47:57] you know so on and so forth in that
[48:00] case I can see it still um playing out
[48:04] the way I think because let's say it
[48:07] does follow that we hit
[48:10] 100,000 everyone goes wild we just
[48:13] go and we shoot up to like 150 180
[48:16] something something like that right even
[48:19] in that event where we do that and we
[48:22] sell off I I'm having a hard time
[48:27] with the with the current market being
[48:29] what it is with the ETFs with the
[48:31] potential adoption from nation states
[48:33] with you know all the players in the
[48:34] market I'm having a hard time seeing
[48:37] where we have that violent selloff right
[48:40] because in in like um in the 2020 run
[48:46] when we hit 60 or so in the 2021 and in
[48:50] 21 when we hit 60,000 and then we
[48:52] dropped by back down that was a very
[48:54] precipitous selloff right and then we
[48:55] hit it again and we dropped down again
[48:57] right and then if we go all the way back
[48:59] to 2016 and we go about and 2016 2017 we
[49:03] went from like 1,000 to 3,000 to to
[49:06] 19,000 and then we sold off
[49:09] right what people don't mention I think
[49:13] is the fact that in 2017 we had the
[49:17] Futures launch right around the time
[49:19] Bitcoin hit that all-time high Futures
[49:22] and in my opinion are tools to
[49:24] manipulate the market once the see CME
[49:28] CME Futures launched the price crashed
[49:31] okay let's fast forward to
[49:33] 2021 who was in the market in 2021 Sam
[49:37] bman freed blockfi Celsius 3 hours
[49:41] Capital all of these players that were
[49:44] playing leverage games on bitcoin that
[49:46] created extreme instability in the
[49:49] system and in my mind kept us back we
[49:52] should have crossed 100,000 last run
[49:55] because we had fiscal stimulus we had
[49:58] quantitative easing we had a we had a a
[50:02] um captive audience with covid no one
[50:05] was going out right we had Wall Street
[50:07] bet we had all these different factors
[50:09] going in where people were just looking
[50:11] for something to buy looking for
[50:12] something to do and that's why the price
[50:14] shot up so quickly and why the the
[50:16] returns were so crazy but they were
[50:18] capped off because we had players that
[50:21] were actively betting against the M
[50:23] Market and actively pushing the market
[50:25] down this time we have players in my
[50:29] mind that are actively incentivized to
[50:33] keep the market going up and they're not
[50:36] doing it out of altruism they're doing
[50:37] it because of greed Black Rock gets more
[50:40] fees the higher Bitcoin goes all of
[50:42] these ETF players get more fees the
[50:45] higher Bitcoin goes all of these other
[50:47] players that are buying Bitcoin benefit
[50:49] for Bitcoin staying higher up so and
[50:52] that's why I say even in the event where
[50:54] we have that crazy fomo buy to 18 ,000
[50:57] and we do come back down the violent
[51:01] drop I think becomes less likely because
[51:04] of the kind of players we have in the
[51:07] market we have players that benefit from
[51:09] Bitcoin going higher right and say what
[51:12] you want about traditional Market
[51:14] players say what you want about Black
[51:16] Rock once they got into the fora and
[51:19] once they are now players in the market
[51:23] it it benefits them for Bitcoin to just
[51:25] live and die by number go up so once we
[51:29] go up and we come back down I don't I
[51:31] don't see it happening I do not see us
[51:33] going back down to 30,000 from
[51:35] 180 I see us perhaps going to 880,000
[51:40] and trending along that way or let's try
[51:45] this as an example here's another way of
[51:47] thinking of it I see us using the last
[51:52] all-time high so let's say it's about
[51:54] 70,000 right so from the last cycle to
[51:57] what we saw this cycle before the Happ
[52:00] let's just round it up to 70,000 I can
[52:02] see 70,000 being the
[52:04] floor for the next cycle right and I can
[52:08] see us trending there for a very very
[52:10] very very long time into the next cycle
[52:14] unless there's
[52:16] a global event a war something and when
[52:20] I say A War I mean a true large scale
[52:22] War a true um you know Black Swan
[52:26] economic event I don't see us going down
[52:30] further but even in the case of a war if
[52:33] you look at historically gold and other
[52:35] precious medals and other precious
[52:36] assets did well during
[52:38] wartime so we can see us drop below 70
[52:43] but I then I can see us popping back up
[52:45] I'm and this is not me being optimistic
[52:48] this is just me trying to say what is
[52:49] possible versus what is probable is it
[52:51] is it possible that we slam all the way
[52:53] back down again as usual before yes is
[52:55] it probable I don't think so we have
[52:57] entirely different market dynamics now
[52:59] we have an entirely different set of
[53:00] players um we have an entirely different
[53:03] level of volume that those players can
[53:05] bring to the market so I I just think
[53:07] that the um reality of it is
[53:08] fundamentally different now wow really
[53:11] cool I I can't believe that you have
[53:13] never been on a podcast before because
[53:15] you're doing an amazing job I really
[53:17] really cool thank you I appreciate that
[53:18] thank you thank you for choosing my my
[53:21] podcast as the first one I feel always
[53:23] honored um now let's get into after over
[53:27] 50 minutes into this topic that we
[53:29] wanted to get early in but it was so
[53:30] interesting so I wanted to get your
[53:32] thoughts on that um the Bitcoin power
[53:34] law I had just uh to clarify I had three
[53:38] people already on as you know I had gvan
[53:41] on I had Steve on I had Fred Krueger on
[53:45] H and all those three people were
[53:47] amazing guests they they laid out their
[53:49] cases really really nicely I am not a
[53:51] mathematician like I have no clue about
[53:53] math other than what you learn in in
[53:56] school
[53:57] um so my way of analyzing the Bitcoin
[54:01] power law is is limited to what I'm
[54:05] saying like the only critique I always
[54:08] have to it is like you should not trade
[54:10] based on the Bitcoin power that's like
[54:12] that's what I always try to get get
[54:15] people to to understand like uh every
[54:19] model can be proken to some extent so
[54:22] it's it's like I what happens if you
[54:25] sell off a little bit of your Bitcoin
[54:27] and on the next day Apple decides to put
[54:29] 50% of their treasury in Bitcoin not
[54:32] likely but possible and then you never
[54:35] go back down to your level like there's
[54:38] always that that possibility so like I I
[54:40] would never sell Bitcoin if you're doing
[54:43] a weighted DC maybe it's interesting uh
[54:46] but but I'm not interested in that
[54:48] either so what's your uh thoughts on the
[54:51] Bitcoin power law uh what are some like
[54:54] the good things and the bad things and
[54:55] the ugly things that you
[54:57] see okay so let's see here I'm going to
[55:00] try to be
[55:02] as
[55:04] respectful and
[55:06] as objective as possible when talking
[55:09] about the Bitcoin power law and I say
[55:11] that because every time on Twitter that
[55:13] I've talked about it I have gotten
[55:16] completely
[55:18] attacked completely attacked by certain
[55:21] individuals and I've gotten um my DMs
[55:25] blown up by all kinds of random people
[55:27] on Twitter telling me all kinds of
[55:29] horrible things about how stupid I am
[55:31] right so I'm going to try to do this in
[55:32] a way that um speaks true to my
[55:37] personality and to the way I do things
[55:39] I'm going to try to not talk to you or
[55:42] talk at you but talk with you about the
[55:46] concepts of the power law and we're
[55:48] going to keep things very very
[55:50] conceptual because you said you're not a
[55:51] mathematician but I do not think that
[55:54] you need to be a mathematician to
[55:56] accurately assess the usefulness or the
[55:59] validity of a particular model so here
[56:01] here's why I say that let's look at this
[56:04] concept by concept we have first the the
[56:09] principle of what a power law is a lot
[56:12] of people get caught up in the name
[56:14] power law it is it is not saying it is a
[56:17] law as as as is uh gravity is a law
[56:20] right it's not that's not what it's
[56:21] saying a power law is a mathematical
[56:23] relationship okay that's the way to
[56:25] think of it and that mathematical
[56:27] relationship is on a logarithmic scale
[56:30] and the way to think of a Lo logarithmic
[56:32] scale is if you just
[56:34] say 10 100
[56:37] 1,000 10,000 100,000 a million so on and
[56:41] so on and so forth just think of it in
[56:43] that way follow base 10 so it goes 10 10
[56:45] 10 10 10 10 10 okay so that by the time
[56:48] you get to um logs I think what was L
[56:50] six you're at a million or something
[56:52] like that um with that said
[56:56] what that means is these ranges are very
[57:01] very wide okay now having the wide
[57:06] range is useful in the sense that if you
[57:09] are visualizing data and when I say
[57:12] visualizing you're putting it on a graph
[57:14] right if you have a data set let's say
[57:17] like Bitcoin that has a price that
[57:19] started off at
[57:23] 00009 cents and that has
[57:26] a peak of like you know
[57:29] 73,000 it would allow you when you're
[57:31] looking at historical data to have a
[57:34] very nice line that shows a gradual
[57:37] progression upward right it it does
[57:40] visualize rather beautifully if you take
[57:43] historical data and you put it on a log
[57:46] log scale and you then chart it out you
[57:50] do see a very clear relationship right
[57:53] so that by itself is very attractive
[57:56] human beings are visual creatures right
[57:58] we like to conceptualize things so
[58:00] intuitively when we see this and we put
[58:03] the Bitcoin data on this log log scale
[58:06] or even a log scale and that's time and
[58:08] price or just price and we see this line
[58:12] it is very easy to say this is a very
[58:15] clear relationship that's showing the
[58:16] the number trending upward and yes
[58:18] there's Peaks and there's troughs of
[58:20] course but the general trend is number
[58:22] go up right
[58:24] okay what does that even mean you often
[58:27] hear proponents of the power law talk
[58:29] about orders of magnitude the Bitcoin
[58:32] price has followed a power law within X
[58:36] orders of magnitude 1 2 3 4 5 6 whatever
[58:39] okay to give you an idea of what six
[58:42] orders of magnitude is that is the
[58:45] difference between absolute zero which
[58:48] is the coldest known temperature in the
[58:51] known
[58:52] universe and the core of our sun which
[58:55] is several
[58:57] I forget the exact number but it's like
[58:59] several thousand degrees in temperature
[59:02] right so with that said the first
[59:06] question I'll ask you because remember I
[59:08] said I want this to be a interactive ex
[59:11] um conversation if you have a price that
[59:13] can fit within a range from absolute
[59:16] zero and and being so cold that it
[59:19] freezes anything in the universe to the
[59:22] center of our
[59:24] sun does that really tell you
[59:27] anything
[59:29] no okay and why do you say that because
[59:33] um so like the the range is too big it's
[59:38] it's like saying like oh yeah like
[59:40] tomorrow if if I ask like oh will it
[59:42] rain uh next uh week on a Tuesday uh for
[59:46] me it's like it's like saying yeah it
[59:50] could be really catastrophic it could
[59:52] rain extremely heavily it could be I
[59:55] don't know what the word is for like the
[59:56] the solid things that can rain I'm not a
[59:59] native English speaker but it could pale
[60:01] yeah it could pale it could really
[60:04] heavily rain or it could not rain at all
[60:07] and it could be really sunny day and you
[60:09] don't need to worry so it's it's like um
[60:13] if you want to predict something if you
[60:16] have the the thing of like I want to get
[60:20] to a point where I know what's happening
[60:22] in the
[60:23] future giving such a wide range
[60:26] seems for me as something like oh why do
[60:30] I get a range at all maybe the average
[60:32] saves me something like maybe the the
[60:34] average of something uh is is something
[60:37] that is
[60:39] insightful but the interesting thing is
[60:42] like if you have the two extremes the
[60:44] the the average will be always in the
[60:45] middle and what is the middle of that so
[60:48] that's that's an interesting thought of
[60:50] like uh is what what is the middle of of
[60:53] of the hottest uh point in the Sun and
[60:58] what's the uh cold is like what's the
[61:00] middle of that it's it's a normal sunny
[61:02] day or like what is that so that's why I
[61:04] said it doesn't give me any insight if
[61:07] you give me such a wide range so yes and
[61:10] your example is is perfect but here's a
[61:13] more succinct to the point example that
[61:17] would be akin to a weather report saying
[61:21] that if you step outside you'll
[61:23] instantaneously freeze die and shatter
[61:26] or you'll vaporize so that that is
[61:28] basically what it's saying do you want
[61:30] to instantaneously freeze blow blow to
[61:32] dust and shatter or do you want to burst
[61:34] into flames and be reduced to atoms that
[61:37] that is the range that it's operating
[61:39] off of okay so that's the first problem
[61:41] very very conceptually the ranges are
[61:44] too wide to be even remotely useful they
[61:47] are claiming a predictive
[61:49] model okay tell me what Bitcoin is going
[61:52] to be next week tell me what Bitcoin is
[61:54] going to be a month from now
[61:56] tell me what bit for for give me
[61:59] anything tell me bitco what bitcoin's
[62:01] price is going to be with real reliable
[62:03] certainty within one week one month six
[62:07] months what have you don't give me a
[62:09] Range uh that is cartoonishly wide and
[62:13] tell me Bitcoin is going to fall within
[62:14] this range that's not telling you
[62:17] anything that is not very very useful
[62:19] that is not a very very helpful data
[62:22] point which comes to one of my main
[62:24] criticisms this model is not
[62:29] predictive what it is is descriptive it
[62:33] is describing a historical relationship
[62:36] of bitcoin's price data and I say that
[62:39] because what is the only data that they
[62:42] can use to operate off of it has to be
[62:44] looking in the past we do not know
[62:47] bitcoin's price tomorrow or next week so
[62:49] we have to look into the past for that
[62:51] data right and with that again very very
[62:54] conceptually high level you run into a
[62:57] few Pro potential problems okay so you
[62:59] have you're looking back in time which
[63:03] means that you run into the potential
[63:04] for hindsight bias which means that
[63:07] again human beings are very
[63:10] very visual pattern recognizing machines
[63:14] you have an innate bias to say I am now
[63:18] looking at this data on this logarithmic
[63:19] scale it must mean something and you're
[63:22] looking at data that is historical which
[63:25] means it is autocorrelated in sense that
[63:28] and the way to think of that
[63:30] is one data point is is dependent upon
[63:34] the data point that preceded it so
[63:36] obviously the price of Bitcoin on a
[63:39] Tuesday in
[63:40] 2010 would have impacts in relation to
[63:43] the price of Bitcoin on a Wednesday that
[63:46] following Wednesday in 2010 that's a
[63:48] very very simplified example but I'm
[63:51] just trying to give you an overall
[63:52] conceptual view of it right so
[63:56] why that is a problem and this is one of
[63:58] the battles I've been getting into with
[64:01] regards to the power law on Twitter is
[64:04] that the Bitcoin power law theory that
[64:07] Giovani talks about says that Bitcoin is
[64:10] a physical system it is it is all
[64:13] physics it is all deterministic d da d
[64:15] da da okay
[64:17] fine
[64:19] autocorrelation in a deterministic
[64:22] system in of itself is not a problem
[64:24] here's here's why let's use an example
[64:27] that follows a deterministic
[64:28] relationship and this is one that he
[64:30] uses a falling Stone Okay the reason why
[64:35] the values if you were to plot them out
[64:38] are autocorrelated is because if you
[64:40] hold a stone in your hand and you drop
[64:42] it you have the speed that the stone is
[64:45] dropping the time that it takes to fall
[64:49] and the relationship between the speed
[64:50] and the time that the stone is falling
[64:52] right so it stands to reason that as the
[64:54] Stone Falls in time and space and speed
[64:58] there's going to be a relationship
[65:00] between those values that makes perfect
[65:02] sense and you'll theoretically be able
[65:04] to say that the relationship between the
[65:09] stone and the and the way that it fell
[65:11] is now represented in this in this graph
[65:14] and yes the data is or correlated but
[65:16] this is a deterministic relationship as
[65:19] the Stone Falls is going to be have a
[65:20] position in time it's going to have it's
[65:22] going to have a speed so on and so on
[65:23] and so forth again very very general
[65:26] what I'm trying to put across and I
[65:28] could have even refined that a little
[65:30] bit further but what I'm trying to put
[65:32] across is that is a deterministic
[65:34] relationship okay that is a relationship
[65:37] where you have a set start point you
[65:39] have a set end point and you're mapping
[65:41] the relationship between the two you
[65:43] understand all of the parts in that
[65:46] relationship what is deterministic about
[65:49] Bitcoin remember this is a price Model
[65:52] here okay what is deterministic about
[65:57] Mount
[65:58] gox 3 hours Capital
[66:01] blocky Sam backman freed the China ban
[66:05] on Bitcoin
[66:06] mining bit connect I can go on and on
[66:11] and on what is the terministic in
[66:14] bitcoin's price data that tells you that
[66:17] would have
[66:18] happened how is the Bitcoin power law
[66:21] accounting for this the answer is they
[66:24] aren't so so the argument I keep getting
[66:27] into is that you're treating Bitcoin as
[66:30] a physical system as a deterministic
[66:33] model which is which is causing you to
[66:36] say if we apply OS regression if we
[66:40] apply Durban Watson if we apply all of
[66:43] these different
[66:44] statistical estimators on the data we
[66:47] are accounting for the fact that the
[66:49] data is autocorrelated okay now again
[66:53] I'm trying to keep this very very high
[66:54] level what they're attemp to do is use
[66:57] mathematics and statistics which are
[66:59] valid measures I want to be very very
[67:01] clear here these are valid statistical
[67:04] approaches that they're using on the
[67:06] data my argument is they are operating
[67:10] under false
[67:11] assumptions and they are not properly
[67:15] understanding the underlying mechanisms
[67:17] of what's driving bitcoin's price they
[67:20] cannot tell me to what extent this event
[67:23] or that event impacts Bitcoin price data
[67:27] furthermore the notion that Bitcoin in
[67:29] giovan's case is a physical system
[67:32] doesn't hold up to scrutiny here is why
[67:36] physical systems are systems that
[67:38] operate under the SC under physics right
[67:40] he's saying it's physics so we're
[67:41] thinking about gravity we're thinking
[67:43] about thermodynamics we are thinking
[67:45] about those kinds of relationships
[67:48] Bitcoin is not
[67:51] deterministic because it is human driven
[67:55] we have network activity that is
[67:58] potentially deterministic or can have
[68:00] deterministic type relationships we have
[68:03] wallet addresses right we can say that
[68:06] there's a relationship between the
[68:08] number of wallet addresses and the and
[68:11] bitcoin's price we can say there's a
[68:13] relationship between network activity we
[68:14] can these are all things that can be
[68:16] measured that are physical in nature
[68:19] that are more deterministic in nature
[68:21] theoretically that we can say operate in
[68:25] that f
[68:26] but there's Bitcoin the asset there's
[68:29] Bitcoin the system Bitcoin the system is
[68:34] networks Bitcoin miners hash rate all of
[68:37] that Bitcoin the asset is human driven
[68:40] supplying demand buyers and sellers
[68:42] here's why in all of these aspects here
[68:45] in Bitcoin the system that works right
[68:48] that works very very seamlessly we can
[68:51] even say fine let's throw in the hashing
[68:53] algorithm let's throw in the itic curve
[68:56] that secures Bitcoin let's throw in
[68:57] everything there in Bitcoin the system
[69:01] over here Bitcoin the asset this is the
[69:05] primary driver of Bitcoin in my in my
[69:07] opinion and I say that for one very
[69:09] simple reason and here's where again I'm
[69:11] trying to talk with you not at you as
[69:13] some other individuals might remove
[69:16] humans from the world remove humans from
[69:18] the system all together if there's no
[69:20] one to buy Bitcoin what does the price
[69:23] go up does it go down does it do
[69:24] anything I mean without humans probably
[69:26] Bitcoin doesn't exist so it's an
[69:28] interesting question uh if if Bitcoin
[69:32] now exists and humans uh go extinct uh
[69:36] there's a chance of aliens using it or
[69:38] AI using it or something like that uh
[69:40] but without aliens and without Ai and
[69:43] all those things obviously Bitcoin is
[69:46] there to be money between humans and
[69:49] without humans using it uh there is no
[69:52] market for Bitcoin like there there will
[69:54] be no price for Bitcoin there's no US
[69:56] dollar there's there's nothing else
[69:58] against like there's nobody valuing it
[70:01] at all so like without without the
[70:05] aliens picking it up without AI using it
[70:07] um without other creatures finding it
[70:09] and stuff like that all those things
[70:11] that I think it's very unrealistic to
[70:13] happen um I would say then there's not
[70:16] even a market for Bitcoin so there's
[70:19] obviously also no price and no movement
[70:21] on stuff like that correct Not only
[70:23] would there be if there there are no
[70:25] humans to buy there's no supply and
[70:28] demand there um is no General market
[70:33] sentiment that would drive supply and
[70:35] demand there's no one to use it and it
[70:39] seems like a an extreme example but I
[70:41] have to use it in order to illustrate
[70:42] why the physical system model doesn't
[70:44] make sense take humans out of the system
[70:46] altogether and and I'm just talking
[70:48] about Bitcoin the asset here that
[70:51] there's there's no one to use it there's
[70:52] no one to exchange it there's no one to
[70:54] send it there's no one to receive it
[70:55] that there's no use for it the the
[70:58] system it's is not just going to
[71:00] magically start sending Bitcoin back and
[71:02] forth from wallets um via some form of I
[71:05] don't know physical osmosis or something
[71:07] right it's not going to happen so with
[71:09] that being said if you have Bitcoin the
[71:12] system you have Bitcoin the asset any
[71:14] predictive model must account for
[71:15] Bitcoin the system and Bitcoin the asset
[71:18] what they're attempting to do is saying
[71:19] Bitcoin is a system therefore everything
[71:21] is mathematically determinable and
[71:23] understandable therefore we are are
[71:25] using mathematical and statistical
[71:26] modeling to validate our thesis
[71:29] therefore we are operating under the the
[71:31] understanding and the assumption that if
[71:33] we operate with this statistical
[71:34] estimator and this statistical um
[71:38] evaluation and we do these out of
[71:40] samplings and we do etc etc etc we are
[71:43] accounting for
[71:45] autocorrelation but they are not so
[71:48] coming back to the point of
[71:49] autocorrelation if you do not understand
[71:52] what is driving the Bitcoin price which
[71:55] which they do not because we cannot say
[71:57] for certain we cannot say for certain
[72:00] what is driving the price of anything
[72:02] there are too many factors you cannot
[72:05] account for those if you are not
[72:07] accounting for the fact that Bitcoin is
[72:09] a social human system as well as a
[72:13] physical one not just a physical one if
[72:17] you are not accounting for the reality
[72:19] of potential Black Swan events if you
[72:21] are not accounting for the reality of um
[72:24] potential
[72:26] um positive events as
[72:28] in apple and Dell and Google and meta on
[72:33] the same day all announc we're putting
[72:35] Bitcoin in a balance sheet in a value of
[72:37] 10 billion each the price is going to
[72:40] explode to the upside right so you need
[72:42] to account for the the black swans and
[72:45] you need to account for what I would
[72:46] call a white swan right that would be a
[72:47] white swan event where it is incredibly
[72:50] positive if you cannot account for all
[72:53] of those factors if you cannot
[72:56] realistically and reliably model for all
[72:59] those factors in the data you are not
[73:02] predicting anything what you are doing
[73:05] is you fit a line to historical data you
[73:08] are now projecting that line into the
[73:09] future and you're assuming that that
[73:13] what caused the price action in the past
[73:15] will persist into the
[73:17] future what they're doing is little more
[73:20] than me opening Instagram and scrolling
[73:22] and seeing my sun sign horoscope there's
[73:24] no real rigor to it and what they are
[73:27] attempting to do and I don't even mean
[73:30] to say that to insult astrologers
[73:32] because even astrologers use multiple
[73:33] data points they're using one
[73:37] price maybe two
[73:40] time but time is independent variable
[73:43] time will move regardless of price so we
[73:45] have to take that out out of the
[73:46] equation they're using one single data
[73:51] point looking in the past projecting it
[73:54] into the future
[73:55] and claiming it is predictive even with
[73:58] that said in conversations and arguments
[74:02] with these individuals and I've seen
[74:04] other conversations on Twitter and I've
[74:06] seen and other video interviews that
[74:07] they've
[74:08] done a lot of the proponents of this
[74:10] model have admitted the model will break
[74:13] at some point but they cannot say when
[74:15] the
[74:16] model cannot predict exactly when a
[74:20] price will occur the model is openly
[74:24] they admit based on historical data so
[74:27] we now have a model that is claiming to
[74:30] be predictive and let's just all say it
[74:32] all out so far with what we have they
[74:35] don't account for the human factor they
[74:37] don't account for the social Factor they
[74:39] cannot reliably say to what extent any
[74:41] of those factors impact the data that
[74:43] they're looking at they cannot predict
[74:45] into the future how these things would
[74:46] impact the data that they're looking at
[74:48] they're looking at historical data that
[74:50] is
[74:51] autocorrelated that is inherently biased
[74:55] and they are also admitting that the
[74:58] model will break at some point in the
[74:59] future but the predict the predictive
[75:01] model that is supposed to predict the
[75:03] outcome of Bitcoin within a certain
[75:05] range cannot predict when it would fail
[75:07] so the predictive model can't predict
[75:08] when it would fail and the predictive
[75:09] model can't predict the extent to where
[75:11] these factors impact the price of
[75:13] Bitcoin so again I ask you what is it
[75:15] predicting it's a it's a hell of a good
[75:19] question I I would love to see a debate
[75:22] between you and Jan or something like
[75:24] that would would be an interesting thing
[75:26] if he would stop insulting me and
[75:28] calling me names and um being very very
[75:31] hostile is possible but
[75:35] um
[75:37] what and this is where I would I perhaps
[75:40] would seem biased what what is separ
[75:42] What Separates Me from other individuals
[75:44] in the space and this is something I'm
[75:46] very very proud of I don't have a profit
[75:48] motive I am very very successful in my
[75:53] professional life big coin has made me
[75:56] independently wealthy I do not have the
[76:00] need to sell you a patreon talking about
[76:03] the power law I do not have a need to
[76:05] sell you a patreon talking about against
[76:09] the power law I am not trying to sell
[76:11] you a book I am not trying to sell you a
[76:13] membership I am not trying to tell you
[76:16] follow me and pay me this dollar amount
[76:20] so I can show you when to sell Bitcoin
[76:22] in the future based on the power law I
[76:24] am giving this information out for free
[76:26] my only motive is to tell people to be
[76:29] very very wary of individuals attempting
[76:32] to predict the future and also to be
[76:35] very very wary of individuals that are
[76:37] so blatantly hostile towards anyone that
[76:40] challenges that narrative because I for
[76:44] for the very first time spoke about the
[76:46] power law back in
[76:48] March and anytime since then I've
[76:51] mentioned the power
[76:52] law I get attacked by Giovani by others
[76:56] and the other question I bring up to
[76:58] people is if this model is so
[77:01] statistically valid if it is so sound if
[77:06] it is so
[77:08] profound there would not be the need to
[77:11] attack so I urge people to be very very
[77:14] cautious of who they believe in and I
[77:17] urge people to be very very cautious of
[77:20] what decisions they make based on that
[77:23] decision ALS also I urge people to
[77:26] realize that being an astrophysicist or
[77:28] being a PhD does not mean that you are
[77:31] more intelligent than the population it
[77:33] is a function of time so with that said
[77:37] I'll also bring up this as a nugget the
[77:39] first argument that I had about the
[77:40] power law was that it was a statistical
[77:43] model I was told directly by multiple
[77:46] proponents of this of this theory that
[77:48] it has quote nothing to do with
[77:51] Statistics while all the validation all
[77:55] of the um evidence that they presented
[77:58] for the power law is
[78:00] statistical I say that because I'm
[78:03] urging you and I'm urging others to
[78:05] challenge this
[78:07] narrative the power law is useful it is
[78:11] descriptive it can be a tool in another
[78:16] um model where we have a more holistic
[78:18] view that does take the social aspects
[78:20] of Bitcoin into play but I think it is
[78:22] very dangerous and it's very very
[78:25] harmful to tell people in the community
[78:28] sell your Bitcoin based on this power
[78:31] law that will be at this price or this
[78:33] price or maybe this price maybe this
[78:35] price or this price at this time in the
[78:38] future we can't tell you when but maybe
[78:40] you should sell it then because people
[78:42] are actually going to listen to this and
[78:43] in your example that you gave someone's
[78:45] going to
[78:46] sell and then the next day or the next
[78:49] month or something like that news is
[78:52] going to come out is going to explode to
[78:53] the upside and they're going to miss
[78:54] their chance now granted it is just as
[78:57] likely that it'll explode to the
[78:58] downside as well sure but we should not
[79:01] be trading based on this thing the
[79:03] ranges are too wide to be useful it is
[79:07] not statistically useful it is not
[79:09] beneficial it is descriptive and if you
[79:11] are a person that is using it as another
[79:13] tool in your in Your
[79:15] Arsenal I urge you to do
[79:18] that however there are many people on
[79:20] Twitter and I've seen them I've
[79:22] interacted with them that believe in the
[79:24] validity of the power law that believe
[79:25] it is useful they're not promoting it
[79:28] all they're saying is this is another
[79:30] tool in my Arsenal and I think it is
[79:33] useful and I like it because it informs
[79:35] my decisions long term that I am fine
[79:38] with claims of predictability claims of
[79:41] validity to be a predictive model that
[79:43] is where I have issue really
[79:46] interesting I love it a lot how how you
[79:48] VI it and I think you you're the first
[79:51] one that shows me in an understandable
[79:54] way
[79:55] um what my gut
[79:57] feeling gut feeling told me about the
[80:01] power especially love at one point with
[80:04] uh it's it's only based on one data
[80:06] point I think that's that's the main
[80:09] thing you just like look at the price
[80:10] and then you draw a line in it it's
[80:13] really interesting like I I would I
[80:15] would really love to to see the the a
[80:17] debate or something like that but uh
[80:19] let's let's come to um let's come to one
[80:23] uh to the endro te as we already very uh
[80:26] progressed in the time um maybe we can
[80:29] apologize for that I just I'm talking no
[80:31] no no worries no worries it's it's it's
[80:33] been really great like I think you laid
[80:36] out the power law and a really balanced
[80:39] view to that in an amazing way and uh
[80:43] it's it's it's it's such a bad thing if
[80:46] like I love debates but Mo most of them
[80:50] they they get emotional and and then
[80:52] it's like I I don't like that like if
[80:53] it's it gets emotional or it gets like
[80:55] even harmful to each other that's not
[80:58] what what I I like and most debates for
[81:01] some reason I go in that that direction
[81:04] so I I can understand um perfect then
[81:07] let's get to the end routine where I
[81:09] have two questions the first question is
[81:11] always the same question for everyone
[81:13] what can we learn from you besides all
[81:15] the things that we already talked
[81:18] about oh
[81:20] wow um I would say that I am a person
[81:24] that enjoys learning and as such I like
[81:26] sharing information which is what kind
[81:28] of motivated me to um do this this um
[81:31] podcast I would say that I am a firm
[81:34] believer in the future I do think that
[81:38] we have a bright future ahead of us
[81:39] despite the fact that you know if you
[81:42] look at the political landscape if you
[81:44] look at um different things it can seem
[81:47] daunting but I I am a firm believer that
[81:49] we are heading towards a brighter future
[81:51] um with that said I think that a
[81:55] informed population is a fundamentally
[81:59] more sound population which is why again
[82:02] I'm a a big advocate in sharing
[82:04] information um besides that I think that
[82:09] um I like to think of myself as an
[82:11] approachable person I like to think of
[82:13] myself as a honest person I like to
[82:15] think of myself as a fair person and I
[82:19] take that approach through everything
[82:22] that I do and if there's one thing
[82:25] that I would like um people to know
[82:27] about me if I had to dumb that down to
[82:29] one simple thing is that
[82:33] I pride
[82:35] myself on challenging my assumptions
[82:38] learning adapting and growing my
[82:41] knowledge base I guess that's the best
[82:43] way I can describe myself on based on
[82:45] what I do in Twitter and what based on
[82:47] what I do in my Prof professional life
[82:48] I'm trying to find a way to to like jux
[82:51] suppose them both interesting really
[82:52] cool uh thank you so much uh for that
[82:54] input I love it a lot um we have an end
[82:58] the other end routine where is where the
[83:01] the previous guest is asking a question
[83:02] for the next guest without knowing who
[83:03] the next guest actually is and the
[83:05] question is an interesting one um if we
[83:10] um assume that Bitcoin will win and
[83:12] Bitcoin is is the the dominant thing how
[83:15] do we make sure that we as Bitcoin us
[83:19] win um we as bitcoiners will could win
[83:22] or will win in that in that example by
[83:26] staying true to the ethos of what
[83:27] Bitcoin is now that can
[83:30] be um different based on the bitcoiner
[83:34] some people are very very strong in the
[83:37] gold 2.0 Camp some people are very very
[83:39] strong in the medium of Exchange Camp
[83:40] what have you I bring that up to say
[83:43] that I think bitcoiners win by using our
[83:46] Collective political Capital to
[83:49] implement change so I do think we need
[83:52] to be a more vocal voting block
[83:55] I do think we need to be a more vocal
[83:57] knowledge block kind of like and I'm not
[84:00] trying toot my own horn here but that is
[84:02] why I'm trying to share information as
[84:04] much as possible I think we should try
[84:06] to share information with the public as
[84:07] much as possible I think that um keeping
[84:11] Bitcoin true to his decentralized
[84:15] immutable um nature is key we should
[84:18] actively try to um impede anyone that
[84:21] tries to co-opt it we should make sure
[84:24] that we hold institutional players
[84:26] accountable we should also make sure
[84:30] that just
[84:32] because we've won and we've established
[84:36] Bitcoin as the predominant currency the
[84:38] predominant store value what have you
[84:40] that does not mean the job is done we
[84:43] have to make sure that us winning
[84:46] actually helps the world right so I'm
[84:48] sure you've heard fix the money fix the
[84:51] world if we've won I think that means we
[84:54] fixed F the money right so now that
[84:56] we've fixed the money in this example we
[84:59] have to fix the world and and that is
[85:01] where all these other factors I think
[85:03] come into play it was such a pleasure
[85:04] talking with you Adrian I think um it
[85:07] will definitely not be your last podcast
[85:10] I think you're really interesting and I
[85:12] definitely want to to have you on again
