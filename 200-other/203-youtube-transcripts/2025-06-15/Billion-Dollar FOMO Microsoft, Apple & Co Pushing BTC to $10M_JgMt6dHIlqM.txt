[00:00] if you don't have it you're going to be
[00:01] in a bad situation Bitcoin is going to
[00:03] 10 million if you don't have Bitcoin you
[00:05] are poor 2020 when micro strategy about
[00:09] the the first Bitcoin most if not all of
[00:11] the companies didn't exist you know it
[00:13] was not in their realm of possibility
[00:15] and now it's starting to creep in a
[00:18] little bit Microsoft might buy some we
[00:21] are pushing Bitcoin on the global
[00:24] balance sheet of the world's
[00:26] corporations the existence of Bitcoin
[00:28] prevent them from doing permanent
[00:30] deficits there is no marketing CEO and
[00:33] we have the best marketing ever
[00:36] investing in the stock market is more
[00:38] like a gumb and also it's barely keeping
[00:41] up with inflation there is everything
[00:43] red everything is going down against
[00:46] Bitcoin most of the company in the index
[00:48] were actually burning capitals micro
[00:51] strategy outperformed every single S&P
[00:54] 500 stock since they adopted a Bitcoin
[00:56] standard the Swiss Central Bank bought
[00:59] some strategy uh stocks January 2020
[01:03] average house price in America was 45
[01:06] Bitcoin and now we're down to six
[01:09] [Music]
[01:13] Bitcoin so in France today we are in
[01:17] they're starting to vote the budget in
[01:20] the Parliament and obviously with all of
[01:23] these political talks people are talking
[01:25] about uh making sure that uh everyone
[01:28] have have jobs and work and stuff like
[01:31] that and that made me think about the
[01:33] fact that actually maybe um the the goal
[01:37] the ultimate goal of humanity is not to
[01:39] work uh 24/7 you know but more uh to to
[01:43] have a a freedom to work if you want to
[01:45] work but also have the freedom to do
[01:48] some other things and uh it might be
[01:51] linked to bitcoin and also inflation uh
[01:55] topics so that made me think about that
[01:57] as well really cool let's let's just
[01:59] start with with with that end there it's
[02:01] really cool uh so they are they they're
[02:04] voting for what exactly in France so um
[02:09] so I don't know if you if you heard
[02:11] about that but we had a recent uh
[02:13] election uh in the like in the in the
[02:17] summer to basically elect choose a new
[02:20] government so elect a new Parliament and
[02:23] then after that choose a new government
[02:25] and the government has been chosen uh uh
[02:29] in the beginning of this of September if
[02:31] I if I remember correctly and so now the
[02:33] parliament is uh voting the annual
[02:36] budget for the state and one of the key
[02:39] points of this uh budget one of the key
[02:43] uh uh goal of this budget is to uh
[02:46] reduce the government uh deficits
[02:49] because I think today we are about like
[02:51] 5% of uh GDP something like that and the
[02:54] goal is obviously to bring it down and
[02:57] so there there's there are a lot of
[02:59] talks about that uh and the the thing is
[03:03] that in France in in our new Parliament
[03:07] there is no strong majority so it's like
[03:09] one third basically one third is left
[03:12] one third is more Center and one third
[03:16] is more white leaning party and
[03:20] basically they're all debating uh about
[03:23] the budet obviously they have different
[03:25] ideas for example on the left they want
[03:27] to tax more on the right they tend to
[03:31] want to reduce spending uh which is I
[03:35] mean that's a personal opinion but in
[03:37] France we have a pretty high uh spending
[03:40] I think the government is like
[03:42] government spending is like six 60% of
[03:45] of GDP or something like that I mean the
[03:47] government is quite huge in in
[03:50] France and so there are all these ideas
[03:53] coming up and obviously uh when you talk
[03:57] about Taxation and taxing it kind of
[04:01] become really hairy really really fast
[04:06] and so yeah these are the some kind of
[04:08] of talks that they are talking about and
[04:11] talking about taxation I've seen that
[04:13] also made me think about this like new
[04:16] um uh ECB um report or paper that I've
[04:21] seen uh uh I think they they released it
[04:24] like beginning of the week and basically
[04:26] they are saying in this new paper that
[04:30] uh Bitcoin if it reaches a high enough
[04:35] market cap and and a high price so for
[04:37] example they are talking about 10
[04:39] million euros per Bitcoin in this report
[04:41] uh it will have negative effect on the
[04:45] on
[04:46] the on society and to uh to uh prevent
[04:51] that uh government should uh aim at
[04:55] taxing uh Bitcoin uh uh really heavily
[05:00] uh if not prevent it for from I mean ban
[05:04] it alog together uh and there there has
[05:08] been a similar report from the FED in
[05:12] the US talking about similar things
[05:15] basically they said that the existence
[05:18] of Bitcoin prevent them from doing uh
[05:21] permanent deficits so all of that is
[05:24] kind of linked you know so I don't know
[05:26] if it's like just random or if there are
[05:30] some uh ties between all of that but
[05:33] that that made me I mean I I that made
[05:36] me think a bit about all of that and I
[05:38] found it a bit in a way funny but in a
[05:41] way worrisome also because I feel like
[05:44] we are entering into the then they fight
[05:47] you phase uh trying to uh basically uh
[05:52] fight Bitcoin again uh because for
[05:56] example talking about the the European
[05:58] Central Bank they they have talked
[06:01] multiple time about Bitcoin and
[06:03] published papers and report and whatnot
[06:06] but until that point all of these report
[06:09] they were like oh Bitcoin is Bitcoin is
[06:11] dead or Bitcoin is a speculative B
[06:14] Bitcoin is going to die Bitcoin Bitcoin
[06:16] whatever and now it's kind of a shift
[06:19] because they say Bitcoin might might uh
[06:23] like live on but uh if you don't have it
[06:27] uh you're going to be uh in a bad
[06:30] situation so uh you
[06:33] should vote to tax it which is kind of
[06:37] crazy when you think about it because
[06:38] basically they they say if you don't
[06:40] have it you're going to be poorer in a
[06:43] way and there their solution is not then
[06:47] you should buy some or Ina in case it
[06:49] catches them as the famous quote says it
[06:53] but they say if you don't have it
[06:55] basically if you KN kner uh you should
[06:59] um uh vote for for policy that will uh
[07:05] increase taxes on it and basically uh
[07:09] try to uh tax it out of existence which
[07:13] I find it crazy in like philosophic
[07:16] philosophically speaking you know it's
[07:18] it's so it's so crazy for me that like
[07:21] first of all the central bank is saying
[07:23] a lot of things like if you break it
[07:25] down first of all they're saying like oh
[07:26] yeah Bitcoin is going to 10 million uh
[07:29] there's saying if you don't have Bitcoin
[07:31] uh you are poor uh and you better vote
[07:35] for a socialist party that at least is
[07:38] getting some taxes in uh and and then
[07:41] what we also get what you also pointed
[07:43] at is like the central banks are working
[07:45] together and now they're really trying
[07:47] to fight Bitcoin like we are definitely
[07:49] already in the fighting stage maybe even
[07:52] small maybe in some parts even like in
[07:54] the joining stage when we think about
[07:57] Black Rock uh they they definitely
[08:00] joining Bitcoin they're very likely to
[08:03] to it so like uh it's it's in a very
[08:05] interesting time we're living in that
[08:07] that that's the thing and what makes it
[08:10] even more interesting is that uh we we
[08:12] we see both uh both things basically we
[08:15] see like from central banks some some
[08:18] government and some central banks trying
[08:20] to again attack it tax it whatever then
[08:23] we see also as you mentioned it Black
[08:26] Rock and some other companies micro
[08:28] strategy in the in the US uh really
[08:32] involv in it investing in it I also
[08:34] heard recently I think today that
[08:37] Microsoft might again it's not done yet
[08:41] but might buy some uh they they they
[08:44] want to uh have they have a proposal to
[08:46] be voted by their shareholder early
[08:49] December like basically should we buy
[08:51] some do do something like micro strategy
[08:54] for example so you have this kind of
[08:56] more I would say bullish trends and
[08:59] people try to uh starting to understand
[09:03] it and adopt it and on the other side
[09:05] you have some states Some central banks
[09:07] and some again people I guess also more
[09:10] broadly that are
[09:13] still I feel like um they they want to
[09:17] to to break it to uh to attack it but I
[09:21] don't really understand to be honest the
[09:23] the the the the the rational reason for
[09:25] that I feel like it's more again because
[09:28] it doesn't fit there I don't I don't
[09:30] know their world view or they don't
[09:32] really understand it or just just
[09:35] because uh and so you have this two kind
[09:38] of camps that starts to to form and uh
[09:42] and I find I find it interesting but in
[09:46] a way also depending on which side we
[09:49] win uh it might have some different
[09:52] consequences but that's that's funny to
[09:54] see how actually uh again not everyone
[09:58] is uh not everyone agrees on uh on the
[10:01] same uh on the same concept you know
[10:04] like Bitcoin it's it's it's here it
[10:06] exists uh it's it's like it's like math
[10:11] you know there is no interpretation
[10:13] about that or whatever but then you have
[10:16] two different uh sides that see it
[10:19] differently some people see it as hope
[10:22] as a as an innovation as something good
[10:24] for the future and then you have some
[10:25] other people that that see it as a
[10:28] negative feel thing like basically if it
[10:31] continues to prosper uh it will be the
[10:33] end of the world that's kind of crazy to
[10:37] me that that's so uh interesting as you
[10:41] also brought up the Microsoft thing I
[10:43] think that's something that's a case
[10:45] study that it's so interesting because
[10:48] that didn't came up from Microsoft
[10:50] itself it came up from one
[10:52] shareholder uh that uh proposed that uh
[10:55] in the annual meeting and this is super
[10:59] interesting because this one proposal
[11:02] forces Microsoft to put a stance uh in
[11:06] there they they have to have a position
[11:09] now on that and the board decided uh to
[11:12] recommend to vote no which is super
[11:15] interesting because now Microsoft has an
[11:17] official position on bitcoin they're
[11:19] saying no to it and now we have this
[11:22] timestamp where Microsoft said no I mean
[11:25] it's still voted on like in December 9
[11:28] uh this proposal will be voted on but I
[11:30] guess as the board said said no I guess
[11:34] it will not be voted yes so for everyone
[11:36] that is thinking now Microsoft will buy
[11:38] Bitcoin likely not likely not now but at
[11:41] least yeah as you said it's like a first
[11:43] step uh and at least they are starting
[11:46] to uh think about it and it starts to uh
[11:50] yeah become real in a way uh whereas up
[11:54] until then or at least up until 2020
[11:58] when micro strategy about the the first
[12:00] Bitcoins I think most if not all of the
[12:03] companies for them it was like it didn't
[12:06] exist you know it was not in their in
[12:08] their realm of possibility and now it's
[12:11] starting to creep in a little bit
[12:13] they're starting to have to think about
[12:16] it at least maybe they will probably
[12:17] vote no this time but who knows maybe in
[12:20] one year two years someone else will
[12:23] will come and see you and tell them see
[12:26] we you you could have bought two years
[12:28] ago now it's up 400% so maybe we should
[12:33] get some in case it catches on and and
[12:36] we and it starts to to to wall but at
[12:39] least uh yeah absolutely and it could be
[12:43] like it's super interesting how through
[12:46] that Grassroots movements through
[12:48] regular investors uh and through people
[12:51] that are really interested in we are
[12:53] kind of um so loud now that the big
[12:59] companies have to discuss Bitcoin and
[13:03] it's it's it's not a non discussion
[13:04] anymore like because Black Rock and micr
[13:06] strategy and Tesla I did kind of the the
[13:09] the the work but then there's like 100
[13:12] other publicly traded companies on maybe
[13:14] 100 maybe 50 or something like that I
[13:15] don't know what the exact numbers of
[13:17] publicly traded company that have now
[13:19] Bitcoin on the balance sheet and now the
[13:22] big company Microsoft and I can
[13:24] guarantee you apple is talking about it
[13:27] Apple probably has like five employees
[13:29] who's researching Bitcoin I don't know
[13:31] but they probably have like Tim Cook
[13:34] said in one interview I mean a couple
[13:36] years ago that he had he has Bitcoin
[13:39] personally uh and I think I heard
[13:43] uh I I might need to check that but I
[13:46] heard that uh the the Bitcoin white
[13:49] paper had had been shipped into one of
[13:53] Macos releases like uh the you you want
[13:56] the the bitco white paper someone in the
[13:59] system of the Mac that's true I I
[14:02] checked that so yeah that that was
[14:06] actually on the Mac you uh could find it
[14:09] in the Mac systems and if you go to that
[14:13] and like every Mac at some point had the
[14:15] Bitcoin wild paper on there um but they
[14:18] deleted it after it got uh really famous
[14:22] uh they they they cancel it out so right
[14:24] now it's no longer there uh it was
[14:27] probably just an motivated employee who
[14:30] yeah probably hit the file quite good
[14:33] but it's really interesting I I I love
[14:36] to talk about uh how Bitcoin is creeping
[14:40] into the the corporate strategy like we
[14:43] we are uh pushing Bitcoin on the global
[14:47] balance sheet of the world's
[14:49] corporations like how amazing is that
[14:52] that's pretty interesting in need and
[14:54] not only a corporation but it's also
[14:56] governments that are starting to get
[14:59] their feet wet with Bitcoin I obviously
[15:02] there is El Salvador there is a bhon
[15:06] that is started that is mining Bitcoin
[15:09] for now quite a while I think some um uh
[15:13] Middle Eastern uh countries are also
[15:16] starting to at least think about it
[15:18] because they have some excess in energy
[15:20] and so they want to uh to uh put some
[15:24] Bitcoin mining to uh to get some some
[15:27] money or at least not would not waste
[15:30] the energy the excess energy that they
[15:32] have I heard a similar thing about one
[15:36] country in uh South uh South America uh
[15:40] that has a huge um hro hro electric uh
[15:45] Dam a water dam and same thing they have
[15:48] a huge excess of electricity and so they
[15:51] were thinking about uh putting some some
[15:54] mining there there is also a famous
[15:57] story at least in the fren
[15:59] Bitcoin ecosystem about Congo the V
[16:04] virunga Park it's like natural reserve
[16:07] in in Congo um that uh I think two or
[16:12] three years ago um uh put some Bitcoin
[16:17] uh mines some Bitcoin mining in in the
[16:20] park uh because they have again some uh
[16:23] small dams in the in in in the rivers in
[16:26] the park in order to uh bring
[16:29] electricity to the to the population of
[16:31] the park so that they don't have to chop
[16:34] wood and burn wood which uh first is bad
[16:37] for the forest the which is again a
[16:40] national park and also bad for the envir
[16:42] environment because if you burn wood it
[16:45] produce a lot of CO2 emissions uh so
[16:48] there you can see all of this big or
[16:51] small um uh incursion of Bitcoin in
[16:55] multiple places around the world and I
[16:58] again find it fascinating because it's
[17:01] it's really the essence you know of the
[17:02] of of a decentralized system there is no
[17:05] like one master government in the world
[17:08] that says to everyone around the globe
[17:11] now you will use Bitcoin for that it's
[17:12] just that people naturally they try to
[17:15] find solution for their different
[17:17] problems and uh depending on that
[17:19] problem they will uh pick Bitcoin
[17:23] Bitcoin mining or Bitcoin as a currency
[17:25] or or something else to solve their uh
[17:28] their individual problem and I find find
[17:30] it really really
[17:31] interesting I I love that a lot yeah
[17:34] that we we like there is no marketing
[17:37] CEO and we have the best marketing ever
[17:42] like the Bitcoin marketing there's
[17:44] nothing better than that no company has
[17:48] so many podcasts around their product as
[17:52] Bitcoin has like it's it's fascinating
[17:55] to see how effective and great the
[17:59] Bitcoin marketing team is how
[18:01] professional we are and how closely we
[18:03] also kind of working together even
[18:05] though um there is nobody organizing us
[18:08] like there there's nobody that is like
[18:11] oh yeah like Robin now you have to take
[18:13] the podcast out there and he's doing
[18:15] that it's it's we we are all doing
[18:19] what's best for Bitcoin and bitco
[18:21] Bitcoin shows out what's the power of
[18:23] aligning incentives is that that's a
[18:26] great power I feel like from Bitcoin and
[18:29] we see it already with bitcoiners and
[18:31] the the great thing about about all of
[18:34] that is that also it brings together
[18:36] people around a single topic but people
[18:39] who have different again World Views
[18:41] different experiences different they
[18:44] come from different background they
[18:45] might be interested in different things
[18:47] in I don't know politics or or work or
[18:51] whatever but all of these uh people with
[18:55] all of the their differences they come
[18:58] uh they come along along uh behind a
[19:02] single project a single idea because
[19:04] basically Bitcoin is to me I like to say
[19:06] Bitcoin is an idea you know first it's
[19:08] like the idea of sound money and of
[19:12] again freedom and and and much more many
[19:16] other things but they they come together
[19:19] with behind this idea regarding of their
[19:23] differences if there were if there was
[19:25] not Bitcoin maybe there there would I
[19:27] don't know like like we can see in
[19:28] politics in the US today fight fight
[19:32] each other based on their difference but
[19:35] now they put this kind of difference
[19:37] aside and they and they they they share
[19:41] a same interest a same uh goal to see uh
[19:45] to see Bitcoin again spread and uh and
[19:49] and strengthen and I find find it also
[19:51] really really interesting and it to me
[19:54] it's like a good side you know it shows
[19:56] the good side of of people that they are
[19:59] they are able to come along come come
[20:02] along together Beyond one single idea
[20:05] regardless of their uh specific
[20:09] differences uh on on many other
[20:12] topics absolutely yeah it's the only uh
[20:16] Community where a carnivore can sit next
[20:19] to a vegan uh and they don't eat
[20:22] themselves like they don't hate on each
[20:25] other too much they respect each other
[20:28] still yes same thing with also Pol
[20:31] politic political thing because I've
[20:33] heard uh that most of the time people
[20:36] tend to um associate Bitcoin with you
[20:39] know the right um political Spectrum but
[20:43] I've I've seen multiple also people from
[20:47] from the left uh in the US but not only
[20:50] in the US that also uh Embrace Bitcoin
[20:54] and uh defend Bitcoin because again it's
[20:58] uh it when when you when you when you um
[21:02] when you research it and when you when
[21:04] you think about it enough uh you you you
[21:07] see that actually no it it have some
[21:10] some left values if I can speak like
[21:13] that of equality Equity uh and and um
[21:19] and and freedom and and many other other
[21:22] things that basically are are also
[21:25] suited for for for uh different
[21:28] political spectrum and so that's very
[21:32] very interesting because we know that
[21:34] the uh recently on the political side
[21:38] usually people when they don't see the
[21:40] when they they don't endorse the same
[21:42] candidate usually especially in the US
[21:44] but I've seen that in France also
[21:46] recently with the election basically
[21:48] it's like a war but here you see that
[21:51] again people from different political
[21:53] views they can sit together and debate
[21:57] and talk uh and also aign behind Bitcoin
[22:01] and that's that's that's
[22:02] fascinating I I love that a lot yeah
[22:05] that there's even like um uh Bitcoin for
[22:08] Harris movements even though I think uh
[22:11] in in general bit uh Trump seem to be
[22:13] the more obvious candidate if you just
[22:16] uh um shoot for Bitcoin like if if your
[22:19] only policy is uh Bitcoin then I guess
[22:23] Trump is the slightly better candidate
[22:26] uh but I'm not an American
[22:29] I really don't have a lot of clue of
[22:31] American politics uh I think uh there
[22:34] just came out an an interview of trump
[22:37] with with Jo Rogan and I've not watched
[22:40] one single Trump interview so I have
[22:43] really not no clue not clue not a clue
[22:45] about this guy but I think I will watch
[22:47] the The Joe Rogan and Trump interview
[22:49] because it's just like Joe Rogan is such
[22:52] an amazing conversationalist I would say
[22:56] uh and you really get to Noah person
[22:58] when he's sitting with chogan it's not
[23:00] like an interview on TV like it's it's
[23:03] just like an a conversation with two two
[23:06] two people and I will watch that and and
[23:09] maybe then I have a little bit more of
[23:10] an opinion on of trump because I really
[23:12] don't have an opinion on Trump which is
[23:14] an unpopular opinion if you don't have
[23:16] an opinion on
[23:18] Trump yeah but I I I agree with you that
[23:22] podcast usually are more suited for for
[23:26] really deep dive conversation like long
[23:29] form podcast like like ran but there is
[23:33] also another another podcast that the
[23:37] name is is flying over my head right now
[23:40] butman Lex fman exactly it's a a long a
[23:43] long long form podcast also like two or
[23:45] three hours that the guy really goes
[23:48] down deep into topics is he tries to
[23:52] stay um quite objective uh on the on the
[23:57] topic and and and not really lean in one
[23:59] side or the other I've seen that for
[24:02] example for the for the the the upcoming
[24:04] election he's trying to interview I
[24:06] think he did an interview with Trump
[24:07] probably and he's also trying to
[24:09] interviewing to interview some people
[24:11] from the opposite side of the of the
[24:14] political Spectrum to really have a view
[24:17] on on on either either side and I find
[24:20] it I find it again I agree with you much
[24:23] more interesting and much more um uh um
[24:29] yeah interesting than uh than short
[24:33] short TV interviews where usually the
[24:35] the the the interviewer wants to go fast
[24:38] and just put some some tricky question
[24:42] here and there and most of the time you
[24:45] don't really learn a lot of thing here
[24:48] you can really deep dive on topic and uh
[24:51] and that's that's a different way of uh
[24:54] of of interviewing and I think it's uh
[24:58] it's more
[24:59] insightful absolutely yeah Lex Freedman
[25:02] interview Donald Trump I've I've just
[25:04] seen it uh I've not watched it actually
[25:07] also uh but apparently there's no
[25:10] interview with camela Harris I think
[25:12] she's not doing that many podcasts that
[25:14] was a little fishy for for me I don't
[25:16] know I didn't see any any any of the
[25:20] podcast that I watch she's not been on
[25:22] but maybe I just watched the wrong
[25:24] podcast for that uh but yeah I think
[25:27] jogan said even like she he would be um
[25:30] he would great would love a conversation
[25:33] with her uh and and also have have a
[25:36] conversation with her that would be
[25:38] actually great like if you have a long
[25:41] conversation with both parties on jogan
[25:44] I think Jo Rogan would be the best guy
[25:47] to make even a debate on that obviously
[25:50] I think he's probably probably leaning
[25:52] towards Trump um but he is um too good
[25:59] uh for not being like subject like he I
[26:01] think is really good in in just diving
[26:03] deep into topics and not getting like
[26:06] favoring one one guy but yeah just just
[26:10] uh my my thought really good we'll see
[26:12] how it goes because actually it's going
[26:14] to be soon like the the election I think
[26:16] is the the is November no November 5 so
[26:20] it's G to be uh it's going to be quick
[26:23] so we'll see we'll see soon enough how
[26:25] it goes when this is out the election is
[26:28] probably already
[26:30] over
[26:31] maybe uh yeah really cool but let's uh
[26:34] let's come back to the Bitcoin topic um
[26:36] how do you uh Envision actually Bitcoin
[26:39] being adopted in the future we talked
[26:40] about like what's going on currently
[26:42] what's going on in the past how do you
[26:43] envision Bitcoin being adopted by
[26:45] individual corporations countries uh how
[26:48] do you see that in the future great
[26:51] question so my uh my my base Bas Lane
[26:55] base case for that is if no things if
[26:59] nothing changes which means uh we keep
[27:02] on having uh constant and perpet
[27:06] government deficit that will tend I
[27:09] guess to be uh higher and higher because
[27:11] basically uh it's compound interest but
[27:14] against you like you rack on debt and
[27:18] then you have to pay interest on the
[27:20] debt but to pay interest you have to uh
[27:22] get even more uh debts uh so people will
[27:27] um
[27:29] uh uh start we we we want to find U an
[27:34] exit uh out of this of this system uh
[27:38] some some faster than over because again
[27:42] when I when I'm talking about uh people
[27:44] that I know friends uh and colleagues
[27:47] and whatnot that uh that that are not uh
[27:52] deep into Bitcoin as I as I might be uh
[27:55] for them it's it's it's really it's
[27:58] really far it's really remote I feel
[27:59] like we are still in like 2020 for
[28:01] sometime for sometimes because they they
[28:04] are still saying like biton is boiling
[28:06] the ocean it's it's bad for the
[28:08] environment which has been debunked
[28:11] scientifically speaking multiple time
[28:14] since then uh it's like one of the most
[28:19] wrong statements about Bitcoin that can
[28:22] uh that there can be today uh but again
[28:26] if if people don't um don't research it
[28:30] and also if they listen to I would say
[28:34] misinformed uh sources
[28:38] so they might get some some bad idea
[28:41] about that but with that part uh as I
[28:44] said if we keep on uh our current path
[28:47] of uh increasing uh deficits increasing
[28:51] spending increasing debt uh people will
[28:55] uh want we they will see that something
[28:58] is I hope at least I hope they will see
[29:01] that something is is off something is
[29:03] odd and they will want to to to find a
[29:05] way out you know uh people uh usually
[29:09] people at least uh in the US and I start
[29:12] to see that in France a bit even even
[29:14] though we are much less into investing
[29:17] but they they start to invest a bit in
[29:19] the stock market and and this this kind
[29:22] of thing especially since 2020 but they
[29:25] so they start to get interested in that
[29:27] in this kind of thing and they might uh
[29:31] jump from that to bitcoin at some point
[29:34] when they see that maybe investing in
[29:37] the stock market is more like a a
[29:40] gumball and also it's it's barely
[29:43] keeping up with inflation I think it's
[29:45] like Michael sailor that that said that
[29:48] I I didn't uh check the I didn't do the
[29:51] the the exact research on that but he
[29:54] said that basically if you if you invest
[29:56] in the in the S&P 500 you're just
[29:59] trading water with Monet monetary
[30:02] inflation it's like it's growing 7 10% a
[30:05] year and monetary inflation is is kind
[30:07] of the same so actually it's a that's
[30:12] that's kind of that's kind of an issue
[30:14] so maybe they will see they will see
[30:17] a a hope in Bitcoin I at least that that
[30:21] that's how I see I see it but the the
[30:25] the the issue that we can that we can
[30:29] have is that uh people might uh uh take
[30:34] a lot of time to see this this kind of
[30:37] thing and we we might have to wait uh
[30:41] for them to to to really getting hurt a
[30:45] lot I would I would say by by this
[30:47] monetary inflation before they start to
[30:49] ask question it's like the the boiling
[30:52] frog you know you put a frog in a in a
[30:55] pot of water and you you increase the
[30:57] temperature
[30:58] slightly slightly slightly uh the the
[31:03] frog in the in the pot of water is is
[31:05] just chilling doesn't uh doesn't notice
[31:08] that the water is uh is uh is increasing
[31:12] that the temperature is increasing and
[31:14] uh and kind of ends up boil so I hope we
[31:18] don't end up in this situation that
[31:22] basically people end up boiled by all of
[31:25] this monetary inflation and all of this
[31:28] kind of stuff before they discover
[31:30] Bitcoin I partnered up with coin
[31:34] vigilante this is the most beautiful

[33:40] level up your
[33:43] sovereignty I have uh an interesting
[33:46] chart here um for the people that are
[33:49] just listening to this um I basically
[33:52] pulled up a chart where you can see the
[33:54] US money supply M2 and S&P 500 Index
[34:00] which is super interesting because they
[34:02] kind of track each other of course it's
[34:04] not a perfect correlation and right now
[34:07] the index is a little bit above uh what
[34:09] the US uh monetary uh us uh money
[34:13] supplies but there's an super uh big
[34:17] correlation between those two uh and
[34:19] it's it's amazing to see obviously
[34:22] people also then go here again then uh
[34:25] go and and say like oh the same is true
[34:27] for Bitcoin yeah to a certain extent
[34:30] obviously as you also said in your base
[34:32] case when money is
[34:36] printed assets go up money goes down so
[34:41] that's a very simple Supply and that
[34:44] people want or that people need uh yes
[34:47] they they they go up in in a they go up
[34:49] in price that's why we see um real
[34:52] estate going up in price stocks going up
[34:55] in price in France in in France for
[34:57] examp
[34:58] uh people are much more invested in in
[35:01] in real estate than they might be in the
[35:03] stock market for example uh so uh so I I
[35:08] can see I can see that and the the nice
[35:11] thing with with Bitcoin and that's
[35:13] that's something that I I I find really
[35:16] powerful also is that um basically on a
[35:19] on an individual basis it has no mainten
[35:23] maintenance cost because for example
[35:24] real estate you have to put at I don't
[35:27] know like 10% a year to pay all of the
[35:31] things that you need to repair taxes
[35:32] whatever uh you have it also consume
[35:35] takes time to to to handle all of that
[35:38] uh the stock market there is a little
[35:41] bit of uh of um of cost because you you
[35:45] have the the fees and and stuff like
[35:48] that but with Bitcoin uh you don't have
[35:51] all of that and the most um the most
[35:55] powerful thing to me is that uh you can
[35:58] take it with you and uh go anywhere you
[36:02] want uh like in in in an instant
[36:07] basically whereas your your your real
[36:09] estate or your stock it's much more
[36:12] complicated if you need to leave to uh
[36:15] to take it with
[36:16] you yeah and and and it's it's so great
[36:19] uh I think I love the side price in
[36:21] Bitcoin as you mentioned it uh when you
[36:23] start pricing PE uh things in Bitcoin
[36:26] there you can clearly see uh like the
[36:30] the price in
[36:31] Bitcoin uh what it was uh I think like
[36:35] there obviously like 201 uh 12 like
[36:38] 40,000 Bitcoin obviously that's uh
[36:41] that's quite early uh but even if you go
[36:44] back to
[36:45] 2020 uh there let's say January 2020 a
[36:49] house new house price and average house
[36:51] price in America was 45 Bitcoin uh now
[36:56] we're down to six bitco coin so the the
[37:00] house prices are completely
[37:03] crashing in Bitcoin yes because if you
[37:07] if you if you if you pull up the same
[37:09] chart in US dollar in Euro or whatever
[37:12] currency you you are using uh the the
[37:16] graph will be on the on the opposite
[37:19] side it will go it will go up so that's
[37:22] really uh that's really interesting
[37:24] absolutely and then uh also just to to
[37:27] show you quickly um you also can see the
[37:31] equity markets so we talked before about
[37:34] the
[37:34] s00 uh and oh let's let's let's
[37:38] concentrate on that side really quickly
[37:40] there is everything R everything is
[37:43] going down against Bitcoin in the equity
[37:46] Market it's so fascinating for again for
[37:49] those people that are just listening uh
[37:51] there's basically US dollar uh crude oil
[37:54] gold S&P 500 uh the real estate market
[37:59] uh all it to uh summarize on one page
[38:03] and on a daily on a weekly on a monthly
[38:05] on a year-to date on a onee chart on
[38:07] three years chart five years charts and
[38:10] everything is red right now so
[38:13] everything is going down against Bitcoin
[38:16] uh no matter what you're looking at and
[38:18] that's really really uh interesting to
[38:21] see and and really I think a powerful
[38:23] sign for uh the the the bitcoiners
[38:26] because you you are just holding the
[38:28] best asset ever and everything else is
[38:33] going down was going down and will go
[38:35] down in the future which is which is
[38:39] also uh a good thing because basically
[38:43] if you if you if we go to to to First
[38:46] principle when you so when you when you
[38:48] work and you get your salary for example
[38:50] at the end of the month and you you are
[38:52] lucky enough to uh manage your budget
[38:56] wisely and basically have uh excess
[38:59] money you don't you don't really want to
[39:01] use this money right now or you don't
[39:03] have to use this money right now you
[39:04] want to save it for uh buying a house
[39:07] later or going on vacation later so the
[39:10] the nice thing with Bitcoin is that you
[39:12] don't have to overthink it you just okay
[39:15] take you I don't know maybe I save 10%
[39:17] 15% okay I take my 15% I put them into
[39:21] Bitcoin and when I want to buy something
[39:25] later down the road so it's it might not
[39:27] be true today because there is a lot of
[39:30] volatility so if I want to buy something
[39:32] 3 months from now maybe it's not the the
[39:34] best idea to put it into Bitcoin but
[39:36] conceptually speaking I I I just save it
[39:39] so into a good savings vehicle which is
[39:42] Bitcoin and then later down the road
[39:44] when I want to buy a house a car go on a
[39:47] holiday with my family I just take this
[39:50] saved uh capital and I can uh buy it and
[39:54] and I can buy things with it and it
[39:56] didn't decrease in P in purchasing power
[40:00] which is not the case today if you just
[40:03] take your uh your saving and put them on
[40:06] your bank account or even on a regulated
[40:09] savings account that might yield two or
[40:12] 3% uh you end up as we saw with with the
[40:16] with the charts you you put you end up
[40:18] basically losing uh per purchasing power
[40:21] because uh uh because of monetary
[40:24] inflation and increases in in prices
[40:27] and this again we we also talk about
[40:30] incentive this incentivize people to uh
[40:34] to take some extra risk with their uh
[40:38] with their savings because basically
[40:40] they they now they invested in the stock
[40:42] market the stock marketing the stock
[40:43] market is be has become the the savings
[40:47] vehicle of of a lot of people which is
[40:49] not his its first uh purpose you know
[40:52] you invest in the stock market because
[40:55] you invest in a company you think this
[40:56] company will do well in the future uh
[40:59] you you you invest in the company
[41:00] because you like the product because
[41:02] there is a faren reason to invest in a
[41:04] company but today what most people do
[41:08] they just take their uh savings and
[41:11] automatically they put them in the stock
[41:13] market because they they are they think
[41:15] like or they feel like yeah okay it's
[41:17] GNA at least save my purchasing power
[41:21] which basically uh we are using a tool
[41:25] for the we for the not the wrong purpose
[41:28] but a different purpose that than it was
[41:31] built for in the in the first place so
[41:33] that's uh that's that kind have that can
[41:37] have some some different effect down the
[41:40] road that we might not know today for
[41:43] example one that come in the top of my
[41:45] mind but I might be wrong on that but uh
[41:48] is basically um uh since we we put money
[41:54] in in an index fund and the index BAS
[41:57] basically will redistribute their the
[41:59] money in in the different company for
[42:01] example in the S&P 5 500 you have the
[42:04] the top companies that will get a lot of
[42:06] money basically from all of this P
[42:09] passive flow even though maybe this
[42:12] might not be uh the the best company in
[42:15] the whole stock market and also this um
[42:19] you you you end up with with some
[42:22] monopolies that are formed and that are
[42:24] that can be hard to uh to overcome
[42:27] uh because basically these top companies
[42:30] in the stock market uh they they attract
[42:33] a lot of capital and so some other
[42:36] newcomer company like outstander they
[42:40] can't they they might not get the the
[42:43] financing that they need to propose a
[42:47] new solution that might be cheaper
[42:49] better or whatever and so you kind of
[42:52] end up in a in in in a grid loock you
[42:54] know things don't really move
[42:57] anymore because the the the top company
[43:00] stay at the top and the little company
[43:02] at the bottom they can't really R
[43:04] because they don't get the financing I
[43:05] don't know that's just a a train of
[43:08] thought that I
[43:09] had it's a it's a true train of thought
[43:12] um one thing before we go down that road
[43:15] I I want to just add um you said
[43:18] something about gambling and I think
[43:21] stock market investing like if you
[43:23] invest in a company that you don't own
[43:27] uh and you didn't do any research in
[43:30] that company that's just gambling like
[43:33] you're just hoping to make money with
[43:35] that that's gambling you can go in the
[43:36] casino and then it's interesting uh when
[43:39] you uh then go ahead and buy an ETF what
[43:43] is an ETF ETF is just like a lot of
[43:46] companies uh included in one thing
[43:49] obviously there can be Bitcoin ETFs and
[43:51] other things but usually like the
[43:52] Bitcoin uh like uh like stock uh ETFs or
[43:56] something like that uh that is just uh
[44:00] bundled gambling like you don't know
[44:03] what companies are there what what are
[44:05] they doing you're just hoping that
[44:07] someone is making a good decision on
[44:10] investing in in that company so it's all
[44:12] just like a bundled gambling thing and
[44:17] that that's that's not that's not what
[44:18] saving is and you don't know if you are
[44:20] doing a a good investment again because
[44:23] we are talking about investment in the
[44:25] stock market you might buy uh basically
[44:27] company that are overvalued for example
[44:30] uh or or that are yeah too expensive for
[44:33] what they actually bring in Revenue in
[44:36] cash or for their future earnings
[44:39] perspective but since again you don't
[44:42] really um do any any any research and
[44:46] you just automatically invest in this
[44:49] company uh regularly you don't really uh
[44:52] you don't really know that you might be
[44:55] investing in some overvalued company or
[44:58] or some uh yeah some company that might
[45:01] end up uh uh not not giving you a good
[45:07] return on Capital in a in in a
[45:09] reasonable um time frame and that's why
[45:13] micro strategy outperformed every single
[45:16] S&P 500 stock since they adopted a
[45:19] Bitcoin standard like that's the single
[45:22] reason for that they don't have an
[45:25] amazing business model that uh is super
[45:28] exciting with with AI or whatever I mean
[45:31] they're doing great uh uh business in in
[45:34] general but it's not like an Nvidia yeah
[45:38] they're not revolutionizing their their
[45:40] industry it's like I think it's like a
[45:42] business intelligence company they are
[45:44] doing software like like a lot of other
[45:48] companies in the world but yeah they
[45:51] have this Edge against all of the other
[45:53] companies so I think people more more
[45:56] get it
[45:57] that we need Bitcoin and and we don't
[46:00] need like stock gambling or real estate
[46:03] houses with 30-year mortgages as a
[46:05] savings vehicle I think that's gets
[46:08] clearer and clearer with every day um
[46:11] what then also comes to my mind when we
[46:13] have all those companies and they get
[46:15] feeded with the feed money printer that
[46:18] that creates a lot of zombie companies
[46:20] that are just alive because yeah they
[46:23] benefit from the uh Fe money printer
[46:26] what what your F on that no that that's
[46:28] true
[46:29] uh I mean we we we kind of saw that
[46:33] during the the covid uh the covid period
[46:37] uh so again there are some pros and some
[46:40] cons about that but some company I don't
[46:43] I don't know if most company or what but
[46:46] some company at least they they survived
[46:49] during the the co period because of some
[46:52] stimulus and some other things like that
[46:55] uh and they
[46:58] whereas in a in a normal environment I
[47:03] would say this company that might not be
[47:06] profitable they would just have ceased
[47:08] to exist and so the the the capital that
[47:12] was um flowing to this company and that
[47:15] was basically at the end of the day uh
[47:18] uh um wasted because if you invest in a
[47:22] company that uh is not uh producing
[47:27] something of of value or valuable enough
[47:30] for the for the money you you you put in
[47:33] basically the the company is burning is
[47:34] burning money uh so you so it's it's a
[47:38] destruction of capital um and and this
[47:40] money could have been better allocated
[47:43] maybe elsewhere and also the people that
[47:45] were working in these companies uh might
[47:48] have been uh better again allocated in a
[47:51] way uh working in some other companies
[47:55] but I guess Al I get also so the the
[47:57] overp part of the of the of the debate
[48:00] which is yes but this was a crisis uh if
[48:03] people were were left out of of a job at
[48:07] this time they would have been uh extra
[48:10] um vulnerable and also we didn't really
[48:13] know how long the the crisis was going
[48:15] to last and what not so I get both sides
[48:17] of the argument but uh an even uh more
[48:21] more interesting uh argument based on
[48:23] that is also again linked maybe to uh
[48:27] uh ETFs and investing as a saving
[48:30] vehicle today is that people since they
[48:32] just funnel money into uh the stock
[48:36] market they might uh invest uh without
[48:40] knowing it again because they just do it
[48:42] automatically in some zombie company
[48:45] that just stay alive because they get uh
[48:48] a new injected Capital regularly through
[48:51] the stock market because the people are
[48:53] just basically uh uh throwing everywhere
[48:57] basically I'm just buying everything
[48:59] instead of really picking my companies
[49:01] so if I'm buying everything I'm also
[49:04] buying some uh some zombie company or
[49:07] some company that are uh not uh
[49:10] productive enough and that are not and
[49:13] and and that end up um destroying
[49:16] capital I think I saw statistic about
[49:18] that again I didn't double check that
[49:22] it's been it's been a while but in the
[49:25] S&P 500 uh um I like there is there was
[49:30] only uh a small part of the 500
[49:34] something companies listed in the vendex
[49:36] that were actually uh earning money or
[49:39] not earning money but uh uh that that
[49:42] had a a positive return on Capital most
[49:45] of the uh most of the I don't know maybe
[49:48] it's like uh 20 8020 I don't know but um
[49:53] most of the companies were actually uh
[49:57] um destroying capital in a way they were
[50:00] not um uh they were they did not have a
[50:05] positive return and only the like top
[50:08] companies had a positive return but
[50:10] since the they this company were so big
[50:12] they they were uh pulling the whole
[50:15] index up but if you really dove into the
[50:19] the detail you could see that most of
[50:22] the company in the in the index were
[50:24] actually uh burning capital so uh so
[50:28] that's also an an interesting thing is
[50:30] like yeah okay maybe uh if we invest all
[50:33] of this money in in the index uh like uh
[50:38] blindly we are also uh making some
[50:42] unprofitable company or maybe not
[50:44] unprofitable but uh uh companies that uh
[50:48] we we are putting money in companies
[50:50] whereas we could put this this same
[50:53] money in in companies that would be more
[50:55] uh that would have a better return on
[50:57] Capital and would use basically this
[50:59] Capital better to uh to improve
[51:04] Society build Innovation or or what not
[51:07] but uh but we just uh yeah we just spray
[51:10] the money around and so this companies
[51:13] stay on living maybe longer than they
[51:15] should they should
[51:17] have yeah in general uh I just
[51:21] researched if I can find a exact
[51:23] statistic I think it's like 30% of the
[51:25] companies or even less than that
[51:27] actually make a positive return of an
[51:29] investment uh for the investors in the
[51:31] S&P 500 obviously uh S&P 500 as uh
[51:36] performance is not that great like the
[51:39] Golden Era of the S&P 500 is kind of
[51:42] over uh and obviously then uh if if the
[51:47] return of investment is like barely
[51:49] positive then obviously there are some
[51:52] uh very negative companies and then some
[51:55] very positive companies is also uh it's
[51:59] yeah it's it's it's just interesting to
[52:01] look at those kind of developments that
[52:04] that that we live through um one one
[52:07] thing that I want to also get into
[52:09] because we touched on it a little bit uh
[52:12] but I think we should get a little bit
[52:14] into that um the thing that the ECP is
[52:17] touching on with wealth
[52:20] distribution um which is interesting
[52:22] that earlier bitcoiners obviously um uh
[52:27] benefit from being early in Bitcoin
[52:29] which is I think an extreme fair thing
[52:32] because of a lot of reasons but what are
[52:33] you what are your thoughts uh on that
[52:36] argument that people should should get
[52:39] get get early into Bitcoin obviously
[52:42] yeah yeah I I find this argument kind of
[52:45] silly in a way because basically that's
[52:48] uh yeah that That's the basis of any
[52:51] Investments uh the those those that get
[52:54] in early uh
[52:57] have more benefit I mean financially
[53:01] speaking than than those that get in
[53:04] that getting late I I don't know for
[53:05] example if we talk about Amazon uh those
[53:09] that invested in Amazon in the early
[53:12] 2000 and and that uh kept on holding
[53:17] through the do bubble and everything
[53:19] after that and that now uh still have
[53:22] the the stock yes they made a huge
[53:25] return on that
[53:27] uh but I don't see the European Central
[53:29] Bank writing a paper on early adopters
[53:33] of of Amazon or apple or Tesla or
[53:36] whatever else company you know so to me
[53:38] it's like it's it's kind of silly this
[53:42] this arguments and the the the the the
[53:45] the yeah the the the the even more silly
[53:48] part is like the the conclusion
[53:50] basically because the conclusion is uh
[53:53] uh you you should uh I mean basically
[53:56] I'm paraphrasing but they should be
[53:58] taxed uh heavily uh for for for that uh
[54:04] yeah an alternative is also for uh
[54:09] people that don't hold Bitcoin today
[54:12] that again uh get some in case it
[54:15] catches and you know uh so so that from
[54:20] one single uh starting point you you can
[54:24] get to basically you you get to the
[54:27] conclusion that you want and I feel like
[54:31] that that that that's what they they're
[54:32] trying to do they have they already um
[54:36] preconceived conclusion that they want
[54:38] to uh to come to you know basically
[54:41] their conclusion is Bitcoin is bad it
[54:43] should be banned it's going to be the
[54:45] end of the world and whatever whatever
[54:47] and from that they just uh build their
[54:51] argument and their paper based on that
[54:54] but basically the the the the end
[54:57] the the end conclusion never changed for
[54:59] them it's just that every every single
[55:02] paper they they they build a different
[55:05] arguments as I said earlier it was
[55:08] Bitcoin is a speculative bubble then
[55:11] Bitcoin is dead because the paper was
[55:13] published I don't know in in like 2022
[55:17] or whatever when it was the bare market
[55:19] now that it's starting to get traction a
[55:22] bit more they they they they get another
[55:25] uh another angle of attack another
[55:28] argument against it or at least they try
[55:32] so um but the if we if we think again
[55:35] about if we think about that um and and
[55:38] we step we take a step uh a step back uh
[55:44] the like that to me that that's not
[55:48] their their mission their Mand mandate
[55:51] they I mean it's like a public uh
[55:55] organization that is paid with taxpayer
[55:57] money so European taxpayer money my
[56:00] money your money everyone that that
[56:02] lives in the EU and basically they uh
[56:05] use their time to write
[56:08] uh a shitty paper in a way because I'm
[56:12] not saying shitty because uh I I don't
[56:15] agree with their with their view but
[56:17] it's just that the arguments are really
[56:19] bad uh and the the paper is poorly
[56:22] written I didn't read it from uh from
[56:25] start to finish but I've read multiple
[56:27] um I've read some some part of it and
[56:30] also multiple um analysis of the of the
[56:33] paper and the the the the the conclusion
[56:37] is the same basically that there are the
[56:40] arguments are really poor uh not well
[56:43] researched and are just made so that
[56:47] they can uh defend their uh their own uh
[56:52] conclusion that uh like their their
[56:55] personal conclusion that they want to
[56:56] they they want to put out it's not it's
[56:58] not like scientific paper you know that
[57:00] is objective and that that goes from we
[57:03] we we don't have any uh uh preconceived
[57:08] view on that and we will do some
[57:10] research and uh and come to to a
[57:13] conclusion it's the overw one they have
[57:15] a conclusion they want to share or they
[57:17] want to put into the world and they
[57:19] build their paper from that so uh yeah
[57:22] again as I was saying to me it's not
[57:24] their it's not their mission have some
[57:26] uh some better things to do with our
[57:29] money and uh and and that's crazy and
[57:32] and again they they WR it about Bitcoin
[57:35] but they could write a similar thing
[57:36] about any other basically investment you
[57:39] know uh that that that's
[57:42] silly just like
[57:44] Mindless um European central banks
[57:48] soldiers try trying to make up some some
[57:51] arguments in there and it's also um I
[57:54] think
[57:57] I've spoken with a lot of bitcoiners and
[57:59] also a lot of early bitcoiners um most
[58:03] of them lost their Bitcoin along the way
[58:06] most of them sold their Bitcoin along
[58:09] the way and those few people who
[58:12] actually stomached the such a big
[58:16] volatility and had a knowledge about the
[58:19] great technology uh not losing in mg
[58:23] having a great self custody setup not
[58:24] losing it like that and additionally to
[58:28] do that had the for side where Bitcoin
[58:31] is actually going they deserve that like
[58:35] if if someone bought a thousand Bitcoin
[58:38] uh and stomach the volatility uh didn't
[58:41] uh screw up the the technology around it
[58:45] lost did not did not sell it uh even
[58:48] though they saw their netw worth
[58:50] skyrocketing they 100% deserve it and
[58:55] they should be hilariously Rich they did
[58:58] something that almost nobody was even
[59:02] thinking about and that's that that's
[59:05] how I think about it like it's obviously
[59:08] it's like hard to stop like oh he bought
[59:10] Bitcoin for like one year and I have to
[59:13] buy it for like 60,000 EUR that's not
[59:15] fair but that's a very very stupid
[59:18] perspective on that because there's a
[59:20] lot of work that has to be done for in
[59:23] order to do that yeah that that's that's
[59:25] decentive
[59:26] basically investment risk taking uh in a
[59:31] way
[59:32] entrepreneurship a bit as well uh and
[59:36] and also it's
[59:39] uh a view a mindset that is a bit weird
[59:43] basically because okay you you you took
[59:46] some risk or you or or even if it's not
[59:49] risk it's just luck okay you you get
[59:52] lucky so now give us uh part of your
[59:56] your of your earning and I guess huge
[59:59] part of the of the
[60:01] earnings uh because we will know we will
[60:03] know better than you what to do with
[60:06] with this money yes but no let me uh I
[60:11] doubt I doubt that you know that that's
[60:13] funny because we were talking about
[60:15] again the the budget that is being voted
[60:17] in France currently and that the same
[60:19] thing in in in many countries and in I I
[60:23] don't know of any single at least on the
[60:26] top of my mind that uh has a well
[60:29] balanced budget you know that is not in
[60:31] a basically in debt in deficit so you
[60:35] you have this this side of things like
[60:37] basically governments and Central
[60:39] entities are running deficit are in debt
[60:42] and so now they are trying to get
[60:46] excited like oh the deficit is is is
[60:50] huge maybe we should raise taxes and and
[60:53] and whatnot and on the other side things
[60:56] they they say oh you earn some money
[60:59] give us the money we will know better
[61:00] what to do with
[61:02] that doesn't doesn't add up you
[61:05] know so that's kind of crazy that's it's
[61:08] an amazing VI it's a I love how you look
[61:11] at it really cool um perfect one last
[61:14] thing that I want to get into is you
[61:16] said there's a link between health and
[61:20] Bitcoin what is that so um I'm thinking
[61:24] about it because uh I'm now I'm now
[61:27] working in a in a healthcare preventive
[61:30] Healthcare startup and the the the goal
[61:34] of the of the company is to um is to
[61:37] increase your your um your your time uh
[61:41] your your health span but in good health
[61:44] you know and that made me think also
[61:46] about bit Bitcoin and a link with
[61:49] Bitcoin because basically when you
[61:50] huddle Bitcoin you have a long time uh a
[61:53] long time preference you you don't want
[61:56] to I don't know spend your Bitcoin in
[61:58] two days or or what not you want to hold
[62:00] it for uh for future use and maybe give
[62:04] it to your your future generation and
[62:07] that made me think about that because
[62:09] when you when you have uh when you have
[62:11] Bitcoin and when you are you you uh you
[62:14] you adhere to the Bitcoin also mindset
[62:18] and uh and uh and culture in a way uh
[62:23] the the this uh like taking good care of
[62:26] your health is really uh is really
[62:29] important and and makes sense and so
[62:32] that just made me think about that
[62:33] quickly because uh before that I was
[62:36] working for in the in the in the in the
[62:39] crypto industry and um and I made this
[62:43] this jump for uh for this reason because
[62:47] also because I'm really interested in in
[62:49] healthare and when you when you start to
[62:53] take um to take care of your health uh
[62:57] you you start to um
[63:01] basically uh view your uh basically you
[63:05] you your Bitcoin kind of get more
[63:08] valuable to you because you know that
[63:10] you might be able to use them in a in a
[63:13] in
[63:14] a longer uh longer time Horizon if I
[63:18] know that I for example if I know that I
[63:21] that I'm going to die in in in five
[63:23] weeks uh I don't have the same uh
[63:26] the same incentive you know regarding my
[63:28] Bitcoin and regarding saving than if I
[63:31] work in in if if I if I die in in 50
[63:36] years so basically uh taking good care
[63:38] of your health is really is also
[63:40] important uh um uh to to uh to use your
[63:47] your money later than down the world and
[63:49] what made me think about that is that uh
[63:52] in in Bitcoin since we we
[63:56] we we come from a short time preference
[64:01] to basically increase your your your
[64:04] time your time preference uh getting
[64:06] invol in in involved in Bitcoin uh you
[64:09] kind you start to get uh to to get more
[64:12] interested in this kind of topics you
[64:15] know Health uh basically improving your
[64:17] health and uh and living living longer
[64:21] so that's that was just a quick F that I
[64:24] had I love that but it's really I think
[64:28] it's it it speaks a lot to what Bitcoin
[64:32] can do uh for society when we uh think
[64:36] long term and what we uh think uh about
[64:39] Bitcoin in general um one last thing why
[64:43] is Bitcoin special to
[64:44] you huh great question um
[64:49] so from two uh I will say two two thing
[64:53] about that the the the first thing is
[64:55] that uh I I've always been uh like a a
[65:01] um I I've always been a saor you know
[65:04] like saving money trying to earn more
[65:07] that I that I that I spend and also I
[65:09] don't really buy a crazy every
[65:12] weeks because that's not really my my
[65:15] thing I don't it doesn't bring me me joy
[65:18] that's not who I am so I've always been
[65:21] a saver and as we mentioned uh earlier
[65:24] Bitcoin is kind of a the perfect saving
[65:28] technology and also um uh uh so I I'm
[65:33] working in I'm I'm an engineer by by
[65:36] trade so I I I have an engineering
[65:38] degree so I'm really interested in
[65:39] everything technology and Bitcoin uh is
[65:44] to me uh a great in invention or
[65:48] Discovery because technologically
[65:50] speaking uh it's uh simple and I like I
[65:54] like a simple thing uh it's simple
[65:56] compared to you might some other
[65:58] cryptocurrencies or some other system
[66:01] it's it's simple it works it's solid
[66:05] it's robust and it's really powerful
[66:09] because again as we mentioned also
[66:11] through a different incentives uh it
[66:14] allows you uh it allows a lot of
[66:17] different things uh so we mentioned
[66:20] mining we mentioned red uh increase the
[66:23] time preference and and of these things
[66:26] and so that's basically the the two
[66:29] things that uh that that are important
[66:32] for me in in Bitcoin and that made me
[66:35] interested in that really cool I love it
[66:38] a lot uh really cool uh one question
[66:41] that every one of my um guests get is
[66:45] what can we learn from you besides
[66:47] Bitcoin great question
[66:50] um so I just uh I guess I just uh teased
[66:55] a bit about that in my in my previous
[66:57] question answer but uh as I said I'm I'm
[67:01] really um into into optimization uh
[67:06] saving so saving to me is like
[67:08] optimization you have a certain amount
[67:11] of money and you want to uh you want to
[67:14] to do the most with with this resources
[67:17] so I'm really into uh into optimization
[67:20] so that goes through finance and not
[67:22] only that for example I like I love
[67:25] doing doing uh my own repairs in my in
[67:28] my Apartments you know if there is
[67:30] something that is broken I'm not going
[67:31] to call someone to fix it I will I will
[67:34] look look up on the Internet okay how do
[67:36] how do you do that and now we've open
[67:39] with ch GPT and whatnot it's even easier
[67:42] to learn something and again I I love
[67:46] also learning new learning new topics
[67:49] learning new things basically broadening
[67:51] my uh my my world view uh because
[67:55] I have a feeling that if you when when
[67:58] you stop when you stop learning things
[68:00] basically you're dead you know the one
[68:03] of the goal of life is to continue also
[68:06] learning continuously to improve improve
[68:09] your life and improve the life of others
[68:11] so that's also something that I'm really
[68:13] interested about uh continuous learning
[68:16] and Discovery and again that's also why
[68:19] I'm really interested into Bitcoin
[68:20] because uh when you start to uh dive
[68:23] into the topic you learn a lot of thing
[68:26] on very different topics absolutely if
[68:29] you if you stop learning if you stop
[68:31] progressing uh you are decreasing your
[68:34] you're moving back basically in in in
[68:37] some sense yeah really really cool I
[68:39] love that a lot um we have an ENT in the
[68:41] podcast where the previous guest is
[68:43] asking a question for the next guest
[68:45] without knowing who the next guest
[68:46] actually is and your question from the
[68:48] previous guest is what's what central
[68:51] bank will be the first one to adopt uh
[68:54] Bitcoin or buy some Bitcoin very good
[68:56] question
[68:58] uh on the top of my head I would say uh
[69:01] I would say
[69:03] Switzerland I would say I would say
[69:05] Switzerland uh obviously uh not talking
[69:09] about El Salvador because uh I feel I
[69:12] mean I don't know if they really have a
[69:14] central bank but they are no they don't
[69:16] have a um they don't have a currency uh
[69:20] they probably have a national bank or
[69:23] something like that uh but uh they they
[69:26] cannot Brint their own money uh that and
[69:29] that's kind of what he he meant with
[69:31] with with
[69:32] that Swiss frank would be amazing I I
[69:35] think Swiss and I will I I I will get uh
[69:39] I will get some some pointer to that
[69:41] again maybe I will be totally wrong
[69:43] we'll see in the future but what what
[69:45] make me think about Switzerland is that
[69:48] um so first of all uh Swiss is like a
[69:51] Switzerland is a is is kind of a
[69:53] decentralized country uh you have
[69:55] multiple counts it's like it's kind of a
[69:57] small country also so it's not like in
[69:59] the US where when you want to have this
[70:02] kind of change it might take longer
[70:06] um uh if I remember if I if I remember
[70:09] correctly I think that's one of the last
[70:10] country that was on um on a gold
[70:14] standard I think they they left the they
[70:16] deped their current currency from gold
[70:19] in the late 1990s early 2000 if I
[70:23] remember correctly um and also uh so
[70:28] I you you see that uh in in Switzerland
[70:31] there are really uh I would say agnostic
[70:34] about Bitcoin
[70:36] uh contrary to some other European
[70:39] countries where basically uh Bitcoin
[70:43] they they don't say no to bitcoin you
[70:44] know there is a lot there are a lot of
[70:46] companies uh that are based in
[70:48] Switzerland that are Bitcoin company for
[70:50] example there is a relay that is a good
[70:52] company that is based there and they
[70:54] they can basically uh uh put some
[70:58] Bitcoin in their treasury they can uh
[71:01] bootstrap a company uh using Bitcoin
[71:04] whereas for example I take France as a
[71:06] as a as a comparison in France if you
[71:09] want to start a company you must have a
[71:11] bank account and you can't just come and
[71:14] say okay I have $10,000 in Bitcoin
[71:18] that's the starting capital of my
[71:19] company and go for there go from there
[71:21] no in Switzerland you can it's really um
[71:24] it's much more easier to do that and my
[71:27] last point is that um uh I think the
[71:31] Swiss National Bank uh the Swiss Central
[71:34] Bank uh bought some mro strategy uh
[71:38] stocks uh recently a couple months ago I
[71:41] think in
[71:43] their um yeah in their in their Central
[71:47] Bank like as part of their assets uh and
[71:50] I guess they didn't B buy mro strategy
[71:53] uh just because
[71:56] there might be a reason behind that and
[71:58] I think the reason is to get exposed to
[72:00] bitcoin so maybe they don't want to buy
[72:02] Bitcoin right now for some reason maybe
[72:04] it's like some political reason some
[72:06] regulatory reason or whatnot but uh at
[72:09] least U at least they are interested in
[72:12] that so that's that's uh that would be
[72:15] my answer we'll see in the future if I'm
[72:17] right or not they they actually did it's
[72:21] amazing that they they're doing it I
[72:22] love that a lot really really cool
