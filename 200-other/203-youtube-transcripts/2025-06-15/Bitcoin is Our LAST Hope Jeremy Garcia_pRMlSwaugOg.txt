[00:00] there is not one person except for I
[00:02] guess Satoshi Nakamoto that truly are
[00:04] Anonymous on Earth do we even have
[00:05] privacy at this point Bitcoin is the
[00:07] last stand for privacy do we actually
[00:10] have free speech the dark web
[00:12] essentially was developed by the Navy as
[00:14] a means to provide their employees a way
[00:16] to whistleblow anonymously they don't
[00:18] have to manage an ETF they don't have to
[00:21] pick stocks they don't have to find out
[00:23] which bond to buy this year which
[00:26] portfolio to balance out and diversify
[00:29] it's just Bitcoin owning scarce assets
[00:32] is the name of the Fiat
[00:34] game you were the first guy that ever
[00:36] interviewed me and you're one of the
[00:39] first that like when I came up a little
[00:41] bit on Twitter that like uh prompted me
[00:43] on on a on an interview which was
[00:45] amazing uh for me to see this was one of
[00:47] the points where like oh it inspired me
[00:50] to do more and more and more so I'm
[00:52] really looking forward to the interview
[00:54] and talking with you today and this is
[00:56] basically how we came here today uh and
[01:00] question that I wanted to ask start you
[01:02] with with the question is how did this
[01:04] all start for you the SOS Journal like
[01:07] how why did you get motivated to to
[01:10] start something yeah thank you for the
[01:11] kind words and appreciate all your
[01:13] content and um you're doing great things
[01:15] with this podcast so keep it up and I
[01:17] believe you even wrote an article for us
[01:19] a while back and so uh I started as a
[01:22] toi Journal as a means to be able to
[01:25] have a medium by which all writers can
[01:28] write Bitcoin only cont content us
[01:31] whether it's their Bitcoin story or
[01:33] whether it's a technical Bitcoin article
[01:37] anything Bitcoin uh even if it's fantasy
[01:40] fictional non-fiction anything in that
[01:42] regard Bitcoin only we will publish and
[01:46] prior to satoshi's journal I was writing
[01:49] for Bitcoin magazine I wrote I think a
[01:51] little over eight articles for them and
[01:55] um the inspiration of Satoshi Journal
[01:57] actually came from my angst against
[02:00] being uh censored in a couple of my
[02:02] articles by Bitcoin magazine and um I I
[02:06] appreciate what Bitcoin Magazine's doing
[02:08] um I think they're they're doing great
[02:09] things there's some things I don't agree
[02:11] with and one of the biggest things I
[02:13] didn't agree with was the fact that c my
[02:15] articles were the way I submitted them
[02:18] they were returned back to me I didn't
[02:20] even recognize them and one of them just
[02:23] I was told it wasn't long enough it was
[02:25] like 550 words and it supposed to be a
[02:28] minimum of 600 and I was like what the
[02:30] hell so those two things really bothered
[02:32] me and um so I just said well I mean I
[02:37] can start
[02:38] something um similar I love writing
[02:41] that's my
[02:42] passion um and so I start TT journal and
[02:46] we focus on bitcoin Stories We love to
[02:49] get people's stories right now we have a
[02:52] bounty out for people's stories if they
[02:53] want to write a story you can write it
[02:55] and uh Poss possibly be rewarded 100,000
[02:59] sets
[03:01] um so we that's the other thing um no
[03:04] one gets paid as far as the people that
[03:07] AR on the payroll that Bitcoin magazine
[03:10] the people that submit articles to
[03:11] bitcoin magazine don't get paid and so I
[03:13] thought to myself this that's not good I
[03:15] mean why shouldn't you be incent be uh
[03:18] incentivized to write um or be paid and
[03:22] so we have that feature if you write for
[03:24] us you can get tipped for your article
[03:27] um for a while there I was giving
[03:28] Satoshi out for people's articles and it
[03:32] was good but um it's not a good business
[03:35] model so I started resorting to the tips
[03:37] deal and so it's basically proof of work
[03:39] if your article is good and it resonates
[03:41] with somebody then in your in your
[03:43] wallet you might have some tips
[03:46] um so I think I that's pretty much it as
[03:49] far as how Satoshi Journal was incepted
[03:51] and it's my passion to continue to write
[03:54] as much as possible and provide good
[03:55] content and also we do
[03:57] news and I I don't I we're not a big
[04:00] Media Company not not a big publication
[04:03] Company by any means but my goal was to
[04:06] just be raw uncensored unfiltered and
[04:11] just no different than than Bitcoin just
[04:13] have the Bitcoin ethos so I I try to
[04:15] post and repost things that are not
[04:19] necessarily posted by the big comp like
[04:22] um bitcoin news Bitcoin magazine all the
[04:25] big ones I'm trying to do things
[04:26] different and I focus on the plebs
[04:29] anything that's newsworthy from the pleb
[04:30] world and anything that's newsworthy in
[04:33] areas that aren't being covered by those
[04:35] big media companies I.E stories in
[04:38] Africa I have a lot of friends Bitcoin
[04:40] friends in Africa so I I know about
[04:42] what's happening in Africa more so than
[04:44] the big companies because I'm so Nimble
[04:47] that I can talk with people and and so
[04:50] if I find out that there's a a a Meetup
[04:53] in
[04:54] Zimbabwe or a Meetup in Malawi I repost
[04:58] it and that's that's my Niche I guess so
[05:02] that will be my answer there Robin I
[05:05] love it and I also love that you are um
[05:08] talking about censorship and this is
[05:10] something that uh keeps me up every day
[05:13] a little bit because it's like uh oh
[05:15] when when YouTube decides to to sensor
[05:17] me then my my whole living right now is
[05:20] kind of gone because most of it comes
[05:21] from from YouTube on the podcast and the
[05:23] podcast is mostly watched on YouTube um
[05:27] of course there's also the podcast
[05:28] platforms like Spotify and stuff like
[05:30] that but this is a little bit smaller
[05:32] for me uh then of course there's also
[05:34] Twitter but most people don't watch long
[05:37] form there how do you see the current
[05:39] state of of social media are you um is
[05:42] it now better than like 10 15 years when
[05:45] we only had the the the big media houses
[05:47] and now we at least have like platforms
[05:49] where we can put out stuff of course
[05:51] there is Shadow panning there's sensor
[05:53] ship uh but at least like there's a
[05:56] possibility and there's Nostra and and
[05:58] you can still like like have your own
[06:00] website and blog uh and you really have
[06:03] to do something completely wrong that
[06:05] they get off your domain and stuff like
[06:08] that like uh usually people don't get to
[06:11] that length um how do you see the
[06:13] current state of like censorship uh and
[06:16] like for example for for Bitcoin
[06:18] magazine for the magazine for me is like
[06:19] fair game because it's their magazine uh
[06:22] people can publish something like it's a
[06:24] private thing you can disagree agree but
[06:27] it's like their thing do do we have the
[06:30] the possibility right now with all the
[06:32] social medias going on with Noster going
[06:34] on do we actually have like free speech
[06:37] and and the possibility to say things or
[06:40] uh what would you
[06:42] improve yeah I think now more so than
[06:44] the past we do have the possibility to
[06:46] achieve what you just expressed um and
[06:50] the hard thing with today is we have too
[06:53] much um outlets and so you have to do
[06:57] more verification
[06:59] um I mean you you should always verify
[07:02] not trust but it's when you have so many
[07:07] media outlets and you don't know what to
[07:09] believe and then you compound that with
[07:13] AI it's going to be behoove us humans to
[07:16] just do even more verification of what
[07:19] we're reading before we repost or before
[07:22] we say oh this is the truth and and the
[07:25] thing that's good today that we didn't
[07:26] have before is the means by which we can
[07:29] for instance your podcast if you are on
[07:32] YouTube you can back it up on rumble or
[07:35] you can back it up on another platform
[07:37] that if YouTube decides to take you off
[07:39] at least you have another copy of your
[07:40] video and but interestingly enough like
[07:43] I remember Jason Lowry his Ted Talk I
[07:47] couldn't find it for the longest time on
[07:49] YouTube and it's a very good one and but
[07:51] I found it on on
[07:53] Rumble um and I think it came back on
[07:55] YouTube but I believe they took it off
[07:58] um but they take off a lot of
[08:00] people um so and then Noster is another
[08:04] thing that is just hasn't been popular
[08:06] made popular yet but if you want to
[08:08] basically have the means by which all
[08:10] your social media posts and activity
[08:14] cannot be censored then that's another
[08:15] medium
[08:17] so it just takes time for humans to
[08:21] research what means they have to be able
[08:24] to uh prevent censorship and to
[08:28] maximally use those means
[08:30] um quite honestly Robin I think
[08:33] bitcoiners are probably the most the
[08:37] people that care about their privacy and
[08:40] censorship resistance most than than
[08:43] anybody uh sad to say and I hate to
[08:45] generalize but I I think most people are
[08:48] just halfhazard with their um privacy
[08:53] and identity and all that um we've got
[08:56] to the point where when you download an
[08:58] app on your your your your cell phone
[09:02] there's a big page that comes up that
[09:04] says if you agree or disagree to the
[09:06] stipulations I mean you have to agree if
[09:09] you want to use the app I mean there's
[09:10] no and so because of that becoming so
[09:14] commonplace and just clicking agree
[09:16] we've lost almost all of our privacy
[09:20] when it's all said and done um so we
[09:22] have to keep we have to protect the
[09:25] lasts the last whisps wisps of privacy
[09:28] that we still have
[09:30] um and at least we do now have the means
[09:33] by which we can do that with certain
[09:35] things like I've already said Rumble and
[09:37] Noster so that would be my answer
[09:40] to are you afraid that we have at some
[09:43] point uh privacy just just not there yet
[09:46] because people uh I hear it so many
[09:49] times from from like my mom for example
[09:52] who's like oh I don't have anything to
[09:53] hide and I'm like yes but you still
[09:56] should not share everything and you
[09:58] still should care about your privacy uh
[10:01] but I feel like more and more people
[10:03] especially the younger folks that are
[10:06] sharing everything and then we have the
[10:08] the thing where we like and we talked
[10:10] about that in the in the last episode
[10:11] also uh when you are in a public place
[10:14] you're going through a city it's like
[10:16] maybe Vienna brague a big city you're
[10:18] going through there every day and there
[10:21] are tourists taking pictures of on how
[10:23] many smartphones are you on the uh on
[10:26] the camera rooll because someone clicked
[10:28] a picture of some something and you are
[10:30] on there then everything is backed up to
[10:32] the iCloud and the iCloud has AI
[10:34] programs running over them like you are
[10:37] maintained by by a lot of systems um do
[10:41] do we have privacy at this point uh and
[10:44] I mean sorry Robin
[10:47] I I believe that the last privacy we
[10:52] have is
[10:53] Bitcoin I think and people disagree with
[10:56] me on this a lot of bitcoiners
[10:59] my
[11:00] father-in-law but what was proof in the
[11:02] pudding for me was this you just got to
[11:04] ask yourself who has your social
[11:06] security number or whatever number your
[11:09] local jurisdiction has they they already
[11:12] know everything about you with your
[11:13] social security number who who has your
[11:15] driver's license the state the
[11:17] government they already know everything
[11:19] about you when you get a job what do you
[11:21] have to give them all your private
[11:22] information when you have a bank what do
[11:24] you have to give them all your private
[11:25] information there is not one
[11:27] person except for I guess Satoshi
[11:30] Nakamoto and some other um Cipher punks
[11:33] um shadowy super quarters that truly are
[11:36] Anonymous on Earth because you can't be
[11:38] um unless you're a little hermit in the
[11:40] undisclosed little Mountaintop hiding in
[11:43] a tree Bitcoin is I think the last stand
[11:47] for privacy thus the reason that I I'm
[11:50] very thankful there's smarter people
[11:51] than I working on trying to get Bitcoin
[11:54] to be more private um and I and I say
[11:57] private private private there's nothing
[12:00] private about Bitcoin because it's an
[12:02] open Ledger but what I mean is at a
[12:05] minimum one should be trying to manage
[12:08] their utxo set basically Bitcoin is a
[12:13] utxo unspent transactional output
[12:16] instead of basically having all your
[12:19] Bitcoin in one
[12:21] utxo the closest thing to keeping that
[12:24] Bitcoin private and and and and someone
[12:27] not being able to look at the blockch
[12:29] chain and say oh this is Jeremy or this
[12:30] is Robin is to have all your utxos
[12:34] managed and divvied up and that's
[12:36] something that I wish I would have done
[12:38] a better job when I started um so I kind
[12:42] of think oh and so what really made me
[12:44] outside of about what I just said when I
[12:47] learned about the the dark web which is
[12:50] tour um the dark web gets a lot of bad R
[12:53] but the dark web essentially is was
[12:56] developed by the
[12:57] Navy as a means to provide their
[13:00] employees a way to whistleblow
[13:02] anonymously that was the how the dark
[13:04] web was incepted t uh foret something
[13:08] onion router the dark web was created
[13:10] for that but guess who got a hold of
[13:12] it criminals and what do criminals do
[13:15] with a tool that was meant to be
[13:16] something that was just going to allow
[13:18] someone to retain an anonymity um if
[13:20] they were a whistable they're going to
[13:22] use it for criminal acts and that's what
[13:25] that's why the dark web gets so much uh
[13:27] flak the dark web has a lot of bad stuff
[13:29] that happens on it but the dark web
[13:31] allows someone in China or India where
[13:33] they have their internet firewall to be
[13:36] able to talk with people that are in
[13:38] another country they didn't have the
[13:40] dark web the tour they won't be able to
[13:42] do that so and then I learned more about
[13:46] it I mean on tour you literally you can
[13:49] go on there just like eBay and buy
[13:50] people's identity you can find their
[13:52] driver's license you can find I I
[13:54] truthed all this because when I found
[13:55] out about it I didn't believe it I
[13:56] didn't believe you can buy drugs and
[13:58] guns and
[14:00] uh identities I was like n that's a
[14:01] bunch of crap so before I did any of it
[14:03] of course you're scared to do it went on
[14:05] YouTube and I searched how to do it and
[14:09] lo and behold indeed you can find
[14:12] people's identity just and you can bid
[14:14] on it this is
[14:16] nothing crazy it's maybe taboo to talk
[14:19] about but you now know that the dark web
[14:22] was created for something that was good
[14:25] and they used it for bad um we had the
[14:27] silap road one knows about the Silk Road
[14:31] as soon as the FBI shut down Silk Road
[14:33] guess what happened I think within weeks
[14:35] Silk Road 2 came up that showed you that
[14:38] the FBI didn't have any control over the
[14:41] dark web that's why they hate it that's
[14:43] why the government doesn't want Bitcoin
[14:45] you can't control what is uncontrollable
[14:49] and uh Bitcoin is not controllable and
[14:51] that's why that's why it's a very
[14:52] powerful thing but it's important that
[14:55] because Bitcoin is such a transparent
[14:59] open Ledger that you at least at a
[15:01] minimum especially now that we're going
[15:03] through these crazy privacy uh issues
[15:06] and um the government cracking down on
[15:09] people when you buy your Bitcoin and
[15:12] when you store
[15:13] it um there's rules of thumb that you
[15:16] have a uh a utxo that's utxo set that's
[15:20] no more than a million
[15:23] STS so when you're managing your utx so
[15:27] set if you have 10 million SATs
[15:29] the the ideal way to store those sets is
[15:32] to have 10 1 million utxo sets and and
[15:37] this was something that was just
[15:39] recommended um by one of our friends on
[15:42] Twitter Wicked he's he's well-known
[15:44] gentleman um does some awesome graphical
[15:47] work and and security work and Bitcoin
[15:50] work and and it's instead of having one
[15:54] 10 million utx so set and and then and
[15:57] having 10 one U million utxo sets that
[16:00] means that the likelihood of the
[16:03] government or somebody that wants to
[16:05] find you finding you with 10 utxo sets
[16:09] and getting those back to you it's it's
[16:13] we's just say 10 times harder whereas if
[16:15] you have one utxo 10 million utxos they
[16:19] can say oh this one person has this one
[16:22] big utx oet additionally those utx oets
[16:26] should be associated with one Bitcoin
[16:28] wallet
[16:29] sorry with multiple Bitcoin wallets so
[16:31] that's why they always preach in the
[16:33] Bitcoin world that when you buy your
[16:36] Bitcoin and you transfer it to a wallet
[16:38] you always create a new wallet address
[16:41] so those things are hand inand for you
[16:43] to be able to retain privacy on an open
[16:47] ler that everyone can see and then you
[16:49] go to the notion of how how secretive do
[16:53] you want to be I mean what do you have
[16:55] to hide and like what your mom said my
[16:59] father-in-law said the same thing um I
[17:02] mean in one
[17:04] respect what do you have the ni I mean I
[17:07] mean if it comes down to this if you
[17:11] have a lot of Bitcoin and you don't want
[17:14] to be found out for how much Bitcoin you
[17:16] have for whatever reason then manage
[17:19] your
[17:20] utxos and use a different wallet address
[17:23] every time you make a
[17:25] transaction and I'm very positive that
[17:28] there's
[17:29] very very very tiniest fraction amount
[17:31] of the world in Bitcoin that even does
[17:34] that I think it would be the Maxi of the
[17:36] Maxi that do it so I don't know what a
[17:39] percentage that'd be but when it's all
[17:41] said and done Robin I think the vast
[17:43] majority of people are going to use
[17:45] Bitcoin in the least private way
[17:48] possible by not doing what I just said
[17:50] so that goes back to your question I
[17:53] mean is there any privacy there's not
[17:56] much I mean I don't know how much but
[17:59] there's not much the government knows
[18:00] everything about you so unless like I
[18:02] said you're a shadowy super quarter
[18:04] tooshi Nakamoto or hermit in the hill uh
[18:08] your so so even even the Maxis that are
[18:12] shadowy super Quarters on on Twitter in
[18:15] their in their local jurisdiction they
[18:17] they're known by the government and we
[18:19] lost majority of of our
[18:22] privacy in 200 was it
[18:26] 2009 September 2011 those Towers were
[18:30] taken down what happened thereafter was
[18:33] um the government
[18:38] instituted it was a
[18:41] program that allowed them to basically
[18:44] get all of our information that they
[18:46] didn't already have um I'm sorry I'm
[18:49] something came out of the
[18:51] 911 um terrorist
[18:54] attacks that allowed them to even get
[18:57] more information and then they're still
[18:59] going to try to get more information so
[19:00] they're already trying to do it with
[19:01] Bitcoin they're trying to censor Bitcoin
[19:04] in every way possible they're making
[19:07] bitcoiners scared bitcoiners in America
[19:09] anyway they're moving to other countries
[19:11] they see the writing on the wall and um
[19:15] that's a long run out question and
[19:16] answer so sorry but that would be my
[19:19] answer I guess Robin and I have for
[19:21] everyone uh because wicked as you
[19:24] mentioned him we actually had two or
[19:27] three weeks ago a show with him on this
[19:29] podcast uh and we went in this topic
[19:31] Utes o management really deep so for
[19:34] everybody that's really like interested
[19:37] uh maybe I think of and Link it in the
[19:39] video but I might forget it so like just
[19:42] go on my channel and and search vicet uh
[19:44] or utxo management it's the only one
[19:46] with utxo management that I did and he
[19:48] did a really great job uh in explaining
[19:52] the balancing between privacy and
[19:55] avoiding dust because the other aspect
[19:57] of uto management if you have a lot of
[19:59] small UT exos and the fees are getting
[20:02] really high in like 10 20 years and you
[20:03] did not consolidate them um is they um
[20:08] they might be unspin uh because the fees
[20:11] are higher than the actual Bitcoin stack
[20:13] so there's this privacy aspect to it and
[20:15] there's this dust aspect to it and he
[20:18] did an amazing job in like one hour or
[20:20] something to explain what's going on
[20:22] what you can do what tools to use and
[20:24] stuff like that so uh for everyone I
[20:26] recommend watching this to the end and
[20:28] then going to the UT so uh
[20:31] thing yeah and he he's the one that
[20:33] caused me to I had the intent to move
[20:36] from my ledger wallet to a cold card
[20:40] but he's the one that taught me how to
[20:43] do that with his amazing
[20:45] tutorial and also he helped me with my
[20:49] utxo management because of his videos I
[20:51] highly recommend that everyone watches
[20:53] all his videos because he's very
[20:55] technical they're very long videos
[20:57] because they're very
[20:59] uh detailed and he goes step by step by
[21:02] step so I have utmost respect for that
[21:04] gentleman I've got to meet him he's an
[21:06] amazing individual and um I just I can't
[21:10] tell people enough please go to his
[21:12] videos manage your utxos
[21:15] appropriately and also if you have a
[21:18] ledger transfer from ledger to cold
[21:21] wallet or cold card sorry whatever
[21:23] wallet outside of Ledger because Ledger
[21:25] is not a good deal um so yeah thank you
[21:28] for telling me about your interview I
[21:30] think I had remember uh reading about it
[21:33] as far as you I think announcing it and
[21:35] I think I even retweeted your tweet I
[21:37] think it was him actually yeah VI did a
[21:40] great job and it was well received I got
[21:44] uh two kinds of comments like the first
[21:46] one was great that you talk about it and
[21:48] great that I finally understand it and
[21:50] take it serious and the other was like
[21:52] it was too technical so I feel like I I
[21:55] have to do a second one where I like
[21:56] even step out even little bit more uh
[22:00] but I feel like that's that's an
[22:01] actually a good thing and I got also
[22:03] like the comment uh that someone like
[22:05] watched it two times and the second time
[22:07] they actually understood it uh because
[22:09] it's just a it's not an easy topic if
[22:12] you never thought of that like it's
[22:13] Bitcoin itself is something completely
[22:16] new and we can after that talk about the
[22:18] Bitcoin Revolution and how it's
[22:20] generational wealth but it's it's it's a
[22:22] diff difficult uh topic and then the
[22:25] technical stuff on top of that yeah what
[22:27] would you the easiest way for me to
[22:29] understand utxos and the management
[22:32] thereof was how another person his name
[22:35] is TC everyone knows him on Twitter if
[22:36] you don't follow him follow him uh
[22:39] meditation man I think is his his
[22:42] Twitter handook when you have a wallet
[22:45] just a wallet uh physical one with
[22:48] dollars you have dollars you have $5
[22:51] bills you have $10 bills you have a $100
[22:53] bills your utxo set in Bitcoin is no
[22:56] different in that if you have Mr just
[22:58] say one Satoshi is a dollar bill and
[23:01] five Satoshi is a $5 bill and 10 Satoshi
[23:04] is $10 bill so on and so forth if you
[23:07] were to think about it the same way do
[23:09] you want to carry a wallet full of $100
[23:11] bills or do you want to carry a wallet
[23:14] that's a mix of one 10 fives 20s and
[23:18] hundreds when I was explained to me that
[23:20] way I then understood the value of
[23:23] having um smaller utx
[23:27] oets but not like a million utx not like
[23:30] 100 million
[23:33] utxos 100 million like like a billion
[23:36] utxos uh having smaller utxos I.E 1
[23:41] million utxo sets sub sets with separate
[23:46] wall addresses for each
[23:48] one prepares one for the future when
[23:52] someone looks at all the open Ledger of
[23:54] B of Bitcoin and says oh cool there's
[23:57] all these small little transactions
[24:00] there's this huge transaction let's look
[24:02] at that one oh there's this even bigger
[24:04] transaction let's look at that one
[24:05] they're less likely to look at those
[24:07] little small ones and even if they do
[24:09] look at them if you have a bunch of
[24:11] small ones you have clouded your
[24:15] transactional identity by doing that so
[24:18] I just wanted to share that because
[24:19] that's how I was able to like in my
[24:20] little farm brain down on the farm like
[24:23] that's how I say it down on the farm
[24:24] that's how I understood it
[24:27] better h
[24:29] amazing and um it's really important to
[24:31] to take utxo management seriously and
[24:34] and I say that because no bitcoiners
[24:38] aren't because of personal experience I
[24:42] took uh uo management series just last
[24:46] year end of last year and I was already
[24:48] three years in Bitcoin I was already two
[24:51] years all in in Bitcoin uh I was already
[24:54] on Twitter actively uh tweeting about it
[24:56] and screaming about it I was uh really
[24:59] active in the community and I was still
[25:01] not doing it so uh it's it it's
[25:05] something that um first only people that
[25:09] were concerned with the Privacy did now
[25:11] a little bit more people do it because
[25:13] the fee debate is coming up and the dust
[25:16] debate is coming up uh this was not a
[25:19] like five years ago six seven years ago
[25:22] this was just not a not a thing that
[25:24] bitcoiners were concerned about but
[25:25] slowly slowly the concern comes up uh
[25:28] and it's a Val concern so we have to
[25:31] take it seriously it's it's we are early
[25:34] adopters uh and we have to do extra work
[25:37] like when you come in Bitcoin in 20
[25:39] years there are probably really great
[25:42] solutions for that you probably know
[25:44] about it or there's some technical thing
[25:46] uh that makes it easier or it's like
[25:48] well known that there in 20 years it
[25:50] will be less of a problem because so
[25:53] many people already went through that
[25:55] hoop and all so many like people tested
[25:57] everything but we are still in a really
[26:00] early stage uh which kind of brings me
[26:03] even to my next question what do you
[26:05] think is like the current state of Game
[26:08] Theory when we see when we look at
[26:10] Bitcoin um and where we see where where
[26:13] where we are I'm a little bit confused
[26:16] with are we in the stage where they
[26:19] still laugh at us are we in the stage
[26:21] where they keep fighting us the ETF kind
[26:25] is like are they joining us even I like
[26:29] with that I'm like uh a little bit of
[26:31] all of the worlds because it's like e
[26:34] they're joining us but then I hear Jamie
[26:35] Diamond Elizabeth War talking about oh
[26:37] they're fighting us uh yeah it's like it
[26:40] feels like there's there's a lot going
[26:42] on do you have like uh BL where like
[26:46] where are
[26:47] we okay yeah so I'm going to give it
[26:49] down on the farm analogy I have a farm I
[26:51] have miniature goats and
[26:53] donkeys my donkeys in the summer they
[26:57] get a lot of flies around on them and
[26:59] when there's too many flies they start
[27:02] hitting their face with their their tail
[27:07] and when there's even more flies they
[27:09] start sometimes they see them running
[27:11] around trying to get rid of them or they
[27:14] start rolling around in the dust the
[27:15] analogy is this um a donkey is a big
[27:19] animal and a fly is a little little Pest
[27:22] and I think we're at the point from a
[27:24] game theory standpoint of the Donkey is
[27:28] just hitting us with hitting the Flies
[27:32] the
[27:33] Bitcoin with his
[27:35] tail um yes they're fighting us but that
[27:39] remember that little
[27:41] fly
[27:42] that's pestering my donkey the donkey
[27:46] doesn't like it because the the little
[27:47] fly is going over there and getting on
[27:49] his eyes and his mouth this and the
[27:50] other so he just simply just gets his
[27:52] all day you'll see his little Tail Going
[27:55] slap the flies like he'll do it all day
[27:59] and and it's interesting because I have
[28:02] two donkeys and if you anyone that has a
[28:04] farm will understand this analogy
[28:06] donkeys or horses they'll they'll stand
[28:09] next to each other in such a manner
[28:11] where the butt end of one donkey is at
[28:14] the face of the other donkey so they
[28:16] help each other SW uh hit flies that's
[28:21] kind of what's Happening Now is multiple
[28:23] government
[28:24] entities are asked to ask or sorry asked
[28:27] to head the Flies are hitting them the
[28:30] Bitcoin and the privacy and the fact
[28:35] that we can send money across the world
[28:37] with no one being able to do anything
[28:39] about it they don't like that and the
[28:41] energy aspect they're just little at
[28:43] this point the Flies are just bothering
[28:46] the government in their mouth in their
[28:48] head and and their eyes and their and
[28:50] they're just different entities are just
[28:52] flicking their little tail to take the
[28:55] flies out the donkeys have not
[28:59] started running to get rid of the Flies
[29:02] the donkeys have not started rolling
[29:03] around in the dust to get rid of the
[29:05] Flies so I don't think they get to the
[29:07] point where they're truly fighting us
[29:09] that war has just begun and it's only
[29:11] going to get worse and I also think that
[29:14] the government truly does not understand
[29:17] the implications of what we
[29:20] have in
[29:22] our
[29:24] grasps a lot of people say government
[29:26] people are stupid I work for the
[29:28] government for over 15 years and there
[29:29] is a lot of stupid people but that
[29:31] they're smart enough to know that
[29:33] something's arai and there something's
[29:36] starting to get their
[29:38] power my opinion Robin and I work in a
[29:43] place where we focus on
[29:45] energy the thing that's going to upend
[29:48] and be the true children horse of
[29:50] Bitcoin is the energy aspect even in the
[29:53] energy sector where I
[29:56] work and the government
[29:58] people still don't have a clue about
[30:00] Bitcoin they they prer to it as
[30:03] cryptocurrency generally they they they
[30:05] do not understand the huge energy
[30:09] implications of Bitcoin and that's
[30:11] actually what interests me more than
[30:12] anything in Bitcoin after I learned
[30:15] because energy equals MC s energy is
[30:21] everything yes the monetary aspects of
[30:23] Bitcoin are great but the energy aspects
[30:27] in my opinion is greater and that's
[30:29] what's going to catch all the PE all the
[30:32] politicians and the rural Powers by
[30:35] surprise when going to your game theory
[30:39] question when xon mobile announces
[30:43] finally that they're mining Bitcoin
[30:44] which they already
[30:45] are and when I forget it was I think it
[30:48] was sha or kico or someone one of those
[30:52] companies they sponsored Bitcoin
[30:55] Magazine's last conference when the
[30:57] Energy company
[30:59] because energy runs the whole world when
[31:01] the first one announces that they're
[31:03] going on a mass scale and Mining Bitcoin
[31:05] they haven't been announcing it in my
[31:07] opinion because gives the other
[31:08] companies a competitive Advantage but it
[31:10] is happening and it's because the
[31:13] incentive of Bitcoin is such that the
[31:16] EPA will not shut down these oil
[31:18] fields as long as they're not emitting
[31:20] too much methane um and if they arting
[31:24] too much methan they have to shut off
[31:28] and if you put a Bitcoin miner next to
[31:31] your oil field each of your oil rigs you
[31:35] don't ever have to shut off to making
[31:36] money Bitcoin and oil it just doesn't
[31:39] make sense why no Energy company would
[31:41] be not be mining Bitcoin because they
[31:44] all have to give off wasted gas whether
[31:47] it's methane natural gas um any other
[31:51] form of gas that they hit whenever
[31:52] they're mining or drilling so I think
[31:56] that's a huge aspect of Game
[31:59] Theory energy I think is going to be the
[32:03] main thing that pushes the Trojan Horse
[32:05] into the Citadel of the government and
[32:08] they're just going to have to grasp it
[32:10] and the beneficiaries of that are going
[32:11] to be the people in many many different
[32:14] forms the game theory it's funny because
[32:17] it's happening now because of number go
[32:18] up and it's always been number go up the
[32:21] genius of the protocol supply and demand
[32:25] I've always equivocated it to a bug
[32:29] the bugs go to the B the blue
[32:31] light because they're attracted to it
[32:34] when the price is up the blue light
[32:35] turns on and they go to it and when they
[32:37] get to the blue light what happens they
[32:39] get zapped they die when the blue
[32:42] light's off the price is going down the
[32:44] bugs don't go right now the the blue
[32:47] light is on the Bitcoin price is getting
[32:50] higher and the bugs are going after it
[32:52] the ETFs Morgan
[32:54] Stanley Bank of America uh W Fargo I
[32:58] think Bank of America yep um this is
[33:01] huge man this is bigger than most people
[33:03] are thinking I remember going to a bank
[33:05] in my local area and I asked them do you
[33:08] guys are you guys contemplating um
[33:11] offering selling Bitcoin here and they
[33:13] just laugh at me W Fargo I believe is
[33:16] the third largest bank and they're
[33:19] basically buying Bitcoin um and so the
[33:24] the little bugs are going to the blue
[33:25] light the price of Bitcoin that's going
[33:28] up and there's going to be more bugs and
[33:30] bigger bugs and but as soon as that
[33:33] light goes off soon as the Bitcoin price
[33:35] reaches its next all-time
[33:37] high there's no more bugs so then it's
[33:41] just another long bare cycle and it
[33:44] continues so it's a beautiful protocol
[33:46] on how it was designed but it's the
[33:49] greed of man that's feeding Bitcoin and
[33:55] and I hate to say it that way but
[33:56] someone and I think you I think he was
[33:58] an Eco was simply Bitcoin he said
[34:01] Bitcoin
[34:03] um Reigns in the greed of man or
[34:07] something he put it much better than
[34:10] I but right now the greed of man is not
[34:13] rained in because anyone can print the
[34:15] government can print as much fiat
[34:17] currency as they
[34:18] want um oh that's what it was Bitcoin
[34:23] domesticates human
[34:26] greed and it was a very powerful
[34:28] statement when I heard it um there is no
[34:31] domestication of our Fiat monetary
[34:33] system it's it's it's always been ruled
[34:36] by the powerful and they will continue
[34:39] to have all the power the rich get
[34:40] richer the poor get poor until we have a
[34:44] money that's an equal playing field for
[34:45] everybody so I Love Game Theory I've
[34:48] written two articles on it and no one
[34:50] knows the final outcome one thing I will
[34:53] I should have started off with this but
[34:55] Game Theory can be defined simply as
[34:56] this if if you're playing a game any
[34:59] game but in this case we'll say a game
[35:01] of of
[35:02] Chess when I moved my little Pawn
[35:05] forward and Robin you decide to move
[35:07] your Bishop the other
[35:10] way you are making moves to counteract
[35:14] me and vice versa with the ultimate
[35:16] outcome of I need to have better moves
[35:20] so as to Checkmate you and win the
[35:23] beauty about Bitcoin is it's not pling
[35:27] it's not even it's in the game but it's
[35:29] not in the game it's all the players the
[35:32] banks the ETFs they're the ones that are
[35:35] playing in the game and it's almost like
[35:37] Bitcoin just watching play its
[35:40] game
[35:42] so in but in a nutshell Bitcoin will
[35:44] Checkmate and in my opinion there's no
[35:47] stalemate there's no option for a
[35:49] stalemate and in the game of chess if
[35:51] two players get to a point in the game
[35:52] where that no one can move at the
[35:54] stalemate in the game of chess that
[35:56] bitcoin's playing with the world there's
[35:58] going to be a Checkmate uh that's my
[36:00] opinion on it in the game of chess there
[36:02] are 1 time 10 to the 18 possible moves
[36:05] um that's a lot 1 time 10 to the 12 is 1
[36:07] trillion 1 time 10 to the 40 what I
[36:11] think I said 1 time 10 to the 42 sorry I
[36:13] misspoke I think it's 11 10 to the 42 is
[36:16] how many moves that are possible in the
[36:18] game of chess in the game of chess that
[36:21] Bitcoin is playing because it would be
[36:22] considered 3D 4D 5D chess no one knows
[36:26] how many like moves and that's what
[36:30] makes I can write an infinite amount of
[36:33] of of articles on Game Theory and never
[36:36] run out Infinity so that's why I love
[36:40] bitcoin's game theory is because it just
[36:42] keeps you guessing so all I say is just
[36:45] get your popcorn and your Coke and watch
[36:48] it because it's fun and it's amazing and
[36:50] it's beautiful and and we're seeing a
[36:52] money basically monetized before our
[36:55] very eyes no one got to see the
[36:57] monetization of gold over 2,000 years
[37:00] ago no one got to see when gold was at a
[37:02] penny or a dollar or 100 no
[37:05] one and we're seeing Bitcoin monetized
[37:08] over the last 15 years that that's a
[37:10] beautiful thing no one that's why we're
[37:12] very lucky to live in this time we're
[37:14] actually getting to see a money go from
[37:17] being a baby to being 15 years old and
[37:20] and it's it's you would think it's a
[37:22] teen if you are listening to this
[37:24] podcast you might be wondering what is
[37:26] actually the setup look like of Robin or
[37:28] how can I improve my Bitcoin setup and
[37:31] there's two things you have to buy
[37:33] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[37:34] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[37:36] let's focus on the first thing how to
[37:38] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[37:41] only exchange don't deal with the
[37:43] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[37:45] exchange that has an own token or
[37:47] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[37:49] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[37:52] for me the best partner for that and now
[37:56] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[37:57] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[38:00] a self custody solution where you
[38:03] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[38:06] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[38:09] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[38:12] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[38:14] phas and you are better than 95% of all
[38:18] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than a
[38:20] th000 Euros in Bitcoin it's an
[38:22] absolutely must have one last thing
[38:25] before we get back to the video I'm
[38:26] really about meeting other bitcoiners
[38:29] and there's an amazing opportunity in
[38:31] middle of Europe in June the Bitcoin BR
[38:35] conference it's the best and biggest
[38:38] Bitcoin only conference in whole of
[38:40] Europe for all Americans please visit
[38:43] Europe and visit this place in June for
[38:45] all europees it's a must go anyways you
[38:48] are so close to the Bitcoin Pride
[38:50] conference you basically have to come I
[38:52] will do interviews there and I would
[38:54] love to meet you all there use code in
[38:57] for all my sponsors to get discounts and
[39:00] use the links down in the description
[39:02] that's uh that was amazing and when we
[39:05] think of Game Theory and when you think
[39:07] of the the bigger Revolution that's
[39:10] going on with with
[39:11] Bitcoin I find it amazing that it's the
[39:14] first Revolution that we ever had that
[39:16] when you are participating now in the
[39:19] revolution against the current system
[39:22] which we had a lot of times in history
[39:24] but it's the first time ever where
[39:26] you're actually gaining Financial power
[39:28] where you actually are gaining um
[39:31] resources from that usually when you
[39:34] have uh Revolution you're standing up
[39:37] against the system you have to suffer a
[39:39] lot you have to uh pay a lot to
[39:42] participate in the revolution you also
[39:44] have to pay participate in this
[39:47] revolution but it pays off over time if
[39:49] you're long-term in the Bitcoin uh
[39:51] you're actually gaining resources you're
[39:53] actually gaining uh Financial uh
[39:55] Financial stability and you gaining even
[39:58] Freedom rights not only at the end of
[40:01] the fight usually like Freedom
[40:03] revolutions Revolution is in in the end
[40:05] of the game then then all of the sudden
[40:08] you're gaining it but even before uh
[40:12] Bitcoin checkmates the system when you
[40:14] are participating in that uh Revolution
[40:17] you are getting uh more free and more
[40:21] powerful and more resourceful with time
[40:25] and that's an an an an really
[40:27] interesting and Powerful thought uh that
[40:30] that Bitcoin enables you and which also
[40:32] leads me to my my next question um is is
[40:36] Bitcoin completely changing retirement
[40:39] planning I feel like when when I think
[40:41] of my retirement it's like yeah I have
[40:43] Bitcoin I I I don't care for anything
[40:45] else uh my my parents other people even
[40:49] from from my generation they're like oh
[40:51] yeah have this uh in America that like
[40:53] 401ks I'm not America we have like
[40:55] pension systems you have to pin you have
[40:58] private insurance like there are so many
[40:59] different things you can do and I'm like
[41:02] yes I have
[41:03] Bitcoin that that's my that's my
[41:06] retirement
[41:08] plan yeah to answer your question short
[41:10] yes Bitcoin is changing retirement as we
[41:13] know it and I want to kill a lot of
[41:15] sacred cows with what I'm about to say
[41:18] and a lot of those cows are actually
[41:19] killed by a book that I highly recommend
[41:21] that's called killing sacred cows now
[41:24] there's other lot of books that I read
[41:26] that have killed the sacred cows of
[41:28] retirement planning financial planning
[41:30] as as we know it I'm going to go through
[41:33] them as fast as possible
[41:34] but you are the best person to manage
[41:37] your money uh unbeknownst to yourself
[41:40] maybe just in general I'm not talking to
[41:42] you just in
[41:44] general and the reason is because you
[41:46] care most about your
[41:48] money but the vast majority of people
[41:51] give their money to a financial planner
[41:53] that financial planner is supposed to
[41:55] care there's supposed to be a financial
[41:57] fiduciary that's what their name is but
[42:00] there's also an incentive that they
[42:02] basically value a product of which they
[42:06] get a kickback so it's
[42:09] skewed that the financial
[42:12] fiduciary is incentivized to be a
[42:15] steward of your money but they're making
[42:18] money off of it I went down this Rabbit
[42:20] Hole a long time ago to find
[42:22] out and I I interviewed financial
[42:25] planners just to see what they do for
[42:28] for me for my dad my mom and it's so
[42:32] easy a monkey could do it that's what I
[42:34] come down to it um and it's even easier
[42:37] now with Bitcoin and the reason why it's
[42:40] so easy with Bitcoin is sometimes the
[42:42] easiest thing is the hardest thing to do
[42:44] I don't
[42:45] understand and and there's
[42:47] some means to be able to understand this
[42:50] but if I were to tell you just to Simply
[42:53] buy Bitcoin and save and that will get
[42:55] you to early retirement for
[42:58] anything you're not going to believe me
[43:00] I mean not you but just people in
[43:02] general but that's how easy it is like I
[43:06] mean just save and hold it forever
[43:12] that's
[43:13] it the the the the financial world is
[43:16] much like our Fiat monetary system it's
[43:19] so convoluted
[43:21] with craziness and um monikers that
[43:25] people don't understand ver like
[43:28] monikers or words or they they try to
[43:31] make the game sound much more
[43:34] complicated than it is purposely so that
[43:38] you don't know how to play the game but
[43:39] the game is so simple the game has
[43:42] always been before Bitcoin to acrw
[43:46] scarce assets real estate gold silver
[43:50] water rights animals tractor um but if
[43:55] if you play the game of monop
[43:58] I know how many people realize this the
[43:59] game of Monopoly is the game that you're
[44:02] currently playing in your real life
[44:04] right now in the game of Monopoly the
[44:07] strategy it blatantly says in there is
[44:10] that you acrew all the assets and
[44:12] bankrupt all the other players and guess
[44:15] what in the game of Monopoly the bank
[44:17] per the rule set can create more
[44:20] Monopoly money if the bank runs out of
[44:23] Monopoly money and it blatantly says
[44:26] that when it gets to the point when they
[44:27] run out of Monopoly money in the game
[44:29] you can get a piece of
[44:31] paper and write new money on it that is
[44:35] no different than the game that you're
[44:37] playing now so if you can win the game
[44:39] of Monopoly that you play with your
[44:40] family at Thanksgiving or
[44:42] Christmas you can win the game that was
[44:46] before Bitcoin that's how you win the
[44:49] game that's how you retired early that's
[44:51] how you attain Financial Freedom is know
[44:54] how to play the game of Monopoly and a
[44:56] crew all the assets and screw everyone
[44:59] else they're going to go
[45:01] bankrupt if you don't believe me people
[45:04] listening play the game of Monopoly and
[45:06] then start thinking about your life
[45:08] start thinking why are the rich getting
[45:09] richer and the poor getting
[45:11] poorer it's because of the game of
[45:13] Monopoly you might think that you're
[45:16] playing that game and you're having a
[45:17] good time with your family and yeah you
[45:19] won I you have all the whole towels you
[45:21] have all the houses you're getting all
[45:22] the rental income you own all the best
[45:24] properties and your family members who
[45:27] are also having a good time with you
[45:29] they don't win the game because they
[45:30] don't have what you have in the game of
[45:33] Monopoly that game is exactly the game
[45:36] you're
[45:37] playing and it's for this reason that
[45:39] I'm trying to do satosi Journal because
[45:41] we do we do about Bitcoin education
[45:44] products we have a card game um and a
[45:47] children's book right now I'm reverse
[45:50] engineering the game of Monopoly so that
[45:52] we can play the game in such a manner
[45:53] where the strategy is not to acrw all
[45:55] the asset the strategy is to ACW as much
[45:58] Bitcoin as possible there's the notion
[46:00] of saving is no longer in our vocabulary
[46:04] anywhere in the world and it's because
[46:06] all currencies in the world are debasing
[46:08] faster than you can save why would you
[46:10] save and the people that understand that
[46:12] better than Americans or Africans
[46:14] argentinians
[46:15] Tuan the US is still very dumb and I say
[46:20] that with all due respect but whenever
[46:21] your inflation rate is not 20 or
[46:24] 30% and it's maybe 10 or 20% I mean I
[46:29] know it's higher than 10% uh in real
[46:32] terms but everyone thinks is 2%
[46:36] [Music]
[46:37] so retirement and Financial Freedom are
[46:41] as easy as just saving in Bitcoin and
[46:43] holding it and never selling it now to
[46:46] go further into the retire actually I'll
[46:47] stop there and then I can go further but
[46:51] how let you go yeah it's it's really
[46:54] interesting for me because when you
[46:56] think about
[46:57] Bitcoin the most effective um strategy
[47:02] is just getting it and holding it as you
[47:06] mentioned but that's the hardest thing
[47:08] to do for people because they always
[47:10] want to do stuff they they don't want to
[47:12] leave it they they they like oh but what
[47:15] do I do what do like yes set it up
[47:18] nicely get a nice cold storage self cast
[47:21] solution um learn how to do it h try to
[47:25] like uh do
[47:27] uh health checks every now and then from
[47:29] your self- custody solution like really
[47:32] dig deep you need a lot of set uping
[47:35] time but once you got everything set up
[47:38] everything is perfect in your solution
[47:40] you know where to buy you know how to
[47:42] store it you know everything then you
[47:45] just have to create value for other
[47:48] human beings so in order for you to get
[47:51] rewarded in Bitcoin and then you can
[47:54] store the Bitcoin in your uh self cast a
[47:57] solution and uh like you can pay a bill
[48:01] and what you don't need you can put in
[48:04] in your Bitcoin savings account that's
[48:06] it do that for the next 10 years and you
[48:09] will be a very very wealthy uh man or
[48:12] woman uh because uh Bitcoin will acre
[48:16] even if you're just saving 50 or $100
[48:19] every month it will agre a lot of wealth
[48:23] because we are so early in the game it's
[48:25] not only that bit coin itself even if
[48:27] it's at full adoption it grows value
[48:30] over time but we also having the
[48:33] adoption coming in like the sound money
[48:35] properties uh uh make it go up in in in
[48:39] purchasing power but then we also have
[48:42] the uh adoption uh uh Factor coming in
[48:45] and that's it's it's fascinating to see
[48:48] uh that that game theory and that
[48:50] Revolution playing out and uh yeah it's
[48:52] Bitcoin is an an fascinating savings
[48:54] device but people have to get that they
[48:57] don't have to manage an ETF they don't
[49:00] have to pick stocks they they don't have
[49:03] to find out which bond to buy this year
[49:05] which which uh portfolio uh to balance
[49:09] out and diversify and all that crap that
[49:12] we have in the financial system uh it's
[49:15] it's just Bitcoin honestly so it's it's
[49:18] it's very it's it's a
[49:20] fascinating uh uh thing for
[49:23] me yeah and and I wrote an article
[49:26] Bitcoin magazine called um Bitcoin
[49:29] retirement generational wealth planning
[49:31] and if you want to see the numbers the
[49:33] math it's very simple to do on your own
[49:36] I'll go through one example right now is
[49:38] and you don't need a lot of Bitcoin I
[49:40] mean at the time I wrote this Bitcoin
[49:42] was um let's see what it was worth
[49:45] Bitcoin was worth
[49:49] 60 68,000 a coin so that was when we
[49:53] were at starting to go back down well
[49:55] this is written in um
[49:57] 2021 but I was trying to tell people the
[50:00] importance of just having a 0.1 Bitcoin
[50:03] which is the time of 68 01 Bitcoin $680
[50:07] or one Bitcoin but I emphasized on the
[50:10] 01 and the 01 Bitcoin to prove the point
[50:14] you don't have to have one full Bitcoin
[50:15] that great if you can get there but
[50:18] additionally to having 01 Bitcoin you
[50:20] got to keep on saving in Bitcoin so in
[50:23] one example if a person start off with 6
[50:26] $8 of Bitcoin which at the time was 01
[50:29] of a Bitcoin and they were able to save
[50:33] $5,200 a year which is about $100 a week
[50:37] over 30 years at an in at a compound
[50:41] annual growth rate of
[50:42] 25% they have $21
[50:45] million I mean I started investing in my
[50:49] retirement at
[50:51] 21 um this number is not a p the sky
[50:57] number this is very
[50:58] achievable um and I would say it's
[51:01] actually very conservative I wrote the
[51:04] article to be very conservative
[51:06] purposely so if you go to um money chimp
[51:11] compound interest
[51:12] calculator what the the argument is that
[51:15] Bitcoin doesn't ACR interest and and
[51:17] that's true that the notion of getting
[51:20] interest on your Bitcoin is is not what
[51:22] you want we're talking about the
[51:24] compound annual growth rate if you use
[51:27] the compound interest calculator it'll
[51:29] give you the same result as a compound
[51:31] annual growth rate so just remember that
[51:34] you don't need to earn interest on your
[51:37] Bitcoin that's stupid because Bitcoin is
[51:39] already acre or sorry already growing at
[51:42] a rate of 100% or more a year so if you
[51:45] want to know how much Bitcoin you have
[51:49] uh in Fiat terms which I'm trying to
[51:53] I've been trying to change that
[51:54] mentality the most most more Bitcoin you
[51:57] have is basically that's the number you
[51:58] want to know just how much Bitcoin you
[52:00] have but if you do want to know how much
[52:02] your Bitcoin will be worth in the future
[52:04] um you can use a compound interest
[52:07] calculator and in this case you put your
[52:10] current amount of Bitcoin the Fiat
[52:11] amount you put the uh amount that you
[52:14] want to save annually the years that you
[52:17] want it to grow and the compound annual
[52:20] growth rate and that's how you'll be
[52:22] able to find out how much your Bitcoin
[52:23] be worth understanding that it doesn't
[52:26] comp compensate for inflation so when
[52:29] it's all said and done be your own
[52:31] financial advisor manage your own money
[52:33] because you care about at the most save
[52:37] in
[52:38] Bitcoin and if if I can't convince
[52:41] someone to save in Bitcoin because it's
[52:42] it's it's hard it's it's it's there's a
[52:45] lot of falsities out there still
[52:46] someone's just not going to start saving
[52:48] a Bitcoin at a minimum I tell them that
[52:50] they should save in gold and silver and
[52:52] I know I'll get a lot of flap from
[52:54] bitcoiners in that regard but only
[52:56] scarce assets is the name of the Fiat
[53:01] game and prior to bitcoin I was I was
[53:04] buying Real Estate apartments and
[53:06] houses and gold and silver and water
[53:09] rights and that was my means to win the
[53:12] game of monoply I no longer have to be a
[53:15] rent Seeker because that is rent seeking
[53:18] Behavior I just save my mom always
[53:20] taught me they for rain
[53:23] day um and I've since learned that I
[53:27] need to save but I need to
[53:29] save in things that are not
[53:32] inflating um and it's I'll say something
[53:36] else that's
[53:37] taboo you do need to have some Savings
[53:39] in
[53:41] cash but for instances where you have an
[53:45] emergency and that's what I do you have
[53:47] a little bit of cash Bitcoin I have gold
[53:50] I have silver I still have things I
[53:52] don't I'm not balls to the wall Bitcoin
[53:56] relatively speaking I
[53:58] am but um there's no problem with having
[54:03] a little bit of other scarce assets and
[54:06] a little bit of cash because if you look
[54:09] up the metrics for Americans I believe
[54:12] it's about over 75% of Americans cannot
[54:15] afford a
[54:16] $400 um expense that just comes randomly
[54:22] and that's says you that tell you
[54:23] everything you needed know people do not
[54:25] have savings so matter of fact people
[54:28] have just mimicked their Federal
[54:31] governments in the fact that they just
[54:34] accumulate more and more debt they they
[54:37] basically are monkey SE monkeyd the vast
[54:40] majority of the United States and all
[54:42] over the world monkey see monkeyd some
[54:45] countries better than other uh Japanese
[54:47] are known for being Savers the
[54:49] Chinese but everyone else are debt their
[54:52] debtors they have credit card debt they
[54:55] have exorbitant debt the simple thing is
[54:58] as Bingo says that he's a well-known
[55:00] putter guy stay solvent what does that
[55:02] mean stay solvent means that when you
[55:05] get into the pickle if a debt collector
[55:07] comes to you and says hey I need 10,000
[55:11] if you can't pay you're not
[55:14] solving you need to have more income
[55:17] than you have
[55:19] expenses that's basically the definition
[55:21] of being solvent you you need to be able
[55:24] when someone comes to you and says hey
[55:27] give me my money you have to give them
[55:29] your money and you can't give them their
[55:31] money in the form of getting a loan and
[55:33] pay them that means you're not solve it
[55:37] I'll stop there it's it's
[55:40] um it it's so underrated and uh
[55:44] everybody has his own situation if you
[55:47] are like uh like me I'm I still have a
[55:51] little cash always uh I actually also
[55:54] own gold uh but not because it has I
[55:58] made the intentional decision to buy it
[56:00] it's just like something I got gifted
[56:02] from a family member and it has
[56:04] emotional value to me but still I have
[56:06] it uh and for me I'm like 25 I have no
[56:11] kids I have no family uh I can like get
[56:13] tomorrow to zero and I'm fine like if if
[56:16] I if I lose everything it's fine but
[56:19] there are other people uh especially if
[56:21] they have family if they have a big
[56:23] company if they have responsibility to
[56:25] to pay someone the the next few months
[56:29] uh it's a different situation and you
[56:32] might want to consider to actually have
[56:34] even feared uh savings feat cash laying
[56:38] around for the next few months uh and
[56:42] you should never come in that like just
[56:44] prevent the situation that you have to
[56:46] sell your Bitcoin uh unless you live in
[56:49] El Salvador and you can easily spend
[56:52] your Bitcoin and you easily can just use
[56:54] your Bitcoin without cap gains
[56:57] implications tax implications stuff like
[56:59] that then like why not full on bitcoin
[57:02] honestly it's it's more more stable in
[57:05] Fiat system especially when you're in El
[57:07] Salvador U but
[57:09] it's so like if you are in a situation
[57:13] where you have tax implications when you
[57:15] sell Bitcoin uh and uh you you want to
[57:19] consider okay what is what if my income
[57:23] falls out for the next three months uh
[57:27] uh and there's like one two uh
[57:29] unexpected invoices then come in can I
[57:32] handle that and you should be able to
[57:34] handle that and somebody might even want
[57:37] to consider six month some might even
[57:40] want to consider one year uh and some
[57:43] are fine maybe with one month uh
[57:45] depending on the age depending on uh
[57:47] what the living situation is uh if if
[57:50] they father of like three four kids then
[57:52] they need a lot more than if you are
[57:54] like 23 and a single guy and living in
[57:57] in your mom's bedroom it's like uh there
[58:00] are different um situations in life uh
[58:03] but but I was balls steep in like a year
[58:08] ago I'm still like 100% in there but I
[58:12] have a little uh uh cash uh buffer and
[58:18] uh with with my now I'm like independent
[58:21] I'm not relying on a job so this also is
[58:24] like oh I needed a little bit more cash
[58:27] reserves because there I have to pay
[58:29] taxes for stuff that I made in the past
[58:32] uh there there there's like there's a
[58:33] lot of things going on in in in my life
[58:37] where I'm like okay now I have to be a
[58:39] little bit more responsible and I have
[58:40] to a little bit more uh unfortunately be
[58:44] involved with that fat system which I
[58:46] don't like but it's still a thing that I
[58:48] have to do yeah and I think that the
[58:50] point should be made because we tend to
[58:52] get hunnel Vision into including myself
[58:55] retirement planning and financial
[58:56] planning but more more importantly than
[58:59] all that planning is is self planning um
[59:03] you can't eat your Bitcoin you can't eat
[59:05] your gold you can't eat your silver you
[59:07] can't eat your water rights you can't
[59:09] eat your your your
[59:12] house if [ __ ] would go to [ __ ] and I'm
[59:14] not being Dooms there but if if we would
[59:17] get to a a point and and it's it's the
[59:20] reason why people don't think we'll get
[59:21] into this is because we've never gotone
[59:23] in it they say that the people that last
[59:26] experienced a war they're all dead so
[59:29] the people that the new generation
[59:30] they're going to be more pro war because
[59:33] they've never been in a war to know that
[59:34] it's not a good thing uh we've never
[59:36] been to a Great Depression I don't see
[59:38] that as being farfetched as happening
[59:41] and so if it does happen it's better to
[59:43] be prepared than not prepared that's all
[59:45] I live and so just remember uh everyone
[59:48] listening that more so than money um
[59:53] Bitcoin gold silver or currency Piat
[59:57] currency you you need to have the
[59:59] knowledge
[60:02] to be able to figure out where your food
[60:04] comes from grow it
[60:06] yourself if you know how to butcher an
[60:08] animal and eat it those are all kind of
[60:11] long lost
[60:12] arts your community know who lives next
[60:15] to you maintain a relationship with you
[60:18] because when [ __ ] goes to [ __ ] uh when
[60:21] when there is a Calamity that happens
[60:23] even if it's a small one I mean where I
[60:25] live
[60:26] if if it snows one inch everyone's
[60:29] crazed out because we don't get snow and
[60:31] everyone I kid you not when there's a 1
[60:34] inch or two
[60:35] Ines you'll see stores that have a bunch
[60:39] of stuff taken groceries toilet paper
[60:42] it's crazy that's just a tiny that's one
[60:45] inches of snow what happened during
[60:47] covid that was a big thing guess what
[60:50] happened everything started disappearing
[60:51] from the stores um so just be prepared
[60:55] monetarily
[60:56] financially this that and the other
[60:58] that's important but don't lose sight
[61:00] that you need to know have a community
[61:03] built up your knowledge that you have in
[61:05] your head to be able to help your
[61:08] neighbor in something that they can't
[61:10] they don't know and vice
[61:12] versa and the ability to food and water
[61:15] that's make sure that you know how to
[61:17] get your food and water and um like I
[61:20] said I don't mean this to be doomsday
[61:21] it's just it happens it's it's happening
[61:24] in the world today there's there people
[61:26] that actually it behooves them to know
[61:29] how to butcher an animal and where fresh
[61:32] water is and how to get it more so than
[61:34] having money or currency um it's just
[61:37] that in America and other countries
[61:39] we're privileged so make sure that at
[61:42] least you're instilling in your brain
[61:45] and Bitcoin does this I mean Bitcoin
[61:47] actually causes someone to want to
[61:49] become sustainable and resilient and and
[61:52] and not be able to be caught in a pickle
[61:55] so for me
[61:59] Bitcoin and for everybody it changes
[62:01] them but for me it's changed me in many
[62:03] different ways I used to be a saver I us
[62:06] saved a lot I'm a super saver now and I
[62:10] don't do real estate no
[62:12] more um I I try to be more Co cognizant
[62:16] of my
[62:18] health um I've changed my diet a little
[62:21] bit my religious aspect I mean I've
[62:25] never been I've been religious but now
[62:26] I'm not religious I'm more of a agnostic
[62:29] theist it it's changed it's caused me to
[62:32] actually question more than anything
[62:35] everything and I think that's what
[62:37] Bitcoin does once you start verifying
[62:39] and not trusting you'll be the most
[62:42] quizzical questioning person ever and
[62:44] you'll question everything because once
[62:47] you find out that the monetary system is
[62:50] broken and that comes as a surprise at
[62:52] first and then you realize oh [ __ ] this
[62:54] is real and Bitcoin is is the exact
[62:56] opposite of our current monetary system
[62:59] you'll start wondering well what else is
[63:01] a lie what else is wrong and that takes
[63:04] you that's why there's the Bitcoin
[63:05] Rabbit Trail Rabbit Hole sorry it will
[63:07] take you down so many holes you've never
[63:09] been so I can't emphasize more than
[63:12] anything but verify don't trust I've
[63:15] been burnt many times for not doing that
[63:16] in my life I've been more trusting than
[63:20] verifying verify and trust and that
[63:23] simple action will you to question
[63:26] everything in the world that all the
[63:29] sheep and the cows that are just going
[63:32] with it going with the FL there's not
[63:35] many people that are that are going the
[63:38] other way that the herd's going and and
[63:40] when everyone's running that way when
[63:43] you see one person running that way you
[63:44] should stop and think because there's a
[63:47] saying that if everyone's thinking the
[63:49] same thing no one's thinking so just be
[63:52] a person that's thinking always use your
[63:55] critical
[63:56] thinking
[63:58] and it's very important I'll stop
[64:01] there uh I love it so much and I have
[64:05] like written down as always like 20 more
[64:08] uh topics and questions we can get into
[64:11] but uh we are already over the the one
[64:13] hour mark uh and we we should come to to
[64:17] end but this is it's like so many great
[64:19] things that I want to get in and we will
[64:21] cover it maybe in like a second round in
[64:23] like half a year or year uh we wi we
[64:25] when we do on the podcast like a second
[64:27] round with some guests uh before we uh
[64:29] end we we come to the end routine I want
[64:32] to ask you one more question that I
[64:33] started asking all my guests uh what are
[64:36] you currently uh passionate about
[64:39] studying learning uh doing whatever it
[64:42] is which we did not touch on in the
[64:44] podcast like which which we did not
[64:46] cover till now I've been thinking for a
[64:49] long time Al so first of all I've been
[64:50] studying religions and rur religions for
[64:52] a long time I grew up in a Christian
[64:55] based family
[64:56] and I still practice the central tenants
[64:59] of
[65:00] Christianity but I have
[65:02] questioned uh over the last few years
[65:06] religion in general and I have Ambitions
[65:09] of somehow some way maybe starting a
[65:12] podcast on bitcoin and religion because
[65:15] those are my two passions and religion's
[65:17] been my second passion right along line
[65:19] with Bitcoin but I think that currently
[65:24] the only Rel
[65:26] religiosity that's being put into
[65:29] Bitcoin is Christianity there's a book
[65:31] and it's a very good book I highly
[65:32] recommend people read it called thank
[65:34] God for
[65:35] Bitcoin but I think there's a niche and
[65:39] I think there's a lot of bitcoiners that
[65:40] are in this Niche including myself that
[65:42] are agnostic
[65:43] theists that means basically that I
[65:45] believe in a
[65:47] Creator but I don't believe one thing
[65:50] there is a
[65:52] Creator but I am accepting an all
[65:56] religions as far as their Central
[65:57] tenants because if you start looking at
[65:59] those Central tenants very closely they
[66:02] all have similarities like you would
[66:04] never Wonder or believe uh there's hope
[66:07] there's Faith there's love
[66:10] kindness the Ham's
[66:12] code
[66:14] um you can read creation stories that
[66:18] are so similar to the Bible
[66:20] story the stories that we have weaved
[66:23] over thousands and thousands of years
[66:26] my next Journey or my journey that I've
[66:29] been on with Bitcoin is to go down those
[66:32] stories and those and then just verify
[66:36] them not just
[66:38] trust so that be
[66:41] my my next passion project and um I
[66:44] think it'll invigorate conversation
[66:46] amongst our bitcoiners that are
[66:48] similar-minded
[66:49] because it it I know that there are
[66:53] Christian bitcoiners and that's fine I
[66:54] know there's
[66:56] Jewish bitcoiners Muslim
[66:58] bitcoiners uh Hindu
[67:01] bitcoiners but which one of them are
[67:04] right with their religion and all signs
[67:07] that I'm looking at right now is no one
[67:10] knows and no one will ever know because
[67:13] you can't prove any of those without a
[67:16] doubt but what can you prove Bitcoin and
[67:19] it's Bitcoin that has caused me to go
[67:21] and question all the religions of the
[67:23] world and it's been amazing because when
[67:25] you look at
[67:27] it a faith BAS system whether it's Hindu
[67:32] Muslim Christianity it's faith-based
[67:35] what does faith be faith means believing
[67:39] in something you've never
[67:40] seen isn't that contrary to
[67:43] bitcoin so that's basically my next
[67:46] Rabbit Hole
[67:48] you I I'm already looking forward to
[67:50] that like I would love for for you to
[67:52] start a podcast on that and enjoying the
[67:55] show in in that regard because it's it's
[67:58] uh I think the religion topic already
[68:00] came up at least in 10 podcasts and I
[68:04] also had Pastor coin on on my show who
[68:07] who wrote the book and and uh yeah a lot
[68:10] of a lot of great things that I already
[68:12] went in with the podcast but I myself
[68:14] I'm still like uh my opinion on religion
[68:18] is still not really um grounded like I
[68:23] already made a lot of thoughts on that
[68:26] uh I grew up Christian uh I then came
[68:30] far away from Christianity uh now I'm
[68:33] coming a little closer again so like uh
[68:36] I I simply did not did a deep dive I
[68:39] also want to really read the Bible at
[68:42] one point uh and and read those those
[68:45] things because I think it's important
[68:47] before you touge something that you
[68:48] actually dive deep into it uh but yeah
[68:52] it's it's a rabbit hole that uh I'm not
[68:55] not having the time to uh but it will it
[68:57] is a rabbit hole where I will go really
[69:00] deep on at some point and would love for
[69:02] you to have a podcast around that topic
[69:05] um we have an entertain in the podcast
[69:06] where the previous guest is asking a
[69:08] question for the next guest without
[69:09] knowing who the next guest actually is
[69:11] it's kind of like the blockchain where
[69:13] the the blocks are connected to each
[69:15] other um what lesson did you learn the
[69:19] hard way and what changes did you make
[69:22] as a result of
[69:24] it it's actually not not verifying and
[69:28] trusting I I'm I'm a very trusting
[69:31] person in general and as I said before
[69:33] it's burnt
[69:34] me and it's burnt me multiple times
[69:39] recently and I'm a bitcoiner so I mean
[69:42] shame on me I committed a sin but verify
[69:46] don't trust and that'll get you and save
[69:50] you your whole life um so that would be
[69:55] the thing that I recently still working
[69:58] on and um it's hard to work on whenever
[70:02] you believe the best of everybody
[70:05] because I do I believe everyone has the
[70:07] best intentions and are good
[70:09] people but unfortunately there's some
[70:12] Sour Apples and um you got to be able to
[70:15] distinguish between the Good Apples and
[70:16] the sour apples so verify don't trust
[70:19] and um that would be my answer perfect
[70:22] perfect really cool um where can people
[70:24] before I let you go with uh where can
[70:26] people find you where can people find
[70:28] more about you where can people like if
[70:31] they have as questions for you to ask is
[70:34] there like where can people get the best
[70:36] out of you yeah if you go on Twitter
[70:39] that's where I spend most of my time um
[70:42] my Satoshi Journal handle is just that's
[70:45] how you spell satoshi's journal at
[70:48] satoshi's Journal that's on Twitter my
[70:50] personal account is it's kind of hard to
[70:53] say it but Jerin j e r i m i c an
[70:59] 5445 um those would be the best places
[71:03] to see me I mean I I've written for
[71:05] Bitcoin magazine you just I think if you
[71:07] just search my name um back to privacy
[71:10] if you're going to find more about
[71:12] anybody it's going to be me and that's a
[71:13] function of who I work for so I can't I
[71:17] can't hide anything from who I work for
[71:20] so if you just look my name you'll find
[71:22] me on Facebook LinkedIn not hard fight
[71:25] I'm not a shadowy super quarter so that
[71:27] would be my answer yeah I did that today
[71:31] actually because I know you under the
[71:34] guy that is satosi Journal uh so the
[71:37] name Jeremy Garcia was not something
[71:40] that was present in my head and I saw
[71:43] today's uh calendar like Jeremy Garcia
[71:46] Jeremy
[71:48] Garcia who who did I invite like who's
[71:51] Jeremy G and I actually like Googled you
[71:53] and then like okay there was some weird
[71:56] things coming up like other Jeremy gas
[71:59] and and then I was like Jeremy Garcia
[72:01] Bitcoin and then there was the the
[72:03] profile of you coming up from from
[72:05] Bitcoin magazine then I was like okay
[72:08] clicking on the Twitter link and I like
[72:09] ah s's journal and then I made the
[72:11] connection between the name and the and
[72:14] Z Journal because I already always knew
[72:16] the host of s's Journal uh but I did not
[72:19] connect the the name Jeremy Garcia to it
[72:22] so but as when when people want to
[72:25] Google you Jeremy Garcia and Bitcoin
[72:27] then they find you 100% but I will also
[72:30] in the description uh link everything
[72:33] from you like a Twitter handle or
[72:34] something like that I always put in some
[72:37] guests contact so they they can contact
[72:39] you uh uh and in in the way that makes
[72:43] sense and we talked about before and
[72:46] maybe I started just now because you
[72:48] talked about and more and more guests
[72:50] bring it up like like since the first
[72:53] podcast I did uh gu are bringing it up
[72:56] constantly I don't hear it that much
[72:58] like I I don't think like I'm I'm I'm
[73:01] uh I'm sounding like anold
[73:06] schatzer but but guests are keep
[73:09] mentioning it and I guess saying and
[73:13] even like listeners and the comments see
[73:15] I should end the podcast with if I'll be
