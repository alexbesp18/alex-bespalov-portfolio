[00:00] This is the question I always get. Why
[00:01] should I invest into Bitcoin mining when
[00:04] I also can buy Bitcoin? And I always say
[00:06] buy Bitcoin but also do the other thing.
[00:08] Two or three years ago, not to call it
[00:10] mining because the normal people outside
[00:12] of the bubble, they need to understand
[00:14] that it's a it's a data center. You
[00:16] know, there are many data centers out
[00:18] there. Amazon cloud computing completely
[00:21] leveraged inside of Bitcoin. But on the
[00:23] professional company level there's like
[00:24] okay I can do that in 2 years in 3 years
[00:27] even though I will not make a 10x from
[00:30] there to 1 million from 100,000 to 1
[00:32] million but for me it's more safe less
[00:35] volatility hundreds of companies showing
[00:37] their solar power and their battery
[00:40] storage solutions we've been the first
[00:42] company and and I can imagine looking
[00:44] forward into the future next year maybe
[00:46] 10 the year after maybe 25 you know this
[00:49] is also adoption as a Bitcoiner It's
[00:52] it's completely obvious but millions of
[00:55] people and the government says okay that
[00:57] is the way to go then perhaps most
[01:00] people think yeah that's okay that's
[01:02] fine I understand but that's not us
[01:05] [Music]
[01:09] right before we get started with all the
[01:11] topics give the viewers some background
[01:13] who you are and then why you excited
[01:15] about Bitcoin not only about Bitcoin
[01:18] also about Bitcoin mining obviously So
[01:21] my name is Christian Christian Clean 39
[01:24] years old from a small village near
[01:28] Auxburg that is again near Munich so 1
[01:32] hour drive more or less in
[01:34] Bavaria. I have three kids and I run a
[01:37] family business with a longlasting
[01:40] tradition founded by my grandfather Kai
[01:44] Ker 75 years ago. We had our big
[01:47] anniversary anniversary last year. So
[01:51] I'm very proud about that. And yeah, my
[01:53] Bitcoin journey started in
[01:58] 2021. And then um we integrated Bitcoin
[02:01] into our processes into our company, put
[02:04] it on our balance sheets and and then
[02:07] obviously I was a lot of podcasts,
[02:10] conferences, uh keynotes. Um yeah, and
[02:14] it's a and it's a great journey.
[02:16] I love that. And yeah, and it's it's
[02:19] you're taking basically a family
[02:21] business that had nothing to do with
[02:23] Bitcoin uh to be more and more into
[02:26] Bitcoin like almost a strategy move, a
[02:28] micro strategy move in in in Germany. Uh
[02:32] how did you actually uh get get into
[02:34] Bitcoin and discovered that and also
[02:36] decided to not only just buy it
[02:38] personally but also do something with
[02:40] the business with it? That that's a very
[02:42] good question and I and I get it very
[02:44] very often. Uh so it's a it's a huge
[02:47] coincidence because as as the CEO of
[02:49] this big company and when we have lots
[02:51] of facilities and production here and
[02:55] here in Bavaria but also we also we also
[02:58] run a second site in Saxony that is that
[03:01] is in the eastern part of Germany and I
[03:04] am also in charge of all the renovations
[03:06] and construction works here that it's
[03:09] all looking good and this one day um I
[03:13] had a discussion so how should we paint
[03:15] this wall. It's was it was literally
[03:18] about painting walls with this guy and
[03:21] his name's Ingo and uh and we had an
[03:24] espresso together. We because I'm always
[03:27] friendly to all of our partners. We work
[03:29] together for a long long time and and
[03:32] and we came into a discussion about
[03:35] investing and this and that and and real
[03:37] estate. And then he showed me his mobile
[03:39] phone where this this crypto app and
[03:43] said like, "Hey, Chris, you're a CEO.
[03:46] You did study economics at university
[03:49] and uh and so what should I buy? What
[03:52] should I sell? Like trading and stuff
[03:55] like that. There's Bitcoin. There's
[03:56] there's this uh uh this and that in
[03:59] crypto." And I looked at him and said,
[04:01] "Engo, I don't know what you're talking
[04:03] about. I never heard about all of these
[04:05] things, but this is who I am. I wanted
[04:08] to give him him an proper answer. So I
[04:10] did study the technology. I did look
[04:12] into Bitcoin and back then there were
[04:14] not so many podcasts and books and
[04:17] YouTube channels in 2021. I mean when I
[04:21] look back it's like 100 years ago but
[04:24] but it's just four years ago plus
[04:27] minus. And um I always had this yeah
[04:31] negative gut feeling about central bank
[04:33] digital currencies and and social credit
[04:36] system. I was always a big fan of cash,
[04:38] cold hard cash. I don't know why,
[04:42] but so this was u um a contact point
[04:46] with Bitcoin with the technology. But
[04:48] then and that was like for me even more
[04:52] disruptive and mind-blowing when I did
[04:54] look into Bitcoin mining and what it
[04:57] does uh for energy transition being like
[05:00] I say to even today when we go on trade
[05:03] fairs that is important puzzle piece for
[05:05] energy transition in all over Europe not
[05:08] only in Germany and uh we produce goods
[05:12] and things we produce spraying
[05:14] components technical plastic components
[05:16] for the auto for the automo industry.
[05:18] but also cosmetics. So for me it was
[05:21] crystal clear that we also have to
[05:24] produce bitcoin within our company and
[05:27] also to get to get independent um from
[05:31] grid operators and the markets and
[05:34] regulation and this and that. So this is
[05:36] the whole journey in a nutshell very
[05:39] short. Yeah. I I love that that you not
[05:42] only went ahead and said like, "Oh, like
[05:44] we we I like Bitcoin, but let's let's
[05:47] find something we can do in Bitcoin and
[05:50] let's produce Bitcoin." So, you started
[05:52] Bitcoin mining. I guess you also started
[05:54] adopting Bitcoin in some shape or form
[05:56] on the balance sheet. Yes, exactly. Uh
[06:00] so in 2021
[06:02] um when I was orange build um it took
[06:06] round about two more months also to
[06:10] integrated into our company strategy
[06:12] because as a as a family business um
[06:17] long-lasting tradition uh you cannot you
[06:20] cannot differentiate completely between
[06:22] private life and then also the company
[06:25] and and and what you're doing there. And
[06:28] there was also um the
[06:31] specific yeah this topic which didn't
[06:34] get out of my mind didn't get out of my
[06:36] head when we partner with our banks and
[06:40] and let's say we have five or six
[06:43] traditional banks we work together and
[06:46] we have deposits there and we we have
[06:48] money there for for bad times
[06:51] especially. So we did save in euro back
[06:53] then in fiat and there was this time um
[06:57] with the uh with the with the negative
[07:00] um income rates and stuff like that you
[07:02] know so that the banks charged us they
[07:06] wanted to charge us that we have our
[07:08] money our money that we earned over
[07:10] decades they wanted to charge us so that
[07:14] didn't get into my head as well so on
[07:16] top this was the solution Bitcoin to
[07:19] have Bitcoin on our balance sheet
[07:20] integrated in a in in a serious way, you
[07:23] know, and not like like the like the
[07:26] Bitcoin maximalist going all in and then
[07:28] also leverage it to the maximum, but in
[07:31] a serious way, traditional family
[07:34] business philosophy, thinking across
[07:36] generations. This is our philosophy. So,
[07:39] this this philosophy perfectly fits the
[07:42] the Bitcoin long-term thinking
[07:44] philosophy. So um we save in Bitcoin
[07:49] certain amount and we do it until today
[07:51] and for many many decades to come. That
[07:55] that's such an weird thing. I I heard
[07:58] that too and it was really really
[08:00] interesting for me to hear that that not
[08:02] only you're giving them your money. Not
[08:05] only they're extracting already
[08:08] inflation from that the banking system,
[08:10] but then also like oh yeah please pay us
[08:13] something so we have your money and you
[08:16] have no control over it. Like what is
[08:18] that? That was a really weird concept.
[08:21] Yeah. Yeah. If you think about that like
[08:23] as a Bitcoiner it's it's completely
[08:26] obvious but when when millions of people
[08:29] and the government says okay that is the
[08:32] way to go then perhaps most people think
[08:35] yeah that's okay that's fine I
[08:37] understand but that's not us right yeah
[08:41] I'm I'm often asking myself uh when this
[08:44] big awakening moment in in in society
[08:47] will come and they see like oh I I don't
[08:49] own the money they extract inflation
[08:51] rates from me. I may may have to pay a
[08:55] uh pay a big uh banking fee or anything
[08:58] like that. So, I don't know like when
[09:00] there's there's a big moment coming or
[09:02] the moment might never come and Bitcoin
[09:04] just comes in our society uh through the
[09:06] back door a little bit like TCP IP
[09:08] protocol. Most people have no clue about
[09:10] it but still use it every day. So, I'm
[09:12] I'm I'm thinking a lot about that. Uh
[09:15] but first, I can tell you Robert, it's
[09:17] definitely happening at the moment as we
[09:20] speak. this whole um corporate adoption
[09:24] of Bitcoin on balance sheets. I mean,
[09:26] you have to imagine 2021 when I did
[09:29] that, it was not so easy to even find a
[09:32] crypto exchange or even I mean Bitcoin
[09:35] only exchange where where you can go as
[09:38] a classic German limited company because
[09:41] it's something different compared to
[09:43] being a private person retail investor
[09:47] going to some whatever nowadays but back
[09:50] then it was not so easy. I had to go to
[09:52] Kraken and we needed all these company
[09:56] documents, list of shareholder and this
[09:58] and that. The person behind the
[10:01] companies, the decision makers, uh um
[10:04] company company registry all in English
[10:07] and it was not there back back then and
[10:10] nowadays you have several Bitcoin only
[10:13] um exchanges from Austria or from from
[10:16] someplace else. where as a company as a
[10:19] German German limited company uh um you
[10:22] can open up an account and buy buy
[10:25] Bitcoin
[10:26] even you even have your own personal VIP
[10:31] consultant where you can trade OTC and
[10:34] stuff like that so it's a different time
[10:36] now four years later
[10:39] is that mostly on the corporate side I
[10:42] feel like the last years it was a really
[10:44] high focus on institutional money on
[10:46] corporate adoption with micro strategy
[10:48] leading the way but semi scientific
[10:50] there are many famous examples I mean uh
[10:53] you also and I scale small scale
[10:57] [Music]
[10:59] compared compared to strategy but like
[11:03] most German companies are small compared
[11:06] to strategy I guess but yeah like those
[11:09] um those things is really kind of
[11:12] accelerating fast and faster and now we
[11:15] even have I think this just happened
[11:17] last week or this week where Coinbase
[11:19] now now is in the S&P 500 and I think
[11:21] it's just a matter of time this strategy
[11:24] hopefully also gets in there and we also
[11:26] already have Tesla in there that also
[11:28] still holds Bitcoin on the balance
[11:30] sheet. It's it really feels like there's
[11:32] a huge focus on institutional adoption.
[11:35] I I I just feel that retail is is really
[11:38] sleeping on this one. Yeah, look at the
[11:40] Google searches and that's exactly what
[11:43] I was heading. We're we're above
[11:46] 100,000K. We're maybe going to 150 20
[11:48] 300,000K and retail is completely
[11:51] sleeping. And uh I'm asking myself why
[11:54] and where do we need to go when when
[11:57] when we when we talk about the Bitcoin
[12:00] price or adoption? But at the end Robin
[12:03] what you need and this was my goal goal
[12:06] all along in my vision to be a role
[12:08] model to be a pioneer for others because
[12:11] look uh back in 2021 when I started my
[12:14] journey going on conferences I didn't
[12:16] even use my real full name like
[12:19] Christian Cle I did I used my Twitter
[12:22] name for one and a half years like when
[12:24] I started doing keynotes Bitcoin hotel
[12:27] notelia stoodgat and and this and that
[12:29] and inspoke and so on and so on. It was
[12:31] a weird feeling when I was uh when I was
[12:35] invited to my first podcast and then um
[12:38] as someone said my guest today is
[12:40] Christian Cleger from Auxburg and back
[12:42] then and and until today there are
[12:44] hundreds hundreds of family businesses
[12:47] long businesses with traditional
[12:49] corporations that integrated a bitcoin
[12:52] strategy but not but not in public. You
[12:55] know, I know so many companies and we we
[12:58] set up and and we execute all those
[13:00] trainings and workshops for these
[13:02] companies because this is one of our
[13:03] services we offer to businesses. The
[13:06] trainings and workshops third
[13:07] generation, fifth generation here from
[13:09] Nunburg, from Frankfurt, energy energy
[13:12] producers, grid operators, they're all
[13:15] interested in Bitcoin and the Bitcoin
[13:17] technology. But maybe some of them will
[13:20] get into Bitcoin when the price is at
[13:23] 300,000 or 400,000 because of volatility
[13:25] reason or more more more adoption. And
[13:30] and we see when we talk to to to to um
[13:33] to to to some companies they want to
[13:36] wait because they're afraid what what
[13:38] are my employees thinking about me? What
[13:42] are my customers my suppliers thinking
[13:43] about me? And they had the same
[13:45] thoughts. I understand. I totally
[13:47] understand. And I can tell you and also
[13:49] all the all the guests inside uh
[13:53] watching and looking at your podcast
[13:55] your show there is nothing bad happening
[13:58] to you guys. So decision makers CEOs
[14:01] integrate Bitcoin and get into into
[14:03] public because I talked to to uh to
[14:06] Julian to Julian Lininger from Relay. We
[14:10] had been uh to this conference in in
[14:13] Swiss and and he said there are already
[14:16] 250 companies listed 250 companies
[14:20] listed on relay saving regularly on a
[14:23] regular basis in Bitcoin. That is
[14:25] amazing. But where are these companies
[14:28] in public that you know these
[14:30] traditional companies? But these are the
[14:32] role models we need in the future. And I
[14:34] guess within the next six to 12 months,
[14:37] we will see lots of them coming out. It
[14:40] it's such an interesting topic when we
[14:42] think about there are so many companies
[14:45] that have Bitcoin but just don't tell us
[14:48] uh because they don't want to go pack
[14:49] big with that. Um I I want to first
[14:53] touch on your journey with that. Was
[14:55] there any bad experience from customers,
[14:59] suppliers, employees when you announced
[15:01] like, hey, we we now also have that
[15:03] Bitcoin strategy with Terraash but also
[15:06] on the balance sheet. Was there any any
[15:09] bad experience like oh like is it safe
[15:11] like is is the company going under
[15:13] because they are gambling on Bitcoin or
[15:15] anything like that? It's very
[15:16] interesting question and I would love to
[15:20] sometimes be in those discussions at our
[15:23] company during the breaks uh when people
[15:26] talk because I'm not always there. We
[15:28] have 300 employees, three companies. And
[15:32] you and you have to and you have to
[15:34] think about that we sell our own
[15:37] spraying systems on a worldwide basis to
[15:40] Japan, to Australia,
[15:42] um to to to North America, lots of
[15:45] products going to
[15:47] Canada.
[15:48] And I did not get approached directly by
[15:53] anybody that said, "Oh, I I cannot
[15:56] support you and this is the reason why I
[15:58] will not buy your product anymore." I
[16:00] mean, when you're happy with this
[16:02] product and the price is okay, so the
[16:04] value proposition is fine. Why should
[16:07] you go to another company? because the
[16:09] owner decides on founding another
[16:13] company going into new areas uh new
[16:18] technology innovative technology
[16:21] uh so there were no such no such
[16:24] incidents like that with customers and
[16:27] suppliers um and with employees I mean
[16:30] think about that it's also not only
[16:32] about financial statement and being a
[16:35] robust player and to have a robust
[16:38] balance sheet
[16:39] It's also about the so-called corporate
[16:41] branding. I mean, everybody talks about
[16:43] corporate branding and and and how to
[16:46] find talent in your company. And I and I
[16:49] guess what I've seen so far with what
[16:52] I've experienced over the last three
[16:53] four years, uh my colleagues, my
[16:56] employees, most of them are very very
[16:58] proud that we also have this new
[17:01] company. I mean, even get invited to
[17:03] international podcast like you are.
[17:05] Nobody invited me before we had Bitcoin
[17:08] and the startup Terraash to
[17:11] international podcasts or speaking at
[17:14] international conferences or trade fairs
[17:17] because it's a it's such a new topic and
[17:20] disruptive topic. Yeah, that's a it's a
[17:23] good point. I mean you can see it
[17:25] probably again with the strategy micro
[17:27] strategy um comparison they have now
[17:31] such a bigger exposure to customers
[17:35] because Michael Sailor just got a lot
[17:38] more famous in the in the financial
[17:39] world a lot more famous in the CEO world
[17:42] and he is a lot more on on the CNBC's
[17:45] and all those players on this this is
[17:48] making strategy better even the business
[17:50] that has actually nothing to do with
[17:52] with Bitcoin they have like an IT
[17:54] business that has not really anything to
[17:56] do with Bitcoin. But this also get gets
[17:59] better from that. That's that's really
[18:00] interesting. So then the question for me
[18:02] is like why are so many businesses still
[18:05] hiding? You tell me. I don't know. I
[18:08] don't know. So I guess we are in our
[18:11] bubble, you know, and we think we're we
[18:13] we came so far and and it's so
[18:15] professional and there's so many experts
[18:17] in the business and there is this
[18:19] billionaire in Mexico or whatever and
[18:22] all the and all the entrepreneurs, the
[18:24] CEOs in the states and so on and so on.
[18:27] But obviously uh when you go uh on the
[18:32] streets and you look at the people
[18:34] walking around maybe still
[18:37] 90% have never heard of Bitcoin the
[18:41] Bitcoin technology what is money
[18:44] truly. So that is still a big issue to
[18:48] to educate to to bring the Bitcoin
[18:52] message to the people and I guess and we
[18:54] we will talk about Terash and Bitcoin
[18:57] mining I guess in the second part. One
[19:00] angle to bring the technology to the
[19:03] people is what type of problems and
[19:06] challenges can Bitcoin and the
[19:08] technology really solve and address. So
[19:11] and if you go to someone and say hey I
[19:13] have something here please take it and
[19:16] then you are going to be very rich soon
[19:19] I don't know if that works you know uh
[19:22] so when you go there hey there's a new
[19:24] technology like a protocol and you
[19:27] mentioned that earlier like the internet
[19:30] um it's it's decentralized and so on and
[19:33] so on all all those things and and maybe
[19:35] give them two or three books or send
[19:38] them two or three links to your podcast
[19:39] or other podcasts
[19:41] Um, and I guess then you see is there a
[19:44] basic interest? Is there is there a
[19:47] spark in their eyes? Because then I I
[19:50] like to help them. If there's only a
[19:52] that's all BS and get away, then I'm
[19:56] then I'm like, okay, it's not your time
[19:59] yet. Yeah, I guess we are really early
[20:01] in in the education. And I think if we
[20:03] are in this bubble, we kind of forget
[20:05] how early we really are. And I think
[20:08] every Bitcoiner who listens to a lot of
[20:11] podcasts or is a lot in the industry,
[20:14] just do the exercise and go out on a
[20:16] normal business street and ask 20 people
[20:19] what they think about Bitcoin and then
[20:20] you know how really early we are to this
[20:23] game. I mean just an example for
[20:26] you two years ago we had been to the
[20:29] invest trade fair. It's about the
[20:33] investment, invest your money, this and
[20:35] that and gold, silver and all of these
[20:38] things obviously also so real estate and
[20:42] and and we had the first booth there two
[20:45] years ago with my newly founded startup
[20:48] Terraash
[20:49] um where we did show Bitcoin, Bitcoin
[20:53] education, Bitcoin books together with
[20:55] Fab from Upreico Media and this like a
[20:58] like a big booth for the whole Bitcoin
[21:01] industry. It it was a first test you
[21:04] know two years ago and there were many
[21:06] people many people approaching us like
[21:08] ah that's speculation that's only for c
[21:11] criminals I mean there micro strategy
[21:13] was brand new the only company no meta
[21:16] planet no 21 capital and all of these
[21:18] things you have now no black rockck ETFs
[21:20] stuff like that and also yeah
[21:23] speculation criminals no nobody needs it
[21:27] and so on and so on like we've heard it
[21:28] all two years ago And now like
[21:32] completely fresh and and brand new
[21:35] experience. We had been at the trade
[21:37] fair um in Munich Interolar Empower.
[21:40] It's a combined trade fair for energy
[21:42] solutions, software solutions, but also
[21:45] batteries, storage systems, solar power.
[21:49] There was not one person and there were
[21:52] lots of business contacts we had with
[21:54] grid operators and so on and so on,
[21:56] energy producers. Not one said these
[21:59] things. They were all in interested and
[22:01] they wanted to dig deeper like okay how
[22:04] much is this technology how many
[22:07] kilowatts does it transform into digital
[22:10] monetary energy and and all of these
[22:13] questions going deeper. So, and they and
[22:18] they and they already decided on okay
[22:20] that could be interesting that could be
[22:22] an interesting technology as a rack or
[22:24] as a container solution and and still we
[22:28] we've been the first booth and it wasn't
[22:30] huge one one of the biggest trade fairs
[22:32] all over Europe and in the world was the
[22:34] first booth together with two or three
[22:37] smaller
[22:38] ones where we addressed Bitcoin mining
[22:41] solely. I I mean you I mean you have to
[22:44] imagine that how early that is. There
[22:45] were like hundreds of hundreds of
[22:48] companies showing their solar power and
[22:51] their battery storage solutions and
[22:53] we've been the first company and and I
[22:56] can imagine looking forward into the
[22:58] future next year maybe 10 the year the
[23:01] year after maybe 25 you know this is
[23:04] also
[23:05] adoption that's super interesting and I
[23:08] want to get to mining uh uh really
[23:10] quickly but before uh I want to get one
[23:13] more thing is the the balance sheet of a
[23:16] nation state. Uh how you look at that
[23:18] because I was completely surprised when
[23:21] the USA announced that they might do
[23:23] something like that and the Trump is all
[23:25] of the sudden on Bitcoin conferences uh
[23:27] last year in Nashville. I also see now
[23:30] that the vice president JD Vance which I
[23:33] think hasn't said so much about Bitcoin
[23:35] yet is now on the Bitcoin conference in
[23:38] Las Vegas which will be really uh fun to
[23:41] see. uh how do you look at the same
[23:44] thing that is started with companies I
[23:47] guess in 2020 with with with strategy on
[23:50] a public space is now starting with with
[23:52] with uh countries like America Salvador
[23:55] even Bhudan.
[23:57] Yeah. When when you did talk about
[24:01] nation state adoption, I was I was
[24:03] thinking about Bhutan because it it's
[24:05] such an amazing story about the king of
[24:08] Bhutan getting orange pill many years
[24:10] ago and now and and it's such a a poor
[24:14] country and uh and limited obviously
[24:17] limited economic power because of their
[24:20] geography and this and that and many
[24:23] many things and issues. Um but what they
[24:26] have is a ministry of happiness. This is
[24:28] something which I like. And I also like
[24:31] obviously the fact that onethird of
[24:33] their of their BIP is is is created and
[24:38] produced by Bitcoin mining. One/ird you
[24:41] have to imagine obviously it's a small
[24:42] country but still uh this is this is a
[24:45] lot. If you would transform this to
[24:48] Germany be because I read that some
[24:50] somewhere that would be more than the
[24:54] whole bitcoin mining network the global
[24:56] bitcoin mining network when onethird of
[24:59] the German the German economy would be
[25:01] bitcoin mining. So we have uh more room
[25:05] to grow here in Germany as well. But
[25:07] coming back to your coming back to your
[25:10] question, it's not a new discussion with
[25:11] the nation state adoption and when and
[25:14] when El Salvador made it public there
[25:17] were like Samson Mao and these people
[25:19] like okay there's going to be three more
[25:21] states this year. Okay, not no state at
[25:24] all. And then and then the year after
[25:27] yeah there's going to be five state and
[25:29] it's going to be this state in Africa
[25:31] and this state in South America. And
[25:34] what really happened?
[25:36] Okay, my op my opinion on that, my take
[25:39] on that is it needs decision
[25:43] makers, entrepreneurs like Michael
[25:45] Sailor and these guys and on a very very
[25:47] tiny smaller level, family business
[25:50] owners like myself say, "Okay, that's
[25:52] the way to go and I don't have to ask
[25:54] anyone. I've done my research. Do your
[25:57] own research and now this is the way to
[25:59] go. Be a role model." And this is this
[26:02] is also what's happening with the um
[26:04] with the grid operators and the energy
[26:06] producers in Germany and also the
[26:09] villages and the cities looking into
[26:11] Bitcoin. They are looking into Bitcoin
[26:13] with us together. That is amazing. But
[26:15] they're also asking me, okay, I don't
[26:17] want to be the first. Where are two or
[26:20] three pilot projects where we can look
[26:22] at? I'm like, okay, we have 20 of those
[26:25] projects in line, but none of them want
[26:28] to be the first. And I guess it's the
[26:29] same with nation state adoption. And
[26:32] also when when you look at the states of
[26:35] America, not the whole um America, the
[26:39] USA, it also takes time, you know, and u
[26:43] and it's not so and it's not so easy.
[26:45] You have to talk to politicians and so
[26:48] on and so on. And those guys, they want
[26:52] to get reelected. I don't have to think
[26:54] about getting reelected next year or in
[26:56] two or in two or in two years. go. But
[27:00] I'm but I'm still very bullish on nation
[27:03] state adoption obviously but I guess
[27:06] it's going to be the companies the
[27:09] bigger companies publicly listed
[27:11] companies and I guess there's this list
[27:13] it's more than 100 huge publicly listed
[27:16] companies having a Bitcoin strategy
[27:17] Bitcoin on their balance and on top
[27:20] thousands already thousands of family
[27:23] businesses also integrating integrating
[27:25] a strategy. What I' what I'm sad about
[27:29] and I think about that a lot when all
[27:31] the companies that there is more
[27:33] companies on the world than 21 million
[27:35] companies. You know there's not one
[27:36] bitcoin for each and every company. Uh
[27:39] so the problem is or the challenge is
[27:42] bitcoin is a bottom up technology
[27:44] grassroots development. Uh we need to
[27:47] have bitcoin left for retail investors.
[27:49] You know this is this is very important.
[27:53] That's a that is super interesting. I
[27:55] never looked at there's more than 21
[27:56] million companies. I never got because
[27:59] there I I always knew the comparison
[28:01] with millionaires. There's I think like
[28:03] 60 or 70 millionaires in the world. So
[28:05] not even every millionaire gets a whole
[28:08] bitcoin. But then additionally there
[28:09] also companies that also want bitcoin.
[28:11] So there's not even enough bitcoin for
[28:14] each company to have a full bitcoin. And
[28:17] then uh yeah like we already have uh OGs
[28:21] in the space that are not now not
[28:23] millionaires but already have more than
[28:25] a bitcoin 5 million coins lost and and
[28:28] also a strategy approaching 600,00021
[28:33] capital and Nakamoto they all want
[28:35] 500,000 bitcoins I I mean h how is that
[28:38] possible? I I guess one bitcoin will be
[28:40] like owning a city at some point I guess
[28:42] when when we look at the scarcity of of
[28:44] it. I also like the the thing you said
[28:47] that nobody wants to be the first. Uh
[28:50] but it's like the second or the the
[28:52] third is just so much easier to to get
[28:55] in if there's like a pilot program
[28:56] already deployed. Um but yeah, let let's
[28:59] focus now a little bit on on on Bitcoin
[29:02] mining. Uh why did you choose Bitcoin
[29:04] mining as as a focus for the for the
[29:06] company? Because as I said earlier, for
[29:08] me it was so fascinating and disruptive
[29:11] and I and I was one of the first two or
[29:15] three years ago not to call it mining
[29:17] because the normal people outside of the
[29:20] bubble they need to understand that it's
[29:22] a it's a data center you know there are
[29:24] many data centers out there Amazon cloud
[29:27] computing HPC now AI obviously and this
[29:32] is
[29:33] another another type of data center with
[29:36] very specific uh um features and
[29:40] advantages compared to other data
[29:42] centers and and this is it. It is a data
[29:45] center. It's inside of a container and
[29:48] most people even though obviously it's
[29:50] it's very good to know and very
[29:52] fascinating to know what really happens
[29:55] in mining and the pools and and all of
[29:57] these things behind mining. What what
[30:00] are the fundamentals? But most of the
[30:02] decision makers, people that are
[30:04] interested and companies, corporations
[30:06] that are interested in in mining, um
[30:10] they want to know, okay, how much
[30:12] electricity gets in and what comes out.
[30:15] And people, especially in Germany and
[30:18] Europe, um we've always been pioneering
[30:21] in vertically integrated energy systems.
[30:24] One thing gets in, two things come out.
[30:27] Like biomass with lots of biomass here
[30:29] in Bavaria. um u um um um PA plants. So
[30:35] there are with gas. So we have so many
[30:38] things where and technologies when we
[30:40] know for decades one thing in two things
[30:42] out and with Bitcoin mining this is the
[30:44] way I try to explain it each and every
[30:46] time and I will not stop with that. Um
[30:49] that you have a black box. I call it
[30:51] blackbox and and also and you um you are
[30:55] going to know this guy Florian Bruce boy
[30:57] he and he also wrote a a very very a
[31:01] good book and there's this one quote um
[31:04] from me inside where also refer to
[31:06] bitcoin mining as a black box kilowatt
[31:09] hour of electricity gets in this black
[31:11] box and a monetary value gets out
[31:15] independent of your grid your location
[31:18] decentralized global and also heat. And
[31:22] this is something two or three years ago
[31:24] it was the first first steps also by the
[31:28] manufacturers the Chinese manufacturies
[31:31] that they got to understand that heat is
[31:33] a product that heat is not only
[31:36] something you have to deal with because
[31:38] obviously in back in the day when you
[31:41] only had air cooled mining systems heat
[31:43] was not good. You wanted to reduce the
[31:46] amount of heat and the temperatures
[31:48] obviously because it was not good for
[31:50] the chips and the efficiency and the
[31:52] performance of mining the hash power you
[31:54] get out and how long all of those
[31:57] machines last. now two or three years
[31:59] later, but also because we tell them as
[32:02] Europeans, as as as German companies
[32:05] wanting to integrate Bitcoin mining into
[32:07] the structures here in Europe, we tell
[32:09] them heat is good. Water cooled mining
[32:12] solutions are the future. if it's if
[32:15] it's immersion for some types of
[32:16] application but also real hydrocooled
[32:19] solutions where you have water flowing
[32:22] closely by the chips and taking all
[32:25] taking the heat and heat is especially
[32:28] in Germany and Europe a very valuable
[32:30] product of the future and heat pumps
[32:32] will not solve all of our problems in
[32:35] energy transition and regulation we have
[32:38] um in in Germany and I was uh I was
[32:41] honored to also speak at the German
[32:43] Bundist
[32:45] um last year in March exactly about this
[32:48] topic. How can Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[32:50] especially Bitcoin mining help Germany
[32:54] and the German electricity prices to be
[32:57] uh stable? So that is also uh very very
[33:00] very important to know and very amazing.
[33:03] I love that and I want to get later a
[33:05] little bit to the Bitcoin in Europe
[33:07] versus other nation but mining is so
[33:10] interesting. I love the framing also as
[33:12] a data center. I guess when you go to
[33:15] booths like on the invest trade fair,
[33:18] you get a lot of the question of like
[33:20] why a bitcoin data center and not an AI
[33:22] data center or uh questions like that.
[33:25] Do do you compare those uh those two or
[33:28] maybe even like other ones? uh because
[33:30] as you said it uh for someone who says
[33:33] like oh I put electricity in and there's
[33:35] something of value coming out and uh
[33:38] they they they don't even have to really
[33:40] care what's going on inside there. I
[33:42] mean as Bitcoiners we care but there's
[33:44] an investor that just wants to invest in
[33:46] in some container like that. Uh do you
[33:49] have like comparisons to Bitcoin data
[33:51] centers versus like AI and stuff like
[33:53] that? Yeah, this is this is so
[33:56] interesting. When I look back at the
[33:57] last two or three years, we talked to
[34:00] producers of wind power, solar power,
[34:04] whatever. We had to approach them
[34:06] actively or there was this trade fair or
[34:09] the conference or this and that or the
[34:12] the we're very honored and proud to be
[34:14] in the local newspaper and also on
[34:17] television. Not many Bitcoin startups
[34:20] make it to the German television yet.
[34:22] maybe maybe in a few years more more
[34:24] more role models like us and there's a
[34:28] difference there's definitely a shift
[34:30] happening at the moment and I would say
[34:33] I would say two or three years ago it
[34:35] was only the discussion okay Bitcoin
[34:37] mining versus
[34:40] um battery storage or heat pump and I
[34:44] said one year ago two years ago we did
[34:47] lots of research studies and data uh
[34:50] gathering data and putting it together
[34:54] to reports and stuff like that. It is
[34:57] not a competition. This is why we still
[35:00] until today say it's one puzzle piece,
[35:02] Bitcoin mining, but not the sole one,
[35:04] not the only one. It's not against the
[35:06] battery storage and it's not against the
[35:08] heat pump. Now 2 years later, heat pump
[35:11] manufacturers, huge brands, but also
[35:14] huge globally operating battery storage
[35:17] producers, they approach us not only at
[35:19] the trade fair, they they visit us here
[35:21] to look into Bitcoin mining to see the
[35:23] technology in our energy lab here in
[35:25] Oxburg because we showcase all mining
[35:28] technologies that are existing, the
[35:30] newest models here. You can book energy
[35:32] lab tours with combined with with
[35:35] trainings and stuff like that. And
[35:37] there's a shift happening that that now
[35:40] but also because of chat and all of
[35:42] these things
[35:44] um the grid operators and all entities
[35:48] related to energy they look into
[35:51] computing let's say computing in general
[35:54] and they say yeah I wanted to put a put
[35:56] uh this uh uh or to integrate this AI
[36:00] data center um in the forest where I
[36:04] have my three uh windmills like and and
[36:07] here here in Germany this is really
[36:08] happening and then they get to know okay
[36:10] with AI huge capex security issues
[36:15] regulation no flexible load you need to
[36:18] have an uptime of 99% and you cannot you
[36:21] cannot uh
[36:23] um uh really create um a an electricity
[36:28] consumer that follows your production
[36:30] curve. I mean there there's this very
[36:33] famous duck curve in solar production
[36:35] but also wind and other renewables have
[36:38] flexible production obviously it's not
[36:41] the same like with with uh nuclear
[36:44] energy or gas pickup plants. So and you
[36:47] cannot use AI for that you can use AI
[36:49] for a base load for example. So what
[36:51] happens and it's so interesting that we
[36:54] have first projects and it's like
[36:56] research projects because we have to
[36:58] create a a combined product where we
[37:01] create terra my startup together with
[37:04] huge German and European brands create
[37:07] the power plant of the future and that
[37:09] means smart combined Bitcoin mining with
[37:12] AI smart combined in some cases Bitcoin
[37:16] mining with battery storage because then
[37:19] there's there's a new robust product
[37:22] that fits the needs of the customer. So
[37:24] this is what happens at the moment.
[37:26] Let's take a break for a moment and
[37:28] appreciate the beauty that Coin
[37:30] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[37:33] watches. Those watches are the most
[37:35] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[37:38] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[37:41] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[37:43] completely new and amazing Genesis
[37:46] edition of their watch collections. You
[37:49] have the date of the first ever mined
[37:52] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[37:54] also the block height and which epoch we
[37:58] are currently in. I love the level of
[38:00] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[38:03] Make sure to check out those amazing
[38:06] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[38:08] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[38:12] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[38:14] really do hope that you don't have it on
[38:16] exchange. But if you do have it on
[38:18] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[38:20] deal with that. The first way is you put
[38:22] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[38:25] entry for you to get into the
[38:27] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[38:30] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[38:33] super simple and secure way. And if you
[38:36] check out the link in the description,
[38:38] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[38:41] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[38:44] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[38:47] partner in terms of how to get the most
[38:50] out of your sovereignty. They will
[38:52] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[38:55] that is perfect for your individual
[38:58] situation. They will show you how you
[39:01] can secure your own devices. Securing
[39:04] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[39:05] have to keep all your devices secure.
[39:08] One topic that is overlooked often is
[39:10] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[39:13] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[39:16] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[39:18] place already? And last but not least,
[39:20] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[39:22] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[39:25] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[39:30] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[39:33] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[39:36] be for the first time ever speaking at
[39:38] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[39:41] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[39:44] really looking forward to seeing all of
[39:45] you there. You can get your ticket in
[39:48] the link down in the description of
[39:50] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[39:52] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[39:56] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[39:58] there. That's fascinating. Uh that's
[40:00] that's really fascinating. And for me,
[40:02] Bitcoin mining is also fascinating
[40:04] because even if you don't like Bitcoin
[40:08] uh politically or like whatever reason,
[40:11] you still have to say, "Oh, Bitcoin
[40:14] mining, for grit balancing, for whatever
[40:17] reason that we already pointed out, it's
[40:19] such a great
[40:21] solution to to energy producers, uh for
[40:24] the grit balancing act." So, it's it's
[40:26] it's even a great solution if you don't
[40:30] like Bitcoin. you you still can't really
[40:33] say anything about Bitcoin mining and
[40:35] that shift happening happened really
[40:37] fast because I don't hear anyone now
[40:40] saying I mean maybe I'm in too deep in
[40:41] the bubble but I don't hear a lot of
[40:44] people saying Bitcoin is now bad for the
[40:46] environment that thing kind of
[40:48] completely this is so
[40:50] 2024 this is so 2023 with the whole
[40:54] green peas issue and stuff like that and
[40:56] and the skull and all these things I had
[40:58] so many uh keynotes about okay Bitcoin
[41:02] is more than 50% green and and even
[41:05] though it's growing we never had that in
[41:07] the last 100 years 200 500 years when we
[41:11] had an industrial revolution of any kind
[41:14] it was always oil and gas fueled I
[41:17] always say that it's for the first time
[41:18] that it's renewable fueled that fueled
[41:21] that it gets more and more green per
[41:24] hash power that gets online but but
[41:27] still I I want to address something and
[41:29] and point something out that we found in
[41:31] our experience over the last three
[41:33] years. Um, obviously everyone says
[41:35] Bitcoin mining is so great to to for for
[41:39] excess energy. The thing is it has to
[41:42] run and there are there are numbers
[41:45] behind it. uh there needs to be a
[41:47] certain amount of uptime per year, per
[41:51] month in there and and so to really
[41:55] point out the specific use cases and
[41:57] what type of technology, what type of
[41:59] capex, what type of generation of
[42:01] machine, what type of performance you
[42:03] use. This is really something very very
[42:06] critally critical. You cannot buy the
[42:09] most expensive newest machine for only
[42:11] solar excess energy where you have 1,000
[42:14] hours per year. So it is not as easy as
[42:16] it seems but but this is most of the
[42:19] time with everything in life like
[42:21] that and this is also definitely true
[42:24] for integrating Bitcoin mining in
[42:26] systems and and and then there's
[42:28] something other uh what is very
[42:31] interesting especially in in energy
[42:33] markets all those players but it was
[42:36] always like that for 50 years for 100
[42:37] years they move so slowly we're we're
[42:40] not used to that in the Bitcoin space
[42:41] the Bitcoin space is all everything
[42:43] moving fast decision-m in energy field
[42:48] slowly slowly but steady security is
[42:51] very important people get their
[42:53] electricity that nothing happens and so
[42:56] on and so on because we've seen those
[42:58] blackouts and it's not going to be the
[43:00] last blackouts in in Spain Portugal and
[43:02] and so on um so this is something which
[43:06] is very interesting because now some of
[43:09] the companies that were in contact with
[43:11] us one and a half years ago huge
[43:13] companies publicly listed energy
[43:15] companies. They booked some trainings.
[43:17] We did some analyzis about possible
[43:21] container setting up at their uh sites.
[43:24] And now one year later or one and a half
[43:26] years later, they get back to us. Yeah,
[43:28] now we're ready. And it's a sentiment
[43:30] thing. I guess it's not that they're
[43:31] that they know anything more or have
[43:33] more money than last year. It's it's all
[43:36] about sentiment. And now they're all
[43:38] coming back and back and we're and we
[43:40] are very happy about that. Yeah. And and
[43:43] I also wanted to point out the the the
[43:46] great lab that you are having in in in
[43:48] Oxburg. I really have to go there
[43:50] finally. I told you you're definitely
[43:53] invited to look at it. I I have I think
[43:56] it would be also great to look at it and
[43:59] make a small video around it. Uh because
[44:02] I think um we talk a lot about um
[44:05] Bitcoin mining. We talk a lot about all
[44:07] those developments, but actually seeing
[44:09] it, I know I haven't seen a lot of
[44:13] miners in real life in all my life. And
[44:16] I'm someone that does a podcast every
[44:18] day about Bitcoin. So imagine someone
[44:21] that is barely getting started with
[44:23] Bitcoin or like a little bit earlier in
[44:25] the journey, still has some Bitcoin but
[44:27] listens to some podcast. I think really
[44:29] seeing those devices and how this works
[44:31] and getting it explained by experts. I
[44:33] think that would be something that I
[44:36] have to mark down finally on some
[44:38] calendar like hey I'll I'll drive to
[44:40] Munich and and go there and then and
[44:42] then and we make a small small vlog out
[44:44] of it. So yeah, I'll definitely take you
[44:46] up on that offer. Um I mean you have to
[44:50] imagine there there are guests coming
[44:52] over and book those trainings, those
[44:54] energy lab tours. they drive for hours
[44:57] because I always try to make it possible
[44:59] to be there in person. Unfortunately, I
[45:03] I can't make it each and every time.
[45:05] It's it's always Friday afternoon. Um
[45:09] but when I'm here, I always ask the
[45:11] question, where are you coming from? And
[45:15] it is it is crazy. People flying in,
[45:18] people driving hours and hours by car to
[45:21] visit us. And now, this is also very
[45:23] interesting. One year ago it was more
[45:26] like the owners the CEOs that's like
[45:28] okay let let's do that I I have to visit
[45:31] this company and look at it by myself to
[45:33] see the technology now even middle
[45:36] management and and I mean that in a
[45:38] positive way sea level they get sent as
[45:42] a business trip paid all expenses by
[45:44] their company like the pump companies
[45:46] the solar companies the electricity
[45:49] companies grid providers the operating
[45:52] companies but also because we also to
[45:54] offer as you know the services around
[45:57] the hash power in Finland. Maybe we talk
[45:58] about that as well because these are
[46:00] these are very important pioneering role
[46:03] model projects. We have to bring this
[46:05] technology to Germany and the D region
[46:08] in general. But this is also a shift
[46:12] that they get sent by their companies as
[46:15] a business trip. And sometimes, and it's
[46:18] fascinating, we as as as speakers or
[46:21] trainers, sometimes we don't even have
[46:24] to
[46:24] argue or explain something because when
[46:27] you have 10 people from all over Europe
[46:29] coming over and we're having these
[46:31] discussions and the trainings, sometimes
[46:34] they talk to each other and they
[46:36] exchange their contact details. Hey,
[46:37] let's stay in touch and very
[46:39] interesting. So, this is where the magic
[46:41] happens, right?
[46:43] this is uh you just bring the right
[46:45] people together and and it makes sense
[46:47] and I definitely want to get to this
[46:49] Finland project. Uh and but maybe first
[46:52] let's get started with uh how do you
[46:55] look at solo mining and and people
[46:57] mining for themselves just to have like
[46:59] one small rig running one uh solo miner
[47:03] maybe it's even just a bit that they
[47:05] have running how do you look at uh
[47:07] mining yourself in I don't know garage
[47:08] or anything like that we focus for many
[47:11] reasons on bigger large scale mining
[47:15] operations like starting from 20 50 kow
[47:20] 100 kilowatts for businesses. So, so
[47:22] business-to- business solutions, but
[47:24] there's
[47:25] definitely and that would also be part
[47:28] of of my dream dream vision for the
[47:30] future obviously that every one and and
[47:33] every citizen in Germany, in Europe, all
[47:35] over the
[47:36] world mines Bitcoin. And there are some
[47:38] developments not only around Bitex and
[47:40] Nerd Miner, what I love, greetings go
[47:43] out to Julio's, great guy. Um but also
[47:47] like all these things people uh people
[47:50] talk about that that you will at some
[47:52] point in time have have your chip in
[47:54] your toaster more or less or have your
[47:56] Bitcoin mining chip running in your car
[47:59] or whatever that might be something that
[48:01] is interesting. Solo mining is very
[48:04] interesting as an educational tool
[48:06] obviously and
[48:08] also in the retail sector um when you
[48:12] have your own little solar production on
[48:16] your roof and I don't know what the
[48:18] future holds and brings. I mean we have
[48:20] we have these uh uh virtual power plants
[48:24] um and those service providers in
[48:26] Germany they're very successful like uh
[48:30] Eincom and NPAL for for private uh the
[48:34] private sector. So power contracts and
[48:37] when everyone when everybody integrates
[48:40] batteries into their homes might also be
[48:43] interesting for for for private um for
[48:47] private sector. But we focus on
[48:49] businesses, portfolio managers and to
[48:52] bring hash power uh to funds and family
[48:55] family businesses
[48:57] um capital entities and in institutional
[49:02] investors because obviously when when
[49:04] you offer these packages uh and in
[49:08] mining in managed mining or hosted
[49:11] mining as it's the classic business is
[49:13] called it's about capex and it's about
[49:16] OPEX and And obviously it's more
[49:20] attractive when you buy more. This is
[49:22] this is like that in each and every
[49:24] business around the world I guess but to
[49:27] have your own small little rig or as a
[49:30] as a booster heating system at home and
[49:33] we also offer those very successfully 5
[49:37] kilowatt versions. Bitcoin heater for
[49:39] your home as a booster for your water
[49:43] for example also in spring and in autumn
[49:46] time. So this this is definitely um
[49:50] definitely interesting to get to know as
[49:52] you said earlier to get to know the
[49:54] technology as an educational tool and
[49:57] also to get Bitcoin at production cost.
[50:00] This is also something people have to
[50:02] understand that investing in Bitcoin
[50:04] mining is like a is like a passive
[50:06] savings plan into the future. you get
[50:09] exposure to Bitcoin in the future and it
[50:13] and it really depends what you what you
[50:15] think where the future is heading at
[50:18] where price-wise and and hash power wise
[50:21] and and it was always like that. I mean
[50:22] you have to imagine we are approaching
[50:25] or we are above one SA 2,000 thousand
[50:28] extra hashes and now when price
[50:31] doubles it is it is simply from a
[50:34] thermodynamic from from a physical
[50:36] standpoint not possible to double the
[50:40] amount of servers and and there and then
[50:43] obviously consequently hash power online
[50:46] in a short period of time. So there's
[50:48] always a time lag and and you can look
[50:50] at historical data three to six months
[50:54] where the hash power is not possible to
[50:57] catch up with the price movements and
[50:59] it's a very interesting time at the
[51:01] moment because I think personally #
[51:03] noinancial advice that we'll see these
[51:06] price
[51:07] movements and the hash power not
[51:10] catching up in the same period of time
[51:12] and also you don't need to uh use a
[51:16] classic exchange which might in some
[51:18] areas in the world also be very critical
[51:22] in the future.
[51:24] Some people also like the no KYC aspect
[51:27] of of of Bitcoin mining. I guess this is
[51:29] what you said. I said using or getting
[51:32] Bitcoin without exchanges which is the
[51:34] same thing obviously.
[51:37] I like that. Maybe it's a perfect segue
[51:40] into uh what are you doing in in in
[51:42] Finland and the project there? Uh, can
[51:44] you give us some some overview of like
[51:45] what what's planned for Finland?
[51:48] Yeah. What what are we doing there? You
[51:52] have to know my my vision, my dream for
[51:55] Germany, for Europe. And some people
[51:57] laugh about that and about me two or
[51:59] three years ago. Now, not that often
[52:01] anymore because it's it's becoming
[52:03] reality step by step. But my dream is to
[52:07] integrate Bitcoin mining into German and
[52:10] European grid systems. And some people
[52:12] say no that's not possible because it's
[52:14] also expensive in Germany. Yes, if you
[52:16] use all the electricity from the grid
[52:18] that might be the case in some places
[52:21] but I also believe that the economies of
[52:25] scale like bigger is better. What you
[52:27] see the gigawatt farms in Texas and so
[52:29] on and so on. At some point in time
[52:32] mining is getting more competitive each
[52:33] and every day. It's not going to be
[52:36] worth it anymore. And we see that the
[52:38] publicly listed miners they have their
[52:39] problems. They have they have their
[52:41] problems when you look at their
[52:42] efficiency of their fleets a lot a lot
[52:46] above average. It's not it's not even
[52:50] close when you look at the newest
[52:52] generations of mining equipment and also
[52:54] the mining equipment we use in Finland
[52:57] and we offer to our investors and
[52:59] partners um we're looking at 15 or 17
[53:03] watts per terahash what what you need to
[53:07] produce one terraash and the fleets of
[53:09] the publicly companies are
[53:11] 25 27 or 30 so double inefficiency
[53:15] because they're older and older and then
[53:17] when when prices get more and more
[53:19] competitive. Even electricity prices of
[53:22] 5 cent or 4 cent or $3 cents, what they
[53:25] have in in the states is not enough
[53:27] anymore. You need other revenue streams.
[53:30] Grid balancing, okay, they have that in
[53:32] the air system in Texas, but also reuse
[53:35] the heat. And you cannot use all of this
[53:37] heat in one place in Texas. It needs to
[53:40] be decentralized. And that is what we're
[53:41] doing in Finland. We work together
[53:43] closely with grid operators, the local
[53:46] grid grid operators. And when what we do
[53:49] there, we have one data center already
[53:52] online since September. Very successful.
[53:54] We mind by ourselves, but obviously also
[53:57] we have some partners also in there,
[54:00] investors that are part of our mining
[54:03] operation and but but also starting from
[54:07] 10 machines. So not one machine retail
[54:09] investor starting with 10 machines
[54:11] because we want to offer premium
[54:13] services to our professional partners
[54:15] and investors and now um we are setting
[54:18] up a second site in Finland. It's the
[54:21] same concept uh 1.7 megapawatt so even
[54:25] double in size and we're very proud to
[54:27] call it and this is what other industry
[54:29] experts say to us that maybe we have the
[54:33] most modern Bitcoin mining site in the
[54:35] world there at the moment because we
[54:38] integrate grid balancing and we also
[54:40] have a partner there local Finnish
[54:42] partner and he he really did his
[54:46] research and constructed an an own
[54:48] system perfectly fit fitting with
[54:51] professional components for district
[54:54] heating because it's a difference
[54:56] between okay we have containers for
[54:58] excess heat we can do that and we can do
[55:01] that very good with some of our partners
[55:03] also from China but then district
[55:06] heating where you have your PPA
[55:08] contracts and uh you have to uh uh you
[55:11] you you have compliance and stuff like
[55:13] that and you and you even have payments
[55:16] when you when you are not able uh uh you
[55:19] you get fined and stuff like that and
[55:21] this equipment is high-end and it's and
[55:23] it's it's premium equipment what we have
[55:26] there in Finland. And my dream is now to
[55:30] to not even develop even more of those
[55:33] projects and sites in Finland. We can do
[55:35] that. We can develop a 4 megawatt site
[55:38] in autumn. We can develop 20, 30, 50
[55:41] megawatts in the upcoming years there in
[55:43] Finland because our partner wants to
[55:45] work with us together because he can
[55:46] trust us. This is a huge is issue in
[55:49] mining to have serious long-term
[55:51] partnerships because there's still lots
[55:53] of scam going on. We could talk for
[55:56] hours about o only this thing the the
[55:59] huge scam of Bitcoin mining or in
[56:01] Bitcoin mining, but this is another
[56:02] episode, I guess. and and and not only
[56:07] are we going to willing to develop the
[56:09] Finnish market, the European market with
[56:12] European investors, but also to bring
[56:16] this technology, this made in Europe,
[56:18] Finnish technology, these container
[56:20] setups with our Finnish partner to
[56:23] Germany, to Europe into local district
[56:27] heating uh setups.
[56:30] That's super interesting. And you talked
[56:32] about the the partners that are involved
[56:35] there. I think like 10 machines and
[56:37] above. So like partners and investors
[56:39] are just people or companies that say,
[56:41] "Hey, I want to be part of that project
[56:43] and I buy 10 machines or more of that
[56:47] thing." So, so in general, if you if you
[56:49] give a short impression about that, we
[56:51] have funds, we have family, we have
[56:53] family offices, we have operating
[56:55] companies from all over Europe. We have
[56:58] some some from Switzerland and
[57:00] Likenstein, but also we have inquiries.
[57:03] So, people want to to invest in Finland.
[57:05] They're coming from Brazil, Zingapore,
[57:08] and the States. And you have to imagine
[57:09] why is that? Where where are the main
[57:12] mining mining hotspots in the world? It
[57:14] was Paraguay. It was it was Ethiopia but
[57:18] obviously South America and Africa when
[57:21] it comes to regulation bribes and so
[57:24] there's many things there going on I can
[57:27] tell you we we have all the experience
[57:29] so many many investors say okay that's
[57:31] not something for me so there's one
[57:33] thing left it's the states and normally
[57:36] would say yeah Bitcoin mining in the
[57:37] states Trump let's do this let's go but
[57:40] then you have the import tariffs so what
[57:43] happens at the moment is that mining
[57:45] rigs the servers are not available or if
[57:48] if it's available it's it's more
[57:51] expensive. So at the moment this is also
[57:53] not only because of um technological
[57:56] reasons but also when when we look at
[57:59] the pricing of our Finnish offering also
[58:02] this might be premium and the best
[58:04] offering at the moment worldwide. So
[58:06] this is very interesting, very
[58:07] interesting dynamic and I would never
[58:09] looked at that like this because we
[58:11] think yeah America and mining in the
[58:13] states with a mining hotspot. Yeah,
[58:16] maybe maybe in the future but at the
[58:18] moment they have lots of challenges
[58:20] there as well which benefits our Finnish
[58:23] offerings. Interesting. And there uh I
[58:27] mean there are so it's it's more of
[58:29] um is it like hosted mining for those
[58:33] investors? So they buy the the mining
[58:35] rigs and they they get a percentage of
[58:36] of of the the payout. We have we have
[58:40] started with the classic we don't call
[58:43] it hosted mining but managed money but
[58:45] but it's more or less the same. We we
[58:48] call it the buy and host offering. This
[58:50] is what we started with. But then it's
[58:52] so interesting and this is what we
[58:54] always do when when I look at services
[58:56] and business model to to
[58:58] to develop it even further. Not only
[59:01] offer that what everyone offers. So we
[59:04] talk to investors and they have their
[59:06] problems to buy machines because they
[59:08] get an invoice for machines and then
[59:10] there's taxes on it but on it for
[59:12] example and and as a business or as as a
[59:16] bank as private banks we also have
[59:17] private banks who want to invest in and
[59:19] go this way down with us in Finland.
[59:22] It's not possible to get the tax back.
[59:25] So what they need to have is is is is an
[59:28] instrument
[59:30] um a balance sheet instrument and that's
[59:32] what we've de developed over the last
[59:35] three or four uh months. It's it's a
[59:37] company structure. It's a so-called SPV
[59:40] special purpose vehicle. And with this
[59:42] SPV, this SPV is the owner and holds the
[59:46] servers and the Bitcoin. This this is by
[59:49] the way also interesting for German
[59:50] electricity companies because they don't
[59:52] want to have Bitcoin on their balance
[59:54] sheets. So they also looking into our
[59:56] SPV structure because then the SPV is
[59:59] the owner and holds the servers and we
[60:02] operate as the CEO of this SPV. We
[60:06] operate the servers and and and are in
[60:09] charge of high uptime and this and that.
[60:11] So this is this is another offering
[60:13] where we even uh where we even develop
[60:16] the service even further away from
[60:18] classic hosting because we don't want to
[60:20] be a hosting company.
[60:23] Interesting. So a company can now buy
[60:26] just another company which they are used
[60:28] to like a part of of of that uh company
[60:31] and they can even create their own
[60:33] bitcoin mining company. So you have to
[60:36] imagine that if if they want to include
[60:39] for example three mining sites in their
[60:42] own Bitcoin mining SPV then they can do
[60:44] that because we have all the contacts we
[60:46] have the network we can say okay
[60:48] investor you want to invest uh 1 million
[60:51] or 2 million or 5 million and you want
[60:53] to be involved in Finland you want to be
[60:55] involved in the states and also in in
[60:57] Ethiopia then this is also possible
[60:59] through this structure and they are part
[61:02] owner or even own the the 100% owner of
[61:05] their own SPV. And this is something
[61:08] this is so this is so funny. I always
[61:12] translate things and business models
[61:14] from the old from the old legacy economy
[61:17] only into Bitcoin and then it works for
[61:19] magical reasons. And this SPV structure,
[61:22] it is so common in renewable energy.
[61:24] When you look at wind parks and solar,
[61:26] it's so common in Germany and it's also
[61:27] very common in real estate. when Germany
[61:31] got reunited back in 1990 1991 and so on
[61:34] and so on lots of real estate
[61:36] development going on over there with
[61:38] this type of SPV structure and now we're
[61:41] only adapting this very common very
[61:44] known model by investors all over the
[61:47] world to the bitcoin and bitcoin mining
[61:51] sector interesting uh so just so that
[61:54] that I get it right this is more towards
[61:58] uh high net of individuals and
[62:00] companies. So like corporate entities.
[62:03] Yes. Okay. So like not a retail product.
[62:06] Is there anything that that you plan for
[62:08] like retail folks and maybe want to
[62:09] invest like 5 10,000? This is a very
[62:12] good question and um I have a I have a
[62:15] life philosophy since I met Bitcoin and
[62:17] or I knew about Bitcoin and my life
[62:20] philosophy is not exclude anything. That
[62:24] doesn't mean say yes to everything. You
[62:26] understand? Not exclude anything. So I
[62:29] will not exclude this as well to offer
[62:31] anything for retail investors in the
[62:33] future. But at the moment we're are
[62:35] focusing um on on businesses and
[62:39] starting from 10 machines and
[62:41] professional investors because you have
[62:42] to imagine and this is also feedback we
[62:44] got several times by banks funds but
[62:48] also by other investors, portfolio
[62:50] managers, asset managers. There's money
[62:53] around the corner. have hundreds of
[62:55] millions that go into so-called
[62:58] infrastructure
[63:00] funds or alternative investment funds.
[63:03] These are the terms, the buzzwords. And
[63:06] for many years and it was amazing for
[63:09] those entities to invest in wind and
[63:11] solar power because of all the
[63:13] subsidies, German government and so on
[63:16] and so on. So the return on investment
[63:18] was was was amazing for the for those
[63:21] companies. But now it's all over. It's
[63:24] all over. And this is what you see and
[63:26] find during those trade fairs. What do
[63:28] we do with our electricity? We have so
[63:30] much
[63:31] electricity. And this is
[63:33] also real for those alternative
[63:36] investment funds and uh for those
[63:38] renewable energy funds, ESG funds,
[63:42] innovative technology funds, uh data
[63:45] center funds. So there's so much capital
[63:48] billions in Europe that needs to needs
[63:51] to be invested and cannot be invested
[63:53] into Bitcoin because this is the
[63:55] question I always get. Why should I
[63:57] invest into Bitcoin mining when I also
[63:59] can buy Bitcoin? And I always say buy
[64:01] Bitcoin but also do the other thing. Do
[64:03] both. It's important to have your own
[64:05] hash power. Interesting. So, so, uh, is
[64:09] actually funny enough, I wanted to ask
[64:11] you right now this question about, uh,
[64:14] retail people, uh, mining versus buying
[64:18] because like the most people say, oh,
[64:20] like just buy Bitcoin because mining
[64:22] it's like not as as profitable as just
[64:24] like buying the straight out Bitcoin.
[64:26] How do you look at mining versus buying?
[64:29] I would go and when when you did listen
[64:32] carefully what I what I just said, I
[64:34] would go so far to say professional
[64:37] mining is not something for retail
[64:39] investors. I would go this I would go
[64:41] this far when you use it for heating or
[64:43] as an educational tool to get to know
[64:46] the technology. I mean people set up
[64:48] their own full nodes. I did that as well
[64:50] when I when I got into Bitcoin and and
[64:52] and you tried this and that with with
[64:54] lightning and lightning nodes. So please
[64:57] buy your mining equipment as well. I I
[65:00] mean some people buy their gaming u
[65:03] gaming equipment as well or nice cars
[65:05] and those things or they go into nice
[65:07] they go on a nice holiday those things
[65:10] don't have return on investment. These
[65:12] are memories and sometimes memories are
[65:14] priceless as we all know. Um but for me
[65:18] uh especially in Germany that might
[65:20] shift but especially in Germany when you
[65:22] look at having your Bitcoin tax-free
[65:25] after 12 months that is a huge argument
[65:28] that is a huge argument and you cannot
[65:30] beat it with and with mining but there
[65:34] are several cases when you look at
[65:35] historical data but this is only true
[65:39] when you have good pricing good
[65:41] conditions. So this most of the time
[65:43] applies for professional investors in in
[65:46] four out of six cases. Bull market, bare
[65:49] market, mining even beats a buy and hold
[65:52] strategy. But it depends on many many it
[65:55] depends on many many aspects. Like for
[65:58] example, do you pay your electricity or
[66:00] service fee bill with your Bitcoin or do
[66:03] you pay your bill with excess fiat money
[66:06] that gets in even more into the system?
[66:08] And then we even had we even had
[66:10] customers like calculating the the the
[66:14] fees they had to pay in fiat in euro for
[66:18] example compared to when they would save
[66:20] in bitcoin in the future. And this is
[66:22] not how it works for me. But but but
[66:25] this is something um we explain uh in
[66:28] our workshops and our consultancy and
[66:31] then we say okay is it interesting for
[66:33] you or or should you buy Bitcoin?
[66:36] because then we're always uh brutally
[66:38] honest. This is very important for me
[66:39] and and transparent as well. How do you
[66:42] look
[66:43] at companies that now do offer those
[66:46] retail hosted mining facilities? Uh like
[66:50] I think abundant mines, simple mining
[66:54] like there are many of those. Yeah, for
[66:56] some it might work, but the question is
[67:00] does it work for the company that offers
[67:03] the service to finance their own mining
[67:05] operation? Because this is most of the
[67:07] time the goal the goal for all those
[67:09] hosted mining companies and I don't want
[67:12] to lie. I also want to mine more but we
[67:15] don't have the funding and the financing
[67:18] uh yet because this is another challenge
[67:20] to talk to classic legacy banks and say
[67:23] hey I need financing for server
[67:25] equipment in Finland. They're like okay
[67:27] why because normally you need injection
[67:29] molding machines here in Bavaria or some
[67:32] other type of machinery and Saxony and
[67:34] now Finland we have a new site there. So
[67:37] financing is a topic but to come back to
[67:39] your question I would be very cautious
[67:42] about retail hosted mining. Yeah really
[67:46] really cool. It's it's also probably
[67:48] gets quick in the thing that you said
[67:50] before of like look out for scams in the
[67:54] Bitcoin mining
[67:56] industry I guess. Yeah. Really cool. Um
[67:59] one more thing uh before we get to the
[68:02] end routine. What do you think is the
[68:03] biggest catalyst that you that you see
[68:07] for Bitcoin adoption? I think I believe
[68:11] it's going to be not will be it's going
[68:14] to be a
[68:16] combination and it's going to be a
[68:19] combination that can happen very very
[68:21] quickly. I don't know what happens
[68:23] behind closed doors if they talk to each
[68:25] other like huge
[68:27] companies the the magnificent seven
[68:30] talking to each other coming out at the
[68:33] same time or whatever. I don't know. I
[68:35] don't know. It's a combin It's a
[68:37] combination between and and you have to
[68:39] and you have to imagine we have the
[68:41] first sovereign wealth funds of Norway
[68:43] and Abu Dhabi investing into Bitcoin on
[68:47] a huge huge scale. We have Charles
[68:49] Schwab coming in. we have this and that
[68:52] happen and we might see 5x or 10x sooner
[68:56] than we think when all of these things
[68:59] come together and this is the catalyst
[69:01] when when the price goes to 200 300
[69:03] 400,000 then and this is what I don't
[69:06] know if this is also something you would
[69:08] agree on that there are companies and
[69:11] and and billions billions of dollars in
[69:14] euros waiting
[69:17] sidelined for the volatility to decrease
[69:20] increase because those asset managers,
[69:22] they don't want to lose their
[69:23] job and they get paid for like safe
[69:27] return on investment, safe yield and and
[69:29] so on and so on and and I believe that I
[69:32] I really believe that that there's money
[69:34] they completely understand Bitcoin
[69:36] completely down the rabbit hole
[69:38] privately definitely completely
[69:41] leveraged inside of Bitcoin but on a
[69:43] professional company level there's like
[69:45] okay I can do that in two years in three
[69:48] is even though I will not make a 10x
[69:52] from there to 1 million from 100,000 to
[69:54] 1 million only a two or 3x to 1 million
[69:57] then but for me it's more safe uh less
[70:01] volatility and so on and so on would you
[70:04] agree on that I agree 100% with that and
[70:07] I I speak about that sometimes it's that
[70:11] suddenly moment when the career risk
[70:13] flips for CEOs and CFOs because there
[70:17] are so many people out there that get
[70:20] Bitcoin privately but are really afraid
[70:23] because they're in a CFO position. Um
[70:25] they get Bitcoin, they know the next 5
[70:28] years it's a good strategy but what if
[70:30] they implement that they have one year
[70:33] all of the sudden in bare market and all
[70:36] of the sudden there's like a board
[70:37] coming saying like hey like why did you
[70:38] do that and they lose their job. So the
[70:41] the career risk is right now at the
[70:43] moment where maybe you lose your job if
[70:46] you implement Bitcoin but I think the
[70:48] career risk will flip at some point. We
[70:50] could be on brink on the brink of
[70:53] flipping as you said and and then then
[70:55] it will be really interesting because
[70:57] then all of a sudden all the CFOs and
[70:59] CEOs have to ask answer the question why
[71:03] didn't you do anything with Bitcoin and
[71:05] what is your Bitcoin strategy now and
[71:07] then all of the sudden we have that uh
[71:09] domino effect of the career risk
[71:12] flipping the the awakening or like
[71:14] however you want to call it but isn't it
[71:16] ironic I mean you have to imagine now
[71:19] we're going into the future. There's the
[71:21] CFO CEO and everyone everyone knows he's
[71:24] a hardcore Bitcoiner in his private life
[71:27] and then Bitcoin goes to 1 million. He's
[71:31] completely lost. Didn't do anything. No
[71:34] Bitcoin on on the balance sheets are
[71:36] saving in Bitcoin. Then he has to answer
[71:38] the question, hey, you're the expert for
[71:41] so many years. Why didn't you do it? Now
[71:44] we're at 1 million, you know. And then
[71:46] he loses and then he also loses his job
[71:48] but because of other reasons.
[71:51] That's an interesting perspective. I
[71:53] never looked at that because they say,
[71:54] "Hey, you bought Bitcoin privately. You
[71:57] profited from Bitcoin but you didn't do
[71:59] it for the company and you're the CFO.
[72:00] You have a responsibility. Please CFO um
[72:04] you can give me now your private
[72:06] Bitcoin. We will integrate that into our
[72:08] balance sheet and then you have nothing
[72:11] left." Ah, really interesting. Good
[72:14] deal. Good deal.
[72:15] Um we have an end routine in the podcast
[72:18] of two questions. The first question is
[72:19] always the same question for each uh
[72:22] guest and the question is what can we
[72:23] learn from you besides Bitcoin? What can
[72:26] that's a that's a very good question. I
[72:27] got many question got many questions the
[72:30] meaning of life and stuff like that what
[72:32] you can learn from from me. Yeah. First
[72:34] of all, the philosophy that you're
[72:37] always stay open to new things, be
[72:40] interested in new things, never exclude
[72:43] anything. Um, this this is very
[72:45] important, I guess. And also, what can
[72:48] you learn? There's always a way because
[72:50] sometimes I get the question, hey, you
[72:52] you already had three companies and and
[72:55] uh and uh three kids at home, small
[72:58] small kids at home. Why are you so crazy
[73:01] founding another company? and and I back
[73:04] in the day and this was the bare market
[73:06] summer of 200 was it 22 hardcore bare
[73:11] market 2022 when we got got down to
[73:14] 15,000 this is when I all of the time
[73:18] talked to my wife like should I should I
[73:21] uh start a company in in the Bitcoin
[73:23] space should I do it should I not do it
[73:25] and she's like you will do it why are
[73:27] you why are you asking me so sometimes
[73:29] you have to believe in yourself and
[73:31] there's there's destiny involved or fate
[73:34] involved, but also and I see that
[73:37] now to have a startup and I'm invited at
[73:41] my old school where I did my high school
[73:43] degree. They invited me to talk about my
[73:45] startup story and about Bitcoin in in
[73:47] front of kids, young adults. So, this is
[73:49] this is going to be amazing, but also a
[73:51] huge responsibility. What do I tell
[73:53] them? And and I will tell them be a
[73:55] sovereign individual. don't believe
[73:58] everything what you hear and see on
[74:01] television on on media. Um and also when
[74:06] you when you follow your dreams you need
[74:10] time and as some people call it grit
[74:13] persistence over long periods of time
[74:15] and it takes time. It took three years
[74:17] now with Terra to build the structures
[74:20] the processes the products and you need
[74:22] an amazing team. I have an amazing team.
[74:24] Rachel, Fabi, Matias, all of these
[74:26] people, amazing team. And then when the
[74:29] market is ready and the sentiment
[74:30] shifts, you're ready. When when the
[74:33] sentiment shifts and then you start a
[74:34] company or address an issue, you're too
[74:38] late. So, timing obviously is important,
[74:41] but also
[74:42] grit. I love that. Really, really cool.
[74:46] The the the philosophy of of of doing
[74:48] things and not excluding things. That's
[74:50] I guess that philosophy led you
[74:52] ultimately to Bitcoin because you did
[74:54] not exclude it uh and you actually gave
[74:56] it a fair shot at looking at it. Um we
[74:59] have an end routine where the previous
[75:01] guest is asking a question for the next
[75:02] guest without knowing who the next guest
[75:04] actually is and he asked you the
[75:06] question if you could only select one
[75:08] condom piece book podcast episode video
[75:11] or picture or whatever to orange build a
[75:13] world which one would you pick? It needs
[75:15] to be something that is
[75:18] quite quite basic for lots and lots of
[75:22] people. I love um element zero from York
[75:27] Ham. I love this guy where he talk about
[75:30] the elements in life and in nature and
[75:33] that Bitcoin is element zero but it's
[75:35] maybe too hard for beginners and
[75:36] starters.
[75:38] What I really love and it and it was
[75:40] very important for me and my process uh
[75:44] to to get to know and to learn about
[75:47] Bitcoin is the keynote by Alex Fonfrang
[75:51] and I also got to know him and he's a
[75:53] friend of mine Alex Fonfang from from
[75:55] the from Hi-Tech Grinder in Germany and
[75:58] he has this keynote at the network
[76:01] effect the netswag effect and and it
[76:04] opened my eyes what happens in networks
[76:07] and when the network effect kicks in and
[76:10] you have this protocol base layer and
[76:13] you build the city the skyscrapers on
[76:15] top of it and he explained that the
[76:17] skyscrapers when you when you look at
[76:18] the internet the skyscrapers obviously
[76:21] Google Microsoft and so on and so on
[76:24] Apple uh it's the same with the mobile
[76:27] phone and so I would say the network
[76:29] effect Alex from Fang back amazing I
[76:32] love that really really cool then thank
[76:33] you so much uh Chris for for being on on
[76:36] the podcast before I let you Where can
