[00:00] stop waiting for Bitcoin to become a
[00:02] million stop thinking in Fiat terms you
[00:04] need to learn how to build on bitcoin
[00:06] altcoins are building wooden Shacks they
[00:09] can build it fast but it's going to fly
[00:12] away with the first high wind none of us
[00:14] know what Bitcoin is just because it was
[00:16] meant to be money that doesn't mean it's
[00:18] only that detoxicate yourself from the
[00:20] proof of stake thinking and start
[00:22] thinking what can I give bu on bitcoin
[00:24] because those experiences will be
[00:27] impossible on the fat infrastructure and
[00:29] that's how we transition into this new
[00:31] life Noster is a big opportunity
[00:34] especially for content to create do you
[00:35] think that the whole internet and all
[00:38] the communications will be at some point
[00:40] PE on Nostra Noster will be the new
[00:43] internet the internet that has native
[00:45] money nobody can stop you from joining
[00:48] Noster nobody can stop you from building
[00:50] on
[00:51] [Music]
[00:54] bitcoin actually none of us know what
[00:57] Bitcoin is none of us uh
[01:00] uh just because it was meant to be money
[01:03] uh that doesn't mean it's only that it's
[01:05] just like saying a human is a mammal or
[01:09] a human is somebody that walks on two
[01:11] legs it's just so much more complex
[01:14] thing just like Bitcoin and you can say
[01:18] it's a heating system you can say it's
[01:20] an electrical system you can say it's
[01:21] money you can say it's to of value you
[01:23] can say cyber security all those are
[01:26] true and it is in one thing but if you
[01:29] are stuck in in one uh description
[01:31] you're going to miss all the others and
[01:34] just like you if you bring those new
[01:37] voices they can put in that new point of
[01:40] view of this new reality and that keeps
[01:43] it fresh because kind of regurgitating
[01:47] what uh the big voices say in a
[01:50] different matter is not enough at this
[01:53] point because Bitcoin is outgrowing the
[01:57] Mone even at this stage uh I'm talking
[02:00] about the people that really understand
[02:02] it obviously people don't even consider
[02:04] it as money yet the majority but the
[02:08] people that build uh I love how the
[02:11] mining industry is now trying to
[02:14] research what is more valuable the
[02:17] electricity providing to the people or
[02:20] the money that we are going to get in a
[02:21] form of Bitcoin and that Dynamic I I
[02:24] love it uh and if you say oh Bitcoin is
[02:27] just money and you um and you apply uh
[02:32] sort of value type of oh I'm going to
[02:34] buy this and nothing else you're going
[02:36] to miss on the Living Part like you use
[02:39] it as money as a medium of Exchange in
[02:42] all of those properties but if you don't
[02:44] focus on your personal um life what do
[02:48] you actually want to accomplish with
[02:50] Bitcoin and that's why I really love the
[02:53] podcast and those new guests because
[02:56] they bring their personal stories even
[02:58] if they don't think on a global level
[03:01] thank you so much appreciate it a lot
[03:03] and I mean that's the perfect segue
[03:05] actually in our topic like so let's just
[03:07] right start right into it um why like
[03:11] first of all like why do you think that
[03:14] we uh need to build on bitcoin more than
[03:17] just money like why is Bitcoin more than
[03:20] just I mean just money like money itself
[03:22] is an amazing use case and if Bitcoin
[03:26] would be just the just the money of the
[03:28] earth it would be gig gantic but why is
[03:30] it more than that uh I would say yeah
[03:34] the the real value I Really Love U Alex
[03:38] glin that
[03:40] the use case of money that Bitcoin gives
[03:44] the value that we never had is that it's
[03:47] money that nobody can control nobody can
[03:51] capture even if they try they're going
[03:54] to get wrecked it's going to be
[03:55] something temporarily and because For
[03:58] the First time ever there there is not
[04:01] going to be a 1% in Bitcoin yeah people
[04:04] will take advantage people will provide
[04:06] value but the majority will win at any
[04:11] centralization point because now the
[04:14] majority uh has the power of one person
[04:18] one vult one node one vote and that
[04:22] supersedes everything else uh right now
[04:26] everything is getting captured obviously
[04:28] because of the money but it's this
[04:33] disbalance because the 1% has so much
[04:37] more power than the 95 or the
[04:43] 99% because that
[04:45] one% uh has that enormous power the
[04:50] majority does not have the same power
[04:52] and in the Bitcoin is a reverse that
[04:55] that value that the majority will out
[04:58] power out comp repat the minority if the
[05:02] minority is not um uh valuable for the
[05:07] whole society obviously if somebody
[05:10] provides enormous value to all of
[05:13] society we don't mind it but if somebody
[05:16] abuses that power now for the first time
[05:19] majority can fight back against it now
[05:23] we can fight back because we just don't
[05:25] have the power we all of us are getting
[05:27] captured and because now we have that
[05:32] power we just need to realize how to use
[05:36] it and that's why I say that you need to
[05:38] learn how to build on bitcoin because if
[05:40] you just um I said that previously that
[05:45] um we are so used to this proof of stake
[05:48] thinking in the Fiat system uh in the
[05:51] whole stock uh the Central Bank wants to
[05:54] print money and give you something for
[05:56] nothing uh the technology companies get
[06:00] captured and with their stocks want to
[06:02] give you something for nothing and
[06:04] through the whole stock for the person
[06:06] that is an employee wants to receive
[06:09] their salary monthly and doesn't want to
[06:12] do any work which is again F uh proof of
[06:16] stake like the time is going to pass
[06:18] anyway so I don't want to do any work
[06:21] and if you actually build on bitcoin
[06:23] that is a completely reverse people that
[06:26] actually build on bitcoin and not just
[06:28] use it as proof of stake oh I have one
[06:31] Bitcoin so I'm set for the rest of my
[06:33] life just continue Pro to provide value
[06:37] and uh the really beautiful thing that I
[06:41] love in Bitcoin is that now for the
[06:43] first time ever you can chase the life
[06:45] that you want to have and not uh pray
[06:51] beg ask anybody for it it's your
[06:54] personal choice if you're going to do it
[06:57] if you just stack SS and don't build on
[07:00] bitcoin yeah you have something but
[07:03] you'll always say oh I should have
[07:05] bought more oh now I should have sold
[07:07] because the price is this or that and
[07:09] this is just uh detoxicate yourself from
[07:13] the uh proof of stake thinking and start
[07:15] thinking what can I give and what am I
[07:18] chasing what do I want to do and just
[07:22] use Bitcoin as the best vehicle to
[07:24] achieve it I also love the the saying
[07:27] that uh don't ask what Bitcoin can do
[07:30] for you but ask what you can do for
[07:32] Bitcoin and this includes for me like
[07:34] doing something for the ecosystem and
[07:36] obviously there are so many different
[07:37] parts what you can do like I just try to
[07:39] do my podcast and try to bring out so
[07:42] many new voices and also bring out all
[07:45] the the great voices that we already
[07:46] have heard um but you can also build
[07:50] actually on bitcoin which is really
[07:52] exciting um and then there's this topic
[07:55] for me that's really interesting uh with
[07:57] altcoins there are like so many altcoins
[08:00] out there and they
[08:02] all when I meet someone that has an
[08:04] altcoin or that promotes an altcoin it
[08:07] always goes something like this oh yeah
[08:09] I have this one altcoin which is
[08:12] superior to bitcoin because of that one
[08:15] feature uh and this is always like yeah
[08:18] but you don't have the other 72 things
[08:20] that you actually need to have something
[08:22] solid here um do the first question is
[08:26] do we need to build those use cases uh
[08:30] that altcoins have onto
[08:32] Bitcoin uh and if there are use cases
[08:35] from altcoins that you see that would be
[08:37] valuable on bitcoin will they all be
[08:40] built on bitcoin and then like maybe a
[08:42] third questions in there um do you then
[08:45] see all altcoins eventually going to
[08:47] zero when uh Bitcoin can build
[08:50] everything uh on
[08:52] there uh I I don't know in the very long
[08:57] future when we go to the bit coin
[08:59] standard because I think a lot of
[09:01] numbers that are currently used are
[09:05] going to um get captured by Bitcoin uh
[09:10] so they're going to get in this open
[09:13] ecosystem for example
[09:15] currently uh there are loyalty programs
[09:18] yeah let's say in stores in air miles in
[09:23] uh uh coffee shops everywhere because
[09:26] they can't print uh uh currency digits
[09:29] they print loyalty digits it's the same
[09:31] type of game like the thing but they are
[09:35] doing the same type of inflation game
[09:37] and in a big way the loyalty programs
[09:40] are like cbdcs they tell you oh you can
[09:43] use it in a this location you can't use
[09:46] it in a competitor but what actually
[09:49] stops those same uh
[09:52] loyalty points to be Bitcoin to be
[09:55] millets nothing actually stops them now
[09:58] because coin kind of gets to that point
[10:01] with whether it's with ecash whether
[10:03] it's with the lightning Network it
[10:04] doesn't matter another thing what stops
[10:07] all the video games that use Virtual uh
[10:11] soft currency and virtual hard currency
[10:14] uh in their uh games not nothing
[10:17] actually stops them to connect to the
[10:19] Bitcoin ecosystem and the kid that plays
[10:23] let's say uh I don't know which game but
[10:27] it has a currency in it to actually earn
[10:30] millets when it's a kid from 6 years old
[10:34] and can play a computer game and now can
[10:36] earn money and go buy food and it's a
[10:39] productive member of the whole society
[10:41] and it's in this open network and all of
[10:43] those Network effects will come into
[10:46] Bitcoin and all the uh I would say all
[10:51] the uh cases right now with out coins
[10:55] are kind of
[10:57] saying this let's say a faster
[11:00] transaction is more important than
[11:02] Incorruptible money or the Privacy
[11:06] aspect is more important than
[11:08] Incorruptible money and that's a flaw
[11:11] thinking whether they realize it or not
[11:14] that's a problem you just like uh if you
[11:18] say uh go and build massive biceps and
[11:21] the rest of the body is atrophying like
[11:24] you uh like you just have to look at the
[11:27] whole system not just just one feature
[11:30] yes that feature may be very important
[11:34] but is it
[11:35] important uh for the whole society right
[11:38] now and because Bitcoin is this
[11:41] Foundation that it's Incorruptible
[11:44] unless uh it's still incorruptable but
[11:48] the majority can decide if uh wants to
[11:51] change it and we can add all of those
[11:54] features to add to it
[11:57] obviously there might be some features
[12:00] that we can't put on bitcoin uh on the
[12:05] blockchain whether it's on the lightning
[12:07] Network we have to abstract some of
[12:10] those features in other layers or in
[12:13] other uh protocols I don't know but uh
[12:18] when we have this infinite time and uh
[12:23] incorruptibility we just need to build
[12:25] it and because uh altcoins are uh I
[12:30] think it like this metaphor that they're
[12:32] building wooden Shacks like they can
[12:35] build it fast but it's kind of um going
[12:40] to fly away with the first high wind but
[12:43] Bitcoin is this Cathedral just like the
[12:46] most famous One the Sada Familia it's
[12:49] built for more than 140 years because we
[12:54] have infinite time we need to have that
[12:57] thinking of building because if it is
[13:00] that important that feature we will
[13:02] build it but we come from the point of
[13:05] yes this is important not from I want to
[13:08] sell you something fast so I can win and
[13:12] you can
[13:13] lose a that's interesting um what do you
[13:16] say is the most interesting use case to
[13:19] build on on top of Bitcoin I mean
[13:21] obviously money but uh outside of money
[13:25] what do you see as an really interesting
[13:26] use case that we can build on top of
[13:28] Bitcoin uh I I I'm not exactly certain
[13:32] but uh uh of one particular use case
[13:37] because they're all fascinating but I'm
[13:40] really interested in how even me it's so
[13:46] hard to detach from the fear type of
[13:49] infrastructure and thinking that we
[13:51] currently live in just like the fish is
[13:53] swimming in the water and uh maybe they
[13:56] realize that they swim in water but is
[13:59] just this thing that they need and we're
[14:01] currently living in that Paradigm of uh
[14:05] uh Fe thinking in the really in the
[14:09] infrastructure and uh what I wanted to
[14:12] talk to you and that's why I reached out
[14:14] in the podcast is let's even take one
[14:17] aspect of the content creation uh and
[14:22] let's say currently the Fiat thinking if
[14:26] uh we want to analyze it right now if
[14:30] you're a
[14:30] podcaster to have income by it you may
[14:35] have sponsors or you may have people
[14:38] that pay you through this and you're
[14:40] taxed a lot uh whether it's by Google
[14:44] selling it or by the banking processors
[14:47] but a lot of things in the Fiat stack uh
[14:51] are stolen from you but let's analyze
[14:54] and maybe it can turn a a bit of a
[14:56] dialogue because you're really in this
[14:58] space uh let's analyze um a hardware
[15:03] wallet sponsor currently if uh they sell
[15:08] something through an influencer they
[15:10] usually give uh give them uh a code uh
[15:14] for a discount what does that actually
[15:17] mean that the real price of that uh
[15:22] product uh the hardware wallet is not
[15:26] actually the full price because they
[15:28] give this uh codes like candy and uh uh
[15:33] that means that the actual price of the
[15:36] device is not uh the full price but is
[15:40] the discounted price the other thing
[15:44] because uh they're discounting this and
[15:47] on top of that they're paying the
[15:50] influencers uh something so they can
[15:52] promote it obviously uh when it's talked
[15:57] on podcast they what they do actually
[16:00] want is sales but if you don't talk
[16:02] about their product nobody will buy it
[16:05] but uh because they're paying
[16:07] additionally that means that the actual
[16:10] price of the product is even lower if
[16:12] they actually sell it and on top of that
[16:17] when you pay the influencers nobody is
[16:20] going to uh pay let's say somebody that
[16:23] has uh 10 subscribers to their Channel
[16:27] because they don't want to waste money
[16:29] they want to put their money Mar
[16:31] marketing budget to good use so it could
[16:34] lead to sales uh and that kind of
[16:37] creates this centralization mechanism
[16:40] just because of this simple thing that
[16:42] we're talking about that they are a
[16:44] sponsor of a podcast and uh the bigger
[16:49] the podcast becomes uh the more money
[16:53] gives you and it kind of feed creates
[16:56] this virtual cycle that it creates more
[16:59] and more centralization the bigger the
[17:00] podcast that uh the more they are going
[17:02] to focus on that podcast to pay them and
[17:05] drop all the others so it's kind of
[17:08] creating this cycle of centralization
[17:10] just because of the Fiat payment
[17:13] structure of it but let's think in uh
[17:17] what we kind of glimpsed in my last
[17:19] episode with you what if we have a split
[17:23] payment for that that means that they
[17:27] give you a QR code and you negotiate not
[17:30] a marketing premium of talking about it
[17:33] but actual commission for sales and
[17:36] every time that somebody buys a hardware
[17:39] wallet through your personal QR code not
[17:42] a discounted but real value uh code you
[17:47] get let's say 10% competion split
[17:50] payment they get 90% or 15 or 20 doesn't
[17:54] matter but it's a direct commission they
[17:57] don't need to track any any numbers
[17:59] codes and stuff like that because the
[18:02] payment that you receive the 10% payment
[18:04] is the actual proof that the user boded
[18:07] through you so there's no accounting
[18:10] needed for that and not only that but
[18:13] the marketing budget for that Hardware
[18:15] wallet what is it zero absolute zero so
[18:21] anybody that has 10 subscribers to their
[18:25] channel can actually sell a hardware
[18:28] wallet because they don't need to pay
[18:30] them and if that Channel with 10
[18:33] subscribers they the highest
[18:35] quality uh viewers it could be 10 sales
[18:39] the podcaster is Happy the hardware
[18:43] manufacturer is Happy it gets increased
[18:46] and that actually creates competition
[18:49] and not centralization but that's just
[18:52] one point so let's uh give it to you if
[18:56] you disagree or something and we'll
[18:58] expand on this
[18:59] point I I don't disagree maybe I can
[19:02] share a lot of insights as I'm I'm
[19:04] working with with uh three Partners uh
[19:08] the the one partner I can always show
[19:10] physically that's like bitbox uh I can
[19:14] show them here the other one is uh the
[19:17] Bitcoin way uh which I really love the
[19:19] ton was already also two times on the
[19:21] podcast the other one is a new one it's
[19:23] a a Bitcoin watch so those those are my
[19:25] free um sponsors how I uh usually go
[19:30] ahead like first time first of all they
[19:33] all as far as I know offer a program
[19:37] where everyone can sign up and they
[19:40] provide you with a link and you can use
[19:42] that link to promote uh their things and
[19:47] you get a commission of that that's
[19:49] usually like you have to reach at least
[19:50] that number uh to get a payout because
[19:54] under that it's inefficient to do that
[19:56] that's a feat thing like in Bitcoin Toes
[19:59] that would not be but usually it's not
[20:00] that high like it's € 10 or 15 EUR per
[20:03] month so yeah it's it's it's it's not
[20:06] that big of a problem but yeah still it
[20:08] it is it is something um so that's a
[20:11] source of income for me because uh they
[20:14] pay a a sponsorship uh retainer every
[20:17] month to be on the uh podcast uh then
[20:22] for each sale uh that actually happens I
[20:25] get a small commission for that uh which
[20:27] is a little bit
[20:29] Which is far less than the actual
[20:31] container of it um not far less but yeah
[20:34] it's it's it's smaller than that um and
[20:36] that's how I the market will adjust that
[20:40] I would say the Bitcoin products are
[20:43] really sold through the B B market so uh
[20:47] maybe the next six to 12 months it will
[20:51] change sorry for interrupting yeah yeah
[20:54] it's interesting because uh I I started
[20:56] in like um basically basically March
[21:00] April uh with all the all the sponsors
[21:02] and everything a little bit in February
[21:04] already uh but basically I'm active
[21:06] since a few
[21:08] months so I don't have a lot of data
[21:10] also like I I I don't know what a big
[21:13] podcaster like what Bitcoin did does I
[21:15] assume he has big contracts with his
[21:18] sponsorships that go over years and they
[21:20] are like way more complicated because I
[21:23] don't have contracts like I don't I I
[21:26] don't have any contracts with my
[21:28] sponsors
[21:29] uh I always like okay let's let's try to
[21:31] work together for three months we have
[21:33] this agreement there's like one invoice
[21:35] it's very simple I always want to keep
[21:38] it that way so I can drop a sponsor in
[21:41] like less than three months that that
[21:43] that's my thing because what if the
[21:45] sponsor does anything that I'm really
[21:47] disagree with I don't want to be bind to
[21:49] that sponsor for like two years but
[21:52] that's another topic um I think an
[21:55] interesting point here is also that uh
[21:58] um there is not only sponsors that there
[22:01] is also YouTube uh and YouTube is
[22:05] similar uh they are sharing their
[22:08] revenue with you but it's not that much
[22:11] like they share only a small uh
[22:14] percentage of the revenue with you I
[22:16] don't know like is it 30% or 20% I don't
[22:19] know exactly what it is actually uh I I
[22:22] only see what what I get I don't see
[22:24] what YouTube gets um um but there's also
[22:27] Fountain and the thing is my viewership
[22:30] on YouTube is so much bigger than on
[22:33] Fountain like on Fountain um it's um I
[22:37] don't even know how how big the fhip is
[22:39] but there is already money coming in
[22:41] from day one and that's a big difference
[22:44] I think uh what is bitcoin versus feat
[22:47] because on YouTube you have to hit like
[22:49] a certain amount of subscribers then you
[22:51] have to hit a certain amount of watch
[22:53] time uh so it takes a long time to be
[22:57] monetized but the first check that I got
[23:00] was pretty good like which is kind of
[23:04] positive and negative but it's like you
[23:06] need a long time to get there and then
[23:08] like oh yeah it's a it's it's something
[23:10] I cannot live on that uh but I can pay I
[23:14] can pay a little bit food of for for
[23:16] that so um the the overall is like you
[23:19] have YouTube ad Revenue sharing you have
[23:21] Twitter ad Revenue sharing you have
[23:24] Fountain um which gives you something
[23:26] then you have the uh podcast um
[23:30] sponsorships where you have a monthly
[23:32] retainer plus the um the
[23:36] the uh plus the commissions so the the
[23:39] commissions is kind of what you already
[23:41] talked about with the split payments
[23:43] it's just way more clanky because it's
[23:48] like oh yeah we pay you after uh 30 days
[23:52] or we pay you uh after a month or we pay
[23:56] you once we hit a certain amount or we
[23:58] pay you after the event happened if it's
[24:01] a if it's a event or something like that
[24:03] so there's always like those weird fear
[24:06] things and then you have to pay uh um
[24:08] create an invoice for that amount and
[24:11] you send them then there's all those tax
[24:13] things going on as I'm very small I
[24:16] don't have to pay a lot of taxes
[24:17] actually uh but uh if if this whole
[24:21] thing gets bigger then I probably have
[24:22] to pay a lot of taxes and and find a
[24:24] better tax strategy yeah so that's
[24:27] that's all things that uh I just want to
[24:29] collect all the information and and you
[24:31] can go ahead now yeah and all of those
[24:34] things that you're describing those
[24:37] problems are not because of your
[24:40] sponsors all of those problems is
[24:43] because of the Fiat infrastructure the
[24:45] barrier of $10 is not because they don't
[24:48] want to pay you the commission of 20
[24:50] cents the problem is that if they pay
[24:53] you 20 cents they have to pay $2 to
[24:56] process all those things for from their
[24:58] side obviously nobody will do that but
[25:01] that is an infrastructure problem that
[25:04] Bitcoin solves whether that's on
[25:07] obviously not on the first layer but
[25:09] with the lightning Network currently and
[25:11] we when even lightning Network becomes
[25:15] um uh a lot of traffic there you can
[25:18] abstract it on ecash to be even cheaper
[25:21] and all of those even even if it is one
[25:24] cent commission you can receive it in
[25:28] instantly and that also uh completely
[25:32] eliminates this third party trust um
[25:36] because even third party trust and uh
[25:39] risk happens even if they keep the money
[25:42] for a little bit so in that period
[25:46] you're uncertain what will happen to
[25:48] them and if you receive it but because
[25:50] the instant settlement uh and it's
[25:53] split there there's no accounting on
[25:56] their side that means it's lower in
[25:58] their cost uh there is no budget as they
[26:01] say for you to take a code just like the
[26:04] codes right now but even on the user
[26:07] side let's talk about on the user side
[26:09] me uh because I'm not a podcaster but uh
[26:13] I watch um podcast a lot I really don't
[26:17] like when uh you're interrupted in the
[26:20] middle or anything whether it's on TV or
[26:23] anywhere with a message that I did not
[26:25] consent to but if if you invite let's
[26:30] say a uh a hardware wallet manufacturer
[26:33] and you interview them and it's part of
[26:36] the conversation I would be happy if I'm
[26:39] convinced to buy it and that's how you
[26:42] sell now you're not interrupted and the
[26:44] user experience is greater and it will
[26:47] be much faster because you're just
[26:49] scanning one uh QR code and I directly
[26:52] buy and all the infrastructure happens
[26:55] in the background and the user
[26:57] experience is great R uh you are happy
[27:01] because you receive instantly they are
[27:03] happy because you receive money
[27:04] instantly and you can actually deploy
[27:08] those funds right after that because
[27:11] let's say you have something uh
[27:13] automatic that uh you receive 10 bucks
[27:16] of one Hardware wallet and you deploy
[27:20] those 10 bucks to promote your podcast
[27:23] if you'd like to in any platform and
[27:25] that's automatic uh growth Revenue
[27:29] because you're small and now you can
[27:31] catch up to the big guys that have
[27:34] contracts with sponsors or anything and
[27:36] you the whole infrastructure will create
[27:40] a real open market and an open market
[27:44] means competition for anybody nobody is
[27:50] excluded because if you exclude somebody
[27:53] that means that it will centralize more
[27:56] and more because you it not open but
[27:59] yeah let's leave it here and I'll add uh
[28:02] more even after that if you watch or
[28:04] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[28:07] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[28:09] and now the most important step is to
[28:12] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[28:15] hardware wallet my personal
[28:17] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[28:18] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[28:21] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[28:23] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[28:26] exchange and you can get get a 5%
[28:29] discount with the code Robin at the
[28:31] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[28:35] to get your bitbox and if you really
[28:38] want to bulletproof your self custody
[28:40] setup your security setup and maybe even
[28:43] your citizenship set up you have to talk
[28:46] to the Bitcoin way if you go to the
[28:49] Bitcoin way.com
[28:51] Partners Robin you get a 30 minute free
[28:55] call where you can dive deep with them
[28:58] if your self custody setup is secure if
[29:01] your citizenship is secure or maybe
[29:04] might be improvable or your digital
[29:06] footprint in general is secure they are
[29:10] the experts in cyber security in Bitcoin
[29:13] self custody and how to be a secure
[29:16] sovereign individual in general and last
[29:19] but not least I have something
[29:21] completely new for you guys I partnered
[29:24] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[29:27] pure beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I
[29:30] ever saw created by anyone look at that
[29:33] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[29:36] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[29:39] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[29:42] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[29:45] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[29:48] make sure to check out the link in the
[29:50] description for this amazing coin
[29:52] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[29:55] amazing I love them so much it was
[29:57] really hard for me to pick the one that
[29:59] I want to have because there are a lot
[30:01] of great options I went with the new
[30:03] transparency Edition they all limited so
[30:07] grab yours those will not be available
[30:10] for a long time but there will come new
[30:12] models and new amazing designs along the
[30:14] way it's interesting I feel like social
[30:18] media um in in general is quite open to
[30:23] newcomers I mean my my show is I think
[30:25] one attest to that because uh I'm just
[30:28] eight months old in the podcast game
[30:30] like my YouTube channel actually like
[30:33] eight months ago had like 200
[30:35] subscribers and now it's cross to 8,000
[30:38] today so when this will be out like will
[30:41] be a little bit more than that um so I
[30:44] feel like if if you actually do a lot of
[30:46] work you can cross uh way better in
[30:49] already because social media is a kind
[30:51] of a decentralization of TV and those
[30:54] channels there was really bad because
[30:57] you you basically had to sleep your way
[30:59] up to get a show and then do do like
[31:02] yeah we all know why why TV is is wrong
[31:05] but still yes there is a thing for
[31:08] example on YouTube we all know it the
[31:10] biggest channels are in small Elite
[31:13] group and this group is actually
[31:15] existing like there's a small group on
[31:17] on YouTube that they have like monthly
[31:19] meetings they they have like special
[31:21] access to to YouTube um once you hit for
[31:25] example 100,000 subscribers you get um
[31:28] key account from YouTube that you can do
[31:31] uh you you can uh exchange things uh
[31:34] with uh and for people like Mr Beast and
[31:37] the really big ones on YouTube um they
[31:40] can really closely work together uh with
[31:43] YouTube for example the feature where
[31:45] there's different audio tracks like
[31:47] there's a Spanish audio track and stuff
[31:49] like that on YouTube first only Mr the
[31:51] Beast had it now a few more have it I
[31:55] still don't have it because I would love
[31:56] to uh also have like Spanish audio
[31:59] tracks on my podcast and stuff like that
[32:01] so there's that I don't know it's
[32:04] interesting for me to think about that
[32:06] if that's an fear thing because maybe
[32:08] it's also just like a company thing
[32:11] because like YouTube would also probably
[32:13] uh exist on a sound money standard maybe
[32:16] it will be something like Nostra do you
[32:18] think like that example with the audio
[32:20] track that the feature is first only for
[32:22] the biggest one and then slowly rolling
[32:24] out the small ones is that a feat thing
[32:26] uh I would say yes because of the
[32:29] current again thinking infrastructure
[32:31] and this is uh I'm emphasizing I really
[32:35] love that you brought that particular
[32:37] Point uh because obviously you thought
[32:40] about this particular thing but now
[32:44] think in the Bitcoin infrastructure
[32:47] that's currently out that same problem
[32:51] because uh all the problems that
[32:54] Humanity has what infrastructure people
[32:57] use it it really doesn't matter people
[32:59] want to solve their problems but if you
[33:02] think in one infrastructure is uh you
[33:05] will have particular limitations and
[33:08] opportunities and in the other because
[33:10] if you're this one top
[33:12] guy that's benefit for you because all
[33:15] the others are excluded because that
[33:18] even points even more people to you and
[33:21] excluding the competition but all the
[33:24] people that are fighting to be the best
[33:26] that's against them
[33:28] but if it is an open network that exact
[33:31] same problem now can you do this uh can
[33:36] you think of a way for that same problem
[33:40] for somebody to solve it not only to
[33:42] solve it but for them to pay you and no
[33:46] is a perfectly fine answer no
[33:51] no but go ahead uh okay now think I'm
[33:55] not saying this is the solution but it's
[33:58] an optional solution now what if you
[34:02] reach out a very tiny small let's say
[34:05] Spanish podcaster and you ask him please
[34:09] translate the audio to my podcast do it
[34:14] uh as a bitcoiner and now you create a
[34:18] secondary podcast that you host with
[34:21] them and you do a split
[34:23] payment of his secondary content because
[34:27] because you're part of it maybe you give
[34:29] him the majority or whatever you decide
[34:32] but basically because he is creating
[34:34] additional content on your original
[34:37] content people when they zap him uh send
[34:41] him uh SS you receive a split payment of
[34:45] that payment and it's basically him
[34:47] paying you and not working for you that
[34:51] infrastructure is impossible in a lot of
[34:56] fat things people need to work for you
[34:59] and Obey to your rules because he is not
[35:03] tied to you it's just an option if he
[35:05] says oh it's not worth it he drops out
[35:09] and uh it's uh a mutual understanding
[35:12] but you don't need a contract to him
[35:14] because you don't need kyc you don't
[35:16] need any Fiat infrastructure because
[35:19] you're completely on the Bitcoin
[35:21] infrastructure there but I'm saying if
[35:24] we really think about building things
[35:27] through infrastructure and then build
[35:30] those experiences through this because
[35:33] the optionality in the be the Bitcoin uh
[35:37] system is completely new and we are
[35:41] still thinking through F structure to
[35:44] solve it to solve the problems with
[35:47] Bitcoin and that's a wrong approach we
[35:51] need to think in the completely new
[35:54] system completely disregarding the Fiat
[35:57] think
[35:58] and that's I'm saying extremely hard and
[36:01] that just one example of what I've
[36:04] thought about because the opportunity is
[36:06] there and what you said also on Fountain
[36:09] you can start receiving money on the
[36:11] first day but now they integrate with
[36:15] Noster and even the comments you can
[36:18] start receiving from the first day and
[36:20] that's a network effect on your content
[36:22] the audio content and then it's a
[36:24] network effect on the um uh comment on
[36:28] your content that you can receive money
[36:30] for and then they'll add something else
[36:32] and something else and that's be Bitcoin
[36:35] infrastructure that's completely new and
[36:39] that's why I'm saying build on bitcoin
[36:42] because those experiences will be
[36:45] impossible on the fat infrastructure and
[36:48] that's how we transition into this new
[36:50] life because that opportunity and thing
[36:54] is decentralizing on any point because
[36:57] we don't want only what Bitcoin did to
[37:00] have all the sponsors we want uh it's
[37:04] not good for the Bitcoin ecosystem it's
[37:07] not good for the podcasters it's not
[37:09] good for even the the actual sponsors in
[37:12] the other
[37:14] infrastructure uh the podcasters will
[37:17] receive more money whether they are
[37:19] small or big the uh sponsors will
[37:22] receive more money because more people
[37:25] are promoting them and they will receive
[37:27] in instantly and all of those will flow
[37:29] naturally without any barriers and
[37:32] that's really the message that I wanted
[37:34] to emphasize because we couldn't talk on
[37:37] the first episode you completely don't
[37:41] try to solve problems in the Fiat
[37:44] infrastructure think completely in the
[37:47] new system and that is really what Jeff
[37:50] bu message is that is where the
[37:52] abundance is it's not solving problems
[37:55] the Bitcoin system is not here to solve
[37:57] the problems that we have the Bitcoin
[37:59] systems is competing with the Fiat
[38:02] system I have a small uh Adventure that
[38:05] I want to go with you outside of the
[38:08] topic a little bit outside of the topic
[38:09] sure um because I am right now not a lot
[38:14] on Nostra um I'm really focused on like
[38:18] just having my
[38:19] podcast and uh I also do that on on X on
[38:22] x I do don't do a lot so uh I I I I have
[38:27] some tools where I just put my things in
[38:29] and then they get sent out through all
[38:31] the all the social media accounts um so
[38:35] because of that I'm only the the closest
[38:38] thing that I'm on is Fountain and I
[38:41] connected there and everything and I
[38:43] even had a had Nick Mal on uh from
[38:46] Fountain from the team um how does how
[38:49] did Fountain Now integrate with Nostra
[38:52] uh and do you have any
[38:55] additional uh tips for me as a podcaster
[38:58] to be on Nosa should is there any other
[39:01] platform outside of fountain that I
[39:03] should upload my podcast where people on
[39:06] Nostra like to consume a
[39:08] podcast uh I would say that um currently
[39:13] norer if you're a content creator you
[39:16] should uh invest 5% time just like R&D
[39:21] because that is your product and if you
[39:24] don't invest in R&D you'll miss a lot of
[39:26] opportunity not is a big opportunity
[39:29] especially for Content creators how you
[39:32] apply uh currently it's fountain for the
[39:35] podcaster the most uh dominant one but
[39:38] something might change in the future uh
[39:41] the the very simple thing that you can
[39:45] do is one of the social clients like
[39:48] Primal damos anywhere because if you
[39:52] post something there everybody sees it
[39:55] uh something that I don't have uh I
[39:57] wrote a few articles and I received
[40:00] let's say uh 15 20 bucks uh for them and
[40:04] I don't write but I write very rarely
[40:07] but you post every single day just take
[40:11] that link of YouTube and post it in um
[40:16] in Noster see what happens uh as I say I
[40:20] cannot give recommendation because
[40:22] that's not my jam but invest some
[40:25] portion of the time just like in the
[40:27] beginning beginning with Bitcoin start
[40:28] with 1% 2% but I would say
[40:31] 5% uh it's good for any business to
[40:34] invest in R&D uh and R&D uh could be
[40:39] Noster but I'm including even other
[40:41] stuff that are Fiat type of things so
[40:44] some portion of the time just invest and
[40:47] you will find what's best suited for you
[40:51] but that's one of the things that I
[40:52] could recommend is there a way to
[40:55] integrate YouTube videos in in AUST or
[40:57] something like that that would be really
[40:59] interesting uh yeah just place the link
[41:02] uh as a post and you can watch the
[41:04] Youtube video directly in noer oh nice I
[41:08] did knew that actually wow yeah I'm
[41:13] not yeah and I I'm just saying I would
[41:17] love uh to see um to see your feedback
[41:21] on that because uh very few podcasts
[41:24] actually do this uh but there are
[41:27] podcast that are not every day and I see
[41:30] that the content creators in Noster they
[41:33] receive a lot of ss and not only that
[41:37] but when you receive there I would also
[41:39] recommend start uh start also sharing SS
[41:44] there because you receive directly start
[41:46] sharing SS and uh because that type of
[41:49] thing is tracked and people will see
[41:51] what you're promoting also so you will
[41:54] create a relationship with your all your
[41:57] own audience and those people that are
[42:00] there are innovators and maybe because
[42:04] you're there some client
[42:06] will will try to out compete Fountain
[42:09] and attract you because you're posting
[42:11] every day I have no idea but I'm saying
[42:15] start thinking in those completely new
[42:18] experiences through that type of
[42:20] infrastructure and see what happens uh I
[42:23] cannot predict it because nobody has
[42:25] done it before like we can predict what
[42:28] happened with YouTube because YouTube
[42:30] now exists for how many years and we all
[42:33] know that you kind of have to be an
[42:35] Insider or H the codes uh the algorithm
[42:39] so you can have an advantage but in noer
[42:43] it's still R&D and uh I'm now in noer
[42:48] for uh a year and eight months and in
[42:53] that year and eight months from
[42:55] something that was almost impossible to
[42:59] um to sign in now it's so easy comparing
[43:04] it
[43:05] in I cannot imagine what would happen in
[43:08] a year and a half but in that year and a
[43:10] half the podcasts that are already there
[43:12] will have a first mover Advantage I also
[43:15] think so uh first mover Advantage is
[43:17] amazing and a l Fountain already like
[43:19] there is uh people actually commenting
[43:22] boosting streaming uh that's that's an
[43:25] amazing thing uh that it it's already
[43:28] happening there and also like I have
[43:32] um I have one link where I collect SATs
[43:37] I collected SATs like five years ago or
[43:39] something like that and now it's it's
[43:42] still active and someone found that and
[43:44] like gifted me like 50,000 SATs through
[43:47] that and I was like oh what so like it's
[43:50] always interesting it's a really cool
[43:52] feeling also uh but yeah I have to be
[43:55] more active in in the era uh maybe even
[43:59] like Fountain a little bit more active
[44:01] and and doing more things there but it's
[44:03] it's slowly agre actually uh yeah just
[44:06] do a little bit uh I'm not saying that
[44:08] you have to really focus on it but uh
[44:12] start playing around with the tools and
[44:15] something will spark an interest and
[44:17] then focus on it because it really
[44:19] inspired you but right now just start
[44:21] something and another thing let's say
[44:24] you post something and because you use
[44:27] AI uh with the podcast what stops you
[44:30] actually to do a resume under the video
[44:33] and see what are the points as a
[44:36] comments and on all of those points you
[44:38] post it in a Noster client and people
[44:40] can comment on the resume of the thing
[44:43] and data tracks just like in YouTube If
[44:46] you comment in the YouTube uh below this
[44:49] is a silo in Noster everybody can see it
[44:52] and even if a client is created that
[44:55] cannot see the actual YouTube video they
[44:58] can see the resume and they will search
[45:01] for the YouTube video and the
[45:03] discoverability now it's uh again it's
[45:07] open network on top of an open network
[45:10] on top of an open network and a lot of
[45:12] things are building and uh even today I
[45:15] watched some of the uh stream from
[45:18] nostri currently it's happening on noer
[45:21] event in uh lattia and just start there
[45:26] maybe uh see what's happening and you
[45:29] will pick the things where you are going
[45:31] to do but uh I would recommend the
[45:35] easiest thing is just post the YouTube
[45:39] video there even if you don't do
[45:40] anything else those are SS that people
[45:43] will zap you that you're missing
[45:45] currently interesting do you think that
[45:48] the whole internet uh at some point will
[45:51] be will be like that like at maybe not
[45:54] in five years but maybe 50 years maybe
[45:55] 100 years maybe 500 years do you think
[45:58] that the whole internet and all the
[46:00] communications through like things that
[46:02] we now use with telegram WhatsApp uh and
[46:05] all those things will they at some point
[46:08] be uh on a open protocol which is
[46:12] interconnected to each other like Nostra
[46:15] with lightning saps and stuff like that
[46:18] uh I think this is a need that we
[46:21] currently understand uh we have to have
[46:24] whether that's Noster how it is
[46:27] currently because not noer has some
[46:29] limitations when we get the really big
[46:31] scales uh when we get to 500 million
[46:35] users a billion users there are
[46:37] limitations in the protocol itself uh
[46:40] that are beyond my comprehension but I
[46:43] talk to Dev uh but definitely this is a
[46:46] need and because all of those open
[46:48] network will out compete the closed
[46:51] networks is just right they're just now
[46:54] starting just like uh Bitcoin is a
[46:58] teenager Noster is a toddler so we are
[47:02] just very very early in that competition
[47:06] but again going back to we have infinite
[47:10] time there is not a clock of 90 minutes
[47:13] for a football game or anything we have
[47:15] infinite time so the better value uh
[47:20] experience and everything else will
[47:22] outco compete the other that thing just
[47:26] needs to be realized and because it's
[47:28] open
[47:29] network I would say even currently
[47:32] Noster has more developers this is from
[47:35] the stream uh today from Noster Noster
[47:38] has more developers today than any other
[47:42] platform so just because we have the bad
[47:45] experience now what happens is uh when
[47:49] uh the experience becomes better and we
[47:52] still have more developers than now the
[47:56] experience will will get better and
[47:57] better and better infinitely and it's
[48:01] for all of our benefit not for a
[48:03] centralized Point benefit that is
[48:06] extracting from us nobody is forced on
[48:09] Noster so if you want to be there you
[48:12] will be there and you will have benefit
[48:14] if you're not as I said uh so if it
[48:18] really works the first movers will have
[48:22] a bigger benefit than the others but the
[48:25] best thing currently Noster is just
[48:28] build your social graph there because
[48:30] that's one of the most valuable things
[48:33] and the experiences are something that
[48:35] needs to be experimented on what do you
[48:38] mean with social
[48:39] graph uh the social graph is uh uh in
[48:43] YouTube is your subscribers though that
[48:46] is all the people the your social
[48:48] network in the YouTube in Facebook are
[48:51] all your friends in Twitter is all your
[48:54] followers and all of those are social
[48:57] social graphs that's people that are
[49:00] following you and that you are connected
[49:02] to and all of those Network are not
[49:05] connected to each other in Noster there
[49:08] is one social grave and the people that
[49:12] is comenting on the video will be the
[49:14] same uh people that you're connected on
[49:17] the uh direct messages like signal or
[49:21] the Facebook imagine that you can
[49:25] comment on a YouTube and you can see it
[49:27] in Facebook and the Facebook you can see
[49:29] it in Twitter and in Twitter you can see
[49:32] it in the Articles of Bitcoin magazine
[49:34] or anything else all of those are
[49:36] connected into the same thing but how
[49:39] you view all of those posts are just
[49:42] different designs and different
[49:44] experiences because that's what noer
[49:46] gives you that you're connected to
[49:48] everybody in the same place and you
[49:50] don't have to repost on LinkedIn on
[49:53] YouTube on Twitter on Facebook on
[49:56] everything you post once and everybody
[49:59] that you're connected to sees it would
[50:01] be amazing I I would love that so much
[50:03] because it's a hustle as a content
[50:05] creator to like oh yeah I build out my
[50:07] acts now I have to build out my YouTube
[50:09] now I have to build out my Instagram now
[50:10] I have to build that and I'm like yeah
[50:13] does it ever end I mean to a certain
[50:16] extent you can uh I just saw it like
[50:18] right before we started the the podcast
[50:21] Cristiano Ronaldo is now also on YouTube
[50:25] and he has an Instagram account and he
[50:28] broke all the records like he uh broke
[50:31] the record for getting to a million
[50:32] subscribers he got into a million
[50:35] subscribers in like I don't know 10
[50:36] minutes uh do two million subscribers in
[50:39] like 30 minutes so like really
[50:42] influential people they they have the
[50:44] their social graph and they just have to
[50:46] open account and then they have the
[50:48] followers also there uh but that's not
[50:51] the case for everyone um so that's
[50:53] that's really an interesting uh use case
[50:56] is when we think about um social graph
[51:00] which also interesting because for
[51:02] example if someone uh writes me on X a
[51:06] DM hey do you can I be on your podcast
[51:10] uh then the first thing I see is his
[51:12] profile and there's one thing that I'm
[51:14] in particular very interested in how
[51:17] many people that I follow follow him
[51:20] because this
[51:21] is that's the quickest way to know um uh
[51:25] if he's really if he's really
[51:27] interesting I have a lot of guests on
[51:30] that have not been followed by anyone
[51:32] that I follow because like when I see
[51:36] okay like 300 people that I follow also
[51:39] follow him it's pretty safe to say I can
[51:41] have him on the podcast because a lot of
[51:43] people already follow him so he's
[51:45] probably very interesting also to my
[51:47] audience if he has no one uh that uh I
[51:51] follow that they follow that him follow
[51:54] then I have to dig deeper I have to
[51:56] induct with him have to ride with him
[51:58] and find out if he's a good fit for the
[52:00] podcast or not um but that is a real
[52:03] thing and now imagine having this social
[52:06] graph everywhere where you can see like
[52:09] uh oh uh let's check out this restaurant
[52:12] oh my aunt was there and my aunt really
[52:14] liked it oh my friend was there and he
[52:17] really liked it when you have this
[52:18] social graph everywhere that that's uh
[52:22] that's the thing I love the most about
[52:24] the social graph and Nostra idea here
[52:27] where I'm like what if you can take your
[52:29] whole um uh social graph your your your
[52:34] follower your friends your family
[52:36] whatever into the digital realm and like
[52:39] hey I want to find out what's really
[52:43] cool in Portugal because I'm now uh
[52:46] making holiday in Portugal hey there's
[52:48] this I don't know um ice cream shop uh
[52:52] three of my friends were there and they
[52:53] all really loved it so let's check the
[52:55] ice cream shop out so that's one thing
[52:57] that I for example love a lot when we
[53:00] have that because it it exists already
[53:03] with Google and with all this isolated
[53:07] things but what if this all is connected
[53:10] and connected centralized connected but
[53:14] nobody has the control over it that's
[53:16] that's the the real thing because like
[53:17] it it looks like yeah if what if Google
[53:20] controls everything then it would also
[53:22] be there but that would not be a
[53:24] beautiful world because then Google has
[53:26] a lot of power that we don't want yeah
[53:29] absolutely and that's why I say uh for
[53:32] me any content creator should be on
[53:35] Noster just to play around with the
[53:38] thing because you know the problems in
[53:41] the Fiat infrastructure much much much
[53:44] better than me I'm not a content creator
[53:47] but uh right now it's used as content
[53:50] creation and there are uh clients that
[53:54] are or interfaces of Noster that uh can
[53:58] be created for a very particular type of
[54:01] use case that let's say uh you make a
[54:05] deal when your podcast becomes big and
[54:08] you want to create a newsletter of your
[54:11] podcast and you want to create a client
[54:15] that seeks out every time that somebody
[54:18] mentions you or your podcast and to
[54:20] create and filter all of the other
[54:23] things out and all of that is option now
[54:26] that you can create anything you want
[54:30] you even if somebody blocks you they
[54:32] don't really block your data they block
[54:35] you if you are visible let's say on
[54:38] Primal or deos or anywhere else they can
[54:41] block you through one interface let's
[54:43] say right now if YouTube blocks you you
[54:46] cannot go anywhere else almost but if
[54:50] anything blocks you in Noster They Don't
[54:53] Really blocked you they just uh block
[54:57] themselves of benefiting from your
[54:59] content because your content is out
[55:02] there and anybody can see it but they
[55:05] are blocking themselves from benefiting
[55:08] from you and that's uh uh aligned
[55:12] incentives and again it's a lot of
[55:16] potential still uh there a lot of clink
[55:20] and stuff like that but as I said in a
[55:23] year and a half the experience that I
[55:25] have uh completely changed and they're
[55:28] putting AI stuff they're putting so many
[55:31] specialized things uh even if you want
[55:34] to chat and uh talk uh audio call or
[55:38] voice over IP they are creating those
[55:42] particular clients in Noster so the idea
[55:45] is that potentially Noster will be the
[55:48] new internet the internet that has
[55:50] native money that is again this open uh
[55:53] Bitcoin infrastructure and
[55:57] it's such a beautiful world on the other
[55:59] side but it is so incredibly hard to not
[56:03] think in Fiat terms uh and solve the
[56:07] problems that we currently have just
[56:09] completely shift and think in the new
[56:13] system that's what again hash Jeff Bo
[56:17] that is where abundance is uh but uh
[56:20] unless you actually start doing it and
[56:23] you're still uh Knee Deep into your
[56:26] current problems uh that's not the way
[56:30] that you're going to benefit a lot I'm
[56:33] not saying the problems uh are
[56:35] irrelevant but I'm saying if you want to
[56:37] out compete everybody else you need to
[56:39] switch your thinking think
[56:42] differently interesting I just pull it
[56:45] up uh because I have a I have a Nostra
[56:48] uh maybe how can I is it it possible
[56:52] yeah you see it uh yeah yeah it's it's
[56:56] still my my old like I started it like a
[56:58] year ago or something like that and I
[57:00] saw my last post really cool and it's
[57:03] like over 100
[57:05] SATs
[57:06] nice yeah I have to be more active on
[57:09] there but I will I will probably like
[57:12] start today with exchanging the profile
[57:14] picture and the pan a picture with a new
[57:16] one is damos the best uh one what do you
[57:19] use as Primal d uh it's so much
[57:24] switching uh for example over this year
[57:26] and a half I started with um uh snort
[57:32] was okay but then it was out competed by
[57:36] Primal right now I really love what Yaki
[57:40] hon is uh doing uh it's still a lot of
[57:45] things has benefit in one thing and the
[57:47] other but I am subscribed not subscribed
[57:51] but I uh see Noster through six
[57:55] different uh client uh and everybody has
[57:58] a different interface and different
[58:01] options and different things and uh I'm
[58:04] just trying again to keep up with what's
[58:07] happening there and I post here and
[58:09] there and I comment on some
[58:11] stuff and don't focus a lot of the time
[58:15] again but some partial uh time to be
[58:19] there it's really beneficial and uh like
[58:24] you said imagine that you are in that
[58:28] social graph before Ronaldo and when
[58:31] Ronaldo comes in you're one of the first
[58:33] that comments on his and you can benefit
[58:35] from that Network effect coming into you
[58:38] and what happens if Ronaldo is already
[58:40] there and you follow him uh it's not
[58:44] going to have that beneficial of social
[58:46] gr and the most beautiful thing is that
[58:50] when you build your social graph you
[58:52] cannot go down unless you're crappy
[58:55] content creator
[58:57] but in the Fiat infrastructure you can
[58:59] go down you can be blocked you can be
[59:02] Shadow baned you can be anything in
[59:05] Noster you can just build on top of
[59:08] everything that you already have yeah
[59:10] really interesting um let's make now one
[59:13] one more for experiment you said before
[59:16] that Bitcoin is in the teenage years and
[59:19] nostr is at hler yeah how does the world
[59:22] look like when this is not the case
[59:25] anymore when Bitcoin is already an adult
[59:28] Nostra is an adult uh maybe let's say 30
[59:32] years from now uh nostro will be over 30
[59:35] years Bitcoin will be over 40 years um
[59:38] what kind of world is that H how how do
[59:41] you see the the impacts of
[59:44] that uh I would say something that will
[59:49] be absolutely true a lot of things will
[59:51] be unknown but those two things are open
[59:56] networks as we uh said and open networks
[60:00] what it means that it is open market
[60:03] which again means that it is it is a
[60:07] global
[60:08] competition so for the people that don't
[60:12] want to compete that play dirty will be
[60:16] bad because uh they are not used to this
[60:20] but for real true competitors it will be
[60:23] awesome because uh me as a ex Sportsman
[60:29] I love to compete against people that
[60:31] are better than me because I want to
[60:33] beat them because I want to be better
[60:35] than me and that's the premise of any
[60:37] sport or any competition and that's the
[60:40] real true market that Bitcoin is playing
[60:43] the this infinite game and it is a
[60:46] competition out of all the currencies
[60:48] it's not that Bitcoin does not have
[60:50] limitations yes it has limitations but
[60:53] we are competing and the better person
[60:56] will win the better system will win and
[61:00] that is the thing that will be on this
[61:02] other side after 30 40 years that
[61:06] because it is competing we will see the
[61:09] winner the winner from my point of view
[61:12] it's already set but the other system
[61:16] has thousands or if not thousands
[61:19] hundreds of years
[61:22] Advance against this new system but
[61:26] because of all the problems and because
[61:28] they
[61:30] disincentivize competition that is why
[61:33] they will win the Fiat infrastructure
[61:35] will lose because it is not a free
[61:38] market because it is not a competition
[61:41] there are barriers their blocks their
[61:44] bands their uh forces that are against
[61:47] this free market and the other free
[61:49] market because it's truly free the best
[61:52] person will win the best user experience
[61:55] will win
[61:56] uh because of those experiences we all
[61:59] want to have those experiences just like
[62:03] we talked about the split payment yeah
[62:04] the split payment it's not when you talk
[62:07] about it oh you receive a commission if
[62:10] if you think through the current uh
[62:12] thinking big deal but if you really
[62:14] think about the implications of what
[62:17] allows freedom and all of those
[62:20] competing forces how they're going to
[62:21] out compete the people people that do
[62:24] not Implement that split pain payment
[62:26] now that experience will out compete the
[62:29] other and the world becomes better uh
[62:33] and that's infinitely for the future
[62:36] what again hash J boo happens because
[62:40] the best experience the best value
[62:43] providing to humanity will win that is
[62:46] why we will uh have money that uh uh
[62:50] everything bought through Bitcoin will
[62:53] be will become cheaper and cheap cheaper
[62:56] obviously people want that and the other
[62:59] becomes more expensive and more
[63:02] expensive if you say it like that uh
[63:05] obviously what would win with infinite
[63:08] time but in the current state uh it's
[63:12] just a lot of misinformation a lot of
[63:14] people just need to learn a lot of
[63:16] people need to detoxicate and it but
[63:20] because uh nobody can stop you from
[63:23] joining noar nobody can stop you from
[63:26] building on bitcoin you will provide
[63:29] that extra experience that will give you
[63:31] value because you're giving value to the
[63:33] world and that is where we will be in 30
[63:36] 40 years that people voluntarily will
[63:40] come uh competitors in anything that
[63:43] they do and because they are competitors
[63:45] that means that we will enjoy the best
[63:48] of humanity and currently we are not I I
[63:51] love that with the
[63:53] competition uh the the proof of work
[63:56] aspect also really interesting when you
[64:00] when you think at the current state of
[64:01] Bitcoin right now when we have a lot of
[64:04] ETFs a lot of people hold their Bitcoin
[64:08] on exchanges on ETFs on on centralized
[64:12] uh things only a small amount of people
[64:15] actually
[64:16] have solid multi signature self custody
[64:22] solution or whatever they they should
[64:24] have or like a self custody the solution
[64:26] in in general um what do you do do you
[64:30] think there is a chance that even
[64:33] Bitcoin gets captured by the the
[64:36] centralized uh authorities not in a
[64:39] sense where Bitcoin gets manipulated but
[64:42] in a sense where people are getting used
[64:44] to this convenient way of using Bitcoin
[64:47] because yeah of course it's more
[64:48] convenient to use Bitcoin uh in in in
[64:52] exchange because yeah it's just numbers
[64:54] on a screen like it's the common way
[64:56] that you you log in with your password
[64:59] uh it's it's it's you're use to that uh
[65:01] if you have to educate yourself what a
[65:03] hardware wallet how signing going to do
[65:06] what what do I have to do or I have to
[65:08] run a node also for privacy and all
[65:10] those things like um do do you think
[65:13] that Bitcoin might be uh
[65:17] revolutionizing uh the store of value
[65:20] aspect but but not more of that because
[65:22] it gets captured by those centralized uh
[65:25] things do you think that's is a
[65:28] possibility I would say because uh with
[65:31] Breeze and we're building on the second
[65:34] layer and we're really focusing on the
[65:36] medium of exchange uh part of Bitcoin
[65:40] that uh real
[65:43] Mone of it I would say uh it will be
[65:48] extremely hard uh I would say the best
[65:52] of humanity currently has the tools and
[65:56] the power to do something about like we
[66:00] talked the 1% has enormous power and the
[66:04] 99% are obeying because they cannot
[66:07] fight against it but now the majority
[66:10] and even one person think about this one
[66:14] person most likely Satoshi Nakamoto gave
[66:18] this to the world and it is out
[66:20] competing everything else and it's not
[66:25] need needed that Bitcoin needs to be
[66:28] realized by the majority it's needed for
[66:32] that one Builder to give this to the
[66:36] world and if we have the Fiat mentality
[66:41] currently that wants to capture Bitcoin
[66:43] and to become from p p dollar to the
[66:46] Bitcoin dollar thing yes they can do
[66:49] that but in Bitcoin even if they rob the
[66:52] majority of people and let's say they
[66:54] rob uh
[66:56] and they have four million five million
[66:58] 10 million of Bitcoin I I I don't care
[67:00] even those numbers are I think
[67:03] impossible uh because on that other side
[67:07] that they can rob the humanity once in
[67:10] the Bitcoin system that pain that
[67:14] suffering from the people will be such a
[67:17] lesson just like FTX was the best day
[67:20] when people started buying Hardware
[67:22] wallets yes they will capture it but
[67:25] from that pain because there is no
[67:27] bailout now the majority of people after
[67:31] they are robbed they will say I don't
[67:33] want your dollars pay me in Bitcoin or
[67:36] I'm not going to opt back in even if
[67:39] they're captured currently and that is
[67:42] the best feature that in the Bitcoin
[67:44] system the people that have to lose
[67:48] actually lose and in the Fiat system the
[67:51] people that should not win are winning
[67:54] because they're not allowed to go
[67:56] bankrupt I love that uh that line really
[67:59] really cool um as you also said you your
[68:03] your from PRI um I I want to go only a
[68:06] little bit and quick in there um do you
[68:09] think that uh we covered it a little bit
[68:12] on the topic we also covered it a little
[68:13] bit uh in the previous episode uh with
[68:17] you do you think that everything will be
[68:20] also built on lightning is is lightning
[68:23] kind of the the layer that already has
[68:25] has won the the share or is there like
[68:28] room for other layer too so how do you
[68:30] see the the future scaling for all that
[68:32] building on top of
[68:34] Bitcoin uh as we talked I still hold
[68:37] this uh value that lightning is again a
[68:42] competition out of all the other layer
[68:44] tools and lightning because it really
[68:47] preserve the
[68:49] trustless uh a lot on the second layer
[68:54] uh like the Bitcoin blockchain because
[68:58] that's the fundamental thing that uh on
[69:01] the first layer we have
[69:04] incorruptibility on the second layer we
[69:06] need to preserve it maximum uh this uh
[69:09] feature and lightning is that solution
[69:12] uh right now and like we talked on
[69:15] Noster the network effect on Lightning
[69:18] uh right now it's not going to be
[69:21] surpassed maybe there's a very thin Edge
[69:25] case of you need to solve something for
[69:28] another for that particular ede case and
[69:31] you create another layer two but it's
[69:35] not going to be the main component of
[69:37] layer twos because um even uh our CEO
[69:41] Roy wrote this article that lightning
[69:45] even now is the common language that we
[69:48] all speak in Bitcoin payment terms that
[69:51] even eash let's say uh the Privacy will
[69:55] be with ecash but ecash will be on not
[69:58] on top of but will be integrated with
[70:01] the lightning Network so uh if I'm in
[70:03] one Federation or I'm in one ecash mint
[70:07] and you're in another to send you that
[70:09] ecash it will go through the lightning
[70:12] network if uh we're using liquid uh we
[70:16] even now created uh liquid SDK on our
[70:19] end on infrastructure and that is also
[70:22] using lighting so all of those other
[70:25] open networks will be connected through
[70:29] this common language of the lightning
[70:31] Network and the metaphor that he used in
[70:34] the article is really uh I speak uh
[70:37] Bulgarian language you speak German but
[70:40] we're communicating in English and that
[70:44] is the lightning Network that yeah we
[70:46] might have different networks and
[70:49] different properties in uh those cases
[70:52] but the common thing that everybody will
[70:55] use and it's functional operational and
[70:58] everything now is the lightning Network
[71:01] even if we have other things it will be
[71:03] small niches to solve a particular use
[71:07] case of a very particular group
[71:09] absolutely uh that's I think it's a
[71:12] great Insight in the lightning Network I
[71:14] also feel like when when we talk about
[71:16] scaling Solutions you you can't really
[71:19] go without the lightning Network at this
[71:21] point it would be hard for me to uh see
[71:23] the lightning network not being minent
[71:25] Layer Two but it's it's it's interesting
[71:27] for me for me it's always like okay
[71:29] Bitcoin is is is is the base layer Layer
[71:32] Two I still have to educate myself more
[71:35] on top of that even though I have done a
[71:37] lot of guests already and some research
[71:40] but yeah you don't need to be educated
[71:42] you just need to use it like uh don't we
[71:46] should get out of this uh theoretical
[71:49] type of things and just like I told you
[71:51] I I I will not tell you go research
[71:54] Noster I'm telling you go do stuff go
[71:58] apply things and uh just like that use
[72:01] the lightning Network and see what are
[72:03] the limitations the benefits and
[72:05] everything else and use it for your best
[72:09] uh user experience that you want to have
[72:11] and the problems that you want to solve
[72:13] we should get out of the podcast addtion
[72:17] that uh oh we need to talk about it no
[72:20] go do stuff proof of work uh that's uh
[72:23] that's very true uh just that's just
[72:25] trying it out perfect then um the last
[72:29] question uh is always the same question
[72:31] for every guest um before the before the
[72:34] end routine there's a new question
[72:36] actually um so the question always for
[72:39] the same guest is what can we learn from
[72:41] you besides all the things that you
[72:43] already talked about on the podcast uh
[72:46] to learn from me uh anything or like
[72:50] yeah like uh I I want to to get
[72:52] something that we didn't heard already
[72:54] so like what can we learn from you uh
[72:57] whatever it is besides all the things
[73:00] like all besides Bitcoin besides
[73:02] lightning besides all those things uh I
[73:06] would say uh I talked about it in a few
[73:10] other pocast but we definitely didn't
[73:12] speak uh about it with you is that if
[73:16] you don't start uh with writing a list
[73:20] with your life goals that let's say I
[73:24] want a house I want a car I want
[73:26] vacations it does not matter but if you
[73:29] don't start there even if you're a
[73:31] bitcoiner you're not going to have the
[73:34] life that you want you should start with
[73:37] the list and the goals that you have for
[73:40] your life and you use this Bitcoin thing
[73:45] that will get you there faster than
[73:47] anything else and when you have that
[73:50] list you will know when to spend your
[73:54] Bitcoin because you thought about what
[73:57] your life should be you should not be
[73:59] the richest man in the grave with the
[74:01] Bitcoin and everything that everybody
[74:03] promotes H till you die and then after
[74:05] so uh the other people will benefit from
[74:08] you dying that's the wrong thing you
[74:12] should Chase and achieve the life that
[74:15] you want to have but if you never
[74:17] actually set those goals you're no never
[74:20] going to get there even if you have
[74:22] Bitcoin love that a lot you have to
[74:24] write it down
[74:25] yeah really cool um now the end routine
[74:28] of the podcast where the previous guest
[74:29] is asking a question for the next guest
[74:30] without knowing who the next guest
[74:32] actually is your question from the
[74:34] previous guest is do you think there is
[74:36] any risk for Bitcoin not to become
[74:38] mainstream and what can we bitcoiners do
[74:41] to make sure Bitcoin actually becomes
[74:43] mainstream I would say uh in the long
[74:47] term there is no risk because as we said
[74:50] even the bad outcomes because there's no
[74:52] bailouts in uh Bitcoin even if people
[74:56] die uh the like in Lebanon through Fiat
[75:00] infrastructures or whatever people are
[75:02] stolen from uh the Bitcoin ecosystem
[75:05] like uh that is life that uh people die
[75:11] accidents happens but you are allowed to
[75:13] that is entropy and that is part of life
[75:15] because if you want to have the new you
[75:17] have to get rid of the things that are
[75:19] not secure uh and I I'm not worried
[75:25] about if we're going to have
[75:26] hyperbitcoinization I'm worried if
[75:29] people are uh going to get tracked by
[75:32] not knowing what they're doing uh so uh
[75:37] either it takes a long time uh
[75:40] through they really capture Us by 2%
[75:43] inflation and they create this
[75:45] infrastructure of the Bitcoin dollar
[75:47] slowly because if they create it fast
[75:49] and let's say they uh start buying
[75:52] Bitcoin today and Bitcoin shoots 1
[75:55] million in a few months a lot of people
[75:58] will wake up and start searching the
[76:00] results I think they in order to capture
[76:03] us they have to do it slowly uh so they
[76:05] can get bought but even then they will
[76:09] get wrecked at some point and people
[76:12] will learn the most harsh way so I'm not
[76:15] worried about that and I'm not worried
[76:18] because in order to not even get there
[76:21] just build that is the proof of work
[76:24] stop St waiting for Bitcoin to become a
[76:26] million and again start with the list of
[76:29] your life goals and start putting it on
[76:32] top of the Bitcoin infrastructure stop
[76:34] thinking in Fiat terms start thinking in
[76:38] a Bitcoin mindset I love it a lot really
[76:40] cool uh thank you so much uh even for
[76:43] being on already um where can people
[76:45] find you where can people ask you
