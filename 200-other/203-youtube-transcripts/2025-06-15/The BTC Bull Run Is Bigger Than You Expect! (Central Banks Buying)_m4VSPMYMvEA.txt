[00:00] it's much easier to just gradually steal
[00:03] people's wealth and blame it on that
[00:05] foreign dictator or that war or the
[00:07] billionaires or greedy business people
[00:10] none of those things are true it is just
[00:12] the money printer the central banks
[00:13] caused the booms and busts by their
[00:16] actions but they'll justify their
[00:18] presence to protect us against the booms
[00:20] and the bus it is just absolutely
[00:22] ludicrous if we were going to sit down
[00:24] and play a board game right now you and
[00:25] me and I got to change the rules
[00:27] whenever I want who's going to win that
[00:28] board game why would you let somebody do
[00:30] that with the money you're inevitably
[00:31] going to do it's the peaceful Uptown
[00:34] into a new system where the whole world
[00:36] is working 24/7 to increase your
[00:38] purchasing power the natural consequence
[00:40] of Game Theory here is you use the money
[00:41] printer to to print money to buy Bitcoin
[00:44] cuz it's the only way out the world is
[00:45] going to bitcoin so you are incredibly
[00:48] well positioned to make a real
[00:50] difference the Strategic Bitcoin reserve
[00:53] for any country should be the Bitcoin
[00:55] that its population holds not what the
[00:57] government holds print fiat currency to
[00:59] buy Bitcoin and then put that Bitcoin in
[01:00] the hands of everyone in the population
[01:02] not on the balance sheet at
[01:03] [Music]
[01:08] Central uh you made an video that was uh
[01:11] for a few days all over my feet um I
[01:14] think even like really big ones like
[01:15] Micha and all of those have kind of
[01:17] retreated and and and kind of shared it
[01:19] in their audiences um and I love the the
[01:23] phrasing of it there there was no
[01:25] Bitcoin in it there was like no Bitcoin
[01:27] in the title uh so you're just like oh
[01:29] like what's what's the problem uh how
[01:31] did it come to that video and and how
[01:33] did it come to
[01:34] that um we it's very it was very much an
[01:38] accidental creation Robin I would say
[01:39] that up up front um and I couldn't have
[01:43] expected the level of response from the
[01:46] Bitcoin community and to end up having
[01:49] Michael sailor post it and Ryan
[01:51] Armstrong basically state that Bitcoin
[01:53] is a moral imperative in response to the
[01:56] video and you know that's like Fair
[01:59] fairy tale stuff um and you know I'm I'm
[02:03] Blown Away by it um and I'm very
[02:05] grateful for everyone in the in the
[02:07] community taking time to watch it and if
[02:09] you haven't watched it please do watch
[02:10] it and then share it with your friends
[02:12] um but it I didn't set out to create a
[02:16] video I just wanted to put together a
[02:19] presentation for some friends because I
[02:21] I was attending uh I was invited to a
[02:24] weekend away by a friend and he invited
[02:28] uh 15 of us I didn't know anyone else
[02:30] going and he asked us all to bring
[02:31] something to talk about and I want to
[02:33] talk about Bitcoin but half an hour and
[02:36] so I wanted
[02:38] to uh put something together where the
[02:41] aim of the 30 minutes was not to teach
[02:43] people about Bitcoin but to have them at
[02:46] the end of the 30 minutes want to learn
[02:47] about
[02:48] Bitcoin and so you
[02:51] know perfect yeah I just wanted to put
[02:54] it up there so people can easily find it
[02:56] it's like it's called what's the problem
[02:58] demystifying why we all need Bitcoin
[03:00] from TR Brian so like uh we have TR
[03:03] Brian here uh for for those who
[03:06] wondering uh and that's uh it's a really
[03:08] great video and uh it it I mean it's it
[03:11] speaks volumes that like uh from out of
[03:14] nowhere the video made so much waves in
[03:18] the Bitcoin community so uh it's it's
[03:20] something that uh you you kind of should
[03:24] look at uh because it might be a really
[03:26] good orange pilling material for for
[03:28] people that are like like why why even
[03:31] why even border looking into into
[03:33] Bitcoin so I like what what you did
[03:34] there yeah yeah thank you it's um yeah I
[03:39] just when I give I knew I was on the
[03:41] right sort of track and I was excited
[03:43] about giving the presentation to to this
[03:45] this group of people who had never met
[03:47] before but the reaction was like
[03:49] something I've never had before because
[03:51] you spend a lot of time talking to
[03:52] people about Bitcoin and trying to
[03:55] evangelize and help them fig have the
[03:58] penny drop for
[04:00] themselves right
[04:02] um but we sort of all come at it from
[04:04] different angles depending on the person
[04:06] we're speaking to and quite often we
[04:07] just talk past people because we're so
[04:09] far down the rabbit hole communicating
[04:12] effectively back with somebody who
[04:14] hasn't even got a mental framework on
[04:17] which to hand to hang some of the
[04:19] concepts and some of the issues that
[04:20] you're that you're flagging to them as
[04:22] being the rational why you are a
[04:26] bitcoiner it just makes it very very
[04:28] hard and so yeah this video is the sort
[04:32] of thing you can send to your your mom
[04:35] or dad or your grandparent or your child
[04:39] and you can sit down and watch it and
[04:42] they don't need to know anything about
[04:45] anything other than just being a human
[04:47] being and experiencing the world around
[04:49] them and they go from you know talking
[04:53] about because we don't don't even frame
[04:55] it as Bitcoin it's just what's the
[04:57] problem and Bitcoin is only mentioned
[04:58] right at the end and so by going through
[05:01] it you begin to understand why the world
[05:04] around you is the way it
[05:06] is the and and what the issue what the
[05:09] issue at the heart of everything is and
[05:11] once you understand what the issue is
[05:13] then you're and and you do this through
[05:17] a series of logical steps that you do as
[05:19] the viewer it's not being told it's a
[05:22] story and you and every stage you're
[05:24] like yeah okay that's that makes sense
[05:26] that makes sense and then you end up in
[05:27] a situation where it's very clear
[05:30] something is wrong right and now that
[05:33] now I've in my own head as somebody who
[05:35] knows nothing about Bitcoin recognizes
[05:37] there's a problem my next question is
[05:39] okay well what's the
[05:40] solution and that's and that's when you
[05:43] introduce
[05:44] Bitcoin it's I love that approach
[05:46] because I think a lot of people are not
[05:48] aware of the problem you like a lot of
[05:50] people are still like oh like it's it's
[05:53] fine we have inflation but it's just
[05:55] temporary and like it will come down and
[05:57] like they're not aware of the the real
[06:00] underlying problem they still say like
[06:02] oh like yeah of course we have some war
[06:04] in Ukraine that's where we have
[06:05] inflation stuff like
[06:07] that they they not this inflation
[06:09] obviously uh people are not stupid but
[06:12] they kind of it's it's it's not in front
[06:15] of their mind what what the real problem
[06:17] is and and why they should now look into
[06:20] a solution they don't they don't even
[06:21] look for a solution they they might look
[06:23] for like oh like maybe I should have a
[06:25] salary increase and and stuff like that
[06:27] but what are the the real CA of
[06:30] absolutely and and people people are
[06:33] accepting of inflation now inflation we
[06:36] have have been in
[06:39] the the water that's gradually boiling
[06:42] for so long that people have no no
[06:45] conception of a world that didn't have
[06:48] inflation it's almost like the inflation
[06:50] is just the natural state of the world
[06:52] and so yeah it's it's it eats away our
[06:55] savings but that's just the way that's
[06:57] just the way it is because that's the
[06:59] natural state
[07:00] but it's absolutely not the case that
[07:02] it's the Natural State it's an
[07:03] engineered
[07:05] State um and you know the the the video
[07:09] helps people go from understanding where
[07:12] inflation comes
[07:14] from and then seeing what the
[07:16] consequences are that then impact their
[07:18] own lives which are second order third
[07:20] order which they would have no idea
[07:22] about connecting the dots back to
[07:25] inflation and ultimately back to the
[07:27] money printer and so the story is about
[07:30] you know an island that splits into two
[07:31] and on one side you got satosi in
[07:33] perfect money on the other side you've
[07:34] got
[07:35] fiello who has perfect money but he has
[07:38] a big red button and he can press the
[07:39] button whenever he wants to change
[07:41] aspects of the money and basically just
[07:42] keeps pressing it printing more money
[07:44] for the government and then the whole
[07:46] island just you know have this cascading
[07:49] effect of this then this then this and
[07:51] you end up in a position where it just
[07:53] looks like today it's just like today
[07:55] and then people are suddenly like okay
[07:56] well it's the money printer it's the
[07:58] fact the government has this Big R
[08:00] is where the inflation comes from this
[08:02] is an active choice this is not the
[08:05] natural state of the the free market and
[08:08] so like once you make that
[08:10] connection which is much easier in story
[08:12] form you know and you have the mental
[08:14] picture of like a Pixar character
[08:16] pressing a big red button and changing
[08:18] stuff it's much easier to sort of
[08:20] abstract away the inner workings of the
[08:22] complexities of the financial
[08:24] system behind that little
[08:27] image than it is you know to try and
[08:29] explain how how banking system works and
[08:32] you know quantitative easing and you
[08:35] know debasement and all and all of these
[08:37] things but yeah inflation is just
[08:40] Insidious and it destroys everything but
[08:43] people people just are used to it they
[08:46] think it's natural and that that's
[08:48] that's the biggest challenge here if we
[08:49] can wait people up to that then
[08:51] everything else flows naturally because
[08:52] you and I both know is that once that
[08:55] once you reach that firm understanding
[08:58] you inevitably end up qu inevitably it's
[09:01] just a question of it's just a question
[09:03] there are so many interesting questions
[09:04] in there because if we look at how they
[09:07] like first of all I'm shocked that they
[09:08] still accept fear uh but then it's like
[09:11] oh like what needs to happen that the
[09:14] general population is no longer
[09:16] accepting fear like what is the
[09:18] inflation rate we still have in Turkey
[09:20] like massive inflation or in other
[09:23] countries even like Argentina where they
[09:25] just invent new currencies every five 10
[09:28] years uh and people just accept it it's
[09:31] it's it's it's kind of shocking what
[09:33] what has to happen that people are go
[09:35] like oh like oh feeld obviously is bad
[09:38] well single digit inflation
[09:40] rates don't trigger protests in the
[09:43] streets and you know it's much
[09:47] easier to just gradually steal people's
[09:50] wealth and blame it on that foreign
[09:54] dictator or that war or the billionaires
[09:57] or greedy business people all of all of
[10:00] these things which you know none of
[10:01] those things are true it is just the
[10:04] money printer that is Drive is the
[10:06] source of source of inflation but nobody
[10:09] has uh nobody alive
[10:12] today apart from some people who are
[10:15] probably very old now have a conception
[10:17] of what life was like before this was
[10:19] the case before the start of before 1971
[10:22] even before you know when they started
[10:24] abusing the moneu printer and hadn't
[10:25] been found out
[10:27] yet it's like it's such a foreign such a
[10:29] foreign
[10:30] concept but you if it it's not
[10:33] surprising that the the population are
[10:35] just toly accepting of this
[10:37] because a it's
[10:40] complex B it's OB fiscated from the
[10:43] population C no you're not even educated
[10:47] in it you're actively
[10:50] educated in the opposite direction by
[10:53] the by the state and modern
[10:56] economics I mean the the the concept
[10:58] that we have have a series of men sat
[11:01] around the table I say men because it is
[11:03] almost entirely men sat around the table
[11:06] deciding what monetary policy should
[11:09] be is you know and and fixing the price
[11:11] of money to try and
[11:14] change uh inflation which is a backdated
[11:18] measure which they which is corrupted
[11:20] anyway to try and um ensure stability in
[11:24] the financial system while
[11:27] simultaneously stealing small percentage
[11:30] of of the purchasing power every single
[11:32] year from everybody it's just ludicrous
[11:35] I mean it's it's the equivalent of doing
[11:37] you know
[11:39] uh like living in Aztec times and
[11:42] sacrificing people to the you know you
[11:45] know some of the weather gods or the Sun
[11:47] or something it's like you know your
[11:50] framework and foundations of these
[11:51] things just totally Bonkers totally
[11:54] bunkers you know the the the the human
[11:57] intervention in the price of money
[12:00] causes the problems that they themselves
[12:02] hold up as um the rationale for their
[12:06] existence trying to solve them so the
[12:08] central banks caus the the um booms and
[12:12] busts by their actions that they'll
[12:14] justify their
[12:17] presence to to to protect us against the
[12:20] booms and the Buss it is just absolutely
[12:23] ludicrous but there is no foundation for
[12:26] the general population to understand
[12:28] that and no one and the state is clearly
[12:31] not motivated to educate anybody in in
[12:34] the critical thinking around questioning
[12:36] this in to any degree and so you has to
[12:39] be a bottom up a bottom up movement and
[12:42] you know the natural Roots end up in
[12:44] Bitcoin you know the people who' have
[12:46] gone down that rabbit hole and
[12:47] questioned these things and and employed
[12:49] critical thinking and there are a lot of
[12:51] us a lot of us who have done it
[12:54] independently right and arrived at the
[12:56] same conclusion it has to start from
[12:58] there so you know I was like my question
[13:00] you know one of the things I've always
[13:02] thought about is like how do we expand
[13:03] the Bitcoin bubble how do you get as
[13:06] many people to that starting
[13:08] point with going down the Bitcoin Rabbit
[13:11] Hole as possible because once once you
[13:14] start going down like you're never
[13:16] coming out again you're never coming out
[13:18] again and everyone will eventually get
[13:20] there so let's just try and get there as
[13:21] quickly as possible with as many people
[13:23] as possible in as many different parts
[13:24] of the world as possible um and I hope
[13:27] the video is go some way to
[13:30] someone to help him what impact do you
[13:32] think money has uh on on us humans on us
[13:37] on on on on the on the global society
[13:39] when when we use fear versus when we use
[13:41] when you use Bitcoin I mean it's
[13:44] corrosive you can look at pretty much
[13:45] any aspect of our society
[13:48] and it's worse than it was 20 years ago
[13:52] 50 years
[13:54] ago everything it just it corrupts
[13:57] decision making
[14:00] if you corrupt the money you you corrupt
[14:02] the price
[14:03] signals and if your price signals are
[14:05] corrupted everything everything you
[14:08] can't make you can't make a decision
[14:11] with
[14:11] confidence you your decision making is
[14:15] Led is led by the system and you're
[14:19] constantly trying to protect yourself
[14:21] against the system if if if you figured
[14:23] it out if you figured it out and if you
[14:26] haven't figured it out you're just
[14:28] trying to survive in the best way you
[14:32] can but you're constantly on the losing
[14:34] side and it's just a question of how
[14:36] much you're losing
[14:37] by because you can you can never unless
[14:40] you're are unless you're connected to
[14:42] the money printer or connected to the
[14:44] people connected to the money printer
[14:46] you cannot win in the
[14:48] system it's only just a question of how
[14:50] much you're going to lose by and it and
[14:52] and it it's not just the money it
[14:53] impacts impacts
[14:55] everything Health
[14:57] families you you know mentality
[15:00] motivation ethics just everything
[15:03] absolutely
[15:04] everything but what would you expect
[15:06] when the you
[15:07] know the center of everything is is
[15:13] cancerous and and and money we we we
[15:16] need every every day we we transact of
[15:19] it that's like it's almost like a
[15:21] language between human being it's his
[15:23] information and uh when this is
[15:27] disrupted it's it's so fundamental and I
[15:29] love how you described it of like if if
[15:31] you're not the money printer or you
[15:33] don't have connection to the money
[15:34] printer it's it's like a pyramid scheme
[15:36] where the closer you are to to to the
[15:40] money printer the lower the cost for you
[15:43] to produce more money is and the the
[15:46] better your chances are to get ahead in
[15:48] life which this shouldn't be money that
[15:51] should not be the case of of uh our
[15:55] fundamental monetary system yeah AB
[15:58] abely absolutely and and you know
[16:02] you I've had a lot of conversations with
[16:04] a lot of people especially since since
[16:06] launching the the video and not all of
[16:09] them within
[16:10] Bitcoin and you know I've spoken to a
[16:13] number of people who are still very much
[16:15] in the fat in the fat system and you'd
[16:19] be I don't I say you'd be surprised but
[16:22] maybe you're not surprised like someone
[16:24] even said to me but inflation's a good
[16:25] thing and I I just sort of I like fell
[16:29] off my chair and I was
[16:30] like why why is that good thing he said
[16:34] but you know without inflation you
[16:35] people wouldn't be encouraged to spend
[16:37] and and he's
[16:39] okay but like just just just question
[16:41] the principles behind that like you you
[16:43] think that the government been able to
[16:44] steal purchasing power is a good thing
[16:46] because it encourages people to try and
[16:47] get rid of their money as quickly as
[16:49] possible because it's decaying like how
[16:50] is that how is that a stable foundation
[16:53] for any long long-term real growth in
[16:57] any in any economy
[16:59] and I I sort of framed it to them you
[17:01] know because we we've watched the video
[17:03] and and I was we can talk about a bit
[17:06] more of that conversation in a minute
[17:07] but the we watched the video and in the
[17:09] video FIA tell is there pressing
[17:11] pressing the big red button and he
[17:12] basically gets to change the rules
[17:14] whenever he wants and the money and I
[17:15] said to him look if we forget about the
[17:17] money if we were going to sit down and
[17:20] play a board game right now you and me
[17:22] and I got to change the rules whenever I
[17:24] want who's going to win that board game
[17:27] and he said well you are obviously okay
[17:29] well so who's going to
[17:30] lose I'm going to lose okay so why would
[17:33] you let somebody do that with the money
[17:35] you're inevitably going to
[17:36] lose unless you're in charge of the big
[17:39] red
[17:39] buttons so how is that how is that a
[17:42] stable basis for anything and I think
[17:45] it's very hard to to argue against that
[17:47] sort of
[17:48] simplification because it doesn't matter
[17:50] that you can argue about this particular
[17:52] aspect of that particular but just
[17:55] structurally you are going to lose and
[17:57] so why would you ever want want to play
[17:59] the game it's a beautiful explanation
[18:01] with the um with the big red button it's
[18:04] it makes it simple of people for
[18:08] understanding like okay that that
[18:10] there's someone that can manipulate the
[18:12] game because now they think yeah like
[18:15] it's it's normal we we kind of need that
[18:18] one instance that gives us the money
[18:21] they don't think as the central bank as
[18:23] a normal actor in the game they think as
[18:27] as the as from the central bank like
[18:29] almost a rule set for the game uh it's
[18:31] the one that comes with it uh but that
[18:34] that's just a a weird way to look at it
[18:37] and the right ways to look at it they
[18:39] they are also just an organization they
[18:41] are also just human beings uh that they
[18:44] are all the same basically just that
[18:47] they are for some reason allowed to
[18:50] manipulate our our money um and the
[18:54] crazy thing is nowadays you don't even
[18:57] have to accept it like even if you're in
[18:59] the EU uh where there's so many strict
[19:01] rules about everything you can live
[19:03] completely unbanked there are Services
[19:05] where you can live on a Bitcoin standard
[19:08] and when you have to pay some someone uh
[19:11] like your landlord in in the banking
[19:13] system or something like that you just
[19:15] pay them with lightning or with Bitcoin
[19:17] gets transferred and they get the Euros
[19:19] in their own bank account and so we
[19:22] already have an alternative you can
[19:24] already opt out of the
[19:25] system uh and you don't have to play by
[19:28] those rules
[19:29] you you don't have to play by a by a
[19:32] manipulated um but riged game that you
[19:36] have to lose you you hold Euros you will
[19:39] lose you hold fed you will lose it's but
[19:42] it's a real challenge for people and you
[19:45] even within the Bitcoin Community it's
[19:46] very hard to live on the Bitcoin
[19:49] standard you know very
[19:51] because you know tools Services people
[19:55] willing to accept Bitcoin you know it
[19:58] it's it's easier for some than
[20:01] others you know and it's hard you know
[20:02] when you have a family and you know
[20:04] because there's you a whole different
[20:06] range of services and things like that
[20:08] that you and different countries that it
[20:10] then makes it very
[20:12] hard but the fact that you can do that
[20:14] these days is is fantastic and more and
[20:17] more people will be able to do that over
[20:18] time as education increases but also the
[20:22] ease of executing these things and the
[20:24] banking system hopefully now that things
[20:26] have changed Direction slightly in the
[20:28] US dramatically in the US hopefully that
[20:30] now encourages Europe and the UK
[20:33] especially to adopt a less aggressive
[20:36] less suicidal approach when it comes to
[20:40] you know um their treatment of Bitcoin
[20:43] and the people who use Bitcoin but I
[20:44] think the direction of travel overall
[20:45] Globe is is a good one it's just going
[20:47] to take us time take us time to get
[20:48] there but to come back to to what you
[20:50] were saying around you know the central
[20:54] banks I think people view them as being
[20:56] independent
[20:58] and as the rule set as not an active
[21:02] participant in the in the
[21:05] system is that appeal to that higher
[21:07] authority especially when you're not
[21:10] when you haven't done the work it's like
[21:13] you know I don't trust you people would
[21:15] say I don't trust the government but the
[21:16] but the Central Bank are they're
[21:18] independent they've got our best
[21:19] interests at heart you know but the but
[21:23] but the reality is you know the people
[21:26] who are in the Central Bank probably do
[21:27] feel that that is the case but but the
[21:31] reality is they are human
[21:32] beings and we are in a debt based
[21:36] system and they can't they can't allow
[21:38] things to fail so you know whenever
[21:41] whenever something does go wrong they're
[21:44] forced to pull the trigger and bail
[21:46] everybody out and it's combination is
[21:48] that psychological pressure on them you
[21:50] know they're human beings they also have
[21:52] assets they have they have Investments
[21:55] they have families they don't want to
[21:56] see those Investments Falling by
[21:59] you have the political pressure as well
[22:01] and then you know you have the you know
[22:03] just the General Social pressure it's
[22:06] inevitable it's inevitable it's like
[22:08] fiell and he has that big red button you
[22:10] know there's a line where there's an
[22:13] incentive there whether explicit or
[22:16] implicit that he'll press the big red
[22:18] button at some point and just press and
[22:20] print the money is the fact that they
[22:21] have this ability means it will get
[22:25] used because there will be an emergency
[22:28] at some point point which probably they
[22:30] have
[22:32] precipitated through through previous
[22:36] actions as you know try it's like it's
[22:39] like trying to steer a car yeah it's
[22:40] like it's like imagine trying to reverse
[22:43] a car in the dark on Ice where you all
[22:48] you get to see is the position of the
[22:50] car two minutes ago right and trying to
[22:53] keep control of it like that's basically
[22:56] what central bank is doing they're
[22:58] trying to set the price of money to to
[23:01] minimize the variance in the
[23:03] economy by using backward looking
[23:07] signals on a framework on a keian
[23:09] framework that is just just totally
[23:12] Bonkers and no wonder it's like
[23:15] constantly like we'll tweak it this way
[23:16] we'll tweak it this way and you just
[23:18] introduce more and more oscillations in
[23:19] the system and then you have to hit the
[23:21] bed bid rub button to bail everybody out
[23:23] and then it's rinse and repeat it it's
[23:25] just a natural consequence of the system
[23:27] but I don't think the individually would
[23:29] consider themselves to be bad actors I
[23:31] think it's just the ability of them to
[23:34] have access to a big red button to
[23:35] change anything they want is something
[23:38] that should just not not be the case
[23:41] it's amazing and yesterday the podcast
[23:43] with fck um who a system engineer uh and
[23:47] he's really big on like how an airplane
[23:51] is staying stable how car is staying
[23:53] stable and how how things have natural
[23:57] stability like if you drive a car
[23:59] forward uh even if you leave the the
[24:02] steering wheel it will naturally go in
[24:04] One Direction it has a natural stability
[24:06] to it and uh we talked about the same
[24:10] concept with feat it has a naturally
[24:12] instability uh it's always it's it's
[24:15] it's like a car that is um um doing I
[24:21] don't know how it's called in English
[24:22] when when the the kai is turning out
[24:24] right and left it's like this fish uh
[24:27] turning right and left on the back end
[24:30] where at some point um you can control
[24:33] it if you're a skilled driver but at
[24:36] some point physics comes in and all of a
[24:39] sudden no matter what you do in the car
[24:41] this car will just turn around and you
[24:42] will crash and and you will uh uh be
[24:46] somewhere in the woods and somewhere in
[24:47] a tree in there with your car because at
[24:50] some point physics comes in and then the
[24:54] comparison to fear it's like yes you can
[24:56] control the money supply you can control
[24:57] Maybe inflation rate to a certain extent
[25:00] but at some point physics comes in some
[25:03] point this whole thing will collapse
[25:05] because it's not controllable anymore
[25:07] it's it's like that in in it's a Rand
[25:13] quote it's like you can
[25:16] ignore reality for as long as you like
[25:19] but you can't ignore the consequences of
[25:21] ignoring reality absolutely and so you
[25:24] know this this is the Fiat system this
[25:26] is the Fiat system you cannot have a
[25:28] free market in the Fiat system because
[25:31] price price Evolution can is only
[25:33] allowed in one direction for assets over
[25:36] the long run because it's a debt based
[25:38] system the central banks cannot allow
[25:41] asset prices to fall because everything
[25:45] implodes they can fall a little
[25:47] bit but anytime they fall too much they
[25:51] have to prop them
[25:52] up again by expanding the monetary
[25:55] Supply by hitting that big red button
[25:57] and so it is just a one-way trade which
[26:00] means it's not free market and you play
[26:02] that forward
[26:03] inevitably you get to infinite fear
[26:07] that's the only outcome that's the only
[26:08] outcome in that
[26:09] scenario and so if that's the only
[26:12] outcome with the with the rules of the
[26:14] game and you know they're never going to
[26:16] further constrain themselves with the
[26:17] rules of the game it's just a question
[26:20] of how long it takes to you to you reach
[26:22] infinite fear and if you know you're
[26:23] going to get there then you've just got
[26:24] to own the hardest asset in the universe
[26:27] and it's just a question
[26:28] time and so yeah I mean the fear system
[26:31] is just inherently broken and unstable
[26:35] it's it's it's almost interesting
[26:37] how people really hate on politicians
[26:41] and really hate on like oh what policies
[26:45] they they they do but with politicians
[26:48] at least you kind of have a vote like
[26:51] you kind of have a vot of like who do
[26:53] you want in office I mean in America
[26:55] it's a different approach because I
[26:57] think just two parties
[26:58] um I see it especially in Europe and in
[27:01] Austria in countries where there are
[27:03] like three four five parties where you
[27:05] actually kind of have a choice and the
[27:07] biggest party only have like 25% of the
[27:09] votes uh where you kind of really say
[27:12] like okay I want the more uh libertarian
[27:16] economic friendly uh government I want
[27:18] to have like maybe a green party in
[27:20] there I want to have like conservatives
[27:22] I want to have like right wing like they
[27:23] are like really like five IDE
[27:26] ideological differently different
[27:28] parties in there that you can vote for
[27:32] and what you vote you usually also kind
[27:34] of get that might be different in
[27:36] America because there's like a two-
[27:38] party system that might be a little um
[27:40] little weird um but still as Central
[27:44] Bank we never voted for them we we don't
[27:48] vote on the persons that are on the
[27:50] central bank and we don't vote on the
[27:51] policies that the central bank is doing
[27:54] but we do accept them and we only hate
[27:57] on politicians like how does this make
[27:59] sense where where we have some sort of
[28:01] control we hate on them where we don't
[28:03] even have a little bit inside little bit
[28:05] control and completely intransparent we
[28:08] kind of just leave it there like nobody
[28:10] goes on streets and protest all the fat
[28:12] like some do but like very small amand
[28:17] it's it's a great it's a great question
[28:20] I think it's
[28:21] the the positioning is of
[28:24] Independence
[28:26] perhaps is that PO ically
[28:29] neutral actor politically neutral actor
[28:33] in the in the
[28:35] system whereas in politics it's very
[28:38] much our team versus your
[28:40] team
[28:41] mentality
[28:43] and yeah maybe that goes some way to
[28:45] some way to explain it but you know it's
[28:48] it's like a lot of the EU now
[28:52] especially you never voted for any of
[28:54] this stuff you're just subject to it and
[28:57] there is there is no there is no
[29:00] mechanism to leave apart from Absolut on
[29:04] Mig
[29:05] great go to leave Europe that's the only
[29:08] pretty much the only way that you can
[29:09] escape what is what is happening it is
[29:13] uh yeah it's it's evolved in quite a
[29:16] scary Direction over the last over the
[29:18] last 10 years 100% where where are you
[29:21] actually based are you in America or in
[29:23] Europe no I wish I was in America I'm me
[29:25] I'm in I'm in the UK just outside London
[29:28] okay uh why would you wish to America
[29:31] you you don't like UK's
[29:33] direction oh UK is going a terrible
[29:35] Direction um you know I'm
[29:38] very very proud to be from the UK you
[29:43] know we are you know I'm very proud to
[29:46] be from the UK but we have some very
[29:49] very strange
[29:50] ideas when it comes to thinking about
[29:54] the responsibilities that we have and
[29:57] plans for the future it's you know I
[30:00] look at politicians in the US and there
[30:04] was definitely a mixed bag definitely a
[30:06] mixed bag of quality and you may not
[30:08] agree with everything or anything that
[30:10] either side say but what is drastically
[30:13] different versus the
[30:15] UK is that it's full of business people
[30:17] UK we have nobody there's nobody who's a
[30:20] business person in the UK government we
[30:23] have you know we've ended up in a
[30:26] situation where we have career
[30:27] politicians
[30:29] of one degree or another who have very
[30:31] little little to no experience in the
[30:33] real world let alone running a business
[30:35] and having to make decisions having to
[30:37] allocate Capital manage people manage
[30:40] risk think about growth in instead We've
[30:44] Ended up
[30:45] with with a party and and this this this
[30:49] also applies to conservatives and and
[30:51] and reforming and others to it to to
[30:54] varying degrees as well but especially
[30:57] with laboring the in the UK and we have
[31:00] ended up in
[31:02] just a situation where we've got four
[31:05] years of decline ahead of us um because
[31:09] the whole foundations on which we think
[31:12] about prosperity and the creation of
[31:14] prosperity it's just just just totally
[31:18] backwards totally backwards to to think
[31:20] that you can tax people into Prosperity
[31:23] is is just it's just ludicrous it's just
[31:25] ludicrous and there is no I mean this is
[31:28] not just a Bitcoin thing because Bitcoin
[31:29] is not given the given the foundations
[31:33] to succeed in the UK to the extent that
[31:36] it should being the
[31:38] civilizational level change you know
[31:41] within technology that it
[31:43] is um but even even just more broadly
[31:46] the wealth creators and small businesses
[31:49] medium businesses large businesses
[31:50] across the UK are are increasingly
[31:52] treated as the enemy or the the um the
[31:58] cattle to extract as much out of as
[32:01] possible for
[32:04] the to be to provide resources to be
[32:07] poured into the black hole by the
[32:09] state and there was Zero
[32:11] accountability on on the side of the
[32:14] state on spending it's all about you
[32:16] know people need to pay their fair share
[32:18] and these sorts of things but you know
[32:20] what is your fair share of what someone
[32:22] else worked for your faes share is zero
[32:26] of what someone else worked for
[32:28] and you know the best capital allocators
[32:31] and the best drivers of growth in any
[32:32] economy are the entrepreneurs are the
[32:34] business people and you should be trying
[32:36] to put more Capital back in the hands of
[32:38] capital allocators to create more growth
[32:42] more um more jobs more prosperity and
[32:45] raise the standard of living for the
[32:46] people in your country rather than
[32:49] trying to take more out of their hands
[32:51] to pour into the
[32:52] blackcool and you know we are that's the
[32:54] situation we find ourselves in and I
[32:56] realize it's not just the UK it's it's
[32:58] everywhere um but the UK we are on a
[33:01] particularly dark path and you know I I
[33:04] really hope that not at some point we
[33:08] get somebody in the cabinet who at least
[33:10] has some business background experience
[33:13] some real world experience in managing
[33:16] budgets thinking about Capital
[33:17] allocation growth and not just scoring
[33:20] political points and writing checks to
[33:24] anyone and everything I partnered up
[33:27] with coin vigilante this is the most

[35:34] how you can level up your sovereignty
[35:37] it's always like there's a there's some
[35:38] sort of cycle to it like there's uh
[35:41] business people and and entrepreneurs
[35:43] that kind of build up uh wealth with
[35:47] bringing jobs and bringing prosperity to
[35:49] a country and once there's a lot of
[35:51] prosperity in in in the county country
[35:55] people are having higher problems of
[35:58] like oh now that we're kind of wealthy
[36:01] we want to have social things we want to
[36:03] have equality like equality I hate that
[36:07] word but like you know what I'm talking
[36:11] about there like the Socialist then
[36:13] agenda coming in uh and this then leads
[36:16] to policies that actually drive out the
[36:19] the businessman and the business people
[36:21] and the
[36:21] entrepreneurs uh especially those who
[36:24] make new companies they're looking at
[36:26] that like oh like here I'm getting
[36:28] punished for creating something at that
[36:30] country I'm not getting punished so why
[36:32] I'm not just starting over there when
[36:34] I'm getting punished here to do
[36:36] something and I think that's like where
[36:38] there's this this cycle continuous of
[36:41] of uh when when you go in the wrong
[36:44] direction once and you go in the
[36:46] Socialist Direction uh you are driving
[36:49] out a lot of capital A lot of talent and
[36:52] a lot of entrepreneurs those Capital
[36:55] entrepreneurs and talent make sure that
[36:58] the Next Generation has wealth if
[37:00] without them everything is breaking down
[37:02] like you don't have tax money to give
[37:05] anyone if there are no companies there
[37:07] like that's the fundamental thing that
[37:09] you need in an an economy and you need
[37:11] in a society 100% And and this is you
[37:14] know that's why I would want to be in
[37:15] America that's why I would want to be in
[37:18] America you know in in
[37:21] America from here not America for the
[37:24] last four years but you know some areas
[37:27] you know obviously very protective of of
[37:30] the rights of individuals and remain
[37:33] capitalist in the truest sense of the
[37:35] way that you can within a Fiat system
[37:38] noting all the things we talked about
[37:39] before which distort all of those things
[37:41] us is set up to be the home of I mean
[37:44] it's it always been the home of this but
[37:47] now it's it's it's positioned as such
[37:51] a radically different proposition from
[37:54] where Europe is from where the US is
[37:57] there were where the UK is um why would
[38:00] you not want to be there why would you
[38:02] not want to be there and you know it's
[38:05] probably the one location in the world
[38:07] and I I sort of parenthesis but
[38:09] parenthesis around you know they're out
[38:11] of the smaller Pockets around the world
[38:12] but as you know as a whole country
[38:15] where you probably have the most direct
[38:18] link
[38:20] between effort and reward as an
[38:23] individual you want
[38:25] to have purpose be motivated
[38:27] improve the life for your family and and
[38:30] drive success and help people very
[38:33] generally
[38:35] speaking but if the mechanism for the
[38:38] creativity The Innovation the effort
[38:40] that you put in that mechanism between
[38:43] that and what comes out the other end of
[38:46] that and say's a lifting standard of Liv
[38:48] living for your family and for you know
[38:50] the people around you and and driving
[38:53] positive change is broken and you stop
[38:55] putting the e in and this is this is
[38:58] exactly what
[39:00] socialism is like it just breaks that
[39:02] link it breaks that link completely you
[39:06] become
[39:08] um cattle for the state rather than you
[39:11] know it's it's pulling people down not
[39:13] lifting them up you know we've we' we've
[39:15] pretty much given up on the pursuit of
[39:18] excellence in the west especially UK and
[39:21] Europe you know we don't celebrate
[39:24] success we don't aim high we it's it's
[39:29] saying oh we need to we need to make
[39:31] everybody
[39:32] equal equality of outcome which is just
[39:36] just ludicrous quality of outcome is is
[39:40] where you get with with Communism if you
[39:42] remove people's purpose
[39:44] then you destroy everything everything
[39:47] then just corrodes so we've gone down
[39:50] down a slight political route here I
[39:51] guess Rob but it's not but it's yeah
[39:53] it's just shocking where we are do you
[39:56] think that Bitcoin kind of enforces a
[39:59] more capitalist uh uh State structure uh
[40:04] on onto us anyways like if is is the
[40:07] political Sol is Bitcoin also the
[40:09] political solution to our problem
[40:11] Bitcoin fixes everything Bitcoin fixes
[40:13] everything Robin because it's it's the
[40:15] peaceful opt out into a new system where
[40:19] much like on satosi side of the island
[40:21] you know the whole world is working 24/7
[40:24] to increase your purchasing power and
[40:25] the other side is your purchasing power
[40:26] is getting destroyed and is that such a
[40:29] no-brainer and and encourage people to
[40:31] watch the video because you when you
[40:32] watch the video it it it I would
[40:36] challenge you not to think oh my God
[40:38] that the choice is so Stark here the
[40:40] choice is so obvious for absolutely
[40:44] everybody they will make the they will
[40:46] make the leap at some point and we need
[40:48] to make the Gap as small as possible so
[40:50] they can make the smallest possible leap
[40:52] for the most the most number of people
[40:55] um but
[40:58] but yeah I mean capitalism
[41:00] is it shouldn't even be an ism
[41:03] capitalism is just being left alone is
[41:06] you know if if you and I can trade with
[41:08] each other at whatever price on whatever
[41:11] terms we
[41:13] want that's just the Natural State
[41:16] that's just the Natural
[41:17] State we don't need anybody giving us
[41:20] rules to be able to do that because
[41:22] that's just what naturally happens so
[41:24] capitalism isn't even an ism it's it's
[41:26] just the Natural State and it's when you
[41:28] start putting things in the way of
[41:30] capitalism that's when you have this you
[41:33] know an ideology of X or Y or Zed or
[41:35] whatever but it just fights human
[41:38] nature and so you know as people adopt
[41:42] Bitcoin they see their purchasing power
[41:45] increase they they tap into this network
[41:47] where everybody is acting in their own
[41:49] self-interest for the benefit of
[41:50] everybody else
[41:52] and it's an Unstoppable system and
[41:55] eventually it's just going to consume
[41:56] the world
[41:57] and at some point it begins to defund
[42:00] the
[42:01] governments right all the governments
[42:03] wake up which is the much more likely
[42:05] outcome in that somebody with a brain
[42:08] somewhere in the
[42:09] government wakes up and understands gets
[42:12] has the penny drop moment with Bitcoin
[42:15] in said actually instead of Bitcoin is
[42:17] not the problem Bitcoin is the
[42:20] solution it is the only solution for
[42:22] governments to bail themselves out from
[42:24] the the insolvency crisis that we
[42:26] already know we have we just haven't
[42:29] acknowledged it at a um you know at a
[42:32] governmental
[42:34] level um you know and when you have
[42:36] access to a money
[42:38] printer then the natural consequence of
[42:41] Game Theory here is you use the money
[42:42] printer to to print money to buy Bitcoin
[42:46] because it's the only way out it's the
[42:49] only way out and once one country starts
[42:50] doing it the floodgates will begin to
[42:53] open and those
[42:54] that those that don't engage are going
[42:57] to get left behind so it's Bitcoin is
[43:00] just a competitive Advantage for every
[43:03] person company State organization of any
[43:08] sort and it's going to it's going to
[43:10] suck everybody
[43:13] in we get to answer your question we get
[43:15] back to you know a much more much
[43:18] smaller governmental framework and much
[43:20] closer to you know pure capitalism which
[43:23] is the thing that has lifted the quality
[43:26] of living for
[43:28] uh so many people around the planet
[43:29] which is you know conveniently forgotten
[43:31] in in these more um socialist days I
[43:36] love that explanation i i l that a lot
[43:38] and how did you discover that in the
[43:41] first place how did you come to the
[43:42] conclusion that there is a problem and
[43:44] that Bitcoin is the right solution um
[43:48] but far too late
[43:51] is with the honest answer so in 2020 I
[43:54] started going down the rabbit hole
[43:57] and but it's just doing the work and
[43:59] consuming consuming the content reading
[44:02] the books listening to the podcast
[44:04] hearing the different
[44:05] perspectives and building it up from
[44:07] first principles which you can only do
[44:10] by by doing the work really like the
[44:12] principles of economics by safety and
[44:16] just fantastic should be a mandatory
[44:17] reading for for absolutely everybody in
[44:21] in schools in you know economics courses
[44:24] wherever because it's it's like it's
[44:26] almost undeniable
[44:28] like it's just so so logical the ostan
[44:30] framework is just so
[44:32] logical and it because it's driven from
[44:34] Human Action is not driven
[44:37] from you know handwavy Aggregates and
[44:41] you know relationships that are deemed
[44:44] you know uh scientific when in fact
[44:47] they're sort of more well they're not
[44:49] scientific should we let's just let's
[44:51] leave it let's leave it at that but I
[44:53] think
[44:54] the once you do the work and you you you
[44:57] build it you rip it down to First
[44:59] principles and you build it up again
[45:01] it's very clear to
[45:02] see it's very clear to see and that
[45:05] combined with the fact that I spent 10
[45:08] the first 10 years of my career in in
[45:10] investment Banks I know having been in
[45:12] those environments what the mentality is
[45:15] the the the investment banks are
[45:17] effectively attached one step away from
[45:19] the money printer by the way maybe I
[45:21] should have asked that earlier but what
[45:24] is actually your background what are you
[45:26] currently doing besides making bit
[45:28] convenience we we launched straight into
[45:30] it didn't we um so yeah I uh I did
[45:34] physics uh University and then I Jo
[45:38] became an AC durative Trader for 10
[45:40] years uh Goldman more s in UBS and then
[45:44] I moved into sports so started modeling
[45:47] um football from a soccer with Americans
[45:51] from a mathematical perspective and then
[45:53] realized like we do that pretty pretty
[45:55] well better than the but some of the
[45:57] bookmakers could do it at the time
[45:59] so left and created a qu engineering
[46:03] business with a partner who has a very
[46:05] similar background he was an engineer
[46:07] and then we wrote algorithms and
[46:09] realtime trading systems for supplying
[46:13] prices and new product to to bookmakers
[46:15] for the for the customers and then we
[46:17] were Acquired and we spent the last five
[46:19] six years growing the business that
[46:21] acquired us from a sort of national
[46:23] European Champion to a global player
[46:25] playing small part in that in various
[46:27] different guises and yeah but along the
[46:30] way found Bitcoin and so you know 12
[46:32] months ago well nine months ago was able
[46:35] to take a step out of that business and
[46:37] you know I remain a shareholder and you
[46:39] know that business is is going to do
[46:41] very well but it reached the point
[46:43] where it was so big my my ability to
[46:46] influence it in a way you know that that
[46:49] added sufficient value wasn't wasn't
[46:51] enough it wasn't the best use of my time
[46:53] should should I say like you know
[46:56] especially when you found Bitcoin
[46:57] because once you find Bitcoin is any
[47:00] time spent on anything else is is a
[47:02] waste and so that's where I found myself
[47:04] now is outside of family and maybe five
[47:07] or 10% of my time supporting people I
[47:10] want to see succeed if from an advisory
[47:13] perspective because I my last couple
[47:16] years the company that acquired us was
[47:18] running
[47:19] m&a um and the vent current in Venture
[47:23] fund that we started on balance sheet so
[47:24] in investing in small Sports the small
[47:27] startups the intersection Sports
[47:29] entertainment and technology which was
[47:32] great because that's where my passion is
[47:34] working small businesses solving
[47:35] problems helping Founders grow having
[47:38] been through that myself um and with my
[47:40] financial background and so now I
[47:43] contined to do that for a couple of
[47:46] small
[47:47] businesses one in the Bitcoin space one
[47:50] not in the Bitcoin space um just because
[47:53] I want to I like the people I want to
[47:55] help them succeed and and and grow but
[47:58] that's like 5% of my time maybe 10% of
[48:00] my time depending on depending on the
[48:02] week and the rest is just thinking about
[48:04] how to solve problems in Bitcoin and
[48:06] moving towards creating a Bitcoin
[48:08] business to solve the problems in
[48:10] Bitcoin I love that that's really cool
[48:13] that that they found that the clarity
[48:15] though the focus on on bitcoin is that
[48:18] also kind of uh the why why you made the
[48:22] video so professional like most people
[48:24] that do first video on something they
[48:26] think just recorder on like a webcam and
[48:28] but you made it a really professional
[48:31] video with it well I I was very
[48:33] fortunate to to find a local um
[48:37] videography company here who I think did
[48:39] a great job did did a great job with the
[48:42] video at Robert it just I would say it
[48:44] goes against my nature to
[48:46] be visible I would say so the thought of
[48:50] putting out a video and having it living
[48:52] on the internet
[48:53] was there was a certain level I had to
[48:56] get
[48:57] over which I had to not be embarrassed
[49:00] about the video and so I thought if I'm
[49:03] going to do this I
[49:04] should I have no skills in doing this
[49:06] myself I've never done anything like
[49:08] this so I'll find somebody who has and
[49:10] I'll I'll have them help me create a
[49:12] video of good enough quality that I'm
[49:14] not embarrassed about it and so that was
[49:17] sort of the first hurdle to get over but
[49:21] I think they did a really they did a
[49:22] really good job but I would say if I was
[49:24] doing it again I'd be much more
[49:26] efficient and which things would just be
[49:29] would be even better I mean like simple
[49:31] things I didn't have a
[49:34] script I I just sort
[49:37] of did the presentation a couple of
[49:39] times and refilmed it and then we
[49:41] stitched it together and so like you
[49:43] know listen looking back at the
[49:46] presentation now I'm like I should have
[49:49] I should have written a script
[49:50] beforehand and then you know I could
[49:51] have chosen my wording in this section
[49:53] or that section to be slightly better
[49:55] and so you know little things like this
[49:56] the things that you don't know about how
[49:59] to do things properly when you do it the
[50:01] first
[50:02] time yeah you you'll get better if if
[50:05] each time and uh once you once you do it
[50:08] like five six times you're like oh now
[50:10] now I kind of have to hang of it is kind
[50:14] of already my next question um will they
[50:17] come more are you planning on doing more
[50:20] uh explaining videos documentaries maybe
[50:22] even like other things like that major I
[50:26] I have no plans no plans to and this was
[50:31] as I said because it was an accidental
[50:32] creation and I because I thought it was
[50:34] good and the response was so good from
[50:36] people who were not
[50:37] bitcoiners who then wanted to learn
[50:39] about Bitcoin I thought okay well I you
[50:43] know this needs to be shared with other
[50:44] people so I'll put some time and effort
[50:46] into creating it and then sharing it um
[50:50] but the idea was not to commercialize it
[50:52] in any way it's free for everybody and
[50:55] I'll be making all the material we're
[50:57] building out getting out from under the
[50:59] flurry of emails from all around the
[51:01] world and you know over the next week or
[51:03] two hopefully we can open up all the
[51:05] materials slides the speaker notes the
[51:08] transcripts in English and then all the
[51:09] other languages and everybody can then
[51:13] take copies of this and go and do the
[51:14] presentation for their friends or take
[51:16] it and redesign it or create something
[51:18] new with the characters or or something
[51:20] like that I would love to see that sort
[51:21] of expansion of this but from a
[51:24] community perspective cuz it's not it's
[51:27] not a commercial not a commercial thing
[51:30] and I don't I don't see myself at the
[51:32] moment doing another video but I would
[51:34] love other people to you know if you
[51:36] want to create something that's got
[51:38] feell in it you know the big red button
[51:40] or something yeah great you know there's
[51:42] some I've had calls in the last few days
[51:44] with people who are creating new
[51:46] resources new
[51:48] materials that are sort of built on top
[51:51] of or connected to this you know whether
[51:53] it's visual stuff or it's like audio
[51:57] stuff like songs and things like it's
[51:58] just like crazy they you know we've got
[52:00] so many skills within the Bitcoin
[52:02] community and I just would love people
[52:04] to get involved and run with it in
[52:07] whatever Direction their skills take
[52:10] them and I'm certainly not planning to
[52:13] create a series of videos or something
[52:14] like all documentaries but if you want
[52:16] to have a chat about if anybody's
[52:18] listening you want to have a chat or
[52:20] they've got skills in making a cartoon
[52:22] or something like that I would love to
[52:24] love to have any in all conversations to
[52:26] get this into as many forms as possible
[52:28] so we can we can get everybody receiving
[52:30] this message across the world you're a
[52:32] true Bitcoin I I see that I love I love
[52:34] the Spirit uh that you have with sharing
[52:36] those things it's the same spirit I have
[52:39] with my podcast uh people sometimes ask
[52:41] me oh can I take the podcast or a clip
[52:43] of that and and share it with my
[52:45] audience I'm like yeah of course like
[52:47] take away like it's not my material it's
[52:50] bitcoin's material like Bitcoin owns
[52:52] that podcast um I'm I'm just happen to
[52:55] be a host of that and asking questions
[52:57] but this is uh is is I I feel like I'm
[53:02] employed by the Bitcoin Corporation and
[53:05] and uh that that it's owned by by
[53:07] Bitcoin this this content and this
[53:09] podcast obviously there's no cooporation
[53:12] above me it's it's it's legally just me
[53:15] um but that's how I look at it and every
[53:17] other bitcoiner who wants maybe sees a
[53:19] small clip uh and wants to share this in
[53:22] his audience they can just take it and
[53:24] share it if you want to use it
[53:26] commercially use it like I I don't have
[53:29] any like I don't claim any rights on on
[53:31] my podcast and I I just like to
[53:35] contribute something to to the Bitcoin
[53:37] community and I think that's the true
[53:39] Spirit of of Satoshi he he came into
[53:41] this world created bitcoin didn't take
[53:44] any credit didn't take any money and and
[53:46] went way like that's the true Spirit of
[53:49] Satoshi AB absolutely and you see it
[53:51] throughout the Bitcoin community and you
[53:54] know great great example here Rob is
[53:56] that since launching it we're now on 22
[53:58] 23 languages in translations they're all
[54:01] volunteers this is just bitcoiners
[54:03] around the world who have seen this and
[54:05] said can I please translate this into my
[54:09] local language and you know we've
[54:11] probably got another I'm sure we'll hit
[54:13] 30 languages in the next week or two
[54:17] weeks with all things in Flight just
[54:19] means we can get into more into more
[54:20] hands but everyone's doing this for free
[54:23] like I'm doing it for free it's costing
[54:25] me money to you know do the video and
[54:27] and you know have the website and the
[54:29] tools and all of these things but it's
[54:31] like it's the resource for for everybody
[54:33] and to everyone is Bitcoin is one of
[54:35] those things where the purpose of it is
[54:37] bigger than is bigger than you it I
[54:41] think Bitcoin brings out the best in
[54:43] people it's Everything feels the world
[54:46] just feels brighter and you're more
[54:49] optimistic once you once that penny has
[54:52] dropped with Bitcoin absolutely how did
[54:54] you look at like how was for you the
[54:57] reaction the response of the Bitcoin
[54:59] Community to your video was kind of like
[55:01] you're welcome to the community I mean
[55:03] this I smile says it all it's just been
[55:05] amazing it's Absol amazing like the
[55:08] number of DMS and comments and emails
[55:11] and yeah just just just fantastic just
[55:14] fantastic because it what's in the video
[55:16] is there's nothing new in the video like
[55:19] I don't think you would have watched the
[55:20] video and be like oh I didn't know that
[55:22] you know it it's what we all have in our
[55:25] heads it's we all carry in our heads but
[55:27] it's just delivered in a really
[55:31] accessible
[55:32] framework that
[55:35] saves that saves us having to figure out
[55:37] how to try and communicate with people
[55:39] who haven't even been tapped on the
[55:40] shoulder yet and I feel
[55:43] like you know I've had so many nice
[55:46] messages from people where it's been
[55:49] like this relationship unlock for them
[55:53] you know it's things like I've sent it
[55:55] to my Dad I've been trying to get him to
[55:58] learn about Bitcoin for three years and
[55:59] he's never bothered he saw this video
[56:01] and now he wants the Bitcoin standard
[56:03] you know that or you know I've shared
[56:05] this with my I watched this with my
[56:08] daughter and she's a teenager and now
[56:11] and then we had the best conversation
[56:12] we've ever had and she understands now
[56:16] why I'm so passionate about Bitcoin it's
[56:19] like you would be it's like a it's like
[56:21] a Miss just like a little missing piece
[56:22] in the
[56:23] jigsaw that helps Bridge the normal
[56:26] world to to where we are and it's not
[56:28] the last step by any means you know
[56:30] people will other people will create
[56:32] other content which makes it even easier
[56:33] but it's like you giving every Bitcoin a
[56:37] tool in their pocket that they can just
[56:40] you know the go-to resource when they
[56:42] have the opportunity to just very gently
[56:46] help someone get to the starting line
[56:47] you know they send this they watch the
[56:48] video and then they send them broken
[56:50] money by Lyn Alden or you talk by Alex
[56:53] gladstein or you know a Michael sailor
[56:55] video or you know any any of the other
[56:59] you know 10 or 15 people of books and
[57:02] resources that people tend to go to
[57:04] depending on you know what their
[57:05] preference is it just makes it it just
[57:08] makes on boarding so much so much easier
[57:10] and so yeah the biggest thing for me is
[57:13] like I I really like it that people have
[57:14] watched the video but the biggest thing
[57:16] is hearing that it's helped other people
[57:19] get to the starting line that's that's
[57:22] just amazing so the more people can see
[57:25] it the more people we can get to the
[57:26] starting line and Bitcoin bubble just
[57:28] grows even
[57:32] faster I love that um I have one
[57:35] question that I ask each and every one
[57:37] of my guests and the question is what
[57:39] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[57:41] what can you learn from me besides
[57:44] Bitcoin I don't know I when you say that
[57:48] the first thing that comes to my head is
[57:49] that Meme where you know you see all the
[57:51] words in someone's head and it's like
[57:53] Bitcoin and there's like a tiny space
[57:55] for anything else
[57:57] um what can we learn I I think I I guess
[58:01] this is more of a it's not it's not a
[58:03] thing it's more of a action in that
[58:08] Bitcoin there will be lots of people
[58:09] listening to this who are fully orange
[58:13] pilled but they're still living
[58:17] in Fiat world and they'll be thinking
[58:20] they'll have know in their
[58:22] minds that they are
[58:24] already fully
[58:26] Bitcoin but they in Fiat world still
[58:30] probably trapped in some way through
[58:33] financial constraints obligations
[58:36] running a business or something and I
[58:39] would encourage everybody to think about
[58:42] what the small things they can do every
[58:44] day are to help move us towards a world
[58:49] where everybody has
[58:51] Bitcoin because we all know that that
[58:54] that time is and you may not be able to
[58:56] leave your Fiat job you may not be able
[58:59] to dedicate a huge amount of time each
[59:01] day to doing something in Bitcoin but
[59:03] there's something you can do in the
[59:06] small actions that you have every day in
[59:09] the way that you carry yourself the
[59:11] conversations that you have to help
[59:14] further the ability of people to make
[59:17] that leap to
[59:18] bitcoin and you know it could be sharing
[59:21] the video could be other things it could
[59:23] just be every time you go into a shop to
[59:25] say can I pay B the answer you know the
[59:27] answer 99.9% of the time is going to be
[59:28] no but the fact that you asked and if we
[59:32] all ask then eventually the shopkeep
[59:35] going to be there's a lot of people
[59:36] asking to pay in Bitcoin maybe I should
[59:37] look into this thing it's is like those
[59:39] small actions every day even if you're
[59:41] trapped in fear and and beyond that I
[59:43] would also say this is a very long
[59:45] answer to your question Robin I hope you
[59:46] doing the the the other one is because
[59:49] Bitcoin is still so
[59:51] small like once you're in it you feel
[59:54] like surely everybody gets this but like
[59:56] Bitcoin is so small um in terms of the
[59:59] number of people actively
[60:01] involved in the little the little
[60:04] ecosystem but we have lots of sleeper
[60:06] agents around the world and this has
[60:08] been very clear to me over the last
[60:09] couple of weeks because I got emails
[60:10] from every corner of the world for
[60:12] people who are basically bitcoiners
[60:14] trapped in Fiat businesses or with no
[60:16] other bitcoiners that they know etc etc
[60:19] like they're everywhere they're
[60:20] everywhere but within if you think about
[60:23] the ven diagram of
[60:26] um people who understand
[60:29] Bitcoin understand Bitcoin as close to
[60:31] understanding Bitcoin as you as you are
[60:33] at your point in the
[60:34] journey and your skill set the overlap
[60:37] in those those two circles in the vend
[60:40] diagram is very very small very small so
[60:45] you may be a chemical engineer or you
[60:47] may be a Holier or you know you've got
[60:50] some some professional or educational
[60:54] background or knowledge of some area
[60:58] right and there's probably a lot of
[60:59] people in the world who do but there's
[61:02] very few people in the world who do but
[61:04] also get Bitcoin and so that makes you
[61:05] very
[61:06] special and if you if you think about
[61:10] where the world is
[61:11] going that world the world is going to
[61:14] bitcoin so you are incredibly well
[61:17] positioned to make a real
[61:20] difference in that intersection of the V
[61:23] diagram so start thinking about how
[61:27] giving your skill set your background
[61:31] how you think you your the future of
[61:34] that may evolve as Bitcoin eats the
[61:37] world think about the things that you
[61:38] can do to a accelerate that and be take
[61:44] advantage of that because by taking
[61:45] advantage of that you're helping Bitcoin
[61:49] grow into your sub sector your Sub Sub
[61:52] sub sector of knowledge or industry and
[61:55] we all get there
[61:57] faster and you have a competitive
[61:59] Advantage so so use it Bitcoin is the
[62:02] greatest free
[62:03] market that will ever exist and if we
[62:05] all act in our own self-interest it
[62:07] benefits everybody I and the L the
[62:09] message that those those small actions
[62:12] can actually make a huge difference in
[62:14] the long run and in in the bigger
[62:16] picture uh because people think like oh
[62:18] like if I just ask if I Cana Bitcoin
[62:20] what what will it change they just get
[62:22] annoyed but even if they get annoyed
[62:25] even if they act really which they
[62:28] probably won't um if they are nice
[62:31] people and most most people are nice I
[62:33] feel like
[62:35] um they they are aware of that that you
[62:38] wanted to pay with Bitcoin and if uh the
[62:40] next week uh on another day uh on
[62:44] another time another guest comes in and
[62:47] says the same
[62:48] thing uh and this happens over and over
[62:51] again at some point the waitress says
[62:54] hey uh boss there are people coming in
[62:57] and asking more and more about if they
[62:59] can pay Bitcoin and then maybe uh there
[63:02] are people out there selling like
[63:04] Lightning Point of Sales Point of Sales
[63:08] things maybe they already talked with
[63:10] with the uh restaurant owner and the
[63:13] restaurant owner like yeah like there
[63:14] was some guy here that that can do that
[63:17] and maybe the free full guests that came
[63:20] in and said like oh we want to pay with
[63:22] Bitcoin and the one guy that said like
[63:24] oh I I know how to to to get you on
[63:27] boarded is enough for the restaurant
[63:29] owner to call the guy back and like hey
[63:32] can you set up a Bitcoin payments here
[63:34] and that that's the Grassroots Movement
[63:36] we need like we need people to to work
[63:37] on all levels uh and and kind of try to
[63:42] to Orange build the world in that way
[63:43] and just a simple question of like oh
[63:45] can I also p in Bitcoin here or uh do
[63:48] you prefer C like it's like a small
[63:50] question like leave them an easy out
[63:53] like if you just bring Bitcoin in there
[63:55] and just was like yeah like I would like
[63:57] to pay with Bitcoin but also card is
[64:00] possible if Bitcoin is not an option
[64:01] here like you don't have to be an
[64:04] [ __ ] about it no no no no and and we
[64:06] absolutely shouldn't be right because
[64:08] bit Bitcoin is for
[64:10] anybody but but it's it absolutely does
[64:14] that you you have to be touched multiple
[64:17] times by Bitcoin for to really engage
[64:20] and you know it varies but it's a
[64:21] conversation starter as well Rob and
[64:25] Bitcoin has love talking about
[64:28] Bitcoin so you know every time where
[64:31] it's appropriate to talk about bitco
[64:32] inject Bitcoins the conversation do it
[64:35] because you never know the person on the
[64:37] other end might be might be a bitcoiner
[64:40] already right they might they might own
[64:42] a it or you might be interested to learn
[64:44] a bit more and you can send them in the
[64:46] right direction it's like these small
[64:47] these small actions every day the it was
[64:49] the local film crew orange orange P or
[64:52] did you do that I think we probably are
[64:55] now
[64:56] um yeah they they again most people have
[64:59] no
[65:00] clue we we're just we're so early we're
[65:03] so
[65:04] early absolutely really cool perfect and
[65:08] thank you Jo uh we have an endro in the
[65:09] podcast where uh the previous guest is
[65:11] asking a question for the next gu guest
[65:14] without knowing who the next guest
[65:15] actually is and uh yeah okay I should
[65:19] really I've watched the last podcast I
[65:21] have no idea what this uh yeah like the
[65:23] question is always anyway secret because
[65:25] like I I ask offline so uh you you you
[65:30] you have no way of knowing the question
[65:32] I don't I I I'm telling you uh the
[65:35] question is if you were the president of
[65:37] your country would you print money to
[65:40] buy Bitcoin in secret need to buy
[65:42] Bitcoin in secret that is a great that
[65:45] is a great
[65:46] question um I would say Ro it's not like
[65:50] we have have much transparency at the
[65:52] moment anyway right so it could well be
[65:56] happening I mean I'm I'm almost certain
[65:58] it's not because you know we're not
[66:00] switched on enough in the UK
[66:01] unfortunately but the um you don't get
[66:04] the transparency anyway right so it's
[66:06] not like you'd have to make a decision
[66:08] outside of the current framework to
[66:11] deliberately hide it from people right
[66:15] um and secondly it's the economically
[66:17] rational thing to do once you've
[66:21] um once you discover Bitcoin but I think
[66:24] importantly what it's what happens after
[66:26] which is the key
[66:27] thing because by by printing money
[66:30] you're effectively stealing from the
[66:32] population but in the same way that
[66:34] Michael sailor is is tapping into the FI
[66:37] the the financing glitch as soon as the
[66:40] government starts printing money to buy
[66:43] Bitcoin it strengthens the country
[66:46] because you're diluting your currency
[66:48] you're debasing the currency but you're
[66:50] putting an asset on the balance
[66:52] sheet which is the hard that's it that
[66:56] will ever exist and so you're making
[66:59] your country more prosperous by doing so
[67:01] so I think the question becomes what is
[67:04] the what do you then do what do you then
[67:06] do do you put it as a strategic
[67:09] reserve for the country and to make sure
[67:12] that you have a governance structure
[67:13] around that to make sure it then can't
[67:15] be abused or Wasted by the country but
[67:18] it's economically the rational thing to
[67:20] do because you don't move the market you
[67:22] don't tell the market and it's morally
[67:24] the right thing to do I gely
[67:26] because there's better use there's more
[67:28] value
[67:29] in the Fiat equivalent Bitcoin than
[67:32] there is in the Fiat but it's
[67:34] important you can only state that it's
[67:37] [Music]
[67:39] morally positive if you have the if you
[67:42] have a governance framework around it
[67:44] that the benefit then occures back to
[67:46] the population somehow so you know I've
[67:48] said before that
[67:50] the
[67:51] um the Strategic Bitcoin
[67:55] reserve for any
[67:57] country should be the Bitcoin that its
[68:00] population holds not what the government
[68:02] holds and the real way are that's the
[68:05] way it should be that's the way it
[68:06] should be because the government the way
[68:08] it's meant to work is the government
[68:09] draws its power from the population and
[68:12] so if your population owns Bitcoin then
[68:14] the power of that cres to the government
[68:17] through the
[68:19] population and
[68:21] so see yeah I think the argument would
[68:25] be
[68:26] print print currency print fiat currency
[68:29] to buy Bitcoin and then put that Bitcoin
[68:32] in the hands of everyone in the
[68:33] population not on the not on the balance
[68:36] sheet of Central Bank I love that answer
[68:39] that's really good thank you so much Joe
[68:41] um Before I Let You Go um we already
[68:44] showed the video where people can where
[68:46] can people uh see the video where where
[68:49] else can people find you and ask
[68:51] questions and reach out to you yeah well
[68:52] I'm I'm on exit satmo Joo and you can
[68:56] also find the video there's links on
[68:59] YouTube and uh onx to to take you to sat
[69:03] versus Fiat which is the home of where
[69:05] the video is there's extra resources um
[69:08] for follow on so once you watch the
[69:10] video if you're interested to learn more
[69:11] about Bitcoin there's a series of follow
[69:13] on videos created by some wonderful
[69:16] contributors of various types so there
[69:19] will be something there that that picks
[69:21] your interest as well as some books
[69:22] videos and books we'll probably add some
[69:24] podcasts as well in time and there's
[69:26] also the ability to get involved if
[69:28] you're a bitcoiner and if you want to
[69:31] support U maybe you've got translating
[69:34] skills or you'd like to go and get copy
[69:37] of the presentation to then give to your
[69:39] family and friends or your work
[69:40] colleagues wherever you are in the world
[69:42] or maybe you just want to be on a long
[69:43] list so if somebody calls up and says
[69:45] you know there's a company in Argentina
[69:47] that wants a presentation we can we've
[69:49] got people in Argentina that can go and
[69:50] give the presentation to the to the
[69:52] people in person so don't be shy of
[69:55] getting involved the ask is very low
[69:57] we'll add you to the list and we'll
[69:59] figure out how we're going to sort of
[70:00] mobilize the mobilize the volunteers
[70:02] into something which hopefully can get
[70:05] this message as across as many eyeballs
[70:08] as possible around the world um and yeah
[70:12] i' just love to I'd love to talk to
[70:13] people so get in touch and yeah Robin
[70:15] thanks ever for having me on uh they
[70:18] enjoyed really enjoyed the conversation
