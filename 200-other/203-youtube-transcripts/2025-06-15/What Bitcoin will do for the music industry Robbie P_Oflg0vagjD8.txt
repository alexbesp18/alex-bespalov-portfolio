[00:00] if you play my song today on Spotify or
[00:02] Instagram I won't get that money for 9
[00:04] months and if you think about how much
[00:06] the dollar devalues over night months
[00:08] like you're getting ripped off even more
[00:10] so I think it's over time people are
[00:12] going to start to see how broken that is
[00:14] and I think Bitcoin can fix it
[00:16] everything's very tribalistic your
[00:17] bitcoin's tribalistic and all the other
[00:19] altcoins everyone is in their tribes and
[00:22] then the question is is like well which
[00:24] tribe is the right tribe which tribe do
[00:25] you want to be part of you want to be
[00:27] the tribe that keeps getting wed and
[00:28] slaughtered or do you want to be part of
[00:30] the tribe that gets fabulously
[00:32] wealthy what is for you the most
[00:35] exciting aspect of Bitcoin in the lens
[00:38] of an artist as an content
[00:40] creator yeah that's a good question I I
[00:43] think it just comes into because at the
[00:45] moment with the way the music industry
[00:47] is and Spotify and and artists are
[00:49] getting paid such little amounts for
[00:50] their streams that over the last five
[00:53] six years there's been this conversation
[00:55] in web 3 you know outside of Bitcoin
[00:58] about how web free blockchains and all
[01:01] the [ __ ] coinery can improve in artists
[01:03] life and and I did some nfts four years
[01:06] ago but I noticed that even back
[01:09] then social platforms don't want people
[01:12] to leave the social platform they want
[01:13] you to stay there so if you're sending
[01:15] them to Spotify you get throttled in
[01:17] your reach if you're sending them to
[01:18] opencc maybe even more because it's all
[01:21] speculative stuff but what I've noticed
[01:23] in Bitcoin with things like wav Lake and
[01:26] I've played around with Noster a little
[01:28] bit but um
[01:30] the the zapping Satoshi over the
[01:33] lightning Network I mean that's been one
[01:35] of the best earners for me in the space
[01:38] outside of the Legacy music industry so
[01:41] I think for me when it comes to bitcoin
[01:44] obviously I'm I do Bitcoin themed music
[01:46] every so often I might comment on web 3
[01:50] and the other environments more kind of
[01:52] making fun of it but really like there's
[01:55] there's something here in in creating a
[01:57] hyper Niche Community because my music's
[02:00] able to go so much further if I'm out
[02:02] there competing with 70,000 other
[02:04] rappers rapping about the same thing
[02:07] it's it's hard to cut through the noise
[02:09] and and because I'm so passionate about
[02:12] Bitcoin like I've been rapping about
[02:13] finance and money for for well over 15
[02:16] years so this has been coming up in my
[02:19] content even before I knew about Bitcoin
[02:21] so Bitcoin is just a Natural Evolution
[02:23] for me for things to comment on in in my
[02:25] music and then not having to rely on
[02:29] receiving my royalties after 9 months of
[02:32] a stream like I can get zapped lightning
[02:34] Network Satoshi instantly on wav Lake um
[02:38] so yeah that that's that's probably the
[02:40] one of the major promises for what
[02:42] Bitcoin offers with micro payments and
[02:45] the layer twos and and where we're going
[02:47] from here on out is it 15 years you
[02:50] doing uh music when did you start uh
[02:53] like how old are you so I'm 38 so I
[02:57] started making music when I was 14 15
[03:00] roughly learned piano started writing
[03:02] songs so I've been doing this for more
[03:04] than two decades and I used to go by a
[03:07] different name zotek I've got a couple
[03:10] albums on Spotify under that even the
[03:12] the original Bitcoin slang song that I
[03:14] put out in 2019 was under that pseudonym
[03:17] um but you know through through life and
[03:19] evolution and and I've evolved so I've
[03:21] changed my name and kind of rebooted
[03:23] restarted up again but yeah I've been
[03:25] doing this for two decades now as a as a
[03:27] songwriter producer recording
[03:30] yeah really nice and then what got you
[03:33] focused on on bitcoin because you said
[03:36] you did other stuff other music uh
[03:39] before and now it's mostly Bitcoin
[03:41] themed and I also listen to uh the most
[03:44] toxic Bitcoin uh Bitcoin song and I have
[03:48] a lot of questions about that and we can
[03:50] get through that later but how why did
[03:53] you focus then on on bitcoin was this
[03:56] paired probably with your orange peeling
[03:58] story
[04:00] yeah focusing on bitcoin like I was
[04:03] saying earlier like I've been like these
[04:05] themes of so when I heard about Bitcoin
[04:07] I was already like very anti-authority I
[04:10] was I already understood that central
[04:12] banks were printing money to infinity
[04:14] and I was buying gold and silver and I
[04:15] was just expecting silver to go to $600
[04:18] an ounce and then when I heard about
[04:20] Bitcoin it just made all the sense to me
[04:22] there was no skepticism I understood it
[04:25] um the problem back then is I didn't
[04:26] have the finances to to really go in
[04:29] because I heard about Bitcoin when it
[04:30] was $2 a coin and so if we executed the
[04:34] plan that we wanted to do I'd be I'd
[04:36] have millions upon millions of dollars
[04:38] if I would have huddled but I didn't and
[04:40] that's cost me 1520 Million by not
[04:44] buying at $2 but over the years I
[04:46] started selling music uh for Bitcoin in
[04:48] 2013
[04:50] 2014 and I've always wanted to do songs
[04:53] about Bitcoin but it was hard to get
[04:56] started it's like this it was a little
[04:58] bit cringy you know it's like if you
[05:00] write a song about Pokemon or Dragon
[05:02] Ball Z it's not what people expect so it
[05:05] took me some time I I I I I played
[05:07] around with ideas and then when 2019
[05:10] came it just the idea hit me for Bitcoin
[05:13] slang and that song's really just a
[05:15] parody of a New York rapper from the 90s
[05:17] he had a song that was focusing on
[05:20] street slang and I just flipped it into
[05:22] Bitcoin slang and that became my most
[05:24] successful song to that date and to even
[05:27] to to right now it's still my most
[05:28] successful song with the amount of views
[05:30] and the attention it's gotten and the
[05:32] opportunities I've gotten from that so
[05:34] since then I've realized that I have two
[05:38] options I can keep doing my standard hip
[05:41] hop broad genre music talking about life
[05:45] and whatever and I find that like I was
[05:47] talking earlier on about like cutting
[05:49] through the noise there's so many
[05:50] musicians doing that and then because
[05:52] I'm so Savvy with Bitcoin and I
[05:54] understand it in and out like because
[05:57] I'm a I'm a bit of a hobbyist developer
[05:59] as well so I like to develop and play
[06:01] around with
[06:03] code so so yeah like I mean from the
[06:06] coding perspective the economic
[06:08] perspective of Bitcoin and everything
[06:10] else and then when you're a musician you
[06:12] you kind of see patterns music is all
[06:15] patterns chord progressions and and the
[06:17] and the drum patterns so you start to
[06:20] see patterns in in E economics you know
[06:22] and the charts and and what I've noticed
[06:25] with biton is yeah my option is either
[06:28] keep doing that other style of music
[06:29] music or kind of go more bullish with
[06:32] the Bitcoin music and I've been doing
[06:34] half half right over the last few years
[06:37] I've only really done maybe one two
[06:39] three Bitcoin songs a year and then
[06:41] maybe 20 30 songs and the other stuff so
[06:45] I'm I'm I guess I have to I have to pick
[06:48] my moments when I when I go hard with
[06:50] Bitcoin this year is going to be a heavy
[06:52] year for me with um Bitcoin music and
[06:54] Bitcoin content um and I mean that's
[06:58] where I get the most success that's
[07:00] where I'm appreciated the most um and
[07:02] there's a quote out there that you know
[07:04] you go where you're appreciated if
[07:06] you're if you're in Australia and you're
[07:08] just doing standard music about Street
[07:10] culture well I'm not appreciated in that
[07:14] environment as much as I am in the
[07:16] Bitcoin ecosystem and so I'm sort of
[07:19] gravitating towards that now and that's
[07:21] what's happening with this Bitcoin
[07:22] conference and everything else where
[07:24] those doors are really opening up for me
[07:26] so it just makes sense to keep moving
[07:28] forward with that
[07:30] yeah I think uh we we did not mention it
[07:32] till now you are in what is it two weeks
[07:35] or something like that on 22nd of March
[07:37] at the Bitcoin live uh do you do like a
[07:40] a song there do you perform your
[07:43] speaking there what's your what's your
[07:44] thing on the Bitcoin live conference
[07:47] yeah so the conference is on the 23rd of
[07:50] March uh I heard about it now some of
[07:52] the people that I've known and I've
[07:54] gotten to know through through Twitter
[07:57] in the Bitcoin um ecosystem like tips
[07:59] and Zed she's performing um at the
[08:02] Bitcoin a live conference she was in
[08:04] Singapore she was in Portugal so she's
[08:05] been doing the rounds so so I see her as
[08:08] a bit of an inspiration and I just
[08:09] reached out to her and asked her if she
[08:11] could connect me with the organizers of
[08:13] the Bitcoin Al life conference we had a
[08:15] chat and it's panned out that over a 15
[08:18] minute window I'll be doing a number of
[08:20] my Bitcoin songs toxic Bitcoin Maxi
[08:22] Bitcoin slang alltime High lessons of
[08:24] regrets a few unreleased songs as well
[08:27] so this is going to be exciting
[08:30] is really really cool yeah um I'm
[08:32] looking forward to that unfortunately
[08:33] I'm not in Australia it's a it's a long
[08:36] ride for me but I want to be in an
[08:38] Australian Bitcoin conference at at some
[08:40] point um you also mentioned that you are
[08:42] a hobby developer did you try to
[08:45] contribute to bitcoin core did you mess
[08:48] around with lightning what did you do
[08:50] with with with developing with Bitcoin
[08:52] or is just uh from developing you know
[08:55] Bitcoin
[08:57] better if we go back to to Myspace you
[09:00] familiar with back when Myspace was the
[09:02] thing the the audio platform social
[09:04] media platform well do you remember that
[09:07] or I I I'm actually I think I'm too
[09:11] young for that I'm 25 and I my first
[09:14] social media was Facebook so Facebook
[09:17] was my thing and I know everybody's like
[09:19] oh this is my MySpace Myspace but I
[09:22] actually never other than in some movies
[09:25] and series I never saw Myspace I never
[09:27] visited the website so I I did not
[09:29] really get to know Myspace yeah well so
[09:32] back in the day this is like think in
[09:35] 2007 2006 2005 you could upload music to
[09:39] Myspace it was like a social platform
[09:41] like Facebook but the cool thing you
[09:42] could do is you could code up how your
[09:44] page looked you could change the
[09:45] background images so I started messing
[09:47] around with HTML CSS then I got into
[09:50] building WordPress websites and
[09:52] understanding a bit of PHP I've studied
[09:55] python over the last few years because I
[09:56] really want to improve my python um
[09:59] understanding
[09:59] I haven't contributed anything to
[10:02] bitcoin core from a development side and
[10:04] that really was 10 years ago when I was
[10:06] thinking what how can I contribute to
[10:08] bitcoin well it turned out that doing
[10:10] art and music and commentating on on the
[10:13] space and I guess almost help marketing
[10:15] it is probably my contribution as far as
[10:18] that goes because I'm not I I I don't
[10:20] trust my development skills to be able
[10:22] to write very dense code um but I'm I'm
[10:25] very good at reverse engineering things
[10:27] and doing little things for websites and
[10:29] whatnot you know and I think it's also
[10:32] important that whatever you do you do a
[10:34] lot of a lot other stuff too like you uh
[10:38] um if if if you're just doing music you
[10:41] have to get your inspiration from
[10:43] somewhere uh and I notice it with my um
[10:46] content with the interviews and also
[10:49] with with the Twitter uh tweets and
[10:51] posts that I get out and I'm also trying
[10:53] to get more long Fromm articles out and
[10:56] I'm also working on on on books uh now
[10:59] it will come maybe next year uh so it's
[11:03] I discovered that it's really important
[11:05] to get some inspiration and to get
[11:09] inspiration uh you need to get out of
[11:11] your uh focused thing it's important to
[11:14] be focused and and and work on something
[11:17] but it's also important to do completely
[11:19] something else that you never did before
[11:21] uh like just going out and doing
[11:24] something uh and then all of a sudden
[11:26] like an idea strikes you H where do you
[11:28] like how do you go go ahead and get
[11:31] inspiration for song ideas for lines for
[11:35] how to craft songs like how is this this
[11:38] process working for you yeah there's
[11:41] there's a lot of different ways to
[11:42] approach it and and I guess getting
[11:45] inspiration I kind of consider it like a
[11:47] sponge you have to live life you have to
[11:49] experience life and do things that are
[11:50] out of your comfort zone and just absorb
[11:53] those experiences and I guess like when
[11:55] you're cooking marinate it for a little
[11:57] bit and then later on
[12:00] uh I'm not sure how it happens but you
[12:02] get on a tangent you get on this um
[12:05] something inspires you maybe I hear a
[12:06] sound of a different song and I I want
[12:08] to emulate that and along the ways
[12:11] everything just falls into place I mean
[12:13] when you've been writing songs for as
[12:15] long as I have it's it's like a well
[12:18] trained muscle um but for the most part
[12:21] when it comes to like the lyrics and the
[12:23] idea of the ideas when it comes to like
[12:27] punch lines because in hip-hop if you go
[12:29] back throughout the history of hip poop
[12:31] it was very punchline orientated you
[12:32] have a setup and a punch almost like
[12:34] comedy and one of the things I like to
[12:37] bring to music still in this day and era
[12:40] is this punchline aesthetic this um
[12:42] almost battle rap kind of flare to to to
[12:45] my Bitcoin songs uh and that kind of
[12:48] takes more work you know to to to choose
[12:51] the right words you don't always want to
[12:53] use the same rhyme schemes and the same
[12:55] words um but I couldn't break it down
[12:58] right now of the process it's just more
[13:01] like absorb things and then when time's
[13:04] right the time's right it just pours out
[13:06] of you you know that's amazing I think
[13:10] um I write 12 tweets a day still like
[13:15] I'm writing so many tweets and of course
[13:18] there are so many repetitions in there
[13:20] like there are things that I maybe
[13:22] already said in some other way because
[13:24] 12 tws a day if you do it for one and a
[13:27] half years now there will be things that
[13:29] just do it over and over and and repeat
[13:33] itself um but uh in writing tweets I got
[13:37] really really good just with training it
[13:39] just with doing it over and over and
[13:41] over again and sometimes I'm like oh
[13:44] [ __ ] I did not write a tweet I have to
[13:46] get something and sometimes I'm just
[13:48] taking something that is already
[13:49] existing and get my comments on top of
[13:52] that and all of the that this one tweet
[13:54] gets like
[13:55] 300K um Impressions and it's not that
[13:59] it's got It's not luck it's not like oh
[14:02] it's it's it's it's something the
[14:04] algorithm picked up it's just that I got
[14:07] really good in how uh I have to write it
[14:11] what do I have to put in front what do I
[14:13] have to put in the middle like um to get
[14:16] like um some something going and I think
[14:19] also with you the repetition and you're
[14:21] doing it for a long long time now almost
[14:23] two decades and you just get really good
[14:26] in doing it with the repetition and
[14:28] that's also kind of was what I will do
[14:30] now with the podcast because I had no no
[14:32] idea how to do a podcast I had no idea
[14:35] how to interview people but I just
[14:37] started out yeah not even three months
[14:39] ago and now I have my 66th uh guest here
[14:43] and I'm trying to get better and I can
[14:47] only imagine how my Pro progress will be
[14:50] when I have the 1,000 guest the 2000
[14:52] guest on uh and I will definitely go
[14:56] there and it's interesting to see how
[14:57] you get better with just doing it over
[15:00] and over again and abut coming coming
[15:04] back coming back to can I just say
[15:06] something when I found when I found your
[15:08] Twitter your tweets were recommended to
[15:10] me I wasn't following you at the start
[15:12] and then something you posted I liked it
[15:14] just recommended to me I started
[15:16] following you and then engaging with
[15:18] some of your comments and I think this
[15:19] is how we ended up here but I think
[15:21] you've done well with that the and
[15:22] that's and you're absolutely right like
[15:24] you have to repeat and repeat repeat and
[15:26] get better at the structure of what
[15:28] you're writing and the same when it
[15:29] comes to writing a verse and yeah you
[15:31] got to keep that muscle
[15:34] exercised yeah it's it's it's it's
[15:36] fascinating how Twitter is really
[15:39] growing good like it's it's it's organic
[15:41] growth you just put out stuff and
[15:42] they're recommending to people that they
[15:45] know might be interesting in and you
[15:47] just uh you just find your audience you
[15:50] find the people that like that stuff and
[15:53] you're right actually this this is like
[15:55] uh never talked about that on the
[15:56] podcast this is how my process on
[15:59] finding guest is like I go through all
[16:01] my replies I watch everything that's
[16:03] going on under my post and when someone
[16:07] is replying that I think is interesting
[16:10] I'm like hey do you want to be on my
[16:12] podcast and this is how I got I think
[16:16] 95% of my guest till now so there's no
[16:20] process I'm not like oh I could do this
[16:23] because this is an interesting theme I'm
[16:25] like oh he sounds interesting let's do
[16:27] it with him that's really really simp
[16:30] simp yeah and I honestly I had no idea
[16:32] that commenting on your tweets i' I'd be
[16:34] in this position today talking to you so
[16:36] that's just crazy the twist of fate
[16:39] definitely definitely and I listened and
[16:43] I liked because I'm consider myself a
[16:45] Bitcoin Maxi I don't consider myself a
[16:47] toxic Bitcoin Maxi but some maybe I'm
[16:50] I'm sometimes a little toxic especially
[16:52] on
[16:55] Twitter and and I heard about your
[16:57] Bitcoin songs listen to them and I think
[17:00] if you write Bitcoin songs you have to
[17:03] study uh Bitcoin culture and bitcoiners
[17:06] to being able to write those songs how
[17:10] would you describe the Bitcoin culture
[17:12] the Bitcoin Maxi culture the normal
[17:14] Bitcoin culture what do you see there
[17:17] happening how would you describe like if
[17:19] if some alien comes down on on Earth and
[17:22] and you have to describe him Bitcoin
[17:24] culture and the Bitcoin Community how
[17:26] would you how would you go ahead and do
[17:28] that
[17:30] and Bitcoin culture in the community I
[17:32] think I think it's the way I would
[17:35] describe it is everything's very
[17:36] tribalistic you know bitcoin's
[17:38] tribalistic and all the other altcoins
[17:40] everyone is in their tribes and then the
[17:43] question is is like well which tribe is
[17:45] the right tribe which tribe do you want
[17:46] to be part of you want to be the tribe
[17:48] that keeps getting wrecked and
[17:49] slaughtered or do you want to be part of
[17:50] the tribe that like British hudle would
[17:53] say gets fabulously wealthy you know and
[17:55] especially if you want to be on the
[17:57] right side of History over the last you
[17:59] know the the the pandemic and everything
[18:01] that's happened in the last say three
[18:02] four five years we've seen a lot of
[18:05] things take place and things evolve and
[18:08] we've and things have come to light
[18:10] about the world for a lot of normies out
[18:12] there for example you know so I think
[18:15] Bitcoin is uh they understand the way
[18:18] the world works and every time you study
[18:20] Bitcoin you go deeper into it it it
[18:22] unveils the layer the next layer of what
[18:24] how the world runs um I think I said
[18:27] this in my in my first ever podcast is
[18:29] Bitcoin has taught me more about the
[18:32] world than school could have taught me
[18:34] or anything else I mean obviously I was
[18:37] already understanding how central banks
[18:39] work and what not with when I was buying
[18:42] gold and silver before Bitcoin but
[18:44] getting into Bitcoin it's it's a tribe
[18:47] we all understand how the world operates
[18:50] better than most and then you know
[18:52] people say we got 8 IQ because we think
[18:55] it's going up forever but then maybe I'm
[18:58] TR off here on that point but the I
[19:00] think it's it's like it's almost like a
[19:03] religion also you know like which
[19:07] religion is the right one which coin is
[19:08] the right one you know this is this all
[19:10] comes back into the provence of the
[19:12] tribe you know if you want to trace back
[19:14] which whether it's Catholicism
[19:16] Christianity or any denomination of
[19:18] Christianity or even Orthodox like which
[19:20] one's the right one well you can go back
[19:22] and study the Bible look at all the
[19:24] people that followed Jesus the disciples
[19:26] all the writings and you can get the
[19:28] Providence and that's kind of like the
[19:29] longest chain theory in Bitcoin you know
[19:31] going back to the Providence so if an
[19:33] alien came to Earth I'd probably just
[19:35] point those things out to them because
[19:37] they would probably understand Jesus
[19:38] Christ they would understand tribes and
[19:41] take it from there I guess yeah ifan
[19:45] comes to our Earth to probably have
[19:47] Bitcoin or something like that I guess
[19:52] there also wild Theory there are also
[19:54] wild theories that um aliens brought
[19:56] Bitcoin to Earth
[19:59] uh which I I like to always speculate um
[20:03] do you have a speculation on how Bitcoin
[20:05] came to be like what SOS Nakamoto is
[20:08] like how this this came together was it
[20:10] just some nerd in a basement that was
[20:13] dying from something or was it like the
[20:15] CIA also heard about that well I've seen
[20:19] a lot of stuff you know that there's
[20:20] that guy Da Vinci who was in early he
[20:23] was he was part of biton early in the
[20:25] days um and he he made a reference to
[20:28] how if someone in the NSA crafted
[20:30] Bitcoin they would have used a
[20:32] randomizer for the generation of um I
[20:34] think it's the public addresses and
[20:36] something in that I don't fully
[20:38] understand that part but it's a
[20:40] randomizer that the NSA did not create
[20:43] and then when I was looking at how many
[20:44] coins are M are Meed every day because
[20:47] for example Nicola Tesla says the
[20:49] secrets to the universe are in the
[20:51] numbers
[20:51] 369 so then if you look at the Block
[20:55] every time Bitcoin halves 210,000 block
[20:59] and then onwards and onwards it's a 3636
[21:01] pattern and then the total amount of
[21:03] Bitcoin being mined at when it was 50
[21:06] Bitcoin a 10-minute block that was 7,200
[21:09] coins two and seven two and seven is
[21:11] nine now it's 900 coins a day when it
[21:14] halves it's 450 coins a day four and
[21:16] five is nine so when I started seeing
[21:18] this 369 pattern in Bitcoin that made me
[21:22] start thinking there's probably more to
[21:24] this than some coder in the background
[21:27] it could be a coincidence
[21:29] because Bitcoin runs on time 24 hours 10
[21:32] minutes a block you know and and that so
[21:35] 369 is also in our day in day out
[21:39] calendar but I just found that really
[21:41] interesting but looking at the Satoshi
[21:43] emails that have been coming out you
[21:45] know Satoshi never really had a cap on
[21:48] bitcoin someone else suggested that to
[21:49] him through the I think it was the
[21:51] Bitcoin Blog Talk form so seeing
[21:54] individuals come and contribute to
[21:56] bitcoin even from the mailing lists I
[21:59] find it interesting I think it would
[22:01] have been an individual and everyone
[22:04] else that was on the internet
[22:06] communicating and maybe you had some
[22:07] people that maybe understood the 369
[22:10] that contributed something indirectly
[22:13] for it to turn out how it is because I
[22:15] don't see the 369 pattern in many other
[22:17] coins I've only had a look at two but I
[22:20] don't really see any any other cryptos
[22:22] or bit or anything outside of Bitcoin
[22:25] that has this 369 Nicola Tesla idea
[22:27] embedded into into it and not a lot of
[22:29] people are talking about this either but
[22:31] I found some tweets which were
[22:33] interesting yeah it's an interesting
[22:35] development how Bitcoin came to be and
[22:37] there are so many theories there like
[22:39] even books about the the discovery of of
[22:42] Bitcoin and the book is only about the
[22:45] different theories and they analyzing uh
[22:48] not not only the content of the emails
[22:51] also how he wrote and they discovered
[22:54] that he wrote in different styles like
[22:57] the emails were not always completely
[23:00] the same this can be normal but it can
[23:02] also be an indicator that the account
[23:05] was used by more than one person uh
[23:07] there's so many theories going on and I
[23:10] had like some like a a month or
[23:12] something like that in 2021 where I
[23:14] researched really deeply and my
[23:16] conclusion was like there is no
[23:18] conclusion it's
[23:20] like you can dive really deep into that
[23:24] but in the end of the day it's it's it's
[23:25] a mystery and it's I think it's a good
[23:27] mystery to to have in Bitcoin uh and to
[23:30] have this this thing it's like I think
[23:32] there was also one question coming up
[23:34] today on on my YouTube uh comments
[23:37] saying oh what will happen if if uh s
[23:40] Nakamoto dumps all one million Bitcoin
[23:43] uh on the market first of all I don't
[23:45] think he he will because I think how he
[23:48] set it up uh he he tumped his private
[23:51] keys I think they they will not move
[23:54] from him uh but even if it does it's
[23:56] just short-term chaotic uh stuff and
[24:00] long-term good opportunity and even like
[24:03] maybe it makes Bitcoin even stronger
[24:05] because it's like an attack from the
[24:08] founder which is the the most attack
[24:11] yeah that's interesting that's
[24:13] interesting yeah I think it is it all
[24:15] comes down to speculation on who Satoshi
[24:17] was whether it was a group organization
[24:19] or an individual yeah I I lean to more
[24:22] towards an individual because yeah like
[24:25] I mean I've looked at the same
[24:26] researches as you have I've gone down
[24:28] some holes but it's an interesting I
[24:29] think we can speculate all we want but I
[24:31] think the important thing is is the fact
[24:34] that we don't know who the founder is is
[24:36] a good thing you know with all the other
[24:40] cryptocurrencies if the founder goes
[24:42] missing then that would really bring a
[24:44] lot of uh fear and panic and fud to
[24:46] those coins you know if that person dies
[24:49] they stop developing or they they decide
[24:51] to move on to a different project so I
[24:54] think it's a good thing that's Satoshi
[24:55] stayed Anonymous I'm super excited to
[24:58] announce that this podcast got the first
[25:01] ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[25:05] from day one and did teach and preach
[25:08] self custody this is my goto exchange
[25:12] when someone asks me oh where can I buy
[25:14] my Bitcoin from this is the easiest
[25:16] entry for bitcoiners and if you want
[25:19] lower fees Plus at the same time support
[25:22] this podcast use code Robin and click
[25:25] the link in the description yeah and
[25:27] it's amazing that uh the project still
[25:29] lives on uh and will live on forever I
[25:33] guess because when you have most
[25:35] companies starting obviously Bitcoin is
[25:38] not a company but if you have if you
[25:40] have this comparison with a company and
[25:43] they are starting a company and the
[25:44] founder just leaves after a few months
[25:46] or a year the company probably dies like
[25:49] the company has to be really good in the
[25:50] first year and the culture has to be
[25:53] really embedded in everyone so that the
[25:56] company lives on but this proves a
[25:58] Bitcoin is just an idea whose time has
[26:00] come and was so powerful for other
[26:03] people to continue that uh so it's
[26:06] fascinating story and then this also
[26:08] takes us to a long uh time Horizon where
[26:12] we uh and you mentioned that in in in in
[26:14] your songs the Bitcoin Citadel where we
[26:17] going and then and uh like I there's a
[26:21] Bitcoin Citadel in Austria where it's
[26:23] like a conference and it's also like
[26:25] sometimes in the Swiss some Germany some
[26:26] sometimes Austria and I was once there
[26:28] and it was really nice being on a like a
[26:31] out Farm where nobody is there's no
[26:34] civilization there just 200 bitcoiners
[26:36] celebrating
[26:37] it Bitcoin uh um and I'm I'm curious
[26:42] like is is is do you think do we have to
[26:45] flee at some point to a Bitcoin Citadel
[26:47] in the in the world because the world
[26:49] goes in Madness or will the whole world
[26:53] become the Bitcoin cadel based on a
[26:56] sound money sound money standard what do
[26:58] you you think about the future of
[27:00] Bitcoin yeah maybe far far into the
[27:03] future you know we the whole world could
[27:05] be the Citadel but I know that BTC
[27:08] sessions talked about this as well about
[27:10] how I mean in this in this community
[27:13] that we're all in we all have similar
[27:14] values we all see this the world the
[27:16] same way we know that things are broken
[27:18] and things can be fixed with Bitcoin and
[27:20] it goes even further to just morals and
[27:22] values so I think the Citadel is
[27:24] decentralized you know like if someone
[27:26] in Melbourne cuz I'm in Melbourne
[27:27] Australia if I know another Bitcoin here
[27:29] in Melbourne then we can have each
[27:32] other's bucks and then at the same time
[27:34] now I know you I can have your back you
[27:36] can have my back if anything ever
[27:37] happens in the world where we need to
[27:39] back each other if your bank account
[27:41] gets cut off you got a Bitcoin address
[27:43] and bitcoiners around the world could
[27:45] support you if anything ever happens you
[27:47] know I think that's where the community
[27:49] is at at the moment where the Citadel is
[27:51] technically decentralized like Bitcoin
[27:53] but in the future I think there may be a
[27:55] country like El Salvador or somewhere
[27:57] else where
[27:59] there will be a strong Citadel presence
[28:01] where it'll be like you know Bitcoin is
[28:04] living it up in something that's may be
[28:05] like a gated community which would kind
[28:07] of be scary really if you think of if
[28:09] the world's going that way but yeah I
[28:12] think at the moment it's it's
[28:14] decentralized on the topic of
[28:15] decentralization it's interesting for me
[28:17] because uh like Bitcoin decentralized
[28:20] but then there's also something on uh
[28:23] something else going on right now with
[28:25] content creators with artists that
[28:26] they're also getting kind of
[28:28] decentralized like if you if you had
[28:30] like a podcast show like that in for in
[28:33] in like 30 50 years ago you would have
[28:36] gone to like a TV channel and you have
[28:39] to uh have to get up the letter or know
[28:43] someone or kiss some ass or whatever to
[28:45] to get into the position to host
[28:48] something some show like that now you
[28:51] can just go on YouTube you can just go
[28:52] on Spotify wherever you want to go and
[28:55] you can just host the podcast everybody
[28:58] can can be a podcast host it's just like
[29:01] putting something out there and if
[29:03] you're good then people find you and
[29:05] people listen to you if not then not uh
[29:08] and it's decentralizing the whole thing
[29:10] also with artist people can like put out
[29:12] on Tik Tok and YouTube and Spotify and
[29:15] everything uh just the music for people
[29:17] to enjoy and people can listen to it and
[29:20] that don't it does not has to be a label
[29:23] it doesn't has to be something in
[29:24] between behind how do you see um the the
[29:28] decentralization status of of the artist
[29:30] world because I'm really deep in podcast
[29:32] and the social media world but I don't
[29:34] have the Insight in the artist side of
[29:38] things how how far are we how how
[29:41] powerful are labels still and how do you
[29:44] go ahead and publish stuff and do did
[29:46] you ever fought or had context with like
[29:48] some bigger
[29:50] labels I've never had contact with big
[29:52] labels I have been signed to a label in
[29:55] the past and I've even started my own uh
[29:57] record label like back in 2010 um with a
[30:00] friend of mine and you know we created a
[30:02] bit of a a community of of of battle
[30:05] Showmanship like battle rappers and
[30:07] putting shows on but from what I see
[30:09] it's like central banks are just the
[30:12] same as major record labels they're
[30:14] clutching at straws trying to survive
[30:15] and doing whatever they can Universal
[30:18] Music Group took down all the music from
[30:20] from Tik Tok because Tik Tok wasn't
[30:22] paying enough in licensing fees so that
[30:24] kind of opens up the door for
[30:25] Independent Artists to fill the gap and
[30:28] I think these big centralized
[30:31] organizations are trying to make power
[30:33] moves to control things but this is just
[30:37] yeah like I said clutching at straws
[30:38] because they're losing control bit by
[30:40] bit and for myself if I release a song I
[30:43] have my own distribution account with a
[30:45] distribut distributor um there's no
[30:47] contracts other than I grant them the
[30:49] rights to distribute my music they
[30:51] collect royalties on behalf of me I'm
[30:53] registered with performing rights
[30:55] organizations who also can collect
[30:56] royalties for me from over radio or if
[30:59] my stuff's played on social media um on
[31:02] on Digital radio overseas so I've got
[31:05] all that stuff sorted out so I don't
[31:07] need a label to handle that and then
[31:09] take 30% you know so the I think it's
[31:13] nothing but up upside for artists the
[31:15] hardest thing is is that it's Mak it's
[31:17] lowering the entry the barrier to entry
[31:19] for artists so there's there's more
[31:21] worse music coming out there's more
[31:23] noise to cut through and that's when
[31:26] when I think of my position here and
[31:28] Bitcoin as a musician and and I guess
[31:31] being part of this hyper community
[31:33] community as I would say it's because
[31:36] the noise is so crazy out there that we
[31:38] have to now basically dial in into hyp
[31:40] nich communities I think genres are dead
[31:43] you've got you've got uh singer
[31:45] songwriters in Bitcoin you got EDM um
[31:47] producers in Bitcoin that make Bitcoin
[31:49] music and so it's not so much about the
[31:52] genre of music now it's more the message
[31:54] of the music and so for me the message
[31:57] when I make Bitcoin music it's about
[31:59] Freedom it's about sovereignty um and
[32:02] that's kind of how I see it and we don't
[32:05] really need record labels anymore we
[32:06] kind of just have to learn how the
[32:09] structure of what they created because
[32:11] the the the the copyrights to music and
[32:13] how all that works is so complex that
[32:16] sometimes I get confused with things you
[32:18] know and I've been doing this for two
[32:19] decades so new musicians coming in
[32:22] they're going to struggle even more to
[32:24] understand it uh but over time they will
[32:26] understand it and over time will
[32:28] understand more how uh intellectual
[32:30] property works and how we license that
[32:33] and
[32:34] how Instagram Facebook Tik Tok YouTube
[32:37] utilize our music and how we get paid
[32:39] from that I think over time it's going
[32:41] to shift even more it's interesting
[32:43] because I have no clue how this all
[32:45] works to be honest um you said something
[32:49] about uh you have uh registered with
[32:52] someone that collects loyalties on when
[32:55] you are on social media and when people
[32:57] play your song how does this work like
[33:00] you give them the song and when someone
[33:03] is playing your song on Tik Tok do you
[33:06] get something from that like
[33:08] unfortunately I have like zero clue
[33:10] about that maybe you can film him a
[33:12] little bit so so so for example in 2018
[33:16] when just before Tik Tok came around I
[33:18] think Facebook and Instagram and these
[33:20] social media platforms had to make deals
[33:23] with performing rights organizations and
[33:25] a performing rights organization they
[33:27] usually represent a region so like in
[33:29] Australia you have AA amcos which
[33:31] represent Australia and New Zealand
[33:33] artists um so then Facebook would pay a
[33:36] license fee to Appa and amcos and then
[33:39] they would keep track of the of the
[33:42] plays of like my song being added to
[33:44] someone's story or being used in a real
[33:47] they let APPA and amcos know and out of
[33:49] the pool of money that they get given
[33:50] from Facebook meta YouTube and everyone
[33:53] then I get my little slice of the pie
[33:55] and I think this is why maor label
[33:57] started signing Tik Tok artists because
[33:59] they were able to exploit that pool of
[34:02] money for their benefit by signing an
[34:05] independent artist who just had a song
[34:06] blow up so yeah the Performing rights
[34:08] organizations collect money from whoever
[34:10] is broadcasting music even radio
[34:13] stations even when you walk into a
[34:15] cafeteria usually by law they need to
[34:17] pay a license fee to be able to play
[34:19] music uh and then when when everything
[34:21] said and done the artists get their
[34:23] money reports are passed on to whoever
[34:25] it's passed on to and this is is how we
[34:28] collect the royalties and the situation
[34:29] is it takes N9 months to collect a
[34:31] royalty if you play my song today on
[34:33] Spotify or Instagram I won't get that
[34:36] money for nine months and if you think
[34:38] about how much the the the dollar
[34:40] devalues over nine months like you're
[34:42] getting ripped off even more so I think
[34:44] it's over time people are going to start
[34:46] to see how broken that is and I think
[34:49] Bitcoin can fix it we can still have
[34:51] that copyright
[34:53] infrastructure it's it's a lot like
[34:55] patents patents for inventions um you
[34:58] know and when when someone wants to use
[35:00] a part of a patent you know they'll pay
[35:02] a license fee to include that in their
[35:04] invention music's quite the same way if
[35:06] they want to use it in a commercial in a
[35:08] movie it all comes back to the the
[35:11] intellectual property ownership of that
[35:13] music and uh you say bitco can fix this
[35:18] with just instant uh lightning streams
[35:21] when something is used instantly you get
[35:24] something in your wallet right yeah so
[35:26] so if someone he's a song of mine on wav
[35:29] Lake and they like it they can zap me a
[35:32] th Satoshi and it's in my wallet that
[35:34] that day in that minute you know and and
[35:38] why does it take nine
[35:40] months because they collect the
[35:42] reporting takes a long time and then
[35:45] they have to shuffle through this
[35:46] reporting maybe they use software and
[35:48] some form of AI but it just it just
[35:51] takes honestly I don't really know what
[35:52] it takes n months it just takes n months
[35:55] because they have to collect money from
[35:57] around the world sometimes you have to
[35:59] build a minimum maybe you need $20
[36:01] minimum before you get that so then
[36:03] that's going to take time to build up so
[36:05] there's all these little things these
[36:06] inefficiencies in the music industry
[36:08] because we're using websites and
[36:11] spreadsheets to kind of keep track of
[36:13] this I think AI will improve it and I
[36:15] think once we have this type of stuff on
[36:17] a ledger like Bitcoin then it's going to
[36:19] improve it even better like even faster
[36:22] more efficient yeah this nine months is
[36:25] just like for me it's like wow well
[36:27] because of course it's a big challenge
[36:29] with like all around the world and then
[36:31] you have to pay out and stuff like that
[36:33] but in the end of the day it's just data
[36:35] entries you have to collect it if it
[36:36] takes a month or two months I can
[36:38] understand uh it's a standardized
[36:40] process it's not something that is like
[36:42] one time T it's like all all the time
[36:44] done so yeah but it's it's interesting
[36:47] to see and especially uh if you then
[36:50] count in inflation for yourself nine
[36:52] months that can a lot of things can
[36:54] happen like if there are bitcoiners out
[36:56] there that say the US dollar will not
[36:59] see the fiveyear mark and then maybe you
[37:01] are on the point where like all of the
[37:03] sudden uh your royalties are not worth
[37:07] anything because you did not get it in
[37:09] time uh and we have so many examples
[37:12] with Lebanon with Argentina where the de
[37:15] basement was just overnight with like
[37:17] 50% or something so nine months is a
[37:21] long
[37:22] time yeah it's too slow it's inefficient
[37:25] so yeah you're right absolutely
[37:27] absolutely yeah definitely um you wrote
[37:31] some line I just remember it on in your
[37:33] song about Peter Schiff uh liquidating
[37:36] his go to buy Bitcoin do you think this
[37:40] can ever
[37:42] happen yeah I think it can so that's
[37:45] that's why yeah in that most toxic
[37:47] Bitcoin Maxi song I have like almost
[37:50] predictions but I guess I come across
[37:52] like a news reporter but I think one day
[37:55] he might liquidate all his gold for
[37:56] Bitcoin who knows um I know gold is I
[37:59] still value gold but I just don't value
[38:02] it the same way that I value Bitcoin I
[38:03] know Bitcoin is better than gold but I
[38:05] still think gold is good to have a
[38:07] little bit of but I think Peter shf one
[38:10] day will maybe come around who knows I
[38:13] yeah but I think I like I like these
[38:15] little predictions because if it becomes
[38:17] true it's kind of awesome you know like
[38:20] yeah it's definitely it should like it's
[38:23] like the in The Simpsons there also like
[38:25] small predictions in there and I like
[38:27] that you also like build in predictions
[38:29] in in your songs and you have also if I
[38:32] remember correctly A1 million US dollar
[38:35] per bitcoin price with uh I think the
[38:37] same song also right oh this is in
[38:40] Bitcoin slang how does a million dollar
[38:41] Bitcoin sound yeah so I say that in
[38:44] Bitcoin slang but the thing is when I
[38:46] wrote that I recorded I didn't think
[38:48] much of it but then later on when the
[38:50] price started going up I thought it will
[38:52] hit a million dollars one day so what
[38:54] does that mean for that song people
[38:55] would be like he called it he called
[38:58] he called it I don't know like you can
[38:59] build a bit of a legend behind that so
[39:01] maybe that's what the Simpsons do I
[39:02] don't know maybe they got information we
[39:04] don't yeah um maybe like let's let's see
[39:07] what the but I also think like $1
[39:10] million per Bitcoin is such an huge
[39:13] number uh but at the end of the day if
[39:15] you actually break it down what Bitcoin
[39:17] is where it's going uh and then Michael
[39:20] sailor comes out and says yeah it's it's
[39:23] it's going to 47 uh million dollars and
[39:27] like that like there's there's so many
[39:29] crazy price predictions on there and the
[39:32] the thing that bothers me with that is
[39:34] that uh people still look for an exit
[39:37] like if you have the conversation how
[39:39] high can PE Bitcoin go then you always
[39:42] like oh then there's an exit to bitcoin
[39:45] no there's no exit to bitcoin no exit
[39:47] once you're in you know that you're in
[39:49] for for the for the remainder yeah um
[39:52] yeah that annoys me as well when people
[39:53] look for an exert you know and they
[39:55] don't understand because that means they
[39:56] just don't stand yet you know it's going
[39:58] to take them more time do do you have a
[40:01] price prediction for for this year
[40:03] because it's it's crazy what's going on
[40:05] and it can be at 30,000 it can be at a
[40:08] million I think I I I I don't exclude
[40:11] anything for this year because there's
[40:13] so many factors coming in but do you
[40:16] have some something in mind that can
[40:19] happen I I don't really do price
[40:22] predictions I think I think when I hear
[40:24] other people say 250 a Bitcoin like 2
[40:27] 50,000 USD that seems reasonable to me
[40:30] you know I've heard people say s M7
[40:33] billion Bitcoin over the next say 10
[40:36] years um and when I hear those arguments
[40:38] like there's one Guy Peter dunworth in
[40:40] Australia he calls Bitcoin a triple
[40:42] point Quantum assets and he he he
[40:46] because like Michael sailor makes um
[40:48] parallels to thermal dynamics and I
[40:50] think um Peter dunworth was also talking
[40:52] about this that when you have an when
[40:55] you have like water uh ice and and gas
[40:59] will steam in in the same position at
[41:01] the same time that's called the triple
[41:03] points in thermodynamics and then he
[41:05] added Quantum asset to that because you
[41:07] can send that to yourself 10 years from
[41:09] now um without it Landing in your wallet
[41:12] like I'm not sure what that's called the
[41:13] time locking aspect of Bitcoin and then
[41:16] he reckons Bitcoin can get to7 billion
[41:18] but I think it's I don't think it's
[41:20] unreasonable I think it's possible
[41:22] because of just how much money they're
[41:23] printing it all comes down to how much
[41:25] they're printing it's mathematically
[41:26] inevitable for it to get to a million
[41:28] and if it's mathematic mathematically
[41:30] inevitable for that then maybe 10
[41:32] million because I don't think the dollar
[41:34] is going to go away I just think it's
[41:35] going to keep going down in value maybe
[41:38] for another 10 20 years because I've
[41:40] already been waiting for the dollar to
[41:41] collapse for more than 15 years you know
[41:44] like and it still has still hasn't
[41:45] happened like so you don't so you don't
[41:47] think it will uh so it will stay uh
[41:51] forever the dollar or is it like
[41:53] something that maybe like 100 200 years
[41:56] maybe Fade Out
[41:58] yeah maybe maybe another 50 years we
[42:00] might still have the dollar but this is
[42:02] where where I'm not really an e
[42:04] Economist to be able to predict this
[42:06] kind of thing I mean I like the thought
[42:08] experiments and you know I like the
[42:10] rationalizing of is it possible but I
[42:13] feel that the dollar is that valuable
[42:16] to what would they call the industrial
[42:19] military complex like is that valuable
[42:22] that even if they take on bitcoin as a
[42:24] standard the dollar could be like this
[42:26] intermediate form of payment for certain
[42:29] stuff you know maybe they pay the plebs
[42:31] the universal basic income I'm not sure
[42:33] you know yeah there a lot going on even
[42:37] like a dollar can be a layer two three
[42:39] four on top of Bitcoin there will be so
[42:42] many layers and so many applications on
[42:44] top of Bitcoin developed and I'm Al
[42:47] always really bullish on the base layer
[42:49] being that's indestructible Force we
[42:51] have and then uh everyone can build on
[42:55] top of that uh the US US they can build
[42:58] uh the Dollar on top of it uh people can
[43:01] build second layers on top of that they
[43:04] can do whatever they want as long as we
[43:06] have this
[43:07] indestructible uh based layer and we
[43:10] have a free market on top of that that's
[43:12] I think the the best way to to look at
[43:15] it because there are so many Layer Two
[43:17] Solutions and then there are discussions
[43:19] should they allowed to be do this and
[43:21] that and I'm like of course they're
[43:23] allowed to do that it's a free market if
[43:25] if nobody accepts it it will will die
[43:27] anyway so Bitcoin Bitcoin is just coming
[43:31] yeah and uh yeah and for uh for the next
[43:37] question do you have like um something
[43:40] in mind what you do next like the you
[43:42] have the Bitcoin music uh you're doing
[43:45] podcast you're doing uh you're really
[43:48] active in the Bitcoin Community you're
[43:49] producing music um what do you look
[43:52] forward in in in your life for the next
[43:54] like one two five years what what is
[43:56] what is coming out more music more
[43:58] conferences more um in inperson um
[44:04] performances yeah I definitely want to
[44:06] do more conferences I definitely want to
[44:08] travel around the world I mean it would
[44:09] be a dream to be able to perform at the
[44:11] Miami Conference and along the way you
[44:14] know in Europe Portugal uh Singapore uh
[44:18] I would love to travel next year and do
[44:20] conferences that's why my goal for this
[44:22] conference is to do as good of a job as
[44:24] I can performing and just bring energy
[44:27] and bring excitement and entertainment
[44:29] to then have other people say we want
[44:31] him at our conference and I think that
[44:33] will happen you know I'm pretty I'm
[44:35] pretty dedicated to that but moving
[44:37] forward into my career what I'm trying
[44:39] to build here as as the Robbie P brand
[44:43] when we look at AI taking jobs away from
[44:46] people in labor and even the creative
[44:48] industry I think we are going towards a
[44:50] world where people won't have much to do
[44:53] for work and I think the one thing that
[44:55] can Outlast this is is a very solid
[44:57] personal brand so for me I'm just I'm
[45:01] I'm I'm I'm dialing in into my personal
[45:03] Brands to build something that can
[45:05] Outlast and something that an AI can't
[45:09] replace an AI an AI won't be able to
[45:11] replace me that's my goal here you know
[45:14] so and I and that comes into because
[45:16] understanding intellectual property
[45:18] understanding the music rights you know
[45:21] for example if if I die today my
[45:23] daughter has my music rights for 75
[45:26] years onwards you know like Mickey Mouse
[45:28] just more recently which was a Disney
[45:30] intellectual property item that's now in
[45:33] the free free Marketplace anyone can use
[45:35] Mickey Mouse do they want to I don't
[45:37] think so because of Hollywood and all
[45:39] the stuff that's come out in the last
[45:40] few years you know with the Shady Side
[45:42] of Hollywood but for me I I want to
[45:45] build a brand that that outlasts my life
[45:47] and is able to feed me and feed my
[45:50] family and um build awareness not only
[45:54] for what I'm doing but also Bitcoin
[45:58] yeah that's uh that's that's ex
[46:01] extremely amazing what you're doing and
[46:03] uh I think personal branding is
[46:05] something that's so underestimated even
[46:08] now uh and there's more like there are
[46:11] so many indicators there are more more
[46:13] content creators going and doing it
[46:15] full-time there's more more content
[46:18] creators building really big companies
[46:20] with it like if you look at the big ones
[46:22] like um Mr Beast who has uh really big
[46:27] companies around him now with febles and
[46:29] stuff like that he could be like the
[46:31] biggest chocolate brand in the world if
[46:33] he continues that way because he's just
[46:35] really good in marketing and then uh it
[46:38] all comes down okay if we have ai we
[46:40] have Robotics and we can make food with
[46:44] AI we can make all the things we need
[46:46] Like Houses like we build houses with
[46:49] robots like you send like oh I want the
[46:51] house and then five Roberts comes and
[46:54] then in a month uh the house stands
[46:56] because they work day and night uh they
[46:59] own shifts like they own battery have B
[47:02] battery packs or something like that so
[47:04] then then then it comes to the Future
[47:07] like what do humans do if robots kind of
[47:10] run the world uh and also something that
[47:13] I imagine and this is like the the best
[47:16] case scenario for everything that robots
[47:19] do the work that we don't want to do
[47:21] like clean and do the stuff that we just
[47:24] don't want to do like nobody I don't I
[47:26] don't think that many humans really want
[47:29] to be when it's like 40° outside be on a
[47:33] uh on a roof and and and put some hard
[47:36] things on top of each other like I think
[47:39] they rather do something um um um
[47:41] creative maybe but maybe that's just my
[47:43] subjective feeling um and then I'm like
[47:47] having a podcast speaking with PE people
[47:49] building the the future talking with
[47:52] documenting life documenting Earth
[47:54] that's what I'm really passionate about
[47:56] and what I do with with the podcast so
[47:59] that's really really cool um we have a
[48:02] an end routine in the podcast where the
[48:05] previous guest asked the next question
[48:07] uh question without knowing who's the
[48:09] next guest is at least I
[48:11] try I'm not talking about the next guest
[48:14] sometimes I'm failing that and the last
[48:17] qu last guest asks you the question what
[48:20] is the best movie uh about bit about
[48:23] money uh and it cannot be The Big Short
[48:29] okay the best movie about money I would
[48:31] say it's the Justin timlake movie I
[48:32] forgot the name though oh in time the in
[48:36] time are you familiar with this movie
[48:38] that's a the numbers are showing up on
[48:40] the thing yes yes but you know why the
[48:43] why I say this because at the end of the
[48:45] movie there's a million tokens in some
[48:48] safe somewhere and if that million
[48:49] tokens entered the marketplace it
[48:51] destabilizes their economy and that's
[48:53] exactly what we're looking at with a
[48:55] million million Bitcoin coins in
[48:57] satoshi's address so that that little
[48:59] parallel just really spins me out I
[49:02] would say it's in time with Justin
[49:03] Timberlake even though it's not about
[49:04] money but that's value that's what
[49:07] whatever that is the time it's value so
[49:09] I find that that's interesting yeah it's
[49:12] also in in the movie it's interesting
[49:14] that the people that are really wealthy
[49:17] because they have a lot of time they
[49:18] don't have to hurry they they are they
[49:21] can just slowly walk down the street and
[49:23] they can just relax and go down and
[49:25] people are like oh [ __ ] should I have
[49:27] one minute left to live they are in a
[49:30] hurry and they are stressful and I think
[49:32] there there there's so many life lessons
[49:35] in there uh outside of Bitcoin and and
[49:39] in connected with money like it's a
[49:41] totally must watch movie I think and
[49:44] yeah a great recommendation about a
[49:47] movie about money yeah yeah perfect it's
[49:50] also funny because like what breed love
[49:52] would say about money and energy and
[49:54] even Michael saor storing money and
[49:56] energy
[49:57] that's kind of what they're trying to do
[49:59] for them their whole life depends on it
[50:01] if they can store time and
[50:03] energy perfect for Bitcoin analogy you
[50:06] know so yeah I like it yeah and and time
[50:09] is also the only uh um resource we have
[50:13] that is more scarce than Bitcoin because
[50:17] time is really on an individual uh level
[50:20] running out for you you can uh you can
[50:23] work better you can invent something you
[50:25] get more Bitcoin for it
[50:27] if you lose your Bitcoin you can get
[50:29] more Bitcoin when you provide some value
[50:31] to other people but if you lose your
[50:34] time in like you're getting sick or
[50:36] you're not taking care of your body or
[50:38] something like that then you're really
[50:40] screwed at least for now maybe there's a
[50:42] future where you can buy with Bitcoin
[50:44] more time because there's some advant in
[50:47] in medicine but like this is then the
[50:49] future stuff so uh Robbie thank you for
[50:52] for for being on is there anything you
[50:54] would like to add to the podcast and
[50:56] where I can get people the best way in
[50:58] touch with you yeah so people can sign
[51:01] up to my mailing list which is the
[51:03] Bitcoin Centric mailing list Bitcoins
[51:05] slang.com it's actually a substack
[51:07] account and I'm my goal is to add more
[51:10] content like articles and writing kind
[51:12] of like what you do with your tweets um
[51:14] but that's probably the best place to
[51:16] offer me the email address then I can
[51:17] contact people whenn something special
[51:19] an event like the bit a live conference
[51:21] comes up also Robbie p.net which is just
[51:24] like the link tree of all my links my
[51:26] latest songs and if people want to
