[00:00] we're going to get at least one state
[00:01] that signs legislation in the next while
[00:03] we're talking to numerous States right
[00:05] now there's efforts going on and at
[00:07] least 10 I came up with an $813,000
[00:10] price for Bitcoin the economic model
[00:12] gives a first estimate of where that
[00:14] Supply shot comes I don't see it really
[00:17] fully kicking in until we get down to a
[00:19] 1 million Bitcoin liquid Supply but if
[00:21] we hit Supply shock the price is going
[00:23] to go astronomical it will go like 5
[00:26] million or 10 million or more than that
[00:28] before it even starts to slow down we're
[00:30] increasingly going into a more volatile
[00:33] region of price discovery not a less
[00:35] volatile one I don't believe that we're
[00:37] going into a of diminishing returns I
[00:39] think we're going to go the other
[00:40] direction if you're looking on a 3 to 5e
[00:42] time Horizon say that your expected
[00:44] value should be including 5 and 10
[00:46] million options for
[00:48] [Music]
[00:52] Bitcoin you are one of the few doctors
[00:56] that I have on my show I think like uh
[01:00] Academia is not as as into Bitcoin as as
[01:04] uh we we wanted to have them yeah I
[01:08] unfortunately not yet uh but that is
[01:10] definitely something that needs to come
[01:12] and I'm sure it will come academics are
[01:14] pretty mercenary a lot sometimes they go
[01:16] where the research money is and uh that
[01:18] will come eventually yeah absolutely um
[01:22] so so you're thinking that uh the
[01:24] research money is basically kind of
[01:26] preventing uh or it's like a hurdle that
[01:29] a lot of academ IA is is is coming into
[01:31] Bitcoin yeah I I I I think so I mean
[01:35] when you look at it there there's
[01:36] certain disciplines that people are more
[01:40] you know able to do what they want to
[01:42] like their own specific research areas
[01:45] but if you're looking sort of at the big
[01:47] energy
[01:49] environment um Financial intersection
[01:52] that that interface that's going to be
[01:54] really really important for Bitcoin um
[01:57] those are big research programs so it
[01:58] takes a while to get the research the
[02:01] donors need to get familiar with the
[02:04] concept that Bitcoin might not be as bad
[02:07] as everyone has been led to believe in
[02:08] the academic space and then uh once
[02:11] there's a research uh money that starts
[02:14] to flow into the space that will really
[02:17] uh impact the Dynamics of what happens
[02:19] and and how things progress but um
[02:22] especially for the big team research
[02:24] which is really common especially like
[02:25] over in Europe uh The Horizon Research
[02:27] Pro uh programs uh uh to be able to get
[02:30] to a stage there where it's the donors
[02:33] Des like are very prescriptive about
[02:35] what type of research needs to be done
[02:37] it will take a while to get there for
[02:39] Bitcoin and you did uh research previous
[02:42] a lot on on environmental stuff
[02:46] um what did you research there and and
[02:49] how did you then end up with with coming
[02:51] to bitcoin uh yeah um I I had sort of a
[02:55] strange background from an academic
[02:57] perspective I dropped out of University
[02:59] 3 three times um along the way and got
[03:03] distracted and often Tangen by things
[03:05] but um my I have a a technical diploma
[03:10] in aquaculture and fishery so I spent
[03:12] about a decade in um aquaculture both
[03:15] here in uh Canada where I'm based on the
[03:17] west coast now and also overseas in
[03:20] Southeast Asia and then I when I was in
[03:23] that I got really interested in
[03:24] agricultural economics because there was
[03:26] so many of the problems when you're out
[03:28] actually doing farming uh um there's a
[03:31] lot of the things that you need to make
[03:32] decisions about that it it's really
[03:35] interesting from an uh from a academic
[03:37] economic perspective so I went back to
[03:39] school and did undergrad and master's
[03:43] degrees in agricultural economics and
[03:46] really got in introduced to
[03:47] environmental economics at that time and
[03:50] then uh when I did my PhD it was uh very
[03:52] much an environmental Focus uh uh going
[03:56] through I was actually working on my PhD
[03:58] dissertation was on uh Reish
[04:00] conservation in the Caribbean I spent
[04:02] time down on the Turks and Kos Islands
[04:05] uh working and uh doing research at the
[04:07] same time I love that um maybe let's
[04:10] just uh directly jump in with that how
[04:13] does and I think Bitcoin but probably
[04:16] Bitcoin mining uh in in in specific uh
[04:20] what does Bitcoin mining contribute for
[04:23] the environment what can Bitcoin mining
[04:25] do uh for the environmental uh science
[04:29] in general
[04:30] yeah well I think everybody in in the
[04:32] space is probably pretty familiar with
[04:34] it but many people outside the space are
[04:37] completely uh surprised by what Bitcoin
[04:39] can do and the idea that uh any energy
[04:43] source uh can be used for Bitcoin
[04:45] whether it's remote whether it's like a
[04:47] waste gas site whether it's a landfill
[04:50] site um any type of energy that's
[04:53] available can be used for Bitcoin and
[04:55] and the typical reaction might be from
[04:58] people unfamiliar with Bitcoin mining is
[05:00] that well that's that's a danger I mean
[05:02] we we see more and more energy being
[05:04] allocated to uh Bitcoin but what it does
[05:07] is it really helps improve the economics
[05:10] of uh renewable energy and it improves
[05:13] the economics of waste cleanup and uh so
[05:17] there's lots of different uh areas that
[05:20] have potential for using uh energy
[05:24] that's completely not used right now and
[05:26] uh directing it uh towards an activity
[05:29] that can help monetize and support uh
[05:32] different types of facilities and for
[05:35] example on that um we did some work at
[05:37] Satoshi action with um in combination or
[05:40] in conjunction with the people from noal
[05:41] energy and they have landfill gas sites
[05:44] down in Utah New Mexico so we did an
[05:46] economic study on um uh basically how
[05:51] how economically viable and what sort of
[05:54] costs uh could be covered by landfill
[05:57] mining so something like landfill has to
[05:59] be done done anyway and uh whether or
[06:02] not uh like a Bitcoin mining uh mine is
[06:05] purely profitable from a business
[06:07] perspective that's kind of like marginal
[06:10] uh with some of the sites but certainly
[06:13] for uh landfills um being able to put
[06:16] Bitcoin miners in helps recover costs
[06:19] because you can sell Bitcoin into a
[06:20] global 247 Market uh that helps offset
[06:24] the costs and ultimately that should
[06:26] reduce the uh tax burden for local uh um
[06:30] citizens in the area and um so there's
[06:33] this whole the whole waste energy sphere
[06:36] is uh one one area and then from a
[06:39] renewable energy perspective it's
[06:41] certainly the case that uh Bitcoin can
[06:44] improve the economics of renewable
[06:45] energy whether that's Hydro uh Power or
[06:50] uh wind and particularly wind and uh
[06:53] solar that are highly variable um we can
[06:56] uh use Bitcoin mining to come in and and
[06:59] take up the um the excess energy that's
[07:03] being produced say solar uh solar energy
[07:06] typically you get different uh demand
[07:08] Peaks during the day and so a lot of
[07:11] your solar comes uh midm morning sort of
[07:13] to noon early afternoon when demand
[07:15] typically isn't that high that energy
[07:17] can be fed into Bitcoin help offset the
[07:20] cost for running the solar facility uh
[07:23] wind is same thing what happens if your
[07:24] wind blows at night and you can't store
[07:26] it um right now battery storage is
[07:28] typically you might get up to 4 hours um
[07:32] it will help in the evening but it won't
[07:34] like it's not a complete solution so
[07:37] Bitcoin mining during the night can uh
[07:40] generate uh money for uh different types
[07:42] of renewable energy operations that
[07:45] helps offset their costs that by and by
[07:48] offsetting their costs that means that
[07:50] renewable energy producers can expand
[07:52] the scope of their operations and uh
[07:55] contribute to um increasing the level of
[07:59] renew abl in a in a grid or in within a
[08:02] country there's so many interesting uh
[08:05] things in there it's also like I heard
[08:07] about a project uh on an apartment
[08:09] building where there's a Bitcoin mining
[08:12] facility in the basement and they are
[08:15] helping uh reducing the cost of
[08:18] electricity uh for that apartment
[08:20] building with that Bitcoin mining
[08:22] facility that that's just so many
[08:24] different great use cases for that yeah
[08:27] yeah and it's really interesting to
[08:28] start to think but waste heat is a as a
[08:31] resource and um in the I I I I failed my
[08:36] first year University chemistry course
[08:38] and thought I'd never worked with
[08:39] chemist but it ends up over my career
[08:41] I've worked a a lot with environmental
[08:44] chemists and so they talk about
[08:46] valorization of waste product streams
[08:48] and which just is a fancy way of saying
[08:50] that um you know all for chemical waste
[08:53] there's ways to extract some of the
[08:55] valuable chemicals and and use them in
[08:57] other applications and in many ways uh
[09:00] the waste heat is like the Bitcoin
[09:03] mining streams that's what needs to be
[09:05] valorized or commoditized or um uh
[09:08] monetized uh waste heat as a product
[09:10] there's Farms that are uh using Bitcoin
[09:14] miners for um uh basically biod
[09:19] digesting U manure and then using that
[09:22] energy for uh Bitcoin mining and then
[09:25] some of the waste heat from that
[09:27] operation goes back into keeping their
[09:30] facilities warm so there's options like
[09:32] that there's options with landfill sites
[09:34] to um help generate local heat for
[09:37] industry or for residential uh uh
[09:40] District Heating and there's also if you
[09:43] go to developing countries there's all
[09:45] sorts of opportunities for um using
[09:49] Bitcoin to help to uh Finance local
[09:52] electricity grids maybe hydroelectric I
[09:55] think is primarily the option right now
[09:58] uh but by having the miners there is the
[10:00] core customer they can uh uh up the
[10:04] electricity production from local Hydro
[10:07] facilities that were going underutilized
[10:10] so that energy the electricity that's
[10:12] generated from that energy can then be
[10:14] passed off to the communities basically
[10:16] free of charge and uh help to Electrify
[10:19] communities that are uh don't have uh uh
[10:22] electrical connections uh currently so
[10:24] that's a whole step change uh for social
[10:26] benefits as well interesting I love that
[10:30] and there there there's so many great
[10:32] applications in there and why do you
[10:34] think there still so many voices out
[10:37] there that say oh Bitcoin is bad for the
[10:38] environment it uses too much energy all
[10:40] those things it seems to be last year
[10:42] that those voices got more and more
[10:44] silent and I don't hear it that often
[10:46] but they are still out there yeah
[10:48] they're still out there I mean a lot of
[10:50] it is that people don't take things
[10:52] seriously and um you know my the
[10:56] academic writing that I've done I I view
[10:58] that the main goal of that is
[11:01] to really educate people in the academic
[11:04] space that's that's that's what who my
[11:07] audience is for most of the writing that
[11:09] I do and so I tend to write for a fairly
[11:12] interdisciplinary crowd that uh and with
[11:17] the goal of just like really trying to
[11:19] open the eyes up that hey this maybe
[11:22] isn't exactly what you thought uh that
[11:25] there are all these potential benefits
[11:27] and yes it's energy intense Ive uh but
[11:31] we we have all these there there's just
[11:33] so many considerations that come in at
[11:35] the same time that you have to consider
[11:36] if you're looking the big picture you
[11:38] have to consider the waste energy you
[11:40] have to consider the impact on uh the
[11:43] scope of different types of energy uh
[11:46] use uh the expansion of Renewables also
[11:49] potentially which could be viewed on the
[11:51] negative side you might make uh existing
[11:53] oil and gas facilities more uh
[11:56] economically viable uh of course by mon
[11:59] in waste Gast which uh some people would
[12:01] view as a negative uh but you also need
[12:04] to think uh for academics I think you
[12:07] need to be looking at the big picture
[12:08] and thinking well what what's the what's
[12:11] the status quo situation when in you
[12:13] know in policy research we always like
[12:15] to consider a status quo situation
[12:18] versus an alternative a case where
[12:20] you're doing something so we bring in
[12:22] the Bitcoin Miners and install Bitcoin
[12:24] mining on a w widespread basis what are
[12:28] what's the value valid comparison should
[12:31] we be comparing to an energy future
[12:33] where we we like cap our energy use
[12:36] totally or uh you know the financial
[12:39] system do we look at how much energy The
[12:42] Current financial system uses versus the
[12:44] potential Alternatives what are the
[12:46] substitution effects in there with
[12:48] Bitcoin um so there's all sorts of
[12:50] really complex questions that that are
[12:52] out there that need to be answered and
[12:55] anybody that blows off the questions
[12:56] like too quickly probably just hasn't
[12:58] even taking a look at Bitcoin and
[13:00] they're negative on it for whatever
[13:02] historical reason or personal bias or in
[13:05] some cases just a lack of time they just
[13:07] like chalk it up to spam and and uh
[13:10] don't think about it so it really it's a
[13:13] there's this huge awareness building uh
[13:16] processes needed within the academic
[13:17] space I think yeah there like a time
[13:21] time that's needed to educate people is
[13:23] that where your main focus with the
[13:25] satosi action education is is going
[13:28] towards researching environmental and
[13:31] also economic stuff and and putting it
[13:33] out there for the academics also yeah uh
[13:36] like my end is with Satoshi action so
[13:38] I've been but technically I'm part-time
[13:40] but functionally I'm full-time um and
[13:43] I've
[13:44] been connected with Dennis uh Porter
[13:47] like over two years ago now so I've been
[13:49] working uh with with uh him and Satoshi
[13:52] action ever since so there's there's two
[13:54] roles and one is on the academic
[13:56] research side to try to uh help fac
[13:59] facilitate getting research out whether
[14:01] it's our own or whether it's uh other
[14:03] research we'd like to see more
[14:04] researchers out in the space that's very
[14:07] important because um I mean we can get
[14:09] into it later on if you want but there's
[14:11] a whole world of editors and reviewers
[14:14] that need to be dealt with in the
[14:15] academic space and the more people we
[14:17] have publishing on bitcoin that
[14:19] understand Bitcoin the better that side
[14:21] of it is um but we besides the research
[14:25] there's also I do uh support um I to
[14:29] research support for the uh lobbying
[14:32] efforts uh so we have separate
[14:34] organizations for education and for
[14:36] lobbying but uh for instance like the
[14:39] the energy the landfill methane paper
[14:42] that I mentioned before it really was
[14:45] something that uh could contribute to
[14:48] you know education and awareness
[14:50] building on the on the uh State Side uh
[14:54] with energy organizations and then uh
[14:57] now in the last while with all our focus
[14:59] on the Strategic Reserve uh funds at the
[15:02] state level uh I've been doing a lot the
[15:04] last couple of months I've been really
[15:05] busy with uh straight economics research
[15:08] so right now for instance I'm just
[15:10] wrapping up a study where I looked at
[15:13] the 50 states uh in the
[15:16] US and did a counterfactual study so we
[15:19] said what would have happened if all the
[15:20] states each each of the US states
[15:22] apparently has a rainy day fund like um
[15:26] sort of um for emergency draw Downs or
[15:28] un seen circumstances and um so what I
[15:33] did with in that was I looked back to
[15:35] 2000 the start of 2018 and what would
[15:38] have happened if the rainy day funds uh
[15:40] for each state had invested in a
[15:42] combination of Bitcoin and gold uh what
[15:45] what combinations could have kept ahead
[15:47] of inflation and maintained purchasing
[15:50] power and so that's we had uh yesterday
[15:53] there was hearings in North Dakota New
[15:55] Hampshire that Satoshi action uh people
[15:58] were were out at and um so the work that
[16:03] I do is partly to it's not so much about
[16:07] educating academics in that that uh case
[16:10] I'm preparing materials that can help to
[16:12] educate the um you know the state people
[16:15] the policy people the policy uh shop
[16:18] analysts as well as the um uh
[16:20] legislators that uh uh danis and Eric
[16:23] Peterson are our policy director are
[16:26] working with so it's about providing in
[16:29] the evidence that Bitcoin would be an
[16:33] amazing decision also on a state and
[16:35] National level uh uh for them to use uh
[16:41] economically yeah yeah and it was really
[16:44] interesting uh because the States you
[16:46] know they their rainy day funds will go
[16:48] up or down they only publish a uh their
[16:51] uh stats annually so I I had to sort of
[16:54] like manipulate that and bring it back
[16:56] into divy it up on a daily base so so uh
[17:00] but yeah it was fascinating because what
[17:01] happened was that some states like in
[17:03] this counterfactual analysis it's like
[17:06] some states you looked at it in the
[17:07] states the way they their rainy day fund
[17:10] draws went up and down um they would
[17:13] have been total like fomo investors you
[17:15] know they they would be buying the Peaks
[17:17] and then selling selling the troughs and
[17:19] so the performance the performance was
[17:21] always better than the alternative and
[17:23] we we I used for a status quo um uh
[17:27] scenario I used uh uh overnight funds
[17:30] like so basically a proxy for treasuries
[17:33] and so the the idea was that states
[17:36] could either put all their 100% of their
[17:38] funds into treasuries or they could put
[17:41] up to 10% into Bitcoin and uh 10% into
[17:45] gold in various
[17:47] combinations and um every every one of
[17:50] those combinations whether it was 1%
[17:52] gold and 0% Bitcoin or 10% Bitcoin and
[17:56] 0% gold every one of them gave gave
[17:59] better performance than the status quo
[18:01] uh scenario so right off the bat like a
[18:04] lot of people were are concerned
[18:07] obviously with bitcoin's volatility that
[18:09] maybe it's a bad investment but we were
[18:11] able to go through and really show and
[18:14] demonstrate that over that time period
[18:17] uh having Bitcoin was really a big
[18:19] positive for portfolios there were
[18:21] sometimes that it would Drew down it was
[18:23] a a negative performer but uh our
[18:26] analysis started January 1st 2018 of
[18:28] course that was the start of the big
[18:29] bare market for
[18:31] 201819 and uh so you couldn't have
[18:33] picked like a wor worse place to start
[18:35] from a like from a market timing
[18:37] perspective but um everything was up and
[18:40] in some cases we had a few states that
[18:42] if they would have invested they would
[18:45] have actually been like very prudent
[18:46] investors they would have been buying
[18:48] the uh bare markets and then either
[18:51] holding steady or or selling uh during
[18:54] the the bull uh phases and um even with
[18:58] the 10% Bitcoin allocation like they
[19:01] could have had rainy defense that were
[19:03] up as as high as 90% in one case uh over
[19:06] a seven-year time frame so that's like
[19:08] really substantial uh that might be too
[19:10] risky for State investors but like
[19:13] certainly two three 5% um uh level of in
[19:17] investment in Bitcoin is something that
[19:20] when you look at the Historical
[19:22] performance in this counterfactual it's
[19:23] something that looks pretty attractive
[19:26] that's an that's an political argument
[19:29] that's massive when you think about a
[19:32] 10% Bitcoin allocation and with that
[19:35] almost doubling the rainy day fund that
[19:39] that that seems to be and that's seven
[19:41] years it's not like oh like 100 years or
[19:43] something like that yeah it's really
[19:45] interesting like in this paper that I'm
[19:47] working on right now like literally I
[19:49] just finished the analysis like two days
[19:51] ago and U so I'm writing right now and
[19:54] hopefully we'll have a draft paper up
[19:56] maybe later next week but certainly
[19:59] sometime this month and um yeah it was
[20:03] really it was really interesting and
[20:04] what I found really interesting and it
[20:06] was looking at the say like so if you
[20:09] imagine that if you wanted to say okay
[20:12] what do we need to do to maintain
[20:14] purchasing power and there was various
[20:17] combinations and the reason we included
[20:19] gold was because a lot of the state
[20:21] legis uh legislators and the state
[20:24] legislation already allows for precious
[20:27] metals to be held within uh invested in
[20:31] within rainy day funds so we're sort of
[20:33] trying to align Bitcoin with the
[20:35] existing uh um legislation when possible
[20:40] so there's there's interest also in Gold
[20:42] maybe works as a bit of a hedge on draw
[20:44] Downs so what we one of the findings was
[20:48] that like we could go to like if we went
[20:51] to 1% Bitcoin
[20:53] allocation and in combination with that
[20:55] 9% gold would uh basically offset the
[20:58] the effects of CPI inflation doesn't
[21:01] cover debasement but it covers
[21:03] inflation and then when you go to a 2%
[21:06] Bitcoin allocation you only need 2% gold
[21:08] and then when you go to 3% Bitcoin
[21:10] allocation you don't need any gold at
[21:12] all so if I was a state rainy day fund
[21:15] manager I'd be looking at those
[21:17] scenarios where it's 96% treasuries and
[21:20] 2% gold and 2% Bitcoin or 97% treasuries
[21:25] in zero gold and 3% Bitcoin and thinking
[21:29] wow if I can preserve my purchasing
[21:31] power with just a like a two to three%
[21:34] or a three to four% allocation of my um
[21:37] funds away from uh treasuries that would
[21:40] certainly be something that would be
[21:41] grabbing my
[21:43] attention and especially like 3% even
[21:47] like it's not as risky like if you have
[21:50] 3% and it's that 3% maybe has a
[21:54] volatility of let's say 20% even 30%
[21:58] which be high in like a few months or
[22:00] something like that yeah you don't even
[22:02] really see it like that that does not
[22:03] even function like because it's maximum
[22:05] volatility 10 3% it's not that that big
[22:08] of a deal yeah yeah it's not that big of
[22:10] a deal so that that's interesting the
[22:12] other thing that was interesting it too
[22:13] was I just looked at a like for a
[22:16] baseline like what happens if a state
[22:18] put money in and they did nothing like
[22:20] they didn't even invest in treasuries
[22:22] and uh yeah it's just being it's I was
[22:25] actually pretty shocked but it was like
[22:27] a 30% devalue valuation over seven years
[22:31] uh 30% ballpark it wasn't I might have
[22:33] been a little bit less than that but it
[22:35] was a really substantial loss and
[22:37] purchasing power uh for if you would
[22:39] have had any type of investment or sorry
[22:41] not investment if you would have just
[22:43] basically had your cash allocation made
[22:46] on January 1 and just left it and done
[22:48] absolutely nothing with it uh you'd be
[22:50] down like yeah almost almost 30% yeah
[22:54] and 30% uh for a rainy day fund where I
[22:58] don't know do do you know what what on
[23:00] an average there how much money there is
[23:03] in is in there is it like a few hundred
[23:05] millions or uh no you're looking usually
[23:08] higher more than that you're looking
[23:09] maybe typically somewhere between half a
[23:12] billion and about four billion W so like
[23:15] uh if you have like a billion uh in
[23:17] there and you lose 30% then it's like
[23:20] 300 million that you lose in purchasing
[23:22] bar yeah yeah and and so even and um and
[23:26] then if you're all treasuries you're not
[23:29] you you know you're you're you're saving
[23:31] some of that but you're you're not
[23:33] getting up even if you were all
[23:34] treasuries over that that seveny year
[23:36] period you wouldn't uh you'd still be
[23:39] losing purchasing power and so from
[23:42] again from a education perspective and
[23:44] an awareness building perspective that's
[23:46] what that's what we were able to show
[23:49] using this background research and
[23:50] that's a very powerful message when you
[23:52] start to go and you talk to State people
[23:55] and say look it you know you could you
[23:56] could go 100% treasuries and be safe but
[23:59] you're losing purchasing power you know
[24:00] your your rainy fund is being eroded
[24:03] away even as it is and then but if you
[24:06] allocate you know say 1% to gold and two
[24:10] or 3% to bitcoin very conservative still
[24:13] uh then you're at least at a minimum
[24:15] going be able to preserve your
[24:16] purchasing power and so that's that's a
[24:18] sort of message that that really
[24:20] resonates with the state
[24:22] people and that that is an amazing
[24:25] message of like okay uh you're losing in
[24:27] seven years is that 300 million if you
[24:30] have a billion dollars in in in a rainy
[24:33] day fund but only with like a 3% risk
[24:37] which I don't see as a risk but they
[24:39] probably see it as a risk Bitcoin asset
[24:42] you can completely offset that and the
[24:44] risk is really minimal because it's just
[24:46] 3% uh that that's an amazing story I I
[24:49] love that yeah now I you know of course
[24:52] the obvious next step to be would be go
[24:54] and include debasement in there too so I
[24:57] have to think a bit about how that would
[24:59] be handled like doing CPI inflation is
[25:01] really easy because all the stats are
[25:03] there um you know maybe you use M2 money
[25:08] supplies appr proxy and then calculate I
[25:11] mean the numbers that are sort of thrown
[25:12] around in the Bitcoin spaces that if
[25:15] inflation is CPI inflation is 3% maybe
[25:17] your debasement is maybe twice that much
[25:20] like 6% or so and if you're getting up
[25:24] if you could de like if we could
[25:25] demonstrate that debasement was like
[25:27] five or 6% % plus your CPI inflation and
[25:31] then all of a sudden that then that
[25:33] really really erods your your purchasing
[25:35] power even uh quicker and that would be
[25:38] what would help justify you know maybe a
[25:40] 5% allocation into Bitcoin or even
[25:43] higher than that um so that that remains
[25:47] well I'm not sure if I'll go ahead and
[25:50] and continue with that there's there's
[25:51] many different things sort of on the
[25:53] play right now that are being juggled
[25:54] around but I think that's the in this
[25:57] sort of stream of research that we're
[25:59] doing that's the next logical question
[26:02] that's that's also super interesting the
[26:05] weaker the currency gets the faster the
[26:07] basis the higher you have to uh put the
[26:11] Bitcoin allocation in because you have
[26:14] to offset that of course if you have
[26:15] just minimal inflation you don't need a
[26:18] lot to offset that if you have a high
[26:20] inflation you need more to offset that
[26:22] yeah I mean obviously inflation as uh as
[26:26] as many know is an an
[26:28] subjective metric like everyone everyone
[26:31] has his personal inflation rate
[26:34] depending on what you do if you want uh
[26:36] this this house on the lake or the beach
[26:38] from property uh you want to eat in in
[26:41] great restaurants and stuff like that
[26:43] your inflation rate is way higher than
[26:45] the average if you just I don't know
[26:47] live at your mom's basement and watch
[26:50] Netflix all day you inflation rate maybe
[26:52] it's even like deflationary your life
[26:55] yeah what what do you think is the best
[26:58] metric to kind of keep track of
[27:01] inflation because CPI seems very low for
[27:03] me yeah I I
[27:06] mean th this like I'll qualify by saying
[27:10] that like this type of financial
[27:12] economics is not my area so like there's
[27:15] things in here that I don't like fully
[27:18] understand yet and there's things that I
[27:19] wouldn't be able to crank off and answer
[27:21] for but if you look at other like hard
[27:25] assets you look at real estate what's
[27:26] Real Estate done like in in the United
[27:29] States uh and in uh Europe and in Canada
[27:33] uh what have real estate pric has done
[27:35] over the past s years and uh like I know
[27:39] in my local listings I mean I'm seeing
[27:41] places here in Vancouver Island that are
[27:43] up like oh geez like eight like I I saw
[27:47] something yesterday that was an 8X
[27:49] increase over the last 10 years and uh
[27:53] uh s sort of like um you know that's
[27:56] just for for Real Estate that's that's a
[27:58] huge amount uh to go up so I would sort
[28:01] of think that maybe like a tracking a
[28:03] real estate index would be a good proxy
[28:07] for debasement uh or debasement and
[28:09] inflation combined I'm not really sure
[28:12] about that that would have to that'd be
[28:13] something else to be worked out but I
[28:15] think that something along that line
[28:17] would probably be the a better like um a
[28:21] potential substitute for for uh
[28:24] debasement and uh I'd have to look out
[28:27] into the existing
[28:28] uh literature on it though I know lots
[28:30] of people in Bitcoin certainly have uh
[28:32] their opinions about what debasement uh
[28:35] rates actually are uh I'm not sure the
[28:38] few sometimes I I go out into the
[28:40] financial economics literature and I
[28:42] think oh well let's let's find something
[28:44] that there's a really easy answer to and
[28:46] then I find out that really there's not
[28:48] an easy answer to it and uh um which is
[28:53] unfortunate yeah we we like easy answers
[28:56] but most of the times it's it's it's
[28:58] hard as it seems well s sort of related
[29:01] to that like I've got another paper that
[29:04] uh I'm working on with some Bitcoin
[29:05] academics actually it's on hold right
[29:07] now it's about it's about time
[29:09] preferences and so you know my my career
[29:13] has been in the environmental uh space
[29:15] in academic so like I've been really
[29:17] exposed to this whole you know the very
[29:20] left
[29:22] leaning um you know I I mean I taught
[29:25] climate policy economics before uh I've
[29:27] taught it for years um and within the
[29:32] within the environmental space there's
[29:34] this um you know there's this idea that
[29:38] you well there's not I sorry let me
[29:41] start that again within the
[29:42] environmental space time preferences are
[29:45] super important but they're not
[29:46] recognized as such so uh one of the
[29:50] things that uh with this time preference
[29:52] paper that we're working on I like my
[29:55] presumption was that like left leaning
[29:57] sort of socialist or left leaning
[30:00] governments would be more prone to uh
[30:03] spend money on mitigation than right
[30:06] leaning governments and so I made some
[30:09] comments in this paper when I did the
[30:11] draft about how it was I assumed that um
[30:15] you know your left leing governments are
[30:16] going to be like I just took it as an
[30:19] assumpt or a given the the left leaning
[30:23] governments be would be more willing to
[30:24] spend on mitigation upfront mitigation
[30:27] so spend now to prevent climate change
[30:29] later and uh I thought well that would
[30:32] be an easy thing to go into the academic
[30:34] literature and prove and it turns out
[30:36] that there's not really any clear answer
[30:38] out um about which political leaning
[30:42] which way your political leaning of a
[30:44] government actually affects inflation
[30:47] you can't go and say a right leaning uh
[30:49] uh government is less likely to cause
[30:52] inflation uh than a left leaning
[30:54] government so that was a surprise to me
[30:58] I mean yeah it's like but once you're in
[31:00] power you want to uh spend money and
[31:03] they're usually debating on what to
[31:05] spend money on but they're usually not
[31:07] debating if they spend money yeah yeah
[31:10] yeah and now you know you look to the US
[31:12] and to the Trump Administration coming
[31:13] in and there's inflation fears and you
[31:16] know it's like well if they're look at
[31:19] inflation over the past like you know
[31:22] eight eight years or um 12 years however
[31:25] really back to the Clint uh I guess back
[31:27] at the Clinton government was maybe the
[31:29] last time that inflation was sort of
[31:30] under
[31:31] control um but yeah there's like there's
[31:35] no certainly no guarantee that there's
[31:37] going to be a more uh Frugal um
[31:40] government that U combats inflation
[31:42] coming up no matter what the political
[31:44] uh stripe is but back to like the
[31:47] climate change argument so the in the
[31:49] climate change space there's you can
[31:50] either mitigate climate change so that's
[31:53] investing now to prevent climate change
[31:55] off in the future
[31:58] or you can basically let things slide
[32:01] right now and uh increase your invest in
[32:04] other things to increase your abap
[32:05] adaptive capacity so when if and when
[32:09] climate change becomes a
[32:11] problem uh your society's better able to
[32:14] adapt so you can invest in health and
[32:16] education and all sorts of other things
[32:18] with the knowledge that uh empirically
[32:21] that that those those factors really
[32:24] help people over the longer term cope
[32:26] with stress now of course the problem
[32:29] the climate uh change space is that well
[32:31] what happens if we hit uh tipping points
[32:34] and so there's the the there's this
[32:36] constant argument in the climate policy
[32:38] World about you know what's the proper
[32:40] balance between mitigation and
[32:42] adaptation and uh that all depends on on
[32:46] Time preferences and so it's fascinating
[32:49] to me that you know there's this Bitcoin
[32:51] World which is heavily in influenced by
[32:54] Austrian economics where time
[32:56] preferences are very important and all
[32:58] of a sudden time preference like
[32:59] everybody in the Bitcoin space talks
[33:00] about time preferences and it's like
[33:02] nobody in any other space talks about
[33:04] time preferences like it's you have to
[33:07] you have to go through it's the whole
[33:08] education process anybody out in
[33:11] academics outside that particular area
[33:14] or that particular Niche niche in
[33:16] economics uh really don't understand T
[33:19] time preferences and discount rates at
[33:20] all so it's it's a really bitcoin's an
[33:23] interesting space from that perspective
[33:25] I partnered up with coin vigilante this
[33:29] is the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[33:32] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[33:35] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[33:37] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[33:41] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[33:44] go out there and show that you are a
[33:46] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[33:49] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[33:52] dropped a completely new and amazing
[33:55] Genesis edition of their watch
[33:57] collections you have the date of the
[34:00] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[34:03] and of course also the block height and
[34:06] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[34:09] the level of detail they put in in this
[34:12] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[34:14] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[34:17] down in the descriptions I love those
[34:19] watches so so much if you watch or
[34:23] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[34:25] I'll guess you already bought some
[34:27] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[34:30] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[34:33] in a hardware wallet my personal
[34:35] recommendation for hard wallet is the
[34:37] bitbox it's super secure it's simple to
[34:40] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[34:42] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[34:45] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[34:49] with the code Robin at the checkout
[34:51] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[34:55] your bitbox and the next step is to
[34:57] really level up your sovereignty as an
[35:00] individual you have to have the most
[35:02] secure self- custody setup you have to
[35:05] secure your own devices you have to
[35:07] protect your privacy you have to set up
[35:10] an inheritance plan and depending on
[35:13] where you live you even want to have a
[35:15] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[35:18] in case something goes really really
[35:20] wrong and through all those steps the
[35:22] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[35:25] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[35:27] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[35:31] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[35:34] how you can level up your sovereignty
[35:37] absolutely yeah it's it's and and the
[35:40] political thing is also interesting uh
[35:42] just to add here uh I think I think
[35:45] especially Trump uh wants to have lower
[35:47] interest rates and especially in his
[35:49] first term he was always proponent of
[35:52] that and lower interest rates make the
[35:54] dollar weaker but there is
[35:56] no um no metric for that people don't
[35:59] value if the dollar is weaker or higher
[36:02] they value inflation rates but uh they
[36:04] are not that big of a problem as long as
[36:07] the US dollar is the world Reserve uh
[36:11] currency and the stock prices go up and
[36:13] that's kind of like oh like stock prices
[36:15] go up so the economy must be great yeah
[36:18] yeah and then the president has done a
[36:20] great job so I don't know that that
[36:23] system seems to be a little bit off but
[36:25] maybe maybe we see a lot of Bitcoin
[36:28] things in the next term let's let's see
[36:29] what happens yeah yeah the other thing
[36:33] that has always confused me about the
[36:36] government particular the last Trump
[36:38] Administration is that you know I I I
[36:41] view interest rates as a function of
[36:43] uncertainty like there's a certain view
[36:46] within economics it's like or discount
[36:49] rates in particular discount rates and
[36:52] time preferences are a function of how
[36:53] uncertain your environment is so if you
[36:55] have a highly uncertain environment M
[36:58] you you're not looking far forward and
[37:01] you're also not using much of the
[37:03] information from like the more distant
[37:05] past and think of ultimately like life
[37:08] during wartime you know your your time
[37:11] there's a this um the telescoping of
[37:13] time is one way that it's been described
[37:15] so as your uncertainty in the world goes
[37:18] up your time uh your your telescope or
[37:22] your the range of uh the past and the
[37:24] future that you consider actually falls
[37:26] down so in Wartime that can be down to
[37:28] hours or days and if you have high
[37:32] discount rates which are not necessarily
[37:35] they're not reflected in Market interest
[37:37] rates but you know there will I don't
[37:40] like over the long term it doesn't seem
[37:42] that they can diverge over a very long
[37:44] term but if you have a lot of
[37:46] uncertainty that implies High diff uh
[37:49] discount rates and if you have much more
[37:52] economic certainty which is part of the
[37:54] Bitcoin argument that you have a much
[37:55] longer time Horizon uh that implies
[37:58] lower discount rates but you know for a
[38:01] government to come in like the Trump
[38:03] Administration last last uh last term
[38:06] seemed to just thrive on chaos and you
[38:09] know we look at what's going to be
[38:10] happening as far as Government
[38:12] efficiency there's going to be a lot of
[38:13] changes coming in the US that have
[38:15] important International implications and
[38:18] to me high uncertain we also have
[38:20] technological change that's just
[38:22] Galloping along right now um and so
[38:26] there's all this un certainty and that
[38:29] doesn't you know that implies high high
[38:32] discount rates it doesn't imply low
[38:34] discount rates so there's this whole
[38:36] sphere out there and this is an area
[38:37] again academic research could probably
[38:40] there's a lot of academic Minds that
[38:41] could probably really help thinking this
[38:43] out over the longer term how these
[38:45] Dynamics interact what's the interaction
[38:47] between Bitcoins you know pushing out
[38:50] the time harizon and lowering the
[38:52] discount rate versus technological
[38:54] Advance pulling the the uncertainty or
[38:57] increasing the uncertainty and pulling
[38:59] the discount rates uh the other
[39:01] direction so you know it's just a huge
[39:05] uh huge number of challenges in the area
[39:07] so I think this could keep economists
[39:08] going for you know the next decade
[39:10] probably in different research projects
[39:12] to try to figure out what exactly the
[39:14] relationships are I don't think it's as
[39:16] simple as what uh we often think about
[39:19] in much of the uh in much of the Bitcoin
[39:21] space absolutely um what also is
[39:25] interesting for me um we had a really
[39:28] quick development in the last four years
[39:30] of Bitcoin adoption in corporations uh
[39:34] micro strategy basically kicked it off
[39:36] in 2020 with the first public Trad
[39:38] company now it gets more and more
[39:40] popular we see like meta plan s
[39:43] scientific and like hundreds of other uh
[39:46] great publicly Trader companies uh that
[39:48] that do that strategy more or less uh
[39:52] and especially in the private sector
[39:53] also more um and now we might see 2025
[39:59] the real kickoff of like nation state uh
[40:03] adoption um where yeah Denis Porter
[40:06] makes makes great oh wait uh now is I
[40:08] think a good time to to show this
[40:10] quickly because we talked about Sosi
[40:12] action and and about Dennis Porter I
[40:15] just want to show this to people if
[40:16] they're interested in in the other side
[40:19] of also satosi action uh we talked about
[40:23] uh actually with Dennis Porter not that
[40:24] long ago two months ago about uh the
[40:27] whole thing also on on on his side it's
[40:29] super interesting and maybe it might be
[40:30] an interesting uh yeah combination to to
[40:33] that podcast also but how what will
[40:35] change when more and more corporations
[40:37] more and more individuals and more and
[40:39] more nation states also adopt now
[40:42] Bitcoin as a a primary Reserve asset on
[40:45] on the balance sheet what impact do you
[40:46] think will will that have yeah well you
[40:49] you I think you were maybe on the spaces
[40:51] where we were talking about the price
[40:53] forecasting paper that uh and model that
[40:55] I did which is how you connected
[40:58] originally and my like my interest on
[41:03] the adoption side is uh how that impacts
[41:08] the how the supply and demand Dynamics
[41:10] impact the price projections going
[41:13] forward and so that's really what I'm
[41:15] trying to figure out and trying to
[41:17] figure out what exactly and when there
[41:20] might be a supply Crunch and U or a
[41:23] supply shot coming down the road and
[41:26] more Broad
[41:27] and this is something I haven't I've
[41:30] sketched out but I haven't worked on
[41:32] what happens if there is like a really
[41:34] hyperbolic price increase in Bitcoin and
[41:36] what does that imply for society I think
[41:38] there's like there's there's some
[41:42] really I don't think the implications
[41:45] are are thought out right now at all and
[41:49] there are some positive scenarios but
[41:51] there's also some very negative
[41:52] scenarios I think that are possible so
[41:54] that's something that I'm just starting
[41:56] to uh work on right now and it probably
[41:59] won't that it'll be like a part-time
[42:01] project that I keep on maybe over the
[42:03] balance of this year uh but I would
[42:06] really like to figure out first of all
[42:08] what are the what are the probabilities
[42:13] for like really really substantial P
[42:16] price
[42:17] increases and um uh during a supply
[42:20] shock and what are the social and
[42:22] economic and governance implications of
[42:25] those uh down the road
[42:27] that's super interesting especially the
[42:30] question of like like first of all like
[42:32] I was really disappointed with the 100K
[42:36] reactions uh from outside of Bitcoin
[42:39] obviously within Bitcoin we celebrated
[42:41] there was like 100k parties over all
[42:44] over the all over the world uh there
[42:47] there was a lot of celebrations and and
[42:49] we like celebrated it but I thought
[42:51] actually that it will be less of a big
[42:53] deal within the Bitcoin community and
[42:56] more of a big deal outside of the
[42:58] Bitcoin Community I was totally
[43:00] wrong with that one because nobody
[43:03] really seem to care obviously some
[43:05] friends were like oh yeah you you're
[43:07] doing good now in Bitcoin right it hit
[43:09] 100K but it it's it didn't spark an
[43:12] interest in them and also if you see
[43:14] metrics like Google Trends I love to see
[43:17] Google Trends if you compare that to
[43:20] 2017 it was just like a small Spike
[43:22] we're like at 50% of the levels of of
[43:25] 2017 and we are now so much bigger yeah
[43:29] than 2017 it's it's crazy for me how how
[43:32] how that 100K didn't do anything more
[43:36] yeah and maybe it's just a like a
[43:38] reflection that retail isn't like the
[43:40] most important sector anymore like it
[43:42] used to be and like you were saying I
[43:44] mean there's so many corporations are
[43:46] adopting uh nation states probably
[43:48] already like stacking in probably more
[43:51] to come in state level uh you know for
[43:55] Dennis is certainly uh
[43:57] he's very certain that we're going to
[43:59] get at least one state that signs
[44:00] legislation in the next while um and
[44:04] like things are looking you know we're
[44:06] we're talking to numerous States right
[44:08] now there's efforts going on in in um
[44:11] well I don't know if I should say how
[44:12] many but like at least 10 I think that's
[44:15] been been what they've uh Dennis and uh
[44:18] Erica been saying publicly uh so we're
[44:21] seeing all this uh happening and yeah
[44:24] maybe maybe retail F maybe it won't hit
[44:26] till it's a mill ion you know uh who
[44:28] knows or you know 300 400,000 where we
[44:32] get like really up into these areas that
[44:34] it becomes like a really substantial
[44:35] impact where people that uh used to be
[44:37] able to uh have the opportunity to buy
[44:41] Bitcoin at you know $4,000 or $25,000 or
[44:45] $10,000 really look and really real
[44:48] realize what the opportunity cost of not
[44:51] inves in
[44:52] was absolutely I just want to show this
[44:55] to people uh because I wanted to see if
[44:56] it's it's actually 50% it's actually
[44:59] right around uh 46 uh% of what we had
[45:03] 2017 with this huge Bull Run uh and
[45:07] we're not even close to what we had in
[45:09] 2021 uh so this this tells me kind of
[45:12] like we the this uh Bull Run is kind of
[45:16] driven by uh uh corporations and by
[45:19] institutions and by ETFs and less by
[45:22] retail retail seems to be not as
[45:24] important and I talked with Roger son on
[45:26] that of like M that we think that even
[45:30] at like a million um most people will be
[45:34] still um let's say ignorant uh to to
[45:38] this asset and will still be like ah
[45:40] okay Bitcoin only slowly slow if the
[45:43] price goes to a million above that
[45:46] number where uh uh it really wakes
[45:50] people up and uh 90% And maybe 80% are
[45:54] still asleep to to bitcoin I mean
[45:57] depending on how what metrics you're
[45:59] looking at yeah and like a lot of people
[46:01] will probably be similar to what like
[46:03] you know my experience or probably your
[46:05] experience a lot of people in the bit
[46:06] coin space it takes like two or three
[46:08] takes on it to really like have it click
[46:12] and that didn't happen I I saw a Bitcoin
[46:14] back in 2010 uh like the Bitcoin faucet
[46:18] days where you could get five five free
[46:20] Bitcoin just for giving your address
[46:22] which I thought was an email address and
[46:24] I wasn't going to give out my my email
[46:26] address and get spam email so I passed
[46:28] on that uh but and then like
[46:33] 2015 uh I saw Bitcoin again came up uh
[46:38] I've one of my areas in academics was uh
[46:40] or and is still Horizon scanning so what
[46:43] are the new emerging issues and Bitcoin
[46:46] had actually been picked up as a
[46:47] positive in 2015 on um on a biodiversity
[46:51] Horizon scan and for for its ability to
[46:55] sop up uh waste energy unfortunately all
[46:58] the deis stuff and the Mora edl papers
[47:02] came out after but uh the first time it
[47:04] came to our radar in academics it was
[47:06] actually a positive and so I looked at
[47:09] it then and then I tried to
[47:12] buy um
[47:14] and what so one of the things I won't do
[47:17] is like I've traded a lot like I've been
[47:19] options trading like since forever uh
[47:22] and uh like 35 years and um I won't
[47:26] Chase prices I'm pretty disciplined on
[47:28] on um Investments and so I'll I won't
[47:31] Chase prices and I'll sell if I get to a
[47:34] certain if I hit a certain price level
[47:36] on the way down and um so I wouldn't
[47:40] Chase like I personally I watched
[47:42] Bitcoin go through the 2 what was it
[47:45] 2017 2018 whatever the bull run in that
[47:49] time range and I I wouldn't pay the
[47:51] price and then it fell back down it was
[47:53] down to $3,000 and I was looking at it I
[47:55] tried to open an account couldn't get an
[47:57] account opened I was going to have to do
[47:59] some sort of peer-to-peer transfer with
[48:01] somebody in St Petersburg Russia that
[48:03] wasn't going to happen and um I was
[48:05] living in uh Southern Sweden malma at
[48:07] that time so uh there's a Bitcoin uh uh
[48:11] ATM across the way in Copenhagen but
[48:13] they were charging like a 30% premium on
[48:16] um for buying through an ATM and I said
[48:19] like my Economist side com you know I'm
[48:21] not going to pay a 30% premium premium
[48:23] so I could have had Bitcoin for $3,900
[48:26] instead of3 00 uh or
[48:28] $3,000 and like that didn't happen so I
[48:31] didn't end up buying like actually
[48:33] buying Bitcoin until after the uh after
[48:36] it came down in price after the 20 the
[48:39] 2019 2020 price
[48:42] spike and you know if you think of that
[48:45] other people might like sort of have
[48:48] that similar maybe maybe they'll be
[48:50] smarter and have like an Accel they'll
[48:51] be able to compress their time scale of
[48:54] um it wasn't skepticism for me it was
[48:56] just indifference or just not
[48:59] understanding it but I think you know if
[49:01] we look out into the retail world you
[49:03] know there's probably a lot of people
[49:05] that like it's the same sort of thing
[49:06] they maybe have to encounter it like
[49:08] multiple times and they somehow has to
[49:11] be validated through friends or through
[49:13] family or through investment advis
[49:15] advisors that this is actually a
[49:16] legitimate thing and on the investment
[49:18] advisor side I mean that's just starting
[49:21] now um you know you have a lot of
[49:23] Bitcoin meetups that are starting but
[49:25] you're only covering in just a tiny tiny
[49:28] fraction of of the people out there and
[49:30] I just you know I just think it's going
[49:32] to take time for
[49:34] people yeah and it's it it definitely is
[49:37] accelerating I had uh already one person
[49:41] on not that many but one person on that
[49:44] it was orange B in
[49:45] 2024 uh so fairly recently uh and I saw
[49:50] that she was just in Bitcoin for around
[49:52] five months and she was so far down the
[49:54] rabbit hole and I was like wow that's
[49:56] really and that got me into thinking of
[49:58] like okay you just described of how you
[50:01] had to open account and then it was not
[50:03] possible then you had to do p detection
[50:06] now in a small country with like 8
[50:08] million people in Austria or know let's
[50:11] say the German speaking area Austria
[50:13] Germany and swiss there are five Bitcoin
[50:18] only
[50:19] exchanges yeah only here only in the
[50:22] German speaking area that I know of uh
[50:25] they make it super easy advertise for it
[50:27] they give you uh really easy to use uh
[50:31] uh applications that super are super
[50:34] integrated with the traditional banking
[50:36] apps here uh then there's an vast
[50:39] majority a vast landscape of Bitcoin
[50:42] content creators podcast hosts speakers
[50:45] conferences all those things they were
[50:47] those were not there 2017 2015 and stuff
[50:51] like that so I feel like the the rails
[50:54] are there to have an onboard fast
[50:56] onboarding yeah yeah so maybe what like
[50:58] in my case it was like 10 years from
[51:01] like finding out about Bitcoin to
[51:02] purchasing a lot of people like it was
[51:04] maybe three years or two years at that
[51:06] time you know they might have
[51:07] encountered it a few times and then like
[51:09] sort of clued into it a little bit
[51:11] earlier and rode the you know some of
[51:13] those early bull markets up and back
[51:15] down again yeah and it's easier and
[51:17] certainly here in Canada like it's much
[51:18] easier to uh uh access Bitcoin again the
[51:22] I mean we H we have ATMs I was just out
[51:24] for a walk yesterday in the small town I
[51:26] live in I saw a Bitcoin ATM that I
[51:28] hadn't seen before and they're a bit
[51:30] more pricey than before uh uh than
[51:33] buying buying out a exchange but you
[51:36] know that's a possibility and we have
[51:38] some really good exchanges now in Canada
[51:40] Bitcoin uh only exchanges as well so
[51:43] that's good I know of uh Bitcoin bull I
[51:46] know from Canada and they recently also
[51:49] started in Europe as far as I know I'm
[51:52] not sure about that but yeah I think
[51:53] they started also here but yeah really
[51:55] cool um
[51:57] I think you said you're only in the
[51:59] beginning of your research but what did
[52:00] you find out so far like what happens
[52:03] once we hit those uh uh price targets of
[52:07] like 500,000 a million 10 million yeah
[52:10] well I I think that sort of the main
[52:13] message I got a bit of grief from some
[52:14] of the power law people uh because I I
[52:17] made a comment in the working paper that
[52:20] um I view power laws as descriptive not
[52:23] as predictive and that sort of raised
[52:25] the ey you probably get some comments
[52:27] now that I said that again um but the
[52:30] reason I say that is you know being an
[52:33] economist and being a micro particularly
[52:35] applied microeconomist I'm always about
[52:37] supply and demand I came from the
[52:39] agricultural field so you know it's
[52:41] everything's about supply and
[52:42] demand and
[52:46] um you know I figure we we don't know
[52:49] exactly where we are for liquid supply
[52:51] for Bitcoin because we have uh Bitcoin
[52:53] on exchanges we have uh otz Dash and
[52:56] plus we have like a lot of Bitcoin
[52:58] holders a lot of people are assuming you
[53:00] know it could be a lot of Bitcoin from
[53:02] the early holders is lost I'm not myself
[53:06] I'm not so certain you've probably met
[53:08] people I've met people that you know I
[53:11] know I I met somebody randomly that was
[53:13] mining Bitcoin when it was
[53:16] $1 excuse me and um you know uh that
[53:20] person you know they I don't know how
[53:23] much Bitcoin they have but when it was
[53:24] $1 I mean you could have thousands of
[53:26] Bitcoin and that's been sitting on hard
[53:28] drives in a like in a closet for the
[53:30] last like however many years that is now
[53:33] 15
[53:35] years and um I I suspect there might be
[53:39] more Bitcoin Supply that we assume is
[53:42] loss that might come back out into the
[53:45] into the uh trade once the play uh into
[53:48] trade once uh prices get high enough but
[53:51] at the same time we have the nation
[53:53] states we have States we have
[53:55] corporations that are buying Bitcoin and
[53:56] taking the supply off so to me the whole
[53:59] question about you know price
[54:01] trajectories is is really comes down in
[54:04] the next couple of years I think it's
[54:05] all demand side that's going to drive
[54:08] it and I don't think I
[54:11] don't excuse me
[54:14] again actually can we just break for a
[54:16] bit I better get a glass of water yeah
[54:18] yeah yeah yeah like can yeah yeah yeah
[54:21] yeah yeah yeah sorry about that I had uh
[54:23] coffee handy but I had no water you're
[54:25] muted oh
[54:27] sorry uh I was just saying I always have
[54:29] water next to me uh because I have
[54:33] usually uh two sometimes three podcast
[54:37] recordings per day either my podcast
[54:39] other shows guest repents and stuff like
[54:41] that yeah and I just like need it for my
[54:45] throat otherwi my throat is dying off
[54:47] your work you must have your workflow
[54:49] just nailed by
[54:50] now yes I I definitely have my you are
[54:54] my 368 podcast
[54:57] guest and it will be fun to see how how
[55:01] it looks once I cross like a thousand
[55:03] podcast guests and stuff like that
[55:04] because I came now so quick in just a
[55:07] year to over over 300 and I will come
[55:10] this year this year will probably cross
[55:14] over 700 yeah I will cross this year
[55:17] already over 700 so uh 2096 I will cross
[55:21] the Thousand guests will be fun to see
[55:24] yeah we didn't we didn't talk about it
[55:26] but like like one of the things I'm
[55:27] doing on my own is um uh summarizing
[55:30] YouTube um uh podcasts and that's part
[55:33] of my Horizon scanning for for uh uh for
[55:37] um um Bitcoin so basically going through
[55:40] every podcast and pulling out potential
[55:42] research questions and then prioritizing
[55:44] them and I've got my workflow down to I
[55:47] can summarize like a YouTube video now
[55:49] and about 10 minutes so it's like yeah
[55:53] it's like the technology coming along is
[55:55] just so good but anyway that's yeah that
[55:58] it goes so quick now I used to need
[56:01] around 2 hours to prepare for guest
[56:04] obviously that's not working now because
[56:05] I do every day uh I need now between 10
[56:09] and 20 minutes uh with all the AI tools
[56:13] uh that I have in place and I just have
[56:15] gi the name in there and they're giving
[56:17] me already a lot uh then just some some
[56:20] manual work in there and it's just so
[56:22] quick and it's better than when I used
[56:24] to spend two hours more information is
[56:27] in there and they give it me in in a
[56:29] better formed way on one cl it's it's
[56:32] amazing yeah yeah I I just upgraded to
[56:34] uh the um open AI uh 01 uh uh and 01 Pro
[56:40] uh model that $200 a month model and
[56:42] it's that like now my content is coming
[56:45] through I do light edits for style and
[56:49] um I've been doing briefing notes on a
[56:51] lot of the podcasts as well um although
[56:53] I've been a bit behind on that just
[56:54] because things have been so busy withi
[56:56] action but yeah it's like the the
[56:58] process 01 is I find so good uh that
[57:02] it's got my writing style and it's got
[57:05] my um and it gets the content it just
[57:07] Nails content every time uh it's just
[57:10] ton of really rare that I have to even
[57:12] addit anything anymore I just see it now
[57:15] I I've never seen that
[57:17] before how long are they having that on
[57:20] already because I'm a big Jet gbd fan uh
[57:24] like I use it for so much of my work and
[57:26] I just see it for the first time ever
[57:28] that they even do that oh1 uh yeah it's
[57:31] been about a I've I'm just coming up on
[57:34] my first full month with it and uh yeah
[57:37] it's it's just it's super like for me I
[57:39] thought $200 that's a lot of money I
[57:41] know price will come down over time um
[57:45] but it just like it just just as an
[57:49] example so last year YouTube uh videos I
[57:53] have 18 over 1,800 uh is summarized from
[57:57] last uh from 2024 calendar year another
[58:01] 1,600 plus from
[58:03] 2023 and I used the open AI uh 01 Pro um
[58:09] which is uh slow but I asked it to
[58:12] organize all the all the so every
[58:15] podcast 20 20 research questions and
[58:18] then five high priorities so 1800 times
[58:20] 5 questions I asked uh open AI uh 01 Pro
[58:24] to organize that and to make sure that
[58:27] every every research need that it
[58:30] identified was uh distinct and to
[58:33] Cluster all of these together re remove
[58:36] ID uh redundancies and it was super
[58:39] interesting because you know how chat
[58:40] gbt it's like all it's it's function to
[58:44] like it's designed to work with people
[58:46] and you know you're saying your thank
[58:47] yous and it's like giving you banter
[58:50] type stuff 01 Pro was the first time
[58:54] that I thought holy this is machine
[58:55] learning
[58:56] like it would it took this massive data
[58:59] set and just cranked through it and it
[59:01] spat out like this organization that was
[59:04] just perfect it would have taken me a
[59:05] year to do it like manually I've done
[59:08] I've done these studies before and it
[59:10] would have easily taken me a full year
[59:12] to work through what it did in 20
[59:14] minutes oh yeah that's yeah it it
[59:17] fascinates me how quick it is also
[59:19] finding its way in my life like uh I
[59:24] don't I rarely Google any more uh if I
[59:27] have a question like for example if I if
[59:29] I'm cooking something and I'm like like
[59:32] how can I do it or like or I messed
[59:34] something up with the some better way to
[59:36] do it I just open jbd with the voice
[59:38] mode I'm like hey jbd and then I'm
[59:40] chatting with it oh that and that you
[59:42] can do uh or emails I I I I do now I
[59:48] would say 80% of my emails with cgbd
[59:50] it's so good it got my writing style
[59:52] down uh and I'm like like that's that's
[59:56] me like I would write that email like
[59:58] that and in like a in like 10 seconds it
[60:02] has that email and I put a um a prompt
[60:06] in for like 30 seconds and then I copy
[60:08] it and probably need like for the whole
[60:10] thing one minute otherwise I would need
[60:12] like oh like how okay then I have to
[60:15] approve it and stuff like that that
[60:16] that's that's amazing yeah yeah
[60:18] productivity is just like through the
[60:20] roof like it's just like I you know for
[60:22] me this is like as a university
[60:25] Professor a lot of times you have a like
[60:26] a a group of PhD students that are
[60:28] working with you and you know you'll put
[60:30] out like projects then they'll get them
[60:33] working on projects together and but oh
[60:35] my God like working with gbt it's like
[60:37] it's like it's like the best editor that
[60:40] I've ever worked with and it's like all
[60:44] for me like 24 hours a day and it's like
[60:47] I it's just amazing like I just the
[60:49] productivity level if if I was still
[60:51] working in academics I typically would
[60:54] have published like six papers per year
[60:57] uh with various co-authors and now I
[61:00] could easily see if I had a full group
[61:02] of phds and a postto or two I mean we'd
[61:05] be cranking out like 30 papers a year
[61:08] probably it's the same with the podcast
[61:10] I couldn't do this
[61:12] podcast uh as I do it right now without
[61:16] AI because I need the AI to do the post
[61:18] production because especially have like
[61:20] a trailer in front of like I have clips
[61:22] and stuff like that in that quality I
[61:24] couldn't do the podcast in that quality
[61:26] and quantity with thei not even close um
[61:30] now I'm getting to my my first employee
[61:32] so now let's see what's what's possible
[61:34] but uh till now it was possible just
[61:37] with the AI employee that that that I
[61:40] had but uh coming back
[61:43] to to bitcoin I think you were talking
[61:46] about the the the paper the research
[61:48] that you currently doing yeah yeah uh so
[61:52] um yeah the supply shock side we were
[61:54] talking about um so my my question so
[61:58] the over the next few years I see demand
[62:00] uh is really uh driving uh bitcoin price
[62:04] increases and I think that could be
[62:06] really substantial uh like I mean uh if
[62:09] we get up to market cap of gold um we've
[62:12] I've heard various people talking to
[62:14] $800,000 range and I was I personally I
[62:18] was skeptical of that but then when I
[62:20] did the economic modeling I came up with
[62:22] that $813,000 price for like a uh for
[62:26] the gold market cap if Bitcoin got up to
[62:28] that so the modeling actually helped me
[62:32] be less skeptical about the price
[62:34] increases um on the supply side though
[62:38] the big question
[62:39] is is Supply taken off uh out of the
[62:44] market permanently and uh for a lot of
[62:47] the reserves I mean the state reserves
[62:49] you're talking about sometimes 10
[62:51] sometimes 20 year time Horizons before
[62:53] they're even allowed to sell it I don't
[62:55] know what will happen with the national
[62:56] Reserve if the US goes ahead with that
[62:59] and what the implications there are
[63:01] corporates I mean you know Michael
[63:02] sailor's talking about permanently
[63:04] holding those and as we go into a world
[63:07] where we can um take loans out against
[63:10] Bitcoin uh where there's derivative
[63:12] products that maybe we can use to
[63:14] generate income like selling covered
[63:16] calls like or different types of option
[63:18] strategies where we don't need to sell a
[63:21] Bitcoin my my feeling is that we're
[63:24] going to see a lot of Bitcoin that
[63:25] doesn't move that will actually get to
[63:26] supply shock and so what the economic
[63:29] model um did was it
[63:33] really gives a first estimate of where
[63:36] that Supply shock comes and I don't see
[63:38] it really fully kicking in until we get
[63:40] down to a 1 million Bitcoin liquid
[63:43] Supply and even with some large scale
[63:46] institutional buying I personally I
[63:48] don't see that for like another two or
[63:51] three years but when it hits it's going
[63:53] to that's when back to what I had said
[63:55] about the power law being descriptive
[63:57] rather than predictive like I like to
[64:00] the way I like to think about things is
[64:01] okay what combinations of supply and
[64:04] demand would lead to a power law uh
[64:08] price trajectory and to me that's all
[64:11] based on the demand side so it's
[64:12] expanding demand and as it you know we
[64:15] go through the typical scurve for uh
[64:17] technological innovations adoption and
[64:21] that would that typically would lead to
[64:23] like a power law relationship and
[64:26] and when I look at it though when we
[64:28] take account of the supply shock uh side
[64:31] of things if we hit Supply shock and if
[64:34] uh depending on how many ogs come come
[64:36] up with extra Bitcoin out of their
[64:38] closet hard drives and you know from
[64:40] wherever you know some of that will come
[64:42] back onto the market maybe that will
[64:44] slow down the supply shock but if we hit
[64:46] Supply shock the price is going to go
[64:48] astronomical like it's just going to
[64:50] like it will go like 5 million or 10
[64:53] million or more than that um before
[64:55] before it uh even starts to slow down
[64:57] and I don't know you know I don't
[65:00] understand the derivatives Market you've
[65:02] had other guests that really understand
[65:03] derivatives like really thoroughly and I
[65:06] think part of the the future is we
[65:09] actually want a future where bitcoin's
[65:11] price I think my view is that we want a
[65:14] a future where bitcoin's price can be
[65:17] controlled that it doesn't go up like in
[65:18] a straight hyperbolic you know just out
[65:21] out to the uh out to the moon and Beyond
[65:24] uh just because of some of the social
[65:26] impacts it could have
[65:28] and maybe the derivatives maybe a really
[65:31] robust you know uh a derivative Market
[65:34] can help you know sort of curtail that
[65:37] upper end of it and maybe at sometime
[65:41] the reserves will also be able to
[65:43] strategically sell off you know small
[65:45] portions or maybe there's opportunities
[65:48] for international cooperation to form an
[65:50] international strategic Reserve where if
[65:53] prices really start to go you know fully
[65:55] bistic that you know there will be some
[65:57] sort of bleed out of existing Supply uh
[66:00] back into the liquid market so I don't
[66:02] know how any of that's going to be
[66:03] handle I don't know if people are really
[66:05] thinking about that or who's thinking
[66:06] about that right now right now the focus
[66:09] just seems to be on price going up how
[66:12] high has it has the Bitcoin price to go
[66:15] for it to really have negative impacts
[66:18] on on society well I don't you know I
[66:21] mean I the way that I've started to
[66:23] think about this is like I've tried to
[66:25] think but well what axis could you you
[66:28] know describe Bitcoin on globally and so
[66:30] you could have a world in which there's
[66:32] you know mainly institutional adoption
[66:34] versus mainly Regional or U sorry uh
[66:37] retail retail and Regional so there's a
[66:39] global global versus regional world
[66:43] there's a a world that's in Conflict
[66:45] where there's a world that's relatively
[66:46] stable and there's a bunch of these
[66:48] different axes there maybe five or six
[66:49] of them that are major axis and you know
[66:52] one of again going back to research
[66:54] world one of the things that is done in
[66:57] uh safer climate change policy there's
[66:59] all these scenarios that are have been
[67:01] built out and so they have
[67:03] representative scenarios that are used
[67:04] in all their modeling uh and so you can
[67:07] go in and specify each of these
[67:09] scenarios has a number you can go in and
[67:10] specify the scenario that you're using
[67:13] for your modeling and then you can look
[67:15] and see what like what happens to
[67:17] climate change under dirt certain uh
[67:20] assumptions about fossil fuel use over
[67:22] time just as an example now in the
[67:24] Bitcoin world I could could see
[67:25] something similar happening where we
[67:27] have sort of a a baseline scenario that
[67:30] you know we have some sort of certain
[67:31] price traj trajectory uh and we make
[67:34] assumptions and then we we make
[67:36] assumptions about what these other is
[67:39] Bitcoin going to be globally adopted is
[67:40] it going to be regionally adopted is it
[67:42] going to be uh primarily an
[67:44] Institutional game or a mix of
[67:47] institutional retail is there a strong
[67:49] derivatives Market is there uh
[67:52] relatively you know it's more sort of
[67:54] your um exchange traded uh uh products
[67:59] and maybe coins on Exchange and
[68:01] different sorts of things that where you
[68:03] don't get that depth of the derivatives
[68:05] market and I think if you combine you
[68:07] know so you combine you say okay what
[68:09] happens if we have a a scenario where
[68:11] it's Global but there's like high level
[68:14] of conflict and it's institutional and
[68:17] there's a lot of derivatives uh trading
[68:20] maybe it will be
[68:21] stable but what happens if we have like
[68:24] conflict then geopolitically there's
[68:27] like you know it's quite divided that
[68:29] might be another scenario so this is a
[68:32] very poor explanation but the way I'm
[68:34] starting to try to think about this is
[68:36] like so what are what potential what
[68:38] what are the potential Bitcoin worlds
[68:40] that we could land in uh based
[68:43] on these different these different
[68:46] trajectories and I think that there's
[68:49] all sorts of trajectories that where it
[68:51] ends up where Bitcoin ends up being like
[68:54] a a sort of strategically hoarded either
[68:56] at the international like at the nation
[68:58] state level or even at the regional
[69:00] level where it becomes sort of a refuge
[69:02] for Elites and oh the centralization
[69:05] versus decentralization is another
[69:07] important AIS because you know does the
[69:09] original Bitcoin ethos hold or does it
[69:12] become completely financialized and
[69:15] really uh is a centralized game for
[69:17] institutions so there's there's all
[69:20] these different aspects that need
[69:21] thinking and in consideration uh but
[69:25] that's something that I'm just like just
[69:27] just starting to do right now and I
[69:29] don't know if other people are also
[69:31] thinking along the same lines or not I
[69:34] love that yeah I definitely want to like
[69:35] if you maybe like one in one year
[69:37] further down down the road uh we could
[69:41] do a second uh podcast I think that's
[69:43] that's super interesting like I'm just
[69:46] sitting here and like being so impressed
[69:48] with like your thoughts and and where
[69:50] where you're going with that because
[69:51] it's I think it's really interesting to
[69:53] to to listen to and I definitely want to
[69:56] do a second round on that yeah yeah that
[69:59] would be that would be great uh the
[70:01] other thing that I think that people
[70:03] don't understand is and you know you you
[70:05] get a lot of the mathematicians that are
[70:07] in the space will also say this is that
[70:10] you know people humans don't understand
[70:13] exponential or hyperbolic growth or
[70:15] decline and um for anyone that watched
[70:18] real time so I during my trading days I
[70:21] had I dabbled run with the coins as
[70:23] well I went completely Bitcoin after the
[70:25] Luna crash but I watched the Luna crash
[70:27] in real time and uh over the space of I
[70:32] I did a screenshot of it and it was like
[70:34] over the space of two days it lost 13
[70:38] million per in
[70:39] value and like that was that that was
[70:43] the only time I've ever seen anything
[70:46] like exhibit X well in that case it was
[70:48] logarithmic it was uh because it was on
[70:50] the decline but it's the the logarithmic
[70:53] death of Luna was just like like it was
[70:57] just like un you you would see go like
[71:00] if you were looking at one minute
[71:02] candles it was going up and down like
[71:04] 100% in one minute candles it was just
[71:06] complete chaos and
[71:09] um and that like that's something that
[71:12] nobody like nobody nobody can fathom I
[71:15] don't think our human brains can like we
[71:16] can fathom it mathematically but I don't
[71:18] think experientially we really
[71:21] understand and I think like looking to
[71:23] people like Samson ma that you know talk
[71:26] about the you know this you know the
[71:28] huge candle to the upside um you know I
[71:32] I think it's in the realm a possibility
[71:34] and so when I look you know the price
[71:36] modeling that I'm doing right now my my
[71:38] broad findings are demand drives price
[71:40] over the next few years Supply drives
[71:43] price after that that's how I would
[71:45] summarize my modeling and if the
[71:47] modeling is wrong well so be it I'm I'm
[71:49] quite happy with that um but if we get
[71:52] into Supply shock territory I think we
[71:54] definitely see we see price moves both
[71:57] up and down uh that just dwarf anything
[72:00] that we've seen before I one of the one
[72:03] of the things that a lot of the power
[72:05] law people will say is that we should
[72:07] expect diminishing returns and sort of
[72:09] increased stabilization now maybe the
[72:11] derivatives Market helped give us uh
[72:14] stabilization over time but from an
[72:16] economics uh perspective and in this in
[72:19] the working paper that we have out uh
[72:22] right now Bitcoin has a vertical Supply
[72:25] uh curve and it's coming up and
[72:27] intersecting this demand curve that's
[72:28] really in the steepest part of the curve
[72:30] to me from an economic first principles
[72:33] perspective what that says is that we're
[72:35] going into as Supply becomes more scarce
[72:38] we're increasingly going into a more
[72:41] volatile uh region of like price
[72:44] discovery not a less Vol volatile one so
[72:47] right now I just I I personally I don't
[72:50] believe that we're going into di uh like
[72:52] a era of diminishing returns and more
[72:54] price stability I think we're going to
[72:55] go the other
[72:57] direction I think I I think so too I I
[73:01] have a hard time believing that
[73:03] diminishing returns are real yeah I I
[73:06] can see a Godzilla candle how or
[73:09] something like that a god candle how Sam
[73:12] I will have him on uh very soon the
[73:14] first time on my channel I think like in
[73:16] a month or something like that will be
[73:17] fun to talk with him about that I think
[73:19] he's the the hyperb of the hyper balls
[73:23] well it seems like everybody tries to do
[73:25] out to each other
[73:26] though yeah that's
[73:30] true uh what are your uh price price
[73:34] predictions uh I I would say I I don't
[73:38] do price predictions per se
[73:41] but what I like I think of everything in
[73:43] terms of expected value and I think that
[73:47] absolutely if you're looking on a three
[73:49] to 5e time Horizon say that your
[73:52] expected value should be including 5 and
[73:54] 10 million dollar options for Bitcoin
[73:57] and wow I would put like say you put
[74:00] like um half percent or 1% on a 10
[74:03] million Val value that adds a lot to
[74:05] your EV uh same with five million I mean
[74:08] Greg fos went on about this for years
[74:10] with this uh for a 2 million price uh
[74:14] prediction you know even if it was a low
[74:16] probability so I think for for me the
[74:18] the proper way to think about it is you
[74:21] know for a for an investor uh to think
[74:24] about well what are the probabilities is
[74:26] there a probability of Bitcoin going to
[74:28] zero most people will say yes just to be
[74:30] polite like or you know just to okay
[74:33] anything's possible but you know is that
[74:36] like is there really a nonzero
[74:39] probability of going going to zero and I
[74:41] don't know if that's the case anymore I
[74:44] mean I could see you know maybe calling
[74:47] a be case maybe you put a probability in
[74:49] 50,000 100,000 you know 250 500 a
[74:52] million 5 million 10 million and sort of
[74:55] divide up your personal probabilities
[74:57] one of the things with expected value is
[74:59] it's a personal thing too because per uh
[75:01] expected value is all about risk
[75:03] perceptions and everybody has different
[75:05] risk perceptions based on their
[75:06] information and their beliefs
[75:10] and yeah all I'll say is that personally
[75:13] I would be look if I think in terms of
[75:15] in uh expected values I'm definitely
[75:19] factoring in $5 million uh right
[75:22] now I would put just is a ballpark I
[75:26] haven't done it formally for myself but
[75:27] I would sort of think maybe I if I was
[75:30] giving doing an allocation I'd say maybe
[75:33] 5% like to 5 million 15% to a million or
[75:37] something like that so 20% to a million
[75:39] or above and so yeah that bumps up the
[75:43] expected value
[75:45] calculation yeah and it's also
[75:47] interesting to think about like what is
[75:49] more uh
[75:51] likely $10 million price or like a Zer
[75:54] dollar
[75:55] oh I knowed the argument I'm on on that
[75:58] one it's like like oh
[76:01] like could could it go to zero like no
[76:04] like it really hard there has to be some
[76:07] huge Black Swan that nobody knows of
[76:10] like an alien civilization coming down
[76:12] and have better money or something like
[76:14] that yeah yeah I think to go to zero I
[76:16] mean society would be pretty much
[76:18] obliterated anyway so um One Way or
[76:22] Another and even if it was like
[76:26] well I mean no seriously I mean if
[76:27] Bitcoin goes to zero what like why like
[76:30] what what are you know why would that
[76:32] that be and again you know I I if I
[76:35] think of it this is totally off the top
[76:36] of my head but you know I'm an economist
[76:39] I think of the world in terms of supply
[76:40] and demand what does that imply there's
[76:43] zero demand for Bitcoin even if the
[76:45] world like you know even if there was a
[76:47] nuclear conflict there's going to be
[76:48] demand for Bitcoin I don't see it going
[76:50] to zero and uh the supply what happens
[76:54] with satos coins like somehow you know
[76:57] Satoshi was alive and decided to sell
[76:59] all his Bitcoin at some time you know
[77:02] that's a that's still a finite Supply um
[77:05] you know it would have a tremendous
[77:07] impact on the demand side as well but
[77:09] that would be a temporary shock so I
[77:11] don't see that putting uh coins down
[77:13] Bitcoin down to zero either yeah even
[77:15] like Sous coins moving I think that
[77:17] would be actually a positive thing long
[77:19] term short and medium-term could could
[77:22] go crash the Bitcoin price quite well
[77:24] and maybe adoption but it's kind of like
[77:26] this thing of where people are still
[77:28] like oh what if the Sosi move coin uh if
[77:32] the satoshi's coins move and once we get
[77:35] it out of the way because it Bitcoin
[77:37] will survive this um then it's like no
[77:41] no longer an argument and so like I
[77:43] think it would make Bitcoin longterm
[77:44] even stronger if those uh coins finally
[77:48] move but I actually think the the key to
[77:50] those coins is thrown away uh whoever
[77:53] Satoshi is I think uh th those are
[77:55] probably and that's just speculation
[77:57] from my side probably never move yeah
[78:01] well I guess unless the whole Quantum
[78:03] Computing thing unless they became
[78:04] vulnerable at some time in the future
[78:06] for that but I mean that's pretty spe
[78:09] that's true
[78:10] yeah but yeah uh then uh really cool uh
[78:14] unfortunately coming to the close it was
[78:17] really interesting podcast episode today
[78:20] um I've a question that I asked each and
[78:22] every one of my guests and the question
[78:23] is what can we learn from you besides
[78:26] Bitcoin besides Bitcoin oh man well
[78:30] um I guess one thing would be I
[78:33] discovered that sort of philosophically
[78:35] I'm a Buddhist and so um that was
[78:38] through trip to tibat like in
[78:41] 2010 and one of the things that I
[78:43] learned there that I think is really
[78:45] important is that um you know striving
[78:51] in like it's yeah everybody has aspir
[78:55] and whether this is bitcoin price
[78:57] aspirations or wealth aspirations and uh
[79:00] one of the things that that I I Learned
[79:02] was that uh you know you should really
[79:05] may maybe try to relinquish what your
[79:07] aspirations are a lot of times and uh
[79:10] and uh that helps to focus more in the
[79:12] moment although that's like a super uh
[79:15] High Time preference like focusing in
[79:17] the moment moment I haven't reconciled
[79:19] those two views uh totally yet uh
[79:21] because um um you know Focus only in the
[79:25] moment um is something that uh is in
[79:29] some ways a luxury but I think putting
[79:32] too much aspiration and thinking that
[79:34] somehow that you know if you hit a goal
[79:36] of having so much wealth or having a
[79:38] goal of so much Bitcoin hitting so so
[79:41] high of a price uh that that isn't
[79:45] necessarily going to make your life any
[79:47] better when it happens that you need to
[79:50] uh really focus on making your life
[79:51] better wherever you are whatever
[79:53] situation you're in and at the current
[79:55] moment that's very true and uh I I love
[79:59] it's like that being focused long term
[80:02] but being still present in the moment
[80:04] that that kind of like balance there I
[80:07] think that I think that's not
[80:10] necessarily speaks against each other
[80:13] like those can coincide with like being
[80:15] present in the moment focus on what's
[80:17] what's there and being happy here but
[80:19] still being like kind of focused on what
[80:22] what's going on for the longterm Vision
[80:24] yeah yeah yeah and uh like in that in
[80:26] that space there's this whole you know
[80:28] the idea that you you know
[80:30] attractiveness or attachment is the
[80:33] enemy but at the same time also aversion
[80:35] is the enemy so just as you shouldn't be
[80:38] like super attached to a point of view
[80:40] or perspective or to a thing uh you also
[80:44] shouldn't be you know uh uh aversive or
[80:48] you shouldn't uh like think negatively
[80:50] at things that uh um and maybe open
[80:53] yourself up to more experiences that way
[80:55] absolutely perfect then we have an in in
[80:58] the podcast where the previous guest is
[80:59] asking a question for the next guest
[81:01] without knowing who the next guest
[81:02] actually is and the question for you
[81:04] from the previous guest is how can we
[81:06] drive more Bitcoin adoption in Africa oh
[81:10] uh oh that's a perfect question actually
[81:13] um I think driving I mean there's so
[81:15] much going on in Africa right now I mean
[81:17] there's the the technical development um
[81:21] but I having worked on the landfill uh
[81:23] mining space before uh in the North
[81:26] American study I would love to see how
[81:30] more renewable energy and waste energy
[81:33] use in uh Africa can really facilitate
[81:37] the rural
[81:38] electrification uh um initiatives that
[81:41] are going on there and really expand
[81:43] that one of the when I was doing the uh
[81:46] the paper write up uh the for the uh
[81:49] nodal study for the our landfill study
[81:52] um I had to look around through a lot of
[81:54] the International literature about you
[81:56] know what sort of waste was available in
[81:58] Africa and the even the urban landfills
[82:01] have this tremendous amount of urban uh
[82:04] like waste energy available and I don't
[82:06] remember the numbers off off hand but I
[82:09] think like something like the the
[82:10] landfills in Africa could basically
[82:12] power the the Bitcoin network if I
[82:14] remember
[82:15] correctly grain of salt on that uh I'd
[82:18] have to look back at the exact figures
[82:19] but it's huge amounts of energy that are
[82:22] being wasted right now that could go to
[82:24] towards Economic Development and
[82:26] contribute uh greatly that way
[82:29] absolutely and empowerment for for afan
[82:32] people it's it's it's massive what B can
