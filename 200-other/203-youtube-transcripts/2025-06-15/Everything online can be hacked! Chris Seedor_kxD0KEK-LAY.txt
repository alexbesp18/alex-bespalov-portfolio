[00:00] privacy is not a right it is a
[00:03] obligation you have to enforce it
[00:05] yourself everything that is online can
[00:07] be hacked can be accessed from remotely
[00:09] from some guy in North Korea and uh
[00:11] money gone even if they have good
[00:13] arguments why they need that data they
[00:15] store it piss poor and eventually they
[00:17] get hacked this happens countless times
[00:19] time and time again if we start a war
[00:21] there will be three people missing like
[00:23] me and Two Soldiers looking for
[00:26] me how do we keep our Bitcoin safe and
[00:29] why is it such a terrible idea to keep
[00:31] it on just paper or just somewhere
[00:34] online so online is definitely not the
[00:37] way to go because everything that is
[00:39] online can be hacked can be accessed
[00:41] from remotely from some guy in North
[00:44] Korea and uh money gone um paper is
[00:48] fantastic it's a quick offline backup so
[00:51] I even like if you have like a phone
[00:52] wallet um I've seen many phone wallets
[00:55] that even allow you to uh copy paste the
[00:58] seat phrase out of there and even that
[01:00] to me is already uh stretching it uh
[01:03] because uh yeah the buffer the you don't
[01:06] want to save the seed words uh in the
[01:09] copy paste and the clipboard um write it
[01:11] down on paper you're good that's what I
[01:13] do for phone wallets if you have like a
[01:16] coal stack like a coal storage that's
[01:18] your life savings are stored on you can
[01:21] go the extra step then and go to a metal
[01:24] backup where you then also can rest
[01:26] assure if it's like left outside or if
[01:29] it's like in your house and there's a
[01:31] house fire that will survive because
[01:33] basically like the seed it's the only
[01:35] information that you have to have to
[01:37] recover everything it's also the only
[01:38] information that nobody uh but you
[01:42] unless you want to share it with your
[01:44] loved ones uh should know about and
[01:47] there's like a couple yeah Best
[01:49] Practices that should be
[01:52] observed yeah like because you said
[01:55] share with the LOF ones I think you also
[01:57] have like a company called ssk keeper
[01:59] where you have the inheres of Bitcoin
[02:03] saved uh this is some topic that I
[02:05] actually personally did not touch a lot
[02:08] because I'm I mean we're both really
[02:10] still young so obviously you you you you
[02:12] further ahead down that that rabbit hole
[02:15] but I did not uh do a lot of research on
[02:18] on that how
[02:20] [Laughter]
[02:24] just both very young people we don't we
[02:27] don't think about dying any minute now
[02:31] yes I mean that's it yeah but but you uh
[02:34] thought about that obviously uh like why
[02:37] did you do
[02:38] that and and what's the the solution for
[02:41] that so yeah the next logical step is if
[02:44] you have uh yeah generational wealth uh
[02:47] which we all expect to eventually have
[02:50] if you've stacked hard enough because
[02:51] it's the only scars asset and therefore
[02:54] wealth will accumulate if you have
[02:55] Bitcoin you think about passing it along
[02:58] and you have like kids you have
[03:00] uh your wife or or parents or whatever
[03:04] you want to take care of you don't want
[03:05] to take those Bitcoin into your into the
[03:07] grave uh as the German saying goes um
[03:10] that the last shirt doesn't have any
[03:12] Pockets or neither does it have wallets
[03:15] and then you have to have a way to
[03:17] communicate to your loved ones from the
[03:20] afterlife how to access it unless you
[03:23] have given them the secret beforehand
[03:25] and yeah with sets keeper it's a a uh
[03:29] company I have with with Joe from from
[03:32] bitbox and um there we give you a guided
[03:37] um backup solution where you just we
[03:40] never touch any of your keys you're not
[03:41] giving us any of the keys but you write
[03:44] down a will a testment that is then
[03:47] encrypted locally you can only create it
[03:50] entirely offline and then we offer that
[03:52] so that is free and then we offer um
[03:54] Proof of Life checks and we also um
[03:58] offer the option uh to to help your
[04:01] relatives recover um the the Bitcoin uh
[04:04] in in the event of your death uh again
[04:06] without ever touching Keys we just offer
[04:09] uh to walk them through those steps and
[04:11] we have the expertise to do that because
[04:14] the giving them the information is maybe
[04:16] the easy part having them recovered
[04:18] properly is not that trivial so yeah the
[04:22] best thing to do is uh in life uh talk
[04:25] to as many people as possible about
[04:27] Bitcoin and then uh teach them how to do
[04:30] and maybe give them I don't know what we
[04:32] have here like I have a seat signer here
[04:34] give them like a a stateless um signing
[04:37] device and have them practice this
[04:40] because we know how to do it and uh
[04:44] maybe you remember the first time you
[04:46] you like did it maybe with electrum or
[04:48] like a phone wallet uh this was entirely
[04:50] new and you didn't know how to do it
[04:52] properly and there there are some points
[04:54] where you can get stuck and yeah so how
[04:58] does this work how does this work with
[05:00] proof of life so proof of life there's
[05:03] different TI we can um send you an email
[05:06] every six months and if you don't
[05:08] respond next step we figure out whether
[05:10] there's like a death certificate in your
[05:12] name in your community um we can call
[05:16] you we can uh walk through these
[05:19] different steps that you can decide how
[05:21] um how much information you even want to
[05:22] give us because uh you can do this
[05:25] entirely anonymously and then just set
[05:28] up a payment in bit coin and then have
[05:30] us send you emails um but if you want
[05:33] then the option that we check a death
[05:35] certificate before we give out the
[05:37] encrypted file to uh you your
[05:39] predetermined air uh yeah then we will
[05:43] have to have your name but uh other than
[05:45] that um we try to have as little
[05:48] information as possible but as much as
[05:51] is necessary to recover the funds
[05:53] because if the Bitcoin are lost uh it's
[05:55] it's better for for all of us because
[05:57] then our Bitcoin uh in in value will
[06:00] will rise because uh I mean I don't know
[06:03] how many are lost already but uh yeah
[06:06] but basically as I understand it right
[06:08] you have an a crypted file and this file
[06:11] can be sent then to the relatives that
[06:14] uh is um right exactly so we have a tool
[06:18] you can you can download it and then you
[06:20] can only um is a guided process where we
[06:23] ask you the questions that you might
[06:25] miss if you make a backup and then where
[06:27] do you have Bitcoin stored where do you
[06:29] have
[06:30] uh your seat plates where do you have um
[06:33] which ex exchange are you registered
[06:34] where's the secret for the 2fa key stuff
[06:37] we we run you through the steps and then
[06:39] you encrypt it locally you give the
[06:40] password to encrypt it and that password
[06:43] you give to a relative or to an an air a
[06:46] safety person and then we can uh upload
[06:49] and store the uh encrypted file and uh
[06:53] only in the event of your death those
[06:55] two things will again uh yeah come back
[06:58] into context
[07:00] and then have the information where
[07:01] we'll find the backup so it's kind of a
[07:03] multi where uh the person with the
[07:06] relatives uh with the password plus your
[07:09] encrypted file come together and then
[07:11] you can walk them through how to uh
[07:13] recover the
[07:14] coins yeah yeah essentially so like
[07:18] there's this concept of I think it's
[07:19] called toxin uh where uh you have like a
[07:22] shared agreement and the last person to
[07:24] survive will get the shared value and in
[07:28] that case uh you
[07:29] uh
[07:30] only leave your Bitcoin to the person um
[07:34] yeah who is then nominated that doesn't
[07:37] not have to be the person uh who is in
[07:39] your written will but might be a person
[07:41] that uh is capable of recovering the
[07:43] funds themselves and who you trust but
[07:46] you don't trust with the keys during a
[07:48] lifetime but in the end then he will
[07:50] help your relatives or can be directly
[07:53] the relatives and then they have the
[07:55] option to also uh yeah use our services
[07:58] to back up or recover okay now we have a
[08:02] bitcoiner who is in self- custody who
[08:05] has the inheritance setup who has uh
[08:08] cedor where the backup is solid and
[08:11] there are I think additional steps you
[08:13] can even do beyond that and your Twitter
[08:16] handle is coin joint Chris be beyond
[08:19] that and the whole KC um topic what what
[08:23] do you do
[08:25] uh more than that uh is coin something
[08:30] uh you recommend everybody doing it or
[08:32] is it just like something for if you're
[08:34] really really in the Privacy fear so um
[08:39] I I remember I think you were there as
[08:41] well at uh was it in Ria Baltic honey
[08:45] bger I'm not sure there was a a
[08:46] fantastic talk by Rahim um and he
[08:50] essentially uh said privacy is not a
[08:54] right it is a um obligation you have to
[08:57] enforce it yourself uh it's not
[08:59] something that is freely given and um
[09:02] coin joining so the act of a pay join
[09:05] where you have multiple transactions
[09:06] going in multiple transactions going out
[09:08] of equal or same size like depending
[09:11] what what kind of use babis saabi or if
[09:13] use um rpool or there's many different
[09:17] uh yeah ways to do a coiner I'm not
[09:19] going to go into that it's a very uh
[09:22] yeah discussed topic but um in that way
[09:27] you can assure that there are no common
[09:30] ownership horis STS of a transaction so
[09:33] that if somebody because we have like
[09:34] Bitcoin it's not like ethereum where you
[09:36] have an account in Bitcoin we have utxos
[09:39] so individual uh Bitcoin um uh and those
[09:44] can be easily traced and there's a bunch
[09:46] of companies um that Trace payments and
[09:49] because everything is pseudonymous as
[09:51] soon as you have like a an on-ramp where
[09:54] you paid fiat currency at Kraken to get
[09:57] Bitcoin and then you did like five
[09:59] transactions those companies uh when
[10:02] they find out oh somebody along this
[10:04] line did something illegal um funded
[10:06] terrorism or whatever um they tried to
[10:09] figure out uh who this Bitcoin belonged
[10:11] to and maybe uh you will get caught in
[10:14] the crossfire because their methodology
[10:17] is not sound and not peer-reviewed and
[10:20] not tested however it's so far has held
[10:22] up uh uh people in in real court and in
[10:26] real prisons and with a coin join you
[10:29] can make this transaction much more
[10:32] private and I suggest uh everybody to
[10:35] have at least two sorts of stacks a kyc
[10:40] stack where you stacked your Bitcoin on
[10:43] pocket or relay or 21 Bitcoin where your
[10:46] name is associated with that because
[10:47] it's easy and usually get a better price
[10:50] and then there's another stack where you
[10:52] have no kyc Bitcoin and then in between
[10:56] if you want to have it more anonymous or
[11:00] to have more privacy you can have
[11:02] transactions uh yeah in a Whirlpool
[11:04] transaction where then in the end it is
[11:08] not possible to um yeah blame you for
[11:13] various transactions that may have
[11:14] happened along the line and yeah so I I
[11:18] suggest everybody to to look into that
[11:21] and see uh if that is something they're
[11:23] interested in and they can always write
[11:25] me and I will get give you good guidance
[11:27] uh it's become really easy it was not
[11:29] always that easy there's some really
[11:32] welldeveloped app like like Wasabi for
[11:35] desktop or Samurai wallet for for
[11:37] Android phones and uh if you have your
[11:40] own note you can use um join markets and
[11:44] um yeah it's it's a good way to enhance
[11:47] your privacy again because I think it's
[11:49] an obligation and if everybody does it
[11:52] um it's better and uh
[11:55] yeah it's it's an really cool solution
[11:58] to have like both because it's so easy
[12:01] to stack with the KC exchanges Bitcoin
[12:04] only exchanges like I completely went
[12:06] Bitcoin only exchanges I think two years
[12:09] ago I was on beon I don't know if you uh
[12:13] uh heard about that exchange
[12:15] before yeah it's German and then
[12:20] they then they started with two things
[12:23] they started with coining more and
[12:25] more before they had like four or five
[12:27] coins and I was like oh okay and then
[12:29] the Shino and everything came on there
[12:31] and that's was like ah okay that's not
[12:33] good because then all of a sudden of my
[12:35] my phone was like by now sheo and I'm
[12:37] like why is that notification popping up
[12:41] and then the second thing they did they
[12:42] asked me a really a lot of questions for
[12:45] like where's the money coming from what
[12:47] is that what is that like and I was like
[12:50] I don't want to tell you like
[12:53] it's it's already a lot to to give
[12:55] someone the information that I am this
[12:58] person and I'm buying Bitcoin but then I
[13:01] have to tell them oh I get got that
[13:03] money from there this is my salary stuff
[13:05] like that and I'm like this this is none
[13:07] of your business
[13:08] honestly yeah I mean I get the whole um
[13:12] procedure like when we do like we found
[13:15] a company and you go to the notary and
[13:16] all the stuff and I'm happy to show them
[13:18] my my ID because you you have to build
[13:20] trust with other people if you are like
[13:22] training in an economy and uh we can't
[13:26] go without uh like identifying ourselves
[13:29] but my problem is like with all these
[13:31] exchanges and all these uh data Krakens
[13:35] that collect unnecessary data or even if
[13:38] they have good arguments why they need
[13:39] that data they
[13:42] like they they store it piss poor and
[13:45] eventually they get hacked like this
[13:46] happens countless times time and time
[13:48] again and if you give them as little
[13:51] data as possible um you won't have to
[13:54] bear the consequences uh because they
[13:56] always always get hacked like just now
[13:58] treesa like 66,000 customer uh like
[14:01] information of people that own a treas
[14:04] hardware wallet is now out in the open
[14:06] and I myself like I'm in The Ledger
[14:09] leaks from like 2017 and there's my old
[14:12] address and like a parcel station that I
[14:14] used and like a phone number and you get
[14:16] calls and yeah try to limit the amount
[14:20] of information that you give people and
[14:23] um yeah best practice use single use
[14:26] emails stuff like that but I see a lot
[14:29] of bitcoiners getting uh into that
[14:32] sphere privacy and all the different
[14:34] topics you discover with Bitcoin when
[14:37] they discover actually Bitcoin was this
[14:39] also the case with you or had you this
[14:41] privacy in mind and this uh self-
[14:44] sovereignty mindset already before
[14:46] Bitcoin or was this something that
[14:47] actually developed with with Bitcoin I
[14:50] think it went hand in hand so like there
[14:52] was always a a decent amount of
[14:55] distrust in everything I was this
[14:59] annoying kid that usually like
[15:01] questioned everything to the Shag of
[15:03] most of the teachers that I had but um
[15:07] yeah when when then Bitcoin came along
[15:10] like I got into it I have to admit
[15:12] because of ngu number go up I got very
[15:15] early somebody gifted me some and I saw
[15:17] it rise and I sold it immediately and I
[15:19] thought wow look at me Warren Buffett
[15:21] over here and then along the line like
[15:24] uh oh wow it's now at a th000 now it's
[15:26] at 3,000 you have to get back in and you
[15:28] have to like fomo into different coins
[15:30] and like it for the longest time it was
[15:32] just about um becoming financially
[15:35] independent and now the more we push and
[15:38] move towards like a cbdc and all these
[15:41] things where a totally inept people that
[15:45] do not have the best of intentions like
[15:47] governments try to um again collect more
[15:51] information about you like with a
[15:53] central bank currency or like a a card
[15:56] everything digital they want to get rid
[15:57] of cash like they will trace or try to
[16:01] trace or get really close into your into
[16:04] your business and that drives me in even
[16:07] further into Bitcoin because to me that
[16:09] is like the way to opt out of this
[16:12]  and um yeah I had yesterday in
[16:16] podcast and the guest said about
[16:19] cbdcs like uh and it's an interesting
[16:22] thought he's like this will fail so
[16:25] dramatically because who will get that
[16:28] like who will adopt the bit uh cbdcs
[16:31] there's only disadvantages in there they
[16:33] have to pay me so much money to get this
[16:36] Bitcoin to get the cbdcs in hand and I'm
[16:39] like people are doing a lot for uh not a
[16:43] lot like they they are crazy incentive
[16:46] programs where like oh get this tax
[16:47] benefit oh get this small thing like get
[16:49] a cbdc and then you get a free
[16:51] McDonald's uh burger or something like
[16:54] that yeah I mean have you seen the lines
[16:58] outside of like the world coin the orb
[17:00] remember that that was
[17:02] crazy I don't know who you interviewed
[17:04] but the guy said oh no nobody's going to
[17:06] use that yeah I
[17:08] mean yeah imagine the the average smart
[17:12] person or like the average person like
[17:14] 50% is dumber than that person so uh
[17:17] there will be a lot of people I mean if
[17:19] it's just convenience like I myself I'm
[17:21] guilty of that like I pay with PayPal I
[17:24] pay with an MX because uh oh my MX gives
[17:27] me like 1% and cash back because it's
[17:29] this Fiat game like the vendor pays like
[17:32] 3% and then I get 1% back why not use
[17:35] that of course they do shady with
[17:37] my information but uh and it's not
[17:40] sustainable like this entire thing in my
[17:42] opinion but I I use it because it's easy
[17:44] like I like the idea of cash I like that
[17:47] nobody is in my business and knows what
[17:49] I pay for oh but but I hate like coins
[17:52] and change and like having this to carry
[17:54] this around I love just leaving the
[17:55] house with a phone like d d pay I'm
[17:58] super excited to announce that this
[18:01] podcast got the first ever sponsor 21
[18:05] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[18:08] they teach and preach self custody this
[18:11] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[18:14] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from this
[18:17] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[18:20] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[18:23] time support this podcast use code Robin
[18:26] and click the link in the description
[18:29] actually like and in Austria I don't
[18:31] know how it's actually in Germany but in
[18:32] Austria you can even have your um um IDs
[18:37] on the phone like you you don't have to
[18:39] carry anything you have your IDs on the
[18:41] phone in the ID Austria app and one on
[18:45] the one hand it's really uh convenient
[18:47] again because you don't have to have the
[18:49] wallet you don't have to have the
[18:50] physical car but then it's all stored in
[18:52] the phone it's all stored online but
[18:54] kind of stored anyways online somewhere
[18:57] uh and uh also cash uh it's it's like I
[19:01] see it on bitcoin meetups and Bitcoin
[19:03] conferences more like usually where I go
[19:05] is like most of them are just Apple pay
[19:07] and in Bitcoin circles there's the cash
[19:10] a little bit more still there but it's
[19:13] like cash will erode anyways I I don't
[19:16] think we can C save cash anyways it will
[19:20] go will go down and down and down you
[19:23] see the trends Co accelerated the whole
[19:25] thing like yeah I mean have you been to
[19:27] Sweden
[19:29] recently try paying with cash
[19:32] anywhere did they completely ban it or
[19:34] what what is I mean it's like all Visa
[19:36] like they they uh there's no no nobody
[19:39] uses cash anymore it's very easy to yeah
[19:42] Envision that I I think like Germany and
[19:45] I have to hold it to my German people um
[19:48] we sleep on many Trends um both because
[19:51] we're like distrustful but also because
[19:54] we like like new technology scares us
[19:56] apparently like country of thinkers and
[19:59] Engineers like at school we still have
[20:01] like overhead projectors and we don't
[20:03] have like Wi-Fi anywhere and like our
[20:05] intent is pure garbage and we still use
[20:08] fax machines like embarrassingly a lot
[20:10] of fax machines like the entire printing
[20:12] industry like just
[20:14] Germany and so that's what you know
[20:17] keeps me asleep at night that we are not
[20:20] moving that fast because our bureaucracy
[20:23] is so incompetent and too yeah they're
[20:27] not capable of like improving technology
[20:31] that quickly yeah I think the only
[20:33] cashless experience I had was in the red
[20:36] bu salsburg Arena uh like the Red Bull
[20:39] salsburg football club in in yeah in
[20:41] salsburg uh there there's no cash at all
[20:44] like you get a drink when you get back
[20:47] the the cup you get back your money on
[20:50] the card and not with with coins this
[20:53] was an interesting experience it's
[20:54] completely
[20:55] convenient the whole process is so much
[20:58] faster uh but yeah it's it's cash is
[21:01] dying anyways and that's why we kind of
[21:02] need Bitcoin
[21:04] right yeah I mean uh not only for that
[21:07] but just like if you ever done an
[21:09] international wire transfer like you
[21:10] want to stick a fork in your
[21:13] eye I buy and pay stuff or like pay
[21:16] people in Canada and Australia and uh if
[21:19] I like go to my credit union and say can
[21:22] you please wire my money to this person
[21:26] uh like don't expect it to happen in
[21:28] less than three days and with fewer than
[21:30] 50 bucks in fees like and you would
[21:34] think like like the Advent of the
[21:36] internet would have made this like
[21:37] instant but oh no no no there's so many
[21:40] banks in between that have to take a cut
[21:42] and it's it's ludicrous like I have
[21:45] people like in China where I
[21:46] manufacturer like uh this um it's a
[21:50] brass trolley token you put in your
[21:52] shopping cart and then you can release a
[21:54] shopping cart like the American people
[21:55] watching this won't know what that is
[21:57] but in in gery we don't trust people
[21:59] with shopping carts they could like run
[22:01] off with it you have to put like one
[22:02] Euro in and then you get like a shopping
[22:04] cart because that's enough people not to
[22:06] steal it apparently and this thing is
[22:08] like a a brass coin like with a Bitcoin
[22:11] and cedor logo and I had this
[22:14] manufactured in
[22:15] China um and yeah I I asked the guy
[22:19] because he had various commemorative
[22:21] coins like Bitcoin ethereum Monero coins
[22:23] there and I thought oh yeah he can do
[22:24] like a custom thing like this gave him
[22:26] the design and then when he made me the
[22:28] offer in US Dollars I asked him like how
[22:31] about you know taking Bitcoin uh despite
[22:34] during that time like Bitcoin was
[22:36] definitely again banned for the 1500th
[22:38] time in China he said yeah sure and he
[22:40] gave me like a bit for next address and
[22:42] I I wired him on chain and in 22 minutes
[22:45] like he said money received and in three
[22:48] days like he showed me like the CNC M
[22:50] tool to to emboss the coin like in that
[22:54] time no wire transfer would have arrived
[22:56] in in guano like no no chance in hell
[22:58] like just to save the time I pay the
[23:01] transaction fee like even today's
[23:03] transaction fees would be cheaper than
[23:05] like using a or Swift or like whatever
[23:08] kind of telegraphic transfer there is
[23:11] and that to me is just like we have a
[23:14] global economy we have like the internet
[23:18] like why don't we have like a global
[23:20] like money that is accepted everywhere
[23:22] oh yeah we have this it's
[23:24] Bitcoin yeah it's still it's still mind
[23:27] balling if you're find think about it
[23:29] it's just database entries and they need
[23:31] so long for for those to clear it's not
[23:35] not even final settlement because there
[23:37] there is no final settlement in Fiat
[23:39] kind of yeah I mean it's just like you
[23:42] kick the can down the road and
[23:43] everything is credit and if you think
[23:46] too long about it you like it's scary
[23:48] but like with Bitcoin it's so simple
[23:49] it's so beautiful like you can send it
[23:52] to somebody and they can immediately
[23:53] verify oh that that is legit Bitcoin
[23:55] that he sent me and that Bitcoin is now
[23:57] my and he can only like charge back or
[24:00] like force me to like I have to
[24:02] voluntarily give it back to him like
[24:04] it's like instantly settled you send it
[24:05] like from one place to another and like
[24:08] with with lightning or like all these
[24:09] developments now with like ecash it just
[24:12] gets keeps getting better and uh yeah
[24:16] happy for it um another thing you are
[24:19] actually doing and it is getting more
[24:22] more recognition recognition also I
[24:24] think in the global sphere I think there
[24:26] was an article already in the Bitcoin
[24:28] magazine I think a week ago uh about
[24:31] Terra has uh I mean uh what what is
[24:36] Terror has for like most people are from
[24:38] actually I know 70% actually from people
[24:41] listening to that are actually coming
[24:43] from America and I guess from America a
[24:46] lot of people did not hear about
[24:49] terahash uh I think uh maybe I'm I'm I'm
[24:53] wrong um what is terrahash and like what
[24:56] are you doing there in Germany
[24:58] so terahash is the the company to which
[25:01] I'm an advisor uh like my friend also
[25:04] Chris uh founded it uh in Germany and
[25:08] it's like in my opinion the first German
[25:10] Bitcoin company they do Pioneer work
[25:13] where they educate people on mining they
[25:16] invest in mining infrastructure they
[25:19] talk to energy providers and
[25:23] um building interesting TurnKey Concepts
[25:26] where we can integrate mining into all
[25:30] these different processes because like
[25:32] in Germany like the hash rate price um
[25:35] does not really allow for like just
[25:37] mining without making use of waste heat
[25:39] making use of stranded energy like it's
[25:42] really really tough like that's why most
[25:44] of the mining is being done in the
[25:45] United States we have like demand
[25:46] response programs and you have like
[25:48] Hydro energy and Paraguay and stuff like
[25:51] that and with
[25:53] terahash
[25:54] um yeah we try to uh bring in
[26:00] knowhow bring in decision makers like
[26:04] companies even politicians to make
[26:07] Bitcoin first more palatable to like
[26:10] people because it still has a very bad
[26:12] reputation yeah there's a lot of really
[26:15] really big things happening right now to
[26:17] which I cannot just yesterday we had
[26:19] like a big meeting I can't really
[26:22] disclose those and I leave it to to I
[26:24] think in Madera there's goingon to be a
[26:26] big announcement at the end of the month
[26:29] and um yeah
[26:31] so with terahash my plan uh would be
[26:36] to
[26:38] have verifiable proof that Bitcoin is a
[26:42] net benefit for everybody and to avoid
[26:45] that the German government as they did
[26:48] with like AI as they did with all this
[26:49] new technology where they try to
[26:51] regulate it and ban it and shoot
[26:53] themselves inevitably in the foot where
[26:55] you just point to all the benefits that
[26:59] there are because there's a lot of uh
[27:01] fud out there and um with a an entity
[27:05] like that you can uh yeah topel a lot of
[27:08] these myths and um there's a laboratory
[27:11] where we like do research uh on mining
[27:14] and we have tons of visitors uh from
[27:17] from like both local as well as from
[27:19] Berlin politicians and U yeah a lot of
[27:22] uh yeah things are moving there do you
[27:26] see um I mean we see a lot of things in
[27:29] in Europe and Germany uh happening
[27:32] around regulations and uh having like
[27:35] there's this saying uh you cannot ban
[27:38] Bitcoin but you can only ban yourself
[27:40] from Bitcoin and it I think it resonates
[27:43] with a lot of people and I think we in
[27:47] Europe in Germany also I think in
[27:48] Austria we have this kind of thinking
[27:50] where we want to regulate everything
[27:53] every small step should be so regulated
[27:55] till it's almost dead
[27:58] uh and and this why like if you look at
[28:01] the 20 most successful companies they're
[28:02] all kind of in America they're all the
[28:05] internet all happened in America kind of
[28:08] um do you see a chance where like Europe
[28:10] can be a Bitcoin uh uh
[28:15] region absolutely and like that's what
[28:18] we try to do to avoid doing what we
[28:21] missed out on the internet like we had
[28:23] all the plans in the 80s oh let's have
[28:25] fiber gigabit internet everywhere in
[28:27] every household and then our Chancellor
[28:30] back then was best buddies with a guy
[28:32] who owned like the um biggest uh
[28:34] television news conglomerate and he F
[28:36] felt threatened by the internet and then
[28:39] as soon as that guy got into office like
[28:41] all those plans were scratched and
[28:43] that's why there's like all these like
[28:45] there's Silicon Valley like we would
[28:46] have those like uh people here and we
[28:49] could have built companies of similar
[28:51] size like the biggest I think German
[28:53] born Enterprise is Shopify and the guy
[28:56] like straight off to Canada
[28:58] and built his business
[29:03] there come again I I didn't I did not
[29:05] even know that it was a German that
[29:07] founded it interesting yeah to to be as
[29:10] L like he's from like 50 kilometers this
[29:12] direction but yeah he's a a very
[29:15] successful founder and there is no there
[29:17] was not really like a startup scene in
[29:19] Germany or for like internet companies
[29:22] like we have like the sap and like
[29:24] software software companies but like we
[29:26] slept on a lot of these really big
[29:29] potentials and that's I'm afraid that
[29:32] that might happen in Germany as well or
[29:35] in Europe uh if like uh
[29:56] underinformative data does not support
[29:58] these things and just you have the
[30:01] unique position now that you can become
[30:03] a hub you can like a a a Pioneer and
[30:08] yeah yeah improve or
[30:11] like Germany could become a a a Bitcoin
[30:15] State I mean it's it's uh definitely
[30:17] possible if you you don't even have to
[30:20] support it just don't throw any stones
[30:23] in in our way and then yeah in 10 20
[30:26] years will look different yeah I think
[30:29] this is mean the general sense with
[30:31] Innovation like just let it happen just
[30:34] don't throw stones in the way of
[30:36] innovation and let it
[30:39] happen you can just slow it down in your
[30:42] region uh and this will benefit other
[30:45] regions like we see in El Salvador we
[30:47] see other nations that adopting it even
[30:49] like really close to us in Switzerland
[30:51] in Lugano I think there's a lot of uh
[30:55] things happening there Switzerland is
[30:57] also interesting uh use uh interesting
[31:01] case study because a lot of the best
[31:04] adoptions are happening in countries
[31:06] that need Bitcoin the most like Nigeria
[31:08] El Salvador and in countries like that
[31:11] Switzerland turkey like I don't think
[31:15] turkey like they're always on the
[31:16] all-time high in bitcoin price if you
[31:19] like use the Turkish L yeah like yeah so
[31:23] if if you not playing along in Germany
[31:25] like if you try to regulate it to hell
[31:27] uh then the talent will bleed away they
[31:29] will just move like people will build
[31:31] their companies in the United States and
[31:33] then you're not competitive like that's
[31:35] very simple and
[31:37] uh I don't want to see that because
[31:41] I a lot of people say oh we just gonna
[31:43] just gonna move to El Salvador or
[31:45] whatever like I really like it here I'm
[31:48] not gonna not gonna give give like
[31:51] Europe up easily to like the incompetent
[31:54] like yeah I think it's it's it's also
[31:56] something good to do like not just like
[31:58] flee from the problem and trying trying
[32:00] to fix the
[32:02] problem what interesting what has to
[32:05] happen for you to actually move to El
[32:07] Salvador some State like that like what
[32:10] what do German politicians or european
[32:12] politicians have to do for you to say
[32:15] okay enough is enough I cannot help
[32:17] those those guys I will leave now I mean
[32:20] that's really very easy answer to like
[32:23] I've I've thought about
[32:24] this in recent times a lot
[32:27] um yeah if if we start a war like there
[32:30] will be three people missing like me and
[32:32] the two uh soldiers looking for me
[32:36] because I'm not going to go into a meat
[32:39] grinder they're gonna draft me yeah you
[32:42] have to look for me in Vanuatu or
[32:43] somewhere like some place there
[32:46] like this entire concept of like you
[32:49] going killing somebody is like very
[32:53] like
[32:55] it's it's completely anti Bitcoin and I
[32:58] like the message also that Bitcoin
[33:00] defunds Wars uh and yeah really really
[33:03] cool I'm not so I don't entirely agree
[33:05] with that statement
[33:07] like like I think Rusty Russell wrote
[33:10] about this too like propaganda will
[33:13] always be there and propaganda is what
[33:15] like causes wars in the first place and
[33:18] like a gold standard or a Bitcoin
[33:19] standard has not prevented or hasn't
[33:21] demonstrated that it can prevent the war
[33:23] it will be much more difficult maybe
[33:25] like to get the funding you can't just
[33:26] make de to build like equipment or
[33:29] weapons but uh
[33:32] yeah violence will be solved like
[33:35] Bitcoin does not fix everything yeah
[33:37] definitely I think there's a lot of uh
[33:40] people that like for me Bitcoin in the
[33:42] end of the day is just money and it's uh
[33:46] maybe a too simple of a statement
[33:48] because money is so fundamental to our
[33:50] life and if you have as a government not
[33:53] the possibility to just create endless
[33:55] money you have to actually actually get
[33:57] it from the people that live in your
[33:59] jurisdictions so uh but you can still
[34:03] make it but the F you to convince them
[34:05] really hard and then like the uh yeah
[34:09] edged propaganda like that will be next
[34:12] level like they will 1984 levels where
[34:15] they just like Point everything else as
[34:18] the enemy and then you might have like
[34:19] another War where people like say oh
[34:21] let's let's go here's my Bitcoin build
[34:24] some bombs but uh yeah it will be much
[34:26] more difficult I agree yeah um maybe as
[34:30] a last question before we come to our
[34:31] Andro te you're doing so much in the
[34:34] Bitcoin sphere with different companies
[34:36] with uh trying to uh make Germany a
[34:39] better Bitcoin place um why at the end
[34:43] of the day are you so passionate about
[34:45] Bitcoin is there something that like
[34:48] drives you extremely that you like uh
[34:52] have this drive so I've uh had a lot of
[34:56] uh really
[34:57] like passionate projects Hobbies where I
[35:00] like dove in and had focused all my like
[35:03] attention on and then those faded away
[35:06] and I mean there's some other hobbies
[35:08] that to this day have like a really
[35:10] focused passion but um Bitcoin stands
[35:13] out at that regard that like for like
[35:15] better part of a decade I I really like
[35:19] like it and I like it more the more
[35:21] learn about it and I try to be skeptical
[35:25] of most things and always
[35:27] look from like different angles and try
[35:29] to disprove the thesis that Bitcoin is
[35:32] actually this beautiful thing this money
[35:34] and it's not that we are just the the
[35:36] the ghost drivers on the wrong side of
[35:38] the highway and it has not happened and
[35:41] it didn't succeed and finding like a
[35:44]  in the armor like something that
[35:46] disproves this thesis and that's so
[35:48] fascinating about it something like this
[35:50] Obsession that is good and uh like it's
[35:55] yeah sort of uh like the icky Guy where
[35:58] like I have a company that's now is very
[36:02] like successful and I have this this
[36:04] drive to make like Bitcoin better and to
[36:08] make more people aware of Bitcoin and
[36:10] all these things like they fulfill me I
[36:13] get paid for it and uh it's it's a
[36:16] benefit for society and that's what like
[36:19] yeah Bitcoin is essentially for me
[36:22] that's a beautiful uh point to end the
[36:24] podcast um we having an end routine
[36:26] where previous guest uh asked a question
[36:29] for the next guest and he asked like
[36:32] would it be possible to have cedor as
[36:35] gold like have uh your seeds stamped on
[36:38] gold I mean technically technically yes
[36:42] I would not recommend it like gold also
[36:45] like melts and uh it's yeah very meable
[36:49] and
[36:50] soft um and it will be like expensive
[36:54] you could use that money uh to stack
[36:55] some sets like like stainless steel is
[36:58] very good at the job um yeah gold is a
[37:02] Shiny Rock and like just yesterday I
[37:04] checked like bitcoin price was one
[37:07] Bitcoin 21.4 ounces of gold like yeah no
[37:11] gold is there to explain boom as Bitcoin
[37:14] that is that is a great statement never
[37:16] heard that
[37:19] one I read it on my five hours of
[37:22] Twitter a day somewhere like it's not I
[37:25] did not come up with it but yeah it it
[37:27] always works like why do I have need
[37:29] Bitcoin you know like gold it's a good
[37:30] store ah they get it immediately yeah I
[37:33] think uh my father also got gold but he
[37:36] got uh um Bitcoin not and and when
[37:39] somebody gets Bitcoin uh then it's
[37:42] easier to explain to them like if they
[37:45] actually get gold like some just buy it
[37:48] because they think oh it has a great
[37:49] history and stuff like that but if
[37:51] someone actually gets the properties of
[37:53] gold and why gold succeeded in the
[37:55] history then it's an easier switch for
[37:57] them to bitcoin but then there are
[37:59] examples like Peter shift but yeah
[38:01] that's another topic so he was your
[38:03] previous
[38:07] guest pet would be an interesting guess
[38:10] yeah uh but yeah I I don't know if I
[38:13] even want him uh yeah um where can
[38:17] people uh contact you the best where can
[38:20] people find you the best if they want to
[38:21] get in touch with
[38:23] you yeah I mean uh find us on Twitter
[38:26] like my business partner and I we manage
[38:28] the soror iio Twitter account myself I'm
[38:32] at coin joint you can write me on
[38:34] telegram you can write an email like I
[38:36] am very
[38:38] online you can you can reach me and yes
[38:42] so the people nearest and dearest to me
[38:44] they are sick and tired of me talking
[38:45] about Bitcoin so I'm always looking out
[38:47] for people who want to talk about
[38:49] Bitcoin with me so I'm happy to
[38:51] CHF that's kind of my origin story from
[38:53] the
[38:55] podcast yeah thank you for being on
[38:57] Chris thank you for having
[39:00] [Music]
[39:03] me
