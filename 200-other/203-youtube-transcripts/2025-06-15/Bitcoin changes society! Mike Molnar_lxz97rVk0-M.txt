[00:00] the only thing that it truly solves is
[00:02] the incentive problem that's all other
[00:04] than that human beings will still be
[00:06] human beings Fiat can and will be
[00:08] imposed by force it's no surprise that
[00:11] during that time there were preciously
[00:13] little Wars El Salvador is probably
[00:16] going to do quite well everybody will
[00:18] have a low time preference the law is
[00:21] the lowest form of acceptable human
[00:23] behavior the very second that the ETFs
[00:26] came out it opened the underlying asset
[00:29] which is Bitcoin to every Financial
[00:31] instrument possible if Bitcoin gets
[00:34] adopted to the extent we see it what do
[00:37] you think will be the last Bastion of
[00:40] Fiat to fall or you just open the can of
[00:43] worms my
[00:44] man usually I start as you know um with
[00:48] questions and then in the end there is
[00:50] end routine but I found the questions so
[00:52] interesting from the end routine that I
[00:55] wish I will do the first time ever the
[00:57] end routine in the beginning uh and the
[01:00] question from the previous guest for you
[01:02] was what do you think the historical
[01:05] significance of Bitcoin will be like in
[01:08] the future how will people look back at
[01:11] Bitcoin in like 100
[01:14] years if it gets adopted to the extent
[01:17] that we think it will get adopted it
[01:19] will probably be viewed as akin to the
[01:23] invention of gunpowder akin to the inven
[01:27] the the discovering of gold akin to the
[01:30] discovery of
[01:31] electricity if not it will become just
[01:34] another footnote in a series of failed
[01:37] attempts at improving the human
[01:39] race is there is there anything um like
[01:43] when you think of what can fail Bitcoin
[01:46] at this point is there anything you
[01:47] think of like uh this event would
[01:50] probably end Bitcoin is it like an
[01:52] internal bug is there something we don't
[01:53] know is it just a black swor or is there
[01:55] something else okay um I can think of a
[01:59] lot of things the question is always how
[02:02] probable is is it for that thing to
[02:05] actually to actually occur that's risk
[02:08] is always possibility of damage now
[02:11] amount of damage multiplied by
[02:14] possibility of that damage actually
[02:16] occurring yeah that that's how you
[02:18] calculate risk so sure if a giant
[02:21] asteroid hits the Earth and wipes out
[02:24] the human race to make a really dumb
[02:26] idea here that would totally stop
[02:28] Bitcoin
[02:31] um somebody actually hacking the sha256
[02:34] algorithm no absolutely not currently
[02:38] it's not a thing and even if we could
[02:40] just roll back to
[02:42] blockchain get a new algorithm and just
[02:45] agree that this is where we continue
[02:46] with it so yeah I can think of a lot of
[02:49] things some more stupid some less stupid
[02:51] some more dangerous so less dangerous
[02:54] everything that seems to be really
[02:55] dangerous to bitcoin is really unlikely
[02:58] to happen and everything that is likely
[03:01] to happen it doesn't do much doesn't do
[03:03] much damage
[03:04] really when you look at that way uh and
[03:07] I'm as you probably know all in Bitcoin
[03:10] like there is nothing else that I want
[03:12] to right now own I have some in the bit
[03:15] past I had some other stocks I had a lot
[03:17] of different experiences in a lot of
[03:19] other different Financial assets but
[03:21] right now I feel like Bitcoin is the
[03:23] only thing I even want to own uh exactly
[03:27] this reasons I don't know any other
[03:30] asset that is like comparable to that of
[03:33] the risk reward the the chance that we
[03:36] have at the adoption we can see in the
[03:40] next 50 to 100 years basically my
[03:43] lifetime um and the chance that it gets
[03:47] not there is so slow is so less and the
[03:51] chance that it could be be there is so
[03:54] big and which makes me wonder why do not
[03:59] more more people get it and it's I don't
[04:01] know I ask this question a lot but uh
[04:04] what what do you see in in your circle
[04:07] what's like the current uh hurdle that
[04:09] people don't get over
[04:10] it okay um in my job I I have a lot to
[04:14] do with uh Finance from the government
[04:17] side so I get to speak to those people
[04:20] there are several things that need to be
[04:22] taken into consideration here um and I
[04:25] initially would like to say the
[04:26] following we should stop it's this this
[04:30] isn't you but these people are around we
[04:32] should stop chastising people who we've
[04:35] already pulled to our side who've
[04:37] already allocated to bitcoin for not
[04:39] being 100% in Bitcoin we do not know
[04:41] about their circumstances we do not know
[04:43] about their level of understanding now
[04:46] what I have seen is I'm sorry several
[04:51] things first of all Bitcoin is
[04:54] complicated we think it's easy because
[04:57] we've already studied it we've already
[05:00] dive deep into it but the large part
[05:03] percentage of the people who actually go
[05:04] into this don't know anything about it
[05:07] they may know what the monetary
[05:08] background is or they but they don't
[05:10] know what the technological background
[05:11] is they know the technological
[05:13] background but not the monetary
[05:14] background so it's not uncommon for a
[05:17] new technology and Bitcoin is a very new
[05:21] technology especially compared to the
[05:23] alternatives for people to be
[05:25] cautious and why would you why would you
[05:29] think that this is a bad thing if we are
[05:31] right and I assume we are this
[05:33] hesitation will let us profit even more
[05:35] because we're the ones who are taking
[05:37] the advanced
[05:38] risk anyone taking the advanced risk
[05:41] will get more of the profit and the
[05:44] other ones will get on board later so
[05:45] everybody can adjust to his own risk
[05:48] behavior in how much he wants to
[05:51] allocate yeah that's uh very true and uh
[05:55] it's but I always see it like that when
[05:57] I approach people and I I became very
[06:01] passive with orange ping people because
[06:04] I take like I was this complete apostal
[06:08] of of orange biling people like just two
[06:11] three years ago but now I'm present
[06:14] everywhere with my clear name everybody
[06:16] knows me I'm the Bitcoin guy uh and
[06:18] everybody can come to me if they want to
[06:20] have education or they want to have like
[06:22] oh there are some free books you can
[06:24] start with there is where you can buy
[06:26] Bitcoin this is how I would probably
[06:28] start in the beginning to store Bitcoin
[06:31] um but I never bring Bitcoin up it it
[06:34] brings the the topic has to be brought
[06:37] up with someone else then I can join in
[06:39] in the conversation and it's really hard
[06:41] and I manage to do it in the family uh
[06:44] sometimes I do it when I feel like he or
[06:48] she can actually benefit a lot from from
[06:50] Bitcoin and he or she is right now open
[06:53] to the idea of something new that's
[06:55] really rare a situation where I feel
[06:56] like okay this this person could
[06:58] actually really benefit from right now
[06:59] from it um because honestly I cannot
[07:03] make a dent in the Bitcoin
[07:05] adoption I can I can shoot up 20 videos
[07:08] a day I can do whatever do I do I will
[07:12] make nothing as a dent in the Bitcoin ad
[07:15] option uh so if I speak about it uh it's
[07:18] just uh for me to get the word out uh
[07:21] but honestly I'm just like really small
[07:23] thing in the Bitcoin adoption and I'm
[07:25] aware of that so um I when I Orange Peel
[07:30] someone it's just because I want to give
[07:32] him something good because the Bitcoin
[07:34] price I cannot move
[07:36] him well especially now um ever since
[07:39] the ETFs came out the retail era of
[07:42] Bitcoin is over it's over we are now in
[07:46] the institutional era of Bitcoin I
[07:49] myself where I work um I do mention
[07:52] Bitcoin every now and then as a bit of a
[07:54] meme because people have gotten used to
[07:57] it like it's always fun to when you got
[07:59] a meeting with your boss and they all
[08:01] know it's going so anyone has anything
[08:02] to say and you were like yeah buy
[08:04] Bitcoin and everybody has a good
[08:06] laugh but it worked um I work in an
[08:09] environment where I have direct contact
[08:11] with
[08:12] around 400 people I was able to get five
[08:16] of them to to buy a certain amount of
[08:18] Bitcoin I think that's a good
[08:21] thing a very good thing why not we're
[08:24] not we're not going to influence the
[08:26] Bitcoin price but these are five people
[08:28] whose lives will be significantly
[08:31] changed to the better in the future if
[08:35] they can stick with
[08:37] it definitely what do you think uh
[08:39] because you thought said now the retail
[08:41] time is over now the institutional time
[08:44] started and I agree with that 100% uh it
[08:47] started somewhere around the last three
[08:49] years um you could pick the Michael
[08:52] sailor getting as a first publicly
[08:54] traded company in Bitcoin like as the
[08:56] starting point but with the ETF it
[08:58] really start started going the
[09:00] institutional uh side of it what do you
[09:03] think uh beyond the ETFs Beyond uh uh
[09:06] the next like five years the next
[09:09] adoption wave could
[09:11] be oh you just opened the can of worms
[09:14] my
[09:15] man okay so um if you want to do a deep
[09:20] dive into this I suggest you follow a
[09:23] guy on YouTube who is called British
[09:25] Hodel he already brushed on that I'm
[09:29] shortly going to I'm shortly going to to
[09:32] condense to condense that um the very
[09:37] second that the ETFs came out it opened
[09:40] the underlying asset which is Bitcoin to
[09:43] every Financial instrument
[09:46] possible now just look back in the past
[09:50] what the those Superman on Wall Street
[09:53] were able to do or
[09:56] destroy um the ETF you ain't seen
[09:58] nothing what do you think will happen
[10:01] when suddenly somebody decides maybe I
[10:03] already have to put out options on
[10:06] that what if suddenly the ETF can be
[10:09] traded with options because depending on
[10:12] who is offering them and who is selling
[10:15] them there might be a there might be a
[10:18] necess necessity to cover your own
[10:20] options which you buy or sell with the
[10:23] amount of Bitcoin just to to secure
[10:26] yourself in case your options go
[10:28] sideways what do you think will happen
[10:31] when derivatives and Structured Products
[10:33] come into play because in this case the
[10:37] problem is that with Bitcoin you either
[10:39] have it or you don't and at some point
[10:41] somebody's going to request that but as
[10:44] soon as this takes off we haven't seen
[10:46] nothing
[10:49] yet well well this this this this brings
[10:52] me to interesting fa because when
[10:54] bitcoiners have a lot of Bitcoin now and
[10:57] there are on the other side a lot of
[10:59] people that have a lot of claims maybe
[11:01] on bitcoin but not really a Bitcoin uh
[11:04] and but everybody wants a piece of it
[11:07] there's this meme going around that
[11:10] bitcoiners will be the future Banks
[11:12] because they want to huddle the Bitcoin
[11:14] they're really Frugal and they don't
[11:16] want to give it out but they are willing
[11:18] to like lend out or borrow out like
[11:20] whatever it is in whatever legal form it
[11:23] is like a really small portion and then
[11:25] you can do something with it or maybe an
[11:27] IOU with with that um um how do you see
[11:31] that go I mean there's also this thing
[11:33] where it's a proof of work um method so
[11:37] in the long run it will distribute
[11:39] nicely because you have to put in work
[11:41] to get it but how do you see the
[11:44] distribution and the adoption going with
[11:46] with bit Corners okay um it's a bit of a
[11:51] stretch to in my opinion this is all my
[11:54] opinion just for those who will comment
[11:56] furiously that I'm wrong this is just my
[11:58] dumb opinion it's a bit of a stretch to
[12:00] assume that bitcoiners who have a lot of
[12:03] Bitcoin will suddenly become
[12:06] Banks um I understand we have a lot of
[12:09] hate for Bankers Central Bankers
[12:12] sometimes Justified and sometimes
[12:14] unjustified but here's a fact Banks if
[12:18] the market was a bit less regulated
[12:21] would fulfill an extremely important
[12:24] role and function when it comes to the
[12:27] allocation of resources for investment
[12:30] or consumption this has always been the
[12:33] case countries that came out of Soviet
[12:36] Union rule one of the major problems
[12:39] they had is they did not have banking
[12:42] they did not have people whose main job
[12:44] was to collect resources and then do
[12:48] risk analysis and give it to people they
[12:50] thought were able to actually build
[12:52] something with it and then pay back with
[12:55] interest um the average bitcoiner is not
[12:57] a banker so even if the average
[13:00] bitcoiner engaged in that couldn't do it
[13:03] on their own there would still be
[13:05] institutional Mass have to be behind
[13:07] that and somebody who's an expert I I
[13:09] know we don't like that word expert but
[13:11] these are experts the second thing that
[13:13] I would like to say is again we can say
[13:16] all the things we want about banks that
[13:19] they're evil some that they're malicious
[13:21] capricious we can say all of that but
[13:24] for the most part and I know people will
[13:27] will contradict me that they're not
[13:30] stupid these people are not stupid they
[13:34] may have an over bloated ego they may
[13:36] overreach but in general they're not
[13:38] stupid do you really think that these
[13:42] Banks all of them we know UBS Bank of
[13:45] America JP Morgan the thousands of
[13:48] smaller Banks like in or Cal Banks or
[13:51] state whatever that they are just going
[13:53] to let this slip through their fingers
[13:57] no they won't no they w want they'd be
[14:00] dumb to do so at some point the pain
[14:02] becomes too big we already see the first
[14:05] steps happening just recently post
[14:08] Finance in Switzerland announced that
[14:10] you can now buy Bitcoin at them with
[14:12] them I'm sure other banks will follow
[14:15] what makes you think that these people
[14:16] will not at some point decide hey we
[14:19] going to lend Bitcoin there will be
[14:21] people who will deposit Bitcoin with
[14:23] those Banks they'll be dumb but they'll
[14:25] do it and then they will lend out those
[14:28] Bitcoins and those banks for all for all
[14:30] the negativity are in fact better suited
[14:34] to make risk analysis when it comes to
[14:38] lenders my take and I actually agree
[14:42] with that um because I think
[14:46] that we see it with self custody how
[14:48] many bitcoiners that are now so early in
[14:51] the game uh are actually doing self-
[14:54] custody I know uh people around me
[14:57] friends of mine uh who have Bitcoin they
[15:00] are fully in Bitcoin like 100% in
[15:03] Bitcoin and they are not self
[15:05] cing and I am talking to them and I'm
[15:09] saying like don't do this get in your
[15:11] get self custody I will show you how to
[15:14] do it I will guide you through like
[15:17] and and it's fascinating for me that
[15:21] bitcoiners and I think we always live a
[15:23] little bit in a bubble but if you uh
[15:26] look for people that just like ah I get
[15:28] Bitcoin I get that the monetary aspect
[15:30] will will grow it's like something like
[15:32] that but they don't have self-
[15:34] custody it's fascinating for me look you
[15:37] should stop because um if what happened
[15:41] with FTX and Sam bankman freed was not
[15:45] enough to scare these people not
[15:48] convince them scare them into taking all
[15:51] their Bitcoin into self- custody then
[15:53] nothing will then nothing will get
[15:56] wrecked absolutely and and this is why I
[16:00] think uh to come back to your previous
[16:03] point I think there will be Bitcoin
[16:05] Banks there will be uh always someone
[16:07] that takes care of of your Bitcoin
[16:10] because people are seemingly is are you
[16:12] also that opinion that even in the
[16:15] future like even if we are at a really
[16:17] full scale Bitcoin adoption like 100
[16:19] maybe 150 years um selfcast will still
[16:23] be a small part or can we learn it like
[16:26] today almost everybody can send an email
[16:29] as if we don't go to like the like 70
[16:32] years 80 years plus but is it like
[16:34] sending an email self cuss at some point
[16:37] or is it something that most people
[16:40] won't
[16:41] to okay there is a concept in economics
[16:44] which partially applies here it's called
[16:47] stickiness ever heard of it no okay
[16:51] stickiness is is a little bit broad it's
[16:53] usually used when it comes to changing
[16:55] from one provider to another let's
[16:57] assume that you are with a phone
[16:59] provider you get a plan and you play and
[17:02] you pay
[17:04] 10 10 units of a curreny per month now
[17:08] some other phone provider comes and he
[17:10] offers the exact same plan the exact
[17:14] same plan and he offers it for 9.5 units
[17:18] of
[17:19] currency what would the logical thing be
[17:21] the logical thing would be to
[17:22] immediately change to the other one
[17:24] because you're saving money but people
[17:27] won't that's what we call stick and they
[17:29] will refuse to change for because it's a
[17:33] hassle because they gotten used to their
[17:35] own phone provider because they're lazy
[17:38] so the difference between two options
[17:41] needs to reach a certain distance before
[17:44] this laziness this stickiness is
[17:47] overcome in terms of Technology um self-
[17:50] custody let's be honest here despite all
[17:53] the great um cold wallets that we
[17:56] have it's it's a hassle come on
[17:59] mean you have to buy it you have to set
[18:01] it up then you need to do a a a a backup
[18:04] seat of it maybe even a shamier
[18:07] distribution of it it's a hassle not
[18:09] many people want to do that whether
[18:12] self- custody will go up in the future
[18:14] is dependent or whether we can overcome
[18:16] that
[18:17] stickiness to make it so easy for people
[18:20] that it's not going to cost them too
[18:22] much in order to switch from other
[18:25] people coding it to self- custody and
[18:28] that is happening technology is getting
[18:31] better at some point I'm sure setting up
[18:33] a code world will be much
[18:37] easier yeah yeah I hope
[18:41] so but you're right uh because you have
[18:44] to care for it and then you also have to
[18:46] ask all those questions yourself uh if
[18:48] you have just an exchange uh you used to
[18:51] that login password maybe to fact
[18:54] authentification and stuff like that
[18:55] you're used to that with all your logins
[18:59] but then when it comes to self- custody
[19:01] you all you have to do something you
[19:04] probably never have done
[19:06] before you have to take care of your
[19:08] keys then as you said you have to pack
[19:10] up stuff like that then if you have a
[19:12] lot of money you have to think of multi
[19:14] signature and then you have to think oh
[19:16] but uh maybe I want to have some
[19:18] inherent stuff like that like there's
[19:20] there's all of the sudden there's a lot
[19:22] of things to think yourself there's time
[19:25] that gets into that there is risks
[19:27] involved in that because if you do it
[19:29] yourself you're responsible and you can
[19:32] mess up uh when you're not educated and
[19:35] you just do it from um
[19:38] something so there's a lot a lot going
[19:40] in there um you also mentioned a British
[19:43] hotle and uh I was I also had him wanted
[19:46] to to I had him on the podcast too and I
[19:49] love this interview with him uh and I
[19:52] encourage everybody to check it out and
[19:54] he said something that most bitcoiners
[19:58] uh uh disagree with I think or like some
[20:03] I don't know with most but I think most
[20:05] of my guests disagreed with him on this
[20:07] part he said that fat will always be
[20:09] around he said that uh um the the fat
[20:13] system uh will always be around in some
[20:16] capacity at least in our lifetimes um do
[20:20] you think that Fiat can be around in
[20:23] like the next 50 to 100 years yeah I
[20:26] actually fully agree with British hold
[20:28] that Fiat will always be around um
[20:32] several factors that come into it I
[20:34] don't know which ones he mentioned but
[20:36] this was a quite Lively discussion I had
[20:38] with a fellow Economist who is also into
[20:41] Bitcoin first of all Fiat can and will
[20:44] be imposed by force I mean to borrow
[20:48] from the mmt argument um as long as
[20:51] governments can demand that you pay your
[20:55] taxes your road taxes your um Social
[20:59] Security in Fiat they are forcing a Fiat
[21:03] system to exist now as much as I would
[21:05] like for governments all cease to cease
[21:08] to exist tomorrow not going to happen
[21:11] and as long as they can impose Fiat they
[21:15] will and they are doing it with cbdcs
[21:17] right now or they're trying at least so
[21:19] Fiat will always be around the last one
[21:22] is again um as long as it is easier to
[21:26] make payments with Fiat stickiness will
[21:29] prevent people from using anything else
[21:33] if lightning takes off completely it
[21:35] will burn out a lot of the Fiat stuff
[21:39] but that doesn't mean that Fiat won't be
[21:40] around for certain government issued
[21:42] services or services that the government
[21:44] deems should not be paid with crypto or
[21:46] sorry
[21:49] Bitcoin uh it's it's it's interesting
[21:52] because uh this this Crypt not Bitcoin I
[21:55] always like when when I get a comment
[21:57] with uh uh something that I completely
[21:59] agree with uh but he uses the word
[22:02] crypto instead of Bitcoin I said like
[22:04] agreed but Bitcoin not crypto
[22:08] please it's look we all have these tiny
[22:11] things that irk us and I think it's a
[22:14] good thing I think it makes us human
[22:17] it's nice Definitely yeah definitely
[22:19] it's really interesting the fact that uh
[22:22] feed will always be around uh for me
[22:24] it's when I look out long enough like
[22:28] Fiat can be around like 200 years
[22:31] thousand years like it can be around a
[22:33] long time because we know from the
[22:35] history money takes a long time to to to
[22:38] get adopted and but I I see no reason
[22:43] why we should not switch at some point
[22:46] uh to a full Bitcoin standard I agree
[22:48] 100% that there is a lot of work to do
[22:51] like we are not even not even close to
[22:53] it because I also had someone on
[22:56] completely on other side who said uh he
[22:59] could imagine that the Fiat will
[23:02] hyperinflate so much in the next like
[23:05] five years uh that we seeing the Bitcoin
[23:07] standard way sooner than that I also had
[23:10] the guy Swan on he said like he cannot
[23:13] imagine seeing not a Bitcoin standard in
[23:16] the
[23:17] 2030s um I have a hard time seeing no
[23:21] Bitcoin standard in the next like 500
[23:24] years uh but I I don't think and it's
[23:27] also a little bit controversial but I
[23:29] don't think actually that uh feat uh
[23:33] will go away while I live I would be
[23:36] surprised like uh I would be surprised
[23:38] if it's that
[23:40] fast short insert here just two things
[23:43] which I've noticed uh first of all so
[23:46] you're telling me that um Fiat might go
[23:48] away because it will suffer from
[23:52] hyperinflation I can give you five
[23:54] examples of hyperinflation in countries
[23:57] and all they did was invent a new kind
[23:59] of Fiat so I I'm not saying that your
[24:02] argument isn't somewhat valid but I
[24:05] think this would be a very fair point to
[24:06] criticize it upon the the deuts Reich
[24:10] Mark had
[24:11] hyperinflation got a new one the
[24:14] Zimbabwe dollar got hyper got a new one
[24:17] and when Venezuela's currency completely
[24:20] gets obliterated they'll get a new one
[24:23] so I get you point this would be the
[24:26] counter example the second one is
[24:28] something that you said and I hear this
[24:29] quite often you said I cannot
[24:33] imagine XY
[24:36] Z okay that means you cannot imagine it
[24:39] you cannot imagine why Fiat wouldn't
[24:42] completely disappear now ask a
[24:46] politician ask ask anyone whose
[24:50] life depends and relies on Fiat money on
[24:55] a Fiat world and ask them how they think
[24:57] about it and then tell me again how that
[24:59] works out for you I'm not trying to be
[25:02] antagonistic here I'm trying to tell you
[25:04] is for every one of you and me who can
[25:08] who cannot imagine that there's
[25:09] thousands of people often with much more
[25:11] power and better propaganda machines who
[25:13] can absolutely imagine that and they
[25:16] will do anything and everything in their
[25:18] power in order to keep it and quite
[25:21] frankly they might be able to keep parts
[25:23] of
[25:25] it you said before there's no reason why
[25:28] we should shouldn't have a Bitcoin
[25:29] standard okay fair enough even under a
[25:33] Bitcoin standard they can still be a
[25:35] Fiat system and I don't think that we're
[25:37] going to get rid of it that fast also I
[25:41] think we have a little bit of a
[25:42] misunderstanding here on the timeline
[25:44] sure if we talk about an infinite
[25:47] timeline then anything becomes possible
[25:49] on an infinite timeline every sing the
[25:52] probability of anything happening tends
[25:54] towards
[25:56] 100% but I'm going to talk about I don't
[25:59] know my own lifetime here so I got
[26:01] another
[26:02] good I'll be optimistic 70 years to go
[26:06] yeah I I got another 70 years and within
[26:09] that time frame no I don't think Fiat is
[26:11] going to go away yeah I agree with that
[26:14] I said it before like I think lifetime
[26:16] wise uh it will be really hard for me to
[26:19] see Fe go away uh because of so many
[26:23] reasons but yeah let's see uh I'm I
[26:26] certainly wish for it
[26:29] I wish for a lot of things
[26:32] yeah uh there's this uh I talked with
[26:35] British all also about that this happy
[26:38] hippie tree uh uh revolution in the
[26:41] Bitcoin we like oh we are on the Bitcoin
[26:44] standed and then we are hugging trees
[26:45] and everything will be fine I also don't
[26:48] agree with that one uh but I like his
[26:51] his stand on a lot of things even though
[26:52] he gets a lot of hate also in the
[26:53] Bitcoin Community it's it's interesting
[26:55] how it goes um in order to to capitalize
[26:59] on that just um we have this saying like
[27:02] Bitcoin solves
[27:04] this um it's true to some extent Bitcoin
[27:07] the only thing that it truly solves is
[27:10] the incentive problem that's all other
[27:13] than that human beings will still be
[27:15] human beings and why shouldn't we let
[27:17] them be I mean I assume that most Maybe
[27:21] I'm Wrong most of us bitcoiners tend to
[27:24] be more on the libertarian or Anarchist
[27:26] side of things so are perfectly happy
[27:29] for other people to have what they enjoy
[27:31] even if we don't enjoy it and if Bitcoin
[27:35] just solves the monetary incentive
[27:37] problem and puts that right
[27:39] including um the T the the time problem
[27:43] whether you have short or longterm views
[27:44] on on
[27:46] time I'm fine with that if it solves
[27:48] that everything else you can go hug your
[27:50] trees other people have an incentive
[27:52] once that is solved to do different why
[27:55] not go have it your way told you a lot
[27:58] about 21 Bitcoin the best place for me
[28:01] to buy Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin
[28:03] only exchange but now let's talk about
[28:06] how to secure your Bitcoin once you got
[28:09] Bitcoin you don't want to leave them on
[28:10] Exchange you want to take self custody
[28:14] you want to take responsibility of your
[28:16] own Bitcoin that's why I recommend
[28:19] getting a bitbox bitbox is an amazing
[28:22] wallet where you can not only keep your
[28:25] Bitcoin in a simple way very secure you
[28:28] you can even create a passphrase with
[28:30] that passphrase you can basically create
[28:33] a hidden wallet on the device itself
[28:37] make sure to buy your bitbox in the link
[28:40] down in the description and with code
[28:42] Robin you even get a 5% discount I love
[28:45] it uh I would I would love uh uh and
[28:49] it's it's interesting for me uh this
[28:51] this this whole thing with with the
[28:53] Bitcoin adoption because we want to see
[28:56] more and more adoption we want to see
[28:59] Bitcoin succeed but we are in a such an
[29:03] early stage and I think this is also the
[29:04] reason why we have so many uh bitcoiners
[29:08] tell us that uh it changed their life
[29:12] and Bitcoin actually can change a life
[29:14] there are so many examples of that but I
[29:16] think it's not necessarily because uh
[29:20] Bitcoin does something with you um it's
[29:23] probably more because Bitcoin uh um in
[29:28] uce you to a community of Libertarians
[29:31] and and free thinkers uh and it kind of
[29:35] changes your environment a little bit
[29:37] you you all of all of the sudden see
[29:38] something and you get introduced to
[29:41] something I don't know exactly what it
[29:42] is I definitely know that people lives
[29:46] get changed in the society or like maybe
[29:48] not Society but the small lives get
[29:51] changed from that uh interesting will be
[29:55] if there will be a massive change change
[29:58] on a society level on a global scale uh
[30:02] uh for Bitcoin I asked the question I
[30:04] think almost in every episode um when
[30:08] Bitcoin will be more and more adopted
[30:11] and we are seeing now Bitcoin prices
[30:13] from 1 million 10 million 100 million I
[30:15] don't know where we go um if if Society
[30:19] actually fundamentally change or
[30:21] everything will stay the same because
[30:23] all of the sudden more people have a
[30:25] sound
[30:26] money well um it it can change by
[30:31] putting different incentives by by
[30:33] imposing actual cost those changes can
[30:37] occur um let's take something really
[30:39] controversial let's take
[30:41] religion um Bitcoin is not going to
[30:45] change anyone from being a devout
[30:47] Christian Jew or Muslim it's not going
[30:50] to change the the cultural environment
[30:54] they would like to live in what it will
[30:57] do is it will no longer allow people to
[31:01] act on certain impulses without bearing
[31:04] the
[31:05] cost for example right now it is
[31:08] extremely cheap for Any Nation as we've
[31:11] seen to wage war because they can just
[31:14] print as much Fiat as they want dilute
[31:16] their currency rob their
[31:19] people but as soon as you actually have
[31:21] to pay the price I think we may very
[31:24] well enter a a new Bok
[31:28] and I don't know how much you know about
[31:30] that the B was basically the time in
[31:32] Europe where the gold standard reigned
[31:35] Supreme and it's no surprise that during
[31:38] that time there were preciously little
[31:40] Wars because anyone who wanted to engage
[31:43] in a war would have had to pay the price
[31:47] in Gold so it became extremely costly to
[31:52] enforce you of USS with violence and any
[31:54] war that you wanted to wage you actually
[31:56] had to convince the people to bear the
[31:58] cost the The Strife that came with it so
[32:03] if we enter a phase where Bitcoin
[32:05] becomes the main store of
[32:07] value how many how many countries do you
[32:12] think depending whether they be
[32:15] Christian Muslim Jewish whether they be
[32:18] um I don't know culturally more
[32:20] aggressive or less aggressive how many
[32:22] of them do you think will feel
[32:24] comfortable engaging in any kind of
[32:27] aggression
[32:28] when they suddenly have to bear the cost
[32:30] of
[32:31] it I don't think they will I don't think
[32:34] that that's going to be the time say
[32:35] well fine we would really love to fire
[32:38] 15,000 rockets at you we would really
[32:41] love to send in 20,000 soldiers into
[32:44] this area or that area but the problem
[32:47] is we have to pay for these rockets in
[32:50] satoshi's we have to pay for these
[32:52] soldiers in
[32:54] Satoshi and we can't just make new
[32:57] Satoshi
[32:59] so maybe finding a more diplomatic
[33:01] solution would be
[33:03] better Bitcoin changes incentives and it
[33:06] imposes cost nothing else in my opinion
[33:10] but this uh changing incentives I think
[33:13] who said it Charlie manga said it I
[33:15] think um show me your five biggest
[33:18] incentives and I will show you what you
[33:20] will do or something like that along the
[33:22] ways and I think uh the incentive of a
[33:25] person shows uh his actions in the long
[33:29] run or even the short run um so I think
[33:32] if if we if Bitcoin changes the
[33:35] incentives uh of of society it actually
[33:39] changes a lot in in society
[33:41] fundamentally so it's it's interesting
[33:44] for me to think absolutely on that level
[33:46] yes you're absolutely right in that
[33:48] level it will I I may have not
[33:51] generalized it enough so yeah I'll give
[33:53] you that one absolutely yeah really cool
[33:56] um maybe uh let's dive deep into not
[34:00] deep but let's dive into your um
[34:03] personal uh discovery of Bitcoin um you
[34:06] discovered Bitcoin uh like because we we
[34:10] talk a lot about this hurdles of of
[34:13] getting into Bitcoin and and and seeing
[34:16] Bitcoin and I think a lot of people
[34:19] almost everybody uh heard at least about
[34:22] it at least in in our Western
[34:24] Civilization I don't know how it's in
[34:25] other countries um but not a lot of
[34:29] people make the efforts to learn about
[34:31] it because their pain is not enough
[34:34] their their curiosity is not high enough
[34:38] uh what piqued your interest like why
[34:40] did you get into uh Bitcoin did you got
[34:44] gold before did you got the Austrian
[34:46] economics mindset before okay um during
[34:50] my time at University when I studied
[34:52] economics I had a professor who was an
[34:56] Austrian not a very outspoken one which
[34:59] I highly
[35:00] admired but he was an Austrian and he
[35:02] got me into the whole Austrian
[35:05] mindset um I got into Bitcoin by
[35:09] accident afterwards when I was in a pub
[35:11] I was uh drunk like hell and this guy
[35:15] was yapping my earful of Bitcoin and
[35:18] then I bought some not going to say how
[35:20] much and at what time that was and I
[35:23] woke up the next morning didn't know
[35:24] what to do with it and forgot about it
[35:26] and I only rediscovered years later when
[35:28] it shoot through the roof already and
[35:32] that's when I started to to investigate
[35:35] what exactly Bitcoin was I went through
[35:37] all the the online resources and because
[35:41] I had engaged in there were courses you
[35:44] could take at University for specific
[35:45] interest in monetary Theory I found it
[35:48] actually perfectly aligned with monetary
[35:51] Theory and what the alln thought about
[35:52] it and that was like all right if it all
[35:55] fits then it must be true so far I hear
[35:58] no counterargument to it and that's when
[36:01] I really started to get into
[36:03] it that's amazing yeah I think it's uh
[36:06] great that uh first of all it's it's
[36:09] interesting that you said austr mindset
[36:11] I think maybe for some new people we
[36:13] talk about and because I when I first
[36:15] started in Bitcoin I actually had this
[36:17] question in mind when we talk about
[36:19] Austrian mindset we talking about the
[36:20] Austrian economics like the not the
[36:23] right now economics in
[36:26] Austria as it's it's the a economics um
[36:30] for like Hayek and mises and stuff like
[36:32] that um I think when when you Google a
[36:34] economics you can get in this whole
[36:37] Rabbit Hole uh because actually in the
[36:40] first ever um yeah sessions when I do
[36:43] deep into Bitcoin I was like why is
[36:46] because I discovered Austrian economics
[36:48] with Bitcoin I was like why is everybody
[36:50] talking about Austria there's nothing
[36:52] special about
[36:54] Austria I our economic economics is like
[36:58] Germany it's like like it's not it's not
[37:01] different so different from everybody
[37:04] else's why is everybody talking about
[37:05] Austrian economics so uh I think uh I
[37:08] always try to be aware of of new
[37:10] listeners that are asking what's what's
[37:12] special about Austria because I'm
[37:14] sitting here and I'm also
[37:15] Austrian I know the same question your
[37:18] your Capital has some really nice
[37:23] roads we we have a beautiful country in
[37:27] general I had one one guy on and said
[37:31] like this grass in Austria is so green
[37:33] it's so clean here but uh it's it's in
[37:35] in Switzerland the same uh I think
[37:38] Germany also kind of uh but yeah Al
[37:42] Austria is beautiful but yeah absolutely
[37:45] is that's cool yeah um for
[37:51] the for the next conversation um I think
[37:55] that we always talking about
[37:58] the the impact that Bitcoin has on
[38:01] society and we have in the history when
[38:05] we look at Art and when you look at
[38:08] architecture in in Bitcoin um and we see
[38:12] this big Roman Empire we see now America
[38:15] we saw so many different Empires rise
[38:17] and fall uh I think you probably are
[38:20] familiar with r alio Theory with the
[38:23] rise and fall of of of of Empires read
[38:25] it um uh and it's interesting for for me
[38:30] to to see now and we have this meme now
[38:32] with Bitcoin is the next like there this
[38:35] meme where from Ray daros uh China now
[38:39] climbing up and America going down where
[38:41] we exchange China for for Bitcoin uh do
[38:44] you see something like that that we
[38:46] actually uh go away from those kind of
[38:49] cycles and and the monetary stand not
[38:52] expanding there okay
[38:54] um depends
[38:57] [Music]
[38:58] whether you have good money sound money
[39:00] or bad money that's just one ingredient
[39:03] it then depends on whether you use it so
[39:06] if nation states on a whole just
[39:10] steadfastly refuse to accept sound money
[39:14] because of the the downsides that it has
[39:17] to their irrational spending then these
[39:20] Cycles at least for individual nation
[39:22] states will continue while it will not
[39:25] continue for those who adopt
[39:28] Bitcoin the question is who will do so
[39:31] we can say that El Salvador is probably
[39:33] going to do quite well we can also say
[39:37] that countries like China they're a bit
[39:40] on the they're a bit on the brink I mean
[39:44] we're all talking about how China has
[39:46] outlawed and banned Bitcoin well now
[39:48] they're bringing it back Hong Kong wants
[39:50] to issue its own Bitcoin
[39:52] ETF and again the Chinese are quite
[39:55] pragmatic people I think they could make
[39:57] a
[39:58] turnaround if we have sound money then
[40:01] this whole cycle may stop it may because
[40:05] unlike with the other forms of money
[40:07] that we had no single nation state will
[40:10] be able to dilute it I mean the Roman
[40:13] Empire fell when they started to
[40:16] introduce inflation by clipping away at
[40:19] their gold coins making them smaller
[40:21] diluting them the B ended when they
[40:25] abolished the gold standard Any Nation
[40:27] in the future that adopts it could start
[40:30] to adopt something else the question is
[40:32] will the people be willing to
[40:33] participate in that I don't think this
[40:36] cycle will end I think the cycle is not
[40:39] dependent to a sufficiently large degree
[40:42] on the money I think it's dependent on
[40:45] culture and I think it's dependent on
[40:46] the nation state that decides within its
[40:48] borders how it will use
[40:52] Bitcoin see also a lot of culture going
[40:54] on because I see when uh
[40:57] culture Rises um
[41:02] people kind of get
[41:04] lazy uh and then counter is on the
[41:07] bottom uh they are I see and and this is
[41:12] something more subjective and more my
[41:15] personal View and my personal feeling uh
[41:18] that are way more um yeah excited about
[41:22] work and they they are hardworking and
[41:24] they're doing more so I'm I'm in I'm
[41:27] also kind of thinking that even if we
[41:30] got s money standard that the Cycles
[41:32] probably will be different uh but there
[41:35] will always be counties that are ahead
[41:38] and then over Generations because people
[41:41] are that build the generation uh are
[41:45] building a better future and then the
[41:48] better future provides more comfortable
[41:50] life and this comfortable life makes you
[41:52] a little bit more lazy uh and then there
[41:55] will be another relation that is not
[41:56] that good off and this kind of um
[42:00] motivated to work harder uh but that's
[42:03] just my personal Theory from what I've
[42:06] seen also with um my in my personal life
[42:10] I see families where the kids are from
[42:14] families that are well well off and they
[42:16] can live off stuff uh they're often not
[42:19] as uh motivated as the kids that have to
[42:22] suffer a little bit more uh and want to
[42:25] to do it like but that's just personal
[42:27] thing okay if I can interject there just
[42:30] a little bit um I I I resent the the
[42:35] thought that this rising in work ethic
[42:40] staying and then going is as simple as
[42:42] reading buen Brooks which is like a
[42:45] perfect microcosm if anyone hasn't read
[42:47] the book you should read buen Brooks
[42:49] it's the rise and fall of a merchant
[42:52] family in Lubec or short sleeve to short
[42:54] sleeve in three generations or so
[42:57] um I this is just me the word culture is
[43:02] often used in Daily speech you just did
[43:04] it but people don't know what it
[43:06] actually means you said when culture
[43:10] Rises people get lazier afterwards now
[43:14] culture has a
[43:15] definition I'm going to give a
[43:17] half-hearted one out here culture
[43:19] describes
[43:21] collectively the beliefs behavioral
[43:24] practices and patterns which are held to
[43:27] to be of great importance by A specific
[43:29] group of people in a specific place at a
[43:31] specific time that's it that's all there
[43:34] is to it so cultures do not rise or fall
[43:39] that's that's yeah you can say it in a
[43:42] meta but what happens is culture changes
[43:45] so it's not that the next generation is
[43:49] losing out due to poor work ethics or
[43:52] whatever because the culture did
[43:54] anything the culture changed if their
[43:57] culture was still the same as their
[43:59] parents they would hold the same values
[44:02] that hard work pays
[44:04] off if not then the culture just has
[44:07] just changed so hard times create a
[44:10] culture in which people value things
[44:13] that make them Rise Again Good Times
[44:16] create a culture where people do no
[44:18] longer hold these values and these
[44:20] people then create bad times again what
[44:24] Bitcoin can do is it can move one part
[44:29] of that cultural equation of these
[44:31] Behavior patterns which influence how
[44:34] people what people will view as
[44:36] valuable the one thing it does and this
[44:39] is very important is time
[44:41] preference time preference is the one
[44:43] thing that Bitcoin can completely remove
[44:46] everybody will have a low time
[44:49] preference if Bitcoin takes over and
[44:51] that can be a very useful thing that can
[44:54] be a cultural pattern what one part of
[44:57] the whole that will boost give a massive
[45:00] boost to people their work ethic and how
[45:01] they view the world everything else it's
[45:04] up to
[45:05] them H that's an amazing explanation I
[45:08] could not have uh put it better I think
[45:11] uh cultural I never fought of the
[45:13] definition as you said uh of of of
[45:16] Culture Rising and as you said the the
[45:19] behaviors and stuff like that is that is
[45:21] in there really really cool we had this
[45:24] one professor at a
[45:27] in school in University I hated him I
[45:30] hated him so much um whenever you put in
[45:35] a an essay or whatever he had this
[45:39] really
[45:41] really weird Behavior he would go around
[45:43] he would do that and each student he
[45:46] would go to him take out his essay and
[45:48] he would pick a word and say Define it
[45:51] and if you were unable to Define it he
[45:54] would deduct points so you had to made
[45:57] damn sure that you knew the definition
[45:59] of every word that you used in your
[46:02] essay he probably did this so people
[46:04] wouldn't attempt to sound smart when
[46:06] they are not do it yourself go around
[46:09] and ask your colleagues when they use
[46:11] the word culture Define culture see how
[46:13] many can do it and then go on the Oxford
[46:16] language dictionary type and culture
[46:18] there's the explanation set of
[46:19] behavioral patterns deemed to be
[46:21] important or of high value by blah blah
[46:23] blah it helps it helps it is it's
[46:27] extremely cool uh and I think um with
[46:31] sounding uh like that's really cool
[46:35] because when you think of it and this is
[46:38] what uh that's why people don't like
[46:41] this experts like this uh when we go to
[46:44] Banks and the financial experts what we
[46:46] touched on earlier that bitcoiners don't
[46:48] like this experts because they're not
[46:50] really expert they're just like using uh
[46:52] bullet Bingo that to sound uh smart but
[46:55] this a whole another topic now um before
[46:59] we get into the end routine I thought of
[47:02] a new end routine for this one because
[47:04] we have the question already in the
[47:05] beginning um what are you currently and
[47:08] it does not have to be about Bitcoin
[47:10] what are you currently uh studying what
[47:12] are you currently really passionate
[47:15] about currently so um due to me working
[47:19] in government and I'm trying to move up
[47:21] because I'm an egoistic POS and I want
[47:25] to get paid better I was looking into
[47:28] various leadership positions which I
[47:30] could attain still and I noticed
[47:32] something that most of the people who
[47:35] are in charge of departments or sections
[47:38] they all have one type of degree the
[47:39] worst degree that you can have outside
[47:42] of all the degrees that end in studies
[47:45] they're all
[47:46] lawyers they're all
[47:48] lawyers so I am currently um trying to
[47:52] get a law degree that's what I'm I'm not
[47:55] passionate about it but I am serious
[47:57] about
[47:58] it I think a lree is actually really a
[48:01] good one uh I also thought a lot about
[48:04] uh getting it myself uh not because I
[48:06] want to reach some uh some some high
[48:09] position or something like that as I'm
[48:12] full-time working here I'm the only one
[48:14] working here so the I have the highest
[48:15] and lowest
[48:17] position uh as of now uh so but I think
[48:21] law is really interesting because it's
[48:23] the study of our current system
[48:25] basically of our current legal system
[48:27] and it helps to know what system you're
[48:31] living in even if you don't agree with
[48:33] some of the practices and some of the
[48:35] things in here but it just helps you
[48:37] personally so much if you know the ins
[48:39] and out of the system right yeah um I
[48:43] agree ever since I started studying it
[48:45] um it has changed my thinking it is
[48:47] extremely interesting I get a lot out of
[48:50] it but at the same time it
[48:52] exposes some of the worst machinations
[48:55] that take place face which were
[48:59] sometimes introduced with the best of
[49:02] intentions and we now see how they are
[49:05] being completely abused with a smile and
[49:08] a wink because well it's the law good
[49:11] explanation that's great it's the law I
[49:13] always love that one do you think there
[49:16] has to be there should be an expiration
[49:19] date on law I heard that a
[49:21] lot um no or if there is an expiration
[49:26] date they should already be a
[49:27] replacement in them one of the main
[49:29] functions that the law has there is this
[49:32] whole course we had to take it's called
[49:34] Legal Theory which is not really law it
[49:37] explains to you what the law does and
[49:39] how it fits into
[49:40] society one of the main things that the
[49:43] law does it it makes life predictable or
[49:47] at least that's how they say it it
[49:48] should make life predictable again a
[49:51] really stupid example and the law makes
[49:54] life predictable because it says doesn't
[49:57] but if you own something that's
[50:01] yours and if somebody tries to take it
[50:04] from you then they can't in theory so
[50:08] you can start planning this is
[50:10] especially important in in financial
[50:14] matters and in property rights and all
[50:16] sorts of things like because if you do
[50:19] something a certain way you know this is
[50:21] how the system will react to it which
[50:23] makes it planable if we let laws in
[50:27] expire then that whole section of
[50:29] society suddenly becomes
[50:32] unplannable and I think that would be an
[50:34] undo burden on everyone and anyone I'm
[50:37] not saying that we shouldn't change the
[50:39] laws that we have that a more private
[50:41] focused law would be better or at least
[50:44] a choice in what laws you want to
[50:45] subject yourself to but just removing
[50:48] them no and this is one of the major
[50:50] criticisms that I hear which almost make
[50:52] me want to
[50:53] vomit like people calling
[50:57] um those people who are out there
[51:00] protesting for whatever reason
[51:02] destroying public property um hurting
[51:05] people injuring people that they're
[51:07] being called anarchists no they're not
[51:11] no they're not they're not anarchists
[51:14] Anarchy means no rulers it does not mean
[51:16] no rules what they mean is
[51:19] enemy very important distinction those
[51:22] are animists we hate animists
[51:27] so if you are an anarchist or a
[51:30] Libertarian you should be very much in
[51:32] favor of laws and rules in what form I
[51:35] don't know the current form not the best
[51:38] not having them at all or just letting
[51:40] them expire not so good either just my
[51:43] two
[51:45] cents yeah that's interesting I only
[51:47] after I mean I did not dig deep into
[51:50] that at all uh but I hear and see a lot
[51:54] that lws get outdated and they don't
[51:58] they don't get changed because nobody
[52:01] wants to change them or like they are
[52:03] just here and they're like as you said
[52:04] before it's the law uh but uh obviously
[52:08] in some fundamental things as you said
[52:11] before it will be really dangerous is
[52:13] laws all of the sudden expire uh without
[52:17] anything coming afterwards on the other
[52:20] hand and this is something I need to add
[52:22] um I don't think we should measure
[52:24] ourselves by the law
[52:27] we really shouldn't I have this one
[52:29] Professor right
[52:30] now um she's a she's she's a quirky
[52:34] woman she's quite quirky um she teaches
[52:38] um civil civil law in in in Switzerland
[52:42] you would call it Cil Gazette and she
[52:44] said something very interesting she said
[52:46] never forget never forget that the law
[52:51] is the lowest form of acceptable human
[52:55] behavior so
[52:57] yeah so if you ever encounter anyone we
[53:00] shouldn't say it's the law but at the
[53:02] same time we also shouldn't say well
[53:04] it's
[53:05] legal so if anyone comes to you and say
[53:08] yeah I did it but it's
[53:11] legal that immediately tells you all you
[53:13] need to know about that person because
[53:15] me as a as a I hope empathic modern
[53:20] human being I I think I can hold myself
[53:23] to a higher standard than the law
[53:27] I don't think I need to see where is
[53:29] where is that level where I can skirt
[53:32] closest to without getting punished just
[53:35] to get what I want I mean if I wanted
[53:37] that i' become a
[53:39] politician like no so we shouldn't say
[53:43] it's the law but we also just shouldn't
[53:44] say well it's legal I think we as
[53:46] bitcoiners if we want to set an example
[53:50] we should hold ourselves to a higher
[53:53] standard oh yeah it's really cool I
[53:57] never thought of that because I don't
[53:58] think a lot of about the law uh but the
[54:01] law is the lwest set of and and we
[54:04] should hold us human behavior yeah wow
[54:07] that's uh really cool I learned a lot
[54:09] today already um I have usually tine you
[54:13] know it where the previous guest is
[54:15] asking a question for the next guest um
[54:17] as I already asked that question uh I
[54:20] would just ask you now um what is your
[54:24] question for the next guest and I will
[54:26] answer and I will also give it to uh to
[54:28] the next uh uh person to answer so then
[54:32] we have still having that end routine if
[54:35] if Bitcoin gets adopted to the extent we
[54:39] see
[54:40] it what do you think will be the last
[54:43] Bastion of Fiat to fall which part of
[54:46] the Fiat system is the most resilient
[54:49] one I always ask myself that got
[54:52] different answers for
[54:53] it uh with passion you mean like uh
[54:57] different entities or institutions or
[55:00] will it be the government will it be the
[55:02] banking system what will be the last
[55:05] ones to insist that we use artificially
[55:09] created infinitely replicable
[55:13] paper as I think the banks are more
[55:16] practical and they
[55:19] um they can have easily a service also
[55:23] with
[55:24] Bitcoin and never thought of that it's a
[55:27] really interesting question um I think
[55:30] the government will be more likely to
[55:33] hold on to their fear currencies longer
[55:37] uh and resist longer uh and try to ex
[55:41] impose their rules and impose their
[55:44] power over people above Banks uh I mean
[55:48] there's also a difference between for me
[55:51] central banks and normal Bank branches
[55:56] um because central banks uh what what
[56:00] are they doing uh when when they don't
[56:04] have the Fiat systems uh so maybe
[56:07] central banks even above uh governments
[56:12] uh but I think the local banks and
[56:16] there's also like a lot of uh examples
[56:19] already there uh they are already
[56:21] embracing in some parts you mentioned
[56:23] the example of Switzerland there's
[56:25] examples in Germany with the folks Bank
[56:29] ra bank or something like that they
[56:32] embracing Bitcoins I think the the
[56:34] normal local Bank branches are well one
[56:38] of the first that Embrace Bitcoin and be
[56:40] like okay we can custody we can lend
[56:43] Bitcoin uh and governments and central
[56:46] banks on on the higher Elite level um
[56:49] are the ones that take a longer time
[56:53] what do you
[56:55] think make sense whoever is most
[56:57] involved so yeah it's a it's a good
[56:59] answer I received some really
[57:00] interesting answers to that question
[57:02] from others and maybe just not to
[57:04] influence as not to influence your next
[57:06] guest when we're done here I'll tell you
[57:07] what the most interesting answer was in
[57:09] terms of what will be the last Bastion
[57:11] of Fiat to fall perfect then uh let's
[57:14] leave it at that and yeah thank you for
[57:17] being on and thank you for uh doing that
[57:21] um yeah then I usually ask the last uh
[57:24] question uh where can people find you or
[57:27] where can people reach out to you if you
[57:29] want to um give some something where can
[57:32] people find you or even if you don't
[57:34] want to be it's also fine um if people
[57:38] want to message me um they can find me
[57:41] on the on the following email address
[57:43] that's
[57:44] BTC like Bitcoin at adverse
[57:49] doch that's where they find me I am on
[57:53] Twitter with quite a sizable following
[57:54] but I'm not giving out my hand handle
[57:57] one of the things so if somebody wants
[57:59] to ask me a direct question then they
[58:01] can find me on BTC at adverse with a
[58:06] V.C perfect and uh thank you for your
[58:08] time Mike byebye
