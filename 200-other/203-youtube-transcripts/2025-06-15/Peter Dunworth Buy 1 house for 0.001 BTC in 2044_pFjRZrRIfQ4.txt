[00:00] we go to bed we wake up one day and then
[00:01] we wake up to a a price of Bitcoin being
[00:04] set at a million dollar US it jumps 10x
[00:07] overnight and people are wondering well
[00:09] what just happened wall Street's got no
[00:10] idea what it's got itself in for they
[00:12] think they're going to control this
[00:13] Beast they don't understand that this is
[00:15] just a start of something that's going
[00:17] to completely redefine what Wall Street
[00:19] is how much is a home going to cost I
[00:20] wouldn't be surprised if it's 100,000
[00:22] Satoshi in 20 years time there is a
[00:23] market for 8 billion people that not
[00:25] only are going to want Bitcoin they're
[00:27] going to need Bitcoin this is where the
[00:29] information asymmetry plays in really
[00:30] nicely with your know bitcoiners is that
[00:32] we understand that everyone is going to
[00:34] need this at some point in time in the
[00:35] future the best risk versus reward the
[00:37] error of Bitcoin ever while larger pools
[00:40] of capital are accessing this Market you
[00:41] now have less and less Bitcoin available
[00:43] to purchase at some point in time we
[00:45] going to have this elastic band
[00:47] absolutely snap and then we'll see a god
[00:49] candle Bitcoin is the best form of
[00:51] collateral ever invented so you're going
[00:52] to get rewarded with the best loan terms
[00:54] the cheapest interest rate the best
[00:56] credit term and you'll be able to go to
[00:57] any Bank on Earth that's offering you
[00:59] those best terms
[01:04] before we start into the topic with real
[01:05] estate and why Bitcoin is such a great
[01:08] collateral um and how it Stacks up
[01:11] against Real Estate I want to just
[01:13] quickly ask you because it has been I
[01:16] think around half a year since our last
[01:18] conversation on the podcast what was
[01:20] like your your highlight in the past
[01:22] couple months I think five or six months
[01:24] it has been in the last five or six
[01:26] months I would say the Trojan Horse
[01:30] into Wall Street that is the ETF wall
[01:34] Street's got no idea what it's got
[01:35] itself in for they think they're going
[01:37] to control this Beast um they don't
[01:40] understand that this is just the start
[01:42] of something that's going to completely
[01:43] redefine what Wall Street is the
[01:45] products they've got how they operate
[01:48] and to me I can see the makings
[01:51] of one of the biggest if not the biggest
[01:54] Financial product on Earth with the ETFs
[01:57] and what that brings to the markets um
[01:59] if you understand the backing and the
[02:00] background of Larry thinkink and what he
[02:02] started with the tokenization of the
[02:05] real estate residential real estate
[02:07] market back in the early 80s more mid
[02:08] 80s with his uh Residential Mortgage
[02:11] back Securities um he effectively brings
[02:14] tokenization to money uh which he hasn't
[02:16] been able to achieve as yet obviously
[02:18] he's tokenized bonds he's you world's
[02:20] largest investor or fund manager but
[02:23] what he brings with Bitcoin and the the
[02:25] ability to tokenize that through the
[02:27] ETFs and then what that means from uh
[02:29] Downstream
[02:30] uh product perspective uh boy oh boy
[02:33] it's just open the floodgates but they
[02:35] don't know what they're in for yet but
[02:36] they're uh yeah they're really really
[02:39] interesting um yeah then let's directly
[02:41] jump into the topic um why do you think
[02:45] is Bitcoin such an pristine collateral
[02:48] uh and especially Stacks up against Real
[02:50] Estate so good it's it's a really deep
[02:52] question and I appreciate you having me
[02:54] on to talk about this the the real
[02:57] estate market has been a huge success
[03:00] for the last 40 or 50 years and you need
[03:02] to have a look at that in context to
[03:04] what has been achieved in the credit
[03:06] markets that have supported that and if
[03:09] you break down what makes a good
[03:10] investment in the real estate side of
[03:12] things um there's a whole host of
[03:14] factors that go into assessing whether
[03:16] or not a property deal is going to be a
[03:18] good one and the fundamental there are
[03:21] sort of some key drivers that move the
[03:23] market more so than anything else and if
[03:25] we take a really what what I going to
[03:28] suggest is we take a really high level
[03:29] and look at what are the key drivers for
[03:30] property and then we actually dig down
[03:32] into it and then see how that compares
[03:34] and relates to bitcoin because I think a
[03:37] lot of the the property developers
[03:39] property investors full stop don't
[03:41] really understand or comprehend the
[03:42] similar similarities that they that
[03:45] Bitcoin holds to the real estate sector
[03:47] and maybe doing a deep dive in
[03:49] comparison in that from all of the
[03:50] factors that we look at from a a real
[03:52] estate side of things and compare that
[03:54] to the Bitcoin side of things we we'll
[03:56] actually get those investors a whole lot
[03:58] closer to understanding you know what we
[04:00] see when it comes to bitcoin but if I
[04:03] make a start on a really high level the
[04:05] the first thing that the real estate
[04:06] sector does really well particularly in
[04:09] Western democracies is it affords people
[04:11] property rights so there's obviously
[04:13] without property rights we actually have
[04:15] no way of investing long-term capital so
[04:17] the provision of property rights is
[04:19] fundamental and it's it really is a
[04:22] given that we need to have uh property
[04:24] rights before we can actually invest any
[04:26] money in in in anywhere um to to look at
[04:29] this from high level perspective when
[04:30] we're looking at you know say the stock
[04:32] markets across the globe there are some
[04:35] stock markets that we just will not
[04:36] invest any money into because we're not
[04:39] concerned about a return on Capital
[04:41] we're we're more concerned about a
[04:43] return of capital and I sort of looked
[04:46] to the fact that we haven't invested in
[04:47] the Chinese market for a number of years
[04:50] um we we never got comfortable with the
[04:52] rule of law there and that that that's
[04:55] an instant dismissal from an investment
[04:57] decision if if you can't get comfortable
[04:59] with being able to not only get your
[05:00] money in you need to be able to get your
[05:02] money out when you want to as well and
[05:05] unfortunately it looks like the Chinese
[05:07] market is a one-way valve that it's okay
[05:09] to put money in but it's very difficult
[05:10] getting money out and this is where um
[05:13] on a real estate perspective U we want
[05:15] to invest in markets that not only allow
[05:17] us to put capital in but allow us the
[05:20] return of our Capital so I think
[05:22] property rights is a fundamental base
[05:24] layup of what we need to look to when
[05:26] we're looking at the comparison of of
[05:28] Bitcoin to to real estate and this is
[05:31] really interesting from a a real estate
[05:33] perspective all of our um economies that
[05:35] we work in and invest in have got very
[05:37] good property rights they've got Land
[05:39] Titles office they've got rules and
[05:41] regulations around that they've got very
[05:43] good guidance they've got great uh
[05:45] Clarity around who is the owner of the
[05:47] title of these Deeds that we need to
[05:50] actually invest and purchase those
[05:51] properties and it also shows the caveats
[05:53] and the loans the leans that are against
[05:55] those properties this is kind of a
[05:58] critical piece of infrastructure that we
[06:00] need to look at because it also shows
[06:02] the state of of the property and and
[06:04] what's what kind of Financial State
[06:06] that's
[06:07] in the interesting thing when you
[06:09] compare that to bitcoin is to me Bitcoin
[06:12] fundamentally exports those property
[06:14] rights to anyone who has access to the
[06:16] Bitcoin Network and that you're provided
[06:18] those those very same property rights
[06:20] that are outstanding and excellent that
[06:21] we you know want to invest in in say you
[06:24] know the US Europe Australia and the
[06:27] like um but that can be accessed with
[06:29] Bitcoin anywhere in the world and and I
[06:31] look at this and I think the property
[06:33] rights are afforded are basically given
[06:35] through I guess a number of different
[06:36] ways that is government policies
[06:39] incentives and tax breaks are there uh
[06:41] the abilities to take on subsidies or
[06:43] tax breaks for for making certain
[06:45] Investments and this is where a
[06:47] government can either promote or um
[06:51] discourage investment in a certain
[06:53] certain area now I look at um property
[06:56] investment in the US they've got
[06:58] opportunity zones where you know fairly
[07:01] uh rundown beat out areas of you know
[07:04] the city are basically afforded
[07:05] opportunity zones where you can invest
[07:07] money with discounted tax breaks and
[07:08] subsidies all sorts of incentives to
[07:11] clean up that area and and make
[07:13] investments
[07:14] there interestingly Bitcoin doesn't have
[07:17] that it's just a great opportunity for
[07:19] everyone but the the interesting thing
[07:22] about this is the government can
[07:23] influence decisions in these in these
[07:26] real estate decisions to try and either
[07:28] bring up the property Market or or
[07:29] alternatively push that property Market
[07:31] down so not only can offer incentives to
[07:34] do that they can offer disincentives by
[07:37] changing the zoning of a property that
[07:39] may be zoned for a 40 story commercial
[07:43] office block if they res Zone that to
[07:45] Parkland you've effectively taken away
[07:47] the intrinsic value of that property and
[07:49] so you are subject to the whim of that
[07:51] government as to whether or not they
[07:53] like you now it's a pretty rare
[07:55] occurrence in the western world that
[07:57] that happens but that's a very real
[07:59] problem that you need to be be aware of
[08:01] when when you're investing large sums
[08:03] it's really interesting also when we
[08:05] think about I never thought about that
[08:07] but when you think about tax treatments
[08:09] I know in Austria there are a lot of
[08:11] beneficial tax treatments from the
[08:13] government to real estate uh so like a
[08:17] lot of tax advisers even like hey if you
[08:18] have overflow cash flow put something in
[08:20] real estate do some deal with that that
[08:22] because there are a lot of incentives uh
[08:25] to just put money in real estate the
[08:27] government really incentivized that but
[08:29] what happen happens if the governments
[08:30] realizes hey we want as many Bitcoin as
[08:33] as possible in our country and put all
[08:35] those tax benefits that we formerly had
[08:38] on real estate now to the Bitcoin it's
[08:41] it's an interesting thought to to think
[08:43] about yeah the the interesting things I
[08:46] look at from an incentive structure that
[08:47] I'm aware of across the globe in
[08:50] Australia and I'm sure across a whole
[08:51] host of countries you've got incentive
[08:53] for first home buyers that they'll not
[08:55] only avoid um having to pay stamp Duty
[08:57] or on cost to purchase the property
[09:00] they will give you a cash handout to buy
[09:03] that and typically the banks will also
[09:05] give you a much higher uh percentage
[09:08] loan against a first home as opposed to
[09:12] a much higher value property so these
[09:14] are sort of the subtle cues that the
[09:16] government gives you that want you
[09:18] investing in that sort of investment and
[09:21] or or taking on that type of
[09:23] responsibility and this is where um
[09:25] there's also tax incentives there are
[09:27] huge tax incentives in the US that help
[09:29] your avoid capital gains tax uh 1031
[09:32] allows you to effectively leap frog from
[09:34] property property property property
[09:36] without having to pay capital gains tax
[09:38] along the way so you can leverage you
[09:40] know from one small property buy it hold
[09:42] it sell it reinvest that into the next
[09:44] property without having to pay capital
[09:46] gains tax and have your Investments
[09:48] diluted that's a huge incentive for
[09:51] anyone looking to build a a a a
[09:54] portfolio and build their wealth as
[09:55] quickly as possible because you avoid
[09:57] the capital gains tax which is typically
[09:59] somewhere between 20 to 40% across
[10:02] across the globe imagine every 5 years
[10:05] you had your wealth tax by 40% because
[10:07] you had to pay capital gains tax now
[10:10] that 1031 in the US is a huge benefit to
[10:13] anyone who's looking to take advantage
[10:14] of that because not only do you get to
[10:16] leverage the property by borrowing on
[10:18] the property in credit and we'll get to
[10:19] you know how that affects real estate
[10:21] Investments but you also get to leverage
[10:23] the fact that you're not going to pay
[10:24] capital gains tax and you can defer well
[10:27] you're going to pay it but you're going
[10:28] to defer it and you get to keep
[10:30] deferring that the whole way along the
[10:31] way until you come to the end of your
[10:33] run and and need to sell the property
[10:35] and don't want to reinvest it in that so
[10:37] there are so many um levers that the
[10:40] government can pull to incentivize
[10:43] property and I look at this and I think
[10:46] this is what what our Western
[10:48] democracies are effectively built on is
[10:50] really good property rights and the
[10:52] governments have highly incentivized us
[10:55] to invest in property whether that's
[10:57] through tax break subsidies cash backs
[11:00] tax incentives um or a whole host of
[11:03] other measures and one of the things
[11:04] that you know a lot of Australian
[11:06] investors do and um I'm sure it's
[11:08] available to you know most of Europe and
[11:10] the US is uh negative gearing in that if
[11:13] you buy a property and you heavily gear
[11:15] that property or you borrow heavily on
[11:18] that property and the rent doesn't meet
[11:20] the repayment um that difference plus
[11:23] whatever other costs are incurred in
[11:24] holding that property for the year um
[11:27] are allowed to be deducted from your tax
[11:29] ible income so all of a sudden it's
[11:32] highly it incentivizes you highly to
[11:34] take on debt to be negatively geared and
[11:38] have that property costing you money
[11:40] because it comes straight off your
[11:41] taxable income you use that as a tax
[11:43] deduction and then at the same time
[11:45] you've got the Capital Growth of the
[11:47] property going up at the same time and
[11:50] that's why a lot of property investors
[11:52] get fabulously wealthy because you have
[11:55] the ability to minimize your income tax
[11:57] which is typically tax at 50% % for the
[12:00] highest income
[12:01] taxpayers and you get to put your your
[12:05] gains your returns into the Capital
[12:06] Growth of the property which is taxed at
[12:08] 25% so from an Investor's perspective
[12:11] and this is where you need to look at
[12:12] Total return do you want to be taxed at
[12:15] 25% and have the ability to defer that
[12:18] tax basically add infin item into the
[12:21] future never never put it on the Never
[12:22] Never account that you never really pay
[12:24] it or do you want to pay 50% of your
[12:27] income every year trying to get ah hit
[12:30] and this is where to me property has
[12:33] worked really well for that perspective
[12:35] and I think Bitcoin has the ability to
[12:37] work even better when you look at it in
[12:39] the broader context of what makes a good
[12:42] real estate investment and you compare
[12:43] apples to apples on that front yeah this
[12:46] was my my next question do you think
[12:48] that same Playbook maybe also with dep
[12:51] as Bitcoin as collateral and you get
[12:53] like a fat adapt on that is the same
[12:55] Playbook also suitable for for Bitcoin I
[12:58] mean the only difference that I see is
[13:00] real estate has an income you have
[13:02] rental in there uh nobody can live in
[13:06] the Bitcoin but it's way better as an
[13:08] asset itself so uh kind of like it's
[13:11] probably better I think it's really
[13:13] important to understand what makes a
[13:15] good property investment and the the
[13:18] thing that we look at you know beyond
[13:19] property rights that makes a good
[13:21] property investment we want to make sure
[13:22] that there is a demographic trend
[13:24] heading to that area that we're looking
[13:26] to invest in so is there a flow of
[13:28] people that are going to come to the
[13:30] area that are going to build out
[13:32] infrastructure that are going to build
[13:33] out amenities Employments you know all
[13:36] of these sort of X factors that are very
[13:38] difficult to determine but if you
[13:40] understand what you're looking at you
[13:41] know you can identify those things I I
[13:44] look at that and compare that to the
[13:46] relative opportunity with Bitcoin and I
[13:49] think property is very well understood
[13:51] it's very easy to calculate and we can
[13:54] we can see what demographics are headed
[13:56] to certain areas so we can determine
[13:59] pretty well what the capital growth of
[14:01] certain areas are going to be relative
[14:02] to others and then we could make a
[14:05] calculated I guess guess or assumptions
[14:07] about what are going to be the return
[14:09] and the risk profile of of that
[14:12] investment what's interesting I see
[14:14] about Bitcoin is that what a lot of
[14:16] people don't really understand is that I
[14:19] I feel that there is there there is a
[14:21] market for 8 billion people that not
[14:24] only are going to want Bitcoin they're
[14:26] going to need Bitcoin and when you put
[14:29] this in you know in real estate terms
[14:31] what what does that actually equate to
[14:33] well there's 21 million Bitcoin and
[14:35] there's 8 billion
[14:37] people so what that effectively
[14:40] represents if we were talking about an
[14:42] area um like a a property a a land deal
[14:46] there are 21 million acres and every
[14:49] single person on Earth if they were
[14:51] given an equal share would have roughly
[14:53] 3 square m of space now I look at that
[14:56] and think if I know there are going to
[14:58] be eight 8 billion people that are vying
[15:01] for this piece of land that's magical
[15:03] that everyone is going to need it's not
[15:05] it's not a want it's not a nice to have
[15:07] they're going to have to have it they
[15:09] just don't know it yet and there's
[15:11] roughly three square meters for every
[15:13] person I look at this and think well
[15:16] that's the kind of property investment
[15:17] that I want to be making and this is
[15:19] where the information asymmetry plays in
[15:22] really nicely with you know bitcoiners
[15:24] is that we understand that everyone is
[15:26] going to need this at some point in time
[15:27] in the future but not every real estate
[15:30] owner um developer or investor
[15:34] understands the the requirement that
[15:36] they going to need this in the future
[15:38] and there in lies the opportunity that
[15:40] once the rest of the world figures out
[15:41] what this is they're going to need to
[15:44] effectively buy as much of this as they
[15:46] can and the problem with this is unlike
[15:48] any other piece of land in the world is
[15:51] there's only 21 million Acres there's
[15:53] only 21 million Bitcoin we can't produce
[15:55] any more of that it is a it is a hard
[15:57] cap on 21 million
[15:59] so regardless of how hard people try
[16:02] there's no ability for us to either
[16:06] build a second layer on top of this
[16:08] there's and I say that as far as in in
[16:11] terms of you know land acquisition um
[16:14] there's no ability for us to reclaim
[16:15] land in the in the harbor like Hong Kong
[16:18] did to build out a Runway um there's no
[16:21] ability for us to drive piles of sand
[16:23] into the ocean like Dubai did to build
[16:25] the Palms we're set we're stuck that's
[16:28] 21 million or 21 million Bitcoin and
[16:30] that is it we can't go up we can't build
[16:33] on top of it it's just going to be flat
[16:34] land so think of trying to fit 8 billion
[16:37] people into that 21 21 million Acres
[16:42] basically we have three square meters
[16:44] each and and the real thing about this
[16:46] which sort of just it it beggers belief
[16:49] and still find it hard to process is
[16:51] that we can go and buy that three square
[16:54] meters that one Bitcoin now for circa
[16:57] $60,000
[16:59] and I know there's going to be 8 billion
[17:01] people on that plot of land in the next
[17:03] 20 years that's amazing and I think we
[17:06] saw we see this trend already starting I
[17:09] had in the last three weeks uh two
[17:12] people on uh that were formerly Real
[17:14] Estate Investors and now shifted the
[17:17] last uh what was it two and a half years
[17:19] all the properties into Bitcoin they're
[17:21] like we we don't want it it's a headache
[17:23] uh it's it's you have to care for it
[17:25] there's like a toilet not working you
[17:27] have to care for that like there's like
[17:29] a lot of headach coming with real estate
[17:30] and they want to have the Best
[17:32] Collateral and it's really interesting
[17:34] uh how you how you explain it because
[17:36] once you like understand or everyone
[17:39] needs to have Bitcoin at some point it's
[17:41] like it's like the world will be forced
[17:44] to live in an area and you can now buy a
[17:47] piece of that area and you know 8
[17:49] billion people maybe more at that time
[17:52] maybe we get make more babies and more
[17:54] people maybe we even uh get get to space
[17:58] and and and find new speeches but that's
[18:00] that's another topic uh and they all
[18:02] want to live in that area and they all
[18:04] want the piece of that that's uh that's
[18:07] um amazing opportunity to to have now to
[18:11] get like a million subs for a few uh
[18:15] what is it million SS thousand EUR not
[18:17] even thousand EUR so like that's an
[18:20] amazing opportunity to have and it's
[18:22] it's really really great to to have that
[18:24] and now um with with the Playbook of
[18:27] real estate do you think uh people will
[18:29] um start loaning uh lending out their
[18:32] Bitcoin as collateral to to make that
[18:34] play and and pay for things because as
[18:36] as you said like if you sell your
[18:38] Bitcoin or you spend your Bitcoin right
[18:40] now there's a lot of taxes involved in
[18:43] in most of the areas of of of the world
[18:45] some some don't have taxes some have
[18:47] taxes on that um is the best strategy
[18:50] just like get like I don't know uh one10
[18:54] of your Bitcoin take it as collateral
[18:56] and and get a US dollar loan or Euro
[18:59] loan or whatever loan uh to pay pay for
[19:02] your bills and don't have to sell your
[19:04] Bitcoin as everyone wants to live there
[19:06] without wanting to give any personal
[19:07] financial advice I find it very
[19:09] difficult selling Bitcoin knowing full
[19:11] well that there's 8 billion people about
[19:13] to head into this piece of land that and
[19:15] they're going to want they're going to
[19:16] want to buy it and they're going to
[19:17] they're going to pay a premium for it
[19:20] and for me when it comes to offering
[19:22] Bitcoin up as collateral if we take a
[19:25] step back on this and and look at the
[19:28] real EST State Market over the last 40
[19:30] or 50 years particularly across any any
[19:32] of um the Western countries has seen
[19:35] unprecedented growth and the reason for
[19:38] that there's multiple different reasons
[19:40] for that and but if I go through it the
[19:43] major reason um obviously is the the the
[19:46] ability to to purchase there were
[19:48] demographics behind it so there were
[19:50] people there who wanted wanted to buy
[19:51] land build families and you know our
[19:53] population grew that's the first one the
[19:55] second one is that there was an
[19:58] availability of credit and this is
[20:00] something that I don't think people
[20:02] really comprehend was the reason why
[20:04] we've had such a huge boom in property
[20:07] and when you couple that um the the
[20:10] credit policies that have changed over
[20:11] the last 50 years and I'll run through a
[20:13] couple of examples of that um and how
[20:16] that has has been um how that's had
[20:19] Tailwinds of basically interest rates
[20:21] going down for the last 40 years that
[20:24] has been a perfect storm to push the
[20:26] value of that of that ceral I.E the real
[20:29] estate property market up substantially
[20:32] and just to give you an example of how
[20:34] much credit has influenced um these
[20:37] property prices over the last 40 years
[20:40] uh I I just want to give you an example
[20:41] of what property used to or property
[20:44] credit on property used to look like
[20:46] back in the 1970s versus what it looks
[20:49] like today so if you were uh wanting to
[20:51] go and purchase a new home back in the
[20:54] 1970s you had to come up with roughly
[20:57] 50% of the deposit osit so you had to
[21:00] save you know for a number of years to
[21:03] come up with that deposit and then you
[21:05] would go to the bank and they would
[21:07] assess you on whether or not you were
[21:09] capable of purchasing that now interest
[21:12] rates were far higher than what they are
[21:14] now and the other interesting thing is
[21:17] is that this was at at a time um when
[21:21] the introduction and I I don't want to
[21:24] um sound narrow-minded or myopic in this
[21:26] but um you know women in the Workforce
[21:29] was a relatively new thing um it had
[21:32] only been around for say 15 to 20 years
[21:35] um on the back of you know the expansion
[21:37] the 6 50s and 60s of women entering the
[21:39] workforce and what was interesting about
[21:41] the credit policies is that they were
[21:43] very um they were they were very um
[21:47] dismissive of women wanting to take out
[21:49] loans and if you were a single woman
[21:51] wanting to borrow to buy a property a
[21:53] lot of the time you were knocked back
[21:56] because they they were they were very
[21:58] unfair policies they just Flatout
[22:00] refused to give women loans because they
[22:02] didn't want to take the risk because
[22:04] they thought that they would be
[22:06] unreliable in pain and they'd want to
[22:08] start a family and then they wouldn't be
[22:09] able to meet their commitment so that's
[22:11] where we were 40 50 years ago things
[22:14] have changed dramatically from then
[22:17] until now in that now all you have to do
[22:20] to buy property in Australia anyway is
[22:21] come up with 5% of the value of the
[22:24] property so you need to come up with now
[22:29] 10% of what you used to come up with
[22:32] back in the 1970s so you only come up
[22:35] with a small fraction of what you need
[22:37] and then you borrow
[22:39] 95% so what does that do all of a sudden
[22:42] just by default that is going to raise
[22:44] the prices of property dramatically
[22:46] because now all of a sudden a whole host
[22:49] of people can actually save enough money
[22:51] to go and buy property now the other
[22:54] sort of fuel of the fire on this one is
[22:56] is that when you take interest rates
[22:57] from 18 % down to
[22:59] 0% all of a sudden you now make that
[23:03] cost of that 95% loan on the property
[23:06] effectively nothing relative to what
[23:08] that is so what does that do the
[23:10] lowering of interest rates effectively
[23:12] you know pushes puts a a bonfire under
[23:14] the the value of the property and
[23:16] basically forces the property up
[23:17] dramatically in value and just like
[23:19] we're starting to see now where we've
[23:22] now seen for the first time in 40 years
[23:24] interest rates actually start to go up
[23:25] over the last two years we've seen a
[23:27] flattening out relative in the property
[23:30] market so I look at that and
[23:33] think
[23:35] Bitcoin has all of these things to look
[23:37] forward to when it comes to Tailwinds
[23:40] collateral all of these things are going
[23:42] to be coming to bitcoin and I look at
[23:44] this as an investing opportunity that
[23:45] we're going to have Bitcoin treated as
[23:47] the best form of collateral so for the
[23:50] last 50 years we've seen residential
[23:51] property and property in general treated
[23:54] as the best form of collateral and what
[23:56] does that
[23:56] meant if you had the best form of
[23:59] collateral you got the cheapest interest
[24:01] rates you got to borrow the most against
[24:03] any other relative to any other asset
[24:05] you got the most preferable loan terms
[24:08] and what that meant was that you can
[24:09] basically pour more money into it and
[24:11] you can hold on to equity so you could
[24:13] then go and buy another property and I
[24:15] look at this and I think um with a
[24:17] background in credit and looking at
[24:21] how Bitcoin rates relative to property
[24:25] residential or commercial in terms of a
[24:27] collateral I look at this and think
[24:29] Bitcoin is hands down infinitely better
[24:33] than the collateral that we've got in
[24:35] residential property and commercial
[24:37] property but that is misunderstood by
[24:40] the markets and this is why when you ask
[24:41] me to start um the conversation what are
[24:44] you excited about this is where the
[24:46] Trojan horses ended Wall Street and
[24:49] these products are coming to market now
[24:51] Larry was instrumental in getting the
[24:53] tokenization of the residential property
[24:55] Market in the form of the Residential
[24:56] Mortgage back securities and I think
[24:59] he's going to redo that Playbook with
[25:02] Bitcoin through the ETFs is that all
[25:05] maybe I'm living in a bubble but I hear
[25:07] so many great news about Bitcoin and
[25:09] maybe that there's like some such a
[25:11] storm now coming like we have all the
[25:13] buckets already out for Bitcoin there's
[25:15] like the the playbook for uh
[25:17] corporations laid out by micro strategy
[25:20] a lot already followed we have the
[25:22] playbook for even nation states with
[25:24] with El Salvador even though they have
[25:25] only a small Bitcoin Reserve with like I
[25:28] don't know four or five% of their
[25:29] reserves but still they have uh then we
[25:32] have like real estate playbooks where
[25:35] they come we have the ETFs with all
[25:37] those different fundamental buckets that
[25:39] are already laid out and it seems like
[25:41] we are uh in for like um a Gold Rush era
[25:45] for for Bitcoin the next like couple 10
[25:48] 20 years where where it's probably not
[25:51] only going up but there like there will
[25:53] be boom and bus cycles of course along
[25:55] the way and volatility I guess um but
[25:58] the do you think that we are now in that
[26:00] area where it's so obvious but 99% of
[26:03] the people still don't get it and and
[26:05] like right now I feel like it's the the
[26:07] best risk uh versus reward era of
[26:11] Bitcoin ever uh because it's already so
[26:14] obvious it's it's always soen and we
[26:16] have still so much growth in front of us
[26:18] I agree with that wholeheartedly they on
[26:21] a risk adjusted basis I've never seen a
[26:23] better time to be investing in Bitcoin
[26:25] because you now have a lot of the
[26:27] downside risk protected you now have
[26:30] regulatory Authority in the form of SEC
[26:33] approval and whether we like it or not
[26:36] the SEC sets the agenda for the world so
[26:38] you in Europe myself in Australia we're
[26:40] just we're minions relative to the US
[26:43] and what they determine so they've
[26:44] already given their their stamp of
[26:46] approval to ensure that there is going
[26:48] to be regulatory Clarity on that that's
[26:50] a huge step forward I look at um on a
[26:53] risk adjusted basis Bitcoin trading at
[26:56] $60,000 it's such a consequential Market
[26:59] in global terms of 1.1 to$ 1.2 trillion
[27:03] there's you know1 trillion of funds
[27:05] under advice globally that needs to
[27:07] enter this Market in some way shape or
[27:09] form it's
[27:11] now got the regulatory approval which
[27:13] now allows larger pools of capital to
[27:15] put put money to work and while larger
[27:18] pools of capital are accessing this
[27:20] Market you now have less and less
[27:21] Bitcoin available to purchase so at some
[27:24] point in time we are going to have this
[27:26] elastic ban absolutely snap and then
[27:29] we'll see a god candle a mega candle
[27:31] whatever you want to call it at some
[27:32] point in time but to your point about
[27:35] the the playbooks have all been laid out
[27:37] Michael sailor has been instrumental and
[27:38] what he's done is absolutely genius from
[27:41] a from a from a business perspective
[27:43] he's effectively created a money
[27:45] printing machine in the form of issuing
[27:47] shares to go and buy Bitcoin and
[27:50] although he he dilutes his shareholders
[27:52] by in terms of units of his company it
[27:56] is actually a creative in Bitcoin to
[27:59] each of those those unit holders so it
[28:02] is an absolutely fabulous Playbook the
[28:04] best part is is that he gets to
[28:05] Arbitrage that risk to the upside when
[28:07] that bitcoin's well when his stock is
[28:10] trading at a premium to the book value
[28:12] that he believes it is he can issue
[28:13] shares to bring that back down to fair
[28:16] market value and then if for whatever
[28:19] reason his stock is trading at a
[28:20] discount relative to Market he then gets
[28:24] to issue convertible bonds so Tails he
[28:27] wins loses like you know tals he wins
[28:29] heads he wins it's like he just has
[28:31] found a way to do what Charlie Sheen did
[28:33] in by winning like he can't lose with
[28:35] that strategy um don't want to give him
[28:37] the kiss of death but it's an
[28:39] outstanding strategy that I look at and
[28:41] think why aren't more people doing it
[28:43] we've seen metap planet in Japan and um
[28:46] similar scientific um you know pick up
[28:48] the the Baton and run with it but these
[28:51] are great ideas that take a huge amount
[28:54] of understanding and learning before it
[28:56] can be implemented and are so many
[28:58] hurdles to overcoming that that good
[29:00] ideas really need to be rammed down
[29:02] people's throats you know Michael saor
[29:05] was terrified that when he figured out
[29:07] what Bitcoin was that someone was going
[29:09] to beat him to it so he spent basically
[29:12] three days buying $3,000 lots of Bitcoin
[29:15] to to get his you know 1002 200 $300
[29:19] million position initial position in
[29:21] Bitcoin and he was terrified that
[29:23] someone would beat him to it and just
[29:24] put a lumpsum order in and then set the
[29:26] price at whatever the price would be and
[29:30] and this is where despite all this
[29:32] groundwork being done and the playbooks
[29:33] being out there whether it's a real
[29:35] estate you know stock market bond market
[29:39] you name it it's all out there but there
[29:41] are going to be very few people who
[29:42] actually pick it up and run with it and
[29:44] it's just going to be a late a late
[29:46] start for a lot of people and the crowd
[29:48] will be late to this if you watch or
[29:50] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[29:53] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[29:56] and now the most important step is to
[29:58] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[30:01] hardware wallet my personal
[30:03] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[30:05] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[30:07] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[30:09] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[30:12] exchange and you can get a 5% discount

[30:58] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[31:01] secure sovereign individual in general
[31:05] and last but not least I have something
[31:07] completely new for you guys I partnered
[31:10] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[31:14] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:16] saw created by anyone look at that
[31:19] beauty I love it so much coin Vigilant
[31:22] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[31:25] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[31:28] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[31:31] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[31:34] make sure to check out the link in the
[31:36] description for this amazing coin
[31:38] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[31:41] amazing I love them so much it was
[31:43] really hard for me to pick the one that
[31:45] I want to have because there are a lot
[31:47] of great options I went with the new
[31:50] transparency Edition they are all
[31:52] limited so grab yours those will not be
[31:55] available for a long time but there will
[31:57] come new models and new amazing designs
[32:00] along the way yeah it's I love the
[32:02] comparison he made in in the podcast
[32:05] with me uh a couple months ago where he
[32:08] said like if you have to cure for cancer
[32:10] you still have to sell it like people
[32:13] are uh skeptical at first even if you if
[32:16] you have someone that has cancer and you
[32:18] have the cure for cancer it will still
[32:20] take them time to like oh but does it
[32:22] really cure my cancer or does it is it
[32:25] what about the side effects oh can can I
[32:27] can afford it like all those questions
[32:29] in the head and it's like H we have this
[32:33] pristine collateral we have this amazing
[32:35] asset with Bitcoin and it's once you
[32:37] dive deeper in it it's it's so obvious
[32:40] uh yeah like you never meet an informed
[32:42] critic that actually has no Bitcoin
[32:44] there are some informed critics who have
[32:46] like five 10% of Bitcoin because even
[32:49] the critics are like oh that there might
[32:51] be a chance it catches on like like even
[32:53] the the the the I think even like people
[32:56] like Peter shiff I think even he has
[32:58] some Bitcoin I think there's no way he
[33:00] has no Bitcoin like at least some he has
[33:02] to get because he's seen how how wrong
[33:05] he was since Bitcoin was like $2 so like
[33:07] there's no way he has no Bitcoin uh so
[33:10] that's an that's an amazing thing and
[33:12] there's no one shorting it long term
[33:15] that is successful because they would be
[33:16] bankrupt till now uh so it's an really
[33:19] interesting uh topic and I want to I
[33:22] yeah go ahead I was going to say to that
[33:24] analogy about you can't sell a que can
[33:26] like you can't give away Cur of cancer
[33:28] you've got to sell it you know who are
[33:30] the people who are buying that Cur of
[33:32] cancer and aren't asking questions the
[33:34] people who need
[33:35] it in the same way that the people who
[33:38] need Bitcoin will just buy it and
[33:39] they're not going to ask questions they
[33:42] and and the sad part is is that the
[33:44] people who need Bitcoin there are 8
[33:47] billion people who need it but maybe a
[33:49] million people understand that they
[33:50] actually need it so I know there's going
[33:54] to be 8 billion people who need it um
[33:56] just like that cure for cancer but it's
[33:58] not until you need it that you are going
[34:00] to take action to actually understand it
[34:02] and then take Massive Action to to
[34:04] implement this across whatever you know
[34:06] whatever assets you've got to deploy
[34:09] into this space so I find that highly
[34:11] amusing that the cure for cancer is only
[34:14] sold to the person who needs it not
[34:15] wants it oh yeah I'm skeptical I don't
[34:17] believe it cures cancer and you know
[34:19] whatever but if you've got cancer and
[34:21] you've got someone telling you you've
[34:22] got a cure for it you're not asking what
[34:24] the side effects are you're not asking
[34:26] how much it costs you're just saying
[34:27] just give me the
[34:29] thing that's that's actually true yeah
[34:32] it's interesting for me because like
[34:34] when I go into the gym I see mostly fit
[34:37] people when when you go to a car wash
[34:40] there are usually cars that are already
[34:43] quite good like they don't have to be in
[34:44] a car wash like people that regular go
[34:46] to the car wash they have a clean car uh
[34:49] so like there there's this thing and and
[34:51] also in in my uh friendships where I see
[34:56] no coiners who adopt the Bitcoin is a
[34:58] most mostly people that don't really
[35:00] need it right now they they they live a
[35:02] good life and uh they they not the ones
[35:05] that are suffering financially right now
[35:07] uh but they are the ones who adopt it so
[35:09] it's interesting that like um and people
[35:12] that uh only live on feia they live
[35:14] month to month uh the the people that
[35:16] needed the most or even like people in
[35:18] in Africa I mean we have in Nigeria the
[35:20] highest adoption rates so like that's
[35:23] that's like a little bit against that
[35:24] but uh I think people who who needed
[35:27] really uh in in in countries like
[35:30] Nigeria or Salvador they adopted but
[35:33] then there are this this this middle
[35:35] glass who doesn't doesn't see the pain
[35:38] the they will experience really soon and
[35:40] they would need it uh um the most and
[35:43] they would benefit from it also the most
[35:46] like the small companies the the the
[35:49] individuals who have a little bit of
[35:50] cash uh on the hands like maybe they
[35:52] have like 20,000 EUR laying around they
[35:55] would probably benefit the most from it
[35:58] uh when adopting them and this is also
[36:00] like the the biggest part and the
[36:02] biggest chunk of that like Bitcoin is
[36:04] either get by people who actually do a
[36:06] lot of research in finance or by the
[36:08] people who already are in pain uh like
[36:12] in Nigeria in El Salvador and all those
[36:14] places it's it's it's fascinating to see
[36:17] the the adoption running but we are
[36:19] still at like so early and there was one
[36:21] guy I think he's all I think he's also
[36:24] on the Bitcoin Advisory Board I forgot
[36:27] his name I'm I'm he was two times
[36:29] already on my podcast I'm so
[36:32] embarrassed
[36:34] wait uh oh I forgot his name in
[36:39] real estate he's big uh Le wank h no I'm
[36:44] sorry I will think about it a little bit
[36:46] later but he basically said he thinks
[36:48] that even at a million dooll bitcoin
[36:51] price 90% of people will still don't get
[36:54] it and 90% will still don't have uh uh
[36:58] got Bitcoin but it will be already at a
[37:00] million dollars because the big money
[37:02] will will come in uh do you also see the
[37:05] the point where the people with they
[37:08] have already uh then all all of the
[37:11] sudden they get canc all of the sudden
[37:12] they need Bitcoin when is that moment of
[37:15] like Mass retail foral coming is it like
[37:18] past a million like what more do do the
[37:22] the masses need as a as a bitcoin price
[37:24] as as an action or an event that happens
[37:26] doesn't has to be in prise maybe it's an
[37:28] event that happens that people are like
[37:30] oh now we have to adop bitcoin I I
[37:33] think it's a I think it's a government
[37:35] scale event it's not a it's not a
[37:37] bottomup mass Awakening where people you
[37:40] know a million people wake up and say
[37:42] hey I've got to buy a million dollars of
[37:44] it and just jams the price up I think we
[37:47] end up we we go to bed we wake up one
[37:50] day and then we wake up to a a price of
[37:53] Bitcoin being set at a million dollar US
[37:56] it jumps 10 next overnight and people
[37:59] are wondering well what just happened
[38:01] it's like well a central Banker with uh
[38:03] an ability to print money by literally
[38:05] holding his finger on the Zero key has
[38:08] the ability to buy an unlimited amount
[38:09] of Bitcoin or whatever is on the
[38:11] exchange and the funny thing about this
[38:13] is is this this is the money glitch they
[38:16] have a zero cost of production for their
[38:19] money and currently Bitcoin cost roughly
[38:23] $52,000 per Bitcoin to produce now I'm
[38:27] no Trader but if I'm a central banker
[38:29] and realize that hey that costs $52,000
[38:32] worth of electricity and all-in cost to
[38:34] produce and I can print $52,000 for
[38:37] nothing a very smart Central Banker
[38:40] forward thinker is going to say you know
[38:42] what I'm just going to hold my money you
[38:44] know my finger down on the money printer
[38:45] I'm going to print as much of this as I
[38:47] can and I'm just going to buy and keep
[38:49] buying until people get exhausted of
[38:51] selling and then what will happen is the
[38:53] price will just continue to move up
[38:55] it'll get to a level that they they're
[38:57] going to continue to buy it and that
[38:59] sets the foundation of a new floor I've
[39:01] got no doubt that will happen we're not
[39:03] going to have a mass Awakening of a
[39:04] billion people who say hey we've got to
[39:06] have it and they go to you know their
[39:08] exchange one day and buy it and send it
[39:09] to the top that's not how this is going
[39:11] to work this is going to work from a top
[39:13] down someone with a money printer is
[39:14] just going to say you know what I've
[39:16] seen the Playbook I've seen the best
[39:18] performing you know asset on on Earth
[39:20] for the last 15 years is Bitcoin I've
[39:22] seen the best performing stock in the
[39:23] last four years is micro strategy I'm
[39:25] going to buy some of that and I'm going
[39:27] to put my country is the first country
[39:28] that holds holds as much Bitcoin as
[39:31] possible that's how it works in in my
[39:33] mind and
[39:34] then for me how this is going to play
[39:38] out in the long term is when people
[39:40] understand that this is the best form of
[39:41] collateral ever invented you're going to
[39:43] be able to take this collateral to any
[39:47] Bank on Earth and I look at this and I
[39:49] think we've got or had experience with
[39:53] clients in the past particularly in the
[39:55] early '90s I was a bit too young for
[39:56] this but heard the stories um on the
[39:58] back of this in the early '90s in
[40:00] Australia we had interest rates around
[40:04] 18% but you could go and get a foreign
[40:07] exchange loan with Singapore or
[40:09] Switzerland where you would pay 12 to
[40:11] 133% so you were reducing your interest
[40:14] payable by roughly 30% by taking out a
[40:17] loan with another foreign bank now the
[40:20] problem with that is is that you had an
[40:21] exchange rate risk that if the US dollar
[40:25] dropped in val or the Aussie dollar
[40:26] dropped in value relative to that
[40:28] currency that you bought in or that
[40:30] you'd borrowed in then you had to make
[40:33] up the difference and a lot of people
[40:35] got caught out and ended up going bus
[40:37] because they exposed themselves to a
[40:38] foreign currency that they they didn't
[40:41] understand the risk of now they were
[40:43] trying to save 5% on their mortgage
[40:46] repayment um and they ended up going
[40:49] broke because of the foreign exchange
[40:50] rate risk associated with this now the
[40:53] reason why I bring that up is because
[40:54] Bitcoin as a globally ubiquitous
[40:57] pristine
[40:58] collateral allows you to go to any Bank
[41:01] on Earth will want to take the
[41:03] underlying asset that is Bitcoin now
[41:05] ironically they're not going to want to
[41:06] take the underlying asset of an ETF
[41:09] because the ETF comes with all the
[41:11] incumbrances of whatever country that
[41:14] it's listed in so you're not going to be
[41:16] able to take your uh ibit you know Black
[41:20] Rock ETF Bitcoin to The Reserve Bank of
[41:23] Japan because they're going to look at
[41:24] you and say what good is this to us we
[41:27] we can't use this because it's got the
[41:29] encumbrance of encumbrances of being
[41:31] listed on the NASDAQ it's got all of the
[41:35] problems associated with you know the US
[41:38] Securities Law that they have to deal
[41:40] with and there's no way for them to hold
[41:42] it and have any control over it when you
[41:44] pair that with having the underlying
[41:47] you'll be able to go to the bank of
[41:48] Japan and say hey I've got a Bitcoin
[41:51] it's globally ubiquitous so it's the
[41:52] same all over the world they'll look at
[41:54] that and say yeah I'll I'll take that
[41:57] I'd like that and they'll give you a
[41:59] rate that's lower than anywhere else on
[42:01] Earth that you can borrow from that's at
[42:03] this point in time and so I look at this
[42:06] and think you don't have you've got the
[42:07] ability to get the best terms when you
[42:09] have the best Best Collateral and
[42:11] Bitcoin is the best form of collateral
[42:13] ever invented so you're going to get
[42:15] rewarded with the best loan terms the
[42:17] cheapest interest rate the best credit
[42:19] terms and you'll be able to go to any
[42:21] Bank on Earth that's offering you those
[42:23] best terms because it's ubiquitous all
[42:26] over Globe so it's the same everywhere
[42:28] you go but if I turned up to say an
[42:31] Austrian bank with an Australian title
[42:34] de for my property you boys are going to
[42:37] laugh me out of the bank it's like what
[42:40] on Earth do we want your Australian
[42:41] title Dee it may as well be a tissue or
[42:43] a toilet paper that means the same thing
[42:45] in Austria but if I turned up to an
[42:47] Austrian bank with a Bitcoin that's
[42:50] completely different and this is where
[42:52] you having seen experiences with clients
[42:54] who have suffered that foreign exchange
[42:56] risk in their Bing in in an attempt to
[42:58] get a lower interest rate by taking on
[43:00] foreign currency risk the ironic thing
[43:03] about using Bitcoin is collateral is
[43:05] that you get to experience the best
[43:07] interest rates on the best terms and you
[43:10] preclude yourself from ever having any
[43:13] foreign currency risk in the borrowing
[43:14] that you take on because you've got one
[43:16] asset in Bitcoin that's denominated in
[43:18] every currency on Earth that's super
[43:20] interesting the global aspect of it
[43:22] because you just take it everywhere I
[43:24] think in Austria a friend of mine told
[43:26] me you don't even have to give them the
[43:28] Bitcoin to get a loan you just have to
[43:30] give them your your public keys and they
[43:33] they are fine with that
[43:35] apparently please send them my details
[43:38] I'd like to talk to
[43:40] them yeah see if there's public here but
[43:43] probably you have to somehow prove that
[43:45] you also have the private key but uh
[43:48] yeah I have to check it out once uh as
[43:50] I'm I'm in Austria I have to see I I
[43:53] came up with the name ret Sony uh sorry
[44:00] he was already two times on my show I
[44:02] was also one time on on his show it's
[44:04] it's really cool uh talking with him
[44:06] every time um I want to ccle I want to
[44:09] Circle back one time more to to real
[44:12] estate uh because one aspect that we did
[44:15] not cover till now is and I think a lot
[44:17] of people are not aware or don't think
[44:19] about that uh that aspect of it real
[44:21] estate is already crashing really hard
[44:24] against Bitcoin like you can uh when you
[44:26] see the um how is the site called priced
[44:29] in in Bitcoin 21 I think is the site
[44:31] where you can see the average us and UK
[44:33] home prices and five years ago it was
[44:36] around 30 Bitcoin and now it's around 56
[44:38] Bitcoin the average home price uh and
[44:41] it's already like from 30 to five it's
[44:43] it's like a massive crash already in
[44:45] five years um now my question a little
[44:48] bit speculative but maybe you have a
[44:50] framework to think about it what do you
[44:52] think H how much Sates do does someone
[44:56] now need to accumulate at to buy an an
[44:58] home in like 20 years when we see that
[45:01] Trend continuing like now you need like
[45:03] 500 million Sates uh but it's already
[45:06] crashing down a lot from this 32 Bitcoin
[45:10] what do you think is like an a rough
[45:13] estimate for yours like to buy a home
[45:15] because I'm really interested in
[45:17] measuring Bitcoin not in US dollars but
[45:19] measuring Bitcoin in like oh how much
[45:22] kilograms of gold can I buy how much
[45:24] land can I buy how much real estate can
[45:26] I buy I think makes way more sense to
[45:28] measure a Bitcoin against something real
[45:30] and not something a feared yeah I I I
[45:35] think if we're going to assume that um
[45:36] an average European home price is going
[45:39] to be a million euros I'm not sure what
[45:41] it is now but I presume it's
[45:43] substantially lower than that I would
[45:44] have thought across the board um you
[45:46] know EUR European Union is a big place
[45:49] but if I can speculate that it's Circa
[45:51] 500,000 now and I presume it's probably
[45:54] a lot lower if you consider that you've
[45:56] got Portugal and
[45:57] Spain you've got Greece and Italy as
[46:00] well in that um you know German Germany
[46:02] and Austria and France are probably the
[46:04] most well healed in that crew so I think
[46:07] 500,000 would be very generous across
[46:09] the board in the EU I think in the next
[46:12] 20 years um an average European home
[46:14] price is going to be you know roughly a
[46:17] million a million euro and I think
[46:19] you're going to be able to get that
[46:21] for
[46:24] 001 of the Bitcoin so I think it's going
[46:27] to be roughly a million Satoshi I I like
[46:29] that number million Satoshi because it's
[46:32] uh uh it's it's also with becoming a
[46:35] millionaire this is something so so big
[46:37] in the in in people's head and becoming
[46:39] a sotion millionaire I think it it will
[46:42] get get to a bigger State again and I
[46:44] think becoming a millionaire becomes
[46:46] less and less interesting because a
[46:48] million gets diluted more and more it
[46:50] was way way more interesting like 20
[46:53] years ago now you you have to be a Deca
[46:55] millionaire and stuff like that so I
[46:57] think a millions of does is really uh a
[47:00] good amount um now one more question
[47:03] before we come to the end routine do you
[47:05] see any challenges or hurdles uh coming
[47:09] along the way for for Bitcoin adoption
[47:12] yeah I do I think it's just a completely
[47:14] misunderstood asset I think volatility
[47:16] is going to continue to scare people and
[47:19] I don't think there's a solution to that
[47:21] volatility problem and a lot of people
[47:24] get scared about bitcoin's volatility
[47:26] and they think it's a bug but they don't
[47:28] understand the volatility is the feature
[47:30] that's the ability for Bitcoin to be
[47:31] worth 100 million or a billion on that a
[47:34] revision of that you know how much is a
[47:36] home going to cost I wouldn't be
[47:37] surprised if it's 100,000 Satoshi in 20
[47:40] years time and that seems completely
[47:42] insane but relative to where everyone is
[47:45] right now and you the need that is going
[47:47] to come for Bitcoin I I don't think
[47:50] that's outrageous to think whatsoever
[47:52] but there is going to be some people who
[47:54] are going to go out on the risk curve
[47:56] who need Bitcoin who have to take the
[47:58] risk because they don't have any other
[48:00] options and this is where you know if I
[48:02] look at the demographics for investing
[48:04] in real estate V
[48:07] Bitcoin real estate's over you've got
[48:10] the generation which holds all the
[48:12] wealth owning 80 90% of the real estate
[48:15] now the generations who are going to
[48:16] inherit that wealth the Millennials genz
[48:19] what have you they're not interested in
[48:20] owning huge homes and tying up a huge
[48:23] amount of capital to that that's not
[48:25] what they're about they're about
[48:26] experiences about having flexibility
[48:28] optionality and having all of your
[48:30] assets tied up in a huge
[48:32] home you know making huge
[48:34] generalizations here isn't as appealing
[48:36] as having you know 10 20 30 50 Bitcoin
[48:40] at your disposal and being able to rent
[48:42] that lifestyle for pennies on the dollar
[48:44] and I'll give you an example here if you
[48:46] want to in
[48:47] Australia if you want to hold or
[48:49] purchase a really nice home it's going
[48:52] to cost you Circa $10 million in the
[48:54] part of the world that I am and you're
[48:57] going to have a stamp duty to purchase
[48:59] that property which is a government tax
[49:01] that they levy on you just to purchase
[49:02] it they're going to charge you close to
[49:04] $700 to $800,000 just to purchase it in
[49:07] a oneoff fee so it's going to cost you
[49:11] call it $11 million to purchase that
[49:13] property um you can Finance maybe 50% of
[49:17] it so you're going to have a $5 million
[49:19] loan on it that $5 million loan is going
[49:21] to be at a rate of 6 or 7% that 7% on
[49:25] 500,000 is going to cost you 300
[49:27] $50,000 a year um and you can't claim
[49:32] that as a tax
[49:33] deduction and that's how much it's going
[49:35] to cost you to own it it's going to cost
[49:37] you5 million or $6 million in equity
[49:39] plus a $5 million mortgage that's going
[49:41] to cost you
[49:41] $350,000 a year
[49:44] alternatively you can just rent that
[49:47] lifestyle and you can pay one to 2% of
[49:49] the value of that property and you can
[49:52] rent that so I look at the Gen Z you
[49:55] know and I look at and think why would
[49:57] they pay you know $5 million plus
[50:00] $350,000 a year just to own that
[50:02] property when they can rent that
[50:04] lifestyle for $200,000 a year and they
[50:07] can save the 5 million put that into
[50:08] Bitcoin and they can have a return of
[50:10] 50% on that peran so they're making $25
[50:14] million a year investing it in Bitcoin
[50:18] and it's saving them $150,000 in running
[50:20] cost per anom on the property yet they
[50:23] get the same result I just look at this
[50:25] and I think that the the Baby Boomers
[50:27] don't understand what's coming down the
[50:29] road there's no one coming to buy their
[50:30] big Properties or not the the level
[50:33] that's needed to maintain those values
[50:35] so what needs to happen you either need
[50:38] to get really loose credit policies with
[50:40] really low interest rates to maintain
[50:41] those property values or alternatively
[50:44] you just move to an investment where the
[50:47] demographics and the population are in
[50:48] your favor and I you know by my
[50:50] calculations there may be a million
[50:52] people on that little Bitcoin Island
[50:55] right now and there's going to be eight
[50:57] billion people there in the next 20
[50:59] years so where do you want your money
[51:01] where the people are going to be that's
[51:03] crazy so you're saying there's a a 7%
[51:06] buying tax on property yes yes there is
[51:10] so an example I did for a client just
[51:12] the other day on a $7.5 million property
[51:15] was going to cost them
[51:17] $450,000 in stamp Duty that's crazy for
[51:21] me plus plus if it's an investment
[51:23] property they're going to charge a 1%
[51:25] plus uh land tax on that property per
[51:29] anom so I mean there are just multiple
[51:32] reasons why you don't really want to be
[51:33] in that investment relative to
[51:36] bitcoin yeah it's like if you have to
[51:38] pay a tax per year to the government you
[51:41] don't own that property you don't yeah
[51:45] abely don't do that that's I think we we
[51:48] covered a lot of points uh about real
[51:50] estate versus Bitcoin and why it's a
[51:52] good idea to stick with Bitcoin and not
[51:55] do real estate one small personal uh
[51:58] story from me I was actually going to
[52:00] buy my first property before I bought
[52:03] Bitcoin and then I discovered Bitcoin
[52:05] and never B purchased the first property
[52:07] and I'm so glad I discovered Bitcoin I'm
[52:10] just so glad I went into the Bitcoin uh
[52:13] and not in the real estate area uh but
[52:16] yeah that's a that's a small nugget for
[52:18] me and I'm just so so happy that I to
[52:22] that time found Michael S and all the
[52:24] other ones that that orange buillt me
[52:26] through the so many podcasts that were
[52:29] out there and one of uh my my motivation
[52:31] also to to put a podcast out a day
[52:34] because that there will be some people
[52:36] out there that uh have an lifechanging
[52:39] experience through my podcast and that's
[52:40] that's that's all uh that that needs to
[52:44] happen and then it's really cool thank
[52:46] you um we have a new endro tetine uh
[52:48] that came uh between last time you were
[52:51] on until now um where I asked one
[52:55] question uh that is challenging the the
[52:58] the guest to think of something they can
[53:00] teach the audience that has not been uh
[53:03] talked about on the podcast already so
[53:05] the question is what can we learn from
[53:06] you besides all the things that we
[53:08] already uh talked about oh that's a very
[53:12] good question and I've got to pull you
[53:14] up on the question that you asked me
[53:16] last time was an absolute shocker I
[53:18] don't know if you remember that or
[53:20] not I I I even I even uh um I mentioned
[53:25] it on the podcast
[53:26] after the shooting of of trump uh that
[53:30] you brought up the question you got that
[53:33] question you brought up your answer that
[53:34] if he's alive uh and I brought it
[53:37] actually in in in the podcast I did
[53:39] after the assassination at have so like
[53:40] if you want to watch it you you mention
[53:42] in there oh cu the question was and I
[53:45] thought it was just such a nasty
[53:47] question who's going to win the election
[53:49] and why I was like I don't have a dog in
[53:51] that fight but um boy oh boy that was
[53:54] quite a pressing answer um
[53:57] yeah that was a lot of fun I love that
[53:59] so what can I teach or what can I share
[54:02] with everyone that they may not know
[54:04] right now here's something that I think
[54:06] a lot about
[54:08] which is a very well it's a relatively
[54:11] simple problem to solve but it's
[54:14] probably going to give you or the Next
[54:17] Generation that you leave your Bitcoin
[54:18] to the most bang for buck in that
[54:23] getting your estate plan sorted out and
[54:25] ensuring that you you can minimize or
[54:28] mitigate any estate taxes is probably
[54:32] the most effective thing that you can do
[54:35] for generational wealth and I'll just
[54:39] put this into context that across most
[54:41] of Europe and it's going to get worse so
[54:43] these taxes are only going to go up but
[54:45] across Europe across the UK across the
[54:49] US and Northern America you typically
[54:51] have an estate tax death duties whatever
[54:55] you want to call it a
[54:57] 40% now if you're smart you can seek
[55:00] help in mitigating and avoiding that
[55:04] 40% death Duty tax whatever you want to
[55:07] call it and it
[55:11] is it is such a big difference for how
[55:14] much Bitcoin you leave your estate cuz
[55:17] you're not saving them 40% in taxes what
[55:20] you're giving them is an extra 2/3 an
[55:23] extra 66% more Bitcoin then you would
[55:26] otherwise leave them so I look at it
[55:29] that way that you know the number one
[55:31] bank for buck that anyone who's got
[55:33] death duties at the country that they
[55:34] live in the number one thing a bit as a
[55:36] bitcoiner that they should be taking
[55:38] care of is an estate plan that is going
[55:40] to help you avoid and mitigate any of
[55:42] those death duties because if you can do
[55:45] that and you've got a 40% tax rate on on
[55:49] death you're going to leave 66% more
[55:51] Bitcoin to your loved ones that's a big
[55:55] deal that's a huge deal uh taxes is a
[55:59] topic that I'm right now going down the
[56:01] road because till February I didn't have
[56:05] to pay taxes in terms of my employee
[56:09] paid the taxes uh and when the employee
[56:12] pays them you don't seem that much and
[56:14] then you don't care that much which is
[56:15] an amazing concept for the government
[56:17] but all of a sudden you become you step
[56:20] from being employed to being
[56:22] self-employed and starting like a
[56:24] self-employed company you have toay
[56:26] every taxes yourself and you're like oh
[56:28] I don't know I don't know PID my
[56:30] government this much uh and then all of
[56:32] the sudden you're like oh okay this I
[56:34] can do this I can do this I can do so I
[56:36] I I right now go to down the rabbit hole
[56:38] of what I can do and it's amazing for me
[56:41] what what what the possibilities are
[56:42] even in in Austria what you can do
[56:44] legally in Austria but yeah it's I will
[56:47] maybe uh in half a year or one year if
[56:50] I'm more educated on that make a a long
[56:52] video on that what my experiences with
[56:55] that was because I think a lot of um the
[56:59] I I saw yesterday a video somewhere and
[57:01] he's like like the the the best saving
[57:04] you can do is on taxes everything else
[57:06] spend it and enjoy your life but on on
[57:08] taxes that's the the biggest saving you
[57:10] can do for yourself and otherwise other
[57:12] than that focus on getting your income
[57:15] up yeah really it it's funny I've spent
[57:18] the last couple of weeks in America and
[57:21] I went to the Nashville con conference
[57:23] thought it was great but um while in
[57:26] America I got to spend time with some of
[57:28] America's best asset protection and tax
[57:30] lawyers in the country and what I
[57:33] learned was so incredibly mind-blowing I
[57:36] can't tell you I'm just looking at this
[57:38] thinking the the ability to um reduce
[57:42] your taxable income um create favorable
[57:45] tax outcomes and help um avoid some of
[57:49] those estate taxes was just mind-blowing
[57:51] to me and this is where for me I look at
[57:54] this and think um this is where a lot of
[57:57] the opportunity comes for the Bitcoin is
[57:58] that they don't really comprehend or
[58:01] understand what this tax system is going
[58:02] to do to them and the provisions and
[58:04] protections that are afforded to them if
[58:06] they want to play inside the system and
[58:09] this is where I spend a lot of my time
[58:11] I'm I I play inside the system because
[58:13] I'm licensed by it and the rest of it
[58:15] and can show you a whole host of
[58:16] benefits to doing that but at the same
[58:18] time I respect everyone's uh ability to
[58:20] do non kyc non AML remain completely
[58:23] Anon and 100% privacy Focus so um if you
[58:28] want to play in the kyc space and you
[58:30] know take advantage of those sorts of
[58:32] things then uh I'm your meant but um I
[58:36] respect everyone's right to do whatever
[58:37] they want to and um one of my personal
[58:39] aages is you do you so um but take care
[58:43] of your Bitcoin it's going to go up a
[58:44] lot and if there's any help that we can
[58:46] give in doing that please please reach

[59:48] there's so many great bitcoiners already
[59:50] and I have to check maybe maybe let's do
[59:52] like a whole rundown so I have every
[59:54] advisor once on the podcast
[59:56] um but we still have also the the end
[59:58] routine from the uh that I do since the
[60:02] first podcast where the previous guest
[60:03] is asking a question for the next guest
[60:05] without knowing who the next guest is
[60:06] it's also an interesting one uh not as
[60:08] tricky as the last one I hope have you
[60:12] ever had a supernatural experience maybe
[60:17] Trump ah yeah you know what the closest
[60:21] there are sort of two near-death
[60:22] experiences that I've had in life um one
[60:25] was being
[60:27] less than a meter or two from a 14 13 to
[60:31] 14t great white shark and I was maybe a
[60:35] kilometer or two off the coast and I I
[60:39] may have done a deal with God that I'll
[60:41] be a better person if you let me off the
[60:43] hook here I thought I was going to die
[60:45] and then there was another experience
[60:47] that I had in Whistler British Columbia
[60:49] on a sco resort I basically went into an
[60:51] area that was roped off and got caught
[60:54] in an avalanche and
[60:56] I thought I was dead so as a kid I
[61:00] literally thought I was dead and uh
[61:02] pinched myself realized that I wasn't
[61:04] dug myself out of a basically
[61:07] a having been covered up to my face and
[61:10] uh basically went in for the day it was
[61:13] the first run and it was the last run of
[61:14] the day so I basically went in and
[61:18] feeling like I'd cheated death so there
[61:20] are two moments in my life where I feel
[61:21] like I've cheated death and maybe had an
[61:23] out of body Out of Body Experience so
[61:25] that'll be the closest to it thank you
[61:28] so much Peter for for sharing this with
[61:29] us also thank you so much for uh being
