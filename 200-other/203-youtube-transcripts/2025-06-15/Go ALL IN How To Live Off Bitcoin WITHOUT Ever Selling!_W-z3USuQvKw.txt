[00:00] once you get Bitcoin in self custody You
[00:02] Are by default a cliona is it then
[00:05] possible to never having to sell your
[00:08] Bitcoin when you know that it's the
[00:09] scarcest asset of the universe one may
[00:12] not want to give up on this corn one
[00:15] solution for that is you can borrow cash
[00:17] against your Bitcoin and then you can
[00:19] spend you can spend and get the goods
[00:21] you need you've huddled enough start
[00:23] living man if you have a cash flow if
[00:25] you work you can basically pay back for
[00:27] your loan and keep the Bitcoin because
[00:30] this will grow in value over time it's
[00:32] the same thing that people do with their
[00:34] stocks the same thing that people do
[00:35] with their houses another perk for doing
[00:38] such a thing is that you avoid paying
[00:40] taxes if you if you sell an asset you
[00:43] will have capital gain taxes on that but
[00:45] if you borrow against this asset you can
[00:48] spend the money and as long as you repay
[00:50] your loan and you're not being
[00:52] liquidated you don't have a capital gain
[00:54] tax Bitcoin allows you to have access to
[00:57] the same strategy the really wealthy
[00:59] people in traditional Finance have
[01:01] access
[01:02] [Music]
[01:06] to hi science how you doing everything
[01:08] fine on your end yes I'm doing good
[01:10] thank you Robin for inviting me on your
[01:12] podcast really cool by the way uh
[01:14] science is an interesting how how did
[01:16] you come to to call yourself science uh
[01:20] gal genial or like how do you say it uh
[01:23] we than shy story I mean I think uh it
[01:26] was back in the days when I was still
[01:28] into crypto
[01:30] and I wanted to you know draw a small um
[01:33] small character like a scientist
[01:35] explaining stuff and it never happened I
[01:38] never did it but I kept the the name and
[01:41] the the gel the gel is because I don't
[01:44] know if you're familiar with dragon ball
[01:48] and uh in Dragon Ball you have um the
[01:50] master of s Goku the main character is
[01:54] called uh Master roshi but in French
[01:57] because I'm French uh we call him uh um
[02:01] tort genal G so yeah I don't know why I
[02:04] just decided it's GNA be my name oh
[02:06] that's that's that's really cool so so
[02:08] you're also um trying to um keep your
[02:12] private distance and kind of uh be as
[02:15] private as possible in in in the
[02:17] internet
[02:18] sphere yeah I mean I tried but um it's
[02:22] been one year uh that I show myself in
[02:25] podcasts and you can see me on in Live
[02:28] Events like Bitcoin conference and stuff
[02:30] so I would say that that I'm just
[02:33] limiting uh the informations that um can
[02:36] be collected on the internet without um
[02:39] D directly knowing me but uh it's it's
[02:42] not Anon um I'm not Anonymous right it's
[02:45] just
[02:47] ponos yeah it's it's an interesting
[02:49] thing once you get a little bit out it's
[02:51] almost like you're out completely
[02:52] because like people see your face people
[02:54] see things from you and can tie to some
[02:57] things so uh it's a it's it's almost
[03:01] like you you you once you get out out a
[03:03] little bit you're almost incentivized to
[03:05] go out all in and and have the benefits
[03:08] from having your name out there uh but
[03:10] yeah it's uh I see some people that do
[03:13] the the the middle path of try to be out
[03:16] there uh be a person that is like you
[03:19] can see but still try to communicate as
[03:22] little as possible from like the
[03:24] personal side it really depends on
[03:27] what's your um what's your background on
[03:28] the internet right uh if you have a past
[03:31] on the internet basically if you had a l
[03:34] LinkedIn profile LinkedIn profile you
[03:36] know and you have tons on pictures uh
[03:39] tons of pictures of you on the
[03:41] internet and all that stuff it's really
[03:44] difficult but I don't think maybe maybe
[03:48] your followers will prove wrong right I
[03:50] don't know but uh I don't think I have
[03:52] that much pictures and informations
[03:55] about me so yeah I'm in I'm in between
[03:58] because I show my partially my face I
[04:01] don't tell my name I'm not really
[04:03] bothered if someone finds out who I am
[04:06] but I don't have that much um um yeah
[04:10] traces on of about me on the internet so
[04:14] yeah that's that's a whole topic
[04:15] interesting yeah I wanted to get into
[04:17] something different but uh maybe that's
[04:20] interesting also to get down that road a
[04:22] little bit do you feel or do you foresee
[04:25] that there will be some sort of attacks
[04:27] against bitcoiners I mean there has been
[04:30] already so there it's like there's a
[04:32] public log around that but do you feel
[04:34] like there's bigger attacks coming
[04:36] against bitcoiners down the road well
[04:38] that's an interesting question but uh
[04:40] you you need to explain what
[04:42] you what uh what do you understand when
[04:45] you say attack I mean which kind of
[04:47] attack are we talking about like you
[04:50] know you have to Define who is the
[04:52] attacker uh is it the state is it
[04:56] someone who wants to rob you uh um yeah
[05:00] basically when when we talk about attack
[05:02] there is different threat models so I
[05:05] would say I'm I'm less I'm less um
[05:08] worried about people wanting to rob me
[05:11] or I don't have a lot of money I don't
[05:14] care or yeah I'm talking about
[05:16] bitcoiners in general I'm not I'm less
[05:20] I'm less worried about yeah robbers and
[05:23] direct attacks and I'm a little bit more
[05:26] worried about um State uh state level
[05:30] attacks um especially in Europe feels
[05:34] like uh in America right now freedom is
[05:37] uh is the motel but in Europe it's more
[05:40] like when you are
[05:42] bitcoiner sooner or later you're going
[05:44] to be pointed out as the
[05:48] one um at you like basically soon
[05:53] bitcoiners will be the root cause of
[05:56] poverty and and misery in uh in European
[05:59] Union right feels like that yeah it's
[06:02] it's it's weird but it's I do have a lot
[06:04] of Hope because usually Europe uh is
[06:07] just lagging behind America uh and
[06:11] America kind of gives uh the the path
[06:13] forward a a little bit so I I do have a
[06:16] lot of Hope for that um but once we like
[06:20] maybe let's look at that like do you are
[06:23] you just worried because of the EU or
[06:26] are you also worried when the government
[06:28] is trying to incorporate Bitcoin Embrace
[06:32] Bitcoin H and then kind of have attacks
[06:35] on that side uh because they uh it's
[06:38] like a a lower level of attack where you
[06:41] don't see it it's not obvious like EU is
[06:43] obviously against Bitcoin uh but if
[06:46] someone is full Bitcoin they can
[06:48] probably attack it easily because you
[06:50] don't really recognize the attack that
[06:52] much I don't really have opinions on
[06:55] that like if you talk about you know
[06:58] Global the Global movement right now
[07:00] with strategic Reserve maybe it's it's
[07:03] what you're trying to to put on the
[07:06] table but I'm not really worried about
[07:08] that I don't think Bitcoin fits uh
[07:11] government needs and I don't think self-
[07:15] custody is adapted to such large
[07:18] organizations I
[07:20] mean how would how would the government
[07:24] um take custody of uh
[07:27] Bitcoin I I don't know I I don't know
[07:29] that's a topic I I wouldn't um go I
[07:33] wouldn't go deep into but
[07:36] um uh no I'm more I'm more into the
[07:39] threat like you know from one Satoshi
[07:42] you got [ __ ] your money
[07:45] and it's funny because once you get
[07:48] Bitcoin in self- custody You Are by
[07:52] default a canona I don't know if you're
[07:54] familiar with the consilion
[07:57] effect yeah of course yeah yeah so yeah
[08:01] I'm I'm more worried about it because um
[08:05] Central Bank governments in collusion
[08:08] with uh can
[08:10] millionaires uh they I don't think they
[08:13] will like concurrence and having people
[08:15] being a canona by default just because
[08:18] they have the the most scarce asset of
[08:21] the world kind of empowers everyone uh
[08:24] like even if you have a small amount of
[08:26] money all of the sudden everyone is on
[08:28] on the same power level and this is kind
[08:30] of frightening them will be really
[08:33] interesting uh but you're doing a lot in
[08:35] the space uh I I heard like lerat you're
[08:38] involved you're doing with dlc's a lot
[08:41] like it's it's almost like so much that
[08:43] it's hard to keep track like what are
[08:45] you what are the main things that you're
[08:46] currently doing um if you talk about
[08:48] lerat lendat is um okay lat is a is a
[08:53] project right now it's in beta and the
[08:56] end goal is to have uh peerto Bitcoin
[09:00] collateral collateralized loans I don't
[09:02] know if you're familiar with that but
[09:05] basically it's the same thing uh in the
[09:08] US when you need to to get a loan you
[09:11] will um you will have a mortgage and
[09:13] basically you will put your house on the
[09:16] table and say okay this is the guarantee
[09:18] and if I don't pay back the bank can
[09:21] save my house and sell it to cover the
[09:25] loss uh Bitcoin collateralized loans it
[09:28] works exactly the same and so
[09:31] far um you it ex it already exists right
[09:35] Bitcoin collateralized loans uh are
[09:37] something that we know for years but
[09:40] when you need to get a loan against your
[09:43] Bitcoin for now you you have to trust a
[09:46] bank or an institution or a company with
[09:49] your coins it means that you need to
[09:52] send them the you
[09:54] utxo and you will have your loan and if
[09:58] they don't frag you or don't disappear
[10:01] you will get your Bitcoin back after
[10:03] paying back your loan lat is trying to
[10:06] fix this um and yeah there is a sentence
[10:10] for that um at lat we say we're trying
[10:13] to do to credit what Bitcoin did to
[10:18] money basically we're trying to to build
[10:20] a P2P Market um self custodial of
[10:24] Bitcoin collateralized loads that means
[10:26] that yeah peers can lend to bitcoin
[10:31] holders and Bitcoin holders can keep the
[10:35] custody at least the control of the
[10:37] funds um during the whole process using
[10:41] DLCs I don't know if you want to go that
[10:43] far now
[10:45] but I I do want but maybe a little bit
[10:48] later because I think uh uh the first
[10:51] thing we we kind of have to cover is we
[10:54] we always hear of of not always it gets
[10:58] less now but we we have block fan
[11:00] Celsius and like 30 other smaller ones
[11:03] that uh all did the kind of the same
[11:05] thing that got borrowing against your
[11:08] Bitcoin a Bad Name a bad image uh and
[11:11] that's why I think it has to be as as
[11:13] you said s custodial and trying to make
[11:16] that good again M make a Bitcoin
[11:19] borrowing safe again I don't know if you
[11:22] that could be nice slow well that's
[11:25] that's what I said earlier uh we aim you
[11:28] know that's a marketing Center but still
[11:30] it's true we aim to do to credit what
[11:32] Bitcoin did to
[11:34] money what does that mean that means
[11:36] that it if we want it to be safe we need
[11:42] um by the
[11:44] code enforce the fact that it's
[11:47] peer-to-peer you cannot have a middleman
[11:50] here ragging or abusing um his position
[11:54] to collude or to steal the funds of the
[11:57] others um another another thing that is
[12:00] important is if it's peer-to-peer and
[12:03] you you prevent hypothecation you cannot
[12:07] have paper Bitcoin right um one of the
[12:12] one of the biggest problem if you look
[12:15] at the FTX um
[12:18] catastroph uh from um I don't know last
[12:21] year or two years ago I don't remember
[12:24] but
[12:25] um the the worst thing about trusting
[12:28] people with the funds is that they can
[12:31] re hypothecate re hypothecate it and
[12:34] basically create fractional reserves and
[12:38] paper Bitcoin that cannot happen in a
[12:40] peer-to-peer
[12:42] Market with um yeah with the code
[12:45] enforcing the relationship and without
[12:48] any trusted third
[12:50] party uh that's a good point um is it
[12:53] then also from uh possible to this
[12:56] concept of never having to sell your
[12:59] coin you always hdle the same like the
[13:01] salor strategy that that we want to have
[13:04] that's um that's a Hot Topic I I mean
[13:08] yeah people can discuss that because
[13:11] obviously you had you had a trend saying
[13:14] like hodle you need to huddle and never
[13:17] sell but then it has been replaced by
[13:20] spendal yeah if you want to if you want
[13:23] Bitcoin to benefit from the network
[13:24] effect you need to spend you need to let
[13:27] the set flow and
[13:29] basically it it has to
[13:32] circulate I agree with both and I think
[13:36] people should spend their Bitcoin in
[13:39] Bitcoin native
[13:40] businesses there's not a lot of Bitcoin
[13:44] there's not so many Bitcoin businesses
[13:46] right now but you still got to live and
[13:50] how how would you live um if you need to
[13:53] pay your rent if you need to pay I don't
[13:55] know a car
[13:57] taxes um you may need to sell Bitcoin
[14:01] and that's really unfortunate when you
[14:03] when you know that it's the scarcest
[14:05] asset of the
[14:07] universe one may not want to um give up
[14:11] on this corn right so one solution for
[14:15] that is you can borrow cash uh against
[14:19] your Bitcoin and then you can spend you
[14:21] can spend and get the goods you need
[14:23] basically you've huddled enough you
[14:27] leave now start leaving man and pay
[14:29] later that's the motto and uh if you
[14:33] have a cash flow if you work you can
[14:35] basically pay back for your loan and
[14:37] keep the Bitcoin because you you know
[14:40] perfectly that this will grow in value
[14:43] over time I don't know if it was clear
[14:46] yeah I think it's uh it's it's it's it's
[14:49] a strategy of uh not having to to to
[14:52] sell uh your Bitcoin and maybe like uh
[14:56] refund like it's the same thing that uh
[14:59] people do with their stocks the same
[15:01] thing that people do with their houses
[15:03] and all the things that's a great Point
[15:06] uh I think Americans have an expression
[15:09] for that b die and basically the riches
[15:14] um in the US I think we had a topic on
[15:18] that on X um with with with musk
[15:21] borrowing against this Tesla stock or
[15:24] whatever but basically in America um the
[15:27] riches they will um they will borrow
[15:30] against their assets for a living and
[15:34] they will not sell because this is where
[15:37] um all their wealth is stocked right uh
[15:41] another perk for doing such a thing is
[15:44] that you avoid paying taxes doing so if
[15:47] you sell an asset unfortunately in
[15:50] Europe in America in a lot of place in
[15:52] many places around the globe if you if
[15:55] you sell an asset uh you will have
[15:59] capital gain taxes on that especially
[16:02] obviously if these assets grow grw up in
[16:05] value um but if you borrow against this
[16:07] asset you can spend the money and as
[16:10] long as you as long as you are you as
[16:14] you repay your loan and you you're not
[16:17] being liquidated you don't have a
[16:18] capital gain tax on this operation so
[16:22] that strategy is really known in
[16:24] traditional finance and it's called buy
[16:26] borrow die basically
[16:29] once again Bitcoin allows you to to have
[16:33] access to the to the same strategy the
[16:36] really wealthy um people in traditional
[16:39] Finance have access to interesting what
[16:41] what is the uh interest rates that uh
[16:46] for for for your uh liking makes sense
[16:49] and doesn't make sense like where is the
[16:51] the drop off point where like it's it's
[16:53] too high uh no matter what and uh maybe
[16:57] under that it's it's more
[16:59] in in the in this feere because it seems
[17:01] like Landing out especially with Bitcoin
[17:04] you need maybe like a higher one I think
[17:06] there is a I don't think there is
[17:10] um I don't know I don't know what to
[17:12] answer to that because the the the real
[17:14] answer is the market decides right I I
[17:19] will I will give you a few examples you
[17:20] have
[17:21] centralized Banks and companies offering
[17:25] pretty pretty good uh pretty good rates
[17:28] um
[17:29] but you have big tradeoffs such as the
[17:32] fact that you lose custody
[17:34] okay you have the defi ecosystem that's
[17:37] the Other Extreme right with very very
[17:41] high uh rates with the benefits of being
[17:44] no
[17:45] kyc and um um
[17:49] supposedly uh safe it is not right you
[17:54] have in between different other type of
[17:57] solutions such as escrow based Solutions
[18:00] we can talk about I don't know maybe
[18:02] Unchained fire fish so basically you
[18:05] have an escrow in the middle and he will
[18:08] um he will help the situation to settle
[18:12] in the case of a dispute between a
[18:14] borrower and A lender and then you have
[18:16] other types of rates here but if we talk
[18:19] about the future the future uh I mean
[18:22] self custodial asess Bitcoin
[18:25] collateralized loans we don't have um a
[18:29] clear idea of what the rates are going
[18:31] to be because it's going to be self
[18:33] custodial with far less
[18:36] risks with no risks of dispute on the
[18:39] side of the lender so maybe the lender
[18:41] will ask far lower uh interest rates
[18:44] because it's previsible for them you can
[18:48] guess
[18:49] that
[18:51] um yeah I don't know if you if you if
[18:54] you listen to someone like safy and
[18:56] moose he says that in the future in the
[18:59] far future um the loans um will get to
[19:05] 0% rate when we will get on on the
[19:08] Bitcoin standard but for now one thing
[19:10] is sure you have a lot of different
[19:13] interest rates depending on the model of
[19:15] the platform depending of the on the
[19:19] conditions of the loans and I have no
[19:22] idea what what would what should be a
[19:24] fair rate and I think the right answer
[19:28] is is to let let the market decide I
[19:31] don't know if I if it's a satisfying
[19:33] answer uh what what what did CER didn't
[19:37] mean with 0% interest rate is like with
[19:40] Bitcoin um I can only advise you to have
[19:44] a look to one of his uh videos I think
[19:46] he did a
[19:48] conference um I don't remember the name
[19:51] of the conference but the conference was
[19:53] about uh the Usery the end of Usery with
[19:56] Bitcoin and that on the Bitcoin standard
[19:59] on a long time long um if you have a
[20:02] long enough um Horizon of time interest
[20:06] rate will be will tend to be zero on the
[20:08] bit standard but I I don't remember the
[20:11] the exact name of the podcast you can
[20:13] find it and I think it's the one safy
[20:16] used to promote his new book the gold
[20:19] standard which is a
[20:22] fiction yeah 0% for me makes no sense
[20:27] like why why would someone do that like
[20:30] why why would someone give money for for
[20:32] nothing in return I don't know but uh I
[20:36] guess what's more important in that um
[20:39] in that um presentation is that the
[20:42] interest rate will
[20:44] tend um to 0% and maybe not absolutely
[20:49] 0% right but uh it means I trust Society
[20:54] it means High transparency Society it
[20:57] means that people um on the Bitcoin
[20:59] standard are um are building and are and
[21:03] are producing value and yeah so
[21:05] basically that's a whole new
[21:09] paradigm I can't tell if if save din is
[21:11] right I don't know but uh it's very
[21:13] interesting to listen to him yeah it's a
[21:17] super interesting topic also because you
[21:19] have on the one side uh if it's all in a
[21:22] in a contract escro DLC whatever the
[21:25] technology is and you know like uh on
[21:28] the lender side you almost can't lose
[21:31] the the funds like you you you you
[21:33] cannot lose lose money you can always
[21:35] kind of get it back then uh it's it's
[21:39] has very low risks but at the same time
[21:42] you know that the other side makes like
[21:44] almost a risk-free 30%
[21:47] 40% return rate with with Bitcoin so
[21:49] like it it will be really fun to see
[21:51] where the the free market prices will
[21:53] end up with interest rates that's
[21:56] uh that's really interesting and I don't
[21:59] have the answer myself because there
[22:00] there's as there is as much answers um I
[22:05] mean everyone got different needs at the
[22:08] end of the day the market decide look uh
[22:11] you could you could tell yourself um yo
[22:14] these these people lending me USD they
[22:17] definitely deserve to be paid a high
[22:19] rate because they take the risk of
[22:22] being exposed to the USD right uh you
[22:26] you could you could tell that they are
[22:28] the one on taking the risk right so they
[22:31] deserve to be paid in the other end um
[22:34] because you don't want to sell your
[22:36] Bitcoin you want to keep it uh you you
[22:39] can definitely um pay for your living
[22:43] using Bitcoin loans but um of course you
[22:47] you you could also tell um yeah this is
[22:49] the most scarce asset of them all the
[22:52] race should be really low both sensors
[22:54] are right I don't know who is right the
[22:56] market decide Market decides that's the
[22:59] charge of our life I guess um is is
[23:02] lerat already online is that
[23:06] available lendat is currently uh running
[23:10] it's um we call it beta
[23:13] reloaded that's the second phase of the
[23:15] closed beta during this closed beta
[23:18] we're shaping The Experience so
[23:21] basically we are opening the borrower
[23:24] side and the lender side of the other
[23:26] book we are acting as um yeah as a black
[23:30] board um that means that trying the
[23:33] lenders at beta you can you can um you
[23:37] can make Loan offers and borrowers can
[23:40] have a look to these Loan offers and
[23:43] they can yeah request one of them and
[23:45] then the peer-to-peer interaction
[23:48] happens um as long as we're in close
[23:50] beta we are not running the full
[23:52] protocol yet we're shaping the ux and
[23:56] we're really glad that the the users now
[23:59] give feedback give suggestions and tell
[24:02] us what's what's good and what's wrong
[24:04] so we can make the perfect ux before
[24:06] getting public and as long as we are in
[24:10] the beta we are still working um on an
[24:13] escrow model uh like it means basically
[24:17] you have a a two out of three multisig
[24:21] escrow and in the case of a dispute we
[24:24] would be here um yeah basically to to
[24:27] make sure the Mone goes in the right
[24:29] direction but in the future once we we
[24:32] get released we will we will work on um
[24:36] a DLC model and basically it's it's a
[24:40] two out of two
[24:42] multi with uh an Oracle in the middle I
[24:46] I I won't go too much technical don't
[24:47] worry but basically it get it gets rid
[24:51] of us in the middle of our key and I may
[24:55] maybe except if you want me to explain a
[24:58] little bit later what the DLC is but I
[25:00] won't explain right now basically it
[25:02] just it just get rid of um of the man in
[25:06] the middle us you don't have any dispute
[25:10] anymore uh one last thing to tell about
[25:13] this beta is that as a differentiator uh
[25:17] on lerat we are building what we call
[25:19] the lerat store and borers can okay uh
[25:25] for now Loan offers are expressed in
[25:28] stable coins and we all know that
[25:30] bitcoiners may be allergic to stable
[25:32] coins right I I don't like stable coins
[25:35] and Al chains myself this is why we
[25:38] decided to provide opin
[25:41] Solutions and and borrowers can you
[25:44] unilaterally ask for the loan to be
[25:46] disbursed say for example on a virtual
[25:49] card we have a virtual Visa
[25:51] card and borrowers can have this virtual
[25:54] Visa card and pay for things online
[25:57] without having to touch the the stable
[26:00] coins basically the lender will fund the
[26:02] card for him and it works it works
[26:04] really well since the first phase of the
[26:06] beta and we are currently working to add
[26:09] and integrate more spending tools off
[26:12] ramps and also onramps to pay back your
[26:16] loan using credit card or bank transfer
[26:20] so you don't have so the the yeah let's
[26:24] say the stable coin and Alain experience
[26:26] could be erased if you allergic to it as
[26:29] a
[26:31] bitcoiner yeah it's it's basically like
[26:33] if if I want to if I think about
[26:35] borrowing against my Bitcoin and I want
[26:37] to do it uh I want to do it in a way
[26:40] where I maybe have a card and directly
[26:42] can spend it uh with that credit card
[26:45] maybe because if I then get it on my
[26:48] normal bank account I might get question
[26:50] from the banks that I don't want to
[26:52] answer like it's a headache and I show
[26:54] them documentation uh it's it's all
[26:57] legit but try to avoid questionings uh
[27:00] and the other thing is if it's a stable
[27:02] coin then then I also have to figure out
[27:06] how to convert it to to to a functioning
[27:09] credit card to so I can spend it and can
[27:12] transact and can pay my rent and
[27:14] whatever I can pay like the I think best
[27:16] would be really like just have like
[27:18] borrow against a Bitcoin and have a
[27:20] credit cards accompan with that where
[27:23] you can just pay wherever you want to
[27:24] pay with that that would be I think the
[27:26] optimal case
[27:28] um I believe so too but um the most
[27:32] what's What's um okay what what I want
[27:36] to do with the lender set store
[27:38] personally is to let the borrowers
[27:40] decide Market rules as always and um we
[27:44] need we want to keep on lerat a layer
[27:47] one of the protocol on which um anyone
[27:51] can come and borrow our land without
[27:53] having to kyc without having whatever so
[27:58] so it's it's always going to be
[28:00] permissionless then borers can at their
[28:04] will opt for Solutions like I talked
[28:06] about U this um virtual card this
[28:10] virtual card does not require any
[28:12] documents um so it's basically no
[28:15] kyc um but in the future we may add I
[28:19] don't know off frames like you you don't
[28:21] want this you don't want to have a
[28:22] virtual card you want to have cash in
[28:24] the bank we we could add different
[28:26] solutions of FRS I don't know bu Bitcoin
[28:30] or Mont pin or relay uh I I don't have
[28:35] any deals with them I just giving
[28:37] examples right now but the why why am I
[28:40] saying this is because we don't want to
[28:43] force the relationship with the
[28:45] borrowers and if a
[28:46] borrower likes to use a solution whether
[28:50] it's kyc or not whether it's bank
[28:52] account or not whether it's kyc or not
[28:56] he should be free to do so
[28:58] that's why yeah we believe in letting
[29:01] them choose and having a store of
[29:03] different solutions basically they will
[29:05] select what suits best conditions fees
[29:09] whatever ah free market at its best I
[29:13] think that's it's really cool um maybe
[29:16] let's go now and sorry wa I just um want
[29:20] to add something on this since I
[29:23] remember it's at the end of the day it's
[29:25] just an order book right people lending
[29:27] people borrowing
[29:28] having these plugins basically these
[29:32] spending tools and offramp solution
[29:35] borrowers can opt in unilaterally
[29:38] without fragmenting the order book that
[29:40] means at the end of the day the order
[29:41] book is still Bitcoin and stable coins
[29:44] and it would be a nightmare to match the
[29:46] different spending tools if it was um on
[29:51] the on the lender side no we decided to
[29:54] put it on the borrower side unilaterally
[29:57] so we hopefully we can capture the
[29:59] market and have the deepest liquidity
[30:02] Market as possible I partnered up with
[30:05] coin vigilante this is the most
[30:07] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[30:10] saw created by anyone look at that
[30:13] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[30:16] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[30:19] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[30:22] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[30:25] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[30:28] only and coin vigilante just dropped a
[30:30] completely new and amazing Genesis
[30:33] edition of their watch collections you
[30:36] have the date of the first ever mined
[30:39] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[30:41] also the block height and which EPO we
[30:44] are currently in I love the level of
[30:47] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[30:50] and make sure to check out those amazing
[30:53] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[30:56] descriptions I love those watch
[30:58] so so much if you watch or listen to my
[31:01] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[31:03] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[31:06] the most important step is to keep the
[31:09] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[31:12] wallet my personal recommendation for
[31:14] harder wallet is the bit box it's super
[31:16] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[31:19] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[31:21] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[31:24] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[31:27] at the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[31:31] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[31:34] step is to really level up your
[31:36] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[31:39] have the most secure self- custody setup
[31:42] you have to secure your own devices you
[31:45] have to protect your privacy you have to
[31:47] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[31:50] on where you live you even want to have
[31:53] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[31:55] move in case something goes really
[31:57] really wrong and through all those steps
[31:59] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[32:02] step by step and if you visit the
[32:05] Bitcoin way.com
[32:07] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[32:09] minute free call to find out how you can
[32:12] level up your sovereignty interesting
[32:15] yeah that that's really cool um maybe
[32:18] because we talked about DLC so much and
[32:20] Al escr so maybe let's let's cover what
[32:23] those are um because you currently use
[32:26] it and we also had fire fish and Anin
[32:28] already on and uh they use an an escrow
[32:32] um what is an escrow and then maybe
[32:35] later with the deal yeah basically ANC
[32:37] is um is a a mediator right I don't know
[32:42] if we say that in English um someone
[32:45] that will make sure everything works
[32:46] fine and in the case of a dispute will U
[32:50] decide where the money needs to go how
[32:54] does it work uh on the Bitcoin Network
[32:56] really simple you have uh two out of
[33:00] three
[33:00] multi the escrow generally the platform
[33:04] it can be someone else also it can be a
[33:06] mediator designated by a platform it can
[33:09] be some someone from a user from this
[33:13] platform um he will get he will have a
[33:16] key and the two parties will have a key
[33:19] borrowers got a key lender got a key and
[33:22] the DSC uh the mediator G key and uh in
[33:26] the case of a dispute someone say uh I
[33:29] repaid but the lender um did not sign
[33:32] for me to get my collateral back or the
[33:34] lender say um hey the the borrower never
[33:39] paid me so I won't uh I w't um let him
[33:44] withdraw the collateral then the the
[33:47] escrow um the the the mediator will be
[33:50] able to question these people ask
[33:53] questions basically collect some data
[33:55] maybe some proof and and we decide who
[34:00] to release the money to I don't know if
[34:02] it was clear but basically yeah man in
[34:04] the
[34:05] middle um act as a trusted third party
[34:09] in the case some [ __ ] hits the fan oh
[34:12] yeah camera
[34:14] got well is that better that oh yeah
[34:17] it's was no only very very short no
[34:20] worries um so that that's an this gr so
[34:24] it's basically just a two out of three
[34:25] multi sick yes
[34:28] uh where some sometimes you can have
[34:31] more sophisticated screw as well uh I
[34:35] think fire fish operates a two out of
[34:38] four
[34:39] multi and they basically have a key in
[34:41] the case the [ __ ] hits the fan and they
[34:44] have maybe it's better to ask them
[34:46] directly but I think they have a yeah an
[34:49] oracle with a liquidation Oracle with
[34:51] another key so basically the minimum
[34:55] setup is to have a two out of three and
[34:57] then you can have more sophisticated
[35:00] setups interesting and uh what are now
[35:05] dlc's I will try to to stay as simple as
[35:08] I can but the TLC is the same thing it's
[35:12] it's kind of a scw but uh instead of
[35:15] having a two out of three multic you
[35:17] will have one uh a two um a two out of
[35:21] two multic basically the lender will get
[35:23] a key and the borrower will have a key
[35:27] so when they make the contract um the
[35:30] the money will go into a
[35:32] multisig um which belongs to to both to
[35:36] both
[35:37] parties um the the thing is my camera is
[35:41] gone wait what's happening I don't know
[35:44] what's happening
[35:45] sorry um basically what what will happen
[35:48] at the end of the at the end of the deal
[35:50] one of the party will have to sign in
[35:52] broadcast a transaction for him to
[35:55] withdraw or uh if it's the lender to to
[35:58] liquidate and um since they have one key
[36:03] each the issue needs to be collaborative
[36:07] right and if the [ __ ] hits the fan
[36:09] someone is lying someone is not
[36:11] collaborative let's say you have a
[36:14] fullback solution which is an oracle and
[36:17] Oracle is what is um is a let's say it's
[36:21] a program and the program will sign uh
[36:24] cryptographic signatures every five
[36:27] minutes
[36:28] on this example on BTC USD
[36:31] price right and you need you need to
[36:36] have um you need to have a basically you
[36:39] have you need to have both party
[36:41] collaborating or you can have one party
[36:45] with an adapter signature to complete
[36:48] the signature you will have an
[36:49] information cryptographic information
[36:51] from the from the theoracle so basically
[36:55] DLC works like that collaborative first
[36:58] if collaboration doesn't work the Oracle
[37:01] will help to settle the situation
[37:04] without uh a middleman right it's just
[37:07] cryptography in the
[37:09] program and sometimes people are
[37:12] concerned about oracles first oracles
[37:15] are blind and de to your bet they don't
[37:17] know they don't know you they don't know
[37:19] your bet they won't call you that's not
[37:22] happening second you can have several
[37:25] Oracles in the case of
[37:28] um um Bitcoin collateralized loans you
[37:31] don't have to to be very very
[37:34] um responsive uh you can you can take
[37:38] some computation time and then you can
[37:40] have a quarum of oracles five oracles 10
[37:43] oracles to make sure there is no there
[37:46] is no mistake in the price feed if it's
[37:48] what you're
[37:49] monitoring and lastly last but not least
[37:54] if the Oracle or the Quorum of oracles
[37:57] doesn't move work or doesn't uh respond
[37:59] as expected you have a fallback
[38:01] mechanism and then both parties got
[38:04] refund that's the that's the refund
[38:08] transaction and yeah this is basically
[38:10] DLC if if I wasn't clear feel free to
[38:13] ask me more questions because I don't
[38:15] know I I think I think the interesting
[38:17] part is like what exactly did Oracle uh
[38:21] is like who who it's not a person it's a
[38:24] cryptographic but like what what what
[38:26] that or
[38:28] is okay this Oracle is just um a program
[38:32] running and and signing cryptographic
[38:35] signature signing informations
[38:38] strings and um strings of numbers and
[38:41] letters cryptographic information
[38:42] basically to get the money out of the
[38:45] DLC you will you will have both
[38:47] signatures from lender or borrower and
[38:49] borrower and if you don't have both
[38:52] signatures one of uh one of the parties
[38:56] can broadcast the transaction
[38:58] with the with his signature plus the the
[39:02] information given by the by the Oracle
[39:04] that's what we call adapter signatures
[39:07] but then how does the Oracle decide who
[39:10] who gets the the the cryptographic uh um
[39:15] Sig signing like who gets the
[39:16] cryptographical
[39:18] information so this is let's say um the
[39:21] setup that I explained to you is the
[39:23] basic GLC so if I bet let's say Bitcoin
[39:27] will pump you say Bitcoin will will will
[39:31] dump then this Oracle will be useful
[39:33] right in the case of Bitcoin collateral
[39:36] is at loans the Oracle with the price
[39:38] feed will be useful in the case of a
[39:40] liquidation your collateral does not
[39:43] cover um your your LTV is not is not is
[39:47] too high and the lender needs to
[39:51] liquidate your your collateral in order
[39:53] to cover his um his loan the the Oracle
[39:57] will be useful in that situation in the
[40:00] case of um lendat and since you have two
[40:05] chains um Two Chains involved you will
[40:08] have a DLC on bitcoin uh to keep the
[40:12] collateral safe without a trusted third
[40:15] party and um um in the case of
[40:19] liquidation and you will have a theod
[40:21] chain and htlc oh my God is going
[40:24] technical I'm not the best on this on
[40:26] this stuff but
[40:28] htlc is Ash time locked
[40:31] contract and basically it can be
[40:34] unlocked it can be unlocked the money
[40:36] can be unlocked uh with the ash so same
[40:39] stuff cryptographic string cryptographic
[40:41] information or a time lock if after a
[40:45] certain time the the data is not given
[40:49] the string the cryptographic signature
[40:51] is not given then uh it will go on one
[40:54] side or the other so basically too bad I
[40:58] don't have a
[40:59] Blackboard uh Bob and Alis um Bob and
[41:02] Alis decide to to sign a
[41:06] contract um Alice will borrow and Bob
[41:09] will land Alice will put the collateral
[41:11] into a DLC and Bob will put some stable
[41:15] coins into a htlc on an
[41:17] nchain the DLC is here to prove the
[41:21] money um the loan has been
[41:24] collateralized and since you since uh
[41:27] Alice collateralized the DLC she will
[41:30] have a secret a cryptographic secret and
[41:33] then she will be able to unlock the
[41:35] money in the
[41:37] htlc if she doesn't collateralize if she
[41:40] don't she if she doesn't put the money
[41:42] into the DLC after a certain time then
[41:45] the htlc will be unlocked in favor of uh
[41:48] of Bob meaning she didn't put the money
[41:51] in Bob can take um can take the the
[41:54] money from the loan back was it clear I
[41:57] have not sure oh my God it's it's it
[42:00] gets clearer uh is that only working
[42:03] with stable coins like for example if
[42:05] the lender doesn't give me the the feat
[42:09] that I want uh that probably only works
[42:11] with with stable coins right it will
[42:14] never happen with with with Fiat okay
[42:18] the problem with Fiat it's a black box
[42:20] you will have to trust the bank you
[42:23] won't have any information from that
[42:25] bank you cannot basically ask them to
[42:27] have an API or an oracle or whatever
[42:31] they want to give you this information
[42:33] so with the bank you will be forced to
[42:36] work on an esquare model right
[42:39] everything needs to work fine and if
[42:42] [ __ ] [ __ ] it's the fan then you will
[42:45] have an escrow say hey prove me you sent
[42:47] the money to to the lender Etc so uh why
[42:52] that's that's an interesting question
[42:53] Robin uh why stable coins because St
[42:57] coins it's the same a stable coin is
[43:00] basically issued by a bank tether tether
[43:02] is a
[43:04] bank and they are operating on uh on alt
[43:07] chains we can discuss about it I don't
[43:09] trust them but uh if stable coins uh
[43:12] come to bitcoin with RGB or whatever we
[43:16] will integrate it happily anyways uh why
[43:20] with why with stable coins because
[43:21] stable coins would allow us to create
[43:25] this Synergy between between the DLC on
[43:28] bitcoin and the HT htlc on the AL chain
[43:32] meaning we can we can achieve trustless
[43:36] and automated um relationship between
[43:39] the lender and the borrower the
[43:41] transaction is basically per
[43:44] permissionless automated and trustless
[43:46] and this is the only way to achieve this
[43:48] without the middleman interesting so so
[43:52] it works better with the stable coins
[43:53] because you can cryptographically prove
[43:56] uh if money has moved and the fear as
[43:59] you said it's blackbox Ah
[44:02] that's we can also program uh it means
[44:05] like hglc on as I said the contract on
[44:09] lerat is GLC on um on bitcoin hlc on the
[44:13] AL chain and then we can program the
[44:16] relationship using both obviously it is
[44:19] transparent everyone can verify
[44:21] it and um yeah
[44:24] basically basically that's the way it
[44:26] works
[44:28] yeah turn those reactions for those
[44:30] people only listening uh he um science
[44:34] just showed me a thumb up and then like
[44:37] this bubble comes up I I always turn it
[44:39] off and sometimes it gets turned on
[44:41] again and I'm like like why is it now
[44:43] because my camera actually freezes once
[44:46] the reaction is triggered uh so like I
[44:49] have to then restart the camera and all
[44:51] the things so it's really annoying
[44:53] obviously with you it seems to work
[44:55] better like with me
[44:58] and
[44:59] um uh yeah I I think some something I
[45:03] haven't mentioned before because I
[45:06] mention alt chains people will think
[45:08] about yeah you know RV and other def
[45:12] protocols L theat does not work like
[45:15] that at all there's no pools of
[45:18] liquidity there's no there's no there's
[45:20] nothing comparable every contract is
[45:23] peer-to-peer and discrete no one knows
[45:26] about it
[45:27] and you cannot have exploits it's fixed
[45:30] terms basically if if I and you uh sign
[45:35] a contract using glender set only you
[45:38] and me will be able to know it even uh
[45:41] looking on chain is difficult to to know
[45:44] what's happening uh using discrete LW
[45:47] contracts that's why they are called
[45:49] discret and um yeah it's not um someone
[45:54] exterior could not exploit this
[45:56] relationship things uh the kind of
[45:58] things happening all the time in the def
[46:01] ecosystem because contracts are pools
[46:04] are commune to a lot of people and then
[46:07] it exposes you
[46:10] to counterparty risk smart contracts uh
[46:14] hack risk economic exploits chain risk
[46:18] with roll back or whatever on the L
[46:20] chains yeah thanks to the lender set
[46:23] system you're not exposed to all of this
[46:25] at least uh really cool and also it's
[46:28] probably also non KC and stuff like
[46:30] that well as I told you earlier um the
[46:33] goal is to have really a layer one of
[46:36] the protocol which is permissionless and
[46:39] permissionless means anyone can use it
[46:42] as long as you have um a Bitcoin and as
[46:46] long as you have stable coins you can
[46:48] use it uh without any
[46:52] further
[46:53] registration requirements let's say it
[46:56] like that of course over time and if we
[46:58] grow maybe we will have other layers it
[47:02] it won't be called layers right but
[47:04] maybe we will have for for institutional
[47:07] or for some types of customers kyc
[47:10] requirement or whatever maybe they will
[47:12] use as I told you spending tools and on
[47:17] ramp off ramps who are which which are
[47:20] um KY but it is really important for us
[47:23] to have a let's say a layer one which
[47:26] anyone can use without a kyc and if you
[47:30] don't trust us on
[47:32] that um we aim to build um an open
[47:37] source client an open source software
[47:39] client in the case of Doomsday in the
[47:43] case we're being forced to block people
[47:46] with with without a kyc or whatever to
[47:49] interact with the protocol without our
[47:51] front end so that's the end goal right
[47:53] okay so you are basically using an open
[47:56] source
[47:57] protocol and uh your client is just an
[48:02] one access point to that and everyone
[48:05] can access this layer one uh lenders app
[48:10] well to be 100% transparent for now we
[48:12] are in beta and uh yeah no the only the
[48:15] only way to access the protocol is using
[48:18] our our web our web app and front end of
[48:21] course but once we once we will go
[48:24] public and release the full protocol
[48:26] including dlc's including
[48:28] htlcs yes I I have personally opened
[48:32] issues to the devs so we can build a a
[48:36] client that anyone can um build at home
[48:39] and interact with the protocol without
[48:42] getting through our web app that's
[48:44] really important and I think it's also
[48:47] crucial to build a deep
[48:50] liquidity it's it's probably especially
[48:53] for the European guys uh something
[48:55] really interesting because there are
[48:56] more and more uh how is it called the M
[48:59] regulation and EU regulation coming down
[49:02] and people are worried okay like is is L
[49:05] sat and tomorrow still here uh and what
[49:09] what happens with that so you need kind
[49:11] of like those those
[49:14] tools uh I agree and uh one thing to
[49:17] know is that lat
[49:19] basically develops uh a protocol and
[49:23] this protocol is peer-to-peer so far the
[49:26] MAA MAA
[49:27] regulation um yeah peer-to-peer
[49:31] operation are not concerned by Mika
[49:34] regulations
[49:35] basically um our front end and yeah
[49:39] basically the client the web app is what
[49:42] we call a Blackboard we we
[49:45] don't we we do not take custody of the
[49:48] funds Etc so we are not directly
[49:51] concerned by the MAA
[49:53] regulation but not is more uncertain
[49:58] than
[49:59] regulation things can change from the
[50:01] day to the other so that's why I was
[50:04] talking about
[50:06] preventing um yeah for for for a
[50:08] potential doomsday or whatever uh we
[50:12] think it's important to have open open
[50:14] source and free software clients um that
[50:18] Europeans
[50:19] or anyone can use freely and transact
[50:24] with other people that will do the same
[50:28] as a European are you hopeful for the
[50:31] Bitcoin European uh
[50:33] future no not at all as an
[50:36] European
[50:38] I I would I would advise people to
[50:42] consider moving if they are working in
[50:44] this business moving
[50:47] abroad and if you're not moving abroad I
[50:49] would
[50:51] consider yeah
[50:52] basically
[50:54] find find ways to not being not being
[50:58] targeted by the
[51:00] regulations and all these all these all
[51:04] these problems I
[51:06] mean you know it you you're a bitcoiner
[51:09] as long as you're operating on
[51:10] peer-to-peer uh you don't have any
[51:13] troubles with these regulations so these
[51:16] regulations for now are the problem of
[51:18] the big platforms
[51:22] custodians you have you have a few
[51:25] non-custodial
[51:26] companies that are regulated and will be
[51:29] regulated as well but as an individual
[51:33] you should you should avoid um
[51:35] interacting with platforms as much as
[51:38] you
[51:40] can true true that um you're also um
[51:44] Consulting other Bitcoin companies
[51:46] you're also uh involved in other other
[51:49] things what else are you doing in in
[51:50] Bitcoin well uh it's been a while since
[51:53] I didn't do anything else than the let
[51:55] theat but before that I was Consulting
[51:57] for
[51:58] 10101 I think you received a Philip from
[52:01] 10101 on your podcast and basically we
[52:05] were building uh self
[52:07] custodial self custodial future uh um
[52:12] future contracts Bitcoin future trading
[52:16] right and I also consulted on a project
[52:20] linked to that which was the self cial
[52:24] USD um on light that we on Lightning
[52:28] self custo USD circulating on
[52:31] lightning and before that I worked with
[52:35] different companies for
[52:37] punctual uh missions which I won't
[52:40] disclose uh on this podcast which is
[52:43] fine oh and on the side I'm also an
[52:46] entrepreneur and I I uh I motivate
[52:49] everyone to do the same uh I got a
[52:52] personal take nothing nothing um nothing
[52:56] linked with the with lendat
[52:59] 10101 Robins here but I think Bitcoin is
[53:03] the best solution to try an ID as an
[53:07] entrepreneur before uh getting further
[53:10] if you if you have an ID you can try it
[53:13] on the internet and as long as you
[53:16] accept Bitcoin as a payment method you
[53:18] can try your ID um Benchmark it
[53:21] bootstrap it and then create a company
[53:24] later if if it works but
[53:27] I I think that's one of the most
[53:29] underrated featur of Bitcoin since it's
[53:33] permissionless you can yeah you can
[53:35] Benchmark and test
[53:38] um entrepreneurs uh ID companies ID
[53:43] brand ID just with a Bitcoin and a
[53:45] website basically so I created a brand a
[53:48] hot sauce brand called spice tshi and uh
[53:53] I sold hot sauce because I love hot
[53:55] sauce two bitcoiners and it worked well
[53:58] so far so then I'm considering opening a
[54:01] company uh and selling hot source for
[54:04] Bitcoin I love that yeah it's it's it's
[54:06] kind of a revolution of like you you
[54:08] just need a domain and the money part
[54:11] the money part is Bitcoin uh you don't
[54:14] need anything else like the company
[54:15] lives in cyberspace already if you have
[54:17] a domain and Bitcoin has uh your single
[54:20] Source or thing look so far uh with
[54:24] traditional payment processor you had
[54:26] you you it required you a company you
[54:29] you you needed to have a company right
[54:31] with Bitcoin you can install fixd I
[54:34] don't know if you know Fenix D but
[54:36] whatever any lightning payment processor
[54:39] you need a domain a good ID and with
[54:43] these three components you can start uh
[54:46] a company like a project let's say and
[54:49] Benchmark if it's um if it can make
[54:51] money if it works if people love it you
[54:55] can iterate until it works works and
[54:58] once you're satisfied then go for a
[55:00] company and and Go full speed but
[55:03] Bitcoin allows anyone to become a
[55:06] creator of value and an entrepreneur and
[55:08] I never hear that and I think it's one
[55:11] of the most important thing uh really
[55:14] cool um I asked each and every one of my
[55:17] guests uh one question and is the
[55:19] question of what can we learn from you
[55:21] besides Bitcoin wow that's a good
[55:24] question I I think I I will I would have
[55:27] stuff to teach um in Cuisine I'm a good
[55:31] cook um shout out to um to um satoshi's
[55:37] kitchen I wrote uh I wrote three recpes
[55:40] in his book it's a book um that was
[55:43] released for uh Christmas uh basically
[55:46] only bit Corners with
[55:49] Rees um a cookbook a cooking book I
[55:51] don't know how to say that in English
[55:53] but yeah it's a really cool project so
[55:55] yeah what what we can learn from me I
[55:58] guess I could teach two or three
[56:00] things uh in
[56:02] Cuisine uh in sports but uh yeah what
[56:08] what do you mean what can I what can we
[56:09] learn
[56:10] uh about me I think that was already
[56:14] good this this was already good we
[56:16] learned something new about you uh and
[56:19] people go in different directions with
[56:20] that question and you you kind of
[56:22] answered it already Okay yeah I I think
[56:25] I think uh
[56:26] okay I will go full speed in the
[56:28] direction I took previously but after
[56:31] Bitcoin and after money you need to
[56:35] reappropriate yourself your living
[56:38] including the food including what you
[56:42] buy to who you buy it and I think yeah
[56:47] yeah to me it's really important sport
[56:50] the body the health and um the food what
[56:54] do you buy what do you put in your body
[56:57] uh what food do you give to your
[56:59] children how is it cooked and don't TR
[57:03] verify there's no better way to do it
[57:05] than do it yourself I love that that's
[57:08] that's a that's a great saying um we
[57:11] have entertain in the podcast where the
[57:12] previous guest is asking a question for
[57:14] the next guest without knowing who the
[57:16] next guest actually is and the question
[57:17] from the previous guest is what is the
[57:20] silliest misconception you ever heard uh
[57:23] about Bitcoin from a non- coiner oh
[57:25] that's a one because I don't listen to
[57:28] no
[57:29] coiners
[57:31] um I would say the classic one right uh
[57:36] yeah Bitcoin Bitcoin sounds good but
[57:39] it's not real I love things that I can
[57:41] touch like you know
[57:44] BOS I hear that all the I hear that all
[57:46] the time maybe it's not the best but I
[57:48] think it's one of the yeah is the one I
[57:51] hate the most yeah that's that that's a
[57:54] really bad one like that's that's one
[57:56] that is really silly yeah thank you so
[57:58] much science for being on uh before I
[58:01] let you go where can people find you ask
[58:02] your questions and reach out to you well
[58:05] I'm uh I'm on X obviously uh science
[58:08] genial maybe you will tag me on that I
[58:11] have a podcast but it's in French I'm
[58:13] not sure your listeners will uh will
[58:16] come and enjoy but if they do uh my
[58:19] pleasure uh the podcast is called Le
[58:23] Bonker and we talk about uh travel uh
[58:27] traveling
[58:28] expatriation tax avoidance and
[58:31] Bitcoin and yeah basically that's it I'm
[58:34] on Noster as well and feel free to feel
[58:37] free to to send me a message if you have
[58:39] any question anything that would make me
[58:42] love I would love to receive your
[58:44] messages guys that's it I just looked it
[58:47] up I have 0.9% of my audience in France
[58:52] I I might be in this .9% not in life
[58:58] so there there are some uh some some
[59:00] people in France uh I think like around
[59:03] around a thousand people something like
[59:04] that uh but yeah it's it's it's uh it's
[59:07] it's a market that is a little bit
[59:10] smaller for me Germany is really good
[59:13] big also with 5% Australia is also good
[59:16] Canada obviously America and UK are the
[59:18] the two big ones but yeah thank you so
[59:21] much uh sence for being on thank you so
[59:22] much for for taking the time also thank
[59:24] you so much for everyone that is
