[00:00] if you want to stay poor that's fine as
[00:01] for me you know we're going to the Moon
[00:03] baby from the Millennials perspective
[00:05] Bitcoin is a way to retire financially
[00:09] from the bankers perspective Bitcoin is
[00:12] an attack on the existing Global
[00:15] Financial order this kind of objective
[00:18] nonpartisan Humanity agnostic
[00:21] information that flows every 10 minutes
[00:23] that is so huge Fiat will benefit by
[00:26] incorporating Bitcoin as indestructible
[00:29] digital collateral if you're not
[00:31] comfortable with the price going down
[00:33] 50% and just still holding it you
[00:35] shouldn't be buying it the only way to
[00:38] have your money match up with a
[00:41] objective sound monetary policy is
[00:43] through merging your money in your
[00:45] economic power with Bitcoin we're still
[00:47] very very early in this thing the best
[00:49] thing you can do is buy an hle you have
[00:52] $100,000 I mean yeah you can buy some
[00:54] stuff it's great but in comparison to
[00:56] the whole it's still you're like a
[00:58] little spec basically
[01:00] now take that and compare to the Bitcoin
[01:03] ecosystem you have $100,000 you convert
[01:05] it to 1.4 Bitcoins so you still have a
[01:08] very small percentage of the 21 million
[01:10] Bitcoins but your slice of the pie is
[01:13] much larger it's like 18 times
[01:16] [Music]
[01:20] larger I'm so passionate about the
[01:22] things that I do um it's very easy to to
[01:25] kind of get off on a tangent and um
[01:28] perhaps say things that I probably
[01:30] shouldn't be saying in front of the
[01:31] entire world on your podcast but you
[01:34] know as I mentioned earlier you know I'm
[01:35] a lawyer you know I can't this is not
[01:37] legal advice it's just you know my
[01:39] commentary on bitcoin broad you know
[01:42] there the comments are my own my
[01:43] statements are my own they don't
[01:44] represent any organization or any
[01:46] employer is
[01:47] that is that sometimes uh difficult like
[01:51] uh having to be very careful what you
[01:54] say like I I really like that I just
[01:56] like speak what I I think I mean I'm
[01:58] also getting more and more aware of more
[02:01] and more people listening to me every
[02:02] day and this is a huge influence and
[02:04] there's like some some kind of
[02:05] responsibility there but I always think
[02:08] like as long as you stay true to
[02:10] yourself um and say what you mean and
[02:13] don't like put anything out there uh
[02:16] then it's okay to rant it then it's okay
[02:18] to to go through your passion and maybe
[02:20] you're wrong at that time and maybe you
[02:22] learn something new later but is there
[02:24] like is there actually like I don't know
[02:27] with legal consequences but is there
[02:28] actual legal consequences if you say
[02:30] something on a Bitcoin podcast and
[02:32] people like oh I acted on that it's like
[02:34] I I don't know the law so like uh was
[02:37] never confronted with that topic yeah I
[02:39] mean I I I think if you say something uh
[02:41] as an attorney uh that is um fraudulent
[02:46] or misleading or um hold yourself out to
[02:50] be something that you're not um like
[02:53] let's say I I go out there and you know
[02:55] I'm I'm speaking about Bitcoin and
[02:58] finances and the Central Bank and you
[03:01] know the stocks and bonds and you know I
[03:04] I don't say and make it clear that I'm a
[03:06] I'm not a financial adviser this is not
[03:08] what I'm an expert in but then I at the
[03:10] same time say something to the effect of
[03:13] um yeah you should buy this or you know
[03:15] if you buy Bitcoin the the numbers just
[03:17] going to go up you know and it's going
[03:20] to go up forever you know uh I I think
[03:22] that somebody who took action on those
[03:26] comments I think could potentially file
[03:29] a complaint against me uh with you know
[03:31] my State Bar or try to come after me
[03:35] personally in some other way so I you
[03:38] know when you have a license uh to
[03:41] practice law uh you have to you know
[03:44] adhere to these professional rules and
[03:46] very similar to like being a doctor you
[03:48] know or being a nurse uh you know if
[03:52] you're a nurse for example you have a
[03:53] license but you don't have a license to
[03:55] practice medicine this is a area of
[03:57] special expertise it's an area that has
[04:00] consequence uh in the real world uh to
[04:03] people uh and to their welfare uh and so
[04:07] you don't want to uh hold yourself out
[04:09] to be something that you're not and I
[04:11] think that is really at the core of of
[04:14] why we say those things like you know
[04:16] this is not legal advice these are just
[04:18] my personal statements um now I think
[04:21] you can go overboard with it you know
[04:23] and a lot of people do you know they'll
[04:25] say something to the effect of you know
[04:26] this is not Financial advice you know
[04:29] and they're just talking about how great
[04:30] silver is and it's like okay like if
[04:33] you're dumb enough to like buy silver
[04:36] based on somebody saying how great
[04:37] silver or silver coin is then you
[04:40] probably deserve to get dumped
[04:42] on so then then then let's make the the
[04:45] disclaimer today uh in this episode
[04:48] there's nothing of financial advice and
[04:50] no legal advice and I don't know maybe
[04:53] it comes up there's also no medical
[04:55] advice
[04:56] here well we did talk about hair loss
[04:59] initially
[05:00] yeah true that's not recorded but was
[05:04] recorded but nothing like that um
[05:07] there's actually one legal topic maybe
[05:09] we can get into Bitcoin if if you can
[05:11] answer that or if you're comfortable
[05:13] sharing that or if there is even answer
[05:15] to that because there is big people with
[05:19] big responsibilities like a Michael
[05:20] sailor who publicly says very often
[05:23] Bitcoin goes up forever like there's
[05:25] even this like it goes up forever Laura
[05:28] me kind of like that um and it's it's
[05:31] fascinating how how how how this works
[05:34] and how people can say that about
[05:36] Bitcoin but not about stocks and it's
[05:39] it's it's like there's like a whole
[05:40] whole thing around that uh one thing
[05:42] that was also explained to me by a
[05:43] lawyer once he basically said it's also
[05:46] uh makes a big difference uh the context
[05:49] of where you say it if if it's like on a
[05:51] on a podcast where just scream on the
[05:53] Internet or if it's like an an intimate
[05:56] setting where you actually speak to
[05:58] individual people this makes a lot of
[06:00] difference uh and it can go yeah exactly
[06:05] so like for the bitcoiners out there and
[06:08] for the maybe the the influencers out
[06:11] there that talk about Bitcoin and a lot
[06:13] of people that watch this podcast I know
[06:16] are posting on Twitter and this can also
[06:19] already be considered an influencer what
[06:22] what should we be aware of when we talk
[06:23] about Bitcoin is there anything that
[06:25] you're like oh like this could actually
[06:27] come back at us as bit us well I I you
[06:30] know it's an interesting question
[06:32] because I think it kind of blurs a line
[06:34] between free speech at least in the
[06:35] United States and uh commentary uh or as
[06:40] some would say uh just you know I guess
[06:44] uh maybe advertising in some respects uh
[06:47] in some contexts uh and uh informed uh
[06:52] or legal advice or financial advice
[06:54] ordinarily if we're giving advice uh
[06:57] that would be specific to your situation
[07:00] uh to your financial posture uh to your
[07:05] legal issues uh after some sort of uh
[07:09] Gathering of facts right and so the
[07:12] concern is is that some of the
[07:14] commentary I think and some of the
[07:15] posting and some of the proclamations
[07:19] for example like bitcoin's going to go
[07:20] forever right you don't know that right
[07:24] and we don't know what the end result or
[07:26] consequence to those statements will be
[07:27] at this time right so uh there there
[07:31] have been folks uh in this industry
[07:34] particularly for example with the
[07:36] icos uh and um with the exchanges that
[07:40] made statements and made promises right
[07:42] and they were prosecuted and some of
[07:44] them were put in jail right and so I
[07:47] think it's it's really up to the speaker
[07:51] uh in terms of I think a good analysis
[07:53] is one do you do you have a license to
[07:57] say the things that you're saying right
[07:59] or specific to individuals right so if I
[08:02] said something to the effect of um you
[08:05] know single families you know raising
[08:07] two kids you really you you'd be really
[08:10] dumb not to buy you know two Bitcoins
[08:12] for each of your children uh for their
[08:14] University education right so I
[08:18] personally if I was a financial adviser
[08:21] or as a lawyer I would never say
[08:22] something like that uh and the reason
[08:25] why is because you know I hold a license
[08:28] right in parts duties and
[08:30] responsibilities on me to kind of to
[08:33] watch what I say out in the public
[08:35] domain and um that type of curated
[08:40] advice to like a family with two
[08:42] children uh without knowing the larger
[08:45] context and details of what that family
[08:47] is going through uh and what their uh
[08:51] expenses are or what kind of University
[08:53] or CH wants to go to I think that would
[08:56] be irresponsible statement by a
[08:58] financial visor and also bu a lawyer as
[09:01] well um now if I'm just some guy you
[09:05] know um I don't have a license I don't
[09:08] have a business right no one's going to
[09:11] come after me uh if I if I say something
[09:15] like that or the risk of somebody coming
[09:18] after me if I say something like that is
[09:19] probably very low um so it it really is
[09:24] up to the speaker in terms of whether
[09:25] they want to have a conversation with
[09:27] their friend which is different as you
[09:29] mentioned earlier the context or post
[09:31] something on Twitter where with a global
[09:33] audience right every person if you have
[09:37] if you're married and you have a child
[09:38] or two children you'd be a fool not to
[09:40] buy Bitcoin today and hold one Bitcoin
[09:43] for that child's
[09:44] education that that's just my risk
[09:48] adverse approach to statements um when
[09:52] making statements online particularly if
[09:55] you're a professional versus if you're
[09:57] just if you're just a person out there
[09:58] that's making
[10:00] statements it's it's it it can be kind
[10:03] of weedy basically is what I'm trying to
[10:05] say um and I what I try to do is stay
[10:08] away from
[10:09] that I think that's that's probably a
[10:12] good idea interesting enough is um how
[10:16] many Bitcoin you should hold and uh
[10:20] where the Bitcoin pric is going are the
[10:22] two most clicked uh video title
[10:25] thumbnails ever like if you put
[10:27] something like that together I mean
[10:29] other topics that are really popular but
[10:31] those two are like really popular if you
[10:33] put like numbers on on the T and the
[10:34] thumbnail and you make a video around
[10:36] that and that's why a lot people
[10:37] actually also do it and it's funny that
[10:40] those are like the the the kind of hard
[10:43] topics to discuss because you have to
[10:45] come with a lot of disclaimers with that
[10:47] uh and especially interesting I find it
[10:50] always like when we talk about oh yeah a
[10:53] bitcoin price is going uh in that time
[10:56] frame to that price I'm like you have no
[10:58] clue if this actually happen like if you
[11:00] say just like in the line like oh
[11:01] Bitcoin is going up forever then it's
[11:03] like okay yeah like first you can never
[11:06] prove that it's it's it's wrong because
[11:08] you put such a long time Horizon on that
[11:11] that yeah like maybe it's now down but
[11:14] it's going up forever so like after that
[11:16] it goes goes up again like it's like
[11:18] really hard to to prove but if you go
[11:20] put like a time constraint on it like
[11:21] yeah 2025 in Q4 Bitcoin will go to
[11:25] 100,500
[11:27] EUR uh and and that's why you should now
[11:30] buy one Bitcoin like that's that that
[11:32] would be an a bad statement probably to
[11:35] make uh and if someone wants to go after
[11:38] you that the prob can especially if you
[11:40] have a license then you're more um I
[11:42] guess more attackable in in in that
[11:44] sense but yeah that's that was not the
[11:46] qu not the topic that I wanted to get
[11:48] get into with you but it I think it's
[11:50] really interesting and I never had it on
[11:51] the podcast so I was like let's let's go
[11:54] go a little bit in there yeah no that's
[11:56] fine absolutely really cool uh the first
[11:58] question that actually wanted to ask you
[12:00] is um you had an interesting article
[12:03] where you described what Bitcoin is and
[12:05] i i l that's a lot a lot that you put
[12:07] the different perspectives in there so
[12:09] like first for for the people that don't
[12:10] know the article what did you write in
[12:12] there what is bitcoin for
[12:15] you so yeah the article uh I WR first
[12:18] the timing of the article is really
[12:19] important so I believe I wrote it in
[12:22] 2019 so I've been in the bitco and
[12:25] ecosystem since late
[12:27] 2017 uh bought at the all-time high
[12:30] right at
[12:32] $199,000 uh and but unlike most people
[12:35] I'm not a Trader per se I'm much more of
[12:37] an investor so I bought out the all-time
[12:39] high in 20 uh late 2017 right around
[12:42] Christmas uh I believe it was 2017 uh
[12:45] and then 2018 I studied the hell out of
[12:49] Bitcoin uh now rewinding to
[12:52] 2012 I think it was I saw I watched a
[12:56] couple of uh uh documentaries about
[12:58] Bitcoin I was in law school but the
[13:01] first inclination from the the uh
[13:04] documentaries from 2012 was that this
[13:06] thing is not going to work uh it is um
[13:10] too energy hungry um it is not a
[13:13] currency it's just you know weird you
[13:15] know experimentation of of of software
[13:19] uh fast forward 2017 my buddy's making
[13:22] thousands of dollars based on bitcoin
[13:25] I'm not making that money I'm investing
[13:27] in stocks uh bonds things like that but
[13:32] unlike some of the other traders who
[13:33] kind of sold out uh uh when the price
[13:36] started to dump I continued to buy so I
[13:38] was dollar cost averaging on the bottom
[13:41] I bought the bottom at
[13:43] $3,000 uh I continued to do the research
[13:48] uh and Anthony poano with the pop
[13:51] podcast was uh one of the uh podcasts
[13:55] that I watched
[13:57] religiously and uh one of and also the
[14:01] what Bitcoin did podcast uh was was
[14:04] another can't remember that guy's name
[14:06] right now but you probably can Peter
[14:08] McCormick yeah yeah Peter McCormick yeah
[14:11] so Peter McCormick with the what Bitcoin
[14:12] did podcast was also and I actually uh
[14:15] watched him religiously as well and the
[14:20] P podcast he would ask people when they
[14:22] came on what is
[14:24] bitcoin and I thought it was fascinating
[14:26] because he had this kind of constant
[14:28] theme with every podcast and you ask
[14:31] people what is bitcoin and I noticed
[14:33] that the the answers started to diverge
[14:36] based on the perspective of the the the
[14:39] holder right um and so that kind of got
[14:43] me to think about okay what is I'm going
[14:45] to write this article uh it's going to
[14:48] be what is bitcoin and what I'm going to
[14:50] do is try to make a little bit kind of
[14:52] fun and and artistic and and so that's
[14:56] what the article is the article goes
[14:57] into what is bitcoin from different
[15:00] perspectives uh so for example I think I
[15:02] put in there from the Millennials
[15:04] perspective Bitcoin
[15:06] is a way uh to retire
[15:11] financially uh from the Banker's
[15:13] perspective Bitcoin is uh an attack on
[15:17] the existing Global Financial order uh
[15:22] from the uh coders perspective uh
[15:26] Bitcoin is you know a a way to solve the
[15:31] the uh the problem the double spend
[15:34] problem right and so the the the article
[15:39] goes into I think I must have listed
[15:41] like 25 articles uh or 25 viewpoints in
[15:44] there I don't have the article in front
[15:45] of me so I I came unprepared of course
[15:48] uh
[15:49] but that's that's the gist of the
[15:52] article is
[15:54] uh understanding that Bitcoin uh in a in
[15:58] a lot of ways
[15:59] depends on who you are and and its value
[16:02] I think depends on who you are as well
[16:05] so we see this you know now with some of
[16:08] the holders uh that are holding or
[16:11] hodlers I should say that are hodling uh
[16:14] for retirement and so I I'm part of that
[16:18] uh cohort uh and then you see um some
[16:23] others like the ETF managers uh Black
[16:27] Rock and Larry I think they see the
[16:29] writing on the wall that this asset uh
[16:33] or this technology I should say uh is
[16:36] something that is definitely not going
[16:39] to be going away and it's it's growing
[16:41] it's going to continue to permeate
[16:43] throughout societal society and so oh
[16:46] here's the article right here
[16:49] so uh so let's see I I lost the last one
[16:52] I love the last one to the grandma
[16:54] Bitcoin is a new form of money that my
[16:56] grandson told me to buy sure why not I
[16:59] trust him more than I trust Bankers I I
[17:01] guess he bitcoiner all bitcoiners trust
[17:04] bitcoiners more than
[17:06] Bankers oh yeah I mean and you know the
[17:09] grandparents and the the the elders in
[17:12] society like myself you know I'm I'm
[17:14] over 40 now not quite 50 but I'm I'm I'm
[17:18] getting to that point where I'm starting
[17:20] to look at really you know getting my um
[17:25] like a squirrel with acorns you know
[17:27] just kind of holding on to
[17:29] because you know life can happen at any
[17:31] time and you just never know when you're
[17:33] going to need that extra form of cash uh
[17:37] but you know with the elders who are
[17:39] like you know in their 80s first of all
[17:41] folks are living a lot longer now than
[17:43] they ever have right there there's
[17:45] plenty of documentaries out there that
[17:47] go over uh living longer and and just
[17:50] people are living longer like in the 9s
[17:53] and hundreds and and we haven't even
[17:55] gotten to the point where AI is general
[17:58] or s Cent uh but I think it could
[18:01] possibly happen in our lifetimes uh
[18:03] where AI is cured cancer where AI has
[18:07] assisted Humanity with Gene editing for
[18:10] example or I think it's called crisper
[18:13] uh where technology is is at a point
[18:16] where it it allows people to live even
[18:20] longer than they ever have uh and you
[18:23] know I think there are some folks out
[18:25] there who are really focusing on you
[18:27] know how to live longer you know more
[18:30] Fuller life uh or Fuller life rather so
[18:33] that's really what the bottom one was is
[18:35] to the grandma bigcoin is a new form of
[18:37] money that my grandson told me told me
[18:39] to buy uh they've lived they've lived a
[18:42] life man I mean these older you know I
[18:44] was raised by my grandparents uh and so
[18:47] when I was younger in high school and so
[18:50] a week did not go by that my grandfather
[18:52] or my grandmother wouldn't say out loud
[18:54] in the house they're all Crooks you know
[18:57] these people are Crooks you know the the
[18:59] the bankers that is uh because they've
[19:02] seen the you know Savings and Loan
[19:04] crisis you know they've seen you know
[19:07] their stocks totally
[19:09] implode um you know for my generation in
[19:12] 200 I believe it was 2008 I lived
[19:15] through the financial crisis you know
[19:17] and you know the Central Bank you know
[19:20] printed all this money out of thin air
[19:23] you know they engaged in what they call
[19:24] quantitative easing and they just you
[19:26] know issued all these bonds that they
[19:29] bought themselves I think the right hand
[19:31] was shaking the left hand and they were
[19:33] just there's just this circle circular
[19:36] Bond cash movement and I guess it worked
[19:40] uh I mean we have inflation that is a
[19:43] problem now uh but you know I don't
[19:45] think you can print all that cash and
[19:48] have it just go to the top 1% and the
[19:50] ultra wealthy and and you know not have
[19:52] any ramifications as a consequence to
[19:55] that I think what really ended up
[19:57] happening though uh was the Bitcoin
[19:59] white paper that you know was issued
[20:01] right after the financial crisis I
[20:03] believe in 2008 or
[20:05] 2009 I don't think they could have seen
[20:07] that so I think that was kind of a a
[20:10] Black Swan for them and when I say them
[20:12] I mean the the
[20:14] shareholders uh whether they be families
[20:18] or nation states or the the the people
[20:22] who primarily own and control Central
[20:25] Banking um and there's there's a lot of
[20:28] rumors as far as who owns what um so I
[20:31] don't want to get into that but what I
[20:33] do want to get into is I think now more
[20:36] than ever with the Advent of the
[20:38] internet and the socialization of
[20:40] information we're in a place where
[20:43] seeing behind a fraudulent veil of uh
[20:47] security a fraudulent veil of
[20:51] financial um
[20:53] Integrity uh is is very clear I think
[20:56] people can see really clearly what their
[20:58] eyes with a click of a mouse or just a
[21:00] little research um that there's
[21:03] Shenanigans going on with with with the
[21:06] banking system uh and that um that it's
[21:09] not as open and free as we thought it
[21:11] was uh that U so-called free markets you
[21:15] know that a lot of people died for in
[21:18] history right um that they're not as
[21:21] free as we thought they were um that
[21:23] that there's quite a bit of manipulation
[21:26] uh interest rate targeting
[21:28] um I some of the podcasters that I
[21:31] listen to I like when they say that it's
[21:34] a a managed economy that the economy is
[21:37] managed the money is managed right it's
[21:39] not a free floating system per se um
[21:42] there's the objective and then there's
[21:44] like trying to get to the objective like
[21:46] I think right now the objective is uh
[21:48] trying to decrease inflation right um
[21:53] but what I also noticed is that there's
[21:56] there's counterproductive interest
[21:59] so there's more spending right so the
[22:02] inflation reduction act it's a great
[22:04] example we'll pass a bill we'll spend
[22:07] you know a trillion dollars and we'll
[22:09] call it the inflation reduction act so I
[22:12] I think that's really fascinating
[22:14] because you know people there genuinely
[22:17] people still believe that that will that
[22:20] that bill is intended to reduce
[22:22] inflation maybe it was maybe it does I I
[22:25] personally you know as an over 40y old I
[22:27] I I I find it very difficult to believe
[22:30] that that passing a bill like that would
[22:31] reduce inflation um anyway sorry like I
[22:36] rant right there I I love it so much
[22:39] because it's it's uh like like spending
[22:43] money like creating money out of fin air
[22:45] the very reason why we have inflation
[22:47] and they try to with more spending uh
[22:52] counteract uh inflation that like it's
[22:56] it's like you hit your toe and you toe
[22:58] hurts because of that and in order to
[23:01] not uh be hurt on the toe you hit your
[23:04] toe even more like like that that
[23:07] doesn't make any sense there not a
[23:08] better comparison to that it's it's
[23:11] great and and people actually yeah yeah
[23:13] we should we should spend a lot of money
[23:15] to uh fight against inflation like
[23:17] inflation is some sort of like uh
[23:20] terrorist attack which which like comes
[23:23] to our country and and we have to fight
[23:25] them with like armor or something like
[23:27] that like not work like that it's so
[23:30] funny how how people's brain work if
[23:33] they don't understand how money actually
[23:36] works there's a lot of people I think if
[23:38] you go out there uh and ask people
[23:42] randomly if the inflation reduction act
[23:44] actually will impact inflation uh in a
[23:47] positive way most people probably will
[23:50] say yes it's it's a sad sad state that
[23:53] we are current I feel like yeah you know
[23:56] and I I think I think the so people see
[24:00] it on a day-to-day basis so the the CPI
[24:03] the Consumer Price Index right which
[24:05] from what I understand I'm certainly no
[24:07] expert but from what I understand the
[24:09] the actual end result of the CPI is this
[24:13] number that doesn't actually serve a
[24:14] good purpose right because it's missing
[24:17] a lot of really important metrics it's
[24:19] missing the cost of food it's missing
[24:21] the cost of energy it's missing the cost
[24:23] of housing it's missing the cost of the
[24:27] the um
[24:29] the uh cost of of of holding a bill for
[24:33] example like let's say you have student
[24:34] loans or let's say you have credit card
[24:36] debt right the the CPI is not going to
[24:39] reflect those real tangible costs uh
[24:43] that the consumer has to bear I think
[24:46] Child Care like if you from what I hear
[24:48] I don't have children but from what I
[24:49] hear in the United States if you have a
[24:51] child I mean it's like $500 a week
[24:54] sometimes to have child care while you
[24:56] go to work I mean that just insane I
[24:59] mean does the CPI include that and if it
[25:02] doesn't should it right that we we need
[25:05] to have a better metric in terms of how
[25:10] how government extracts data that is
[25:13] valuable to markets I think that that's
[25:16] a very very big statement I don't want
[25:18] to get too deep into it but that that's
[25:20] my sense right and again I'm not an
[25:22] economist uh but my sense is that the
[25:25] data is just bad data in bad data out is
[25:28] what we're living through right now so
[25:31] kind of looping it back to
[25:33] bitcoin is one of the things that I
[25:35] really like about Bitcoin and among many
[25:38] other things is that it's absolute true
[25:40] data right so you have the 21 million
[25:42] cap right you have money coming in you
[25:44] have money coming out you have the
[25:46] Satoshi right you have a constant $21
[25:49] million or excuse me 21 million Bitcoin
[25:52] cap uh and then you have the Satoshi
[25:55] that are Incorporated in a single
[25:56] Bitcoin I mean and then you have the
[25:58] blockchain the open public Ledger that
[26:01] you can go and see for
[26:03] yourself uh that is verified about every
[26:06] 10 minutes right um by the miners and so
[26:10] this kind of objective
[26:12] nonpartisan um Humanity agnostic
[26:16] information that flows every 10 minutes
[26:20] uh you know Tik Tock next block uh
[26:22] that's huge that is so huge because it's
[26:27] it's a it's a measuring state that we
[26:28] can measure how much our money is really
[26:32] worth right and so that's why that's why
[26:35] I believe partly why not fully why but I
[26:37] think that's partly why the number
[26:38] continues to go up yeah for me uh
[26:41] Bitcoin like inflation rate is what you
[26:45] buy and for me Bitcoin is the inflation
[26:47] rate like I I I I with most of my money
[26:51] that comes in I buy Bitcoin uh and so
[26:55] Bitcoin is kind of the inflation rate
[26:57] that's why I also think it's stupid to
[27:00] measure an all-time high and adjust it
[27:03] to inflation like a lot of people say
[27:05] like no we did not hit an alltime high
[27:07] in 2024 in in April there because you
[27:11] have to adjust it for inflation I'm like
[27:13] what why do we have to adjust on bitcoin
[27:17] price to inflation that does not make
[27:19] any sense for me because I see Bitcoin
[27:21] as the hurdle rate as the inflation rate
[27:23] kind of uh because with a lot of money I
[27:26] buy uh Bitcoin on a regular basis but I
[27:30] like one thing that you said earlier and
[27:31] I really want to highlight that uh you
[27:34] saw Bitcoin specifically the Bitcoin
[27:36] white paper as the Black Swan event for
[27:40] central banks I I love that so so much
[27:43] because they couldn't see that coming
[27:46] and the the very thing that was um like
[27:50] without Bitcoin they can just do their
[27:53] thing till the end of time basically
[27:56] because they can always reinvent
[27:58] currencies they can reinstate trust but
[28:00] with Bitcoin we have kind of this fire
[28:02] alarm for the feat currency which is
[28:05] like oh yeah like if Bitcoin goes to a
[28:07] million or goes to two million this
[28:09] shows like how bad the feat system
[28:12] actually looks like I love the the this
[28:15] this uh different Viewpoint I never
[28:17] heard that Bitcoin is the black one EV
[28:20] event for central bank so I just wanted
[28:22] to to highlight that because I think
[28:24] it's a great perspective to look at
[28:26] Bitcoin yeah you know I I think it kind
[28:29] of boils down to to disruption
[28:31] technological disruption uh and for
[28:35] folks who are as old as me over 40 I
[28:37] mean we remember when we were children
[28:39] we'd go to Blockbuster to rent a movie
[28:42] right Blockbuster Video I don't know if
[28:44] they have it in where you're at but uh
[28:47] you know you walk in you get a big black
[28:49] VHS tape you know and then you rent it
[28:52] for two days and you bring it back and
[28:54] you drive back and forth and it was like
[28:56] a family trip you know they they had
[28:58] candy and you know popcorn and then
[29:00] Netflix came out right and so it was
[29:02] like okay what is this Netflix thing and
[29:04] then it had like the CDs so you had like
[29:07] DVD CDs that would come out uh and you
[29:10] know they were male so it was great we
[29:12] didn't have to like we could just cook
[29:14] dinner at home and we didn't have to
[29:15] like go to Blockbuster you just you know
[29:17] have a Netflix video in your queue and
[29:21] you know it would be there where you
[29:23] when you got home from work this is
[29:24] awesome
[29:25] right and then they got rid of the CDs
[29:29] and now we just have streaming Netflix
[29:31] streaming right and you can from what I
[29:34] uh I think also there are some other
[29:36] streaming services where you can buy the
[29:38] movie that is out you know in theaters
[29:40] right now right so the there's this
[29:43] there's just condensation of technology
[29:46] and information flow that we are still
[29:48] very we as society and Humanity I
[29:51] believe we are still very much going
[29:53] through right now and it's and once you
[29:56] start to see these trends it's easier to
[29:59] kind of see the next Trend so I put on
[30:02] my uh Bitcoin in 30 minutes uh YouTube
[30:06] uh channel that I've created I think I
[30:08] have like three or four videos up there
[30:10] but the intent with those videos was to
[30:12] condense Bitcoin down into 30 minutes so
[30:16] that folks could kind of take bite-sized
[30:18] pieces of it uh mostly because you know
[30:20] a lot of people have like attention
[30:22] spans of gats but also because it's it's
[30:25] kind of a complex topic and these these
[30:27] complex topics
[30:28] uh you know you want to try to condense
[30:31] them down to 30 minutes right maybe even
[30:33] less if you can but I have one of them
[30:35] in there it's called you know why
[30:37] Bitcoin won't just go away and I compare
[30:39] Bitcoin to uh the invention of railroad
[30:42] tracks this idea that you have two steel
[30:45] beams that are going along you know this
[30:48] this this higher elevation and you have
[30:51] these these steel wheels that you know
[30:53] are along the two parallel steel beams
[30:56] right with some sort of like
[30:58] uh Power uh steam generated power or
[31:01] some other maybe electrical generated
[31:03] power I think there are some electrical
[31:05] trains now of course um but the idea is
[31:08] that the invention itself right the the
[31:10] railroad tracks it it is it is there to
[31:14] serve a useful purpose right so the
[31:17] utility people often say Bitcoin is is
[31:20] useless you can't use it for anything
[31:22] right I think the accurate statement is
[31:26] Bitcoin largely and this is going to be
[31:29] in my next video that I come out with
[31:31] largely cannot be largely is not used
[31:33] for goods and services in the real
[31:35] economy and you know people like a lot
[31:37] of Bitcoin look oh I can't believe we
[31:39] said that but it's true like we use cash
[31:42] we use you know venmo things like that
[31:44] mostly in the United States primarily
[31:47] because there's a tax implication if you
[31:48] use Bitcoin to purchase goods and
[31:50] services uh but I guess the point I'm
[31:52] trying to make is when it comes to
[31:54] bitcoin right its utility is real road
[31:58] tracks and I don't think that central
[32:00] banks kind of looping it all the way
[32:02] back to what we mentioned earlier I
[32:04] don't think that central banks could
[32:06] have seen that their uh the the
[32:09] financial system and the entire monetary
[32:12] policy that comes with our existing
[32:14] Financial system has totally been
[32:16] disrupted by Bitcoin by technology by
[32:20] open-source software that says no the
[32:23] monetary policy is not going to be
[32:25] infinite debt and infinite cash right
[32:27] which is the current monetary policy
[32:29] infinite debt infinite cash I mean the
[32:31] the central banks have Bankers have have
[32:33] got up there and and said it
[32:35] explicitly and also you know the
[32:38] monetary policy is not going to be hey
[32:39] we're going to give you a special deal
[32:41] off out out of this window if you're a
[32:43] big bank and you're too big to fail and
[32:45] you know no we're not doing that like
[32:48] the monetary policy is going to be this
[32:50] objective sound money that is 21 million
[32:53] cap that a lot of people already have it
[32:55] right like you have some I have some
[32:58] Michael saor has probably a lot you know
[33:01] and that's just an option it's going to
[33:04] be I I disagree with some people that
[33:07] say Okay Bitcoin is going to replace
[33:08] Fiat right I think that what's going to
[33:11] end up happening in the medium term is
[33:14] that we will have an environment where
[33:17] Bitcoin has a parallel ecosystem to Fiat
[33:22] like the two will exist together uh and
[33:27] I think at some point the two will have
[33:29] or formulate kind of like a symbiotic
[33:32] relationship with each other like Fiat
[33:34] will benefit by incorporating Bitcoin as
[33:38] indestructible digital collateral and
[33:41] Bitcoin will benefit by by being able to
[33:45] be transact transacted in a synthetic
[33:48] Fiat token so for example like a US
[33:52] dollar coin or whatever I mean is that a
[33:54] cbdc h i don't know I mean maybe yes
[33:58] know but I guess the point I'm trying to
[33:59] make is from the from the perspective of
[34:02] the BL Swan um that Bitcoin was for
[34:04] Central
[34:05] Banking I think eventually it was going
[34:09] to happen right that Engineers software
[34:13] developers uh thinkers tinkerers would
[34:17] get fed up with their uh their savings
[34:22] uh their economic purchasing power uh
[34:24] being diluted and being stolen through
[34:27] taxation ation or through inflation and
[34:30] that there would be a techn technology
[34:32] solution if not just a technology
[34:35] partial solution right uh which I think
[34:38] is Bitcoin I partnered up with coin
[34:41] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[34:44] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[34:46] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[34:49] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[34:52] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[34:55] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[34:58] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[35:01] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[35:04] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[35:07] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[35:10] watch collections you have the date of
[35:13] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[35:16] there and of course also the block
[35:18] height and which EPO we are currently in
[35:22] I love the level of detail they put in
[35:24] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[35:27] check those amazing coin vigilante time
[35:30] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[35:33] those watches so so much if you watch or
[35:36] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[35:39] I'll guess you already bought some
[35:41] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[35:43] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[35:47] in a hardware wallet my personal
[35:49] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[35:51] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[35:53] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[35:55] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[35:58] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[36:02] with the code Robin at the checkout
[36:04] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[36:08] your bitbox and the next step is to
[36:11] really level up your sovereignty as an
[36:13] individual you have to have the most
[36:15] secure self custody setup you have to
[36:18] secure your own devices you have to
[36:21] protect your privacy you have to set up
[36:24] an inheritance plan and depending on
[36:26] where you live you even want to have a
[36:28] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[36:31] in case something goes really really
[36:33] wrong and through all those steps the
[36:35] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[36:38] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[36:41] way.com
[36:42] Partners Robin you even get a 30 minute
[36:45] free call to find out how you can level
[36:48] up your
[36:51] sovereignty I I I love that a lot with
[36:54] the digital rail world and and
[36:58] also how like uh Bitcoin is interacting
[37:02] especially in the medium term with uh
[37:04] the Fiat system because you still have
[37:07] volatility in purchasing power of
[37:10] Bitcoin uh which makes it hard to take
[37:13] as your unit of account for businesses
[37:17] uh for example I accept payments uh with
[37:19] my SP Partners in Bitcoin most of them
[37:22] pay in Bitcoin but we still set the
[37:24] price in uh Euros or dollars because
[37:28] uh that would just be like very like you
[37:31] said it at one point and then it like
[37:33] goes down and up like I mean kind of the
[37:35] same thing if we pay in there but we set
[37:37] the price still in in US dollars so
[37:39] volatility is still a thing that will go
[37:42] away at some point but right now it's
[37:44] reality then taxes uh is also still a
[37:48] reality uh that's just a legal thing and
[37:50] the other thing is also it's not widely
[37:53] accepted by everyone like we have to do
[37:54] a lot of Education still but I I think
[37:57] Bitcoin is perfect money but we have a
[38:00] long way that everyone also agrees and
[38:05] sees it and implements it in that way
[38:08] and I think in the medium term actually
[38:10] we will have we already have a hybrid
[38:13] between Fiat and and and Bitcoin because
[38:16] people already use Bitcoin as a minium
[38:18] exchange uni of account uh not a lot but
[38:20] some do and uh most of them do Fiat so
[38:23] like we already have the hybrid but this
[38:26] like 99% Fiat and % Bitcoin will
[38:29] probably uh come to a more balanced view
[38:31] at and then some point will will jump
[38:34] over I don't know if if Bitcoin ever
[38:36] will completely ER erode feeld I have
[38:39] I've like I struggle with that question
[38:41] so so much and I ask a lot of people on
[38:44] on the show uh and there are so many
[38:46] different answers coming so I have no
[38:48] clue uh on that regard but I like also
[38:51] how
[38:52] you uh say Bitcoin are digital railroads
[38:56] how do you think Bitcoin will change how
[38:59] we how we move things things like money
[39:03] with assets and in general how how will
[39:06] Bitcoin impact that well I think it's
[39:08] already happening I think that the the
[39:12] truckers in Canada was a great example
[39:15] about how the the the state the nation
[39:20] state could For Better or Worse like
[39:22] ethically or not ethically ostracize and
[39:25] cancel uh groups that it disagrees with
[39:27] with uh I think that's that's uh maybe
[39:31] not disagrees with it it depends on how
[39:34] you frame it right so if you have a a
[39:37] terrorist group for example right well
[39:39] the state disagrees with that terrorist
[39:41] group right so and I think most people
[39:43] would disagree with the terrorist group
[39:45] and uh but if you just have a protest
[39:47] right which from what I understand the
[39:48] truckers are up there protesting in
[39:50] Canada this is like couple years ago I
[39:52] think and and then you had the bankers
[39:54] you know just basically cut them off
[39:56] like you know you're not have access to
[39:57] your accounts to go up there and do the
[39:59] things that you want to do uh people
[40:02] moved Bitcoin to them so they they they
[40:06] got monetary value uh moved at the speed
[40:10] of light from
[40:12] donors uh or others who wanted to do
[40:15] business with them um whether through
[40:18] their own personal economic reasons or
[40:20] through some other uh political reason
[40:23] that they wanted to support their cause
[40:25] uh so I think that's happening
[40:27] that's already happened uh I think that
[40:31] uh the movement of Bitcoin so for
[40:33] example of in El Salvador from what I
[40:37] understand uh some of the nation state
[40:40] down there uh is buying and holding
[40:43] Bitcoin as part of their Sovereign
[40:45] Reserve right and so this idea that
[40:47] you're going to as a collective as a
[40:51] nation state Collective right that this
[40:54] that people are speaking with one voice
[40:57] through the nation state Collective
[40:59] right and buying and holding Bitcoin I
[41:02] think is is groundbreaking uh I don't
[41:05] think we've ever had that maybe with
[41:07] gold right but the difference and I've
[41:10] mentioned this in one of my Bitcoin and
[41:11] 30 minute videos as well is the
[41:13] difference with gold and Bitcoin is you
[41:14] can't move it unrestricted for point A
[41:17] to point B um throughout the world right
[41:21] and have it be have have very little to
[41:24] no intermediary that that takes you know
[41:27] two or five 10% off the top whether it's
[41:30] Visa a bank or whether it's you know
[41:32] Western Union or some other third party
[41:35] Fiat uh you know that moves money from
[41:38] you know different countries uh rather
[41:40] the movement of money is exclusively
[41:42] digital it's exclusively free it's
[41:45] exclusively open and I think that that
[41:48] that is that is catching on I think it
[41:50] will continue to catch
[41:52] on um so uh I think one of the the um
[41:58] one of the things that I'm quite
[41:59] surprised of is that that it hasn't
[42:02] caught on quicker I think um I think um
[42:06] back in 2018 2019 I was I was totally
[42:10] convinced that by
[42:12] 20203 2024 Apple would be accepting
[42:16] Bitcoin or Satoshi for their products
[42:19] right and that just has not happened so
[42:23] there is a little bit of a concern that
[42:24] I have about that um but I think
[42:27] I think the reason why that has not
[42:29] happened is partly because of what you
[42:32] mentioned previously which is the
[42:33] volatility of Bitcoin which is still
[42:36] very volatile uh it can go you know when
[42:39] folks ask me if they should buy Bitcoin
[42:41] like oneon-one like non-legal capacity
[42:43] nonfinancial advice the first thing I
[42:45] tell them is if you're not comfortable
[42:47] with the price going down 50% and just
[42:50] still holding it you shouldn't be buying
[42:52] it this is what I told them in 2018 2019
[42:56] 2020
[42:57] I I kept telling them you know because I
[42:59] people would ask me should I buy Bitcoin
[43:01] at 69,000 and I would just hey if you're
[43:04] not if you're not comfortable
[43:05] withholding it you know at 30,000 and
[43:07] 20,000 when it drops then maybe you
[43:10] should go buy a bond or something like
[43:12] that you know what I mean because the
[43:13] bond is it's not going to drop you know
[43:17] on its face value right it may drop in
[43:19] terms of its real value in the real
[43:21] economy but it's it's not its face value
[43:24] is going to stay the same it's going to
[43:25] make you feel better when you go to
[43:26] sleep at night so but for bitcoiners uh
[43:30] I think most bitcoiners including myself
[43:33] you know I always buy with the intention
[43:36] that this thing could drop by 50% or 30%
[43:39] tomorrow and there's not a damn thing I
[43:41] can do about it I mean I suppose I can
[43:43] take my Hardware wallet go to coinbase
[43:45] or go to Kraken or some other you know
[43:48] third party uh exchange and sell it
[43:50] really quick right uh but no I'm not
[43:52] going to do that because these Bitcoins
[43:54] I have a plan for them but I guess to
[43:57] answer your question very succinctly I
[43:58] think it's
[44:00] happening I think it's going to continue
[44:01] to happen uh I think in terms of moving
[44:05] Bitcoin from point A to point B and
[44:07] holding Bitcoin for its economic
[44:10] properties and its objective sound money
[44:13] principles as well as its monetary
[44:15] policy that is unmanipulated is that a
[44:18] word that cannot be manipulated is is
[44:22] growing so I think it was M Mich
[44:25] Michigan or Wisconsin their retirement
[44:27] fund is holding it I think the Japanese
[44:29] even are starting to hold it uh I think
[44:32] there's been some Cal or some Texas
[44:35] firefighters uh uh Pension funds that
[44:38] are holding it so the word is you know
[44:41] those um entities whether they be people
[44:44] companies Pension funds nation states
[44:48] nonprofits uh whether they be endowment
[44:50] funds whether they be you know s uh
[44:53] family funds I I think those entities
[44:56] that are looking for those sound money
[44:58] principles that are superior to gold and
[45:01] and also Superior to real estate in a
[45:03] lot of ways and they have the extra cash
[45:06] and they're okay with seeing it drop by
[45:08] 50% and just holding it those people are
[45:11] coming into Bitcoin because they're
[45:13] they're looking for the return they're
[45:14] looking for the duration and they're
[45:16] looking for in my opinion this is all my
[45:20] opinion not Financial advice not legal
[45:21] advice uh just I think they're looking
[45:24] for the continuity that Bitcoin has for
[45:28] the future right that they're looking
[45:30] towards the future right if if the
[45:32] economic Fiat base collapses and there's
[45:34] just let's just print another 30
[45:36] trillion right what's what's another 30
[45:39] trillion between friends right then
[45:41] they're like okay that's going to just
[45:44] explode
[45:45] inflation and that doesn't even get into
[45:50] we're just going to give money away you
[45:51] know I haven't even touched on the
[45:53] principle of Ubi uh Universal basic
[45:56] income this idea that potentially AI
[46:00] could get in Elon mus has talked about
[46:01] this and I agree with him that um AI
[46:05] could get so powerful and so useful that
[46:10] and productive that it could literally
[46:13] cause a mass unemployment crisis right
[46:16] so what does the state do when there's
[46:19] an when there's a crisis print print
[46:22] baby print right and tax um tax to fund
[46:26] the the printing um so I think that we
[46:29] could very well see a scenario in the
[46:31] future where Ubi is is a thing right we
[46:35] have millions of people on uh welfare
[46:38] today uh or what they call um uh snap uh
[46:42] I think it's substance nutritional
[46:44] something program it's basically like
[46:46] food food credit where you can get like
[46:48] you know food for families who can't
[46:50] make ends meet but I think we're going
[46:53] to see more of that I think we're going
[46:55] to see more handouts more giveaway ways
[46:57] and more printing uh and so the only way
[47:01] I think
[47:02] to uh have your
[47:05] money match up with a objective sound
[47:09] monetary policy is through merging your
[47:12] money and your economic power with
[47:14] Bitcoin because that 21 million cap and
[47:18] the blockchain doesn't lie it just is
[47:21] what it is it's like railroad tracks you
[47:23] know it it just is what it is you know
[47:26] it was vented we're here it's useful you
[47:30] can build a steam rail on it you can
[47:31] build a locomotive on it you can
[47:33] transport things on it and to the Future
[47:36] right um You can build a high-speed rail
[47:39] on it I think eventually we will have
[47:41] highp speed rails I think we'll have
[47:43] fourth generation blockchains that that
[47:45] speak to the Bitcoin Network um so I
[47:49] think the possibilities are still very
[47:50] very open and I I still and I think
[47:53] we're still very very early in this
[47:55] thing I do I I do do agree 100% it's
[47:59] it's funny how the
[48:01] perspective are different because I'm
[48:04] actually surprised by how far we are
[48:06] already with the medium of exchange side
[48:08] of things because I I was like okay we
[48:10] are now in the store of value adoption
[48:12] phase and I'm completely surprised that
[48:15] there's like in Nigeria and El Salvador
[48:17] even like I uh spend Bitcoin now on a
[48:20] monthly basis uh on on like a Meetup or
[48:24] like for for example as Salvador opting
[48:27] Bitcoin conference that is when this
[48:29] podcast will come out already over
[48:31] probably um will I will I spend their
[48:35] Bitcoin for the tickets and stuff like
[48:37] that so it's I'm kind of surprised that
[48:41] we already have so much circular economy
[48:43] so much um medum of exchange because
[48:46] right now Bitcoin the best thing you can
[48:48] do is buy and hle and and and don't like
[48:52] that's the use case for me personally
[48:55] right now and not the like oh I want to
[48:57] spend it and and stuff like that so that
[48:59] that's that's uh does not make sense for
[49:01] me right now because the tax
[49:04] implications stuff like that for in
[49:05] there but on that topic um what do you
[49:09] think are the the biggest um hurdles or
[49:12] the biggest challenges that that will
[49:14] come our way for for Bitcoin adoption in
[49:17] in the future well I think I think uh
[49:19] for individuals so I'll start with
[49:22] individuals because I think the the
[49:24] hurdles depend on who you are so if
[49:27] you're a company or if you're a hedge
[49:29] fund or if you have if you're acting in
[49:31] the market you know uh you know you need
[49:34] to have it you know certified and
[49:37] authenticated and you know have it be
[49:40] you know part of the special Club of you
[49:42] know assets that you're allowed to buy I
[49:44] guess but when it comes to individuals
[49:47] so going back to individuals I think the
[49:50] biggest in my personal opinion the
[49:52] biggest problem is the tax the this idea
[49:57] that when I spend Bitcoin um I'm doing
[50:02] so with a capital gain or excuse me a
[50:06] taxable event right so if I go buy
[50:09] $2,000 Us doll um LED flat screen right
[50:13] which is what I'm in the market for
[50:15] right
[50:16] now um that is a taxable event I have to
[50:20] calculate the basis of where I bought
[50:22] Bitcoin way back in
[50:25] 2018 right when I bought it like 3500
[50:27] bucks or whatever and then spend the
[50:30] taxable excuse me the capital gains tax
[50:33] which is like I don't know it's like I
[50:35] think
[50:36] it's I I don't even know what it is what
[50:38] is it like 21% or something like that um
[50:42] it depends I think like it's it's also
[50:44] like there in I think in America there's
[50:46] like a difference between longterm and
[50:48] and shortterm I think shortterm is like
[50:50] maybe 10% but I have no clue because I'm
[50:52] not in America in in Austria it's 27
[50:55] unfortunately but yeah but definitely
[50:59] taxes yeah so this would be a this would
[51:02] be a long-term capital gains and gains
[51:05] from sell of assets longterm is 0 to 20%
[51:08] depending on your taxable income so I
[51:10] mean that that's quite a bit of tax and
[51:14] that I mean obviously if you're talking
[51:16] about a 300X technology where I already
[51:19] you've gained 300 you know percent out
[51:22] of the technology then you reduce 20% so
[51:24] now it's like 280%
[51:26] um you know it's not it's still not bad
[51:28] game but who wants to pay that right so
[51:32] I think the tax is is is a barrier it's
[51:35] a significant barrier I think um because
[51:39] you know it makes no difference whether
[51:40] you buy a $2,000 TV versus a $10 you
[51:45] know McDonald's meal it's it's
[51:47] calculated the same right there there's
[51:50] no there's no tax exemption for for
[51:54] these transactions which is hugely
[51:56] problem atic I think um I think it's
[51:58] problematic Prim you know primarily
[52:00] because it doesn't allow Bitcoin to move
[52:02] in the real economy the way I think it
[52:04] should um and it causes the the volume
[52:08] of Bitcoin transactions to go down
[52:10] substantially um but that said you know
[52:13] there was a time where the Bitcoin uh
[52:15] men poool or the blockchain before it
[52:17] gets to the blockchain was so crowded
[52:19] right and uh there was just too many
[52:21] transactions that the memory pool
[52:23] couldn't keep up with and so uh the
[52:25] transaction fees were like you know $15
[52:28] for a transaction or whatever it was
[52:29] like crazy this is like 2018
[52:32] 2019 um and so I think there's a problem
[52:34] there too but that's much more of a
[52:36] technology problem than it is a tax
[52:38] problem so I think that taxes is partly
[52:41] the problem um I think the um let's see
[52:46] in terms of adoption uh I think
[52:48] education is an issue as well um and I
[52:52] think education is really interesting
[52:54] because you can get at education at any
[52:56] level basically um so last year I went
[52:59] to a Lego festival in Virginia and um
[53:03] there was there was a little spot where
[53:05] you can put Legos up and make like a
[53:07] little like U Mosaic of some sort but
[53:09] with Legos right and so my Mosaic of
[53:12] course was a Bitcoin symbol right so I I
[53:14] made this big Bitcoin symbol and this
[53:17] little boy comes up next to me and he
[53:19] was like he had to be like nine years
[53:20] old or eight years old he was a little
[53:22] kid like probably Elementary or middle
[53:25] school and he comes up to he goes oh
[53:27] look Bitcoin and I was like what I
[53:30] looked at him and I was like you know
[53:32] what Bitcoin is and he's like yeah
[53:34] that's a Bitcoin that's a Bitcoin and
[53:36] and I'm like well what is bitcoin he's
[53:38] like it's like digital money and I'm
[53:40] like holy shoot we you know we have
[53:43] reached altitude with this technology in
[53:46] terms of at least if not know knowing
[53:50] the understanding the the monetary
[53:52] policy and why it's important for
[53:54] Humanity but at least knowing what the
[53:56] symbol is Right The Branding and the
[53:58] symbolism I think is so important
[54:00] because it at least gets the
[54:01] conversation started right so another
[54:05] example of of how Bitcoin is continues
[54:07] to proliferate is there was a um there
[54:11] was a Halloween uh ring camera that
[54:15] captured some some kids here in America
[54:18] going up to the uh to the uh little
[54:20] candy bucket and there were these little
[54:23] Bitcoin uh cards right and they're like
[54:25] oh Bitcoin Bitcoin like you know you got
[54:28] to get one you got to get one or you got
[54:29] to get some you know and so the the idea
[54:32] in terms of its value or its
[54:34] desirability I think is is definitely
[54:37] there and there were some kids in the
[54:38] background they're like what's a bitcoin
[54:40] what's a bitcoin you know like so I
[54:42] think there there's an understanding at
[54:44] a very young level that and from what I
[54:47] understand also that they're learning
[54:49] about you know my my middle school
[54:51] nephew told me like last month that
[54:53] they're learning about Bitcoin and
[54:54] economics and in Middle School right and
[54:56] so I think the notion of digital money
[55:00] that that starts from birth right it is
[55:03] never nation state money it's totally
[55:05] agnostic right it's literally pure
[55:08] digital money and an objective you know
[55:10] railroad track whatever you want to call
[55:12] it blockchain right that invention is so
[55:16] important that it's being taught in
[55:18] schools so I think the the education is
[55:22] certainly there and the continuity as
[55:24] far as the understanding and the a
[55:26] knowledge that we need this thing uh to
[55:29] to at very least balance out you know
[55:33] what we the society that we live in
[55:35] today I think I think Bitcoin is serves
[55:37] as a balancing mechanism but anyway so
[55:40] we got the taxation we've got the um the
[55:44] education uh let's see what else I think
[55:47] I think I wrote These down event
[55:49] somewhere but I can't find them let's
[55:51] see
[55:53] volatility uh I don't think so I think
[55:56] those two I think those two is what I
[55:57] got for that as far as adoption those
[55:59] are the big hurdles that I can think of
[56:01] right now because pension FS are Pension
[56:04] funds are already in it you know nation
[56:06] states are starting to buy it right so
[56:08] we are we are on a path of adoption I
[56:11] think the floodgates are open uh they're
[56:14] still closed in some respects uh but but
[56:17] but they are open uh in 2018 we talked
[56:20] about the ETF floodgates were you know
[56:23] they were just starting to crack open
[56:25] you know but we didn't have a US ETF I
[56:27] think Australia had an ETF Canada had an
[56:29] ETF you know but uh the United States
[56:32] the Capital Market you know the largest
[56:34] one didn't have an ETF and then we had
[56:37] some some some bans going on with the
[56:39] China ban and it was like you know okay
[56:42] you know this is not good for adoption
[56:44] but then it failed and then China got
[56:46] back on board with the Bitcoins I'm like
[56:48] okay that's good for adoption right
[56:51] so there are some barriers still and I
[56:53] think there some of them are legal
[56:55] barriers when it comes to a Taxation and
[56:58] some of them are education barriers when
[56:59] it comes to
[57:01] learning uh why Bitcoin is important a
[57:05] and
[57:07] why why
[57:09] it why it continues to be number go up
[57:13] technology I like I said I can't
[57:15] guarantee the number go up but I think
[57:17] it is number go up technology will it
[57:19] always be that way I don't know I mean I
[57:22] I think if if countries are able to to
[57:26] engage in some sort of austerity uh you
[57:29] know buckling up the spending maybe some
[57:32] audits uh that would uh decrease or make
[57:36] more efficient the the the power of each
[57:41] dollar or the power of each unit of
[57:43] currency of political currency I think
[57:46] that would be helpful uh to kind of
[57:49] temper down the the the Bitcoin growth
[57:53] so the two are kind of you know as money
[57:56] just gets out of control the Bitcoin
[57:58] grow also just gets out of control too
[58:00] so it's very much a barometer in that
[58:02] way um but you know and we saw that with
[58:05] the central banks and when the central
[58:07] banks you know increased the interest
[58:09] rates um I think they they got up to
[58:12] like what 7% 8% something like that uh
[58:15] that that decreased I think I think in
[58:19] my opinion that that that operated to
[58:21] decrease the the fast increase of price
[58:24] for Bitcoin um but when the when the
[58:29] Central Bank uh decreased the um the
[58:32] percentage rates I think it was like
[58:34] half a percent that caused the Bitcoin
[58:36] price again to just go back up you know
[58:39] so it's there's definitely some
[58:41] responding that's going on there there's
[58:42] some symbiosis I think that is going on
[58:45] there uh the relationship between the
[58:47] interest rates and Bitcoin I think if
[58:49] interest rates came down all the way to
[58:51] 2% and and cheapen the value of the
[58:53] currency Bitcoin would be way above 100
[58:55] $100 right now I
[58:58] do it's interesting uh when we look at
[59:02] the perspective of Bitcoin is a number
[59:04] gr technology uh for me I think last
[59:08] year I discovered that that's site that
[59:11] I shared our priced in in Bitcoin 21.com
[59:14] um I have still no clue where who who
[59:16] even made that site I think it's it's an
[59:19] amazing one um but uh it's it's like
[59:22] when you look at everything in the world
[59:24] and then you price it in Bitcoin then
[59:27] you actually get to know like what
[59:28] Bitcoin actually is like Bitcoin for me
[59:30] is like not like of course it's not M
[59:32] technology because right now the unit of
[59:34] account is US dollars or your local fear
[59:36] currency also for me I think in Euros
[59:40] obviously but if you make that Minds
[59:43] shift already now and think in Bitcoin
[59:46] it's really powerful and right now it's
[59:49] uh massive to see like everything is red
[59:52] in terms of Bitcoin because Bitcoin is
[59:54] reaching up uh so high but even like an
[59:57] an S&P 500 when you see the the the
[60:00] equity markets it's like there's like
[60:03] one green thing in here energy if you
[60:05] look at the freear chart it's like it's
[60:08] it's everything is red in in Bitcoin
[60:10] terms oh there's another green one uh
[60:13] but also just in like the month uh
[60:15] column so I think that's that that shows
[60:18] the the power that Bitcoin had over the
[60:21] last couple of weeks months years and
[60:25] soon decades because we are already one
[60:27] and a half decades in in into this
[60:29] Bitcoin thing and I do think as long as
[60:32] Bitcoin uh works in the future also as
[60:35] sound money and and all other assets are
[60:38] getting debased all the time that this
[60:40] pattern will just continue to happen uh
[60:44] but the Mind shift is really important
[60:47] yeah oh yeah for sure and I think partly
[60:50] why we see that is because Bitcoin is
[60:53] still very new uh it's still relatively
[60:56] a new asset on the world stage I
[60:58] remember in 2018 2019
[61:02] where um some of my friends uh and some
[61:05] family members too would say hey
[61:07] bitcoin's a bubble this thing's a bubble
[61:09] it's going to pop
[61:10] right and you know really kind of got me
[61:13] thinking you know because I grew up in
[61:15] you know I was I was mentored by my
[61:17] uncle who owned some he did Real Estate
[61:20] development um and you know for lowcost
[61:23] housing so he would always watch the
[61:25] bond prices right at 2% or 3% or
[61:29] whatever and he was around when 2008
[61:31] came down and you know all the banks
[61:33] were bailed out and you know his his
[61:36] company was really hurting at that time
[61:38] but uh I bring that up because he would
[61:42] always talk about like really big
[61:44] numbers you know like 14 million you
[61:46] know and you know there's so much
[61:48] trillions here and trillions there and
[61:50] and you know it was hard to keep up with
[61:53] these these big numbers and I get I
[61:55] mentioned that because in 2018 2019 I
[61:58] did not think that Bitcoin was a bubble
[62:00] at all I thought it was a retail bubble
[62:03] right like retail which you know if you
[62:06] if you consider how much cash retail has
[62:10] in their accounts right middle class
[62:12] lower middle class upper class Americans
[62:14] maybe even a little bit of the 1%
[62:16] sprinkled in I mean it can't be more
[62:18] than you know I don't know like a
[62:20] trillion maybe right but that that's in
[62:22] comparison to how much cash and how much
[62:26] debt exists right so every Bond that's
[62:28] out there uh from the way I understand
[62:31] bonds you can convert them into cash at
[62:34] some point there's a maturity date and
[62:35] then you get paid right so plus the
[62:38] interest so at least that's how I think
[62:41] it works I mean again I'm not a
[62:42] financial guy but um I mentioned that
[62:46] because the the whole idea of a bubble
[62:50] right when it came to bitcoin was not
[62:53] there it just was not
[62:56] my thought was okay this thing's
[62:57] approaching 900 trillion it's still baby
[63:00] like it it's so young it's so tiny so
[63:03] what we're seeing I think today is that
[63:05] Bitcoin is starting to and I think uh
[63:08] some other commentators have already
[63:09] commented on this it's starting to price
[63:11] people out like you know middle class
[63:14] Americans are being priced out the
[63:15] millionaire class is going to be priced
[63:17] out the billionaire class is eventually
[63:19] going to be priced out and then the
[63:21] entities with with trillions of of cash
[63:24] right they'll also be priced out and at
[63:26] that point Bitcoin will be our you know
[63:28] monetary system I guess um I mentioned
[63:31] that because you know the chart that you
[63:32] pulled up with respect to having
[63:34] everything uh up not everything but like
[63:38] most of the larger assets and and and
[63:40] markets the S&P the NASDAQ and gold and
[63:43] oil and things like that the numbers are
[63:46] in the red as compared to bitcoin and I
[63:48] think the reason why they're red in
[63:50] comparison to bitcoin is because
[63:52] bitcoin's still very much growing it's
[63:55] still got a Long Way to Grow uh you know
[63:58] I did this exercise recently and it's
[64:02] it's thinking about okay if I can go to
[64:04] coinbase right if I can go to coinbase
[64:06] and
[64:08] buy let's see
[64:10] $100,000 worth of bitcoin right so that
[64:14] gives me to at today's market price I
[64:17] did some math that gives me about 1
[64:22] point I think it's like 1.4 Bitcoins or
[64:25] something like that right with
[64:27] $100,000 the point of the exercise is to
[64:30] compare the
[64:31] two uh the two ecosystems you have the
[64:35] US dollar ecosystem which has
[64:38] 37.3 something trillion in cash uh
[64:43] liquidity and bonds right and then if
[64:46] you have
[64:47] $100,000 of
[64:50] 37 whatever $35 trillion right that's
[64:54] like.
[64:57] 00% of the entire ecosystem your share
[65:00] of that entire cash dominated ecosystem
[65:04] or Fiat dominated ecosystem is super
[65:07] super super super super super tiny right
[65:09] it's it's like really tiny right in
[65:12] other words you're not rich like you're
[65:14] you're you have
[65:15] $100,000 I mean yeah you can buy some
[65:18] stuff it's great but in comparison to
[65:21] the hole it's still you're like a little
[65:24] spec basically now take that and compare
[65:28] it to the Bitcoin ecosystem right you
[65:30] have the $100,000 you convert it to one
[65:33] point uh for Bitcoins right so you still
[65:37] have a very small percentage of the 21
[65:39] million Bitcoins but your slice of the
[65:42] pie is much larger it's like 18 times
[65:45] larger 18 or 19 times larger of the
[65:48] entire P the idea is that would you
[65:51] rather live in a future where your slice
[65:54] of the pie is is like a little spec
[65:58] versus your slice of the pie is actually
[66:02] you know a nice little meal does that
[66:04] make sense so the the the idea of the
[66:07] exercise is to try to understand that
[66:10] Bitcoin is not it's not necessarily
[66:13] competing with the dollar right I know
[66:16] it seems like that right now but I think
[66:18] Bitcoin is its own
[66:21] ecosystem that eventually I think will
[66:24] play together with the US dollar like
[66:26] you'll go to the store and this is just
[66:29] my speculation again you'll go to the
[66:31] store and I think in some countries it's
[66:32] already happening as you mentioned and
[66:34] you will be able to buy things in
[66:36] Bitcoin without being taxed to death for
[66:39] doing so uh that doesn't mean that the
[66:41] Fiat will go away because I think I
[66:43] think it won't go away I think it will
[66:44] still be its own thing right but it will
[66:48] mean that the the value of the cash
[66:52] right will be much more debased in that
[66:54] future then and you will have much less
[66:57] of the pie and again that's $100,000
[66:59] right that's that's for a lot of people
[67:02] that's that's a whole year of of work
[67:05] right but if you buy if you just hold
[67:10] the cash right and this is partly what
[67:12] microor is doing you know you're losing
[67:15] you're losing you're losing losing
[67:17] you're getting less of the pie less and
[67:18] less less of the pie every day if you
[67:21] convert the cash instantaneously to
[67:22] bitcoin you get a much bigger piece of
[67:24] the pie right
[67:26] and you're not being debased every
[67:27] single day so the two ecosystems are
[67:31] very different I think it makes common
[67:33] sense like which one you want right you
[67:35] want the bigger piece of the pie um and
[67:38] plus it's just more exciting so that
[67:40] that's that's an amazing uh perspective
[67:43] and I think it also shines a light on
[67:44] like the two differences like um like
[67:48] when we look at why Bitcoin is growing
[67:51] your purchasing power there are really
[67:53] two reasons for that and I'm not talking
[67:55] about growing the US dollar price I'm
[67:57] actually talking about growing your
[67:59] purchasing power if like Bitcoin goes up
[68:01] in a year 2% you probably lost
[68:04] purchasing power uh in that year because
[68:07] your PRI prices what you have to pay for
[68:10] keeping your yourself alive is is higher
[68:13] is rising more than 2% most likely uh so
[68:16] like there's two reasons why the
[68:18] purchasing power of Bitcoin is going up
[68:20] the first reason is like we get more
[68:22] efficient like uh we we we make things
[68:26] cheaper we we make things more efficient
[68:28] in a way uh and and the second reason
[68:31] why Bitcoin purchasing power is growing
[68:34] is more people coming into
[68:38] Bitcoin and that's the main reason right
[68:42] now why we have those crazy crazy um
[68:46] bull runs and bare runs and and all
[68:49] those Cycles where we see 40% down and
[68:51] 300% up and and those things because we
[68:55] have have an asset that's which is
[68:57] really compelling and a lot of people
[69:00] flow into this asset and when a lot of
[69:02] people come in that asset obviously
[69:04] volatility is a result of that once uh
[69:08] Bitcoin reaches reaches a maturity and
[69:11] then there's a whole another debate what
[69:12] what does that mean what does it mean
[69:14] Bitcoin maturity but let's just leave it
[69:16] at that right now then we don't have a
[69:19] lot more people coming in maybe we have
[69:22] more people come in if we find other
[69:24] planets we other people on there or
[69:26] something like that uh but that's a
[69:27] whole another discussion but we we have
[69:29] a closed system then and then the only
[69:33] way Bitcoin purchasing power is growing
[69:36] is if we get more efficient so Bitcoin
[69:38] purchasing power maybe is going up 1% or
[69:42] 5% in a year and it's not a lot uh and
[69:45] and this is like the uh the way I like
[69:48] to think about it and then when you also
[69:51] then put on the US dollar price
[69:52] obviously it it goes up way quicker than
[69:55] that because the US dollar is losing
[69:58] purchasing power so I think what you
[69:59] just described is an amazing also a mind
[70:02] shift that you have to do and like why
[70:04] is Bitcoin actually growing in
[70:07] purchasing power what are the reasons
[70:08] behind that I love that a lot yeah yeah
[70:11] I mean there there are promises that
[70:13] have to be made right so when we're
[70:16] talking about nation states just
[70:18] generally right even even companies
[70:21] right when you issue a bond you're
[70:23] issuing a promise a promise to pay back
[70:26] so there are
[70:28] 35 whatever trillion promises that have
[70:31] to be
[70:32] made and they're going to be made I
[70:34] think they're going to be made because
[70:36] yeah they should be made right and the I
[70:40] don't think we necessar you know and
[70:42] this is coming from you know their own
[70:43] statements I I don't think the central
[70:45] bank has to necessarily you know conquer
[70:49] or steal or whatever they just print or
[70:52] you know they issue more bonds at a
[70:54] higher or lower
[70:55] higher or lower interest rates and they
[70:57] you know pay the interest on the
[70:59] existing debt so but I guess what
[71:01] I'm that system I think either will
[71:05] stop continue or continue less fast so I
[71:10] think I think what's going to happen
[71:12] with the Legacy system is is still very
[71:14] much uncertain I think um but I think in
[71:18] the short term it will continue to grow
[71:20] it will continue to expand um it's it
[71:23] always perplexes me when I see you know
[71:25] on on social media or online you know
[71:27] folks in South America using US dollar
[71:30] currency right
[71:32] so the the economic value of the US
[71:35] dollar is is is is is acceptable down
[71:39] there right as a means of exchange as a
[71:42] unit of account um but it's not that
[71:45] nation's currency I think I think that's
[71:46] kind of interesting mostly because you
[71:48] know the question I think is are they
[71:49] paying taxes to the US government right
[71:52] so the taxpayers of the US government
[71:54] obviously we pay the tax taxes uh and
[71:56] then you know that that supports the the
[71:58] payments on interest from what I
[72:00] understand but you know as far as the
[72:02] infinite issuance of debt and the
[72:05] infinite issuance of cash you know it
[72:07] begs a question like why are we paying
[72:08] taxes if the if if the cash can just be
[72:11] infinitely issued you know and the debt
[72:14] is infinite as well right just
[72:16] mathematically put it in a black box and
[72:18] let it do its thing you know put the
[72:20] cash and the debt or excuse me put the
[72:22] debt into a black box stop tracking it
[72:26] just issue it right just issue it and
[72:29] quit keep keeping track of it and qu
[72:30] quit fear mongering everybody that 35
[72:33] trillion is is a be big deal because
[72:36] it's it's it's not it's it's infinite
[72:38] right so I guess I say that tongue and
[72:40] cheek and kind of sarcastically but the
[72:42] point I'm trying to make
[72:43] is I don't think I don't think with the
[72:47] with the straight face and a confident
[72:49] face that somebody can say that that
[72:51] that that this is infinite right because
[72:53] these things that are man-made these
[72:55] manmade constructs right they have
[72:57] barriers I think I think one way to to
[73:00] to to justify the additional issuance of
[73:05] of currency like us US dollar currency
[73:08] would be to digitize it right to make it
[73:11] digital
[73:13] to operate it in such a way where it is
[73:17] attached to other components and
[73:19] elements and information in the digital
[73:22] domain uh and I think I think we will
[73:24] see that in in our lifetimes I think
[73:26] we'll see much more fluid uh
[73:30] monetization of information on the
[73:33] internet and social media uh with you
[73:36] know internet of things with you know uh
[73:39] electronic vehicles with AI I mean when
[73:43] we get to that point I think then you
[73:46] have a better justification to say the
[73:48] issuance of the debt is infinite it's
[73:50] not attached to you know nation state
[73:53] land it's not attached to military U
[73:57] artillery or you know equipment it's not
[73:59] attached to productivity of oil or
[74:02] resources it's attached not only to all
[74:05] those things but it's also attached to
[74:07] the digital domain as well so I I I say
[74:11] all that to say that you know this idea
[74:13] that that that that the fiat currency is
[74:15] just going to magically go away I I
[74:17] think I don't in my opinion I don't
[74:18] think it's going to happen I think it'll
[74:20] be digitized um I don't think it's
[74:22] necessarily going to be a cbdc although
[74:24] we probably will have cbdc cbdc as an
[74:27] option um but that doesn't also mean
[74:30] that Bitcoin will go away Bitcoin is the
[74:34] exemplification it is the manifestation
[74:37] of sound money principles which is the
[74:39] 21 million cap with it which is the
[74:41] proof of work and the audit that it does
[74:44] on its own self every 10 minutes th this
[74:47] kind of objective transparent sound
[74:49] money principle there is a place in the
[74:51] world uh for that in the there's a place
[74:53] in the future for that in this world uh
[74:57] and I think your generation and
[74:59] succeeding Generations will continue to
[75:01] believe that um because it's a great
[75:03] it's a great insurance policy too yeah
[75:07] absolutely that's a great Point yeah um
[75:11] perfect then uh let's come uh to the
[75:14] question that everyone of my guests uh
[75:17] are is is getting and the question is
[75:19] what can we learn from you besides
[75:21] Bitcoin oh man I you mean like Hobbies
[75:25] whatever you want to go like uh like
[75:27] that you can go to a specific skill uh
[75:30] something you learned uh some hobby like
[75:33] I I leave it open to you what you want
[75:35] to share it just the Only Rule is it has
[75:37] nothing to do with
[75:38] Bitcoin oh yeah well I I am a hypers
[75:42] scooter rider so I I like to ride hypers
[75:46] scooters um so what is a hypers scooter
[75:50] uh a hypers scooter is the scooter that
[75:52] you stand on uh it goes about $35 miles
[75:55] an hour or up to 45 miles an hour uh you
[75:58] got to wear a helmet uh well you should
[76:01] wear a helmet uh you know it's it's it's
[76:04] similar in structure as as the scooters
[76:06] you see all over the place you know
[76:08] they're like um yeah there you go yeah
[76:11] they're like uh they have different
[76:12] brands like Apollo and wolf and uh
[76:16] they're just really fun you know I I uh
[76:19] I suppose it's like an e scooter it's
[76:21] like a hyper electronic scooter yeah
[76:24] they're really really fun uh if you if
[76:27] you don't know what you're doing you
[76:28] could totally kill yourself on one
[76:29] they're probably more dangerous than
[76:31] motorcycles uh but I find them
[76:34] fascinating uh
[76:36] because it's a great example of you know
[76:40] that that technology that we that that
[76:43] thesis or that that principle of
[76:45] Technology this idea that you know you
[76:48] can have something like a lithium ion
[76:51] battery you know that has Innovation
[76:53] built in and the battery management
[76:56] system and you can you know literally
[76:59] cancel out some of the existing modes of
[77:03] transportation um so you know we have
[77:05] some people taking hypers Scooters or
[77:07] scooters to work now in some of the
[77:09] cities where it's safe um you know
[77:13] they're they're good for like little
[77:14] short trips like to the grocery store or
[77:16] something like that uh you definitely
[77:18] have to like it's a skill right so it's
[77:21] it's it's not like riding a bike at all
[77:23] really uh you can't really let go of the
[77:26] handlebars at
[77:27] all um but I have about 2,000 miles on
[77:30] on my hypers scooter I love that a lot
[77:32] it's it's I think my my dad has also one
[77:36] at home uh and it's it's really fun to
[77:39] drive them I just like call them
[77:41] scooters I I didn't knew what a hypers
[77:42] scooter is but yeah it's it's it's a
[77:44] it's a really good one they can
[77:48] call yeah they are called hypers SC with
[77:51] Google you can find it like that so it's
[77:54] really really cool uh I but I agree they
[77:57] are really really dangerous I I drove
[77:59] with one it's like wow like you can hurt
[78:01] yourself really quickly like faster than
[78:03] a bike faster than a motorcycle probably
[78:05] also like not faster driving but faster
[78:08] you you can hurt yourself you can hurt
[78:10] somebody
[78:11] else yeah absolutely you Canard someone
[78:14] else to but yeah it's the I love
[78:17] everything that has wheels and a motor
[78:20] like like put something with wheels and
[78:23] Motors together and I will love it I was
[78:25] coming up up on a farm uh and there we
[78:28] have tractors and all those those things
[78:30] and I I loved it I loved it a lot like
[78:33] just driving around and doing things on
[78:35] on on the farm uh that that's kind of uh
[78:38] maybe I will go my my Bitcoin retirement
[78:42] on a farm and just drive around with
[78:44] with different Vehicles not doing
[78:46] anything productive just like messing
[78:48] around on a farm oh yeah for sure there
[78:50] they're just loads of fun I mean I mean
[78:53] you do got to watch out for the uh the
[78:55] people though you know you got to you
[78:56] got to be courtesy be courteous be
[78:59] civilized think about other people
[79:01] before you think about yourself you know
[79:03] I think that that's a good way to live
[79:05] but yeah you know the hypers scooter the
[79:07] scooters the E Scooters rather um I got
[79:10] my first one like I think it was like
[79:12] three or four years ago I was like man
[79:14] I'm going to kill myself on this thing
[79:15] because I'm not a motorcycle
[79:17] guy so I was a little scared uh but you
[79:21] know I had the helmet and everything and
[79:23] I had pads and everything and my buddy
[79:25] was like dude it's not that serious and
[79:27] I'm like yes it is it's that
[79:30] serious but I I I I Fallen a couple
[79:33] times but I'm still here so apparently
[79:36] you know I guess God wants you to be
[79:38] here to talk about Bitcoin I don't know
[79:40] who knows you know what I mean
[79:43] absolutely yeah really cool um we have
[79:46] an end in the podcast where the previous
[79:48] guest is asking question for the next
[79:49] guest without knowing who the next guest
[79:51] uh actually is and your question is an
[79:53] interesting one uh how can
[79:55] ensure that the ideology you have as a
[79:58] bitcoiner today would be understood by
[80:01] your ancestors 200 years from now yeah
[80:05] so this kind of goes into uh my work as
[80:08] a as a well my role as an attorney so
[80:12] I've been sending emails out to
[80:14] different uh law firms uh here in the
[80:16] United States i' I've gotten some
[80:19] responses back but the long story short
[80:21] is I want to put the Bitcoin into a
[80:24] living
[80:25] trust um a legal trust so it's called a
[80:30] um I think it's called a residual
[80:31] charitable trust so the idea is that I
[80:35] would move my current bitcoin into the
[80:38] residual excuse me residual charitable
[80:41] trust okay there would be a trustee
[80:45] probably like one of the third parties
[80:47] out here that are that are
[80:49] creditable and they would over time use
[80:53] the Bitcoin for the benefit of
[80:55] beneficiaries myself my mom some of my
[80:59] nephews but the idea there is that if
[81:02] anything were to happen to me and I were
[81:04] to Die For example that trust will still
[81:07] be
[81:08] alive right and the beneficiaries mom
[81:12] nephews and things like that aunts they
[81:15] could still benefit from the V Bitcoin
[81:18] from the trust so this idea is that I'm
[81:21] passing along the property and the
[81:23] principles and the idea ology to kind of
[81:25] go and answer your question I would do
[81:29] first I talk about Bitcoin all the time
[81:30] to my family they're so done they're
[81:32] they're like they're done and my friends
[81:35] they're done so I'm just like look if
[81:37] you want to stay poor that's fine as for
[81:40] me you know we're going to the Moon baby
[81:43] so but legally one way I want to do that
[81:46] is put the Bitcoin into a charitable
[81:47] residual trust when the Bitcoin is all
[81:50] run out then by law the trust has to
[81:53] give a certain portion
[81:55] of the property to a
[81:57] charity yeah so that's kind of how I
[82:01] want
[82:02] to move the Bitcoin into the future
[82:05] Beyond when I when I'm already dead
