[00:00] the next 12 to 18 months could be very
[00:02] interesting it's very realistic that you
[00:03] might see an 8 to 10 year Bull Run
[00:06] similar to what you saw when the gold
[00:08] ETF was launched Michael sailor saying
[00:10] on the record that his vision and his
[00:12] goal is to make micro strategy a
[00:14] trillion dollar company on some profit
[00:16] level you know micro strategy has now
[00:18] outperformed Microsoft what are your
[00:20] thoughts on Microsoft actually maybe
[00:22] going ahead and and buying Bitcoin my
[00:24] gut feeling is that the vote's going to
[00:26] be close but that it's going to be
[00:28] approved and they're going to do it
[00:29] we're in totally Uncharted territories
[00:31] as far as institutional nation state
[00:33] adoption micro strategy in particular is
[00:35] going to be one of if not the biggest
[00:38] stories in corporate finance ever if you
[00:40] can just print as much money as you want
[00:42] why are you taxing us why am I being
[00:45] taxed if you can just print money at
[00:48] will like it blows my mind it makes no
[00:51] sense Bitcoin is good for the individual
[00:53] the family the company the country maybe
[00:57] you should buy some Bitcoin the more
[00:59] doors people can walk through to get to
[01:01] bitcoin the better if you don't own
[01:02] Bitcoin you will be poor the ECB
[01:04] literally came out and said that a week
[01:06] ago Bitcoin is going to go to whichever
[01:08] jurisdiction it's treated best money is
[01:10] a very powerful motivator and causes
[01:13] people to take certain action within the
[01:14] next 5 to 10 years we're going to be
[01:16] living in a world that we cannot imagine
[01:19] right now from a tax standpoint from a
[01:21] technology standpoint from a freedom
[01:23] standpoint I think it's going to be
[01:24] amazing micro strategy will be a Bitcoin
[01:27] bank and I think that all of the
[01:28] existing traditional Banks will be
[01:30] Bitcoin Banks I think you'll be able to
[01:31] walk into a branch in your hometown and
[01:34] you'll be able to buy
[01:35] [Music]
[01:39] Bitcoin by the way in my research I came
[01:43] to know that uh from where I first saw
[01:46] you it was on the best business show I
[01:48] was religiously looking at that show uh
[01:52] back in like 2020 I think 2020 and 2021
[01:55] they they had that show going uh and I I
[01:58] love that show in my orange building
[02:00] moments now I think they don't even do
[02:02] it anymore in that format but from there
[02:05] I I knew I was like I know this guy from
[02:07] some somewhere really cool um and you I
[02:11] also saw that you're in the same Studio
[02:12] as pomp is is that the same where you
[02:15] record your your podcast how is that
[02:17] relationship going yeah so he's been
[02:20] very gracious in um uh he had posted on
[02:24] Twitter about his investor Exchange
[02:26] program I wanted to bring a few people
[02:28] into the office so they could work on
[02:30] their own stuff but out of his office
[02:32] and um so I've been here for a few
[02:34] months now and uh now he's been very
[02:36] gracious with
[02:38] um giving me an office to work out of so
[02:40] I'm not working from home um I was in
[02:43] Freedom Tower uh for about a year in
[02:46] 2021 during covid um just to get out of
[02:49] the house and have someplace to go that
[02:51] wasn't a coffee shop um but I ended up
[02:54] not going there very often uh because it
[02:57] was I was on the upper west side at that
[02:59] point and it was maybe 30 minutes to get
[03:01] down there and so I I gave up that
[03:03] office space was just working from home
[03:06] and um Anthony was uh yeah invited me in
[03:09] kind of like a networking idea to uh get
[03:12] people together and instead of just um
[03:15] that this is my version of it not his
[03:17] but uh you know instead of just meeting
[03:19] someone for five minutes or 15 minutes
[03:22] at a networking event to kind of like
[03:23] you know work out the same office and
[03:25] get to you know have a few conversations
[03:27] so that led to me working out a deal to
[03:31] uh use the uh Studio that's here to
[03:34] record some episodes and so yeah it's
[03:38] been quite the uh wild Journey so far
[03:41] and yeah Anthony's been uh very helpful
[03:45] and gracious so very cool really really
[03:47] cool I L that a lot yeah he was very um
[03:51] he was very uh important for me for the
[03:53] orange pilling like the first like half
[03:55] year or something like that uh and you
[03:56] also talk a lot about micro strategy at
[03:58] least that's that's what comes to my my
[04:00] feed with with your guest and and micr
[04:02] strategy um why are you like why the
[04:06] focus on on micro strategy for you yeah
[04:10] so I was just telling someone in the
[04:12] office uh part of this story this
[04:14] morning and I haven't really shared it
[04:17] so my orange pill moment was in January
[04:20] of 2021 uh one of the uh gentleman that
[04:24] I work with um with the private Equity
[04:26] work that I do um got you know was
[04:29] allocating to bitcoin back in May of
[04:31] 2017 and he has a macroeconomic
[04:34] background and so he spent a lot of time
[04:36] with me um walking me through the macro
[04:40] the history of money um money printing
[04:43] just all of these Concepts that seem
[04:46] very obvious to me now but until you
[04:49] have someone kind of put their arm
[04:51] around you and say hey here's what's
[04:53] really going on and and walk alongside
[04:55] you um I guess it's not obvious and so I
[05:00] started allocating to Bitcoin in January
[05:02] of 2021 and uh just kept dollar cost
[05:05] averaging and smash buying Bitcoin
[05:08] whenever I could um and
[05:12] then uh earlier this year I was invited
[05:16] out to Las Vegas to attend the um I
[05:20] shouldn't say to attend I was invited
[05:22] out uh to hang out with some friends in
[05:24] Las Vegas they were attending the micro
[05:26] strategy 2024 World Conference and I
[05:30] should have gotten a ticket and walked
[05:31] through the door um I didn't I was just
[05:34] kind of in and out we had a lot of fun
[05:36] we rented a couple of fancy cars and
[05:38] drove around the Red Rock Canyon and you
[05:41] know outside the city and you know just
[05:43] kind of uh that was very very fun and
[05:46] just you know spent some quality time
[05:47] went out had dinner with everybody um
[05:50] and this is kind of embarrassing so
[05:52] we're we're driving these cars around
[05:54] we're getting out at Red Rock Canyon and
[05:56] kind of just like climbing up the Rocks
[05:58] a little bit taking some pictures I was
[06:00] paying so little attention to micro
[06:03] strategy as a company although I had
[06:05] watched every Michael sailor video that
[06:08] YouTube possesses in its library that uh
[06:12] on the flight out to Vegas I was on my
[06:14] phone and I'm like well I don't want to
[06:17] feel like I'm not part of this crew so I
[06:19] bought one share of micro strategy I'm
[06:21] like all right now I'm in right and
[06:24] we're standing there um in front of
[06:27] these rocks just chatting and said hey
[06:30] guys just so you know you know that I'm
[06:32] not a faker I I on the way on the flight
[06:35] here I bought one chair of micro
[06:37] strategy and they're like oh that's
[06:38] great and now looking back now I'm like
[06:40] that's pretty embarrassing actually but
[06:43] that was the beginning of my journey and
[06:45] it wasn't that long ago it was whenever
[06:47] that conference was in the spring so you
[06:50] know I am a for me owning something even
[06:54] if it's one share then I'm looking at it
[06:58] I'm seeing what it's doing
[07:00] um I'm paying attention to it so
[07:04] um a few months ago
[07:08] I was kind of looking at what the
[07:11] Bitcoin price action was doing which was
[07:14] nothing right it's going sideways summer
[07:18] 58,000 to 72,000 more or less um for a
[07:22] while right most of this year after kind
[07:24] of the excitement around the ETF launch
[07:27] in January and so I thought
[07:30] um you know I don't know I love Bitcoin
[07:34] I love all of the different aspects of
[07:37] it but I also like that the number goes
[07:39] up and so I just happened to be looking
[07:43] at one of the Bloomberg analyst posts on
[07:46] Twitter the day that one of the
[07:49] leveraged ETF products on top of micro
[07:51] strategy came out you know 1.75x
[07:54] leverage per day and I thought hm that
[07:58] looks interesting I should uh read the
[08:01] prospectus and carefully consider it so
[08:03] what I did instead is I just threw
[08:05] $10,000 into the ETF one day one without
[08:08] reading anything um but again then it
[08:10] then it had my attention and I messaged
[08:13] my uhh one friend I said hey I just
[08:15] threw 10 grand into this mstx
[08:18] ETF um what do you think about it and uh
[08:23] right it's kind of like a little test
[08:24] case and he sends me a screenshot back
[08:26] with him buying like way more than that
[08:29] like decent position especially for day
[08:31] one of an ETF trading so at the end of
[08:33] the day I uh texted him I said well
[08:35] between you and me mostly him we had
[08:38] like 0.1% of the day one inflows for
[08:41] that ETF and so I was like all right so
[08:45] uh you know over that weekend I think it
[08:47] launched on Wednesday or Thursday that
[08:48] weekend I read through the prospectus
[08:50] and like got my mind around it's like
[08:53] 1.75x per day not per year and just all
[08:58] of these nuances and you know we're
[09:01] hearing some rump Wings on Twitter about
[09:03] you know concerns about Decay or and
[09:06] like I'm just not that technical Finance
[09:09] background guy to really delve into all
[09:11] that so um yeah started looking into all
[09:15] of that but you know had had and still
[09:17] have zero
[09:18] experience um or education you know even
[09:21] self-education around
[09:23] options um trading options so I was like
[09:28] well this is for me I viewed it as my
[09:31] best shot of kind of getting leverage on
[09:33] top of micro strategy which is leverage
[09:35] long on bitcoin um so I can hold my
[09:38] Bitcoin stack but also have Micro
[09:40] strategy um you know stock and leverage
[09:45] long ETFs Andor options to um you know
[09:50] and the thought for me was well if
[09:53] bitcoin's volatility is going down from
[09:55] a 70 or 80 Vol asset to a 40 50 60 vol
[09:59] asset then maybe I should be allocating
[10:03] some new capital that I have coming in
[10:05] to um something that has a higher
[10:08] volatility for and you know higher
[10:11] likelihood of um outsize returns so that
[10:15] was my uh pretty embarrassing but you
[10:20] know it is what it is kind of story into
[10:22] micro strategy really interesting uh
[10:25] it's kind of a a leverage on bitcoin
[10:29] uh with micro strategy and then a
[10:31] leverage on on micro strategy for those
[10:33] who don't know what does 1.7x per day
[10:37] mean and what's the difference between
[10:39] per day and per year how much are we
[10:41] talking what's the the finances be
[10:43] behind that so um for easier math I'll
[10:48] talk about the mstu ETF and I am not an
[10:51] expert on these ETFs to be clear um but
[10:53] it's 2x the micro the price action on
[10:56] micro strategy on a per day basis so
[10:58] from Market open the market close so to
[11:01] speak it's going to go up two times what
[11:04] micro strategy does uh per day so if
[11:08] micro strategy is at a dollar and it
[11:10] goes to$ two doar then that ETF will
[11:13] double that price performance in that
[11:15] day and then it'll start from that point
[11:19] the next day so kind of compounding upon
[11:21] itself and maybe at least for myself the
[11:24] way I view it is if the price of micro
[11:28] strategy which is different from the
[11:30] price action of Bitcoin right if the
[11:32] price of micro strategy is chopping
[11:35] sideways or going down then that levered
[11:37] long ETF is is not something that you're
[11:39] going to want to be holding because it's
[11:42] most effective when the price is going
[11:43] up
[11:45] so um yeah that's how I kind of think
[11:48] about that very interesting do you think
[11:50] that micro strategy and there's some
[11:52] some talks around that uh I don't know
[11:54] if it's it's possible but do you think
[11:56] that micro strategy has a fair chance of
[11:58] being one of the really big companies
[12:00] like one of the the the major companies
[12:03] uh with like apple Google and the ones
[12:05] because they have been accumulating so
[12:07] early in Bitcoin maybe they even bring
[12:09] something uh some some providers and
[12:12] services around Bitcoin
[12:14] out I do I mean you have Michael sailor
[12:18] um saying on the record during
[12:20] interviews now that he his his vision
[12:23] and his goal is to make micro strategy
[12:26] into a trillion dollar company and I
[12:28] think it's interesting that uh not even
[12:31] several weeks after he came out publicly
[12:34] said that you have Microsoft uh
[12:39] putting up for a vote whether or not to
[12:42] adopt Bitcoin as a treasury strategy um
[12:46] and the reality that I don't want to
[12:48] misquote the exact metric but on on
[12:52] some earnings
[12:55] or profit level you know micro strategy
[12:58] has now out far
[13:00] Microsoft um and I mean even the on the
[13:04] ground reality of it um one of my
[13:06] friends and I were
[13:08] walking um in
[13:10] Midtown we recording on a Tuesday so on
[13:14] Saturday or Sunday we were walking we
[13:17] walked past the Microsoft store we were
[13:19] walking toward the Apple Store we look
[13:21] in the Microsoft store and um I should
[13:25] have taken a picture to kind of do a
[13:27] side by side it was compl completely
[13:29] empty I mean there were employees
[13:31] standing in there in the Microsoft store
[13:33] that kind of from the front almost looks
[13:34] like an Apple store right it's very kind
[13:36] of like like a Sleek cool All Glass and
[13:40] like the Lightwood tables so it was just
[13:43] empty and then we go we walk into the
[13:45] Apple Store and it's first of all I
[13:48] either didn't know or forgot that the
[13:50] one here um in Manhattan basically on
[13:54] Central Park South kind of across from
[13:55] The Plaza Hotel it's open 24 hours a day
[13:58] it never closed
[14:00] what and so and it's kind of always
[14:04] humming to pretty busy um we go there
[14:08] and I mean I have pictures on my phone
[14:11] it's packed I mean it's
[14:13] like wow I mean yeah it's the weekend
[14:16] it's New York but it's just packed so
[14:20] um yeah I don't know how much Microsoft
[14:23] is you know selling to the public if
[14:25] their store is completely empty in
[14:28] Manhattan on a Sunday in the Apple Store
[14:30] is just and you know micr strategy
[14:33] doesn't have a a retail store that I'm
[14:35] aware of so I I can't make that
[14:36] comparison but I mean you just see some
[14:39] of these things with your eyes and
[14:40] you're like all right um the times are
[14:43] changing and yeah I mean
[14:46] I
[14:47] um yeah I I I certainly think that if
[14:51] there's anyone uh and any team that can
[14:53] pull off uh going to the top of the
[14:55] leaderboard and becoming a trillion
[14:57] dollar company from a not even 50
[15:00] billion dollar company right now it's
[15:02] definitely micro strategy and Michael
[15:03] sailor so be it's very intriguing to
[15:06] watch all of this play out in real time
[15:09] absolutely and it's already outperformed
[15:11] since they adopted Bitcoin every single
[15:13] S&P 500 company so like it's already
[15:17] kind of playing out that uh that that
[15:20] that vision is already kind of playing
[15:22] out um it's also interesting that you
[15:25] touched on Microsoft because because uh
[15:28] before I just thought like ah it's just
[15:30] like they put something out but the more
[15:31] and more I research about it and hear
[15:34] about it I feel like it they might
[15:36] actually do
[15:37] it my last guest actually said like oh
[15:40] it's it's for sure they will do it what
[15:42] are your thoughts on on Microsoft
[15:44] actually maybe going ahead and and
[15:45] buying
[15:47] Bitcoin my gut feeling is that the
[15:49] vote's going to be close but that it's
[15:51] going to be approved and they're going
[15:53] to do it I I don't
[15:55] know and I haven't seen any real
[15:59] analysis
[16:00] on the facts around or the reality
[16:04] around Black Rock being their second
[16:07] largest shareholder and how that vote
[16:09] would go or how any of these votes would
[16:11] really go when you get down into the
[16:13] details but my gut feeling is that
[16:17] um you know it could be a close vote but
[16:20] I I find it far-fetched that um they
[16:24] would put something up for a vote and
[16:27] beat that public about it unless behind
[16:29] the scenes they were like hey this is
[16:32] we're going to be doing this it's super
[16:34] interesting uh to watch also the CTO I
[16:37] think came out and said something like
[16:39] oh I I underestimated it and it's really
[16:43] good and it has the possibility to
[16:44] change society I I misquoted but uh
[16:47] something along those lines so that
[16:49] would be huge if if
[16:52] Microsoft almost hard to confuse those
[16:55] two uh comes in yeah I mean talk about
[16:58] the game theory of The Magnificent 7 all
[17:02] adopting Bitcoin I mean don't forget
[17:04] Tesla already has it on its balance
[17:06] sheet it's you know so on the company
[17:10] level and the country level I
[17:13] think the next few months and definitely
[17:17] the next 12 to 18 months could be very
[17:20] interesting and um I would even go so
[17:23] far as to say that if you play this game
[17:26] theory out it I don't I think it's very
[17:28] realistic that you might see an 8 to 10
[17:31] year bull run with volatility Sim
[17:34] similar to what you saw when the gold
[17:35] ETF was launched so um with volatility
[17:40] meaning right you might see a 30 40 50%
[17:43] drawback but yeah I mean I have
[17:47] discussed with you know a few others
[17:51] that you
[17:53] could see less of a bare Market or even
[17:57] eliminate the bull market Market if just
[18:00] micro strategy themselves can execute
[18:05] their playbook with a lot of precision
[18:08] and with increasing size so I yeah I
[18:11] think we're in totally Uncharted
[18:13] territories as far as adoption and you
[18:17] know institutional and nation state
[18:19] adoption I think micro strategy in
[18:21] particular is going to be one of if not
[18:25] the biggest stories in corporate finance
[18:29] ever so I I think when people start to
[18:32] see it more and more on uh mainstream
[18:35] news people might start paying attention
[18:39] but I think we're very early at coin and
[18:41] even earlier to these uh corporations
[18:44] adopting it it's it's super interesting
[18:47] I want to talk about uh what what's
[18:49] what's to come also with the next eight
[18:51] to 10 years I think even Micha talked in
[18:54] madira about this possible Gold Rush era
[18:57] of the next 10 years
[18:59] um but one thing that I forgot before
[19:01] with micro strategy um what are the kind
[19:04] of the plans that micro strategy has
[19:06] because they kind of they still have
[19:08] this still they have this huge uh
[19:11] operational business that has nothing to
[19:13] do with Bitcoin uh and they have this
[19:17] huge like a lot of bitcoiners are
[19:19] involved with micro strategy a lot of
[19:21] bitcoiners are invested in micro
[19:23] strategy so it's just seems to be a
[19:25] normal step over the next years and
[19:28] decad that they actually evolve their
[19:31] operational business also more to
[19:33] towards the Bitcoin community and the
[19:34] Bitcoin ecosystem uh do you have some
[19:37] insights where where I mean not insights
[19:40] but like some some something that they
[19:42] maybe said um where micro strategies
[19:45] going from an operational
[19:47] standpoint sure I mean I have random
[19:50] Hatchet thoughts from some you know
[19:52] internet guy right um yes I think it
[19:57] makes sense that to the extent possible
[20:01] the software business will continue
[20:03] incorporating more and
[20:05] more Bitcoin development features
[20:09] anything that they can do that makes
[20:10] sense but just the software business
[20:13] throwing off that consistent cash flow
[20:16] whether they are developing Bitcoin
[20:19] Centric products and Technologies or not
[20:23] is really a key part of what makes the
[20:26] whole thing work and I would even go
[20:28] with step further and say that it would
[20:31] make complete sense and I think micro
[20:34] strategy has publicly said this that
[20:35] they may consider purchasing other cash
[20:38] flow positive businesses and adding that
[20:41] to their operation in order to have more
[20:44] free cash flow in order to um utilize
[20:48] that in their flywheel to ultimately be
[20:50] able to purchase more Bitcoin so um I
[20:54] think you know certainly it makes sense
[20:56] that they could they could and would
[21:00] incorporate Bitcoin into their products
[21:04] um but I think even if it's just
[21:07] business intelligence software and even
[21:09] if they decided to acquire other
[21:12] businesses that had nothing to do with
[21:15] uh Bitcoin that that would be all within
[21:18] their U corporate flywheel of what would
[21:21] make like absolute 100% sense to uh
[21:25] continue what they're doing with adding
[21:27] Bitcoin as fast as possible to their
[21:30] corporate treasury I partnered up with
[21:33] coin vigilante this is the most
[21:36] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[21:38] saw created by anyone look at that
[21:41] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[21:44] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[21:47] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[21:50] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[21:53] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[21:56] coin vigilante just dropped the
[21:58] completely new and amazing Genesis
[22:01] edition of their watch collections you
[22:04] have the date of the first ever minded
[22:07] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[22:10] also the block height and which Epoch we
[22:13] are currently in I love the level of
[22:16] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[22:18] and make sure to check out those amazing
[22:21] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[22:24] descriptions I love those watches so so
[22:27] much if you you watch or listen to my
[22:30] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[22:32] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[22:34] the most important step is to keep the
[22:37] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[22:40] wallet my personal recommendation for
[22:42] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[22:45] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[22:47] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[22:49] their Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[22:52] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[22:56] the checkout visit bitbox Swiss SL
[23:00] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[23:02] step is to really level up your
[23:04] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[23:07] have the most secure self- custody setup
[23:10] you have to secure your own devices you
[23:13] have to protect your privacy you have to
[23:16] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[23:18] on where you live you even want to have
[23:21] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[23:23] move in case something goes really
[23:25] really wrong and through all those steps
[23:27] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[23:30] step by step and if you visit the
[23:33] Bitcoin way.com
[23:35] Partners Robin you even get a 30 minute
[23:38] free call to find out how you can level
[23:41] up your sovereignty yeah it's super
[23:44] interesting also for me to see uh
[23:46] because even like like it starts from an
[23:49] individual level it starts on on that
[23:52] level and then it goes up to
[23:53] corporations but even maybe at some
[23:55] point nation state level uh where the
[23:58] allocation of capital uh completely
[24:01] changes when your um asset is
[24:05] accumulating on a really really fast
[24:08] pace like Bitcoin uh compared to you
[24:11] have an asset like a Euro or dollar or
[24:13] like some Bond or some something like
[24:15] that then you're way more incentivized
[24:17] to to kind of go into uh let's buy not a
[24:21] lot of companies out it's really
[24:23] interesting how maybe micro strategy is
[24:25] also doing that because they already
[24:27] have this amazing
[24:28] treasury uh but they can use that
[24:31] treasury to further buy more Bitcoin or
[24:35] to further buy some other cash flow I
[24:37] think this this this like line of like
[24:40] okay do I buy more Bitcoin with that now
[24:42] or do I buy other business with that is
[24:45] the business actually outg growing uh
[24:47] the Bitcoin long term I think that's a
[24:49] really interesting thing when Bitcoin
[24:51] becomes the new hurdle rate uh for
[24:54] corporations I mean even on on a
[24:55] individual level it's interesting uh do
[24:58] do you want to invest in uh in in in
[25:01] that new new company or you want to keep
[25:04] uh your own small thing going and maybe
[25:06] invested in in Bitcoin so like it's it's
[25:09] really interesting um H how we will do
[25:12] that that balance of that especially
[25:14] because Bitcoin is so growing so so fast
[25:17] how do you see that yeah I just think
[25:19] the ratings on the wall I mean the
[25:22] Microsoft announcement for their vote
[25:25] was just kind of like I don't think on
[25:27] most people Bingo cards for 2024 I it's
[25:31] like and it's December 10th right now
[25:33] it's the end of October I mean this
[25:35] stuff is going to be coming fast like
[25:39] really fast um but even the SAR
[25:43] Scientifics and other companies in the
[25:45] Russell 2000 that like better or worse
[25:49] they they they're positive cash flow
[25:52] companies but they're kind of zombie
[25:54] companies from a growth standpoint it
[25:57] just makes sense for all of them to put
[26:01] Bitcoin on the balance sheet I mean I
[26:03] don't think I I I don't know I I I feel
[26:07] like I'm feeling the pain of Michael
[26:09] sailor every time that he like I can
[26:12] just relate to him
[26:14] going and then he starts talking again
[26:16] because it's like Bitcoin is good for
[26:19] the individual the family the company
[26:23] the country I mean it's just like maybe
[26:26] you should buy some Bitcoin
[26:28] I was just like even conversations I
[26:31] have with friends extended family uh
[26:34] people on the street um it's just like
[26:37] oh Tim what are you you know they'll see
[26:40] you know some of the videos I've
[26:42] recorded oh so now you're some guy on
[26:45] the internet talking about Bitcoin and
[26:46] I'm like yeah I just and they're like oh
[26:50] cool yeah I don't really know anything
[26:51] about it I mean that's that's how early
[26:54] we are and so as many people say
[26:57] corporations
[26:58] companies they're just made up of people
[27:02] and when I walk around the streets very
[27:04] few people you know since January of
[27:07] 2021 99% of people I've talked to I mean
[27:11] some people literally all you know oh
[27:14] yeah what do you think about Bitcoin
[27:16] I've literally had someone say to me as
[27:18] we're just walking along oh is that
[27:19] still a
[27:20] thing I mean it's just we're early we're
[27:23] so early that it's uh and it's hard
[27:27] because of the the price bias the number
[27:30] bias when someone sees $70,000 Bitcoin
[27:34] and they don't know anything about it
[27:35] they don't know that there's a 100
[27:36] million satoshis in one Bitcoin they
[27:38] don't know that you can buy a dollar of
[27:40] Bitcoin or even less right you can buy
[27:43] one Satoshi yeah it's we're just so
[27:45] early it's almost unfathomable just you
[27:47] know to anyone that's really been
[27:51] studying Bitcoin for a number of months
[27:53] or years to go out into the actual world
[27:57] and see that very very few people even
[27:59] have you know maybe the desire but I
[28:02] really I think everyone or most people
[28:05] are trying the best that they can I
[28:09] mean they
[28:11] have families they have jobs they have
[28:15] um just a lot of commitments that to
[28:18] actually spend 10 hours studying Bitcoin
[28:22] to come to the conclusion that the
[28:23] government's going to ban it that's a
[28:25] lot of time for them and then they're at
[28:27] that that stage where they're just like
[28:29] okay well the government's going to ban
[28:31] Bitcoin so cool I'm good and so like who
[28:36] has a hundred hours to study Bitcoin um
[28:39] it's it's definitely the highest and
[28:40] best use of anyone's time to study
[28:42] Bitcoin but after a 100 hours you're
[28:45] like okay well it's digital gold and so
[28:49] yeah maybe I'll buy it and it'll reach
[28:51] the market cap of gold someday and uh
[28:54] you know but that
[28:55] seems and I'm speaking of like you know
[28:58] someone just try trying to go on the
[29:00] journey well that seems a
[29:02] little unrealistic because that would be
[29:05] and I'm gonna mess up the numbers here
[29:08] right 700 800 $900,000 of Bitcoin like
[29:11] well that's ridiculous that's never
[29:13] going to happen like most people are
[29:14] just
[29:15] not uh I shouldn't say most a lot of
[29:19] people are not numbers people they're
[29:21] not Finance people they're not curious
[29:24] or open people they're just trying to
[29:25] live their lives and do the best they
[29:27] can for their family I think the more
[29:29] Avenues and the more doors we have for
[29:31] people to walk through um whether it's
[29:34] studying Bitcoin and um learning and
[29:39] embracing self- custody or whether it's
[29:41] buying it on an exchange or whether it's
[29:42] buying it through an ETF or whether
[29:45] someone is talking to their friends and
[29:47] they're saying oh there's this Equity
[29:48] micro strategy that no one's ever heard
[29:50] of and it's really
[29:52] outperforming you know I bought some you
[29:55] know maybe you should buy some or right
[29:57] I
[29:58] this is what I'm doing and then your
[30:00] buddy's like oh maybe I'll buy some
[30:01] micro strategy it's just an equity
[30:03] you're not even talking about Bitcoin
[30:05] and I'm not saying that that's the right
[30:07] door to go through I'm just saying I
[30:08] think the reality is some of that you
[30:10] know might be happening so Bitcoins for
[30:14] everyone so the more doors people can
[30:17] walk through to get to bitcoin I think
[30:19] the
[30:20] better absolutely yeah it's and it's
[30:22] fascinating how early we are there are
[30:24] those um like you just have to go out in
[30:26] the street and ask people
[30:28] uh what they think you just have to go
[30:30] out in in your far away family maybe
[30:33] that you didn't border too much till now
[30:35] with Bitcoin and ask them about Bitcoin
[30:38] um uh some of them maybe get that the
[30:42] Euro or the dollar is not the best
[30:43] vehicle to store value some are that
[30:46] that far already uh yeah sorry go ahead
[30:50] oh yeah I mean one of the episodes I put
[30:53] out the gentleman I work with here um
[30:56] doing the recording and editing he's
[30:57] like hey what do you think the title for
[30:59] this one should be and I just texted him
[31:01] uh if you don't own Bitcoin you will be
[31:03] poor and he was like oh I like that
[31:05] title and it's like I'm not trying to be
[31:08] uh
[31:09] dramatic like you literally if you look
[31:11] on YouTube in the description in the
[31:13] show notes it just says like the reason
[31:16] I titled that video If You Don't Own
[31:18] Bitcoin you will be poor is because the
[31:20] ECB literally came out and said that a
[31:21] week ago they said bitcoin's unfair
[31:24] bitcoin's so unfair because if you don't
[31:27] own Bitcoin and that was your conclusion
[31:29] if you don't own Bitcoin you will be
[31:30] poor you're like I'm not making this
[31:32] stuff up I'm not trying to be dramatic
[31:34] I'm just trying to like use my time and
[31:38] my skills and my talents to like what's
[31:41] the highest and best use of my talents
[31:42] ability and time well going around and
[31:45] trying to like talk one-on-one with
[31:47] people about Bitcoin is sometimes fun
[31:50] sometimes rewarding sometimes very
[31:53] frustrating and so I feel very strongly
[31:56] that the best thing I can do with my
[31:58] time is educate people about Bitcoin and
[32:03] the best platform to do that is social
[32:05] media the internet where whoever wants
[32:09] to educate themselves or get information
[32:12] and obviously make their own decisions
[32:14] from a financial and legal and all these
[32:16] different aspects we're not giving them
[32:18] advice we're trying to put information
[32:20] out there to make it um you know
[32:23] hopefully make it entertaining right I I
[32:26] do think you don't really have Effective
[32:29] Education Without some sort of
[32:31] entertainment aspect to it um and that's
[32:34] not to say that you have to like you
[32:36] know do cartwheels or like jump up and
[32:38] down or you know put on a silly hat but
[32:40] think the ease and and maybe this is
[32:43] different from the entertainment part of
[32:45] it the ease with which someone can pull
[32:48] up YouTube or any other platform put in
[32:52] some airpods and go for a walk and
[32:55] listen to some information on a video
[32:59] it's so easy for so many people to do
[33:02] now that I think like that's just it's
[33:05] such a wonderful
[33:07] platform to put the information out
[33:09] there and it's like a buffet if people
[33:11] want some corn they want some hot dogs
[33:14] they want some salad they want some
[33:16] green beans they can choose whatever
[33:18] they want um and we're not forcing it on
[33:21] them right I'm not ruining a family
[33:23] relationship because all I want to do is
[33:25] talk about Bitcoin um and I've been
[33:28] there right I've really hopefully many
[33:30] relationships over it but yeah the
[33:33] community on Twitter the community in
[33:37] real life whether you're meeting people
[33:40] organically in your circle that they you
[33:44] know enjoy talking about Bitcoin or
[33:47] whether you're finding those people on
[33:49] Twitter or wherever else online and then
[33:51] meeting them at an event um and having
[33:54] that relationship kind of flourish from
[33:56] there I mean I just think that
[33:58] it's kind of I think it's obvious that
[34:00] like that's the better route to go right
[34:03] you're not trying to like convince
[34:05] anyone of anything you're um you know
[34:08] studying and educating yourself and then
[34:11] having conversations and putting those
[34:12] conversations out there um for whoever
[34:15] wants to partake in them and and I think
[34:17] it's a really powerful way to to start a
[34:20] conversation absolutely yeah and I was
[34:23] just going with that uh the the video
[34:25] that I saw last time um was fascinating
[34:30] people uh were asking other people what
[34:33] the current price of Bitcoin is and
[34:36] that's was like oh like normal people
[34:38] probably know at least a little bit of
[34:40] the Bitcoin price uh even though they
[34:43] know nothing else like the Bitcoin price
[34:45] is the first thing to see because it's
[34:47] in all the headlines if it makes alltime
[34:48] highs all some lows or something like
[34:51] that uh so uh that was falling will be
[34:55] probably not that bad but people said
[34:57] anything like like oh what two EUR or
[34:59] like oh 20 like I was like what anything
[35:03] and I think the highest someone said was
[35:05] 2,000 and this was to a time uh where
[35:09] Bitcoin was way up than that so that
[35:12] it's really fascinating to see uh how
[35:14] how early we actually
[35:16] are absolutely yeah it's kind of
[35:18] unbelievable I
[35:20] think Jack dorsy with cash app in
[35:24] particular um has tried to
[35:28] make the the price where you can switch
[35:32] between Bitcoin and Satoshi and dollars
[35:35] as far as what the display is is trying
[35:37] to maybe further that conversation in a
[35:40] positive direction because again and and
[35:43] actually the ETFs right Black Rock
[35:46] Fidelity bitwise all of these ETFs when
[35:50] you go into your brokerage account and
[35:52] you can buy one share of the
[35:54] bitwise Bitcoin ETF for whatever the
[35:58] price is I don't know what it is $30 $10
[36:01] $70 whatever that share price is $200
[36:05] whatever it is like oh okay well yeah I
[36:08] can buy a share or I can buy 10 shares
[36:11] or 100 shares of this ETF and you know
[36:15] that that makes I mean I know for myself
[36:17] that you know kind puff out my chest and
[36:20] say oh yeah I own 100 shares of the uh
[36:23] you know Bitcoin ETF yeah you know I'm
[36:25] in the game but would you go to an
[36:28] exchange and you're like well I only got
[36:32] 0.00001
[36:33] Bitcoin for the same price like it just
[36:37] I think psychologically really does a
[36:39] number on people so um yeah the more
[36:42] that we can talk about you know kind of
[36:45] switching that unit of account to
[36:47] satoshi's or people buying the ETFs or
[36:51] you know even the 10 for one stock split
[36:53] on micro strategy I think you know for
[36:55] whatever multiple reasons they did that
[36:58] right I I'm sure people enjoy buying one
[37:01] chair for $50 or $100 rather than
[37:05] $1,000 so um yeah I think all all of
[37:09] those things are very helpful um for The
[37:13] Human Condition when it comes to
[37:15] adoption I just looked up it's it's $40
[37:18] so it's actually really nice to have
[37:20] have an bitcoin price that is at under
[37:23] $100 even though it's like Bitcoin ETF
[37:25] but it's I think that that's a good uh
[37:28] good thing I never looked at that it's
[37:30] interesting to to see that really cool
[37:32] also the ECP I think one other aspect
[37:35] what you brought up with that paper was
[37:38] there kind of at like Bitcoin to 10
[37:41] million price Target in there uh where
[37:44] they made this example with 10 million
[37:47] uh Euros per per Bitcoin it was really
[37:50] fascinating to see that paper because
[37:53] the the the underlying um message that I
[37:57] got from the paper is like they are
[37:59] scared they're like we have to we cannot
[38:03] stop it now let's tax it massively
[38:07] that's kind of the the message that I
[38:09] got from that paper and it's really
[38:11] interesting to see how how this goes
[38:13] with with the uh ECP I hope uh taxes are
[38:17] not increasing in in Europe otherwise
[38:19] might have to leave here but but yeah
[38:23] yeah I think that's super interesting
[38:26] because well whether certain
[38:29] organizations or countries are putting
[38:31] out papers that they truly believe that
[38:34] or they're saying it for a multitude of
[38:36] specific reasons Bitcoin is going to go
[38:40] to whichever jurisdiction it's treated
[38:42] best so like right the UAE the United
[38:48] States El Salvador I think if all of
[38:52] these countries are not
[38:54] already understanding of this they will
[38:56] be very shortly that yeah if you want to
[39:00] put a tax that's that's higher than some
[39:03] other jurisdiction on
[39:05] bitcoin you're going to see those flows
[39:09] go flow out and go somewhere else and
[39:13] yeah maybe you'll tax it you know for
[39:15] that on that onetime exit event but you
[39:18] know money is a very
[39:21] powerful um
[39:22] motivator and causes people to take
[39:25] certain actions and so um I'm not saying
[39:28] that you know no one should ever tax
[39:30] anything but on the other hand you know
[39:34] strong believer in the meme if you can
[39:36] just print as much money as you want why
[39:39] are you taxing us why am I being taxed
[39:43] if you can just print money at will like
[39:46] it blows my mind it makes no sense why
[39:48] am I being taxed you could just print
[39:50] the money and and like that the whole
[39:53] system is so messed up that like I'm not
[39:56] you know you should be printing money
[39:58] that's not the solution but if that's
[40:00] the Fiat world that we're in like you
[40:03] have some political candidates around
[40:05] the world saying oh well you know if we
[40:09] increase or do certain tariffs then
[40:13] maybe we'll get rid of some of these
[40:15] taxes and when you look on a a longer
[40:18] time frame not the last 10 years or the
[40:21] last 20 30 50 years but a 100 200 years
[40:25] ago some of these countries didn't have
[40:28] tax or they had tax for a certain reason
[40:32] and then after a certain time it was
[40:33] gone there was no more tax but then you
[40:36] know they started taxing again and you
[40:39] just keep taxing and taxing and taxing I
[40:41] think within the next five to 10 years
[40:44] we're going to be living in a world that
[40:45] we cannot imagine right now from a tax
[40:49] standpoint from a technology standpoint
[40:51] from a freedom standpoint and I think
[40:55] it's going to be amazing all my family
[40:57] and friends know that I'm like the ever
[40:59] Optimist like there's a glass of water
[41:02] it's not like half full like this glass
[41:04] is completely full of water right now I
[41:06] know it doesn't look like it but it's
[41:08] completely full of water like that's how
[41:10] optimistic I am about our future and I
[41:13] when I say our future I mean all all of
[41:15] humanity and the reason for it comes
[41:18] down to bitcoin i l that a lot yeah
[41:20] really cool I think uh bit CR is could
[41:24] usher in some um it's some sounds
[41:27] romantic but I think uh as in abundance
[41:30] uh it's actually could happen what what
[41:34] bitco brings but maybe let's uh stay a
[41:36] little bit in the in the medium term
[41:39] with the taxes and all the things going
[41:41] on in the ECP what do you think will be
[41:44] the implications if we actually hit in
[41:46] the next coming years this 100K 500k 1
[41:50] million priz Target what what you expect
[41:52] is is like before we get to this uh
[41:55] great Point uh is there like
[41:58] an an ugly ugly time zone in there for
[42:02] bitcoiners is there like we'll try to
[42:05] tax it like what do you kind of expect
[42:08] when when Bitcoin uh comes up and up in
[42:11] in the price levels in intenal levels in
[42:14] on on the on the global uh uh Global
[42:19] balance sheet of the world great
[42:20] question I think the and you can apply
[42:25] this I think to most things in life
[42:27] the best indicator of anyone's or
[42:32] anything's future
[42:34] performance is their past performance
[42:36] and so if we look over the last 15 years
[42:39] was there anything wild or ugly or
[42:43] disruptive like riots in the streets
[42:46] because of Bitcoin I mean maybe there
[42:49] are a few stories here and there that
[42:51] I'm not aware of but like it's been a
[42:54] pretty peaceful adoption so far and I
[42:56] think the fact that you have nation
[42:58] states and cities that have adopted
[43:00] Bitcoin as legal tender I think the fact
[43:02] that you have black rock infidelity and
[43:04] bitwise and all of these institutions in
[43:07] the US and many other countries um
[43:11] putting it in this ETF wrapper I think
[43:13] you'll have the US dollar you'll have
[43:15] stable coins and that's
[43:18] your checking account and then I think
[43:21] you're starting to see conversations
[43:24] just over the past few weeks come more
[43:26] and more to the the Forefront here in
[43:28] the US with certain individuals on
[43:31] mainstream media and podcasts saying
[43:34] that Bitcoin is a commodity now we all
[43:37] know that Bitcoin is a commodity but
[43:39] many people are kind of
[43:42] holding in their hands and saying as far
[43:46] as the narrative that Bitcoin is a
[43:48] commodity but they also say that it's a
[43:52] currency and if we can if we can get
[43:54] away from saying that it's a currency
[43:57] and understand that it's like oil like
[44:00] it's like corn Bitcoin is a commodity
[44:04] and whether it should be taxed or not I
[44:06] think comes I think where we're going is
[44:10] that Bitcoin as a
[44:12] commodity will not be taxed I think
[44:15] Bitcoin as a security if you're trading
[44:19] it um in some sort of securitized
[44:22] product and making a profit then that
[44:24] will be taxed I think Bitcoin is a
[44:27] commodity if I go up to you and say
[44:31] Here's a Bitcoin in the same way that I
[44:34] can go up to you and say Here's a barrel
[44:36] of
[44:36] oil like um yeah I don't think as a
[44:42] commodity in the future it will be taxed
[44:46] so I think we're just starting to see
[44:48] that and I could be wrong but that's
[44:50] that's my thought there interesting so
[44:53] as a commodity where do you see it then
[44:55] uh longterm do you think it's it will
[44:58] always stay an asset and then paired
[45:01] with with fat uh you have like fat as
[45:04] this medum of exchange and unit of
[45:06] account and and Bitcoin is just this
[45:07] Global World Reserve asset or commodity
[45:11] however you want to label it is that the
[45:12] the future you see yeah exactly I do
[45:16] think that as long as you have nation
[45:18] states um you'll have the the fiat
[45:21] currency maybe it will uh be backed by
[45:24] Bitcoin maybe it'll be backed by basket
[45:28] of uh currencies and assets including
[45:31] Bitcoin gold silver um I think every
[45:34] Sovereign will need to make that
[45:36] decision for themselves and just like
[45:39] some of the stories that we tell with
[45:41] trying to figure out a new Financial
[45:43] product and you need to do experiments I
[45:45] think you'll see countries do
[45:46] experiments and I think that's great I
[45:48] think that's how we learn and I think
[45:50] yeah I think that's yeah I think that's
[45:53] a future that is very positive the we
[45:57] can get
[45:58] to either using Bitcoin or having a fiat
[46:03] currency that's that's somehow linked or
[46:05] backed by Bitcoin or a basket of of of
[46:09] uh assets again we're just kind of
[46:11] hopefully inching closer and closer to a
[46:14] more Equitable World which fnally is the
[46:18] exact opposite of what you're hearing
[46:20] from some of these nations right now as
[46:23] far as um the current fud fear
[46:26] uncertainty and doubt that's it's coming
[46:27] out but um I think it's all part of the
[46:30] adoption and and all part of the
[46:33] process absolutely really cool um before
[46:37] we come to the end routine I want to uh
[46:39] know a little bit more about you uh what
[46:41] are you doing with uh Hile royalty do do
[46:45] I pronounce it right or Jubilee royalty
[46:48] what are you doing there yeah no I love
[46:51] I love your pronunciation I might kind
[46:53] of makes it sound more fancy so I like
[46:55] that but uh yeah Jubilee royalty is my
[46:58] day job and uh so we have historically
[47:02] raised capital and purchased and then
[47:06] strategically you know after we let cash
[47:08] flow for a few years sell energy assets
[47:11] specifically in natural gas and oil
[47:13] basins here domestically yeah I I manage
[47:16] those uh funds in a private Equity sort
[47:20] of style um but um yeah we're just
[47:23] deploying some capital from the raise
[47:25] that we just did and and yeah managing
[47:28] and and uh exiting those uh Vehicles as
[47:32] um the
[47:33] opportunities arise so um that's what
[47:37] I'm doing there and um yeah moving
[47:40] forward I think it'll be interesting to
[47:42] see um what opportunities um present
[47:46] themselves to uh you know either do more
[47:49] in the energy space or you spent some
[47:52] time uh learning more about the Venture
[47:55] Capital space and just see where the
[47:58] opportunities are either in my
[48:00] traditional background in um Venture
[48:05] Capital um and most importantly in
[48:09] Bitcoin um and and where we can
[48:12] intelligently allocate Capital to um you
[48:16] know Drive adoption forward absolutely
[48:18] yeah really really cool I L that a lot
[48:20] uh perfect then one question that every
[48:21] one of my guests get is what can we
[48:23] learn from you besides uh Bitcoin what
[48:26] can you learn from me besides Bitcoin
[48:29] yeah however you want to or wherever you
[48:32] want to take this question yeah no great
[48:35] question think on that for a second I
[48:37] mean my background's in the energy uh
[48:40] sector um so
[48:42] negotiating um leases and purchase
[48:45] agreements and other land agreements
[48:47] with
[48:49] um you know whoever owns that property
[48:51] whe whether it's an individual or a
[48:53] corporation and then you know um
[48:56] negotiate with them and their attorneys
[48:58] so um yeah I'm I'm passionate about um
[49:03] education being able to um convey those
[49:07] ideas to other people whether it's um
[49:11] you know in energy whether it's in
[49:13] Bitcoin um when I first moved to New
[49:16] York a little over five years ago I I
[49:18] took a little pause and I I said to
[49:21] myself okay we've we've done a few
[49:23] things in life what should we do now and
[49:26] and you know I don't know if it's from a
[49:28] first principal perspective but I just
[49:30] simply ask my question myself the
[49:33] question what do I enjoy doing right
[49:36] because you can go do lots of things and
[49:38] try to make a difference in the world or
[49:40] try to make a bunch of money or you know
[49:42] whatever you want to do like what do I
[49:45] really enjoy doing and I really enjoy
[49:47] doing two PE two things I
[49:50] enjoy meeting people and I enjoy like
[49:54] putting deals together uh meeting
[49:56] business deals or like whatever a
[49:58] win-win is like putting deals together
[50:01] could be as simple as I've met two
[50:04] people and I think they would uh really
[50:07] benefit from meeting each other and so I
[50:09] introduce them and it's not a business
[50:11] deal but it's just trying to add value
[50:14] um and so I don't know if that's
[50:17] something that people um could learn
[50:20] from me but you know maybe more to the
[50:23] aspect of what I'm focusing on now with
[50:27] some of these uh interviews is like I
[50:31] think it's it's so exciting for me
[50:33] personally to be able to meet people and
[50:37] then you know have this video right I
[50:40] mean what's a video on the on YouTube
[50:41] it's it's a digital
[50:43] product um so yeah I I just I guess
[50:49] people yeah that's such a good question
[50:51] what could people learn from you besides
[50:54] you know maybe my passion about Bitcoin
[50:56] yeah I might need to uh get back to back
[50:59] to you on that and put it as a comment
[51:00] in the uh in the notes when the when
[51:02] this comes out how about that it will
[51:05] come out in around two weeks so so you
[51:07] have a lot of time to think about that
[51:09] awesome yeah I might I might need two
[51:11] weeks to think about that question it's
[51:12] very good so thank you I mean that
[51:15] that's that's the that's the best
[51:16] questions where you don't immediately
[51:19] have an answer to I think that that's a
[51:21] uh I
[51:22] mean maybe it's bad to make a podcast
[51:26] only around those questions but I I
[51:28] always try to like get uh uh get get
[51:31] something new out of a guest
[51:33] and that that is one question that I
[51:36] found uh gets a new side or new rhythm
[51:40] in the podcast so yeah uh definitely an
[51:43] interesting one get gets people thinking
[51:45] really cool we have an end routine in
[51:47] the podcast where this is also one one
[51:49] of my routines where I try to uh get
[51:52] something new out of guest or get
[51:54] something new into the podcast with end
[51:56] the podcast where the previous guest is
[51:58] asking a question for the next guest
[52:00] without knowing who the next guest
[52:01] actually is um the question is will
[52:04] Bitcoin Banks be a thing so that's the
[52:06] question for me yeah that's the question
[52:08] for you from the previous guest
[52:10] absolutely yeah I absolutely think
[52:12] Bitcoin banks will be a thing I think
[52:14] you'll have um you know many many many
[52:18] Bitcoin Banks I think micro strategy
[52:20] will be a Bitcoin bank and I think that
[52:22] all of the existing traditional banks
[52:24] will be Bitcoin Banks I think you'll be
[52:25] able to walk in into a branch uh in your
[52:28] hometown and you'll be able to buy
[52:30] Bitcoin and you'll put it in your
[52:31] Bitcoin savings account and I think it's
[52:34] going to be awesome I love that a lot by
[52:37] the way in Germany it's uh there's like
[52:39] a big uh brand already doing that like a
[52:42] Traditional Bank they're just like
[52:43] offering now Bitcoin because there are
[52:45] some bitcoiners in the bank and they
[52:47] just like did that and they even like
[52:49] throw events with over people uh yearly
[52:52] uh really cool Bitcoin things so like
[52:55] banks are like
[52:57] they they will be friendly to bitcoin I
[52:59] think they will not be opposed to
[53:01] bitcoin central banks might be opposed
[53:03] to bitcoin but the local commercial
[53:05] Banks not so I love that question from
[53:07] previous guest yeah and also your answer
