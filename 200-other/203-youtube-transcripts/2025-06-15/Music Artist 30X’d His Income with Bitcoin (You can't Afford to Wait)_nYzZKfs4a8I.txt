[00:00] probably what 30X just Spotify earnings
[00:03] 30X in 12 months we see inflation
[00:06] destroy every industry what F does it's
[00:08] the death of rock and roll and it's the
[00:10] death of anti-establishment rhetoric
[00:13] this way we can have artists earn real
[00:15] money and really give a big middle
[00:17] finger up to the establishment I eat
[00:19] better I sleep more I have more free
[00:22] time to be able to help people I think
[00:24] someone accepting Bitcoin for their
[00:27] produce whether it be a farmer with
[00:29] their beef whe it be the local florist
[00:31] love is going to go into what they
[00:33] produce because their passion becomes
[00:36] meaningful when you're incentive and
[00:38] passion Collide amazing things happen
[00:41] Bitcoin is incentivizing the artist to
[00:43] be an artist again not being distractive
[00:45] with all the other
[00:47] [Music]
[00:51] things did you check out any of long
[00:53] music I mean we're we're we've been
[00:56] doing a lot of stuff on in the value for
[00:58] Value um verse the value verse they call
[01:01] it decentralized music you know with
[01:05] Fountain W Lake have you heard of all
[01:07] these these things oh yeah I Fountain um
[01:11] I wasn't aware that there's music also I
[01:14] found interesting so yeah so basically
[01:17] long is old friend of mine um I
[01:20] introduced him to like wav Lake and the
[01:22] idea of putting his music
[01:24] on uh into the value verse into Bitcoin
[01:28] and um yeah I mean it's safe to say
[01:30] you're probably what 30X just Spotify
[01:34] earnings 30 30X in 12
[01:38] months
[01:40] wow yeah and obviously you know Spotify
[01:43] gets paid you get paid in dollars or
[01:45] pounds they convert it dollars dollars
[01:47] so he gets paid in you know one of the
[01:49] top shitcoins and in the in the value
[01:52] verse he gets paid in Bitcoin which yeah
[01:55] sits in a wallet and is the 30 a is that
[02:00] uh when we talk about Bitcoin without
[02:03] the appreciation on on the date it's
[02:07] it's paid or is that with the
[02:10] appreciation uh good question no I think
[02:13] that's that's include I mean 30 might
[02:15] not even be right it might be more than
[02:17] that it's probably more than that now of
[02:19] appreciation yeah yeah because that's a
[02:22] big thing right you if if you calculate
[02:24] in the the gain depreciation especially
[02:28] because it's the quickest way and the
[02:30] cheapest way to get to bitcoin if you
[02:32] directly get paid in in Bitcoin um that
[02:35] that's really cool yeah let's just
[02:37] directly stump into that uh why did you
[02:39] decide in the first place to to to see
[02:42] the value for Value space and the the
[02:45] how could did you call it value verse I
[02:47] I like that name yeah I think there's I
[02:50] think the whole language I mean this
[02:52] this has been an ongoing discussion it
[02:54] between me and you about you know
[02:55] there's there's a lot of things in
[02:57] Bitcoin where one person's value verse
[03:00] is another person's deu which is like
[03:03] short for decentralized music you know
[03:05] just just like how how one person's
[03:08] private seed is another person's uh
[03:11] private key you know there's these
[03:14] little idiosyncracies where the the
[03:17] language is not quite Universal so you
[03:19] definitely so you have like different
[03:21] you know different terminologies for
[03:22] different things so I know a lot of the
[03:24] American guys oh yeah they call it the
[03:27] value verse they call it V for V I think
[03:29] really good I think that's it's just
[03:32] it's just
[03:33] instantly instantly does you know tells
[03:36] you what it is so it's like
[03:37] makes yeah give him give him back so
[03:40] it's essentially I think Adam Curry do
[03:42] you know Adam Curry uh yeah the The
[03:45] Godfather of podcasting yeah the Pod
[03:47] father they call him he um he obviously
[03:51] uh introduced the whole value for Value
[03:52] thing but I think also radio head also
[03:55] did it probably around the similar time
[03:57] actually it's probably around the
[03:58] similar time when when Adam was was that
[04:01] in rainbows when Adam Curry started his
[04:04] podcast No Agenda 15 16 years ago radio
[04:09] head did a similar thing um and and Adam
[04:12] Curry's thing was
[04:14] always um value is what it means to you
[04:18] so we're not going to tell you pay5 to
[04:21] subscribe a month it's whatever you can
[04:23] afford you know whatever you want to
[04:24] give us give us and radio head with
[04:27] their album in rainbows it was exactly
[04:29] the same premise it was like our album
[04:32] is free to download on the website if
[04:34] you want to give us any money go for it
[04:36] you can give us whatever you think it
[04:37] was and that led to some people giving
[04:40] them like ,000 pounds you know and some
[04:42] people you know giving like 50p whatever
[04:45] but radio head ended up making more
[04:48] money from that one album than they had
[04:50] made from all of their albums put
[04:54] together under record label Etc um so
[04:58] for me I I already knew about the radio
[05:01] head that that economic model and with
[05:04] Bitcoin you know it's growing so big and
[05:06] people are building so much stuff on it
[05:08] all the time um I knew it was only a
[05:11] matter of time that this this would it
[05:13] you know this would this would grow to
[05:16] you know incorporating music
[05:18] incorporating all those things and it
[05:20] and it and I suppose ultimately it
[05:22] destroys the Facebook model of ads and
[05:26] YouTube in a way you know because rather
[05:29] than me having pay5 a month or whatever
[05:31] it is to subscribe to YouTube I don't
[05:33] get any ads we don't get any ads on WB
[05:35] Lake we just you know feel like we can
[05:37] share value backwards and forwards and
[05:39] micro
[05:40] payments yeah that that that
[05:43] seems It's really interesting when we
[05:45] look at the ad model do do you think the
[05:47] ad model will actually completely be be
[05:50] vanished and it will be value for value
[05:52] or or is there a place for like an ad
[05:54] model I mean there are different kinds
[05:56] of AD models there's a YouTube ad ad
[05:58] model where uh they just Place uh ads
[06:01] that they think is good then there's
[06:04] like the cooperation and partnership ad
[06:06] model where uh companies pay a podcaster
[06:09] to to I don't know wear a shirt or
[06:12] whatever uh and uh there's different
[06:15] kinds of that but the we're talking now
[06:17] probably about that traditional YouTube
[06:20] ad model where they just put random ads
[06:23] in in in in the video
[06:26] stream yeah I mean
[06:30] it's um for me YouTube is becoming
[06:34] almost unwatchable because the amount of
[06:36] ads that are going in there you're watch
[06:37] like a five minute video and there'll be
[06:39] a minute and a half worth of ads in the
[06:40] video do you know what I mean and and
[06:43] and yeah like I said I don't I don't
[06:45] necessarily want to subscribe I think
[06:47] hether said the other day on radio detox
[06:50] I think all of these models will exist
[06:52] but obviously when you're looking at
[06:54] clickbait clickbait is really generated
[06:57] by the fact that they need to sell their
[07:00] website to advertisers and they need to
[07:03] prove that they get a certain amount of
[07:04] hits hence why you get sub
[07:07] sensationalist headlines and the thing
[07:09] is with our news uh with our news cycle
[07:12] in the
[07:13] UK um you know it's constantly pushing
[07:16] out Sensational headlines and it's all
[07:18] just to create a comment or create a
[07:22] reaction um for people to get triggered
[07:24] by it do you know what I mean so they
[07:26] they'll visit the website or they'll you
[07:28] know write a click right click and send
[07:30] a message or you know vent about it um
[07:34] whereas for me the value verse I think
[07:37] does completely it will obsolete those
[07:40] models eventually but um we're we're
[07:43] really early at the moment so there's a
[07:45] place for all of them yeah definitely I
[07:47] think it's weird and and I love kind of
[07:49] that um the music industry is such a
[07:52] good example I think of how there's an
[07:55] artist Kate Nash I don't know if you've
[07:57] heard of from over there but um was
[07:59] quite big she had like a hit I reckon
[08:01] about must been 15 years ago was he yeah
[08:04] um and he so mad literally I caught it
[08:06] yesterday on on Instagram I think it was
[08:09] and she was it's for BBC Radio 6 and she
[08:11] just said about this kind of coming up
[08:14] but there's not she because she's just
[08:16] like the industry the music industry is
[08:18] it's destroyed it's destroyed itself
[08:21] basically but and and I don't think
[08:23] enough artists
[08:24] know um or or trust this because of
[08:29] because of they've been so damaged by
[08:30] the music industry so I
[08:32] think there they this it was slowly you
[08:36] know like myself Joe Martin other people
[08:39] s we Lake that as long as you keep on
[08:42] going I think people will slowly just
[08:44] start coming to the table um and rightly
[08:47] so because of like you know to to to get
[08:52] vtv um I suppose machine going it's
[08:55] going to take a while but you know of
[08:57] course artists they got to survive
[09:02] what do you think is the the influence
[09:04] of of the bad monetary system to that
[09:07] and and what part of is just like human
[09:11] human nature of of uh wanting to click
[09:13] on shiny things is is is the the feat or
[09:16] the bad monetary system making it like
[09:18] the the shorttime preference the they're
[09:21] wanting it everything now because the
[09:23] the money is fleeing away what part what
[09:26] part is that playing in in the music
[09:27] being destroyed and and that thing
[09:31] um I think I think I think they're
[09:33] running out of ideas I think I think or
[09:35] labels are just running out of ideas of
[09:37] where to they can where they can
[09:40] basically monetize their or get their
[09:42] money back
[09:43] from you know we we haven't what was it
[09:46] was it you that said to me the other day
[09:48] it might been you that sent it about how
[09:49] many bands or artists were actually or
[09:51] how many bands were in the top 10 or was
[09:53] it was it in the top 10 or something top
[09:56] top 50 of like any of the charts and
[09:58] it's like it's void because No Label
[10:00] wants to put money anymore into you know
[10:03] five people on stage when they know that
[10:06] somebody can just do it at home on a
[10:09] computer or just get one an artist out
[10:11] on their own so I think I think they
[10:13] just running out of ideas I think
[10:16] um I think that yeah I mean it'll be
[10:18] really interesting to see what kind of
[10:20] deals go but it all comes from greed
[10:22] anyway and people basically have just
[10:24] taken the piss out of I think the split
[10:27] like 99% record label 1% of the artists
[10:31] so so the proof of work I mean that's a
[10:33] proof of stake system because you've got
[10:35] a record label that has you know
[10:38] infinite power due to just being
[10:41] established a long time and having
[10:43] having the ability to build up the fear
[10:45] but I think ultimately fear and we've
[10:48] seen it we see it in every industry we
[10:50] see inflation destroy every industry I
[10:52] think fear What Fear does is it's the
[10:54] death of rock and row and it's the death
[10:56] of anti-establishment rhetoric
[11:00] you know because during Co for
[11:03] example we had I think five real famous
[11:08] rock stars pop stars talk out about the
[11:10] tyranny of you know clim of of covid
[11:15] sorry and you know for a fact it's
[11:18] because the record companies have power
[11:20] over their artists that if you say
[11:23] anything think you're going to lose your
[11:24] recording contract and that's a very
[11:26] centralized fear thing to do you you
[11:29] mustn't you must conform at all times
[11:33] whereas I don't know about you but I
[11:35] would prefer my rock and roll stars to
[11:37] be speaking out if the government
[11:39] started taking a piss look at you know
[11:41] Sex Pistols and all that back in the 70s
[11:44] it was very much a punk movement that
[11:47] came out of an anti-establishment
[11:50] position whereas now all of the the
[11:53] supposed rock and roll stars that appear
[11:55] at Glastonbury or that get all the big
[11:57] gigs they want say anything to anything
[12:00] in fact they they'd insist on seeing
[12:02] your vaccine passport before you come
[12:04] into the geek and the idea that rock and
[12:06] roll Stars parrot the establishment's
[12:10] message I think that's ultimately what
[12:13] fat does to the industry you know I
[12:16] heard a story there's a band called Soft
[12:18] playay now they're called Soft play but
[12:20] they were called
[12:21] slaves and they they I can't be specific
[12:25] but I'm pretty sure they changed their
[12:26] name because of because of they weren't
[12:28] really getting they weren't getting some
[12:30] love by certain people so because they
[12:32] were slaves yeah you know what I mean so
[12:34] it's like the algorithm can pick it up a
[12:36] punk band yeah so it's like it's mad
[12:39] where we go I think you know there
[12:41] there's only a couple of of bands that I
[12:42] think are speaking out about anything
[12:44] and it'd be interesting to see what
[12:46] happens to Idols yeah to see if they
[12:48] come over to to the v2v kind of system
[12:50] and it be one of them's got to do it and
[12:53] I think that's when you'll get the sway
[12:54] of a lot of bands and artists coming
[12:56] over yeah so I think that's what it is
[12:58] it's just that that ability freedom of
[13:00] speech to be able to speak out without
[13:02] fear of being cancelled because much
[13:04] like we had all the doctors and um all
[13:07] most public figures during covid they
[13:09] wouldn't go against the
[13:10] narrative and you know I want my rockars
[13:13] to be a little bit more like longy and
[13:16] not like Sam Smith to be honest I don't
[13:20] think yeah I mean you know what I mean
[13:22] yeah because because everyone came I
[13:24] don't know if you know who Sam Smith is
[13:26] but he's he's obviously um he's a huge
[13:29] pop star in in this country but he's so
[13:32] kind of um well I mean every every flag
[13:36] that he can wave he waves that flag
[13:39] whether it's a rainbow one or whatever
[13:41] do you know what I mean and and to me
[13:44] that is the establishment message with
[13:46] whether it through ESG whether it
[13:48] through all the companies that change
[13:50] their Flags to Rainbow Flags you know he
[13:54] is the poster boy for that kind of
[13:57] movement you know which we see as
[13:59] normal human beings as being slightly
[14:02] degenerate and yeah I'm not really sure
[14:04] I want my teenage daughters to be
[14:07] exposed to that level of degeneracy well
[14:09] that's where fat land is now do you know
[14:12] what I mean it's funny how uh freedom of
[14:15] speech is really recognizable when you
[14:18] look at the artists when you look at
[14:19] comedians musicians and then you can
[14:22] actually see like what is this what is
[14:24] the status of of freedom of speech in in
[14:26] that particular country uh it's it's
[14:29] it's I never thought about that
[14:30] connection actually but it it makes a
[14:31] lot of sense yeah it's the death of art
[14:34] it's the death of art because much like
[14:36] the covid doctors not one of them wanted
[14:38] to speak out against the jab or anything
[14:40] because you know they've got a mortgage
[14:41] and they got family support or better
[14:43] not say anything you know this way we
[14:46] can have artists earn real money and
[14:49] really give a big middle finger up to
[14:52] the establishment yeah I think it's a
[14:53] weird one that people you know they kind
[14:56] kind of you know you get that kind of
[14:57] Silent phone call it turn them morning
[14:59] of somebody saying do you know what I
[15:01] mean if you want to go ahead you know
[15:03] everything will be dropped and it's you
[15:06] just think why why don't what you should
[15:09] there's a confidence in being able to do
[15:11] this like I've seen I've seen you know
[15:13] ain's exposed me to it's just a
[15:15] completely Fair way of doing something
[15:19] and I think that's what that's why I
[15:20] know we've jumped straight in by the way
[15:22] of like going straight down this road
[15:24] with it all but I don't know I just
[15:26] think it really needs to be said and
[15:27] really kind of like B home of people
[15:29] that this is happening it's not
[15:31] something that's like you know going to
[15:33] happen it's like it's happening so I
[15:35] think it's like it's it's just got to be
[15:37] said basically yeah so coming on your
[15:39] show it's like there's probably a lot of
[15:41] bitcoiners out there don't realize that
[15:43] these um platforms that are being built
[15:46] on top of
[15:48] Bitcoin they're going to take some
[15:50] shaking do you know what I mean and and
[15:51] it and it took Spotify and it took the
[15:53] record companies probably 20 years after
[15:56] Napster to capture the industry again do
[15:59] you know what I mean and all the record
[16:00] companies you say how does Fear affect
[16:03] it well the record companies pretty much
[16:04] own all the radio stations as well so
[16:07] how do you discover new genres of music
[16:09] how do you discover new music when it's
[16:12] the same formula like pop being played
[16:14] everywhere you know on the radio on TV
[16:17] adverts and all of those all of those um
[16:20] strings are they're all controlled by
[16:22] the centralized you know record
[16:25] companies were you before on a on a
[16:27] record label uh or how how did this or
[16:30] did you switch now completely to
[16:32] individual uh or being independent or
[16:35] were you always independent um I think
[16:38] secretly I've always wanted that but and
[16:40] also flirted with labels i' I've had
[16:44] deals in that but because of my
[16:49] intuition I've never committed fully to
[16:52] them because I'm just like wait what so
[16:54] you're getting that and you're getting
[16:57] that and I'm getting that and it's just
[16:59] like I don't see I don't understand why
[17:01] why why people would do business like
[17:03] that I don't understand it makes no
[17:05] sense because we should all win we can
[17:08] and we can all win so it's like that's
[17:11] what I don't get so yeah I think um
[17:14] it'll just be interesting to see what
[17:16] what comes out of it I'm sure we
[17:18] Lake we Lake will I don't know something
[17:22] will come of of I know they're obviously
[17:24] a um a distribution um company at the
[17:27] moment but it would be to see kind of
[17:29] what happens with with Bitcoin and
[17:31] record labels be so interesting it's got
[17:35] I think there's grow there's a lot of
[17:36] growth as well CU When we put longy on
[17:38] there probably this uh 18 months ago
[17:41] it's May 2023 I think we put our first
[17:44] track on there um there's probably only
[17:47] about 40 artists on there but now I
[17:49] think wav Lake themselves have just
[17:51] passed 1,000
[17:53] artists so 40 to a th000 that's that's
[17:57] probably 2x as well
[17:59] year a bit yeah so that's that's in a
[18:01] year so um yeah it's really about
[18:04] getting the message out these tools
[18:06] exist it's a toll you know it's like
[18:07] anything Bitcoin is a toll it's there to
[18:09] be used in whatever way you can kind of
[18:12] use it and the fact that people are
[18:14] confident to be building their entire
[18:16] music platforms on top of Bitcoin
[18:19] knowing that it's not going to
[18:21] necessarily go anywhere and the fact
[18:23] that you know wav Lake you know may be a
[18:27] a somewhere where you can host your
[18:29] stuff but you've also got the ability
[18:31] through apps like Fountain which is a
[18:33] podcast player where I can host music on
[18:37] my own website with my own server and
[18:40] share the index with Fountain and it
[18:43] will go and grab it from my server you
[18:45] know so there's that decentralization to
[18:47] music there as well how is that site
[18:50] called wave like or wave link W wav lake
[18:54] so w a v l a k e so you know you get WB
[18:59] files I imagine that's probably you know
[19:02] you get like a WAV file which is a sound
[19:04] file I imagine it's that and then Lake
[19:07] obviously having a lake of WB files yeah
[19:11] um but yeah for anyone listening um stop
[19:15] spending your money with with Spotify
[19:17] stop sending them 15 a month or 15 a
[19:20] month whatever it is because your
[19:22] favorite artists are getting probably
[19:25] 0.002% of that1 15 a month
[19:29] come over to the value verse come over
[19:31] to wav Lake download Fountain and check
[19:34] out some of the music there there you go
[19:36] that's that's the wav late one in fact
[19:37] that's one of longest tracks right there
[19:39] in the middle the the gray cover below
[19:42] wav late radio that one there that's one
[19:44] of his tracks there uh you can you can
[19:47] basically click that and you can listen
[19:48] to it for free you don't have to spend a
[19:50] penny you can listen to it for free you
[19:52] can download it for free but the term
[19:54] value for Value comes from I appreciate
[19:58] this I'm going to send some Bitcoin to
[20:01] the artist and and also send them a
[20:03] comment so love the tune I mean that's
[20:06] what you said you you liked about it
[20:08] yeah the fact that fans can can talk
[20:11] direct to the artists and you know
[20:14] engage with them which is kind of
[20:16] doesn't really exist anywhere else no it
[20:18] don't no not not on any other platform
[20:20] so yeah it's pretty pretty interesting
[20:22] that's really cool so it's uh also
[20:24] natively integrated with the lightning
[20:26] system you can directly uh send them SS
[20:29] uh with a message that that's re really
[20:32] cool and in Fountain has the same thing
[20:35] uh you said for for musicians also
[20:38] exactly the same so you know Fountain if
[20:41] you listen to podcast on Fountain uh
[20:43] they'll pay you a little bit of Bitcoin
[20:45] um fountaining have gone down the route
[20:46] so with wav Lake you would need to add
[20:50] some Satoshi to your wallet first before
[20:53] you can start sending people um Bitcoin
[20:56] uh but with Fountain if you listen to a
[20:58] few podcasts every day you know you can
[21:01] actually earn Bitcoin you can earn
[21:02] Satoshi through listening to podcasts
[21:05] and then you can reshare that value you
[21:07] know you can send that straight to an
[21:08] artist or straight to a
[21:10] podcaster um and send it send a message
[21:13] as well you know it's one of those one
[21:15] of those things where you can actually
[21:17] engage with the podcast and knowing
[21:19] they're going to see your comment or
[21:21] your remark I mean just type go on the
[21:23] fountain and going No Agenda you know
[21:25] it's the comments are full of people all
[21:27] engaging with the show and they're all
[21:29] sending you know sending their their
[21:31] value direct to the podcasters you know
[21:36] do you think that value for value system
[21:38] uh has I had a almost a heated
[21:41] discussion with with with bitcoiners on
[21:44] a Bitcoin Conference of uh setting
[21:48] prices versus being value for value and
[21:51] obviously uh it's not all the time
[21:53] possible like if you want to sell a
[21:56] hardware device I don't know if you can
[21:58] said uh just a random thing because you
[22:01] you have to pay for for the hardware
[22:03] device that that that you that you
[22:05] created so I don't know if if value for
[22:08] value is completely for everything but
[22:10] there are some people that say uh a lot
[22:13] of the future economic will be built on
[22:18] top of value for Value uh for for yeah
[22:22] every transactions for for people
[22:24] transacting to each other uh what or do
[22:27] you see it more on the the artists and
[22:29] the content creators and the the
[22:31] creative space can that actually come
[22:34] towards other
[22:35] Industries well I think like Michael
[22:37] sailor says you know if you're if you've
[22:39] got a business and you want to survive
[22:41] long term you're you're going to be
[22:43] doing whatever you can to try and get
[22:46] exposure to bitcoin to try and sell your
[22:49] services for Bitcoin because if you
[22:51] don't you're you know you're going to be
[22:54] left behind so the sun you know there's
[22:57] three ways to to get into Bitcoin you
[23:00] can earn Bitcoin you can mine Bitcoin
[23:04] you can exchange your electricity for
[23:06] Bitcoin by mining or you can exchange
[23:09] your dirty fat for Bitcoin and with
[23:13] these artists artists have got a much
[23:15] more pressing need for getting paid
[23:17] because um Bitcoin solves their problem
[23:20] of not basically being paid for their
[23:22] art um so if it does that for artists
[23:25] and it does it for independent content
[23:27] creators podcasters like yourself um uh
[23:32] I'm a hairdresser as well so I I charge
[23:35] I've got clients um that I charge
[23:37] Bitcoin for and it's it comes back to
[23:39] the basic economics of everything I buy
[23:42] using Bitcoin gets cheaper every year
[23:45] everything I buy using theat cost me
[23:48] more every year providing you spend and
[23:51] replace you know so if I spend 20 I mean
[23:54] I did last I bought some honey off a
[23:56] Bitcoin Bitcoin honey producer 20,000
[23:59] SATs as long as I replace that 20,000
[24:01] SATs I'm not going to have a Bitcoin
[24:03] Pizza moment you
[24:05] know I I think I think it also sorry but
[24:09] I think it also it actually makes you
[24:11] better as a person because it it it
[24:16] enables you to obviously zap and stuff
[24:19] like that but it's instantly like you
[24:22] know I don't know just go the long-term
[24:26] thinking like yeah it makes you it makes
[24:27] you it makes you be more aware of oh am
[24:30] I gen am I a generous person or or what
[24:33] do I feel you know like when we look at
[24:35] Art say a picture a bansy or anyone like
[24:40] should we be instantly it should be
[24:42] instantly Zapped like you should be
[24:43] instant like if you like it and and I
[24:46] think if it brings you pleasure yeah
[24:48] yeah completely and I think that's the
[24:49] bit that I'm like I just think it's such
[24:51] an amazing system to to kind of be in
[24:56] into and I think it suits music answer I
[24:59] think it suits music
[25:00] brilliantly and we have so much so many
[25:03] Trends coming together actually because
[25:05] I I think the internet was the first one
[25:08] where uh artists got um they had a a
[25:12] direct communication to their fans uh
[25:15] they all of the sudden could directly
[25:16] speak to them uh and there's no
[25:19] middleman in between and then we still
[25:21] had internet with that feat system and
[25:23] with that feed mentality so Bitcoin kind
[25:26] of forces that and uh direct
[25:28] communication with the internet uh being
[25:31] on on all the platforms on all the
[25:33] social media platforms and then on top
[25:35] of uh that with Bitcoin as the payment
[25:37] method uh is is really really good and
[25:40] then on top of that we we're moving more
[25:42] and more from the centralized uh social
[25:45] media platforms to decentralized social
[25:48] media platforms even though the trend is
[25:51] very early like there almost no people
[25:53] compared there's almost no people on
[25:56] Nostra compared to all the Facebooks and
[25:59] twitters and all all all the rest of it
[26:01] but in general it's just like a a force
[26:04] coming towards the individual rather
[26:07] than being some Label Company some
[26:10] agency some whatever in between which is
[26:13] I think really really cool and really
[26:16] really well we got you on nosta this
[26:18] week didn't we and and even though it's
[26:20] early on nosta um we get more engagement
[26:23] and we get more we get more engagement
[26:26] with everyone on Noster than we do on on
[26:27] Twitter because you know I love I love
[26:30] his bet you've had some beer in that
[26:32] that glass AR you I mean that's what's
[26:35] that point and off I don't have beer in
[26:37] there I always drink my water in there
[26:39] but there's supposed to be beer in there
[26:42] um but yeah you know we getting a lot of
[26:44] engagement on NOA you know much more
[26:47] than we get on Twitter than we get on
[26:49] Instagram in in some respects so even
[26:51] though you know you've not got millions
[26:52] and millions of people on there there's
[26:54] enough likeminded and that's the thing
[26:56] it's likeminded individual that you know
[26:59] which see for all the crap you know see
[27:02] for all the fat feat stuff it's a very
[27:05] high signal and very early group
[27:08] obviously I think uh if Nostra is
[27:12] successful in onboarding um a lot of
[27:14] people the the noise will also be in on
[27:17] Nostra similar to to to Twitter but
[27:20] right now it's a really cool place to to
[27:23] be as there's like a really early High
[27:26] signal group out there and it's really
[27:28] what what what made you adopt uh Nostra
[27:31] too like what what made you be on Nostra
[27:34] we were told to weren we well no I got
[27:37] on
[27:38] nosta is it it's probably about a year
[27:40] now isn't it was it launched about a
[27:42] year ago I think yeah cuz when when I
[27:44] was originally putting your tracks
[27:46] onto um wav Lake right in the beginning
[27:49] I think um I think I got onto Noster
[27:52] then but literally for the first six
[27:53] months I really didn't see didn't see
[27:56] much and it was a little bit slow but
[27:58] um but now it seems to built up quite a
[28:01] bit the apps have got better like I use
[28:03] amethyst um you're on damus I think you
[28:06] know so the apps have got a little bit
[28:07] better um but no it was hether really
[28:10] hether said that we should get on to
[28:12] nosta um because we should be investing
[28:16] some time in it because the engagement
[28:18] and like you say like um the signal is
[28:20] very high there so we got we got long on
[28:23] it last week um and you know I suppose
[28:27] no even removes removes another level of
[28:30] gatekeeping doesn't it because you can
[28:32] put a track on Noster and someone can
[28:34] zap you directly through nosta can't
[28:37] yeah I I almost feel a bit bad of of
[28:40] putting videos on YouTube and then
[28:41] putting YouTube on nosta do you
[28:44] understand that like actual official
[28:45] videos and things like that you feel you
[28:47] just think to yourself because if
[28:48] everyone's just seems to be getting
[28:50] behind you like on Noster and stuff like
[28:52] that they're like we're all running into
[28:53] the same thing but I think with with the
[28:56] F world it's a it's a hard cuz
[28:58] everyone's I don't know there's you just
[29:01] it's almost a bit untrustworthy when it
[29:03] comes down to like you just don't know
[29:05] you don't know whether you're getting
[29:07] enough traffic in there you don't really
[29:09] I just don't think you
[29:11] can the gauges are everywhere the gauges
[29:14] are they're [ __ ] basically so I think
[29:17] over where we are now man I love the
[29:21] fact that you can just see what
[29:22] everyone's you know I don't feel that
[29:25] it's just it just feels it feels alive I
[29:28] think it feels alive and it's not stale
[29:30] and it's like and there's a positivity I
[29:32] think behind it as well yeah definitely
[29:35] the the um the sentiment on nosta like
[29:38] you say it's high signal it doesn't you
[29:40] know like if I was to log on Twitter now
[29:43] it would be talking about all the same
[29:45] um talking points as what's been on you
[29:47] know BBC news today and you know if you
[29:51] understand that everything on BBC News
[29:53] is a lie and misinformation then why
[29:55] would you want to why would you want to
[29:57] even part take in that world of of
[30:00] people essentially just wasting their
[30:01] time getting bent out of shape for no
[30:04] reason you know why not go to Noster and
[30:06] say hey guys here's my thing over here
[30:09] where where people are actually kind of
[30:10] like crying out for it so so yeah it was
[30:12] he lson who told me to get longy on
[30:15] there and to spend some time uh you know
[30:19] showing him the way um and and yeah
[30:22] we're not not regretting it so far um
[30:24] yeah like I say Noster Noster is really
[30:26] cool and it's going to be it's going to
[30:27] be interesting see how it evolves next
[30:29] as well I partnered up with coin
[30:33] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[30:36] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw

[32:37] minute free call to find out how you can
[32:40] level up your
[32:42] sovereignty yeah it's uh I think most of
[32:45] the mainstream media is actually using
[32:48] Twitter as a primary source so like I
[32:51] don't know how it's in the UK but I saw
[32:54] I had yesterday discussion with fre
[32:56] Americans and they said that basically
[32:57] basically and in Austria it's also like
[32:59] that uh when when you're are going
[33:02] through like a week's worth of
[33:03] mainstream media it's almost impossible
[33:07] to get through there if uh without them
[33:09] noticing some tweets or something like
[33:11] that so they always go to Twitter to
[33:14] even find the sources so I feel like
[33:17] Twitter is like the the right now really
[33:21] good spot to find primary sources
[33:23] because a lot of people post their
[33:25] thoughts there first uh but I think in
[33:27] the longterm term people will tend
[33:30] towards Nostra and Nostra applications
[33:33] um for the primary source because I like
[33:36] just if I announce something I would
[33:38] announce it first on on Twitter then on
[33:41] Noster uh and and this would be kind of
[33:43] the the primary sources uh and I and I
[33:47] like that we tend towards more and more
[33:50] going direct to the source and not just
[33:53] having a news man reading down the news
[33:56] every week and it's kind of like it went
[33:58] through so many filters and it's like um
[34:02] someone says that and then you hear the
[34:06] explanation of that what he said on the
[34:08] news I just want to know what he said I
[34:11] just want to direct opinion isn't it it
[34:14] it's gone from it's gone from not
[34:16] reporting the news because the news used
[34:18] to be you know today four armed men U
[34:22] robbed a bank you know and it was
[34:24] factual now it like you say the s s is
[34:28] there and then it's passed through
[34:29] somebody else because you know most
[34:30] people's time preference is so short
[34:32] they don't have the time to sip through
[34:34] it all they literally get as deep as a
[34:37] headline and then by reading the
[34:39] headline they think they know the story
[34:41] and a lot of times headlines are
[34:43] deceiving you know they're not even
[34:45] correct uh I'm sure you know Donald
[34:48] Trump um you know Donald Trump's kind of
[34:51] like felt like that over the last few
[34:53] years you know what I mean every
[34:54] headline involving him has pretty much
[34:56] been been slighted against him and
[34:59] that's that's the same with anyone you
[35:01] know whether it's Julian Assange whether
[35:03] it's Ed Snowden you know mainstream
[35:05] media going to are going to put a slant
[35:07] a negative slant on those people um that
[35:11] you wouldn't necessarily get in in
[35:13] Twitter I mean at least Twitter is a
[35:15] place where you have got opinions from
[35:16] both sides of the fence going I know a
[35:19] lot of people are migrating over to Blue
[35:21] Sky and you know all these other
[35:24] platforms um you know even gab like Gab
[35:27] was one back in the day and on gab it's
[35:30] just rightwing content on Blue Sky it's
[35:32] just leftwing content and it's like yeah
[35:35] it's not it's not really healthy to be
[35:38] in a in an echo chamber like that I
[35:40] suppose when when telegram because
[35:42] obviously a lot of us went to Telegram
[35:43] in 2020 because of the whole covid thing
[35:47] um there was a lot of censorship on on
[35:48] Facebook and Instagram and stuff so a
[35:51] lot of people migrated to telegram but
[35:54] after um are you on Blue Sky are you no
[35:58] I'm not actually and never heard about
[36:00] it so I now I just typed it in to see
[36:03] what it is uh so uh I never never heard
[36:06] about it yeah so so a lot of a lot of
[36:09] people have been on Twitter you know
[36:12] announcing their uh resignation from
[36:16] Twitter if you like and saying oh i'
[36:18] I've had it with this place I'm going
[36:19] over here and and um I think the
[36:22] narrative is it's mainly for degenerates
[36:26] and um yeah but I think that I think a
[36:29] lot a lot you know go and open up a new
[36:32] Instagram page and then see what it
[36:33] gives you in your search uh column and
[36:36] it's always I've done this the other day
[36:39] um and literally it would show me stuff
[36:41] I was like I don't want this is not what
[36:43] I want to see this is not this is just
[36:45] shy that I don't know it just took me
[36:47] down a road where I was like this is so
[36:49] they've got it so wrong always trying to
[36:52] catch people out and stuff like that so
[36:54] I just think it's just going to don't
[36:56] know I mean I think it always be there
[36:58] but yeah I think those you know apps
[37:01] just people are just starting to make
[37:03] sense of of I think themselves a little
[37:06] bit more I would say probably yeah I
[37:08] think people have only just become aware
[37:10] of echo Chambers hav't they in the last
[37:12] couple of years and um yeah I mean have
[37:15] you ever been to a dinner party and had
[37:17] a had a discussion from someone on the
[37:19] other side they are absolutely convinced
[37:22] their narrative is is true and factual
[37:26] and there's you know you you can't
[37:28] generally have a conversation without
[37:30] someone losing their [ __ ] and and like I
[37:32] say I think all that is primed from
[37:33] mainstream media because that is their
[37:35] entire goal it's to get people worked up
[37:38] it's to get them you know scared I mean
[37:41] they're fear machines you know they're
[37:42] lme machines they're fear
[37:44] machines and when you're in Bitcoin land
[37:48] when you're in nosta when you're on wav
[37:51] Lake when you're listening to
[37:53] bitcoiners they're they're Fearless you
[37:55] know they don't have exposure to that
[37:57] you know we know where we're going we're
[37:58] all very optimistic very hopeful um and
[38:02] you know it's quite nice to to be right
[38:06] because look I mean the reason why
[38:08] bitcoin's
[38:10] $100,000 it's not because we're wrong is
[38:12] it do you know I mean it's not 100% And
[38:15] I think it comes down to I always think
[38:19] freedom is optionality if if you have
[38:22] the option to to choose between between
[38:25] things you can be on YouTube and Spotify
[38:28] uh but you can also be just on on
[38:30] Fountain and wave lake so like you have
[38:32] to option where where you want to be uh
[38:35] and so to to a large to a large degree
[38:39] we actually have um more and more
[38:42] freedom within the last couple of of
[38:44] years and even decades uh coming our way
[38:47] because of those platforms because we
[38:49] have those Outlets you can choose what
[38:52] you um consume think about like uh a few
[38:56] decades before that you you if you had
[38:59] to cover the if you want to be up toate
[39:01] you kind of had to go to the newspapers
[39:03] and the News agencies you didn't had
[39:06] those amazing tools you you can be on
[39:08] Twitter now you can be in Noster you can
[39:09] be on all those platforms and that
[39:12] freedom in itself is extremely Val
[39:14] valuable I think and something that we
[39:17] we GNA have to be aware of how how
[39:19] amazing that is that we we have that
[39:22] information uh always uh accessible uh
[39:26] for us on the flip side it's kind of
[39:29] it's too much sometimes for people
[39:31] people are too too much on on those
[39:33] platforms but I I think it's it's really
[39:35] positive that we have so much
[39:37] optionality these
[39:38] days yeah 100% I mean it is freedom of
[39:43] choice at the end of the day if you're
[39:44] quite happy in your little fear fearful
[39:47] Echo
[39:48] chamber uh then you know by all means um
[39:52] the whole point of Bitcoin is that it's
[39:54] a voluntary system you know no one's got
[39:56] gun to your head saying you know you
[39:57] must do this um and you know that's one
[40:01] of the the kind of founding principles
[40:03] of Bitcoin you know the fact that it's
[40:06] it's voluntary the fact that um it's
[40:10] Incorruptible um and it's something that
[40:13] we've never seen before and you know
[40:16] most mainstream people most normies as
[40:19] we call them you know those people that
[40:21] do still read newspapers those people
[40:23] that still um you know watch BBC news
[40:27] over here um they don't they're not
[40:32] they're not getting it yet they don't
[40:34] understand it yet um but I don't think
[40:36] they've I don't think they've been I
[40:37] don't think they realize what's actually
[40:40] why would you want to sit down at 6 o00
[40:43] every night and go wonder how many
[40:45] deaths there have been
[40:46] today I have no I have no time for that
[40:49] like i' like but that may be just me but
[40:52] I don't think it is cuz I'm pretty sure
[40:54] given a certain narrative you wouldn't
[40:56] want the negative one and and like I
[40:59] know it's incredibly sad that these that
[41:01] does happen in life but I don't want to
[41:02] be told about
[41:04] it I don't know what it's giving me
[41:07] absolutely 100% And I think I have maybe
[41:09] I have a good example to make the the
[41:11] point clearer um it's I I I like to be
[41:15] up to dat on what's going on with
[41:17] Austrian politics just to know uh if
[41:19] we're going in the right direction or
[41:21] wrong direction um so I have like a day
[41:24] sometimes I do it every day sometimes I
[41:25] do it once a week depending on on on on
[41:27] how how busy the the current schedule is
[41:30] but there's basically a Morning Show uh
[41:34] um uh midday show and the evening show
[41:37] in the Austrian mainstream news um and I
[41:41] like to skim through just the topics uh
[41:43] and I need like if you consume the whole
[41:46] shows you need around like one and a
[41:49] half hours one hour something like that
[41:51] uh and I get one day in in like three
[41:56] four minutes uh because most of it is
[41:59] like oh there was an accident on that
[42:02] autoban there was someone murdered and
[42:06] yeah maybe someone likes to know that
[42:08] but I don't like I I don't care what
[42:11] what happened in in some neighborhood um
[42:15] village where I don't know anyone uh
[42:18] what what happened there um I I would
[42:21] like to know where is the politics going
[42:24] because this is a decision-making thing
[42:25] of like should I stay or should should I
[42:27] leave maybe uh or how should I allocate
[42:30] my time uh so I only find like 5% maybe
[42:36] valuable so I usually skim through a
[42:39] whole week worth of news in like 20
[42:42] minutes uh and have all the things that
[42:45] I need uh unfortunately Austra is so
[42:47] small there are not a lot of content
[42:49] creators where this there's like a
[42:51] podcast format where I can have like
[42:54] once a week 20 minutes podcast that just
[42:56] gives me
[42:57] uh the most important stuff that
[42:58] happened uh I guess in the UK and uh in
[43:01] in America where where there's like a
[43:03] bigger thing that that's probably better
[43:06] um better offers for that uh but yeah
[43:09] it's it's doesn't make sense to report
[43:12] on those things but going back to what
[43:14] we were saying originally how Fe that
[43:16] fear sells you know do you think the
[43:19] news networks won't be reporting about
[43:21] you know climate change in you know
[43:23] Tanzania or whatever or or climate
[43:26] change in you know the
[43:28] Faulkland um I mean it's tenament child
[43:32] abuse but the fact of the matter is that
[43:34] that fear cells and that fear is what
[43:38] it's so emotionally powerful that it
[43:40] because it's going to make the
[43:42] viewer react to it this is why you don't
[43:46] see good news stories on on the news
[43:48] because no one's not F you know what I
[43:51] mean they're not they're not going to go
[43:53] oh that's really lovely that that
[43:54] person's now 100 years old and they've
[43:56] won the lottery or whatever they're not
[43:58] going to react to that but if there's a
[44:00] if there's a fear driven agenda and this
[44:03] is why value for Value we hope kills it
[44:06] because you know you're right there
[44:08] should be a news a News Network that's a
[44:11] very
[44:12] hyperlocal and if your news network is
[44:15] basically being funded with bitcoiners
[44:17] saying we want to know the news in our
[44:19] particular area then they're not going
[44:21] to need to do the fear-driven narratives
[44:23] in order to get the clicks onto the
[44:25] website to you know to get notoriety and
[44:28] to get the keep the sponsors happy you
[44:30] know because it's all about the sponsors
[44:33] I me you can see the podcast I mean look
[44:35] I mean I keep going back covid but I
[44:37] mean I think it opened a lot of eyes you
[44:40] know the our government in the UK was
[44:42] the biggest Advertiser they bought every
[44:45] single newspaper and every single
[44:47] newspaper front cover and back cover had
[44:51] you know fear on it and that was all
[44:54] paid for by the taxpayers so you've got
[44:55] the taxpayers
[44:57] literally funding the government funding
[45:01] Their
[45:02] Fear and you're just like I don't no I
[45:06] don't agree with this I don't I don't
[45:08] want you use my tax money on do you know
[45:10] what I mean fear
[45:12] propaganda um so yeah that's this is
[45:16] what we all hope and this is why the re
[45:18] this is the reason why we're doing this
[45:20] because the government can print up
[45:21] money extract it from the taxpayers do
[45:24] whatever they want with that money um
[45:28] despite what the taxpayer says because
[45:30] they've already done it up front they've
[45:31] already bought it and then and then and
[45:32] then when things when they've invested
[45:35] badly there's no accountability you know
[45:37] all those people that were in Parliament
[45:40] in 2020 to all voting for us to lock
[45:43] down all voting for mandatory mask
[45:45] mandatory mask um you know legislation
[45:49] they're all still in power I mean if you
[45:52] were that bad at your job if you were
[45:54] that incompetent you wouldn't still be
[45:57] in that job would you but how does that
[45:59] work in politics how does it how how is
[46:02] that possible like how do we let them
[46:04] off the
[46:06] hook I mean I I hope the accountability
[46:09] comes with with Bitcoin back I hope that
[46:13] actually changes do do you think um that
[46:16] Bitcoin has the power to to to change
[46:19] how governments are structured I I hope
[46:22] so I mean I know there was a couple of
[46:23] projects uh last year um where where
[46:27] they were trying to get voting on The
[46:28] blockchain you know they were trying to
[46:30] organize things like I think there is a
[46:32] way to do it because obviously you know
[46:35] there's more people vote in X Factor
[46:38] than that vote at The Ballot Box do you
[46:40] know what I mean at a general election
[46:41] so if they can do it via phones um you
[46:44] know there must be a proof of work
[46:47] driven why where everyone's vote can end
[46:51] up on a blockchain and all of those
[46:53] things such as let's send 22 ion pounds
[46:58] to Africa for a carbon capture scheme
[47:00] what we couldn't all log in or send a
[47:04] satosi to register our vote to say do
[47:07] you want 22 billion of taxpayers money
[47:10] sent to the other side of the world or
[47:13] to Ukraine to spend $3 billion do on on
[47:16] on Rockets because I'd be voting
[47:19] immediately yeah no thanks there is a
[47:22] project and I had him on the podcast um
[47:26] um where they are trying to do the
[47:29] verify elections using Bitcoin and they
[47:33] did that now with
[47:38] Guatemala uh and that's basically an
[47:41] article uh and I think here he he gets
[47:44] interviewed uh and that that's really
[47:47] interesting they do it with open time
[47:49] stamps uh and and putting on on bitcoin
[47:52] and I think a county in America
[47:57] is trying that out soon I think it was
[48:00] Georgia I could be wrong here I think
[48:02] Georgia uh the county in America is
[48:05] trying that next this is uh just to make
[48:11] elections uh more verifiable and more
[48:15] secure that you cannot tamper with them
[48:17] as much uh it doesn't really change a
[48:21] lot in terms of how government are
[48:23] structured but it already makes a big
[48:25] difference if if cannot be tampered with
[48:29] um and yeah of course like there there's
[48:31] has been a lot of debates like has been
[48:33] the the past election uh in in 2020 been
[48:37] tampered with yes or no I have no clue
[48:39] more or not in America but even if we
[48:43] have to ask a question and it's it's
[48:45] it's something we discussing that is
[48:48] already
[48:49] wrong it should not be a discussion
[48:51] point if the elections are tampered with
[48:54] or not that should be like of course
[48:55] they're not tampered with
[48:57] we we can trust that system yeah but
[49:00] it's still for me that still seems like
[49:01] a proof of stake model because yeah we
[49:04] can verify whether someone got
[49:06] elected um you know we can we can verify
[49:09] the election Integrity but we can't then
[49:13] verify the personality or the lobbyists
[49:16] or the funders of that said politician
[49:19] because uh Kia starma who's proving
[49:22] himself to be one of the most communist
[49:25] British politicians uh of all time um he
[49:29] has literally he was elected last year
[49:32] on the basis that nobody wanted to vote
[49:34] the other party so he got in by default
[49:37] he got one of the lowest vote shares of
[49:39] all time but he's got a pretty
[49:42] comprehensive mandate to do whatever he
[49:44] wants and you know their Manifesto their
[49:47] Manifesto was pretty much nothing they
[49:49] didn't say anything they were going to
[49:51] do like they didn't actually commit to
[49:53] saying we're going to do this we're
[49:54] going to do that all they committed who
[49:56] was saying we're not going to put taxes
[49:58] up we're not going to do this and within
[50:00] a 100 days they've gone against
[50:03] everything they've said so I think
[50:06] election Integrity yeah that's fine but
[50:08] how do you verify the politician that
[50:11] you've elected I think that's the first
[50:14] thing but then the second thing down the
[50:16] line I think it would be much more local
[50:18] it might even become you know as close
[50:20] as your local
[50:21] Council sending out a message vote on
[50:26] whether your bins are collected once or
[50:28] twice a week that's a real democracy not
[50:32] a cuz I remember during lockdown uh
[50:35] emailing my politician to say please
[50:38] when you go into Parliament can you vote
[50:40] against lockdown can you vote against
[50:42] mandatory Mass well this politician
[50:44] proved to me that he wasn't there
[50:46] working for me he just
[50:49] pared the government's point back to me
[50:53] do you know what I mean it was the wrong
[50:54] way round he proved in that moment he's
[50:57] not working for me he's working for you
[51:00] know the parasites at the top of the
[51:02] food chain over in Westminster so I
[51:05] think the blockchain or Bitcoin or
[51:08] whatever however it work if I could send
[51:10] one sat to register my vote on a local
[51:14] issue I think that's Downstream of it
[51:16] and I think then then you're living in a
[51:18] real democracy you
[51:20] know yeah it's also the question of like
[51:24] how they're funded and as long as they
[51:27] have the money printer um as long as
[51:29] they have the ability to just print
[51:31] money if they do mistakes and uh um I
[51:35] think not a lot will
[51:37] change uh and uh also the power of the
[51:40] money printer maybe they still have the
[51:42] money printer but Bitcoin is just like
[51:43] the dominant form of of of of the asset
[51:47] and if they print a little bit of money
[51:49] that will directly Skyrocket Bitcoin so
[51:52] they have accountability that way so I I
[51:55] just hope that Bitcoin will become that
[51:58] accountability for governments where
[52:01] when they are spending money um
[52:05] badly um they they will be punished for
[52:08] that uh in in in the
[52:12] Bitcoin purchasing power I would say and
[52:15] maybe it even takes away it's a whole
[52:17] debate in in Bitcoin but it maybe even
[52:19] takes away completely the Fe the fear
[52:21] money printer so maybe they completely
[52:24] are free of uh any possibilities of
[52:28] earning money through uh through the
[52:31] Fiat uh money printer and they rely on
[52:33] taxes this makes a huge difference
[52:36] because all of the sudden we have to pay
[52:37] for everything and we have to make make
[52:40] aware of of what we are paying for and
[52:43] then they have to say oh yeah we use
[52:45] that money for that and then the PO say
[52:48] like oh like why would we spend on that
[52:50] like that that doesn't make sense now if
[52:52] they want to spend on something that is
[52:54] not popular they just print the money
[52:56] for that that that's easy and people
[52:57] don't even know it yeah I love the idea
[53:00] that you know uh Bitcoin price is
[53:02] essentially a li barometer for
[53:05] governments you know the fact that the
[53:08] fact that bitcoin's gone up to
[53:11] $100,000 says that your government has
[53:14] been um should we say ineffective or
[53:18] inefficient let's say inefficient with
[53:20] spending and you know when the majority
[53:22] of these government jobs that are coming
[53:24] out are paid for
[53:27] um you know using tax payer like
[53:30] plundering the tax base and then our
[53:33] government here having a put taxes up
[53:35] even more to pay for more government
[53:37] bureaucracy and more positions you know
[53:40] bitcoin's price going up is is literally
[53:42] an indicator that your government is
[53:45] throwing your money down the
[53:47] toilet yeah it's it's it's it's a
[53:49] scoreboard of how bad fear and the
[53:52] government is doing right now 100% 100%
[53:55] that's how I like to look at it you know
[53:57] cuz if Bitcoin wouldn't have any value
[53:59] if we had a money that we could save in
[54:01] that kept its value and that wasn't you
[54:03] know deflated and print that's the one
[54:05] way to kill Bitcoin is make governments
[54:08] smaller and and make them spend within
[54:11] their means do you know what I mean we
[54:12] all know that will never happen a
[54:15] million
[54:16] years money PR go B no it' be
[54:19] interesting to see where this world goes
[54:20] though with it because it's I mean it
[54:23] literally is just it's you know it's
[54:25] exploding within it self and it so it's
[54:27] going to be really interesting to see I
[54:29] think in the next few years
[54:31] where you know even what El must done
[54:33] with Twitter when he went in and got
[54:35] half of you know rid of half of the
[54:37] people that were there oh yeah 90% I
[54:38] think he fired 90% of people and Twitter
[54:42] as an experience whether the content's
[54:44] got any better or not is debatable but
[54:46] certainly in terms of features um you
[54:49] know Twitter basically didn't change for
[54:51] about 10 years you know the features are
[54:53] exactly the same you know what I mean
[54:54] and since he came in he obviously
[54:56] created a few new features which you
[54:58] know pretty good but um but yeah that's
[55:01] what we need we need to get across the
[55:03] fact that we don't need the government
[55:05] interfering in every Min sh of our of
[55:08] our lives and you know through rock and
[55:11] roll that is one way we can get the
[55:14] message
[55:15] across almost in a um subconscious way
[55:21] um that yeah no this is not all right
[55:23] anymore do you know what I mean uh we've
[55:25] had enough and um you know if longy can
[55:28] express that through music and obviously
[55:33] be Fearless in what he's having to say
[55:36] uh with his
[55:37] lyrics um because you know he's not
[55:39] being throttled by YouTube or you know
[55:42] the algorithms um Bitcoin and the value
[55:46] forv value system will enable more
[55:49] people I think to sit up and take notice
[55:51] of what's going on on with Bitcoin do
[55:53] you know what I
[55:54] mean absolutely yeah I just Tred to
[55:56] figure out how much um Twitter actually
[55:59] fired and and it's over 80% yeah it's
[56:02] it's like they are now down from 8,000
[56:07] employees to a little bit over uh
[56:10] 1,000 uh and uh they they're looking at
[56:14] uh coming closer to 500 full-time
[56:17] Engineers so so he really like just get
[56:21] down the list and and SL it down
[56:24] guillotined them mate G well and and you
[56:27] know how about um just just remove 1% of
[56:31] government and see what happens I I it
[56:34] it makes me laugh with with government
[56:36] because every August I don't know if
[56:37] it's the same in Austria I can imagine
[56:39] it is because you know feat systems and
[56:41] all that but every August uh or July I
[56:44] think it coincides with the school
[56:47] holidays in the UK uh for about seven or
[56:50] eight weeks all the politicians they go
[56:52] on holiday like no one goes into hous of
[56:55] Parliament and you you know what
[56:57] everything works like everything
[57:00] works perfectly do you know what I mean
[57:02] they're not on on the front page of
[57:04] newspaper saying we're going to do this
[57:06] or you know we're going to support
[57:08] Ukraine we're going to put more wind
[57:10] turbine you know or bat Birds splicing
[57:13] crucifixes up in the country do you what
[57:15] I mean everything works for those six
[57:17] seven eight weeks where they all go on
[57:19] holiday you know yeah it's similar in
[57:22] Austria where the the the Summers a
[57:26] little bit calmer uh but there are
[57:29] Parliament like there are how are they
[57:32] called in English I have no clue but
[57:34] yeah those Parliament meetings going on
[57:36] the big ones uh and often we have
[57:39] actually elections in September so uh
[57:43] then from like July June August it it
[57:47] really starts to be busy again not with
[57:50] actual politics but with the election
[57:52] process and and they advertising for it
[57:55] uh and
[57:57] I feel like the smaller the country um
[58:00] the the closer the people are to the
[58:02] actual politicians and that's actually
[58:04] an advantage of being in a small country
[58:07] because the uh if you are the head of a
[58:10] country with uh 300 million people as in
[58:13] America that makes a difference you
[58:16] you're not as close to the people if
[58:18] there are just like 6 million people or
[58:20] 8 million people that's why El Salvador
[58:23] works that good because he actually
[58:24] knows what the people want like you
[58:27] don't know you have no clue what uh uh
[58:30] your country wants if there are like
[58:32] hundreds of millions of people but if
[58:34] that's just like on Tenth of the size
[58:37] you have a way better shot and in seeing
[58:40] what what the people like so uh some
[58:43] sometimes I feel like um smaller like
[58:47] the more Regional politicians get the
[58:51] the the better they they they become and
[58:53] the more Global they get the wor they
[58:56] get and the more uh superficial and the
[58:59] more uh just high level they are where
[59:02] they like like like he doesn't know what
[59:05] what what what uh politics actually are
[59:07] needed but that's just a subjective
[59:09] feeling I've not done any research on
[59:11] that yeah I think like I said I think I
[59:14] think Bitcoin does have the potential to
[59:17] remove a lot of that wastage from
[59:19] government simply from the point of view
[59:21] that um you've got a situation where um
[59:26] um things can be automated you know
[59:29] things can be done without you know it's
[59:33] that Mark Twain thing if if the person
[59:36] doesn't understand the problem then that
[59:38] person is part of the problem if
[59:39] someone's salary res relies on them not
[59:42] solving the problem then they are part
[59:44] of the problem that is essentially the
[59:46] polit politicians are just going to be
[59:49] voting for them to have pay Rises when
[59:51] they're obviously taxing everybody else
[59:53] in the country you know so it's it's you
[59:55] know it's two tier and and much and we
[59:58] see it everywhere we see two tier stuff
[60:01] everywhere and you know this is why we
[60:04] think music is is a kind of um it's a
[60:08] universal language that everyone is
[60:10] going to kind of get on board and if we
[60:12] can't if we can't Orange Peel enough
[60:15] people just by telling them that the
[60:17] system's broken and then they can see
[60:19] the system's broken because their taxes
[60:20] are going up and their savings are going
[60:23] well maybe we can reach them through
[60:24] this different pathway of music because
[60:27] maybe there's uh you know artists that
[60:30] they they they've not discovered yet uh
[60:33] that would open their eyes to it oh this
[60:34] is like you know it could be a bit
[60:36] gimmicky at the beginning oh I can
[60:38] actually send this out as a message say
[60:39] oh you know that song really means a lot
[60:41] to me and do you know what I mean I
[60:43] think if we can if we can kind of
[60:46] infiltrate people's mindscape through
[60:49] music and then that leads them to
[60:53] bitcoin then you know I think I think
[60:56] you know what what wav Lake and what
[60:57] Fountain are doing I think could be
[60:59] could end up being really powerful for
[61:01] the long term of of of everything you
[61:03] know of everything maybe I think he's
[61:05] you know breaking down the barriers of
[61:08] what we've been built to think that we
[61:10] should represent instead of actually
[61:12] what we feel we should represent in
[61:15] terms of our I don't think we ever
[61:16] listen to our intuition enough and
[61:18] that's why it's so easy to become again
[61:21] into a system of have your dinner sit
[61:24] down watch the news listen to is shy
[61:26] what read the paper more shy more
[61:28] negativity so I think he's just breaking
[61:30] down those barriers and I
[61:33] think I yeah I can't understand how this
[61:36] probably wasn't here years ago to be
[61:38] fair with Bitcoin you I mean like like
[61:41] literally in the 50s or 60s I can't it's
[61:44] it's just taking it's taking this amount
[61:46] of time to evolve basically well I think
[61:49] it it took 40 years to solve the double
[61:51] spend problem so that that's what was
[61:54] solved in 2008 so it l literally
[61:56] couldn't be built like people have built
[61:58] cryptography in the 70s and they' built
[62:01] all these different mechanisms which go
[62:03] into building Bitcoin but Satoshi was
[62:05] the guy that had that final blockchain
[62:09] was almost like the final solution to it
[62:11] uh and and the C the extra solution to
[62:14] that was him disappearing and being
[62:16] anonymous you know because if he' have
[62:17] made it under a corporation yeah the FBI
[62:20] turns up says shut everything down do
[62:22] you know what I mean so but you do feel
[62:24] slightly nausey being over here because
[62:27] it's almost like you're looking back at
[62:28] them going hello like we we're come come
[62:31] on over like this is this is Fairland
[62:34] yeah the the the um yeah the ocean's
[62:36] warm the Sea warm you know dip a toe in
[62:39] say say what you think yeah so yeah 100%
[62:44] there uh and I just wanted to know as
[62:47] you said from slimming down I think a
[62:48] lot of people trying to fix something
[62:50] that shouldn't be there in the in the
[62:52] first place they're just working on
[62:54] something that we we should replace at
[62:56] all um when we now think of all the
[62:59] things that we already covered in the
[63:01] podcast and where things are going is
[63:04] that a window into the future how how do
[63:06] you see that playing out in the next
[63:08] like 20 30 years uh with internet
[63:11] Bitcoin nostr decentralizing things
[63:14] maybe even in influencing how
[63:16] governments work uh what are you guys
[63:19] thinking of terms of like how how could
[63:21] that World um uh look like maybe also
[63:24] from the musician uh perspective how
[63:27] could that world look like in 20 30 50
[63:30] years whatever time frame you like to uh
[63:33] focus on if well if there's any of it
[63:36] left well this is this this yeah that's
[63:39] the thing with the theat world isn't it
[63:41] yeah because I feel like I feel like
[63:42] this is you know you'd be building yeah
[63:44] yeah 100% I think it's I think
[63:47] it's how will music change under a
[63:50] Bitcoin the language is already changing
[63:52] like my language will now change because
[63:54] of I feel that that that there's a
[63:56] system come into place where it's fair
[63:59] but also it's hard for an artist I think
[64:02] because also you're you're up against
[64:04] you the best songs come from from Pain
[64:06] and and hardships so so then come over
[64:10] to here my Lang he said this didn't you
[64:12] how will your language change talking
[64:15] about Bitcoin and it's not like I've
[64:17] I've got a lot of so talking about money
[64:19] but I suppose I thinking about it now
[64:20] I've got a few it will be interesting to
[64:22] see where how that how that looks for us
[64:26] because I know it sounds mad but I think
[64:29] as as humans we also we do we we have to
[64:34] have friction in our lives to be working
[64:36] up against something but I think it's I
[64:39] think we get lost in this like
[64:41] greed you know someone's got to have
[64:43] more than someone else and it's like
[64:45] well why is that then and they may work
[64:47] harder they may they may do more but I
[64:49] think when you're all sitting at the
[64:52] table and it's you know you're you're an
[64:54] aair a fair um kind
[64:58] of on a fair table then you're going to
[65:01] you're going to start thinking I just
[65:03] think it I think we we're trying to pull
[65:06] traits that have been have been
[65:09] Amplified over the years of not being
[65:12] very good and I think slowly what this
[65:15] does vtv system that was that will
[65:18] slowly just destroy destroy them traits
[65:21] yeah I mean I think how Bitcoin
[65:22] influences everything I can only talk
[65:24] from personal experience but for me it's
[65:26] a much more long-term Outlook you know I
[65:30] I eat better I sleep more do you know I
[65:33] mean I had more free time to be able to
[65:36] help people like longy you know bring
[65:38] his bring his music to the the the
[65:40] Bitcoin value verse um and I think it
[65:44] does like you can't change Bitcoin
[65:46] Bitcoin changes you and I think its
[65:48] Outlook um I think it's the fact that
[65:51] like I say you can now save for a rainy
[65:53] day and you you know that that Gra
[65:55] gratification of spending immediately
[65:58] you know buying a a new car all those
[66:01] kind of things you can kind of put to
[66:03] the back of your mind and think actually
[66:05] I don't I don't need that do you know
[66:06] what I mean um I can now save for my
[66:09] children's future knowing that I'm just
[66:11] a custodian of the Bitcoin I've got I'm
[66:13] just C because I'm gonna like it's going
[66:15] to be handed to them do you know what I
[66:16] mean eventually so I think it can have
[66:18] profound
[66:20] effects on everybody you know the fact
[66:22] that it will change longterm long low
[66:24] time preference it will change the food
[66:26] as well because at the end of the day if
[66:28] the money printer keeps funding and
[66:31] subsidizing all of these giant companies
[66:34] like it did during you know lockdown
[66:36] with you know shut gyms but keep
[66:38] McDonald's open do you know what I mean
[66:42] um I think people's people's mentality
[66:45] will change uh change for the better
[66:48] because they will be more caring they'll
[66:50] be more willing to look after themselves
[66:53] um they will be more aware of you know
[66:55] the the bad Pharmaceuticals and the
[66:58] danger of you know these big
[67:00] corporations and and the the the
[67:02] disgusting slop they're producing do you
[67:05] know what I mean so I think those
[67:06] companies that are already trying to get
[67:08] themselves on a f uh away from a fat
[67:10] standard or at least exposing them to a
[67:12] Bitcoin standard it's it's G to bitcoin
[67:16] will mean it Bitcoin will mean like what
[67:19] handmade used to mean back in the day
[67:22] you know something that's handmade
[67:24] there's quality there's love gone into
[67:26] that thing and I think someone accepting
[67:29] Bitcoin for their produce like whether
[67:31] it be a farmer with their beef um you
[67:33] know whether it be the local florist
[67:36] love is going to go into what they
[67:38] produce because their passion becomes
[67:41] meaningful and and I've said this before
[67:44] when your incentive and passion Collide
[67:47] amazing things happen and I think it's a
[67:50] positive for the the whole planet and
[67:51] like I say we're already here orange
[67:53] peeled we've seen it in our own lives
[67:55] we've seen it in our own P perspective
[67:58] Long's got a new lease of life after you
[68:00] know banging his head against the the
[68:02] fear music industry for 20 years it's
[68:06] like we I've just opened this little
[68:08] door and you know the the Pearly Gates
[68:11] of Heaven are kind of shining through
[68:13] this door and long is like what's this
[68:15] over here this this looks great and and
[68:17] within 12 months he's seen the value
[68:20] that his music has bought to people in
[68:23] in in the Bitcoin un
[68:26] and I think you're energized again you
[68:29] you want to get back in the studios
[68:31] writing more stuff so it's making him
[68:34] want to get more passionate about
[68:36] passionate about what he's doing and I
[68:38] think if we can get it out to as many
[68:40] people as possible I think everyone will
[68:42] take that into their lives going
[68:45] forwards that's an amazing Insight that
[68:48] Bitcoin is kind of incentivizing the
[68:51] artist to be an artist again and no no
[68:55] not uh being distracted with all the
[68:57] other things um as you went to to to um
[69:03] the value verse and the value for Value
[69:05] uh thing um what have you learned so far
[69:08] in in terms of if if someone listens to
[69:12] this and someone's an artist and he he
[69:14] isn't in that space what can he do what
[69:16] are some best practices where where to
[69:18] start with with all that uh do you have
[69:20] some some tips for potential artists
[69:22] that are
[69:23] listening just listen to this
[69:25] man yeah give me a shout give me a sh
[69:28] that simple mate um yeah so um I think
[69:33] for someone who you know um is pretty
[69:36] confident around a computer I think wav
[69:39] lake.com is the first Port of Call you
[69:41] know if you own all your own masters if
[69:44] you've never been signed by a label if
[69:46] you've got your own music and and we had
[69:49] a great story the other day didn't we
[69:50] about a guy whose father was in a band
[69:54] in the 60s and released loads of Music
[69:56] in the 60s he found his old album in the
[69:59] um in the Loft he's basically got his
[70:02] dad's album he's put that on on wav lake
[70:05] or LM beats and now his dad's music from
[70:07] the 60s he's now getting played again
[70:09] and he's getting earning Bitcoin from
[70:11] his from his proof of work from the
[70:13] 1960s do you know what I mean so so I'd
[70:16] say for the for the beginner for the for
[70:18] the newb um that is completely
[70:21] independent wants to do it all by
[70:23] themselves wav Lake provide a great
[70:25] service service you can go there it's
[70:27] very simple you sign up for an account
[70:29] um you can upload your mp3 uh you can
[70:32] create splits so if you're in a band
[70:34] with four people or I think they do up
[70:36] to 16 splits if you know you can
[70:39] basically upload your music you can put
[70:41] a value split in there split between the
[70:43] drummer the basist the singer you know
[70:45] the keyboardist you can split for every
[70:47] single member of the band all you need
[70:50] to begin with is a wallet you know a
[70:52] lightning wallet so you know you can get
[70:54] a wallet Satoshi or you can get Fountain
[70:58] download Fountain podcast they've got a
[71:00] wallet there as well I think that's
[71:02] where that's where ours goes that's
[71:03] where our splits go um but yeah wav lake
[71:07] is the easy option but there is more
[71:09] descent so wav Lake are some people will
[71:12] argue they're a decentralized service
[71:14] but essentially they're using the RSS
[71:17] index they're using the podcast index uh
[71:20] in order to grab you know they published
[71:24] to the RSS Pro basically your music so
[71:26] they will host it they will publish it
[71:30] uh and then you know they you know you
[71:32] can listen to your music and and and
[71:34] other apps because of what Bitcoin
[71:36] brings
[71:38] interoperability other apps even though
[71:40] you upload your track to wav lake
[71:42] Fountain will be able to find your track
[71:44] play it Len beats will be able to find
[71:46] your track play it curio cast the true
[71:49] fans all those other pod all those other
[71:52] podcast players will automatically be
[71:55] able to find your stuff once you upload
[71:58] it VI Wate yeah it may mean you have to
[72:00] do a little bit of work little more work
[72:02] but then on the flip side of that you
[72:04] still have to do all the work for the
[72:06] distribution over in fitland so it's
[72:08] like it's not it's you you are
[72:10] stretching yourself and I get that but
[72:12] that's the work also of an artist as
[72:14] well these days you know you've got to
[72:15] do you've got to be able to do
[72:16] everything yeah but if you're a bit more
[72:18] technical um and you can send and you've
[72:22] got your own website and you've got your
[72:23] own servers you can take your MP3s you
[72:26] can upload it to your own server um
[72:29] there's um Sovereign feeds um music side
[72:33] project.com uh you can put all the
[72:35] details into that site and it will
[72:38] generate you an XML file which you can
[72:40] then upload to your website that would
[72:43] on your behalf will publish it to the
[72:45] the podcast index or the RSS feed and
[72:49] it's as simple as that you know within
[72:51] two three minutes you can have your
[72:53] tracks online and people listening to it
[72:57] the other side of the planet do you know
[72:58] what I mean so so yeah they're my two
[73:01] things wav Lake if you're a beginner if
[73:03] you're a little bit more adventurous um
[73:05] LM beats um.com
[73:08] um not LM beats sorry Sovereign feeds
[73:11] music side project you know via
[73:14] uploading it to your own own website and
[73:17] and and servers so the um I'll talk a
[73:21] little bit about commissions so whereas
[73:24] Spotify PID something like 0 like 002 P
[73:29] per thousand streams or something like
[73:31] that uh wav Lake you'll get 90% And 10%
[73:35] go to wav Lake for obviously all the
[73:37] hosting and all of that if you was to
[73:40] upload via um music side project or or
[73:44] LM beats uh Sovereign feeds uh you can
[73:49] get 99% of the split and 1% will go to
[73:53] those those tools you've used so it
[73:56] really puts the power back into the
[73:59] musicians hands um when it comes to all
[74:02] of this stuff you know no more having to
[74:03] pay Distributors no more having to pay
[74:06] you know people to go and check this and
[74:09] that and the other you know those
[74:10] Spotify Gatekeepers um you you don't
[74:13] have to pay them anymore you can go
[74:14] basic
[74:16] direct direct peer-to-peer that that's
[74:18] how soosi Envision it I love it a lot
[74:22] really really cool perfect then we have
[74:24] one question question that I always ask
[74:26] uh my guest is what can we learn from
[74:29] you besides Bitcoin and maybe I add
[74:32] besides Bitcoin and music there is
[74:35] nothing for me no no it's pure music not
[74:38] in F
[74:40] land careful what you wish for come on
[74:43] you got so much wisdom in all those
[74:45] songs you all mate you've made you mean
[74:49] be careful what you wish for is a good
[74:50] one I like I like that I think it's true
[74:53] I think um
[74:56] yeah it's I just it's you it's it's
[75:00] literally just getting over it it's it's
[75:02] hard to um it's hard to it's hard to I
[75:05] don't because you don't want to push
[75:07] people do you ever you never want to
[75:08] push it like onto you Aaron done it in
[75:11] such a cool way with me so it's was like
[75:13] it was just um that was it was just kind
[75:16] of it's been a nice ride in if you know
[75:18] what I
[75:19] mean we're back there yeah what can they
[75:21] learn from us in fear I don't you know I
[75:24] just just
[75:25] ex oh
[75:27] um let's thing I mean yeah don't worry
[75:30] be happy just the future is going to be
[75:33] bright um just just you know keep
[75:37] pushing yourself to be better every
[75:39] every day um you know study
[75:44] Bitcoin um it'll make huge changes and
[75:47] like I say don't don't get too orange
[75:49] pilled that you go six months without
[75:50] eating properly do you know what I mean
[75:52] that's that's never going to be healthy
[75:54] but and yeah like longy says don't try
[75:56] and push it down other people's necks um
[75:59] I think you should look maybe I think
[76:00] you should maybe look at what you do
[76:02] daily of what you're putting into your
[76:04] system in terms of what you actually
[76:06] really you know what we're really
[76:07] gaining from the the what are we really
[76:09] gaining from the theat world in terms of
[76:11] growth that's what I think because I
[76:13] think over here it just seems that
[76:15] everyone I come into contact with there
[76:19] it's all about being fair and it's all
[76:21] about where how we both win instead of a
[76:23] fear world it's it's it's you you win I
[76:26] lose I lose you win it's just it's it's
[76:28] it's just a horrific
[76:30] system yeah I just just be vocal about
[76:34] it I suppose in your local network you
[76:36] know tell and show I think like tell
[76:39] them that there's this amazing stuff
[76:41] going on and you know show them show
[76:44] them something I think I think if you I
[76:46] think the keys to Orange peing someone
[76:48] is they have to see the magic so so you
[76:52] know I did it with my daughters I played
[76:54] U Monopoly but rather than using the
[76:56] Monopoly money we all add lightning
[76:57] wallets so whenever we would have to pay
[76:59] rent I would send them like lightning
[77:02] payments on Monopoly so try and make it
[77:04] fun um and don't go I mean there's so
[77:07] many layers to bitcoin don't um you know
[77:11] because I've got a Bitcoin Essex
[77:12] telegram group we got about 70 people
[77:15] I've tried to build a network um in my
[77:17] group of all of the self-employed people
[77:21] that are willing to accept Bitcoin for
[77:23] their work so I've got car printers
[77:25] plasterers on there musicians
[77:28] hairdressers like
[77:29] myself do what you can to try and earn
[77:32] Bitcoin you know turn your passion into
[77:34] something that you can utilize to sell
[77:37] to the real world because that's the
[77:39] only way we can really Master something
[77:42] if we're really passionate about it and
[77:44] um I'm really passionate about Bitcoin
[77:47] I'm really passionate about music and
[77:49] you know I want to try and get as many
[77:51] um artists onto um Bitcoin as possible
[77:56] perfect then for anybody listening if
[77:58] you know an artist just send him that
[78:00] that podcast episode I think that would
[78:01] be a great start really cool thank you
[78:03] so much uh you're both to be on we have
[78:05] an entertained podcast where the
[78:07] previous guest is asking a question uh
[78:10] for the for the next guest without
[78:11] knowing who the next guest actually is
[78:13] for the question for the both of you
[78:15] what is your goal with Bitcoin once
[78:18] Bitcoin succeeds in the capacity you
[78:21] think it will my go love it
[78:25] um it's get to America mate is it yeah
[78:29] 100% for next year yeah to see whe we
[78:30] can put it out the bag that'd be amazing
[78:34] uh the the Nashville is it Nashville
[78:36] Nashville Phoenix Arizona Texas yeah
[78:39] yeah yeah but they seem to be like they
[78:40] seem to be flying Flags over there for
[78:42] that didn't they yeah 100% a European
[78:44] tour I think yeah it's a it's a shared
[78:47] goal because I know with longy I know
[78:48] he'd want to take me with him but um we
[78:51] want you know Bitcoin to enable us to go
[78:54] and you know play at conferences I mean
[78:57] I don't know if there's an Austrian
[78:58] conference that you could put us in
[79:00] touch with but our goal I we've already
[79:03] realized that goal because it's like a
[79:04] self-improvement you know we we get
[79:06] better every day we doing what we're
[79:08] doing but I think in terms of like the
[79:10] kind of Freedom or the monetary aspect I
[79:13] think if Bitcoin went up a little bit
[79:14] more we would then be a to finance you
[79:18] know going to Europe um you know playing
[79:21] some gigs going to America I think
[79:23] that's our that's our dream minute
[79:25] that's our Dream if if Bitcoin goes how
[79:26] we think it's going to go
[79:28] 2025 we'll see a European tour from
[79:30] longy and hopefully us get into the
[79:32] states as
