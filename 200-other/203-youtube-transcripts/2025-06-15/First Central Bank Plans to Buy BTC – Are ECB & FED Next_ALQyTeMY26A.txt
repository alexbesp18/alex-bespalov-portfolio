[00:00] we are in an uptrend but this is a
[00:02] different uptrend than all the Cycles
[00:04] before because there are more and more
[00:05] people who are going to hold this for a
[00:07] long term instead of just trading it the
[00:09] cycle is completely different because of
[00:11] Institutions also we never had such a
[00:13] big portion of high Networth individuals
[00:16] big institutions and maybe even
[00:18] countries coming in this cycle and they
[00:20] have 100% a different buying power and
[00:24] also a different buying Behavior I do
[00:26] believe that it's inevitable that more
[00:28] and more people will use it because it's
[00:30] permissionless I'm curious which central
[00:32] banks are going to go in that direction
[00:34] they have their own check Kona which
[00:36] they want to protect of course for the
[00:38] future and this Central Bank Governor
[00:40] they're are aiming for a 5% of their
[00:42] total balance to go onto Bitcoin there's
[00:45] so much debt around that Bitcoin might
[00:47] be a solution for a transition every
[00:50] fiat currency has collapsed throughout
[00:51] history so it will collapse at some
[00:53] [Music]
[00:57] point how bad are you doing everything
[00:59] fine on your end yeah yeah perfect yes
[01:03] it's uh it's more busy than uh than last
[01:06] year so uh that's very positive yeah you
[01:09] you're seeing more demand for for what
[01:12] you're doing in Bitcoin uh because of
[01:14] the higher price or like how was it
[01:16] going with with what you yeah yeah I
[01:18] think I think I I don't I don't think
[01:20] it's just higher price actually that's
[01:22] an interesting question because it's
[01:24] it's also that mainstream media and that
[01:27] we see a different approach to
[01:30] uh Bitcoin from like the generic public
[01:33] I think that more people are starting to
[01:36] investigate it so what is the easiest
[01:38] for me to see is that it's in the book
[01:40] sales so we yeah we do the Dutch
[01:43] translations of the the famous Bitcoin
[01:45] books like the Bitcoin
[01:47] standard and that has a major uptick
[01:50] since like the end of last year and you
[01:53] see that there's like hundreds and
[01:55] hundreds of these Dutch translated books
[01:57] flying out of the door and that that
[01:59] means that a lot of people are taking
[02:01] the time to learn about Bitcoin study
[02:04] Bitcoin and that's that's super positive
[02:06] that's something that is that is also
[02:08] new for me so yeah I think the price is
[02:11] kind of the the one metric everyone can
[02:15] look at to see where everything else is
[02:18] going because obviously if um more books
[02:21] are sold more education is done more
[02:23] aded options coming more companies are
[02:24] coming more mining are on boarded like
[02:27] if everything is going up the the price
[02:29] will either lead or lag that like I
[02:31] don't know like what what's leading and
[02:33] laging lagging but the price is then
[02:35] kind of the obvious thing that is kind
[02:37] of a consequence of that because more
[02:39] people are buying in and more people are
[02:41] engaged in that so uh it's it's it's
[02:44] hard to what would you say is the best
[02:47] metric to capture the growth of the
[02:49] adoption of Bitcoin yeah for me
[02:52] personally then it's really like to see
[02:55] uh this with with books Etc so study
[02:59] studying but um I'm also the chairman of
[03:02] the United Bitcoin companies and we see
[03:04] a little bit of volume let's say with
[03:06] Dutch exchanges so uh the volume is also
[03:09] increasing a lot and that means that a
[03:11] lot of people are trading in out and in
[03:14] general this is during yeah these these
[03:18] very rapid uh movements of of Bitcoin
[03:21] and um we've had that for instance in
[03:24] the beginning of of last year also where
[03:26] we where we got a run up and then you
[03:29] see a lot a lot of volume coming through
[03:31] the exchanges and that has of course
[03:34] also happened around the inauguration so
[03:37] if if you look and then you're saying
[03:38] lacking or or front running I think in
[03:41] general like for me personally when I
[03:43] started to redive into
[03:45] Bitcoin uh when I really became like a
[03:48] maximalist or really believed in Bitcoin
[03:50] was like after quite a long time of
[03:53] studying so if you look at the books I
[03:56] read uh it's it's not like directly
[03:58] after the book it's like I've read a
[04:01] couple of books and then I took more
[04:03] time to investigate it and I would
[04:05] expect that that is the road for many
[04:07] people so if I see that there's now a
[04:09] lot of Book Sales I'm expecting like at
[04:12] the end of this year that more and more
[04:14] people start to understand that this is
[04:16] some
[04:17] critical thing that is not going away
[04:20] and uh that might also then uh yeah come
[04:25] back in in the volume that we will see
[04:27] then maybe at the end of this year let's
[04:28] say so I I I think we are in an uptrend
[04:32] but this is a different uptrend than all
[04:34] the Cycles before I believe because
[04:35] there are more and more people uh who
[04:38] are going to hold this for a long term
[04:40] instead of just trading
[04:42] it there there are many interesting uh
[04:45] things there like first of all I think
[04:48] that the cycle is completely different
[04:49] because of Institutions also I think we
[04:51] never had such a big portion of uh High
[04:56] Networth individuals uh big institutions
[04:59] and maybe even countries coming in this
[05:01] cycle um and they have 100% a different
[05:06] uh buying power and also a different
[05:09] buying behavior when you see micro
[05:12] strategy they're just buying like they
[05:13] they don't care if the price is dipping
[05:15] or not they're they're just buying
[05:17] regardless someone that just comes in
[05:20] and it's the first time there and
[05:21] they're just still educating like the
[05:23] retail uh uh money he might get shocked
[05:28] off by big swing they might sell a
[05:31] little bit if it's going too high maybe
[05:34] they actually also selling something if
[05:36] Bitcoin is going too high for micro
[05:38] strategy they're just issuing more bonds
[05:41] they're just buying more Bitcoin and
[05:42] using the additional buying bonds so
[05:44] like it's it's a whole whole different
[05:48] game I feel like since it's like one two
[05:50] years since ETFs and the big
[05:52] institutions coming in like it will be
[05:54] really fun to see what's what's happens
[05:56] the next few years yeah and then if you
[05:58] look at the I think it was the fat
[06:00] speech uh yesterday or something that
[06:03] was specifically about uh cryptocurrency
[06:06] and
[06:07] that we should like not like debank
[06:12] these companies uh we need this
[06:14] Innovation and like a totally different
[06:16] stance in comparison with what we saw
[06:18] last year and I don't know if you yeah
[06:19] you haven't seen it yet if I I haven't
[06:22] se I I haven't
[06:23] seen Powell's speech yesterday was was
[06:26] in that sense super interesting and if
[06:28] we look at what happened also in the
[06:30] Netherlands is that there was of course
[06:31] this operation choke point which rippled
[06:33] through through the entire Western World
[06:36] so it was not just the US it was also
[06:38] the Netherlands but it was also the UK
[06:41] and if you then look at uh how many um
[06:45] attempts there were to unbank exchanges
[06:49] to really make it difficult that that
[06:51] was that was really really really bad
[06:54] and and this was last year right so and
[06:57] now with all of a sudden this this
[06:59] itical change and then uh yeah Mr Powell
[07:03] saying something like which is basically
[07:06] the opposite of what we experienced last
[07:08] year that's like wow and banks are going
[07:11] to be able to also do something with
[07:13] this so that means that they're going to
[07:15] be able to uh offer crypto Services um
[07:19] in Europe or in the Netherlands it was
[07:22] at the moment I think only riute which
[07:24] was really doing this so yeah now the
[07:26] question is which banks are not going to
[07:28] do this because they will be left behind
[07:30] right because yeah all the young people
[07:32] are exposed in some kind of way and if I
[07:35] look internationally I think it's super
[07:38] interesting that also these larger Banks
[07:41] you can just put a little bit of Bitcoin
[07:44] there uh take a little loan out against
[07:47] your Bitcoin already so it's such a
[07:50] different approach from um from what
[07:53] we've seen in the past but still these
[07:56] products I think they're super risky H
[07:58] so uh
[08:00] most of the banks or most of the the the
[08:02] companies that have tried to do this in
[08:04] the past they have failed and then you
[08:07] everything is gone so your Bitcoin is
[08:09] gone too and we see now with segregation
[08:12] of funds uh regulation also that I think
[08:15] there is a much better uh possibility
[08:18] that these uh these options are going to
[08:22] uh to be there um but still yeah the
[08:25] best thing is of course not your keys
[08:27] not your coins and I expect uh that also
[08:30] to keep on growing and that's something
[08:31] that we see also 100% but it's just
[08:35] great to have the opportunity like if
[08:37] you actually want to borrow against the
[08:39] Bitcoin uh and you can May and I think
[08:43] that will be true at at some point uh I
[08:45] mean it's already there are some
[08:46] solutions that have that but where you
[08:48] can just prove that an address belongs
[08:51] to you just like you send just a message
[08:53] with that address to prove that you
[08:55] actually hold the keys to those Bitcoins
[08:58] and then you can borrow against the
[08:59] Bitcoin clients but always keep them in
[09:01] in your possession uh maybe at the
[09:03] higher rate or whatever I wouldn't see
[09:05] how that is going to work because that
[09:07] that if if you say it in that sense then
[09:09] it's going to be that you could do this
[09:11] with multiple institutions and then
[09:13] borrow against it multiple times that's
[09:15] like you you either put it in the
[09:17] possession of someone else and you can
[09:19] borrow against it or you have a full
[09:22] ownership yourself I don't really see
[09:25] any uh anything going to be in between
[09:29] easily let's say so um of course then
[09:32] they say yeah but if you move it or
[09:34] whatever but it's very difficult to see
[09:36] if there are other loans outstanding on
[09:38] a certain address which you have the key
[09:40] signatures for I would expect them to
[09:44] want to be able to hold the keys
[09:46] themselves so uh in that sense I'm I
[09:49] would be afraid to to take loans uh at
[09:53] at at companies that yeah don't really
[09:55] have the keys themselves because then
[09:57] they apparently they don't have own
[09:59] ownership of the Bitcoin where they are
[10:01] loaning against so that could be super
[10:03] risky so yeah that this is an
[10:06] interesting discussion anyway but uh
[10:08] yeah I I I just say that because I know
[10:11] uh um banks in in in Austria actually do
[10:15] that currently uh they do the same thing
[10:18] basically what what you can do with uh
[10:21] houses and they see Bitcoin as a
[10:22] commodity it might be very
[10:24] stupid but but uh as long as you can
[10:27] prove that you have the Bitcoin
[10:30] um you can take a loan out against a
[10:32] Bitcoin uh because they're still in the
[10:34] field system they're like they're still
[10:37] maybe they don't get Bitcoin to the
[10:38] extent of like the you can do that with
[10:41] multiple institutions you can do it
[10:43] online and something like that because
[10:45] we have a credit institution in Austria
[10:48] that overlooks exactly that problem that
[10:50] is there for like 150 160 years
[10:53] something like that probably there in in
[10:55] every country I know in Germany there
[10:57] are also things like that uh where you
[11:00] can go to a bank get a loan but and you
[11:02] can also go to other Banks and get a
[11:04] loan for basically nothing you don't
[11:06] have to show anything just like a a a a
[11:09] pay slip and you get a loan but there's
[11:12] a Institute above that in Austria it's
[11:15] called ksv Uh there are you also in
[11:18] Germany probably Netherlands many other
[11:21] ones and America is probably just a big
[11:24] credit rating organization um uh that
[11:28] kind of prevent that and and maybe they
[11:31] are they're feeling too secure in in
[11:34] that system that worked in the fat world
[11:36] but uh doesn't work in Bitcoin because
[11:38] it's a first asset that you cannot get
[11:41] out of someone's hand like if you have
[11:43] the same thing with a house they can
[11:45] come up with the police and say like oh
[11:47] like give us your house or or you get go
[11:51] to jail I I think these kind of things
[11:54] are are extremely risky from yeah this
[11:57] laner perspective if that's possible as
[11:59] you say it then you take out the maximum
[12:02] loan let's say you put in a lot of
[12:05] Bitcoin then you take out the maximum
[12:06] loan you buy more Bitcoin for it you
[12:09] take the plane to El Salvador and uh
[12:11] good luck you never pay anything back
[12:13] that's like okay I would I would if I
[12:17] would be the one that's loaning uh these
[12:19] people money just on proof of signature
[12:22] it would be rather crazy in my opinion
[12:24] but yeah interesting yeah that's that
[12:26] that's true yeah um I just wanted to
[12:28] show that uh uh because I didn't see the
[12:32] what Jerome actually said and I just
[12:34] noticed today in the morning that
[12:36] Bitcoin went up a little bit but uh
[12:38] doesn't it's usually not related to news
[12:42] uh but today it was actually like he
[12:44] said our role with Bitcoin really is to
[12:46] look at Banks and you know we think
[12:49] banks are perfectly able to serve crypto
[12:51] customers as long as they understand and
[12:53] can yeah like risks and blah blah blah
[12:56] uh so like uh that that's really
[12:58] interesting the banks can now do that I
[13:00] think that was sailor once had those
[13:03] free points of like the free points that
[13:05] have to be reached ETF uh um the this uh
[13:10] sap 21 or what
[13:13] called and exactly now this also like we
[13:16] kind of have all three points uh that
[13:18] was for him really important uh that
[13:20] Bitcoin adoptions uh is is growing in in
[13:24] America uh I think it I think this year
[13:27] will surprise even many Bitcoin Bulls
[13:30] what's possible but yeah that's that's
[13:33] just to my two sents what are you
[13:34] thinking what what uh the few next few
[13:37] years is possible for you yeah for me
[13:40] I'm I'm really focusing on self- custody
[13:42] right so because what I think is going
[13:44] to be interesting is that I believe
[13:46] still that there is a lot more Bitcoin
[13:48] going around uh on paper than there
[13:51] really is and this of course suppress
[13:54] the price still but uh it also um yeah
[13:58] is a Maj risk and the majority of people
[14:01] on this planet still don't know how to
[14:03] self custody they don't know that they
[14:06] can really take the Bitcoin into their
[14:08] own hands quite easily and I think
[14:11] that's a major Focus Point uh where we
[14:15] will also see and we also see that
[14:18] already it's becoming a lot easier and
[14:21] apart from that it's like um it has to
[14:24] be better and with top miniscript and
[14:27] currently like multi6 setups with with
[14:29] with time locks it's becoming really
[14:32] really really really great to hold your
[14:34] own Keys even for larger amounts of
[14:36] Bitcoin in a safe manner even seeing
[14:38] like uh Lloyds insured products coming
[14:42] on the market so you can even ensure
[14:44] yourself on your custody it's I think
[14:47] there's there's a lot going on in that
[14:49] space and that is super interesting to
[14:52] follow so um uh yeah and that's mostly
[14:57] out out outside of of of Europe in
[14:59] general I think uh currently but uh also
[15:03] if you see like we sell a lot of uh
[15:05] signing devices so uh all Bitcoin only
[15:09] air gap uh in general we also do bitbox
[15:13] but that's not air gaped but in general
[15:16] it's uh it's Bitcoin only and open
[15:19] source because those are the main
[15:21] pillars you have to uh to have to be
[15:23] able to trust the device and if you then
[15:26] look um at devices they are becoming
[15:30] easier to use
[15:32] and um they are also becoming a lot yeah
[15:36] a lot better let's say uh quality wise
[15:39] so I I I think we will see major steps
[15:42] forward in the upcoming years on this in
[15:45] this field and that means that it will
[15:47] become a lot easier for people to take
[15:49] self- custody and then I would expect
[15:52] also uh some sort of self- custody to
[15:56] start happening within the lightning
[15:59] Network so um if you look for instance
[16:03] at Phoenix wallet of course um it's so
[16:06] yeah you you you you have an self-
[16:09] custodial lightning solution let's say
[16:12] I'm expecting these kind of products to
[16:14] happen more in the future and then the
[16:19] place where people come in with Bitcoin
[16:21] will be directly on Lightning they will
[16:24] not be on uh they will not be on chain
[16:28] at the start and maybe if they dig in a
[16:30] lot further then they will probably move
[16:32] on chain and start to do some things
[16:35] there but in the basis I would expect
[16:37] that yeah within the next couple of
[16:39] years most people will start to dive in
[16:41] into lightning only and then will stay
[16:44] into lightning for a long time before
[16:47] they maybe step up into uh doing
[16:49] something on chain so yeah these are two
[16:52] things that I think that are really
[16:55] becoming important and going forward is
[16:57] also main focus where I would like to uh
[17:00] focus on also that that's super
[17:03] interesting uh we know like not everyone
[17:06] will have the luxury Bob berett made
[17:09] such an amazing um I think he was that
[17:12] on the podcast who made such an amazing
[17:13] comparison like we are blessed to drive
[17:16] in Rolls-Royce on the main layer like
[17:19] that's that's a privilege to to to have
[17:21] and that's kind of like um not everyone
[17:24] in the future will have that uh because
[17:27] we need to have Bitcoin the asset as
[17:30] secure as possible like that has to be
[17:32] this pristine asset that cannot be
[17:35] manipulated with maybe find some
[17:37] interesting solution that it opens up a
[17:39] little bit with not um um restricting
[17:43] the decentralization and the security
[17:45] aspect of it but lightning will become
[17:49] more and more mainstream or like maybe
[17:51] another layer two I don't know but I
[17:53] think lightning probably wins the race
[17:55] with the layer two adoption um before
[17:59] before we uh go into that I want to make
[18:02] one small step backwards with with self
[18:04] custody do you think self custody itself
[18:07] uh the concept will become mainstream I
[18:11] I I see so many bitcoiners still don't
[18:14] have self custody even though they are
[18:15] really educated on why Bitcoin they're
[18:18] really focused on bitcoin but they
[18:20] really steer away from having self-
[18:22] custody and and and the the how to
[18:24] secure
[18:25] Bitcoin yeah I I I think they are going
[18:28] to move toward self- custody because um
[18:32] it's simply longterm much
[18:35] cheaper
[18:37] uh and the products that are coming are
[18:40] so much better so let's for instance
[18:43] look at lyan with um a product where you
[18:49] have optionality in inheritance so then
[18:53] in actually you have like you hold your
[18:56] own Bitcoin but let's say your wife also
[19:00] has a key and then at some point if you
[19:03] die then automatically after some time
[19:06] the key of your wife actually has access
[19:08] to that Bitcoin which makes it super
[19:10] easy uh to have inheritance planning and
[19:14] I think this is the key aspect where a
[19:16] lot of bitcoiners are like yeah I I find
[19:19] it difficult because yeah if I die then
[19:22] uh yeah and I don't want to explain them
[19:25] now you know like this thing is like I
[19:27] think the major the major discussion
[19:31] Point I've seen throughout the years
[19:32] with bitcoiners and this is something
[19:35] that top miniscript with L for instance
[19:38] solves and uh time locking uh your key
[19:43] is is in that sense insanely beautiful
[19:46] because you just renew with a
[19:48] transaction let's say every year and as
[19:52] long as you're alive you will be doing
[19:53] that and then as soon as you die the
[19:56] next one will have the so it's fantastic
[20:00] and it's uh basically an almost zero
[20:03] cost
[20:05] solution and also like with tap rot it
[20:08] becomes relatively private so also there
[20:10] it's it's it's much better than it used
[20:13] to be in the past so I think yeah these
[20:16] these key problems that we see with
[20:18] bitcoiners are slowly being taken away
[20:21] and I'm expecting a lot of on that front
[20:24] yeah I love that we need more in
[20:27] Innovation on the on on self cussed as
[20:29] much as possible uh to make it as easy
[20:33] as POS because I feel like some people
[20:35] just have a lot of fears around it
[20:37] because they're not used to having
[20:39] actual self- custody they're like oh
[20:41] like what what if I I lose that device
[20:43] or what if I lose that uh that seed
[20:46] phase whatever lose that uh can I
[20:48] recover it and like yeah like but you
[20:50] have to make sure you can recover it
[20:52] like it it's not that you can call
[20:54] somewhere you have to make sure that you
[20:56] can recover it yourself like that's self
[20:59] custody that's like the self Sovereign
[21:01] way and people are not used to that like
[21:04] I think that's that's just a really New
[21:05] Concept that we have to educate the
[21:07] world on and but it's a great thing I I
[21:10] think the driving uh comparison is
[21:12] always really good so if you say can you
[21:14] drive a car and most people do have a
[21:17] driver's license and can drive a car and
[21:19] they learned how to drive a car come on
[21:23] to be honest it's not more difficult
[21:25] than learning how to drive a car I'm I'm
[21:27] I I I I think that's that's it's just
[21:31] like in in the in the minds of a lot of
[21:33] people it's it's made difficult uh I
[21:37] think also because of like how we
[21:39] discuss it and how it's put forward and
[21:42] there are indeed some devices that if
[21:45] you look at them then you think holy
[21:47]  this what kind of nerdy techy thing
[21:49] is this uh that is all going away in my
[21:53] opinion and it's going away quite
[21:55] rapidly and if you look I think there
[21:57] are currently
[21:59] in total yeah there are more than 10
[22:02] million devices roaming the planet at
[22:05] the
[22:06] moment um and let's say that most people
[22:09] own multiple devices so it's just a
[22:12] couple million people most likely that
[22:14] are are doing some self- custody some
[22:16] form of self- custody if that if that
[22:19] grows with just let's say like 1% of the
[22:22] world population and 8 billion people
[22:25] you know then it's insane what we're
[22:28] going to see
[22:29] and um I'm expecting that not all to be
[22:33] on chain as I said so I also expect that
[22:35] to be with lightning so I expect some
[22:39] kind of self- custody with lightning too
[22:41] because people need to become sovereign
[22:43] or self-sign in some kind of way and how
[22:46] that will look I I have no clue but I
[22:48] think that is going to happen at some
[22:49] point too absolutely um yeah it's a
[22:52] great point of like the UI and the ux of
[22:56] uh Bitcoin interfaces is not always the
[22:59] best but when you just look at the last
[23:02] five years what happened in the space
[23:04] it's amazing yeah like and then move
[23:05] forward to like the next five 10 years
[23:07] it it will be it will be massive and and
[23:11] yeah we need more designers ux and UI uh
[23:15] people in in Bitcoin to make everything
[23:17] look also really beautiful because I
[23:19] think we have a lot of people that work
[23:21] really great on on the backend side of
[23:23] things uh and yeah the UI and the ux
[23:25] access to be uh even
[23:29] as beautiful as as the
[23:32] backend yeah but it's also important
[23:35] that um we keep sovereignty alive you
[23:38] know like because it always comes with
[23:40] trade-offs so for the more technical
[23:42] people they should still be able to
[23:44] really um have full ownership and also
[23:47] full ownership over the of their data so
[23:51] uh for instance if you run a node you
[23:53] still want to be able to do everything
[23:55] through your own node that you're fully
[23:57] sovereign and that's of course for a
[24:00] small niche market but um this is I
[24:04] think very important because what you of
[24:06] course see is that some of these larger
[24:10] let's say uh yeah self custodial wallets
[24:14] they share data with the government you
[24:16] know they're public about it and yeah
[24:18] this is of course not uh the most
[24:21] Sovereign thing uh you could think of uh
[24:24] and then what happens if there is some
[24:26] crazy tax regime coming and some country
[24:29] where you coincidentally live with your
[24:31] family and your kids are in that school
[24:32] and you can't really leave uh then
[24:35] you're really so I I I'm I'm also
[24:38] quite skeptic about uh a two grade UI
[24:42] where all your data shared and I think
[24:44] that rabbit hole will also open up for a
[24:47] lot of people uh in the future and I
[24:50] think that's also very important
[24:52] because um you want to be able to move
[24:55] if you're not treated well and it looks
[24:56] like some governments are
[24:58] in different paths let's say uh so uh
[25:01] there's more freedom coming in some
[25:03] regions but it looks like they're really
[25:05] clamping down in other so and if that's
[25:07] the case yeah then you want to move with
[25:09] your feet right and then you need to
[25:11] have full Sovereign capability not be uh
[25:15] yeah let's say uh owned by the device
[25:18] you are working with and I think that's
[25:20] a very important thing it's it's super
[25:23] important to to to have that um how do
[25:25] you look at uh a scaling Bitcoin like uh
[25:28] for me Lightning is kind of the the most
[25:31] likely candidate for Layer Two then
[25:32] there's like fedt and ecash and all of
[25:34] all of the other since there's also
[25:36] liquid now that gets mentioned more and
[25:38] more uh how do you see the current
[25:41] development for for scaling Bitcoin
[25:44] above uh the main
[25:45] layer yeah so I think lightning has has
[25:48] proven itself already quite well if we
[25:50] look at my web shop uh last
[25:53] year I think I published the numbers but
[25:55] it was we had over 400
[25:59] lightning transactions it was um quite
[26:02] an amount of Bitcoin that that went
[26:04] through our web shop uh a lot of people
[26:06] pay with lightning and if you look
[26:08] indeed a couple of years ago when we
[26:09] started it was very difficult it was uh
[26:13] yeah it it had problems you know failing
[26:16] payments these kind of things but now it
[26:18] has progressed so much that yeah you
[26:22] keep your privacy uh we we are running
[26:25] for instance now also an Alby Hub uh as
[26:27] a sof custodial solution but um we use
[26:32] lightning checkout as a plugin on our on
[26:35] our website because lightning checkout
[26:37] has a very good node management and uh
[26:40] we didn't want to constantly also watch
[26:42] our node ourselves you know we have our
[26:44] own node with lightning but we link it
[26:48] to lightning checkout and they have for
[26:50] sure the best connection so everyone can
[26:52] easily pay with us and I think managing
[26:55] that is still not
[26:58] super easy and I think that also is
[27:02] going to be let's say more automated uh
[27:05] in the future um and when that happens
[27:10] uh in combination with some some kind of
[27:13] self custodial manner I think that that
[27:15] lightning will will will really really
[27:18] fly so um and and I think that's going
[27:21] to happen but it's it's just a question
[27:23] of time absolutely and as you mentioned
[27:26] uh just with with your shop on how
[27:29] quickly that went it kind of went goes
[27:31] back to what we already said earlier the
[27:34] adoption is going so fast in so many
[27:36] different aspects but because we are
[27:39] inside of of of that Bitcoin and we
[27:42] looking at like just a few months behind
[27:44] few months before we don't really see
[27:47] how fast we actually kind of moving I
[27:49] think we are already on a really steep
[27:51] uh adoption curve but we don't really
[27:54] see it yeah I I I think it's actually
[27:56] insane to see
[27:58] uh how little problems we now have
[28:01] indeed with lightning like in the
[28:02] beginning that was of course totally
[28:04] different and then now it's it's
[28:05] nonexistent so um yeah it it went from
[28:09] not stable at all to Super stable plus
[28:13] um yeah just seeing hundreds of people
[28:17] easily pay with it and preserving their
[28:19] privacy with it instead of using Fiat is
[28:22] just it's mind-blowing for me also
[28:24] because if you look at what we share and
[28:27] what we have to share if people use Fiat
[28:30] like PayPal is relatively big still in
[28:32] in Europe and every time a Paypal
[28:35] payment is being done all the data has
[28:36] to go to PayPal otherwise we don't get
[28:38] paid it's just insane you know like you
[28:40] have to share everything because they
[28:41] sell the
[28:43] data it's just that that's such a such a
[28:47] joke in that sense and people are not
[28:48] really aware of how this works right so
[28:51] I I would expect that when we digitize
[28:55] more and and cash is becoming more of a
[28:58] problem I think in the future then
[29:00] people will want to have some private
[29:02] spending and then the only proper
[29:04] private spending that you would have is
[29:05] on lightning so um yeah that's that's
[29:10] just not
[29:11] possible that we have that with Fiat so
[29:13] it's the only privacy preserving manner
[29:15] we have absolutely um do you do you
[29:18] foresee any any challenges coming uh for
[29:22] lightning for adoption anything that
[29:23] that you're currently looking at that
[29:25] that kind of has to be like overcome or
[29:27] overs solved
[29:28] yeah what what I would find interesting
[29:30] is that most people would go through
[29:32] like say Banks and then of course again
[29:35] these banks will will most likely also
[29:37] again fail like there will be many banks
[29:40] that will have problems there will be a
[29:42] lot of disasters again uh and that's
[29:45] what I would also expect to happen in
[29:47] the future because most people will not
[29:50] go through a self- custodial way they
[29:52] will go through like a third party so
[29:55] the largest uh lightning apps are are
[29:57] not self custodial so I would expect
[30:00] then some failures to happen again in
[30:03] the future but that's the path uh that
[30:07] we just uh walk on and uh I do believe
[30:11] that it's inevitable that more and more
[30:14] people will use it because it's
[30:15] permissionless and it's the only way
[30:17] that we can uh on board the planet like
[30:21] a lot of people don't have a passport so
[30:24] how do you want to get into a proper
[30:27] financial system uh and for the largest
[30:30] part of the planet uh they are in a bad
[30:33] financial system I personally think we
[30:36] are currently also in a bad financial
[30:38] system in Europe but that's a different
[30:40] discussion I I think the biggest threat
[30:43] also to lightning and uh to uh to
[30:47] Bitcoin in general would be a very
[30:49] conservative Central Bank where
[30:51] basically the payments are free so if if
[30:54] if money can start to flow freely uh
[30:58] with preservation of privacy and there
[31:00] there's not too much inflation because
[31:02] it's conservative monetary policy all of
[31:04] a sudden you have a competition with
[31:06] Bitcoin and that's the only competition
[31:08] I would see in the upcoming years and
[31:11] I'm curious which central banks uh are
[31:14] are going to go in that direction
[31:16] because currently they all live in
[31:18] parallel right so they inflate more and
[31:20] more uh with each other because uh they
[31:24] want their industry to uh perform but
[31:28] yeah if someone switches that into uh
[31:31] hard money standard then all of a sudden
[31:32] you get some competition from from that
[31:35] Central Bank I partnered up with coin
[31:39] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[31:42] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[31:44] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[31:47] love it so much coin vigilante made in
[31:50] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[31:53] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[31:56] show that you are a bitco coiner and
[31:58] that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[32:02] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[32:04] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:08] watch collections you have the date of
[32:10] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:14] there and of course also the block
[32:16] height and which EPO we are currently in
[32:19] I love the level of detail they put in
[32:22] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[32:25] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[32:27] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[32:30] love those watches so so much if you
[32:33] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[32:35] regular basis I guess you already bought
[32:38] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[32:41] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[32:44] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[32:46] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[32:48] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[32:51] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[32:53] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[32:56] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[33:00] with the code Robin at the checkout
[33:02] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[33:06] your bitbox and the next step is to
[33:08] really level up your sovereignty as an
[33:11] individual you have to have the most
[33:13] secure self- custody setup you have to
[33:16] secure your own devices you have to
[33:19] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:21] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:24] where you live you even want to have a
[33:26] plan B as it cens ship where you can
[33:28] move in case something goes really
[33:31] really wrong and through all those steps
[33:33] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[33:35] step by step and if you visit the
[33:38] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[33:42] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[33:45] out how you can level up your
[33:47] sovereignty absolutely it's it's um
[33:51] because we mentioned uh the EU and and
[33:54] the European uh space and at all it's
[33:58] it's kind of sad to see where all the
[34:01] news kind of break from from America and
[34:04] like even if you go on Twitter even if
[34:06] you go on on all those things like even
[34:08] if you go to German uh uh Bitcoin spaces
[34:13] uh a lot of the talks even about the the
[34:15] what's happening in America in Bitcoin
[34:19] because all the things that happen in
[34:20] the EU are on um a national level or on
[34:24] the EU level it's usually not that
[34:27] positive to to think about with the
[34:29] travel rule with with MAA and stuff like
[34:31] that um how how do you see you actually
[34:34] having a disadvantage to the US
[34:36] currently with with Bitcoin Game Theory
[34:39] uh and uh is there any point where you
[34:42] like you would leave the you or is there
[34:44] any point where like oh like I have a
[34:46] lot of Hope for still for Europe uh in
[34:49] in in terms of Bitcoin because
[34:50] Grassroots movement coming from up and
[34:52] it doesn't really matter what
[34:53] politicians are are doing now in the
[34:56] long term of course Bitcoin will prev
[34:58] but uh there can be a lot of pain in
[35:00] between right so and I think that's
[35:02] what's also going to happen so if you
[35:05] look at very simple the the the text
[35:07] Bill and the the the rules around
[35:10] doc8 is that all the data from all the
[35:13] exchanges has to be shared with the tax
[35:15] authorities and the European Union wants
[35:19] the member states to tax the tax Bitcoin
[35:25] uh additionally so they have two and a
[35:27] half billion extra income from Bitcoin
[35:30] so we all know that this is going to be
[35:33] in effect in in
[35:35] 2027 and that basically means that we
[35:38] would see major taxes on bitcoin let's
[35:42] say so and if you read through the lines
[35:45] of the let's say the ECB paper that was
[35:47] released lately where they said yeah
[35:50] Bitcoin could go to infinity and it's
[35:52] very important that
[35:54] everyone um has an opinion on that this
[35:57] is unfair right like this is the
[36:00] direction that politically it's already
[36:02] going you see this also in some of these
[36:05] weird comments online you know like the
[36:08] we are going to move into a narrative
[36:11] shift of yeah Bitcoin is something but
[36:15] it's unfair these people got very rich
[36:18] and it was very unfair so we have to
[36:19] text them to spread it uh among the
[36:22] people once again and that's what I'm
[36:24] expecting to see in Europe in the
[36:26] upcoming years when that happens I think
[36:29] a lot of people will
[36:31] leave um most of the people that I'm in
[36:36] touch with that have quite a good
[36:39] Bitcoin understanding and holding they
[36:41] have already
[36:43] left um because they know that this is
[36:46] not going in the right
[36:48] direction and the question is if this is
[36:51] going to be set out through the entire
[36:53] EU or if there will be some countries
[36:55] that will stand out and do differently
[36:57] because
[36:58] they might see a major influx of people
[37:00] fleeing there because they want to uh
[37:04] yeah of course live with with their
[37:05] Bitcoin and be able to save at least you
[37:07] know uh for the future so this is going
[37:11] to be interesting and uh that's what we
[37:13] will see in the upcoming two years yeah
[37:16] yeah I heard yesterday wait uh maybe I
[37:19] find it uh the the cck Central Bank head
[37:23] want to buy billions of Euros in Bitcoin
[37:27] I I heard that yesterday on on my feet
[37:29] everywhere and and I was not sure what
[37:31] it really is so I did not look into it
[37:33] maybe they're voting for it today so uh
[37:36] but that's a research to put it on the
[37:38] balance of the Central Bank in Czech
[37:39] Republic but what is already interesting
[37:42] is that Czech Republic of course removed
[37:45] all kinds of tax on bitcoin so they they
[37:48] already put a very clear stance that
[37:50] they are moving in a different direction
[37:52] than the rest of the European Union and
[37:54] the interesting thing is they still have
[37:56] an independent Central Bank right they
[37:57] are not in the Euro they have their own
[38:00] check Crona which they want to protect
[38:03] of course uh for the future and this
[38:05] Central Bank uh Governor there uh he has
[38:09] a Quantum uh investment background he's
[38:12] and he just is very plain and simple
[38:15] about this like if this is something
[38:17] outside of the current uh system we need
[38:20] to have it on the balance and they are
[38:22] aiming for a 5% of their total uh
[38:26] balance to go on the bit coin and they
[38:28] want to investigate it so the vote today
[38:31] will be about are they going to start an
[38:33] investigation to do this and yeah that's
[38:36] that's of course super interesting
[38:38] because yeah sorry go ahead yeah so more
[38:41] central banks are going to move in this
[38:42] direction of course because yeah we we
[38:45] all know that yeah these
[38:48] these currencies like the Euro or like
[38:52] the dollar have major
[38:55] issues uh not talking about the chines
[38:57] is youan even you know like and there's
[38:59] so much Deb around that Bitcoin might be
[39:05] a solution uh for a transition and I
[39:09] think that's what is signaling when you
[39:11] read this kind of news yeah I love that
[39:14] it's it's kind of because maybe maybe
[39:16] people outside of the EU are not as
[39:18] aware of that but EU is not one country
[39:20] like there's many different states that
[39:22] have many different tax laws and
[39:24] everything like it's it's just like one
[39:26] one room where everyone is is is within
[39:29] um there are some really dependences
[39:32] between the the states obviously uh but
[39:36] uh there are different tax rules there
[39:37] are different migration rules there are
[39:39] different whatever like there are many
[39:41] different rules uh so there are a lot
[39:44] of uh game theories in between the
[39:46] nation states going on of like who gets
[39:50] the people because I think Europe is an
[39:53] wonderful and really nice place to live
[39:55] like it's a really beautiful place to
[39:57] live no matter if you're in gratia
[39:59] Austria uh Netherlands uh France or
[40:03] Spain like they're really amazing to
[40:04] live and then it's like if you can move
[40:07] freely in the whole of the EU because as
[40:09] a EU citizens it's pretty easy to move
[40:11] around then you go there where it's
[40:13] where you're treated best so I think
[40:15] that's that might be the the the hopeful
[40:17] straw for for European citizens yeah and
[40:21] I I think that's also the direction
[40:22] where it it might head right so um there
[40:25] will be differences between these
[40:27] countries and that that will uh help a
[40:30] lot for settling let's say for a lot of
[40:33] people I I think that's that's going to
[40:34] move quite
[40:36] rapidly uh and we will see that unold uh
[40:40] when these new tax regulations
[40:41] specifically on on on bitcoin will come
[40:44] into place uh within the next yeah it's
[40:48] 2026 already all these exchanges have to
[40:51] start sharing data and then I think in
[40:54] 2007 27 we will really see what is going
[40:57] to to happen on that uh that part and
[40:59] it's it's very interesting because
[41:01] they're always talking about yeah it
[41:02] needs to be unilateral it needs to be
[41:04] unilateral but this is not going to
[41:06] happen you know like every country is
[41:07] going to do it in a different way and we
[41:09] even see that with mikar currently right
[41:12] uh the registrations of all these
[41:14] exchanges uh you can register wherever
[41:16] you want in Europe and of course every
[41:20] um every every country does it in a
[41:23] totally different way and yeah of course
[41:26] this will have impct
[41:28] and um that's also something that's
[41:30] going to be very interesting in in the
[41:32] upcoming year like in the Netherlands
[41:34] the first companies have already gone
[41:36] through this entire process of getting a
[41:38] license and the Dutch uh regulator is
[41:41] very very very yeah Progressive and very
[41:46] very much ahead of the the rest of the
[41:48] European Union and then yeah there are
[41:51] others where it's not even opened yet
[41:54] which is like completely insane if you
[41:57] look that in a couple of months like
[41:59] this mikar is in full effect and you
[42:01] can't deliver any services and some
[42:04] countries the process didn't even start
[42:05] you know like that's such a weird thing
[42:08] already where you see this this Europe
[42:10] is just like yeah it's it's so
[42:13] fragmented and then yeah I'm I'm very
[42:16] very
[42:18] curious uh how this will play out
[42:21] because yeah as I said the country
[42:24] that's going in the strongest or going
[42:25] in the most extreme with with tax
[42:28] measures they will lose a lot uh they
[42:31] will lose a lot of hardworking uh young
[42:33] people uh because if they they move too
[42:35] strongly against it they just move they
[42:38] don't
[42:39] care do do you do you think that the EU
[42:43] as an institution can hold in the
[42:46] current form as the UK left a couple of
[42:51] years ago already and uh the last EU
[42:53] election also kind of showed all the
[42:56] parties that EU critical really gained a
[43:00] lot of voting power do you see the the
[43:04] the the that kind of the EU citizens are
[43:06] a little bit uh pissed or annoyed at at
[43:10] the EU and that maybe that can lead to
[43:13] some some break of the EU or a different
[43:15] form or revolution of the EU like
[43:18] something in that direction you can
[43:21] see everywhere that people are fed up
[43:24] with overregulation right and now it's
[43:27] coming into effect in the US and then
[43:29] you see oh in the EU yeah we also
[43:31] need to do something and and uh it's
[43:34] very clear we might also get to see Euro
[43:37] bonds coming very soon so that's
[43:39] actually money creation
[43:41] within the EU where we get all of a
[43:44] sudden so there's going to be a lot of
[43:48] yeah strange struggles within the
[43:50] European Union and I'm very curious
[43:54] about yeah how how this is going to play
[43:57] out I I sincerely hope that more and
[44:00] more people grasp uh Bitcoin timely
[44:03] because I think it looks very very Bleak
[44:07] for for let's say the euro in this case
[44:10] and um even if you saw in the nland like
[44:13] lately in the media we've had uh
[44:16] messages from the Central Bank from the
[44:17] bankers Union from EV all kinds of news
[44:20] outlets on the front page like make sure
[44:22] you have cash at home because the
[44:25] banking system might have problems you
[44:26] know we are moving into like some kind
[44:28] of War Phase and uh they could be hacked
[44:33] and uh I'm also often sitting with the
[44:36] Dutch Central Bank and I brought some I
[44:38] actually wearing them now I brought
[44:40] these socks to the Dutch Central Bank so
[44:43] it's Bitcoin socks you know because
[44:45] there was on the major newspaper the the
[44:47] largest newspaper in the Nelons it said
[44:49] on the front page yeah make sure you
[44:51] have 50 in your sock uh because if the
[44:55] systems fail then you need need to have
[44:57] these 50 uh to to survive now I gave all
[45:01] these Central Bankers I gave them socks
[45:04] with uh I have that here wait one sec
[45:06] with with this because you can also have
[45:08] a sock with TW 12 or 24 words and I I I
[45:12] gave this little speech there you know
[45:14] like if you really want to be safe it's
[45:16] very nice that you put some paper in a
[45:19] sock but to actually have 12 or 24 words
[45:22] in the sock is far more valuable for the
[45:24] long term so you maybe should advise
[45:26] people to do that and they were of
[45:28] course laughing but I'm I'm really
[45:30] serious about this like if we look at
[45:33] War scenarios we've already seen that
[45:34] played out in Europe
[45:36] Ukraine uh long-term scenarios of
[45:39] systems that will be online as a
[45:42] monetary system it's only Bitcoin it's
[45:44] not going to be any other system and
[45:46] people forget that very often and um I
[45:50] think that's that's something that we
[45:52] really need to pick up we need to make
[45:54] sure that people get educated about this
[45:57] so we build better systems that actually
[45:59] can persist and in Europe uh everything
[46:02] is running on American software and
[46:05] Hardware so the entire Financial system
[46:07] and of course you know they have a have
[46:10] a button so I think Europe has something
[46:13] to do there and an open source protocol
[46:16] is in that sense uh available quite
[46:19] rapidly so
[46:21] uh interesting
[46:23] it's do you fear of a a complete Euro
[46:27] Euro like the currency Euro uh collapse
[46:31] when you see those those kind of
[46:33] movements eventually every fiat currency
[46:36] has collap collapsed throughout history
[46:38] so it will collapse at some point but we
[46:39] don't know when and it it could be
[46:43] decades hundreds you don't know but I I
[46:46] am not too positive about uh how it's
[46:51] going with uh the Euro because if you
[46:54] look how everything is is moving into a
[46:58] direction where they absolutely don't
[47:00] have a mandate for we still have high
[47:02] inflation over here people are losing
[47:05] trust very
[47:06] rapidly um we are like in the nland now
[47:11] this week also they are increasing the
[47:13] vat and uh like not cutting government
[47:16] spending no they they they increase the
[47:18] vat so everyone will be in pain again
[47:21] it's just like people are very very very
[47:25] uh Angry with their government
[47:27] already in Europe and I don't see a
[47:29] quick solution coming and the euro is is
[47:33] not the answer uh for for
[47:37] anyone it's super interesting because uh
[47:40] Austria is actually one of the worst
[47:41] countries in parts of inflation in in
[47:44] the EU Zone I think we like number two
[47:46] and number three in the whole of all of
[47:48] the 27 countries and we had I think we
[47:50] are number
[47:51] one you're number one and and also yeah
[47:53] we are at four point something still you
[47:55] know like 4.2% or something I don't know
[47:57] it's insan I try to find uh statistics
[48:00] because I always hear that that Austria
[48:02] is so so bad
[48:04] in it's yeah it's like Austria and the
[48:07] Netherlands yeah it's uh it's a pain
[48:09] yeah absolutely and it's super
[48:11] interesting because they spent so much
[48:13] money the last four or five years um and
[48:17] now actually there's a government shift
[48:20] uh and a party that never was in the
[48:22] government comes in and they really won
[48:24] the last election by far like a a really
[48:28] big Advantage uh and uh they want to now
[48:32] cut a lot of expenses and now you
[48:33] already hear the complaints of of people
[48:36] like oh like that bonus I don't get
[48:39] anymore we had a a climate bonus every
[48:43] uh year that you just get it's basically
[48:46] helicopter money for everyone and the
[48:49] further down uh you you live outside of
[48:53] uh uh of a public transport the more
[48:56] money you
[48:58] got made no sense at all uh so um and
[49:04] this is will will be cut there will be
[49:06] like many more things that they cut uh
[49:10] and it's it's a huge amount they have to
[49:12] safe otherwise they get a deficit um
[49:17] process of the EU where they are
[49:19] currently like five countries like I
[49:21] think Hungary Romania and like two three
[49:24] other countries like countries that you
[49:26] don't don't want to compare yourself
[49:28] within the EU uh in that regard and and
[49:31] now the government is cutting so much
[49:34] and people are complaining oh like I got
[49:35] that money before like like yet that's
[49:38] good like we we're getting a smaller
[49:39] government now they're trying to cut
[49:41] government spending and at the same time
[49:44] don't increase taxes I like that like
[49:46] they they they are uh saying we don't
[49:49] want to increase taxes we will not
[49:51] increase taxes but we have to uh balance
[49:55] the budget somehow so we have to cut the
[49:58] government spending so it's the first
[49:59] time since like five years I have a
[50:01] little hope for the government actually
[50:03] because they're like we have to cut
[50:06] spending uh and it's it's really
[50:08] fascinating and I hope I see that across
[50:10] Europe uh is more and more governments
[50:12] kind of wake up of like we cannot raise
[50:15] taxes at some point people will just
[50:16] leave like they they will abandon the
[50:19] the country yeah yeah and I I think for
[50:22] young people in that sense like if you
[50:25] are not really settled
[50:27] it's it's interesting where you want to
[50:29] settle yourselves you know like if we
[50:32] look at the the enormous debt burden
[50:35] that's laid upon you within the EU uh
[50:38] and then when Euro bonds come it will
[50:40] get even worse I I I find it very
[50:43] questionable where where this is all
[50:45] going to to go and yeah I I think a lot
[50:50] of people are already moving and more
[50:52] people will follow because of this so
[50:54] you need a major shift and that shift
[50:57] might happen but I don't see it happen
[50:59] very rapidly absolutely I'm uh I'm I'm
[51:02] I'm happy that my income is actually not
[51:05] depending on on Europe because that's
[51:07] another thing like you you can live in
[51:09] Europe and still get income from other
[51:11] countries which might uh make this a
[51:14] little bit safer but the best case is of
[51:16] course if collapse you're not even
[51:17] physically here um really really cool um
[51:21] we have one topic that we we discussed
[51:24] that we actually wanted to start with
[51:25] but want hour we needed to to get here
[51:28] and this is kind of open sourcing Mining
[51:30] and the the centralization risk of of
[51:33] Bitcoin mining um what are you doing in
[51:35] that regard and and and then what's the
[51:37] problem there yeah so um last year it
[51:42] was actually funny we have the node
[51:43] Runners group it's a big group in the
[51:44] Netherlands uh that runs nodes of course
[51:48] um some of these guys were really
[51:50] interested in having a bitx and I was
[51:52] like yeah bitx you know small minor or
[51:54] single chip minor what the are you
[51:56] talking about
[51:57] it's like such a waste of money because
[52:00] you just have a single chip and and no
[52:02] but it's open source and we want it and
[52:04] you can import this so you start
[52:06] importing this okay okay I I will I will
[52:09] buy a few and then I'll see what happens
[52:12] so I bought a few but that became a bit
[52:15] more than a few it became hundreds and
[52:17] hundreds of them and um and then when we
[52:21] discussed this further down the line it
[52:23] was like okay this is actually a
[52:25] movement where a lot of people are are
[52:26] going to thinker with the code they're
[52:28] going to thinker with mining they are
[52:29] going to have access to mining going to
[52:31] learn about mining they're going to join
[52:34] the biggest lottery on our planet
[52:36] because everyone is trying to hit the
[52:38] block and then if we all do that on
[52:41] basically almost uh zero cost basis at
[52:44] home because it uses only 15 watts of
[52:47] power it's nothing uh and you plug it in
[52:49] at every home we decentralize the
[52:51] network quite rapidly so then uh I
[52:54] started to really dive into this and
[52:57] then also the impact it could have on
[52:59] the broader mining because we install
[53:02] mining at businesses so we got famous
[53:05] because of the greenhouse with the
[53:06] Tulips a lot of people have seen that
[53:08] picture come by at at at X or Noster but
[53:13] uh we we do it at businesses and that's
[53:15] a bit larger scale so of course you
[53:17] cannot do that at
[53:18] home but uh we have quite some problems
[53:21] with this proprietary systems that are
[53:25] in these miners so can you imagine that
[53:28] within the next couple of years we
[53:30] develop it much more open we can
[53:32] actually steer the chips directly maybe
[53:35] even on DC so with solar for instance
[53:38] you can make the direct coupling with
[53:40] the chips so you get all the waste out
[53:43] we can do direct uh heating um on these
[53:47] chips uh much more efficiently we can
[53:50] start steering them much more direct so
[53:53] they can be used for um load balancing
[53:56] on the grid but for um yeah let's say
[54:01] smaller um smaller amounts of uh of of
[54:06] peak shaving and in a shorter time
[54:08] period that would also become super
[54:10] interesting so this movement could have
[54:14] a much more broader impact where a lot
[54:16] more people start to get interest build
[54:18] on this open source movement and then we
[54:21] could really
[54:22] decentralize uh decentralize the mining
[54:24] further out of the hand of the large
[54:27] corporations where it is currently and
[54:30] uh of course it needs to be at the
[54:33] locations where it makes sense so where
[54:35] there's need for heat where there's uh
[54:38] excess uh electricity available but um
[54:44] yeah it's it will be a competition with
[54:46] these Fiat loan based uh companies I
[54:49] think in the long term where we really
[54:52] have private Mining and open mining and
[54:56] as we currently see F2 pool has
[54:58] implemented the ofak compliance uh list
[55:01] so they are not mining some transactions
[55:04] this is where it's going to go you know
[55:06] there will be uh some of these pools
[55:09] that are going to be not mining certain
[55:12] stuff because the government says so and
[55:16] then as soon as taxes will start to come
[55:18] in also over this then I think these
[55:20] larger uh ones will start yeah to lose
[55:24] against the individual let's say
[55:27] and that's super interesting because
[55:29] when they kind of implement that uh and
[55:32] at the same time the individual and the
[55:35] private mining are getting more and more
[55:37] popular and they are rejecting basically
[55:41] transactions which then will be in the
[55:44] other ones more uh they they kind of
[55:46] lose out on the money the game theory is
[55:48] really interesting there how how this
[55:50] will will shake out in in in the future
[55:53] with with Bitcoin mining and I do think
[55:55] we need more open sourcing of of mining
[55:58] it it it kind of blew my mind I was not
[56:00] aware of that at all till like November
[56:03] last year like since a few months where
[56:05] some of the people came on the podcast
[56:07] and basically said like oh like we the
[56:09] mining pool centralization is is a
[56:11] problem the templates uh that they they
[56:14] use is a problem and then also like the
[56:16] the hardware is kind of a problem uh so
[56:19] we that Bitcoin is by far the most
[56:22] decentralized asset but we can we we can
[56:25] still get it F like we can still improve
[56:28] on the
[56:29] decentralization uh as aspect of it uh
[56:32] and yeah is how do you see it with with
[56:34] ocean and with the the pool
[56:36] centralization is is ocean kind of a a
[56:38] good solution or do we need even
[56:40] something more or something else there
[56:42] should be more solutions in the future
[56:44] but currently there is only uh let's say
[56:48] um ocean and also that's why we we
[56:51] started up a server in the centrer of
[56:53] the Netherlands datam server that we are
[56:55] running so we have a bit coin braon
[56:56] datam server where people can connect to
[56:59] um so if you want to mine a little bit
[57:02] and get some lightning out or you want
[57:04] to uh indeed mine with ocean but into a
[57:08] local server in Europe then uh I
[57:12] directly will say uh it's bit pool.
[57:15] Bitcoin bra.com and then double do
[57:18] 7331 so that's the stratum address where
[57:22] you can point it to and this is I think
[57:25] for for the moment the the best solution
[57:27] that we have uh and I think it's
[57:30] important that more and more people use
[57:31] it also because you actually get paid
[57:33] out more than with the other pools but
[57:36] uh it's also that uh we need to take it
[57:40] into our own hands and decentralize it
[57:43] because um yeah if these few pools are
[57:46] all being enforced to go into a certain
[57:49] direction then the network is not really
[57:52] free anymore so we need to take it into
[57:55] our own hands uh and I
[57:57] think when we see things like what is
[58:00] now happening with F2 pool uh it's
[58:03] inevitable that there will be more uh
[58:06] pools and uh it will decentralize more
[58:08] in the future I love that yeah we we we
[58:11] definitely have to move in in in that
[58:13] direction I hope we uh we can I think we
[58:17] we can really M make that happen do you
[58:20] have do you also think that or do you
[58:22] also encourage people to to start mining
[58:24] at home especially if they have have
[58:26] like some garage going on where they can
[58:28] put it there and not in their apartment
[58:30] and stuff like that in Europe only if
[58:32] you have excess electricity it might be
[58:35] interesting and if you can use the heat
[58:37] but in general in Europe we have the
[58:39] highest electricity prices on the planet
[58:41] so I I it's it's extremely hard the the
[58:46] few locations like this couple of dozens
[58:49] locations that we did it was very simple
[58:52] they had huge overc capacity of
[58:54] generation where they didn't get paid
[58:57] for so they had to shut down their uh
[58:59] solar then in the winter they had very
[59:02] inefficient expensive gas heat natural
[59:04] gas heating so they they could use the
[59:07] heat in in in the winter and then it
[59:11] makes sense with a relatively low
[59:13] electricity price on the business you
[59:15] know because it needs to be a business
[59:17] because if you're a private person it's
[59:19] far too expensive so in Europe in
[59:23] general it just doesn't make any sense
[59:25] so then of course I think it's
[59:27] interesting that
[59:29] people learn a bit just of course it's
[59:34] I'm selling these bit xes so I I I
[59:36] always find it difficult to sell to sell
[59:38] something but if you are interested in
[59:40] what mining is don't start with a big
[59:43] machine like I did just buy a bit X you
[59:45] know and then learn a bit about it what
[59:47] it is how it works but yeah don't Dive
[59:51] In To Go full berserk on a on a big
[59:54] machine if you are not far below 10
[59:57] cents a kilowatt hour because you will
[59:59] be ruined absolutely yeah it's it's
[60:01] super interesting uh because the big
[60:04] machine is also a way bigger investment
[60:07] in itself like if you buy it new it's a
[60:10] it's a massive but if even if you buy it
[60:12] um uh used it it's still a big big
[60:15] investment to start with yeah it was my
[60:18] P so in 2021 you know let let's say the
[60:21] peak of the last bull market uh I wanted
[60:24] to really learn everything about mining
[60:26] so I bought a miner uh for1 15,000 it
[60:29] was the most expensive most efficient
[60:32] Miner that existed on the planet it was
[60:33] an s19 J pro at that moment it was the
[60:36] best the best of you can get and I
[60:38] started to heat my house I got new
[60:39] electricity contracts buil boxes for it
[60:42] and then I had a a contract with where
[60:44] the electricity was super cheap and then
[60:47] on the 1 of January
[60:49] 2022 Russia and then boom my electricity
[60:52] price went like 10-fold so I was I I
[60:56] couldn't run the machine anymore it was
[60:57] just too expensive and I had a standing
[61:00] contract with the G natural gas so I was
[61:01] not in that much pain with heating with
[61:03] natural gas but electric electricity was
[61:05] just it was not possible anymore and
[61:08] then I hung it in a greenhouse and
[61:09] created this little video and that was
[61:11] watched half a million times and that's
[61:12] where the company came from you know
[61:14] like all of a sudden we got a lot of
[61:16] people said oh yeah I have a standing
[61:18] electricity contract with my business
[61:20] still cheap electricity but my gas price
[61:23] exploded so it it was exactly the
[61:25] opposite of what I had these businesses
[61:27] had and their return of investment at
[61:29] that moment was one year so they would
[61:31] just buy the machines we would install
[61:33] them they we would heat it with
[61:34] electricity and they would have the
[61:37] payback was one year at that moment so
[61:39] it was just so insane to do it that
[61:40] rapidly and that was 2022 and that's
[61:43] also when the business started so that
[61:46] that was a nice year for us to to run it
[61:48] but now when the electricity prices of
[61:50] course went up a bit uh natural gas
[61:53] prices are also still quite high but uh
[61:56] there are still some locations but not
[61:58] that many so you basically hang the
[62:01] miners in the the green houses and
[62:03] captured the the you reuse the heat of
[62:07] of the miners yeah I love that it's h
[62:11] someone told me about um project I think
[62:14] in Finland or somewhere where they have
[62:17] apartment buildings using Bitcoin miners
[62:20] with solar roofs uh and and
[62:23] basically um making the cost the
[62:26] electricity for their people in the
[62:28] apartment way cheaper with the with
[62:30] using the a large scale and especially
[62:33] in Finland it makes sense because if you
[62:34] have a very very low temperature uh
[62:38] which they have over there then um it's
[62:41] your efficiency for for uh air to water
[62:45] heat pumps is very low so then the
[62:47] efficiency of a miner which is oneon-one
[62:49] is is just fine and uh it makes sense
[62:53] over there and you see it I think almost
[62:55] 5% % of entire Finnish housing is now
[62:58] almost heated with with Bitcoin miners
[63:00] it's it ramped up very rapidly so tens
[63:03] of thousands of of of of livings we know
[63:06] of already have Bitcoin Heating in there
[63:09] and that went quite rapidly uh because
[63:12] it just economically makes sense and
[63:14] they have really cheap electricity in
[63:16] Finland so um yeah it's it's moving in
[63:20] these UPN North countries it's it's it's
[63:23] it makes sense to do it there is it
[63:27] is it at some point where Bitcoin mining
[63:30] is uh involved in so many different
[63:33] small devices for example heat reuse but
[63:36] if you want to heat something like there
[63:38] every small heater that is in in a house
[63:41] will move that or is it only possible
[63:43] when you have a country like Finland
[63:45] where it's cold and it would be
[63:47] otherwise very inefficient and then it
[63:49] makes economic sense or do you see a
[63:51] future where Bitcoin mining is kind of
[63:53] integrated in in more and more everyday
[63:56] devices like a heater I I think it it
[64:00] will happen at locations where it really
[64:01] makes sense uh so where there's exess
[64:05] electricity um in this case for instance
[64:07] also the excess methane so you have this
[64:10] drilling where
[64:11] methane uh is vented into the air uh so
[64:15] there's there's excess energy at a lot
[64:17] of locations and all these locations
[64:20] where there's excess electricity they
[64:22] will be tapped with Bitcoin for
[64:24] sure um and then next to that at some
[64:28] locations where indeed there is Need for
[64:32] heat in combination with that that that
[64:35] then that heat will be used but uh to
[64:38] see it in small devices uh for
[64:42] heating uh everywhere like no I I don't
[64:46] see that happen
[64:47] because um the machine becomes more
[64:51] complex H for heating uh which will
[64:54] incur cost
[64:56] and then uh if you look at how fast the
[65:01] machines are
[65:02] evolving uh it wouldn't be that wise to
[65:06] do that in in such a machine I think so
[65:09] yes for so let's say for instance in the
[65:11] Netherlands we have quite some excess
[65:13] solar uh you now have to pay the grid if
[65:16] you want to deliver electricity back on
[65:18] the grid okay you could put a small
[65:20] Miner there which then balances your own
[65:24] electricity use so you you use a bit of
[65:26] that electricity to mine Bitcoin uh you
[65:29] could use the heat uh that that could
[65:31] make sense but to have that in a
[65:33] specific different machine involved that
[65:35] has a SIM sing Single function which is
[65:38] critical I wouldn't see that happen I
[65:40] would always see it as a some kind of
[65:42] Standalone thing which is in of course a
[65:44] heater but uh in combination with smart
[65:47] steering but not uh not in any other way
[65:51] really cool I love that um we have one
[65:54] question that I asked each and every one
[65:55] of my my guests and the question is uh
[65:57] what can we learn from you besides
[66:00] Bitcoin what can we learn from me
[66:02] besides Bitcoin that's a good
[66:05] question
[66:07] um I I think what is important going
[66:11] forward for for us as bitcoiners because
[66:14] everyone who's watching this will be
[66:15] bitcoiners is going to be
[66:19] um we really have to uh look at uh sorry
[66:24] someone is coming in okay this is
[66:26] important that that that's maybe a nice
[66:28] uh nice thing there's some tea all of a
[66:30] sudden um take care of the people uh
[66:34] around you I think that's the most
[66:36] important thing and that's that's
[66:38] perfect with you getting a tea from
[66:40] people that care about you yeah yeah so
[66:42] so so what what what the interesting
[66:44] thing is if if we all take care of of
[66:46] our surroundings and the people then
[66:48] Bitcoin
[66:49] automatically will
[66:51] grow um and that's because if we all do
[66:56] good then the good comes back and I
[66:59] think that's that's something that we
[67:01] are often missing everyone is just
[67:02] working their ass off and stacking as
[67:04] much as they can because they know it's
[67:06] the right thing but if we are not also
[67:09] concentrated on our
[67:11] surroundings um and doing a step by step
[67:16] uh good over there which also maybe
[67:20] involves Bitcoin in some sort then uh we
[67:24] will not win the battle I I believe so
[67:27] yeah I think that's so yeah again I come
[67:29] back to bitcoin by the way it has to be
[67:30] outside of Bitcoin but just be good
[67:33] that's my my that's something I actually
[67:37] noticed with a lot of those answers It's
[67:38] like because I asked that in every every
[67:41] podcast and it's fascinating almost
[67:45] nobody uh does not mention Bitcoin in
[67:48] that answer like Bitcoin is usually
[67:50] mentioned in the answer what's besides
[67:52] Bitcoin somehow especially in the end of
[67:55] the
[67:56] it always goes back to bitcoin H it's
[67:58] super
[67:59] interesting to to see like oh like what
[68:02] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[68:04] and then like two minutes later Bitcoin
[68:06] Bitcoin Bitcoin yeah yeah yeah but yeah
[68:10] it's a good point like they taking care
[68:12] of of other people uh it's it's a really
[68:14] good point and I love that you just got
[68:16] the tea in that moment where you talked
[68:18] about that great yeah really cool um we
[68:22] have one endro in the podcast where our
[68:24] previous guest is asking a question for
[68:26] the next guest without knowing who the
[68:28] next guest actually is and your question
[68:30] from the previous guest is how will
[68:32] Bitcoin impact the Next
[68:35] Generation oh that's going to be so
[68:38] positive I I have children myself and um
[68:42] I I'm I'm so happy that uh Bitcoin is
[68:47] here because I I've I've always been
[68:50] quite an optimist in general uh
[68:52] technology- wise but not uh uh in
[68:56] politics or the status of where the
[68:58] world was going um
[69:01] because um money really makes the world
[69:05] sick H current form of money and um
[69:09] knowing that my children when they are
[69:12] like really going to be set free in the
[69:15] in the world so they they are really on
[69:17] their own feet and they can do whatever
[69:19] they want so that's in quite some years
[69:21] from now I'm expecting that we have a
[69:24] lot of beacons of Hope um based on
[69:28] bitcoin across the globe and these uh
[69:32] regions or these citadels or whatever we
[69:34] always call them they will they
[69:38] will grow so fast and it will be so
[69:41] positive and we will all think of how we
[69:44] are going
[69:45] to shape and build for the
[69:48] future
[69:50] um in such an interesting way that that
[69:53] I cannot imagine it yet uh but um it's
[69:58] yeah I'm I'm I'm I'm super super
[70:00] positive for the next Generations
[70:01] because hard money makes makes sure that
[70:06] um you're not afraid of the future
[70:08] anymore and I think currently almost
[70:09] everyone is afraid of the future and
[70:11] that's why you see such a sick world and
[70:14] uh yeah I'm looking forward to that
[70:16] point where we have more of these
[70:18] beacons popping up that's beautiful that
[70:22] that's lovely really cool thank you so
[70:23] much B for for taking time for being on
