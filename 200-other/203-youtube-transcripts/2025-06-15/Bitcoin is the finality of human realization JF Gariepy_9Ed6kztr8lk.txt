[00:00] this $5 invested today in a 100 years
[00:03] from now could be the equivalent of a
[00:05] million dollar you can store 24 words on
[00:07] a piece of metal right now and your
[00:10] great grandchildren might see you as the
[00:12] most Visionary men for having stored
[00:14] five bucks away for that Bitcoin isn't
[00:17] just a transactional tool that that's
[00:19] cool because you can send it by a butt
[00:21] on Reddit it's the finality of human
[00:24] realization and it is basically heaven
[00:27] on Earth the blockchain it is what
[00:29] matters there are massive existential
[00:31] danger if you start modifying yourself
[00:34] we have to stop we have to basically
[00:36] stop science now realize that the entire
[00:38] Fiat system is not your money even if
[00:41] you have the bills in your hands it's
[00:43] not your
[00:44] money you wrote a book about gen editing
[00:48] if I can say it like that so in a really
[00:50] simple terms and uh you also I think we
[00:53] got in contact because we wrote about
[00:56] Bitcoin on on Twitter uh and so it's
[01:00] interesting you bring up the dangers of
[01:02] editing genes uh and for me it's always
[01:07] like it's really dangerous to edit the
[01:08] money supply the fear money do you see
[01:12] there is like an an an connection
[01:15] between like stepping into nature and
[01:18] editing something
[01:19] artificially I think there is and it's
[01:22] the story of parasitic signals if we
[01:25] have a Channel of communication you and
[01:27] I and I'm sending you stuff you're
[01:30] receiving it there's a legitimate reason
[01:32] why this channel of communication exist
[01:35] and there's a reason why the human brain
[01:37] has evolved to process language but
[01:40] there are certain signals in which a
[01:42] third party shows itself in the middle
[01:45] and that happens to money and it happens
[01:48] to Eng thing it happens into whatever
[01:51] situation a third party benefits from
[01:54] messing up the the social signals or or
[01:56] whatever signals informational signals
[01:59] between two partners and these third
[02:02] parties they are really in the case of
[02:05] money they are the money printers they
[02:08] inject a false signal into the money
[02:10] supply money would be perfectly working
[02:14] if there wasn't anyone to printed and if
[02:17] all of these tokens that we have whether
[02:19] it's cash or either in bills or in
[02:23] currency if they were loose out there
[02:26] and no one was able to print them it
[02:28] would all work because there would be no
[02:30] place for a false signal but the false
[02:33] signal comes when you have the ability
[02:35] to print which systematically has
[02:37] happened to all monies in the world in
[02:39] the history of
[02:41] civilization I mean you also talked
[02:44] about uh before about Gene editing
[02:47] itself maybe um for people that don't
[02:50] know anything about it as
[02:53] myself what is genan editing and why is
[02:56] it
[02:57] dangerous so my book is the
[02:59] revolutionary phenotype the amazing
[03:02] story of how life begins and How It Ends
[03:06] um I was in Academia and I was looking
[03:09] at the state of evolution and our
[03:11] science of evolution and I was pretty
[03:14] satisfied I'm a biologist and I was
[03:16] looking at the work of Dawkins I was
[03:18] pretty satisfied that Richard Dawkins
[03:21] the selfish Gene explains how life forms
[03:24] evolve so it's natural selection you
[03:27] have certain certain members of a
[03:29] species are different they are slightly
[03:31] different and that difference makes them
[03:34] better better at making babies so they
[03:37] make more babies these babies inherit
[03:39] genetically the differences of their
[03:42] parents and that's how that's how you
[03:44] move in evolution from a bacteria to an
[03:47] elephant the bacteria got better a
[03:50] little bit in various ways eventually
[03:52] become a multicellular organism
[03:55] eventually some multicellular organism
[03:57] might compete the others and you get
[03:59] Lions you get elephants you get
[04:02] mooses uh so I was satisfied that uh the
[04:06] theory of evolution as laid out that way
[04:08] explains the vast majority of what we
[04:11] observe if not all um but then I started
[04:15] asking myself about Gene
[04:17] editing and what happens when life forms
[04:20] start artificially playing with their
[04:22] genes and I found things when I asked
[04:26] this question that were challenging that
[04:29] if if it happened in nature uh that that
[04:32] would challenge the view of The Selfish
[04:34] Gene of Richard Dawkins because once you
[04:37] have a life form that that attains a
[04:39] technological level that can uh afford
[04:43] to play with its own genes suddenly
[04:45] Darwin isn't quite what's happening
[04:47] suddenly you have a process of
[04:49] self-domestication
[04:50] and it's the process that Humanity has
[04:53] engaged in for the last few hundred
[04:55] years uh as it was slowly headed toward
[04:59] Gene manipulation of itself and at this
[05:03] point we don't know for sure whether
[05:05] we're doing it because there is a
[05:07] professor in China that has claimed to
[05:09] have done the first modification of
[05:11] human babies through genetic editing
[05:14] using crisper as a tool crisper is a
[05:17] molecular tool that comes onto your DNA
[05:20] removes the letter adds another one
[05:22] instead uh but whether we have done it
[05:25] or not we are very close to doing it so
[05:27] whether that Professor was honest and
[05:31] real or whether it was a fake doesn't
[05:33] really matter the fact is we have been
[05:36] constantly headed toward understanding
[05:38] our genome better and wanting to modify
[05:42] it better because the more you
[05:43] understand the human genome the more you
[05:46] have ideas about what you could fix if
[05:49] you don't know anything about DNA it
[05:52] might not be uh interesting for you to
[05:54] to to know that you could modify it but
[05:57] if you start knowing well this Gene will
[05:59] cause Alzheimer's later this Gene will
[06:02] give you Parkinson's disease in 60 years
[06:05] now you start being tempted at modifying
[06:07] the human genome and we we have a
[06:10] history of doing it on other plans for
[06:12] agriculture for improving our
[06:14] productivity we have a history of
[06:17] farming animals selecting their features
[06:20] making cows more fat pigs more fat so
[06:23] that they give more energy when they're
[06:25] farmed making uh plants more resistant
[06:29] to certain pesticides so we can spray
[06:32] them generously uh we've been doing
[06:35] these genetic modifications of
[06:36] everything around us but what my theory
[06:39] showed is that if you if you genetically
[06:43] modify yourself you enter a completely
[06:46] different evolutionary
[06:48] regime and this is important to
[06:51] understand we could have kept modifying
[06:53] the pigs modifying the chicken modifying
[06:56] the corn and it's not that dangerous now
[06:59] there are vegans there are you know
[07:01] these Organics people who are anti- GMO
[07:04] uh these people will tell you that it's
[07:07] dangerous and it's true there are small
[07:08] dangers to genetic modifications of
[07:11] other organisms but what the theory of
[07:13] fpic Revolution reveals is that there
[07:16] are massive existential danger if you
[07:19] start modifying yourself and in fact I
[07:22] claim that fpic revolutions have
[07:24] happened before on Earth they have
[07:27] happened 4 billion years years ago when
[07:30] the first DNA being came into existence
[07:34] it was through a phenotypic revolution
[07:37] so there has been a life form of this
[07:39] planet that has committed the exact same
[07:41] error that we're currently committing
[07:44] that has been tempted by the genetic
[07:46] modification of itself and they died and
[07:49] they left alive only the the RNA viruses
[07:52] of today and they gave birth to us I say
[07:55] let us not do what they did let us not
[07:59] beat them by self- modification to the
[08:01] point where we edit ourselves away from
[08:04] existence because this is what awaits a
[08:07] a species that gets engaged into Gene
[08:10] modification they enter an evolutionary
[08:12] regime that resembles the one that you
[08:14] see in uh ants and bees a regime where
[08:18] there is a queen and there are sterile
[08:21] workers now uh how do we get from Gene
[08:24] modification to a sterile workare system
[08:27] it's quite simple it's centralization
[08:30] if you C what the what the ants and bees
[08:33] have done is they have centralized the
[08:35] act of reproduction they're used to be
[08:38] their ancestors used to be free insects
[08:42] they were flying around finding a mate
[08:45] reproducing and that's it and their
[08:47] babies would in turn reproduce that's
[08:49] how Evolution Evolution Works
[08:52] generally what the bees and ants have
[08:55] done is they have centralized the
[08:57] genetic carrier what we call to their
[09:00] Queen they started entrusting a central
[09:02] entity to be that Queen carry the genes
[09:05] to the Next Generation and as a result
[09:08] the sterile workers genes started not to
[09:11] matter at all in fact they started not
[09:14] to matter as to how they make the
[09:16] sterile worker ant fit to live they
[09:19] started to make matter as to how they
[09:22] make the queen fit to reproduce and
[09:26] there therefore these thil worker ants
[09:28] have evolved in service to the queen uh
[09:32] when you centralize your genes you
[09:34] become a servant to the genetic interest
[09:37] of the central entity that edits your
[09:40] Gene um I would say there is a parallel
[09:43] to make with what we talked about with
[09:45] money uh when the economy is so
[09:48] influenced by a Fed that prints money
[09:51] everyone starts not being doing the
[09:54] things that they should do to make
[09:55] Society productive but instead they they
[09:58] evolve into a direction to please the
[10:02] FED to control who is on the FED to know
[10:05] in advance what the FED will do to bet
[10:07] on the market according to how the FED
[10:09] will inflate the stock market so
[10:12] suddenly you have an economy that
[10:13] instead of carrying at the bottom who we
[10:16] serve who do we sell to how do we make
[10:19] money they start caring to the top they
[10:21] start caring how do we serve the FED how
[10:24] do we align better with the fed's
[10:26] interest and that's the evolutionary
[10:28] situation in which a sterile ant finds
[10:31] itself the sterile ant cannot have
[10:33] babies and so it's only ways to ensure
[10:36] that there are copies of itself in the
[10:38] next generation is to save her Queen and
[10:42] now we enter in a phyp that's that's
[10:45] basically also what happens in a
[10:47] phenotypic revolution so if Humanity
[10:50] were to start editing their genes we
[10:53] would start having some Central entity
[10:56] an AI a computer that says hey I have a
[11:00] list of 10,000 genes here's how they
[11:02] should be if you want to be a happy
[11:05] human and you might say well that aren't
[11:07] there different ways to be a happy human
[11:09] oh yes here's a 100, ways in which you
[11:12] could be a very productive happy human
[11:15] which one do you want do you want 500 of
[11:18] these genes do you want this do you want
[11:20] to mix this with this do you want to be
[11:22] a super athlete or do you want to be a
[11:25] super high IQ scientist there are
[11:27] tradeoffs and the AI will always be the
[11:29] best tool for us to negotiate through
[11:33] these tradeoffs and say okay I don't
[11:35] want Parkinson's disease but if not
[11:38] having Parkinson's disease means I won't
[11:40] be an athlete then okay I'm fine with a
[11:42] little bit of chance of having
[11:44] Parkinson's disease But be sure to be an
[11:47] athlete so you're going to start having
[11:49] these Central decisions being made not
[11:52] So Much by humans but by AIS by
[11:55] computers because they will be
[11:57] impossible to handle for the human brain
[12:00] think about Computing what is The
[12:03] Ensemble of consequences from 10,000
[12:05] different genes in treat three different
[12:08] variants each uh or or maybe a 100
[12:11] different variants each all on every
[12:14] situation of your life it's impossible
[12:16] to process and eventually we will be
[12:19] delegating the process of choosing the
[12:23] best genes what are the best genes to a
[12:26] central entity now the day we do this I
[12:29] say we become a queen sterile worker
[12:33] Colony the day we do this it doesn't
[12:36] really matter how good you are of an
[12:38] individual for yourself it really
[12:40] matters how good of an individual you
[12:42] are for the central Queen and it's
[12:45] simply because when you start trusting a
[12:48] recipe for your jeans whether that
[12:50] recipe is written on some paper or
[12:53] whether it's written on a blockchain or
[12:55] or in an AI is a
[12:57] CPU that thing because the becomes the
[13:00] thing that evolves in the same way the
[13:02] the day the ster worker ants started
[13:04] trusting the Queen the queen started to
[13:08] evolve and the sterile worker and
[13:09] started to evolve with respect to the
[13:12] queen uh we will be evolving with
[13:15] respect to an AI if we start printing
[13:18] our genes and so my book and my theory I
[13:21] hope will make humans realize before we
[13:24] commit to that very dark path of
[13:26] becoming a slave entity to another uh
[13:29] another Central entity we have to stop
[13:32] we have to basically stop science now uh
[13:36] I know that we could explore science
[13:38] while also not exploring genetic
[13:41] modification but we should stop most of
[13:43] it and we should stop most of it knowing
[13:46] that the more we know about our own
[13:48] genes the more our descendants will be
[13:51] tempted to edit ourselves out of
[13:53] existence that is the message of my book
[13:56] and that is what I hope to bring to
[13:57] humanity we we must realize that of the
[14:01] millions of things we could have
[14:03] discovered this thing is the one we
[14:05] should not we should not want to
[14:07] discover it and we should close the Box
[14:10] close the Pandora box of genetic editing
[14:13] it's fascinating for me that um there
[14:16] can be technical advancement that are
[14:18] really good for um everyday um problems
[14:23] uh for like even if you take another the
[14:25] example of Bitcoin it's a technical
[14:27] advancement on Fiat
[14:30] was there before then was the fear tech
[14:33] technology advancement it was like maybe
[14:35] a step back and now we hopefully going a
[14:37] step forward but then there's also
[14:40] technical advancements that are really
[14:41] dangerous AI in itself can be really
[14:44] dangerous as you said when when AI comes
[14:48] then in contact with ch editing uh it
[14:52] becomes even more dangerous for that um
[14:54] so it's interesting to see how technical
[14:57] advancements can be good and bad and you
[15:00] also talked about uh that Bitcoin itself
[15:03] um was uh helping you survive an
[15:06] sensorship how did uh what was the story
[15:09] around
[15:10] that oh well uh Bitcoin has been
[15:13] centered to my life since
[15:16] 2015 because I've been giving up the
[15:19] Academia in 2015 and I had already been
[15:22] in contact with Bitcoin because I was a
[15:25] public science educator then and I was
[15:28] in the academ
[15:29] doing a postd at duuk University doing
[15:32] Monkey research I was I was re
[15:35] researching monkey brains and um and I
[15:39] wanted to give up the mainstream system
[15:42] because even before realizing that
[15:44] Bitcoin would be the key to my Exodus I
[15:48] realized that there was something sick
[15:49] in the system uh I got targeted by lots
[15:53] of uh hate lots of campaigns of hate
[15:56] lots of intelligence agencies
[15:59] um because I I decided when I went out
[16:02] of the University that I would be a free
[16:05] public speaker that I would be an
[16:07] intellectual engaging publicly and that
[16:09] I would touch upon uh you know
[16:12] controversial subjects like race and I
[16:14] would just say what I think about it
[16:16] which people can't do when they're at
[16:18] the employment of the Academia so first
[16:22] I was looking for liberty before I found
[16:24] Bitcoin but even then I was in somewhat
[16:27] in contact with Bitcoin because when I
[16:29] did a Q&A in 2013 or 14 uh people on
[16:34] Reddit started sending me butt tips of
[16:37] Bitcoin and back then they would send
[16:39] you like
[16:40] 0.1 Bitcoin or 0.05 Bitcoin and that
[16:45] would be worth then $5 $10 and I was
[16:48] like oh that's cool a a a machine of the
[16:51] internet for sending money that's very
[16:54] cool but I didn't think of it then as a
[16:59] as the center of my life in terms of
[17:01] acquiring wealth I didn't think I have
[17:03] to pour down all of my money in it but
[17:06] it was a cool functionality that was
[17:08] emerging then and that's how I saw it
[17:11] eventually all of my tips and people
[17:14] giving me gifts and donations I sold
[17:17] this Bitcoin for something like
[17:21] $120 in 2014
[17:25] 2015 bad decision but that's okay you
[17:29] know uh getting into the real Bitcoin
[17:32] cycle and understanding it takes a
[17:34] couple of bull runs and that that's fine
[17:37] but then I was I was also astonished by
[17:40] the fact that very early in my life
[17:42] before it became a meme to say it I
[17:45] realize that the entire Fiat system is
[17:48] not your money even if you have the
[17:51] bills in your hands it's not your money
[17:53] because there's a judge there who can
[17:56] attack you the way they attack Trump who
[17:58] can decide that your buildings are not
[18:00] your buildings there's your exes that
[18:03] can go at you and I I was starting to
[18:05] get a a series of exes that they they go
[18:08] at you because they want custody of the
[18:11] children and they start making false
[18:13] allegations against you then I started
[18:16] realizing and so the judge gives them
[18:18] custody even if the allegations are
[18:20] false and then I'm going to get drain my
[18:23] Fiat money to them forever because I'm
[18:26] going to have to pay child custody and
[18:28] alimony and that kind of stuff I didn't
[18:30] want any of this so very early in my
[18:33] life before I found that Bitcoin was the
[18:35] answer to all this I was like there is a
[18:38] sickness in the world uh you you can't
[18:40] live in areas that are too leftist you
[18:44] get these exes that are going after you
[18:46] they lie in court the judge believes
[18:48] them judges in Civil Court are
[18:51] unreliable they can go after your
[18:53] property they can drain your bank
[18:54] account basically I realize it's not
[18:57] worth it to even work in the traditional
[18:59] system because then I have to go back
[19:02] for a position at 30 40K a year where I
[19:05] barely survive or I'm getting drained by
[19:07] the apartment rent and all of this to to
[19:11] just look like I work and really that
[19:13] money I'm going to pay half of it in tax
[19:16] and then the rest will get drained by
[19:17] judges judges and exes so I was like no
[19:21] I I I might I decided basically it's
[19:25] better to be homeless than to work for
[19:27] this system of crap
[19:29] and the day I decided that I I actually
[19:31] never became homeless amazingly but I
[19:33] had decided in my mind if if homeless is
[19:37] the result of Liberty than homeless it
[19:39] is I've decided that I could live in the
[19:42] forest now that was a mind change that
[19:45] totally changed my life and that
[19:47] actually uh kind of paradoxically led me
[19:50] to acquire much more wealth that way
[19:52] because now I was centered about what
[19:54] matters which is I want to be close to
[19:57] my family I'm not going to accept jobs
[20:00] where I have to slave away most of my
[20:03] time of the day just to get to my job
[20:06] I'm not goingon to spend my spend my
[20:09] Mornings in traffic to get to a place
[20:12] because that's the place where they've
[20:13] decided to give me a job I'm doing none
[20:16] of this anymore I'm going to be a free
[20:18] thinker and and at that time I wasn't
[20:21] making money from my freethinking work
[20:23] so I I the book wasn't out my YouTube
[20:27] channel wasn't out yet and it wasn't uh
[20:30] monetized at least it was already active
[20:32] but not monetized and I said you know if
[20:36] that gives me zero dollars I still do
[20:38] this and I'll survive on eating grass if
[20:40] I need to uh but I'm not working for
[20:43] this system anymore and from here on out
[20:46] I'm only accepting work from home where
[20:49] I'm able to stay with my loved ones
[20:52] where I can concentrate on what matters
[20:55] and uh from there I started actually
[20:57] making more money than that way because
[20:59] then you're not you're not slave to the
[21:01] insurance system where you have to pay
[21:03] the insurance of your car so you have to
[21:06] go to work you have to pay all sorts of
[21:09] things just to be able to go to a brick
[21:11] and mortar facility to work and from
[21:14] that perspective I I started making more
[21:17] money and that money was mine and
[21:20] eventually it's in 20 from 2016 and 2018
[21:25] I realized that start first I started
[21:28] making a massive amount of money from
[21:30] the coming out of my book but that was
[21:32] in
[21:32] 2018 but I started making a lot of money
[21:35] also from YouTube because back then
[21:37] YouTube was free free free thinking uh
[21:41] in its perest form so it was the perfect
[21:43] place for a poist like me to show up and
[21:47] say some provocative stuff and things
[21:50] that basically civilization should have
[21:51] heard for decades but that it wasn't
[21:54] prepared to hear truths about
[21:57] controversial subjects about race about
[22:00] the state of America right now about the
[22:02] corruption of the current system so I I
[22:05] made a lot of money and then I started
[22:07] thinking okay how do I protect myself
[22:10] against everything because it's very
[22:12] easy to fall back into the system it's
[22:14] very easy to say I'm going to use that
[22:16] money to buy a house live my little
[22:19] regular life go to work to pay what's
[22:22] left of the morgage but I didn't want
[22:24] any of this I was like if if it worked
[22:27] if I got rewarded for calling out this
[22:30] system very early I need to uh flee this
[22:34] system with everything that worked as a
[22:37] trick and what worked to me is Exodus
[22:40] and I believe that what describes the
[22:42] current state of humanity with respect
[22:44] to bitcoin it's an exodus you have an
[22:47] exodus of all interest of all efforts to
[22:51] make
[22:52] money civilization the physical state of
[22:55] it has become so low and it's become so
[22:57] impossible to make money because oh
[23:00] you're going to develop a little
[23:01] innovative business of some kind that
[23:04] offers something interesting you're
[23:06] going to be stuck with the sludge of the
[23:08] state coming in asking that you overpay
[23:11] your employees saying you can't hire
[23:14] them on Monday the 20th because it's a
[23:18] holiday it's it's such a mess and you're
[23:20] going to have to pay a worker security
[23:23] and you're going to have to pay for
[23:25] their retirement eventually you're not
[23:27] going to make money selling uh you know
[23:30] burgers at $7 in this economy so I
[23:35] believe that what describes the what
[23:37] describes Bitcoin perfectly with its
[23:39] relationship to current humanity is
[23:42] there is an exodus an exodus of
[23:44] intelligence an exodus of desire for
[23:47] productivity and we call out a system
[23:50] that has made it impossible for us to do
[23:52] our work I can't go into Academia and
[23:55] beg the state for money to make monkey
[23:57] research and make the state of science
[24:00] Advance with this because I have to
[24:02] spend my my my days around red tape and
[24:05] asking for permissions and ethics
[24:07] committees I'm much better at home uh
[24:11] you know using 247 of my time
[24:13] concentrating on theoretical IDs I'm
[24:16] much more efficient that way than I
[24:18] would be under the state system which
[24:21] I've been very successful on up to 28
[24:23] years old I was always Gathering the
[24:26] best awards from the state for best
[24:28] scientific projects I was always within
[24:31] the top 100 of my nation in terms of
[24:34] soliciting funding and awards but I
[24:37] can't keep doing this first it's money
[24:39] that you've stolen to other people that
[24:41] you're paying me with they didn't want
[24:43] to pay these taxes for JF to be a
[24:47] scientist and second they're not even
[24:49] getting back from that money in the
[24:52] sense that I I'm taking that money from
[24:55] the state to be a
[24:56] scientist I'm and inflating my ego
[24:59] inflating my my capacity by
[25:01] accomplishing this technical realization
[25:04] in my super specialized field the
[25:07] reality is people are not getting back
[25:08] their money's worth it's a whole it's a
[25:11] whole expanding bureaucracy the the
[25:13] bureaucracy of Science and it's just
[25:16] because people are sympathetic towards
[25:18] science because yes you know there's a
[25:21] there's a handful of scientific
[25:22] discovery that have massively like by
[25:25] orders of magnitude improved the world
[25:27] but the reality is 99% of the scientists
[25:30] aren't these massive discoverers they
[25:33] they are doing the little technical
[25:35] stuff that will never serve
[25:37] you so I was like okay I need to get out
[25:40] of this system and between 2016 and 2018
[25:44] I realized starting to listen to the
[25:46] Bitcoin propaganda although I was super
[25:49] sympathetic to bitcoin already I start
[25:52] convincing myself and I start realizing
[25:54] Bitcoin isn't just a transactional tool
[25:57] that cool because you can send it by a
[26:00] butt on Reddit it's it's the finality of
[26:05] human realization and it it is basically
[26:08] heaven on Earth the blockchain it is
[26:11] what matters and so that's where I
[26:13] started saying all of my money which I
[26:15] got I got very lucky to be at a time
[26:18] where YouTube would let you speak free
[26:20] that is a time of civilization that
[26:22] lasted about two or three years that we
[26:24] could do free live streams with free
[26:27] thought I'm starting to be a censored
[26:30] there so it's the same thing that I
[26:31] faced in Normie world you know these
[26:34] judges these ex's false allegations
[26:37] mainstream media coming after me and
[26:39] repeating those false allegation that
[26:41] were false when my exes did it and I'm
[26:44] like okay I got money luckily from this
[26:47] system for basically a year of Fame on
[26:50] YouTube I'm going to take all that money
[26:52] I'm putting in putting it in Bitcoin and
[26:55] this will give me freedom and freedom
[26:57] for my d Sundance and since then it's
[27:00] been up up
[27:02] up in fact I've huddled through bull
[27:05] runs at this point uh for example the uh
[27:08] the last Bull Run I was expecting that
[27:09] it would go to 100K 120k I was looking
[27:13] at it at 60k I was like I'm not selling
[27:16] and I held to that the Bitcoin I have
[27:18] today is still Bitcoin that I had four
[27:20] years ago so now we're seeing the
[27:23] alltime H the alltime high coming back
[27:26] and I'm very happy about it uh because
[27:29] now I'm a crossb run huddler I'm super
[27:32] excited to announce that this podcast
[27:35] got the first ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is
[27:39] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[27:42] and preach self custody this is my goto
[27:46] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[27:48] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[27:50] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[27:54] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[27:56] support this podcast use code Robin and
[27:59] click the link in the description very
[28:01] good yeah and it's it's a great
[28:03] accomplishment to have more bull runs in
[28:07] the loop I I think I started around 2020
[28:10] and I did not sold a single satosi till
[28:13] now I only bought since since 2020 and
[28:16] it feels
[28:17] really um it's an amazing story that you
[28:21] just told where you went out of the
[28:24] traditional system and pursued your own
[28:27] when I can say like that
[28:29] Truth uh and following your like your
[28:33] gut feeling and also I think that's a
[28:35] really motivating and inspiring story
[28:37] when you say like I was uh I was ready
[28:41] to be homeless uh to not be a slave
[28:46] that's amazing statement to make and and
[28:48] I love it and I also just now did this I
[28:51] actually had to day my last uh real
[28:54] working day in the company I still I
[28:56] still am employed one w week but but I
[28:59] used my rest of my holidays now uh so I
[29:03] I can feel that because I went through
[29:05] that change right now I'm not 25 so I'm
[29:08] like a few years back from you and it it
[29:11] I I can I could see myself from you like
[29:13] when you like 28 because I also did
[29:16] quite good I had a sales position really
[29:18] good like from my young age I did really
[29:20] really good also financially and now I'm
[29:22] in this position where I can just quit
[29:24] it and pursue what I really want and I
[29:27] started December with the podcast and I
[29:29] already have like 60 podcast episodes
[29:31] recorded so yeah really really cool um
[29:34] and it takes some guts to do this for me
[29:37] as opposed to someone who already has
[29:39] money because I don't come from a family
[29:41] of money so I realize doing this that
[29:44] there are people who are born with a
[29:46] million dollar in the bank account and
[29:48] they have the luxury of making risky
[29:51] decisions I don't because from the from
[29:54] my the from 16 years old I knew it was I
[29:58] have to work to just maintain the bills
[30:00] to just survive I've had very good
[30:03] parents but they are not rich parents so
[30:05] they have not given me an inheritance so
[30:09] I was like okay every you know every
[30:11] step of this risky path it's there's no
[30:15] safety net for me my safety net is if I
[30:18] ever end up on the street I can go live
[30:21] with my mom if that were to happen but
[30:24] that's basically the extent of it so it
[30:26] was a risky path to take when you
[30:29] consider that I do need an everyday
[30:32] salary to to keep myself up yeah it's
[30:35] definitely um a path that not a lot of
[30:39] people uh go and it's like when you see
[30:43] and when you consider doing that you
[30:45] also consider like the worst case
[30:46] scenario what is if I don't make any
[30:48] money from it what do I do then yeah
[30:51] like usually parents are good safety net
[30:54] if you have the luxury to even if you
[30:57] have the luxury to go to uh your parents
[30:59] and live there that's that's something
[31:01] not even everybody has but most of the
[31:03] people have it um let's come back to the
[31:07] censorship um um topic because I think
[31:10] it's really interesting what happens now
[31:11] with with um social media we have the
[31:14] traditional Facebook YouTube where we
[31:17] just know there is censorship going on
[31:20] you can call it whatever you want to
[31:21] call it but there are some uh topics
[31:24] when you talk about them you will get uh
[31:27] shadow
[31:28] ban or you get less reach or just
[31:31] outright they say this account is taking
[31:34] off and I just like sometimes by
[31:36] accident sometimes by intentions
[31:38] Sometimes some bug happens like there's
[31:40] a lot of things going on but then
[31:42] there's also now Twitter and x with the
[31:44] Twitter files from like one two years
[31:47] ago now in X there's still something
[31:49] going on but it seems like there's more
[31:52] uh allowance of free speech then there's
[31:56] uh other places like Rumble and and
[31:58] streaming places where you can be even
[32:00] more free how do you see like the whole
[32:03] social media landscape and where you can
[32:05] stream and and and how is it developing
[32:08] is it has it a good development now with
[32:11] maybe X and E musk is having kind of an
[32:13] good approach to that like how do you
[32:15] see that I'm fascinated by the current
[32:18] state because I think that what musk did
[32:20] with X is a gift to humanity um I
[32:23] believe that we had an Internet that is
[32:26] BN free um from 1995 to
[32:32] 20156 uh we could do our job and to me
[32:36] and the internet already changed the
[32:38] world then uh because when lives came in
[32:41] when live streaming either live
[32:42] streaming of podcast or videos that were
[32:46] uploaded quick enough that they could
[32:48] basically be watched within the hour
[32:50] then we had a direct route that was not
[32:53] subject to supervision people
[32:55] underestimate the fact of how the the
[32:58] editorial period changes the
[33:01] relationship between the producer of
[33:03] information and the receiver because we
[33:06] were talking about Central entity wire
[33:08] tapping at the middle listening and
[33:11] censoring these entities have a
[33:14] difficult time doing their job if if I
[33:16] can go from producing the video to you
[33:19] hearing it within 10 seconds within 10
[33:22] seconds a human cannot and so that's why
[33:25] the these platforms the more
[33:27] technologically evolved they became when
[33:29] YouTube started allowing live video
[33:31] streaming the more the the window for
[33:34] intervention at the middle was closing
[33:38] and we were at a point where I can think
[33:40] of something I can communicate it and
[33:43] there's no intervention possible and to
[33:45] me I thought this is this is new it's a
[33:48] new thing for Humanity to have this the
[33:51] the closest equivalent would be a large
[33:54] show in which you have an artist and he
[33:56] can directly speak to the crowd that's
[33:58] Gathering but that's local it's isolated
[34:01] and the artists are very often
[34:03] professionals who will not have an
[34:06] interest at shaking our beliefs they
[34:09] will not have an interest at pursuing
[34:11] the contrarian route so I believe that
[34:14] 2010 to
[34:16] 2016 was the first time in human
[34:19] civilization where the contrarian brain
[34:22] could directly gather an audience talk
[34:24] to them directly not have someone in the
[34:27] middle stopping his speech and I wanted
[34:30] to exploit this to try to bring us into
[34:33] a new generation of media so I started
[34:36] eventually doing my own streams
[34:38] eventually started co-hosting warski
[34:41] live which became the the biggest live
[34:43] stream on back then on YouTube and
[34:47] eventually moved from warski live to the
[34:49] public space which became a podcast of
[34:51] kind of resistance right-wing IDs now
[34:55] often people will call it altright but
[34:57] it's it's not a label that I I
[34:59] particularly like I consider myself just
[35:01] a right-wing thinker who's conscious
[35:04] about my racial identity and how
[35:06] currently white people are being
[35:08] targeted negatively they're being hated
[35:11] so those were the themes I approached
[35:14] and I wanted to I wanted to do something
[35:17] with the media that couldn't be done on
[35:19] cable TV which is what happens if new
[35:23] truly new IDs are thrown out there and
[35:26] they are provocative
[35:28] and basically from this to the covid-19
[35:31] stuff I've always adopted a contrarian
[35:34] view against the normi world which tries
[35:38] to make these subject taboos which tries
[35:40] to impose uh in the case of covid a kind
[35:44] of mytical fascism I thought what if we
[35:47] were to use free speech for what it's
[35:49] been designed for from the beginning
[35:52] which is you have this society that
[35:53] claims it's liberal that claims it's
[35:55] open and we want diversity we want
[35:58] cognitive diversity I'm going to give
[36:01] them something that's cognitively
[36:03] diverse I'm going to give them whatst
[36:05] looking at the world can think of it and
[36:09] it's that we live in a very hyp
[36:11] hypocritical World in which people have
[36:14] been feeling apparently uh entitled to
[36:18] decide what others consume in terms of
[36:21] medical vaccines who who judge each
[36:23] other who who imperialistic try to
[36:26] control their environment and their
[36:28] neighbors that is not a liberal world in
[36:31] the way I was promised we were in the
[36:32] liberal world that is a world of fism of
[36:37] control and authoritarianism so I tried
[36:40] to live by the standards of the early
[36:43] liberals who have created our
[36:45] constitution in our world which is
[36:47] Liberty should be able with speech with
[36:50] well organized speech we should be able
[36:53] to
[36:54] untie the shackles that were put over us
[36:57] and that's what I've been pursuing with
[36:59] my media and eventually uh Susan withi
[37:03] at YouTube started highly controlling
[37:06] what we could say I believe that there's
[37:09] still something that is not revealed
[37:11] publicly about how is it that we get so
[37:13] much censorship I believe that someone
[37:15] must be paying for this when I see uh
[37:18] Susan wji making deals with associations
[37:22] non non-governmental organization and
[37:25] saying oh we will partner with the ADL
[37:27] on
[37:28] anti-Semitism and we will partner with
[37:30] fiser on vaccines I believe someone is
[37:33] pouring massive amounts of money on
[37:35] these platforms either indirectly
[37:37] through purchasing ads or directly
[37:40] through funding and they are basically
[37:42] setting up a a totally anti- internet uh
[37:46] system because the internet precisely
[37:49] was meant to be modular to be okay if
[37:53] you don't pass this packet I'm going to
[37:55] pass through another route so so that
[37:57] basically the signal will never be
[37:59] interfered with but this this trend of
[38:03] censorship is going totally against the
[38:05] original philosophy of the internet and
[38:08] totally against the philosophy of crypto
[38:10] also uh which is that you should not be
[38:13] subjected to review for something you
[38:16] engage freely in um one example be and
[38:20] you know one of the the biggest subject
[38:22] the one that is most taboo is one that
[38:25] I've addressed which is Jews in
[38:28] Civilization and I've always tried to
[38:30] approach it in the most wise and
[38:33] non-hateful and loving way because I
[38:37] feel no hate for the Jews but you know
[38:40] there are a certain amount of
[38:42] contributions they have done to Western
[38:44] civilization that I believe we should
[38:45] face we should be honest about the fact
[38:48] that they are over represented in
[38:50] certain industries and that it could
[38:52] change the directions we take so I've
[38:55] been engaging on this subject and
[38:56] eventually unfortunately YouTube Took
[38:58] the direction of any talking of Jews
[39:01] even if you're positive even if you're
[39:04] saying that you're not hateful it's
[39:06] going to be anti-Semitism they've
[39:08] basically defined the whole thing which
[39:11] which I think is self- punishing for for
[39:13] these minorities just saying LGBT on on
[39:17] YouTube would demonetize your video
[39:19] because there were so much anti-lgbt
[39:22] videos that the algorithm would
[39:24] basically decide oh it's probably a g
[39:27] but we found ourselves in a bizarre
[39:29] situation where people who are lesbians
[39:32] or trans they were finding all of their
[39:34] videos demonetized just because they
[39:37] were touching about the subject that
[39:39] totally concerns themselves but the
[39:41] algorithm had decided generally it's
[39:44] right-wing belief so we're going to
[39:46] censor it so you are shooting yourself
[39:48] in the foot with censorship and what
[39:52] what Elon did is he came back and he
[39:54] brought it back he brought back the
[39:57] internet before censorship how it looked
[40:00] like it's still not perfect I think that
[40:03] Elon has kept Nick frontes away from
[40:05] Twitter he has kept certain of of my
[40:08] friends and people who are close to me
[40:11] ideologically I find this very uh
[40:13] deplorable but at least he tried and
[40:16] he's he shot not so far from the target
[40:19] so that is very good we are in a very
[40:22] hopeful situation because
[40:24] eventually if if there's just one big
[40:27] platform that can do this the free
[40:29] market forces can reconfigure and
[40:33] perhaps in the future in 10 years from
[40:35] now YouTube may lose the status of the
[40:38] biggest video platform because of this
[40:40] or they will have to change the way they
[40:43] impede on their Creator's ability to
[40:45] think because that is the greatest
[40:47] critique that I have of YouTube and
[40:50] censorship in general it's that it's the
[40:54] the the torture that that they do
[40:56] cognitively to people because okay you
[40:59] know delting a video is not that
[41:02] dramatic uh if as a business you may say
[41:06] well I don't like this video on my
[41:07] business it's not good for my business
[41:09] so I delete it if it was just this it
[41:12] wouldn't be that dramatic but YouTube
[41:15] first is punishing you for life is
[41:17] cutting your opportunities to make money
[41:19] in the future because of that video
[41:22] that's a problem and most importantly
[41:24] it's telling creators you have to self-
[41:27] censor before it gets to our video or
[41:30] else you're going to get a strike by
[41:32] doing so they are imposing a weight on
[41:35] creators like me that has been really
[41:37] feeling like torture over the years and
[41:40] that's why I had to leave YouTube I went
[41:42] for odysse because they were uh you know
[41:45] cryptocurrency tied and I really like
[41:47] their
[41:48] philosophy um so it it's it's just
[41:52] painful to be a Creator and to think not
[41:54] only do I have to think of each sentence
[41:56] and what whether it truly fits the to I
[41:59] also have to think about my guest and I
[42:02] have to hold my mouse on the mute button
[42:04] just in case this guess goes too far
[42:07] it's unfair unfair to be imposing this
[42:10] uh burden and especially when this
[42:12] burden is being imposed unfairly because
[42:15] whenever you have a human system
[42:18] deciding what you can say and think it's
[42:20] of course going to be biased and in this
[42:23] case it is every biased for leftwing IDs
[42:26] so that you can have black people call
[42:30] for uh you know very dirty stuff
[42:32] considering white people and yet you
[42:34] have white people doing the same and
[42:37] they get censored the black people don't
[42:40] get censored for the same so there's no
[42:42] justice in this system it's a system
[42:45] that inherits all of the features of the
[42:47] unjust system I've seen through my life
[42:50] being essed by them and I'm like okay
[42:53] this is the normi world coming to the
[42:55] internet and we have to leave these
[42:57] place and go into a further
[43:01] Exodus yeah it's it's um I hope I think
[43:05] IL musk is doing something really great
[43:07] and I think he is uh really cautious
[43:11] with doing that uh because he has gone
[43:14] like he he took a long time also to take
[43:17] Alex Jones back but he finally back I
[43:20] think he's just like a progress he's
[43:22] taking he does not want to like
[43:24] completely open it on like day one and
[43:27] he's slowly getting it back and he even
[43:30] threatens a lot uh I think YouTube in a
[43:33] massive way he's like with Mr Beast and
[43:36] the experiment with uh in front of the
[43:39] video of the monetization because this
[43:41] drives greatest of course if if if you
[43:44] get from one uh platform like 10 extra
[43:48] money you get from another platform of
[43:49] course you create more here and this is
[43:51] the incentive structure and he is doing
[43:54] the first step with the monetization of
[43:56] of Twitter and now with the videos also
[43:58] I guess they will get like an an video
[44:01] portion video tap on Twitter uh quite
[44:04] soon I mean he uh teased that for like
[44:08] half a year now but I think he will get
[44:10] to that point otherwise they can never
[44:13] really compete with with YouTube If
[44:14] there's not a nice interface to it and
[44:17] yeah I think he he's doing a a good
[44:19] thing but for me the underlying thing
[44:22] that's always is is is is weird when we
[44:26] talk about social media and media in
[44:27] general is like um people have to start
[44:32] uh think critical of stuff because this
[44:34] is where the problems come because if if
[44:36] a platform is censoring people will
[44:39] notice if they start thinking uh
[44:41] critical for themselves and they were
[44:43] like oh YouTube is uh censoring this and
[44:46] this and that and oh X is not and this
[44:49] platform is not and this platform is not
[44:51] so I will switch to them so like I think
[44:53] we have like an fundamental crisis with
[44:56] critical thinking in our our society
[44:57] where most people just believe what they
[45:00] hear from any Authority they seem to fit
[45:03] in their Authority scheme uh
[45:07] so maybe a weird question but why is it
[45:10] so hard for people to think critical
[45:13] fors well I think of it from a
[45:15] biological perspective always because I
[45:18] think that biology explains everything
[45:20] that we are and the way I see it is it's
[45:24] a fatality it will always be this
[45:27] because you have no mechanism to
[45:30] maintain in society the capacity for
[45:33] rationality because the fact is it's not
[45:36] that evolutionarily beneficial to be
[45:38] intelligent and rational so what you end
[45:41] up with systematically because a
[45:44] discovery cost a lot to make you know I
[45:47] think just of my theory the theory of
[45:49] phenotypic Revolution I had to spend 10
[45:53] years and it was a lot of sacrifice to
[45:56] get to it
[45:57] it was a lot of thinking a lot of energy
[46:00] a lot of calories that went only to this
[46:04] now so from an evolutionary perspective
[46:07] being a thinker and being rational is
[46:09] not very advantageous especially when
[46:13] thoughts are super easily copyable it's
[46:16] super easy for someone to be a sheep and
[46:19] say okay whatever is the religion where
[46:22] I'm born whatever is the the standard of
[46:24] living and the standard of etiquette I'm
[46:27] going to just absorb everything around
[46:29] me and I'm going to accept it as truth
[46:33] that is probably a much lower calorie
[46:35] much lower energy investment and you
[46:38] probably get to pretty much as good as
[46:41] the intelligent person because the
[46:44] intelligent person himself will have
[46:46] made a discovery in one field but in 99%
[46:50] of what he does in his life he's going
[46:51] to have to trust other people so even a
[46:54] very stubborn and isolated and
[46:57] individual does end up trusting a lot of
[47:00] people in what he eats what he what he
[47:02] breeds what he does every every tool he
[47:05] uses are made by other people so I
[47:09] believe it's the state of human
[47:11] civilization and it's a natural default
[47:13] convergence where intelligence is truly
[47:16] just an accident and most of the time
[47:19] everyone evolves toward being less
[47:21] intelligent and Le more sheepy and more
[47:24] following so I I say you'll always have
[47:28] this the only reason the early internet
[47:31] gave a different view of this is you
[47:33] have a self- selection even that
[47:35] happened the early internet was
[47:38] populated by Visionaries Liberty lovers
[47:41] and people with independent thinking
[47:43] that we kind of autistic now as soon as
[47:47] the internet got regularized and got
[47:50] normified if you will it got populated
[47:53] by the rest of the population that
[47:55] always follow up wherever
[47:57] which is why for people like me who are
[47:59] contrarian and isolationist kind of and
[48:03] Libertarians
[48:04] basically life is a constant Exodus I
[48:08] always ask myself how do I get further
[48:10] away from people because every time I
[48:13] did it made me more happy it's a an
[48:16] interesting uh way to look at it it's
[48:19] like going away from people is making
[48:21] you more
[48:25] happy I guess
[48:28] I get sick of it's interesting um uh for
[48:32] closing up the podcast we have an entro
[48:34] team where the previous guest is always
[48:38] asking a question for the next guest
[48:40] without knowing who's the next guest is
[48:42] and as I have a lot of bitcoiners on
[48:44] it's it's obviously a Bitcoin
[48:48] question and it's an interesting one
[48:51] because it's we have in Bitcoin it's
[48:53] like money is so fundamental to our life
[48:57] money if we fix money we can fix uh so
[48:59] many problems in our society so we have
[49:02] to saying Bitcoin fixes everything and
[49:06] he raised one point where like I don't
[49:08] know how Bitcoin fixes that and he's he
[49:12] asked how does how can Bitcoin help
[49:14] someone living like paycheck to
[49:17] paycheck uh help this person who living
[49:21] pay to pay if can can Bitcoin even help
[49:24] this
[49:25] person well um absolutely
[49:30] absolutely because Bitcoin can make you
[49:33] realize that you have an out and just
[49:36] having that out might change your
[49:38] mentality about some of the things that
[49:41] you spend on paycheck to paycheck as
[49:44] long as you are stuck in this eternal
[49:47] cycle of paying the bills trying to make
[49:50] money at the job and trying to get some
[49:52] overtime so you get a little extra and
[49:55] then seeing it all being drained from
[49:57] your bank account for just your survival
[50:00] you might not see that there are things
[50:03] that you consider in your survival to be
[50:05] necessary for now that you could get rid
[50:07] of but once suddenly this option comes
[50:11] of a true Ledger where you can truly
[50:13] store suddenly you might realize hey
[50:16] there are things that are less important
[50:18] than I thought they were maybe I don't
[50:20] need to go to McDonald today maybe that
[50:22] five bucks could be a good investment
[50:24] for Bitcoin and when you start thinking
[50:27] about the infinity that stems from a
[50:30] finite Supply you start realizing that
[50:33] hey this
[50:34] $5 invested today in a 100 years from
[50:38] now could be the equivalent of a million
[50:40] dollars with all the Bitcoin that will
[50:42] be lost with all the the imperfections
[50:45] of the system that $5 may very well be a
[50:48] million dollar in finite energy thinking
[50:52] so when you have that option uh you
[50:54] might realize that hey well what the
[50:57] life you've been living of slavery and
[50:59] paycheck to paycheck is not as close
[51:01] loop as you think it's just that the
[51:03] option wasn't there before Bitcoin the
[51:07] option was oh maybe I'm going to put in
[51:09] a savings account maybe I'm going to buy
[51:11] a certificate of deposit for $100 and
[51:15] all of it had cost and all of it were
[51:17] low interest when you start thinking
[51:19] that you can truly accumulate the energy
[51:22] of a
[51:23] $5 you're going to realize that you're
[51:25] living to paycheck to paycheck uh does
[51:28] as place for a little extra use that
[51:31] little extra to help your descendants
[51:33] down the line because the best thing you
[51:36] can do in your life paycheck to paycheck
[51:38] the day you die there's probably going
[51:40] to be nothing left of you especially if
[51:43] you don't have a house you don't have an
[51:45] inheritance but you can store 24 words
[51:47] on a piece of metal right now and your
[51:50] great grandchildren might see you as the
[51:52] most Visionary men for having stored
[51:55] five bucks a way for them it's a it's
[51:59] it's a great way to think about it and
[52:02] like even as you said like you got some
[52:05] Bitcoin uh on your live stream like 0.1
[52:10] 0.05 and it was not a big deal back then
[52:12] it it was like a few Euros but it turned
[52:14] out to be a big deal in hindsight uh you
[52:18] never know what happens and we're so
[52:19] early in the game people people don't
[52:21] realize that we are actually that early
[52:24] in Bitcoin it's like so early like 1995
[52:27] in the Internet seem like the iPhone is
[52:29] still 12 years away yeah uh perfect uh
[52:33] thank you for for being on thank you for
[52:35] taking the time uh and uh yeah is there
[52:38] anything you want to add or where can
[52:40] people find you where can people get in
[52:42] touch with you the best way I will say
[52:45] shout out to trigger a part of your
[52:47] audience I will say shout out to the
[52:49] ordinals lover uh and if you want to
[52:52] read my ordinals letter to humanity
[52:54] because that's one function of the
[52:55] blockchain we have talked about today
[52:57] but you can store messages for Humanity
[53:00] Forever on the blockchain and I did it
[53:03] to write a letter to humanity you can go
[53:05] check it out at jfg dworld and you'll
[53:08] see all of my links on there my letter
[53:11] to humans on Gene editing talking to
[53:14] future humans that is one thing that the
[53:17] Bitcoin blockchain has allowed me to do
[53:19] that I I never thought I could because
[53:21] we die entropy takes everything we do
[53:25] away but entropy has no take on the
[53:28] Bitcoin
[53:29] blockchain amazing uh thank you for
[53:32] being on it was a pleasure
[53:39] bye-bye
