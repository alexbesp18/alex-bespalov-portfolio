[00:00] you can always say some Fiat number okay
[00:01] sure it'll eventually reach that but is
[00:03] a Bitcoin going to be worth more than
[00:04] 10,000 acres of land Bitcoin is already
[00:06] a success it's kind of amazing to see so
[00:09] much of traditional Finance coming over
[00:11] there's 8 billion people but there's
[00:12] going to be 100 billion robots running
[00:14] around they're going to spend Bitcoin
[00:16] right they're not going to be spending
[00:17] gold coins or or you know whatever fiat
[00:20] currency then you could make a case that
[00:21] there's there's an even bigger Market
[00:23] that doesn't exist yet there's been a
[00:24] huge drop off in the number of Articles
[00:26] saying that Bitcoin is bad for the
[00:28] environment for example since then I %
[00:30] for a massive massive fund is a lot more
[00:32] than just a couple of regular people
[00:34] saying oh yeah I want to put 50% of my
[00:36] money into that and the rebalancing
[00:38] effect means that if you have Bitcoin
[00:40] down then they're going to buy more
[00:41] Bitcoin and if Bitcoin goes way up
[00:43] they're actually going to be selling
[00:44] some Bitcoin to get back down to that
[00:46] Target level this has a stabilizing
[00:48] effect actually and it could result in a
[00:51] longer sustained rally if you completely
[00:53] stopped updating the codebase Bitcoin
[00:55] would eventually start falling apart
[00:58] will Bitcoin be uh my the planetary uh
[01:01] currency one
[01:02] [Music]
[01:05] day what was some of your highlights
[01:08] what was some of the the things that you
[01:09] have been witnessing the last like
[01:11] couple of months in the Bitcoin scene
[01:13] that was uh not worthy for
[01:15] you I mean there's there's a lot I first
[01:19] off I got to see uh Baltic honey badger
[01:21] in Ria uh there was a conference that
[01:24] was on my list for a long time and uh
[01:26] it's always nice to go to the the small
[01:29] serious conferences where you have
[01:31] bitcoiners who really are building
[01:34] amazing things um for other bitcoiners
[01:37] and uh then you also get to uh hang out
[01:40] with some of those excellent bitcoiners
[01:42] as well without having to be uh VIP yeah
[01:46] definitely they are really really cool
[01:48] and what what about like the the things
[01:50] that happened in Bitcoin I mean the like
[01:52] Bitcoin ETF happened the the Haring I
[01:55] think happened in between and so many
[01:57] other things yeah yeah yeah there
[01:59] there's some as they say there there're
[02:00] weeks when decades happen right and it's
[02:02] been it's been pretty crazy uh um C
[02:05] certainly with the way uh you know
[02:06] Bitcoin Twitter Works people can only
[02:08] remember the the last one or two things
[02:10] that happened and it's like oh right we
[02:12] actually had the entire launch of the
[02:14] spot ETF um because every every ETF you
[02:18] know for bit spot ETF for Bitcoin had
[02:20] been denied but then almost every single
[02:23] ETF that black rock had applied for had
[02:25] been approved so then it's like what
[02:26] happens when these two meet yeah they
[02:28] they got what they wanted and uh I think
[02:31] most bitcoiners also got what they
[02:32] wanted here because this is what just
[02:35] allows so much more money to flow in the
[02:38] existing products were were not quite
[02:40] right the Futures ETFs didn't track very
[02:43] well and had much higher expenses
[02:46] the gbtc fund had very high expenses you
[02:50] know went to huge premiums and discounts
[02:53] and uh it's great to finally have a the
[02:55] real product for for institutions or for
[02:58] people who are not going to be doing
[03:00] their own custody um and I think we'
[03:03] we've seen a pretty huge effect already
[03:05] from that simply that so much so much
[03:07] more um so much more money and more
[03:11] interest and legitimacy has come in um
[03:13] there's been a huge drop off in the
[03:15] number of Articles saying that Bitcoin
[03:17] is bad for the environment for example
[03:19] since then um so that's there's
[03:21] definitely a a change in tone and
[03:22] actually most recently um the SEC
[03:25] approved options on the uh spot Bitcoin
[03:28] ETFs which again there's there's some
[03:30] bitcoiners that they don't they don't
[03:32] really understand why that that's
[03:34] important or they think it's just
[03:36] gambling or someone but um options and
[03:38] other derivatives are actually very
[03:40] useful tools for the people that need
[03:43] them in in terms of um hedging their
[03:45] exposure uh in just in terms of even um
[03:48] measuring the volatility of the markets
[03:51] accurately um and that helps bring in a
[03:53] lot more a lot more people um it can
[03:56] also just be a much more Capital
[03:57] efficient way to to invest in something
[04:01] or it can be a way for um somebody to
[04:05] get honest yield on their um ETF uh
[04:09] Holdings
[04:11] because right uh most recently there's
[04:14] some controversy as uh Michael Sor used
[04:17] the phrase risk-free um and that's a
[04:20] that's a scary one right because really
[04:22] nothing is risk-free um and if somebody
[04:25] says there's there's no risk then either
[04:27] they don't understand what the risk is
[04:30] or they're they're not telling you what
[04:32] the risk is right because every
[04:34] opportunity has a you know a risk right
[04:37] every thing where you can make money
[04:39] there's also a scenario in which you can
[04:41] lose so uh if somebody sells covered
[04:45] calls uh their selling options on their
[04:48] Bitcoin position that means that in the
[04:50] event that Bitcoin goes up very sharply
[04:53] or uh quickly they could end up no
[04:56] longer having those Bitcoin right they
[04:58] end up getting a little bit the upside
[05:00] and then missing the the remaining piece
[05:03] right and the issue with that is then if
[05:05] um the dollar is losing value then they
[05:08] just end up with dollars right and they
[05:10] might they might think now oh wow if I
[05:13] had this much dollars I'd be great but
[05:15] that's now and maybe in the future you
[05:18] wouldn't think that and the risk is that
[05:20] somebody could then um end up selling
[05:24] their position because of the covered
[05:25] calls and then they would end up buying
[05:27] in a potentially higher price um but it
[05:29] but it also depends right so that that
[05:31] can also be useful a useful way for
[05:33] somebody if they were saying okay I have
[05:35] this much Bitcoin position and I would
[05:37] sell a little piece of it at a certain
[05:39] price to actually start getting paid the
[05:42] premiums for being willing to do that
[05:45] now by locking in that future price and
[05:47] then for somebody else that could be a
[05:49] way for them to say hey I I need I want
[05:52] to um I'm very bullish on bitcoin I I
[05:55] think we're going to a million dollars
[05:56] you know within a
[05:58] year they if if they're actually correct
[06:01] in that they can make a lot more money
[06:03] by buying those calls that someone else
[06:05] is selling than just buying Bitcoin
[06:07] directly because it gives them much more
[06:09] leverage without the possibility of them
[06:12] being forced out of the position if
[06:14] Bitcoin drops first before it goes up so
[06:17] is it fair to say that just like a lot
[06:19] of the existing tools inside of the Fiat
[06:23] system now come to bitcoin and a lot of
[06:26] the maturity of of the asset is just
[06:29] increasing now with time with DTF
[06:31] especially yeah and yeah the asset is
[06:34] becoming more mature and um I think that
[06:38] does result in uh the price moving a
[06:41] little bit differently I think that you
[06:43] do see um more funds saying okay we want
[06:47] to have 1% or 5% of our funds in Bitcoin
[06:50] and we're going to rebalance say every
[06:52] quarter and then the net result is Right
[06:56] 5% for a massive massive fund is lot
[06:59] more than just a couple of regular
[07:01] people saying oh yeah I want to put 50%
[07:04] of my money into that and then the
[07:06] rebalancing effect means that if you
[07:08] have Bitcoin down then they're going to
[07:11] buy more Bitcoin and if Bitcoin goes way
[07:14] up they're actually going to be selling
[07:15] some Bitcoin to get back down to that
[07:18] Target level so this has a stabilizing
[07:22] effect on the price of Bitcoin actually
[07:24] and it could result in a longer
[07:27] sustained rally but without necessarily
[07:30] the the really sharp moves or maybe more
[07:32] uh retracements on the sharp moves when
[07:34] they occur so this this this breaking of
[07:37] this fouryear cycle could actually occur
[07:39] with within this uh because the the
[07:42] stabilizing and rebalancing effects are
[07:44] coming into Bitcoin it could and that's
[07:46] the case for something that would break
[07:48] that cycle just simply um a new kind of
[07:51] capital coming in in a different way
[07:53] right if you look at something like the
[07:54] launch of the first gold ETF in 2005 it
[07:57] didn't make gold just suddenly go you
[08:01] know massively higher immediately and
[08:02] then that was it there was a large
[08:05] inflow of capital over many many years
[08:08] after that that you know that did change
[08:10] that market um so it's way too soon to
[08:14] say the Cycle's over until it's over
[08:15] right if something is repeating multiple
[08:17] times you you should assume that it will
[08:19] continue until you see otherwise but now
[08:21] we have certain indications that that
[08:24] could be over right and again the cycle
[08:27] breaking does is not necessarily good or
[08:29] bad thing right it's not necessarily
[08:30] good for bulls or Bears um and in some
[08:34] ways Bitcoin going up too sharply and
[08:36] then coming down sharply is is a risk
[08:39] for Bitcoin right because you can have a
[08:41] lot more miners come online and then if
[08:44] you have a huge drop in the price of
[08:47] Bitcoin then they might shut those
[08:49] machines off and sell them and that
[08:50] creates an opportunity for someone to be
[08:53] able to buy a large number of idle as6
[08:55] that they wouldn't be able to otherwise
[08:57] if somebody wanted to attack the network
[08:58] that would be
[09:00] an opportunity for them to do so yeah
[09:02] the the mining aspect I think we even
[09:04] covered it in the first
[09:06] podcast audience was very small so I
[09:08] probably like probably like two people
[09:10] from from here watching have seen that
[09:12] podcast or something like that uh but
[09:14] it's an interesting topic um mining
[09:16] because I think we even discussed that
[09:19] uh when the price moves up uh and down
[09:22] it doesn't immediately affect the
[09:24] Bitcoin mining hash rate as we also seen
[09:27] I think like a year ago or one and a
[09:29] half years ago when we were kind of at
[09:31] the low end of the market mining hash
[09:33] would still hit alltime highs yeah yeah
[09:36] it's just simply takes a long time
[09:38] there's a huge lag there's only so fast
[09:40] you can produce the chips there only so
[09:42] fast you can put them to as6 only so
[09:44] fast you can um find the sites and set
[09:47] them up and actually deploy that so the
[09:50] net result is that a lot of times we've
[09:52] seen in previous bull markets a lot of
[09:54] the hash rate that people wanted to put
[09:55] on while the price was going crazy ended
[09:58] up being deployed in the following year
[10:01] um leading to a particularly unpleasant
[10:03] mining environment where the price is
[10:06] going down and the hash rate is going
[10:09] up um and uh it it's tough for the
[10:13] miners but you know it isn't about the
[10:16] miners being happy because again if the
[10:17] miners are net unhappy then miners will
[10:19] quit until the remaining ones are
[10:23] happy uh so it's self uh balancing there
[10:27] um but as I said if if it drops too
[10:29] sharply then that poses more of a risk
[10:31] to the network um but you see on uh what
[10:35] Bitcoin Twitter right the uh everybody
[10:37] loves these these models these price
[10:39] models and so on whether it's stock to
[10:40] flow or power law or so on and basically
[10:45] you can just look at a couple of points
[10:47] that happen and you know draw a line
[10:48] through them and say oh yes that will
[10:50] just continue forever magically for no
[10:52] particular reason um and this is really
[10:55] good for engagement it's it's hopium
[10:57] it's the you have the Bitcoin leaders
[10:59] going yeah yeah Bitcoin they're just you
[11:01] know just going to go up for for no
[11:03] reason um and uh that's you know I mean
[11:06] it may be fun for them but it's it's not
[11:08] helpful um because Bitcoin has to
[11:12] survive in an adversarial environment
[11:14] and uh just thinking that things are
[11:16] inevitable is is actually
[11:19] counterproductive right you want to have
[11:21] your adversaries be complacent you don't
[11:23] want to try to make yourself and people
[11:26] on your team more complacent and think
[11:28] it's already it's one because it's not
[11:31] until it is and even when it is it's
[11:33] not um you know Bitcoin is thing that
[11:35] needs to be continuously maintained
[11:38] continuously kept alive right you don't
[11:40] just mine it for the next couple years
[11:41] and then shut the machines off and say
[11:43] you're done you don't just shut the
[11:45] nodes off and say you're done right if
[11:47] you if people stop using Bitcoin or stop
[11:51] supporting it stop developing it it goes
[11:54] away and if nobody needs it that's okay
[11:57] but people need to understand that every
[11:59] aspect of that requires
[12:01] effort this actually uh we have the new
[12:05] end rtin oh no I think it was already
[12:06] tin uh when when you were on the podcast
[12:09] where the previous guest is asking a
[12:10] question for the next guest and I
[12:12] remember the question for you was
[12:14] actually is Bitcoin inovat it's so funny
[12:16] because that's question let's let's put
[12:18] put the question now already uh here and
[12:20] and not and don't put it in the end
[12:22] because it suits so well here right now
[12:24] um so you're saying Bitcoin is not
[12:26] innovat and we have to continue work on
[12:28] it do you mean what what do you mean by
[12:31] that uh like the end routine question
[12:34] was just like is Bitcoin innovat is the
[12:37] Bitcoin success story is Bitcoin
[12:39] inevitable in
[12:41] yeah terrible sorry no no it's not it's
[12:45] not inevitable it's definitely
[12:47] definitely not um and again I obviously
[12:52] I've I've you know made my investment
[12:54] decisions accordingly I've made I've
[12:56] allocated my time accordingly that I'm
[12:59] confident in Bitcoin success now but
[13:01] it's not inevitable there still are
[13:04] plenty of things that can go wrong and I
[13:06] like to imagine somebody you know builds
[13:08] a time machine and they they go back to
[13:10] the early years of Bitcoin and you know
[13:12] say oh I'm going to buy up tons tons of
[13:13] Bitcoin and you know and they'll be
[13:16] they'll be thrilled and then in that
[13:18] scenario Bitcoin doesn't become a thing
[13:20] right maybe they've you know they've
[13:22] just altered the timeline and maybe
[13:23] there was in the early days there was
[13:25] only one scenario out of 100 where we
[13:28] are where we are now now and the other
[13:30] ones something breaks some you know
[13:32] someone decides to attack the network
[13:34] when it's still very tiny um something
[13:37] goes catastrophically wrong right
[13:39] whether it's the initial deployment of
[13:41] as6 right when somebody when somebody
[13:43] has the first as6 and nobody else does
[13:46] they they made a choice at that point
[13:47] you know to to mine honestly or to try
[13:50] to attack the network and maybe if
[13:53] things were things went differently we
[13:54] wouldn't be where we are so there's
[13:57] there's still plenty of things that can
[13:58] go wrong going forward we're certainly
[14:01] not done there's a lot of more work to
[14:02] be done and there are certain things
[14:05] that um we don't know what that's going
[14:07] to look like right we don't know if uh
[14:09] tomorrow somebody comes up with some
[14:11] super intelligent AI that starts
[14:13] breaking algorithms that have been uh
[14:16] believed to be
[14:17] bulletproof is there a point um where
[14:21] you say now Bitcoin is definitely a
[14:23] success is there point where when when
[14:25] those things are happening uh Bitcoin is
[14:28] definitely uh something that that will
[14:30] stay around for the next like 100 200
[14:32] years is there some some like adoption
[14:35] point or metrics that that it hits I
[14:39] mean I think Bitcoin is already a
[14:40] success in in a number of ways if it's
[14:43] kind of amazing to see so much of
[14:45] traditional Finance coming over to it
[14:48] and trying to figure out what products
[14:50] they can offer um the the full the full
[14:53] Suite of everything right the from
[14:55] custody to um to later to you know
[14:58] lending against it and so on using as
[15:00] collateral
[15:01] um but yeah it's uh as Yogi bar said
[15:05] predicting is hard especially about the
[15:07] future so um and I think we've seen with
[15:10] a lot of things some things are
[15:12] accelerating so it's I think the world
[15:14] could look wildly dramatically different
[15:17] by
[15:18] 2140 um if you think about things like
[15:20] um you know the the rate of AI is
[15:22] improving people are putting um you know
[15:25] computer chips in their head and have
[15:27] telepathy um what that might look like
[15:30] in terms of what encryption algorithms
[15:31] are still working uh or if if people
[15:35] even have any privacy at all right if
[15:37] you need to be able to write down 12
[15:39] seed words and keep them in your head
[15:41] then is there a space in which you can
[15:43] do that and is your head
[15:46] secure um at that point
[15:49] uh certainly I I hope we we go down a
[15:53] good scenario um but it's it's really
[15:56] hard to it's hard to say things could
[15:58] look so completely different at that
[16:00] point um you know maybe money looks
[16:04] pretty different if you know everyone is
[16:06] telepathically communicating with
[16:07] everybody else I don't know because
[16:09] money is a way for people to you know
[16:10] cooperate across space and time but it's
[16:13] not the only way so you know Society
[16:15] could evolve in a very unusual Direction
[16:17] and we'll see I can only look maybe a
[16:19] couple years out or maybe one or two
[16:21] decades uh two decades is already a long
[16:25] time if you like we can always speculate
[16:28] and and see what's the future but it's
[16:29] really hard to predict the long term um
[16:32] maybe let's focus on what we can do with
[16:35] with Bitcoin now uh um to to to improve
[16:38] it to have uh some uh some some
[16:41] improvements for Bitcoin to make it
[16:43] scalable for the long run there's a
[16:45] lightning Network there's potential soft
[16:47] Forks what can we do in in that area
[16:50] yeah so it's it's been interesting to
[16:52] see those discussions and um it looks
[16:56] disorganized but that's what Bitcoin
[16:59] governance is right there is no formal
[17:02] process of well you have this person has
[17:04] this role and this person has this role
[17:05] and these people have this many votes
[17:07] and they put it there and then there's
[17:09] another round um it's it's literally you
[17:12] know people putting out ideas talking to
[17:15] each other writing code other people
[17:17] commenting on that code and then trying
[17:20] to in some way unspecified to find a
[17:24] consensus for what makes sense to go
[17:26] forward
[17:29] so it's it's interesting that we saw
[17:31] with um segwit that was a an upgrade
[17:34] where there was a lot of resistance and
[17:36] controversy and so on um even though
[17:38] that ultimately went through um but then
[17:41] we had another uh soft fork with tapro
[17:44] where it was relatively
[17:45] non-controversial as most people thought
[17:48] hey I see a lot of upsides here I don't
[17:49] see much downside and it seemed like a a
[17:52] logical
[17:53] continuation um the interesting thing is
[17:55] where we are now there isn't one logical
[17:57] path forward there's a a lot of people
[18:00] who see multiple different directions
[18:02] that Bitcoin can go
[18:04] in as well as there's um newly
[18:07] emboldened people who want Bitcoin to
[18:09] aify they want to just simply resist all
[18:12] changes right and there's even
[18:14] discussions within that and
[18:16] disagreements of what that looks like
[18:17] right whether that's means just bug
[18:19] fixes whether that that means just you
[18:21] know minor improvements or whether you
[18:23] can actually add you know soft forks and
[18:25] so on and um or if it just means that
[18:28] you'll you'll need to do the absolutely
[18:30] necessary things like um potentially
[18:33] hard Forks to fix major bugs that could
[18:36] be a factor decades from now
[18:39] um so I think it's great to see that
[18:41] discussion right whether um people
[18:43] putting different things out there like
[18:45] uh CTV or opcat um or even the idea of
[18:49] uh maybe restoring lots and lots of
[18:51] previous Ops op codes and then just
[18:54] imposing some other kind of limit to
[18:56] keep things manageable um
[19:00] and you know the the challenge is of
[19:03] course seeing how those things would
[19:05] actually look right it's hard to think
[19:08] about the full implications of things
[19:10] because you have to consider if you
[19:12] enable one feature how does that
[19:14] interact with all the previous features
[19:16] but also any future changes we make um
[19:20] and simply making any changes to bitcoin
[19:23] does take time right there there's still
[19:25] an ongoing process to get people to
[19:27] fully use all of tap roots
[19:30] features but also we can really rush
[19:33] things because part of the reason they
[19:36] didn't include certain upgrades in tap
[19:38] rout that they might have wanted to is
[19:40] because it wasn't clear then what was
[19:42] the best way to do that or whether there
[19:44] would be even better optimizations for
[19:46] some of the things they wanted to do so
[19:50] as as time passes as people are continue
[19:52] working on this and discussing this they
[19:54] find better ways to do things um they
[19:57] think that you know they say okay well I
[19:59] have this really cool idea but it
[20:00] requires this soft Fork it requires this
[20:02] op code and then after working on it for
[20:05] a year or two years maybe sometimes 10
[20:07] years then they realize oh actually
[20:09] there is a way to do it without that op
[20:10] code maybe there is a way to just do it
[20:13] now and there might be some kind of
[20:15] trade-off in terms of you know the cost
[20:17] or the speed or the Elegance of the
[20:19] solution but they they find that there
[20:22] is a way to to do it without that and um
[20:25] that's pretty cool and then you can see
[20:27] what the level of demand for that
[20:29] actually is how much people want to use
[20:31] it and if people do want to use it then
[20:33] maybe you can get the consensus for
[20:35] other changes that would make it even
[20:36] better it's really interesting when we
[20:38] talk about the Bitcoin code because it
[20:40] seems like it's already a very stable
[20:42] thing that should not um change too much
[20:45] but there also seems to be a risk if we
[20:48] say like oh no it's it's fixed and done
[20:50] and we will never ever touch it again
[20:53] right right if you completely stopped
[20:55] updating the code base Bitcoin would
[20:58] eventually start falling apart
[21:01] um so there's a there's a section of
[21:04] there's a region of India that's um
[21:06] extremely humid and has lots of small
[21:08] small Creeks through it so people
[21:11] figured out how to um grow the trees
[21:14] across these uh these Creeks these
[21:16] streams and you basically have these
[21:19] living wooden bridges and because the
[21:21] the bridges are still made from wood
[21:23] that's alive they don't they don't rot
[21:25] they don't Decay if you chop down the
[21:27] trees and built a wooden bridge as soon
[21:29] as you built it it would start falling
[21:31] apart it would start degrading so the
[21:34] fact is you're you're taking advantage
[21:35] of the fact that the tree is constantly
[21:37] updating and making these improvements
[21:39] to itself even though the bridge itself
[21:41] isn't really noticeably
[21:43] changing so you Bitcoin needs to be uh
[21:47] refreshed in that way just to stay where
[21:49] it is to be compatible with the changes
[21:52] in other aspects of the computer
[21:54] operating systems and so on right
[21:56] other Internet Protocol that it's
[21:59] interacting with um those those aren't
[22:01] static those are changing um and in fact
[22:05] if you you know go back and try to you
[22:07] know run original Bitcoin clients it's
[22:09] it's not as easy as you think if you go
[22:11] back and try to run computer software
[22:13] from the 1980s or so on it's it's not
[22:17] that straightforward um and uh so there
[22:22] just even that minimum level to keep
[22:24] where you are but also that people over
[22:26] time might find other bugs or there
[22:28] might be you know flaws in some kind of
[22:30] algorithm or method that Bitcoin is
[22:32] using that needs to be fixed
[22:36] um and so that's that's the absolute
[22:39] minimum there right and then also that
[22:42] sometimes the world can change
[22:43] dramatically right there may be
[22:45] different needs and so on and that if
[22:47] you keep things the same they don't
[22:49] actually stay the same right if you look
[22:51] at um an area like San Francisco where
[22:53] they built a lot of these um single
[22:55] family homes in the city um they thought
[22:58] oh no we don't want to you know more
[23:00] people are moving here but we don't want
[23:01] to build tall build you know a lot of
[23:03] tall buildings replacing these single
[23:04] family homes because that would change
[23:06] the city so they kept the single family
[23:08] homes but then the problem is instead of
[23:11] one normal person living in there now
[23:13] there's maybe you know there's a whole
[23:14] bunch of people paying a lot of money
[23:16] each you know sharing a room so the
[23:19] place did change right um even though
[23:21] you said you weren't going to change
[23:23] anything simply because there's more
[23:25] Demand right and that that's you know we
[23:27] saw that happen with Bitcoin where were
[23:28] years of essentially no no effective
[23:32] limit on block size because it was never
[23:34] reached because there was never enough
[23:36] demand to actually run up against those
[23:38] limits and then once people started
[23:40] running up against those limits
[23:43] the the way Bitcoin worked seemed to
[23:46] change so nothing was changed and yet it
[23:48] seemed like a change was made because of
[23:51] that change in demand so then there
[23:53] that's why you had people saying oh well
[23:55] they just keep making the block size
[23:57] bigger so it can be like how it was
[23:58] again we need to change it so it can go
[24:00] back to being
[24:02] unchanged um and you can do that but up
[24:05] to a point before it then breaks Bitcoin
[24:07] in other
[24:08] ways so that's that's why you had that
[24:11] incredible tension of people saying well
[24:13] no we need to scale in a smarter way not
[24:16] just a Brute Force way but the problem
[24:18] is scaling in a smarter way takes much
[24:21] more time it takes much more
[24:22] sophistication and it's harder to
[24:24] explain to people how it works and um I
[24:27] think that's one of the the the reasons
[24:29] that we've seen some of that frustration
[24:31] with with lightning now even though
[24:33] lightning has come such a long way from
[24:35] from six years ago um it's gotten better
[24:38] and better um
[24:40] but lightning works really well when you
[24:43] are having these bidirectional payment
[24:46] flows when you're getting paid in
[24:48] lightning SATs and then you're spending
[24:50] in lightning SATs right and then you're
[24:52] you're using that same channel liquidity
[24:54] over and over and over um when you have
[24:57] more directional flows when it's more
[24:59] that you're getting paid in it or you're
[25:01] mostly spending in it but not both then
[25:05] you need to um open and close channels
[25:08] more often right you need to do more
[25:09] onchain
[25:10] transactions uh you need to uh splice
[25:13] channels and so on and uh you need to
[25:15] rebalance the liquidity and that you
[25:17] don't get as strong a scaling effect
[25:19] right you don't get to see the real
[25:22] seamless nature of it when it's uh you
[25:25] have to go back to the base layer so
[25:26] much um so so that's why I think you uh
[25:31] some people are frustrated because
[25:32] there's this very strong Network effect
[25:33] of lightning and people don't realize
[25:35] that Network effect is great when when
[25:39] you have the network already built out
[25:42] right but when the network is still very
[25:43] small then the network effect is working
[25:45] against you because you think okay great
[25:48] I need to I need to go you know open
[25:51] these channels and now if there's not
[25:53] enough places to spend lightning if
[25:55] there's not enough opportunities to get
[25:57] paid in and or used that if there's NF
[25:59] exchanges that are supporting it then
[26:01] then it feels like that that capital is
[26:03] is not being active right it feels like
[26:06] it's it's outside it's locked whereas
[26:08] when you get to a situation where lots
[26:11] of people are using lightning you're
[26:12] using it all the time lots of people
[26:14] accept it then it feels like anything
[26:16] that's not lightning is the locked
[26:17] capital and when you've moved it into
[26:19] lightning you've you've gotten something
[26:20] that's much more um effective and useful
[26:24] um so there are some some circular
[26:26] economies that have started to uh build
[26:29] up and I'd like to uh you know see some
[26:31] of them sometime I I've heard uh things
[26:33] are happening in like uita Costa Rica um
[26:37] and in uh Berlin El Salvador and and
[26:39] some of those places um but I I just
[26:42] want to say uh it's pretty amazing to go
[26:44] to pubkey in New York City you know I've
[26:46] been there a few times um passing
[26:49] through and uh it's a it's a Bitcoin bar
[26:53] but it looks like a regular dive bar and
[26:56] uh the the payment with lightning there
[26:58] is is perfectly seamless I mean you can
[26:59] also pay with a cash or credit card but
[27:01] it is a you know it's a really seamless
[27:04] experience um and the the food is
[27:07] actually good as well and it's pretty
[27:09] amazing that you go there and you you
[27:11] run into some uh interesting bitcoiners
[27:15] um and you know it makes me wonder where
[27:19] where are the allcoin theme bars right
[27:23] because you know if you look at coin
[27:25] market cap it shows these things it's
[27:26] you know in the in the billions and
[27:27] billions of dollars um but is it is it
[27:30] just an online phenomenon you know is
[27:33] there is there really some real real
[27:35] world traction here are there people
[27:36] that are passionate enough to say Hey
[27:39] you know my coin is money so here's
[27:41] something where you can just use it in
[27:44] that regular way or maybe maybe I just
[27:46] haven't heard of it but I I don't think
[27:48] that that's there I never heard about
[27:50] that it's also interesting
[27:52] because I think the most the the biggest
[27:56] altcoin that still gets uh in my
[27:59] comments is still Bitcoin cash which is
[28:01] uh fascinating for me because it's by
[28:04] far not the biggest altcoin it's a it's
[28:07] the free market has kind of decided that
[28:09] Bitcoin is the way to go and Bitcoin
[28:11] cash crashed massively but this is a
[28:14] comment that I get like at least once a
[28:17] week maybe even like every other day um
[28:20] like oh Bitcoin is great but Bitcoin
[28:22] cash we need for for payment rates and
[28:24] then I'm like no like I I go to bars in
[28:26] Vienna even there's like a nice bar and
[28:29] restaurant here where you can B with
[28:30] lightning there are multiples but one
[28:32] where there a real Bitcoin are working
[28:34] and and stuff like that uh and I use
[28:37] lightning a lot for for for payments
[28:39] here and there at Bitcoin conferences uh
[28:41] but also like in in regular bars in New
[28:43] York City bars by the way uh uh you
[28:47] probably also saw the video where uh the
[28:50] first president uh Trump made a Bitcoin
[28:53] transaction or watched a Bitcoin
[28:55] transaction before him so that's pretty
[28:58] interesting what's your thoughts yeah
[29:00] yeah it's funny to to go to a dive bar
[29:02] and then later see see a you know video
[29:05] video like that um H yeah I also you
[29:08] know went to a basement in uh in Ria
[29:11] laia right after the Baltic honey badger
[29:13] conference um and that's also you know
[29:16] Bitcoin theme bar they have some some
[29:18] nice um you know
[29:19] memorabilia there
[29:22] um and uh you know the owner the owner's
[29:25] orange build right um and that's uh I
[29:29] think that's one you know the key there
[29:30] right if the owner really appreciates it
[29:33] and understands uh the significance then
[29:36] that that drives that drives it success
[29:39] more than
[29:40] anything um but but yeah the uh people
[29:45] spending Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency
[29:48] right that doesn't have as much impact
[29:50] on the price the people just hoarding it
[29:54] has a huge impact on the price right and
[29:55] people buy sending and buying with it
[29:59] that that starts to build up that
[30:00] economy that starts to make it a real
[30:03] thing and not just some oh well maybe
[30:06] somebody will use this someday but but
[30:09] at the same time that it's just much
[30:10] less of an effect so if everyone is
[30:13] spending something but nobody actually
[30:15] wants to have it then the actual price
[30:19] or value of it stay you know the
[30:20] equilibrium is pretty
[30:22] low um and you can the way I like to
[30:25] look at it is like the the syn synthetic
[30:28] hodlers right if somebody uh you know
[30:31] buys a certain amount of um Bitcoin and
[30:34] then just sends it to somebody else and
[30:36] then that person cashes out of it into
[30:38] the local fiat
[30:39] currency um let's say you know the
[30:42] amount of time the money was stored in
[30:44] Bitcoin was one day right so then it's 1
[30:48] 365th of if you had held it for a full
[30:51] year in terms of the impact on the price
[30:53] if you imagine lots of other people
[30:55] buying in for a day and selling right CU
[30:57] When you sell the Bitcoin then it's
[30:58] going to somebody else and maybe they
[30:59] hold on to it for a day and then they
[31:01] sell it so you you know 365 people has
[31:05] the effect of one person who just bought
[31:07] those Bitcoin and just sits on it for
[31:10] the full year um in terms of the impact
[31:12] on the price so it's great when it
[31:14] things are
[31:15] circulating
[31:16] um and uh it's it's another way to
[31:19] orange pill people as well that people
[31:21] see oh hey you know this person just uh
[31:23] you know took card tapped oh that was
[31:26] that was a Bitcoin payment you know
[31:28] um I thought it was hard right because
[31:30] even with the the comments you know from
[31:32] the pubkey video you know people are
[31:33] saying oh yeah but it doesn't it take
[31:35] like you know 15 minutes or something
[31:36] it's like no look look look at the video
[31:39] um and the nice thing with lightning is
[31:42] that's that's actually done right it is
[31:44] actually settled when you get that
[31:46] payment um in notification whereas uh
[31:51] with with any kind of just layer one
[31:54] blockchain
[31:56] you um you know know a lot of times the
[31:58] user interface tells you oh yeah I went
[32:00] through but there still might be zero
[32:02] confirmations or maybe there's one
[32:04] confirmation but that's not quite enough
[32:06] on that blockchain that you're using so
[32:09] it's easy for the user interface to try
[32:11] to make it look like it's it's final or
[32:13] whatever but um if it's if it's not
[32:16] final then that's uh that's misleading
[32:18] people in order to Market it there
[32:21] there's also an interesting debate going
[32:22] on with uh hodling Bitcoin and just
[32:25] using feat and whatever left in feat
[32:28] putting in Bitcoin versus uh putting it
[32:31] all in Bitcoin and when you need money
[32:33] you spend your Bitcoin and then replace
[32:35] the Bitcoin in order to uh try to get
[32:39] more transactions to get more volume in
[32:41] in the spending way on on top of Bitcoin
[32:44] I personally just like spend in Fe it
[32:46] and then put it in Bitcoin yeah it's it
[32:48] seems to be the easier thing but is
[32:50] there something to to that spend and
[32:51] replace thing yeah again I think
[32:54] different people are going to use
[32:55] Bitcoin in different ways and it's it's
[32:57] like telling telling somebody they're
[32:58] they're eating the you know eating the
[33:00] pizza wrong or something you know you're
[33:02] not supposed to fold it you know you you
[33:04] have to do it like this okay well that
[33:06] that's your opinion um so so right so
[33:10] some people want to spend in replace
[33:12] some people just want to accumulate
[33:15] Bitcoin um and and that's okay right and
[33:18] some people just want to spend Bitcoin
[33:20] and really not keep much of their money
[33:22] in it and that's also and that's also
[33:25] okay and different people are
[33:26] contributing in different ways right
[33:28] they don't they don't have necessarily
[33:29] the same impact on the price or the same
[33:31] impact on the circular economy but
[33:32] that's okay some people are developers
[33:34] some people are user interface designers
[33:37] and some people are just
[33:39] users right some people are Educators
[33:41] some people are you know running hedge
[33:43] funds um and that's that's okay so
[33:46] different people have a role to play um
[33:49] I do just do find it funny if somebody
[33:51] you know buys Bitcoin only as an
[33:53] investment and then they don't want to
[33:54] spend it and they somehow get mad at
[33:56] other people that are spending it
[33:59] and and what I said this people is okay
[34:01] if you never spend any Bitcoin then you
[34:03] don't have you don't have much of your
[34:04] money in Bitcoin you know it's easy to
[34:06] say you never spend it if 10% of your
[34:08] net worth is in Bitcoin but if you are
[34:11] one of the people that's crazy enough to
[34:12] have 90% 100% or more of your netw worth
[34:15] than Bitcoin then you have to spend it
[34:17] you have to sell it sometimes you know
[34:19] you have to convert it into other forms
[34:21] on occasion because it it's simply
[34:23] necessary in order to function yeah I
[34:27] it's it's it's funny because I actually
[34:29] ran into this problem myself because uh
[34:33] um most of my sponsors actually pay me n
[34:35] Bitcoin so I get not only my salary
[34:39] mostly now in Bitcoin but I store also
[34:41] my wealth in Bitcoin so so I kind of
[34:43] have to figure out how to to pay the
[34:45] Fiat bills in order for that uh I either
[34:48] have to loan against my Bitcoin or I
[34:50] have to sell my Bitcoin and spend in in
[34:52] Fiat so that's a that's an interesting
[34:54] point where I am because I I have to use
[34:56] Bitcoin as as a currency because it's
[34:58] just such a dominant position in mind so
[35:01] yeah that's a really great point of
[35:02] yours there thanks um and also the
[35:04] whether spending replacement sense also
[35:06] depends on what country you're in and
[35:07] what taxes you have to pay because in in
[35:09] some places that spend and replace could
[35:11] create a a tax mess and leading to you
[35:14] having less Bitcoin
[35:16] ultimately
[35:18] um uh so um and then the question is
[35:23] right where where are you spending the
[35:24] Bitcoin because if you're spending the
[35:26] Bitcoin at a
[35:28] with a bitcoiner who wants who wants
[35:30] that Bitcoin is keeping it that's just
[35:32] indirectly hodling right if there's um I
[35:35] was at the uh I got to swing by the
[35:37] Stockholm Bitcoin Meetup and it was
[35:39] actually pretty good one um and there
[35:42] was uh someone there who was a you know
[35:43] a Rancher and has uh cows and he wanted
[35:46] to see how he could accept Bitcoin he
[35:48] didn't know that much about it um so if
[35:50] he's you know going to get paid in
[35:52] Bitcoin and keeping it then if somebody
[35:54] needs to buy food and then instead of
[35:56] going to the Super market and paying
[35:58] Fiat they give their Bitcoin to this
[36:00] person who keeps it and then they
[36:01] receive the food from him um that's
[36:04] that's just hling one step removed right
[36:06] but if you just go to some Mega
[36:08] corporation like McDonald's or Starbucks
[36:10] and you say oh I paid with Bitcoin but
[36:12] they instantly converted into Fiat and
[36:14] just essentially sold it to somebody
[36:16] they don't care who um is that that
[36:18] different than you just selling your
[36:20] Bitcoin and then just handing them the
[36:21] Fiat right you're using different rails
[36:24] but it's it's not you know getting
[36:26] Bitcoin into the hand of people who
[36:28] really want it and appreciate it if you
[36:30] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[36:32] regular basis I'll guess you already
[36:34] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[36:37] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[36:40] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[36:42] personal recommendation for harder
[36:44] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[36:47] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[36:49] gift for a friend who has still their
[36:51] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[36:54] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[36:57] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[37:02] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[37:04] to really level up your sovereignty as
[37:07] an individual you have to have the most
[37:09] secure self- custody setup you have to
[37:12] secure your own devices you have to
[37:15] protect your privacy you have to set up
[37:18] an inheritance plan and depending on
[37:20] where you live you even want to have a
[37:23] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[37:25] in case something goes really really
[37:27] really wrong and through all those steps
[37:29] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[37:32] step by step and if you visit the
[37:34] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[37:38] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[37:41] out how you can level up your
[37:43] sovereignty and last but not least I
[37:46] have something completely new for you
[37:48] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[37:52] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[37:55] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[37:58] look at that beauty I love it so much
[38:00] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[38:04] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[38:06] way to go out there and show that you
[38:09] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[38:12] Bitcoin only make sure to check out the
[38:15] link in the description for those
[38:17] amazing coin vigilante time pieces those
[38:20] watches are amazing I love them so much
[38:22] it was really hard for me to pick the
[38:24] one that I want to have because there
[38:26] are a lot of great options I went with
[38:28] the new transparency Edition they are
[38:31] all limited so grab yours those will not
[38:35] be available for a long time but there
[38:36] will come new models and new amazing
[38:39] designs along the way that's a good
[38:41] point like because you have to consider
[38:43] who's the Bitcoin on the other end
[38:45] that's why I like that's why I said
[38:46] there's this restaurant bar where I
[38:48] actually know he's a bitcoiner he's
[38:49] watching the podcast he's actually
[38:51] educated on this stuff he even wants to
[38:53] make content in his bar in his
[38:55] restaurant around Bitcoin I'm like okay
[38:57] yeah I like spending there some some SS
[39:00] there uh but but when it's like
[39:03] McDonald's as you said like yeah it will
[39:05] will probably vanish it's it's not even
[39:07] going on the balance sheet anywhere it's
[39:10] a really interesting point um do you see
[39:12] in general the lightning Network as the
[39:15] next fundamental base layer for for
[39:18] payment rails in in Bitcoin is that that
[39:20] Network effect already so big that like
[39:23] it has to be lightning or is there still
[39:25] like room for other layer tools yeah I
[39:27] think there's a lot of room for other
[39:28] layer twos depending on what it is
[39:30] people want to do and what their needs
[39:32] are and what their what their trade-offs
[39:34] are so I think we might even see a
[39:37] situation where a lot of other layer
[39:39] twos or ecash or other things like that
[39:43] become uh very popular and dominant for
[39:46] a number of years and then when you get
[39:49] to that point where there's just much
[39:50] much more people that are interacting
[39:52] with Bitcoin in some way then the that
[39:54] effect that strong Network effect of
[39:56] lightning I think might actually kick in
[39:59] Beyond just the you know core of really
[40:01] committed early adopters that you have
[40:02] the general public saying oh yeah this
[40:04] is just this is actually easier since
[40:06] I'm you know I I'm spending money
[40:09] roughly equivalent to what I'm being
[40:11] paid and I'm getting money in and out in
[40:14] SATs I think that really works a lot um
[40:16] but one of the things I think that will
[40:18] really help with with lightning adoption
[40:20] is helping letting people not denominate
[40:23] in Bitcoins if they can actually send
[40:25] and receive on the lightning Network and
[40:27] have their their number of SATs
[40:29] fluctuate but their number of dollars or
[40:32] local currency um stable or relatively
[40:35] stable that really helps with adoption
[40:38] you know then they can ease their way
[40:40] into it they don't have to have a new
[40:42] payment system and a new kind of money
[40:44] and you know a new uh uh chart to watch
[40:47] all at the same time they can just take
[40:49] one piece and then maybe they can switch
[40:52] it to you know 10% Bitcoin 90% synthetic
[40:56] dollars and slowly turn that dial as
[40:59] their risk tolerance allows or as their
[41:01] preferences allow or as more people
[41:03] around them are switching over um and uh
[41:08] it it's actually a little sad to see
[41:10] there's there's been a couple of
[41:11] projects um in the past year that have
[41:13] shut down that were really good there
[41:15] was one project that was essentially
[41:17] trying to build a lightning wallet uh
[41:19] like this of that form where you could
[41:22] um in a decentralized way adjust your
[41:25] exposure to to bitcoin the dollar um and
[41:29] I think that there's this big demand to
[41:33] educate the general public on the basics
[41:35] of Bitcoin but I also feel there's a
[41:37] need to educate bitcoiners on some of
[41:40] the really cool things that have been
[41:41] built or should be built in Bitcoin and
[41:44] why why they're important why that will
[41:46] help with adoption um that you if you
[41:50] want to replace the banking system you
[41:52] need to actually replace the different
[41:55] parts of it not just the not just the
[41:57] money part that's a big fun and it's
[42:00] also this real world use cases make a
[42:03] huge difference in your head when you
[42:05] already see like oh that that's actually
[42:07] a good thing that is happening in
[42:09] Bitcoin and Bitcoin makes it so much
[42:11] easier to use for example um I mentioned
[42:14] before sponsor one of them is is based
[42:17] in America we first wanted to actually
[42:19] figure out how to do the Fiat payment uh
[42:22] and and he was like oh like give me this
[42:24] give me this give me this and I'm like I
[42:26] have to have to give a lot like I have
[42:28] to give a lot of information there's a
[42:29] lot like routing numbers all those
[42:31] things involved in that between America
[42:33] and Austria uh and then I was like can
[42:36] we just do it in Bitcoin and he was like
[42:39] okay let's just do it in Bitcoin uh and
[42:42] it was so easy we we did it on a Sunday
[42:45] afternoon and it was done in 20 minutes
[42:49] the whole process of switching do let's
[42:51] not do it in Fe let's do it in Bitcoin I
[42:53] set I up everything on my side he said
[42:56] everything up on his side uh and I
[42:59] didn't have to get it in my bank account
[43:01] which would have taken a few business
[43:02] days then would have gotten the money
[43:05] from the bank account do the exchange
[43:07] then from The Exchange to my wallet uh
[43:10] no I just like directly do the do the
[43:12] wallet and it's like wow that's that's
[43:14] that's amazing yeah so there's there's
[43:16] plenty of cases where paying with
[43:18] Bitcoin is so much so much better uh
[43:21] again in in the basement bar in Ria laia
[43:24] just okay done okay what's the local
[43:27] currency of Lafia don't know doesn't
[43:29] matter right what country am I in I
[43:31] don't care um it's it's kind of
[43:33] beautiful say oh no I'm going a Bitcoin
[43:35] place I can spend Bitcoin um you know
[43:38] hey this is somebody said something
[43:39] clever on Noster okay just send him 100
[43:42] SATs right um and trying to figure out
[43:45] how to how to send 100 the equivalent of
[43:48] 100 SATs to somebody through the
[43:49] traditional Financial system when you
[43:51] don't know uh you know what country
[43:52] they're even in um that's that's a big
[43:54] problem right it's either more difficult
[43:57] or costly or impossible um so I I'm a
[44:01] big fan of using Bitcoin when it when it
[44:03] makes sense like that but there are
[44:05] certain things where it Bitcoin payments
[44:07] are are not the right solution or it's
[44:09] not ready so for example if I'm
[44:11] traveling and I want to rent a car for a
[44:13] few
[44:14] days um renting car with my credit card
[44:16] makes a lot of sense it already includes
[44:18] some some coverage and no additional
[44:21] cost to
[44:22] me and uh I don't have to put a lot of
[44:26] money I don't have to send the person a
[44:28] lot of money right and they don't have
[44:30] to 100% trust me either so when I you
[44:34] know show them my credit card then they
[44:36] can charge me more money later if I've
[44:38] somehow damaged the car or whatever
[44:40] right but then there's also a dispute
[44:42] process built in where I can say hey no
[44:44] there there wasn't damage and I have
[44:45] video and I know reverse charges if
[44:48] necessary um there there just isn't
[44:50] something like that for Bitcoin right
[44:52] now and you could build that right but
[44:55] uh it hasn't really been built and then
[44:58] again the steps are you have to come up
[44:59] with an idea that makes sense you have
[45:01] to build it you have to polish it and
[45:03] you have to get it out there and get
[45:05] people using it right so we're we're a
[45:07] long ways away from enough people
[45:09] wanting to rent a car with Bitcoin that
[45:12] someone's going to build that and have
[45:13] it ready to go so that's why I I think
[45:16] it makes sense to use the right tool for
[45:18] the job right like the the joke you know
[45:20] someone gets a hammer and they run
[45:21] around looking for things to to hammer
[45:24] with it right that's not the right
[45:25] approach right usually you want to start
[45:27] with a problem and then say what's
[45:28] what's tool is the right solution not I
[45:31] have a I have a tool where are my
[45:34] problems um but it is tempting because
[45:36] you get excited about Bitcoin because
[45:37] Bitcoin is pretty amazing um but I am
[45:41] definitely a fan of using the the right
[45:42] tool for the job whether that's Bitcoin
[45:44] a local you know fiat currency or a
[45:47] credit card yeah it's also it's a little
[45:50] bit how I see do with spending Bitcoin
[45:52] right now especially in AUST because
[45:53] there like a
[45:55] 27.5% uh capital gains tax on them if
[45:58] you bought them uh after February 2021
[46:02] if you are lucky enough to B bought
[46:04] Bitcoin before that they're completely
[46:06] taxfree uh for Austrian folks out there
[46:09] that bought Bitcoin before that you can
[46:11] actually spend them taxfree um but for
[46:14] other than they like yeah they they they
[46:16] have Bitcoin they really desperately
[46:18] want to spend them uh because they have
[46:20] want to have that feeling and that's
[46:22] it's great like if if you want to do
[46:23] that and contribute to the network in in
[46:25] in that way but it's like running run
[46:27] around with the hammer and and searching
[46:28] for a solution when you have feed in
[46:30] your bank account and just use that
[46:32] money to spend and use your Bitcoin as a
[46:34] store of value right and um as you
[46:38] mentioned before right there are people
[46:39] who are trying to be all in on bitcoin
[46:41] they're trying to be on their own
[46:42] personal Bitcoin standard the issue is
[46:45] that if you go to 100% Bitcoin and you
[46:47] have no local fiat currency no credit
[46:49] card no bank account it in a lot of
[46:51] societies it's hard to function right
[46:53] it's hard to rent an apartment hard to
[46:56] buy a car hard hard to buy a house or or
[46:59] or really a lot of things um it's
[47:02] different if you're living in some
[47:04] Bitcoin jungle somewhere but uh but much
[47:08] easier is for someone to say okay well
[47:10] I'm going to have you know whatever 90%
[47:12] money in Bitcoin and then keep the
[47:13] reigning 10% in Fiat keep the bank
[47:15] accounts and so on for the time being or
[47:17] at least in the US they can use a credit
[47:19] union which is like a you know better
[47:22] than a bank in some ways um and uh or if
[47:26] they're or if they insist on being 100%
[47:28] Bitcoin you can be net 100% Bitcoin so
[47:31] you could have you know basic basically
[47:34] borrow some money and then you know you
[47:35] can have even more Bitcoin and you have
[47:38] debt and then you have operating cash so
[47:41] you have operating cash you can still be
[47:42] in the system but your your debt in
[47:45] dollars or Euros exceeds the actual
[47:48] balance you're keeping so your your net
[47:50] exposure is is negative or zero to the
[47:54] Fiat system while you're still able to
[47:56] use it for purposes as you need um so I
[48:00] think that you know that can make more
[48:02] sense in someone trying to just be
[48:04] purely Bitcoin at this point in time um
[48:06] but that's more an ideological thing
[48:08] right because if you're very bullish on
[48:10] bitcoin it doesn't really matter whether
[48:12] you're 80% 90% or 100% in it in in that
[48:16] sense right if you think you know if
[48:17] you're that bullish on bitcoin then what
[48:20] you know then you're just being greedy
[48:22] at that point let other people get a
[48:24] little Bitcoin too yeah don't take it
[48:27] all the not not not all the Bitcoin
[48:30] should go to mic sa yeah and of course
[48:33] it's much healthier if you have a market
[48:34] where you know 90% of the population is
[48:37] 1% of their wealth in Bitcoin versus 1%
[48:41] of the population is 90% of their wealth
[48:43] in Bitcoin right you want you want that
[48:45] broader base not only just for you know
[48:48] the politicians to realize that it's
[48:50] it's important and you know and that
[48:53] kind of thing and have favorable laws
[48:55] but also because it just results in much
[48:58] more stable system right you have a lot
[49:00] of people a few people who are very
[49:02] Overexposed it's easy for them to get
[49:04] squeezed out or be financially pressured
[49:06] I I mean I even worried about some of
[49:08] the these conferences it's like okay
[49:10] this 50,000 bitcoiners showing up and
[49:13] you know this is going to cost everyone
[49:14] thousands of dollars in airfare and
[49:16] hotel rooms and so on if they're selling
[49:17] Bitcoin for this you know we're we're
[49:19] creating our own bare Market here you
[49:21] know we we could have just we could have
[49:23] just used Zoom or you know or just not
[49:25] have the conference somewhere more
[49:26] expensive have it a have it at um an
[49:29] airport hotel you know in uh some some
[49:32] cheap uh cheap area but then know Donald
[49:36] Trump and all the mainstream celebrities
[49:38] would show up uh then we can discuss if
[49:41] that's a good thing or bad thing for
[49:42] conferences but yeah like well well that
[49:44] that's true right and I think that um
[49:46] it's good that the Bitcoin magazine
[49:47] conference has gone back to to moving it
[49:49] around because then you have it in
[49:51] different places and um it it has
[49:54] certain certain benefits for new people
[49:56] to get to it now it's their local
[49:58] conference but also um an opportunity
[50:00] for for local politicians or other
[50:03] people to to show up and then realize
[50:05] that there is a pretty significant group
[50:08] of people who are passionate about this
[50:10] and there isn't a
[50:12] corresponding large group of people that
[50:14] are passionately against it so it's it's
[50:17] really just uh it's upside to to want to
[50:21] support something that's the
[50:23] future I like the the the the way you
[50:26] look at uh leave some Bitcoin for other
[50:29] people because I think but I'm joking
[50:31] because of course you can't you can't
[50:32] you know no no matter how much Bitcoin
[50:34] you take then there's still enough value
[50:36] for other people yeah yeah yeah
[50:37] absolutely and uh but it's an
[50:40] interesting mindset because I think most
[50:43] bitcoiners actually have fear of missing
[50:46] out completely when they have Bitcoin
[50:48] like they are like uh oh I have to have
[50:50] more Bitcoin you always have this fear
[50:51] of like not having enough Bitcoin no
[50:53] matter what the ENT is someone with zero
[50:57] 0.001 Bitcoin has probably the same fear
[50:59] as someone with like 10 Bitcoin uh which
[51:02] is like completely out of the scales um
[51:05] but it's it's interesting that that we
[51:07] we have that fear of missing out because
[51:09] oh now now maybe now the the Bull Run
[51:11] starts and we are tomorrow at
[51:13] 600,000 yeah and that can be the case
[51:17] where again things can go sideways for a
[51:19] very long time and then then go vertical
[51:22] right it doesn't have to uh cooperate
[51:24] with you in terms of what what you want
[51:26] sure
[51:28] um um and again yeah you do the
[51:31] calculation of okay well 21 million
[51:33] Bitcoin divided by 8 billion people and
[51:35] that's
[51:36] 0. wait what you know so um you know if
[51:40] you have whatever if someone says they
[51:42] have you know $1,000 in Bitcoin now they
[51:45] already have more than their fair share
[51:49] um but but it's also so I mean they
[51:53] should feel good in terms of okay they
[51:54] have more than their fair share but also
[51:57] have some real realistic assumptions
[52:00] about what that could be worth right
[52:02] because while there's no limit in in
[52:05] just pure Fiat terms right that that
[52:07] doesn't mean that doesn't mean anything
[52:09] right the question is how much food can
[52:11] you buy how much fuel can you buy how
[52:12] much energy can you buy with a certain
[52:14] amount of Bitcoin uh because again right
[52:17] the you know you you can go around you
[52:18] can go out and buy the hundred trillion
[52:20] dollar Zimbabwe note right now right and
[52:22] you can say you're
[52:23] trillionaire um but that doesn't that
[52:25] you know that those those numbers are
[52:27] not helpful so I like to put it in terms
[52:30] of like acres of land right Acres of
[52:32] usable land is something that's scarce
[52:35] you can't just snap your fingers and say
[52:37] okay I just made lots more usable land
[52:40] um so if you look at it now uh there's
[52:43] this you know website I was looking at
[52:44] in the US where they have listings you
[52:46] can buy 10,000 acres of um usable land
[52:49] somewhere and it's it's quite expensive
[52:52] right and um you can say well there's
[52:54] only 21 million Bitcoin well there's not
[52:57] that many Parcels of 10,000 acres of
[52:59] land so so there is some there is some
[53:03] upper limit to the you know purchasing
[53:05] power of Bitcoin um and I don't want to
[53:08] rain on people's parade but it's it's
[53:11] there somewhere right you can always say
[53:12] some Fiat number okay sure it eventually
[53:14] reach that but is a Bitcoin going to be
[53:16] worth more than 10,000 acres of land I
[53:19] don't think so not
[53:20] ever and that's okay right that's
[53:22] there's still there's still you know
[53:24] room to run there but you've just
[53:27] established some reasonable upper bound
[53:29] where if someone thinks they have
[53:31] 0.00001 Bitcoin that's going to you know
[53:33] make them super rich in some future
[53:35] world I I really don't think so but it's
[53:38] better it's definitely better to be off
[53:39] zero yeah it's it's interesting because
[53:42] basically every price prediction will be
[53:45] probably true at some point uh
[53:47] especially when the fiat currency
[53:49] completely goes away then at least at
[53:50] some point you will hit all those $1
[53:52] billion dollar per bitcoin price targets
[53:55] that seem completely Outland now but
[53:57] it's way more interesting to compare it
[53:59] to gold and real estate that's like an
[54:02] acres of land like those things is is
[54:04] for me the most interesting way to
[54:07] measure Bitcoin in because even like
[54:09] gold is kind of the the the the the
[54:12] longest running oldest sound money asset
[54:16] uh and it kind of makes sense for me to
[54:18] to measure Bitcoin in in in gold and
[54:21] right now uh a kilo price of one gold uh
[54:24] is like 75,000 I think the last time I I
[54:27] I looked maybe I'm completely off but I
[54:29] think it was like 75,000 for 1 kilogram
[54:31] of of cold uh it's it's funny enough
[54:35] quite uh quite um close enough to
[54:39] bitcoin one Bitcoin price is one
[54:41] kilogram of gold um so when you look at
[54:45] those proportions of those like okay
[54:48] what what will like 0.1 Bitcoin actually
[54:50] mean what will one Bitcoin actually mean
[54:53] in a Bitcoin world when we think of like
[54:55] Bitcoin is actually successful as like
[54:58] most people have it as a store of value
[55:01] most people uh transact with it like
[55:03] it's a it's like it's the main currency
[55:05] that most people on Earth use it that
[55:07] that hyper Bitcoin say hyper Bitcoin
[55:10] size world do you have some framework
[55:12] around like okay what will like an acre
[55:15] of land cost in in in Bitcoin what will
[55:18] like a piece of of gold cost like in
[55:20] Bitcoin yeah I I don't I don't have a
[55:23] prediction on that I'm just trying to
[55:25] look at what a reasonable up or back B
[55:26] is so if someone says okay you know
[55:28] Bitcoin all Bitcoin equals the market
[55:31] cap of gold for example okay that that's
[55:33] a reasonable thing to say and then you
[55:36] can look at how much gold that
[55:37] corresponds to right whether it's you
[55:39] know maybe it's one one Bitcoin equals
[55:41] one good delivery bar of gold right the
[55:43] 400 ounces
[55:46] um uh but then people can also make the
[55:49] case that you know Bitcoin will be worth
[55:51] more than gold and you can say well okay
[55:53] maybe gold loses some some of its appeal
[55:55] as a store value um because it certainly
[55:58] has that right if you look at say the
[56:00] gold price versus the Platinum um price
[56:04] over you know over the last 20 years
[56:06] right they used to they used to have
[56:07] some correlation but really Platinum has
[56:09] just completely flatlined uh over many
[56:12] many years while while gold is actually
[56:14] hitting new all-time highs now um simply
[56:17] because Platinum Platinum platinum's
[56:19] rarer than gold right and we also don't
[56:22] have a way to just snap our fingers and
[56:23] make it um and
[56:27] it's just that uh you know gold is seen
[56:29] as the store value metal um so the
[56:31] premium goes there um so these people
[56:35] speculate that gold could lose its
[56:36] premium but also there's you can make a
[56:38] case that Bitcoin will become more
[56:39] valuable than gold because of its
[56:41] digital nature if you imagine a world to
[56:44] say okay there's 8 billion people but
[56:46] there's going to be 100 billion robots
[56:48] running around right maybe they're tiny
[56:51] drones or whatever they don't have to be
[56:52] humanoid robots but they're going to
[56:55] spend Bitcoin right they're not not
[56:56] going to be spending gold coins or or
[56:58] you know whatever fiat currency is
[57:00] available then you could make a case
[57:02] that there's there's an even bigger
[57:03] Market that doesn't exist yet just like
[57:06] you know Uber you know had that that POS
[57:09] that potential to take more than the
[57:10] existing taxi markets by being so much
[57:12] more convenient and that someone would
[57:14] be like yeah I'm going to use this to
[57:15] commute to work you know I'm going to
[57:17] you know take this all over the place as
[57:18] opposed to like having to make a phone
[57:20] call and tell someone your address and
[57:22] then you know hope they show up that
[57:25] kind of thing so it potten you could
[57:26] potentially expand the market further um
[57:30] but again with with a lot of these uh
[57:33] you know bitcoin price models they're
[57:35] not even specifying are they talking
[57:37] about you know absolute dollars right
[57:39] you're talking about just the just the
[57:41] nominal number you're talking about it
[57:42] fixed by a certain year you know I mean
[57:44] what about what happens with with uh
[57:46] that policy um and you know again the
[57:50] supply is the supply is important only
[57:53] as long as it's not too crazy right and
[57:56] um you know we we've seen there's a lot
[57:59] of different currencies both
[58:01] cryptocurrencies and regular that
[58:03] there's there's some leeway with the
[58:05] Supply right you can have a situation
[58:06] where maybe the supply goes up a little
[58:08] maybe it goes down a little maybe it
[58:09] goes up a bit more and that doesn't have
[58:11] as much an impact on the price of things
[58:13] as people think it's only when their
[58:15] supply is really just increasing too
[58:17] much that the value is diluted and
[58:20] things collapse um so it's it's it's
[58:23] always been more about the demand it's
[58:26] very much about the demand and um
[58:28] bitcoin's biggest price increases in
[58:31] relative terms were when the the
[58:34] inflation rate and the monetary
[58:35] inflation rate of Bitcoin was super high
[58:37] when Bitcoin had a monetary inflation
[58:39] rate over 10% that was when Bitcoin was
[58:41] making these huge gains and it was
[58:44] because you had even bigger gains than
[58:46] the demand for
[58:48] it um so that's really going to be the
[58:51] driving Factor going forward the the
[58:56] and it's a matter of okay how many how
[58:58] many people are adopting this uh as a
[59:00] store of value and how many people are
[59:01] adopting it for other purposes it will
[59:05] be really interesting to see uh I like
[59:07] it um one last part that I want to get
[59:10] in the in the podcast also as you a
[59:13] long-term hler already and I'm aware
[59:15] that at every uh Bitcoin conversation
[59:18] there are some new people listening
[59:21] there's someone that maybe just found a
[59:22] Bitcoin video and it's maybe like in his
[59:25] first like one maybe even three four
[59:28] Bitcoin Bitcoin videos um what are some
[59:32] of the lessons you have learned uh some
[59:35] things that you um some of the mistakes
[59:38] maybe you have made that you don't want
[59:40] to repeat or early people that are now
[59:43] in there they should not
[59:46] do um yeah then the number one mistake
[59:50] um that I and other people have made
[59:52] right is simply giving your Bitcoins to
[59:55] somebody else letting somebody else hold
[59:56] your keys for whatever reason whether
[59:59] it's because it's it's an exchange uh
[60:02] where you want to trade it or because it
[60:04] you know seems to be earning yield from
[60:06] nowhere or uh that you know you think
[60:08] that they might be able to store it more
[60:10] securely than you can um that's that's
[60:13] one of the biggest things that leads to
[60:15] people simply not getting their Bitcoins
[60:17] back right and if you don't get your
[60:18] Bitcoins back does it really matter why
[60:21] right whether they lost it or they
[60:22] choose not to give it back to you or was
[60:24] hacked whether it inside job or external
[60:26] threat doesn't it doesn't matter right
[60:29] or maybe there's a you know
[60:30] controversial fork and they the
[60:33] custodian has decided to give you back
[60:34] the fourth coins because they believe
[60:36] those are the real Bitcoin and they
[60:37] don't give you back the real Bitcoin um
[60:40] there's a lot of ways it can go wrong
[60:41] including ways you don't anticipate and
[60:44] remember that you also have to
[60:45] authenticate yourself to the custodian
[60:48] and ultimately there's no better way to
[60:49] authenticate yourself then by signing a
[60:51] message with private
[60:53] Keys uh so so you know two Factor
[60:56] authentication a p login a password
[60:59] email those are all not as good as just
[61:02] keeping private Keys private and siging
[61:05] a message with them and if you can do
[61:06] that then you can hold your Bitcoin um
[61:10] it's also important to make sure you
[61:11] have a proper backup and you want to
[61:14] think about different threat models
[61:16] different ways things can go wrong right
[61:18] what if there's a a natural disaster in
[61:20] your area right are the backups right
[61:22] next to you know Hardware wallets and
[61:24] your computer or cell phone right right
[61:26] um what you know what does it look like
[61:29] if uh you know whatever you you go
[61:31] through a divorce or you know or you
[61:34] know family member develops a gambling
[61:36] problem right you have to think about
[61:38] your you know whether those Bitcoins are
[61:40] secure in those situations you also want
[61:42] to make sure you have enough Bitcoin
[61:44] that it you know you'll actually be
[61:46] happy if the price goes up in the future
[61:48] as opposed to angry uh but you don't
[61:50] want so many Bitcoin that you'll be
[61:51] forced to sell out if the price drops or
[61:54] there's an unexpected bare Market
[61:56] because you know you could say like oh
[61:59] man you know if I if I bought Bitcoins
[62:01] at this price they're like okay but the
[62:02] next thing that happened was the price
[62:03] dropped 85% all right um if you look at
[62:06] uh like Tim Draper uh you know bought uh
[62:09] I believe it was 30,000 Bitcoins at
[62:12] $600 and the next thing that happened
[62:14] was the price dropped
[62:17] 75% and uh you know people wanted to be
[62:20] like ha idiot you know you must feel
[62:24] pretty stupid you spent all this money
[62:25] and you know you're down million
[62:26] millions of dollars right and he's like
[62:28] no this is a long-term purchase and it
[62:31] was right and now in retrospect he's you
[62:33] know he looks pretty good buying this
[62:35] Bitcoin at $600 even if it went to 150
[62:38] first but if he was forced to sell at
[62:41] 150 then it was all for nothing you know
[62:44] then the Bitcoins are gone the loss is
[62:46] locked in and then he just gets to watch
[62:49] the train leave without
[62:52] him um and yeah uh I think as Matt Odell
[62:56] says you know stay humble stack SATs
[62:59] right it's important not to think you're
[63:01] you know too clever or whatever you
[63:02] figured out something else or to to brag
[63:05] about what you've done is is a bad idea
[63:08] for for a lot of reasons um it's easy
[63:10] for people to you know start thinking
[63:12] they're they're a genius right as I say
[63:15] everyone thinks they're a genius in a
[63:16] bull market um and make some kind of
[63:19] mistake um and uh you know to be aware
[63:23] of uh of one's emotions right that it's
[63:25] okay to experience fear and greed but to
[63:27] not let them you know make the decisions
[63:30] for you I think those are those are
[63:32] great Point let's me to one more
[63:34] question um that I have a lot Bitcoin
[63:37] are quite unique characters right now
[63:40] yeah what if Bitcoin is actually
[63:42] successful how does the world look like
[63:44] when all those bitcoiners who actually
[63:46] held and have those mindsets on those
[63:48] unique characters are then uh the the
[63:52] the elite and then are the the big money
[63:54] givers uh in trophy in like charity and
[63:58] all those things what can that change in
[64:00] in in the world yeah I I think that
[64:03] actually could have a strong positive
[64:05] effect um there was a uh a bitcoiner
[64:08] whose identity is unknown who created
[64:10] the pineapple fund with 5,000 Bitcoins
[64:13] and uh they actually solicited comments
[64:15] for you know hey what what should I fund
[64:17] with this that would have the most
[64:18] benefit for Humanity um and they ended
[64:21] up funding a lot of uh different
[64:23] interesting projects that that might not
[64:25] have gotten that level of money or
[64:27] interest otherwise um I think it will it
[64:29] will be pretty neat to see what some
[64:32] some bit coiners can do at some point in
[64:34] time uh in terms of funding new kinds of
[64:36] research or or AI or or building tools
[64:40] uh people need right right now a lot of
[64:42] the apps people rely on for common
[64:44] day-to-day things are are run by
[64:46] for-profit companies and sometimes those
[64:49] companies have goals that are at odds
[64:51] with with with the users um so there's a
[64:54] lot of opportunities for someone to to
[64:55] build like nonprofit versions of these
[64:58] these apps that are not trying to
[65:00] extract the value but rather give it
[65:01] back to the users um things like that
[65:03] right the the people who made money from
[65:05] WhatsApp then you know turned around and
[65:06] created signal for example so there you
[65:09] could you could see a lot of things like
[65:10] that um and of course the people who you
[65:13] know might not know what to do with the
[65:15] money right so and and that's okay right
[65:18] they can leave it to children or they
[65:20] might see you know other bitcoiners and
[65:23] might say hey these are these are things
[65:24] you can do this is what other people are
[65:26] doing that's uh beneficial for Humanity
[65:29] and you can do it as well um but you
[65:32] know again the good thing with Bitcoin
[65:33] is if someone has a bunch of Bitcoin
[65:36] they can either spend it or not those
[65:38] are basically the options right they
[65:40] can't just uh you know have unlimited
[65:43] money flowing in from it in perpetuity
[65:46] like uh you know aristocratic land grant
[65:48] or or something um they uh you know so
[65:52] either either you know they they don't
[65:54] spend it or or they do and if they spend
[65:56] it then it's gone and um it just goes to
[66:00] other people and and circulates I think
[66:02] that's also a great point because a lot
[66:04] of people think oh like there are those
[66:05] then those those rich people in Bitcoin
[66:08] but they eventually have to either spend
[66:10] it or they they will die with it or they
[66:13] give it the the grand the the kids and
[66:15] they will spend it like it it comes in a
[66:17] natural flow and it's not like feeld
[66:19] where you can make yield on your money
[66:23] uh without having uh something something
[66:25] off like like there's there's no not
[66:27] this rent seeking on top of Bitcoin yeah
[66:30] and there's a there's a faction of
[66:32] bitcoiners that I call them medieval
[66:35] peasants that for some reason they they
[66:38] uh I don't know they they like the
[66:40] futuristic Bitcoin but then everything
[66:42] else that they like things how they were
[66:44] hundreds of years ago or seem to think
[66:46] that's better so so maybe they're going
[66:48] to commission some beautiful buildings
[66:50] in the style of 500 or 700 years ago and
[66:53] uh you know that's great if that's uh
[66:55] that's what they want to do right but
[66:57] I'm I'm more interested to see uh what
[67:00] what people could do in terms of you
[67:02] know uh rocket ships and exploring other
[67:03] planets and um you know Robotics and
[67:06] Automation and and that kind of thing
[67:09] okay last question uh will will Bitcoin
[67:11] be a
[67:13] multiplanetary uh currency one day is is
[67:15] Bitcoin possible ready for that when we
[67:18] have some uptips
[67:20] maybe I mean I you know I'd like to see
[67:22] that right but uh some people have done
[67:24] done the analysis in terms of um can you
[67:27] really mine across different different
[67:29] planets with the with the delays of
[67:32] getting uh the signal between there you
[67:33] know you're limited by the speed of
[67:35] light so it might not be that easy to
[67:37] stay in sync with that so maybe people
[67:39] could uh you know could transact but
[67:42] there there would be some you know
[67:43] element of uh trust there um or or maybe
[67:48] you know once uh once you have different
[67:50] planets that are populated
[67:52] they'll you know they'll want some
[67:53] degree of Independence maybe they will
[67:55] want to do something
[67:56] different we'll find out oh really cool
[67:59] perfect and the end routine of the uh
[68:01] podcast that is new uh like not new for
[68:04] the listeners but new for you as a guest
[68:07] is what can we learn from you besides
[68:10] all the things that we already talked
[68:11] about besides Bitcoin uh what can we
[68:13] learn from

[68:17] interested in a lot of different topics
[68:19] right so uh I'm also happy to to talk
[68:22] about AI actually going into some of the
[68:25] the details on that uh as well as
[68:28] Futures and options and derivatives and
[68:30] commodities markets um so you know those
[68:34] are those are really interesting to me
[68:35] as well and happy to talk about those
[68:38] really really cool thank you so much um
