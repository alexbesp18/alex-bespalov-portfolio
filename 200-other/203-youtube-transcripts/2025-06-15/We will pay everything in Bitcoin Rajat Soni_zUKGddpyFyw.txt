[00:00] our kids are probably never going to
[00:01] experience the banking system more and
[00:03] more of it going to come off the
[00:04] exchanges people are going to be paying
[00:06] others for their goods and services in
[00:07] Bitcoin it's a complete Paradigm Shift
[00:09] once you see that Fiat is a Ponzi scheme
[00:11] it completely changes your mind Bitcoin
[00:12] does exactly what it's supposed to do at
[00:14] block 840,000 the supply decreases from
[00:17] 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125 bitcoin with no
[00:20] regulation no regulating party no
[00:22] government nobody in the middle nobody
[00:24] forcing it to happen it'll show people
[00:26] that this is doing exactly what it's
[00:28] meant to do and it'll prompt more people
[00:30] to put 1 to 5 to 10% of their portfolio
[00:33] into something they can
[00:34] trust I saw in your Twitter handle the
[00:38] CFA uh attack and that you have like a
[00:41] history in the traditional Financial
[00:43] system and uh before I go into my first
[00:47] actual question I just want to quickly
[00:49] know what is a CFA I learned it's like a
[00:52] charted financial analyst um is it bad
[00:55] that I don't know about it and uh what
[00:58] what what is that I mean to be honest I
[01:01] feel like
[01:02] the the CFA doesn't have doesn't really
[01:05] have anything to do with Bitcoin it's
[01:07] more like uh I mean for me it was more
[01:09] about building the mindset that I could
[01:11] do whatever I wanted right I mean not
[01:13] everybody needs to know what the CFA is
[01:15] not everybody needs to know what the CPA
[01:16] is you don't necessarily need to know or
[01:20] have a finance background to be a
[01:24] bitcoiner right I I think some of the
[01:26] smartest bitcoiners are actually have no
[01:28] Finance background so it's perfectly
[01:30] fine that you don't know this and what's
[01:33] what's the CFA is it like an exam you
[01:36] can take and then you have like certain
[01:38] Financial um skills or like Financial
[01:44] yeah yeah so it's a it's the chartered
[01:46] financial analyst uh it's essentially a
[01:50] ex it's a series of exams three exams
[01:52] that test you on different parts of the
[01:55] financial um I guess financial planning
[01:59] kind of route so teach they ask you not
[02:01] really financial planning but financial
[02:03] asset evaluation analyst anal an just
[02:07] just making decisions that kind of thing
[02:09] I think that's the the main thing that
[02:11] it it helps with um it teaches you how
[02:14] to do certain calculations how to Value
[02:16] things how to look a little deeper I
[02:19] guess how to understand things at a at a
[02:22] more a deeper level did this help you uh
[02:26] in understanding
[02:28] Bitcoin def
[02:30] I think I mean it was there was a part
[02:34] of it that had nothing to do with
[02:35] Bitcoin of course but there was
[02:38] uh it definitely helped my understanding
[02:40] because now I mean after I understood
[02:43] how stock the stock market works why
[02:44] people use the stock market the bond
[02:47] market I feel like Bitcoin just put it
[02:49] all together kind of thing right um it
[02:52] the CFA doesn't really consider that we
[02:54] could use anything other than the US
[02:56] dollar as money which is kind of or well
[02:58] not the US dollar but fat currencies we
[03:00] don't really go into anything else right
[03:02] we don't go into going back to the gold
[03:04] standard it's just a commodity it's just
[03:06] something there's nothing about what
[03:08] money is right so I think I think
[03:10] learning about Bitcoin just put all of
[03:11] that together it showed me why do people
[03:14] even have to invest in the first place
[03:17] yeah it's fascinating that H so many
[03:19] people in the financial system that are
[03:22] really deep into uh trading they're
[03:25] really deep into finding value into
[03:27] things and investing in companies is
[03:29] investing in in headphones they're
[03:31] managing stuff and they never ask
[03:34] themselves the question what is money
[03:36] actually I see a lot of experts or
[03:39] analysts or financial uh manager and
[03:43] advisors that have no clue what money
[03:46] actually is and where it's coming from
[03:48] and you have a really interesting long
[03:50] history in that traditional Financial
[03:53] system if I can say that um how uh
[03:57] different was your view before Bitcoin
[03:59] coin or were you already in the Bitcoin
[04:02] mindset and just discovered Bitcoin then
[04:04] no it was completely different I I was
[04:06] keep in mind I was always surrounded by
[04:08] uh stocks uh bonds yield dividends
[04:13] rental income I was actually a realtor
[04:15] before before I so I I was working at at
[04:20] one of the big banks in Canada as a as a
[04:22] bond analyst and I left in 2021 to to do
[04:27] my real estate license so I got my real
[04:29] estate license I did pretty well in the
[04:30] first year um but I didn't really like
[04:35] it I guess after after I after I started
[04:37] really thinking about how Bitcoin Works
[04:41] how it's uh a way to save without having
[04:44] to buy something like real estate to
[04:46] save value right real estate is it
[04:48] should be used as a house right you
[04:50] should people shouldn't be be a the
[04:51] people shouldn't be using real estate as
[04:54] uh a savings tool because it's not
[04:56] savings right real estate is it has
[04:58] utility people need it to survive it's
[05:00] one of the basic needs of of human
[05:03] beings right so the fact that people are
[05:05] using real estate I mean I was part of
[05:08] the system where I was a realtor people
[05:10] were using real estate as an investment
[05:13] they're taking demand oh sorry they're
[05:14] taking Supply off the market they're
[05:16] increasing demand they're increasing
[05:18] prices it's leading to more and more
[05:20] people being left behind right Our
[05:23] Generations I'm 31 how old are you if
[05:25] you don't mind me asking uh 25 25 okay
[05:28] so I've spoken to people in your gener
[05:30] in your not your I guess are you gen
[05:33] Z I actually don't know I think I'm in
[05:36] the on the edge of think I'm 1998 born
[05:40] uh so I'm on the verge of of two uh but
[05:44] yeah I think I'm CH C or close not
[05:47] cheni well both both of our Generations
[05:50] I mean most people don't don't think
[05:52] they can afford a house right if you
[05:53] speak to people they the majority don't
[05:57] feel like they can afford to buy some a
[05:59] place to live in so they're going to be
[06:00] renting forever and who owns all those
[06:02] properties right it's the older
[06:04] Generations most of them are owned by
[06:06] older Generations there are people who
[06:07] own thousands of houses right so I mean
[06:11] back to what I was talking about so as a
[06:12] realtor I was pretty much I was helping
[06:15] those convers I was I was telling people
[06:18] hey you should be buying real estate to
[06:19] store value because this is the best way
[06:21] to go now I mean I feel like it's once
[06:24] you understand Bitcoin it's kind
[06:26] of it goes against my morals to tell
[06:30] people hey you should continue buying
[06:31] real estate I mean I was making great
[06:33] money doing it I'm actually making less
[06:35] money now teaching about Bitcoin than I
[06:37] was when I was a realtor I mean I could
[06:39] continue being a realtor continue
[06:40] selling people rental properties but I
[06:43] choose not to because I don't feel like
[06:45] it's the right way to go for new people
[06:48] listening uh and and maybe it's like
[06:51] Bitcoin just in the starting of the
[06:53] rabbit hole why is um buying more and
[06:56] more real estate going against your
[06:59] morals and
[07:01] ethics well you're taking Supply off the
[07:03] off the market you're increasing prices
[07:05] anybody who doesn't own a house is being
[07:09] forced to pay higher and higher prices
[07:11] so there was uh there are some numbers
[07:13] where I was actually sorry one second I
[07:15] have it on my on my screen here there
[07:17] was uh uh have you seen that price chart
[07:19] for
[07:21] 1971 uh the from the website uh wdf
[07:26] happened in
[07:27] 9971 yeah that's
[07:30] a price TR it says a house is something
[07:32] like $25,000 or $23,000 and the average
[07:35] salary at the time was
[07:37] 10.5k so a house was 2.3 times the
[07:41] average salary today a house is probably
[07:45] 8 to 10 times the average
[07:47] salary right so prices will continue to
[07:50] go up right it'll keep going up and and
[07:52] the main reason for that is Demand right
[07:55] a lot of houses are held by people
[07:58] who are are renting them out and they'll
[08:00] continue increasing the price because
[08:01] they want the cash flow they want to
[08:03] hedge against inflation they want to
[08:05] maximize their profits as they maximize
[08:07] their profits the price rises in general
[08:10] right um I mean there are people who
[08:12] have full control of the market there
[08:14] there are people who have thousands of
[08:16] rental units and if they increase the
[08:17] price
[08:19] $20 they're making thousands more every
[08:23] month right so to them it's like okay
[08:26] this is more cash flow for me but they
[08:27] don't see that where increasing the
[08:30] price of rent for everybody so when it
[08:32] takes them out of the equation it just
[08:33] makes it easier for the people at the
[08:35] bottom to actually be able to access
[08:36] real estate I had yesterday an
[08:38] interesting conversation with Eric V uh
[08:41] the I don't know maybe you saw in on
[08:43] Twitter the the Cannabis farmer cool
[08:45] videos about Bitcoin and yesterday my
[08:48] 50th episode was with him uh on on
[08:50] bitcoin and we talked about the topic
[08:53] where when Bitcoin is sucking up more
[08:56] and more financial energy it
[08:59] automatically also drives down over the
[09:01] long run uh housing
[09:03] prices ba basically making housing more
[09:07] uh affordable and basically um driving
[09:11] homelessness uh slowly down with that uh
[09:15] um um mechanism do you agree with that
[09:19] yeah I mean Bitcoin is more profitable
[09:21] than renting out property so why not
[09:24] that's exactly what's going to happen I
[09:25] mean more properties are going to go on
[09:27] the
[09:28] market properties are going to be even
[09:30] larger properties like buildings are
[09:32] going to be sold for cheaper they're
[09:33] already being sold for cheaper right um
[09:36] think about how many commercial
[09:37] buildings have gone down in price there
[09:39] was a building that sold
[09:41] for um it was like $2.5 million if you
[09:44] replace that with a condo what's going
[09:46] to happen think about how much more
[09:48] Supply there is and you can easily do
[09:50] that right it's not it's not difficult
[09:52] you have to pay the the development cost
[09:54] of course but at the end of the day it's
[09:58] it's possible to be done maybe maybe
[10:01] people won't choose to do that if they
[10:03] don't want to me it is however they do
[10:05] it but yeah definitely prices will
[10:08] definitely go down prices because you
[10:10] can increase the supply at any point how
[10:11] did you come from uh this traditional
[10:14] mindset being a real estate uh realator
[10:18] the now you're in Bitcoin you have the
[10:20] bitcoiner mindset um how long was that
[10:23] period that switching period for you and
[10:25] like how did you come uh to the
[10:27] conclusion that Bitcoin as I hear it
[10:30] from you is the best way to store uh
[10:32] wealth I think it I think I've always
[10:34] kind of had this mindset I just didn't
[10:36] know Bitcoin existed I didn't understand
[10:38] what it was um keep in mind because I'm
[10:41] from because my parents are from India
[10:44] they have the saor mindset right they
[10:45] don't they don't think of investing as
[10:47] something that they should be doing um
[10:50] they in India or whenever back back
[10:54] whenever they were saving whenever they
[10:56] were younger their parents were saving
[10:59] in gold right so I mean I guess the
[11:02] belief now is that gold is valuable
[11:06] because it has certain properties right
[11:08] and people believe I I did some surveys
[11:11] a lot of people actually believe that US
[11:12] dollars are also backed by gold so I
[11:15] guess I think what Bitcoin does is when
[11:17] when you think about it US dollar saving
[11:19] in US Dollars and saving in Gold they
[11:21] eliminate risk most I think most people
[11:25] in the world in general don't want to
[11:27] take excess risk right they don't want
[11:29] to who can blame them right why would
[11:31] you want to work for something and then
[11:33] be willing to lose it on a gamble right
[11:38] at the end of the day stocks and real
[11:39] estate are gambles right Bitcoin I think
[11:42] competes with real uh it competes with
[11:45] gold and US dollars as a savings vehicle
[11:49] and I feel like that go that's very
[11:51] deeply rooted in my family's history
[11:54] right saving is is deeply rooted even
[11:56] investing in general it wasn't really
[11:59] a a big thing until maybe 200 years ago
[12:02] right you could invest in yourself but
[12:03] you're not going to be investing in
[12:04] multinational corporations or houses to
[12:07] rent out to whoever you can right I mean
[12:09] there were people who doing that but it
[12:10] wasn't as widely done as it is today
[12:13] right so I feel
[12:15] like the mindset changed because I saw
[12:19] that all of this cash flow all of this
[12:22] uh all of this rental income all of this
[12:25] interest income it's all fake it's all
[12:27] built on a fake form of money once you
[12:30] see
[12:30] that changes everything when I already
[12:33] had the Bitcoin mindset I just didn't
[12:34] know it existed so once I saw that I
[12:36] realized okay this is just completely
[12:39] the opposite of what we have
[12:41] today yeah it's it's it's uh funny
[12:44] because I always was also a complete
[12:46] saver I even like I remember when I was
[12:50] a small kid and my mom gave me like five
[12:52] for uh the the lunch uh time and I
[12:56] remember like buying two really good
[12:59] things with like four and now it's like
[13:01] I need to spend like five for one for
[13:04] one good thing uh and I remember where I
[13:07] every day I put something away I never
[13:10] used the whole five euros and this was
[13:14] through my whole life uh and when I came
[13:17] to the age of 18 19 I was like what do I
[13:21] do with the money because I did not know
[13:24] why it was de bleeding of financial
[13:26] energy but I had an an intrinsic feel
[13:28] feeling that it does nothing and it
[13:31] loses well loses value I had no clue
[13:34] about the monetary system but I kind of
[13:36] knew what's going on so I tried stocks
[13:39] investing I tried everything that's
[13:41] possible in the financial system with
[13:43] fonds with stocks I even thought about
[13:47] real estate but in the time where I
[13:49] thought about real estate I actually
[13:50] came to know about Bitcoin and I did
[13:54] really good and people are asking me oh
[13:56] how do you do that how do you do that
[13:58] and I came to know that the problem is
[14:00] not that people want to pick stocks and
[14:02] be a Financial Manager they want to just
[14:05] store and save their financial energy
[14:08] that they worked so hard for and it's
[14:11] interesting to see when uh people are
[14:14] finally getting Bitcoin they're like oh
[14:17] I just have to provide Society with a
[14:19] lot of value getting uh value then back
[14:24] and this value I can save in Bitcoin and
[14:27] that's it that's my financial strategy
[14:29] and that's the best strategy for you for
[14:31] the next 10 years yeah that's the entire
[14:34] retirement plan right add value consume
[14:38] less than you uh than you
[14:40] produce save the rest in Bitcoin I mean
[14:43] you could you could have an emergency
[14:44] fund you could maybe do something like
[14:47] um you could have I would I would person
[14:50] I don't sell insurance but I think term
[14:52] insurance is great because it gives you
[14:53] insurance for a certain period of time
[14:56] um other than that I mean I feel like
[14:57] that's the plan right so um spend less
[15:01] spend less than you earn save in Bitcoin
[15:03] buy insurance have an emergency fund it
[15:06] most people are good with that right
[15:07] most people don't need anything past
[15:09] that once you once you understand that
[15:12] you should be spending less become so
[15:14] easy was it was it a challenge for you
[15:17] to be uh Bitcoin only uh to be uh not um
[15:22] playing around with a lot of altcoins
[15:24] not playing around with other things I
[15:26] feel like a lot of bitcoiners going
[15:28] through the Journey they they discover
[15:30] Bitcoin then they're going to altcoins
[15:32] and then they're coming back to bitcoin
[15:34] because they discover oh it's actually
[15:36] only Bitcoin and especially people that
[15:38] are coming from the traditional
[15:40] Financial system I feel like they are
[15:43] more towards all have to diversify
[15:46] through different kinds of coins I I I
[15:50] see that a lot especially from stock
[15:52] investors that they are coming to
[15:54] bitcoin um how was your journey like did
[15:56] you were jumping to bitcoin only or you
[15:58] all some some alt
[16:01] coins um I used to hold some ethereum I
[16:05] sold it at a a profit I had some salana
[16:09] I sold it at a profit but I mean I feel
[16:10] like there was no real there was nothing
[16:12] there no real substance I mean people
[16:14] are using ethereum people say Okay smart
[16:16] contracts okay that's great but right
[16:19] now what are you using it for you using
[16:21] it for nfts right so I mean at at the
[16:23] point I didn't think of it that way I
[16:24] thought okay yeah this has a cult
[16:25] following I'm going to go for it I'm
[16:27] going to buy it sounds great but then I
[16:28] started learning more and more I think I
[16:30] started like you said I started with
[16:32] Bitcoin and then I saw I saw the
[16:35] altcoins and then I moved back to
[16:37] bitcoin so exactly like what you said
[16:39] the the best book that I read was the
[16:41] Bitcoin standard that one was great I
[16:44] feel like that one just it it showed you
[16:47] how money Works once once you see that
[16:50] you start under you start thinking why
[16:52] the why do most people why would anybody
[16:55] want to hold something that can be
[16:58] replaced with money when it can be
[17:01] replaced with uh
[17:03] Bitcoin right why would you want to hold
[17:05] real estate or why would you want to
[17:08] hold some random shitcoin when you can
[17:11] use Bitcoin and lightning or whatever
[17:12] layer twos are in the future I don't
[17:14] know how great they will be I've heard
[17:16] issues with lightning I have I've had no
[17:18] problems so far but why would you hold
[17:21] an altcoin if you have that capability
[17:23] with Bitcoin right the only layer that
[17:26] needs to be secure is the base layer
[17:28] everything else does not need to be
[17:30] secure right I mean of course you have
[17:32] your own levels there's custodians
[17:33] there's custody there's all that stuff
[17:35] involved but the base layer needs to be
[17:38] the most secure and it's intentionally
[17:40] slow right so once you get that it's
[17:42] hard to keep thinking about all the
[17:45] random coins that are out there was
[17:47] the use cases that what drove you from
[17:50] being Diversified in altcoins or
[17:53] shitcoins uh and then to bitcoin only
[17:56] like you saw the no long use cases of
[18:00] the AL coins or P gamble I'm going tell
[18:03] you straight up it was a pure gamble I
[18:05] didn't know anything about
[18:06] them okay okay okay I think most people
[18:09] are like that though right most people
[18:10] who are who are into alt coins they
[18:12] they're purely just gambling they're
[18:13] just seeing people buy it and they buy
[18:15] it themselves yeah and it's so sometimes
[18:17] so stupid uh to see um the people are
[18:20] like oh I I want to increase my Bitcoin
[18:23] stack so I am going to
[18:26] altcoins and I'm like this can be over
[18:29] tomorrow like you don't know what's
[18:31] going on with that random altcoin and of
[18:35] course maybe it can outperform Bitcoin
[18:36] but maybe it can also go to zero
[18:38] tomorrow you don't know it's like going
[18:40] to a casino and gambling 100 EUR on red
[18:45] of course you can make 500 EUR with it
[18:48] but you can also lose 100 with it like
[18:50] why are you doing that you're playing
[18:52] with your life's
[18:54] energy yeah I mean how I think of it is
[18:57] if I ever do need another coin in the
[18:59] future I'll buy it with my Bitcoin it'll
[19:01] likely be at a loss like the the the
[19:04] other coin will likely be trending
[19:05] towards zero in terms of Bitcoin so I'll
[19:08] be buying it at a discount most likely
[19:10] but I most likely I won't even need
[19:11] another coin right I mean if I do I buy
[19:13] it if I don't I didn't lose anything
[19:17] right when we're now going from that
[19:19] stage where like oh Bitcoin uh is now in
[19:24] before the Haring we are having now the
[19:26] Bitcoin ETF approv rooved uh um what do
[19:30] you see this year maybe the um effects
[19:35] of the Haring I think I also saw a
[19:37] highlight on your X posts or tweet posts
[19:42] uh where you said that um this Haring is
[19:46] not only about decreasing the new Supply
[19:50] um what do you think about the Haring
[19:52] and what impact it can have on bitcoin
[19:55] on the fundamentals and maybe also on
[19:57] the price so I think the in that thread
[20:00] I remember the thread that you're
[20:01] talking about I think the main thing
[20:02] that I was trying
[20:03] to point at is that this is more about
[20:07] trust the the having of course will have
[20:09] an impact but when people see that
[20:12] Bitcoin does exactly what it's supposed
[20:14] to do at block 840,000 the supply
[20:18] decreases from 6.25 Bitcoin to 3.125
[20:20] bitcoin with no regulation no regulating
[20:24] party no government nobody in the middle
[20:27] nobody nobody forcing it to happen when
[20:31] when people see that miners are are just
[20:34] doing it because they know how the
[20:36] system works they just want to play by
[20:37] the rules feel like that's going to
[20:39] change things because right now people
[20:41] think okay you can create as much
[20:43] Bitcoin as you want to who's going to
[20:45] stop the H who's going to who's going to
[20:47] force the having to happen miners can
[20:49] have actually received this question um
[20:51] somebody said what if a minor wants to
[20:53] create their own fork and keep getting
[20:55] 6.1 6.25 Bitcoin there's no value there
[20:59] right it's worthless so if a minor for
[21:03] example if they want to go ahead and put
[21:04] in uh a coinbase transaction for the
[21:07] 6.25 Bitcoin their block is going to be
[21:10] rejected right so there's it's all it's
[21:13] all
[21:14] already set up we already know where
[21:17] this is going it's just that people
[21:18] don't trust it right as the us as trust
[21:22] in the US dollar is dropping with the
[21:24] government printing more and more more
[21:25] and more more and more and more and more
[21:27] money
[21:29] trust in Bitcoin will increase right
[21:31] because people will see hey this thing
[21:34] is doing exactly what it's doing so as
[21:37] the US dollar inflates as more and more
[21:39] of it's printed over time all of that
[21:41] wealth will move to bitcoin I think more
[21:42] and more people will realize that more
[21:44] and more people will see that hey this
[21:48] thing is working exactly how people told
[21:51] us it will work so let's start figuring
[21:54] out what they're trying to say here
[21:56] it'll I think it'll what it'll do is it
[21:58] more than the impact of the actual
[22:00] Supply decreasing I think it'll have the
[22:02] impact of people realizing
[22:05] that these guys know what they're
[22:07] talking about they've done the research
[22:09] they know where this can potentially go
[22:12] so maybe we'll do the research too maybe
[22:13] we'll start learning I think the impact
[22:15] will be the usual impact is what six to
[22:19] nine months after the having something
[22:22] like that um I think that's the time
[22:24] when people learn right that's the time
[22:26] when people try to figure
[22:29] hey this thing is going to go crazy I
[22:32] I've seen people who have taken 15 hours
[22:35] to get to this point I've seen people
[22:36] who have taken it took me something like
[22:38] 3,000 hours right 3 to 5,000 hours
[22:41] because I was already buying Bitcoin but
[22:43] I wasn't all in until maybe six months
[22:45] ago right now I'm other than my primary
[22:47] residence I don't consider as it as an
[22:49] investment but now I'm all in right so
[22:52] the H what the Hing will do is it'll
[22:54] show people that this is doing exactly
[22:56] what it's meant to do and it'll prompt
[22:58] more people to put 1 to 5 to 10% of
[23:02] their portfolio into something they can
[23:04] they can trust right um instead of just
[23:07] blindly buying an index fund maybe
[23:10] they'll put $5 out of their $100 weekly
[23:13] into
[23:14] Bitcoin and that's going to accumulate
[23:16] very very
[23:18] quickly there are now two things coming
[23:21] up in my mind and there's like this
[23:23] Future Vision that we uh have and that
[23:26] uh sometimes differs between bitcoiners
[23:29] also this uh the one string is like the
[23:32] old old or traditional Financial system
[23:36] uh the Fiat world uh rent seeking caner
[23:39] effect and all this stuff that makes
[23:42] Fiat fat uh and it seems like there's
[23:45] this new system Bitcoin where we are
[23:48] building so many um great Technologies
[23:51] with lightning the fent with a lot of
[23:53] layers on top of it um and it seems like
[23:57] there's a leak from that system into the
[23:59] new system and like the first part of my
[24:02] question would be like um Can this
[24:05] system survive long term the old feeld
[24:08] system survive long term uh over maybe
[24:12] like the next F like let's take me as
[24:14] example I'm 25 um I if I live through
[24:19] 200 it will be like the next 75 uh uh
[24:23] years do you think I will see a day
[24:26] where there is no more fear um I mean if
[24:28] you if you really think about it it
[24:30] feels like governments are trying to
[24:32] make it more and more difficult for
[24:33] people to use Fiat because a lot of
[24:36] people use Fiat I mean they're they're
[24:38] just going to use a lot of older people
[24:40] use cash right they don't even use
[24:41] credit cards right so cash is
[24:44] disappearing why would a younger
[24:46] generation use something that they have
[24:48] to go to a bank to set up right why
[24:51] would they there was a talk by ant
[24:54] Andreas Antonopoulos about this he was
[24:57] talking about how
[24:58] how our kids like maybe his kids I don't
[25:01] know I don't know how old he is maybe in
[25:03] his for maybe in his late 30s early 40s
[25:06] um he was saying about how he was saying
[25:08] how our kids are probably never going to
[25:10] experience the banking system they're
[25:12] not going to why would they want to go
[25:13] into a bank right because what's going
[25:15] to happen is their children are going to
[25:17] have our children are are going to have
[25:20] little amounts of Bitcoin and maybe
[25:22] they'll start accumulating on their own
[25:24] maybe they'll start exchanging with
[25:26] their friends right maybe they'll um use
[25:28] Bitcoin to um maybe they'll start small
[25:32] smaller and smaller businesses as
[25:34] they're younger so why would they use
[25:35] something like a fiat currency where
[25:36] they have to go through a government
[25:38] right why would why would anybody choose
[25:40] to go through a currency that is
[25:44] controlled you can be censored you can
[25:46] you're you're going to be forced to be
[25:48] paying a tax right you're not going to
[25:49] have any choices right I think with
[25:52] Bitcoin it's just it's Freedom or one is
[25:55] freedom one is slavery right one is a
[25:58] way to increase your wealth over the
[26:00] long term the other one is to the other
[26:01] one is designed to decrease your wealth
[26:03] over the long term so why would people
[26:04] ever want to to go with Fiat so so back
[26:08] to your question you said um will we see
[26:10] this 15 20 years we might I mean there's
[26:13] probably still going to be people
[26:14] trusting it but over
[26:17] time with okay with the ETFs more and
[26:19] more people are able to save because
[26:21] they did they don't they don't want to
[26:22] put in the time to understand how
[26:23] Bitcoin Works they don't want to put in
[26:25] the time for Hardware wallets Buy it
[26:27] from an exchange they don't want to do
[26:28] all that but when they see the
[26:29] performance they might they may want to
[26:31] do more research right more and more of
[26:34] it is going to come off the exchanges
[26:35] people are going to be paying others for
[26:37] their goods and services in Bitcoin over
[26:39] the next 10 15 years I personally think
[26:43] Fiat currencies are set to die right one
[26:45] of the most I think one of the most
[26:48] difficult things about orange pilling
[26:50] someone is trying to convince them that
[26:52] something digital has value
[26:55] and with cbdcs Central Bank digital
[26:59] currencies governments are telling
[27:01] people hey something digital has value
[27:04] so it's fine if you use digital money
[27:06] they're they're basically just setting
[27:07] the Trap the Trap up for themselves
[27:10] right people only used Fiat currencies
[27:13] because of the cash they like the
[27:14] Privacy aspect of it but I mean over
[27:17] time there will be more and more reasons
[27:19] to go into Bitcoin right even right now
[27:22] people are figuring it out with cbdcs
[27:24] it'll be at a much faster Pace I'm
[27:26] superc decided to announce that this
[27:29] podcast got the first ever sponsor 21
[27:33] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[27:36] they teach and preach self- custody this
[27:39] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[27:43] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from this
[27:45] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[27:48] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[27:51] time support this podcast use code Robin
[27:54] and click the link in the description
[27:56] interesting I I see a lot of uh
[27:58] discussions in Bitcoin where they're
[28:00] like cbdcs are a threat to bitcoin and a
[28:03] threat to
[28:05] um the all lives in general and you see
[28:09] it more like a trojan horse uh of
[28:12] digital money like cbdcs are like this
[28:15] oh see everything digital has actually
[28:18] value and uh you can also have this
[28:22] Bitcoin because uh it also is digital
[28:24] and with cbdcs you have spending limits
[28:27] there's spending L on on bitcoin you
[28:29] have the cbc's total control uh you're
[28:32] going to get
[28:34] monitored with Bitcoin you have the
[28:36] control and you're not going to be
[28:38] monitored it's like cbdcs can be
[28:41] actually like a Dro I never thought
[28:42] about that it's really interesting
[28:43] thought the more I think about it the
[28:45] more true it is cbdcs as a droan horse
[28:49] for uh Bitcoin interesting yeah it's I
[28:53] feel like it's just going to it's going
[28:54] to take us deeper and deeper into
[28:56] digital currencies is as people I've
[28:59] seen I've heard the I've heard the
[29:01] phrase all roads lead to bitcoin CBDs
[29:04] are good for Bitcoin too very true um
[29:08] then when we have like now we have
[29:09] covered the cbdc or feat side of things
[29:13] when we now go to um the the Bitcoin
[29:16] side of things how we not how the old
[29:19] system crashes or crumbles down slowly
[29:22] um how are we going to build on bitcoin
[29:25] and I know there are a lot of uh
[29:27] thoughts around what layer two what
[29:29] layer three how many layers will be
[29:32] there on on bitcoin and this is like a
[29:33] topic where I'm actually undereducated I
[29:35] think uh and I just love the base layer
[29:39] and I think so many great things will
[29:42] happen on this layer on top of Bitcoin
[29:46] and with lightning as you said with uh I
[29:49] I heard two three guests about talking
[29:52] about fedy Min uh I think even Jeff bof
[29:55] mentions fedin sometimes
[29:58] um there are so many interesting
[30:00] projects on top of Bitcoin how do you
[30:02] see um Bitcoin evolving the development
[30:06] uh on like basically building Bitcoin
[30:09] for the next eight billion people to be
[30:12] on this whole base layer uh and single
[30:15] base layer on top of Bitcoin I me I
[30:17] think over time uh these layers are
[30:20] going to get better I don't I'm not
[30:22] going to say that I'm an expert on how
[30:23] they work or the mechanics or all that
[30:25] I'm not definitely not but I do
[30:28] understand how the financial system is
[30:29] built right even the current Financial
[30:31] system it's built with Swift at the
[30:35] bottom and then there's all these Banks
[30:39] uh and then there's Visa Mastercard
[30:41] about that right people try to compare
[30:45] the the base layer to Visa which makes
[30:49] no sense right if you so with with uh
[30:53] the base layer you can
[30:55] have they say one transaction or seven
[30:58] transactions per second Visa does 40
[31:01] thou 40,000 transaction per second but
[31:03] the thing is that there's there's a
[31:05] major there's a major difference here
[31:06] right Swift can't be reversed right
[31:09] Swift is the best comparison to the
[31:10] Bitcoin blockchain um you can't reverse
[31:13] transactions once your transaction is
[31:15] done it's done right the other side has
[31:17] to send back the money if you want it
[31:19] right if you want to get it back if you
[31:20] make a mistake they're probably not
[31:22] going to same thing with Bitcoin right
[31:24] Bitcoin gives you final settlement
[31:26] credit card don't give you final
[31:28] settlement credit cards um the balances
[31:30] I believe they settle up to 60 days out
[31:34] so if there's uh if somebody if you're a
[31:37] merchant and you want to be paid in Visa
[31:40] versus if you want to be paid in in
[31:43] Bitcoin your customer can cancel their
[31:45] transaction for 60 days with a Visa with
[31:48] a MasterCard nothing wrong with that I
[31:50] mean there's always going to be some
[31:51] kind of there can be fraud there can be
[31:53] certain issues that's just how the
[31:55] system works right we rely on a system
[31:57] built on trust right um with Bitcoin
[32:00] it's not built on trust you can't
[32:01] reverse a transaction if you pay
[32:03] somebody you're doing it out of your
[32:05] free will right you're not just you
[32:08] can't just tap a card unless you have it
[32:10] you probably won't store a large amount
[32:12] of your Bitcoin on your phone if
[32:13] somebody steals your phone and they
[32:15] start spending that's on you right you
[32:18] can't get it back but there are ways
[32:20] around this right there's Solutions you
[32:22] can put a lot of your Bitcoin offline
[32:24] you don't have to worry about that I
[32:26] think that was one of the main things
[32:27] that Satoshi wanted to achieve with this
[32:29] right he wanted to get rid of all these
[32:30] fees that um in the Fiat Financial
[32:33] system are charged just for either
[32:35] holding money um
[32:38] for uh we're charged an NSF fee for
[32:42] we're charged a fee for not having money
[32:44] in our account right you you go from
[32:48] negative to even more negative that's
[32:50] how the system works even if your
[32:52] paycheck is coming in in one or two days
[32:53] right the system
[32:55] is there's 's so many redundancies here
[32:58] there are so many issues that can be
[33:00] dealt with let's say we got paid every
[33:02] day instead of every two weeks right
[33:04] there would be no NSF fees with
[33:06] lightning employers can probably do that
[33:09] right they'll be able to do that I think
[33:11] um lightning or whatever whatever the
[33:13] other layers are I don't I don't know
[33:15] what the layers will be I don't know
[33:16] what will succeed all I know is that the
[33:18] base layer is is secure whatever
[33:22] Technologies you want to build on the
[33:23] base
[33:24] layer do it eventually will figure it
[33:28] out I think people will go to the one
[33:31] that has the best reputation I think
[33:34] maybe I think it's lightning or liquid
[33:36] one of those two I don't like I said I
[33:38] don't really know too much about them I
[33:40] don't act like I do I haven't done the
[33:42] research on them so I I think whichever
[33:45] one survives it survives I'm not in the
[33:46] spending my Bitcoin phase yet right so
[33:49] I'm not worried about what will be the
[33:52] future of the layer twos that may be 5
[33:54] 10 years from now right right now what
[33:56] I'm worried about is keeping my private
[33:58] Keys safe that's the most important
[34:01] thing to me yeah self custody keeping
[34:02] the private keys to yourself and uh
[34:05] don't mess it up that's a big big thing
[34:08] like don't build a maze around your
[34:11] Bitcoin so you cannot access them but
[34:13] also don't put them somewhere online so
[34:16] a hacker can easily have them that's
[34:19] like the the balance and the challenge
[34:22] that we have now as a Bitcoin we are now
[34:25] in the store value phase clearly as you
[34:27] said we're not in the phase where we are
[34:29] spending Bitcoin where we are doing all
[34:31] the stuff we are now in the store of
[34:33] value phase and even though we in that
[34:37] phase Bitcoin uh
[34:39] Bitcoins already started to spend
[34:42] Bitcoin there are Bitcoin meetups they
[34:44] they are paying with it there are shops
[34:46] that accept Bitcoin there are um I just
[34:49] saw a website before where you can uh
[34:52] buy Bitcoin out and you can only pay
[34:55] with Bitcoin it's not Bitcoin discount
[34:58] they don't accept anything else than
[35:00] Bitcoin and that's that's like oh
[35:03] interesting that's uh like if if more
[35:06] and more people do that and I mean that
[35:08] was with a Bitcoin art but if more and
[35:10] more bitcoiners do that maybe it's some
[35:12] point the store will also do that in
[35:14] like five 10 years and then this store
[35:17] does it and they're like oh Bitcoin is
[35:19] actually better for me and if I want
[35:21] feat I can convert some of my Bitcoin
[35:23] then to fat and use it if I really need
[35:25] it it's interesting how this um those
[35:28] phases will go in Bitcoin and I think a
[35:32] lot about uh a lot about how the how
[35:35] those phases will interact with each
[35:37] other like from collectible to store
[35:39] value to Medi of exchange to eventually
[35:43] as satoshis will be our unit of account
[35:47] yeah that's uh that's a that's a great
[35:49] thing you you also I had one post uh
[35:53] that stood out to me when I was
[35:55] scrolling through your Tweet tweets and
[35:58] I was like that's so true um you said
[36:02] you are not against capitalism you
[36:04] against feat and especially when I talk
[36:08] with um more uh left uh leaning um
[36:13] friends of mine they are like oh I'm
[36:16] against this and this and this and I'm
[36:17] like you are right this is all bad but
[36:20] this is not capitalism this is the the
[36:24] the system um and you also made a Fred
[36:27] with that maybe you can explain like
[36:29] what do you mean by not against
[36:32] capitalism but you're against fear so I
[36:35] think most people who think that they're
[36:38] against capitalism they
[36:40] don't
[36:42] understand that capitalism like the
[36:44] capitalism that we have today is built
[36:46] on a system that's meant to make your
[36:48] life more expensive so it doesn't matter
[36:51] how much technology improvements you
[36:53] have it doesn't matter um if you
[36:57] produce more products prices will get
[36:59] more expensive no matter what right and
[37:01] it's intentionally designed to do that
[37:04] how is that how how does that work it
[37:07] works because Fiat currencies the supply
[37:10] is there's no limit right there's no
[37:11] limit to the supply you can print as
[37:13] many dollars governments can just issue
[37:16] as many dollars as they want there's
[37:18] literally no physical substance behind
[37:21] it they can borrow as many dollars as
[37:23] they want all it does is dilutes
[37:25] everybody else's Holdings right so let's
[37:27] say you want to pay let's say you're
[37:29] getting paid $100,000 at your job your
[37:32] $100,000 10 years ago $100,000 would
[37:34] have paid rent it would have paid
[37:36] groceries it would have paid for
[37:37] entertainment it would have paid for
[37:38] some Investments it would have given you
[37:40] some savings on the side it would have
[37:42] paid for um your children it would have
[37:45] paid for extracurricular activities if
[37:46] you wanted to go let's say play a sport
[37:48] or if you want to go to the gym it'll
[37:49] pay for all of that today A lot of
[37:52] people are struggling with
[37:53] $100,000 right because right now rent
[37:57] the basic rent is in my area for example
[38:00] the basic rent for a one-bedroom uh
[38:03] condo is $2700 a
[38:06] month right so $2,700 a month works out
[38:08] to almost
[38:11] $35,000 a year right so 35% of your
[38:15] before tax income if you earn
[38:18] $100,000 35% of your before tax income
[38:21] is going towards rent right that means
[38:24] that after tax and on I where we're
[38:27] paying something like at that at that
[38:29] point you're paying something like 30 to
[38:31] 40% in taxes so 30 to 40% are going
[38:33] towards taxes 30 to 40% is going towards
[38:36] your income you have 20% left to to do
[38:39] whatever you want
[38:40] with right
[38:42] so I think a lot of people have the
[38:44] right idea in their mind where they
[38:46] think oh capitalism capitalism
[38:49] capitalism is designed
[38:51] to in increase prices because they need
[38:53] to make profits right the main reason
[38:56] why prices are going up is not because
[38:59] of capitalism it's going up because the
[39:01] value of the money that you're using to
[39:04] assign value to other things is going
[39:06] down right I think that's what people
[39:08] need to grasp once they understand that
[39:10] it's impossible
[39:13] to to reject Bitcoin right and most
[39:17] people don't understand that part they
[39:19] have the right idea in their minds but
[39:20] they don't they don't understand that so
[39:23] I think um with with capitalism
[39:26] capitalism prices are supposed to go
[39:27] down more and more production more
[39:29] competition it promotes competition with
[39:32] Fiat currencies only certain people
[39:34] certain companies there's too big to
[39:36] fail companies they get preference and
[39:39] their results compound over time so
[39:41] that's that's what people are are are
[39:43] pissed off with even let's say Apple for
[39:45] example Apple charges a 30% fee for
[39:48] people to sell their app on their app
[39:51] store right a 30% fee they wanted to
[39:54] they wanted to charge that fee to um
[39:57] Noster for every uh every I think it was
[39:59] something like that for every Satoshi
[40:01] that's moved 30% goes to Apple that's
[40:03] what want what they want it but it
[40:05] doesn't work that way I mean as more and
[40:07] more companies try to take on those
[40:09] kinds of roles as they try to do those
[40:11] things as they try to take their cut
[40:14] people are going to move away right I
[40:16] know a lot of people who moved away from
[40:17] iPhone to Android because they want to
[40:20] continue using Noster right and more
[40:22] people will do that over time do do we
[40:24] even live in a capitalism
[40:27] system if Capital itself the money is
[40:30] not free I don't think we do I think
[40:34] it's more it's more there have you heard
[40:36] of something called crony
[40:38] capitalism no it's basically where
[40:41] friends and family of governments get
[40:44] better treatment than everybody else and
[40:46] that's exactly what's happening right
[40:47] whoever gets paid under the table
[40:49] whoever pays you under the table gets
[40:50] the best that's what lobbying is right
[40:53] that's that's that's mostly what
[40:54] lobbying is meant to do that's basically
[40:56] Bally um I mean if you say it hard it's
[40:59] like a Ponzi scheme yeah that's exactly
[41:03] what it is right I mean they're they're
[41:04] taking they're taking money from they're
[41:07] promising money to Old investors at the
[41:10] expense of new investors pensions that's
[41:12] exactly what pensions are yeah it's it's
[41:14] it's for me so hard to see
[41:19] and that it's so interesting because a
[41:22] lot of people that are against Bitcoin
[41:24] and it gets those voices are getting uh
[41:29] um like they they they used to be really
[41:32] loud and not they now they're not as
[41:34] loud anymore but they they said a lot
[41:37] especially when I came into Bitcoin oh
[41:40] yeah but Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme it
[41:41] can only go up if people buying more of
[41:44] it I heard that so many times even from
[41:47] intelligent people and I was like what
[41:50] like not maybe not like people that did
[41:53] a lot of good stuff in their life I
[41:55] heard that from them and I was like this
[41:58] does not make sense at all but I could
[41:59] not put the finger on like why does it
[42:01] not make sense and this put me down the
[42:04] rabbit hole um of Ponzi schemes and I
[42:07] researched what is a Ponzi scheme and
[42:10] then I looked at the Fiat system then I
[42:11] looked at Bitcoin and I was like wait
[42:14] Fiat system is actually Ponzi scheme and
[42:17] I was already like one year into the
[42:19] Bitcoin education I was like what this
[42:22] was like this this glass breaking inside
[42:25] of your head and you and you you just
[42:27] like learned something completely new
[42:29] that actually changed uh your
[42:31] perspective a lot and this was like
[42:33] gradually but all of the sudden like
[42:36] what fear is a Ponzi scheme and it's
[42:38] that's interesting yeah how how uh I
[42:41] don't know if you mentioned it before
[42:42] maybe a little bit already but how did
[42:44] you actually go ahead and and learn
[42:46] about Bitcoin was it like books was it
[42:48] like podcasts how did you go ahead and
[42:50] and learn all this knowledge about
[42:53] Bitcoin and what you were talking about
[42:55] it's a complete parad shift once you see
[42:57] that Fiat is a Ponzi schem it completely
[42:59] changes your mind I age I agree I agree
[43:00] with you 100% so I I started learning um
[43:04] I don't remember what year it was it was
[43:05] either 2020 or 2021 I only started
[43:07] learning about this more recently but I
[43:09] put a lot of time into it right I left
[43:12] my job I was actually driving uh for
[43:15] Uber Eats for a while and I was just
[43:17] listening to podcasts while I was
[43:18] driving right I I would be doing like
[43:20] eight hour shifts I'd be learning for
[43:21] eight straight hours right um it it
[43:24] accumulated over time I was doing this
[43:26] while I was a realtor I was doing this
[43:28] while I was working at at my other job
[43:30] so it added up right all of that time
[43:33] added up uh the first uh before I was
[43:36] listening to Peter
[43:37] Schiff so I was just reading to his his
[43:40] I was listening to his information I was
[43:41] listening to his podcast during the
[43:42] pandemic I started learning more and
[43:44] more about just economics before that I
[43:46] was doing my CFA CFA was done after that
[43:49] I started learning more and more I
[43:50] started going deeper right I started
[43:52] listening to Peter shiff Peter shiff was
[43:54] saying how oh this Bitcoin thing is a
[43:55] scam it's going to zero and I was
[43:57] thinking why does this guy keep
[44:00] dedicating so much of his show to
[44:02] bitcoin why is he trying to convince us
[44:04] not to buy bit I don't even know about
[44:06] Bitcoin why is he talking to me about it
[44:08] right I would if without I mean I could
[44:10] actually thank him for talking about
[44:13] Bitcoin right because in his podcast it
[44:15] kind of sparked my it sparked it in my
[44:17] mind that okay this thing could be
[44:18] something and then actually before that
[44:21] my cooworker was telling me hey this
[44:23] learn about this thing this thing is
[44:24] crazy bitco is something that's probably
[44:26] going to change the rest of the world
[44:28] it's going to change a lot I started
[44:30] learning that it was basically just
[44:33] multiple things combined that got me to
[44:35] really start thinking in that way and
[44:37] then I started reading the Bitcoin
[44:38] standard from safe Adena moves that book
[44:40] was amazing I feel like that I actually
[44:44] have it right be I have it behind me you
[44:45] can see it there in the corner so that
[44:48] book changed my it changed my
[44:49] perspective on how Bitcoin Works how
[44:51] money Works before that just based on
[44:53] your based on what you were saying you
[44:54] were saying it's people think it's a
[44:55] Ponzi
[44:56] that's what I thought too right before
[44:58] 2020 I thought Bitcoin was a Ponzi
[45:00] because I hadn't done the research right
[45:02] I just assumed hey people think it's a
[45:04] Ponzi scheme so yeah maybe it is I don't
[45:07] need to do any more research on this and
[45:08] then I started digging deeper started
[45:11] digging deeper once you start okay so
[45:14] Michael sailor's voice sounds very
[45:16] annoying when you don't know what you're
[45:17] what he's talking about but then once
[45:19] you understand it it's like wow this guy
[45:23] really he almost sounds like a crazy
[45:25] person somebody who who doesn't know
[45:27] what he's talking about what who hasn't
[45:28] done the research but then once you've
[45:30] done the research there are so many
[45:32] breakthroughs that he's gotten me
[45:33] through right his content has gotten me
[45:36] to think about things so differently so
[45:40] um it changed my perspective right so I
[45:43] think the Bitcoin standard is one book
[45:45] that everybody needs to read regardless
[45:47] of where they are in their Bitcoin
[45:49] Journey it doesn't matter read that book
[45:52] I think it'll it'll give you some
[45:54] perspectives uh there's also the the
[45:55] Fiat standard from the same guy um but
[45:58] yeah those those changed my mind I like
[46:00] I said I thought Bitcoin was a Ponzi
[46:02] scheme until I started learning about it
[46:05] and I realized everything else is a
[46:07] Ponzi
[46:08] skin yeah the the free books from Cy mov
[46:12] are amazing the Bitcoin standard the
[46:14] Fiat standard and the principles of
[46:16] Austrian economics I think the third one
[46:18] is it's called this one is still on my
[46:20] read list uh but I still have like is
[46:24] one of the books I am like why did they
[46:26] not read it till now I think it will be
[46:28] great and also as you said pet Peter
[46:30] shiff is I think one of the greatest
[46:33] marketers for
[46:34] Bitcoin it's he's dedicating so much of
[46:38] his life to bitcoin and he was also one
[46:42] of the first uh people I heard in
[46:44] Bitcoin when I researched because
[46:46] there's a really popular debate uh with
[46:51] I don't know who was the Bitcoin guy
[46:53] Eric
[46:54] something
[46:56] it could be yes it's like a really
[46:59] popular debate on the Soho forum and and
[47:03] it was amazing to hear Peter Schiff
[47:07] versus him and I was like the more and
[47:09] more I get into this um debate first of
[47:12] all I understood what money is because
[47:14] both were like kind of against the fear
[47:16] system and they were teaching a little
[47:18] bit about what money actually is then I
[47:20] was like Peter shiff sounds really dumb
[47:23] and then I researched a lot about it
[47:26] so my my my my first uh things with him
[47:29] was like with the context of a bitcoiner
[47:32] and next to bitcoiner it's it it it
[47:35] almost feels like old man yelling at
[47:37] Bitcoin as as this m like that yeah
[47:42] accurate um it's it's it's actually so
[47:45] accurate yeah and you also have um uh
[47:49] one of one of your uh last things I I
[47:54] saw in your Twitter highlights was um
[47:57] money lessons for
[48:00] kids and I think it's so important to
[48:04] teach uh kids about Bitcoin and about
[48:06] money in general and there is like a lot
[48:09] of like even um cphon moose is I think
[48:13] working in the tutle twins cartoon if
[48:17] you saw the tutle twins cartoon already
[48:19] it's like a really cute cartoon for
[48:22] learning about uh Bitcoin and
[48:26] stuff like that is so valuable and maybe
[48:30] um the question to you is like what what
[48:33] money lessons or Bitcoin lessons uh
[48:36] because Bitcoin is money um can we teach
[48:40] uh our kids growing up like I am now 25
[48:43] I have no kids but let's assume I get
[48:45] kids in the next five years what what
[48:48] should we teach those kids uh what's
[48:51] like the most important stuff you think
[48:53] to know about money itself
[48:56] um I think something something important
[49:00] would be that money doesn't have to be
[49:01] produced by
[49:03] government right it doesn't have to be
[49:05] produced by a central party for it to be
[49:08] valuable right and I think they're going
[49:10] to get that themselves I don't even
[49:11] think that parents are going to teach
[49:13] their kids I think kids are going to
[49:15] teach their parents if anything right a
[49:17] lot of parents are right now a lot of
[49:18] parents a lot of grandparents have no
[49:20] idea what Bitcoin is I know I I actually
[49:23] spoke to my parents I spoke to my
[49:24] in-laws about how Bitcoin is the future
[49:28] it's where we're going kids are going to
[49:30] be teaching their parents right I don't
[49:31] think we need to teach our kids I think
[49:33] our kids are going to teach us right but
[49:35] while they're young of course maybe we
[49:36] can tell them how um your money is is
[49:40] your
[49:41] life right it's it's what you haven't
[49:45] spent it's what you've spent so much
[49:47] time earning right and if you if you're
[49:51] earning something that somebody else
[49:53] creates it's slav
[49:56] in the past in historical times when
[49:59] when there was when slavery was so
[50:00] obvious workers were getting what houses
[50:04] uh shelter food from their Master right
[50:09] today we're working for those and we're
[50:11] struggling to get the exact same things
[50:13] that we were getting for free right most
[50:16] people have to be working most more a
[50:18] lot of people are working more now than
[50:20] they were before right people are doing
[50:22] three jobs
[50:23] now right and they're getting
[50:26] less than they were getting as slaves so
[50:30] of course I mean I know a lot of people
[50:31] don't like that reference where oh you
[50:33] call fiat currency slaves but that
[50:35] that's slavery but that's exactly what
[50:37] it is right I mean you're you're working
[50:40] to earn something that somebody else can
[50:41] create for free just that I want that's
[50:44] what I want my kids to learn right you
[50:46] want your kids to know this is if you if
[50:49] you're working for something that
[50:50] somebody else can create for free you're
[50:51] going to you're not going to be able to
[50:52] build wealth right you're not going to
[50:53] be able to you're not going to save
[50:55] you're you're not going to have anything
[50:57] in the future you're going to be
[50:58] struggling financially because they're
[51:00] going to create more and and such an
[51:03] important lesson because when you when
[51:06] you think about that and uh really from
[51:09] first principles and you are like I work
[51:12] for something with my life's
[51:17] energy and all they're giving me is
[51:20] something they made up it's like yeah
[51:23] I'm going to to uh someone else like hey
[51:27] can you uh law my moan uh can you do can
[51:31] you bring me some food can you cook
[51:33] something for me and I'm like yes um
[51:35] wait I will take a piece of paper write
[51:37] something on this is
[51:40] your this is what I give you for it
[51:42] everybody would say like you're stupid
[51:44] like I don't take this piece of paper
[51:47] but you're taking the piece of paper of
[51:49] the government like what's what's
[51:51] different about it they made it up think
[51:54] about
[51:56] think about how many things are designed
[51:57] to get us to that point right where
[52:00] we're basically never told what money is
[52:03] most people just believe that money is
[52:05] pieces of paper if you try to convince
[52:07] them otherwise they're going to be like
[52:08] no it's so difficult to convince
[52:11] somebody that money is not paper it's
[52:14] not paper you need to get that out of
[52:17] your mind but people will work as hard
[52:19] as they can to not believe that because
[52:22] they've been taught that since the day
[52:24] where they were they were born
[52:26] right they were told their entire lives
[52:27] that oh you're going to save uh your
[52:29] coins and bills in this little piggy
[52:31] bank and this is your money
[52:34] but it's not money you believe it but
[52:38] it's not it's not actual money it's just
[52:40] a currency it's something that's
[52:41] designed to lose value it's not at all
[52:43] money yeah it's very very true um we are
[52:47] having
[52:48] an end routine in the podcast where the
[52:51] previous guest asks a question for the
[52:53] next guest and it's it's an interesting
[52:57] question because you also have like the
[53:00] um yeah the the financial background to
[53:03] it um if you would live in a world
[53:07] completely on a Bitcoin standard uh what
[53:10] terms would it take for you uh to borrow
[53:14] out your Bitcoin to someone else like
[53:17] what would it take for you to uh lend
[53:20] someone your Bitcoin to do something or
[53:24] would you take do this at all wow that's
[53:27] a that's a really good question so right
[53:28] now the risk-free
[53:31] rate for US bonds is something like what
[53:35] is it like four
[53:37] five% I don't know what it is I think
[53:39] that's around what it is for long-term
[53:41] bonds um I mean you can get gic's in
[53:45] Canada for six with 6% interest you're
[53:48] getting savings account with 6% but
[53:50] there's so much risk involved right but
[53:53] in that case the thing is that you can
[53:54] print your money
[53:55] for free you can just create more of it
[53:57] if somebody walks away with it you can
[53:59] PR you can print more and make the
[54:00] person happy right if the bank walks
[54:02] away with your money you can print more
[54:03] and give it to customers and they'll
[54:04] continue to trust the system I would put
[54:08] the rate higher than
[54:11] 6% I would probably make it something
[54:15] like 10 to 12 10 to 15 maybe even higher
[54:19] right because it doesn't make any sense
[54:21] to me to give away something that's
[54:24] finite something that I may never ever
[54:27] get back again at a low rate like 3% I
[54:32] know there's people who get loans
[54:34] for um much higher I know sorry much
[54:38] lower they get loans for like 8% 7% to
[54:41] me that doesn't make sense unless it's
[54:43] unless you have um unless you have a
[54:45] pool of funds that are being lend lent
[54:48] out it makes sense in that case cuz then
[54:50] the chance of somebody losing money is
[54:51] lower but if it was me peer-to-peer
[54:53] lending to someone I wouldn't do it for
[54:54] Less than 12% maybe 15% so I mean to me
[54:59] it's it's not worth it to lend for
[55:01] anything less than that I personally
[55:03] think that that's one of the reasons why
[55:04] house prices will also come
[55:06] down it won't be worth it for lenders to
[55:09] lend Bitcoin for somebody to buy a house
[55:11] I mean the the whole uh credit system
[55:14] everything that's built on top and all
[55:16] the prices actually will come down on a
[55:18] Bitcoin center right it's like even your
[55:21] banana in the supermarket will come down
[55:22] in prices your your your will come down
[55:25] in prices your microphone will come down
[55:27] in prices everything you see around you
[55:30] because we getting more productive
[55:31] you're getting more clever in con
[55:34] producing uh a thing whatever the thing
[55:37] is uh the prices has to come down and we
[55:41] are actually from a natural standpoint
[55:43] of view as with capitalism and we are in
[55:46] a deflationary system and we are only
[55:48] experienced that
[55:50] inflationary uh uh system because we
[55:53] have the Fiat system so I think there a
[55:55] lot of work that I think also Jeff Bo
[55:58] did with his work the priz of tomorrow
[56:01] and it's like yeah it's it's it's a mind
[56:03] shift we have we have to to make and
[56:06] more and more people coming into the
[56:07] space more and more Educators as
[56:10] yourself it's so important that we we
[56:12] speak up about exactly that topic and
[56:15] this was like also kind of the um thing
[56:18] why I make this podcast because I want
[56:20] to show to everybody all those great
[56:23] minds in Bitcoin and I think you are an
[56:26] an amazing speaker and extremely
[56:28] articulated when it comes to like what
[56:31] Bitcoin is and what it can do so uh
[56:33] thank you for being on the show and
[56:35] thank you for being uh part of our our
[56:37] small Bitcoin movement to make uh the
[56:40] the world a little bit better I
[56:42] appreciate that thank you I it's I feel
[56:45] like uh the education part is there
[56:48] because I've been teaching about
[56:49] personal finance for so long it's been
[56:51] about two and a half years um yeah I
[56:53] think more people are going to more
[56:55] people are going to get better more
[56:56] people are going to be better getting
[56:57] better at teaching this more it it'll
[56:59] become more and more widely available I
[57:01] think podcasts like yours podcast like
[57:03] any others platforms like mine we're all
[57:06] going to be helping a lot of people get
[57:10] off the
[57:11] sinking ship that Fiat currencies are
[57:15] stuff all that stuff is going to Trend
