[00:00] Bitcoin mining can reduce the
[00:01] electricity cost for everybody I was not
[00:04] only saving €3,000 for the heating oil
[00:06] but I gained another ,000 in Surplus so
[00:10] in total I was €4,000 cheaper to heat
[00:13] with Bitcoin mining instead of heating
[00:15] oil it's cheaper it's better for the
[00:17] environment it's really hard to argue
[00:19] that Bitcoin mining is bad so you got
[00:22] paid for heating your house you used the
[00:24] heat as a main product and through that
[00:27] Bitcoin mining becomes profitable in
[00:29] many plac places here in Europe as well
[00:31] you produce your Bitcoin yourself for
[00:34] mining kyc free Bitcoin
[00:37] 170,000 tatt hours of primary energy we
[00:40] use every single year 50% of that energy
[00:43] we use to
[00:44] [Music]
[00:48] heat what what chance is Bitcoin mining
[00:53] giving us for the environment what what
[00:55] what kind of positive impact will
[00:56] Bitcoin mining has for for our planet I
[00:59] think the perfect example is maybe my
[01:01] personal story how I got to Bitcoin
[01:03] mining um I was living in
[01:07] 20020 in a single family home here in
[01:10] Tyrell in Austria and I was heating with
[01:13] heating oil a pretty old heating
[01:15] standard and then I started Bitcoin
[01:18] mining and these Bitcoin miners got
[01:19] really really hot and I figured maybe I
[01:22] can heat my home with that so I built a
[01:25] prototype to bring down the noise level
[01:28] and after the first heating season I was
[01:31] pretty stunned because I was not only
[01:33] saving €3,000 for the heating oil but on
[01:37] top onto the higher electricity bill I
[01:40] gained another th000 in Surplus so in
[01:43] total I was €4,000 cheaper to heat with
[01:47] Bitcoin mining instead of heating oil
[01:50] and a very positive side effect is
[01:52] because I used 100% Hydro power here in
[01:55] Tyrell um I had zero CO2 emissions
[01:58] compared to the heating oil so for me it
[02:01] was an absolute no-brainer it's cheaper
[02:04] it's better for the environment so um if
[02:07] you if you experience that once um it's
[02:10] really hard to argue that Bitcoin mining
[02:13] is bad and yeah after the second
[02:16] successful heating season it was for me
[02:18] really a no-brainer and I thought why is
[02:21] not everybody heating like that or more
[02:23] people heating like that and I started
[02:26] to build prototypes and started 21 energ
[02:30] to build plug andplay Bitcoin heaters
[02:33] for the broader Market because there was
[02:35] nothing on the market which was
[02:39] usable wait so you you usually have a
[02:43] $33,000 bill in paying for the heating
[02:46] system but you installed the Bitcoin
[02:48] Miners and then you gained so you got
[02:52] paid for heating your house did I get
[02:54] that correct so I paid usually per
[02:57] winter €3,000 or dollars for heating oil
[03:01] and I just burned the heating oil so it
[03:04] is the central heating system keeps the
[03:06] house warm and then I completely shut
[03:10] down um the oil heating system that's
[03:13] not 100% true I still had 5% for warm
[03:16] water for showering and stuff like that
[03:19] but uh I did zero Heating and did 100%
[03:22] heating with um Bitcoin mining so I
[03:26] adapted some Bitcoin miners that they
[03:28] are not uh loud as a motorcycle so I
[03:31] also can run them directly in my living
[03:33] room and I got down to for 40 50 dbel
[03:37] now we are at 35 DB it's like uh even
[03:41] quieter than a bridge and I was running
[03:44] the Bitcoin miners directly in the
[03:46] living room and of course I had a
[03:49] drastic increase in the electricity bill
[03:51] because I was using 16,000 kilowatt
[03:55] hours of electricity to heat my home but
[03:58] um back then I earned more with Bitcoin
[04:01] mining than the electricity costs me
[04:05] like €1,000 more than the electricity
[04:07] cost was and I needed zero heating oil
[04:12] to heat only for the warm water and so
[04:14] in total I saved €4,000 compared to my
[04:18] previous heating system and that's
[04:21] that's how it started that's super
[04:24] interesting uh I mean it's also
[04:26] interesting to to see when for like for
[04:28] example I live in apartment in Vienna
[04:31] would it be very uh good for me to turn
[04:36] off the heaters completely and just like
[04:38] plug in the the heating systems is that
[04:42] is that something that's more efficient
[04:44] uh if you're just like living in an
[04:46] apartment in let's say Vienna or
[04:47] something like that or is it better if
[04:49] you have a house and you can control
[04:51] more of the aspect of it it doesn't
[04:53] matter that much if you're living in an
[04:55] apartment or in um single family home um
[04:59] of course course if you are in a in in a
[05:02] space where where are many flats and you
[05:06] pay a fixed amount for your example you
[05:09] don't pay for the amount of heat you
[05:11] take but for the square meters you live
[05:13] in then of course it doesn't you don't
[05:15] have an incentive to save um energy but
[05:19] if you pay for your uh energy yourself
[05:21] it definitely can make sense it always
[05:24] depends of course on the Bitcoin mining
[05:26] profitability on and on your electricity
[05:28] bill costs and of course on the heating
[05:31] opportunity costs um if you're currently
[05:35] heating uh your home with heating oil
[05:37] here in Austria pretty much for
[05:40] everybody which is who is using heating
[05:42] oil it would make sense to change to
[05:44] bitcoin heaters it would be uh cheaper
[05:47] and um more sustainable um but of course
[05:51] you have to do the calculations yourself
[05:54] does it make sense for yourself um for
[05:57] example if you are living in Germany or
[06:00] with the highest electricity costs it
[06:03] can make sense but some cases of course
[06:06] it doesn't make any sense but um there
[06:10] are no Bitcoin mining farms in Austria
[06:12] or Germany because of the high
[06:14] electricity cost but we Bitcoin Heats
[06:16] are much more efficient than a Bitcoin
[06:19] mining Farm because you're using the um
[06:22] heat as well um it's not you don't have
[06:25] waste heat you use the heat as a main
[06:28] product
[06:29] and through that it Bitcoin mining um
[06:33] becomes profitable in many places here
[06:35] in Europe as well it's also a question
[06:39] that that I had like why don't we have
[06:41] like we have hydrop power why don't we
[06:43] use that for for Bitcoin mining in
[06:45] Austria and maybe Germany there were a
[06:47] few um Bitcoin uh mining farms in small
[06:52] uh Hydro power plants but um Global
[06:56] mining just got so competitive that it's
[06:59] not to only run a Bitcoin mining Farm
[07:01] without any waste heat utilization you
[07:04] have to have electricity prices in the
[07:07] range of 4 cents if you're doing only
[07:09] Bitcoin mining but it's a completely
[07:11] different model if you're needing
[07:13] needing the heat anyway it's a
[07:16] completely different calculation because
[07:18] if you already pay let's say 14 cents or
[07:21] something like that for gas or for oil
[07:24] per kilowatt hour of heat um it's a
[07:27] completely different model and if you
[07:28] can get here in Austria at the moment
[07:30] the electricity approximately for 18 to
[07:33] 20 cents so um that's only 4 cents more
[07:38] than the gas or oil and you only have to
[07:41] earn debt for example to break even with
[07:45] gas or oil that you would have the same
[07:47] electricity costs but um so in over the
[07:50] last last 12 months for example uh
[07:53] Bitcoin heer with an an minor s9k Pro
[07:57] inside earned approximately 14 cents per
[08:00] kilowatt hour cash back so if you pay in
[08:03] Austria 20 cents per kilowatt hour for
[08:06] example and you get 14 cents back you
[08:10] have still a loss of 6 cents per
[08:12] kilowatt hour but it's way cheaper than
[08:14] 14 cents for gas or oil so in total you
[08:17] save 8 cents per kilowatt hour compared
[08:19] to oil or gas and but you could also use
[08:23] a variable electric tariff where you
[08:26] have a different electricity price every
[08:28] single hour for for example I have
[08:30] something like that myself and I'm
[08:33] heating for example especially then when
[08:36] the electricity is cheap and when the
[08:38] electricity is expensive I shut down the
[08:41] the Bitcoin heater for example and uh we
[08:44] have um in our Bitcoin heater for our
[08:47] own microcontroller where you can
[08:49] connect with your smart home or for
[08:52] example also variable electric tariffs
[08:54] that feature is not live yet but will
[08:56] come online in the next two to three
[08:58] months
[09:00] where you can connect your variable
[09:01] electric tariff um to the Bitcoin heater
[09:05] and then you're only running it it for
[09:07] example when the electricity is below a
[09:10] certain threshold so you are sure that
[09:13] you're always um cheaper or more
[09:16] profitable than your current heating
[09:19] system are those uh Bitcoin that you
[09:22] mind there kc3 how does how does the
[09:24] regulatory body look look at that
[09:28] part um
[09:30] yeah you produce your Bitcoin yourself
[09:32] um like you you're are mining kyc free
[09:35] Bitcoin you can choose any pool you like
[09:38] with the Bitcoin heater and um it's your
[09:42] part to declare that to the like you you
[09:47] can make different for example here in
[09:49] Austria you can say okay I paid 20 cents
[09:52] per kilowatt hour for electricity and I
[09:55] got back in with Bitcoin Min mining 14
[09:58] cents but you still in profit but
[10:00] because you are still cheaper than oil
[10:02] or gas but if you now make um uh income
[10:06] report from your mining um you say okay
[10:09] I paid 20 cents and I only got 14 cents
[10:12] back I don't have to pay taxes on that
[10:15] because I didn't make any uh rep like
[10:18] Surplus um or you could also in Austria
[10:21] you have the option to do that or the
[10:23] other you pay
[10:26] 27.5 um flat
[10:30] tax and you don't have to make a small
[10:33] calculation with what did you pay for
[10:35] the electricity and what was your income
[10:37] the regulatory body is not like there
[10:41] are not there is not a Bitcoin heating
[10:45] uh tax law yet and probably will take a
[10:48] lot more years to come um yeah uh the
[10:52] tax authorities I don't think they have
[10:55] Bitcoin heating on their on their f at
[10:59] the moment this is super interesting so
[11:02] like a a company could if if a company
[11:05] has a big space and demand a lot they
[11:08] could actually deduct that from their
[11:10] income and save taxes potentially with
[11:12] with that method and and accumulate
[11:14] Bitcoin with that uh if if if the income
[11:17] is not positive but you actually can
[11:19] report a loss with with that mining
[11:22] business know like if you're a business
[11:24] it's a little bit different because you
[11:27] would before you had to pay for example
[11:30] €100,000 for oil and then you're paying
[11:34] €150,000 for electricity but you get for
[11:38] example
[11:39] 80,000 um back in Bitcoin mining reports
[11:42] or something like that or probably more
[11:45] um then of course uh you will pay P
[11:49] taxes because you have higher Surplus
[11:51] than before uh and so of course you will
[11:55] pay taxes on your higher Revenue um but
[11:59] you also have um maybe you have a lot of
[12:02] tax advantages because um you are now
[12:05] not
[12:06] emitting less CO2 emissions because that
[12:09] gets taxed for large companies as well
[12:12] so you can save potentially taxes by
[12:16] heating with Bitcoin because you have
[12:18] less CO2 emissions with Bitcoin heating
[12:20] instead of the uh traditional oil or gas
[12:24] heating systems absolutely I did not F
[12:27] about that aspect yeah it's really it's
[12:29] like the whenever I talk about Bitcoin
[12:31] mining uh especially on Twitter the the
[12:34] thing that always comes back to me is
[12:36] like oh yeah we want KC Free Bitcoin
[12:38] with Bitcoin mining I don't care if I
[12:39] pay a little bit extra if it's
[12:41] inefficient a lot of people go go that
[12:44] route for for Bitcoin mining it's an
[12:46] incentive that Bitcoin mining gives you
[12:48] exactly and Bitcoin heating is also
[12:50] perfect for that of course you have a
[12:52] superent Bitcoin minor but it's nothing
[12:54] different than that yes absolutely yeah
[12:57] really cool um let's dive into
[12:59] uh some other reasons why Bitcoin mining
[13:02] might be really good for for for for the
[13:04] planet and for the crit also um you
[13:06] mentioned it a little bit and I think we
[13:08] have in Texas probably the most popular
[13:11] example where they work really closely
[13:13] together with the git the miners and how
[13:16] the the miners are really um they can
[13:18] shut down and ramp up really quickly
[13:21] against like some other industry they
[13:23] cannot do um how do you look at that
[13:26] what other aspects grid balancing or
[13:28] maybe is there something else also that
[13:29] do you look at when it comes to positive
[13:31] aspects of of Bitcoin mining Bitcoin
[13:34] mining you mine Bitcoin with an Asic
[13:37] Miner that's an application specific
[13:38] integrated circuit and that's nothing
[13:40] else than a superc computer which is
[13:42] dedicated to one task and that's
[13:44] producing as much hashes as possible
[13:47] with the lowest amount of energy and at
[13:49] the same time you have a 100% efficiency
[13:53] converting the electricity into heat so
[13:55] that's one very cool aspect of Bitcoin
[13:58] mining uh that you have you don't have
[14:00] any losses by producing the heat through
[14:02] the mining aspect so you have like 200%
[14:06] efficiency of course that's not possible
[14:08] but you're doing the calculations and
[14:10] still have 100% um of
[14:13] the of the Heat and at the same time um
[14:16] you get paid depending on which um
[14:21] mining pool you are using but there are
[14:23] mining pools where you get paid exactly
[14:26] um for every single calculation so it
[14:28] doesn't matter if you run the Bitcoin
[14:30] minor 10 seconds 10 hours or um 10 days
[14:35] you get exactly it's a linear function
[14:38] you get exactly paid for the amount of
[14:41] calculations you did so you could um for
[14:44] example if you have uh solar on the roof
[14:46] you can also monetize your Surplus um
[14:49] electricity yourself and have maybe a
[14:52] shter amotization period by mining uh
[14:55] your Surplus electricity instead of um
[14:58] putting it into the grid and now to the
[15:02] to the Texas um there are large mining
[15:06] facilities they are running very new
[15:08] Bitcoin Miners and they try to have a
[15:11] high up time um but when the electricity
[15:14] is really expensive they shut down and
[15:16] that's how they stabilize the
[15:18] electricity grid um we are just starting
[15:21] at the moment it also a grid balancing
[15:24] project but a little bit different than
[15:25] they do it in Texas um here it's called
[15:30] negative grid balancing and it works
[15:34] like that um we have a large Bitcoin
[15:36] mining container with a lot of ant Miner
[15:38] S9 that's the Bitcoin mining Hardware
[15:41] from the year
[15:43] 2017 which is approximately three to
[15:45] four times less efficient than the
[15:49] newest mining Hardware they use in the
[15:51] Texas for example for grid balancing but
[15:54] um we only uh run the Bitcoin mining
[15:57] container when there is too much
[15:59] electricity in the grid and that happens
[16:02] quite often it happens actually every
[16:04] single day at the moment um always when
[16:07] the frequency in the grid is over 50
[16:10] Heartz it always must stay at 50 Heartz
[16:13] um because we have to consume all the
[16:15] electricity produce exactly at the same
[16:18] moment and because we are pushing
[16:21] forward the energy transition so fast
[16:23] and we are building so much solar and so
[16:25] much wind energy we often have too much
[16:28] electricity in the grids and that's also
[16:31] a problem and we have to get rid of the
[16:33] electricity and you get paid to do that
[16:36] so at the moment there are for example
[16:39] Hydro power pumps power plants where
[16:43] they put up the water they pump it back
[16:45] into the mountains again and if the
[16:48] electricity price is high they let it
[16:50] down again in the power plant and create
[16:53] electricity so it's like a very large
[16:55] natural
[16:57] battery but that's that's still too less
[17:01] because they build out uh renewable
[17:05] energies that fast we need way more
[17:08] capacity to put load onto the grid so if
[17:12] there is too much electricity we can get
[17:14] rid of it and that's how we do the grid
[17:17] balancing we build Bitcoin mining
[17:19] containers with old mining Hardware
[17:22] which only has an up time of in average
[17:24] over the last years of 30 minutes a day
[17:26] so our Bitcoin ant minus S9 running 30
[17:29] minutes a day but we get paid by the
[17:32] Austrian power grid um to be ready 24/7
[17:37] you get also paid for that and then you
[17:39] get paid negative electricity prices so
[17:42] we get paid to take the electricity
[17:44] because at the moment it's a problem
[17:46] because we have more than 50 hearts in
[17:48] the
[17:49] grid and that's how we do it like we
[17:52] have a mining container ready 24/7 and
[17:54] if there is too much electricity we
[17:56] power on our Bitcoin mining container
[17:59] and get paid to be available and we get
[18:02] paid to take for the amount of
[18:05] electricity we took um for example uh 50
[18:09] to 100 EUR per megawatt hour and that's
[18:12] how we stabilize the grid and that which
[18:17] is also really cool because we have an
[18:19] additional Revenue stream through the
[18:20] Bitcoin mining we can often do it much
[18:23] cheaper than competitors and so from
[18:27] that logic we reduce the electricity
[18:30] costs for everybody in Austria because
[18:32] we can do the grid
[18:33] stabilization uh much cheaper than
[18:35] others so Bitcoin mining can reduce the
[18:39] electricity cost for everybody and I
[18:41] think that's a really cool example uh to
[18:44] show um Bitcoin mining is the perfect
[18:47] fit for the energy transition we can we
[18:50] can move forward much faster with the
[18:52] energy transition and we can do it also
[18:55] much more cheaply than with uh without
[18:58] Bitcoin money that's an amazing examp I
[19:01] didn't knew that that was happening in
[19:03] Austria like that that's really cool
[19:05] we're just getting started so it's still
[19:07] it's at the moment we are doing the test
[19:09] runs and uh it's not in a large in a
[19:13] large volume at the moment but we have
[19:16] uh 17,000 S9 already in our warehouse so
[19:19] we can build approximately 22 mining
[19:22] containers with a megawatt of
[19:25] consumption and we will build out
[19:28] hopefully next year a lot of
[19:30] that sorry I'm still here my camera just
[19:34] died because I'm hours and hours of uh
[19:38] podcasting my my camera probably
[19:43] overheated but let let's see how long it
[19:45] runs so don't don't be confused if my
[19:47] camera is just turning black uh I'm I'm
[19:50] still here it's it's not it's not a big
[19:52] problem uh then now people can also see
[19:55] there's my bad going on and there's my
[19:58] my my thing going on uh I think that's
[20:01] the first time ever it was shown in the
[20:02] podcast but yeah it's it's it's all
[20:06] right yeah it's it's a really
[20:08] interesting uh example
[20:11] um I'm kind of amazed that this is not a
[20:14] bigger story I'm kind of amazed that not
[20:16] more people are talking about that even
[20:19] in Bitcoin uh we talk a lot about the
[20:21] monetary aspect we talk a lot about uh
[20:24] the Bitcoin edfs we talk a lot about the
[20:26] presidential election but
[20:29] how amazing is that you can just balance
[20:31] the G like it's it's a utility value of
[20:33] Bitcoin mining uh that is just you
[20:36] cannot uh say anything against that like
[20:39] it's just like hard facts that it's good
[20:40] for the Grid it's it's really good for
[20:43] for the electricity cost and it it
[20:46] should be just talked about everywhere
[20:49] uh it's it's interesting that it's not
[20:50] talked about more uh how do you see you
[20:53] probably also are in contact maybe a
[20:54] little bit with the regulator in in in
[20:56] Austria how do you look at that
[20:59] is that a big story maybe in the coming
[21:02] years or is that always like under the
[21:04] under the radar at some
[21:05] point I think at the moment it's still
[21:08] very much under the radar um but you
[21:13] only come to bitcoin if you have a
[21:15] problem if you don't have a problem you
[21:17] and you don't see the solution in
[21:18] Bitcoin it's very hard to get Bitcoin
[21:21] and that's like we have at 21 energy we
[21:24] have for our bitcoiners we have two
[21:26] large customer segments the first large
[21:29] customer segments are bitcoiners of
[21:31] course they get it why Bitcoin mining is
[21:33] cool and why and why decentralized
[21:36] Bitcoin mining not in large mining Farms
[21:38] is cool and the second large customer
[21:42] segment are people with a solar uh panel
[21:45] on the roof and they maybe did we get a
[21:49] lot of emails from our customers they
[21:51] didn't get they didn't get Bitcoin at
[21:55] all but they had a problem they didn't
[21:57] get a contract so can put in the
[21:59] electricity the Surplus electricity into
[22:01] the grid so they had to have find a way
[22:04] to monetize the Surplus energy for
[22:07] themselves so and
[22:10] then they buy a Bitcoin heater they mine
[22:14] Bitcoin with 100% uh green energy they
[22:17] get heat and Heat their home for example
[22:20] use of course in Winter you don't
[22:22] produce that much Surplus electricity
[22:24] but still 30% of the uh solar you
[22:28] produce use is in the heating months and
[22:31] 70% is in in the summer when you don't
[22:33] need any more heat and that's a really
[22:36] cool perspective and we get a lot of
[22:37] mails from customers they said they
[22:40] didn't think anything about Bitcoin
[22:42] nothing good um but if they feel um if
[22:46] they come through the energy perspective
[22:47] to bitcoin and see okay I can monetize
[22:51] my green Surplus energy myself and I
[22:53] have heat uh on top of that what can be
[22:57] so bad about Bitcoin
[22:58] and often people fall really fast and
[23:03] really deep into the Bitcoin rabbit hole
[23:04] if they come through the energy
[23:06] perspective I think at the moment still
[23:08] the most come through the uh money or
[23:11] number go up technology aspect but we
[23:15] got a few cool stories of customers who
[23:18] came through the um energy perspective
[23:21] and I love that um but in to in in in
[23:25] general I think it's still in in Europe
[23:29] completely under the radar and but we
[23:32] get more more problems with the energy
[23:35] transition and we have high interest um
[23:38] for the Bitcoin mining containers we're
[23:39] just getting started with the um
[23:42] negative grid balancing and we have
[23:44] already a few um people from large um
[23:50] energy companies which want to to take a
[23:53] look at the Bitcoin mining container as
[23:55] soon as it is running so I think there
[23:58] will be some breast coverage and things
[24:02] changing when we when it gets gets to
[24:06] the right people because they have a lot
[24:08] if they have energy problem and Bitcoin
[24:10] money can um solve that they will get it
[24:14] I partnered up with coin vigilante this
[24:17] is the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[24:20] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[24:23] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[24:26] vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin watch
[24:29] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[24:32] go out there and show that you are a
[24:34] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[24:37] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[24:40] dropped a completely new and amazing
[24:43] Genesis edition of their watch
[24:46] collections you have the date of the
[24:48] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[24:51] and of course also the block height and
[24:54] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[24:57] level of of detail they put in in this
[25:00] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[25:02] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[25:06] down in the descriptions I love those
[25:08] watches so so much if you watch or
[25:11] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[25:14] I'll guess you already bought some
[25:16] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[25:18] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[25:22] in a hardware wallet my personal
[25:24] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[25:26] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[25:28] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[25:30] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[25:33] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[25:37] with the code Robin at the checkout
[25:39] visit bitbox dos Swiss robobin to get
[25:43] your bitbox and the next step is to
[25:46] really level up your sovereignty as an
[25:48] individual you have to have the most
[25:50] secure self custody setup you have to
[25:53] secure your own devices you have to
[25:56] protect your privacy you have to set up
[25:59] an inheritance plan and depending on
[26:01] where you live you even want to have a
[26:03] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[26:06] in case something goes really really
[26:08] wrong and through all those steps the
[26:10] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[26:13] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[26:16] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[26:19] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[26:22] how you can level up your sovereignty
[26:25] absolutely um when you look at all the
[26:27] develop ments that's going on right now
[26:29] with Bitcoin mining and uh with with
[26:32] everything do you think at some point
[26:34] Bitcoin mining will just be a part of
[26:37] everything like the the fridge maybe
[26:41] fridge is maybe an interesting examp
[26:42] like but like small house uh gadgets
[26:45] just have like small Bitcoin mining in
[26:47] them or like every house has uh a
[26:50] Bitcoin mining unit in there because
[26:53] it's just like way more efficient to do
[26:54] it uh apartment complexes have always
[26:57] like Bitcoin mining do you think that
[27:00] Bitcoin miny is actually so
[27:01] decentralized in the future and so far
[27:03] implemented in in so many different ways
[27:06] in in houses and stuff like that maybe
[27:07] even in electric cars I don't know uh
[27:10] that that it's it's like that we as a
[27:12] humankind I think it was
[27:15] 170,000 terawatt hours of primary energy
[27:19] we use every single year um that's oil
[27:23] gas electricity everything combined and
[27:27] 50% of that energy we use to heat like
[27:31] we produce heat it's not 100% for
[27:34] heating but producing stuff plastic
[27:37] asphalt you need so much uh heat to
[27:41] produce things and in total 50% of the
[27:44] energy we consume as a species is heat
[27:48] so you can think how large the potential
[27:53] is at the moment I think um 86,000
[27:58] terawatt hours um a year the human
[28:02] mankind needs to produce heat and
[28:04] Bitcoin mining is I
[28:06] think1 terawatt hours a year so if we
[28:09] would only Bitcoin mine where we need
[28:11] the heat uh anyway we could grow
[28:14] something like 800x and still does don't
[28:18] have an own energy footprint because we
[28:20] need the heat anyway Bitcoin mining can
[28:23] do that with 100% efficiency you don't
[28:25] have any losses by Bitcoin mining so if
[28:27] we would mine 100% where we need the
[28:31] heat anyway we can grow 800x so I think
[28:34] Bitcoin mining at the moment is a a race
[28:37] to the efficiency and uh I think Bitcoin
[28:42] mining at the moment like I probably
[28:46] 89 uh 98% or something like that or
[28:49] nearly 100% is done in large mining
[28:52] Farms um but I think Bitcoin heating or
[28:57] Bitcoin mining where you need the heat
[28:59] in the long run has much much uh better
[29:02] incentive structure because if you're on
[29:05] a mining Farm um you have to have you
[29:08] have to pay rent you have to pay of
[29:11] course the electricity you have to pay
[29:13] the staff and you have to write off the
[29:15] Bitcoin miners but for example if you
[29:18] now uh build a new house and you have
[29:21] the option to pay $60,000 for a central
[29:25] heating system with a heat pump or you
[29:27] pay
[29:28] 15,000 for some Bitcoin heaters or
[29:31] 10,000 for some Bitcoin heaters and then
[29:33] have way lower uh running costs then
[29:36] with the central heating system it's
[29:38] hard to beat in that case and you don't
[29:40] have to pay rent you don't have to pay
[29:43] stuff and uh you have to pay for the
[29:45] energy anyway because you need the heat
[29:49] to heat so in total I think the
[29:52] incentive model is like that that over
[29:55] the long run I think it will take a lot
[29:57] of of years but I think in 10 years
[30:00] maybe we have a significant U percentage
[30:03] of hash rate
[30:06] decentralized uh in private resident
[30:09] houses where the people uh Heat their
[30:12] home or heat the warm water all year
[30:16] around so and I think um that's way more
[30:20] in in align with the Bitcoin OS
[30:24] decentralized Bitcoin mining and I think
[30:27] we are moving there in the future and
[30:30] yeah I'm super excited about that and
[30:33] try to build as much uh stuff exactly
[30:37] for that use case should should every
[30:40] Bitcoin should every hardcore bitcoiner
[30:42] mine mine Bitcoin or like when does it
[30:46] make sense to to actually mine Bitcoin
[30:48] outside of using the heat I Bitcoin is
[30:52] the most powerful Network by far so I if
[30:57] you're not in Bitcoin mining I think
[30:59] it's fine if you don't mine Bitcoin if
[31:01] you hardcore into Bitcoin and you want
[31:04] to uh get every single aspect of it
[31:06] you're running your full node you're
[31:08] running your lightning Noe and you want
[31:09] to run uh Bitcoin miner of course that's
[31:13] that's an awesome way and I would
[31:15] definitely support that but I don't
[31:17] think that every single bitcoiner has to
[31:19] run uh a Bitcoin minor no I don't think
[31:22] that um but I think we will definitely
[31:25] move into the right direction and
[31:27] decentralize combining more and more a
[31:29] big problem is also um you you don't you
[31:34] don't have access to cheap electricity
[31:36] you you might not want to deal with the
[31:38] problems like if the devices needs to
[31:41] repair something like you don't want to
[31:43] repair it because you don't know how to
[31:44] do it um how do you look at things like
[31:47] Bitcoin mining as a service where
[31:50] someone just takes over uh you for you
[31:52] that and and you just pay them the the
[31:55] device and you can rent them out like
[31:57] they're different kind of models for
[31:58] that like there probably I think seen
[32:00] like six providers already uh for that
[32:04] in in some sort sense how do you look at
[32:06] that thing of someone says like oh I I
[32:09] have my Bitcoin stack I'm really uh
[32:11] satisfied with that but maybe I want to
[32:13] put now I don't know 20,000 in the
[32:15] Bitcoin mining is a service thing to
[32:17] have some maybe even passive income uh
[32:21] for that does that make any sense or is
[32:24] it way better to just put your money in
[32:26] Bitcoin I think it always depends uh to
[32:29] your risk model also to your uh tax loss
[32:33] in your country also that can make a big
[32:36] big difference um in general it's of
[32:40] course much more risky you have several
[32:43] um different counterparties maybe
[32:45] counterparties you don't even know of if
[32:48] they if your Bitcoin mining hosting
[32:51] provider is uh only rents his mining
[32:55] Farms as well in some other count
[32:58] I think you have a lot of risk factors
[33:00] you maybe are not aware of and
[33:03] often these um mining Farms where they
[33:06] get super cheap electricity are in in in
[33:11] country countries where you also have
[33:14] probably additional risk factors from
[33:16] the authorities maybe they can shut down
[33:18] your mining farm and maybe they can um
[33:22] you get problems problems at Customs
[33:25] when you buy the miners like there are
[33:27] lot of uh bad stories out there but of
[33:30] course there are also a lot of good
[33:32] stories out there it totally depends are
[33:34] you trusting your uh hosting provider
[33:37] 100% are you trusting the the country
[33:42] where the hosting provider mines Bitcoin
[33:46] um if you keep uh everything in in mind
[33:50] and you're still fine with that decision
[33:51] and taking the risk of course it can be
[33:54] a a good thing but um mining like the
[33:58] hosting provider of course does it
[33:59] because he wants to earn money so you
[34:01] have definitely some counterparties
[34:03] which earn money with you and it can
[34:05] make sense if make more sense don't take
[34:09] the risk just let the Bitcoin uh huddle
[34:13] and uh or heat your home with Bitcoin
[34:16] heaters and that's totally dependent on
[34:18] your risk profile of course absolutely
[34:21] yeah it's also interesting as you have a
[34:23] Bitcoin company and uh I talked about
[34:26] that many times on the podcast where
[34:29] where bit building a Bitcoin startup
[34:32] maybe has a different kind of um
[34:34] challenge to it because uh all the
[34:38] Bitcoin investors have Bitcoin and it's
[34:41] a pretty big hurdle rate to overstep as
[34:43] a startup to grow faster than Bitcoin um
[34:47] and then if you have a company you also
[34:49] probably have a Bitcoin treasury uh then
[34:52] you Al always have to make like do I
[34:54] invest in that project or do I just put
[34:57] it on my Bitcoin balance sheet what is a
[34:59] better decision how do you balance that
[35:02] as uh in a company me exactly the same
[35:06] like I I had to make the decision
[35:09] 2022 um do I want to huddle or do I want
[35:12] to invest in my own startup with the
[35:15] Benchmark of the Bitcoin performance and
[35:19] I thought like the I thought if
[35:22] everybody would think like ah I don't
[35:24] create want to build a Bitcoin startup
[35:28] because um maybe I don't outperform
[35:30] Bitcoin then we would have a problem
[35:32] because if nobody's building on top of
[35:34] Bitcoin and don't bring new use cases
[35:37] new hardware new uh ways to use Bitcoin
[35:42] or solve problems with Bitcoin or
[35:44] Bitcoin mining um then probably the
[35:47] adoption would happen much slower so I
[35:51] think if as a startup you bring
[35:54] additional value onto the layer of
[35:56] Bitcoin um you should theoretically
[36:00] outperform uh the Bitcoin price and
[36:03] that's the reason I said let's do it I
[36:06] invested a little bit of course of my
[36:09] Bitcoin stack into the startup to fund
[36:12] it at the beginning myself and don't
[36:14] give away Equity too
[36:16] early and until now um it's like exactly
[36:20] 24 months we having the startup it
[36:23] worked out really really well we did a
[36:26] funding round this year with an
[36:28] evaluation of over 7 million EUR and at
[36:31] the moment we outperformed Bitcoin by
[36:34] quite a big margin but it's of course
[36:38] um count countless numbers of night
[36:42] shifts developing new uh Hardware doing
[36:45] dust runs it's amazing good energy in
[36:49] the team like if you go to a Bitcoin
[36:51] conference everybody is like in that
[36:53] super good mood um we're going somewhere
[36:55] new everybody is excited
[36:58] and often times I have the feeling at
[37:01] the moment more the general consensus is
[37:04] it's not that good anymore or the the
[37:08] people are not that happy at at the
[37:09] moment um with all the crisis we have in
[37:12] the world but it's always a completely
[37:14] different uh at a Bitcoin conference and
[37:17] we have it in the team as well like
[37:19] there is so much good energy and we push
[37:21] things forward and people work way more
[37:24] hours than they would have to and
[37:26] everybody is super happy um to push
[37:29] things forward and we have a lot of
[37:32] applications um people wanting to work
[37:34] for us so in total it was the best
[37:38] decision ever to start the Bitcoin uh
[37:41] startup and I'm super happy and this we
[37:45] are still thinking that we are
[37:46] completely at the beginning Bitcoin
[37:48] heating I think will be a really really
[37:52] big um New Branch but um and there is a
[37:58] lot of room for competitors and of
[38:00] course we try to take advantage of our
[38:03] first move advantage and build cool uh
[38:07] stuff um and additional value onto the
[38:10] Bitcoin layer on top it's fascinating
[38:13] being in Bitcoin I was before in it
[38:16] security and I was also there at
[38:19] conferences smaller ones uh with a high
[38:22] class uh audience but also like bigger
[38:24] ones with like all sorts of audience
[38:28] and the huge difference is the people
[38:33] seems to be actually interested and
[38:35] actually gathered around the booths uh
[38:38] like in it security yes there also
[38:40] people coming to a booth and people are
[38:42] interested in in companies but not at
[38:45] the same level as a Bitcoin and
[38:46] sometimes I go uh because I never have a
[38:49] booth I'm I'm just like as as as a
[38:51] speaker there a podcaster there but uh I
[38:55] just go sometimes through the booth area
[38:57] and I'm like oh it's like so full like
[38:59] and people are lining up in front of
[39:01] poofs and like that if you come from a
[39:03] traditional I don't know it security or
[39:05] whatever industry you come from that's
[39:08] that's unprecedent like you you you
[39:10] don't usually see that and and my
[39:11] insight from the previous conference is
[39:13] like oh like Bitcoin is really different
[39:16] there's a different why because everyone
[39:17] that is at the Bitcoin conference
[39:19] actually is therefore a personal reason
[39:23] uh it's like there are not a lot of
[39:25] people forced their because of the
[39:28] company even the people that work for
[39:30] company there are usually really um
[39:34] really energetic about it really
[39:36] passionate about Bitcoin and and you can
[39:38] feel that like that's that's a that's a
[39:40] huge difference and you can really feel
[39:42] that if if you if you been in both both
[39:45] words
[39:46] before definitely we were at a lot of
[39:49] diff uh Bitcoin conferences this year
[39:52] and it's I love it because we can talk
[39:55] to so many people which are excited
[39:57] about Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining and
[39:59] Bitcoin heating but on the other side my
[40:02] voice is not used to speaking eight
[40:04] hours it's really really great but yeah
[40:07] people are so interested in uh in
[40:09] Bitcoin stuff it's it's quite amazing
[40:13] and yeah uh like we have some we are
[40:17] having some talks and conversations with
[40:20] really large companies from uh Dux and
[40:23] stuff like that free Dux companies and
[40:27] every everywhere are popping up um
[40:30] Bitcoin task forces also in the really
[40:32] large companies and that's amazing to
[40:35] see and you can also feel uh they are so
[40:38] excited they that they can now uh bring
[40:41] their passion into their traditional uh
[40:44] job and um try to get Bitcoin or Bitcoin
[40:49] mining or Bitcoin hitting implemented in
[40:52] their company and they are super excited
[40:55] um I know there's a company they have
[40:57] two Bitcoin task force one is for the
[40:59] treasury the Bitcoin treasury task force
[41:02] and there is one Bitcoin energy mining
[41:06] task force uh and it's really cool to
[41:08] see that a lot of people are taking
[41:11] their passion into their traditional job
[41:14] and pushing forward Bitcoin absolutely
[41:17] there's a lot going on aot a lot of
[41:20] things uh we don't hear on a daily basis
[41:23] about like we hear about the big Cas
[41:25] like s scient speciic the micro
[41:28] strategies like the big companies get
[41:30] getting into Bitcoin but there's a lot
[41:32] of like Middle Ground companies uh which
[41:36] are extremely bullish on bitcoin and
[41:38] they slowly getting in there they
[41:39] building the task forces uh that's kind
[41:42] of the the suddenly part that comes
[41:44] later where I'm like oh like all those
[41:46] companies are on bitcoin yeah they they
[41:48] built the foundation uh years before
[41:50] before anybody even saw that it's it's
[41:53] really great uh to see that one uh point
[41:57] to coming back to what we earlier
[41:58] discussed with with startups and uh this
[42:01] this hurdle rate of Bitcoin uh one
[42:04] question around that I have is what do
[42:06] you think fundamentally changes if our
[42:10] default currency our default asset that
[42:13] we use is no longer feat but Bitcoin so
[42:17] no longer depreciating but appreciating
[42:20] in in value um H how will it change the
[42:23] overall Venture Capital space the
[42:26] overall uh Financial space and Company
[42:29] space uh is it like a a trend to towards
[42:32] more quality uh and and less experiments
[42:36] is could that be like a a degrowth phase
[42:40] in in the economy how do you how do you
[42:41] look at that for example if you can get
[42:44] money like micro strategy for nearly 0%
[42:48] interest rate and you have an inflation
[42:50] rate of 2% you don't have to make a very
[42:53] good investment it's already enough if
[42:55] you make 3%
[42:57] 2% um returns every single year and you
[43:00] can leverage it up to hundreds of
[43:02] millions that's quite a good return so
[43:06] and if you don't have that anymore
[43:08] because we are on a Bitcoin standard and
[43:11] the humanity gets more efficient for
[43:13] example 7% every single year so let's
[43:17] say we have finished the Bitcoin
[43:18] adoption in 100 years for example and
[43:21] everybody's on the Bitcoin standard and
[43:25] then theoretically in my opinion bitco
[43:27] coin would still increase in 7% for
[43:29] example in in because the humanity gets
[43:33] more efficient 7% every single year so
[43:36] Bitcoin is still increasing in
[43:38] infinitely to 7% a year because we get
[43:41] more and more efficient maybe if we are
[43:44] on a Bitcoin standard we get way more
[43:46] faster efficient and it's 12% or
[43:48] something like that and if that's your
[43:51] benchmark I can do nothing uh and have
[43:55] 7% uh on my Bitcoin stack my hotle stack
[43:59] increases 7% in purchasing power every
[44:01] single year then you have to outperform
[44:04] that so you will be like all the
[44:08] bitcoiners are for example not buying a
[44:12] lot of new stuff because they know uh
[44:14] it's probably depreciating what they are
[44:17] buying and Bitcoin would be uh
[44:19] appreciating so and it's the same for in
[44:23] investment feces I think you would have
[44:25] much uh a much
[44:27] higher Benchmark and you would only
[44:30] invest your money where you are pretty
[44:32] certain that it that new thing will um
[44:37] bring a lot new value and on I think
[44:41] that will be in total an efficiency
[44:43] increase because at the moment if you're
[44:45] example if you're getting 100 millions
[44:48] and you only want to do 2% um returns
[44:52] you could fund a company and the company
[44:56] with 100 million
[44:57] takes up a lot of resources from our
[45:01] from and a lot of people are now working
[45:04] at that not that good company because
[45:06] they're only doing 2% or something like
[45:09] that and that takes away resources where
[45:12] we maybe could do much more efficient
[45:14] things so I think it's good that we move
[45:17] towards harder and harder money and have
[45:20] a higher and higher Benchmark so I think
[45:24] it will be it it will harden
[45:27] our society and um we will build a lot
[45:32] more very high quality stuff and people
[45:35] expect that the stuff um they spend
[45:38] their valuable Bitcoin on will last a
[45:40] very long time because otherwise it
[45:42] would be always better just to huddle
[45:45] absolutely and I also have a higher like
[45:49] even spending Bitcoin I have a higher
[45:51] standard for that like I I don't I'm not
[45:53] willing to spend Bitcoin on on anything
[45:55] else uh than like some that really gives
[45:58] me value and the fear kind of that like
[46:00] that low that High Time Prof okay like
[46:03] it's okay I will get more money like the
[46:06] mindset completely changes and things
[46:08] get more expensive anyway so I get more
[46:11] for my money if I buy now something and
[46:13] that's exactly the problem with the time
[46:16] preference and of course if we move on
[46:18] to a Bitcoin standard that would
[46:20] probably change completely absolutely
[46:23] yeah um an interesting question that uh
[46:26] just came up uh when we talked about the
[46:29] uh
[46:30] Bitcoin what is for you more important
[46:33] to watch the Bitcoin hash rate or the
[46:35] Bitcoin US dollar price the Bitcoin US
[46:38] dollar price um I think that's the main
[46:42] the Bitcoin price is the main indicator
[46:45] how the Bitcoin adoption is moving
[46:46] forward and Bitcoin mining can only
[46:50] follow the Bitcoin price if the Bitcoin
[46:53] price for example goes to $1,000
[46:55] tomorrow all the Bitcoin miners will
[46:57] shut down because Bitcoin mining is not
[46:59] profitable anymore so the Bitcoin hash
[47:02] rate in my opinion is only following the
[47:05] Bitcoin um price and so bitcoin price is
[47:10] the most important metric to watch in my
[47:13] opinion so the so the shortterm thing
[47:16] where we seen the the hash rate hitting
[47:18] alltime High while Bitcoin is like just
[47:21] like a 50% down from the last alltime
[47:24] high it's just because shortterm Bitcoin
[47:27] miners can still manage to to be
[47:29] sustainable and they are basically
[47:32] building up for that new bull cycle and
[47:35] if this does not come they they kind of
[47:37] have to shut down then like also in
[47:38] Bitcoin mining we have a lot of lot of
[47:40] Fiat money like um we have a lot of um
[47:44] Bitcoin miners which are also traded at
[47:47] NASDAQ or on stock exchanges and a lot
[47:51] of Fiat money finds their way into
[47:54] Bitcoin mining and in when there is a
[47:57] Bitcoin hype a Bitcoin Bull Run and they
[47:59] get I don't know hundreds of millions of
[48:01] dollars and these hundreds of millions
[48:03] of dollars they have to with that they
[48:06] have to start build mining Farms they
[48:08] have to buy purchase agreements from the
[48:10] Bitcoin mining manufacturers and get
[48:13] their Hardware delivered maybe one and
[48:16] one or two years after they got their
[48:18] money from the uh stock uh exchange so
[48:24] from their shares so I think you have
[48:28] always some some patterns that the money
[48:32] finds their way much later and they have
[48:34] to run their miners also when they are
[48:36] doing a loss because uh they just got
[48:40] that in investment uh in the bull run so
[48:43] yeah I have I think there is a lot of
[48:46] time don't remember the word it's you
[48:49] have an a large latency let's say like
[48:51] that because of the Fiat money and um if
[48:55] you would have 100% Bitcoin standard uh
[48:58] I think it would it would move pretty
[49:01] much in the r with the Bitcoin
[49:04] price that's interesting um also for
[49:08] this year uh a lot of things happened um
[49:13] and before we end we're already kind of
[49:14] at soon one hour um I want to get this
[49:18] also in like how do you look at that
[49:20] here from a Bitcoin standpoint we we had
[49:23] so many new things popping up this year
[49:26] that we never never had before like the
[49:27] Bitcoin EDF in America we had Bitcoin in
[49:30] Europe since a long time but in America
[49:32] in the kind of of financial country of
[49:35] the world uh it was new then we had uh
[49:38] the president talking about it we have
[49:40] so many the Haring Wars and there so
[49:42] many other things that popping up this
[49:44] year we might hit 100k this year let's
[49:46] see
[49:47] how we were already so close but yeah we
[49:50] are now down I think like to 92 or
[49:53] something like that um how do you look
[49:55] at that year what what are some your
[49:58] personal highlights in in Bitcoin I am
[50:00] bullish for Bitcoin I think I'm since
[50:04] 2021 pretty much Bitcoin only I got into
[50:07] Bitcoin 2017 with the super bull market
[50:12] back then in
[50:13] 2017 and I was always very bullish for
[50:18] Bitcoin but at the moment I don't know
[50:22] if I'm just a little bit overhyped but I
[50:24] even got more bullish because
[50:27] game theory is playing out right now in
[50:30] front of our eyes because uh the US is
[50:34] talking about Bitcoin reserves and stuff
[50:37] like that all the governments over the
[50:40] world have to think about what would
[50:42] that mean for them and I think that's
[50:45] beautiful Game Theory even though if the
[50:48] US wouldn't do it next year um all other
[50:52] countries have to think about it and
[50:55] maybe try to front run the us so I think
[50:59] there are were planted a lot of seeds in
[51:03] very important um minds and these seeds
[51:07] will hopefully grow into something very
[51:11] orange the next few years I think we we
[51:15] increased the adoption speed pretty
[51:17] drastically because of the US election
[51:20] cycle and what people were talking about
[51:22] Bitcoin and a lot of very good seeds
[51:26] were planted and I get I think the
[51:29] fruits will be um earned much later on
[51:33] yeah so love to
[51:36] see that even when you are bullish some
[51:39] things can happen and you think okay it
[51:42] may go much faster than we thought it
[51:45] could happen the Bitcoin adoption rate
[51:48] that's that's the biggest thing for me
[51:51] this year that it goes much faster than
[51:54] I thought yeah uh it's it's like the
[51:57] suddenly moment where the the biggest uh
[52:01] country or like maybe not the biggest
[52:04] depending on what metrix you're looking
[52:06] at but us definitely in the financial
[52:09] space the the most important one for the
[52:11] Western World um is all of the sudden
[52:14] talking about Bitcoin that that's that's
[52:16] huge uh and they might actually do it um
[52:19] yeah really cool thank you so much um I
[52:21] have one question that I always ask my
[52:23] guest what can we learn from you besides
[52:26] Bitcoin you love because when you are
[52:28] doing the stuff you are loving and you
[52:31] get really good at it and it's then it's
[52:34] okay if you uh work overtime because you
[52:37] love the thing anyway so that's always a
[52:40] really good investment and I'm super
[52:44] super thankful that I found a way to
[52:48] work 24/7 for the thing I love and it I
[52:52] think it's really hard to create
[52:55] additional value on bitco but Bitcoin
[52:57] mining is definitely uh one part of that
[53:01] and yeah do the stuff you love and
[53:04] Bitcoin brings so many solutions to so
[53:07] many problems we have and energy
[53:09] transition is one of them and yeah
[53:12] innovate and love do the stuff you love
[53:16] ah really cool I love that message a lot
[53:19] perfect then uh our entain is in the
[53:21] podcast where the previous guest is
[53:23] asking a question for the next guest
[53:24] without knowing who the next guest
[53:26] actually is the question for you is what
[53:28] is a time in your life that you got
[53:31] lucky outside of Bitcoin when I got
[53:34] lucky because we all because we all got
[53:36] lucky uh because we got we understood
[53:39] Bitcoin so early I think um I got lucky
[53:43] because my dad was watching with me as a
[53:47] child online poker and so I started
[53:50] playing online poker really early from
[53:52] 12 Years on I was playing online poker
[53:56] and
[53:57] that learned me so much about Game
[54:00] Theory mathematics statistics which
[54:03] helped me all uh all over my career all
[54:08] over my life and I think I got really
[54:11] really lucky that I started this bit the
[54:15] poker uh career or poker way with my dad
[54:20] very really really really
[54:22] young yeah this this this is was very
[54:25] lucky there was some I think there were
[54:27] two poker tables in El Salvador at the
[54:32] adopting Bitcoin conference I'm not a
[54:34] poker player so I obviously didn't play
[54:36] because I don't want to lose my
[54:39] sets but I played a lot of Chess there
[54:42] it was really fun uh the El Salvador El
[54:44] Salvador Bitcoin conference I can
[54:45] recommend to everybody it's a long trip
[54:48] for Austra because I was I think on the
[54:51] road for like 24 hours something like
[54:54] that a long flight layovers in stuff
[54:56] like that but it's definitely worth it I
