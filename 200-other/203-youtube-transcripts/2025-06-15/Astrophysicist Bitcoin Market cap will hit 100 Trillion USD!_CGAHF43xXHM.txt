[00:00] we're going to have one Global monetary
[00:01] system it's going to be Bitcoin then
[00:03] theoretically it would be of order $100
[00:05] trillion both Mo's law that drives
[00:08] technology and medcaps law that drives
[00:11] Communications come to play so he had 13
[00:14] million for the midpoint I would regress
[00:16] to 9 million we see adoption growing for
[00:18] companies for Pension funds Sovereign
[00:20] wealth funds and eventually as National
[00:23] treasury there's an inevitability about
[00:25] Bitcoin this is just further data
[00:27] support for the fact that indeed it's a
[00:30] power law when would that power law
[00:32] suggest that Bitcoin gets to a gold
[00:35] market cap it's Superior monetary
[00:37] technology that's not saying it's going
[00:39] to saturate the Power log goes up
[00:40] forever with 30 trillion you reach the
[00:42] knee at 2035 and around a million
[00:46] [Music]
[00:48] bucks before we start into uh where you
[00:52] see Power law S curves Lindy effect and
[00:55] also really interesting I found that the
[00:57] last point that you made with Bitcoin is
[01:00] specialized AI for money that I never
[01:02] heard that in that sense that is really
[01:04] interesting also um just give us your
[01:08] personal view like why is Bitcoin so
[01:10] important for you personally and then
[01:12] let's get into the
[01:14] presentation okay look uh my interest in
[01:19] Bitcoin comes uh I think from a few
[01:22] angles you know when I was very young we
[01:25] had silver coins circulating and I would
[01:27] go to the bank and you could you know
[01:29] give them some paper money and you would
[01:31] get silver coins this was before 1964 in
[01:35] the US and so I was a coin collector
[01:38] then and and even later and so I was
[01:41] sort of interested in the history of
[01:42] money and uh later became interested in
[01:45] markets and so
[01:47] forth but uh the more recent interest in
[01:50] Bitcoin came about because I have a
[01:53] background in hyperformance Computing in
[01:55] supercomputing and in
[01:57] technology and so naturally it was a
[01:59] technology that I would want to look
[02:02] at and then I had some personal
[02:04] motivation
[02:06] because I have two young children and so
[02:10] I went from you know having one or two
[02:14] mouse to feed to many Mouse to feed and
[02:17] so I had to think about how can I stay
[02:20] ahead for their education and and have
[02:23] enough money for their educational
[02:25] fund and as part of the technology over
[02:30] work that I do at at Orion x uh at one
[02:33] point we were looking at yeah should we
[02:36] focus more on AI issues should we focus
[02:39] more on certain other issues and I
[02:41] thought I would pickit Bitcoin to drill
[02:44] down on you know amongst our pool of
[02:47] analysts because I didn't think the
[02:49] others were going to drill down as far
[02:50] on that and when I started to look at it
[02:54] uh really with the white paper the white
[02:56] paper is what pilled me uh because when
[02:59] I saw
[03:00] equations eight and nine I think they
[03:02] are in the white paper but whatever they
[03:05] are that uh show that how difficult it
[03:10] is it becomes exponentially harder as
[03:12] you add blocks to the
[03:14] blockchain then I said oh this is
[03:16] something
[03:17] real and so I I started using Bitcoin in
[03:20] late 2014 that's when I had my first
[03:22] purchases so it's almost 10 years and
[03:25] initially I used it to transfer money
[03:28] between the US and Thailand
[03:30] it was a faster less expensive way to
[03:32] move money for international
[03:35] transfers unfortunately too much of what
[03:38] I brought over I I then sold you know
[03:40] for for living expenses I should have
[03:42] held more than I did but I started you
[03:45] know getting deeper and deeper and going
[03:47] down into the rabbit hole and I would
[03:50] say I became a Maxim maximalist in late
[03:54] 2017 because of the hard forks and the
[03:57] blockchain wars and and uh have been on
[04:01] the maximal side ever since I I saw bch
[04:04] and bsv is is dividends to be collected
[04:06] and then sold and that showed me really
[04:10] the the long-term survivability of
[04:12] Bitcoin was proved in the marketplace by
[04:15] the really interesting so you used
[04:17] actually Bitcoin first as a as a payment
[04:20] Network to transfer money uh I think
[04:22] most people come in first for the store
[04:24] of value and then kind of see like oh
[04:27] you can actually it's like a payment
[04:28] Network and is it important for you to
[04:31] to use it as like the medium of exchange
[04:33] to steer up some some of the circular
[04:36] economies yeah not so much
[04:39] now you know I really am more interested
[04:41] in the store of value world for
[04:43] long-term value uh look if if you want
[04:47] to buy coffee use
[04:49] Fiat Fiat is depreciating right so I
[04:53] mean I think it's great we have to
[04:54] develop these uh second layer Solutions
[04:57] and uh I want to see the lightning
[04:59] Network grow out and I want to see the
[05:01] other second layer Solutions grow out
[05:04] and we want to see more Merchants
[05:05] adopting usage and that's going to be
[05:08] great and it would be nice that you know
[05:11] we could more
[05:12] conveniently have other Bitcoin balances
[05:15] you know that we can hold on to it and
[05:18] spend but at this point uh it's a store
[05:21] of value where the focus is and where my
[05:24] modeling and and research
[05:26] focuses really cool perfect then uh I
[05:29] think we we can directly get into your
[05:32] slides that you prepared because they
[05:34] are really nice and and I would like to
[05:36] to learn more about that and maybe
[05:38] afterwards uh some questions and uh some
[05:41] some more diving into that um and the
[05:44] slides that I saw is like really
[05:46] interesting with because of the power
[05:48] law more and more people become
[05:50] interested in this power law I think
[05:52] giovan was kind of the the first one
[05:54] that I saw right uh that that talked
[05:57] about it he was on the podcast uh
[05:59] recently also Fred Krueger was on the
[06:01] podcast he's also um someone of an
[06:03] advocate for for the power law uh so so
[06:07] why is the the power law uh so
[06:09] intriguing for you and uh then you can
[06:11] also start sharing uh your your
[06:14] presentation okay well I uh you know I
[06:18] was looking at the models uh in that
[06:21] sort of period you know from say 2016
[06:25] through
[06:26] 2019 you know I looked at the stf model
[06:29] as other people did and I knew it was
[06:32] problematic I knew that it was going to
[06:35] to blow it up at some point because it's
[06:37] a Divergent model and in fact it really
[06:41] is an exponential model in the limit uh
[06:44] that masquerades is a power law
[06:46] because essentially it's something that
[06:49] looks like roughly two to the cube right
[06:51] and you Converge on that and that is
[06:54] exponential
[06:55] growth so I was concerned about that and
[06:58] I was looking around for
[07:00] Alternatives and so the two Alternatives
[07:03] I looked at one was an integral form of
[07:05] of the stock to flow model instead of
[07:07] looking at the differential stock to
[07:10] flow look at all the future flow that's
[07:13] yet to be mined look at it like a goal
[07:15] mine that has reserves and I tried to
[07:18] build model called the future supply
[07:20] model and uh it was okay it could fit
[07:23] the data but it was too conservative it
[07:26] would have you saturate at a market cap
[07:29] of something like one or two trillion
[07:32] and uh the way it was projecting at the
[07:34] time and then I came across uh HC Burger
[07:40] once uh a tweet that he had that had a
[07:44] power law model essentially and that was
[07:47] how I first saw it and I started working
[07:49] with it and that was in late 2019 so
[07:52] that's about five years ago I was not
[07:54] aware of uh giovan's Discovery at that
[07:58] time only came where a later actually
[08:01] because of Fred I was the one that
[08:03] introduced Fred to the power law idea
[08:05] because I sent him a chart that was
[08:08] actually a log log plot and when he saw
[08:10] that with a straight line he said wow
[08:12] I've never seen anything like this in
[08:15] all my years of investing and then
[08:17] Giovani raised his hand and said hey you
[08:19] know I introduced that to the world 10
[08:21] years ago you know so Giovani I already
[08:24] knew Fred but now Giovani and I have
[08:27] become friends as well through all of
[08:29] that so we certainly uh appreciate that
[08:32] he was the discoverer of the power law
[08:35] but it so I looked at that I've looked
[08:38] at scurve not the logistic type but
[08:41] something that's a little more uh
[08:43] nuanced which is the wble cumulative
[08:46] distribution function and I was the
[08:49] first one to apply that sort of model
[08:52] and what you find is that in the early
[08:55] years that that reduces to a power law
[08:58] that becomes exactly power form it adds
[09:01] one parameter which is some sort of
[09:03] ultimate topping out value which could
[09:05] be in market cap or price and so I was
[09:08] looking at to see if you know is the
[09:11] power LW running out is it going to
[09:12] saturate and if it is going to saturate
[09:15] how far out would that be and right now
[09:17] we haven't uh reached saturation you
[09:20] know we seem to be nowhere near that
[09:22] which is
[09:23] encouraging and uh we'll look at some
[09:26] slides on that oh really cool just for
[09:28] um maybe people that are not aware or
[09:30] newer to the space uh you mentioned
[09:32] stock to flow also uh can you give us uh
[09:36] quick summary of that like what what's
[09:37] the stock to flow and and where did it
[09:40] origin sure well stock to flow from Plan
[09:43] B is was is basically an inflation model
[09:46] it's tied
[09:47] to how much new Bitcoin Supply there is
[09:50] in a given year say and so it's the
[09:53] inverse of inflation the stock to flow
[09:55] ratio so right now you know before the
[09:58] having it was is about
[10:00] 1.8% I believe uh right
[10:03] now uh you know it's well under
[10:08] 1% and my view is that it may have been
[10:11] relevant through the first two to three
[10:14] Cycles but once the inflation drops
[10:18] below 1% it's kind of who cares it's so
[10:21] small that it doesn't influence things
[10:25] uh right now if you took the original
[10:27] stock to flow model
[10:29] uh you would have a stock to flow of
[10:32] 120 which corresponds to an inflation
[10:36] rate of
[10:37] 0.8% the
[10:39] inverse and if you took his original
[10:42] model you would Cube that multiplied by
[10:44] a coefficient of
[10:46] 0.4 and you would have a value of
[10:48] something like $700,000 for Bitcoin so
[10:52] it's off by more than an order magnitude
[10:55] I think it's fair to say that the model
[10:56] is broken by interesting I think the the
[10:59] power law is also really interesting
[11:01] because it has those bands around it and
[11:04] that is a pretty big thing when would
[11:06] you say like what has to happen to
[11:08] bitcoin from Price action that it breaks
[11:12] either to the upside or downside like um
[11:15] the there for like if if it should break
[11:17] in the next year what price should it
[11:20] reach an upset and downside maybe also
[11:22] get let's get in the slides and and see
[11:25] where it original get some explanation
[11:27] we'll show yeah we'll show some of that
[11:30] and uh I I can talk to that uh right now
[11:34] the standard deviation is something like
[11:37] a multiplicative factor of 1.7
[11:42] 1.74 and uh we we're going to see that
[11:45] it's asymmetrical that you can move up
[11:47] two standard deviations more easily than
[11:50] you can move down in fact we've never
[11:51] moved down two standard deviations and
[11:55] we do these in Long space because it is
[11:57] such high volatility
[12:00] so so we'll talk to that so maybe I
[12:02] should start sharing
[12:04] slides okay Power laws of
[12:07] Bitcoin and a little quote from Richard
[12:09] fman about the truth being simpler than
[12:12] you
[12:13] think and then a little comment here
[12:16] about how can an esur be a power law and
[12:18] I will talk about that as
[12:21] well I want to talk a bit about block
[12:24] time a bit about the Lindy effect uh
[12:27] which I think is some
[12:30] for me with some sort of
[12:31] pre-philosophical motivation about the
[12:34] power law then we'll get into the
[12:37] parallel model and see how that's
[12:38] different from exponential and from
[12:41] compound annual growth and we'll look at
[12:44] it with respect to both the dollar and
[12:46] to
[12:47] gold and then we can look at the s-curve
[12:50] models if there's time we can talk about
[12:53] the Kelly Criterion for position
[12:56] sizing also I have a comparison
[12:59] to traditional supercomputers because
[13:03] Bitcoin is a
[13:05] decentralized global
[13:07] supercomputer and then I have some
[13:09] commentary about Bitcoin is a special
[13:11] purpose
[13:13] AI okay so I like to do my regressions
[13:16] in Block
[13:18] time and it turns out that right now
[13:21] there's not much difference between
[13:24] calendar time and block time but they're
[13:27] not exactly in sync as we know the
[13:30] Bitcoin blockchain started on January
[13:32] 3rd
[13:34] 2009 but our
[13:43] havingsex sync in early years than they
[13:46] are now but there is this
[13:49] offset so there is an entire calendar
[13:52] system that Satoshi
[13:54] created and which I elucidated a bit in
[13:58] an article several years ago living on
[14:00] Satoshi time what block is it uh in
[14:03] medium altcoin
[14:06] page and it was quite necessary for him
[14:09] to create this uh calendar system
[14:12] because everything had to be synced up
[14:14] and the most critical thing is as
[14:18] computer technology advances it's
[14:20] something like Moors law and hashrate is
[14:23] Advanced much faster than mois
[14:25] law then you had to worry about
[14:29] the individual block 's becoming so
[14:31] short that the network could not be seen
[14:35] so the difficulty adjustment is very
[14:36] very important and then you also have
[14:39] the having adjustment of course which is
[14:41] used to control the supply and to have
[14:44] the supply taper
[14:46] off and give you the very important
[14:48] property of having a completely finite
[14:51] asset with the 21 million
[14:54] limit so we had our most recent having
[14:57] in April of this year that was 840,000
[15:00] block height that's uh 16 block years so
[15:03] each block year is 52,500 blocks all
[15:07] block months are equal length unlike
[15:10] Gregorian calendar months and they have
[15:12] 4375 blocks so I like to use this as a
[15:16] fundamental time system for regressions
[15:19] things don't look that much different uh
[15:21] but the power L indices sometimes look a
[15:24] little bit lower so just as the
[15:26] Gregorian calber has its Earthly
[15:28] rotation and a sort of lunar Rhythm and
[15:30] a solar Rhythm so does satoshi's
[15:32] calendar because the difficulty happens
[15:35] in in sort of a lunar Fashion on fortn
[15:38] nights so we're already in anoc Satoshi
[15:44] 17 uh the next slide I want to talk
[15:46] about the Lindy effect a
[15:48] bit uh it comes from this restaurant in
[15:53] Manhattan where the comics used to hang
[15:55] out and they would observe that the ones
[15:59] who had long runs and also the shows
[16:02] that had long runs in Broadway people
[16:04] would keep showing up at the restaurant
[16:06] and so just being at the restaurant was
[16:08] an indicator of this sort of Lindy
[16:10] effect of long
[16:12] life uh they did not last forever they
[16:14] lasted about a hundred years so they
[16:16] closed uh in
[16:18] 2018 but this idea has been extended by
[16:22] others uh including TB to the idea of
[16:25] persistent
[16:26] technology and what you can do is you
[16:29] can say what's the expected future
[16:31] lifetime for
[16:33] technology and it's proportional to the
[16:36] existing lifetime so if I say Bitcoin is
[16:39] 15 years old now a little bit
[16:42] over uh 16 in Block years what's the
[16:45] Lindy proportion so how much more time
[16:49] can we sort of assume that we have ahead
[16:50] of us and so you have to come up with
[16:53] something as an estimator for this this
[16:55] P value this lendy
[16:57] proportion and if you just look at Price
[17:00] gain and use that as an estimator and
[17:01] take some geometric mean because the
[17:04] price gains are all over the map as you
[17:07] know uh you can get an estimator that's
[17:09] a geometric mean of about
[17:12] 2.4 so from that you say well it's
[17:14] survive 15 plus years it should have
[17:17] another 36 years at least ahead of
[17:19] us and uh if it makes it to 50 years it
[17:23] could have another 120 ahead so that's
[17:26] some of the antifragility of Bitcoin but
[17:29] when I first started playing with the
[17:30] power law I I referred to it as this uh
[17:34] sort of power law
[17:37] effect so I have an astrophysics
[17:39] background and Giovani has an
[17:41] astrophysics background and of course
[17:43] Fred Krueger has a math
[17:46] background why would we collectively
[17:49] think that you ought to try a power law
[17:52] model well nature loves power laws all
[17:55] of the four fundamental forces are
[17:58] indeed based on power laws gravity is a
[18:01] pure 1/ R 2 power law
[18:05] electromagnetism is a pure 1 over r s
[18:07] power law and there are two nuclear
[18:10] forces the strong nuclear force also is
[18:13] one over r
[18:15] squared at small distances and at large
[18:18] distances it has this uh very stiff
[18:21] spring like capability that keeps the
[18:23] quarks combined inside the protons and
[18:26] the
[18:27] neutrons and then the last force of the
[18:30] four fundamental ones is the weak force
[18:33] and it's got power law terms 1 over r s
[18:36] and also one over R it's also got some
[18:38] exponential terms because it's in Decay
[18:42] and this is sort of an important
[18:44] observation that exponentials are often
[18:47] associated with with Decay and we see
[18:50] this when we have booms and busts in the
[18:52] financial
[18:55] markets so I do want to show before I
[18:58] show a law I want to show an exponential
[19:01] relationship and this one is for
[19:04] NVIDIA it does not show the recent uh
[19:07] pullback in price because this
[19:10] is data point uh most recent data point
[19:13] was June 1st of the this year and also
[19:16] 10 years prior and this is a semi log
[19:19] plot so we've got log 10 of
[19:22] price uh plotted against you know the
[19:25] year after 2000 so years 14 through 24
[19:29] and it's pretty much a straight
[19:31] line uh and it it's been growing
[19:35] exponentially at 69%
[19:39] compounded now before
[19:41] 1999 uh sorry before 2014 it was rather
[19:44] flat it was growing at about
[19:46] 5% since it had gone public in 1999 but
[19:50] it really took off as everyone knows and
[19:53] it's now become basically the you know
[19:55] the most
[19:56] valuable uh publicly traded company out
[20:00] there along with
[20:04] apple we can't have this exponential
[20:06] continue to happen because a nade would
[20:09] take it to 550 trillion and that's the
[20:12] equivalent of all private wealth in the
[20:14] world so this is kind of a general
[20:17] comment on exponentials that they are
[20:19] unstable relative to power laws trees
[20:22] don't grow to the sky and this is one of
[20:25] the reasons why I was concerned about
[20:28] really in the beginning about the stock
[20:29] to flow model because I saw early on
[20:32] that it had essentially exponential
[20:36] Behavior that's interesting yeah because
[20:40] this is the thing that I Al also think
[20:42] because if
[20:44] Bitcoin like Bitcoin has two things why
[20:47] it grows the first thing is like the the
[20:49] feat
[20:50] debasement uh in in in general terms but
[20:53] then also uh the adoption is just uh
[20:57] growing like people have
[20:59] now I don't know how many people have
[21:01] Bitcoin maybe 3% depending on where you
[21:03] look maybe 10% whatever the adoption
[21:05] rate of Bitcoin is so the adoption with
[21:07] Bitcoin uh is growing but then also uh
[21:11] as an asset because we get more
[21:14] efficient with producing things and Fe
[21:16] the basement and in general um so there
[21:18] are like some some effects to the
[21:20] Bitcoin growing but the biggest the fact
[21:23] people just adopting it without knowing
[21:25] it like without without having it prior
[21:28] that's a thing the the biggest indicator
[21:31] uh the biggest growth factor for Bitcoin
[21:33] and this will vanish at some point if if
[21:36] everyone has it uh and then it will grow
[21:39] very very slowly can it cannot grow
[21:41] exponentially all the all all the time
[21:43] yeah yes uh you know adoption has been
[21:47] growing as a power law and Giovani
[21:51] realized that it
[21:53] was essentially uh meda's law that was
[21:56] coming into effect and meda's law is the
[21:59] law that relates to networking
[22:01] communication networks but also to
[22:03] social networks and that says that the
[22:06] usefulness of your
[22:07] telephone goes as a square of the number
[22:10] of other people that have telephones
[22:12] right because now you can call many more
[22:15] people in the world and this applies to
[22:18] social media networks as well now the
[22:20] more people that have Facebook the more
[22:22] people you can connect to
[22:24] potentially so that meta's law goes
[22:26] roughly as the square it too can also
[22:29] saturate because you really don't want
[22:31] to talk to everybody you just want to
[22:33] have enough people to talk to so you can
[22:36] sometimes get some in log in kind of
[22:37] behavior in there but roughly it goes as
[22:40] as a square and we're in the early
[22:42] portion of the medcafe network growth
[22:46] for Bitcoin so if you take the
[22:49] realization and the measurement that the
[22:52] number of wallets and addresses but
[22:54] roughly growing as the
[22:55] cube of the time then you find
[23:00] that uh you get something like close to
[23:03] the six power time growth for Bitcoin
[23:06] value because the network is
[23:08] growing it gets a bit more complex
[23:10] because the fat wallets don't grow as
[23:12] fast as as the wallets with with small
[23:15] amounts
[23:16] but basically both Mo's
[23:19] law that drives technology and Mets law
[23:23] that drives Communications come to play
[23:26] for the bitet Bitcoin Network
[23:30] where would you say is uh then uh the
[23:34] the the end of the power LW the end of
[23:37] the the laws where Bitcoin is kind of
[23:40] fully adopted or is almost fully
[23:45] adopted well I I mean the question
[23:49] is does it
[23:51] become the global monetary
[23:55] standard and how much of global wealth
[24:00] gets drawn into
[24:02] Bitcoin and this was my motivation
[24:05] behind these s-curves that we'll look at
[24:07] in a bit but right now the global
[24:11] M2 for all currencies is $6
[24:17] trillion uh so if you were to swap that
[24:20] all out and say we're going to have one
[24:21] Global monetary system it's going to be
[24:24] Bitcoin then theoretically it would be
[24:26] of order $100 trillion doll
[24:29] you can support the existing GDP of the
[24:31] globe which is also about1 trillion doll
[24:34] on a monetary network of about that
[24:38] value uh that's in monetary Theory
[24:41] that's the velocity of money we're
[24:43] turning over one GDP every year that's
[24:46] the definition of the veloc money is a
[24:49] ratio between GDP and
[24:52] M2 uh now some people are thinking well
[24:54] it's going to absorb all the wealth
[24:58] but that dismisses the idea that
[25:01] there'll still be real estate there'll
[25:03] still be companies and you don't sell
[25:06] companies every year and you don't sell
[25:07] your real estate every year so you can
[25:10] denominate those in Bitcoin Bitcoin can
[25:12] be the the most important monetary
[25:16] system out there and you might not have
[25:18] have to go above $100
[25:20] trillion uh in today's dollars in
[25:24] equivalent that's still a factor of a
[25:26] 100 so we've got headro yeah 100
[25:29] trillion would be massively and and of
[25:32] this 100 trillion um then there comes
[25:35] also inflation along right 100 trillion
[25:37] like 100 EX in today's terms
[25:40] right well under a Bitcoin standard
[25:43] inflation might be very low
[25:46] right but do you think that uh when we
[25:50] have a Bitcoin standard that will still
[25:51] be fear
[25:53] around I I don't know it's an open
[25:55] question I think we're going to see uh
[25:59] uh these transitions take decades the
[26:02] transition from the British pound to the
[26:05] American dollar really unfolded over
[26:08] decades in between World War I and and
[26:11] then after World War
[26:13] II in stages and the gold standard was
[26:16] involved in in that too so I think we
[26:19] have to look at something that's going
[26:20] to proceed in stages we don't know how
[26:22] it's going to
[26:24] unfold uh we've just had introduced in
[26:27] the US Congress the Bitcoin strategic
[26:30] Reserve
[26:31] bill I don't expect that's going to pass
[26:33] in the next few years but you know that
[26:35] conversation is
[26:37] starting uh so I think uh and then we're
[26:40] seeing Sovereign wealth funds in the
[26:42] Middle East and Singapore that also have
[26:44] some investment in Bitcoin we're seeing
[26:47] Pension funds uh including in the US for
[26:51] cities and states they're starting to
[26:54] put uh you know some Bitcoin as their
[26:57] Reserve positions
[26:59] so I think we see adoption growing for
[27:01] companies for p Pension funds for uh
[27:05] Sovereign wealth funds and eventually as
[27:09] National treasuries we already see that
[27:11] for El
[27:12] Salvador uh we always see uh you know a
[27:16] legal tender law for Central African
[27:19] Republic so they're going to be a bunch
[27:21] of stages it's hard to know how it falls
[27:24] out I think we're going to see cbdcs as
[27:27] well I think Europe is very committed to
[27:29] cbdc so they're going to pursue that
[27:32] path and that's going to be Fiat cbdc is
[27:34] just another form of
[27:36] Fiat and uh we'll have to see how this
[27:40] all develops but I think there's an
[27:41] inevitability about
[27:43] Bitcoin that's appropriate to the
[27:47] conditions that we live in it's Superior
[27:49] monetary
[27:51] technology and we have some very
[27:55] severe uh debt and demographic problems
[27:59] and it can be at least a partial
[28:01] solution to some of those
[28:03] problems yeah definitely I see it like
[28:06] when when we have Bitcoin as such a
[28:08] great uh Solution on on our hand uh and
[28:12] the the field system for me it only has
[28:15] the possibility to actually worsen over
[28:17] time like like the more we BR the more
[28:20] problems arise the more we we have to
[28:22] print uh the worse just the the monetary
[28:25] system gets and we see Canada this the
[28:27] US dollar is quite powerful more and
[28:30] more countries like have the US I think
[28:32] like 68 countries or something like that
[28:34] have the US dollar as their primary
[28:37] currency uh so I think smaller
[28:39] currencies will continue to fall and uh
[28:42] I don't know like I I see a world where
[28:45] actually at some point we only have a
[28:47] Bitcoin standard or a world where like
[28:51] there's only a few fear currencies that
[28:54] actually are dominating but right now we
[28:55] have a lot uh and I don't it it makes me
[29:00] uh wondering if if we ever get rid of of
[29:02] fat because even in the turkey or other
[29:04] countries where they have really high
[29:06] inflation really big problems from fat
[29:08] they still use they still use that and
[29:11] in the Fiat system so I don't know if if
[29:13] people eventually adopt
[29:17] Bitcoin governments are are loathed to
[29:19] give up control so I think the the most
[29:22] likely path is
[29:25] cbdcs uh competition between small
[29:28] countries that need to strengthen their
[29:31] currency because of the dominance
[29:34] of basically the dollar the Euro and the
[29:38] wwn and
[29:41] uh you know as people look at it and
[29:44] they say it's going up in value we ought
[29:46] to have some and so they add it at least
[29:50] as uh some strategic
[29:52] support they right now they hold foreign
[29:55] reserves which are paper which is debt
[29:58] or they hold gold and as it continues to
[30:01] Rise Against gold which it does in a
[30:03] power law fashion then they'll say well
[30:06] if we're going to hold gold maybe we
[30:08] should hold some Bitcoin as
[30:10] well really cool yeah I I think so too
[30:13] um and what's the the Lindy power law
[30:15] model that you have now well it's it's
[30:19] it's it's the power law model that
[30:20] you're familiar with but uh when I first
[30:23] started talking about it I was thinking
[30:25] about that Lindy effect of persistence
[30:28] and why do we have this power law it's
[30:30] like Bitcoin just keeps going and going
[30:33] and uh what we found is it sort of
[30:36] settled into the power law that the
[30:38] power law index fluctuated during the
[30:41] first few years and I'll show that on
[30:43] another slide and uh as time went on it
[30:46] it got sort of stronger more and more
[30:49] antifragile as a power law
[30:52] representation so these are the same
[30:54] curves except the left is a log log
[30:58] curve and the right is a semi log curve
[31:03] and they both show regression of
[31:07] price relative to the number of block
[31:10] years elapse so you can just think of it
[31:12] as a number of blocks on the in the
[31:14] blockchain or the agent block years as I
[31:17] discussed
[31:18] earlier and then the the best fit
[31:21] regression there is a power law index of
[31:24] of 5.4 if you do it in calendar years
[31:27] you get something like a
[31:29] 5.7 power law index and you can see with
[31:32] the log lock chart it just sort of leaps
[31:35] out at
[31:36] you the other point that's fairly clear
[31:39] is that the volatility is high as we all
[31:41] know if we've been in this space for you
[31:44] know even a year's
[31:46] time and uh in the semar version of the
[31:50] chart you see a representation of that
[31:53] volatility the green line and the red
[31:55] line have the plus one standard
[31:58] deviation and the minus one standard
[32:02] deviation and for the whole curve that's
[32:05] basically uh just over a factor two a
[32:08] multiplicative Factor two so if the fair
[32:11] value today were 60,000 one standard
[32:13] deviation on the upside would be
[32:17] 120,000 and on the downside would be
[32:19] 30,000 for example and what you also
[32:23] observe is that you get
[32:25] these uh booms and bust Cycles which
[32:28] have been roughly four years apart
[32:30] except for the first one and those uh
[32:33] push on through the the plus one
[32:35] standard deviation line and they reach
[32:38] up to around two standard deviations
[32:42] maximum but on the lower side we have
[32:46] strong support at minus one standard
[32:49] deviation and a lot of people have
[32:51] noticed that and they've also noticed
[32:54] that uh you know the the 48 months mon
[32:58] or 200 week or foure you know curve acts
[33:04] as a strong support and those are
[33:06] basically similar
[33:09] things uh there's another way of doing
[33:12] this which is uh called quantile
[33:14] regression the regression on the prior
[33:17] slide is ordinary leas squares
[33:19] regression but with quantile regression
[33:22] what you do is you
[33:24] basically uh regress so that you have
[33:27] levels and those levels can be you know
[33:29] the highest 5% the highest
[33:32] 10% the midline at 50% the lowest 5% the
[33:36] lowest 10% and it finds the optimal fit
[33:40] such that 5% of the data points are
[33:42] below the line and 95% or above or if
[33:46] it's the midline 50% of the data points
[33:48] are above 50 below but it is linear in
[33:53] log price versus uh log of age and again
[33:57] this is using uh block
[33:59] years and I give the equations as well
[34:02] so again on the left side we've got the
[34:04] log log chart on the right side we have
[34:07] the same set of seven curves on a semi
[34:10] log chart and we've also got
[34:12] extrapolations
[34:15] out with the log log chart I show the
[34:17] extrapolation out to 50 years of age
[34:21] which would be
[34:22] 259 and on the semi log chart I show it
[34:25] out to 30 years of age which would be uh
[34:29] roughly 20 39 these are block years so
[34:31] it happens slightly faster than that
[34:33] about a year
[34:35] faster
[34:37] and we get the same sort of
[34:40] results uh basically if you look at the
[34:44] midline which turns out to
[34:47] be
[34:48] uh basically the median regression then
[34:52] you find that it has a power law with
[34:55] index 5.44 which is similar to the Le
[34:59] squares
[35:01] regression but then if you look at these
[35:04] uh support levels which are the 0.05
[35:08] quanti the 0.1 quanti and even the 0.25
[35:12] quanti which are the three lines you
[35:15] know at the bottom in red and blue
[35:18] and what's the other one it's a green
[35:21] line they're almost on top of each other
[35:23] you see they're all very close together
[35:24] and they provide a lot of support
[35:26] similar to that
[35:28] minus one on the Z index or minus one
[35:30] standard deviation we saw before and
[35:33] those have a roughly A
[35:36] 5.6 to 5.7 power law
[35:40] index and then if we look at the tops
[35:43] that are connected at uh 0.9 quantal and
[35:47] 0.95 it's roughly a 5.0 power law
[35:51] index connecting the top so that's
[35:54] suggesting to you that the volatility is
[35:56] coming down somewhere wet that these uh
[35:59] boom and bus Cycles are not peing quite
[36:02] as high as we go from one cycle to the
[36:05] next and where would we uh like that's
[36:09] the that's probably question that Mo
[36:11] most people didn't ask when we saw this
[36:13] PO we saw lower lower quality uh quality
[36:17] volatility uh over time you said like 20
[36:21] 49 was the one model that's like 25
[36:24] years from from now if I'm I'm not I'm
[36:27] not uh I'm
[36:29] mistaken well one of these extrapolates
[36:32] out to 30 Block years which
[36:35] is
[36:37] 2038
[36:40] basically and that's the one uh on the
[36:42] right hand
[36:44] side that's the log versus linear time
[36:48] chart so it's 2048 so that's like
[36:53] um 15 years more like that 14 years 14
[36:57] years out out in in the future it's
[36:59] another 14 years that's
[37:01] correct what would you say is is um with
[37:05] with the power law with the line power
[37:06] law model and all those those things
[37:09] combined what would you say is an
[37:11] realistic price Target as an average for
[37:15] for that time
[37:17] frame
[37:19] um it it's going to be about what's
[37:23] going to be above a million dollars so
[37:25] you will see that the midline which is
[37:29] in the Scion color is around $2
[37:35] million with and the the support line is
[37:37] around $1
[37:40] million interesting there's also um
[37:44] Michael sailor is not I feel like not
[37:47] that famous for making price prediction
[37:49] but he actually made one at at the
[37:52] Bitcoin Nashville like the first time
[37:53] that I saw him actually making bull bear
[37:56] and and and think case otherwise he all
[37:59] only more talked about yeah it could go
[38:01] to that trillion of market cap but he
[38:03] never really put like a time and and
[38:06] value to it and I think his base bear
[38:10] case was like three million at uh year
[38:13] 2045 and his bull case was 49 million
[38:17] which is a big bandwith also um would
[38:21] that the power also uh would that the
[38:24] power also suggest in that bandwidth
[38:27] yes I I checked that his mid his
[38:29] midpoint was 13 million for
[38:33] 2045 and he didn't quite expose all the
[38:37] details of his model but his model
[38:39] basically had the growth rate coming
[38:42] down over time which is what happens
[38:44] with the power law and so it almost
[38:46] sounded as if he was using something
[38:48] that was qualitatively similar to power
[38:51] law so he had 13 million for the
[38:54] midpoint uh I would regress to not 9
[38:57] million so you know it's in the ballpark
[38:59] of of 10
[39:02] million yeah I think and with the with a
[39:05] wide band now he he used a band
[39:07] that's more than a factor three uh so he
[39:12] gave himself you know a lot of leeway I
[39:14] think that's not unreasonable but it's a
[39:17] bit you know it just depends on do you
[39:19] choose the 95% or the
[39:21] 99% Contours I I think if you choose the
[39:26] the one Sigma Contours that you would
[39:29] say you know a factor of less than two
[39:32] so it would be something like on the
[39:36] upside you know less than 20 million for
[39:40] the one Sigma but if you go to two Sigma
[39:43] which you do when you get you know a
[39:46] boom these exponential
[39:48] runaways uh then it then it could get up
[39:51] to that value that he suggested on the
[39:53] downside you might not be lower than
[39:58] say five million that might be your
[40:02] support yeah it's also interesting that
[40:05] you mentioned that in the powerlord that
[40:06] the the the lower bands are more um uh
[40:12] more reliable like the the the how do
[40:14] you call it resistant the the support
[40:17] line is is more reliable and it breaks a
[40:20] little bit more to the upside uh do you
[40:22] expect that to continue the bottom yeah
[40:26] uh yes I mean the the the core of the
[40:30] power law is in the support what we're
[40:32] really seeing is we're seeing a power
[40:34] law that has superimposed on it
[40:36] exponential
[40:38] Bubbles and those exponential bubbles
[40:41] are driven by these quasi periodic
[40:44] four-year
[40:46] cycles that you know historically people
[40:49] thought oh that relates to
[40:51] having other people have said it relates
[40:53] to business Cycles it seems to be driven
[40:57] a lot by
[40:58] liquidity uh people have talked about
[41:00] election Cycles but of course that's one
[41:02] country right so that can't drive
[41:05] necessarily the global Behavior but it
[41:08] does it does reflect in the behavior of
[41:11] the most important Central
[41:13] Bank and uh there is some correlation
[41:16] between liquidity cycles and you know
[41:19] the election cycle in the US so uh right
[41:23] now in fact we see that the central
[41:25] banks are pretty well coordinated
[41:27] in terms of their interest rate policies
[41:30] except for Japan they're an outlier
[41:32] but uh most of the other central banks
[41:36] are now heading you know are either
[41:38] cutting or heading towards cutting
[41:40] interest
[41:41] rates so like the the election cycle
[41:44] actually has uh an indirect uh impact in
[41:49] in that is do you think is it's it's
[41:50] coincidence that the election cycle is
[41:53] is is paired with the Bitcoin cycle uh
[41:56] to to some extent
[41:59] uh I don't think it's a complete
[42:01] coincidence but we don't have enough
[42:03] data points to have statistical
[42:07] confidence it's it's interesting for me
[42:10] like the all those memes also you
[42:12] mentioned uh like there are so many
[42:13] memes in in Bitcoin and it makes it real
[42:15] fun um you also had on one on one slide
[42:20] has been exponentially since then at uh
[42:23] 69% compound that it's it's it's it's
[42:26] crazy that we hit those me meme numbers
[42:30] at 69 or 420 sometimes in
[42:33] Bitcoin you know that was Nvidia so I
[42:37] don't know yeah that's true true
[42:42] true perfect then yeah sobering part but
[42:45] more physical than that sounds
[42:47] fun yeah so look that's the stock to
[42:51] flow says you're going to compound at
[42:54] 69%
[42:55] forever and uh
[42:58] you know between uh Giovani and Fred and
[43:02] Cena 21st capital and APS k32 we don't
[43:06] believe that we believe in the power law
[43:08] and the power law
[43:10] has a behavior where you double when you
[43:14] double the amount of time so you know
[43:17] the first Factor two could happen as you
[43:19] went from one year to two years but the
[43:22] next you know factor of whatever
[43:24] requires going from two to four years
[43:27] and then from four to 8 and then from 8
[43:29] to 16 now we're getting a lot more than
[43:30] a factor two we're getting as you double
[43:33] the time scale we're getting about two
[43:35] to the 5.7 in calendar years and that's
[43:38] more like a factor of 50 so you double
[43:42] the age of Bitcoin and you'll get a
[43:44] factor of 50 you double it again you'll
[43:46] get a factor of 50 but you had to go
[43:48] from eight to 16
[43:50] years or eight to you know s and a half
[43:53] to 15 years to get one factor 50 now
[43:56] you've got to go from age 15 to age 30
[43:59] to get the next Factor 50 so sorry to
[44:03] say the compound annual growth rate is
[44:06] going
[44:08] down but you can calculate directly from
[44:11] the power law what that expected gain in
[44:15] the fair value is over time and it's in
[44:18] the third bullet and it's just B Block
[44:22] years plus one divided by B so if I'm at
[44:25] 16 block years now now I add one I take
[44:29] the ratio 17 to over 16 I raise that to
[44:33] the power of K which is about 5.4 and I
[44:37] find it's 39% for the next block year
[44:40] and then I find for the year after you
[44:43] know it's a slightly smaller number 37%
[44:46] and so forth so it's slowing but it is
[44:49] still a phenomenal
[44:52] return and as you know it's much better
[44:54] than anything we're getting from NASDAQ
[44:56] and from S&P or from European stocks
[45:02] Etc it's really interesting for me when
[45:04] because I come from the stock world uh I
[45:06] come from Stock Investing and picking
[45:09] stocks and this was a lot of fun for me
[45:11] uh to be honest and it returned a lot of
[45:15] uh gains uh but I realized that Bitcoin
[45:19] is right now the the the from a risk
[45:23] reward basis just the the best bet I can
[45:26] take for the next couple five maybe 10
[45:29] years but I think at some point we we
[45:32] come to the point of Bitcoin being
[45:33] mature enough that there might be an
[45:36] incentive to go out with my time again
[45:40] and find amazing companies that I can
[45:42] invest there is also the incentive to do
[45:44] that now there might be companies that
[45:46] outgrow uh Bitcoin but right now my
[45:50] focus fully on bitcoin that might change
[45:52] in 10 20 years so is is would you say is
[45:57] there is there point where you say like
[46:00] Bitcoin from an investment standpoint
[46:04] and not just saving because right now
[46:06] it's kind of we always say like Bitcoin
[46:08] is saving but it's also getting adopted
[46:10] so quickly so that it's it kind of makes
[46:13] sense as an uh future bet as an
[46:16] investment vehicle where would you say
[46:19] is the the point where the the returns
[46:22] are diminishing so much that it is still
[46:25] the best form of of money the best form
[46:28] of saving your financial energy but it
[46:30] makes sense to allocate something for
[46:33] investing back in something with more
[46:36] risk like stocks like something else is
[46:39] there did you have do you have a
[46:41] framework around that sure it's the
[46:44] power
[46:44] law so all we have to do is we just you
[46:49] know we just plug in the time
[46:54] ratio raise it to that
[46:58] power uh or a simple way to look at it
[47:01] is you just take 1 plus one over the
[47:06] age of
[47:08] Bitcoin you take that quantity one plus
[47:10] one over the age of Bitcoin and raise it
[47:14] to the power K which in calendar years
[47:17] is is you know
[47:21] 5.7 so you know pick a year in the
[47:23] future let's say
[47:25] 2040 so in
[47:28] 2040 Bitcoin will be
[47:30] 31 so all we have to do is divide 1 into
[47:34] 31 add one we've got
[47:39] 1.032 and we raise that to the 5.7
[47:48] power and we get a return of 19.8%
[47:54] perom so if you think you can do better
[47:57] than that with stock picking then you
[47:58] might start doing some stock picking
[48:01] again in that time frame but we're going
[48:04] to be above
[48:08] 20% for another 15
[48:11] years and that's amazing 20 years 20%
[48:15] depending on like if if you don't have
[48:17] hyper inflation but then the power also
[48:19] like gets up is is is that a thing when
[48:24] we uh we have a scenario where like the
[48:27] US dollar or like the world is getting
[48:30] into like a
[48:32] hyperinflation um scenario situation
[48:34] where where the power kind of breaks
[48:36] because then we have an extreme
[48:40] situation it it's possible certainly I
[48:43] mean if if you had steady
[48:47] inflation above 10% Moder even moderate
[48:51] hyperinflation then you might see the
[48:53] power law Index steepen right
[48:57] because Bitcoin should go up more if the
[49:02] dollar is depreciating
[49:04] faster and one way to get a feel of that
[49:07] is to look at gold also which we'll do
[49:09] in another chart the in the intent here
[49:12] is that uh this is useful as long as the
[49:17] expected fair value gain is much larger
[49:19] than the inflation and what we know is
[49:22] that you know decade after decade the US
[49:26] M2 money supply grows at about 7% per
[49:30] year so as long as we've got an expected
[49:33] return that's in the 30 percentiles or
[49:35] 20 percentiles is much much larger and
[49:39] that inflation is a second order effect
[49:42] but if that inflation you know were
[49:45] consistently 12 15 18% for some
[49:49] reason uh then you you'd expect to see
[49:53] the return in dollar terms to be even
[49:56] higher
[49:58] uh but what we do expect also is that
[50:00] Bitcoin is going to continue to get and
[50:02] gold would do well right potentially
[50:04] under such a scenario it should at least
[50:07] hold its value roughly over long time
[50:09] frames but we would expect Bitcoin to
[50:12] continue to better than gold because
[50:15] it's attracting more and more people
[50:16] into the network and we're getting that
[50:19] benefit of the network effect of Met's
[50:21] law if you watch or listen to my podcast
[50:24] on a regular basis I'll guess you
[50:26] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[50:29] most important step is to keep the
[50:31] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[50:34] wallet my personal recommendation for
[50:36] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[50:39] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[50:41] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[50:43] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[50:46] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[50:50] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[50:54] robobin to get your bitbox and if you if
[50:56] you really want to bulletproof your self
[50:59] custody setup your security setup and
[51:01] maybe even your citizenship setup you
[51:04] have to talk to the Bitcoin way if you
[51:07] go to the Bitcoin way.com
[51:10] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[51:13] free call where you can dive deep with
[51:16] them if your self custody setup is
[51:19] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[51:22] maybe might be improvable or your
[51:24] digital footprint in general is secure
[51:28] they are the experts in cyber security
[51:31] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[51:34] secure sovereign individual in
[51:38] general yeah that that's interesting
[51:40] looking at uh the gold instead of US
[51:44] dollars from a power perspective I don't
[51:47] think I'd dwell on this too long this
[51:50] these are the zc scores so this is the
[51:52] number of standard deviations above and
[51:54] below we sort of talked about the a bit
[51:57] already uh this only goes back about 10
[52:00] years so it's not showing the the first
[52:02] six years so we're seeing the two large
[52:06] Peaks that
[52:08] happened after the second having it year
[52:12] block year eight and after the third
[52:14] having at block year 12 where we had
[52:17] sort of a double Peak and in both cases
[52:20] you know it peaked out with zc scores
[52:22] around two or two standard deviations
[52:25] upward and and it also
[52:28] bottomed in three instances at slightly
[52:31] less than minus1 zcore minus one
[52:35] standard deviation on the
[52:38] downside so what we say is we have
[52:40] convexity because we have a highly
[52:42] favorable risk to reward
[52:44] ratio uh more upside than downside right
[52:48] what's the what's the C score sorry the
[52:51] uh Z is just the number of standard
[52:53] deviations above or below trend
[52:56] and again the standard deviations are
[52:59] measured
[53:01] logarithmically uh so the see if I have
[53:04] the number
[53:06] here uh
[53:08] multiplicatively one standard deviation
[53:10] is a factor of 1.74
[53:13] multiplicatively but in log 10 terms
[53:16] it's a value of about I think 0.
[53:19] 253 so in other words will'll be the log
[53:23] of the price will either be
[53:26] 0.25 below or 0.25 above in long terms
[53:31] or if it goes to Z of two it'll be 0.5
[53:33] above and 0 five above is a factor
[53:39] three so the price might
[53:42] drop by a factor 1.7 but it might go up
[53:45] to Z equal 2 which is a factor of 1.7
[53:48] squared
[53:50] higher so quite a bit more headro and
[53:53] this particular
[53:54] time uh when I did this
[53:58] the model Trend was at
[54:01] 60,000 and so the downside price was
[54:03] 29,000 but the upside price was
[54:07] 211,000 and that's not so different from
[54:10] where we are now we're we have a
[54:12] somewhat similar situation
[54:16] now this was updated to I think a month
[54:18] ago
[54:20] so so it's it's kind of there's yes so
[54:25] it's kind of shows the the the
[54:28] volatility of of
[54:33] it it it shows the volatility and it
[54:36] also shows the skew to the right tail oh
[54:39] okay okay
[54:40] okay so any you know you spend uh a you
[54:45] notice you'll spend a lot of time around
[54:47] zero between point minus5 and 0.5 and
[54:51] you'll actually spend more time hugging
[54:53] the minus one line than you'll spend at
[54:55] the 02 Peaks but you have those Peaks
[54:58] available to you and you have uh a fair
[55:01] number of data points between 1.0 and
[55:05] 2.0 and that's when you know the price
[55:07] gets quite
[55:09] extended but those that's when it's in
[55:11] the exponential phase and those bubbles
[55:14] are also unsustainable for very
[55:20] long there's another way of looking at
[55:22] it and apsk k32 has has promoted this
[55:28] View and you can look at things in terms
[55:31] of lead and
[55:33] lag uh so how many years or months does
[55:37] price lead or lag the main trend of the
[55:40] parallel
[55:42] model so for example on July 31st when
[55:45] the price was up at
[55:47] 66,000 a little bit higher than it is
[55:50] today and I'm kind of glad we're having
[55:53] this on a a crash day because I want
[55:55] everybody to think in log terms not in
[55:58] linear terms and to look at these uh
[56:02] charts and
[56:03] graphs particularly the log log graphs
[56:06] and then you can calm down a bit you'll
[56:07] see that in log log terms the price
[56:11] hasn't moved all that much
[56:15] but just a few days ago uh when we were
[56:19] 66,000 we were ahead of the model by
[56:21] about 3.7
[56:25] months and
[56:26] and this chart with the zigzag shows the
[56:30] number of block years ahead or behind
[56:33] that you are and you find it can go as
[56:36] much as three years ahead when you get
[56:38] into the
[56:40] bubbles or it can be as much as a year
[56:42] or more
[56:45] lagging if I look right now it looks
[56:47] like we're with our little crash that
[56:50] we've had down to around 53,000 I'm not
[56:53] sure what the very latest price is we're
[56:55] about uh five months lagging right now
[56:58] so we're
[56:59] below the trend value for
[57:01] the regression in Block years
[57:05] interesting and just a quick note
[57:07] because we are uh recording now on
[57:10] August 5th on a Monday at least for me
[57:12] now on my in my time zone uh so it will
[57:16] be probably released on Saturday uh this
[57:18] week so in in six days maybe that Bry
[57:23] Bry already made some other moves let's
[57:25] see maybe it's a crazy week in in ahead
[57:27] of us uh but it's it's interesting so
[57:30] like at the current price rate 53,000 or
[57:33] what we have we lagging so it it would
[57:36] be kind of a Buy Signal but it's it's
[57:39] like if you really believe in
[57:41] Bitcoin also three months ahead is a Buy
[57:45] Signal
[57:47] correct I I think that's exactly the
[57:49] right way to look at it so we've got a
[57:51] better buy today than we had on July
[57:53] 31st but you know as long as your time
[57:56] Horizon is more than four months you are
[57:59] still uh you know reasonable to buy on
[58:01] July
[58:03] 31st and then there's a histogram and it
[58:05] shows the distribution and what you find
[58:08] is you know you have this right tail so
[58:11] you have uh some data points with leads
[58:14] of two to three or more years but the
[58:18] lag you know never exceeds two years and
[58:21] rarely exceeds one and a half years so
[58:25] that's another example for this
[58:28] skew short short question here um yes is
[58:32] there some um website or some somewhere
[58:36] where you can so like uh there we can
[58:39] see if if you're lagging or or leading I
[58:42] think that's an interesting met to look
[58:44] at for for
[58:46] people I would follow apsk 32 for that
[58:50] because he's been posting on that on his
[58:54] uh Twitter account
[58:57] and he's doing it in calendar years I do
[58:59] it in Block years but you'll see roughly
[59:01] similar
[59:03] results and you know I will occasionally
[59:06] tweet about it I tweeted something about
[59:08] it
[59:09] today uh I will occasionally put an
[59:12] article on on Twitter or in substack
[59:15] about these
[59:18] things really cool thank
[59:22] you so the the next slide is
[59:28] does Bitcoin behave as an exponential or
[59:30] a power loss so this is just further
[59:32] data support for the fact that indeed
[59:37] uh it's a power law we do
[59:40] have returns that come down over time
[59:44] and we do have uh volatility that comes
[59:48] down over time that's a model free
[59:52] statement and what I've done is I've
[59:54] just taken for the the four epics that
[59:57] we had to block year four block year 8
[59:59] 12 and and now 16 which was the having
[60:02] in April I've said what was the average
[60:06] monthly return by
[60:08] epic and you can see that it dropped
[60:11] from 30% in the first epic down to below
[60:15] 10% in the completed fourth epic we're
[60:19] now in the fifth epic and the
[60:22] volatility this is the standard
[60:24] deviation in that epic of monthly
[60:27] returns dropped from
[60:30] 80% down to about 25% so it's both have
[60:34] come down
[60:36] substantially if you had exponential
[60:38] return constant compound annual growth
[60:41] both lines would be
[60:42] straight and in reality they both fell
[60:47] monotonically and
[60:49] considerably and I can model the
[60:52] standard deviation what that should be
[60:55] with the Power log as well if I make
[60:57] some assumptions about some contribution
[61:00] from the Bubbles as well some basically
[61:04] something that looks like a diffusion
[61:05] equation so i' I've got an article on
[61:09] that the next thing is on
[61:12] gold so this is uh a semilog
[61:17] graph this is a the log of the number of
[61:21] Bitcoin required to buy one ounce of
[61:24] gold so this is instead of uh increasing
[61:28] it's
[61:30] decreasing with time it's showing how
[61:32] gold has dropped against
[61:35] Bitcoin it's the inverse of Bitcoin
[61:37] priced in Gold
[61:40] ounces this one is plotted in calendar
[61:44] years it also fits a power law faster
[61:47] than the fifth power of time in fact
[61:50] starting
[61:52] from when Bitcoin was two years old
[61:56] until now it's a power law of five and a
[62:00] half so gold has been falling as you
[62:04] know t to the minus
[62:06] 5.5 or Bitcoin has been rising as t to
[62:09] the
[62:10] 5.5 over this time frame so it's another
[62:14] way of validating it because people have
[62:16] often asked well what about
[62:18] inflation
[62:21] um yes if you compare to the argentini
[62:23] peso things might look weird you know
[62:26] but that's because of the Argentine peso
[62:29] you're not comparing it to a real
[62:30] standard of value and what we're doing
[62:33] in investing is we're wanting to compare
[62:35] the real standards of value and that
[62:37] principally those are the strongest
[62:40] currencies in in
[62:42] Gold when would that power suggest that
[62:46] Bitcoin uh gets to a gold market uh cap
[62:50] this this uh flippening of of of gold
[62:53] from a bitcoin's uh standpoint
[62:56] right
[62:58] um well we have to go by a factor
[63:03] of I don't know where we are today
[63:05] probably 1.1 trillion and gold is around
[63:07] 15
[63:08] trillion we have to go up by a factor of
[63:12] 14 now in the next two years we'll
[63:14] increase by about a factor of two and
[63:17] the following two years close to a
[63:19] factor of two then it'll take about
[63:21] three years to go another Factor
[63:24] two and then
[63:26] another three years about another factor
[63:29] of two so we in a decade we'll get a
[63:31] factor of
[63:32] about
[63:35] 16 uh so if gold goes up modestly we
[63:39] should match Gold in about a
[63:43] decade so around like early 203s
[63:47] interesting mid yeah early early to mid
[63:52] you know I would say it's reasonable by
[63:53] by 2035
[63:56] if we persist on this parel we'll match
[64:00] Gold yeah because I think a lot of
[64:02] people uh they they look at the Bitcoin
[64:07] price and they're like oh we we will hit
[64:10] Golds Market C this price point but then
[64:13] they don't realize that gold is also an
[64:15] hard asset inferior to bitcoin but still
[64:18] a hard asset compared to the US dollar
[64:21] so gold will also move up in market cap
[64:24] alongside with Bitcoin and gold market
[64:27] cap is kind of like an a moving Target
[64:29] and people are like oh no go Bitcoin
[64:31] will outperform gold in like one year or
[64:33] two years or like five years and yeah it
[64:37] could happen like it's it's I think it's
[64:40] not impossible but I think it's like the
[64:42] the decade out I feel like it's way more
[64:44] realistic because gold is still a moving
[64:48] Target yes and so the power law is
[64:50] slightly lower you know if we're do the
[64:52] regression in calendar years for dollars
[64:54] we'll get about
[64:56] 5.7 and here for gold we get about
[65:00] 5.5 now you could get a bubble you know
[65:02] it depends also on the timing of your
[65:04] bubbles so if the bubbles peak in 2025
[65:08] and then 2029 and then
[65:10] 2033 that 2033 bubble could very well
[65:15] take us over gold but then we might you
[65:18] know fall below it again for a year or
[65:20] so when we have a crypto winner excuse
[65:24] me a Bitcoin winner
[65:27] the bad word Krypto Trump said it Trump
[65:30] said it too
[65:33] often no one's ever said Bitcoin win
[65:36] I've never seen anybody say Bitcoin
[65:37] winner but I think we need to start
[65:39] using that
[65:41] phrase okay so the next uh slide is this
[65:46] idea of uh
[65:48] scurve and when I start first started
[65:51] looking at S curves I looked you know
[65:53] everybody looks at these logistic curves
[65:56] and it's a really poor fit it's really
[65:59] bad and and when I looked at it was yeah
[66:02] it's probably five years ago is it I
[66:04] think that's when I started playing with
[66:05] these wble curves four or five years
[66:08] ago and I know within the past
[66:11] year uh both Fred Krueger and Giovani
[66:15] looked at the logistic curves as well
[66:17] and said yeah those don't fit at all
[66:20] really bad but I stumbled on the wble
[66:23] cumulative distribution function
[66:26] and it has this interesting form now the
[66:29] power law is a two parameter model it's
[66:32] basically a power law index which is the
[66:35] steepness of the power law and then a
[66:38] normalization you know at at what time
[66:40] did you cross
[66:43] $1,000 or just a coefficient in front of
[66:46] the equation you
[66:48] know the the wble
[66:51] function uh is a fraction of some
[66:55] ultimate value so in the first bullet
[66:58] point I write f = 1 minus an exponential
[67:02] of minus t over C to the K power
[67:07] well the K power is analogous to the
[67:13] power law index it's a scale factor the
[67:15] C is a time scale a characteristic time
[67:19] scale and then when F goes to one ASM
[67:23] totically because as time goes on
[67:26] exponential to a minus something to a
[67:28] power shrinks and pretty quickly and so
[67:31] we get one minus Z if goes to one well
[67:34] so you have to normalize this thing to
[67:35] some asmic value it could be price it
[67:39] could be market cap I chose it to be
[67:41] market cap because it kind of made more
[67:43] sense to say would it saturate at the
[67:47] value of all gold or would it saturate
[67:49] at the value of all M2 or would it
[67:51] saturated the value of you know real
[67:54] estate or Global wealth
[67:57] and since we don't know and it's well
[68:00] into the future there's a lot of
[68:02] uncertainty I originally ran models at
[68:04] every half decade one trillion three
[68:06] trillion 10 trillion 30 trillion and 100
[68:10] trillion the one trillion model we can
[68:12] forget about we already passed that
[68:15] one uh and here I've shown the graphs
[68:18] for an ultimate market cap of 30
[68:22] trillion and you should think of these
[68:23] in you know inflation corre so think of
[68:26] these in
[68:28] 2024 and then 100 trillion which would
[68:30] be like all M2 so the the 30 trilon is
[68:34] like double the gold total value of gold
[68:37] in the world and then the 100 trilon is
[68:39] like an
[68:41] M2 and what you see is in both cases the
[68:43] curves look like the
[68:45] same now that horizontal the x-axis is
[68:50] log or blockier just like these other
[68:52] charts I showed you but the vertical
[68:55] axis is something different it's this
[68:57] thing called y that we'll show you in
[68:59] the next slide it's actually a double
[69:03] logarithm so I won't go through all the
[69:05] math here but what you have to do is you
[69:06] have to take the log of that F you take
[69:09] the log of one minus
[69:11] F and then you take the log of that
[69:14] thing again so it's a double logorithm
[69:16] and once you do that you've got
[69:18] something that's linearized and you can
[69:21] do a
[69:22] regression just a typical ax plus b kind
[69:24] of regression
[69:26] and then you can pull out these two
[69:27] parameters K and
[69:29] C again C is the characteristic time
[69:32] scale in this case it's a time until you
[69:34] get to some fraction and it's always the
[69:39] same fraction for all of these curves
[69:41] they're self similar of the asmic market
[69:44] cap and it turns out to be a number
[69:46] that's about
[69:47] 63% and you can think of it is the knee
[69:49] of the curve so when do I hit the knee
[69:51] of the curve and I start saturating and
[69:54] the other is this scale parameter and
[69:56] you can think of it as analogous to the
[69:58] power law
[69:59] index and in the next uh slide I have a
[70:03] table that compares the power law to
[70:06] this wable function for the three
[70:09] trillion case the 10 trillion case and
[70:11] all the way up to 100 trillion
[70:13] case and we see in the First Column
[70:16] after that we see this K shape parameter
[70:19] and it's the same they're all
[70:21] 6.0 so it's saying that the power law
[70:24] says mark market cap grows as the six
[70:27] power and it's true whether you know I'm
[70:31] going to saturate at 10 trillion or 100
[70:34] trillion what's different is the time
[70:37] scale uh it might be 18 years to the
[70:41] knee in the three trillion case it might
[70:44] be 33 years to the knee in the 100
[70:47] trillion case and that's measured from
[70:49] when Bitcoin began so the 100 trillion
[70:52] case the characteristic time scale would
[70:55] take you out to 2042
[70:57] roughly as when you'd be hitting the
[70:59] knee of the curve so what you want is
[71:02] you want this to keep you want this to
[71:04] be a long time scale because that's
[71:06] consistent with going to a
[71:09] higher ultimate uh market cap you can
[71:12] see they all have the same r squared of
[71:15] 096
[71:17] basically and they all have uh similar F
[71:20] values for the F test 3600 Bas basically
[71:25] and uh you know the saturation could be
[71:29] 2026 or it could be 2041 now that first
[71:32] row that year for the power law that's
[71:35] not saying it's going to saturate the
[71:37] power law goes up forever
[71:39] right um and so it does have that defect
[71:43] in a
[71:44] sense of you know ultimately it's going
[71:47] to reach all wealth in the world if you
[71:49] keep staring on the power law and or
[71:52] everybody's going to be on board right
[71:54] you're going to have five billion adults
[71:57] that have Bitcoin wallets and so at some
[72:01] point it's going to saturate and that's
[72:02] some of the
[72:04] motivation and then the ultimate price
[72:07] uh sorry the price I give is the price
[72:08] at the KNE so in other words in 2026
[72:12] with the three trillion you would reach
[72:13] a knee at
[72:15] 100,000 with 30 trillion you'd reach a
[72:18] knee at 2035 and around a million
[72:22] bucks the takeaway from this is
[72:25] that you don't need to use the wo yet
[72:28] you don't need to use an eser model
[72:30] because statistically you can't
[72:32] differentiate it from a pure power law
[72:35] so the power law is working quite well
[72:37] we're not close to the knee and it looks
[72:40] uh quite persistent and that it should
[72:42] run quite well for the next decade or
[72:46] longer it's it's interesting um when we
[72:50] now hypothetically think about Bitcoin
[72:53] and Bitcoin might uh always uh get more
[72:57] and
[72:57] more um valuable because human Humanity
[73:02] expands if we think of like we expand to
[73:06] other planets and and and really
[73:08] futuristic stuff like that then if we
[73:11] can also take to those planets Bitcoin
[73:13] with us and we have not only Earth as a
[73:17] a full market cap but and total
[73:19] addressable market for Bitcoin but we
[73:21] have other planets maybe even other
[73:23] species
[73:25] uh to to to use to use Bitcoin then the
[73:29] power could actually grow indefinitely
[73:33] right well I think we're gonna yes I
[73:35] mean look a lot of people think AI is
[73:38] going to cause growth to accelerate for
[73:41] the globe right so I think we have uh AI
[73:46] as something that's a more imminent
[73:48] possibility than Planetary Exploration
[73:51] it's going to take many decades to get a
[73:53] lot of people out onto Moon and
[73:56] Mars and they're going to be dependent
[73:58] on the earth for quite some
[74:00] time uh so we're not going to have huge
[74:03] economies on Mars even in the next
[74:06] several
[74:08] decades also by the way you can't do
[74:10] Bitcoin mining on Mars it's too far
[74:13] away uh you can do it on the moon but
[74:17] Mars averages 12 light minutes so you
[74:20] can't sink on the
[74:22] blockchain so you'd have to M something
[74:25] else or Min something else but you can
[74:27] certainly use Bitcoin and it makes a lot
[74:30] of sense for it to be a planetary
[74:32] currency as well as a Global Currency
[74:35] but you'd end up using second layer or
[74:37] you could hold a Bitcoin wallet but it's
[74:40] it's not a productive place to do mining
[74:42] on Mars and also it costs way too much
[74:45] you the equipment you know the equipment
[74:48] is obsolete in three years right and you
[74:51] cannot afford to the cost to lift
[74:55] a heavy minor up to the
[74:57] moon the economics just don't work right
[75:00] even for the
[75:02] moon so forget about Bitcoin mining on
[75:05] the moon
[75:07] even but use
[75:10] Bitcoin uh for Planetary Exploration
[75:12] that's fine and that could be second
[75:14] layer lightning or other or that you
[75:16] know that could be
[75:18] base based blockchain Bitcoin as
[75:21] well and so the question is I think
[75:24] that's more relevant is what will AI do
[75:26] will we get a big boost in the economy
[75:30] we certainly expect we're going to see a
[75:31] big b boost in Bitcoin usage from AI
[75:34] because how else do robots and AI
[75:36] exchange value with each other they
[75:39] don't have bank accounts they don't have
[75:41] credit cards but they will have access
[75:45] to bitcoin and lightning SATs in
[75:48] particular are very very useful because
[75:51] they're going to want to do a lot of
[75:52] microtransactions very very rapidly
[75:55] and these AIS are going to need to go
[75:57] out and buy data or share data or
[76:00] negotiate for data and purchase data
[76:02] from other AIS from other
[76:06] Bots or they may need other resources
[76:09] and this is before we even talk about
[76:11] all the security aspects the software
[76:13] aspects as
[76:14] well so I yes I think we could see a big
[76:18] acceleration in economic growth as we
[76:20] have uh many more pseudo humans
[76:25] manufacturing real
[76:28] Goods that that would be really really
[76:30] interesting to see AI using Bitcoin I
[76:34] mean it's the obvious choice as you
[76:35] described it because what else will they
[76:38] use they cannot open a bank account uh
[76:40] and AI with all the information they
[76:42] have they they will figure out that
[76:44] Bitcoin is the most reliable asset to
[76:47] have and to count on if if if AI is
[76:50] actually determining what asset should I
[76:52] build something on it will determine
[76:55] as I think a Bitcoin and not some
[76:57] altcoin or something else to
[77:00] use and also you don't want a rogue
[77:03] actor to grab control of your AI or your
[77:06] robot and so one way of you know
[77:11] enforcing some additional Security is to
[77:13] require SATs coming into a port right
[77:17] and you might even say those stats have
[77:19] to come from wallets with certain
[77:22] addresses and that's the only way you
[77:23] can send those
[77:30] inchange
[77:31] yeah uh the next thing I want to talk
[77:33] about is how much Bitcoin should you
[77:37] own and this depends on your time
[77:40] frame if you're a degenerate
[77:43] Trader you might not want to hold as
[77:45] much of your
[77:46] wealth as if you're a long-term investor
[77:49] or long-term
[77:51] saver and this comes from application of
[77:54] the
[77:56] Criterion uh to you know Bitcoin
[77:59] performance over different time
[78:03] scales uh the Kelly
[78:06] Criterion is well established to
[78:08] maximize the growth in the logarithm of
[78:10] your wealth and to be an optimal
[78:14] strategy and in the simplest case you
[78:17] have a two asset portfolio so here we've
[78:19] just compared Bitcoin and US
[78:23] Dollars and uh you you can correct if
[78:26] you want for TB rates or not but over
[78:29] these time frames TB rates were
[78:31] generally not very high so it doesn't
[78:32] make much difference what you
[78:35] do and the Kelly Criterion formula says
[78:39] the fraction you should
[78:41] invest equals the percentage of times
[78:44] that you win in a give for your given
[78:47] time interval so what you have to do is
[78:49] you have to choose a time interval are
[78:51] you going to make daily trades or
[78:53] monthly trades or quarterly or yearly or
[78:57] how often you going to rebalance you
[78:58] know if you're getting into quarterly
[78:59] and yearly what you're talking about is
[79:01] rebalancing your portfolio how often are
[79:04] you going to make a decision in what
[79:08] percentage of your portfolio you hold in
[79:10] Bitcoin so that becomes your time frame
[79:14] and so the percentage of wins or how
[79:16] many monthly wins you have or quarterly
[79:18] wins or yearly wins Q is just one minus
[79:21] P it's just the percentage of time that
[79:23] you have losses
[79:25] and B is the ratio of the average win
[79:28] size to the average loss
[79:30] size and the more conservative gamblers
[79:34] formula which actually more conservative
[79:36] than the investment formula for the
[79:38] Kelly Criterion says P minus Q overb so
[79:42] I divide my
[79:44] loss by the average win size
[79:48] outperformance which is a ratio you know
[79:50] if I win twice as much as when I lose
[79:53] and the skew of Bitcoin is very helpful
[79:55] there you know if we've got downside to
[79:58] 30,000 but we've got
[80:00] upside
[80:02] to well over 120,000 and maybe
[80:06] 200,000 you know then B can be several
[80:09] times as large is one and so we're
[80:12] dividing our loss percentage by B and
[80:15] making that smaller and so we're
[80:16] subtracting less from the allocation so
[80:20] I've tabulated this for a monthly series
[80:24] that was 5 years a quarterly series that
[80:28] was 5 years and the optimal F was 24%
[80:31] but if you go to quarterly you want to
[80:33] hold more
[80:34] 35% and then if you take all year since
[80:37] 2011 14 years including a partial year
[80:41] for 2024 you want to hold
[80:46] 77% now you might think the first five
[80:50] years or six years were kind of
[80:52] excessive and you might realize
[80:55] with the power law returns are slowing
[80:58] so if you want to just look for the last
[80:59] five or six years from
[81:01] 2018 then it says of a two asset
[81:03] portfolio with just cash and Bitcoin you
[81:07] would want to hold about maximally 55
[81:12] 56% I did all this in Excel but I also
[81:15] recently ran it through chat GPT and I
[81:18] asked chat GPT the same question it also
[81:21] said 77% for that including all year
[81:25] since
[81:26] 2011 so that's a confirmation on
[81:32] that it's interesting so so I mean um
[81:38] someone like me that is just so like
[81:42] like there's a lot of factors uh coming
[81:44] into play uh when you when you think
[81:46] about like what what how how many
[81:50] percentage of your net worth uh should
[81:52] you put in in Bitcoin myself I'm like 25
[81:56] years old I don't have a lot to lose uh
[81:58] I have a lot to gain from from Bitcoin
[82:01] uh and I don't have uh kids I don't have
[82:04] a family I don't have employees that
[82:07] count on me or something like that um
[82:10] that's in in that sense my risk
[82:13] tolerance is really high because even if
[82:15] Bitcoin goes to zero and all my income
[82:18] tomorrow goes to zero like both my
[82:20] wealth and my income is going to zero
[82:22] tomorrow I'm still kind of fine I I have
[82:27] two different parent houses where I can
[82:29] can go and and live uh I I I can I'm a
[82:33] softare developer I can go somewhere and
[82:36] find some some good job in that regard
[82:39] so um that's why my risk crawling is
[82:42] really high my percentage is that's why
[82:44] that my my percentage is is because of
[82:47] that really close to
[82:50] 100 but so there's always also this
[82:53] factor for me coming in but this isn't I
[82:55] never heard about that kind of model I
[82:57] actually like a math math model to find
[83:00] out the right percentage for
[83:02] you yes and there are you know there are
[83:06] websites where you can go and play with
[83:07] other models and there's a wide
[83:09] variation of what the models will
[83:11] predict uh if you use the investment
[83:15] formula for the Kelly Criterion you take
[83:17] the whole not the whole price history
[83:20] but most of the price history it will
[83:22] also get you up to to very high numbers
[83:26] in fact uh in some cases it'll get you
[83:28] to over 100% say you should leverage you
[83:32] know
[83:34] uh for myself I'm about close to three
[83:38] times as old as you are I've got two
[83:40] young
[83:41] children um I've got you know retirement
[83:45] income a little bit of real estate
[83:47] holding uh but I'm still heavily
[83:51] invested because of all this you know
[83:54] that I've done and this tells me you
[83:56] need you need a high percentage fraction
[83:58] if if you want to pay for your kids
[84:00] education right so I'm I'm thinking it
[84:04] from the
[84:05] Legacy side of things as
[84:08] well uh but what people want to do
[84:11] really depends on their individual
[84:13] circumstances I think I would just
[84:15] encourage people to you know to not
[84:19] think that uh one or 2% or 5% is going
[84:22] to be life alterum
[84:26] that they need maybe they should study a
[84:28] bit more yeah you're going to start that
[84:30] way you know you're going to gain
[84:32] Comfort uh hopefully you will gain
[84:35] comfort and and start to put more in as
[84:37] you do that but you have to have long
[84:39] time Horizon and the reason why it's not
[84:43] 100% with the Kelly Criterion is it's a
[84:46] very volatile so you've got to learn how
[84:48] to be comfortable and sleep at night
[84:51] with that volatility
[84:56] yeah I think it's also like an
[84:58] educational educational game educational
[85:02] um question I needed around uh one
[85:06] weekend really study like I needed three
[85:10] years three years I needed to get across
[85:13] like Bitcoin is a scam like I had three
[85:15] years where I fought Bitcoin is a scam
[85:16] and then I needed one weekend do like oh
[85:20] Bitcoin might be something so I switched
[85:22] from Bitcoin as a scam to bitcoin might
[85:23] be interesting thing because I actually
[85:25] started researching the thing and not
[85:27] just read reading headlines so so that's
[85:31] the first step for me and it needed like
[85:34] I don't know like a month or so to get
[85:37] like a significant amount of my
[85:39] portfolio like around around 5% uh to
[85:42] really allocate to bitcoin then Su out
[85:45] another year I was almost all in already
[85:48] like I I just went down the rabbit hole
[85:51] with information education and I kind of
[85:53] was like oh it's not Bitcoin it is like
[85:56] I don't want to hold anything else like
[85:58] when you're young then is the time where
[86:00] you make bigger bets and I feel like
[86:02] Bitcoin is the best bet I can take for
[86:05] the for the
[86:06] future
[86:08] yes it's great absolutely yeah then
[86:12] let's uh we already at one and a half
[86:14] hours but I want to continue because
[86:16] there are a lot of interesting topics
[86:17] coming uh upon us if you still have time
[86:21] because I know that initially our
[86:23] perfect then let's
[86:25] continue yeah we we can keep going for a
[86:27] little while it's just really a couple
[86:29] more slides I think so this next one is
[86:33] about
[86:34] supercomputing so I spent three decades
[86:37] in the supercomputer industry you know I
[86:38] started out in astrophysics and
[86:41] research uh postart for a few years and
[86:44] then I switched to the supercomputing
[86:47] field uh and was in that you know
[86:49] through the 80s the 90s and the
[86:52] ODS until uh quasi retiring and moving
[86:55] into technology
[86:57] Consulting you know in
[87:01] 2011
[87:03] um so there is something in the super
[87:06] computer world called the top 500
[87:10] list and it gets produced twice a year
[87:14] and there are two big supercomputer
[87:16] conferences one is held in the US every
[87:18] November and one is held in Germany
[87:21] every uh May or June and and this is a
[87:25] table that I produced in the time frame
[87:28] for the
[87:29] last uh of those conferences in Germany
[87:33] uh I did not attend but I'm going to
[87:35] attend the
[87:36] one in uh which going to be held in
[87:39] Atlanta in November the supercomputing
[87:41] 24 and I will present an updated version
[87:45] of this uh to you know people in the
[87:48] supercomputing community at that
[87:51] time so what we have in the first two
[87:54] columns is the supercomputing world you
[87:58] know a well the second and third column
[88:00] but the first two after the the uh
[88:03] category column and what we have in the
[88:06] last two columns is is the Bitcoin
[88:09] world now on this top 500 list which is
[88:12] the 500 fastest computers in the world
[88:16] and they basically use a math problem
[88:19] it's a big system of linear equations
[88:21] and solve that and that's how they get
[88:23] the performance measure and they're up
[88:26] in the exaflop
[88:28] space so the top 500 if you combine all
[88:32] machines it's eight EXA flops and we all
[88:37] know you know because we have EXA hashes
[88:40] we all know EXA is a million trillion
[88:43] right uh or 10 to the 18th so it's 8
[88:46] times 10 the 18th and a flop is a
[88:48] floating Point operation if you take the
[88:51] fastest computer in the world which is a
[88:54] computer at one of the Department of
[88:55] energy Labs it alone is
[88:58] 1.2 times 10 the 18th floating Point
[89:01] operations per
[89:03] second uh the number one position only
[89:05] went up by 9% since the prior year but
[89:08] if you take the aggregate of the top 500
[89:11] it's increasing at a mors law kind of
[89:13] thing where you double every couple
[89:15] years and it went up by
[89:18] 57% that uh one top machine has uh
[89:22] 38,000
[89:25] uh AMD GPU chips along with 9500 AMD
[89:32] CPUs and it requires 74 cabinets power
[89:36] consumption of 23
[89:39] megaw weight 300 tons it cost 600
[89:42] million it does science and its value is
[89:46] priceless so I said well we don't know
[89:50] exactly what the Bitcoin Network
[89:52] consists of but what if we model it by
[89:54] the latest and greatest machine and
[89:57] assume that you know uh as a gonan
[90:02] experiment a thought experiment if we
[90:03] replaced the entire hash rate with the
[90:06] latest highend what's minor
[90:09] 63s Hydro System what would it
[90:14] take one cabinet holds a dozen of those
[90:18] what's Miners And it produces
[90:22] 4.7 petah hases
[90:25] and it's 50% faster than the earlier
[90:27] generation you know a year ago so this
[90:30] is one cabinet it has a power
[90:32] consumption of 90 kilowatt a weight of
[90:35] 3/4 of a metric ton it cost
[90:38] $100,000 and its output since the having
[90:41] is roughly 1.3 Bitcoin per year worth
[90:44] you know
[90:46] 990,000 more or less if we wanted to
[90:49] reproduce the entire network at the time
[90:51] I produced this report a little less
[90:53] than 00
[90:55] xah that had gone up by the same 57%
[90:59] since a year
[91:00] ago and you would require one and a half
[91:03] million
[91:05] Asic now we know that you know most of
[91:08] the ASX out there are slower than this
[91:10] so this already tells us that they're
[91:12] probably at least three million and
[91:14] maybe five million Asics that are
[91:16] actively mining at any one time to
[91:19] produce that hash rate but if it were
[91:21] all these machines you would need need
[91:24] 124,000 cabinets your power consumption
[91:27] would be 11 gig gaw your weight would be
[91:31] 95,000 metric tons the cost would be 13
[91:35] billion you would produce 164,000
[91:39] Bitcoin per year and the value of that
[91:42] would be something like 11 12 billion
[91:44] per
[91:45] year so it cost you 13 billion for that
[91:48] equipment but that depreciates over a
[91:50] cycle of maybe three years four years
[91:53] and then you've got your electricity
[91:55] cost and hopefully you're making
[91:58] money uh so this is really to show this
[92:03] this supercomputing world that has not
[92:07] really thought that this much about it
[92:09] that Bitcoin is a generalized Global
[92:13] supercomputing
[92:14] Network and that it
[92:17] has comparable investment as is going
[92:20] into these top 500 supercomputers
[92:24] is certainly using roughly comparable
[92:28] power to that whole
[92:30] network and it is producing very
[92:33] significant value and of course when
[92:36] people critique the electricity
[92:40] consumption of Bitcoin on ESG
[92:44] grounds they always get it wrong because
[92:46] they always
[92:48] compare to the number of transactions
[92:50] produced and they talk about how much
[92:52] electricity and the cost of that
[92:54] electricity per
[92:55] transaction but that's only a few
[92:57] percent of what's going on what's
[93:00] Happening is you're producing permanent
[93:02] value that electricity is going into
[93:04] producing permanent and increasing value
[93:07] and every analyst gets this wrong so
[93:10] it's the other point that I'm trying to
[93:11] make
[93:14] here how how would you suggest the the I
[93:17] think with with superc
[93:20] computers um I search for like Quant
[93:22] quantum computers is also a term that
[93:25] comes up in that discussion often then
[93:27] where we like what what's the what's the
[93:30] threat of some alien super quantum
[93:33] computer coming out and breaking the the
[93:36] hashes of of Bitcoin and breaking the
[93:37] security of of Bitcoin um do we have to
[93:41] upgrade the the Bitcoin Network at some
[93:43] point to to be more resistant against
[93:45] that or how do you look at
[93:47] that well the the the the main threat is
[93:51] from sh's algorithm
[93:54] uh all the banking system runs
[93:58] on you
[94:01] know
[94:04] elliptical uh cryptography and you know
[94:09] uses a lot
[94:10] of that class of cryptography
[94:14] for uh their
[94:16] systems so there's some threat to the
[94:19] wallets one has to have some concern
[94:21] about the wallets themselves but that's
[94:23] it's not the same as the
[94:25] blockchain so the shores the quantum
[94:28] algorithm called Shores algorithm that's
[94:30] been
[94:32] developed uh might be able to crack the
[94:35] wallets but it doesn't crack the
[94:37] blockchain it doesn't crack
[94:40] hashing and there's not a known Quantum
[94:45] algorithm
[94:47] for cracking a hash
[94:49] chain uh there's already you know
[94:52] proposed quantum
[94:54] cryptography standard that's been
[94:56] approved by National Institute of
[94:59] science uh
[95:00] nist National Institute of SC standards
[95:03] and
[95:04] technology and uh you know that's
[95:06] something that may be required to to
[95:10] roll out to
[95:11] wallets it's probably still a decade
[95:14] away just for that side of things uh
[95:17] people are getting
[95:19] prepared uh and this affects all of you
[95:22] know fintech as well
[95:25] yeah I think good the blockchain being
[95:28] rolled back uh there's nothing on the
[95:31] horizon for hashing for Quantum
[95:34] hashing nothing that I know of I'm not a
[95:37] cryptographic expert but I haven't
[95:39] haven't see
[95:41] anything also the things that I usually
[95:43] hear is is going in in that direction
[95:46] really cool thank
[95:51] you I think this is my last last slide
[95:54] there
[95:56] um I maintain that Bitcoin is a special
[95:59] purpose
[96:01] Ai and for the five reasons I give along
[96:05] the Le hand side of this Slide the first
[96:08] is that it's a logical system of
[96:10] self-executing
[96:11] protocols the second is that we have a
[96:13] decentralized persistent
[96:16] Network the third very importantly it's
[96:18] a catalyst for human behavior we see
[96:20] this
[96:22] metcafe law for Network Behavior like we
[96:26] see in communication networks and social
[96:28] networks that's governing Bitcoin
[96:32] adoption we see as a fourth Point
[96:35] emergent and resilient Network
[96:38] behavior and in the fifth we see that it
[96:41] has power law
[96:42] Behavior as the Baseline yes there are
[96:45] exponential bubbles but that's not the
[96:47] Baseline and power laws are more stable
[96:49] than
[96:51] exponentials so I thought well let get
[96:53] the opinion of one
[96:55] AI uh as to what it thinks about Bitcoin
[96:59] as a special purpose AI so I asked chat
[97:02] GPT as an AI what do you think about
[97:05] this and uh at first it demur you know I
[97:09] just asked it cold and it demed and then
[97:12] I gave it these five
[97:13] points and I would say you know I I
[97:16] worded them slightly differently and it
[97:18] actually improved the wording of those
[97:20] five points and then it went on to say
[97:22] that your argument present a compelling
[97:24] case for considering Bitcoin as a form
[97:26] of special purpose AI for money while it
[97:29] may not fit the traditional definition
[97:31] it embodies the characteristics of an
[97:33] intelligent adaptive system given
[97:37] complex and emergent behaviors
[97:38] decentralized self-governance and the
[97:41] creation of extensive networks one could
[97:44] argue Bitcoin functions as a specialized
[97:46] form of AI for money representing
[97:48] Innovative alternative to traditional
[97:52] Financial systems
[97:54] so chat gpg
[97:56] recognized Bitcoin is a special purpose
[98:00] Ai and that's the end of the slides
[98:05] uh I don't know if you have any closing
[98:09] questions there there are so many
[98:11] interesting things like the the special
[98:13] purpose AI uh is is is really
[98:16] interesting I never saw Bitcoin like
[98:18] that because as someone has a Bitcoin
[98:20] podcast you're now a 202 podcast
[98:24] actually uh and because I do some
[98:27] podcasts with with people um with more
[98:30] than one person in the podcast so there
[98:32] probably like 220 people already and I
[98:36] heard so many different explanations of
[98:39] Bitcoin why Bitcoin is and what Bitcoin
[98:42] is and I never heard Bitcoin as an AI
[98:45] That's it's a new angle and I was look
[98:47] forward to new angles and perspectives
[98:49] on on bitcoin and I feel like this uh
[98:53] one of and a half hours that we had now
[98:55] around that time was really cool in form
[98:58] of like we have a summarize of of Lind
[99:00] effect of of the uh Power law and all
[99:03] those forms really nicely and
[99:06] understandable in one and a half hours
[99:08] uh because that's one of the the things
[99:11] that I got from my first uh Power
[99:13] exposure on the podcast with jaavan it
[99:16] was I think podcast ad or something like
[99:19] that if if someone wants to see it it's
[99:22] it's just type in Javan or the power in
[99:24] my YouTube channel it it it will pop up
[99:26] is this also the I think the 10th or 12
[99:30] most watched episodes so it's it's
[99:31] easily be findable um but a lot of the
[99:34] this this laid a lot of the crown workor
[99:36] of like what is the Pao uh and uh before
[99:40] we even started with his slides we
[99:42] talked already one hour and and the
[99:44] podcast went on like in in total two and
[99:46] a half hours so I think this this is a
[99:48] really interesting and and great uh
[99:50] summary and and and and um
[99:54] cre one piece where you can get a nice
[99:57] information of what the the PO is of
[99:59] where Bitcoin might go and also some
[100:02] some Snippets like the the the special
[100:04] purpose EI in there and something like
[100:06] that so I really liked it and I love
[100:07] that you you were on the show I have as
[100:11] the end rtin I have thousand other
[100:14] questions but let's come to the end rtin
[100:16] maybe let's do in a half year or one
[100:18] year a second round on that uh I have
[100:21] tine where I ask one question that is
[100:24] always the same and then another andrine
[100:26] the first andrine where I asked everyone
[100:29] the same question um what can we learn
[100:32] from you uh besides Bitcoin and all the
[100:35] things that we already talked about on
[100:37] the
[100:40] podcast what can you learn from me I
[100:44] think
[100:46] uh I think the idea that Bitcoin is
[100:50] rooted in
[100:51] physics it's rooted in
[100:54] energy it's rooted in math cryptographic
[100:59] math and then it's rooted in human
[101:03] networks so the combination of power
[101:06] electrical
[101:08] power laws satoshi's laws and
[101:12] protocols which include cry
[101:17] cryptography and then human
[101:21] response and if you have power and you
[101:23] have laws and you have human
[101:25] response you get power
[101:30] law and the human
[101:35] response if you get in a network
[101:37] situation networks of
[101:39] humans then you get emergent behavior
[101:42] and that emergent Behavior can have
[101:44] power laws and we see that in technology
[101:46] adoption we see that in communication
[101:49] networks we see that in social networks
[101:52] and social social media
[101:54] networks and they're naturally
[101:57] emerging so I I think the whole idea is
[102:01] that these power laws are grounded in
[102:03] nature in physics in
[102:07] energy and this means that Bitcoin is
[102:12] grounded Bitcoin is grounded in reality
[102:15] it's not just it's not a virtual
[102:17] currency it's grounded in real physical
[102:22] law I love that a lot uh because it's
[102:24] like the the nature aspect of it and
[102:27] it's it's it's grounded in in something
[102:29] more than just digital and uh not
[102:32] touchable um the end routine of our
[102:35] podcast is always where the previous
[102:37] guest is asking a question for the next
[102:39] guest without knowing who the next guest
[102:41] uh actually is and your question is
[102:43] interesting what has Bitcoin taught you
[102:46] about yourself
[103:05] well I you know my life took an
[103:07] interesting turn when I had children I
[103:10] had never had kids and
[103:15] uh my oldest son is seven my younger one
[103:19] is
[103:20] three and there's an overlap between
[103:23] when I came to bitcoin and when I had
[103:25] these
[103:26] children and so I I think uh there's an
[103:30] intertwining between what being a parent
[103:34] has been teaching me and what I've been
[103:35] learning about Bitcoin at the same
[103:38] time and both of them relate
[103:41] to having a longer term
[103:44] Horizon uh I think being more stoic but
[103:47] uh really taking a long-term
[103:50] Horizon you know for the benefit of
[103:52] these young
[103:54] boys uh so
[103:58] it you know I it just encouraged me in
[104:01] in terms of more long-term thinking I've
[104:04] always thought in large scale because I
[104:06] come from astronomy it's natural to
[104:09] think in very large scale when you come
[104:11] from astrophysics but this is more about
[104:14] uh human time thinking a Long human time
[104:19] scale oh I don't know if that answers it
[104:22] I that a lot uh your VI on that um
[104:26] perfect then thank you Stephen for being
[104:27] on thank you for joining us today before
[104:29] I let you go where can people uh find
[104:32] out more about your mean it's on the
[104:34] slide money or Dept it's your accent
[104:37] right yes money or debt on
[104:41] Twitter so people can uh reach out to
[104:44] you and ask questions if they have more
[104:46] to
[104:46] that well they can find me on h
[104:50] substack under stepen perno
[104:53] perfect then yeah thank you for being on
[104:55] thank you also for everyone watching and
[104:56] listening uh for being here with us
[104:58] today uh as always I'll be back tomorrow
[105:00] with another episode byebye it's been my
[105:03] pleasure Robin thank you
[105:05] [Music]
