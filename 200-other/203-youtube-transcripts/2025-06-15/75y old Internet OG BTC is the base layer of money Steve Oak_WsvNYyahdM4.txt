[00:00] will be using Bitcoin Without Really
[00:02] knowing that it's Bitcoin looking at
[00:04] Bitcoin as a base protocol then makes it
[00:08] so that I don't think we even know what
[00:11] we will see in Bitcoin M okay these
[00:14] people go here then they take profits I
[00:16] said how can you take profits when
[00:18] Bitcoin is money Bitcoin is a source of
[00:21] Truth when Bitcoin is the base money
[00:24] there will be applications that we
[00:27] haven't even thought of yet
[00:32] how old are you 72 or something like
[00:34] that 75 I just completed 75 in January
[00:38] of this last year so a that's amazing
[00:42] being 75 and living through the internet
[00:45] adoption living through so many
[00:47] adoptions actually like cell
[00:49] phone yeah when I well you know the
[00:52] microsof microprocessor was invented in
[00:55] the early
[00:56] 70s uh wasn't really mark able until
[01:01] they brought out the the the first
[01:04] microprocessor commercially was from
[01:06] Intel in
[01:09] 1971 then I was I was still in
[01:11] California at that time but I didn't
[01:14] really know much about that I was uh
[01:16] well I first started out as
[01:18] a um as a programmer well as a as a
[01:23] computer operated on a what was called a
[01:25] Linton
[01:27] microsystem I don't even think they make
[01:29] computers anymore they make microwaves
[01:31] instead but it was a
[01:35] u uh had 4K of programmable
[01:39] memory paper tape
[01:41] in paper tape out and a 35 character per
[01:45] second
[01:46] printer and so during the day a girl
[01:49] would put in the input and I would then
[01:51] come in at night and run the
[01:53] reports and so I found some tapes how to
[01:57] program the computer and I'll said wow
[01:59] this is I listened to tapes it's like it
[02:02] was talking to
[02:04] me like I was born to
[02:07] program and so I started
[02:10] wri
[02:12] 1973 this was in 1973 when I started
[02:16] that
[02:17] job and so I started programming a
[02:19] little bit and then uh we moved off of
[02:23] that computer to another computer and
[02:25] they had a contractor come in and write
[02:27] it in
[02:28] Fortran and so I learned Fortran from
[02:32] him and then later we decided to go on
[02:35] to another computer so he rewrote it in
[02:37] cobal but he just I he actually just
[02:41] gave me the the the sheets and I had to
[02:44] key them into a keyboard compile them
[02:47] you know debug the program and all that
[02:50] kind of stuff so I that's how I started
[02:52] to learn Pro uh
[02:54] cowall and then later on I decided Well
[02:57] I'm going to go see what a real real
[03:00] programmer job is like and so I went I I
[03:05] well first I thought well I'll just go
[03:07] to this
[03:08] interview so they can tell me what
[03:10] they're looking for and he hired me
[03:13] so so that kind of started my my
[03:16] Mainframe programming career uh we were
[03:19] on a IBM 360 at that time
[03:23] Mainframe how did you discover Bitcoin
[03:25] with like uh when you discover Bitcoin
[03:27] you were already like 70 or around that
[03:30] how did you discover it and I've always
[03:32] wondered how come I didn't hear about
[03:34] Bitcoin in but um earlier in my life the
[03:40] first time I really heard about it was
[03:41] my son came to me and he said hey look
[03:45] look at the these
[03:46] crypto uh currencies they're new Bitcoin
[03:50] I think he had some ethereum and that
[03:52] kind of stuff so it was after the
[03:54] 2117 when you know 216 217 when ethereum
[03:58] came out and I said well right now I was
[04:02] just I was I was then a support engineer
[04:05] for a application monitoring system
[04:09] called
[04:10] introscope and for a a major insurance
[04:14] company in the United States and so I
[04:17] was just coming up to a new release I
[04:19] just said I I I I just can't worry about
[04:22] this right now I can't study about it
[04:25] well in 2019 they threw me out of my
[04:28] work they wanted to get everybody back
[04:31] in the office and I lived 2,000 miles
[04:33] away from the nearest office so they let
[04:37] me go but at that time I was I just
[04:40] completed 708 70 years I was going to
[04:43] work until 72 or 73 and then but my uh
[04:49] you know and then that would be when my
[04:52] wife would have social
[04:54] security because she really she had a
[04:57] lot of health problems and so she needed
[04:59] good insurance so I worked and so but
[05:02] they laid me off in 2019 and one of my
[05:06] things in my life is I I constantly
[05:09] learn I want to constantly be learning
[05:12] and and striving to know something you
[05:16] know about something always so I'm
[05:18] always reading I'm always studying stuff
[05:21] and I'm I'm pretty much a self-made
[05:24] network engineer I just got the books
[05:27] and started reading them and and having
[05:30] a router or something to play with and
[05:32] just started playing with it so I went
[05:34] from programmer to network engineer and
[05:37] later my later life was at the higher
[05:40] level of of the of the internet layers
[05:44] in the application and and the
[05:47] application and the um display
[05:50] level and so um so I just basically
[05:55] worked through that and then I said well
[05:57] what am I going to do now what am I
[05:59] going to study I well I think I'm going
[06:00] to start my studying these
[06:03] cryptocurrencies so I started to study I
[06:07] started looking for stuff on
[06:09] YouTube and uh there was a guy in Chico
[06:13] California called Chico something I
[06:16] can't remember what his name was but he
[06:18] was a pretty funny guy so I like to
[06:19] listen to his
[06:20] podcast and but he was in all kinds of
[06:23] different crypto but his base was
[06:26] Bitcoin and so I had some Bitcoin I had
[06:29] some others I I like mostly utility type
[06:32] tokens I didn't I didn't ever go into
[06:35] any meme or or a lot of these things I
[06:39] I'd always kind of look at the utility
[06:40] of it like links or or dot you know um
[06:45] polka dot those kinds of things that
[06:47] give give a structure or an element to
[06:51] the to the uh to the Token you know for
[06:54] a reason for the to Stellar I like
[06:56] Stellar too that was one where they they
[06:59] one of of the first ones that that did
[07:02] um crossb payments in in the payment of
[07:07] the the uh receiver and
[07:11] so I until I read the price of tomorrow
[07:14] from Jeff B it's a that's that's a great
[07:16] one I read Jeff Boo's book I pretty much
[07:18] decided okay Bitcoin is the one and so I
[07:22] pretty much got out of most of my stuff
[07:24] but I I also got kind of cut up in the
[07:27] Celsius stuff yeah Celsius was a big one
[07:30] for a lot I feel like Celio got got many
[07:34] caught up they wanted to have they want
[07:36] to huddle and they want to get some
[07:38] income from the hodling and then s just
[07:40] came up with a nice Solutions but they
[07:42] it screwed a lot of people over um yeah
[07:46] is a great liar he's he's one of the
[07:48] best Liars I've ever
[07:50] seen and and I believed him you know
[07:53] unfortunate but I and I I end up losing
[07:56] about two-thirds of a Bitcoin didn't
[07:58] have a lot out there there but because
[08:00] I starting after retired I was also on
[08:04] fixed income so I haven't really bought
[08:07] a lot of Bitcoin but I'm I'm a little
[08:11] bit more than a whole coiner so at least
[08:13] I could I've got one coin that will be a
[08:16] big amount to feel like in the future
[08:18] yeah hopefully we'll see but you know I
[08:22] I DCA every day I I use strike to uh to
[08:27] DCA I just I I use their uh automatic
[08:30] DCA because then they dropped the
[08:32] commission after eight
[08:34] days and so i i u my sometime in
[08:41] 2021 or 2022 I decided that every day I
[08:45] would buy at least 10,000 Satoshi that's
[08:49] a really good one that's a really cool H
[08:51] Target to hit yeah and I'm always really
[08:54] curious also about um you lived through
[08:57] the internet adoption like I talk about
[08:59] it and but you actually like got like
[09:01] from 1980s 1990s then but after that
[09:05] with the dot bubble and everything like
[09:07] that um what comparisons do you see
[09:09] between the internet adoption maybe even
[09:11] like other adoptions like cell phone
[09:13] adoption uh to now the Bitcoin options
[09:16] can you draw some some some comparisons
[09:19] oh yeah well I think you know when I
[09:21] first started in in the internet I was
[09:24] working at for a uh a big department
[09:27] store in the United States called nor
[09:29] Strom I was in their what was called
[09:31] their technology and AR architecture
[09:34] group a lot of people called it the the
[09:37] games the toys and games group because
[09:39] that's what we did we looked at
[09:41] different Technologies to see how they
[09:43] would work and so my boss came to me he
[09:47] said I want you all to be able to get on
[09:49] this internet thing and know what it is
[09:52] and how it
[09:53] works and so we all got connections to
[09:57] to different things and just start
[09:59] playing around with it um
[10:02] until uh and that was even before uh
[10:06] Netscape came out with the the browser
[10:09] so this was before before
[10:12] HTTP so we were using uh you know
[10:15] different different applications similar
[10:17] to AOL but AOL was one of them that that
[10:21] that was really good in this area
[10:24] because they they had a an application
[10:28] uh based B on on the lower layers so one
[10:33] of one of the things that when you start
[10:36] thinking about Bitcoin as a
[10:38] protocol that's the main thing I think
[10:40] we have to look at is that Bitcoin is a
[10:43] protocol not just joh not it is a money
[10:47] but I I always say that it is a money
[10:49] and so you can't take
[10:51] profits I YouTube this today is they
[10:54] they talking about okay these people go
[10:56] here then they take profits I said on
[10:58] their comment how can you take profits
[11:00] when Bitcoin is money I love it so my
[11:04] profit my profit is the six the SATs
[11:07] that I bought at 16k now are worth more
[11:10] in in Fiat but that's my
[11:13] profit so but yeah the uh the the layer
[11:20] system works very well on the internet
[11:23] when you if you think about um you know
[11:27] having something like like a web page P
[11:30] that then on your computer drops down
[11:33] through the through the layers to the
[11:36] physical layer that finally sends it
[11:38] over the
[11:40] Internet uh you know because you have to
[11:43] have a physical connection to your
[11:45] computer on there the internet actually
[11:48] works on the layer three level which is
[11:51] the tcpip
[11:53] layer but there's a physical layer
[11:56] Beyond below that which is the link
[11:58] layer and the and the base layer or the
[12:00] physical layer where your computer has
[12:03] to be connected to an an Ethernet or
[12:06] something like that that ethernet would
[12:08] be your your layer two and then your
[12:11] cable is your layer one so basically the
[12:15] stuff that I'm talking to you now goes
[12:17] down through my computer finally hits
[12:20] the internet stack goes across to your
[12:23] computer and then goes back up the stack
[12:25] to this video that's on your
[12:27] computer and so looking at Bitcoin as a
[12:32] base protocol then makes it so that I
[12:36] don't think we even know what we will
[12:39] see in Bitcoin usage because right now
[12:44] we're basically working on Layer
[12:46] Two okay and if you compare that to
[12:50] that's e that's in in the in the network
[12:52] so this is basic basic level that we're
[12:56] working on and so um you know some of
[12:59] the things like the fedt and those kinds
[13:02] of things I'm starting to learn more
[13:03] about those as I you know like I said I
[13:06] I'm constantly looking for something to
[13:08] read and the other day I said H I need
[13:09] to start looking into this fent because
[13:11] that looks like it's going to use the
[13:14] lightning KO like a sorry I I get my
[13:18] Spanish coming
[13:19] out like yeah I speak Spanish uh 90% of
[13:25] the time right now so oh really cool
[13:28] English is my second Lang language right
[13:29] now oh but English is uh your first
[13:32] language like you're from America right
[13:34] yeah I I'm from the United States I was
[13:36] born in
[13:37] Utah and then lived in in Utah and Idaho
[13:41] for the first 10 years and then my
[13:43] parents moved to Washington the state of
[13:46] Washington and that's where I graduated
[13:48] from high school and did you uh look
[13:52] into like uh Bitcoin programming or
[13:55] anything like that that you'll uh do
[13:57] something maybe having fent on uh
[13:59] because you also learned the pro
[14:01] programming yeah programming was in a
[14:04] way past life now I I'm cobal and Ford
[14:07] Tran and I played around with a little
[14:09] bit of C uh Bitcoin is written in
[14:13] C++ I can read the code I can kind of
[14:17] understand it but I didn't grow up in
[14:20] the uh I grew up more in the the phase
[14:25] of programming where we're using sub
[14:27] routines in inste of
[14:30] objects and objects were always kind of
[14:33] hard for me to to to figure out what an
[14:36] object was and and that kind of thing so
[14:39] I played around a little bit with Java
[14:41] because Interscope was a Java monitor so
[14:44] I I had to learn how to at least read
[14:47] and understand Java and I played with
[14:50] python and Pearl and those kinds of
[14:52] things too but I haven't really I mean I
[14:55] haven't really done much programming
[14:57] since uh since the 80s so it was kind of
[15:02] like
[15:03] H when I I haven't you know maybe in the
[15:07] in the future I'll look at it and see
[15:09] but one of the things I'm interested in
[15:11] looking at is that fediman uses
[15:14] lightning as it as its layer lower labor
[15:17] layer so the community of of uh in the
[15:22] phetamine
[15:23] they're they're a layer above lightning
[15:27] in essence
[15:29] but I I still think that we're even
[15:31] below that I mean what when we start
[15:36] thinking uh you know when I first
[15:39] started on the internet a web page
[15:41] wasn't didn't
[15:43] exist right and all the things that we
[15:46] do on the internet now didn't even exist
[15:50] the zooms the this Riverside these
[15:53] things didn't exist because they they
[15:56] were a this is a higher lay
[15:59] on the network chain and so as time went
[16:02] on those layers
[16:05] expanded to be something that as a as a
[16:10] router and a switch guy I didn't care
[16:13] about those I just wanted to make sure
[16:15] that the packet switched and the and
[16:18] that the the routes routed and that kind
[16:20] of stuff and so the uh the part that uh
[16:27] makes it so that
[16:29] like fedit is now above lightning
[16:32] because they go down to lightning to to
[16:35] do the final distribution and down
[16:38] finally down to
[16:39] bitcoin so but I think there'll even be
[16:42] layers above that that we don't even
[16:44] know yet what it'll be like when when
[16:48] Bitcoin is is the base money there will
[16:51] be applications that we haven't even
[16:54] thought of yet of of using Bitcoin and
[16:58] people won't even know that they're
[17:00] using Bitcoin they're just using money
[17:04] okay I I love that a lot and
[17:07] you and you have seen also the the
[17:09] internet adoption and and I'm wondering
[17:11] now like you have seen how quick the
[17:14] internet adoption comes but also how how
[17:16] long it takes in the beginning to get
[17:18] some of the fundamentals going um where
[17:22] would you compare it that we are right
[17:24] now with Bitcoin like are we the 1995's
[17:27] are we already at the 2000s the Bitcoin
[17:31] adoption I don't even know if we're
[17:33] above the HTTP layer which was 19 that
[17:37] was in the early early 19 uh or 18 1980s
[17:42] late in late 1980s was when HTTP came
[17:47] out and I think we're just with
[17:51] something like fedin and that we haven't
[17:53] seen the actual
[17:55] applications that are going to be used
[17:58] Bitcoin I think AI is going to be one of
[18:00] those where we're gonna we're going to
[18:02] see a lot of the AI using Bitcoin as its
[18:09] base money system to be able to transact
[18:13] and do especially micro payments and
[18:15] that kind of stuff that you really it's
[18:18] even hard to do in dollars down to this
[18:21] level it's hard to it's hard to
[18:25] anybody but the but really
[18:29] uh using lightning and and that kind of
[18:32] thing you can send small amounts of
[18:34] SATs and it goes fairly it goes real
[18:38] quick and that's the nice part about it
[18:41] so I I don't think we're even in the 90s
[18:43] yet you know we're we're still in the
[18:46] more in the base
[18:47] protocol and so when you're talking
[18:50] about Stu doing stuff on
[18:52] chain that is something that in the
[18:56] future they're not even going to think
[18:58] about being on chain there's not going
[19:00] to be this idea of I've got stuff going
[19:03] on the chain it's it's all going to be
[19:07] you know I I I can't even tell you what
[19:09] it's going to be because I don't know
[19:10] for sure but I just know that we don't
[19:13] know yet what it's going to be like
[19:16] because when Bitcoin changes to be real
[19:20] money and becomes the base layer of all
[19:24] of
[19:26] transactions as the application grow on
[19:29] top of that we'll be using Bitcoin and
[19:33] we'll you know our our Bots and our AIS
[19:36] and those things that we are are going
[19:38] to be using in the future will'll be
[19:40] using Bitcoin Without Really knowing
[19:43] that it's Bitcoin you know without
[19:46] really worrying whether it's base chain
[19:48] and that kind of stuff so that's why you
[19:50] know layer twos and layer 3es are
[19:52] important now to to work on and to get
[19:56] them as good as they can
[19:59] uh because that's going to be the base
[20:01] you know just just like ethernet when I
[20:04] when I first my first uh network was a
[20:08] token ring what's that it was an IBM
[20:10] protocol called token ring that it was
[20:14] just different way of connecting
[20:17] computers uh and I had a I had a
[20:20] netware uh
[20:23] server which was a you know a server
[20:26] that was basically just a above the you
[20:30] know at that level it wasn't really a it
[20:32] wasn't a presentation server or anything
[20:35] like that it was all it did was serve
[20:38] packets and that kind of stuff and so
[20:42] we're still in that level of of Bitcoin
[20:46] right now Bitcoin the protocol layer is
[20:49] still being utilized kind of like it was
[20:52] when I first connected to the internet
[20:54] so amazing what made it click for you
[20:57] like I use a lot I use a lot of layer
[20:59] too I have I have uh wallets for all of
[21:02] my
[21:03] kids and all of my
[21:06] grandkids and so I use Layer Two to I
[21:11] buy on strike and then I I send them to
[21:14] them to their lightning wallet these
[21:18] wallets have recovery set in to them
[21:20] also you know they have the the the
[21:23] password I I I try to always use wallets
[21:26] that have a recovery mechanism
[21:29] so that you're you know or on some I'm
[21:31] I'm using the speed wallet right now uh
[21:35] a little bit to play around with it even
[21:37] though it's uh it's more what do you
[21:40] call them you know the they they hold
[21:43] the Bitcoin during the custodial they're
[21:46] a custodial
[21:47] wallet but uh I use them to uh uh on my
[21:53] telephone here in Ecuador I I don't have
[21:55] a real plan you know where I pay month
[21:58] ly I pay every 15 to 20
[22:03] days and so I found that I can now
[22:07] through speed through speed send a
[22:11] payment to the service provider here
[22:14] which I use is what it's called claro
[22:17] claro and that is uh I can I can send
[22:21] SATs and so I notice that my number of
[22:25] SATs have gone down
[22:28] so it's becoming cheaper for me because
[22:31] my the SATs to have my phone each month

[24:12] that's that's really interesting it it's
[24:14] in also fascinating for me when I think
[24:17] about the uh us to and internet and
[24:21] Bitcoin adoption because you said like
[24:23] you're 75 I'm 25 so you're actually
[24:26] exactly three times older than
[24:29] and and they are like 50 years in
[24:32] between so my question is now where do
[24:35] you see Bitcoin when I am 75 years old
[24:39] like in 50 years um do you have some
[24:42] some framework about it then yeah that's
[24:45] the applications that we don't know
[24:47] yet because we don't know how how
[24:51] Bitcoin will be used at that point in
[24:53] time because the uh the primary reason
[25:00] that you know the low the lower
[25:02] layers are hidden from you in the
[25:05] internet you don't see them at
[25:08] all right now you know we're using all
[25:11] the layers of the internet right now in
[25:14] this
[25:15] conversation but we don't see any of
[25:18] them and that's when the applications
[25:21] went in and I don't even think it I
[25:24] think it'll uh I think it'll be within
[25:27] 15 years maybe maybe within my lifetime
[25:29] I'm hoping do do do you think that
[25:31] Bitcoin will be the only uh money or the
[25:34] dominant money uh in your life time or
[25:36] in my lifetime H I don't think so I I
[25:39] think Fiats are going to be around for a
[25:41] little bit longer I don't have a problem
[25:43] I don't have a problem with Fiat other
[25:45] than I don't save in it Bitcoin is my
[25:48] saving technology and that's what I
[25:51] finally ended up saying is if if if um
[25:55] if I'm going to save money
[25:58] I want to save
[26:00] money I don't save it in a bank I I
[26:03] pretty much uh I have
[26:05] a I have a a fund a small fund of of
[26:10] dollars that I keep in a high savings
[26:13] account on American Express and my wife
[26:16] has an account we we rent the second
[26:18] floor above us so she has an account
[26:21] that money goes into it each month and
[26:24] so we keep that as as uh as kind of a
[26:28] backup also so if you if we need some
[26:31] some money I you know for a while
[26:34] especially like here in Ecuador
[26:36] technically it's illegal to buy and and
[26:40] sell and buy and uh you can buy and sell
[26:44] but you shouldn't use it for services or
[26:47] to buy
[26:49] things but I've always I've always said
[26:53] I don't know how they're going to stop
[26:54] you from doing that but
[27:01] it's really
[27:02] cool
[27:03] saying go ahead yeah
[27:06] my my daughter who lives above us uh she
[27:11] works with her husband her husband is
[27:13] blind he's a lawyer for the electric
[27:16] company so she reads him the documents
[27:18] and so she works all day so it's hard
[27:20] for her to cook food for them so we cook
[27:23] food and so I I I told her
[27:26] okay since my job to wash the dishes we
[27:30] we flipped back and forth I said how
[27:32] about if you wash the dishes all the
[27:34] time and I'll give you this many Satoshi
[27:36] so I've been technically illegal here in
[27:39] Ecuador paying for services but oh I
[27:43] shouldn't say that hopefully no nobody
[27:44] from the offroad is is
[27:46] watching but yeah what for for me it's
[27:50] interesting with all your life
[27:51] experience what made it click for you
[27:54] like when when you got Bitcoin and you
[27:56] learned about it what made it click like
[27:58] oh oh that's the new technology I should
[28:00] get invested in well I I think part of
[28:02] that comes from my past a lot I I'm a
[28:05] very religious person I'm a member of
[28:07] the Church of Jesus Christ of latterday
[28:10] saints which uh also known as Mormon of
[28:14] the Mormons do you know why it's called
[28:16] they use the word Mormons no I have no
[28:19] clue yeah it's because we have a a
[28:22] second book that we call it's a second
[28:26] testimony of Christ
[28:29] called The Book of Mormon Mormon was a
[28:33] prophet on the Americas in and sometime
[28:37] you know uh kind of between 400 and
[28:40] 1,000 BC there's a history of a people
[28:44] that lived here that actually came from
[28:46] Jerusalem and so it's a it's a great
[28:49] book I I you know I I read it you know
[28:52] quite often because it has a lot of good
[28:55] stories and a lot of good uh well I
[28:58] think it's got a lot of good Doctrine
[29:01] also and so but that's how come we
[29:05] believe that uh a young man named Joseph
[29:09] Smith uh was able to translate that
[29:12] through the uh power of
[29:15] God and so we believe it as a scripture
[29:19] just like the Bible we use the Bible and
[29:21] the
[29:22] scriptures so when Mormon when they say
[29:25] Mormons aren't aren't Christians we go
[29:27] well the real name of the church is the
[29:29] Church of Jesus Christ of latterday
[29:31] saints so I was born in the church my
[29:33] father joined the church when he was a
[29:35] young man my mother is from Pioneer
[29:38] stock she has uh Generations in the
[29:42] church and uh so my family I come from a
[29:46] family of six I was the fourth fourth
[29:49] kid we still have four of us
[29:51] left out of the
[29:54] six H and uh but I grew up in the church
[29:58] CH and that's I went on a mission for
[30:00] the church to uh to Monterey
[30:03] Mexico and that's where I learned
[30:05] Spanish is there a a connection between
[30:08] religion and and
[30:10] Bitcoin well I think the the the thing
[30:13] for me is that I'm always looking for
[30:15] truth and I think that and that's why
[30:19] Jeff boo book really talked to me when I
[30:21] read it because I understand the
[30:24] technology that he was talking about
[30:27] that that was nothing new to me but when
[30:29] he started to say the only way that you
[30:33] need you need a money that will be able
[30:36] to grow with this in with this
[30:39] technology and and I mean is the whole
[30:42] book is really not about Bitcoin there's
[30:44] only like one one chapter or or a few
[30:49] pages about Bitcoin but when I read that
[30:53] book it was kind of like okay yeah I can
[30:55] see this and I can see how it could work
[30:58] and as I started to continue to study I
[31:01] finally came out that Bitcoin is truth
[31:05] if you look at you know based on even
[31:07] the time chain the time chain proves
[31:11] everything so it's it's you can always
[31:14] verify you can always do stuff and so I
[31:18] I believe Bitcoin is a source of Truth
[31:22] and I believe that my church is my other
[31:25] source of Truth so I I
[31:28] uh have
[31:30] used you know I I served I I didn't I I
[31:34] grew up in the church but I still had to
[31:36] gain my own
[31:38] testimony of of the church you know that
[31:42] that it was you know something good for
[31:45] me and that I believe that it was
[31:48] true uh we have you know one of the
[31:51] we're not really a a restored or a
[31:54] reformed chur Church like the you know
[31:58] you had the Catholics and the Lutheran
[31:59] and all those others that broke away
[32:02] we're what we are what we call a
[32:04] restored
[32:05] Church uh restoring the exact
[32:10] organization and the exact stuff that uh
[32:14] Christ put on the earth when he was here
[32:16] with his Apostles and and Prophets and
[32:20] that kind of stuff and one of the things
[32:24] I always say is we believe the Bible in
[32:26] all in all of it
[32:29] no so not not just pieces of it so one
[32:33] of the verses in Amos says that the Lord
[32:36] God will do nothing sa he reveals it
[32:39] unto its
[32:41] Prophet so if God is not doing anything
[32:44] in the
[32:45] earth well God can't be doing anything
[32:48] in Earth if there's no
[32:53] prophets that's one of the things we
[32:54] believe that we have a a prophet we have
[32:57] have Apostles and that kind of thing and
[33:01] so I I think one of the things that
[33:04] helped me understand Bitcoin as a source
[33:07] of Truth was that background that I over
[33:10] time I have always searched for for this
[33:14] truth reading and trying to understand
[33:17] the the the basis of life really you
[33:20] know why are we here where you know
[33:24] where are we going where' we come from
[33:26] those kinds of truths
[33:28] uh and I believe that uh we are one of
[33:32] the only churches that have the full
[33:34] truth because uh we believe in we have a
[33:39] a belief of where we came from we have a
[33:41] belief of where we're going we have a
[33:44] one of the reasons that there's temples
[33:46] in all the world is to do work for for
[33:50] those who've passed on
[33:53] because uh Christ said that you can't
[33:56] enter into heaven without being
[33:58] baptized so what about those people in
[34:01] India or in China or all the other parts
[34:05] of the world that we don't
[34:07] even uh that have never even heard the
[34:10] name of Jesus Christ how are they going
[34:12] to be baptized in his name we we believe
[34:15] that one of the works that we do in the
[34:17] temple is baptisms for the dead we do uh
[34:21] you know work for for all of the people
[34:24] one of the things I do here on my
[34:26] computer every day is I I take documents
[34:29] and I index
[34:30] them into in you know so that the
[34:34] computers can read them to be able to
[34:37] have the names and then people can those
[34:39] go into into uh genealogical research
[34:43] databases and that kind of stuff also so
[34:46] people looking for their genealogy or
[34:48] their their past can uh can use the
[34:53] stuff that I put in every day you know
[34:56] right now I'm working in
[34:59] Zimbabwe Church registers in Zimbabwe I
[35:03] I read their their records and I I type
[35:06] them over into a into a screen on the
[35:09] computer so that the computer can
[35:12] basically have those
[35:14] records and then those records later can
[35:16] be used for for doing the work for the
[35:20] people now we don't think we're doing
[35:23] the work and they have to accept it we
[35:26] we believe that after death we go to a a
[35:29] place where our spirits still live and
[35:32] that we still have the ability to grow
[35:35] and progress in that spirit world and
[35:39] that that's where we would somebody
[35:42] would have the opportunity to accept
[35:44] this baptism and say yes I believe and I
[35:47] want this
[35:48] baptism oh that kind of thing really
[35:53] really cool um I'm also curious about as
[35:56] as you are just like like from my life
[35:59] experience so so far ahead um what is
[36:01] the the biggest lessons you until now
[36:04] like with ination with technology but
[36:07] also General Life what is your like if
[36:09] you had to put it in one lesson what's
[36:11] what's the the biggest one for you be
[36:13] nice I love that
[36:16] one be kind spread Bitcoin with love
[36:20] yeah no I I think being kind is probably
[36:24] the one best thing that you can do with
[36:26] people criticizing and and uh and you
[36:32] know all the hate that goes on on the
[36:34] internet and and talking about uh stuff
[36:38] I I I don't get into that at all I don't
[36:41] like it because to me you're that goes
[36:45] back to my basic belief that all people
[36:48] are children of God and so you are
[36:52] basically not just my friend but you are
[36:55] my brother
[36:57] okay because you're one of my spirit
[37:00] Brothers you got born in Austria I got
[37:03] born in Utah but we're still you know we
[37:06] might have known each other up above and
[37:09] we said about there hey someday we're
[37:11] going to be great friends so I I think
[37:14] if we treat everybody like they are our
[37:18] brothers and sisters you know that that
[37:23] which they truly are in in the spirit we
[37:25] are truly Brothers and sisters of each
[37:28] other and we should treat each other in
[37:30] that fashion so my my main thing I found
[37:33] in life is to just be as kind as I can
[37:36] and when I when I blow it I try to
[37:39] recognize that I've blown it and I try
[37:41] to go back and say I'm sorry I you know
[37:44] I I didn't do well here I'd like to to
[37:47] make amends to this because to me that's
[37:50] the most important thing people are the
[37:52] most important things
[37:54] family is is way important
[37:58] I have uh 10 kids and 17
[38:03] grandchildren oh 10 kids
[38:05] wow well four of them are mine
[38:08] originally four of them are mine
[38:10] originally I was married for 28
[38:14] years uh and had four children two uh
[38:17] three boys and one
[38:19] girl then uh my uh I always say my uh my
[38:25] wife got I I married her out of high
[38:27] school and I got her through a master's
[38:28] in education so she uh you know she
[38:32] worked hard at it though she's a she was
[38:34] a very good student very smart person
[38:38] and uh but then in the end we just kind
[38:40] of went our separate ways so we decided
[38:42] to after our children were all raised we
[38:46] decided to
[38:48] separate and so then I remarried and
[38:51] found what I thought was the love of my
[38:53] life forever but in in the end I I ended
[38:58] up uh uh she ended up passing away in
[39:02] 2020 not not directly from Co but a
[39:06] little bit because of Co she needed an
[39:08] operation and they shut the hospitals
[39:11] down and they and they she was ready for
[39:14] the operation and they they shut the H
[39:17] the hospital down they couldn't do the
[39:19] operations until her health had now gone
[39:22] down to the point of where when she went
[39:24] into the surgery it uh ended up damaging
[39:27] junor because they couldn't they they
[39:29] really her her health system had had uh
[39:33] denigrated that much so I I say it was
[39:38] because of Co but it wasn't because of
[39:40] Co but kind of the the reason that she
[39:43] passed away I I think was because of
[39:46] Co and so uh and then I didn't think I
[39:50] was going to ever get married again
[39:52] until I met my current wife and uh now
[39:56] she's the love of my life life
[39:58] so but there again I you know my my
[40:02] second wife and I were married in the
[40:05] temple sealed in the temple so we are
[40:08] sealed for time and all
[40:10] eternity and so will my second wife be
[40:13] sealed to me
[40:14] also so in the in the in the future
[40:18] we'll have a good family I love that
[40:20] Spirit of yours I love I love how how
[40:22] you think about that a lot do you have
[40:24] any regrets in in love I have two kids
[40:26] for her I have have two kids from her
[40:28] that I call my
[40:30] sons and then I have four daughters from
[40:33] my current wife she has four daughters
[40:36] so I have five and five I have five boys
[40:39] and five girls and I've got I've got
[40:42] kids that are older than you I I imagine
[40:45] 50 years in between my old my oldest son
[40:47] is in his in his mid yeah my my dad is
[40:50] in my in his
[40:54] mid-50s yeah so so I'm like a grandkid
[40:56] actually
[40:58] yeah yeah because I I've got well I've
[41:00] got grandkids that are older than you so
[41:03] I love it but I've got some that are
[41:06] younger too
[41:08] so but yeah no I I think the thing that
[41:11] you know because of my life experience
[41:14] and the the things I've done through
[41:16] missionary work and through uh through
[41:21] service I just found a happiness that I
[41:24] can't I it's hard for me to contain
[41:27] how happy I really am because the the
[41:31] and and this one of the reasons why I'm
[41:33] real happy about Bitcoin because I
[41:35] believe um there was someone on um on
[41:39] Noster that said you know what do you
[41:42] think about religion and and this and I
[41:44] so I I replied I said you know I'm a
[41:47] member of the Church of Jesus Christ of
[41:48] latterday saints and I believe that
[41:52] these both sources of Truth Bitcoin and
[41:56] and my church shirts are the source of
[41:58] Truth for me and so that's uh and that's
[42:02] what I think Jeff Booth showed me when I
[42:05] read that book and straight Bitcoin and
[42:08] and slowly got rid of all my alts I
[42:10] still had a few alts on on celsus that I
[42:13] was waiting for them to get back you
[42:16] know from my in you know trying to get
[42:18] my investment back but I I lost all
[42:21] those
[42:23] so um that's that's I love it a lot
[42:26] already um first of all like thank you
[42:29] for for for taking your time and and
[42:30] doing that uh and I think we already
[42:32] learned a lot from you um before we come
[42:34] to the end routine I have now a new uh
[42:36] format that I always ask my my guests
[42:39] before we come to the end routine uh
[42:41] which we kind of already touched on but
[42:44] what can we learn from you Steve uh
[42:46] besides Bitcoin besides all the things
[42:48] that we already talked about I think
[42:50] that that's the major thing that people
[42:52] can learn from me is uh well to to f
[42:56] first of all continue to learn
[42:59] always always be learning I think one of
[43:03] the reasons why I'm I'm healthy mentally
[43:07] and that kind of stuff at my age is part
[43:10] because I've always learned I always
[43:12] read I listen to a lot of books on audio
[43:16] I you know I'm always constantly
[43:18] striving to learn something um and then
[43:22] basically be nice be kind to one another
[43:27] help everybody uh to to learn if they
[43:31] don't understand Bitcoin explain it to
[43:34] them and when they come back again
[43:36] explain it to them again and never get
[43:38] frustrated because it's always there it
[43:41] takes time for people to change their
[43:43] minds about stuff I didn't get it right
[43:46] away you know if I if I would have got
[43:49] it when I first you know I bought my
[43:51] first Bitcoin on Robin Hood so you know
[43:54] because I was just you know it to me it
[43:56] was just a money it was just a a
[43:58] cryptocurrency I don't know what it's
[44:01] about
[44:02] but it takes time to learn and so be
[44:06] patient be help people I'm trying to
[44:09] translate documents into Spanish I uh
[44:12] found that uh PPT on what is money and I
[44:16] went through with chat GTP and I
[44:19] converted all the slides to Spanish so
[44:23] that so that I could uh share that with
[44:26] people
[44:27] I did want to Jeff boost the finding
[44:29] noise uh s signal in a noisy world I've
[44:34] translated that also so that that's kind
[44:37] of one of the things that just
[44:39] constantly learn constantly strive
[44:43] constantly uh look forward to the future
[44:46] because the future is bright and if I
[44:49] had my shades here I'd put them
[44:53] on I love your spirit Steve it's really
[44:56] cool to to speak with you um I also
[44:58] shared before we started the podcast one
[45:00] statistic with you that we actually have
[45:04] uh six or 7% uh of viewers above uh 65
[45:09] years old um which is for me amazing
[45:12] that uh people of that age are willing
[45:14] to listen to some such a young folk that
[45:17] have a has a bit Bitcoin podcast um what
[45:20] message do you have for people above 65
[45:24] that don't have Bitcoin now like why
[45:26] should they be still involved in in
[45:28] Bitcoin or what could help them uh to
[45:32] understand Bitcoin I think that it's
[45:34] never too late and that you have to uh
[45:37] you know take a little bit of time uh
[45:40] before you reject anything the best
[45:43] thing to do is to study it and to
[45:46] understand at least a little bit about
[45:48] it uh before you can say well maybe
[45:51] that's not for me right
[45:52] now but as an older person I don't think
[45:56] it's too late I think uh you know even
[46:00] though you may not be able to like I
[46:02] can't afford a lot of Bitcoin right now
[46:05] I wish I could whenever I get a chunk of
[46:08] money I use most of it to buy Bitcoin
[46:11] but my daily DCA is what I I try to do I
[46:15] look every day I have it on strike so it
[46:19] gives me my phone year you know today I
[46:21] bought 15,000 Satoshi
[46:25] so and I'm always happy I'm always happy
[46:28] to see the price go
[46:31] down that's me me too because I'm like I
[46:35] have my whole life in front of me I want
[46:37] to buy now Bitcoin as cheap as possible
[46:40] to have it later later in life um we
[46:44] come to the endro team now where the
[46:46] previous guest is asking a question for
[46:47] the next guest without knowing who the
[46:49] next guest actually is uh and the
[46:52] question for you is how do you think
[46:55] personally uh uh cbdcs will impact you I
[46:59] think they'll probably impact me on the
[47:01] basis that they'll probably change my
[47:03] Social Security payment over to that so
[47:06] I you know so right now it it goes into
[47:10] my bank account and I think they'll
[47:13] probably make it so that it comes
[47:15] through a cbdc so it'll be interesting
[47:17] to see how easy it is to get it out and
[47:20] and buy Bitcoin with it yeah you know
[47:23] I'm how can I say I'm not afraid of CBD
[47:27] as much as uh because I will use it just
[47:31] like I use my bank account today I
[47:34] believe but you know uh and maybe
[47:38] they'll they maybe they'll surprise me
[47:40] and be worse than I am you know I I
[47:42] think uh cbdc in the United States is
[47:46] going to be different than the cbdc in
[47:49] China or cbdc in in places that that
[47:53] look for more control like the thing
[47:55] that we put in the the chat the other
[47:58] day about you know the EU wanting to
[48:01] register all your stuff oh yeah I I
[48:04] don't think I would I don't think I
[48:05] would enjoy that but I'll be I'm gon to
[48:08] be moving back to the United States for
[48:10] a little while as soon as my wife's Visa
[48:13] comes in and then I'll be up there for a
[48:17] while then hopefully we'll be able to
[48:19] travel back and forth so I don't ever
[48:20] have to spend another winter in the
[48:22] United States yeah it's I I kind of also
[48:25] play with the more more to be outside of
[48:28] the EU uh and not inside of the EU but
[48:32] yeah it's it will be interesting to see
[48:34] how it all plays out but I think if you
[48:36] have Bitcoin uh we don't have to worry
[48:40] that much about cbdcs that's that's what
[48:42] I believe um really cool thank you uh
