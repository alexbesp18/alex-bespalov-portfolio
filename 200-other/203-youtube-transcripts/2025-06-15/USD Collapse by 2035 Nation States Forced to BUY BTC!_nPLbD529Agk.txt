--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] 2024 will be recognized as the year when
[00:02] the nation state adoption has actually
[00:04] kicked off and governments beginning to
[00:05] collapse in certain countries so we've
[00:07] seen that in Germany we're seeing it
[00:08] happening in my home country of Canada
[00:10] now and we're just seeing the kind of
[00:11] instability that's happened from the the
[00:13] irresponsible spending we're seeing
[00:14] things break we're seeing the GFC the
[00:16] great financial crisis we're seeing the
[00:17] current inflation cost of living crisis
[00:20] we're witnessing loss of faith in in the
[00:22] institutions all of these things are
[00:24] systemic and also symptomatic of of a
[00:25] core mismatch between the systems and
[00:28] where you know reality is going the
[00:29] nation State itself will dissolve once
[00:31] governments realize that they don't have
[00:33] control over the money system
[00:34] individuals will have more sovereignty
[00:36] as they custody their own Bitcoin and be
[00:38] able to kind of move more seamlessly to
[00:41] where they are more aligned to the the
[00:43] governments that under which they they
[00:44] choose to live Bitcoin has the
[00:45] fundamental monetary basis without
[00:46] necessarily having the need for these
[00:48] kind of Fiat derivatives based on top
[00:49] maybe that's 50 years down the road
[00:51] maybe it's only 10 years down the road
[00:52] it's probably going to happen faster
[00:53] than we assume I don't see Bitcoin as
[00:54] being a human only monetary system the
[00:57] programmability gives it a much longer
[00:59] long vity potentially hundreds thousands
[01:01] of
[01:02] [Music]
[01:06] years how do you look actually back
[01:08] because I think like at the end of the
[01:09] year this podcast will actually come out
[01:11] probably already in January like the
[01:13] first week of January but still end of
[01:15] the year first year of January um people
[01:18] like to look back at the year like to
[01:20] like see like what are the highlights uh
[01:22] and I I really want to go with you today
[01:24] in a geopolitical aspect and I think
[01:26] this year is
[01:27] a a really interesting fun fundamental
[01:30] basis to that GE geopolitical aspect to
[01:33] it um what what is kind of like your
[01:36] highlights of this year and and yeah
[01:38] what what is some of your highlights of
[01:40] Bitcoin this year yeah I think I think
[01:42] 2024 will be recognized as the year when
[01:44] the uh the nation state adoption has
[01:47] actually kicked off in in full force I
[01:49] mean the nation states haven't really
[01:51] started actively accumulating but
[01:53] there's already the um the announcements
[01:55] and I think that's enough to Kickstart
[01:57] the the game theory and putting that
[01:58] into action um so I think of course the
[02:01] Trump um and uh and RFK Jr announcements
[02:05] at Bitcoin Nashville in the summer were
[02:07] a real big
[02:08] highlight um and then that followed up
[02:11] with the Lumis bill in the US I think um
[02:13] I personally was quite surprised that
[02:15] the US would actually be the the first
[02:17] mover in the space I think in hindsight
[02:19] maybe I shouldn't be so surprised but I
[02:20] actually thought um that Bitcoin would
[02:23] be something where the the smaller uh
[02:25] countries with let's say less to lose
[02:27] and more to gain um would be uh the one
[02:30] that would take the front seat and to a
[02:31] certain extent uh that has been the case
[02:33] with El Salvador and Bhutan um but I
[02:36] would have thought that the us would
[02:38] have the most to lose and therefore be
[02:39] the the most resistant resistant to uh
[02:42] to adopting Bitcoin um and that might
[02:45] have well been the case if Trump hadn't
[02:46] gotten elected actually so I think it's
[02:48] um it's great to see in some senses that
[02:50] the US has uh has is going down that
[02:53] direction now um and that's really in
[02:56] some senses accelerated the uh the
[02:58] nation state adoption story in a really
[03:00] big way um I think that's also happening
[03:03] on the the backdrop of and I think what
[03:05] we've seen of course following that is
[03:06] more announcements from um some elected
[03:09] officials and some uh um campaigning to
[03:13] be elected in other countries like um uh
[03:17] Surinam and uh um Poland and others so I
[03:21] think there we are seeing that um those
[03:24] uh big uh sweeping political Tendencies
[03:27] now um and then I think that's happening
[03:29] on the backdrop also seeing many um
[03:32] let's say center-left governments
[03:34] beginning to collapse in certain
[03:35] countries so we've seen that in Germany
[03:37] um we're seeing it happen in my home
[03:38] country of Canada now um and we're just
[03:41] seeing the kind of instability that's
[03:43] happened from the the irresponsible
[03:44] spending during covid now starting to
[03:47] take uh um the after effects starting to
[03:50] become visible and apparent um and what
[03:52] the the um uh irresponsible spending of
[03:57] governments who have access to money
[03:59] printers
[04:00] what the result can happen in those
[04:01] cases really interesting uh why did you
[04:04] move from Canada to Denmark what was the
[04:06] move there I think I I interviewed
[04:09] someone else also that made that move
[04:11] that's why it's to C to me because
[04:13] exactly Canada to Denmark okay yeah so
[04:16] it wasn't directly from Canada to
[04:17] Denmark in my case it was um I had been
[04:19] working as an engineer in Canada for 5
[04:22] years after finishing my studies um and
[04:24] I had always had a dream to kind of work
[04:26] and live internationally and decided to
[04:28] kind of take the plunge when I was about
[04:30] 27 years old and came to Europe
[04:32] initially just uh as a sabatical year
[04:34] came with my bicycle traveled around on
[04:36] bike for a few months and then landed in
[04:39] Berlin uh in the summer of 2012 um and
[04:43] decided to set up shop there for about a
[04:44] year and it was actually while I was in
[04:46] Berlin that I discovered Bitcoin for the
[04:48] first time um and uh so it was around
[04:51] December November December of 2012 when
[04:53] I uh made my first purchase through
[04:56] through Mount gaau um and uh at that
[05:00] time I was also very much influenced by
[05:01] Watching Max Kaiser and Stacy Herbert on
[05:04] um on the show they had on RT at the
[05:07] time um and that's where I think I
[05:09] initially got orange pilled I don't
[05:11] think that uh that term existed back
[05:13] then um but that was uh yeah that kind
[05:17] of I went very much down the rabbit hole
[05:18] I didn't have a like a full-time job or
[05:20] studies or anything I really had a lot
[05:21] of time off so I had the opportunity to
[05:23] kind of stay up late and and just do a
[05:25] lot of um thinking and Research into the
[05:26] space there's a lot fewer thinkers uh
[05:29] and podcasters and everything in the
[05:30] space at that time but um really
[05:32] thinking about what the the long-term
[05:34] implications would be um sadly at that
[05:36] time I didn't have enough personal
[05:37] conviction to put too much money uh into
[05:40] it um and in fact I kind of went through
[05:42] the the same path a lot of people do
[05:43] where they just see the price volatility
[05:45] moving from $30 to $100 and try to make
[05:47] a quick Buck uh by selling on the market
[05:51] um and in hindsight obviously that was
[05:53] uh yeah a foolish uh path to go down um
[05:56] but then over the next few waves I
[05:57] started getting more and more conviction
[06:00] um and uh and now I'm same like a highly
[06:03] convicted person when it comes to to
[06:05] bitcoin but but anyhow how I got back to
[06:07] Denmark I um after my time in Berlin I
[06:09] uh I did a a one-year master's program
[06:11] um and then uh got offered a job with um
[06:15] a big consultancy uh out of Oslo and
[06:18] then from there got exposure to a big
[06:20] corporate client uh in Copenhagen and uh
[06:23] worked in corporate strategy with them
[06:25] here in Copenhagen and then I actually
[06:27] did a stint in uh Vienna I lived in
[06:28] Vienna for a few times in between
[06:30] Copenhagen so I've uh I've worked there
[06:32] with your big oil and gas company um in
[06:35] 2018 and 19 and then um and then later
[06:38] on a crypto brokerage called bit Panda
[06:40] uh for a year and a half um a few years
[06:43] ago oh yeah bit panda is one of the
[06:46] biggest uh crypto exchanges in in Europe
[06:49] now right it's I don't have them on the
[06:51] radar because I only look at Bitcoin
[06:52] only companies but like honestly they
[06:55] they are huge like the one of the uh
[06:59] rare examples of really big successful
[07:02] Austrian companies like there's like Red
[07:04] Bull verovski and there are some some
[07:07] big names out there but they're usually
[07:08] older bit Bund is um a recent success
[07:12] story and it's interesting that we that
[07:14] we have that with the current political
[07:16] landscape one thing that you really said
[07:19] that you said was interesting um because
[07:21] back then when you got orange built and
[07:23] it got better every year and I feel like
[07:26] especially 2022 2021 it got really
[07:29] really good uh we have way more amazing
[07:32] Educators now in the space uh you have
[07:36] of course your big ones like m cyer in
[07:38] MO Natalie prunell Jeff Bo all all the
[07:40] big ones but you also have so many uh
[07:45] tier two tier three Educators that do
[07:48] great content do uh so much content so
[07:52] so much quality and quantity of the
[07:53] content where it's just way easier to
[07:56] fall down the the rabbit hole now than
[08:00] it was in like five years ago 10 years
[08:02] ago and definitely 15 years ago uh and
[08:06] that that's something that I look at and
[08:08] was like oh I I see now people that came
[08:11] into I don't know June 2024 the end of
[08:15] the first time Bitcoin and they already
[08:18] know so much they already so educated on
[08:21] bitcoin where I'm like I need it so much
[08:23] longer for that because there has not
[08:25] been as good of education and I ended in
[08:28] a good time like 20 imagine someone
[08:30] entering in 2015 or 2012 or something
[08:33] like that so I I think that's an
[08:36] underrated accelerating factor for the
[08:40] whole Bitcoin uh adoption how do you see
[08:43] that or how did You observe that yeah I
[08:45] mean certainly and uh I think in my own
[08:47] story I did kind of go cold for a period
[08:49] because of the mount goau hack I think
[08:50] that kind of shot me away away from
[08:52] Bitcoin uh for for a number of years but
[08:54] but I think uh I do feel like there's
[08:56] just much more Rich um options space
[09:00] that appeal to different types of
[09:01] personalities uh in the Bitcoin space so
[09:03] it's much more diverse uh landscape and
[09:06] then I think the rabbit hole itself to
[09:07] maintain that metaphor it has it's just
[09:09] a bigger Rabbit Hole there's more
[09:10] Caverns to explore um and I think that's
[09:13] the really cool thing with Bitcoin kind
[09:14] of more holistically is that um it isn't
[09:17] one thing I mean it is at its instance
[09:19] like a monetary technology right but but
[09:21] its implications are so um
[09:24] multi-dimensional right um in the sense
[09:26] that it's going to you know my
[09:27] perspective I think it's you know going
[09:28] to change the the Global Financial
[09:30] system I think most people would agree
[09:32] with that but then uh as a result I
[09:34] think you know ultimately have political
[09:35] implications change the geopolitical
[09:37] order that we're existing in uh
[09:39] potentially change the entire
[09:41] geopolitical political Paradigm Beyond
[09:43] nation states um and then also I think
[09:46] at a a core societal um implications in
[09:49] terms of you know how we spend our time
[09:51] as individuals and the relationships we
[09:53] have with uh with others so I think
[09:55] that's given that it it can and trans I
[09:58] think that's something great about your
[09:59] podcast is you bring in people with all
[10:00] these different perspectives um that
[10:02] explore the different caverns and nooks
[10:04] and crannies of of of Bitcoin um but it
[10:07] is a very rich tapestry to kind of you
[10:09] know explore and um and uh understand so
[10:13] it's really cool absolutely and I want
[10:15] to get back to the to the to the topic
[10:17] that I wanted to to get with the
[10:19] geopolitical thing and I think you're
[10:21] right on when you say like for me also
[10:23] El Salvador was was way earlier than I
[10:27] thought and us a was way way more early
[10:31] than I thought because El Salvador is
[10:33] kind of um a country that you would
[10:37] think is primed to adopt Bitcoin it's a
[10:41] struggling country it's a country that
[10:43] is depending on the US dollar they
[10:46] enough monetary control in a sense yes
[10:48] so they had nothing to lose in some ways
[10:50] right absolutely and exactly they they
[10:53] are primed to do that but the USA that
[10:55] that's surprising for me to be honest uh
[10:58] and uh even in hindsight to be honest
[11:00] like I I still don't get um why they are
[11:04] so early why other countries that are
[11:06] struggling way more are not as
[11:08] aggressive why is Argentina not more
[11:10] aggressive on bitcoin yes they have this
[11:12] like oh let's have a free
[11:15] competition but but America seems to be
[11:18] like already one step ahead of of of
[11:21] that like they thinking about strategic
[11:23] Reserve currency yes in the EU uh we
[11:26] also have now one French woman that
[11:28] stand out say like proposed that plan
[11:31] but it's like one out of how many 700 or
[11:33] something like that uh it's not a lot in
[11:36] Germany yes we have now a as you said
[11:39] centered left government that has
[11:41] completely failed uh in the post the
[11:43] whole government structure that was uh
[11:46] before like at
[11:48] 60% um rate they have now 30% agreement
[11:52] of the general population uh so those
[11:55] things are really escalating quickly um
[11:59] what is your kind of like a thought
[12:01] around the current geopolitical
[12:04] landscape and maybe then we can move
[12:06] towards how how do you think Bitcoin
[12:08] will change it in the future yeah I mean
[12:10] the current landscape is I mean I
[12:12] haven't I I don't tend to see myself as
[12:14] a political analyst so I have haven't
[12:15] really been following too deep into any
[12:18] specific Count's um policies uh from a
[12:21] non-bitcoin perspective I think um but
[12:23] definitely I think we're seeing I would
[12:24] say this I mean I think what's being
[12:27] seen in our kind of day and age both in
[12:29] terms of politics and also when it comes
[12:31] to the monetary system and the way
[12:33] people live been lives I think we're
[12:34] seeing evidence that Sy symptoms of the
[12:37] fact that we've sort of the systems that
[12:39] we're we've built around ourselves are
[12:41] have reached their limit and we're
[12:42] seeing things break right we're seeing
[12:44] uh we're seeing the GFC the great
[12:46] financial crisis we're seeing um the
[12:49] current uh inflation cost of living
[12:51] crisis that is pervasive across the
[12:53] entire developed World um we're
[12:56] witnessing um loss of faith in in the
[12:59] institutions uh so I think all of these
[13:02] things are are systemic and also
[13:04] symptomatic of of a core um mismatch I
[13:09] think between the systems and where you
[13:11] know reality is going to in terms of you
[13:12] know technology and the way we live our
[13:14] lives and so forth and also probably a
[13:15] symptom of demographic change as well to
[13:18] a certain degree so I think within that
[13:20] context um I think then Bitcoin comes in
[13:23] and I think to a large degree it's a
[13:25] solution I wouldn't say it's a Panacea
[13:26] that's necessarily going to solve
[13:27] everything I think I hear a lot of
[13:29] people say perfect money and I I don't
[13:32] believe in ideals I think it's a more
[13:33] perfect money I think it will some flaws
[13:36] will be exposed over time um but but
[13:40] overall it will be the solution for for
[13:42] many of the problems we're facing today
[13:44] um and then to kind of focus in on the
[13:47] US and maybe what would have drawn them
[13:48] to to move faster than what one you know
[13:50] outside observers like us might have
[13:52] imagined um you know I think at the end
[13:55] of the day they have the most uh
[13:57] widespread surveillance Network and
[13:58] intell agency of the world where very
[14:01] few people are privy to what they are
[14:03] having the discussions they're having
[14:04] internally and I think there's already
[14:05] been prior to bitcoin the Rumblings of
[14:08] the US Dollars hemony how important that
[14:10] is to to its economic uh Primacy
[14:13] globally and and as a result also his
[14:15] ability to kind of influence itself um
[14:18] at a at a at a um World level so I think
[14:22] I'd be surprised if they if if the best
[14:24] you know intelligence thinkers um would
[14:27] be would look at Bitcoin and say no this
[14:28] is just nothing
[14:30] uh for the last 15 years I think they
[14:31] might have started with that view but um
[14:34] I imagine that at some point something
[14:35] flipped and that they started actually
[14:37] recognizing it for what it was and then
[14:38] I think there would have been a
[14:39] discussion about you know um when's the
[14:42] right time to act uh what are the pros
[14:44] and cons how do we do this and so I do
[14:46] think that behind the scenes they
[14:48] probably have some they've done some
[14:49] real thinking and there's been a
[14:51] strategy invoked and um and Maybe not
[14:53] maybe it is just organic and just Sy the
[14:55] AL Lumis one Senator out of Wyoming to
[14:57] propose this and and you know and Trump
[14:59] just happened to have a few
[15:00] conversations but I I I I think maybe
[15:02] the conspiracy theorist me thinks that
[15:04] there's kind of real analysis in state
[15:06] agencies that have been following and
[15:08] thinking and planning and strategizing
[15:10] uh with regards to bitcoin um I would
[15:12] have hoped it would be the other way
[15:13] because I think that would have resulted
[15:14] in a more I think revolutionary change
[15:18] um and I think what we're seeing is as
[15:19] Us's first mover probably will maintain
[15:22] its hedony going into the future um as a
[15:26] result um so so I think even though
[15:28] there will be
[15:29] pretty massive political changes in the
[15:32] in the order uh it does appear now that
[15:34] you know I think the US will will
[15:36] maintain hemony but hopefully in a way
[15:38] that's more you know righteous and less
[15:40] militaristic than than they have in the
[15:42] past interesting um do you think that
[15:47] what implication does that on on the US
[15:49] dollar itself has do you think that is
[15:52] will will have an effect of even
[15:55] prolonging uh and bettering the US
[15:57] dollar long term because they can back
[16:00] it with with Bitcoin and they can have
[16:02] the early move advantage while being the
[16:05] the world dominant
[16:07] Force yeah I think it's going to be both
[16:10] that and and not that I think it's going
[16:11] to in my mind it's going to be the
[16:13] medium term the will the it'll be
[16:17] backing the US dollar with Bitcoin or
[16:19] Bitcoin based derivatives of some sort
[16:21] but I do think that that's just going to
[16:23] be the intermediate phase because I do
[16:24] think the longer term View and I think
[16:26] this is consistent with what guys like
[16:28] Samson Mau are saying you know I think
[16:29] the nation state itself will in some
[16:32] sense dissolve I I think once
[16:34] governments realize that you know the
[16:36] they don't have control over the money
[16:38] system I think they will first of all
[16:41] have to constrict contract in terms of
[16:43] what they can and can't do and kind of
[16:44] spend within their means and really
[16:45] focus on what's really important I think
[16:48] that's also going to be matched with the
[16:50] fact that individuals will have more
[16:52] sovereignty as they as they custody
[16:54] their own Bitcoin and be able to kind of
[16:56] move more seamlessly to where um where
[17:00] they are more aligned to the the
[17:02] governments that they um that under
[17:05] which they they choose to live um and
[17:08] then I think ultimately uh um you know
[17:12] the the powers of these establishments
[17:16] will ultimately be diminished and and
[17:18] then then reformed in some way I think
[17:20] right in a way that that is adaptable to
[17:22] bitcoin as a as the fundamental monetary
[17:24] basis without necessarily having the
[17:25] need for these kind of Fiat derivatives
[17:28] based on top but how long it takes to
[17:30] get there again maybe that's 50 years
[17:32] down the road maybe it's only 10 years
[17:33] down the road I it's hard to say right
[17:36] 10 10 years would be uh it's interesting
[17:40] do you think that can happen that that
[17:42] quick uh where or or for me it's always
[17:46] really hard to imagine that happening
[17:49] because I've grown up with that
[17:50] political system I'm like that's so huge
[17:53] that's so big and it's so anchored in in
[17:56] our perspective um
[17:59] and I see now how long it takes for
[18:02] people to understand Bitcoin and to
[18:04] accept small changes like except like
[18:06] just a little Bitcoin allocation in in
[18:09] their
[18:10] portfolios um 10 years 15 years it seems
[18:14] really um how should I say it
[18:18] like really aggressive even like really
[18:21] really uh really fast uh do you think
[18:24] there's like a chance that it takes like
[18:25] maybe 50 years or like even longer than
[18:28] that
[18:29] yeah I mean I think it could it could be
[18:30] hundred years out too right but I think
[18:32] in general we tend to underestimate I
[18:33] think that's the thing about human um uh
[18:37] psych psychology uh in general I think
[18:39] there's some instances where we
[18:40] overestimate uh let's see overestimate
[18:44] how fast something can happen how
[18:45] quickly um but I think it tends to be
[18:47] the other way around where we do think
[18:49] about these linear perspectives when
[18:52] when many of these adoption curves
[18:53] happen in in these S curves that we talk
[18:55] about and I mean maybe if you think
[18:57] about the French Revolution talking to
[18:59] French people in the 1770s um about
[19:02] would there ever be something beyond the
[19:03] monarchy you know at that time probably
[19:05] people say maybe at some point 100 years
[19:07] from now or 200 years from now um and
[19:09] then in you know the 17 1780s uh you
[19:13] know there's a whole Revolution a whole
[19:14] new system that emerges um of course in
[19:17] that context a lot of uh violence and
[19:21] conflict uh for decades afterwards um
[19:24] which might also be the case in in this
[19:26] in this political revolution as well um
[19:29] but uh but no I think I think you know I
[19:32] don't know for certain when it would
[19:33] happen but I do think if we're going to
[19:34] choose an average point it's probably
[19:36] going to happen faster than we assume
[19:37] and not not slower interesting so 10 15
[19:40] years so that's also the point where you
[19:43] don't 10 to 50 years i' say 10 to
[19:44] somewhere 10 to 50 oh I thought 10 to 15
[19:48] oh okay yeah 10 to 50 and that's the
[19:51] point where Bitcoin is the dominant
[19:54] World Reserve asset there's no longer
[19:57] fear the currencies because if there
[19:59] would be a fear currency there would
[20:01] also be then nation states uh it's it's
[20:03] hard to imagine like how different are
[20:06] our lives at that point whenever this
[20:09] is really good question um I don't know
[20:11] if I gotone to that point of thinking
[20:12] about that that down at the individual
[20:14] level uh in these cases but I do think
[20:17] that um I think it's hard to envisage I
[20:20] haven't I'd like to do more thinking and
[20:22] talking with you know political
[20:23] theorists in the space but but I do get
[20:25] the sense that we are um U valh Harari
[20:29] in his book uh homod deos you know he
[20:31] talks about how the political decision
[20:34] making it it's too difficult for any one
[20:36] human or any group of humans to kind of
[20:38] take in all
[20:39] the the U input variables and come up
[20:42] with the optimal decision to kind of
[20:44] respond um and and I think we're going
[20:47] to see this emergence with you know AI
[20:50] to help enable decision-making in the
[20:52] first instance and then maybe in the
[20:54] next instance like defer decision-
[20:55] making to to AI um so so I do think that
[20:59] that will probably be some big step
[21:01] towards the future in a sense that we
[21:02] are actually in some ways as humans like
[21:06] uh relegated if you will away from the
[21:08] decision- making because we're actually
[21:09] imperfect in that more imperfect than uh
[21:12] than the AIS that we can create um but I
[21:15] do think overall life will be better for
[21:17] people I think we will be able to on
[21:20] average you know Escape wage slavery and
[21:23] uh and theft from from uh from corrupt
[21:26] centralized systems and uh and being
[21:28] able to spend our time in ways that are
[21:29] more meaningful whatever that might be
[21:31] for for different
[21:33] individuals that's interesting
[21:36] um when we come a little bit closer to
[21:39] to where we are now I feel like there's
[21:41] still a lot of career risk going on like
[21:44] right now there's still like if you're a
[21:46] politician that speaks out for Bitcoin
[21:50] um you in the US probably now it's it's
[21:54] better and better with with Trump
[21:56] pushing it and making it possible
[21:59] um we have in the German Parliament
[22:03] one uh lady that says that uh she's
[22:06] extremely full Bitcoin I know because I
[22:09] spoke with her that there are many more
[22:14] members of the German Parliament that
[22:15] are for Bitcoin but don't want to speak
[22:18] out because they're afraid to get kicked
[22:20] out of the party um the same is true for
[22:24] probably CFOs around the world that are
[22:27] in the power position to make that move
[22:30] but I like hm do I want to improve the
[22:35] uh company balance sheet or do I want to
[22:38] keep my job and that career risk is
[22:41] still there what do you think has to
[22:44] happen in order that for that career
[22:47] risk to dissolve uh in the short and
[22:50] medium term mhm yeah and I watched the
[22:53] interview you had with uh the German
[22:55] member of uh the bundist as well I
[22:57] didn't catch the whole thing but I did
[22:58] catch
[22:59] uh parts of it and I did uh yeah
[23:01] recognize the fact that that point when
[23:02] she mentioned that there's a lot of
[23:03] people who are like let's say in the
[23:04] closet Bitcoin or proponents but not
[23:06] willing to come out um but no I think if
[23:08] you look at the the analogy with the US
[23:10] right I think that's a situation that if
[23:12] we could take to an individual level as
[23:15] well right where there's they're they're
[23:17] in the position with the most to lose um
[23:20] and then I think if you look at CF but
[23:22] also potentially the most of gain and if
[23:23] you look at CFOs they're in positions of
[23:24] power they have high paying careers high
[23:27] reputations so again most to lose but
[23:30] but also you know they're they're
[23:32] steering the largest companies in the
[23:33] world with the biggest balance sheets so
[23:35] also potentially the most to gain
[23:38] um and I just think that there is it's a
[23:41] bit surprising that there still is such
[23:43] a Negative stigma um I think there it's
[23:46] it's um I think part of it is that
[23:48] there's just widespread negative myths
[23:51] uh and stigmas portray on bitcoin um so
[23:54] there needs to be work done to De deify
[23:57] debunk the the myths um I work right now
[24:01] in in the sustainability area and uh you
[24:05] know the biggest argumentation that that
[24:06] people would have you know when they
[24:07] first hear B Bitcoin they're going to
[24:09] say oh that's bad for the environment
[24:10] it's uh it's boiling the oceans it's
[24:12] it's a waste of of energy and and uh
[24:14] generating tons of emissions right so so
[24:16] I think um and it's not entirely untrue
[24:19] you know the Bitcoin network does
[24:20] consume a lot of energy and it does uh
[24:22] and does generate emissions as a result
[24:23] presently but um but it's it's it's not
[24:26] necessarily true in the sense what the
[24:28] alternatives are what's the trajectory
[24:30] of Bitcoin what else is uh the positive
[24:32] impacts that it has on the world are not
[24:34] really being communicated so so I think
[24:36] there needs to be you know
[24:38] accurate research done into that the
[24:41] aspects of the uh both positive and
[24:44] negative impacts and uh and then
[24:46] conveyed in an honest way to the public
[24:49] right um because right now it's it's
[24:51] just it's very much opinion based let's
[24:54] say uh so I think bringing a bit of
[24:55] science to to the matters will will
[24:57] hopefully help sway mind
[24:58] and then I think there's just going to
[24:59] be know just just human resistance to
[25:01] change as well psychologically I think
[25:03] people are inherently a bit scared of of
[25:05] new things um and uh and that's always
[25:09] going to be something that that that new
[25:10] things will have to overcome and then in
[25:12] instances where thing like political
[25:14] systems are um vulnerable as a result of
[25:17] this uh and and incumbent
[25:21] um uh not just power structures but in
[25:24] um wealth structures like the incumbent
[25:27] uh Financial system
[25:29] um there's always going to be people you
[25:30] know defending the against it as well
[25:33] right so um so being able to combat that
[25:36] but I think what we're seeing now at
[25:37] least in in those is is not necessarily
[25:39] this kind of like Bitcoin is destroying
[25:42] in the first instance the the incumbent
[25:44] systems but rather it's merging with it
[25:47] in some ways uh so it's not an
[25:50] antagonistic fight but actually some
[25:51] sort of symbiosis even though it's going
[25:53] to I think like ultimately become the
[25:56] dominant thing in that in that kind of
[25:58] um amalgamation if you will over the
[26:01] over the longer term so I think we're
[26:03] seeing this thing transcend from a an
[26:04] adversarial fight into something more um
[26:08] synergistic uh so I think that's that's
[26:10] maybe part of it as well I mean it's
[26:12] healthy that uh it there's a transition
[26:16] period uh it's it's like I I really like
[26:19] to use the example of a Titanic or big
[26:22] boat sinking you need the live boat to
[26:26] be ready and the other boat to be ready
[26:29] to to save the people that are on the
[26:31] boat in order for it to sink in a slow
[26:36] steady organic uh uh fashion so that you
[26:41] don't have a lot of deaths uh in that
[26:43] case or financial deaths it would be
[26:46] done so I think it's healthy to go slow
[26:52] to go
[26:53] organically uh and that's how Bitcoin
[26:56] should grow and I I think it won't grow
[26:59] like that I think it will be way faster
[27:02] than we think I think it will be
[27:05] extremely quick to adopt and extremely
[27:08] fast to to to rise to power but but
[27:12] healthier would be slow and steady over
[27:17] many many years to come uh so we have a
[27:21] nice uh transition period uh if if if
[27:25] you're on trucks or if you on like uh um
[27:29] if you're sick also um you want to get
[27:32] rid of that thing uh slowly slowly and
[27:36] don't do too much like there are many
[27:39] analogies we we can try to to to paint
[27:42] there but in general I think uh it it
[27:45] can be dangerous not for Bitcoin if that
[27:49] thing is going too fast in maybe like
[27:52] civil wars Civil unrests uh things like
[27:55] that if if Bitcoin goes
[27:58] next year to 10 million there will be a
[28:01] lot of unrest in people saying like oh
[28:03] those that's unfair that those
[28:05] bitcoiners have that wealth if it goes
[28:07] next year to
[28:09] 350k nobody will complain like it's an
[28:12] investment like it's it's it's logical
[28:14] for people um how do you see that and
[28:18] especially if you have like a timeline
[28:20] it is like 10 to 50 but like if if we
[28:23] get to the 10 years we we need really a
[28:26] like quick transition
[28:28] can it also be dangerous and and
[28:30] resulting in in civil
[28:32] unrest yeah certainly yeah I tend to
[28:34] think about it when looking at kind of
[28:36] the geopolitical order and three
[28:37] potential
[28:38] scenarios
[28:40] um and they don't really think too much
[28:43] about the time dimension in them I I but
[28:45] I think when I when I think
[28:47] about of course the speed of the change
[28:49] should would also probably be a variable
[28:52] that would lead to more unrest but when
[28:53] I I'm thinking about it more at least
[28:55] the geopolitical level about power
[28:57] structure change
[28:59] um
[29:00] so on scenario one is kind of the one I
[29:03] would call the um the coordinated uh
[29:08] harmonious uh approach
[29:10] where nation states decide okay we're
[29:13] all going to go together we're going to
[29:15] um allocate Bitcoin proportionately to
[29:18] our current you know uh gold reserves
[29:20] and wealth reserves more generally so
[29:22] that we maintain the current balance of
[29:24] power as it is today now the chance of
[29:25] that happening I think is very very
[29:27] unlikely right there's always be people
[29:28] that want to get more move faster uh get
[29:30] more wealth and power um at the expense
[29:34] of others uh and then I think also we
[29:36] just if you look at the geopolitical
[29:37] setup today there's this bipolarism or
[29:40] multipolar ISM
[29:42] emerging uh between you know the brics
[29:44] block and then the kind of NATO block
[29:46] and stuff right so to see these these
[29:48] blocks not be adversarial in terms of
[29:50] Bitcoin accumulation I think would be
[29:52] naive right but that is a scenario let's
[29:55] say If there really is this kind of
[29:56] global um coordination
[29:59] and then the second one would be one
[30:00] where there is um
[30:02] upheaval uh but in a way that is let's
[30:06] say still largely peaceful um so here
[30:09] there is a race for Bitcoin there's a
[30:11] race between uh between uh countries or
[30:14] blocks of countries um potentially also
[30:17] you know talking about you know
[30:18] corporations and Miners and how they
[30:20] play into the system and to what extent
[30:22] they'll uh Co cooperate or or be uh
[30:25] targets of of nation states um
[30:28] But ultimately uh despite there being
[30:31] changes in geopolitical power as a
[30:33] result of Bitcoin accumulation over the
[30:34] next period of time um any sort of
[30:38] unrest that emerges is contained uh so I
[30:42] think that's another scenario that we
[30:43] can we can see right and then the last
[30:45] scenario is the one where not only is
[30:47] there significant um change in the
[30:49] structure but also um conflict and
[30:52] violence and I would say that this is
[30:54] probably the most likely scenario in
[30:56] fact uh simply because I think history
[30:58] being any any sort of um Benchmark would
[31:00] tell you that when there is ma massive
[31:02] political structural changes um changes
[31:05] in the geopolitical order that that
[31:06] tends to result in in conflicts from the
[31:09] incumbents that are losing power to lash
[31:11] out and uh um and try to maintain their
[31:14] Authority through through violence as a
[31:16] last resort so in some ways I think it's
[31:18] kind of good that the the countries of
[31:19] the world that are the big military
[31:21] powers are also the ones that appear to
[31:23] be the first movers if it's true that we
[31:24] hear in the rumors about Russia and
[31:26] China uh and also the us moving forward
[31:28] so in some ways it might be good if if
[31:31] they're the ones that move fast and
[31:32] first um because they they can um if
[31:35] they can maintain their power leveled in
[31:37] the future they there's less likely
[31:39] chance they're going to um lash out
[31:42] violently but I do think ultimately
[31:44] there will be some degree of uh it's
[31:46] more likely that there will be some
[31:47] degree of of conflict um as we go
[31:49] through this transition than not I
[31:52] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[31:55] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[31:58] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[32:01] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[32:04] vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin watch
[32:07] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[32:10] go out there and show that you are a
[32:12] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[32:15] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[32:18] dropped a completely new and amazing
[32:21] Genesis edition of their watch
[32:24] collections you have the date of the
[32:26] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[32:29] and of course also the block height and
[32:32] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[32:35] the level of detail they put in in this
[32:38] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[32:40] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[32:44] down in the descriptions I love those
[32:46] watches so so much if you watch or
[32:49] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[32:52] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[32:55] and now the most important step is to
[32:57] keep keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[33:00] in a hardware wallet my personal
[33:02] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[33:04] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[33:06] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[33:08] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[33:11] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[33:15] with the code Robin at the checkout
[33:17] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[33:21] your bitbox and the next step is to
[33:24] really level up your sovereignty as an
[33:26] individual you have to have the most
[33:28] secure self- custody setup you have to
[33:31] secure your own devices you have to
[33:34] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:37] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:39] where you live you even want to have a
[33:41] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[33:44] in case something goes really really
[33:46] wrong and through all those steps the
[33:48] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[33:51] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[33:54] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[33:57] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[34:00] how you can level up your sovereignty
[34:04] that's an that's a point that I never
[34:05] thought about that it's actually good if
[34:07] if China Russia and America has early
[34:11] exposure to bitcoin so they're not
[34:13] lashing out with their military power to
[34:17] like El Salvador or other small
[34:19] countries that adopted it earlier
[34:21] because already now the USA has so many
[34:25] more Bitcoin than El salador and they
[34:28] will have so many more than El if they
[34:30] actually start buying and they have uh
[34:33] Al the whole industry is there and and
[34:36] and the mining is there and stuff like
[34:38] that so like they they have the power
[34:40] there I never thought about that point
[34:41] it's it's it's an interesting thing if
[34:44] if I can keep on going in this kind of
[34:45] vein I guess you know bring it back to
[34:47] the modern day uh countries that I know
[34:49] well are the ones I've lived in right so
[34:50] Canada and uh and Denmark Austria as
[34:53] well I don't I don't have as much
[34:54] opinion on them at the state at this
[34:55] stage though but but um
[34:58] but if I look at those two those are
[34:59] actually ones that I am somewhat
[35:00] concerned for and kind of in different
[35:02] reasons for it so I mean Canada I don't
[35:05] know if you've been following the news
[35:06] recently in Canada but the the
[35:07] government's about to collapse the
[35:09] Finance Minister just resigned earlier
[35:10] this week um it's a it's a dead duck um
[35:14] prime minister sitting right now um he
[35:18] has a you know the lowest approval
[35:20] rating in in um of his entire career but
[35:23] also uh you know of any prime minister
[35:25] who's ever been in in sitting right now
[35:27] I think it's less than
[35:28] 20% um and his party is you know
[35:31] starting to Mutiny and so forth because
[35:32] they're the most them are calling from
[35:34] him to resign point being um Canada has
[35:37] zero Bitcoin um they're in an economic
[35:40] malaise they've been financially
[35:41] mismanaging their accounts for uh you
[35:43] know worse than the rest of the world
[35:45] for the last decade um and you know they
[35:49] they are just struggling to kind of find
[35:51] their footing now to actually just have
[35:53] a functioning government um so there's a
[35:56] risk that they just are sleep at the
[35:58] wheel and miss the entire Bitcoin boat
[36:00] um over the next few years right if if
[36:02] the rest of the world starts moving and
[36:03] they're just asleep at the wheel uh I
[36:06] think the one Saving Grace is um there's
[36:08] quite a few miners in Canada there's a
[36:10] lot of energy there so there's a lot of
[36:11] cheap energy stranded energy so I think
[36:12] there's a lot of of mining which will
[36:14] happen there which will be can only be
[36:16] good for the country um but you know
[36:18] I've been I've you know people have been
[36:20] saying I don't know if you've heard this
[36:21] recently but trunk Trump has been making
[36:22] repeated jokes about how he thinks
[36:24] Canada should become the 51st state um
[36:27] and part of believes that that's
[36:28] potentially not even a joke right I
[36:30] think uh um it could be a situation
[36:33] where Canada is partly from its own
[36:35] doing partly from the US exerting
[36:38] economic Warfare on on it but could
[36:40] actually you know ultimately put in a
[36:41] position where it needs to be annexed um
[36:43] and I think it wouldn't be the first
[36:44] time that Trump has made tweets that
[36:46] were initially seen as jokes that
[36:47] ultimately became reality so so I think
[36:50] that's one you know um somewhat
[36:52] dystopian or utopian depending on what
[36:54] how you see it future uh it's a
[36:56] Liberation or a subjugation of the
[36:58] Canadian people by the us but I think
[36:59] that that could be something that
[37:00] results from as part of the whole
[37:02] Bitcoin nation state game
[37:04] theory shifting gears to Denmark um you
[37:08] know I love living here it's a super
[37:09] well-run country everything works super
[37:11] well high taxes but you you know there
[37:13] there's a high degree of trust in the
[37:16] institutions there's Le much less
[37:17] corruption the money tends to get spent
[37:19] well towards social services and
[37:22] um and it's a good place to live for for
[37:24] so many of those reasons but I think
[37:26] it's for those reasons
[37:28] that also they're the type of country
[37:29] that will probably be one of the last to
[37:31] react towards Bitcoin because they have
[37:33] no you know there's a lot more
[37:34] skepticism find with dangerous people
[37:36] it's simply because they're like um
[37:39] they're like why would we change the
[37:40] system why would we uh um impose
[37:44] something that would threaten a
[37:45] centralized um socialist system that
[37:48] from our perspective works very well
[37:50] right um so I think there's also a
[37:52] situation where uh and they can afford
[37:54] to do it also because they have just
[37:55] such a you know great bus businesses
[37:57] they have some of the world's largest
[37:59] companies uh that came out of out of
[38:01] Denmark um Europe's largest company by
[38:03] market cap by Nova Nordisk is here
[38:05] there's Lego there's MK um there's many
[38:08] others uh so so they are you know a
[38:10] wealthy industrious uh small country um
[38:14] that can afford to pay for social
[38:15] services without taking on a huge amount
[38:16] of debt so um so I think it's it's a be
[38:20] a shame that they have everything kind
[38:21] of going super well and then they're
[38:23] probably they might still be the last
[38:24] ones then because of that to move
[38:26] towards Bitcoin and embrace it
[38:28] um and might find themselves actually
[38:29] more towards the bottom of the Heap when
[38:31] the dust settles uh over time it's also
[38:34] interesting how Canada um we have the
[38:38] same thing in Austria we have the same
[38:40] thing in Germany the those Center left
[38:45] um governments are collapsing more and
[38:48] more uh how how connected is that to
[38:52] bitcoin or maybe how connected is that
[38:54] to the the thing that we described
[38:57] earlier with that political or the
[39:00] geopolitical movement towards no nation
[39:03] state and and all
[39:05] [Music]
[39:06] that uh that's a good question um I
[39:10] don't know if it's necessarily related
[39:11] directly to bitcoin at this stage I
[39:13] don't think Bitcoin has prompted it at
[39:14] this stage the the collapses but I do
[39:16] think the fact that the existing
[39:20] Paradigm um that is kind of a heart um a
[39:24] combination of both the political
[39:26] structure of officials through multi
[39:29] know party representation in combination
[39:31] with you know a mon monetarist economic
[39:34] theory um I think that combination has
[39:37] kind of reached its limit and is is is
[39:41] is realizing that it's not satisfying
[39:43] the needs in in in a context of changing
[39:45] demographics right um both in terms of
[39:48] you know like I think the primary one
[39:50] being that these developed countries
[39:51] have um decreasing native populations
[39:54] and and the the the need for iic growth
[39:58] than then relies on um either
[40:01] immigration or or thinking about a new
[40:03] paradigm right so um so I think that
[40:06] combination of factors is what we're
[40:07] starting to see play out um in terms of
[40:10] these these ultimate collapses in these
[40:11] systems now I don't know if it's
[40:12] necessarily the fact that they are by
[40:14] virtue Center left um but I do think
[40:16] there is uh with these with these
[40:18] parties even less fiscal responsibility
[40:20] than than maybe the center right or
[40:22] right parties um but I think every party
[40:25] uh this is you know irrespective of the
[40:27] party and power I think the system
[40:28] itself what that enables governments to
[40:31] um extract value from their citizen
[40:33] through um money printing through
[40:35] through uh currency devaluation um is
[40:39] the core issue right and I don't think
[40:40] it matters I think to draw an analogy
[40:42] right I think back in the monarchy days
[40:43] in the 18th century you might say okay
[40:46] is it we have a good King this this
[40:48] decade right and when he dies we have a
[40:50] bad King you know his son was a bad King
[40:51] and then we have a good King right and
[40:53] it's not the fact that it's a good or
[40:54] bad King yes that can sway a little bit
[40:56] but it's the fact that you have a
[40:57] monarchy system with a king imposing
[40:59] their own individual decrees that's the
[41:01] that's the issue right so taking that to
[41:03] the current system it's a bit more the
[41:04] system than the parties themselves in a
[41:06] way interesting yeah it also like you
[41:11] even if there are individual politicians
[41:13] that really want to do great changes
[41:15] there's a party system there's the
[41:17] Democracy system where there's maybe in
[41:20] the whole system something wrong that
[41:22] needs uh a more fundamental basis of uh
[41:25] restructuring
[41:27] then less than there are something wrong
[41:29] with the individual politicians even
[41:31] though of course
[41:32] they uh have some level of influence on
[41:37] on that but like the system itself is is
[41:40] is rigged and the incentives are are not
[41:42] good
[41:42] enough H so you want to say something to
[41:45] it yeah I was going to say I think it's
[41:46] primarily an incentive issue more so and
[41:48] and an access to certain powers issue in
[41:50] a conflict of interest and um uh than it
[41:53] is more so the uh um the first word you
[41:56] said right where it's uh
[41:58] I can't remember this but yeah I see as
[42:00] an incentives issue rather than
[42:01] nefarious intentions we'll put it that
[42:03] way oh yeah absolutely yeah um you
[42:05] brought in AI before and it's super
[42:07] interesting what role in that transition
[42:11] AI can play and how this will impact uh
[42:15] Humanity as we also see Bitcoin as one
[42:19] of the big things is going on but AI is
[42:21] also a really big thing and I think they
[42:22] are complimenting each other yeah no I
[42:25] think it's a really interesting topic I
[42:28] I might BR a different view to this than
[42:29] than others because I I I don't I
[42:31] haven't done too much thinking about you
[42:32] know the the here and now and you know I
[42:34] think there is something happening in
[42:35] terms of the the compute and compute
[42:38] becoming the common uh currency if you
[42:40] will uh that both BL Bitcoin and um and
[42:44] AI are reliant on right and um and
[42:46] becoming something of an oil for the
[42:48] Futures in some ways but but I think the
[42:50] view I'm going to take is something
[42:51] that's like really far out and deep out
[42:53] but like um I have this kind of
[42:54] philosophical perspective about you know
[42:56] the of humanity as such um and I think
[43:00] to put it in a bit of a nutshell um I
[43:02] don't really see life as having a a
[43:06] defined you know point in um at which
[43:09] life began um I think the this life
[43:13] force is sort of more of a
[43:15] Continuum so in some ways you know I
[43:17] think we we like to say uh yeah at some
[43:20] point we say there's these cells these U
[43:22] these chemical processes that have RNA
[43:24] or DNA and these things are alive but
[43:26] the things they came from the uh the
[43:28] molecules that pre pred predestined them
[43:31] the lower level of complexity was not
[43:32] alive right uh I think if you zoom out
[43:35] it's all kind of one Continuum and even
[43:38] there's some degree of Life Force within
[43:39] the totally inanimate uh rocks and uh
[43:43] hydrogen molecules and water right from
[43:44] which we came right and then to kind of
[43:46] play that
[43:47] forward um you know we're not an
[43:51] endpoint Humanity we are a step in that
[43:54] Continuum but we're at the Forefront
[43:57] right now and we are kind of birthing at
[44:00] this stage the
[44:01] next stage of Life as we as we know it
[44:05] right um and it will be so it's not
[44:07] something adversarial to us it is our
[44:09] Offspring in a way right in a in in in
[44:11] that kind of like life force continuum
[44:13] Dimension right um so you know with that
[44:17] perspective in mind I think there's also
[44:19] maybe one other dimension like I kind of
[44:20] bring through is if you were to kind of
[44:21] zoom out on you know human population on
[44:24] the globe um over the last 50,000 years
[44:27] it would look pretty much like a
[44:28] straight line horizontal and then a
[44:30] straight line vertical and already we're
[44:32] seeing indications that a lot of people
[44:34] forecasting population decline um not a
[44:37] longer population growth um I think our
[44:40] population growth rate began decreasing
[44:42] about 20 years ago um and that's only
[44:45] going to continue to accelerate and so
[44:47] what this could look like if you were to
[44:49] zoom forward another 50,000 years and
[44:52] then look at the whole 100,000 years of
[44:54] humanity it might just look like a spike
[44:58] and during that spike is where all this
[44:59] action has happened in terms of you know
[45:01] us developing this all this
[45:03] technological industrial revolution
[45:05] technology internet communications um uh
[45:09] AI ultimately that then spawns out
[45:12] during that Spike uh and then Humanity
[45:14] maybe there's a
[45:16] small few of us just kind of custodians
[45:20] or janitors for for all the
[45:21] infrastructure here on Earth while while
[45:23] AI is out at you know basically at the
[45:25] Forefront at that level um evolving and
[45:28] changing at in Realms that we can't
[45:29] really fully comprehend um so to then
[45:33] tie that a little bit back to bitcoin
[45:34] right and I I've only just started doing
[45:35] my thinking in this space but like um I
[45:39] don't necessarily see Bitcoin as
[45:41] necessarily being a human only um
[45:45] monetary system um there might be the
[45:48] need
[45:49] for uh the AIS themselves to still have
[45:53] at their core this need to exchange
[45:56] value amongst themselves there's still a
[45:58] finite amount of energy that they're
[45:59] drawing upon um and and still decisions
[46:02] that have to be made whether to do this
[46:04] or that whether to calculate this or
[46:05] that um and so in order to make those
[46:09] decisions uh there might still need to
[46:11] be an exchange of some sort of value uh
[46:14] between them for them to for for this AI
[46:16] system this kind of hive mind whatever
[46:18] it might look like to ultimately decide
[46:20] whatever it is doing right and so
[46:21] Bitcoin might
[46:22] still persist even if Humanity itself
[46:26] doesn't uh in some way with within the
[46:29] this AI complex uh as a as a medium of
[46:32] exchange if you will interesting it's
[46:34] also brings up the the kind of the
[46:37] question is is Bitcoin maybe um even
[46:43] Beyond human beings the final money the
[46:47] the the last form of of kind of money
[46:49] that that we use because we can modify
[46:52] it if if we need changes towards it we
[46:54] we we don't need to change the money we
[46:56] can modify the existence system now
[46:59] which is hard with something else like
[47:01] gold is is not modifiable in that
[47:05] sense yeah I think coming back to my
[47:07] view of like you know I don't I see
[47:08] Perfection as an ideal and not a Endo uh
[47:11] not a not something exists in reality so
[47:13] I think the programmability gives it a
[47:15] much longer longevity potentially
[47:17] hundreds thousands of years right but um
[47:20] but I I I could imagine that even
[47:22] Bitcoin will at some point um out be
[47:26] outlived um and and be suranta with
[47:29] something different at that stage but
[47:31] but I mean that's so far in the future
[47:33] and humans I'll definitely not be here
[47:35] and Humanity might no longer be here um
[47:37] but but I but I I don't see it I don't
[47:39] think there's ever such thing as forever
[47:40] I think everything's constantly in in uh
[47:43] in um in shift if you
[47:47] will there are some that say that uh if
[47:51] you if you're now born and you live to
[47:54] like like 70 or 80 you have a good
[47:55] chance of living forever uh because uh
[47:59] humanity is is progressing in medicine
[48:02] where you every year you live you add uh
[48:05] more years to live than than you reduce
[48:08] it um it it's kind of I I like the idea
[48:13] that humans die I like that like old
[48:16] generation gets uh out and new
[48:19] generations come on I think that's like
[48:21] a beautiful thing of progress also um
[48:25] but if that's possible and uh if humans
[48:29] live forever and we we we kind of get I
[48:31] mean they still they probably can still
[48:34] die but it's also interesting what what
[48:36] then happens because then you all of the
[48:38] sudden get really cautious with
[48:40] everything because now we have like oh
[48:42] we only live once we know like we will
[48:44] die anyways at like 70 80 90 100 years
[48:47] old something like that uh but if you
[48:49] have the potential to live another
[48:51] million years you have a lot of time
[48:55] left in your life and you don't have to
[48:57] take it fast and you have you can go
[48:59] slow uh will probably make us really
[49:02] cautious as human beings but that was
[49:04] not the fault that I wanted to go to no
[49:06] I think it's an interesting one I think
[49:07] I think from an individual perspective
[49:09] it would be I'd love to live much much
[49:11] longer right and I just feel like
[49:12] there's so much to see and do and think
[49:14] about and talk about and explore that it
[49:16] feels a bit Short change to only have
[49:18] whatever 90 or 100 years um so I think
[49:22] if I had the option to say yeah you
[49:23] could live much much longer as long as
[49:26] you wanted I think would take it um I do
[49:29] agree with you in the sense that I think
[49:30] there's something good about finiteness
[49:33] I think it's something that forces us
[49:36] to stay creative and not to aify I think
[49:39] uh if we could just live forever I don't
[49:41] think we would necessarily procreate as
[49:42] much and I think we would um yeah kind
[49:45] of stagnate probably in some ways
[49:48] um but uh I don't know if I had one more
[49:51] thought about that but um yeah there was
[49:53] something else I had but I but I lost it
[49:55] but I so I think I think that it's Neary
[49:57] for human kind of
[49:59] um uh creativity and um progress that we
[50:02] have some degree of uh time span to work
[50:05] within absolutely and people are it's
[50:09] it's so funny because I put sometimes
[50:11] titles and thumbnails uh around longer
[50:14] time Horizons when we talk about oh what
[50:17] will Bitcoin look like in 2050 and there
[50:19] are a lot of comments coming my way and
[50:21] saying like oh like what do I care about
[50:24] how Bitcoin looks in 2050 I don't even
[50:25] know if I'm a like that I I I don't care
[50:29] what will be life like in 2050 because
[50:32] then I will be like 80 years old or
[50:34] whatever uh or maybe I will already be
[50:36] that because yeah 2050 is still 25 and a
[50:41] little bit of years away from us but
[50:44] it's not that far it's it's like I'm I'm
[50:47] 26 so it's like one Robin life span to
[50:53] 2050 if you want to measure it like that
[50:56] uh um but one thing that I really want
[50:58] to get also in the podcast and and you
[51:00] posted that that topic also uh when we
[51:03] compare Bitcoin now the real estate and
[51:05] the other other things that Bitcoin
[51:07] might demonetize or is already
[51:10] demonetizing um how do you look at the
[51:12] full potential of of of of Bitcoin and
[51:16] and if you take the look at Bitcoin is
[51:18] money the full potential is always like
[51:20] human capabilities but like what what do
[51:22] you look at like how much can Bitcoin
[51:24] get from Real Estate from all the other
[51:26] markets and then from from the the
[51:29] currencies and stuff like
[51:31] that yeah I I guess it is a an end point
[51:35] where again where we get when we get
[51:36] there I I don't know exactly right um
[51:38] but I do think whatever
[51:41] these inferior forms of money that are
[51:44] currently acting as monies um have in
[51:47] terms of the the value that is that is
[51:50] utility and then the value that is um
[51:54] money being you know a store of value um
[51:58] I think all of those effectively all of
[51:59] that store of value amount will be
[52:01] sucked into Bitcoin uh and they will
[52:03] reduce down to their their utility
[52:05] values um so then it would be
[52:08] interesting I've seen some people try to
[52:09] do this analysis right I think with gold
[52:11] it's relatively easy because you it's
[52:12] fairly easy to understand what the util
[52:14] um utility value of gold is with some
[52:17] simple you know stock to flow and uh and
[52:19] DCF models assuming you know how much
[52:21] gold is in now the vaults that's another
[52:23] kind of question mark um but but with
[52:26] things like like real estate I think
[52:27] it's a bit more difficult and there's so
[52:28] many different markets and all that
[52:29] right but uh but I think as a as an
[52:31] ideal end point we will see that happen
[52:34] and I think again that's going to be
[52:35] good for for Humanity right we won't
[52:37] have to store gold and I think it'll be
[52:39] an interesting funny situation right
[52:40] because we're gonna have like this huge
[52:41] amount of gold for thousands of years
[52:42] worth of utility value just that comes
[52:45] on the market right um but then for
[52:47] houses it's going to be great because I
[52:48] think this hous of cost of living crisis
[52:49] housing crisis if people want to buy
[52:51] houses most people be able to buy them I
[52:55] I think at that point in time a lot of
[52:56] people they probably don't want to buy
[52:57] houses because they realize what a pain
[52:59] in the ass they
[53:00] are um but uh but I think it's going to
[53:03] be good because a lot of things that are
[53:04] that are um have become monetized
[53:07] probably shouldn't have become monetized
[53:08] so uh so I think it's going to be good
[53:10] and then as we all kind of know you know
[53:11] then you everybody participates in the
[53:15] productivity gains of the whole globe
[53:17] right just simply by holding the
[53:18] currency that they earn in right so so I
[53:21] think we're going to see um that people
[53:23] are feeling that they're in a more fair
[53:25] system and and uh and being able to um
[53:29] not necessarily get into debt slavery uh
[53:32] if they don't want to um and not feel
[53:34] forced into it so uh and I feel like
[53:36] they're on this treadmill for uh always
[53:38] keeping up with with um with inflation
[53:40] and so forth Fiat makes you desperate
[53:43] that that that's that's for sure and one
[53:45] thing that you just mentioned with gold
[53:47] uh I I imagine if gold really gets
[53:51] demonetized heavily by Bitcoin in a in a
[53:55] rapid fashion we have all that goal
[53:57] sitting around that people really want
[53:59] to sell uh and this will put a lot of
[54:03] pressure on the gold price measured in
[54:06] Bitcoin uh uh on there which might be
[54:11] the result of we stop digging for gold
[54:14] to a certain extent or like heavily
[54:17] limit that because now we have all the
[54:19] gold in ecomic incentives for it right I
[54:21] mean we will have thousands of years of
[54:23] of inventory on hold on hold right
[54:24] people will probably be trying to give
[54:25] it away I think at a certain point right
[54:27] it's absolutely yeah you can just like
[54:30] give it away and then you can use it for
[54:32] smartphones and stuff like that where
[54:33] gold is actually in as an industrial use
[54:36] case uh and it already has and it will
[54:39] be great to to use that gold for is also
[54:42] an
[54:42] interesting uh environmental uh argument
[54:46] if if we don't use gold anymore for
[54:49] money uh it's demonetized we can use the
[54:52] gold uh to put it in our smartphones and
[54:55] we don't we stop can stop digging for it
[54:58] and that's the big pollution thing yeah
[55:00] and I mean I haven't I haven't looked at
[55:01] this number something just kind of came
[55:03] to me but from what I understand gold is
[55:04] even a better conductor than copper um
[55:07] or aluminum or silver right so
[55:09] potentially it's so cheap that we could
[55:11] actually you know use it as a as a
[55:13] better conductor than than other things
[55:15] that we're currently using and maybe
[55:16] that will drive productivity and
[55:18] efficiencies in our electrical grids and
[55:20] so forth so so it could also have those
[55:21] kind of ramifications on our on our
[55:23] Energy System and positive environmental
[55:25] implications uh thereafter as well
[55:28] absolutely and the positive
[55:29] environmental uh impacts of Bitcoin is
[55:33] amazing to look at like I I I really
[55:35] love to speak with people in in Bitcoin
[55:38] energy Orit in Bitcoin mining uh
[55:41] segments where I'm like wow like you can
[55:43] do a lot with reusing heat and lowering
[55:46] the electricity bill for everyone while
[55:50] using power that you would have used
[55:52] anyways and heating a home like those
[55:55] are really interesting Concepts uh where
[55:58] we like maybe we have a Bitcoin minor in
[56:00] every household because it's just the
[56:02] most efficient way uh to get to get the
[56:06] cheapest electricity for for everyone I
[56:09] I I really look forward to to to what
[56:13] human engineering can do with Bitcoin
[56:16] and Bitcoin mining and can bring the
[56:18] world forward without even the money
[56:21] part of it the money part is just like a
[56:23] really great benefit towards that but
[56:26] what Bitcoin mining can do for
[56:27] electricity costs and the environment it
[56:29] it will be really really great and that
[56:31] that shift from narrative from Bitcoin
[56:34] mining is bad for the environment and
[56:36] it's can just consumes energy do we
[56:38] actually need it that that that's a huge
[56:41] one and I think we get there yeah and
[56:44] it's interesting I think in hindsight
[56:45] when we we look back on this you know
[56:47] it's going to be hilarious to see how
[56:48] all of these things that were seen as
[56:51] negatives ultimately we're the exact
[56:53] opposite in hindsight right I think uh
[56:55] you know um Bitcoin is a scam or a Ponzi
[56:58] scheme no it's the current system that
[56:59] it's replacing that's actually that um
[57:01] same thing with this environmental
[57:02] impact narrative so it's I think it's an
[57:04] interesting thing with with Bitcoin and
[57:06] I I I think it's also been probably
[57:07] similar with again revolutions
[57:08] technological revolutions that happened
[57:10] in the past right there's all these
[57:11] myths that are actually more um focused
[57:14] on the existing system rather than than
[57:16] than the technology that's replacing it
[57:19] I have one interesting thing uh that
[57:21] might be interesting to share here with
[57:25] everyone
[57:26] that is shining a light maybe what's
[57:29] happening right now with Bitcoin and
[57:31] what could happen also uh long term with
[57:34] Bitcoin let's see if I can pull it off
[57:38] yes uh you can see my screen here and
[57:41] that's the anti electricity
[57:44] propaganda uh and and and there's a lot
[57:46] of that like we we more recently because
[57:49] those those things are like uh old but
[57:53] there's more reason with the internet we
[57:55] had the same
[57:56] uh where a lot of fat came along the
[58:00] internet like oh internet is S a f and
[58:02] stuff like that electric cars uh cars in
[58:05] general uh electricity all those big
[58:09] Innovations had in the beginning a huge
[58:13] blowback and then all of a sudden it
[58:16] came uh anyways and now we cannot live
[58:20] without electricity now we cannot live
[58:22] without internet and at some point we
[58:24] cannot live or we cannot think about
[58:26] about living without Bitcoin it be like
[58:28] what your country didn't adopt Bitcoin I
[58:30] mean there are already there are parts
[58:33] of the world that don't have electricity
[58:34] that don't have internet uh and we will
[58:37] look at those countries the same way we
[58:39] will look at those countries that then
[58:41] don't have have Bitcoin and that that's
[58:44] kind of an that's kind of how I see the
[58:47] the future devolving with with Bitcoin I
[58:50] I think that's totally consistent right
[58:51] and I think uh you
[58:54] know in the thing the the entities you
[58:57] know whether it's countries or or
[58:59] companies or people that want to resist
[59:00] I mean they can only resist for so long
[59:02] until a certain point they have to you
[59:04] know when the whole rest of society
[59:06] moves forward
[59:08] um they would have to isolate themselves
[59:11] uh to be able to really um you know
[59:12] entrench like North Korea or something
[59:14] to really shelter yourself from Bitcoin
[59:16] because of the network effects right um
[59:20] and
[59:21] uh yeah getting a bit tired so I'm
[59:24] losing my TR of thought here um but no I
[59:27] was going to say the the resistance and
[59:29] I think also you know ultimately
[59:31] resistance is futile so to speak in some
[59:33] ways because um it's inevitable right
[59:35] when there's just I think this is just
[59:36] technological waves and and shifts and
[59:39] paradigms um they they people will you
[59:43] can't force people not to use something
[59:45] that's better than the the alternative
[59:47] right
[59:48] um
[59:50] naturally yeah people naturally credit
[59:53] credited uh go go towards those te
[59:56] technology versus the like even if you
[59:59] forbid it even if you ban it like people
[60:02] will go towards that technology and
[60:04] really want to have them like look at
[60:06] North Korea like it's it's super obvious
[60:09] uh that you really want to have
[60:11] Innovation you really want to have those
[60:13] things in your life yeah really cool um
[60:15] I have one question as you know that I
[60:18] asked each and every one of my guests
[60:19] and this is the question of what can we
[60:21] learn from you besides Bitcoin
[60:23] interesting question I spent so much of
[60:24] my time in the last you know a little
[60:27] while like just spending all my free
[60:28] time thinking about Bitcoin and like uh
[60:30] watching content and stuff but uh but no
[60:32] I think um something I do kind of for
[60:34] fun um that uh I know a little bit about
[60:37] is is traveling by bicycle so i' I've
[60:40] done kind of longdistance touring um
[60:44] independently on a bike across different
[60:46] parts of North America I went across the
[60:49] US uh back when I finished my my
[60:51] undergraduate degree um I've done long
[60:54] tours here in Europe um and it's just a
[60:56] fantastic way to travel and I have lots
[60:58] of tips and uh and tricks and and uh and
[61:00] highly encourage people if they're
[61:02] they're ever considering a novel and
[61:04] lowcost way to travel uh and see the
[61:06] world a bit slower than through a train
[61:08] or a car or a plane is is to get on a
[61:10] bike um and and uh and just go and see
[61:13] the world that way now we that's amazing
[61:16] by the way uh that that's really good a
[61:18] good way to to travel it's interesting
[61:20] it's also a Denmark way to travel I feel
[61:23] like yeah I part part of what drew me
[61:25] into Mark is the the bike culture I I
[61:27] have like five bikes here or something
[61:29] so it's a you know different bike for
[61:30] different purposes so oh really five
[61:33] different ones like how many purposes
[61:35] are there yeah well two of them are
[61:37] actually the exact same purpose I just
[61:38] uh just my commuting bikes I've I uh I
[61:41] had one in Vienna and one in Copenhagen
[61:43] and then when I moved back to Copenhagen
[61:44] I took my one from Vienna so but the
[61:47] other ones there's a carbon bike there's
[61:50] an aluminum bike there's the Touring
[61:52] bike um mountain bike so yeah there's
[61:55] different
[61:56] purposes really cool uh that's that's
[61:59] great I I have currently zero bikes
[62:05] okay but I I like biking when I was back
[62:08] in Munich I had an electric M bike
[62:11] actually and it this was really fun uh
[62:14] because it was just the fastest way to
[62:15] get to the office my office was with the
[62:18] public transport 15 16 17 minutes away
[62:22] uh with car mostly even more because
[62:26] there was traffic it was like in the
[62:28] middle of the city uh and parking spaces
[62:31] were really limited and the bike was the
[62:34] only thing that got me there in like 12
[62:36] minutes especially if you it was all
[62:38] flat and after electric bike you just
[62:41] like really race through the city uh in
[62:44] in a rapid time uh and you can take all
[62:47] those small shortcuts you get a really
[62:49] direct uh way of it no stops and I I I
[62:53] loved it like every day even in Vos like
[62:56] I had like one or two weeks where I uh
[63:00] stopped doing that like in January I
[63:02] think it was uh but almost completely
[63:06] through the winter I I threw I was
[63:08] traveling with the bike in Germany so
[63:11] that that was a great experience yeah
[63:13] there's something liberating about you
[63:14] know traveling out in the you know fresh
[63:17] air in the morning even if it's cold and
[63:19] uh and also not having you know feeling
[63:20] like you're stuck in traffic waiting for
[63:22] people if the Metro shuts down there's
[63:25] lots of people and crowded you know you
[63:26] feel a bit like contained but there's
[63:27] something you know very you know
[63:29] liberating and free about being on a
[63:30] bike I find I do have one one electric
[63:33] bike that I got for um I have a
[63:34] two-year-old son and we have these uh
[63:37] Copenhagen is kind of famous for these
[63:39] Christiania bikes with the box in the
[63:41] front that you can kind of put uh
[63:44] children or uh or groceries whatever
[63:46] right um but that's an electric a
[63:48] battery powered electric bike and uh I'm
[63:50] still kind of getting used to the whole
[63:51] electric bike thing I it's kind of a new
[63:53] thing for me but but it's fun yeah my
[63:56] main thought was I don't want to sweat
[63:58] in the
[63:59] office yes that's that's polite of you
[64:02] that's respectful for your I was like uh
[64:05] I I want to go there and don't sweat uh
[64:08] so electric bike is perfect for that
[64:10] it's just like and it was H how how was
[64:14] it called I forgot the name but it was a
[64:16] popular brand even um oh like
[64:22] electric bike maybe I can find it uh
[64:28] popular let's see how it comes
[64:31] up uh no no no no no it was it has like
[64:35] an app and
[64:36] everything uh and was really nice to
[64:39] drive to be honest I liked it a lot uh
[64:43] but something with
[64:45] an let me see maybe I can find it
[64:49] quickly uh
[64:52] and
[64:53] um no I don't find it
[64:56] no way out of finding it I I will I will
[65:00] send it to you later if I find it but uh
[65:03] it was a really good one it had an app
[65:05] uh if you can there was like an illegal
[65:08] app that you can buy for like eight and
[65:11] then it was driving instead of 25
[65:15] kilometers per hours it was driving
[65:17] 35 uh and that was amazing it was yeah
[65:20] they took off the governor and Let It Go
[65:22] like full potential just like letting it
[65:24] throw uh uh it did train the battery a
[65:27] lot but I didn't care for that because I
[65:30] could charge it in the office and at
[65:32] home uh and it probably like got me
[65:35] through like two three days anyways and
[65:39] uh it was so much faster it was just
[65:41] really nice like in in the piking lanes
[65:43] I was always the fastest one love it
[65:46] love
[65:47] it uh but yeah really cool thank you so
[65:49] much uh we we still have the end routine
[65:51] of the podcast uh where the previous
[65:54] guest is asking a question for the next
[65:55] guest guest without knowing who the next
[65:57] guest actually is and the question for
[65:59] you is how can a regular ple play a
[66:03] significant role in Orange pilling the
[66:05] world
[66:07] H good question uh I guess I'm one of
[66:10] those everyday
[66:12] plebs so um I I guess from my own
[66:15] experience you know I haven't changed
[66:17] the world yet I guess but
[66:20] um uh I think not being afraid to you
[66:24] know not just absorb cont
[66:26] but uh think about your own ideas write
[66:30] them down uh and then communicate them
[66:32] with others and sharpen them I think
[66:33] it's about just entering you know
[66:35] sincere dialogues with other uh people
[66:38] who want to you know discuss these
[66:39] issues whether they agree with you or
[66:40] not and um and uh get your voice heard
[66:44] uh one way or another um whether it's
[66:46] just with your neighbor or your friends
[66:47] or or on a to a broader audience I think
[66:50] that's uh that's the you know that's the
[66:52] change that that manifests even if it's
[66:54] not um the same change that a super
[66:57] influential person has I think it still
[66:58] is uh is is um important and I think
[67:01] that's how you know the orange pilling
[67:03] is spreading right it's happening not
[67:05] only through the big communicators like
[67:06] the NAT Brunell and and the Michael
[67:08] Sailors but it's also happening on a on
[67:10] a individual onetoone basis with um with
[67:13] individuals like us so super truly
[67:15] Grassroots movement and I like that
[67:18] message a lot really cool Ted uh before
[67:20] I let you go where can people find you
[67:22] ask your questions and reach out to you
[67:24] so I've just started getting active on
[67:26] uh on X so uh my handle is uh rxin 84 uh
[67:31] on X so I will uh I guess I'll give you
[67:33] the the handle you can put it to the
[67:35] comments below I will uh I will put it
[67:38] in the in the description uh and put it
[67:41] there and people can directly find it so
[67:43] thank you so much Ted for for being on
[67:45] the show also thank you so much for
[67:46] everyone that's watching and listening
[67:48] for joining us today as always I'll be
