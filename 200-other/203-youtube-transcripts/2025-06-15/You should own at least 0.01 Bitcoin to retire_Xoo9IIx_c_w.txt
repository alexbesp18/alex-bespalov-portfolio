[00:00] I think in 15 years Fiat will be dead in
[00:02] a 10year frame if you have one Bitcoin
[00:04] you can retire in a 15E frame you have
[00:06] half a Bitcoin you can retire in a
[00:08] 20-year frame if you have at least 1
[00:10] million satoshis you can't retire they
[00:12] are so entrenched into stealing the
[00:15] national treasury through inflation
[00:18] through their salaries through their
[00:19] concessions through their business deals
[00:21] in real estate and gold and some of
[00:24] assets that they don't have time to look
[00:26] in the cancer that they have already
[00:28] within society which is B Bitcoin is a
[00:30] cancer Bitcoin is a virus that is going
[00:32] to kill everything that is broken stage
[00:34] will be replaced by code and money will
[00:37] be ruled by Bitcoin on C if Russia had
[00:40] their assets not in treasury bonds 600
[00:43] billion but if they had it in Bitcoin
[00:45] the us could have not done anything
[00:47] about it nothing there is about 15
[00:49] million Bitcoin in the hands of us and
[00:51] when I mean us the bitcoiners which know
[00:54] its value and we have not released it
[00:56] yet because we believe humanity is not
[00:58] ready to be at Peace With Money that
[01:01] cannot be manipulated it's going to take
[01:03] some time we we have to let this clown
[01:05] War take the pendulum to the extreme you
[01:08] as a human being want exactly the same
[01:10] stuff as I want you want to be wealthy
[01:12] you want to be healthy you want to have
[01:14] a family you have to have a roof over
[01:16] your head and you want to live in peace
[01:17] but politicians don't give us that they
[01:19] give us
[01:21] [Music]
[01:24] uncertainty um how did you find your way
[01:26] in Bitcoin and how uh do you think
[01:29] everyone should find the way and why
[01:31] should everyone find the way in in
[01:32] Bitcoin like like maybe in a starter
[01:36] question I've been looking for Bitcoin
[01:40] since I was an early child seeing my
[01:44] father who was um
[01:46] an how you say an industrialist he owned
[01:50] several companies which his partners and
[01:53] I remember when the tax time came uh it
[01:57] was a very stressful time they had to
[01:59] guide a lot of paperwork they had to
[02:01] have a lot of meetings I mean it was it
[02:03] was very stressful time it was hard to
[02:06] um share time with my father during
[02:08] those times because we owned assets
[02:11] significant amount of assets at the time
[02:13] and and companies and they meant that
[02:17] the accountably they had to be all
[02:18] organized so I since at a very early age
[02:21] I found that the interaction with the
[02:23] state is quite aggressive if you make a
[02:27] mistake on your tax reports they want to
[02:30] come and search you and then make your
[02:31] life impossible so I would say why are
[02:34] we paying taxes I mean did I just pay
[02:36] for that toy then I just pay for that
[02:39] house and we're still paying taxes on it
[02:41] so I always say is there a way to just
[02:44] separate State and the money that I
[02:46] earned so they don't bother me and so I
[02:49] was always looking for Bitcoin so with
[02:52] that in mind in the back of my hand
[02:54] obviously Bitcoin only appeared in 2009
[02:57] I never heard about it until during a a
[03:01] corporate business trip meeting in in
[03:04] the United States I um left the three
[03:08] days of corporate meetings which went
[03:10] really like [ __ ] because I ended up
[03:11] being fired like three months later and
[03:15] uh I got into an nearly flight from
[03:18] Chicago to Miami um around 5:30 in the
[03:22] morning and because at that time the
[03:25] corporate policies allow you to travel
[03:27] in business class I chose my road and I
[03:30] seen by the aisle and and I called my
[03:32] father 6:00 in the morning just to let
[03:34] him know that I was flying back to to my
[03:37] current tax Farm resident residents and
[03:42] then uh that the meetings were like [ __ ]
[03:44] we started talking it was early in the
[03:46] morning 5 till 6 and suddenly somebody
[03:49] came to the chair so I I uncross my legs
[03:53] and moved back and I had my phone in
[03:55] between the two chairs and you had the
[03:58] window so the guy the person was going
[04:00] to come in he came in and he hang out my
[04:03] phone and then he turned around and sit
[04:06] and then he said to me have you heard
[04:09] about Bitcoin and dude is it's 5:58 in
[04:13] the morning I I turn around I said to
[04:16] that person uh I was talking to my
[04:18] father and he said again with a Crazy
[04:21] Eyes rounded crazy eyes with big uh how
[04:24] do you say um when when you don't sleep
[04:27] how do you call that I have the blue
[04:30] eyes I don't know how to call it I'm
[04:32] doep much they get this type of blue or
[04:35] dark dark you know what I mean okay so I
[04:39] I I said again to myself um I didn't say
[04:42] anything I just thought what the [ __ ] I
[04:44] got a five five five hour and a half
[04:47] flight with a fellow that I don't know
[04:49] he just sit down to hang up my phone and
[04:52] he's asking me about
[04:54] bigcoin and then I I I thought to myself
[04:57] what the [ __ ] is going on and then he
[04:58] said again for the third time with
[05:00] bigger eyes and crazier eyes and he said
[05:03] to me have you heard about Bitcoin and I
[05:06] said to myself [ __ ] I got five hours and
[05:08] a half I'm not going to argue with this
[05:10] guy I'm sitting here I want to sit here
[05:12] so I said to my I said to him uh no tell
[05:14] me so he said give me your phone and
[05:17] I'll download an application I'll give
[05:19] you some I'll show you how it works and
[05:21] I said to myself no crap I don't know I
[05:23] mean I don't know what type of
[05:24] application he wants to download and
[05:26] then he will be tracking me or whatever
[05:29] so I was quite paranoic so I said to him
[05:32] no no just tell me and I'll take a note
[05:34] so I pull out my notepad and I I started
[05:36] and we spoke during five hour five and a
[05:38] half hours on the whole flight about
[05:41] Bitcoin and he's telling me all this
[05:43] stuff and where to get it and who to
[05:45] speak with and what it does and how is
[05:48] it so powerful and protected so I said
[05:51] to him but during our conversation I
[05:54] said but how do you know so much about
[05:56] it he said well I I'm just coming back
[05:58] from Switzerland
[06:00] and of course I'm making I made a stop
[06:03] in in New York uh on both ends for
[06:06] meetings with the private banking sector
[06:09] explaining Bitcoin and I said okay and
[06:12] then so what do you do no now I'm flying
[06:14] to wois I was going to another city in
[06:17] Latin America also that's why we were
[06:19] both together in the same flight to
[06:21] Miami um but uh but that's pretty much
[06:24] what I do said okay fine that's good
[06:27] very pleased to meet you we say goodbye
[06:29] to each
[06:30] and I started walking down the aisle to
[06:32] my to my gate for the connection and of
[06:34] course he went away to his connection
[06:36] bues so I check him out he gave me the
[06:39] addresses I check him out and I was
[06:41] during five five hours and a half on a
[06:45] personal conference and I would I would
[06:48] call a brutal induction to the Bitcoin
[06:51] Rabbit Hole by Mr Andreas antonoplos and
[06:55] and under that process I said I check
[06:58] him out I mean he got
[07:00] 250,000 followers at that time in
[07:02] Twitter say what the heck I spoke with
[07:04] and I started investigating Bitcoin from
[07:06] that day
[07:08] on uh within seven days I started
[07:12] purchasing
[07:14] Bitcoin I would say about $320
[07:18] average and I uh continue buying Bitcoin
[07:23] until I got to the point where I say
[07:26] okay I got enough here I want to try the
[07:29] shitcoins because we all do shitcoins at
[07:32] the beginning and and I chose about
[07:35] seven shitcoins I bought about the same
[07:37] quantity I had with Bitcoin and then I
[07:39] started regressively with the same
[07:42] process I did with Bitcoin but Bitcoin I
[07:44] bought it from the beginning and then
[07:45] study it looking for holes and the other
[07:49] shons I started looking for holes and
[07:51] the shikun I I found the holes half an
[07:54] hour five minutes I mean they were
[07:56] stupid companies selling the IDE ideal
[08:00] of what Bitcoin can provide on terms and
[08:04] conditions that were not not even not
[08:06] even viable but completely irrelevant
[08:09] and with have big gaps in regards of
[08:12] privacy or big gaps in regards of
[08:15] reliability so I I I sell sold them back
[08:19] and then again bought the Bitcoin that I
[08:21] bought so I got back to my stack and I
[08:24] kept on studying it obsessively I
[08:27] Remember by the end of 2016 I was with a
[08:30] whole bunch of family members and I just
[08:32] sit them around and said I got to tell
[08:34] you about something and I was just
[08:36] completely mer on the topic completely
[08:40] immersed and by that time I gave each
[08:43] about I don't know $100 worth of pcoin
[08:47] and nowadays none of them still have
[08:49] them I knew they were going to throw it
[08:50] away they were going to forget it they
[08:51] were not going to pay attention I know
[08:53] they none of them had it because they
[08:56] didn't go through that process as I did
[08:58] I mean this is why probably the most
[09:00] violent process of a Bitcoin Rabbit Hole
[09:03] induction that a human being can
[09:06] have um that was that was my entry to to
[09:10] the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole so I got pushed
[09:12] down to the bottom of the rabbit hole
[09:14] from the day one and I've been exploring
[09:18] other Alternatives and other things uh
[09:21] to to my history but sadly Andreas
[09:24] turned around and started
[09:26] investigating uh [ __ ] coins and doing
[09:29] things that of course were not nice for
[09:31] the rest of us so he he kind of distant
[09:34] himself from the community and slowly
[09:36] he's getting back but uh yeah you can
[09:39] prove that the road through the [ __ ] con
[09:42] rabbit hole is always a bad one always a
[09:44] bad one why do you think so many people
[09:47] falling for the I I call it shitcoin
[09:50] trap oh it's a simple thing is is let me
[09:53] I'm going to switch this and
[09:56] going thank
[09:57] you so the question why why so many
[10:00] people going to the shitcoin rabbit hole
[10:03] Yeah like why are so many falling for
[10:05] the for the shitcoin Trap yeah like I
[10:08] said it's easy it's easy you need
[10:11] buyers a Bitcoin is worth 60 some
[10:14] thousand us cup bock and um a Shon will
[10:19] be less than a dollar and people want to
[10:22] to experience the same process of going
[10:26] through these bull runs on a [ __ ] they
[10:28] just don't know they last half an hour
[10:30] or in Bitcoin the last years so that's
[10:32] why I think they people tend to go into
[10:35] [ __ ] yeah it's it's it's it's
[10:37] fascinating to see all all those people
[10:39] going into the [ __ ] Cs and going to the
[10:41] Alon rout and it's like ah yeah but but
[10:45] but I feel like it it's it's part of
[10:47] your Bitcoin Learning Journey like if if
[10:50] you don't experience with altcoins uh
[10:53] you probably don't know bit like you
[10:56] have to go down that role you start with
[10:58] Bitcoin you go down there Alin route and
[11:00] then you go back to to bitcoin it's like
[11:02] this this this learning curve um it's an
[11:05] interesting it's really interesting
[11:06] orange ping story being orange P Andreas
[11:10] antonoplos I love it a lot um did you
[11:13] also go ahead and then orange bued
[11:15] people that that
[11:18] aggressively yes yes in fact I I am
[11:21] specialized I mean in the accounting
[11:24] department of the bcoin corporation we
[11:26] do training specific training for the
[11:28] person to be able to efficiently Orange
[11:31] Peel people in fact I I have some notes
[11:35] Here in regards of how to fastly Orange
[11:38] Peel human
[11:40] beings so we can we can also touch that
[11:43] topic because it's it's something that
[11:45] people do I don't know juggle with it
[11:50] and sometimes is very hard and when in
[11:52] reality orange ping somebody is quite
[11:54] easy how do you do it like uh what's
[11:57] your process um first first question I
[12:00] do when when I'm orange peing somebody
[12:02] is I ask them what do they think about
[12:04] inflation and this is like logic
[12:06] programming so when people say inflation
[12:09] no I don't understand inflation you
[12:11] explain them inflation but when people
[12:14] then tell you that they hate inflation
[12:16] because the cost of living has just
[12:19] skyrocketed then you can work with that
[12:22] person a lot faster than the one that
[12:23] doesn't know inflation but either of the
[12:25] two when you explain them inflation then
[12:28] obviously they realize they've been
[12:30] taxed not once not twice but three four
[12:33] five times and with that in mind you do
[12:36] realize that there's a need to solve
[12:38] this problem of inflation and hidden
[12:40] taxes and taxes without
[12:42] representation but keep Bitcoin
[12:45] automatically when you explain them that
[12:47] the structure of Finance systems that
[12:50] we're living through nowadays people
[12:51] realize it's got to be something
[12:54] different and when you say okay
[12:56] something different then the first thing
[12:58] that comes to mind is always go for gold
[13:01] but gold is a [ __ ] coin because
[13:03] transporting gold is a paining the butt
[13:07] additionally transporting gold requires
[13:09] that if you do it in large amounts your
[13:11] risk is very high if it's not officially
[13:14] registered and in this if it's
[13:15] officially registered you still run a a
[13:18] lot of risk so it's a capture
[13:21] asset I we did I let's say my a group of
[13:26] investors that I work with we did have
[13:28] gold
[13:29] what a significant amount of gold and
[13:31] eventually when a situation happened
[13:33] within one of these tax Farms that I
[13:35] mentioned to you IID in uh there was a
[13:39] directly direct State attack on us when
[13:43] this happened we realize the value of
[13:46] gold is minimal it's just a shiny
[13:49] freaking rock it is that it's got some
[13:52] value for industrial applications but in
[13:54] reality there is no benefit other than
[13:56] jeul in some industrial applications
[13:58] some so it's highly overrated on top of
[14:02] that if you look at gold gold it has a
[14:05] ridiculous tax on the
[14:08] environment if these people that work
[14:11] with green peas and with with Greta and
[14:14] everybody that is so involved in the
[14:16] environment uh concern if they were
[14:19] smart they will go directly against
[14:22] mineral mining especially for luxury
[14:25] goods in the case of gold because my
[14:29] my personal profession involves me into
[14:32] physical mining I do Supply equipment to
[14:36] the largest mining producers in the in
[14:38] the world through my my entities and to
[14:41] do that I do choose my customers clearly
[14:45] I don't like um miners that work in in
[14:48] the jungle or I don't like miners that
[14:51] work in areas where there's a lot of
[14:53] environmental
[14:55] effects so I work with miners that work
[14:57] in the desert that work in isolated
[14:59] areas that there is no significant
[15:02] environmental effect by these mining
[15:05] operations so going back to the point of
[15:08] of orange peing instead of turnning
[15:11] showing the people the exit and the
[15:13] solution show people the problem they
[15:16] will look for the solution they will ask
[15:19] you for the solution and if you know it
[15:20] then you explain them Bitcoin it's a
[15:22] protocol is
[15:24] decentralized uh one thing that is
[15:26] important to mention Robin is that
[15:30] cryptocurrencies do exist since a long
[15:32] time ago in fact if you've been doing
[15:35] your banking through the internet you've
[15:37] probably been doing cryptocurrency
[15:39] centralized cryptocurrency Fiat for the
[15:42] past 30 25 years so once you explain
[15:46] that to to a person who doesn't know
[15:48] about Bitcoin go okay I know I have
[15:50] cryptocurrency in my own
[15:52] bank what other kinds of cryptocurrency
[15:54] are well there are crypto non-regulated
[15:57] cryptocurrencies which are the shic
[15:59] these are coins non-regulated and then
[16:02] of course unregulated cryptocurrencies
[16:05] which is our exit of
[16:10] Bitcoin sorry I had problems with my
[16:12] microphone I also like it that uh once
[16:16] you once some because most people don't
[16:18] understand that we have a problem uh
[16:20] like a lot of people are still speak and
[16:22] they're like yeah inflation a little bit
[16:24] inflation is good for the uh economy
[16:27] it's not that bad and like inflation is
[16:30] theft like they they're stealing
[16:32] purchasing power from you like why are
[16:35] you saying we need that why do we need
[16:37] theft for the economy it's not it's not
[16:40] required it's absolutely not required
[16:42] and once you realize let's say you make
[16:44] some savings you make some savings and
[16:47] you say Okay I want I want to work more
[16:49] with this money I I made it already you
[16:52] start going into fix return assets and
[16:55] you realize it's just it's just a scam
[16:58] because this state will take 15 20 30%
[17:01] of that profit they didn't do
[17:05] anything and then you start I mean if
[17:08] people don't realize they being roughed
[17:10] every day is they're just too not too
[17:13] stupid to to be able to understand
[17:16] Bitcoin and as I said few days ago and
[17:19] as I said on a frequent basis Bitcoin is
[17:22] not for the stupid nor for the lazy why
[17:25] why do you you said just said that you
[17:27] also mind Bitcoin in different
[17:29] uh why did you go in in mining
[17:32] Bitcoin I well I I do work on both
[17:36] mining events eventually initially I
[17:38] work with with the physical Bitcoin
[17:40] mining I was the
[17:43] first Miner and the first
[17:46] node using only solar energy in 2016 I
[17:51] mean I embedded myself into the Bitcoin
[17:53] Network as deep as possible from the
[17:56] get-go so one month later I was already
[17:59] ordering my my S9 L3 Miner and and start
[18:05] doing the testing and from then and on I
[18:07] went into I moved into the atakama
[18:09] desert and I lived there for two years
[18:11] and I acquired the mining equipment and
[18:14] I like I said I had a node I had a
[18:17] Bitcoin mining over there and I was
[18:19] focused in using solar energy at the
[18:22] time so I took those two years which
[18:24] were very educative for me and very
[18:27] profitable to me I have to say even
[18:29] though I didn't spend any money I
[18:30] invested my money properly into Bitcoin
[18:33] and separated state from my money I love
[18:36] it a lot you also brought brought up uh
[18:39] taxes uh before we uh when when you uh
[18:42] when you started the uh and the
[18:45] explaining Bitcoin um and we know that
[18:48] inflation is kind of a tax that's always
[18:51] there uh and this is a tax that
[18:53] definitely does not make sense it steals
[18:55] from people without representation um do
[18:58] you think that taxes in general uh make
[19:00] makes sense or is it like we should we
[19:02] should cut taxes and we should only pay
[19:04] for actual Services is like a service
[19:06] based government better I'm going to go
[19:10] further in time but I'm going to choose
[19:11] a phrase to tell you about it because
[19:14] this a specifically directed to it and
[19:18] uh if you bear with me because I really
[19:22] did take some not here to share with you
[19:24] through the through today I would say
[19:27] that uh the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole allows
[19:30] you to travel in time close future and
[19:33] further future into time and by doing
[19:36] that you gain inner peace that inner
[19:40] peace allow bitcoiners to have a clear
[19:43] set of Mind of principles of
[19:48] goals and of course the relation with
[19:51] the service
[19:52] providers I do believe that it within 10
[19:57] years we will start seeing certain
[20:01] states that are collapsing through their
[20:04] corrupt
[20:05] infrastructure being replaced by code
[20:09] the I mean within Bitcoin we can talk
[20:12] about past present and future and if you
[20:16] if you talk about past with Bitcoin you
[20:19] have to remember that we used to have
[20:21] religion the state and money
[20:25] together and while I was very early on
[20:28] my age was born in a tax farm that has
[20:30] been always at War I mean always there
[20:34] there was always some news about
[20:37] somebody somebody putting a bomb and
[20:39] blowing up a bridge and killing some
[20:40] people and then putting on a car bomb
[20:42] elsewhere so on so for and uh there were
[20:46] always these religious leaders that
[20:48] would get involved within the terrorist
[20:50] and the state to make this peace
[20:52] agreements which ended up just being in
[20:54] a messed up down the road with another
[20:56] attack and another killing of of people
[20:59] who had absolutely nothing to do with it
[21:02] so in the past we had the state religion
[21:06] and money together and then we separated
[21:09] religion and the state but the peace was
[21:12] false so the problem for peace was not
[21:15] religion and state who in the past did
[21:18] help for a lot of Wars but now we come
[21:21] to the point where okay the solution for
[21:23] peace is not the state with with
[21:26] religion together and with money we took
[21:29] away religion now we got the state and
[21:31] money and when you separate State and
[21:34] money that's the last leg that trembles
[21:37] state intervention in your
[21:39] life because now the only way the state
[21:42] to charge me is either through the AES
[21:44] that I own within the tax Farm or with
[21:47] the services that I purchase directly
[21:49] but I tell you that individuals that
[21:51] know about Bitcoin nowadays in countries
[21:54] that are non-democratic are very aware
[21:56] of the efficiency of Bitcoin
[21:59] you see your point of view of Bitcoin
[22:01] depends on which tax Farm you are in in
[22:05] your current tax Farm the presence of
[22:07] the state would probably say that you
[22:09] got close to 20% of of bat tax and you
[22:13] got about close to 30% of uh let's say
[22:16] assets and Rental declaration per year
[22:19] so you're looking at 50% taxing but you
[22:22] are on top of that inflation and now
[22:24] we're looking about 60 65 70% tax sttion
[22:30] how could we accept that if we don't
[22:33] have a tool we have to swallow the blue
[22:35] pill but if we have a tool we can
[22:38] swallow the orange pill and the more you
[22:41] study pitco the more you realize that it
[22:43] has less holes you see on a tday Tuesday
[22:47] 11: a.m. meetings with the CEO of the
[22:49] Bitcoin Corporation Mr Nakamoto is quite
[22:52] clear there will be no more than
[22:57] 20,999
[23:00] 99996 7 Bitcoin no
[23:03] more and we're not changing that
[23:06] [ __ ] and when you you learn that you can
[23:09] use that tool without anything other
[23:12] than you investing your time in learning
[23:14] so you cannot be lazy and you invest in
[23:17] your time and learning so you have to
[23:19] become smart implies that you gain
[23:22] freedom that's the cost of Freedom stage
[23:24] will be replaced by code and money will
[23:28] be ruled by Bitcoin
[23:31] Citadel which is another topic I want to
[23:33] bring to you to the table you remember
[23:35] an old tweet that I have pinged to my to
[23:39] my uh Twitter profile and it says that
[23:43] citadels will be run in Nakamoto for you
[23:46] to to own a citadel you at least will
[23:50] need to have one bit within the Citadel
[23:53] that Bitcoin will be spread to be paying
[23:55] for services but not in satosi
[23:58] in Nakamoto 100 million of 100 million
[24:02] of a
[24:03] Bitcoin and with that in mind that node
[24:07] that could be redistributed to that
[24:09] Citadel will protect that no other money
[24:13] enters within that CIT so this will be
[24:16] closed notes that will interact between
[24:19] the lining level
[24:21] three let's say notes that I within its
[24:25] Network that's how we be in probably 25
[24:29] 30 Years thank you you already made it
[24:31] halfway through the video and I'm really
[24:33] really grateful to have you here two
[24:35] things make this channel possible you as
[24:38] a watcher and listener who keep
[24:40] supporting this Channel and another one
[24:42] is all the Bitcoin brands that I partner
[24:45] up with like 21 Bitcoin who support me
[24:47] from the very start and where I
[24:49] personally buy my Bitcoin from with code
[24:51] Robin you even get a discount when you
[24:53] buy Bitcoin with them and now also
[24:56] bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[24:58] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[25:01] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[25:04] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[25:06] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[25:08] be in that 98% bracket be in the 2%
[25:12] bracket and if you have self- custody
[25:14] and you know your friend does not have
[25:16] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[25:17] he needs a birthday present and a small
[25:20] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[25:22] 5% off your order plus you support my
[25:25] channel and now let's get back to the
[25:27] video your pin tweet also says that this
[25:30] is not a NE negotiation uh or at least I
[25:33] think I saw it in in your your your
[25:36] Twitter profile uh which I also like a
[25:39] lot because I always say like we should
[25:41] orange pill we should be should uh put
[25:44] the people that we love in the direction
[25:46] of of of Bitcoin but in the end of the
[25:48] day it if Bitcoin is actually sound
[25:51] money we don't need to do that like
[25:54] Bitcoin will will take a care of of its
[25:57] own is it already written in stone that
[26:00] Bitcoin is is successful and that those
[26:03] uh path that we now splitting up the uh
[26:06] money in state that we will actually do
[26:08] that
[26:10] ran in in engineering after certain
[26:14] proficiency of execution and a good
[26:17] level of education and I I'm not going
[26:19] to say I'm probably smartest person but
[26:21] I know do know a lot of smart people I
[26:24] realized in in engineering the highest
[26:25] level of of an engineer is an integrator
[26:29] satosi Nakamoto is an integrator he took
[26:33] matures
[26:34] Technologies evolved Technologies
[26:36] confirmed within over decades and he
[26:39] integrated in a different set of places
[26:42] to make Bitcoin the protocol and the
[26:45] network and the currency and everything
[26:47] function
[26:48] together for you to attack a technology
[26:52] you have a minimum of a maximum of three
[26:57] years and Bitcoin even though by 2013
[27:01] had only 3 years with monetary value
[27:04] Bitcoin already had four years of
[27:06] existence so the attacks the the 51%
[27:10] attack the the Nal of service attack the
[27:14] code Gap that they found on this bug for
[27:17] the 21 million Bitcoin that were issued
[27:19] in one block so on so forward that was
[27:22] too
[27:23] late the state was too
[27:26] late so no there's no way to kill
[27:29] Bitcoin now and if they kill Bitcoin
[27:32] we're going to come with something else
[27:34] that is equally decentralized that is
[27:37] it's basically a photocopy of Bitcoin
[27:39] just that the Bitcoin protocol that
[27:41] these guys um allow us to grow uh was
[27:45] working on a double 200 two and a double
[27:48] sha 256 hash well this one would be on a
[27:51] triple or will be on a 512 sha
[27:55] encryption mode so if would be
[27:58] impossible we already found the exit is
[28:01] either this exit or a bigger one which
[28:04] is more encrypted and more safe so on so
[28:07] forth but nowadays if you look at the
[28:09] Bitcoin Network on itself we are over
[28:12] 200
[28:13] times the highest hash level we were
[28:17] doing during the biggest attacks on
[28:19] bitcoin from 2013 to 2018 those were
[28:24] probably the five ugliest years for
[28:26] Bitcoin and and still we're breathing
[28:29] because Bitcoin is designed to be
[28:31] attacked so when he was attacked early
[28:33] on on on within the the the early years
[28:36] that's when sheits came out so if you if
[28:39] you touch certain animals they will spit
[28:41] on you or they will throw you darts or
[28:44] things like that well beon is like that
[28:46] because it's a virus it's a monetary
[28:49] virus and to be more
[28:52] precise in reality if you're a religious
[28:54] human being is the second coming of
[28:58] Jesus cuz the first time God sent his
[29:00] son we [ __ ] butchered him and now he
[29:03] said [ __ ] I'm not going to do the same
[29:04] they're going to kill him again but but
[29:06] then he realized that we had broken
[29:10] money that the money that was not broken
[29:12] or semi not broken was still
[29:15] captured and we have to wait for the
[29:18] initiation of the internet to become
[29:20] digital to now truly be
[29:23] free I can cross an airport anywhere in
[29:26] the world nowadays with over a 100 times
[29:30] what is the minimum or the maximum that
[29:33] you can cross officially and they can do
[29:35] nothing about it
[29:38] nothing cuz I got it here if your money
[29:42] is in your head your money is all over
[29:44] the
[29:45] world all over the world so it's already
[29:48] there it's not that you brought some
[29:49] money to the country no the money is
[29:51] already
[29:52] here and that's that's Checkmate and the
[29:56] beauty about it is that the incentives
[29:59] are allines for enemies whoever you are
[30:02] in the world is in your best interest to
[30:05] have your money not being manipulable by
[30:09] anyone in the specific case of Bitcoin
[30:12] if Russia had their assets not in
[30:15] treasury bonds 600 billion but if they
[30:19] had it in Bitcoin the us could have not
[30:21] done anything about it nothing but now
[30:24] the us is going to take those $600
[30:26] billion doll in treasuries and give it
[30:28] to Ukraine through giving it through the
[30:31] industrial military complex because
[30:33] they're not giving it to Ukraine they
[30:35] are sending it they're taking their part
[30:37] and then bringing it back to the
[30:39] military industrial company so it's
[30:41] Checkmate it's just a matter of
[30:45] time go ahead no it was interesting for
[30:48] me when you said uh Bitcoin is the
[30:50] second coming of Jesus um and there's a
[30:53] lot of this this new concept of the time
[30:55] chain uh which also f not like will we
[31:00] at some point have the time where like
[31:02] before Bitcoin before satosi and after
[31:05] Satoshi will will Bitcoin be that
[31:07] significant in the long run but it's a
[31:09] different topic if you no doubt Rob no
[31:12] doubt because taking account this you
[31:14] were not able to have an asset that had
[31:18] value unless you hide it properly if you
[31:22] were very rich you have large quantities
[31:24] which implies that you will have to have
[31:26] great security to hold these assets as
[31:30] an example the drug dealers in the past
[31:33] and I give you a specific name um this
[31:37] psychopath crazy local
[31:40] Esco he had so much freaking money I I
[31:44] believe over9 billion doar at the time
[31:46] he was within the 10 10th wealthiest man
[31:50] on Earth that his money that was pack on
[31:54] what we call ketas which is hiding
[31:57] places all over many parts of the cities
[31:59] and in his farms and in his different
[32:01] real estate he used to get
[32:04] funguses because he had so much money he
[32:07] couldn't move it they had to lock it in
[32:09] different places and he got it got Mo he
[32:12] got funguses so a lot of that money just
[32:15] deteriorated because yeah he was not
[32:17] paying any taxes it was away from the
[32:20] state but it was so much but in the case
[32:24] of Bitcoin you can have so much and it
[32:26] still be a save as so little so it's
[32:30] it's I mean it's Checkmate for the state
[32:32] it is certainly a big turnning Humanity
[32:35] because now we have no way of doubting
[32:38] that the Deb has been settled everybody
[32:41] had done business with Bitcoin through
[32:43] my time in Bitcoin I don't owe them
[32:46] anything and they don't owe me anything
[32:48] it's settled it's beautiful and you a
[32:52] new world a new order that we we kind of
[32:55] created how does this uh when we are not
[32:57] not depending on the government when the
[32:59] government and money is is kind of free
[33:01] and we don't have this bond between
[33:03] money and government and uh we we are
[33:06] separated that how how does a world look
[33:08] like uh when we have this like how how
[33:11] do you see uh society and a world
[33:14] changing or is it not changing too much
[33:17] on my first
[33:19] month of of being involved I been
[33:22] tweeted with Rd with
[33:25] Greg with uh
[33:28] Marcus with a whole bunch of people with
[33:31] Yello I I was giv gladly the Seal of
[33:36] Bitcoin
[33:37] maximalist and I although I did accept
[33:40] it and I took it from some friends who
[33:42] sent it to me because they took your
[33:43] profile picture and they did put bco
[33:45] maximalist around it I realized that I
[33:48] could not um share it and express it
[33:51] because I cannot be a Bitcoin maximalist
[33:54] if I am already a Bitcoin realist you
[33:56] see there is a about 15 million Bitcoin
[33:59] in the hands of
[34:01] us and when I mean us the bitcoiners
[34:05] which know its value and we have not
[34:07] released it yet because we believe
[34:09] humanity is not ready to be at peace
[34:13] with money that cannot be manipulated
[34:16] it's going to take some time we we have
[34:18] to let this clown word take the pendulum
[34:21] to the extreme which is what we are for
[34:25] we have been for the past three years
[34:28] three five years we are in the hands of
[34:31] satanic pedophiles narcot traffickers
[34:35] murderers you name it terrorists the
[34:38] worst of humankind nowadays is in the
[34:42] top places of political influence in the
[34:46] world and behind them people with larger
[34:48] power are connected to
[34:51] them so we got you have to let the tree
[34:56] die and let the seed that you put
[34:59] underneath to bake through the roots and
[35:02] that's what we're doing with Bitcoin
[35:04] we're ranting about it we are explaining
[35:07] why everything else is a
[35:09] shitcoin but we are also patient because
[35:11] it gives us the opportunity to stock
[35:14] more Sals cheap
[35:16] Sals and you gota you got to learn the
[35:19] opportunity you have a life that your
[35:21] generation and my generations and the
[35:24] generations in between and the ones far
[35:26] ahead we do have a light for the future
[35:30] there is a probability to be in peace to
[35:33] have countries not fighting on a
[35:35] constant basis from some physical
[35:37] Frontiers that is just nothing when
[35:39] you're flying or a helicopter in a
[35:41] frontier or a plane you don't see the
[35:42] borders I mean there's some different
[35:45] exceptions like in Mexico with this wall
[35:48] in the United States but for the rest
[35:50] there is none there's natural boundaries
[35:54] but in reality there's no difference
[35:56] between one tax far the other you as a
[35:59] human being want exactly the same stuff
[36:02] as I want you want you want to be
[36:05] wealthy you want to be healthy you want
[36:07] to have a family you have to have a roof
[36:09] over your head and you want to live in
[36:11] peace but politicians don't give us that
[36:14] they give us uncertainty they give us
[36:16] surprising news that this guy just
[36:18] screwed up and we found him and when
[36:20] they put him on television he say no I
[36:22] done nothing you got no idea what this
[36:24] other person did and they're in the show
[36:26] of pointing each other fingers while the
[36:30] people are confused not realizing there
[36:32] is a circus that what we keep on
[36:35] thinking about politics and we keep on
[36:37] thinking about our borders and our
[36:39] security and zones of over these [ __ ]
[36:41] are pretty stealing from us if you had
[36:45] $100,000 at the beginning of the year by
[36:47] the end of the year you will have the
[36:49] capacity to acquire what
[36:52] $9,000 could buy at the beginning of the
[36:55] year because there was a 10% inflation
[36:57] the United States and I I live there
[36:59] probably a third of my life if not more
[37:02] and on top of that the the there being
[37:06] the fact that they were the world
[37:08] Reserve currency gave him the ability of
[37:10] not needing to feel such a high
[37:12] inflation so if you were working for a a
[37:14] multinational corporation and you got a
[37:17] three to 5% rise man you were doing good
[37:21] because inflation was 1 and a half 2%
[37:24] every
[37:25] year but now suddenly you the United
[37:27] States got a taste of what inflation is
[37:30] what all over the countries of the world
[37:33] especially the countries that are not
[37:37] so influential financially nor
[37:39] politically nor military we do feel the
[37:42] 10 50 20% inflation so we were used to
[37:46] being robbed but we didn't have any tool
[37:49] to defend ourselves what's the future
[37:51] going to be the future is going to be
[37:52] that states are going to be run at least
[37:54] the law is going to be run by code
[37:58] and then in general terms if the code is
[38:00] run well then punishments will be
[38:03] assigned and certain crimes will have to
[38:05] go to jury but the basic operation of a
[38:08] city or the basic operation of a c will
[38:10] be run through code computers
[38:14] AI the the rest people will will still
[38:17] be providing services in fact people
[38:20] nowadays can make money with Bitcoin
[38:23] they just don't know it they just need
[38:25] to approach their customer and say do
[38:28] you want to pay whatever or do you want
[38:30] to pay in Bitcoin if you pay in Bitcoin
[38:34] I don't charge you
[38:36] B8 and they say okay fine paying Bitcoin
[38:39] so you got a 20% discount in everything
[38:41] that you purchase who's going to know
[38:44] they got no way of knowing and that's a
[38:47] problem for the state because anybody
[38:49] you speak with they had paying taxes the
[38:53] United States started a Civil War for
[38:56] the 2 % tax on
[38:59] te two two or three something like that
[39:02] ridiculous but nowadays they pay over 40
[39:05] over 50% taxes and he's fine because
[39:09] they stupid eyes
[39:10] them keep them ignorant May their only
[39:14] think about their country and they may
[39:17] work all over the world spreading their
[39:19] the Petr dollar I cannot speak bad about
[39:22] the dollar because I earn income through
[39:23] the services I provide in dollars and in
[39:27] Eur
[39:28] but it's still they are a
[39:31] shitcoin because we know by the end of
[39:33] the year the inflation is going to go
[39:35] with two 3 4 5 10 20 30 200% like in
[39:39] some other countries so if somebody oh
[39:42] there is not enough adoption of Bitcoin
[39:44] in the world [ __ ] there is a lot of
[39:47] adoption of Bitcoin in the world it's
[39:48] just that people don't realize they can
[39:50] start earn in Bitcoin but you're saying
[39:53] pay me in Bitcoin do you have a so you
[39:56] do you think that Fiat completely will
[39:58] will will die off at some point do you
[40:00] have like a a time frame for
[40:02] that 20 years maximum but I think in
[40:06] less I think in 15 years Fiat will be
[40:09] dead we will have a ramp up appreciation
[40:12] of the US dollar for the probably next
[40:15] five years that will be good for
[40:17] bitcoiners in United States and that
[40:18] will be great for bitcoiners all over
[40:21] the world all over the world because the
[40:22] US dollar is going to get expensive then
[40:26] we didn't less than two years bricks is
[40:28] going to accept Bitcoin cuz they're
[40:31] already mining Bitcoin they just not put
[40:33] it in a front because it's nothing their
[40:35] advantage I'm sure China has more
[40:37] Bitcoin than United States they just
[40:38] don't declare it and if United States
[40:42] has so much Bitcoin Ouray if you have
[40:44] 217 why would you sell just 4,000
[40:46] Bitcoin they're toying with
[40:49] us and if you believe even a politician
[40:52] tells you about Bitcoin it's [ __ ]
[40:55] but they want you vot and we love to
[40:57] hear that oh I'm going to make this uh
[41:00] Bitcoin country only
[41:02] [ __ ] they want to tax you because
[41:04] they need to be paid and for them to be
[41:06] paid the state has to be paid and if
[41:09] it's not paid they're going to steal
[41:11] from you through inflation because they
[41:13] gota be paid I mean I don't hate this
[41:15] state I just don't like it when it
[41:17] steals from me what's your what's your
[41:19] favorite State uh is it El Salvador Oh
[41:22] you mean country where tax Farm um no
[41:26] I'm not pick fan of of of a tax Farms
[41:29] like I like people I don't I don't I
[41:34] avoid asking somebody where he's from to
[41:38] to avoid taking a perception of their
[41:41] personality uh but you can tell from the
[41:43] accient and you can tell from their
[41:46] their behavior where they're from but to
[41:48] me the person is more important than
[41:51] than the the tax Farm they are
[41:53] registered in yeah I like that and it's
[41:56] it's good also um you said something I
[41:58] don't know if you said it before
[41:59] recording or after we started recording
[42:02] you said you come in Bitcoin and your
[42:04] brain explodes it goes in so many
[42:07] different direction
[42:09] like it's like smoking weed if your
[42:12] brain is properly if your brain here's
[42:15] the key about weed if your brain is
[42:18] properly wired when you smoke weed you
[42:21] will feel like all the lights in your
[42:23] house have been turned on to maximum and
[42:26] you can go into to any room and find
[42:28] things and do things and if you are you
[42:30] have good energy and and if you are
[42:33] educated smart you will become extremely
[42:36] creative but if your brain is not fully
[42:39] connected when you smoke withed you get
[42:43] lazy and you go dumb that's the reality
[42:46] of it based on the experience that I
[42:48] have so we as humans when we started
[42:53] study Bitcoin we realize that we don't
[42:57] learn anything about it in the school
[42:59] about money they don't tell you how to
[43:01] have a bank account they don't take you
[43:03] tell you about a a mortgage they don't
[43:05] they don't teach you anything about
[43:07] money and in general terms in most of
[43:09] the families when you bring the topic
[43:11] about money in the table people say oh
[43:14] that's un poite so getting into Bitcoin
[43:17] means you have to learn a new language
[43:20] and the language is a language to
[43:22] transfer value that's Andreas told me
[43:24] that he said is is a language to
[43:28] transfer value between two entities two
[43:32] parts and when you learn everything that
[43:35] is around it how you protect it how is
[43:37] is UN mutable you fall in love with it
[43:40] because you truthfully settled with
[43:42] people you settled your depths and you
[43:45] pay them for your services I I try to
[43:48] huddle as much as possible but because
[43:50] I'm a human being I like toys so
[43:53] obviously I have spent some money on
[43:56] toys ER but it's very refreshing because
[43:59] you know that the person that received
[44:01] the Bitcoin is happy as hell that they
[44:03] pay that that they got paid on it
[44:05] because they know it's money that nobody
[44:07] can touch so most of the people that buy
[44:09] Bitcoin they live it for their
[44:11] retirement 15 20 years ahead and in fact
[44:14] the longer you are in Bitcoin the more
[44:18] money you make in Bitcoin and when I
[44:20] mean money is in Bitcoin terms what do
[44:23] you think is um well you talked before
[44:26] about that 15 years to uh that they'll
[44:29] feat will die off what what do you see
[44:32] as like those those Milestones those
[44:35] events that has to happen I feel like a
[44:37] hyper inflation like the the
[44:38] consolidation to the US Dollars we see
[44:41] it already now like the US dollar is in
[44:43] in like how many countries 60 70
[44:45] countries already uh and this will
[44:47] happen more and more and more um how do
[44:50] how do you see the that transition time
[44:52] from now till till Fiat actually dies
[44:55] off that's a topic I think quently
[44:58] discuss with my father who gladly is
[45:00] alive over 80 years old and he's a
[45:03] Bitcoin it took me two years to Orange
[45:05] Peel him because I didn't know how to
[45:07] orang peel so he help me let's say
[45:10] improve my
[45:11] methodology but the interesting part of
[45:15] this transition
[45:16] between bit between fiia to bitcoin is
[45:21] pain sadly is pain so we will see
[45:25] hyperinflation specifically in Wicked
[45:28] production countries or in countries
[45:30] that only sell raw materials there you
[45:33] will see hyperinflation but also you
[45:36] will see it in the US because now they
[45:38] realize they can steal from our North
[45:42] American friends and they don't do [ __ ]
[45:47] they're not doing [ __ ] the only thing
[45:49] they are choosing between the orange
[45:51] president or between the I don't know
[45:54] how to classify Biden because I believe
[45:56] he's probably he's been probably one of
[45:58] the worst Presidents of that country I
[46:01] mean he's done everything wrong
[46:03] specifically because he's done nothing
[46:05] other people do it and he just approves
[46:07] it um the transition is going to be
[46:09] painful but uh in the same
[46:12] proportion that pain will be replaced by
[46:16] our
[46:18] wealth and we will be extremely rich at
[46:20] that time and like I said if you own a
[46:24] Bitcoin by the time you will be able
[46:26] able to run your CIT today 20,000 30,000
[46:30] people working for the environment that
[46:32] you
[46:33] created so we go back to to situations
[46:37] like what we at least I how was dreamed
[46:39] of is to be able to retire and not worry
[46:42] about anything wake up eating breakfast
[46:45] and I'm free for the rest of the day
[46:46] that's what I want to get to it's going
[46:49] to take five more years 7 years and I'm
[46:52] done and still I'm going to be starting
[46:54] Bitcoin because it helps you grow I
[46:56] realiz for example in the case of my
[46:58] father that about three five years ago
[47:02] mentally he was slowing down his
[47:05] proficiency and his ability to share
[47:08] experiences so on so forth but when we
[47:11] started talking starting bigcoin he just
[47:14] snapped out of it and he's as as clear
[47:18] as a a 40 50 year old person when he's
[47:21] expressing himself so it's a way to keep
[47:23] your mind new and healthy by educ
[47:26] getting yourself about the hardest money
[47:28] do you have a framework because you said
[47:30] like uh breakfast and then nothing free
[47:32] from the day do you have a framework
[47:34] where you're like that's how many
[47:37] Bitcoin you need to retire I mean
[47:40] obviously it depends on on what kind of
[47:42] a life you want to live after retirement
[47:44] but uh do you have a framework for that
[47:46] like how many Bitcoins you aim for is is
[47:50] that the one
[47:52] Bitcoin let's say in a 10 year frame
[47:57] if you have one Bitcoin you can retire
[47:59] in a 15E frame you have half a Bitcoin
[48:02] you can't retire in a 20- year frame if
[48:05] you have at least 1 million Sates you
[48:08] can
[48:10] retire and and if by 20 25 years 20 by
[48:14] 25 30 years if you have a Bitcoin you
[48:17] can you can have a c to there so people
[48:20] who don't have money there who who have
[48:23] no way of um purchasing sat Tois or
[48:27] Nakamoto at the time they will be able
[48:29] to work for Nakamoto and by the time
[48:32] they acquire 100 million Nakamoto they
[48:34] have one
[48:35] Satoshi and after they acquire I don't
[48:37] know a million satoshis then they are I
[48:39] wouldn't say free but they be able to
[48:41] move into other
[48:43] Citys and then be able to get their
[48:46] Bitcoin C over there for them to stay in
[48:49] that place and earn more Sates and then
[48:52] become a bitcoiner a full bitcoiner to
[48:54] have their own Citadel
[48:57] people don't realize the magnitude of
[48:59] the chain of the change that we're
[49:01] living through especially when you got
[49:03] into the Bitcoin train because people
[49:06] continue looking backwards people
[49:08] continue looking back to the feia system
[49:10] and that's one of the worst things you
[49:12] can do in your life if you break up an
[49:14] emotional relationship and you keep
[49:15] looking at it at what you had what you
[49:17] did what you didn't like what whatever
[49:20] you still living on
[49:22] it but when you when you realize that
[49:25] you're in a different path just turn
[49:27] around and look in the Iration that you
[49:30] want I stopped looking at at the
[49:33] national TV for for let's say for news
[49:38] 30 years ago when I started my
[49:41] career and then I realized that I'm a
[49:44] much healthier person so turn away from
[49:48] the enemy's messaging turn away from the
[49:51] enemy's money turn away from the enemy's
[49:54] traps or that that rat rate
[49:57] and realize that now we have money we
[50:00] can tell them to [ __ ] off I love it a
[50:03] lot that episode already it's it's
[50:05] really really cool to talk with you
[50:08] um on that note for for consuming news I
[50:12] also right now I'm I'm basically only
[50:14] consuming through a uh and and that's
[50:17] basically it like a and then for long
[50:19] format I go to to YouTube um to consume
[50:22] some stuff um and I don't know I don't
[50:25] even know when I last turn on the
[50:28] television for news I never I don't
[50:30] maybe like 10 years or five years I have
[50:32] have really no clue and I'm really young
[50:34] I'm 25
[50:35] so I've lived in this world now with
[50:39] with X um what what is your vision for
[50:42] like a Bitcoin Citadel is you mentioned
[50:45] that a lot like is is Bitcoin Citadel
[50:48] the the future of like how we reorganize
[50:51] in in in in a society or like how do you
[50:53] see those citadels yes yes it is it is
[50:57] the reason it is the reason why I
[50:59] believe we have hope because the states
[51:02] are completely unfunctional I'm going to
[51:04] give you an example one of the the tax
[51:07] Farms that I uh spend my time in it's
[51:12] run by narcot traffickers
[51:16] pedophilers uh drug dealers terrorists
[51:20] murderers those are the ones who write
[51:23] the rules in this tax farm so obviously
[51:26] I don't want to pay them taxes I just
[51:29] want to pay them whatever they say I
[51:31] have to pay them and that's it because
[51:33] the rest is in the digital real realm
[51:37] they are so entrenched into stealing the
[51:41] national
[51:43] treasury through inflation through their
[51:45] salaries through their concessions
[51:48] through their business deals in real
[51:50] estate and gold and some other assets
[51:53] that they don't have time to look in the
[51:55] cancer that they have already within
[51:57] society which is Bitcoin Bitcoin is a
[51:59] cancer Bitcoin is a virus that is going
[52:02] to kill everything that is broken and he
[52:04] killing it my maid or whoever supplies
[52:08] me Services nowadays after eight years
[52:11] of dealing with me they all know that I
[52:14] can get them Bitcoin and I teach them
[52:16] about Bitcoin and some of them have
[52:18] started requesting me to pay them in
[52:20] Bitcoin citadels will go through that
[52:23] path because then by the time we have so
[52:26] much chaos within government they be so
[52:28] compressed between their own fight
[52:30] arguing about who's more corrupt or who
[52:32] has stolen more than the other is small
[52:34] communities will start providing
[52:37] security food and services for
[52:41] themselves we have the technology
[52:42] nowadays to be completely independent
[52:44] from society other than of course
[52:47] getting an internet supplier you can get
[52:49] your own electricity through either
[52:51] solar or other media of providing energy
[52:54] you can get your water by different
[52:57] processes so it's just a matter of
[53:00] organizing within communities and that
[53:01] will not happen until Bitcoin is above
[53:05] certain Fiat value what is that Fiat
[53:07] value huh you're only asking for the
[53:10] best correct you just want the best
[53:12] answers on it yes okay um based on the
[53:17] side codes I mean you know we are it is
[53:19] 58,000 forever okay but the 58,000
[53:23] forever like I said earlier comes from
[53:25] the 21 1,000 gang and comes from the
[53:28] 15,000 gang and comes from the 9,000
[53:31] gang and from the 2,000 gang so all this
[53:35] history about gangs in Bitcoin is
[53:37] because there are cycles that are been
[53:39] identified by the people who has
[53:40] involved in it and study how price
[53:43] correlates we
[53:45] have Cycles on our pricing and what's
[53:49] coming next in the within this next 12
[53:52] months is going to be
[53:54] brutal and by going through this process
[53:58] many people are going to go nuts some of
[54:00] them are going to get desperate and sell
[54:02] their Bitcoin to get more Fiat and then
[54:04] realize they messed it up but the
[54:07] stabilization value of Bitcoin will be
[54:10] around
[54:12] uh an order an order of magnitude from
[54:16] 58k and it will stabilize
[54:19] there so we have
[54:23] approximately one more halfin
[54:26] to start the development of citadels So
[54:29] within five years we will start seeing
[54:33] um small citadels being formed in
[54:36] isolated areas of of the world where the
[54:40] state as you know geopolitically state
[54:43] has the ability to exert their strength
[54:46] that means they have power over the land
[54:49] but there are obviously certain areas of
[54:51] the plant of the planet that are
[54:53] difficult to access for the state and
[54:54] are very expensive that is what the
[54:57] first CAD would
[54:59] happen we have about 10 years of a lot
[55:02] of [ __ ] coming up our way and I don't
[55:04] mean we B coiners but
[55:07] humanity and the issue is that human
[55:10] nowadays humans are divided into two
[55:13] groups we have a war between human
[55:16] beings and
[55:18] humans and a human is a greedy
[55:23] [ __ ]
[55:24] selfish will do anything anything to get
[55:27] ahead what a human being will
[55:30] realize that his wealth depends on the
[55:34] wealth of his environment the wealth of
[55:36] the people that is around him so Bitcoin
[55:40] is the money for human
[55:42] beings and is the money for AI and this
[55:45] those these two kinds of civilizations
[55:48] AI which is evolving slowly but it's
[55:51] already here and human beings will
[55:54] isolate themselves from
[55:56] amazing it's it's uh it's really cool to
[55:59] talk with you you have amazing fs and
[56:02] it's like uh I could go on with my
[56:04] questions but we already at the one hour
[56:06] mark and uh I have a few more questions
[56:09] before we come to the end routines um
[56:12] but the the one the two things that I
[56:15] asked myself uh when when I saw your
[56:17] account when you saw your ex account
[56:19] also first of like like where's the
[56:21] accountant the the the name coming from
[56:24] I know there's also a movie is like is
[56:27] it some some something related to that
[56:30] that is the
[56:32] accountant that is what will come to you
[56:35] at the end of your life and ask you what
[56:38] you done with
[56:39] it so is the place where you have to say
[56:42] the truth and I've
[56:45] been I've gone through extreme
[56:48] experiences in my life I've been
[56:51] extremely close to death I had intense
[56:55] against my life probably three I also
[56:59] been uh shot I've been
[57:03] stabbed I've been in a I I've been in
[57:06] more accidents than I have years of
[57:08] alive of being alive and gladly God has
[57:11] a mission for me I don't know why but he
[57:13] has a mission for me so I'm I'm here and
[57:16] I'm 100%
[57:18] functional uh but I realize that the
[57:20] beauty in death is that you cannot cheat
[57:23] and and I found that death in biton qu
[57:26] close because you cannot cheat in
[57:28] Bitcoin and you cannot cheat in De that
[57:30] will take you when it wants you and
[57:32] Bitcoin will take the plant the planet
[57:35] when it wants it's a digital
[57:39] artificial animal that is pulsing every
[57:44] 10 minutes no matter what and in this SP
[57:46] that you just got in and that many other
[57:48] Bitcoins are starting and some of us
[57:50] that keep on roll on this boat realize
[57:53] that this is the path to be better so
[57:57] I'm I'm accounting myself to myself I'm
[58:00] accounting myself to my family to my
[58:02] friends to my friends GM that we need to
[58:08] help each other we help each other by
[58:09] following the
[58:11] truth so um the Bitcoin Corporation is a
[58:15] very large organization you might not be
[58:18] aware but you're part of
[58:20] it and even though is not an official
[58:23] entity all bitcoiners are part of it the
[58:26] friends the enemies the ones that call
[58:29] you scammer the ones that call you
[58:31] whatever because you come up with an
[58:32] idea doesn't matter they are all part of
[58:36] it so This Global
[58:39] community that has if I believe correct
[58:42] we have over 100 million soldiers we
[58:45] cannot be
[58:47] defeated the the quality of human beings
[58:50] that are in Bitcoin is just
[58:53] amazing I I have I I had the opportunity
[58:56] to to sit with some in person and to to
[59:00] share with some other some spaces and
[59:03] some meetings and it's just something
[59:05] that is unable how somebody else can be
[59:08] so bright and so smart and still be in
[59:11] consensus with you which allows you to
[59:14] believe that you can grow and learn more
[59:17] from that people so memes are the tool
[59:20] to talk to
[59:21] ourselves and without memes we go
[59:24] nowhere that's that's our weapon
[59:27] so Rowan I I just think that you just
[59:31] got to give it time let the shed settled
[59:35] let all these corrupt politicians just
[59:37] screw themselves because they're being
[59:40] Guided by devilish
[59:42] Intentions by by completely deform
[59:46] intention reality and the way to to
[59:49] defend ourselves is obviously through
[59:52] the study and the understanding of
[59:55] Bitcoin because it's already already the
[59:56] ground is already laid you just got to
[59:59] walk it it's uh it's very fascinating
[60:02] your your answers I love it a lot um
[60:05] before we come to end routine I have one
[60:07] last questions to to your Twitter
[60:08] account um you write a lot or almost
[60:12] everything in
[60:13] uppercase oh why is that because you see
[60:18] my my small caps bottom
[60:21] broke and and I don't have budget for it
[60:25] like
[60:26] we didn't have budget for the for the
[60:29] Hing party I told the guys at the M
[60:32] factory don't do it we don't have budget
[60:34] for it they went ahead and did it they
[60:36] overid it they spent all that money on
[60:38] it they could have Stu more sets and and
[60:41] we are in a tight budget Robin we only
[60:43] have 21 million Bitcoin no more so I'm
[60:47] not going to spend a couple of bucks in
[60:48] the small key bottom I'm just going to
[60:51] leave like that keep it on on large cups
[60:54] oh great perfect then our has two
[60:56] questions the first question is always
[60:58] the same question to every guest and the
[60:59] last and the last question is coming
[61:01] from the previous guest um first
[61:04] question what are you passionate about
[61:06] besides Bitcoin what is your passion uh
[61:10] the that is not related to bitcoin not
[61:13] related to bitcoin [ __ ] everything is
[61:15] related to bitcoin man everything is
[61:17] related to bitcoin health is related to
[61:20] bitcoin because that's what you confirm
[61:22] that you're doing things right um how is
[61:25] are related to to bitcoin because
[61:26] whether it or not if you want to grow in
[61:28] your hobby you that money cannot go to
[61:31] to bitcoin so it's got to be something
[61:33] worth
[61:33] it and education is related to bitcoin
[61:36] because no matter what if you come to
[61:38] the truth you come to something related
[61:40] to bitcoin but now that you ask me
[61:44] um I'm my hobes are I like exercising my
[61:48] body I like to keep it in shape and I
[61:51] love
[61:52] motorcycles so those are the two things
[61:55] that I try to to do other than than
[61:59] working on my business and and working
[62:01] in Bitcoin working in Bitcoin is really
[62:04] fulfilling I love it too um the last
[62:07] question is coming from a previous guest
[62:09] uh my my Andro in is always the previous
[62:12] guest is asking a question for the next
[62:14] guest without knowing who the next guest
[62:15] actually is um and the question for you
[62:18] is if you could sit down with any one
[62:21] podcaster to chat about Bitcoin or
[62:23] anything else who would it be is that it
[62:26] okay um if I guess I would see with with
[62:31] Satoshi Nakamoto if he was a podcaster
[62:33] but to interview
[62:35] him not to talk because I mean the guy
[62:39] the guy is is not just a genius the guy
[62:41] just show us the path and without the
[62:43] path we got nowhere to go I mean I was I
[62:46] was in a right raceing life just trying
[62:48] to to get ahead of it and I always found
[62:50] that somebody was stealing from me one
[62:52] way or another and I thought she just
[62:54] just opened the door for us to walk away
[62:57] from that Fiat theft yeah I got some
[63:01] some things I'd like to share with you I
[63:03] guess if we have the time no definitely
[63:06] of course okay good good good um first
[63:10] of all uh previously to the last Bull
[63:14] Run um we in Bitcoin Twitter which now
[63:18] is called X but I mean whatever
[63:20] whichever number they put it it is the
[63:22] front line to deal with normies that's
[63:25] why I have not gone to nor because there
[63:27] only bitcoiners there so I I need to
[63:30] speak with normis I need to crash with
[63:31] normis to let it know what's happening
[63:34] um but we gota we got to take the wings
[63:37] and I like to count the wings for
[63:38] Bitcoin we [ __ ] up the new new world
[63:42] order we really [ __ ] up the New World
[63:44] Order also bco is always under attack
[63:49] don't be surprise whatever is happening
[63:51] bitco it's being attacked whatever dude
[63:53] buy more shcks buy more shs no matter
[63:56] what happens there will be an
[63:59] opportunity with Bitcoin
[64:02] ahead Bitcoin is the black hole of value
[64:05] we all heard that and it's important to
[64:07] keep it in mind because if you have some
[64:09] assets and you really want to save the
[64:11] only option is to choose
[64:13] Bitcoin and I cannot predict what the
[64:16] fed's going to do but I can predict what
[64:18] Bitcoin is going to do and right now we
[64:19] are about
[64:21] 1.57% inflation through this year and
[64:24] next year is going to be .58 so it's
[64:27] going to be a great opportunity for all
[64:28] of us if we stack
[64:31] properly and last but not least during
[64:35] that bull run the discussion was you got
[64:37] to be building you gotta be building you
[64:40] got to do something for the community so
[64:43] during that process me as an integrator
[64:46] I believe that the best thing I could do
[64:48] is to work on a
[64:50] wallet and we have within our group we
[64:54] have a coder and we have obviously
[64:57] critics and we have friends and
[65:00] friendenemies so this Bitcoin wallet
[65:03] that the Bitcoin Corporation will be
[65:04] putting out I don't know how soon
[65:06] because it's a lengthy process we have
[65:08] to go also through the beta process to
[65:11] do a testing will have certain
[65:12] characteristics that I believe you will
[65:14] like a lot and probably many bitcoiners
[65:17] so I'm going to read some of them
[65:19] obviously open source code so everybody
[65:22] who can read code can read
[65:24] it uh it will
[65:27] uh allow you to choose the asset you
[65:31] want to present your savings in satosi
[65:35] Bitcoin or Nakamoto obviously the
[65:38] portion of the Nakamoto will be
[65:40] necessary within 10 years but you will
[65:43] be already in
[65:45] operation also the the Bitcoin wallet
[65:49] would allow you to use the four highways
[65:52] that we currently have in Bitcoin Legacy
[65:54] Segway tap rot and
[65:58] lining um the Bitcoin wallet will allow
[66:00] you to choose the amount of wordss that
[66:03] you choose for your your pneumonic seed
[66:06] so it will go from 12 to
[66:09] 36 you can do 18 24 36 I mean you choose
[66:13] how encrypted you want your
[66:15] wallet uh additionally it will be adding
[66:19] a modules of services for rentals so for
[66:22] example if you're
[66:23] traveling you can rent a place where
[66:27] you're going to be traveling and paying
[66:28] in Bitcoin around the road we expect to
[66:31] have the ability to have assets on the
[66:34] wallet but it's quite ambitious so it's
[66:36] going to take some time those probably
[66:39] will be are the major factors of the
[66:43] wallet of the Bitcoin corporation that
[66:45] will have no economical benefit neither
[66:48] to me or anyone on the organization but
[66:50] for the community um with that in mind
[66:52] my friend I guess if you have any other
[66:55] questions I have to come up with a
[66:56] question for the next guest definitely I
[66:59] usually do it offline but you can
[67:01] definitely already do it
[67:03] now yes I believe the the question to
[67:07] the next guest is what is your Bitcoin
[67:09] goal and I don't mean in regards of uh
[67:13] the number of Bitcoin you want to
[67:15] acquire or stock or that told you know
[67:17] what is your goal with Bitcoin let's say
[67:20] you get whatever you want in Bitcoin
[67:22] what do you want to do with
[67:24] it that's something that we all must
[67:26] have in mind because you're stacking for
[67:28] stacking no it has no it has no benefit
[67:32] for the future of the of that family
[67:35] because if you keep on stacking stacking
[67:37] stacking stacking you will never be able
[67:38] to realize a standard of living that
[67:40] will be good for you and you might die
[67:42] in the way you might have a car accident
[67:44] a motorcycle accident a health issue and
[67:48] oh yeah you were able to accumulate two
[67:50] Bitcoin but you died so make sure you
[67:53] you put a goal for the stack that you
[67:55] want to have once you reach it change
[67:58] your style of living and then if you can
[68:00] stack more fine but you got your goal
[68:03] cuz if you don't do that you're going to
[68:04] be always running for more and you will
[68:06] never get that that's a beautiful end uh
[68:10] you use your Bitcoin don't stack till
[68:13] till you
[68:14] die I mean you can do it there some
[68:16] people quite obsessed with it but I I
[68:19] believe we have one life so might as
[68:20] well you just enjoy it and also have
[68:24] some some toys
[68:26] and have some toys of
[68:27] course interesting enough on those toys
[68:31] which I invested close to three
[68:34] Bitcoin they are nowadays worth more
[68:37] than that because I mean it was a good
[68:40] purchase
[68:41] so I think they have they have not given
[68:44] me pleasure and and allowed me to enjoy
[68:47] what the things that I like but at the
[68:49] same time they have kept their volue so
[68:51] don't be afraid if you are stacking and
[68:54] then suddenly you have a big deire of
[68:55] something give a gift to yourself it's
[68:59] not nothing wrong with that I love it
