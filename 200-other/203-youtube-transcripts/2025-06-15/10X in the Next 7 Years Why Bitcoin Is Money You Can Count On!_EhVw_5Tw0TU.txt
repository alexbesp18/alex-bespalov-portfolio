[00:00] the price is going to go crazy because
[00:02] one it's a fixed supply uh and it is
[00:04] known and then two the buying power is
[00:07] going to be a metric that is a
[00:09] derivative off of human productivity.
[00:11] Bitcoin is a paradigm shift and like
[00:13] concerns around like is Bitcoin a medium
[00:15] exchange? Is Bitcoin going to be a unit
[00:17] of account? Like these concerns are
[00:20] really just a symptom of us being in the
[00:22] extreme early adopter phase. How many
[00:24] dollars are there Robin? Not even Jerome
[00:26] Powell knows. So, the high priests of
[00:28] fiat don't know how many dollars there
[00:30] are. Anyone can tell you how many
[00:31] Bitcoin there are. Bitcoin is money you
[00:32] can count. It's already exponentially
[00:34] better. Don't worry about it. Like,
[00:36] either Bitcoin's going to work or you're
[00:38] going to need to find another solution.
[00:39] But like, some effort we take is not
[00:42] going to change the destination of
[00:43] Bitcoin. I think no one is bullish
[00:45] enough.
[00:47] [Music]
[00:50] Uh, no one's bullish enough. So, we can
[00:52] talk about that. Yeah, I love that a
[00:55] lot. Um before we get started with the
[00:57] topics, um maybe for the few people that
[00:59] don't know you, who are you and and why
[01:01] are you excited about Bitcoin?
[01:03] Yeah, I mean I'm uh I'm just a Bitcoin
[01:06] enthusiast. Uh I've been in the space
[01:08] since uh late 2017. Uh and I dove in
[01:12] head first. I discovered Bitcoin late
[01:14] 2017, became a Bitcoin maximalist in
[01:16] like 3 months. Uh thankfully there was
[01:19] some really good content creators back
[01:21] then who were, you know, preaching
[01:22] sanity. Uh, and I was lucky enough to,
[01:26] uh, meet the folks at BTC, Inc., uh, in
[01:29] early 2018, January 2018. Uh, and I had
[01:32] already quit my fiat sales job and I,
[01:35] you know, started shaking hands and, you
[01:37] know, I told them, you know, I live in
[01:38] San Francisco. I do sales and I love
[01:40] Bitcoin. Uh, and a month later, I had a
[01:42] job at BTC, Inc. So, uh, I made my my
[01:46] name at BTC, Inc., uh, helping build
[01:49] Bitcoin magazine and the Bitcoin
[01:50] conference. Uh, and I have been really
[01:53] active in the Bitcoin space for a long
[01:55] time, you know, I guess since 2018. Uh,
[01:57] and, uh, in 2023 after 5 and a half
[02:00] years at BTC, Inc., uh, I moved over to
[02:02] the Human Rights Foundation to help them
[02:04] build out their Bitcoin program. So, uh,
[02:06] many people in Bitcoin know about the
[02:08] Human Rights Foundation. It's one of the
[02:09] nonprofits, uh, most active nonprofits
[02:12] in the Bitcoin space. Uh, it HRF is
[02:15] actually a very, very cutting edge and
[02:18] technology forward human rights
[02:20] organization. So, we've always embraced
[02:22] technology uh and we actually are
[02:24] creating this kind of timeline of how
[02:26] early we were at Bitcoin, but the
[02:28] reality is is like we used Bitcoin to
[02:30] send funds to Ukraine in 2014. Uh which
[02:33] is like super super early given that
[02:35] Bitcoin was invented in 2009. Uh, and I
[02:37] think that we back that up by, you know,
[02:39] we're a leader in, uh, Bitcoin, uh,
[02:42] grant g giving in Bitcoin, uh, as well
[02:45] as supporting open source Bitcoin
[02:47] development, and we're very active in
[02:49] the the overall Bitcoin ecosystem. So, I
[02:53] think I'm just super lucky, man. I got
[02:54] to, you know, skip the shitcoining, go
[02:57] straight to a great a great Bitcoin only
[02:59] organization, make an impact in Bitcoin,
[03:01] and now, you know, I'm I'm helping uh
[03:03] the Bitcoin ecosystem grow HRF. So, I'm
[03:05] just the luckiest guy. Awesome. And you
[03:08] quit your fear job before you you joined
[03:10] Bitcoin Inc. cuz like you're just like I
[03:13] get out of that and I want to find
[03:14] something new. Yeah. No, I I couldn't
[03:17] wait. Actually, if you look at I quit my
[03:19] job two weeks before Christmas in 2017,
[03:22] and if you look at the chart, that is
[03:23] like within 3 days of the top. So, I I
[03:26] legitimately quit my job at the top to
[03:28] go into Bitcoin full-time. And uh I
[03:30] mean, I l I'm lucky that it worked out
[03:32] because it doesn't always work out for
[03:33] people. Actually, I think the more
[03:35] common story is that you quit your fiat
[03:36] job, regret it, and then get another
[03:38] fiat job. Yeah, absolutely. It's it's
[03:41] interesting. Uh so you you quitting the
[03:44] job was the was a top signal. Definitely
[03:47] a huge top signal, but uh I'm a I'm
[03:49] still a lucky winner. Uh so the top is
[03:52] not in in yet because you're still
[03:54] working now, I think.
[03:57] Yeah, I'm still working. Yeah, but I'm
[03:59] not I'm not planning on uh on quitting
[04:01] my job based on fiat wealth or Bitcoin
[04:03] wealth. Uh you know, these days I feel
[04:06] very missional aligned. Absolutely. I
[04:09] can imagine it. Um you have one thing uh
[04:11] and I and I love that you you put it in
[04:12] the bio and and we talked about it
[04:14] before. Uh nobody is is bullish enough
[04:17] and and I had that concept brought up in
[04:19] the podcast one two times. Uh but what
[04:21] what do you mean by that and and why do
[04:24] you do it so uh why do you keep it so
[04:27] popular on your bio?
[04:30] Well, first of all, you know, if you
[04:33] understand the potential of Bitcoin,
[04:36] then you understand that if it works
[04:40] where we're going, we our monkey brains
[04:42] can't understand that. So, I just think
[04:45] it's actually the easiest win ever,
[04:47] right? Like I can't believe that
[04:48] Bitcoiners are just giving me this. I
[04:50] can be the no one is bullish enough guy.
[04:52] Um, when it's actually like the easiest
[04:54] thing ever to say about Bitcoin. Uh, and
[04:57] I guess let me just explain it. If you
[04:59] think about Bitcoin in terms of
[05:01] outcomes, I think you can boil it down
[05:03] to three logical outcomes. And I've
[05:05] talked about this on a lot of podcasts,
[05:07] but those logical outcomes are Bitcoin
[05:10] fails, Bitcoin is just another asset,
[05:13] which it is the current status quo. We
[05:15] live in a world of assets. Bitcoin is
[05:16] just another asset. or Bitcoin is the
[05:19] denominator. Bitcoin is what we say it
[05:21] is. It's a paradigm shift, if you will,
[05:25] in monetary technology and the world
[05:29] shifts from a chaotic fiat system to an
[05:33] intelligent Bitcoin system. Like that is
[05:35] like paradigm number three. So if you
[05:40] think about what our predictions need to
[05:43] be based off of, it's either those three
[05:45] outcomes, right? It doesn't really make
[05:47] sense to think about to say I believe in
[05:51] hyper bitcoinization and then predict
[05:53] like million-dollar bitcoin in a hundred
[05:55] years. Like those things don't mix. It's
[05:58] either I believe Bitcoin is just another
[06:00] asset and then there's a whole host of
[06:02] questions and things that you need to
[06:04] consider if like that is the long-term
[06:06] implications of what Bitcoin is. you
[06:08] know, like does the security budget make
[06:10] sense if Bitcoin is just an asset and
[06:12] it's going to be only used by a niche
[06:14] group or it's going to be financialized
[06:16] and and abstracted away? Yeah, I mean
[06:19] those might be legitimate questions, but
[06:22] security budget questions and price
[06:25] questions if hyper Bitcoinization
[06:27] happens, if Bitcoin becomes the
[06:28] denominator, like those are stupid
[06:30] questions. Like why even freaking
[06:32] consider that? Like of course there's
[06:34] going to be plenty of security budget,
[06:36] you know, uh it doesn't matter if the
[06:38] block reward splits in half every four
[06:40] years because the price only has to
[06:42] outpace that and it will continue to pay
[06:44] out the security budget. Like that's
[06:46] really easy logic to think through.
[06:48] Okay. Well, if Bitcoin becomes the
[06:49] denominator, then price should more than
[06:51] outpace, you know, the having schedule.
[06:53] And if Bitcoin does become the
[06:55] denominator, then there should be
[06:57] insanely high fees to use the base
[06:59] network because all economic activity is
[07:02] at some point settling on the base
[07:03] network. So like these things aren't
[07:05] going to be a problem. So why am I
[07:07] talking about all these things? Well,
[07:10] you know, um I think that scenario
[07:12] number three is the most likely. And if
[07:14] Bitcoin truly is a paradigm shift, then
[07:17] no one in the other paradigm can be
[07:20] optimistic enough about the new
[07:21] paradigm. It's it and that that's a fact
[07:25] because none of us are smart enough to
[07:27] think about what is possible when the
[07:28] impossible is possible. That's what new
[07:30] paradigms do, right? So, let me give you
[07:32] an example about a paradigm shift that's
[07:34] happened in the past. Okay? Well, you
[07:37] could argue argue that electricity was a
[07:40] paradigm shift. Okay? Well, in the world
[07:43] before electricity, there's lots of FUD
[07:45] about what electrification would look
[07:47] like. So, like there's a lot of fear.
[07:49] There's like this propaganda of like
[07:51] people being electrocuted on their
[07:52] horse, you know, and all this kind of
[07:54] crazy stuff. But no one really realized
[07:56] that electricity existing equaled open
[07:58] heart surgery. That electricity existing
[08:01] equal going to the moon. That
[08:02] electricity existing equaled
[08:04] international communication networks uh
[08:06] and the internet and me and you being
[08:08] able to do this call over, you know, in
[08:11] real time when we're geographically in
[08:13] completely different places. No one was
[08:15] bullish enough on electricity. maybe
[08:17] Nicola Tesla, but that was just one.
[08:19] Okay, here's another example of a
[08:21] paradigm shift. Another example of a
[08:22] paradigm shift is uh antibiotics being
[08:24] invented. Well, I don't know if you know
[08:27] this antibiotics very very important
[08:29] medical uh tool. Well, prior to
[08:32] antibiotic uh lots of bacterial related
[08:35] diseases killed people. Doing surgeries
[08:38] was very difficult because it was
[08:39] difficult to have a sterile enough uh a
[08:43] sterile enough environment to you know
[08:45] cut the body open do surgeries is much
[08:47] much more risky and on top of that when
[08:50] you know uh the current like the the
[08:53] medical establishment at the time
[08:55] rejected antibiotics. They're like this
[08:58] is snake oil like this is not going to
[09:00] work like this isn't uh this doesn't do
[09:03] anything. Um and shortly after you know
[09:07] now like the term panacea means it
[09:09] solves everything. Panacea was the first
[09:11] antibiotic that was really like
[09:13] introduced into the market. So it it
[09:15] shows that like okay one if it is a
[09:18] paradigm shift it's going to be rejected
[09:19] by the experts. Two it's going to if it
[09:22] is a paradigm shift it's going to unlock
[09:24] a world of possibilities that were not
[09:26] possible before. And then three, people
[09:29] living in the old paradigm will not be
[09:31] able to understand what the new paradigm
[09:34] is going to like like what the
[09:35] implications of the new paradigm is
[09:37] going to bring. So now like let's apply
[09:39] that to Bitcoin. Okay. Well, if Bitcoin
[09:43] fails, it fails. If Bitcoin is another
[09:45] is just another asset, which is the
[09:46] status quo, you know, this doesn't apply
[09:48] to that. But Bitcoin is a paradigm shift
[09:50] in monetary communication in monetary
[09:53] medium and how the world works in how
[09:55] value is stored. If Bitcoin demonetizes
[09:58] gold, demonetizes real estate, all of
[10:00] these things that Bitcoin maximalists
[10:02] say it will do, then what that means is
[10:05] that no one understands what that is
[10:07] going to unlock in the future. And no
[10:09] one can be bullish enough on what that
[10:11] is going to look like. And then so if we
[10:13] apply that to Bitcoin economics and
[10:15] Bitcoin price and all that stuff, like
[10:17] it should make your make your brain
[10:18] explode. Um, but like no one's talking
[10:22] about it that way today still. Maybe
[10:23] Jeff Booth. There's a few people that
[10:25] are like kind of talking about like
[10:27] this, but very few people are talking
[10:29] about like this. People are usually
[10:31] talking about it in the frame of
[10:33] Bitcoin's another asset. And we're going
[10:35] to talk about it denominated in USD. And
[10:37] we're going to talk about it in
[10:39] projections into the future and all
[10:41] these kind of like things that are much
[10:42] more focused around not Bitcoin a
[10:45] paradigm shift, but Bitcoin in the
[10:47] current status quo. So, I know that was
[10:48] a big rambling. I know that you want to
[10:50] jump in. Uh but yeah, that's that's why
[10:53] I think no one is bullish enough.
[10:56] There's a lot of uh really interesting
[10:58] uh things in that that I want to go off.
[11:00] Um but I do agree like I think even
[11:03] Bitcoiners a lot of Bitcoiners are not
[11:05] bullish enough especially long term.
[11:07] They they somes overestimate what we can
[11:09] do in the short term like oh like we're
[11:10] going to a million this year like I
[11:12] don't know if if this actually happens.
[11:14] Um but then they underestimate uh in 10
[11:17] years, in 20 years, in 50 years what the
[11:19] potential of of Bitcoin really is and
[11:22] what the like the total addressable
[11:24] market for me is in Bitcoin not even
[11:28] capped because maybe we discover other
[11:31] planets, maybe aliens come, maybe maybe
[11:33] I don't know like AI bots are all using
[11:36] Bitcoin. This just like triples and
[11:38] quadruples the the whole market. Yeah. I
[11:40] mean look there's a lot of ways that if
[11:42] Bitcoin is a paradigm shift that the
[11:44] price is going to go crazy because one
[11:46] it's a fixed supply uh and it is known
[11:49] and then two uh you know it is going to
[11:53] like the buying power is going to be a
[11:55] metric that is a derivative off of human
[11:58] productivity right so if human
[12:01] productivity in a hundred years is a
[12:04] 1000x on what is possible today like how
[12:06] do you price that in today in Bitcoin
[12:08] terms it's really hard to do that. Um,
[12:11] and what I'm saying is it's actually not
[12:14] crazy talk. Like let's just go backwards
[12:16] 95 years. We can do that. We can think
[12:19] about what the world was like. Okay, how
[12:21] many people then could have thought
[12:23] about what is possible today and what
[12:25] the actual productivity of the humanity
[12:27] is going to be like today. I don't think
[12:29] anyone no one 95 years ago was able to
[12:32] project the future productivity let
[12:34] alone like with Bitcoin as like a new
[12:38] kind of piece into that puzzle.
[12:40] Absolutely. It's it's also interesting
[12:43] or actually I'm wondering a lot about
[12:46] that why the status quo never sees a
[12:49] paradigm shift happening and there's
[12:51] like with electricity but maybe let's
[12:53] let's take a a fun more recent example
[12:56] with Steve Palmer I think he was CEO at
[12:59] that time of of of
[13:01] Microsoft and this clip you probably
[13:03] seen it it's it's very famous clip where
[13:05] he's laughing at the iPhone of the
[13:08] introduction of the iPhone who is paying
[13:09] like $500 for like a phone that doesn't
[13:11] even have a keyboard. Something like
[13:12] that, he said. And I'm always like
[13:16] really mind blown how the incumbent
[13:20] system that should have the most
[13:22] information about an industry doesn't
[13:24] see the most significant change of that
[13:28] very industry. It that always just like
[13:32] completely blow blows my mind how people
[13:34] don't see that. I call that proof of
[13:37] paradigm shift. like it's not a paradigm
[13:39] shift unless the incumbents can't see
[13:41] it. And the reality is it's it's very
[13:43] very hard to disrupt yourself. And that
[13:45] was uh really well characterized in a
[13:47] famous book called the or uh in a famous
[13:50] concept called the innovator's dilemma.
[13:52] Um which is like at some point uh you
[13:56] have reached the top of the pyramid and
[13:58] then it's difficult to to innovate
[14:00] because then you would actually have to
[14:03] uh you would have to attack your own
[14:05] business model, right? you'd have to
[14:06] disrupt your own business model. Um, so
[14:09] that's that's the innovator's dilemma is
[14:11] like if your innovation works,
[14:12] eventually you get to the point where
[14:13] you have to innovate against yourself
[14:15] and you can't. And that's where, you
[14:16] know, a a new upstart comes. Um, so if
[14:20] you don't see the denial, if you don't
[14:22] see the disrespect from the existing
[14:25] incumbents, that's it's actually a good
[14:27] sign that it's not that much of a
[14:29] paradigm shift.
[14:32] Um maybe the only example in modern in
[14:37] my memory that is kind of counter to
[14:38] that is like LLMs and AI but maybe we're
[14:43] just later on the adoption cycle of that
[14:45] and that started much earlier and you
[14:49] know like people think like oh like chat
[14:52] GBT like AI like everyone accepts that
[14:56] this is going to change the game like we
[15:00] like that can still be Bitcoin maybe in
[15:02] 10 years, right? Maybe like it will
[15:04] become ubiquitous that Bitcoin is what
[15:05] we all think it is going to be in 10
[15:07] years. There was a period in even the
[15:10] LLM like cycle where look it was only
[15:12] really the cutting edge like AI
[15:14] researchers who are like this is going
[15:16] to be something like there's something
[15:17] here. Um so yeah, I would actually say
[15:20] like yeah like without the doubt like
[15:23] it's not going to be a paradigm shift
[15:24] without the denial from the existing
[15:26] it's not going to be a paradigm shift.
[15:28] Um it's that it's almost like proof of
[15:30] paradigm. There was this fun moment with
[15:33] Il Musk and Czechm I think was was the
[15:36] name the Alibaba founder uh who were
[15:39] asked on stage and Czechm said basically
[15:42] oh no um I think AI will never be more
[15:46] intelligent than any human being and
[15:48] Elan M next to him just laughed at him.
[15:52] Uh that was fun. Maybe that's like one
[15:54] example how uh someone that actually
[15:56] should get technology in and those
[15:58] things obviously underestimated uh AI.
[16:02] But it's interesting with this
[16:04] innovators dilemma. Do you think there
[16:06] there might be another innovation to
[16:09] money outside of Bitcoin? I don't know
[16:11] like thousands years down the road. I
[16:13] mean impossible to look forward but uh
[16:15] do you think Bitcoin might be the final
[16:17] money? It does like it doesn't have to
[16:18] be. Um, you know, I think that we should
[16:21] always have the door should always be
[16:23] open for real innovation that disrupts
[16:26] Bitcoin, but I just don't see that in
[16:28] the altcoin ecosystem today. And I don't
[16:32] see that, you know, I don't see that
[16:34] emerging out of the fiat world. Like I
[16:36] think like if that does emerge, it's
[16:38] actually out of like the post hyper
[16:39] bitcoinization world, right? Where it's
[16:42] like, okay, it's going to be Bitcoin,
[16:44] you know, bu building off of Bitcoin.
[16:45] there's going to be another unlock and
[16:47] maybe we have another way. Um, you know,
[16:49] if we become multilanetary, there's a
[16:52] lot of arguments to to say that like
[16:55] from a physics perspective, the way that
[16:57] Bitcoin is designed, like it can only
[17:00] really work in a sovereign way, you
[17:02] know, within Earth's orbit unless the
[17:04] center of hash moves, right? So, like
[17:07] it's kind of crazy to think about like
[17:09] what happens if most of the mining is
[17:10] not even happening on Earth. like we're
[17:12] very far away from that and we're very
[17:14] far away from things improving on
[17:17] Bitcoin as sound money in the digital
[17:19] age. Um but yeah, I mean I think if you
[17:22] look at the current
[17:24] ecosystem, it's Bitcoin. Like there's
[17:26] nothing else uh to take super seriously.
[17:29] And I came to that conclusion really
[17:31] fast on my end, you know, like some
[17:34] people like go through their own like
[17:35] Bitcoin crypto shitcoin journey. Like
[17:38] for me it was like crypto. I started
[17:41] researching oh Bitcoin maximalism like
[17:44] it it was like that is the logical uh
[17:46] that's the logical interpretation of
[17:48] what's happening here. So I came to that
[17:49] conclusion really fast
[17:51] myself. There's one guy because you just
[17:53] mentioned it that I think till now was
[17:56] for me the most bullish one on my show.
[17:58] He said one Satoshi will buy you a
[18:00] spaceship. And then he had this crazy
[18:03] theory that Bitcoin mining will actually
[18:06] uh get 99 whatever% of all the energy
[18:11] consumed because we will have some so
[18:13] much abundant energy that the only
[18:15] logical thing is to put it somewhere
[18:17] where it's useful outside of the the
[18:19] thing we're already using it for. and he
[18:21] had the theory that we build solar
[18:23] panels around Mercury to capture the
[18:27] energy of the the sun and and do it.
[18:29] It's it's it's mind it's mindbending
[18:32] those ideas.
[18:34] Yeah. Look, uh science fiction is
[18:36] probably the only place where people
[18:37] like grocked where we're going. Um so
[18:40] I'm sure science fiction is, you know,
[18:42] where the creativity that's going to
[18:44] inspire the future is going to emerge in
[18:46] the future. Gosh, that was probably a
[18:48] really weird statement. Um, yeah. In
[18:51] terms of like the mo most bullish way
[18:53] that I can think of articulating the
[18:55] future is I one sat equals a spaceship.
[18:58] That's that's more bullish than me. What
[19:00] I've been saying is I I've anchored to
[19:03] the block reward in 95 years as that's
[19:06] 37 sats. Um, and I've been saying 37 SAS
[19:11] is going to be generational wealth based
[19:13] off of the assumption that uh we will be
[19:16] able to have more energy and more uh
[19:20] hashes than we can comprehend in 95
[19:23] years. And if it is uh used to capture
[19:25] those 37 sats that in today today's
[19:28] terms 37 sats will be generational
[19:30] wealth. Oh gosh. Uh I love I love that.
[19:33] You're definitely more bullish than me.
[19:34] I have I have to work on that.
[19:38] Well, look look what I would say is
[19:39] Robin is like Bitcoin is either a
[19:42] failure, the status quo or a paradigm
[19:45] shift. If it's a paradigm shift, I'm
[19:46] it's not crazy talk to say in 95 years
[19:49] everything will be different. That's
[19:50] actually the logical way to assume a
[19:53] paradigm shift is going to happen.
[19:54] There's actually a book written about
[19:56] this. It's called the structure of
[19:58] science. And in the the book it it says
[20:01] there's normal science that's science
[20:03] that's within the paradigm and then
[20:04] there's a paradigm shift which changes
[20:07] science and then there's new normal
[20:09] science built on that paradigm and then
[20:10] a paradigm shift. So like and these
[20:14] paradigms like on a time horizon like
[20:17] they they pretty much happen on these
[20:19] like 195 year like these these things
[20:22] happen like that. So, you know, looking
[20:26] back 95 years and then trying to project
[20:27] into the future 95 years, it should give
[20:29] you a nice blueprint of how like you
[20:33] should be trying to project like what
[20:35] the outcome is going to be. And unless
[20:37] like there's some crazy plague or like a
[20:39] crazy solar flare or AI destroys our
[20:42] ability to continue to progress and we
[20:44] go back to the stone age, like my
[20:46] assumption is we're going to have more
[20:47] energy. We're going to have more hashes.
[20:49] And if Bitcoin is the denominator, then
[20:51] the economics are going to be wild. It
[20:53] it's it's I think why is it so hard for
[20:56] the human brain to comprehend those
[20:58] exponential growth things and this
[20:59] paradigm shifts like you you probably
[21:01] have gotten question that I don't know I
[21:05] don't know why I can gro it either
[21:07] honestly like I don't know why for me it
[21:09] seems obvious and for most people it's
[21:11] like crazy talk maybe like not enough
[21:13] people have read structure of science um
[21:16] but like again like being stuck in
[21:18] normal science versus the structure of a
[21:21] paradigm like it It's very logical to
[21:24] like be in a paradigm and build on that
[21:26] paradigm. Like think of like okay you
[21:29] grow up you get an education you go
[21:31] follow a specific career like all of
[21:34] that is built on like
[21:35] one way the world works. It is very hard
[21:39] to you know like if you were to like be
[21:42] a kid and your your parents were to give
[21:43] you advice on what to do they'd say be
[21:45] an engineer, be a doctor, be a lawyer
[21:47] because these are the ways that you can
[21:48] ensure you're going to have wealth in
[21:50] the way that the world works today. It's
[21:52] very difficult for them, you know, to go
[21:54] to a kid and be like, do something
[21:55] crazy, you know, you know, go all in on
[21:58] this type of a thing. Um, because that
[22:01] requires like the vision of where the
[22:03] world is going. Um, and that's just not
[22:06] really like how humanity works. And and
[22:08] also the world doesn't shift all the
[22:10] time. Most of the time it's kind of like
[22:13] here's an existing paradigm. So people
[22:15] the incentive is for people to be within
[22:18] the paradigm. um that is like how we all
[22:21] kind of operate.
[22:23] What do you think are the craziest
[22:25] um implications of that paradigm shift
[22:28] that that you can think of now? So my
[22:30] boss Alex Gladstein, he has this concept
[22:34] uh where he calls Bitcoin a Trojan horse
[22:37] for freedom. Um so the concept is that
[22:42] dictators and purely economic actors are
[22:44] going to adopt Bitcoin because of
[22:47] financial reasons out of uh wanting to
[22:50] have a gain. Uh and there's going to be
[22:53] uh like the unintended side uh
[22:56] consequence of like everyone who's
[22:58] around that is going to become more free
[23:01] and more sovereign and more able to uh
[23:04] control their wealth and control their
[23:05] destiny. Um so I firmly believe in that.
[23:09] I think that Bitcoin really aligns
[23:11] incentives on that is you know you will
[23:13] adopt it for the gains and you know you
[23:16] will become more free and be happy
[23:17] because of it. Um so like how is that
[23:21] going to change what the world looks
[23:23] like? I really like the book the
[23:24] sovereign individual. I read it back in
[23:27] 2019 uh before COVID and I feel like
[23:30] that is a really first principles uh
[23:33] book that is
[23:36] uh very directly correct on how it's
[23:39] predicting the future and I like I love
[23:41] the books that are like relevant to
[23:43] Bitcoin that are written before Bitcoin.
[23:45] So, sovereign individual is one of these
[23:47] books published in 1997. Uh it predicts
[23:51] COVID lockdowns. It predicts digital
[23:54] hard currency outside the reach of the
[23:56] state. Now we know that as Bitcoin and
[23:58] cryptocurrency. Uh it predicts the
[24:01] economy moving online when that
[24:03] prediction was a crazy idea back in the
[24:05] '90s. And you know if it was published
[24:06] in '97 that means it was written before
[24:08] 97. Uh which means that they were
[24:10] thinking about it you know in the early
[24:11] 90s or before. So these people were very
[24:14] very forward thinking. Uh Lord Reese Mog
[24:17] and uh I forget the other guy's name.
[24:19] One second. I'm going to look right now.
[24:20] I got a copy of it right here. Um, but
[24:23] yeah, James Dale Davidson and Lh Lord
[24:26] William Reese Mog, not easy to remember.
[24:30] Um, yeah, so like they were very very
[24:32] directly correct uh on where this is
[24:34] going and they predict that, you know,
[24:37] people are going to have more
[24:38] sovereignty. They predict that there's
[24:39] going to be 100 million sovereign
[24:41] individuals. So that's bullish. Well,
[24:43] there's only 21 million Bitcoin. Um but
[24:46] these sovereign individuals are going to
[24:48] like have sovereignty over themselves
[24:50] like no no entity will be above them in
[24:53] terms of their ability to control their
[24:54] future and they also predict that uh the
[24:58] map is going to break down into smaller
[25:01] jurisdictions and those jurisdictions
[25:03] will be competitive with each other. So
[25:05] like hey you're an Austrian I'm American
[25:07] you know that's not very competitive.
[25:09] It's hard for me to change
[25:10] jurisdictions. uh it's hard for me to
[25:12] take my assets, my identity, my my uh
[25:15] credentials with me. They they predict
[25:18] all that goes away and there's going to
[25:19] be heavy jurisdictional competition and
[25:23] that people will have a lot of choice
[25:25] where which jurisdiction they want to be
[25:27] in. Uh and that is going to create
[25:30] better outcomes for people. So, I mean,
[25:33] I think that they're probably going to
[25:34] be right. I see that happening. You
[25:36] know, not all of their predictions are
[25:38] correct. Um, but I definitely think it's
[25:41] a really good framework to try to think
[25:42] through like what does the digital
[25:44] revolution look like? Let's take a break
[25:46] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[25:49] that Coin Vigilante has made with the
[25:52] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[25:55] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[25:58] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[26:01] and Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[26:03] completely new and amazing Genesis
[26:06] edition of their watch collections. You
[26:09] have the date of the first ever minded
[26:12] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[26:14] also the block height and which epoch we
[26:17] are currently in. I love the level of
[26:20] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[26:23] Make sure to check out those amazing
[26:25] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[26:28] descriptions. I love those watches. so
[26:31] so much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[26:34] really do hope that you don't have it on
[26:36] exchange. But if you do have it on
[26:38] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[26:40] deal with that. The first way is you put
[26:42] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[26:44] entry for you to get into the
[26:47] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[26:50] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[26:53] super simple and secure way. And if you
[26:56] check out the link in the description,
[26:58] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[27:01] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[27:04] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[27:07] partner in terms of how to get the most
[27:10] out of your sovereignty. They will
[27:12] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[27:15] that is perfect for your individual
[27:18] situation. They will show you how you
[27:20] can secure your own devices. Securing
[27:23] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[27:25] have to keep all your devices secure.
[27:28] One topic that is overlooked often is
[27:30] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[27:33] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[27:36] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[27:38] place already? And last but not least,
[27:40] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[27:42] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[27:45] plan B for all that. Head over to the
[27:50] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[27:53] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[27:56] be for the first time ever speaking at
[27:58] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[28:01] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[28:03] really looking forward to seeing all of
[28:05] you there. You can get your ticket in
[28:08] the link down in the description of
[28:10] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[28:12] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[28:16] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[28:18] there. It it always amazes me when when
[28:20] I think now like Black Rock and America
[28:23] are adopting Bitcoin and that's the very
[28:25] thing that will kind of rip away their
[28:28] their power that they they once have.
[28:31] It's it's interesting to think about
[28:33] that. Yeah. The Trojan horse for
[28:34] freedom, man. It's a good thesis for by
[28:36] by Gladstein for sure. Absolutely. Um
[28:39] you mentioned also Jeff Puven and
[28:41] there's there's one thing that uh I'm
[28:43] I'm curious how you think about that. He
[28:46] he he said in the last podcast I did
[28:48] with him the second round was if Bitcoin
[28:51] fails as a medium of exchange it will
[28:52] also fail as a store of value. Uh do you
[28:55] do you agree with that? Yeah look I I
[28:57] think that like the is Bitcoin a medium
[29:00] exchange unit of account these kind of
[29:02] things like these are is Bitcoin an
[29:04] asset conversation. So if we have a an
[29:08] idea of like is bitcoin just another
[29:10] asset like you know where can it fail
[29:13] then yeah I agree that like if bitcoin
[29:16] stays as a financialized asset that's
[29:18] just a savings vehicle it is unclear how
[29:23] it will continue to compete into the
[29:24] future but that's not my base case you
[29:28] know my base case is that uh bitcoin is
[29:30] a paradigm shift and like concerns
[29:33] around like is bitcoin a medium exchange
[29:35] is bitcoin going to be a unit of
[29:37] account. Like these concerns are really
[29:40] just a symptom of us being in the
[29:42] extreme early adopter phase of this
[29:45] paradigm shift. So like I'm not that
[29:48] concerned. You know, I would say it's
[29:51] better to hedge
[29:53] uh the possibility that Bitcoin is just
[29:55] an asset or that Bitcoin is uh is going
[29:58] to fail than it is to like worry about
[30:00] it, right? Just hedge, right? like
[30:04] either Bitcoin's going to succeed or
[30:06] it's probably going to fail. So like you
[30:08] probably need some guns and bullion and
[30:10] you know a couple of like extra
[30:12] passports and some other considerations
[30:14] in that future. Like it's yes, I'm sure
[30:18] there are things that we can do to
[30:19] advance Bitcoin to ensure that it that
[30:23] it succeeds, right? But those incentives
[30:25] exist everywhere. There's 8 billion
[30:27] people on the planet. So those
[30:28] incentives aren't just you. Although,
[30:30] you know, obviously you can be the
[30:32] change you want to see in the world, but
[30:34] everyone can be the change they want to
[30:35] see in the world with Bitcoin. Like
[30:36] that's the beautiful thing about
[30:37] Bitcoin. So, I think like if Bitcoin
[30:40] truly is a paradigm shift, like these
[30:42] these things aren't issues per se. So,
[30:45] you look for the base case of Bitcoin
[30:48] even beyond money because like of
[30:50] exchange, unit of account, uh store
[30:52] value, there's like the attributes of
[30:54] money. So your base case is basically
[30:58] even beyond it being the money of our
[31:01] society. I would say like it's
[31:02] impossible for there to be hyper
[31:04] bitcoinization and for us to think in
[31:07] fiat still right and like isn't that
[31:10] isn't that Jeff Boo's thesis is that we
[31:14] have exponential technologically enabled
[31:18] uh uh uh what's it called?
[31:21] uh not uh not inflation but uh
[31:26] disinflation or uh deflation, right? So
[31:29] technologically uh you know
[31:31] exponential deflation created by created
[31:34] by our gains and efficiency. We need
[31:37] money that maps to that, right? So like
[31:40] I think that Bitcoin literally maps to
[31:43] the world better. Like uh a great saying
[31:46] that I love is by a thinker in Bitcoin,
[31:48] an OG. His name is Nolan Bowley on
[31:51] Twitter, Count BTC, someone who you
[31:53] should definitely interview. He's a
[31:54] genius. Uh but you know, his whole like
[31:56] his handle count BTC is based on this
[31:59] idea like Bitcoin is money you can
[32:00] count. Like how many dollars are there,
[32:02] Robin? Not even not even Jerome Powell
[32:05] knows. So the high priests of fiat don't
[32:07] know how many dollars there are. I can
[32:09] tell you anyone can tell you how many
[32:10] Bitcoin there are. Bitcoin is money you
[32:12] can count. It's already exponentially
[32:13] better. So like yeah, I think it's going
[32:15] to be a unit of account because you can
[32:17] you can count it, dude. Like the other
[32:19] things you can't count like it like the
[32:21] high priest of fiat don't understand it.
[32:24] Like yes, I think Bitcoin is going to
[32:25] disrupt the religion of fiat. I think
[32:28] that the thing that is built off of
[32:30] nothingness and violence is going to be
[32:32] disrupted by math and science. That's
[32:34] not that crazy. I don't think it's that
[32:37] crazy. Um like I actually think like
[32:39] this is the logical way to look at it.
[32:41] like looking at it like is unit of
[32:43] account gonna work? That's so dumb. Buy
[32:47] a gun, buy some swords, learn craft
[32:50] maga. Like if you don't think unit of
[32:52] account is going to work, like figure
[32:53] out another solution, you know? Um like
[32:57] don't worry about it. Like either
[32:59] Bitcoin's going to work or you're going
[33:00] to need to find another solution, but
[33:02] like some effort we take is not going to
[33:05] change the destination of Bitcoin. I
[33:07] love that. And by the way, maybe I just
[33:09] I just search it for for the people that
[33:11] that are wondering. I had Nolan on on my
[33:13] show recently, actually, just two weeks
[33:15] ago. Uh and uh that's it for people. Uh
[33:20] yeah, it was a really nice episode. I I
[33:22] loved it a lot. So that's the for for
[33:24] people wondering, they they can just go
[33:26] there. Uh and yeah, it's it's uh it's
[33:28] it's really
[33:30] interesting talking with you, man. Um, I
[33:33] always say as long as we can still buy
[33:36] Bitcoin because we I get that a lot like
[33:38] like are we still early to Bitcoin, we
[33:41] aren't we late? And I always say and I'm
[33:44] curious how how you think about that. As
[33:46] long as we can still buy Bitcoin with
[33:48] fiat, we are early. Like as long as
[33:50] Bitcoin still has a fiat price because
[33:52] there's still fear around. I think we
[33:54] are kind of sense early. How do you look
[33:57] at that? Yeah, totally agree. I would
[33:59] say like nothing is a tell that someone
[34:02] is has a fiat mindset or someone has
[34:05] Bitcoin is an asset mindset. Um than
[34:08] them saying something like oh we've
[34:10] crossed the paradigm already. What what
[34:12] that shows to me is they confuse brand
[34:16] recognition of Bitcoin because everyone
[34:18] Bitcoin is a household name already but
[34:21] they confuse that with adoption.
[34:23] But if you actually like count adoption
[34:27] by any way that you can measure it, like
[34:30] we're less than 0.01% global adoption of
[34:33] Bitcoin. The metric I like to think
[34:35] about it is is is how many people have
[34:40] taken self- custody or can take
[34:43] self-custody and then abstain. Right? I
[34:46] think like it is logical that you are
[34:48] capable of taking self- custody but you
[34:49] want to use a bank. That's that's fine.
[34:51] But you can take self- custody. But if
[34:53] you have a Coinbase account and you
[34:55] think that's the same as Bitcoin, like
[34:58] that's not adoption. That's not custody.
[35:01] Um, so that's that's the way I like to
[35:04] like measure adoption. I think that
[35:06] we're at less than
[35:07] .001% adoption. I think like you know
[35:11] less than you know a million people on
[35:13] the planet probably are like using this
[35:15] thing in like any capacity that is going
[35:18] to be look like the way it's going to
[35:20] look work natively in the future. Um and
[35:23] there's 8 billion people on the planet.
[35:25] So you do the math like you can divide
[35:27] those things. We're not like if you look
[35:29] at any of these like scurve of adoption
[35:31] or bell curve of adoption you know uh
[35:34] crossing the chasm is like 12% adoption
[35:37] 15% adoption 20% adoption we're at less
[35:41] than we're at less than 0001% adoption.
[35:45] So like how are we crossing the chasm
[35:47] and how are we late? So yeah, you could
[35:49] say if you can if you can buy with fiat
[35:52] you're early. That's a pretty good
[35:53] that's probably a pretty reasonable way
[35:55] to like think about how early we are.
[35:57] Um, but yeah, I I think that when we get
[35:59] to the point where there's more
[36:01] liquidity in the Bitcoin system than the
[36:02] fiat system, that's that is the
[36:05] inflection point. That's where we go
[36:06] from early majority to late
[36:09] majority. And, you know, where uh the
[36:12] the gains uh stop being so outsized.
[36:15] But, uh, until then, you know, I think
[36:17] that there's going to be more volatility
[36:19] and that we're so so early and this
[36:21] thing is, you know, this this train is
[36:23] just about to get started. I I love
[36:25] that. And I I
[36:27] I hate that when people say, "Oh, we at
[36:30] three or 4% adoption." And I'm like, "Do
[36:33] you count someone that has $1,000 on
[36:36] Coinbase as someone that like is is
[36:39] adopted now?" Like, that does not make
[36:41] sense. That's That's a weird confused.
[36:45] Like, look, if they can be like, "I'm
[36:47] putting in Coinbase because I don't
[36:48] trust myself. You know, I tried self-
[36:50] custody, but ra really I just have too
[36:52] much wealth and I feel more comfortable
[36:53] with Coinbase. and I lock down my
[36:55] account. Okay, I count that. But if it's
[36:57] like, oh, my mom has, you know, has
[36:59] Bitcoin on her Coinbase app without
[37:02] two-factor authentication and, you know,
[37:04] she's looking at the dollar price and,
[37:06] you know, waiting when when should I
[37:07] sell it? Like, that's just that's not
[37:09] adoption yet, you know? Uh, that that's
[37:12] that's just early speculation. And,
[37:16] uh, yeah, I mean, there's 8 billion
[37:19] people on the planet. That's like the
[37:20] key here. like we're we're nowhere close
[37:22] to um you know we're nowhere close to
[37:25] 800 million of them like adopting
[37:28] Bitcoin. I don't think we're anywhere
[37:29] close to that. How many people do you
[37:32] think understood Bitcoin on a quite deep
[37:36] deep level?
[37:38] Very small community, man. But you know,
[37:40] I I will tell you um HRF is with the
[37:44] Reynolds Foundation is working with an
[37:47] amazing scholar. Her name is Sarah
[37:48] Kreps. She's a professor at Cornell uh
[37:51] to do a surveying of uh Bitcoin and
[37:55] crypto users in uh authoritarian
[37:58] countries. uh and they're doing, you
[38:02] know, really like legitimate polling
[38:04] using a polling agency and they're doing
[38:06] uh like statistically relevant research
[38:08] on
[38:09] adoption. And one of the really really
[38:12] interesting things that you know uh they
[38:14] started sending to me is that the people
[38:17] who are adopting Bitcoin and stable
[38:19] coins right now in Africa and different
[38:22] places that um struggle with with the
[38:25] problems of fiat a lot more than people
[38:27] in the west do. They're very
[38:29] ideologically
[38:31] aligned, which is surprising because
[38:33] you'd be like, "Oh, Bitcoin is money.
[38:34] Therefore, they're just going to use it
[38:35] because it works." But they're actually
[38:37] doing it because they understand the
[38:39] problem and they understand the
[38:41] solution. So, I think like that is
[38:43] actually another tell that we're super
[38:45] super early because I think that in the
[38:47] future if we've crossed the chasm, those
[38:50] users won't be ideologically aligned.
[38:52] Those users are actually going to just
[38:54] use it because it's more convenient.
[38:56] They're going to use it because this is
[38:57] the best way to send money to their
[38:58] friends, not because fiat is broken and
[39:02] this is my safe haven. This is the only
[39:04] way not to get inflated in my country.
[39:07] Um like that is I like you know that is
[39:10] ideological alignment. So I still think
[39:12] we're in the very early adopter stage
[39:14] where the technology is used by people
[39:16] who deeply understand it. So all the
[39:18] users for now right now like are really
[39:21] really in touch are on the cutting edge
[39:23] or they're on the cutting edge of their
[39:24] community and they're helping their
[39:26] community. That's how uh I think Bitcoin
[39:28] is being used right now. I have a
[39:30] Twitter list where I'm trying to figure
[39:32] out all the the Bitcoiners on on Twitter
[39:35] and just like put them in a list to keep
[39:37] count of that. And there are currently I
[39:38] think like 700 or 800 in in in there and
[39:42] I'm trying to get through that. Uh, so
[39:44] I'm I'm always thinking like, okay, if
[39:46] there's like let's say a thousand people
[39:48] that are known to be Bitcoiners that are
[39:51] kind of good in explaining it and and
[39:53] have a kind of deep understanding, of
[39:55] course, there are different levels to
[39:56] that. Then can there be more than like
[40:00] 100,000 people that actually understood
[40:01] Bitcoin? like like it's really um it's
[40:05] really fun to for me to to think about
[40:07] the small number of people who actually
[40:10] understood Bitcoin because if you go now
[40:12] on the street and just ask a thousand
[40:14] random strangers I don't know how many
[40:16] Bitcoiners you you get there uh who
[40:18] actually understand if you can ask them
[40:20] 10 questions about Bitcoin like 900 of
[40:23] them will not even be able to answer
[40:25] like two questions uh let alone like all
[40:28] all 10 in in a in in a deep way like
[40:31] basic ones It's like what's the average
[40:32] block time? Like most most people like
[40:35] block time. What is block time? And
[40:38] look, I don't think that people people
[40:40] will become more Bitcoin literate as it
[40:42] becomes more relevant for them, but not
[40:46] beyond the amount that they need to use
[40:49] know to use the technology. And if our
[40:51] UX improves the way that it should, the
[40:53] way that it needs to for competition,
[40:56] it's it's going it's not going to be
[40:58] very much, right? And you know, a lot of
[41:01] Bitcoiners will say, "Well, that's a bad
[41:02] thing. People need to learn to take
[41:03] responsibility." I agree. But the we
[41:06] already know that the world is going to
[41:07] be full of AI generated scams. So like
[41:11] you either get scammed or you survive.
[41:12] Like that's just the future. So like
[41:15] people will learn responsibility because
[41:17] AI generated intelligent scams are going
[41:20] to be like the that's going to be the
[41:22] basis. That's going to be the baseline.
[41:23] And honestly, like you know, one of
[41:26] Nolan's predictions is that all of us
[41:27] are going to have AI assisted buddy. You
[41:29] know, we're going to have AI buddies
[41:30] that are like our, you know, children
[41:32] and best friends and they're going to
[41:33] it's going to help us navigate the world
[41:35] of AI generated sludge and truth and
[41:38] fiction and all this kind of stuff.
[41:39] Maybe it'll even help us manage our
[41:41] keys. Um, so we I think we're very early
[41:43] in even understanding uh you know, key
[41:45] management and what that looks like in
[41:47] the future.
[41:48] Um, but just to kind of like add one
[41:51] more dot, uh, one more point to, uh, how
[41:55] early we are. You know, we we both agree
[41:58] we're very early, but just to emphasize
[42:00] that we are that early. There's only
[42:02] like, you know, 700 Bitcoiners on your
[42:05] list or whatever, but uh, none of them
[42:07] are bullish enough. So, even the
[42:08] Bitcoiners that we have aren't bullish
[42:11] enough. So, uh, that's how early we are.
[42:14] I love I love that. And by the way, I
[42:17] already have a bit AI body. I talk with
[42:19] one, two, three AIS like almost every
[42:21] day with the voice mode. It it it feels
[42:24] like an assistant, a friend, an parent,
[42:28] like whatever you want to call it in in
[42:31] different situations. I I talk I talk on
[42:34] days more with AI as with any other
[42:38] human being. It might not be healthy. Uh
[42:40] but I do learn a lot from that. I mean,
[42:42] that's that's impressive. I I I would
[42:44] say I am heavily uh adopting AI and LLMs
[42:47] into my workflow. Um but I don't I don't
[42:50] talk to them as more than humans yet.
[42:53] Yeah, I'm I'm I'm crazy.
[42:54] Sorry. Um maybe one last uh topic for
[42:58] the day I want to get in with you
[43:00] obviously is uh what what Bitcoin is
[43:03] doing for human rights. Uh, I mean like
[43:06] you probably get that question a lot,
[43:07] but I think it's an really interesting
[43:09] one which actually isn't talked as much
[43:13] as it should be on on podcast. We talk a
[43:15] lot about price, why we're not bullish
[43:17] enough and stuff like that, but like the
[43:19] human rights aspect is is really
[43:21] interesting. Yeah. I mean, uh, I came
[43:22] for the number go up and be early on
[43:25] something and, uh, I stayed for, you
[43:28] know, the the the freedoms, the human
[43:30] rights, the sovereignty. Um and the
[43:33] reality is uh there's this thing called
[43:35] the golden billion. So the golden
[43:37] billion is a one billion people on earth
[43:39] who live in a democracy who have stable
[43:43] uh fiat and ass and uh assets that they
[43:46] can get exposure to and uh relatively
[43:49] secure property rights. Right? 8 billion
[43:52] people on the planet 1 billion people
[43:54] have that. So that means 7 billion
[43:58] people in the current system are
[44:01] required to not have that so that the 1
[44:03] billion that have it can have it. And
[44:06] you could say, "Oh, well, it's not like
[44:08] that. It's not that clean. It's not that
[44:10] direct." I think it is. It's pretty
[44:12] clear that the fiat dollar system
[44:14] requires that there is harvesting of
[44:18] natural resources in the vast majority
[44:21] of the planet, the global majority, 7
[44:23] billion people, the majority of the
[44:25] south of the planet, a lot of the
[44:27] eastern part of the planet, not in the
[44:30] west sphere, so that the 1 billion
[44:32] people can have their globalization and
[44:35] have their fiat and have their property
[44:37] and have their
[44:38] assets. And that sucks.
[44:41] That's a waste of human
[44:43] potential. Do you truly think that the
[44:46] minds of and the hearts and the muscles
[44:49] of someone born somewhere different that
[44:51] aren't part of the Golden Billion are
[44:53] any less human or any less capable of
[44:55] producing wealth and and prosperity than
[44:59] the people living in the Golden Billion?
[45:01] I mean, we know that that's not true
[45:02] because people immigrate into the West
[45:05] and find amazing success like that.
[45:08] That's the story of my family. Hey, my
[45:09] family immigrated from Egypt. If they
[45:11] didn't immigrate from Egypt, I would not
[45:13] be on this phone call with you. I would
[45:14] not be the director of financial freedom
[45:16] at the Human Rights Foundation. I would
[45:18] not have a tenth of the wealth that I
[45:19] have today, I would actually be
[45:20] suffering through
[45:22] hyperinflation. That's reality. That's
[45:25] how fiat works.
[45:27] So like if we can get if we can build a
[45:30] system that does not require that that
[45:32] has equal access to all 8 billion people
[45:36] and I know that that's hard to say like
[45:38] okay fine we have 5 billion people who
[45:41] have internet access. What if we can get
[45:42] those five billion to have property
[45:46] rights, assets and sound money? What if
[45:49] we could do that? What are the
[45:52] implications for humanity there? both in
[45:54] like the feelgood they have rights they
[45:56] have property they have control of their
[45:58] life but in the prosperity and wealth
[46:02] for people and living standards for
[46:04] people what are the implications of that
[46:06] I think it's just math if we can stop
[46:09] wasting the lives inefficiently of an
[46:12] additional 4 billion people on the
[46:14] planet and make them productive and give
[46:16] them access to wealth and let them live
[46:19] out their full capabilities and
[46:21] dignity that would create an amazing
[46:25] future for humanity. I think that you
[46:27] need money like Bitcoin in order to do
[46:29] that. What's my proof? Well, we've had
[46:31] money not like Bitcoin for the past 35
[46:33] years and we've seen what it produces. 1
[46:35] billion people have it, 7 billion people
[46:37] don't. These are facts. So, um yeah, um
[46:42] I think that Bitcoin is good for
[46:44] humanity because you know, if you want
[46:46] to resist a dictator, what's the first
[46:48] thing they do? Shut off your bank
[46:49] account. What's the next thing they do?
[46:51] they shut off your voice on social
[46:52] media, on the internet. Well, if you
[46:54] don't have digital access of payments
[46:55] and voice, well, you're really severed
[46:58] in your ability to create change in the
[47:01] 21st century.
[47:02] Um, so I mean that's where HF is
[47:05] embracing technology and trying to help
[47:08] people who want to bring property
[47:10] rights, choice,
[47:13] democracy, you know, give them the tools
[47:15] to resist and be sovereign and to uh
[47:19] have a chance at creating that future.
[47:21] Um so yeah I mean again I'm bullish and
[47:25] I think that uh if you go back to the
[47:27] idea of the sovereign individual nothing
[47:31] creates more uh choice for people more
[47:34] opportunity for people than jur
[47:36] jurisdictional competition and the
[47:38] ability to own your wealth and move it
[47:40] across borders. I remember this might
[47:43] sound like a crazy tangent but I was in
[47:45] Cambodia talking to an English expat.
[47:47] you know, this like old 50-year-old guy
[47:49] who's there living cheap, you know, has
[47:51] a couple girlfriends, all this kind of
[47:53] stuff. And he loved gold. He was like
[47:55] one of those types. He's like, "I love
[47:56] gold. Gold's amazing." You know, that
[47:59] when the Jews were escaping uh Germany,
[48:01] they would sew gold into their pants so
[48:03] that way they could take their wealth
[48:04] with them. And I was like, "That's
[48:06] great." You know, Bitcoin, you can just
[48:07] memorize the seed phrase and then leave
[48:09] with it. Bitcoin's information. Like
[48:11] from a uh wealth transportation
[48:14] perspective like it is a massive upgrade
[48:16] on what was possible before what was
[48:18] possible without trust in your own
[48:20] custody like that is it's a complete
[48:22] gamecher. So like what does that mean
[48:24] for all the refugee crisises across the
[48:26] world if people can all of a sudden for
[48:28] the first time in history take their
[48:29] wealth with them right like what does
[48:31] that mean? It it means everything. It
[48:35] means absolutely everything because you
[48:37] know in the past if you know you had to
[48:39] leave where you lived you left your
[48:41] wealth. You had to start over. Like the
[48:44] game changer that is Bitcoin that is
[48:46] money that you can continue to custody
[48:48] with you in digital form in information
[48:50] form across borders by itself is a is a
[48:53] massive massive gamecher with massive
[48:55] massive implications. And that's not
[48:57] even you know that's not even scratching
[48:59] the surface of all the use cases for the
[49:02] humanitarian industry today. the
[49:04] activism uh space today as well as like
[49:08] the future as these tools continue to
[49:10] get adopted. So this is why I love
[49:11] Gladstein's perspective is Bitcoin is
[49:13] actually a Trojan horse for freedom,
[49:15] right? People adopt it because number go
[49:18] up, especially dictators. And what
[49:20] really happens is that freedom goes up.
[49:22] I love that. And you probably have seen
[49:24] uh a lot of the real world examples of
[49:27] the meme fix the money, fix the world.
[49:29] You probably have seen the the the
[49:31] actual implications of of of that that
[49:34] Twitter meme.
[49:36] Yeah. Yeah, I mean look, um, one of the
[49:38] things that HRF and Alex Glastian and
[49:40] our team is doing better than, uh,
[49:43] anyone else, I think, is is telling
[49:45] those stories. Telling the stories of
[49:47] Bitcoin as a tool for freedom, Bitcoin
[49:50] as universal property rights, Bitcoin as
[49:53] universal access to sound money and
[49:55] sound investments. Like what people
[49:57] don't get is like if you live in a place
[49:59] like Palestine, okay, one if you live in
[50:02] Gaza, like you're in the war conditions,
[50:05] but before then you didn't have any
[50:08] assets. The only asset that you could
[50:10] really invest in is real estate. Well,
[50:13] what happened to that? Well, it's not
[50:15] really an asset anymore, unfortunately.
[50:17] And like that's a sad example, but I
[50:19] think it it really shows like like you
[50:22] can have sound assets that are not that
[50:25] can't be bombed necessarily. Um and and
[50:29] you can take with you like it's just
[50:31] it's so so massive. Um and the majority
[50:34] of the planet does not have that. And
[50:36] even in the west, the privileged west,
[50:38] we don't have it to the extent that
[50:39] Bitcoin gives to everyone, right? uh
[50:42] with with our all of the the things that
[50:44] are afforded to us by you know the
[50:46] golden billions privilege we don't even
[50:48] get you know the full level of
[50:50] sovereignty and wealth preservation that
[50:52] Bitcoin offers to every single person
[50:55] that is connected to the internet that
[50:57] has access to the open Bitcoin network
[50:59] like it's it's just like no one is
[51:02] bullish enough on the prospect of this
[51:03] thing being the thing right this thing
[51:06] turning into the base layer not even me
[51:08] like I can't gro it I'm not a genius I'm
[51:10] not Nicola Tesla I'm just all I'm just
[51:13] some idiot that actually is making this
[51:14] observation that like oh if this is a
[51:16] paradigm shift like these are the things
[51:18] to expect. That's it. That's all I'm
[51:20] doing. And yeah, as you said because
[51:22] most listeners here probably are from uh
[51:26] this one billion uh of the of the golden
[51:30] how you said golden uh golden the golden
[51:32] building. The golden billion. The golden
[51:35] billion. Yeah. Um and even those who
[51:37] live like let's say in in a good city in
[51:39] a good country with like a stable
[51:41] democracy with a stable currency kind of
[51:43] stable democracy kind of stable uh
[51:46] currency even those have to pay property
[51:49] taxes on on their the real estate even
[51:52] those uh don't really own the their real
[51:55] estate. They just own it as long as they
[51:58] uh the government lets them own this
[52:00] thing. Uh so it it's really interesting
[52:04] to see even in in the in the highest
[52:06] order of property rights even their
[52:08] property rights aren't really there
[52:11] outside of Bitcoin. I think that's a
[52:14] major thing. And then you look out
[52:15] outside of of that one golden billion of
[52:19] the other 7 billion and you're like oh
[52:21] like it's it's like 100x worse. again
[52:24] like I can't I can imagine very easily
[52:29] where my life would be if my parents did
[52:30] not leave Egypt. I went to Egypt last
[52:32] summer. Like it does not matter how good
[52:36] of a of a business person you are. It
[52:38] does not matter how intelligent you are.
[52:40] It does not matter because you're living
[52:43] in a system that's breaking down. Like
[52:46] you are being held down. And I would not
[52:48] be where I'm at if if I didn't have like
[52:50] the foundation that is afforded to me
[52:52] here in the west. It has nothing to do
[52:55] with my ability.
[52:57] Um what if Bitcoin can spread that to
[53:02] another four billion people, another 7
[53:04] billion people potentially? That's the
[53:06] ultimate TAM. Like what are the
[53:07] implications for that? I mean that's a
[53:10] that's a really beautiful thing to fight
[53:12] for in my opinion. 100% I agree with you
[53:16] here. Um, we have two questions at the
[53:17] end of the podcast. The first question
[53:19] is always the same question and the
[53:21] question is, "What can we learn from you
[53:23] besides Bitcoin?" Oh man. So, what was
[53:25] the first question? What we can learn
[53:27] from you besides Bitcoin? That's the
[53:29] first question. Uh, so I would say like
[53:32] I love Bitcoin. I'm passionate about
[53:33] Bitcoin. Uh, my real skill set is uh is
[53:37] like dealing with people and management
[53:39] and that kind of stuff and organization.
[53:41] Uh so you know maybe in the future I'll
[53:43] I'll write a book about about that. Uh
[53:46] but for now uh yeah you know I think you
[53:50] know Bitcoin's my forte uh and you know
[53:52] just hoping to spread more of these
[53:54] ideas. I think uh there there's a book
[53:56] in the making in terms of uh how to
[53:59] think about Bitcoin uh how to think
[54:01] about paradigm shift etc. So uh yeah
[54:04] that's that's the the Bitcoin and non-
[54:06] Bitcoin part. I'm looking forward to
[54:08] that one. And we have a very uh nice end
[54:11] routine where the previous guest is
[54:13] asking a question for next guest without
[54:14] knowing who the next guest actually is
[54:16] and it it fits nicely. What's the name
[54:19] of the last book you read and why did
[54:21] you read it? Yeah, the the last book I
[54:23] read was the structure of science and I
[54:25] was trying to develop the idea of
[54:27] Bitcoin as a paradigm shift and I was
[54:29] telling someone about it at a retreat
[54:31] that HRF was putting on and she was
[54:33] like, "Oh, there's a book written about
[54:34] that structure of science. Look it up."
[54:35] and I immediately bought it and read it
[54:37] and uh it has enriched my perspective a
[54:40] lot. Really cool. Awesome. Really cool.
