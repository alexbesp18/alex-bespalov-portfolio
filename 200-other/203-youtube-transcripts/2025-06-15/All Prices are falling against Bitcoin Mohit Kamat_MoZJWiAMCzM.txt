[00:00] Bitcoin is a perfect tool to capture the
[00:02] fruit of Labor the bananas the cars the
[00:05] houses whatever you want to buy the
[00:07] price are falling against Bitcoin
[00:09] Bitcoin will actually make you humble
[00:11] Bitcoin is a system that is based on
[00:13] love when the money is fixed I think
[00:16] almost every other puzzle is
[00:18] fixed how did you came into Bitcoin with
[00:22] for in like did you go all in when you
[00:25] came into Bitcoin or like how did this
[00:26] all happen oh well so I'll give you my
[00:29] background so I am a former badminton
[00:32] International badminton is a sport it's
[00:34] an Olympic sport so I'm a former
[00:36] badminton International player uh
[00:38] representing India so I've uh most of my
[00:40] youth has been spent in playing
[00:42] badminton representing country I've won
[00:44] a lot of medals for my country and you
[00:47] know uh in 2015 I I retired from my
[00:50] professional sports and and got into
[00:53] professional coaching where uh in the
[00:55] next four five years I made a a lot of
[00:58] name and uh you know taught a lot of
[01:01] children about my Sport and I have I I
[01:04] own an academy too in 2020 March you
[01:07] know the co during the covid times um
[01:10] everything stopped my income stopped and
[01:13] uh there was nothing to work on
[01:15] everybody were at home and you know at
[01:17] that time we were all hooked up on the
[01:19] digital media right so I just came
[01:22] across uh a video called Bitcoin
[01:25] documentary and I randomly saw it in the
[01:27] night and I was curious to know uh how
[01:30] do people make money what exactly is
[01:33] money until then I I don't have a
[01:35] background of Economics or uh you know
[01:38] stock market nothing you know it's just
[01:40] pure Sports I'm a pure Sportsman and
[01:42] after seeing that video it kind of uh
[01:45] you know built a curiosity in me that
[01:47] you know what exactly is money and I saw
[01:50] one video of uh followed by one video of
[01:53] Michael Sor you know uh Bitcoin is the
[01:57] digital money and it's going to be the
[01:59] future and that's where I got into it
[02:01] and everything followed but you know I
[02:04] was also into the cryptocurrency and I
[02:07] thought why do I buy uh Satoshi or Point
[02:11] Bitcoin in point uh decimals then when I
[02:14] can buy hundreds and thousands of sheay
[02:17] new Bitcoins or probably wink Bitcoins
[02:19] you know that was the uh you know things
[02:22] which was fed to us through Telegram and
[02:24] all so I had my own journey of getting
[02:26] into shitcoins then understanding what
[02:28] exactly is cryptocurrency what is
[02:30] blockchain what is bitcoin why Bitcoin
[02:33] and ultimately now I have understood
[02:35] that you know Bitcoin is something which
[02:38] is totally different and here you go
[02:41] it's fascinating how people discover
[02:44] Bitcoin only I think almost everybody is
[02:46] at some point uh in shitcoins or
[02:50] altcoins or cryptocurrencies outside of
[02:52] Bitcoin but they all come back to
[02:54] bitcoin at some point uh some are like
[02:57] longer there some actually really deep
[02:59] in there but somehow all come back but
[03:02] what I'm really interested with in with
[03:05] you I think Sports is teaching you a lot
[03:08] I also was um on the highest swimming
[03:11] level in Austria like in the Austrian
[03:13] national I was a swimmers uh never got
[03:16] to Olympia never got to bigger events
[03:18] Austrian level was the biggest I got um
[03:21] but I learned a lot uh for life from
[03:24] sport like discipline stuff like that
[03:26] keeping up being consistent um what did
[03:29] like the the badmon sport uh and teach
[03:33] you what you found uh good to learn
[03:37] about Bitcoin and learn about uh also
[03:40] other stuff like coaching uh
[03:42] entrepreneurship what did the sports
[03:44] part teach you in later your
[03:47] life yeah so uh primarily Sports teaches
[03:50] not only me I mean including everyone
[03:52] whoever is getting into sports right
[03:55] there are hundreds of things which you
[03:56] can learn so but there are I would I
[03:58] would uh uh relate to five key learnings
[04:02] I feel Humanity has to learn through
[04:04] sport uh there's one discipline because
[04:08] to achieve anything in life discipline
[04:10] is the first thing if you're not
[04:13] consistent enough disciplined enough I
[04:14] don't think so you can achieve anything
[04:16] greater in life the second one is
[04:18] determination you know you set a goal
[04:21] for yourself and you have to be
[04:22] determined to achieve that consistently
[04:24] go back to that be determined every day
[04:27] have that motivation to get up every day
[04:29] and Chase your goals the third one is
[04:32] persistence you know sorry per
[04:34] perseverance I'm sorry so you have to go
[04:37] back again and again and again and the
[04:39] fourth one is courage and the fifth one
[04:42] to be more creative because everybody
[04:44] plays Sports everybody competes to win
[04:46] that medal or to be become a champion
[04:49] but what separates a champion to others
[04:51] is to be more creative in what he has
[04:55] learned through Sport and this is where
[04:57] I felt when I got connected to bitcoin
[05:01] is you know it's the perfect tool
[05:04] Bitcoin is a perfect tool or you can
[05:06] call it as a perfect instrument to
[05:08] capture the fruit of Labor I'll give you
[05:11] an example so I have won uh around 800
[05:15] medals overall including my state my
[05:18] region my national and total you know uh
[05:22] International to so today after 20 years
[05:26] of my professional sport I have actually
[05:28] nothing to show or to store that you
[05:31] know this is what I have done but when I
[05:33] when when I compare this to bitcoin I
[05:35] felt like okay this is the perfect uh
[05:38] instrument to capture my value which I
[05:41] have you know given every day for 8
[05:44] hours or 9 hours I'm teaching and I'm
[05:46] getting something back and I can store
[05:49] it forever and I can give it to my
[05:52] younger generation and the Next
[05:54] Generation and the Next Generation which
[05:55] is immutable uncon confisa
[06:00] uh you can travel it you can take it
[06:02] with you anywhere in the world I mean
[06:04] it's it's it's beautiful right what do
[06:06] you think yeah it's uh it's I think this
[06:10] the most important thing about Bitcoin
[06:12] uh the aspect that you can store your
[06:15] life's energy in there use you play
[06:17] sports other people are just working
[06:20] some some normal jobs some maybe some is
[06:22] like a doctor maybe like a single like
[06:24] there are so many different shops and
[06:27] what Bitcoin enables us is to not worry
[06:31] about finances after you work like you
[06:34] come home you're maybe a doctor you save
[06:36] life during the day then you come home
[06:38] and you have to be a stock picker you
[06:40] have to be a portfolio manager to keep
[06:44] up with inflation and Bitcoin allows you
[06:47] to just don't worry about that and just
[06:49] get your financial energy put it in
[06:51] Bitcoin and you can store it for uh uh
[06:54] for how long you ever want you can store
[06:57] it for your children you can store it
[06:58] for yourself later in your life and this
[07:00] is uh the the biggest thing that people
[07:03] don't get because they only see the
[07:05] short-term volatility like oh it crashes
[07:07] 10% down oh it got got up 20% how can it
[07:10] be stable how can it store anything but
[07:12] they don't see the long-term vision of
[07:14] it so so why do you think that people
[07:17] don't get it because right now you
[07:18] mentioned that people don't get it the
[07:21] the the Life Energy can be stored in a
[07:23] great way but people don't get it so
[07:25] that's what you mentioned why do you
[07:27] think that people don't get it I think
[07:30] and this
[07:31] is gets back to what people uh cannot do
[07:35] I think right now is critical thinking
[07:38] uh people see and hear stuff and they
[07:41] just believe it and most people are on
[07:43] autopilot because they are in this their
[07:46] Lane they are doing uh whatever they
[07:48] have to do to survive they have a family
[07:50] they have kids they have to do so much
[07:52] stuff they're so involved with their
[07:54] life that they don't even have the time
[07:57] to sit down in a day and read a book for
[07:59] an hour uh the the most people don't
[08:03] have the luxury to think and sit down
[08:06] and like oh what is money actually like
[08:09] this is a luxury uh what people have
[08:11] when they can just sit down and be like
[08:13] let's sit down and enjoy uh a book let's
[08:17] read the Bitcoin standard let's read uh
[08:19] Rich dead pad let's read some of the
[08:22] important books you have to read to
[08:24] understand money and if people cannot do
[08:28] that how can they understand a concept
[08:31] that has been uh fed to them uh that
[08:35] this is actually wrong so I think and
[08:38] this is also a big motivation of my
[08:40] podcast to bring it to as many people as
[08:43] I can I have this goal this year to
[08:46] interview 300 bitcoiners why do I do so
[08:49] many Bitcoin interviews because
[08:51] everybody has something different and to
[08:54] show my girlfriend an interview I will
[08:57] pick something that is suited for her to
[08:59] show my mom an interview I pick
[09:01] something suited for her I can I like I
[09:04] want as many different views on bitcoin
[09:07] as possible because for everyone it's
[09:09] something different like actually for me
[09:11] it was also Michael saor the the big one
[09:13] that got me really deep into Bitcoin it
[09:16] looks like it also was for you but for
[09:19] someone else is saying oh I don't like
[09:21] Mega I'm I'm hating him I I like more
[09:24] the technical guys that are programing
[09:27] on bitcoin so for every is someone
[09:30] different and that's why I want to have
[09:32] as many people on so we can orange peill
[09:36] as many people because it's important
[09:38] that people know about it of course we
[09:40] can just wait like Bitcoin isn't
[09:42] available everybody will get it at some
[09:44] point but it's better we get it faster
[09:47] what do you think about it oh yeah so
[09:50] when you mentioned that um uh not many
[09:53] people sit and just calmly think about
[09:56] what what is money because when I
[09:58] thought about myself when I was 16 year
[10:00] old I was just a monster of energy you
[10:03] know I could I could lift weights around
[10:06] 200 300 pound and I couldn't do so many
[10:08] things I was so energetic I played
[10:10] around you know that energy was kind of
[10:12] unlimited I felt like a Hulk but as now
[10:15] I'm getting older I'm not that old
[10:18] excuse me I'm just 36 but you know the
[10:21] the the body feeling and the energy
[10:22] feeling when you wear at 20 or 25 is not
[10:25] the same when it is 35 or 36 so you kind
[10:28] of lose the energy and when when I
[10:31] compared this with money concept and the
[10:34] Bitcoin how about an idea where the life
[10:37] energy is stored and it always
[10:41] expands you know what I'm uh did you get
[10:44] what I'm saying it's like always
[10:45] expanding the value of Bitcoin is always
[10:48] growing the energy is always
[10:52] growing yeah I think it's even um I mean
[10:55] it's kind of the same result but I see
[10:57] it uh differently because I see Bitcoin
[10:59] as the constant and we are constantly
[11:02] getting better in doing stuff so
[11:05] everything is actually getting cheaper I
[11:07] mean it's the same thing as as as it's
[11:09] just other way of looking at it and I
[11:12] just released yesterday the podcast with
[11:14] Jeff poof and maybe I'm right now in
[11:16] this Jeff poof deflationary mindset uh
[11:19] because it's like money is like constant
[11:21] it should not be manipulated and in that
[11:24] way it's expanding in value so if you
[11:27] keep on it the value is expanding on it
[11:29] uh because the bananas the cars the
[11:32] houses whatever you want to buy the
[11:34] prices are falling against Bitcoin
[11:37] against sound money and people have a
[11:39] hard time understanding that like it's
[11:41] it's so hard to get this inflationary
[11:43] mindset out of out of their minds yes
[11:46] because that system is designed to
[11:48] create artificial value it's always that
[11:51] artificial value is going up that's
[11:53] where I think Bitcoin is an antivirus an
[11:55] antidote for that system where it is
[11:58] actually getting all these things to a
[12:01] right price value why do you think you
[12:03] know Bitcoin is growing and other
[12:05] compared to or pegged to bitcoin the
[12:07] other things are getting devalued
[12:09] because it is trying to make those
[12:11] things humble Bitcoin will actually make
[12:13] you
[12:14] humble yeah it's a it's it's an amazing
[12:18] thing because uh I think Jeff Poof's
[12:21] company is actually called EOD def
[12:23] Capital uh and he also talks a lot about
[12:26] how Bitcoin kills your ego because
[12:29] because most people did not get in in
[12:32] 2009 so most people saw Bitcoin rising
[12:35] up a lot and I I don't know about your
[12:37] story but I I saw Bitcoin from 2017 the
[12:40] first time because I'm right now 25 so
[12:43] 2017 I was really young back then uh was
[12:48] yeah 20 19 something like that uh so it
[12:51] was really early for me to invest in
[12:53] Bitcoin but I saw it rising to like the
[12:56] almost 20,000 then crashing back down
[12:59] and then I did not get in I was uh the
[13:02] 100% sure it's a scam and then in 2020 I
[13:05] got it but but I saw it rising up and I
[13:08] had the opportunity to get so many more
[13:10] Bitcoin at 3,000 5,000 6,000 7,000 and I
[13:15] bought most of my Bitcoin under 10,000
[13:17] but I also bought a lot of my um Bitcoin
[13:20] stack on 60,000 in 2021 when I went
[13:24] actually all in and this is I think a
[13:26] hard thing like when you see it rising
[13:28] and falling you have to get over you and
[13:31] say oh I was wrong and uh now I get
[13:35] into it and I don't care that there's
[13:38] someone inside Bitcoin that is there for
[13:40] five years was earlier clever than me
[13:44] and got it first than me and and
[13:46] benefits from me getting into it later
[13:49] now you have to get over this step and
[13:51] it's hard for a lot of people Journey
[13:55] yeah that's a journey Robin like how we
[13:57] all have gone through our education
[13:58] right so uh four years of University and
[14:01] two years of the university and and
[14:03] that's where you kind of get matured
[14:06] while into that journey and that was
[14:09] also true for me so started with
[14:10] shitcoin and more of shitcoin and more
[14:12] of shitcoin then got into gambling then
[14:15] I understood what the difference between
[14:17] uh shitcoins and Bitcoin so slowly
[14:20] started studying more and more and more
[14:22] and then it's just pure love and that
[14:24] keeps you more humble and why you know
[14:26] the the concept of why Bitcoin there's
[14:29] no second best what Michael saor says
[14:31] right and that's just uh pure genius and
[14:34] you I feel you will also have to have a
[14:37] small understanding of how an economy
[14:39] functions um you know uh how how how uh
[14:44] Commodities are priced how uh how what
[14:47] are securities what is geopolitics if
[14:49] you have a small background in that
[14:50] right it's easy easier for you to
[14:53] understand what exactly is Bitcoin and
[14:54] what is it doing for
[14:56] Humanity yeah and the whole game theory
[14:59] also have to um understand and the
[15:02] psychology behind that what I'm also
[15:04] really interested with you and I don't
[15:07] know how religious you are but most
[15:10] Indians I met they are way more
[15:12] religious than the austrians I'm meet
[15:14] where I'm from and most bitcoiners are
[15:18] me are not not all of them but some of
[15:21] them are really religious and they they
[15:23] have this connection between
[15:25] Christianity and Bitcoin and I never
[15:28] talked with uh I guess you're a Hindu
[15:30] right yeah yeah I never talked with a
[15:32] Hindu do you still you do you also see a
[15:36] connection between religion and Hindu
[15:38] and U Bitcoin I I mentioned it to you
[15:42] before that I have actually an Indian
[15:44] girlfriend so I get also a little bit
[15:46] into this culture
[15:47] because try try to get what she's
[15:50] talking all
[15:52] day but how do you see the connection
[15:54] between religion India and also like the
[15:57] Bitcoin triangle
[15:59] uh well uh I don't think so uh it's
[16:02] connected deeply like that right now but
[16:06] uh I think in in in the next few years
[16:08] people would you know find a
[16:12] um I wouldn't take it as a connection
[16:15] but yes a similarity where where most of
[16:18] it is true you know what makes a
[16:21] religious person that's just a question
[16:24] for you who is a religious person that's
[16:27] a really hard
[16:30] question because I would myself not
[16:33] declare myself a religious person uh but
[16:37] we all think of something bigger than us
[16:39] like we all have some beliefs that
[16:42] there's something bigger than us if you
[16:44] don't have this belief I think you're on
[16:45] a wrong
[16:47] path uh and we all think of something
[16:50] different that's uh like on a a we we
[16:54] and it all comes down from me to values
[16:57] like what values do you believe
[17:00] and they're like different stories with
[17:02] Christianity with Hinduism like there
[17:04] are different stories ingrained in that
[17:07] but if you actually look at what those
[17:10] stories teach us what those values are
[17:13] abstracted from that uh it actually
[17:15] comes down that and there's also the
[17:18] connection between uh what I see with
[17:20] Bitcoin as Chris Christianity and
[17:22] Bitcoin there's some values to it
[17:25] connected and I mean in the end of the
[17:27] day Bitcoin is just money so you we
[17:29] should not uh put Bitcoin in some
[17:31] religious things we should Bitcoin put
[17:33] Bitcoin not in some political thing uh
[17:36] it's just money in the end of the day
[17:38] and actually it's it should actually
[17:41] divide uh everything from money like
[17:44] right now Bitcoin is right now money is
[17:46] involved in in in state in politics
[17:49] because it's it's like kind of a product
[17:51] from politics but we want to have have
[17:53] this separated so I'm also finding it's
[17:56] interesting when people see that
[17:58] connection but uh obviously it's it's
[18:00] it's not uh always connected for me it's
[18:03] not that connected but I'm just was
[18:05] wondering because a lot of Christianity
[18:07] connected with P yeah so in in Hindu
[18:11] there is one um uh in the vas I don't
[18:14] know whether you know or no there are
[18:16] four different holy books uh it's called
[18:19] Vedas in our our religion so in that one
[18:23] of The Vedas they have mentioned that
[18:25] you know there are emotions for human
[18:26] beings it's called ad galus which is
[18:29] which means these are the emotions which
[18:31] can really ruin a human being it's
[18:34] called I'll just mention first with the
[18:36] sanscrit
[18:37] language kha MOA Mada Loa mats there are
[18:42] six different emotions Kama is not
[18:44] exactly uh sex but it's kind of a lust
[18:47] cro is
[18:49] anger uh mother is something which you
[18:51] want more and more it's kind of a greed
[18:54] you know that's an emotion right it's a
[18:55] greed mother is uh attached M sorry MOA
[18:59] is attachment mother is greed matser is
[19:02] something which is you know I want it
[19:05] but I don't want uh you know I want to
[19:08] have more Bitcoin I don't want Robin to
[19:09] have more Bitcoin you get what I'm
[19:11] saying so it's like you know
[19:13] selfishness right so these six emotions
[19:16] if you really see Bitcoin will actually
[19:18] control it you cannot manipulate it you
[19:22] know you can't you know have that anger
[19:24] oh I lost it no even if you stack little
[19:27] Satoshi over a period of time you can
[19:29] have your own Freedom out of it so this
[19:33] is where I see that you can have a
[19:34] connection between human emotions and uh
[19:38] Bitcoin I would put it across this way
[19:40] rather than putting it with religion
[19:43] yeah I think this is a better way to put
[19:44] it like with human emotions and and
[19:46] finding truth and it's also Bitcoin is
[19:48] so hard to everyone because it has like
[19:51] it it treats everyone uh the same
[19:54] everyone has the same rules set you
[19:56] cannot cheat uh if you if if you mess up
[20:00] your private custodial setup you will
[20:03] get rack pulled you will get hacked
[20:05] because people know that there is
[20:07] something uh if if you sell it then it
[20:10] will shoot up 100% and you will have to
[20:13] buy back at more like and this is this
[20:15] is this is also comes back to the yeah
[20:18] to the humble you stuff um and you also
[20:21] wrote a nice tweet I saw it from you
[20:24] where you talked about uh I think how
[20:26] was it the two most cheapest things
[20:30] right now is satoshis and sun and I love
[20:34] that absolutely how can people not get
[20:36] it you know it's it's so cheap solar
[20:39] energy is so cheap you know we are all
[20:41] uh we call it in Hindu U uh sua vamshi
[20:46] which means you know we belong to Sun
[20:48] there are there are organisms in in this
[20:51] planet on this planet which are which
[20:53] belong to Moon energy right like bats
[20:55] you know owls they all get activated in
[20:58] the night and we are like you know solar
[21:00] powered uh beings and know that's cheap
[21:03] that's you you go morning on the Terrace
[21:06] you have that energy and right now if
[21:09] you can stack Satoshi which is hardly
[21:11] less than a scent you cannot imagine how
[21:16] how free you can be in your life in the
[21:18] next 15 to 20 years when it comes to a
[21:20] close to a 10% or 20% adoption so for
[21:23] that that's why I told you you know you
[21:25] need to have a little bit of
[21:27] introduction or a background for
[21:28] geopolitics money economics you know I
[21:32] can't imagine how brilliant Satoshi was
[21:35] whoever that um that being was you know
[21:39] he is brilliant the way he has coded the
[21:42] way he has involved
[21:44] economics um building that scarcity the
[21:47] hash which he has created absolutely
[21:50] genius absolutely genius also the story
[21:53] he has created the origin story that he
[21:55] was never talkx like nobody knows who he
[21:58] is or who she is or who they are it's
[22:01] it's it's an the perfect story for the
[22:05] perfect money I always say it's like you
[22:08] could not do it better if you want to if
[22:11] you if you now and I do this with a lot
[22:13] of people that don't get Bitcoin or or
[22:16] get are against Bitcoin I asked them the
[22:19] question okay what is perfect money for
[22:22] you and I actually did this with um a
[22:26] class like a schools class I was invited
[22:28] to speak somewhere uh in in a university
[22:31] and there were like people between like
[22:33] 20 and 25 so around my age uh and I went
[22:38] uh with them through that thing I was
[22:42] completely interactive I did not give
[22:44] anything out and I asked them okay if
[22:46] you can now create the perfect money
[22:50] what do you want the perfect money to be
[22:53] and after a while we actually came right
[22:56] uh to the properties that Bitcoin has
[22:59] it's like oh I want my money to last
[23:02] long I don't want it to lose energy then
[23:05] I want my money to be accepted
[23:08] everywhere I want to be similar like we
[23:11] we went all to the unit of account Med
[23:13] of Exchange store of value and I just
[23:16] collected them and write them on the
[23:18] paper and then we went through them like
[23:20] we were okay is our stocks good money is
[23:23] our Fe currency good money is Bitcoin
[23:25] good money and we came to the conclusion
[23:28] together
[23:29] that Bitcoin is the perfect money and
[23:31] it's amazing when you ask people what's
[23:33] the perfect money and let's really go
[23:35] through it what what do you want money
[23:37] to be the end conclusion is
[23:40] Bitcoin it's so simple
[23:44] yes so even even um you know the general
[23:47] elections are are about to come for at
[23:50] least in India you know it's in it's in
[23:51] may end of May I think also it is at the
[23:54] same time in us I think in November or
[23:57] is it during October
[23:59] I was thinking um we
[24:04] vote for few people to make our lives
[24:08] better to make our lives in lead in such
[24:12] a way that we have the satisfaction in
[24:15] our old age that yes we have lived a
[24:16] fantastic life but right now if you see
[24:20] the statistics us is under the debt of
[24:23] 34 plus trillion and every hundred for
[24:26] every 100 days 1 trillion has been
[24:29] printing M that means what so they are
[24:33] trying to borrow from the future
[24:35] generation so if I'm a US citizen my
[24:37] children who are never born
[24:40] yet they are directly born into a system
[24:44] which is on the debt and they have to
[24:45] start paying the debt from the day one
[24:47] that's something which is ridiculous and
[24:49] I feel that you know uh when we vote for
[24:51] certain people a group of people will
[24:54] decide what our future is going to be I
[24:56] don't want a future like that and I feel
[24:58] the Gen Alpha and the the generation the
[25:01] last 20 years or 30 years generation has
[25:03] to really stand up and you know uh have
[25:06] to fight for our Liberty and that's what
[25:08] I feel and I think Michael sailor is
[25:10] somewhere trying to lead that and I'm
[25:13] very happy about do you do you see um or
[25:17] how do you see Bitcoin changing politics
[25:20] in the long run like right now it
[25:22] obviously has not a huge impact uh but
[25:25] in like 10 20 50 100 years do you see if
[25:29] we have a sound money system and it gets
[25:32] through the Grassroots movement to to
[25:34] everybody do you see a change in our
[25:37] political system um that's a very tricky
[25:39] question
[25:40] so I would say that uh Bitcoin might not
[25:45] be the ultimate currency for the next
[25:48] 100 to 200 years because we have borders
[25:52] right India is India is a country and we
[25:54] have a border and what happens in that
[25:56] border has to stay in the Border like
[25:58] let's say it's a National Defense so I
[26:00] feel that there will be the governance
[26:02] the governments where the governance is
[26:04] a part right so whatever is locally
[26:08] produced the GDP which happens in the
[26:10] country uh creates a value and that
[26:13] value you know attaching directly to a
[26:15] world Reserve asset like
[26:18] Bitcoin um might be dangerous right now
[26:21] if I feel but if I I will have to study
[26:24] more on that how how how a one currency
[26:27] of the world will govern the entire
[26:30] world different nations different
[26:32] cultures um it's it's difficult to
[26:35] imagine because I stud yeah it's
[26:38] extremely difficult to imagine because
[26:41] um how does government pay for things
[26:43] there's taxes but the most part they're
[26:45] paying actually with printing money if
[26:48] you look like how
[26:49] much like it's depth like if you look at
[26:53] USF government they have uh uh they have
[26:55] a lot of depth uh so
[26:58] where is the step coming from yeah they
[27:00] are issuing money they're printing money
[27:02] basically and with that they're paying
[27:04] for it and the US uh USA is in a good
[27:07] position because they can export that
[27:09] dep to other countries I think there's
[27:12] something like 64 countries or something
[27:15] around that uh thing that they only use
[27:18] the US dollar so if they print they can
[27:21] export the inflation and benefit in the
[27:24] USA which is an crazy concept if you see
[27:29] it and if you then imagine everything is
[27:33] on the same layer like all the countries
[27:36] are on bitcoin and there are no National
[27:38] fear currencies which is completely
[27:41] crazy and unbelievable to even think of
[27:43] that and it will take a long time I
[27:46] don't know if I ever see this in my
[27:47] lifetime it will take a long time to for
[27:50] that to happen and a lot of PE Bitcoins
[27:52] are like oh it will happen in the next
[27:53] five years 10 years I think this will
[27:56] take way longer than that uh but if you
[27:59] think of that then is if you do
[28:01] something in India that benefits
[28:04] Humanity that also benefits everyone
[28:06] around the world yeah uh so it's this
[28:09] this this kind of borders are kind of
[28:12] getting loose because all of the sudden
[28:14] the money is uh the same and then how is
[28:18] the world then ordering itself and how
[28:21] is uh War financed and stuff like that
[28:23] that's that's really interesting I also
[28:25] did not go extremely deep on that
[28:28] because there a lot of question marks in
[28:29] that if that happens how this happens
[28:31] when this happens what are the
[28:33] implications of that but it's definitely
[28:35] really really interesting
[28:38] uh if you if you ask a question for
[28:40] yourself why do people do award because
[28:43] humans humans have that in DNA uh that
[28:46] you know I'm better than you and uh I
[28:49] want to control things I don't want to
[28:51] give the control to others you know
[28:53] that's the basic reason I feel uh the
[28:57] war happens and now I feel um oh no yeah
[29:02] so as you said that you know how do you
[29:05] see Bitcoin being the world one currency
[29:09] and how do you think U what do you think
[29:11] about all the nations adopting to it one
[29:15] one imagination I could do was if you
[29:19] see the recent 15 years people have more
[29:22] adoption in business in different
[29:24] countries where their businesses are
[29:25] spread across the countries like that uh
[29:29] the Next Generation what do you call the
[29:31] generation Jen Alpha who were born after
[29:34] 200 yeah Jen Alpha I think is the the
[29:36] next one yeah yeah so so their life
[29:39] would be more about traveling and taking
[29:42] their life energy which is stored in
[29:44] terms of Bitcoin and they can travel all
[29:47] across the world and have uh uh have the
[29:52] visible account of that ledger on
[29:54] bitcoin core and that's where I feel the
[29:58] adoption can run much faster and and the
[30:01] Boomers and the the Generation X
[30:03] Millennials I think eventually they will
[30:06] put their all wealth into you know
[30:08] something called Bitcoin and I don't see
[30:10] any other uh currency
[30:12] or um crypto can even come closer to it
[30:16] because you can just create lot of thers
[30:19] do you see any do you see any threats to
[30:23] bitcoin still like is there anything uh
[30:25] do you see any um case where like when
[30:28] this happens this would be really bad
[30:30] for Bitcoin or this could happen this
[30:33] could be bad for Bitcoin uh do you see
[30:35] any threats or dangerous for for
[30:38] Bitcoin
[30:41] uh I want to think twice before I say
[30:44] this because you know if you see black
[30:47] rock and uh Fidelity right so one of
[30:50] some of the major corporations of the
[30:53] world um they have acquired Bitcoin and
[30:57] they they're giving it to the normal
[30:59] citizens in terms of ETF if you want to
[31:02] buy Bitcoin you have to buy ETF they
[31:04] will hold Black Rock will hold Bitcoin
[31:07] on behalf of you you don't have to go
[31:09] through all you know um phases of
[31:12] holding the keys you know putting it
[31:14] under wallets all these things you don't
[31:16] have to do it you just buy ETF but if
[31:18] you want to get it to your own wallet
[31:21] you cannot do that you have to sell sell
[31:23] it back to them and you can get in terms
[31:25] of cash that means once the Bitcoin goes
[31:28] into their hands you cannot get it
[31:31] back
[31:33] then there is the power which they have
[31:36] and you will not be able to hold your
[31:38] own custody I'm super excited to
[31:41] announce that this podcast got the first
[31:45] ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[31:49] from day one and they teach and preach
[31:52] self custody this is my goto exchange
[31:55] when someone asks me oh where can I buy
[31:58] my Bitcoin from this is the easiest
[32:00] entry for bitcoiners and if you want
[32:03] lower fees Plus at the same time support
[32:06] this podcast use code Robin and click
[32:08] the link in the description if you have
[32:11] Bitcoin then uh have it yourself and not
[32:14] buy an IOU because Bitcoin ETFs having
[32:17] Bitcoin on Exchange is the same thing in
[32:19] my opinion it doesn't matter if it holds
[32:22] black rock or coinbase I mean the end
[32:24] the end a coinbase is holding it
[32:26] anyways
[32:28] uh but hold hold your Bitcoin for
[32:30] yourself this is also interesting self-
[32:32] custody because we still see small
[32:36] numbers of self custody people are doing
[32:38] like when we see oh how many Hardware
[32:40] wallets are being sold how many metal
[32:43] plates are being sold how many this and
[32:44] that is being sold um it's still really
[32:47] early a really small number is actually
[32:49] doing it and even Bitcoin even even
[32:52] Bitcoin only exchanges I talk my sponsor
[32:54] of this podcast is 21 Bitcoin and they
[32:57] Bitcoin only they are actually um
[33:00] pushing self- custody they are saying to
[33:03] everyone that is buying Bitcoin through
[33:05] them put it in self- custody they having
[33:08] videos on the platform they are pushing
[33:10] their people to self- custody and even
[33:14] they only have a self custody rate of
[33:16] 60% 40% of people still hold it on the
[33:19] exchange even though the exchange pushes
[33:21] them to self custody which is really
[33:24] interesting and like binance and all
[33:27] those bigger crypto exchanges they have
[33:30] like self custody rates of 10 five% or
[33:32] something like that so how do you how do
[33:34] you see self- custody like do you um see
[33:37] a world where everybody holds that or is
[33:39] it always like a minority that Outsider
[33:43] that the people that actually want to
[33:45] hold it for themselves is this will be
[33:47] will this always be a minority and most
[33:49] will buy an
[33:50] ETF uh it's about education the current
[33:53] people who are buying ETF uh and
[33:56] allowing their well to be controlled by
[33:59] the banks are the ones who have been
[34:01] educated through the system itself once
[34:04] you understand Bitcoin it's a new system
[34:06] it's a new education where you'll have
[34:08] to unlearn the older education and then
[34:11] get this new education of Bitcoin
[34:13] because it's all about holding your
[34:15] own um fruit of Labor you're not giving
[34:19] it to someone else you know when you uh
[34:22] the generation above us like Millennials
[34:24] and all so they have been um you know
[34:27] giving their entire fruit of Labor to
[34:29] the banks and they do a fractional
[34:31] Reserve System and once you go to and
[34:34] let's say a million people go to the
[34:35] bank and they say they want to withdraw
[34:36] money they don't have the money that you
[34:38] know the story how it is so I feel uh in
[34:42] future I feel that once uh as I told you
[34:45] gen Alpha will lead the society I think
[34:49] post 2050 this is what I could imagine
[34:52] post 2050 the Gen Alpha will lead most
[34:54] of the society and everyone will be you
[34:58] know doing self- custody and somewhere
[35:02] you know they will uh participate in
[35:04] either a group mining or an individual
[35:07] mining with their phones like uh 25
[35:10] years back you had television and you
[35:13] had media groups who can run News
[35:15] Channel you can run soaps you can run so
[35:18] many other things and now you it's it's
[35:20] easy to open your own YouTube account
[35:22] and you can own your own media so I feel
[35:26] it could be in a similar fashion where
[35:28] you own your own bank you have your own
[35:30] bank and you can lend it or maybe you
[35:32] can self custody it you can mine Bitcoin
[35:36] in Satoshi and Satoshi might be in a
[35:39] highest value this is what I could
[35:42] imagine
[35:43] farf yeah it's also like interesting
[35:46] what you mentioned with media
[35:48] decentralizing because like just a few
[35:50] years or just a few decades ago there
[35:53] was only this big media houses and and
[35:56] big like most also government Finance
[36:00] stuff they're still there like they are
[36:03] still living here and they're still big
[36:05] and they are still influencing a lot of
[36:07] people like it's not only social media
[36:09] it's not only YouTube uh they are still
[36:11] really really big but we see now a shift
[36:13] and I watch a lot of metrics for example
[36:16] what's uh production minute is costing
[36:20] on television and YouTube and YouTube is
[36:22] actually now getting to the television
[36:24] level and accelerating above that it
[36:27] means that a lot of money is going to
[36:30] the New Media form YouTube X Twitter uh
[36:34] Tik Tok Instagram all the platforms how
[36:37] do you see that developing is is this
[36:40] the future where we only see like in We
[36:42] are following more individuals and less
[36:46] networks that's again uh it's not far uh
[36:51] from the age what I spoke about uh
[36:54] Bitcoin being you know the 2050 era I
[36:57] think this will happen much earlier
[37:00] because now you know some of the uh I'm
[37:03] not sure of the data but I I saw
[37:05] somewhere on Twitter itself you know
[37:07] Harvard and Stanford uh the applications
[37:10] are received Less in 2022 and 2023
[37:13] that's what I I saw I'm not sure of that
[37:16] I need to reconfirm that with that
[37:18] information I feel that people uh at a
[37:21] very young age are understanding that
[37:23] you don't need a college degree to
[37:24] survive you just need to know how to
[37:27] build a content which is very easy you
[37:29] just need a cell phone you can even buy
[37:30] your Mother's or Father's cell phone
[37:32] start creating content whatever you like
[37:34] whatever your interest are so you create
[37:36] it and once you create a value and that
[37:39] value has to come back to you and that
[37:41] if it is with Bitcoin I feel that will
[37:43] be very exponential and this is where I
[37:45] feel the future the direction of our
[37:47] future is
[37:49] also there's another interesting thing I
[37:51] just saw it on on Twitter just came up
[37:53] to my mind it there like how U private
[37:57] schools public schools and homeschooling
[38:01] develops and public schools are actually
[38:04] decreasing like people uh get their kids
[38:07] uh more and more out of public schools
[38:10] and uh homeschooling is increasing a lot
[38:13] like it's I think it was like 70%
[38:16] growing from year to year from this year
[38:19] to last year and I think since 2020
[38:22] started this whole thing because parents
[38:24] were forced to homeschool and then some
[38:27] of them like oh it actually works fine
[38:29] and people the the kids are with me and
[38:31] I can enjoy that uh it's it's it's
[38:34] different for everyone because some
[38:35] parents are like oh I want I want my
[38:37] kids to be in the school yeah uh so
[38:40] private school is increasing public
[38:42] school is decreasing and uh
[38:44] homeschooling is just exploding over I
[38:47] don't have kids like I I'm just 25 so I
[38:50] don't have a strong opinion on that but
[38:52] I talk with a lot of bitcoiners and
[38:55] especially those who have kids they're
[38:57] like I want to homeschool or they are
[39:00] even now homeschooling some don't have
[39:02] the possibility to homeschooling you
[39:03] also have to have the luxury to
[39:05] homeschool your kids yeah I also see a
[39:08] future U where you know uh someone who
[39:12] has started creating content at the at
[39:14] the age of 13 or 15 and by the time when
[39:16] Bitcoin becomes a unit of account right
[39:18] at that stage in medium of exchange and
[39:20] then when it crosses that I feel that
[39:22] you know uh uh a person or a human being
[39:26] can provide value to the society until
[39:28] 25 or 26 and you if you can see the LA
[39:31] every four years after the halfing and
[39:33] you know Bitcoin is like shooting up
[39:35] around 10x and 15x right and the mass
[39:38] adoption happens I feel a human being
[39:40] can work with creativity for almost 8 to
[39:43] 10 years accumulate Satoshi and he can
[39:46] basically live his life for free because
[39:49] every Satoshi is you know increasing its
[39:51] value and the other Commodities and
[39:54] things around you like banana or car or
[39:57] house house the value is decreasing so
[40:00] it's it becomes super affordable and
[40:01] super cheap and your life can be like
[40:04] you know by the time you're 25 or 27 you
[40:07] can basically live off on Satoshi and
[40:09] you can do whatever you want travel the
[40:11] world experience the nature you know
[40:13] swim in the river you can do whatever
[40:15] you want with your family this is where
[40:17] I feel uh a big difference might happen
[40:20] once Bitcoin becomes unit of account and
[40:24] and forever it's it's also an
[40:26] interesting future uh because when you
[40:29] think about it we are always getting
[40:31] better in producing stuff like uh when
[40:34] you think about our phone our technology
[40:37] uh 10 years ago to do exactly what we
[40:40] are doing right now very complicated and
[40:43] very expensive right now I'm paying a
[40:46] small subscription to Riverside and it's
[40:49] it's basically free like it's it's is if
[40:51] you calculate the whole cost like what
[40:53] would it cost for you to come to Austria
[40:56] sit down with me studio and record this
[40:58] whole thing like this would be a whole
[41:00] fear it would be a lot of cost involved
[41:03] but now with Riverside it's it's
[41:05] basically free it's like I don't know
[41:07] pay like €2 200 EUR a year or something
[41:09] like that um so when we extrapolate that
[41:14] out in the future with everything we're
[41:16] getting better in producing bananas uh
[41:18] to stay with that example we're getting
[41:21] better and efficient to producing houses
[41:23] we getting better and efficient to
[41:24] producing everything we are consuming
[41:27] and with robotics and maybe even AI that
[41:30] takes uh jobs up that we don't need to
[41:33] do um then we're coming to a point where
[41:37] the people actually have to work less
[41:40] and less to have the same standard of
[41:42] living so we are coming into an
[41:44] deflationary abundant future yeah and
[41:48] that's a crazy world to see do you have
[41:51] any uh do you have any future vision for
[41:54] that that kind of a f like Bitcoin
[41:56] abundant future uh like next 100 years
[41:58] it's it's difficult to see it but it's
[42:00] I'm just wondering if you have any
[42:02] thoughts about that uh I don't want to
[42:05] see uh more than 100 years or so but I
[42:08] would definitely like to see my children
[42:10] when they are uh probably around 15 to
[42:14] 20 I think if uh Bitcoin becomes unit of
[42:17] account before that or maybe around
[42:19] somewhere around that I think they will
[42:21] be very lucky they will work very Less
[42:23] in their life they will enjoy their life
[42:26] when they have that you know muscular
[42:28] energy with them until 35 and 45 and
[42:31] they will work towards you know happy
[42:33] moments of their life because you know
[42:36] let me put it across this way how many
[42:37] life you have
[42:39] got yeah just one just one just one no
[42:44] Robin here in the in the past or no
[42:46] Robin here in the future right this is
[42:47] what we need to understand it's one life
[42:50] and and and my dad's life one life was
[42:53] always around working hard to make ends
[42:56] meet that's not something we need to do
[42:59] now we need to be very aware and we have
[43:01] to I feel we have to fight for that
[43:03] right um make
[43:05] Bitcoin adoption for the masses so that
[43:08] our children live a fantastic life and
[43:11] we we we should be able to see that with
[43:13] our bad
[43:15] eyes yeah it's it's so true and it's um
[43:18] I think an a beautiful uh thought to
[43:21] think about that kind of a future um
[43:24] yeah we have an a special episode kind
[43:27] of because you prepared question also
[43:29] for me yeah uh if you want we can uh get
[43:33] to to some of your interesting most like
[43:35] one two interesting question if you you
[43:37] want to do that um usually I don't do
[43:40] the podcast over an hour so we like one
[43:42] two question we can definitely get to
[43:44] and then we when we have the end routine
[43:46] also in the in the podcast where like a
[43:49] previous guest asked you a question uh
[43:52] this is so then the the end of the
[43:54] podcast so if you if you have one or two
[43:56] questions that is really interesting you
[43:58] want to ask me uh then I think now would
[44:00] be the perfect timing oh yeah so as an
[44:03] experienced podcaster so now I think you
[44:05] have reached uh 25 this is the 25th
[44:08] episode for you or actually it's my 63rd
[44:12] uh episode because I have so many
[44:14] episodes uh in the backlog like I have I
[44:17] think one whole month of of episodes
[44:20] that I did not release so it's like more
[44:22] than you see from the YouTube okay as an
[44:25] experienced podcaster in the Bitcoin
[44:27] space alone how do you navigate the
[44:29] balance between uh you know providing
[44:32] accessible content for the newcomers and
[44:35] offering in-depth analysis for seasoned
[44:37] Enthusiast in the podcast episodes oh
[44:40] that's so hard and I think about that a
[44:41] lot so like um because I have a lot of
[44:46] bitcoiners on I have I had Jeff Bo on I
[44:49] have Natalie prell on I have a physicist
[44:52] on that talks about the Bitcoin power LW
[44:55] I have so many different kind of
[44:57] um people on that are in different
[44:59] stages of their Bitcoin journey and the
[45:02] interesting thing is I try to keep it
[45:06] simple and I'm not afraid to ask the
[45:09] stupid question I'm not like I'm I'm
[45:12] always asking like oh actually I don't
[45:14] understand this what what is that
[45:15] meaning even sometimes even if I
[45:18] understand it because I always um have
[45:21] this in my mind and I think I never
[45:23] talked about that actually I have uh a
[45:26] cousin of in my mind I have my
[45:28] girlfriend in mind I have my mother in
[45:29] mind I have my father in mind when I
[45:32] hear something on the podcast I'm like
[45:34] do they understand this because they're
[45:36] not as deep as me in Bitcoin do they
[45:39] understand this because we have to
[45:41] recognize in every Bitcoin conversation
[45:44] there is someone in there that is
[45:46] completely new to the uh topic that just
[45:49] started learning about Bitcoin today
[45:52] there there's someone that just got the
[45:55] video uh uh made maybe this is like a
[45:58] someone that wants to be a Batman player
[46:00] I put like something with Batman player
[46:02] in the thumbnail and they're like oh
[46:03] Bitcoin and Batman that sounds
[46:05] interesting he clicked on it and he's
[46:06] listening now so I always try to keep it
[46:11] um watchable for someone that is um new
[46:17] and I always even if I go to the deeper
[46:21] uh uh questions and deeper things I try
[46:25] to keep it low level like like so that
[46:27] everybody can understand uh but it's
[46:30] it's hard because it's not always easy
[46:33] because we are talking about Bitcoin and
[46:35] we are just further down the rabbit hole
[46:37] and when both are further down the
[46:39] rabbit hole and he's starting here then
[46:42] it's like he has he he's thinking like
[46:45] what are the those two weird guys
[46:47] talking about yes that's a great
[46:50] connection because even I connected like
[46:52] that because most of the podcasts
[46:54] Bitcoin podcasts are about the people
[46:56] who are at least eight years you know
[46:58] experience in this but you have a
[47:00] variety of uh bitcoiners who we have
[47:03] never heard of and that immediately
[47:05] Clicks in our minds that okay somebody
[47:07] like us let's let's hear hear them out
[47:09] that's a fantastic I I um invited I
[47:13] think almost I think 10 people are now
[47:17] from the 60 people that were on the
[47:19] first podcast with my podcast and I put
[47:22] yesterday a tweet out
[47:25] uh the talk I was putting yesterday a
[47:28] tweet on and saying I want this year 300
[47:32] bitcoiners on my
[47:33] podcast so and I put a a picture of
[47:38] halny and so if you know who this guy is
[47:41] DM me I want your to be on my podcast so
[47:44] of course there are people that are on
[47:46] the first podcast ever with with their
[47:48] their in their journey and for some it's
[47:52] difficult I had bitcoiners on that were
[47:54] really nervous with the podcast I really
[47:56] had to guide them through the podcast
[47:58] and we had even I had uh once uh second
[48:01] take we did 40 minutes and he was so um
[48:04] not happy with it so we put like a
[48:06] second take on that and that's totally
[48:09] fine like it's it's it was his first
[48:11] podcast he never talked in front of the
[48:14] camera before so that's a big huge thing
[48:17] H but I want those stories too and this
[48:19] story was actually one of my 10 best
[48:22] videos ever and people like Oh I like
[48:24] that story so much because it's not that
[48:26] Jeff poof story that you already heard
[48:29] 20 times already yeah yeah so it's
[48:32] really interesting and important to have
[48:34] those new in this normal Labs people
[48:37] that are not on every podcast on so
[48:40] that's why I'm doing five podcasts a
[48:42] week I'm forced to bring everyone
[48:46] on that's a that's a great contribution
[48:48] I think um that's a story I think next
[48:52] 15 years somebody will remember and I
[48:55] think many of them will remember so out
[48:57] of three questions my second question
[48:58] would be what is the best moment or
[49:02] maybe you can explain three best moments
[49:05] where you felt like oh mindblowing in
[49:09] your podcast I mean um I mean I talked
[49:13] about him uh today already lot this was
[49:16] a big moment for me because I look out
[49:19] look up to Jeff boo a lot so having him
[49:23] uh the the one of my three favorite
[49:26] Bitcoin guys it's like Michael sailor
[49:28] Jeff po maybe check MERS and like there
[49:31] are like not a lot of bitcoiners that
[49:33] I'm like looking up to like that North
[49:35] Star like they're like wow they they
[49:38] they can they understand Bitcoin on a
[49:40] high level and they can actually explain
[49:41] it all really really good and Jeff PO is
[49:43] for me in this bucket and when he uh
[49:47] started following me on on X and then I
[49:51] messaged him hey do you want to be on my
[49:52] podcast and he said yes sure let's do it
[49:55] uh I was like what what just happened
[49:58] and then I had him on uh this was a huge
[50:00] moment for me honestly I did not hear
[50:03] anything that I did not know on the
[50:04] podcast to be honest I listen to him so
[50:07] much that I whatever he said on the
[50:10] podcast I already knew uh I still tried
[50:13] to keep the podcast uh interesting and
[50:16] new uh but it was just a really huge
[50:19] moment for me then there was another
[50:21] moment where I had someone on that was
[50:23] on my podcast the first time like first
[50:26] podcast for him and he talked about the
[50:28] concept that Bitcoin is a system that is
[50:31] based on
[50:32] love and I was like what are you talking
[50:36] about what why is it based on love it's
[50:38] the mathematic systems and he talked
[50:40] about what is important in love and when
[50:44] do you have an really good love
[50:48] relationship with someone else and he
[50:50] talked about the values you have you
[50:52] have to trust the other person you have
[50:55] to be so sure that the other person does
[50:57] not do anything bad to you that you can
[51:00] have a trustless relationship and he
[51:01] talked about the the connections between
[51:04] that that was completely new for me I
[51:05] never thought about Bitcoin in that way
[51:08] before uh and it was interesting
[51:11] interesting to see and interesting to
[51:13] hear that Bitcoin is a system based on
[51:15] love uh that was really really cool um
[51:20] yeah this was my my two uh um moments
[51:24] that just came up to in my mind if I
[51:26] think about more I think there will be
[51:28] 20 more moments that will come up um but
[51:31] in general I really like doing the
[51:33] interviews with every guest there
[51:35] something new coming like I I have now
[51:38] 63 interviews in uh not even three
[51:42] months I did it like no three months
[51:44] it's now December January and February I
[51:46] did in three months 63 interviews it's a
[51:49] lot of interviews uh on a on a daily
[51:52] basis and every guest is bringing
[51:55] something new in and I see how my
[51:58] communication skills are getting better
[51:59] how my confidence is getting better
[52:01] because I'm kind of adopt to different
[52:03] persons so in general I really like U
[52:06] podcasting like just doing those those
[52:09] things uh and yeah it's but there are a
[52:12] lot of moments that I could like I could
[52:14] do moments from every podcast basically
[52:17] if this answers your questions yeah
[52:19] perfectly the love the love thing was uh
[52:22] fascinating I did not see it that that
[52:25] lens the way he said it it's beautiful
[52:27] yeah I think it's
[52:29] my sorry sorry again again I think it's
[52:32] my third podcast episode if someone
[52:34] wants to check it out uh it's big on the
[52:37] thumbnail Bitcoin is a system based on
[52:39] love I think my third or second or
[52:40] fourth episode or something like that uh
[52:42] for people that want to check it out
[52:44] it's it's really really I can highly
[52:46] recommend it it was completely different
[52:48] to what I ever heard about there nice so
[52:51] my last question would be uh in the
[52:54] future what moment could really satisfy
[52:58] you they say it like you know what's
[53:00] your Tombstone moment what do you want
[53:02] people to uh you know feel about you
[53:06] when you're not there right so so my
[53:09] question again uh is like what satisfies
[53:12] you on that particular moment when you
[53:15] reach maybe 100 or
[53:17] 300 uh uh interviews in your podcast wow
[53:21] uh that's a big question what I ever
[53:24] what I have and it's sometimes uh hard
[53:27] for me to have this um I have this hero
[53:32] complex I name it like that I have this
[53:35] thing that when there is a problem uh in
[53:38] the family or in in in my friend Circle
[53:42] I really want to fix it for them like I
[53:44] have this uh Drive in me that I want to
[53:49] uh be the hero for other people I don't
[53:51] know why it came really early for me and
[53:54] that's why I'm really driven also like I
[53:55] have a like right now I'm only doing
[53:58] this like but I had for like over one
[54:01] year a full-time job and I did the
[54:03] podcast and I did my tweets I grow from
[54:05] 600 followers to 10K followers last year
[54:08] just from my Twitter now I started
[54:11] YouTube I started growing from 200 to
[54:15] now 1,000 followers in in two months so
[54:18] it I'm doing so much work and I want to
[54:22] uh be bigger uh because I just want to
[54:25] and this Sun's really weird and and and
[54:28] and and I never spoke out loud about
[54:30] that in on a podcast uh but I want to
[54:32] really provide for family and friends
[54:35] and be there if someone needs me this is
[54:37] weird because in my family everyone is
[54:40] kind of well off like I'm in a good
[54:42] middle class family like there's we we
[54:45] are I'm not in a poor family where they
[54:47] need my help but I still have this where
[54:49] I'm like I want to be in a position
[54:51] where I can help
[54:53] someone and uh I think my my podcast
[54:56] will help me in that Pursuit but I don't
[54:59] know
[55:00] how and I will I will try to get there
[55:03] but I think if if on the tombstone is
[55:05] like he was there for other people uh
[55:07] this was this would be something I would
[55:09] be proud
[55:10] of wow so you have that leadership
[55:13] quality in you
[55:15] fantastic I'm I'm actually interested
[55:18] what uh this question I want to give
[55:20] back to you
[55:22] also if you allow me I really I really
[55:26] want to to hear what you are saying to
[55:28] this so today um I had taken my wife to
[55:32] her colleagues son's birthday one year
[55:35] birthday so I was just unable to sit
[55:39] there because you know people were just
[55:41] like uh I mean it's not so right to say
[55:45] but they were feeling I was feeling like
[55:46] they were so stupid talking about so
[55:48] many things which I did not like which
[55:50] my it was there was no interest for me
[55:53] and my wife asked me while while I come
[55:55] back so why were you so off why were you
[55:58] not involved with all of us I said uh
[56:01] there is something in me which is you
[56:03] know Rising rapidly and what was that
[56:06] and I told her that you know I want to
[56:08] provide many things for my family there
[56:10] is so much uh you know pain in in some
[56:14] of my friends and my uh you know cousins
[56:17] that you know they always crib about
[56:19] their life there's so much of debt
[56:21] around there's so much of uh
[56:23] unhealthiness unhappiness in in relation
[56:26] relationships and love how can we fix it
[56:28] you know uh what can we do for them and
[56:30] I feel very responsible being an elderly
[56:32] person elderly cousin out of my 10
[56:35] cousins so I really want to be that guy
[56:37] as you said right so if if someone feels
[56:40] that you know I can fix it and I need to
[56:42] be there at that moment and that really
[56:45] satisfies me you know that is what
[56:48] something you know I would like to look
[56:50] forward in future amazing yeah it's it's
[56:53] that's where we connected both I think
[56:56] yeah I think it's it's it's it's great
[56:58] and it it drives a lot because if if you
[57:01] only driven for yourself you will be at
[57:04] some point be exhausted but if you're
[57:06] driven for other people uh your drive
[57:08] will go on forever I think this it's a
[57:11] good motiv this is do you think this
[57:13] this uh thought process could have come
[57:17] from understanding Bitcoin deeply
[57:19] because when the money is fixed I think
[57:22] almost every other puzzle is fixed it's
[57:25] a fundamental to it like Bitcoin is so
[57:28] fun because there are a lot of people in
[57:30] Bitcoin that say like oh Bitcoin is just
[57:32] money like don't put it in all those
[57:34] categories and it fixes everything and
[57:36] stuff like that but Bitcoin touches
[57:39] everything in our life because it's
[57:41] money whenever people are doing
[57:44] something with each other they're
[57:46] transacting uh energy and we are having
[57:49] money to get uh like an a point system
[57:54] to it and the point system is now but
[57:57] Bitcoin would be a more fair point
[57:59] system because then there's not a
[58:01] central bank stealing uh the life energy
[58:03] from you so if then we don't have
[58:07] someone else stealing from us and saying
[58:10] the stealing is good for us uh then we
[58:13] search everywhere else with with the
[58:16] finger like okay if the stealing the
[58:18] inflation is good but I'm not happy like
[58:21] where can I find the wrong person like
[58:23] and I think if we fix it fun fundamental
[58:26] layer of money uh there's a lot more
[58:30] trust in our society back because all of
[58:32] the sudden uh we don't have to trust on
[58:35] the money part in the relationship
[58:38] between people money is like it's clear
[58:41] and maybe I'm just a dreamful person but
[58:44] I think this will fix a lot of problems
[58:47] with Bitcoin because fun money is so
[58:50] fundamental to us yeah um we coming now
[58:53] uh over one hour to the to the end
[58:54] routine unfortunately to our
[58:57] podcast yeah it
[58:59] was I just couldn't feel uh the time
[59:02] passing by yeah it's like over one hour
[59:05] it was like like w our last question is
[59:09] always a question from our previous
[59:11] guest that has a question for the next
[59:14] guest without knowing who is the next
[59:16] guest actually and he has a Bitcoin
[59:18] question and he asked will colonies on
[59:21] Mars use Bitcoin no interesting because
[59:25] the person who who takes us to the mass
[59:27] will have a company and if he doesn't or
[59:30] she doesn't or the company doesn't allow
[59:32] them to use Bitcoin fully I think they
[59:35] might not use it interesting yeah it
[59:38] will be uh definitely interesting how we
[59:41] colonize mas and I think ill musk will
[59:43] be more probably
[59:45] the he will use
[59:49] Dogecoin I don't know this is how I
[59:51] think but yeah the governance part right
[59:53] so the I I still feel there is a lot of
[59:57] Innovations to be happening in the next
[60:00] layer of Bitcoin we are still pre Amazon
[60:03] we are still pre Facebook we still pre
[60:06] Twitter yes uh those moments yet to come
[60:10] because the real sharp gen Alpha people
[60:13] are still yet to come in the industry
[60:15] and once they come they they will have
[60:18] that Einstein moment and they can create
[60:20] some
[60:21] Innovation yeah totally totally agree we
[60:23] are really early on and uh we live
[60:26] before the
[60:27] 2000 um Bubble we still before that the
[60:32] iPhone is still 10 15 years away and the
[60:34] moment is still coming up thank you moit
