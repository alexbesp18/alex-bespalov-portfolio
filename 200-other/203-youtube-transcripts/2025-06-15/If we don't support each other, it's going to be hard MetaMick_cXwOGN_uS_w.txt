[00:00] toling is great we all love it but if we
[00:02] don't support Bitcoin initiatives around
[00:04] the world it's going to be hard we have
[00:05] to support each other we have to support
[00:08] creators that are adding value to
[00:09] bitcoin Bitcoin is fundamentally
[00:12] revolutionary technology that actually
[00:14] isn't revolutionary at all because it
[00:15] brings us back to to Nature brings us
[00:17] back to hard money which is something
[00:19] that's existed for for a long time
[00:20] fundraising just doesn't work you know
[00:22] in 85% of the world nobody can use it
[00:24] and then secondly there's a problem of
[00:26] censorship I saw on the website that you
[00:28] has like uh guys has over 30 Bitcoins
[00:31] already um raised and over thousand over
[00:36] thousand projects and the most
[00:38] interesting part for me is that uh
[00:40] 55,000 different contributors are
[00:43] included in that um before we get into
[00:46] interesting projects and all the
[00:48] interesting stuff with Gea uh for people
[00:50] that don't know it what is it and why
[00:53] did you started that project absolutely
[00:56] so yeah so but what is geyser geyser is
[00:59] um uh
[01:00] what we call a Creator platform it's a
[01:02] platform for creators to launch their
[01:04] ideas get support from the community
[01:07] whether it's through donations whether
[01:08] it's through selling rewards perks um
[01:12] and then more basically tools for
[01:15] fundraising and uh it's all started with
[01:18] the idea of donations right and donation
[01:21] something that even just by itself works
[01:23] very very poorly in the Fiat system to
[01:25] give you an example if you want to use
[01:28] GoFundMe or Kickstarter or Indiegogo
[01:31] these platforms work in only 30
[01:33] countries if you want to create a
[01:35] project so if you're in Brazil if you're
[01:38] in in South in Brazil in in Brazil in
[01:41] Africa and in other countries in Asia
[01:43] you cannot use these tools and you can't
[01:46] use them because they rely on PayPal and
[01:48] stripe and other sort of cumbersome um
[01:52] and unfair um regulations that make it
[01:56] hard for people around the world to to
[01:57] to to make money online
[02:00] so geyser and Bitcoin Bitcoin solves
[02:03] this geyser really just uses Bitcoin and
[02:05] lightning and we try to make it as easy
[02:07] as possible for people to launch their
[02:08] ideas and receive donations so that's
[02:11] how you have uh over over around around
[02:14] 50% of all projects on Geyser are based
[02:17] in these emerging markets in other
[02:20] countries that don't have access to to
[02:23] this tool now ever since that we then
[02:26] launch other features like rewards you
[02:27] can sell you know tickets books
[02:30] you can sell gifts Raffles like all
[02:32] sorts of different things so that you
[02:35] can give something back to those people
[02:37] who are donating um and then we also
[02:39] have yeah more more features like that
[02:41] coming up as well that are really about
[02:42] helping creators uh online to to
[02:46] monetize and um empowering them how do
[02:50] how does this work with monetizing
[02:51] creators like just uh that the guys is
[02:54] the middleman between uh the creators
[02:57] and the audience or is
[03:00] Pat subscriptions going on yeah so the
[03:03] so it's it's mainly right now really
[03:05] creating a platform where their project
[03:08] can live so we do have a lot of
[03:09] podcasters for example that have their
[03:11] project on Geyser and they can sometimes
[03:14] you know can sell like sponsorship on
[03:17] Geyser it's really um we are the the the
[03:21] interface that can that doesn't touch
[03:24] the money so we don't custody any funds
[03:26] the funds go straight through us and
[03:28] into the hands of the the creators
[03:30] themselves so it's we're creating this
[03:31] new model for for creators uh where we
[03:35] just provide the easy user experience
[03:38] the interface but um just to help the
[03:42] Creator showcase their idea kind of
[03:45] promote themselves um and then sell
[03:48] their stuff it's interesting because uh
[03:51] I think one major Catalyst where also
[03:54] GoFundMe was really in the news was the
[03:56] Canadian tracker um yeah incident
[04:01] yeah I was going to mention that good
[04:02] good point so that's the other thing the
[04:03] first point is fundraising just doesn't
[04:06] work in this you know 85% of the world
[04:09] nobody can use it and then secondly
[04:11] there's a problem with censorship every
[04:13] uh crowdfunding app platform it acts a
[04:17] bit like a bank they use these third
[04:18] party uh accounts that can allow people
[04:22] to hold their funds in in in their in
[04:25] their apps in the in these in these
[04:28] companies and um and we completely
[04:30] deviate from that because the funds go
[04:32] straight through us we don't custody we
[04:34] don't control the funds at any point so
[04:37] there is no way that we could ever
[04:39] freeze funds there's no way that we
[04:41] could ever freeze funds so absolutely
[04:43] Bitcoin fixes this as well the funds go
[04:46] straight to the creators and um and we
[04:49] cannot we cannot we cannot get in the
[04:51] way and also importantly go fun me
[04:54] Kickstarter patreon sometimes takes up
[04:56] up to takes months if not years
[04:58] sometimes to receive the money
[05:00] the money gets stuck and it takes a long
[05:03] time for the the creators to actually
[05:05] get paid I think Gum Road is another one
[05:07] takes two to three weeks guys or instant
[05:10] you get the money right away so
[05:13] really it's funny how an decentralized
[05:16] Network can be more effective and faster
[05:21] than the centralized database entry that
[05:23] has basically like what do they have to
[05:25] do like it's just centralized database
[05:28] entry how can this uh take so long and
[05:31] decentralized there's proof of work
[05:33] there's all those different attributes
[05:35] that work together uh theoretically uh
[05:38] everybody would say like yeah of course
[05:39] centralized exchanges are more way more
[05:41] effective but when you look at the
[05:43] reality Bitcoin is actually more
[05:46] effective in in handling those situation
[05:48] it's it's fascinating to
[05:50] see yeah very good point I mean Bitcoin
[05:54] uh can be quite slow right but that's
[05:57] why we we use we're we're lightning
[05:59] native so
[06:01] every probably all transactions let's
[06:03] say 95% of all transactions happen
[06:06] eventually through through lightning and
[06:08] even if you found on shame we swap it
[06:10] over to lightning and
[06:13] so yeah speed of light it's amazing uh
[06:17] this Canadian trucker uh did this happen
[06:21] before you get started or is this
[06:22] something where you already started or
[06:24] was this the triger point where you get
[06:26] started good question we actually were
[06:30] triggered before the trucker Convoy to
[06:32] start on the summer of
[06:33] 2021 me and stos my co-founder we then
[06:38] launched a pilot
[06:39] project with the pl the platform with
[06:43] one project and then you could request
[06:45] to get access to the entire platform to
[06:48] to to you can request to launch your own
[06:51] project H and that we launched the week
[06:54] after the trucker thing happened so we
[06:58] had a lot of people saying hey launch
[07:00] trucker project on your platform and we
[07:03] were like we just launched and I felt a
[07:05] bit like we might kick The Hornet's Nest
[07:07] kind of episode here so we we decided to
[07:10] to not get involved because it had been
[07:13] way too early we had just launched this
[07:15] thing and well we couldn't we were
[07:17] technically not ready for it but also
[07:20] but that helped us to understand how
[07:21] important this is as a tool and how we
[07:25] can you know bring this tool to all
[07:28] sorts of use cases so people all around
[07:29] the world that don't have the stool but
[07:31] also for for all these other use cases
[07:34] where people want to just you know have
[07:36] certain beliefs have certain um values
[07:41] have certain objectives and they can't
[07:43] raise funds for them I do have plenty
[07:45] many friends who have sent $10 to the
[07:48] truckers via GoFundMe their bank
[07:50] accounts are Frozen um and it's it's
[07:54] unbelievable how and then I tell them
[07:57] about guys and they say oh my God that's
[08:00] going to change everything um and just
[08:03] the idea like the fear they were feeling
[08:05] the fear of of losing their funds or the
[08:08] their entire bank accounts being
[08:11] blocked and and the fact that even their
[08:14] names were leaked that you know this the
[08:16] the Canadian governments
[08:18] leaked the
[08:20] names and last names of all the people
[08:23] who funded towards those campaigns they
[08:27] dox
[08:28] them by like intentionally and how did
[08:31] they do that I did not know about that I
[08:33] don't know the intent I suspect that
[08:35] they would uh they they they released it
[08:38] um basically as just to say these people
[08:40] are are bad people uh how bizarre is
[08:45] that like even for me the whole Canadian
[08:48] tracker is like even if you completely
[08:50] stand on the other side of what they
[08:52] protested you you should even then you
[08:56] should uh completely um support them to
[09:00] at least have the right to uh support
[09:03] whoever they want like uh there's only
[09:06] it's only a matter of time till your
[09:08] opinion stands on the other side of the
[09:10] government it's like wait long enough
[09:13] and all of the sudden you are the the
[09:15] victim of of stuff like that and then
[09:17] you are really really um glad that
[09:20] something like geyser something like
[09:21] Bitcoin like Bitcoin is a Bas lay guys
[09:24] an application on top of that um is
[09:26] there and can support you yeah
[09:29] absolutely and just to to pigy back on
[09:32] that idea uh so guys are see if the
[09:34] government came over and said they give
[09:37] take take the project down or or or
[09:40] freeze the funds we couldn't freeze the
[09:43] funds because we don't we don't custody
[09:44] them in terms of taking the project down
[09:46] that that may be a place where as a
[09:49] platform we have to comply with
[09:50] regulations and so if a particular
[09:53] jurisdiction were to say that we might
[09:55] have to comply that said every project
[09:57] on Geyser is also
[10:00] Noster and so what that means is the
[10:03] project itself can never really fully
[10:05] can never be
[10:07] deplatformed the pl the project may be
[10:10] the sorry the project may be the
[10:12] platform just not the protocol if you
[10:14] know what I mean the project itself
[10:16] exists on Noster across relays it
[10:18] doesn't exist just on Geyser so you
[10:20] could continue to to support a project
[10:23] in the future uh even if it's not um
[10:27] even if it's not through gyser how is is
[10:29] uh the interface between Gea and Nostra
[10:33] like how does they interact with each
[10:35] other yeah so at the geyser all the
[10:38] geyser projects are sitting on the
[10:41] geyser relay the Noster
[10:43] relay and so the geyser interface
[10:46] showcases all the data that just from
[10:51] the geyser relay right so the difference
[10:53] between a no typical Noster client is
[10:55] that a Noster client will be fetching uh
[10:58] data from
[10:59] I don't know 20 relays well the geyser
[11:03] interface is looking just at the geyser
[11:06] relay and uh the re you know this may
[11:10] not be the case in the future we may
[11:12] decide to expand but the reason for that
[11:14] is because every gazer because all
[11:16] relays are talk are about profiles
[11:18] instead gazer is concerned about
[11:20] projects gazer is concerned about
[11:22] campaigns but so down the line if
[11:24] there's another crowdfunding platform
[11:25] that rises that also deals with projects
[11:28] well then
[11:29] we can start
[11:31] pulling data from them as well uh and in
[11:34] any case you can go on any noer client
[11:36] and already see the guer projects uh use
[11:39] by fetching Gea relay data so yeah
[11:44] that's that's really interesting because
[11:45] even if like there's a project that's
[11:48] controversial that some jurisdiction
[11:50] says we don't want that on geysa they
[11:52] force you to take it down you obviously
[11:54] have to comply otherwise the whole
[11:56] project whole guys probably will will
[11:59] will will go down so you will take it
[12:01] down and the interesting thing now no
[12:04] funds are lost to this point because the
[12:07] funds are not with you they are already
[12:10] with the ones who received it uh and uh
[12:13] they even have the possibility through
[12:16] the nosto protocol to let it live on and
[12:19] even if it gets down on on Gea maybe
[12:21] there's another uh similar side that
[12:24] picks it up or there's some other thing
[12:26] that picks it up and the most important
[12:28] thing I think is it it can the the funds
[12:31] cannot get Frozen and and you also don't
[12:34] know who funded it like it's just a
[12:36] lightning address so you you don't know
[12:38] um the the persons it's like not you
[12:40] don't have the possibility to get our
[12:42] clear names you maybe can get a Bitcoin
[12:45] or lightning addresses out of from it
[12:47] right yeah so so the funders I mean the
[12:51] funders right the funders can't find
[12:53] anonymously or they can fund um or they
[12:56] can fund using by logging in you're
[12:59] right if they fund via lightning
[13:01] address that's a good question I don't
[13:03] think we could ever know the lightning
[13:06] address of the sender no I don't think
[13:08] it's
[13:09] possible yeah so you can fund on
[13:11] Lightning anonymously on chain you can
[13:14] also fun anonymously
[13:17] Sous um so yeah that's absolutely
[13:20] supported that's really cool that uh we
[13:23] are building now all those decentralized
[13:26] tools that basically um like in the in
[13:31] the most uh critical like in the most um
[13:34] offensive way it's undermines the go
[13:37] government control it undermines the
[13:39] power power of the government and this
[13:42] is uh something that uh I think will
[13:45] will be an interesting uh journey to be
[13:48] on in the next like couple five 10 20
[13:50] years and I talk with a lot of different
[13:53] bitcoiners on the on the podcast how
[13:56] Bitcoin and applications on top of
[13:58] Bitcoin will change uh our um Society
[14:03] how we can live together because in the
[14:05] end of the day Bitcoin is just money but
[14:07] the interesting part with money is that
[14:09] you can build on top of it when it's
[14:11] programmable with Bitcoin and it's that
[14:14] interface and you can put applications
[14:16] on top of it and all of the sudden all
[14:18] those centralized things we go fundme
[14:21] and the feat system and Banks uh they
[14:24] can just be like oh government knocks on
[14:26] the door this account please free freeze
[14:29] we don't we want those those lists and
[14:31] now there are services and applications
[14:33] where you don't even have the
[14:34] possibility to do that and only if you
[14:37] don't have the possibility to do that
[14:38] don't do that then only you can actually
[14:41] provide that decentralized um way of of
[14:45] of of thinking it's really really
[14:48] cool um for uh for to get an an feeling
[14:53] what's the kind of projects on on G and
[14:56] what's going on um can you maybe share
[14:58] like what are the most successful
[15:01] projects uh the projects that tend to do
[15:04] really good on on Gea or the projects
[15:07] that are like this is where people want
[15:10] to uh fund the
[15:13] projects yeah good question so we have
[15:18] most projects on Geyser are still very
[15:20] much Bitcoin related uh I think 90 95%
[15:24] of projects are have to do with Bitcoin
[15:26] in some form or fashion um in terms of
[15:29] the successful
[15:30] projects we have three broad categories
[15:33] of projects there's education right
[15:36] projects that are trying to support
[15:37] Bitcoin education through for example um
[15:41] I don't know doing courses like me
[15:43] premere Bitcoin right being very very
[15:45] popular example of that secondly we have
[15:49] projects that are about Bitcoin culture
[15:51] Bitcoin culture kind of creative people
[15:53] and so you here you have a ton of
[15:55] documentaries that are raising funds
[15:57] there's a really a cool new one called
[16:00] No More
[16:01] inflation um by shooter and he's raised
[16:05] now
[16:07] $6,000 um uh by selling tickets uh by
[16:11] selling
[16:12] sponsorships and things like that you
[16:14] also have games right that also related
[16:18] to education but like block Hunters is
[16:20] has sold around
[16:23] 67,000 worth of of um uh board games uh
[16:29] that he's hasn't created yet he's kind
[16:32] of he's basically working on them and
[16:36] people are pre- buing it um and then
[16:39] this this game really allows you to have
[16:41] fun uh educate people uh have a good
[16:44] time with friends and family and orange
[16:46] pill orange pill people and uh and then
[16:50] a third category is Bitcoin communities
[16:54] um and this is where you
[16:56] have uh Bitcoin citadels or Bitcoin
[17:01] circular
[17:02] economies one really big one was let's
[17:06] see
[17:08] here one big one might be yeah it's
[17:12] really hard to point point there's so
[17:14] many there's so many it might be a
[17:16] Meetup it might be like a workshop uh
[17:18] some people even try to start start up
[17:20] conferences to see if there's interest
[17:21] in that uh but uh usually smaller scale
[17:26] meetups Workshop where people can say
[17:28] like pitch in some SATs to buy a venue
[17:31] or things like that and so Bitcoin
[17:33] communities Bitcoin culture and Bitcoin
[17:36] education are the key big the big uh the
[17:39] big ones you also then have humanitarian
[17:42] projects um like we had the the
[17:44] earthquake in in Turkey earlier this
[17:47] year that raised quite a bit you then
[17:49] have project in Gaza that is supporting
[17:52] victims of um you know victims of the
[17:56] bombings um and you also just have all
[17:59] sorts of things like you have a big one
[18:01] also called defend the proof of work and
[18:04] it's basically supporting legal experts
[18:08] in pushing back against proof of work
[18:11] mining ban in Europe um and they raise
[18:15] yeah almost $2,000 obviously much more
[18:17] is needed so if you care about
[18:21] Bitcoin if you want Bitcoin to succeed
[18:24] looking at geyser and seeing what
[18:27] projects there are is a very very good
[18:30] way of supporting the Bitcoin
[18:33] ecosystem uh hling is great we all love
[18:36] it but if we don't support Bitcoin
[18:39] initiatives around the
[18:40] world it's GNA be hard we have to
[18:43] support each other we have to support
[18:47] creators that are adding value to
[18:48] bitcoin and the best way to do that is
[18:51] by departing with some of our Bitcoin
[18:53] showcasing their support and like I said
[18:57] even you know every counts even 21 SATs
[19:01] uh can help a Creator feel like oh well
[19:04] so what I'm doing is is valuable people
[19:07] recognizing my Worth right so um Gaza
[19:11] just makes it super easy for people to
[19:12] launch your projects and makes it super
[19:14] easy for people to support them um and
[19:18] to see the project come to life grow and
[19:21] see that history of uh the history of of
[19:24] of of transactions and the history of of
[19:28] proof of work work that the project has
[19:29] put in um that the creator has put into
[19:32] the project so yeah it's really know
[19:36] really G Geer help support projects help
[19:39] launch your
[19:40] ideas it's an an amazing initiative um
[19:44] what I thinking right now is can guysa
[19:47] because most Bitcoin companies out there
[19:50] that are bigger like Rel and stuff like
[19:53] that they are usually Venture Capital
[19:56] backed uh not all of them some them vure
[20:00] Capital back some are like organically
[20:02] grown it depends on the business model
[20:03] and stuff like that can Gea in the in
[20:06] the future also I mean I know venture
[20:08] capital is different from like
[20:11] crowdfunding but can Gea and
[20:13] crowdfunding be even helpful to uh raise
[20:17] capital for a company in the
[20:20] future absolutely so we already are
[20:22] seeing a lot of open- source projects on
[20:25] Geyser that are launching their ideas as
[20:27] a way to
[20:30] showcase if there is interest in it
[20:32] right and then a few of these projects
[20:34] actually for example orange pill app you
[20:36] did you know do you know about orang app
[20:38] yeah yeah yeah yeah for example they
[20:40] launched their project on
[20:42] Geyser as a way of seeing and testing if
[20:45] there's interest in their application
[20:46] and so they they pre-old like
[20:50] 50 50 subscriptions to the app before
[20:53] the app was launched on Geyser and so
[20:57] they use geyser as a way to see if they
[20:58] was interest in their products they did
[21:01] that they launched the app then they
[21:03] rais funds funds from from investors
[21:05] right so absolutely there are a lot of
[21:08] even open- Source projects that are
[21:10] launching getting donations and then
[21:12] they go to say hrf they go to some of
[21:15] the big granty Grant holders and then
[21:18] they say look I have this great product
[21:21] the community loves it look at that
[21:22] people are even donating donating on
[21:24] Geyser to keep it alive so um so
[21:28] absolutely guess really way to connect a
[21:30] project to its community of of create of
[21:35] followers and it's um it also just
[21:39] surfacing the the crowd surfacing
[21:42] through social logins through
[21:45] recognition through you know
[21:48] contributions um showcasing who is
[21:50] funding kind of bringing that social
[21:52] layer together with a with a monetary
[21:55] layer when we uh zoom out like I don't
[21:59] know 50 years or like 100 years uh can
[22:03] this be uh launching a completely new
[22:07] kind of economy where uh every project
[22:10] that is uh out there started on like
[22:14] something on a P2P network uh and is
[22:17] started on like a crowdfunding platform
[22:19] like geyser and is basically
[22:23] decentralizing um the I think a lot
[22:27] about for example when we take um
[22:29] podcasting and social media in general
[22:32] in the earlier days where there was no
[22:33] social media there was just television
[22:35] networks you have to go like climb a
[22:37] career lad to get like the the position
[22:40] in the to be a host in some TV show now
[22:42] everybody can just host a TV show on
[22:45] YouTube on all the X on platforms and
[22:49] then additionally to that the platforms
[22:51] also pay them like X and YouTube they
[22:54] pay then you have also value for Value
[22:57] uh this podcast has some supporters on
[23:00] Fountain this is also funding the the
[23:03] the podcast itself can fund other
[23:05] projects and then you also have for
[23:08] projects but also for creaters Geyser um
[23:12] I'm just wondering what you think will
[23:14] happen like in the next when we really
[23:16] have a broad uh sense of like 50 years
[23:19] out I mean it's always hard to look out
[23:22] that far but do we have any idea like
[23:24] how this can can
[23:27] evolve yeah man good question I love the
[23:29] question not an easy question I love it
[23:33] uh yeah so 50 100 years you know it's
[23:37] GNA be unimaginable I think any attempt
[23:40] to just think something crazy and and
[23:44] just say it's gonna be much crazier than
[23:46] that that's how that's how crazy it's
[23:47] gonna be you know my my
[23:51] feeling what if you
[23:53] could you know what if you could IPO
[23:55] right like what if a Creator could IPO
[23:58] right sell equity and every money every
[24:02] sat that you receive a percentage of
[24:04] which it goes
[24:06] to the owners of of your stock right so
[24:09] you um right you you you Robin right you
[24:14] have your podcast you have you end up
[24:16] you know 50 years having 100,000
[24:19] followers you know daily
[24:22] viewers and some people say purchased
[24:26] like 10% of your entire
[24:30] uh dividends sorry 10% of your of your
[24:32] equity for for your project and then
[24:35] every zap that you get every every
[24:38] everything you receive and you sell will
[24:40] go to the 10% of people that the 10% of
[24:43] of your your stockholders and I think
[24:47] something like that could help
[24:49] bootstrap um help you like monetize
[24:52] early on and the people that believe in
[24:55] your idea could help
[24:57] you uh make it and not just through
[25:00] donations but by by getting something
[25:03] back in return for for your your your
[25:06] effort and for their Vision they're also
[25:08] they they also have to see the vision
[25:10] and buy into it so I think donations are
[25:13] are very powerful value for Value but I
[25:16] think if I think
[25:18] forward there will be things built on
[25:20] top you know the first thing on top of
[25:21] donations is just giving something back
[25:24] like you know getting something back
[25:26] like for example getting a sponsorship
[25:28] right or getting a a ticket before the
[25:31] the before the goods are even there but
[25:34] pre- buying pre-ordering
[25:36] something uh then it's buying when if a
[25:39] product is ready you can buy it already
[25:41] but then there's maybe lending and then
[25:44] there is equity and and now Equity is a
[25:48] tool that is super complicated it's
[25:51] super it's it's a bit like what you said
[25:53] with Television right to have a TV show
[25:55] you had to be ex it's exclusive you have
[25:57] to go to the channels and centralized
[26:00] channels and now anyone can be a
[26:02] podcaster anyone can be a YouTuber um
[26:05] and have more
[26:07] audience than mainstream media so
[26:11] imagine the same thing apply to equity
[26:13] where Equity right now is like equities
[26:16] we are not you know we're taught to
[26:17] think oh Equity is bad and IPOs are bad
[26:20] and and um and VCS are bad um the
[26:25] reality is the equity is a financial
[26:27] tool that's been captured by the state
[26:29] as well uh it's has to go through
[26:32] regulations it has to go through the SEC
[26:35] gets to Define right and also says
[26:37] threshold so it's imp it's really really
[26:40] difficult to buy Equity into a
[26:43] company uh peer-to-peer if it's less
[26:47] than
[26:48] $25,000 you have to go through a
[26:49] Syndicate if you want to pay if you want
[26:52] to buy $1,000 worth of equity and good
[26:55] good luck trying to get Equity by
[26:57] spending
[26:59] half a cent or $1 there's no way you
[27:02] could do that but I think with
[27:04] technology being what it is a
[27:06] democratizing tool that just is
[27:07] deflationary and reduces prices for
[27:10] everything I suspect that's going to be
[27:12] the next big thing I think the next
[27:14] thing will be just like the fact that
[27:16] Equity gets the the cost of issuing the
[27:19] cost of uh buying uh the cost of
[27:22] redeeming uh dividends for Equity is
[27:26] just going to go you know like crazy the
[27:29] problem is you know shitcoins try to do
[27:32] that um by shuing tokens you know the
[27:36] issuance of
[27:37] tokens um the funny thing though is that
[27:40] they issued tokens and then they called
[27:43] them uh they call them uh utility for
[27:46] like voting rights and uh uh what did
[27:50] they call them as well they call them
[27:51] well I forget what the exact terminology
[27:53] they use but any case most tokens to
[27:55] remain compliant were just voting rights
[27:57] they didn't have any dividends uh
[28:00] dividend issuing capacities but that's
[28:04] the that's the point of it that's the
[28:05] beauty of it is that if you have an idea
[28:06] you can then share the rewards back with
[28:08] the holders and so so basically
[28:10] shitcoins did Equity done wrong because
[28:12] they had to still work with the equity
[28:15] system as it is but I do think that by
[28:18] doing equity in a more decentralized way
[28:20] we can take even Equity out of the hands
[28:22] of governments uh there's some really
[28:25] interesting projects out there that try
[28:26] to do that on Noster like rocket if
[28:29] you're interested in looking more into
[28:31] that um G sovereignty is doing some
[28:34] pretty awesome things in there uh we're
[28:37] looking hopefully guys there may be a
[28:39] place where creators could could do that
[28:42] in the future uh in a in a way done well
[28:45] and again we we we want to remain
[28:47] neutral and just a platform that makes
[28:49] it easy for you to do that but um
[28:51] eventually creators like yourself should
[28:53] be able to to use all Financial tools
[28:55] under the spal if they have an idea and
[28:57] people can you know want to believe and
[29:00] have a part of that idea then then why
[29:03] not I'm super excited to announced that
[29:06] this podcast got the first ever sponsor
[29:10] 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one
[29:14] and they teach and preach self custody
[29:17] this is my goto exchange when someone
[29:20] asks me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin
[29:22] from this is the easiest entry for
[29:25] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[29:28] Plus at the same time support this
[29:30] podcast use code Robin and click the
[29:33] link in the description I mean it would
[29:35] be really awesome like just just me like
[29:38] when we take now my example of my
[29:40] podcast I just started out in in
[29:42] December so it's really early on and
[29:44] there are still like uh I think uh each
[29:48] episode gets around 1,000 listeners so
[29:51] uh just imagining uh having those
[29:55] listeners uh giving giving them a way to
[29:59] contribute to the podcast supporting the
[30:01] podcast supporting the show and in
[30:04] addition to that uh getting a small
[30:06] share in the podcast where when the
[30:09] podcast is getting big and the media is
[30:11] getting big um they're getting rewarded
[30:14] for being an early supporter we we all
[30:18] have those those people like oh I
[30:20] subscribed to Mr Beast when he was under
[30:22] 10,000 followers yeah but what do you
[30:24] get from that nothing you get yeah and
[30:28] and and that would be I think an an
[30:31] interesting way but I
[30:33] think it's also an in dangerous route
[30:36] where there can be like a lot of
[30:38] coining because then all of the sudden
[30:40] creators make like tokens and then they
[30:43] sell it and then they like yeah do that
[30:45] that's the problem right that's the
[30:47] problem but I do wonder if there's ways
[30:49] to do it without without the equ without
[30:51] the token right I mean I mean a token
[30:54] essentially yeah that's a good question
[30:57] there may be ways so I mean Equity
[30:59] maybe may be required right because if I
[31:02] own a percentage of of Robin your show
[31:05] and then after a bit I'm like okay I'm
[31:07] done with it I I want to probably be
[31:08] able to to sell it in some form um or
[31:12] maybe not maybe maybe the beauty of it
[31:14] is that it remains tokenless and if I
[31:17] purchased it then I burn it burns um
[31:20] yeah I don't know but I agree with you
[31:23] there's definitely that's the that's the
[31:26] danger right uh is that it becomes get
[31:28] gambling Mania out of sorts but I think
[31:31] the problem though is that the problem
[31:33] of tokens and shitcoins is that they
[31:35] were diversed from the dividends the
[31:38] only way to make money from a shitcoin
[31:40] is by selling it again because I think
[31:42] that the shitcoin will never give you uh
[31:45] Equity never give you dividends because
[31:48] otherwise it's a security and so most
[31:49] tokens don't don't do that um if that
[31:52] makes sense some try some try and then
[31:56] you know they get shut down again
[31:58] uh so yeah I think by making dividends
[32:02] the heart of an idea which is you know
[32:05] you get you get a percentage of all the
[32:06] flows that go into your project for a
[32:09] certain
[32:10] time you make it about not the
[32:13] ownership of the not the value of the
[32:16] token it's more about the
[32:19] dividends that come back to you for
[32:21] certain time
[32:23] period it's an definitely an interesting
[32:25] field I think field that is not not
[32:28] really developed uh till now like
[32:30] applications like Gea and other
[32:33] platforms uh I think still those are
[32:36] really early and we just see a small
[32:39] window what can happen what are the
[32:42] possibilities on that and also for
[32:44] creators demonetization for projects
[32:47] demonetization for how we want to defend
[32:51] like even political like when we say we
[32:53] want to um have a defense against
[32:57] European Banning the European Union
[33:00] Banning stuff this is like a politically
[33:02] force that is built on a decentralized
[33:05] network fighting against something the
[33:08] the possibilities are now like small
[33:11] small building and I think we're just
[33:13] seeing small steps and we cannot even
[33:16] imagine how big this will be in like 10
[33:18] years it it's an ex exciting time to be
[33:21] alive and and see this Evolution U
[33:24] evolving um we talked a little bit about
[33:27] uh coining and uh and uh I'm always
[33:32] interested in the origin story of
[33:34] someone's Bitcoin like how to to you get
[33:37] to bitcoin especially if people like
[33:41] yourself are building applications on
[33:43] top of Bitcoin like their uh their
[33:46] confidence level went beyond just
[33:49] holding it they want to be fully in the
[33:52] ecosystem uh and like where is this
[33:54] motivation coming from where was your
[33:56] Bitcoin origence Story Probably there's
[33:59] also a shitcoin phase or could you could
[34:02] you move around
[34:03] that a few are moving around I'm not one
[34:08] of the lucky ones I definitely have my
[34:09] shitcoin phas um but no for me I so I
[34:15] studied anthropology and economics which
[34:18] is quite unusual by by having a a double
[34:22] sorry what's anthropology anthropology
[34:25] anthropology is a bit like sociology
[34:28] it's a bit like sociology uh but more
[34:30] interested in say like indigenous
[34:33] societies and U say like archaeology as
[34:36] well so anthropology is fascinating
[34:40] study and it's all about kind of culture
[34:42] understanding culture and why culture
[34:44] defers across countries um the problem
[34:47] with anthropology though is is um
[34:50] there's many problems with it but one of
[34:52] them is that it's it's always very
[34:54] subjective it's especially this kind of
[34:56] modern way anthropology is all like
[34:59] relativist right so there's everything
[35:01] is relative you can't say anything is
[35:03] better than any another thing um and so
[35:07] and their understanding of money is
[35:08] basically zero like money is just you
[35:12] know uh not really considered as a as um
[35:17] as something worth worth worth studying
[35:19] or wor analyzing deeply um uh although
[35:23] it is you know very
[35:26] powerful a fundamental
[35:28] thing in in like Humanity the the rise
[35:31] of civilization and evolution human
[35:35] human flourishing um but there are some
[35:38] Anthropologist that really Tri kind of
[35:40] really interested me like Henry um Lou
[35:43] Henry Morgan as a very very very you
[35:46] know old Anthropologist that was
[35:49] Anthropologist still make fun of today
[35:50] but you know was really powerful in this
[35:54] idea that trying to understand Humanity
[35:56] from an objective standpoint
[35:58] um so they kind of coin objectivism
[36:00] because it's not relative it's you know
[36:02] objective seeing Humanity kind of
[36:04] flourishing through time through the use
[36:06] of technology and so technology was you
[36:11] know um so when it comes
[36:13] to then economics uh economics had also
[36:17] had all sorts of problems but I hated
[36:20] anthrop I hated economics more
[36:22] anthropology because economics in fact
[36:24] the two of them said always opposite
[36:26] things um but economics says everything
[36:28] is great but when in reality like the
[36:32] world around us doesn't follow economic
[36:34] the principles that are taught in an
[36:35] economic school at all um again in
[36:39] economics people talk about Austrian
[36:41] economics being you know a bad idea uh
[36:45] uh anthropologists didn't like econom
[36:47] Austrian economists for some re reason
[36:51] um while for fact reality there are a
[36:54] lot of
[36:55] similarities but in any case I I went
[36:57] through after University I ended up
[36:59] working for a nonprofit in in Nepal and
[37:02] I ended up trying to busily working in
[37:05] in this field and and in remote areas of
[37:08] the country in Nepal after the
[37:10] earthquake to understand like what were
[37:11] the problems of the of these people and
[37:13] what we realized that there were a lot
[37:15] of people that had no toilets in these
[37:19] rural areas had you know barely paved
[37:22] roads but guess what they had they had
[37:24] their smartphones they had their
[37:26] smartphones that they used to
[37:27] communicate with their friends and
[37:29] family on the other side of the world
[37:31] and they would work
[37:33] say in Dubai or in Sri Lanka or whatever
[37:37] doing all sorts of tough jobs but they
[37:40] would be to call back they to send money
[37:42] back and I was blown away at just how
[37:46] powerful uh technology was in in lifting
[37:50] up these people that are living you know
[37:53] with very little and yet technology was
[37:56] a tool that they were able to kind of uh
[37:58] rise and be empowered to so I was just
[38:02] Blown Away about and that really made me
[38:04] reconsider the role of technology is a
[38:07] fantastic tool for emancipating Humanity
[38:09] as a whole and especially those at the
[38:11] bottom and then after that I I
[38:13] discovered Bitcoin I discovered Bitcoin
[38:15] uh um mainly on on Twitter and I Tri I
[38:20] understood that you know this thing was
[38:22] not going away that this is a money that
[38:25] is borderless permissionless
[38:28] um and eventually
[38:30] also that was um yeah that had the store
[38:35] of value property that is being taken
[38:37] out of money so Bitcoin helped me
[38:39] re-evaluate a lot of what I had learned
[38:41] in school uh economics a lot of that had
[38:45] to go down the trash anthropology a lot
[38:48] of it had to go down the trash but
[38:50] anthropology helped me enter the mindset
[38:53] of a bitcoiner because I was like okay
[38:55] these bitcoiners are either crazy
[38:58] or they discovered something really
[38:59] really powerful really really important
[39:02] and and so then I ended up doing some
[39:05] research into into into
[39:07] bitcoiners um I did a survey did some
[39:10] interviews with some people that are in
[39:11] the Bitcoin Community to try to
[39:13] understand what what's the belief system
[39:14] of the Bitcoin or crowd and with that I
[39:17] understood that there was something here
[39:20] the Bitcoin standard help to cement it
[39:23] Bitcoin is fundamentally revolutionary
[39:27] techn te ology that actually isn't
[39:29] revolutionary at all because it brings
[39:30] us back to to Nature it brings us back
[39:33] to hard money which is something that's
[39:35] existed for for a long
[39:37] time and then with that I then yeah I
[39:40] did did look into ethereum and other
[39:42] cryptos and obviously you buy Bitcoin
[39:44] and you have to buy them in these
[39:46] shitcoin casinos we end up getting
[39:49] confused um but um but eventually I
[39:53] snapped out of that I real what am I
[39:55] doing this makes no sense um this has
[39:57] you know no utility um and so yeah ended
[40:01] up just focusing more on on bitcoin I
[40:04] ended up working for a company that then
[40:08] pivoted to to ethereum and so uh I was
[40:11] able to kind of for a year and a half
[40:13] kind of dive in the world of startups
[40:15] and see what was going on in in the
[40:17] ethereum
[40:18] ecosystem um and I wanted to try to be
[40:21] open-minded but the reality is it was
[40:24] just as bad as I had imagined it would
[40:25] be it just e doesn't you know has insane
[40:29] aborting fees it didn't work very well
[40:32] obviously I got to learn more about how
[40:33] it's just not decentralized at all um
[40:37] Cloud servers nodes that nobody knows
[40:40] how much ethereum there really is and
[40:42] also the the secondary layers that were
[40:44] just horrible like the secondary layers
[40:48] on top of ethereum that don't speak to
[40:49] each other that have their own tokens
[40:51] that are their own blockchains made no
[40:54] sense whatsoever and meanwhile there was
[40:57] lightning I was running my node I was
[40:59] like this is insane how is nobody
[41:00] building this how is all this being
[41:03] buil on these
[41:05] coins and no one's building a lightning
[41:08] and so I realized that you know
[41:10] something needed to be done about that I
[41:12] realized that there were so many
[41:13] bitcoiners that were coming up with cool
[41:15] ideas and cool things and people were
[41:17] sending QR codes uh on Twitter
[41:20] and it you know
[41:21] really really bothered me it just didn't
[41:23] seem like a good way a good user
[41:25] experience for me to fund other projects
[41:27] and so yeah so I I I talked to stos a
[41:31] friend of mine that I've been speaking
[41:33] to we met on Twitter uh another
[41:35] bitcoiner and together we decided to put
[41:38] together a small proof of concept to see
[41:40] if there might be interest and yeah few
[41:43] months four months we're able to put
[41:45] something out
[41:46] there and this project this guy in
[41:49] Nigeria called AATA who wanted to do a
[41:52] workshop uh for for his community to
[41:55] talk to them about Bitcoin and in just
[41:57] two weeks he received few thousand
[41:59] dollars from a hundred different people
[42:01] from all around the world and we
[42:04] realized that there was something here
[42:05] that there is no that using the existing
[42:09] tools there's just no solution to it um
[42:13] and so yeah so Geer really was BN uh
[42:16] like that it's an amazing um um story
[42:20] for for guysa also it shows I think the
[42:24] demand is just coming and it's just
[42:26] piling up slowly and it it will come uh
[42:30] even more I think this this this es
[42:32] adoption for all those uh for Bitcoin
[42:35] itself but also all the applications on
[42:37] top of Bitcoin is just really coming to
[42:40] to to build up um I have one interesting
[42:44] question that might be interesting also
[42:46] for the listeners but is a selfish
[42:49] selfish question to ask for me um do you
[42:52] have an advice for me or advice for how
[42:56] I can have projects or what would be the
[43:00] best way for me to have projects on Gea
[43:03] to um yeah monetize my podcast to be
[43:07] have projects on for the podcast uh on
[43:11] there or in general for for
[43:14] podcast yeah so I I absolutely uh happy
[43:17] to give advice
[43:19] so I think there are some projects on
[43:22] Geyser that you can learn from I think
[43:23] the best way to learn is from example
[43:26] and there are some really cool projects
[43:27] on Geyser like example the progressive
[43:30] bitcoiner and he's raised he's now been
[43:33] on Geyser
[43:35] uh
[43:37] since June 2023 so it's been yeah like
[43:42] around 8 months and he's raised
[43:46] $1,600 so it's not you know it's not
[43:49] revolutionary but it can be a good
[43:51] addition to what you receive from sa
[43:54] Fountain Geer is free to use if you
[43:56] connect your node or if you connect your
[43:59] lightning you can also connect your
[44:00] lightning address whether it's on blck
[44:02] blink W satosi you know uh stripe or bit
[44:07] knob or Al or whatever uh so that way
[44:11] you don't have to manage your liquidity
[44:13] it's a lot easier in that case you take
[44:15] a small percent fee it's around 2% at
[44:17] the moment um but yeah guys ends up
[44:20] being a really good complement I think
[44:22] to say fountains uh uh
[44:25] streams uh I think actually Citadel
[44:27] dispatches also on Geyser he raised
[44:29] quite a bit as well and I think we've
[44:32] seen that in ter we could actually you
[44:33] actually if you connect your
[44:35] node the same node that is using U
[44:39] podcasting podcast key transactions you
[44:41] can actually visualize on guer the
[44:43] percentage of transaction that coming
[44:45] coming through Fountain versus through
[44:47] geyser through well through podcasting
[44:50] in general versus geyser and geyser is
[44:53] usually around 60% of donations because
[44:55] on found on on podcasting you're like
[44:59] tapping tapping app and you often have
[45:02] to use your own wallet inside the
[45:05] podcasting
[45:06] system uh while in Geer you can send
[45:08] funds from onchain you can send fun
[45:10] funds from your any wallet you know uh
[45:13] on Lightning so you don't have to send
[45:15] gun funds to guys or to fund and as a
[45:17] result you end up funding a lot more so
[45:20] I would just
[45:21] recommend put yourself out there try it
[45:25] out learn through it let us know you
[45:27] what you think let us know how we can
[45:29] improve because we're we're here with
[45:30] you guys to learn and
[45:32] improve and uh and that and also just
[45:35] don't don't don't be shy to ask for
[45:38] donations right the pro the biggest
[45:40] problem uh is that people don't don't
[45:42] know and don't ask for for support um
[45:47] now you can also sell rewards on guys or
[45:50] you can sell sponsorships so it's super
[45:52] easy just to say hey I have this podcast
[45:55] check out this sponsorship packet
[45:57] uh and you know i' be happy to feature
[46:00] you the sponsor gets featured there on
[46:02] your page as well so they get recognized
[46:03] through your page there's many ways you
[46:06] can sell merch um you can share updates
[46:10] and so it's really becomes like that
[46:12] place where you project can come alive
[46:14] and you can get people to easily uh
[46:16] support support support you and also
[46:19] recognize contributors because problem
[46:21] is what we realize is
[46:23] that uh Creator contributors funders
[46:27] want to be recognized if they're giving
[46:29] you $100 it would be nice to have for
[46:32] them it would be nice for them to be to
[46:34] be to have their profile social profile
[46:36] showcased so that you know they can feel
[46:39] like you know I've contributed to this
[46:41] worthy Bitcoin cause I get Social
[46:43] recognition for it you can also sell
[46:45] noobster badges on Geyser you can sell
[46:47] all sorts of things so really it's about
[46:50] putting yourself out there trying trying
[46:52] it out uh don't be shy about asking uh
[46:57] um and yeah just think about guer being
[46:59] a tool for you for you as a Creator to
[47:02] uh to help you monetize and recognize
[47:05] your community and that's an amazing
[47:07] advice and I think uh the podcast will
[47:10] come out in three four weeks and I might
[47:12] just start with that podcast small
[47:15] project and let's see how it how it
[47:17] works out and uh monetization for me is
[47:20] a part where I'm like first it was not
[47:23] at all uh an a focus of mine and just
[47:27] like created for like years years like
[47:29] one and a half years now uh and I had my
[47:31] Fe job but uh since January uh I
[47:35] starting to see um um monetization from
[47:38] from the platforms uh from also from
[47:41] Fountain uh but the main part was like
[47:43] that uh sponsor that is now sponsoring
[47:47] the podcast with 21 Bitcoin uh is
[47:49] supporting me so now I'm in the
[47:51] transition phase of actually doing that
[47:54] fulltime uh and I will from from next
[47:58] week onwards fulltime so um yeah
[48:01] monetization is now something that
[48:03] allows me to bring even more and even
[48:05] more quality content for for my
[48:08] community and I think I I I changed my
[48:10] view on monetization in the last few
[48:13] months because I see it's like it's it's
[48:15] it's good for the listeners and for the
[48:18] uh creers itself to have even better um
[48:22] projects coming out from that so with
[48:25] that we we're coming slow to the to the
[48:27] end and we having an interesting end
[48:29] routine and this this one is actually
[48:31] interesting where we have a question
[48:34] from the previous guest going to to the
[48:36] next guest uh and the previous guest was
[48:40] not uh a full bitco like he is a full
[48:44] bitcoiner he understands everything uh
[48:46] but he's not uh like his his his brand
[48:49] and his recognition is not focused on
[48:51] bitcoin he's just happens to be also a
[48:54] bitcoiner what to what he does and he
[48:56] had a question
[48:57] about ordinal I will read the whole
[49:00] question how he how he asked it because
[49:03] it's I think the longest question I ever
[49:05] had uh but then we can go over it what
[49:08] what you think about that topic uh given
[49:10] that Bitcoin given that the Bitcoin
[49:13] blockchain is fundamentally a message
[49:14] sending device that was first used for
[49:17] exchanging money allowances between
[49:20] accounts isn't it a natural and legitim
[49:23] legitimate extension of its
[49:25] functionality to allow it to carry
[49:28] ordinance which are also messages across
[49:31] senders and
[49:33] receivers so basically yeah about
[49:37] ordinance yeah yeah my answer to that
[49:39] would be that he sort of answered it
[49:42] himself because he said that it's he
[49:45] says Bitcoin is a protocol for sending
[49:47] messages but then he says that uh it's
[49:50] messages about money so to my mind
[49:54] Bitcoin as a protocol is a monetary
[49:57] Network for sharing financial
[49:59] information and not arbitrary
[50:03] information of any kind that's that's
[50:05] sort of my perspective um you don't see
[50:09] people sending photos across the Sapa
[50:13] Network you don't see people
[50:18] sending Tweets
[50:20] across the what was before protocol
[50:23] which is Mastercard or VISA it just it
[50:27] was financial
[50:28] information right and so back in the day
[50:31] something like ordinal would have and
[50:33] actually were eliminated as a as a as as
[50:35] a form because it it would have been
[50:37] considered spam as in outside the remit
[50:39] of the
[50:41] monetary the monetary messages the
[50:45] monetary information that needs to be
[50:46] transferred so that's why I I'm in the
[50:48] camp
[50:49] that I don't know I think they were able
[50:52] to pass this through but my my feeling
[50:55] is it's spam
[50:57] uh in that Bitcoin is yeah sure it's a
[50:59] Marketplace for anything but it could be
[51:01] an attack Vector for Bitcoin it could it
[51:03] could lead Bitcoin to fail um I'm not
[51:06] I'm not I'm not I'm not sure the
[51:08] solution is is a hard for I hope we
[51:10] don't get there um but I do think uh we
[51:15] have to learn about what is what is
[51:18] bitcoin and in my mind it's it's
[51:21] Financial messages there's so many other
[51:24] tools you could use Liquid you could use
[51:27] uh you could use um RGB which is is
[51:31] better can scale arbitrary information
[51:35] but it just feels like graffitis and
[51:37] some people love graffitis um some
[51:40] graffitis are awesome but it just just
[51:43] feels like spam to me yeah it's I very
[51:46] much agree with that and uh it's it's
[51:48] interesting because I think it's
[51:50] actually an attack on on bitcoin it
[51:52] could be considered an attack on bitcoin
[51:54] uh but at the end of the day it's just
[51:57] one of these things that test the
[51:59] Bitcoin Network as we had already so
[52:02] many times with everything and if
[52:06] Bitcoin cannot survive that in whatever
[52:09] form it can survive that then it was
[52:11] never that what we thought it is so I am
[52:14] really confident that uh this this is
[52:17] just another uh um attack on bitcoin I
[52:21] think the the biggest one was 2017 with
[52:23] the blze wars and this one is
[52:27] uh as as I from my small objective
[52:30] opinion I think a smaller one uh but
[52:34] yeah it could be interesting what we
[52:36] what what road we are going down there
[52:38] like there's a lot of different opinions
[52:40] that Bitcoin the Bitcoin crowd is
[52:41] getting bigger and bigger and with the
[52:44] crowd and Community getting bigger of
[52:46] course also the opinions are getting um
[52:49] more diverse and yeah I think basically
[52:51] a good good thing in the end of the day
[52:53] but also can lead to some some problems
[52:56] there
[52:57] yeah so uh thank you Mick for for being
