[00:00] Bitcoin gives you the ability to capture
[00:02] all your lifetime earnings and put it in
[00:04] your head and then move across borders.
[00:05] So, we've never seen that before. It's
[00:07] it's the first of its kind. Um, in that
[00:08] case, another use case for Bitcoin would
[00:10] be collateral. Bitcoin is perfect and
[00:12] pristine collateral unlike anything
[00:13] we've ever seen before. But, I look at
[00:15] Bitcoin as uh a little bit more d-risk.
[00:17] So, I look at risk a little bit
[00:19] differently. I really, you know,
[00:20] Bitcoin's conditioned me to do this, but
[00:21] I look at risk more so through
[00:23] counterparty risk. We're so comfortable
[00:25] in the West with taking on so much
[00:27] counterparty risk. And I think Bitcoin's
[00:28] kind of shaken that comfort for me, if
[00:30] that makes sense. Overall, I would say
[00:32] the the over-encompassing value prop
[00:34] would be savings technology, long-term
[00:36] savings technology for Bitcoin.
[00:40] [Music]
[00:42] How would you define the intrinsic value
[00:44] of of Bitcoin? I don't I don't think
[00:46] that there is a such thing as intrinsic
[00:48] value. That's that's my belief. Um I
[00:51] don't think anything has inherent value.
[00:53] So, an example I like to bring up, say
[00:55] you're stranded in the desert, okay? A
[00:57] billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, a
[00:58] billion dollars worth of gold, a billion
[01:00] dollars worth of oil, no matter what it
[01:01] is. How valuable is that going to be to
[01:03] you in that moment? Probably not too
[01:05] valuable, you know, versus two gallons
[01:07] of fresh, cool, clean drinking water,
[01:09] you know, that's going to be worth
[01:10] everything to you or food. So, it really
[01:13] is I think value is very subjective. It
[01:15] is based on the circumstances and and
[01:17] the desires and the needs of the
[01:18] individual. Um, I don't believe in
[01:20] intrinsic value. Uh what I think when
[01:23] people say intrinsic value, I think
[01:25] they're conflating intrinsic and
[01:27] industrial. I think they're conflating
[01:28] those two terms. So when you say gold
[01:31] has intrinsic value, I think what
[01:32] they're saying is gold has industrial
[01:34] value. It has industrial use case. We
[01:36] use it in aerospace. We use it in
[01:37] automotive, in jewelry. Gold has a
[01:40] myriad of use cases outside of money,
[01:42] outside of its monetization. So I think
[01:44] when people talk about intrinsic value,
[01:46] they're really talking about industrial
[01:48] value, which in my opinion and in other
[01:50] people's opinions, Bitcoin doesn't
[01:51] really have um that in industrial value,
[01:54] so to say. Um Bitcoin functions as
[01:56] money. It functions as savings
[01:57] technology. Um it is pure pristine money
[02:00] with no other use cases other than that
[02:02] of money. So that's kind of what you
[02:04] know interests me about uh intrinsic
[02:06] value and Bitcoin. I really don't think
[02:08] that intrinsic value exists. I think
[02:10] value is subjective all around. So
[02:12] there's no such thing as uh something
[02:14] has an intrinsic value is always uh
[02:17] subject to the context of the situation
[02:20] and to the person because I could have
[02:23] uh I don't know and maybe it's actually
[02:26] a good uh um example. I could have an uh
[02:30] a gold coin or an art piece or anything
[02:32] that I have um a lot of emotional value
[02:36] and I'm like okay I never want to sell
[02:38] this because it has some emotional
[02:40] value. There's a price tag on that which
[02:43] might be I don't know a thousand euros.
[02:45] Uh but that's not the intrinsic value
[02:47] for me. The intrinsic value for me is
[02:49] the emotional value. But it does not
[02:50] really has value on its own. It has a
[02:53] price tag. And I think that that's what
[02:55] a lot of people also conflict with with
[02:57] Bitcoin. Like what's the intrinsic value
[02:59] of Bitcoin? Like there is none and
[03:01] nothing else was intrinsic value.
[03:03] Absolutely. And as you described that
[03:04] would be sentimental value. So that
[03:06] those gold coins to you have sentimental
[03:07] value and that's that's fine. But that
[03:09] is, you know, different from the
[03:10] argument that people make for intrinsic
[03:11] value. So I I agree sentimental value,
[03:14] you know, you have had a coin, a gold
[03:15] coin passed down that has serious
[03:17] sentimental value that might be higher
[03:19] than its spot price. So, you know, that
[03:21] would dictate that you would keep that
[03:22] money um or or that coin or collectible,
[03:25] whatever whatever it may be. Um so yeah,
[03:27] I don't I don't think uh I think value
[03:29] is really subjective. It all depends on
[03:31] where you are and and the desires and
[03:32] needs of the individual. How do we value
[03:35] Bitcoin then?
[03:37] So, Bitcoin, so although it, like I
[03:39] said, it doesn't have industrial value,
[03:41] it does have value. So, I'm not saying
[03:42] Bitcoin doesn't have value. Of course,
[03:44] it has value. We're in the middle of
[03:45] price discovery right now. So, we're
[03:46] we're the market is collectively trying
[03:48] to figure out what this thing is worth,
[03:49] what this thing is, and what it's worth.
[03:51] So, one, so in the west, uh, how we
[03:53] value Bitcoin, I would say the biggest
[03:55] use case, if you want to use that word,
[03:57] would be savings technology. I think
[03:59] storing your value across time and space
[04:01] is the biggest use case as a westerner,
[04:03] um, for for Bitcoin. Uh, another
[04:05] jurisdiction uh, use case may be, you
[04:08] know, that jurisdiction is is not great
[04:10] and you're looking to flee. So, you
[04:12] know, Bitcoin gives you the ability to
[04:14] capture all your lifetime earnings and
[04:16] put it in your head and then move across
[04:17] borders. So, we've never seen that
[04:19] before. It's it's the first of its kind.
[04:21] Um, in that case, another use case for
[04:23] Bitcoin would be collateral. Uh, Bitcoin
[04:25] is perfect and pristine collateral
[04:26] unlike anything we've ever seen before.
[04:28] Um, we're not at the point yet where
[04:30] Bitcoin is is really being
[04:31] collateralized, like say real estate,
[04:33] but it's on the way. It's on the way. I
[04:35] mean, it has it's it's perfect for
[04:37] collateral. It's it's verifiable. You
[04:39] can see it's there. Um, I mean, you
[04:41] can't sell a a small percentage of a
[04:43] house, you know, to to meet a margin
[04:44] call or or say to buy a cup of coffee,
[04:47] you know, if we're talking currency. Um,
[04:49] so Bitcoin meets those uh
[04:51] characteristics. So, I think it's uh
[04:53] really interesting how we, you know, we
[04:55] all value B bit Bitcoin differently
[04:56] based on where we are and what our needs
[04:58] are. But overall, I would say the the
[05:00] over-encompassing value prop would be
[05:03] savings technology. Long-term savings
[05:04] technology for Bitcoin would be the
[05:07] payment network and industrial value.
[05:10] Good question.
[05:12] Um, it could be it could be it could be.
[05:15] Yeah, I think so. For the for the
[05:17] payment side of things, I do believe
[05:18] that that is downstream of store value.
[05:20] So I believe that medium of exchange and
[05:22] the payment side, the currency side of
[05:24] things will come after store value. Um I
[05:27] think you know Gresham's law would state
[05:29] that good money drives up bad. So if
[05:31] there are gold coins circulating and
[05:33] there's you know non-monetary metal
[05:35] coins circulating, well those gold coins
[05:37] will eventually be pulled from
[05:39] circulation as people figure out they're
[05:40] worth more. Um so I think the same thing
[05:42] with Bitcoin. People are going to
[05:43] eventually want to accept the the harder
[05:45] money, the sound money, the Bitcoin. Um,
[05:48] and they're going to be more inclined to
[05:49] spend the weaker currency out and then
[05:51] over time eventually that will draw that
[05:53] will that will drive out the you know
[05:55] all the good money eventually will be
[05:56] driven out or the bad money rather will
[05:57] be driven out and then we'll be using
[05:58] Bitcoin I I believe. But I think that's
[06:00] a little bit ways down the line. Super
[06:02] interesting. Yeah, it's it's also super
[06:03] interesting. Uh when we talk to
[06:05] different people about Bitcoin, everyone
[06:07] describes it in a in a different sense.
[06:09] The other the the one is like oh it's a
[06:11] spectrum asset. Oh no no it's my savings
[06:13] vehicle. No, I use it as a currency. So
[06:16] like like depends on on who you speak
[06:18] to, what Bitcoin actually is. In the end
[06:21] of the day, h what is Bitcoin for you?
[06:25] Uh so what is Bitcoin for me? That's a
[06:27] great question. Um I would say if I
[06:29] break it down, Bitcoin is money. And if
[06:32] we ask what is money, I think money is
[06:34] time, your human time, energy, and labor
[06:36] tokenized into a market good
[06:38] essentially. And I think if we break it
[06:39] down, that's what Bitcoin is. If we get
[06:41] a little bit more into the weeds,
[06:43] Bitcoin is is uh money. It's the next
[06:45] iteration of money. We've had gold
[06:47] that's performed as as sound commodity
[06:49] money for thousands of years and I
[06:51] believe gold is the digital uh form of
[06:54] that. So it's it's the next iteration in
[06:56] sound money is what I believe. And
[06:58] that's the beautiful thing about Bitcoin
[06:59] like you said is that you can ask 15 20
[07:02] 50 a thousand different you know
[07:04] Bitcoiners that same question and you'll
[07:05] probably get a different answer every
[07:07] time. So that's the be it's all it
[07:09] really is up to interpretation a lot of
[07:11] it. Um and you know like I said value
[07:13] subjective. So it's you may value
[07:16] Bitcoin differently than I do for
[07:17] different reasons. How did you come to
[07:20] to those conclusions? I think just
[07:22] learning the hard way on a lot of
[07:24] things. Um and also learning. I try and
[07:26] learn from other people's mistakes. It's
[07:28] easy to make mistakes and learn from
[07:31] your own mistakes. Maybe not easy, but
[07:33] it's common. But I think it's more
[07:35] effective to learn from other people's
[07:36] mistakes. And I think that's what I I
[07:38] try and do. I try and, you know, and
[07:41] specifically with the whole crypto, you
[07:43] know, the broader crypto scene, like I
[07:45] said, I was more involved in crypto back
[07:46] in uh in the 2017 to 2020 epoch uh or
[07:49] 2016 to 2020 epoch. And I think I
[07:52] learned a lot of hard lessons in that
[07:53] time period. Um and you know, that leads
[07:56] me to another point is that I think it's
[07:58] more difficult to be honest to discuss
[08:00] Bitcoin with coiners than it is
[08:02] with no coiners. So that's what I found
[08:04] in in my experience. I think discussing
[08:06] Bitcoin with no coiners, kind of
[08:08] figuring out where they are and and
[08:09] meeting them where they are. That's the
[08:10] important thing. I think that's more
[08:11] effective than, you know, discussing
[08:13] Bitcoin with with uh with the
[08:15] shitcoiners. I think it's best to kind
[08:17] of just let them, you know, give them
[08:19] the information and let them learn. Let
[08:20] them learn the hard sometimes. You have
[08:22] to learn the hard way. So, yeah, I saw I
[08:25] saw your um I actually have to do that
[08:28] also on my my LinkedIn profile. Your
[08:30] your pronouns are Bitcoin and only. I
[08:34] love that. Thank you. Yeah, got got to
[08:37] be a little creative here and there.
[08:38] There's a lot of great a lot of
[08:40] brilliant minds in the Bitcoin space, so
[08:41] I'm just trying to make a little little
[08:43] tiny mark, you know. But yeah, just like
[08:46] your you know, your podcast and like I
[08:48] said, some of those other podcasts have
[08:49] been really pivotal in in my learning
[08:51] experience and a lot of a lot of other
[08:52] Bitcoiners learning experience. So,
[08:54] thank you for everything you you
[08:56] contribute to the space. Oh, I
[08:58] appreciate that. Yeah, really cool. Um,
[09:00] how do you compare actually because you
[09:02] have a set amount of of money and you
[09:04] can deploy it also in real estate and
[09:06] other assets. How do you compare compare
[09:08] Bitcoin with those? Good question. So, I
[09:11] think bit I look at it like Bitcoin is
[09:13] the opportunity cost. I look at for
[09:16] every purchase Bitcoin is the
[09:17] opportunity cost and this kind of ties
[09:19] into time preference a little bit with
[09:21] how I took this from Safetine Dr. Safety
[09:23] Namoose uh author of the Bitcoin
[09:25] standard right behind me. I really
[09:27] learned this from him in that book
[09:28] actually itself. Um, so I think over
[09:30] time it kind of having Bitcoin, having
[09:33] hard sound money, it lowers your time
[09:35] preference and it really makes you think
[09:37] through your purchases. It really makes
[09:38] you prioritize the future maybe more so
[09:40] than if you're living your life on a
[09:42] fiat standard where your money is
[09:43] devaluing and you're best to deploy it
[09:45] now in, you know, whether you're buying
[09:47] consumer goods or you're buying assets,
[09:49] you're best to deploy it right now
[09:50] because tomorrow you get less for, you
[09:52] know, out of out of that with that same
[09:54] dollar or euro, yen, whatever. Um, with
[09:56] Bitcoin, it's the opposite. you know,
[09:58] it's the most performant asset of the
[09:59] past 16 years, of the past 10 years, of
[10:01] the past 5 years. Yeah, I think it'll be
[10:04] the most performant asset of the next 5,
[10:05] 10, 15 years. Um, so that's kind of how
[10:08] I base it. I if I think that something
[10:10] will outperform Bitcoin, then, you know,
[10:12] I'll invest and take a little bit more
[10:13] risk, but I look at Bitcoin as uh a
[10:16] little bit more d-risked versus some of
[10:17] that stuff, some of those other asset
[10:20] classes. And how I val so I look at risk
[10:23] a little bit differently. I really, you
[10:24] know, Bitcoin's conditioned me to do
[10:26] this, but I look at risk more so through
[10:28] counterparty risk, through the lens of
[10:30] counterparty risk versus, you know,
[10:32] volatility risk or whatever else someone
[10:34] So, we're so comfortable in the West
[10:36] with taking on so much counterparty
[10:38] risk. And I think Bitcoin's kind of
[10:39] shaken that comfort for me, if that
[10:41] makes sense. So, I'm very hesitant to
[10:43] take too much counterparty risk. even
[10:45] when it comes to to you know
[10:46] self-custody solutions and multi-IG and
[10:49] you know collaborative custody it really
[10:52] to me it's all about reducing
[10:54] counterparty risk so that's that's kind
[10:56] of how I uh how I how I judge my
[10:59] investment decisions it's crazy for me
[11:01] that in the traditional financial space
[11:05] volatility is risk like that that has
[11:08] nothing to do for me for with with
[11:11] actual risk um so the the it's it's it's
[11:15] just uh weird for me to see uh how
[11:18] people say like, "Oh, like Bitcoin is so
[11:20] risky." And I'm like like what's what's
[11:21] what's the risk? And they're like,
[11:22] "Yeah, the price goes up and down."
[11:24] Yeah, that's the free market. Like it
[11:25] isn't price discovery. That that's a
[11:27] normal process, but what's the risk? No,
[11:29] that's the risk. That that's not a risk.
[11:32] That has nothing to do uh with actual
[11:35] risk of like, okay, what is the risk of
[11:38] of Bitcoin uh ceasing to exist? What is
[11:41] the risk of you losing your Bitcoin?
[11:43] what is the risk of I don't know Bitcoin
[11:45] breaking down or forking or that th
[11:47] those are things you can talk about but
[11:50] the price going up and down is not a
[11:51] risk that's a that's a feature it's
[11:54] exactly not a bug it's a feature I think
[11:55] you know as Michael Sailor says
[11:57] volatility is vitality so I really take
[11:59] that into my discussions with people you
[12:00] know volatility is the opportunity
[12:02] that's the thing it's it's not if you're
[12:04] going to wait till this thing's fully
[12:05] monetized you missed all that
[12:06] opportunity so the volat the up and down
[12:09] as people don't understand it you know
[12:11] as people are learning Bitcoin
[12:12] understanding the asset that volatility
[12:14] is going to dampen over time. So, I
[12:16] think your best bet is to take advantage
[12:18] of that volatility while you can. It's
[12:19] not going to last forever. You know,
[12:21] eventually bit, you know, maybe to you
[12:23] too, Bitcoin is kind of a boring asset.
[12:24] You know, aside from the volatility,
[12:26] Bitcoin's boring, and I love it that
[12:27] way. It's not too much code. It's it's
[12:30] sluggish. That's what we want. You know,
[12:31] you have to make trade-offs at the base
[12:33] layer, and security is not a trade-off
[12:34] that Satoshi made. Um, so Bitcoin's
[12:37] sluggish. You know, we get a block every
[12:38] 10 minutes. It maintains a hard cap of
[12:40] 21 million. That's why we love Bitcoin
[12:42] because it's simple. It's it's it's
[12:44] really really sluggish. It's hard to
[12:46] push changes through and that's what we
[12:48] want. We don't want a network that is,
[12:49] you know, single node top down changes
[12:51] can be pushed through like that. We want
[12:53] something that's that you can park your
[12:55] capital for 100 years and and not worry,
[12:58] you know, and not worry like you would
[12:59] with, you know, I don't want to call it
[13:01] Ethereum, but say Ethereum, you know,
[13:02] you've seen their monetary policy change
[13:05] 10 15 times in a year. So that's the
[13:07] beauty of Bitcoin. One Bitcoin equals
[13:08] one Bitcoin, you know, regardless of
[13:10] fiat price. So, yeah, you don't want
[13:14] Bitcoin to change all the time. You
[13:15] don't you don't want the the network to
[13:18] have an have an update every second
[13:21] week. Absolutely not. Yeah. Yeah. It's
[13:24] okay to have a sluggish base layer, I
[13:26] think. And I think that scaling wise,
[13:27] we'll scale on on layer 2, you know, we
[13:29] see with lightning and different
[13:31] different layer uh layer 2 applications
[13:33] that we're going to see I think it scale
[13:35] that way to the masses. I mean, you
[13:36] know, the base layer, not everybody's
[13:38] going to be able to have uh, you know,
[13:40] UTXOs and have transactions confirmed.
[13:42] It's just the way the way it's going to
[13:44] be. There's just not enough space, you
[13:46] know. So, and block space is a commodity
[13:48] in its own. I think block space is a
[13:49] separate commodity from from Bitcoin
[13:51] itself, you know. It's not finite like
[13:53] Bitcoin. It's but it is
[13:55] scarce and costly. You said uh till
[13:58] Bitcoin is fully monetized. What do you
[14:01] mean with with fully monetized? So I
[14:04] think um fully monetized I think
[14:06] obtaining its total addressable market
[14:08] is what I would say. I don't think it's
[14:09] going to so we if there's roughly $900
[14:11] trillion in in global assets you know
[14:14] roughly 450 trillion of that is is uh
[14:16] store value assets. So I'm not saying
[14:18] Bitcoin will you know encompass that
[14:21] whole 450 trillion but I think it's
[14:24] going to creep up. I think it's going to
[14:25] keep creeping up. So, I think when I say
[14:27] it's monetizing, I think that that's
[14:29] what I mean. It's going to capture that
[14:31] store value market share essentially.
[14:33] I'm I'm often wondering uh of
[14:36] like because it's not only like it's
[14:39] even beyond store of value. It could
[14:41] also be a currency. Um and then also the
[14:44] store of value side of things. Um I for
[14:47] example don't want to save anything else
[14:50] except of Bitcoin. Maybe if Bitcoin is
[14:53] more matured, uh I want to diversify a
[14:55] little bit in in in high growth stocks
[14:58] like 10% of my portfolios like see some
[15:01] some companies. Maybe I want to own my
[15:03] own uh home. Like that's a that's a
[15:05] thing. But outside of that, uh I I want
[15:09] to be 80 90% in Bitcoin. I don't I don't
[15:11] want to do anything else. And and now
[15:13] I'm wondering is that just because I'm
[15:15] crazy or is that maybe a future model of
[15:19] how people will think about their store
[15:21] of value side? Yeah, I don't think
[15:23] you're crazy for that. I think that's
[15:24] normal. I think we're in a time that's
[15:26] crazy and that is seen as abnormal when
[15:28] I think what you're saying is completely
[15:29] normal. So in in a time period where we
[15:32] have sound money, you're able to work
[15:34] your job, take that risk to go out in
[15:36] the world and provide value to other
[15:37] human beings. You work, you provide your
[15:39] time, energy, and human labor in return
[15:40] for for money, for sound money. You save
[15:43] that sound money, and that's that. You
[15:45] don't have to go home and be a hedge
[15:46] fund manager, be an investor, go
[15:48] research balance sheets and companies
[15:49] and markets and macro. And it's just
[15:51] it's a lot for the average person. You
[15:53] know, somebody should be able to focus
[15:55] on their craft and then come home and
[15:57] spend time with their family and and not
[15:58] take that risk. So, we're in a time
[16:00] period where, you know, I hesitate to
[16:02] call it money. Our currency, it's not
[16:04] money because it doesn't function as
[16:05] money. It doesn't function as a store of
[16:07] value. So, it functions as currency
[16:09] where our money doesn't store value. So,
[16:11] then you have to come home, like I said,
[16:12] and be an investor. You have to go and
[16:14] take abnormal amounts of risk in the
[16:16] markets and and just completely go off
[16:18] the risk curve to to try and keep up
[16:20] with inflation with that with that
[16:22] currency debasement. Um, I think
[16:25] Bitcoin, you know, as sound money, I
[16:27] think it simplifies things. I don't
[16:29] think you're crazy for that. think that
[16:30] it's just the it's just the it makes the
[16:33] most sense that way that you can you can
[16:35] just work, save your money, and then not
[16:37] not go and take, you know, extra risk at
[16:39] home. So, I think that's that's all it
[16:41] is. I think in the future, we're going
[16:42] to see more of that. I think as more
[16:43] people understand Bitcoin, it's just an
[16:45] easier asset. You know, I don't have to
[16:47] I don't have to manage Bitcoin like a
[16:49] like a property, like a real estate
[16:50] property or like, you know, like an like
[16:52] equities in a company. It it's it's just
[16:55] you know you have like I said there's
[16:56] risk in the form of counterparty risk
[16:58] but it really does simplify things I
[17:00] believe. How did Bitcoin how do I say
[17:04] that? What what do you think is the
[17:06] implications of of that when people all
[17:08] of the sudden have that uh store of
[17:10] value side of things again when when
[17:12] people have that uh savings and that
[17:16] good thing again. So I think the
[17:18] implications would be a multitude of
[17:21] things. So one thing would be better
[17:23] relationships, better uh you know family
[17:25] relationships, family and friends. You
[17:27] just get to allocate more time to those.
[17:29] Um another thing to in in in finance
[17:32] terms or in markets would be real
[17:34] estate. Um so that is the most monetized
[17:37] asset class. People it's it's it works.
[17:39] People like to follow what works what's
[17:40] worked historically over the past 40 50
[17:43] years. Real estate has been the the
[17:44] premier store value asset. it people
[17:46] love to to buy rental properties and
[17:48] even if you don't rent them out, you
[17:50] hold them, you know, that property is
[17:51] going to keep up with inflation. So, I
[17:52] think with with what Bitcoin really
[17:55] impacts is it allows people to save
[17:58] money that is not money inside of real
[18:00] estate. So, basically, it's it's that
[18:02] cost of living and that cost that
[18:04] average home cost won't won't keep, you
[18:06] know, ripping up. I think it'll it'll be
[18:08] more of a a stagnant steady, you know,
[18:10] home home value increase versus, you
[18:12] know, because people aren't going out
[18:13] and taking plus when people go take out
[18:16] leverage for real estate, that's new
[18:17] money creation. That's that's a way that
[18:19] um you know, fiat is created. So that's
[18:21] not that's not depositor depositors
[18:24] deposits that you're borrowing to then
[18:25] buy real estate. That's new money that's
[18:27] been created to buy that that uh house
[18:29] or that property.
[18:30] Yeah, that that's a big big thing that
[18:32] people don't get that how how money is
[18:34] actually created with with with depth.
[18:36] That's it's it's so fundamental. How did
[18:38] Bitcoin actually uh impact you? Oh man,
[18:42] I don't even know where to where to
[18:43] begin on that. Um I could start with
[18:45] health. I mean, health is a good start
[18:46] with that. Um I'd say it made me, like I
[18:49] said, it it lowered my time preference
[18:50] and made me really prioritize the
[18:52] future. And when you do that, you you
[18:54] look back in the mirror at yourself and
[18:56] you, you know, look at your body and
[18:58] your weight and what you're eating and
[18:59] your habits. And I think it just overall
[19:01] on a personal level, uh, really helped
[19:04] kind of get me, you know, to to improve
[19:07] my habits, you know, decrease bad habits
[19:08] and and increase good habits. Um, when
[19:12] it comes to purchases, I think it's made
[19:14] me prioritize, like I said, the future,
[19:16] lowered my time preference. So, I don't
[19:18] just think about consumption right now.
[19:20] I think about, okay, the opportunity
[19:22] cost of this Bitcoin in the future, if I
[19:24] save this money now, well, in the
[19:26] future, I'll have more purchasing power.
[19:28] So, I think that's that's a big way, you
[19:29] know, I it allows me to weigh my
[19:31] purchases completely different than
[19:33] before. Um, and I was always a saver. It
[19:35] wasn't like I was a big consumer, but I
[19:37] think it's just for, you know, there are
[19:39] a lot of people that are savers out
[19:40] there, but we're not in a climate that
[19:41] you can save. So, Bitcoin just re
[19:44] revamps that, I think, revitalizes that.
[19:46] it, you know, it's it's the perfect
[19:48] thing for savers because savers can save
[19:50] again. They don't have to be an
[19:51] investor. If you are a great saver,
[19:53] that's great, but you might not be a
[19:55] great investor either. So, saving, you
[19:58] know, having Bitcoin will allow the
[19:59] savers to save again is is what I say.
[20:02] So, um, and to, you know, to touch back
[20:05] on that previous question, I'll tie it
[20:06] into this. So, I look at anything on top
[20:09] of Bitcoin as
[20:10] as extra risk, basically. So, Bitcoin is
[20:13] the opportunity cost. Anything you do on
[20:14] top of that is risk. So Micro Strategy
[20:16] for example, if you want to add a
[20:18] percentage of, you know, Micro Strategy
[20:19] allocation to your portfolio, well, you
[20:21] have Bitcoin as your money and then
[20:22] Micro Strategy is a bit more risk. You
[20:25] know, it's it's levered up and it's it's
[20:27] got more counterparty risk than having
[20:29] Bitcoin in multiig or or in, you know,
[20:31] um single sig self-custody. So that's
[20:33] kind of how I um how I look at it, I
[20:37] would say. Um yeah, I think that's how
[20:39] that's that's it. How do you look at
[20:42] micro strategy? Oh, strategy B now.
[20:45] Yeah, that's going to keep getting me
[20:47] the uh the name change there. So,
[20:48] strategy, yeah, I think what they've
[20:50] done is incredible. It's seriously set
[20:52] the set the standard I think for um
[20:55] Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. I
[20:57] think that we're going to see I think we
[20:59] expected to see more companies follow
[21:00] suit last cycle. Um but I think some of
[21:03] the accounting rules and rags were not
[21:05] in favor of that. I think now uh with
[21:08] the repeal of SAB 121 it might be a
[21:10] little bit more favorable. So we might
[21:11] you know start seeing some more
[21:13] companies and now we're seeing it you
[21:14] know at the nation state level start to
[21:15] pick up. So I think everything
[21:17] strategies done is is very impressive
[21:19] for the space and I think you know
[21:22] Michael Sailor um he really humbled
[21:24] himself I think and Bitcoin humbles
[21:26] everybody. Um, I think
[21:29] he you you don't expect to understand
[21:32] Bitcoin and to want to add it to your
[21:34] tra your your balance sheet, but he went
[21:36] through the he went through all the
[21:37] assets that he can add to his to his
[21:39] balance sheet and Bitcoin was the one.
[21:40] It was the best for for good reason. And
[21:42] he put the time in and did the proof of
[21:43] work. And I think that's, you know,
[21:45] that's all I have to say about strategy.
[21:46] I think what they did is is phenomenal.
[21:47] And what they're doing for Bitcoin
[21:49] education is is great. It's super
[21:51] interesting when we when you look at
[21:53] strategy. Do you it's kind of um but
[21:57] when we look at my strategy B and what
[21:59] they are doing with with Bitcoin and you
[22:02] look how successful they have been uh it
[22:06] kind of makes you wonder why there's no
[22:07] one following and then you see oh there
[22:09] are some actually following like
[22:10] Metabanet and and other companies that
[22:12] that are following suit um but not in a
[22:15] real mass way. is like you you you can
[22:19] you can I think there's like 83 publicly
[22:22] traded companies that that have Bitcoin
[22:24] on the balance sheet. Um maybe first
[22:26] thing what do you think is other
[22:29] companies still holding them back? Uh
[22:32] and and what do you kind of expect for
[22:34] for future uh bitcoin adoption on
[22:37] treasury side?
[22:39] So I think the biggest thing holding
[22:40] most companies back is the ownership
[22:42] structure. So yeah, like you said, there
[22:45] are 80 80 odd publicly traded companies
[22:47] that have Bitcoin on their balance
[22:48] sheet. We can't even count how many
[22:50] private, you know, family-owned, small
[22:52] family-owned and operated businesses
[22:53] that, you know, incorporate Bitcoin into
[22:55] their business, whether that be on a
[22:56] payment side or on a balance sheet side.
[22:58] I'm guessing more so on the balance
[22:59] sheet side. with the public companies. I
[23:01] think the ownership structure of Micro
[23:03] Strategy and the ability that Michael
[23:06] Sailor had to kind of push things
[23:07] through the company and and also his
[23:09] convincing nature, you know, his
[23:10] educated um intelligent and convincing
[23:12] nature allowed him to kind of ed maybe
[23:14] educate his board or um his staff on on
[23:17] on this change. I don't think a lot of
[23:19] companies have that. And we saw with
[23:20] Microsoft, for example, you know, it
[23:22] came to a vote, I want to say, was that
[23:24] late last year? Uh Q4 last year came to
[23:27] a vote that was turned down. Um, I think
[23:30] eventually it'll go through, but with a
[23:32] company like that, like an Apple, you
[23:33] know, fang, a fang company, Facebook,
[23:35] Amazon, I think it's just hard to push
[23:37] something like a change like this
[23:38] through. It just takes time. I think
[23:41] strategy was just perfectly set up for
[23:43] something like this. You need a a
[23:45] special kind of a company. Um, maybe
[23:48] even like a a Facebook where there not
[23:51] Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg still in in
[23:53] control or like a Tesla. They already
[23:55] did it, but they they could be more
[23:56] aggressive. Uh so like you need a
[23:59] special kind of company with the
[24:00] ownership structure to actually go ahead
[24:02] and and purchase Bitcoin. H and and
[24:05] there's also the career risk of it. Um I
[24:08] think a lot of CFOs even though they
[24:10] might like uh in in private Bitcoin they
[24:14] think like okay what if I suggest that
[24:18] to the board and if I say we will do
[24:21] that do do I might just get on the bad
[24:25] side of it if if I now choose a bad
[24:27] timing and it goes in a bare market and
[24:29] it's down for like one two years uh and
[24:32] and maybe I I risk my job. So I think
[24:34] there's this human um career risk thing
[24:39] going on also which is which is an
[24:41] interesting
[24:43] um interesting effect which could
[24:46] actually flip at some point where a CFO
[24:49] that maybe even is not a big fan of
[24:53] Bitcoin but he sees that all the other
[24:55] companies are doing it uh and it goes to
[24:58] the point where the career risk actually
[25:00] flips over to oh I have to have a
[25:03] Bitcoin strate strategy if the CEO comes
[25:05] like oh what are we doing with Bitcoin
[25:07] the CFO has to have an answer so that
[25:10] that career risk uh and the flipping of
[25:12] the career risk is is really interesting
[25:14] to see but I do think we are some time
[25:18] away from from from that happening
[25:21] absolutely I do think the Overton window
[25:23] is shifting I think like you said the
[25:25] career risk is flipping I think it's
[25:27] it's I think it's going to eventually be
[25:29] the opposite I think if you're not doing
[25:31] this stuff then if you're not you
[25:33] putting Bitcoin on your balance sheet or
[25:34] talking about it or or really putting
[25:36] the time or the proof of work to
[25:37] understanding it, then it's going to
[25:39] look bad, you know, in the future. I
[25:40] don't think your your clients, if you're
[25:42] a financial adviser, are going to
[25:43] appreciate if you're, you know, telling
[25:45] them to not look at this thing when you
[25:47] haven't even put the time in. So, I do I
[25:49] do see that. I think a lot of
[25:50] Bitcoiners, you know, we're so in the
[25:52] moment or people in general are in the
[25:53] moment. You expect it to happen right
[25:55] now, but, you know, we're only 16 plus
[25:57] years into this thing. You know, another
[25:59] who knows what can happen in another 16
[26:01] years. So things really do move pretty
[26:03] quickly. So I think we need to just be
[26:05] patient and kind of let this thing
[26:06] monetize and and really just be there to
[26:08] to help people understand it and be
[26:10] there to educate because because really
[26:12] it Bitcoin is only as good as the humans
[26:14] behind it. It's not it's not exactly
[26:16] like gold where it was it was it was in
[26:17] the earth and we discovered it and dug
[26:19] it up. Although I do believe we
[26:20] discovered Bitcoin, humans engineered
[26:22] Bitcoin with an with an understanding of
[26:24] thousands of years of monetary history.
[26:26] Um, so at the end of the day, it is a
[26:28] human engineered protocol that is only
[26:30] as good as the humans that back support
[26:32] and and you know are behind it
[26:35] essentially. How important are the
[26:37] educators in in Bitcoin and and those
[26:40] who who I mean that's a self-serving
[26:42] question now for me but
[26:45] uh what do you think is the role of of
[26:48] people that are orange pilling and maybe
[26:50] not even not even going to to the extent
[26:53] of people that are having podcast or
[26:55] anything like that just just people that
[26:57] that uh orange pill their neighborhood
[27:00] orange pill their family I think it's an
[27:03] important role I think it is I don't
[27:04] think I at least I don't like to be the
[27:06] person that's super, you know, if I
[27:07] talked to you in person, you wouldn't
[27:09] even know that I'm that I'm, you know,
[27:11] into Bitcoin or interested in it or or
[27:12] whatever unless you bring it up if
[27:14] you're Yeah, exactly. I don't really
[27:16] wear this out. I don't wear this stuff
[27:17] out too much, but yes, exactly. Um, so
[27:19] you wouldn't know. Um, unless unless you
[27:21] bring it up or unless you're a close
[27:23] friend and you know, we talk about it. I
[27:24] try and not be super in-your-face about
[27:26] it. Uh, it just doesn't really work too
[27:28] well. I think you need to meet people
[27:30] where they are and let them come to you.
[27:32] Um, with that being said, I do think
[27:34] Bitcoin educators are very important. I
[27:35] think this is is a tough thing to
[27:37] understand if you don't really have a
[27:39] passion for it. If you don't want to sit
[27:41] down or a need, I should say. You know,
[27:44] um, having a need for Bitcoin does push
[27:46] people into Bitcoin. That's just how,
[27:48] you know, money works over time. Having
[27:49] a need for better money will push you
[27:51] into that better form of of hard harder
[27:53] sound money. Um, so I yeah, I do think
[27:56] it's important to have people in in the
[27:58] community that you can fall back on if
[27:59] you have questions, especially when it
[28:00] comes to Bitcoin security. You really
[28:02] want to make sure that you're
[28:03] prioritizing your your security setup
[28:05] and you're not messing up on that. You
[28:07] want to spend time and focus and um and
[28:09] make sure that's hunkered down. Let's
[28:11] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[28:13] the beauty that Coin Vigilante has made
[28:17] with the Bitcoin watches. Those watches
[28:19] are the most amazing, the most eleigent
[28:22] way of showing that you are a true
[28:25] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[28:28] dropped a completely new and amazing
[28:30] Genesis edition of their watch
[28:33] collections. You have the date of the
[28:35] first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[28:38] there. And of course, also the block
[28:40] height and which epoch we are currently
[28:43] in. I love the level of detail they put
[28:46] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[28:49] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[28:52] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[28:54] love those watches so so much. And now,
[28:57] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[29:00] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[29:02] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[29:04] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[29:06] first way is you put it on a hardware
[29:08] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[29:11] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[29:14] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[29:17] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[29:20] if you check out the link in the
[29:22] description, you even get 5% off if you
[29:25] use the code Robin. And the second way
[29:27] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[29:31] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[29:34] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[29:37] They will personalize for you a
[29:39] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[29:42] your individual situation. They will
[29:45] show you how you can secure your own
[29:47] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[29:49] enough. You also have to keep all your
[29:51] devices secure. One topic that is
[29:54] overlooked often is the inheritance
[29:56] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[29:59] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[30:02] a plan for that in place already? And
[30:04] last but not least, if you're in a
[30:06] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[30:08] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[30:11] that, head over to the
[30:15] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[30:17] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[30:20] will be for the first time ever speaking
[30:23] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[30:26] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[30:28] really looking forward to seeing all of
[30:30] you there. You can get your ticket in
[30:33] the link down in the description of
[30:35] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[30:37] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[30:41] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[30:43] there. You you said security and not
[30:45] self custody. Do do you is there do you
[30:49] see more to self custody uh more to
[30:52] security than just self custody? Um I do
[30:55] I do think there's more to it. I was
[30:57] talking Yeah. generally versus Yes.
[30:59] self-custody versus keep, you know,
[31:01] keeping it in hot wallets, for example.
[31:02] A lot of people no coiners that come in
[31:04] with small balances. It's it's okay to
[31:05] keep in, you know, in a hot wallet for a
[31:07] little bit. But over time, as you start
[31:08] saving and as that balance, that cash
[31:10] balance grows and you have more
[31:11] purchasing power, it's best to, you
[31:13] know, move, like you said, move it into
[31:14] self-custody. But when it comes to
[31:16] self-custody, yes, there are better
[31:18] forms like, for example, multisig. You
[31:20] could do a geographically distributed
[31:21] multi-IG setup where you know even if
[31:23] somebody did have access to you or your
[31:26] keys, they can't do anything unless they
[31:28] hop on a plane with you or or hop in a
[31:30] train or on a car or what or in a car,
[31:31] whatever and and go to wherever that
[31:33] other set of seed phrases are. Um
[31:36] because so for example, a two of three
[31:38] multi setup, you would need two of those
[31:40] uh seed phrases to then sign for a
[31:42] transaction for that bitcoin to be moved
[31:45] versus having one seed with you know one
[31:47] person on that site for example. Yeah.
[31:49] And and I and I like that you you threw
[31:52] it in there with a hot wallet because I
[31:53] I'm I'm actually a big fan of using like
[31:56] a blue wallet or uh and like some sort
[31:59] of hot wallet that uh is backed up to
[32:02] some metal plate or something like that
[32:04] as just as a paying thing of a I mean
[32:08] maybe I'm in a special place because I
[32:10] receive Bitcoin payments and I send
[32:12] Bitcoin payments with my business, but
[32:15] uh without like that's very essential
[32:17] for me. There's never a lot of money on
[32:19] there. Um, but uh it's it's great to
[32:23] have self custody on your phone. Uh, it
[32:26] can be backed up to the the to metal
[32:28] plate. Uh, if the phone dies all of the
[32:32] sudden, um, you you don't have to worry
[32:34] about security that much there because
[32:37] it's just um like there's only a certain
[32:39] amount there. If if I lose that, it's
[32:41] okay with me. Um uh and then it's like
[32:44] the savings account, the the savings
[32:48] vehicle of of Bitcoin that has to be
[32:51] super secure multisig and and all those
[32:54] things uh uh that you can do. But I do
[32:57] like the idea and I think it's
[32:59] underappreciated especially as like a um
[33:03] a medium wallet especially if you do
[33:06] payments uh having a hot wallet just on
[33:08] your phone that's accessible uh and and
[33:11] where you can send and receive quickly
[33:13] Bitcoin. Absolutely. I would agree. I
[33:16] think it's no different than having a
[33:17] wallet in your pocket. You know, you
[33:18] don't keep your life savings in your
[33:20] pocket. You know, you keep a couple
[33:22] hundred bucks or whatever you need to to
[33:23] get by the day or the week and that's
[33:25] it. if it if it's lost um you know that
[33:28] sucks but it's gone is what it is you
[33:29] know so I think that's how you should
[33:31] look at it that's how that's how I
[33:32] recommend to to you know people that
[33:34] come to me that's how I would recommend
[33:36] it keep a little bit in a hot wallet in
[33:37] case you you do want to spend bitcoin
[33:38] but you know save and keep that in a
[33:40] really secure multi-IG or single sig
[33:42] self-custody solution absolutely and how
[33:45] do you look at the current developments
[33:47] actually um uh we there's so much going
[33:50] on there it's a second year of the ETF
[33:52] the SA s how do you say it sap uh 121 is
[33:57] is uh was lifted I think two months ago
[34:01] already. Uh we have the strategic bit
[34:03] Bitcoin reserve. So it's crazy what's
[34:05] going on today. Yeah, it's been a crazy
[34:08] past you know year and a half um ever
[34:11] since January of last year was when the
[34:13] ETFs were approved. It's been pretty
[34:15] pretty incredible. And then we had the
[34:16] having of course in April um of last
[34:19] year. So yeah, the ETFs really set this
[34:21] thing off. I think I mean, you know,
[34:23] Bitcoin it did very well before the
[34:25] ETFs, but a lot of Bitcoiners think, you
[34:27] know, they want Wall Street out. They
[34:29] don't want banks involved. They don't
[34:30] want governments involved, but I don't
[34:31] think that's that's possible. I think
[34:33] it's inevitable that the that the
[34:34] Bitcoin is for for anyone essentially is
[34:37] what I'm trying to say. So, I think it's
[34:38] inevitable that we would see these
[34:40] individuals and institutions start
[34:41] getting involved and interested in
[34:43] Bitcoin. I think the ETFs really set
[34:46] things off for the, you know,
[34:48] institutional adoption. And as you as
[34:50] you know, it's the most successful ETF
[34:52] launch of all time, the the Bitcoin is
[34:55] specifically IBIT, Black Rockck spot
[34:56] Bitcoin ETF. So, I think yeah, it's been
[34:59] a a crazy past year. Um, I think it's
[35:02] only going to get crazier and I think,
[35:04] you know, a lot of people expect the
[35:06] having, for example, or the ETF
[35:07] approvals to be a quick, you know,
[35:10] instant price jump event. But I think
[35:12] they're really long duration supply
[35:14] events is what I'm seeing. supply demand
[35:16] events. We're seeing, you know, long
[35:18] periods of time o over long course of
[35:19] time the ETFs continuing to stack
[35:21] Bitcoin and adopt Bitcoin. And same with
[35:23] the having, you know, it's a it's a it's
[35:25] a long-term effect. You don't see you
[35:26] don't see that supply effect instantly.
[35:28] It it's it's over time as that, you
[35:30] know, the issuance gets hald over time
[35:33] then you start to see it as demand stays
[35:35] stagnant or increases, you see the
[35:36] effects. So, it's not going to be an
[35:38] overnight thing. We're we're, you know,
[35:40] we're seeing delayed effects like many
[35:42] of us predicted and thought would
[35:43] happen. So, it's interesting. Uh I just
[35:45] talked in the the previous episode
[35:48] uh with Danny from from Coin Corner uh
[35:51] and we discussed how retail is is not
[35:55] there in the in this bull cycle. So if
[35:57] you look at the bull cycle of of this
[35:59] time uh we see the price rising to over
[36:02] 100k actually but um the retails are not
[36:07] there. You can see it in SD on exchange.
[36:11] You can see it in the buy volume uh in
[36:12] in the new user registrations and stuff
[36:14] like that. But you can also look at
[36:16] Google Trends and and see like the word
[36:19] buy Bitcoin uh and it's only 9% of what
[36:24] it was uh 2017 and the price today is
[36:29] actually um uh three or four times or
[36:33] maybe even five times as as high as it
[36:35] was 2017. So, the people that are in
[36:39] this bull run uh are way more convicted
[36:42] and putting more of their money in
[36:43] Bitcoin. And the people that are in
[36:46] Bitcoin right now have deeper pockets
[36:48] than in 2017. Uh which is super
[36:51] interesting to see and makes you wonder
[36:53] if there's still in retail runup to
[36:56] come.
[36:58] Yeah, I think retail I think retail's
[37:00] pretty exhausted in this cycle. And like
[37:03] I touched on earlier with with some of
[37:05] my, you know, crypto acquaintances and
[37:06] friends, I think a lot of them see
[37:08] Bitcoin, just from personal experience
[37:10] talking to them as something that's not,
[37:12] you know, they're looking for a
[37:13] get-richqu. They're looking for a like a
[37:15] gambling type, you know, hit on red type
[37:18] thing. That's not what Bitcoin is going
[37:19] to provide them. Bitcoin's a it's not a
[37:21] get-rich quick scheme. It's a don't get
[37:23] poor slow scheme. You know, it's not
[37:25] gonna it's not gonna you're not going to
[37:26] get rich quick with Bitcoin. I'm not
[37:28] you're not you might not even get rich
[37:29] with Bitcoin. what you're going to do is
[37:30] you're going to store your earnings over
[37:32] time and space unlike with pretty much
[37:34] anything else. Um, in the most efficient
[37:36] manner that is. Um, so yeah, I think
[37:39] retail I think retail's pretty exhausted
[37:41] this cycle. I think a lot of them are,
[37:43] you know, a lot a lot of the retail
[37:45] markets further out on the risk curve.
[37:46] They're playing with crypto or they just
[37:48] maybe aren't interested quite yet in
[37:50] Bitcoin. They're waiting to see 250,
[37:51] 500, whatever fiat value they they want
[37:54] to see. I think this is the
[37:56] institutional and nation state phase of
[37:57] Bitcoin. I do. I think retail, you know,
[37:59] Bitcoin's the first asset where retail
[38:02] had a 16-year jump on everyone else. You
[38:04] know, there was no premine, no, you
[38:06] know, pre-investor offerings or
[38:08] whatever. So, Bitcoin was the first true
[38:10] asset that the retail market had the
[38:12] advantage over Wall Street because Wall
[38:14] Street, you know, had to wait. The
[38:16] governments have to wait basically, you
[38:17] know. Um, so I I think this is a
[38:20] slightly different thing than we've ever
[38:22] seen before in that in that context. I I
[38:24] don't know what retail's interest is
[38:26] going to be like. I do think it's going
[38:27] to pick up when when we get deep into
[38:29] the six figures. But yeah, like you said
[38:31] with Google search trends, that's a good
[38:33] metric to look at. You know, it's it's
[38:34] low. It's low comparatively speaking.
[38:37] So,
[38:38] how essential is the the price
[38:40] movements? I I made the argument that
[38:42] even at a million, we probably won't
[38:44] have more than 10% of of retail in
[38:46] Bitcoin.
[38:48] Could be. Yeah, it could be. Yeah. And
[38:50] and retail is not price agnostic like
[38:52] say institutions are or nation states.
[38:54] So, they don't care. they they'll
[38:55] they'll they'll buy Bitcoin if it's
[38:57] 500,000 or 5 million. They're and
[38:58] they're waiting to see those higher
[39:00] numbers. Whereas retail, you know, I I
[39:02] just don't think retail grasps, you
[39:04] know, what this this asset is. I think
[39:06] retail conflates Bitcoin and crypto and
[39:09] looks at it kind of as one. And I think
[39:11] over time that's changing. I think
[39:13] you're seeing people starting to
[39:15] differentiate Bitcoin and crypto and
[39:17] that's good. That's a really good thing.
[39:18] Um I think over time as people learn the
[39:20] hard way that'll just be more
[39:22] commonplace. I think people, you know,
[39:24] you get burnt on the stove, you're not
[39:26] going to touch it again. You're going to
[39:27] go, you're going to cower back to the
[39:28] safe Bitcoin. So, I look at Bitcoin,
[39:31] it's the uh it's the the risk, it's the
[39:33] the most conservative thing in the
[39:35] riskiest sector, the riskiest industry.
[39:38] It's the most conservative asset and the
[39:39] riskiest portion. So, that's kind of how
[39:40] I like to to base it off of. How do you
[39:42] think then? Uh and it's a really good
[39:44] thing of like it's it's
[39:47] the it's it's the riskiest space but uh
[39:50] just because of all the other
[39:52] cryptos. Uh so so so but but maybe the
[39:56] volatility if you if you say risk is
[39:59] volatility then then it makes more sense
[40:02] right to the retail to the retail person
[40:04] not to us because like I said we look at
[40:06] we might look at you know risk
[40:07] differently. I don't see Bitcoin's
[40:08] volatility like we said earlier as risk
[40:10] at all. It's opportunity. So,
[40:13] absolutely. How do you how do you think
[40:16] adoption will grow over time? Uh how how
[40:20] do we get to everyone getting into
[40:23] Bitcoin? What will be the the trigger
[40:25] points that that actually get masses
[40:27] into Bitcoin? I think once
[40:30] people can witness and feel the true
[40:33] effects of a finite asset is when
[40:35] they'll start to kind of move their
[40:37] purchasing power over to Bitcoin. And I
[40:38] don't think it's going to be an
[40:39] overnight thing. I know gradually then
[40:41] suddenly we we might see more of an
[40:43] S-curve, you know, adoption um and we
[40:46] may get to that more parabolic phase,
[40:48] but I think it's going to be a more
[40:49] gradual thing. It's going to be um okay,
[40:51] so we allocate 5% of our portfolio to
[40:53] Bitcoin. Okay, and that 5% starts to,
[40:55] you know, churn and get a little bit
[40:57] higher and click up a little bit. All
[40:58] right, well let's look at this thing.
[40:59] Either you can rebalance and sell off or
[41:01] you can maybe add a little bit more
[41:02] because it's outperforming everything
[41:04] else. So, I think over time, Bitcoin is
[41:06] just going to encapsulate your entire
[41:09] portfolio, whether you like it or not.
[41:10] You start with a 5% portfolio or
[41:12] allocation, and you don't touch it. Like
[41:14] I said, that'll just increase and
[41:15] increase and increase. So, I think
[41:17] that's sort of how we get there. I think
[41:20] back to Gresham's law, good money drives
[41:21] out bad, I think, or I'm sorry, bad
[41:23] money drives out good. I think that's
[41:25] what we're going to see. people are
[41:26] going to want to then save the Bitcoin
[41:28] which then you know if you're using
[41:29] Bitcoin as a store of value without
[41:31] knowing it you're essentially using it
[41:33] as a medium of exchange because Bitcoin
[41:36] is money. Money is not designed for the
[41:38] purpose of consumption. It's designed
[41:39] for the purpose of holding on to for you
[41:42] know consum for buying something at a
[41:44] later date. So with what you're doing is
[41:46] you're still using it as a medium of
[41:48] exchange if you're using it as a store
[41:49] of value assuming that you're going to
[41:51] eventually spend it which most people
[41:52] will. It's it's money. Um, so I think
[41:55] that at the end of it, at the end of
[41:57] that store value phase, someone's going
[41:58] to be using it as a medium of exchange.
[42:00] So it's going to be traded. It's going
[42:01] to be, you know, it's going to go back
[42:03] and forth just like money. I think
[42:06] yeah, it's that game theory of uh f
[42:09] first you buy it because uh you really
[42:12] want to gamble in it and you really want
[42:13] to just like like the price club, then
[42:15] you're like, "Oh, like that's really
[42:16] cool. I can hold it also." And then uh
[42:19] you you actually research it. And the
[42:22] more you research, you're like, "Oh,
[42:23] that actually makes sense." And then it
[42:25] kind of consumes more and more of your
[42:28] portfolio. And then all of the sudden,
[42:29] you're 100% in. Uh, and uh, then maybe
[42:33] you you start uh, spending a little bit.
[42:36] And then that's how the circular
[42:37] economies get started where people all
[42:40] of the sudden earn Bitcoin and spend
[42:42] Bitcoin and save in Bitcoin. And this
[42:44] this whole thing is is really a nice
[42:46] circle economy across across the globe.
[42:49] It just takes probably longer than
[42:52] people assume. Absolutely. And and like
[42:54] you said, as that percentage increases
[42:56] in your portfolio, people get more
[42:58] interested and they want to go learn.
[42:59] It's like, okay, why is this thing doing
[43:01] this? Why is this outperforming
[43:02] everything, you know, and it makes you
[43:04] want to look into it and read books like
[43:06] the Bitcoin standard by safety. And so I
[43:08] think we're just going to see more and
[43:09] more of that. More people are
[43:11] understanding Bitcoin every day than
[43:12] not, you know, every 10 minutes, every
[43:14] time, every every block confirmation,
[43:16] there's there more staying power. the
[43:18] Lindy effect is building and growing for
[43:20] Bitcoin versus the opposite. So, I think
[43:22] we're we're at a very pivotal exciting
[43:24] moment in time where we get to witness a
[43:27] mon the monetization of a brand new
[43:29] asset, digital gold, whatever you want
[43:31] to call it, you know, new money, digital
[43:34] money. Um, and I think it's a very
[43:35] fascinating thing to witness.
[43:38] Yeah. It's also the the game theory of
[43:40] it. Uh, and and witnessing the USA and
[43:43] and and Europe, you're in you're in
[43:45] America, if I right? Yes. Yep.
[43:48] How is it for you to live in a country
[43:50] where all of a sudden the politicians
[43:52] and the presidents are slowly catching
[43:54] up to Bitcoin? Yeah, it's interesting. I
[43:58] think we we saw a major flip. Uh so the
[44:00] last administration was staunchly anti-
[44:03] crypto, you know, anti- Bitcoin, but
[44:06] there's not much you can do to stop
[44:07] Bitcoin. Um so the SEC kind of had to
[44:10] allow it in. I think that that So
[44:13] there's gives and takes. There's
[44:14] benefits to to both. I think that in the
[44:17] last administration, the benefit to that
[44:19] was that that kept out a lot of the
[44:21] scams. So, Bitcoin being the only true
[44:24] digital decentralized secure commodity
[44:27] out there, you know, was allowed to kind
[44:29] of we eventually got the ETF through.
[44:31] Um, but it kept out a lot of the scams,
[44:33] a lot of the cryptos, the rugps, the
[44:34] shitcoins. What we're seeing now is a a
[44:37] much more friendly digital asset
[44:40] administration, but that's allowing some
[44:42] of the scams in a lot of the meme coins
[44:44] that are that are coming in. rugps. So,
[44:46] I think it's a give and take. I think o,
[44:48] you know, the long term it's it's a good
[44:49] thing that we're seeing. It's just in
[44:51] due time game theory would state that
[44:53] politicians will eventually flip on it.
[44:56] But, like I said, it's a give and take.
[44:58] So, with that comes some of the
[45:00] shitcoinery and the gambling and and the
[45:02] scams that we really don't like. It's
[45:04] also interesting when we think about
[45:07] the implications of a bull run and we
[45:10] had 2017 the ICO, we had 2021 the NFTTS
[45:15] and that's also another indication for
[45:16] me that that we currently don't have a
[45:19] real bull run because there's there's no
[45:22] real
[45:23] distraction next to the Bitcoin. It it's
[45:26] it's just Bitcoin and and uh NFTTS are
[45:30] that flat. uh the the crypto economy
[45:33] is not that exciting. I I don't hear
[45:36] anything. I mean, there's Ripple guys
[45:38] that sometimes are a little bit annoying
[45:39] in the comment section, but uh it's
[45:42] okay. They they don't really bother me
[45:44] at all. Uh so, it's it's it's really
[45:47] calm. It's almost like a bare market.
[45:50] Yeah, it's not it's definitely not the
[45:51] same as as the last cycle perhaps. Um, I
[45:54] I do still have some Ripple salespeople
[45:56] and some chain link salespeople that are
[45:58] uh in my in my I'll call them sales
[46:00] people because it's essentially what
[46:01] they are. So, they're, you know,
[46:02] shilling these coins and and trying to
[46:04] convince even myself about them. So,
[46:07] it's I mean, it's it's normal, but I
[46:08] think that it's dampening. I think it's
[46:10] dampening for sure and and the, you
[46:12] know, the price charts don't help them.
[46:14] It doesn't help their case when when
[46:16] their their asset of choice is is dying
[46:18] against Bitcoin, um, to put it lightly.
[46:20] So, yeah, I'm I'm not saying it's not
[46:22] going to happen again. We're not going
[46:23] to see another epoch of this gambling
[46:26] that's going on. We're still going to
[46:27] most likely see it, but I just think
[46:29] over time, you know, there's there's
[46:31] currently there's more crypto tokens
[46:33] than there are total Bitcoin. So, I
[46:36] think that's a pretty and by by over
[46:37] double. So, there's there's it's it's a
[46:39] crazy crazy, you know, difference
[46:41] between these things between Bitcoin and
[46:43] crypto. And yeah, I I think like I said,
[46:46] I think we're still going to see it, but
[46:47] I think it's going to be a dwindling
[46:49] effect over time. I just think as they
[46:51] they they don't have the staying power
[46:52] that Bitcoin has. They're they they they
[46:54] don't make they didn't make the
[46:55] necessary trade-offs on on the base
[46:57] layer. They didn't have an immaculate
[46:58] conception. They're not truly
[46:59] decentralized and secure. They don't
[47:01] have the highest wall of hash rate
[47:02] defending the network. So, you know,
[47:04] there's a multitude of reasons that
[47:06] these things won't last. And, you know,
[47:08] I try and just focus on sound money. So,
[47:10] I, you know, I'm sure there's different
[47:12] use cases for tokenization and NFTts and
[47:14] this and that. I just don't focus on it.
[47:16] There's not enough time in the day. you
[47:18] know, I I I work a job that's not in
[47:20] Bitcoin. I run a a side business that's
[47:21] not in Bitcoin. So, I'm very busy
[47:23] outside of the Bitcoin space. This is
[47:25] still sort of a passion project for me.
[47:27] I'd like to work in the space
[47:28] eventually, but I just don't have the
[47:30] time to investigate and study and and do
[47:32] all this research for these projects.
[47:34] I'm interested in sound money and that's
[47:36] it. And Bitcoin is the best sound money
[47:38] that humans have. Why would you like to
[47:39] work in in in Bitcoin? I'm I'm asking
[47:42] that because maybe I'll give a little
[47:44] bit background because I'm asking that I
[47:46] see Bitcoiners go through that journey
[47:48] of like oh like let's scam in Bitcoin.
[47:51] Okay, let's adopt Bitcoin uh in in my
[47:54] portfolio. Okay, let's go all in Bitcoin
[47:57] and then like oh I also want to work in
[47:59] Bitcoin. So they they kind of transfer
[48:01] everything like the financial and their
[48:04] their life energy to Bitcoin as I did
[48:06] myself. And I'm
[48:08] wondering why why that is. We we don't
[48:11] do that with Tesla. Like there are
[48:14] people we don't do with that with
[48:15] stocks. We're like, "Oh, like let's get
[48:17] that into the stock. Oh, let's go all in
[48:18] in that stock. Oh, let's let's work at
[48:20] that company."
[48:23] Yeah, it's a great great point. Yeah, I
[48:25] think it's just it's just the feeling of
[48:27] you want to do more. You want to
[48:28] contribute more to the space. I think,
[48:30] you know, you can contribute a lot from
[48:32] a more outside perspective if you're
[48:33] just doing some Bitcoin education,
[48:34] talking about it, saving in Bitcoin, but
[48:37] I think some people like myself and like
[48:39] you, you want to go a step above. You
[48:40] want to go above and beyond. You want
[48:41] to, you know, work in the space where
[48:43] you directly, you know, impact the
[48:45] space, where you can directly put your
[48:46] time, energy, and labor into a product,
[48:48] service, or business that is going to
[48:50] benefit the the network and the
[48:51] protocol. So, that's kind of where I'm
[48:53] at and where a lot of other Bitcoiners
[48:55] that I've spoken to online, uh, uh, you
[48:57] know, that have made that jump are at
[48:59] have, you know, they where the point
[49:00] they were at before they made that jump.
[49:02] Um, I think it's just a feeling of
[49:04] wanting to do more and contribute more
[49:06] to the space and and further education
[49:08] and adoption. Absolutely. Really, I I
[49:10] can really um I can really relate to
[49:14] that a lot. Uh, I've asked one question
[49:16] to each and every one of my guests. Uh
[49:18] the question is what can we learn from
[49:20] you besides Bitcoin? Besides Bitcoin, uh
[49:22] I would say if you want to see change,
[49:26] be the change. So if you want to see the
[49:28] change, be the change. If you if you
[49:31] don't like the world now, then do
[49:32] something. Whether that's like you said,
[49:34] not Bitcoin related, whether that's
[49:35] Bitcoin related or not, if you want to
[49:37] see the world different in 10, 20, 30
[49:39] years or for your kids or your future
[49:41] grandchildren, then do something now
[49:43] about it. contribute to something that
[49:45] you think will positively impact the
[49:46] future and that's going to be different
[49:48] for everybody but you know chase your
[49:49] dreams um do impactful stuff and never
[49:53] stop learning that's what I would say
[49:54] very true really cool um as you know we
[49:56] have a routine in the podcast where the
[49:58] previous guest
[50:00] previous guest is asking a question for
[50:02] the next guest without knowing who the
[50:04] next guest actually is and your question
[50:06] from the previous guest is what are your
[50:09] thoughts on the field leverage games of
[50:11] micro strategy and do you think this
[50:13] could be dangerous for Bitcoin in any
[50:15] way. Great question. So, I don't want to
[50:17] give a super definitive like I know it
[50:19] all. This will be good or bad. From my,
[50:22] you know, from my naive view, I think
[50:24] that Michael Sailor knows what he's
[50:27] doing. I'm not going to say he's in he
[50:28] knows everything. I think he knows what
[50:30] he's doing. He has 30 plus years of
[50:32] experience um in markets, you know, as a
[50:35] CEO of this company. No, he's not a CEO
[50:37] anymore, but he he was the I think the
[50:38] longest standing CEO of any tech company
[50:40] if I remember correctly. and I think he
[50:42] weathered the biggest uh fall in stock
[50:44] price and kept his position through
[50:46] that. So, he has that on his side as
[50:48] well. Um, it's no different than real
[50:51] estate. That's the thing. It's it's it's
[50:53] no different than real estate. You're
[50:55] it's a it's a speculative attack on the
[50:56] dollar on fiat. It's you're shorting
[50:58] fiat and you're going long an asset that
[51:00] will outperform fiat that cannot be
[51:02] debased or printed out of thin air. So,
[51:05] I think there's risk there, but I think
[51:06] that the way he structures his loans,
[51:09] um, he's really mitigating his risk. So
[51:11] I am not super fearful but then again
[51:14] you just you should base your fear in
[51:16] your in your portfolio based on you know
[51:18] okay if you think there's this much risk
[51:20] then maybe you save a little bit more in
[51:21] Bitcoin and then you take a little bit
[51:23] less risk in micro strategy. So that's
[51:24] how I would look at it. I would you know
[51:26] if you want to take less risk save more
[51:27] Bitcoin you know maybe buy a little bit
[51:29] less strategy. I don't I don't know it's
[51:31] different for everybody. I'm not going
[51:32] to recommend portfolio allocations, but
[51:35] I do think that um I think that Michael
[51:38] Sailor and and Co kind of has it figured
[51:41] out. Um yeah, I think that they'll
[51:43] they'll be all right and they'll be able
[51:44] to weather the storm. I think it's a
[51:46] very normal thing to take out leverage
[51:48] to go long on assets that cannot be
[51:50] debased.
[51:52] Yeah. Yeah. And I think they do it
[51:53] actually in a in a very sensible way, in
[51:57] a very logical way. Uh and in not
[52:01] like they do it in a way where for me at
[52:04] least it seems very safe. You you also
[52:07] in you're also in micro strategy. I have
[52:09] a small position in strategy. Yep. Mhm.
[52:11] I have a small position. So I look at it
[52:13] like it like we talked about earlier. I
[52:15] look at it as um as taking risk on top
[52:17] of Bitcoin. So Bitcoin is the benchmark.
[52:18] Bitcoin is the baseline. It's the
[52:20] opportunity cost. Bitcoin is the hurdle
[52:21] rate. Anything on top of that is risk is
[52:23] investing. So that's that's how I look
[52:25] at it. I I allocate a small percentage
[52:27] to my investing portfolio. I think
[52:30] that's a great way to look at it. Uh
[52:31] Bitcoin as the hurdle rate. You said
[52:33] also something before I really liked it.
[52:36] Bitcoin is the opportunity cost. I love
[52:38] that. Thank you. Yes, it is. It totally
[52:41] is. Um and and I base any investment
[52:44] decision or purchase based off that. You
[52:46] know what what will these sats get me in
[52:48] the future versus what am I doing now?
[52:51] So, Bitcoin really is is the
[52:52] opportunity. And then that's sort of
[52:53] that might lead to hesitancy for certain
[52:55] people buying homes even. You know,
[52:58] everybody wants to save for a home, but
[52:59] then once you get there, well, if you
[53:01] buy a home, that that house is going to
[53:03] cost half as much Bitcoin in in four
[53:05] years and then maybe a quarter as much
[53:06] in eight years. So, it really makes you
[53:09] lower your time preference and weigh out
[53:10] your your consumption. Absolutely. Um,
[53:13] that that's really cool.
[53:14] Um, before I let you go, where can
[53:17] people find you, ask you questions, and
[53:18] and reach out to you?
[53:20] So, uh, the best bet for now would be
[53:23] LinkedIn. Um, I don't really I can
[53:25] provide a link for you. Uh, it's just
[53:26] Reese M. That that's it. Reys M. And
[53:29] then I have my, uh, my laser eye emoji.
[53:31] So, I I don't have any other um social
[53:34] pronouns. Yeah, Bitcoin only. That's it.
[53:36] Yeah, Bitcoin only. So, yeah, no other
[53:38] socials I'm going to plug quite yet. I'm
[53:40] still working on that stuff in the
[53:41] background. So, for now, I'm just going
[53:42] to stick with LinkedIn. It's just Reese
[53:44] M on LinkedIn. I'd love to connect with
[53:46] you. And you want to message me, that's
[53:48] perfectly fine. we can message and I can
[53:49] even answer questions or whatever. So,
[53:51] I'm I'm open to any conversation on
[53:53] there. Really cool. Thank you so much,
[53:55] Ree, for being on the show. Also, thank
[53:57] you so much for everyone that is
[53:58] watching and listening for joining us
[54:00] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[54:02] with another episode. Thanks. Appreciate
[54:03] it.
