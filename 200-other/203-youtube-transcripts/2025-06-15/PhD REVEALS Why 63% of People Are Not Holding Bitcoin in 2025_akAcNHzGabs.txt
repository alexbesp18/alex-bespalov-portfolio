[00:00] Maybe not yet, but in a couple of years,
[00:02] if you're a financial like responsible
[00:05] for the treasury of a company, you might
[00:07] have to explain specifically why you're
[00:09] not holding any Bitcoin uh in your cash
[00:11] reserves. Originally an economist uh did
[00:14] also my PhD in economics um mainly on uh
[00:18] Bitcoin investor behavior. I think
[00:20] Bitcoin mining is one of the key players
[00:22] that could arise in grid balancing and
[00:25] make a like just an amazing market-based
[00:27] solution. Right now, governments might
[00:29] pay hundreds of millions per year to uh
[00:32] renewable energy providers to curtail to
[00:35] shut down their energy production if
[00:37] there's too much energy in the grids.
[00:38] Instead of that, why not use Bitcoin
[00:41] miners to balance uh the load that is
[00:43] fluctuating due to rising renewable
[00:45] energy shares? Yeah, it's just the
[00:47] beginning of um people thinking about
[00:49] putting reserves, Bitcoin reserves in on
[00:52] balance sheets, etc.
[00:54] Yeah.
[00:55] [Music]
[00:57] Before we get started, uh maybe quickly
[01:01] uh tell us who you are and and why you
[01:03] into Bitcoin. Yeah. Um as you introduce
[01:07] me, I'm Yan Denfeld. So I'm originally
[01:10] an economist. Uh did also my PhD in e
[01:13] economics um mainly on uh Bitcoin
[01:17] investor behavior. Um finished that one
[01:20] last year around May, April. and since
[01:23] May now I'm working for man green techch
[01:25] uh Bitcoin mining company in Paris. Um
[01:30] yeah so uh my main focus what I'm mainly
[01:34] doing dayto-day is looking at uh bitcoin
[01:38] mining uh but also as my economics
[01:41] background financial markets uh
[01:43] political developments um so anything
[01:45] that is um related to data and
[01:48] analytical uh stuff that's what I um
[01:52] yeah I'm looking at most most of the
[01:54] time really interesting bitcoin h how
[01:57] was how was it when you uh trained
[01:59] basically in the traditional economics
[02:01] sense to unlearn this and and and learn
[02:03] the new Bitcoin economy. Um yeah, I mean
[02:07] it's as you said, you need to unlearn a
[02:10] lot. But um when I when I studied
[02:13] economics, I've always been very
[02:15] skeptical on all the theories we were
[02:18] taught. So I was always questioning a
[02:19] bit um the economic stuff we've been
[02:22] taught and the assumptions etc. So uh I
[02:26] didn't knew it back then because yeah I
[02:28] didn't look at like also in economics
[02:30] etc. But uh I think that helped me very
[02:33] much
[02:34] in learning about Bitcoin and also being
[02:37] open to um throwing basically the
[02:40] economic world upside down that I've
[02:42] been taught in um university. And uh but
[02:45] yeah, you're right. Generally, I think
[02:47] that's also why many economists maybe
[02:49] nowadays still don't get Bitcoin or just
[02:52] see it as a financial asset or
[02:53] something. Um, I mean it's it's coming
[02:56] that economists are starting to see it
[02:58] as an interesting asset to look at, but
[03:00] more because it's gaining more and more
[03:04] financial relevance in the world. Um,
[03:06] but it's I would say still not so much
[03:09] looked at as something that could turn
[03:12] our economic thinking upside down. Um,
[03:14] so it's more like a financial asset. And
[03:16] yeah, it's super interesting. Uh I'm
[03:19] also curious when the the shift comes
[03:23] from people having to explain why
[03:26] they're into Bitcoin and all the things
[03:28] and and rather have to explain let's say
[03:31] you are CFO of a company. Now if you
[03:34] want to uh adopt Bitcoin on the balance
[03:36] sheet you really have to do a lot of
[03:39] explaining why this is a good strategy.
[03:43] And I think there will be a certain
[03:45] point where you get asked as a CFO, if
[03:48] you don't have uh when you don't have a
[03:50] Bitcoin strategy, why you don't have a
[03:52] Bitcoin strategy? Like why why there's
[03:54] no Bitcoin on the balance sheet? I'm
[03:56] really curious when this whole
[03:58] traditional financial space kind of gets
[04:01] gets Bitcoin so good that it's obvious
[04:05] and the people that don't get it have to
[04:07] explain themselves, not the people that
[04:09] get it have to explain themselves. Yeah,
[04:11] absolutely. I mean right now it's we are
[04:13] starting to see that more and more. I
[04:15] mean we we get more and more Bitcoin
[04:16] treasury companies but they all coming
[04:18] more from I would say still from the
[04:21] Bitcoin space. So Bitcoin is then turn
[04:23] companies into Bitcoin companies. But I
[04:26] mean absolutely at some point any
[04:28] company that is holding a lot of uh cash
[04:31] reserves needs to justify why they're
[04:35] not holding Bitcoin. I think we we're
[04:37] slowly getting to that point. Um maybe
[04:40] not yet, but in a couple of years if
[04:43] you're a financial like responsible for
[04:46] the treasury of a company, uh you might
[04:48] have to explain specifically why you're
[04:51] not holding any Bitcoin uh in your cash
[04:54] reserves when you have a lot of I don't
[04:56] know US dollar reserves etc in your
[04:58] treasury. So um it's going to be
[05:01] interesting to see over time how that uh
[05:03] evolves and um yeah I think inevitably
[05:08] will become a more and more important
[05:09] topic over time. How do you look at the
[05:12] the past uh basically one two years that
[05:15] that happened with the ETFs with the
[05:17] strategic bitcoin reserve with all the
[05:20] it seems like very rapid uh pace
[05:22] adoption of of bitcoin as an asset.
[05:25] Yeah, I mean
[05:27] it's maybe it might seem I mean we're
[05:30] still just around 90 94,000 US, right?
[05:34] So people would have said we should be
[05:36] at uh half a million a million maybe. Um
[05:39] so from that perspective maybe you might
[05:41] say okay it's kind of a disappointing
[05:44] development but I
[05:47] mean sometimes we just uh overestimate
[05:50] how fast all these financial
[05:52] institutions are moving forward how fast
[05:55] companies make decisions and I think
[05:58] it's quite remarkable on the one hand I
[06:00] mean the ETFs they have been tremendous
[06:03] success but also like more and more big
[06:07] institutional investors are starting to
[06:09] consider Bitcoin if they're not already
[06:11] in Bitcoin. At least they now have to
[06:14] talk about in in like banks, financial
[06:16] companies, they're starting to at least
[06:19] talk about Bitcoin. And I
[06:22] guess even if they're not into it right
[06:24] now, um it just takes time for some of
[06:27] those bigger institutions and companies
[06:30] to at some point decide, okay, no, we
[06:34] are going to jump into Bitcoin. And I
[06:36] mean it involves a lot more than what we
[06:39] do. We can just say, "Okay, let's set up
[06:42] an account somewhere." We smash by
[06:44] Bitcoin. We don't have to think about
[06:48] um managing risks for like other
[06:51] investors because we're just our own
[06:53] investors. We don't have to um justify
[06:58] our safety system, etc. How we store
[07:00] Bitcoin and all that takes a lot of
[07:03] time. And uh it's just amazing to see
[07:05] how the narrative is shifting and even
[07:07] this week right now Bloomberg starting
[07:10] to talk about how Bitcoin has traded a
[07:14] little bit differently to the NASDAQ um
[07:16] for just maybe a couple of days but it's
[07:19] it's an interesting start.
[07:21] Yeah, this decoupling is is is is
[07:24] interesting. The the the dword is get
[07:26] getting used more and more for for the
[07:29] even traditional financial space. I mean
[07:31] yesterday for the people uh we we are
[07:34] now recording on 23rd of April. So this
[07:36] podcast will come out in May. So it's
[07:38] it's a a little uh further down the
[07:40] line. But yesterday I think yesterday
[07:43] was the day where Bitcoin went up and
[07:46] the whole market basically went down. Uh
[07:49] which is an amazing sign that the the
[07:54] market um slowly gets it. But I'm a very
[07:57] skeptical honestly because there's like
[07:59] it's just it's just a day or two. It's
[08:02] not a long trend and it can also be just
[08:05] a coincidence. No, absolutely. I mean um
[08:09] we've seen already a couple of times
[08:12] where people are um celebrating the big
[08:14] decoupling of Bitcoin from other assets
[08:17] and um but I think what I mean the more
[08:21] and more we are seeing these kind of um
[08:24] one-time events where people are
[08:25] starting about to talk about
[08:27] decoupling it's it's also starting to
[08:30] form a narrative around Bitcoin right so
[08:33] um that more and more people are
[08:35] thinking about wait a minute why are
[08:37] people talking about decoupling. Why are
[08:39] they talking about Bitcoin being digital
[08:41] gold? Is it maybe something we we have
[08:44] to look at? And um yeah, anytime we are
[08:48] seeing these one, two or three time
[08:50] three day events where Bitcoin kind of
[08:53] decouples from financial markets, um I
[08:57] think is just um embedding this
[08:59] narrative more and more into the
[09:01] mainstream or the financial mainstream.
[09:03] So basically when there's like a day or
[09:06] two where there is actually decoupling
[09:09] on that day because mainstream news and
[09:12] mainstream media is reporting on that
[09:15] there is a kind of narrative spinning
[09:18] around that it's actually decoupling and
[09:21] this could further decouple Bitcoin from
[09:23] the rest of it because there's a
[09:24] narrative starting in a sense. Yes. And
[09:26] I I mean it's also showing it that it
[09:29] could trade differently than other
[09:31] assets. But um yeah, of course um it
[09:34] takes a lot of time for people to see
[09:36] that way. And um I mean I don't have to
[09:39] tell you as a Bitcoiner, you know, um
[09:42] Bitcoin has all the characteristics to
[09:44] be like a decolorated asset or like a
[09:47] safe haven asset. Um a hedge against
[09:50] uncertainty. But in the end um if we are
[09:54] being honest many market participants
[09:57] still see it as a risk on assets or as
[09:59] an asset uh that trades when there's
[10:03] like when when stocks go up bitcoin also
[10:06] goes up. Um yeah, it just takes takes
[10:09] time to um for investors, for market
[10:13] participant to understand what Bitcoin
[10:16] truly is and that it's not just a
[10:18] short-term speculative flip where you
[10:21] can make a lot of um profit in the short
[10:23] term. How important do you think is is
[10:26] that narrative shift in the in the
[10:28] mainstream media? Is this just a
[10:30] consequence of of Bitcoin getting
[10:32] adopted or is it actually um making
[10:36] headways in the adoption for Bitcoin?
[10:40] Um so I think I'm I mean it it would
[10:44] have happened either way like this shift
[10:47] in narratives. Uh but of course they're
[10:49] now reinforcing uh mechanisms. So if uh
[10:53] Bitcoin behaves a certain way, maybe
[10:56] even if it's not true yet, and Mark like
[10:58] mainstream media starts talking about
[11:00] it, um then it's just reinforcing the
[11:03] idea that Bitcoin could be a safe asset
[11:06] or a decorated asset to traditional
[11:09] financial markets. And yeah, it's it's
[11:12] not one or the other, but it's just
[11:15] something um that's reinforcing it each
[11:17] other. Yeah. And it helps a lot that
[11:20] people like Larry think who are very
[11:22] respected in the traditional financial
[11:24] space say oh it's a flight to what is it
[11:27] flight to safety I think he said flight
[11:29] to quality something like that um that
[11:31] that
[11:32] really helps to shift the narrative in
[11:36] the uh mainstream media because there's
[11:38] always like what what we Bitcoiners talk
[11:41] about and and what the world actually
[11:43] thinks currently because we we maybe are
[11:47] I'm I'm curious actually on on on that
[11:50] question because of uh there's always
[11:51] this question how many people actually
[11:52] understand Bitcoin. We have the numbers
[11:54] of how many people have exposure to
[11:56] Bitcoin. They range from like 300
[11:58] million to 600 million people some
[12:00] something like like that. But how many
[12:03] of those actually do self custody? How
[12:05] many run their own nodes? How many have
[12:08] uh actually understood Bitcoin and have
[12:10] more of of like 100 hours in in the bank
[12:13] of it? It's a it's it's a hard thing to
[12:16] accomplish. And then it's like those
[12:18] people who have understanded and talked
[12:19] to each other have very different
[12:22] narratives than 99.9% of the world
[12:26] actually currently has and we have to
[12:28] push push that further somehow. Yeah, I
[12:31] think it's uh still a very low
[12:33] relatively no low number which are
[12:35] really like hardcore bitcoiners or
[12:37] understand bitcoin
[12:39] um what it is or what it might be. I
[12:42] mean, I'm not even sure I fully
[12:45] understand Bitcoin or anyone actually
[12:48] fully understands Bitcoin. I mean,
[12:50] there's so much to unpack regarding
[12:51] Bitcoin and we don't really know yet um
[12:55] all the potential it has down the line.
[12:57] So, but yeah, the ones that at least
[13:00] understood the
[13:03] fundamental proposition of Bitcoin, I
[13:05] think it's still also very relatively
[13:07] low number compared to all the holders
[13:09] we have um that are holding Bitcoin. Um
[13:12] I mean, we have so many holders today
[13:16] that just have Bitcoin exposure via ETFs
[13:19] and other products. So, and they don't
[13:22] self custody their Bitcoin. And um I
[13:25] think that's that makes a huge
[13:27] difference already if you are like a
[13:29] bitcoiner who says no but I have to hold
[13:31] my own keys and have that because that's
[13:33] what's it about right bitcoins have
[13:36] sovereignty and being free from
[13:38] political control etc. So yeah,
[13:42] absolutely. It's it's it's it's so
[13:44] interesting that you say that because I
[13:47] I'm I'm also very much the opinion that
[13:51] nobody really understands everything
[13:54] there that it's just too deep of a topic
[13:57] that you can fully understand something,
[13:59] but there's like a degree of of it and
[14:02] maybe we have to cut off like if you
[14:04] understand 60% of it, you you kind of
[14:07] grasp it uh and you count as someone
[14:09] that understands it or whatever the
[14:11] percentage
[14:12] is what do you think is the biggest
[14:15] thing or like the the biggest area in
[14:17] Bitcoin where you still want to learn
[14:20] more about Bitcoin?
[14:22] Um I mean me personally I come more from
[14:25] the let's say market side or the side
[14:30] where you look at transformative
[14:32] potentials of Bitcoin Bitcoin mining in
[14:34] Africa etc.
[14:36] Um so I for sure like a bit of more the
[14:42] technical understanding of Bitcoin um
[14:45] the like uh on the program level um
[14:49] coding level etc. Um I think that's some
[14:52] areas I would like to catch up a bit
[14:54] more. Um yeah and but everyone has like
[14:57] their niches around Bitcoin and then
[15:00] some areas they understand better and
[15:02] less less well it it's very important to
[15:05] to be aware of of of uh where you still
[15:09] want to learn more and yeah the
[15:10] technical aspect I think technically
[15:12] especially it's it's very hard to
[15:14] understand everything in in great detail
[15:16] especially if you go deeper on uh all
[15:19] the aspects uh but like uh yeah really
[15:22] cool um one thing that was uh before
[15:25] when you talked about the the price why
[15:28] we are not at at at half a million or a
[15:30] million or something like that. I asked
[15:31] myself that a lot actually. It for me
[15:33] it's a blessing. It's like I'm I'm so
[15:35] grateful for that because I would have a
[15:37] lot less exposure to Bitcoin if if
[15:40] Bitcoin would have shot to like a
[15:42] million last year. But why do you think
[15:46] this is like for me it's so obvious to
[15:49] see all the developments that happening
[15:51] and and all the question that are kind
[15:54] of in Bitcoin kind of already solved and
[15:57] if you look back 10 years there were so
[15:59] many open questions that are uh still to
[16:03] to be uh interested to figure out like
[16:06] the the blocks as wars we had we had the
[16:08] ETFs now we have so many things that you
[16:10] have seen uh can bitcoin withstand that
[16:13] can bitcoin and actually reach those
[16:15] levels. We have seen so many of that
[16:17] already that it's kind of unbelievable
[16:19] that we are still at just 100K. Yeah, I
[16:23] mean it's kind of unbelievable. But
[16:25] also, I mean, I'm not going to say it's
[16:28] something about uh market manipulation
[16:30] or something because I don't think so. I
[16:32] think it just comes down to mainly
[16:34] information asymmetry. Um, as we've
[16:37] spoke about, some people already see the
[16:39] value proposition, some don't. Um, so we
[16:43] also have a lot of people ready to sell
[16:46] at 100K and we've seen people sell at
[16:49] 100K. Um, so it's just like for me it
[16:52] comes down to information asymmetry and
[16:54] people not grasping what Bitcoin is yet.
[16:57] So yeah, absolutely. And I mean of
[17:00] course we've seen big demand by micro
[17:04] strategy, by ETFs, but I think it's not
[17:08] as significant yet. um
[17:11] that justifies to me that we had a
[17:14] scream like there's market manipulation
[17:16] going on or something. Of course,
[17:17] there's always manipulation going on in
[17:19] markets irrespective of Bitcoin, but I
[17:22] don't think that's the reason why we are
[17:24] at the price where we are yet. It's
[17:26] Yeah, some people also confuse in my
[17:29] opinion buying and selling with market
[17:31] manipulation. Yeah, this is
[17:33] like people say, "Oh, but what if this
[17:36] big OG sells a lot of Bitcoin and and
[17:38] manipulates the market?" I'm like,
[17:40] "That's not like that's that's a free
[17:42] market. That's buy buy and sell, supply
[17:46] and demand." That that's normal. Like, I
[17:48] mean, buy and sell supply and demand is
[17:50] just what is natural. And I mean, you
[17:54] could argue there's
[17:56] some if if it were true that um
[17:59] exchanges don't hold the Bitcoin they
[18:00] actually have, then it's in a sense
[18:02] market manipulation or suppression. But
[18:05] um I'm not sure that this is actually
[18:07] the case or like um I don't think they
[18:11] can to s such an extent um inflate the
[18:15] supply on exchanges without having um so
[18:17] many like the bitcoin actually backed
[18:19] and yeah that it has an effect on the
[18:23] price where if without exchanges we
[18:25] would always be at uh triple the price
[18:28] or something. So yeah, it's just a
[18:30] short-term thing. I think uh you you you
[18:32] can do it shortterm but I mean we have
[18:35] seen example like FDX how many bitcoin
[18:37] did they actually hold like two or
[18:39] something like some ridiculously small
[18:41] amount of bitcoin they actually held um
[18:44] versus how many they actually should
[18:46] have held.
[18:47] So it's just a question of time if black
[18:51] or anything anyone actually does that. I
[18:54] mean, Black Rock, if they they do it,
[18:56] they probably are a little bit smarter
[18:58] than FDX, but but if someone does it, I
[19:01] think it's just a matter of time till
[19:03] the the the thing is is crashing. Yeah.
[19:06] And I mean, if if you look right now at
[19:08] the institutions holding the Bitcoin,
[19:11] like Coinbase holds the majority of
[19:13] Bitcoin for Bitcoin spot ETFs, and they
[19:16] are all highly regulated. And I don't
[19:18] think they have anything to gain by
[19:21] pretending that there's Bitcoin that
[19:23] they actually don't have because the
[19:26] risk of this coming out and blowing up
[19:28] is way too high for like Coinbase or
[19:31] even I mean I don't see why Black Rockck
[19:34] should pretend that they don't have the
[19:36] Bitcoin they have. Um I mean that would
[19:38] be on the one hand it's still a
[19:41] relatively marginal business for those
[19:44] asset managers. Um, so it's simply not
[19:46] worth the reputational risk to say,
[19:48] "Okay, um, let's pretend we held the
[19:51] Bitcoin while we don't actually have
[19:53] them." Um, so I don't really say why why
[19:55] they should do that. Um, yeah, it's a
[19:59] it's a it's a good point. It's they they
[20:02] don't have an incentive, and I'm a big
[20:04] believer in incentives. like if if you
[20:07] if someone has a huge incentive to
[20:09] manipulate the Bitcoin price and at the
[20:12] same time if he gets caught doesn't blow
[20:15] up his own business like Coinbase would
[20:17] blow up his own business if they if they
[20:20] come to know of like oh they just have
[20:22] like 100 Bitcoin or something like that
[20:24] and they should have like a million or
[20:26] some whatever the the amount is they
[20:28] they are holding that would basically
[20:31] ruin their whole business and would
[20:35] probably uh bankrupt then uh I don't
[20:38] know but probably so why would they risk
[20:42] something we we know an exchange on its
[20:45] own without doing the tricks is quite
[20:48] profitable so yeah why the heck would
[20:51] they do it and and I mean Coinbase is
[20:53] not itself that much in the accumulating
[20:56] Bitcoin business it themselves they not
[20:59] holding too many Bitcoin so why I mean
[21:02] they doesn't make sense for them to
[21:04] suppress press price to be able to
[21:06] themselves accumulate cheaper because
[21:08] they don't really we are not really
[21:10] seeing them buying that much bitcoin. So
[21:14] yeah, I think um around that area um we
[21:19] can't be for sure, but um it's to me it
[21:21] makes more sense that they have the
[21:23] Bitcoin they are selling and not Yeah.
[21:26] that they not paper Bitcoin in a sense.
[21:28] But yeah, it's it's it's kind of
[21:29] unbelievable that we already are where
[21:32] we are with with also strategic Bitcoin
[21:34] reserves. What do you think is is is
[21:37] next for for Bitcoin? What is what is
[21:39] the next thing that that you kind of
[21:41] foresee? Um I mean what we are talking
[21:44] about right now is Bitcoin reserves
[21:46] obviously of countries. I don't know
[21:49] who's going to be the next country doing
[21:51] that. I think that's something that's
[21:54] going to happen um at some point. Not
[21:57] sure if the US is actually going to
[21:58] actually like actively buy Bitcoin
[22:01] again. Um but yeah, I think around that
[22:04] topic we will see more more and more
[22:06] happening and for sure we spoke about a
[22:09] bitcoin treasury companies companies um
[22:13] adopting Bitcoin. Uh I think that's also
[22:15] I mean it's already a hot topic right
[22:17] now. It's being discussed in the Bitcoin
[22:19] circle and um I think that's one thing
[22:22] that's going to
[22:24] become more and more relevant over the
[22:26] coming years.
[22:28] Yeah, it's the the topic that Bitcoin
[22:30] will drain the monetary premium from all
[22:33] all other assets slowly slowly and we're
[22:36] seeing just the beginning of that I I
[22:40] think right now. Yeah. Yeah. It's I mean
[22:42] we haven't seen anything yet. It's just
[22:45] uh a few crazy bitcoiners doing that as
[22:48] a treasury strategy and maybe of course
[22:51] you have Tesla etc. But um yeah, it's
[22:54] just the beginning of um people thinking
[22:58] about putting reserves, Bitcoin reserves
[23:00] in balance on balance sheets, etc. Yeah.
[23:02] How do you think this this will go when
[23:05] uh monetary premium will continue to be
[23:09] absorbed by Bitcoin, from real estate,
[23:12] from stocks, from treasuries, from
[23:13] basically everything that that is is
[23:16] qualifying as a store of value
[23:17] currently? What do you mean as in
[23:20] consequences or Yeah, the consequence of
[23:23] that if if Bitcoin is is more and more
[23:26] doing that, how will the the global
[23:28] asset market basically change when when
[23:30] Bitcoin is the primary or maybe even the
[23:32] default asset for everyone to use as a
[23:34] store of value? I mean, it's a tough
[23:37] question to answer.
[23:39] Um it depends on on the speed that is
[23:43] happening because if it's happening
[23:44] relatively fast and uh let's say real
[23:48] estate is increasingly becoming
[23:50] unattractive as a store of value
[23:54] um we will see like severe consequences
[23:57] on these kind of markets with prices
[23:59] dropping. Um and of course many people
[24:02] have um maybe use their real estate as
[24:05] collateral and right if that goes down
[24:08] it's it's not ideal if you if your
[24:11] cattle drops in value uh against what
[24:14] you've borrowed. Um but I've to be
[24:19] honest it's hard to say how that's going
[24:21] to happen and the consequences. I'm I'm
[24:24] wondering if if real estate actually
[24:27] ever drops in value when you compare it
[24:30] to US dollar. U because for me it's like
[24:33] then then it's it is crashing already
[24:36] and probably will crash against Bitcoin.
[24:39] But US dollar is probably crashing more
[24:42] than than than real estate. It's like
[24:44] the the the scarce asset versus the the
[24:46] the infinite asset, I guess. Yeah. Yeah.
[24:49] I mean that's a good point. If if you
[24:53] see what like if other assets are being
[24:55] demonetized that also means that fiat
[24:59] currencies are in a sense being devalued
[25:02] um because I mean once people start um
[25:05] shifting from real estate etc to Bitcoin
[25:09] why shouldn't they also start to shift
[25:11] from US dollars or or euros or whatever
[25:15] currency you're talking about to Bitcoin
[25:17] itself and of course that will
[25:20] accelerate accelerate the depreciation
[25:22] of fiat currencies against Bitcoin as
[25:25] well and also against possibly assets.
[25:28] Yeah, this the spending of Bitcoin is an
[25:31] is an interesting topic. Are you are you
[25:33] at all at for you you probably still use
[25:37] Fiat for for spending or are you already
[25:40] starting to use Bitcoin here and there
[25:42] as medium of exchange? M I I mean I use
[25:44] it anytime I can, but I it's still very
[25:48] limited uh at least in the physical
[25:51] space if you go to stores. So yeah, I'm
[25:53] still of course using a lot of feats for
[25:55] day-to-day life. Let's take a break for
[25:57] a moment and appreciate the beauty that
[26:00] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[26:03] watches. Those watches are the most
[26:06] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[26:08] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[26:11] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[26:13] completely new and amazing Genesis
[26:16] edition of their watch collections. You
[26:19] have the date of the first ever minded
[26:22] Bitcoin block in there. And of course,
[26:25] also the block height and which epoch we
[26:28] are currently in. I love the level of
[26:31] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[26:34] Make sure to check out those amazing
[26:36] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[26:39] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[26:42] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[26:44] really do hope that you don't have it on
[26:47] exchange. But if you do have it on
[26:48] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[26:50] deal with that. The first way is you put
[26:53] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[26:55] entry for you to get into the
[26:57] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[27:00] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[27:03] super simple and secure way. And if you
[27:06] check out the link in the description,
[27:08] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[27:11] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[27:14] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[27:17] partner in terms of how to get the most
[27:20] out of your sovereignty. They will
[27:23] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[27:26] that is perfect for your individual
[27:29] situation. They will show you how you
[27:31] can secure your own devices. Securing
[27:34] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[27:36] have to keep all your devices secure.
[27:38] One topic that is overlooked often is
[27:40] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[27:43] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[27:46] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[27:48] place already? And last but not least,
[27:50] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[27:52] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[27:55] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[28:00] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[28:03] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[28:06] will be for the first time ever speaking
[28:08] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[28:11] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[28:14] really looking forward to seeing all of
[28:16] you there. You can get your ticket in
[28:18] the link down in the description of
[28:20] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[28:23] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[28:26] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[28:28] there. I mean, there there are things
[28:30] like uh credit credit. I mean, I I've
[28:34] I've not seen it yet. I've not
[28:36] experienced that. also uh in in Europe,
[28:38] but I I heard a lot of people talk about
[28:41] that especially in America where they
[28:43] have a credit card which is basically
[28:46] deducting uh from from from Bitcoin with
[28:48] some mechanism. Um or you have a credit
[28:51] card that you pay off once a month with
[28:53] your Bitcoin with from thing does this
[28:56] things but that's not really a Bitcoin
[28:59] as medium of exchange. just like selling
[29:02] Bitcoin at market price when you buy it
[29:04] and directly converted it to fiat. It's
[29:07] not a real med exchange. No, I'm I'm
[29:09] more a bigger fan of um these circular
[29:12] economies where you can spend your
[29:14] bitcoin and it actually stays there. So
[29:16] like the shop owner is not immediately
[29:18] converting it to local fiat currencies.
[29:21] So it's uh where as you say it's more of
[29:24] an actual medium of exchange because if
[29:26] you use the credit cards of course you
[29:29] personally live on a Bitcoin standard um
[29:32] but on the other side where you're
[29:34] paying this person doesn't have any
[29:36] touch point at all with Bitcoin and it
[29:39] doesn't they don't even see right that
[29:42] you're paying with Bitcoin because they
[29:44] just receive whatever fiat currency
[29:46] immediately to their account and I think
[29:50] it makes a lot of sense if you
[29:52] personally want to live on a bitcoin
[29:53] standard. But uh I I think uh the way to
[29:57] go long run is uh wherever you can spend
[30:00] bitcoin uh with a bitcoin business um
[30:03] you just you use your money and like
[30:05] your bitcoin and spend on because then
[30:08] it ends up in a in the hands of another
[30:10] bitcoiner. it's not being converted back
[30:12] to Fiat, then you're kind of creating uh
[30:16] um like another economy on the side and
[30:20] I think that's the one where things get
[30:24] interesting. So like the circular
[30:25] economy projects in Africa and Latin
[30:29] America etc. Um that's the things which
[30:33] I think are more exciting in terms of
[30:35] Bitcoin as me of means of exchange.
[30:38] How important do you think uh those
[30:40] circular economies and Bitcoin as a mean
[30:44] of exchange
[30:46] is for Bitcoin also as a store of value?
[30:49] Like how how necessary is is is that for
[30:52] it being the uh adopted also as a store
[30:55] of value?
[30:57] I think right now it's maybe not as
[30:59] important yet. Uh but it's it's pretty
[31:03] amazing and very important that people
[31:04] are working on these kind of circular
[31:06] economies.
[31:08] Um basically just also to showcase the
[31:11] world okay you can also live on a
[31:13] bitcoin standard and it actually works
[31:15] then it's not something that is uh in
[31:19] the distant future maybe 50 years ahead.
[31:22] Uh, so you can actually live on a
[31:25] Bitcoin standard. You can use Bitcoin,
[31:27] you can pay with it. And so it's not
[31:31] maybe not as important yet, but I think
[31:33] it's extremely important work that
[31:35] people are doing right now that are
[31:37] trying to establish circular economies.
[31:40] Um, yeah,
[31:42] I had poof on a couple of episodes ago
[31:45] or like a couple of weeks ago and he
[31:47] said something that I'm battling since
[31:51] ever since then and I also heard it
[31:54] discussed a lot online. He said if
[31:57] Bitcoin fails as a medium of exchange,
[31:59] it will also fail as a store of value.
[32:03] And the more I think about it, the more
[32:05] I disagree with that. Okay.
[32:08] But because like you can make an
[32:10] argument that gold has has has kind of
[32:14] failed as a media exchange, but it's
[32:16] still a great store of value. I mean,
[32:18] you can define now how great it actually
[32:20] is, but it's the biggest asset um on the
[32:23] on the planet. Um obviously it could be
[32:26] way better because most people don't use
[32:29] gold as a medium exchange. Most people
[32:31] as a store of value. Most people use
[32:33] like real estate or stocks or something
[32:35] like that. So in a way it also hasn't
[32:38] fulfilled the full potential it has as a
[32:42] store of value. How do you look at how
[32:45] how do you look at that statement from
[32:46] him? Yeah, I've seen that statement on
[32:50] Twitter, I think. Um I tend to agree a
[32:53] bit with him, but I'm on the same page
[32:55] as you. I need to uh think more about
[32:57] it. Um as you said gold has been fine
[33:01] without being actually a medium of
[33:03] exchange uh over the last I don't know
[33:07] at least decades. Um it was not even
[33:10] like before that you can argue okay the
[33:12] US has been backed by gold and fiat
[33:14] currencies have been um backed by gold.
[33:19] Um yeah so I think in the short run to
[33:22] medium run it does not matter but
[33:26] um the more we I mean ideally we would
[33:30] see more more and more is being used as
[33:32] a medium of exchange at least in some
[33:35] countries where currencies are highly
[33:37] volatile as well because I mean right
[33:40] now
[33:42] um here in Europe of course the euro is
[33:46] not the most the best currency it's uh
[33:48] it's it's going down in value over time.
[33:50] We have inflation, but at least it does
[33:53] not fluctuate that much. So, I can at
[33:56] least
[33:57] be a bit more certain about what I can
[34:00] buy tomorrow as well with my euro um
[34:03] compared to today. Um not not in the
[34:05] medium run, of course. I know I will use
[34:07] lose value by holding euros.
[34:10] Um but yeah, I think we're seeing first
[34:15] Bitcoin become adopted more and more as
[34:17] a as a store of value, which also means
[34:20] that we see volatility drop. And then I
[34:24] think it makes also more sense to for
[34:26] many people to use Bitcoin as a medium
[34:28] of exchange when it becomes less
[34:31] volatile particularly in countries that
[34:33] are already experiencing highly volatile
[34:36] uh currencies uh that can be devalued
[34:40] overnight that see high inflation and
[34:41] then uh even Bitcoin I mean even now
[34:45] Bitcoin in some countries like
[34:47] Zimbabwe might be a better choice than
[34:49] the local currency simply because the
[34:51] local currency is so and fluctuating or
[34:55] losing value so fast that even the
[34:57] strong volatility of Bitcoin is better
[35:00] than just holding a local
[35:02] currency. Yeah, is there another topic
[35:05] where I'm I'm amazed how Argentina and
[35:10] and countries like that don't get to the
[35:14] best money of Bitcoin. They they
[35:16] rather go to the US dollar which is a
[35:19] better fiat currencies than their own.
[35:21] So, and I'm seeing it all over the place
[35:22] where where people are kind of making
[35:25] the small baby step to a better fiat
[35:27] currency. I mean, obviously, if you have
[35:29] a currency that is inflated with like
[35:31] 100 150%, the US dollar seems like an
[35:35] amazing store of value against against
[35:37] that, but it's still really highly
[35:40] inflated away against Bitcoin. So, it's
[35:44] kind of interesting. But I mean, I'm I'm
[35:46] not blaming them because I'm not like
[35:49] 100. I mean, I'm I'm heavily into
[35:52] Bitcoin, but I still have uh some euros
[35:55] on my bank account that I use for my
[35:57] day-to-day use.
[35:58] And I mean, who am I then to tell people
[36:02] they should live 100% on Bitcoin in uh
[36:05] developing countries when it's highly
[36:07] volatile? And I mean that's also why
[36:09] we're seeing a lot of stable coin
[36:12] adoption even if you have all the
[36:14] counterparty risk that thinking about is
[36:17] the stable coin actually backed by US
[36:19] dollars or backed by US treasuries etc.
[36:23] But I mean for them it's a way better
[36:25] solution than using the local currency
[36:28] for day-to-day trading or day-to-day
[36:30] activity. So yeah.
[36:34] Yeah. I mean I guess uh for for medium
[36:37] exchange it makes a lot more more sense
[36:40] especially like short term. Um you don't
[36:43] want to have a situation where you have
[36:45] a big expense uh right when Bitcoin
[36:47] dropped a lot. Uh but at the same time
[36:50] this the more I think about it the more
[36:53] it's like that that's all kind of market
[36:55] timing. that that's why I'm I'm right
[36:59] now in a trans transitioning phase of
[37:01] how to set up my life 100% on Bitcoin
[37:04] even though maybe I have to to sell and
[37:07] and things like that. Uh but I want to
[37:10] get more and more away from using my
[37:12] bank account if that makes sense. Yeah,
[37:15] makes sense. I've se and I'm really
[37:17] curious on what's your take on it
[37:18] because I've now uh with my podcasting
[37:22] business I have a fiat income stream and
[37:24] a bitcoin income stream. The Bitcoin
[37:25] income stream is actually a lot bigger
[37:28] than than the fiat income stream. And I
[37:30] have a fiat expense stream and a fiat a
[37:33] bitcoin expense stream. And what what
[37:36] I've noticed ever since I earn and spend
[37:39] in bitcoin like directly, never even
[37:41] touching uh any fiat rails and also the
[37:45] uh the sender is is is in Bitcoin and
[37:47] the receiver is is in Bitcoin and and
[37:50] keeps the bitcoin.
[37:52] Also, I have I I have cared about the
[37:56] Bitcoin price on a day-to-day maybe 10%
[37:58] and now it completely dropped to like
[38:00] maybe 1% and uh because I don't buy
[38:04] Bitcoin anymore on an exchange. I've not
[38:06] touched an exchange for I think four to
[38:09] five maybe six months, I don't know. uh
[38:12] because my fiat and bitcoin stream is is
[38:16] is so nicely split that I can pay the
[38:18] fiat expenses and the bitcoin expenses
[38:21] which is an amazing thing but I probably
[38:23] have to exchange in the future more this
[38:26] will not always stay like
[38:27] that but that's why I'm more into the
[38:32] idea that I just have my
[38:36] bitcoin wallet and I have a fiat bank
[38:40] account for emergencies where I'm like,
[38:42] "Okay, let's have €5,000 there." It's
[38:45] just like if I really have an emergency
[38:47] and like, "Okay, then then let's spend
[38:50] that." And I have my Bitcoin to fiat
[38:54] rails like there's bull bitcoin that
[38:56] offers something. There's like lot of
[38:58] different um service providers that
[39:01] offer you you can pay someone directly
[39:03] to an ibon with bitcoin and and all all
[39:05] those things and the credit cards backed
[39:07] on bitcoin. And me personally, just on a
[39:10] Bitcoin standard, I I like I'm I'm not
[39:13] there yet and I'm not I'm not sure if
[39:15] it's the best way, but I think that's
[39:16] for me the most peace of mind stand uh
[39:21] status that I could be. Absolutely
[39:23] agree. I mean, that's what I've been
[39:25] seeing when I spoke to people living
[39:27] kind of on a Bitcoin standard in
[39:29] circular economies. And for them, it's
[39:32] just like, okay, I have my my my Bitcoin
[39:34] stack on my wallet. It doesn't I mean
[39:37] they they're not as affected anymore by
[39:41] these day-to-day fluctuations because
[39:43] simply they look at okay how many ss do
[39:45] I spend on on a coffee. Uh so yeah it
[39:49] you you shift a bit your perspective on
[39:52] fluctuations etc. And of course I spoke
[39:54] to some of them and they said yeah if
[39:56] you're long enough in
[39:57] Bitcoin in any case you will be spending
[40:00] your
[40:01] Bitcoin at a profit in a sense. So even
[40:05] if it fluctuates uh day to day or even
[40:08] months to months, you will still be like
[40:11] spending your bitcoin at a value that is
[40:13] higher as as if you would have held like
[40:16] in euros um for like the last four or
[40:19] five years. So yeah, it's just a a shift
[40:22] of perspective in a sense. Yeah, it's
[40:25] also the emotional detachment from the
[40:29] Bitcoin price. Uh, and I and I see it
[40:32] all all the time on Twitter, especially
[40:34] now that we have a runup. Welcome back
[40:37] 88K. Welcome back 89K. I'm like, who
[40:40] cares? Yeah, I mean, I would care if
[40:43] Bitcoin jumps today from, let's say, 95K
[40:46] to 150K. That that's a jump. Oh, like
[40:49]  what happened there? I probably
[40:51] making a a small emergency solo episode
[40:54] on on on on the podcast. But everything
[40:58] like Bitcoin has to move in a day more
[41:01] than 15% that I get even a little bit
[41:03] excited up and down. Yeah. Yeah. Also
[41:07] like of course we're seeing Bitcoin move
[41:09] up right now, but doesn't mean it can't
[41:11] move down again to 80K. So it's
[41:14] like Bitcoin Twitter is celebrating it
[41:17] as if as if we are now running towards
[41:21] much much higher prices. But uh it's
[41:24] just a I mean a very tiny insignificant
[41:27] move in a sense. Um yeah. So but but is
[41:31] that important? Do do you think that
[41:33] there's some value in in in that that
[41:36] small celebrations?
[41:39] I mean it's it's valuable in creating
[41:42] hype and uh narratives of course. Yeah.
[41:47] So and I mean I get it. Uh it's it's
[41:51] great to see when what you have in
[41:54] Bitcoin theoretically could buy you more
[41:57] now.
[41:58] Um for I mean for me the Bitcoin price
[42:01] itself is more of course it's nice as
[42:05] well for me to see what I have in
[42:08] Bitcoin is becoming more valuable and
[42:10] fiat currency. Um, but it's more of for
[42:14] me it's also like a sign of if we're
[42:17] trending up longterm that Bitcoin is
[42:19] being adopted more and more that Bitcoin
[42:22] is becoming more and more entrenched in
[42:24] the system like the Trojan horse
[42:27] basically.
[42:28] Um, and I mean that's why I'm mostly
[42:32] excited about price going up because it
[42:35] means adoption going up and the
[42:38] potential to change the systems we have
[42:40] right now is yeah simply going up.
[42:44] Really really cool. Um, one thing that I
[42:47] want to also touch on with with you is
[42:48] is mining as you're now working in in in
[42:51] mining. I think you also worked
[42:54] before maybe I got this completely wrong
[42:56] but I I've I connected you with Terra
[42:59] Hash before some some somehow maybe
[43:01] wrong. Yeah, I've been like a Teres
[43:03] representative for a bit of time. Yeah.
[43:06] So I've not been um working directly
[43:10] with them but um mainly as a
[43:12] representative to help them out on stuff
[43:15] etc. Yeah. How how do you look at uh
[43:19] Bitcoin mining right now and what is
[43:22] kind of like exciting you on on on that
[43:24] space?
[43:25] I mean it's a very challenging business
[43:29] right now but I'm extremely excited
[43:31] about all these topics surrounding
[43:35] um on the one
[43:36] hand bitcoin mining and micro grids. So
[43:39] what is grid list is doing um because
[43:42] I'm coming more from the development
[43:44] economics perspective. So I've looked a
[43:46] lot about on economics surrounding
[43:49] Africa, Latin America etc. So um it's
[43:52] pretty exciting to see what they're
[43:54] doing there making micro grids
[43:56] economically viable by uh essentially
[44:00] taking up any surplus energy and
[44:03] um anything that is um helping with like
[44:07] fostering economic growth in those areas
[44:09] that is not dependent on development
[44:12] aid, development financing. I think
[44:14] that's amazing. Um, so I hope we are
[44:17] going to see more and more of that in be
[44:20] it Africa, Latin America or any other
[44:22] country where people are planning to set
[44:26] up micro grids to bring
[44:28] electrification. And what more and more
[44:31] is happening now is also grid balancing
[44:33] of Bitcoin mining. Even in Europe, we
[44:37] see more and more players coming up
[44:38] right now using Bitcoin mining to
[44:41] balance a grid. I mean we we see more
[44:45] and more rising shares of re renewable
[44:47] energies in our electricity grids right
[44:49] in Europe and that means also we see
[44:53] more and more fluctuations in the energy
[44:55] supply and I think Bitcoin mining is one
[44:59] of the key players uh that could arise
[45:02] in grid balancing and make a like just
[45:05] an amazing market-based solution uh
[45:08] where um right now governments might pay
[45:12] hundreds of millions uh in euros per
[45:15] year to
[45:17] uh renewable energy providers to curtail
[45:20] to shut off uh shut down their energy
[45:22] production if there's too much energy in
[45:25] the grids. Um and instead of that, why
[45:27] not use Bitcoin miners to balance uh the
[45:31] load that is fluctuating due to rising
[45:33] renewable energy shares? So that's
[45:36] that's one area I'm pretty excited about
[45:38] right now in Bitcoin mining. It's kind
[45:41] of amazing to me, and I learned this
[45:43] only with Bitcoin mining, that there's
[45:46] too much energy sometimes, and people
[45:49] pay to get rid of it. It's it's it's
[45:52] it's a weird concept for me where
[45:54] there's excess energy and and they they
[45:56] might even pay for that while they're
[45:59] not getting paid for it when they just
[46:02] plug into a Bitcoin miner. I mean, this
[46:05] seems pretty obviously because right now
[46:07] people or governments pay for it. uh
[46:10] either um to maybe for example shut shut
[46:14] down wind power uh temporarily if
[46:17] there's too much energy in the nets
[46:19] because otherwise you will risk like the
[46:21] whole energy grid that it breaks down or
[46:24] if you export it to other countries
[46:26] you're basically paying the consumers or
[46:29] the other countries to take up your
[46:31] excess excess energy and yeah it's it's
[46:35] not a great solution I would say to pay
[46:37] others hey I sorry I produce too much
[46:39] energy. I don't know what to do. It's um
[46:42] I pay you one or two cents per kilowatt
[46:44] hour so that you take my energy because
[46:46] I don't know where to put it. And um
[46:50] that's I mean it just makes sense to use
[46:53] that energy to generate uh bitcoin
[46:57] or also to simply just you you don't
[47:01] even I mean that's the amazing thing
[47:04] about all those grit balancing
[47:05] operations. you don't even necessarily
[47:07] need to make a lot of profit on Bitcoin
[47:10] mining, but um simply because you can
[47:13] provide a service to the grid provider
[47:15] that is to stabilize the grid.
[47:18] Um like you're already getting getting
[47:21] paid for that service that you're
[47:23] basically a backup to the grid which can
[47:25] power up and down depending on the needs
[47:27] of the electricity grids. Um so that's
[47:30] um just simply
[47:33] amazing amazing use case for Bitcoin.
[47:35] Yeah, you you're getting you're getting
[47:38] paid for being ready to take up
[47:40] electricity
[47:42] and then you can actually take it up and
[47:45] also make money with that electricity.
[47:47] It's it it's kind of amazing and usually
[47:49] you take up the energy when it's cheap
[47:52] because um then there's a lot of energy,
[47:54] excess energy. So you don't pay you
[47:57] likely don't not going to pay the market
[47:59] rate but a lower rate um to take up the
[48:02] energy. Yeah. really really interesting.
[48:05] I love that. Um, one thing with with
[48:08] people that are working in Bitcoin, I'm
[48:10] always wondering how how Bitcoin has
[48:12] impacted uh your your life. I mean, the
[48:16] obvious of course my day-to-day life is
[48:20] Bitcoin um reading about Bitcoin or
[48:22] understanding the uh transformative
[48:25] potentials of Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining.
[48:28] Um but yeah, I don't the personal
[48:32] impact. Good
[48:34] question. Maybe I'm a bit more conscious
[48:37] about consumption, but I I don't want to
[48:39] say it has totally turned my way of life
[48:43] upside down. Um, in a sense like other
[48:46] Bitcoiners I say they completely live
[48:50] now life uh frugal life where they don't
[48:53] spend anymore and stuff like that. So
[48:55] it's more it's more that it leads me to
[48:59] think more about topics and also it
[49:02] makes me a bit more hopeful about the
[49:04] future of the world because uh yeah if
[49:07] you follow the news etc you might think
[49:10] the world is ending in 5 years and
[49:12] everything is bad and so in a sense uh
[49:15] it makes me also a bit more positive for
[49:17] the future being a bitcoiner 100% I love
[49:20] that um I asked uh each and every one of
[49:23] my guests uh one one question uh and the
[49:26] question is what can we learn from you
[49:28] besides Bitcoin?
[49:30] Um h give me a second I need to think
[49:33] about
[49:34] it. Um I mean besides
[49:38] Bitcoin
[49:40] I'm very much about nature conservation
[49:43] natural like
[49:45] um around yeah nature conservation I'm
[49:49] very focused on that. Um for example
[49:52] like uh after my PhD I took some time
[49:56] off uh spent like uh 3 months in South
[49:58] Africa in the bush and learned to be uh
[50:02] a safari guide basically. Um so learned
[50:04] a lot about nature and how everything
[50:07] interconnects and why it's important to
[50:09] conserve nature in Africa but anywhere
[50:11] else as well. And yeah I love that.
[50:14] That's a that's a great one. Really
[50:16] really cool. Um, we have an endain in
[50:18] the podcast where where the previous
[50:20] guest is asking a question for the next
[50:21] guest without knowing who the next guest
[50:23] actually is. And the previous guest asks
[50:25] you the question, which industry do you
[50:28] think will be most affected by Bitcoin
[50:30] in the next 10 years besides finances
[50:33] and why?
[50:35] Um, I think it's going to be the energy
[50:38] industry. Um, we already spoke about
[50:41] that. Um, there's so many use cases
[50:43] around Bitcoin mining. Um I don't know
[50:46] who said that but uh someone in the
[50:49] Bitcoin space uh basically
[50:51] said any energy company that uh doesn't
[50:56] mine Bitcoin or isn't somehow um into
[50:59] Bitcoin mining in the next uh 5 to 10
[51:02] years is going to be left behind. Um so
[51:06] yeah it's it's it's um I think that's
[51:08] going to be the next big thing around
[51:10] grid balancing but also gas
[51:13] flaring and all these topics where
[51:15] simply Bitcoin mining makes sense to be
[51:19] there to take up anything that is uh
[51:21] wasted otherwise
[51:23] 100% the the was kind of obvious for for
[51:27] me the energy in this industry uh as as
[51:30] an answer u but yeah it's yeah it's
[51:33] really interesting how how energy will
[51:34] be how the energy producers will
[51:38] discover Bitcoin. It's it slowly slowly
[51:41] happens but they they are still yeah as
[51:44] with all of Bitcoin all all of the world
[51:46] with Bitcoin they're still early to the
[51:48] game. Um really cool thank you so much
[51:50] uh Yan for for being on the show before
[51:52] I let you go where can people find you
[51:54] ask you questions and and reach out to
[51:56] you? Uh yeah they can find me on
[51:58] Twitter. I'm very active there uh also
[52:00] on LinkedIn and I've started writing a
[52:04] newsletter on Bitcoin research. So you
[52:08] can find also my newsletter on Substack
[52:10] which is called bits of bits of Bitcoin
[52:13] research.
[52:14] Really cool. Thank you so much for for
[52:16] being on and for taking the time. Also,
[52:18] thank you so much for everyone that is
[52:19] watching and listening for joining us
[52:21] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[52:23] with another episode. Bye-bye.
