[00:00] don't die don't get wrecked don't lose
[00:01] everything your savings would be
[00:03] converted into Bitcoin the relationship
[00:06] between states and individuals would
[00:10] change why Bitcoin why does Bitcoin uh
[00:13] matter to you why are you in the space
[00:16] uh not even buying it but also building
[00:19] in the space that's a great question so
[00:22] I think there are I can I can point to a
[00:25] couple
[00:26] of moments or or milest or times I
[00:31] wouldn't say there's just one for me
[00:33] that was you know maybe a single
[00:34] Catalyst for for
[00:36] Bitcoin um you know there was a time
[00:38] that I first bought Bitcoin but that's
[00:41] different to you know the time when I
[00:43] got Bitcoin or the time that I really
[00:46] went down the times that I was really
[00:48] going down the rabbit hole and then
[00:50] there's the time that decided to do it
[00:53] professionally in a sense too I suppose
[00:55] starting with when I really
[00:58] got that for me like many others was in
[01:06] 2020 everyone rememberers 2020 and all
[01:09] this crazy stuff that was going on there
[01:10] and you know I think for
[01:12] me there was a series
[01:15] of confrontations with this fact
[01:19] that
[01:21] um the the
[01:23] world would at least my corner of it at
[01:26] the time being in the United States and
[01:28] having in Australia it was run by really
[01:32] governments of people that weren't
[01:34] representing the people that they
[01:36] purported
[01:38] to
[01:41] and making a number of decisions that
[01:44] not only do I kind of disagree with at
[01:46] the time you know things about lockdowns
[01:48] and responses to co and printing lots of
[01:50] money and all this kind of stuff not
[01:52] only these were decisions that I thought
[01:53] were bad decisions but that there seemed
[01:55] to be um very little recourse uh
[02:01] democratically to solve these problems
[02:03] and also the more that I the more time
[02:06] that I spent thinking about them the
[02:07] more realizing that these were kind of
[02:08] deeply ingrained structural long-term
[02:11] problems with how um these governmental
[02:15] institutions have been allowed to
[02:18] develop and
[02:20] Decline and so while this is all
[02:22] happening obviously um there was a
[02:24] Bitcoin bull market going on too and so
[02:27] kind of coincided nicely with me just
[02:29] tumbling down the Rabbit Hole not only
[02:31] about Bitcoin but also seeing it really
[02:33] as you know I mentioned before uh the
[02:35] lack of recourse to problems I saw in
[02:38] the world seeing it really as
[02:39] potentially that as being the thing that
[02:43] um was a way to
[02:46] counteract a lot of the negative forces
[02:48] that I saw uh going on in the
[02:51] world so that's I guess high level of of
[02:53] kind of like why why Bitcoin and and
[02:56] where I started to get really inspired
[02:57] by it um you know at the time I was um
[03:02] working in Tech um working at a venture
[03:06] capital firm fairly wellknown one in
[03:08] silic Valley and and had been in tech
[03:12] for several years and so I was kind of
[03:14] familiar
[03:15] with I guess the process of of starting
[03:18] tech companies who had done it and was
[03:21] kind of in this me U of of Silicon
[03:22] Valley
[03:23] startups and so then a couple of things
[03:25] happened to me over the course of that
[03:27] year of 2020 and then 2021 were was
[03:30] realizing not only is
[03:32] Bitcoin the kind of the importance of
[03:34] Bitcoin and not only think realizing how
[03:36] important Bitcoin was at a macro level
[03:40] but also deciding that I wanted to
[03:41] commit myself to
[03:43] it professionally full-time maybe for a
[03:47] lifetime as well so so decided that
[03:51] that's what I wanted to do in in a
[03:52] general sense um and then from there it
[03:55] was um some easier to just think about
[03:58] well how can I contribute what types of
[04:00] problems could I solve um and and all of
[04:04] that led me to
[04:05] eventually quitting my job and and
[04:07] starting a company so this is when you
[04:10] started the company with your brother
[04:13] Thomas uh called he Apollo yeah so
[04:16] started Apollo with my brother Thomas
[04:19] and our other co-founder sahill at uh
[04:22] early early last year um in 2022 um and
[04:27] yeah we we started uh
[04:30] company well really because we I guess
[04:33] going to back what I was describing
[04:35] about the process of deciding that we
[04:36] wanted to do this it was asking some
[04:40] really basic questions like what um how
[04:43] can we help Bitcoin how can we help
[04:44] Bitcoin adoption
[04:47] specifically and um many different ways
[04:51] uh I suppose that you could do that but
[04:52] the one that we landed on was helping
[04:54] people to helping to onboard people to
[04:57] to the Bitcoin ecosystem and Network
[04:59] work specifically helping people to uh
[05:03] find out which products to use to
[05:05] compare Bitcoin products and services um
[05:09] uh to find out what to trust and why um
[05:12] and and in that way help people get
[05:16] onboarded to the
[05:18] network so Apollo is a platform where
[05:22] you can see reviews from uh Bitcoin
[05:24] products and services can you also buy
[05:26] Bitcoin directly in the
[05:28] platform no we're not we're not an
[05:30] exchange um it really is just focused on
[05:33] on the products so um exchanges for sure
[05:37] uh Hardware wallets nodes um all
[05:41] different kinds of products and
[05:42] financial services too um really it's a
[05:44] place for people to discover them to
[05:46] compare them to read about the
[05:49] experiences that that other bitcoiners
[05:50] have had with them and then figure out
[05:53] what's right for
[05:55] them interesting is it just Bitcoin
[05:57] products or is it uh in the long-term
[06:00] plan with other products too it's
[06:02] outside of the Bitcoin
[06:05] ecosystem yeah that's an interesting
[06:07] question um you know so it's it's
[06:10] Bitcoin products today you know but of
[06:13] course the vision that we have not only
[06:16] for I suppose the world of Bitcoin
[06:19] products but also Bitcoin more generally
[06:21] is that Bitcoin is really going to eat
[06:23] up and
[06:25] subsume so many other adjacent product
[06:28] and service C
[06:31] ories which will over time perhaps in a
[06:34] not too distant future will become
[06:37] Bitcoin categories themselves by way of
[06:41] example you know you can already see
[06:43] this somewhat but you know in five years
[06:45] time there will be Bitcoin life
[06:48] insurance products there will be Bitcoin
[06:50] mortgages there will be Bitcoin um all
[06:53] different kinds of credit products
[06:54] related to bitcoin so really what we see
[06:56] this is Bitcoin products and services is
[06:59] a niche today um but eventually all
[07:04] Bitcoin all companies will be Bitcoin
[07:06] companies um and everybody will have a
[07:09] Bitcoin offering or a Bitcoin related
[07:11] offering um and so
[07:13] Bitcoin because it's going to become and
[07:16] is becoming Global money um it's a kind
[07:19] of thin end of the
[07:21] wedge into as I said not just what look
[07:24] like Bitcoin products today being you
[07:26] know wallets and exchanges but
[07:28] eventually um many other things
[07:30] too this brings me to your X profile at
[07:34] the moment I saw that you call yourself
[07:36] a Bitcoin
[07:37] accelerationist and is building a
[07:40] company uh and doing um more than just
[07:44] buying meaning that you're Bitcoin
[07:46] accelerist accelerist or is what is the
[07:49] meaning of of that and why are you
[07:51] calling yourself
[07:52] that it's a good question so um you know
[07:56] this is something that I've been
[07:57] thinking about recently and and
[08:00] developing some thoughts on and I
[08:03] wouldn't say that I have a final answer
[08:04] honestly but um there is an ongoing
[08:08] discussion right
[08:10] now um not so much in the Bitcoin World
[08:13] more in the tech World about what it
[08:14] means
[08:15] to this kind of mean War really going on
[08:19] between people calling themselves
[08:20] accelerationists and and and kind of
[08:23] casting their opponents as
[08:25] desists uh in particularly see this in
[08:27] the world of AI you on the one hand you
[08:29] have a bunch of people who want to or
[08:32] who have I suppose concerns or cautions
[08:34] or fears about the development of
[08:36] artificial
[08:37] intelligence um and who maybe want to
[08:39] slow it down and then in the other Camp
[08:41] you have um your
[08:44] accelerators uh and there's this kind
[08:46] movement called you know I don't know
[08:48] you may be familiar with
[08:50] it call effective accelerationism and
[08:53] you basically you got a bunch of AI
[08:54] people who are kind of mically joining
[08:56] forces and and are proponents of
[08:59] just going really fast um and building
[09:02] really fast in the realm of
[09:05] AI in addition to that there have been
[09:07] some kind of interesting offshoots or or
[09:09] Forks of some of those ideas
[09:13] into I guess other domains and other
[09:16] fields too um and and Bitcoin is one of
[09:20] them and I think you know so what does
[09:22] it mean to be an acceleration with
[09:25] respect to
[09:27] bitcoin it's it's a it's a long
[09:29] complicated um question I guess my early
[09:33] thoughts on it
[09:34] are that it's a useful frame to tease
[09:39] apart some
[09:41] important perhaps underd discussed
[09:44] issues in Bitcoin um and in particular
[09:47] the you know how people see the either
[09:51] natural or inevitable or probable course
[09:54] of Bitcoin
[09:55] adoption
[09:57] going I guess to be more
[10:00] specific you know there's one let's say
[10:02] broadly defined there's like an
[10:05] accelerated maximum like maximal speed
[10:08] version of Bitcoin ad option where we
[10:09] just say like Bitcoin more Bitcoin usage
[10:12] full stop is good for Bitcoin we want
[10:14] more people using Bitcoin in whatever
[10:17] way they want to and let's just get as
[10:20] many people to join the network as fast
[10:23] as they can in any
[10:25] capacity and this is it might sound like
[10:27] a bit of a straw man and I'm not
[10:28] necessarily saying that people hold
[10:30] these specific views but like this is
[10:32] just one way that you could I guess
[10:33] divide the world so that's maybe an
[10:36] acceleration point of view and on the
[10:38] other hand yeah
[10:40] so so yeah well how does that sound you
[10:42] tell
[10:43] me it sounds great the one question that
[10:46] just came up in in my head is like there
[10:50] is always a debate going on if hodling
[10:53] and uh just spending the fear and the
[10:57] the fear that is overlapping in your
[11:00] income just getting that into Bitcoin
[11:03] and but spending the the fear or is
[11:06] spending replace like do you have to
[11:08] fire up the Bitcoin circular economy um
[11:12] or it's just hling on the best place
[11:16] it's for me it's an interesting question
[11:18] because uh in some countries you have to
[11:21] deal with taxes if you spend the Bitcoin
[11:24] you have to deal with a lot of uh other
[11:27] stuff and how do you see that in
[11:31] accelerating the Bitcoin adoption can we
[11:33] have an an accelerate Bitcoin adoption
[11:35] if most just hold them is holding
[11:39] Bitcoin using
[11:41] them that's a that's a good question I'm
[11:44] not sure that it you know immediately
[11:47] does it does it neatly fall along
[11:49] accelerationist
[11:51] lines I'm not sure I mean I can
[11:54] certainly see the argument that the more
[11:59] the more circular economy type activity
[12:01] that there
[12:03] is I suppose it's
[12:06] um maybe furthering proofs of concept of
[12:10] what a hyper Bitcoin a future could look
[12:13] like and so in that sense maybe it is it
[12:15] is a bit of a you know a vision of an
[12:18] accelerated future but I suppose you
[12:21] know perhaps equally I I would say that
[12:23] just buying and spending Bitcoin it's
[12:26] not clear to me what the actual spending
[12:29] of it or even if it's spend you know
[12:31] spending in replaces it's not clear to
[12:32] me what that necessarily adds in a macro
[12:37] big picture sense to bitcoin adoption
[12:41] right you can have a whole bunch of
[12:42] pockets of circular economies and that's
[12:44] wonderful and perhaps wonderful for the
[12:45] people in them um but if they are
[12:48] isolated uh even if they're well
[12:51] functioning ones that's perhaps somewhat
[12:52] different from as I said like a big
[12:55] picture uh progress of Bitcoin I'm not
[12:59] sure I mean it it goes also back to the
[13:02] the stages of money we know that we not
[13:05] just like you cannot just create money
[13:07] and be immediately unit of account IMM
[13:09] of exchange the first money has to um in
[13:14] my opinion prove itself as a store of
[13:17] value and if it's then a store of value
[13:19] and people trust it and people believe
[13:22] in the value uh then it can slowly uh
[13:26] start as a med of exchange because
[13:28] people are having it and they want to
[13:30] exchange it because so many people have
[13:32] it and then when all the people are
[13:35] exchanging it then it's slowly gets a
[13:37] unitive account and I I still I just
[13:39] think we are now in the store value
[13:41] phase uh because just
[13:44] like
[13:45] yeah I very much agree you know I think
[13:48] I think this is perhaps more of a
[13:49] question of what what is the definition
[13:51] what is a definition of success for
[13:54] Bitcoin how many different properties of
[13:57] money does it have to be
[13:59] fulfilling for I suppose the mission of
[14:02] Bitcoin to be achieved you know if it's
[14:05] never anything more than a store of
[14:07] value you know like a digital gold this
[14:09] is question but would that be a success
[14:12] or would it be a failure or or does
[14:14] Bitcoin have to be a medium of exchange
[14:17] you know I think if you ask perhaps if
[14:19] you ask Michael sailor I think he would
[14:21] perhaps say something to put words in
[14:23] his mouth but the Sailor point of view
[14:26] Pro I think would be that coin is is
[14:29] property um and you know it's the best
[14:33] property in the world it's the best
[14:35] store of value in the world and and it
[14:37] and we don't have to have it scale as a
[14:40] medium exchange for eight billion people
[14:42] for it to succeed on the other hand if
[14:45] you were to ask uh uh the Bitcoin cash
[14:48] crowd or um uh you know other people
[14:53] like them they would say no um Bitcoin
[14:56] is supposed to be PE Top Cat and and if
[14:58] it's not that it's
[15:00] failed so yeah so this this I guess is
[15:02] is is kind of gets to the heart of of
[15:05] what Bitcoin is supposed to do and what
[15:08] is the mission of Bitcoin if there is
[15:09] one when you look at let's say the year
[15:13] 2050 and you would now say oh this has
[15:17] to happen for Bitcoin in order that I
[15:21] say in 2050 oh it was a success like
[15:23] what what metrics has Bitcoin to hit
[15:27] what like what Happ to happen in 2050
[15:30] for you to say when you then in 2050 oh
[15:35] Bitcoin actually was a success over the
[15:37] last let's say 25 years uh in your
[15:41] opinion how does that look
[15:44] like I
[15:47] think I agree with you about the stages
[15:50] of money and that's that perhaps store
[15:52] of value
[15:54] precedes medium of exchange and so
[15:57] thinking along those lines I would say
[16:00] um there are certain Milestones that we
[16:02] would want to see Bitcoin hit perhaps in
[16:05] a certain order so becoming the
[16:08] preeminent Global store of monetary
[16:11] value would be one of them really
[16:14] overtake and replace gold for example um
[16:19] that would be a surprise to me but I
[16:20] think it would be something with you
[16:21] know I would expect that to
[16:23] happen so so that would be one I think
[16:26] you know okay so what's the current
[16:27] market cap of
[16:30] um if Bitcoin reached it I think that
[16:32] would imply a price of around 700k now
[16:36] obviously that doesn't take into account
[16:38] a lot of that monetary energy actually
[16:40] trans I don't know price targets are
[16:41] hard but certainly north of a million
[16:43] dollars of coin
[16:45] um but but yeah aside from just the
[16:48] number I would say you know what what
[16:50] role is it play in society replacing
[16:52] gold would be one and there are many
[16:54] other stores of value too that I think
[16:56] many people in Bitcoin would agree the
[16:58] the monetary en energy of which should
[17:02] go to
[17:04] bitcoin but but you seeing Fiat still be
[17:07] around in
[17:10] 2050 I I think so yeah I do predictions
[17:14] are hard but I I don't
[17:18] think 2050 is not that far away really
[17:22] 20150 is about as far away as as the
[17:24] year 2000 is from today and um it's it's
[17:28] very very hard to
[17:31] imagine everything you know fiat-based
[17:35] monetary Financial systems being
[17:38] wholesale replaced by by Bitcoin that's
[17:42] even if Bitcoin is capable as a network
[17:45] with different layers of of handling the
[17:49] applications that the Fiat Financial
[17:51] system performs today which I'm not sure
[17:54] if it can but even if it could I think
[17:56] you know I'm I'm just not sure like that
[17:59] would be so radical and so crazy so I
[18:02] say I wouldn't say that it's a failure
[18:05] condition of Bitcoin if
[18:08] Fiat Fiat economies still exist in 50
[18:11] years now or 25 years now do I think
[18:14] that they will be the Fiat currencies
[18:16] that exist today probably not um many of
[18:19] them will die and probably die within
[18:21] the next 10 years but you know Fiat
[18:24] currencies aren't hard to create so so
[18:27] uh Fiat in general as a thing as a as a
[18:30] phenomenon will still exist individual
[18:33] Fiat currencies will almost certainly
[18:37] die
[18:39] interesting so this uh so for you uh
[18:43] it's more about the store of value and
[18:46] you have more questions about the the
[18:49] medium of exchange
[18:51] still yeah I suppose my my questions
[18:54] about media of exchange on two levels
[18:56] one is one is
[18:59] um as I said the
[19:02] the there's a question there's a
[19:04] technical question of is Bitcoin
[19:09] technically capable of scaling to 8
[19:12] billion people as a medium exchange or
[19:15] even a meaningful subset of them which
[19:18] today I think the answer is no I think
[19:19] that's fairly
[19:20] uncontroversial but then the secondary
[19:22] the secondary question is you know does
[19:25] it have to is that necessary for Bitcoin
[19:27] to to succeed in some sense so what does
[19:30] succeed mean again there are different
[19:32] definitions but you know if Bitcoin can
[19:36] act as
[19:37] a um a real disciplinary constraint on
[19:42] the excesses of
[19:44] Fiat even if it
[19:47] isn't you know a global medium of
[19:50] exchange would we say that Bitcoin
[19:52] succeeds under those
[19:54] circumstances I'm not I'm not sure but
[19:56] but maybe
[20:00] interesting um this maybe gets also in a
[20:04] a different topic of
[20:07] mine can there be anything that stops
[20:10] Bitcoin at that moment like is there any
[20:14] um event or player or something that
[20:18] happens that can stop Bitcoin I'm 100%
[20:22] sure that there is something that can um
[20:25] slow down the adoption or accelerate the
[20:27] adoption
[20:28] that's for sure but is there anything
[20:30] still in your opinion that can stop
[20:33] Bitcoin at that moment at the moment of
[20:36] like at some later date or today like
[20:39] just thinking about the world as it
[20:40] exist like right now like yeah for me in
[20:44] 2050 if we are the if Bitcoin is the um
[20:49] biggest and most valuable asset which it
[20:52] would be if it would take over gold uh
[20:55] because gold is right now the one uh
[20:57] then for me me in 2050 it's just not
[21:00] even possible like this I think it's not
[21:02] controversial to say in 2050 it's it's
[21:04] not being stopped it's just like keeps
[21:07] accumulating um but we're in an earlier
[21:09] stage uh I don't think there is anything
[21:12] but I always curious what other
[21:16] bitcoiners have to say and some have
[21:18] some concerns in some areas yeah um
[21:23] definitely definitely Bitcoin can be can
[21:25] be stopped I think uh Bitcoin is not
[21:28] inevitable um it's a useful mean to
[21:30] propagate on on X and and other
[21:33] platforms but Bitcoin can be stopped for
[21:35] sure you know and my I guess particular
[21:39] focus is with Apollo directed at what I
[21:43] see as one of the big uh vulnerabilities
[21:45] of Bitcoin and it's a social one you
[21:48] know my view Bitcoin adoption is
[21:53] succeeding because people increasingly
[21:55] trust it that's why people buy it and
[21:57] that's why people hold it
[21:59] there are you know trust is uh fragile
[22:04] and ephemeral and can be abused and can
[22:07] be broken um and and that is so with
[22:11] individual people but it is also the
[22:12] case
[22:14] with new technologies that seek to
[22:17] replace incumbent Technologies
[22:19] particularly revolutionary ones you know
[22:22] my um by way of I suppose historical
[22:26] analogy you know I like to think about
[22:29] nuclear
[22:30] power you know in in much the same way
[22:33] that Bitcoin is we would say already the
[22:36] best monetary
[22:37] Network in the world perhaps PL is
[22:40] already the best money in in the world
[22:42] certainly the best store of value
[22:43] nuclear power is in any ways the best uh
[22:46] best form of
[22:49] energy but why is it the case that we
[22:52] aren't all you know that
[22:54] every uh every city in the world world
[22:58] is running on nuclear power
[23:00] well I mean it's a somewhat rhetorical
[23:03] question but my analysis of it is it's a
[23:05] trust problem right when was Chernobyl
[23:08] Chernobyl the Chernobyl disaster was
[23:09] like 1986 or something what it's like 40
[23:14] years later you know and and it's true
[23:17] you nuclear nuclear power is the best
[23:20] power today it was also true 40 years
[23:22] ago right but what happens is there's a
[23:25] massive um there's a massive Trust
[23:28] breaking incident and then the
[23:31] technology really has been in the
[23:33] wilderness for 40 years since you know
[23:37] you have people to this day who in my
[23:41] view wrongly but they're very concerned
[23:42] about dangers of nuclear power and so on
[23:44] and so forth and so what does this have
[23:46] to do with Bitcoin Bitcoin is a superior
[23:48] monetary asset and network
[23:51] today but there's no reason I can see
[23:55] why it couldn't also spend 40 years in
[23:57] the Wilderness if nobody trusts it
[24:00] Network itself and and and more to do
[24:03] with harder to manage social events
[24:07] around us you know when I um about a
[24:12] year ago I was uh uh I was talking to a
[24:15] family member a distant family member
[24:18] about um about FTX of all things you
[24:22] know and this is someone who you know
[24:23] I'd met them at like family Christmas
[24:25] event and they said to me um you know so
[24:28] what do you do what are you working on I
[24:30] said I'm working on
[24:31] bitcoin um and they said oh yeah Bitcoin
[24:34] that's um that's that FTX thing right
[24:38] Bitcoin Sam bman freed you know it's all
[24:40] kind of the same thing to them you know
[24:42] and that was that was a a fairly
[24:46] dispiriting uh moment for me because I
[24:48] realized that like at the level of kind
[24:50] of norming land you know millions of
[24:54] people in America and around the world
[24:56] that was probably also the case for them
[24:58] right Bitcoin equals FTX equals sand
[25:00] bankman
[25:02] freed and I was wondering you know I
[25:04] immediately thought like how long is it
[25:05] going to take how long is it going to
[25:06] take to regain that level of regain the
[25:10] trust you know kind of climb out of that
[25:14] hole um and not only that but how many
[25:18] shots do we have at that whe like what
[25:21] if there's another FTX what if there are
[25:25] two more ftxs right like
[25:28] would people just kind of write Bitcoin
[25:31] off at least for a significant amount of
[25:33] time in significant numbers
[25:36] so so that's my biggest concern I would
[25:40] say with Bitcoin is that we need to
[25:43] get Everyday People to uh to trust this
[25:47] to adopt this and to not you know we
[25:51] can't run the risk again really of
[25:53] letting there be another FDX that just
[25:56] is like the Chernobyl moment for Bitcoin
[25:59] I mean for me it all comes back to
[26:01] education and I also think that that's
[26:04] the the reason why Bitcoin adoption is
[26:08] not
[26:09] like a lot of bitcoiners say that and I
[26:12] also have the experience once I got it I
[26:14] was having a lot of fomo because I
[26:17] thought oh I'm not that intelligent uh
[26:20] other people will also figured it out
[26:22] that this is the as you said the best
[26:24] monetary system we have so it will just
[26:27] adopt tomorrow at 100% but it is not
[26:30] like that because uh although we have a
[26:33] digital Global globalized World our
[26:36] brains did not got an upgrade and we
[26:38] still need a lot of time to process
[26:40] things and we need time to make the
[26:44] change I heard Bitcoin first time in
[26:47] 2017 uh and bought it first in 2020 like
[26:51] I needed three years and I and I was
[26:53] really 100% convinced and I discussed it
[26:57] with other people that Bitcoin is [ __ ]
[26:59] in 2020 I discovered that Bitcoin uh uh
[27:03] is not [ __ ] and the interesting part is
[27:06] um I ran out of arguments against other
[27:10] people that talked me talked about with
[27:12] me uh on the topic of Bitcoin and then I
[27:16] was like okay this weekend I will sit
[27:18] down and say to myself I will openly uh
[27:23] search for Bitcoin reasons to fail and
[27:28] and in that search on that weekend I
[27:31] discovered that Bitcoin is actually not
[27:32] that bad uh and for me it all comes down
[27:36] for Education because also as you said
[27:38] FDX if you're really educated you know
[27:41] FDX is a company and has uh not directly
[27:45] a connection to bitcoin of course in the
[27:49] like of course they are dealing with
[27:51] Bitcoin they're dealing with other
[27:52] cryptos also they exchange um so there
[27:55] is a connection obviously to bit Bitcoin
[27:58] uh but it has nothing to do with the
[28:00] Bitcoin protocol itself it has to do
[28:03] with like a small thing in the whole EOS
[28:05] system but other people that uh didn't
[28:08] do the homor in education wise that
[28:11] they're just living their life and not
[28:14] bothering with uh deep deep
[28:17] understanding Bitcoin they don't see it
[28:19] that way and that's understandable that
[28:21] they don't see that that way uh but it
[28:23] all comes down to trust and trust is
[28:26] gained if you spend time with it and
[28:29] spend a lot of education on it and I
[28:31] think number go up technology is
[28:33] bringing them back in all the time but
[28:37] yeah it's it's it's the one thing that
[28:40] money Needs Trust and you're completely
[28:43] right if Bitcoin fails to have trust of
[28:47] a global scale it will fail completely
[28:52] and in order like this
[28:56] uh to put it in a question um for a
[29:00] normal PL uh for a normal person that uh
[29:04] is just having Bitcoin right now and is
[29:07] is is like LS the technology and is
[29:10] completely into the Bitcoin adoption and
[29:14] what can they do to increase that
[29:16] adoption and avoid an FDX because like
[29:20] there will be companies built and they
[29:23] will fail eventually uh in the Bitcoin
[29:26] sphere we have the first one with Mount
[29:28] GX and now we have FDX we have Celsius
[29:31] and I think there will be at least five
[29:34] more cases or 10 maybe 100 cases I don't
[29:36] know uh let's see how big the scale of
[29:39] them are because the SSE and so on
[29:42] cracks them down but what can a normal
[29:44] blab do to increase the adoption and
[29:46] increase the Trust In
[29:49] Bitcoin many things but immediately what
[29:53] I think is most important is protecting
[29:56] against the biggest risk risks right
[29:58] like don't die don't get wreck don't
[30:01] lose everything you know um if you on
[30:05] board someone to bitcoin and you
[30:06] convince them to buy at the top of a
[30:08] cycle and then the price goes down then
[30:11] yeah their trust is going to be harmed
[30:14] but at least they'll have their coins
[30:16] right um they'll still have their
[30:18] SATs and so perhaps the trust
[30:21] is
[30:23] recoverable but if someone gets rugged
[30:25] you know someone loses their savings if
[30:27] someone gets scammed stolen from lied to
[30:30] cheated then that's the that's the real
[30:33] big risk so I would say what can people
[30:35] do is at least make sure that when you
[30:39] are orange peeling
[30:42] onboarding Shilling whatever products
[30:45] and services uh you you want to um
[30:50] minimize that risk for people for for
[30:53] your family and friends um you you know
[30:56] send them to the the right the right
[30:58] trustworthy exchangers get them to use
[31:00] the best custody services and
[31:03] providers
[31:05] um don't obviously overpromise right uh
[31:09] don't tell someone uh don't tell your
[31:12] your uncle that he's going to retire in
[31:15] two months time um and get suit of Rich
[31:18] overnight um but most importantly don't
[31:21] you know just make sure that nobody gets
[31:24] taken down a really bad path of um
[31:27] getting wrecked and and winding up in
[31:29] the hands of of of scammers and thieves
[31:32] that would be my biggest piece of advice
[31:35] and you and your brother and who was the
[31:39] other uh the third one founded the yeah
[31:44] um you founded the company on a Bitcoin
[31:48] only standard basically like you focused
[31:52] solely on bitcoin is it right yeah yeah
[31:56] um
[31:57] how did you discover Bitcoin only like
[32:00] how did you had some uh altcoin
[32:03] shitcoins as as we we call them uh did
[32:07] you consider making that platform open
[32:10] for other cryptos why hyperfocusing on
[32:13] bitcoin why does this make sense for you
[32:16] we never considered it for the company
[32:18] no
[32:20] um you know well so so there's there's a
[32:23] I guess there's one question which is
[32:24] what does it mean to be Bitcoin only
[32:26] particularly context you know and it's
[32:28] it it isn't necessarily black and white
[32:31] because you know we are an index I
[32:33] suppose of um products and services that
[32:37] companies that have Bitcoin products and
[32:39] services so there are companies that
[32:42] have a Bitcoin product that also have
[32:45] altcoin products coinbase for example so
[32:48] coinbase is listed on a pileo and people
[32:50] can review it and learn about it um but
[32:53] for us the relevant distinction to make
[32:55] is um is the big coin part so if you if
[32:58] you have a Bitcoin offering and you're
[33:00] not obviously um like that's there are
[33:02] other qualifying factors too but that's
[33:05] how we make the distinction if you don't
[33:08] have any Bitcoin offering then you're
[33:10] just not relevant for a
[33:12] PO so that that's kind of how we think
[33:15] about Bitcoin versus other stuff um why
[33:19] not include other cryptocurrencies well
[33:23] I mean it's for much the
[33:25] same it's it's not purely ideological
[33:28] it's not because we're just laser mates
[33:32] but it's because when you're building
[33:33] you know when you're building a company
[33:34] you're trying to build something that
[33:35] will stand the test of
[33:37] time and the the I think the objective
[33:41] fact is that altcoins don't you can you
[33:45] can gamble on them sure but um they
[33:47] don't stand a test of time so if we
[33:49] think
[33:49] about what's going to be around in 10
[33:52] years or longer it's going to be Bitcoin
[33:55] and so the choice really is obvious for
[33:56] us why would we predicate our company on
[34:00] a bunch of junk that is um that's going
[34:03] to flame out within you know within one
[34:05] cycle uh it just doesn't make
[34:09] sense it all goes back to to to trust
[34:12] and actual
[34:15] decentralization and uh thinking of is
[34:18] an Alco even actually decentralized when
[34:22] for example at ethereum there can be a
[34:24] roll back of an transaction
[34:27] uh that can basically complete overhaul
[34:30] of the whole system from proof of work
[34:32] to proof of stake I don't know if that's
[34:34] actually that decentralized and if if
[34:37] the use cases of a video game character
[34:39] is maybe better off in a centralized
[34:42] database more effective I don't know but
[34:45] let's let's see how it plays up I'm just
[34:47] like I'm I did some uh altcoins I did
[34:50] ethereum I did uh some really small
[34:53] shitcoins also uh but in 2021 uh I was
[34:58] going all in only in Bitcoin I was
[35:01] completely uh as you said lasa Maxi I
[35:05] was completely only in Bitcoin then and
[35:09] uh it it it turned out really great so
[35:12] far and I think Bitcoin is
[35:16] definitely uh the the only winner I
[35:19] think in the long run in that game but
[35:22] let's see the time will tell how how
[35:25] will how we will continue that way and I
[35:29] have watched one uh podcast of you and
[35:33] your brother discussing about the
[35:34] sovereign
[35:36] individual and I would I will not open
[35:40] that whole book now
[35:44] because completely other topic but what
[35:47] for you is it meaning to be in sovereign
[35:51] individual uh and what does it mean to
[35:54] be a sov individual maybe even outside
[35:56] of of Bitcoin like what is it meaning
[35:58] why do we need Bitcoin to be a sovereign
[36:00] individual but also what elements are
[36:03] outside of Bitcoin to be in s
[36:06] individual Jo so I think I think you're
[36:09] right we can't um summarize the entire
[36:11] book here um but maybe it's worth just
[36:14] discussing high level themes some of
[36:17] them the overarching themes um and so as
[36:21] supposed from my point of view how would
[36:23] I describe it I would say the sovereign
[36:24] individual for those of you who don't
[36:26] know book uh history book of sorts
[36:30] written in the mid to late '90s
[36:33] uh by a couple of guys uh
[36:37] who their area of study is is I think as
[36:40] they describe it Mega political Trends
[36:43] me like macro historical trends that
[36:45] occur on the scale of not uh decades but
[36:50] uh hundreds of years maybe even
[36:51] thousands of years um and so the the
[36:54] book is written with that frame in mind
[36:58] and in
[37:00] particular uh I suppose
[37:03] forecasting predicting or or or even
[37:06] describing that
[37:08] um Society then in the 90s and pretty
[37:11] much the same case now is on the cusp of
[37:14] one of these big Mega political trends
[37:16] of kind of an Epoch
[37:18] changing um uh Paradigm shifting
[37:22] movement and that movement is as they
[37:25] describe it from the the the world of
[37:29] nation states as they exist today um out
[37:33] of that um and that certainly in the 90s
[37:36] which was I suppose the the perhaps the
[37:38] the Pico top um of nation state
[37:41] dominance um you have you know the
[37:43] United States was lead of the Free World
[37:45] many other Western Nations where where
[37:47] their their dominance is uh so complete
[37:51] not only Over The World At Large but
[37:53] within their geographical boundaries you
[37:56] have the State as such that is
[37:58] completely coterminous with the nation
[38:01] um these governments that control every
[38:03] aspect of your life as a citizen um
[38:06] there's no escape from taxation or
[38:08] regulation or or anything like that
[38:10] whether you like that or you don't and
[38:12] so the book what the book forecasts is
[38:15] um a decline of these nation states for
[38:18] for various
[38:21] reasons broadly though the reason is was
[38:25] that we were on the on the um on the
[38:27] verge of entering the information age
[38:29] right the internet particularly in 1996
[38:32] um was was just growing perhaps at a
[38:34] similar stage of adoption to what
[38:36] Bitcoin is today and so these they saw
[38:38] the internet as being this kind of great
[38:40] um unraveling force of the power of
[38:42] nation states and that increasingly as
[38:44] people move out of the physical world
[38:46] and into the Digital World um they live
[38:48] more of their lives online and they kind
[38:50] of increasingly escape the reaches of of
[38:54] nation states who who who
[38:58] persist quite explicitly as set out in
[39:01] the book through the uh through the
[39:05] exaction of violence or the threat of
[39:08] violence to um tax citizens and to kind
[39:11] of force their compliance to every type
[39:14] of law that they have so what is what is
[39:17] what is being a sovereign individual a
[39:19] sovereign individual as the book
[39:21] describes is somebody who is undergoing
[39:24] this journey of transformation to a kind
[39:26] of from the citizen of a Nation to citiz
[39:29] to a citiz to a citizen of the web
[39:33] you're kind of an online
[39:35] citizen um who you know not only can you
[39:38] kind of um project yourself digitally
[39:42] and connect with other people through
[39:44] the internet but as which interestingly
[39:47] kind of forecast in the book that
[39:48] perhaps your wealth your savings would
[39:51] be converted into digital currencies
[39:54] this is a prediction there's
[39:57] 1996 um
[39:59] prly anticipating
[40:02] Bitcoin anyway all what does all this
[40:04] mean I suppose um so a sovereign
[40:06] individual is um I I believe that we are
[40:10] seeing people today who are more and
[40:13] more living the lives of they're either
[40:16] living the lives of sovereign
[40:18] individuals or they are attempting to or
[40:23] perhaps they are realizing that that is
[40:25] a path
[40:27] for them it's a viable path you know
[40:31] taxation exploitation I think is
[40:34] becoming more and more onerous
[40:35] particularly for the more most
[40:37] productive members of Western societies
[40:40] you know I live in California uh and you
[40:44] know it's I think something like 20% of
[40:50] the people in California pay like an
[40:53] astoundingly high proportion of all the
[40:56] you know in of tax revenues of the state
[40:58] here and I think that disproportionate
[41:01] representation is only going to be
[41:03] exacerbated going forward um and so you
[41:07] know taxes are going to go up if you got
[41:09] a lot of money and and that's why people
[41:10] are fleeing the state anyway not to get
[41:12] sidetracked on California but um so
[41:15] Sovereign individualism is is people
[41:18] who I would say are coming to this
[41:22] realization
[41:24] that nation states are
[41:27] declining and that there are um perhaps
[41:32] alternate paths for people to pursue
[41:37] to expand their own sovereignty in in
[41:41] ways that that they weren't raised to
[41:44] believe were possible or or
[41:47] existed so this will when we spin this
[41:52] uh thought more in the future with
[41:55] Bitcoin uh an a fundamental layer for
[41:58] money uh with internet with
[42:01] communication that cannot be stopped and
[42:03] people are living more and more in the
[42:06] in the web as you said and then can they
[42:09] can work from everywhere like home
[42:10] office and stuff like that um how will
[42:13] this change the political situation when
[42:17] governments basically have to con like
[42:20] has to compete with one another that
[42:23] they citizens live in their there is and
[42:27] have to basically have to have an
[42:29] attractive place for people to stay how
[42:32] will this change the whole political
[42:34] game in the let let's say next 20 years
[42:37] for you yeah well I think in the
[42:40] language of the sovereign individual
[42:41] book they would say that the
[42:44] relationship between states and
[42:46] individuals will change from one of a
[42:49] kind of um you know Master servant
[42:52] relationship to a kind of uh client
[42:55] relationship where States actually have
[42:58] to as you say compete to serve their
[43:03] constituents and their
[43:05] citizens you know if it's if if let's
[43:07] say it's trivial easy for you to
[43:11] acquire two or three more passports
[43:14] right from other kind of startup or
[43:16] Forward Thinking Nations who want you to
[43:19] go and live and work there because you
[43:21] are a productive
[43:24] person and if it's also triv really easy
[43:26] for you to take your wealth with you
[43:28] because it's in an unconfiscatable form
[43:30] I.E
[43:31] Bitcoin then what's going to happen you
[43:33] know I don't know where you live but
[43:35] what you know where you
[43:37] live let's say you
[43:39] live for example sake in the United
[43:44] States well what choice does your
[43:48] government have other than to make it
[43:51] more attractive for you to try
[43:53] and well there are two ways I suppose
[43:56] you they can either increase the
[43:58] incentives to stay or they can increase
[44:01] the disincentives to
[44:04] leave so that's I guess that's how you
[44:07] could think about your your your country
[44:09] of origin right um dis what does a
[44:12] disincentive to leave looks like well we
[44:14] already we actually already have that in
[44:15] the United States like there is an exit
[44:17] tax if you want to leave the United
[44:18] States um and go somewhere else you are
[44:22] still subject to the taxation regime of
[44:24] the United States and if you really exit
[44:26] there's like a straightforward tax on
[44:28] all of your wealth above a certain
[44:29] threshold I think it's like $2
[44:31] million so um so this disincentive is if
[44:35] you try and leave we will take your
[44:36] money now Bitcoin makes that harder but
[44:40] um you know I still wouldn't want to be
[44:43] on the wrong side of the United States
[44:44] government if it came to that of course
[44:47] you can also you you know that's the
[44:49] kind of stick there's also the carrot
[44:51] right what does a carrot look like it
[44:52] looks like hey we'll lower your taxes we
[44:55] will give you freedoms that you don't
[44:58] have today but maybe you would like to
[44:59] have um and that's I guess country of
[45:02] origin now on the country of destination
[45:06] um I think we're already seeing lots of
[45:07] interesting things happen there you know
[45:10] El Salvador is you know in the process
[45:13] of developing new regimes to to
[45:16] attract Tech Talent people in general um
[45:20] opening up their kind of passport for a
[45:21] certain amount of investment I think
[45:24] today in Salvador it's like a million
[45:25] bucks
[45:26] um but you know my prediction is it's
[45:28] going to be a lot less than that in 10
[45:30] years time you know and why do I say
[45:32] that because today there's one El
[45:34] Salvador in 10 years time there will be
[45:36] 30 El Salvador right and they will all
[45:39] be doing the same thing they will be
[45:40] competing for the best wealthiest most
[45:44] productive most pro-social Talent on
[45:47] Earth who will be able to pack up and
[45:51] leave and take their wealth and families
[45:54] with them and so so you're going to see
[45:57] I suppose a great increase in the
[46:00] competition and these these kind of
[46:02] there's going to be a market basically
[46:04] for citizens in other words it's going
[46:06] to be a um right now you have a a a
[46:10] a sellers Market the right put it in
[46:15] like real estate terms you have a seller
[46:17] of government services and it's really a
[46:19] sellers Market there's nothing you can
[46:20] do more or less like for most people in
[46:22] the world you take whatever you know you
[46:24] have a monopolist on your doorstep
[46:26] there's nothing you can do but the world
[46:28] is moving to a buyers Market buyers of
[46:31] government services right you're going
[46:33] to have many to choose from many places
[46:35] to go um and the balance of power is
[46:39] going to shift
[46:42] dramatically a kind of beautiful future
[46:45] if um if we are thinking about that
[46:49] absolutely there's there's one more
[46:51] thing I would like to ask you I also
[46:53] heard it on a podcast of yours um you
[46:56] are you were talking about a future post
[47:01] ads and this is something I hear more
[47:04] and more in the Bitcoin sphere about
[47:07] value for Value like you provide some
[47:10] value uh for example I have this podcast
[47:13] and people can via fountain or via any
[47:17] other app uh stream Sates to me or just
[47:22] send Sates to me and this is a quite
[47:26] amazing or even X tries to do that with
[47:29] uh you have to pay for Twitter plue and
[47:32] uh or YouTube premium is also that like
[47:35] you pay for YouTube premium and the
[47:37] content creators that are monetized
[47:38] getting a certain amount of that it's
[47:41] it's in the Fiat world but it's based on
[47:43] the same principle I would say um why do
[47:47] you think we have an post add error like
[47:50] do you think that there will not be any
[47:52] paid advertisement or will it look
[47:55] different like like what's your take on
[47:56] value for value and the post add
[48:00] future well I'm certainly not an expert
[48:02] on this
[48:03] stuff
[48:05] and as much as I do I I think value for
[48:08] value is very interesting and and
[48:10] certainly on an individual level you
[48:12] know any content creators who who are
[48:16] making it
[48:19] work I'm not totally convinced that
[48:22] value for Value as it is thought of and
[48:26] as it exists today could really replace
[48:29] advertising as such the thing about ads
[48:32] is people don't like them but they work
[48:35] they actually work really well you know
[48:38] in some specific ways like there's very
[48:40] little friction you know if they're if
[48:43] they're placed well you know you don't
[48:45] have to make any decisions as as a um as
[48:48] a consumer of content um there's no kind
[48:52] of switching costs between different
[48:56] experiences you know a well placed and a
[49:00] well crafted ad I I think they'll always
[49:03] be a place for that online because there
[49:06] are yeah the the idea you know there
[49:08] have been many examples of people trying
[49:11] to rethink pay walls for example pay
[49:15] walls for news sites and articles you
[49:17] know and and I'm not saying it can't
[49:19] work but they they really haven't worked
[49:20] so far and it's CU it's it's actually
[49:22] tough it's tough to to make this kind of
[49:24] decision of like do I want to pay
[49:27] certain amount for something ahead of
[49:29] time when I don't know what it is um so
[49:32] that's kind of an unsolved problem now
[49:34] as for I guess more maybe more
[49:36] traditional value for Value which is
[49:38] paying after the fact it's a novel idea
[49:41] right that you're going to consume
[49:42] something have an experience and then
[49:44] decide how much to
[49:46] contribute on a voluntary basis for it
[49:50] um and like I said I think individuals
[49:52] can and have pulled it off but does it
[49:54] does it scale
[49:56] I'm not I'm not sure yeah so cautiously
[50:00] optimistic about Innovation but not sure
[50:03] um if anyone's really cracked it yet
[50:05] yeah it's it's a difficult because also
[50:07] when you think about a
[50:09] consumer um he goes on a website wants
[50:12] to consume something like an article or
[50:14] podcast or videos whatever it is and if
[50:18] they get just an ad by the side or the
[50:21] the podcast uh podcaster is just reading
[50:24] an ad in the middle like in the like
[50:27] after 20 minutes like one minute ad uh
[50:29] it's it's easy like you listen to it
[50:32] maybe you can skip it uh but if you have
[50:36] to pay for an episode before or after
[50:40] you consumed it uh you have you you you
[50:44] you want you you want to pay for it
[50:46] because it was so great uh that's
[50:49] difficult
[50:50] like having having such an economy um
[50:54] but if it works it would be tremendously
[50:57] amazing uh I also don't see it work
[51:00] right now um I see ad Revenue just being
[51:05] so much of a greater income source for
[51:08] most people than they can ever make for
[51:10] value for Value yeah um for me it's now
[51:14] difficult to say because I don't make
[51:16] money either way like I have no ad ad
[51:18] sense anywhere I don't I'm not monetized
[51:21] on X um I mean I have a lightning wallet
[51:24] and that coming SS in but it's for
[51:28] dollar terms really really small amount
[51:30] and um I I would like I am really
[51:34] curious about it so when I saw and hear
[51:37] you talking about it it was interesting
[51:39] to me and yeah we having an end routine
[51:43] on that podcast where the previous guest
[51:47] asked a question for the next guest I
[51:49] stole that idea from the the Diary of a
[51:52] CEO and I just loved that idea and was
[51:54] like I will just quickly steal that just
[51:58] because I just love it so
[52:00] much great and the previous guest asked
[52:04] a question and it's actually not Bitcoin
[52:06] related uh if you were in charge of the
[52:08] education system how would you change it
[52:11] or redesign it and would you add any
[52:14] subjects or would you get rid of any
[52:16] subjects how would you see the education
[52:18] system
[52:20] there I love this question I love the
[52:23] format
[52:24] too
[52:27] so I'll so I'll make a general point
[52:30] which I think many people would agree
[52:31] with is that massive reform is necessary
[52:35] for um educ Western education systems
[52:39] both you know at the at the high school
[52:42] and younger level and also tertiary
[52:45] education I think current systems are
[52:47] unsustainable and failing and so I have
[52:49] some thoughts and ideas about what could
[52:51] be done now I'll preface this by also
[52:54] saying that I don't have any children
[52:55] yet and I know people who do I know that
[52:57] it's easier to uh talk about the
[53:00] problems and easier to speculate about
[53:02] possible solutions than it is in
[53:03] practice to execute on them particularly
[53:07] when you have uh children and you are um
[53:11] just trying to do the best thing you can
[53:14] um in perhaps you know not a super risky
[53:17] way for your kids having said all
[53:21] that something that I find really
[53:22] interesting about education education
[53:25] Trends over the past few years is that
[53:27] you know if you look at the rates of
[53:30] homeschooling basically since Co
[53:34] 2020 home The Homeschool numbers has
[53:37] like gone absolutely like parabolic like
[53:40] it's like you know bitcoin price level
[53:44] growth of the number of people being
[53:46] homeschooled um you know partly that's
[53:48] because people had to stay out of
[53:49] schools for a while but I think it's
[53:51] it's deeper than that which is there is
[53:53] a increasing recognition that um
[53:55] schooling systems uh in many ways suck
[53:59] so what am I I can't remember what the
[54:00] question was it like what am I excited
[54:02] about or what do I predict or do I think
[54:03] needs to happen I guess a combination of
[54:06] all of those things is um I would
[54:09] say Technology based solutions that
[54:13] allow students to get
[54:16] individualized
[54:18] customized support um and I already see
[54:22] some like really cool examples of of
[54:24] companies being built proding products
[54:25] that do this but I think you know I I
[54:28] fundamentally fundamentally believe that
[54:30] the best form of education is like a a
[54:32] kind of tutor pupil relationship
[54:35] one-on-one um you know it's the most
[54:37] Lindy form of
[54:39] Education um it's just the best way to
[54:41] do it now it doesn't scale in you know
[54:44] in in Mass democracies we have these
[54:45] kind of factory farm public education
[54:47] systems because these days you know you
[54:50] need two parents going to work and and
[54:52] you need child care and all this other
[54:53] stuff but
[54:56] all of that aside the kind of
[54:59] onetoone um tutoring is I think um not
[55:04] in the best form of education but that's
[55:06] where the most exciting developments are
[55:07] and in particularly
[55:08] AI um AI based models like there's a
[55:12] company called synthesis school it's
[55:14] building some really cool things here so
[55:17] um yeah excited about uh about big
[55:20] changes in
[55:22] education that's what AI is really
[55:25] interesting I uh have an Indian
[55:28] girlfriend and I try to learn Hindi uh
[55:32] it's it's it's a really difficult
[55:34] language I I don't try to learn the the
[55:37] the uh the sence I'm staying in our sign
[55:41] language um and I programmed myself an
[55:45] gbt that learns me Hindi and it's
[55:49] actually quite good like there are a lot
[55:51] of apps out there like du lingo and
[55:53] other apps like that do an amazing job
[55:56] in learning you and and
[55:58] language um but it's actually really
[56:01] easy to just program yourself and gbt
[56:04] then you're saying hey I I'm at this
[56:07] level I want to learn uh this kind of
[56:10] language or I like I'm sure it works
[56:12] with math I'm sure it works with
[56:15] everything and it's quite good because
[56:18] you can always change it up if you're
[56:20] like oh I don't like those kinds of
[56:22] sorts uh then you can ask it and please
[56:24] those excis I don't like uh make it more
[56:28] fun for that uh or I'm kind of stuck at
[56:30] that that language level how can I
[56:33] accelerate because it has all the
[56:35] information uh it's it's an interesting
[56:38] like AI brings an interesting
[56:40] perspective into the the whole schooling
[56:44] system I think yeah yeah that's it's
[56:46] incredible you know it's like the most
[56:48] famous example I can think of is like uh
[56:52] you know Alexander the Great was
[56:54] personal cheed and educated by Aristotle
[56:57] I think I'm completely got that wrong
[57:00] but anyway so the idea is the idea here
[57:01] is like obviously in the modern world up
[57:04] until today such a thing at scale for
[57:07] everybody is like a you know impossible
[57:09] notion but with AI you know this this is
[57:11] the vision right with AI is that every
[57:14] student in the world has their own
[57:16] Aristotle educating them from Cradle to
[57:21] adulthood so it's an incredibly re uary
[57:25] idea I think yeah that's great uh that's
[57:29] really great um a good point where we
[57:32] can end it up now where can people find
[57:35] you where can you where do you want to
[57:37] lead them uh uh what what is the ways to
[57:41] get in contact with you yeah uh two two
[57:44] places to go one if you're interested in
[57:46] Apollo um and and what Apollo does um
[57:50] helping people to compare and find
[57:52] Bitcoin products and services just go to
[57:54] hey
[57:55] h e y a p
[57:58] o.com uh and if you want to get in touch
[58:00] with me or follow along with me I'm I'm
[58:02] on X um Julian double far um maybe in
[58:08] postproduction you can throw that up
[58:09] there I can spell it out for them now um
[58:11] but yeah those will be the two spots um
[58:13] the check out Apollo and and track me
[58:16] down on X oh great thank you for being
[58:19] on Julian yeah thanks Robin this is
[58:22] great
