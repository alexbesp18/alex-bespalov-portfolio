[00:00] their life isn't bad because blue team
[00:01] won or red team won their life is bad
[00:03] because the money's broken my goal here
[00:05] is to write a book that orange pills the
[00:07] world just a lot of things came together
[00:09] you know my age having seen the history
[00:11] of the monetary system being a gold guy
[00:13] before Bitcoin I I feel like we're in
[00:15] that really steep part of the curve
[00:17] where you know 10 15 years from now I
[00:19] think we're going to evolve into a
[00:20] monetary system where this is going to
[00:22] become the store of value Asset not
[00:24] Government Bond you know each of those
[00:25] touched an area of the world I mean
[00:27] Facebook touched you know connectivity
[00:29] or you know go Google touched
[00:30] information and you know money touches
[00:32] everything I mean it'll be a much higher
[00:34] price obviously because of the fixed
[00:36] Supply I I think we're going to go to a
[00:38] million you know within a three to five
[00:39] year one window and I think we're going
[00:40] to go to 10 million in the next five
[00:42] years after that the increase in growth
[00:44] compared to Fiat will slow down because
[00:46] the adoption Curve will slow down you
[00:47] know the title is the big print I mean
[00:49] we've already had two big prints right
[00:50] we had one in 2020 we had one in 2008
[00:53] there were smaller prints before that
[00:54] and and my view is the next big print's
[00:56] coming
[00:59] [Music]
[01:01] hi Larry how you doing everything fine
[01:03] on your end yeah I'm good thank you um
[01:05] as you can imagine I'm kind of
[01:07] busy because um the book was launched
[01:10] one week ago now and uh so far so good
[01:13] you know but it's led to a lot of stuff
[01:14] a lot of podcast a lot of DMS and I
[01:16] can't kind of keep up with it all but
[01:18] I'm doing my best yeah like I usually
[01:20] researched the guest and seen like what
[01:23] is the recent podcast that he he was
[01:25] been on and I was like there are
[01:28] many yeah well when you do one of these
[01:30] things I mean as I think I told you when
[01:32] when we were last together my goal here
[01:35] is to write a book that orange pills the
[01:36] world um I you know tried to write a
[01:39] book that would be understandable by the
[01:41] average man and therefore you know um
[01:44] we'd have a good chance of a lot of
[01:46] people um you know reading it and um and
[01:49] getting orange pilled really cool how
[01:51] was the first response because now I
[01:53] think it's out uh since not that long
[01:55] like since a few weeks basically how was
[01:57] the first response to the to the book
[02:00] it's been good I mean in terms of you
[02:01] know sales I've been told that the
[02:02] volumes are good um you know I've moved
[02:05] up some of the Amazon lists I mean it's
[02:07] still early days and I think it's really
[02:09] kind of bitcoiners who are buying it
[02:11] right now um I'm going to kind of define
[02:14] success as if we can get outside of the
[02:15] Bitcoin ecosystem uh and get it to
[02:18] normies um because that's really what
[02:20] it's aimed at you know I want I want I
[02:22] want every American to read it or every
[02:24] person really around the world to read
[02:25] it and understand the the nature of the
[02:28] monetary system why the Monet system is
[02:30] broken how unfair that is and then you
[02:33] know obviously to to make the right
[02:34] choice about how to deal with it which
[02:36] you and I both know so um so I think
[02:39] it's going to be a work in process to be
[02:41] honest with you Robin I think we're
[02:42] going to have to I'm G to have to
[02:43] continue to to promote it and uh you
[02:46] know like anything in life um you know
[02:48] the the the key is to kind of get it to
[02:50] go viral you know like a good movie or
[02:52] good anything else if people like it and
[02:54] then they tell their friends about it
[02:55] and the friends tell friends and so on
[02:57] and so forth so we'll see I think it's
[02:59] very much a question mark as to whether
[03:00] or not that'll happen I I think it'll be
[03:03] a book that bitcoiners like and that's
[03:05] good and that's great um but I I really
[03:07] hope it's a book that you know average
[03:09] people like too because that's where
[03:11] that's what you know that's why I wrote
[03:13] it right yeah absolutely like you you
[03:15] didn't write it to uh massage the brain
[03:18] of bitcoiners you want to you get to no
[03:20] coiners to like let them think a little
[03:22] bit like okay what's POS that's the
[03:24] whole point I mean when I was I I was
[03:27] looking I started writing about seven
[03:29] months ago and May or June of last year
[03:30] and u i was watching some program and I
[03:34] just saw you know blue and red arguing
[03:35] with each other you guys are all missing
[03:37] the main
[03:38] point that the money is broken and I
[03:40] thought well so I should say that and I
[03:42] well some people have done a pretty good
[03:43] job of saying that you know safe said it
[03:45] and Lynn said it others have said it but
[03:47] um but maybe not in terms that you know
[03:49] were easy to read and so I tried to you
[03:52] know I mean as an example there's a
[03:53] footnote of in the early pages of what
[03:54] is the Federal Reserve because I had a
[03:56] test reader read it and they go you know
[03:57] you've introduced this Federal Reserve I
[03:58] don't know what that is
[04:00] and so uh so we you know we kind of go
[04:02] from first principles of you know how
[04:04] how America has drifted off course and
[04:06] the world too but I write it obviously
[04:08] as an American how America's drifted off
[04:10] course in terms of the money system and
[04:11] then you know what what it's how it's
[04:13] gotten worse over time and why you know
[04:16] we now all suffer from this inflation
[04:18] which is just so painful um you know
[04:20] anyone who goes to the grocery store
[04:22] knows that you know the the they say
[04:24] we're going back to 2 or 3% but we're
[04:26] not I mean things just keep getting
[04:27] continually more expensive so it's very
[04:30] it's very painful it's hurting a lot of
[04:31] people um and so the sooner we can get
[04:34] to this new system the better off we'll
[04:35] all be absolutely just a a short
[04:40] Sidetrack here but what do you think
[04:41] about National reserve of of of Bitcoin
[04:44] with Trump with all the things going on
[04:46] maybe even like with the meme coin that
[04:48] he kind of launched yeah yeah well I
[04:50] wasn't really excited to see him do the
[04:51] meme coins I I you know I mean maybe
[04:54] that's like selling you know Trump steak
[04:55] knives or something but um you know in
[04:58] so far especially if he sold into them
[05:00] and I don't know if he did or didn't but
[05:01] setting that aside let's talk about the
[05:03] Strategic Reserve I mean I'm of I think
[05:05] I've told other podcasters I'm of two
[05:06] minds on this I mean um so you know I'm
[05:10] not sure I'm in favor of having a big
[05:11] powerful central government anyway you
[05:13] know I kind of like the Swiss model or
[05:15] other models a little bit better but
[05:16] since we do have a big powerful
[05:18] government um if we want it to you know
[05:21] dominate V the other governments and I
[05:23] do feel like the US system is better
[05:25] than the Chinese system or the Russian
[05:26] system um you know then then I think
[05:28] having the government purchase Bitcoin
[05:30] as a strategic asset does make sense um
[05:33] kind of the Jason Lowry thesis on the
[05:35] other hand um there's a part of me
[05:37] that's kind of like you know Bitcoin
[05:38] should be just for bitcoiners and why do
[05:40] we want to even have the government
[05:41] involved um but you know having the
[05:44] government involved will make number go
[05:45] up and frankly number go up is what's
[05:48] going to lead to increased adoption so
[05:50] as I say I'm kind of of two minds uh I'm
[05:52] not a favor I'm not a favorite of
[05:54] governments in general and a big
[05:56] centralized governments in fact the book
[05:58] talks about that how I think that you
[05:59] know the centralized governments are
[06:01] kind of slowly but surely failing and
[06:03] the the great trend of our age and it's
[06:05] a really good trend is is
[06:06] decentralization you know the technology
[06:09] and decentralization I mean the internet
[06:11] is decentralized information it's
[06:12] allowed guys like you and Rogan and
[06:15] Tucker to you know become alternative
[06:17] news sources and because we know that
[06:19] the existing news sources that protect
[06:21] the power structure have lied to us you
[06:23] know for years so um the technological
[06:27] Advance advances I think are the most
[06:28] hopeful part of what's going on right
[06:30] now and I I talk about that in the book
[06:32] there's a lot of Hope in the book so I I
[06:35] love that that part that there is hope
[06:37] in there but I'm Al I'm really wondering
[06:40] because exactly what you're saying of of
[06:42] like what would happen if actually like
[06:44] America who has now the strongest Fe
[06:46] currencies really goes ahead and and is
[06:49] aggressively buying Bitcoin maybe like
[06:51] with the Federal Reserve involved it
[06:53] could really prolong the life of the
[06:56] yeah so that's the dream right I I don't
[06:58] think honestly that's going to happen I
[07:00] mean I think if they really got
[07:01] aggressive about buying Bitcoin the
[07:03] dollar would really slide and we would
[07:05] maybe accelerate you know
[07:06] hyperbitcoinization and so you know I I
[07:09] don't know what the odds are on the
[07:10] Lumis Bill getting through you know what
[07:12] that is and it's you know million coins
[07:14] 200 a year for five years um I've heard
[07:16] the odds are some people say they're
[07:18] good some people say they're bad I just
[07:19] don't know um but my sense is that much
[07:23] more likely I mean look it's good that
[07:24] they they established a strategic crypto
[07:27] Reserve I hate that word but they did it
[07:30] and you know bitcoiners I mean this is
[07:31] politics right you have to live with
[07:33] half of what you want I mean I wish it
[07:35] were a strategic Bitcoin reserve and
[07:36] there were no other coins in there but
[07:38] guess what all those other coin holders
[07:40] paid a lot of money to Trump to help get
[07:42] him into office and so you know there'll
[07:44] probably be some other coins in that
[07:45] Reserve as well and so be it um but yeah
[07:48] I mean as sailor says you know the first
[07:50] country to print money to buy Bitcoin
[07:52] wins um and so you know we could if we
[07:56] announced we were going to really start
[07:57] aggressively buying Bitcoin you know
[08:00] that would be I think very powerful for
[08:02] the government very powerful for all us
[08:04] bitcoiners and but frankly it would
[08:06] accelerate the demise of the dollar um
[08:08] and I'm not sure they want to do that I
[08:10] mean and and I could even argue that
[08:11] there's maybe a case not to do that that
[08:13] that we're better off trying to go you
[08:15] know have a transition period between
[08:17] you know this total Fiat system that
[08:19] we've got and a system based on sound
[08:20] money I mean we've got to get to a
[08:22] system based on sound money there's no
[08:24] doubt about that the book explains that
[08:26] um but I think you know we're headed
[08:28] there so the question is just at at what
[08:30] rate you know absolutely it's really
[08:33] interesting uh by the way I I I'm am
[08:37] understanding it right that that's your
[08:38] first book that did you wrote this is my
[08:40] first probably my only book yeah it's uh
[08:44] it's writing a book is a real task you
[08:46] know especially if you want to try and
[08:47] make it good and I think it's good I I
[08:49] certainly made it as good as I could
[08:51] possibly make it and uh it was a lot of
[08:53] work um then and it you know I felt kind
[08:56] of inspired to do it just a lot of
[08:58] things came together you know my age
[09:00] having seen the history of the monetary
[09:02] system being a gold guy before Bitcoin
[09:06] um you know kind of all of it I I just
[09:07] thought I was in a kind of a unique
[09:09] position I you know somebody tweeted out
[09:11] recently occasionally in life you feel
[09:12] like you get tapped on the shoulder and
[09:14] say hey there's something you should do
[09:15] here uh and that's kind of how it felt
[09:17] for me I me when I was writing it just
[09:18] poured out of me I just knew exactly
[09:20] what I wanted to say it was kind of
[09:22] almost like divinely inspired so um yeah
[09:25] you know it um you know maybe maybe with
[09:28] this book I'll enjoy my 15 minutes of
[09:30] fame and then I'll fade away and that's
[09:32] fine um but I'm not going to I'm not in
[09:34] the book writing business in general and
[09:37] you know immodestly I guess I just hope
[09:39] this thing can really you know change
[09:41] the world in fact one of the things that
[09:42] also drove me to write it I was talking
[09:43] to a ghost writer earlier last year and
[09:46] she said something to me she said you
[09:47] know Larry you know you know a lot about
[09:49] this stuff you have a view on it you
[09:51] know you're strong about it on Twitter
[09:53] you know books can change the world and
[09:54] I that really kind of that just got into
[09:56] my craw I was like oh wow you know she's
[09:58] kind of right and uh and so you know
[10:00] it's IM modest on my part but I really
[10:02] do hope this book can change the world
[10:04] you know if we can get it if if enough
[10:06] people can read it enough people can
[10:07] understand the monetary problem enough
[10:09] people can convert to bitcoin you know
[10:11] as my friend Jeff Bo says if we all went
[10:13] to bitcoin tomorrow you know fat would
[10:15] collapse and so but that's not going to
[10:18] happen obviously there's going to be a
[10:19] time time period over which we adopt it
[10:22] so so it's um yeah that's that's kind of
[10:25] the background of it all yeah and and
[10:28] and the book is I think a really good
[10:29] for Orange Building because like you can
[10:31] send a video or podcast that's great and
[10:34] and you're like oh maybe he listens to
[10:36] it or maybe not but like gifting someone
[10:38] a book has something really nice to it
[10:40] and like if if Bitcoin has read that and
[10:42] like they they B buy like 10 versions of
[10:45] that and like just give it out to people
[10:47] that think they're ready for that that's
[10:48] the whole and people also learn through
[10:50] pictures and there are a lot of pictures
[10:51] in the book there are a lot of charts I
[10:53] mean I make a lot of points about how
[10:54] broken the system is and there are all
[10:56] kinds of charts in the book that really
[10:58] show you that you you know
[10:59] I hope that I impart information to
[11:01] people who are unaware of that
[11:02] information they read it they go oh my
[11:04] goodness this is really a problem you
[11:06] know I I that's that's the goal right is
[11:09] to educate and and get the average
[11:11] person to understand that their life
[11:13] isn't bad because blue team W and red
[11:15] team W their life is bad because the
[11:16] money's broken you know and the Federal
[11:19] Reserve presented you know printed 40%
[11:21] of the money supply in two-year time
[11:22] frame that's why inflation is killing
[11:25] them um and you know and that by the way
[11:28] that's you know the title the big print
[11:29] I mean we've already had two big prints
[11:31] right we had one in 2020 we had one in
[11:33] 2008 and there were smaller prints
[11:35] before that and and my view is the next
[11:37] big print's coming and so you know the
[11:40] sooner we people prepare themselves for
[11:43] it protect themselves against it the
[11:45] better off they'll be and then the
[11:46] sooner we all move to a sound money
[11:48] system the better off the world will be
[11:50] you know and that's the the fix the
[11:52] money fix the world phrase so uh so yeah
[11:55] I mean it's like I said it's the best I
[11:57] could do in the time I had and uhod
[12:00] modestly I hope it really changes the
[12:02] conversation and moves Us in the right
[12:04] direction and especially those the the
[12:07] thing of like those big prints get
[12:09] bigger over time well that's right yeah
[12:12] that's a very good point I made that
[12:13] point in the book I mean some people say
[12:14] how do you why do you think it's going
[12:15] to happen now and why do you think the
[12:17] monetary system is failing now I said
[12:19] because each one it's like it's like
[12:21] childbirth the contractions get you know
[12:22] they're harder and they get closer
[12:24] together I mean Baki printed you know $3
[12:26] trillion doll in three or four years
[12:28] after the GFC you know Powell printed $5
[12:31] trillion in less than two years you know
[12:34] so it's it's just like wow and and I
[12:37] think the next one you know could be
[12:39] even bigger still so super interesting
[12:43] uh just wondering about that because I'm
[12:44] currently also like trying to write
[12:46] thoughts down and I I see how it kind of
[12:49] uh shapes some thoughts that I have
[12:51] around Bitcoin did the process of
[12:54] writing the book influence how you think
[12:57] about Bitcoin in certain perspectives
[12:58] even like in a small manner it really
[13:01] did you you know when you forcing
[13:03] yourself to write something down forces
[13:05] you to really think about it very
[13:06] clearly and you and you have insights I
[13:09] mean obviously I did a lot of research
[13:10] on the history of the monetary system
[13:11] some of which I knew some of which I
[13:13] didn't and so there were some good
[13:14] insights that came out of that but
[13:16] probably the most fascinating Insight I
[13:17] mentioned this on other podcast but it
[13:19] just it it really just kind of struck me
[13:21] in the face as I was writing the section
[13:22] on the investment you know Bitcoin is an
[13:24] investment was I went and I looked at
[13:26] these other network businesses you know
[13:28] prior to bitcoin you know and the most
[13:30] notable being Amazon Facebook and Google
[13:32] and um and I looked at the stock price
[13:35] performance of those Network businesses
[13:36] since they IED and they're all under 25
[13:38] years old they were all formed in the
[13:40] you know in the do com boom and what
[13:42] they showed me was just that mef's law
[13:44] is just a really different thing that
[13:47] kind of changes the rules of investing
[13:49] and so you know I think since in
[13:51] Inception in IPO uh Amazon is up 200,000
[13:55] per. you know I think um Google is up
[13:58] 9,000 Facebook is up 2,000% I mean you
[14:01] know there haven't been until Network
[14:04] businesses came along there were no
[14:06] businesses that went up that much in in
[14:08] the 20-year time window just none I mean
[14:11] General Motors you know went up 400x
[14:13] from 1916 to present but it you know I
[14:16] mean these are these are thousands of
[14:18] percent gains on big businesses not I me
[14:20] occasionally you get a little small
[14:21] company they'll have a multi th000 per
[14:23] gain because they go from being small to
[14:25] being big but these are huge businesses
[14:28] that have just compounded and grown
[14:29] enormously valuable over a 20-year time
[14:32] frame and and that's because networks
[14:35] grow and the value grows at a at a
[14:38] exponential rate compared to the linear
[14:40] growth of the users I mean some say met
[14:43] caplaw as a square you know so you know
[14:45] the value grows at the square of the
[14:46] underlying number of users and and I'm
[14:48] not sure to what power it is but the
[14:50] point is that this is different and I
[14:53] missed it you know I when back in the
[14:54] 2000 area and that whole time frame I
[14:56] was looking at these other businesses
[14:58] and investment I was investing manager I
[14:59] was supposed to be buying growth at a
[15:00] reasonable price and I looked at these
[15:02] businesses and I couldn't get there
[15:04] because they're too expensive using
[15:06] historical you know valuation metrics
[15:08] you know when I applied kind of what
[15:10] what I've been taught it was like well I
[15:12] can't pay that kind of multiple for this
[15:14] business but I was wrong you know
[15:16] because and and what I didn't understand
[15:18] was the way the networking changes at
[15:20] all and so you know here we are with
[15:23] Bitcoin and it's it's the same type of
[15:26] thing and arguably it's even bigger
[15:27] because you know each of those touched
[15:29] an area of the world I mean Facebook
[15:30] touched you know connectivity or you
[15:32] know Google touched information and and
[15:35] uh so forth and you know Amazon touches
[15:37] kind of Walmart but you know money
[15:39] touches everything you know everybody
[15:41] uses money and it gets used in every
[15:43] single Marketplace for every single
[15:44] transaction and so here we have here we
[15:47] are we have a network business or a
[15:49] network phenomena based about money and
[15:52] so it's just like you know that's why I
[15:56] I I try to convince people this is
[15:58] different you know you're going to they
[15:59] say there's nothing different in
[16:00] investing and that's true until there's
[16:03] an invention or a change in you know in
[16:05] the Paradigm I mean you know and and and
[16:08] that's why I I have a section on
[16:09] skepticism and I talk about it it's like
[16:11] this is like you know I mean before
[16:13] airplanes got invented people didn't fly
[16:15] they just didn't and uh then once
[16:17] airplanes got invented people did fly
[16:19] you know or before the printing press
[16:20] things were written out by hand after
[16:21] the printing press they weren't I mean
[16:23] before the telegraph you know we had the
[16:25] Pony Express I mean it it it's just kind
[16:27] of like you know this is is a change
[16:29] this is a new form of money based on a
[16:32] technology that represents a complete
[16:33] change in the way things are done and so
[16:36] the book was aimed at trying to get
[16:37] people to see that and understand that
[16:40] and then invest and benefit from that
[16:42] right and protect themselves against a a
[16:44] broken and corrup I mean it's it's like
[16:46] fabulous it's it's almost god-given that
[16:47] we got this change at the same time that
[16:50] the old corrupt system was really really
[16:52] hurting people you know and so you know
[16:55] I mean maybe you didn't realize you
[16:56] needed Bitcoin in 2014 but after what's
[16:59] happened since then with all the
[17:00] inflation the printing you know it's
[17:02] pretty obvious you need Bitcoin
[17:04] now yeah it's it's kind of like if you
[17:07] want once get get it like you're you're
[17:09] almost all in in one thing um maybe
[17:13] really interesting uh like two or three
[17:14] guests ago we had on on that like
[17:16] compared the uh adoption rate and the
[17:19] growth of different Technologies and he
[17:21] went all the way back to like
[17:23] electricity uh the printing press and
[17:25] all the things and he he kind of showed
[17:27] that it gets uh quicker
[17:29] quicker those things are in the book I'm
[17:31] gonna try I'm G to try and find the page
[17:33] I'm not sure I will but there are some
[17:35] really great charts of those things in
[17:37] the book that kind of show show the
[17:39] adoption rates and I mean it's I can't
[17:41] find the page quickly but um yeah and
[17:44] and adoption with in a digital age
[17:45] things are getting adopted more quickly
[17:48] um and you know this it's there's
[17:50] another chart in the book that shows how
[17:51] you know the growth of Bitcoin adoption
[17:53] or is really kind of mirroring the
[17:55] growth of the internet you know and in
[17:57] in equivalent terms I mean the internet
[17:58] was founded well it was really founded
[18:00] back in 68 or 9 with darp nut but but it
[18:03] really became kind of commercially
[18:04] useful in the early 90s and I started
[18:06] investing at 93 um the first Netscape
[18:09] browser was 95 but it's still kind of
[18:11] clunky by 2000 the internet was really
[18:14] working and uh um you know and growing
[18:17] rapidly and uh you know the the
[18:19] comparable is that we're now kind of in
[18:21] 1998 and and about to enter that really
[18:24] steep part of the adoption curve for
[18:25] Bitcoin and that's Michael sailor said
[18:27] that many times it look the next 10
[18:29] years are really the Golden Age where we
[18:31] kind of go through Malcolm gladwell's
[18:33] Tipping Point where okay 10% of the
[18:36] people get it you know now we're going
[18:37] to get rapid Mass adoption by the
[18:40] balance of of the people who haven't
[18:42] heard about it or bought it yet I found
[18:44] the one that um the previous guest
[18:46] showed and probably will be a similar
[18:49] thing yeah mine's a similar chart it's
[18:51] not exactly the same but it is similar
[18:53] yeah and it it just it just B I never
[18:56] heard that before like how and and saw
[18:59] it like how how quick it actually goes
[19:01] and when you see like telephone
[19:02] electricity and radio how how this went
[19:05] and then like the it's like smartphones
[19:08] tablets and digital cameras cell phones
[19:10] and then there's like Bitcoin and and
[19:12] we're like really in the infant State
[19:14] and if you see that like it just made me
[19:17] even more bullish which is really hard
[19:19] no it's yeah it's that's a great chart
[19:22] and it's you know it's look a lot of
[19:24] investing is pattern recognition you
[19:26] know what I mean you kind of and and
[19:28] things the same things kind of happen
[19:30] over and over again and if you can see
[19:31] the pattern you know then you know it's
[19:34] um it's a useful way it's a useful model
[19:37] but I mean the trick of course is to
[19:39] recognize the exception to the rule I
[19:40] mean on a pattern recognition basis
[19:42] that's how I miss Bitcoin because I
[19:44] thought well or I mean that's how I
[19:45] missed all these other digital companies
[19:47] because I thought well they're too
[19:48] overpriced because I was using the old
[19:50] pattern and what I didn't realize is
[19:52] that meta's law kind of is a new pattern
[19:55] um and so you know so it's it's yeah
[19:58] it's it's an interesting intellectual
[20:00] exercise to try and understand how it's
[20:01] going to get adopted I partnered up with
[20:04] coin vigilante this is the most
[20:07] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[20:10] saw created by anyone look at that
[20:12] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante

[22:14] do you think it it will go to like an
[22:16] option rates of like 25 or 50% like
[22:19] right now we we're now I think this I
[22:21] think this will I think this cycle we're
[22:23] in it I mean you know I think that uh I
[22:26] think in the next 10 or 15 years it'll
[22:28] be widespread um almost everyone will
[22:32] have it or be aware you know have it
[22:34] there'll be and at that point after that
[22:35] you'll be a late adopter if you come
[22:37] into it so so I I feel like we're in
[22:39] that really steep part of the curve
[22:41] where you know 10 15 years from now um
[22:45] you know that they'll all have it and
[22:46] that kind of tracks with my sense of how
[22:48] the monetary system is going to evolve I
[22:50] mean I think we're going to evolve into
[22:52] a monetary system where this is going to
[22:53] become the store of value Asset not
[22:56] government bonds or not even gold
[22:59] and that as a result of that you know
[23:00] people are going to try and hold this
[23:02] asset um for their savings and and what
[23:04] they want to see grow and then of course
[23:06] they'll use you know maybe the dollar
[23:08] maybe lightning Network or maybe another
[23:10] third you know a second layer
[23:12] transaction Network to actually pay the
[23:14] bills but everything will swap back into
[23:16] Bitcoin because Bitcoin is the way to
[23:18] save um and and I I think that's I think
[23:21] it's in a ten your window very very
[23:24] comfortably
[23:26] amazing what do you think like I look
[23:28] back at like I I cannot make the
[23:31] comparison with like uh smartphones
[23:33] because I kind of grew up with
[23:34] smartphones like since I'm 17 years old
[23:36] I have smartphones but uh for example
[23:38] with AI it's kind of hilarious for me
[23:40] because two years ago I didn't use it at
[23:42] all and now I couldn't run my podcast p
[23:45] in the same way so like that's that's
[23:48] just amazing how how quick this went
[23:51] what what do you think will will Bitcoin
[23:53] do in once we get to this the other side
[23:56] of those 10 15 years well I mean it'll
[23:59] be a much higher price obviously because
[24:01] of the fixed Supply I mean I you know I
[24:04] I think we're going to go to a million
[24:05] you know within a three to five year one
[24:07] window and I think we're going to go to
[24:08] 10 million in the next five years after
[24:09] that um and at some point the the you
[24:13] know the the increase in growth compared
[24:15] to Fiat will slow down because the
[24:17] adoption Curve will slow down but that's
[24:19] quite a ways out in my view um and and
[24:22] we're entering the the Steep part of the
[24:25] curve I mean and and the other thing is
[24:27] you know and I remember this because I
[24:28] was involved in the internet I invested
[24:30] in I saw it develop I mean you know in
[24:32] in in 2000 or 2003 there was a bubble
[24:34] there you know a lot of stupid stuff got
[24:36] done and they all got overpriced and and
[24:38] by the way I think there's something
[24:39] similar going on in AI I mean I think AI
[24:41] is going to change the world don't get
[24:43] me wrong I think some great application
[24:44] extremely important but I also think I
[24:47] feel like right now it's kind of gotten
[24:48] ahead of itself it reminds me a little
[24:50] bit of 2000 where the internet got ahead
[24:51] of itself and you know the thing that
[24:54] was interesting in 2000 you actually
[24:56] really couldn't see you know I mean we
[24:58] knew it was important and we were all
[25:00] sending emails we were all browsing the
[25:01] web but you didn't really know how it
[25:04] was going to all unfold you didn't know
[25:06] I you could kind of see Google catching
[25:08] some steam and and you know you could
[25:10] kind of see Amazon originally selling
[25:12] books not everything um and you could
[25:14] see these businesses coming up you could
[25:16] see eBay which is an online you know
[25:17] kind of swap meet but um you didn't you
[25:21] didn't know you know I mean Facebook
[25:23] hadn't even come out yet I don't think
[25:24] and so you just didn't know and and you
[25:26] didn't know what the apps would be and
[25:27] there' be you know look at the internet
[25:29] today I mean you obviously the Broadband
[25:31] thing got you know the bandwidth got
[25:33] higher and now here we are you know
[25:34] you're in Austria I'm in America we're
[25:35] talking to each other and we can send
[25:37] this out to millions of people with no
[25:38] friction I mean that's just stunning and
[25:41] and but you didn't know you couldn't see
[25:43] that in 2000 and here we are 24 years
[25:45] later so so it's a little hard looking
[25:48] at Bitcoin to know exactly how it's
[25:50] going to evolve and what all the apps
[25:51] are going to be but they you know it's
[25:53] it's a powerful technology and so as a
[25:55] result of that you know there'll be some
[25:57] really great things that'll that will
[25:58] come of it um and when they happen
[26:00] you'll be like oh yeah that was obvious
[26:02] that of course you should do it that way
[26:04] you know it's better cheaper faster
[26:06] easier you know verifiable so so those
[26:09] all those are all coming but you know
[26:10] they'll they'll be you know they um
[26:13] Marketplace of ideas and technologies
[26:15] will sort through you know they're a
[26:17] million entrepreneurs trying to build
[26:19] things around the internet or I mean
[26:21] around Bitcoin and the best ideas will
[26:23] win and uh you know there'll be some
[26:26] very good businesses built as my guess
[26:29] it's interesting also to think about
[26:30] like what would what would the world
[26:33] look like right now if there wouldn't be
[26:35] any Bitcoin and gold would be our our
[26:37] best bet currently yeah yeah it'd be
[26:40] it'd be significantly different I mean
[26:43] and and Bitcoin has taken away from gold
[26:44] and taken away from the gold stocks I
[26:46] mean it's because it's such a better
[26:48] performer um yeah and I mean it it you
[26:51] know honestly it came along at the right
[26:53] time because you the monetary debasement
[26:55] got worse the gold as a solution is
[26:58] really broken because of the paper gold
[27:00] and all the manipulation in the gold
[27:02] market and so here you suddenly got this
[27:05] new tool it's a lot harder to manipulate
[27:07] if not impossible to manipulate and that
[27:10] you know that it's digital I mean it's
[27:11] got so many advantages versus gold it
[27:13] settles instantly I mean I'm sure you've
[27:15] seen and others have seen and heard
[27:17] we're doing this on the 14th or 13th you
[27:20] know that you know the London bullion
[27:22] market exchange is now experiencing big
[27:23] delays and you know what what we're
[27:25] seeing as a result of the sovereign debt
[27:27] crisis maturing getting further along in
[27:29] the road is that people are trying to
[27:31] you know central banks uh and others are
[27:34] trying to buy gold and take delivery
[27:36] because there you know I think the gold
[27:38] market has a a musical chairs like
[27:40] component to it there have been more
[27:41] gold claims sold than there are ounces
[27:44] of gold so if everyone has a claim
[27:46] thinks they own an ounce owns a paper
[27:47] ounce of gold and says hey give me the
[27:49] gold there won't be enough to go around
[27:51] at least not at this price and so some
[27:53] of that's taking place in London at the
[27:55] lbma and you know the comx and others
[27:57] are are getting big delivery requests
[27:59] and as a result they're they're saying
[28:01] to the lbma ship us your gold and the
[28:03] lbma is generally able to do that pretty
[28:05] quickly but now they're kind of saying
[28:06] well there's an eight-week delay and
[28:08] which leads people who kind of conclude
[28:10] well gee maybe there's you know maybe
[28:11] they don't have what they say they have
[28:12] and um you know it's it there's a lot
[28:15] just as there you know just the banks
[28:17] operate on a fractional reserve and and
[28:19] you know you can't all go down to the
[28:20] bank and ask for cash and get it because
[28:21] the bank doesn't have enough cash to
[28:22] give you all your money um the gold
[28:24] market is kind of the same way so and
[28:27] it's it's interesting interesting timing
[28:28] that that's coming along but again you
[28:30] know if you look at that problem Bitcoin
[28:33] fixes this right I mean you know it's
[28:35] never I mean it's funny the album they
[28:37] said something along the lines of the
[28:38] well the Gold's really heavy and there
[28:39] are a lot of L lores blocking the street
[28:42] so you know we've got these which is
[28:43] hilarious so we've got these delays well
[28:45] that doesn't happen with Bitcoin I mean
[28:47] I can move a billion dollars in 10
[28:49] minutes um and you know with no excuses
[28:51] and and by the way 247 so um you know
[28:55] it's it's a superior you know store of
[28:58] value and it's a lot easier to store and
[28:59] transfer than gold absolutely do you do
[29:03] you feel like uh I get that sometimes I
[29:06] I don't pay a lot of big attention to
[29:07] that but uh it does come up where people
[29:10] feel like black crog and other people
[29:12] might play similar games on top of
[29:15] Bitcoin they played with with with gold
[29:17] that kind of thing it's a fair concern
[29:19] and I and I hold it too I mean as long
[29:21] as derivatives exist you get worried
[29:23] about people creating quote unquote
[29:24] paper Bitcoin I mean Sam bankman fre did
[29:27] it he said he had Bitcoin on balance
[29:28] sheet and he didn't he sold Bitcoin to
[29:29] people that he didn't have um you know
[29:32] they're bad actors and as long as there
[29:33] are Bad actors people can create paper
[29:35] claims I mean you know one could argue
[29:37] that even the you know the ETFs are
[29:39] somewhat of a paper claim unless they
[29:41] can show proof of reserves that they
[29:42] actually hold the coins that they claim
[29:44] I mean I I think in the Gold World the
[29:46] GLD uh ETF I I'm pretty sure that they
[29:49] have rehypothecation and don't
[29:50] necessarily own all the gold they claim
[29:52] they old and so you know if Black Rock
[29:54] started doing that that would be a
[29:55] problem now they'd have to have the
[29:57] auditors on it because I assume the
[29:59] Auditors can see the digital addresses
[30:01] where those coins are and you know the
[30:03] coins are either there or they're not so
[30:06] um but yeah I mean there've been and
[30:07] there've been derivatives in the in the
[30:09] Bitcoin space I mean they Futures and
[30:11] options and and uh so forth and but if
[30:14] you look at the size of those um you
[30:16] know and they're traded on the Chicago
[30:17] Markel exchange they're not very big I
[30:20] mean the one thing I will say about the
[30:21] gold markets they've had 50 years to
[30:22] figure out how to manipulate it they've
[30:23] done a really good job and they've got
[30:25] the bis on their side they got all the
[30:27] central banks of the world have figured
[30:28] out how to keep the price of gold down
[30:30] this thing isn't nearly as old it's 15
[30:32] years old but it wasn't you know it
[30:33] really didn't count until recently when
[30:34] it became larger and um and so it's kind
[30:37] of gotten underneath their radar and you
[30:39] know they may come after it and try and
[30:41] figure out a way to manipulate it's not
[30:42] going to be easy they I think it it's
[30:44] true is gold you know gold never goes up
[30:46] 5x in an 18month period right but
[30:48] Bitcoin does and so you know they were
[30:52] able to manipulate gold because they
[30:54] could slam it with paper gold and then
[30:55] they knew the printing press would bail
[30:56] them out of the paper if there was loss
[30:58] it's a little different and and their
[31:00] loss might be 10 or 20% of what they put
[31:02] up because gold could go up 20% a year
[31:04] when you're shorting something with
[31:05] paper that goes up 500% you're going to
[31:08] get a really big
[31:10] loss and so that's going to be have a
[31:12] lot of paper that you're going to have
[31:13] to print so so I I think they've got
[31:15] their hands full trying to manipulate it
[31:17] but it's not entirely possible that
[31:19] there could be some of that in the
[31:20] future and I'm concerned about it I mean
[31:22] in the book I have a there's a chapter
[31:24] in the book called policy responses and
[31:26] one of the things I call for is an out a
[31:28] ban on financial derivatives the reason
[31:30] I do that is that derivatives allow the
[31:33] largest player at the table to win
[31:35] because that t that player has more
[31:37] money than anybody else they can make a
[31:39] bet that somebody else can't call and uh
[31:42] and and by definition the largest
[31:44] players in the world of the central
[31:45] banks because they can print the money
[31:47] they just push a button and they get as
[31:48] much money as they want and that's how
[31:51] they've manipulated all these markets
[31:52] for so many
[31:54] years there's also the the aspect of
[31:56] proof of reserves where
[31:58] maybe people will just not uh accept or
[32:02] want anything that says that hasn't have
[32:05] a pro of reserve and shows the addresses
[32:07] and shows that they they actually own it
[32:09] it's so easy with Bitcoin I think that's
[32:10] right and I I think all the ETF should
[32:12] do proof of reserves I mean you know I I
[32:14] know like River the broker I use I mean
[32:17] they they have proof of reserves I love
[32:18] it I think it's great that's as it
[32:19] should be um you know a lot of people
[32:22] have stored the Bitcoin at coinbase and
[32:23] I you know I'm a little ly at coinbase
[32:26] I'm not sure you know that necessarily a
[32:28] great company um I I I don't you know I
[32:31] had an account there I've taken it down
[32:32] to a very small amount I'm not sure I
[32:34] would be you know I would be there if I
[32:35] had a lot you know assets to store but
[32:38] you know I mean the ultimate Solutions
[32:40] you and I both know is just for
[32:41] individuals is just you know Cold
[32:43] Storage that you control where you've
[32:44] got the words and and that's that so you
[32:47] know and preferably in a multi- setup so
[32:49] that you're not subject to wrench
[32:51] attacks but um yeah it's it's an issue I
[32:56] mean it's it's definitely an issue but I
[32:59] I think that what's going to happen is I
[33:00] think slowly but surely the Fiat world
[33:02] is going to die and you know we're going
[33:05] to be in a much better world where
[33:06] Satoshi are going to be the you know the
[33:08] unit of a c that's is an amazing future
[33:12] um uh one thing that I wanted already to
[33:15] get in way earlier uh especially with
[33:18] your book uh but we kind of touched on
[33:20] some of that already um how did you go
[33:23] ahead and structured it and like what
[33:25] are the kind of the key points that you
[33:27] that you covered
[33:28] yeah just to remind myself I'm going to
[33:30] look at the at the uh table of contents
[33:32] here I mean so basically you know I I
[33:36] started off with kind of some
[33:37] interesting stories to try and hook the
[33:39] reader because people don't read
[33:41] textbooks they tend to read you know
[33:43] novels and they like to watch movies and
[33:44] hear stories so I I started off with
[33:46] some stories and that's that's the hook
[33:48] okay and then then part one of the book
[33:51] is the problem and I the problem broadly
[33:53] defined is just inflation and the whole
[33:56] Keynesian notion that you actually need
[33:57] need inflation to run an economy and
[34:00] that's just wrong I mean that's just but
[34:02] it's you know what's happened is a deal
[34:04] has been made between the Keynesian
[34:05] academics and the people who run the
[34:06] government that they support each other
[34:09] and it you know it keeps the government
[34:10] funded and it keeps the kesian academics
[34:12] well employed and it helps the people
[34:14] who are the canones who get the benefit
[34:16] of the cheap money so so I go through a
[34:18] history of the US the US monetary system
[34:20] the Federal Reserve and and before the
[34:22] Federal Reserve and and how and why that
[34:25] system slowly but surely has gotten brok
[34:27] broken and chipped away at and so that's
[34:30] kind of part one and you know that could
[34:32] actually leave you a little bit
[34:33] depressed like gosh inflation's bad it
[34:35] keeps getting bad they keep changing the
[34:37] rules the wrong people are winning etc
[34:39] etc but part two is uh the solution and
[34:44] um so there I introduce Bitcoin and I
[34:46] talk about how and in part one also I
[34:48] talk about how you know sound money
[34:50] which we do not have right now
[34:51] definitely do not have an inflation of
[34:52] prob I talk about how it's a moral issue
[34:55] and this is nothing new it's been you
[34:57] know it was in the Bible it's it's been
[34:58] it's been talked about for decades and
[35:00] and centuries you know unsound money has
[35:02] been a problem but anyway once I once I
[35:05] get through the history of unsound money
[35:06] and how bad it's gotten for everybody
[35:08] then I go into the solution which is you
[35:11] know how do we fix this and uh I start
[35:14] off with Jeff Boo's point that you know
[35:15] we live in a deflationary world and
[35:17] therefore we need you know we need to
[35:18] embrace deflation and we need to throw
[35:21] out the Keynesian thought pattern that
[35:23] you know printing money to you know
[35:24] Kindle animal spirits to have nominal
[35:27] growth
[35:28] is what makes an economy healthy no it's
[35:30] not you know printing money debases the
[35:33] currency you know mixes up the price
[35:35] signals and and you know screws up the
[35:37] way that producers and suppliers can
[35:39] coordinate because they don't really
[35:40] they never know what a long-term value
[35:42] of of a dollar or of a currency unit is
[35:44] so so then I go into all of that and
[35:47] then I talk about Bitcoin fixes this and
[35:50] describe Bitcoin for a beginner from
[35:52] somebody you know I mean bitcoiners will
[35:53] read that they'll go you know they know
[35:54] all of this but you know the
[35:58] difficulty adjustment and all the
[35:59] important things to understand about
[36:00] Bitcoin the history of it um and then I
[36:03] go into you know kind of the skepticism
[36:05] which was actually my wife's idea it was
[36:06] a great chapter where she said look why
[36:08] don't you point out that this is a new
[36:10] technology and this has happened before
[36:12] I mean when other Technologies got
[36:14] introduced there was always a lot of
[36:15] skepticism I mean you know there was I
[36:18] mean you name it the airplane the car
[36:20] the electricity printing whatever there
[36:22] you know there are people who said oh
[36:23] that's never going to work I mean famous
[36:25] example if you're technology phobic
[36:27] you're called a lite because the guys
[36:29] back in medieval England the the Lites
[36:31] were Neil Neil Neil L was a guy who
[36:34] didn't believe in in printing or in the
[36:36] loom you know the automated Loom which
[36:38] helped them make fabric more quickly and
[36:40] so they went around smash looms because
[36:42] they were going to put people out of
[36:43] business or you know Weavers out of
[36:45] business and so um you know so I talk
[36:48] about all the techn you know the
[36:49] skepticism that that is causing people
[36:52] you know the fear uncertainty and doubt
[36:53] that's stopping people from embracing
[36:55] this and then then I kind of move into
[36:57] the investment implications you know the
[36:59] this is you know this is why I mean I
[37:02] talk about traditional Investments and
[37:03] stocks and bonds and gold and what most
[37:05] people consider to be Investments and
[37:07] then I point out you know Bitcoin and I
[37:09] talk about the investment implications
[37:10] of Bitcoin and I show the performance
[37:12] and the results and it's just kind of
[37:13] like hey look folks you know this is you
[37:16] know you can ignore this but um you know
[37:19] the last 16 years this has been the best
[37:20] performing asset in the history of the
[37:22] world so you know you probably shouldn't
[37:24] ignore it I mean you can decide you
[37:26] don't want to buy a lot of it but having
[37:28] zero of it is probably not a good idea
[37:30] and so I try and lay that out and then
[37:32] at the end I just kind of talk about you
[37:34] know policy response and how the
[37:35] government how the how how we solve this
[37:38] problem I mean the US is kind of in a
[37:39] financial dish and you know and honestly
[37:42] it's going to be painful to get out of
[37:44] this ditch I mean you can't you know the
[37:46] the debts got to be written down we've
[37:47] got to do some kind of a currency
[37:49] revaluation and so I discussed that how
[37:51] that happens and the possible outcomes
[37:53] and when I talk about the policy
[37:55] responses one president might say I've
[37:57] got the the mock presidential speech
[37:59] where you know this is what a president
[38:01] could say to take us on to a Bitcoin
[38:03] standard and then at the end I've got i'
[38:05] just kind of have I take the standard
[38:07] objections you know like it Los it uses
[38:08] too much electricity well I I I SWAT
[38:11] that one away you know I just kind of
[38:13] explain why the the standard objections
[38:15] really aren't aren't sound and then
[38:17] that's it then there's the the
[38:19] conclusion so um you know it's uh it's
[38:23] and it's meant to be and i' I've heard
[38:24] the feedback I've gotten so far is it's
[38:26] kind of working it's it's meant to be
[38:27] able to be read by anybody you don't
[38:29] have to be an investor or a crypto
[38:32] person or a financial person any of that
[38:34] stuff you you just got to be somebody
[38:35] who knows that inflation's hurting you
[38:38] and says you know and and is curious as
[38:40] to maybe why and then and then more
[38:43] Curious even in okay given that now you
[38:45] know that's bad news what what's the
[38:46] good news and the good news is there a
[38:48] solution you know and so and here it is
[38:51] and uh and here you know here are all
[38:53] the possible objections and here's why
[38:56] you know I one I've dealt with a a lot
[38:57] of things in trying to convince people
[38:58] to buy Bitcoin one of them always was
[39:00] well it's fraud because of sand bankman
[39:01] free that guy really hurt us right I
[39:04] mean you know it was it was I mean
[39:06] because you know me human beings I mean
[39:07] we use these mental heuristics right you
[39:09] just kind of you see something oh that
[39:11] guy's a fraudster all that stuff's
[39:12] fraud I don't want Bitcoin but no
[39:15] bitcoin's not crypto and Bitcoin is not
[39:17] s bank backman it's a new invention you
[39:20] know so you got to look beyond all that
[39:22] and look at it more seriously so so it's
[39:24] you know just kind of that sort of stuff
[39:26] so um I think it's logically laid out I
[39:28] think it's not too hard to read um and
[39:32] you know the feedback I've gotten so far
[39:33] is yeah it's readable and it's it's
[39:35] probably likely to work with people who
[39:38] wouldn't normally read this kind of
[39:39] thing and that's that's the target
[39:41] audience you know the bitcoiners a like
[39:43] it I'm not worried about that I'm not
[39:45] the book was not actually meant for
[39:46] bitcoiners the book is meant for people
[39:49] who are frustrated with our system you
[39:52] know so it's a orange billing tool it's
[39:54] super interesting um with orange billing
[39:57] I think the the most effective way in
[39:59] Orange pilling people is live a great
[40:01] life and then uh show them that you also
[40:05] love Bitcoin and in that way you kind of
[40:07] imply you make that connection between
[40:09] like he has a great life and he has
[40:11] Bitcoin and make that hero story and
[40:14] also just you know that's why also just
[40:15] just being optimistic and cheerful and
[40:17] happy and recognizing that there is a
[40:19] solution I mean I think it's I think
[40:21] it's important I mean it's it's easy to
[40:24] say you know the monetary system is
[40:25] really broken and to go all Doomer on
[40:27] that I've done that at times but that's
[40:29] that's really not helpful you know
[40:30] nobody wants to hear about how broken
[40:32] the monetary system is and and you know
[40:34] how bad it could be um what people want
[40:36] you know show me the way forward you
[40:38] know give given those given that it's
[40:39] broken what what's the right you know
[40:41] how do I get out of this what do I do
[40:42] how do I make my life better how do I
[40:44] make the world better you know that's
[40:46] that's what it's all about right and so
[40:49] that's the and that's the goal of the
[40:50] book I mean if we if we can get the book
[40:52] to go viral and get a lot of people to
[40:54] read it you know we're going to be able
[40:55] to elect politicians that are going to
[40:57] remove the capital gains tax on bitcoin
[40:59] you know that are going to maybe do a
[41:01] strategic Bitcoin Reserve that you know
[41:03] over time you know maybe Bitcoin becomes
[41:05] you know the dollar becomes backed by
[41:06] Bitcoin I mean I don't know there are a
[41:08] lot of paths we can take but the point
[41:10] is that you know they they in my view
[41:12] they would all make the world a better
[41:14] place and it's it's a great great point
[41:17] that you bring up because like um if you
[41:20] just complain you're complainer but if
[41:22] you show us a solution you a builder
[41:24] you're a visionaire and and I think
[41:25] that's where we we have to that's right
[41:28] and and look you got to put the
[41:30] complaints in there because if you just
[41:31] showed I mean a lot of people just show
[41:32] the solution the solution's great but
[41:34] but you know I mean I think I I think
[41:36] reading the first half a lot of people
[41:38] will be able to relate to the complaints
[41:39] because they felt the pain you know what
[41:42] I mean and and and I you know the the
[41:44] other Advantage I think I bring in
[41:46] writing this book is you know I'm 67 so
[41:48] my age you know you were young you know
[41:50] when all this happened I saw all these
[41:52] moves I saw ltcm I saw you know I've
[41:56] just seen a lot of the bad behavior that
[41:59] got us to where we are now and I try to
[42:01] point that out you know and and because
[42:04] a lot of people have been brainwashed I
[42:05] mean the the cover story from the GFC is
[42:08] all these guys rescued us from a
[42:09] disaster you know and in fact it was a
[42:12] disaster that they created and they got
[42:14] rich off of the rescue so you know it's
[42:17] like and I just I want to just set the
[42:19] record straight on what really happened
[42:21] because I was here and I saw it and I
[42:23] know what went down and so I think it's
[42:26] important that some
[42:27] explained that and explained that you
[42:29] know it wasn't right you
[42:31] know absolutely you said something
[42:34] interesting before you said like the US
[42:36] is in a financial ditch I think
[42:38] something like that um not just the US
[42:41] by the way but I obviously I write from
[42:43] us Centric point of view yeah that was
[42:46] kind of my my question of like like all
[42:48] other countries are in a even bigger
[42:50] ditch absolutely well yes and no I mean
[42:53] some our debt to GDP other than Japan I
[42:56] think our debt to GDP is right up there
[42:57] at the top but yeah some of the European
[42:59] countries are in the same kind of boat
[43:00] and yeah and the problem is a worldwide
[43:03] problem associated with fiat currency I
[43:05] mean no doubt um but I you know
[43:08] obviously I you know I'm a US citizen I
[43:11] live in the US I believe in the US I
[43:12] believe in our our system of government
[43:15] um but I you know sadly I think we've
[43:16] drifted off course and again that's you
[43:19] know one of the points of the book is to
[43:21] try to explain how and why we've drifted
[43:23] off course and you know how maybe we can
[43:26] course correct here I mean you know
[43:28] these bad things and all I mean you know
[43:30] here's the really good news Robin that
[43:32] you know there a lot of other countries
[43:33] have had monetary Mayhem in the past I
[43:35] mean this is not something new
[43:36] especially if you go to smaller
[43:37] countries I mean look at Venezuela or I
[43:40] don't know any hundreds of examples but
[43:43] the here's the story I mean when they
[43:44] return to sound money economies heal
[43:46] quickly I mean all this really broke if
[43:48] we don't get into some big ass War which
[43:50] I don't think we will you know all
[43:52] that's really broken here is the money
[43:54] and you know just we're just operating
[43:55] with a broken system of at money where
[43:57] they're just printing to keep it going
[43:59] and it's just causing inflation we all
[44:00] pay for their mistakes and so you know
[44:03] if we fix the money if we return to a
[44:05] system of sound money I think people
[44:07] would be absolutely shocked at how much
[44:09] better our lives would be and how many
[44:11] other problems would be solved kind of
[44:13] as a corollary to that you know what I
[44:15] mean it's like they're all related
[44:18] so absolutely what do you think about uh
[44:21] Doge not the coin but the government Pro
[44:24] yeah that's a good question well look
[44:27] the US government has a lot of fat in it
[44:29] and I'm I'm I'm all I I applaud any
[44:32] addition any efforts to stop fraud and
[44:34] stop you know the fat and and to cut
[44:36] back expenses um so I'm I you know I
[44:40] hope they succeed okay let's just say
[44:42] that as a general rule having said that
[44:45] um there's a little bit of a halo over
[44:47] this whole thing that you know and look
[44:49] elon's an entrepreneur and he talks big
[44:51] and he makes big projections and he's
[44:53] like yeah we're going to cut $2 billion
[44:54] doll out of the budget and balance the
[44:55] budget right away and I'm kind of like
[44:57] whoa hang on a second not so fast um you
[45:01] know if you look at the federal
[45:03] government budget with 6.75 trillion
[45:05] last year year end of September 80% of
[45:08] that is in Medicare or Social Security
[45:11] Medicare Medicaid defense and interest
[45:14] expense
[45:16] 80% so you know first of all if you cut
[45:18] Social Security Medicare you know that
[45:21] you're going to lose all the Boomer
[45:22] votes and you know they're they're known
[45:24] as the third rail politics because you
[45:26] really can't touch and so that's that's
[45:28] not going to happen interest expense has
[45:30] been going higher because we keep
[45:32] borrowing more so that's going to be
[45:33] hard to get down now they may end up
[45:35] getting it down just because you know
[45:36] Trump maybe a will lean on pow to bring
[45:38] it down but so that's not going to move
[45:40] much the defense budget you know you
[45:42] could probably whack away at that there
[45:43] there's $900 billion do there you can
[45:46] probably cut that back especially if
[45:47] they're able to get some peace deals in
[45:49] certain places but you know those that's
[45:51] a pretty strong entrenched lobby as well
[45:53] so so you're now talking about what
[45:56] remains is like 1.3 trillion the 20% of
[45:59] the last year's spending I mean it's how
[46:02] much you going to cut that I mean you
[46:04] can't take it to zero and the budget
[46:06] deficit run rate just came out last
[46:07] night we are now running at an
[46:09] annualized budget deficit of 2.4
[46:11] trillion a year so you know even if you
[46:15] were to take that one three and take it
[46:16] to zero which you could never do you
[46:18] wouldn't have a court system you would
[46:19] have all kinds of things you know you
[46:21] wouldn't you wouldn't be balancing the
[46:22] budget and this all goes to LY alden's
[46:25] point that kind of Nothing Stops this
[46:26] train I I mean we're just sadly we're
[46:28] just way down the road and very deep in
[46:30] that ditch and the you know the right
[46:33] solution is going to be to do a monetary
[46:34] reset revalue the debt downward in some
[46:37] in terms of something else and and then
[46:39] get back to a more reasonable debt to
[46:42] GDP ratio um but you know that is
[46:46] inflationary there's just no the only
[46:48] you know there's no way that occurs
[46:49] without a big inflationary hit and so
[46:53] again you know the quote unquote the big
[46:55] print and why people need to you know I
[46:59] I Council I'm an investment adviser and
[47:01] I you know I have a lot of clients and
[47:03] and I I say to them you know you need to
[47:05] own things the government can't print
[47:07] because the government's going to print
[47:07] a lot of money in the next 10 years and
[47:10] you know real estate they can't print it
[47:12] gold they can't print it silver they
[47:13] can't print it Bitcoin they can't print
[47:15] it those are the kinds of things you
[47:17] need to own yeah it's it's it's it's ous
[47:19] because in austrial we have kind of a
[47:21] similar debate where they like oh like
[47:23] we we have to fix the budget and we have
[47:25] to give a lot of money out and then
[47:27] uh you're like okay we cut that off all
[47:29] of the sudden this uh group of people
[47:32] don't vote for us anymore because we
[47:33] just took money away from them they are
[47:36] like weird things like a climate bonus
[47:38] in Austria where you just get money
[47:40] every year for for nothing just because
[47:43] you live it's basically helicopter money
[47:45] in in in climate thing um and this they
[47:49] they're thinking about giving away and
[47:50] people are like oh like why don't get
[47:52] the money anymore like yeah like you
[47:54] don't deserve it in the first place yeah
[47:57] right yeah no I mean it's it's always a
[47:59] problem that's Ben Franklin said that
[48:01] about a democracy I mean it works until
[48:03] half the people figure out that they can
[48:05] vote themselves benefits at the expense
[48:06] of the other half and you know it really
[48:09] it becomes a problem yeah I mean that's
[48:12] and that you know it's so we've drifted
[48:13] so far away from the founding documents
[48:15] of the American experiment and which
[48:17] created this great country and that's
[48:19] the other reason I wrote the book you
[48:20] know I've studied American history very
[48:22] carefully and I mean in 1946 this was a
[48:24] great country I mean we we helped one
[48:26] world War II we stood at the top of the
[48:28] world we had all the industrial power
[48:30] you know I would say we were a
[48:31] relatively moral Nation we weren't
[48:32] perfect but you know in general it was
[48:34] just a great country and then things
[48:36] started going wrong slowly at first but
[48:39] then they accelerated over time and you
[48:42] know they were centered around you know
[48:44] the dis economies of having a large
[48:45] government some of the bad things they
[48:47] did and you know the the monetary system
[48:50] deteriorating particularly post 1971 one
[48:53] of my favorite charts in the book is the
[48:54] chart that shows the history of
[48:56] inflation from 1800 to present and it's
[48:59] just kind of stunning how you know there
[49:01] were there were inflations before 1971 I
[49:03] mean each war was inflationary I mean
[49:06] that's one thing we all know is that
[49:07] Wars are inflationary which by the way
[49:09] when we get a deflationary currency the
[49:11] hope is therefore it'll make war less
[49:13] likely so but but anyway going back to
[49:15] the the chart and what it shows is yeah
[49:17] that these little blips of inflation
[49:19] when you have a war but then things go
[49:20] back to normal in 1971 it's just a
[49:22] hockey stick suddenly the curve just
[49:24] started going straight up into the right
[49:26] and and so we've lived in an
[49:28] inflationary age and unless you're my
[49:30] age you're older you don't even know
[49:32] what it's like to live in a
[49:33] non-inflationary age and so um and and
[49:36] that's what keynesianism has done to us
[49:38] and it's wrong I mean it's just it's
[49:39] it's intellectually wrong and so that
[49:42] part there's a part of the book where I
[49:44] really try to strongly make that
[49:45] intellectual argument that you know
[49:48] we're operating on the wrong model you
[49:50] know we we've got we've just got the
[49:51] wrong model and you can't have 12
[49:53] Central Bankers setting the price of
[49:54] money I mean it just doesn't work the
[49:56] price of money should be set in the
[49:57] marketplace by the balancing the supply
[50:00] of of savings against the demand for
[50:02] investment opportunities that's how
[50:04] money you know that's how the the
[50:05] interest rate should be set set but
[50:08] that's not what we have we have 12
[50:09] mandarins who sit in DC and if they if
[50:12] they want to really stop inflation like
[50:14] vulker did that take the rate up to 20%
[50:16] almost bankrupted my father and if they
[50:19] really want to stop a deflationary event
[50:20] they'll take the rate down to 0% which
[50:23] basically makes everyone who can borrow
[50:24] at 0% a billionaire you know but the
[50:27] average person obviously doesn't have
[50:29] that benefit the average person has to
[50:30] borrow against the credit cards at 25%
[50:33] so look there's been you know the system
[50:35] is very very broken and sadly tilted
[50:38] against the interests of the average
[50:41] American and the average person really
[50:43] worldwide and and that's just it's just
[50:45] not right it's not fair it's not right
[50:48] and and you know by the way to the
[50:50] degree we do live in a representative
[50:52] democracy or representative Republic you
[50:54] know there are a lot more of us who want
[50:55] to have a fair system than there are the
[50:57] people who benefit from the unfair
[50:59] system so if we if we educate everybody
[51:02] we ought to be able to vote them out of
[51:03] office and you know return to a fair
[51:05] system that's that's the dream you know
[51:08] now will we achieve that I'm not sure
[51:10] you know I've been working at it for a
[51:12] long time and it's been hard and I can't
[51:14] you know I can't guarantee that it's
[51:16] going to succeed but we're trying yeah
[51:17] like as you said before the biggest uh
[51:20] problem is like the depth and the
[51:21] interest rate on that and like Doge and
[51:24] like cutting government spending it can
[51:27] only do so much because they the
[51:29] probably was made in in the last 50
[51:31] years yeah yeah we're deep in the hole I
[51:33] mean the US is 36 trillion of debt going
[51:35] to 37 you know the deficit last year was
[51:38] 18 this year it'll be higher and and the
[51:40] debt actually goes up more than the
[51:41] deficit somehow we're spending money off
[51:43] Bal off income statement so I think the
[51:45] debt increase like 2.4 last year even
[51:47] though the deficit was only one8 so you
[51:50] know you just keep adding three or four
[51:51] trillion dollars to the debt every year
[51:53] and this is the Doom Loop right I mean
[51:55] that debt has to be service there's
[51:56] interest that has to be paid on it I
[51:59] mean seven or eight years ago the
[52:00] interest on the US federal debt was you
[52:01] know 300 billion a year now I've seen
[52:03] the Run rate is 1.4 trillion that's a
[52:06] huge we're spending more on interest
[52:08] expense on the debt than we spent on the
[52:10] military and it's getting close to what
[52:12] we spend on social security so you know
[52:15] it's just a real problem and so we've
[52:17] got to have some kind of a reset or debt
[52:19] Jubilee uh or or or the alternative is
[52:22] we just won't be able to service it and
[52:23] things will collapse
[52:25] so yeah uh how does this reset would
[52:30] look like it's almost like the the
[52:32] second book uh that the great reset
[52:34] after the the big print yeah yeah maybe
[52:37] maybe I mean it's there that's a long
[52:40] long discussion and a long story I mean
[52:43] at a miniature level you know Roosevelt
[52:45] did it in 33 when he grabbed the gold
[52:47] and then re devalued the gold against
[52:49] the dollar I mean that was a you know
[52:51] they were in massive deflation in 33 and
[52:53] so they tried to basically they used
[52:55] they reset the dollar lower against gold
[52:58] which was an inflationary act to try and
[53:00] get you know inflation going again and
[53:02] it worked in 34 things did pretty well
[53:04] actually so um you know but it's
[53:07] something like that but on a larger
[53:08] scale it's actually talked about in
[53:10] great length in the book and it's the
[53:11] very hardest part of the whole puzzle to
[53:13] sort out how it's going to play out but
[53:16] you know it's interesting because Scott
[53:18] bassent the new treasury secretary has
[53:19] indicated in the speech last June that
[53:22] he he understands he he gets the problem
[53:25] he's a he's a financial guy sees the way
[53:27] I see it and he um you know he he said
[53:30] in a speech last June you know there may
[53:32] be some need for some kind of a monetary
[53:34] conference that that looks similar to uh
[53:36] you know what we did in Brenton Woods in
[53:38] 1944 and if it's true that we do that I
[53:41] want to be at the table so so you know
[53:43] there there are people who in the US who
[53:45] are kind of aware of and thinking about
[53:47] this issue but you know how is it going
[53:49] to play out none of us know and it's
[53:51] very hard to tell I mean there have been
[53:53] some whisperings that maybe they're
[53:54] going to revalue Gold higher I mean they
[53:56] he also also recently said something
[53:58] along the lines of you know we've got
[54:00] assets that we can you know that we can
[54:01] utilize and monetize and and the only
[54:04] one that really jumps out at me since
[54:06] we're not going to sell Yellowstone Park
[54:07] is you know we could maybe revalue the
[54:10] Gold stock higher and so that's one
[54:12] possible form of reset so you know it's
[54:14] it's hard to say uh we'll just have to
[54:16] wait and see how it all unfolds but um
[54:20] interesting times for sure at least in
[54:22] the monetary world you know we just also
[54:25] uh kind of one other big question is
[54:29] like not only how will it end the Fe
[54:32] system but how will uh how big of a
[54:35] thing will Bitcoin be once it's on the
[54:37] other side like what's the full
[54:38] potential of Bitcoin is Bitcoin like
[54:40] that that's that's a whole I think it's
[54:43] GNA blow people's minds I mean I think
[54:44] you know I mean sailor says 10 or 17
[54:47] million I mean I yeah I think it's gonna
[54:49] I mean it's going to be millions and
[54:50] millions of dollars a coin and and you
[54:53] know it um but that that's not tomorrow
[54:57] you know this is a there'll be a
[54:58] there'll be a progression as we move
[55:00] from here to there but it is going to
[55:02] melt faces I mean I I think you know
[55:04] people are going to be stunned I mean I
[55:06] think there are people who are stunned
[55:07] now I mean I know a lot of people were
[55:08] like when it went from 60 70 to 20 they
[55:11] thought okay that's it it's over or 15
[55:14] but you know now here it is it's back
[55:15] again and going to new all time of 100
[55:17] it's causing them to rethink their their
[55:19] initial their prior skepticism I mean it
[55:21] just it is like the Energizer Bunny it
[55:23] just keeps up and keep and keeps going
[55:25] higher even though you can knock it down
[55:26] and it comes back at you so uh you know
[55:30] I look I wouldn't bet against it I
[55:32] wouldn't short it um Shing Bitcoin seems
[55:35] dangerous these days yeah I so yeah you
[55:39] mentioned before uh like one one more
[55:41] topic I want to get in before we get to
[55:43] the end routine of the podcast um uh you
[55:45] mentioned before the the the stories
[55:48] that you try to hook people uh do you
[55:49] have a favorite story in in the book
[55:52] where from what you explain so I think
[55:55] it might be available on am on the
[55:56] preview I mean I there was a conference
[55:58] there was a monetary conference at HBS
[56:00] where the guys who had done this the
[56:03] 2008 uh GFC came back to kind of Pat
[56:06] themselves on the back and say how what
[56:08] they did was right and righteous and
[56:10] they had to do it and all that kind of
[56:11] stuff and they asked if anyone disagreed
[56:13] with their point of view and I was in
[56:15] the audience and there were three or 4
[56:16] hundred of us and I raised my hand I
[56:18] said yeah I disagree and I I mean it was
[56:21] talk about being kind of the turd and
[56:22] the punch bowl you know that was me I I
[56:24] had 350 Angry Star
[56:27] and and then maybe a few people
[56:29] afterwards that came up to me and said
[56:30] right on you you know you had the guts
[56:32] to call them out on the so uh
[56:35] uh yeah let's see is it does it have
[56:38] it's opening scene does it yeah opening
[56:40] scene exactly it has the opening
[56:42] scene that's a hook right I'm trying to
[56:45] you know I'm trying to get people to um
[56:48] you know just kind of and I think you
[56:50] know you read that you realize hey this
[56:52] guy's not just an ordinary guy right I
[56:53] mean he you know um got guts and and and
[56:57] I see it differently than the
[56:58] establishment sees it and I'm willing to
[57:00] call them out on it so um I I think some
[57:04] the feedback I've gotten is that that
[57:05] was a good hook to get people think oh
[57:08] that's interesting maybe I should
[57:09] continue reading what this guy has to
[57:10] say you know and that's why I put it up
[57:12] front my my uh editor and book agent
[57:15] both recommended hey I had it buried
[57:17] back in somewhere in the book no no no
[57:19] you got to lead with this because this
[57:21] is the kind of thing that causes people
[57:22] to go oh that's interesting I'll keep
[57:24] reading you know I mean the real trick
[57:26] with a book I mean many people you know
[57:27] a lot of books just don't get read I
[57:29] mean people don't read that much anymore
[57:30] which by the way I want to mention we've
[57:32] got an audible version coming it'll be
[57:33] out very soon so I've had a lot of
[57:35] requests for audible we're working on it
[57:37] um it's not going to be me sadly I'm too
[57:38] busy Walker America is going to read it
[57:40] but he's got a great voice he'll do a
[57:41] good job um but yeah so the you know the
[57:44] notion is to um you know try and get try
[57:47] and get people hooked and then you know
[57:49] I mean I I was very pleased I saw a
[57:51] review some guy said hey this thing
[57:52] reads like a Tom Clancy Thriller I don't
[57:54] think it's that good but but you know
[57:57] other people said you know I read the
[57:59] first 20 or 30 pages I couldn't put it
[58:00] down that's what I'm looking for right
[58:02] because you know look monetary economics
[58:05] is a pretty dry subject and getting the
[58:07] average working person to want to read
[58:09] about you know what you know the details
[58:10] of the Federal Reserve and the broken
[58:12] monetary system that's a pretty big lift
[58:14] I mean it's hard to get the average
[58:15] person to give a but if you make it
[58:18] interesting and you tell the stories and
[58:19] you show where the bones are buried you
[58:21] know then people are kind of like they
[58:23] might end up reading something about
[58:24] monetary economics that they didn't even
[58:25] realize was about monetary economics
[58:27] because there were all these other fun
[58:28] stories in there so so that's kind of
[58:31] why I did it that way that will be fun
[58:33] uh weric because uh I I I did a podcast
[58:36] with him and uh it's the only podcast
[58:38] enough like I forgot to mention that you
[58:41] actually my 400 episode today uh I
[58:45] wanted to open with that but I forgot it
[58:47] uh any anyways um and he was the only
[58:50] one that got a lot of replies of like
[58:52] Bitcoin esmr like he has a great voice
[58:54] like uh walk is I think the the best one
[58:57] of the best in Bitcoin those things I
[59:00] certainly think he is he's a great guy
[59:01] and I love him and his wife so yeah so
[59:05] it you know look I mean all I would say
[59:07] to people listening to this people
[59:08] watching is is please support it if you
[59:10] can um not because I'm trying to make
[59:11] money out them but because I'm trying to
[59:12] change the world and uh you know if you
[59:15] please take the time to read it because
[59:16] I I put a lot of work into it and and
[59:19] then I think once you do that I think
[59:20] you might conclude this is a really good
[59:22] tool you know if I have people in my
[59:24] family or my extended life that are
[59:27] skeptical on bitcoin um this I I think
[59:30] you know immodestly I'll say I think
[59:31] this might be the best book for bringing
[59:33] them in you know I mean the other books
[59:35] are great but they're they're not
[59:37] they're not what this is this is a you
[59:39] know this is a story told in a way to
[59:42] suck people into Bitcoin and get them to
[59:44] understand it um and so I hope it does
[59:47] that you know I tried and uh uh and and
[59:50] as you know as we all know if we want to
[59:52] make the world a better place we got to
[59:54] move to a Bitcoin standard and and the
[59:55] way we do that is just kind of one
[59:57] convert at a time and and it's happening
[59:59] look it would have happened without this
[60:01] book but you know I wanted to you know
[60:04] my view is I want it to happen faster
[60:05] because I want I know things will be
[60:07] better once we get there and I want that
[60:09] better world to appear sooner rather
[60:11] than later because we all have a limited
[60:13] time frame I want my kids to have a
[60:14] better world etc etc so and as a guy who
[60:18] who lives on platforms like YouTube uh I
[60:21] know also how important on Amazon like
[60:23] reviews and stuff like that is so like
[60:25] also uh for all people are very kind
[60:27] I've gotten a lot of reviews so far but
[60:29] you know compared to the number I've
[60:30] sold the review still seems a little bit
[60:32] light so I again I if if you did like it
[60:35] and you want to help out you know wri in
[60:36] a nice review would be quote unquote
[60:39] doing your part do you know what I mean
[60:40] everybody you know it's proof of work I
[60:42] mean I I did Proof of work to write the
[60:43] book I mean you know every every little
[60:46] bit counts and if we if we just keep
[60:47] spreading the word you know we're gonna
[60:49] we're going to convert the whole world
[60:51] and and you know we'll all benefit from
[60:53] number goes up but but really the bigger
[60:55] thing I think we Ben from his his War
[60:57] goes away that's that's to me the
[60:59] biggest issue you know when the
[61:00] governments can't pay for these wars
[61:01] they're not going to have any wars and
[61:03] uh I like that that's a really good
[61:06] thing yeah and we we kind of have to
[61:08] like there are uh big voices like
[61:10] yourself like Michael like siphoning and
[61:12] all those those people in there and we
[61:14] kind of have to push them out and make
[61:17] them visible outside of Bitcoin and I
[61:19] think that's what we can do with that
[61:21] book also like to push it outside like I
[61:24] would you know I would kill to get on
[61:26] Rogan or something do you know what I
[61:27] mean or I mean we just we've got to get
[61:29] you know order to get on CNBC I mean
[61:31] we've just got to get out of the Bitcoin
[61:33] Echo chamber and the bitcoiners will
[61:35] love this book I'm not worried about
[61:36] that that's not that's not the target
[61:39] that's not the target audience the
[61:40] target audience is average Americans you
[61:42] know really average people around the
[61:44] world but the target audience is is just
[61:46] somebody who's working hard and doesn't
[61:48] understand why they're getting screwed
[61:49] by inflation and wants to have a
[61:51] solution to that and wants to and and by
[61:54] in a subsidiary way make world a better
[61:56] place once they once they adopt that
[61:58] solution so it's you win on two levels
[62:01] right yeah and and I was I'm a Dar CEO
[62:06] fan uh also and the only guy that was on
[62:10] talking about Bitcoin was how is the guy
[62:12] called rul Paulo or something like that
[62:14] like I was so disappointed and like
[62:17] there so many great people in Bitcoin
[62:18] and then he he's the one that goes on
[62:21] that so that's what I was also trying
[62:24] like we have to push the right people
[62:25] people like yourself like Michael like J
[62:27] males like uh Jeff Bo like CER like
[62:30] there's so many great voices that can be
[62:32] on a chogan or like on a a dive of Zo
[62:35] and then they have we really yeah it's
[62:39] it's sad that there's still crypto
[62:41] people around it's sad that some of them
[62:42] have a platform it's sad that some of
[62:44] them me you know they muddle our message
[62:47] I mean it's you know big we've got to
[62:49] try and keep it to bitcoin and the
[62:51] Bitcoin maximalists in my view because I
[62:53] think that you know we're we're
[62:55] addressing the most fundamental issue
[62:57] which is the broken monetary system and
[63:00] uh you know all those other things are
[63:02] they're confusion and and and sadly
[63:04] there you know there's a lot of hurt I
[63:06] mean I I know a lot of people who had
[63:07] money at FTX they lost all their money
[63:09] you know I mean and and I you know and
[63:11] so and and therefore their friends heard
[63:14] that story and they're just like hell
[63:15] I'm never touching that you know I
[63:18] get it I I completely get it but you
[63:21] know all I would say is you know just
[63:23] maybe buy my book come back give it
[63:25] another chance think about what this
[63:26] technical Innovation represents and you
[63:29] know reconsider I mean I I never give up
[63:32] I mean a lot of my gold bug friends
[63:34] don't believe in it and I just I don't
[63:35] get mad at them I don't give up on I
[63:37] just kind of keep chipping away at them
[63:38] because and I've had and I've converted
[63:40] a lot of them but you know initially
[63:43] they were extremely skeptical and and
[63:45] even angry um but I just I just try to
[63:47] stay calm I hang on a second guys think
[63:50] this thing through you know and and and
[63:52] you know I mean it's I mean and and that
[63:55] by the way that tracks kind of my view
[63:57] of it I mean you know in 2014 I wasn't
[63:59] convinced this thing was going to
[64:00] replace gold I thought it was
[64:02] interesting and I thought it might work
[64:03] but I wasn't sure and you know obviously
[64:06] as you learn more do more see more years
[64:07] unfold see problems get resolved you
[64:10] know you kind of get more and more
[64:11] confidence that yes indeed this really
[64:13] is what it promises it's got to you know
[64:15] this is likely to be the base layer of
[64:17] money in 15 or 20 years and so therefore
[64:20] participating now is is you know from an
[64:22] investment point of view is a smart
[64:24] thing to do why would think get angry do
[64:26] they feel threatened by by Bitcoin like
[64:29] yeah maybe I mean I there a lot of gold
[64:30] people who are sore that you know that
[64:32] they I mean like Peter Shi for example I
[64:34] mean that they they understood the
[64:36] problems just like we do um and they
[64:37] understood them a long time ago long
[64:39] before bitcoiners came around and mean I
[64:41] get their frustration I mean some
[64:42] bitcoiners act like they invented sound
[64:44] money you know and and it's kind like no
[64:48] guys U before Bitcoin existed there was
[64:50] a whole crowd of us fighting for this
[64:52] for 25 or 30 years you know fighting for
[64:54] a return to the gold stand so don't just
[64:57] dismiss those people they're they're on
[64:58] your side now but you know a lot of them
[65:01] got very locked into to that one thing
[65:03] of gold and and they couldn't accept
[65:05] that there could maybe be a technical
[65:07] Innovation that would be a better form
[65:08] of gold which you know I call Bitcoin
[65:10] digital gold I mean you know Bitcoin is
[65:13] is is digital sound money and gold is
[65:15] analog sound money and so you know some
[65:19] people just haven't been able to make
[65:20] that intellectual leap some people put
[65:22] it in the crypto fraud bucket I mean
[65:24] there there are all kinds of reasons why
[65:26] you know the people can't get from one
[65:28] to the other but but I but it's
[65:30] interesting as I say I I've noticed that
[65:32] over time if I'm if I you know if I'm
[65:35] open-minded cheerful don't criticize
[65:37] them and just keep trying to explain it
[65:40] you know a lot of the gold bugs that I
[65:42] know they they kind of evolve they're
[65:43] and they're like gosh you know what I
[65:45] think he's right I recently had a friend
[65:47] who was kind of against it and uh you
[65:49] know in the last few years he's kind of
[65:51] like no I you know I get it and he's
[65:53] buying it and he's selling his gold to
[65:54] buy Bitcoin so that and that happens
[65:57] that's happened to me a lot so um excuse
[66:01] me for it's kind of kind of interesting
[66:04] I also had a lot of um friends and
[66:07] colleagues in the last five years that
[66:09] they switch from completely against it
[66:11] to like kind of liking it so like that
[66:13] those developments are possible because
[66:15] a lot of people are I think in Bitcoin
[66:16] are a little bit um frustrated sometimes
[66:19] with their environments and I think give
[66:21] it time and I think they come around if
[66:24] you don't piss them off absolutely and
[66:26] and and as you and I both know you know
[66:28] you get them in a little bit they
[66:29] possibly like it and then they read more
[66:31] and they study it more and then the
[66:32] price goes up and they see how it's
[66:33] working and you know pretty soon you got
[66:35] yourself a full-fledged they're doing
[66:36] podcast you got yourself a full-fledged
[66:38] Bitcoin art you know what I mean I mean
[66:40] it's all of us I mean I remember being
[66:42] with Max Kaiser years and years ago and
[66:44] and I was a supporter of Bitcoin but I
[66:46] was still in the gold Camp too and he
[66:48] said gosh it sounds like you're getting
[66:49] a little bit more orange pilled and I
[66:51] said yeah I am Max but I'm still gold
[66:53] and he's like okay he said he said
[66:55] that'll F away and I said well maybe but
[66:57] he was right you know I mean he kind of
[66:59] knew he could you could just kind of see
[67:00] the evolution you know from okay you
[67:03] know Gold's good uh and Gold's not bad
[67:06] don't get me wrong gold gold is fine at
[67:07] predicting purchasing power it's just
[67:08] not going to keep up with Bitcoin it's
[67:11] just not you know the alpha on gold is
[67:13] just the fraction of the alpha on
[67:14] bitcoin so I like seeing the Bitcoin
[67:17] price determined in Gold I think that's
[67:20] a way better chart to look chart yeah
[67:21] it's a very good chart yeah I mean it's
[67:23] sadly Gold's losing out but
[67:26] it is what it is I mean it's you know
[67:27] the bitcoin's got the adoption curve
[67:29] going on Gold's been around 5,000 years
[67:30] anyone that wants to own gold knows
[67:32] about it and already owns it you know
[67:34] the with Bitcoin every year we get new
[67:37] bitcoiners and and by the way you know
[67:39] gold Supply is growing slowly 1.7% a
[67:42] year Bitcoin is growing at 8% a year cut
[67:45] getting cut in half every four years but
[67:47] the you know the Bitcoin we know the
[67:49] model the Bitcoin total amount is fixed
[67:52] and that's a huge huge deal and
[67:54] therefore you you know there's there's
[67:56] really no limit to how high the price
[67:57] can go in Fiat terms and then eventually
[67:59] the Fiat will kind of disappear and you
[68:01] know everything will be quoted in
[68:02] Satoshi so I mean I see that coming I
[68:06] just don't know the time frame I I think
[68:07] it's 15 20 years you know at the
[68:10] most absolutely H really cool I have one
[68:13] question to ask each and every one of my
[68:14] guests and I asked it already last time
[68:17] um I think you said to the question like
[68:19] staying fit or CrossFit or something
[68:21] like that the question is what can we
[68:22] learn from you what can we learn from
[68:24] you besides Bitcoin
[68:26] since I gave that answer last time I
[68:28] don't give another one I mean I um you
[68:30] know alcohol is a
[68:32] coin nice I stopped drinking about 35
[68:35] years ago and and you know I'm 67 but I
[68:37] don't look it um and so uh and my
[68:40] friends who drink heavily don't look you
[68:42] know don't look their age they look
[68:43] older so uh just be another piece of
[68:46] advice I mean I my all my kids drink a
[68:49] little bit but I've given them all this
[68:51] advice and I think you know it's fine in
[68:53] your 20s and maybe okay A bit in your
[68:55] 30s but most of us who've gone dry uh
[68:58] don't ever look back don't ever regret
[69:00] it and so I you know anybody drinks um I
[69:03] just highly recommend it but obviously
[69:05] if people want to drink and drink
[69:06] responsible that's fine I don't care I'm
[69:07] not I'm not AUD about it I'm just saying
[69:09] that for me in my life it's worked
[69:11] really great to to be dry and I just
[69:13] never have to worry about it never have
[69:14] to think about it you know and if I were
[69:16] to taste it now it tastes awful you know
[69:18] it's poison so um yeah just another you
[69:22] know piece of advice I guess absolutely
[69:24] really cool
[69:25] let's see what we get in the the third
[69:27] round yeah exactly um we we have also
[69:30] nro the last question of the podcast
[69:33] always uh was from the previous guest
[69:35] ask a question for you without KN who
[69:37] you are which really interesting also
[69:40] fitting one for today uh which book has
[69:42] influenced you personally the most well
[69:46] I'd have to say the Bitcoin standard I
[69:47] mean I think it's the best book ever
[69:49] written on bitcoin but I would say it's
[69:51] a close tie between that one and the
[69:53] fourth turning by how and Strauss um for
[69:55] those who aren't familiar the fourth
[69:56] turning is a mo a Model A sociological
[69:59] model of how societies evolve and change
[70:03] and it suggests that every 80 years you
[70:05] have a crisis that gets resolved and I
[70:06] think we're in a fourth turning the one
[70:08] before this was World War II the one
[70:10] before that was a Civil War the one
[70:11] before that was the American Revolution
[70:13] and I think this forth turning the issue
[70:15] that's going to get solved is is Robert
[70:16] bries what is money you know that the
[70:19] money and banking system is wrong it's
[70:21] broken it's built on a fault faulty
[70:24] model kin M and as a result of that um
[70:29] you know we've got to fix it and so I
[70:31] think that book it that book just helped
[70:32] me to really understand why we're in the
[70:35] cycle that we're in right now um and
[70:37] then safe book was really what cemented
[70:40] me being orange pilled you know just um
[70:43] completely explaining AUST I mean I knew
[70:45] Austrian economics but not as well as I
[70:47] did after I finished reading safe's book
[70:49] so that's kind of that's that's the must
[70:51] read as you go down the rabbit hole in
[70:53] my view absolutely it was also my orange
[70:55] pilling book really cool um really cool
[70:58] perfect then uh I usually ask where
[71:01] where where people can find you but uh I
[71:03] already showed the book I think that's
[71:04] the most yeah I'm on I'm on Twitter
[71:06] Lawrence leard um let me just say if I
[71:08] can I can just put in a plug um I'm
[71:09] involved in a fund called the Bitcoin
[71:11] opportunity fund which does public and
[71:13] private Bitcoin investing we owned a lot
[71:15] of micro strategy last year had a great
[71:16] year we're up 64% they raising you know
[71:20] I say they because I'm not a managing
[71:21] partner I'm an advisory partner they're
[71:23] raising Capital right now and uh so
[71:25] anyone who's a qualified investor can
[71:27] reach out on that yeah but it's um yeah
[71:30] and I'll I'll be on Twitter making a lot
[71:31] of noise I'll also just tell you anyone
[71:33] who buys the book I'm happy to sign your
[71:35] book for free obviously um at at any of
[71:37] the shows I'm at I'm I'm going to be in
[71:39] pubkey in a couple weeks in New York
[71:41] City um and that's on my Twitter thing
[71:44] I'm going to be at bit boach boom I'm G
[71:46] to be at the Las Vegas show I'm going to
[71:48] be in Prague and I just made a
[71:49] commitment to go up to uh um what's the
[71:53] one in Bedford what's uh cheat code
[71:55] uh Peter Peter's event up in Bedford
[71:58] England so in April so um so I know I'll
[72:01] be at those shows and please come up say
[72:02] hello happy to sign your book I'll
[72:05] eventually be selling signed copies of
[72:06] the book but I I I got to set up the
[72:08] website I mean I got way too many things
[72:10] to do um I also I will eventually make
[72:13] make it available in bulk at a cheaper
[72:16] rate so if you want to buy it and give
[72:17] it to your church or something or buy it
[72:19] and give it to your friends but that's
[72:20] that's a little ways down the road as
[72:22] well the you know I don't have the
[72:23] system in place to do that right yet so
[72:26] yeah like the orange pilling packages
[72:29] forly exactly so and it'll ultimately
[72:32] it'll be a TR that's the other thing it
[72:33] will be translated into other languages
[72:35] probably Spanish is the first on the
[72:37] list um but again that's you know that's
[72:39] going to take time I mean I'm just
[72:41] literally the book is a week old right
[72:42] now so uh we're still kind of very early
[72:45] days it's selling well but I I wish it
