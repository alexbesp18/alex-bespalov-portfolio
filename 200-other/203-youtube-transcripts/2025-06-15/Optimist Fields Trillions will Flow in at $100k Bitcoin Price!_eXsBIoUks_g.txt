[00:00] once we start breaking the six figure
[00:02] price range I think a new fomo range and
[00:04] a new fomo wave of people are going to
[00:07] get into Bitcoin it almost does feel
[00:09] like Cycles might be breaking we might
[00:12] be on the verge of seeing a money
[00:14] printer to buy Bitcoin and if that
[00:16] happens the currencies are nuked and
[00:18] Bitcoin is going up forever I'm the most
[00:19] bullish on bitcoin I'm overly bullish to
[00:22] my own detriment a lot and it does feel
[00:24] like we might hit a million dollars this
[00:26] year I'm just very excited to see what
[00:28] happens in 2025 like how high can we run
[00:31] we've Meed Bitcoin to 100K we're going
[00:33] to meme it to a million bitcoin's been
[00:35] in a bull market since 2009 for the last
[00:38] 15 years it's constantly in a bull
[00:40] market it's going up forever we know
[00:42] bitcoin's been adopted faster than the
[00:44] internet telephone and other
[00:46] Technologies in the world if politicians
[00:48] fight Bitcoin they might not end up in
[00:50] office we are battling a trillion plus
[00:53] dollar scop campaign against the truth I
[00:55] really do believe that what we're doing
[00:58] is super important and trying to wake
[01:00] people up trying to show people that
[01:02] there is an alternative and they don't
[01:04] have to live this meager existence where
[01:07] you know you're living paycheck to
[01:08] paycheck and you can barely pay rent
[01:10] Bitcoin saved my life legitimately full
[01:12] stop saved my
[01:13] [Music]
[01:17] life I really check the price too much I
[01:20] don't know how is it about you yeah I
[01:23] mean hey everyone that says they don't
[01:25] care about the price is lying because
[01:27] when the price starts ripping we all
[01:29] care about the price absolutely and I
[01:32] think we can just directly start in with
[01:34] that because H it's it's really
[01:36] interesting for me that that the 100K
[01:38] that we almost are there and uh I'm in
[01:41] that great position that I got
[01:44] interested in Bitcoin under 10k
[01:46] unfortunately I only TI my do and there
[01:49] I really would wish that I really
[01:51] splashed in there right under 10k but I
[01:54] was not in that position uh and now
[01:57] we're at 100K it just feels completely
[01:59] unreal thing that we talked about uh
[02:01] years ago like three four years ago that
[02:04] might happen um H what is the impact do
[02:07] you think once we actually hit the 100K
[02:10] and maybe we even hit it on the stream
[02:11] let's see uh how the next hour goes uh
[02:15] yeah I mean personally like I'm I'm with
[02:17] you 100% I also came into Bitcoin around
[02:20] the 10K actually in 2017 when Bitcoin
[02:23] hit 10K for the first time I heard I was
[02:26] seeing Bitcoin like six times that day
[02:29] and that was like the you know the
[02:32] signal at the time to actually check it
[02:34] out obviously I heard about Bitcoin in
[02:36] the past and you know I just kind of
[02:38] ignored it but when I heard about
[02:39] Bitcoin at 10K and I saw it I think it
[02:41] was like six times throughout the day
[02:43] you know I just kept catching flashes of
[02:45] it throughout the day it really kind of
[02:47] pequ my interest and obviously at that
[02:49] point like I wasn't making much money
[02:52] life wasn't like I wasn't in a good
[02:54] position in my life right like I was
[02:55] looking for answers I was kind of going
[02:58] through like a weird breakup at the the
[02:59] time so I was like kind of at a low
[03:01] point in my life right and then I saw
[03:03] this 10K thing and at the time actually
[03:05] like going back a little bit like three
[03:07] months or so before I kind of got the
[03:10] like bug of oh wait like if I want to
[03:14] actually have something in my future
[03:15] maybe I should buy stocks and I remember
[03:17] walking into Charles Schwab and they
[03:20] basically laugh me out of the out of the
[03:21] building they're like haha like you need
[03:24] $2,500 to even open an account here and
[03:26] I'm like what like I have like $250 like
[03:29] this the whole point like this is before
[03:31] Robin Hood was like a a thing you know
[03:33] so there wasn't this just like throw a
[03:35] little bit of cash and get exposure to
[03:37] the stocks yet that's kind of like the
[03:39] 2018 era of investing and I literally
[03:42] got laughed out of Charles Schwab
[03:44] anyways you know fast forward three
[03:45] months Bitcoin hits 10K and that kind of
[03:48] peak my interest into Bitcoin and I
[03:50] watched a couple Andreas Antonopoulos
[03:52] videos and as the saying goes you know
[03:55] the rest is history and anyway just kind
[03:57] of using my own story I think that's
[04:01] kind of what we're going to see at 100K
[04:03] obviously for us bitcoiners 100K is like
[04:05] a huge psychological number it's a big
[04:08] round number it's probably going to make
[04:11] all the noise in all of the corporate
[04:13] press and it really feels like the fomo
[04:16] from retail again we this time is a
[04:18] little different in regards to retail in
[04:20] 2017 you know free money was flowing
[04:22] everyone had cash like it felt like good
[04:25] times you know everyone's like let me
[04:27] just throw money at things and and
[04:29] hopefully I get more money now might be
[04:31] a little different because of inflation
[04:34] people are starting to feel the crunch
[04:35] in their in their pocketbooks and so
[04:37] maybe we won't have the retail fomo at
[04:40] least right now because people don't
[04:42] have as much free flowing cash and it
[04:44] seems like a lot of people are living
[04:46] paycheck to paycheck working two jobs
[04:48] just to survive so that might be a
[04:50] little caveat here but it does feel like
[04:52] 100k is a psychological price point and
[04:55] once we break that 100K and start moving
[04:58] into six fig Bitcoin it really does feel
[05:00] like the fomo is going to kick in
[05:02] obviously you know Trump just got
[05:04] elected it looks like the new incoming
[05:07] Administration in the US is kicking off
[05:09] this like Global hash War the global
[05:11] Game Theory the fomo that is playing out
[05:13] afterwards and the ripples that have
[05:15] been that's been happening since Trump
[05:18] kind of announced this Pro crypto
[05:20] Administration we're seeing it start to
[05:22] play out you know in in Russia they
[05:24] started to Legal legalize Bitcoin mining
[05:27] they're talking about using Bitcoin
[05:29] businesses to business you know it's
[05:31] still kind of not so much for retail
[05:33] we're seeing kind of China backflip on
[05:36] their stance on bitcoin there was a big
[05:39] Shanghai court case or a court reading
[05:41] this week saying that like it's legal
[05:43] for Chinese citizens to hold Bitcoin
[05:46] obviously El Salvador and naib B is just
[05:50] leading the charge on that they're doing
[05:52] really well they're stacking a lot of
[05:53] Bitcoin we got the kingdom of Bhutan
[05:56] with I I forget what the numbers is but
[05:58] their GDP is like 2. billion and their
[06:01] Bitcoin holding is currently at like1
[06:04] something billion dollars so it looks
[06:07] like their GDP is going to get dwarfed
[06:09] by just their Bitcoin mining Holdings
[06:12] and so it does feel like the game theory
[06:14] is playing out everyone is having to
[06:17] look at Bitcoin like a legitimate
[06:18] investment it's maturing you know
[06:20] politics is landing on our door and I
[06:22] really do think that breaking 100k with
[06:25] conviction and who knows maybe we kiss
[06:28] it today and then it kind of
[06:30] consolidates but once it actually breaks
[06:32] 100K I really do think that there's
[06:34] going to be a whole new fomo wave coming
[06:36] and of course wall Street's getting
[06:38] interested in Bitcoin so these
[06:40] psychological numbers even though most
[06:42] Bitcoin like I I don't know if we're
[06:43] going to put the part where I just said
[06:45] like most of us bitcoiners claim to not
[06:47] care about the price and then once the
[06:48] price starts running we're all watching
[06:50] the price and so I feel like that's kind
[06:53] of how things play out like bitcoin
[06:56] price going up for better or worse is
[06:58] how most people get locked into Bitcoin
[07:00] you know as the saying goes you come for
[07:02] the money and you come to F and then you
[07:04] stay to fix the money and I think that's
[07:06] what we're going to see with a 100K
[07:08] obviously as bitcoiners where I mean
[07:11] personally me and I'm sure you're the
[07:12] same way I am bull tarded as they comes
[07:15] I'm the most bullish on bitcoin I'm
[07:17] overly bullish to my own detriment a lot
[07:20] and it does feel like you know there's
[07:22] been a been a lot of a lot of
[07:24] speculation from a lot of Bitcoin ogs
[07:27] that like maybe we might hit a million
[07:29] dollars this year that still seems a bit
[07:30] outlandish to me but it does seem like
[07:34] things have changed and once we start
[07:36] breaking the six figure price range you
[07:38] know that psychological trigger of a
[07:41] $100,000 Bitcoin which bitcoiners have
[07:43] been talking about for you know 10 years
[07:46] plus once we break it with conviction I
[07:49] think a new fomo range and a new fomo
[07:51] like wave of people are going to get
[07:54] into Bitcoin and now it's not just
[07:56] retail you know it's going to be Wall
[07:58] Street it's be nation states it's going
[08:01] to be the biggest institutional managers
[08:03] of the world it's going to be retail so
[08:06] I think this year 2024 has been one of
[08:09] those years of laying the foundation for
[08:11] catapulting into you know maybe the
[08:14] s-curve adoption of Bitcoin that we've
[08:15] kind of been talking about for a long
[08:17] time like I hate saying uh super cycle
[08:20] is here because I'm wrong all the time
[08:23] but it almost does feel like Cycles
[08:26] might be breaking like it almost seems
[08:28] like this time is fundamentally
[08:30] different if the US does acknowledge
[08:32] Bitcoin put it on their strategic
[08:34] Reserve stockpile Etc and other
[08:36] countries follow suit like we might be
[08:39] on the verge of seeing a money printer
[08:41] you know to buy Bitcoin and if that
[08:43] happens like Fiat currencies are nuked
[08:45] and Bitcoin is going up forever as the
[08:47] meme goes you know everything divided by
[08:49] 21 million Bitcoin has no top because
[08:51] Fiat has no bottom it's like at this
[08:54] point I still I've been joking like at
[08:57] this point I'm still kind of dead inside
[08:58] like I've expected 100K for a long time
[09:01] so I'm not that excited but I I can feel
[09:04] the excitement starting to bubble inside
[09:06] me and I'm like I'm GNA lose my mind
[09:08] like this 2025 I'm G to be losing my
[09:10] mind every single day on the stream and
[09:13] uh I just hope that I can remain Saye
[09:15] because it's getting crazy out there
[09:18] it's it's it's a weird feeling uh you
[09:21] you see your your network going up for
[09:23] like 80 90 100% And and you I like I
[09:27] don't know you just described it I I
[09:28] don't feel a lot like it does not make
[09:30] anything but I think like the 100K could
[09:32] actually do a lot and and you described
[09:35] very beautifully right now with like
[09:36] this cycle how different this is because
[09:39] we we always talk about the super cycle
[09:41] and and and when you look at the larger
[09:43] picture I think we are in a super cycle
[09:45] since 15 years like Bitcoin is is its
[09:48] own large super cycle um but I really
[09:51] want to emphasize how different this
[09:54] cycle is we have now presidents and
[09:56] nation states talking about it like we
[09:58] we have putan El and maybe America
[10:01] stacking them each other out that is
[10:05] completely different and I think one
[10:07] thing that is uh really interesting
[10:09] right now it seems like there's no
[10:11] retail involved till now it seems like
[10:13] there's is is no real I don't get a lot
[10:15] of messages uh like the only retail
[10:19] messages I get people that are hold for
[10:21] a long time and now selling a little bit
[10:22] like it seems like really like retail is
[10:25] is sleeping and and not expecting
[10:27] something big and this this this is just
[10:29] driven by micro strategy buying a lot of
[10:32] Bitcoin Black Rock buying a lot of
[10:34] Bitcoin and all all that things could
[10:36] that actually um this this gradually and
[10:39] sadly moment now happen I had two or
[10:41] three episodes ago an amazing example
[10:45] with uh what what exponential growth is
[10:47] and I'm obsessed with that example right
[10:49] now um and this example is like okay you
[10:52] you fill a football stadium with water
[10:55] uh and the first minute you you drop one
[10:58] drop of water in there in the second
[10:59] minute you drop two drops of water in
[11:01] there and then like exponentially four
[11:03] eight and so on and the thing is after
[11:07] 45 minutes you're 7% high and after just
[11:11] 50 minutes or like five minutes more
[11:13] you're completely full and so I think
[11:15] that's what the the people always talk
[11:17] about gradually then sadly how do you
[11:19] look at that actually happening and this
[11:22] cycle might be actually different and
[11:24] this this whole nation state and
[11:27] institutional money coming in and then
[11:29] maybe at some at the same point with the
[11:31] 100K barrier retail is getting
[11:33] unlocked yeah well I absolutely love the
[11:36] exponential growth uh example that you
[11:38] just give because I I think about that
[11:40] constantly like personally I I like to
[11:42] joke that I'm a 65 IQ bitcoiner you know
[11:44] I used to be 80 I'm losing brain sales
[11:47] I'm 65 IQ bitcoiner so like I always
[11:50] think of it it's very hard to wrap our
[11:53] head around large numbers like even
[11:55] right now bitcoin's at like2 trillion
[11:56] dollars so it's like that we it we're so
[12:00] used to that number that we're like yeah
[12:01] whatever like two trillion like we're
[12:02] going to 280 trillion but if I I always
[12:05] remember there's there's a good
[12:07] infographic uh that goes around of like
[12:10] what a trillion dollars actually looks
[12:12] like and the amount of dollars to make
[12:15] two2 trillion or1 trillion do in $100
[12:18] bills I forget what it is but it like
[12:20] dwarfs like a whole airplane hanger like
[12:22] it's a lot of money like that it's like
[12:25] no wait I think it's like the it's like
[12:27] the Empire State build I forget what
[12:29] what the picture is but it's like it's a
[12:31] ridiculous amount of money and it takes
[12:33] up a lot of space and so I always try to
[12:37] wrap my head around big numbers because
[12:39] again 65 IQ maths is hard you know quick
[12:42] maths is even harder for me and so I try
[12:45] not to get to in the weeds with math but
[12:48] when you really understand exponential
[12:50] growth and how you know large numbers
[12:52] move it is incredible what big numbers
[12:56] can do and I'm not one of these people
[12:59] personally that thinks of the
[13:00] diminishing returns meme I know in the
[13:03] last kind of three Bitcoin Cycles we
[13:06] kind of have this like diminishing
[13:07] returns meme that like oh since the
[13:09] Bitcoin price is getting uh higher and
[13:12] the Market's getting bigger it takes
[13:14] more money to push the market and with
[13:17] that I'm like yeah you know depending on
[13:19] the previous data but now again it seems
[13:23] like a lot more Capital has been
[13:26] unlocked and a lot more capital is going
[13:28] to get into big Bitcoin so you know yes
[13:31] on the one hand the the law of big
[13:34] numbers is going to affect Bitcoin and
[13:36] and maybe we see diminishing returns but
[13:39] that is kind of just given the
[13:42] expectation that things are going to
[13:43] remain the same as they've had in the
[13:45] past and that's you know a few big
[13:47] convicted or yeah a few big Bitcoin
[13:50] companies with conviction getting into
[13:52] Bitcoin buying Bitcoin doing the micro
[13:54] uh micro strategy strategy and then
[13:56] retail like the last three Cycles
[14:00] from the beginning of Bitcoin up to 2021
[14:04] maybe maybe it was more like 2018 into
[14:07] 2020 I would argue that most of those
[14:10] Cycles were led by retail and you know
[14:13] that's why it's been such a good money
[14:16] that's been distributed around you know
[14:18] all the corners of the world is because
[14:20] individuals like ourselves have found
[14:23] bitcoin useful have have understood the
[14:26] underlying framework of Bitcoin and we
[14:29] all in you know like we we have no more
[14:31] Fiat left or like man I wish I had more
[14:33] money to buy more Bitcoin at these
[14:35] prices because we know it's never going
[14:37] to come down again or rather you know
[14:39] like M who knows where if there is a
[14:41] bare market and what's that's going to
[14:42] happen but when you understand what we
[14:44] just said a minute ago it's like nation
[14:46] states are fooing into Bitcoin like
[14:49] central banks are on the one hand
[14:51] attacking Bitcoin and on the other hand
[14:53] probably secretly like we need to get
[14:55] some Bitcoin and so if they turn on the
[14:57] money printers to buy Bitcoin literally
[14:59] they can print all of the money ever to
[15:01] buy Bitcoin and that isn't factored into
[15:04] the models as the Sailor quote goes you
[15:06] know all your models are broken and that
[15:09] even includes in Bitcoin models so as
[15:11] much as I'm trying to be conservative
[15:14] here it does feel like the s-curve
[15:17] adoption might be playing out not just
[15:19] like the you know exponent wait
[15:21] exponential log chart it's like the S
[15:24] curve where it takes a huge leap forward
[15:28] and I think that's where where it's at
[15:31] and not only thinking of just the amount
[15:32] of capital that's going to get into
[15:34] Bitcoin but personally I always say the
[15:37] same thing it's like look guys I know
[15:39] all bitcoiners only talk to other
[15:41] bitcoiners and we're in this Echo
[15:43] chamber and it seems like everyone
[15:45] around us understands or knows about
[15:47] Bitcoin but if you go out into normal
[15:49] life you know like you go out to dinner
[15:50] or go out to a bar with friends Normy
[15:52] friends and you start asking them about
[15:54] Bitcoin very few people either care or
[15:57] understand what Bitcoin is and with that
[15:59] comes the fact that the adoption levels
[16:02] of bitcoiners versus the total
[16:05] population I think is still incredibly
[16:07] low I think sailor numbers are something
[16:10] on the lines of like only 0.1% of the
[16:13] world's capital is in Bitcoin and his
[16:15] conservative estimate is that 7% of
[16:18] global Capital will get into Bitcoin and
[16:21] I kind of argue very similar that
[16:23] there's only I would say maybe you know
[16:26] like 1% of the population is like like
[16:29] adamant con uh adamant full bitcoiners
[16:33] Bitcoin Maxes with conviction that
[16:36] understand what they're holding and so
[16:38] that just means that we need uh I don't
[16:40] know like 99% more of the population to
[16:43] understand Bitcoin now I'm not saying
[16:45] that's going to happen in five 10 20
[16:48] years considering like I'm pretty sure
[16:51] the stat is only like 55% of the the
[16:55] global population right now is on the
[16:57] internet and it's not like the
[16:58] internet's ever going to go away but
[17:00] still if we get Global adoption of
[17:03] Bitcoin from 1% or 0.1% or whatever the
[17:06] number is to 50% that's still a lot of
[17:10] people that need to get into Bitcoin
[17:12] there's still a a the majority of the
[17:15] population that doesn't hold Bitcoin
[17:17] doesn't understand Bitcoin and so I
[17:19] think if you add those two things
[17:20] together like the amount of global
[17:22] Capital that's going to go into Bitcoin
[17:24] and the amount of adoption on an
[17:26] individual level that are going to
[17:27] combine into Bitcoin
[17:29] if that perfect storm hits Bitcoin you
[17:31] know this next year I think all our
[17:34] models are broken like we could be
[17:36] seeing that S curve adoption and that
[17:38] exponential growth that we talk about
[17:40] and I don't know if the the law of
[17:43] diminishing returns will hold up
[17:45] obviously I'm I don't know if this cycle
[17:47] is going to play out like the past
[17:49] Cycles if we're going super cycle Etc
[17:51] but like you said you know bitcoin's
[17:53] been in a bull market since 2009 for the
[17:56] last 15 years it's constantly in a bull
[17:58] market it's going up forever the price
[18:00] chart always goes up and to the right
[18:03] and even if you're conservative like the
[18:05] the 250 week moving average it's always
[18:08] going up like it's just constantly going
[18:10] up as more people adopt Bitcoin more
[18:12] people start to understand Bitcoin and
[18:14] more people start to throw Capital into
[18:16] Bitcoin so it does feel like it could
[18:19] get absolutely crazy and all of these
[18:21] memes that we've hold held on to in the
[18:23] past of you know exponential growth or
[18:25] laws of diminishing returns like it
[18:27] really does feel like s-curve adoption
[18:30] of Technology might be playing out and
[18:32] we know bitcoin's been adopted faster
[18:34] than the internet telephone and other
[18:37] Technologies in the world it's the best
[18:38] technology I I love the meme of um the
[18:41] internet was created solely to push
[18:44] Bitcoin adoption like Yeah The
[18:45] Internet's good but the only reason we
[18:48] ever even had the internet was so that
[18:50] people can adopt Bitcoin and when you
[18:52] kind of think about that you know
[18:53] exponential growth upon exponential
[18:55] growth it's like Bitcoin is high-powered
[18:58] super powered perfect money on internet
[19:01] rails and and we could get that into the
[19:03] hands of so many people as long as they
[19:06] kind of Leap Frog the traditional
[19:08] Financial system which we've seen play
[19:10] out with smartphones you know a lot of
[19:12] people around the world in third world
[19:14] developing countries like they don't
[19:15] have bank accounts but they have
[19:17] smartphones and it's very easy for us to
[19:20] you know just zap them some STS and now
[19:22] they're on the Bitcoin Network and if
[19:25] that starts to propagate out it really
[19:28] feels like the dominoes are falling
[19:29] really quick almost faster than I
[19:31] believed it would have even though like
[19:33] I know that it's happening as fast as I
[19:36] thought it was and in the moment you're
[19:37] like man it's happening so slow you know
[19:39] this last bare Market was kind of brutal
[19:40] like when it's the it's the the Bitcoin
[19:43] meme like poking it like uh Bitcoin can
[19:45] you do something but if you think about
[19:47] the groundwork we've laid the last two
[19:49] years the the fact that bitcoin's
[19:51] basically at 100K and no one's even
[19:53] noticing like all those things are very
[19:55] bullish to me and I'm I'm just very
[19:58] excited to see what happens in 2025 like
[20:01] how high can we run and will we ever see
[20:03] a cycle again like I think those are the
[20:05] big questions that we're seeing right
[20:07] now is you know the price moving this
[20:10] next year after it breaks 100K and is
[20:13] the Cycle Theory continuing to play out
[20:15] like when do we decouple from the Cycle
[20:17] Theory and it just keeps going up for
[20:19] it's like the the other Mee again guys
[20:21] sorry I speak in memes I'm I'm I'm
[20:23] basically a Zimmer here I speak in memes
[20:25] it's like that one uh that one Bitcoin
[20:27] meme where where the guy jumps into the
[20:29] water and then there's like a rocket
[20:31] ship under him and it's like the Bitcoin
[20:33] price
[20:35] like you know and it just keeps flying
[20:37] forever like I'm starting to feel that
[20:39] that exuberance and and that memetic
[20:41] Meme energy coming back into Bitcoin
[20:44] after I would argue a pretty brutal bar
[20:46] Market I think is the longest bar market
[20:48] and so a lot of us bitcoiners still have
[20:50] PTSD and we're like no you know I I've
[20:53] still been hearing the rumors or rather
[20:55] the grumblings from people like oh
[20:57] bitcoin's only going to go to 15 50k bro
[20:59] like bitcoin's only going to go to 200k
[21:00] and I'm like guys we're in a bull run
[21:03] we're in the blowoff top of a bull run
[21:05] and you think it's only going to go 50
[21:06] to 100 100% this next this next year
[21:10] like
[21:11] historically once Bitcoin breaks the
[21:14] all-time high and starts running in a
[21:15] bull run it it pumps for 11 months like
[21:18] we've only seen one month and people are
[21:20] like oh it's going to stop at 150k the
[21:22] for the whole year I'm like you're only
[21:24] going to see a 50 uh 50% this whole next
[21:27] year like that just doesn't sense to me
[21:29] honestly I would be pretty mad if that
[21:31] was the case I'm like dude what like
[21:33] what's the fun in this like the fun is
[21:35] dunking on people and being like see I
[21:36] was right we got a 5x this year like
[21:39] you're dumb uh but I'm I'm trying to
[21:41] stay humble I'm I'm really trying to
[21:43] stay humble but it is hard to not go to
[21:45] your friends and family and be like I
[21:47] told you so I've been telling you for
[21:48] seven years like it's very simple just
[21:50] save in Bitcoin live your life and and
[21:52] your life gets better and so I really
[21:54] want that euphoric moment next year of
[21:57] be like I told you you should have
[21:59] bought more Bitcoin listen to me I am
[22:01] the smart one in the family listen to
[22:05] me I love that and I mean for me it's
[22:09] like there's like those two hearts
[22:11] pounding in my chest because the one is
[22:14] like I I I really want that feeling that
[22:16] you just described and like hey see like
[22:18] I I told you like 7K per Bitcoin now we
[22:21] had like 250k or like 300K or whatever
[22:25] uh no no Robin sorry you're bearish I
[22:27] told you 7K now we're at
[22:30] 700k and I think that's the other heart
[22:33] that's beating in me because I'm like
[22:35] I'm just 26 and and I I I really want to
[22:39] earn a lot of Bitcoin and have fun uh
[22:42] when I'm like 35 40 50 not SP like I
[22:47] really would wish that the Bitcoin price
[22:49] is stuning again but I really don't
[22:51] think so like um as you said and
[22:53] especially like we have all the great
[22:55] things going now for Bitcoin and for me
[22:58] the big uh surprise fact in this cycle
[23:01] that I did not expect like a year or two
[23:04] years ago was Trump uh and America uh
[23:07] all of the sudden being in Bitcoin like
[23:09] I always accept I was always like
[23:11] America is like the the last one America
[23:15] has the US dollar they will always have
[23:17] some Bitcoin confiscated like maybe 200
[23:19] 300,000 which is a massive amount but
[23:22] they they will not consider that a
[23:23] strategic Reserve they will not consider
[23:25] accumulating Bitcoin as a strategic
[23:26] thing they will not pass a not a bill
[23:29] actually is in progress uh there so that
[23:32] was a huge unknown for me I did not
[23:34] expect it at all so with that being said
[23:38] I think all bats for the next years H
[23:41] and it's it's really interesting how how
[23:43] this goes and and I know with Nico
[23:46] actually a few months before especially
[23:48] on before the election I talked with him
[23:50] and we talked about Trump uh also a lot
[23:52] and especially like what impact it will
[23:55] have on bitcoin uh now we with you we
[23:58] have a little bit of data already but
[24:00] like still quite quite new because Trump
[24:02] is not even elected yet not he's elected
[24:05] but not in office yet um what do you
[24:08] think will be that the impact of trump
[24:11] all of the sudden
[24:13] being I'm I'm hesitating saying bullish
[24:16] on bitcoin because he's also doing a lot
[24:17] of crypto stuff uh but but he's
[24:20] definitely more bullish than than haris
[24:22] on on bitcoin yeah I mean I think we've
[24:25] seen kind of what the impact is already
[24:29] and I think the big if today you know
[24:32] this is November 22nd of 2024 we have
[24:35] about two months till Trump actually
[24:37] takes office and I think the big if is
[24:40] if there will be follow through on this
[24:42] but with that being said I think we've
[24:44] already kind of seen the impact of what
[24:46] Trump means to uh Bitcoin and and the
[24:50] World At Large because ever since Trump
[24:52] came out well really I guess it probably
[24:54] started with Larry Fink you know once
[24:55] Larry Fink kind of announced the Bitcoin
[24:57] ETF it kind of it was like a a shot
[25:00] across the bow and everyone was like oh
[25:03] well if Larry fin thinks Bitcoin is
[25:05] something that they want to make a
[25:06] product about not only does that one
[25:08] mean that his uh customers at Black Rock
[25:12] or you know the people that are uh
[25:15] having assets with black rock are
[25:17] talking about Bitcoin and they want that
[25:18] exposure but now that is the signal to
[25:22] other institutional managers that they
[25:24] have to also take Bitcoin seriously and
[25:26] so you know that started at the
[25:28] beginning of this year Larry Fink
[25:29] basically you know I know you're not an
[25:31] American and this might not be the the
[25:34] you know the this might be the quiet
[25:35] part out loud but whatever Larry Fink
[25:37] wants he usually gets and you know
[25:40] there's there's rumors and and there's
[25:42] trolling that Larry Fink's the real
[25:43] president of the United States you know
[25:45] the the the capital that is Flowing is
[25:49] really the one that's in control as as
[25:51] the meme goes those who Lobby the the
[25:53] government are the ones that actually
[25:54] own the politician and Larry fing
[25:57] basically owns everything you know you
[25:58] could argue Larry Fink owns basically
[26:00] half of the world at this point and so
[26:01] what Larry gets you know or what Larry
[26:03] wants Larry gets and so once he kind of
[26:06] put his stamp of approval on bitcoin
[26:08] with the ETF product then it became from
[26:12] you know the past where it was like oh
[26:14] it's career suicide to embrace Bitcoin
[26:16] to the opposite where you have a
[26:18] fiduciary responsibility to embrace
[26:20] Bitcoin at this point like if Larry
[26:21] Fink's doing it and you know you're like
[26:24] some mom and pop or a smaller
[26:25] institutional manager like oh you think
[26:27] you know better than Larry f bro like he
[26:29] wants Bitcoin he has a Bitcoin product
[26:31] you have to embrace Bitcoin and then
[26:33] fast forward about what six months and I
[26:35] think the first Trump announcement was
[26:37] around July we know Trump went to
[26:41] bitcoin 2024 in Nashville and did his
[26:44] speech and the whole historic Bitcoin
[26:45] strategic reserve and then ever since
[26:48] then we've seen other nations have to
[26:51] take Bitcoin seriously like I said
[26:53] earlier you know China seems to be kind
[26:55] of reversing roles in Bitcoin and so the
[26:59] game theory is playing out you know
[27:00] Russia's also kind of being a little
[27:02] more a little more lenient embracing
[27:04] Bitcoin and so and then just recently we
[27:07] saw you know smaller countries like
[27:08] Poland and presidential candidates there
[27:11] talking about Bitcoin and so you can see
[27:13] the game theory play out or as Kaiser
[27:15] always calls it the global hash War
[27:16] start to play out and it's like if you
[27:19] want to well no one will ever have first
[27:21] mover Advantage because El Salvador took
[27:23] that from you know they will always be
[27:26] cemented as the first country to race
[27:28] Bitcoin you know their their name El
[27:30] Salvador translated to savior like do we
[27:32] leave do we live in a simulation is
[27:35] there a simulation out there because
[27:37] it's kind of too perfect so El Salvador
[27:39] will always be the first country right
[27:41] but when you really look at the math El
[27:44] salador is a tiny country Bitcoin put
[27:45] them on the map their GDP is I I haven't
[27:48] looked at it this year or updated
[27:50] recently but it's roughly around 32
[27:53] billion dollar like Elon Musk could buy
[27:56] I I forget what the numberers but like
[27:57] 20 El Salvador is like they're a tiny
[28:00] country uh they're obviously trying to
[28:03] be more future facing they're trying to
[28:07] uh make sure that they are able to
[28:09] compete in the future and obviously
[28:11] adopting the futures money which is
[28:13] Bitcoin is how they're able to do that
[28:15] and put themselves on the global stage
[28:17] but I think what really is the defining
[28:20] conversation now is what is happening in
[28:22] America and American politics and of
[28:25] course there's other issues in regards
[28:26] to politics that like we don't have to
[28:28] get into because we're bitcoiners but
[28:30] the fact that Trump did come out and say
[28:32] like hey I want Bitcoin to be a crypto
[28:35] capital of the world like we can't let
[28:36] China get ahead of us we can't let
[28:38] Russia get ahead of us like that game
[28:40] theory is playing out and everyone else
[28:42] has to take it seriously and what we've
[28:44] seen in the last couple of months or
[28:46] rather the last couple of weeks more so
[28:48] is that it's not just coming from the
[28:50] federal level in the US it's coming from
[28:52] the states as well and now we're seeing
[28:54] that states in the United States are
[28:57] also looking for strategic Reserve bills
[28:59] they're also talking about adopting
[29:01] Bitcoin for their personal State
[29:03] Treasury and so you know this is this is
[29:06] fracturing into where if you want to
[29:09] maintain the lead the competitive lead
[29:11] that you have right now you have to
[29:14] embrace Bitcoin and I was like you you
[29:16] know for a while on our show on simply
[29:18] Bitcoin Nico and I pretty much ever
[29:22] since uh I don't know like two months
[29:24] ago really maybe three months ago we
[29:27] were we were very seriously concerned
[29:30] about what was happening in the US with
[29:32] all of the operation choke point 2.0
[29:34] news that kept coming out and the fact
[29:36] that more data was coming out that the
[29:38] current Administration was actually
[29:40] fighting the Bitcoin industry and trying
[29:42] to stop Bitcoin adoption there was a
[29:44] very real conversation of like wow uh
[29:47] are we going to actually have to leave
[29:49] our home because we're bitcoiners like
[29:51] it got a little it got a little scary
[29:53] there for a little bit and now you know
[29:56] I I don't want to get too hopeful uh but
[29:58] I am optimistic about where this is
[30:00] going and if we get four years of
[30:02] favorable coverage from the Trump
[30:04] Administration then that's obviously
[30:07] going to allow Capital to flow into
[30:09] Bitcoin Bitcoin companies won't have to
[30:11] leave the US you know like hey
[30:13] bitcoiners can say all they want about
[30:14] wallet of Satoshi but it was one of the
[30:17] best wallets like it works yes it's
[30:18] custodial but like it simply works and I
[30:21] think that is kind of where we need to
[30:23] go with Bitcoin products is it needs to
[30:26] be consumer friendly and if the biggest
[30:28] countries in the world or the biggest
[30:30] companies in the world are leaving you
[30:32] know what I would argue again I'm an
[30:33] American I'm American Centric uh would
[30:36] are leaving the best country in the
[30:37] world because of unfavorable regulations
[30:41] and laws like that is a detriment for
[30:44] everyone on planet Earth like we want
[30:47] the world the country with the most
[30:48] Capital to have the most bitcoiners so
[30:51] that they can build the good products so
[30:52] that Bitcoin becomes the truly
[30:54] Unstoppable Freedom money and the fact
[30:56] that we've been fighting Bitcoin or
[30:58] rather the US government's been fighting
[30:59] Bitcoin like that definitely hurt
[31:02] adoption you know Gary genser just
[31:03] resigned yesterday saying he's going to
[31:05] leave once uh Trump gets into office
[31:08] he's he's famously uh taught an MIT
[31:11] course on bitcoin he becomes the SEC
[31:15] head and he's just like doing his best
[31:18] to slow walk the Bitcoin ETFs and and so
[31:21] now we're like okay get someone in there
[31:23] that that is going to be favorable for
[31:24] Bitcoin so all that being said it does
[31:28] feel like there is a whole new game
[31:32] theory being played out it's no longer
[31:34] just the individual level it's the
[31:35] nation state level and I like you said I
[31:39] I was with you cu the US is in a
[31:41] precarious situation right now where
[31:43] like Trump is going out there and saying
[31:45] like I'm going to embrace Bitcoin we're
[31:47] going to have a strategic Bitcoin
[31:48] Reserve we're going to get us out of
[31:50] debt by holding Bitcoin and with that
[31:53] comes the fact that the US still has the
[31:54] world Reserve currency and so it is kind
[31:58] of an admission by a non-admission that
[32:01] the US dollar rather Fiat currencies in
[32:03] general are trash and if they fully
[32:05] Embrace Bitcoin is that one of those
[32:07] tipping points where other people start
[32:09] to realize like oh wait uh why am I
[32:12] holding these Fiat currencies when even
[32:14] the US government is saving in Bitcoin
[32:16] and if they start to print money to buy
[32:18] Bitcoin then that gets it then that gets
[32:21] us into this like you know
[32:24] hyperinflation debt spiral where the
[32:27] average person is getting decimated
[32:29] because they're holding Fiat currencies
[32:31] and the US government is printing more
[32:33] and more and more of the dollars to buy
[32:35] Bitcoin so as Bitcoin holders obviously
[32:38] we're going to be happy like yeah you
[32:39] know pump our bags forever US Government
[32:41] like turn the money printer on to buy
[32:43] Bitcoin I am okay with this I am
[32:45] protected I'm on the Lifeboat but if
[32:47] they do do that that is an admission of
[32:50] just how bad the Fiat system is how bad
[32:53] Fiat currencies are and so they are in a
[32:55] very precarious situation of course
[32:57] world Reserve Curr currency status um
[33:00] are they going to maintain that status
[33:02] by you know basically backing the US
[33:05] dollar with Bitcoin however that
[33:06] mechanism is going to work but it is an
[33:09] admission of the fact that the dollar is
[33:11] trash if they are like yeah we don't
[33:13] want dollars like we don't want treasure
[33:14] we don't want we don't even want our own
[33:16] debt like you know they don't even want
[33:17] their own treasury bonds anymore they're
[33:19] like actually you know Gold's old let's
[33:22] embrace the future let's start saving in
[33:24] Bitcoin let's turn the money printer on
[33:26] to buy Bitcoin so really has changed the
[33:28] game and again the big if here is what
[33:31] follow-through are we going to see in
[33:33] 2025 was this just all political
[33:36] pandering to bitcoiners you know
[33:38] bitcoiners as a political pack I'm
[33:40] pretty sure raised like $130 million so
[33:43] like that was a significant lobbying
[33:46] effort by the Bitcoin industry and so
[33:49] with that comes the fact that hey we
[33:51] paid you so now you got to listen to us
[33:54] we're in the room now and we're not
[33:56] going to just give you $130 million and
[33:59] you don't really follow through so
[34:01] that's kind of where we are right now
[34:03] where at first it got scary Trump comes
[34:06] out like we're going to embrace Bitcoin
[34:08] now he gets elected so now the
[34:10] conversation is like holy [ __ ] the US
[34:12] government is going to embrace Bitcoin
[34:13] like we have to follow or else they're
[34:16] going to leave us behind you know
[34:17] America is already technically the
[34:19] biggest holder of Bitcoin in the world
[34:22] as on a nation state level and if they
[34:24] do flip that over to bitcoin and not
[34:26] keep selling it to the market and then
[34:28] also add more Bitcoin to that treasury
[34:31] they might be pulling like a Michael
[34:32] sailor strategy where like I I think
[34:35] Michael sailor is very comfortably in
[34:37] the lead for the person that will ever
[34:39] have the most Bitcoin publicly like yeah
[34:41] Satoshi has roughly you know a million
[34:43] Bitcoin but we don't know if he's ever
[34:45] even going to come back we don't even
[34:46] know if he's alive we don't know if he
[34:47] has the keys to that Bitcoin so on a on
[34:50] a you know individual level and on a
[34:53] company level it seems like no one's
[34:55] going to be able to catch up to sailor
[34:57] and and if the US government kind of
[34:59] does something similar and the price
[35:01] starts to run to these incredible levels
[35:03] it seems like maybe no other country
[35:05] will be able to catch up to American
[35:07] Bitcoin Holdings and you know as an
[35:09] American I'm a little conflicted like
[35:12] yeah I want you know American Excellence
[35:14] to maintain because I I don't want my
[35:17] home and my family to start to dwindle
[35:20] um on their living standards but then
[35:22] also it's like how did they acquire that
[35:25] Bitcoin uh you know no one wants to talk
[35:27] about the fact that how they acquired
[35:29] that Bitcoin and now they're kind of
[35:30] like yeah let's just B move it over on
[35:32] our accounting sheet and hey we get to
[35:34] profit off of this Bitcoin so you know I
[35:37] am a little conflicted here but the game
[35:39] theory is playing out and everyone has
[35:41] to take Bitcoin seriously like bitcoin's
[35:42] a mature thing and they can no longer
[35:45] just be like oh uh you guys are you know
[35:47] drug dealers and and uh you know
[35:50] Financial wait is this going on YouTube
[35:53] maybe I should maybe I should chill you
[35:54] know you guys are illiterate Financial
[35:56] idiots over here
[35:58] um now it's like oh uh the suits are
[36:01] here they're going to try to mature you
[36:03] know quote unquote mature this acid
[36:05] class and you know basically like Point
[36:07] their fingers at us and like oh you
[36:08] stupid kids and hoodies don't know
[36:10] what's going on and we're like hey bro
[36:12] like you just showed up to the game
[36:14] we've been doing this for over a decade
[36:16] like chill out I get it you guys got the
[36:18] capital but the game is changing and I
[36:21] think very interestings are going to
[36:23] start to develop in the next you know
[36:25] year four like by next election cycle
[36:29] who knows where the Bitcoin price could
[36:31] be but we did see something interesting
[36:33] this cycle where if politicians fight
[36:36] Bitcoin they might not end up in office
[36:38] it's not as easy as Elizabeth Warren
[36:40] going out there with her anti- crypto
[36:42] Army you know Meme it's like if you
[36:45] fight this industry you not only are you
[36:47] hurting the people that you're supposed
[36:49] to represent but you're going to hurt
[36:50] your chances of being a politician still
[36:51] and so like we've matured and we are a
[36:54] movement yes we still need to kind of
[36:56] build our our our financial stockpile as
[36:59] an industry yes we still have to secure
[37:01] our ranks as more people come into
[37:03] Bitcoin but you can see where this is
[37:05] headed that Bitcoin is a real political
[37:08] movement even though a lot of bitcoiners
[37:10] like to say like oh Bitcoin isn't
[37:12] political it's like yeah it's a
[37:13] political money which means it is
[37:15] actually political and now hey we're
[37:18] lobbying the we're lobbying the
[37:19] government so as Max Kaiser said he who
[37:22] owns the Bitcoins makes the rules so you
[37:25] know maybe we're going to be buying
[37:26] politicians soon Robin been like you
[37:28] know maybe you have your own and I have
[37:29] my own and hey this sounds great I I'm

[39:48] like I have a lot more work to do in
[39:50] Europe yeah yeah you
[39:53] do because you you told like the America
[39:56] uh the Bitcoin with the 200,000 that
[39:59] they have or something like along those
[40:01] lines and you conflicted of like how
[40:03] they got it but at least they were
[40:05] clever enough to not sell it because you
[40:07] know
[40:09] Germany dude they're so wrecked right
[40:12] now they they literally I think they
[40:14] they triggered the bull market because
[40:16] since then the Bitcoin just went up in a
[40:18] straight line and was I don't know two
[40:20] two or two and a half months ago how
[40:22] when they sold uh it was it was crazy
[40:25] that they they did that and now there's
[40:27] like a there's website outside there
[40:29] that tracks how much money they lost on
[40:32] the missed gains they could have made if
[40:34] they just like waited half a year or
[40:36] something like that it's crazy it's like
[40:38] almost now at 1.5 billion I don't know
[40:40] what the the mavx uh looks like but yeah
[40:43] they had 50,000 Bitcoin they sold at
[40:45] like around 60k or something like that
[40:48] uh now it's it's soon at 100K you can do
[40:51] the ma how much money they lost with
[40:53] just like selling too early or selling
[40:55] at all like they they could have said
[40:57] like they don't need those those money
[40:59] and and the weird thing is I don't know
[41:01] if that made the Press uh overseas also
[41:04] but they really celebrated that sell
[41:06] like they really celebrated oh like we
[41:08] made that money now because we
[41:10] confiscated the bad guys and now we
[41:11] liquidated the Bitcoin and now we got
[41:14] all that that feed money and so they
[41:16] really celebrated the fact that they
[41:18] sold the Bitcoin and liquidated it in
[41:21] euros and I was like yeah like let's
[41:23] look back in half a year year uh and
[41:26] this look back is here after like two
[41:28] three months that's pretty crazy for me
[41:32] yeah I know that's crazy absolutely it's
[41:34] already like
[41:35] 100x it's crazy yeah um you brought up
[41:39] so many interesting points first of all
[41:40] I think uh I forgot what you exactly
[41:44] said but the thought came into my mind
[41:46] of like uh Bitcoin is for me the
[41:48] scoreboard of how bad the field system
[41:51] actually is doing uh and so we we kind
[41:54] of see like uh we how great Bitcoin is
[41:57] but at the same time how bad actually
[41:59] fear it is because one part of the
[42:00] Bitcoin price is the adoption of more
[42:02] people getting it but another part is
[42:04] just like the money that it is measured
[42:07] in so the US dollars is just getting
[42:08] debased also at a rapid pace so that's
[42:11] great and also msdr that I wanted to
[42:14] talk about a little bit um saor said I
[42:17] think today or like yesterday or
[42:19] somewhere along those lines something
[42:21] with like they are printing 500 million
[42:23] US dollars per day if if you look at the
[42:25] numbers of of the the evaluation going
[42:28] up with that they are almost like the
[42:30] most profitable company on earth now do
[42:32] do you think they they actually have a
[42:34] shot at being the biggest one on earth
[42:37] when they keep executing that and
[42:39] there's also the the big question are
[42:41] the overpriced how do you look at micro
[42:44] strategy yeah well first off I I am uh I
[42:49] am almost feeling the fomo to buy some
[42:51] micro strategy stock but I feel like
[42:53] I've missed the boat you know I've been
[42:55] watching it all year it's like my job at
[42:58] simply Bitcoin is obviously stay current
[43:00] on the news and we cover the news daily
[43:02] and I I forget what the number was but
[43:04] like the beginning of the year it was
[43:05] like $100 and now it's like 500 like it
[43:08] had a 5x this year and I've been
[43:09] watching it the whole year and I I
[43:11] really feel like the people that look at
[43:13] uh Bitcoin and they see the price run
[43:15] and like I'm too late to buy it like I
[43:17] don't want to buy the top and I don't
[43:19] own any stocks at all but watching what
[43:22] Michael sailor has been doing he's been
[43:25] putting on a master class and I know
[43:27] he's kind of been fighting the meme of
[43:29] like the infinite money glitch recently
[43:30] he's like it's not infinite money glitch
[43:32] but it does feel like that's what he's
[43:35] doing you know he's able to take yeah
[43:37] what yeah what's the what what is the it
[43:40] it was 68 uh now like it it 4 that
[43:44] that's just like 550% that that's insane
[43:48] yeah it it's nuts so you know on the one
[43:51] hand watching the stock go absolutely
[43:55] nuclear um and and he actually did a
[43:57] really good interview this morning um I
[44:00] think it was CNBC or something like that
[44:03] or maybe a squawkbox I I forget what it
[44:05] was but he really he did like a
[44:08] 10-minute rip and explains you know the
[44:10] whole process of micro strategy and one
[44:12] of the things he basically said is like
[44:14] yeah right like micro strategy is
[44:16] basically a levered Bitcoin play you
[44:17] know like for every Bitcoin that goes in
[44:20] I basically am able to gain like three
[44:24] 3x Bitcoin on top of that and you're
[44:26] like dude how do you like how is this
[44:29] even possible you know like what is
[44:30] going on here but I've been joking all
[44:32] year like man you know if you look at
[44:34] the numbers for these loans he's getting
[44:37] like I forget what the number is but
[44:38] it's like less than 1% interest rates
[44:42] for the next 10 years to go buy Bitcoin
[44:44] and it's like if if any normal person
[44:48] had even if it was like 4% you know like
[44:51] I I forget what the number was but it's
[44:52] somewhere between either like 1 to
[44:55] 4% interest on on these loans for 10
[44:58] years it's like bitcoin's going to blow
[45:01] past that like that's such an like
[45:03] that's such an easy trade for any
[45:05] bitcoiner that understand what is going
[45:07] on here and that really goes back to
[45:09] this whole idea of like will the money
[45:11] printer get turned on to buy Bitcoin or
[45:14] rather you know what we're starting to
[45:15] see in the last couple of weeks since
[45:17] Trump got elected is you're starting to
[45:19] see the banks and the traditional
[45:21] institutional asset managers start to
[45:24] kind of understand the micro strategy
[45:26] stry and be like well if I can take very
[45:29] cheap loans out and I just buy Bitcoin
[45:33] and I hold it for you know 4 to 8 years
[45:35] before this this 10year loan actually
[45:38] matures then like I am in the green like
[45:41] that's an easy no-brainer trade for
[45:43] anyone that isn't afraid of Bitcoin
[45:45] volatility and so you're seeing what
[45:47] Michael sailor is doing with micro
[45:49] strategy and of course on the one hand
[45:50] I'm like man I I should have bought that
[45:53] stock at 60 bucks I would have had a 5x
[45:55] this year now I'm like oh man I don't
[45:57] know if I can do it like it's it's
[45:59] already a $500 so you're seeing the
[46:01] psychology play out with micro strategy
[46:04] stock like people are seeing with the
[46:06] Bitcoin stock and I think sailor is just
[46:10] you know putting on a master class out
[46:12] here for every other Corporation to
[46:14] follow suit we see this week as well
[46:17] that he is going to do a three-minute
[46:20] presentation for the Microsoft board to
[46:23] actually have them adopt Bitcoin as a
[46:25] strategic Reserve or rather put put it
[46:27] on their treasury balance sheet and so
[46:29] you're you have to I I'm convinced that
[46:32] every huge CEO or every Executive Suite
[46:36] in the world that runs the biggest
[46:37] companies and corporations in the world
[46:40] have to legitimately look at Michael
[46:41] sailor and be like can we do this is
[46:44] this feasible for us like is this the
[46:46] way that we maintain our head start and
[46:49] now our dominance in the market is by
[46:51] just simply adopting Bitcoin and it
[46:54] seems like that's the case like it seems
[46:56] all you need to do it's like obviously
[46:57] you want to have a good product you need
[46:59] to have a good business but adding
[47:01] Bitcoin to your balance sheet is a cheat
[47:04] code I mean you and I've have
[47:05] experienced that on a personal level and
[47:08] you know the meme that we've always
[47:09] heard at least in Bitcoin spaces is like
[47:11] if you balance your your uh checking
[47:14] book like the government did you'd all
[47:15] be bankrupt and if you kind of flip that
[47:18] on this on on you know flip that script
[47:19] on his head well it's like well maybe
[47:21] corporations and nation states should
[47:23] balance their checkbook like bitcoiners
[47:25] you know you live below your means you
[47:27] you have a skill you have a job and then
[47:30] you put your excess profits in Bitcoin
[47:32] and then soon enough like you know your
[47:34] your Bitcoin stack is moving more than
[47:36] your yearly salary and you're like what
[47:38] the hell is going on right now and so I
[47:41] think what we are seeing and sailor is
[47:45] starting to kind of really prove it and
[47:48] I think 2024 was the year that sailor
[47:50] got Vindicated like at large over
[47:52] everyone that's noticing is that there
[47:55] is a new paradigm plan playing out
[47:57] there's like the old Paradigm the
[47:58] dinosaur Paradigm of traditional Fiat
[48:01] institutional managers you know you you
[48:04] buy treasury bond and you get 6%
[48:06] interest a year and you know you just
[48:08] kind of flip it over and like it's just
[48:10] funny to me that Wall Street it gets so
[48:12] excited for like you know 2% 6% profits
[48:16] and us bitcoiners are like dude we
[48:18] that's like a morning fluctuation in
[48:20] Bitcoin 6% and we don't even wake up
[48:22] until we start seeing 20% plus moves in
[48:25] Bitcoin and so think actually even
[48:28] talking about sailor he did a great
[48:30] interview with um with Nat Brunell this
[48:33] week as well and he said something on
[48:35] the lines of uh the traditional
[48:38] Financial World essentially only works
[48:42] with like six% gains and if you get
[48:45] Bitcoin in it and you get these 60%
[48:48] gains it's like it's like you know
[48:50] connecting uh like live electricity into
[48:53] the Fiat system and it makes it just go
[48:56] B and blow up and so you're starting to
[48:59] see the old thinking from traditional
[49:00] Financial world look at Bitcoin and
[49:04] they're trying to wrap their head around
[49:06] okay how do we incorporate this without
[49:08] blowing up all of our models without
[49:10] actually blowing up the financial world
[49:11] because hey if the world is basically
[49:15] you know running on two to six% interest
[49:18] rates and that's kind of how we have
[49:19] this Perpetual growth if you throw 60%
[49:23] gains into that like we really are going
[49:26] to see you know like some
[49:28] deflationary aspects of the economy and
[49:31] we all know what keynesians think about
[49:33] deflation they're like that's the big
[49:34] Boogeyman in the room whereas if you
[49:36] listen to Jeff Booth it's like that's
[49:39] how things are supposed to work like
[49:40] things are supposed to get cheaper over
[49:42] time but in the status quo that we're
[49:45] seeing in the dinosaur Paradigm that is
[49:47] the current traditional Financial system
[49:49] it's very hard for them to understand
[49:52] this new paradigm of Bitcoin it's kind
[49:54] of like you know the meme of uh putting
[49:56] a square peg into a round hole they're
[49:58] like you know they're they're trying to
[50:00] morph Bitcoin into the traditional
[50:03] Financial world and this is why you're
[50:05] seeing a lot of the rhetoric that you're
[50:06] seeing you know like oh bitcoin's an
[50:08] asset bitcoin's just a commodity like
[50:10] it's not money um and and there there's
[50:13] some legal ramifications for why that is
[50:15] a case but you're also seeing that
[50:17] they're just you know they're trying to
[50:18] wrap their head around what they know
[50:21] and what they've been invested in and
[50:23] you know what they've been studying and
[50:24] talking for the last like 40 years and
[50:26] being like oh we know you know we're in
[50:28] our suits like we know we know what this
[50:30] Bitcoin thing is and we're like I don't
[50:32] think you do I think Satoshi opened up a
[50:34] whole like a what's a sailor said it one
[50:36] time like Satoshi opened up a portal
[50:38] into cyberspace and now you know it's
[50:41] bringing the future into the past like I
[50:43] I can't do the Sailor isms but you get
[50:45] the idea it's like Bitcoin has
[50:49] fundamentally like put a tear into the
[50:53] Continuum you know the SpaceTime
[50:54] Continuum of the Fiat system and now
[50:57] they have to figure it out like they
[50:59] have to find a way to embrace Bitcoin to
[51:02] adopt Bitcoin and also maintain their
[51:06] kind of status quo and their leads and
[51:08] uh you know all of us bitcoiners are
[51:10] just kind of sitting here chilling or
[51:11] like yo just uh you know pump my bags
[51:14] but also don't Co-op this Bitcoin
[51:15] Network because it's so beautiful and as
[51:18] the number goes up more bitcoiners get
[51:21] financially free as more bitcoiners get
[51:23] financially free this movement starts to
[51:25] build with more people adopting it and
[51:27] more Capital behind it and it's going to
[51:30] dwarf the system you know there's a
[51:31] tsunami on the horizon and it's coming
[51:33] for the big bad Boogeyman of the world
[51:36] which is all of the traditional
[51:38] Financial worlds and it's like man it it
[51:40] feels like it's actually happening
[51:42] dude it's definitely happening and it's
[51:44] it's crazy to look at I'm really looking
[51:47] forward to the freem minute presentation
[51:48] of saor at Microsoft I'm really looking
[51:51] forward because he I never heard him
[51:53] giving an answer under three minutes
[51:57] we'll be will'll be fun to see uh on the
[52:00] three minutes and the whole whole thing
[52:02] maybe we can then take this three minute
[52:04] just just learn it by hard and then take
[52:06] it to Christmas to all to all our our
[52:09] people there um one thing that uh I keep
[52:12] hearing uh when we talk about micro
[52:15] strategy is that micro strategy is the
[52:17] new altcoin season like usually in the
[52:20] The Bull Run you're like oh like you you
[52:22] buying some altcoin to get more Bitcoin
[52:26] uh and never was a fan of that because I
[52:28] just like my Bitcoin in self custody and
[52:30] don't touch anything else H is is kind
[52:32] of micro strategy not a new altcoin
[52:35] season and maybe even like a maybe even
[52:38] like negative a little bit of a
[52:40] distraction for for Bitcoin hodlers
[52:42] because they like ah okay let's let's
[52:43] sell 10% or 20% of my Bitcoin Holdings
[52:46] and just like get into micro strategy to
[52:48] get uh a little bit of a leverage in
[52:50] there uh could it could it be also like
[52:53] distraction for for bitcoiners well I
[52:56] think so I mean I haven't really I I
[52:58] haven't come across that Meme of like
[53:00] micro strategies the new altcoin play
[53:02] basically to get more Bitcoin I haven't
[53:05] heard it put in that way but I have seen
[53:06] a lot of people on Twitter basically be
[53:08] like oh I sold all my Bitcoin to buy
[53:10] master stock and you know I'm up four to
[53:13] 5x I'm going to run with it and then you
[53:15] know eventually put it back into Bitcoin
[53:17] personally that's I would never do that
[53:20] but hey you know like get your gains and
[53:22] that's awesome for you and it it does
[53:25] seem like that might be the play you
[53:27] know it is basically a lever Bitcoin
[53:29] play uh though it's very interesting I
[53:31] don't know if you saw it this morning
[53:33] and and I'm not sure if you're familiar
[53:34] with Jim Kramer but he basic course yeah
[53:38] okay so did you see the clip I think it
[53:40] happened last night um or maybe it was
[53:43] this morning I forget but someone
[53:44] basically called and was like uh let me
[53:47] tell you about this stock it's going 5x
[53:50] it's it's been killing it all year and
[53:53] it's micro strategy like what do you
[53:55] think about it and and he basically was
[53:57] like you know like I would just buy
[54:00] Bitcoin like I would do what micro
[54:02] strategy is doing and just buy Bitcoin
[54:04] like you don't need the leverage play
[54:06] and he's literally like I like Bitcoin
[54:07] it's the winning move and we're like no
[54:09] we're never going to see 100K wreck like
[54:11] inverse Kramer activated now but even
[54:13] sailor kind of said the same thing where
[54:15] he's like look if your play is by micro
[54:20] strategy you know to to just like
[54:23] increase your Bitcoin stack he's like I
[54:25] wouldn't do that like I'm just buying
[54:26] Bitcoin like the move is buying Bitcoin
[54:29] and that's what you should be doing is
[54:31] like I'm showing the world how to do it
[54:34] but you should just be buying Bitcoin
[54:35] because that's what we're doing now
[54:38] obviously we all understand like if you
[54:39] have capital in the traditional
[54:41] Financial world it is a lot more
[54:43] difficult to get it completely into spot
[54:45] Bitcoin like those Vehicles aren't fully
[54:47] fleshed out yet yes you can buy some
[54:48] Bitcoin ETFs but if you have capital in
[54:52] institutional markets like you probably
[54:54] buy micro strategy like the ETFs aren't
[54:57] going 5x this year so it is very
[54:59] interesting idea of is micro strategy
[55:02] the new altcoin play and is it a
[55:07] distraction maybe but I think it's also
[55:10] kind of giving Bitcoin a a lot more
[55:14] publicity because everyone anyone that
[55:17] looks into micro strategy they you know
[55:19] we were kind of joking this week it's
[55:20] like what does Micro strategy actually
[55:22] do you know like they're they're a
[55:23] Bitcoin development company they're
[55:25] they're an intelligent a you know
[55:27] business intelligence company but in
[55:29] real in you know in reality what
[55:31] everyone's kind of saying is like
[55:32] they're just a company that Stacks
[55:34] Bitcoin and figure out a way to take out
[55:35] debt and buy more Bitcoin obviously
[55:37] sailor would probably say otherwise and
[55:39] and he's a lot more eloquent when he
[55:41] says it but for the average person out
[55:43] there it's like what did they actually
[55:44] do they just buy Bitcoin so maybe I
[55:46] should just buy Bitcoin so I think that
[55:48] does give a lot of publicity for kind of
[55:51] the average person out there obviously
[55:53] most people are just going to kind of be
[55:54] like uh I just the gains I'm just going
[55:57] to you know I'm just buying stock for
[55:58] the the the gains that they're
[56:00] increasing and maybe eventually they'll
[56:03] kind of fall down the rabbit hole of
[56:04] like oh well you know all they're doing
[56:06] is buying Bitcoin maybe I should just
[56:07] buy some Bitcoin directly for myself and
[56:10] understand the whole Freedom aspects of
[56:12] it but on a more cynical uh view I have
[56:15] seen a few bitcoiners kind of go a
[56:17] little more cynical with with micro
[56:19] strategy and saying that like he's going
[56:22] to blow up eventually and I don't I
[56:23] don't know about all of that but it
[56:26] would kind of relate to the altcoin
[56:28] cycle thing Theory you're talking about
[56:31] where you know you get your gains and
[56:32] then eventually the altcoin cycle ends
[56:35] like obviously personally as a bitcoiner
[56:39] that runs a Bitcoin company I I never
[56:41] wish uh Mal intention on any Bitcoin
[56:44] company period like I think all Bitcoin
[56:47] companies do a service to the industry
[56:49] to you know either propagandize Bitcoin
[56:53] get good products out for bitcoiners or
[56:55] you know know get into the Normie mind
[56:57] share of Bitcoin or sorry in the Normie
[57:00] mind share about Bitcoin and so I I
[57:02] wouldn't want to see that um but
[57:04] obviously there there is I think some
[57:07] people kind of being cynical and saying
[57:09] that and hey it might it might play out
[57:11] to the allcoin season but it seems like
[57:13] sailor's been very good at hedging his
[57:15] bets and man again you know going back
[57:17] to the last rant like I wish I bought
[57:20] some micro strategy at this point you
[57:22] know I would have liked a cool 5x this
[57:24] year while we got only what like a
[57:26] I don't know like a onx you know like 5x
[57:29] is way better than
[57:30] onx H we we we got with I have it here
[57:33] because I keep monitoring just so I can
[57:36] see if we actually hit the 100K while I
[57:38] stream uh we had
[57:40] 124% this year y t not not too bad but
[57:44] it's a little bit more than 2x uh pretty
[57:48] lame against the 5x for M
[57:50] strategy yeah that's what I'm saying man
[57:53] like uh I want a 5x I want five bagger
[57:56] this is 2025 true maybe it comes later
[57:59] for for for Bitcoin and it's also
[58:01] interesting uh what you mentioned uh if
[58:03] if you have if you have to put in the
[58:05] stock uh and maybe I would also go with
[58:08] micro strategy over like Bitcoin ETF
[58:09] like if you have a retirement account or
[58:11] something like that and you don't have
[58:13] the choice of self cust Bitcoin then
[58:15] actually I think micro strategy is is a
[58:17] really good choice because it's faster
[58:19] and to be honest I think it has kind of
[58:21] the same risk than a Bitcoin ETF uh it
[58:24] all all of the it obviously doesn't has
[58:27] the leverage but I I kind of think uh
[58:31] Michael saor knows to a certain extent
[58:33] what he does financially so I don't
[58:35] think it will blow up because of depth
[58:37] so it has the same risk for me as a
[58:39] Bitcoin ADF but yeah not a financial
[58:41] advice I have no clue I was in stocks
[58:43] before but I just got lucky I didn't
[58:46] knew what I was doing there definitely
[58:49] uh but yeah really cool uh one thing
[58:51] that you mentioned before that you're
[58:53] talking in memes and maybe a little bit
[58:54] of change of pace here um how important
[58:58] is that whole Bitcoin culture for you
[59:01] that that Meme culture we often say like
[59:03] we we meming Bitcoin on the global
[59:05] balance sheet of of the world it seems
[59:07] like and also see uh as content creators
[59:11] a little bit as the the digital soldiers
[59:13] that go out and evangelize Bitcoin and
[59:15] just be present everywhere I really like
[59:18] the the the perspective of like we are
[59:20] fighting a information Warfare and and
[59:23] we kind of have to stick out there and
[59:25] and and I think that's Al why uh it's
[59:28] such an open Community H and it's I get
[59:31] the warm wipes from from you and from
[59:32] Nik and from all the other content
[59:34] crators like there's zero competition
[59:36] between each other at least that's what
[59:38] I uh that my feeling was here when I
[59:40] came to the space it's like like hey I
[59:42] want to help you hey how can I
[59:44] contribute and stuff like that uh how do
[59:46] you see the Bitcoin Community the memes
[59:48] the digital soldiers all the things that
[59:49] I've mentioned yeah well first off I I I
[59:53] love memes you know life is memes and
[59:55] memes is is life it's memes all the way
[59:57] down literally what we're communicating
[60:00] in right now is memes it's called the
[60:02] English language it's all memes like
[60:04] everything is memes but yeah I'm just
[60:07] like I'm just on the internet too much
[60:09] and I I only I speak in like Zoomer I'm
[60:11] not even a Zoomer I'm a millennial and I
[60:14] only speak in memes you know I I
[60:15] literally like I I try to get the
[60:19] information and this is this is like my
[60:22] synopse of memes in general like we've
[60:24] said it on the show we've kind of uh Sun
[60:28] sunsetted the meme review on our show
[60:30] where we would show Bitcoin memes but I
[60:32] think memes are very important memes are
[60:35] by far one of the most important things
[60:37] in Bitcoin yes you know like actually
[60:40] building the technology and getting
[60:43] people to hold Bitcoins is very
[60:44] important but the power of memes cannot
[60:47] be understated like you said we are
[60:50] battling you know a trillion plus dollar
[60:53] scop campaign against the truth and
[60:56] that's what the powers that be have had
[60:59] for the longest time is this control
[61:01] over The Narrative of Truth or rather
[61:04] you know the the perception of what is
[61:06] true and you know for better or worse
[61:09] since 2016 since Trump came in and did
[61:11] the famous meme of fake news it
[61:14] fundamentally shifted the way people
[61:16] look at corporate press or what we kind
[61:18] of like to call it they're like they're
[61:20] pure State propaganda like there's no
[61:22] separation from the state apparatus and
[61:24] corporate press or you know the Deep
[61:27] state or whatever you want to call it
[61:28] the the the ABC agencies like they get
[61:31] their mandates from them and then they
[61:33] propagate them on the television and it
[61:35] reminds me of the the Batman movie with
[61:38] the Riddler where like everyone is you
[61:40] know watching the TV and they're all
[61:41] getting brainwashed and this is what
[61:43] we're fighting against and so the thing
[61:46] that is so powerful about memes or
[61:48] mimetic Warfare that we find ourselves
[61:50] on the front lines for is that Bitcoin
[61:53] memes or rather memes in general
[61:56] they have to
[61:57] one have truth in them they have to be
[62:01] truthful oh they I thought I turned that
[62:03] off they ha they have to have truth
[62:06] embedded in them so that they resonate
[62:08] with people and then further or rather
[62:11] educate people about something and then
[62:13] further you have to distill you know
[62:16] maybe a whole book or something a whole
[62:19] huge IDE a whole huge idea into a very
[62:23] short time frame and so if you're able
[62:26] to distill truth with as little words as
[62:30] possible and then that propagates you're
[62:32] literally you know in in this add very
[62:36] social media dopamine fried society that
[62:39] we live in propagating these memes and
[62:42] getting these memes in front of people
[62:45] very quickly and very efficiently that's
[62:47] how you're able to spread the truth
[62:49] around very quickly and get people up to
[62:52] be up to speed and yes you can kind of
[62:55] make fun of me memes because like I I
[62:57] have some Bitcoin friends that are like
[62:59] dude memes don't mean anything and then
[63:01] we're like no we we've Meed Bitcoin to
[63:04] 100K we're going to meme it to a million
[63:06] you know we've MD it to strategic
[63:08] Reserve asset and so I think memes are
[63:11] very important and going further one of
[63:13] my good
[63:14] friends he he did like he had this
[63:17] website and he would literally track um
[63:21] all of the
[63:23] military uh ageny papers about mimic
[63:26] Warfare and they're writing actual
[63:29] papers about mics and mimic Warfare and
[63:32] you know not to be a full conspiracy
[63:34] theories but we all know that there is
[63:36] you know a trillion plus dollar scop
[63:38] campaign that we all just live through
[63:41] and the only way they're able to
[63:43] propagate their narrative is through
[63:45] memes and so once you kind of really do
[63:48] understand that you're [ __ ] posting on
[63:49] Twitter you know the memes that you are
[63:51] creating the conversations you're having
[63:53] with friends like this does
[63:55] fundamentally changed the culture and
[63:58] this is what we are up against as
[64:01] bitcoiners as someone that believes in
[64:03] Freedom believes in truth doesn't
[64:05] believe in censorship believes that no
[64:08] Central entity can control the flow of
[64:10] information or the flow of the economy
[64:13] it's very important for us to understand
[64:15] that we are all nodes in the network
[64:17] like Bitcoin has nodes to propagate the
[64:20] Bitcoin Network we as individuals as
[64:23] still leaving living breathing thinking
[64:25] humans you are a node on the network and
[64:28] it is your duty to propagate the truth
[64:31] it is your duty to continue to spread
[64:33] what you believe is the truth obviously
[64:35] verifying it with your experience with
[64:37] your research and if you're able to
[64:39] distill that information and it
[64:41] resonates with other people then maybe
[64:44] you can wake up again you know we're all
[64:45] basically frequencies here and memes
[64:47] start to raise the vibrational
[64:50] consciousness of humanity and yes you
[64:53] know memes are fun you know they're very
[64:55] childish they're they're filled with
[64:57] humor sometimes they are ridiculous and
[65:00] mean but you're still able to propagate
[65:04] truth and to propagate information and
[65:06] if you can propagate the information
[65:09] very succinctly and pass it on to
[65:11] someone else and it's kind of like the
[65:12] telephone game and as it reaches another
[65:14] person in the network it reaches more
[65:16] people in the network and more people
[65:18] and more people and that's how we start
[65:21] to educate people is by more people
[65:23] waking up to what's going on
[65:26] understanding what the the playing field
[65:28] is that we currently find ourselves in
[65:31] and it really does feel since this you
[65:34] know election what three weeks ago that
[65:38] the the corporate press you know the the
[65:40] progressive media it does feel like
[65:43] they're starting to lose their power
[65:45] some some argue that they they're like
[65:47] completely done I'm not I'm not so
[65:50] convinced I think they still have a lot
[65:52] of power and magnitude in in uh what
[65:55] what they used to say uh freedom of
[65:58] speech not freedom of reach and so I
[66:00] think they still have a lot of reach in
[66:03] regards to most Normy people's minds
[66:06] like they still believe in the
[66:07] institutions if you say you know
[66:09] something came from CNN or Fox they're
[66:10] like oh it's the truth you know they
[66:12] wouldn't lie to me except for us
[66:14] bitcoiners were like dude they don't
[66:16] they don't talk about the truth they
[66:17] just they just spread propaganda they
[66:19] just spread their narratives and so you
[66:21] are on the front lines of this mtic war
[66:24] and it is a mic war against the truth
[66:27] and as a bitcoiner i fundamentally
[66:30] believe that Bitcoin kind of collapses
[66:34] this superficial 21st century social
[66:37] media Paradigm into reality again and
[66:41] we've been living in kind of a uh you
[66:43] know live it to Beaver um what's the
[66:46] what's a dang I'm blanking on that Jim
[66:48] Carrey movie right now where he's in the
[66:50] bubble oh uh Truman Show yeah exactly
[66:54] we're we're living in that like Truman
[66:56] showes Society where very few people
[67:01] understand the true nature of reality
[67:03] and now Bitcoin is kind of collapsing
[67:05] that you know facade down to reality and
[67:10] to succeed you have to align yourself
[67:12] with reality you have to align yourself
[67:14] with truth and those that are still
[67:17] anchored to the lies of the past it
[67:19] seems like they're starting to Fall by
[67:21] the wayside and so I'm very hopeful
[67:24] about the mimetic war that we find
[67:26] ourselves in not only because we're on
[67:28] the front lines and we have a job to
[67:30] continue to propagate this information
[67:32] and like this is our job to you know as
[67:34] the Hat say be the Bitcoin propaganda
[67:37] department but I really do believe that
[67:41] what we're doing is super important and
[67:43] trying to help people trying to wake
[67:45] people up trying to show people that
[67:48] there is an alternative and they don't
[67:50] have to live this meager existence where
[67:52] you know you're living paycheck to
[67:54] paycheck and you can barely pay rent and
[67:56] you know you're eating really poorly
[67:58] because you can't pay for eating good
[68:00] food and you're just barely surviving
[68:03] it's like once you can get past the
[68:05] survival level then you start to get to
[68:07] the level of thriving and I think that's
[68:09] what most bitcoiners feel it's like
[68:11] we're we're invigorated with life again
[68:13] because we have just woken up from the
[68:15] Matrix or you know it's like uh again
[68:18] cliche bit Corner talking about the
[68:19] Matrix but when Neo gets unplugged you
[68:22] know it's shocking it was like he he
[68:25] sees reality for the first time and he's
[68:27] unsettled and part of what we do with as
[68:30] bitcoiners and as and people that are
[68:32] doing memes and you know spreading my
[68:34] Medics is you're taking that person that
[68:37] just woke up and is unsettled and you're
[68:39] kind of like being like it's okay bro
[68:41] like I I remember when I was you like
[68:43] trust me it gets better and you just got
[68:46] to follow you know the protocols follow
[68:48] follow the the good fundamentals and
[68:51] first principles and your life's going
[68:53] to like improve and really that's that's
[68:57] one of the things that I love the most
[68:58] about what I do every day and and even
[69:00] coming on here with you like I always
[69:02] think of it very simply like what would
[69:04] I tell myself at 18 that would have
[69:08] basically allowed me to buy byep all of
[69:12] the stuff that that I did that wasn't
[69:14] fruitful for my life like I literally
[69:16] just talk to myself as an 18-year-old
[69:18] you know I'm I'm a millennial I'm I'm in
[69:20] my in my early 30s so like I'm always
[69:23] just thinking like how can I communicate
[69:25] this in a way where someone that is you
[69:28] know either younger than me or you know
[69:30] not to say like I'm ahead in the race
[69:32] but like behind in the race of
[69:34] understanding Bitcoin is like how do I
[69:36] get this message across so that they can
[69:38] also start to live a better life because
[69:40] bitcoin's allowed me to live an
[69:42] incredible life so far like I've said it
[69:44] in the past on other podcasts like
[69:45] Bitcoin saved my life like legitimately
[69:48] full stop saved my life I was not happy
[69:51] in the Fiat world before I was working a
[69:54] job I didn't like I I couldn't you know
[69:56] I could never save more than like $200
[69:59] in in in cash I would always spend my
[70:01] money it seemed like a very deadend
[70:05] existence even though I knew there was
[70:07] more and I and like I I'm a I'm a
[70:09] philosopher of my trades like literally
[70:11] I'm have a bachelor's in philosophy and
[70:13] so I like knew there's more to life but
[70:15] then you get to like reality and you're
[70:17] like man I can't ever get out of the Rat
[70:19] Race like I can't get off the hamster
[70:21] wheel and then you find Bitcoin and it's
[70:23] that's why I think so many bitcoiners
[70:26] kind of have this like coming to Jesus
[70:28] like uh you know Born Again Jesus moment
[70:31] where you find out about Bitcoin it
[70:32] clicks and then you're like telling
[70:34] everyone like I can save you like save
[70:36] yourself we can save you you just need
[70:38] to save in Bitcoin and you kind of come
[70:40] across like crazy or overbearing and now
[70:43] I I'm really kind of leaning into and
[70:45] it's full circle to the culture aspect
[70:47] of this where I think the best way to
[70:51] lead the culture is by you living and
[70:54] being a a real Flesh and Blood example
[70:57] of what it means to be not only a good
[70:59] human but a good bitcoiner and if you
[71:02] are at this point in life where like you
[71:05] see one side of the aisle they're very
[71:07] you know nihilistic they're unhealthy
[71:10] they aren't hopeful they're pessimistic
[71:12] about the future and then you see the
[71:13] other side which is like bitcoiners
[71:14] that're like they're healthy they're
[71:17] vibrant you know they're they're
[71:18] financially well off they're having
[71:20] families and you're like either you can
[71:23] look at bitcoiners and hate them or you
[71:25] can look at them and be like wait I want
[71:27] a good life like I think everyone just
[71:29] wants to have a good life and I think
[71:31] Bitcoin is a tool for us to live a
[71:33] better life and I think that is the best
[71:36] way to win the culture forward as
[71:38] bitcoiners start to increase their
[71:40] purchasing power and their status in
[71:42] life other people are going to look to
[71:43] bit corners and be like I want that what
[71:46] do I what do I need to do to live a
[71:47] better life like what do I need to do to
[71:49] to be a healthier person what do I need
[71:51] to do to have you know loving and
[71:54] compassionate relationship ship and it's
[71:56] like bro just like take a step back work
[71:59] your job sacrifice a little bit saving
[72:01] Bitcoin and trust me your life is going
[72:04] to be better like just stop stop
[72:06] participating in the lies of the Fiat
[72:08] system and come join us in the truth
[72:10] like it's so much
[72:12] nicer I love that is it is it fair to
[72:15] say that uh Bitcoin made you a better
[72:18] better human being uh yes yes and no I
[72:22] mean I I I I think it I would say yes
[72:25] first of all yes obviously I'm I'm still
[72:28] a human I have my flaws you know I'm not
[72:30] I'm not perfect I don't ever claim to be
[72:32] perfect but I do think it did kind of
[72:36] make me a better person because before
[72:38] before I found bit or rather before
[72:40] Bitcoin actually clicked I was very
[72:42] lethargic I I didn't want to work I I
[72:45] like you know I was very nihilistic I I
[72:48] I thought I I thought everything was
[72:49] kind of pointless in the in the world
[72:51] you know in the rat race I'm like what's
[72:53] the point of doing this like I'm up I'm
[72:55] tired I I don't want to go to work I'm
[72:58] like I what's the point of this like
[73:00] what again I'm a philosopher by trade
[73:02] and I and I only fell into philosophy
[73:04] because I wanted to answer simple
[73:05] questions like why am I alive what's the
[73:07] point of being here like you know simple
[73:09] questions I don't know like what's the
[73:11] like you know is there a God all this
[73:12] stuff like you know I just wanted to to
[73:15] understand what it was to be a human and
[73:18] when you are in the fiop system you you
[73:21] definitely get beat down and nihilistic
[73:23] and you know you don't want to work you
[73:25] get lazy you just start to kind of tune
[73:27] out and ignore a lot of things and now
[73:29] that as as a bitcoiner and someone that
[73:31] runs a Bitcoin company like yes you know
[73:34] Mondays are still a little hard because
[73:36] it's like start of the work week it it
[73:38] always still feels like work but now I'm
[73:40] like invigorated it's like every day
[73:42] it's just man how can we continue to
[73:45] just keep killing it and keep building
[73:47] our business and get myself healthy
[73:50] because I need to usher in these STS for
[73:52] the long term you know I don't want to
[73:54] be one of these guys
[73:55] like I've been watching Dr Jack Cruz
[73:57] recently and I I don't want to be one of
[73:58] these Tech forward people that dies at
[74:00] like 56 I'm like I want to be here for
[74:03] the long run you know I want to be 80
[74:05] plus years old and see what Bitcoin does
[74:08] to the world so I would argue yes to to
[74:12] an extent but obviously it's not like
[74:14] this huge transformation like you know
[74:16] saved by Jesus moment in Bitcoin because
[74:19] you know I I don't really believe like
[74:21] the Bitcoin is God meem but it it has
[74:23] fundamentally like superar me where like
[74:26] I think of the future I want to be an
[74:28] old person like I want to have a family
[74:31] I want to usher in these sets you know I
[74:33] want to build a good business and it's
[74:36] because you know I'm incentivized to I
[74:38] want to Stack more sets you know like
[74:40] yes finally you kind of have that like
[74:42] rocket feel put in you to actually
[74:45] produce and contribute to society
[74:47] whereas before I wasn't contributing to
[74:50] society I just like you know I I I'm
[74:53] just like give me give me what I'm give
[74:54] me what I'm owed and like you know F off
[74:57] basically now I'm like all right how
[74:59] much can I contribute to society because
[75:02] I have the I don't know if I knew this
[75:03] before Bitcoin or after Bitcoin but I
[75:06] fundamentally believe that the you know
[75:08] the richest people on planet Earth if
[75:10] you kind of you know separate the
[75:12] parasite that is the money printer but
[75:14] most of the rich people on planet Earth
[75:17] are those that provide the most value to
[75:19] their fellow man and I fundamentally
[75:21] believe that that is something that
[75:23] Bitcoin sparked in me where it's like
[75:25] okay you know you want you want to get
[75:27] rich uh you provide value to your fellow
[75:29] man and if you can provide the most
[75:31] value to your fellow man then you are
[75:34] rewarded in things called money and we
[75:36] have the best money and I want to be
[75:39] rewarded in the best money because you
[75:40] know I I do think highly of myself so
[75:43] part of me is like yes Bitcoin did make
[75:45] me a better person the other part of me
[75:47] is like I don't know I I feel like I'm
[75:49] more of an extremist now so I'm I'm try
[75:53] I'm trying to balance out like I'm very
[75:55] extreme in a lot of my thinking uh again
[75:58] because I know I'm right you know so
[76:00] like I'm I'm trying to stay humble here
[76:03] yeah it's um I sometimes wonder how much
[76:06] is contributed to the fact that we are
[76:07] so early in a a really
[76:09] revolutionary uh movement and because we
[76:13] are like uh we are in an environment
[76:16] where so many critical thinkers are so
[76:18] many brave people are and and this kind
[76:20] of pushes us to the limits like if
[76:22] someone comes new in there he's all of
[76:24] the sudden in a way better environment
[76:26] than he probably was before and this
[76:28] pushes yourself and how much is to the
[76:31] new incentive set of what Bitcoin
[76:33] actually does to you so uh it it kind of
[76:36] feels like Bitcoin is a new way of life
[76:39] but but maybe that's just be because we
[76:41] earlier it's really fascinating also to
[76:43] to see uh your life uh transformed into
[76:46] thata really really cool yeah well no
[76:49] Robin I I think I would fully agree with
[76:51] that that Bitcoin is a new way of life
[76:54] um because it is a hard money standard
[76:57] and again kind of going back to the
[76:59] cultural aspect of this is um I forget
[77:01] what the quote is but uh
[77:04] culture culture is Downstream from
[77:06] politics or is it cult culture is
[77:08] Upstream from politics I forget I forget
[77:10] what what it is but essentially you know
[77:13] by changing the culture you change the
[77:14] outcome of society and as you can see
[77:17] right now we are living in you know
[77:19] people like to call it the Fiat Society
[77:21] or a very superficial you know uh
[77:25] plastic Society however you want to
[77:27] frame it and you know you could also
[77:30] argue that a lot of politicians are
[77:33] incentivized to be liars and thiefs
[77:35] because of the Fiat incentives and now
[77:37] having a hard money standard where money
[77:39] doesn't just literally get printed out
[77:41] of nowhere uh you have to fundamentally
[77:43] change who you are to adapt to that new
[77:47] reality and so you do see that it does
[77:50] seem to kind of like change a lot about
[77:53] you and and I think this is for the
[77:56] better and if us bitcoiners as
[77:59] individuals can kind of maintain our
[78:03] trajectory and impact on society and
[78:06] grow as the Bitcoin movement grows and
[78:09] you know the the new top influencers are
[78:11] bitcoiners then that will fundamentally
[78:13] change how Society works and how the
[78:16] fabric of society is kind of put
[78:18] together and I think that is like the
[78:20] long-term game here where you know as as
[78:24] Rob podcast gets bigger here you know as
[78:27] you start to overtake Joe Rogan as the
[78:30] podcaster you know like you get to talk
[78:33] about the things you like and part of
[78:35] that is Bitcoin and if we have the
[78:37] influence of I forget what his viewers
[78:39] are but like 30 million viewers on this
[78:42] show like these ideas start to take hold
[78:45] and people start to fundamentally change
[78:47] their world view and you know we could
[78:49] potentially head into some kind of
[78:52] future that we couldn't even imagine
[78:54] that you know like right now it's like
[78:57] unimaginable to see a million bit a
[78:59] million dollar per Bitcoin next year but
[79:01] hey if enough enough people believe it's
[79:04] coming and they're all piling into
[79:06] Bitcoin like we could meme it you know
[79:07] in a year H but we don't have that
[79:10] following yet and we're not that big yet
[79:12] but I do believe that just these
[79:15] conversations and one by one and all of
[79:18] us kind of changing ourselves and our
[79:20] friends around us this is how we change
[79:23] the culture it's kind of like a you know
[79:25] the Michael Jackson song like look at
[79:26] the man in the mirror first and change
[79:28] yourself you know that's the only thing
[79:30] we can do is is fundamentally change
[79:32] ourselves and the opposite is people
[79:35] wanting to change other people and I'm
[79:37] I'm like I think I might have believed
[79:39] that when I was younger and now I'm like
[79:41] the only thing in control is my behavior
[79:44] and what I ingest on social media and
[79:47] what I'm reading and what I'm saying and
[79:50] so I'm really like you know doing the
[79:52] internal work this whole Bitcoin Journey
[79:53] for me is like doing the internal work
[79:55] is like am I the person that I portray
[79:58] myself to be and also am I worthy of
[80:01] ushering in these sets like these STS
[80:03] are invaluable and I'm am I worthy of
[80:05] holding them and if I'm not then hey
[80:07] I'll end up with the stack that I
[80:09] deserve and if I am and maybe more so
[80:11] maybe the stack will increase so it is
[80:14] kind of one of those uh like Crystal
[80:16] moments it's it's you know like once you
[80:19] once you step or like the interstellar
[80:21] moment you know once you step into the
[80:24] the Cosmic like are you actually who you
[80:26] think you are and are you really going
[80:29] or like Space Odyssey 2001 as you can
[80:31] tell I love Sci-Fi movies so like you
[80:33] know you see yourself and you see all of
[80:35] the cosmos and it's like am I am I the
[80:38] guy that I think I am and I think
[80:40] Bitcoin is that like testing metal that
[80:43] that will show you to you and I think
[80:46] that's what most of us want to want to
[80:48] know and do is like am I you know am I
[80:50] dope am am I actually as dope as I think
[80:52] I am or am I a lar I I don't that's what
[80:55] I think about constantly it's like man
[80:57] uh we seem to have something going at
[80:58] simply Bitcoin we're super hyped and
[81:00] super humble and it seems surreal and
[81:03] now it's like okay well we're in this
[81:05] position or like you yourself you know
[81:07] you came on the scene kind of strong
[81:08] this year and like you're working your
[81:11] ass off and you're probably still asking
[81:13] yourself like man is this G to pay off
[81:15] and like just keep going dude like who
[81:17] knows how big it can get and who knows
[81:19] how many people you can impact and
[81:21] change their lives and like that's one
[81:23] of the things that really is incredible
[81:26] to me is just people coming up to us and
[81:29] being like dude you changed our lives
[81:31] like you really changed how I view the
[81:34] world and you're like man that's so
[81:36] humbling because we're just like I'm
[81:38] just in my room talking and do a
[81:39] computer you know I'm just losing my
[81:40] mind in front of a computer and you
[81:42] forget other people are are taking value
[81:45] from this and being like man he's a cool
[81:47] dude and I relate to his story and okay
[81:49] you know in seven years or five years
[81:53] you know if they're like 2020 coiners
[81:55] Etc they're like man okay maybe in 5
[81:57] years I can also be doing something
[81:59] really cool and impactful and it's like
[82:01] that's all we can ask for is to spread
[82:04] the good word and uh you know keep
[82:07] people optimistic and and stacking as
[82:09] much Bitcoin as possible yeah I think
[82:12] sometimes we forget that there are
[82:14] people listening to
[82:15] us at least for me that's why I love
[82:18] going to conferences I'm I'm going more
[82:21] more bullish and and deeper on
[82:22] conferences wasn't in Salvador wasn't in
[82:24] Amsterdam I will be soon in Abu Dhabi
[82:27] I'm really looking forward to just like
[82:29] having the people there um yeah
[82:32] beautiful uh we we come to the endou of
[82:34] the podcast where there's one question
[82:36] that ask each and every one of my guest
[82:39] they kind of maybe it was already in
[82:41] there but uh what can we learn from you
[82:44] besides Bitcoin um what can they learn
[82:47] from me uh just lean into lean into the
[82:51] crazy like lean into saying the saying
[82:55] the thing that can't be said obviously
[82:58] within the Overton window and without
[83:01] like blowing up your life and you know
[83:03] trying to be too edgy but I think one of
[83:06] the things that is missing in the world
[83:08] right now is true
[83:09] authenticity and I've noticed for me
[83:12] personally you know like I just have fun
[83:14] I joke about it all the time I like I
[83:15] just black out on simply Bitcoin every
[83:17] day like I drink coffee go on the show
[83:19] and I pop out an hour later like oh what
[83:21] did I say was it good so it's just like
[83:23] lean into authenticity like lean into
[83:26] what excites you the most lean into the
[83:29] people that you know get you energetic
[83:33] and excited and like shun the stuff that
[83:36] feels like it's a duty like turn away
[83:38] from the stuff that feels like it's
[83:40] taking your energy and if you follow
[83:42] your intuition and your gut long enough
[83:45] you might end up at something incredible
[83:47] and it's really about kind of exposing
[83:51] people to themselves and being like look
[83:54] if you are
[83:55] listening if you are listening to this
[83:57] podcast you still have a brain in
[84:00] critical thinking use it like you
[84:02] understand what's going on use your
[84:04] internal Compass like you don't have to
[84:07] you know look for exterior dang I'm
[84:09] blanking on it you don't have to look at
[84:11] uh exterior event stimuli exterior
[84:14] stimuli to tell you you are the truth
[84:16] and what you're saying is true and what
[84:18] you believe is true like just go you
[84:21] know just send it like your gut knows
[84:23] what is going on
[84:25] like you know a little more craziness in
[84:26] the world in in a good way not like you
[84:28] know actual craziness but like a little
[84:31] more eccentricity I think is a good
[84:33] thing be authentically you and
[84:37] everything will be good just send it
[84:39] life is great trust the process and man
[84:43] you know uh the life you dream of is
[84:46] only on the other side of fear so just
[84:48] send it everything will be good you know
[84:50] trust in the higher power trust in in uh
[84:53] hate to get wooow woo but you know trust
[84:54] in The Power of Love here and you will
[84:57] be in okay place like do things for the
[85:00] betterment of humanity and I think
[85:02] everything will will check out in the
[85:04] end so man just full send it you know
[85:06] what to do you know what to
[85:09] do that's beautiful op really really
[85:11] cool I love that a lot um we we have the
[85:14] other end routine where the the previous
[85:16] guest is asking a question for the next
[85:18] guest without knowing who the next guest
[85:19] actually is it I guess it will be a
[85:22] short one because you don't know the
[85:24] answer of that I guess who is sat
[85:26] Nakamoto I have no idea it's a I don't
[85:30] know I like to think it's a group of
[85:31] people actually you know I know it's
[85:33] wrapping up here but I like to think
[85:35] that Satoshi Nakamoto was an AI to
[85:37] bootstrap Bitcoin I I like the most
[85:39] Cosmic view here like you know I I don't
[85:42] know I who knows man all we do know is
[85:45] it wasn't Craig
[85:47] right he he he went ahead and really
[85:51] tried hard to prove that he's not s
[85:53] Nakamoto he really want to prove to the
[85:55] world that that he's not it no I I'm not
[85:58] going to get into it but I do have a
[86:00] funny theory around the Craig right Saga
[86:03] um actually maybe I'll say it anyways
[86:04] like I I I do find it kind of funny like
[86:07] maybe Craig Wright trying to claim he
[86:09] was Satoshi was a good way to kick
[86:11] people off the trail that he might
[86:13] actually be Satoshi I'm not saying he
[86:15] was I'm just saying he's doing a good
[86:17] job of proving he's not like that's some
[86:20] pretty good obsc here you want to you
[86:21] want to kick people off the trail
[86:24] act like a lunatic and then no one's
[86:26] going to believe you so hey you never
[86:27] know I'm that's oh gosh that that that's
[86:30] um I think that's the best theory I ever
[86:32] heard that could convince me that greig
[86:35] R might actually be
[86:37] aoto hey I thought so too really really
