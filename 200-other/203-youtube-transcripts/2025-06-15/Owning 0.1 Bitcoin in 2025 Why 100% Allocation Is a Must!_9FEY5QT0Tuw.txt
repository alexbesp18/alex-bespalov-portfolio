[00:00] You know, in 15 years, we've gone from
[00:02] the government will ban it to the
[00:04] government will buy it. And that trend
[00:06] continues to happen. You have to take
[00:07] notice and you've got to start making at
[00:10] least some type of allocation. There's
[00:11] there's really no excuse for these
[00:13] people to have a 0% allocation to
[00:15] Bitcoin. My newsletter is called Fire
[00:17] BTC. Every week I write about how
[00:20] Bitcoiners can achieve financial
[00:21] independence and how uh FIRE
[00:23] practitioners can incorporate Bitcoin
[00:25] into their plan. when we hit 100,000 and
[00:28] your, you know, five Bitcoin or whatever
[00:30] that you're sitting on is now worth a
[00:32] good amount of money. You know, these
[00:34] very highpowered people who have a lot
[00:36] of money, they're subject to the same
[00:38] emotional drag and emotional pull that
[00:40] that we all are.
[00:43] [Music]
[00:46] Hi, Trey. How are you doing? Everything
[00:47] fine on your end? Everything is great.
[00:50] uh you know we're in this lull in the
[00:53] Bitcoin market for some reason that
[00:56] defies fundamentals I think uh and you
[01:00] know uh Unchained business is definitely
[01:02] correlated to the price of Bitcoin. It
[01:04] always has been. I I suspect that will
[01:06] continue for quite a while which gives
[01:09] me a little bit of extra breathing room
[01:11] to be able to focus on some other
[01:12] priorities and um talking to clients
[01:15] that I haven't followed up with in a
[01:16] while. um and then working on some other
[01:19] projects and that kind of thing. So, uh
[01:20] it's it's a welcome relief from the buzz
[01:23] of when the bull market is in full force
[01:26] or when we've got these like euphoric
[01:27] waves of the price moving up and people
[01:30] um are just hammering down our door and
[01:33] trying to make sure they can talk to
[01:34] somebody so they can get their Bitcoin
[01:36] secured before it's worth a million
[01:37] dollars a coin or something like that,
[01:39] right? So, it's uh it's been it's been
[01:42] nice to get a little bit of breathing
[01:43] room and I think we're probably on the
[01:45] cusp here of the next the next leg up.
[01:47] We'll we'll have to wait and see though.
[01:49] Yeah, it's super interesting uh how
[01:52] businesses are correlated to the Bitcoin
[01:54] price. Actually, also March was uh from
[01:57] a few standpoint uh from a podcast also
[02:01] really low there has been some other
[02:03] changes that I have done to the podcast.
[02:04] So I'm not 100% sure if it's if if it's
[02:07] correlated, but I've actually just heard
[02:09] it from across the board of businesses
[02:11] and other things like, oh yeah, like the
[02:13] the price is kind of unexciting. Uh and
[02:16] uh I don't know if you also see that
[02:18] with Unchained, but usually um the price
[02:22] has to do something up or down and it's
[02:24] good. Uh is that something volatility is
[02:26] definitely our friend? Uh it's better
[02:28] when it goes up, right? people are
[02:30] generally in a better mood. But, you
[02:32] know, when the price is going down and
[02:34] it's going down rapidly, people get the
[02:37] urge to buy very quickly, right? And so,
[02:40] uh there's there's a sense of urgency
[02:41] that they want to uh express in getting
[02:44] set up so that they can purchase some
[02:46] Bitcoin and and get that initial
[02:47] allocation. Um we see a lot of like new
[02:50] people coming in with that type of a
[02:52] mentality when the price is going down.
[02:54] But generally speaking, that works the
[02:56] same way when the price is going up as
[02:58] well and people have an urgency to buy.
[03:00] Uh, and they're also worried about
[03:02] making sure that, you know, their their
[03:04] Bitcoin is fully secured in a way that's
[03:07] going to help them plan for succession
[03:09] and all that as the value of it starts
[03:11] to hit them kind of over the head. uh
[03:14] you know when when we hit 100,000 and
[03:16] your you know five Bitcoin or whatever
[03:18] that you're sitting on is now worth a a
[03:21] good amount of money you are starting to
[03:24] take these ideas a little bit more
[03:26] seriously because it can feel like a gut
[03:28] punch that causes you to lose sleep if
[03:30] you don't actually take care of it. So
[03:32] um it's a lot of fun either way. uh we
[03:33] we love volatility
[03:36] and and I want to get into fire uh for
[03:39] for the topic of today uh in a in a
[03:41] moment but one thing uh I'm just curious
[03:44] about that because I know from uh some
[03:46] exchanges for example relay or 21
[03:48] bitcoin they're reporting those numbers
[03:50] and and and I talked to the the cos
[03:52] there and they said when the price dips
[03:56] dramatically
[03:57] uh they usually have the highest volumes
[04:00] of buys. Uh so actually for them is when
[04:03] there's a massive dip. Uh it's usually
[04:06] even better day for them just in uh the
[04:08] buy volume and they make the like they
[04:11] have a fee and and and the more people
[04:13] buy that obviously it's good for the
[04:14] business. Um do you see the same thing
[04:16] in Unchained if there's like a dip but
[04:19] you're not an exchange so you you
[04:20] probably have like some somewhere
[04:22] somewhere along this. Why are you also
[04:24] exchanged? Did I got that wrong? Yeah,
[04:27] for for our US-based clients, you can
[04:29] buy and sell Bitcoin directly with
[04:31] Unchained, right? And so, you're buying
[04:33] the Bitcoin and then we deposit it
[04:35] directly into your collaborative custody
[04:37] vault. Uh, which is a really nice
[04:38] experience. Um, you can typically act
[04:40] very quickly because we're dealing with
[04:42] wire transfers and you can keep cash in
[04:44] your account and just be ready to jump
[04:46] on that dip whenever it happens. But
[04:49] you're you're absolutely right. We see
[04:50] the same thing where people are there
[04:52] there are a lot of newcomers into
[04:54] Bitcoin, especially now, who have been
[04:57] kind of watching on the sidelines and
[04:58] they're, you know, it's it's the the a
[05:02] very normal thing for people to watch it
[05:04] go up very drastically and feel a little
[05:07] bit of FOMO and then they say to
[05:09] themselves, okay, if we get a drop, then
[05:12] I'm going to start allocating a little
[05:13] bit. Right? And sometimes that works out
[05:15] for people and other times it doesn't,
[05:17] right? because the price doesn't quite
[05:18] drop down to where they actually want to
[05:20] buy. Sometimes your emotions get the
[05:22] best of you. It's dropped down from
[05:24] 100,000 to 80 and then you're like,
[05:25] "Okay, well, I'll buy it when it goes to
[05:28] 70." But then it maybe never goes to 70
[05:30] and you miss out on your chance to
[05:31] actually start that allocation. So,
[05:33] different people have different ways
[05:35] that they approach um that that initial
[05:38] allocation. What I typically tell my
[05:40] friends and family when they're asking
[05:42] me about Bitcoin and starting to think
[05:43] about it is, hey, just like whatever the
[05:45] price is today, you've made that
[05:47] decision, just buy half of whatever
[05:48] you're thinking about buying right now.
[05:50] Um, this is not financial advice. It's
[05:52] just what I tend to tell people, right?
[05:54] Uh, is is that this threads the the it
[05:58] it threads the needle on making sure
[06:00] that you get allocated right away. um
[06:03] but then can deal with the volatility
[06:05] with the other half that's happening
[06:07] there. Then just dollar cost average
[06:09] that over the course of you know 10
[06:10] weeks or whatever you're comfortable
[06:12] with doing. Um so that you know if the
[06:14] price does go against you after you've
[06:16] made that first purchase you don't feel
[06:18] like you've like fully missed out on
[06:19] that opportunity. Uh or if it goes up
[06:22] you know after that initial purchase you
[06:25] at least have some of that allocation in
[06:26] there and you can enjoy the the
[06:28] increased purchasing power that that you
[06:29] get from having that that allocation.
[06:32] So, I think that strikes the right
[06:33] balance, but you know, everybody's
[06:34] different. If you're really running the
[06:36] numbers, a lump sum almost always makes
[06:39] the most sense. You could say the same
[06:41] thing for buying in the stock market,
[06:43] right? Um, you know, there's these
[06:45] regression analysis that that have been
[06:47] done in the past that say the same thing
[06:49] is is that you're better off just
[06:52] lumpsuming when you've got some kind of
[06:54] of cash available there. Uh, but that's
[06:56] emotionally difficult for a lot of
[06:58] people. it's emotionally difficult for
[06:59] me and I've been around this for a very
[07:00] long time, right? Um you just you just
[07:02] don't want to be in that situation where
[07:04] you feel uh distraught about the fact
[07:07] that oh man I bought this and then the
[07:09] next day it goes down by 30%. Which is
[07:12] somewhat likely to have happen.
[07:16] It's it's super interesting the
[07:18] emotional and the um the the mental game
[07:22] of investing and I saw it so many times
[07:26] with myself when I was picking stocks.
[07:29] Uh now with Bitcoin it's easy. I I I
[07:32] just get paid in Bitcoin and I have to
[07:34] convert this this Bitcoin and fiat when
[07:36] I when I need fiat. Uh which made
[07:38] investing in Bitcoin super easy now.
[07:40] Yeah. But uh when I picked stocks there
[07:43] was this like oh which price do I pick
[07:46] uh and how much do I do and and what is
[07:49] my diversification across different
[07:50] stocks. uh and I saw so many friends of
[07:54] saying oh I want to buy that stock at
[07:56] that price then it reached that price
[07:59] and then because the stock was in a
[08:01] crash there was bad news coming out then
[08:03] they were not sure anymore about the
[08:05] thesis and I think the same thing is
[08:07] happening with Bitcoin crashes from 100k
[08:09] to 80k people are like but but maybe
[08:13] maybe it's now going to zero like I'm
[08:15] not so sure about my thesis anymore it
[08:18] it's super interesting the mental aim
[08:21] around investing. Yeah. And and very
[08:25] seasoned and wealthy people allocators
[08:30] are not immune from this either, right?
[08:31] You might think that, oh, we're we're
[08:33] the plebs here and we're not, you know,
[08:35] necessarily allocating millions of
[08:37] dollars or tens of millions or hundreds
[08:39] of millions or billions of dollars to
[08:40] Bitcoin. Uh but the same emotional pulls
[08:44] are happening with these people as well.
[08:46] I was speaking to a group of uh
[08:49] attorneys and wealth adviserss who
[08:52] manage the finances and the overall
[08:55] infrastructure, personal finances and
[08:58] estate plans and that kind of thing for
[09:00] billiondoll family offices uh billion
[09:02] billion dollar families um this this
[09:05] past weekend and they have all of the
[09:07] same questions about Bitcoin, all the
[09:10] same concerns around volatility that all
[09:14] of us have had from time to time and
[09:16] they're starting to think about this
[09:18] allocation. It was a a very electric
[09:20] conversation and there are a lot of
[09:22] questions brewing. Um, but they're all
[09:24] the same questions, right? There's not,
[09:26] even though I'm in this room full of
[09:27] very sophisticated capital allocators
[09:30] and advisers and people who work with
[09:33] these very wealthy families um on a
[09:35] day-to-day basis and they have very
[09:37] complex setups for their estates. Uh,
[09:40] the the same questions continue to arise
[09:43] as people are new to Bitcoin. They're
[09:45] trying to understand what is the utility
[09:47] of Bitcoin like why should I even pay
[09:50] attention to this at all like what is
[09:52] the regulatory landscape a lot of those
[09:54] questions have been answered in the last
[09:56] few weeks uh and and really that risk uh
[09:59] factor has been uh has been essentially
[10:02] neutered with the the recent US
[10:05] administration uh and then it's about
[10:07] volatility right and then it's about
[10:09] what is the opportunity what kind of
[10:11] position sizing should I actually have
[10:13] as I think about incorporating this into
[10:16] the the larger profile of an investment
[10:19] portfolio. And so, you know, these very
[10:22] highpowered people who have a lot of
[10:24] money, they're subject to the same
[10:26] emotional drag and emotional pull that
[10:28] that we all are. And when you start
[10:30] thinking about this from a FIRE
[10:32] perspective, that's why this idea around
[10:35] dollar cost averaging and automating
[10:37] your investments or automating the
[10:39] savings that you're doing is so powerful
[10:42] because as you were saying, if you are
[10:45] sitting on a piece of like a a a
[10:47] mountain of cash or a little bit of cash
[10:50] and you're thinking about, okay, where
[10:51] do I put this? Now, all of a sudden,
[10:53] you're starting to introduce emotion
[10:56] into the process, which you just can't
[10:58] help but do. Uh whereas if you automate
[11:00] that process, if you're getting paid in
[11:02] Bitcoin, you you've kind of got this
[11:04] automated process of dollar cost
[11:06] averaging, you don't have to think about
[11:08] it. And if you don't have to think about
[11:09] it, then the emotion is kind of stripped
[11:12] away and allows you to allocate uh on a
[11:16] regular basis and in a way that feels
[11:18] more comfortable and feels uh more
[11:20] emotionally acceptable to most people.
[11:24] It's also the switch from thinking in
[11:28] Bitcoin and Satoshi uh versus thinking
[11:30] in US dollar. I saw that over and over
[11:33] again where people feel down if their
[11:36] investment is down and their Bitcoin is
[11:38] down in US dollar uh and they feel
[11:41] really good about themselves and feel
[11:42] like oh like we did something really
[11:44] good if the Bitcoin price is going 30%
[11:46] up. But the truth in the end of the day
[11:48] is you have Bitcoin and if it's going
[11:52] down 30%, you're not dumber 30%, and if
[11:55] it's going up 30%, you're not smarter
[11:57] 30%. It's just uh the paper value of
[12:00] your bitcoin is going up and down and
[12:02] you might be able to buy more and sell
[12:05] or or buy less from your bitcoin and the
[12:08] purchasing power is also of course uh in
[12:11] there but it doesn't say anything about
[12:16] yourself and I think a lot of people
[12:18] take what they are worth on on paper
[12:21] what they're worth with their bitcoin
[12:23] and how many bitcoin they have really
[12:25] personal and and uh you definitely have
[12:29] that that security. Uh and I'm really
[12:31] interested in in that mental game and in
[12:34] that emotional investment in your own
[12:37] Bitcoin stack for Bitcoiners because
[12:40] I've seen it all over again in the
[12:42] community. One one thing that I found
[12:44] for me personally and for the people
[12:46] that I that I talk to about this stuff
[12:48] is that actually when the price is going
[12:50] higher, it's ripping higher and there's
[12:52] a lot of enthusiasm in the market and on
[12:55] X and like all this stuff, it's actually
[12:57] much easier to allocate large amounts of
[12:59] capital because you feel like you you
[13:03] you've got this FOMO kicking in and you
[13:06] are more action driven to just make sure
[13:08] that you get that allocation happening.
[13:11] uh and when the price is going the
[13:13] opposite direction, people start getting
[13:15] scared. So even though when you when the
[13:19] price is ripping and you're allocating
[13:20] larger amounts of capital into this
[13:22] thing, even though it um you know might
[13:25] not work out and go against you, you
[13:28] actually end up a lot of times with more
[13:31] sats at the end of the day than if you
[13:33] had been quote unquote smart and waited
[13:36] for a pullback. because when that
[13:37] pullback inevitably happens at that
[13:39] point you're no longer feeling so
[13:41] confident about putting in this larger
[13:43] amount of capital at which point you're
[13:45] going to miss miss the boat again right
[13:48] and just not have that not have that
[13:50] capital allocated at the appropriate
[13:51] time um so I've found at least for
[13:53] myself that it's kind of okay to lean
[13:56] into that FOMO and that enthusiasm uh
[13:59] because it allows me to get a larger
[14:02] allocation than I would otherwise have
[14:04] when it's much more difficult to push
[14:07] the chips into the table when the price
[14:09] is crashing to 25,000 or or something
[14:11] like that like like it did a few years
[14:13] ago. And then there's always this memes
[14:16] coming out when the Bitcoin price is is
[14:18] dipping and I like oh bye bye bye and
[14:20] I'm like I don't I don't have fear with
[14:24] what I cannot do anything. Yeah. Yeah.
[14:27] It's painful. It definitely could be
[14:28] painful, but uh it's also exciting, you
[14:30] know, and if you understand the use case
[14:33] for Bitcoin, the utility that I was
[14:35] talking to these family office
[14:36] representatives about, and you
[14:38] understand that this volatility is
[14:39] natural and is actually inescapable, if
[14:42] you're talking about an asset going from
[14:44] 0 to2 trillion to hundred trillion or
[14:46] wherever it will end up going, uh then
[14:48] you can sleep a little bit easier. Uh,
[14:50] so as long as you're, you know, and
[14:53] especially if you've got that dollar
[14:54] cost averaging function in place, either
[14:57] from getting paid in Bitcoin the way
[14:58] that you are or just from taking your
[15:00] paycheck and a certain portion of that
[15:02] that works within your personal finance
[15:04] situation, and it's just kind of
[15:06] automatically happening, you're you're
[15:08] going to you're going to take advantage
[15:10] of those uh price drops without having
[15:13] to feel like uh you have to think too
[15:15] hard about it and and overcome the
[15:17] emotional barriers that that come with
[15:19] uh that that volatility. One thing that
[15:21] is really connected to that and which we
[15:23] also want to talk about today is fire
[15:26] and retire on Bitcoin. So fire meaning
[15:30] uh the financial independence retire
[15:33] early if I if I got that right and and
[15:35] and basically the retirement on on
[15:38] Bitcoin topic uh because it ties into
[15:40] personal finance a lot. Um for the
[15:43] people that aren't aware of of fire uh
[15:46] what is fire and what is the fire
[15:48] community all about? Yeah, you got it
[15:50] right. Stands for financial
[15:51] independence, retire early. Uh it's a
[15:53] movement that was kind of started in I
[15:56] don't know maybe 101 15 years ago. Uh
[15:59] one of the key influential figures is a
[16:01] guy by the name of Mr. money mustache.
[16:03] And uh he had this blog talking about
[16:06] how you can basically save money very
[16:09] actively, very proactively, be very
[16:12] intentional about the money that you are
[16:14] spending and making sure that you're
[16:16] living somewhat frugally and not wasting
[16:19] money on stupid stuff that doesn't
[16:20] actually add value to your life. Um and
[16:22] then taking whatever excess savings that
[16:24] you have and investing that uh as
[16:27] quickly as possible, as much as
[16:29] possible. And primarily the vehicle that
[16:32] is used by the the FIRE community
[16:35] traditionally is the stock market index,
[16:38] the total stock market index. You're not
[16:40] necessarily picking stocks and trying to
[16:42] pick winners and losers. You're just
[16:44] buying all of the companies uh that are
[16:47] based in the US. And the US market is a
[16:50] very important aspect of this because
[16:52] the US has historically outperformed the
[16:55] international stock markets because the
[16:57] US has the tailwinds of being the global
[16:59] leader from an economic perspective and
[17:03] really came off of the um
[17:06] industrialization that happened uh going
[17:10] into the the you know 1900 and and
[17:13] through the first world war um that was
[17:16] kind of built off of the gold standard.
[17:18] uh in my mind, right, it's that you have
[17:20] these incentives in place that
[17:23] encourages savings. Uh you have free
[17:25] markets and that led to this massive
[17:29] increase in capital uh and a a spirit of
[17:33] entrepreneurship and uh inventiveness
[17:36] that created the world that we're still
[17:38] enjoying today, right? like all the
[17:40] seeds of the big inventions and and the
[17:43] massive amount of progress that has been
[17:45] made over the last 150 years were uh
[17:49] those seeds were were planted in the
[17:52] late 1800s when we were kind of on the
[17:55] classical gold standard um and this uh
[17:59] incentive structure of saving and
[18:00] investment and capital uh accumulation
[18:03] was was really taking hold. We've gone
[18:06] away from that. Um, but a lot of the
[18:10] momentum that was created from those
[18:12] seeds being planted are still being
[18:15] sewn, right? Like it's we're still
[18:17] benefiting from the fact that we uh
[18:19] created this environment where the US
[18:21] would be the global leader and the
[18:24] financial system has morphed in a lot of
[18:28] different ways. We're no longer on a
[18:29] gold standard. That ended in 1971 when
[18:31] Nixon closed the gold window. Um and
[18:34] since then we've been in a credit based
[18:36] economy where you're continually needing
[18:39] to um expand the uh amount of credit
[18:44] that is in the economy and that credit
[18:46] acts as money at this point in time. US
[18:48] treasuries sit at the foundation of the
[18:50] financial system and credit like bank
[18:53] deposits act as the payment mechanism
[18:56] that we all use and that's what drives
[18:58] prices is this increase in in credit
[19:01] that has to happen because this is all
[19:03] debt based and if you don't increase the
[19:05] credit then you end up with this
[19:07] downward pressure of deflation as the
[19:11] debts come due but there's no new money
[19:13] to actually service both the debt and
[19:16] the interest that is is um you know
[19:18] attached to that to that debt. What that
[19:21] means is that the FIRE community has
[19:24] tapped into kind of a truism of the way
[19:28] that the financial system works and the
[19:30] way that the markets work, which is that
[19:32] the stock market is always going to go
[19:34] up. And it's always going to go up
[19:36] because you've got um you know
[19:39] productive companies that are
[19:41] accumulating capital, but they're also
[19:44] benefiting from this tailwind. And in
[19:46] reality, they're mostly benefiting from
[19:48] this tailwind of an increase in the
[19:50] money supply that M2 that that bank
[19:53] deposit uh money that is out there that
[19:56] is feeding into their bottom lines and
[19:59] causing the valuations to grow in dollar
[20:02] terms regardless of the fact that they
[20:04] may not be profitable. They may be
[20:07] fueling a lot of that growth on debt uh
[20:09] and this expansion of credit that's
[20:11] happening. So bringing it back around,
[20:14] you have a stock market index that you
[20:18] can buy which gives you exposure to the
[20:20] entire US stock market. And historically
[20:23] speaking, it's risen at a value of
[20:26] anywhere from call it 8 to 10% nominally
[20:29] per year over the last o over 100 years.
[20:32] And that just so happens to kind of ek
[20:34] out a little bit of a real return
[20:37] relative to the expansion of the money
[20:39] supply which is somewhere in the
[20:40] neighborhood of 7% per year. And so if
[20:44] you are aggressively saving, if you are
[20:46] plowing the savings into the stock
[20:49] market index, you are enjoying an
[20:52] increase in wealth uh relative to your
[20:56] costs that are also increasing, but
[20:58] you're kind of outpacing it uh in in
[21:00] very uh slim margins. And that allows
[21:03] you to become wealthy and to get to a
[21:05] point where you no longer have to work
[21:07] because you can start to live off of the
[21:09] returns that you're generating in your
[21:11] portfolio. So the approach that the fire
[21:13] people take is uh intentional
[21:16] spending. Live like somewhat frugally
[21:19] and take any excess savings that you
[21:21] have and plow it into the stock market
[21:23] index and build up a portfolio that is
[21:27] large enough to support the expenses
[21:29] that you have on an annual basis. And
[21:32] based off of the historic returns that
[21:36] the US stock market has generated, um
[21:39] you can do that with about uh a
[21:42] portfolio that's about the size of 25
[21:44] times your annual expenses. And uh the
[21:47] inverse of that is called the 4% rule.
[21:50] Uh in other words, you could live off of
[21:52] 4% of the value of your portfolio on an
[21:56] annual basis by selling down that
[21:58] portfolio. And at the end of a 30-year
[22:01] period, you actually are more likely
[22:04] than not to end up with a larger nominal
[22:06] portfolio value than what you started
[22:08] with. So, you can reach this early
[22:11] retirement, live off your portfolio, and
[22:14] go do whatever you want to do, right?
[22:15] You can quit your job, you can go work
[22:16] on a passion project, you can travel the
[22:18] world. It's totally up to you. But the
[22:20] important point is that you've reached
[22:21] financial independence. You're no longer
[22:24] tied to a particular paycheck and you
[22:26] can live off this nest egg that you've
[22:28] built in the form of a savings
[22:30] portfolio. Super interesting. It except
[22:33] that the the fire community is still
[22:37] very feared
[22:39] uh just from the from the the
[22:43] fundamentals or from the principles that
[22:45] they teach. It's very bitcoiny. uh for
[22:48] lack of a better word, Bitcoiny, but
[22:50] like it the like live within your means,
[22:53] be frugal, uh stack consistently, uh if
[22:56] you have stacked enough, you can live
[22:58] your life and you can uh take a small
[23:00] portion of your stack and and live from
[23:02] that and be independent and use your
[23:04] Bitcoin. So those are all concepts and
[23:06] principles that are really popular
[23:08] actually in Bitcoin. Now the interesting
[23:11] question
[23:12] is how does the
[23:15] fire change when you mix in Bitcoin?
[23:20] Yeah. So you're you're hitting on
[23:22] exactly right there. there's this
[23:24] overlap in the approach that the fire
[23:27] community has that Bitcoiners kind of
[23:28] naturally have because they're starting
[23:31] to denominate their lifestyle or they're
[23:35] starting to use Bitcoin as their unit of
[23:37] account and recognizing the opport the
[23:40] opportunity cost that you have for every
[23:42] dollar that you're spending that you're
[23:43] not saving in Bitcoin, which is growing
[23:45] at a much faster rate than the stock
[23:47] market is. Um so it it my uh my
[23:52] newsletter is called Fire BTC. Um every
[23:55] week I write about how um Bitcoin
[23:59] Bitcoiners can achieve financial
[24:00] independence and how uh FIRE
[24:03] practitioners can incorporate Bitcoin
[24:05] into their plan. And it was based off of
[24:07] this uh post that I published back in I
[24:11] think it was March of 2023 called
[24:14] Bitcoin is fire friendly. And uh Bitcoin
[24:17] is fire friendly was really built around
[24:20] the dynamic that you're talking about
[24:22] which is that fire practitioners
[24:24] actually um they intuitively understand
[24:27] a few core truths. One is that the
[24:31] financial system is not really what it
[24:33] seems that it's actually built on credit
[24:35] and not based on money. Um that life
[24:38] continually gets more expensive and then
[24:41] in order to combat that you need to
[24:43] invest. you can't just save money,
[24:45] right? So, these are all things that the
[24:48] fire community intuitively understands
[24:50] and they choose to use the stock market
[24:52] index as their preferred vehicle for
[24:55] outpacing that increase in in living uh
[24:58] cost and then achieving financial
[25:01] independence uh earlier in life than you
[25:04] know the the traditional retirement age
[25:07] of 65. When you incorporate Bitcoin into
[25:11] your FIRE plan, you now have a path for
[25:14] accelerating that uh that early
[25:17] retirement or achieving financial
[25:19] independence in a much uh you're you're
[25:24] accelerating it to you know a point
[25:27] where you can actually reach that
[25:28] financial independence much earlier in
[25:30] in your life because Bitcoin is growing
[25:33] at a much faster rate. But it requires
[25:36] that you actually understand what
[25:38] Bitcoin is and what the utility is. And
[25:40] it requires that you understand how to
[25:42] deal with volatility in all of this.
[25:44] What Bitcoiners do is recognize that
[25:47] Bitcoin is the apex predator of of store
[25:51] of value assets and that by
[25:53] incorporating it into a fire plan does
[25:56] uh give you this path for accelerating
[25:58] um financial independence. So, if you
[26:02] can recognize this and if you can find
[26:04] the proper balance of having a stock
[26:07] portfolio and a little bit of Bitcoin,
[26:09] at least as you're getting started, um
[26:11] you can actually start to uh you know
[26:14] get to that financial independence and
[26:16] that early retirement in a much quicker
[26:18] way. It also if you kind of the more you
[26:22] allocate the because of of the coin's
[26:25] historic growth uh rate and because it
[26:28] it might continue to grow at that faster
[26:31] rate. It actually allows for you to live
[26:34] off of maybe a smaller starting value.
[26:37] This is kind of the other side of um
[26:40] accelerating this this financial
[26:42] independence journey is that you
[26:43] actually could save up a little bit less
[26:45] before you can reach that goal. um as
[26:47] opposed to uh you know saving up the
[26:50] same amount as what you would be
[26:51] targeting for a a stock portfolio but
[26:55] then just having that grow to an
[26:57] extraordinary amount of money by the
[26:59] time that you were to pass it on to to
[27:01] your family members.
[27:03] That's super interesting. also also that
[27:05] 4% rule um just so that I got it right
[27:09] 4% means uh your you can use 4% of your
[27:16] uh complete stack and basically uh lift
[27:19] off that from an annual annual expense.
[27:22] So the fire target in that case would be
[27:26] uh you need take your annual expense.
[27:28] Let's say it's 40,000 a year. Uh then
[27:32] you would need $1 million in in in in
[27:36] the stack to actually be able to it's a
[27:39] it's an interesting rule because it's
[27:41] also kind of conservative that and uh I
[27:44] don't know if you've mentioned but I've
[27:46] heard that you said like you can pump
[27:48] the the number of 4% to 8% when you use
[27:51] Bitcoin. that comes from you, right?
[27:53] That Yeah. So, um in a recent, uh issue
[27:57] of the newsletter, I explored in more of
[28:00] a qualitative way as opposed to a
[28:01] quantitative way uh as to like what does
[28:04] it mean for Bitcoin's growth rate to be
[28:07] so much higher than stocks if you're
[28:09] incorporating that as a large percentage
[28:11] of your portfolio. And um just being
[28:13] very conservative, you know, Bitcoin has
[28:16] historically grown at 50 to 60% per
[28:19] year. It remains to be seen as to how
[28:22] quickly it will grow going forward and
[28:25] what that uh curve is going to look
[28:27] like. But if we're very conservative and
[28:29] just say instead of Bitcoin growing at
[28:32] 7% like it does in the stock market, it
[28:35] grows double 7%. Well, that does imply
[28:39] that you could actually withdraw double
[28:41] the amount uh for the same portfolio
[28:44] value. Uh so instead of having 4% rule,
[28:48] you could actually have an 8% rule. Now
[28:51] the the biggest risk to this is
[28:54] Bitcoin's volatility. So there's
[28:56] something called sequence of withdrawals
[28:58] risk. And if we put Bitcoin aside and we
[29:02] just think about the stock market, if
[29:04] you were to reach your financial
[29:05] independence number in September of 2007
[29:10] and then by April of 2008, you have uh
[29:14] you have retired and you're starting to
[29:17] draw down 4% on your portfolio, the
[29:19] stock market got cut in half over that
[29:21] next year, right? What that means is
[29:24] that you are now withdrawing
[29:27] uh a you know 4% of your original
[29:31] valuation which let's call it you know a
[29:33] million for each $40,000 that you are
[29:36] are spending. Well if that million very
[29:39] quickly drops to being a portfolio only
[29:41] worth $500,000. all of a sudden you your
[29:45] early retirement is in jeopardy because
[29:47] you're selling down these assets at much
[29:50] lower valuation and thereby um you're
[29:53] actually living on maybe an 8%
[29:55] withdrawal rate. Well, it might take a
[29:58] long time for the stock market to
[30:01] recover and get you back to your
[30:02] original valuation. And when you look at
[30:05] the historic data, that sequence of
[30:07] withdrawal risk is really the one big
[30:11] issue with uh retiring early and living
[30:15] off the 4% rule. If you are starting
[30:18] exactly uh along those guidelines. And
[30:21] so if you can get past the first couple
[30:23] of years without that big draw down, uh
[30:26] you there's pretty much no instances in
[30:29] the historical record where you would
[30:31] run out of money after a 30-year period.
[30:34] Uh but there is that risk of the first
[30:36] call it year or two where if the market
[30:39] draws down drastically and you've
[30:41] already retired and you're drawing down
[30:43] on a larger portion of the portfolio
[30:45] than you were expecting, it can put that
[30:46] retirement at risk. Bitcoin has the same
[30:49] problem or the same issue or the same
[30:51] risk available to it. It's just that the
[30:54] volatility is at a much larger uh
[30:57] amplitude there. And so you still need
[31:00] even if you are uh withdrawing at an 8%
[31:03] rate, you still need to take that into
[31:05] account and have a plan for if the
[31:08] Bitcoin price withdraws uh by 80% in the
[31:12] next year that after you've retired that
[31:14] you have some way of maybe supplementing
[31:15] your income uh or reducing your expenses
[31:19] so that you can weather those first uh
[31:21] year or two. The reality of the
[31:23] situation is that most people's this is
[31:26] all very plannable. Like you can plan
[31:28] for this type of volatility. You can put
[31:30] um some plans in place that allows you
[31:33] to be flexible on the income that you're
[31:35] producing that can supplement these
[31:37] types of years. Um or plan to go live in
[31:40] a country that has a much lower uh cost
[31:42] of living for a year while you weather
[31:44] the storm. it's a kind of a perfect
[31:46] perfect opportunity to to see the world
[31:48] and accomplish this other goal of making
[31:50] sure that your retirement can last. Um,
[31:52] but if you're just going strictly with
[31:54] the 4% rule or the 8% rule when it comes
[31:57] to Bitcoin, uh, you do need to be
[32:00] cognizant of this risk, which is that if
[32:03] the price draws down very drastically in
[32:06] the first year or two of your
[32:07] retirement, it might be put at risk. You
[32:09] just got to have a contingency plan in
[32:11] place. Let's take a break for a moment
[32:13] and appreciate the beauty that Coin
[32:15] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[32:18] watches. Those watches are the most
[32:21] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[32:23] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner
[32:26] and Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[32:29] completely new and amazing Genesis
[32:31] edition of their watch collections. You
[32:34] have the date of the first ever mined
[32:37] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[32:40] also the block height and which epoch we
[32:43] are currently in. I love the level of
[32:46] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[32:49] Make sure to check out those amazing
[32:51] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[32:54] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[32:57] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[33:00] really do hope that you don't have it on
[33:02] exchange. But if you do have it on
[33:04] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[33:05] deal with that. The first way is you put
[33:08] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[33:10] entry for you to get into the
[33:12] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[33:16] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[33:18] super simple and secure way. And if you
[33:21] check out the link in the description,
[33:23] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[33:26] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[33:29] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[33:32] partner in terms of how to get the most
[33:35] out of your sovereignty. They will
[33:38] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[33:41] that is perfect for your individual
[33:44] situation. They will show you how you
[33:46] can secure your own devices. Securing
[33:49] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[33:51] have to keep all your devices secure.
[33:53] One topic that is overlooked often is
[33:55] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[33:58] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[34:01] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[34:04] place already? And last but not least,
[34:06] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[34:08] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[34:10] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[34:15] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[34:18] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[34:21] be for the first time ever speaking at
[34:23] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[34:26] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[34:29] really looking forward to seeing all of
[34:31] you there. You can get your ticket in
[34:33] the link down in the description of
[34:35] Bitcoin Prague and very important use
[34:38] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[34:41] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[34:43] there. There's also one aspect that I
[34:45] always like to to bring up. Um I
[34:48] couldn't sit around and do nothing even
[34:50] if I had financial independence and I
[34:52] don't. If I had
[34:55] that, I would still do probably what I
[34:58] currently do with the podcast because
[35:00] it's just so fun. Uh maybe I would do it
[35:03] less professional and don't care about
[35:06] thumbnails. Yeah, mo most people are
[35:08] like that, right? They've got some type
[35:10] of passion that they would like to
[35:11] pursue if it weren't for this pesky job
[35:14] that takes up, you know, 8 to 10 hours
[35:16] of their day, right? And so, uh, and
[35:18] especially today, there are so many
[35:20] different ways that you can bring in an
[35:23] income, uh, that doesn't require you to
[35:26] be going into an office and sitting in a
[35:28] cubicle and working like a traditional
[35:31] job um to to uh, you know, cover at
[35:35] least some portion of the expenses that
[35:37] you've got. And in doing so, it makes
[35:40] the portfolio that you've got that is
[35:43] covering the rest of your expenses that
[35:45] much more conservative. Uh so there's a
[35:47] lot of different flexibility uh that you
[35:49] can put into your particular plan. And
[35:51] ultimately it is a personal decision as
[35:53] to how you approach this. That that's
[35:56] the way that I talk about this, right?
[35:57] Is that you know there's some guidelines
[35:58] that we can put in place, the 4% rule or
[36:00] the 8% rule if you're incorporating
[36:02] Bitcoin. Um, but ultimately you've got
[36:06] to figure out what works best for you
[36:08] and um based off of the the
[36:10] opportunities that you've got and the
[36:12] expenses that you want to to have and
[36:15] and the the retirement that you want to
[36:17] create for yourself is all going to
[36:20] affect how you think about the amount
[36:22] that you need to save and what your
[36:24] asset allocation is going to be and and
[36:26] how you're going to manage all those
[36:27] different aspects. So, the rule
[36:29] basically would be
[36:31] um do you have enough Bitcoin to support
[36:36] one year of uh expenses with 8% of your
[36:40] stack? And are we currently in a bare
[36:43] market? So, if you're currently in a
[36:45] bare market, you can still do it. It it
[36:47] it might actually uh work out if you're
[36:50] currently at a bull market. Let's say we
[36:52] rally uh end of the year to
[36:54] 250,000. Um and then you reach that
[36:57] point, it might be a risky point because
[36:59] maybe we crash down to 120 crash down to
[37:03] 120K again and all of a sudden your
[37:05] calculations are are not working
[37:07] anymore. Yeah, there's there's a number
[37:08] of different ways that you can kind of
[37:10] adjust the math to make it more
[37:12] conservative, right? You could think of
[37:14] it in terms of, okay, instead of an 8%
[37:17] uh withdrawal rate, I'm going to just
[37:19] target a 6% withdrawal rate, which means
[37:21] that I've got to save up a little bit
[37:22] more or the the price of Bitcoin has to
[37:24] go up a little bit more before I can
[37:26] retire. But that's going to make it more
[37:28] conservative, which allows you to not be
[37:31] as exposed to that first year or two of
[37:34] a price draw down if that were to occur.
[37:36] Um, you could also think about valuing
[37:39] the Bitcoin that you own at something
[37:42] other than the market price. Um, so if
[37:44] you look at the 200E moving average,
[37:47] it's sitting somewhere in the
[37:48] neighborhood of like 44,000 or 45,000
[37:51] right now. So if you ignore the current
[37:53] market price and say, okay, I've got
[37:55] this Bitcoin stack over here and I'm
[37:58] just going to instead of applying a
[38:00] market valuation to it, I'm going to
[38:01] apply a 200W week moving average
[38:04] valuation to it. Well, now all of a
[38:06] sudden you've got probably a lot further
[38:09] to go in order to actually reach that
[38:11] fire number, but you're massively
[38:14] reducing the the chances that you're
[38:16] going to end up in a a more risky
[38:18] situation when it comes to this sequence
[38:20] of withdrawals that you're having to
[38:22] deal with. Um, so, you know, I tend to
[38:25] approach things in a very conservative
[38:28] way. Um, I still use the 4% rule as my
[38:32] guideline for my personal uh Bitcoin
[38:35] stack and mix of some stocks that I have
[38:37] left over from from a previous life,
[38:38] right? Um, and to me that makes a lot of
[38:41] sense because um, you know, I kind of am
[38:45] already at that number. So why draw more
[38:48] than I need to? Uh, I'm probably going
[38:50] to be selling down any stock that I that
[38:53] I own before I'm even touching the
[38:54] Bitcoin. So, I'm in a very conservative
[38:57] position relative to all of this. Uh,
[38:58] but if you're just now starting out and
[39:00] you're trying to figure out, okay,
[39:02] what's the target that I need to get to?
[39:03] How quickly do I need to be saving? Um,
[39:06] you can take some of these other
[39:07] dynamics into account. That's where I
[39:09] think is most of the value. You want to
[39:12] have a savings goal and you want to have
[39:15] a plan in place what you do with your
[39:18] finances
[39:19] because you want to a um have financial
[39:23] stability and security, but you also
[39:25] want to be not die with the most bitcoin
[39:30] you ever had. So, so I mean if you want
[39:34] to pass it down to your kids and and
[39:35] have generational wealth that or or just
[39:38] give it to charity, that that's
[39:40] something really cool and and that's
[39:42] something really charable to do. I
[39:44] respect that. But if you say, okay, I
[39:46] worked hard and I also want to have
[39:48] something from the fruits of my labor.
[39:50] Um maybe it's a good way of saying, hey,
[39:53] now I have that stack. Just mapping out
[39:57] how many years I have left to live.
[39:59] Maybe I'm 50. uh just calculating, oh, I
[40:02] have about 40, 50, 30 years to go. Um
[40:07] maybe it's actually a good idea to get
[40:10] some of my Bitcoin stack and start
[40:13] living my life and or like you probably
[40:15] already lived, but start enjoying things
[40:17] that you wouldn't have enjoyed before.
[40:20] Uh if that makes sense. Uh or maybe take
[40:22] some uh less work, whatever you want to
[40:25] do with that. There's like no limits to
[40:27] that. But it's an interesting um anchor
[40:30] point that maybe makes it easier to
[40:33] manage personal finance, I guess. Yeah.
[40:36] Well, it's it's very encouraging when
[40:38] you start this process and you're you're
[40:41] calculating what your number is and then
[40:43] you're mapping where you're at and what
[40:45] your status is or your progress relative
[40:47] to that number. Um you know, after you
[40:49] start doing this for a six-month period
[40:52] or a year or two years, you start seeing
[40:54] that number trend toward your goal. uh
[40:56] and it's it's pretty uh you know pretty
[40:59] encouraging and and allows you to kind
[41:01] of lean into it more and and say hey
[41:03] this is actually working like this plan
[41:05] uh is is actually working for me and and
[41:09] now I can start to see okay it's going
[41:11] to take me 5 years to reach this goal.
[41:13] Um now you've got like an end in sight
[41:15] and you can start planning for what the
[41:17] next phase of your life is going to look
[41:19] like. Um, you know, some people love
[41:22] their job and they don't plan on ever
[41:24] leaving it. And but having that
[41:27] financial independence puts you in a
[41:29] position where you don't have to worry
[41:30] about whether or not this company that
[41:32] you work for or this job is actually
[41:34] there. If you were to lose it, you're
[41:36] totally fine, right? You can you can
[41:38] cover your expenses. Um, and then to
[41:40] your point, you know, life is short. You
[41:43] never know when the the current day is
[41:45] going to be your last. Um, and you
[41:47] should find this balance of being able
[41:49] to enjoy the fruits of your labor to be
[41:51] able to like experience life and go
[41:54] travel if that's your thing or go play a
[41:56] lot of golf if that's your thing or
[41:57] whatever the case may be. Um, we
[42:00] shouldn't be necessarily just living to
[42:02] work, right? We should be working to
[42:04] live. And I think that's like the core
[42:07] uh ethos that the fire community brings
[42:09] with it is this uh kind of newfound
[42:12] optimism for saying, "Hey, there's a
[42:14] path for you to work hard, be
[42:18] intentional, save a whole bunch of
[42:20] money, and then put yourself and your
[42:22] family in a position to really enjoy
[42:24] life as opposed to just being stuck in a
[42:27] cubicle all day."
[42:29] What have you learned from the fire
[42:32] community that you miss in the Bitcoin
[42:34] community? Um, I don't know that there's
[42:37] much there to be perfectly honest,
[42:38] right? Like I I love that. So I mean we
[42:41] talked about it a little bit before that
[42:43] the Bitcoin community kind of
[42:46] naturally is inclined to save more and
[42:50] to find ways to stack more SATs because
[42:53] they very explicitly understand the
[42:57] opportunity cost that comes with not
[43:00] owning Bitcoin. The FIRE community is it
[43:03] there's still a lot of resistance to
[43:05] Bitcoin for whatever reason. And I think
[43:07] it's just, you know, kind of a follow
[43:08] the leader type of thing where these
[43:10] influencers have um poisoned the well to
[43:13] some degree and not had an open mind and
[43:16] they are um you know just kind of
[43:20] appealing to authority in in that
[43:22] regard, right? Like Mr. Money Mustache,
[43:24] I mentioned him before, the the very
[43:26] first issue of my newsletter started off
[43:28] with uh quoting a blog post that he had
[43:31] back in 2018 called uh why Bitcoin is
[43:34] stupid, right? And I I don't think he's
[43:37] changed his tone on that. I don't see
[43:38] any reason that he would. You know,
[43:39] there's a a lot on the line for kind of
[43:42] flip-flopping on on an important issue
[43:44] like that that's garnered so much
[43:45] attention. But, um, you know, I I think
[43:49] the the Bitcoin community has a really
[43:52] great ethos of making sure that their
[43:56] own personal incentive structure is
[43:58] mapping to the reality of what Bitcoin
[44:00] provides to the world. And what I hope
[44:03] to help them understand is that hey, you
[44:05] can actually think about this framework
[44:07] that comes from a a more traditional
[44:10] approach to finances, bring that into
[44:12] the way that you approach your personal
[44:14] finances and actually have a plan that
[44:16] you can work toward to reach a goal that
[44:20] um gives you some structure around, hey,
[44:22] when can I actually retire? Which is a a
[44:25] a pretty interesting question that a lot
[44:27] of people bring up in the Bitcoin world.
[44:29] I think they just don't have necessarily
[44:31] like a an actual framework with which to
[44:34] think through that question and realize
[44:36] what is enough. How much do I need to
[44:38] stack to actually reach that goal? And
[44:41] it's for for me I see when I see the
[44:44] fire community and I'm not deep in there
[44:46] but I have seen a lot of posts around
[44:49] that I see some similarities actually
[44:51] with with the Bitcoin communities when
[44:53] it comes
[44:55] to how we should do the financial
[44:57] behaviors like DCAing the the concept
[45:00] that I teach uh I like those concepts
[45:03] and principles a lot uh and it uh it
[45:07] it's interesting why they are so heavily
[45:09] on fear
[45:10] as you said with with the leaders and
[45:12] and and influencers can bring a big
[45:16] burden on on on a community and I really
[45:19] like that about Bitcoin where uh the
[45:21] slay your heroes uh and and this first
[45:24] principal thinking and this critical
[45:26] think is really in their in the
[45:27] community uh and it's not like oh sailor
[45:30] says that now the whole community is
[45:32] going there or like someone says that
[45:34] and then the whole community is there so
[45:36] I think that's maybe something the fire
[45:38] community can learn from Bitcoin.
[45:40] uh slay your own heroes and and think
[45:42] for yourself critically. Um but I see in
[45:45] many ways Bitcoin and the Bitcoin
[45:47] community as a new fire community like a
[45:52] I don't know fire 2.0 0 or whatever you
[45:54] want to call it because a lot of people
[45:58] that listen to Bitcoin podcasts and
[46:01] implement the Bitcoin philosophy of
[46:04] living below your means DCAing they will
[46:07] be not only retire on Bitcoin will
[46:10] probably be really wealthy because of
[46:12] Bitcoin. Uh and this is a community that
[46:15] holds together and then actually
[46:17] benefits the ones that are in there. So,
[46:20] uh I I I I do like your approach of like
[46:23] connecting uh those communities uh and
[46:25] and maybe showing the fire community
[46:28] that there is like a fire 2.0 that they
[46:30] they might want to join. Yeah, I've seen
[46:32] some signs of life over there. Um, you
[46:35] know, I I've pulled back from being in
[46:37] the weeds with fire community to to some
[46:39] degree just because, you know, they they
[46:42] don't there there's not much that
[46:44] they're going to contribute to my
[46:47] pursuit of stacking as as much SATs as I
[46:51] can in order to reach the goals that I
[46:53] have for myself and my family, right?
[46:54] Um, but I I I think you know number go
[46:59] up technology is the key thing that
[47:02] brings everybody to Bitcoin. There's a
[47:04] certain point, I think we're at that
[47:06] inflection point now, where you just
[47:08] can't really ignore it, right? If
[47:10] Bitcoin goes from where it is now today,
[47:13] to
[47:14] $250,000, like the FIRE community and
[47:17] those people who have ignored it and
[47:19] followed those influencers and followed
[47:21] Vanguard and the bogoheads as saying,
[47:23] "Oh, no, we're not even going to support
[47:25] a Bitcoin option within our within our
[47:27] company." if if as and when that
[47:31] happens, you just can't ignore that you
[47:34] missed the boat on on this particular
[47:36] thing, right? And so that
[47:38] open-mindedness to actually explore
[47:40] something that has been around for quite
[47:43] a while, you know, in 15 years, we've
[47:45] gone from the government will ban it to
[47:48] the government will buy it. And uh I
[47:50] think when that starts when that
[47:52] continues to happen or that trend
[47:53] continues to happen, you you have to
[47:55] take notice and you've got to uh start
[47:57] making at least some type of allocation.
[47:59] There's there's really no excuse for
[48:01] these people to have a 0% allocation to
[48:03] Bitcoin. What whatever you are going to
[48:06] feel comfortable with from an allocation
[48:07] perspective um that that's that's a
[48:10] personal basis. It definitely is going
[48:12] to uh you know be volatile and something
[48:14] that you have to wrap your head around.
[48:16] Um, but that volatility can be managed
[48:19] with proper sizing. Uh, but the proper
[48:22] sizing is definitely not 0% at this
[48:24] point.
[48:26] It's it's uh it it bothers me when
[48:29] people still have zero Bitcoin and it's
[48:33] 99% or like 98% or 99 97% of of people.
[48:39] most people uh but the ignorance uh
[48:43] against that is is really mindblowing
[48:46] for me. I get why people might be
[48:49] fearful of going all in like like I
[48:52] did but having some form of exposure is
[48:58] almost irresponsible at that point if
[49:00] you don't have any Bitcoin like any
[49:03] Satoshi is in in you have you can now
[49:06] buy it in ETF you can now buy you can
[49:08] even buy if you're um uh saying oh let's
[49:12] buy some strategy it's okay you have
[49:14] some some sort of Bitcoin exposure
[49:16] trade. I I know it's not perfect, but at
[49:19] least you get some something of Bitcoin
[49:22] in your life. And I guess if you have S
[49:24] SP 500, there's Tesla in there, you also
[49:27] have some sort of Bitcoin exposure, but
[49:30] it's not good enough. So, you need some
[49:31] direct exposure throats, right? Like the
[49:35] um you know, people who own VTI, the
[49:37] Vanguard total market index, they
[49:39] already own Micro Strategy or Strategy
[49:42] uh because that's included in that
[49:44] index. is now included in the NASDAQ as
[49:46] well and at some point it'll be included
[49:48] in the S&P 500 and so all of the uh you
[49:52] know FIRE community that is just buying
[49:54] these index they are getting some
[49:56] indirect exposure and it's only going to
[49:58] continue to grow as more and more of
[50:02] these public companies these large
[50:04] companies develop a Bitcoin strategy
[50:06] whether that's for their treasury or
[50:08] incorporating it as part of their
[50:10] business uh and and the like. So, you
[50:12] know, you you kind of can choose to
[50:15] ignore it in a proactive manner, but the
[50:18] strategy that you've chosen is going to
[50:20] get you that exposure anyway. Um, so,
[50:23] you know, may maybe uh maybe that's a
[50:27] good way to approach it is like, hey,
[50:28] I'll just let the market come to me
[50:29] instead of me going to the market.
[50:31] You're going to underperform, but you
[50:33] know, maybe that's maybe that's okay.
[50:35] Has uh Bitcoin changed uh your financial
[50:39] behaviors? Well, when I started on my
[50:42] FIRE journey, I like took it very very
[50:45] seriously. So, I incorporated this like
[50:47] frugalness uh a little bit too much of
[50:51] an extreme where I was, you know, really
[50:54] like counting dollars and funneling as
[50:57] much as I could into those index funds.
[51:00] when I really started to understand
[51:01] Bitcoin, I I started shifting that uh
[51:04] that savings portfolio or the the new
[51:07] allocations toward Bitcoin and buying
[51:09] that much more aggressively. Um really
[51:12] the way that it's helped me is to say,
[51:15] okay, I've got this core position now,
[51:20] which is Bitcoin. That's basically the
[51:22] only thing that I add to. Um, I still
[51:25] have some of these stocks that are out
[51:27] there that uh allow me to have kind of a
[51:30] contingency plan in that uh sequence of
[51:33] withdrawal situation if I decide that I
[51:36] want to retire and stop working and have
[51:38] zero income. Um, but you
[51:41] know, it really hasn't changed my plan
[51:44] other than accelerating how quickly I'm
[51:46] able to actually reach financial
[51:49] independence, which I'm basically kind
[51:51] of already there. Um, and so now I can
[51:53] start thinking about what that that
[51:55] postfire life looks like. Um, and
[51:59] shifting my priorities and the way that
[52:00] I spend my time over the next few years
[52:03] toward those things that that I want to
[52:04] pursue.
[52:06] It's an interesting question. And what
[52:08] would you do if there is no money
[52:11] problem whatsoever and you can just
[52:13] stand up and and and do is there
[52:15] actually I talked with that um Noah Kman
[52:19] I think is his name that I talked to and
[52:23] he has a theory that we are now in a
[52:25] fiat world and we will be in a full
[52:27] Bitcoin world and he thinks Bitcoin will
[52:30] bring so much abundance that we will at
[52:33] some point come to a no money world um
[52:37] because we all taken care of and we
[52:40] might be just able to live and do
[52:43] whatever we want and not have to
[52:47] struggle with money. However, this looks
[52:48] like maybe there's still a ranking
[52:50] system and money system. Maybe there is
[52:53] nothing of that at all. Um do you think
[52:56] that Bitcoin could bring us so far into
[53:00] the future? And and I want to preface a
[53:03] little bit more. Um, one thing is also
[53:06] for certain, if you look now at the
[53:09] average fewer here, the average person
[53:12] in in in life, they are a lot richer
[53:16] than the richest guy alive like 100, 200
[53:20] years ago. Uh, they couldn't went into a
[53:23] plane and just drove floor flying across
[53:26] the Atlantics. They couldn't phone uh
[53:28] their their their families home. uh and
[53:31] a lot of things that we all can do now
[53:34] wasn't accessible for anyone just a few
[53:36] hundred years ago. So in a lot of ways
[53:39] we already are really abundant. Uh if
[53:43] you look in the general population
[53:44] there's a lot of poorness in in the
[53:46] world. Um but do you think Bitcoin will
[53:49] bring us to to an abundant uh world at
[53:52] some point? I think it can if it is
[53:56] adopted in the way that we expect that
[53:58] it will be. I think that you can go from
[54:02] if you remove credit based money and the
[54:05] drag that it has on the uh the incentive
[54:10] structure for uh production, you're
[54:13] going to get a more productive society
[54:16] with less waste. And maybe in real
[54:19] terms, we're growing at 10% as opposed
[54:22] to 3% on an annual basis throughout the
[54:26] world. even an increase from 3% to 4% if
[54:30] that were the case would have just
[54:32] drastic implications for the living
[54:35] standards uh and the number of people
[54:37] who are living in poverty around the
[54:39] world. So I definitely think that the in
[54:41] the incentive structure that Bitcoin
[54:44] brings if adopted in the in more of a
[54:47] grand scale can accelerate the progress
[54:50] that we're making. Um, I I am less of a
[54:53] doomer when it comes to, you know, what
[54:55] the current fiat financial system has
[54:58] brought to us. Like there certainly are
[55:00] a lot of issues in the world. We're all
[55:03] very aware of them. But you're you're
[55:04] absolutely right that like even looking
[55:06] back 50 years ago, I mean, people could
[55:08] not imagine the uh living standards that
[55:11] we have today and the different ways
[55:13] that we're able to communicate like you
[55:15] and I talking over video halfway across
[55:17] the world from one another um in in
[55:20] order to communicate to, you know, the
[55:22] the entire rest of the world or anybody
[55:24] who wants to tune in to to what we have
[55:26] to say, right? Um and we are making huge
[55:30] strides in the way of AI. I think that's
[55:33] going to continue. We'll see what limits
[55:35] uh are going to be reached based off of
[55:37] really the hardware limitations and the
[55:39] energy limitations that we've got in the
[55:41] physical world. Um but you know that
[55:44] that development is going to continue uh
[55:46] a pace and then you know in terms of um
[55:51] in in terms of the idea of moving beyond
[55:54] money that's not something that I
[55:56] believe money is an essential part of
[56:00] allocating resources. uh we have
[56:02] imperfect money that we're using today
[56:04] which creates uh again this drag on the
[56:07] ability to allocate capital uh in the
[56:10] most productive manner but you always
[56:12] need as long as there is physical world
[56:16] there will be physical scarcity and you
[56:19] need these physical items in order to
[56:23] generate physical things that allows us
[56:26] to sustain our bodies in the real world.
[56:29] um you know that requires an allocation
[56:33] of resources. It requires market signals
[56:36] and the best tool that we have for being
[56:38] able to do that is using money. Uh even
[56:42] in like this post AI general
[56:44] intelligence type world that people are
[56:46] talking about um you still need to have
[56:50] the ability for these machines to
[56:52] allocate the resources to themselves
[56:54] versus somewhere else uh in order to to
[56:57] create production. So, u will we re uh
[57:00] reach some type of like post money
[57:02] world? I don't think that's uh possible
[57:04] or desirable. Um but I think that's
[57:07] generally like it's directionally
[57:10] correct in that we will get to a place
[57:12] where we're just so much more
[57:14] productive. Uh and we'll continue to be
[57:16] able to move in the direction of working
[57:18] less if we would like to. Um, and and
[57:21] Bitcoin allows you to get to that place
[57:23] much much sooner as long as you embrace
[57:25] the incentives that are that are kind of
[57:27] inherent with having a fixed money
[57:29] supply. I really think that Bitcoin is
[57:32] that that the fiat world, the fiat
[57:34] monetary system was a necessary bridge
[57:37] from the sound money of the past to the
[57:39] sound money of the future. Uh it's like
[57:42] we got to a point in society where gold
[57:46] just couldn't cut it anymore and we
[57:48] needed to we were accelerating in
[57:50] progress from you know on the back of
[57:52] the gold standard um to such a degree
[57:56] that it kind of broke the the system and
[57:59] we needed the fiat financial system to
[58:02] provide a bridge from that old world
[58:05] into the now new world that Bitcoin can
[58:07] provide where you don't need all of this
[58:10] credit in in order to bridge the gap
[58:12] between the movement of capital uh and
[58:15] the needs uh across the world. So,
[58:17] Bitcoin can can handle that and it
[58:19] allows us now to move back into a sound
[58:23] money standard. And we're starting to
[58:24] see the uh movements along those same
[58:28] lines across the world when it comes to
[58:30] like Doge and um the debalization that's
[58:34] happening. the old the the current world
[58:36] order is kind of breaking down and it's
[58:38] giving way to a more decentralized
[58:41] deglobalized type of world order which
[58:43] Bitcoin fits perfectly into. Um, you
[58:46] know, if you have like a lot of trust in
[58:48] society, credit works fine, but I don't
[58:51] know if you've noticed, but like that
[58:52] trust has been starting to erode a
[58:54] little bit across the world. And so,
[58:56] Bitcoin comes in as a neutral money and
[58:58] allows uh for us to continue forward in
[59:02] this more decentralized manner. Um, and
[59:04] and just looking back at the fiat world,
[59:06] it it was very helpful to be able to
[59:08] develop those systems to be able to
[59:10] bridge the gap between gold and and the
[59:12] new money standard, the new sound money
[59:14] standard, which is Bitcoin. I tend to
[59:17] agree with you. I I have a hard time
[59:19] believing that we don't have a ranking
[59:24] system, uh, keeping tab system, uh,
[59:27] point system, uh, whatever you want to
[59:30] call it.
[59:32] I just call it money. Um we we need that
[59:36] to progress uh to keeping uh things
[59:40] intact to keep incentives in intact. Um
[59:44] and there's this idea of yeah we will
[59:46] find unlimited energy then we can source
[59:49] the the robots and they but but there's
[59:51] still a lot to to do. There's there's no
[59:54] no real passiveness.
[59:56] Even if you have perfect knowledge,
[59:59] let's say you've got this like global
[60:01] network of general AI that can
[60:03] communicate instantaneously across the
[60:06] world and and share information. So
[60:07] you've got this like perfect information
[60:10] uh you know all knowing type of
[60:13] thing. You still h you still have an
[60:16] ordering problem for who needs what
[60:18] resources when and how quickly. So you
[60:22] still are not able to like instantly
[60:24] transport things from one point in space
[60:27] to another. I don't know, maybe we we
[60:29] solve that problem as well and you can
[60:32] just instantly in all cases have
[60:34] everything that you need. I just don't
[60:35] see that as as a realistic thing. But
[60:37] maybe my my understanding of quantum
[60:39] mechanics and the way the world work is
[60:42] is a little bit limited. I'll admit to
[60:43] that. May maybe we are too boomer to
[60:46] understand it. Yeah, absolutely.
[60:48] Absolutely.
[60:50] Um but yeah was was was a really uh cool
[60:54] talk. Um I've I I asked each and every
[60:57] one of my guests and I I can't remember
[60:59] if I asked you that uh in the previous
[61:01] episodes. I asked now since a few
[61:03] episodes uh every single every single
[61:07] guest what we can learn from you besides
[61:10] Bitcoin. Uh what would that be?
[61:14] Oh um what can you learn from me besides
[61:17] Bitcoin? Well, um I don't know. You
[61:19] you're you're catching me off guard
[61:21] here. Uh I think, you know, I'm very
[61:25] proud of the way that I've um you know,
[61:29] developed along my career as coming from
[61:32] a Bitcoin uh a a a banker turned
[61:35] Bitcoiner. um coming from like the fiat
[61:38] world, the traditional finance world,
[61:40] from the traditional FIRE world to uh
[61:43] adopting Bitcoin as kind of a primary
[61:46] savings vehicle there. Um but beyond all
[61:49] of that, you know, I have a beautiful
[61:51] family. Um I've got two young kids who
[61:54] are uh very active and I'm I'm lucky to
[61:57] be able to be in their lives and and
[61:59] helping to raise them. I've got a
[62:02] beautiful wife. um she's uh there and
[62:04] very supportive of me and this Bitcoin
[62:07] journey and and all of that. So um you
[62:09] know I think the important message
[62:13] beyond just like focusing on what's
[62:15] going on in the Bitcoin world that
[62:17] Bitcoiners are try to break through to
[62:20] the the the rest of the world and to
[62:22] Bitcoiners themselves is is go touch
[62:24] grass and really focus on the things
[62:26] that are important to you uh in the here
[62:29] and now and for your future. Um, it's
[62:31] not all about like how much can you
[62:33] stack? Uh, how much can you put away?
[62:35] Are you going to have enough money for
[62:37] the next hundred generations of your
[62:39] family? Like go out, uh, enjoy the
[62:42] world, experience things, travel, um,
[62:45] play golf, uh, if that's your thing, or,
[62:48] uh, you know, develop these hobbies that
[62:51] really allow you to grow into a
[62:53] well-rounded person. Uh, get get off of
[62:55] X every once in a while. I have a a bad
[62:57] problem with with checking the news flow
[63:00] and and doing all of that stuff. And and
[63:02] part of that is kind of built into into
[63:04] my job and the way that um I'm
[63:06] approaching, you know, what I'm working
[63:08] on these days. But it's important to be
[63:10] able to step back and and really take uh
[63:12] into account the the things that are
[63:14] truly important, which is our our
[63:16] relationships, our families, our
[63:17] friends, um and and really just enjoying
[63:20] this life that we have because again,
[63:22] you never know when the the current day
[63:24] could be your last. uh you you want to
[63:26] make the most of it. You're playing
[63:28] golf, right? I'm playing golf as as much
[63:31] as I can, which is not all that much
[63:33] when you've got a seven and
[63:34] nineyear-old, but uh uh I'm actually
[63:36] playing tomorrow. I've got um you know,
[63:38] some some golf with with a client coming
[63:40] up. Um I've got another event coming up
[63:43] uh next month uh or later this month as
[63:46] well. and um you know trying to
[63:49] incorporate Bitcoin and golf uh in in
[63:51] the best way that I can um you know to
[63:54] to kind of merge these two passions that
[63:56] I have. So we'll see. The weather's
[63:58] getting much better here, so uh
[64:00] hopefully be able to get out a little
[64:01] bit more. Uh I' I've been told it's
[64:04] addictive. Uh I've never been. and uh a
[64:08] friend of mine and a guest of mine,
[64:11] Daniel White, uh comes to Prague and he
[64:14] comes one day early and and visits me in
[64:15] Austria and we record a podcast and he's
[64:18] like, "Hey, come come come with me to
[64:20] the uh golf course." And I was like,
[64:22] "But I like and I've never held a golf
[64:25] uh thing in in my hand. So, I I'm I I'm
[64:29] pretty useless there, but we'll try it."
[64:31] Uh he warned me trying you know, it's
[64:33] not everybody's thing. Uh it takes a
[64:35] good amount of time. It's very
[64:37] difficult, you know. Um, you need to
[64:39] definitely put in some proof of work in
[64:41] order to to get any good at all at it.
[64:44] But that's part of why I like it, right?
[64:46] It's just such a a good challenge uh
[64:48] both mentally and emotionally and
[64:50] physically. Uh, and it's something that
[64:51] you can play, you know, for your whole
[64:53] life, right? You don't have to be uh in
[64:56] in great shape when you're 85 years old
[64:59] in order to play golf. You can still get
[65:01] around and get some good exercise. So, I
[65:03] think it's an important skill to to
[65:05] have. Um, and you know, we're fortunate
[65:06] in the US where there are golf courses
[65:08] everywhere. I don't know what that looks
[65:10] like in Austria, but uh in in Europe
[65:13] generally, I know it's they're kind of
[65:15] fewer and far between, but um you know,
[65:17] for for me, it's it's a really nice way
[65:20] to spend uh spend some time and get some
[65:23] fresh air and get some exercise and uh
[65:25] challenge myself both mentally and and
[65:28] physically. Is it addictive? Uh I I
[65:30] heard it. It definitely can be
[65:33] addictive. You know, it just depends on
[65:34] your your personality. But, uh, yeah,
[65:37] the those legends are true.
[65:41] Really cool. We have Andrew in the
[65:42] podcast where the previous guest is
[65:44] asking a question for the next guest
[65:45] without knowing who the next guest
[65:46] actually is. And the previous guest ask
[65:48] you the question, what would what will
[65:51] be the next uh what will be the first
[65:54] big nation state to mine Bitcoin? Oh,
[65:57] uh, Russia's already doing it, are they
[65:59] not? I think we already have that. Uh it
[66:03] sounds like the US is already um you
[66:07] know going to be contemplating that. I
[66:09] know for a fact that there are large uh
[66:11] energy companies that are starting to
[66:13] incorporate Bitcoin into their
[66:15] infrastructure either as pilot programs
[66:18] uh or the like. And then we just saw um
[66:21] the Trump family make an announcement
[66:24] about American Bitcoin which is um you
[66:26] know that's obviously not a government
[66:28] directly mining Bitcoin but it's pretty
[66:31] close. you know, you've got the
[66:32] administration with with eyes on that.
[66:34] So, um I don't know that the US will
[66:36] directly start doing that, but they're
[66:38] definitely facilitating an environment
[66:40] that is making it uh easy for the
[66:44] private sector to mine Bitcoin, which is
[66:45] really where it should happen. Um
[66:47] Russia's already doing it. They realize
[66:49] the importance of being able to access a
[66:52] financial instrument that the US does
[66:54] not control. Uh and so as the as the the
[67:00] US Treasury uh
[67:02] instruments continue to kind of fade
[67:05] away from being the primary uh store of
[67:08] value or reserve asset around the world.
[67:10] Um people are going to be looking for
[67:12] ways to acquire Bitcoin in a sovereign
[67:16] way where they don't have to buy it from
[67:17] somebody else but they can actually buy
[67:19] it in in the form of energy uh using
[67:21] assets that only they control within
[67:23] their jurisdiction. So, we're going to
[67:24] see more people copying what what Russia
[67:27] is doing. I don't know exactly who it's
[67:29] going to be. Uh probably the Chinese if
[67:31] they're not already doing it. Um and and
[67:35] more like centrally planned type
[67:37] economies who are just taking advantage
[67:39] of the the assets that they already kind
[67:41] of own there. Uh that that makes the
[67:43] most sense to me as the people who would
[67:45] be adopting mining on a sovereign level.
[67:49] I I haven't heard about Russia. So
[67:51] interesting. I have to look it up uh
[67:52] later. I I just tried to reach us a
[67:55] little bit now, but that's that's super
[67:57] I mean I think that every big nation
[67:59] state is already either buying or mining
[68:02] Bitcoin in in some capacity. Um but they
[68:06] haven't told us publicly. So So is like
[68:08] the the difference between doing it. I
[68:11] definitely think the number of those
[68:13] nation states that is doing it is is non
[68:16] zero for sure. Um and we've already seen
[68:18] some headlines for those but that's
[68:20] going to continue to grow. I mean, you
[68:21] know, the the announcement and the
[68:24] executive order from the Trump
[68:25] administration was was really
[68:27] a a shot heard he heard around the
[68:30] world. I think you know that the the
[68:32] next day every president, every central
[68:35] banker around the world got their daily
[68:38] briefing on their desk and it said the
[68:40] US has adopted a strategic Bitcoin
[68:43] reserve. uh you know that's going to
[68:46] create a ripple effect across the world
[68:48] uh as these these you know bureaucrats
[68:52] and presidents and central bankers
[68:55] consider what the next you know few few
[68:57] years and and decades are going to look
[68:59] like and and how they they plan for
[69:02] their geopolitical stance relative to
[69:04] the US. Um so we'll continue to see it
[69:07] the the price is not reflecting those
[69:09] fundamentals. It's weighed down by other
[69:10] uncertainty, but I think that's going to
[69:12] change here pretty soon. We'll have to
[69:14] see.
[69:15] 100%. And it it's so crazy for me
[69:19] because if you look at I mean Budan is a
[69:22] very small example. It's it's it's it's
[69:24] like it's half the size of of Vienna and
[69:26] Vienna is very small. Um but they have
[69:30] been mining from 2019 to 204 and
[69:34] probably announced it in 204. Uh I mean
[69:36] they're still mining. So they took five
[69:39] years to publicly announce how many
[69:41] countries small, big, mediumsiz,
[69:44] whatever, are buying and mining Bitcoin
[69:47] and doing it with no public knowledge at
[69:50] all. So it just makes you think will be
[69:54] fun to see. Um yeah, thank you so much
[69:55] Trey for uh for being on. Um before I
[69:58] let you go, I before already um put one
[70:02] time your your newsletter in in in the
[70:05] screen. uh where can they find it and
[70:06] where can they find you on on Twitter
[70:08] and stuff? Yeah, I appreciate that. Uh
[70:12] firebtc.substack.com. Uh I get a new
[70:14] issue out about every week and then I'm
[70:17] starting to follow that up with little
[70:19] video explainers that are on X and and
[70:21] you can follow me on X uh at
[70:24] ts_hddle. Um I've got a personal website
[70:26] treyellers.com. It's not overly active
[70:29] there, but you can find some interesting
[70:30] Bitcoin resources uh and some other
[70:32] links about, you know, some of the
[70:34] things that I've been working on, but um
[70:36] you really appreciate you you having me
[70:38] on, Robin. Really enjoy the
[70:39] conversation. Hopefully some people will
[70:41] learn a little bit about FIRE and and
[70:43] why it's important for them personally
[70:45] speaking. Um and you know, for for the
[70:48] FIRE proponents who this may uh may
[70:51] reach who have not yet considered
[70:52] Bitcoin, it's time, right? Like get off
[70:54] Zero, start learning about this asset.
[70:57] It's going to do wonders for your
[70:59] ability to to reach fire in a in a much
[71:02] more accelerated fashion. And check out
[71:04] the the newsletter. Hopefully, that will
[71:07] um you know, help help you understand it
[71:08] a little bit better. Really, I haven't I
[71:11] haven't thought about that. Maybe
[71:12] there's some file guy that clicks on on
[71:15] that video and we we should have made
[71:16] like a section with like why why
[71:18] Bitcoin, but then the podcast will be
[71:20] way longer. Yeah, there's there's plenty
[71:22] of resources for that, right? I I try to
[71:24] like put it together in the fire
[71:25] framework. Um, so we we'll see if that
[71:27] resonates. Absolutely. Yeah. Thank you
[71:29] so much for being on. Also, thank you so
[71:31] much for everyone that is watching and
[71:32] listening for joining us today. As
[71:34] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[71:35] another episode. Bye-bye.
