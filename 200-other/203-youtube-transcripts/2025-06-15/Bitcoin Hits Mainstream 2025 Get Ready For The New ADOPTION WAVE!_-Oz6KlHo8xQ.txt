[00:00] every cycle there's different types of
[00:01] people we started with crypto Anarchist
[00:03] the Libertarians the the tax heavy
[00:05] people and now more and more normal
[00:07] people get in the companies that are
[00:09] going to succeed in the future are the
[00:10] ones that are going to adapt Bitcoin
[00:12] first if you don't use your right to do
[00:14] something you're going to lose it even
[00:16] if you're only here for price then you
[00:18] should also self custody the only reason
[00:20] that the value of Bitcoin can go up if
[00:22] it remains scarse and we can only have
[00:24] true scarcity if we can verify Bitcoin
[00:27] blockchain that the Bitcoin are there if
[00:29] a lot of people put them on accounts or
[00:31] ETFs and they don't know for sure that
[00:33] they actually have these Bitcoin then
[00:35] these companies can do other things with
[00:36] that they have like a limit how much you
[00:38] can withdraw per per time frame that
[00:40] might seem far off for you but we also
[00:43] see that Bitcoin can increase fivefold
[00:45] or 10 fold in in a year and then
[00:47] suddenly you are reaching these limits
[00:49] Bitcoin is like the first asset that you
[00:51] can truly own nobody can take it away
[00:53] from you scaling options will grow
[00:55] faster when the pressure is higher and
[00:58] that will happen again when when
[00:59] transaction fees go up to100 and
[01:01] [Music]
[01:05] $1,000 what was like one of the most
[01:08] interesting things that happened in 2094
[01:10] in Bitcoin for you I think the overall
[01:13] acceptance of Bitcoin like globally um
[01:17] more people talking about more companies
[01:18] getting involved more institutions
[01:21] countries I I think that that's is a
[01:23] major thing right because um if we talk
[01:26] about Bitcoin like I said I don't want
[01:27] to talk about price too much but the the
[01:30] price right now is a reflection of where
[01:32] we were in the past meaning that um
[01:35] right now a lot of people have more
[01:36] confidence in Bitcoin and that it's
[01:38] going to be there for the long term uh
[01:40] than like a few years ago and I think
[01:43] the approval of the ETFs was definitely
[01:45] the biggest thing for that because when
[01:47] I talk to people about Bitcoin they
[01:49] always bring up that like oh the the
[01:51] government's going to ban it right
[01:53] there's other things are like things
[01:54] like environment and Etc and and that
[01:57] it's wasteful and that it's not valuable
[01:59] but biggest thing is like oh the
[02:00] government's going to ban it because
[02:01] they don't want uh another money that
[02:04] they can't control um and I think that
[02:06] that from my side it was also the
[02:08] biggest risk that I saw like sure you
[02:11] can ban it as a government and the
[02:13] network will continue to work right but
[02:14] if we if we just are with the few
[02:17] Bitcoins that we have right now few um
[02:21] then I don't think we have done what we
[02:23] said out to do we haven't won uh with
[02:26] Bitcoin what we what we wanted to do and
[02:29] now that that is I think mostly
[02:31] mitigated um starting with the ETS but
[02:34] also now with the election of trump who
[02:37] says he's a pro bitcoiner let's see if
[02:39] that comes to fruition right um I think
[02:42] a lot of risk has been has been
[02:44] mitigated and so more companies more
[02:47] institutions will come in but also more
[02:49] retail people um yeah will get into uh
[02:52] get into bit Bitcoin so now there's
[02:54] other other risk of course that are that
[02:56] I see as the biggest um but I think
[03:00] these are less visible to uh to normal
[03:03] audience like um there's all risk like
[03:06] around mining pool centralization
[03:09] privacy issues but those are not so
[03:12] visible to the starting bitcoiner I
[03:14] would argue absolutely yeah mining pool
[03:16] centralization is actually a topic that
[03:18] we covered uh two three times now in
[03:20] like I think the last three or four
[03:22] weeks um but yeah this this year was
[03:24] crazy with having ETF approval the
[03:28] presidential election we hitting the
[03:30] 100K like there so many there so many
[03:32] small milestones in in in packed in one
[03:35] year it's it's kind of crazy to think
[03:37] about that yeah and it's funny how
[03:39] quickly you you adapt to a new situation
[03:41] right because years ago maybe before you
[03:43] were here then a few K swing would be
[03:47] massive and now you just see it going
[03:48] from 100 to 105 to 95 you're like oh
[03:52] yeah that's just a bit of yeah variety
[03:55] of a a little bit of volatility while in
[03:57] the past that was huge right so um
[04:00] you start accepting these these larger
[04:03] deviations yeah that's that's actually
[04:05] crazy when you have like uh the the
[04:07] Bitcoin price reaching to over 100k it
[04:10] was with 104 then I think it touched
[04:12] down on 92 and now again 107 and I'm
[04:16] just thinking like I I came into Bitcoin
[04:19] when it was under
[04:21] 7K uh so and now we're swinging on a day
[04:25] on on a on like a weekly basis that that
[04:28] range so uh but yeah you you don't want
[04:30] to talk about price and I I I I like
[04:33] that a lot actually because I think we
[04:36] talking a lot of we usually talk too
[04:39] much about price I think the the price
[04:41] talk gets too much attention and I see
[04:43] it because I have a daily Bitcoin
[04:44] podcast and I rarely talk about PRI
[04:48] rarely I talk about price uh every once
[04:51] in a while if you do it seven times a
[04:53] week there's a lot of price talk also in
[04:55] there and I put it also on the fums and
[04:57] the titles and I just know like if
[04:58] there's a price in there people click on
[05:00] it that's that's the uh videos that
[05:02] unfortunately get more attention but I
[05:04] try to get those self custody this
[05:07] fundamental basis videos in uh and
[05:10] that's that's I think uh way more
[05:12] important how we grow a fundamental
[05:15] basis yeah let's be honest that's the
[05:17] way we all came into Bitcoin right
[05:18] because of price and uh it's dopamine
[05:21] driven so you want that quick
[05:22] satisfaction or uh approval of yes I did
[05:25] the right thing U but yeah I hope that
[05:28] other people the people that when they
[05:30] get into Bitcoin they also start
[05:31] learning about all the other aspects why
[05:33] it's valuable and um why they should
[05:35] also fight for certain things within
[05:38] bitco why is it uh now for the people
[05:40] and and I was astonished just to give
[05:43] you context here I was in Abu Dhabi at
[05:45] the Bitcoin conference uh and it was
[05:47] like a Bitcoin conference and in the
[05:50] room in the main stage someone asked on
[05:53] stage hey who has tried not not like who
[05:56] has self- custody who has tried self-
[05:58] custody and around 50% of the room uh
[06:03] lifted their hands and I think 50% is a
[06:06] good uh like they were already the the
[06:10] speaker said 50% but I thought like it
[06:12] was probably more like 30% raised the
[06:15] hands so it was not that that big of a
[06:19] of a of a thing um like why are not more
[06:23] people in self custody and why should
[06:26] those people uh that seem to be the
[06:29] majority not being in self- custody why
[06:31] should they be in self
[06:32] custody yeah I think there's two major
[06:35] reasons for that um one is the the
[06:38] technical aspect and um that you're
[06:41] suddenly on your own right there's no
[06:43] Bank to go to something goes wrong so a
[06:45] lot of people don't want to take that
[06:48] responsibility so there's that part and
[06:50] it's also a bit of yeah I think it's
[06:53] mostly they don't want to take that
[06:54] responsibility they think it's too
[06:56] technical Etc so they want to go into
[06:57] that and they don't see
[07:00] much of the reason for doing it although
[07:01] we try our best to educate them right we
[07:04] we show why they should be doing it and
[07:06] there's there's very good reasons to do
[07:07] self custody um of course there's all
[07:10] the exchanges that have issues like the
[07:12] last cycle the biggest one was FDX when
[07:14] they went back grup they missed 880,000
[07:18] Bitcoin so people that thought they had
[07:21] Bitcoin they saw it on their account
[07:22] they saw hey I have one Bitcoin with
[07:24] this value uh it actually wasn't there
[07:27] uh and they had nothing um when the
[07:30] company failed and that has happened so
[07:32] many times before that but we don't talk
[07:34] about that enough I would say because
[07:37] then we go into a new cycle new people
[07:39] come in and we talk about price and
[07:41] other things and adoption um but we
[07:44] should keep pointing out these risk
[07:46] there's some empty gogs and there's all
[07:47] kind of other exchanges and in the news
[07:50] they then say that Bitcoin was hacked or
[07:52] something like that right but that's
[07:53] never the case it's always these third
[07:56] parties um that say that they hold your
[07:58] Bitcoin that actually don't do it
[07:59] because they they do something else with
[08:01] it so that's one thing and the other
[08:03] thing is that if you want Bitcoin to
[08:06] succeed so even if you're only here for
[08:08] price then you should also self custody
[08:11] because the only reason that the value
[08:13] of Bitcoin can go up if it remain scarse
[08:16] and we can only have true scarcity if we
[08:19] can
[08:20] verify verify on the Bitcoin blockchain
[08:23] that the Bitcoin are there and that
[08:25] people are taking control of them
[08:27] themselves so if lot of people put them
[08:30] on accounts or ETFs and they don't know
[08:33] for sure that they actually have these
[08:35] Bitcoin then these companies can do
[08:36] other things with that so we always talk
[08:38] about 21 million but if they decide to
[08:42] loan them
[08:43] out then you suddenly have a larger
[08:46] Supply and that's that's what happened
[08:48] with the FDX collapse they loaned out
[08:49] Bitcoins from their clients because they
[08:52] expected the clients not to ask for them
[08:54] all at the same time it's very much the
[08:56] same as in traditional banking right
[08:58] it's fractional Reserve banking you you
[09:00] you say um you have a certain amount but
[09:03] you actually don't have all those coins
[09:06] so it's in
[09:08] self-interest if they want if they're
[09:09] here for number go up they shoot self
[09:11] custody if they want to protect their
[09:12] Bitcoin they shoot self custody if they
[09:14] want don't want to be vulnerable to uh
[09:18] government overreach they should self
[09:19] custody because what I see coming I mean
[09:22] you're in Europe as well right from one
[09:25] January a stricter regulations you now
[09:27] get the travel rule so every trans
[09:29] action that needs to that is performed
[09:32] between either a person and a company or
[09:35] between companies they needs to um
[09:39] accommodate transaction details like who
[09:41] is this person where does this person
[09:43] live what is the birth of date all this
[09:45] information now needs to be needs to be
[09:48] transferred so there we go I mean
[09:51] Bitcoin is never private right but these
[09:54] things doesn't help don't
[09:55] help um wait wait what is coming on
[09:58] first of January
[10:00] yeah so that's called the travel rule
[10:02] it's part of the M regulations okay I
[10:05] unfortunately I didn't study me even
[10:08] though I think I should but but
[10:11] but are you looking deeper in that in
[10:14] that topic do can you give us some
[10:16] overview of that um I'm I'm definitely
[10:19] not an expert on it but there's things
[10:20] like the travel rule so that means that
[10:22] if you perform a transaction there's now
[10:24] meta data that you need to share with it
[10:26] and that's not if you do it peer-to peer
[10:27] right if I buy something for you I can
[10:29] just do a Bitcoin transaction but if I
[10:31] buy uh Bitcoin on on coinbase and um I
[10:35] want to have it sent from coinbase to
[10:38] somewhere else they're going to uh
[10:41] append that data to it so your kyc
[10:43] information is now going to be shared
[10:45] with other parties so that's one thing
[10:48] and then there's all kind of Regulation
[10:50] around um education and services that
[10:54] you can provide so everybody kind of
[10:56] needs a license if they do something in
[10:58] in Bitcoin you're free to do
[11:00] like general education so talking about
[11:02] Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain uh in
[11:06] general but if you're giving people
[11:08] advice or you do specific
[11:09] recommendations not even Financial but
[11:11] saying hey I would recommend using this
[11:14] hardware for example um that you might
[11:17] be eligible to um needing that that
[11:20] license from marar which of course is
[11:22] very expensive so that will again drive
[11:24] centralization to to the bigger
[11:26] companies that can afford these licenses
[11:29] the smaller companies will have an issue
[11:31] with um keeping their head above water
[11:32] because they're either they going to
[11:35] ignore the rules or they're not going to
[11:37] be able to to pay for these uh for these
[11:39] licenses and do all the work to get the
[11:41] license Etc do I need that also as a a
[11:44] podcast host I don't think so um there's
[11:47] something you should look into is like
[11:49] uh around uh
[11:51] sponsorships like what what can you do
[11:53] what can you not do but I don't know the
[11:56] I don't
[11:57] know never thought that MAA is affecting
[12:01] my
[12:02] sponsorships it's it's crazy
[12:05] Europe yeah I think like think like
[12:07] referral Partners um we've seen that um
[12:10] that actually becomes harder and we've
[12:12] tried to collaborate with companies on
[12:14] on Europe and they said okay let's hold
[12:15] off for now we need to see exactly what
[12:17] it means in terms of regulations so
[12:19] we're we're more going to have like soft
[12:21] relationships with companies where we um
[12:24] where we like do webinars and we talk
[12:26] about our products but we don't do
[12:27] official referral part parnerships for
[12:30] now at least interesting yeah it's
[12:32] interesting that's why it's um important
[12:34] to get paid in Bitcoin directly then you
[12:38] can then you can over over jump the the
[12:42] exchanges I mean there also P2P
[12:44] exchanges uh or you could just go to a
[12:46] local Bitcoin Meetup maybe there is also
[12:48] some C collaboration going on um but
[12:52] yeah it's this the first year where I
[12:53] get paid in Bitcoin and I see all the
[12:55] benefits coming with that and yeah I I
[13:00] hope I hope it's I hope that the
[13:02] European union doesn't come to a place
[13:05] where bitcoiners have to leave um
[13:08] because either like either they leave or
[13:12] uh they get better if if they get
[13:14] constantly worse uh bitcoiners will
[13:17] start to leave they already starting to
[13:18] leave I I know several especially from
[13:20] Germany uh bitcoiners even famous ones
[13:24] uh that that completely left the country
[13:26] and say like oh goodbye I don't want to
[13:27] deal with that h anymore and that's just
[13:30] a thing that will continue which is sad
[13:33] because Europe is a extremely beautiful
[13:36] continent and I would I would hate to do
[13:38] leave but yeah if they always stop I
[13:42] leave yeah no and I I think a lot of
[13:44] people see the same um some people leave
[13:47] easier than others like depends on like
[13:49] do you have family and whatever or how
[13:52] tight are you to your place but um yeah
[13:55] I think it's something we all consider
[13:58] so so coming back to the why you should
[14:00] cost it right there's other things like
[14:03] a lot of uh exchanges they have like a
[14:06] limit how much you can withdraw per per
[14:08] time frame and that might seem far off
[14:11] for you right but we also see that
[14:14] Bitcoin can increase fivefold or tfold
[14:17] in in in a year and then suddenly you
[14:20] you are reaching these limits and they
[14:22] could lower these limits but I I I still
[14:25] think like okay the governments they
[14:27] accepted that Bitcoin is here right
[14:29] right they will continue to fight and I
[14:31] I think they will not fight so much the
[14:33] uh store of value but using Bitcoin as a
[14:36] form of payment I think that's mostly
[14:38] what they're going to fight so they want
[14:39] to try to keep it on their platforms
[14:41] that's what I assume meaning that I
[14:43] think they will lower these limits so
[14:45] let's say if you now have a 30k limit
[14:48] per month and they lower that to 5K per
[14:50] month right and your value of your stack
[14:53] increased at tenfold then suddenly that
[14:55] might mean that you can never get your
[14:57] Bitcoin from The Exchange again and it's
[14:59] it's interesting because I think they
[15:02] recognize they can't fight Bitcoin on
[15:04] the store of value it's just like it's
[15:06] it's already too deep in there uh but as
[15:09] a form of payment it's not yet fully
[15:12] there and even a lot of Bitcoin are
[15:14] saying a Bitcoin will never be a
[15:15] currency there are a lot of bitcoiners
[15:17] who say that I I will pull that
[15:19] statistic actually up I asked I think
[15:20] the community yesterday if you think the
[15:23] uh I think the question I asked was do
[15:27] you think Bitcoin will be a currency or
[15:30] not let me see if I can uh pull that up
[15:33] I'm of course logged in in the wrong
[15:36] account let's see if I can view my
[15:41] channel then is my podcast going
[15:45] directly starting Community I think
[15:48] there it should
[15:49] be um I will give it to you let's see
[15:54] screen window BM share
[15:59] um you see my screen uh where is it yeah
[16:04] will the whole world use Bitcoin as a
[16:06] primary currency at some point I mean
[16:08] it's just 600 votes so it's not even a a
[16:10] full day out there uh so it it usually
[16:14] they get like a th000 votes or something
[16:16] like that or 1.3 th000 votes here uh so
[16:19] it's definitely not a huge sample size
[16:22] but I think it's speaks uh volume to
[16:26] even the Bitcoin Community only thinks
[16:29] to two thirds that and those two thirs
[16:32] are probably the ones that are um the
[16:35] the the deepest in there that watch the
[16:37] podcast on a daily basis that uh uh vote
[16:41] on those daily uh things every day um
[16:46] where these are the questions and these
[16:49] are the people that are more likely to
[16:51] say yes than no uh so if we actually
[16:54] have the whole Bitcoin Community
[16:56] actually polling we're probably looking
[16:58] at like 50 50% maybe or like even under
[17:00] 50% of the Bitcoin Community believing
[17:03] that Bitcoin is um is a currency or a
[17:05] medium exchange at some point um so that
[17:09] that's one thing that's still attackable
[17:11] I feel
[17:13] like yeah
[17:15] and maybe I see it a little bit the
[17:17] other way around as well that it's also
[17:19] shown like 60% which is a lot right
[17:21] because most places you cannot pay with
[17:23] Bitcoin right now so most people have
[17:24] never experienced it if you never go to
[17:27] meetups where you can pay with Bitcoin
[17:28] if you never done it then then you
[17:30] probably also don't see it and I think
[17:33] the the people within Bitcoin uh that
[17:35] are coming every cycle there's different
[17:38] types of people right we we started with
[17:41] crypto Anarchist the Libertarians the
[17:43] the tax heavy people and now more and
[17:45] more normal people get in and I think
[17:48] they got in at the time of that that we
[17:51] promote Bitcoin as a store of value and
[17:53] not so much as a form of payment so I
[17:56] think this will change again over time
[17:58] but we we definitely need to do the work
[18:00] and yeah that is a lot of work right we
[18:03] need to convince both customers and
[18:06] companies to start paying and accepting
[18:09] Bitcoin and I think for some of us it's
[18:12] normal especially if you order something
[18:14] abroad right I always try to pay with
[18:16] Bitcoin and Bitcoin companies I try to
[18:18] pay with Bitcoin when I can we have um
[18:21] we have RM the first Bitcoin circular
[18:23] economy in the Netherlands where you can
[18:25] pay over 60 places with Bitcoin so is
[18:29] very well integrated but most people
[18:31] never see it I guess yeah the argument I
[18:34] always get is like oh you should save in
[18:36] the strong currency and spend the weak
[18:38] currency but then I'm more like if you
[18:41] spend the weak currency you also have to
[18:44] hold the weak currency so why not just
[18:47] hold the strong currency and spend in
[18:50] the strong currency so you don't even
[18:51] have to deal with the weak
[18:54] currency yeah I think what's also
[18:57] important is that um if you don't use
[18:59] your right to do something you're going
[19:01] to lose it so that that doesn't that
[19:03] applies to everything in general right
[19:05] if you don't use your right to privacy
[19:07] they're going to take your privacy if
[19:08] you don't use your uh right to uh to
[19:11] demonstrate they're going to take it
[19:13] from you and the same goes with Bitcoin
[19:14] if you if you're never going to pay with
[19:16] Bitcoin then there will be no um
[19:19] Investments so there will be no new
[19:21] software new hardware there will be no
[19:23] companies that that go into this so if
[19:26] you want to spend with Bitcoin then you
[19:28] should try to do it as much as you can
[19:30] that that's in your um you're
[19:32] incentivized to that and then when it
[19:34] comes to to paying yeah spending the we
[19:37] currency um I agree in the sense if you
[19:40] have Fiat right an income then it makes
[19:43] sense to First spend that but if you're
[19:45] unlike Bitcoin standard like you I think
[19:48] most of your income is through through
[19:50] Bitcoin then is then it's different
[19:53] right um but I mean there's not so many
[19:57] people that are 100% into Bitcoin
[19:59] with their savings and everything
[20:02] absolutely and it's even for me I have
[20:04] still feared income so um I don't know
[20:08] the percentage I should I should uh
[20:10] calculate it once but it's it's a it's a
[20:12] good amount that I still get in feed um
[20:15] and right now it's actually a nice thing
[20:17] where I can use my fear to pay my bills
[20:20] and the Bitcoin I paid I got paid in the
[20:23] last six months I think that then it
[20:26] started or five months ago or something
[20:27] like that I never spent them like I
[20:30] never had to spend them I never had to
[20:31] borrow against them I never had to do
[20:33] anything with that I could just like
[20:35] spend all the fear I get uh and I just
[20:39] like stack my Bitcoin with it's also
[20:41] like I didn't use an exchange for quite
[20:44] a while now because I don't have fat
[20:46] money that I could exchange for for
[20:48] Bitcoin I just like spend all the Fiat
[20:50] money I have uh I think my Bitcoin
[20:54] income probably will grow faster than my
[20:56] feat income uh but as long as I can do
[21:00] that that's the perfect situation where
[21:02] you can split your income uh and you can
[21:05] stack with your Bitcoin directly and all
[21:08] your feed income you can spend directly
[21:10] for your monthly bills that you in
[21:12] anyways have to pay yeah what I find
[21:15] mind-breaking is how it changes your
[21:18] behavior and perception if you're saving
[21:20] into Bitcoin so initially had still a
[21:23] large stack of Fiat right and then I
[21:25] thought okay you now Bitcoin is the
[21:26] better currency I will just keep my
[21:29] money to bitcoin and then suddenly you
[21:31] don't want to spend it anymore right
[21:32] because you're very well aware there's
[21:34] only 21 million other people are trying
[21:36] to acquired so that monthly FIA that you
[21:38] income that you get you you spend it
[21:40] easily you're like oh let's go for
[21:42] dinner let's do this because well
[21:43] there's another month and I will get
[21:45] more right but with your Bitcoin you're
[21:47] the other way around so if people are
[21:48] actually trying to to get the most
[21:51] Bitcoin as possible um I think it makes
[21:54] most sense to to convert all your money
[21:57] to bitcoin
[21:59] and then just spend from there and then
[22:00] you will see that you become much more
[22:02] frugal I mean maybe not everything but
[22:04] you get what I mean absolutely yeah um
[22:08] uh before we get to custody topic
[22:10] because that's really interesting um H
[22:13] how do you think we get to the point of
[22:16] uh actually a lot of people like now I
[22:18] don't know how many people actually
[22:21] spend Bitcoin on a daily or weekly basis
[22:24] it's probably uh very small amount a
[22:28] small group of people compared to like
[22:30] billions of people that we want to get
[22:33] on P of Bitcoin um what do you see has
[22:36] to happen in order to that we get there
[22:39] how far are we what what are you seeing
[22:41] in this scaling payments solutions for
[22:44] for Bitcoin yeah so I think technically
[22:47] most things can already be done for now
[22:50] like on Lightning although lightning
[22:52] will not be able to accommodate everyone
[22:54] I think it it can accommodate enough
[22:56] channels for now and there will ALS be
[22:58] people that use account based lightning
[23:01] right so having somebody else host their
[23:03] wallet I think the bigger thing is um
[23:07] how do you get companies and and
[23:09] customers to to use it and I always
[23:11] thought it would be the customers that
[23:13] had to go out like I need to go and say
[23:15] somewhere hey I want to pay with Bitcoin
[23:16] can I pay with Bitcoin no then I go
[23:19] elsewhere that was my thought now I
[23:21] think it's actually not like that I
[23:22] think it's actually the companies that
[23:24] that are the ones that should promote
[23:26] Bitcoin payments
[23:28] um I think this was on a podcast episode
[23:31] with Walker and I don't recall correct
[23:34] exactly but they were talking about okay
[23:37] uh the companies that are going to
[23:38] succeed in the future are the ones that
[23:40] are going to adapt Bitcoin first like
[23:43] for their Treasury and if you want to
[23:45] have it in your treasury then why not
[23:47] also accept it as a form of payment
[23:49] because then you don't have to do the
[23:50] conversion you can keep for example the
[23:52] the Bitcoin payments in your Treasury
[23:54] and the field payments you use for um
[23:56] for your cost Etc so typically what you
[23:59] see right on a on a Fiat standard is
[24:01] that prices of products they continue to
[24:03] increase and why is that because the the
[24:06] cost for the companies continue to
[24:08] increase it's it's part it's it's Goods
[24:10] um it's labor everything increases but
[24:13] if you now decide to store some of your
[24:18] um Capital into Bitcoin then you will
[24:20] see appreciated over time and then that
[24:23] part that you need to buy in a few years
[24:26] might have gone up in in field price 20%
[24:29] but the Bitcoin price might have dropped
[24:31] by 50% so you can choose what to do
[24:34] right you can keep your product price
[24:36] the same um you can build you can
[24:39] decrease the price you can build more
[24:41] products you can do other things so the
[24:44] companies that that start adopting a
[24:46] Bitcoin uh standard for that treasury I
[24:49] think are the ones that are going to win
[24:51] from their competitors and they those
[24:54] are the ones that will start
[24:56] understanding Bitcoin so initially they
[24:57] will have small TRS like oh I need to
[24:59] have some Bitcoin maybe 2% 5% whatever
[25:02] they start learning about Bitcoin and I
[25:03] think they also also start accepting
[25:06] Bitcoin as a form of payment and then I
[25:07] think the ball starts starts rolling I
[25:10] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[25:13] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[25:16] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[25:19] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[25:21] vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin watch

[25:28] go out there and show that you are a
[25:30] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[25:33] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[25:36] dropped a completely new and amazing
[25:39] Genesis edition of their watch
[25:42] collections you have the date of the
[25:44] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there

[25:50] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[25:53] the level of detail they put in in this
[25:56] masterpiece and make sure the check out
[25:58] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[26:01] down in the descriptions I love those
[26:04] watches so so much if you watch or
[26:07] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[26:09] I'll guess you already bought some
[26:12] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[26:14] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[26:18] in a hardware wallet my personal
[26:19] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[26:21] the bit box it's super secure it's
[26:24] simple to set up it's also perfect gift

[26:43] an individual you have to have the most
[26:46] secure self- custody setup you have to
[26:49] secure your own devices you have to
[26:52] protect your privacy you have to set up
[26:55] an inheritance plan and depending on
[26:57] where you live you you even want to have
[26:59] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[27:02] move in case something goes really
[27:04] really wrong and through all those steps

[27:16] minute free call to find out how you can
[27:19] level up your sovereignty absolutely
[27:23] just I I always bring that Red Bull
[27:25] example up um in the beginning when Red
[27:27] Bull made marketing they literally paid
[27:30] people to go in restaurants and bars to
[27:32] say hey ask them for Red
[27:36] Bull and and if you're like a bar and
[27:38] like there's like the the third guy
[27:40] coming in this evening asking like hey
[27:42] do you have Red Bull and then the next
[27:43] week A salesperson of Red Bull comes
[27:45] along and says like hey um do you want
[27:48] to offer Red Bull in your bar you're way
[27:50] more likely to listen to them if there
[27:53] already people ask for for Bitcoin so I
[27:55] feel like it's it's a mix of like custom
[27:58] wanting to pay with Bitcoin and making
[28:01] that clear to to the merchant but then
[28:04] also we need the the salese coming into
[28:08] the shop and saying like hey if you want
[28:10] to add Bitcoin as a payment method um
[28:13] here's a really easy way to do that that
[28:15] device costs uh costs nothing you can do
[28:17] it on your phone but you can also
[28:19] purchase an extra device but you can
[28:21] also do it with a phone there's a free
[28:24] software it just has like a small
[28:25] percentage of like whatever how those
[28:28] models are going uh which is super easy
[28:30] super nice to uh adopt so I think we
[28:33] need a lot of strategies and I know
[28:36] people that religiously ask every time
[28:39] they are somewhere hey can I pay with
[28:42] Bitcoin and I love those people because
[28:44] those are the religious Bitcoin payment
[28:48] method lovers that we need to spread
[28:51] that adoption H I rarely do that uh
[28:56] asking for Bitcoin payments first of all
[28:58] I usually only have like uh 20 to 30 EUR
[29:01] on my my lightning wallets uh so
[29:04] sometimes I cannot even pay with
[29:05] lightning and then I should not ask when
[29:07] I cannot pay then uh but it's also like
[29:10] a weird feeling I'm I'm I'm way more
[29:13] introverted to do
[29:15] that yeah I think most people are not
[29:17] comfortable with doing that I I totally
[29:20] understand it's a bit of a strange thing
[29:22] to ask I find myself as well and it's
[29:25] interesting most people don't want even
[29:26] want to spend their Bitcoin so that's
[29:28] what you mean that we have work to do on
[29:30] that side as well even at the the
[29:33] Bitcoin conferences most aside from a
[29:37] few that are that people pay with
[29:39] Bitcoin but most of the beer conference
[29:41] most people spend with their Fiat with
[29:42] their credit cards and I run a web shop
[29:45] for a while a Bitcoin web shop um for
[29:49] for signing devices Hardware
[29:51] wallets and even if you say okay uh
[29:54] paying with Bitcoin is cheaper uh you
[29:56] get a 5% discount I prefer a Bitcoin
[29:59] payment because I can directly put it
[30:01] into my treasury then still 50% of the
[30:04] people decides to pay with Fiat so they
[30:07] they accept the higher cost because they
[30:08] don't want to spend um from their
[30:12] stack yeah you have to give them a
[30:14] discount uh it seems like that's how how
[30:17] it works you have to get like a 10% or
[30:19] 15% discount for Bitcoin payments then
[30:22] you might get might end up with getting
[30:25] some more Bitcoin customers can make a
[30:28] sense also because it goes directly in
[30:30] your wallet and use and you can stack it
[30:32] don't have to buy it and stuff like that
[30:34] if you're bitcoiner uh and you offer a
[30:36] service uh you you should offer a
[30:39] discount for for Bitcoin payments I feel
[30:41] like that's could could be a good good
[30:43] move for for you and the business yeah
[30:46] if you can put it in your treasury if
[30:47] you need to convert it to for cost then
[30:49] it doesn't make sense right so um and
[30:52] yeah not a topic to go into but the
[30:54] margins are on the Bitcoin business like
[30:56] sign devices they are so extremely slame
[30:58] that you almost cannot give discounts oh
[31:01] yeah that's that that that that's also
[31:04] true Bitcoin businesses in general have
[31:06] it hard I feel like well that's a
[31:08] Bitcoin a problem right because we're we
[31:10] all kind of frugal and people are also
[31:12] very excited to do something in this
[31:14] space so a lot of people they just run a
[31:16] service or a company next to a fi job
[31:18] they feel hey I'm I'm here to u to help
[31:21] Bitcoin adoption I'm educating I'm I'm
[31:23] providing service and I don't need to
[31:25] make money from it and I understand that
[31:28] reasoning but because of some people
[31:30] have very low prices because of that
[31:32] because they do it as a side hustle that
[31:34] also means that the people that want to
[31:36] do it as a full-time job have a hard
[31:38] time to to compete right because if you
[31:40] have to live from that then you need to
[31:41] make more money very true yeah I mean I
[31:44] a that jump with the podcast and uh it
[31:47] luckily I I can pay my bills uh and I I
[31:51] can even stack Bitcoin to certain degree
[31:54] not getting rich from that to be honest
[31:57] uh but it's just the first year and I'm
[31:59] really happy with that that it's
[32:00] possible uh but yeah it's it's um
[32:04] Bitcoin businesses don't have too much
[32:06] money to to throw around I mean it feels
[32:09] like exchanges and Mining is is the more
[32:12] the the bigger ones the big exchanges
[32:14] and big mining big mining operations uh
[32:18] making a lot of money but uh there's not
[32:20] too many of of of of those I I have no
[32:22] clue about the signing devices what
[32:24] their Mar is looking like and and how
[32:26] how they operating
[32:29] do you have some interest
[32:30] there um not something I want to address
[32:33] because I stopped that business and uh I
[32:36] think that would be better to discuss
[32:37] with someone that is still in that field
[32:39] absolutely yeah really cool perfect and
[32:41] let's go uh to our the topic that we
[32:44] wanted to First discuss is is uh
[32:47] custodians and and and we already
[32:49] discussed why it's so important um what
[32:51] options uh do we have to store Bitcoin
[32:54] what are the kind of like what are the
[32:55] things that you're looking at yeah so
[32:57] that's a good question so first let's an
[32:59] introduction so what does custody
[33:01] actually mean right so I think Bitcoin
[33:03] is unique asset people might not realize
[33:05] that especially if they are familiar
[33:06] with things like ETFs and exchanges but
[33:09] Bitcoin is like the first asset that you
[33:11] can truly own and so no but nobody can
[33:14] take it away from you right so that
[33:16] that's very interesting aspect of
[33:18] Bitcoin um so so that means that you can
[33:20] self custody it and you you have full
[33:24] control you can protect your private
[33:26] keys and nobody can take from
[33:28] you then another thing is
[33:31] that when we talk about custody um a lot
[33:36] of people on the on on X or Twitter like
[33:38] to say that custody is easy it's just
[33:42] remembering 12 words or writing down 12
[33:44] words and anyone can do that and I think
[33:47] that's falsely advertising what self
[33:50] custody mean means because it's much
[33:52] more comprehensive than that and there's
[33:54] a lot of nuances and risk involved with
[33:56] custody so
[33:58] I would say that Bitcoin custody is not
[34:00] free you always need to do a investment
[34:03] you either need to do a Time investment
[34:04] to learn what it what it means to
[34:06] custody it yourself and what comes into
[34:08] play what what equipment do you need how
[34:11] does work with inheritance planning um
[34:13] how do I protect myself Etc or you go um
[34:18] with a commercial solution that helps
[34:20] you out with that and then you pay uh
[34:22] with do a monetary payment so either you
[34:24] need to invest time or money for proper
[34:27] custody
[34:28] and of course if you just have a very
[34:29] small amount that doesn't really apply
[34:31] so then when it comes to
[34:34] custody um yeah you you basically have
[34:38] three different types so you have the
[34:39] account based custody right so that's
[34:42] your exchange uh your ETF your dig
[34:47] digital asset manager and that's what
[34:49] like you mentioned a lot of people use
[34:51] right you saw that uh during the Bitcoin
[34:53] conference that most people didn't try
[34:54] self Cary themselves so they they keep
[34:56] it on an account based
[34:58] and this means that um it's very simple
[35:00] right it's it's user friendly you just
[35:02] can buy your Bitcoin there and you leave
[35:04] it there um of course the major
[35:07] disadvantages are is that you're
[35:10] completely relying on this third party
[35:12] like we already mentioned um you don't
[35:14] know if the the Bitcoin that is being
[35:15] displayed on um on your screen if it's
[35:18] fully backed or not um and it doesn't
[35:21] follow uh bitcoin's decentralization EOS
[35:24] and there's other uh risk with that so
[35:26] typically we say okay we don't want to
[35:28] use that custody model which is like
[35:30] account based model we want to we want
[35:32] people to self custody so taking control
[35:34] of their
[35:36] funds and then on the um so if if you do
[35:40] self custody you can again split it up
[35:43] um so self custy means that you have
[35:46] onchain verifiable Bitcoin so you can
[35:48] see that on the Bitcoin blockchain you
[35:50] can verify that the amount is there in
[35:53] an address that you
[35:55] control there you have two options again
[35:57] you have have the one that you take full
[35:59] responsibility meaning um if you do
[36:02] something wrong um you lose the Bitcoin
[36:05] right so you are fully responsible for
[36:06] managing everything and the big
[36:08] Advantage there is that you have full
[36:10] ownership and you can verify it on the
[36:13] blockchain the disadvantage there is
[36:15] that it requires significant education
[36:18] uh it requires some technical expertise
[36:21] and there's risk right to like privacy
[36:23] loss um a faulty device um how do you
[36:28] plan your inheritance these kind of
[36:30] details and then the other way to do it
[36:33] is that you have like onchain onchain
[36:36] Bitcoin with a shared responsibility so
[36:39] instead of being Solly responsible you
[36:42] can work with a third party or more
[36:44] third parties um to share the control
[36:47] and then again the advantage is that you
[36:49] have Bitcoin on the blockchain so you
[36:50] can see that it's there uh you control
[36:53] one or more of the private Keys uh to
[36:55] interact with the Bitcoin and
[36:58] um it mitigates much of the risk that
[37:00] you are um the single point of failure
[37:04] the disadvantage of course there is that
[37:06] you have dependen on like a third party
[37:09] uh which have some has some risk with it
[37:11] as well and there's of course a monetary
[37:14] costs involved with that so that's
[37:16] basically the how you can split it
[37:19] up um and then if you if you look at
[37:23] again on the onchain uh field you again
[37:26] have different layers right so you have
[37:27] single signature multi signature and all
[37:29] these different types that we can talk
[37:31] about if you if you like to yeah I think
[37:34] it's super interesting also to know like
[37:38] um because a lot of people when they
[37:41] come into of custody probably start with
[37:44] some signing device a bit boox a
[37:45] treasure whatever uh and uh at some
[37:48] point they realize oh like the value of
[37:51] that one single signal is already too
[37:53] much and now I want to get into multi
[37:55] signature collaborative multi signature
[37:58] whatever the the things is or working
[38:00] with an advisor um when is the when
[38:04] would you recommend to like step up your
[38:07] game from I mean of custody for me it's
[38:10] like uh you can do it from from the
[38:13] first EUR onwards uh I mean if you wait
[38:16] till like 500 EUR or like some
[38:18] insignificant amount it's it's fine
[38:20] especially as a utxo management then uh
[38:22] comes into place we can also discuss
[38:24] that a little bit later what that is and
[38:26] and and what role does it play but when
[38:28] do you recommend of like going uh from
[38:31] single s to multi or some some other
[38:33] Solutions do you have some models of
[38:35] like where you need to be yeah that's a
[38:37] a very interesting question so I have a
[38:41] consultancy business where I educate
[38:43] people on custody and what I've seen
[38:45] over the years is that if you try to
[38:47] take them that traditional path right
[38:49] then you start talking about single sck
[38:51] multi signature you see two things a lot
[38:53] of people find it complicated
[38:56] overwhelming
[38:57] if you start addressing the risk they
[39:00] they feel like oh I'm not up to it so
[39:02] what I've seen is people they either
[39:03] don't start with Bitcoin at all so they
[39:05] didn't get that nice exposure and
[39:07] they've missed out on purchasing power
[39:09] go up over the last years um or they
[39:12] decided to leave it on an exchange
[39:15] because they don't want to go that route
[39:17] so i' I've started to actually tackle it
[39:19] from the other way around and that is my
[39:23] goal is really to get Bitcoin off
[39:24] exchanges because Bitcoin on exchanges
[39:28] is not the Bitcoin itos is not
[39:29] decentralization it's centralized and it
[39:32] it it doesn't reflect what we want to do
[39:34] so the goal is to get Bitcoin off the
[39:36] exchanges and then I actually now
[39:39] recommend for most people if they just
[39:40] want to get started um to actually get
[39:43] into collaborative custody if they have
[39:45] a significant amount so like you said it
[39:47] also depends on the amount right if you
[39:50] just have like1 EUR and it's playing
[39:52] money then I feel like maybe you should
[39:54] just leave it on Exchange or
[39:58] or or learn at your own pace what you
[40:00] want to do but if it's significant
[40:01] amount so you have people now that feel
[40:03] like hey I'm now getting convinced of
[40:06] Bitcoin I I need to do something here
[40:07] let's put in 5K or 10K then I think
[40:11] going the um single s rout still leaves
[40:15] you exposed to all kind of risks and
[40:19] mostly tied to the user right because
[40:21] there's so much things you need to
[40:23] understand and educate on uh to get it
[40:26] right
[40:27] that most people won't spend the time
[40:29] and then you can either do a monetary
[40:31] investment of course to to learn all
[40:33] that or you start with a collaborative
[40:36] mulick solution so in a collaborative
[40:39] multi- solution there's no single party
[40:41] that can transfer the funds you always
[40:43] need to collaborate with a
[40:46] party uh that way you can um mitigate uh
[40:50] single points of
[40:51] failure they can already get their
[40:53] Bitcoin safely off an exchange and feel
[40:55] comfortable with he Bitcoin um in a self
[40:59] custody model and then they can learn
[41:02] right so if they want to transfer to a
[41:04] model other model in the future or if
[41:06] they want to uh use a split security
[41:08] model they can take that time to educate
[41:11] themselves but in the meantime their
[41:12] Bitcoin is safe it's not vulnerable in
[41:14] an exchange it's not vulnerable to a
[41:16] single point of failure which is
[41:19] typically the case with a single sick so
[41:22] what what I see is more more and more
[41:24] people doing that way is going to
[41:26] collaborative uh security model and then
[41:30] uh depending on on how interested they
[41:32] are they might take um another route as
[41:36] well and one thing to consider also is
[41:39] that there's different security models
[41:41] with different
[41:43] risks right and maybe we need to explain
[41:46] a little bit more what collaborative
[41:47] security is right so so let's say we
[41:51] talk about collaborative security with
[41:53] three
[41:55] parties you would have a multi wallet
[41:58] with three key holders and there's
[42:02] always two key holders that need to sign
[42:04] to perform a transaction so for example
[42:07] you Robin would be a key holder um a
[42:11] party that you collaborate with and then
[42:14] there's a a third party that comes into
[42:17] play if there is an
[42:18] issue so you have this nice triangle of
[42:21] of of groups that cannot interact on
[42:23] their own they always need to
[42:25] collaborate so if you want to do a
[42:26] transaction work with your uh provider
[42:29] you do the transaction but if something
[42:31] happens to you if you you pause away you
[42:33] you lose your signing device you still
[42:35] have those other two parties that you
[42:36] can instruct to perform the transaction
[42:39] for
[42:39] you and that way when one of the parties
[42:43] um cannot sign anymore you still have
[42:47] two parties that to inform a transaction
[42:49] so that's what collaborative security is
[42:52] then if if you have a larger part of
[42:56] your saves into Bitcoin that you need to
[42:58] consider your security right and I think
[43:00] one thing that
[43:02] people might not do very well is uh
[43:05] understanding risk but also the
[43:08] understanding the risk of the different
[43:10] security security models that there are
[43:12] so for example we see people on the
[43:14] internet saying hey I have 10 Bitcoin I
[43:17] split it over 10 different wallets to
[43:20] mitigate
[43:21] risk then that's not a good way to
[43:23] mitigate risk because those 10 wallets
[43:26] if you chose to save way of creating
[43:28] them they're still vulnerable to the
[43:29] same issue for example if that's 10
[43:32] private Keys um if you don't leave
[43:36] proper documentation of where those
[43:37] private keys are then at the time of
[43:40] you're passing away all those Bitcoins
[43:42] are lost right so you need to consider
[43:46] okay should I look at different uh
[43:49] models and and that's what we see so if
[43:51] people go into collaborative security
[43:53] and they're they're into learning and
[43:55] they want to do more they can actually
[43:57] take part of their funds and store it in
[43:59] a different model where they have the
[44:01] majority of the keys and where they
[44:02] control the Bitcoin but we still
[44:04] recommend to to look maybe at different
[44:07] models to to to split the risk basically
[44:11] interesting it's you have to uh at some
[44:15] point you come to the conclusion of uh
[44:18] you you you maybe want to in invite more
[44:22] than just yourself into your custody
[44:24] solution especially when you think about
[44:26] in parentons uh what happens if you have
[44:29] an accident what happens if you have a
[44:31] brain injury like there's a lot of
[44:33] things that can happen so you should
[44:35] definitely have um maybe some family
[44:38] member maybe a trusted third parties
[44:40] maybe whatever like think about what
[44:44] happens if you are not there anymore or
[44:46] what happens if you are still there but
[44:48] not capable of doing it uh is there
[44:50] someone that can help you out is there
[44:52] someone that uh knows what to do in
[44:56] those certain
[44:57] uh circumstance circumstances uh and the
[45:00] older you get the more important you get
[45:02] but I think a lot of young bitcoiners
[45:03] make the mistakes of like ah like that's
[45:05] that's a topic of future future Robin I
[45:08] don't have to do that right now so
[45:10] really think about that I think that's a
[45:12] great advice yeah and I think that
[45:14] that's actually very interesting right
[45:15] because that's something we don't do as
[45:17] bitcoiners I also don't think there's
[45:19] very good reports on this like how do
[45:21] you do a risk assessment and I don't
[45:23] think everybody should do that for
[45:25] themselves because that's not something
[45:27] you can expect but um some prominent
[45:30] people should probably publish on this
[45:34] because people they learn by listening
[45:36] to others right they learn okay I need
[45:38] to have my seat phras I need to have it
[45:40] stemed into seal um I need to have a
[45:42] proper backup and I need to store it at
[45:44] a secure place but that's kind of where
[45:46] it stops but if it's your life savings
[45:49] or if you say hey this is something I
[45:51] want to leave to my kids in 20 30 years
[45:54] because they will be well off then you
[45:56] need to you better be sure of what all
[45:57] the uh risks are and you have ways of
[46:01] doing that and without becoming too
[46:03] technical but you have technology that's
[46:05] called failure modes and effects
[46:07] analysis so if you have Bitcoin custody
[46:10] you can Define your failure modes and
[46:12] then you can Define okay what can go
[46:14] wrong so for example you can say a
[46:17] failure mode is a device failure right
[46:19] so you can have a signning device like a
[46:21] treasure a foundation passord whatever
[46:24] what happens if that device breaks right
[46:27] did I mitigate uh what would happen in
[46:30] that case and of course you should have
[46:32] a proper backup yeah have you tested
[46:34] that backup properly that that's not a
[46:36] question another failure could be a user
[46:39] error error so we all know that doing
[46:42] Bitcoin transactions is still kind of uh
[46:45] if you do a large transaction you your
[46:46] heart rate goes up right because you
[46:48] know that if you make a mistake you you
[46:50] cannot go back so there's another um
[46:54] risk that you make an an error doing
[46:57] during a transaction or verifying it or
[46:59] sending it um you leaking your private
[47:02] key right that your private key gets
[47:04] compromise so if you have a single
[47:06] signature how do you plan inheritance
[47:10] that's very complicated because you
[47:11] cannot just leave that key with a family
[47:13] member or with your will because the
[47:16] person that access that key has access
[47:19] to your Bitcoin if you then decide to
[47:21] protect it with a passphrase and you put
[47:23] that pass phrase in a second
[47:24] location then you your beneficiaries
[47:27] they need to have both
[47:30] that uh seed phrase and that PA phrase
[47:33] how do you guarantee that they actually
[47:35] get that so it's very nuanced and very
[47:39] um complicated to um to address all that
[47:43] by yourself without yeah going deep into
[47:46] the weed so that's why I definitely
[47:48] recommend people to to either educate
[47:51] themselves or seek some some guidance
[47:54] and
[47:57] you you won't hear too many stories of
[47:58] things that go wrong right because
[48:00] people like to celebrate their successes
[48:02] they celebrate how much money they made
[48:04] their value of their Bitcoin going up
[48:06] they buy a nice expensive Lamborghini
[48:08] but they don't talk about the Bitcoin
[48:10] that they lost but there's a lot of
[48:11] people that have lost Bitcoin and it
[48:13] will be more and more in the future why
[48:16] because most of the bitcoiners are
[48:18] unfortunately male between 25 and 40 so
[48:22] we still have quite a long way until we
[48:24] pass away hopefully but at that time
[48:27] have we all did the right thing to make
[48:30] sure that our family members can inherit
[48:33] that those Bitcoin I don't think so but
[48:35] we cannot think that far ahead and
[48:37] that's actually very um uh interesting
[48:40] there is um there's an an article
[48:42] somewhere on the internet I can send it
[48:44] to you later where they um had young
[48:46] people think about like the present and
[48:49] like further into the future like when
[48:51] they retire or whatever and then you see
[48:53] that they you're thinking about that
[48:55] with different parts of your brain
[48:58] so you it's very hard to actually think
[49:01] about what will happen in 40 years right
[49:04] so we so we dismiss that and we don't
[49:07] take care of
[49:08] it and that that that's a problem
[49:10] because you should you should think
[49:12] about your inheritance if if you want to
[49:14] transfer your Bitcoin to someone in the
[49:16] future you should think about it now
[49:20] right that's a super important Point um
[49:24] I just want to highlight uh
[49:27] because if if people actually never
[49:29] heard a story of how someone lost a lot
[49:32] of Bitcoin um I made very early on it's
[49:35] it's an episode 10 months ago with with
[49:39] Rick uh the the episodes where he went
[49:42] through a story of losing 25 Bitcoin um
[49:46] it's the only story that I cover in
[49:49] depth with him because he's willing to
[49:51] share a lot of people that lose the
[49:54] Bitcoin are not willing to share that
[49:55] story in in from being so vulnerable and
[49:59] actually doing that and he went uh
[50:02] through uh he did self custody he he was
[50:05] on bitcoin conferences like he he he was
[50:08] not the he he was probably even smarter
[50:13] than the the average bitcoiner uh so he
[50:17] but he did some mistakes and we went
[50:19] through them in that video also uh and
[50:22] how he lost it so it it was really
[50:24] interesting for me to see and this video
[50:26] was was for me actually after that video
[50:29] I I went through my whole setup
[50:31] and improved it a lot I think uh and so
[50:35] hearing a story how someone actually
[50:37] lost 25 Bitcoins by the way multiply
[50:39] that with 100K
[50:41] now that's a lot of money uh it it
[50:45] really opens your eyes to to the
[50:47] possibilities uh and it's like oh yeah
[50:50] there are people that lost their Bitcoin
[50:52] in then in that case there were thieves
[50:53] and it was not a user error where he got
[50:56] cut out or something like that it was
[50:58] actually someone sealing his Bitcoin
[51:00] most likely even like kind of a targeted
[51:03] attack uh but yeah we don't know for
[51:06] sure what what what it was but
[51:08] definitely someone stole his Bitcoin uh
[51:11] May lost probably is the wrong word that
[51:13] I lost used in the thumbnail but he
[51:15] actually got 25 Bitcoins stolen from him
[51:20] uh that that those are real stories that
[51:23] actually
[51:24] happens yeah and and we see those
[51:26] stories as well um we see people making
[51:29] uh an improper backup right and then not
[51:32] properly testing it and but the thing is
[51:34] again I I know Rick's story I've read
[51:36] I've read up on it when it happened and
[51:38] I I followed it closely but at that time
[51:41] you learn about those risk and you can
[51:43] mitigate those right but the thing is
[51:45] what are the things that I haven't
[51:47] accounted for that's very hard to to
[51:49] understand
[51:50] and I know that most bit Bitcoins they
[51:53] don't want to spend money on their
[51:55] security and I also understand why that
[51:59] is but on the other hand I think you
[52:01] should really consider okay I'm aside
[52:04] from Bitcoin being peer top Etc if you
[52:06] here for the N Go up you want to see
[52:08] your purchasing power go up and you
[52:10] don't want to go see it go to zero so
[52:12] even if you have to pay a small fee um
[52:14] so if you pay 1% per year but you see a
[52:18] compound enal growth rate of 40% then
[52:21] instead of 40% you make 90% per year
[52:23] right but that way you can sleep well
[52:26] you have proper for custody Etc and if
[52:29] everything goes to zero then you yeah
[52:32] you're just going to blame yourself and
[52:33] those stories are also there people yeah
[52:37] that that lost their Bitcoin and
[52:39] um yeah that that's a a very tough thing
[52:41] to get over of course and afterwards you
[52:44] know what you did wrong but not at that
[52:46] uh at that time absolutely very true um
[52:50] one other uh important thing that we
[52:52] touched on a little bit uh was UT takes
[52:54] o management um and I have a really
[52:58] important uh I made a long video on that
[53:02] on on my channel to to go deep on that
[53:04] it was like an hour and 10 minutes or 20
[53:07] minutes or something like that uh long
[53:09] uh but may maybe uh for people that
[53:12] don't know like what is it and and why
[53:15] should we care about utxo management
[53:18] yeah so utxo management so already the
[53:21] name it's very technical right so utxo
[53:25] stands for on UNS span transaction
[53:28] output um some wallets just call it a
[53:31] coin which is a bit easier to
[53:34] understand so you can have multiple
[53:36] coins in your wallet just like in a a
[53:38] physical wallet and the same goes for
[53:42] utxos and then when it comes to to
[53:44] managing those yeah there there's very
[53:46] different nuances to it actually so it's
[53:48] it's not too easy uh to explain but one
[53:52] of the core things to consider is that
[53:55] you don't want to to small of a coins in
[53:58] your wallet because in the future you
[54:01] might not be able to spend those and why
[54:02] is that we see that the transaction fee
[54:05] they go up over time right so right now
[54:08] the transaction fees I think like1 or2
[54:10] dollar per
[54:11] transaction um so if you would now have
[54:13] a coin that's a value of $1 then you
[54:16] would never spend it because it's
[54:17] already the same expense after
[54:19] transaction so assuming that transaction
[54:21] code costs go up to100 or $1,000 that
[54:25] would mean that at that time uh a coin
[54:28] of a hundred or $1,000 becomes
[54:31] unsp so that's one thing is that if you
[54:34] have very small coins for example if you
[54:36] buy weekly and you put it in your cold
[54:38] storage then you should consider uh
[54:41] consolidating those so putting them
[54:43] together and make one larger
[54:45] coin now the problem with doing that is
[54:47] that Bitcoin is not private right so yes
[54:52] there's no names on the Bitcoin
[54:54] blockchain but you can still follow all
[54:56] the transactions so if as soon as you
[54:59] combine multiple coins into one yeah
[55:03] then you can see the history so you knew
[55:04] that these all came uh from the same
[55:06] place probably and that they're now one
[55:09] coin so they're now um yeah from the
[55:12] same person so if you want to do that
[55:15] then you should consider like okay where
[55:18] did these original coins come from did
[55:20] one come from for example coinbase and
[55:23] did one come from um a peer-to-peer
[55:27] transaction then you might you probably
[55:29] want to keep those separated so you
[55:31] probably want to have or that a lot of
[55:35] people do that they have like what they
[55:36] call kyc coins so which for which they
[55:39] know your account details right because
[55:41] they came from exchange or whatsoever
[55:43] and then you have non kyc coins that you
[55:45] either uh earned by mining or by doing
[55:48] labor or you bought them on a non kyc
[55:52] exchange yeah so you probably want to
[55:55] keep uh those
[55:57] apart then another thing is if you spend
[56:00] Bitcoin then again the transaction is
[56:03] visible right so let's say you think
[56:05] okay I'll just consolidate everything
[56:07] into one transaction in one coin uh
[56:10] because that's nice and easy and I'm
[56:11] going to save it for the future and you
[56:12] consolidate everything into one Bitcoin
[56:15] then in the future if you're going to
[56:16] spend that
[56:18] coin
[56:20] um the the whole coin will be
[56:22] transferred and visible on the
[56:24] blockchain so if I pay you 50 50 in the
[56:27] future and my Bitcoin is worth a million
[56:30] and you say hey can you send me 50 I pay
[56:32] Robin 50 and in your wallet you can see
[56:36] that you got a very small portion of my
[56:38] coin but that other part went back to my
[56:41] wallet and suddenly you know that I have
[56:43] one Bitcoin minus those 50 Euro so
[56:46] that's again a privacy risk so yeah make
[56:49] sure that transaction are not too small
[56:52] um try avoid mixing too many different
[56:55] types of of coins and keep them in
[56:58] different sizes like spending sizes so
[57:00] if you expect to buy a car in next year
[57:05] then maybe it makes sense to have a
[57:07] transaction an utxo of like 02 Bitcoin
[57:11] because that would be 20K right so if
[57:14] you would spend that then it's almost
[57:16] reflects the value of what you're what
[57:17] you're
[57:18] buying um and then there's wallet
[57:21] software which which you can do properly
[57:23] do that right so uh yeah invest inof
[57:26] is to use software I would say
[57:29] absolutely and I just want to uh show
[57:32] people because I mentioned it
[57:34] before uh the this the the video that I
[57:38] made with Wicket Wicket you probably
[57:40] know uh from from Twitter uh and we went
[57:43] really yeah one hour nine minutes that
[57:47] that was in my old Studio still uh you
[57:49] can see there some some throwback
[57:51] content there just seven months ago um
[57:55] but yeah this is my my most detailed
[57:57] video on um utx o management we talk
[58:02] about how to avoid the yeah Bitcoin dust
[58:04] trrap that you just talked about that
[58:06] your Bitcoin becomes unpend but we also
[58:08] cover um I think like the half half of
[58:10] the videoos the Privacy aspect of it and
[58:12] also we went through the wallets and how
[58:14] to do it and and stuff like that uh and
[58:17] and really in-depth video 1 hour and 10
[58:19] minutes just about utx o management so
[58:22] that topic is is is is way more
[58:24] complicated uh and and Vince couldn't I
[58:29] explaining that in 10 minutes is is is
[58:31] very hard and you did a great job in
[58:33] that uh and and if people wantan to if
[58:36] people heard it now for the first time
[58:38] ever and and see like oh it's it's an
[58:39] important topic I think that video or
[58:41] like that hundreds of other videos
[58:44] outside of my channel uh that you can
[58:45] look at and dive deeper but it's
[58:48] important that you actually go ahead and
[58:50] say like oh I I I want
[58:53] to it's one of one of the steps to be
[58:55] self Sovereign uh self custody you take
[58:58] so management and and then further and
[59:01] further down the line with with privacy
[59:02] and all those things uh that's really
[59:04] cool anything uh you want to add here uh
[59:08] to the topic of of self- custody um Let
[59:10] me give it a quick thoughts I think we
[59:14] covered most of the
[59:15] um the topics um yeah like I said I
[59:20] would I would offer going to
[59:22] collaborative custody and then going to
[59:24] other options when you become
[59:26] interested I think another good option
[59:29] next to collaborative multi is assistant
[59:31] multi so there you would hold the
[59:33] majority of the keys but you still have
[59:35] a backup key uh with a key provider so
[59:38] in case something goes wrong you still
[59:40] have a third party um to go to and yeah
[59:44] really educate yourself on um on custody
[59:48] if and reconsider if this is something
[59:51] you want to do um or if you should um
[59:54] seek seek help
[59:56] um another thing is what I think is good
[59:58] to know is that there will be techn
[60:01] technological adventage in to in the
[60:03] future as well right so I think things
[60:06] will become easier so more people will
[60:08] custody um so let's let's see where it
[60:12] goes like things with with miniscript
[60:13] where you can do more techn
[60:15] technological things um I don't think we
[60:17] need to go into that call into that
[60:19] right
[60:20] now
[60:22] absolutely then um yeah third party risk
[60:26] management so if you think about
[60:29] inheritance or doing something with with
[60:31] a party always consider okay what does
[60:33] that party what does that mean right
[60:35] what are the risks there that's a very
[60:37] important important topic really cool
[60:40] thank you so much for that already um we
[60:42] have one question for each guest this is
[60:44] always the same question for each guest
[60:46] is what can we learn from you besides
[60:49] Bitcoin that's a good question I
[60:52] think it's most mostly about like die
[60:54] management
[60:56] so I think on if you start living on a
[60:59] Bitcoin standard you're going to be low
[61:01] time preference right so you're going to
[61:04] think okay what do I do now and what
[61:06] does it add for me um in the future I
[61:10] think some people go a bit too far with
[61:12] that right that we have the memes sell
[61:14] your chairs and everything so you still
[61:16] need to need to live so yeah sure stack
[61:20] as much Bitcoin as you can but also live
[61:23] live in an now spend time with your
[61:25] family and your friends do things that
[61:26] you love go outside exercise Etc finding
[61:29] that balance um it took me some time to
[61:32] uh to figure it out um in a previous job
[61:35] I worked a
[61:37] lot and it was too much so um and and
[61:41] you quickly fall into that trap right
[61:44] that's what a lot of people have and
[61:45] then suddenly the years have passed and
[61:48] I have a young kid so yeah spend spend
[61:51] time with each other that's I think one
[61:53] thing that's just very important then of
[61:56] course um keep
[61:58] learning right that's very important but
[62:01] mostly yeah your your time management
[62:03] make sure that the time is for you don't
[62:04] let others uh dedicate their time for
[62:07] you um only to the things that you think
[62:09] are important because there's so many
[62:11] things in life that need to happen and
[62:12] everybody always says that they're busy
[62:14] right it's kind of a yeah I'm busy yeah
[62:18] it's a bit pointless to say I would
[62:20] argue um we're all busy but are you
[62:22] doing the things that you love and
[62:24] spending the time the way that you like
[62:25] it
[62:27] guard your time with all you have it's
[62:29] it's really important that's uh learn to
[62:31] say no I learned this this year the hard
[62:35] way basically really cool thank you so
[62:37] much uh V for being on um we have end in
[62:41] the podcast where the previous guest is
[62:42] asking a question for the next guest
[62:44] without knowing who the next guest is we
[62:46] discussed it a little bit already um but
[62:49] I think it's uh not in that way what is
[62:51] the biggest barrier for Bitcoin as a
[62:54] form of payment
[62:58] that's a good question I think it will
[63:00] actually be
[63:01] governments because they want to control
[63:04] how we make payments who we make
[63:05] payments to um we we see I'm from the
[63:08] Netherlands the amount of cash that you
[63:10] can carry on on you is lowered the
[63:13] amount of cash that you can spend in a
[63:15] shop is lowered the amount of cash that
[63:16] you can hold at home is is
[63:19] lowered they want everything tied up
[63:22] into their system the same is what we
[63:25] see now with that travel rule they want
[63:27] to be able to follow the money and
[63:30] that's not what Bitcoin is forign was
[63:32] intended to do so I think that's the um
[63:36] I think that's really the the biggest
[63:37] risk I think the techn technological
[63:39] issues we will overcome um if there's a
[63:42] need for it right because it's very hard
[63:45] to build things for for a future when
[63:48] there's no need for it yet so scaling
[63:51] options will grow faster when the
[63:54] pressure is higher we saw that when
[63:57] onchain fees were very high people
[63:59] started uh adopting liquid and and
[64:02] lightning and putting it on their
[64:04] services more video tutorials came out
[64:07] on how to use these these ways of doing
[64:10] transactions and that will happen again
[64:12] when when transaction fees go up to1 and
[64:14] $1,000 and it will take some time before
[64:17] technological we are at the state that
[64:19] we wanted to be but the problem first
[64:21] needs to needs to really be there I
[64:23] guess um for people to invest their time
[64:25] into it so I think technologically will
[64:28] make it I'm more concerned about the uh
[64:30] regulatory overreach interesting um one
[64:33] follow-up question that uh the guest had
[64:36] pre-planned is Team Liquid or team
[64:40] lightning
[64:41] lightning very good I mean liquid I mean
[64:45] liquid is just another blockchain it's
[64:48] not Bitcoin sure you Peg your Bitcoin um
[64:53] there's a peg out from the Bitcoin
[64:54] blockchain and you're store your Bitcoin
[64:57] with uh the Federation from liquid yeah
[65:01] but it's not real Bitcoin anymore so for
[65:03] me it's just another shy chain just like
[65:06] others and yes I would use it because I
[65:08] trust the parties that are involved um
[65:10] but yeah lightning really cool perfect
