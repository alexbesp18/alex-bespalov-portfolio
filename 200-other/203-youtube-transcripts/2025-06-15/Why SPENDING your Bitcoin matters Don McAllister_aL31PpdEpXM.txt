[00:00] there's no way that we can just hold
[00:01] Bitcoin and not spend it we've got to
[00:03] use it's got to become a circular
[00:04] economy it's got to become part of the
[00:06] infrastructure people have got to become
[00:07] familiar with using Bitcoin rather than
[00:09] just storing it as a store of value
[00:10] instead of having a 100 million SATs you
[00:12] now have 1 million bits so a Bitcoin is
[00:14] a million bits and a bit is 100 satoshis
[00:17] instead of saying 100 SATs you'd say one
[00:19] bit or instead of saying 2,500 SATs
[00:21] you'd say 25 bits or if it was
[00:24] 2,599 SATs it'd be $25.99 you know it's
[00:27] it's just a more natural way you go to
[00:29] an exchange for instance and it's in
[00:30] Bitcoins you know not
[00:32] 0000000000 32 it's it's just crazy for
[00:35] people if it's 320,000 stats that blows
[00:38] the mind as well because people aren't
[00:39] used to hundreds of thousands in their
[00:41] monetary units as it becomes more
[00:42] widespread and people want to start
[00:44] using it more that I think that you know
[00:46] the capital gains element if not for
[00:47] your whole stack but for a portion of
[00:49] your stack will will need to be removed
[00:50] spending Bitcoin is really fun I mean
[00:52] using lightning is is incredible it's
[00:54] it's a fantastic technology I think we
[00:56] get a little bit too hung up about the
[00:58] self- sovereignty and uh the trustless
[01:00] side of things I I think over time we
[01:01] will need to start trusting Bitcoin
[01:04] [Music]
[01:07] Banks welcome theit podc SC yeah it's a
[01:11] bit strange for me actually I said I've
[01:12] done literally thousands of podcasts but
[01:14] it's all been Apple related because I
[01:15] used to have my own podcast my own Apple
[01:17] podcast I still I'm involved with that
[01:19] but I've guested on many many Apple
[01:20] related podcasts panel shows and stuff
[01:23] but this is the very first podcast where
[01:26] I've actually talked about Bitcoin so
[01:27] it's a bit strange for me this one yeah
[01:30] recently discovered that uh Apple
[01:32] actually invented podcasting like this
[01:34] the word podcast comes from Steve Jobs
[01:36] is is that right um not quite no it's
[01:40] actually Adam Curry Adam Curry and Dave
[01:42] wi with the original um podcasters uh
[01:47] and I think it was it wasn't actually um
[01:49] Adam Curry it was another guy who came
[01:51] up the term podcast but Apple in the
[01:53] very early days I mean they were great
[01:55] because they they really pushed
[01:56] podcasting and and they really were the
[01:58] ones who publicized it to a larg
[02:00] audience but no no um Steve Jobs didn't
[02:02] invent podcasting but he did a lot to
[02:03] help it in the early
[02:05] days I I was so confused because I saw a
[02:08] documentary with Steve Bobs like uh
[02:10] Steve Jobs was like IOD podcasting like
[02:14] he put I saw a speech where he put I was
[02:16] like did that Steve Jobs and Apple
[02:18] invented podcast and did actually the
[02:20] word still come from Apple it's
[02:22] interesting yeah it it still came from
[02:23] the iPod but it it was before Apple
[02:26] adopted I um before Apple actually
[02:29] adopted podcast themselves because when
[02:31] the when the iPod came on the scene it
[02:33] was seen as a great device to download
[02:35] content to and then uh Dave Wier and
[02:39] Adam Curry actually came up with the
[02:40] mechanism of RSS feeds and and how you
[02:43] would actually take a piece of content
[02:45] whether or not be audio or video
[02:47] whatever and actually broadcast that to
[02:49] a number of devices that would download
[02:50] in the background and would appear on
[02:52] your your iPod or on your Mac or on your
[02:54] PC so the name is coming from Apple from
[02:59] the iPod but the actual podcasting the
[03:01] method of it with the Aros s feeds this
[03:03] is actually coming from Adam Curry yeah
[03:06] Adam Curry and Dave W yeah yeah Adam was
[03:08] sort of like the ideas guy that's bit
[03:10] unfair actually they're both very good
[03:11] ideas guy but Dave Winer was the
[03:13] programmer uh and Adam was sort of like
[03:15] the the the promoter of it and came up
[03:17] with lots of the concepts as well so
[03:19] yeah we've got lot lot to thank Adam and
[03:21] dayve for actually I love it so much
[03:24] yeah I did not want to get in in this
[03:26] topic first but sure yeah
[03:30] definitely um I you have you wrote me
[03:33] three articles that you wrote also in in
[03:35] the Bitcoin magazine and the first one I
[03:37] I just want to get into that because
[03:39] it's always a discussion in in the
[03:41] Bitcoin sphere uh bits and SATs and you
[03:44] actually made the argument why bits is
[03:46] like better than than sat and using bit
[03:48] could promote
[03:49] Bitcoin yeah I I think it's um it's
[03:52] something that
[03:53] always it's a bit we have Marmite in the
[03:55] UK which is like a yeast extract product
[03:58] which you either love it or you hate it
[04:00] and I think with the thing with bits and
[04:01] SATs is people either love it love the
[04:03] idea of it or or hate it and just don't
[04:05] want anything to do with it and for
[04:07] people who aren't familiar with it it's
[04:08] it's B it's nothing new uh I mean bits
[04:10] is just a new way of it's not even a new
[04:13] way it's a way of
[04:15] uh determining the Nan never say that
[04:18] word anyway uh it's it's a way of
[04:20] splitting your Bitcoin so as you know
[04:22] you've got 100 million Satoshi in a
[04:24] Bitcoin or in a
[04:26] BTC and the bit really is like a de
[04:29] decibel repes representation of that so
[04:31] instead of having a 100 million SATs you
[04:33] now you now have 1 million bits so a
[04:36] Bitcoin is a million bits and a bit is
[04:39] 100
[04:39] satoshis uh so you know instead of
[04:42] saying uh instead of saying 100 SATs
[04:44] you'd say one bit or instead of saying
[04:46] 2,500 SATs you'd say 25 bits or if it
[04:49] was
[04:50] 2,599 SATs it'd be 25.99 you know it's
[04:54] it's just a more natural way uh
[04:56] especially not so much for those people
[04:58] already familiar with Bitcoin but for
[05:00] for new people into the space you know
[05:02] this concept of a 100 million units is
[05:05] is just completely alien to them and
[05:07] also and I can understand why we went
[05:10] with SATs because you know when Bitcoin
[05:11] was very low value uh you had to use
[05:14] multiples of SATs to you you know to to
[05:16] sort of equate the value to a sensible
[05:19] figure but as Bitcoin increases in value
[05:21] um I I think the the move to a bits
[05:24] standard rather than a SAT standard is
[05:27] is probably going to be more easily
[05:28] adopted by people who who aren't into
[05:30] Bitcoin at the moment which is let's
[05:31] face it it's the bulk of people at the
[05:33] moment you know not everybody is
[05:34] although they've had of Bitcoin as soon
[05:36] as you introduce bits as soon as you
[05:38] introduce SATs to the equation people
[05:40] sort of it blows their mind a bit um but
[05:43] you know the the old bitcoiners uh get a
[05:45] bit upset because they think we're
[05:46] trying to replace SATs or this is
[05:49] something new um but bits actually were
[05:51] are actually included in the original
[05:53] white paper I think and also you know
[05:55] the the word sat and I know a lot of
[05:57] people sort of said well it's it's a
[05:58] homage to Su Satoshi he never actually
[06:01] named them SATs uh they would that came
[06:03] on later so you know and we're not
[06:05] getting rid of SATs no one's talking
[06:06] about getting rid of SATs we just saying
[06:08] have bits and SATs so one bit is 100
[06:11] SATs and it's equivalent to $1 is 100
[06:14] cents one pound is 100 P um you know one
[06:18] euro is a 100 EUR cents it's just a more
[06:21] natural way for people who are not
[06:23] familiar with the concept to sort of get
[06:25] the head round you know how it how it
[06:27] would actually work for them and of
[06:29] course plus when we do reach one million
[06:31] uh the equivalent of a million dollars
[06:33] uh per Bitcoin uh one bit would then be
[06:36] the equivalent of a dollar and one sat
[06:39] would be the equivalent of a scent so
[06:40] you know it's it ju it just seems more
[06:42] sensible but people get very upset and
[06:45] very uh protective of of SATs but no not
[06:48] trying to do away with SATs whatsoever
[06:50] and I think we need more than SATs
[06:52] anyways I think we need under and
[06:53] overset like when we have actually like
[06:56] look really far out then we need those
[06:58] things I think there are m cense i mean
[07:01] it's just a matter of moving the decimal
[07:02] points that's all we're doing there's no
[07:04] there's no huge rewrite of Bitcoin
[07:05] required there's no uh new technology
[07:08] it's literally just moving the decimal
[07:10] points and again this I think both halin
[07:12] and also uh Satoshi themselves or
[07:15] whoever it was uh also mentioned that at
[07:17] some point in time as the value of
[07:18] Bitcoin would increase we would need to
[07:20] to move the decimal point around to make
[07:22] it more viable for people to understand
[07:25] yeah especially when we move in the area
[07:27] where we actually spend Bitcoin because
[07:29] as long as we we have it just as a store
[07:30] of value and not of a unifit of count it
[07:32] doesn't really matter what we call it
[07:34] but when you want to have like prices
[07:36] and that's the supermarket and unit of
[07:38] account then kind of need like oh it's
[07:40] like oh I I buy a banana it's like two
[07:44] micro SATs or whatever
[07:47] yeah yeah yeah it's it's you know as as
[07:49] we get more into the using as a as a an
[07:52] exchange mechanism I think you know
[07:54] probably be more sensible then it's also
[07:56] easier to um to register in your head I
[08:00] mean if you go on an app if you go to an
[08:02] exchange app for instance and it's in
[08:04] Bitcoins you know note
[08:06] 000000000000 32 yeah it's it's just
[08:09] crazy for people um and and you know if
[08:12] it's 320,000 stats that blows the mind
[08:15] as well because people aren't used to
[08:16] hundreds of thousands in their monetary
[08:18] units um so you know just a decimal
[08:21] system just appears to me to be more
[08:22] sensible and this unit bias actually
[08:25] annoys me a lot like the the the people
[08:27] like oh one Bitcoin is so expensive if I
[08:29] cannot afford this it's the same thing
[08:31] why all the companies are doing stock
[08:33] splits when it gets up to a certain
[08:35] extent because you can now with the
[08:36] modern exchanges you can buy like half
[08:38] Apple stock that's not a problem it's at
[08:40] this point it's just like an an unit buy
[08:42] like oh but they they don't look at the
[08:44] whole thing they look at one piece and
[08:46] they're like if bitcoin price now would
[08:48] be differently divided and would be like
[08:50] now I don't know 1,000 EUR or like maybe
[08:52] like one yearo people were like yeah
[08:54] yeah I can buy two Euro uh two Bitcoins
[08:56] of that so the unit buyers is like
[08:58] annoys me a little bit
[09:00] it do and a lot of people have said that
[09:02] that's one of the reasons why people get
[09:03] into altcoins because they do perceive
[09:05] Bitcoin to be so expensive you know if
[09:07] they go into a you know exchange for the
[09:09] shitcoins and they see Bitcoin at
[09:12] $60,000 and yet they see something else
[09:14] which is like you know $10 oh well I'll
[09:16] have a hundred of those rather than you
[09:18] know
[09:19] 0.000000001 you know of a Bitcoin it
[09:22] just totally confuses people so it is in
[09:26] effect like a stock split yeah and and
[09:28] this fortunately Finance has a lot to do
[09:31] with psychology it has that definitely
[09:35] plays into the role but you also made
[09:36] the argument that uh we we should spend
[09:39] our Bitcoin um to draft adoption like
[09:43] you made some some article about that
[09:44] like why we need to spend
[09:48] Bitcoin yeah I mean it's it's great
[09:50] having as a store of value and you know
[09:52] people always say well if it's going to
[09:53] go up so much over time why on Earth
[09:56] would I actually spend it you know
[09:57] because it's crazy I may as well just
[09:59] keep hold of it but the fact of the
[10:00] matter and the fact of life is you have
[10:02] to spend money every week you have to
[10:04] spend money every day um so there's no
[10:07] reason why you know you shouldn't uh
[10:11] exchange Bitcoin just in that week to
[10:14] spend for that week because you're going
[10:15] to spend you're going to spend say you
[10:17] spend $1,000 in a month
[10:20] um you you know you're actually going to
[10:22] spend $1,000 it doesn't matter if it's
[10:24] in Bitcoin or if it's in dollars why not
[10:26] exchange it into Bitcoin and then spend
[10:28] the Bitcoin if we have the the you know
[10:30] the ways to spend it uh there's no way
[10:32] that we can just hold Bitcoin and not
[10:34] spend it we we've got to use it's got to
[10:36] become a circular economy it's got to
[10:37] become part of the infrastructure people
[10:39] have got to become familiar with using
[10:41] Bitcoin rather than just storing it as a
[10:42] store of value but do you think uh keeps
[10:45] bitco keeps bitcoiners to hold it when
[10:48] we see all the onch analysis uh like
[10:50] most people like actually just hold onto
[10:52] it that's such a big percentage of
[10:54] Bitcoin that's like they they did not
[10:56] move since a year they did not move
[10:57] since five years
[10:59] yeah yeah well I think one of the issues
[11:01] is that it's been difficult to spend
[11:03] Bitcoin to be honest uh which is why we
[11:05] need to be able to start spending
[11:06] Bitcoin and that would then improve the
[11:09] distribution because we have got an
[11:11] issue with the distribution of Bitcoin
[11:12] at the moment in that but it is sort
[11:14] itself out you know we've got all the
[11:16] people who bought in when it was $10 a
[11:18] Bitcoin and they probably bought
[11:20] hundreds if not thousands of Bitcoins
[11:22] and then when it went up to $100 or $
[11:24] thousand dollar well they then sort of
[11:26] skimm some off the top and then some of
[11:28] that got distributed and then those
[11:29] people that bought at $1,000 when it
[11:31] went to
[11:32] $10,000 they they then sold some of
[11:34] theirs off at the top and it just this
[11:35] is this is the way that the Bitcoin
[11:37] actually gets spread and diffused
[11:39] amongst the population and we've still
[11:40] got a long way to go um but you know I I
[11:44] we're not saying that you should spend
[11:45] all of your Bitcoin on something you
[11:47] know uh hold your main stack but then at
[11:50] when the right time comes either use
[11:53] some of it to for your day-to-day
[11:55] outgoings or if you have a major
[11:56] purchase that you definitely want well
[11:58] you know just take some profit of at
[11:59] that point and that's when we get into
[12:00] the circular economy again I think one
[12:03] uh one big point is also that uh people
[12:06] that actually want to spend Bitcoin uh
[12:08] they rather spend the the Fiat
[12:09] currencies because they have tax
[12:11] implications when they spend their the
[12:13] Bitcoin that's at least why I do it
[12:14] because I'm like I'm all in Bitcoin
[12:16] anyways I would love to just like ditch
[12:19] a feeld and have all in Bitcoin and and
[12:21] spend Bitcoin uh like the one problem is
[12:23] like I cannot really spend it like I
[12:26] have to argue with my landlord for the
[12:27] rent I have to argue at the grocery
[12:30] store find some other Solutions uh and
[12:32] then also I have to report taxes on that
[12:34] if I buy something for 2,000 euros and I
[12:37] made like a thousand profits on that I
[12:39] have to additionally spend like2 200 EUR
[12:41] for for taxes on that I know that that
[12:44] is a problem that and fees as well you
[12:46] know um we want we at the moment to to
[12:50] buy a small amount of Bitcoin to use as
[12:52] your weekly spend you know you normally
[12:54] do in Cur fees so that's an issue as
[12:55] well um but the the tax thing is
[12:58] problematic and I think eventually as it
[13:00] becomes more widespread and people want
[13:02] to start using it more that I think that
[13:04] you know the capital gains element um if
[13:07] not for your whole stack but for a
[13:08] portion of your stack will will need to
[13:10] be removed either by it becoming a
[13:12] legitimate currency because we don't we
[13:13] don't have capital gains on currency now
[13:15] uh and Bitcoin is a currency So
[13:17] eventually one would hope there'll be
[13:19] legislation that will take away the
[13:20] capital gain side of things and that
[13:22] would free up people to to be able to
[13:24] use it and besides which spending
[13:26] Bitcoin is really fun I mean using
[13:28] lightning is is incredible it's it's
[13:30] it's it's a a fantastic technology and
[13:33] we're not talking on chain here we're
[13:34] talking know instant lightning payments
[13:36] from from one person to another or to a
[13:38] vendor um I just love using lightning
[13:40] wallets to uh to spend $10 here or you
[13:43] know couple couple of SATs or a couple
[13:45] bits here and there it's it's it's just
[13:47] it's actually really fun to do I I quite
[13:49] enjoy it yeah me too I tried it uh with
[13:54] the Bitcoin conferences I always do it
[13:55] because there you can spend and you need
[13:57] anyway something because they're like
[13:59] small cakes like water and then you need
[14:02] to spend something to to get the water
[14:03] and yeah let's let's do it with Sates
[14:05] and I also have all like at least $50 in
[14:08] in my lightning wallet to like to spend
[14:11] something even last time I was in a
[14:12] restaurant with a a friend and they only
[14:15] uh took cash and I did not have cash
[14:17] with me and so he uh paid for me and
[14:20] then I I gave him with a lightning
[14:22] wallet the the my share of of of the of
[14:25] of the coffee and it was really cool
[14:27] because it was like this cash moment
[14:29] where like ah we just exchanges
[14:31] Lightnings on and we exchanged Bitcoin
[14:33] directly yeah well I was fortunate
[14:34] enough to go to bitcoin Atlantis in
[14:36] Madera and uh that that was the first
[14:38] time really where every single vendor
[14:40] that was there was actually set up for
[14:42] for Bitcoin which was terrific you know
[14:44] they all had lightning terminals um they
[14:47] also had the Bitcoin cards that you
[14:49] could load up with uh with SATs as well
[14:51] so you could use that for payment um I I
[14:53] used probably half a dozen different
[14:56] wallets to test them out proper you know
[14:57] in a live environment and they all we
[14:59] seamlessly I even have um I've got a
[15:01] full node of course and I've I've got a
[15:03] lightning node on my full node at home
[15:06] and I use tail scale to communicate with
[15:09] Zeus on my iPhone and even in mad I was
[15:12] able to use my own lightning node back
[15:13] at home to to pay for beers and for
[15:16] pastries and coffees and stuff and it
[15:18] just worked seamlessly it was really
[15:19] really good how was mad unfortunately
[15:23] could not go but uh saw so many great uh
[15:25] things from there that I was like ah
[15:27]  I should have gone
[15:30] yeah yeah yeah I mean I I love mad
[15:32] anyway because we've holidayed there
[15:33] many many times so I know it well so the
[15:35] fact that there was a a Bitcoin
[15:37] conference and madira rolled in one
[15:38] package uh I sort of couldn't say no but
[15:41] the conference itself was it was pretty
[15:43] spectacular to be honest considering
[15:45] that they put it together in such a
[15:47] short time um it was just incredible
[15:50] lineup of speakers were great uh the the
[15:53] actual conference venue it was in a
[15:54] football stadium so it was really
[15:55] unusual in that the the stage was on the
[15:57] pitch we were in the stand and then
[15:59] around The Concourse of the of the of
[16:01] the Arena they had lots of uh food
[16:04] stands uh they had art installations
[16:07] they had a a book thing where auth could
[16:10] go to sign the books they had a kids
[16:11] place and they had um an open source
[16:14] stage as well so it it was fantastic
[16:16] actually it was very very well put
[16:18] together and well worth the trip out
[16:20] there yeah I encourage all those people
[16:22] to like if they are in Bitcoin even if
[16:24] they don't want to work in Bitcoin or
[16:25] stuff like that go to a conference meet
[16:27] other bitcoiners or go go to a local
[16:29] meet up or go to some something where
[16:31] you actually meet uh Bitcoin as in real
[16:33] life it changes how you view Bitcoin and
[16:36] it actually makes this thing way more
[16:38] real when you go to the Bitcoin
[16:39] conference and you see the Expo area
[16:41] where all the great companies are there
[16:43] I always uh encourage people that I
[16:45] actually see oh Bitcoin is an actual
[16:47] industry where people work in where
[16:48] people do something and it's it's
[16:50] something something really nice it's
[16:52] something it's good to support them as
[16:54] well you know they they put all that
[16:55] effort into putting it together so it's
[16:57] really good to uh to attend and
[17:00] support absolutely absolutely and what
[17:03] is from for you the the what was the
[17:06] moment for you when Bitcoin clicked like
[17:07] when you got like oh Bitcoin could
[17:10] be something could could be more than
[17:12] just like some some
[17:15] fed yeah I mean it's going back a while
[17:17] now I can't remember the exact thing uh
[17:20] I mean I actually went back many many
[17:21] years I think it was
[17:23] 2011 I think possibly the first time I
[17:25] heard of it um in my previous existence
[17:28] I was presenter uh i r a screencast I
[17:31] think called screencast online which is
[17:33] like a Mac tutorial Service uh it's
[17:35] still in existence but I just provide
[17:36] content now um uh one of the presenters
[17:39] has taken over for for me but as part of
[17:41] that I actually used to speak on ships
[17:44] we used to do
[17:46] cruises uh I think called macmania and
[17:49] back in uh 2011 I think it was we we
[17:52] went on a cruise and one of the
[17:53] presenters there um actually gave us um
[17:56] a talk about Bitcoin and I think Bitcoin
[17:58] at the time was around about $10 $20
[18:01] something like that it was really you
[18:03] know quite interesting but uh he sort of
[18:06] told us to go away and um you know Buy
[18:09] $100 worth of bitcoin it was too
[18:11] difficult at that time because we
[18:12] couldn't actually it wasn't easy to buy
[18:15] so I sort of left it then until I think
[18:17] around about 2017 when that's when I
[18:19] started to get back interested in it
[18:20] again it had gone up to probably around
[18:22] about s or 8,000 per Bitcoin and I
[18:25] completely just blanked it out for the
[18:26] you know between those six years didn't
[18:29] understand it didn't know what was going
[18:30] on with it um but I just it just it just
[18:32] came I don't know how but it came to my
[18:35] attention and I got really interested in
[18:37] it and because I was doing these Mac
[18:39] tutorials um which just wasn't about Mac
[18:43] and apple stuff I wanted to cover
[18:44] technology as well I actually did a
[18:46] couple of shows about Bitcoin at the
[18:48] time and that that caused me the thing
[18:50] is when you when you're creating videos
[18:52] for people yeah tutorials you learn more
[18:54] Yourself by preparing for them so I I
[18:57] created two tutorials about Bitcoin back
[18:59] in 2017 and um you know I was fascinated
[19:03] to to uh not just the monetary value but
[19:05] all the other aspects surrounding it as
[19:06] well you know the social impact not so
[19:08] much the environmental at the time
[19:10] because that's only really recently when
[19:11] the environmental benefits have started
[19:13] to to proliferate but um yeah so so it
[19:16] was around about 2017 I just became
[19:18] really really interested and um and that
[19:21] was it really I you know I've been deep
[19:23] down the rabbit hole ever
[19:25] since I wonder because um you said 2017
[19:29] I also see that most people come in in
[19:31] the Peaks when like the price went up
[19:33] like 2017 was a big Point 2021 and 20120
[19:37] was a big Point like whenever the price
[19:38] moves a lot uh I think that's that's
[19:41] that's the best marketing tool still for
[19:43] for it's really strange yeah CU because
[19:46] when I when I started to plan the video
[19:47] out I think it was about 7,000 uh
[19:50] because it only took took me like two or
[19:51] three weeks to to plan the video and
[19:53] then to record it and to publish it uh
[19:55] so I I did the first video and I think
[19:57] it was when I started it was about
[20:00] 7,000 and then so I wrote my script and
[20:03] everything was starting to record it and
[20:04] then by the time I'd finished recording
[20:05] it had gone up to
[20:06] 9,000 so I thought well this is weird
[20:08] and then I planned the second show to
[20:10] follow a couple of weeks after and then
[20:12] it gone up to 10 or 11,000 so in the
[20:14] space of those four months it had jumped
[20:16] up by about you know $4,000 and but I
[20:18] was I I was really careful
[20:21] because I I didn't want to push it as a
[20:23] as an investment or as a savings
[20:25] technology I wanted to push it as a
[20:27] technology that people should be
[20:28] interested or should be aware of so I I
[20:31] really downplayed or I tried to downplay
[20:33] the fact that it was it was actually
[20:34] going up in value um so you know I
[20:38] really took it from the angle of what
[20:39] the technology was how it worked what it
[20:41] was what its benefits were you know so
[20:43] the some of the use cases and stuff like
[20:45] that but all the time as I'm preparing
[20:47] these shows the price is going up and I
[20:48] had to reflect that in the show as well
[20:50] so it was a it was it was a bit strange
[20:52] bit bit weird what was the exciting
[20:55] thing about technology outside of being
[20:57] a store Val outside of being a was it
[21:00] the payment methods so yeah I think it
[21:02] was the decentralized aspect of it and
[21:04] the fact that it was sort of like um an
[21:06] enclosed ecosystem that sort of ran
[21:08] itself you know there were no middlemen
[21:10] and it just worked basically um you know
[21:13] it been up for such a long time at that
[21:15] time U with very little downtime um I
[21:19] just found it really fascinating to you
[21:21] know H how a money could exist with
[21:23] because you know we're all familiar with
[21:24] central banks Etc in the current Fiat
[21:26] system um you know how how this could
[21:28] operate independently uh just based
[21:31] based on maths and code and you know it
[21:34] seemed like magic really you know it
[21:35] seemed and again I think this is one of
[21:37] the reasons why people have difficulty
[21:39] in adopting Bitcoin because it does seem
[21:41] too good to be true um not just the
[21:43] number go up technology but the fact
[21:45] that you know I know there are
[21:47] maintainers and stuff and you know the
[21:48] code does get updated uh but pretty much
[21:51] it just runs itself and um you know and
[21:54] it has done for quite a while and we've
[21:55] never had touch with any any major major
[21:58] outages it's uh it's pretty spectacular
[22:00] really yeah I Al love of the memes every
[22:03] time like Facebook or YouTube or
[22:05] something like that is down the memes
[22:07] like oh Bitcoin is still up or even in
[22:09] the in the weekends when like the banks
[22:11] are closed and yeah Bitcoin is still
[22:13] there you can still still use it I love
[22:15] those those memes is the what do you see
[22:18] as the the most important aspect is it
[22:20] is the decentral decentralization of of
[22:23] Bitcoin the most important for
[22:25] you um yeah I think it's it's the lack
[22:29] of Reliance on third parties I think
[22:31] that's the most uh significant thing for
[22:33] me the fact that you can become self-
[22:35] sovereign um I mean I was listening to
[22:37] your episode with sailor um a couple of
[22:39] weeks ago and you know it was a great
[22:40] episode and I I do Echo his feelings I
[22:43] think we get a little bit too hung up
[22:45] about this self- sovereignty and uh the
[22:47] trustless side of things I I think over
[22:49] time we will need to start trusting
[22:52] Bitcoin Banks or or or or people who
[22:54] will help people on board Bitcoin more
[22:57] um but the fact that you you can be
[22:59] self- Sovereign if you want um is is
[23:01] quite a you know it's quite an
[23:04] incredible thing really um and just have
[23:05] complete ownership of the asset no one
[23:07] can take it away from you um it's it's
[23:10] it's the way it's been engineered is is
[23:12] quite significant does trust thing is is
[23:15] really important because people don't
[23:17] get it um we we always have to trust any
[23:20] something like I I trust that when I
[23:23] bring my garbage down that once a week
[23:25] the garbage is taken out and and they
[23:27] they do something with I trust this
[23:30] chair that it does not fall apart and
[23:31] that he he did a great job like we trust
[23:33] in our lives so many people and so many
[23:36] objects and so many things along the way
[23:38] even like hard wallet uh devices and you
[23:41] have to trust them that they don't have
[23:43] anything weird on there you have to
[23:45] trust the the parcel that there's
[23:47] nothing manipulated so it's always trust
[23:50] involved uh so um when when people get
[23:53] like oh there are Bitcoin Banks and
[23:55] stuff like that of course people some
[23:57] people trust the third part party uh to
[23:59] take their keys more than they they
[24:01] trust themselves because they're like ah
[24:03] I just want to have have that and also
[24:05] salor point about when you have like a
[24:08] big company with like millions and
[24:10] millions of dollars you don't want to go
[24:12] out on the Visa like oh yeah I hold all
[24:14] the keys please kill me yeah exactly
[24:17] yeah yeah yeah and people I mean let's
[24:19] face it you know not everybody's going
[24:21] to run their own node it's it's just not
[24:23] going to happen um you know and also not
[24:26] everyone's going to be able to hold
[24:27] their own keys um again either from a
[24:30] technical standpoint or from the fact
[24:31] that they don't want to because you know
[24:34] they they just don't want the
[24:35] responsibility I mean there are great
[24:37] Solutions great multisig solutions that
[24:39] people can buy into but um you know it
[24:42] does take a little bit of not a lot but
[24:44] a little bit of tech savvy you know um
[24:46] and these will become more simple over
[24:47] time but but people just don't want to
[24:49] do that so I think we we need to
[24:51] appreciate that and um I think we'll see
[24:54] more and more services that will will
[24:56] help will onboard people uh in more
[24:58] simpler fashion um but we we will need
[25:01] to have some level of trust um moving
[25:04] forward and I see a lot of different
[25:06] options with self custody and I have a
[25:08] little bit of a problem maybe you can uh
[25:11] give some feedback here but uh when I
[25:13] see uh the internet adoption uh like in
[25:16] the beginning when I see emails a lot of
[25:18] people said back then I was not I was
[25:21] not there because I'm too young for that
[25:23] but in the beginning of email people
[25:24] said like oh everyone will run their own
[25:26] email servers now everything is on Gmail
[25:29] um then like how many people could
[25:31] actually um put together an email and
[25:33] send it and understand like oh okay it
[25:35] goes there and then what to do I do with
[25:37] the tech now my grandma is on WhatsApp I
[25:39] can write her on WhatsApp so like the
[25:42] the thing got way easier uh and we and
[25:47] and everyone can do it now is self custy
[25:49] something that will be so easy that
[25:51] almost everyone will do it or will it
[25:53] always be like a niche thing and where
[25:56] uh Banks and third parties will will
[25:58] take care of it um yeah I no I do think
[26:01] it's it will be an N thing take s
[26:02] custody uh although it will become
[26:04] easier over time and the option will be
[26:05] there for people who want to do it but
[26:07] it's interesting you mention email
[26:08] because I mean I I was there
[26:09] unfortunately you know I I was there
[26:11] when the email first came out you know
[26:13] um I was I was here before you know PCS
[26:15] and computers came out so you know I was
[26:17] there to see what happened the really
[26:19] interesting thing about email and and
[26:21] the the comparison is that um we sort of
[26:25] had email in Internet and stuff um and
[26:28] we could we could communicate with our
[26:30] own people you know on our local
[26:32] internets and stuff using email and then
[26:34] suddenly literally overnight at least it
[26:36] felt to me overnight suddenly the the
[26:38] global network was there of emails and
[26:40] it literally happened so quickly uh
[26:43] literally within what felt like the
[26:45] blink of an eye you went from having you
[26:47] know internet to a Global Network and I
[26:50] think we're probably going to see
[26:51] something similar with with Bitcoin you
[26:53] know at the moment we we've we've got
[26:55] Niche people we we we've got people who
[26:57] are really understand understand it but
[26:59] it's not really there for everybody but
[27:01] I think um although it you know it will
[27:03] probably feel a bit longer than the
[27:04] blink of an eye but over the space of
[27:05] six months or something we we'll
[27:07] probably see a shift from the current
[27:09] system to you know a worldwide adoption
[27:12] of Bitcoin really really quickly a lot
[27:14] quicker than people
[27:16] um are thinking of in the same way that
[27:19] we saw that with email you know it
[27:20] probably took six months to a year for
[27:22] the email to to sort of spread itself
[27:24] out globally but at the time it it
[27:27] seemed really really quick and I'm sort
[27:29] of anticipating we we'll sort of have a
[27:31] similar feeling when we look back at you
[27:33] know when when Bitcoin became uh a mass
[27:36] medium of adoption or or you know the
[27:37] mass mass people adopted it that it
[27:39] happened really really
[27:41] quickly do you see the internet adoption
[27:44] email adoption uh right now when we see
[27:48] like Bitcoin is now at a similar stage
[27:50] where internet and and and this adoption
[27:52] was like
[27:53] 1992
[27:55] 57 do you see like this
[27:58] boom still coming that we had in the
[28:01] 2000s uh no not really I mean I still
[28:03] see sort of you know the the parallel to
[28:06] to bitcoin adoption is you know at the
[28:08] time when all those hardened nerds had
[28:10] dial up modems and stuff you know were
[28:12] logging into bulletin boards and stuff
[28:14] it's it's it feels as though it's that
[28:15] sort of thing perhaps a bit further on
[28:17] than that because there are so many uh
[28:19] companies involved in it now but uh I
[28:21] still think we're in the very very early
[28:23] days of mass adoption um and things will
[28:25] change significantly once uh you know
[28:27] the the the big players get
[28:30] involved I love it a lot and one topic
[28:33] that I also wanted to cover with you
[28:34] because you started a podcast and we
[28:36] talked a little bit before that um when
[28:39] you you were in an IT career and then
[28:41] you started as a hobby a podcast and
[28:44] then you actually made it a business out
[28:45] of that which sounds very familiar
[28:47] because I was also in an IT job then I
[28:49] started a podcast hobby then I actually
[28:51] oh was was there like oh I could make
[28:53] actually money from that and I can
[28:54] actually live on that then I quit that
[28:57] um when was the the moment for you when
[28:59] you realized this this Hoy podcasting
[29:02] could actually pay your
[29:04] bills yeah well I I I originally I
[29:06] started off with the idea of doing a a
[29:08] Mac podcast but like an audio podcast um
[29:12] and then I bought the gear I bought the
[29:14] microphone I bought a domain name even
[29:16] you know had it all set up and I sat
[29:17] down in front of the mic and thought you
[29:20] know what am I going to talk about you
[29:22] know there wasn't you know I sort of so
[29:24] sort of went back to the drawing board
[29:26] and um at the time
[29:28] uh I was quite new to the MAC at the
[29:30] time I was I've been a PC guy for most
[29:32] of my it career but it was only uh sort
[29:35] of like 2004 I think it was when I moved
[29:37] across to the mac and I was really
[29:39] enthusiastic enthusiastic about it and I
[29:42] was evangelizing to my friends and
[29:44] family Etc and then one of my one of my
[29:47] uh family members actually bought a Mac
[29:48] and I needed to show her how to use it
[29:50] because she didn't live near me so I
[29:51] started making these screencasts these
[29:53] video um which I did the narration on to
[29:56] to walk through how to use the mac and
[29:57] how to use apps and stuff and then I
[29:59] realized that you know it's a video um
[30:01] with RSS you can deliver video as well
[30:04] as audio in a podcast so I set up one of
[30:06] the first video podcasts uh this is
[30:08] before YouTube um and I would deliver
[30:10] the content via RSS and then it was
[30:13] completely free service just a hobby I
[30:15] did the weekend and then I thought and I
[30:17] was getting a lots of people actually
[30:18] contact me saying you know we really
[30:19] love the videos and they're really
[30:20] helpful so can we donate can we you know
[30:23] give you some cash to help out with the
[30:25] hosting and bandwidth Etc at the time
[30:27] bandwidth was quite expensive especially
[30:29] for video and then that sort of you know
[30:31] said oh perhaps if I do some more videos
[30:34] or perhaps exclusive videos for people
[30:36] who want to pay for them So eventually I
[30:38] went from doing like four videos four
[30:40] free videos a month to three videos
[30:43] which were free and then one which was a
[30:44] a premium video and I set up a
[30:46] membership site and so people could
[30:48] become members and then over the years
[30:50] it sort of went to two three videos to
[30:52] two paid videos then three paid video So
[30:54] eventually I sort of built up an
[30:55] audience and um eventually it was a a a
[30:58] membership site which we deliver two
[31:00] videos each week to uh paying members
[31:03] but also creating some free content as
[31:05] well and that was that was how I was
[31:07] able to monetize it over time really
[31:09] thank you you already made it halfway
[31:11] through the video and I'm really really
[31:13] grateful to have you here two things
[31:15] make this channel possible you as a
[31:18] watcher and listener who keep supporting
[31:20] this Channel and another one is all the
[31:22] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[31:25] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[31:27] very start and where I personally buy my
[31:29] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[31:31] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[31:33] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[31:37] simplest and securest way to secure your
[31:40] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[31:42] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[31:45] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[31:47] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[31:51] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[31:53] and you know your friend does not have
[31:55] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[31:57] he needs a the present and a small life
[31:59] hack if you use code Robin you get 5%
[32:02] off your order plus you support my
[32:05] channel and now let's get back to the
[32:07] video so this was 20056 before YouTube
[32:10] yeah I started as a hobby in 2005 and
[32:12] then 2006 uh we launched it as
[32:15] screencast online which is the
[32:16] membership the membership system still
[32:19] going to this day I'm glad to
[32:21] say amazing I love it a lot uh yeah also
[32:25] my podcast I want to run this all my
[32:27] life I I don't want to stop it anytime
[32:29] soon it's just fun to have conversations
[32:32] it's it's fascinating that I can
[32:33] actually live on that but but even if I
[32:36] could not uh then I would have not do it
[32:38] every day I would maybe do it once a
[32:39] week or twice a week uh because it's
[32:42] quite easy actually to operate it like
[32:43] all this the things that you had to do
[32:45] for me it's like yeah yeah well well
[32:48] when I started of course we didn't have
[32:49] the tools then so when I started I I did
[32:51] the website I did the you know all the
[32:53] advertising but we didn't do advertising
[32:55] we still don't really it's all
[32:56] membership subscriptions so so I did it
[32:58] was basically a oneman band uh and then
[33:00] over time um you know uh I brought in
[33:03] extra presenters uh people to help with
[33:05] the production side of stuff um and then
[33:08] probably for the past four or five years
[33:10] I've sort of gradually started to step
[33:12] back I still produce content for the
[33:13] show but I was managing the show and
[33:15] managing um you know the business side
[33:17] of it um so now I've reached the grand
[33:19] old age of 65 I decided it was time to
[33:22] step back a little bit further so I've
[33:23] sold the business to I say Lee who's one
[33:26] of the presenters that's been with us
[33:27] for years
[33:28] uh and I now just create content so I'll
[33:30] create articles for our magazine and
[33:31] I'll create videos um on a slightly
[33:34] slightly reduced rate than I have done
[33:35] before but it's the best of both worlds
[33:37] I don't have the worry of or the stress
[33:39] of running a business but I do get to
[33:41] create the content and I can free myself
[33:43] up for other interests such as you know
[33:45] Bitcoin or um whatever I want to do now
[33:47] so I'm sort of fortunate in that way in
[33:50] that uh I've sort of semi-retired and
[33:52] Bitcoin has played a part of that as
[33:54] well because obviously I've been I've
[33:55] been stacking uh I have a standard
[33:58] pension as well but it's nice to have
[33:59] the um the peace of mind that I've also
[34:03] got not just my sort of standard pension
[34:05] but I will also have a a Bitcoin stack
[34:08] as well which hopefully will grow over
[34:10] time and uh you know help me out in my
[34:11] in my future
[34:13] retirement if it would be now 25 would
[34:16] you take Bitcoin as like your your
[34:18] pension plan as oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
[34:21] oh yeah any day yeah and and the problem
[34:22] is we we can't uh here in the UK uh the
[34:25] only way that you can actually have any
[34:28] Bitcoin exposure in your pension plan um
[34:30] is to basically follow the root of of
[34:33] getting micro strategy um you know
[34:35] adopting micro strategy shares in your
[34:37] pension so you can do that here in the
[34:39] UK um I actually did have a a pension
[34:42] with a one prent pension provider who
[34:44] wouldn't allow me to do that so I
[34:46] actually move my pension uh into what's
[34:48] called a sip which is a self-invested
[34:50] pension plan so now I've got free full
[34:52] control over what I can invest my
[34:54] pension in and you know I've actually
[34:56] taken some steps to invest in my
[34:57] strategy and uh some other stocks and
[34:59] shares that I think are going to be uh
[35:01] good but um yeah we got we can't have a
[35:04] whole pension I know in Australia that's
[35:06] possible that you can actually um put
[35:08] your pension into Bitcoin uh so at the
[35:11] moment now I have a separate Bitcoin
[35:12] stack and then I have my traditional
[35:15] pension but I have got exposure to
[35:17] Bitcoin in there through micro strategy
[35:19] um and also like we have a thing called
[35:21] an Isa which is a taxfree rapper it's
[35:23] not a pension but you it's like a
[35:25] savings plan and again you can invest in
[35:27] stock and shares and again I've I've got
[35:29] some exposure to Bitcoin in my Isa by
[35:32] investing in micro strategy and a couple
[35:34] of the other Bitcoin companies a couple
[35:36] of Bitcoin Miners and stuff like that so
[35:38] I am exposed although I haven't actually
[35:39] got actual Bitcoin of course in the UK
[35:42] uh we we can't have access to the
[35:44] Bitcoin ETFs um just because of our
[35:48] Draconian Financial rules don't allow us
[35:50] to do that so you know the only option
[35:52] is to go down down the micro strategy
[35:54] route if you do want to expose you to
[35:55] Bitcoin in in traditional finan IAL
[35:58] rappers yeah it was a it was a massive
[36:01] move for Michael saor to do that because
[36:03] I know a lot of people who have Micro
[36:06] strategy and they have it as a Bitcoin
[36:08] play I know a lot of people I don't know
[36:11] to deal with a self- custody I don't
[36:13] know to deal with this unsecure Bitcoin
[36:14] exchange I know stocks I just buy some
[36:17] micro strategy and have exposure like
[36:19] that it's like okay but but yeah he he
[36:22] made a he made it he made it really
[36:24] great and what I'm also interested in in
[36:26] when you started the podcast because it
[36:28] was so significant in my life at least
[36:31] till now um that I made the jump from a
[36:34] steady career where I was working
[36:36] already six years there to actually say
[36:39] like Oh I like that job I like the
[36:41] environment but I like this podcasting
[36:43] thing and this Bitcoin thing even more
[36:46] so I quit that put it aside and and do
[36:49] only that how was how was it for you to
[36:51] like jump from this hobby to a business
[36:54] and from this career to actually being
[36:56] self FL yeah yeah um it wasn't too bad I
[37:00] just found that I had to be very um
[37:02] strict with myself um very sort of
[37:04] disciplined so you know um I did treat
[37:07] it as a job so when I left my corporate
[37:10] it job um it was a very stressful job
[37:12] you know I didn't really enjoy it if I'm
[37:14] honest you know it was too stressful um
[37:16] the pay was great which was one of the
[37:18] issues I sort of felt as though I had
[37:19] what we say is golden handcuffs so you
[37:22] know I was on a really good salary um
[37:24] but you know to be honest with the
[37:26] support of my wife because we had two
[37:27] young kids at the time so it was a big
[37:29] big jump really to go from a full-time
[37:31] highly paid it job to a podcaster you
[37:35] know no one had even heard of what a
[37:36] podcast it was uh but you know it was it
[37:40] was a hobby and I really enjoyed
[37:41] creating the the content it was mainly
[37:43] of a weekends so I really enjoyed it and
[37:46] when people started to reach out to
[37:48] offer money to support it I thought well
[37:51] you know it's it's it's potentially
[37:53] viable I'll give it a year and see you
[37:55] know how how we can build it um and um I
[37:58] I was lucky enough at the time because
[37:59] there were so few of us uh especially in
[38:01] the video podcast I um I had an
[38:04] interview by a guy called Robert scoble
[38:05] I don't know if you're familiar with
[38:06] Robert scoble he's a um a us-based um
[38:09] sort of tech influencer used to work for
[38:11] Microsoft but he um he was kind enough
[38:14] to interview me on one of his shows and
[38:15] uh to be honest it sort of took off from
[38:17] there because he had a big audience so
[38:19] people got involved uh got interested
[38:21] came to see the site signed up as
[38:23] members and you know it sort of
[38:25] snowboard from there really but yeah
[38:27] it's it was a big leap a big leap of
[38:29] faith um but I treated it as a job so
[38:31] I'd always I'd work every day Monday to
[38:33] Friday 9 till 5: um and I'm I'm
[38:37] fortunate in that I'm I could work by
[38:39] myself quite easily you know I didn't
[38:41] need a a team around me to energize me I
[38:45] could quite easily energize myself to to
[38:47] actually produce the content and it was
[38:49] fascinating as well I learned a lot
[38:52] about website development and you know
[38:54] the psychology of of members and stuff
[38:56] you know and how to to U how to how to
[38:59] grow the business from that point on so
[39:01] yeah it was it was a big leap of faith
[39:03] but I'm glad it actually did pay off
[39:05] which is a good thing I love it because
[39:08] uh when you did it it was way harder
[39:12] right now it's it's like you have so
[39:13] many
[39:14] testimon so many role models and so many
[39:17] people that already did it we we have so
[39:19] many examples of content producers
[39:21] content creators who like oh yeah you
[39:23] can actually make a little thing out of
[39:25] that and you can make it and you you
[39:26] just have to produce a video and put it
[39:28] on YouTube and YouTube does a lot for
[39:30] you yeah yeah in some respects I it's
[39:32] it's probably it was probably easier
[39:35] when I started uh if I'm honest because
[39:37] there was very little competition uh I
[39:39] mean there wasn't another Mac Tech
[39:41] podcast a video podcast that I can think
[39:44] of at the time I launched there were a
[39:46] couple of audio podcasts um but there
[39:48] were no tutorial podcasts um I say there
[39:51] was no YouTube so um people couldn't
[39:54] well that's that's a negative because
[39:55] they couldn't find you but you know
[39:57] there wasn't really a lot of competition
[39:58] I think it's probably a lot harder um
[40:01] because you've got so much competition
[40:02] now of people actually developing really
[40:04] good quality content that um you know I
[40:07] think it it would be quite difficult for
[40:08] me to replicate what I did then to the
[40:10] level that I got um this this day and
[40:13] age it really would you know would be
[40:16] quite difficult to do that but you know
[40:18] the there there's there's plenty of
[40:20] scope for people to still create great
[40:21] quality content and and push out there
[40:23] it's just based on if the if you produce
[40:25] good quality content people will find it
[40:26] and then it will will be you know
[40:28] interesting I I thought it it was
[40:30] probably harder because also there were
[40:32] not that many people watching but it's
[40:34] like the probably like there was so many
[40:37] less people producing but still a lot of
[40:39] people watching and and and then just
[40:41] searching for that kind of content and
[40:43] now yeah everyone is watching and
[40:45] everyone is listening but there are so
[40:47] many people actually doing a Bitcoin
[40:48] podcast I even like just like a Bitcoin
[40:50] podcast there's so many out there
[40:52] already yeah uh well the good thing is
[40:55] though um that it's very similar to the
[40:58] Mac I mean I did a Mac tutorial podcast
[41:01] and the Mac Community especially back
[41:03] then when this is before iPods this is
[41:05] before iPads and iPhones it was just the
[41:07] Mac basically um the the the community
[41:10] was fantastic um and very supportive so
[41:14] you know people people really wanted to
[41:16] um take the information in and I see
[41:18] that there are parallels with the
[41:20] Bitcoin Community because you know the
[41:21] Bitcoin Community is very supportive
[41:23] they want lots of content uh there's so
[41:26] much to learn that you know they they
[41:28] really do um want more and more podcasts
[41:32] and one of the things I was going to
[41:33] thinking of when I retired was perhaps
[41:34] do my own not not um not a big podcast
[41:38] but you know perhaps a a Bitcoin
[41:39] tutorial type podcast um so completely
[41:42] away from the Mac side of things but
[41:43] just just really um for complete newbies
[41:47] you know just just let them understand
[41:49] the basic principles of of what Bitcoin
[41:51] is and you know how you can get into
[41:54] Bitcoin and what wallets are and stuff
[41:55] like that but but very much aim at the
[41:57] complete newbies um so that was an idea
[42:00] I had I haven't sort of brought it
[42:01] fruition yet but uh it's something I
[42:03] might do in the not too distant future I
[42:06] don't know we'll have to see I would
[42:07] love it I would love
[42:09] it yeah I mean the thing is as well is
[42:12] you know would with my age as well I
[42:14] think there's a lot of people um around
[42:16] about my age who've got no clue what
[42:17] Bitcoin is uh I mean it's quite unusual
[42:20] um you know I'm probably one of the
[42:21] older older U bitcoiners I know there's
[42:24] Larry leard and there's a few other
[42:25] people who are of a similar age to me um
[42:28] but I I think people would probably
[42:30] learn more people of my generation would
[42:32] probably learn more or be more
[42:34] approachable or more receptive to
[42:36] information from someone roughly the
[42:38] same age which I think they're not
[42:39] really they're not really given that at
[42:41] the moment so I think there's a
[42:43] possibility there but as I say we'll
[42:44] just have to see how much time that
[42:46] might take up and whether or not it's
[42:47] something I want to uh to to invest my
[42:49] time in probably will but you know see
[42:53] how how old are you if I'm allowed to
[42:55] ask uh 65 yeah 6 next year so officially
[42:58] retiring age next year so no next month
[43:02] yeah next month Yeah you mentioned it
[43:04] before and yes I can actually uh right
[43:06] now I have my statistics out I have uh
[43:10] 12.8% between 55 and 64 years old and I
[43:14] have actually 8% of my viewers are over
[43:17] 65 years old so even such a young guy
[43:22] like me because I'm just like 25 years
[43:24] old uh has a lot of uh people that are
[43:28] older uh in in the community and I even
[43:30] have like a smaller Community I have
[43:32] like Channel memberships also like they
[43:34] are paying for each month okay and I
[43:37] make with them like a video call each
[43:39] month and there is a 76 year old guy in
[43:42] there who I AB absolutely love and and
[43:45] we have great conversations but it's
[43:47] like uh he he he's like 76 and I'm 25
[43:51] there's a the whole life in between um
[43:54] but it's great but we can learn from
[43:56] each other
[43:57] I love it a lot and so I think there's
[43:59] definitely demand there's definitely um
[44:03] an an demand for uh people above 60 to
[44:07] make content uh for Bitcoin that's
[44:10] definitely a thing yeah I think I think
[44:12] youer people as well are more familiar
[44:14] with YouTube and seeking content out you
[44:16] know and and researching and you know
[44:18] just just finding the information that
[44:20] they want quite easily whereas for
[44:22] people over a certain age it doesn't
[44:24] come as natural to them um and I think
[44:26] as well the demand will only increase
[44:28] over time because you know as Bitcoin uh
[44:31] increases in value and becomes more
[44:32] prevalent in the mainstream um you know
[44:34] older people will say Well's what's all
[44:36] this about you know so um I I think that
[44:39] that side of the uh the audience will
[44:42] actually grow over time as well or the
[44:43] people who will need uh good I mean
[44:46] we're not talking about you know how to
[44:48] create you know set up your own node and
[44:50] stuff just just very very basic this is
[44:52] what Bitcoin is this is how you get into
[44:54] it and you know and then some of the
[44:56] benefits behind it um you know but we'll
[45:00] see I just just saw that and and I was
[45:03] fascinated by it I have more uh people
[45:05] in my audience that are over 65 than
[45:08] under
[45:09] 25 really yeah I have 6% exactly under
[45:14] 25 and uh 7.4% over 65 so it's like more
[45:20] people uh above after work than before
[45:24] work so like that I would put it it's
[45:26] interesting to to see yeah yeah yeah
[45:28] yeah it's
[45:29] fascinating um a selfish question that I
[45:32] have right now for you um what would you
[45:35] give me as an adwise as I just started
[45:37] out the podcasting of course it's it's
[45:39] way different than when you started
[45:41] podcasting and and when you started
[45:43] membership stuff like that but what's
[45:44] the one advice you would give me for for
[45:47] my podcast and for my uh thing that I
[45:49] just like started that's a tough one um
[45:52] yeah it's just be true to yourself
[45:53] really and and I always put myself in
[45:56] the uh um the other person's shoes so
[45:58] you know if I was watching this what
[46:00] would I want to get from the content I'm
[46:03] producing um you know and and also you
[46:06] know just just just be true to yourself
[46:08] basically and uh always strive to
[46:10] deliver a good quality product um again
[46:13] you know with video people don't realize
[46:14] that the audio on on the video is just
[46:16] as important as the the video so I
[46:18] always sort of used to strive to make
[46:20] sure that the production values were as
[46:22] top-notch as they could possibly be so
[46:24] both in audio quality and the editing um
[46:27] so it was a nice polished product that
[46:28] you could actually ship out to people so
[46:31] yeah you just pay attention to the
[46:32] quality and um you know that's that
[46:34] should be enough to uh to you know to to
[46:37] gain the attention of of a a valued
[46:40] audience I even saw that the audio is
[46:43] more important than the video especially
[46:45] when your video is longer than like five
[46:47] minutes long and M usually like around
[46:49] one hour long we are already recording
[46:52] 50 hours uh 50 minutes now uh 50 hours
[46:55] would be something
[46:57] but uh because more people uh actually
[47:00] listen to it like they I don't know they
[47:02] do laundry or they go for run and just
[47:04] have it on the the earphon so like the
[47:06] audio is way more important as I see it
[47:09] uh than the video but the video is still
[47:11] great if if this has some some things to
[47:14] it like also switch between the crit VI
[47:16] and and the single View and stuff like
[47:18] that so uh I try to do a lot with that
[47:20] and I see also when uh there's a video
[47:23] podcast like I did with sailor where
[47:25] it's actually like there actually in a
[47:27] room together uh people actually like
[47:30] that and and watch longer and and and
[47:32] and do enjoy and actually conversation
[47:35] in an actual real world setting and more
[47:38] than just just remote but people still
[47:41] like the remote stuff because then you
[47:42] can connect people from all around the
[47:44] world really easily I must admit I I
[47:46] tend to I mean I mean I listen to lots
[47:49] of Bitcoin podcasts and I have done you
[47:51] know hundreds of hours if not thousands
[47:53] of hours of podcasts I've consumed over
[47:55] the years um but I I I must admit it's
[47:57] very rare that I'll sit down to watch a
[47:59] video podcast uh I think it might be
[48:01] because my attention span is is a lot
[48:03] less than it used to be uh whereas you
[48:05] know I'll put my earpods in and go for a
[48:07] walk or or walk the dog or something and
[48:08] I I'll listen to a podcast or in the car
[48:11] uh there's another place where I'll
[48:12] listen to podcasts a lot um but it's
[48:14] very I might start watching a podcast
[48:16] and and then never get through it and
[48:18] then listen to the rest on on audio
[48:20] later on but the difference is that if
[48:22] there are charts and stuff when it's
[48:24] valuable to see that visual component
[48:26] then I might go back and rewatch it with
[48:28] the charts and stuff um but yeah yeah so
[48:31] I must admit my you know um the podcast
[48:34] of yours that I've I've consumed I've
[48:36] actually listened to rather than watched
[48:37] um but you know some people are some
[48:39] people do enjoy the video content uh the
[48:41] thing with my video content is that
[48:44] because it's a screencast it's actually
[48:46] showing you the Mac desktop and the
[48:48] software itself so you can't really
[48:51] listen to it you you have to watch it
[48:53] because you know curse is going all over
[48:55] the screen and I'm pointing things out
[48:57] within the application um so that's why
[48:59] mine was a a a total video podcast and
[49:02] an audio podcast would have been
[49:04] completely useless to be honest although
[49:06] I did people have told me in the past
[49:07] that they have listened to my voice to
[49:10] get off to sleep in the nicest possible
[49:11] way they said you because that was
[49:14] another thing with me being English uh
[49:15] most of the audience were from the
[49:17] states and I've been over there quite a
[49:19] few times and met quite a few people
[49:20] over there and they said oh we we love
[49:21] your accent I'm from Liverpool in the UK
[49:24] so we love your accent um but I hope you
[49:26] don't mind me telling you this but I
[49:28] sometimes put you on in the background
[49:29] as I as I drift off to sleep and it just
[49:31] helps me sleep okay well whatever floats
[49:33] your boat you know that's
[49:35] fine I heard that actually too already
[49:40] really I I heard uh some people have me
[49:43] as because I do it every day uh so you
[49:46] can make a nice daily routine with it so
[49:48] some people are like just like run uh
[49:51] when when they're out and like oh I'm
[49:53] running and have my podcast out so like
[49:54] like I always run every day for minutes
[49:57] put your podcast in there or I I have
[50:00] you as my breakfast podcast or like or
[50:03] before sleep like calm down because I
[50:05] usually like I have nonaggressive
[50:08] podcast style I I I don't ask questions
[50:12] that bring up uh any debates like I you
[50:15] rarely rarely uh say to my guests that I
[50:18] disagree on something I rather stick to
[50:20] like I want to know why he thinks like
[50:22] that and not debate him I think that's a
[50:25] way way better thing and and so
[50:27] like to sometimes relax to the podcast
[50:30] as I
[50:31] saw no it's very true Did you saw um
[50:35] because you mentioned attention span um
[50:38] many people make the argument oh the
[50:40] attention span of the general population
[50:42] gets decreased with like the formats of
[50:44] of Tik Tok and and and with the formats
[50:46] of the really small um short video form
[50:50] but then there are also people that make
[50:52] like a Netflix marathon and they stick
[50:54] to it four hours it's it's it's maybe
[50:56] not a good attention but they still hold
[50:58] the attention to something a long time
[51:00] do you do you think that the attention
[51:01] span got decreased over your
[51:05] lifespan um personally yeah yeah I would
[51:09] say so because I used to enjoy TV a lot
[51:11] I used to enjoy movies a lot and now it
[51:13] has to be a really good movie now for me
[51:14] to for it to keep my attention if it if
[51:16] it doesn't grab me within the first 10
[51:17] or 15 minutes you know I I'll move on to
[51:20] something else um although in my own
[51:22] podcast um it was always said to me oh
[51:25] you know you need to make sure short
[51:26] short content you know um but we always
[51:30] I always went with um like a long form
[51:32] video tutorial so i' I'd do like a
[51:35] 10-minute tip video um halfway through
[51:38] the week and then the end of the week it
[51:40] would be like a long form 40 minutes 50
[51:42] minutes sometimes you know which is
[51:44] quite a long time for someone to to keep
[51:47] attention and to study but um the long
[51:49] form ones always seem to do really
[51:50] really well people as long as they were
[51:52] interested in the topic um you know if
[51:55] they if they weren't interested in the
[51:56] particular topic they would probably you
[51:57] know jump out after the first five
[51:58] minutes or so but if it's something they
[52:00] wanted to learn they would actually uh
[52:02] quite enjoy the long form content really
[52:04] but personally yeah I I I have found as
[52:06] I've got older that if it doesn't grab
[52:08] me straight away I'll I'll bail on to
[52:10] something
[52:11] else I now try to use the short form
[52:15] content uh as a interest generation for
[52:19] the long form like I put out five to 10
[52:23] short clips of like 10 seconds one minut
[52:27] 2 minutes 30 seconds 40 seconds whatever
[52:29] it is out to all the platforms
[52:32] automatically distributed and I see
[52:35] people like oh it's interesting the
[52:36] podcast I like that and then I they go
[52:39] and watch the whole thing and it's
[52:40] directly connected and directly linked
[52:42] so this is definitely something also
[52:44] with the inperson stuff I saw that when
[52:46] you have an inperson setting um the
[52:49] short form content actually uh performs
[52:52] way better for the long form content it
[52:54] does not matter that much because more
[52:56] people listen but then if you have short
[52:58] form then this is just what I what I
[53:00] learned yeah um no absolutely absolutely
[53:03] and that's something that I was planning
[53:04] on doing when before I uh moved away
[53:07] from uh sort of managing screencast
[53:09] online we were I think Lee is going to
[53:11] stood sort of take that strategy as well
[53:14] you know uh short 10 15 20 second clips
[53:17] that will bring you back into the long
[53:19] long form tutorials or when I say short
[53:21] form they're like 10 minutes to tip
[53:22] videos which aren't really short form
[53:24] but they're you know a lot longer than
[53:26] the the 22nd uh sort like Tik Tok type
[53:29] clips that there are but yeah that's
[53:30] something that we'll be looking at in
[53:31] screencast online to do that as well
[53:34] amazing then uh we come slowly to our
[53:36] end routine uh which is two questions
[53:39] the one question is always the same
[53:40] question for every guest and the other
[53:41] one is coming from the previous guest uh
[53:44] the first question that is always the
[53:45] same uh what are you currently
[53:47] passionate about besides Bitcoin um well
[53:50] I'm not passionate about it but I've
[53:52] just bought a 3D printer so I've just
[53:55] literally yesterday um you can probably
[53:57] see it over oh it's it's it's pH but on
[54:00] my desk behind me I've just bought a 3D
[54:02] printer um and um fascinating you know
[54:06] really interesting to delve into the
[54:08] technology um consume quite a few
[54:10] YouTube videos about setting it up and
[54:13] some of the aspects um so yeah yeah so
[54:15] that's that's my my current U Obsession
[54:19] let's say I love it a lot I I I
[54:21] intentionally do this question always
[54:23] because I think that bitcoiners are
[54:25] really interesting people and that we
[54:26] can learn from each other other than
[54:29] just Bitcoin and other than just uh uh
[54:32] Bitcoin and some money in the financial
[54:33] aspect so I always try to get get this
[54:35] in the podcast and the other end routine
[54:38] where you get a question from the
[54:40] previous guest without know the previous
[54:42] guest had a question for you without
[54:44] knowing who is actually the the the next
[54:46] guest uh and the question for you is can
[54:49] you share the moment with us when
[54:51] Bitcoin clicked for you and I kind of
[54:53] got an ins similar question already in
[54:55] there uh when when you made the uh yeah
[54:58] I think I got asked it already right
[55:01] yeah yeah that was the 2017 but I'm not
[55:03] quite sure what it was how it had
[55:05] surfaced but yeah that that was
[55:06] roundabout when it clicked for me yeah
[55:09] yeah you do you remember what made it
[55:11] click for you I don't know um I don't
[55:14] know because it's a long time ago
[55:16] now and so much was going on at the time
[55:18] but uh yeah not not really yeah I mean
[55:21] that's when I first gotten interested in
[55:23] it um but I I think when it really
[55:27] clicked you know when when it when it
[55:28] all sort of came together was probably
[55:30] after that when I when I bought my I
[55:32] think it's buying your first Bitcoin um
[55:35] is the moment when it suddenly clicks
[55:37] and you go oh okay I understand what it
[55:39] is now um because before then it's just
[55:42] an abstract concept and and people
[55:44] struggle with the fact that you know oh
[55:46] well it doesn't exist it's digital it's
[55:48] not backed by anything um but then when
[55:50] you actually buy it and you and you you
[55:52] see the technology behind it and you
[55:55] understand oh okay so I've now got um
[55:58] ownership of this bit of the blockchain
[56:01] and oh okay and and I can now use
[56:03] lightning to fling it around and you
[56:05] actually see lightning in operation I I
[56:07] think actually using it buying it using
[56:10] it uh you've got skin in the game and
[56:12] and that actually does sort of Bring It
[56:14] All home to you right instead of all
[56:16] this
[56:16] theoretical um you know gobins about
[56:19] what Bitcoin is no matter how many times
[56:20] you explain it to somebody until they
[56:22] actually get it not physically in their
[56:25] hands but until they have ownership of
[56:27] some Bitcoin I think that's that's when
[56:28] it finally does click for people and
[56:30] understanding the value as well where
[56:32] the value comes from um that that that
[56:35] makes it click as well you know why why
[56:37] it is valuable you have to spend time
[56:38] with people explaining why it is
[56:40] valuable and where the value emanates
[56:41] from it's not the fact that it's it's
[56:43] backed by something it's it's all its
[56:44] utility and um you know everything
[56:46] around that as to why it's valuable
[56:49] amazing uh really really cool and till
[56:52] you have your own Bitcoin podcast um
[56:55] where can people find you where can
[56:57] people reach out to you and ask you
