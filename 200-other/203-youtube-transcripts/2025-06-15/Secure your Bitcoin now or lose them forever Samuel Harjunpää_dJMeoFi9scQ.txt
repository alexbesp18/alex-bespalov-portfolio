[00:00] we're used to getting robbed not having
[00:02] self- custody is just not an option the
[00:04] most hardcore self- custody you can
[00:06] think of is is a brain wallets won't
[00:09] work for
[00:10] 99.99% of people you hit your head you
[00:12] lose it you forget it always comes down
[00:15] to having some sort of information some
[00:18] sort of words that you have to keep for
[00:20] yourself and protect with your life
[00:23] because there's your life energy in if
[00:24] you're in a sinking ship you don't want
[00:25] the ship to sink like this because no
[00:27] one has time to get out right you want
[00:29] it to kind of SN slowly so that everyone
[00:31] has time to get into the life
[00:33] boats it's a crazy Journey Bitcoin I
[00:36] think 2024 will be a really interesting
[00:38] year and I think it will be really uh
[00:41] important also that everybody's holding
[00:44] their own keys and I think uh you're one
[00:46] of the the best persons to talk to with
[00:48] like self- custody with celo uh do I
[00:51] pronounce celo right that's correct it's
[00:54] perfect perfect every name is pronounced
[00:56] how uh you pronounce it in your country
[00:58] right yeah that's that's also right yeah
[01:01] um to start the episode off off I would
[01:05] say like let's start with why like why
[01:09] is it so important uh to hold your own
[01:12] Keys uh especially in 2024 and moving
[01:17] forward sure well I really think it
[01:19] comes down to like the core ethos of
[01:23] Bitcoin like Bitcoin is a is a
[01:26] decentralized monetary system
[01:28] decentralized database for money of
[01:31] course people use it for other things as
[01:34] well but mainly it's a it's a
[01:36] decentralized database for money and
[01:39] decentralization like if we really like
[01:42] dive deep into that world like what word
[01:44] like what it means is you know there's
[01:46] obviously no no central point of failure
[01:49] no central point of control no central
[01:52] point of anything
[01:54] basically everyone participates in the
[01:56] network as an individual obviously there
[01:59] are levels to that like the purest
[02:03] Bitcoin Utopia thinking is like everyone
[02:07] go M your own silicone make your own
[02:09] chips build their own Hardware wallets
[02:11] you know of signing
[02:13] device make make the software yourself
[02:16] obviously that's not a
[02:19] reality um but decentralization more
[02:24] broadly I would say is you know not
[02:26] putting or not giving a central
[02:28] Authority
[02:31] even like the possibility of of doing
[02:34] something fraudulent because well the
[02:36] the Bitcoin space knows better than I
[02:39] think any other space in in finance
[02:41] probably in the world that um trusting
[02:44] your assets with with the custodian with
[02:48] the central party that's it sooner or
[02:51] later something bad will
[02:54] happen and that's not to say that you
[02:57] shouldn't ever use any
[03:00] centralized service for
[03:02] anything but it's more
[03:05] like if you can why not you know take
[03:10] self- custody because it's this asset
[03:13] class allows for it and and it allows
[03:14] for it very easily in contrast to for
[03:17] example cash or gold like you don't want
[03:21] to you you don't want to take out all
[03:23] the money in your bank account and put
[03:25] it under your mattress CU that's not
[03:26] very convenient right you're basically
[03:29] shutting out like 90% of your life or
[03:33] 99% of the modern conveniences because
[03:37] you know no more internet shopping for
[03:38] you because you know you're not going to
[03:41] be sending that cash through the mail
[03:43] with gold as well such a big amount so
[03:46] it's like it's not convenient with other
[03:49] asset classes but but with
[03:51] Bitcoin it is and you can really make it
[03:54] convenient and you can make it fit your
[03:56] own sort
[03:58] of
[04:00] your own security model I would say yeah
[04:04] it's it's a crazy asset that we can have
[04:08] it in our brain and just walk around
[04:10] with it and uh nobody can manipulate it
[04:14] nobody can stop you from using it that's
[04:17] that's still one of the most
[04:19] mind-blowing facts about Bitcoin that
[04:22] the importance of that just came to me
[04:25] while I was researching about Bitcoin
[04:28] and then it bothers me so much watch
[04:29] when people are like uh yeah I bought
[04:34] Bitcoin and I have it on that exchange I
[04:36] mean there there are a lot of things you
[04:38] can do uh in Bitcoin like you can go the
[04:40] extreme rout with completely no kyc
[04:43] peerto peer uh you maybe have cash like
[04:46] physical cash and then you buy from
[04:48] other peers a Bitcoin in real life like
[04:51] you can go to a extreme route but not
[04:55] having self- custody is just not an
[04:58] option at this point I think
[05:00] even if you buy from some exchange even
[05:02] buy from coinbase or some big exchange
[05:04] where you have full KC and stuff like
[05:05] that take it at least to self custody
[05:09] you they know that you have the Bitcoin
[05:12] but in an extreme case they cannot take
[05:14] it from you they can say yeah you have
[05:17] them please give it out to us but they
[05:19] have to force you to give it to you like
[05:21] and I'm still uh um bothered by this
[05:25] whole thing that they are not in fear
[05:28] that Bitcoin is on a sale on a
[05:31] centralized exchange but they are in
[05:33] fear and even some bitcoiners are in
[05:36] fear to having their Bitcoin in self-
[05:39] custody what do you think will it take
[05:42] for for the majority of people to take
[05:45] self- custody and take that fear away
[05:49] and make it like an easy thing and I
[05:51] think with Cel also you have like two
[05:53] products that kind of work towards that
[05:56] that future maybe you can elaborate on
[05:58] on that
[06:00] yeah so like I said that there are
[06:02] different levels to self- custody right
[06:04] so maybe like the most hardcore self-
[06:08] custody you can think of is is a brain
[06:12] wallet right it's
[06:14] like very extreme won't work for 99. 99%
[06:20] of people because it's it's just not
[06:22] it's just not smart or convenient you
[06:25] hit your head you lose it you forget it
[06:27] like whatever happens you get too drunk
[06:29] one night and you know wake up and you
[06:32] don't remember it but it's like there
[06:34] are different levels to it so really
[06:37] what what you have to or what everyone
[06:39] has to figure out is is what is my level
[06:43] of self- custody like if I'm an if I'm
[06:46] an immigrant fleeing like an oppressive
[06:51] government through a border or whatever
[06:55] you know probably I wouldn't want to
[06:58] have my
[07:00] Keys written down on anything or on me
[07:02] that's probably when I would use a brain
[07:04] wallet um but then again if if I if I
[07:07] live in the Western World um I have a
[07:10] home I have a house an apartment
[07:13] whatever um I don't have kids you know
[07:17] I'm I'm alone uh that's in that type of
[07:20] situation you know just having your keys
[07:24] written down stored in your bank vault
[07:26] or maybe doing like a Shamir backup
[07:28] where you split it in in in three
[07:30] different locations is is actually very
[07:33] easy like if you think about stuff that
[07:36] you you have like that anyways like you
[07:40] know people have paintings that are
[07:42] worth a lot people have you know their
[07:43] passports I I can't think of
[07:45] a I've never lost my passport for
[07:48] example and I carry that around when I
[07:50] travel so it's like assigning assigning
[07:53] a certain like value and meaning to that
[07:56] like private key is very important
[07:59] obviously that's that's the first step
[08:01] the second step is how how do you like
[08:03] store it the safest um and that's like I
[08:07] said up to up to each
[08:09] person themselves to decide like you
[08:12] know you might want to sort in a bank
[08:14] vault in your house just one just just
[08:18] have your private key on one you know
[08:21] object whether it's paper we we do a
[08:23] stainless steel backup which is
[08:25] obviously more
[08:27] durable uh but you can St in on on one
[08:31] object in one place if that's what you
[08:34] want if you're not afraid of anyone you
[08:38] know coming in knowing where it is
[08:40] robbing you if if that's something
[08:42] you're afraid of you might want to do
[08:44] like a Shamir Shamir thing or if you
[08:46] have kids you want to leave the Bitcoin
[08:48] to you can you can do like a two out of
[08:51] three multisig type of solution where
[08:53] you have um you have your seed split up
[08:57] on three different um three different
[09:00] pieces of paper or metal or whatever you
[09:02] decide to use and you might store one of
[09:05] them in your bank vault at
[09:08] home
[09:09] um obviously no one can do anything with
[09:12] it you can't move the funds with just
[09:16] that key but then you could give like
[09:18] for example a lawyer another another key
[09:22] another copy of the key and tell the
[09:24] lawyer like if I pass away give this to
[09:25] my kids uh with my you know Testament my
[09:30] state um you could put one in a bank
[09:33] vault for example like if you're worried
[09:35] about losing it
[09:38] um there there are a bunch of things
[09:40] that give friends or family
[09:42] like it's it's really the difficulty
[09:45] really comes from the fact that people
[09:46] need to start thinking for themselves
[09:48] right and that that brings me to like
[09:51] the the other end of the spectrum where
[09:53] you you can still do like self- custody
[09:55] but have um have sort of a
[10:00] kind of like a third party uh you know
[10:02] The Ledger recover thing caused a lot of
[10:04] controversy in the Bitcoin space which
[10:07] is understandable it's mostly I'd say
[10:09] it's like a PR mistake from Ledger doing
[10:12] that you know not really reading the
[10:15] crowd reading reading their customers um
[10:18] because currently people in self-
[10:19] custody are are like hardcore self-
[10:22] custody maximalists like me and you
[10:25] probably but but there's obviously going
[10:27] to be like a a different to it right and
[10:30] and what I think is important is is
[10:32] separating like self- custody and Cold
[10:34] Storage like you can have your keys in
[10:37] Cold
[10:38] Storage but it doesn't have to be self-
[10:42] custodial so that's that's like a very
[10:44] important um like distinction to make
[10:47] because self- custody and Cold Storage
[10:48] have have usually gone like hand inand
[10:50] they've been basically synonyms but but
[10:53] they're not really if you think about it
[10:55] like you could take your Hardware
[10:57] wallets take out the seed Fray
[10:59] write it down in a piece of paper and
[11:01] take the the piece of paper to a bank
[11:04] vault right now it's not like now it's
[11:07] not self custodial you you you let the
[11:09] bank take care of it but you still have
[11:11] your keys in Cold Storage on the
[11:12] hardware wallets so that's what I mean
[11:15] when when I say that you you have like
[11:16] different levels to it and obviously at
[11:20] some point um services like ler recover
[11:24] similar
[11:25] Services um will have users because
[11:29] there are obviously people who are not
[11:32] going to
[11:34] dive you know head first into self
[11:37] custody into into
[11:39] Bitcoin um and and those type of people
[11:43] you know they either do it on an
[11:45] exchange or they they use something
[11:50] something like the recovery
[11:53] service um me personally I would never
[11:55] use anything like that cuz I want to
[11:59] be in control I want to I want to set up
[12:01] my own system depending on my own
[12:04] situation but but for some some people
[12:07] situations that might be the best
[12:09] solution and it's that's what free
[12:12] markets are that's like what it's all
[12:14] about people bringing out different
[12:15] types of services um and competing
[12:19] competing with them um offering
[12:22] different solutions yeah I think also
[12:24] that like like I hope I can imagine it
[12:27] but uh maybe I'm I'm just too hopeful
[12:30] and too real too optimistic on the
[12:32] future but I think Key Management is
[12:35] something that everybody has to learn
[12:37] just as like how to write an email how
[12:39] to how to set up a normal Google account
[12:43] like those things now so normal for
[12:46] everybody but just like 20 30 years ago
[12:49] uh you could not even do it so like uh
[12:52] we we are progressing and I think there
[12:55] will be a lot of uh Tech that is being
[13:00] developed in the space uh and probably
[13:03] also um keeps the ecosystem um in intact
[13:08] like there like for every person on
[13:10] every level there are different kind of
[13:12] TXS and different kind of security
[13:14] levels as you said when you go on out of
[13:18] a country that has an oppressive uh
[13:20] regime and has like War maybe even you
[13:23] don't want to have like one piece of
[13:26] paper where there's like one and the
[13:28] first and then there all the 24 words
[13:30] and maybe there's like Bitcoin wallet
[13:32] written on the top like make it really
[13:35] obvious like just like destroy it
[13:38] remember it and then write it down when
[13:40] you're in the Target country like this
[13:42] is this is still risk do you take
[13:45] because you can fall and hit your head
[13:47] and forget it and your your thing is
[13:49] also way but it always comes down to
[13:52] securing some some piece of information
[13:56] like even if you have like a Google
[13:58] account
[13:59] uh or a bank account where somebody
[14:02] hacks in you have a username you have a
[14:04] password someone comes in they steal the
[14:07] money the money is gone anyway so like
[14:08] it always comes down to having uh some
[14:13] sort of information some sort of words
[14:17] that you have to keep uh for yourself
[14:20] and and protect uh with your life
[14:22] because there's your life energy in
[14:24] there and I hope we come to the point
[14:26] where everybody does that uh maybe about
[14:29] you like how did you find your way in
[14:32] Bitcoin and why are you now so
[14:34] passionate that you even like found a
[14:36] company in in the in the
[14:39] ecosystem sure it's a it's a long
[14:42] journey like I think everyone everyone
[14:44] has a long journey into Bitcoin it's a
[14:47] bumpy road for sure um but it's worth it
[14:51] uh so
[14:52] um I'm I'm this is what I usually say I
[14:55] say I'm I'm of the generation that
[14:57] doesn't really remember when they heard
[14:59] about Bitcoin for the first
[15:01] time um I I know that the first time I
[15:05] really ran into Bitcoin um was in 2013
[15:08] when uh Ross Alber got
[15:12] arrested um I was watching the news I I
[15:16] think or reading or reading the
[15:17] newspaper maybe both but uh I I ran into
[15:19] this silk CAD dark web
[15:22] thing and um I got really uh interested
[15:26] initially in the whole dark web Deep Web
[15:30] uh thing you know there's an internet
[15:31] the government can't control like people
[15:34] selling all types of illegal stuff there
[15:38] all kinds of crazy crazy stuff going on
[15:42] and um I got very interested in it um
[15:45] and I just wanted to figure out what it
[15:48] what it was um so I I learned how to uh
[15:52] you know get a get a tour
[15:54] browser I'd find the marketplaces you
[15:57] know SE cro 2.0 pop top pretty much
[15:59] immediately after uh Sil CAD 1.0 got
[16:02] shut down um and I found my way there
[16:06] and uh I noticed that they were using
[16:08] this uh crazy internet money called
[16:12] Bitcoin uh to
[16:14] transact uh this is a pretty typical
[16:17] story of of people my age getting into
[16:19] into Bitcoin through through the dark
[16:22] web um but like I said I I was initially
[16:25] not too interested in uh in Bitcoin
[16:28] itself I was more interested in in the
[16:30] dark web in
[16:32] this kind kind of the thought of Bitcoin
[16:34] like there's something on the Internet
[16:36] that the government can't control like
[16:38] governments can't control like it this
[16:40] is like a almost like a a Libertarian
[16:45] Utopia like a digital libertarian Utopia
[16:48] that's that's on my computer or or
[16:51] phone and um yeah so so I got I got
[16:55] really really interested in that and and
[16:58] I started sort of nerding out about
[17:01] technology in general um and and about
[17:05] these like Freedom Technologies more
[17:07] broadly um then like the the final nail
[17:11] in the coffin I'd say uh like when I
[17:13] when I truly got
[17:15] Bitcoin um was in
[17:18] um I'd say
[17:20] 2019 when I was uh I was living in
[17:24] Argentina for a
[17:25] year and as you can imagine that kind of
[17:29] opens up your your eyes
[17:32] to well um a multitude of different
[17:35] scams but but mainly uh mainly the scam
[17:39] around uh inflation money printing
[17:42] central
[17:43] banks so that's when I really really
[17:46] like got it like I was interested in it
[17:49] before for the for the technology for
[17:52] the you
[17:53] know this is pretty pretty uh cringe
[17:58] thing to to say like I was in it for the
[17:59] technology was but I was I was initially
[18:01] like really just in it for for the like
[18:04] the freedom aspect like this is this is
[18:07] cool like no one can control this um
[18:11] there are no taxes on it
[18:13] like like it's it's pretty Rad but then
[18:17] then I really started understanding the
[18:20] like
[18:21] U I would say more philosophical uh like
[18:24] societal impacts it could have and
[18:27] that's like when I
[18:29] I became super passionate that's when I
[18:32] really like realized this is this is a
[18:34] huge
[18:35] thing um and I I I understood the the
[18:39] infrastructure like the the ins and outs
[18:42] of how how Bitcoin
[18:44] Works um so it was like I got that first
[18:48] and then later on I got the the
[18:50] philosophical societal aspects of it and
[18:53] that's sort of how I got so passionate
[18:56] what do you think will be the like the
[18:58] societal change that will happen on a
[19:01] full like if we zoom out like 50 years
[19:05] and we are kind of getting really close
[19:07] to like a Bitcoin standard you can see a
[19:10] little bit of it like in El
[19:12] Salvador uh but what will be the change
[19:15] that will happen on on the world uh with
[19:18] with Bitcoin as a basis with a
[19:21] fundamental layer in
[19:23] Bitcoin well I think the most
[19:26] interesting interesting part of it
[19:29] is well we're used to getting robbed at
[19:32] this point we're used to prices going up
[19:37] much faster than you know our salaries
[19:41] go up but um a Bitcoin St it's basically
[19:45] like more and more people falling into
[19:48] like poverty every year basically of
[19:50] course governments can change the
[19:52] definition of poverty how much they like
[19:54] you know but but still people are people
[19:57] are getting poorer people can afford
[20:00] less and less each
[20:02] year and
[20:04] um yeah it's it's not really good for
[20:07] morale in general in in the population
[20:10] it
[20:11] really like uh it really starts
[20:16] affecting the way people look at Society
[20:20] in general like people become much more
[20:23] depressed much more I would say not
[20:27] hopeful about the future because they
[20:30] feel like the future is going to be less
[20:33] than what you have
[20:35] now um obviously it's not not a bad
[20:38] thing to live in the moment like enjoy
[20:40] the moment but but people are not
[20:43] thinking forward because it's it's
[20:46] depressing right it's it feels like it's
[20:49] going to be worse tomorrow than it is
[20:53] today um so I I cuz ultimately like
[20:57] Society is just just about people right
[20:59] people form form the
[21:01] society and uh the general feeling
[21:04] amongst people is what what creates like
[21:08] a prosperous Society or or like a not
[21:11] prosperous Society so I believe that one
[21:14] of the biggest things like setting aside
[21:16] all the all the money things Finance
[21:19] questions uh I I think the biggest
[21:20] impact will be that that people will be
[21:22] more hopeful about the future and more
[21:26] optimistic and
[21:28] um and they can feel themselves uh
[21:31] progressing much more uh than they maybe
[21:35] would be now
[21:38] because it's it's not just money is just
[21:42] a tool right so it's it's it's not like
[21:45] just people getting extra money or being
[21:47] able to buy extra stuff makes them
[21:49] happier but people knowing that they
[21:52] have
[21:53] like more monetary freedom in the future
[21:58] future than they have now that's it
[22:00] lifts a huge weight off your shoulder
[22:03] like I don't know if this is true but um
[22:07] I think someone said that the number one
[22:09] reason for divorce at least in the US is
[22:13] finances
[22:15] um and you know that that kind of tells
[22:18] you something
[22:19] about how how finances links to
[22:25] happiness but again it's it's not about
[22:27] like
[22:28] having the money to buy like crazy stuff
[22:31] it's like having the money
[22:33] to to like be free and and and feel like
[22:37] you're progressing that's that's I think
[22:40] the biggest so in in in short I think I
[22:42] think people will be happy much happier
[22:44] on a Bitcoin standard I'm super excited
[22:46] to announce that this podcast got the
[22:49] first ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[22:54] only from day one and they teach and
[22:56] preach self custody this is my goto
[23:00] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[23:02] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[23:04] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[23:08] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[23:10] support this podcast use code Robin and
[23:13] click the link in the description yeah
[23:16] it's interesting like you said it like
[23:18] Bitcoin in the end of the day it's just
[23:20] money uh but when you when you're like
[23:24] running a
[23:26] marathon uh and uh running on a Bitcoin
[23:29] standard is like you're running on a
[23:30] solid Street and on a Fiat standard is
[23:33] like you're still running but you're
[23:35] running on Sand like you you you fall
[23:38] down so much faster you you you have to
[23:42] run so much more to get to the same
[23:44] point as you would run on a normal solid
[23:47] street with good shoes and in the sand
[23:50] you're like just you're just trying to
[23:52] keep up with the inflation and uh like
[23:55] to to actually keep up with inflation
[23:57] you don't even uh you really need to
[23:59] step up your game every time you are
[24:03] doing anything like this with you have
[24:07] to get the salary basically like 50%
[24:09] increased every year to really keep up
[24:12] with the asset inflation with with house
[24:15] prices with with all the good stuff I
[24:17] think uh like the CPI numbers the
[24:21] inflation numbers that we we have been
[24:24] given they like with 5% 10% this is for
[24:27] me all because when you look at
[24:30] how much more expensive a nice house in
[24:33] a nice neighborhood gets or how much
[24:36] more expensive the uh food prices in
[24:39] restaurants where you want to go with
[24:41] your friends in there because it's a
[24:43] nice restaurant like all the nice things
[24:47] are getting more expensive uh um and way
[24:51] more fast expensive than the the
[24:55] banana like of course banana is is not
[24:58] getting like oh now it's 10 now it's 50
[25:01] like I think we get there but not as
[25:05] fast as the the really good things like
[25:07] it always depends when you when you live
[25:10] in I think saor said it in the beginning
[25:12] so good when you live in uh your parents
[25:14] basement only watch Netflix uh and and
[25:18] and and live that kind of a life you are
[25:21] not bought by inflation like the Netflix
[25:24] subscription will not be crazy in the
[25:26] next years I guess
[25:28] uh so you will keep up with inflation
[25:31] but if you want anything good in life
[25:33] you have to work a lot to keep up if
[25:36] you're working in a Fiat standard and
[25:38] this will completely change society if
[25:41] people get the Hope back that they can
[25:43] actually build on something solid so I
[25:46] think you you said it really really good
[25:49] maybe in the terms of building something
[25:52] solid uh like what did motivate you to
[25:55] to build celo to being a and Bitcoin
[25:58] entrepreneur as I understand it is
[26:00] really Bitcoin focused like I saw some
[26:02] some videos and it's all on bitcoin
[26:04] focused like what did motivate you to
[26:07] start this off and like how far are you
[26:09] are you still a onean show or how is
[26:11] this the setup going no we're we're
[26:15] multiple people I've been with my
[26:17] co-founder R3 for two years um and we
[26:21] have uh some Engineers also working uh
[26:25] part-time with us to uh to build the
[26:27] found Foundation uh we're
[26:29] still we're currently getting into uh a
[26:32] place where we really have
[26:34] everything mapped out so to say mainly
[26:37] regarding our Hardware wallet
[26:39] clavis uh that's a that's obviously a a
[26:43] big uh big project we have our our key
[26:47] store yois which is at the end of the
[26:50] day a pretty simple product uh but kind
[26:53] of our entry into the
[26:54] space um but what really uh got me
[26:59] interested in it in it was
[27:01] um well I first of all I felt like I
[27:04] could contribute I felt like I could
[27:05] bring something um I felt like there was
[27:09] there was something I could contribute
[27:10] with like I think that's where it where
[27:14] it comes from
[27:16] like I was I was thinking about like the
[27:19] experience of using Bitcoin the
[27:23] experience of of like the the the
[27:26] general wallet space um and I kind of
[27:30] came to the conclusion that you know
[27:34] there's the wallets is for Bitcoin like
[27:38] what the search engine and browser was
[27:40] for the internet like like it's it's the
[27:43] it's everything like without the
[27:47] wallet there there is no Bitcoin without
[27:49] a search engine a browser there's no
[27:51] internet right it's like the the
[27:53] Cornerstone of everything and I thought
[27:56] that that there really isn't there isn't
[27:59] like a wallet that in my opinion has has
[28:02] cracked the
[28:03] code and I felt like like I could bring
[28:06] something uh different to the table
[28:09] where where I could basically take a
[28:12] swing at cracking the code and I think
[28:14] like one one thing I I got focused on
[28:18] was that that it's too like how would I
[28:22] say segregated like you have hot wallets
[28:24] you have cold wallets you have custodial
[28:26] non-custodial
[28:29] and um I thought there has to be like
[28:31] some some golden Middle Road to
[28:36] take
[28:37] because you know this is this is very
[28:41] confusing for regular people right it's
[28:44] like you have you have it's
[28:48] basically too many options kind of there
[28:51] needs to be something that kind of
[28:53] brings together everything like the best
[28:55] of best of everything and sort of puts
[28:59] it into one package right and um well
[29:04] the first thing I had in mind is well
[29:07] obviously Bas layer Bitcoin transactions
[29:10] are not going to be what people are
[29:12] going to be paying stuff with right um
[29:17] like you're not going to go to the kiosk
[29:19] to get a coffee with uh a base Bas layer
[29:23] transaction so um the next next question
[29:26] was like okay so what what is going to
[29:29] be the medium through which you let's
[29:31] say purchase like a regular coffee how's
[29:33] that how's that user experience going to
[29:36] be
[29:36] like and um well the there are a bunch
[29:40] of answers right it's not
[29:43] like there's one thing uh but lightning
[29:48] lightning is uh is a great thing in my
[29:51] opinion lightning is it's it's fantastic
[29:53] the infrastructure is it's great it's
[29:55] it's ingenious um but the the problem I
[29:59] see with lightning for like everyday
[30:02] people is
[30:04] that well first of
[30:07] all you kind of need to set up the
[30:11] infrastructure right like you need to
[30:13] well you again you have two choices here
[30:15] you can have self custodial lightning or
[30:17] you can have like custodial lightning
[30:19] and at the end of the day like if if the
[30:22] lightning is going to be custodial then
[30:25] what's the difference of just having it
[30:27] on an
[30:28] exchange right it's just that there's
[30:30] really no like the only difference is
[30:32] okay I can I can move lightning funds to
[30:35] like a a non-custodial
[30:37] lightning wallet through but but it's
[30:39] still like an exchange can do that like
[30:41] relay for
[30:43] example
[30:45] um has a lightning integration so it's
[30:47] it's kind of like
[30:49] a a question of okay so lightning works
[30:53] if it's custodial
[30:56] right and um and custodial
[31:00] services like sooner or later something
[31:02] bad
[31:03] happens something bad I'm not saying
[31:06] everything goes to hell like goes down
[31:08] but sooner or later something bad
[31:10] happens
[31:11] so I was thinking there has to be like
[31:14] there has to be a better better way like
[31:16] a better system of doing this also
[31:18] lightning transactions are cheap but um
[31:23] still there's there's a
[31:25] cost um
[31:28] and also like separating onchain and and
[31:31] lightning it's like so I have a
[31:33] different app for my for my spending
[31:36] then I have different app for my saving
[31:37] or or then I have like a device for my
[31:40] saving kind of gets confusing like you
[31:43] kind of want to bring everything
[31:45] together so so the infrastructure we're
[31:47] going for is
[31:51] basically you have um a hardware wallet
[31:55] which serves as as your wallet just like
[31:59] most people still carry a wallet
[32:01] around um and now the first question
[32:04] people usually have is why would I carry
[32:06] my Hardware Wallets on me like that's
[32:09] stupid right like why would I carry
[32:11] everything with me and the answer to
[32:14] that is like you don't you don't carry
[32:16] everything in the hardware wallets
[32:19] what's beautiful with Bitcoin is that
[32:20] you can you can do a an HD hierarchical
[32:24] deterministic wallet where you basically
[32:27] from the
[32:28] same seed phrase you can generate
[32:31] multiple wallets
[32:33] right and uh you can generate a savings
[32:37] wallet so the infrastructure we're going
[32:39] for is you generate a savings wallet and
[32:40] you generate a spending
[32:42] wallet um and the saving saving wallet's
[32:45] private key is completely wiped off the
[32:48] device after you generate it so you
[32:50] generate the the Saving Private key and
[32:52] you generate the addresses to it but
[32:55] then you wipe the the saving PR private
[32:57] key so on the hardware wallet you just
[33:00] have your saving
[33:03] addresses this is to avoid stuff like
[33:05] clipboard hacking where you know
[33:08] people uh people uh spam your your uh
[33:12] clipboard with their
[33:15] address um like if you if you uh send
[33:18] send your friend for example hey this is
[33:20] my Bitcoin address and someone gets in
[33:22] between and and you send the wrong
[33:24] address and they send the funds there um
[33:26] so so that's like the point of having
[33:29] even your addresses in the offline
[33:32] environment um but
[33:35] then you also want like a savings sorry
[33:38] a spendings account where you can spend
[33:40] from like Apple pay Google pay uh style
[33:45] like very easy convenient and and a
[33:49] thing I I always like wanted to do and I
[33:52] never understood why it doesn't exist
[33:54] well I do now uh but but I didn't
[33:57] understand it before is why isn't there
[34:00] a payment service where I can send money
[34:04] for free anywhere in the world
[34:09] instantly well obviously that that
[34:11] exists with lightning now but it's it's
[34:12] not exactly
[34:13] free um all the time and it's it's a bit
[34:18] cumbersome to set up um but then then I
[34:21] started in finding out about about like
[34:25] uh federations um fed thement stuff like
[34:28] that and obviously improving Bitcoin
[34:30] privacy is is also an important thing um
[34:34] so we started thinking of this like
[34:37] um sort of like a uh a
[34:42] nonprofit payment Network run by the
[34:46] Bitcoin Community like different Bitcoin
[34:48] associations around the
[34:50] world um who basically um run this type
[34:54] of federation that's nonprofit so that
[34:57] there's there are no transaction fees
[35:00] whatsoever and uh you can transact
[35:03] instantly for free anywhere in the world
[35:06] uh so it's it's very much like
[35:08] Fint uh but the difference is that
[35:14] because uh Hardware Hardware
[35:16] manufacturers obviously make their money
[35:18] from
[35:19] Hardware where software software makers
[35:23] take transaction fees
[35:25] because software it costs money to to
[35:29] build and maintain software so you need
[35:31] to take some transaction fees but we
[35:34] thought you know if you could have like
[35:38] a like a kind of like a global payment
[35:41] Federation run by
[35:43] nonprofits that are funded by Hardware
[35:47] manufacturers who basically donate money
[35:49] to them so they can run the software
[35:52] independently uh and these are like
[35:54] entities the Bitcoin Community selects
[35:56] and
[35:57] that are like run by um Bitcoin
[36:02] Community people basically whoever
[36:04] whoever the Bitcoin Community wants to
[36:06] to run it um that that would be sort of
[36:11] a a dream
[36:13] infrastructure
[36:15] because it's still like like the the
[36:18] problem comes to like decentralization
[36:21] right like obviously you want you want
[36:24] Bas layer Bitcoin uh in custody for your
[36:28] savings because there you don't you
[36:30] don't want to take any counterparty risk
[36:33] but the question is like when you want
[36:35] spending money you you're going to when
[36:38] you want money to move faster and
[36:39] cheaper you're going to need to take on
[36:42] some counterparty risk right it's like
[36:45] you either do it self custodia lightning
[36:47] where your counterparty risk is your own
[36:49] node which is a a single point of
[36:51] failure um or you do custodial lightning
[36:55] where the the custodian as the
[36:57] counterparty
[36:59] risk or you do
[37:01] something more in the direction of of
[37:04] what I'm proposing here where you have
[37:06] like a a maximally
[37:08] decentralized kind of like a layer two
[37:11] solution where you could have for
[37:13] example
[37:15] um starting off with like for example 15
[37:19] Bitcoin associations around the world we
[37:21] have a pretty active Bitcoin Association
[37:23] in Finland it's obviously nonprofit
[37:25] Grassroots movement
[37:27] they run their lightning nodes um
[37:29] provide uh lightning Services lightning
[37:32] payment services to U businesses here in
[37:35] Finland uh but but have those type of
[37:37] Grassroots nonprofit uh players around
[37:40] the world basically run
[37:44] this run this um payment layer you know
[37:51] that uh they can do faster transactions
[37:53] and it's separate from the lightning
[37:58] ler
[38:00] well yes and no so it would kind of I
[38:04] see lightning personally as like a um as
[38:08] like a service provider settlement layer
[38:12] in the long
[38:13] run like for example you could have
[38:15] these different federations like if if
[38:17] you uh looked at like for example what
[38:19] fedin does fedt basically the the system
[38:23] is they have their own sort of
[38:26] Federation
[38:27] that has uh ecash like Bitcoin ecash
[38:31] it's like a multisig a multisig on on
[38:34] the Bitcoin base layer that holds x
[38:36] amount of Bitcoin and then the
[38:39] Federation issues the same amount of of
[38:42] ecash tokens that are trans transferred
[38:44] completely anonymously but there's like
[38:48] a a peg to the Bitcoin in the multis so
[38:51] they can't make any more Bitcoin so it's
[38:53] transparent in that way um
[38:57] but then like for example if if if one
[38:59] Federation if you want you're part of
[39:01] one Federation and your friend is a part
[39:03] of another Federation you basically use
[39:06] different wallet providers or whatever
[39:08] and you want to send money from from one
[39:10] Federation to another then lightning is
[39:12] sort of like a like
[39:15] a a bridge there so the federations have
[39:18] a lightning Channel open towards each
[39:20] other and they can settle funds through
[39:22] the lightning
[39:24] Channel fast and and very for for very
[39:27] cheap so then it's that's kind of so
[39:29] it's more like a layer on top of of of
[39:32] lightning where when lightning will be
[39:35] uh or lightning is has some challenges
[39:39] as you said uh like and I think also
[39:42] there will be layers above
[39:44] lightning uh I mean uh when you look at
[39:48] what relay is doing or what the other
[39:51] exchanges are doing this is kind of also
[39:53] layer above Bitcoin above lightning
[39:55] whatever
[39:57] uh so I do think if we are actually at
[40:00] the point where uh we have I don't know
[40:04] four billion people five billion people
[40:07] transacting with Bitcoin on a daily
[40:09] basis buying their coffee with it like
[40:12] right now we don't have so much volume
[40:15] like most Bitcoin has just hle on they
[40:18] buy they move it to cold uh storage you
[40:21] move the self custody and then they live
[40:24] there forever or for years
[40:27] uh but when we come to the point where
[40:29] so much traffic is going on and
[40:31] everybody is is buying and the circular
[40:34] economy is is is Flowing uh I kind of
[40:37] feel like we need a lot more development
[40:40] on bitcoin and that's a that's an
[40:41] amazing thing because Bitcoin is the
[40:43] base layer nobody can manipulate it and
[40:46] then people can build on top of that
[40:48] layer layer two layer three layer 4 some
[40:51] applications whatever and everybody can
[40:54] do whatever they want like there can be
[40:56] so many different solutions and in the
[40:59] end of the day as in a free market the
[41:02] uh the person can choose or do I go with
[41:05] a custodial lightning wallet or do I go
[41:08] with my normal exchange that has an
[41:11] wallet integrated where I can spend it
[41:13] or maybe I don't know X twiter is also
[41:16] coming up with payments I think this or
[41:17] next year maybe you can put some Bitcoin
[41:21] in there and transact with everyone you
[41:23] know on on Twitter uh that all good and
[41:27] there will be so much more solutions the
[41:29] important thing I think always is that
[41:32] you have the option to self custody on a
[41:35] base layer where nobody can with
[41:37] your savings this this is the important
[41:40] part and I am not as educated as I
[41:44] should be on payment layers above
[41:47] Bitcoin uh because for me ER this is
[41:51] something that still has to be developed
[41:53] and I'm not that kind of T of developer
[41:57] I'm actually software developer uh was
[41:59] right now I'm not developing anything
[42:01] but I able to to do that uh but I'm not
[42:05] that deep into that so I kind of always
[42:09] hear Solutions and fedman and what you
[42:12] saying is also very interesting uh with
[42:15] having federations and like I don't know
[42:18] 50 hundred different kind of local
[42:21] places where they transact with it with
[42:24] each other um I don't know if this would
[42:27] be would be the future or something else
[42:29] like there's so much going on and I
[42:31] think the the important part is to
[42:33] remember we are so freaking
[42:35] early there will be so much coming out
[42:38] uh there will there will come those
[42:40] killer payment apps on bitcoin that will
[42:43] start as a startup in eight years
[42:47] we the founders are right now just uh in
[42:51] in some school maybe even they're like
[42:54] maybe it's now 17 years old like it's
[42:56] it's it's crazy to think what what will
[42:59] happen like we are not like when you
[43:01] compare it to the internet we not even
[43:02] in the year 2000 the Googles the apples
[43:05] the Facebooks they're all coming on like
[43:08] they they're just getting built and
[43:10] that's an interesting thing to say yeah
[43:13] so but you were always a laser focused
[43:16] on bitcoin right you or did you had
[43:18] experience with like shitcoin phase or
[43:21] like
[43:22] some I think everyone has uh or at least
[43:25] most most bitcoiners I've talked to have
[43:28] had some kind of a shitcoin phase right
[43:31] my shitcoin phase wasn't
[43:34] really um it it was never like a a super
[43:40] like Yay this token is is better than
[43:42] Bitcoin type of phase but it was more
[43:45] like
[43:46] um okay like I personally don't see like
[43:51] what this adds on top of Bitcoin but if
[43:55] if some people I I obviously still
[43:57] believe in a free market so I'm like if
[43:59] if some people think this is better than
[44:02] Bitcoin then they're free to do so and I
[44:06] still kind of think that but um um
[44:10] initially I thought it more from like a
[44:12] a business perspective like we we would
[44:16] have more clients if we obviously
[44:18] branched out
[44:20] to shitcoins to provide support for
[44:23] shitcoins um but but then I started
[44:27] thinking of it more as a as a mission
[44:30] like a moral Mission like I don't want
[44:32] to associate myself with anything that
[44:35] has no future right that that type of
[44:37] thing like I want to I want to build
[44:40] from the beginning on something that has
[44:42] a future and it's a bit contradictory
[44:46] because I um we we do have plans on
[44:49] supporting like stable coins that are
[44:51] built on top of
[44:53] Bitcoin um but this I think is like
[44:57] um I would say that this is this is more
[45:01] in favor of Bitcoin than than people
[45:04] usually
[45:05] realize um
[45:08] because yeah like you said we're we're
[45:11] still so early like Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[45:14] is nowhere close to being a currency
[45:18] that you even would want to spend like
[45:21] okay I spent some Bitcoin last night at
[45:23] the Helsinki Bitcoin Meetup but that was
[45:25] like s EUR or something for Price uh but
[45:29] it's it's not like I want to spend
[45:31] Bitcoin to live because I want to I want
[45:34] to keep my Bitcoin right so it's like
[45:37] obviously you can do spend and replace
[45:39] like hey I have
[45:41] Bitcoin and then if I buy something for
[45:44] a th000 bucks then I just buy you know a
[45:47] th000 bucks worth of bitcoin but that's
[45:49] just that that becomes like maybe a bit
[45:52] too complicated like why not just when
[45:55] you get your money in Euros or whatever
[45:57] why don't just spend that money that
[45:59] month on living expenses and then put a
[46:02] part the part of it that would have been
[46:05] over into Bitcoin like it's just it's
[46:07] just an unnecessary step for most people
[46:09] because they receive their money in in
[46:11] Fiat and then you know it's it's kind of
[46:16] easier to just spend the part of the
[46:18] Fiat you want to spend and put the rest
[46:19] into Bitcoin then then to put everything
[46:22] into Bitcoin and then you know spend the
[46:25] bit coin and replace it at a later
[46:28] date um and I still believe like
[46:33] um because we're so early there's going
[46:36] to
[46:37] be probably like you said 10 20 30 40 50
[46:43] years that a large part of the
[46:46] population still wants dollars still
[46:49] wants
[46:50] Euros um but I I think the the key is to
[46:54] start moving toward WS the Bitcoin
[46:56] Direction slowly like you don't we don't
[46:59] even want the Bitcoin Revolution to
[47:01] happen like this because that's just
[47:03] that's not that's not good it Bitcoin is
[47:07] is still technically very early uh there
[47:10] are still technically issues to solve
[47:13] like we want it to happen gradually we
[47:16] want it to happen slowly over time where
[47:18] it's like a instead
[47:20] of like a good metaphor I don't know who
[47:23] said this maybe sailor uh but uh
[47:26] like if you're in a sinking ship you
[47:28] don't want the ship to sink like this
[47:30] because no one has time to get out right
[47:32] you want it to kind of sink slowly so
[47:34] that everyone has time to get into the
[47:36] lifeboats Lifeboat in this case
[47:38] obviously is Bitcoin you don't want to
[47:40] you don't want it to happen too rapidly
[47:43] too too radically you want it to be like
[47:45] a a slower transition and that's where I
[47:47] believe like stable coins on top of
[47:50] Bitcoin is a is a huge next step like
[47:53] start moving people towards the Bitcoin
[47:56] ecosystem towards Bitcoin products
[47:59] basically putting them closer to bitcoin
[48:01] lowering the barrier of people getting
[48:03] into Bitcoin by also
[48:07] moving like taking them away from the
[48:09] the Fiat pure Fiat infrastructure like
[48:12] Banks so like I was talking talking
[48:14] about free instant transactions
[48:17] anywhere I believe that's that's like a
[48:20] a great incentive of um of moving people
[48:25] to to a more Bitcoin uh Bitcoin uh
[48:28] Centric uh Financial system um like for
[48:31] example I was uh uh I was uh I don't
[48:35] know if you've heard about the Apple
[48:36] Vision Pro yeah yeah uh so I was uh I
[48:40] was buying uh one of them with with my
[48:42] friend in the states um I'm going to
[48:45] bring it to to Finland to try out
[48:48] because uh I'm I'm a Big Apple fan uh
[48:52] but um so I was trying to send money to
[48:54] my friend in the States um we were a bit
[48:57] too late on the coordination you know
[48:59] just a couple hours
[49:01] before uh before purchasing it and
[49:04] obviously we realized hey I I can't I
[49:06] can't send money to you in the states
[49:07] that fast luckily had a credit card but
[49:10] um you know that those type of things
[49:13] that they're they're just so so annoying
[49:15] like people especially Our Generation
[49:18] younger people they they just were used
[49:21] to like stuff happening fast we we want
[49:24] stuff to happen fast and we we don't
[49:26] want we don't want all this hassle like
[49:28] all these barriers like me sending money
[49:30] I need an a number rooting number name
[49:33] address like
[49:35] this irrelevant like I don't want to do
[49:37] I don't want to do all that and I don't
[49:39] want to
[49:40] pay one or two% per transaction to send
[49:43] money to my friend in the states and I
[49:44] don't want it to take two to five
[49:46] business days I want it to be fast I
[49:49] want it to be instant and I want it to
[49:51] be free that's like the optimal case and
[49:53] I can do it with Bitcoin sure but I
[49:55] can't do it with dollars and dollars
[49:58] Apple doesn't unfortunately Apple
[49:59] doesn't accept Bitcoin yet so you kind
[50:02] of need the dollar side so that's that's
[50:05] like what I think is a is a big big next
[50:08] step in the in the coming like 5 to 10
[50:12] years three to 3 to five five to 10
[50:14] years is starting to move the Fiat
[50:17] infrastructure on
[50:19] bitcoin um and then kind of letting it
[50:22] melt on top of Bitcoin like I see you
[50:24] know Fe bitcoiners usually say Fiat is
[50:26] like a melting Ice
[50:28] Cube um but but now the problem is that
[50:31] the melting Ice Cube
[50:32] is like okay let's say you have you have
[50:35] two glasses of water um you you have the
[50:39] traditional banking system is is one
[50:41] glass and then Bitcoin is another now
[50:44] the the melting Ice Cube which is Fiat
[50:45] is in the
[50:46] traditional traditional glass here and
[50:49] it's going to melt and it's going to
[50:51] produce water like that there's still
[50:53] some economic value in it
[50:56] um and there's still some like people
[50:59] using it so do we want the The Ice Cube
[51:02] to melt into the traditional system or
[51:04] do we want it to melt into the Bitcoin
[51:06] glass and and like grow Bitcoin at the
[51:09] same time and I think that the second
[51:11] option is is better you want it
[51:14] to you want it to sort of melt in with
[51:18] Bitcoin and help Bitcoin grow as well
[51:21] yeah I think uh this this rooting for
[51:25] for uh the Fiat system to collapse like
[51:29] in the next two years
[51:32] uh this is like I can imagine happening
[51:36] fast like I can imagine the fear system
[51:39] really
[51:40] collapsing really fast if something
[51:42] happens like if people all of this like
[51:45] there can always be a Black Swamp and
[51:47] the economics effects on that would be
[51:51] tremendous the whole financial system
[51:54] the whole breakdown of trust in
[51:58] everything um let's let's let's make it
[52:02] an a good Bridge from Fiat to bitcoin
[52:06] and I think this would be uh way better
[52:10] because um when everything breaks down
[52:13] really fast it could be uh not a good
[52:17] years I mean Bitcoin does not care like
[52:20] it it's Bitcoin will succeed in the long
[52:22] run I think even if the Fiat system
[52:24] breaks down tomorrow
[52:26] uh or the field break system breaks down
[52:28] in 100 years um but I think a
[52:33] slow uh peaceful Revolution going on
[52:37] over multiple years and this also goes
[52:39] back in Low Time preference uh we also
[52:42] should have low time preference when it
[52:45] comes to adopting Bitcoin in a sense uh
[52:49] and that's why I also when when friends
[52:52] or family come up to me I don't
[52:54] understand this bit coin I don't like
[52:56] and I'm like okay you will be in the
[52:59] late majority it's okay for me if
[53:01] everybody is in the early majority uh
[53:04] then I cannot stack so many sets it's
[53:08] like it's it's we we also need people
[53:12] adopting Bitcoin in in 40 years uh maybe
[53:16] maybe not that late but let's see how
[53:18] the timing goes but uh it's okay for me
[53:21] like I stopped uh convincing everybody
[53:24] I'm just there everybody to to get
[53:26] educated I have the podcast with five
[53:29] episodes each week with interesting
[53:31] guests with different perspectives uh
[53:34] I'm always open like everybody in my
[53:36] family everybody on on on X can just uh
[53:40] text me call me whatever and say hey uh
[53:43] can can I learn this about Bitcoin let's
[53:45] jump on a call like I always do that
[53:47] because I think we have a mission to
[53:49] educate but I will not force anybody in
[53:52] Bitcoin it's not helpful for Bitcoin
[53:55] and we don't have any hectic or any
[53:58] stress to do
[54:00] so yeah so um we are coming slowly to
[54:04] the the end of the podcast and we have
[54:06] an interesting end routine in the
[54:08] podcast where the previous guest asks a
[54:10] question for the next guest uh and your
[54:13] question from the previous guest is if
[54:16] you had to sell half of your Bitcoin
[54:20] what would you
[54:22] buy h that's a tough question yes um I I
[54:28] cannot even imagine selling half a
[54:31] Bitcoin yeah I would probably at this
[54:34] point I would I would invest it back
[54:36] into into
[54:38] Zelo because that's what like I I don't
[54:41] see myself doing anything else than than
[54:44] uh advancing Bitcoin at this point like
[54:47] I don't I don't think
[54:49] there's there's anything more
[54:51] interesting than I could be doing like I
[54:55] just can't like I don't know once you
[54:58] once you see something so clearly like I
[55:02] see
[55:04] Bitcoin there's not really anything else
[55:06] you want to do like that's what
[55:09] you and I'm I'm sure you feel the same
[55:11] way like once you once you get it you
[55:15] can't let go if I if I would be uh
[55:19] forced to sell my Bitcoin I would either
[55:21] buy Bitcoin miners invest in some uh uh
[55:25] um education or invest in yourself in
[55:27] some way like the different ways
[55:29] depending on which life stage you are or
[55:32] investing in your uh business like maybe
[55:35] I would just like take like a approach
[55:37] where I buy some Bitcoin Miners and or
[55:40] buy some ads for the podcast so more
[55:43] people see Bitcoin education like there
[55:46] are so much things uh I could do with
[55:49] that money but my answer will always be
[55:51] I will buy something in the Bitcoin
[55:54] ecosystem
[55:55] like something with Bitcoin as you said
[55:57] with your own business it would be an
[56:00] interesting good idea also and then uh
[56:03] Samuel thank you for for being on and uh
[56:06] I hope we can uh make a second round in
[56:09] in some amount of time absolutely thank
[56:11] you very much Robin it's been a
