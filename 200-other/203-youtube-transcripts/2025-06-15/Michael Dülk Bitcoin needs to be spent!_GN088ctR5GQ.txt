[00:00] Bitcoin needs to be spend as well that
[00:01] we get that adoption point then we can
[00:04] get to a point where we actually get rid
[00:06] of the Fiat system oned over 100
[00:08] Merchants so far and trying hard to to
[00:10] get 500 to 1,000 this year could
[00:12] actually be the end all be all money
[00:15] most of these project will die since
[00:16] lightning is STS we've got that massive
[00:19] growth of transactions this could be
[00:20] such a massive trigger event for Bitcoin
[00:23] adoption we need to orange pill
[00:24] Merchants to send the message You Can Be
[00:26] Your Own Boss when it comes to your
[00:27] money
[00:32] why is it important for for Bitcoin to
[00:35] not only be a store of value because
[00:37] then we don't need any medium of
[00:39] exchange things but why is it important
[00:41] to use it also as a currency also as
[00:43] actual money as a medium of exchange
[00:46] well from our perspective you know
[00:48] Bitcoin was made as a peer-to-peer cash
[00:50] Network you know so that was the the the
[00:52] the idea of it behind and through to
[00:54] lightning this makes it now 100% usable
[00:57] what I believe or what we believe uh to
[00:59] really send Bitcoin from a person a to a
[01:02] person B without a lot of fees with
[01:04] instant payment settlement as well as no
[01:06] chargebacks um and this works like cash
[01:09] in the end but just digital so um from
[01:12] our perspective it's really important
[01:13] also for the Bitcoin ecosystem uh that
[01:16] payments are done on the lightning
[01:18] Network because obviously it's like um
[01:20] with water you know if water is not
[01:21] running or it's not flowing there will
[01:23] be bacterials uh bacterias and the same
[01:25] is with with with money so if everyone
[01:27] just sits on their money and it's not
[01:29] getting spent it's just losing value and
[01:31] it's getting ill so um we believe
[01:33] Merchant adoption as well as Bitcoin
[01:35] adoption comes from paying with it as
[01:37] well obviously there's a good good thing
[01:39] about hooding you know um but you can
[01:41] wait for better times but you can also
[01:43] just put 2000 euros um dollars on your
[01:46] lightning wallet and just help the
[01:48] ecosystem grow and that's why why we
[01:51] believe lightning payments are very
[01:52] important for Bitcoin from an adoption
[01:54] point of view that's uh that's really
[01:56] cool um do you think that as you also
[01:59] orange bu Merchants as you're also in
[02:01] contact with them do you think that
[02:03] first there's the merchant adoption
[02:05] generally I mean I mean both come
[02:07] together at the same time to a certain
[02:09] extent but is is the merchant adoption
[02:12] or the consumer adoption first is like
[02:14] the merchant adopting because consumer
[02:16] asking for it or is like consumer using
[02:18] it because it's accepted at the merchant
[02:20] store well it's a hand and act problem I
[02:22] believe you know because obviously we
[02:24] can orange pill private individuals
[02:26] that's what we I believe you and me are
[02:28] doing anyway in our with our friends and
[02:29] family but just imagine when you've got
[02:32] a merchant who also got maybe like
[02:34] Bitcoin accepted stickers around and is
[02:36] obviously meeting people on a daily
[02:37] basis more than we maybe do because
[02:39] we've got not like a customer facing job
[02:42] uh face tof face job on a daily basis
[02:44] where we might be able also to orang
[02:46] people Merchants H sorry consumers um
[02:49] that's a very good thing for Bitcoin
[02:51] because it's like advertisement for for
[02:52] Bitcoin on a daily basis people can see
[02:55] the Bitcoin logo it gets normal for them
[02:58] you know they it becomes part of their
[02:59] normal day to see Bitcoin Bitcoin signs
[03:02] to be able to pay in Bitcoin and that
[03:04] might help the situation maybe for
[03:06] people who are not
[03:08] really easy to orange pill from a friend
[03:10] perspective or from an online learning
[03:12] perspective to see it in real life to
[03:14] make it tangible for them that's also
[03:16] why we brought out our lightning
[03:18] terminal um post device because when you
[03:20] look um how the merchants are working
[03:22] with it you know because when you
[03:24] download an app and accept Bitcoin
[03:25] payments there's no stickers or
[03:27] something involved there's no buying
[03:28] from the merchant so there's no really a
[03:30] need from for for him to do anything
[03:33] else when we when we decided to bring
[03:36] out our po device know we really thought
[03:38] to have like an easy solution for not
[03:40] just the merchant but also the employees
[03:42] to that they have got fun accepting
[03:44] Bitcoin payments it should be easy it
[03:46] should be understandable and um that was
[03:49] our goal when we when we created opo
[03:53] interesting when you talk with Merchants
[03:55] what what what are the usual like push
[03:57] backs or like things that you get from
[03:59] them they're like oh no we we we don't
[04:01] want to accept Bitcoin because of XX
[04:04] reasons well I think that also depends
[04:07] on on on where you are based you know
[04:08] from Germany I can speak from a German
[04:10] perspective you know they're really you
[04:12] know Germans they they like to invest
[04:14] not very risky so they like like old
[04:16] investment methods and Bitcoin used to
[04:19] be or like they heard lots of bad bad
[04:21] news or in television they said were
[04:23] scam scam Stuff Etc so that's why we
[04:26] also thought
[04:27] let's create that or let's build that
[04:29] compy in Germany with German legislation
[04:31] the German gmbh because we've got
[04:33] obviously um yeah regulations and laws
[04:36] to follow and um I believe when we when
[04:39] we follow these laws in Germany we can
[04:40] we are able to to follow them everywhere
[04:42] because Germany's very bureaucrat has
[04:44] got a very bureaucratic State and or is
[04:47] a very very bureaucracy State and um I
[04:50] believe when we can make it here we can
[04:52] make it everywhere um but a merchant
[04:54] obviously needs more than just knowing
[04:56] that um they've got a good good partner
[04:58] for accepting bitco payments it's about
[05:00] also what advantages brings Bitcoin out
[05:02] of them so there's brings out for them
[05:05] so obviously it's instant payment
[05:07] settlement it's no chargebacks but also
[05:09] the possibility to to to get new
[05:11] customer new customers let's say te
[05:13] techy and younger customers Tech say
[05:16] younger customers um who might be
[05:18] visiting their shop soon so that's
[05:20] really marketing vehicle for them now to
[05:23] accept Bitcoin payments to address new
[05:25] uh customers as well and that's what we
[05:26] really try to tell them that they've got
[05:28] possibilities to accept Bitcoin without
[05:31] much hustle you know it's just our
[05:32] device which costs one time 99 and then
[05:35] you just pay 1% transaction fee and
[05:38] included this the whole reporting from a
[05:40] CSV and PDF perspective as well as coin
[05:43] tracking to then um send all the
[05:45] transactions in one report to the tax
[05:47] consultant um so that's also a service
[05:49] what we offer within within our within
[05:51] our um within our offering with with
[05:55] Wago just that we have like this one one
[05:58] solution for the merchant who might get
[06:00] up at 6:00 a.m. to to open a shop or
[06:02] maybe prepare food and close it at at
[06:04] 10: p.m. um for cleaning it and there's
[06:06] not really time for running a note or
[06:09] doing anything really Tech deeply so we
[06:12] really try to take that that that um
[06:15] from them and really just give them an
[06:16] easy solution to accept cheap fast
[06:19] payments and um after showing them I
[06:22] believe or when we show them you know
[06:25] it's always not too difficult to sell
[06:27] from my perspective we onboarded over
[06:29] 100 merch so far and uh we're really
[06:31] trying hard to to get 500 to 1,000 this
[06:34] year that's our Target for this year and
[06:37] yeah I think it's more obviously Bitcoin
[06:39] is
[06:40] getting yeah into the news Etc it helps
[06:43] us even more to orange pill merchants in
[06:45] the end of the
[06:47] day you mentioned the marketing uh value
[06:51] for merchand I feel like that's really
[06:52] an a good argument all for merchant
[06:54] because you can see like there's the
[06:55] Bitcoin map and the other apps where you
[06:57] can see like who is accepting Bitcoin
[06:59] and if more more people are in Bitcoin
[07:01] and they actually like oh I'm I'm today
[07:03] in like I don't know in Italy let's see
[07:05] if there's any Merchant that accepts
[07:07] Bitcoin and then I go to this restaurant
[07:09] first like the marketing argument is a
[07:12] really good one is that the main
[07:14] argument that like usually get helps the
[07:17] the merchant to accept it or is like are
[07:19] better Arguments for them to accept it
[07:21] well that's one of of the arguments
[07:23] another one obviously is when we orange
[07:24] pillar Merchant and we obviously try our
[07:27] best from our side to to to to make news
[07:29] about that new Merchant on different
[07:31] channels like telegram ster news Twitter
[07:33] faceb not Facebook LinkedIn for example
[07:36] and just to to send a m message that
[07:38] there's a new place to spend Bitcoin and
[07:40] just orange built a burger bar in Just
[07:42] near Munich and I think that's two weeks
[07:44] ago and they had sales in Bitcoin on a
[07:47] daily basis since then so there were
[07:49] it's really nice to see that people from
[07:50] Munich go to that small it's not a
[07:52] village but it's called haking it's also
[07:55] famous football club is from there but
[07:56] it's not in in the main CI so people
[07:58] still need to go there um they do it so
[08:01] it's really nice to see that this
[08:03] Merchants really got payments on a daily
[08:04] basis so far and we're really trying to
[08:07] give them even more support than with
[08:08] advertisement and maybe going there with
[08:10] a Bitcoin Meetup as well to then push
[08:12] that further even since how long are you
[08:15] uh orange billing or trying to Orange
[08:17] bilding Merchants so personally you know
[08:19] before we started with opo I think I've
[08:22] started personally doing that I think
[08:23] three years ago um that was also one
[08:26] reason why I then came together with the
[08:28] others and uh we built Pago together
[08:31] because we really wanted to have a easy
[08:33] solution to make it even more easy you
[08:34] know for me it was just like a a free
[08:36] time thing to do when I go out to have
[08:38] food just to ask if I can pay in Bitcoin
[08:40] yeah I really thought why why not then
[08:44] building a startup together and really
[08:46] build a solution which is fast easy and
[08:48] secure for merchant to accept Bitcoin
[08:50] payments and that was our goal and is it
[08:52] still yeah do you see um um when when I
[08:55] talk with other Bitcoin companies uh
[08:57] they like I see it with my my few counts
[09:00] I see it with the Bitcoin companies that
[09:02] I talk to uh no matter if it's a Bitcoin
[09:05] exchange or Hardware wallet provider
[09:07] anything like that they always say the
[09:09] same thing when the the price moves no
[09:12] matter if it's up or down the sales
[09:14] actually go up uh and it's like if it's
[09:16] stagnant the sales are kind of like flat
[09:19] do you also see that in like Bitcoin as
[09:22] medium exchange use case and also in
[09:24] like adopting new merchants and adopting
[09:26] new Bitcoin accepted here we could say
[09:29] yes but I think that's from a obviously
[09:31] from a news perspective you know Bitcoin
[09:33] goes up we've got more news more people
[09:34] can read in the newspaper here about it
[09:36] but when you look from a payment
[09:38] perspective I think the merchant looks
[09:40] into it a bit longer than just making a
[09:41] few bucks on a trade for example so you
[09:44] obviously Implement that solution not
[09:46] for like a short cycle of three months
[09:48] or something so we really try to really
[09:51] onboard the merchant that it might
[09:52] obviously go down a little bit but will
[09:54] we now started as well but we've got a
[09:56] partnership with bring in to then have
[09:58] also merchants will say say look I would
[10:01] be fine to accept Bitcoin but I cannot
[10:03] have Bitcoin in my in my in my company
[10:05] company sheet um I would like to receive
[10:07] Euros so um there's some some Merchants
[10:10] they would like to receive Bitcoin would
[10:13] like to receive Euro due to the fact
[10:14] that we obviously still have these these
[10:17] these uh ups and downs in Bitcoin and
[10:19] there's some some Industries for example
[10:21] like gas stations or like let's say news
[10:24] agencies where they sell tabac products
[10:27] tobacco products with like high taxes on
[10:29] they're not able to have that price
[10:31] difference so they really would like to
[10:34] offramp then to have that not anymore so
[10:36] that's also something um to think about
[10:39] for merchant when it goes down and they
[10:41] really think obviously we need to have
[10:44] uh our numbers right we can't make any
[10:45] losses then to really switch then to
[10:48] maybe feat offering during that time and
[10:50] then change it so we really offer the
[10:52] Poss the merchant to then decide how
[10:54] much of the incoming payment will be
[10:55] offr and how much will be staying in
[10:57] Bitcoin so the merchant can decide for
[10:59] example example when he receives 100 in
[11:01] Bitcoin that 80 go to his lightning
[11:03] wallet and €20 will be offr to his zipa
[11:06] account and that's just something we try
[11:08] to offer them then obviously to have the
[11:11] whole yeah the whole spectrum of
[11:13] possibilities for their for their
[11:14] business to to operate um still within
[11:17] the
[11:18] economics it's interesting another
[11:21] question more holistic uh approach do
[11:24] you think when we look at now Bitcoin we
[11:26] have so many different almost payment
[11:29] options we have so many different monies
[11:31] even in the world like almost every
[11:33] country has his own currency of course
[11:35] there are a lot of countries that just
[11:37] have the US dollar also even though they
[11:38] are not the United States um do you
[11:41] think that we come to an a world where
[11:44] there's only Bitcoin and with that also
[11:46] for payment is it's quite interesting
[11:49] because it's a protocol like Bitcoin and
[11:51] lightning that's just protocol so even
[11:53] if there are different clients and
[11:54] different things they're still still
[11:56] accepted to one each other so that would
[11:59] be
[11:59] would be amazing to have that um do you
[12:02] think that we get into this like
[12:05] Singularity world where there's just one
[12:07] money at some point obviously it's a
[12:09] long way down the road but uh do you do
[12:11] do you have some framework to think
[12:13] about that well from my perspective you
[12:15] know just from a mic perspective because
[12:17] I canot cannot or we cannot change the
[12:19] whole world you know we try just because
[12:20] we believe Bitcoin is the best money
[12:23] available right now you know we've all
[12:25] seen what happens to US dollar or Euro
[12:28] after certain circumstance St is like Co
[12:30] or something else and I just believe you
[12:32] know
[12:33] Bitcoin is a very good good thing what
[12:36] we what we what we have these days or
[12:38] like the best thing we have from a techn
[12:40] techn technic technical point of view
[12:42] MoneyWise and I believe one day everyone
[12:44] will will find will realize but I think
[12:47] it's a long way till there then because
[12:48] we've got lobbyism we've got different
[12:50] things pushing into that adoption and
[12:53] obviously it's open source as well so
[12:55] what I found out it's obviously because
[12:57] it's open source and decentralized there
[12:58] not that Big Marketing Al together to
[13:02] push that if you look for example to
[13:03] Solana they've got that big Solana
[13:05] Foundation they've got loads of money
[13:06] they can push it really hard that's why
[13:08] we have that within four years we have
[13:10] them as high and there's a it's a big
[13:12] competition in my eyes to bitcoin
[13:14] because obviously Solana pay they
[13:16] they've got more money as well as more
[13:18] marketing budget to then send a message
[13:20] to Merchants to accept Solana and I
[13:22] believe it's better for for merchants to
[13:24] accept Bitcoin lightning um what we've
[13:26] seen is that other coins start to make
[13:28] Atomic SWAT Atomic swaps to bitcoin
[13:30] lightning so it's possible to pay
[13:32] lightning invoices with other other
[13:34] coins as well but that's something we
[13:36] cannot change for us it's important that
[13:39] our Merchants receive Bitcoin lightning
[13:41] or if they desire Euro or Fiat because
[13:44] they have to but our advice would also
[13:46] always be to the merchant to keep
[13:48] Bitcoin within their balance sheet
[13:50] because it's some kind of saving saving
[13:52] um for them um in the business for the
[13:55] future and they will also be able to
[13:56] spend this Bitcoin then for obviously
[13:59] needs in their company as well so um but
[14:04] in the end of the day you know I'm not I
[14:05] can I cannot you know the glass glass
[14:08] ball you know I cannot look in the
[14:10] future I just believe it's the it's the
[14:12] it's it's the best thing available right
[14:14] now from a from a money perspective and
[14:17] it will win in the end of the
[14:19] day yeah I also think so and it's
[14:21] interesting uh I just got today a text
[14:24] of a friend of my dad and and he was
[14:26] like oh Robin I just wanted to ask you
[14:28] about the sun coin I'm like what what is
[14:31] that again and then I looked in the
[14:33] website looked at the videos and they're
[14:34] like oh yeah it's an obvious scam like
[14:37] that's so obvious but the people don't
[14:39] get that like people are like oh it's
[14:40] Innovative it's blockchain it's it's
[14:42] fascinating it's h so many scams out
[14:45] there but but I when some people always
[14:47] ask me is it's also possible to use
[14:49] other cryptocurrencies to to pay with
[14:51] upu but why is the other
[14:53] cryptocurrencies and you know from my
[14:55] perspective you know I've been in
[14:57] Bitcoin since 2016 and obviously there
[14:59] were other coins built afterwards to
[15:02] then maybe go into that that there's
[15:03] just seven transactions on the main
[15:05] chain
[15:06] possible with Bitcoin but du to Layer
[15:09] Two now there will be so much projects
[15:12] there's just no need for it anymore
[15:13] because lightning makes it makes it very
[15:16] yeah makes it makes it finish for us you
[15:18] know we've got that store of value with
[15:20] the biggest Market volume that
[15:21] decentralized good money and we've got
[15:23] the possibility now to use it like cash
[15:25] actually it's there it's just very very
[15:29] good you know and there's no external
[15:31] influence on it who can actually do much
[15:34] about it you know obviously if you look
[15:35] into centralized coins we never know
[15:38] what happens is there is there is there
[15:39] any more hidden somewhere you never know
[15:41] and that's something I wouldn't rely on
[15:43] if I would be a
[15:44] consumer yeah it's it's they they showed
[15:48] some some some table was like oh Bitcoin
[15:50] is that and really bad but just be aware
[15:54] of scams I I feel like I I have to say
[15:57] it every once in a while in in in a
[15:59] Bitcoin podcast um it's it's interesting
[16:01] how you how you frame it do you think
[16:03] that lightning will remove any use case
[16:07] for any altcoins when when you basically
[16:09] have the most secure network then you
[16:11] can build layer twos and layer threes
[16:13] you we even have like the runes we have
[16:15] the ordinals we have all all those how
[16:17] do you called tap group assets there are
[16:19] so many different things that the nfts
[16:21] all this uh altcoin things we can also
[16:24] now build on on top of Bitcoin does
[16:27] lightning just lightning or Layer Two
[16:29] Solutions in general completely
[16:31] eliminate any use case for altcoins well
[16:35] that's a difficult one because obviously
[16:37] lightning is a payment rail you know
[16:39] it's a payment protocol so definitely
[16:41] there needs also be more work to be done
[16:43] you know so um lightning isn't finished
[16:46] yet you know there's still work to do
[16:47] but from a current perspective I believe
[16:49] there won't be a need for any altcoins
[16:52] in the future I know obviously there's
[16:53] different asset managers would use other
[16:56] blockchains to issue tokens or something
[16:58] but that
[16:59] something obviously it's up to them you
[17:02] know I really look into that from a
[17:04] payment perspective you know I've always
[17:06] been interested in payments how is it
[17:08] possible to get money from A to B on the
[17:10] very efficient way that's what I'm
[17:12] looking into also but from a consumer
[17:14] perspective when I receed the money how
[17:16] much is it worth so obviously and
[17:19] Bitcoin doesn't have that loss of value
[17:21] over time which I might have with any
[17:24] altcoin uh and that's why I believe in
[17:28] the end of day most of these project
[17:30] will die obviously if there's some
[17:32] altcoins that get used by big big
[17:34] players big companies to obviously
[17:36] deploy tokens or maybe nfts then they
[17:38] might live A bit longer but I I think
[17:41] the the brighter mass will also or like
[17:42] big companies will use lightning just to
[17:44] have internal payments between for
[17:46] example Africa and America within a
[17:48] company to make that cheaper as well so
[17:51] um I think that's the future of payments
[17:53] yeah absolutely yeah I think it's always
[17:56] fascinating that like like bit coin is
[17:59] still here even though it was attacked
[18:00] so many times and there's no like
[18:03] centralized company the founder SOI
[18:06] nakot left so early on like it was like
[18:10] not even in a like he said like oh it's
[18:13] ready but it was really early like
[18:15] really small still back then um even now
[18:18] it's kind of early and kind of small
[18:20] still but it's it's fascinating that
[18:23] this this idea is so powerful of
[18:25] decentralized money that people are
[18:27] willing to fight for it for7 like I now
[18:30] my whole life evolves around Bitcoin I
[18:34] do from Monday to Sunday every day like
[18:37] between 8 to 10 hours work for Bitcoin
[18:40] sometimes 12 to 14 uh it's it's it's
[18:42] fascinating how this this this system or
[18:45] how this how this powerful idea this
[18:48] attractive idea like sucks you in and
[18:50] then you really want to get involved in
[18:52] in that and it's also like really
[18:54] fascinating like you also work now 24
[18:56] like 24/7 but uh full-time Bitcoin right
[18:59] yes so yeah but obviously I come from a
[19:02] fat fat job perspective so last my last
[19:05] job was actually selling anti-money
[19:06] laundry software to Big Banks so I
[19:08] really come out of the Fiat Fiat
[19:10] perspective as well um but working in
[19:13] Bitcoin really changed a lot for me also
[19:14] meeting very interesting people
[19:17] obviously creating a new product which
[19:19] maybe helps sending the message about
[19:21] Bitcoin adoption to to Merchants you
[19:23] know and I just believe it's a good
[19:26] we're very early obviously but also I
[19:27] think it's good if you work in Bitcoin
[19:29] um because there will be more jobs in
[19:31] the future for example so I think for
[19:33] everyone who's interested in in maybe
[19:35] getting a Bitcoin job one day is I think
[19:37] it's not bad to already start networking
[19:40] with obviously different startups
[19:41] different companies because there will
[19:43] be jobs there will be loads in the
[19:44] future and I think it's a good thing
[19:47] good thing to invest your time in
[19:48] especially when you get it paid or if
[19:50] it's your job obviously then it's even
[19:52] even better really cool yeah you you
[19:54] worked in AML uh before and like AML KC
[19:58] is always an in Topic in in in Bitcoin
[20:01] how do you see uh like all the the KCs
[20:04] that's going on I mean there's like you
[20:07] can obviously buy Bitcoin right now just
[20:09] like non kyc like from a friend
[20:12] basically I I could visit you and give
[20:14] you like a 100 euros and you just like
[20:16] transfer me some some Bitcoin that's
[20:17] like something easy to do uh easy but
[20:20] that's like way harder to do than just
[20:22] buying on Exchange what's your like
[20:25] opinion on on like KC EML and all all
[20:27] those those things well obviously from
[20:29] there's two opinions you know I think
[20:31] you know Bitcoin was made for privacy
[20:34] you know so that's one big thing about
[20:35] Bitcoin but also you know thing was Fiat
[20:38] was there before Bitcoin and there was
[20:40] already laws and regulations about AML
[20:42] kyc before we really started using
[20:44] Bitcoin as a form of payment or
[20:46] somewhere people thought we need now
[20:47] need KC or something so personally I
[20:50] don't I wouldn't do it as if it wouldn't
[20:54] be there I would would appreciate it but
[20:56] obviously there's the regulator who says
[20:57] look people if if you would like to to
[20:59] to um to have Bitcoin you have to do a
[21:01] kyc process and that's something I
[21:03] cannot decide and cannot change either
[21:05] what I can just do is to really um still
[21:09] do the best to send the message that
[21:10] Bitcoin is still a good thing you know
[21:12] because I if there will be KC we have to
[21:15] do it you know and I just believe I
[21:17] wouldn't I don't want Bitcoin to to to
[21:19] be stopped let's say I don't want
[21:21] Bitcoin to to die due to the fact that
[21:23] no that there that there's kyc in place
[21:25] now you know so from my perspective I'm
[21:28] not a big of
[21:29] kyc but I wouldn't mind doing it if this
[21:32] helps Bitcoin
[21:34] adoption as you worked in there and it's
[21:37] interesting for me because I had some
[21:39] people that also worked in KC and and
[21:41] AML and tried to do all those things uh
[21:44] before in the fear jop and and they kind
[21:46] of all said to me like it does not
[21:49] really like they they're filling out a
[21:51] lot of documents but they don't do a lot
[21:53] with that uh and and the KC and AML is
[21:56] like more like it's just bureaucracy and
[21:58] like even even if they have some things
[22:01] they don't really like is was it also
[22:03] your um observation that like it's a lot
[22:06] of filling out forms and filling out
[22:08] documents and then the documents just
[22:10] get older and nobody touches them
[22:12] anymore well from my perspective I was
[22:13] in charge selling like really software
[22:15] packages like say a whole AML solution
[22:17] to a big bank so obviously that there's
[22:19] different things to be looked at you
[22:21] know there's sanction lists there's
[22:23] lists of people who might be politically
[22:25] exposed and if there's transaction
[22:27] incoming you need to have checks to
[22:30] these lists as well as to different
[22:31] other things and that was mostly what I
[22:33] was doing before um obviously it was
[22:36] European and swits Banks but now it's
[22:39] with Bitcoin you know I think also
[22:40] Bitcoin isn't a really good tool for
[22:42] money laundry as well so obviously if
[22:44] you looked into that you know there's
[22:45] software available already to really
[22:47] Trace that back Trace payments back
[22:49] obviously if you if you use some kind of
[22:51] mixer or something but that's also with
[22:53] the real world money laundering is more
[22:54] you try to launder is more money you
[22:56] will lose of it you know obviously so as
[22:58] more you mix the money as more fees you
[23:00] will have due to the mixing so um I just
[23:02] think it's not a good thing not a good
[23:04] tool for for money laundry as well and
[23:07] so it's getting used for it obviously
[23:09] but that will be less and I think
[23:10] obviously the US dollar is being used
[23:12] more for money money laundry in the end
[23:13] of the day so that's not an excuse for
[23:16] for me to say Bitcoin is like uh just
[23:19] for money laundry you know obviously if
[23:21] you watch or listen to my podcast on a
[23:23] regular basis I guess you already bought
[23:26] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[23:28] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[23:32] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[23:34] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[23:36] the bit boox it's super secure it's
[23:38] simple to set up it's also perfect gift

[23:56] to bulletproof yourself cust setup your
[23:59] security setup and maybe even your
[24:01] citizenship set up you have to talk to

[24:42] personal Bitcoin exchange 21 Bitcoin
[24:45] with code Robin you get a hefty discount
[24:49] for all your purchases in the future
[24:52] yeah it's it's for me it's so this
[24:54] argument oh Bitcoin is for criminals I
[24:56] mean it kind of managed already like I
[24:59] feel like even in the mainstream Society
[25:01] it it kind of I don't hear it that much
[25:03] anymore maybe I just maybe I just buil
[25:06] my bubble out at this point so no but
[25:08] it's good I think it's good Robin you
[25:10] know because that was obviously when I
[25:12] remember back you know I had my my dad
[25:13] who who compared with the Tulip tulips
[25:15] from from Holland you know had different
[25:17] stories like you like everyone who's in
[25:18] Bitcoin a couple of years about Bitcoin
[25:20] from family and friends and stuff and I
[25:22] believe even if I'm not a big fan of
[25:25] different things I believe as more news
[25:26] we get about Bitcoin about like black
[25:29] rock as well all these different things
[25:31] it's good for Bitcoin from a news
[25:32] perspective the normal people the nocoin
[25:34] are he from it from a day-to-day
[25:36] perspective and that's important for
[25:37] Bitcoin adoption um
[25:40] so I always look at the end outcoming in
[25:44] the end of the day and that has to be
[25:45] the right thing you know obviously
[25:47] there's loads of stuff to be done on the
[25:49] way there and we cannot make it right
[25:51] for everyone but in the end of the day
[25:52] Bitcoin I I hope Bitcoin wins or I
[25:55] believe Bitcoin will win uh and there
[25:57] will be M adoption at some point
[25:58] you absolutely and I always go to this
[26:02] comparison about the my personal
[26:04] Christmas table of a big family and I
[26:07] just know that in 2019 nobody in my
[26:10] family even not even even even not even
[26:13] me was in Bitcoin and so in 2020 I was
[26:16] coming in Bitcoin so in in 2020 at the
[26:18] Christmas table I was the the one weird
[26:20] one that had Bitcoin and uh I didn't
[26:23] talk about it on the Christmas table
[26:25] because I was like kind of shy I was
[26:26] like ah I don't know if thisit like not
[26:28] that secure about Bitcoin at this point
[26:30] um but people knew that I was in Bitcoin
[26:33] and there was some talking points with
[26:35] some colleagues and there some family
[26:37] members there and then like as the years
[26:40] progressed like more and more came in
[26:42] like my dad my mom my sister um her her
[26:46] friend then my cousin like like the the
[26:49] the Christmas table if like you imagine
[26:51] like 40 50 people like first it was just
[26:53] like one guy then there like two then
[26:56] three and I feel like that's the the
[26:57] grasp movement that we have and I think
[27:00] when when people ask me like what what
[27:01] can I do to to uh progress the Bitcoin
[27:05] movement the most is like two things um
[27:09] first uh orange pill your loved ones
[27:12] orange pill your neighbors orange pill
[27:14] the people that are in your environment
[27:16] that's the true CMAs movement that we
[27:18] need and second if you pay for something
[27:21] ask if you can pay in Bitcoin and then
[27:24] obviously if they want to ask they can
[27:26] directly refer to to you as as a
[27:28] solution stuff like that but then the
[27:31] important thing is that they ask because
[27:34] imagine uh you have a merchant you never
[27:36] spoke to them uh and they had already
[27:39] like five six people before hey can can
[27:42] I uh uh pay Bitcoin and then you come in
[27:45] and say hey do you want to accept
[27:46] Bitcoin in your store then you're like
[27:48] oh yeah people ask me about that like
[27:50] how is that possible that 100% but
[27:53] that's also why we alsoo got a partner
[27:55] model in place so we've got already I
[27:57] think between 25 and 30 um yeah Partners
[28:00] who help us selling or sending the
[28:02] message towards merchants in on
[28:04] affiliate or implementation agreement
[28:06] because it's about exactly what you're
[28:08] saying it's not it's about every
[28:09] bitcoiner spending sending the message
[28:11] to Merchants and friends and family and
[28:14] for that part obviously with the
[28:15] merchants there's us and we give a very
[28:17] fair share of the transaction fee
[28:19] lifelong to the to the partners who help
[28:21] or refer us to the merchants and I
[28:23] believe that's also one key to to to
[28:25] involve bitcoiners use existing Network
[28:28] um and leverage it absolutely and then
[28:31] uh the obvious question for me is now
[28:34] when we have this CR movement more and
[28:35] more people come in how do you envision
[28:38] Bitcoin scaling obviously we have the
[28:40] lightning Network um do we need above
[28:43] that layer two solutions uh I hear a lot
[28:46] about then we need federations like fedy
[28:48] Min or ecash or Arc or other things like
[28:51] that uh how do you see like um Bitcoin
[28:54] scaling in in the future well from my
[28:56] from my perspective I told you I'm not
[28:58] too techy in in into that but I believe
[29:00] you know Layer Two you know as I said
[29:02] it's not not 100% finished yet it's
[29:04] working very good but there has to be
[29:06] stuff to be done obviously to make it
[29:07] more reliable to have it on a world
[29:10] scale used and but I believe if as soon
[29:12] as we've got more notes running more
[29:14] liquidity into the channels more people
[29:16] using it more people working on that on
[29:18] Layer Two as well that will be more
[29:20] reliable and will be will be used
[29:22] because there's from my perspective no
[29:24] need for a layer three you can use it if
[29:26] you want with a third party but in the
[29:28] end of the day we are a non-custodial
[29:30] that's what we believe what what we are
[29:31] doing um the P to really take payment in
[29:35] payment out to the merch in his
[29:36] non-custodial or custodial lightning
[29:38] wallet what he can decide and I believe
[29:41] there will be just more services like us
[29:43] you know there's already loads of other
[29:44] services where you've got just an
[29:45] application or something else and I
[29:47] don't see them as competition to be
[29:49] honest because I believe every company
[29:51] which have Merchant adoption is good so
[29:54] I would never would never really hate
[29:56] against competition you know because
[29:58] there's a use case for everything you
[29:59] know there might be Merchants who just
[30:00] need an app on their phone to accept
[30:02] Bitcoin payments but there might also be
[30:04] Merchants where the boss is not in shop
[30:06] and they need some kind of device to
[30:08] accept Bitcoins because they don't want
[30:09] to have the the C the the employee
[30:12] really build into their phone but also
[30:14] I've spoken to loads of let's say people
[30:16] who work in restaurants and stuff they
[30:17] get minimum wage and they're also not up
[30:19] to accept Bitcoin payments on their
[30:21] private phone for their boss so that's
[30:23] why we really thought as well to have a
[30:25] designated device for these payments and
[30:28] it could be stolen as well so really
[30:29] it's just a stupid stupid device to to
[30:32] to invoice um not stupid device it's a
[30:35] it's a simple device just to to invoice
[30:37] um lightning payments and it can't if
[30:40] it's lost you just get a new one put on
[30:42] your your your address your your
[30:44] lightning wallet address again and you
[30:45] can can go back to business accept
[30:48] Bitcoin payment so there's not much risk
[30:50] or something else involved if you if you
[30:53] accept Bitcoin payments with us you know
[30:55] so that's what we really um try to do
[30:58] ah really cool um how does uh actually
[31:01] when when Merchants uh will be accepted
[31:04] like they they probably ask about the
[31:06] fees like involved in in that thing how
[31:08] does uh Your solution and also the
[31:11] lightning Network non-custodial um
[31:13] compare to like credit card fees for
[31:16] merchants that's also different from a
[31:19] different uh from from from from country
[31:21] to Country in Germany there's obviously
[31:23] there's um speak from a German
[31:25] perspective maybe from an Austrian as
[31:26] well there's obviously debit cards and
[31:28] credit cards and there's these days very
[31:30] cheap fees on debit cards right now
[31:32] already possible but the Germans they
[31:34] like to use credit cards as well because
[31:36] they get cash back let's say membership
[31:37] rewards of American Express or miles and
[31:39] more with visa and that's obviously they
[31:42] want to get some the customer would like
[31:44] to get something out of it of his
[31:45] purchase in addition to to the purchase
[31:48] itself we with 1% transaction fee are
[31:51] still um I think it's fine you know this
[31:54] it could be a a little bit cheaper but
[31:55] we obviously we've got cost to run the
[31:57] node we've got
[31:58] uh legislation cost regulation cost so
[32:00] we're just about to go through the
[32:02] crypto asset Service Pro provider
[32:04] licensing with the MAA obviously that's
[32:06] everything what we need to handle right
[32:07] now but I believe obviously in the
[32:10] future when there will be when obviously
[32:12] it's cheaper for us to run the whole
[32:14] infrastructure as well then it might be
[32:16] possible to to lower fees too but right
[32:18] now I think it's very fair fair 1% to
[32:21] really accept Bitcoin payments without
[32:23] the need to to to have own inbone
[32:25] liquidity to really just to accept
[32:27] Bitcoins Bitcoin payments fast and easy
[32:29] and you don't need to run a note as well
[32:31] so that's something I believe in comes
[32:33] in the second or third step you know
[32:34] Orange Building the merchant is like it
[32:36] has to be very easy he shouldn't have
[32:38] any disadvantages out of it when you
[32:41] then talk to him the third second third
[32:43] four time after Orange Building him then
[32:45] you can speak about noncustodial you can
[32:46] tell him a little bit more about he will
[32:48] start to maybe dig into the topic as
[32:50] well um but I wouldn't really go to the
[32:52] merchant on the first date and tell him
[32:55] you have to run your own Bitcoin note
[32:57] now yeah you have to this you have to do
[32:58] that because that just makes it more
[33:01] difficult in the sales process to get
[33:03] him really accepting Bitcoin payments so
[33:05] um I believe there's a learning curve as
[33:07] well um and it has to start as easy as
[33:10] possible and then obviously more
[33:12] technical or difficult things come
[33:16] afterwards I just thought about like
[33:18] this this could be such a massive
[33:19] trigger event for Bitcoin adoption when
[33:22] we have Bitcoin accepted here more and
[33:24] more like more and more P more and more
[33:27] uh Merchant accepted people will pay
[33:30] down the merchant in Bitcoin uh even if
[33:33] they sell it immediately they know about
[33:36] Bitcoin and then they're like oh I
[33:38] accepted some Bitcoins like a year ago
[33:41] and they now double the value why did I
[33:43] not keep the Bitcoin exactly exactly but
[33:46] also from a consumer perspective you
[33:47] know there's some people who always ask
[33:49] me mik why should I pay my Bitcoin why
[33:50] should I use my Bitcoins you know
[33:52] obviously like there's one reason like
[33:54] the one reasons is what I just before
[33:56] helping the ecosystem obvious grow the
[33:58] Bitcoin Bitcoin ecosystem with spending
[34:00] Bitcoin as well but on the other hand
[34:02] let's say you've got one Bitcoin Two
[34:04] Three or 0.1 and obviously you changed
[34:07] FIA to bitcoin you paid might maybe paid
[34:09] One 1.5% for the exchange rate and then
[34:12] let's say you would like to purchase
[34:14] something you would then go back to
[34:16] purchasing back or exchanging it back to
[34:18] Fiat paying again fee for that and then
[34:21] spending my spending the field so
[34:24] obviously the ideal case would be now to
[34:25] have as much as possible solutions now
[34:29] places where then I can spend or they
[34:31] can spend their Bitcoins rather than
[34:33] exchanging back to Fiat and that's what
[34:35] we're trying to do as well obviously
[34:36] there more places there's where people
[34:38] can spend their Bitcoin it's less likely
[34:40] that there exchange it back to Fiat and
[34:43] to spended there you know because it's
[34:44] obviously you know in German Germany
[34:46] there's a sentence called H there
[34:49] obviously comes from from Trading stocks
[34:52] and but it's the same here you know
[34:53] because obviously there there an
[34:54] exchange who wants to make money and um
[34:58] there's just no need what I believe to
[34:59] exchange it again back to feeld if you
[35:01] want once have Bitcoin obviously it's a
[35:03] store of value but then obviously to
[35:05] spend it at one day as well I love it a
[35:07] lot and and then you like then we can
[35:10] get to a point where we actually get rid
[35:12] of the uh Fiat system will will be will
[35:16] be really cool um we talked a lot about
[35:19] about lightning maybe for those people
[35:21] who don't know like a high level
[35:23] explanation why is it important and what
[35:26] what what is it so what we at opo are
[35:28] doing we actually run our note it's also
[35:31] deployed in kubernetes as well to
[35:33] actually be the middleman let's say
[35:35] Abacus you might know Abacus from from
[35:37] your math um times in school so actually
[35:40] we're just sitting there and we move one
[35:42] payment from one side to the other so we
[35:44] put own liquidity on our note to then
[35:47] obviously be able to have that service
[35:49] working so the customer sends this
[35:51] payment in and we root it directly to
[35:53] the merchants lightning wallet and take
[35:55] care of all the transaction uh
[35:57] transaction reports in CSV PDF coin
[35:59] tracking as soon as we will have a DAT D
[36:03] have as well and um also take care about
[36:06] the inbound liquidity obviously spoken
[36:09] to the regulator or are in the
[36:10] regulation process to to or in the
[36:13] process to to to get the um crypto asset
[36:16] service provider license and that's all
[36:18] um part of that you know obviously
[36:19] regulation isn't about lightning but
[36:21] it's just about running that that that
[36:23] that these channels um right and
[36:26] obviously receiving your payment and
[36:27] that's um with lightning what we take
[36:30] care of obviously do you think it's it's
[36:32] like Bitcoin has the massive Network
[36:35] effect this massic uh all those things
[36:38] going like first move Advantage Network
[36:40] effect all those things going for them I
[36:42] don't think we will ever get rid of
[36:44] Bitcoin anymore um maybe at like
[36:47] hundreds of thousands of years in the
[36:49] future there might be something coming
[36:51] new coming up I don't think so because
[36:53] Bitcoin is uh programmable so you can
[36:55] actually change it if there's some new
[36:58] challenged it um so it could actually be
[37:01] the end all be all money um but it's a
[37:04] hard thing to say like for a thousand of
[37:06] years because you have no clue what's
[37:07] coming maybe they're like aliens coming
[37:09] and they have Superior technology and
[37:11] Superior money and then we have to adapt
[37:13] their money stuff like that but uh
[37:16] Bitcoin is for like the next I guess 100
[37:18] years like the money that that um will
[37:21] most likely be the number one and will
[37:24] most likely be the one that everyone
[37:26] wants to have with the lightning network
[37:28] uh it's still a little bit in the
[37:30] earlier days do you think it's possible
[37:32] still to have other second layer
[37:35] solution like lightning uh the that the
[37:37] network effects and all the things that
[37:39] are already going for lightning um is
[37:42] still able to break or will lightning be
[37:45] the main catalyst to to scale Bitcoin
[37:49] well that's something obviously I cannot
[37:51] answer again very very good but I
[37:53] believe you know it's the same with
[37:54] Bitcoin and Alco altcoins if you look
[37:56] back you know we had Bitcoin as the
[37:57] first really cryptocurrency and it's
[38:00] still the biggest cryptocurrency and
[38:02] lightning obviously if you look at the
[38:04] charts from a transaction point of VI I
[38:05] think River done a very nice analytics
[38:07] on that um that you can really see since
[38:10] lightning is STS we've got that massive
[38:13] growth of transactions as well not just
[38:16] on the main chain but if you look
[38:18] overall on that Bitcoin transaction
[38:19] thing including lightning and it's
[38:22] obviously I think it's four years old
[38:24] now or five years already and um there
[38:27] has to be something new obviously and it
[38:29] needs time to develop again so I believe
[38:32] if I look back you know Bitcoin was
[38:34] there first it's still there lightning
[38:36] now was there first a layer two um um
[38:39] solution it's getting worked on
[38:42] so possibly there will be other Layer
[38:44] Two Solutions but I think lightning will
[38:46] be the the dominant one yeah yeah I
[38:50] always see like when I had already a lot
[38:52] of people that are way smarter than me
[38:54] when it comes to uh scaling on and the
[38:57] kind the thing that I see coming just
[39:00] because I talk with them and and get
[39:02] their information not because I actually
[39:04] do the research myself so I have to do
[39:07] that still in a in a deeper way but the
[39:10] thing that I heard and I think even Jeff
[39:12] poof said that that he imagines the
[39:15] scaling of Bitcoin like that he imagines
[39:17] lightning being the the main thing above
[39:20] Bitcoin and then uh for the last mile
[39:24] there could be at some point limitations
[39:26] that we run into lightning and then do
[39:28] some federations with like fedt or ecash
[39:31] or other things like that so but I think
[39:34] I think we're at a point where we kind
[39:35] of agree on like oh we need lightning
[39:37] yes uh and you can already see it like
[39:40] when you go to bitcoin conferences when
[39:41] you go somewhere uh where they accept
[39:43] Bitcoin like lightning is the is the
[39:45] thing it's not something else so uh I
[39:48] think lightning probably is the answer
[39:51] to scaling Bitcoin I don't know if
[39:54] that's why I ask like it's it's so
[39:56] interesting to think of like that early
[39:58] Network effects it's like asking in in
[40:00] 2012 if Bitcoin could be replaced like
[40:02] 2012 it's it's a way more interesting
[40:05] question now it's like ah no nobody can
[40:07] replace Bitcoin like that's you cannot
[40:09] get another Bitcoin well you know from a
[40:11] payment perspective you know seven
[40:13] transactions per second is not scaling
[40:15] you know there you know it can't be
[40:16] possible if you're at the point of sale
[40:18] let's say in a supermarket and there's
[40:19] someone spending their Bitcoin in Brazil
[40:20] at the same time that you have to wait
[40:22] and the cashier cannot do their business
[40:24] so that was that digital gold thing all
[40:26] the time and I believe you know it was
[40:29] made as a peer-to-peer Cash System not
[40:31] as a digital gold Reserve obviously it's
[40:33] a nice thing to it as well to have like
[40:35] this permanent storage of value as well
[40:37] but I believe Bitcoin needs to be spend
[40:41] as well that we get that adop adoption
[40:43] point you know as I said the the example
[40:44] of water before and um also you you
[40:47] spend it you will always sometimes spend
[40:49] it to someone who have who doesn't have
[40:51] Bitcoin right now so you directly orange
[40:54] pill him as well you know there's so
[40:56] good so much good things about spending
[40:57] a couple of ss from time to to time
[41:00] there's nothing really bad to say
[41:01] against it just maybe there's some
[41:02] people who say oh remember back if you
[41:04] you spend five years ago you spent x
[41:06] amount for one pizza but you know
[41:09] without this this Pizza Story there
[41:11] wouldn't be like so much things about
[41:13] spending Bitcoin at all so that guy did
[41:15] a great job I believe you obviously that
[41:17] could be millions billions now worth of
[41:20] bitcoin but you know maybe Bitcoin
[41:22] wouldn't be here now if people like him
[41:24] wouldn't have done that in the past you
[41:25] know showing that Bitcoin is not just
[41:27] some digital gold it's also possible to
[41:29] spend to get something for it and that
[41:31] was the first thing was a pizza and now
[41:33] you know I can go for example I can go
[41:34] to my newspaper shop I can get every
[41:36] newspack I can get get a even get a beer
[41:38] there I can go one one one um village
[41:41] over there I can get burgers there I can
[41:44] go to to Munich to the city can have
[41:46] drinks there with my mates in the
[41:47] evening I can even get um like um repair
[41:51] and works done in the Olympic Olympic
[41:53] Village um at a facility manager in
[41:56] Bitcoin so there's loads of places to
[41:57] spend Bitcoin already and it's growing
[41:59] you know I've also seen I think on coin
[42:01] Telegraph I've seen in 23 there was
[42:04] almost I think 173 I'm not sure wouldn't
[42:07] wouldn't wouldn't say I can't remember
[42:10] the the right number but there was an
[42:11] extreme Merchant adoption last last in
[42:14] the last year and I think that's a very
[42:16] good thing for Bitcoin because as I said
[42:17] before when people get confronted with
[42:20] that topic on a daily basis and everyone
[42:21] needs to buy food needs to see the
[42:23] barber has to rent a car whatever and
[42:26] they always see the bit accepted
[42:28] accepted sticker or like the merchant
[42:30] ask would you like to spend in Bitcoin
[42:32] as well then there's a there's more
[42:35] adverti good advertising for Bitcoin you
[42:37] know and for example I've got that one
[42:39] newspaper shop just around me and I'm
[42:42] I'm kind of friends with this Merchant
[42:43] now already and generally I would get a
[42:45] beer if I go there for free but now
[42:47] because I'm spending my Bitcoin there
[42:48] he's always so happy that I visit him
[42:50] because he's actually getting Bitcoin
[42:52] for his for the stuff is is is is is um
[42:55] selling and he's always so happy when
[42:57] someone goes into to spend Bitcoin um
[42:59] because he keeps it really he really
[43:00] keeps it he's not off ramping it to Euro
[43:02] and he really keeps it in the business
[43:04] um because obviously for him it was also
[43:06] it in beginning it wasn't easy to
[43:08] purchase Bitcoin at all so I really
[43:10] showed him how to purchase Bitcoin and
[43:12] now he's a bit lazy instead of
[43:13] purchasing it he's just accepting
[43:14] Bitcoin you know so that's I think it's
[43:17] a good thing and he's always happy to
[43:18] receive Bitcoin and and happy happy
[43:20] Merchant happy happy happy life you know
[43:22] that's that's that's all at the end of
[43:25] the day for us and I mean think that's
[43:27] that's the ultimate stacking goal that
[43:29] you don't have to buy Bitcoin that you
[43:31] can just earn Bitcoin that that that's
[43:33] amazing 100% 100% yeah I love it a lot
[43:37] and even like if you are now on like 30%
[43:40] Bitcoin and 70% Fe or the other stocks
[43:44] or whatever even if you then buy Bitcoin
[43:47] it's not like oh you spend it and then
[43:49] oh then you look back in like 30 years
[43:52] over what could have that been because
[43:54] you can also just buy more bitco buy
[43:58] more Bitcoin with the Fiat like for me
[44:00] as example with the pizza uh it doesn't
[44:03] really make sense for me because he like
[44:07] when when we go back and see this this
[44:09] guy and he spent like 10,000 Bitcoin on
[44:12] a pizza how many Bitcoin does he still
[44:15] have like he obviously understood
[44:16] Bitcoin it was interesting like maybe he
[44:18] had like 100,000 Bitcoin in his wallet
[44:20] and he spent 10,000 um he could also
[44:22] just like bought more maybe he saw then
[44:25] because of that transaction
[44:27] uh oh Bitcoin is actually working and
[44:30] this really nice I can work for maybe
[44:32] that's why that's the thing that he
[44:34] needed to prove for himself and that's
[44:37] why he does not have like 10,000 Bitcoin
[44:39] maybe that's why he has now 200,000
[44:41] Bitcoin who knows like like I think it's
[44:44] not known how many Bitcoin he has now
[44:47] probably not known because it would be
[44:48] stupid for him to to
[44:50] say yeah but the people just see what he
[44:53] lost with that transaction but they
[44:56] don't see what he probably gain from
[44:58] that transaction individually exactly so
[45:00] obviously no one would spend their whole
[45:02] Bitcoins on one item you know as I said
[45:04] before you know there might be some
[45:05] people who hling or believe Bitcoin is
[45:08] some kind of that diversity portfolio
[45:10] whatever you know but everyone can use
[45:12] Bitcoin as they desire you know I think
[45:14] that's one good thing about Bitcoin I
[45:15] would not tell everyone what to do with
[45:18] your Bitcoin but what I would really
[45:20] like to see from everyone is you know
[45:22] lightning wallet non-custodial or
[45:24] custodial choice of the Bitcoin and the
[45:26] end of today using it just to have a
[45:28] couple of Euros or dollars in Bitcoin
[45:30] lightning on there and really try to
[45:33] spend it you know it's just a couple of
[45:34] couple of Euros you anyway spend you
[45:36] know it's for beer for for for some food
[45:39] or whatever or for present and it just
[45:41] really helps it really helps the Bitcoin
[45:43] ecosystem amazing um before we come
[45:46] closer to the end routine um a couple
[45:49] questions why you so motivated to work
[45:53] full-time in Bitcoin what what drives
[45:55] you well to be honest in the beginning
[45:57] it was um I really wanted to get out of
[45:59] the fat job I was employed for the last
[46:02] I think yeah since I've started working
[46:04] you know I've started of apprenticeship
[46:05] and it system sales I've moved to the UK
[46:08] worked there for American Express then I
[46:10] came back was working in software again
[46:12] and it was all good you know you can
[46:13] obviously earn money with fear there's
[46:15] always money to be made but it's not
[46:17] like you don't get that that that
[46:18] feeling in the end of the day that
[46:19] you've done something right you know I
[46:21] really I was a bit sick of my fear joke
[46:23] to be honest was always the same you
[46:24] know you could sell you sell but the end
[46:27] of the day you just get money out of it
[46:28] there's no nothing else and with Bitcoin
[46:30] for example when I now reference another
[46:34] merch or we make another post there so
[46:35] much Bitcoin is saying well good job
[46:37] thank you very much you're helping the
[46:39] ecosystem we're getting we're really
[46:40] getting it back you know it's not just
[46:41] about the merchants but it's about the
[46:43] bitcoiners who really see that we're
[46:45] getting up early really to orange pill
[46:47] Merchants to send the message that it's
[46:49] important that there's Merchant adoption
[46:51] and we get much back you know there's
[46:52] also for example different online online
[46:55] people I've met through through that
[46:57] topic who really gave me loads of
[46:59] knowledge as well to bit to bitcoin
[47:02] about Bitcoin which I didn't even know
[47:03] before and I hadn't have any negative
[47:07] experience out of it so far to be honest
[47:09] it was for me very good a very good time
[47:11] so far and I would really like to
[47:13] continue doing what I'm doing because I
[47:14] really feel good in the evening when I
[47:16] sit down after exhausting day I think
[47:19] I've done something right what is for
[47:20] you the most important aspect uh of of
[47:23] Bitcoin the most important aspect of
[47:25] Bitcoin I believe is that your Your Own
[47:27] Boss when it comes to your money or You
[47:30] Can Be Your Own Boss when it comes to
[47:31] your money obviously you can decide how
[47:34] much service or how much non-custodial
[47:36] or custodial stuff you would like to use
[47:38] but the end of day you can decide
[47:39] there's not not there's no no must or
[47:42] have to you know you can run a note you
[47:44] don't have to you can have a hardware
[47:45] wallet you don't have to you can leave
[47:47] them on Exchange you don't have to
[47:49] obviously there's the a good way Tak an
[47:51] off the exchange put it in your Hardware
[47:53] wallet but there's maybe for example
[47:55] older people who don't trust lost in a
[47:57] hardware wallet you know because they
[47:59] just cannot realize what it what it
[48:00] means what it is when it's lost they
[48:02] don't realize you need separate Keys you
[48:05] so that's that's one thing that I
[48:08] believe it's so
[48:10] multi-usable and there will be more
[48:12] solutions in the future to have even
[48:14] more people on boarded who are not sure
[48:15] about Bitcoin yet and I believe in the
[48:17] long way there will be possibilities for
[48:19] everyone to get the best out of
[48:21] Bitcoin Ah that's that's very true and
[48:24] very beautiful honestly uh that view um
[48:28] one question that I always ask that is
[48:30] outside of Bitcoin uh in the end of the
[48:32] podcast is like what can we learn from
[48:35] you personally uh besides Bitcoin
[48:38] H well let me may maybe put it a little
[48:42] bit still together with Bitcoin I
[48:43] believe engagement is very important
[48:45] staying on it you know even if you get
[48:47] maybe like if you maybe fall down and
[48:49] maybe something happens or you get you
[48:51] get U negative feedback but always
[48:53] believe in your vision and always just
[48:55] be engaged on the ball you know just
[48:58] just smash it a lot perfect then let's
[49:01] come to the end routine where the
[49:02] previous guest is asking a question for
[49:04] the next guest without knowing who the
[49:05] next guest actually is uh and your
[49:08] question is an interesting one I would
[49:10] have several answers for that what is
[49:13] the most annoying aspect of the Bitcoin
[49:16] community so and I think the most
[49:18] annoying um thing about Bitcoin is that
[49:21] some of the bitcoiners are really like
[49:22] just to be offline so they're not really
[49:25] up for meeting at Bitcoin meet ups so
[49:27] you might just meet them you never meet
[49:29] them in the future that's a bit I think
[49:30] a bit sad about it you know but
[49:32] everyone's got their privacy and their
[49:33] views on but still nice to meet these
[49:35] people and but that's a little bit
[49:37] annoying from my perspective because I
[49:39] like really to know who I'm talking to
[49:41] and yeah amazing perfect then uh before
[49:44] I let you go where can people find you
[49:47] ask your questions where can people
