[00:00] it is absolutely disgusting what they do
[00:02] and I think that it's only going to get
[00:03] worse because Bitcoin is a threat to
[00:06] them most of what we see that gets
[00:08] labeled as quote unquote capitalism is
[00:10] really corporatism and is just as evil
[00:12] as Socialism or anything else the
[00:14] solution is sound money it doesn't
[00:16] matter if that's Bitcoin or not the fact
[00:18] that Congress passed a bill that would
[00:20] effectively ban the use of a website is
[00:23] incredibly
[00:25] authoritarian uh you wrote a book uh the
[00:29] Liberty solution
[00:30] first of all like let's get a little bit
[00:32] into your book what's what's the core
[00:34] message of the book like what's the the
[00:36] core principles that you can uh give us
[00:39] from from the the book what inspired you
[00:41] to write it and then like uh when we get
[00:44] into this then we later can get a little
[00:46] bit also in Bitcoin yeah so um at its
[00:50] core the the book is mainly a
[00:53] philosophical tretis on Liberty and
[00:56] natural law um you know we
[01:00] we as a as a as a people um particularly
[01:05] in the US we have this uh misguided
[01:09] understanding of what Liberty actually
[01:11] is um you know we seem to misunder
[01:16] understand that
[01:18] uh Liberty means that people will act in
[01:21] a way that you don't like as long as
[01:23] they're not hurting anybody um there is
[01:27] you know they have the right to do those
[01:29] sorts of things in modern political
[01:31] American
[01:32] discourse um and I'm sure it's it's like
[01:35] this all across the globe uh to to what
[01:39] rather large degree but um we seem to
[01:42] think that Liberty means that which I
[01:44] like and agree with and that's not the
[01:47] case um you know you'll get your typical
[01:49] conservatives talking about um you know
[01:53] let's let's ban uh burning the American
[01:56] flag or let's ban this or ban that and
[01:59] then you got people on the left the the
[02:00] lefties that are all uh yeah let's ban
[02:03] guns let's um you know let's make sure
[02:07] that we use the state to uphold this
[02:10] doctrine that we agree with that's not
[02:13] what Liberty is Liberty
[02:15] is uh taking Soul dominion over your own
[02:18] life and not infringing upon those on
[02:22] the right of another person to do the
[02:24] same so just because somebody is acting
[02:27] in a way that you find morally
[02:29] reprehensible
[02:30] um outright you know
[02:34] deplorable uh as long as they're not
[02:37] bringing harm to another person direct
[02:40] harm then they have the right to do that
[02:43] so you know if somebody wants to uh a
[02:46] simple exp uh simple example that I give
[02:49] is if somebody wants to you know drink
[02:51] to excess on a very daily basis and just
[02:54] get sloppy drunk um that's their right
[02:57] to do it and some people might argue
[02:59] well well he's harming himself well he
[03:01] owns himself and he has the right to
[03:05] engage in those harmful behaviors uh you
[03:07] could extend this a step further to
[03:09] things like drug prohibition or drug you
[03:11] know substance control and scheduling by
[03:14] the state it all is the exactly the same
[03:17] thing fundamentally so just because
[03:19] somebody is in using a substance that
[03:22] you don't like they have the right to do
[03:24] that because of the fact that they own
[03:26] themselves and I expand upon on this uh
[03:31] in part one of the book highlighting
[03:32] different areas in which the US
[03:34] government infringes upon the rights of
[03:37] individuals um whether that be TSA
[03:40] screenings uh gun background checks uh
[03:44] taxation uh you name it and then in part
[03:48] two I apply those principles into what I
[03:51] consider real world application so uh
[03:54] what would it look like if we took
[03:56] Liberty to its its logical
[04:00] conclusions and I argue that that would
[04:03] be reminiscent of what is called anarcho
[04:06] capitalism and for those who
[04:08] aren't uh you know privy on the
[04:10] philosophy basically it means no
[04:13] government exists no centralized
[04:15] Authority no Monopoly on violence to
[04:17] coer people
[04:19] into uh into
[04:22] compliance but it also means self-
[04:24] ownership it means taking responsibility
[04:26] for yourself and for for your for your
[04:29] loved ones and I also make it very clear
[04:32] as to what capitalism is because there's
[04:34] a lot of misunderstandings there's a lot
[04:37] of um there's a lot of stigma around
[04:40] what capitalism is and most of what we
[04:43] see uh that gets labeled as quote
[04:46] unquote capitalism is really corporatism
[04:48] and uh is just as evil as you know
[04:52] Socialism or anything else uh so
[04:55] capitalism is nothing more than the free
[04:56] and voluntary exchange of private
[04:58] property within a free market and
[05:02] anything that's beyond that scope
[05:03] doesn't fit the criteria so what anarcho
[05:07] capitalism really means is you know you
[05:10] taking Soul dominion over your life
[05:13] you're responsible for your life and and
[05:15] everything about your life and you have
[05:17] the freedom to exchange your property
[05:19] that's all that it means and I also dig
[05:22] a little bit deeper as to what Anarchy
[05:24] means and how it is also stigmatized and
[05:27] misrepresented as being some s sort of
[05:29] Mad Max style you know
[05:32] apocalyptic world where uh you know
[05:36] warmongers have taken over uh and how
[05:40] there's you know slavery everywhere and
[05:42] my my thought on that is that that is
[05:45] actually what we have right now with
[05:48] statism and any sort of centralized
[05:51] government so that's kind of ultimately
[05:54] what the book is about and I think that
[05:56] in particular what um you you know what
[06:00] what your listeners might be interested
[06:02] in is how money changes without a
[06:06] centralized Monopoly on violence like
[06:08] the government uh how do we engage in
[06:12] that sort of transaction if we don't
[06:14] have the US Federal Reserve and the US
[06:18] Treasury you know printing these
[06:20] wonderful Federal Reserve notes that we
[06:22] have and you know you know the or the
[06:24] euro in in in Europe uh how do we
[06:28] negotiate that Medium
[06:30] of exchange and it's it is um it is
[06:32] something that I explore a bit uh and
[06:35] honestly it would ultimately yield a a
[06:39] much more
[06:40] satisfactory quality of life for
[06:43] everybody 100% agre them with with with
[06:46] that and um I I often talk about Bitcoin
[06:49] in the podcast I mean almost every
[06:51] podcast episode is is almost primarily
[06:54] about Bitcoin there are a few exceptions
[06:56] to that uh and I had a few podcasts
[06:59] episodes back the discussing about what
[07:01] is freedom actually like what does it
[07:04] mean what does freedom mean and for me
[07:07] and you touched on it uh I mean
[07:10] conceptionally for me is freedom uh uh
[07:14] goes as far as the freedom from someone
[07:16] else's started so as a small example for
[07:19] that if I don't use my seat Bel in my
[07:21] car it's totally up to me like nobody no
[07:24] third party should be able to tell me uh
[07:27] to click my uh seat belt because it's my
[07:30] body I can do whatever I want to to do
[07:32] with it and I if I choose to do the seat
[07:34] Bel I choose to do it if I not then I
[07:36] don't but I cannot drive with 200
[07:40] kilometers per hours through a street
[07:42] where there are kids playing or
[07:44] something like that this this would be
[07:46] uh something irresponsible because I
[07:49] could damage someone else's life uh and
[07:52] there where it makes might make sense to
[07:54] have like guidance uh or or at least
[07:58] like signs that like okay dve years
[07:59] lower because your freedom expands over
[08:03] to someone's else's freedoms is that
[08:05] what you described like uh Freedom goes
[08:07] as far as someone else's Freedom starts
[08:10] or is that something different no I I
[08:13] would I would Echo most of what you said
[08:17] where I would disagree is that while it
[08:20] is certainly a bad idea to drive 200 km
[08:24] per hour past a a neighborhood park
[08:26] where children are playing as long as no
[08:29] nobody gets injured as a result of that
[08:31] you do technically have the right to do
[08:33] that now we could get into the nuances
[08:36] of uh you know who owns the street that
[08:38] you're driving on because at the end of
[08:40] the day there is you know in my ideal
[08:42] world there's no such thing as quote
[08:44] unquote public property there's either
[08:47] uh Nature's property which hasn't been
[08:49] claimed which has you know is just as
[08:52] virgin as the day that the Earth was
[08:54] born uh and then there is private
[08:57] property so private property is any
[08:59] anything that has had labor introduced
[09:01] to it to transform it from the way that
[09:03] nature left it to us so in my ideal
[09:07] World somebody would own those streets
[09:10] and they would have the right to dictate
[09:12] you know your speed limits as terms of
[09:14] use which you would voluntarily agree to
[09:18] as a condition for utilizing that road
[09:21] um but ultimately uh as long as nobody
[09:26] is
[09:27] injured uh then you do have the right to
[09:30] do it is it dangerous yes should it be
[09:31] frowned upon absolutely should it be
[09:33] ostracized even uh yeah probably um but
[09:39] as long as nobody is harmed you do have
[09:41] the right to do that and going back to
[09:43] the private owner and operator of that
[09:45] street uh by violating their terms of
[09:48] use you are in effect uh trespassing so
[09:52] you would be there is an argument to be
[09:54] made that if anybody is harmed in this
[09:56] scenario it's the owner of the street
[09:58] and not the the children that are
[10:00] playing because they actually didn't
[10:02] have any direct harm now if you hit one
[10:04] of those children that's a completely
[10:05] different story does that make
[10:07] sense yeah definitely I mean uh when
[10:11] everybody respects the private property
[10:14] and everybody is like okay this is a
[10:16] street where I only can drive this limit
[10:19] it's owned by this individual and he
[10:22] says okay this is an area where kid
[10:25] should play and I should not drive as
[10:27] fast uh but what if there is like in
[10:31] that world is there any centralized
[10:33] aoria on on on um uh a monopoly on uh
[10:39] violence as you said uh is is there
[10:42] anything stuff like that because when
[10:45] there's a conflict coming up how do we
[10:47] manage that like how how do we come up
[10:50] with solutions for conflicts in if
[10:52] they're like okay but maybe this like I
[10:56] I hear so many times of like
[10:57] neighborhoods like the the one neighbor
[10:59] like no that that's my side or this like
[11:01] there are so many weird reasons to go to
[11:03] court um is there in such a Solutions
[11:07] are the private courts is there like the
[11:09] private institutional courts how is this
[11:11] how is this side of the story working
[11:14] yeah so you're you hit it right on and
[11:16] and this doesn't again this is all
[11:18] theoretical um and so any solution that
[11:21] I present either here or in my book is
[11:23] just an idea there actually infinite
[11:26] number of of ideas that we could come up
[11:28] with that um could serve as a as a
[11:32] potential solution to all this what I
[11:35] have kind of La laid out a little bit in
[11:37] the book is is private arbitration uh
[11:39] private courts and and we even have this
[11:41] to a degree um with alternative dispute
[11:46] um resolution so instead of bogging
[11:48] something down in a torque Court um you
[11:51] know people get together with a third
[11:53] party mediator or even an arbitrator uh
[11:56] to look over everything and come to
[11:58] either a compromise or in the case of
[12:00] arbitration actually make a ruling even
[12:02] though it's not a a government judge
[12:05] making that ruling um the parties agreed
[12:08] to go to arbitration and uh agreed to
[12:12] whatever the outcome was it's a
[12:14] voluntary agreement and we could expand
[12:17] that to essentially be the entire court
[12:19] system where if somebody has uh a
[12:23] grievance against somebody else they
[12:24] could petition that Court um all the
[12:27] fees would have to be covered uh by uh
[12:30] you know the parties involved in some
[12:32] way or another by by
[12:34] agreement um and uh you know they would
[12:39] rule agree to to follow the ruling one
[12:43] way or the other before it happens um
[12:45] you know in the cases of like this it
[12:48] would be pretty straightforward and
[12:49] simple okay uh he set this limit you
[12:53] exceeded that limit willingly and and at
[12:56] a you know double triple whatever the
[12:58] the speed limit was um you know this is
[13:01] pretty objective here you violated his
[13:02] terms of service and therefore we're
[13:04] going to enforce what penalties he lays
[13:06] out for violating those terms of service
[13:08] now there is no Monopoly on violence to
[13:11] make sure that this happens and so let's
[13:14] say I took you to court for speeding on
[13:17] my
[13:18] streets I wouldn't have
[13:21] like cops come to your house and invoke
[13:24] violence on you if you didn't pay me
[13:26] what was deemed to be paid from that
[13:29] Court ruling but what I could do is I
[13:33] could publicly ostracize you and say hey
[13:35] look this person went to court with me
[13:38] uh it was ruled in my favor and he owes
[13:41] me this amount of money uh per that
[13:44] ruling and he has not paid me now your
[13:47] reputation in this world has actual
[13:50] value and what I'm doing is I am
[13:52] publicly depreciating your reputation as
[13:56] somebody who can't be trusted which
[13:57] means that all the other relationships
[14:00] that you would voluntarily have are now
[14:02] kind of questioning what type of person
[14:04] that you are uh and so some of them
[14:06] might want to end your their
[14:09] relationship with you or at least keep
[14:11] you at a different distance so this
[14:13] could impact your B future business
[14:14] dealings this could impact any future
[14:17] relationships that you have public uh or
[14:19] um professional personal whatever um you
[14:23] know if it's bad enough like in the
[14:24] cases of of murder rape like legitimate
[14:28] evil acts being committed not just a oh
[14:30] I disagree uh but legitimate evil acts
[14:34] your landlord could kick you out of the
[14:35] out of your house uh your bank could
[14:38] close all your accounts and just send
[14:39] you all your money and say I'm not going
[14:40] to deal with you anymore your employer
[14:42] could instantly terminate you your life
[14:44] would be
[14:46] destroyed without having this
[14:48] centralized Monopoly on violence because
[14:50] of public ostracism based off of what
[14:54] you actually
[14:55] did I love that idea I mean uh I always
[15:00] argue for more freedom I I'm always uh
[15:03] whenever I'm in a group of people I'm
[15:04] always the one arguing for more freedom
[15:06] and and less State
[15:08] interference uh a lot of the arguments
[15:11] that I he against it is like how do we
[15:14] protect uh the ones that are coming I
[15:16] mean this is a minority we have to
[15:18] always capture like we should not make
[15:20] rules for uh uh like not get in a
[15:24] Direction Where We only make rules for
[15:26] minority and put it on whole a whole a
[15:29] whole pack uh if if you know what I mean
[15:32] um but what if like in that kind of a
[15:35] world uh for people that come with
[15:38] disabilities on the world where they
[15:39] just cannot um have so much value for
[15:43] society as somebody somebody else and
[15:45] this is like as I said small amount of
[15:48] people the most most are just lazy as as
[15:52] I see it and they should be more
[15:54] incentivized by a more incentivizing
[15:56] system but what do we do with with those
[15:58] kind of people is is there like just
[16:00] private institutions that would
[16:02] naturally care for them because they are
[16:04] good human
[16:06] beings yeah and I would also argue that
[16:09] human beings are naturally like a
[16:12] bit on the uh altruist side we do care
[16:17] for our fellow human um what has kind of
[16:21] desensitized that has been the
[16:23] government's involvement uh with
[16:26] literally everything where oh don't
[16:28] worry about the government will take
[16:29] care of it if there was no government to
[16:32] take care of it then I firmly believe
[16:35] that we as humans would identify people
[16:38] who are going through very hard times
[16:41] either by or through no fault of their
[16:44] own uh or maybe they made bad decisions
[16:47] and they're trying to learn from them
[16:49] people genuinely are very charitable for
[16:53] the most part uh even despite the fact
[16:57] that uh the government has stolen more
[17:00] and more of our property you know as the
[17:03] years have gone on uh I forget the
[17:06] actual numbers but I broke it down in a
[17:08] later chapter in my book uh despite the
[17:11] fact that tax revenues quote unquote or
[17:13] theft has gone up significantly even
[17:16] adjusted for the devaluation of the
[17:17] dollar charitable donations have also
[17:20] skyrocketed and if we stopped the theft
[17:24] from the government to begin with then I
[17:27] think that people would be even more
[17:29] charitable than they already are and
[17:31] already have proven themselves to be and
[17:34] uh unlike um you know the the government
[17:38] controlled Charities you know you have
[17:41] to do these sorts of things to maintain
[17:42] your nonprofit status and blah blah blah
[17:45] uh those regulations wouldn't exist and
[17:47] so they would actually have the ability
[17:49] to focus on uh really helping other
[17:53] people and they'd have a fiduciary duty
[17:55] to helping those people uh and then once
[17:58] they are back on their feet um you know
[18:01] they're better off for it instead of you
[18:03] know getting some government handout
[18:05] which essentially perpetuates the issue
[18:08] um and uh you know doesn't actually
[18:10] resolve anything I I think that private
[18:13] Charities would be a a great mechanism
[18:17] especially in an anarchist type world
[18:20] without government control and
[18:21] regulation to make sure that they're
[18:23] hitting these these these these and this
[18:25] you know uh regulatory burdens just to
[18:28] be a charitable
[18:31] organization I always argue that Bitcoin
[18:33] is nonpolitical
[18:35] um even though I see a lot of arguments
[18:38] against that actually uh because Bitcoin
[18:41] incentivizes some behaviors for example
[18:44] Bitcoin incentivises low time preference
[18:46] against High Time preference uh bit
[18:48] incentiv is like to keep your money and
[18:50] not spend it on dumb [ __ ] you don't need
[18:53] uh biton also incentivizes as I think
[18:57] freedom to a certain extents because
[18:58] it's for me and I want to get into it if
[19:01] you see it the the same way for me it's
[19:03] the only real property we can actually
[19:05] hold because it's the only property even
[19:07] if someone is putting a gum to your head
[19:10] you can still choose to keep it and with
[19:13] a house someone can shoot you and then
[19:15] can just take the house like because
[19:16] it's physical uh Bitcoin you can keep in
[19:19] your head and they can shoot you but
[19:21] maybe they they shoot away your Bitcoin
[19:23] also um what I want to go with like is
[19:26] is that kind of a um idea what you
[19:30] describe in the book and what you we
[19:31] describ now in the first 20 minutes of
[19:33] the podcast is bitcoiners is Bitcoin
[19:36] bringing us a little bit closer to that
[19:39] future absolutely um you know Bitcoin
[19:43] will always be the the OG of cryptos
[19:47] right I mean it was the first one um you
[19:50] know it revolutionized what money
[19:53] potential could be and I think you know
[19:57] you've seen since the Inception of
[20:00] Bitcoin all of these other cryptos come
[20:03] out uh some having real utility others
[20:07] not so much like Dogecoin you know it's
[20:10] just based off of hype okay but most
[20:13] people don't realize that a lot of the
[20:14] crypto projects that we see the altcoin
[20:16] projects are actually based off of you
[20:18] know rather real utility um and much
[20:22] like investing in a company's stock um
[20:26] you know there is some inherent
[20:29] value uh tied to that crypto asset um
[20:34] that that can help revolutionize the the
[20:37] crypto industry even more and ultimately
[20:41] what cryptocurrency is is it is com
[20:45] competition in uh being born into the
[20:49] medium of Exchange Market which
[20:52] governments have always had a monopoly
[20:54] on and that's what makes it so
[20:56] revolutionary is that before four
[20:59] governments controlled what money was
[21:01] they defined what money was whether that
[21:04] was the Roman Empire um you know taking
[21:08] what the what their Roman coins were uh
[21:11] the purity of them as far as you know
[21:13] silver and gold content would be and
[21:15] then saying oh yeah we're going to
[21:17] decree that we're going to clip this a
[21:18] little bit uh for you know for
[21:21] justifiable reasons I assure you uh And
[21:24] So It ultimately they ended up clipping
[21:26] out all of the all of the actual in
[21:28] value of it and making it nothing more
[21:30] than a a 10 coin that doesn't have any
[21:34] value whatsoever which is what
[21:35] ultimately caused the Roman Empire to
[21:38] fall and we see that we saw that in in
[21:41] ancient Rome we see that now with you
[21:44] know the Federal Reserve the World Bank
[21:47] uh all of these centralized Banks uh
[21:52] essentially having a complete fiat
[21:56] currency uh you know
[21:59] what's even kind of crazier is these
[22:01] modern monetary theorists coming out
[22:03] like this is what the future of money is
[22:06] no this is not what the future of money
[22:08] is this is this is
[22:11] legitimately the track record of Fiat
[22:13] money has been and it's been abysmal but
[22:16] because cryptocurrency has been able to
[22:18] become an actual competitor into an
[22:22] otherwise monopolistic
[22:24] environment that means that people start
[22:27] looking at their government
[22:30] currency with a little bit less Sparkle
[22:32] in their eyes and I think that as time
[22:37] goes on and you've already seen it from
[22:39] 2009 to now in
[22:41] 2024 people have started to understand
[22:44] the value that Bitcoin has and the value
[22:48] that that other cryptocurrencies have I
[22:50] mean uh C uh Bitcoin is uh is back over
[22:54] 60,000 right now and yet we still
[22:57] celebrate Bitcoin Pizza day where
[23:00] somebody spent 10,000 Bitcoin on two
[23:03] pizzas 10,000
[23:05] Bitcoin you know you you take all of
[23:07] this and you you give it to the average
[23:09] person and say this is what real money
[23:11] can
[23:12] do then they start to wonder about those
[23:15] little Federal Reserve notes in their
[23:17] wallet and the the the balance that
[23:19] shows on their bank account and that's
[23:22] the beauty of capitalism generally but I
[23:25] think that it's really indicative of how
[23:29] powerful an entity is that has control
[23:32] over the
[23:33] money yeah I totally agree with that
[23:36] like I mean the only part that uh like I
[23:39] I don't see a lot of value in the alcoy
[23:41] market right now uh I mean I could be
[23:43] wrong and I like I like as I came into
[23:46] the crypto market like four or five
[23:48] years ago uh then I was like Bitcoin had
[23:51] a lot of other altcoins in my portfolio
[23:54] then I went Bitcoin only then I went
[23:55] really toxic against all the altcoins uh
[23:59] now I'm more like a free market
[24:01] proponent where I'm like okay I have
[24:02] only Bitcoin uh but everything else like
[24:05] is also fair game uh if if they will
[24:08] have long-term real utility and value in
[24:11] the market they will sustain uh let's
[24:13] see where it goes if if they don't they
[24:16] don't uh it's like the the free market I
[24:19] I also don't get why an art like mon Le
[24:22] or something like that uh which has
[24:24] obviously a lot of value for for people
[24:27] I would never pay anything thing for for
[24:29] that uh pending because it has no value
[24:31] for me but that's where the free market
[24:33] comes in right you have some people uh
[24:36] like only this some people only like
[24:38] this H let's see what the what the
[24:40] future holds up uh but I don't see the
[24:43] the I don't see the proof from
[24:45] decentralization on a lot of the other
[24:47] um uh cryptos and that's why I'm like
[24:50] scared away of them because I see a lot
[24:52] of things for example the second was
[24:55] decentralized as as I see it or the the
[24:57] most powerful from the altcoins is
[24:59] ethereum uh and then I'm like okay they
[25:01] switch completely their the proof of
[25:04] work to proof of stake model they
[25:06] already uh moved back um a transaction
[25:10] and I'm like okay maybe maybe I'm
[25:13] switching the the central bank for like
[25:15] a private one that's maybe even worse I
[25:18] don't know uh but I I I like Bitcoin
[25:21] where like there's nobody manipulating
[25:24] it and Bitcoin has kind of proven that
[25:26] it's actually centralized espe
[25:28] especially if the block size Wars this
[25:30] was a big one for me like without the
[25:32] block size Wars I think the pro
[25:34] provability of Bitcoin that it so the
[25:36] centralized would be different uh but as
[25:39] we come back to free market like Bitcoin
[25:41] can also fail and that's what I'm trying
[25:44] to uh get across my my my podcasts more
[25:48] and more where I'm like okay yes I'm all
[25:50] about Bitcoin I love Bitcoin I would uh
[25:52] always support Bitcoin uh but I could
[25:55] also be wrong but what I'm not wrong is
[25:57] about my value my my uh thinking of the
[26:01] free market and that we need sound money
[26:03] and the evolution of sound money and
[26:04] that's why I like the Bitcoin standard
[26:06] the book from cine so much because it
[26:07] talks about like the the history of
[26:10] sound money and how how we have like
[26:13] drifted off a little bit with the the
[26:15] the fat notes uh and how bad it is and
[26:19] even if Bitcoin Fades tomorrow I will
[26:21] still have the podcast and still will
[26:23] educate for some money we probably need
[26:26] a better solution then uh but it would
[26:28] be really hard would be a devastating
[26:30] day but I would not stop the advocate
[26:33] for some money then we just need another
[26:35] form of that uh even though I definitely
[26:38] don't believe that Bitcoin will go away
[26:40] anytime soon yeah yeah yeah I I I
[26:43] completely agree and the thing is like
[26:45] you said it the solution is sound money
[26:48] it doesn't matter if that's Bitcoin or
[26:50] not anything that
[26:52] sound for a monetary medium of exchange
[26:56] will work as long as there's no Monopoly
[27:00] over it that competition is really what
[27:04] um will help ensure that we don't get
[27:08] into like what we saw with the Roman
[27:10] Empire with cutting of coins uh and you
[27:13] know ultimately ending up on a purely
[27:16] Fiat
[27:17] standard yeah yeah what did actually
[27:20] initially like did you have always F
[27:22] like that or is was some event in your
[27:25] life where like was driving more wordss
[27:27] to the the freedom side of things is
[27:29] there something like that formed your
[27:32] your brain in into this
[27:34] direction that is a simple question with
[27:36] a with a bit of a long-winded answer so
[27:39] I'll try and keep it a little short but
[27:41] um you know I grew up in a typical
[27:45] conservative household you know American
[27:47] conservative household red white and
[27:49] blue you know uh love the 4th of July
[27:53] you know that that type of uh that type
[27:55] of family uh we always vote a republican
[28:00] because Freedom yay um and I remember
[28:06] you know when I was in high school I I
[28:09] really idolized the
[28:12] um the nuances of you know at least what
[28:15] history was being told to me about
[28:17] America's founding and championing of of
[28:20] individual liberty and this that and the
[28:22] other so it was always kind of something
[28:23] that resonated with me then I joined the
[28:26] military right after
[28:28] high school and um that was the first
[28:31] time I started really questioning some
[28:33] things um but I was still very much a
[28:38] republican um you know very much a
[28:40] somebody who loved and supported the
[28:43] Constitution of the United States of
[28:45] America and uh thought that I was
[28:47] serving my country but I would see a
[28:50] couple things and it just trigger
[28:52] something in my brain like this doesn't
[28:55] seem right and and
[28:59] um I got out of the military uh and then
[29:04] I I kept watching what current events
[29:08] were were leading to and uh it kind of
[29:12] just evolved from there I became a bit
[29:14] more libertarian as time went on um and
[29:19] uh I decided to officially stop calling
[29:22] myself a republican in 2016 when um when
[29:27] Donald Trump won the the nomination I
[29:29] was just like this is this is this is
[29:31] reality TV there's nothing real here um
[29:35] and 2016 was the first time I voted
[29:37] libertarian um and I kept I kept that
[29:42] ideal uh and I became a gun rights
[29:45] Advocate um I had a podcast for Lone
[29:48] Star gun rights uh which is a Grassroots
[29:51] gun rights organization in the state of
[29:53] Texas our main goal at that time was to
[29:56] get permitless carry p where you could
[29:58] carry a gun on your person without
[30:00] having to beg the state for permission
[30:01] to do so
[30:03] first and um I uh I I remember in I
[30:09] think it was 2017
[30:11] is um there was a there was a tragedy in
[30:15] at a high school in Santa Fe Texas where
[30:17] somebody had um you know killed a bunch
[30:20] of students and it was really tragic um
[30:24] following that uh there was a gun rights
[30:27] rally
[30:28] uh that we organized called carry for
[30:31] our kids um and I was a speaker at that
[30:35] event and I gave my speech on Liberty
[30:38] and you know rights and all that and
[30:42] somebody in the audience uh afterwards
[30:45] came to me and said hey I think you
[30:46] should write a book on on this because
[30:48] what you said was really profound and um
[30:51] you know it just made a whole lot of
[30:53] sense and I'd like you know to if you
[30:55] could like put this in book form and
[30:57] just expand on it to every direction
[31:00] that you can I think that would be
[31:02] really awesome and so the next day I
[31:04] started writing my book which ultimately
[31:06] became the Liberty solution and as I'm
[31:09] writing it I think when I first started
[31:12] writing it I called myself um more of a
[31:15] men archist I would I I would I would
[31:17] often say I'm three degrees separated
[31:19] from a from an
[31:21] anarchist and uh as I did all the
[31:24] research for my book uh I st stumbled
[31:28] upon a writer by the name of Murray and
[31:31] rothbard and that changed my life
[31:34] because Murray rothbard articulated
[31:37] things
[31:38] that he articulated solutions to the
[31:42] very few things that I could
[31:45] not come up with reasons that the
[31:48] government shouldn't exist in those
[31:49] areas like like we talked about courts
[31:51] or police and things like that uh those
[31:53] were the few areas where I was like I
[31:55] don't see anything other than the
[31:56] government being able to control these
[31:58] things you know fairly quote unquote uh
[32:01] and then I read Murray rothbard's for a
[32:03] new Liberty and he laid it all out for
[32:06] me and I was like well that's it I'm an
[32:08] anarchist now there's there's no more
[32:10] excuses um you know I have the solutions
[32:14] you know at least ideas for those
[32:16] Solutions and how they could work uh and
[32:20] that's kind of my philosophical
[32:22] Evolution you know from you know my high
[32:25] school days till now if you're listening
[32:27] to this podcast you might be wondering
[32:29] what is actually the setup look like of
[32:31] Robin or how can I improve my Bitcoin
[32:34] setup and there's two things you have to
[32:36] buy Bitcoin from the right source and
[32:38] you have to store Bitcoin the right way
[32:40] let's focus on the first thing how to
[32:42] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[32:45] only exchange don't deal with the
[32:47] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[32:49] exchange that has an own token or
[32:51] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[32:53] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[32:56] for me the best partner for that and now
[33:00] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[33:01] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[33:04] a self custody solution where you
[33:07] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[33:10] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[33:13] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[33:16] your Bitcoin on there back up your seed
[33:18] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[33:22] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[33:24] ,000 in Bitcoin it's a absolutely m must
[33:28] have one last thing before we get back
[33:29] to the video I'm really passionate about
[33:32] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[33:34] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[33:37] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[33:40] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[33:43] conference in whole of Europe for all
[33:45] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[33:48] this place in June for all europees it's
[33:50] a must go anyways you are so close to
[33:53] the Bitcoin Pride conference you
[33:54] basically have to come I will do
[33:56] interviews there and I would love to
[33:59] meet you all there use code Robin for
[34:02] all my sponsors to get discounts and use
[34:05] the links down in the description I love
[34:07] it so much uh I mean we like there
[34:11] there's always like this this points in
[34:13] the life where like the the life is kind
[34:15] of formed and I love also that you wrote
[34:17] a book uh a really selfish question now
[34:21] because I'm also in the um process of
[34:24] thinking of all the things I've learned
[34:26] in the last like 26 years where I'm on
[34:29] on on this planet uh and thinking of
[34:32] like B going I have a I have like four
[34:34] directions where I want to go with that
[34:36] book um what tips do you have for
[34:40] someone that wants to write his first
[34:42] book uh and has no clue about writing a
[34:46] book or publishing a book uh do you have
[34:48] any like tips or like anything that you
[34:51] will like or I wish I've known that
[34:53] before uh anything like that how much
[34:57] time do you have
[34:57] [Laughter]
[35:00] I will I will tell you this uh probably
[35:03] one of the best things that you can do
[35:05] is create a solid outline before you
[35:08] ever put pen to
[35:10] paper
[35:12] um always remember that you are always
[35:15] your worst critic so after you're done
[35:18] writing something and you go back and
[35:20] read it remember that you're going to be
[35:23] critiquing yourself more than anybody
[35:25] else on the planet will be and and so
[35:29] because of that I would always find
[35:31] somebody that you trust to kind of read
[35:34] things but make sure that they
[35:36] understand that you're looking for
[35:38] criticism you know you're looking for
[35:40] ways to improve it don't just tell me
[35:42] it's good because you're my friend or
[35:44] whatever um somebody that will be honest
[35:47] with you uh whether that's you know the
[35:50] nuances of a Sate structure or whether
[35:53] the whole idea just seems bogus that's
[35:55] fine you can take that feedback and even
[35:57] if you disagree agree with the feedback
[35:59] it might give you even something that
[36:00] you can address in a in a subsequent set
[36:03] of paragraphs like some might argue this
[36:05] this and this and to that I would say
[36:07] you know something like that um and then
[36:12] I would say be
[36:14] patient
[36:15] because I like I'm working on my second
[36:18] book now and
[36:21] um I have hit the worst writers block I
[36:25] have ever had I have not written a word
[36:27] in about 3 months now it happens be
[36:31] patient with it let it come do not force
[36:34] it because that's just that's just going
[36:38] to it's going to take away from your
[36:40] overall message uh I know that there are
[36:43] some things that are a bit time
[36:45] sensitive especially if you're writing
[36:47] non-fiction um you know because
[36:50] something could change in the crypto
[36:52] industry um as you're writing that
[36:54] changes a Nuance of a direct that you
[36:57] were going
[36:59] so be patient with it if you need to if
[37:02] you need to make those changes make
[37:04] those changes uh but don't feel like oh
[37:07] I have to get this done immediately
[37:09] because uh you know if I don't then
[37:11] things could change and then what am I
[37:13] going to do well everything's going to
[37:15] change at some point so take your time
[37:19] with it step by step make sure you have
[37:21] a good outline don't be afraid to edit
[37:23] your outline either as you're going um
[37:26] but just something to help keep your
[37:28] your your focus and and make sure that
[37:30] it's a I I'll tell you whenever you're
[37:32] writing things are going to start
[37:33] jumbling up in your head like crazy
[37:36] you're going to be in the middle of a
[37:37] paragraph and like oh crap where do I
[37:38] want to go with this and that's kind of
[37:40] where your outline will help because
[37:42] then you can instead of writing it on
[37:44] your your actual draft you can kind of
[37:47] type out a couple of bullet points and
[37:48] be like okay how do I want to go about
[37:50] this so that's the advice that I would
[37:52] give
[37:53] you it's amazing I I've I've actually uh
[37:56] started uh just writing chapters and I
[38:00] think I have now like 30 or something
[38:02] like like I not writing chapters just
[38:04] like the headlines of it uh and the
[38:07] short like five sentence thing where I'm
[38:09] like okay I could write this and I'm
[38:11] like now just in the process of finding
[38:14] ideas and and finding directions I can
[38:16] go with I did not read any like did not
[38:18] write anything down and the amazing
[38:20] thing is also like just the process of
[38:22] starting okay I want to write a book
[38:25] started something amazing whenever I
[38:26] have a
[38:28] I'm like oh [ __ ] this is something
[38:30] really nice I'm just writing down in
[38:32] this note and this like it started with
[38:33] like a half a page now it's like all
[38:36] already 10 pages long this thing uh and
[38:40] it will be I think it will be more
[38:41] complicated to have like a focus book
[38:44] then like I will I think I will not
[38:46] struggle with finding content more like
[38:48] with with making good content and and
[38:51] making what I also really like is that
[38:53] you said like timely content because I
[38:56] always try also with the podcast I try
[38:59] to not um put anything in there that is
[39:02] like current like I will I will never
[39:04] talk with with guests about like oh this
[39:07] just happened in Bitcoin let's talk
[39:09] about it because uh I want this every
[39:12] podcast episode to be um digestible also
[39:15] in there like a year or two years
[39:18] obviously some things will change as the
[39:21] Bitcoin price when we talk about bitcoin
[39:22] price we mentioned the Bitcoin price now
[39:24] I feel like in four years when someone
[39:26] watches this will be like a choke to him
[39:28] that the Bitcoin price was at 60,000 uh
[39:31] but yeah like I try always do everything
[39:35] I do to be uh Timeless to be Evergreen
[39:39] uh because this is uh how I just fun
[39:42] function except of my Twitter page but
[39:44] this this is something different I think
[39:46] a tweet canot live long anyways um but
[39:50] yeah um in in the sense of social media
[39:53] and content which is also really
[39:55] interesting for for freedom because it's
[39:57] kind of in this digital Revolution that
[40:00] I think brings more freedom to our world
[40:02] because when we look back we only had
[40:04] this like media companies and only this
[40:09] uh like scripted things and now we have
[40:11] individual creers and a
[40:14] decentralized way of getting information
[40:17] more decentralized they are still living
[40:19] on centralized platforms but at least
[40:22] there's uh a person that I can directly
[40:25] follow um do you do also see this like
[40:28] do you see like a decentralization of
[40:30] content creators a decentralization of
[40:32] individual reporters and not like one
[40:36] big media house that has like a head on
[40:39] top of it that controls what's in the
[40:41] newspaper what's not and more like okay
[40:44] I can follow him I can follow Derek on
[40:46] on Twitter I can follow Robert on
[40:49] YouTube like is this like also like a
[40:51] kind of a
[40:52] decentralization uh of of our world and
[40:55] brings more freedom
[40:57] I I can see it in it in its infancy uh I
[41:01] I say that with a little bit of
[41:03] caution um you know like YouTube is a
[41:06] Google company very much in bed with the
[41:09] with governments across the world uh
[41:13] especially
[41:15] for combating what they call
[41:17] misinformation which is anything that
[41:19] goes against the propagandized
[41:21] narrative
[41:23] um would you think of something like
[41:26] Twitter um uh
[41:28] where the the the owner has said that
[41:31] this is a fle free speech platform it is
[41:34] better it is a better option than say
[41:37] YouTube is um and of course this is you
[41:42] know the content format notwithstanding
[41:44] just trying to get your message out
[41:46] there it's better to an extent but at
[41:48] the same time I would not say that
[41:50] Twitter is a free speech platform uh
[41:53] there are still people getting banned
[41:55] for saying things that aren't really
[41:58] that terrible um it's still better for
[42:04] people who are more liberty-minded
[42:06] to a to to a very large
[42:09] degree um but I think that it still has
[42:13] a long way to go because you know
[42:14] freedom of speech really means freedom
[42:18] of speech saying whatever you feel like
[42:22] saying um and I get the whole uh freedom
[42:26] of speech not freedom of reach thing and
[42:28] yeah absolutely as a as a capitalist
[42:30] myself I understand that Elon has the
[42:34] authority to dictate what is allowed and
[42:37] isn't allowed on his website I'm not
[42:39] saying that he
[42:40] doesn't but I will say that saying that
[42:42] it's a free speech Haven is a bit of a
[42:45] misnomer um there are people that I've
[42:48] seen get banned for ultimately rather
[42:50] super Superfluous things um it's getting
[42:54] better there it has been a very long
[42:57] process and I have seen some improvement
[42:59] along those lines uh I still think that
[43:03] it has a long way to go but with that I
[43:05] will say that as far as social media
[43:07] generally is concerned Twitter does have
[43:11] the
[43:12] most freedom for the content
[43:15] creator uh among the
[43:19] mainstream social media
[43:22] platforms um so I use Twitter very
[43:25] heavily um I know that there are uh some
[43:29] more decentralized and even like fully
[43:31] open- Source social medias like uh I
[43:34] think mastadons one I I don't know
[43:37] there's there's a couple that are just
[43:38] kind of out there but the thing is they
[43:40] don't have a lot of users so it's as a
[43:44] content creator you can't really rely on
[43:46] those even though they may be
[43:47] objectively better for um you know
[43:50] freedom of speech and saying what you
[43:52] want uh it whenever you go to a place
[43:56] like that you're not going to get you
[43:58] know the engagement that you're
[44:00] otherwise wanting and needing as a
[44:02] content creator especially if you're if
[44:04] you're trying to make a career out of
[44:05] content creation which I by no means am
[44:08] but um you know with content creation
[44:11] you need engagement with engagement you
[44:13] need people and with you know that means
[44:15] that you're going to have to be on
[44:17] something that has the people so um
[44:21] Twitter is the best option from all of
[44:24] the social media mainstream social media
[44:26] networks but
[44:27] uh I still think that it has a ways to
[44:29] go uh it has a long way to go and I full
[44:32] heartedly agree with that uh and it's
[44:36] it's for me fascinating I feel like I I
[44:39] am on uh Instagram YouTube on Twitter
[44:43] and I think Instagram is the worst place
[44:45] I get really really
[44:48] fast something taken off I feel like
[44:52] even though my reach is not as as big on
[44:54] the as on the other platforms which is
[44:56] also like feel like when the reach is
[44:57] higher you should get B ban faster
[45:00] because people recognize it but yeah
[45:02] it's it's all of the not so uh YouTube
[45:05] are more careful especially with the
[45:07] shorts that I put out uh I notice when
[45:10] there's some word in there that they
[45:12] don't like like [ __ ] uh they will
[45:15] demonetize that shorts uh which I really
[45:18] don't care for because shorts are like
[45:20] they don't get any money anyways I mean
[45:22] some money I think the the most the the
[45:26] the the most successful shorts brought
[45:28] me 5 or something like that so it's uh
[45:31] not really money da was like 50 cents or
[45:33] like something like that so it's not
[45:35] really a monetary game it's more like a
[45:38] a reach game um but Twitter is kind of
[45:43] like I was I was never concerned like
[45:45] it's also like a mental thing like when
[45:47] you when I'm going on YouTube I'm trying
[45:49] to like uh put something in a frame
[45:52] which does not
[45:53] offend YouTube Just when I put like the
[45:56] thumbnail the titles the descriptions
[45:58] inact because I I will not cut anything
[46:00] out what the guest said uh but when I
[46:03] think about everything that I can
[46:05] outside of that I try to do a good job
[46:08] that the video gets as far as it can go
[46:11] on the YouTube platform uh but on
[46:15] Twitter like I just put out stuff like
[46:18] uh this is like my my mindset is just
[46:21] way more free on Twitter uh which I did
[46:24] not like I had I had no reason to do
[46:27] that because I was never anything like
[46:29] any bad on on YouTube I had never a bad
[46:32] experience on YouTube and I had never a
[46:35] bad experience on Twitter so like this
[46:37] mental thing is maybe just like a ghost
[46:40] in my head uh but also experience from
[46:42] other people uh and then we have other
[46:45] platforms like madone as you said and
[46:47] Nostra is a big one which you can also
[46:50] directly send Bitcoin and stuff like
[46:52] that it works uh but as you said it's
[46:55] not a mass thing
[46:57] not a lot of people use it uh and yes
[47:01] the few really big guys there actually
[47:04] could make a living out of it but they
[47:06] also have like a really big following
[47:08] somewhere else uh and they need Mass
[47:12] adoption in order to be really compet
[47:15] competitive to Twitter but what I think
[47:18] and I hope maybe I'm just like a really
[47:20] hopeful person and a really uh positive
[47:22] thinking person I hope that those kind
[47:25] of Innovations and also
[47:27] going in a more freedom direction that
[47:30] this just triggers that if you're not a
[47:33] freedom loving platform in the future
[47:37] that people will go away from them that
[47:40] like the the freedom platforms are those
[47:42] those where the people are more and more
[47:45] I feel like Twitter got a lot of reach
[47:47] in the last one year uh because people
[47:51] came back and it got way more um yeah I
[47:55] feel like the the conversations are more
[47:57] happening now on Twitter than before the
[48:00] the platform got more live into it uh
[48:03] but it's it's it's funny how it goes and
[48:05] I feel like just as a con grader I will
[48:08] do my best job possible to just like put
[48:11] the freedom word and the Bitcoin word
[48:13] out there and if I get banned I get
[48:15] panned I have to live with that yeah no
[48:18] I I I agree I think that um you know
[48:22] honestly one thing that the folks at
[48:25] Twitter could do to really increase
[48:28] their support is fully open source their
[48:31] front end and back end uh for the entire
[48:34] site so people can audit it you know in
[48:37] the in the open source community and say
[48:39] oh yeah this is what the algorithms are
[48:41] and oh this is what leads to you getting
[48:43] Shadow Bann and things like
[48:45] that I mean they they started doing that
[48:48] but not completely right they they have
[48:50] some type of algorithms is is open
[48:52] source but not everything we just step I
[48:55] feel like also like I this a speculation
[48:58] on my side but I feel like IL musk is
[49:01] trying to get in this direction uh but
[49:03] he does not want to get too fast there
[49:07] like he's is slowly slowly getting
[49:09] getting there and you can see the the
[49:11] steps he's implementing because he's
[49:13] also seeing a platform that working and
[49:16] he does not want to break it too fast so
[49:19] it's it's it's still working uh because
[49:22] they also are depending on advertisement
[49:24] money and stuff like that uh so it it's
[49:27] it's it's it's funny how how it goes
[49:29] with I love the scene where he said like
[49:32] [ __ ] you to the greatest I nor to the
[49:35] greatest to the the advertisers disne
[49:37] Disney
[49:38] [Laughter]
[49:41] also yeah um but on on that note do you
[49:44] see or do do you witness a war uh on
[49:47] privacy especially like on privacy on
[49:50] freedom uh right now like do you see
[49:53] like the the people
[49:55] like absolutely abolutely uh Congress
[49:58] just you know the US Congress just
[50:00] passed it as effectively a Tik Tock ban
[50:04] now I don't use Tik Tok um but the fact
[50:08] that Congress uh passed a bill that
[50:11] would effectively ban the use of
[50:14] um a website is incredibly
[50:18] authoritarian uh and you know the NSA
[50:21] has always been had
[50:24] their their you know their their focus
[50:27] on abolishing people's privacy uh
[50:31] especially in this digital day and age
[50:33] that we live in um you know and I don't
[50:37] think anything has gotten better on that
[50:39] on that front in the you know now 11
[50:41] years since uh Ed Snowden you know
[50:43] revealed what they were doing I think if
[50:46] anything has gotten worse um I you know
[50:49] especially with the implementation of AI
[50:51] I can only imagine what the NSA is using
[50:53] AI for um H you know because that just
[50:57] makes that just streams line streamlines
[50:59] their you know information
[51:02] gathering um it's it's evil it it really
[51:06] is especially because um they're they're
[51:11] using private
[51:13] companies uh as as their essentially
[51:16] their scapegoats right you know they
[51:18] they're effectively
[51:20] requiring companies to have these terms
[51:23] of use to where they're collecting data
[51:25] for the purpose of giving to the
[51:27] government because the government is
[51:30] essentially holding them hostage and you
[51:32] know making them by tax and stives or or
[51:35] whatever you know something that nobody
[51:37] in their right mind was G is going to
[51:39] turn down if it is voluntary and I'm not
[51:41] even so sure that it is um but you know
[51:45] I I I've seen articles come out like
[51:47] opinion pieces saying that oh yeah you
[51:51] don't need to use vpns
[51:53] anymore uh which kind of tells me that
[51:55] they're wanting to Target V vpns uh
[51:58] which is very very
[52:00] concerning uh I could see them launching
[52:03] a an attack on tour for those who don't
[52:06] know what tour is it's the dark web um
[52:10] launching attacks on tour uh launching
[52:13] attacks on even open- Source Community
[52:16] items uh I could see them spinning that
[52:18] as some crazy you know as some crazy
[52:20] propagandized way to where oh yeah open
[52:23] source is evil for one reason or another
[52:25] and and they'll spend it in a way where
[52:26] the masses will will ultimately believe
[52:29] it um and so that'll get rid of you know
[52:33] your aftermarket operating systems for
[52:35] your phone or'll get rid of using Linux
[52:38] uh you know for the most part uh I could
[52:41] I could see them going
[52:44] after well anything that's not based in
[52:47] the United States and essentially
[52:48] turning the United States internet into
[52:51] what the Chinese and North Koreans get
[52:55] which is nothing
[52:56] um and especially if they close all
[52:58] those bridges um you know they're
[53:01] they're they're pushing hard on kyc for
[53:04] digital assets uh you know they just um
[53:08] well I know you don't like you know
[53:10] keeping things you know with current
[53:12] events but they just arrested uh Roger
[53:14] ver uh on tax evasion even though he's
[53:17] no longer a US citizen um it's it
[53:22] is absolutely disgusting what they do
[53:25] and I think that it's only going to get
[53:26] worse
[53:27] because uh honestly because Bitcoin and
[53:31] cryptocurrency is a threat to them
[53:34] because people are waking up a little
[53:35] bit and so they're going to use it to um
[53:40] they're going to use it as as a weapon
[53:42] you know to to make sure that people get
[53:45] into compliance um and I just see that I
[53:48] just see a lot of bad things happening I
[53:51] really
[53:51] do yeah it's a massive threat to them I
[53:54] mean I just see like even in Austrian in
[53:56] Germany uh I just recently talked with
[53:59] like yesterday talked with someone uh
[54:02] who has in a small town in uh in in his
[54:05] his town where he's living in fbook uh
[54:08] he's just going around and trying to
[54:11] motivate every restaurant every shop to
[54:15] accept Bitcoin uh just to like have
[54:18] those options and they're really like
[54:19] passionate about it and they're like
[54:21] this is there there this option uh and
[54:25] as I'm like I only hold Bitcoin like I
[54:27] don't hold any fear currencies I just
[54:30] use it as a medium of exchange at this
[54:32] point because I'm forced to do it but if
[54:34] we are like fighting more and more for
[54:36] for Bitcoin and uh more and more
[54:38] Merchants just accept Bitcoin because
[54:41] they can uh then like if if I could live
[54:45] like if if there would not be tax
[54:47] implications on bitcoin and I could
[54:49] actually spend it directly I would not
[54:52] use fat this is like I'm only using fat
[54:54] because I'm actually forced to do it uh
[54:57] and uh we see in countries where you're
[55:00] not forced to use it as like as Salvador
[55:04] uh and there are even like in the Swiss
[55:07] there Lugano where you can uh pay your
[55:09] taxes or at least some taxes in uh in in
[55:13] in Bitcoin where you can pay most of the
[55:16] shops with Bitcoin and stuff like that
[55:18] uh I recently interviewed a company uh
[55:21] which completely operates without a bank
[55:23] account in Swiss which is amazing to me
[55:27] uh so it's definitely a frat to it like
[55:29] it's it's it's fascinating to see yeah
[55:32] uh I would I would also be curious as to
[55:34] see how some of these countries expand
[55:36] their uh legal tender laws uh because
[55:39] right now they you know legal tender
[55:41] laws for the most part are saying you
[55:43] must accept you know Federal Reserve
[55:45] notes or Euros in exchange for your
[55:48] debts I could see them expanding that to
[55:50] say you can only accept Federal Reserve
[55:54] notes or Euros for exchange of of goods
[55:57] and and as payment of Le for legal
[56:00] tender uh I could see that and that
[56:02] would absolutely be devastating if they
[56:04] did that um I I don't know what the
[56:07] reaction would be hopefully it would be
[56:09] one where they would be forced to undo
[56:12] something like that but uh yeah I I
[56:15] could see the state doing that for
[56:17] sure absolutely and I feel like the the
[56:21] the states are getting more and more
[56:23] fartin how do you keep like different
[56:26] maybe a weird question for you but how
[56:28] do you keep like your optimism up like
[56:30] how do you see like is is is Bitcoin uh
[56:33] one of the things where like okay it's
[56:35] like a little bit of Hope for for the
[56:36] future is like how do you maintain your
[56:39] hopefulness and optimism for the future
[56:42] it is very hard um anybody I think I
[56:46] think anybody listening will understand
[56:48] it it is very hard um the world is not
[56:52] sunshines and rainbows it it is very
[56:55] very even
[56:57] very um very tyrannical very oppressive
[57:02] and the scary part is is that your
[57:05] average person probably doesn't
[57:07] understand the extent to which if they
[57:09] even understand that it is at all um
[57:13] because essentially the world has
[57:15] transformed uh from Nobles and peasants
[57:18] to Elites and free range peasants who
[57:21] don't know that they are free range
[57:23] peasants um you know you you you'll see
[57:26] with Americans all the time talking
[57:27] about how this is the land of the free
[57:28] and it's like no no it's not uh and then
[57:33] they'll say something stupid like well
[57:35] go Mo move to Somalia or something it's
[57:38] like okay you you don't you don't
[57:41] understand what tyranny is clearly
[57:42] because of the fact that um you know
[57:47] there is no better there is no good
[57:49] place on the planet to live it's all
[57:52] awful um and that's that's the world as
[57:55] it is
[57:57] um one thing I do is I I I do see I I
[58:03] try to help spread the message of
[58:05] Liberty a lot you know like I've done
[58:06] with my book and you know I post essays
[58:08] on
[58:09] Twitter um to try and help get you know
[58:13] wake people up and so there's some
[58:15] optimism there I'm Not Alone In My Views
[58:19] clearly I mean you're you're along the
[58:21] lines too um and there are people waking
[58:24] up and you know with more and more
[58:26] people getting into crypto I think that
[58:28] that is um something that is positive as
[58:31] well there are a few nuggets of optimism
[58:34] that can be viewed uh and so I try and
[58:38] focus on those as much as I can but I
[58:41] still know that the world is a [ __ ]
[58:43] place um any place that the state exists
[58:46] is going to be a a tyrannical [ __ ] hole
[58:51] um but you know I'm looking to uh I need
[58:55] to take care of me and my own so that's
[58:57] where my focus is I would love to change
[59:00] the world and maybe one day one of my
[59:02] books or articles will uh or at least
[59:05] have a hand in that I I don't have any
[59:09] delusions of grandeur that that will
[59:11] ever happen but um you know if I can if
[59:15] I can help change a few people in the
[59:16] world uh you know that's that's a few
[59:19] more than we had and um you know I it's
[59:24] it's it's easy to be pessimistic
[59:27] and so I am I mainly focus on how I can
[59:32] improve the life you know my life and my
[59:35] family's life um and how we can
[59:39] essentially live out our
[59:41] days in relative peace so that's where
[59:44] my focus
[59:46] is do you see El Salvador as as one of
[59:49] the places because bitco not like to
[59:51] talk about Sal but yeah they also have
[59:54] their their the big FL L but do do you
[59:57] even observe El Salvador right now with
[60:00] Bitcoin and stuff like that yeah um I
[60:02] remember when El Salvador added Bitcoin
[60:05] to their legal tender laws um and I
[60:09] thought that was amazing of course time
[60:12] will tell you know what the political
[60:15] climate in El Salvador turns into be um
[60:19] you know uh Argentina is another one
[60:21] that I kind of have an eye on but there
[60:24] are some things that Malay has doing
[60:26] that I'm not excited about uh but you
[60:31] know and then you know the it might just
[60:35] be as simple as building a cabin in the
[60:37] woods and you know uh being as far away
[60:41] as I can be from the state but um you
[60:43] know I'm I'm open to anything anywhere I
[60:46] would love to retire and uh in a place
[60:49] where I don't have
[60:51] to uh where I can just be happy and my
[60:55] my family is happy and healthy and then
[60:57] ultimately that's all that matters so um
[61:00] you know I'm look I'm always looking at
[61:01] other countries uh if if possible if as
[61:05] a potential solution um but I'm not at
[61:09] retirement yet so all of that could
[61:10] change you know over the next 20 years
[61:14] so yeah definitely um and I feel like
[61:18] when was you said like uh I said it in
[61:20] the previous podcast um last year was at
[61:24] Bitcoin Prague and it's a kind of a
[61:25] different Bitcoin conference than the
[61:28] Bitcoin conference in America it's like
[61:30] really focused more on privacy and
[61:32] freedom uh I feel like from the from the
[61:35] crowd also uh um it's just a subjective
[61:38] feeling that I have there and it's uh I
[61:41] I compare it to more like a freedom uh
[61:43] conference and less than a Bitcoin
[61:45] conference we talk a lot about privacy a
[61:47] lot about freedom and and stuff like
[61:49] that I I feel like I'm I'm really
[61:51] looking forward to June uh to to this
[61:53] podcast to this conference again and
[61:55] because there will be a lot of uh
[61:58] like-minded people in real life not just
[62:01] in podcast form not just on Twitter I'm
[62:03] always looking forward to that kind of a
[62:06] uh conversations in real life um before
[62:09] we end the the podcast with our Andre te
[62:12] uh what are you currently extremely
[62:14] passionate about is there anything that
[62:16] we did not cover or about your passions
[62:19] that you learning a lot or you're
[62:21] covering a lot in your life that we did
[62:22] not cover on the podcast till
[62:24] now um
[62:26] I mean I I've just always been been
[62:29] passionate about Liberty generally uh
[62:31] which is kind of why I am the way that I
[62:35] am and why I advocate for what I
[62:37] advocate for um but there is uh one
[62:41] thing that I am pursuing uh or at least
[62:44] will be actively pursuing over the next
[62:47] year uh and that's to get my pilot's
[62:49] license because I think that that will
[62:51] help open up uh more opportunities to uh
[62:56] to explore places of potential
[63:00] retirement um you know I I have always
[63:03] had a a passion for flying even though
[63:05] I've never I mean
[63:08] I the the last time that I that I flew a
[63:11] plane was in 2009 it was also the first
[63:13] time I flew a plane uh but I'm um I've
[63:18] always wanted I've always been
[63:19] interested in aviation I've always
[63:20] wanted to get my pilot's license and I'm
[63:22] finally I'm finally going to start do it
[63:25] doing it and um I think that that could
[63:29] be a a really cool way to one help
[63:32] spread the message of Liberty but also
[63:34] to you know expand my horizons Beyond uh
[63:38] what you know where they currently are
[63:39] and have the freedom to travel without
[63:42] having the TSA molest
[63:45] me I love it I've I've flown uh twice as
[63:49] much as
[63:50] you I have a friend of mine who is a
[63:52] pilot and I flew with him two times uh
[63:55] and and I had the honor to land uh the
[63:58] two times and flow in the air a little
[64:00] bit even though I have no clue about
[64:02] flying but he explained a little bit to
[64:04] me so I'm not completely lost and he was
[64:07] always there but it's a really nice
[64:08] feeling I feel like I'm not in in the
[64:11] live phase right now where I will do it
[64:13] because I'm just rebuilding stuff uh but
[64:17] if I had like the time I would I would
[64:19] love to do it like I that's I I would
[64:22] love to do it um for the endro we have
[64:25] endro where the previous guest is asking
[64:26] a question for the next guest which is
[64:28] always a difficult part because I cannot
[64:31] I will not I I don't control that kind
[64:34] of a question and the previous guest
[64:36] does not know who the next guest is so
[64:38] it can be a question where like the next
[64:40] guest does not uh know much about it uh
[64:44] I will still ask it if if you have uh if
[64:46] you have an opinion on that or if you
[64:49] know about that um when will the Bitcoin
[64:53] meeme Pool A M Pool clear next if at
[65:00] all uh meme pull like Meo Meo it's it's
[65:05] not related to any meme oh it's not
[65:07] related to mem I don't know what a
[65:09] Bitcoin mle is uh so I'm gonna say
[65:12] tomorrow how about
[65:14] that tomorrow is that a good thing or a
[65:16] bad thing I uh I think the mble will not
[65:21] clear like it it's it's been what is a
[65:23] mble like the mble you can see all the
[65:26] transactions and every 10 minutes we
[65:28] have the blocks and when it clears
[65:30] there's no transaction the block like
[65:32] this is this kind of this feeling and I
[65:34] it was last time happening over a year
[65:37] now uh I think last April maybe it was
[65:41] like last year ago April uh so uh it
[65:45] could never happen again like uh I and I
[65:49] had last uh podcast guest vicet on and
[65:53] vicet is extremely deep in to uh like on
[65:57] a blockchain level of Bitcoin which I
[66:00] I'm not like I could not in deep explain
[66:03] to you what a mol actually is I'm trying
[66:06] to educate myself more and more also
[66:08] with inviting guests like that I took a
[66:11] lot of modes um but it just like it's
[66:15] interesting to see the the free market
[66:17] dynamics on the Bitcoin blockchain with
[66:19] transaction fees and stuff like that uh
[66:22] that's uh also from a free market uh
[66:24] dynamic points of view I think it's
[66:27] really interesting to see that uh the
[66:30] fee development of Bitcoin where we have
[66:33] some fees of like really high because
[66:35] you can set your own fee like you can
[66:37] you can pay $1 million to transact one
[66:42] Euro like you can do that if you want
[66:44] like nobody's nobody is is holding you
[66:48] back from that which is an interesting
[66:50] for
[66:51] experiment but yeah that's that's the
[66:54] question but yeah it's obviously uh not
[66:57] non good question but I I still wanted
[66:59] to give it to the next guest to keep the
[67:01] end routine
[67:02] going yeah uh well in that case I would
[67:05] say that if it is going to happen again
[67:07] I would say at the end of the bull
[67:09] market the current bull cycle I I I I'll
[67:13] go with that yeah it's actually also
[67:15] been the longest time uh that it's not
[67:19] has been cleared for so long like we in
[67:22] Uncharted Territory right now in the
[67:24] Bitcoin blockchain if you will
[67:26] interesting uh but yeah um before I let
[67:29] you go where can people like ask you
[67:31] questions about the book ask you
[67:33] philosophical question like where can
[67:35] people reach you in the best possible
[67:37] way so you can find me on Instagram at
[67:41] ancap there I am very inactive there I
[67:43] don't post a lot if anything I'm just
[67:46] kind of scrolling uh the main place you
[67:48] can find me is on Twitter or X whatever
[67:52] you want to call it ancap airca
[67:55] P air uh my DMs are open or you can at

[68:12] my sexy voice narrated for you so you
[68:14] know uh yeah I don't know if that does
[68:16] anything for you but uh but yeah it
[68:18] could be a selling point so why not um
[68:22] and uh yeah I'm I'm mostly on Twitter
[68:24] I'm working on my book now this one's
[68:26] going to be a novel so um um uh
[68:29] hopefully this writer block ends quickly
[68:32] because I really am excited about the
[68:34] direction of this book The where this
[68:35] book is going but I just need to figure
[68:38] out how to get there yeah it's
[68:40] definitely selling point like I'm an
[68:42] audible fan I I'm unable to read books
[68:46] for some reason uh but I consume books
[68:49] on Audible really good and I can also
[68:51] remember stuff more and when I read read
[68:54] books I like I don't know maybe I have
[68:56] some brain function but I I'm getting
[68:58] bored so much uh and and then I drift
[69:01] off uh and I'm a big audible fan and I
[69:03] always like when the offer is speaking
[69:07] himself especially when I know the offer
[69:10] when someone is listening to that and
[69:12] they're not curious about the book it's
[69:14] it's definitely a selling point I feel
[69:15] like that's that's a good thing to do
[69:17] and I would not do it differently with
[69:20] my book I will always like have the
[69:21] narrations even though it's could be a
[69:24] timec consuming but it's like a one-time
[69:26] thing you have to do like you invested
[69:28] time it's definitely good and good that
