[00:00] I kind of put myself on the Bitcoin
[00:02] standard anything I wasn't spending I
[00:05] saved directly into Bitcoin um and I did
[00:07] that for about two and a half years at
[00:09] that point it was like top peak of like
[00:10] the second cycle and I was doing really
[00:12] well so I traveled the world was taken
[00:15] care of myself kind of opening up my own
[00:17] business and then I moved to New York
[00:20] I've been in the Bitcoin industry since
[00:22] 2016 when I first joined Bitcoin more
[00:25] professionally at a startup that was
[00:26] doing payments for e-commerce websites
[00:29] pre- lightning living back then at the
[00:31] 17 marker versus now you know most
[00:33] people are like oh why would you do that
[00:35] like you were in a bare market right but
[00:38] the whole purpose of that stack is when
[00:40] it's there you can use it even if it's
[00:42] going to gain in value over the next
[00:44] year and a half to two years that stack
[00:46] continued to grow against Fiat so I
[00:48] spent less and less of it for what I
[00:50] actually needed which is the opposite of
[00:53] what you know traditional savings gives
[00:55] you
[01:00] who are you what are you doing in
[01:01] Bitcoin and and what are you most
[01:03] excited about in Bitcoin yeah for sure
[01:06] um so I'm aan uh Chan I've been in the B
[01:09] Bitcoin industry since
[01:11] 2016 um when I first joined Bitcoin um
[01:15] more professionally at a startup that
[01:16] was doing payments for e-commerce
[01:18] websites pre- lightning um I was very
[01:21] intrigued by it then kind of continued
[01:23] down that rabbit hole of learning about
[01:25] Bitcoin when there wasn't a lot of
[01:26] information out um getting into ethereum
[01:30] altcoins shitcoins whatever you'd like
[01:31] to call them um and then kind of finding
[01:34] my way back into Bitcoin custody through
[01:36] different startups and then after about
[01:39] four years ago after leaving Unchained I
[01:41] actually moved into um Bitcoin education
[01:43] and Consulting because I find a lot of
[01:45] people you know spend hours down that
[01:48] rabbit hole and I try to make that
[01:50] Journey for um as easy and painless as
[01:53] possible by providing you know through
[01:55] conversation helpful information and
[01:57] knowledge um as far as myself I'm a
[02:00] creative a techie someone who is very
[02:03] passionate and loves Bitcoin um I'm an
[02:05] entrepreneur and yeah I've just really
[02:07] like the industry and I like what people
[02:09] are doing and I like the way that
[02:10] Bitcoin can really help change people's
[02:12] lives and I want to continue to push my
[02:14] life work in that direction really cool
[02:17] so it's already your your third cycle in
[02:20] Bitcoin I I I heard that the last time
[02:23] uh that uh I think like two or three
[02:25] days ago that was also I published a
[02:27] podcast with someone that was already
[02:29] the third time third cycling Bitcoin and
[02:31] someone let left that comment and it it
[02:34] it made me think of like the the really
[02:37] high signal you usually get from people
[02:40] that are in Bitcoin longer than two
[02:43] cycles like more than uh eight years
[02:46] basically uh so like eight years plus is
[02:48] kind of an off thing like I
[02:50] unfortunately am only here for like four
[02:53] and a half soon five years I'm not done
[02:57] with my two my first two cycles but what
[02:59] uh what have you learned so far from
[03:01] from being so long in Bitcoin and being
[03:03] so long in the
[03:05] industry yeah my journey I feel like is
[03:07] different from a lot of people that I've
[03:09] come across in the industry um whether
[03:11] that's people that I'm working with who
[03:13] are working in Bitcoin or people who are
[03:15] just like you know bitcoiners I'm not
[03:17] going to say that they're like Maxis but
[03:19] they are you know very heavy into
[03:22] Bitcoin um sorry can you repeat that
[03:24] question oh the eight years yeah the
[03:27] eight years what do you have learned so
[03:29] so far from
[03:31] yeah um as far as like learning I
[03:33] actually really learned the value of
[03:35] Bitcoin right so when I first got into
[03:37] Bitcoin I was very interested behind the
[03:39] blockchain technology and you know the
[03:41] decentralization and it very different
[03:43] from the traditional financing like
[03:45] Finance systems but then over the like
[03:47] four or five years it took me a while to
[03:49] like truly understand that right having
[03:52] you know created so many multi-
[03:53] signature wallets and transactions
[03:55] testing multi-sig custody options
[03:57] teaching other people about that and
[03:59] then furthermore after that it's kind of
[04:01] just iterating to myself I'm going to
[04:03] continue down this path because I have
[04:05] been educated and I think a lot of
[04:07] people kind of fall off because you know
[04:09] some people get into it to make that
[04:11] money some people get into it to you
[04:13] know educate themselves but not it takes
[04:16] a few number of people to continue down
[04:18] that line after the seven eight years
[04:20] especially two cycles in because you
[04:22] know you get into Bitcoin then you want
[04:24] to learn about ethereum then you got
[04:26] altcoins right people want to go down
[04:28] that realm not every everyone sees
[04:30] Bitcoin for what Bitcoin is and I think
[04:32] that comes from understanding and kind
[04:35] of getting your hands dirty in um other
[04:37] areas of like the crypto space
[04:40] absolutely yeah by the way what what did
[04:42] you do at unchain did you help people uh
[04:44] get onboarded with with s custody or
[04:47] what was your older yeah so I joined
[04:49] nchain as one of like the first top uh
[04:51] first 10 people um my back uh my job
[04:55] experiences were actually Q heavy on QA
[04:57] engineering and Client Services
[05:00] as well as loan operations so I helped
[05:02] with um loans when we both had Bitcoin
[05:04] and ethereum multisig Loans um then when
[05:07] they released the Vault product for
[05:09] collaborative custody um Caravan for
[05:11] their open source um and then yeah then
[05:15] teaching those clients that knew nothing
[05:17] about like key management and wanting to
[05:19] learn about multi-sig how to manage
[05:22] their keys and then create BTS and then
[05:24] protect their keys
[05:26] afterwards interesting so they were not
[05:29] always Bitcoin only but not wait now
[05:31] they are Bitcoin only right yeah so I
[05:33] think about two years in um around the
[05:36] time that bols came out they stopped
[05:39] with their ethereum multi-sig loans
[05:42] interesting yeah I wasn't aware of that
[05:45] like there there are some companies that
[05:47] are now Bitcoin only that that I know
[05:49] that actually started with Bitcoin they
[05:52] in integrated uh altcoins and then they
[05:55] got back to bitcoin only signal uh which
[05:57] which is a fascinating thing because a
[05:59] lot of individuals also start like that
[06:01] I also started with Bitcoin got into
[06:03] ethereum got into other altcoins and
[06:05] then like went back to bit Bitcoin only
[06:08] it's interesting that companies also go
[06:10] through the same learning curve than
[06:11] individuals do absolutely I you know I
[06:15] was at that time I was very like altcoin
[06:17] heavy and I was working with a lot of
[06:19] people who are very Bitcoin heavy and so
[06:22] one thing that I had learned from them
[06:24] was the scarcity of Bitcoin right
[06:27] why why is Bitcoin um why Bitcoin over
[06:32] other coins and then ethereum had moved
[06:33] from proof of work to proof of stake um
[06:36] and then you know burning coins is
[06:39] another thing so the transition from
[06:42] crypto to bitcoin is primarily what kind
[06:45] of financial services you would like to
[06:46] offer and longterm and then what kind of
[06:49] Technology you're going to produce from
[06:51] that and then the upkeep from that right
[06:54] we even and chain even had a ethereum
[06:57] multisig open source um that they were
[07:00] working on and then when Caravan kind of
[07:03] got released and we they had stopped
[07:05] doing ethereum multisig loans alog
[07:08] together that open source kind of also
[07:10] dissipated it's still around it it's
[07:13] just not probably not something you
[07:14] would want to use because ethereum has
[07:16] also the technology has advanced as well
[07:18] interesting yeah that's super
[07:19] interesting um and you uh said in the in
[07:23] the thing that you that you sent me for
[07:25] the preparation that you lift off your
[07:28] stack for for for some some time is that
[07:31] basically retiring on on of of Bitcoin
[07:34] that you tried there sort of um so when
[07:37] I left on chained I had put my I had
[07:39] been in a pretty well-off financial
[07:41] situation you know so in 2018 I kind of
[07:45] started my
[07:47] full-time um job employment was working
[07:50] at various startups was living paycheck
[07:52] to paycheck I kind of put myself on the
[07:55] Bitcoin standard um unknowingly not
[07:58] knowing what the Bitcoin standard was so
[08:00] I anything I wasn't spending I saved
[08:03] directly into Bitcoin um and I did that
[08:06] for about two and a half years and after
[08:08] about three three and a half years and
[08:11] after leaving Unchained I was in a
[08:13] better like that was my at that point it
[08:15] was like top peak of like the second
[08:17] cycle and I was doing really well so I
[08:21] traveled the world was taking care of
[08:22] myself um kind of opening up my own
[08:25] business and then I moved to New York
[08:28] and
[08:30] I moved to New York kind of looking at
[08:31] entrepreneurial opportunities and how to
[08:33] grow my business and kind of get out
[08:34] there but also coming with that came
[08:37] with you know I couldn't um get certain
[08:39] opportunities um in the industry so for
[08:44] me living I had to live off of something
[08:47] and if I didn't have money coming in for
[08:48] me my my cushion was that Bitcoin that I
[08:51] did have and so yeah so for the last two
[08:55] for the last two years I'd like to say
[08:57] with um jobs that I've kind of
[08:59] supplemented some income with when I
[09:01] haven't that stack has been so nice
[09:03] because I can lean on it because it has
[09:05] been growing from like four years ago
[09:08] interesting it it it is something that
[09:11] gives you the power to pursue what you
[09:13] really want to do uh it's um I told I
[09:16] think the story like two three times
[09:18] probably already in a podcast but when I
[09:21] started that podcast I was still in a
[09:23] job and then when I decided to go all in
[09:26] and full time I didn't have the
[09:29] Financial income from the podcast to
[09:31] support myself but I still wanted to do
[09:34] it um because I know I could live off my
[09:37] Bitcoin
[09:39] I uh gladly never had to do that
[09:42] actually and like every each month was a
[09:44] positive month for me uh so I I was
[09:46] lucky and and I was really hardworking
[09:48] to do exactly that but I was prepared to
[09:51] do live off my stack and without that
[09:55] Bitcoin stack I probably wouldn't have
[09:57] done the decision so early maybe
[10:00] wouldn't have done the decision at all H
[10:02] so like it's it's really interesting how
[10:05] um savings and with Bitcoin a stack can
[10:09] actually Empower you to go about your
[10:13] life and figure out what you really want
[10:14] to do uh and it's it's something very
[10:17] powerful I think it's really nice I can
[10:21] agree with that it's different than like
[10:23] if you save that same money in like a
[10:24] bank account right you and I both know
[10:27] that that dollar is depreciating and
[10:29] value especially with just goods and
[10:31] services getting you know increasingly
[10:33] more expensive every day Bitcoin is the
[10:35] opposite so when I moved to New York
[10:37] Bitcoin was around
[10:39] $177,000 um my stack nice stack at that
[10:43] point um for the first six months I
[10:46] think Bitcoin had like risen to like
[10:48] 30,000 is you know and now where it's at
[10:52] at about roughly around 95 to about 100
[10:54] you know living back then at the 17
[10:57] marker versus now you know most people
[10:59] are like oh why would you do that like
[11:00] you were in a bare market right but the
[11:03] whole purpose of that stack is when it's
[11:05] there you can use it even if it's going
[11:08] to gain in value because over the next
[11:10] two like over the next year and a half
[11:11] to two years that stack continue to grow
[11:14] against Fiat so I spent less and less of
[11:17] it for what I actually needed which is
[11:20] the opposite of what you know
[11:22] traditional savings gives you so it does
[11:24] give you that advantage that most people
[11:26] don't have yeah the the the whole
[11:29] narrative around like oh you should
[11:31] never sell your
[11:32] Bitcoin I don't know like I'm I'm not a
[11:35] fan of that yes you can borrow against
[11:37] it yes you can do all all those things
[11:39] uh and I might do that in the future I
[11:41] don't do it currently um but in the end
[11:45] of the day Bitcoin is money and if you
[11:47] use it as your money as you have 100%
[11:50] money um uh you have to spend it like
[11:54] you can still have uh every month more
[11:57] income than than expenses uh but you
[12:01] might have to spend it I mean normal
[12:04] people don't like okay that because I
[12:06] get most of my income in Bitcoin that's
[12:08] why I have to spend it because I get
[12:10] Bitcoin so like I have to use those
[12:13] Bitcoin but normal people uh don't get
[12:15] their uh their income in Bitcoin and so
[12:17] they don't have to spend the Bitcoin if
[12:19] they are cash flow positive uh maybe
[12:21] then you don't have to use Bitcoin in
[12:23] that sense and they can focus on the
[12:24] savings yeah like okay I take it back
[12:26] you can never sell your Bitcoin if you
[12:28] have cash flow POS and still use it as
[12:30] money but in my case I actually get
[12:33] Bitcoin paid so I have to spend them and
[12:36] I have to I have to use it and it's
[12:38] money we we we should use
[12:41] it yeah so there's I feel like a few
[12:43] ways that people can view Bitcoin a lot
[12:45] of people see it as a store of value
[12:47] which you know you heard the like the
[12:49] term hdle and friends don't let their
[12:50] friends sell Bitcoin right huge thing
[12:53] it's why a lot of people also borrow
[12:55] against their Bitcoin you know working
[12:57] at Unchained was amazing because I got
[12:58] to see that firsthand like people who
[13:01] had Stacks that could borrow against
[13:03] their Bitcoin at a 50% LTV ratio and
[13:07] then Contin to be able to pay down on
[13:09] the principal as well as be able to add
[13:12] more Bitcoin if those margin calls were
[13:14] like they had come up um when I had left
[13:17] Unchained and I was in a good financial
[13:19] situation I actually did that myself to
[13:21] kind of Leverage my Bitcoin for you know
[13:24] some extra capital for further
[13:26] Investments whatever I wanted to do and
[13:30] like to say the only downside to that
[13:31] especially if you don't have income
[13:33] coming in or some way to kind of like
[13:35] cushion yourself is that when FTX hit
[13:38] and it went from 60 and it drastically
[13:40] fell I did end up having to sell some of
[13:42] my collateral to cover the loan which
[13:45] you know most people would be like oh
[13:47] why would you do that I mean I mean I
[13:49] put myself in that situation right I
[13:52] won't say that it's against people like
[13:55] I wouldn't say tell people to be against
[13:57] you know putting their Bitcoin in a loan
[13:59] especially if they need that capital and
[14:01] they'd prefer not to sell the Bitcoin
[14:03] for that Capital but be very careful
[14:05] with doing so because there's a few
[14:08] items that you have to keep and be aware
[14:10] of and the last thing you want to do is
[14:13] um be anxious enough that your loan is
[14:15] keeping you up at night is my Bitcoin is
[14:17] it going to fall that hard that um I'm G
[14:21] to have to put in collateral or rely on
[14:23] the current banking system for my wire
[14:25] payments to come in I saw some crazy
[14:28] loan operation there and it was it
[14:30] wasn't saying that like the internal
[14:32] loan operations it's just like the whole
[14:33] loan process right it's like um you're
[14:37] dealing with the traditional financing
[14:39] system with like the banking hours um
[14:42] and then wire payments reaching in time
[14:45] you then have you know the blockchain
[14:47] actually getting really really busy um
[14:50] so if you send a transaction and then it
[14:52] gets busy you're still subjected to that
[14:54] time and either higher fees but you know
[14:57] if you're in a wallet that does doesn't
[14:59] have replaced by fee you're now stuck in
[15:01] that as well right um there were like
[15:06] there were like operational stipulations
[15:08] at unchain like if there was Bitcoin
[15:10] sent on the blockchain but it had not
[15:11] been confirmed yet um it would be kind
[15:15] of put as like a not confirmed but kind
[15:19] of confirmed so you wouldn't be
[15:21] liquidated but then you have the other
[15:23] end where if it doesn't reach in time
[15:25] you are subjected to that liquidation
[15:27] just to cover that basis
[15:29] um I saw two major price drops at
[15:32] Unchained the first was um November 2018
[15:36] and then the second was March of 2020
[15:39] which was probably the craziest one SE
[15:43] like I remember 7 amm I got a call and
[15:46] Bitcoin had dropped from like
[15:48] $177,000 to like
[15:50] $3,000 within like a two-day period and
[15:54] it was wild to see how many people had
[15:56] to like you know put money in or like
[16:00] actually have to think about closing out
[16:01] their loans at that time um you know
[16:04] because the biggest thing is you do not
[16:06] want to lose that stack you if you've
[16:08] worked so hard to put your money into
[16:10] Bitcoin right you know how hard it is to
[16:13] part with that Bitcoin especially if you
[16:16] don't see that value in with that
[16:18] exchange you have more value getting
[16:20] that Bitcoin than if you're going to pay
[16:21] for it or like pay for items with that
[16:24] Bitcoin you're better off using that
[16:25] cash right now because that cash is less
[16:28] valuable um I'm curious what have you
[16:30] learned uh at the time of of in un I
[16:33] think like if you're working hard in in
[16:35] Bitcoin and you're doing like every day
[16:37] to work in there especially in a company
[16:39] that is just 10 employ 10 employees big
[16:42] um in so such an early stage you you
[16:45] learn a lot that you don't think about
[16:48] then that you don't even think about if
[16:50] you're just a Bitcoin or working in a fe
[16:53] a job and and and saving in Bitcoin
[16:55] maybe using Bitcoin and stuff like that
[16:57] and then you're just like on bit podcast
[16:59] seeing it and and on Twitter a little
[17:02] bit uh so like what have you learned in
[17:04] the at the time working for and in
[17:07] Bitcoin I actually learned kind of like
[17:10] for me I was chasing just the knowledge
[17:11] of the ecosystem the whole thing like
[17:13] why why Bitcoin you know I understood
[17:16] that the financial crisis of 2008 but
[17:19] like how bad it was it like the the
[17:21] actual Financial system I think a lot
[17:24] the difference between people working in
[17:25] the industry as well as people who are
[17:27] kind of just bitcoiners working like
[17:29] Fiat jobs is that education business but
[17:32] uh that educational level but then even
[17:34] people who are working in Bitcoin are
[17:36] not fully bitcoiners I worked with
[17:38] people even at unchain that were
[17:41] engineers on the Bitcoin side but are
[17:43] not bitcoiners themselves they they're
[17:46] not fully into Bitcoin the same way um
[17:49] and I think that makes drastic
[17:51] differences like you know the the kind
[17:53] of knowledge that you're chasing um and
[17:56] then how far you want to go it's why
[17:57] people spend you know hundreds of hours
[18:00] learning about Bitcoin on the side
[18:02] versus like some people who would rather
[18:04] go into the industry and learn that
[18:05] stuff handson um you do it at a larger
[18:08] and a faster rapid Pace um especially if
[18:11] you're working in the industry yeah
[18:13] absolutely you you there's a different
[18:16] uh there's a different pace but also
[18:18] there are different learnings in there
[18:20] for example for me um I was really hard
[18:23] toxic uh against for example any that
[18:26] was KC anything that was not Bitcoin
[18:30] right before when I started the podcast
[18:32] now I'm seeing the industry more
[18:37] realistic of like of course there will
[18:40] come um regulations in there where the
[18:44] intersection of fear and Bitcoin comes
[18:47] it's fine like if you want to be
[18:48] completely private you have that option
[18:51] in Bitcoin and that's amazing like you
[18:52] can be uh you can buy nonky Bitcoin on a
[18:55] local Bitcoin Meetup against uh Fiat
[18:58] cash
[18:59] that's that's the most private way to do
[19:01] it um and you can uh completely be offit
[19:06] in in that sense but if we want to reach
[19:09] Mass
[19:10] adoption that's that should not be the
[19:13] only option we we have to have KC
[19:16] exchanges we have to have a Bitcoin ETF
[19:18] we have to have all those financial
[19:20] products that the core eforce of
[19:24] Hardcore bitcoiners maybe don't want um
[19:27] but Bitcoin is for everyone and that's
[19:30] what uh sometimes the hardcore group
[19:32] doesn't get like also the our enemies
[19:35] also the bad institutions also the feat
[19:37] money also those get to play in Bitcoin
[19:40] and they will play in Bitcoin and it's a
[19:42] good thing not a bad thing so that I
[19:45] think that's a major thing that that I
[19:47] have learned uh working in Bitcoin I
[19:51] mean I don't know I don't know if I work
[19:52] in Bitcoin I I I I talk with bitcoiners
[19:56] and I get paid for that like I don't
[19:57] know if that's that's that qualifies as
[20:00] as working uh for Bitcoin uh but like I
[20:03] I make educational content or and or
[20:05] entertainment content whatever people
[20:07] get out of the podcast uh for that but
[20:09] that that's what I basically learned
[20:11] from it that's what why I was curious of
[20:14] of like asking you of like um because
[20:16] you you came into Bitcoin before you
[20:20] worked in in Bitcoin if I understand
[20:22] that correct right sort of I got a job
[20:26] at a um just like I got a CMO job at a
[20:30] startup that had like four other people
[20:32] and um the literally I got the job
[20:35] knowing nothing about Bitcoin and so
[20:37] then I was supposed to go market about
[20:39] Bitcoin um and so April of 2016 I
[20:43] remember getting on the Bitcoin Twitter
[20:45] and I was like all I kept hearing is
[20:46] Bitcoin Twitter Bitcoin Twitter I was
[20:48] like okay this is where I'm getting my
[20:49] Bitcoin knowledge and it was it was
[20:51] still very minimal like you could barely
[20:53] find
[20:55] non-technical um documentation in
[20:58] literature on bitcoin it was more
[21:00] educational based and more like
[21:02] technical so you know you had to learn
[21:05] um more of like the technology behind it
[21:08] um versus like the more economical stuff
[21:11] which I think came out more in like 2018
[21:13] that's super interesting you had to you
[21:15] basically had to learn Bitcoin through
[21:17] your job I think that's a very uncommon
[21:20] way to for someone to get orange
[21:22] P yeah yeah you're not wrong um I people
[21:28] come into people find their own ways
[21:29] into Bitcoin you know I got my dad into
[21:31] Bitcoin he's double Finance background
[21:34] um I went up to him I remember I called
[21:37] him I was like hey uh because we have
[21:39] that this kind of like business e
[21:40] relationship I was like hey I'm gonna
[21:42] start this job and it's about Bitcoin um
[21:45] what do you think he's like I don't have
[21:47] enough information about that but we had
[21:50] always talked about like the stock
[21:51] market also didn't make sense right and
[21:54] so when I learned about Bitcoin and got
[21:56] into it a little bit more and I was
[21:57] starting to you know feed him in bits of
[22:01] in of information about it from a
[22:03] non-technical perspective and then I
[22:05] remember he came back to me and told me
[22:07] about ethereum and then we just went
[22:09] down that rabbit hole of just like alts
[22:12] together um I wouldn't say like my
[22:14] knowledge is more um you know indepth
[22:17] like I like to know exactly what I'm
[22:19] getting involved in some people like the
[22:21] more over the surface level stuff the
[22:24] more economical ba like stuff there's
[22:26] like so many different like key
[22:28] components of Bitcoin you can really
[22:30] just find one that works well for you or
[22:32] something you are interested in learning
[22:34] and go down that rabbit hole and
[22:37] eventually you'll end up touching other
[22:39] key Point like part parts of Bitcoin
[22:42] because you know if you go from the you
[22:44] know the financial perspective of
[22:46] Bitcoin like I'm going to make a little
[22:47] bit of money off of this right then you
[22:50] go down a step further of like I'm
[22:51] putting money into this every like every
[22:53] week whether it's on Swan or I'm buying
[22:56] it on an exchange um whatever and then
[23:00] be like all right I I've heard that
[23:02] exchanges aren't that great it's been
[23:04] about a year I have the stack I can
[23:07] either you know learn about custody
[23:09] myself or just continue down that route
[23:11] of keeping it on an exchange right and
[23:15] and that's what I think is intriguing
[23:16] about people who um you know are like
[23:19] wanting to learn is like you you can go
[23:22] as far as you're willing to push
[23:24] yourself no one's going to push you any
[23:25] further in my education business I've
[23:27] learned especially on social media you
[23:30] can't convince anyone to learn about
[23:31] Bitcoin people will only learn when
[23:33] they're willing to learn and have that
[23:35] conversation because you can't convince
[23:37] someone who's already walking into a
[23:39] wall and won't like you know kind of go
[23:41] around some like a part where they're
[23:44] not like consistently walking into that
[23:46] wall right like they're open to hearing
[23:48] and talking about different points that
[23:51] challenge the knowledge that they know
[23:53] and I think a lot of Bitcoin mindsets
[23:54] around challenging a lot of what we have
[23:57] learned to know
[24:00] yeah it's about that that pain point
[24:01] that people need uh like if if if they
[24:04] don't experience the problem uh they're
[24:08] unlikely to discover the solution even
[24:12] though there are a lot of people that
[24:13] wouldn't need Bitcoin really um but they
[24:17] still discovered it because they have a
[24:20] they're more sensitive towards a problem
[24:23] like prime example is probably Michael
[24:25] sailor he he was well off before Bitcoin
[24:28] he did didn't need Bitcoin he was he was
[24:30] going towards retirement he the plans
[24:33] for him to step down as a CEO was was
[24:36] before he even discovered Bitcoin so he
[24:39] definitely didn't need to discover
[24:41] Bitcoin he just like he had a he has a
[24:44] an amazing mansion in in Miami he has
[24:46] yachs he has businesses he has
[24:48] everything he he wants uh he could just
[24:51] like live off that like for the rest of
[24:53] his life he doesn't even have kids so he
[24:55] doesn't even need to do it for them
[24:59] but um he is more sensitive to those uh
[25:03] to those um trends that come into place
[25:08] and he was seeing that his stack of
[25:13] financial energy was melting and melting
[25:15] and melting and he was like oh like
[25:18] what's happening there uh especially
[25:20] with Co going on and then he searched
[25:22] for Solution that's how I discovered
[25:24] Bitcoin but usually uh like you you need
[25:29] to have a problem and you need to be
[25:30] aware of that problem otherwise you like
[25:33] in your wall example uh you need to run
[25:36] against the wall and you need to be
[25:38] aware that you run against the wall some
[25:41] people are not aware that they run
[25:42] against the
[25:43] wall not at all um I think that's
[25:47] something that most people don't
[25:48] recognize but that that's also
[25:50] recognizing that like people have to
[25:51] recognize that their education is not
[25:53] fully everything that they know right
[25:56] like I'm I've been in Bitcoin for8 years
[25:58] years coming up on nine years in April
[26:00] and I'm always learning I'm constant
[26:02] learning constantly learning I learn
[26:04] from your podcast all the time I learn
[26:06] from the people that I interact with
[26:08] because everyone comes into Bitcoin with
[26:10] different perspectives and different
[26:12] knowledge that they can share and you
[26:13] know help other people with I have a
[26:16] good friend Dan um bitcoiner here works
[26:19] at pubkey um from the marketing side and
[26:22] he's so knowledgeable on the lightning
[26:25] side like super knowledgeable on the
[26:27] lightning side I'm very knowledgeable on
[26:29] the self- custody side so I whenever I
[26:31] have questions or I need help with
[26:32] anything I can go towards him for those
[26:34] answers right I could also go online
[26:38] online I've done my research online for
[26:40] uh for lightning but you know research
[26:42] online also only takes you as far and
[26:44] then you have to go the level of
[26:46] Hands-On and experiencing that yourself
[26:49] because you know true knowledge comes
[26:50] from actually being able to get things
[26:52] done and taking action rather than just
[26:55] like you know sitting and
[26:56] consuming absolutely yeah it's it's um
[27:00] I'm actually curious with with someone
[27:02] like you that that worked since since
[27:04] basically the starting in in Bitcoin and
[27:07] coming up on the nine years what is
[27:09] something you've learned in the in the I
[27:11] don't know the past half year or year in
[27:14] in Bitcoin what is there to to still
[27:17] gain in knowledge in
[27:19] Bitcoin uh definitely what's been
[27:22] changing and adapting in the industry so
[27:24] I got to a lot of the networking events
[27:26] here in New York City um and I've been
[27:28] to a couple of conferences just around
[27:31] um so you learn from people's
[27:33] experiences you learn from what people
[27:35] are you know working on right now how
[27:38] they are driving Bitcoin adoption in
[27:39] their own way whether that's mining um
[27:42] custody options um payment um conversion
[27:46] into Bitcoin um I think it's really
[27:50] unique the way that people are you know
[27:53] taking their knowledge from before and
[27:56] kind of driving Bitcoin adoption going
[27:58] forward there's always room for people
[28:01] to continue to grow that Ian I don't
[28:03] think there's ever going to be a point
[28:05] where someone has all of that knowledge
[28:08] because the industry is so new right
[28:10] that even in the 15 16 years that it's
[28:13] going to keep um you know adapting and
[28:16] accelerating so does your knowledge is
[28:18] GNA have to keep doing that with it I
[28:20] you know last time I worked with an
[28:21] actual startup was four years ago right
[28:24] and that has changed drastically since
[28:27] then um um but it's only changed so much
[28:30] because that knowledge still stays the
[28:31] same like the Baseline everything after
[28:33] that has changed right you have now you
[28:35] have institutional custody multi-
[28:37] signature custody I didn't even consider
[28:39] that and when when I did consider that
[28:41] that was more of me thinking of it in
[28:42] terms of like Banks doing that for their
[28:44] clients rather than like you know a
[28:46] company actually coming out and doing
[28:48] solely Bitcoin institutional custody for
[28:51] um Fiat companies or companies who are
[28:53] interested in getting into Bitcoin
[28:55] that's super interesting yeah it's it's
[28:57] it's all like
[28:58] there are some some fundamental things
[29:00] that will probably never or barely
[29:03] change uh in terms of in Bitcoin but
[29:07] also in business on on startups and like
[29:10] whatever um and then there are like the
[29:12] nuances the details where it's like gets
[29:14] really interesting uh I think what right
[29:18] now I think like the the whole how to
[29:21] scale Bitcoin and and and where are we
[29:23] going with layer twos and layer 3es I
[29:25] think that's the probably the most
[29:27] unsure
[29:28] uh thing I think we fixed the main layer
[29:31] kind of like we we figured out uh more
[29:34] and more how to store it we figured out
[29:36] more and more how the main layer is
[29:38] working um now more and more people have
[29:41] Bitcoin more and more people probably
[29:43] will want to spend the Bitcoin down the
[29:45] road and then you don't want to pay a
[29:47] th000 EUR for transaction fees now they
[29:49] are way lower like now transaction is
[29:51] almost costing nothing uh but like uh if
[29:54] if Bitcoin continues like probably
[29:56] transactions will be at some point Point
[29:58] very expensive so how do we figure out
[30:01] that uh transactions not costing
[30:04] $500 but uh you can actually move up
[30:07] layers and and and do that have you have
[30:10] you probably have gone down the the
[30:12] rabbit hole of of scaling Bitcoin as you
[30:14] uh Al on the technical side yeah I think
[30:16] that comes with infrastructure for sure
[30:18] um you know when I was in when I first
[30:21] initially got into Bitcoin you you
[30:23] couldn't really pay for anything
[30:24] lightning was really around mov to New
[30:27] York and you go to Pub Key and pay for
[30:29] your beer and your burger with lightning
[30:32] right the biggest thing though is how do
[30:34] you go from onchain lightning to um
[30:38] onchain Bitcoin to lightning Bitcoin I
[30:40] think that's the biggest thing because
[30:41] most people do not earn in lightning
[30:43] Bitcoin right most people ear earn in
[30:45] onchain Bitcoin exchanges are onchain
[30:48] Bitcoin and then you have that curve of
[30:50] going from onchain to lightning I think
[30:52] we'll see a lot of people um I think
[30:55] we'll see a lot of adoption rapidly
[30:57] occur when we have a lot more people
[30:58] holding lightning Bitcoin or having
[31:01] spendable Bitcoin that's more on like
[31:03] one of the uh layer twos um and that's
[31:06] mainly because like you said on chain
[31:09] it's it's just so expensive and then
[31:12] even as we get later on with all those
[31:14] people you you want to have something
[31:16] that settles quickly right so some
[31:19] lightning like a layer two like
[31:21] lightning would be very useful for that
[31:23] so going back to like the recycling for
[31:25] Bitcoin idea the idea was you know you
[31:28] have beverage cans and water bottles
[31:30] that people use all the time and it's
[31:32] easy to recycle and it's easy to
[31:34] actually get into a circular system and
[31:37] it has a very small value to it whether
[31:40] that's a scrap value or a value that's
[31:43] put on to it by legislation in New York
[31:45] state it's actually a 5-cent deposit for
[31:47] every bottle that you buy so you know
[31:50] there's so much money for those five
[31:52] cents that actually you know some people
[31:55] go and collect the five cents per can in
[31:57] Fiat it hasn't changed in over 42 years
[32:00] in the Fiat like 5 cents for one can for
[32:03] 42
[32:04] years Bitcoin does the opposite of that
[32:07] because me and you both know that the
[32:08] dollar diminishes of purchasing power
[32:11] while Bitcoin does the opposite so
[32:13] giving people the option to earn in
[32:16] Bitcoin um with something as small a
[32:19] value as you know cans or bottles gives
[32:22] people the um ability to earn very small
[32:26] amounts of spendable Bitcoin through a
[32:28] layer two when you get more people like
[32:31] that to have a layer two um Bitcoin that
[32:34] you can instantly transact then you're
[32:36] looking at more people moving to a
[32:38] Bitcoin standard because then you know
[32:39] you'd have people sending venm modes um
[32:42] PayPal versions of that right you
[32:44] wouldn't have people being like Oh can I
[32:47] pay you in Bitcoin because like I my
[32:49] most my friends are on the Fiat standard
[32:51] I'm on a Bitcoin standard if I pay my
[32:53] friends back for something I have to
[32:55] convert it back into cash before I send
[32:57] it to them right like most my friends
[32:59] aren't going to take that Bitcoin but
[33:01] some people will take that Bitcoin
[33:03] especially if we're living on a Bitcoin
[33:04] standard and they can use that Bitcoin
[33:06] later on or within the next couple of
[33:09] months I partnered up with coin
[33:12] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[33:15] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[33:18] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[33:21] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[33:24] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[33:27] subtle and ENT way to go out there and
[33:30] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[33:32] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[33:36] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[33:38] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[33:42] watch collections you have the date of
[33:44] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[33:47] there and of course also the block
[33:49] height and which EPO we are currently in
[33:53] I love the level of detail they put in
[33:56] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[33:58] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[34:01] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[34:04] love those watches so so much if you
[34:07] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[34:09] regular basis I'll guess you already
[34:11] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[34:14] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[34:17] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[34:20] personal recommendation for Hardware
[34:21] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[34:24] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[34:26] gift for a friend who has still the
[34:29] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[34:32] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[34:35] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[34:39] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[34:42] to really level up your sovereignty as
[34:44] an individual you have to have the most
[34:47] secure self custody setup you have to
[34:49] secure your own devices you have to
[34:52] protect your privacy you have to set up
[34:55] an inheritance plan and depending on
[34:58] where you live you even want to have a
[35:00] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[35:03] in case something goes really really
[35:05] wrong and through all those steps the
[35:06] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[35:10] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[35:12] way.com
[35:13] Partners SL Robin you even get a 30
[35:16] minute free call to find out how you can
[35:19] level up your sovereignty that's
[35:22] interesting yeah like there's so many
[35:23] implications of of like uh the the
[35:26] current system of of where where we
[35:29] spend it because like I'm actually in
[35:32] the in the process of figuring that out
[35:34] I'm I I didn't sell any Bitcoin except
[35:38] of some some small lightning it's
[35:40] probably like in total under $500 uh 500
[35:43] euros uh but in I think I probably have
[35:48] to start in the second half of this year
[35:50] to to start spending my my Bitcoin
[35:52] because like as I said beginning like
[35:55] the income in Bitcoin and stuff like
[35:56] that um and I'm trying to figure out the
[35:59] best way to do that and it feels like
[36:02] moving once a quarter um or like once a
[36:07] month money on a lightning wallet from
[36:10] there some sort of card is connected
[36:14] that I instantly can pay in Euros with a
[36:17] credit card and then uh you spend the
[36:20] this lightning stack feels like probably
[36:23] the best move but there are so many
[36:25] questions in in that well like H how do
[36:28] I how do I spend Bitcoin right now in
[36:32] instill that Fiat system that we that we
[36:35] live in and there are more and more uh
[36:38] companies and and cards like bit
[36:41] refillers I think like someone that
[36:43] almost everyone knows uh in Europe I
[36:45] don't know if they're available in
[36:47] America but in Europe they're available
[36:48] is bring in uh they they're doing a
[36:51] great job bull Bitcoin has some great
[36:53] features around that uh and and probably
[36:56] like 50 other comp that I don't know
[36:58] about so it it gets more and more but
[37:00] it's it's still it's still still small
[37:03] part of the industry I feel like I can
[37:05] agree with that
[37:07] um the the thing with like lightning is
[37:11] that we're so early right now right and
[37:14] most people aren't going to you know
[37:16] take lightning to be able to go pay
[37:17] their bills I think the biggest thing is
[37:19] the infrastructure right so if I wanted
[37:21] to pay my rent my landlord only takes
[37:23] cash right or whatever Fiat payment it
[37:26] is and so
[37:28] like you said it's that conversion from
[37:30] Bitcoin to cash and right now the only
[37:33] way to do that is either you borrow off
[37:35] that Bitcoin right to get that capital
[37:38] or you sell that Bitcoin for that cash
[37:41] and in doing so at least in the United
[37:43] States you're now you you have your
[37:46] capital gains taxes plus then all those
[37:48] fees from the exchanges and then having
[37:50] to send that over um living off of
[37:53] Bitcoin is it's great but you know it
[37:56] doesn't it it comes with a lot of
[37:58] nuances that most people I don't think
[38:00] recognize which is that conversion and
[38:02] then the extra fees on top of that yeah
[38:05] do you think lightning is still
[38:07] replaceable do you think like we we will
[38:09] have a a uh add Layer Two in lightning
[38:12] will not play any role honestly I have
[38:14] no idea I can't really speak to that I
[38:17] think Lightning's made its um kind of
[38:20] Debut and it's been working really well
[38:22] if there's a layer two that can come
[38:25] through that reduces the amount of steps
[38:28] that lightning has right like you have
[38:30] to learn how to you know issue invoices
[38:33] then the QR code code for those invoices
[38:37] um lightning also has um different um
[38:41] technical routes so you have like Ln
[38:43] URLs um if some if like a layer two can
[38:48] come out and kind of match that and then
[38:50] also make it easier for consumers or an
[38:53] everyday non-technical bitcoiners I
[38:56] that's where I would see um a later two
[38:59] dominating yeah like you have to you you
[39:02] have to nail uh being as decentralized
[39:05] as possible as native to bitcoin as
[39:07] possible uh but also the user experience
[39:10] is really important especially on Layer
[39:12] Two um way more than on on layer one
[39:15] it's it's super interesting um as
[39:17] someone that's been since almost nine
[39:19] years in in in in Bitcoin what what do
[39:22] you think about the current cycle like
[39:24] uh that that we basically just started
[39:25] in in last year uh uh it it seems it
[39:29] feels so different with nation states
[39:31] and institutional money in it it feels
[39:33] so so so different as before it is very
[39:36] different uh I think a lot of people
[39:38] have been waiting for that institutional
[39:40] money to come through um and then now
[39:43] that that money has come through it's
[39:44] kind of like that mindset is like oh all
[39:46] of these institutions and these
[39:48] governments are going to start hoarding
[39:49] large amounts of Bitcoin right so now
[39:52] that's where a lot of the like you know
[39:54] Bitcoin comes off the market um you know
[39:57] which would push essentially demand for
[40:01] higher prices because Supply is so
[40:03] limited um but at the same time I do
[40:06] think a lot of people kind of still
[40:08] think they're very late into Bitcoin
[40:10] because they haven't recognized the
[40:12] value of Bitcoin yet um as far as like
[40:16] inst like this cycle I think is still
[40:19] just getting started but you know with
[40:22] where our current economical system is
[40:26] and what's going on with the government
[40:29] right now you have no idea where the
[40:31] price is going to go right like I I know
[40:33] a lot of people talk about like price of
[40:35] Bitcoin this cycle even last cycle no
[40:38] one thought that Bitcoin was going to
[40:40] top out at 69,000 every thought everyone
[40:42] thought it was going to hit at least
[40:43] 100K right was not the case this year or
[40:48] yeah this cycle we finally had hit a
[40:49] 100K and I know people are predicting
[40:51] 250k right but then again I think it's I
[40:55] think Cycles are based off of people's
[40:58] ability to be able to use it in like the
[41:01] day-to-day as well as you know what's
[41:03] going on in the industry so you have to
[41:06] pay attention to the things that are
[41:08] coming into place for legislation the
[41:10] Bitcoin strategic reserves for the
[41:12] states huge um so when states start to
[41:16] hold their own Bitcoin reserves I think
[41:18] that's going to be massive especially
[41:20] because now that's allowing people to in
[41:22] their own states to custody Bitcoin
[41:25] right um from A bank's perspective but
[41:29] then if if a state is holding Bitcoin
[41:33] you're going to have you're want to open
[41:35] up the state's ability to be able to use
[41:37] Bitcoin as a payment system at some
[41:40] point so I think there this cycle sets
[41:42] us up for another four years of
[41:45] technological adoption um in a more
[41:48] societal way but I don't think it's
[41:50] going to come as rapidly as a lot of
[41:52] people think because it still comes with
[41:54] onboarding people to not just think of
[41:56] Bitcoin as you know use Bitcoin as a
[41:58] store value but also use it as a
[41:59] payments and I think most people are
[42:01] going to use payment payment uh Bitcoin
[42:03] as a payments if they are only holding
[42:07] Bitcoin right that they living on a
[42:09] Bitcoin standard or secondly they have
[42:12] enough Capital under their belt that
[42:15] they can use that Bitcoin for those
[42:18] daily payments or those
[42:21] day-to-day yeah like if if you have
[42:24] feared you you spend fear
[42:27] you you don't spend your Bitcoin if you
[42:29] have feat available like spend spending
[42:32] Bitcoin is only good for people that
[42:35] have no more fear left to to to to spend
[42:39] and yeah it's it's it will come
[42:43] eventually I feel like and we do are uh
[42:47] it it seems weird but we are still so
[42:50] early H and and people have a hard time
[42:53] grasping how early we actually are and
[42:57] that the first 15 years 16 years was
[42:59] just to build some sort of
[43:02] foundation uh and and now it's actually
[43:05] kind of studying uh the whole adoption
[43:08] the whole institutional thing the whole
[43:10] um like remember back when you first
[43:14] started with Bitcoin it was probably so
[43:16] hard to even buy
[43:19] Bitcoin and and to learn about Bitcoin
[43:21] and to do all those things that you can
[43:23] do now it it's it's it's really an
[43:25] exponential growth curve
[43:27] oh yeah think about the number of books
[43:29] that have come out right like I Parker
[43:32] Lewis's gradually then suddenly was just
[43:35] starting out when um he was just
[43:37] starting to write those articles when I
[43:39] was working with at unchain unchain so
[43:41] you know there's so much that has
[43:43] changed over my time having joined the
[43:46] industry that it's great to see because
[43:49] you know like no matter what you're
[43:52] going to spend those hours learning
[43:53] whether that's deep diving into like the
[43:56] technical aspect or finding more things
[43:58] that are like less technical um I am
[44:02] talking to this Venture Studios for one
[44:04] of my startups and um they were asking
[44:07] because they were looking at issuing
[44:09] tokens for their own um companies and
[44:13] you know one two the two partners one's
[44:16] more Technical and one's very
[44:18] non-technical so it's also finding
[44:20] resources right for the different levels
[44:23] of learning so that they can also come
[44:25] to a very similar understanding
[44:27] that wasn't the case back then um I got
[44:30] so I got into the industry in
[44:33] 2016 then summer of 2017 I joined um a
[44:39] an nft company um they were issuing nfts
[44:42] on Open Seas in rable back uh for my my
[44:47] project was actually for the Lucha
[44:49] underground wrestlers um and so I helped
[44:52] you know put nfts into the market and
[44:54] then I transitioned over to Bitcoin and
[44:57] M ethereum multi-sig custody so you
[45:01] really can just like go down whatever
[45:02] Rabbit Hole you desire you know some
[45:04] people don't even some people see
[45:06] Bitcoin and they're like but look at
[45:07] this whole other world of like crypto in
[45:09] this other Avenue right so people then
[45:12] go down web 3 and blockchain and um
[45:16] whatever else is like the realm of
[45:18] crypto but you can like you can
[45:21] definitely separate the two because you
[45:22] have one that has like store of value
[45:26] with something that's long term I do
[45:28] think crypto is necessary and will
[45:30] continue to be around but I think of it
[45:32] as more of like in like the terms of
[45:34] stocks rather than in the term of like
[45:38] actual value um like the US dollar H H
[45:42] but how is it
[45:43] necessary what do you mean like how is
[45:46] crypto necessary outside of Bitcoin I
[45:49] got you um so I kind of think as crypto
[45:53] is necessary in terms of like being
[45:56] similar stocks
[45:58] but how do I put this crypto is
[46:01] necessary for
[46:05] like the blockchain transparency and
[46:09] then also being able to be early um in
[46:13] companies like you would with stocks but
[46:15] the only difference with stocks is that
[46:17] you have kind of like that background
[46:19] before and you're issuing to a public
[46:21] market versus crypto where you are
[46:23] issuing tokens and hoping that those
[46:25] tokens will have utility I do think that
[46:28] there are some cryptos that do have
[46:29] utility and it's necessary to drive like
[46:32] specific industry whether that's Health
[46:34] um you know gamification whatever that
[46:37] is but I don't think it's necessary for
[46:40] driving Bitcoin adoption because you
[46:42] know most people who go into altcoins
[46:45] and shitcoins right you know most people
[46:48] want your Bitcoin that's that's the
[46:49] whole purpose of it so you see it as
[46:52] raising capital for projects and and and
[46:56] compan is in in in the in the future I
[46:58] mean that's what it is
[47:00] now right but also crypto's a lot of
[47:04] like scams right you have a lot of
[47:06] people who are just issuing tokens to
[47:08] raise capital and then pulling out right
[47:11] you know there's that one kid that got
[47:13] rug pulled that rug pulled on a live
[47:15] stream you have the current sitting
[47:18] president who issued meeme tokens um I
[47:22] mean those I don't think are necessary
[47:23] crypto tokens but I do think that stuff
[47:25] like chain link and so
[47:27] are um cryptos that are actually
[47:30] contributing value from a technical
[47:33] perspective like
[47:34] blockchain I never get why like what
[47:37] what are they contributing because like
[47:39] if if you say like there's a market for
[47:43] we we have a different method of raising
[47:45] Capital uh for for companies that's a
[47:49] leged point for me because like I I
[47:51] think the stock market is is great but I
[47:55] I would love to see um being able to
[47:59] invest in in companies way earlier like
[48:02] see like having a private company and
[48:05] being able to actually be involved in
[48:08] that um the the green green mining Dow
[48:11] or like how they called they actually
[48:13] doing that like it's it's not like if if
[48:16] if you buy uh uh uh from them um they
[48:22] actually issue in Switzerland like
[48:24] actual shares of their company like they
[48:27] they have connected that um feared world
[48:31] or and the legal world the the kind of
[48:35] the reality of that with actual um uh
[48:39] shares they did it somehow with Bitcoin
[48:41] ordinance like don't don't don't ask me
[48:43] technical specifications of that but
[48:46] that this was interesting for me because
[48:48] this gives
[48:49] people um the security of not being Rock
[48:52] pulled uh and also a new way of raising
[48:59] Capital but other than that like I I
[49:02] don't like I don't you want to
[49:04] decentralized then you go to bitcoin uh
[49:07] or or you don't care about
[49:09] decentralization that much then why not
[49:13] a database that's more more efficient
[49:16] and there's the transparency of it um
[49:19] but uh do you need really need
[49:21] transparency in a video game or
[49:23] something like that like it's just like
[49:26] I have a lot of questions of the of the
[49:30] necess necessity of any altcoin actually
[49:34] that's fair I guess it depends on
[49:35] exactly what they're choosing to um you
[49:39] know fix per se or like whatever issue
[49:42] they're tackling um like inoperability
[49:44] like the difference between different
[49:47] bit uh blockchains being able to talk to
[49:49] each other right I kind of equate
[49:52] interop
[49:55] interoperability it's a word
[49:57] um with you know having different like
[49:59] banking servers talking to each other
[50:01] right they're all privatized right the
[50:04] only way that chase is going to talk to
[50:06] Fidelity is if um you know their servers
[50:10] are going to talk to each other but
[50:12] there there's something there I don't
[50:13] know the technical thing behind it but
[50:15] interoperability allows for these like
[50:17] you know separate servers these separate
[50:20] blockchains to be able to talk to each
[50:22] other um I actually am more Bitcoin
[50:26] Focus focused I know I my account is
[50:28] fluid cryptos because I do you know I
[50:31] have a um background with you know
[50:34] ethereum and other cryptos but through a
[50:37] lot of my education I had continuously
[50:39] kept coming back to bitcoin
[50:42] because cryp crypto's great to make
[50:45] money but if you want to build wealth
[50:48] and something that's lasting Bitcoin is
[50:51] the better way especially if you want
[50:53] something that's more hands off rather
[50:55] than handson I think a lot of people who
[50:57] are in crypto do a lot of trading rather
[51:00] than like long-term holding because when
[51:02] you look at the Cycles most cryptos
[51:04] don't last most cycles and in they if
[51:08] they do Bitcoin still outperforms every
[51:11] crypto yeah it's
[51:14] like it feels like the the longer you
[51:17] are in in in Bitcoin and crypto the more
[51:21] you come back to bitcoin like I
[51:24] completely pushed away any crypto so
[51:26] once I realized um I have to actually
[51:30] look at what they're doing and I have to
[51:33] actually keep up with that pace uh and
[51:36] then I pushed them away and then I was
[51:39] like okay but if it's some leged great
[51:42] Innovation I should I should actually
[51:44] buy them even if I have to look into the
[51:46] news and stuff like that and then I was
[51:48] like okay but it does not make sense for
[51:50] me um for me from a technical
[51:53] perspective blockchain is quite
[51:55] inefficient
[51:57] that's like more efficient way to save
[51:59] data and then it's like okay you need a
[52:01] really good reason to use that techn
[52:04] technology um Bitcoin is one of those
[52:07] really good reasons um and I haven't
[52:09] discovered a good one other than that
[52:12] there's this whole uh supply chain thing
[52:14] also um it also doesn't make sense for
[52:17] me you can make the same thing with a
[52:19] centralized database and a QR code um
[52:23] and it's basically the same security um
[52:26] because because you may with with
[52:29] blockchain you have the the thing of
[52:31] like it's being
[52:33] irreversible um most likely irreversible
[52:36] depending on how it's controlled um but
[52:40] uh you can you still have the problem of
[52:42] like who who who puts the information on
[52:44] it if it's not natively on the
[52:47] blockchain uh the the the Oracle problem
[52:50] the the banana on the thing so um video
[52:54] games are interesting that's actually
[52:56] something that I invested in in the past
[52:58] I completely push it away
[53:00] now but I was
[53:03] also they they will choose the most
[53:05] efficient way to do that and we already
[53:09] have skins uh we already have um tokens
[53:12] in in video games uh I believe before
[53:15] crypto we already had those things um
[53:19] and I I don't see the reason why it has
[53:22] to be an an actual blockchain do so um
[53:26] but also and this actually I became less
[53:28] toxic against altcoins uh in in me
[53:31] having a podcast because I became more
[53:34] more a free market maximalist where I'm
[53:36] like if they prove to have a value um
[53:41] they deserve to be around um I don't
[53:44] think they have a value so I I do think
[53:47] they will go away but if they are if if
[53:50] people choose to spend money and time in
[53:52] those projects maybe there's value that
[53:55] I don't see
[53:57] uh but yeah we'll see long term if it
[54:00] checks out um if you say Bitcoin focused
[54:03] what what what do you mean by that like
[54:05] you you have like a a small 5% stack
[54:07] where you gamble in in other ones or
[54:09] like uh what is your definition of
[54:12] Bitcoin
[54:13] Focus um well Bitcoin Focus for me was
[54:16] uh you know I got I 100% started with
[54:19] Bitcoin then I took that stack and I
[54:24] moved it into ethereum and ALT that
[54:26] first cycle drastically learned how bad
[54:29] that could be very quickly in the 2018
[54:32] time frame then you know the next cycle
[54:35] I played around with it again but very
[54:39] very like you know I had more knowledge
[54:41] behind me with you know custody
[54:44] and um more Bitcoin related things
[54:47] behind me and then I that's when I
[54:50] realized I was like you know if I'm not
[54:52] paying attention to the projects that
[54:54] I'm investing in I don't want want to be
[54:56] a part of it and you know this was
[54:59] around the time like Celsius had um kind
[55:02] of had its SEC issue that I recognized
[55:06] that like cryptos are great because they
[55:09] have um at that time I was like oh
[55:11] cryptos are great because they gain in
[55:13] value the more that people are
[55:15] absolutely using them or using that
[55:17] service like Celsius the more people use
[55:20] celsius the greater the token for
[55:22] Celsius became for price right and then
[55:26] as the price of Bitcoin fell the token
[55:29] of Celsius also fell even if you still
[55:33] had that many people on the platform
[55:36] right or more people on the platform the
[55:39] the part that didn't the part that
[55:41] worried me the most was when crypto fell
[55:45] like tokens fell harder um after Bitcoin
[55:48] fell and that was where that where I had
[55:52] a lack of discon or I had a
[55:54] disconnection because I was like I can't
[55:56] have a token falling like
[55:59] 90% well even if Bitcoin fell 90% And
[56:02] this token's falling 90% right and it
[56:04] still has the same number of user base
[56:07] um I just didn't see the value in
[56:10] continuing with like I wasn't in Celcius
[56:12] but I'm using Celsius as an example
[56:14] right like it they did they gave loans
[56:17] how this they gave loans and in those
[56:19] loans if the token valuation fell you
[56:21] know less people have loans more people
[56:24] are getting like called a lot of people
[56:26] people are getting liquidated and so for
[56:28] me it's like that value of what was
[56:30] created instantly went away because the
[56:33] token had lost value I don't I don't I'm
[56:36] not in alts anymore um maybe very rarely
[56:40] few here and there I did a blockchain
[56:43] hackathon a year and a half ago where I
[56:45] earned near as the payout um it's near
[56:49] blockchain as a frontend um blockchain
[56:52] so you can code and then on the back end
[56:55] is a a it's a blockchain um that's a
[56:59] it's a
[57:01] carbon zero carbon um blockchain so it's
[57:04] supposed to not admit it's supposed to
[57:06] be better than you know other
[57:08] blockchains that have like a carbon
[57:11] footprint then again I don't I didn't go
[57:13] into like the depths of like all of what
[57:15] the near blockchain had to offer right
[57:18] for me I just saw it as a way for me to
[57:21] kind of get my foot in the door for
[57:23] something else but then I went back into
[57:25] Bitcoin like these projects are these
[57:28] projects are helpful because they offer
[57:30] use cases um to things that we
[57:33] traditionally wouldn't see use cases for
[57:36] but that's not to say that they're use
[57:37] cases that are necessary um some some
[57:41] blockchains are necessary for their
[57:43] industry or whatever they're in yeah the
[57:45] zero emission is interesting uh uh like
[57:48] you know from who which car maker is it
[57:52] Nissan uh like some electric vehicle
[57:55] producers are
[57:56] putting um on back of their vehicle zero
[58:01] emission be because they're electric um
[58:04] uh and and and the same thing is is is
[58:07] is for me uh like like that like if if
[58:10] something says like zero Mission or like
[58:13] something of those screen washing things
[58:14] I'm like I'm getting getting H like this
[58:18] raises a lot of red flags for me I've
[58:21] not looked into the project at all but
[58:24] if if you claim to have zero emissions
[58:28] um you mostly try to um have like most
[58:32] altcoins try to pick one thing that is
[58:35] not perfect with Bitcoin because it has
[58:37] to make a compromise and exploit that
[58:40] and think this is the next Bitcoin I
[58:42] hear that all the time uh when when
[58:45] friends and and family and and and yeah
[58:48] just random people approach me like oh
[58:51] but I found that one coin and it it
[58:53] improves the scalability of Bitcoin and
[58:55] it will be the next Bitcoin I'm like no
[58:57] like you don't get it like it won't be
[58:59] the next Bitcoin Bitcoin you you can
[59:02] copy the Bitcoin code right now improve
[59:05] one thing and nobody will use it and
[59:08] nobody will buy your token Bitcoin is
[59:11] open source like there's no secret to
[59:13] bitcoin it's it's it's a social layer
[59:16] that's uh that is valuable not not the
[59:19] code itself the code itself is you can
[59:21] copy it and write your own name on top
[59:24] of it um but you raise an interest point
[59:26] and and that's also I think the the
[59:28] biggest use case I see for for altcoins
[59:31] it's a test Network for for Bitcoin it's
[59:34] it's where we can see what else we can
[59:38] do with blockchains and if it actually
[59:40] has value and it's it's so valuable that
[59:43] it's
[59:44] decentralized then we can actually put
[59:46] it on bitcoin that's what I meant before
[59:48] of like okay what is the necessity of of
[59:51] of altcoins and where I wanted to get
[59:53] that because either you decentralize it
[59:57] or you don't so like like of course
[59:59] there's like you can make an argument
[60:01] there's like a spectrum of dis onization
[60:04] and there's no fully decentralized we
[60:08] also know Bitcoin has its problems with
[60:10] mining pools and stuff like that so you
[60:11] can also attack the decentralized nature
[60:14] of Bitcoin but it's the most
[60:16] decentralized there is uh and it's it it
[60:20] crossed some sort of bar uh where uh
[60:24] everything else is not really
[60:27] decentralized it's it's like maybe more
[60:30] decentralized than a database but it's
[60:32] not decentralized enough that you put
[60:35] your life savings in it and if it's not
[60:37] decentralized enough for doing that how
[60:39] decentralized is it really like would
[60:42] you trust um uh all your money uh and
[60:47] let's say look you look at you're a 50
[60:49] year old man with with fre kids uh and a
[60:52] wife and you have to take care of them
[60:54] would you trust uh the Solana or
[60:57] ethereum blockchain with all your life
[60:59] savings I would get bet no and that and
[61:02] and you you can trust that with Bitcoin
[61:05] uh so you you don't really have the
[61:07] decentralization but if there's value
[61:09] like from a technical perspective we can
[61:12] either use that in Bitcoin uh or if it's
[61:16] not valuable then let's let's it will
[61:19] die out anyways with the free market so
[61:21] that my short rent about altcoins where
[61:24] I'm like I I I do see them as valuable
[61:28] in a sense of them being a test Network
[61:32] for Bitcoin uh and people can play
[61:35] around with them and I also see that
[61:38] people try to make more Bitcoin with
[61:41] altcoins um if it works for you like
[61:45] congratulations uh I would never
[61:47] recommend that to anyone um but uh for
[61:52] most people it doesn't work sorry sorry
[61:54] for my rant oh you're good I mean most
[61:58] people who go from like who use altcoin
[62:01] like altcoin season to make money do two
[62:04] things they either go straight into Fiat
[62:06] or they go back into Bitcoin but to
[62:09] trade your Bitcoin to then go into alts
[62:12] back to bitcoin you're actually probably
[62:14] losing a lot more Bitcoin doing so um
[62:18] and plus you know you also have to pay
[62:20] the capital gains on that right you're
[62:21] better off in something that has a store
[62:23] of value over time
[62:26] um
[62:27] I even going back to salana I don't know
[62:30] anyone who's 100% in salana right like
[62:32] you can spend Years to you know studying
[62:36] salana but it's not the same thing as
[62:38] like you're spending years studying
[62:40] Bitcoin right like there's so many more
[62:42] people that hold Bitcoin that like you
[62:45] would have to get that same amount of
[62:46] people to be able to hold a different
[62:48] currency no matter what it is to use it
[62:50] in society right that's why US dollar is
[62:52] so valuable right because it's a Global
[62:54] Currency and the reason why we're moving
[62:56] into Bitcoin right is because more
[62:59] people are holding Bitcoin on a global
[63:01] scale just say yeah yeah I I I I don't
[63:04] get anyone that holds any
[63:06] altcoins but I I do respect it but you
[63:09] said like you you're even like
[63:10] completely out now of altcoins as a as I
[63:13] understood you that's I think that's a a
[63:16] clever move being not into altcoins and
[63:18] being uh Focus focused on bitcoin I but
[63:23] I the one thing that I'm curious about
[63:25] how
[63:26] how the capital markets um will will
[63:29] develop because the the capital markets
[63:31] could really benefit from being more
[63:33] open and more transparent um even more
[63:37] than than now uh but yeah I I I don't
[63:41] think that's a valid reason to invest
[63:43] now in in a in a in altcoin like that's
[63:46] that doesn't seem interest like at least
[63:49] for me not but maybe I'm maybe I'm the
[63:52] Boomer defending gold and not seeing
[63:54] Bitcoin here
[63:56] no that's I I mean I don't consider
[63:58] myself a Bitcoin Maxi um right I'm fully
[64:02] on the Bitcoin side but I don't consider
[64:04] myself a Bitcoin Maxi because people
[64:05] will see altcoins as whatever they want
[64:08] for themselves and most of that is
[64:10] really just like how can I make a little
[64:12] bit more of a stack um or on the other
[64:16] end is am I actually a user of this
[64:18] blockchain and am I actually going to
[64:20] use it in my day-to-day that could be
[64:22] the that could be the case for some
[64:23] people right like actually using that
[64:26] token in their day-to-day or whatever
[64:28] industry they're in or the opposite
[64:31] which is like oh this token or this
[64:34] crypto such as Bitcoin is instead of it
[64:37] being like something I use for work it's
[64:39] something that I gain as a monetary
[64:42] thing instead yeah think you can think
[64:45] of crypto almost like stocks right it's
[64:47] like you're trading stocks for Value
[64:51] right you're trading crypto for Value
[64:53] some cryptos have utility with right
[64:56] like trading the token for whatever you
[64:58] trade it for Value information um you
[65:01] know being able to use the service but
[65:03] stocks on the other hand is holding that
[65:05] value I still think like and you can't
[65:07] you know you use the company without you
[65:11] know using the stock at the company
[65:13] crypto is different because you use the
[65:14] token in the company um as you're using
[65:18] it like as you're using the company yeah
[65:21] that that's the thing that I'm curious
[65:23] about uh let's say there's like uh and
[65:26] uh let's say J gbd like I'm using J gbd
[65:29] uh every single day it's it's a great
[65:31] service I look I have to look at the
[65:33] Croc free apparently it's really good
[65:35] maybe I'm ditching jbd for Croc free but
[65:38] uh let's see because right now it works
[65:41] really good if if I'm using it um uh
[65:45] that much and I'm so convinced of it I
[65:48] might as well buy some some small stock
[65:50] in chat gbd right now if I want to do
[65:53] that I have to buy Microsoft stock
[65:56] that's I think that's probably the
[65:58] closest thing to buying uh jgb right now
[66:02] um but I I would love to have the
[66:05] possibility um to just like own a small
[66:08] bit of um JB but that has to be super
[66:13] tight like I have to know that I
[66:15] actually own this thing um and that uh
[66:19] that's a that's that's a problem then if
[66:21] it's not fully decentralized of like how
[66:24] do I know that they won't screw me over
[66:27] uh and and
[66:29] traditionally uh how we know that is
[66:32] with a law system like if if they screw
[66:34] me over um uh the they like stocks
[66:39] nowadays are so regulated that they
[66:41] won't screw screw you over they are on
[66:44] such a high scrutiny under the S and
[66:46] stuff like that maybe even like too much
[66:48] sometimes um so that's that's how I know
[66:52] it like because there is a law system
[66:54] there there there someone that I can go
[66:57] to and I have trust and faith in for
[67:01] example American law system that even if
[67:04] uh I if I buy Microsoft stock now that
[67:08] uh I I will have that and Microsoft not
[67:10] says like oh he doesn't have stocks like
[67:12] we we do don't have it on our records um
[67:16] so we need that uh and then open
[67:19] permissionless like an open
[67:21] permissionless stock market that that
[67:23] would be one heck of a thing but just to
[67:26] be clear I don't see that at all in
[67:28] crypto currently I I see some I see some
[67:31] projects that that try to do that um but
[67:34] I don't I don't like it it has to be
[67:37] integrated with security like it it has
[67:39] to be um something where you can
[67:43] actually unless unless big companies
[67:47] like Amazon do it I I don't see it as
[67:49] leged on there but yeah maybe I'm not a
[67:52] boomer defending gold again but I I
[67:55] I I just I just didn't see any I did see
[67:59] value and I had I think about I try to
[68:02] think about that video game that I was
[68:04] involved in there was some video game
[68:07] that uh that had uh tokens and it was
[68:10] was I think it was built on on ethereum
[68:12] and you when you play you get ethereum
[68:14] stuff like that uh it was for a very
[68:16] long time in in in beta phase and in
[68:19] development as they usually are those
[68:21] those projects um and back then I saw
[68:24] really a value of like oh like I can I
[68:26] can own part of the game and if the the
[68:28] game is valuable then I then I uh uh
[68:33] then I gain from it and if it's not then
[68:35] not it kind of is a stock market before
[68:39] the stock market like you you you you
[68:42] can invest even earlier as an early
[68:44] investor that's usually restricted but I
[68:47] don't know if that's uh how we how we
[68:51] could build that uh that I I don't see
[68:53] that currently in the crypto industry
[68:55] that actually gives me some ideas
[68:57] because you know when you have a company
[68:59] right
[69:01] especially um the thing about cryptos is
[69:03] you're you're offering you know a
[69:07] portion of your company um to raised
[69:10] funds right and the difference with
[69:13] stock is that at least but when you
[69:16] issue when stocks go on the stock market
[69:19] there was there has been some
[69:22] underlying um part of the company that
[69:25] has shown that it can do what it's doing
[69:28] and it has
[69:29] value right so it's now investing in
[69:33] from it sounds like it's like you want
[69:34] to invest in a company before or like a
[69:38] product of a company before it hits the
[69:42] market um and in doing so it actually
[69:45] kind of sounds like Angel Investing or
[69:47] investing in like private companies but
[69:49] that comes with like a lot of networking
[69:52] and also being um you have to have like
[69:56] it's not a certificate but it's kind of
[69:58] like you have to be an accredited
[69:59] investor you have to have a certain
[70:00] amount of money under your belt right
[70:02] rather than being like Oh I have like a,
[70:05] dollar right that I can stick into this
[70:07] company and just have like a small
[70:09] portion of it right to help fund this
[70:12] but I think the thing with J chat gbt
[70:14] chat gbt though with Microsoft is
[70:17] Microsoft has so much money that they
[70:20] know that the value of adding chat gbt
[70:23] is exponential and they wouldn't I
[70:25] wouldn't would see them wanting to give
[70:26] up any of that um like any percentage of
[70:29] that but for small companies I could see
[70:31] that being like hey I'm gonna I want to
[70:34] raise funds and here's like here's like
[70:37] a percent of the company and I can raise
[70:42] funds from that and in doing that I give
[70:45] you a portion of the like not part of
[70:48] that 1% for whatever funds you want to
[70:50] give me in hopes that I will give you a
[70:53] return or can give you a return
[70:57] afterwards I think it's just investing
[71:00] before something has like shown up or
[71:03] like shown out in the market um which
[71:07] happens now but more um in like a
[71:10] traditional Finance say per se not a
[71:13] decentralized way and on a like a larger
[71:16] scale yeah there
[71:18] also sorry oh goad H there's also those
[71:23] um programs where you give early
[71:26] employees stake at the company uh of
[71:29] like oh like okay you get part of your
[71:31] salary in in in just euros and and part
[71:34] of your salary depending on how long you
[71:37] stick with the company you actually get
[71:38] paid out in in in shares uh I was
[71:41] actually getting involved in a startup
[71:43] uh I think like four years ago I didn't
[71:48] did not end up actually working for them
[71:50] only a very short time uh and and those
[71:55] if if I would have um if I would have uh
[71:58] been with them and and started that
[72:00] whole thing I would have been probably
[72:02] the one of the first or second employees
[72:04] there uh and they offered like employee
[72:08] share options something like that uh so
[72:11] there are Concepts around that uh a
[72:14] legal framework around that um and
[72:16] that's super
[72:18] interesting um but it opens up the door
[72:22] to a lot of
[72:24] scams because then all of the sudden
[72:26] people come up and make a website a nice
[72:30] narrative buy two three influencers and
[72:33] make up a project and rock pull a lot of
[72:35] small retail investors that hope for big
[72:38] money and I don't know how we get the
[72:43] openness of the market without the
[72:47] scams uh if because we have carefully
[72:50] built now this whole stock thing and
[72:53] this whole security exchange thing
[72:55] um and we can debate if it's good or not
[72:58] it probably has some good and bads um
[73:02] but the the decision is like do we want
[73:05] the wild west of like everyone can raise
[73:08] money um uh probably we shouldn't want
[73:12] that but how do we do that and for that
[73:16] is it necessary that that we put it on
[73:19] on blockchain tokens is is then the next
[73:21] question of like maybe there's even
[73:22] better technology of of of building
[73:25] those those uh stock markets transparent
[73:28] stock markets um but yeah like it's an
[73:32] it's an interesting discussion where
[73:34] it's just something that I don't have an
[73:35] opinion on like I either either it it
[73:38] stays in the legal system that we are
[73:40] now in or it gets completely free both
[73:43] as advantages disadvantages uh in in
[73:45] either way I don't know like if if we
[73:48] get there will be interesting to to see
[73:51] but we have been very Advanced already
[73:52] with the time um is anything you you
[73:55] want to add
[73:56] today
[73:58] um I would like to bring I was going to
[74:00] bring up crowdfunding actually but
[74:03] crowdfunding is the ability to you know
[74:05] procure fun funds or get funds from
[74:07] people without those people giving up or
[74:10] earning or having any stake in the
[74:12] company itself think even with crypto
[74:14] tokens right you own a very very small
[74:18] percentage of the company because that's
[74:20] that's the company's value is based off
[74:23] of the valuation of that token
[74:25] in the market um yeah that's that's the
[74:28] the crowdfunding is um very interesting
[74:32] for me like oh like you you fund a
[74:34] project that hopefully makes money in
[74:36] the in in the future and you don't get
[74:38] any shares from that it's like why would
[74:41] you do that but a lot of people do it
[74:43] and and I mean um if it's a novel cause
[74:46] of like something political almost like
[74:49] a charity thing like it it's it's a
[74:51] weird thing between angel investor and
[74:53] charity I feel like crowdfunding it's
[74:55] it's um I don't know I I I I still don't
[74:58] really know like what what to do with
[75:00] crowdfunding like if it's donation wise
[75:03] a charity like I I I do enjoy that yeah
[75:06] there's definitely I I don't think it's
[75:08] a charity thing but it is definitely a
[75:11] way for people to be able to get funding
[75:15] from um other people even if it's small
[75:17] amounts like geyser dot fund is great
[75:20] because you can fund people's projects
[75:22] whether they're art projects or actual
[75:23] startups um um for very small amounts of
[75:27] STS right um or if you want to send a
[75:30] lot
[75:30] more but the difference between um doing
[75:35] something like that versus you know
[75:36] actually like B paying into the company
[75:39] or like buying into the company is the
[75:42] like the stake like I have no stake um
[75:46] in a crowdfunding company I'm just
[75:47] giving my dollars and hopes that this
[75:49] company will actually like be able to do
[75:51] what it says it's going to do um and
[75:54] then invest in is more like investing
[75:58] for like a small stake is like I'm going
[76:00] to give you some money but I also want
[76:01] you to actually go a lot further because
[76:03] I have not just a stake of money but I
[76:07] also have like an interest in making
[76:08] sure that the equity and the value of
[76:11] that company actually continues to be
[76:14] driven that's super interesting yeah GAA
[76:16] is an interesting one I had also the the
[76:19] the um I think one or two people from
[76:22] there already on uh because the the they
[76:25] have they have all types of projects on
[76:28] there and they are like all the content
[76:29] creators are on there like books are in
[76:32] there meetups on there uh courses on
[76:35] there circular economies Collectibles
[76:38] movies art it it's it's kind of
[76:40] fascinating the whole wa wait I thought
[76:43] I shared it but I actually just see it
[76:45] myself um um for people that don't know
[76:48] guysa I have a interview with them
[76:50] actually on um and and it's an it's an
[76:53] interesting one and and I I I do like
[76:56] the the the ways of like using Bitcoin
[76:59] to do something like that uh having
[77:02] having the opportunities to fund um some
[77:06] of those project where it does not make
[77:10] sense to issue a token underneath it um
[77:14] I don't know like a mid the age Academy
[77:16] with with duja Madusa I know him he was
[77:18] already in the podcast uh that's a
[77:21] that's a great cause of like uh
[77:23] supporting that
[77:25] um I don't know if I would call it
[77:27] charity but it's it's like you you want
[77:30] to give that money to really help them
[77:34] out and and they have raised like $6,000
[77:37] uh dollars like 18 million SS that's
[77:40] that's a that's a good amount of of
[77:42] money um uh depending on what you want
[77:45] to do with that money uh but uh it's a
[77:48] it's a good thing I feel like but uh
[77:50] yeah I I do like I do like that
[77:55] the I like the concept because it's
[77:57] different than like issuing tokens and
[77:59] you also get to help people out um also
[78:02] get to see really cool projects it's
[78:04] it's kind of like a Fiat version of
[78:06] Kickstarter but not just for random
[78:09] things um or there's also another
[78:12] crowdfunding site but it's not coming to
[78:14] mind the one that's used more often in
[78:17] the United States but people usually
[78:20] would uh use that site for like earning
[78:23] uh getting money for paying for like
[78:25] treat like Health treatments and stuff
[78:28] like that yeah there there are a lot of
[78:31] like kickstar is also one GoFundMe is
[78:33] probably the one that's the one I was
[78:35] talking about yeah yeah that that's
[78:37] that's also a good one yeah but yeah
[78:39] like uh things like that is cool but you
[78:42] don't get stake in the company and
[78:44] probably would be way too complicated to
[78:46] to to to set this up legally really cool
[78:49] um uh one question that I asked each and
[78:51] every one of my guests is what can we
[78:53] learn from you besides
[78:55] Bitcoin for sure um I'm actually in the
[79:00] sustainability you know the recycling
[79:01] for Bitcoin idea I had mentioned earlier
[79:03] is actually just a uh recycling idea now
[79:07] um slowly starting to kind of Drive the
[79:10] circularity of Beverage containers in
[79:12] every Community um to you know bring to
[79:16] not only one bring about a cleaner space
[79:19] but then to also to get a lot of value
[79:21] from scrap metals and Plastics that are
[79:24] polluting our Earth and putting it more
[79:26] in a in a chain where people can earn
[79:30] value across it so for me my two biggest
[79:32] things is how can I drive Bitcoin
[79:35] adoption in today's society and then
[79:37] secondly is like how can I make sure
[79:39] that the future that we're leaving in
[79:41] the future actually is clean enough so
[79:44] that people who are in Bitcoin can
[79:45] actually spend their Bitcoin later on
[79:48] right um so for for me that's my two
[79:50] things that that that would have been a
[79:53] a whole another podcast right there
[79:55] because H it's it's it's so interesting
[79:58] how um the the the Green community is
[80:03] really going after Bitcoin sometimes and
[80:05] I'm like don't don't you see that
[80:07] Bitcoin is actually really good like for
[80:09] for all the problems that you describe
[80:11] and I have friends that that are really
[80:14] working on like making the the world
[80:16] clean and like like great that you work
[80:18] on but but why don't you get Bitcoin so
[80:22] I I that we could include another hour
[80:25] of those discussions but maybe quickly
[80:28] of like um if you if you have still time
[80:32] like because I think we are yeah okay um
[80:35] um how do you approach that if if if you
[80:39] because there are a lot of um green
[80:42] initiative and some of them I feel like
[80:45] get corrupted by um just left ideas of
[80:49] like communism and stuff like that uh
[80:51] and for some reason also most most of
[80:54] them are really against Bitcoin first
[80:57] like why do you think where this coming
[80:59] from this like anti- Bitcoin uh movement
[81:02] with in the Green community uh and then
[81:05] secondly what what are you saying to
[81:07] those those people you probably
[81:09] encounter a lot of them if you're in
[81:10] both
[81:11] communities yeah so I think a lot a lot
[81:14] of it is the lack of Education right we
[81:16] have a lot of Articles out there that
[81:18] talk about how Bitcoin you know takes up
[81:21] a lot of energy but I also think we lack
[81:23] a lot of information out there that
[81:26] people don't recognize is like the Fiat
[81:28] industry takes up a lot of energy um the
[81:31] centralized areas take up like servers
[81:34] take up a lot of energy like if you
[81:37] piece out what in our current system
[81:39] takes up a lot of energy you will
[81:41] recognize Bitcoin in hindsight actually
[81:44] does not take up as much right I I'm I
[81:47] can't give you numbers on that but look
[81:49] at all of the banks that have
[81:52] centralized servers around world right
[81:56] few of them blow up those people are out
[81:58] of their money right blow up a few
[82:01] servers on the Bitcoin side it's still
[82:03] functioning um so when I talk to people
[82:06] in the sustainability space about
[82:07] Bitcoin and they bring up like the
[82:09] energy thing or like how they could
[82:11] utilize blockchain in like the
[82:13] sustainability side you know most people
[82:16] talk about it from like the supply chain
[82:17] side for me it's more of how do I get
[82:20] Bitcoin in everyone's pocket so that
[82:22] they can use it in their day-to-day
[82:25] um and then transitioning from like you
[82:27] know both the Fiat and the Bitcoin side
[82:30] to more of like a Bitcoin Centric World
[82:33] um I think the more Bitcoin is in
[82:35] people's pockets the less Fiat that's
[82:36] being used the less energy that's being
[82:38] used the less you know transportation of
[82:41] money across seaways Airways all these
[82:43] different things um so I really when I
[82:46] talk to people on the sustainability
[82:47] side really just gauge their questions
[82:49] and answer from there a lot of what I
[82:51] teach is all conversational so when
[82:53] people come me um about Bitcoin
[82:55] education or just like you know
[82:57] clarifying whatever confusions or
[82:59] questions they have it's all
[83:00] conversational because I'm I'm teaching
[83:02] you from your level of understanding
[83:05] right and everyone's level of
[83:07] understanding is all based off of their
[83:09] perspectives and what they have learned
[83:11] from before right and that's the same
[83:13] thing with sustainability is you know
[83:15] some people see sustainability as one of
[83:16] those things that it's
[83:18] like we don't need this right like the
[83:20] world's not going to go to global
[83:22] warming is not a thing and then you have
[83:23] the other side people are educated where
[83:25] they have the numbers it's the same
[83:27] thing with Bitcoin it's it's all
[83:29] educational based and I just don't think
[83:32] a lot of people have that in the
[83:33] sustainability side but they're not
[83:35] against it you know I I haven't met
[83:37] anyone who was fully against Bitcoin on
[83:39] the sustainability side especially if
[83:42] you give them enough information or you
[83:45] um kind of Point them in the right
[83:47] direction I have met
[83:51] someone uh but um maybe I'm not uh
[83:55] not not good enough in educating them
[83:58] that that might be on me uh but yeah
[84:00] like it's it's it's also interesting how
[84:04] uh Bitcoin seems to be a little bit more
[84:06] popular on the right side of the
[84:08] political aisle there are democrates
[84:10] there are people on the left side they
[84:13] even
[84:14] like there are really Communists that
[84:17] that really are in Bitcoin I've I've met
[84:19] them uh so there there's like everyone
[84:22] is in the Bitcoin but it seems to lean a
[84:24] little bit towards the the right aisle
[84:27] but maybe that's also just perspective
[84:29] because Donald Trump is uh is doing that
[84:32] and stuff like that but uh it seems like
[84:35] more conservative people are having
[84:38] Bitcoin which makes sense because
[84:40] Bitcoin is conserving Financial energy
[84:42] in the best way maybe that's where the
[84:44] idea comes from um but it's uh it's it's
[84:48] 7 Day interesting how political it got
[84:51] and also with um the the green uh topics
[84:55] it it sometimes has it gets less and
[84:58] less I feel like for some reason since
[85:01] since black rug is in the game uh the
[85:04] the the anti Bitcoin climate change
[85:08] things are getting less and less and and
[85:10] people are actually adop um adopting it
[85:13] and people are actually like Mo most
[85:15] people that are still saying like oh
[85:18] Bitcoin is bad for environment they have
[85:22] this opinion already since years
[85:25] that's what I usually uh uncover and I
[85:28] try to focus on like okay like okay a
[85:31] lot of people a lot of things are bad
[85:33] for an environment the best thing for
[85:34] the environment would be to get away
[85:37] with all the buildings get away with all
[85:38] the computers get away with all the
[85:40] humans uh and then the environment has
[85:42] all the space on Earth and that's the
[85:44] best thing for the environment but we
[85:46] don't want that I mean maybe there are
[85:48] some people that don't want that but I
[85:50] don't want that uh so uh how how can we
[85:54] better bance a a livable
[85:57] life but still use the planet in in a
[86:01] responsible way uh and and keeping
[86:04] things clean um uh and uh yeah that
[86:08] that's
[86:09] a it's it's always like in the Middle
[86:12] where you um discuss a lot and where you
[86:16] have to get get between the lines and
[86:18] not just like be on on one extreme end
[86:20] of of things it it gets you you have to
[86:23] explain a lot and then it gets
[86:25] unpopular yeah and but I also think that
[86:27] also comes with a lot of examples of
[86:29] things you know like Bitcoin mining is
[86:30] one thing right like Bitcoin mining is
[86:32] very energy intensive right also
[86:35] requires a lot of computer like
[86:37] computers like Hardware physically right
[86:41] one thing that a lot of people don't
[86:42] recognize though is that you can
[86:43] actually set up mining to use a lot of
[86:46] wasted energy already right you have the
[86:49] bath houses in New York City you have
[86:52] the um burn burning of extra gas or oil
[86:57] um in like Texas so um using excess are
[87:01] off um off our electric um electricity
[87:05] that's already produced but not being
[87:07] used anywhere so I think there's a lot
[87:09] of different components that people
[87:11] aren't aware about and it's just based
[87:14] off of Education um and you know like I
[87:19] said earlier you cannot force people to
[87:21] change their mind you you can only guide
[87:23] them right like you uh I I'm not going
[87:26] to sit here and try to have an argument
[87:28] with people about Bitcoin like I I will
[87:30] just let you know and if I need to I
[87:32] will happily get up and walk away
[87:34] because I'm not in a place of convincing
[87:36] and no one should ever be in a place of
[87:38] convincing someone about Bitcoin people
[87:40] get to bitcoin when they get to bitcoin
[87:42] I think people will eventually always
[87:43] get to bitcoin even if it takes them 101
[87:46] 15 years um but it really is they have
[87:49] to unlearn a lot of things that they've
[87:51] already learned and a lot of things that
[87:53] are already
[87:54] like set in stone so because when you
[87:58] look at when you look at Bitcoin you're
[87:59] looking at an industry that's been
[88:00] around for 16 years that is growing
[88:04] right that is still making its way that
[88:06] is still creating things that people are
[88:09] moving into right like you have people
[88:11] who are very technical who know how to
[88:13] use lightning how to set up these
[88:15] different wallets how to save different
[88:17] things and then you have the other end
[88:18] with people who would rather just use
[88:20] the product or the service without
[88:22] having to go through the whole whole
[88:24] technical aspects so it it really is
[88:27] just like a learning curb and then also
[88:28] not having to force people um into that
[88:30] learning if people are really stuck on
[88:32] the mindset of Bitcoin super energy
[88:35] intensive and you send them a bunch of
[88:36] Articles like kind of like supplementing
[88:39] otherwise that's that's it they you can
[88:42] give them only as much information as
[88:44] they're willing to receive it's again
[88:46] like hitting that brick wall it's like
[88:47] they're not going to step over to
[88:49] continue if they're being met with the
[88:51] same
[88:52] um rest restrictions in their own life
[88:55] that they're not going like getting over
[88:58] absolutely yeah it's it's also you push
[89:02] people away like if if if they are not
[89:05] ready to get orange pilled they will get
[89:09] further pushed away from Bitcoin with
[89:11] you trying to explain it to them they
[89:13] have to be ready they have to um be
[89:16] open-minded there's some people that are
[89:18] always ready for to learning new things
[89:20] um uh but uh they also have to be ready
[89:24] in some sense like no nobody is always
[89:27] ready for Bitcoin um uh and and some are
[89:31] more ready and some are less ready so uh
[89:34] you have to come to them at the right
[89:36] time with the right messages uh and uh
[89:39] all that takes time and energy and uh
[89:43] also something that I'm trying to push
[89:44] is like don't hate on people that don't
[89:47] get Bitcoin they also human beings uh
[89:50] they they also deserve to have a chance
[89:52] of figuring that whole thing out uh as
[89:55] we all did like I called Bitcoin a scam
[89:59] for three years straight uh and uh many
[90:02] others did too and so I'm glad the
[90:05] Bitcoin Community accepted me uh and uh
[90:10] we we should not hate on on people just
[90:11] because they don't get Bitcoin um uh and
[90:15] dropping every now and then some
[90:17] knowledge around Bitcoin to to make them
[90:20] understand is the better way of like
[90:22] blending the seed of like they they will
[90:24] get there like everyone will get there
[90:27] eventually that that's that's the whole
[90:29] thing um we have one more thing uh in in
[90:32] the end of the podcast the end routine
[90:34] where the previous guest is asking a
[90:36] question for the next guest without
[90:37] knowing who the next guest actually is
[90:39] and uh your question from the previous
[90:41] guest is why will Bitcoin never change
[90:44] proof of work to proof of stake oh oh
[90:47] that's a good one I like that question
[90:50] okay so proof of stake actually is
[90:52] people who have a set amount of Bitcoin
[90:55] right or like a set amount of tokens
[90:57] ahead of time so those are early
[90:58] adopters and stuff I actually don't
[91:01] believe we would ever move to a proof of
[91:03] stake because a lot of the early
[91:05] adopters um I'd like to
[91:08] say
[91:10] uh don't really want to wouldn't want to
[91:12] like move their tokens or like their
[91:15] coins into something that's then held
[91:17] for like five years yeah you're better
[91:19] off like don't get me wrong if you had
[91:22] if if we move if Bitcoin did move to
[91:24] proof of stake right and you had to like
[91:27] like ethereum where you stake 32 eth you
[91:29] stake 32 Bitcoin for your for your node
[91:33] right and then you have to keep it
[91:35] locked in for five years I would rather
[91:37] do that than have 32 eat Stak for five
[91:41] years right but the reason why we
[91:43] wouldn't move to a proof of stake from a
[91:45] proof of work is early adopters there's
[91:47] so many people on the network you know
[91:50] Bitcoin is decentralized the whole
[91:52] purpose of it is that anyone can run a
[91:54] node right you you shouldn't have to
[91:57] have a large stack to be able to
[91:59] contribute or you know send a private
[92:01] transaction to the blockchain um I I
[92:05] think that's those are some of the
[92:07] reasons why we would never move to a
[92:08] proof of stake um and why proof of work
[92:11] works so well for Bitcoin um also um
[92:15] bitcoin's for everyone why restrict it
[92:17] to you know people who have that money
[92:19] you don't even have to be an early
[92:21] adopter but if you could buy 32 Bitcoin
[92:24] worth or whatever like that staking
[92:26] amount would be right like you would put
[92:29] yourself ahead of the curve um because
[92:33] you have that monetary ability right at
[92:36] this point proof of work allows anyone
[92:38] no matter when you come into Bitcoin
[92:40] even 20 years from now to be able to run
[92:44] a node if you so choose right I think
[92:48] that sets the Bitcoin proof uh work away
[92:51] from like potentially a proof of stake
[92:54] and the philosophical aspect is is just
[92:56] like like do you really want to have a
[92:58] money that is um controlled by then a
[93:02] group of people because that's what I
[93:05] hear also sometimes from Norman like oh
[93:07] but all all those ogs like what if they
[93:10] dump their coins or what they if they do
[93:11] something like that yeah like they can
[93:13] do that um people sell and buy gold all
[93:16] the time and gold is still around so
[93:19] it's like it's okay it's a free market
[93:22] but if they control Network and it's
[93:24] proof of stake and then it's a stock
[93:27] again then it has no value in in in in
[93:29] my opinion it it can have value but it's
[93:32] then the same thing as a stock and it's
[93:34] not money anymore uh so yeah that's
[93:37] that's a that's a good point that that
[93:38] you brought up yeah really cool thank
[93:40] you so much Ashen for for being on my my
[93:42] podcast before I let you go where can
