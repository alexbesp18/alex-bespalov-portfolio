[00:00] the price of Bitcoin is going to go up
[00:01] to $110 million coin the difference
[00:03] between 2% inflation or 2% deflection
[00:06] per year and 0% deflection or 0%
[00:10] inflation is the difference between an
[00:12] average life expectancy of 70 and
[00:15] immortality what's the difference
[00:16] between perfect money and imperfect
[00:18] money perfect money is economic
[00:20] immortality imperfect money is we all
[00:22] have a short brutal life the Chinese
[00:25] will Embrace Bitcoin name a company
[00:27] that's still in existence from a 100
[00:30] years ago off the top of your head where
[00:32] the stock is worth more today in real
[00:34] terms than it was then what if I told
[00:36] you I could make your company live
[00:37] forever when you have a need to know
[00:40] when you have a crisis if your country
[00:42] is in crisis if your company is in
[00:44] crisis if your family is in crisis when
[00:46] the bank freezes and fails and the
[00:49] currency crashes and you have a business
[00:51] or you or you have a life and you're in
[00:53] that culture you have a need to know
[00:55] your eyes are open now you adopt Bitcoin
[00:58] Trump has discovered coin Trump has a
[01:01] need to know Mike I don't remember when
[01:02] did we first meet and you know and
[01:04] you'll say well you know the first time
[01:05] we met you kicked me out and told me I
[01:07] was a and they're like I don't
[01:09] remember that at all did I do that I'm
[01:10] sorry I did that the difference between
[01:12] me Swinging a baseball bat at your head
[01:15] while you're looking that way versus me
[01:17] doing this with a baseball bat saying
[01:20] you should duck I'm about to swing it
[01:22] right one of them is interesting maybe
[01:24] it's entertaining and the other is
[01:27] brutal fire is scary people run from the
[01:29] fire don't wave the fire in your
[01:32] sister's face when Apple encounters
[01:34] Bitcoin I think they may look at it and
[01:36] think wait a minute uh Bitcoin multi-
[01:38] signature Cloud what if we actually make
[01:41] the Apple watch a signing device and
[01:45] combine it with the iPhone and combine
[01:46] it with the third Sony device on a
[01:49] laptop and then we do something with the
[01:51] cloud maybe the future biggest bank in
[01:54] the world is Apple computer and Apple's
[01:55] going to give us easy to use safe
[01:58] multisig that's 6 years roles can figure
[02:00] out how's Bitcoin going to scale you're
[02:02] going to see a growth in layer 2os a
[02:05] growth in layer 3es you're going to see
[02:07] the transactions on layer one get bigger
[02:10] the average transaction size is going to
[02:12] go to 2,000 then 20,000 then 200,000 and
[02:17] 2 million and 20 million do you want the
[02:19] billion people in China to be rich and
[02:21] do you want to be rich while the Chinese
[02:24] government still has a bunch of laws
[02:26] that you may or may not agree with or do
[02:28] you want the people in China to be poor
[02:30] and you to be poor while the Chinese
[02:31] government has a set of laws that you
[02:33] don't agree with do you think that
[02:35] you're so great you're Superman that you
[02:37] can just go and topple the entire
[02:38] government by barking on Twitter how did
[02:41] Bitcoin change
[02:43] [Music]
[02:46] you hi Michael how you doing uh thank
[02:49] you for being on my podcast awesome
[02:51] happy to be here it's actually my second
[02:53] in-person podcast ever I have done 151
[02:57] podcast episodes and you're my second
[03:00] one in person I I love that a lot
[03:02] they're a lot better in real life
[03:03] definitely a lot better and I had
[03:06] totally different uh questions plan and
[03:08] I just love the presentation you gave at
[03:11] Bitcoin prag right now um we now at the
[03:13] Bitcoin prag event uh and I wanted to
[03:16] just start up with the income uh that
[03:20] you gave the entry in the presentation
[03:22] you gave about Bitcoin is the
[03:23] singularity where science collides with
[03:26] economics and I needed to think about
[03:28] that few times before I like oh maybe I
[03:33] grasp what it is um can we go deeper on
[03:36] that like what does this mean uh on many
[03:40] levels what do you mean with
[03:43] that the scientific method the
[03:46] application of of um
[03:50] mathematics uh disciplined logic
[03:56] experimentation engineering
[04:00] um trial and
[04:01] error um if we think about the
[04:04] scientific method applied to
[04:07] astronomy right the the the capern
[04:09] Revolution and the breakthroughs in
[04:12] astronomy they came because of a new
[04:14] instrument right advances and Optics
[04:17] allowed us to create a
[04:18] telescope and before the telescope
[04:22] before that technology if you will for
[04:24] 100,000 years human beings looked up in
[04:27] the sky and they imagined they erod what
[04:30] was going on and then they filled in the
[04:32] blanks with with their uh Superstition
[04:36] and their creativity and they had their
[04:38] fears and hopes and dreams and
[04:41] religion mixed in with with observation
[04:45] and they somehow got around to
[04:47] concluding that the Universe revolved
[04:50] around the earth and if anybody
[04:52] suggested the universe did not revolve
[04:54] around the earth they were burned or
[04:57] cancelled or ignored
[05:00] and that's a horrific you know wrong
[05:03] Theory and it causes you to make lots of
[05:06] mistakes mistakes in
[05:08] navigation you know uh maybe you'll
[05:11] never be able to master Concepts that
[05:13] would be critical to advancing the
[05:16] civilization and the Scientific
[05:18] Revolution applied to astronomy started
[05:20] with the technology when that telescope
[05:23] was created we could see the moons of
[05:25] Jupiter when we could see the moons of
[05:27] Jupiter we could start to calculate the
[05:29] impact back you know of the moons of
[05:31] Jupiter and we could correlate those
[05:34] those orbits to what we knew about
[05:36] Kepler's laws and Mathematics and
[05:39] somehow mathematics and
[05:41] physics um were impacted by uh
[05:45] engineering and technology and they
[05:48] resulted in a profound paradigm shift
[05:51] and that Paradigm Shift was maybe the
[05:54] universe doesn't revolve around the
[05:55] Earth in fact it seems quite obvious
[05:57] that that's not the way the universe
[05:59] work works and that catapulted us into
[06:02] an entirely new world and what follows
[06:05] next is Newtonian physics and after
[06:08] that the invention of of all of the
[06:12] mechanisms that made civilization
[06:14] possible
[06:17] um economics is pseudo science before
[06:20] Satoshi it's it's a quasi
[06:23] religious uh liberal arts and it's full
[06:26] of people's opinions and prejudices and
[06:28] biases
[06:30] and uh in the in the absence of an
[06:34] instrument and the instrument in this
[06:37] case is is perfect money or proper money
[06:40] if you don't have uh an instrument of
[06:44] proper money that doesn't have
[06:46] deflection then you can't posit a
[06:50] properly functioning economy and so all
[06:53] of the economists before Satoshi they
[06:57] were trying to work out the laws of
[06:58] Economics with shells and glass beads
[07:01] and pieces of paper and and uh and
[07:04] credit instruments and
[07:07] and those are all imperfect instruments
[07:10] right they're they're so imperfect you
[07:12] could never create a beautiful or
[07:14] perfect
[07:15] mechanism um and in the absence of the
[07:18] ability to manufacture the perfect
[07:21] mechanism you can't uh you can't move
[07:24] forward uh with uh scientific advance so
[07:29] when I say uh you know Bitcoin is
[07:32] singularity where science collides with
[07:37] economics I mean that we invented an
[07:40] instrument and the instrument was you
[07:42] know it's a combination of it was the
[07:44] math of
[07:46] cryptography it was the engineering and
[07:49] the manufacturing of
[07:51] semiconductors it was the computer
[07:54] science of the
[07:55] internet and when you put the internet
[07:58] and semi
[08:00] conductors and you put cryptography
[08:03] together with a few a few insights you
[08:06] can create this
[08:09] mechanism that we call Bitcoin and that
[08:13] and that becomes uh a mechanism uh to
[08:17] keep true
[08:20] track of money to keep to to measure
[08:24] true
[08:25] money when I say it like that it reminds
[08:28] me of of another great scientific
[08:31] revolution it was John Harrison's
[08:32] invention of the
[08:34] clock you know and and the perfect a
[08:37] maritime clock that could be used to
[08:41] calculate longitude on the ocean right
[08:44] before Harrison's clock there was no
[08:46] there's no way to calculate longitude
[08:48] before longitude we didn't know where we
[08:50] were on the on the sea it was profound
[08:52] breakthrough in the history of
[08:55] navigation it was made possible by
[08:57] Harrison's clock and Harrison's clock
[09:00] was a a mechanism so pre precise that
[09:03] you could keep track
[09:05] of universal time what we what we called
[09:08] Greenwich meantime now it's UT UT or
[09:12] universal time and um and once you had a
[09:17] mechanism precise enough to keep track
[09:19] of time in Greenwich at the Royal
[09:22] Observatory you could put it on a ship
[09:24] and you could you could compare it to a
[09:27] second clock which kept track of local
[09:29] time and subtracting the one from the
[09:32] other and multiplying by 15° per hour
[09:36] gave you a
[09:38] longitude so science advances with the
[09:42] arrival of a certain
[09:45] instrument until until you have that
[09:48] instrument for 100,000 years you can't
[09:51] calculate longitude right until you have
[09:54] the telescope for 100,000 years you
[09:56] can't see the mo of moons of Jupiter and
[09:58] you can't figure out cap laws really
[10:00] work you just can't you could pause it
[10:03] but you can't prove before cryptography
[10:06] and the internet and modern
[10:08] semiconductors you couldn't create a
[10:09] Bitcoin be can't if you can't create a
[10:11] Bitcoin you can't create perfect money
[10:13] if you don't have perfect money then you
[10:15] can't actually posit an economy where
[10:18] the money doesn't deflect where the
[10:20] money is true when the money becomes
[10:22] true the money is is the asset which is
[10:26] used to channel
[10:30] Capital through time and space right the
[10:33] essence of Economics is is the proper
[10:36] allocation of capital and
[10:40] so so Satoshi gave us a perfect money
[10:44] the perfect
[10:45] money made it possible to capture to
[10:51] store to channel to distribute Capital
[10:56] to program capital in an eon
[11:00] e and how profound is that well I mean
[11:03] the difference between 2% inflation or
[11:06] 2% deflection per year and 0% deflection
[11:11] or 0% inflation is the difference
[11:14] between an average life expectancy of 70
[11:18] and
[11:22] immortality right we figured out how not
[11:25] to die right it's pretty profound right
[11:29] when you think about it like that
[11:30] perfect what's the difference between
[11:31] perfect money and imperfect money
[11:34] perfect money is economic immortality
[11:36] imperfect money is we all we all have a
[11:39] short brutal
[11:41] life right terminated early there's a
[11:44] time a time when there's a 40% infant
[11:47] mortality rate between the ages of zero
[11:49] and five right your kids are going to
[11:50] die there's a time when the the
[11:52] likelihood that a woman giving birth
[11:54] dies in child birth was like
[11:57] 30% right you know before Mo before
[12:00] science crashed into
[12:03] medicine you know your children were
[12:05] more likely than not to die you know
[12:08] your wife was more likely than not to
[12:10] die in childbirth if you got her
[12:11] pregnant three times it was a death
[12:14] sentence and so you you think about life
[12:17] before science impinged on medicine
[12:20] pretty big deal you think about science
[12:22] impinging upon upon astronomy a pretty
[12:25] big deal science you know blasting into
[12:30] navigation right pretty big deal and now
[12:33] science colliding with
[12:37] economics pretty big deal yeah it's for
[12:39] me also fascinating I asked the question
[12:42] so many times in my podcast like how
[12:44] does Bitcoin change things like how does
[12:46] Bitcoin change society on a big uh level
[12:51] and you'll see also in the
[12:53] presentation you don't change Bitcoin
[12:56] Bitcoin changes you and you also say
[12:58] like Paradigm Shift uh that Bitcoin is
[13:01] and now also like the it changes the way
[13:03] we interact with with uh so many things
[13:07] how how different will be a world when
[13:10] we look out like 50 100 maybe even like
[13:13] a thousand years where we have this
[13:15] sound money on a digital realm uh all of
[13:18] the sudden this perfect money how
[13:20] different is world and how how what is
[13:23] possible on on on that
[13:27] scale I I think if you you look at uh
[13:31] economic
[13:32] creatures the the classic economic
[13:35] creature in modern society is the
[13:38] corporation the average life expectancy
[13:40] of a corporation is something like 10
[13:44] years you create a company and it lasts
[13:46] more than 10 years then you've lived
[13:48] longer than most the number of um of
[13:52] corporations that are more than a
[13:54] hundred years
[13:56] old right what percentage of people Liv
[13:59] to be more than 100 like
[14:01] 0.1% or 0.01% what percentage of
[14:04] Corporations love to be more than
[14:08] [Music]
[14:11] 100.1% well what if I told you I could
[14:15] make your company live
[14:18] forever right it's so how how
[14:22] profound we're talking about we're
[14:26] talking about uh eliminating corporate
[14:30] mortality right we're we're talking
[14:32] about stretching economic
[14:35] Vitality easily by a factor of 10 maybe
[14:38] by a factor of 100 Maybe by a factor of
[14:40] a million um so you know how will it
[14:44] change society well it won't change
[14:46] society uniformally the same everywhere
[14:49] it's like you know Gibson says uh the
[14:51] future's already with us but it's not
[14:53] evenly
[14:54] distributed right in the modern world
[14:56] today there are people in New York City
[14:58] that live in sky scrapers up 80 floors
[15:01] and there are people that live in Africa
[15:02] and mud
[15:04] Huts you know and you can find certain
[15:07] peoples that are still stuck in
[15:08] neolithic Stone Age cultures if you look
[15:11] hard enough and you can find people that
[15:13] if the electricity was turned off to
[15:15] their
[15:17] elevator they
[15:19] die right and so very very very profound
[15:22] difference I think um you got to look at
[15:26] um at Bitcoin is is pure digital Capital
[15:32] which means it's it's the technology to
[15:37] capitalize a a family capitalize an
[15:41] individual capitalize a
[15:43] corporation capitalize an institution a
[15:46] charity a nonprofit or uh a country or a
[15:51] city so or or a university right you
[15:54] know we we throw away the the word throw
[15:57] around the word capitalize is a
[15:59] colloquialism like oh you're going to
[16:01] capitalize on
[16:02] that okay but if you think and and
[16:05] that's because economics has been pseudo
[16:08] science and capital capital has been
[16:11] kind of a you know a liberal arts arts
[16:14] type word if you walked up to people on
[16:16] the street and said what do you think
[16:18] capital is and you asked them before
[16:21] Satoshi or before they said
[16:23] Bitcoin it's not clear what they would
[16:25] give you as an answer they would you
[16:27] know say something about coral Mark said
[16:30] it was bad or capitalist to do something
[16:32] with it but it it's such a such a fuzzy
[16:36] word but in the aftermath of Bitcoin
[16:40] capital is economic energy and I give
[16:42] you an asset to store economic energy
[16:45] and and uh now if I can store economic
[16:49] energy in a digital
[16:51] asset I can move the capital potentially
[16:54] at the speed of light at high frequency
[16:57] so I can move it through
[16:59] space right can you actually oscillate
[17:02] Capital at 10
[17:04] megahertz you can oscillate you know you
[17:07] can you can create a a 10 megahertz
[17:10] signal right 10 kertz signal you could
[17:12] probably hear right so at certain
[17:16] frequencies when you're when you're
[17:19] vibrating uh energy right you get a
[17:24] result capital's never been uh something
[17:28] we could work with we could program so
[17:31] Bitcoin allows you to program and
[17:33] channel Capital through time and space
[17:36] and uh in time it you know it means that
[17:39] we have the hope of addressing things
[17:42] like Global Payments for for 8 billion
[17:45] people at the speed of light off of
[17:47] mobile phones with no intermediary right
[17:50] so that that's interesting how how do I
[17:53] actually do a 100 transactions a second
[17:55] if I'm an AI bot and I want to trip
[17:58] through cyber space right I mean that's
[18:01] interesting you won't do that without
[18:03] digital energy or digital Capital but
[18:06] the other issue is well how do you
[18:08] actually send uh a bunch of capital
[18:10] forward in time 100
[18:13] years right and there's you can't do it
[18:16] with gold you can't do it with a
[18:18] building you can't do it with a share of
[18:20] stock I mean name a company that's still
[18:23] in existence from a hundred years ago
[18:25] off the top of your head where the stock
[18:27] is worth more today
[18:29] in real terms than it was
[18:31] then would be kind of challenging right
[18:34] so so projecting economic energy through
[18:38] time and
[18:39] space has really been more of um of an
[18:44] aspirational
[18:46] fantasy right or an art than it was ever
[18:50] a science or engineering discipline
[18:53] Bitcoin uh it takes something from the
[18:57] artistic
[18:59] and from the religious and from and from
[19:01] the political domain and it moves it
[19:04] into the engineering domain where now
[19:07] there is actually a precise way to move
[19:10] Capital around to store Capital to
[19:14] capitalize you know and I guess your
[19:16] question is how will the world change
[19:20] profoundly right I mean I can create an
[19:23] AI that can live in cyberspace
[19:25] capitalized by Bitcoin that will live
[19:27] forever that'll have econom IC mortality
[19:29] that is that is completely uh Sovereign
[19:33] from a company a person a
[19:36] country that AI could in theory split
[19:39] itself you know go viral and spawn 10
[19:43] million more AIS that are all Sovereign
[19:46] it's a life form right it's right uh I
[19:49] could uh end I can endow a a a
[19:53] university a nonprofit a
[19:56] foundation with Bitcoin that could
[19:59] perceiv cons conceivably l a thousand
[20:02] years without anybody working for it
[20:04] right I can I can create new types of
[20:07] entities I can create companies that
[20:09] don't have a life expectancy of 10 years
[20:11] and I I can create a company with a
[20:13] likely life expectancy of a 100 or 500
[20:15] or a thousand years I can have different
[20:19] missions I can think differently about
[20:21] how I capitalize or finance my
[20:24] country I think think differently about
[20:27] uh how I build every product and service
[20:30] could be different right if you think
[20:32] about products that are around us all
[20:35] all the time you know life insurance
[20:37] products or or any kind of annuity
[20:40] products all of those things right will
[20:42] be disrupted maybe they'll be
[20:46] dematerialized right there's a there's
[20:49] an entire industry that shuffles around
[20:51] 400 trillion of assets so we have $400
[20:54] trillion doll of 20th century analog
[20:57] assets that are inefficient that are
[21:01] toxic that are dilutive and those are
[21:04] handled by a massive Financial
[21:07] establishment that's
[21:09] inefficient right and so you have a very
[21:12] inefficient establishment handling
[21:15] inefficient assets trading them back and
[21:18] forth
[21:20] inefficiently you could obliterate it
[21:22] all you could just replace it all with
[21:24] just I have Bitcoin I hold it I don't
[21:27] need the EST lishment I I don't need the
[21:30] bank to hold it I don't need the Wall
[21:33] Street firm to trade it I don't need to
[21:35] trade it I don't need to diversify
[21:38] across like why do I buy the S&P 500
[21:41] Index why do I have to buy 500 different
[21:43] companies when I know that most of them
[21:46] are not even that good or that
[21:48] successful but I have an
[21:50] entire entire Financial infrastructure
[21:53] to to trade and rebalance inferior
[21:57] assets as a store of
[22:00] value what if you just obliterate it all
[22:04] right maybe it all just goes away
[22:07] so I think the world changes but it
[22:10] it'll change in every sector in every
[22:12] part of the world at a different rate
[22:14] depending upon politics depending upon
[22:17] leadership depending upon
[22:19] culture and there'll be profoundly
[22:21] beautiful things that'll be created that
[22:23] you could have never created before
[22:25] there'll be terrifying things that'll be
[22:26] created that no one conceptualized
[22:29] before and there'll be parts of the
[22:31] world where they do it the same way in
[22:33] 50 years they did it 30 years ago I
[22:36] suppose this also brings me to a
[22:38] question that I planned before I
[22:41] um saw your presentation about global
[22:45] Game Theory right now uh we have in the
[22:48] US election is already Bitcoin a big
[22:50] topic with uh Trump uh accepting it
[22:53] Trump speaking about it EU election I
[22:56] saw the Austrian view of it uh and I
[22:59] never heard any word of Bitcoin crypto
[23:01] or anything of that so in the you it
[23:03] seems to be a non topic till now at
[23:07] least like not a public topic like in in
[23:09] the American elections how do you see
[23:11] right now the global game the with like
[23:14] El Salvador as a small country that goes
[23:17] like bigger steps America making it more
[23:20] uh um more a topic and then EU India
[23:25] China uh how do you see the global Game
[23:27] Theory right now
[23:29] Bitcoin Insight is restricted to those
[23:31] with a need to
[23:33] know love that
[23:35] Ru when you have a need to
[23:38] know when you have a crisis if your
[23:41] country is in crisis if your company is
[23:44] in crisis if your family is in
[23:46] crisis when the bank freezes and fails
[23:49] and the currency crashes and you have a
[23:52] business or you or you have a life and
[23:54] you're in that culture you have a need
[23:56] to know your eyes are open
[23:59] now you now you start to take Bitcoin
[24:01] seriously now you adopt
[24:04] Bitcoin Trump has discovered Bitcoin
[24:07] Trump has a need to
[24:09] know right El
[24:11] Salvador their currency crashed you
[24:15] know they had a need to
[24:18] know I think people in in countries like
[24:22] Lebanon right they don't have a reliable
[24:24] banking system they have a need to know
[24:27] um and uh in places where the society is
[24:31] affluent and the leaders are affluent
[24:33] and they feel comfortable and they don't
[24:35] feel threatened or challenged if they're
[24:37] comfortable in their political um
[24:39] standing if they're not afraid of being
[24:42] of being driven out of office they don't
[24:44] have a need to know if if they're not
[24:47] insecure about their currency if they're
[24:49] not insecure about their Banks they
[24:50] don't have a need to
[24:53] know right in those cases they'll be the
[24:56] latest the last to embrace Bitcoin or to
[25:00] appreciate it because they don't have a
[25:01] need to know but the world's full of
[25:04] places that where you do have a need to
[25:05] know and it's not just places but it's
[25:07] peoples right the minority out of power
[25:12] right who are disenfranchised who
[25:15] disinherited right they used to say
[25:17] about America right who who settled in
[25:20] America it was the second Sons it was
[25:23] the the Second Son settle in America the
[25:25] first son inherited the Family Estate in
[25:28] Europe and the second son wasn't going
[25:30] to inherit anything and so if the second
[25:34] son wanted property a future hope they
[25:38] got on a ship they crossed the ocean a
[25:41] great Peril to themsel because there was
[25:44] an entire continent where they might
[25:45] actually get a start and they might have
[25:47] a chance the second Sons had a need to
[25:51] know and I think Bitcoin is a great
[25:54] equalizer in that regard you know the
[25:57] wealthy a fluent comfortable won't have
[25:59] a need to know they will be blind to it
[26:02] and those who are disenfranchised who
[26:05] are you know who are looking for a
[26:07] better future they will be they are the
[26:10] hopeful ones but they're also The
[26:12] Seekers The
[26:13] Searchers
[26:16] right they're they're going to look
[26:19] they're going to find it they are
[26:21] finding it hundreds of millions are
[26:23] finding it they'll embrace it they'll
[26:26] benefit from it
[26:29] the rest of the world over time will
[26:30] Discover it when they have a need to
[26:33] know and that's why I also love to uh I
[26:36] think it was the last trule even uh
[26:39] where we spread Bitcoin with love and
[26:40] not hate uh because I was also in that
[26:43] time where like this toxic Maxi like oh
[26:45] you have to get Bitcoin like you have to
[26:48] do it but in the last half year year I
[26:52] kind of transform to like oh if you're
[26:54] here if if you have questions I'm here
[26:56] for the community I'm here for everyone
[26:57] who ask questions and want to learn more
[26:59] about Bitcoin and I help you uh and that
[27:03] I love that um rule a lot and how did
[27:06] you come to to that rule uh to to spread
[27:09] Bitcoin with love and not hate and also
[27:12] kind of ties to the other rule with feat
[27:15] uh not not against fat but for
[27:19] Bitcoin well um it comes from a a
[27:23] variety of of different sources my
[27:26] experience in business business as a
[27:29] salesperson and and I've had thousands
[27:31] of sales people that I've worked with or
[27:34] have worked for me over time I've
[27:36] noticed the great ones they go and they
[27:38] offer they offer the customer something
[27:40] and the customer tells them to get out
[27:43] they're stupid they're
[27:44] foolish the product stinks they don't
[27:47] want it they don't need it right really
[27:49] good salespeople they smile they so I
[27:54] understand I'm here I'm here if things
[27:57] change call me if you need me you know I
[28:00] understand you don't have a need right
[28:02] now thank you for your time but here's
[28:04] my card should s circumstances change
[28:08] we'll be we'll be there and when when I
[28:10] was young my first reaction was if the
[28:13] customer said they didn't want to buy or
[28:15] they they criticize my product I would
[28:17] get angry at them and say they're stupid
[28:19] but if you but if you go to a a big
[28:22] there's a phrase the customer is always
[28:24] right if you go to a Big Rich customer
[28:27] whatever it is you know and and they say
[28:29] your product stinks and your reactions
[28:32] well you're too stupid to appreciate it
[28:35] years will go by they'll you know the
[28:38] existing thing they're using will break
[28:40] they will need your
[28:41] product they don't they won't remember
[28:45] whether they were mean to you they will
[28:48] definitely remember if you said
[28:49] something mean to them so if you
[28:52] actually got in a fight with them the
[28:54] first time around then they'll just
[28:56] remember that you were rude to them
[28:58] won't call you back they'll go to vendor
[29:00] b or vendor C or vendor D so it's very
[29:03] bad game theory you know to tell the
[29:07] customer they're wrong especially when
[29:09] they're wrong if the customer is rude to
[29:12] you you don't get rude back you smile
[29:16] you take your beating the customer is
[29:18] always right and you just stay ever
[29:21] present in a cheerful constructive way
[29:24] because over time that sales behavior is
[29:27] the behavior that wins you the customer
[29:29] and eventually you'll have a lot of
[29:31] happy customers and they'll all kind of
[29:33] laugh and and and they'll say yeah you
[29:35] know Mike I don't remember when did we
[29:38] first meet and you know and you'll say
[29:39] well you know the first time we met you
[29:41] kicked me out and told me I was a
[29:43] and they're like I don't remember that
[29:44] at all did I do that I'm sorry I did
[29:46] that you know like and that's the story
[29:48] of life with all sales people everywhere
[29:51] it's like so Think Like A salesperson of
[29:54] course they don't appreciate what you
[29:56] have to offer when they first hear about
[29:58] it because People's Natural reaction is
[30:00] always to reject the
[30:02] new you know another experience I have
[30:04] is just looking at you know behaviors on
[30:07] social media like Twitter someone posts
[30:10] uh you know I don't get Bitcoin it seems
[30:13] stupid to me it's probably bad for the
[30:15] US or bad for the Euro or bad for China
[30:18] or bad for whatever you know if your
[30:21] response is you know your response is
[30:25] well you're just too stupid to
[30:26] appreciate it and I hope you never buy
[30:29] it okay well what you've done is you've
[30:33] just vented FR frustration it's a
[30:35] weakness it it sends the message of
[30:38] immaturity and then the people that are
[30:40] fans of that person the people that are
[30:42] followers of them they don't know what
[30:44] they think one way or the other all they
[30:47] know is you are mean to someone they
[30:48] liked so when your favorite
[30:50] celebrity gets attacked by someone for
[30:53] not understanding Bitcoin people are
[30:56] like I don't know about Bitcoin but I
[30:57] know I like my you know favorite actor
[31:00] or actress or singer so you alienate
[31:03] their followers because of your attitude
[31:06] you don't you know by being angry or
[31:10] hateful so hate never works you're not
[31:13] going to change their mind all you're
[31:15] going to do is swing a bunch of of
[31:18] observers on the
[31:19] fence to take the point of view that
[31:23] you're just irritating and and at some
[31:25] point they just think well you might be
[31:26] right but I don't like you so I don't
[31:29] you know I don't care if you're right I
[31:31] just don't like you're just not a nice
[31:32] person and so there's a lot of people in
[31:34] the world that are neutral and their
[31:36] view is they just don't want to buy from
[31:39] a person they don't like whether you're
[31:40] right or or not what if you understand
[31:44] sales over time you realize that if you
[31:48] had a cure for
[31:51] cancer and the customer was dying of
[31:55] cancer they still aren't going to buy
[31:58] The Cure from you unless you're charming
[32:01] you package it appropriately you knock
[32:03] on their door 10 times you explain to
[32:06] them how it's going to save their life
[32:09] you listen to them yell at you you let
[32:11] them vent you sit through their temper
[32:13] tantrums you find them financing for the
[32:16] cure to cancer you let them disparage
[32:19] you your dog your family your color
[32:21] scheme your logo and you come back and
[32:24] after about the 19th time they'll be
[32:27] like oh yeah oh you have the C to my
[32:30] cancer oh okay I'll take that but you
[32:33] you have to you have to sell it you
[32:36] can't just think that you know I'm
[32:39] brilliant I invented the solution so
[32:41] therefore they should just immediately
[32:44] acknowledge my Brilliance and take this
[32:46] gift I gave them that's just not the way
[32:49] the world works and and if you have that
[32:52] attitude you're just always going to be
[32:54] disappointed you you as a salesperson
[32:58] you would fail right and uh and
[33:02] so I think I I think we're introducing a
[33:05] new
[33:07] idea if someone is open-minded you
[33:09] introduce the idea if they react
[33:12] negatively you know you can't disagree
[33:15] with them head on you can't take a
[33:18] head-on fight what you can do is perhaps
[33:21] introduce a different idea a 90 degree
[33:23] oblike idea you know like I you know I
[33:28] see you think blah blah this is bad for
[33:31] one of your constituents but it would be
[33:33] really good for another one of your
[33:35] constituents right maybe you hate those
[33:38] people on Wall Street but this will be
[33:40] good for the people that you want to
[33:42] help right you can introduce a new idea
[33:45] and then you just have to gra gracefully
[33:47] withdraw and wait for for them to have a
[33:50] need and you just keep yourself in the
[33:52] game
[33:54] right I love it so much because I think
[33:56] this is the one thing that can actually
[33:59] everybody can do and we can actually
[34:01] accelerate Bitcoin adoption uh because
[34:04] if you are the one like I always do it
[34:06] like that when someone comes to me with
[34:07] Bitcoin and they're negative about it
[34:09] like I'm always um I'm I'm not
[34:12] responding badly about it I'm just
[34:14] listening uh and they will come again
[34:17] because they they see Bitcoin in the
[34:18] news they see come with Bitcoin and then
[34:21] they come again and what I'm curious
[34:22] about and you and this was the one
[34:24] question that was in my mind when I
[34:25] heard the presentation um when you said
[34:28] you don't change Bitcoin Bitcoin changes
[34:30] you for me it's really um not quite that
[34:35] because I'm So Young so I got Bitcoin
[34:37] with 21 so it's like I was I was nobody
[34:39] with 21 and I got Bitcoin so like just
[34:42] developed my character uh but with you
[34:44] you got Bitcoin at a latest stage in
[34:47] your life so you already had a lot of uh
[34:50] experience how did Bitcoin change you if
[34:53] at all
[34:58] well
[34:59] first first we
[35:01] um we were looking for a defensive
[35:05] strategy right and so my first
[35:09] experience with Bitcoin was this was a
[35:12] defensive treasury strategy I could use
[35:14] to save my
[35:16] company and um and so I studied enough
[35:21] to conclude I could I could buy it and I
[35:24] and so after I did that I real
[35:28] realized wow there's a lot more to
[35:30] bitcoin than just digital gold just
[35:33] making a digital technology
[35:37] investment and so I started I started
[35:40] actively researching so one way Bitcoin
[35:43] change me is it had me go down the
[35:45] rabbit hole and I started studying
[35:47] economics Austrian economics right
[35:49] Bitcoin led me to read Murray rothbard
[35:53] you know a history of economic thought
[35:55] and to read conceived in Liberties and
[35:56] then it led me to go back and read all
[35:59] of reread all of world history and then
[36:01] it led me into a thousand podcasts and
[36:04] then it led me to you know to listen to
[36:07] to listen to dozens of podcasts you know
[36:10] on bitcoin development and study the
[36:13] Bitcoin Wars and then start thinking
[36:15] about and then it led me to think about
[36:17] the rest of the crypto industry and then
[36:19] it led me to to you know go back and
[36:22] listen to Every Word uttered by Gary
[36:24] gendler you know in a class he T it in
[36:27] my teeth two years before I even knew
[36:28] about I cared about Bitcoin and pretty
[36:31] soon you're reading you're reading books
[36:34] you wouldn't expect to read you're
[36:36] reading every Bill about the crypto
[36:38] industry going through Congress so it
[36:40] sucked me into um into uh the state of
[36:44] being a student again and most of the
[36:46] time you think once you're past the age
[36:48] of 20s something you're not a student
[36:52] anymore right you don't need to be a
[36:54] student and Bitcoin taught me that I
[36:56] really needed to go back can relearn
[36:58] everything I needed to relearn economics
[37:00] I needed to relearn politics I needed to
[37:03] relearn you know technology and then I
[37:06] needed and that led me to go back and
[37:09] look at my own company again and say
[37:11] maybe I need to rethink how we're going
[37:13] to use this and that led us to issuing
[37:17] convertible bonds to buy Bitcoin and
[37:20] that led us to thinking about issuing
[37:22] Equity to buy Bitcoin that led us to
[37:24] thinking well we really it's not enough
[37:26] that we learn how to do it we need to
[37:30] educate other corporations on how to do
[37:34] it when I discovered Bitcoin or or when
[37:37] I first bought Bitcoin I was ready to
[37:40] retire I thought I had you know I had
[37:42] served more than 30 years as a public
[37:44] company
[37:46] CEO I thought you know I have nothing
[37:49] left to prove in the world you know
[37:50] there's not much for me to do I'll just
[37:52] go ahead and retire and gracefully
[37:54] disappear from
[37:56] history and
[37:58] Bitcoin plopped itself into my life and
[38:02] first teased
[38:04] me and then seduced
[38:07] me and then it dragged me on that stage
[38:11] today right and so I was dragged onto a
[38:14] world stage and I found myself now
[38:16] instead of quietly
[38:19] retiring um I was now drawn into a role
[38:24] of advocacy such that I would get on a
[38:25] plane and fly to sollo or fly to uguay
[38:30] or or fly to Prague or you know or and
[38:33] and obsess over things that I never need
[38:37] to obsess over and go back on CNBC or go
[38:40] on Fox go on television and you know and
[38:44] or sit down and record thousand hours of
[38:48] podcast and these are all things that I
[38:50] discovered late in life I would say I'm
[38:52] a late bloomer
[38:54] right like I'm much older than the
[38:56] average bitcoiner right and and so it's
[39:00] like how did this all happen I think
[39:03] it's Bitcoin inspired me maybe inspired
[39:06] me catalyzed me so it changed how I
[39:10] spend my time it's you know it it
[39:12] changed my intellectual interest it
[39:16] changed our corporate
[39:19] strategy and it gave me a mission and I
[39:23] felt compelled to do it right bit
[39:26] Bitcoin serves us all up a mission if we
[39:29] listen carefully to what it has to tell
[39:32] us I love it a lot um from all those
[39:36] rules 21 rules that you presented at
[39:39] Bitcoin Prague what is the favorite one
[39:41] like if you had to pick one and and why
[39:43] is it
[39:46] that I mean I think the most important
[39:49] one is the final one spread Bitcoin with
[39:52] love right bit Bitcoin is the solution
[39:55] to eight billion people's problems bit
[39:58] Bitcoin is
[40:01] is the transformation of capital from
[40:04] analog to digital Bitcoin is the
[40:07] singularity that brings science to
[40:10] economics Bitcoin is instrumental for
[40:13] the human race uh to reach its full
[40:16] potential if we're going to 10x and 100x
[40:19] or a THX from here we can't do it
[40:22] without mastering this sort of digital
[40:26] Capital right without mastering digital
[40:29] energy and
[40:32] um and so we need to spread it to the
[40:35] world whenever something moves
[40:40] faster than uh then the environment can
[40:45] adjust we get a phenomenon known as a
[40:48] shock
[40:49] wave when I move faster than through air
[40:53] faster than the rate at which the air
[40:54] can get out of the way right rate at
[40:57] which the air moves or the air
[40:59] communicates with itself is called the
[41:01] speed of sound it's literally the speed
[41:03] of sound the reason that the sound moves
[41:05] that fast that's how fast the air is
[41:06] carrying it right so when I move faster
[41:09] than the speed of sound I create a shock
[41:11] wave when I create a shock wave there's
[41:13] just Sound and Fury and atomic you know
[41:17] aonic boom and
[41:20] turbulence and uh it's very disruptive
[41:22] it's very
[41:24] painful right and so bit coin is that
[41:28] shock wave moving through the
[41:31] civilization and on one hand we feel
[41:34] impelled to spread it to share it with
[41:37] our friends with our family with our
[41:39] Corporation with our country with our
[41:42] politicians with our
[41:44] intellectuals with our leaders we need
[41:47] to share
[41:49] it but nobody likes being slammed into
[41:54] you know at supersonic speed you know
[41:57] know no that's painful it's a it's the
[42:01] difference between going below the speed
[42:03] of sound and going fast than the speed
[42:06] of sound is the difference between me
[42:09] you know swinging a baseball bat at your
[42:12] head while you're looking that
[42:15] way versus me doing this with a baseball
[42:19] bat saying you should duck I'm about to
[42:21] swing it right one of them is
[42:24] interesting maybe it's entertain p in
[42:28] and the other is
[42:30] brutal and so if we're going to do this
[42:33] we need to do it with love not
[42:34] hate we can't hate people because they
[42:37] reject because they resist because they
[42:40] don't get
[42:41] it right uh we shouldn't we shouldn't
[42:44] think you know that um we need to hate
[42:48] the banks because they don't custody
[42:50] Bitcoin or hate your government because
[42:52] they don't Embrace Bitcoin or hate your
[42:55] boss because the company doesn't buy
[42:57] Bitcoin right that it's a natural
[43:00] reaction but it's an immature reaction
[43:05] what we ought to think is they're going
[43:07] to need it they don't understand it it's
[43:10] understandable they don't understand it
[43:12] it's the most
[43:13] shocking economic thing that's happened
[43:15] in their life maybe it's the most
[43:17] shocking thing to happen in economics in
[43:19] 100,000
[43:21] years it's a fire
[43:23] Raging Fire is scary people run from the
[43:28] fire don't wave the fire in your
[43:30] sister's face right don't set your
[43:34] family on
[43:35] fire right H H have a little bit of
[43:39] consideration there right with such a
[43:43] powerful idea so I think the world's a
[43:46] better place if we spread Bitcoin but I
[43:48] think we got to do it with love thank
[43:50] you you already made it halfway through
[43:51] the video and I'm really really grateful
[43:54] to have you here two things make this
[43:56] channel possible possible you as a
[43:58] watcher and listener who keep supporting
[44:00] this Channel and another one is all the
[44:02] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[44:05] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[44:07] very start and where I personally buy my
[44:09] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[44:11] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[44:13] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[44:17] simplest and securest way to secure your
[44:20] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[44:22] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[44:25] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[44:27] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[44:31] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[44:33] and you know your friend does not have
[44:35] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[44:37] he needs a birthday present and a small
[44:39] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[44:41] 5% off your order plus you support my
[44:45] channel and now let's get back to the
[44:47] video I also see that approach that uh
[44:49] you just described you did with micro
[44:52] strategy and You' explained it uh in a
[44:53] lot of interviews how you like came up
[44:55] with like I want to roduce Bitcoin to
[44:58] micro strategy uh and now you talk about
[45:01] Bitcoin you invest in Bitcoin and now
[45:03] with micro strategy orange you also want
[45:07] to build with Bitcoin um and I asked
[45:10] before this interview uh online on
[45:13] Twitter like what is the question for
[45:14] Michael saor what what should I ask him
[45:17] there are a lot of responses but one of
[45:19] the most common ones was like what's the
[45:22] future of micro strategy and with that
[45:25] also what's the future of Bitcoin
[45:28] scaling layer two layer three technology
[45:31] and and what do we all build on on on
[45:35] bitcoin well micro strategy is going to
[45:37] continue uh to raise Capital to buy
[45:41] Bitcoin we're going to continue to
[45:43] engage in Bitcoin
[45:45] advocacy uh efforts to Advocate Bitcoin
[45:48] institutional adoption for institutional
[45:51] investors we're going to Advocate
[45:53] adoption of Bitcoin by companies both
[45:55] public companies and priv private
[45:57] companies we're going to work on
[45:59] advocating and educating organizations
[46:02] on implementing Bitcoin treasury
[46:05] strategies we're going to spend a lot of
[46:07] time advocating to get um all the
[46:10] financial institutions in the world to
[46:13] embrace and adopt
[46:15] Bitcoin we're going to um continue to
[46:18] develop software we've got great
[46:20] business intelligence software and
[46:22] thousands and thousands of very loyal
[46:24] customers we're enhancing that with
[46:27] digital intelligence what you'll call AI
[46:29] so that's an obvious thing for us to do
[46:32] in our core business but uh we also have
[46:35] R&D efforts in the in uh the Bitcoin
[46:38] business where we we focus upon uh
[46:42] developing applications or integrating
[46:44] things like lightning to see where we
[46:46] can how we might provide that sort of
[46:49] service to
[46:50] Enterprises and we work on ideas like
[46:53] Enterprise identity is there a way for
[46:55] us to combine public private key
[46:58] cryptography and digital
[47:00] signatures and the Bitcoin network with
[47:04] interprise security and cyber
[47:07] security and and uh and anti- fraud
[47:13] anti- fishing you know type
[47:17] software so those are that'll all keep
[47:19] us busy and uh each one of those things
[47:23] is something that uh just takes a lot of
[47:25] time and sensitiv to work
[47:28] out but that doesn't really address your
[47:30] second question which is the bigger and
[47:32] more important question how does Bitcoin
[47:35] scale and I think uh the answer to that
[47:39] question is Bitcoin
[47:42] scales in Myriad ways to say thousands
[47:47] of ways might be an understatement maybe
[47:49] tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
[47:51] millions of ways there are 8 billion
[47:54] people on the planet and every single
[47:57] one of them it encounters Bitcoin is
[47:59] going to think about how they wish to
[48:02] interact with Bitcoin and they've all
[48:04] got a different opinion the
[48:08] three-year-old that that is interested
[48:10] in Bitcoin will have a different view
[48:12] than a 15year old will have a different
[48:15] view than a 20y old a 30y old a 40y old
[48:20] an 85-year-old in China will have a
[48:22] different view than a 92-year-old person
[48:26] in Russia
[48:27] and they will have a different view than
[48:30] someone in the United States in their
[48:33] mid-60s and their views will be
[48:35] different depending upon your
[48:37] religion you know whether you know what
[48:40] your sect is what your profession is
[48:45] what your physical capabilities are and
[48:48] so there's going to be a lot of views
[48:50] there then there's 330 million companies
[48:53] in the
[48:54] world and you know a few of them um
[48:57] there's
[48:59] Apple when Apple encounters Bitcoin and
[49:02] they're one of the more important
[49:03] companies in the world a billion people
[49:04] rely upon them when Apple encounters
[49:07] Bitcoin I think they may look at it and
[49:08] think well wait a minute uh Bitcoin
[49:11] multi- signature Cloud what if we
[49:13] actually make the Apple watch a signing
[49:18] device and combine it with the iPhone
[49:20] and combine it with the third signing
[49:22] device on a laptop and then we do
[49:25] something with the cloud and apple
[49:27] becomes a bank that has hundreds of
[49:31] billions of dollars of Assets in it and
[49:33] we secure that via the Apple
[49:36] Cloud and I suppose if Apple does that
[49:39] then Google will take a different view
[49:41] well we don't want Apple to do that we
[49:43] want that to be done in
[49:45] Android and at some point Samsung will
[49:48] say well wait a minute Samsung phones
[49:50] are used for Android and we can put the
[49:52] secure element in that and we'll take a
[49:55] different View and at some point you're
[49:57] going to have Qualcomm say well wait a
[49:58] minute we provide the chips that are
[50:00] used in these phones and maybe our chip
[50:03] maybe it ought have a Bitcoin miner in
[50:05] it or maybe our chip ought to have a
[50:07] secure element to store your
[50:09] cryptographic keys so that our chip can
[50:11] be the right signing
[50:14] device and then you're G to have all the
[50:16] Chinese companies and and the Chinese
[50:18] government will say well you know maybe
[50:20] we don't want Apple and Google to do
[50:23] this and we want our companies Huawei to
[50:26] do this and so you're going to have
[50:29] you're going to have governments that'll
[50:31] take a view you're going to have
[50:33] companies that are going to take of view
[50:35] you're going to have other companies
[50:37] like block and block is going to say
[50:39] well we want to be better than Apple or
[50:42] Google and so block will ship the bit
[50:45] key and block will embed Bitcoin support
[50:49] Into Cash
[50:50] app and block will do that in the United
[50:54] States but block doesn't operate in
[50:57] China and there's going to be a company
[50:59] in China and they're going to think well
[51:02] maybe we'll just copy what block does
[51:04] and we'll just do it in China and that's
[51:07] going to work for them because the
[51:08] Chinese government's probably going to
[51:10] make it very difficult for an American
[51:12] company to do what American companies do
[51:15] in
[51:16] China so then there's going to be some
[51:18] people that going to say well I don't
[51:20] want to trust a
[51:22] company okay well you know the when you
[51:27] actually buy a coold card or you buy a
[51:29] treasure or a ledger you're trusting
[51:32] company so what do you mean by not trust
[51:34] the company right well I'm not going to
[51:37] trust the company to store my keys well
[51:40] so what are you gonna do I'm gonna I'm
[51:41] GNA buy one of those U steel plate
[51:44] titanium plates and I'm going to hammer
[51:46] my keys on the titanium plate okay well
[51:49] how's that going to get shipped to you
[51:51] well I'm going to FedEx that you're
[51:53] going to trust that company right I'm
[51:55] going to put it in a Bank safe deposit
[51:57] that's another company right there's
[51:59] going to be a whole set of people
[52:01] that'll take a view that I don't trust
[52:03] that company but I'll
[52:04] Trust this or I'll trust
[52:08] myself and that's going to evolve right
[52:11] I I actually think um how does Bitcoin
[52:16] scale you know what you're going to end
[52:18] up with is a a set of
[52:23] entities that uh that self- custody on
[52:27] the base
[52:28] layer um the ogs you know Bitcoin
[52:33] maximalist especially the L ones with
[52:35] large amounts of Bitcoin and they will
[52:37] self-
[52:38] custody then you will see um a set of
[52:43] Bitcoin Banks cash app is a Bitcoin Bank
[52:47] Fidelity and coinbase will be Bitcoin
[52:50] Banks Standard Charter and other
[52:53] custodians and Anchorage
[52:56] they will be Bitcoin Banks you'll
[52:59] probably see 10,000 20,000 50,000
[53:03] Bitcoin Banks and they will be exchange
[53:05] as custodians they'll start to offer
[53:08] other services maybe trading maybe yield
[53:10] maybe credit or maybe just maybe just uh
[53:14] Buy sell in
[53:15] custody but you'll see them and then you
[53:19] know how will the scale you you know you
[53:21] can send Bitcoin cashtag to cashtag
[53:24] right now and it's instant and free and
[53:26] you'll see a lot of that layer three
[53:28] custodial transactions going on but when
[53:32] there's 50,000 or 100,000 Bitcoin Banks
[53:36] they will want to transact
[53:39] highspeed with each other but they
[53:41] probably won't go to the base layer
[53:43] they'll probably go to a layer two maybe
[53:45] a lightning and so you'll see you'll see
[53:48] a lot of Layer Two protocols lightning
[53:50] being the obvious one where people open
[53:52] up channels and you'll see a layer three
[53:54] to a layer three do high frequency final
[53:57] settlements or or settlements with a
[53:59] layer two maybe I want to do 100,000
[54:02] transactions an hour you know and a
[54:06] channel system between 42,000
[54:08] counterparties or or 11,000 or something
[54:11] so I think you're going to see um a
[54:14] growth in layer twos a growth in layer
[54:18] 3es you're going to
[54:20] see layer you're going to see um the
[54:24] transactions on layer one get bigger I
[54:27] mean I don't think the Bitcoin scales by
[54:31] $22
[54:33] transactions you know half the
[54:35] transaction the average transaction size
[54:37] is going to go to 2,000 then 20,000 then
[54:41] 200,000 then 2 million then 20 million
[54:45] maybe at some point you'll see you know
[54:47] the smallest transactions are you know
[54:50] million Fiat terms I mean in Bitcoin
[54:52] terms who knows but but you'll see uh
[54:56] the transactions get much larger on the
[54:58] base
[54:59] layer you see the fees will go up the
[55:02] block rewards will go
[55:05] down right the
[55:07] um there'll be an explosion in layer two
[55:11] options there'll be an explosion in
[55:13] layer three options one day you'll get
[55:16] to the point where you know if everybody
[55:18] with an iPhone can buy sell and send
[55:22] Bitcoin instantly on the
[55:24] iPhone right you might might see a
[55:26] billion transactions a day on that layer
[55:29] three Network and and how will that
[55:32] integrate with Google and everything
[55:33] else who knows I think there'd be layer
[55:36] four is one way that um the Bitcoin is
[55:40] scaling right now is with the ETFs so
[55:42] what is an ETF you know an ETF is
[55:45] wrapped Bitcoin in a way it's like I can
[55:49] I can send you a share of ibit and
[55:54] they're moving 500 mill ion to a billion
[55:57] dollars a day in transaction
[55:59] fees so you're you're talking $
[56:03] 250
[56:05] billion or $300 billion a year in
[56:11] transactions in the ibit
[56:13] network okay so if I said I got an app
[56:15] and people are going to do $300 billion
[56:17] dollars of payments on it you would
[56:18] think that's
[56:20] scaled well you know it is
[56:23] scaling you know people would say
[56:27] well some people don't like certain
[56:28] types of scaling they'll be like I you
[56:30] know there are bitcoiners that don't
[56:32] like the idea that uh that there's money
[56:35] flowing into
[56:36] ETFs but what I would say
[56:41] is 95% of the economic benefit from the
[56:46] arrival of the
[56:48] ETFs has gone to the bitcoiners that
[56:51] don't have ETFs that don't that disagree
[56:54] right if you disagree with with the ETF
[56:57] if you think that's a bad idea and you
[56:59] didn't buy one you made 20 times as much
[57:03] money in the last 5 months as the people
[57:06] that disagree with you and bought the
[57:09] ETF so if your
[57:11] enemy just just gave you 20 times as
[57:15] much as they just got and everybody
[57:17] benefited are they really your enemy
[57:20] right it doesn't seem like it right
[57:22] Bitcoin went from
[57:24] 30,000 to 6 65
[57:27] 70,000 all the people that don't like
[57:29] the ETFs are the beneficiaries 95% of
[57:32] the Bitcoin isn't in the ETFs in
[57:35] fact in fact if you look very closely I
[57:38] think um yeah there's maybe a million
[57:41] Bitcoin in the ETFs but there was
[57:43] 650,000 Bitcoin in grayscale before the
[57:46] ETFs so there's probably only net
[57:50] 1% 1% of the Bitcoin has net flown into
[57:54] flow in the ETF but the price a Bitcoin
[57:56] double which is worth 700
[57:59] billion doar so if I were looking at
[58:02] that I I could say well it looks
[58:06] like
[58:08] $693 billion of economic energy went to
[58:12] people that hate the ETFs because of the
[58:15] ETFs
[58:17] right so you see it's not something to
[58:20] fear right not not on a not on a basic
[58:23] level but they would say but wait a
[58:24] minute they're centralizing
[58:27] 1% 1% of the Bitcoin Supply is is it
[58:30] really centralized 1% is split between
[58:32] 34 33 ETFs that didn't exist other than
[58:36] grayscale so there was grayscale that
[58:38] had 650 Bitcoin and now there's 34 ETFs
[58:42] and they've actually decentralized
[58:44] because most of the Bitcoin in grayscale
[58:46] went into black rock and Fidelity and
[58:48] other places
[58:50] so so um you know it's one of the
[58:52] reasons I say you need to be humble
[58:55] don't don't think you understand Bitcoin
[58:58] better than Bitcoin because it's not
[59:00] clear to me that the ETFs aren't
[59:02] decentralizing the network what's
[59:04] happened with uh the ETFs is they've
[59:08] massively scaled it they've driven the
[59:10] trading of Bitcoin the transactions up
[59:13] they've drawn huge PS of capital into
[59:16] the network they have normalized it
[59:19] they've created lots of political
[59:21] support for
[59:23] Bitcoin um and they saw
[59:26] um they solve a bunch of problems
[59:28] they're applications of Bitcoin that
[59:31] solve problems that impair
[59:33] adoption one problem that they solve is
[59:36] convenience there are a lot of people
[59:38] where like you could pick up the phone
[59:40] and say I want you to buy $22 million of
[59:42] Bitcoin over the next six hours at the
[59:45] average vwap price and you're going to
[59:48] execute that in I don't know 5,000
[59:52] individual transactions you can do that
[59:54] in 10 seconds
[59:56] with uh an ETF and without putting up
[59:59] any money you know whereas before the
[60:03] ETFs that would have taken six months to
[60:06] set up all those accounts and you'd have
[60:08] to sit at your computer and the people
[60:11] that can actually do that of the money
[60:13] they don't have the computer skills
[60:15] right you know you're 22 you can
[60:18] probably trade it at a computer when
[60:19] you're 73 years old and you've got to 20
[60:22] million bucks you can do this hey Bob bu
[60:26] $20 million worth of bitcoin via ibit
[60:29] click that's what you can do so they
[60:32] solved the convenience problem they
[60:34] solve the access
[60:36] problem but they also solve um um a
[60:41] custody problem that person doesn't want
[60:43] a
[60:44] custody you know the 65 year old person
[60:47] they don't they don't want a custody
[60:48] like like I don't want to be kidnapped
[60:51] yeah you think that I you know you think
[60:54] that I want to go on television and say
[60:56] yeah yeah I saw I have all my Bitcoin
[60:57] it's like you know in this key around my
[60:59] neck here please don't kidnap me right I
[61:02] mean those people don't you know you
[61:03] want to have it with an Institutional
[61:04] custodian right and so it solves the
[61:07] problem of custody but then it solves a
[61:08] third problem which is
[61:10] compliance and capital
[61:12] controls
[61:14] um there are a lot of
[61:17] companies let's take Millennium right
[61:20] they have two billion dollars of Bitcoin
[61:22] via ibit VIA these ETFs two billion okay
[61:27] they couldn't buy the underlying Bitcoin
[61:30] if they wanted to they don't buy their
[61:32] Charter it wouldn't it wouldn't meet
[61:34] their compliance roles so they can
[61:36] either buy $2 billion worth of WRA
[61:38] Bitcoin or they can buy
[61:41] zero it's very black and white two
[61:44] billion
[61:46] zero you could you know you can be obos
[61:49] say well blah blah they should just they
[61:51] should set up the account and set up
[61:53] their own keys and do it because if they
[61:55] don't they're stupid but they're not
[61:56] stupid they have more money than you
[61:58] have right I mean they have infinitely
[62:00] more money than everybody that
[62:02] criticizes them they must not be that
[62:04] stupid right they're pretty smart right
[62:06] they make huge amounts of money anybody
[62:08] can accumulate tens of billions of
[62:10] dollars of capital probably isn't you
[62:13] know has something going for them they
[62:15] simply have a system where their
[62:18] compliance controls and their Charter or
[62:20] such that they can trade on a certain
[62:21] set of Exchange in a certain way and if
[62:23] you do business the way they do business
[62:26] business do it their way you get the
[62:28] billion dollar order you do it your way
[62:31] you get the Z order right that's another
[62:33] lesson of sales the customer is right do
[62:37] business the way the customer wants to
[62:39] do it and now let's go to this last
[62:42] Point Capital control how's Bitcoin
[62:44] going to scale well in China Bitcoin is
[62:48] going to scale via an ETF in Shanghai
[62:52] that allows you to buy WRA Bitcoin which
[62:54] will be custody by a bank in Shanghai
[62:57] regulated by and overseen by the Chinese
[63:01] government the Chinese will Embrace
[63:04] Bitcoin they just don't embrace the
[63:07] ability for any individual to take it
[63:09] out of their
[63:11] country right sometimes we get we
[63:14] confuse two
[63:16] objectives do you want you know are are
[63:19] you in favor of Bitcoin being
[63:22] successful or are you in favor of
[63:25] eliminating Capital controls in the
[63:28] world you see this is a political
[63:30] objective you know you might feel that
[63:34] you disagree with the Chinese policy
[63:37] which is you should not be able to move
[63:39] more than $50,000 a year out of
[63:41] China you disagree with that
[63:45] policy but that's not the same as
[63:48] wanting Bitcoin to be successful are you
[63:51] against the Chinese government or or
[63:54] their law or are are you in favor of
[63:57] Bitcoin so you know if you insist that I
[64:02] have to be able to buy non kyc Bitcoin
[64:04] in China and custody it myself and move
[64:07] it you know where I want and not report
[64:10] it to the Chinese
[64:12] government you see you've signed up to a
[64:15] much more ambitious agenda right I'm in
[64:18] favor of complete sovereignty of the
[64:21] individual complete privacy complete
[64:24] freedom to transact
[64:26] and
[64:27] Bitcoin okay
[64:29] fine it is China there's 1.5 billion
[64:34] people in it right and so the question
[64:36] is are you likely to get them to change
[64:38] that policy in the next 12 months or 12
[64:43] years you know you can try to get a
[64:45] country to change your policy it's
[64:47] called Revolution if you have enough
[64:49] guns and you want to top if you want to
[64:51] fight and die for what you believe you
[64:53] can be a Castro or a Stalin or Mau or
[64:57] hoi men or fill in the blank put in your
[64:59] favorite revolutionary you can do
[65:03] it but on the other hand if you just
[65:05] want Bitcoin to be successful when you
[65:08] hear the bank of Shanghai is rolling out
[65:10] a Bitcoin ETF custody to the bank of
[65:13] Shanghai you would say that's great
[65:15] that's going to give access to
[65:16] bitcoin to 1.5 billion people in
[65:21] China okay and they're going to buy a
[65:24] bunch of Bitcoin the price bitcoin's
[65:26] going to go up to $10 million coin so
[65:29] here's the question do you want the
[65:31] billion people in China to be rich and
[65:33] do you want to be rich while the Chinese
[65:36] government still has a bunch of laws
[65:38] that you may or may not agree with or do
[65:41] you want the people in China to be poor
[65:43] and you to be poor while the Chinese
[65:45] government has a set of laws that you
[65:47] don't agree with pretty
[65:49] easy or do you think that you're so
[65:52] great you're Superman that you can just
[65:54] go and topple the entire govern
[65:55] government by barking on
[65:58] Twitter it's like I you know I just
[66:01] don't think right that that you're going
[66:04] to topple you know an entire Sovereign
[66:06] Nation with your ideology
[66:10] so how's Bitcoin scale right Bitcoin
[66:13] scales in layers and it's you
[66:16] know it scales when 100,000 Banks
[66:20] custody Bitcoin it scales with hundreds
[66:24] or thousands of ET f it scales when
[66:27] every technology company builds Bitcoin
[66:29] into their mobile app it scales with a
[66:33] lot of a lot of Bitcoin OG Maxis at the
[66:37] base layer that hold their own keys but
[66:39] even so you put five in a room and let
[66:41] them debate what's their favorite
[66:42] signing
[66:44] device they'll go back and forth right
[66:47] multi- single Sig you know how you know
[66:51] what's your succession plan you know
[66:53] should you give your husband your wife
[66:56] you know your private Keys what about
[66:58] your kids when do you give you know it's
[67:00] like there's a lot of stuff to be worked
[67:04] out so
[67:07] ultimately all adoption is good for
[67:10] Bitcoin right that every single company
[67:12] that Embraces Bitcoin is good when uh
[67:16] when Black Rock Embraces Bitcoin and
[67:19] they launched the ibit ETF what did they
[67:22] do they drive up the price of Bitcoin
[67:24] and create hundreds of billions of
[67:25] dollars of wealth for everybody else
[67:27] what else do they do they created a
[67:29] massive demand for self- custody in the
[67:31] banking system you know a lot of people
[67:34] say not your keys not your coin right
[67:37] well what about the what if the banks
[67:40] want to keep their own Keys like like
[67:42] for example if you're in favor of being
[67:44] able to to keep your own Keys then why
[67:47] would you deny a corporation the ability
[67:49] to keep their
[67:50] keys a bank is a sort of Corporation and
[67:54] they provide custody service for people
[67:58] as a business so why can't they have
[67:59] their keys why can't they have Bitcoin
[68:03] so there's a rule called Sab
[68:06] 121 and Sab
[68:08] 121 was put in place by the SEC and the
[68:11] us and it and it effectively prohibits
[68:13] banks in the United States from custody
[68:16] Bitcoin and when all the ETFs got
[68:20] approved all of the Wall Street firms
[68:23] started lobbying to Sab 121 repealed
[68:27] because they want all those Banks to be
[68:29] able to custody their Bitcoin because
[68:31] they'd like to do business with State
[68:33] Street and B Andy melon and Goldman
[68:35] Sachs and Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan
[68:38] so here you see an example of of uh an
[68:43] organization adopts Bitcoin in a way
[68:45] that isn't the purest
[68:47] idea and that organization lobbies for
[68:50] better regulatory framework to get other
[68:53] organizations to start self- custody
[68:56] Bitcoin and those organizations they
[68:59] they then go and they get everybody in
[69:01] the Senate and everybody in the Congress
[69:02] to vote to repeal the
[69:04] law so the individualist who doesn't
[69:08] believe in a corporation who doesn't
[69:11] Trust Banks who doesn't trust
[69:13] companies that person probably doesn't
[69:16] have the influence to convin the
[69:18] convince the Senate the house you know
[69:21] the banking Lobby you know to vote to
[69:26] repeal a rule that prevents other
[69:29] corporations from cussing
[69:31] Bitcoin so I think there's just a very
[69:34] rich Dynamic and when when I look at
[69:38] Bitcoin I don't I I think it's a
[69:41] mistake to
[69:43] think the network is only scaled if
[69:46] people are nodes right one one uh one
[69:50] conventional model people have which I
[69:51] think leads them astray is that when
[69:53] they think about the network they only
[69:56] think of people like themsel everybody
[69:58] is like like just people like
[70:01] me well why not corporations as
[70:05] nodes what what about family what you
[70:07] know what about when there's 10 people
[70:10] in a family well is that 10 nodes is it
[70:13] has it failed if there's one person that
[70:16] has the money for the other nine well
[70:19] what if the nine are kids between ages
[70:21] of zero and eight why can't one person
[70:24] have the key keys for the 10 kids right
[70:27] and if that's the case then why not a
[70:29] Community Church why not a football club
[70:33] you know why can't the football club
[70:36] have their keys you know why can't the
[70:38] city why can't the company why can't a
[70:42] bank right if if banks hold in hold
[70:46] money in trust for people that are not
[70:48] even alive yet and they're a trustee and
[70:51] there's a there's a reason why not so I
[70:54] think um
[70:55] the network is more
[70:58] decentralized when there are a lot of
[71:00] corporations that are custody Bitcoin
[71:03] right and it's a it's a counterintuitive
[71:05] idea most people think custodians are a
[71:08] bad thing they want non-custodial well
[71:10] wait a minute you're a
[71:12] custodian right why why is
[71:15] it if you're a better custodian than a
[71:18] professional custodian does that make
[71:21] you a better dentist than your dentist
[71:23] and does that make you a better doctor
[71:25] than your doctor and does that make you
[71:27] a better airline pilot than the guy in
[71:29] front of the airplane right now since
[71:31] you're I mean why not just take this to
[71:34] the extreme right if why don't you
[71:37] operate on yourself right so I I I
[71:40] think the early crypto Community had
[71:43] these bad experiences with crappy Fly by
[71:46] Night exchanges and unreliable
[71:48] custodians and it caused them to decide
[71:51] not your keys not your coin but I don't
[71:53] think that's the right lesson for for
[71:55] the next decade I think the right NE
[71:57] lesson for the next decade
[72:00] is you should have everybody you should
[72:04] have a situation where everybody in the
[72:06] world is able to custody Bitcoin every
[72:09] country every company every institution
[72:12] every family every individual every
[72:14] entity and even and even non-persons
[72:17] like what about an
[72:19] AI what if you release an artificial
[72:22] intelligence why can't they custody so
[72:25] in that
[72:26] world things are a lot richer you're
[72:29] like well I don't trust a company well I
[72:32] mean that's stupid you do trust a
[72:34] company you know you were probably born
[72:35] in a hospital where a doctor didn't drop
[72:38] you on ah head and kill you so everybody
[72:41] trust something right you trust a
[72:43] company to generate the electricity that
[72:45] makes the internet work and and
[72:49] so it's really a question of are we
[72:52] going to power up the entire world with
[72:56] digital energy right it's you know it's
[73:00] not just for individuals it's for
[73:03] everybody and
[73:06] everything and
[73:08] um you know I make one last point on the
[73:11] subject which is if you're an individual
[73:14] and you hold Bitcoin in self-
[73:17] custody in uh
[73:21] Austria you're
[73:23] safer if the Bank of England and a bank
[73:27] in Italy and and an EU Central Bank and
[73:30] the fed and a Bank of China all hold
[73:34] Bitcoin right you're because if you want
[73:37] to protect the individual from the
[73:39] crushing power of the nation state when
[73:42] your government decides to take it away
[73:44] from you or or when whatever the local
[73:48] bank decides take it away from you your
[73:50] best protector is their competitor you
[73:53] really want the bank of China to hold
[73:56] Bitcoin they will protect you from a a
[73:59] powerful entity in the US you want the
[74:01] us to hold Bitcoin to protect you
[74:03] against the Russian government you want
[74:06] the Russian government to hold Bitcoin
[74:08] so you want governments to have Bitcoin
[74:10] you want Banks to bitcoin you want large
[74:13] corporations Apple computer will protect
[74:16] you from being victimized by Microsoft
[74:18] and
[74:19] Google if they decide to you know to
[74:22] impair your Bitcoin right maybe Google
[74:24] put some secret thing and they prevent
[74:26] you know prevent you from using Bitcoin
[74:29] freely and their competitor offers you a
[74:31] better
[74:33] solution
[74:35] Integrity Integrity is achieved and
[74:37] security is
[74:39] achieved through balance of
[74:42] power through the balance of power of
[74:44] entities more powerful than you right
[74:48] ultimately you know it's you can't do it
[74:51] yourself you need you need mega Corpses
[74:55] that are Mega powerful but you need more
[74:56] than one and ideally you have a bunch of
[75:00] them in competition with each
[75:02] other when I look at Bitcoin I
[75:06] think you know Hal fenny said maybe the
[75:09] destiny of Bitcoin is to be a high a
[75:12] settlement Network for high-powered
[75:14] money connecting Bitcoin Banks you know
[75:17] if you read his early work there right
[75:20] eventually it's a bunch of Bitcoin Banks
[75:22] and they're settling with each other a
[75:23] 100 million or a billion doll at a time
[75:25] and then they're all doing all these
[75:27] individual
[75:30] transactions but um you know I I look at
[75:35] the
[75:36] Bitcoin and I look at how it's
[75:39] evolving and I think
[75:41] about I think about this uh this vision
[75:45] and it occurs to me that the existing
[75:49] banking
[75:51] system is a 50,000 Banks
[75:56] all primarily capitalized on the
[76:01] dollar right the chines currency is
[76:03] pegged to the
[76:04] dollar Middle East currency is pegged to
[76:07] the dollar the euro is effectively
[76:08] pegged to the dollar the dollar is
[76:10] pegged to the dollar right so you've
[76:12] either got something effectively pegged
[76:14] to the dollar or you've got something
[76:16] collapsing right so the entire world
[76:20] banking system is effectively pegged to
[76:23] uh a Fiat ass asset the dollar which is
[76:28] collapsing whatever 7 to 10% a
[76:32] year and it's all cleared through one
[76:35] node right one Central
[76:38] node and people understand why that's
[76:40] not a good
[76:42] idea but I think it's a mistake to
[76:45] conclude oh and therefore banking is
[76:48] bad the problem is not banking the
[76:51] problem is you have a a a single uh
[76:55] toxic Capital asset and a fragile
[76:59] centralized
[77:00] Network imagine a world where 50,000
[77:04] Banks all used Bitcoin as the capital
[77:07] asset and they cleared peer-to-peer with
[77:10] each
[77:11] other and so I replaced a defective a
[77:15] defective Fiat Capital uh
[77:19] structure with a a perfect monetary
[77:23] structure called Bitcoin and I I
[77:26] replaced a network that cleared through
[77:28] a single node or a very fragile set of
[77:31] correspondent Banks and I replace that
[77:34] with 50,000 Banks clearing peer-to-peer
[77:37] and then hang on that
[77:40] Network 500,000 big
[77:44] companies and then put below that
[77:46] Network hang 50 million
[77:49] institutions and then plug into that a
[77:52] billion families
[77:55] and then step
[77:57] back and ask yourself the
[77:59] question does that feel better or
[78:04] worse than what we have right now in the
[78:07] Bitcoin
[78:08] system and is that better or worse than
[78:11] what we have right now in the Fiat
[78:14] system it feels to me like it's a lot
[78:17] better than the Fiat
[78:19] system right you know if you if you went
[78:21] to the guy that runs the bank of
[78:23] Australia or the bank of Austria or the
[78:25] Bank of China or the bank of whatever
[78:27] you said how would you like to have an
[78:29] asset which doesn't lose 7 to 10% of its
[78:31] value every year and how would you like
[78:33] to be able to settle with any other Bank
[78:35] in the world peer-to-peer
[78:37] it's an upgrade for them right so it's
[78:40] an upgrade to the existing
[78:42] system and then if you look at the
[78:44] Bitcoin system it's like what have I
[78:46] said to you as a bitcoiner you don't
[78:49] have to worry about your nation state
[78:51] attacking you if you're Chinese because
[78:53] the Americans will protect and you don't
[78:55] have to worry if you're Russian about
[78:56] the Russians attacking Bitcoin because
[78:59] the Chinese and the American and the
[79:01] Indians and the Europeans are going to
[79:03] protect the network and if I went to a
[79:06] European said you don't have to worry
[79:07] about your country taking away your
[79:09] Bitcoin because the Americans will
[79:11] disagree and the Chinese will disagree
[79:13] and everybody else will disagree if that
[79:16] was the case then I think you
[79:18] achieve a much greater degree of
[79:21] security and
[79:22] sovereignty and all of these
[79:25] entities that enter the party that join
[79:28] the network they're not making it worse
[79:30] they're making it better for you for
[79:34] everybody and they're and they're
[79:36] entering
[79:38] into a new
[79:40] world and so maybe maybe Banks don't
[79:44] have to be crappy right maybe we can
[79:47] have good
[79:48] Banks right if if we're going to sit and
[79:50] rail about the problem of using Fiat as
[79:53] a store of value we might stop and pause
[79:56] and say well maybe if I ran an
[79:58] institution where I'm required by the
[80:00] regulator to use a defective store of
[80:02] value maybe that's my
[80:04] problem and if this is a
[80:07] alternative maybe we can introduce a
[80:10] solution that will allow them to
[80:13] recapitalize with a better
[80:16] technology and and then you're just left
[80:18] with the question of you know is the
[80:20] institution useful to the world or
[80:22] not and the free market will decide that
[80:26] some banks don't provide any value and
[80:28] they'll disappear but there are certain
[80:30] there are certainly companies that do
[80:32] things that we like done maybe the
[80:34] future biggest bank in the world is
[80:36] Apple
[80:38] computer and Apple's going to give us
[80:40] easy to use safe
[80:43] multisig that six-year-olds can figure
[80:46] out and I don't know but I it seems to
[80:51] me that bitcoin's going to scale with
[80:53] the help
[80:55] of all the big companies with the help
[80:57] of all the big banks with the help of
[80:59] all the governments with the help of of
[81:01] every innovator and every
[81:03] entrepreneur everybody has a role to
[81:05] play in this I think we should welcome
[81:07] them all and you might have an opinion
[81:11] you might be might be thinking well I
[81:13] hate that or I don't like that or I
[81:14] don't like that well it's the free
[81:16] market you're one
[81:18] person are you smarter than the
[81:21] collective intelligence of 8 billion
[81:23] people over the next 00 years including
[81:26] all the 8 trillion AIS that are about to
[81:28] get spun off do you think you're smarter
[81:31] than
[81:32] that and I think I think what Bitcoin
[81:35] teaches you is humility to say no you're
[81:37] not smarter than everybody else in the
[81:38] human race you're certainly not smarter
[81:40] than everyone in the human race that's
[81:42] yet to be
[81:44] born so chill
[81:46] out and let Humanity do its thing and
[81:51] let Bitcoin do its thing cuz it's it's
[81:54] working pretty well so far and I think
[81:56] it'll keep
[81:58] working I love it a lot uh what you just
[82:01] said I'm going I have a thousand
[82:03] questions but uh we have to come to the
[82:05] end routine uh of the podcast and we
[82:07] have a special end routine where the
[82:08] previous guest is asking a question for
[82:10] the next guest without knowing who
[82:12] actually is the next guest and I found
[82:15] that question so soothing for you uh
[82:18] which brings in a whole maybe a whole
[82:20] new topic uh what is the one thing uh
[82:23] that you have that is really important
[82:25] for you that you could not buy with
[82:31] money a mission a mission right right uh
[82:37] the Bitcoin mission right that's that's
[82:39] very important to me the opportunity to
[82:42] to make a contribution to the human race
[82:44] by introducing and advocating this new
[82:48] idea and uh before Satoshi I didn't have
[82:52] that and after Satoshi I have that and
[82:56] uh I'm very grateful for that
[82:58] opportunity gives a mission Gives Life
[83:01] Meaning I love it a lot and I usually
[83:05] ask my guest uh before I end the podcast
[83:08] uh to to shout out their their channels
[83:11] but I think everybody already knows you
[83:13] and everybody already follows you uh so
[83:15] I just end with like a thank you and
[83:17] that's the one question uh the one input
[83:19] from my community uh that I got a lot I
[83:22] should say thank you to you uh for
[83:24] taking the time to actually um make the
[83:27] Bitcoin adoption drive and this is a
[83:29] really cool Mission and extremely great
[83:33] that we have you on our Bitcoin team and
[83:35] we appreciate that a lot so thank you
[83:37] Michael and I think I can speak for uh
[83:40] some of my communities uh when I say
[83:42] thank you for that thanks for the
[83:45] opportunity perfect then uh I'll be back
[83:47] tomorrow with another episode bye-bye
[83:51] [Music]
