[00:00] the world will be fully Bitcoin Nigeria
[00:03] has the highest Bitcoin adoption rate
[00:05] from all the countries for Africa to
[00:08] grow we need to be connected to the
[00:10] global market and for that to happen
[00:12] there must be decentralized solutions
[00:14] that is 100% reliable and not controlled
[00:18] by the government and I feel Bitcoin is
[00:20] actually doing that in Africa gives
[00:22] everyone the chance to be included in
[00:24] the financial world right we've seen
[00:26] countries declaring Bitcoin as their
[00:28] legal tender we've seen presidential
[00:31] candidates making sure they aligned with
[00:34] the Bitcoin networks in order for them
[00:36] to be able to like gain favor of the
[00:38] people that's to tell you that the
[00:40] Innovation itself has a very huge
[00:42] acceptance Bitcoin infrastructure that
[00:44] doesn't need internet connection for you
[00:46] to send Bitcoin across different borders
[00:49] I I can literally send Bitcoin to
[00:51] someone in South Africa right now
[00:53] without internet connection and I'm
[00:55] proud to tell you I'm going to do that
[00:57] with just SMS
[01:02] when we look at Africa and we look uh
[01:04] also like at at Bitcoin at uh what what
[01:07] amazing chance also Bitcoin has for this
[01:09] country it's it's it's really cool to
[01:12] see that uh Nigeria I think has the
[01:15] highest Bitcoin adoption rate from all
[01:18] the the countries maybe El Salvador is a
[01:20] Little Bit Stronger now but it because
[01:22] it's top down um why do you think uh in
[01:25] Africa and especially in Nigeria there
[01:28] is such a high uh adoption rid of of
[01:30] Bitcoin yeah um in Nigeria where while
[01:36] we've been seeing the ey adoption of
[01:38] Bitcoin and um cryptocurrency
[01:41] instruments is basically because
[01:44] Dynamics and situations on ground in
[01:47] this jurisdiction has been able to shape
[01:49] people experience into being hungry for
[01:53] solutions that actually work and Soles
[01:57] their financial problem and what do I
[01:59] mean by that in in this country it's
[02:04] more like a country that is import
[02:07] dependent a country that is trade
[02:09] dependent specifically in oil and other
[02:12] sector of the country around
[02:14] agricultureal manufacturing and lots of
[02:17] stuffs like that and countries like that
[02:21] needs access to Foreign Exchange in the
[02:24] market right but in situation of Nigeria
[02:28] Nigeria is using naira and this currency
[02:31] is not a Global Currency it's being pair
[02:34] with other currencies across African
[02:37] countries about 41 different currencies
[02:40] and um there are businesses and
[02:43] investors who are willing to like move
[02:45] in
[02:47] money out and back into the country so
[02:51] they need um payment rails that are
[02:54] Swift they need technologies that are
[02:57] fast and um at least reliable than the
[03:02] existing traditional payment rails that
[03:05] takes at least three to four days for
[03:08] the west transa from the fastest
[03:11] transactions for them which is wire
[03:13] transfer so but with Bitcoin and um
[03:17] crypto instrument I mean stable coins
[03:19] like usdt um we've
[03:22] seen Solutions we've seen this
[03:25] technology
[03:27] mitigating the risk in transactions and
[03:31] offering efficient solution for problem
[03:34] around remittance so the adoption of
[03:36] Bitcoin in general as far as Nigeria is
[03:39] concerned is been sh shaped by dynamics
[03:43] of um existing problem that an existing
[03:47] technology is openly and willing to
[03:51] offer solutions to so um I think
[03:54] Nigerians are now aware and um they
[03:57] actually opting between um the truth and
[04:02] the
[04:02] force and what works for them and I
[04:05] think Bitcoin position itself as that
[04:08] remittance and solution to to to the
[04:12] problem on grounding in this area it's
[04:15] really cool and when you look at
[04:16] remittance that's also an interesting
[04:18] topic for for Africa because it gives
[04:20] gives the gives everyone the chance to
[04:23] be included in the financial world right
[04:25] it's it's like uh I I know that from
[04:28] Austria people don't get that problem
[04:31] but it's all around the world that
[04:33] people are not banked that people have
[04:34] not access to the full Financial system
[04:38] um that's that's some that's something
[04:40] that I'm like thinking a lot about
[04:42] because Bitcoin can actually solve that
[04:44] in a in a in a lot of ways um why um is
[04:49] now Bitcoin such a great opportunity for
[04:51] remittance in Africa but also maybe it's
[04:54] Bitcoin mining and other things that
[04:56] Bitcoin can do for for the country
[05:00] yeah um I'm going to respond by saying
[05:03] Africa is actually a a continent blessed
[05:07] with vast resources and um vast
[05:11] Resources with some indigenous
[05:14] challenges that um localized Solutions
[05:18] will be um the best approach to solve
[05:23] um and giving a clear picture to your
[05:27] question I'm going to say um Bitcoin
[05:31] offers the chance to be able to create
[05:34] localized solutions to solve African
[05:38] problem and um the need for adoption or
[05:43] the search for adoption in this
[05:45] continent um specifically around um the
[05:49] Practical aspect that deals with medium
[05:52] change and also around um the Practical
[05:56] aspects that deals with um generating
[05:59] Revenue probably through Mining and also
[06:02] like um reducing carbon credits by
[06:05] making sure the mining operations are
[06:08] being done in are being sourced from
[06:11] renewable energy um initially in my
[06:16] response I said Africa is a vast
[06:18] continent um I mean when you want to
[06:20] like reference in terms of what Bitcoin
[06:22] is doing concerning the mining aspect in
[06:25] Africa I made a publication showing that
[06:29] Nigeria has the required energy
[06:31] resources to um Venture into Bitcoin
[06:35] mining we have about two to three
[06:38] Bitcoin mining Farms that are
[06:41] operational on large scale in Nigeria as
[06:43] we speak while we have um a vast amount
[06:47] of miners operating in countries like
[06:50] Kenya power um powering their operations
[06:54] with Hydro I I won't forget to reference
[06:57] greedless on that note and also in
[07:00] Ethiopia um we've seen huge mining
[07:05] operations with Hydro as well and when
[07:09] you check the
[07:10] electricity um cost in this jurisdiction
[07:13] it's quite competitive and um cost
[07:17] effective when you compare them with the
[07:19] electricity cost in countries like China
[07:22] um United States and other wellknown
[07:25] countries that indulge in mining I think
[07:28] we have cheap electricity in kazakstan
[07:30] as well but when you check African
[07:32] countries like Kenya Ethiopia
[07:35] Nigeria the
[07:37] con you you tend to see more viability
[07:41] you tend to see um Bitcoin mining
[07:44] operations being powered by um green
[07:47] energy being powered by um fare gases
[07:51] for instance Nigeria um has a lot of
[07:54] flar gases as an oil producing country
[07:57] and um
[07:59] there are there are opportunities
[08:01] available with Bitcoin on the mining
[08:04] aspect in situations whereby um these
[08:08] flare gases can be contained and like um
[08:12] get electricity Sol from it and then um
[08:16] increase carbon credit for the country
[08:20] and then enable another revenue for the
[08:22] country through Bitcoin mining coming
[08:25] from the fare gases whereby whereby
[08:28] communities where those Oil Company
[08:32] operations are going on can even get
[08:34] free electricity from the electricity
[08:37] generated from those play gases and the
[08:40] Bitcoin mining operation so these are
[08:42] not just um these are not just
[08:45] suggestions or insights about um the
[08:49] African space but these are things that
[08:51] are happening on site I think I
[08:53] mentioned some company greedless in in
[08:55] Kenya troan mining in Nigeria and then
[08:59] um bgs Services
[09:03] block block green services in in Congo
[09:07] there's also like mining operation at
[09:10] the Vera Park as well so um with
[09:14] consistent um adoption with consistent
[09:17] Enlightenment about the opportunity on
[09:19] this continent I feel Bitcoin adoption
[09:22] will keep growing more that's on the
[09:24] mining side on the remittance side um
[09:27] the top 10 country leading in terms of
[09:31] remittance in subaran Africa Nigeria
[09:34] South Africa and um some other countries
[09:38] from North Africa uh I think Algeria you
[09:42] you notice that these countries need
[09:45] access to the global market and their
[09:47] local currency is inflationary and then
[09:52] not widely accepted globally but in that
[09:55] time Bitcoin is widely accepted and the
[09:58] um REM
[09:59] fee the transaction fee is actually more
[10:04] considerate and extremely low than what
[10:07] we have in the traditional banking
[10:09] system the traditional banking systems
[10:12] charges take huge charges and the
[10:15] remittance process is very low in my
[10:18] recent publication for Bitcoin magazine
[10:20] I talked about the opportunities for
[10:22] Bitcoin remittance in West Africa I went
[10:27] I I made sure I made clear elucidation
[10:30] up to the um up to comparing the FX cost
[10:35] that's the foreign exchange cost and the
[10:38] fees being charged by Traditional Bank
[10:41] in comparison to digital payment RS that
[10:44] is Bitcoin and usdt options that
[10:46] available for them and um that comparism
[10:49] I cited the world bank statistics about
[10:52] that and I feel when you look at this
[10:55] situation you see that for Africa to
[10:58] grow need to be connected to be to the
[11:01] global market and for that to happen
[11:04] there must be a decentralized solutions
[11:06] that is 100% reliable and um not
[11:11] controlled by the government to be able
[11:13] to Foster such um access to the global
[11:17] market and I feel Bitcoin is actually
[11:19] doing that in Africa H the adoption rate
[11:23] we are seen I think the government are
[11:24] aware of that they came up with cbdcs
[11:27] they came up with
[11:29] other um fat incentives that looks like
[11:34] what Bitcoin is but then I think it's
[11:36] obvious for people they start
[11:38] questioning the process in which the
[11:40] government is bringing up those digital
[11:43] currency can this digital currency solve
[11:45] the problem of inflation can this
[11:48] digital currency solve our existing
[11:50] problem on crossb remittance is United
[11:53] States willing to accept en for USD or
[11:58] can I get to C
[12:00] and easily off ramp to their local
[12:03] currency no the answer is no but when
[12:06] you put all this question and put
[12:08] Bitcoin by the side and ask is it cost
[12:11] effective the answer is yes is the
[12:14] transaction going to be instant or
[12:16] faster than the Traditional Bank the
[12:17] answer is yes is this solving crossb
[12:21] remittance problem that we are facing
[12:23] can I get to Kad or can I get to Kenya
[12:26] and say I want to sell this for local
[12:29] currency the answer is yes and um these
[12:32] are being done by African Centric
[12:34] products that dependent on bitcoin
[12:36] Innovation so in general I'm going to
[12:39] say um Bitcoin has been helping this
[12:43] continent on all aspect that it tends to
[12:46] um to to cater force in in a practical
[12:50] way that is the mining aspect the
[12:53] remittance aspect and the education
[12:56] aspect too in terms of giving people
[12:59] awareness and getting them inclined with
[13:02] the right solution it's really
[13:03] interesting especially the cbdc and the
[13:06] remnant part uh as it's it's for me uh
[13:11] really see interesting to see where like
[13:13] when you look at uh continents like
[13:16] Africa when you look at continents uh
[13:19] that just need a better Financial system
[13:21] I mean everyone needs that like we we
[13:25] all can can need that but um Nigeria as
[13:29] I remember tried the naira I tried
[13:34] cbdcs um why did the people don't accept
[13:39] it like why did it fail and what's the
[13:41] current state of like the the cbdcs in
[13:44] Africa are they still pursuing that do
[13:46] they still want to push cbcs in
[13:49] Africa um yes I'm going to see a
[13:54] response to your question is um you
[13:56] asked multiple questions in one um you
[14:00] asked questions about why did the cbdc
[14:03] fail you also asked question about what
[14:07] what's people reaction to it the third
[14:10] question is are they still pursuing it
[14:12] and um what's on ground in Africa and
[14:15] all of that I'm going to come up with
[14:18] the response for the first question is
[14:20] why did the cbtc fail I think the cbdc
[14:24] in Nigeria happens to be a failed
[14:25] project from onset um it was started by
[14:29] the previous administration of general
[14:31] mohammedi and um when you see the um
[14:35] operating mechanism the architecture put
[14:37] in place for this Central Bank digital
[14:39] currency we have the um phase one phase
[14:42] two and phase three the phase one is
[14:45] more like the initialization State the
[14:47] phase two is like the um adoption stage
[14:50] and the phase three is like the
[14:52] expansion stage for
[14:54] like um making it a payment r with other
[14:59] countries and all of that but then when
[15:02] you as a technical person the first
[15:04] thing Nigerians just get to question
[15:08] about this Central Bank digital currency
[15:11] is how is this different from the
[15:13] existing Ira we have right now is the en
[15:17] not
[15:19] inflationary the question the answer to
[15:22] that question is it is inflationary that
[15:26] is it keeps reducing citizens purchasing
[15:31] power over time just the way na keep
[15:33] reducing their purchasing power over
[15:36] time due to consistent printing by the
[15:38] government who is behind this cbdc who
[15:42] controls it is still the central bank
[15:44] right and um can I trade with a Chinese
[15:47] counterpart or a United stat counterpart
[15:50] with this Ina the answer is no and um
[15:54] when we check the problems Nigerians are
[15:57] facing in terms of fin
[15:59] um in terms of finance and financial
[16:02] inclusion you see folks have restricted
[16:06] assets to internet there are some places
[16:09] with poor internet connections there are
[16:10] some places where um you you want to
[16:14] like trade you you can't easily trade
[16:17] with a foreign partner um because of
[16:19] your currency you you are also very very
[16:23] afraid because your currency doesn't
[16:25] have a stable rate with the partner you
[16:27] are willing to trade with so the cbdc
[16:31] doesn't Sol any of this problem these
[16:34] are my reasons and why I would say it
[16:36] filed from
[16:39] onset and two to your question of are
[16:44] people using it now people are not using
[16:46] it because even when this cbdc was
[16:49] created the technical infrastructure for
[16:51] it to operate seamlessly was not in
[16:53] place um you check on the Block
[16:57] blockchain technology been used is a
[16:59] centralized blockchain um unlike what we
[17:03] have in Bitcoin that is distributed lger
[17:06] um um on on the CBD side on the cbdc
[17:10] side is an i leer Fabrics um I think if
[17:14] I'm not mistaken um the central control
[17:18] is directly owned by the Central Bank of
[17:23] Nigeria and when you check the Central
[17:25] Bank of Nigeria what they've been known
[17:27] for is um to keep printing more n into
[17:31] circulation um to keep giving
[17:34] restrictive policies that enables um
[17:39] that enables digital currency to thrive
[17:42] specifically the decentralized one um
[17:45] you you see situations whereby the same
[17:48] government comes up with freezing people
[17:51] accounts during
[17:53] Civil Rights like during protest andas
[17:57] protest the recent one bad governance
[17:59] process so when you compare and contract
[18:02] this um no infrastructure on ground um
[18:06] you can easily trade the Ina even with
[18:09] your local banks app there was
[18:11] integration with local banks app but it
[18:15] came at a time when the country is going
[18:18] through a lot of financial Agony
[18:21] specifically it was during those period
[18:24] that the den Central Bank governor of
[18:27] Nigeria got
[18:29] came up with redesigning the physical
[18:32] cash it came up with restriction like um
[18:35] um withdrawal limits um cash deposit
[18:38] limits and a lot of stuffs like that so
[18:42] um this
[18:43] alone created an
[18:46] atmosphere an atmosphere that make
[18:49] things child for Nigerians and they say
[18:52] I I
[18:53] mean what exactly is the need for this
[18:56] cbdc um I must be honest with you some
[18:59] might not understand the technical part
[19:02] they might not understand the risk
[19:04] involved but the fact that it doesn't
[19:07] work immediately the fact that it
[19:09] doesn't solve basic things um it doesn't
[19:13] make the currency more accessible to to
[19:17] a paper seller so they they literally
[19:20] feel this is a noo area and the fact
[19:23] that it gives government more power to
[19:26] censor anybody they willingly want to
[19:29] censor it gives government more power to
[19:32] know what you you are actually spending
[19:35] your money on I mean you can have cash
[19:37] and keep it at home for a long time and
[19:39] then decide to wake up probably in the
[19:41] midnight and buy bread with the cash the
[19:44] government will know you you you you
[19:47] have your cash with you but they won't
[19:49] know what you spend that cash on
[19:51] specifically but with cbdc I mean if you
[19:54] are buying Stu like groceries whatever
[19:56] you are buying it's documented on the
[19:59] ler the the receiver you sending to is
[20:02] also documented so your financial life
[20:05] is pretty tracable so those are the
[20:08] things and risk connected to this
[20:10] Central Bank digital
[20:12] currency that's why it's not scaling
[20:15] that's why people are not accepting it
[20:17] on on on that hand so um I believe I
[20:22] must have been able to do justice to
[20:24] your question and the last question will
[20:26] be um what's happening regarding in
[20:29] Africa one interesting thing you need to
[20:31] not is that when United States comes up
[20:35] with a policy Nigerian and countries
[20:38] like South Africa tends to like study
[20:41] those policies and see can we integrate
[20:43] this policy in our JIS as well we've
[20:46] seen situation where Nigeria is like oh
[20:49] um picking up from United States
[20:53] Constitution citing example saying
[20:56] democracy is being run here this is how
[20:59] democracy should be in Africa as well so
[21:01] it comes down to like policy as well we
[21:04] also have security Exchange Commission
[21:06] in Nigeria when the crypto ban happened
[21:09] when the P2P restriction happened it was
[21:13] due to like the volatility on the
[21:15] currency so most African countries check
[21:18] on what is going on in United States why
[21:22] most most countries in Africa also check
[21:27] on what is going on in countries like
[21:30] Nigeria and South Africa these are
[21:32] countries with the highest GDP these are
[21:35] countries with the biggest economy in
[21:37] Africa so um when Nigeria launched
[21:41] cbdc we we we start
[21:45] seeing we start seeing other African
[21:48] countries coming up with the framework
[21:50] of launching their own CBD and where you
[21:52] check this Frameworks you see
[21:54] similarities between these Frameworks
[21:57] and the present en framework of of of
[22:01] the cbdc in Nigeria so it shows that um
[22:06] Africa as a continent and the countries
[22:09] there in is gr towards um embracing
[22:14] Innovation but embracing it in a way
[22:17] that will not take them as Government
[22:21] out of the um body of controlling the
[22:25] financial landscape and the problem we
[22:27] have majorly in Africa is the the trade
[22:31] the trading rails are too stent I can't
[22:35] move from Nigeria to other count so um
[22:38] in general the CB I can't move from
[22:40] Nigeria to other country and spad my
[22:43] local currency on like probably the way
[22:46] you can move from Germany to other
[22:48] European countries that that spend Euros
[22:52] or something currency that easily
[22:54] related to each other and still spend
[22:56] easily unlike having infrastructures
[22:59] like for instance zel P all these things
[23:03] that are still compatible it's not like
[23:05] that on the African so so the
[23:08] cbdc um
[23:10] Frameworks are been emulated by some
[23:14] African countries which is something I
[23:16] don't feel is great but the moment they
[23:19] see it low adoption in Nigeria as well I
[23:23] think that is also sending signal to
[23:25] them to to be able to like um know that
[23:28] people don't actually want this cbdc not
[23:31] only in Nigeria alone I need I think in
[23:33] Bahamas I think in in China as well the
[23:37] cbdc is not thriving and the the the the
[23:41] question behind this is not farfetched
[23:45] it's just people um are not interested
[23:49] in solutions that doesn't S problem in
[23:53] real
[23:56] time that's a that's a great saying that
[23:59] there people are not interested in
[24:00] solutions that don't solve problems I
[24:02] love that a lot um and you also
[24:04] mentioned an interesting point with uh
[24:06] that you're not able to spend your
[24:08] currency in Africa everywhere in in
[24:10] Africa because in Europe it actually is
[24:13] like you can spend the euro in the whole
[24:15] European Union uh and you can even spend
[24:18] it outside of that I was in Egypt like
[24:20] two years ago uh and I did not need it
[24:24] to buy the local currency because
[24:26] everyone there EX accepted the Euro like
[24:29] in in in Egypt you can buy uh most of
[24:33] the things uh from everyone just with
[24:36] the Euros so like the euro is even
[24:37] accepted outside of the European Union
[24:40] and this is not true for for the African
[24:43] uh currencies so that's that's a that's
[24:45] a
[24:46] major that's a major thing that will
[24:48] happen uh when we are on a Bitcoin
[24:51] standard where everyone has the same
[24:54] currency and it does not matter who you
[24:56] are or where you're from you can just
[24:58] spend your money because everyone
[25:00] accepts your money as as money and
[25:02] that's a thing that that's a big thing
[25:04] that will happen with with Bitcoin um I
[25:09] have a question I wanted to ask it later
[25:10] but I will ask it now because it suits
[25:12] so good now um how do you think will
[25:17] Bitcoin uh change the global landscape
[25:21] in general when we all of the sudden
[25:23] have a Bitcoin standard like when we
[25:25] zoom out like maybe in 20 40 50 60 years
[25:29] how long how long it will will take I
[25:31] don't know but when we have a Bitcoin
[25:34] standard how do you think this will look
[25:37] like what what are the major things that
[25:39] you see will change on a Bitcoin
[25:42] standard uh and What problems will this
[25:45] solve and maybe also What problems will
[25:48] be still there what what problems do uh
[25:51] does Bitcoin not solve wow um I think
[25:55] that's a great question um
[25:58] I think it takes a lot of time and
[26:01] effort for us to attain um IPI Bitcoin
[26:06] iation that's the term I'm going to use
[26:09] that is a state whereby Bitcoin is
[26:12] widely acceptable and it's been used by
[26:16] everyone one these are some of the
[26:18] problems that is going to solve and it's
[26:20] going to take away from the picture the
[26:23] problem of inflation will be gone
[26:27] because because inflation is purely
[26:32] orchestrated and bound to happen um cut
[26:37] seal of the government or any parast in
[26:42] control of Finance or money in a
[26:44] particular jurisdiction but with Bitcoin
[26:48] I think Satoshi is taking that out of
[26:49] the picture it's making everybody the
[26:53] governing body and um with that trading
[26:57] will be be General that is using Bitcoin
[27:01] as medium of exchange will be General um
[27:04] we won't have a situation whereby some
[27:06] people acquire weth through illicit
[27:10] means by not having a proof of work for
[27:13] such wealth um that's like saying
[27:17] inflation will be gone because the the
[27:21] government of people in control of money
[27:24] now will not be in control of money as a
[27:26] politician if you are so close to the
[27:28] Central Bank digital to the central bank
[27:31] Governor um you guys can have ways of um
[27:37] enriching yourself as politician we've
[27:39] seen such situations in corrupt
[27:42] countries where political office ERS try
[27:45] to like emle government money and all of
[27:49] that but as far as Bitcoin is concerned
[27:51] I think is going to create an
[27:53] environment that depends on proof of
[27:57] work and an environment that takes um
[28:00] politicians or probably people who can
[28:03] easily EMZ fund out of the picture
[28:05] because of the network being
[28:07] transparent
[28:09] um because the transactions will be open
[28:12] to every citizen to see the the the way
[28:17] monies are being spent for contracts
[28:20] will be transparent just like we'll see
[28:21] in nextv when the government get to
[28:24] purchase currencies you you it's open
[28:26] you don't need any want to tell you the
[28:29] government is purchasing or selling or
[28:31] the money attributed for contract is not
[28:33] being spent on the materials for the
[28:36] contract because you can easily Trace
[28:38] down those transaction to the level of
[28:42] where the raw materials are been ped for
[28:45] for any money allocated to it so it
[28:47] brings transparency I think it's going
[28:49] to like get rid of corruption and a lot
[28:52] of human errors in finance it's going to
[28:55] like Aid the concept of
[28:58] store of value store of value in the
[29:01] sense that um Bitcoin will now keep
[29:06] gaining more value against other
[29:08] Commodities like land um building real
[29:12] estate um and a lot of U add Metals
[29:16] probably gold diamond or silver so um
[29:22] General acceptance of Bitcoin will
[29:25] change the financial status quo is going
[29:27] to change the financial narrative in
[29:31] terms of remittance there will be easy
[29:34] trading options there will be products
[29:37] that enables that it's going to change
[29:41] the um entire connection of the world
[29:46] specifically people in the global South
[29:48] and the West someone from my Village
[29:51] will now be able to like um easily
[29:53] transact with someone um from France us
[29:58] and someone from um Washington will be
[30:01] able to easily transact with anyone
[30:03] probably from
[30:05] P or any part of Tanzania or Malawi or
[30:08] Nigeria so it's going to be an open
[30:11] world and an open world with free trade
[30:14] free trade
[30:16] is a good word it's a word that is
[30:20] scalable it's going to be a peaceful
[30:23] word and I think the fact that um the
[30:27] fact that
[30:29] it has limited Supply would also help in
[30:35] diversification diversification in the
[30:37] sense that the entire Finance Market
[30:41] globally and also in Africa will now be
[30:44] subjective and controlled by demand and
[30:48] Supply that can't be tampered with
[30:51] demand and Supply that can be influenced
[30:55] so and um when we we are talking about
[30:58] Bitcoin as bitcoiners or as someone who
[31:01] is soen about Finance we always take
[31:03] back the picture to the context of money
[31:07] um it's going Bitcoin General acceptance
[31:10] is going to like um create the greatest
[31:14] trust in finance um why still taking
[31:17] trust out of the picture so um I I I
[31:20] will give more explanation to this
[31:22] creating the trest Trust In finances
[31:25] that we will not have to depend on
[31:27] government decree to determine what
[31:29] money is we will be able to um depend on
[31:33] bitcoin and it consens mechanism to
[31:37] determine what money is um government
[31:41] decrees when um probably I have to
[31:44] believe that the United States dollar is
[31:46] money because of the United States
[31:49] dollar decree of saying US dollar is
[31:53] acceptable and it's going to be money so
[31:56] um this takes go back to the evolution
[31:59] of money it means Bitcoin will be the
[32:02] true currency that people can trust it
[32:05] means people will not have doubts in
[32:07] government policies to change the U
[32:11] situation of what their money is all
[32:14] about I think there are situations in
[32:16] Ukraine when there's war and um you see
[32:21] people getting their bank account locked
[32:23] you see Bank not operating again their
[32:27] situation in Nigeria where you see the
[32:29] Central Bank governor coming to tell you
[32:32] that the previous Nar note you are
[32:34] spending is not valid anymore starting
[32:37] from this date they will be introducing
[32:40] Mila not Bitcoin will take all that out
[32:44] of the picture and make sure that the
[32:46] validity of money is actually what money
[32:48] should be and um I feel it's going to be
[32:51] a great opportunity for the lower and
[32:54] middle class as well it's going to
[32:56] easily connect them to the um upper
[32:59] class it's going to make Finance more
[33:03] efficient than what it is right now with
[33:05] the ectic traditional Finance system so
[33:09] I feel this
[33:11] um intensive explanation about what
[33:14] Bitcoin will really do must have been
[33:16] able to do justice to your question um I
[33:20] feel we can keep talking about this from
[33:22] now to a long time because Bitcoin
[33:26] itself is Bash
[33:28] and it's doing a lot um Bitcoin is
[33:32] actually for Humanity because it's
[33:34] reducing the RIS in terms of climate um
[33:38] it's making the the world the better
[33:42] place uh about 54% of um Bitcoin mining
[33:47] operation is done through renewable
[33:49] energy so if Bitcoin is widely accepted
[33:52] I think the mining operations will be
[33:54] power mostly by um solar wind
[33:58] hydro and um clear gases and when we do
[34:03] this we
[34:04] have a more green world and um The
[34:09] Greener the word becomes the better it
[34:12] is for us who are the inhabitants I I
[34:16] feel this is going to be a great
[34:18] milestone and um just as Mike
[34:22] has always been saying um Bitcoin will
[34:26] end up
[34:28] being the best saving technology as it
[34:31] has always been and people will get to
[34:34] like understand more about the
[34:37] Innovation over time and based on your
[34:40] question I feel leveraging time and
[34:43] patience we are actually going to get a
[34:45] situation whereby the world will be
[34:49] fully hyper biton and um thank you Robin

[36:37] make sure to check out the link in the
[36:39] description for this amazing coin
[36:41] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[36:44] amazing I love them so much it was
[36:46] really hard for me to pick the one that
[36:48] I want to have because there are a lot
[36:50] of great options I went with the new
[36:53] transparency Edition they're all limited
[36:56] so grab your course those will not be
[36:58] available for a long time but there will
[37:00] come new models and new amazing designs
[37:03] along the way yeah that's a it's an
[37:06] amazing answer I love that a lot I also
[37:08] love how how you package everything so
[37:10] well in in in in one answer it's it's an
[37:13] amazing skill that I for example don't
[37:15] don't have I I just Ramble On and you
[37:17] you really nicely packaged it um one uh
[37:21] thing that I really want to get into
[37:22] with you also is as you are in in
[37:25] education uh and Consulting also in in
[37:28] Bitcoin how do you see that uh we can
[37:32] accelerate Bitcoin adoption if you're
[37:35] like now I don't know the president of a
[37:37] country or you are in in in in some sort
[37:39] of a powerful State how can you ensure
[37:43] that uh that Bitcoin is accelerated and
[37:46] adopted faster than it is now because as
[37:49] we discussed like we we we discussed
[37:52] basically what's wrong with the system
[37:53] now we discussed like uh how great the
[37:57] system will be when Bitcoin is fully
[37:59] adopted um how can we get faster to to
[38:04] that state where it's great and and
[38:05] leave this system as fast as possible
[38:08] behind um and and yeah how do how do you
[38:12] see how yeah I think um your questions
[38:15] are very clear if I find myself in a
[38:18] position where I can easily change
[38:21] things um and how to get Bitcoin
[38:25] adoption to like every nuk andly or
[38:30] wherever I'm govering at that particular
[38:32] situation will be to intensify effort on
[38:36] creating jurisdiction Centric
[38:39] initiatives that will get Bitcoin
[38:42] education across to people um for
[38:44] instance um Telephone I think when it
[38:49] started with Alexandra gr BS he was just
[38:53] trying to like okay connect with someone
[38:55] it's is is wife or girlfriend that's at
[38:59] that time saying the word hello and what
[39:02] what that means is when
[39:05] Innovation starts from
[39:07] inception um the problems such
[39:11] Innovation soles we automatically speak
[39:15] for its adoption the only thing that
[39:18] will now be left will be time policies
[39:21] and um the the fast pce of of adopting
[39:25] such Innovation so what I can do as an
[39:28] individual who has um decision making
[39:33] power is to make sure I accelerate
[39:37] Bitcoin education through
[39:40] known perspective through known
[39:44] solutions that have worked for me as a
[39:47] Bitcoin educator so what are the
[39:49] solutions that have worked for me and
[39:51] how am I going to put them into use to
[39:54] accelerate Bitcoin education if I make
[39:56] if I'm a decision
[39:58] one creating multiple Bitcoin
[40:01] initiatives that meets people at the
[40:04] point of their needs what do I mean by
[40:07] that there are lot of people in Africa
[40:09] that don't listen to podcast they don't
[40:11] listen to Twitter spaces they don't read
[40:13] newspapers they don't listen to TVs they
[40:16] only listen to radio um there will be
[40:20] segmented program to like address such
[40:23] audience there are also some audience
[40:25] that listen to only Twitter spaces there
[40:28] will be segmented program consistent
[40:31] education program going on on radio
[40:33] stations on Twitter spaces through the
[40:37] meetups in each Community by
[40:41] creating multiple circular economies
[40:45] what do I mean by that creating making
[40:48] sure Villages as vendors that are
[40:51] willing to accept Bitcoin and um
[40:55] products available to make such
[40:57] transaction seamless for them just like
[41:01] um the case of elad where they have
[41:03] shivo wallet they have blink wallet they
[41:06] have a lot of wallet that enables
[41:07] lightning transaction and all in Africa
[41:10] we have a lot of product that enables
[41:13] that to we have bnob cashire we have
[41:16] tandle from Kenya we have um I think
[41:21] um a lot of other products I think um
[41:26] I'm I'm trying to recol one of the
[41:27] products no once as well so I'm going to
[41:30] make sure that these products are
[41:32] scalable and available for people we
[41:34] have March andura as well that you can
[41:36] actually use in remote areas so as a
[41:38] decision maker I'm going to make these
[41:40] products available for people I'm going
[41:42] to intensify efforts on education by
[41:45] making sure there are more Bitcoin
[41:47] education initiatives I'm also going to
[41:50] make sure that the works we've been
[41:52] doing in education becomes expanded not
[41:55] just on the practic level or the
[41:58] business level alone but also on the
[42:00] career level where we have University
[42:04] students SK into programs like um what
[42:08] bit trust Builder is doing what the BTC
[42:11] student network is doing what Bitcoin
[42:14] data and D is doing in training people
[42:17] and then getting them acquainted with
[42:19] this Innovation so I'm going to
[42:20] intensify effort with that so um I think
[42:24] by doing all this Bitcoin adoption will
[42:27] grow faster um the development process
[42:31] will grow better and um product will be
[42:35] more available to make transactions
[42:39] efficient and also address whatever
[42:42] problem that has been created with the
[42:46] existing traditional Finance system so
[42:48] in general my approach to expanding
[42:52] Bitcoin adoption will be making sure
[42:56] people have access to information as far
[43:00] as the technology is concerned people
[43:03] have access to products in languages or
[43:08] in ways they really understand and get
[43:10] familiar with in order to like
[43:13] transition them into using this um best
[43:16] form of money for their own good I mean
[43:20] there's always a saying that Sals
[43:22] Bitcoin or slavery so it's time to say
[43:25] oh Bitcoin and not slavery I mean
[43:29] whenever you can't control your money or
[43:32] you can't be in charge then you are
[43:35] subjected or you are subjective or you
[43:38] are literally a slave to whoever
[43:40] controls um Whoever has that power or
[43:43] control such um finances so these are
[43:48] some of the things I'm going to do if I
[43:50] end up being decision maker in terms of
[43:53] um scaling Bitcoin I will take a good
[43:56] look into um the regulatory aspect I
[43:59] will make sure there are favorable
[44:01] regulations that make sure people can
[44:04] easily use Bitcoin in my
[44:07] jurisdiction and um in Africa as large i
[44:10] l it a lot uh and uh it's so true I
[44:14] think most people don't realize that um
[44:18] when when when we have inflation that's
[44:21] stealing that's the theft that uh we
[44:23] always talking about and you you you
[44:26] nail it there
[44:27] really really cool how you how you
[44:30] phrased it also
[44:32] um when we have now the adoption rate
[44:36] where do you see Bitcoin uh in in in 20
[44:39] years do do you see that
[44:40] hyperbitcoinization
[44:42] happening uh soon or do you see Bitcoin
[44:46] have Bitcoin isation further out where
[44:49] do you see it wow um I see Bitcoin
[44:54] adoption growing heavily in the next two
[44:58] decades one Bitcoin has been built and
[45:03] developed to keep appreciating in terms
[45:06] of value against controlled Fe
[45:09] controlled currencies like that and um
[45:13] to in terms of adoption I feel people
[45:16] will get to know more about
[45:18] Bitcoin as it keeps offering more
[45:23] solutions and it keeps and it fixures
[45:27] keep expanding across different borders
[45:30] for instance few years
[45:33] back um people always want a situation
[45:38] and come up with the fact that um
[45:42] politics doesn't need politics doesn't
[45:45] need Bitcoin or Bitcoin need politics a
[45:48] lot of critics and argument around it
[45:51] but we can see situations playing out in
[45:53] different countries as nation state
[45:56] keeps adop
[45:57] Bitcoin in the space of a decade we've
[46:01] seen countries declaring Bitcoin as
[46:04] their legal tender we seen presidential
[46:07] candidates making sure they align with
[46:10] the Bitcoin net TOS in order for them to
[46:13] be able to like gain favor of the people
[46:15] that's to tell you that the Innovation
[46:18] itself has a very huge acceptance and
[46:22] the government who has been extremely
[46:24] antagonistic about the Innovation
[46:25] because of the fiction and what they
[46:28] understand is coming to Sol will is they
[46:33] are now feeling the need to like find
[46:35] alignment with the Innovation so um I
[46:39] feel it's now getting nov that um um
[46:43] politics and everything in life
[46:46] literally needs Bitcoin to St relevant
[46:50] that's like the picture being painted at
[46:53] the recent Bitcoin 2024 conference and
[46:56] if that can happen between 209 to
[47:00] 2024 talk Les what will happen in the
[47:04] space of 20 years um I think we we we
[47:09] will as a then we will be talking about
[47:11] nation state adoption more as at then
[47:14] we'll be talking about corporations um
[47:17] and entities having um Bitcoin more we
[47:22] also see the need whereby the remittance
[47:25] Solutions the basic p P options for Lay
[47:28] man on the streets will now have Bitcoin
[47:33] as their underlying technology I mean um
[47:37] Bitcoin initially has a lot of critics
[47:41] when it comes to scalability in terms of
[47:43] being a medium of exchange but within
[47:45] the space of
[47:47] few years of its um development we've
[47:53] seen awesome Layer Two Solutions like
[47:56] like the lightning coming up and
[48:00] nullifying the um
[48:03] scalability question about Bitcoin why
[48:05] bringing scalability to this Innovation
[48:08] so um this is something I believe we we
[48:12] keep seeing Improvement on on the
[48:16] technical side we will keep seeing
[48:18] Improvement on different BPS on the
[48:20] adoption side we keep seeing nation
[48:23] state adoption we keep seeing
[48:25] corporations adop in it will keep see
[48:29] individuals using the technology to
[48:31] solve their
[48:33] problems in their specific
[48:37] locations I mean Bitcoin people also
[48:40] argue you need internet connections to
[48:42] use Bitcoin people in Africa will not be
[48:44] able to use Bitcoin um the people in
[48:48] areas without network would not be able
[48:50] to use Bitcoin but in the space of
[48:53] Bitcoin um introduction by Satoshi
[48:57] and now we've seen products that are
[49:00] built dependent on bitcoin
[49:02] infrastructure that doesn't need
[49:03] internet connection for you to send
[49:05] Bitcoin across different borders I I can
[49:08] literally send Bitcoin to someone in
[49:11] South Africa right now without internet
[49:13] connection and I'm proud to tell you I'm
[49:15] going to do that with just SMS ussd
[49:19] codes cut seal of products like marchan
[49:22] Kura um I can easily send funds to you
[49:25] in United States so if that can happen
[49:27] in the space of um few years
[49:31] then much will happen in the space of
[49:35] two decades and um I
[49:39] feel events and situation of thingsam
[49:43] with Skyrocket adoption why education
[49:46] that happens to be the pillar of um
[49:49] bridging information Gap and getting
[49:52] people more aware to this Bitcoin
[49:54] Innovation will also be push towards
[49:57] adoption so I think we should stay
[49:59] optimistic we should look forward to um
[50:03] countries who are actually using Bitcoin
[50:06] as medium of exchange using Bitcoin as
[50:10] what using using Bitcoin fixures
[50:13] different fixures on bitcoin aside just
[50:16] the store of value fixures that um a lot
[50:20] of Western folks tend to like use
[50:23] Bitcoin for because man I mean as an
[50:26] European person I don't expect you to
[50:29] understand why why you won't have
[50:31] internet for two to three days or having
[50:35] eptic internet connections or having
[50:37] restriction in sending money and all of
[50:39] that so all this problem will be with
[50:43] Bitcoin adoption scaling more in the
[50:47] next two decades and um I feel there
[50:50] will be more input there will be more
[50:54] opportunities for people who tend to to
[50:56] adopt it early or who tend to like incs
[51:00] with knowledge about using this um
[51:03] Innovation perfectly so we need to look
[51:06] forward to a lot in the space of 20
[51:09] years so I see Bitcoin doing well and
[51:12] getting better I love how you describe
[51:15] things and uh it has it never came to my
[51:18] mind actually to look back and see like
[51:21] what happened in the last 14 years 15
[51:23] years and then see like what can happen
[51:26] in next 20 years now we have already
[51:28] this fundamental basis built so like
[51:33] like just the imagination of what can
[51:35] happen in in the next 20 years is is
[51:37] amazing for me to uh to see and uh yeah
[51:40] thank you already for for the podcast
[51:42] and and taking your time um before we
[51:44] end I have two more questions the first
[51:46] question is always the same question for
[51:48] every guest uh and the question for you
[51:52] is what can we learn from you besides
[51:55] Bitcoin w
[51:57] awesome I mean um can you hear me
[52:00] clearly yes I hear you perfectly yeah so
[52:03] um what you can learn from me Beyond
[52:06] Bitcoin um I think I'm going to talk
[52:08] more about myself now um I'm someone who
[52:12] is extremely optimistic and have the
[52:16] leadership spirit and um what I feel
[52:20] people can learn from me will be my life
[52:23] outside Bitcoin which is um
[52:28] my personal principles of um staying
[52:32] vocus my personal principle of serving
[52:37] as a point of contact for Progress
[52:40] making sure um you invest in Human
[52:44] Resources rather than just investing
[52:48] in um material things I mean I in 2017 I
[52:55] worked with a boss who impacted my life
[52:58] I won't hesitate to mention his name Kon
[53:00] David he made me understand that helping
[53:03] people and investing in humans is one of
[53:07] the greatest wealth you can accumulate I
[53:09] mean um um having people getting
[53:15] knowledge through you it's a leadership
[53:17] spirit that invite making sure you stay
[53:20] vocus and determined into doing things
[53:24] it's part and parel of me
[53:27] um I think I'm very young and um I
[53:32] leverage my um young age in a country
[53:37] where people feel um there's High rate
[53:40] of unemployment there's restrictions on
[53:43] financial policy I leverage my young age
[53:47] and my determination to be able to do
[53:49] things to scale myself individually so I
[53:52] literally don't listen to site talks I
[53:55] Stay vocus so everyone can actually
[53:58] learn that from me I always make sure
[54:00] people get to understand that once you
[54:03] are determined to do something
[54:05] irrespective of where you find yourself
[54:07] the time pce might just be different but
[54:10] that determination will actually make
[54:12] you achieve your goal over time um I'm a
[54:15] Christian as well so um I believe the
[54:20] spiritual controls the physical and all
[54:23] glory should also return to the cosmic
[54:26] Master that's um for me God and um Jesus
[54:31] Christ who has shown great behavior for
[54:34] me so aside Bitcoin I'm a very very
[54:37] vocus person on my on my free time I
[54:40] make sure um I dedicate my time to um
[54:46] reflect on on God's plan and decision
[54:49] for me and I stay LD as well sometimes I
[54:53] I play basketball I I I'm a gym guy so
[54:58] I'm always like at the gym and all of
[55:00] that so overall I I will urge everyone
[55:03] listening to me to stay vocus and be
[55:06] determined in whatever way they finds
[55:10] things will actually work well stay
[55:12] optimistic and don't let your
[55:15] environment or the location you find
[55:18] yourself be as a um setback for you
[55:25] leverage on every opport opportunity um
[55:27] I think let me add this I don't know
[55:29] what your last question will be um I'm
[55:34] just going to say um I think I
[55:38] also make sure I tell people this in
[55:42] Bitcoin um don't focus on the price
[55:47] always focus on the price itself which
[55:50] is Bitcoin that means um you should be
[55:53] more interested into like um
[55:56] safeguarding yourself as early adopter
[55:59] in this Innovation by accumulating more
[56:02] leveraging dollar cost aaging and
[56:06] understanding the concept of self
[56:07] custody through ownership in order for
[56:09] you to scale so these are my um
[56:12] responses to your question and I believe
[56:15] people are listening to this program
[56:17] must have been able to pick um one or
[56:20] two points from this thank you Robie
[56:23] really cool yeah I love it a lot and and
[56:25] I think s custody is such an amazing and
[56:28] and and good learning point and still a
[56:31] lot of people uh don't have self custody
[56:33] I even make a community service where
[56:37] people say no no I I don't have it in
[56:39] self custody I have it with an exchange
[56:41] on ETF or whatever so like this is still
[56:44] even in people that watch me uh and and
[56:48] tell them every day self- custody is the
[56:50] thing still people don't do it so like
[56:53] uh I think we we have to hammer this
[56:55] point down as long as possible and I
[56:58] will do that as long as As I will do it
[57:02] perfect then let's come do the last
[57:05] question of the day uh this is always
[57:07] the end routine uh of of our podcast
[57:10] where the previous guest is asking a
[57:12] question for the next guest so which is
[57:14] you um um without knowing who the next
[57:18] guest actually is and your question from
[57:20] the previous guest is what is the most
[57:23] comfortable shoe you have ever worn oh
[57:26] the most comfortable shoe I ever
[57:30] woron um yes
[57:33] wow I mean it's it's now looking like
[57:37] doing an adver for this particular
[57:39] product now but then I'm I'm just going
[57:42] to like um I think I'm I'm a fan boy of
[57:45] Nik um always but I must confess to you
[57:49] the the moment I start wearing New
[57:52] Balance I feel so comfortable on track I
[57:55] feel so comfortable go at the gym with
[57:57] it and I think new balance is taking
[58:01] more of my shoes now than n so I think
[58:04] when it comes to being comfortable in a
[58:08] particular shoe or the other I I I I
[58:10] will go for New Balance I love it a lot
[58:13] perfect then before I let you go where
