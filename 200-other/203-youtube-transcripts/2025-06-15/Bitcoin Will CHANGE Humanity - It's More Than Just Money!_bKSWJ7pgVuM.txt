[00:00] the non- bitcoiners are lazy in the
[00:02] terms of self- custodianship I'm
[00:04] convinced that Bitcoin is a good thing
[00:06] and I'm even convinced that it will be
[00:08] something very good for Humanity itself
[00:10] if you're interested in Bitcoin and
[00:12] somebody's like o I'm interested and you
[00:14] come to a 21 Meetup they pretty sure
[00:16] like five people jumping like around you
[00:19] like little GS and yeah sure sure I I
[00:22] will help you and this is kind of a very
[00:24] positive spirit I have a problem and you
[00:25] can help it's kind of a religion without
[00:27] like a leader
[00:30] [Music]
[00:33] with a lot of power comes a lot of
[00:35] responsibility with Bitcoin you can
[00:37] transact with anyone there's no one to
[00:40] stop you but you can also send it to a
[00:43] wrong address uh you can also make
[00:46] mistakes along the way you can lose your
[00:47] keys like that all those things that
[00:49] happen uh even now even though we had
[00:53] all those things in the past already um
[00:56] what will that do if that becomes more
[00:59] mainstream or will it even become
[01:01] mainstream and we just build like banks
[01:04] on top of Bitcoin and most people will
[01:06] never do the self- responsible way well
[01:10] um in just in my in my humble opinion
[01:13] and the people that I like in my bubble
[01:15] yeah like the non- bitcoiners like or
[01:17] the pre- coiners um they are lazy I
[01:21] think in the terms of uh self-
[01:24] custodianship and I get it like if you
[01:28] like if I talk with people about orange
[01:31] peeling you cannot forget uh to which
[01:34] person you're talking to and what I do
[01:36] see here is like the Austrian area uh
[01:40] the people that are new and have no idea
[01:42] about what Bitcoin could be is uh they
[01:45] are used to have a bank they're totally
[01:48] used that somebody else has the
[01:51] custodial ship about their their their
[01:53] money and even from the company
[01:57] perspective we do uh offer Bitcoin
[02:00] accepted as a solution but there on the
[02:02] other hand the other companies the
[02:05] people inside we have the same thing
[02:07] they're totally relying on that what we
[02:09] suggest and some people are like can't
[02:12] you do the whole Hardware thing stuff
[02:16] because we are used to it like we are
[02:18] used that we pay money that somebody
[02:20] else takes care of some problems so this
[02:22] I think will be we be will be a long way
[02:26] we will come there that that we that
[02:29] every person like a majority of the
[02:31] person has this self reli because I'm
[02:34] the more I'm in Bitcoin the more more
[02:35] doubtful I'm I'm getting in the
[02:37] beginning I was like oh like everyone
[02:39] will have self- custody will learn how
[02:40] to deal with keys yeah then I'm like no
[02:42] like you go to a Bitcoin conference you
[02:44] ask people uh if they do self custody
[02:47] and like 50% of the now people that are
[02:50] on bitcoin conferences they're like no
[02:52] like no I'll keep it on Exchange oh do
[02:54] this or I have some uh some other things
[02:57] or I have a multi signature solution
[03:00] where someone else has more than
[03:04] me yeah I I think this is um like the
[03:08] that's the current state we we need to
[03:10] deal with and as I'm by the way I'm I'm
[03:13] convinced that Bitcoin is a good thing
[03:15] and I'm even convinced that it will be
[03:17] something something greater or something
[03:20] very good for Humanity itself because
[03:22] for all what it stands for um so like
[03:26] you should never get tired about like
[03:29] talking people people to yeah but if you
[03:31] at an exchange yeah how about having
[03:35] your old wallet and even if it's I don't
[03:37] know uh uh like these plastic card
[03:40] wallets even these is is better you know
[03:42] when you need to scratch off the the
[03:44] private key even this has kind of like
[03:47] the touch of self custodianship and this
[03:49] Rush of adrenaline like okay I really
[03:52] have it now in my
[03:54] hands and um yeah absolutely that's
[03:58] that's interesting what do you think it
[04:00] will change in the world as you
[04:01] mentioned it what change in the world um
[04:05] first of all
[04:06] [Music]
[04:07] um I think the Bitcoin bubble
[04:11] is it brings a lot of people together
[04:14] who want to change something and um
[04:17] there's like a lot of I think we we
[04:19] austrians have a culture of complaining
[04:21] a lot like this is [ __ ] and this is bad
[04:23] and uh a lot of finger pointing um it's
[04:27] fine people can be that way uh I like to
[04:29] deal more with people that go to the
[04:31] next step it's like okay this is [ __ ]
[04:33] what can we do change what do we want to
[04:36] change and even like changing um uh the
[04:39] perspective of storing your value um
[04:43] like also Bitcoin on a technical level
[04:46] what you can also do like for transfer
[04:48] value it enables the people like to be
[04:51] more creative and to don't be powerless
[04:54] in in the other hand there are so many
[04:56] like topics and talking that people can
[04:59] actually do something okay I know this
[05:01] is very abstract but to be very Concrete
[05:04] in our company we need new pullovers
[05:07] with our logo on it because we like that
[05:10] and on the Bitcoin C last year we we met
[05:14] like um Nakamoto Stitch a person who
[05:17] actually offers this and he wants to do
[05:19] like get out of the the feat World more
[05:22] into the Bitcoin world and he's trying
[05:23] his new thing and this is kind of like
[05:26] more more livelihood you know more
[05:30] yeah more being alive more trying to do
[05:32] something else out of your world and I
[05:34] think sometimes if you are working in
[05:36] the
[05:37] traditional hierle like business world
[05:41] you are kind of bordered and if you're
[05:43] stepping into the other world into the
[05:45] Bitcoin world where you suddenly can can
[05:47] try stuff and you have a lot of support
[05:49] of people who are thinking freely and
[05:50] like yeah why not try it and maybe you
[05:53] get advice from from people too you're
[05:55] not
[05:56] alone there's something I think it's
[05:58] changing you know it's like you don't
[06:00] need to have like this these paths you
[06:03] can try to create something new yeah I
[06:07] love that and it's I mean to a certain
[06:09] extent I feel like we we we do have a
[06:12] very cured uh list of friends and people
[06:16] that we hang out to and then it's like
[06:18] really interesting when you step out of
[06:20] the maybe you have a big family and you
[06:22] talk with people uh in in your family
[06:25] that aren't close to the Bitcoin
[06:28] Community it's really interesting to see
[06:29] the difference there or like you talk
[06:31] with friends that you haven't met for
[06:33] years and you're like oh like oh whole
[06:35] different mindset whole different world
[06:38] so I I do hope that that changing
[06:41] narrative that we have now in Bitcoin
[06:43] also really translates in the world the
[06:45] more Bitcoin spreads and not just like
[06:48] to the early adopted group because early
[06:49] adopted groups are usually um way more
[06:53] uh let's say Cooperative they are way
[06:55] more risk-taking they are way more um
[06:58] all those things that we associate with
[07:00] bitcoiners so I'm I'm always questioning
[07:03] like is is is Bitcoin changing something
[07:05] or are we thinking that Bitcoin change
[07:07] something because uh we are in this
[07:10] early adopted group and we think the the
[07:13] this Bitcoin group right now is so
[07:15] different to the rest of the world
[07:17] obviously because you have to be you
[07:20] have to have an ego def once you get to
[07:22] bitcoin because usually you saw it at
[07:24] like T of the price before and you
[07:27] thought it's a scam like we go usually
[07:29] for the steps uh then you have to
[07:31] research it then you might lose it if
[07:33] you don't take care of it uh even if you
[07:35] have it an exchange you might lose it
[07:37] because there so many exchanges going
[07:39] going bust in in the last 10 15 years of
[07:42] Bitcoin so there's a lot of humbling uh
[07:45] experiences there's a lot of steps you
[07:48] get towards if you now since like years
[07:51] a humbling bitcoiner stacking SS uh you
[07:54] have a lot of the same experiences with
[07:56] other
[07:57] ones but what if uh the whole world
[08:00] comes into that and that's why I'm like
[08:02] okay what what what will Bitcoin
[08:03] actually change and I'm not settled on
[08:06] what it will be that's why I'm so
[08:07] interested in what people think about
[08:10] that really cool
[08:14] uh I totally agree so I you know I I
[08:17] cannot argue or discuss with you this
[08:19] because I I totally agree there's this
[08:21] part of uh hum Humanity I would call it
[08:26] like being a a human and uh like help
[08:29] each other because it doesn't matter
[08:33] like what what job you do it doesn't
[08:35] matter what what education you have if
[08:38] you're interested in Bitcoin and
[08:39] somebody's like o o oo I'm interested
[08:43] like and you come to a 21 Meetup they're
[08:45] pretty sure like five people jumping
[08:47] like around you like um like little GS
[08:50] it's like yeah sure sure I I will help
[08:52] you you know and this is kind of like a
[08:55] a a very like positive spirit like I
[08:58] have a problem and you get helped yeah
[09:00] you get helped and this is
[09:02] so I think basic you know basic somebody
[09:06] has a problem and another human being is
[09:07] like yeah okay cool yeah we can do
[09:09] something or you get if it's Tech
[09:11] technically like too deep okay you maybe
[09:13] get related to another person and this
[09:17] is kind of like a from a human point of
[09:20] view like uh a good thing about Bitcoin
[09:24] it brings people together because
[09:26] somehow we are looking in kind of the
[09:29] same Direction but what direction it is
[09:31] or what the end goal will be nobody can
[09:34] know for sure yeah but it's better like
[09:37] than we we are right now right here
[09:40] absolutely I do agree with that um I saw
[09:44] that 100K and I thought like 100k will
[09:47] be a huge stepping stone for Bitcoin and
[09:49] I was kind of disappointed from the the
[09:53] outside of Bitcoin world of the reaction
[09:55] how did you how did you see the the this
[09:58] huge milestone that reached a few months
[10:00] ago honestly I have
[10:03] not given much thought about it of
[10:06] course you know if you have um an AM
[10:10] amount of your like life savings in
[10:13] Bitcoin of course if it increases in
[10:16] value I think everybody has like kind of
[10:18] this feeling okay I made a good
[10:21] investment or this was good um but I try
[10:26] not to think about it it goes up and
[10:28] down and is like daily looking I did it
[10:31] it doesn't make you really happy it
[10:32] makes you more me at least me did more
[10:34] more nervous and everything um so if
[10:37] Bitcoin hit the 100,000k mark I was like
[10:41] okay it seems like the the whole
[10:44] research that I did and the talking to
[10:46] people that I trust that how they
[10:49] explain Bitcoin to me it kind of comes
[10:53] to like comes to no like it's getting
[10:57] true you know it's that what they said
[11:00] it's becoming the future and the then
[11:02] the future is 100k and so on but it's
[11:04] also the news that I read you know what
[11:06] is going on on the
[11:08] US even um I don't have an opinion on
[11:12] Trump but that he's like Pro Bitcoin and
[11:15] everything um that in um I think Canada
[11:19] uh in Vancouver they're like Pro Bitcoin
[11:21] are thinking about something doing
[11:22] something is so these are all like
[11:25] directions where like okay more and more
[11:27] people thinking about it and
[11:29] and yeah the market is reacting to that
[11:33] so of course it's going up but in which
[11:36] time frame or up and down I don't I
[11:39] don't care and I honestly I try not to
[11:41] care as good as possible because of
[11:44] course yeah yeah it's it's totally
[11:48] understandable but what I was shocked
[11:50] about is how less because the the prize
[11:54] is usually the best marketing tool for
[11:57] people outside of Bitcoin that's that's
[11:58] what the usually know about Bitcoin
[12:00] that's that's where the information of
[12:03] Bitcoin starts and ends with with people
[12:06] outside of of Bitcoin with the price and
[12:08] maybe they know some small facts around
[12:10] it um so I thought uh outside of the
[12:14] Bitcoin Community it will have a way
[12:16] bigger impact it will be a way bigger
[12:19] event for no
[12:21] coiners a little bit like maybe 2017
[12:24] where all of the sudden a lot of um Talk
[12:28] was around Bitcoin way more than it is
[12:31] now you can also see that with the
[12:33] Google Trends uh is is like we're like
[12:36] halfway there maybe I can pull it up
[12:38] later but I think we are halfway there
[12:40] from 2017 levels which is crazy because
[12:43] we're now more than 5x higher um is is
[12:46] the is the general public like like what
[12:49] what price need do we need to hit that
[12:52] the general public is like oh like oh
[12:53] it's like now it's like at 200,000 um
[12:57] the same kind of level that we had in in
[13:00] 20177 to be honest I I don't think these
[13:03] are discussions that I that I have or
[13:05] that I want to have because if I have
[13:08] I'm mostly into the technology so like
[13:11] Glo global economy and this stuff I'm
[13:15] like blank you know discussions kind of
[13:18] like okay I just can't believe you
[13:21] because I have not much knowledge there
[13:23] so let's let's imagine I'm like at the
[13:25] family table table or friends table and
[13:28] somebody comes out like hey and like you
[13:30] got Bitcoin so now you must have like
[13:32] rich or something I normally block this
[13:36] conversation with really I don't know I
[13:40] didn't care you know I I see others it's
[13:43] for me like a long store of value so it
[13:46] can go up and it can go down and that's
[13:48] where I normally leave the uh the
[13:51] conversation but what's interesting what
[13:54] what I'm interested is if if I'm talking
[13:56] to the other person are you interested
[13:58] in doing something you know like how do
[14:01] you see Bitcoin that's where like I want
[14:03] to put my effort in be yeah that's where
[14:06] I want to put my effort actually
[14:08] interesting what do you think is the
[14:10] most important thing in in the in the
[14:12] starting with talking to someone to
[14:15] educate them about Bitcoin like uh there
[14:17] are so many different Avenues you can
[14:19] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um for me it's
[14:25] like uh I I taught a lot different stuff
[14:28] and the one thing that for me repeats is
[14:31] getting people into action so if
[14:34] somebody is like on the edge trying to
[14:36] do something with Bitcoin I normally do
[14:39] the offer um do you want to try a a
[14:42] regular uh Savings Plan you know and
[14:46] people are like should I do that and
[14:49] what's about the risk and everything and
[14:52] what I normally do is just for an
[14:54] example a friend like okay he's interest
[14:56] and is like okay how about like € month
[14:59] for a year that's like
[15:01] €120 um how about you getting started
[15:04] like with Bitcoin and and everything and
[15:07] people normally block because they say
[15:09] yeah it's the risk and I'm not sure what
[15:12] if the money is gone I normally do them
[15:14] a onetime offers like yeah like okay
[15:17] let's let's note the date you do the
[15:19] savings plan and I will ask you one year
[15:21] later if I should buy the Bitcoin back
[15:24] about um the amount that it um not anov
[15:28] price the the cost of basic the average
[15:32] entry price I don't know how it's called
[15:34] like I I will buy it back that's what
[15:36] they bought so I I taking them the risk
[15:39] compl complete out of the equation and
[15:41] normally they like Okay so this means
[15:44] you're giving me savings plan where
[15:45] after a year I can get like my money
[15:49] back and there is like no risk for me at
[15:51] all so you have all the
[15:53] risk and then you know I normally do say
[15:55] nothing you know it's like yeah that's
[15:58] what I think about Bitcoin because €120
[16:01] is a risk you know that I can take you
[16:03] know maybe it's like um
[16:05] €1,200 where I'm like okay um but in the
[16:10] end you know I do stack SS and here at
[16:14] this point it's just you know a
[16:16] calculation my end when I like buy €
[16:20] 1,200 like in Bitcoin and helping at the
[16:23] same time another
[16:25] person I did this several times and all
[16:28] kept their Bitcoin it's it's so it's
[16:31] more about not teaching them about
[16:33] Bitcoin but more like getting their feed
[16:36] wet into Bitcoin and letting them
[16:38] explore Bitcoin from there because if
[16:39] they have exposure it's easy for them
[16:41] yeah bring people into doing like of
[16:43] course talk with them like my my major
[16:46] one point is like uh it's inflation
[16:49] proof yeah and the rest of the market I
[16:53] don't really get but that's why it's
[16:55] going up and down and uh yeah the whole
[16:59] technical side I can tell I have the
[17:02] good thing is I'm in grat so I have a
[17:03] Bitcoin broker where people actually can
[17:06] go there with their passport you know
[17:08] and have somebody there counter where
[17:11] they can buy the Bitcoin and don't do it
[17:13] online and uh yeah that's basically this
[17:16] and I cover the the risk which is not a
[17:19] risk for
[17:20] me wait you can uh is it an ATM or like
[17:24] an actual desk uh coinfinity has an
[17:27] actual desk where you can walk into like
[17:30] an a front office like where you can can
[17:33] buy and trade oh I didn't do that
[17:35] actually I mean of course I know about
[17:38] coin Infinity but I was not aware that
[17:39] you can actually go physically there and
[17:42] and buy Bitcoin interesting yeah if you
[17:44] think uh about like the elderly
[17:47] generation I hope you can say it that
[17:49] way um that are like not so in the
[17:52] digital realm they go there and they
[17:55] have a number to call and they have a
[17:58] person that they can talk to and this is
[18:00] important and normally these people also
[18:02] have like savings you
[18:05] know yeah interesting oh man I I talked
[18:10] to an elderly couple in C and this would
[18:13] have been the perfect solution for them
[18:15] interesting yeah
[18:18] uh I have to think about that next time
[18:20] maybe I tell them later uh we stop
[18:23] recording that's that's really cool um
[18:24] do you remember how how you came into
[18:27] Bitcoin and how how you came across that
[18:29] thing of like um because we have an end
[18:32] tetin and I think it fits in here really
[18:34] nicely so we we do it a little bit
[18:37] before that the ending question today is
[18:39] like what did you come to bitcoin for
[18:41] and why did you stay and I I really want
[18:44] to get that entertain question today a
[18:46] little bit earlier and so sure what did
[18:48] you come for bit to bitcoin for and and
[18:50] why did you stay why did I come I
[18:53] accidentally stumbled on bitcoin because
[18:56] I have a major in game design and game
[18:58] devel velopment and I saw um block GI
[19:02] chain games on the binance chain and I
[19:04] was partly as a developer and from the
[19:07] game system I was
[19:10] interested um and asked like a friend
[19:13] from volleyball who I knew had like a
[19:17] lot of knowledge about cryptocurrencies
[19:19] I did not know that he was like a pure
[19:22] bitcoiner at that time but he took the
[19:25] time and you know explained stuff then I
[19:27] like traded
[19:30] 50 tried these things and um yeah then I
[19:37] you know I tried these games and all
[19:39] what I what I saw there was basically
[19:43] how the players and there is a system
[19:46] where the players could inflate the the
[19:48] money that's in the game yeah even if
[19:50] it's a [ __ ] token they could inflate the
[19:52] thing so the late the later you could
[19:56] the later you entered that game uh the
[19:58] less money you could get out of the game
[20:01] so this was a cycle that kind of
[20:03] continued like every game crashed after
[20:05] three or four months because some
[20:07] players knew how to withdraw the whole
[20:10] value of that system and so that the the
[20:12] token that they were working was getting
[20:14] worthless at some point and I was
[20:16] reading in the developer blocks where
[20:18] they like yeah they're like trying to
[20:20] balance the things out and this is like
[20:22] some were complaining some were of
[20:25] course like this is like um snowball
[20:28] scheme and blah blah blah and everything
[20:30] but I was more on the game perspective
[20:33] nobody could solve this yeah nobody
[20:35] could solve this kind of like if you
[20:37] don't have new players bringing like new
[20:39] money into the system and others you
[20:41] know trying to withdraw like on on a
[20:43] regular basis the money it wouldn't work
[20:46] and that's where like with my beach
[20:48] volleyball colleague I started like
[20:51] talking more and more and more about
[20:53] Bitcoin and was he was raising the flag
[20:56] about inflation
[20:59] and basically then I was hooked I talked
[21:01] with him and then we founded the company
[21:04] together and that was uh what do you're
[21:06] doing now in in in Bitcoin with satosi
[21:09] engineering um now we
[21:12] are we are focusing on like it um IT
[21:17] services it development for Bitcoin
[21:20] related projects but what we noticed is
[21:24] we cannot U do this the the the fulltime
[21:27] so we are also taking projects which are
[21:29] not Bitcoin related and if we have
[21:32] nothing to work on we are trying to
[21:35] build stuff for the community so we have
[21:38] uh the lightning tip cards which is a an
[21:41] orange peeling
[21:42] Tool uh people can use because you can
[21:46] um load it up with with sets and you can
[21:49] give it to a nocoiner and it has
[21:51] basically um a
[21:53] small um UNL no instruction thank you a
[21:59] small instruction manual how like what
[22:01] is bitcoin how you can withdraw it from
[22:03] the card and you get a pretty easy start
[22:05] from wallet of Satoshi is that is that
[22:08] the lightning tip Cuts yeah this yeah
[22:11] basically this is the lightning tip
[22:12] cards and it was the basic idea you know
[22:15] we are at the restaurant we want to tip
[22:17] the waiter in in SATs but we they don't
[22:20] have the time you know um
[22:23] to um they don't have the time that we
[22:27] can explain what tip uh what Bitcoin is
[22:29] but you know you have these prepared
[22:31] cards you give it them like for Five for
[22:34] 10 years in worth and then you know
[22:37] maybe it's enough attention for them you
[22:38] know to start with Bitcoin and if they
[22:42] don't withdraw okay then you withdraw
[22:45] the the the SS back and try it with the
[22:48] next waiter you know I love that idea of
[22:52] of tipping waiters uh uh because they're
[22:55] kind of the the the the most Grassroots
[22:59] spreaders of information out uh because
[23:03] everyone goes to restaurants like I I I
[23:06] didn't meet any single person yet that
[23:08] was never at a restaurant and usually
[23:10] most people go on a regular basis with
[23:12] friends with partners with whatever H
[23:15] and there's always a waiter that talks
[23:17] to you so absolutely if we orange fill
[23:18] all the waiters we won the game yeah
[23:21] yeah absolutely yeah true true true uh
[23:24] but uh it seems like that the community
[23:26] uses the tip cards also for for
[23:28] different use cases the Bitcoin Block in
[23:30] Munich they use these QR codes on custom
[23:34] Flyers so that they can hand out flyers
[23:37] um to people that are like stopping by
[23:40] it's like hey you want to buy a coffee
[23:42] in in tip car because they have a whole
[23:44] lightning Community like lightning
[23:46] payment infrastructure there but via the
[23:49] tip Car Technology they get uh the SATs
[23:52] on a wall of Satoshi and then they can
[23:54] buy their their um uh their coffee and
[23:58] this is again like a point uh I made
[24:01] before bring people to use it you know
[24:05] like if somebody has a wallet of Satoshi
[24:07] and can pay a coffee with that I think
[24:11] in my observation people are like oh
[24:13] that's that's easy really I thought
[24:16] Bitcoin is more difficult boy it's like
[24:18] it's like that you know people are like
[24:20] mind blown that it's so easy because
[24:22] they have actually no clue you know
[24:25] because there is no Bank there is not
[24:28] you know
[24:29] nothing tangible yeah all changes once
[24:32] you get to use it I actually had even
[24:36] last year a huge breakthrough because I
[24:38] was never paid in Bitcoin and I was
[24:41] never paying anything really in Bitcoin
[24:43] except like lightning like a small drink
[24:46] or something like that on in a in a
[24:48] conference but last year uh with the
[24:51] Bitcoin podcast I got sponsors that are
[24:53] also Bitcoin companies so uh at first I
[24:57] was so in my Fe mind said to like oh
[24:59] like let's let's set the payment system
[25:00] out what do you need like what numbers
[25:03] do you need and for example coin vilante
[25:05] they are American company it's kind of
[25:08] complicated from America to Europe you
[25:10] need some how is it called a numbers or
[25:13] something like that and then I was like
[25:16] H why don't we just do it in Bitcoin
[25:18] like is is that possible I was like
[25:20] checking with my account and I was like
[25:21] can I do it and like of course uh just
[25:24] uh the unit of count has to be Euros but
[25:27] that's easy the uh on the invoice there
[25:30] super easy tools like sepide and a lot
[25:32] of other tools that you can use to
[25:34] facilitate that I basically set it up in
[25:37] like half an hour like maybe 45 minutes
[25:41] uh sent the link and after 10 minutes he
[25:44] paid and it was a Sunday afternoon yeah
[25:47] it was super easy and now it's it's like
[25:49] and with all my uh sponsors except one
[25:52] uh I I do the Bitcoin payments and once
[25:56] you experience that like this payment
[25:59] comes from America it comes directly to
[26:01] my self custody wallet there's no bank
[26:04] to bank to bank then from the bank to
[26:06] exchange from The Exchange to the self
[26:07] custody setup so like yeah just like the
[26:10] and that's that was a mind blown for me
[26:12] even though I was fully orange buil once
[26:14] you experience it it's a I I totally
[26:17] agree uh the part of being I I guess
[26:20] you're self-employed right yeah
[26:22] absolutely yeah so you're self-employed
[26:24] so you you doing an your accounting or
[26:26] somebody else but you have an idea of
[26:28] your accounting
[26:30] um this is like I I love that you
[26:34] stumbled the over that but it's not it's
[26:38] not magic it's not rocket science it's
[26:40] just talk one time with your accountant
[26:43] or explain it one time to accountant
[26:46] what it is or like our accountant had to
[26:49] educate uh his company because we were
[26:52] like okay and now we are also receiving
[26:54] funds in Bitcoin and we have an like a
[26:57] Bitcoin B bank account yeah we don't
[27:00] have like a like um um like an online
[27:04] banking app so we are doing the things
[27:06] by ourselves but as long as it's like a
[27:09] beautiful looking PDF you know our
[27:11] accountant is happy you know he doesn't
[27:13] need like like details like like what's
[27:18] the utxo and where are things lying
[27:20] around no they need to do like their
[27:22] stuff they have like we are like under
[27:25] the Austrian law so that's the
[27:27] regulation we working with and it's
[27:30] possible and you know this is for me
[27:32] like the next step like telling people
[27:35] also like on on the business side
[27:37] Bitcoin is no rocket science in your
[27:39] company yeah or being self-employed just
[27:42] do it there there is no much I partnered
[27:45] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[27:48] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[27:51] saw created by anyone look at that
[27:54] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[27:57] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[28:00] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[28:03] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[28:06] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[28:09] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[28:12] new and amazing Genesis edition of their

[28:35] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[28:38] love those watches so so much if you
[28:41] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[28:43] regular basis I guess you already bought
[28:46] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[28:48] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[28:52] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[28:54] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[28:56] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[28:59] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[29:01] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[29:04] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[29:07] with the code Robin at the checkout
[29:09] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[29:13] your bitbox and the next step is to
[29:16] really level up your sovereignty as an
[29:18] individual you have to have the most
[29:21] secure self custody setup you have to
[29:23] secure your own devices you have to
[29:26] protect your privacy you have to set up
[29:29] an inheritance plan and depending on
[29:31] where you live you even want to have a
[29:34] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[29:37] in case something goes really really
[29:38] wrong and through all those steps the
[29:40] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[29:43] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[29:46] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[29:50] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[29:53] how you can level up your sovereignty
[29:55] yeah absolutely that's that's that's a
[29:58] wonderful inside um by way do you think
[30:01] that lightning will be number one for
[30:03] Layer Two honestly I have no clue like
[30:06] of course we are have our eyes open kind
[30:09] of for everything yeah so we are like
[30:13] kind of it looks promising like what
[30:16] liquid is now getting for a push forward
[30:19] uh but in the end you know it's I think
[30:21] it's a mix between what will be offered
[30:25] like where can I pay with yeah and what
[30:27] is established and lightning also with
[30:30] with uh like in the background with the
[30:33] the the ecash or cashier what's going
[30:36] there they already have a strong
[30:39] um establishment yeah they they're known
[30:42] it's working like every Bitcoin cadel I
[30:45] think is all everything running on
[30:47] Lightning but let's see what there will
[30:49] be uh in the future um and one thing I
[30:53] like about the Bitcoin community that
[30:55] it's kind of a a friendly
[30:58] fin um friendly competition thank you a
[31:01] friendly competition because I could
[31:04] name like three companies who are like
[31:07] competitors uh like in the Bitcoin realm
[31:10] that's what we do but when we talk with
[31:12] them at Citadel or like at the PTC prct
[31:15] last year it's normally more like how do
[31:17] you do this how do you solve like this
[31:20] regulatory problem or how do you do that
[31:23] it's not so like okay uh like um you
[31:27] getting like the suspicious eye because
[31:29] you're trying to get like company
[31:30] Secrets it's more like okay how you
[31:32] doing this how you solving this and okay
[31:34] maybe we can work together probably not
[31:36] because it's the same business but in
[31:39] the end we're both bitcoiners and that's
[31:41] also what I like yeah I I I love that
[31:44] and probably it's mostly because it's
[31:47] such a fast expanding Market uh like if
[31:51] you look at the hardare wallet market
[31:54] for example most bitcoiners don't have a
[31:57] hardare wallet so uh are you are you
[32:01] sure yeah absolutely like if you look at
[32:05] uh not like if we look at conferences
[32:08] there's probably like I don't know like
[32:09] 50 60% of the people maybe have a hard
[32:13] wallet it a bit consider probably 100%
[32:15] that that's a different kind of a
[32:17] conference but I was at Abu Dhabi whole
[32:20] different Bitcoin world and there on the
[32:23] main stage there were like 8,000 people
[32:25] in total there on the main stage with
[32:27] like 4,000 people in there okay who has
[32:30] the coins uh on an exchange 50% uh uh
[32:36] put the hands up like who does not have
[32:38] self- custody something like that was
[32:39] the question and I ask around and a lot
[32:42] of people don't have self- custody and
[32:44] treasur made some market research they
[32:47] are saying that when we account for
[32:50] everyone that has somewhere Bitcoin like
[32:53] on Exchange or like on some you can even
[32:56] like cash app in America you can have
[32:58] Bitcoin and stuff like that and you
[33:00] account for everyone there's maybe like
[33:03] a a 3% or 4% uh adoption rate of
[33:06] Hardware wallets and self- custody in
[33:09] that sense Hardware wallets it was not
[33:11] not self- custody it was really like how
[33:13] many have a hard wallet so I'm like the
[33:17] the market for Hardware wallet
[33:19] manufacturers is the biggest one to CB
[33:21] for those who don't even know about hard
[33:23] wallets not the oh why is my hard wallet
[33:27] why is it treasure than or than a bitx
[33:30] it's more about like getting to those
[33:32] people that don't know any of those yeah
[33:35] uh but yeah the point that I wanted to
[33:37] make is because we're living in such an
[33:40] fast expanding Market I think a
[33:43] competition is kind of let's let's help
[33:45] each other I don't know and podcasters
[33:48] don't don't really have competition to
[33:49] each other uh but for example I talk a
[33:52] lot with rogard Sony we have like every
[33:54] few months we're just talking of like I
[33:57] show him my analytics he shows me your
[33:59] his analytics share like what we've
[34:01] learned last months how we can grow
[34:03] faster and expand the Bitcoin message
[34:06] out there on YouTube better and you
[34:09] could say he's a competitor of mine
[34:11] because he also does YouTube videos but
[34:13] we don't see that way we want to grow
[34:15] together we want to build like we are
[34:17] digital soldiers on the
[34:19] Bitcoin and and we are fighting a war
[34:22] against fear and not against each other
[34:24] so yeah that way I we are a big
[34:26] community and we work for the same
[34:29] company yeah or or even yeah or the same
[34:32] vision I think that what kind of is
[34:35] unique that most of the bitcoiners even
[34:37] if they maybe they don't know some I
[34:39] think they don't know but they're kind
[34:41] of investing their time or the energy I
[34:43] wouldn't say they are fighting yeah I
[34:45] would say they invest their time and
[34:47] their energy for a better future and
[34:51] whatever that is and I think some really
[34:53] are enjoying this okay this passion and
[34:57] we can move something we can do
[34:59] something even if it's just you know
[35:00] talking and like you talking with your
[35:03] competitor and comparing and like see
[35:06] what what's working this is like from
[35:08] from a company perspective you know
[35:10] that's what you should do you should
[35:11] like question what you do and re re
[35:14] reviewing and changing maybe something
[35:17] that's what we do too yeah that's great
[35:20] and even greater if you have somebody in
[35:22] the same field as you um okay it's not
[35:25] the colleag it's not the same company
[35:26] but it's under the same hood of the
[35:28] vision that Bitcoin is something useful
[35:32] and this is kind of the magic bringing
[35:34] kind of like competitors
[35:36] together and this is uh super
[35:39] interesting I was before in in it
[35:42] security job before I came into Bitcoin
[35:44] and and also account manager and some
[35:46] well at booths and stuff like that where
[35:48] we know which persons came to that
[35:50] conference and we're like okay like
[35:52] those people trying to do the same thing
[35:54] let's not talk too much to them uh and
[35:57] those are potential customers let's talk
[35:59] more to them so that mindset
[36:02] is I don't know if it's understandable
[36:04] but it's like in the feeld world and in
[36:06] Bitcoin is totally different when I go
[36:08] to conferences this this collaboration
[36:10] aspect is a whole different thing abut I
[36:12] love that it's uh more protective and I
[36:15] I think it's uh like a business thinking
[36:19] of the 1920s you know uh like very
[36:24] strong Hier Hier h
[36:28] you know what I'm trying to say yeah
[36:29] thank you I Rec thinking yeah thank you
[36:32] um and you know I don't know how long
[36:35] but this was like how the business world
[36:37] was running and is still running like
[36:39] the Western world like for 50 60 70
[36:42] years and that's fine and people are I
[36:46] think either sick of it and if they're
[36:48] not sick of it I think they don't
[36:50] have uh the emotional capacity you know
[36:54] like to to go on that path because in
[36:57] end it burns the people out because you
[36:59] you have too less I don't know
[37:01] excitement or passion yeah like before I
[37:05] like I had the IT company uh I was in
[37:08] team and organizational development like
[37:10] in the whole agile bubble yeah so
[37:13] teaching people about like different
[37:14] styles of project management and working
[37:17] together and it was my whole like at
[37:19] least from the T that was the the vibe
[37:23] that I got and this is also What
[37:24] attracted me to bitcoin that people who
[37:28] are still like in the Fiat world and we
[37:30] all have like um a life we we we want to
[37:33] afford and this means like we need to
[37:35] earn money at some point but we also
[37:38] want to change something and we maybe
[37:40] want to change switch like our like
[37:44] value storage to bitcoin and maybe also
[37:47] our like working style or working life
[37:49] yeah so this kind of like it goes hun in
[37:53] Hunt like holding hands together that's
[37:55] what I what I see and that's also with
[37:57] the
[37:58] the small I don't know the small
[38:01] bitcoiners that we pay invoices to you
[38:04] know like making the hoodies yeah uh
[38:08] making flyers or business cards
[38:11] yeah absolutely that that that's amazing
[38:14] to to see um really cool what do you
[38:17] think is the biggest challenge that
[38:20] comes our way for Bitcoin adoption bit
[38:23] Bitcoin education in the in the future
[38:26] um
[38:28] yeah currently primed because I had uh
[38:32] withes Bank like with a banking employee
[38:35] like of a major Bank in Gs and he had
[38:39] like the the real good question why do
[38:41] we need Banks yeah because um banks have
[38:45] a history uh he explained like why are
[38:49] they are so scared or so so really like
[38:53] f uh
[38:55] about um doing anything with crypto yeah
[38:58] because it seems like they have also
[39:00] like a history that's not nice not the
[39:03] point uh the point
[39:05] is we as an Austrian company we cannot
[39:09] hold Bitcoin for other um companies so
[39:12] we cannot do the custodianship because
[39:14] we are three people and we don't want
[39:17] the banking license we don't have like
[39:19] the the regulation um part of the
[39:22] Austrian government like monitoring us
[39:25] this is way too much effort so for us
[39:27] the thing is like we need a custodian
[39:30] for our customers so we do the Technical
[39:32] Solutions but still we need custodians
[39:35] and it seems like Banks won't be that
[39:38] but
[39:39] um I I'm not very sure like about the
[39:43] Austrian law but if we help you know the
[39:46] Grassroots movement for example um like
[39:51] the the IT guy who is like interested in
[39:54] Bitcoin and he is playing you know the
[39:57] custodian on the private sector for his
[40:00] his for his bubble for his community for
[40:02] his people I think this is like this
[40:05] could be a way to go and these people
[40:07] need to be like I don't know
[40:12] um they they need to be I mean empowered
[40:16] like substitute like and yeah Empower
[40:20] definitely they need to have uh the the
[40:23] right Tools in their hands for that yeah
[40:24] the the right tools uh and also like uh
[40:28] the like uh what does it mean legally
[40:30] like what can they do what's kind of
[40:32] like okay because do we need Banks this
[40:37] is not a question where the goal should
[40:39] be no uh Banks should eliminated this is
[40:41] just a qu question what is the next you
[40:43] know evolvement of this you know and I
[40:47] personally think because we are
[40:48] searching for custodians maybe it's
[40:51] going back you know that there are like
[40:53] a lot of small custodians taking also
[40:56] like the the
[40:58] or the the technical stuff and
[41:00] everything you know like for their
[41:02] bubble and then there's the next bubble
[41:04] and then there's the next bubble so it's
[41:06] kind of like a lot of like mini Banks
[41:08] you know growing up on on a private
[41:11] sector yeah yeah it's it's almost like
[41:14] when you are when you're a bitcoiner an
[41:16] early bitcoiner who has some some
[41:19] Bitcoin you can provide the liquidity
[41:21] you can be like a um a bank for your
[41:25] region for your community I talked about
[41:27] that topic actually like a few times
[41:29] already and I think it's a really
[41:31] interesting concept when we when we
[41:33] think about that that uh banks are way
[41:37] more regionalized way more smaller way
[41:40] more uh yeah way more customizable and
[41:44] personalized and maybe for small
[41:46] communities uh it's it's it's
[41:48] interesting that a a global uh
[41:50] settlement layer that is for the whole
[41:53] world is kind of making us uh more
[41:55] connected in small communi is you you
[41:58] almost thought like this this could be
[42:00] it's an interesting how it goes for for
[42:02] that yeah like in my local 21 Community
[42:06] here in in sta um I like with some like
[42:11] Tech it um like let's say like
[42:14] programmers or it people who like know
[42:16] their stuff it's still you know an
[42:18] effort to run your lightning note it's
[42:19] still an effort to have
[42:22] um uh the channel management of
[42:24] lightning you know even if you use now
[42:27] um some some promising tools where these
[42:30] things are like automatically hosted uh
[42:34] I looked at get Ali like their new
[42:36] Evolution um it looks pretty nice and
[42:39] pretty simple but still you know you
[42:41] need to do all that stuff yeah and how
[42:45] do you do how do you get this accounting
[42:47] layer like for your mom for your dad for
[42:49] your cousin's friend you know the friend
[42:51] of a friend of a friend you know so I'm
[42:55] kind of like um missing the solution
[42:57] yeah and nothing better if it's from a
[43:01] company perspective if a company comes
[43:03] like to us and like okay and uh you want
[43:06] to accept Bitcoin perfectly we help you
[43:08] with everything but where do you want to
[43:11] store your Bitcoin in lightning but
[43:13] because you need these two and there's
[43:15] like no no worries we have somebody you
[43:17] know we have somebody in the company
[43:18] okay fine that's you know what I need
[43:21] because then we as a company we're not
[43:24] the custodian we can't we currently we
[43:26] cannot be yeah
[43:28] may maybe that's the uh that's the
[43:30] beginning of Bitcoin cadelas like re
[43:33] like real Bitcoin Citadel where we we
[43:35] are commun where we organizing itself in
[43:38] in smaller uh Regional groups and
[43:41] smaller Regional uh not departments or
[43:45] like smaller Regional groups and towns
[43:48] uh and building those Bitcoin citadels
[43:50] for the for the future um and I mean the
[43:54] I think the German community is really
[43:56] unique in that we have the 21 group uh
[43:59] that has so many meetups it's it's crazy
[44:02] and it's act because I speak with all
[44:05] people all over the world from America
[44:07] from Africa and all over the world that
[44:09] what we have in Germany is pretty unique
[44:11] where the an German speaking area where
[44:15] the political level seems to not get it
[44:19] yet real thing but we have so much
[44:22] Grassroots movement so much uh
[44:25] Grassroots movement from all all the
[44:27] people then in America yeah you also
[44:29] have a lot of GRS movement but also
[44:31] there's ETFs I mean in Europe you also
[44:33] have ETFs but there's like a huge uh
[44:35] wave also from the political level it's
[44:38] really interesting how this all develops
[44:40] in in in Europe H how how do you see the
[44:42] community aspect currently in in in
[44:45] Europe and especially in the German
[44:46] speaking area uh basically I love it you
[44:50] know um I have no I don't have so much
[44:52] an opinion because it just works and I I
[44:55] love it you know I can go to a local
[44:57] Meetup and people are friendly I can go
[44:59] to a citadel yeah like an Austrian you
[45:01] know I can go to a German and I'm like
[45:04] we can talk about Bitcoin so honestly I
[45:06] love it and it doesn't matter you know
[45:08] if I have what I had like uh somebody
[45:11] from from a German Bank who like wanted
[45:15] to know like how does mixing and this
[45:17] stuff works you know or some like econ
[45:22] economical person you know like we are
[45:25] talking about like Global markets and
[45:26] these things that's where like I learned
[45:28] you know even one guy who's more like in
[45:30] the spiritual section and he's like like
[45:33] energy connected to bitcoin and
[45:34] everything
[45:35] so there's so much there and because all
[45:39] are kind of like interested making the
[45:41] world better and seeing Bitcoin as a
[45:45] tool or like a philosophy or not a
[45:48] religion but you know as as a Grassroots
[45:51] movement that's like I I like the
[45:53] community that's what I can tell yeah I
[45:57] mean if if you take the original like
[46:00] the actual word religion um I talked
[46:02] about it yesterday actually it's it's
[46:04] it's I think the meaning of it is like
[46:07] coming together or something like that
[46:09] and in that way you can if you define it
[46:12] if if there's a group of people coming
[46:14] together uh that's a relation for you I
[46:17] guess Bitcoin could be a relation we
[46:18] coming together a lot not only from like
[46:21] transa transactional layer but also in
[46:24] conferences all all over the world it's
[46:26] it's crazy to go you go to bitcoin
[46:28] conferences in Abu Dhabi America in in
[46:30] Prague and you meet the same people
[46:32] there yeah and they come together there
[46:34] yeah absolutely it's kind of a religion
[46:37] without like a leader or an idolized
[46:39] idol you know I mean to a certain extent
[46:43] satos Nakamoto is we don't know what
[46:45] satosi Nakamoto is if it's a person if
[46:47] it's a group of people if it's an alien
[46:50] if it's a time travel like we have no
[46:53] clue uh we can only speculate but uh
[46:57] that's that's kind of not a leader
[46:59] because he doesn't lead us but the the
[47:02] the at least
[47:04] the at least the figure uh it's a myth
[47:07] it's a myth yeah it's a myth it's a myth
[47:10] and uh he kind of like what he said is
[47:14] well
[47:15] documented and you can like kind
[47:18] of decide on on yourself if you if if
[47:22] you have the same opinion or not but
[47:25] what he started I think it already
[47:28] evolved Way Beyond him yeah absolutely
[47:31] it's it's or her or grish yeah what
[47:36] whatever it she or they are
[47:39] yeah um it's also interesting to think
[47:42] about uh I mean I just talked about that
[47:45] in the yesterday's episode but uh that's
[47:48] why it's in my head it's it's
[47:50] interesting to think about what if all
[47:53] of the sudden uh there's like a private
[47:55] message signed on the
[47:58] satoshi's first million Bitcoin he like
[48:01] I'm still here or something like that
[48:03] like that would be so fun to see the
[48:06] community reaction to that and the memes
[48:09] cre from that but I personally think
[48:11] those those those Bitcoin Will Never
[48:13] Move I think if if he's still alive
[48:15] which I point to to a very small
[48:18] likelihood um the the keys are probably
[48:21] already gone but yeah we we don't know
[48:23] but that's we we don't know and if it's
[48:26] you know a and not moving he kind of
[48:28] like deflated Bitcoin from 21 million to
[48:31] 20 million the same way that a lot of
[48:34] people already deflated
[48:37] it yeah yeah oh oh man I love this
[48:41] stories like oh I had a PC and I I I
[48:45] bought it and blah blah blah and
[48:47] everything and like okay where's your PC
[48:49] now like it's on on the garbage like
[48:52] somewhere yeah and like okay let's do a
[48:54] calculation how many Bitcoin did you buy
[48:56] and how many hours could we search how
[48:58] much you know is it is is it worth the
[49:01] effort you
[49:02] know did you hear about the recent one
[49:05] where uh he got in on Ledger he entered
[49:09] the pin wrong three times and the
[49:14] girlfriend threw away the the backup
[49:17] seat face because it was on a piece of
[49:19] paper
[49:22] uh that that that was a s a sad one but
[49:26] yeah also like why do you keep your
[49:28] backup seat phrase on a piece of
[49:30] paper well there are a lot of stories
[49:34] you know like flowing around yeah yeah
[49:37] absolutely I just a better story than
[49:39] the boating accident
[49:42] actually
[49:44] that's make it as public as possible so
[49:47] so the I believes you yeah like yeah and
[49:50] as the the more drama the better yeah
[49:54] that's that's true I let me see if I can
[49:57] find that just for yeah that just for
[50:00] the viewers that uh want to hear um
[50:05] about because there are still people
[50:07] that never heard a story of like how
[50:09] someone lost a Bitcoin I think that was
[50:11] my favorite one where I also talked on
[50:13] my podcast with Rick I mean not a
[50:15] favorite like it's it's not like
[50:17] something amazing that happens in terms
[50:19] of losing Bitcoin but I think it's
[50:23] really great conversation of
[50:27] uh uh of of like being aware that
[50:31] there's a lot of things that can happen
[50:32] and he had uh he he he had a lot of
[50:36] Bitcoin as as he stated like 25 Bitcoin
[50:38] and he had self custody and he took a
[50:41] lot of security measurements that I he
[50:45] his setup was probably more advanced
[50:47] than most of the setups actually but
[50:49] there are some uh mistakes it did along
[50:52] the way and I
[50:55] think if you go go to setup to setup
[50:58] from everyone in the Bitcoin Community
[51:00] uh you will see that most of the setups
[51:02] are actually uh not as secure as they
[51:05] think they are so you you you really
[51:08] have to uh double think like okay how
[51:11] how can this get wrong but what if that
[51:14] happens and all those situations play in
[51:16] your head and this is an A good episode
[51:19] if if people want to check it out uh
[51:22] where we have a pretty Advanced setup uh
[51:25] and some actually knew kind of what he
[51:29] was doing not to the extent that he is
[51:32] doing now he Now is really good in it um
[51:35] but to make you aware
[51:38] of how many things can go wrong and
[51:40] there are probably five more hours that
[51:42] we could record on that what small
[51:45] things can go wrong but I just want to
[51:47] make people aware of self custody that's
[51:49] what I always try to promote as as good
[51:52] as I can uh on on my channel here really
[51:57] cool um one thing I want to talk to you
[52:01] about before we come to the end of the
[52:03] podcast is the the future of Bitcoin in
[52:06] Europe uh I'm not that into politics
[52:09] probably you are also not that into
[52:10] politics um but how do you see that now
[52:15] uh America seems to steamroll ahead a
[52:17] little bit with with Bitcoin even Russia
[52:20] is talking about Bitcoin which is
[52:22] interesting to see also the bricks are
[52:24] talking about Bitcoin uh and Europe when
[52:27] they talking about Bitcoin it's always
[52:28] like oh like we we have to protect the
[52:31] consumer and we don't want
[52:33] Innovation how do you look at the
[52:36] developments of Bitcoin in
[52:39] Europe honestly I have friends who have
[52:42] like I can talk about it this is like um
[52:46] the the fortune telling like what could
[52:48] happen or what could
[52:51] be I have no clue you know like I'm I'm
[52:55] trying to spread the message locally if
[52:58] there are like
[52:59] regulations of course I'm I'm interested
[53:02] in like what this means but here I'm
[53:05] like just a technician you know I'm I'm
[53:07] working on open source software um and
[53:11] I'm waiting until something is really
[53:13] like written down by by the EU or the
[53:16] Austrian government and maybe there are
[53:19] things you know we we will like prepare
[53:22] but it's not where I like put my effort
[53:25] there are other people
[53:26] like who are more in that where I
[53:28] respect if they say hey we should be
[53:30] careful there is a warning I love the
[53:33] technical aspect of bcoin and that's
[53:35] where I will be so I'm sorry that you're
[53:37] not getting an real answer about this
[53:39] role that's a that's a good answer
[53:41] anyways I think that it's like the focus
[53:44] on on policies versus politics I think
[53:47] it's a really good one to focus on not
[53:50] what like not what the politicians and
[53:53] you level is doing but uh more like what
[53:56] what are the policies that then really
[53:58] affect me and and what is like then
[54:01] really actually in the Austrian law and
[54:02] and what is actually happening there
[54:05] yeah and this like don't get me wrong
[54:07] this is not ignoring what's happening
[54:09] it's just like keeping informed by
[54:12] people that like we
[54:13] trust and and who make sense this too uh
[54:18] but you know if they
[54:20] are like if if the regulations get too
[54:22] strict you know I'm like self-employed
[54:25] for 17 years
[54:26] I have no problem you know like with
[54:28] closing satosi engineering here in
[54:30] Austria and reopening for example in El
[54:33] Salvador you know like this is I'm not
[54:36] stuck I'm not stuck here yeah so I'm
[54:39] like this is what would be like um a d
[54:41] toop for me like a bad vision of the
[54:43] future like to close the company and
[54:45] open it up somewhere else because I grew
[54:49] up I love Austria and I have no problem
[54:51] you know doing everything by the book
[54:53] and see like how far I can go but at
[54:55] some point there limit you know then
[54:58] like okay still want to be self-employed
[55:00] still want to deal with Bitcoin maybe
[55:02] it's time for me like to go abroad yeah
[55:06] absolutely yeah that's is interesting uh
[55:09] but yeah um and and funny side note
[55:11] that's why like like uh every everyone
[55:15] that like from the company side that we
[55:17] deal with with Bitcoin or there's like a
[55:20] ticket or something we ask for an
[55:22] invoice you know we we do like we have
[55:25] to do our like U invoices and accounting
[55:27] properly and to get a feeling you know
[55:30] like how far the community is like to
[55:33] doing these things like how they should
[55:35] be
[55:37] yeah so yeah that's an interesting
[55:41] aspect yeah the especially if you get it
[55:44] in
[55:46] Bitcoin yeah yeah um let's come to the
[55:50] end of the podcast where two questions
[55:52] the first question is always the same
[55:54] for every guest uh and the question is
[55:56] what can we learn from you besides
[55:58] Bitcoin what can we for me as a
[56:01] person yeah from from you for me as a
[56:04] person uh wow you know it's this tricky
[56:07] thing how do I see myself like this
[56:09] tricky question no I think the first
[56:11] thing is to have like a positive
[56:13] attitude like how bad things get go to
[56:16] your 21 local group and talk to people
[56:19] like um if you feel bad find sameem
[56:24] minded people and if if you're a
[56:26] bitcoiner go to your local Bitcoin
[56:28] community and even
[56:30] like if they're hearing to your troubles
[56:32] in your fear world that's the one thing
[56:34] and the other one is um try to create a
[56:36] future together whatever this means like
[56:38] uh we are all like I think we as a human
[56:41] race are like built on passionate
[56:44] passion is what is like um helps our
[56:47] brain like to grow and and evolve and do
[56:50] something so if you're passionate of
[56:52] Bitcoin find another Bitcoin try to do
[56:54] something together and even if it's just
[56:56] you know talking about it or giving in
[56:59] your father's living room a small what
[57:01] is bitcoin thing yeah we have to do more
[57:04] Croots movement things um we usually
[57:06] have an end where the previous guest
[57:08] asking a question for the next guest uh
[57:10] uh without knowing who the next guest
[57:12] actually is but we have
[57:14] that already did that in the middle of
[57:16] the episode with the question of like uh
[57:18] what did you think about Bitcoin when
[57:20] you move it when you came into what got
[57:23] you in why did you stay uh so yeah think
[57:26] thank you so much for for that also um
[57:28] before I let you go where can people
