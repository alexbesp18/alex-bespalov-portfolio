[00:00] I'm Blown Away by the engineering of
[00:02] Bitcoin I think it's honestly incredible
[00:04] all nations would have to abstain from
[00:07] the Strategic Bitcoin Fund in order for
[00:09] this thing to go nowhere and as soon as
[00:11] one of them breaks and starts acquiring
[00:12] Bitcoin and they start building up their
[00:14] wealth they experience all the benefits
[00:16] of Bitcoin and they start to reduce
[00:18] their exposure to Fiat they experience
[00:20] you know the kind of runaway success of
[00:22] Bitcoin all the other nation states are
[00:24] incentivized to jump on it and jump on
[00:26] it quickly the first person to Flinch is
[00:28] the person that's going to kick off this
[00:30] this Bitcoin gold rush I do think it'll
[00:32] be sooner rather than later it does have
[00:34] that runaway potential like a black hole
[00:36] that sucks everything in it has the
[00:38] potential to basically kill the Fiat
[00:40] system and move us all over to bitcoin
[00:42] if it's an infinite money glitch then
[00:43] it's a black hole for Fiat and it will
[00:45] destroy Fiat even if you have a
[00:47] political stance against Bitcoin all of
[00:49] that should kind of be put to the side
[00:50] because it's it's a good engineering
[00:52] idea and it's a good economic idea I
[00:54] hate when politics gets involved in
[00:56] stuff like this because it it just
[00:57] blocks you from finding the optimal
[00:59] solution it shouldn't be a political
[01:01] decision it should be a mathematical one
[01:03] every time I learn something about the
[01:04] Fiat economy I I see from an engineering
[01:07] point of view this thing is going to
[01:08] blow up it's just not
[01:09] [Music]
[01:13] stable what are you trying to achieve
[01:16] with UK
[01:17] policies yeah so um I am the chief
[01:20] mining op the chief mining officer at
[01:23] Bitcoin policy
[01:24] UK and I'm an engineer by day I'm I'm a
[01:27] systems engineer so I've worked on some
[01:29] of the UK's most complex transport
[01:33] infrastructure and defense
[01:35] projects um and what we're looking to do
[01:38] at BP UK is find ways of integrating
[01:41] Bitcoin um not just into the economy for
[01:45] you know individuals to use but um into
[01:48] our energy grids because there's there's
[01:49] huge potential for it there I mean um
[01:53] Scotland and particular has has huge
[01:55] amounts of wind power and offshore wind
[01:57] power I think we're I think Scotland is
[01:59] less than 1% % of Europe's population
[02:02] but we have about 25% of Europe's wind
[02:05] power so there there is enormous
[02:07] potential there and I can get into it in
[02:10] a in a little bit but we're we're going
[02:12] to be facing in order to really scale
[02:14] that up and and to make the most of it
[02:16] we're we're going to need to do
[02:18] something different from what we're
[02:19] doing at the moment which is really just
[02:21] kind of building wind turbines and
[02:22] plugging them in and and forgetting
[02:24] about them uh so I'm working with with a
[02:26] few different colleagues at BP UK to try
[02:28] and come up with technical analysis and
[02:31] try and engage with the government and
[02:33] push them in a cons sensible direction
[02:35] to to make the most of it because it it
[02:37] could be a huge success story for the UK
[02:39] if we do it right but it could also be a
[02:42] a big kind of Cliff Edge that we're
[02:43] going to walk off if we do it
[02:45] wrong absolutely it's also interesting
[02:48] when we talk about uh what countries can
[02:51] do for Bitcoin that's basically uh a few
[02:54] things making good policies so that
[02:57] people can uh are not like that you want
[03:01] to have innovation in your country so
[03:03] people are liking like oh we should move
[03:05] there we should do something there the
[03:07] second thing is you can also put it on
[03:08] your balance sheet as strategic Bitcoin
[03:10] reserve and the other thing which is a
[03:13] thing is Overlook is the energy uh side
[03:15] of things with with Bitcoin there's so
[03:17] many different applications on that
[03:19] which is like the energy side of things
[03:21] even if you're politically against
[03:23] Bitcoin it's kind of hard to ignore uh
[03:26] the Bitcoin mining uh use case there
[03:29] yeah
[03:30] absolutely it's it's what I say to
[03:32] people in in in the engagements with
[03:34] government that we've had I've always I
[03:37] mean they know that what Bitcoin policy
[03:39] UK is about but I've always kind of said
[03:40] like look you don't you don't really
[03:42] need to know that it's Bitcoin we're
[03:44] talking about we're we're basically
[03:45] saying that there's going to be a buyer
[03:47] of Last Resort there's someone that is
[03:49] going to use all your stranded energy
[03:51] all your waste energy that we currently
[03:53] pay to curtail so we we pay for
[03:56] providers to turn the win turbines off
[03:58] and not only
[04:00] we're going to take that problem away
[04:01] but we're going to actually pay you for
[04:03] the power that you you would generate
[04:05] and um it sort of doesn't matter of
[04:08] what's going on behind there like it I
[04:10] don't think any of this should be a
[04:12] political issue at all it's it's an
[04:14] economic and a and an engineering issue
[04:16] and yeah to be honest even if you have a
[04:19] political stance against Bitcoin or you
[04:21] don't understand it all of that should
[04:23] kind of be put to the side because it's
[04:25] it's a good engineering idea and it's a
[04:27] good economic idea here so that's one of
[04:29] the things I try and kind of get across
[04:31] to people like if it helps just
[04:33] visualize it people are going to show up
[04:35] with shipping containers and pay you for
[04:37] energy that you otherwise couldn't sell
[04:39] and you you can kind of stop thinking
[04:40] about it there if you need to um it's
[04:43] it's a good way to think about it
[04:44] actually yeah yeah we're just going to
[04:47] plug in some some containers and they
[04:49] pay you for the electricity like if you
[04:52] sell electricity um to what extent do
[04:55] you even care what they're using their
[04:57] electricity for yeah for sure sure it's
[05:00] it's kind of one of the things that um
[05:02] it frustrates me about the arguments you
[05:04] know people that think Bitcoin is Magic
[05:06] internet money or it's um kind of
[05:09] frivolous or unnecessary I I think it's
[05:12] hard it's hard to refute refute that
[05:14] point in isolation because to an extent
[05:16] it's sort of true you know like we did
[05:19] have a world without Bitcoin but then to
[05:21] what extent is the entire economy
[05:23] frivolous and unnecessary I
[05:25] mean almost you would basically have to
[05:29] exclude everything except like
[05:30] industrial Commodities and that they're
[05:32] essential to make the world turn around
[05:35] I mean off the top of my head like the
[05:37] the entire entertainment and media
[05:39] industry most of the banking
[05:42] industry um everything from Disneyland
[05:46] to to
[05:48] Vacations so much of of the economy is
[05:51] you know you could make some weird
[05:52] argument that it's wasteful and and we
[05:54] shouldn't do it and Bitcoin is certainly
[05:56] no worse than that and I I would argue
[05:58] if you were to you know if you're to
[05:59] list the utility of everything that
[06:02] takes energy in the UK Bitcoin would it
[06:05] would be providing a lot of value for
[06:07] really not much energy so yeah I
[06:10] certainly I hear people make that point
[06:12] all the time
[06:14] and the the existing economy and the
[06:17] existing world doesn't stand up to that
[06:19] scrutiny that's that's a really good
[06:21] argument it's like that's why I usually
[06:24] I stay away if someone says like oh
[06:26] Bitcoin is using so much energy and stay
[06:28] away from that conversation was the
[06:29] conversation of like oh like before we
[06:32] even argue about how much energy it uses
[06:35] let's argue about why we use it in the
[06:37] first BL like why why should we have
[06:39] Bitcoin and once you understand why
[06:42] Bitcoin you don't care like it's not
[06:45] that that important how much energy like
[06:48] how much energy is actually quite
[06:49] important because it's the more the
[06:51] better the more the better protected the
[06:53] whole thing is so you actually want to
[06:55] to flip to like oh like we we want to
[06:57] make it more uh energy uh intensive to
[07:01] make it uh a better protection for our
[07:04] financial energy like it flips that
[07:06] whole thing thinging around and if
[07:08] you're only arguing about the
[07:10] consumption yes of course like making
[07:13] one Central database will consume less
[07:16] energy yeah yeah exactly and that that
[07:19] would entirely defeat the purpose of it
[07:23] um yeah it's it's something that's going
[07:26] to
[07:27] be an an Inc inreasing issue especially
[07:30] in the in the UK we have um we have an
[07:34] energy security strategy it was launched
[07:36] a couple of years ago and the the
[07:38] incoming government have actually um
[07:40] made it more ambitious and and uh
[07:43] brought our Targets in to be more
[07:45] imminent by 2030 or
[07:47] 2035 and the the plan is to basically
[07:51] three or fourx are current renewable
[07:54] Supply which is enormous when you
[07:56] consider you know everything we've done
[07:58] to build it in the past couple of days
[07:59] decades we are going to do three times
[08:01] that over the next decade which in a lot
[08:03] of ways you you would expect with a kind
[08:05] of Technology delivery program you know
[08:08] you have that scurve of development and
[08:11] and the UK government at least intends
[08:12] to enter the Steep part of it when it
[08:14] when it comes to renewable
[08:16] energy and this could be a really good
[08:20] thing for the UK when it's done right on
[08:23] a on an individual level basically when
[08:26] when renewable energy sources are
[08:28] producing
[08:30] they are they are generally the cheapest
[08:32] in the world they they don't consume any
[08:34] fuel they're they're very low
[08:35] maintenance the problem is intermittency
[08:39] that the wind doesn't always blow the
[08:40] sun doesn't always shine um you have to
[08:43] have backup uh for that and and that
[08:46] costs money that adds it adds redundancy
[08:49] it adds complexity into the system and
[08:51] there there are costs associated with
[08:53] that
[08:54] now when you're moving from a grid that
[08:57] is 100% fossil power
[09:00] uh like like the UK was or you know you
[09:02] throw some nuclear in there but um the
[09:05] advantage of fossil power is that it
[09:07] responds fairly quickly to changes in
[09:10] demand you can you can basically
[09:12] throttle up a gas power plant or a Coal
[09:14] Power Plant and match it to supply uh
[09:18] match it to demand in real time and
[09:21] we're facing this problem where you
[09:22] cannot do that with
[09:24] Renewables if you are one of the first
[09:28] owners of a WI turbine in a country that
[09:31] is mostly uh fossil powered you have
[09:34] assurance that 100% of your supply is
[09:37] going to be purchased there will there
[09:38] will be demand for it and that happens
[09:40] because someone will Throttle Down a
[09:42] fossil Source uh as the renewable energy
[09:45] comes online so the wind blows and
[09:47] somewhere a gas power plant will will
[09:49] switch off and it'll switch back on
[09:51] later when uh when the wind stops so
[09:54] that's quite a nice situation it's it's
[09:56] quite cushy it's the situation that the
[09:58] UK has been in um basically since we
[10:01] started building
[10:02] Renewables but we are going to hit this
[10:04] problem where long before you hit 100%
[10:08] renewable you're going to have this this
[10:11] scenario where on a really windy day or
[10:13] a really sunny day the the renewable
[10:16] Supply is going to exceed the demand so
[10:18] you won't have stranded energy for which
[10:20] there is no buyer in the
[10:23] market that becomes a problem because
[10:26] you're going to get diminishing returns
[10:27] on all the renewable projects happen
[10:29] after that once your once your Peak
[10:31] renewable Supply hits 100% of the demand
[10:34] anything you build beyond that will not
[10:37] have a 100%
[10:39] utilization so that means you get these
[10:41] diminishing returns the business case
[10:43] for Renewables drops as you build more
[10:46] and more Renewables this uh this
[10:48] transition kind of becomes a victim of
[10:50] its own success a great example of this
[10:53] is one of the the offshore wind farms
[10:56] closest to where I live Scotland has
[10:58] most of the wind energy in the UK but
[11:00] England has most of the consumption
[11:02] getting the energy to to the areas where
[11:04] it's needed is a problem so you can have
[11:06] situations where you're having to fire
[11:08] up gas power plants you know in
[11:10] southeast England when you have an
[11:12] excess of energy in Scotland simply
[11:14] because you cannot get it there um the
[11:17] wind turbine I think it's one of the
[11:19] newest ones I think it's Scotland's
[11:21] largest ones is is called SE green and
[11:24] the curtailment so the the periods where
[11:26] we have to effectively switch it off and
[11:29] pay suppliers compensate them for the
[11:31] money they would have made uh is
[11:34] somewhere between 60 and
[11:35] 70% so actually the majority of its time
[11:39] is
[11:39] downtime um it's cost us more than 100
[11:42] million pound so far this is a situation
[11:46] that you know we knew was going to
[11:48] happen it's not
[11:49] surprising it's not even
[11:52] necessarily that bad news because if
[11:54] you're if you're delivering cheap energy
[11:56] and you're delivering value elsewhere
[11:58] your utilization
[12:00] isn't all that important but um it's a
[12:03] sign that we're going to have to tackle
[12:05] this problem of intermittency uh in
[12:07] order to get anywhere near where we want
[12:08] to be on renewable energy and in order
[12:11] to lower bills for people I mean uh of
[12:14] the the total amount of renewable energy
[12:16] that the UK produces somewhere around 4%
[12:20] of it has to be curtailed it's not a lot
[12:24] but that is something like 750 million a
[12:27] year so it's not high percentage it's a
[12:30] huge amount of cash and if there's some
[12:32] way that we could uh we could keep a
[12:34] hold of that cash instead of paying it
[12:36] out effectively as compensation we
[12:39] should probably do
[12:40] that and is the is is the whole thing
[12:43] also with uh what I don't understand
[12:45] from from more the the green and the
[12:48] left leaning uh forces that say like oh
[12:51] like we we we don't like Bitcoin and
[12:54] then like oh but what are the most green
[12:57] most renewable uh Industries and like
[13:00] Bitcoin mining is I don't know if it's
[13:03] the top one but it's definitely on the
[13:05] top ones like if it would be a c it
[13:07] would be uh as I'm understanding it the
[13:10] the most renew like it has the highest
[13:12] percentage of renewable energy uh which
[13:15] is really fascinating and obviously
[13:18] Bitcoin mining has one cost and this is
[13:20] the electricity cost and the the
[13:22] machines but like one running cost of of
[13:25] the machine and uh this is the biggest
[13:27] expense for Bitcoin miners so they go
[13:30] wherever the cheapest electricity is and
[13:32] for for for me and I'm not an expert in
[13:34] this this has to be renewable over the
[13:36] long run yeah yeah so I think I I hate
[13:43] when politics gets involved in stuff
[13:44] like this because it it just blocks you
[13:47] from finding the optimal solution it it
[13:49] shouldn't be a political decision it
[13:51] should be a mathematical one and yeah I
[13:55] I know exactly what you mean when you
[13:57] talk about like ideologies um you know
[14:00] obstructing one thing or maybe leading
[14:02] us to a a suboptimal conclusion
[14:05] elsewhere I would I wouldn't want to
[14:09] appeal to ideologies because I don't
[14:10] think they should be here in the first
[14:12] place but if if I had to appeal to the
[14:14] kind of leftwing green ideology I would
[14:16] I'd firstly point out look Bitcoin
[14:17] mining with this stranded energy um it
[14:21] makes green energy more profitable it
[14:24] lowers the marginal cost of it because
[14:26] you don't have this waste product
[14:29] um if you can I mean at the moment the
[14:33] what the UK government does it it
[14:34] compensates producers for the notional
[14:36] energy they would have made so that a
[14:38] that a government
[14:39] subsidy and that is that's basically a
[14:43] market Distortion that is not something
[14:44] that is innate to the technology it's
[14:47] something artificial that we're having
[14:49] to put in there but adding Bitcoin
[14:51] mining to renewable energy means that
[14:54] there there is a an innate a natural
[14:56] buyer for this stranded energy so
[15:00] it means renewable energy makes more
[15:01] money it's more profitable it's a more
[15:03] attractive
[15:04] investment if you like renewable energy
[15:07] if you're politically aligned with it
[15:09] then you should be politically aligned
[15:10] with with anything that will give it a
[15:12] boost and you know on the flip side the
[15:16] I mean the you know the revenue that you
[15:19] make from from mining it depends on what
[15:21] you're paying for electricity depends on
[15:23] the hash rate the the capital expense of
[15:25] your mining but generally we know the
[15:29] the break even point for mining is
[15:30] somewhere around 5 Cent per uh kilowatt
[15:34] hour and that's extremely low that's
[15:36] below anything that retail is paying
[15:39] generally in a developed country it's
[15:42] pretty much below anything you can do
[15:44] with fossil fuels in a developed country
[15:46] at least so again Bitcoin mining is you
[15:49] know
[15:50] profitably increasingly difficult or
[15:53] impossible to do with fossil fuels so
[15:54] this is something that gives Renewables
[15:56] a boost and it doesn't give fossil fuels
[15:57] a boost it's it's not just a it's not
[16:00] just an increase in demand for energy
[16:02] across the board it's an increase in
[16:04] demand for the very cheapest energy in
[16:06] the world which tends to be renewable
[16:08] energy and um you kind of mentioned it
[16:11] earlier like most buyers of electricity
[16:14] do not
[16:16] discriminate uh against where the
[16:17] electricity comes from like you you turn
[16:19] your toaster on you you don't know or
[16:22] care who generated those electrons and
[16:25] and what fuel they used uh and Bitcoin
[16:27] miners are they're one of the few
[16:29] consumers that actually do care where
[16:30] their electricity came from interesting
[16:33] how does nuclear come into this I mean I
[16:36] know that in Austria and Germany it's
[16:38] like Pro probably like one of the only
[16:41] kind of silos in the world that are very
[16:44] much against nuclear I'm not uh but
[16:47] nuclear seems to be an amazing solution
[16:50] also pair paired with with Bitcoin
[16:53] mining and and for for energy in the
[16:55] future I think even Trump mentioned it
[16:57] uh in in his speech in in the in the how
[17:01] is that word spell like inauguration uh
[17:05] Speech yeah yeah really interesting
[17:07] stuff happens with the the economics of
[17:09] nuclear in the
[17:11] construction so the UK is currently
[17:13] having huge problems with nuclear kind
[17:15] of similar to Germany we have nuclear
[17:17] plants that are they're coming to the
[17:18] end of their service life and we are
[17:21] trying to build more nuclear plants to
[17:23] replace them there's probably going to
[17:24] be a gap because of poor planning from
[17:26] the government but there are the cost of
[17:30] nuclear is generally very high because
[17:32] of safety and the UK is experiencing
[17:34] enormous cost
[17:36] overruns and you hit this Fiat problem
[17:39] where the UK's cost of borrowing is
[17:42] quite High inflation is quite high that
[17:44] really didn't help nuclear plants
[17:46] because they are so expensive they take
[17:48] decades to develop and they operate for
[17:51] decades the interest rate that you are
[17:53] paying on any debt used to to construct
[17:56] it becomes the dominant factor and I
[17:59] forgotten the exact number but I I think
[18:00] it was maybe something like 70% of the
[18:03] the cost of construction of the nuclear
[18:05] plants we're planning in the UK was just
[18:07] financing cost so it's that Fiat problem
[18:10] it's it's the cost of debt in a Fiat
[18:13] system um so that's got it's kind of
[18:16] it's nothing to do with nuclear physics
[18:18] or or how they will operate they're
[18:20] they're extremely expensive to to build
[18:23] in the in the traditional way that's is
[18:25] why the UK is looking at small modular
[18:27] reactors which they're not really much
[18:30] less complex they're much cheaper to
[18:31] build they're just because they're
[18:33] physically smaller uh they're a lot
[18:35] faster that the financing costs are a
[18:37] lot lower and then that removes some of
[18:39] that kind of Fiat cost of financing
[18:42] problem there basically all of that
[18:43] means that the the cost of electricity
[18:45] from nuclear plants has to absorb all
[18:48] that kind of Fiat stuff so the cost of
[18:50] nuclear
[18:51] energy in reality in the UK tends to be
[18:54] quite High probably higher than what we
[18:58] be uh what would be feasible to mine
[19:00] Bitcoin with whether we make some sort
[19:03] of breakthrough with small modular
[19:04] reactors or whether we find a way to
[19:07] kind of unfat that situation you know
[19:09] that could change things uh as I see it
[19:12] nuclear will primly remain it will
[19:15] remain the the base Supply probably not
[19:17] that economic to mine with um it's
[19:20] certainly something I think we should be
[19:22] doing anyway because you know not for
[19:25] Bitcoin but for the sake of uh everyone
[19:28] in the UK or the the businesses and the
[19:30] the
[19:31] consumers and um yeah certainly I
[19:35] think I don't I don't know a lot about
[19:38] the energy scene in Germany but they
[19:40] seem to have had this problem it seems
[19:41] to be an ideological problem not an
[19:43] engineering problem where they simply uh
[19:46] they brought their old power plants
[19:48] offline before they really had anything
[19:50] to replace them
[19:52] and that's just straightforwardly not a
[19:54] good idea at all nor is being reliant on
[19:57] hostile foreign Nations Spar supply of
[19:59] fossil
[20:00] fuels yeah and the dependency on of of
[20:04] Russia was on with the energy also
[20:06] really big uh which which is uh
[20:10] yeah Germany had a big problem with
[20:12] energy like still has I feel like uh
[20:14] with turning off the nuclear plants and
[20:17] then being extremely depending on other
[20:21] nations uh it's is I think it's a
[20:23] strategic mistake the same mistake the
[20:26] same strategic mistake as selling
[20:29] 50k uh Bitcoin which which you did so
[20:34] like the Germany has
[20:36] a a long sequence of bad strategic uh
[20:42] mistakes where that's why I see a lot of
[20:44] Bitcoin is actually moving I I I don't
[20:46] know if if there there are a lot of
[20:49] Germans in El Salvador I was amazed how
[20:52] many Germans there are in in El Sala
[20:55] considering how far away it is like I
[20:58] live close to Germany I traveled around
[21:02] 20 to 24 hours including every travel
[21:05] time to there so like it takes a long
[21:07] time because there no direct flights you
[21:09] have to fly over America or Canada and
[21:11] then fly down there so like it's a long
[21:13] travel time uh so I was amazed how many
[21:17] Germans there are already in in El
[21:20] Salvador uh but yeah that's a different
[21:22] topic it's interesting uh for me where
[21:24] the future of energy and and in my of
[21:27] energy especially uh develops I have no
[21:31] clue about energy markets and and all
[21:33] those those things I get more and more
[21:35] information because I talk with Bitcoin
[21:37] Miners and talk with people that know
[21:39] about it uh do you have an opinion on
[21:41] where we go with the future of energy in
[21:44] in general and how Bitcoin is kind of
[21:48] influencing where the future of energy
[21:50] is
[21:51] going yeah sure so I'm going to come
[21:56] back to my to my profession as a syst
[21:59] engineer so let me give you a bit
[22:01] background before I answer your question
[22:03] so so my job is to work in complex
[22:06] systems whether it is Railways or or
[22:09] airlanes or or nuclear programs where
[22:13] you have basically engineering
[22:15] Specialists so you have say electrical
[22:17] engineers mechanical engineers fluid
[22:20] dynamicists that sort of thing and they
[22:22] all have very good deep knowledge in a
[22:25] particular topic but then someone needs
[22:27] to tie the whole whole thing together
[22:29] and make sure that all the different
[22:31] components work with each other
[22:34] positively
[22:36] and sometimes that means doing kind of
[22:39] nonintuitive things or or things that
[22:41] maybe wouldn't make sense to one
[22:43] specialist like an example might be if
[22:45] if you were building a car I mean a car
[22:48] is to transport you from A to B it needs
[22:50] to move so adding brakes onto a car
[22:54] might seem like a weird idea like brakes
[22:56] prevent you moving they slow you down
[22:58] why why on Earth would you add those to
[22:59] the car and you know anyone that's seen
[23:03] a car kind of understands exactly why
[23:05] you need you don't just need Wheels you
[23:07] need things like steering and brakes and
[23:10] and a gearbox in order to make that
[23:12] thing perform a much more complex
[23:15] navigation of the real world I think
[23:17] we're going to see a similar thing with
[23:19] our energy grid previously you Simply
[23:22] Built fossil fuel power plant up to
[23:25] basically the maximum Demand on on the
[23:27] worst day of the year
[23:28] and you turn them up and down you match
[23:30] them to demand in real time and that was
[23:32] kind of it it was a fairly simple I'm
[23:35] not even sure I'd call it a system it
[23:36] was just a fairly simple kind of like
[23:38] input output sort of arrangement and now
[23:41] if we're going to be adding a diversity
[23:44] of of generation techniques which are
[23:46] all really fundamentally different so I
[23:49] mean for example nuclear is quite binary
[23:52] it tends to be on or off it takes days
[23:54] to start up or shut down or to vary the
[23:57] output um um fossil fuels like I said
[24:00] they can be throttled within seconds or
[24:02] tens of seconds you have new
[24:04] technologies like batteries that are
[24:06] actually um they can save a lot of money
[24:09] in the short term because they can
[24:10] respond in you know milliseconds I can
[24:13] talk a little bit more about them and
[24:14] then you have Renewables which
[24:16] have uh they have intermittency that is
[24:20] perhaps predictable you know hours or
[24:22] days out and then kind of predictable in
[24:24] aggregate over over the long run over
[24:27] years um
[24:29] you have other storage methods I mean
[24:31] like Hydro storage so you know pumping
[24:33] water back uphill to to act as a kind of
[24:35] physical gravity battery there are
[24:38] people looking into Innovative energy
[24:40] storage techniques like uh like kinetic
[24:42] storage like flywheels or raising and
[24:45] lowering weights up and down M shafts so
[24:48] there's going to be a lot more
[24:49] complexity to it a lot more diversity
[24:52] into in the components of the energy
[24:53] grid you have the grid itself and
[24:56] bottlenecks around it again this is it's
[24:58] a system that set up for
[25:01] centralization you have centralized
[25:03] population centers and you have
[25:04] centralized generation you know you have
[25:06] a small number of power plants that
[25:08] generate all the energy that's now no
[25:10] longer going to be the case you have you
[25:13] have people like me with solar panels in
[25:15] the roof and sometimes they're suppliers
[25:17] and sometimes they're customers so
[25:20] there's so much more complex to it
[25:22] becomes a very complex system that needs
[25:25] managed at that high level and and my
[25:29] opinion is there are a lot of
[25:32] governments perhaps like Germany's
[25:34] perhaps like the UK's to an extent that
[25:36] are just not thinking that way they're
[25:38] still just they're thinking in a very
[25:40] linear way of just I don't know build
[25:42] power plants if we need more power just
[25:44] build another wind turbine and it it's
[25:45] just not going to work like that it's
[25:47] going to need to be managed um in a much
[25:50] more complex way yeah like the the the
[25:53] whole whole thing of it is really
[25:55] complex I love um so so I love that you
[25:59] explained what a system engineer is
[26:00] because this would have been one of my
[26:02] next question like what a systems
[26:03] engineer actually is doing how do you
[26:05] how does um a system engineer look at
[26:09] Bitcoin the the whole system of the the
[26:12] the Bitcoin design kind of how do you
[26:14] look at that and what is the genius in
[26:17] in this this whole
[26:19] design yeah I love it that
[26:21] was it was looking at it as a systems
[26:24] engineer that allowed me to first get
[26:26] into it so I got into it and I think
[26:29] 2013 and back then like I can't code and
[26:33] I didn't know anything about economics
[26:35] so the only way I could kind of assess
[26:37] it was as an
[26:39] engineer so I looked at the way it self
[26:43] adjusts so beautifully like the the hash
[26:45] rate versus the the difficulty the
[26:49] decentralization which actually makes it
[26:52] stronger um something we look for in
[26:54] engineering is whether something has a
[26:56] natural stability which
[26:59] um it's always kind of hard to explain
[27:01] but you you'll know exactly what I mean
[27:03] so like if you were to balance an object
[27:05] on the tip of your finger that is
[27:08] naturally unstable it will tend to fall
[27:10] off um it's it's almost like entropy
[27:13] it's like anything anything that pushes
[27:15] it one way it will experience a
[27:17] self-reinforcing behavior without anyone
[27:20] pushing it or controlling it and will
[27:22] tend towards dysfunction like you you
[27:24] balance something in your finger it'll
[27:25] fall off and hit the floor and then
[27:27] there are things like natural stability
[27:30] a physical example of that would be if
[27:33] you put a ball in a dish it will
[27:36] naturally fall to the lowest point in
[27:38] the dish and it will if you pull it up
[27:40] it will roll back down so that is
[27:41] something that is naturally stable it
[27:43] will always revert
[27:44] to basically a central point and stop
[27:47] moving and you want to design that into
[27:49] all your systems as an engineer um you
[27:53] you primly don't really know it but your
[27:55] your car is naturally stable if you take
[27:57] your hands off the wheel the steering
[27:59] wheel will rotate to a central point
[28:01] your car will go in a straight line if
[28:03] it was unstable your car if you let go
[28:05] of the wheel it would you know turn or
[28:07] flip over or whatever if you've ever
[28:10] seen um video or if you've ever
[28:12] experienced a car fishtailing you know
[28:14] where like the back wheels slide out to
[28:16] one side and then you overcorrect and
[28:19] they slide out even further the other
[28:20] way so despite you being in control or
[28:24] at least trying to control the car it
[28:25] fishtails and eventually you know you
[28:27] wipe out you crash off the road um
[28:30] that's because you hit uh you basically
[28:33] hit a set of conditions where there was
[28:34] Dynamic
[28:35] instability and that's what you want to
[28:37] try and design out of a system because
[28:39] that's really dangerous anything that
[28:41] enters a feedback loop um whether it's a
[28:44] car fishtailing or I mean a nuclear
[28:47] reactor will naturally melt down or
[28:50] explode you need tight control to keep
[28:52] it on track systems Engineers is try and
[28:54] fundamentally design all that stuff out
[28:56] and again that's something that the you
[28:59] cannot do that at a component level so
[29:02] you cannot look at the car and say okay
[29:04] how do I design the seats so that this
[29:06] car doesn't fish tail how do I design
[29:09] the tires so it doesn't fish tail none
[29:10] of that's going to work you have to
[29:13] understand exactly how the car moves how
[29:15] all the systems interact together on a
[29:17] on a dynamic level in order to make
[29:19] those sorts of design decisions so yeah
[29:21] I spent I literally I heard about
[29:23] Bitcoin one day and I spent an afternoon
[29:25] reading about it and everything I
[29:27] learned about it all I could see was
[29:29] this natural stability any any sort of
[29:33] disturbance would either strengthen it
[29:35] or it would revert back to a stable uh a
[29:38] stable State you know uh relatively
[29:41] quickly and I didn't know where Bitcoin
[29:44] was going to go or what it was going to
[29:45] do but I freshly thought like look this
[29:47] thing is not going to go away um because
[29:50] it's naturally stable you can you can
[29:52] kind of push it off course you can try
[29:54] and influence the price you can ban it
[29:56] in certain areas um
[29:58] but it's not going to do it that much
[30:00] harm and I also thought like okay
[30:03] thinking you you have a global money
[30:06] that is dynamically stable unlike
[30:09] Fiat um my thesis back then when I
[30:12] bought Bitcoin was like well I don't
[30:14] know what I'm going to do with this but
[30:16] I doubt it's going to be useless like
[30:18] what is the probability that Global
[30:20] money that is dynamically stable no one
[30:22] ever finds a use for it what are the
[30:24] odds of that the odds of it would be
[30:26] tiny so it was kind of a a leap of faith
[30:29] but like un informed one from a from an
[30:32] engineering mindset how has how has this
[30:35] changed since since then I don't know
[30:37] like what what year this was but like
[30:38] how has this changed since since then
[30:40] your feces or like evolved no because
[30:44] the code hasn't changed the the
[30:45] fundamental properties of Bitcoin hasn't
[30:47] changed I mean we have all changed
[30:50] around it the world has has positioned
[30:52] itself around Bitcoin and we we now do a
[30:55] lot more things with it we use it and
[30:57] loads of different ways there there are
[30:59] companies there you know Layer Two
[31:02] Solutions um but on a fundamental level
[31:05] like if if you imagine Bitcoin is a
[31:06] machine it hasn't changed uh my my
[31:10] thesis on the rest of the economy the
[31:13] Fiat economy has changed since 2013
[31:15] because the more I learn about it the
[31:17] more worried I get about it um because
[31:21] everywhere you look you see Dynamic
[31:24] instability in that there is you know
[31:27] for example there is there is no limit
[31:29] to the amount of Fiat so we could we
[31:31] could print Fiat and we could also
[31:33] destroy
[31:34] Fiat it could go either way but really
[31:36] the political incentives are always to
[31:38] to give people money to give people
[31:40] handouts um to expand public services to
[31:45] cut taxes in a way that pushes you into
[31:48] this unstable feedback loop almost like
[31:51] like a fishtailing which I think we're
[31:52] kind of seeing in the economy now um and
[31:57] you know people I don't know people get
[31:59] very angry at politicians some people
[32:00] get conspiratorial about it and you know
[32:03] I'm I'm angry at politicians as well but
[32:06] that's really just the inherent
[32:07] properties of the system the incentives
[32:09] strongly push you towards printing money
[32:11] the incentives you're just not
[32:13] incentivized to destroy money to to
[32:16] reverse the the money printer to to
[32:19] stabilize
[32:20] Fiat especially I mean this is something
[32:22] pet McCormick talks about a lot if if
[32:24] you're on a four or five year election
[32:26] cycle the benefits of printing money uh
[32:30] are huge and immediate the benefits of
[32:33] destroying money they would be huge but
[32:35] they'll be very long term and very
[32:37] unpopular in the short term and if if
[32:39] you're a
[32:40] politician or you know frankly if you're
[32:42] a human with a with a finite career um
[32:46] making those very long-term decisions is
[32:48] just not something you're incentivized
[32:49] to do at all so the Fiat system is full
[32:53] of these broken incentives and I think
[32:57] this is something l alden's very good at
[32:59] talking about and she understands the
[33:01] you know the economy much much better
[33:03] than I do but um yeah the every every
[33:06] time I learn something about the Fiat
[33:08] economy I I see from an engineering
[33:10] point of view you know this thing is
[33:11] going to blow up it's just not stable I
[33:14] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[33:18] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[33:21] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[33:23] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[33:26] vigilante made perfect Bitcoin watch
[33:29] that's the perfect subtle elegant way to
[33:32] go out there and show that you are a
[33:35] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[33:37] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[33:41] dropped a completely new and amazing
[33:43] Genesis edition of their watch
[33:46] collections you have the date of the
[33:48] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[33:52] and of course also the block height and
[33:54] which EPO we are currently in I love off
[33:58] the level of detail they put in in this
[34:00] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[34:03] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[34:06] down in the descriptions I love those
[34:08] watches so so much if you watch or
[34:12] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[34:14] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[34:17] and now the most important step is to
[34:19] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[34:22] hardware wallet my personal
[34:24] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[34:26] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[34:28] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[34:31] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[34:34] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[34:37] with the code Robin at the checkout
[34:39] visit bitbox dos Swiss robobin to get
[34:43] your bitbox and the next step is to
[34:46] really level up your sovereignty as an
[34:48] individual you have to have the most
[34:50] secure self custody setup you have to
[34:53] secure your own devices you have to
[34:56] protect your privacy you have to set up
[34:59] an inheritance plan and depending on
[35:01] where you live you even want to have a
[35:04] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[35:07] in case something goes really really
[35:08] wrong and through all those steps the
[35:10] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[35:13] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[35:16] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[35:20] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[35:23] how you can level up your
[35:25] sovereignty and it's kind of amazing to
[35:28] to to see like I follow the numbers of
[35:33] the United States I follow the numbers
[35:35] of Austria follow the numbers of
[35:37] different kind of regions and I'm like
[35:39] like oh that country doubled the depth
[35:41] in like five six years that can't is
[35:44] doing that it's it's it's kind of
[35:46] amazing that the system still works like
[35:49] that Fe is still
[35:51] around so much instability and uh in so
[35:55] much uh factors at Play hey it's like
[35:59] how much of that is because of human
[36:02] psychology because people accept fear as
[36:04] it is like you you like people that are
[36:08] um now under let's say 50 or 40 years
[36:10] old they all been born into basically
[36:13] feeld currencies they have all been like
[36:16] um trained into this Behavior like all
[36:18] that that that those those Cur coins
[36:22] that we have like money and those coins
[36:23] are probably more money than than the
[36:25] bills and the the the other things but
[36:28] uh it's like they they they money and
[36:31] and and we just use that money how much
[36:33] does this human psychology play also in
[36:36] in in that feeld
[36:38] design yeah for sure um I I think it's a
[36:42] huge element of it there's
[36:45] there's something very Sinister about a
[36:49] system that is controlled by by a group
[36:52] of humans now if you've ever been on a
[36:56] committee or I don't know even even a
[36:58] group of friends trying to decide where
[37:00] to go for dinner like reaching that
[37:02] consensus as as a bunch of humans is is
[37:05] very slow it can be a really good way of
[37:08] doing things but it's just not a speedy
[37:10] way of doing things and you know flash
[37:12] crashes can happen in in milliseconds
[37:15] and
[37:16] certainly you know Market downturns or
[37:19] reactions to bad incentives can happen
[37:21] very quickly much quicker than
[37:23] governments can react especially if they
[37:25] have to pass legislation that sort of
[37:27] thing and during that you have all these
[37:32] psychological um I guess these
[37:34] psychological effects playing out like I
[37:36] don't think our politicians or our
[37:38] economists understand their own biases
[37:41] or their own uh lack of understanding
[37:44] when it comes to you know numbers
[37:47] numeracy um and I I think that's where
[37:49] you get a lot of this dysfunction
[37:51] whether it is overreaction or reacting
[37:54] far too late or denial of a problem
[37:57] again as an engineer this is this is a
[37:59] really bad control system you need
[38:01] something that can react just as quick
[38:04] as a problem arises not N9 months
[38:07] afterwards and you need something that
[38:09] is that is free from bias this is this
[38:11] is why we use digital control in things
[38:14] that can um that can break really
[38:16] quickly I mean going back to the nuclear
[38:19] power plan analogy like a nuclear
[38:22] reactor is held on the point of
[38:24] criticality all its life and if you if
[38:27] it goes one way it will uh the reactions
[38:30] will go exponential and it'll explode or
[38:33] it'll melt down if it goes the other way
[38:35] the reactions will uh they'll go
[38:38] basically negative exponential they'll
[38:39] die off very quickly so you use
[38:42] basically digital control that can react
[38:45] fast enough to it you you don't have a
[38:46] human like pooling levers trying to keep
[38:48] that thing working in real time it's
[38:50] just not possible um you you see it
[38:54] absolutely everywhere like from from
[38:56] airplanes I mean modern fighter jets are
[38:59] dynamically unstable things like the UR
[39:01] fighter
[39:02] typhoon they you know you can fly them
[39:04] in a straight line but it's only because
[39:06] a computer is constantly correcting it
[39:08] would it would naturally just back flip
[39:10] and then tumble to the ground it's it's
[39:12] not a stable thing but you can fly it as
[39:15] if it is as long as you have computer
[39:17] control that can react faster than the
[39:19] thing can become unstable the I I can't
[39:23] think of a way of implementing like some
[39:25] sort of digital correction over the
[39:28] entire economy which is fundamental
[39:30] fundamentally a very human system like
[39:32] we all relate to it so for me the only
[39:35] other opportunity is to the only other
[39:37] solution is to hard code out those
[39:39] instabilities like I do not think the
[39:41] economy can be managed where we don't
[39:43] have these booms and busts and
[39:47] everything going exponential which is
[39:49] you know as you pointed out we're really
[39:50] seeing us hitting that steep part the
[39:52] exponential Curves in in various sectors
[39:56] like like deficit in government debt so
[39:58] I don't think it's possible to control
[40:00] that but I think it's possible to hard
[40:02] code that problem out do you think that
[40:05] the difficulty adjustment is kind of the
[40:08] the the natural stabilizer of of of
[40:11] Bitcoin yeah for sure and I think I
[40:16] think there are more there are more
[40:17] subtle ones like the the
[40:19] decentralization uh the fact that to be
[40:22] honest the the fact that the 51% attack
[40:26] destroys the cred ility of the asset
[40:28] that you're investing in so people are
[40:30] good actors are incentivized to avoid it
[40:33] and and Bad actors are it becomes
[40:35] basically impossible to do so you see a
[40:38] lot of these um these feedback loops
[40:41] pushing things in the right way um yeah
[40:44] like the the difficulty adjustment and
[40:45] the hash rate prevents I mean for starts
[40:48] it prevents all the coins being mined at
[40:49] once which would then I don't know I I
[40:53] think you know Bitcoin would be over and
[40:54] done with and it would it would remove a
[40:56] lot of the beauty of it so having having
[40:58] a steady supply no matter how much
[41:00] effort you put into it I think is very
[41:02] important and it creates all that really
[41:04] interesting game theory stuff where
[41:06] miners want to I mean it creates the
[41:09] solution to the energy stuff I was
[41:10] talking about where all of a sudden if
[41:12] if the supply is constrained but the
[41:15] effort you put into finding it isn't
[41:17] you're incentivized to be big and
[41:20] efficient you're incentivized to have
[41:21] the biggest mine you can possibly have
[41:23] for the lowest capital cost and the
[41:25] lowest operating cost so so I'm I'm
[41:29] Blown Away by the engineering of Bitcoin
[41:32] I I think it's honestly incredible
[41:34] because if if there were any one of
[41:36] these aspects that led to a runaway
[41:39] behavior that led to a
[41:41] meltdown it wouldn't work you know the
[41:43] the code would have executed for I don't
[41:45] know minutes days months years and then
[41:49] it would have eventually gone into
[41:51] dysfunction it would have been
[41:52] inevitable I I don't know when but I can
[41:55] tell you it would have happened so
[41:57] you know I I have no idea who Satoshi is
[42:00] I don't have any particular theories
[42:01] over who he is but I I think it's
[42:03] absolutely incredible that he nailed
[42:06] every possible source of instability
[42:08] every possible attack Vector on on his
[42:11] first goal
[42:13] because you know if you think of any
[42:15] other
[42:16] technology whether it's an airplane or a
[42:19] computer you usually spend a couple of
[42:21] decades with like a really [ __ ] version
[42:23] of it that doesn't work and it's a kind
[42:25] of interesting principle but it's got
[42:27] critical flaws that mean it's useless
[42:29] for everyone but um Bitcoin he he hit a
[42:32] home run on his on his first shot and
[42:34] then disappeared and to me that's that's
[42:37] amazing it's such an amazing story it's
[42:39] such a a masterful invention it blows my
[42:43] mind every time I think about it it's
[42:45] it's the genius of aligning incentives
[42:48] and making everyone kind of working
[42:51] together and and even if you're a bad
[42:54] actor you kind of incentivize to to be a
[42:56] good actor it's it's it's a stroke of
[42:59] Genius I love that yeah really cool then
[43:03] yeah it's super one thing um about the
[43:07] uh the system Engineers I'm also
[43:09] interested do you think that Bitcoin is
[43:12] truly anti fragile is is there like from
[43:15] a system engineering standpoint nothing
[43:17] that kind of comes into in into his way
[43:21] uh something that could bring Bitcoin
[43:25] out of this stable state yeah I I've
[43:27] never found anything that that
[43:29] approaches that um I'm not I'm not quite
[43:33] sure if it meets the technical
[43:35] definition of antifragile because it
[43:37] kind of depends how you how you define
[43:39] strength but certainly there are there
[43:41] are so many antifragile
[43:44] traits across all the incentives
[43:48] and one of the most interesting things I
[43:51] think about it the it's got an an
[43:53] fragile Spirit to it where the more
[43:54] useful it becomes the more valuable it
[43:56] becomes
[43:58] and most um most networks most
[44:02] Technologies most machines if you want
[44:04] to use more of it it becomes bigger and
[44:08] and more expensive so if you're if
[44:11] you're creating a telecom's network um
[44:14] this is uh there's a law named after
[44:17] someone and I forgotten who it was but
[44:18] if if you create a telecom's network it
[44:21] becomes more expensive to to manage all
[44:24] the different Connections in a
[44:25] centralized manner so the usefulness
[44:28] goes up but the the costs of it like the
[44:30] marginal costs also uh go up and that
[44:33] doesn't happen with Bitcoin it is the
[44:35] way a decentralized network works it
[44:38] doesn't really become any more complex
[44:40] to to run this thing um the code stays
[44:43] the same so as it becomes more useful to
[44:47] people and more people start using it it
[44:49] becomes more valuable both in terms of
[44:51] like the actual price of Bitcoin and the
[44:53] kind of the notional utility of it as a
[44:56] store of value as as a payment method um
[44:59] as a way of you know deriving value from
[45:02] Stranded
[45:03] energy um and you don't get a
[45:06] corresponding increase in in cost or or
[45:09] inefficiency which is incredible so I
[45:13] don't I don't think that's quite what
[45:14] antifragile is but I certainly I know
[45:17] what you mean and yes it has those kind
[45:18] of antifragile properties it to be
[45:21] honest this
[45:22] is my my kind of one belief about
[45:25] Bitcoin that makes me sound a bit crazy
[45:27] it reminds me a little bit of when an
[45:29] animal eats fruit and and spreads the
[45:31] seeds around so you know a plant will
[45:34] grow fruit that is of no particular
[45:36] benefit to itself and an animal will eat
[45:38] it the animal will benefit and then it
[45:40] will spread the seeds around and you get
[45:42] more of the plant that creates more
[45:44] fruit more value to the animals you get
[45:46] more animals etc etc you get this like
[45:49] symbiotic relationship between the fruit
[45:51] bearing plant and the animal and I
[45:54] actually think that's quite a good
[45:55] analogy for Bitcoin like I'm I'm not
[45:57] saying it's life but I'm saying um
[46:01] Technologies don't incentivize their own
[46:03] construction like that there's there's
[46:05] nothing else I can think of that
[46:08] automatically rewards you if if you if
[46:11] you participate or or help it spread the
[46:14] network so that's that's one of the key
[46:17] features of Bitcoin at uh it's not even
[46:20] a key feature of Bitcoin is a key
[46:21] feature of Bitcoin coupled with humans
[46:24] it's something that doesn't exist in one
[46:27] or the other in isolation it's it's a a
[46:29] systematic feature of Bitcoin and I
[46:32] think that's probably the most important
[46:34] properties that that's kind of ATI
[46:35] fragile at a oh a societal
[46:39] level that's why it's so interesting to
[46:41] the thing about like who's aoto was and
[46:45] how how far ahead he thought about those
[46:48] things like how far he thought about the
[46:51] human uh things about already in in in
[46:54] Bitcoin um do you foresee any any system
[46:57] changes uh to bitcoin outside of
[46:59] building ecosystem with layer twos and
[47:02] stuff like that I'm not even going to
[47:04] speculate on that because I'm aware we
[47:05] are so what are we 15 years into it
[47:08] again if you think of like what did
[47:10] computers look at look like 15 years
[47:12] after the invention what the airoplane
[47:14] look like um you probably would have
[47:17] never predicted the the bread and the
[47:19] direction of change kind of similar to
[47:22] how I got into it in 2013 like I don't
[47:25] really know where Bitcoin is going to go
[47:26] but I I think it I think we could see it
[47:28] doing amazing things that you would just
[47:30] never predict I mean like the energy
[47:32] grid thing is one of them um I can't see
[47:36] any failure cases the absolute worst
[47:38] thing I could imagine H happening to it
[47:40] would just be stagnation for a certain
[47:43] period because that has happened with
[47:45] certain things like if if you look at
[47:47] the Space Race and our our progress into
[47:49] space you know it was It was kind of
[47:51] driven by the arms race between um
[47:54] Russia and the USA and
[47:57] uh when the Cold War started coming to
[48:00] an end that incentive disappeared and
[48:02] although you know we did loads of stuff
[48:06] with you know satellites and the space
[48:08] shuttle we didn't really venture out
[48:10] that further into space and it's only
[48:12] just now kind of picking up with things
[48:14] like SpaceX and possible expeditions to
[48:16] Mars so we we basically took I don't
[48:19] know 50 years off of serious space
[48:21] exploration it didn't get worse but we
[48:23] didn't go further the worst I could see
[48:26] happening to bitco would be something
[48:27] like that like to be honest if the Fiat
[48:29] system if we manage to kind of you know
[48:32] broken clock is right twice a day if we
[48:34] manage to hit Upon A coincidental period
[48:37] of stability in the Fiat system I could
[48:39] see Bitcoin maybe not developing that
[48:42] far um during that time I think the
[48:46] probability of that is extremely low
[48:49] it's kind of the bet uh that you're
[48:51] taking against uh the feed currencies
[48:54] and uh it's it's kind of a very simple
[48:57] one if you look at the how the money
[48:59] supply is growing and and how they have
[49:01] to keep growing it to to keep uh issuing
[49:05] and and to keep servicing the dept it's
[49:07] it's kind of a self Runner like the they
[49:10] they can make the the fear currencies
[49:14] for a short period of time good or
[49:17] stable or even a little better but at
[49:20] some point the incentive just gets so
[49:22] strong to print money again it just has
[49:25] to go like the money M2 money has to go
[49:29] up in the long run it's it's almost
[49:31] impossible to to do it otherwise the
[49:34] human incentives just play really nicely
[49:37] in there and yeah if if Bitcoin like if
[49:41] Bitcoin um like I don't think that you
[49:44] have if Bitcoin comes to the world and
[49:46] fixes the money but Bitcoin itself
[49:48] disappears then Bitcoin would also would
[49:51] have succeeded in my way like if if
[49:54] Bitcoin gave and and kind of fixed fat
[49:56] money I don't think that's possible uh I
[49:59] think there's like a 0% CH chance of of
[50:02] getting there but even if that would be
[50:04] the case that would be like a success
[50:07] story for me in my eyes for Bitcoin in
[50:11] in in that sense if you know what I mean
[50:13] so you mean like if if the fact the Fiat
[50:16] system had to compete with Bitcoin made
[50:18] Fiat behave itself yeah yeah that would
[50:22] um I guess it would be
[50:24] nice it would be nice not to need the
[50:27] Lifeboat of Bitcoin yeah that would be I
[50:29] guess that would be the other sort of
[50:31] technical failure case but I I know
[50:33] exactly what you mean it would be a
[50:34] success for for the people of of Earth
[50:37] so yeah absolutely like but obviously
[50:40] there's a bigger and bigger crowd in
[50:42] Bitcoin that wants to have number grb
[50:45] technology they they're in it for the
[50:47] money um uh especially now tread F
[50:51] coming ETFs are coming and stuff like
[50:53] that uh and yeah maybe also be
[50:56] interesting for uh to touch on that a
[50:58] little bit later but uh that that's uh
[51:01] that's kind of like the crowd of like we
[51:02] want number go up technology the people
[51:04] that never uh have their Bitcoin outside
[51:07] of an exchange never outside of the
[51:09] banking app never outside of the ETFs uh
[51:12] they just want to number go up
[51:13] technology maybe they want don't want to
[51:15] even fix the money but they still want
[51:18] to fix the store of value side of things
[51:21] so even that uh is thing but yeah like
[51:24] Bitcoin fixes way more than just
[51:25] inflation like that's a weird argument
[51:27] for me that if because Bitcoin then also
[51:31] has to incentivize the fat currencies to
[51:33] be decentralized and to to be self
[51:35] custodial and stuff like that all right
[51:38] I'm taking that back it was kind of a
[51:40] weird thing weird tangent there but yeah
[51:42] like uh I think definitely uh that that
[51:45] will be interesting how do you um um
[51:48] maybe ETFs and now today there was some
[51:51] tweets going around I don't know if if
[51:53] actually something happened with
[51:54] strategic Bitcoin Reser Reserve
[51:57] [Music]
[51:58] tweeted something uh how do you see the
[52:01] the coming years for Bitcoin and now
[52:04] nation states apparently competing for
[52:07] SATs yeah so do you know I've still not
[52:10] formed an opinion on on things like ETFs
[52:13] some kind of
[52:14] trafi um getting involved I see both
[52:17] sides on on the one hand I see
[52:19] um you know if if they spread if they if
[52:23] they further Bitcoin if they allow you
[52:25] know your youry mom and dad to get
[52:27] involved easily in in a way where
[52:29] they're somewhat protected and it's you
[52:31] know they're less open to scams I see
[52:33] that as a good thing I also see the
[52:35] whole like regulatory capture and kyc
[52:38] and the fact it's um it's almost like
[52:42] you know it's like running an old
[52:44] version of Windows on a new Macbook
[52:47] you're kind of defeating the purpose of
[52:48] it like you're running Fiat on bitcoin
[52:51] um so I get that argument as well and to
[52:54] be honest like I I think it's too early
[52:56] to figure out if it was in aggregate a
[52:59] good decision or a bad decision um
[53:01] certainly it's made you know number go
[53:03] up so it appears to be it appears to be
[53:07] a good decision in the short
[53:08] run um yeah the whole I mean the
[53:12] incentive of of the nation states and
[53:14] the the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve like I
[53:16] see that as fairly inevitable as well
[53:18] and just like you
[53:21] said all nations it's an unstable
[53:24] situation like all nations would have to
[53:26] to abstain from the Strategic Bitcoin
[53:30] Fund in order for this thing to go
[53:32] nowhere and as soon as some one of them
[53:34] breaks and starts acquiring Bitcoin and
[53:36] they start building up their wealth they
[53:38] experience all the benefits of Bitcoin
[53:40] and they start to reduce their exposure
[53:42] to Fiat they experience you know the
[53:45] kind of runaway success of Bitcoin all
[53:47] the other nation states are incentivized
[53:50] to jump on it and jump on it quickly it
[53:51] is it's just a big game theory thing
[53:53] it's the the first person to flinch
[53:57] uh is the person that's going to kick
[53:59] off this this Bitcoin Gold Rush so I do
[54:02] see it as kind of inevitable not you
[54:04] know I don't know that much about global
[54:06] politics but just because it's it's so
[54:08] unstable like I can't see it persisting
[54:10] that way forever so I can't tell you if
[54:12] it's going to be announced today or I
[54:14] know maybe it'll take a lifetime before
[54:16] anyone does anything like that but um
[54:19] you know I do think it'll be sooner
[54:21] rather than later I think what micro
[54:25] strategy is doing
[54:27] is really interesting it's the only
[54:29] thing going on in Bitcoin that scares me
[54:32] and it scares me in a kind of kind of a
[54:34] good way in a bad way because um I don't
[54:36] know if people understand the the
[54:38] convertible bonds and what he's doing at
[54:41] a system level um have you I take it you
[54:45] you've heard of this their their bonds
[54:47] and uh yeah absolutely I don't think I
[54:50] fully crasp what he's doing um and I
[54:54] don't fully crasp with the finances of
[54:57] because I think you really have to study
[54:58] that in in detail but we had multiple
[55:02] podcasts obviously uh you're now
[55:05] 379th uh podcast guests that we had in
[55:08] the last year multiple ones also talking
[55:10] about micro strategy uh but uh I
[55:13] wouldn't be comfortable explaining
[55:16] convertible notes to someone
[55:19] else yeah I mean to be honest nor am I
[55:22] it's more the the systemic level thing
[55:24] so the I think the simple explanation
[55:27] is the idea micro strategy they they
[55:30] take on debt 0% interest and immediately
[55:33] go and buy Bitcoin and um the person
[55:36] that you know bought that bond has the
[55:39] option to convert it to shares at a
[55:40] later date so it's it's sort of like a
[55:43] leveraged investment for them but they
[55:45] also have the option of just saying like
[55:46] hey I I want my my principal back and it
[55:48] was 0% so you know they didn't make any
[55:51] money but it's not that high risk the
[55:53] thing that's really different is there's
[55:55] basically there's no limit to how many
[55:57] times you can do that like if if you're
[55:59] an individual or a company and you want
[56:01] to spend your treasury on bitcoin you
[56:04] will run out of your own money soon
[56:05] enough and you'll have to stop and if
[56:08] you take on debt on which you pay
[56:11] interest there will be some point at
[56:13] which you implode under your own debt
[56:16] like you you can no longer service the
[56:17] interest payments the the revenue you're
[56:19] making from whatever you're doing can't
[56:21] support the debt you're taking on the
[56:23] fact that it's it's 0% debt means he can
[56:27] basically rinse and repeat and kind of
[56:29] do this forever he can just take take
[56:31] people's money and buy Bitcoin and issue
[56:33] shares when you abstract this when you
[56:37] think about the Fiat system and the
[56:38] Bitcoin
[56:39] system uh this is potentially an
[56:43] unlimited bridge between them I almost
[56:46] visualize it
[56:47] as you know if you in a ship and the
[56:51] water is outside and it needs to stay
[56:53] outside for your ship to stay afloat
[56:55] micro strategy is the hole in the ship
[56:58] it's going to
[56:59] allow uh basically Bitcoin to to
[57:02] overwhelm the system and and Fiat to
[57:04] sync so it's it's the conduit of which
[57:07] businesses and individuals could all
[57:10] convert to to bitcoin which is not
[57:12] possible um under the existing kind of
[57:16] interplay between the two systems I
[57:18] don't know if that made sense um but
[57:21] it's the fact that this is It's
[57:23] unlimited you can do it forever it is
[57:25] somewhat reinforcing If he if he buys
[57:29] Bitcoin it pushes the price up that
[57:31] incentivizes more people to do these
[57:33] convertible bonds they become more
[57:35] appealing etc etc posed to feedback loop
[57:38] um it could be that you know it runs out
[57:42] of steam he runs out buyers and
[57:44] satisfies the demand in the market and
[57:46] it becomes just another set of
[57:48] bonds and it doesn't do anything that
[57:51] fundamental to either Bitcoin or to Fiat
[57:54] but because it does have that Runaway
[57:56] potential you know I've seen people
[57:58] refer to it as the singularity like a
[58:00] black hole that sucks sucks everything
[58:01] in it has the potential to basically
[58:04] kill the Fiat system and move us all
[58:06] over to bitcoin I have no idea what the
[58:08] probability of that is I think there's
[58:11] also I mean it as I understand it it's
[58:15] um it's cost positive for existing
[58:18] shareholders like you actually increase
[58:20] the amount of Bitcoin he talks about
[58:21] Bitcoin yield of his shares so it's not
[58:25] like Levering up in the normal way where
[58:28] your upside risk increases and your
[58:30] downside risk increases you know in some
[58:33] proportion um there is a degree of
[58:35] cushioning I haven't I still think it
[58:38] could lead to somewhat of a bubble
[58:40] Behavior where
[58:42] um if it does enter a bit of a feedback
[58:45] loop the price pumps more people buy
[58:46] these bonds
[58:49] um if that tap is turned off does it
[58:52] then bring the price down does that uh
[58:57] yeah well I guess he's only having to
[58:59] repay the principal I haven't figured
[59:00] that out yet but
[59:03] yeah there there's a lot of uh sorry
[59:07] there's a lot of smart people around
[59:09] that topic and what I usually hear is
[59:13] that it's seemingly not a problem um but
[59:17] it's almost seems like a money clitch
[59:19] and I'm always I'm I'm really careful
[59:21] with with those things because usually
[59:23] there are there can be something wrong
[59:26] you said you're scared are you scared
[59:28] for micro strategy or for the FIA
[59:31] system yeah both cuz I I kind of exist
[59:34] in both right like I I own micro
[59:36] strategy but I also like I have a Fiat
[59:39] job
[59:40] um yeah it's the it's the only thing I
[59:44] see going on that has that um that
[59:47] positive feedback loop at the moment
[59:49] like um you know nation states buying
[59:52] Bitcoin people buying increasing amounts
[59:54] of Bitcoin that's a fairly kind of
[59:55] smooth smooth linear situation uh what
[60:00] micro strategy are doing is highly
[60:02] nonlinear and that's what scares me
[60:04] because those are the things they they
[60:06] either produce incredible results or
[60:08] terrible results and those you know
[60:09] they're they're hard to control and they
[60:11] they tend to happen very fast so it
[60:15] scares me in a kind of positive and
[60:16] negative way like it it really excites
[60:18] me to see where it's going to go I think
[60:19] it's an incredibly Brave move um I
[60:24] assume he has a lot of people
[60:26] smarter than me advising him and and
[60:28] knows what he's doing but yeah like you
[60:30] I kind of I kind of see this potential
[60:32] here
[60:33] of if it's an infinite money glitch then
[60:36] it's a black hole for Fiat and it'll
[60:37] destroy Fiat if it's not an infinite
[60:40] money
[60:41] glitch then something could go wrong
[60:44] there and I'm not smart enough to know
[60:47] which one is the
[60:48] case maybe it's also just a a huge
[60:51] repricing going on in in the stock price
[60:55] at some point uh as as I think with most
[60:58] stocks it it will happen because all
[61:00] those stocks have
[61:01] a I mean then he h if if everything
[61:04] reprices uh for Bitcoin he has the
[61:07] advantage of having Bitcoin having the
[61:10] underlying assets so uh it's it's a
[61:13] difficult one I I do
[61:16] see I just think about m strateg in the
[61:20] early days of 2020 uh when he first was
[61:23] on like the first two three podcast and
[61:25] like he said like oh yeah we have like
[61:27] $250 million we're investing in Bitcoin
[61:31] uh and it was like half their uh balance
[61:34] cheet or something like that and now he
[61:36] talks about 42 billion dollar of like
[61:39] convertible n like those numbers got
[61:42] really
[61:43] quickly really big and uh I'm not smart
[61:47] enough to judge if uh that's genius or a
[61:51] bubble like I'm I'm simply don't have
[61:54] the brain capacity to do that currently
[61:58] but yeah like it's it's it's something
[62:00] that we it's something that I'm very um
[62:04] looking forward of like how does Micro
[62:06] strategy look in 20 years like then we
[62:09] know it like in 20 years we we know what
[62:12] kind of a play it is it can go good for
[62:14] like 5 10 years but not in like 25 30
[62:17] years like that that's a time frame you
[62:20] you you kind of see more of the the
[62:22] trend going
[62:23] on yeah for sure for sure um I always
[62:27] think you know someone needs to do it
[62:29] because history is full of people that
[62:32] you know they've ran these crazy
[62:34] experiments they jumped off cliffs to
[62:36] test parachutes they performed surgery
[62:39] on themselves like you you've kind of
[62:42] got to find out find out the hard way so
[62:45] uh I'm really excited to see how it
[62:46] plays out and I I think it needs to be
[62:48] done absolutely uh one more question on
[62:52] the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve front um
[62:54] for a country what do you think is more
[62:58] important having a strategic Bitcoin
[63:00] Reserve or
[63:01] having um Bitcoin Miners and a lot as as
[63:05] many Bitcoin miners as possible in your
[63:08] own country in your jurisdiction like
[63:10] what what play is for a country and a
[63:13] game theory more important going to give
[63:15] you a bit of a a kind of weasly answer I
[63:18] think it depends on your your energy
[63:21] situation because um if you if you have
[63:25] the you know like relatively large
[63:27] amounts of cheap intermittent energy
[63:29] you're much better mining with it and
[63:31] then just keeping the Bitcoins that you
[63:33] mine you build up a strategic Reserve
[63:35] that way uh if you don't have that
[63:38] you're probably better buying and I mean
[63:39] this is bitcoin's backed by energy right
[63:42] and this is the same way that if you are
[63:45] an oil producing Nation you're primly
[63:48] better off producing as much oil as as
[63:50] you can and using it yourself uh at very
[63:52] low cost and you know potentially
[63:54] exporting it to other people if you're
[63:56] not an oil producing country you got to
[63:58] buy it in and and stockpile it so I I
[64:01] see it as the same thing I I see it as
[64:05] linked by abstraction to energy and it
[64:07] depends on on your local access to
[64:10] energy and this is um I think that's
[64:14] potentially really exciting for the UK
[64:17] and and Scotland in particular you know
[64:19] like I said we we have huge amounts of
[64:20] this renewable energy a fair a very
[64:24] large monetary value of It kind of
[64:26] naturally goes to waste just because the
[64:28] how the system is designed there's
[64:31] basically only one thing that can
[64:33] monetize that quantity of energy and
[64:36] it's you know it's far far bigger than
[64:38] anything you could store in in batteries
[64:40] even if we did that at national scale
[64:43] there's uh there's stuff like hydrogen
[64:46] um production although actually there
[64:48] there was a Princeton paper sorry I'm
[64:49] going off on the tangent there was a
[64:51] Princeton paper that was released
[64:52] recently that uh it discussed different
[64:55] options to monetize stranded energy and
[64:57] it looked at creating hydrogen it looked
[64:59] at desalinating seawater if you're one
[65:02] of those countries that has to do that
[65:04] um storing in a battery and it did look
[65:06] at Bitcoin mining and immediately
[65:07] discounted it because it was 100 to a
[65:10] thousand times more lucrative than
[65:12] anything else um and they basically said
[65:15] like it's that no longer becomes a waste
[65:18] product that becomes like a a primary
[65:20] asset for the country so we're going to
[65:22] dismiss it on that basis which to me is
[65:25] a crazy thing to do it's like it's
[65:26] striking gold and saying like oh
[65:28] actually this is too valuable like I was
[65:30] I was looking for trash so I'm just
[65:32] going to throw this away um so I think a
[65:37] a country like the
[65:39] UK it should feel like California did in
[65:43] the 1850s or you know somewhere like
[65:45] Dubai did in the 1960s like uh we have
[65:49] abundant amounts of renewable energy
[65:51] that is cheap it's very cheap if we
[65:53] build the system right at a strategic
[65:55] level it could be less cheap if we get
[65:58] that wrong uh we have waste from that
[66:01] system that we can monetize um I did you
[66:05] know I did a presentation earlier this
[66:06] week I was talking about like if you buy
[66:09] a bottle of coke for say a dollar and
[66:12] you you live in a place where you get 10
[66:13] cents back for the bottle your marginal
[66:15] cost drops to 90 cents what is waste to
[66:19] you the bottle someone else will pay you
[66:21] for it's just an obvious thing that you
[66:22] should be doing and
[66:26] you know you can talk about waste and
[66:27] avoiding waste in the first place but if
[66:29] if you can recycle it if you can find
[66:32] someone that uh that wants that waste
[66:35] and and for them it's not waste it's a
[66:36] it's a source of Revenue that becomes a
[66:39] kind of closed loop system where uh you
[66:42] know arguably there is no waste because
[66:43] you're reusing all the stuff that the
[66:45] primary user didn't need and that's what
[66:48] we could do with with energy in the UK
[66:51] so I think I think the UK should be
[66:54] engaging with mining companies we should
[66:56] be licensing out Bitcoin Farms alongside
[67:00] the licensing we do for renewable
[67:02] projects and we should be build building
[67:04] a strategic Reserve that way I think at
[67:07] the moment we're paying something like
[67:09] 750 million pounds a year for
[67:12] curtailment so that is just that's a
[67:14] complete loss uh to the taxpayer and the
[67:16] bill payer and that's going to rise to
[67:19] something like three or four billion if
[67:21] we're going to you know 3x or a
[67:23] renewable energy and
[67:26] that could turn from a cost into a
[67:28] revenue we could be mining Bitcoin with
[67:30] that so not only would that subsidy
[67:32] would that uh compensation payment
[67:35] disappear but you would have an asset at
[67:38] the end of it because you would be
[67:39] monetizing that waste um if you're a
[67:43] country
[67:44] that uh I you know I don't know a lot
[67:46] about other countries energy scenes but
[67:48] if if you do not have a lot of
[67:50] self-generation of energy then you're
[67:52] probably going to want to uh Buy in the
[67:54] Bitcoin and just focus on a a strategic
[67:58] Reserve that was that was a very
[68:00] roundabout way of answering you I hope
[68:01] that answered your question it it it
[68:03] does um and and gives me one more how is
[68:07] it how is the topic of Bitcoin on a
[68:10] political level currently in the UK we
[68:14] we cover a lot of us obviously and and
[68:17] Trump and that's very loud Topic in in
[68:20] in the US we we hear it here and there
[68:23] of of the EU what they are saying about
[68:25] it and they just want to regulate it to
[68:27] death apparently uh how is the UK
[68:30] looking at Bitcoin on a political level
[68:33] um I I'd summarize by saying it's it's
[68:37] not it's not looking very good we have
[68:41] it tends to be very very up and down
[68:43] dependent on the individual you speak to
[68:45] I mean the previous government made a
[68:48] lot of statements about making the UK a
[68:50] crypto Hub about making us a world
[68:52] leader in uh you know crypto and crypto
[68:56] technology and then you know we've had
[68:59] all this very restrictive legislation a
[69:01] lot of it I would say hinders you know
[69:05] legitimate investors and legitimate
[69:07] businesses and miners much more than it
[69:09] actually protects people from from real
[69:12] harm a lot of it seems to be really
[69:15] backwards and you know BP UK we've had
[69:18] really encouraging engagement with
[69:20] various individuals from government
[69:22] we've you know you get ignored by
[69:25] various other ones so I would say that's
[69:28] kind of reflective of the the Grassroots
[69:30] nature of Bitcoin like it's not
[69:32] happening top down it's happening bottom
[69:34] up bottom up the same way like
[69:36] individuals got interested in Bitcoin
[69:38] and mined in their garage before these
[69:41] big mining companies popped up and I I
[69:43] think it's the same way like individual
[69:45] politicians are becoming more interested
[69:47] and more amable to it but at a policy
[69:51] level we're still seeing I'm not sure
[69:53] I'd call it anti- Bitcoin
[69:56] um but I'd say we're still seeing
[69:59] ineffective regulation or lack of
[70:01] effective regulation which is is really
[70:05] frustrating and it's something my
[70:07] colleagues at BP UK like we we've got an
[70:09] entire policy work stream who are trying
[70:11] to engage with government you know
[70:13] they're they're writing policy documents
[70:15] and policy suggestions trying to kind of
[70:17] get them thinking the right way and you
[70:18] know basically say like look we're here
[70:20] we can help you we know what you're
[70:22] trying to do uh we understand the Spirit
[70:25] of what it is you're trying to do with
[70:27] these regulations but we can tell you
[70:30] what they're actually doing we can tell
[70:31] you the effect and then we can tell you
[70:33] maybe how to better achieve the
[70:36] upsides of of your policies um of your
[70:39] ideologies and and maybe not implement
[70:41] the downsides that we're getting that's
[70:44] uh that's amazing it's great work that
[70:45] you're doing I love that because we have
[70:47] to kind of infiltrate that from all the
[70:50] sides we can possibly can infiltrate
[70:52] that really cool uh ask each and one of
[70:55] my guests one question uh towards the
[70:58] end of the podcast and the question is
[71:00] what can we learn from you besides
[71:01] Bitcoin uh what you can learn for me I'm
[71:04] I'm a deeply boring person so you can
[71:07] learn a lot of engineering stuff from me
[71:11] um amazing engineering facts that
[71:13] probably aren't interesting to other
[71:15] people like uh a lot of the to be honest
[71:19] a lot of the stuff we take for granted
[71:20] around us the fact that it works is a
[71:23] miracle and I guess what this isn't even
[71:27] a fact but what I would say to people
[71:29] when you think about the energy grid and
[71:32] and the modern lives we have and when
[71:33] you think about the the obstacles to
[71:35] bitcoin adoption that we're currently
[71:37] facing I think a lot of people get
[71:39] really pessimistic and they get
[71:41] pessimistic about the state of the world
[71:43] and um the work we have to do on
[71:46] Renewables but I I would point out I
[71:48] mean 150 years ago we would all be
[71:52] fetching water from a wh and the fact
[71:54] that we brought
[71:55] running water into every house and you
[71:58] know sewage pipes to uh to take the
[72:01] sewage away and then we added things
[72:03] like gas I mean you know pressurized gas
[72:06] to the whole country 247 with no
[72:08] interruptions that's incredible and then
[72:10] we did the same for electricity like how
[72:13] often do you get power cuts and the fact
[72:16] that we match supply and demand in real
[72:18] time with fossil fuels you know dug from
[72:22] the Earth's crust and piped across the
[72:24] world and ships across the world and you
[72:26] just flick a light switch and it's
[72:27] seamless and we did telecoms as well and
[72:31] you know delivered petrol or gasoline to
[72:34] petrol stations and everyone drives a
[72:36] car like the scale of the deployment of
[72:39] utilities to every household and
[72:42] business in the developed world is
[72:44] absolutely mindboggling and the fact
[72:46] that any of it works reliably is
[72:48] incredible and I guess I would say to
[72:51] people you know when we think about
[72:52] Renewables and the problems and the
[72:54] intermittency and Bitcoin Fiat System
[72:57] payment networks we have done far more
[73:00] impressive stuff than that in the last
[73:02] couple of centuries there's a lot of
[73:03] work to do but the human race has done
[73:06] far more difficult things and we're
[73:07] we're all enjoying it in our homes right
[73:09] now so I have every confidence that we
[73:11] get there I love that yeah it's uh it's
[73:15] it's it's sometimes when you when you
[73:17] think about things of from an
[73:19] engineering perspective you're like how
[73:21] does this actually work and you dive
[73:23] deeper like oh I'm even more amazed like
[73:26] how does this actually work like like
[73:29] Miracles after Miracles and how far we
[73:31] have come and and what was not possible
[73:34] like 100 years ago and what is now
[73:36] possible uh it's it's kind of amazing
[73:38] yeah really cool um we have end in the
[73:41] podcast we had a pris uh the prisk the
[73:43] previous uh guest asked a question for
[73:45] the next guest without knowing who the
[73:46] next guest is uh question is interesting
[73:49] one uh do we get a strategic Bitcoin
[73:52] Reserve uh in 2095 I guess means America
[73:56] I'm going to I'm going to say yes I
[73:58] don't know what probability I'd assigned
[74:00] it i' I'd maybe say 50/50 but I'm
[74:03] feeling lucky I'm gonna say yes nice
[74:06] perfect and thank you so much Nick for
[74:08] for being on and for taking the time
[74:10] before I let you go uh where can people
[74:11] find you ask your questions and reach
[74:13] out to
[74:14] you uh yeah I'm on Twitter I'm on as
[74:17] Darth pees and I think that's probably
[74:20] the best way to do it uh you can contact
[74:23] BP UK we we have a site and we publish
[74:26] articles on that like I publish stuff on
[74:29] on mining and energy and I've actually
[74:31] got a new paper on uh something cool
[74:33] involving a Caribbean island that I
[74:35] think it should be going up in the next
[74:37] couple of days so check out the the
[74:38] Bitcoin policy UK website and yeah
[74:41] contact me on Twitter thank you so much
[74:44] uh for taking your time thank you so
[74:45] much for everyone that is watching and
[74:48] listening uh for joining us today as
[74:50] always I'll be back tomorrow with
[74:51] another episode bye-bye
