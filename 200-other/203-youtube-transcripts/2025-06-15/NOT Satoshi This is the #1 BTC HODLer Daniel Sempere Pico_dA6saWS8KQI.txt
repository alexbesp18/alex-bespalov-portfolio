[00:00] is the biggest single Bitcoin holder in
[00:01] the world bigger than Satoshi because if
[00:03] he put 10 million in at $10 that's a
[00:06] million Bitcoin way that zapo bank
[00:08] actually started was because he orange
[00:09] pilled all these uh Millionaires and
[00:11] billionaires and they bought Bitcoin
[00:13] throughout 2012 and 2013 as Bitcoin ran
[00:16] up they were like oh this like little
[00:18] bit of money that we've put into Bitcoin
[00:20] is now a lot of money but we don't know
[00:22] how to store this safely can you take
[00:23] care of it for us and Wes had come up
[00:25] with an offline storage solution for
[00:27] himself for his Bitcoin and ended up
[00:29] storing you know all his friends Mike
[00:31] nrat this person that person he orange
[00:33] pilled Reed Hoffman the founder of
[00:35] LinkedIn who then invested in zapo Bank
[00:37] Bill Miller the famous value investor
[00:39] that loves Bitcoin Wes orange pill they
[00:41] were both on stage and Warren Buffett
[00:43] whipped out a T-shirt and gave it to Wes
[00:45] in front of everyone and it said Bitcoin
[00:47] is WRA poison and in 2019 zapo sells
[00:51] that institutional custody business to
[00:53] coinbase and that's why coinbase had the
[00:55] grayscale Bitcoin because it's actually
[00:57] they bought Zappo's institutional
[00:58] custody business so the reason why
[01:00] coinbase has all these Bitcoin now and
[01:02] probably why they have all the most
[01:04] majority of the ETFs go with them is
[01:06] because they bought zappers
[01:07] institutional custody business I didn't
[01:09] tell this part of the story before but
[01:11] his parents lost his life their life
[01:12] savings three times in Argentina when he
[01:14] was growing
[01:18] up I was familiar with Bitcoin gandal
[01:20] before and then I saw this post where
[01:23] you buil like oh not Bitcoin gandal
[01:25] anymore it's now Daniel uh and I loved
[01:27] it so much because this was uh the same
[01:30] day I had a podcast around that topic
[01:32] and he said like oh we bitcoiners should
[01:34] be brave and we should be outgoing and
[01:36] we should not hide in any circumstance
[01:38] and I always say like I respect anyone
[01:40] who does not want to put his identity
[01:43] out there I even had have like I think
[01:45] five or six podcasts where uh the person
[01:48] is not with the name there he's not with
[01:50] a camera it's it's just the voice
[01:52] sometimes even like uh an edited voice
[01:55] so uh I still really like it when
[01:58] someone is brave and and puts himself
[02:00] out there why did you take the step from
[02:03] being anonymous having a really big
[02:06] Channel even like I think it was like
[02:08] 70k or 80k you had on on on Twitter and
[02:11] also newsletter uh and now still being
[02:14] like outspoken and being uh
[02:18] Daniel uh yeah so the
[02:21] my I I think it's it's good to go back
[02:24] first to why I was Anonymous in the
[02:26] first place which I wasn't really I
[02:28] wasn't really Anonymous but
[02:30] I just started this account uh because I
[02:33] wanted to talk about Bitcoin and uh at
[02:37] the time I didn't want to do it under my
[02:39] real name just for for a variety of
[02:42] reasons I won't go into them now but
[02:43] there was a there were reasons like I
[02:45] didn't want people to know that I was
[02:46] into Bitcoin at that
[02:48] time um and also as early days I saw
[02:52] that uh you know Bitcoin Twitter is
[02:53] there's a lot of ship posting going on
[02:56] so I was like I can be a bit more
[02:57] liberal with some ship posting as well
[03:00] uh anonymously right you might do things
[03:02] not under your real name that you
[03:04] wouldn't do under your real name but
[03:05] anyway it was mainly just so I could
[03:06] indulge in the obsession of Bitcoin uh
[03:10] not under my real name and then I never
[03:13] imagined that I would end up working in
[03:15] Bitcoin or that like a lot of people
[03:17] would follow me and be interested in
[03:19] what I had to say I still sometimes
[03:21] can't don't understand why that is but
[03:24] um yeah just one day as I started
[03:26] working in Bitcoin I wasn't being
[03:28] anonymous in person like I wouldn't post
[03:30] photos of myself online um but you know
[03:34] I would meet people and I would tell
[03:35] them who I was pretty much if I knew
[03:37] they were in Bitcoin and on Twitter I
[03:39] would tell them uh who I was especially
[03:41] because like if I went up to someone and
[03:43] introduced myself as Daniel they're like
[03:45] yeah whatever but if I was like oh I'm
[03:46] gandal they're like oh we've talked on
[03:48] Twitter or I follow you or there was
[03:49] like some more connection there right so
[03:52] at the point I'm at
[03:55] now I figured there's no point in having
[03:57] this like Alter Ego uh because I'm not
[03:59] being anonymous and it's kind of like
[04:02] difficult to have two personalities like
[04:04] my real name and my real face and then
[04:06] this this Alter Ego um and I kind of
[04:09] want to reach out like now that I'm so I
[04:12] used to work at brains and marketing but
[04:16] I left there at the end of last year to
[04:17] do my own thing and I want to focus on
[04:21] sharing the Bitcoin story right and I
[04:25] want to reach outside of the echo
[04:26] chamber outside of the bubble and I
[04:28] think I'll be more effective under using
[04:31] my real face and name than being some
[04:34] random wizard you know Anon person on I
[04:37] think people out people inside of
[04:38] Bitcoin are very receptive to that but
[04:41] outside of Bitcoin newbies they might be
[04:43] put off by it they might not take you
[04:46] seriously you need a face to it like I I
[04:49] saw it um when I was not putting out
[04:51] videos and I was just putting twitters
[04:54] out I was it was really good contrast
[04:56] for me last year in Prague nobody knew
[04:58] me I was [ __ ] posting every day I had a
[05:01] small account with like I don't know
[05:03] 7,000 followers or something like that
[05:05] like that that and nobody knew me and
[05:08] now I'm putting out a video every day uh
[05:11] and I know knew so so many people
[05:13] because then all of the sudden you have
[05:14] a face you have a recognized you see
[05:16] them when you they're walking by and you
[05:18] have a such a way better way to to
[05:21] connect to people I love it a lot when
[05:23] you you put your face out there it has
[05:25] this downsizes you you have a little bit
[05:27] more risk on privacy you have a little
[05:29] bit more risk on on security uh but I
[05:33] myself was like H I want to do it I also
[05:35] put the the uh my decision like I want
[05:38] to be deep in the Bitcoin community and
[05:39] I want to put my face onto the Bitcoin
[05:42] Community um a little bit earlier than
[05:44] you and I'm not that far uh ahead in you
[05:47] like you you how long you in Bitcoin and
[05:50] working in
[05:51] there uh I started well like I got I
[05:55] became like let's say orange pilled or
[05:57] obsessed and at the end of 2020 and I
[06:00] started working at brains in the middle
[06:01] of 2021 like July 2021 so just over
[06:04] three
[06:06] years so you're really three years
[06:09] working but you really quickly then
[06:11] became from like a orange build and get
[06:15] Bitcoin to like I'm actually also
[06:16] working in Bitcoin how was how did you
[06:18] this came together uh yes so I I I used
[06:23] to have a business in real estate um
[06:25] with a business partner and I was in the
[06:28] process of exiting that business when I
[06:29] discovered Bitcoin so it was uh it was a
[06:32] it was already like a pivotal moment in
[06:34] my like professional career I already
[06:36] knew I wanted to get out of doing real
[06:38] estate and do something else I wanted to
[06:40] do something on the Internet since like
[06:42] 2016 when I was like using social media
[06:45] to push my real estate business I was
[06:47] like okay I want to do something in the
[06:49] in the digital world whether it's like
[06:50] Media or software uh that's like what
[06:53] that's where I want to go next um
[06:55] because real estate is like a very
[06:56] physical thing I have to be like present
[06:58] in the city I have to go to a lot of
[06:59] physical appointments right so I wanted
[07:02] to do something that was that was
[07:04] scalable digitally uh so it just
[07:07] happened it just so happened that I came
[07:08] across Bitcoin at a time when I was in
[07:10] the process of exiting this business uh
[07:13] and then so I had nothing to do and this
[07:15] a I saw brains post for a social media
[07:18] marketing intern and I was like well I
[07:20] spend 12 hours a day on Twitter talking
[07:22] about Bitcoin so might as well go and do
[07:24] it for
[07:25] brains yeah definitely you can you can
[07:28] get uh paid for for [ __ ] posting on
[07:30] Twitter these days exactly exactly and
[07:32] then they started sending me to
[07:34] conferences uh you know the role grew
[07:36] because I did start off as an
[07:38] intern but like I'm 3 I was like 33 or
[07:42] 34 years old um already with like a
[07:47] decade career in real estate but was
[07:49] willing to start again from the bottom
[07:51] because I knew was like okay I I really
[07:53] enjoy Bitcoin I would love to do this
[07:55] for the next like 10 20 30 years of my
[07:58] life
[07:59] this takes a lot of uh openness and a
[08:02] lot of like because when you have a
[08:04] decade career uh especially if you if
[08:07] you like it I don't know if how much you
[08:09] like the real estate business but if you
[08:10] kind of liked it and then you have a
[08:12] decade career then you're like oh I want
[08:14] to be completely something new and and
[08:16] real estate and Bitcoin is like it's
[08:18] it's similar but there's whole new group
[08:21] and a whole new community it takes a lot
[08:23] of Courage also to like reinvent
[08:25] yourself uh with over 30 I feel like
[08:29] I yeah I didn't feel like I I didn't
[08:31] feel like I was being courageous it just
[08:33] felt like I was pursuing my
[08:34] interests so it wasn't like I wasn't
[08:37] like scared or
[08:39] anything and and I H you know I have
[08:42] faith that whatever whatever you put
[08:44] your mind to you can achieve right if
[08:46] it's a case like going into a new
[08:48] industry is a case of getting to know
[08:49] the people acquiring some knowledge and
[08:52] some skills and that's with the internet
[08:55] that's more you know you need time right
[08:57] I was fortunate that I had the time that
[08:59] I could have invest into doing that but
[09:01] you know with the internet these days
[09:03] you can learn anything you can meet
[09:04] anyone so I wasn't necessar I didn't
[09:07] feel courageous although I you know I
[09:09] can see how that you know you can look
[09:11] at it that way I've got I we were in the
[09:14] process of also moving country so I grew
[09:16] I lived most of my life in Hong Kong I
[09:18] lived there for 25 years and it was
[09:20] around the same time as well that I was
[09:22] moving my wife and I were moving to live
[09:25] in the UK and Scotland and I was about
[09:27] to have my first child as well so it was
[09:29] just like a period of completely
[09:31] changing everything you know starting a
[09:34] family moving to a different country and
[09:36] changing careers not I don't recommend
[09:39] doing it all at the same
[09:42] time the the same thing uh or should I
[09:45] forgot the name CTO of relay uh Adam
[09:49] yeah Adam Ban yes Adam bellan he he also
[09:53] started really uh in I think the same
[09:56] month even when he got his first uh F
[09:59] first son he also did the he gave the
[10:03] same advice don't don't do it if you
[10:05] can I repeated the mistake because uh we
[10:09] moved I just moved to Dubai and and also
[10:12] left brains at the same time to start
[10:14] doing my own
[10:16] thing so I I've done it TW twice
[10:20] now maybe there's a third time let's see
[10:24] no more no more no more I'm not moving
[10:27] yeah then today's topic uh you you
[10:29] suggested it in the beginning and I I
[10:31] loved it a lot um I did not knew that
[10:34] that man but he seems really interesting
[10:36] and and this is I think when when I
[10:39] don't know him there's probably a lot of
[10:40] other people in the Bitcoin community
[10:42] that not aw are not aware of him uh that
[10:45] he orange build a lot of interesting
[10:46] people and uh and he has a really unique
[10:49] way of of explaining people um first off
[10:52] uh I I already don't know again how to
[10:55] pronounce his name but it's the the
[10:58] founder
[11:00] yeah it's w Wes casades if you want to
[11:03] say it in Spanish it's Wes La casades is
[11:06] his whole name but Wes is what you know
[11:09] people call how people pronounce it in
[11:10] English it's very similar to
[11:14] W in uh
[11:16] German no no no the English word for
[11:18] Wednesday like Wednesday oh Wednesday
[11:20] yeah yeah yeah yeah and so like um what
[11:24] what did he do and and why is he
[11:25] interesting for you and you're writing a
[11:27] book about him right yeah so um when so
[11:32] I'll give you a little bit of context of
[11:33] how I even got to that so when I left
[11:35] brains at the end of last year I knew I
[11:38] wanted to double down like the things
[11:40] that were going personally well for me
[11:41] in the Bitcoin space is obviously like
[11:43] Twitter I felt like was an area to
[11:45] double down and then in terms of media
[11:48] the you know Twitter is a written medium
[11:51] so I was like I'm going to double down
[11:53] on writing on Twitter right and just
[11:55] trying to find topics to write about I
[11:58] realized I I I I challenged myself I did
[12:01] this course and I was the the part of
[12:03] the course was like you had to write
[12:04] every day right so every day I was like
[12:07] scrambling for something to think about
[12:09] to write about on Twitter and uh I
[12:13] started writing stories about things
[12:14] that have happened in Bitcoin or about
[12:16] people basically events and people in
[12:18] bitcoin's history right and these seem
[12:21] to get a lot of interest like people
[12:22] were really liking them I was getting a
[12:24] lot of retweets a lot of likes a lot of
[12:25] good feedback um and so my plan was like
[12:28] well okay I'm going to write a book of
[12:29] short stories uh of course I was going
[12:31] to make it you know 21 short stories so
[12:33] I'm there looking for stories to to put
[12:36] in this book and I remember that in 2015
[12:40] there was like uh it was all over the
[12:42] mainstream news that there was this
[12:44] bitcoin's Fort Knox right there was
[12:47] these there was some some Bank was
[12:50] storing hundreds of thousands of
[12:52] Bitcoins in Swiss military bunkers under
[12:56] the Swiss Alps and so I I was like
[12:58] that's probably this prob a cool story
[13:00] behind there so I started researching it
[13:03] and that's when I uh came across Wes I'd
[13:07] already heard of Wes and I remember that
[13:09] he was like the founder of zapo bank but
[13:11] I didn't know how important he had been
[13:14] to in the Bitcoin space back in the
[13:16] early days so um so in researching for
[13:21] this short story book I came across him
[13:24] his life story is so incredible that I
[13:26] was like okay A a book needs to be
[13:28] written about about his life because
[13:30] it's insane right uh so I just went down
[13:33] a rabbit hole of of researching every
[13:36] piece of content every news article just
[13:38] everything that exists in the world
[13:40] about him I've got like cataloged and
[13:44] and researched um but yeah he he was in
[13:47] so he grew up in I don't know if you
[13:49] know a place called Patagonia in
[13:52] Argentina it's like the B it's like the
[13:55] bottom of Argentina the very so the the
[13:57] southern part of Argentina it's like
[13:59] Barren winter desert so that but it's
[14:02] beautiful it's like mountains lakes but
[14:04] it gets super cold and it's very
[14:05] isolated he grew up on a sheep farm
[14:08] there so his parents are sheep ranchers
[14:11] um his mom was entrepreneurial and his
[14:14] dad was actually like uh obsessed with
[14:16] building his own radios and computers so
[14:19] he got this like Tech entrepreneurial
[14:22] streak from his parents and when he went
[14:24] to University in 1994 he uh tried the
[14:28] internet for the first time and ended up
[14:30] starting the first ever internet service
[14:32] provider in
[14:35] Argentina uh and then anyway yeah he he
[14:38] got rug pulled by his business partner
[14:40] ended up with nothing and then started
[14:42] but he saw the power of the internet so
[14:45] he doubled down and he started Latin
[14:47] America's first uh online Brokerage in
[14:51] like
[14:51] 1996 and he sold that to Bano Santander
[14:55] for more than half a uh more than 500
[14:58] million
[14:59] and just before the bubble so he is this
[15:03] is all before
[15:05] Bitcoin so he is a you know
[15:07] entrepreneurial and Rich before he
[15:10] discovers Bitcoin in
[15:13] 2011 so the the reason how he came
[15:16] across Bitcoin was that he goes on these
[15:19] like road trips him and his friends own
[15:21] this old school bus and they go on road
[15:24] trips around South America in it once a
[15:26] year and this particular year 2011 and
[15:29] his friends they they needed to repair
[15:30] the bus so he was living in in San
[15:33] Francisco in Silicon Valley and his
[15:35] friend calls him and says hey we need
[15:37] you to send us you know x amount few
[15:39] hundred dollars or a thousand dollars uh
[15:41] for your share of the bus repairs and at
[15:44] the time Argentina had all these Capital
[15:46] controls so there was no PayPal there's
[15:47] no Western Union you can't do a bank
[15:49] transfer into the country there's only
[15:51] like one there's only one way to send
[15:53] money into the country is via the
[15:54] Central Bank you had to fill out a bunch
[15:56] of paperwork send the money to the
[15:58] central bank they would convert it into
[16:00] the local currency at whatever exchange
[16:02] rate they felt like doing and he was
[16:04] like it's just too much hassle for the
[16:06] amount of money that I had to send and
[16:08] then he said one of his
[16:09] friends suggested that said he'd heard
[16:12] about this like internet money thing
[16:14] called Bitcoin and said why don't you
[16:16] use that you know you can it's it allows
[16:17] you to send money anywhere in the world
[16:19] without anyone's permission and Wes
[16:21] being a tech a a financial Tech
[16:24] entrepreneur was like you don't know
[16:27] anything about tech or Finance I know
[16:31] everything about tech and finance I've
[16:32] never heard of this Bitcoin thing so it
[16:34] must be like he was immediately
[16:35] skeptical right his friend like who knew
[16:37] nothing so but anyway but he looks into
[16:40] it uh so he starts doing some research
[16:42] about Bitcoin and he finds a guy on
[16:44] Craigslist that's willing to sell him
[16:47] $22,000 worth of bitcoin in person
[16:49] peer-to-peer right and this is when
[16:51] Bitcoin is like $3 or something so they
[16:54] arranged to meet at a cafe in Palo Alto
[16:56] in in California San Francisco
[16:59] um and he walks in there and he said the
[17:01] guy is like a old like a old 50-year-old
[17:04] guy with like a white beard and long
[17:06] white hair and he says he looks like
[17:08] Gandalf yeah and uh so uh Gandalf gets
[17:13] him to download you know a Bitcoin
[17:15] wallet he scans a QR code you know Wes
[17:18] gives him the gives him $2,000 and the
[17:20] guy says okay I've sent you the Bitcoin
[17:22] and Wes leaves the coffee shop convinced
[17:25] that he's been scammed out of
[17:27] $2,000 but he does what his friend said
[17:30] and sends the Bitcoin over to his friend
[17:32] in Argentina and a few hours later his
[17:35] friend calls him and says hey Wes I've
[17:37] got the money your part is all settled
[17:40] for the bus repairs and Wes is like what
[17:43] the hell just
[17:44] happened yeah so he's like
[17:47] shocked so he starts researching Bitcoin
[17:50] going down the proverbial Rabbit Hole he
[17:52] even hires a team of hackers he he pays
[17:56] a team of hackers $250,000
[17:59] to spend three months trying to break
[18:01] Bitcoin find bugs hack a wallet etc etc
[18:05] and the team of hackers comes back to
[18:06] him but in the meantime also he's like
[18:08] flying around the US meeting with anyone
[18:11] that he knows that knows about Bitcoin
[18:13] to try and learn he's reading everything
[18:16] he can about Bitcoin but you know 2011
[18:17] is probably like Bitcoin talk forums and
[18:20] you know maybe he met a few of the early
[18:22] ogs that were uh in Bitcoin back
[18:25] then um but yeah this team of hackers
[18:28] after 3 months they come back to Wes and
[18:31] say uh we haven't been able to break
[18:34] Bitcoin but we'd love to keep trying for
[18:36] another few months because we think
[18:38] maybe we can we can do something but we
[18:39] just need more time uh and then so
[18:42] they're like w is like okay how much
[18:43] time do you need and they're like oh we
[18:45] want another three months and then and
[18:46] they're like and we want another
[18:48] $150,000 but we want to get paid in
[18:51] Bitcoin and that's when he's like okay
[18:54] you know shuts it all he's like by this
[18:55] time he's convinced okay there's
[18:57] something here and in
[19:00] 2012 he is putting tens of millions of
[19:03] dollars into Bitcoin this is when bit
[19:06] like Bitcoin in 2012 is traded between
[19:09] like seven and
[19:11] $13 so I yeah I've seen this mention on
[19:14] Twitter some people think that he's the
[19:16] biggest single Bitcoin holder in the
[19:18] world bigger than Satoshi because if he
[19:20] put 10 million in at $10 that's a
[19:22] million
[19:24] Bitcoin right and and this is the part
[19:28] of his story is in a book called digital
[19:30] gold I'm not sure if you've ever read it
[19:31] but it's very good it's it's about like
[19:33] yeah it's a story from the beginning of
[19:34] Bitcoin to about 2013 and Wes is in a
[19:38] character in that book a lot uh and
[19:40] that's where it says that he's
[19:42] throughout 2012 he puts up to 10% of his
[19:44] net worth tens of millions of dollars
[19:46] into Bitcoin and so if you just go
[19:49] conservative if you if you take the
[19:51] middle price of 2012 which is around $10
[19:54] and you go conservative and just say he
[19:56] bought $10 million worth that's a
[19:57] million Bitcoin and he's likely that he
[20:00] bought more than that so he probably has
[20:01] more than a million I've seen videos of
[20:03] him in 2021 saying he is buying more so
[20:06] imagine somebody who bought Bitcoin at
[20:08] $3 buying more at
[20:11] $45,000 or whatever whatever it was back
[20:14] then and it was like April 2021 so maybe
[20:18] it was like
[20:19] 45k and he's still buying more that's an
[20:22] amazing story already yeah I mean he so
[20:25] because he was a successful uh sort of
[20:28] early internet entrepreneur he had he
[20:32] had a lot of VC investors in his company
[20:34] that he sold for $500 million so and he
[20:37] had other he did other business other
[20:39] other startups as well like he did an
[20:41] online bank in Brazil in the early 2000s
[20:44] he did one of the first apps that
[20:46] allowed you to like put your cards on a
[20:48] mobile wallet and pay with them like
[20:49] your you know your regular debit and
[20:51] credit
[20:52] card so he was very well connected in
[20:55] Silicon Valley Wall Street with like
[20:57] hedge fund managers and VCS and so when
[21:00] he got obsessed with Bitcoin of course
[21:02] he was going around telling everyone
[21:04] about Bitcoin and he got them all into
[21:07] it as well and the way that zapo bank
[21:09] actually started was uh because he
[21:12] orange pilled all these uh Millionaires
[21:14] and billionaires and they bought Bitcoin
[21:16] throughout 2012 and
[21:19] 2013 as Bitcoin ran up they were like oh
[21:23] this like little bit of money that we've
[21:24] put into Bitcoin is now a lot of money
[21:27] but we don't know how to store safely
[21:29] can you take care of it for us and Wes
[21:31] had come up with an offline storage
[21:33] solution for himself for his
[21:36] Bitcoin and ended up storing you know
[21:38] all his friends Mike nrat this person
[21:40] that person he orange pilled Reed
[21:42] Hoffman the founder of linkon who then
[21:44] invested in zapo Bank Bill Miller the
[21:47] famous value investor that loves Bitcoin
[21:50] Wes orange pilled him he even orange
[21:52] pilled Bill Gates although Bill Gates
[21:54] later changed his mind about Bitcoin
[21:57] because of Warren Buffett but when say
[21:58] Wes has even met I wrote a story in my
[22:01] newsletter uh about the time when Wes
[22:03] met Warren Buffett to teach him about
[22:08] Bitcoin yeah so
[22:10] anyway it didn't go
[22:12] well it didn't go well he he says you
[22:15] Warren Buffett just believes in you know
[22:17] productive assets uh so yeah he doesn't
[22:21] understand he doesn't he doesn't get the
[22:23] the he thinks like gold is just like a
[22:25] pet rock that does nothing he doesn't I
[22:27] guess he doesn't get the like money side
[22:29] of it uh he just looks at it as like is
[22:31] this making me cash flow and is this
[22:33] like contributing to society in some way
[22:36] uh which is fair enough I mean look at
[22:38] yeah just War Warren Buffett is goes for
[22:41] what's worked for him which makes
[22:42] perfect sense but he says that um at a
[22:45] conference they were both on stage and
[22:46] Warren Buffett whipped out a T-shirt and
[22:48] gave it to Wes in front of everyone and
[22:50] it said Bitcoin is WRA
[22:53] poisoned oh yeah yeah yeah nice but yeah
[22:58] so anyway storing all these Bitcoin he's
[23:00] like okay there's some there's obviously
[23:02] demand for you know Bitcoin custody so
[23:05] he starts zapo bank and zapo that zapo
[23:08] bank ends up being the largest custodian
[23:10] of Bitcoin in the world they custody the
[23:13] grayscale Bitcoin fund they custody uh
[23:17] Bitcoin from like Canadian and European
[23:20] funds as well that existed before the
[23:22] ETFs and in
[23:24] 2019 zapo sells that institutional
[23:28] custody business to coinbase and that's
[23:30] why coinbase had the grayscale Bitcoin
[23:33] because it's actually they bought
[23:34] Zappo's institutional custody business
[23:36] so the reason why coinbase has all these
[23:39] Bitcoin now and probably why they have
[23:41] all the most majority of the ETFs go
[23:43] with them is because they bought Zappa's
[23:45] institutional custody
[23:47] business that's an amazing origin story
[23:50] I like I have every day a Bitcoin on and
[23:52] I never heard that yeah I mean he's he's
[23:56] he's insane you can if you hug his name
[23:59] he has he's got he's been on a few
[24:00] podcasts and he's got a lot of stories
[24:02] he tells he has a he has a talk that
[24:05] people like which is sort of explains
[24:08] what money is and then goes through to
[24:10] why Bitcoin is the best form it's like
[24:12] the bullish case for Bitcoin before the
[24:14] bullish case for Bitcoin kind of
[24:17] thing and you also said uh that he has a
[24:20] unique way of explaining uh Bitcoin and
[24:24] I think you you want to write even two
[24:26] books about him the first is like how he
[24:28] explains Bitcoin and the other one was
[24:31] the the biography about him yeah the the
[24:33] so the one the one where so I want to
[24:37] frame
[24:38] the I thought about how I got into
[24:41] Bitcoin right and how what made me pay
[24:43] attention to it and for me it
[24:46] was someone that I looked up to admired
[24:49] and respected told me about
[24:52] Bitcoin before that when I heard about
[24:55] it I just completely dismissed it but
[24:57] once somebody that I that I respected
[24:59] told me about it that I thought oh this
[25:01] guy is smart if he's saying that I
[25:04] should look at it then there must be
[25:06] something there for me to look at and so
[25:08] I want to frame the sort of selling or
[25:13] explaining Bitcoin from like using his
[25:16] credibility because he's had such an
[25:18] incredible career he's obviously very
[25:20] smart and he's obviously able to explain
[25:21] it in it but so what's it's maybe not so
[25:25] unique now but it's the fact that he
[25:27] framed it as like why it's good money
[25:30] right and he was also able I guess back
[25:34] then it just wasn't as as now there's so
[25:37] much Bitcoin content and we all know the
[25:39] the narratives and why it's valuable and
[25:41] all that stuff but back then the way he
[25:44] was explaining it was revolutionary
[25:45] nobody very few people could understand
[25:48] it that way so the fact that it was like
[25:52] complete that nobody controlled it right
[25:54] that was he he called it s he called it
[25:56] like Sovereign money Sovereign as in
[25:59] like it was your you nobody else could
[26:01] control it only nobody else could stop
[26:03] you from sending money anywhere in the
[26:05] world he was also heavily driven I
[26:09] didn't tell this part of the story
[26:10] before but his parents lost his life
[26:12] their life savings three times in
[26:13] Argentina when he was growing up so he
[26:16] also felt at first that the internet
[26:18] would give greater access to financial
[26:21] assets and services for uh poorer people
[26:24] so that they wouldn't have to be Expos
[26:26] you know they wouldn't be exposed to
[26:29] I guess like if you own some real estate
[26:30] you're sort of protected by
[26:33] hyperinflation or if you own some assets
[26:34] you're protected from from
[26:36] hyperinflation uh but his parents didn't
[26:39] have that and then he became
[26:40] disillusioned with the internet thinking
[26:43] it's actually not doing what I thought
[26:45] it would do uh for financial inclusivity
[26:48] and then when he discovered Bitcoin his
[26:50] hope for that was renewed because he's
[26:51] like oh maybe this is the thing that
[26:54] that can help people like my parents
[26:56] protect their wealth which is true but
[26:59] we're still so early that people don't
[27:01] don't understand it most people yeah
[27:05] it's definitely it's it's it's like when
[27:06] we are going the in the outside of our
[27:10] Bitcoin bubble outside of our uh small
[27:13] little comfortable uh conferences we
[27:16] were Bitcoin brag and all this uh then
[27:19] it's like oh yeah people don't
[27:21] understand what money is people don't
[27:22] understand what Bitcoin is and you
[27:24] really have to explain this like we
[27:25] really have to educate people yeah I
[27:28] mean I don't blame them uh I didn't know
[27:30] what money I did my degree my University
[27:32] degree was economics of money Banking
[27:34] and finance and I did not they did not
[27:36] explain what money was to
[27:38] me I did my uh my University
[27:42] dissertation uh on Silver but I did it
[27:46] on Silver as an industrial medal you
[27:50] know also as money but the thesis was
[27:53] saying that like as more as as the as
[27:56] the world shifts to more towards more
[27:58] like electronics and Technology those
[28:01] things all require silver in them and
[28:03] that's why silver price is going to pump
[28:05] not because of its monetary value but
[28:07] because of its industrial demand use and
[28:10] this was in 2011 I I looked back through
[28:12] it the other day to see if I've
[28:14] mentioned Bitcoin in it but I didn't
[28:16] thank you you already made it halfway
[28:18] through the video and I'm really really
[28:20] grateful to have you here two things
[28:22] make this channel possible you as a
[28:24] watcher and listener who keep supporting
[28:27] this Channel and another one is all the
[28:29] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[28:31] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[28:34] very start and where I personally buy my
[28:36] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[28:38] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[28:40] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[28:43] simplest and securest way to secure your
[28:47] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[28:49] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[28:52] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[28:54] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[28:57] two % bracket and if you have self-
[29:00] custody and you know your friend does
[29:01] not have maybe he needs a Christmas
[29:03] present maybe he needs a birthday
[29:04] present and a small life hack if you use
[29:07] code Robin you get 5% off your order
[29:10] plus you support my channel and now
[29:13] let's get back to the video it's
[29:14] interesting uh do you think that it's
[29:17] important for us to be uh out there and
[29:20] and talking about Bitcoin uh because
[29:23] sometimes I have the feeling Bitcoin
[29:25] does does what it does anyways it
[29:27] doesn't need me uh and I can just like
[29:29] shut up about it but then I see all
[29:31] those people in my environment and I
[29:33] really want to educate I I want to be
[29:36] there for them I want to be that uh
[29:39] person that they can call at like 11: pm
[29:41] and say like oh can you explain me
[29:43] Bitcoin and I'm will be sitting there
[29:44] with them till 4 a.m. so they understand
[29:46] that if they're willing to learn it so
[29:48] some thinking like why do we have those
[29:51] massive Drive in us um to to explain and
[29:55] educate other peop about Bitcoin even
[29:57] though we don't really need it because
[29:59] when we are honest with us uh if if if
[30:02] I'm not around anymore Bitcoin doesn't
[30:04] change it like lot not even like a
[30:06] Michael Cen not even the really big uh
[30:08] people they they might be might be
[30:11] interesting what happens then but even
[30:14] like even El musk did not had a huge
[30:16] impact after his first impact like he
[30:19] had this Major Impact before when he
[30:21] bought and then he said [ __ ] about it
[30:24] but afterwards he did not even had an
[30:26] impact on the network and he the riches
[30:28] do uh right now on Earth so I feel like
[30:31] we we don't have really an impact in
[30:33] Bitcoin but at the same time um we
[30:36] really want to have an impact we really
[30:38] want to contribute to to bitcoin uh do
[30:41] do we need to I guess my question is
[30:44] like do we need to be there in in
[30:46] Bitcoin or is it something that is just
[30:48] naturally coming no I think Bitcoin is
[30:51] nothing without the social layer right
[30:53] Bitcoin needs people to use it to for it
[30:56] to be worth something and for it to be
[30:58] useful if it just sits there no one runs
[31:00] a node no one uses Bitcoin no one talks
[31:02] about Bitcoin it's just some code on a
[31:05] computer right so it definitely Bitcoin
[31:09] needs the
[31:10] people uh but yeah you could argue is
[31:15] there any one person or small group of
[31:17] people that are that important to
[31:19] bitcoin to the point where like if
[31:20] they're not involved in it or not
[31:22] talking about it that Bitcoin goes away
[31:24] I don't think so we've gone I think
[31:26] we've gotten past that point where
[31:28] uh any one person or entity has a
[31:32] massive massive amount of influence
[31:35] over the Bitcoin as in like Bitcoin the
[31:38] network but I mean you know if sailor
[31:40] turned around tomorrow and said I'm
[31:42] selling all my Bitcoin that would
[31:43] definitely have an impact on the market
[31:44] on the price right so there there are
[31:48] concentrations of influence to some
[31:51] aspects of Bitcoin like the price if
[31:53] Michael sailor was to sell right if a
[31:55] lot of people are are in it because
[31:58] sailor sold them on
[31:59] it and but they're not that convinced
[32:03] themselves and then sailor sells those
[32:05] people are probably also going to sell
[32:07] if they're just following someone right
[32:10] um when it comes to like why do we want
[32:12] to teach other people about Bitcoin I I
[32:16] don't know I mean I'll speak personally
[32:18] I just I I like Bitcoin so I like
[32:21] talking about it not necessarily
[32:23] teaching but of course when somebody
[32:25] shows an interest in something that
[32:26] you're interested in especially if they
[32:28] don't know the conversation just goes
[32:29] towards that you know you have to
[32:31] explain how it works to someone before
[32:33] you can sort of have a conversation with
[32:35] them about it I'm not like
[32:38] outwardly I don't go around thinking I'm
[32:42] gonna teach all these people about
[32:43] Bitcoin it's more about like
[32:46] uh it's it's more about the the fact
[32:49] that I do it because I enjoy it and I
[32:51] just put it out into the world and if
[32:53] other people get some use out of it then
[32:55] fantastic but I'm not constantly
[32:57] thinking about like how can I do a
[32:58] better job to educate other people or
[33:00] like how can I you know how can I reach
[33:03] more people I mean yes I do think about
[33:05] how I can reach more people actually but
[33:07] it comes from like I do it because I
[33:09] enjoy it rather than like the extrinsic
[33:12] I want to teach people
[33:14] Bitcoin yeah sometimes I feel like um
[33:17] outside of Bitcoin when we look at the
[33:19] crypto space they even do sometimes a
[33:22] really good job in marketing their
[33:24] tokens their their projects uh and and
[33:27] Bitcoin because we don't have like this
[33:29] organized thing everyone does his own
[33:32] thing of course they're like uh some
[33:34] just some decentralized organizations
[33:37] where they're like oh yeah we we want to
[33:39] promote Bitcoin we want to promote here
[33:42] but there's no like
[33:43] real um like there's no one in Bitcoin
[33:46] that holds all the strings and like says
[33:48] oh on all the podcasts we're talking
[33:50] about this now this is the beauty of it
[33:52] uh but feel like this also um the makes
[33:56] the whole process a little bit uh slow
[33:58] of the
[33:59] adoption yeah I mean we don't have like
[34:01] if you think about the pillars of like
[34:04] human desire it's like health wealth
[34:07] relationships maybe so like you know
[34:10] crypto tokens they're selling you on
[34:12] wealth buy my token get rich tomorrow or
[34:16] you know it's gonna they're always
[34:18] trying to sell the Bitcoin story right
[34:22] Bitcoin did so well and in some years
[34:26] very well very quickly you know you
[34:27] bought Bitcoin at $3 in 2011 and it was
[34:31] $1,200 or $1,300 two years later right
[34:35] that return is insane I think
[34:38] all uh cryptocurrencies
[34:41] are piggybacking off that performance
[34:44] and that success and trying to sell you
[34:46] that they're going to be the next one to
[34:48] do that they're the next big thing but
[34:51] there is no next big thing right Bitcoin
[34:54] is the next big thing did you uh vent to
[34:58] altcoins uh at some point very very
[35:01] briefly when I like so when I got into
[35:04] Bitcoin I was lucky that
[35:06] like I understood that you don't un like
[35:10] it's very hard to unseat the Top Dog
[35:13] it's like I'm not going to launch
[35:14] another mobile phone company and and say
[35:17] I'm gonna come in here I'm G to be the
[35:18] next apple right what do I think is more
[35:21] likely that Apple sells more iPhones 10
[35:23] years from now than they do today or
[35:25] that somebody else is going to come in
[35:27] and be the next Apple I would bet that
[35:29] apple in 10 years is still the number
[35:31] one right especially because like the
[35:34] network what we don't understand with uh
[35:36] or what I don't think gets talked about
[35:38] enough with these let's call them like a
[35:42] crypto protocol right because this is
[35:45] sort of what Bitcoin is it is a protocol
[35:47] at the end of the day is that they
[35:49] benefit from massive network network
[35:52] effects right so you can even though it
[35:56] appears that it's uh that it's very
[36:00] difficult to make a better Bitcoin
[36:02] without trading off some aspects of
[36:05] Bitcoin that make it what it is like
[36:07] it's almost like Bitcoin has like
[36:08] perfected it's got like the perfect
[36:10] balance of like decentralization and
[36:13] block time and block size and all that
[36:15] stuff right so if you change any of
[36:17] those things you're messing with other
[36:19] things you're sacrificing like for
[36:21] example we all know from the blog size
[36:23] Wars increase the blog size potentially
[36:25] you're increasing the cost of running a
[36:26] node and so you decrease
[36:28] decentralization but the point is that
[36:31] these things are networks right and even
[36:34] if somebody could come up with a better
[36:37] Bitcoin like somebody could come up with
[36:39] a more featur Rich Facebook but good
[36:42] luck getting everyone to go off Facebook
[36:44] onto your network right I think it's the
[36:46] same with Bitcoin if somebody was able
[36:48] to come up with something that's
[36:50] technically better than Bitcoin it's
[36:52] still extremely difficult to undo the
[36:55] network effects that Bitcoin has
[36:58] and so that's how I look at that so
[37:00] going back to the other tokens I I kind
[37:03] of already understood that when I got
[37:04] into Bitcoin and so it was like Bitcoin
[37:07] is the thing the rest of them are like
[37:10] it's like
[37:11] gambling right the rest of them like
[37:13] yeah maybe you buy like 10 shitcoins and
[37:16] maybe one of them goes up a th000 X or
[37:18] whatever but what I found was that
[37:21] owning a few shitcoins I was just like
[37:24] constantly checking the price of them
[37:25] all the time and I didn't I didn't know
[37:28] what they did I didn't know how they
[37:29] worked I didn't understand anything
[37:31] about them so at some point I was like
[37:34] let me just concentrate on the one thing
[37:37] that I do kind of understand H and not
[37:39] bother with the rest of
[37:41] it like I might like put all your eggs
[37:44] in the basket that you
[37:48] understand yeah I think this this all in
[37:50] the one basket analogy is also really
[37:53] interesting because for me
[37:54] diversification is um you want you don't
[37:58] want to have centralized risks for
[38:00] example why it makes sense for you to be
[38:03] Diversified when you have an stock
[38:05] portfolio because do you don't want to
[38:07] be dependent on one management team it
[38:09] would be crazy to put all your financial
[38:11] energy in one company even it's if it's
[38:13] a really good company they can still go
[38:16] out of business even if they are doing
[38:17] really really good even Apple can go out
[38:20] of business in some some at some day
[38:23] that is like a low probability uh in
[38:25] like the next five to 10 years uh but
[38:28] even in the next 5 to 10 years there can
[38:30] something major happen and I don't uh I
[38:33] never want to have this when I think
[38:35] about Stock Investing because I don't
[38:37] want to have centralized risk that can
[38:39] be something happening to the management
[38:41] team uh that's why it makes sense when
[38:43] you look at stocks to diversify above
[38:45] like five 10 15 stocks but with Bitcoin
[38:49] there is no uh management team there's
[38:53] no internal risk of course there are
[38:55] like things that you have to look care
[38:57] carefully at and then you have to uh see
[39:00] uh yourself what you do with those
[39:02] things because if you have your Bitcoin
[39:04] on Exchange then you have a risk there
[39:06] you should not do that you should hold
[39:08] your own keys or diversify like have
[39:10] some on Exchange have some on your self
[39:12] custody have maybe different cost
[39:14] Solutions have maybe multi signature
[39:15] there are a lot of lot to it uh but I
[39:18] feel like the diversification is uh it
[39:22] gets thrown around a lot oh you're all
[39:24] in Bitcoin you're not Diversified H okay
[39:27] yeah but what what risk is is there I
[39:30] mean it's like you if you have a if you
[39:32] work for if you have a job right you're
[39:35] all in on that job if you get fired
[39:38] tomorrow you lose your income so you're
[39:40] not Diversified from an income
[39:42] perspective right and that's how most
[39:43] people survive financially is paycheck
[39:46] to paycheck but then when they're
[39:47] putting their like $150 a month away
[39:50] into their you know stock investment
[39:52] thing they're like no I must be fully
[39:53] Diversified let you know lest I lose my
[39:57] Nest T of $5,000
[40:00] so you know I yeah I I'm a big believer
[40:03] in like you're you're not going to
[40:06] excuse me you're not going to you're not
[40:08] going to
[40:09] outperform by just following the market
[40:12] by definition right you're not going to
[40:13] outperform the market by just so you
[40:16] have to take concentrated bets on things
[40:19] that you have a high degree of certainty
[40:21] that are going to work out right and if
[40:23] you do that enough times over your life
[40:26] sure some you will be wrong and you will
[40:28] lose but you just need to be right more
[40:32] than you're wrong to come out on top
[40:35] right look at like every single Ultra
[40:38] rich person in the world has become
[40:41] Ultra Rich because they've gone in on
[40:43] one thing like Warren Buffett Berkshire
[40:46] Hathaway stock Bill Gates Microsoft like
[40:49] so every rich person has become at least
[40:52] initially Rich because they went big and
[40:56] you know some bet of theirs made it and
[40:59] won and gave them outsized returns
[41:02] nobody's ever gotten Rich from well okay
[41:05] maybe if you invest in S&P 500 you know
[41:07] if you if you make a few hundred, salary
[41:10] and you spend less than you make and you
[41:11] put it in S&P 500 Index Fund maybe after
[41:14] 40 years you have like a nice nest
[41:18] egg right but you haven't outperformed
[41:22] you've just gone with the market look at
[41:25] bill I mean Bill Miller that we were
[41:26] mentioning him before that Wes orangee
[41:28] pilled him he was like 80% of his
[41:30] portfolio was in Amazon and
[41:34] Bitcoin right and he's like yeah I made
[41:36] a
[41:39] killing he owned 15% of Amazon at one
[41:42] point 15% of Amazon
[41:45] so yeah and even uh people point this
[41:49] always out with diversification when we
[41:50] talk about war buffer and Berkshire
[41:52] heavy even they are quite uh
[41:56] concentrated with like Coca-Cola stock
[41:58] and Apple stock and even he and I think
[42:01] Charlie mango also said uh the
[42:05] diversification um is an insurance
[42:07] against ignorance as some some some
[42:10] quote around that so even like uh he he
[42:13] was stocks he was like you you have to
[42:16] concentrate on one thing and even he had
[42:19] uh multiple things it's interesting to
[42:21] see but the one thing that I wanted to
[42:22] ask you before with the with the Bitcoin
[42:25] how important uh do you think is the
[42:27] origin story of of Bitcoin that we don't
[42:30] know who sadosi Nakamoto is the mystery
[42:32] around that how different would maybe
[42:35] also Bitcoin beef if there actually
[42:37] would be ahead like I don't know like an
[42:40] uh someone that we actually know and
[42:42] who's visiting Bitcoin
[42:44] conferences yeah I think well it's two
[42:46] different things right to have a to have
[42:48] a head that's known and still around and
[42:52] influential and to have a head that was
[42:54] there at the beginning but is now
[42:56] disappeared
[42:58] uh are like two different things to look
[42:59] at so I think the fact that no one knows
[43:02] who created
[43:05] bitcoin I don't know if that's a good
[43:07] thing or a bad thing as long as like I
[43:09] think if we knew who created it but that
[43:11] person died or wasn't around anymore or
[43:14] whatever maybe it wouldn't be a big deal
[43:16] anyway
[43:17] now right maybe some people are put off
[43:21] but from Bitcoin because they're like
[43:22] what no one knows who made it you know
[43:24] that seems like weird and you know I
[43:26] want to I want to know that somebody
[43:28] that I can trust or somebody that's
[43:29] reputable that made it even if they're
[43:31] not around now I think if we had a
[43:34] figurehead now that would be bad right
[43:37] because it's just another point of
[43:40] centralization even if it's just like on
[43:41] the social layer of it let's just say he
[43:45] has no direct influence he you know
[43:47] there is no like Satoshi can't go in
[43:49] there and change the code and suddenly
[43:51] Bitcoin is whatever he wants it to be
[43:52] and we all are forced to use it that way
[43:54] right uh but it would be bad to somebody
[43:57] who is like a vitalic figure because
[44:00] whether you like it or not people are
[44:02] going to look to him for to to know what
[44:05] to do or what to think or whether
[44:07] something is good or bad and it's nice
[44:10] that we don't have that at all whether
[44:12] it's a good thing that we don't know who
[44:14] created it I don't know maybe it would
[44:17] have been cool if it was like someone
[44:18] awesome that passed away that everyone
[44:20] is like this guy's awesome he created
[44:22] bitcoin it helps bring more people to it
[44:24] because it was like a figure that people
[44:28] yeah it would be interesting I mean
[44:29] there are even um stories about Steve
[44:33] chobs being sat Nakamoto yeah I me a
[44:36] similar time but uh like there's no real
[44:39] substance to it just it would be a story
[44:42] that I would really like to be
[44:43] true yeah if that's what I mean if it
[44:47] was like some legendary figure that
[44:51] brought people yeah that made people
[44:53] like Bitcoin more because of who that
[44:55] person was then I think that would be
[44:57] good thing as long as they're not around
[44:59] anymore yep but even if it uh even if um
[45:04] the figure is not around anymore I mean
[45:06] we see it with vitalic he's around uh
[45:09] right now and obviously it's really bad
[45:11] uh because I see it all the time uh I
[45:15] think even I engaged in that and and and
[45:17] contribute to that and I'm not proud of
[45:19] that I did this last year I try to not
[45:21] do it anymore right now but people put
[45:25] vitalic there and say like oh you trust
[45:29] uh uh this ethereum thing and and the
[45:32] founder and and like kind of the the CEO
[45:34] of it uh looks like that and does that
[45:38] uh and that should I think that should
[45:40] not be be the argument even though it's
[45:42] an interesting and an funny one it's
[45:43] engaging one this has the community
[45:45] aspect to it and I engaged a lot in in
[45:48] that last year try to not do it right
[45:50] now um but uh it's it's I think as when
[45:54] you have someone to attack it Bec more
[45:57] about the figure and less about the
[46:00] technology and and the fundamentals and
[46:02] that's what I really like about that we
[46:04] don't even know anything really about s
[46:07] Nakamoto I mean we know some things of
[46:09] about the emails and stuff like that but
[46:11] uh nothing really
[46:13] substantial uh so we have nothing to
[46:16] even attack it's like an a thing that we
[46:19] canot contribute anything
[46:21] too yeah I mean even then though you
[46:25] essentially the blocksize wars were in
[46:29] part saying this is the original vision
[46:32] for Bitcoin that Satoshi had right based
[46:34] on what the white paper said um versus
[46:38] people who are saying no that's not it
[46:39] it's more the digital gold thing you
[46:41] know they're saying it's peer-to-peer it
[46:42] was the peer-to-peer
[46:44] cash right electronic cash versus the uh
[46:47] store of value digital gold narrative I
[46:50] guess is how you could one of the ways
[46:51] that you could you could frame it um and
[46:56] that's just from like nine-page thing
[46:57] that Satoshi wrote at the beginning and
[47:00] we and it caused the Civil part of that
[47:02] caused the Civil War right arguing about
[47:05] what satoshi's vision for Bitcoin would
[47:08] have been or was back then um so even
[47:12] with like being anonymous only being
[47:14] around for a little bit it still leaves
[47:18] a lot of stuff yeah still it's still
[47:21] it's still what they left what Satoshi
[47:24] left is still like influences what
[47:27] people think today and how people think
[47:29] Bitcoin should be so yeah imagine with
[47:32] someone I do yeah I I get the whole joke
[47:35] like oh vitalic runs ethereum like
[47:37] that's it's it's a Trope right we're
[47:38] making we're poking fun it's like
[47:40] tribalism it's like it's like a if you
[47:42] follow football and you're like a
[47:44] Barcelona fan and a real Madrid fan you
[47:46] just rip into each other that's just
[47:47] like part of the the the fun of being on
[47:50] different tribes and different teams um
[47:53] you know but yeah it's nice it's nice
[47:56] that
[47:58] Bitcoin grew
[47:59] organically as a piece of open- source
[48:02] software that one person you know we
[48:04] think one person worked on and just
[48:06] released onto the internet um whereas
[48:09] like ethereum was orchestrated and organ
[48:13] you know there was an organization of
[48:15] humans behind creating ethereum sure
[48:18] maybe now it's decentralized enough that
[48:20] no one person can control it or not I
[48:22] don't really follow the like sort of
[48:24] governance of ethereum that closely
[48:26] anymore I to be like you like you know
[48:28] before I would engage in a lot of like
[48:29] ethereum trolling and you know dunking
[48:32] on on shitcoins and stuff like that and
[48:33] I tried to do it less and less these
[48:35] days uh because it's just not that
[48:36] productive I'd rather focus on you know
[48:39] on bitcoin what I can do for Bitcoin
[48:42] what Bitcoin can do for me and uh living
[48:44] my life rather rather than doing a lot
[48:46] of dunking on the internet on other
[48:47] people um but yeah it is
[48:50] it the way Bitcoin was created is
[48:53] virtually impossible to recreate
[48:58] that's a thing that's uh even beyond the
[49:00] network effect uh that's something so
[49:03] beautiful it's like if if Bitcoin
[49:06] actually is what we all think it is um
[49:10] and it will be this Global money and it
[49:12] will be really successful this origin
[49:14] story is such a nice one and there are
[49:16] already so many books about who zoshi
[49:19] might be and all those things like
[49:21] they're interpreting the emails what
[49:24] accent it could be like where it could
[49:26] could be like I even like I know in the
[49:29] beginning I was also really fascinated
[49:31] with the story and I got to know um I
[49:33] forgot who said it to me it was some
[49:35] podcast uh that I did with someone he
[49:38] said like his girlfriend uh was not
[49:40] interested in Bitcoin but once she heard
[49:43] about the story of Satoshi Nakamoto she
[49:45] all of the sudden got really interested
[49:47] in Bitcoin she because she researched so
[49:49] much about him because she found that
[49:51] origin story so interesting so I think
[49:53] there's some some beauty to to that and
[49:56] it Mak part of the the value of Bitcoin
[49:59] it could have been also successful if we
[50:01] actually know him uh would have maybe
[50:03] been different but it's it's it's a
[50:06] really it's also like the spirit of
[50:08] Satoshi where you contribute something
[50:11] to society uh and you don't get the
[50:13] credit for it that's why I also decided
[50:15] on the podcast because some people like
[50:17] oh can I take the video can I take that
[50:19] and I'm like yes like I also made like
[50:21] the YouTube switch from I don't know how
[50:24] they called like now it's open to anyone
[50:26] uh and everyone can just like take the
[50:29] video uh and do whatever they want with
[50:32] it like I'm totally fine with that I
[50:33] said it multiple times in the podcast uh
[50:36] and even if you don't if you want to do
[50:38] something commercial with me uh I hit me
[50:42] up I will give you the raw footage I
[50:44] don't care uh you spread Bitcoin you
[50:46] spread my podcast it's it's it's fine
[50:48] with me uh so I think that's the true
[50:50] Spirit of satosi like just like
[50:52] contributing to society and and not
[50:54] necessarily taking the credit even even
[50:56] though it's important that you
[50:59] also um make something out of that so
[51:01] you can live of that so like you can
[51:03] contribute more on that but yeah that I
[51:06] like that Satoshi Spirit a lot and I I
[51:09] love that Bitcoin has this this origin
[51:12] story yeah it's cool it's kind of like
[51:15] being it you know the people who are
[51:17] Anonymous on Twitter and stuff they're
[51:19] kind of like taking on this ethos of
[51:21] Satoshi which is like you know you don't
[51:22] want to be known uh and there is a there
[51:27] is something about human nature that uh
[51:30] likes this sort of
[51:32] mystery like I think i' I felt it with
[51:35] Gandalf as well where people like when
[51:37] they meet me if they already know who I
[51:39] am it's kind of like whatever but if
[51:41] they're meeting like gandal they don't
[51:43] you know who's like not public and
[51:44] nobody really knows who he is that's a
[51:46] lot cooler for some reason um and I
[51:49] think it's the same with like it's the
[51:50] same with Satoshi it's a lot cooler to
[51:52] have this like mystery behind the origin
[51:53] story of Bitcoin which is like nobody
[51:55] knows who made it was Satoshi and what
[51:57] you know all these things whereas like
[52:00] ethereum it's metallic you know we know
[52:02] what he looks like we know he's like I
[52:05] think it's it's like it's like uh
[52:07] reading a book versus watching a movie
[52:09] right in a book you make up you know you
[52:12] make up the characters in your head
[52:14] obviously they're described but everyone
[52:15] has like a slightly different image of a
[52:17] character in their head but then you
[52:19] watch the movie and it's like that's not
[52:20] how I imagined him at all right so with
[52:23] Satoshi we can all kind of imagine we
[52:26] don't know who he or she is and so we
[52:29] all have to just like imagine this
[52:30] person and since he made something that
[52:32] we all think is is cool you know it's
[52:35] very likely that we're like making him
[52:37] out to be this awesome character in our
[52:39] head perhaps if we actually met found
[52:42] out who Satoshi really was and met him
[52:44] we' be like oh you know not not that
[52:48] cool the image would be
[52:51] destroyed um Coming closer to the to the
[52:54] end of the podcast I have a question
[52:56] that I only asked once in the podcast
[52:58] but the answer was so interesting so I
[53:00] thought like yeah let's ask it more
[53:02] times um what annoys you the most uh in
[53:06] the Bitcoin
[53:09] Community oh man just one
[53:11] thing you can do as much things as you
[53:16] want I I mean I don't I don't like the I
[53:19] I don't like some of the
[53:21] preachiness that's around you know
[53:23] people like I think the ethos of Bitcoin
[53:27] is very libertarian but you get a lot of
[53:29] people who are like constantly telling
[53:31] you how you should live your life what
[53:32] you should eat what you should do what's
[53:34] moral what's not moral what's right
[53:36] what's wrong um I don't know if it's you
[53:39] know to be fair when you meet people in
[53:40] real life that's not what they're like
[53:42] at
[53:42] all uh but you I guess it's just like
[53:45] the odd Twitter person screeching that
[53:49] comes up on the timeline and gives you
[53:50] this impression that there is a lot of a
[53:52] lot of preachiness so it's yeah it's
[53:55] almost like you
[53:57] know people who are like laring as
[54:00] Libertarians are actually secretly like
[54:04] dictators and I I don't like there is
[54:06] this also feeling because Bitcoin is
[54:08] free and open source that like
[54:09] everything anyone does should be free
[54:11] and like you know free and open source
[54:13] and if somebody makes like puts
[54:15] something for sale or tries to make some
[54:16] money out of their work it's like oh
[54:18] what are you doing why isn't it free and
[54:19] open source so uh I don't like that
[54:23] either um but yeah I mean generally I
[54:26] would say it's nothing about Bitcoin
[54:28] itself it's from it's the social layer
[54:31] of of things but I guess that's just
[54:33] like a human thing and it would happen
[54:34] in any other industry or uh you know
[54:39] around any other area of Interest not
[54:41] just Bitcoin but that's just just what
[54:43] comes to mind with Bitcoin there's this
[54:46] a great meme uh where there are two dogs
[54:49] really loudly baring at at each other
[54:51] and there's like a fence in between and
[54:54] then the fence goes up and then they're
[54:57] like really nice to each other they're
[54:58] not doing anything so it's like when
[55:00] they're FC there and when you're on
[55:02] Twitter
[55:03] like but on when you're actually going
[55:06] in real life and that's why I'm saying
[55:07] to everyone go onto the real life and
[55:09] meet bitcoiners go to a local Meetup go
[55:11] to conference go to whatever like like
[55:14] go there's orange pill up there there's
[55:16] so many possibilities that you can
[55:18] actually meet um real life bitcoiners
[55:22] and the uh the experience is so much
[55:25] different than on Twitter and all those
[55:27] places because they are actually nice
[55:29] people that are completely normal
[55:31] they're not barking at each other and
[55:34] they're not saying oh you have to eat
[55:36] meat and you have to do this yeah
[55:38] they're just nice people these things
[55:41] could be also just a you know in it
[55:43] could be a a as a result of just being
[55:45] on the internet where you know Twitter
[55:47] is not exactly a place for nuance
[55:49] discussion or communication so uh it
[55:53] could also just be that yeah because
[55:55] like like you said go I would definitely
[55:57] recommend you know if somebody wants to
[55:59] like sort of make it in the Bitcoin
[56:00] space as in they want to be more
[56:01] involved in the Bitcoin space I would
[56:03] say get on Twitter share your thoughts
[56:06] interact with people
[56:07] there and then go to conferences in
[56:10] person and meet the people that you talk
[56:12] to on Twitter in real life uh and you
[56:15] will be in the Bitcoin space then you
[56:18] get getting physical getting actually uh
[56:21] in real life meeting people in the
[56:23] Bitcoin Community it's so necessary even
[56:26] if like for every anyone that wants to
[56:28] have a career or anything like that that
[56:30] you just said it like you have to do
[56:32] this anyways like it's it's it's almost
[56:34] uh uh necessary it's it's like you can
[56:37] do it without but it's almost necessary
[56:40] uh but even if you don't want to uh have
[56:43] like a career in Bitcoin even if you're
[56:44] just interested in Bitcoin or you have a
[56:46] lot of Bitcoin and you just want to
[56:48] explore what the community and
[56:50] everything is about you get so many
[56:52] insights I loved it I could could not I
[56:55] didn't not had enough time this year but
[56:56] last year I went to every booth there
[56:59] was and I spoke with every company this
[57:01] was such a nice overview and insights in
[57:03] the what's what's right now and then you
[57:05] go to a conference and you're like oh
[57:07] [ __ ] this Bitcoin thing is an actual
[57:09] industry it's not just like some weird
[57:12] token on the internet that you bought
[57:14] and it goes up and Bitcoin is an actual
[57:16] industry where actual real life people
[57:19] actually work yep there's businesses I
[57:21] mean there's you know there's businesses
[57:23] that have been around for 10 years that
[57:25] employ hundreds of people
[57:27] uh who you know their entire careers are
[57:29] based on on on the Bitcoin industry so
[57:33] yeah completely agree the the going to
[57:36] conferences in person is a game changer
[57:39] definitely definitely perfect then uh
[57:42] before we get to the end routine I have
[57:43] one more question that I ask all my
[57:45] guests now uh to the the goal of that
[57:49] question is to learn from each other
[57:51] outside of Bitcoin um and the question
[57:54] is what are you currently passionate
[57:55] about besides Bitcoin what are you
[57:57] currently learning about doing activity
[58:00] passionate about no matter what it is U
[58:03] besides
[58:05] Bitcoin storytelling that's what I'm
[58:07] focusing on right now I mean it it's
[58:10] because of Bitcoin is because I'm trying
[58:12] to find better ways to communicate the
[58:15] value proposition of Bitcoin uh that I
[58:18] stumbled on like on on storytelling so
[58:21] that's what I've been studying is like
[58:23] what is a good story what is the
[58:25] structure of a good story one of the
[58:26] elements of a good
[58:28] story uh so that's a really important
[58:31] step and we have tin in the podcast
[58:33] where the previous guest is asking a
[58:35] question for the next guest without
[58:37] knowing who actually the next guest uh
[58:39] is and the question today is really
[58:41] interesting um what world do you want to
[58:44] create uh for your children and how
[58:46] different will it be for them compared
[58:49] to
[58:51] you that's a deep question isn't it it's
[58:55] good would be a long
[59:00] one I mean I'll try to relate it to
[59:03] bitcoin a little bit just to keep it on
[59:05] topic but I
[59:07] think if we can live in a world where
[59:09] money is not controlled by any one
[59:12] entity person state government or
[59:15] whatever that will be a fairer world you
[59:18] know
[59:18] unfortunately human nature is such that
[59:21] we're corrupted we're almost corrupted
[59:23] by the power that having control over
[59:25] money
[59:26] brings and so we can't help but use that
[59:30] power to benefit ourselves and usually
[59:33] at the at you know at the cost of other
[59:36] people so having a money that we can't
[59:40] that no one can control I think just
[59:43] makes things makes Society a little bit
[59:46] fairer a little bit more
[59:48] meritocratic um so that would be I I
[59:52] would hope my children can grow up in a
[59:55] world with Fair money how different
[59:58] would that be like what do you imagine
[60:00] the the world outside of the money being
[60:02] fair uh would what would that change for
[60:06] society well I mean maybe in countries
[60:09] where money tends to work relatively
[60:13] well the impact wouldn't be massive but
[60:15] I think for a lot of countries where
[60:17] their money is you know worthless it
[60:19] would be everything you know people can
[60:21] people can spend mental energy on
[60:24] actually doing some produ stuff with
[60:26] their lives rather than worrying about
[60:28] you know they have to get on a bus to go
[60:30] get cash out or they you know their
[60:33] government print a bajillion Zimbabwean
[60:36] dollars and all their savings are now
[60:37] worthless and they have to start again
[60:39] from scratch I think we lost we lose a
[60:41] lot of human
[60:43] potential by having broken money and we
[60:46] fixed that by having good money
[60:48] again I love it a lot yeah um great then
[60:52] before I let you go where can people
[60:54] find you and ask a question
[60:57] so Twitter is the best place I'm at BTC
[61:00] gandal and everything flows from
[61:04] Twitter perfect will you change the the
[61:08] handl at some point or is will it I'm
[61:11] I'm gonna I'm Gonna Keep it I'm going to
[61:12] keep it it's a nice like little Relic
[61:14] and memory of the past and I don't think
[61:16] anyone really looks at it so it would it
[61:18] would be more confusing if people are
[61:20] trying to find me and I've Chang I've
[61:21] also changed the handle I think people
[61:23] always remember the ad BTC gandal thing
[61:25] so they can always find me that way if
[61:27] they don't remember what my real name is
[61:28] or
