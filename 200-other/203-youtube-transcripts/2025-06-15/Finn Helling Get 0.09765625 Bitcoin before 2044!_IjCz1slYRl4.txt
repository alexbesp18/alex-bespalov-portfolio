[00:00] I don't know what Bitcoin myself who
[00:01] stopped being a bitcoiner 21 billion
[00:03] Bitcoin divided by 8 billion people then
[00:06] you are at
[00:07] 0.0026 25 Bitcoin per person and of
[00:10] course the realistic number would be
[00:12] much less than that Bitcoin has no top
[00:14] because fat has no bottom so you always
[00:16] will see how Bitcoin is rising work hard
[00:18] safe in Bitcoin and I can actually
[00:19] retire on that or buy a home someday
[00:22] that's just not possible with a Fiat
[00:24] money in the Fiat system where you can
[00:25] exploit others using the system the can
[00:27] your effect and with Bitcoin you can be
[00:29] greedy but you need to provide value to
[00:31] other people you can't get more Bitcoin
[00:33] other than providing value there are
[00:34] people calculating potential market cap
[00:36] of Bitcoin but that's nonsense my
[00:37] opinion because bitco would be the thing
[00:39] you would price everything when you look
[00:40] at 2044 block subsidy it will be less
[00:43] than 0.1 BTC everyone in the world
[00:46] basically every minor will be competing
[00:48] for 10 minutes for this 0.1 BTC just one
[00:52] bigger state says hey we are buying
[00:54] Bitcoin and we're backing our fiat
[00:56] currency with that it's over
[01:01] how did you get there to see Bitcoin as
[01:04] an insurance policy so I have many
[01:06] friends who are no coiners or really
[01:08] don't want to hear anything about
[01:09] Bitcoin and I always talk about it and
[01:11] they're like ah no stop it and I mean it
[01:15] I understand it basically everyone when
[01:18] he's he has hears about Bitcoin for the
[01:20] first time he's like ah doesn't sound
[01:23] that great especially because of the I
[01:25] don't know the things that the media
[01:28] publish often times about Bitcoin
[01:29] regarding regarding the energy usage and
[01:32] so on and um so I mean in the end when
[01:36] you really have zero Bitcoin you're
[01:39] betting that Bitcoin will not Prevail
[01:42] Prevail at 100% basically you're just
[01:47] going with a huge risk in my opinion and
[01:50] I don't think that's uh that's rational
[01:53] um so I think um we are so early in
[01:56] Bitcoin and I think many people just
[01:59] misunderstand how early we are but you
[02:03] can just um so what I'm talking about
[02:05] the Bitcoin insurance I'm just saying
[02:06] hey just buy a little bit Bitcoin and I
[02:10] mean really a little little bit Bitcoin
[02:12] and um so I just took 21 million Bitcoin
[02:15] divided by around 8 billion people and
[02:18] then you are at
[02:20] 0.0026 25 Bitcoin per person and of
[02:23] course the realistic number would be
[02:25] much less than that but that's basically
[02:28] the the amount you should have at least
[02:30] and that's the amount I also uh when
[02:33] there's a wedding for example I give the
[02:35] people the amount in Bitcoin and so I
[02:38] make sure people have this amount that's
[02:40] everything what I want from people
[02:42] around me Family Friends just buy this
[02:45] amount of Bitcoin and I'm fine I won't
[02:47] talk about Bitcoin with you again if you
[02:48] don't want to but you are just you have
[02:51] an insurance then bit when Bitcoin gets
[02:53] big and really is something relevant in
[02:55] the future you have enough Bitcoin that
[02:57] you won't be poor in a Bitcoin standard
[03:00] that's basically idea behind that so
[03:02] that's the the minimum amount of Bitcoin
[03:05] to make sure you have a Bitcoin
[03:07] insurance policy or or could you even go
[03:10] lower than that depending on the time
[03:12] zone yeah I think uh like these zero
[03:16] when you divide by 8 billion people and
[03:18] we have 21 million Bitcoin there aren't
[03:20] 21 billion Bitcoin even yet there are
[03:22] like 4 million coins lost you also need
[03:24] to calculate the zosi zosi coins the 1
[03:28] million round about then you have all
[03:30] the companies big ETFs whatever that
[03:32] also have huge amount of Bitcoin and we
[03:34] have billionaires and millionaires we
[03:36] also have much more Bitcoin than any any
[03:38] other person so the realistic number
[03:41] would be far less than these
[03:44] 0.262 5bit BTC maybe just half of it
[03:49] maybe just I don't know it's I don't
[03:52] know and you can calculate it but these
[03:54] uh 21 million Bitcoin divided by 8
[03:57] billion people is at least the one you
[03:58] can you can c Cate and you can be sure
[04:01] that this is a at least a um yeah a
[04:05] number you can count on yeah I always
[04:08] like to calculate actually with with 10
[04:11] billion people and with 15 million
[04:13] Bitcoin uh the the further out we go I
[04:16] think population will will continue to
[04:18] grow hopefully otherwise we make some
[04:22] mistakes uh and uh Bitcoin will continue
[04:26] to to get lost I I got a really
[04:29] interesting
[04:30] question I think a few weeks ago on a
[04:33] podcast um she basically asked me what
[04:36] happens if we lose all the Bitcoin like
[04:39] if the last the last access the last
[04:42] satosi also gets gets lost like that is
[04:45] that the the only way Bitcoin
[04:49] fails uh maybe
[04:52] yeah no I think that's a I mean how
[04:56] should that happen you can always divide
[04:58] Bitcoin further so there I don't see the
[05:00] problem there but uh I think I you know
[05:04] when you study Bitcoin you just go
[05:05] through and think hey what could go
[05:07] wrong and when you start with it when
[05:10] you start with learning Bitcoin you are
[05:11] oh this could go wrong and that and this
[05:13] and everything but it's more when you
[05:16] put more time in it you realize hey
[05:18] there aren't so many things that could
[05:19] go wrong and I think actually the maybe
[05:22] the biggest threat the Bitcoin would be
[05:26] that someone someone somewhere sometime
[05:31] uh comes to the idea that hey I don't
[05:34] know this person somehow gets really
[05:36] much power and he gets the people to
[05:38] convince them that hey you should change
[05:41] you don't know you should change the
[05:42] roots of Bitcoin to 50 million coins
[05:45] whatever you should give me some more
[05:47] rights in the protocol that I can censor
[05:49] people that isn't decentralized and
[05:51] censorship free anymore and I mean I
[05:54] just I can't imagine how that should
[05:56] happen um because you always have uh
[05:59] also this negative uh scale effects I
[06:01] don't know if that's the right word in
[06:03] English I hope you know what I mean um
[06:05] so I really don't know how this should
[06:07] happen but I think that's the biggest
[06:09] problem that people just forget what
[06:10] Bitcoin is and what it makes what makes
[06:12] it Bitcoin these rules but didn't we had
[06:16] that already kind of in 2017 with the
[06:19] the the block size was I mean it was not
[06:20] about increasing the the uh how many
[06:24] Bitcoin we have it was about increasing
[06:26] the block size uh there was like really
[06:28] popular faces and voices uh for
[06:31] increasing the block size like the
[06:33] mining uh industry was was for that like
[06:35] that that's for me always the without
[06:38] that um I would see more danger to
[06:41] bitcoin with that Bitcoin kind of has
[06:44] proven that it's really resilient
[06:46] against those kind of attacks like the
[06:48] block size was when I started that I
[06:50] really got confident about Bitcoin I
[06:53] don't know about you yes exactly that's
[06:55] uh how I see it too um I mean you could
[06:58] see that even when there are large
[07:01] entities like coinbase and so on really
[07:03] large players in the space and the
[07:04] miners and everyone says hey let's
[07:06] change Bitcoin but the notes back then
[07:09] they know the rules the Bitcoin rules
[07:12] and they decided no we keep it clean the
[07:16] old school Bitcoin way and uh as long as
[07:18] and yeah we can now say say yeah that
[07:21] happens uh big players couldn't change
[07:24] Bitcoin so that's really good and that's
[07:25] also something that's something because
[07:28] that makes me think that that the
[07:29] scenario is quite unlikely but I don't
[07:32] really see more likely scenarios that
[07:35] make Bitcoin go uh crash or go away
[07:39] forever you know absolutely it's it's an
[07:43] interesting uh thing because like I
[07:46] think um a lot of big Bitcoin critics uh
[07:50] over time turn to bit uh big Bitcoin
[07:53] Advocates as they study what could go
[07:56] wrong with Bitcoin and then they're like
[07:58] oh oh that Avenue actually is not that
[08:00] uh likely oh [ __ ] you have the same
[08:02] class as me I saw it oh [ __ ] I thought
[08:07] I'm sorry for for for that conf like I
[08:10] was the only weirdo that has always
[08:12] drinks with one liter
[08:15] class that's what we call short glass in
[08:17] Germany yeah yes like the very short
[08:21] ones you also have what game there right
[08:24] yeah sure sure no beer it's too
[08:26] unhealthy Sor that I just to notice that
[08:30] because uh a lot of guests call me crazy
[08:32] that I have like those big class it's
[08:34] also a heavy class if there's like one
[08:36] liter water in there and the class
[08:38] itself is heavy like it's sometimes
[08:39] really heavy to carry uh but I forgot
[08:43] where I was uh going with with that yeah
[08:46] critics yeah yeah the resilience of of
[08:48] Bitcoin it kind of forms your resilience
[08:51] uh talking about Bitcoin um you
[08:53] mentioned I I wanted to go another
[08:55] Avenue down but uh let's let's go that
[08:58] one argument also down
[09:00] um you mentioned the energy F uh in the
[09:02] beginning when people think about
[09:05] Bitcoin um one thing that is fascinating
[09:08] for me and and I talked with someone
[09:11] that is in Bitcoin since 10 years and he
[09:12] makes actually content around Bitcoin
[09:14] since 10 years he's Bitcoin espanol he
[09:16] was probably the first Spanish uh
[09:18] Bitcoin content creator uh and he
[09:21] basically opened my eyes to he F uh in
[09:25] 10 years ago the same things that I
[09:27] think now about Bitcoin and how people
[09:29] can wake up to the Bitcoin and people
[09:31] will slowly get it and he's like yeah
[09:33] still 10 years after that my friends and
[09:36] family even though they saw the wealth
[09:38] growth they still call me crazy they
[09:40] still have all those misconceptions of
[09:42] bit about Bitcoin in their head and it
[09:44] doesn't get better and and then I was
[09:48] like oh should is that in 10 years still
[09:51] the case is is something changing is
[09:54] like do you see those misconceptions
[09:56] like the energy fud and on all those
[09:58] those weird things about Bitcoin going
[10:00] away anytime anytime soon and especially
[10:03] with black rock and really the big
[10:04] players now coming into the scene is
[10:06] that that story now changing over the
[10:09] next 10 years or will in 10 years the
[10:11] the people still say the same thing I
[10:14] think so so I um the energy F you're
[10:17] seeing so much uh so many papers
[10:19] scientific papers being released that
[10:21] say Hey Bitcoin isn't that bad as you
[10:23] think and just continues and I think
[10:25] it's just really you can't say that
[10:27] anymore if you're honest critic or an
[10:30] honest journalist um so this kind of f
[10:33] is fading I mean maybe there are coming
[10:36] maybe in the future there will be some
[10:38] uh some other stuff like I know Bitcoin
[10:40] is far right or something like that they
[10:42] made something up made something up
[10:44] maybe but um yeah in the end I think
[10:48] people are more getting it it's it's
[10:50] basically Lindy effect somehow so you
[10:53] hear about Bitcoin few years ago already
[10:56] and you saw it rise up and crash and you
[10:59] was you were like yeah okay that's it
[11:01] Bitcoin is gone then a few few years
[11:03] later you hear I don't know friends
[11:05] whoever also talk about Bitcoin you're
[11:07] like hey that's still alive I don't know
[11:09] and you just hear keep hearing about
[11:11] Bitcoin and you also while you're
[11:13] hearing about Bitcoin you see that
[11:15] Bitcoin is rising in price like M like M
[11:19] sker said Bitcoin has no top because fat
[11:22] has no bottom so you always will see how
[11:23] Bitcoin is rising and um that's just
[11:27] make this will make you curious I mean
[11:29] people are greedy especially Fiat people
[11:31] and no coiners are for the most part uh
[11:35] Fiat guys who just need to beat
[11:38] inflation either they know it or they
[11:40] don't know it but they need to beat
[11:41] inflation and so they will really uh
[11:46] like something that goes up in value and
[11:48] the will be more open I think the longer
[11:51] Bitcoin exists the more people will say
[11:52] hey that's interesting and the more
[11:54] people will uh have a better or more
[11:58] positive image of Bitcoin that's what I
[12:02] think and that's what I also would say
[12:04] and I'm already uh yeah watching it's it
[12:07] doesn't happen that fast of course it
[12:09] will take years but uh I think it's
[12:12] slowly changing like the energy F yeah
[12:14] absolutely uh and uh especially if you
[12:17] look at the Bitcoin only content
[12:19] developed I think that was not even a
[12:21] thing like in 2020 uh and slowly with
[12:24] 2020 and 2021 it really developed so
[12:27] many Bitcoin only content creators and
[12:29] Bitcoin only podcasts and and speakers
[12:32] that uh and conferences like how how big
[12:35] those Bitcoin only conferences like
[12:38] Bitcoin prag or something like that is
[12:40] it's it's astonishing and there's like
[12:41] really high signal there I love to see
[12:43] that definitely yeah that's uh so as you
[12:46] might have he I'm German so when I
[12:49] started uh I don't know I've got into
[12:50] Bitcoin and shitcoins in 2019 round
[12:52] about and um when I started with Bitcoin
[12:56] there weren't any Bitcoin Maxis who did
[13:00] YouTube videos basically so I didn't
[13:02] know any of them and with 2020 there
[13:05] also like one or two people maybe and
[13:08] that's what I started my own YouTube
[13:09] channel in 2022 just because there
[13:12] weren't any Bitcoin only content in
[13:14] Germany people told me yeah when you
[13:16] look in uh English content there is much
[13:19] of many videos on bitcoin only but in
[13:22] the German space at least that's not the
[13:24] case that's why I started to yeah do
[13:27] this kind of videos explain Bitcoin and
[13:30] and explain what makes a difference to
[13:32] shitcoins and so on and yeah that's
[13:35] something uh that's also changing and
[13:37] makes me much more positive for the
[13:40] future of Bitcoin and the speed of
[13:42] adoption at least in the German space
[13:44] but I
[13:45] think yeah absolutely uh I'm actually
[13:49] really impressed and that's why I do it
[13:51] in English because uh the German Bitcoin
[13:55] uh content Space is really good like uh
[13:59] I speak with people in the Spanish
[14:01] community in the French community in
[14:03] other communities um and they just tell
[14:05] me or in the Hungarian Community also
[14:08] spoke with someone and they just tell me
[14:09] oh that there's like not like one two
[14:12] really good people that make really nice
[14:14] content and in German there's so many
[14:16] great ones like and that was one of my
[14:18] reasons like oh like that it doesn't
[14:20] matter if I'm doing English or German
[14:22] because the competition is in both quite
[14:24] High honestly uh and that's why I was
[14:27] like I want to speak with everyone in
[14:28] the world I want to speak with Asians I
[14:30] want to speak with Africans I want to
[14:31] speak with Americans uh and that's why I
[14:34] force every German to speak
[14:38] English I hope I hope they they still
[14:40] like me aftering the English uh
[14:44] conversion too much um you you mentioned
[14:48] also something interesting the Lindy
[14:49] effect it comes up in in Bitcoin
[14:51] conversation a lot and I think um not
[14:54] every Bitcoin is aware of that um can
[14:57] you quickly explain like what is the the
[14:59] Linda effect and why it's important in
[15:00] the context of of Bitcoin yeah it's
[15:03] basically uh it says it's a rule of pump
[15:06] so it's not really hard uh rule but you
[15:10] can say that if a technology or idea
[15:14] exist for let's say 10 years it's likely
[15:17] that this technology idea will continue
[15:19] to at least exist in 10 more years and
[15:23] the more it uh lives the longer it will
[15:25] live basically that's the lindia effects
[15:28] run about and um yeah that's that's some
[15:30] effects uh that you can always say hey
[15:33] Bitcoin has the biggest Lind effect it's
[15:34] the first
[15:36] cryptocurrency and uh yeah every other
[15:39] cryptocurrency came after that and so
[15:41] also has a slow small Lindy effect so
[15:44] the lind effect and the network effect
[15:46] basically are the two biggest effects
[15:49] maybe when it comes to bitcoin and why
[15:51] it's Bitcoin only and not
[15:53] shitcoins and you make a lot of uh lot
[15:56] of cont you you make also content around
[15:59] altcoins and and [ __ ] coins uh which is
[16:02] uh really fascinating to to see and you
[16:05] make it uh even you you make fun content
[16:08] about it as I remembered I liked some of
[16:11] your videos um my first question about
[16:13] is like why are they still around like
[16:16] what's holding the altcoins and it's
[16:17] just it's a quite big Market also like
[16:19] it's not like a such a a small small
[16:22] Market it's not like 1% of Bitcoin
[16:24] Market it's like um probably like a
[16:27] little less than than than half of it or
[16:29] something like that like the the whole
[16:31] outco Market is is smaller than the
[16:33] whole Bitcoin Market but it's it's it's
[16:35] catching on it depends on if you count
[16:37] in the stable coins I don't know if it's
[16:39] really crypto it's it's more
[16:41] like but um that's also we already talk
[16:45] about that um a few years back then it
[16:47] was like Bitcoin was an energy killer it
[16:49] was so bad for the environment you know
[16:52] all this fat and this fat somehow starts
[16:56] to disappear and back then everyone was
[16:59] talking about ah proof of work is much
[17:01] energy is not energy efficient we have
[17:04] proof of stake that's much better and um
[17:07] I have to at least how I see it it's
[17:10] more like proof of stake is not getting
[17:12] uh it's not that hot topic anymore
[17:14] people realize that it's basically just
[17:16] proof of wealth and it's just a Fiat
[17:18] system on steroids and so they uh
[17:21] promote the new I won't call any names
[17:23] here but there are new shitcoins who uh
[17:26] do proof of work and basically just copy
[17:28] the Bitcoin marketing and just say
[17:30] lightning doesn't work and more solution
[17:33] Bitcoin can't scale and that's my
[17:35] project is basically just like Bitcoin
[17:37] with proof of work every other coin is
[17:39] also a shitcoin I agree with you but
[17:41] this one coin is it's it's scalable
[17:45] because it isn't a blockchain it's a
[17:46] different kind of blockchain that isn't
[17:48] called blockchain so it doesn't have the
[17:50] blockchain tremma and so on so the
[17:52] marketing changes and I think we're
[17:55] heading somewhere where I don't know
[17:57] what you could still continue
[17:59] um some sometime there won't be any uh
[18:02] new marketing I think any new crypto
[18:05] marketing ideas that you can uh copy at
[18:08] least I think that so uh yeah I started
[18:11] my YouTube channel in 2022 the middle it
[18:13] was a really deep be bare market and uh
[18:16] I was like yeah I could now tell people
[18:19] what is a blockchain what is a
[18:20] cryptocurrency but there weren't any new
[18:22] people there in the market so I just
[18:24] said thought hey we have so many [ __ ]
[18:27] Corners year in the crypto space and I
[18:29] just maybe I can talk to them with a
[18:33] little bit more advanced videos and
[18:35] stuff um so not really that beginner
[18:37] friendly and so I can just convert some
[18:40] uh some [ __ ] coiners to bitcoiners and
[18:43] get them on yeah the right side or
[18:46] however you want to call it I mean we
[18:49] kind of see uh with etherum since they
[18:52] switch from proof of work to proof of
[18:53] stake I think that's the the that's the
[18:56] main and the most popular example for me
[19:00] uh that proof of stake is losing in the
[19:02] free market I mean it's now what two two
[19:05] and a half three years something like
[19:07] that I think two and a half maybe uh
[19:09] years since this switched so it's not
[19:11] that long of a time zone so that will be
[19:13] more obvious in like five 10 years span
[19:16] if if if is still around back uh then uh
[19:19] but it's it's really sinking since like
[19:21] three and a half years I think uh
[19:22] against Bitcoin and that that speaks
[19:24] volume to like or the free market
[19:26] doesn't like proof of stake it actually
[19:29] doesn't make sense proof of stake
[19:31] because it's just basically a stock and
[19:33] then a stock has to really prove itself
[19:35] with a nice product and service if they
[19:36] canot deliver uh they will go away uh
[19:39] which I I hear that argument a lot that
[19:42] um we will have in the future just proof
[19:43] of stake companies and not the
[19:45] traditional stock market it's it's also
[19:48] like interesting because I don't think
[19:49] that government even want will let that
[19:52] happen uh and and this this argument
[19:56] also make Bitcoin as against Bitcoin
[19:59] that the governments will not let this
[20:01] happen the difference is you cannot turn
[20:03] off Bitcoin but you can turn off every
[20:05] shitcoin like that's the that's the main
[20:07] difference for me yes like you said I
[20:10] mean you can basically just do a few
[20:12] phone calls and say hey Amazon AWS shut
[20:16] down some bit some ethereum notes and
[20:18] then you always have and just few other
[20:20] Co phone codes and it's already uh in
[20:22] huge problems and that's what you can't
[20:24] do to bitcoin like you said it's if you
[20:27] already lost over 50% since merge when
[20:29] it switched to Pro of stake and you can
[20:32] you also can see the uh when I really I
[20:35] was on my YouTube channel I was talking
[20:37] yeah there won't be a ethereum sport ETF
[20:40] really I was really convinced Michael S
[20:42] also said it and um then there was the
[20:45] eum SPF and I got really the [ __ ]
[20:47] coiners were angry and they made fun of
[20:50] me but you can see now uh these e SP
[20:53] really they don't have any traction
[20:54] nobody wants them uh there's basically
[20:57] no money flowing in just out and that's
[21:00] not comparable to bitcoin so I think
[21:02] that's yeah you can see that how it's
[21:04] happening the free market has decided
[21:06] and it's continuing to fall toward zero
[21:09] like every other shitcoin compared to
[21:10] bitcoin let's talk about something um
[21:13] more interesting than
[21:15] shitcoins let's talk about um why you
[21:19] also have I think one video uh maybe it
[21:21] was someone else um the significance of
[21:24] one Bitcoin we talked before of like uh
[21:28] the insurance policy and how you get to
[21:30] like 0.00 to bitcoin or something like
[21:33] that to have like at least some
[21:35] insurance policies but most people have
[21:38] at least now the possibilities to buy
[21:41] more than that uh especially if we
[21:43] consider the audience uh my audience is
[21:46] like 50% America then the UK Canada uh
[21:49] Europe so like uh most of my audience
[21:52] probably has the the capacity to buy way
[21:55] more than just a few Sates
[21:59] um why is that whole coiner status and
[22:03] that the significance of 100 million
[22:05] Sates are one Bitcoin uh such a big one
[22:09] uh and uh how how reachable is that that
[22:12] goal still I think it's just
[22:15] psychological it's like you you want to
[22:16] have one wo thing and when you have one
[22:18] wo Bitcoin you want to have two wo
[22:20] Bitcoins and then you want to have five
[22:22] it won't it won't stop so it's just
[22:24] greed and it's natural I think it's a
[22:26] Bitcoin makes greed some of good
[22:29] the first time not like in the Fiat
[22:30] system where you can exploit others
[22:32] using the system the Canon effect and
[22:35] with Bitcoin you can yeah have be greedy
[22:37] but you need to provide value to other
[22:39] people you can't get more Bitcoin other
[22:41] than providing value and um yeah so
[22:44] that's one Bitcoin of course it's a
[22:46] especially today it's from some people
[22:49] reachable but uh when you consider that
[22:53] we really speaking about Bitcoin being
[22:56] the discovery of absolute mathematical
[22:58] capity it's uh yeah it's so much more
[23:03] worth than it's today you can't I mean
[23:06] there is always when you look at YouTube
[23:07] or so there are people calculated the
[23:09] market cap the potential market cap of
[23:11] Bitcoin but that's nonsense my opinion
[23:13] because Bitcoin would just Bitcoin would
[23:15] be the thing you would price everything
[23:18] uh you would say hey the house costs
[23:20] today one Bitcoin and in 10 years it
[23:23] only cost two 0.2 Bitcoin whatever and
[23:26] that's what makes sense in the long run
[23:29] and you one Bitcoin is is a large amount
[23:34] we already talked about it in the
[23:35] beginning and I think it's much more uh
[23:38] when you want to see how valuable a
[23:40] Bitcoin in the future is I think it's
[23:42] much more interesting to look at the
[23:43] Block subsidy in the next few years and
[23:46] decades so the amount of Bitcoin that
[23:47] will continue to uh go go unlocked
[23:51] basically um we already have like I
[23:53] don't know 19.7 million Bitcoin that are
[23:57] available at the moment and the so the
[23:59] last 1.3 million Bitcoin we mind for the
[24:02] next 120 years around about and I me
[24:05] just we have 20 20 24 and when you look
[24:09] at I know 2044 basically in 20 years the
[24:12] block subsidy that will be every 10
[24:14] minutes round about there will be less
[24:16] than
[24:17] 0.0 uh 0.1 BTC that is being issued in
[24:22] just 20 years so that's uh that's um the
[24:26] world wars everyone in the world
[24:28] basically every minor will be competing
[24:30] for 10 minutes for this 0.1 BTC of
[24:34] course additional um transaction fees
[24:36] that will be rising but I think it's
[24:38] it's a number you can yeah imagine that
[24:41] it's really it's worth something and
[24:44] it's uh maybe worth more than people
[24:48] might imagine today uh yeah so I don't
[24:51] think it's necessary to be a wall coiner
[24:53] but one bitcoiner um it's better to I
[24:55] think it's better to start calculating
[24:57] zosi
[24:58] zoshi not in a world BTC because it's
[25:02] not everyone would be a zoshi bitcoiner
[25:06] w coiner but many people can be a zosi
[25:08] millionaire and I think that's more uh
[25:11] the
[25:11] approach I think even we need to break
[25:15] down if we really want to use Bitcoin
[25:16] one satosi into more units at some point
[25:19] at least um which is really interesting
[25:22] when what you talked about uh when
[25:23] people ask you what's the future market
[25:25] cap of of Bitcoin I get that question
[25:28] also um a lot especially from people
[25:31] that have no
[25:33] Bitcoin like oh yeah what but what like
[25:35] I'm in stocks like I always calcul
[25:37] what's the potential market cap of of a
[25:39] stock and I was also in that world like
[25:41] and I also looked at Bitcoin the first
[25:43] time like that because I came from that
[25:45] stock world so I get where the people
[25:47] are coming from um but it does not make
[25:50] sense uh if we calculate Bitcoin and
[25:52] Fiat because yeah Fiat will be gone at
[25:55] some point at least as as I see it
[25:58] uh but how does it make sense or how
[26:01] could we calculate what bitcoin's um
[26:04] full potential is because at some point
[26:07] most of the people will if if
[26:10] hyperbitcoinization is true at some
[26:12] point everyone will have Bitcoin and we
[26:14] transacting Bitcoin and then we kind of
[26:16] have reached uh bitcoin's full potential
[26:19] maybe we civilize other planets and then
[26:22] they also do Bitcoin so like it's an
[26:24] Infinity thing definitely uh but but you
[26:27] know what I mean like if if we reach all
[26:29] 10 billion people that might be on earth
[26:31] in I don't know 20 30 40 50 years um
[26:35] it's it's hard for me to calculate
[26:37] what's the full potential of Bitcoin if
[26:39] we are completely successful uh and the
[26:42] time frame is is impossible to to to
[26:45] suggest anyways they like those
[26:47] percentages model or like what have we
[26:49] now as as total net assets and what
[26:51] percentage can we reach how do you look
[26:52] at uh that how do you calculate that
[26:55] yeah also I mean for clickbait and
[26:57] forget views you
[26:59] sometimes or do some videos like hey
[27:01] Bitcoin could rise to put here some
[27:03] price and then people click on it and
[27:05] then I also show the market caps of you
[27:08] know the real estate market or the stock
[27:11] market bond market whatever B would
[27:13] basically just over take all of these
[27:15] and but you can't just say all this this
[27:17] Market is like I don't know 100 billion
[27:19] big and it would just go into Bitcoin
[27:21] and Bitcoin Will Rise by 100 billion
[27:24] that's not the case because Bitcoin
[27:25] there is the multiplier effect because
[27:27] bit is absolute scarcity there's uh for
[27:30] every dollar that's flowing into Bitcoin
[27:32] Bitcoin Rises for X amounts so I don't
[27:35] know maybe some banks calculated that is
[27:38] around I know 10 10x or something like
[27:41] that it's we round about and it just as
[27:44] scarer Bitcoin gets and as more people
[27:46] get Bitcoin and want to hold it and
[27:48] don't want to sell it for Euro there
[27:50] will the multiplier effect will steadily
[27:52] increase so one Euro or one dollar
[27:55] that's flowing into Bitcoin will make
[27:57] Bitcoin market cap much bigger and the
[27:59] Bitcoin price much bigger so you can say
[28:02] yeah when the real estate market is
[28:04] completely flooded by of course the real
[28:06] estate market still has a use case for
[28:09] being a a home but it wouldn't be an
[28:11] investment like that anymore like today
[28:13] in the Fiat world so yeah when all these
[28:15] uh things when Bitcoin over takes all
[28:18] these markets it doesn't make any sense
[28:20] to calculate it in Euro you need to
[28:22] calculate Bitcoin because I I don't see
[28:25] what really you can calculate the price
[28:27] of Bitcoin run I think but you can just
[28:29] say hey look at that and it also will
[28:32] yeah rise more than that maybe maybe we
[28:35] have to start calculating Bitcoin in in
[28:38] in Gold because gold will will be
[28:41] probably uh around but the the financial
[28:45] energy will also be sucked out of it
[28:47] maybe maybe it makes sense to like just
[28:49] compare it to Like Houses gold and and
[28:51] all those things like how many houses
[28:52] will you be able to buy with 0.1 Bitcoin
[28:55] those kind of comparisons that could be
[28:57] interesting but then there's like in
[28:58] what area are those houses and then how
[29:01] how good are the houses like like there
[29:03] there's a lot of weird things happening
[29:05] probably gold is the the the best
[29:08] calculator in in which we can calculate
[29:11] Bitcoin I think so too um I mean you can
[29:14] also say yeah when Bitcoin Rises to 10
[29:17] million someday but when Bitcoin is on
[29:20] at 1 billion at 10 10 million um the
[29:23] money that makes it rise to that price
[29:25] would also be uh yeah vacuumed from uh
[29:29] all the other assets like housing so you
[29:32] would have a bitcoin price of around 10
[29:34] million but the housing prices would
[29:36] also fall because this money is flowing
[29:39] into Bitcoin and you also need to
[29:41] calculate that it's yeah it's also I
[29:44] don't know it's uh quite interesting but
[29:47] you can come to a conclusion I think in
[29:50] the end how fast or which price Bitcoin
[29:53] will R reach at any point in time so uh
[29:57] trading isn't option I think absolutely
[30:00] yeah if you watch my podcast already for
[30:02] more than two times you know how
[30:05] extremely passionate I am about self-
[30:07] custody and the first very very very
[30:10] important step to self- custody is
[30:13] always getting yourself a hardware
[30:16] wallet and I have one for you here this
[30:19] is the Bitcoin only Edition from the
[30:21] bitbox my favorite single signature
[30:24] Hardware wallet on the market another
[30:26] really important piece of self- custody
[30:29] if you have a hardware wallet is the
[30:32] backup of the seed phrase and bitbox
[30:34] made the perfect solution to back up
[30:37] your seat phase they made a reusable
[30:40] steel wallet check out that beauty it's
[30:43] durable it extremely heavy if I put it
[30:46] on the desk I seriously feel for my own
[30:49] table it's so so heavy and durable I
[30:52] love it this is where my seed phrase is
[30:55] secure go to bitbox
[30:58] ss/ robobin to get your bitbox and if
[31:02] you use code Robin you even get 5% off
[31:06] of your complete order and the next step
[31:09] is to really level up your sovereignty
[31:11] as an individual you have to have the
[31:14] most secure self- custody setup you have
[31:17] to secure your own devices you have to
[31:20] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:23] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:25] where you live you even want to have a
[31:27] plan Plan B a citizenship where you can
[31:30] move in case something goes really
[31:32] really wrong and through all those steps
[31:34] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[31:36] step by step and if you visit the
[31:39] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[31:43] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[31:46] out how you can level up your
[31:48] sovereignty and last but not least I
[31:50] have something completely new for you
[31:53] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[31:57] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[32:00] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[32:03] look at that beauty I love it so much
[32:05] coin vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin
[32:09] watch that's the perfect subtle elegant
[32:11] way to go out there and show that you
[32:14] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[32:17] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[32:20] dropped a completely new and amazing
[32:23] Genesis edition of their watch
[32:26] collections you have to date of the
[32:28] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[32:31] and of course also the block height and
[32:34] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[32:37] level of detail they put in in this
[32:40] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[32:42] those amazing coin vigilante the time
[32:45] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[32:48] those watches so so much uh I I mean I I
[32:52] kind of have to ask at this point um
[32:54] what's your thoughts on on the Bitcoin
[32:55] power L power
[32:58] I I it's for I'm not that big into it
[33:03] but as far as I had it's more like the
[33:05] stuck to flow model I don't know it's um
[33:08] yeah then people say yeah but it's the
[33:10] power law is actually a real thing that
[33:13] exists I don't know it's it's uh it's
[33:16] just when you calculate prices for the
[33:19] future you can't be right maybe you
[33:21] might be right but it's it's just
[33:24] guessing maybe it's a better guess than
[33:27] just a I don't know throwing a I don't
[33:30] know going playing roulette or something
[33:32] like that but but it's it's not better
[33:35] it's not really better so I don't think
[33:37] much of that yeah it's interesting yeah
[33:40] it's it has very wide ranges also um so
[33:44] I'm like ah okay you could could be
[33:46] right and also I think the the some of
[33:50] the proponent say like it it it will
[33:51] break anyways at some point and and we
[33:53] have to keep updating it's like yeah
[33:55] okay then then it's like a little bit
[33:57] like the Onin analysts uh that can tell
[34:00] you about realized profits and
[34:01] unrealized profits and if we're in a
[34:03] bare Market or a bull market I mean if
[34:06] if you're um if you have the decision to
[34:09] make to make a big investment now or
[34:12] later and you can look at all the
[34:13] statistics and you're like okay now we
[34:15] are kind of in a bare Market versus
[34:16] we're kind of in the bull market maybe
[34:19] helps you to make decisions financially
[34:22] but honestly I would not even go that
[34:24] route down because most people probably
[34:26] everyone will get burn it when they do
[34:29] like that so I I it's fun to talk about
[34:33] uh and I had a lot of power law people
[34:35] already on H and it's really fascinating
[34:38] because there's like whole science
[34:40] things behind it and I only understand
[34:42] 10% of it but I would never trade my
[34:45] Bitcoin on on top of that there's also
[34:48] the point um if uh let's say you have a
[34:51] range of I don't know what's the power
[34:52] off for
[34:54] 2030 I don't know you
[34:57] 5 I think is the range between 500,000
[35:01] and 2 million I think that's something
[35:03] that I remembered I mean you always you
[35:06] just measuring these prices in in Euro
[35:08] or dollar that's doesn't make sense cuz
[35:11] uh yeah when the money supply Rises it's
[35:13] also you also need to calculate the
[35:15] inflation the money inflation and on the
[35:17] other side you also have I mean what
[35:19] would happen if the USA would say
[35:21] tomorrow hey we just bought I don't know
[35:23] two million Bitcoin we just Min them
[35:25] whatever we own them and we um just back
[35:28] the dollar with it somehow they don't
[35:30] need to have it exchangeable like with
[35:32] the gold standard but at least just buy
[35:34] as a treasury as a I forgot the word you
[35:37] know what I mean um then everyone would
[35:40] just start buying Bitcoin and the
[35:42] Bitcoin value would start and the last
[35:44] few I mean there are like I don't two
[35:46] million Bitcoin and exchanges or
[35:47] something like that and with these
[35:49] Bitcoin are gone it's like the Bitcoin
[35:51] price will just go up and then the power
[35:55] law is basically just I don't know it's
[35:57] a yeah I don't think that we I think we
[36:00] would then exceed the uh 2 million by
[36:03] 203 something so yeah like you said I
[36:07] wouldn't trade for that maybe yeah might
[36:09] have luck but which is a which is a
[36:12] little bit interesting more interesting
[36:14] to me is the power LW in Gold there's
[36:17] actually like a a Bitcoin power LW that
[36:19] is also based on gold versus not the US
[36:21] Dollars um which captures more of the
[36:26] actual growth of Bitcoin unless the the
[36:30] inflationary thing because I think the
[36:32] power LW in US Dollars will be broken
[36:33] just because of inflation and the the
[36:35] Bitcoin power maybe based on gold maybe
[36:37] it has but yeah as as you said I just I
[36:41] feel the obligation uh to all the power
[36:44] Advocates that already had was on my
[36:46] show that at least ask the question when
[36:48] when we come to that
[36:49] topic what my gu think about that I I I
[36:53] just want to everyone to know I would
[36:55] never trade on on that thing and even
[36:58] power Advocates said to that like don't
[37:00] sell your Bitcoin because of the power
[37:02] and I think that's a healthy uh thing to
[37:04] say if if you want to make the Bitcoin
[37:07] growth in the past more descriptive and
[37:09] more understandable why it grows like
[37:11] that yeah you can do that but uh don't
[37:14] uh don't get a loan of of Bitcoin for $5
[37:17] million in the next five years because
[37:19] the power says so uh that's probably a
[37:21] stupid thing to
[37:23] do but you made the the point that uh we
[37:26] will be at the point point where um
[37:29] Bitcoin doesn't uh isn't only like a
[37:32] small asset but could be the world
[37:34] Reserve asset I think the Strategic
[37:36] Reserve asset was also the word you was
[37:38] looking for before with the treasury of
[37:40] the states um do we actually have a
[37:43] chance of of separating money from State
[37:46] like we did with religion and other
[37:48] things yeah I think you already did
[37:50] somehow at least for I think for your
[37:52] part for my part we somehow did it for
[37:54] ourselves of course on the on the wide
[37:56] scale yeah we still have states to print
[37:58] money and also uh influence our life
[38:01] with that with f Fiat money but power is
[38:04] steadily going away I mean like you
[38:06] already talked few minutes earlier um
[38:09] people start to realize Lind effect is
[38:11] growing Network effect is growing people
[38:12] see Bitcoin is getting coming back every
[38:16] time every time stronger than before and
[38:19] people will just see hey this thing just
[38:22] doesn't seem to die and it just keep
[38:24] rising in price so I might get into it
[38:26] and then you have the whole Bitcoin
[38:28] rabbit story the people will get into
[38:30] Bitcoin and just put more time in it
[38:32] learn about it and everyone who holds
[38:35] Bitcoin is basically just opting out of
[38:37] the system and it's not like binary it's
[38:40] not you have uh you completely feat and
[38:42] then you're completely Bitcoin but
[38:44] you're going into Bitcoin a Bitcoin
[38:46] system and every I mean we can see it um
[38:50] every few years you can really see that
[38:53] many people come into the cycle and also
[38:55] stay there and don't disappear Peter so
[38:58] uh yeah I think that's um we just need
[39:02] to uh get bigger um on a also on a
[39:06] national level and we already already
[39:08] saw that uh in the I mean the USA have
[39:11] the biggest and most important Capital
[39:13] Market in the world um they have the
[39:15] world Reserve currency and yeah Donald
[39:18] Trump and other pres presidential
[39:20] candidates already talked about um yeah
[39:23] buying Bitcoin and um to as a strategic
[39:26] Reserve Reserve asset so we already are
[39:31] at the point in history I wouldn't have
[39:34] F like I would have said it's like 2030
[39:38] a presidential candidate would talk
[39:39] about that but we already had it now and
[39:42] I think it won't takes so long and
[39:44] people it's just Game Theory if just one
[39:47] bigger state says hey we are buying
[39:50] Bitcoin and we're backing our FIA
[39:52] currency with that it's over basically
[39:55] it's not over but it's a really heavily
[39:57] increasing the adoption rate and um then
[40:01] we have a I mean the real 100%
[40:05] completion of money in state I don't
[40:07] know if we will
[40:08] actually witness it with with our own
[40:11] eyes our own eyes but um in the future
[40:14] at least we will see how it uh will come
[40:18] to this let's say
[40:20] that it's it surprised also me at the
[40:23] whole like when I came into 2020 in
[40:25] Bitcoin uh I didn't had El Salvador in
[40:29] 2021 making it legal tender and now they
[40:32] start pying it like all the things kind
[40:34] of move very fast if if I'm honest did
[40:38] you see uh I think it was yesterday or
[40:40] even today on all my feeds that Trump
[40:43] made the first Bitcoin transaction and
[40:46] it was like the kind of the first actual
[40:49] United States president that made a a
[40:51] Bitcoin transaction yeah I saw the video
[40:55] but it was more like uh the first
[40:56] president candidate who stood next to
[40:59] some guys paying with
[41:01] Bitcoin I don't think he used it himself
[41:04] but at least you know he uses Bitcoin as
[41:06] marketing that's the point so doesn't
[41:08] matter what you think about Trump the
[41:10] presidential candidate is advertising
[41:13] with Bitcoin Bitcoin I I love the other
[41:16] video that came out of of it where he
[41:19] said like get your crypto Burgers get
[41:21] your Crypt burgers and someone in the
[41:23] back like it's a bitcom burger not a
[41:24] crypt
[41:26] burger and then again says yeah get your
[41:29] crypto burgers or St like that he keeps
[41:31] calling crypto
[41:32] yeah I I I think for him it's just the
[41:35] same word at that point like it's it's
[41:37] just like yeah Bitcoin crypto play with
[41:38] your things what did you think actually
[41:40] of of the significance of of Trump's
[41:44] speech and of of Trump's things that he
[41:46] said because it's like uh like two sides
[41:49] to like oh it's it's massive that he was
[41:51] even at the conference and then the
[41:52] other side's like oh he's a [ __ ] corner
[41:54] he doesn't know what he's talking about
[41:55] anyways so it's I think the symbol
[41:58] himself that he's at the conference a
[42:00] Bitcoin conference and speaking about
[42:01] Bitcoin and crypto I think that's a
[42:04] really big symbol but the speech would
[42:06] say it was the first Trump speech I
[42:08] listened to and I really um it didn't
[42:12] say anything really that uh blow my mind
[42:15] let's say that um
[42:17] so I think you also I mean there are
[42:20] other people like block trainer he says
[42:22] that Trump is really separating Bitcoin
[42:24] and crypto when he speaks about it he
[42:25] always says Bitcoin and crypto so he's
[42:27] not speaking about the crypto space so
[42:29] that's a good point but I don't think
[42:31] that he really gets what Bitcoin is he
[42:33] just use is just sees hey so many people
[42:36] use Bitcoin in my country and the I
[42:38] might just use it as advertising and
[42:41] talk to these voters and there are many
[42:43] voters who are bitcoiners and also
[42:44] crypto guys and I don't know it's it's
[42:47] um Trump is already working on a crypto
[42:49] project now um I don't get someone
[42:53] something with financial some buw you
[42:55] know and uh I really don't know what
[42:58] this is leading and heading um yeah so
[43:03] you can see with that that he isn't
[43:05] really at least a real bitcoiner let's
[43:08] say it that way or Bitcoin Maxi he is a
[43:11] more like a crypto guy um let's see how
[43:16] how it plays out let's call it that way
[43:18] I think his his [ __ ] going to read that
[43:20] he does is uh just uh um getting getting
[43:24] money for his campaign I don't know
[43:29] and but I think it's very bullish that
[43:31] if he comes if he becomes the president
[43:33] I think now it's like a little bit more
[43:35] on his side versus camela um if he comes
[43:38] to president then there's also Viv Ravi
[43:42] on his team and RFK on his team and
[43:45] those two people seem to understand
[43:47] Bitcoin on a way deeper level uh they
[43:50] they're not a full Bitcoin Maxes but
[43:52] they are uh way deeper already down the
[43:55] rabbit hole and you could see in the
[43:57] especially in the speech of RFK I was I
[43:59] was seeing the whole speech and I was
[44:01] like impressed by him when you compare
[44:03] that speech to the one year or G speech
[44:05] that was like a massive increase in
[44:07] knowledge like he really um learned a
[44:10] lot or at least got to learn a lot um
[44:14] and they they are way way more down the
[44:16] rabbit hole and just my hope is uh like
[44:19] I don't care who's going to be the
[44:21] president of America because like I'm
[44:23] not in America uh but but uh if if they
[44:27] if that's the administration and there
[44:29] are like two three really big Bitcoin
[44:31] advocates in there that might influence
[44:34] the president's decision uh that that
[44:36] might just accelerate the Bitcoin
[44:38] adoption even if camela even I have a
[44:41] small group a telegram group where I
[44:42] talk with with people on a daily basis
[44:44] and and and that we have a discussion
[44:46] now going on if if for the Bitcoin
[44:49] adoption it might even be bet better if
[44:51] CA Harris is in there because there
[44:53] might be more money Printing and might
[44:54] be more chaos but I'm like no there will
[44:56] be still a lot of chaos with Trump also
[44:58] yeah I don't really know who's better
[45:00] for Bitcoin in the in the long run um
[45:03] but there's also the point every
[45:07] bitcoiner you know basically uh I don't
[45:09] know a Bitcoin Bitcoin myself who uh
[45:12] stopped being a bitcoiner maybe they
[45:14] aren't interested in Bitcoin that that
[45:17] uh like like in the past but they're
[45:20] still bitcoiners and uh when you
[45:22] consider that there are already Bitcoin
[45:24] Maxis in the Trump Administration
[45:28] um how would it look in 5 years or four
[45:31] years there just would I mean these
[45:34] people already understands Bitcoin at a
[45:36] deeper level and it will just increase I
[45:38] think and there will just be more people
[45:40] understanding it and more people saying
[45:42] hey let's buy this let's get let's get
[45:44] ahead of other countries and um this is
[45:47] happening worldwide right now and um
[45:50] just because of the speech Trump did and
[45:52] also RFK um it's now a topic for every
[45:56] other at least every other uh um I don't
[46:00] know government at least should look at
[46:02] it and yeah just just consider hey there
[46:05] is a potential uh president talking
[46:08] about Bitcoin and uh that might be
[46:11] interesting for us
[46:13] too so let's see how it happs and that's
[46:16] really interesting uh point it's uh when
[46:19] when you said ahead of other countes I
[46:21] immediately thought of the European
[46:23] Union and and uh how I basically had
[46:28] heard nothing in the EU election and
[46:30] even like now Austria has has elections
[46:32] uh I I don't hear anything about Bitcoin
[46:35] like not even a little bit not even
[46:37] negative things I didn't I just don't
[46:39] hear anything which is the most con
[46:41] concerning for me uh for the European
[46:43] Union um is there any uh because you're
[46:46] in Germany is there any talk in in
[46:47] Germany or did you see hear anything
[46:49] about the EU and what's your what's your
[46:51] take on the Americans are already
[46:53] talking a lot about uh Bitcoin and there
[46:56] are presidents that visit like py uh
[46:58] bars and and all those things and they
[47:01] speaking at the Bitcoin conferences
[47:03] versus yes we also have Bitcoin conferen
[47:05] in Europe there are politicians there
[47:08] like Trana katar uh who she is there and
[47:11] some other people but not like really
[47:14] high
[47:15] ranking um in the executive branch uh
[47:19] politicians uh so like what's your take
[47:21] on that uh we might have a faster
[47:25] separation of money in state here in
[47:26] Europe maybe because when you look at
[47:28] the EU they don't talk like I said you
[47:31] don't talk about Bitcoin it's they
[47:33] really have no clue and uh I don't think
[47:35] there's a master plan behind it I really
[47:37] think they don't have a clue and uh
[47:39] they're getting in trouble in the future
[47:42] and um but when you look in Germany or
[47:45] the world German speaking so also
[47:46] Austria and swiss um we can see that
[47:49] when at least when you you can't really
[47:51] say there are so many bitcoiners but
[47:53] like block trainer he's a German
[47:55] speaking guy and he has I think even the
[47:57] largest ger Bitcoin only education
[48:00] Channel on YouTube so that's a really
[48:02] big thing and when you look at the
[48:04] Bitcoin notes Bitcoin full notes of
[48:05] course you can't really know really it's
[48:08] just roundabout numbers but you can see
[48:11] that uh the Germans almost have as as
[48:14] much as many Bitcoin full notes like the
[48:16] Americans the USA guys but uh yeah USA
[48:20] has like more than double the amount of
[48:23] people there so um when it comes to big
[48:26] Corners per head um the Germans are
[48:29] really maybe leading worldwide I don't
[48:32] know and when you look at the government
[48:34] at the same time they don't have a clue
[48:36] they really don't do anything about
[48:38] Bitcoin they also talked about banning
[48:41] proof of work and so on but it got
[48:43] cancelled as far as I know there might
[48:45] be some back doors but let's hope it
[48:48] doesn't come that far but at least they
[48:51] just don't do anything good or bad about
[48:53] Bitcoin
[48:54] so it can State way
[48:57] uh in my opinion but um yeah I think
[49:00] that's interesting yeah it's really
[49:01] interesting that the German community is
[49:03] so strong uh the only YouTube channel
[49:06] educational Bitcoin only channel that is
[49:07] bigger than blog trainer that I know of
[49:10] uh is Bitcoin sessions uh BDC sessions
[49:13] with Ben he has I think like 350,000
[49:17] followers or subscribers and block
[49:19] trainer has like around 200,000 if we
[49:21] only just count the followers I don't
[49:23] know if the other metrics where blocker
[49:24] might be better than PDC sessions but
[49:27] it's extremely uh impressive how uh
[49:31] strong and big the the the German
[49:34] community is like that's uh that it's
[49:36] it's under I think it's underrated how
[49:39] many small content creators like it's
[49:42] not just like there are two three big
[49:43] ones like there's a huge community and
[49:47] and H I was thinking that's all around
[49:50] like that but now with my podcast when I
[49:53] interview so many people all around the
[49:54] world that's unique the German Bitcoin
[49:57] space like that's really unique to have
[49:59] such an amazing um Community uh of of of
[50:03] bitcoiners I I only saw it when once I
[50:06] got in touch with uh Indian uh content
[50:09] creators where I'm like oh Indian is a
[50:11] massive Market but there are not so many
[50:14] really great uh Indian uh YouTube
[50:17] Bitcoin only content creators I mean
[50:19] they they fought for even a Bitcoin only
[50:21] exchange for for a long time now they
[50:23] have they have some and only in the
[50:26] Germans area there are a lot of Bitcoin
[50:27] only exchanges like that's that's like
[50:29] massive what what the developments in in
[50:32] Germany are like that that gives me hope
[50:34] but then I listen to the politicians and
[50:35] I'm
[50:36] like I don't know that's you also need
[50:40] to consider the 21 or iron swans group
[50:43] or not a group it's the movement or
[50:45] however you want to call it it's like
[50:47] the Bitcoin meetups and when you look at
[50:49] the German map I know span or 21 there
[50:52] are so many meetups like everywhere in
[50:53] Germany you can go somewhere like at
[50:55] least once a month
[50:57] and talk with common bit coiners not
[50:59] shade coers and that's really that's
[51:01] really big and when you look at the
[51:02] world map I mean I don't know what I
[51:05] would do when I'm in France or I don't
[51:08] know Greece or I don't know somewhere
[51:10] else in the world and there aren't that
[51:11] meetups as far as I know maybe some big
[51:14] towns or big cities but uh not not that
[51:17] common like it's in Germany that they
[51:19] really I don't know how many meetups
[51:21] there are in Germany right now but it's
[51:23] a maybe yeah over 50 let's say I guess
[51:28] over 50 at least yeah like like there's
[51:30] even in small cities in in Austria
[51:34] things I'm I just try to quickly see it
[51:37] up but there are a lot of yeah like
[51:39] there are a lot of points here I I saw
[51:42] the I see the map now uh but there are a
[51:44] lot of points there even like in Spain
[51:47] uh there's in Mala one uh they are like
[51:51] basically German yeah
[51:53] yeah Istanbul
[51:56] Bulgaria yeah Poland Sweden yeah there
[51:59] there are a lot of really cool didn't
[52:02] knew that they were so International
[52:03] even yeah really cool one other topic
[52:06] that I want to discuss before we come to
[52:07] the end routine of the podcast um we
[52:10] know how huge the impact that Bitcoin
[52:13] has on the on the financial system will
[52:16] be um what do you think or where do you
[52:19] think Bitcoin will also have a huge
[52:20] impact outside of the financial system
[52:23] or will it only be affecting uh money um
[52:26] basically money is time or money is
[52:29] basically every it's just a lifetime so
[52:32] it's also has a much bigger effect than
[52:34] just financially it's also when you talk
[52:37] to bitcoiners they also every bitcoiner
[52:40] basically is just happy he's positive
[52:42] looking in to a bright future and uh
[52:46] yeah when you talk with other people
[52:48] other not coiners it's uh isn't like
[52:51] that I would say in the majority of
[52:52] people so um you can see that people are
[52:55] developing um um just more healthy
[52:58] lifestyle uh they developing a lower
[53:00] time
[53:01] Preference they just start to realize
[53:04] hey I can just start saving a Bitcoin
[53:08] work hard saveing Bitcoin and I can
[53:10] actually retire on that or buy a home
[53:12] someday and that's just not possible
[53:15] with Fiat money so it just gives you it
[53:17] gives you hope it gives you a better
[53:19] life a healthier life healthier whatever
[53:21] so it's a it's the biggest maybe the
[53:25] biggest thing that could improve Society
[53:27] on a general
[53:29] level I like that a lot and I I I think
[53:33] so too um I I will be speaking actually
[53:36] about that topic uh uh live in 25 I
[53:39] think it's called in Bitcoin Amsterdam
[53:41] really looking forward to that um yeah
[53:43] really cool um the the last end routine
[53:46] uh of the podcast is always one question
[53:47] that is always the same for every guest
[53:49] and one question from the previous guest
[53:51] the one question is always the same for
[53:52] every guest what can we learn from you
[53:54] besides Bitcoin and all the things that
[53:56] that we already talked about for me um I
[53:59] don't know it's I'm not that interesting
[54:01] I need to say but maybe that's the point
[54:05] yeah maybe if even if you're just some
[54:07] guy some random guy you can uh I mean
[54:10] people write me in private hey you I was
[54:12] a [ __ ] coiner or I didn't know anything
[54:15] about money or so and uh just some I saw
[54:18] some of your videos and you really
[54:19] changed my life you I was depressive and
[54:22] so on and now I'm feeling much better
[54:24] and I see hey there's EX might be a
[54:26] better life in the future or maybe now
[54:28] even at the moment and it's developing
[54:30] and it just gives people help so even if
[54:32] you're just some random guy you can just
[54:36] uh study Bitcoin uh spread the word
[54:39] educate people on bitcoin educate people
[54:42] on bitcoin who want to be educated so
[54:44] it's also a big part I think and you can
[54:47] improve people's life uh and that that's
[54:51] just something really that makes me
[54:53] happy it's you read these me messages
[54:55] and it's like hey that's uh really
[54:57] really how would say it heartwarming or
[55:00] something like that yeah that's great it
[55:03] makes it makes an impact it's that's
[55:05] really cool yeah for for me you are the
[55:07] the German Matthew crer like you're
[55:09] you're really cool and and your videos
[55:10] are um like not not like uh so traumatic
[55:15] and so like oh see this and it's
[55:17] crashing no like it's it's a it's a calm
[55:20] way of explaining Bitcoin and all the
[55:21] things that going on and uh with a
[55:24] little bit of humor here and there like
[55:26] it's it's really great to see I love
[55:28] Matthew K and the Bitcoin University and
[55:30] I love your content it's really great to
[55:33] to have so many great uh people in in
[55:36] the space the the last end routine is
[55:38] where the previous guest is asking a
[55:40] question for the next
[55:41] guest and it's a it's an interesting
[55:44] question H I'm not responsible for those
[55:46] questions the questions come from the
[55:49] pr um Finn are you making babies yet no
[55:54] not yet
[55:57] yeah that's that's a short question yeah
[56:00] that's a very short question yeah um she
[56:02] was um Katy Katy from uh the the BL B
[56:07] bport uh and and she talked about
[56:09] motherhood in the end of the podcast uh
[56:12] and when we stopped recording uh she
[56:14] directly got her baby because she heard
[56:16] it in the other room uh and and I think
[56:19] that that that that probably influenced
[56:22] her question a little
[56:24] bit so that
[56:27] uh maybe I can alter the the the the
[56:31] question a little bit did you look into
[56:34] flag Theory and plan B passport for
[56:36] yourself I mean you have I assume you
[56:40] have a German passport and you have a
[56:42] strong passport therefore um did you in
[56:45] because of that still look into flag
[56:48] Fury yes um so I mean I live in Germany
[56:52] I'm German so um Germans always complain
[56:55] all the time but but uh in the end it's
[56:57] in ger really it's not that bad in
[57:00] Germany yet it's getting better uh worse
[57:03] and so on but in the end we're when you
[57:05] compare to the rest of the world we're
[57:07] still living a good life here but I'm
[57:09] also um of course I'm keeping my eye
[57:11] open so I'm uh maybe I'm deciding to
[57:14] move still in Germany but Southwest more
[57:18] and uh also um trying to uh visit um m
[57:22] not not Madera uh but the
[57:26] FAL what what was it um mad yeah it's
[57:29] Madera yeah I'm stupid I wanted to visit
[57:32] the Madera Conference next year and just
[57:34] see how it I don't know how the island
[57:37] is I've never been there and um just
[57:41] keep an eye open but I'm really not sure
[57:45] where I could move as a plan B um it's
[57:50] everything has their Pro and cons and um
[57:53] yeah I didn't make a decision yet but
[57:55] I'm keeping my open at least let's say
[57:57] that or is it next year also I I thought
[58:00] it's only all four years oh I have to
[58:03] look at
[58:05] it I thought the Bitcoin is only uh all
[58:10] four years but it it could be next year
[58:12] also like I hope it's next year because
[58:14] I was missing it this year and I was
[58:15] like oh I really want to go next year uh
[58:18] and then people told me oh no it's only
[58:21] all four years uh so I I hope I hope
[58:23] you're right it's next year then we can
[58:25] make our own meet up there yeah next
[58:27] year yeah just like make our own um a
[58:30] conference there like you and I the only
