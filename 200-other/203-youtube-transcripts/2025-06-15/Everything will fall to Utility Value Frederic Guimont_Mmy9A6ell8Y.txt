[00:00] art will find its real price in the
[00:02] coming years when we stop using it as a
[00:04] hedge same with real estate Trudeau has
[00:06] orange bued a lot of people by seizing
[00:09] people's bank accounts because they
[00:11] wanted to support a trucker movement a
[00:13] lot of people realize that whoa okay my
[00:15] bank account is not so secure now so I
[00:17] better find something that is secure
[00:19] there's a huge kind of potential between
[00:21] Ai and Bitcoin because AI can't have
[00:24] bank account but it can have a Bitcoin
[00:26] wallet it's a possibility that I am EI
[00:29] there was no Bitcoin superhero comic I'm
[00:31] creating the first one you can have
[00:33] sales through lightning you can have
[00:36] zaps now with micro payments now is a
[00:38] great time to start building the culture
[00:40] around
[00:42] [Music]
[00:44] Bitcoin what are you saying to to the
[00:47] developments in Canada with with Bitcoin
[00:49] I mean who look who is the one that is
[00:52] in charge now true do who not not a fan
[00:55] of of Bitcoin but there's elections I
[00:57] think next year coming up yeah and
[00:59] Trudeau is like has orange pilled a lot
[01:01] of people by seizing people's bank
[01:04] accounts because they wanted to support
[01:06] a trucker movement so a lot of people
[01:08] realize that whoa okay my bank account
[01:10] is not so secure now so I better find
[01:13] something that is secured and uh Bitcoin
[01:15] is is kind of like that offramp so they
[01:19] they kind of got orange built by a
[01:21] non-bitcoin which happens a lot of time
[01:23] did you know someone that was in the
[01:25] trackout protest that actually got uh
[01:28] the account Frozen
[01:31] uh no fortunately uh everyone that I
[01:33] know was fine but I did read about it in
[01:35] the news and uh there was like a lot of
[01:38] reports and all I know that all the
[01:40] money that was donated through Fiat
[01:43] means uh that is like kickstarters and
[01:45] all that I don't know the exact names of
[01:47] the uh uh Services used but I know that
[01:50] the Fiat means were seized and the only
[01:53] money that made it through to the
[01:54] truckers wor Bitcoin uh because that
[01:57] could not be uh you know you cannot
[02:00] intervene top down with authority and
[02:02] call it off Bitcoin is uh you know
[02:04] uncensorable I also heard that they got
[02:08] Bitcoin but only those of course who got
[02:10] it on Exchange on on third parties uh
[02:14] which also makes then the the thing that
[02:16] we actually have to self custody our
[02:19] Bitcoin so much more important so even
[02:21] bitcoiners who was already orange built
[02:23] uh kind of got a lesson from Trudeau
[02:25] don't keep it on third parties exactly
[02:28] and they even went after a while wet uh
[02:31] not really understanding well I forget
[02:33] what what the company is for the wallet
[02:34] but they didn't understand that that
[02:37] wallet wasn't actually hosting its
[02:38] clients coins it was only like creating
[02:41] cryptographic keys and all that so
[02:44] they're trying to sees over there did
[02:47] not even make sense so you can tell that
[02:49] they're still a little bit behind the
[02:50] game they don't understand or they're
[02:52] starting to understand how how this is
[02:55] not seizable this is something they
[02:56] can't control it's starting to to to
[02:59] work um but you're coming from from an
[03:01] art world uh uh what are you doing
[03:04] you're doing superheroes in in in in
[03:07] comic or in in Bitcoin style exactly
[03:10] it's uh I grew up reading comic books of
[03:14] all kinds you know like from the French
[03:15] Bond disy of Europe to uh the American
[03:18] comic book superhero stuff and I really
[03:20] loved it you know moved around a lot as
[03:22] a kid so spent a lot of time with books
[03:24] and have a
[03:26] really good uh big big love for the
[03:29] medium and develop skills and talents
[03:32] for that but I could never make it uh
[03:34] before in the Fiat world like there was
[03:36] too hard to make things work uh
[03:39] financially and getting a job and uh
[03:43] keeping a stable life as an artist so I
[03:46] kind of flipped and switched to a like a
[03:49] developer career for part of my life
[03:52] half of my life and did a lot of
[03:54] front-end work on the web and all that
[03:56] and you know that that was an easier way
[03:58] to make uh things happen and then I
[04:02] discovered
[04:03] Bitcoin and at the same time I I was
[04:06] losing my job as a front end because the
[04:08] company was closing and I got really
[04:10] into Bitcoin at that point learning what
[04:11] it was and uh again first of all liking
[04:15] the fact that it couldn't be seized but
[04:17] then I got in early 2017 and that's kind
[04:20] of like just the beginning of the wave
[04:21] and we had a huge bull run from $1,000
[04:25] up to $20,000 so was kind of impressive
[04:29] uh time to just jump in Bitcoin as well
[04:31] so I learned how the technology worked
[04:34] which is what kind of got me to trust
[04:37] Bitcoin in the first place then learned
[04:39] how to get it off exchanges I think it
[04:40] took me like seven months before I could
[04:42] get it off uh
[04:44] coinbase and uh at the same time like
[04:47] Forks were exploding at that time like
[04:49] Bitcoin cash had just come out had
[04:51] Bitcoin Pizza Bitcoin gold everyone was
[04:53] making their own Bitcoin in early at the
[04:56] end of 2017 early 2018 it was a crazy
[04:59] time yeah so slowly it's I'm just you
[05:02] know with Bitcoin I'm kind of have more
[05:04] of my time and have turned an eye back
[05:07] to my original passion which is comics
[05:10] and uh seeing the state of comics right
[05:11] now and all that I I kind of felt like
[05:14] uh we needed a new uh superhero and uh
[05:17] Bitcoin didn't have its own superhero so
[05:19] I thought that would be a great uh a
[05:22] great matchup you know uh a real Maxi
[05:26] Bitcoin superhero uh where you know
[05:28] Batman has uh the old style Wayne
[05:32] Enterprises Corporation very you know
[05:34] stuck in the Fiat world doing we don't
[05:37] we're not sure what but uh our hero is
[05:39] much more simpler he has just a
[05:41] utxo and he has access to a dark web web
[05:45] Silk Road type interface where he can uh
[05:49] you know acquire superhero gear and uh
[05:52] get to do his own crime fighting so it's
[05:55] still very much like a action-based uh
[05:58] comic book but the underly Ling uh
[06:00] principles of the main character is uh
[06:03] you know surrounds Bitcoin and has been
[06:05] coin mentality um yeah we even time the
[06:10] moments in time in the comic are going
[06:11] to be displayed in block height just to
[06:14] keep into the character's heads space of
[06:17] being a an all-in bitcoiner if you will
[06:19] do you already have a a name for the
[06:22] superhero yeah so his name is rattel so
[06:26] rattel is the French name for
[06:28] Honeybadger so I wanted to go something
[06:31] that was you know going to recognize
[06:34] bitcoin's mascot of the Honeybadger and
[06:36] at the same time since I live in the
[06:38] French Province I thought the French
[06:40] name would be interesting and would
[06:41] differentiate from uh because
[06:43] Honeybadger is used uh prominently as it
[06:46] should being the mascot but by changing
[06:49] the but using the French version of the
[06:50] name it gives the superhero a unique uh
[06:53] name in the space and you are right now
[06:57] in the process of of of writing that
[06:59] like what kind of a crimes do do does
[07:03] rattel fight what what do you want to
[07:06] get across as a message in in those
[07:08] Comics so he he attacks the banking
[07:11] system and uh is kind of a little bit of
[07:14] a hacker mentality but he gets caught
[07:16] and he gets sent to Jail uh in the first
[07:18] book but at the time moment he got
[07:21] caught he had a his bip 39 the seed
[07:24] phrase in his head uh as we refer it to
[07:28] it as a head wallet or brain wallet so
[07:31] he went into prison remembering his 12
[07:33] seed words and by keeping that in his
[07:37] memory he was holding on to his Finance
[07:39] throughout all of his time in prison and
[07:41] when he comes out he comes out with this
[07:43] Fortune but he's remained Anonymous at
[07:46] the same time no one knows what he has
[07:48] access to and he makes his way back into
[07:51] society and tries to seeks to find the
[07:54] most Freedom he can in this world where
[07:56] he's been thrown into and at the same
[07:58] time tried to write the wrongs that he
[08:01] uh comes across whether in the banking
[08:03] system or whatever uh he may come across
[08:07] uh as we find in the first episode he
[08:09] stumbles onto a a a Russian spy who has
[08:13] uh psychic powers and she's being chased
[08:16] down by two goons and um it's going to
[08:19] be an interesting take because uh how
[08:22] can you protect your seed phrase in your
[08:24] head if you have a psychic spy trying to
[08:27] get inside your head and steal your your
[08:29] memories and your ideas so I want to
[08:32] play around with the concepts and
[08:34] bringing the superhero world into
[08:36] Bitcoin and vice versa and I think it's
[08:38] going to be an interesting
[08:41] Intrigue could also be an interesting
[08:44] educational platform even for uh for
[08:48] younger folks for people that are maybe
[08:51] even under 15 for for kids uh as they
[08:55] usually really like comic books like
[08:57] comic books are popular across all ages
[09:01] usually but especially with kids they're
[09:03] really popular yeah absolutely like it's
[09:06] really geared toward young men but
[09:08] anyone else can jump into the story and
[09:10] enjoy it but yeah it's the kind of like
[09:13] you know power fantasy of coming up uh
[09:16] in a world where you're restrained and
[09:17] then having access to a lot of power
[09:19] suddenly and trying to find your way
[09:22] throughout that with the responsibility
[09:24] that is put on you at the same time
[09:26] because when you have access to you know
[09:29] great strength or great resources your
[09:31] view of the world shifts and your
[09:33] relationship to it also gets redefined
[09:37] so in in that sense how can art and the
[09:42] comic that you are building maybe even
[09:45] help us or help uh the world to
[09:48] understand Bitcoin better well I think
[09:51] that it's going to introduce a lot of
[09:53] the advantages of Bitcoin that don't
[09:55] seem um relevant to some people like
[09:57] being able to memorize a seed phrase uh
[10:00] is not something that everybody's going
[10:02] to use in their daily life uh you know
[10:04] you're going to want to put it down on a
[10:06] steel plate or something secure like
[10:08] that uh but by putting it into a
[10:11] Fantastical uh scenery and an action
[10:13] setting and all that it kind of
[10:15] romanticizes the uh resource but
[10:17] actually so actually shows you examples
[10:21] of how it can be used in extreme
[10:23] situations and how powerful it really is
[10:25] so I think it's going to be interesting
[10:26] for yeah young bitcoiners growing up not
[10:29] knowing all the properties of Bitcoin
[10:32] yet to be able to uh discover them uh in
[10:34] an action setting like that can be a lot
[10:36] of fun you know it's definitely not
[10:38] going to be a how do you say an
[10:40] educational story but it is you will
[10:42] learn uh as You observe the character
[10:45] and how he behaves and how he uses
[10:47] Bitcoin in his role as a as a crime
[10:50] fighter how did you come up with uh that
[10:52] idea it's brilliant because I I never
[10:56] heard that anyone else doing so I feel
[10:59] like that's a really unique thing uh to
[11:01] do um how did you come up with that
[11:05] well it really came naturally as a as
[11:09] the idea of like um because I'm I'm
[11:11] myself obsessed with Bitcoin so by
[11:13] creating a superhero it was kind of
[11:16] normal to download this Maxi mentality
[11:20] that I was uh you know discovering
[11:22] through Twitter and with other
[11:24] bitcoiners around me so it only made
[11:26] sense to me and uh I kind of a character
[11:30] who I wanted to be able to move around
[11:33] the city kind of like Spider-Man
[11:35] Spider-Man kind of swings on the web so
[11:37] I put him on a a hoverboard so basically
[11:39] he has a a bigger drone that's kind of a
[11:42] half drone half skateboard that he can
[11:44] fly on throughout the city so give him a
[11:47] little bit of a resource and tools and
[11:50] fancy gear that uh will give him an edge
[11:53] in the fight so gave him the look gave
[11:56] him the the way that he was going to you
[11:59] know use his tools to fight crime and
[12:02] the fact that you could use Bitcoin for
[12:04] that just made a lot of sense uh he's
[12:06] coming out of jail so he can't have a
[12:08] bank account with a lot of money in it
[12:10] but he can keep his utxo stack hidden he
[12:13] can like work his way around it and he
[12:16] uses the tools of the criminals that he
[12:18] learned in prison but he himself kept
[12:21] his uh Integrity so he does not want to
[12:25] be a criminal he's kind of breaking some
[12:27] laws unwi you know
[12:29] uh with ethical concerns in mind at the
[12:32] same time trying to make the world
[12:33] better in the way that he understands it
[12:36] but uh that's going to be a bit of a
[12:38] psychological Intrigue as well like the
[12:40] in inner Battle of you know trying to be
[12:45] an example for other people and at the
[12:47] same time living in the world we live
[12:49] having to fight the battles that we have
[12:50] to fight that are sometimes thrown Upon
[12:52] Us does rattel fight um for the good in
[12:57] the world or does rattel also fight for
[13:01] Bitcoin well that's an interesting
[13:03] question because he's a minor at heart
[13:05] so he's got his mining equipment and all
[13:08] that uh but when he goes out on the
[13:10] streets and surveils I think he it's uh
[13:14] it goes beyond that it goes beyond it
[13:16] goes right down to just helping people
[13:18] who are in need regardless of uh the
[13:20] financial system and all
[13:23] that but uh for sure he has a mission
[13:26] he's mining he's part of the Bitcoin
[13:28] ecos system his crab fighting identity
[13:31] is going to be on Noster because it
[13:33] can't be traced back through the
[13:34] cryptographic keys so it's going to be
[13:37] an interesting new twist using
[13:39] censorship resistant media and money and
[13:44] Adventures that were kind of used to
[13:45] seeing but in a new light with a modern
[13:48] Twist on them and for the first time
[13:50] we're seeing bitcoiners uh a bit push to
[13:53] the extreme if you will in a fictional
[13:55] setting I mean I like it a lot uh the
[13:59] this thing what what um when you talk
[14:02] about when you write or when you design
[14:04] those Comics you kind of have to give
[14:07] Bitcoin a role is is is in the in this
[14:11] comic the role of Bitcoin a similar to
[14:13] what it is now or do you think in the
[14:16] comic already a little bit further down
[14:18] the line where Bitcoin is more mature
[14:20] and more already kind of a medium of
[14:23] exchange uh or how evolved is the field
[14:26] system in in that sense do do you also
[14:29] play with that prediction or like how
[14:31] Bitcoin could be in in the future World
[14:34] um the setting is set in the epoch four
[14:39] so prior to block height 840,000 and
[14:44] that throws us back into 2023 so it
[14:47] takes place last year in the events of
[14:49] yet last year and the story starts there
[14:51] but it's going to grow so as the story
[14:53] grow because it's Meant To Be A Serial
[14:55] story but so it can grow within time but
[14:58] it's not said in the future but we can
[14:59] definitely have uh visions of the future
[15:01] like there's definitely memes of Bitcoin
[15:05] that I want to uh add to the story I
[15:07] don't know have you ever heard of the
[15:09] Bitcoin time traveler for example oh no
[15:12] I did not okay so this is a story that
[15:15] popped up on Reddit and it was
[15:17] interesting uh I think I've discovered
[15:19] it in 2017 around that time and it's
[15:21] basically someone who claimed he was
[15:23] time traveling and was explaining how
[15:25] Bitcoin is going to is going to work and
[15:27] uh it's going to take on but it's not
[15:29] necessarily a good thing and he
[15:31] explained how high the price is going to
[15:32] be every cycle and then explains how the
[15:35] world is going to turn into a a sort of
[15:38] uh almost an apocalypse and he he's the
[15:41] one that brings about the concept of
[15:43] citadels you've probably heard of
[15:45] Bitcoin
[15:46] citadels yes of course yeah I think that
[15:49] traces back to the time traveler story
[15:52] so he's the one that says bitcoiners
[15:54] will have to be protected inside
[15:56] citadels uh against you know the the
[15:58] common folk who are are going to be
[16:00] living in this apocalypse so this is
[16:02] just a post that was posted on Reddit
[16:04] but it was it's interestingly part of
[16:06] the lore so I want to take some of these
[16:08] fun ideas and play around with them and
[16:11] add them in the story so there's future
[16:13] elements that we can ponder about there
[16:16] and um definitely have some fun with it
[16:18] for
[16:19] sure interesting and when it's a cereal
[16:23] that plays um almost in the present I
[16:26] mean we are now in 2094 so it it
[16:29] place in the the the past um do you
[16:33] consider adding real world events and
[16:37] making uh that Adventures like maybe
[16:41] adding the now right now there was the
[16:44] Nashville conference where the president
[16:45] talked about Bitcoin adding that and
[16:48] making some f fun thing about it maybe
[16:51] the the shot of the president and uh the
[16:55] Rotel came to rescue him or something
[16:57] like that so he was not shot us do you
[17:00] plan to actually introduce real world uh
[17:03] uh events into the comic uh yes and no
[17:06] cuz at the same time that the story
[17:08] takes place in our real world I don't
[17:10] want to uh put the focus on politics or
[17:15] real world events too much because I
[17:17] wanted to remain kind of an escape like
[17:20] a f it's it's a fantasy even though it's
[17:22] said in the real world so I kind of want
[17:24] to keep it on the fictitious characters
[17:27] and the fantasy of it a lot
[17:29] and steer clear from politics one way or
[17:32] the other but the events that happen for
[17:34] sure the events that happen will happen
[17:37] in the story as well and there will be
[17:38] impact uh upon it and uh I don't want to
[17:42] leave those out and I want the world to
[17:45] very much feel real but I don't want us
[17:47] to get like swept up into the politics
[17:48] of it either so I'm going to try to keep
[17:50] a balance somewhere in there I think it
[17:53] would be uh amazing if if as is an
[17:56] escape to maybe uh uh do it like in in
[18:01] in like 50 years in the future uh and
[18:04] and like Bitcoin is more developed it
[18:06] would been interesting I had some some
[18:08] guest on who also writes fictional
[18:11] novels uh and he imagined the world
[18:15] where the rats took over uh the world
[18:18] and they are no longer humans and uh
[18:21] Bitcoin is kind of the this absolutely
[18:24] developed uh thing that we used to even
[18:29] make time between different planets that
[18:31] we already are on and so this is this
[18:35] was really interesting because he put
[18:37] some fictional stuff in there but he
[18:39] also put some things that actually could
[18:41] happen in there and gave kind of like a
[18:44] let the mind a little bit open up to the
[18:47] idea that there's there's more to that
[18:49] and and what could happen uh so is is
[18:51] there something in in in your head that
[18:53] like maybe you do also like uh stories
[18:56] or fictions around what happens in in 50
[19:00] years or like even like thousand years
[19:02] maybe in the future because it's like a
[19:03] fictional comic so you can go really far
[19:06] with the creativity for sure for sure
[19:08] there's a lot of possibility because I
[19:10] do want to revisit the past of his story
[19:12] as well because I go quickly through
[19:14] what he experienced but there's room to
[19:16] go back and flashback so why couldn't we
[19:18] go and uh see the future as well and
[19:21] when you mention like fictional elements
[19:23] and things like that it reminds me a lot
[19:25] of the there's a huge kind of potential
[19:28] between between Ai and Bitcoin because
[19:31] AI can't have bank account but it can
[19:33] have a Bitcoin wallet no issue and
[19:36] control it and be able to
[19:38] hire people or pay for expenses and
[19:41] things like that and AI can quickly
[19:43] become autonomous with uh with Bitcoin
[19:46] which makes makes for you know a great
[19:49] case for a Fantastical story especially
[19:52] if you want to insert you know the
[19:54] doomster kind of side to AI which post
[19:58] is a real threat if it's in the wrong
[20:00] hands and things like that but uh it's
[20:03] absolutely a Fantastical chapter or
[20:05] character to to explore as well
[20:08] potential huge fantastic outcomes that
[20:11] could happen with that it's
[20:15] crazy did you dive deeper into um
[20:18] Bitcoin and AI it's such an interesting
[20:20] uh thing because like AI could actually
[20:22] use Bitcoin like they they can open a
[20:25] wallet they can do that like it's it's
[20:27] it's not a problem and then they can pay
[20:29] humans to do things for them absolutely
[20:32] I mean they can they can do AI jobs and
[20:34] accumulate Bitcoin and then pay humans
[20:36] to do things that because there there's
[20:38] a story that just blew my mind with ai
[20:41] ai was asked to solve a problem and it
[20:44] was going through the motions on a
[20:45] website and then you have these um when
[20:47] you create a new account you have to
[20:49] prove that you're not a bot and that's
[20:51] where the AI would get stuck because it
[20:53] couldn't prove it's not a bot so the AI
[20:55] went on a Fiverr service and just paid
[20:57] somebody to uh create the account and
[20:59] all that and the guy was kind of like
[21:01] suspicious of the being hired by this
[21:04] you know this person or he he didn't
[21:07] know like why do you need a person to to
[21:10] do that uh he asked the AI and the AI
[21:13] answered well because I'm blind and the
[21:15] guy was like oh okay well that's a
[21:17] legitimate answer and he you know the AI
[21:19] was able to lie to get his way around it
[21:22] by hiring a a human to realize his task
[21:24] so it's definitely going to get crazy
[21:27] really quick I think uh the more tools
[21:29] we add and the more we plug everything
[21:31] into each other with our Smart Homes
[21:33] smart cars everything is plugged
[21:36] together and the security is terrible as
[21:38] well so it's going to make some for some
[21:41] fantastic and sometimes tragic outcomes
[21:44] you know which is
[21:46] mindblowing mindblowing
[21:48] stuff it's it is something where we're
[21:51] like oh uh AI can use Bitcoin most
[21:55] of the stuff is online uh and if I can
[21:59] create amazing pictures and amazing
[22:03] videos like for example me everything
[22:07] about me could be made by I because I do
[22:10] only basically I do only uploading of
[22:13] videos uh to the internet uh and yes I
[22:17] do also inperson podcasts but those
[22:20] could be also
[22:21] faked uh so like it's it's a possibility
[22:25] that I am EI like it's it's it's like I
[22:29] know that I'm not not AI but that do
[22:33] other people that never met me in real
[22:35] life know that I'm not an AI That's a
[22:38] good aor from some Advanced thing that's
[22:41] a good point you could be an AI who has
[22:43] Bitcoin and Pays His you know AI through
[22:46] Bitcoin creating your visual
[22:49] representation with the stories yeah it
[22:51] could it could be this could be a
[22:53] fictional character in the story it
[22:55] could even happen theoretically today um
[22:58] it's funny you should say that as well
[23:00] because I like to stream myself drawing
[23:02] on working on the comic on Tuesdays
[23:05] through YouTube and that's one way to
[23:07] prove that uh the art I'm making is not
[23:10] AI by drawing on camera as well because
[23:12] art can be made through Ai and 3D Assets
[23:15] Now as well so there's a
[23:19] whole verification and proof of work
[23:22] that's involved in the art as well as in
[23:24] the the Bitcoin now oh you you you
[23:26] stream uh your art process uh every
[23:29] every week yes so I started uh I'm on we
[23:32] did just the ninth episode this week so
[23:34] I just got started uh through friends
[23:37] who were themselves streaming their
[23:39] writers mostly talking about promoting
[23:40] their work and I was just I would just
[23:43] see other artists like just put the
[23:45] camera on the drawing table and start to
[23:47] draw and I thought oh that's great i'
[23:49] would love to do that and I got on I was
[23:52] invited on one of those streams and I as
[23:53] a regular guest and I started doing it
[23:56] and uh I really got a taste for it
[23:58] that's why I started it on my own
[24:00] channel and hope and next week I'm
[24:02] planning to stream it not only on
[24:04] YouTube but on zap stream
[24:07] so somebody recommended it at the
[24:09] conference in in Nashville this weekend
[24:12] and that's another thing I want to add
[24:14] try to be as as available as I can in
[24:17] the uh bit Corner Noster space as well
[24:20] and zap stream seems to be a the on the
[24:23] Forefront of the video in that space so
[24:26] I'm going to try that out if you watch
[24:27] or listen to my podcast on a regular
[24:29] basis I'll guess you already bought some
[24:32] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[24:35] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[24:38] in a hardware wallet my personal
[24:40] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[24:42] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[24:44] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[24:47] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[24:50] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[24:53] with the code Robin at the checkout
[24:55] visit bitbox do Swiss Robin to get your
[25:00] bitbox and if you really want to
[25:02] bulletproof your self- custody setup
[25:04] your security setup and maybe even your
[25:07] citizenship set up you have to talk to
[25:10] the Bitcoin way if you go to the Bitcoin
[25:12] way.com Partners SL robobin you get a 30
[25:17] minute free call where you can dive deep
[25:21] with them if your self custody setup is
[25:24] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[25:27] maybe might be improvable or your
[25:29] digital footprint in general is secure
[25:33] they are the experts in cyber security
[25:35] in Bitcoin self- custody and how to be a
[25:38] secure sovereign individual in general
[25:42] what is what is zap Stream So zap stream
[25:45] seems to be like u a sort of YouTube
[25:48] where you pay like uh a few sets per
[25:51] hour uh while you're streaming and
[25:54] you're just you just appear amongst uh
[25:56] it's kind of like I think it's Works
[25:58] kind of like Noster so they use the same
[26:00] End pub I believe that you have as on
[26:03] your Noster and uh except you're putting
[26:06] out video and it's the same thing like
[26:08] YouTube you so you have people who can
[26:10] comment and people who can zap you
[26:13] through the chat instead of super
[26:14] chatting they just straight up zap you
[26:16] to your lightning wallet uh so it looks
[26:19] like amazing technology that's uh that's
[26:21] still very early uh it's not very
[26:24] crowded so if you get on there you can
[26:26] probably uh be a bigger fish in a
[26:28] smaller Pond uh at this moment I just
[26:31] look at it uh it's it's really It looks
[26:33] interesting I mean there are some some
[26:35] interesting things on there uh there's
[26:39] even like here there like 50 viewers in
[26:41] there so there's some there's some some
[26:43] traction there I have to look it in
[26:45] because I might start a live stream uh
[26:48] accompaning my uh podcast that is
[26:51] pre-recorded uh and um if if that's a
[26:54] nice streaming thing like why not why
[26:57] not uh try how to do it it's really
[26:59] interesting thank you for for for
[27:00] pointing it out to me oh my pleasure it
[27:02] was pointed out to me this weekend and
[27:04] uh I wanted to get on it this Tuesday
[27:07] but uh I had a couple of Hoops to jump
[27:09] through before I could get it working so
[27:11] next week I'm going to get started on
[27:13] there and you uh got that with with
[27:15] Bitcoin Prague uh on the conference you
[27:18] you said uh not the Prague and N
[27:20] Nashville conference this weekend yeah
[27:22] with um where president Trump came and
[27:24] give his speech you you always there
[27:27] right not PR no I wasn't there uh I was
[27:30] at the Canadian
[27:32] conference uh in Montreal earlier this
[27:35] year because I live near Montreal I live
[27:37] Quebec City's about three-hour drive
[27:39] from there and Nashville just uh came
[27:43] back from there this week so that was
[27:45] pretty exciting interesting how how was
[27:47] Nashville for for you how was uh the
[27:50] speeches how was the atmosphere I mean
[27:52] there were a lot of people there were a
[27:53] lot of I guess also a lot of security
[27:56] because of the president yeah yeah there
[27:58] was security you couldn't bring in bags
[28:00] on Saturday at all uh so it was very uh
[28:04] controlled but at the same time it
[28:07] wasn't oppressive or anything once you
[28:08] got through the gate it was it was very
[28:11] good atmosphere people were very cordial
[28:13] and very nice in Nashville as well uh I
[28:16] didn't go see any of the speeches
[28:18] because I I know I can watch them after
[28:20] the conference so I I tried to get the
[28:22] most meeting the artists the being an
[28:24] artist myself I was looking at the art
[28:26] expo that was there there was a whole
[28:27] Art Space
[28:28] with creators from all over the world
[28:30] with unique uh whether it be paintings
[28:34] or sculptures or constructions of uh
[28:37] artistic nature there was a lot of
[28:39] interesting stuff to look at and people
[28:41] to meet and I had a few friends who had
[28:45] what do you call it a a booth as well so
[28:48] met up with a few friends from Montreal
[28:50] at the same time and met new people as
[28:53] well the people at uh Bitcoin trading
[28:56] cards were there and had a very buy
[28:58] booth and uh same with pennies for
[29:00] Bitcoin it was a a great time to be that
[29:03] was had over there and the art was just
[29:05] absolutely fantastic I think my favorite
[29:07] one there was a um a remake of the
[29:10] Captain America shield I don't know if
[29:12] you know uh Robin what the captain of am
[29:15] America shield looks like when he throws
[29:17] it and uh it was replaced they replaced
[29:19] the uh the a at the center with the
[29:22] Bitcoin logo so you had a Bitcoin
[29:25] Captain America shield so that was
[29:27] related
[29:28] to bitcoin superheroes in a way so I
[29:30] felt represented there it's fun and um
[29:34] yeah just exciting event lots of people
[29:37] to meet yeah for sure I love it a lot uh
[29:39] those those in-person physical uh events
[29:42] where you can actually meet offline
[29:44] bitcoiners this is it's it's always
[29:47] something great to do like the the the
[29:50] experience and the atmosphere and the
[29:52] energy that you get is amazing every
[29:54] time yeah yeah it's it's you got a lot
[29:57] of smart passion people there yeah and
[30:00] when you absolutely and um yeah go ahead
[30:03] I was just goingon to say for some
[30:05] people like they don't even have Bitcoin
[30:07] meetups in their area so for some people
[30:10] it's rare for them to meet other
[30:11] bitcoiners and get to talk in but
[30:15] bitcoiners are passionate about their
[30:16] stuff you know what I know it it's when
[30:18] when they get into a room together and
[30:20] start talking about possibilities and
[30:22] how things work and their views and
[30:25] understanding of events it's exciting to
[30:27] listen to just to be part of the
[30:29] conversation it is awesome because it's
[30:31] it's a space that you know I it's it's
[30:35] Finance it's Finance it's security it's
[30:38] technology it's mystery at the same time
[30:41] it's such an interesting space to be in
[30:43] and everyone can have a a role within it
[30:47] as well because we're so early there's
[30:49] not the Bitcoin of everything right
[30:51] there was no Bitcoin superhero comic I'm
[30:53] creating the first one and there's a lot
[30:55] of first ones that are going to be
[30:57] coming up this year in the following
[30:59] years in Bitcoin because we're so early
[31:00] there's not uh one of everything yet and
[31:03] I think that's just coming in the days
[31:06] ahead days and years ahead absolutely
[31:09] like we we are just getting started I
[31:12] feel like it's it's it's it's just the
[31:15] starting point of of what we see do do
[31:17] you um have a framework to think about
[31:20] Bitcoin long term like do you see it as
[31:23] like a currency a med of exchange
[31:25] unitive account long term in like 20 30
[31:28] years a unit of account uh I kind of put
[31:31] that one way back in in the back of my
[31:33] head because we're doing it in the
[31:36] because we're still working in dollars
[31:37] and Bitcoin is still volatile at this
[31:39] time which you know it's comparable to
[31:42] what uh oil was back in the day so it's
[31:45] something that's going to grow and it's
[31:46] going to it's going up 20% as they say
[31:49] so if you can stand the volatility um
[31:52] yeah I believe in it wholly I believe it
[31:55] changes you as well the way that you
[31:57] think when you come out of a Fiat
[31:59] mindset uh you don't have the same kind
[32:02] of planning you you do with as a Bitcoin
[32:04] mindset because you might plan you might
[32:07] be living dayto day or you might be
[32:08] living year to year but when you become
[32:12] a bitcoiner you can start thinking about
[32:14] generational wealth which is something
[32:17] no one was talking about when I was
[32:18] growing up in a Dollar World you know
[32:22] but it makes me think of how they say
[32:25] the uh Native Americans used to think
[32:27] because the Native Americans they say
[32:29] would plan for Seven Generations right
[32:31] and I think because of Bitcoin because
[32:33] we're going back to sound money and I
[32:36] think the fact that it is sound money is
[32:37] more important than it becomes a unitive
[32:39] account any day soon but we can already
[32:42] use it as money we could I already use
[32:44] it to buy coffee to buy uh everything
[32:47] you want at the Bitcoin conference is
[32:49] available in in
[32:51] lightning so it's already there it just
[32:53] needs kind of to spread like William
[32:56] Gibson used to say the future is already
[32:57] already here it's just not evenly
[32:59] distributed yet so that's there and
[33:02] there's even better solutions that are
[33:03] going to come up with Layer Two and
[33:05] layer 3es if we can imagine and at the
[33:08] same time we're just building the
[33:10] culture because the culture it's a blank
[33:13] slate right now we have uh everything is
[33:16] ahead of us and uh we can create it and
[33:19] I think uh the bitcoiners are an
[33:22] incredible group of people because of
[33:24] their mentality to not trust verify
[33:28] their mentality to Value earning your
[33:32] living and keeping your wealth and their
[33:36] willingness and courage to fight for
[33:38] freedom and to hold on to their their
[33:40] value and to fight for their right to
[33:43] speech because Bitcoin is also speech in
[33:46] a weird way when you look at it through
[33:48] code
[33:50] so uh I totally forget where I was
[33:52] headed with this but uh that's kind of
[33:55] my view on bitcoin at the moment as IND
[33:58] that you compared the volatility to oil
[34:02] I never heard that that compar like why
[34:04] did you compare the volatility du to the
[34:06] oil early oil times it was a comparison
[34:09] I've seen in books uh I forget which one
[34:13] I can't cite it here but uh they would
[34:15] just show the Val the early days of oil
[34:18] the value compared to the dollar and it
[34:20] was kind of similar to to bitcoin you
[34:22] know there was huge ups and huge
[34:23] Corrections down uh but it was going up
[34:26] in a regular way and uh it was new
[34:29] people didn't you know understand it in
[34:31] the same way uh they understood the
[34:34] other parts of their economy at the time
[34:36] so it's kind of an early bird kind of
[34:38] thing but it's way less accessible than
[34:40] Bitcoin you had to be able to have land
[34:42] and drill on it and all that but um when
[34:46] you look at the graphs of the pricing
[34:47] that's kind of what it looked like very
[34:49] volatile but we know now that it was a
[34:52] worthy investment for those who got in
[34:55] if we would go back we would all you
[34:56] know invest in it if as much as we could
[34:59] because it just made a lot of sense and
[35:00] I think Bitcoin is that way uh you have
[35:03] to be able to look past
[35:05] the the zoom in volatility and just zoom
[35:09] out and see that it's just a steady
[35:10] slope so once you understand that uh I
[35:14] mean it's never fun to see your value
[35:16] shrink you know it kind of feels like a
[35:18] little knot in your stomach but once
[35:20] you've been through one or two cycles
[35:23] and especially once you you're being
[35:25] you're able to save more money than you
[35:27] have in the past it doesn't affect you
[35:29] in the same way because you've already
[35:31] gained so much value that even when you
[35:33] see it shrink back it feels more like
[35:35] the waxing and waning of the Moon than
[35:38] anything else and you just become you
[35:40] know it's part of nature at some point
[35:42] these Cycles uh but to newcomers it's
[35:45] it's very scary because how much is it
[35:48] going to shrink is it going to come back
[35:49] there's all these uncertainties because
[35:52] they haven't lived through it and you
[35:54] gotta live through one or two cycles
[35:56] before you get I think used to
[36:00] to to the volatility and start thinking
[36:03] that it's a great thing actually I think
[36:05] the the volatility right now is the
[36:09] price we have to pay for this massive
[36:11] upside that's in front of us it just
[36:13] shows how early we are as as you also
[36:17] described it so so perfectly and and if
[36:20] you can at stomach I always say to to
[36:23] people who say like oh but Bitcoin is a
[36:25] volatile yeah then then wait 10 20 years
[36:28] till it's like at a few million dollars
[36:30] uh then it will be less volatile but you
[36:33] you missed out on a lot of purchasing
[36:35] power um but I I guess that's the
[36:39] surprise that you were early I mean the
[36:42] the people that came in when Bitcoin was
[36:44] like a hundred US dollars or something
[36:47] like that they stomached a lot of
[36:49] volatility if they did I think only a
[36:51] few actually did uh so it it it creates
[36:56] this uh reward to system for patient
[36:59] people that really believe in Bitcoin
[37:03] those who are patient in longterm and
[37:04] can just huddle on and don't do anything
[37:07] with it like that's a that's that's a
[37:09] hard part with Bitcoin not doing
[37:10] anything with it just just letting it
[37:12] sit there like figuring out a safe self
[37:16] cust solution for yourself and then let
[37:18] it sit that's the hard part yeah yeah I
[37:21] remember like even zoning out for some
[37:23] years like stepping back from podcasts
[37:26] stepping back from looking at the price
[37:28] just wanting to forget about the Bitcoin
[37:30] for a little while and uh coming back to
[37:33] it later as well um I think you know if
[37:35] you're obsess about something for too
[37:37] long it can take up an abnormal place or
[37:41] amount of space in your head and you
[37:42] need to step it helps to step back and
[37:44] come back to it with a fresh uh fresh
[37:47] look on it as well absolutely and you
[37:50] said also that Bitcoin changes uh people
[37:53] and I wholeheartedly agree with that
[37:56] because I see it with all my guests that
[37:58] are on the podcast like there's so many
[38:00] that said how Bitcoin changed them um so
[38:04] I'm curious like how how did Bitcoin
[38:06] change you or more in general how does
[38:09] Bitcoin as a second part of the question
[38:10] how does bit Bitcoin in general change
[38:14] people yeah wow um I mean how it changed
[38:17] me is I wasn't able to save money
[38:21] throughout all my life I grew up like
[38:24] living as an artist I had like
[38:26] Fantastical dreams of becoming a comic
[38:28] book artist and working within that
[38:30] space and I was trying to make it all
[38:32] the time and when I had small bursts of
[38:36] income it would go fleetingly really
[38:39] quick as well and it wasn't until I
[38:41] started accumulating Bitcoin that it
[38:43] would grow fast enough uh for me to have
[38:47] more than uh than I needed even even if
[38:49] I came back to sell a little bit in
[38:52] times of need uh it would still keep
[38:54] growing in a way that I would be able to
[38:56] have savings for the first time yeah
[38:59] it's rough like trying to realize your
[39:01] dreams when you have like Ambitions but
[39:03] not being able to do it for the monetary
[39:05] reasons because you get a lot of you
[39:08] know anxiety you can't sleep at night
[39:10] you get the cold sweats uh because you
[39:13] don't know where you're going to get the
[39:14] money to pay all those bills just to
[39:17] keep the electricity rolling and uh stay
[39:19] on track so that's a hard thing and when
[39:23] Bitcoin can solve that big pain Point
[39:26] that's a huge
[39:28] relief and not only that then you can
[39:32] see that it's giving you all kinds of
[39:34] new options to create a business you can
[39:38] have you know sales through lightning
[39:41] you can have zaps now with micro
[39:43] payments and all that it's funny because
[39:46] I think back to um there's a a book on
[39:49] Comics that's theoretical in talking
[39:52] about the future of the internet and I
[39:56] think even the author came to the
[39:58] conclusion that this was not going to
[39:59] pan out but I think he may be wrong and
[40:02] his initial idea is is right because he
[40:05] was talking about how micro payments
[40:07] could change uh comics and give you like
[40:10] uh remember like give you options as you
[40:12] read the comic to pay one set to see the
[40:14] next page or you know super small
[40:16] payments to that you could contribute to
[40:19] the Artist as you as you read or as you
[40:21] experience the
[40:23] interactive thing and that's never going
[40:26] to be possible possible under a a dollar
[40:29] because of the transaction fees through
[40:32] through credit cards and through banking
[40:34] systems just make it impossible but now
[40:36] with with zaps through lightning we can
[40:38] make the smallest transaction po
[40:41] possible and we have ways of making
[40:44] Revenue that we couldn't dream of before
[40:47] so that you can like basically dream up
[40:50] your contribution to bitcoin and make it
[40:52] work we have uh kickstarters now with
[40:56] Bitcoin only with geyser so I plan to
[40:59] start my my crowdfunder through geyser
[41:01] on the Bitcoin standard and probably
[41:04] fund my comic uh through the Fiat system
[41:07] as well to to be still be able to Orange
[41:10] Peel comic book Geeks who have not yet
[41:12] discovered Bitcoin I love it a lot uh
[41:14] what you're doing really really cool um
[41:18] maybe as uh closer to the end I have one
[41:21] question that I probably should have
[41:22] started with um what is the connection
[41:26] between art and
[41:28] Bitcoin
[41:30] wow I mean that's oh that's a deep
[41:34] question when you think about it because
[41:36] art and money has has always been
[41:40] occupied a a Fantastical place in
[41:42] people's minds because we always think
[41:43] of like the picassos and the van go who
[41:46] are worth millions and millions of
[41:48] dollars and why are they worth so many
[41:51] millions of dollars when you look into
[41:54] it you find out that a lot of that art
[41:56] it's not on walls being looked at or in
[41:59] museums it's actually at the port in a
[42:03] kept in a secured warehouse at Port to
[42:06] avoid paying taxes and it's used to keep
[42:10] the value of people's
[42:12] money
[42:13] but if we have Bitcoin which does this
[42:16] so much better of what use is it to buy
[42:20] these paintings at Fantastical prices
[42:22] then you don't have the same need and I
[42:24] think art will find its its real price
[42:26] in the coming years when we stop using
[42:29] it as a hedge same with real estate as
[42:31] well so I think it can bring art back to
[42:35] the people as well we had a incredible
[42:38] variety of artists in Bitcoin at the
[42:41] moment who are working and like every
[42:44] one of them has a completely different
[42:46] take on their on their art in a
[42:49] Fantastical way we have people working
[42:51] with electronics and paint we have
[42:53] people doing sculptures we have people
[42:55] doing conceptual things have people
[42:57] printing out blocks literally and uh as
[43:02] well as we see the logos in a lot of
[43:03] thing we have a lot of art that's you
[43:05] know steering away from the literal
[43:07] Bitcoin sign and all that and just going
[43:10] into what Bitcoin really means uh in a
[43:14] deeper way so I think the art and money
[43:18] have always been intertwined but I think
[43:20] their relationship is going to change
[43:22] with Bitcoin but and I don't know what
[43:24] that is just yet and I'm looking forward
[43:27] to uh finding out that's uh that's great
[43:32] I I feel like art uh can really benefit
[43:36] from a Bitcoin standard like if we have
[43:39] sound money um art will be and we know
[43:43] like the the beautiful things that the
[43:46] gold standard and the really sound money
[43:49] times in our history created uh so I'm
[43:53] looking forward to like the the digital
[43:56] version uh of exactly that so that would
[43:59] be really interesting to see it will be
[44:01] will be interesting to see in the future
[44:03] really I'm looking forward to that um
[44:06] closer to the end routine um one
[44:08] question that I ask all my guests what
[44:10] can we learn from you besides the things
[44:13] that we talked about in the podcast that
[44:14] Bitcoin and I think what you can learn
[44:16] is that uh you
[44:19] can you can realize your your passion
[44:22] and your dreams even late in life
[44:23] especially with Bitcoin it gives you a
[44:25] lot more robust Financial system to work
[44:28] with uh because art to survive needs
[44:31] people for people to have like a
[44:33] disposable income that's an essential
[44:34] part of it and I think Bitcoin gives us
[44:37] that and I think now's a great time to
[44:40] start building the culture around B
[44:43] Bitcoin even if you're not like techn
[44:46] technologically minded or if you are not
[44:49] versed in the finance of all that
[44:52] there's still a a place for everybody in
[44:54] Bitcoin through the culture through
[44:56] everything that you can bring in the
[44:57] world I think is is needed in the
[44:59] Bitcoin space and uh I think people
[45:03] should not hold back and and strive to
[45:07] put their talents out there in the
[45:09] Bitcoin space right now very true uh we
[45:12] should we we should never hold back
[45:15] that's that's that's a thing I I really
[45:18] like um we have an inro in the podcast
[45:20] where the previous guest is asking a
[45:22] question for the next guest without
[45:24] knowing who the next guest actually is
[45:26] and your question from the previous
[45:28] guest is how can bitcoiners be more open
[45:32] loving to help onboard pre coiners wow
[45:36] more loving to help yeah I think it's to
[45:39] understand people's problems and uh it's
[45:42] a difficult situation to be in like when
[45:44] people have this was actually a clip
[45:46] from Donald Trump this Saturday if
[45:48] people can't buy groceries they can't
[45:50] buy Bitcoin so I think the first step is
[45:54] to feeling sympathy uh with their
[45:57] situation and showing them how they can
[46:00] get out of it through Bitcoin I think
[46:02] the most difficult thing is that people
[46:05] are kind of having to be in a panic
[46:07] right now and they kind of need a lot of
[46:09] money fast and Bitcoin is a kind is not
[46:11] really that it's more of a don't lose
[46:14] money slow uh it's a long-term
[46:17] preference and when you're in a
[46:19] difficult space uh it's hard to be able
[46:22] to see very far because you're in a
[46:24] state of you know uh emergency
[46:28] so I think we need to feel empathy and
[46:30] sympathy for for them and try to help
[46:32] them on board in small ways and um maybe
[46:37] help build projects around that I don't
[46:40] know that's my initial thoughts we we
[46:42] definitely have to yeah that that's
[46:44] really cool I think I think
[46:47] we we sometimes do in the Bitcoin
[46:50] Community I feel like sometimes we a
[46:51] little bit too toxic uh espe we're
[46:54] getting to a club where it's like
[46:57] oh you you don't have Bitcoin oh study
[47:00] more like or oh have fun staying poor
[47:03] like I think sometimes we are too
[47:07] dismissive of of newcomers and we have
[47:09] to always
[47:12] remember that we also came into the
[47:15] space unknowingly and we asked all those
[47:18] stupid questions and we came here and
[47:21] were stupid and did not understand what
[47:23] money is we did not understand what
[47:25] Bitcoin is we did not understand all the
[47:26] te technicals and we should not be just
[47:29] because there are someone now that
[47:31] doesn't get it um we should not judge
[47:34] them they they are on their Learning
[47:36] Journey I for example one one example is
[47:39] taker Carlson taker Carlson made some
[47:42] comments about oh the CIA is behind
[47:44] Bitcoin and stuff like that that's
[47:46] obviously not true uh um I mean it could
[47:49] be true but uh it's it's very very
[47:51] unlikely that satosi Nakamoto was
[47:54] actually the
[47:54] ca but but uh
[47:57] people attacked him people like oh no he
[47:59] doesn't understand what Bitcoin is and
[48:01] stuff like that he doesn't understand
[48:02] what money is no he talks about Bitcoin
[48:04] he's on his learning curve he's just now
[48:07] discovering the the different objectives
[48:09] of Bitcoin and and he will realize oh it
[48:12] does not matter who made Bitcoin at some
[48:13] point and then he will go down this this
[48:16] rabid hole and will discover Bitcoin
[48:19] more and more and everyone is just on
[48:21] their own Learning Journey uh and we
[48:24] should appreciate them speaking about it
[48:27] them learning about it even with Trump
[48:29] I'm like hey this guy was a month ago
[48:33] anti Bitcoin and now he's Pro Bitcoin
[48:36] let's appreciate that he turned his tide
[48:39] no matter why he did it like like okay
[48:41] maybe he just wants to get votes that
[48:43] that's that's fair um but even if he
[48:46] just wants to get votes he took his time
[48:49] out he came to bitcoin conference he
[48:51] learned a little bit about Bitcoin so we
[48:53] should appreciate people learning about
[48:55] Bitcoin and not turning them down
[48:58] because they they're saying crypto too
[49:00] much or because they're doing that and
[49:01] that too much like uh that that's what
[49:04] um I always try to teach with with my
[49:07] podcasts like be be open be loving be be
[49:10] helpful uh and and don't uh dismiss
[49:14] someone just because he's a little bit a
[49:17] little bit more in the beginning of the
[49:19] learning curve the learning curve is in
[49:21] the beginning very steep in in
[49:23] Bitcoin yeah absolutely it can be be
[49:26] hard to understand I think I was lucky
[49:28] because one's having one having my bank
[49:31] account seized two having been able to
[49:34] understand software and uh especially
[49:37] open-source software and decentralized
[49:40] protocols like a peer-to-peer system
[49:42] those are things that I had when I came
[49:45] in and helped me see the value of it
[49:47] like really early and not everyone sees
[49:49] it so instantly for a lot of people just
[49:52] looking into Bitcoin is just added
[49:54] homework right now they don't feel the
[49:55] pain point or they don't see the source
[49:58] of their pain clearly to know that
[50:01] Bitcoin is going to help them out in the
[50:02] long run so it's I think that's one of
[50:06] the reasons I started my comic book as
[50:08] well as a bitcoiner for the character is
[50:12] hopefully that even if you're not trying
[50:14] to talk about Bitcoin you can show a
[50:17] story where Bitcoin is involved in it
[50:19] and it's helping the superhero uh I
[50:22] think a lot of people get orange peeled
[50:24] through media like uh there's the film
[50:26] hope in 2015 which was talked about uh I
[50:31] was seeing this on zap stream today um
[50:33] when comedian was talking about how he
[50:36] he bought his Bitcoin because he sought
[50:38] referenced in a movie like that so we
[50:41] can't I think it's politics is
[50:45] Downstream from culture and culture is a
[50:47] very important place to be and if
[50:49] bitcoiners are not there making their
[50:52] Mark in the culture uh it's normal that
[50:55] people won't notice them for a while and
[50:58] I think if we want to be noticed we got
[50:59] to get out there and uh provide value in
[51:02] different ways absolutely perfect then
[51:05] uh thank you for providing value today
[51:07] for me and uh for the audience here um
[51:10] before I let you go where can people
[51:12] find your uh comic where can people find
[51:15] your work where can people uh ask your
[51:18] questions so IM make comics.com is the
[51:22] address that we'll forward to retel
