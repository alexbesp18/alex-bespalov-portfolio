[00:00] Banks actually don't want your money
[00:02] unless they know where it's coming from
[00:04] some amount of money hit our account and
[00:06] we got completely unbanked was a small
[00:08] amount private accounts business
[00:10] accounts savings accounts checkings
[00:12] accounts two Banks completely ejected
[00:15] from the system up until this day it's
[00:17] now 3 months in no communication you
[00:19] can't pay for groceries you can't pay
[00:21] your bills everything's blocked you have
[00:23] to activate friends and family to
[00:26] provide for you I'm All Out viat Allin
[00:29] Bitcoin that's one thing that hits you
[00:32] so hard the control that they have over
[00:34] you you're thirsty you can't stop by
[00:37] side of the road to grab a drink at the
[00:39] gas station cuz your cards are not
[00:40] working we'll survive but I think first
[00:43] it's going to get harder uh before it
[00:45] gets easier Bitcoin will keep going up
[00:48] you'll have to keep improving your
[00:50] security with great power comes great
[00:52] responsibility that's what Bitcoin is
[00:55] giving us freedom and responsibility we
[00:59] never in history had the amount of
[01:01] Freedom that we can have on a Bitcoin
[01:05] [Music]
[01:09] standard you had a bad experience with
[01:12] with a fear bank that kind of threw you
[01:15] out from what I was understanding how
[01:17] was
[01:18] that yeah so the the the background the
[01:22] background there is
[01:26] Baga is accepting Bitcoin as payment for
[01:32] hardware and
[01:34] services the suppliers they don't accept
[01:37] Bitcoin yet right they they still need
[01:39] to be orange built and I'm working on
[01:42] that but until that day uh we have to
[01:46] pay them with Fiat and I have to sell
[01:48] Bitcoin in order to pay them and when
[01:52] selling Bitcoin peer-to-peer
[01:55] to um have a little premium on top of
[02:00] and not lose even more margins by the
[02:04] kyc exchanges because if you sell
[02:05] through the big exchanges like a good
[02:09] citizen would they they gnaw off fees
[02:14] and that's just hurting business so
[02:17] that's why we choose to go to
[02:19] peer-to-peer
[02:20] and Banks don't like that because then
[02:23] you can receive money that they don't
[02:26] know where it's coming from and Banks
[02:28] actually don't want your money
[02:31] unless they know where it's coming
[02:33] from and with all the new regulations
[02:36] hitting that's becoming more and more
[02:38] clear especially in EU I mean it's it's
[02:40] it's monstrous right now the EU travel
[02:42] Rule and what else has been activated M
[02:44] now in 2025 it's ridiculous and and so
[02:47] they're really scared and that's I guess
[02:49] the the backstory there that
[02:52] um some amount of money hit our account
[02:56] and we got completely
[02:58] unbanked it was a small from just small
[03:01] amount but but if you have uh
[03:03] peer-to-peer selling you got from an
[03:06] individual money right because the
[03:09] individual sell he got Bitcoin and he
[03:11] got how
[03:12] did how like I also sometimes get money
[03:17] from like a new account that I never got
[03:20] money from like what what how did they
[03:24] know like what was them bothering with
[03:27] that transaction was it that big was it
[03:29] usual big or something like that
[03:32] definitely not so here's the thing um I
[03:35] have no idea what triggered it they have
[03:39] zero communication zero communication as
[03:42] to why they did what they did this is an
[03:46] assumption of
[03:48] me and one specific phone call to
[03:51] customer support by One Bank mentioned
[03:53] it was a 600 EUR
[03:56] transaction a 600 transaction peerto
[04:00] peer so are you kidding me one of many
[04:03] just that was the way things were done
[04:06] and suddenly perhaps some dirty money by
[04:09] some individual who was linked to I
[04:12] don't know drugs child born whatever
[04:14] they don't like um or really that's I
[04:17] mean that's that's can be qualified as
[04:19] as dirty money right um and that's what
[04:22] I'm assuming that that dirty money hit
[04:26] our account
[04:27] and private account business accounts
[04:32] savings accounts checkings accounts two
[04:34] Banks completely ejected from the system
[04:37] no prior message no warning no nothing
[04:39] not blocking the trans not not just
[04:41] blocking the transaction completely
[04:43] unbanking locked all my money away One
[04:46] Bank KBC up until this day um that's now
[04:50] three months in completely unbanked my
[04:52] money is locked no communication an
[04:55] investigation is ongoing that's it and I
[04:57] just keep bothering them but but nothing
[04:59] moves
[05:01] wild it's wild two two different banks
[05:04] uh the that got you kicked out two
[05:06] different banks at the same time it was
[05:08] coordinated 100% yeah and that's that's
[05:11] the whole thing because people say like
[05:13] oh like you just got kicked out of One
[05:14] bank it's like no like the the Fiat
[05:16] system is one thing and it's it's one
[05:19] big Bank all of the they have different
[05:20] logos they have different management
[05:22] teams but they are way more coordinated
[05:25] as as we think they have the same
[05:26] Blacklist they have the same uh things
[05:29] going on so like you kind of got kicked
[05:31] out of the whole fear system what did
[05:33] you do did you open a new bank account
[05:35] with someone else or like did you move
[05:38] open new bank accounts uh indeed well
[05:42] well first I have to say it's you can
[05:46] describe it and talk about it
[05:49] but until that happens to you you don't
[05:54] really realize what it is because you
[05:56] can't pay for groceries you can't pay
[05:59] your bills
[06:01] everything's blocked you have to
[06:04] activate friends and family
[06:07] to provide for you in your financial
[06:12] requirements because if you have two
[06:14] Banks and these two banks have locked
[06:16] your money down you got no money no Fiat
[06:18] money and of course I'm All Out Fiat
[06:22] Allin Bitcoin but that doesn't pay the
[06:25] bills so so that's that's one thing that
[06:27] you that that that hits you so hard the
[06:30] control that they have over you really
[06:34] is absolute you're thirsty you can't
[06:36] stop by the side of the road to grab a
[06:38] drink at the gas station because your
[06:40] cards is not working Gas Stations don't
[06:42] accept
[06:44] Bitcoin so it it it really is all
[06:46] encompassing and then you open new bank
[06:48] accounts of course there's bank accounts
[06:50] that
[06:51] are friendlier notorious some banks are
[06:55] notoriously wary of these things
[06:59] uh revolute biank I mean there's a lot
[07:02] of digital versions now right um and
[07:06] that has been working and now Baga goes
[07:11] through kyc exchanges to sell Bitcoin as
[07:15] a good citizen does with full
[07:18] identification nothing out of the
[07:21] ordinary
[07:23] but yeah we
[07:25] got smacked down pretty hard there and
[07:28] and and B C pay server self custody it's
[07:32] up and running you can accept Bitcoin
[07:34] but the reality is that a lot of clients
[07:39] and just doing business it's still it's
[07:42] it's hybrid it's Bitcoin and Fiat we
[07:45] can't at least I can't not on the
[07:47] personal level and not on a business
[07:49] level shift to bitcoin completely it's
[07:51] not viable at this stage
[07:55] yet the digital Nomad perhaps you pay
[07:59] your credit card debt at the end of the
[08:01] month by Bitcoin some guys are doing it
[08:04] but as a business it's just not yet
[08:08] viable yeah I mean I also recently
[08:11] looked into this topic actually because
[08:13] I'm running into a whole different set
[08:15] of problems I I get my um my income in
[08:21] Bitcoin is growing and growing growing
[08:23] uh and the income in fear is kind of
[08:25] stable so at some point I'm running into
[08:27] this uh problem of like like having to
[08:31] pay um or sell my Bitcoin or pay
[08:34] something with Bitcoin so I'm a Bitcoin
[08:38] podcaster I will get a new employee he
[08:41] will accept getting paid in Bitcoin
[08:43] which is amazing uh but still this is
[08:45] kind of the same thing like if I send
[08:48] Bitcoin to someone else or sell Bitcoin
[08:51] uh if you want to be a good citizen
[08:52] that's the same thing like you have to
[08:54] pay taxes on that like uh you have to
[08:56] pay capital gains taxes on that um and
[08:59] and uh so I looked at a lot of different
[09:01] options and the thing is like you can
[09:04] you have two options you can sell your
[09:06] Bitcoin uh spend your Bitcoin whatever
[09:10] uh or you can borrow against your
[09:12] Bitcoin both I don't really
[09:15] like because there are capital gain taxs
[09:18] involved and documentation and all the
[09:20] things that you have to do and the other
[09:22] thing is like then I have to to borrow
[09:25] against my Bitcoin I have to care for
[09:26] the credit thing I have to see like okay
[09:28] do can I is my Bitcoin now locked up
[09:31] somewhere do they have to get the
[09:33] Bitcoin how can I keep keep the control
[09:35] of it so so I don't want to have like I
[09:38] I don't want to get
[09:40] $20,000 uh but lose a whole Bitcoin for
[09:43] that like there's a lot of um verus
[09:46] around around that topic all like how do
[09:49] you go about that if if you have now
[09:51] with bitsy you accept Bitcoin payments
[09:54] um you just go through a kvc exchange
[09:56] you sell it and and and that's how you
[09:58] do it is is is that kind of the the best
[10:00] way to do it that's the flow currently
[10:02] indeed um borrowing against your Bitcoin
[10:06] previous experiences and and then I'm
[10:08] talking about the market as a whole here
[10:11] um winking to
[10:14] platforms like blockfi and
[10:18] others has gotten should have gotten
[10:21] most people wary of these things right
[10:24] um because you're giving up your keys um
[10:27] there are solutions out there with with
[10:30] um discrete law contracts dlc's on chain
[10:33] to maintain custody and borrow against
[10:35] it but these Solutions as far as I
[10:38] understand
[10:40] aren't ready yet for Mass use if you're
[10:44] like pioneer you want to try out I mean
[10:47] they may they might not call it better
[10:48] software you want to you want to try out
[10:50] better software sure but as a viable way
[10:54] of living at least for me or as a
[10:57] business borrowing perhaps down the road
[11:00] I I do like the principle of it of not
[11:02] having to sell it and
[11:06] that's how high net worths often do it
[11:11] you um
[11:13] collateralize assets and then you borrow
[11:16] against it so the principle is really
[11:19] strong there that you can maintain that
[11:20] what is most valuable to you whether
[11:23] that being your company stock or your
[11:26] Bitcoin but I'm afraid
[11:29] I mean there's a lot of there's there's
[11:30] great Solutions out there but today um
[11:34] it needs a lot of ironing out to make it
[11:36] real smooth user experience I'm such a
[11:39] user experience fetishist if it doesn't
[11:41] if it doesn't have one button that
[11:43] solves the problem I'm here to solve and
[11:46] I already I mean yeah we we we have a
[11:49] lot of backend devs in Bitcoin it seems
[11:52] and and ux is really an area to improve
[11:55] I feel both on the hardware and the
[11:57] software
[11:59] uh layer I feel um so yeah that's how we
[12:02] do it right now we sell we have to
[12:05] because it's it's
[12:06] just clients
[12:09] paying uh in Bitcoin and suppliers if
[12:12] it's for harder right the the main
[12:15] branch of the business now is also
[12:16] consultancy helping people with their
[12:18] Bitcoin
[12:19] security and that doesn't always have to
[12:23] be sold but yeah like you said there's
[12:26] two ways here and for now now the
[12:29] smoothest seems to be with pain in the
[12:33] heart to
[12:34] sell but you uh you also have couple
[12:37] gains stxs probably on on those Bitcoin
[12:40] that you have to pay that depends on how
[12:43] your business is
[12:45] structured it it it still depends but
[12:48] there might be because in Belgium it's a
[12:50] little bit of a oneoff kit there but
[12:52] there's regulations of course knocking
[12:55] on the door that is going to change that
[12:58] so
[13:00] for now not
[13:02] always um and that's that's various
[13:05] fiscal tax legislation mumbo jumbo stuff
[13:10] um but that's probably coming
[13:13] interesting yeah um one thing you also
[13:16] mentioned which is super interesting is
[13:17] P2P uh platform platforms um you stop
[13:22] using them now um do you think they they
[13:25] they can or will survive in in the EU as
[13:29] like there's a lot of talk of with with
[13:31] all the KC requirements especially in
[13:34] the EU uh I mean there's like uh vexel
[13:38] there's Beach Bitcoin there multiple
[13:41] platforms that do that do you think they
[13:42] they can or will survive this EU thing
[13:45] yes so it's important to maintain the
[13:49] broader scope here right this thing was
[13:53] is built to withstand these things so
[13:59] we might we will surely we are suffering
[14:03] from these horrendous regulations many
[14:08] companies startups he bit Saga has
[14:10] software that cannot be deployed because
[14:12] of
[14:13] regulations um so definitely various
[14:16] peer-to-peer platforms are suffering
[14:19] from adoption because of regulations so
[14:21] in some sense that's already true but
[14:25] they they most certainly will survive
[14:28] you can
[14:29] on on a protocol level if you look at
[14:31] things like bisque uh it's a separate
[14:34] network with liquidity you just you
[14:36] can't bring that down we will
[14:40] suffer immensely and we might in the
[14:43] peer-to-peer might get pushed into a
[14:47] dark criminal
[14:49] corner but in the end and it does seems
[14:52] to be getting worse right your
[14:54] regulations um for now there's also
[14:58] starting to be a push back of EU act EU
[15:02] accelerationism that is and even voices
[15:05] within the EU like Mario dragy Super
[15:07] Mario um calling for simplification
[15:11] deregulation we need to allow for
[15:14] Innovation within our EU to be able to
[15:18] compete with USA and China um so the
[15:23] pendulum perhaps hasn't started swinging
[15:26] back but at least is slowing
[15:27] down and I guess it's a little bit c
[15:30] yeah yeah not going to go there I think
[15:34] we'll survive definitely um but I think
[15:38] first it's going to get
[15:40] harder uh before it gets easier in the
[15:43] EU at
[15:44] least interest interesting for for
[15:47] spending did you also look at uh cards
[15:50] like U what it called bit bit refill
[15:53] cards and stuff like that where you can
[15:55] basically uh tap into your Bitcoin
[15:57] savings and directly spend it when when
[15:59] you have the credit card yeah bit refill
[16:02] is awesome bit refill is awesome once
[16:04] you discover it and there's many shops
[16:09] platforms that you can buy gift cards
[16:11] right gift cards can be a beautiful
[16:15] unlinking
[16:16] of
[16:19] um losing a chain of of
[16:23] of your identity
[16:26] um on biscuits also a payment method and
[16:30] it's a it's a beautiful one that can be
[16:33] truly
[16:35] Anonymous um so that being said um bit
[16:38] refill I think it's way underutilized
[16:41] probably it's a very big platform but if
[16:44] normies or new people into Bitcoin would
[16:48] realize the not just the store value
[16:51] aspect right because the value goes up
[16:53] but also the um medium of exchange
[16:56] aspect to what extent it is very viable
[16:59] today because of platforms like bit
[17:01] refill I mean it's beautiful especially
[17:03] if you use lightning right you just scan
[17:05] a QR code boom you got your code got to
[17:08] wait for nonchain transaction uh yeah
[17:10] the refill is is is awesome it's
[17:13] viable on an individual level right as a
[17:16] business less so still but especially on
[17:20] the individual level it's a it's
[17:22] beautiful
[17:22] platform yeah and they also have a card
[17:25] now with like a credit card where you
[17:27] can pay if I heard I've not tested it
[17:30] I'm just like because I'm I'm thinking
[17:33] of like okay if I have the Bitcoin uh
[17:36] maybe I want to directly spend it when I
[17:39] have it like like having the longest
[17:43] period of time to have Bitcoin is the
[17:46] best case for me if you have it on the
[17:48] normal bank account I have to sell it
[17:50] and then use it on the bank account but
[17:53] if I can keep it in a Bitcoin account
[17:56] and have a card connected to that and
[17:59] while I'm paying maybe I just move it to
[18:01] lightning like maybe that's the solution
[18:03] of like moving like thousand Euros at a
[18:05] time to to lightning setup and then uh I
[18:09] tap it and it directly converts the
[18:11] lightning into uh cache and while
[18:14] tapping you you're paying that that
[18:16] would be maybe a a perfect solution of
[18:20] while we still have that Fiat system uh
[18:22] you have basically a Bitcoin card which
[18:25] there's a lightning wallet in there and
[18:27] you just tap and hey and this is
[18:29] automatic that that would be kind of a
[18:31] cool thing is is that how bit field cut
[18:33] Works do do you know that by the way I
[18:36] don't know if if bit refill card works
[18:39] that way but I do know that the Bringin
[18:43] card uh which is coming out in a couple
[18:47] of days it should um signed up for the
[18:51] first for the beta batch of the first 50
[18:54] cards should have already arrived
[18:56] anxiously waiting for them to actually
[18:58] arrive
[18:59] and how I've understood it is that you
[19:01] can top up by lightning and then use
[19:05] that card to pay with Fiat anywhere so
[19:12] that's getting pretty close to what
[19:13] you're describing and I might be wrong
[19:16] that it might already be that they are
[19:19] going to automatically convert your
[19:21] Bitcoin Holdings into Fiat the moment
[19:24] that
[19:25] you pay uh if it's not already
[19:29] there in the current beta launch it is I
[19:33] would hope probably
[19:34] coming um that's very exciting bring in
[19:38] b r i n gii n
[19:42] is yeah
[19:44] really beautifully bridging no pun
[19:47] intended or actually yeah uh that that
[19:51] that gap between Fiat and Bitcoin and
[19:53] then the C for daily usage that Medium
[19:56] of that Medium of exchange right um that
[19:58] would be beautiful as you uh describe
[20:00] exactly I had him on the podcast
[20:03] yeah yeah and as soon as the card
[20:06] arrives in my hand I'm I'm looking at
[20:08] yeah for now it's virtual divot cards
[20:10] but the the physical one um should
[20:12] actually be arriving anytime soon so I'm
[20:16] I'm very anxious to make a little video
[20:19] demo of um lightning top up paying with
[20:24] Fiat um and then and then go unbank this
[20:29] I love that yeah and that that's what we
[20:33] the the services and I think there are
[20:34] many more I also heard um from ledger to
[20:38] to n26 nice n26 is the the bank I use in
[20:42] my feed world it's it's I think in
[20:44] Austria the best fed Bank you can have
[20:48] but yeah like coming closer to the state
[20:50] where you are unbanked and you can use
[20:52] Bitcoin in a normal way this is then the
[20:57] the best case for me like that that
[20:59] should be the best thing that that could
[21:02] happen to to us of like we have Bitcoin
[21:05] we can use it and we can use Bitcoin and
[21:08] Bitcoin companies also spend our Fe we
[21:11] don't have to go to those feat
[21:13] institutions we can use Bitcoin
[21:14] institutions to use feat in the meantime
[21:17] while we're waiting for for the Bitcoin
[21:19] standard to uh evolve and unfold in
[21:22] front of our eyes yeah definitely
[21:25] definitely the removing friction that is
[21:28] right cuz that's
[21:30] already possible but there's just steps
[21:33] in between and and like you were
[21:35] describing you really want it to be
[21:39] seamless frictionless hold Bitcoin and
[21:41] be able to spend Fiat I think we're
[21:43] really close ran hasn't already done
[21:45] that I think they are very close paying
[21:48] invoices with Bitcoin directly I think
[21:51] strike and bull Bitcoin probably others
[21:56] are already facilitating this so we're
[21:58] in closer very fast it's it's beautiful
[22:01] also even within the EU even given all
[22:04] the horrendous regulations we're getting
[22:07] there to be able to get
[22:10] unbanked and just sa on without too much
[22:15] hassle it's been a huge hassle but
[22:18] probably maybe let's hope in a couple
[22:21] within two or three years getting
[22:23] unbanked won't be as painful anymore and
[22:26] we'll just be more able to put up a
[22:29] middle finger and not comply that's
[22:32] exactly what I'm looking for but yeah um
[22:34] let's uh let's let's uh let's move to
[22:38] topic which is probably even more
[22:40] important than how to spend Bitcoin is
[22:42] how to secure Bitcoin like that's the
[22:44] that's the most important topic I feel
[22:46] like in Bitcoin and it's the most
[22:48] overlooked topic it's it's it's really
[22:50] fascinating how the most important topic
[22:53] is not seemingly the most important like
[22:57] this is so no brainer like if if you
[22:59] have Bitcoin how do I keep them should
[23:02] be the first question and should be
[23:07] studied probably a little bit more than
[23:10] why Bitcoin we talked about like you
[23:12] you're making out the how Bitcoin
[23:14] securing Bitcoin part uh but everyone
[23:17] knows about the why Bitcoin like the
[23:19] Bitcoin standard and like 2,000 other
[23:22] books that basically describe the same
[23:24] thing uh and and you're not trying to
[23:27] write the the Bitcoin pable for how to
[23:30] secure Bitcoin what are the the
[23:32] cornerstones that you're trying to uh
[23:35] describe there so indeed it is a rather
[23:40] overlooked subject but it's also a very
[23:43] sensitive subject a lot of things within
[23:45] Bitcoin are sensitive because
[23:47] maximalists tend to hold strong
[23:50] opinions um but even within Bitcoin
[23:56] there's a lot of tribalism with with
[23:58] relation with regards to
[24:01] security and probably confirmation
[24:05] bias um when you hold your Bitcoin on a
[24:09] hardware wallet and other people are
[24:11] dunking on set hardware
[24:13] wallets
[24:16] you tend to be easily I to to feel
[24:20] attacked also because it's your precious
[24:22] money that is that is on there and that
[24:25] some security remark whether that's iCal
[24:28] or not it it affects your holding so
[24:30] people are very it's a it's a sensitive
[24:35] subject um there's a lot of
[24:38] opinions people valuing other things
[24:41] some people value air gaps some people
[24:46] don't really care if it's over
[24:49] USB um and there's a lot of different
[24:53] profiles and there's a lot of different
[24:55] hardware and software and and there's a
[24:56] good fit for for for everyone right but
[24:59] the beautiful thing is that because
[25:03] Bitcoin cryptography it's based on
[25:05] mathematics and physics and energy there
[25:08] are objective truths simple example 24
[25:11] words are more secure than 12 words 12
[25:15] words are enough in any
[25:19] case I believe that would be my opinion
[25:22] here mathematically objectively speaking
[25:24] 24 words are more secure and and these
[25:28] are the things that can lead us and not
[25:31] get clouded by opinions and people hold
[25:35] holding a significant amount of money in
[25:37] a specific harder wallet or in a
[25:39] specific security scheme B phrase Shamir
[25:43] multisig um because I've been dubbed a
[25:46] multisig maxi and I wear that badge
[25:48] proudly but you
[25:50] can notice people being protective
[25:55] of uh certain ways and and yeah the book
[26:02] um that is being written securing
[26:05] Bitcoin that is indeed uh the angle the
[26:10] how and not just the basics of getting
[26:13] it off and exchange right because we
[26:15] have been hammering on that Mantra I
[26:17] mean antonoplos has for years and we
[26:21] still need to keep hammering on that
[26:23] Mantra but buying a harder wallet
[26:26] getting your Bitcoin off an exchange in
[26:28] self- custody backing it up on paper or
[26:31] steel that's just the first step I mean
[26:34] if it's on an exchange you don't really
[26:36] hold any Bitcoin right it's it's it's a
[26:38] meme but it's very true so getting it
[26:41] onto a harder wallet that's your first
[26:43] step okay what's next because whenever
[26:47] you start it or if you have significant
[26:51] assent then you're starting out with
[26:53] with with six or more digits um where if
[26:56] you're starting out with a small amount
[26:59] I mean the growth rate of Bitcoin the
[27:02] value growth is is very significant here
[27:06] at some point you're going to be
[27:07] uncomfortable with the value you're
[27:09] holding in just a harder
[27:12] wallet and you're going to realize okay
[27:15] I can make a mistake here $5
[27:18] wrench um I'm getting
[27:20] uncomfortable because the value of your
[27:22] Bitcoin is increasing and or um you've
[27:26] started out with a significant amount
[27:29] I talk to investors who start out just
[27:32] start out dip their toes and that's and
[27:35] that's six digits and perhaps
[27:39] a hardware wallet in the classical sense
[27:43] isn't the best fit there and then we're
[27:46] looking at the next steps right pass Ras
[27:50] because you really you want to eliminate
[27:53] your single point of failure one other
[27:55] world you can back up your seed in
[27:57] multiple places but that also Al
[27:58] increases attack vectors every backup is
[28:01] an attack Vector so you maintain your
[28:04] single point of failure so introducing a
[28:08] passphrase now you need two elements and
[28:10] you're protected from a $5 wrench attack
[28:13] if depending on how you implement it a p
[28:16] phrase is another single point of
[28:18] failure if you only have one if you're
[28:20] only keeping it in your brain or you
[28:23] only have one copy so that depends on
[28:26] the implementation and then there's
[28:27] Shamir Secret sharing splitting up the
[28:30] seed in different parts that you need
[28:32] two any two of three parts and then of
[28:35] course you quickly look into
[28:39] multisig and that really is the word
[28:42] that scares a lot of people
[28:46] because yeah there there's a
[28:50] huge amount of bias here and I feel the
[28:54] bias is from previous years we are doing
[28:58] multisig was admittedly obnoxiously
[29:01] complex
[29:03] absolutely but on the protocol level on
[29:06] the hardware level and on the software
[29:08] level things have changed so
[29:09] significantly mul really is more
[29:11] approachable and indeed that tweet uh
[29:14] really blow up blew up that was really
[29:16] interesting to see um people resonating
[29:20] with okay and that's just an arbitrary
[29:22] number right I think I'll setting I'll
[29:24] settle on uh 21 levels of um Bitcoin
[29:27] security
[29:29] uh just because um but I think this is a
[29:32] really good
[29:33] pointer so so in the in the in the book
[29:37] you're also going with with the level
[29:38] system and you're trying to get to 21
[29:41] levels well um this seems to be
[29:44] resonating a lot
[29:46] um there I think the beautiful thing
[29:50] is Evergreen
[29:52] principles like an air gap and these
[29:56] things they hold up they are not
[29:58] inventions from bitcoiners these are uh
[30:02] validated approaches methods from within
[30:05] the cyber security
[30:07] realm um so it can it's it's going to be
[30:11] a combination of um led by Evergreen
[30:15] principles um entropy air gaps
[30:19] inheritance planning
[30:22] many um vetted approaches that aren't
[30:26] invented by by bitcoiners and just th
[30:28] threw them together
[30:30] but um boiling down to to more specific
[30:34] things is very valuable because people
[30:37] you can talk about multi sick all day
[30:40] and then they're like okay yeah that
[30:41] makes a lot of sense I really don't like
[30:43] my single point of failure pass phrase
[30:46] yeah that's fun
[30:47] Shamir okay let's let's do multi sick uh
[30:50] and they really can be convinced
[30:54] rather I mean yeah bitag doesn't
[30:56] convince we're just here to help but it
[30:58] it seems to become way more popular and
[31:01] the
[31:02] levels you can find where you are and
[31:06] then think about okay I want to upgrade
[31:08] I I don't want to jump straight into a
[31:11] full called three of five multi because
[31:13] that can be dangerous you might
[31:15] introduce mistakes but okay I might look
[31:18] at a second device or or and that's I
[31:21] think the value of these levels that you
[31:24] can start to become you can prepare
[31:26] yourself
[31:28] for the next step and just ease into it
[31:33] build a wallet like that uh a hybrid 203
[31:36] multi with one hotkey and and not
[31:38] immediately move all your funds there
[31:41] and then perhaps when you have some more
[31:43] funds in there you can create a new
[31:45] wallet a three or five multii and just
[31:47] play around with it and get comfortable
[31:49] and and um
[31:52] upgrade uh in in in that way so I think
[31:56] do think the levels are very valuable
[31:59] because it it's it's very specific and
[32:01] people want specifics okay you can talk
[32:04] about ever green principles all day but
[32:07] which button do I press yes I want it
[32:10] give me the security is it it's
[32:13] interesting for me like you you start
[32:15] with multi on level nine so everything
[32:18] beforehand is single s if I see the
[32:21] correctly correct so single s pass phace
[32:24] and then level eight yeah single it's
[32:26] it's a single s but it's it's already
[32:29] decentralized uh and actually level six
[32:31] is already decentralized and
[32:33] decentralization real here is one of
[32:37] these ever green principles again right
[32:40] um I believe that is the most powerful
[32:44] aspect of Bitcoin not just the
[32:48] security um the decentralization we can
[32:51] have a super secure system if it's not
[32:53] decentralized if you have a single point
[32:54] of failure there's no point in having
[32:56] the security if you have one
[33:00] um entity that can control everything
[33:03] and that's and that's what a achieved
[33:06] here starting from level eight that you
[33:09] can have a pass fre then you have two
[33:11] components and you can have two
[33:12] components in in two
[33:14] different
[33:16] um areas that you're geographically
[33:19] distributed and and you eliminate in
[33:22] some sense if you have multiple backups
[33:24] uh the single point of failure and then
[33:27] level eight the shamier secret sharing I
[33:30] mean doesn't really matter about what
[33:32] what number of level it has right
[33:33] because in the uh final system it'll be
[33:37] a different level but what the beauty
[33:40] about Shamir secret sharing is that it
[33:42] is decentralized you have one seat you
[33:44] cut it into three or five or seven um
[33:48] pieces and you need x amount of pieces
[33:53] to reconstruct same with multistick but
[33:55] with with multistick you have
[33:57] decentralized control also so those are
[34:01] that that those are
[34:03] the the the the Evergreen principles
[34:06] that we can see implemented on a very
[34:08] specific level and and be very
[34:09] approachable I mean a two or three multi
[34:11] wall with one hotkey in blue I once made
[34:14] when I didn't have X premium again and
[34:16] you're limited to 200 characters
[34:19] creating a multi wallet in one tweet two
[34:21] images two QR codes one hotkey going
[34:23] into blue it's really easy it's really
[34:26] not that difficult that how people think
[34:29] you just need to be aware of these of of
[34:32] these principles and output the scriptor
[34:33] of course lot of people they're very
[34:36] scared of this horrible thing called an
[34:39] output Des scripture but
[34:41] um yeah it's beautiful that you can cut
[34:44] it up into pieces you don't have to jump
[34:47] straight into the more advanced things
[34:49] and you can take it gradually start with
[34:50] one get it off an exchange go a hardware
[34:53] wallet grab an air gapped one make sure
[34:56] take care of your backup and and take it
[34:59] from there upgrade step by step every
[35:02] cycle like once every four years when
[35:04] the value of your assets has increased
[35:07] significantly and you should probably
[35:09] upgrade if you're not selling then it
[35:12] would make sense to upgrade at least a
[35:14] couple of levels uh every cycle what is
[35:19] the what is the Bitcoin amount where you
[35:22] say like you you don't have any excuse
[35:25] you have to have multi-c like you you
[35:28] you just have to get on a decent amount
[35:31] of uh mtis signature with like
[35:34] redundancies in there and stuff like
[35:36] that that's a that's a very hard
[35:38] question because it's
[35:40] subjective
[35:41] and approaching this as I said uh the
[35:46] most beautiful and and durable way to do
[35:49] it is with these Evergreen principles
[35:52] and you it's it you can't put an
[35:55] objective number on it I will answer
[35:58] your question so that but but I just
[35:59] want to um throw up this
[36:01] disclaimer of
[36:04] um there is no truth here I've worked
[36:07] with clients who are very
[36:09] uncomfortable with their setup that
[36:13] isn't all that much in Fiat value but
[36:16] it's their life savings and they want to
[36:19] upgrade it into multisig way before six
[36:22] digits way
[36:24] before and it has become very viable uh
[36:28] for normies to do that we can talk about
[36:31] how or or how easy that gets but I mean
[36:34] to answer your question I think six
[36:38] digits is because it has become so
[36:42] approachable viable the first entry
[36:45] level right one hotkey on your phone on
[36:48] Blue wallet it's so simple blue wallet
[36:51] is such a beautiful piece of software
[36:54] you got two buttons send receive and
[36:57] thenk QR codes
[36:59] beautiful 5 years ago you had to
[37:02] electrum do
[37:05] multisig horrible or and then if you
[37:07] wanted to do it
[37:08] airgap um with SD cards horrible I P the
[37:13] people who do air gaps with SD cards um
[37:17] so that number has come down the Fiat
[37:21] value that you have to jump into
[37:24] multi um because it has become so so
[37:26] more um so much more approachable pbts
[37:30] on the protocol level have been in the
[37:32] protocol
[37:34] 2019 that's relatively new it's younger
[37:37] than most bitcoiners air gapped Hardware
[37:40] with cameras that was another
[37:42] requirement to make it really
[37:44] approachable those are also very
[37:47] relatively new and then the software
[37:49] that supports the
[37:51] pbts uh with scanning the QR codes and
[37:54] you can just do multi Now by scanning QR
[37:56] codes so that number used to be a lot
[38:00] higher but I feel actually it's it's
[38:02] significantly way below six digits but
[38:05] now we're getting very subjective here
[38:06] this is my very personal opinion because
[38:08] I realize how approachable it is proper
[38:12] multistick is still hard there's a lot
[38:15] of gutches but just like sing Single
[38:18] doing single s there's a lot of trust
[38:21] involved even doing it with dice did you
[38:24] verify on second device or did you
[38:26] really trust the vender there's a lot of
[38:30] GES if you want to do it properly it can
[38:33] get complex really easy but starting six
[38:38] digits uh think about multic
[38:42] definitely I partnered up with coin
[38:45] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[38:48] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[38:51] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[38:54] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[38:57] perfect perf Bitcoin watch that's the
[38:59] perfect subtle elegant way to go out
[39:02] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[39:05] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[39:08] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[39:11] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[39:15] watch collections you have the date of
[39:17] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[39:20] there and of course also the block
[39:22] height and which EPO we are currently in
[39:26] I love the level of detail they put in
[39:29] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[39:31] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[39:34] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[39:37] love those watches so so much if you
[39:40] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[39:42] regular basis I'll guess you already
[39:44] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[39:47] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[39:50] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[39:53] personal recommendation for Hardware
[39:54] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[39:57] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[39:59] gift for a friend who has still their
[40:02] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[40:05] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[40:08] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[40:12] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[40:15] to really level up your sovereignty as
[40:17] an individual you have to have the most
[40:20] secure self cust setup you have to
[40:22] secure your own devices you have to
[40:25] protect your privacy you have to set up
[40:28] an inheritance plan and depending on
[40:30] where you live you even want to have a
[40:33] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[40:36] in case something goes really really
[40:37] wrong and through all those steps the
[40:39] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[40:42] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[40:45] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[40:49] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[40:52] how you can level up your sovereignty so
[40:55] like uh starting from currently one
[40:57] Bitcoin you should definitely think
[40:58] about it actually yeah yeah it's it's
[41:01] good it's it's a good I I like the
[41:03] Bitcoin is said like a a round uh number
[41:07] where you can easily calculate now it's
[41:09] like if you have all satosi you can
[41:11] easily calculate that like if if you
[41:13] have like few Sates in your wallet and
[41:15] you want to pay like for for a drink in
[41:17] like a restaurant where they take
[41:19] Bitcoin it's like easier to calculate
[41:20] all the things um it it is really cool
[41:24] interesting what do you think about
[41:26] collaborative sick with uh a company
[41:30] like car or Unchained or something like
[41:33] that I think these options
[41:35] are
[41:37] beautiful it allows people
[41:41] to um introduce decentralization in
[41:45] their setup which again is that
[41:47] Evergreen principle that we should
[41:48] really strive for eliminate single
[41:50] points of failure and these principles
[41:52] are what make it beautiful I believe but
[41:55] the beauty of Bitcoin is the self-
[42:00] custody right and to me that's black or
[42:06] white that's black and
[42:08] white
[42:10] um you need to be able to control it
[42:13] yourself and it's not because you're
[42:15] using these services that you're not
[42:17] able to control it yourself but if
[42:19] you're not perhaps maybe it's not black
[42:21] and white yeah I want to take that back
[42:25] but the approach a bit Saga here really
[42:28] is teach it how it's done in complete
[42:31] self- custody that's the most beautiful
[42:34] implementation the most free
[42:38] implementation that you hold full
[42:40] control and then do collaborative
[42:44] custody within your
[42:47] family introduce your your your siblings
[42:51] your parents um you have orange pilled
[42:54] your family by now right and they hold
[42:57] some Bitcoin so do multisig with do
[43:00] collaborative multisig with them and
[43:03] that's what we often do also with
[43:05] clients it's it's often it's individuals
[43:08] but also often it's um multiple people
[43:12] of families and one key is going to be
[43:14] here and one key is going to be there
[43:16] and it's geographically distributed and
[43:18] not one person can run with
[43:21] it and and yeah I feel that's the more
[43:25] beautiful implementation of that
[43:27] you maintain more freedom that's what
[43:30] it's all about Freedom
[43:33] um I think they are a good step up um
[43:37] for
[43:38] businesses um
[43:40] but also individuals I think they're
[43:43] great it's just preferences some people
[43:45] are going to prefer these approaches but
[43:50] the family based collaborative
[43:53] multisig um is what I would suggest to
[43:57] think to consider first I
[44:00] always I always like to bring them up
[44:02] because I like to um look into the
[44:06] mainstream and currently I think the
[44:08] mainstream isn't even doing any self-
[44:10] custody like when we look in the
[44:12] mainstream of Bitcoin not like not even
[44:15] factoring the people that don't even
[44:16] have Bitcoin right now just figuring out
[44:19] like who all has Bitcoin and I think the
[44:24] majority of it and a lot of studies and
[44:26] a lot lot of like things kind of kind of
[44:30] get get behind that like most people
[44:32] still don't have self custody it's like
[44:33] a small amount of people in self custody
[44:36] than like people that have it on
[44:38] Exchange I know a lot of friends of mine
[44:40] still have it in exchange and I'm like
[44:42] that's that's ridiculous um and then I
[44:45] look at the the things that keep people
[44:49] from that and it's just education part
[44:52] but it's also the reality of most people
[44:55] like like if you have
[44:57] it's the same thing that keeps people
[44:59] from getting into Bitcoin it's the it's
[45:02] they they don't have time to really look
[45:04] at what's going on with financial system
[45:07] and if they have time to get into
[45:09] Bitcoin now they don't have time to
[45:12] research how to do proper self- custody
[45:15] a book where where everything is
[45:17] summarized is already a major step
[45:19] forward um and hopefully they can do it
[45:22] after that but they still a feeling
[45:26] maybe alone
[45:27] they need they need someone so like
[45:31] that's I'm like okay what is the most
[45:34] mainstream uh friendly approach which
[45:38] also has kind of the most Security in
[45:43] mind so like what is the balance between
[45:46] really mainstream friendly to onboard a
[45:49] lot of people but in the same time BS
[45:53] because there are like the Bitcoin
[45:54] advisory out there that does uh two out
[45:57] of three where two keys are not with
[46:00] them I'm like okay I don't like that
[46:03] that's really interesting that self City
[46:05] and you don't have the majority of the
[46:06] keys that that I I don't like I don't
[46:09] like any setups where I don't have the
[46:11] majority of the keys I would never
[46:13] recommend that but maybe in some cases
[46:15] it's the it's a good setup for for them
[46:18] um but in a in a majority of like okay
[46:22] it has to be easy it has to be a
[46:23] structured process there has to be some
[46:25] some some product around that but it
[46:27] still has to be multi sick and it still
[46:30] has to be super easy to get in there and
[46:35] I like a lot uh I mean uh what what the
[46:37] Bitcoin way what advisers like what
[46:40] yourself are doing I'm just asking like
[46:43] okay what what is because obviously if
[46:46] you do it yourself and you really
[46:48] educate yourself as good as possible
[46:51] it's more secure and it's better for you
[46:53] but I'm also thinking like what what
[46:55] will be the mainstream doing and I'm
[46:57] really fearful that the mainstream is
[47:00] just keeping on on
[47:01] Exchange you get what I'm trying to say
[47:04] like H obviously if you want to do it
[47:06] yourself like you have to educate
[47:07] yourself you have to be fully s uh fully
[47:11] self Sovereign you have to uh do the
[47:14] family self custy collaborative thing uh
[47:17] or other like whatever you can do in in
[47:19] maybe you don't have a family where you
[47:21] can do that or you don't trust them or
[47:23] like whatever like you can still do it
[47:24] yourself and do self custody with multii
[47:27] um but I I want to close the gap from uh
[47:31] so many people having an exchange to
[47:33] moving them to multi and uh it I'm
[47:37] thinking a lot what's the best way here
[47:40] and obviously Kasa and an are not not
[47:42] even a sponsor here and stuff like that
[47:44] but uh I I'm thinking of what what would
[47:47] be the best way to move as many people
[47:50] as possible uh as easy as possible do
[47:55] the uh most secure multi uh self custody
[48:00] setup where they actually also do it uh
[48:03] because most people are like completely
[48:05] lazy and then you cannot be lazy and and
[48:08] people still lose money also with with
[48:11] uh M sake like the less because there's
[48:15] in tendency and stuff like that but yeah
[48:17] like I just blot out like a lot of my
[48:19] thoughts now but what what are you
[48:21] thinking about um uh moving the
[48:24] mainstream onto self- custody Maybe
[48:26] don't even have to do that because
[48:28] mainstream has to be on lightning and
[48:30] maybe on bitcoin Banks maybe that's a
[48:32] future
[48:33] also yeah so that's a that's a scaling
[48:36] question you're entering there uh at at
[48:38] at the end let's let's not go into that
[48:41] one um
[48:43] the self custody so I get a lot of
[48:49] questions what's the best Bitcoin
[48:52] Hardware wallet Rob and and that's
[48:55] that's an answer I I read really have to
[48:58] fundamentally refuse to give because
[49:02] that's that's the beautiful thing of
[49:03] Bitcoin I my stack is different than
[49:06] yours everyone's stack is different
[49:09] everyone's background is different
[49:11] everyone's preferences risk profile
[49:14] every factor that is relevant here is
[49:17] different for everyone so
[49:19] they really is no one siiz fits-all
[49:25] solution I personally have a very strong
[49:28] preference for a specific Hardware
[49:30] wallet and I'm not going to name it this
[49:33] time because I'm going to get I always
[49:36] get these you're an official reseller
[49:38] you just get I'm not sponsored by anyone
[49:43] anything um besides hardware and
[49:46] software agnostic and I think that
[49:48] that's our that's just our approach and
[49:50] these principles I think there we look
[49:52] at your specific
[49:54] situation and
[49:57] it this this Hardware is a great fit for
[50:00] you what's your platform you're on
[50:02] laptop you're on
[50:04] mobile uh what do you want to do going
[50:06] forward what is your transaction
[50:07] frequency what's the amount you store
[50:10] and then we go from there and every
[50:12] solution that we Implement is stal or
[50:15] fit that's the signature service it's
[50:18] it's it takes many different shapes and
[50:22] sizes that being said I do also want to
[50:26] pick up on on what you I mean the the
[50:29] the word easy you drop there that is so
[50:33] important it has to be
[50:35] easy multisig has been in the protocol
[50:38] for so long we could do
[50:41] it uh for for a while but it it has to
[50:45] be easy and now as I said with the
[50:48] changes on protocol Hardware
[50:50] software um it has become easier and it
[50:54] should be come even easier there's a lot
[50:56] lot of Hardware firmware app layer
[51:00] improvements still
[51:02] possible um but blue wallet I'll drop a
[51:06] name here not Hardware but software name
[51:08] I think I think they are beautiful
[51:11] because it is so simple it is the easy
[51:14] they they yeah you got your wallet and
[51:16] you got your two buttons send receive
[51:19] receive you got your address send you
[51:21] scan a QR code boom and there's a lot of
[51:24] Bitcoin wallets out there that have a
[51:26] lot lot of very cool features but a lot
[51:29] of these things don't matter to most
[51:31] people and I think that's a beautiful
[51:33] way to
[51:35] learn um make it easy make the first
[51:38] experience very easy of self- custody
[51:40] right you get it off an exchange and and
[51:43] if people can just scan a QR code um
[51:46] people know scanning QR codes from the
[51:49] Fiat system by now or just in general um
[51:53] so that approach to start out with self
[51:56] custody air gaps I guess
[52:00] are um the beautiful thing here right
[52:03] they increase not only your security but
[52:05] also your usability usually that's the
[52:08] tradeoff that you increase your security
[52:11] but you lose some usability you increase
[52:15] complexity and that's not always the
[52:17] case for example When jumping to air gap
[52:20] there's USB based devices when you use a
[52:23] hardware wallet USB based and you um go
[52:26] to an air gapped one you have increased
[52:29] your security by eliminating the USB
[52:31] platform which is inherently
[52:33] insecure and also increased your
[52:36] usability you have no more buttons to
[52:38] press plugin cables so that's I think
[52:42] what we should strive for to also
[52:45] increase security whilst increasing
[52:48] usability and we've implemented setups
[52:51] from people who are on obnoxious
[52:54] Hardware wallets Ledger
[52:58] and the basic multi setup with one
[53:01] hotkey is more usable
[53:05] than a single janky button USB based
[53:10] device um so yeah I think we should
[53:13] strive for to to implement both and and
[53:16] self- custody it can be it should be
[53:18] easy it should be a nice experience and
[53:20] not scary it's scary for a lot of people
[53:24] and air gaps are a beautiful way I think
[53:26] just starting out with multi and then
[53:28] also to enter starting out with single
[53:31] sck and then to enter multi the air gap
[53:34] the QR based I'm on repeat here I mean I
[53:36] I truly love it can you feel it I truly
[53:38] love it it's beautiful uh that's that's
[53:41] I think the way here even with with
[53:43] single with multi yeah I love how you uh
[53:47] and I fully agree before you even say
[53:49] that I fully agree with the level one as
[53:51] you said here on the Tweet um hot
[53:54] storage on a closed Source [ __ ] shitcoin
[53:56] wallet like Ledger and yeah closed
[53:59] source and shitcoin wallet I fully agree
[54:01] here I mean many of the wallets do also
[54:05] accept other altcoins I don't know is
[54:08] there any
[54:09] true true Bitcoin only wallet like I I
[54:12] don't even know about that but yeah they
[54:14] close source and yeah there it's it's
[54:17] really bad with Ledger it's
[54:18] unfortunately was my first wallet and I
[54:21] got rid of it like I think two years ago
[54:23] something like that uh it's still sit
[54:26] somewhere but there's nothing on there
[54:29] uh but yeah it's uh I I do agree with
[54:32] that they kind of uh made the wrong
[54:35] moves in in the market it could have
[54:37] been a great choice but uh they had a
[54:39] lot of the market share uh and they
[54:42] still have I think but they they never
[54:45] never recommend them still have yeah
[54:49] that's uh it's a it's a bit of a Pity
[54:51] that they have fumbled the bag in a
[54:55] major way
[54:57] but uh they still hold it's some Network
[55:02] effect I guess when you get some brand
[55:04] recognition out there um yeah i' I
[55:08] burned mine
[55:09] ritually uh oh really nice yeah that was
[55:14] just my principle
[55:16] um yeah I mean but it's a it's a let me
[55:23] step on some toes here perhaps because
[55:25] [ __ ] on Ledger is very very popular
[55:27] right and of course I like to [ __ ] on
[55:28] that but it's a great it's been it's
[55:32] been I was going to say it is a great
[55:34] tool to start out it's been a great tool
[55:38] they have onboarded so many people into
[55:41] self- custody right I mean you were for
[55:44] me I have a ledger that was also
[55:47] applicable to me so so let me just
[55:50] phrase it about me here
[55:52] but um you have to relent still innovate
[55:57] you have to focus on the things that are
[56:01] important and that's not
[56:05] shitcoins um there's many exchanges
[56:07] following that path coinbase um who have
[56:12] that brand
[56:13] recognition and that that Network
[56:15] effects I guess to some extent but it's
[56:20] beautiful to see the many different
[56:21] options out there with Hardware wallets
[56:24] with software um
[56:26] and you can configure whatever tickles
[56:30] your pickle I mean multisig is how
[56:33] millionaire secure their Bitcoin but
[56:36] starting out with a simple I mean you
[56:39] can get you can grab a jade but a very
[56:42] budget option or a 3D printed seed
[56:45] signer which could be even cheaper
[56:49] um so there's there's there's so many
[56:52] different options out there um but each
[56:56] of views really requires more attention
[57:00] still that what's we have to focus on
[57:03] that to make the first self custody
[57:04] experience when people are getting their
[57:07] Bitcoin off exchange into uh self-
[57:10] custody easy and nice and oh that's that
[57:14] they like it and that's that's my
[57:18] Approach also here to to apply that same
[57:20] with multi that you enter multis and
[57:22] you're like oh that's not too bad
[57:26] okay I can just do okay well because the
[57:28] full setup takes a while but then
[57:31] actually using it um and that's what we
[57:34] should strive for that um managing
[57:38] your precious freedom to transact and
[57:43] store value uh it shouldn't always be
[57:46] with these Cold Storage sweats right we
[57:48] we all know the cold storage Sweat Make
[57:50] making the the first transaction that
[57:51] can be very scary and also moving
[57:55] wallets so
[57:56] yeah it should it should be you should
[57:59] hammer it on it being being easy we have
[58:02] tons of very secure options out there
[58:04] security is not the main issue here we
[58:07] should really make it more focus more on
[58:12] usability what do you think about uh
[58:14] time locking uh keys to make it less
[58:18] likely that you could lose access uh
[58:20] like like having a key that's activated
[58:23] after 6 months or 12 months of
[58:25] inactivity and something like that I'm
[58:27] glad you um added that uh specification
[58:32] there because time lock used to be to
[58:36] lock down a utxo some
[58:39] Bitcoin
[58:41] where you can't spend it for a year full
[58:45] stop but now you have these expanding
[58:48] and decaying
[58:50] multisig configurations and lyan's
[58:53] really leading the charge here that you
[58:56] can build a two or three multisig and it
[58:59] falls back down into um Lesser Keys that
[59:05] down the road you only need one
[59:07] key uh to sign or it expands new keys
[59:10] become active um I think that is
[59:15] beautiful it's a Pity that it's um so
[59:19] rare that not a lot of harder wallets
[59:22] have implemented it um
[59:26] but various ones are actively working on
[59:30] it I think it's going to become more and
[59:33] more standardized it's also
[59:36] protocol uh based the output descriptors
[59:39] they grow significantly in size but um
[59:43] to by default have a multisig wallet and
[59:47] not be scared you only really need to
[59:50] hold one key because if you lose the
[59:53] others and your output Des scriptor
[59:57] um it just en enables so much more peace
[60:02] of mind and and and confidence and
[60:05] that's
[60:06] really um I use this way too much in a
[60:09] sales pitch so here I go the main
[60:11] product no is not harder wallets nor
[60:14] consultancy but the Peace of Mind at the
[60:16] end of the road and it means different
[60:19] things to different people but the
[60:21] expanding indic multi6 where Keys become
[60:24] active or um loose activity
[60:29] um that is so beautiful in the backup
[60:33] sense that okay something can go wrong
[60:37] um and I only need to hold one key yeah
[60:40] lyanna's doing beautiful things there
[60:42] would love to see some mobile
[60:44] implementation I think is going to be
[60:46] very popular because of that confidence
[60:50] that it gives introducing a backup a
[60:52] backup key two of three two of three
[60:53] multi so you have three keys and then
[60:56] after a year a fourth key becomes active
[61:00] if you haven't made a transaction and
[61:02] it's just rolling right if every time
[61:04] you make a transaction you um extend
[61:08] that time lock um so much things are
[61:10] possible here again there's no one siiz
[61:13] fits-all solution but let's look at your
[61:15] situation what's good for you what's
[61:17] your spending frequency what's your
[61:19] backup solution look like and these
[61:22] these time locks
[61:24] multi um I think are going to be very
[61:27] popular they should be beautiful again
[61:30] huge
[61:32] fan uh but is actually your your book
[61:35] coming out or is it already out the the
[61:37] Bitcoin security not out not out um
[61:41] should be Q3 this year um
[61:47] but yeah I mean I'm coming from software
[61:51] and software deadlines are not met they
[61:53] just aren't met I haven't seen many F
[61:55] software deadlines met so I will try to
[61:58] change that when writing this uh to
[62:00] actually meet that deadline um yeah I
[62:03] think also it's going to be a a a big
[62:06] effort in in writing it in public also
[62:11] um not completely open source but um to
[62:18] be to enable attacks on it that's how
[62:21] you build
[62:23] resilience
[62:24] um to write the different chapters in
[62:27] public and people can criticize it and
[62:29] and add to it um that's going to be a
[62:34] very important part of it and that might
[62:36] delay it I really want to get this right
[62:40] I think it's so valuable uh the how part
[62:45] of besides the the why as we said in the
[62:49] beginning absolutely do you have uh do
[62:54] you focus any time on on security
[62:57] outside of the self cust setup itself
[63:02] like um training for fishing attacks or
[63:06] like like training or like um securing
[63:09] your digital footprint a little bit more
[63:12] like privacy like all those things were
[63:14] like more more in the direction of cyber
[63:17] security and less of like Bitcoin
[63:20] securing definitely uh because that is
[63:23] very relevant um
[63:26] popular
[63:28] product I can grab it um is the ubod the
[63:34] hardware authentication keys where you
[63:36] have two Factor authentication not by uh
[63:39] these onetime passwords by definitely
[63:42] not Google Authenticator but by a
[63:44] Hardware Key um so that you have a more
[63:46] durable robust two Factor authentication
[63:49] setups setup for the accounts that are
[63:53] uh somewhat critical um
[63:56] VPN running your own node it's not just
[64:00] about security privacy is very related
[64:04] to that and it gets um broadly besides
[64:08] that physical security of your
[64:12] property when you are securing
[64:14] significant amounts it's not just cyber
[64:17] security you should be concerned
[64:20] about uh physical security also becomes
[64:26] relevant um at some stage again it's
[64:29] it's about worries what do you worry
[64:31] about um that that bit Saga um assists
[64:36] to solve so you can live in confidence
[64:39] with your self- custody um but not
[64:41] everything people aren't aware of many
[64:44] of the possible attacks that are out
[64:46] there right side Channel attacks oh
[64:48] there's some exotic dangerous people
[64:51] have never heard of them side Channel
[64:52] attacks out there that you really got to
[64:54] put your tin foil add on to um well
[64:57] that's not going to happen to me um but
[65:01] cyber and physical um security the
[65:05] security overall is a very
[65:08] broad um aspect and also it's a it's a
[65:11] process it's not an
[65:14] end point you achieve like green check
[65:17] mark now I am secure technology keeps
[65:20] evolving the value of your assets keeps
[65:22] going up Bitcoin will keep going up
[65:25] you'll have to keep improving your
[65:27] security physical wide cyber um
[65:32] specifically your Bitcoin be aware of
[65:34] your
[65:35] privacy um so yeah there's there's
[65:38] there's a lot to it we
[65:41] take a lot into account
[65:45] um yeah it can get it can get very
[65:49] Advanced and at some point we partner
[65:51] with cyber security firms that do
[65:53] individual screenings
[65:56] um
[65:58] because it it gets it gets very
[66:01] specialized and bit Saga is really
[66:03] focused on the Bitcoin security basic
[66:06] cyber security um Cloud VPN home
[66:11] networking big one also that we help
[66:14] with people's home network are trash
[66:17] with relation to security all these iot
[66:20] devices it's horrible people love to
[66:22] turn on their lights or whatever manage
[66:25] it from their phone and these are
[66:29] security holes
[66:32] often set up a guest Network throw these
[66:35] janky insecure iot devices on your guest
[66:38] Network and um split it off uh is the
[66:44] main message there
[66:46] so yeah security is very Broad and it
[66:49] depends on the setup the client
[66:53] the what can be approved there always
[66:55] something to improve not every um
[66:59] Improvement not necessary to uh set up
[67:04] physical
[67:05] cameras with um on location backups
[67:09] everywhere in some cases in a lot of
[67:12] cases that's just ridiculous um so it
[67:15] there's again there's no one siiz
[67:17] fits-all approach here it's depending on
[67:20] the situation but it's very wide
[67:22] security it's very wide absolutely and I
[67:25] think that's where also we we kind of
[67:28] close the maybe the the the loop to
[67:31] where Bitcoin security is also going
[67:34] with like there's different people that
[67:36] want different uh uh setups and uh
[67:40] different security aspects of it and
[67:43] there will be probably in the future be
[67:45] a wide variety of different offerings
[67:48] Services products whatever and uh that
[67:53] that's what's kind of I'm hoping I'm I'm
[67:54] just hoping that most of the products
[67:56] and services focus on self- custody but
[67:59] that's just my hope and my my effort uh
[68:03] in in this community to bring as many
[68:05] people on self- custody uh if you have a
[68:09] decent amount of Bitcoin also on Multi
[68:11] signature uh I love that you're a multi
[68:14] Maxi uh I I'm I also am one uh and I
[68:19] discovered mulc very late uh uh
[68:22] basically last year I discovered very
[68:26] late I was already almost four years
[68:28] into Bitcoin and didn't have multi
[68:29] signature and I was I had I had self
[68:32] custody from day one uh literally bought
[68:35] uh uh one day after I bought my first
[68:39] Bitcoin on coinbase obviously uh and
[68:42] bought then a
[68:44] ledger uh so the two companies that I
[68:47] now avoid uh heavily and just don't
[68:50] touch uh I used in the beginning uh so
[68:53] also like kudos to them like they are
[68:55] oning a lot of people they also doing a
[68:57] lot for the Bitcoin so like that's what
[68:59] you're saying is that that's that's
[69:01] really important also uh but yeah we we
[69:03] kind of have to move
[69:05] towards multi signature self custody and
[69:08] just it's a journey of of taking
[69:10] security and self-
[69:12] responsibility uh on to a whole another
[69:15] level which brings me maybe to my last
[69:17] question today um what do you think will
[69:21] this do to our society if at all
[69:24] something if we now have an asset where
[69:28] you can be your own bank and you can be
[69:31] completely self- Sovereign uh and you
[69:34] now have the possibility to kind of be
[69:38] outside of any system and still
[69:41] function um where we don't have um a mom
[69:46] or dad be not our literally parents have
[69:49] like talking about the state and the
[69:52] banks kind of dealing above us and like
[69:54] oh yeah if your money gets stolen you
[69:56] have some insurances if if if you forget
[70:00] your password no worries verify yourself
[70:03] on the banking app you get your access
[70:05] again and like that kind of very
[70:08] protected space to more a self sovern
[70:11] space with more self- sovern world do
[70:14] you think we we'll get there and what
[70:17] what will that change or are we more
[70:19] moving towards this an different asset
[70:22] but same ecosystem yeah I love that
[70:25] question
[70:25] let's go broad here I
[70:28] believe in got a toolkit here
[70:34] um that's got a quote that that comes to
[70:37] mind by Uncle
[70:39] Ben um with great power comes great
[70:44] responsibility and I believe that's what
[70:46] Bitcoin is giving
[70:49] us
[70:51] freedom and
[70:53] responsibility and we
[70:56] never in history had the amount of
[71:00] Freedom that we can have on a Bitcoin
[71:06] standard and I think that's going to
[71:08] also by some measure like never before
[71:12] seen increase the responsibility on an
[71:14] individual level um that we have to take
[71:19] and that will enable like the low time
[71:24] preference thinking I think it
[71:27] all weaves
[71:30] together
[71:32] into a state a new State of Mind of of
[71:37] Freedom self- custody low time
[71:40] preference
[71:41] thinking you can't have all the the the
[71:45] benefits without yeah the the the the
[71:47] responsibilities and I think that that's
[71:50] uh it's it's going to empower us more
[71:56] um and value what we have um yeah self
[72:00] custody I think the low low time
[72:02] preference thinking it's it's going to
[72:04] be such a cultural
[72:07] shift maybe even the greatest gift that
[72:11] Bitcoin is is going to give us on a on a
[72:15] cultural aspect um and then the the
[72:19] it'll naturally fit in with the
[72:21] responsibilities that we have to take if
[72:25] you want to self- custody this Freedom
[72:27] technology properly so I think it'll
[72:30] it'll be part of a broader
[72:34] Awakening um to do it properly right now
[72:38] because we haven't had it before might
[72:40] sound heavy that there is no one like a
[72:43] parent to take care of
[72:45] you but I think it connects really well
[72:49] with the more durable approach of the
[72:52] sovereign
[72:53] individual yeah
[72:56] I also think so and we we need that
[72:59] future and I I do hope so that we get
[73:01] there um I have a question that I ask
[73:04] each and every one of my guests and the
[73:05] question is what can we learn from you
[73:07] besides Bitcoin besides Bitcoin I love
[73:10] to it's difficult not to tie it to
[73:14] bitcoin again
[73:17] um I think having it all and not wanting
[73:23] anything like Like the quote that comes
[73:27] to mind by Tyler
[73:31] Duran um from The Fight Club ah you're
[73:35] not your [ __ ]
[73:37] cockies things you own end up owning
[73:41] you um because I strive to be successful
[73:47] and uh with relation to bitcoin have it
[73:50] all but the true lesson the most
[73:55] valuable inside perhaps can
[73:57] be that the most valuable thing is our
[74:01] is our time and our loved ones and and I
[74:04] just became a father got a daughter of
[74:08] two months so I might be more awakened
[74:11] to that aspect that yeah love family
[74:16] friends um it's such a cliche but in the
[74:21] most important times you can really feel
[74:23] it to be true
[74:25] that these are the things that really
[74:27] matter and should never be forgotten
[74:31] whatever it is that you're doing yeah I
[74:34] love that family and friends uh and that
[74:37] part comes so often in this part of the
[74:40] podcast I think it really Shines on what
[74:42] the the Bitcoin Community is focusing on
[74:45] and I I just I just love that um really
[74:48] cool we have an entertaining the podcast
[74:50] uh where the previous guest is asking a
[74:52] question for the next guest without
[74:53] knowing who the next guest actually
[74:55] actually is and your question is an very
[74:58] interesting one what is the biggest
[75:00] thing that Bitcoin doesn't fix biggest
[75:03] thing Bitcoin does
[75:05] not fix that's very hard there's a lot
[75:09] of things it affects uh nothing really
[75:13] comes to
[75:15] mind
[75:17] honestly uh biggest thing that Bitcoin
[75:19] doesn't
[75:21] fix I mean nothing would also be uh um a
[75:25] great answer because Bitcoin fixes
[75:27] everything if if you believe that some
[75:30] some believe that in the Bitcoin
[75:31] Community some don't do I I do I do
[75:34] believe it affects most things even like
[75:39] socially um I'm going to I'm going to
[75:42] have to go with
[75:44] with that it does affect maybe not fix
[75:48] but affect positively I'm one of those
[75:51] Believers that it does affect everything
[75:54] because it is so fundamental to us
[75:58] freedom that's what it's about and and I
[76:02] do believe that I fully agree I think
[76:04] it's it's money touches almost
[76:07] everything or is part of actually
[76:10] everything
[76:12] um in in in in most senses like not
[76:16] everything but almost everything um if
[76:19] you don't if you do anything you you
[76:22] kind of have to get some there's always
[76:25] something trading going on like if if if
[76:28] you go somewhere uh if you do something
[76:33] um there is always a form of your
[76:38] physical energy going on your time
[76:41] energy going on but most of the time
[76:43] also your financial energy and this is
[76:47] so fundamental to us that if you
[76:49] exchange that Financial energy and how
[76:52] it fundamentally works it will affect uh
[76:56] you also your physical energy your your
[76:58] mental capacity and stuff like that so I
[77:01] I do subscribe to that also um but yeah
[77:04] like it doesn't fix everything but it
[77:06] affects almost everything that's that
[77:08] maybe that's a good way to to to get it
[77:11] to all right really cool thank you so
