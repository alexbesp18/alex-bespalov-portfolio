[00:00] I am French Canadian and I have escaped
[00:03] Canada the Chinese government has
[00:06] gamified obedience by building up this
[00:09] social credit score system have grown up
[00:11] in Canada and I went to University there
[00:14] start working for a couple of years and
[00:17] it was like witnessing an accident in
[00:19] slow motion it's an unfair competition
[00:21] the game is rigged Bitcoin changes
[00:24] everything it turns that whole system
[00:26] around when I heard about Bitcoin for
[00:29] the first time I was mind blown I said
[00:32] wow yes that will restore the freedom we
[00:35] used to have before I was always running
[00:37] trying to catch up with the hamster
[00:39] wheel I need to get into real estate as
[00:41] fast as possible else I'm going to be
[00:43] stuck in slavery forever I don't have
[00:45] those worries anymore with Bitcoin I
[00:47] know I'm going to be fine and I can
[00:49] focus my mind on the beauty of Life the
[00:53] long as someone is in Bitcoin and it
[00:55] feels like the the more s they have in
[00:58] in life
[01:03] um before we get into all other topics
[01:05] that that you talked about before and
[01:07] that we I I really want to get into um I
[01:11] had already like six or seven guests out
[01:14] of my 2003 you the 203d guest now that
[01:19] actually said said like I don't want to
[01:21] be completely uh Anonymous some actually
[01:24] show the face without uh re revealing
[01:27] the identity but if you show your face
[01:29] you kind of reveal identity to some
[01:31] extent but they don't want to attach
[01:33] their face to to actual name um so I'm
[01:37] always curious um why and what's the
[01:41] what's the motivation uh behind that
[01:44] strategy and and uh it's for me it's
[01:46] like there there's like one really Noble
[01:49] thing in it because you're
[01:51] contributing uh to the Bitcoin Community
[01:54] or whichever Community you're
[01:55] contributing to but in that in that
[01:57] sense Bitcoin
[02:00] and you don't take personal credit for
[02:02] in your name you can always of course
[02:05] after that take the p and as as Daniel
[02:09] Bitcoin Gandalf did recently put your
[02:11] name on top of that that's that's option
[02:14] but till you do that you don't really
[02:16] take credit uh in a personal sense so
[02:18] I'm always really curious uh why you're
[02:21] doing it is it just a safety or a
[02:23] security concern or are there other
[02:25] things to
[02:25] it uh it's both uh look we're Bitcoin
[02:30] right and satosi himself is the biggest
[02:33] example I can think of of someone or
[02:37] many people who made a huge impact by
[02:41] staying Anonymous uh so you don't have
[02:44] to give out your identity uh to talk
[02:48] about ideas um look I'm a big believer
[02:52] in decentralized
[02:55] identities and I do use my real
[02:58] identities uh on other accounts and in
[03:02] my real life uh so I have created many
[03:06] accounts with many levels of
[03:10] anonymity right so
[03:13] um with my real name um I have met other
[03:17] people I do promotion of Bitcoin in my
[03:20] local area where I live and uh I have
[03:24] those conversations uh in my friend
[03:27] group I expose myself as a Bitcoin
[03:30] already to the people around me but uh
[03:34] when I want to have um Express an
[03:37] opinion that is a little bit more
[03:40] sensitive uh I will prefer to do it with
[03:42] an anonymous account and I think uh it's
[03:46] better for me uh to to do
[03:49] so um the other reason you said was it
[03:53] for security concern um look um I am
[03:58] French Canadian and I have escaped uh
[04:03] Canada in the recent years and I have
[04:07] put uh look I'm not ashamed to say I
[04:10] have bought everything in Bitcoin by
[04:13] leaving my country and just by saying
[04:17] that it puts a huge Target on on my back
[04:22] right uh so I don't tell that to people
[04:26] around me in real life but uh I'm less
[04:29] afraid to say it uh
[04:32] anonymously uh on on the internet yeah
[04:36] so uh I I do believe that the the world
[04:39] is kind of turning to [ __ ] right now and
[04:42] Bitcoin is uh is the beacon of Truth for
[04:46] people who want to remain true to
[04:49] themselves and U who believe in a better
[04:51] future but in the same time look hard
[04:55] times are coming and uh I have
[04:58] personally uh experience it by leaving
[05:01] my own country you know uh I've had
[05:04] friends and family turn against me uh I
[05:08] was close to uh close
[05:11] to um be fired for my job you know I
[05:15] quit I I quit my job I left everything
[05:17] behind and I'm quite sure that if I did
[05:20] not
[05:21] quit um some reason will have been made
[05:25] up to make me quit because of who I am
[05:29] because of my personal opinion so I felt
[05:32] the the pressure building up and I just
[05:35] said look I I have to leave before I
[05:39] become a Target H so all of that
[05:41] combined yeah uh I think hard times are
[05:45] coming uh for bitcoiners we can say
[05:48] we're already in hard time but I think
[05:51] it's it's nothing uh compared to what's
[05:54] to come and uh I think by that time uh
[05:59] it it's uh yeah it's better to not have
[06:02] a Target on our back so if I'm going to
[06:04] express some opinions or uh just reveal
[06:09] that I'm Allen in Bitcoin I prefer to do
[06:11] it anonymously that's very fair and
[06:13] that's uh a really good reason also um
[06:17] and I L the what you're saying here with
[06:19] with leaving Canada and hard times are
[06:22] coming I'm myself in in the process of
[06:25] kind of H researching about options uh
[06:29] of okay I'm an Austria I like the
[06:31] country I feel good here but sorry
[06:34] interrupt you a little bit I think you
[06:38] have one of your sponsor is uh has a
[06:41] product about a new citizenship or going
[06:45] abroad if I understood yes uh can you
[06:48] tell me a little bit more about that is
[06:50] it related to that yeah it's it's um
[06:54] it's one of the options that I consider
[06:56] like uh I partnered up with the Bitcoin
[06:58] way because I think that the Bitcoin way
[07:01] is really good in bulletproofing your
[07:04] self custody and asking you all the hard
[07:05] questions that a lot of people don't
[07:07] want to face if they set up their own
[07:09] self custody how to make it as secure as
[07:11] possible um that was the primary reason
[07:13] why I um partnered up with them in begin
[07:17] with but they have a BL B uh they call
[07:20] it the the citizenships uh and they
[07:24] basically um everyone just just to get
[07:27] this out of the way first um if you want
[07:30] to consider that you can book like a 30
[07:32] minute free call and then they just like
[07:34] give you the advantages of of of doing
[07:35] that and and how how it's done and how
[07:37] much it cost and stuff like that I I did
[07:39] it myself with with Tony as this this
[07:41] one options that I consider it's
[07:43] basically a citizenship in in Panama uh
[07:46] for a really affordable price in my
[07:50] sense I don't want to take anything from
[07:52] the Bitcoin way way so so I I I I leave
[07:56] it at that uh but uh this is an
[07:59] interesting option but it also involves
[08:02] me not being in Austria too long
[08:04] otherwise Austria still taxes me that's
[08:07] one of the things that I want to uh not
[08:10] do but Panama is really interesting
[08:11] because you don't have to stay there you
[08:13] basically can stay there the first two
[08:16] years uh you have to be there the for
[08:19] the signing up phase like it's a week uh
[08:21] then after six months you have to come
[08:23] back and sign something and then after
[08:24] two years you have to come back again so
[08:27] it's like you're there three times uh
[08:29] you have a two-year citizenships and
[08:31] then you can extend it for a longer
[08:34] period of time I mean even a permanent
[08:36] one I think but I don't want to talk too
[08:38] much about that because I'm just
[08:41] starting to get into uh exploring those
[08:44] options and I'm not an expert till now
[08:47] like I I I I just want to get this out
[08:49] of the way I want to be an expert in
[08:51] that topic but I'm not not yet uh
[08:55] there's also really close to Austria
[08:58] Switzerland which is is not in the EU uh
[09:01] has a way better uh political and tax
[09:04] system in my opinion uh and basically
[09:06] has the same landscape and L uh
[09:09] landscape in Austria like mountains
[09:11] lakes and and very beautiful uh pictur
[09:14] then of course they're like the the
[09:15] usual options that that are known in the
[09:18] internet like Dubai uh and stuff like
[09:20] that or for people that are really rich
[09:22] Monaco is is an interesting option it's
[09:24] not an option for me financially uh but
[09:27] is one of the if you really have a of
[09:29] money you can consider Monaco uh so
[09:31] there are a lot of options and I'm right
[09:33] now in the facee just of gathering
[09:36] options I'm not even assessing my
[09:38] options till now I'm just Gathering as
[09:40] many options possible uh I'm also
[09:42] setting up some calls with people from
[09:44] Dubai from people from Switzerland from
[09:47] people everywhere from the world and
[09:49] just seeing what what could I do that
[09:52] that's all I'm in that's really
[09:55] interesting and I think that's a real
[09:57] growing Market um when I did it I cannot
[10:01] pretend I'm an expert either you know I
[10:03] just uh picked the best option for
[10:06] myself and it's really um a personal
[10:10] decision in the end uh there is no one
[10:12] answer fit all it's all about you what
[10:16] kind of job you have can it how how
[10:19] remotely what's your uh citizenship of
[10:22] origin and where you want to live what
[10:25] kind of climate what kind of culture are
[10:28] you most familiar with with so there are
[10:30] so many things to take into account and
[10:33] the the the the legal framework also how
[10:36] long it takes to get a new citizenship
[10:38] if you even even want a citizenship you
[10:41] can in some countries you can stay as a
[10:44] resident uh with no problems um and yeah
[10:48] you talk about Panama Panama was uh I
[10:51] seriously considered that option uh
[10:54] finally I decided I wanted to live in
[10:57] Asia so I am talking to you from the
[11:00] Asian an Asian time zone um so I I
[11:04] picked a country in Asia and um I I
[11:10] worked toward a new citizenship in one
[11:13] of those countries and I'm really glad
[11:16] right now because uh it's been yeah it's
[11:19] been a couple of
[11:20] years um I studied how to get a
[11:23] citizenship uh in that country and like
[11:26] the one possibility is to get married uh
[11:29] another one is to spend a lot of money
[11:32] and kind of buy it off uh to like reduce
[11:35] the the the
[11:38] requirements uh but I did not want to
[11:41] sell out of all of my Bitcoins I had
[11:44] already put all my wealth in Bitcoin by
[11:46] that time once I stepped in the country
[11:49] okay I I need to say I have left Canada
[11:54] before
[11:55] deciding uh in which country I was going
[11:58] to settle
[12:00] so I took one year of uh just traveling
[12:05] uh between uh many many countries I it
[12:09] was in
[12:11] 2018 yeah I took the whole year in 2018
[12:15] and I traveled in in many countries I
[12:18] took I took the whole year off and I
[12:20] wanted to spend a couple of months uh in
[12:24] each country and see what the people are
[12:26] like maybe make a make a few friends uh
[12:29] see like how the the the renting rent an
[12:34] apartment situation is how the food is
[12:38] how everything is how basic life is and
[12:41] you really get to experience that by
[12:43] living there uh so I just took the whole
[12:47] year to travel between many countries
[12:50] and by the end of
[12:52] 2018 uh if you were already into Bitcoin
[12:55] at that time it was the time of the the
[12:58] bsv dropped so the price had dropped um
[13:03] it had held the
[13:05] 6,000 the
[13:07] 6,000 uh price price range for the whole
[13:10] year but then after that it dropped down
[13:13] to 3,000 and I said no way I'm going to
[13:17] sell my Bitcoin at that price and I'm
[13:19] not going to buy a s spend all my
[13:22] Bitcoin to buy the citizenship so I'm
[13:25] just going to pull up my sleeve and uh
[13:27] find a job and start working working in
[13:30] uh in a country in a new country and
[13:34] that opened the door to get the work
[13:37] permit uh work visa in uh in a new
[13:41] country uh in one in which I had lived
[13:45] during the year
[13:47] 2018 and yeah I I went back to that
[13:51] country and I am living there since that
[13:53] time and now I have uh the residency
[13:59] criteria filled because I have lived
[14:01] there for long
[14:03] enough uh I have held a job in the
[14:06] country for long long enough so I did
[14:08] not have to spend the money and I am
[14:11] ready to apply for the citizenship this
[14:13] year as as we're talking right now we
[14:16] are uh I'm going to get the last uh last
[14:20] uh translated document process this week
[14:24] and I'm ready to make the final
[14:25] application so uh I'm just crossing my
[14:28] finger and uh I hope my hard work of the
[14:31] last few years will U will will pay off
[14:35] right and I I can attest to how how hard
[14:39] it it can be as I mentioned many times
[14:42] on the podcast that my girlfriend is
[14:44] from India originally and she lives in
[14:46] Austria right now uh with me and I go
[14:49] with her to all the steps how she can
[14:52] just stay in the country like not not
[14:55] even going to citizenship uh and going
[14:57] the passport just staying here and
[15:00] working um there are a lot of
[15:02] requirements a lot of legal documents a
[15:04] lot of uh hurdles and challenges you
[15:08] have to jump through uh to get there I
[15:11] don't know how it's in Asia and other
[15:12] countries I only have I only have to
[15:14] post uh the the the the seeing now from
[15:17] from Austria firstand or second hand
[15:19] kind of uh but it's it's it's already a
[15:22] lot so I can I can attest to that it
[15:24] could could be a lot of hard work and
[15:27] it's long working and and trying to do
[15:29] something and then there's the
[15:30] application tell about the language
[15:33] requirement I had to pass the classes to
[15:37] so uh holding the job pass the uh pass
[15:40] the classes go back to University and um
[15:44] uh have the language class to uh there
[15:46] was a language requirement too so U so
[15:49] that was a hard one too um you mentioned
[15:53] uh before we we as as we talk started
[15:56] talking that you did that as a
[15:59] preparation uh for that hard times are
[16:03] coming um maybe can you can explain us a
[16:06] little bit like what do you define as
[16:07] hard times what do you see coming in the
[16:10] in the future especially to the Western
[16:13] world uh and and so basically like what
[16:15] are you fleeing yeah uh I
[16:19] have lived the before I went away I have
[16:23] grown up in Canada and I I start I went
[16:28] to University there start working for a
[16:30] couple of years and it was like
[16:33] witnessing an accident in flow in slow
[16:36] motion uh it was like
[16:39] seeing seeing everything collapse around
[16:43] me like I I'm used to growing up in a
[16:47] free country where I can say things and
[16:51] now there's more and more sensorship I
[16:53] cannot talk to the people around me
[16:56] people become much colder people because
[16:59] people are more afraid afraid of losing
[17:02] their
[17:03] job afraid of being
[17:06] excluded and I just couldn't live like
[17:09] that and um I used to put a lot of hopes
[17:14] in politics uh during all my 20s I I
[17:20] uh I did not really um get involved in
[17:24] in a party but I was kind of a political
[17:27] nerd I used to follow it really closely
[17:30] and put a lot of Hope into it because I
[17:33] hope we could reverse the situation go
[17:37] back right go back on the right track
[17:41] and stop this decline this uh and
[17:45] everything is declining taxes are going
[17:47] up they're never never going down uh the
[17:51] economic situation is declining for
[17:54] everybody it's getting harder and harder
[17:56] to live and it has Accel at since uh
[18:01] since co co uh but I have witnessed it
[18:06] from from AAR but I I do believe it
[18:09] because it had started a long time ago
[18:12] and everything is uh the the decline is
[18:15] has become a
[18:16] freefall
[18:19] um we're going down and it it's
[18:21] accelerating people are getting poorer
[18:24] inflation has reached the two digits and
[18:28] uh
[18:29] you can see how how
[18:32] in in how the people around you live you
[18:37] you can see the food that is on the
[18:38] table is getting lower and lower H you
[18:41] can see people are getting busier and
[18:43] busier people are losing hope and I
[18:47] could
[18:48] like zoom out and think where is this
[18:53] going and I did not like that and uh
[18:59] um I I used to watch a lot of YouTube
[19:02] I'm still watching a lot of YouTube but
[19:05] uh in the early 2 and 10 there was there
[19:10] was a small YouTube channel about video
[19:12] games that I used to follow called it
[19:15] still exists it's called extra credit uh
[19:18] they're they're Americans and uh one
[19:21] video really strike a chord within me
[19:26] when they start talking about how the
[19:28] Chinese government has
[19:31] gamified uh
[19:33] obedience by uh building up and that was
[19:36] in the early 2000s and 10s yeah uh by
[19:40] building up this social credit score
[19:43] system and uh they they said oh they are
[19:47] going to implement this uh by it's going
[19:50] to be mandatory by
[19:52] 2020 and I was like okay this is where
[19:57] things are going this is the future that
[20:00] I want to avoid at all cost because I
[20:04] know uh I I grew up with computers by by
[20:07] by by Gaming I I
[20:09] just uh I I I just for some reason I
[20:12] just could see where this was going and
[20:16] I did not want to live in a controlled
[20:19] environment I did not want to live in
[20:22] prison there's no way for me to strive
[20:25] in in that situation and but by the late
[20:29] 2010 Yeah by
[20:31] 2017 I could see what I was seeing on
[20:35] podcast in YouTube I could see the
[20:39] TR I I I will be starting to see it
[20:42] around me I would see people around me
[20:46] starting to be afraid of having some
[20:48] conversations at work afraid of being
[20:51] fired uh I could I I had to apply self
[20:56] censorship all the time walk on eggshell
[20:58] at my workplace because uh I wouldn't
[21:02] know if I will be the next victim of
[21:05] some some made of
[21:07] [ __ ] uh and I I had to get out of
[21:10] there I had to get out of there um so
[21:15] yeah yeah that was by 2017 yeah have a
[21:21] question I know that's that's it's it's
[21:24] really interesting for me how uh how how
[21:27] good you observed that and I think like
[21:29] I heard that first with the social
[21:31] credit system that Canada is doing that
[21:34] I think I heard it first like two years
[21:36] ago that TR is actually doing that uh as
[21:40] as they're doing in China but go on with
[21:42] your
[21:43] story well uh I've experienced it I told
[21:45] you my uh I had a a YouTube channel uh
[21:49] before when I was still in Canada that's
[21:52] been banned for the same reason for for
[21:56] that reason uh just because I thought
[21:59] about politically uncorrect incorrect
[22:02] topics right okay so uh I I had put lots
[22:07] of Hope in politics but I could see uh
[22:11] when when Trudeau got elected it was it
[22:15] was such a disappointment I I could see
[22:18] that's that's going in the wrong way I
[22:21] because before that I would I would
[22:23] think we could still change course but
[22:27] when we gave gave that guy full power to
[22:31] go the way China was going I I just lost
[22:37] hope in the local politics in Canada I I
[22:42] started to follow a little bit more
[22:43] American politics and Trump and
[22:45] everything but about Canada I I I I
[22:49] decided no that that
[22:51] country will be gone for some
[22:55] time and uh yeah by that time my
[22:59] my job uh was becoming unsatisfying too
[23:03] um I did not see any Improvement or hope
[23:06] to that it will get better uh I had
[23:10] studied okay I I studied mathematics and
[23:13] statistics at
[23:15] University and uh in in Montreal I uh I
[23:20] started working as a data data analyst
[23:24] and when I started working I I was like
[23:27] w that's great uh uh we have our small
[23:29] team we're going to uh make our survey
[23:32] make it nice uh get our finding uh
[23:36] present present it present it in a
[23:38] beautiful and clear Manner and yeah it's
[23:41] going to be great uh but
[23:45] then we we we did our survey once we uh
[23:50] we it went fine for a couple of years I
[23:53] build up our systems uh I did the
[23:56] programming but I was never shown any
[23:59] credit for it you know the whole
[24:02] organization will take the credit from
[24:05] my hard work but me as a lowend worker I
[24:11] will not get any credit for it and what
[24:14] will get worse is that uh once we start
[24:18] getting a little bit more successful in
[24:20] our project the uh well the other it's
[24:25] was kind of a larger organization right
[24:28] and the other departments will have the
[24:31] the words to say about how we run our uh
[24:36] our
[24:37] projects but um it will not be adapted
[24:41] to like
[24:43] their their their criterias and their
[24:46] way of doing will not be adapted to the
[24:50] uh to to the questions we wanted to ask
[24:52] and the data we would like to find and I
[24:56] was like why do we have to why do they
[24:59] even have a word to say about our
[25:02] project so I would be in a situation
[25:05] where I have to start contacting people
[25:09] and doing a work that I did not anymore
[25:12] believe in because I did not make it
[25:15] myself so I will have to attach my name
[25:19] to a project that I know was kind of
[25:24] failing
[25:26] and uh it's like it's like I will not be
[25:29] paid for actual work I will be paid for
[25:33] taking the
[25:35] [ __ ] and the work you actually do
[25:39] you do not even receive the credit for
[25:43] it so I said no I cannot stay in that
[25:46] environment so I start looking around
[25:49] start looking for a new job but then I
[25:52] realize everywhere is the same it's the
[25:54] same thing it's the same thing
[25:55] everywhere everyone I talk to about the
[25:58] people people among the people I
[26:00] graduated with they will be in the worst
[26:02] of situation than me so I like what the
[26:06] hell what am I supposed to do like uh am
[26:09] I supposed to lick my bus ass to uh get
[26:13] get a promotion like is that the only
[26:16] way to be successful in this country is
[26:18] there because I I chose to study this
[26:22] and to work hard because I want to
[26:24] improve myself and I want to uh to
[26:29] to find data in all that noise I want to
[26:31] be able to see the the trends and be
[26:34] able to present it and to communicate it
[26:38] uh but then that's not what I was hired
[26:40] to do at all I was just hired to uh take
[26:45] the blame when things go wrong and the
[26:48] thing things will go wrong because of
[26:50] decisions I will not be making in the
[26:53] first place so is it the only reason I
[26:56] am paid for so I I start getting really
[26:59] disappointed in my
[27:01] job uh because I was like in my Fiat job
[27:05] I will be Trading My Time trading my
[27:08] giving away my youth my my brain power
[27:11] my health mental health for what in
[27:14] return right um yeah so was disappointed
[27:20] in politics and in the uh in my job too
[27:24] yeah I think that's a really interesting
[27:25] point um I see that I mean it's upside
[27:29] from from Bitcoin actually uh maybe it
[27:32] has a little bit to do with Bitcoin but
[27:34] uh even that point I see more more where
[27:36] people we we haven't feared the a money
[27:41] printer and the closer you stay to the
[27:42] money printer uh especially large
[27:45] corporations that really benefit from uh
[27:49] um cheap credits and they can basically
[27:53] print money themselves they benefit from
[27:56] the system a lot uh in that way uh they
[27:59] can keep employees in in their
[28:02] organizations that basically don't do
[28:05] anything or just there so there is
[28:07] someone that is like the uh there's
[28:10] there's this thing of like having
[28:12] someone to blame as you described it
[28:14] there's this thing of like oh we have we
[28:16] have to put also another woman in that
[28:18] team because there has to be some quote
[28:20] or there has to be some some Asian in
[28:22] that team so like the the quote Asian
[28:25] like there's a lot of um uh BS going on
[28:29] in large corporations uh this is to a
[28:32] large extent I think the F Fiat uh uh
[28:36] fault but is also a human fault I think
[28:39] like
[28:40] this uh some of the fault is just a
[28:43] human thing uh that will not go away but
[28:45] a lot of things I think will be better
[28:47] on a Bitcoin standard when sound money
[28:49] like when money is actually
[28:52] sound but that that's a that's really
[28:55] interesting where I see like more more
[28:57] of my generation like I'm 25 I know
[29:00] people from from that age they want to
[29:03] work for themselves or want to work for
[29:05] a company but want not to want to be in
[29:08] an employment situation they want to be
[29:10] in freelancer and there are some um I
[29:14] forgot his name but there are some
[29:16] someone that was an early investor in
[29:18] really big companies he also got Bitcoin
[29:22] quite early on and he predicted uh that
[29:25] uh all uh uh workers eventually will be
[29:30] freelancer or he said like 95% of of
[29:33] them and the the trend is definitely
[29:35] going there I think in the US it went
[29:37] from like 15% to now 35% in a in like a
[29:41] decade or something like that so if you
[29:43] accelerate that it will uh go further
[29:46] which leads me now to to to my long
[29:49] vended question um how do you think is
[29:53] is Bitcoin changing the the working
[29:55] landscape as as you described it or or
[29:59] or and what elements of it is just human
[30:02] and will never go
[30:04] away by changing the
[30:08] incentives uh you just pointed it out
[30:11] the corporations are not anymore
[30:15] motivated by uh giving a good service to
[30:20] the their customers because they do not
[30:23] get most of their money from their
[30:26] customers anymore they get it from debt
[30:30] because they are close to the money
[30:32] printer or they get it by subsidies by
[30:35] filling forms to uh to to fill out the
[30:40] um uh ESG right the environment en
[30:44] environmental uh [ __ ] criteria uh
[30:48] for for the government uh so that's how
[30:51] they get their money uh so so so what
[30:55] incentives do they get to give people
[30:58] people a good service uh so we end up
[31:03] look the the state have has grown so
[31:06] much and is controlling such a huge part
[31:11] of the economy but even in the part uh
[31:15] in the remaining percentage it's not
[31:17] supposed to be controlling well most
[31:21] public uh no most private corporations
[31:24] are still subject to to that state
[31:27] because most of their money most of
[31:29] their revenue come from come from the
[31:32] debt most of their the the CEOs and
[31:35] their boards are connected to
[31:37] politicians they uh they have whole
[31:41] compliance department so that they will
[31:44] be have a good relationship with the
[31:47] state right so the the the the cheap
[31:52] easy money uh that is uh in the hand con
[31:58] centrally controlled by States and
[32:01] central banks uh give infinite power to
[32:05] the central government to get even the
[32:08] priv supposedly private corporations uh
[32:11] do what the state wants right so we all
[32:15] end up getting uh working for the state
[32:18] one way or another and it gets very
[32:22] difficult for small uh entrepreneur to
[32:26] um to to to to earn a living in that
[32:30] environment because you have to compete
[32:33] with a huge corporations let's say you
[32:36] are a small a small businessman you run
[32:39] a YouTube channel let's say you want to
[32:40] hire someone to do some job well you you
[32:44] need to pay them to work for you but you
[32:47] know they those employees they have the
[32:49] choice by either they can work for you a
[32:52] small business owner or they can have a
[32:55] much much well-paid job working for or
[32:58] uh a corporate entity a large corporate
[33:00] entity so uh it's a it's unfair
[33:04] competition the game is rigged and your
[33:07] question is how does Bitcoin change that
[33:09] Bitcoin changes everything it turns that
[33:13] whole system around it's already upside
[33:16] down it's putting it back uh on
[33:21] upright uh so when you you have hard
[33:24] money that nobody controls so it's a
[33:28] it restores the free market because
[33:31] nobody can cheat the system there is no
[33:34] state that has the power to uh give away
[33:38] easy money to everyone if someone state
[33:41] or not wants hard money the only way is
[33:45] to work for it and how do you work for
[33:48] it you provide a service to the market
[33:52] you provide a service that is in demand
[33:54] by the free market so you have to serve
[33:59] other people and that's the beauty of
[34:01] the the free market it's not a oneway
[34:04] relationship where everyone serves the
[34:07] state and gets nothing in return uh
[34:10] nothing it means it gets fake fake easy
[34:13] money in return right instead everybody
[34:17] serves each other so everybody get
[34:20] richer right in my job if I want to uh
[34:24] to to earn hard money I have to provide
[34:27] a service to someone who wants it and
[34:30] that
[34:31] person has to provide a service to
[34:34] someone else and it doesn't have to be
[34:36] me so it's the only way an economy could
[34:40] scale by keeping people's freedom and
[34:44] that's what that's uh that's how things
[34:47] used to be in the first place that's how
[34:50] we uh civilization got its prosperity in
[34:54] the first place that's uh because of
[34:56] free market we have discovered
[34:58] electricity we can use computers every
[35:01] that's because of free market uh
[35:03] everything we use daily was invented
[35:06] it's because there's some guy who had an
[35:09] idea and um and and um improved the life
[35:15] of other people and got paid for it in a
[35:18] money that was harder than
[35:20] today's and Bitcoin is the hardest money
[35:24] uh that can possibly exist
[35:27] so uh yes it's going to restore things
[35:31] upright uh that's that's how I
[35:33] discovered Bitcoin because I I I I had
[35:36] Lo lost hope in so many things that when
[35:40] I heard about Bitcoin for the first time
[35:44] I was mind blown I said wow yes that is
[35:50] uh that is another future that will
[35:54] restore the freedom we used to have and
[35:57] that's what I want so I'm going to learn
[35:59] about Bitcoin I'm going to learn how it
[36:01] works make sure uh I'm not going to get
[36:05] hacked make sure I'm not going to get
[36:07] scammed and once I have mastered it I
[36:09] have mastered the skills to use it then
[36:13] uh yeah why should I own anything else
[36:16] and why should I even stay there why
[36:18] should I should my life be [ __ ] by
[36:21] staying in Canada if I own Bitcoin and I
[36:23] can be anywhere in the world why why am
[36:26] I even here I can go anywhere anywhere
[36:29] in the world I can go uh where the the
[36:32] life is the best for me so so it changes
[36:36] everything and being an entrepreneur
[36:39] being uh making my own business where I
[36:41] can start my idea I don't have to uh
[36:44] sell myself out to a corporation anymore
[36:47] I don't have to sell out my name give
[36:49] away my mental health anymore I can uh
[36:54] experiment uh with with products with
[36:58] ideas and if I find one that the market
[37:01] wants I can get paid for it and that's
[37:05] that's being uh that's how Humanity
[37:08] improves right so so to answer your
[37:11] question yes Bitcoin that's how I think
[37:12] Bitcoin change everything for everyone
[37:15] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[37:17] a regular basis I'll guess you already
[37:19] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[37:22] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[37:25] keep them secure in a hard wallet my
[37:28] personal recommendation for Hardware
[37:29] wallet is the bit box it's super secure

[38:21] they are the experts in cyber security
[38:24] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[38:27] cure sovereign individual in general and
[38:31] I think there are a lot of like uh some
[38:34] people would always prefer to to stay in
[38:37] within a a bigger organization but for
[38:39] me personally it uh kind of in Unleashed
[38:43] a lot of power uh to work for myself
[38:47] even though uh my prior job was great
[38:50] like I like the people there I like the
[38:52] work there I just did not like the
[38:54] content it was about it security and not
[38:56] Bitcoin if it would be Bitcoin probably
[38:57] would have uh stayed there all my life
[39:00] or at least longer uh and because of
[39:04] that I I not scare you to stay
[39:07] where if I stayed in my prior job uh in
[39:10] in my job that I was before that in my
[39:13] Fe job so I had a fe job before doing my
[39:18] my show here now uh and uh because of
[39:22] that I I really discovered how amazing
[39:26] the feeling is to to work for yourself
[39:28] and and being able to to pay the bills
[39:31] yourself if the things you actually get
[39:34] for from from your work uh even though
[39:38] there's nothing wrong with with being
[39:40] within a
[39:41] organization uh if if that organization
[39:44] uh treats you good and uh serve
[39:46] something greater so yeah I just wanted
[39:49] to to get that out um one thing that I
[39:52] was wondering about um you moved now how
[39:57] did your life already changed what what
[39:59] what did you notice is different from
[40:01] Canada now to to Asia to Asia uh well
[40:05] it's so many things people are different
[40:08] people uh are closer to their family uh
[40:13] I would say family values are very
[40:15] strong I'm in a more I'm not in a big
[40:18] city actually so um it doesn't really
[40:22] apply to me cuz I'm a foreigner here um
[40:27] so
[40:28] so H and uh a difference between I say
[40:33] even even in Canada originally I do not
[40:36] come from a big city in Canada either so
[40:40] what I would say is a difference between
[40:44] North American Small Town versus uh
[40:47] Asian small town where I am right
[40:51] now um is that there's less uh less gsip
[40:57] think people are still even if it's a
[40:59] smaller town I think people leave each
[41:02] other alone for the most
[41:05] part uh they let people do their own
[41:09] things uh and res respect their
[41:14] boundaries maybe not physically because
[41:17] the the population is more it's more
[41:19] it's a more densely populated area uh
[41:22] compared to Canada yes but um psycholog
[41:27] Al socially uh people respect have have
[41:31] more respect for their the the other
[41:34] people's private life it seems to while
[41:38] uh at least where I come from uh there's
[41:40] a lot of gossiping uh families are tied
[41:44] together and everybody looks down on
[41:45] each other uh there a little bit of a
[41:48] well at least in French Canada a crab
[41:51] crab in a bucket mentality where you
[41:54] better not uh stand out uh too much
[41:58] because most people around you are going
[42:01] to try to pull you down uh I would see a
[42:04] lot of that in Canada uh and here I see
[42:08] it less uh both because uh it's Asia uh
[42:13] and also yet only because I'm a
[42:15] foreigner so I have less close contact
[42:17] to uh to to most people I can make
[42:19] friends but yeah that's that's one
[42:22] difference and uh it's a good thing it's
[42:24] good for the for the free market it's
[42:27] uh uh it's e life is just easier for
[42:32] everything if I want to buy something uh
[42:35] the the the stores work hours are are
[42:37] longer it's see things are easier to get
[42:40] while in even in bigger cities in Canada
[42:43] shops close at an early time it's
[42:46] difficult things are difficult to get
[42:48] and thing everything seems more
[42:50] complicated there are taxes uh
[42:54] regulations you're not you're not
[42:56] supposed to carry it that way if you
[42:59] you're supposed to carry what you buy in
[43:02] a special kind of carriage and a special
[43:05] kind of bag so much [ __ ] uh here uh
[43:09] I can I can buy beer alcohol at 24 hour
[43:14] and drink in the street if I like uh as
[43:17] long as I don't do do too much
[43:19] trouble and that's a that's a big
[43:22] difference I think that most people will
[43:25] look down on it but uh it's still it's
[43:28] not illegal I'm not going to get
[43:30] arrested for
[43:31] that is um is in Canada also like the
[43:35] supermarkets closed on Sunday and they
[43:38] are closing like at uh 6:00 p.m. 7 p.m.
[43:41] or how is it in Canada oh well U well uh
[43:45] not that it's not that bad at least when
[43:47] I was there but um it's uh just simple
[43:51] things like the way cities are organized
[43:53] it will be far like you you you need a
[43:56] car to get to the place and um and and
[44:01] yeah um because you will have to get to
[44:05] a to a big chain to a big huge uh large
[44:11] uh grocy star because the smaller chains
[44:14] cannot compete so uh while uh while here
[44:19] uh I can find pretty much anything I
[44:21] want uh at a walking distance so yeah
[44:25] that's that's a huge difference
[44:28] I also don't like that about Austria uh
[44:30] stores uh close on
[44:32] Sundays um you have to get your things
[44:35] before like 7 or 8:00 p.m. sometimes
[44:37] even 600 p.m. uh because everything
[44:41] closes after that uh you basically have
[44:45] to go to like a gas station or a train
[44:47] station uh to go in like a really small
[44:50] Super Market where you can only
[44:52] get small things or trash so uh
[44:57] it's it's it's um I don't I you can
[45:01] really nicely see I think that's a great
[45:03] example how it looks when uh the
[45:07] government is interfering with the free
[45:09] market and Sunday there is the
[45:11] supermarkets closed in Austria but only
[45:14] the supermarkets uh are allowed to open
[45:16] that are inside of a gas station or
[45:20] inside of a train station they are
[45:22] allowed to open all also the the ones in
[45:24] on an airport uh so those are open which
[45:28] means on a Sunday you have to stand in
[45:31] line to get into a
[45:33] supermarket uh and that's because the
[45:36] market uh is efficient but the
[45:40] government uh is uh grabbing into the
[45:44] market and closing in on one particular
[45:46] day but people still want things on a
[45:49] Sunday too so they're standing in line
[45:51] to get things on the supermarket so I
[45:53] think that's a a great example of how
[45:55] when the government tries to inter fear
[45:57] in the market the same thing with money
[45:59] printing uh it creates
[46:01] inefficiencies it creates uh burdens uh
[46:04] and it's it's it's it's a mess I don't
[46:07] know how it's in Asia if they're also
[46:09] closed but probably they are they're
[46:10] open right oh well there's no door store
[46:13] everywhere at any time yeah but look
[46:17] between between Canada look uh Canada
[46:19] likes Canadians like to brag about the
[46:21] Health Care System uh so look some
[46:25] people have get cancer and they cannot
[46:28] get treatment on time to save themselves
[46:31] because the waiting times are too long
[46:33] and that's an effect of of of a
[46:37] centralized economy uh because there's
[46:39] centralized money and uh if the uh if
[46:43] it's a public uh public system on top of
[46:47] that uh those
[46:50] those the free market is a way
[46:55] to to to make to to gge the price to
[47:00] find the right price of things of goods
[47:03] and services and if a government
[47:07] intervention is going to say hey
[47:10] Healthcare is free well uh the the
[47:13] supply of uh nurse and Doctor time is
[47:17] still limited so people are going to
[47:19] have to pay in another way uh reality is
[47:22] reality we cannot avoid that so the way
[47:26] are paying for it is by huge long
[47:29] waiting time and if on top of that the
[47:33] because of the public syst and the the
[47:36] the wages are fixed and uh uh all the
[47:39] money goes to uh to the administrators
[47:42] instead of the doctors and workers well
[47:45] there's no more incentive to uh there's
[47:47] less incentive to give a good work so
[47:49] the quality of the service decrease so
[47:51] if you want to even if you get cancer
[47:53] you you do not get your treatment in
[47:55] time in Canada
[47:57] while here uh look I did not get cancer
[48:00] fortunately but uh I when I needed to
[48:03] meet a doctor have a health check it's
[48:06] part of um of getting the work visa when
[48:08] I anytime I I needed to get a health
[48:11] check done I in half a day it was done
[48:16] so talk about efficiency you know really
[48:20] that's a
[48:21] difference um perfect uh uh let's let's
[48:25] close the topic for a moment because you
[48:27] said something earlier that you have
[48:29] been in in in Bitcoin quite a while and
[48:31] you uh also um uh wrote me that you have
[48:37] been a maxi in Bitcoin since 2016 and
[48:41] you've never touched shitcoins uh which
[48:44] is a really interesting topic for me
[48:47] because I I don't know I I rarely met
[48:50] people that just stick to bitcoin from
[48:53] the beginning uh most of the the Bitcoin
[48:56] learning curve kind of involves uh
[48:59] shitcoins and altcoins uh in there so
[49:04] why and how did you avoid
[49:07] shitcoins right uh that's a good
[49:10] question and uh I was surprised when I
[49:13] started listening to other uh Bitcoin
[49:16] Maxis uh in the more recent years that
[49:20] it seems to be the normal path that uh
[49:23] people who get into Bitcoin have a
[49:24] shitcoin phase and then they get wrecked
[49:28] and then they find oh wait Bitcoin is
[49:30] the real thing okay good uh it was kind
[49:34] of a surprise to me I was like what
[49:37] why why is that I did not have well I
[49:41] think I think my shitcoin phase was real
[49:44] estate I think that's why real estate uh
[49:49] a different shitcoin face that's uh real
[49:51] estate was my
[49:53] shitcoin uh CU I was disappointed in my
[49:56] job I was disappointed in politics but I
[50:00] still had hope of staying in Canada in
[50:03] back in 2016 because I had just bought
[50:07] my condo so I finally made it you know I
[50:11] I I I sacrifice so much of my of my hard
[50:15] work to finally um do the move and buy
[50:19] buy my condo so get my mortgage and uh
[50:22] yeah uh and that was a big step for me
[50:25] because since I I was growing up I left
[50:28] my small town to live uh live in a
[50:31] bigger city and I I just noticed how
[50:34] much of my money was wasted on rent and
[50:38] I couldn't move back with my parents so
[50:41] I was like okay uh I I I I kind of
[50:44] understood at a very early age that the
[50:47] money was
[50:49] depreciating and that if I wanted to
[50:52] avoid working out all my life for
[50:55] nothing I had a soon as possible to get
[50:59] a harder asset and real estate because
[51:03] that's where my money was going I was
[51:05] wasting most of my money in rent H so
[51:09] yeah so so so I went to school study
[51:12] hard got a job did all the sacrifice got
[51:15] my mortgage and found bought my condo
[51:19] and then I realized wait
[51:22] um there's so much money we spend on
[51:24] taxes and uh just that I I I expected I
[51:29] expected the taxes um it was part of the
[51:32] calculation so I said okay that's going
[51:34] to be fine but wait taxes are increasing
[51:38] year after year because governments are
[51:41] bankrupt and they are not going down the
[51:44] the so not only the amount of tax you're
[51:46] paying is increasing the
[51:49] percentage is increasing and the
[51:52] percentage of the value is increasing
[51:55] and the value is going up too so the
[51:58] actual money you pay in taxes is going
[52:00] up much faster than I had expected and
[52:04] there's all kinds of regulations so I
[52:07] bought my condo and uh so okay I I I
[52:11] want to uh I'll go to the board meeting
[52:14] because I want to see how my money is
[52:16] managed right uh so I go there and it's
[52:19] all a bunch of baby boomers who uh
[52:23] protect their uh their own interest
[52:25] right and it's like not in my backyard
[52:28] and they make uh regulations to uh to to
[52:32] to to protect the shortterm high time
[52:36] preference value of the condo they can
[52:40] they can rent and
[52:41] trade instead of the long-term value the
[52:45] low time preference value of their asset
[52:49] so uh you pay you pay when you own real
[52:52] estate you pay uh homeowner association
[52:55] fees right and that money is supposed to
[52:57] go to clean up garbage collection like
[53:00] maintenance right and the safety fee to
[53:04] um in case of an emergency something
[53:07] happens well that money uh was was taken
[53:12] was stolen it went into lawyer fees and
[53:15] it just happened that that lawyer was a
[53:17] friend of a guy in the board so it's I
[53:21] saw it's all corrupt it's all corrupt
[53:24] it's not uh it's um it's overblown it's
[53:28] uh uh it's going to crash it it's
[53:32] um the price is too high it's not worth
[53:35] that price so I was already looking for
[53:37] a harder asset and I got disappointed in
[53:40] real estate too and then in
[53:43] 2016 I I I listened to the Joe Rogan
[53:48] podcast uh Andreas antonoplos was on the
[53:52] jogan podcast in August 2016
[53:57] and we talk about Bitcoin and it's it it
[54:01] reach me it just connect all the dots
[54:05] because I was looking for a harder money
[54:08] all my life he talked he talked
[54:12] about uh that we he said we have the
[54:15] choice between two Futures one in which
[54:19] uh because cash is on the way out and
[54:22] the future will be digital money so what
[54:26] kind of digital money do we want do we
[54:29] want a chines like social credit digital
[54:33] money where everybody is watched and
[54:36] surveilled or we want a decentralized
[54:39] digital
[54:40] money uh I was already familiar with uh
[54:44] with decentralized system I I had
[54:47] learned Linux already I was familiar
[54:50] with uh uh the bit torant protocol so
[54:55] when
[54:57] he mentioned Bitcoin that's just a name
[55:01] uh was familiar to me because that
[55:03] sounded like bit torant right and I
[55:06] remember Napster back in the day got
[55:09] sued and uh taken out of business it was
[55:12] a music sharing service uh because it
[55:15] was a company but uh the bit torant
[55:19] protocol still exists today you can
[55:22] still share FES peer-to-peer with other
[55:24] people so when I learned about Bitcoin I
[55:27] already understood that was a
[55:29] peer-to-peer monetary Network wow that
[55:34] uh I was mind blown so I said yeah I'm
[55:37] going to get into it so I uh back in
[55:41] Montreal there was the Bitcoin Embassy
[55:44] place it was a place I think it was
[55:46] created by Francis buot right uh I did
[55:50] not meet the guy but when I went there
[55:52] it's the first time I bought Bitcoin for
[55:55] the first time right and I put it into
[55:58] my wallet I talk to the people there uh
[56:01] introduced me to bitcoin how it works
[56:04] yeah this is your address oh
[56:06] congratulation you got your first
[56:07] Bitcoin and by the way we also sell some
[56:11] ethereum and then I I kind of I kind of
[56:15] got it I I I kind of U uh yeah I just
[56:19] got it I said oh that's how they are
[56:22] going to attack
[56:25] Bitcoin by
[56:27] taking newcomers like me when they get
[56:31] they hear about Bitcoin and they want to
[56:33] get it they're going to divert their
[56:36] attention into buying something that
[56:40] prom promise bigger returns or
[56:44] whatever and yeah so I I said no I'm
[56:48] going to stay away from that so I did
[56:51] not buy any shitcoin just stick to
[56:53] bitcoin that's super interesting uh uh
[56:57] uh to it it's like you're saying that uh
[57:01] altcoins are an attack Vector on bitcoin
[57:04] basically right it's the it's the only
[57:07] kind of successful one I mean successful
[57:10] in a sense because it it it's diver it's
[57:13] it slows down the adoption of Bitcoin it
[57:16] diverts Newcomer's
[57:18] attention people who will like to invest
[57:21] in Bitcoin people who need it the most
[57:23] they are pushed away by the noise by the
[57:26] all the scams [ __ ] coins that are
[57:28] booming around
[57:30] it uh some set of very special
[57:35] circumstance made it such that I I I I I
[57:40] knew uh I needed harder money I did not
[57:43] want to get banned I learned about Linux
[57:46] I had known about decentralized system I
[57:49] wanted to avoid a Chinese like social
[57:52] credit system all of this together made
[57:54] it that the the connected and I saw uh
[57:58] Bitcoin is the only hard asset I just
[58:00] saw it so when other shitcoin popped up
[58:03] popped up around it I was like oh no
[58:06] I've I already had real estate why
[58:08] should I no no no I don't want
[58:12] that uh but for most other people they
[58:17] yeah it's there's going to be some pain
[58:20] uh necessary to so for them to
[58:24] learn I just wanted to to see if I find
[58:27] the the page but I don't find it right
[58:29] now there's a uh a site that shows
[58:32] what's the Bitcoin dominance without
[58:35] stable coins because for me it's called
[58:37] coin Market Capcom oh on coin market cap
[58:40] oh interesting uh yeah well it must not
[58:43] be the only one but on top of the site
[58:45] you can they have the
[58:47] indicator it's AIT dominance but but the
[58:50] Bitcoin dominance without um stable
[58:53] coins also because most them have the
[58:57] stable coins inside them uh and I feel
[59:01] like the Bitcoin
[59:03] dominance with the stable coins I don't
[59:06] know how much sense this makes because
[59:08] the stable coins are like basically
[59:10] feared if we include fear then then
[59:13] Bitcoin dominance is like at 0.1% or
[59:15] something like that if I don't know I
[59:18] don't know just as if I had never given
[59:21] any importance to it oh yeah it's it's
[59:24] interesting yeah but um it's it's uh if
[59:29] if you look at Bitcoin dominance it's
[59:31] it's like 50 to 60% usually around the
[59:34] time I think right now it's like a 56 or
[59:36] something like that that where I looked
[59:38] the last time and if you exclude the
[59:41] stable coins uh it's it's way more it's
[59:44] like 70 or something like that uh the
[59:47] last time I looked uh it's a while ago
[59:50] but uh yeah it's an interesting attack
[59:52] like I never saw it as an attack Vector
[59:54] it's it's a distraction uh but it is
[59:57] just I think you even on podcast I
[60:00] listen to Especially Yours uh when you
[60:03] do go into YouTube comments uh the first
[60:07] one you see on top is always some scams
[60:09] right why is that yeah yeah uh if you if
[60:14] you want to get the real uh uh positive
[60:18] or negative I mean real feedback about
[60:21] your episode you have to dig a little
[60:24] bit and it's same thing with Bitcoin uh
[60:27] if you want to get to the real thing uh
[60:30] you have to dig uh you have to do some
[60:32] work you have to dig a little bit
[60:34] because um there's a lot of scam there's
[60:36] a lot of noise around it and it's easy
[60:38] to get
[60:40] distracted uh and look uh that's the
[60:43] first time I heard about Bitcoin but
[60:45] then uh when I chose to uh go all in and
[60:49] leave my country but all my wealth in it
[60:52] uh well I I had to really be sure that
[60:57] uh it was worth something and that it
[60:59] was not going to crush so uh I really
[61:04] thought a long time uh should I
[61:07] diversify or
[61:10] not uh cuz uh everybody that's the
[61:14] that's a prevailance strategy you never
[61:17] put everything in one basket all your
[61:21] eggs in one basket you always need to
[61:24] diversify uh but I cool I just as soon
[61:28] as I start looking at other coins I said
[61:31] no that's that's [ __ ] that's uh
[61:34] that's a scam and then the next one that
[61:36] no that's there's a company it's all
[61:38] like that only Bitcoin was the
[61:41] decentralized one uh with no fun no no
[61:45] company and that's what I needed I need
[61:48] a real asset like digital gold something
[61:53] that is not made up by any one it's
[61:56] something that just exists on the
[61:58] internet and it's a it's a part of
[62:01] nature now it's part of humanity it's a
[62:03] it's as if it's not an invention it's
[62:05] like we discovered uh wealth we
[62:09] discovered hardest uh we discovered
[62:12] absolute
[62:13] scarcity that's a that's a mathematical
[62:17] truth it's like we discovered a uh a
[62:22] number uh that is hard to find right
[62:26] it's something um we we we still can
[62:30] forget it but what I mean is it's not
[62:32] something anybody can
[62:34] own it's not do the Bitcoin by itself do
[62:38] not belong to any country or company or
[62:40] whatever and that's
[62:41] one one of the thing that makes it
[62:44] special that's that's really really true
[62:47] and I like also that you looked into
[62:49] real estate first I feel like a lot of
[62:51] bitcoiners the more dig uh like thought
[62:55] about real real estate or actually did
[62:57] Real Estate uh or was in in the ways to
[63:00] get to be in real estate um what was the
[63:03] final thing for you to to not do real
[63:06] estate like why why for the people that
[63:08] are still playing with the photo I have
[63:10] some Bitcoin but I also want to do real
[63:12] estate um why why not that and also um
[63:16] do you recommend I mean it's a personal
[63:18] situation always but do you recommend um
[63:21] renting or buying your own house because
[63:24] that's that's also kind of a real estate
[63:25] property that you okay uh I I I do not
[63:28] recommend anything because uh every
[63:31] every person situation is different um
[63:36] and even me uh when I'm talking about
[63:38] real estate I I never wanted to gamble
[63:41] uh or in invest or play with stocks
[63:46] because it's that money represents my my
[63:49] work my time my my time on Earth I don't
[63:53] want to gamble with it and play with it
[63:56] and uh I did not invest in real estate I
[63:59] was just led to it because I was already
[64:02] looking for a harder
[64:04] money uh I wanted to just save my money
[64:08] not invest and what I thought was that
[64:12] real estate was the way to do it and I
[64:14] wanted to own my place and uh and that's
[64:19] it but I did not think I I did not want
[64:22] to uh make profit from it I did not I
[64:25] never so it on his
[64:26] investment and it's the same thing with
[64:28] Bitcoin Bitcoin does a better job at
[64:31] that than anything else so when I got
[64:34] into Bitcoin uh when I discovered
[64:37] Bitcoin uh then you see
[64:41] I I was very close to uh to to sell
[64:46] everything I own and move out of the
[64:48] country because I was already
[64:49] disappointed in everything else so I was
[64:52] only a small step away from uh selling
[64:56] my my my condo to put everything in
[64:59] Bitcoin and move abroad and I think most
[65:02] people are still not in that situation
[65:05] so that's why I don't recommend anything
[65:07] to anyone some people have families uh
[65:11] some people live in the countryside in
[65:12] the city look Some people prefer to rent
[65:15] some people need to move often Some
[65:18] people prefer to settle in one place for
[65:20] a long time everybody's situation is
[65:22] different but uh if you want to save
[65:25] youry there is nothing better than
[65:27] Bitcoin there is no second bet that's
[65:29] what I was say one more thing um with
[65:33] about stacking Bitcoin because I feel
[65:35] like I had one of my like the first 10
[65:38] podcast I think he was on and and and he
[65:41] said like it's it's really hard for him
[65:43] he was also Anonymous here and and
[65:46] because he was an early bitcoiner so he
[65:48] had a big stack and he was like it's
[65:51] hard for him to stack because his
[65:54] Bitcoin net worth uh
[65:57] was uh so big and Bitcoin then grew so
[66:01] fast that even when he drops his whole
[66:04] income in Bitcoin it it doesn't make a
[66:06] huge stent in the in the whole thing
[66:08] it's like a drop in the bucket uh so
[66:11] with all the the the early Bitcoin ogs
[66:15] I'm always um and OG's is like a weird
[66:19] word because when are you an OG I feel
[66:22] like when you are entering in 24 20 24
[66:25] you're still still kind of an OG because
[66:27] we quite early but uh there there are no
[66:30] rules to do that but as you are early in
[66:32] Bitcoin um how how how do you keep
[66:36] stacking uh even though the the income
[66:39] doesn't grow in the same level that your
[66:43] your your stack grows over time I mean
[66:46] how do I keep stacking it's it's
[66:49] interesting for me because when you have
[66:52] uh let's say you have like uh like let's
[66:55] say 100 units uh of of your uh um stack
[67:00] is is uh in Bitcoin whatever the unit is
[67:04] and then you can add
[67:06] 0.001 um% of that in uh in your Bitcoin
[67:13] stack is it is it hard is like do you
[67:16] ever consider selling some Bitcoin or do
[67:19] you ever was like oh I I stacked enough
[67:21] now I can like uh just just waste my
[67:24] money or just suspended because it
[67:27] doesn't make a huge difference when you
[67:29] uh do the small income to like a huge
[67:32] portion of of your uh Bitcoin because I
[67:36] also see it in in in my um years like
[67:39] over over the years um the the
[67:43] accumulation pace of of my Bitcoin
[67:45] slowed down because the Bitcoin price
[67:47] just went up uh so it's sometimes I'm
[67:51] wondering like if you do stacking long
[67:56] enough at some point are you stopping
[67:58] stacking are you spending more because
[68:01] you're like oh I have a a huge safety
[68:03] that with Bitcoin already uh and and
[68:06] keep stacking on do you get where I'm
[68:08] going with this yeah yeah I see um yeah
[68:11] because it measured in sets uh when you
[68:15] use Bitcoin as the unit of account uh if
[68:18] it's a def the def deflationary money
[68:23] then yeah the amount of STS you're going
[68:26] to save and stack uh is going to slow
[68:30] down over time when the value is going
[68:34] up um yeah
[68:36] so uh when you look back you could say
[68:40] yeah sure uh look at those Bitcoin ogs
[68:42] they got those huge Stacks with very
[68:46] little effort while I have to work hard
[68:49] to stack for to to to to be uh able to
[68:54] stack very little amount right but um I
[68:59] say two things first is that uh that's
[69:04] how the bit that's why Bitcoin is
[69:07] successful that's how Bitcoin will take
[69:10] over the Fiat system because
[69:15] the the the network effect of the Fiat
[69:20] system is so strong that to be able to
[69:25] overcome it another monetary system must
[69:31] be order of magnitudes better than
[69:35] it 100 time 1,000 time 10,000 times
[69:38] better than it whatever number like if
[69:41] if it's even
[69:43] measurable but I mean uh being only a
[69:47] little bit better than Fiat is not
[69:49] enough we need to be
[69:52] overwhelmingly better than Fiat to be
[69:55] able to beat it to grow faster than it
[69:58] and eventually replace it and be the
[70:02] world's Reserve currency and the world U
[70:07] trading um the the media the world's
[70:11] medium of exchange on higher higher Li
[70:16] layers right so in order to beat the
[70:20] Fiat system um the incentive to adopted
[70:26] early must be high and that's what the
[70:31] OG did uh the the people who who had the
[70:36] foresight to see where the future what
[70:40] kind of future was better and who Bet On
[70:44] It must be very well
[70:48] rewarded right and the price of uh
[70:53] adopting it later will be high compared
[70:57] to that the second thing is
[71:01] that uh it's compared to the ogs right
[71:05] to the early adopters that's when we
[71:07] look back in the past but a deflationary
[71:13] monetary Network what it does is that it
[71:17] increase in value so you should look in
[71:20] the future right so you're instead of
[71:24] looking at those people who adopted
[71:27] early in the past how they got it better
[71:30] well look at yourself look at how early
[71:33] you are compared to uh Bitcoin as a as a
[71:40] world Reserve currency adopted by
[71:43] countries as a as a monetary Network for
[71:47] the whole of humanity when we'll use
[71:51] Bitcoin in the solar
[71:53] system when it's not even only uh money
[71:58] for Humanity now but also for all future
[72:04] Generations so instead of looking 15
[72:07] years in the past why not look a
[72:10] thousand years in the
[72:12] future look how early we are now right
[72:15] so yeah uh it's hard to stack a few St a
[72:20] few sets now but what what is a few a
[72:25] few sets now is not going to be a few in
[72:27] the future right right if it's
[72:30] successful it's going to be worth a lot
[72:33] and the um the expectancy of value
[72:37] compared to the risk the the it has
[72:41] almost no chance it fails and quite High
[72:44] chance it's
[72:47] successful uh in the worst case you lose
[72:50] what you put into it in the best case
[72:53] that will be life-changing money
[72:56] then yeah the incentive is there why not
[72:59] put a little bit into it I think that's
[73:01] that's a that's a great Insight uh
[73:04] because when we look in the past uh it's
[73:08] like easy to say like oh it's it's
[73:10] unfair oh oh no no like it's it's I
[73:14] could have done that but you did not so
[73:16] like it's fair so like that's that's
[73:19] that's a ego thing that everyone in
[73:21] Bitcoin kind of has to go through even
[73:24] someone that came in
[73:26] 2015 I saw people coming in 2011 were
[73:30] like oh [ __ ] no no they they were they
[73:32] were so early How Can I stack as many
[73:34] sets as as they but yeah even like
[73:37] Michael se he came in 2020 and he
[73:39] achieved a lot uh in stacking imagine
[73:43] him getting in get getting earlier in
[73:46] like two three four years earlier he
[73:48] would have had like a million Bitcoin or
[73:50] something like that so it all it all
[73:52] works out in the end I feel like
[73:55] everyone gets the the price they deserve
[73:56] and I myself is like I I got also in in
[74:00] 2020 but I first saw it and little bit
[74:03] researched about it in
[74:04] 2017 but I was too arrogant uh to
[74:08] understand it that that's all like I was
[74:10] just too lazy and arrogant to really
[74:12] research about it otherwise uh I could
[74:14] have accumulated way more uh so I had to
[74:17] pay the higher price in in 2020 and I
[74:20] think that's an it's an ego thing that
[74:22] we we have to step over and it's it's
[74:25] great how you how you described it one
[74:27] last topic that I want to touch on and
[74:29] we already very long with the time I
[74:32] hope I hope you have still a few minutes
[74:33] time is is that all right no problem no
[74:36] problem well it's early night for me no
[74:38] problem um when we talk about Bitcoin uh
[74:43] I always like to also talk about freedom
[74:45] and how we do it in the in in in the
[74:48] future and I think you are a unique
[74:50] perspective because you moved out of
[74:51] your country
[74:53] um H how free do you consider yourself
[74:56] to be and what steps are you taking to
[74:59] enhance that freedom or to protect the
[75:02] freedom that you already yeah uh yeah as
[75:05] I told you my yeah my step to move out
[75:07] of Canada first uh but once that move
[75:10] was made uh the the PA was not easy uh
[75:14] look I really struggled in the last five
[75:16] years uh here because I uh I I needed to
[75:22] keep a job as a foreign worker in uh in
[75:26] my new place um and uh you know it's
[75:31] it's not it's not a job what that I
[75:33] studied for necessarily uh foreigners do
[75:38] not have a good um good always have a
[75:42] good situation uh I mean migrants
[75:46] workers uh legal legal migrants worker
[75:49] to not have the best economic situation
[75:53] so even with uh with with a quite low
[75:57] income uh I chose no I'm not going to u
[76:01] to to to sell my sets and because of the
[76:05] price increase I realized yeah look uh
[76:08] you your question is how did it increase
[76:11] my freedom I'm coming to it the the fact
[76:14] that I hold my wealth in Bitcoin uh made
[76:17] me more confident that uh whatever
[76:20] happens to me whatever [ __ ] happens uh
[76:23] if I lose a job uh if I have to move for
[76:26] some time whatever [ __ ] happens I'm
[76:29] going to be fine because my money is not
[76:32] stuck at a bank it's not stuck in the
[76:34] real estate it's it's here with me I I
[76:38] own my stuff even if my device breaks I
[76:42] still have my 12 words okay so it gave
[76:47] me a a piece of mind that I never had
[76:53] before because before I was always
[76:56] running trying
[76:59] to catch up with the hamster wheel I
[77:02] need to get into real estate as fast as
[77:04] possible else I'm going to be stuck in
[77:06] slavery
[77:07] forever uh I I don't have those worries
[77:10] anymore with Bitcoin I know I'm going to
[77:12] be fine and I can focus my mind on other
[77:19] greater things and uh appreciate the
[77:22] beauty of life
[77:25] I it doesn't mean I don't struggle I
[77:26] mean look in the last five years I I
[77:29] work hard and I uh I did a lot of
[77:33] paperwork to get everything in order but
[77:37] uh I know also that most of it is behind
[77:41] me now already even if it's not
[77:43] completely in order yet um most of it is
[77:47] behind me and I can start seeing the
[77:51] beauty around me again and that's a
[77:55] great thing because that's something in
[77:58] my early adult uh adulthood since I had
[78:01] started working since I was always
[78:03] stressed out about saving myself from
[78:07] from from some from some [ __ ] from some
[78:10] danger I I had forgotten it
[78:14] how life is beautiful around us right
[78:17] that's something we can appreciate when
[78:19] we grew up as a teenager when we start
[78:22] uh leave school and start traveling a
[78:25] little bit seeing out the world and then
[78:28] we start working and it uh kind of
[78:31] forget it well I could start seeing that
[78:34] again and that's something that is uh
[78:38] it's enabled by Bitcoin uh absolutely
[78:40] because uh I don't see uh I don't see
[78:43] most people who do not own Bitcoin uh
[78:47] appreciate life as much
[78:50] serious and you get that that s uh with
[78:55] Bitcoin I I got it today as a podcast as
[78:58] a comment on the podcast if uh that
[79:00] someone said like the longer someone is
[79:02] in Bitcoin it feels like the the more
[79:04] send they have in life uh like you you
[79:08] you you stop giving [ __ ] about what
[79:12] other people are doing and and you try
[79:14] to focus on on the good things in life
[79:17] and you try to focus really on on the
[79:18] things in front of you uh it's it's an
[79:21] interesting thing that I also discovered
[79:24] with Bitcoin that are on the podcast
[79:26] with bitcoiners that are a little bit
[79:27] newer to the game with bitcoiners that
[79:29] are a little bit longer to the game so
[79:31] it's it's interesting to see
[79:34] that uh param of needs right you at the
[79:39] basis you need yeah uh to to be to to
[79:42] have air to breathe and then to have
[79:45] food and then physical safety well it
[79:49] seems that before the my economic safety
[79:53] was the the the place in the ladder
[79:56] where like I was kind of stuck and uh I
[80:00] I couldn't see a way to to get above it
[80:04] and since I got Bitcoin I know that uh I
[80:09] I
[80:10] can uh I can I can push forward I can
[80:13] achieve Higher Goals after that very
[80:16] true I love that um last question for
[80:19] the entertain that I now ask all my
[80:21] guests what can we learn from you
[80:25] besides Bitcoin and moving beside
[80:28] Bitcoin and moving from countries from
[80:31] my old country what can we learn from me
[80:34] yeah uh beside good
[80:37] question
[80:39] um it Bitcoin is part of it but it's not
[80:43] uh it's not the same thing uh I think uh
[80:48] I I told you at the beginning of the
[80:50] podcast that I'm a big fan of
[80:53] decentralized identi ities separate
[80:57] identities uh when you ask me about why
[80:59] I stay Anonymous in your
[81:02] podcast
[81:04] uh I do want to control my money control
[81:09] my Bitcoin but I do I'm a big fan of
[81:13] controlling my data and that's something
[81:17] uh I think people give away very easily
[81:21] by kyy seeing themselves to goods and to
[81:25] to services to bitcoin exchanges but not
[81:29] only that to every every online service
[81:31] you have to qic yourself to to use it
[81:36] and I think people do not value their
[81:39] data enough uh because that's a it's not
[81:44] a currency it's not you data is not a
[81:47] currency use as to to exchange but it
[81:51] has a lot of value especially in uh uh
[81:56] with AI and look I study statistics I
[81:59] use data I I can make use of it uh and
[82:05] yeah people do not value it enough and
[82:08] what happens when you give your your
[82:10] phone knows everything you do and
[82:12] everywhere you go and yeah everything
[82:15] you do uh they end up knowing you better
[82:19] than you know
[82:20] yourself and they can predict what you
[82:22] do better than you can predict it
[82:24] yourself and that's um that's something
[82:28] very valuable that's something I do in
[82:30] my own life and that's one reason why I
[82:32] got into Bitcoin because I can control
[82:34] my own money but before that uh
[82:37] fundamentally it's about controlling my
[82:39] own information and protecting my
[82:43] privacy so that's something I do in my
[82:47] own life about everything I keep track
[82:50] of a lot of things and I do not share it
[82:52] with any uh with lots of
[82:55] services so that's my answer that's a
[82:59] very valuable uh answer I think we have
[83:01] to be more Weare especially with big
[83:03] Tech and everything going on um thank
[83:07] you for for that inside um uh we have
[83:10] now the endro tetin where the previous
[83:12] guest is asking a question for the next
[83:14] guest uh without knowing who the next
[83:16] guest actually is and your question from
[83:18] the previous guest is what was the
[83:21] single article or book that orange build
[83:24] you the most the single one there are
[83:26] many but if I need to say one mhm uh it
[83:31] will be 1984 of George
[83:34] Orwell oh that's an interesting choice
[83:36] yeah that that's a big one yeah yeah
[83:39] yeah it's it's about totalitarianism and
[83:42] that's about how low things can go uh
[83:46] how bad things can go if we do not uh
[83:50] care about about care enough about our
[83:53] freedom so under this
[83:56] under understanding that message uh
[84:00] unlocked in my mind uh the importance of
[84:04] freedom and led me to the discovery of
[84:07] Bitcoin
[84:09] amazing really really cool uh perfect
