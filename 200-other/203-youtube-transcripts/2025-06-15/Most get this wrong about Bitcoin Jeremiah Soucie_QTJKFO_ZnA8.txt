[00:00] try to go and get $220,000 out of a bank
[00:02] account where to be honest it was quite
[00:04] horrible if you get on the wrong side of
[00:05] the government your ability to transact
[00:07] can to be shut down are they dying off
[00:11] probably what do you think is the
[00:12] biggest misconception in your friend and
[00:15] family Circle about Bitcoin um I think
[00:19] misconception I think it starts with
[00:21] just even before the misconception part
[00:25] uh is that um they just not looking at
[00:31] it through a different
[00:33] Paradigm all right and I know we talk
[00:36] about this being a paradigm shift
[00:38] but I think looking at it through any
[00:41] conventional
[00:43] lens um generates
[00:45] automatically uh Mis misconceptions
[00:49] about what it
[00:51] is um I think that you know we we've
[00:56] seen 15 years of History we know that it
[00:59] has gone from you know an idea to you
[01:02] know the current current state yet only
[01:05] a very small percentage of the planet uh
[01:09] has any material uh allocation to
[01:13] bitcoin um and and so you know the the
[01:18] numbers I think we we all are well aware
[01:21] of uh that of people who've actually um
[01:25] bought more than $100 on
[01:28] coinbase uh is very very
[01:31] small um so I think honestly the
[01:37] misconceptions that exist really dig
[01:40] into kind of that fundamental big
[01:42] question uh is kind of what is what is
[01:45] money and I think that without
[01:48] acknowledging that um everything that
[01:52] you know uh
[01:54] people uh believe or or think about it
[01:58] uh is through a lens
[02:00] that that in I would say is quite
[02:02] distorted because they're they're
[02:04] looking at it through that conventional
[02:05] lens and they're not to be honest even
[02:08] seeing it as a new form of money um you
[02:12] know it's like that
[02:14] uh uh the meme where there's two little
[02:18] fish swimming around and the big fish
[02:20] kind of goes by and uh kind of says
[02:23] how's the water boys and they're like
[02:25] you know what water right and it's like
[02:28] when right
[02:31] uh so when we when we sort of
[02:33] examine uh Bitcoin within that you
[02:37] know within the the lens of sort of our
[02:40] our existing government Fiat based
[02:43] currencies um it's kind of like that
[02:46] it's like what what water and so um I
[02:50] mean I could give you some of the easy
[02:52] ones you know um but at the end of the
[02:55] day I really think you know to keep it
[02:59] you know very hot level it's just like
[03:00] people people are missing that
[03:02] fundamental
[03:03] question and so not a lot of people get
[03:08] Bitcoin or have a really material amount
[03:11] right now in Bitcoin um what brought you
[03:15] to bitcoin like why did you discover it
[03:18] what uh made you think about the water
[03:23] and notice the water around you yeah
[03:26] well sort of keeping with that same you
[03:29] know uh paradigm shift and what is money
[03:33] um like everyone you know I remember
[03:36] back in I believe 2011 when you know the
[03:39] winlos twins bought enormous amount of
[03:44] Bitcoin like I I I remember that being
[03:47] one of the first times I uh really like
[03:51] I KNE knew about it but that it was sort
[03:54] of put on my radar as like what why did
[03:56] they just like dump all of their
[03:58] Facebook money into into this thing I
[04:01] didn't at the time do anything about it
[04:04] um and then um we can get into it a
[04:07] little more uh perhaps but um I had a
[04:11] father who's since passed away a few
[04:13] years ago uh he would have been like um
[04:17] 80 I think 83 or 84 um he got Bitcoin
[04:21] well way before me um so back in like
[04:25] 2015
[04:26] 2016 um you know he's mid 70s and and he
[04:29] was trying to get my mother to buy
[04:33] Bitcoin and he didn't even ask me I just
[04:36] it's funny I've looked back into his uh
[04:39] his email that we still have and there's
[04:41] all these like um times where he was
[04:45] trying to figure out how to buy Bitcoin
[04:48] I say that because uh you know we all
[04:50] get Bitcoin when we do and so for me um
[04:56] you know bring it sort of more present
[04:58] moment um
[05:00] I in 2019 so just kind of I guess we'll
[05:05] say like a full four years ago now um
[05:08] went through some personal stuff you
[05:10] know um
[05:12] separation and um I I at that time had
[05:16] to kind of go and redo all of my
[05:21] finances right so I'm I'm uh sort of
[05:25] smack dab in Gen X so you know I've been
[05:28] around for a little while and I've I've
[05:29] invested I've bought homes but going
[05:32] through a
[05:33] separation um is something that is a
[05:36] paradigm shift it it requires you to
[05:40] take something that you've been doing
[05:42] for a long time and completely have to
[05:45] look at the world differently you know
[05:48] um and so going through that process
[05:53] um I had to get a new house and or a new
[05:58] place to live
[06:00] and and here's the thing Robin and and
[06:02] this is where I uh this is where my
[06:06] journey truly
[06:07] began um I started looking at property
[06:11] and I had owned a few homes in my life
[06:13] and and had a good amount of equity but
[06:17] I looked back at home
[06:19] prices uh the very first home that I had
[06:22] bought uh and you know the numbers are
[06:26] kind of interesting but it probably was
[06:28] close to 20 years ago when it was
[06:31] $167,500
[06:33] uh for a home um in a in a city here in
[06:38] Canada and uh uh when I started looking
[06:43] at that same home or an equivalent it it
[06:46] was almost three times the um the price
[06:52] in dollars that it was when I bought it
[06:56] except my salary had not changed not not
[07:00] really in a in a 15-year period I mean
[07:02] it had but not not relative to the to
[07:05] the asset uh to that increase in asset
[07:08] price so I started like I kind of had a
[07:13] WTF sort of moment and um and that
[07:16] really just launched this kind of like
[07:19] you know inquiry into I didn't outright
[07:23] start asking the question what is money
[07:25] but that that's that's where it
[07:27] started and
[07:29] uh from from from that sort of
[07:32] initial I guess question uh I first
[07:36] discovered gold to be honest um and I I
[07:41] understood uh what gold was as as money
[07:45] I learned about that and this is uh
[07:48] interestingly all kind of 2019 early
[07:51] 2020 just before kind of the having and
[07:54] the sort of the March uh liquidity event
[07:57] of 2020 um um and as I'm exploring gold
[08:02] and uh you know uh I never ever I can I
[08:06] can say with
[08:08] the uh you know I that I never looked at
[08:12] any of the sort of altcoins whatsoever
[08:15] uh but I like to say that gold was kind
[08:17] of my altcoin um I think there's a place
[08:20] for gold but uh it was what sort of
[08:23] brought me to bitcoin and so in that
[08:26] process of discovering gold what is
[08:28] money
[08:30] um you you you're well aware that uh a
[08:33] lot of a lot of the people in both camps
[08:35] kind of you know co-mingle and so I
[08:38] started um right kind
[08:41] of before the having of 2020 I started
[08:45] to understand like oh there's this this
[08:48] digital version of gold and because I
[08:50] just spent a number of months studying
[08:53] gold when
[08:54] I really started to unpack what Bitcoin
[08:58] was
[08:59] uh it it clicked almost instantly
[09:02] because I had just had this sort of
[09:04] schooling in in in gold and you know
[09:07] precious metals and the scarcity and and
[09:10] stock to flow and all of these things
[09:12] and so when I when I saw what that was
[09:16] um it there there wasn't really a long
[09:20] process and I didn't go and look at all
[09:22] of the other coins or anything I I
[09:24] understood
[09:25] fundamentally that Bitcoin stood on its
[09:28] own as something very unique and very
[09:30] special yeah you I think most bitcoiners
[09:34] right now went through an altcoin
[09:37] shitcoin face in in their in their
[09:40] sphere it's interesting that because you
[09:43] came from gold mindset and gold
[09:46] properties are pretty much the same as
[09:49] Bitcoin just in a digital realm and have
[09:51] some improvements on them um because I
[09:55] came from a a stock mindset I invested
[09:58] in stock stocks a lot I came from this
[10:00] warm Buffet mindset that you have to
[10:02] have a cash flow and that's why I deiss
[10:05] dismissed Bitcoin for a long time even
[10:07] though I knew about it so how was it uh
[10:11] watching Bitcoin from 2011 when you
[10:14] heard of about the um wrinkle of
[10:17] Brothers when 2015 with your father uh
[10:22] and watching it up and down through
[10:25] crazy Cycles uh it's a it's a crazy
[10:29] experience when and you you only bought
[10:32] it then in 2019 18 you
[10:35] said I I would say seriously allocated
[10:38] in
[10:40] 2020 yeah yeah uh but uh I I feel a
[10:44] little bit fortunate that I uh that I
[10:49] discovered it through through a
[10:52] different process and not number go up
[10:54] in in the and even though I remember
[10:56] vividly the the day of the havoc
[10:59] I had no idea what it was I no I mean I
[11:02] did but I just had no clue what was
[11:05] coming so I feel like I had bu built a
[11:08] pretty strong
[11:10] thesis um before the sort of the you
[11:15] know the parabolic sort of runup in the
[11:17] end of 2020 and
[11:20] 2021 um so I feel I feel fortunate for
[11:23] that interesting do you know by the way
[11:26] uh why your father was interested in
[11:28] Bitcoin you went through his emails
[11:30] where there something like why he
[11:32] discovered it why he was so interested
[11:33] in it yeah so good good question and and
[11:37] very very important part of like even to
[11:40] this day like how I think about Bitcoin
[11:42] and and just even even just thinking in
[11:46] general um the man was a a futurist in
[11:50] in his ability to to see the world um
[11:55] he I think saw a lot of things that he
[11:58] wasn't necessarily able to execute on um
[12:01] I grew up him with him talking about uh
[12:05] having invested in gold and
[12:08] silver uh back like late 70s early 80s
[12:13] when precious metals kind of did the
[12:17] Run um you know he didn't really I don't
[12:22] think in any material way like make a
[12:24] lot of money but he understood at some
[12:27] level that the uh
[12:29] that that there was something happened
[12:32] when we came off of gold in 71 but I
[12:35] don't think he really spent the
[12:37] intellectual sort of Deep dive into into
[12:40] why but at on a level he knew things
[12:43] were were
[12:44] broken and
[12:46] so coupled with that he always just saw
[12:49] Trends and and sort of emerging ideas
[12:53] way before uh way before most people and
[12:58] so there was a combination of things
[13:00] there was the technological aspect of it
[13:03] um as well as the monetary element and I
[13:07] think he loved the idea of Technology he
[13:10] was horrible at it um and but he he he
[13:15] loved the idea of of uh emerging Trends
[13:18] and and just like you know I really am
[13:21] kind of sad that he didn't get to kind
[13:23] of see where Bitcoin sort of is now and
[13:26] today that said uh
[13:29] i i i preface that because for me that
[13:32] thinking around money uh even though it
[13:34] was very just like these IDE
[13:36] abstractions around like you know
[13:39] precious metals I so I was primed from a
[13:42] very early young age uh had no idea I'll
[13:46] be very honest had no idea the
[13:48] importance of of of sound money um but
[13:52] at at least I was primed for it and so I
[13:56] will be very honest I don't think I
[13:58] really
[13:59] um you know it was so periphery to to
[14:03] everything else I was doing in life um I
[14:06] don't even really think I had a good
[14:08] appreciation for the the cycles and the
[14:10] price up and down I just had these data
[14:13] points of like you know uh you know I
[14:17] have the obviously Silk Road always
[14:20] sticks out for a lot of like regular
[14:22] people um you know that that was
[14:25] something that was a big a big deal at
[14:28] that time so I have these data points
[14:30] but to be honest Robin I really um I
[14:34] didn't have any opinion whatsoever
[14:37] except until sort of until I I really
[14:39] went sort of deep on
[14:42] it what I would say is that for all of
[14:45] my sort of grown-up life um
[14:50] I I very much was interested in in
[14:52] technology and you know I think it was
[14:55] just uh having grown up sort of in an
[14:57] analog world through the 80s and and 90s
[15:01] uh and transitioning into a digital
[15:03] world so like most of my childhood was
[15:06] very much analog but it was like mid
[15:08] teens and up that I started to see the
[15:11] internet and so you know I I I know
[15:14] we've seen all the statistics of kind of
[15:17] how many people were on the internet in
[15:19] the mid 90s and how many people are on
[15:21] the Bitcoin Network now but I watched a
[15:24] couple waves of
[15:26] technology I watched the just you know
[15:29] all of the web infrastructure of the 90s
[15:32] and and sort of the the the asset bubble
[15:35] that existed around uh the internet of
[15:39] the early uh the early 2000s and then
[15:42] out of that the wake of you know all of
[15:45] the Big Fang stocks that we're aware of
[15:48] and I bought a few stocks and lost a
[15:50] bunch of money and but but really always
[15:53] was fascinated with
[15:55] technology when I saw around the 2010
[15:58] 2011 and the the Fang stocks uh really
[16:02] like the the mobile wave effectively um
[16:06] I I missed that too I kind of was doing
[16:10] so many other things in life and and at
[16:12] the time you know I had a financial
[16:14] advisor that was kind of managing my
[16:16] portfolio so I I really didn't I wasn't
[16:19] looking at you know the stuff I mean
[16:23] personal finance yes but not the
[16:25] investing
[16:26] side and so um when I discovered
[16:31] Bitcoin um I was kind of primed because
[16:34] I I had really kind of missed the the
[16:37] early wave in the 2000s the
[16:40] 2010s and I I was so close you know I
[16:43] mean that's that that really means
[16:46] absolutely nothing but I was very close
[16:47] to buying a lot of like these Fang
[16:49] stocks when they were single digits but
[16:51] I just I don't think I understood how
[16:54] disruptive they were going to be and
[16:57] that they were going to scale into
[16:58] trillion dollar businesses because we
[17:01] just never had that right and the value
[17:03] unlock from the internet
[17:06] um I didn't get
[17:09] it with hindsight being
[17:12] 2020 I told myself I would not miss the
[17:16] next big technological sort of
[17:19] innovation and so I was already primed
[17:22] having missed a couple of them before
[17:25] when I discovered Bitcoin I was like it
[17:27] was kind of you know game over I was
[17:30] like I am not missing this because I see
[17:32] this as as disruptive or more
[17:36] disruptive than the internet was and
[17:41] arguably um on some levels the biggest
[17:45] innovation in human history and I know
[17:47] that's that's a big statement I love
[17:50] that it's a a statement I can definitely
[17:53] get behind um so I heard that you also
[17:57] in Canada so you also heard a lot about
[18:01] the Canadian draa yeah yeah for sure
[18:05] yeah uh yeah I'm I'm I'm in Ontario um
[18:09] yeah I think um you know I look back at
[18:12] sort of that time period sort of macro
[18:15] globally and um what I think is
[18:19] interesting about that just moment in
[18:21] time is
[18:22] that uh within uh I would say 48 hours
[18:28] of uh that event uh the the the Ukraine
[18:35] Russia sort of
[18:36] conflict um and the sanctions that that
[18:39] occurred almost at the same time and um
[18:43] I think from my perspective you know I
[18:47] think in in Canada there was I think a
[18:49] lot of people were um kind of I'll say
[18:53] quite triggered by by kind of what
[18:55] happened uh and certainly um
[18:59] perhaps Miss some of the Nuance of what
[19:02] occurred and and from my perspective I
[19:04] really compare those two events and at
[19:07] the end of the day it was government
[19:09] sanctioning finances and so I think you
[19:13] know for me I try often uh to kind of
[19:18] look through that lens and and help you
[19:22] know explain to people who uh certainly
[19:25] you know there's definitely strong
[19:26] opinions on on what went down sure uh on
[19:29] all on everyone has a strong opinion
[19:32] I'll say that um but I think from my
[19:35] perspective it's and I and I look around
[19:39] the world at at you know there's so many
[19:41] examples I mean the the one where the uh
[19:46] it it happened I think in 2020 Is 2020
[19:49] in Nigeria where the the whole sort of
[19:52] group of protesters mostly women uh were
[19:56] were sanctioned from from their bank
[19:59] accounts um and and Bitcoin became a
[20:02] sort of a viable way to get uh donations
[20:05] through to them so I look around the
[20:07] world at at some of these other
[20:09] situations and at the end of the day um
[20:13] I I just think you know money in our
[20:17] current sort of Paradigm the the
[20:19] government based monies that we that we
[20:21] have um um are really all subject to to
[20:25] sanctions um and uh you know Capital
[20:29] controls and I mean sanctions and
[20:31] capital controls seem seems like sounds
[20:34] a little Draconian but the reality is
[20:36] like you know um try to go and get
[20:40] $20,000 out of a bank account anywhere
[20:43] in sort of North America or or Europe uh
[20:46] without questions right like it's it's
[20:48] think recognizing that uh um the money
[20:53] that we have we put into the banking
[20:55] system once it's in there truly isn't
[20:58] hours and I think that's something I
[21:00] mean I think that's something for most
[21:02] people that they
[21:04] really uh they don't they don't realize
[21:08] and you don't have to look far around
[21:10] the world and I mean even domestically
[21:13] obviously to to see to see that play out
[21:16] and so anyway longwinded to kind of say
[21:18] I I I really take that sort of macro
[21:21] look at it and I think you know a lot of
[21:24] people I'll just to end on this point um
[21:28] I think a lot of people looked at that
[21:30] and um there was the media around it was
[21:35] to be honest it was quite horrible like
[21:38] it it just it it really I don't think uh
[21:42] um yeah I think I
[21:45] think I don't think we really got a good
[21:47] sense you know what happened as
[21:50] Canadians and so um so as a result a lot
[21:54] of people very much uh looked at it um
[21:58] you know somewhat somewhat one-sided and
[22:02] um at the end of the day uh you know
[22:06] these sort of measures can be applied to
[22:08] anyone and I think that I think is was
[22:11] my biggest takehome as and again
[22:13] especially looking at some of these
[22:14] other situations globally that if you
[22:17] get on the wrong side of the government
[22:19] regardless of whether it it doesn't
[22:22] matter it's like the wrong side and and
[22:25] um that you're your sort of ability to
[22:30] transact can be can be shut down I think
[22:33] for me is uh yeah it's pretty pretty big
[22:37] use case for this and it it was also big
[22:40] because before that people thought oh
[22:42] that's a thing that's in North Korea and
[22:45] China and and in some other countries
[22:47] but this does not come to our Western uh
[22:50] civilization but Canada uh I think
[22:53] actually also awakened some people that
[22:57] like oh in Canada they are freezing bank
[23:00] accounts they are taking people's money
[23:03] because they are
[23:04] protesting um so that I think awaken a
[23:09] lot of people in the western uh
[23:12] hemisphere to say oh maybe I have to
[23:16] protect my financial energy better or in
[23:18] another way um speaking about financial
[23:23] energy and how to protect it you said
[23:25] you had a financial adviser before
[23:28] uh and I always wonder when there's a
[23:32] complete Bitcoin standard and you are
[23:34] really good off if you're saving your
[23:36] financial energy uh in Bitcoin and
[23:39] investing is only if you want to take a
[23:42] risk outsize B if you want to uh invest
[23:46] in a company you're truly believing in
[23:48] it because it's like an wow company um
[23:53] will be financial advisors uh something
[23:56] of the the past sorry will will
[23:58] financial advisors be something of the
[24:00] past yes uh when when we have a complete
[24:04] fullon Bitcoin standard of course now
[24:06] there are lot a lot of financial
[24:08] advisors um and they are giving ETF
[24:12] portfolios they're giving allocations
[24:15] they are telling this and that and I
[24:18] always wonder because I basically lift
[24:21] up in that Bitcoin world uh but I've had
[24:25] before stocks but I was really quickly
[24:27] into Bitcoin I'm in Bitcoin since I'm 22
[24:31] years old so it's basically uh since uh
[24:35] when I go on in my life and I'm 30 40 50
[24:40] years old will basically my whole uh
[24:43] entire adult life will be you know on a
[24:46] Bitcoin standard with all in in
[24:49] there will that yeah so yeah very good
[24:52] question Robin I think like and then
[24:54] this is something I spent a lot of time
[24:56] looking at and you know I've been um you
[24:58] know building sort of advisory Service
[25:00] uh to kind of help people look at uh
[25:04] allocating to bitcoin with you know
[25:06] custody Solutions and um just really a
[25:11] wide range of entry points into Bitcoin
[25:13] but also yeah like I said to first and
[25:16] foremost the allocation strategy so you
[25:18] know you've seen the meme where it's
[25:20] like a little pie chart you know it's
[25:21] like divided 20 different ways it's like
[25:24] you know Bitcoin and all of the the
[25:27] little right and I think um when you
[25:30] start to understand uh Bitcoin as a
[25:35] savings technology right I think we're
[25:37] going through the monetization of this
[25:39] new money so at this point we're we're
[25:42] getting you know that sort of upside
[25:45] that sort of asymmetric upside over the
[25:48] next number of years perhaps uh above
[25:52] and beyond what would be say a normal
[25:54] savings
[25:55] rate um but I think if you look at it
[25:58] through more of that lens of of
[26:01] savings um it it kind of you know you
[26:04] start to uh you know you start to look
[26:07] at all of the traditional sort of asset
[26:10] classes that we put money into and these
[26:15] are all things that have been said
[26:16] before but a few things few points that
[26:19] I would I'd like to sort of focus on is
[26:21] is
[26:22] that um we we really
[26:26] um we financialized so so so many
[26:30] different asset classes that um you know
[26:34] when we're talking
[26:37] about investing I I almost use air
[26:40] quotes around that
[26:41] because I I would argue most people do
[26:44] not invest in the stock market uh they
[26:49] save in the stock market right in
[26:52] investing requires you to look at the
[26:55] performance of a company an individual
[26:57] ual you know stock um you know you run
[27:02] all of the sort of financial analysis
[27:05] you know you look at all the ratios
[27:07] that's
[27:08] investing right to buy a a Market Basket
[27:12] of the s&p500 and and a you know a bond
[27:16] portfolio and that's that's really just
[27:19] saving your money in in in the stock
[27:23] market right so you know we know that
[27:26] the S&P 500 you know n whatever it's
[27:30] it's directionally this number but you
[27:32] know 90% of the gains come from the top
[27:34] seven companies right yet people
[27:37] passively
[27:40] allocate incredible DCA incredible
[27:43] amounts of of money into into
[27:47] these these ETF
[27:50] structures um effectively propping up so
[27:54] many so many companies within within
[27:58] you know within that
[28:00] uh within that whatever bucket uh that
[28:03] that probably are you know effectively
[28:05] zombie companies right but what I what I
[28:09] think is important there is that at the
[28:11] end of the day we are just using a lot
[28:13] of these as savings vehicles and we're
[28:16] trying to uh you know beat effectively
[28:22] beat inflation I mean
[28:25] uh looking at it more nuanced it's like
[28:28] you know we have to have our hurdle rate
[28:31] or uh the you know what is what is the
[28:34] number that we need to get over to you
[28:36] know just stay you know stay in place
[28:40] meaning like we're we're we're not
[28:42] getting ahead but we're not getting
[28:44] behind and I mean a lot of numbers get
[28:48] thrown around um but
[28:51] um you know that 7% sort of inflation
[28:56] rate of of kind of the monetary base is
[28:58] is something that you know if you're not
[29:01] you know if you're if you're making 8 n
[29:04] 10% returns in the broad Market you know
[29:08] you're you're just you know in nominal
[29:10] terms your your portfolio goes up but in
[29:13] purchasing terms it's it's probably not
[29:16] uh it's probably not doing doing so
[29:18] great so little bit long-winded but I
[29:23] think what we're going to start to see
[29:25] as as the you know the ability to um put
[29:31] money into
[29:33] savings uh through through Bitcoin um
[29:37] will slowly start to to drain I don't I
[29:41] don't know how how this how how long
[29:43] this will take I mean I think there's a
[29:46] lot of people have got a lot of theories
[29:47] and Frameworks around this but at the
[29:49] end of the day I think what we'll start
[29:51] to see is you know the best money will
[29:54] prevail and this notion of saving versus
[29:59] investing will radically change and to
[30:02] your point uh there will be a point in
[30:06] the in the future where
[30:09] you uh you will there still will be
[30:14] Investments right you will still invest
[30:16] in good quality companies and ideas and
[30:20] people um but you
[30:24] will you know you will have to assess it
[30:26] again hurdle rate of you know what what
[30:29] is your cost of capital um and whatever
[30:33] the
[30:34] future uh appreciation of Bitcoin is you
[30:39] know various numbers into the future
[30:41] kind of you know 10 to
[30:45] 15 uh you're you're going to need a a
[30:49] compounded annual growth rate
[30:51] exceeding uh Bitcoin as just a as as
[30:55] this new you know mon
[30:57] monetary uh this par paradigm shift in
[31:01] monetary
[31:02] saving uh that you can just simply save
[31:05] in this hard form of money um and not
[31:10] really have to worry about that it's
[31:12] going to it's G to it not have sorry not
[31:15] worry that it will that will go down in
[31:17] value but that will continue to
[31:20] appreciate but all of these these
[31:23] investments will will require at at some
[31:26] sort of future State um that you you are
[31:31] going to exceed that sort of cost of
[31:34] capital and and so I think what it will
[31:37] do is it's just GNA you
[31:40] know it's going to incentivize us to to
[31:45] um be more deliberate in our risking
[31:50] Capital right like I think I think we
[31:52] will be more uh intentional with how we
[31:56] deploy uh deploy Capital full full stop
[32:01] because right now I would argue we as a
[32:06] global Society we risk Capital we we are
[32:09] out so far on the risk curve right uh
[32:14] because of all these inflationary
[32:16] effects that in order to not only
[32:20] preserve but to grow our Capital we need
[32:24] to take on a lot of risk and so
[32:28] um we've seen just completely insane
[32:32] things whether it's you
[32:33] know you know just some of the meme
[32:36] stuff out there the meme stocks and and
[32:39] you know just the things that people
[32:40] have done way out on the risk curve but
[32:43] I I would say that even though we can
[32:46] look at it and some of these ideas are
[32:48] kind of crazy it it it speaks to this
[32:50] world where uh people have to uh take on
[32:55] more risk in order to uh to grow to to
[32:58] grow their their savings and so yeah I
[33:02] think we'll end up seeing like just a
[33:04] focus on better good ideas um and and
[33:08] that the the barrier to
[33:13] um deciding to deploy Capital it will be
[33:17] much higher because we'll we'll be
[33:20] assessing it against that Bitcoin hurdle
[33:22] rate I had when I came into investing I
[33:26] had a lot of success with Tesla stock
[33:28] with Apple stock I went with Tesla above
[33:31] the th% gain and uh because of that
[33:37] people in my family and friend Circle
[33:40] came up to me and asked me what I did
[33:42] because they also want to protect
[33:44] themselves from
[33:46] losing uh Financial energy they want to
[33:50] to flee inflation they wanted to gain
[33:53] also something and I always tried to
[33:58] explain to them what I did I did
[34:01] actually uh investing work I researched
[34:05] about companies I listened to the
[34:07] quarterly calls I I read the 10ks I read
[34:11] the 10 cues I was really deep into a
[34:13] company I had so much knowledge about uh
[34:17] Tesla uh I once met a Tesla employee and
[34:21] he was he was shocked how much better on
[34:25] some part of the company I knew the
[34:26] company then himself as employee and I
[34:31] realized afterwards that I tried to put
[34:35] people that just wanted to save money
[34:38] into the investing category and with
[34:42] with with uh Bitcoin I realized that
[34:45] saving should be easy there should be an
[34:48] an vehicle where people can just like
[34:51] okay this savings rate I just put in
[34:54] there and if I want to invest I put in
[34:57] the time I really re research about it
[34:59] and there is the value also then created
[35:02] when you really spend the time and
[35:05] really try to find the the better um
[35:09] stocks and this is where my question was
[35:11] going because when we are on a Bitcoin
[35:13] standard and Bitcoin is a sound money a
[35:18] lot of companies will have a negative
[35:20] grow against Bitcoin because they're not
[35:23] doing well only the companies that are
[35:25] really good uh ining new customers
[35:29] growing doing new technology they will
[35:31] outperform
[35:32] Bitcoin uh when we are on a complete
[35:35] Bitcoin standard I'm talking uh so this
[35:39] will I think drastically change the
[35:41] whole financial advice and financial uh
[35:46] Market uh completely and will um make it
[35:51] a way higher profession being a
[35:54] financial advisor and maybe because now
[35:58] you're having a bank employee who gets
[36:02] like some courses and then he's your
[36:04] financial advisor and uh says oh this
[36:07] ATF and this one so this is this is what
[36:10] I meant with financial advisor will
[36:14] uh are they dying off because of that
[36:19] yeah and and Robin I would I would just
[36:22] uh I would also add you know if if we
[36:25] look at some of the disruption of you
[36:27] know the internet right where you know
[36:30] we can look at Blockbuster and Netflix
[36:32] and Kodak and the digital camera and
[36:35] there's a so many so many examples uh I
[36:39] think when we look at through the things
[36:42] that Bitcoin potentially will
[36:45] disintermediate and impact sort of
[36:48] Legacy um you
[36:51] know entire Fields uh professions uh
[36:55] Industries
[36:57] um I think you are correct I think there
[37:00] will be uh a big radical
[37:03] change um we won't I don't think need as
[37:06] many
[37:07] financial advisors uh around creating
[37:12] elaborate portfolio
[37:14] construction um I think you know it'll
[37:17] be a long time before that doesn't exist
[37:21] that's I don't I don't think
[37:22] directionally that's where we're headed
[37:24] but I think the that notion of needing
[37:28] someone
[37:29] else to offload that risk
[37:33] management right so if we don't have to
[37:38] if we don't have to have if we don't
[37:40] have to accept or take as much risk then
[37:43] and and and and that's why you know
[37:46] arguably most people have a financial
[37:48] advisor is is to have a professional and
[37:52] they are and and and they can create
[37:54] elaborate risk models around you know
[37:56] know all of your goals and and you know
[38:00] uh just how you want to allocate your
[38:03] your Capital based on where you're at in
[38:05] life all those things um I think
[38:07] important but if we're able to drisk the
[38:10] entire sort of uh Financial world with a
[38:15] new monetary standard um I would argue
[38:18] that they're they're they're going to
[38:21] play less of a role in uh advising
[38:25] specific products and probably more
[38:27] around the planning part I think
[38:30] financial planning it will still still
[38:34] exist on a Bitcoin standard um but that
[38:38] idea of offloading risk management to
[38:40] someone else I think will absolutely
[38:43] change and uh you said also um servicing
[38:49] and helping people on the self- custody
[38:52] side I think this we absolutely need
[38:54] there I I see see it every time I go on
[38:59] with
[39:00] my um relatives with people on my
[39:03] friends CLE don't know about Bitcoin and
[39:06] they try to get in they need a lot of
[39:10] advising a lot of teaching a lot of
[39:11] Education in the begin because they
[39:14] never dealt with um cryptographic
[39:18] technology they never dealt with keeping
[39:20] their own keys they think it's just a
[39:23] password they can reset somewhere
[39:26] because they have an email like the this
[39:30] whole idea is completely new but email
[39:34] also was new at some point having having
[39:37] an account somewhere was also new like
[39:39] we have to uh we have to do a lot of
[39:44] Education uh in the next I think let's
[39:47] say five 10 maybe even 20 30 years yeah
[39:51] I
[39:52] agree yeah um where do you fall on the
[39:56] the Privacy side of Bitcoin there are a
[39:58] lot of bitcoiners that say I only try
[40:01] buy P2P only P2P uh I don't want any kyc
[40:06] there's some okay light kyc is okay like
[40:09] relay 21 Bitcoin comes to my
[40:11] mind okay um there are even some
[40:14] exchanges I was on one of these
[40:17] exchanges I'm no longer on there since a
[40:19] long time I'm really glad they asked me
[40:21] where my money was coming from and uh
[40:26] they asked me for proof uh uh that I
[40:30] where it's coming from it's uh that was
[40:33] way too much for me and then I is the
[40:35] longer I in Bitcoin the more and more I
[40:38] move move away from KC and more and more
[40:40] do the P2P uh peer-to-peer uh
[40:45] Market good question Robin I I think um
[40:50] you know I've been listening I'm sure as
[40:52] we all have to like a lot of the uh you
[40:55] know commentary on the upcoming you know
[40:58] ETFs that are that are coming to the to
[41:01] the US markets in the next short while
[41:06] right um and we know that those ETFs are
[41:10] going to absorb an incredible amount of
[41:12] Bitcoin that uh there will be
[41:16] um
[41:18] uh enormous pools of capital I I think
[41:22] sometimes we you know we we we don't
[41:26] realize just like how significant those
[41:29] will
[41:30] be um and I would argue for a lot of
[41:34] people out there um they're
[41:37] probably um it's probably where they're
[41:40] going to allocate capital I think we
[41:42] have to be just outright honest with
[41:45] that um Canada's had access to ETFs
[41:49] bought ETFs we had the first in the
[41:50] world we've had them for a couple of
[41:52] years and I think for a lot of people
[41:55] there's advantages
[41:57] now what I would then say is the
[42:01] importance of having a money that we
[42:04] control that we can hold a bare
[42:09] asset um is something
[42:12] that in a digital form is this is a
[42:16] first in in human history all right and
[42:21] and for all of the early adopters that
[42:24] have you know come along and you know we
[42:27] know how many coins are are missing or
[42:30] lost uh we know how much has been held
[42:35] by long-term holders we know those
[42:37] numbers just keeps going up and up we
[42:40] know that uh you know exchange balances
[42:43] are draining just as we head towards
[42:45] having and all of the the macro
[42:49] catalysts uh including the ETF I say
[42:53] that because I think it's super it's
[42:56] super important for uh those that
[43:00] currently hold Bitcoin you know in in a
[43:05] in a self-sovereign you know Cold
[43:07] Storage you know uh
[43:10] way to really
[43:12] provide um you know
[43:16] education especially as we go through
[43:19] the adoption of these these ETFs and and
[43:21] just the pools of capital that will be
[43:24] unlocked um I think it's just super
[43:26] super critical that that we remain very
[43:31] sort of on
[43:33] the focus of of of uh making sure people
[43:38] understand the differences the reality
[43:42] is uh the vast majority of
[43:45] people are going to
[43:48] probably utilize Bitcoin in some uh you
[43:54] know they they will not interact on the
[43:56] base chain they just most people will
[43:58] not um but I think that makes it all the
[44:02] more important to really for those that
[44:05] have invested the time understanding the
[44:07] importance of securing your your digital
[44:10] gold bars on the base chain uh that we
[44:14] sort of remain very committed to kind of
[44:17] keeping as much of the the
[44:20] network uh in sort of uh private hands
[44:25] keys managed you know uh offchain uh in
[44:29] in in in Cold Storage um because we know
[44:33] that places like you know black rock and
[44:36] all of the other ETF providers and those
[44:38] are just the us- based ones there will
[44:39] be more and more around the world and
[44:41] there will be more sort of institutional
[44:44] custody um that will continue to uh you
[44:48] know
[44:49] absorb um existing Bitcoin um and and so
[44:56] I I I know it's not exactly exactly what
[44:59] you the question that you asked but um I
[45:03] think that this idea of of um privacy is
[45:08] extremely nuanced and I think there's an
[45:11] an incredible need and and perhaps it's
[45:15] more um more
[45:18] relevant uh in other other parts of the
[45:21] world uh right
[45:24] now um
[45:26] but I
[45:28] think I think as a as a you know
[45:30] bitcoiner in in sort of the western role
[45:33] like we we are we do have a lot of
[45:34] financial
[45:36] privilege
[45:37] um but I also think that you know
[45:42] equivalently good to sleep with one eye
[45:43] open as well I think from my standpoint
[45:46] just to sort of sum that up a bit um we
[45:51] we really need to uh be aware that uh
[45:57] uh that you know there is a we're at the
[46:02] they're going to fight us stage um of
[46:04] this sort of what call it of this
[46:06] revolution
[46:08] maintain uh all of the elements of
[46:10] privacy and build the tools in the
[46:12] infrastructure to support that um I
[46:15] think super important
[46:19] um yeah I think it's super important I I
[46:21] know that's sort of longwinded in a few
[46:24] different directions but but I see this
[46:26] sort
[46:28] of almost this competing tension and the
[46:31] importance that bitcoiners really need
[46:33] to kind of stay focused and Vigilant on
[46:37] these tools recognizing that the vast
[46:39] majority of people will not and so
[46:42] continued education and but also
[46:45] internally continued just like uh
[46:48] recognition of how important it is to to
[46:52] to maintain some of those kind of levels
[46:55] of privacy even though I I think the
[46:58] vast majority of people
[47:00] unfortunately um aren are probably going
[47:03] to don't I don't think they will adopt
[47:05] some of these these important parts of
[47:08] Bitcoin and that and I think it's sad
[47:10] but I also think it's probably the
[47:12] reality but
[47:14] also it it also is just the importance
[47:17] that we need to F continue to focus on
[47:20] it is it dangerous for Bitcoin if uh too
[47:24] many people don't realize those
[47:27] tools um yeah I I I mean I I honestly
[47:32] you know I think no yes and no I think
[47:35] it's it's I think I think having these
[47:37] conversations and being sort of
[47:38] challenging like uh sort of all of the
[47:41] sort the what if scenarios as this thing
[47:43] keeps growing uh is important um I just
[47:47] think it's Unstoppable at this point it
[47:49] doesn't mean it can't be slowed down uh
[47:51] or in certain jurisdictions like you
[47:54] know uh somewhat neutered a little bit
[47:57] but I mean the internet exists in every
[47:59] single jurisdiction in the world and
[48:01] we're at that point where I don't think
[48:03] it can be stopped but that doesn't mean
[48:05] that we should take for
[48:07] granted um
[48:09] anything at all at this point because
[48:12] even though it it is a very distributed
[48:15] Network um I think my for me the
[48:20] consolation is that the early adopters
[48:23] at this point um I mean we we know what
[48:26] the the long-term holding rates are
[48:28] right now through like the last 24
[48:32] months all the way down to 15 and a half
[48:34] thousand it didn't didn't change and I I
[48:37] firmly believe that there is a a very
[48:41] material part of the Bitcoin Network
[48:43] that will never it it is going to remain
[48:47] in Cold Storage um and I just think as I
[48:50] said earlier the importance
[48:53] of um you know
[48:56] that holder base that long-term holder
[48:59] base almost as a a contra to the the
[49:04] institutional capture and I don't say
[49:06] capture in a negative way but it's just
[49:09] the reality of perhaps what's coming um
[49:12] for us to just really hold as much as
[49:16] possible interestingly it's like you
[49:18] know I I recently watched uh the Dan
[49:21] Brown uh The Da Vinci Code and uh if uh
[49:26] you know they had the priority of Scion
[49:27] where you know sort of The Keeper of the
[49:29] bloodline is in in a way it's like it
[49:32] feels a little bit like that where we um
[49:36] you know for the for the holders that
[49:39] have embraced you know self custody and
[49:44] Umi all all the various privacy tools
[49:47] that sort of come with that um that it's
[49:50] that it's it's like we're we're we're
[49:52] protecting the network and running our
[49:54] nodes and all of the all of all of those
[49:57] things but but I think it's it's
[49:59] something important that we need to um
[50:02] not forget um that uh there is you know
[50:08] we're you know there's a there's an
[50:10] expression you know the Golden Rule uh
[50:12] you know he who has all the gold makes
[50:14] all the rules and we've seen that play
[50:16] out for for millenn for thousands of
[50:19] years right and this in the first time
[50:23] in I would argue human history just
[50:25] completely changes that um that end and
[50:31] so when you
[50:33] have uh decentralized monetary Network
[50:37] that is outside of the control of you
[50:41] know the rul makers um they are going to
[50:44] do everything in their sort of power to
[50:49] uh to exact control sort of over that
[50:52] because they have for all of human
[50:54] history right so this time will be no
[50:57] different and so I just think um just a
[51:02] important you know message to to all
[51:05] bitcoiners who hold you know Cold
[51:08] Storage Bitcoin is that it you know it's
[51:11] it's if it comes out of cold storage and
[51:13] and I'm not suggesting we shouldn't use
[51:15] it or sell or you know I mean that's
[51:19] what it that's what it's about it's I
[51:21] know I I I think um but but I also think
[51:24] it's recog izing that um I think enough
[51:29] of us realize that keeping it um
[51:33] protected in cold storage for for the
[51:36] for the long term is uh is just super
[51:40] super important and critical to uh yeah
[51:44] to the to the network and that sort of
[51:47] balance of of uh how much Bitcoin will
[51:50] probably end up within these regulated
[51:53] Structured Products
[51:55] no that's a that's a great it's a great
[51:58] great Point um we are already far
[52:03] aheading our podcast so I will come now
[52:05] to our uh end rtin already uh if you saw
[52:09] the podcast before you know that the
[52:11] previous guest asked a question for the
[52:14] next guest um my previous guest was
[52:17] actually on I think two hours ago
[52:21] so quite before that that podcast and he
[52:25] had the question for you uh why Bitcoin
[52:29] but explain it to me like I'm a
[52:34] 5-year-old yeah well I have a
[52:36] nine-year-old and so has been around
[52:40] since you know really much since since
[52:43] since they were five um and uh around
[52:47] that time Robin I got my kids I have now
[52:50] a nine and a 13-year-old but so at the
[52:53] time a 5-year-old and and and they they
[52:56] uh they had an allowance and they were
[52:58] saving money and um you know I had an
[53:01] app where they could see their savings
[53:03] and you know spending in savings account
[53:06] and it was just all in an app just to
[53:09] kind of keep track of things but um I
[53:12] think they were they were trying to save
[53:14] for
[53:16] um something um where it would probably
[53:19] was going to take a number of months and
[53:22] um I uh
[53:25] I I had this moment where where I I had
[53:28] to try to explain to them that the price
[53:30] of the thing was going to keep going
[53:32] up and uh they had sort of a little bit
[53:35] of a WTF moment right they were they
[53:37] were saving at a certain savings rate
[53:40] and uh yeah they uh they they had their
[53:44] I think first sort of like realization
[53:47] like um without knowing very much at all
[53:50] that that that Bitcoin was going to um
[53:53] allow them to save for things
[53:55] quicker
[53:57] um also through that lens of a
[54:00] 5-year-old uh or or more you know any
[54:03] any kid
[54:05] um
[54:07] they and I and I you know you kind of
[54:10] said how old you are but the reality is
[54:12] like kids now like growing up grow up in
[54:17] a world where uh digital things have
[54:20] value and uh I would say that
[54:25] to Circle back to your very first
[54:27] question around the
[54:28] misconceptions I would say that probably
[54:31] is one of the biggest ones most people
[54:34] do not uh they cannot see that this
[54:39] thing this digital money uh has value
[54:45] and we have digital things in our lives
[54:50] um you know photos music you know
[54:53] information knowledge
[54:55] uh that we all ascribe a certain amount
[54:58] of value
[54:59] to and I think that's to to to answer
[55:02] your first question last I think that's
[55:04] one of the biggest things people just
[55:06] not seeing or understanding how this
[55:09] thing can have
[55:11] value with kids 5-year-olds uh 10year
[55:16] olds they have grown up in a world where
[55:19] digital things have value and I'll say
[55:22] this Robin I to be honest think that
[55:24] most kids get this uh infinitely quicker
[55:28] than grown-ups as a result of that they
[55:30] just like of course digital things have
[55:32] value and so this is just you know yet
[55:35] one more thing and it ties again to the
[55:39] ability to to save and see you know
[55:42] their savings grow quicker in Time
[55:45] versus you know uh you know inflating
[55:48] away so yeah this this is why I was
[55:51] really impressed by your father because
[55:53] he was what 70s 80 years old when he was
[55:57] interested in Bitcoin uh I see a lot of
[56:00] older people like bu 60 years old they
[56:04] have a hard time understanding um that
[56:09] something you cannot touch has value
[56:13] kids they buying uh skins in some video
[56:17] games they know the value of of digital
[56:19] things we don't have to teach them that
[56:22] maybe we have to teach them properties
[56:24] of some money
[56:25] uh old the people know more about the
[56:29] properties of some money but they
[56:31] sometimes have the problems it's digital
[56:33] how can it be value I just I I can just
[56:35] copy it I get that a lot I can just copy
[56:39] Bitcoin when I make like Bitcoin itself
[56:42] is uh scarce but what if they're like
[56:44] 20,000 Bitcoin then it's not scarce in
[56:47] right so I I get that a lot yeah for
[56:51] sure so I'm I was impressed with with
[56:54] your father is at like how old was he 75
[56:57] 80 years old yeah um that time that
[57:01] early in Bitcoin it it takes a lot of
[57:05] curiosity and openness to learn at that
[57:09] age such a complete new technology I
[57:12] think for youngsters it's more easy for
[57:15] like 20 30 40 years old people
[57:18] yeah um where can people uh find you
[57:22] where can they best get in touch with if
[57:25] you uh what what K you find out about
[57:27] you in the on the internet yeah for sure
[57:30] Rob um you know I think on X probably
[57:34] the best spot Jeremiah Susi um you can
[57:38] throw up my my handle um I've got a
[57:41] LinkedIn presence uh as well but uh I
[57:44] think the best spot to find me is on on
[57:47] on X Twitter for sure oh perfect thank
