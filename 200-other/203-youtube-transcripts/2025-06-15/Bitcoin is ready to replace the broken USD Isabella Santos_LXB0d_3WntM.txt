[00:00] the US dollar is coming to its final end
[00:02] building circular economies does work to
[00:05] spread the right knowledge about Bitcoin
[00:08] is super super important if you think
[00:10] you can make a better book write that
[00:12] book it is our duty as bitcoiners if you
[00:14] can just teach what you know to someone
[00:17] that you know you know you're doing your
[00:19] part like what are you doing to leave
[00:21] the world better than you found it if we
[00:23] want Bitcoin to work huddling the
[00:25] Bitcoin what's that going to do we need
[00:28] to treat it as cash we need to be able
[00:31] to spend it we need to able to save in
[00:33] it and I think the mentality to hudle
[00:37] what's the end goal you're going to have
[00:38] to spend it eventually let's be honest
[00:40] the ones that survive are the ones that
[00:42] are willing to adapt not the smartest
[00:44] not the strongest not the prettiest not
[00:47] you know the
[00:48] [Music]
[00:51] funniest hi Isa how you doing everything
[00:53] fine on your answer everything is
[00:55] perfect learning a lot from Austrian
[00:59] people
[01:00] yeah we talked before
[01:02] about the the culture of Austria and and
[01:05] skiing there it's really the lack of
[01:08] Austrian economics knowledge in Austria
[01:11] that's a big thing there's no Austrian
[01:12] economics in in Austria like I didn't
[01:15] know I learned like I told you right
[01:17] before we started I learned about austan
[01:20] economics when I encountered Bitcoin
[01:23] before even though I learned uh and
[01:25] studied in Austria never heard about
[01:27] AUST economics uh and I thought it's a
[01:29] economics is like the economics in
[01:31] Austria currently now like there's
[01:33] nothing special about Austria uh but
[01:36] anyways it's it's a funny story and I
[01:38] even interviewed people that studied
[01:40] economics in Austria but they never
[01:42] heard about Austrian economics before
[01:43] Bitcoin so it's it's it's interesting
[01:46] when did you encoun Austin economics did
[01:48] it was it with Bitcoin it was with
[01:50] Bitcoin I honestly have I didn't study
[01:54] economics and my view on
[01:57] economics is not the Best of You Well I
[02:02] wouldn't
[02:04] say um the best because you
[02:08] know I'm
[02:11] sorry I I'm not the smartest one out
[02:14] there but um I just have this funny
[02:17] story to tell with you know economics
[02:19] professor because my brother is studying
[02:22] economics and I told them ask your
[02:24] professor about
[02:26] Bitcoin and they're teaching them about
[02:30] inflation and about why the dollar is
[02:32] like so good and why you need inflation
[02:35] in order to
[02:36] work and I just thought it was so funny
[02:39] how the professor had no idea about
[02:42] Bitcoin and why he was even looking into
[02:44] it but aside from that Austrian
[02:47] economics I discovered it I haven't gone
[02:49] in into the Austrian economic RIT who
[02:51] I'm not going to lie um I did do an
[02:54] episode on it in Bitcoin
[02:57] backstage and I'm not to familiar with
[03:01] with it so that that's my my take on
[03:04] Austrian economics but the first time I
[03:06] heard about it was through Bitcoin yeah
[03:09] you're crazy about uh educating people
[03:11] and I love it and we talked about it
[03:13] before you having the short pH content I
[03:17] prefer a little bit the longterm content
[03:19] I'm like oh [ __ ] I also have to produce
[03:20] shorts and all that stuff uh but you
[03:24] said something uh you you have to grab
[03:26] people's attention you actually have to
[03:27] get them where they are and they are at
[03:30] the Instagram reals there the YouTube
[03:32] shows at the Tik toks of the world um
[03:35] why are you like let's take a step back
[03:37] why are you so um passionate about
[03:40] educating people about Bitcoin Freedom
[03:42] inflation why inflation is not good and
[03:44] all that stuff well I'm very
[03:48] pro-education because at the end of the
[03:51] day we're not born knowing so if you
[03:55] know something obviously who am I to
[03:58] teach someone but the thing is I know
[04:00] more than the normal than the normal
[04:04] people do about Bitcoin so if I can
[04:07] teach them what I know then I'm doing
[04:10] them a
[04:11] service um it's funny I was just doing
[04:14] another interview and it reminds me
[04:18] because I was talking about why I always
[04:20] like to give back and it all comes down
[04:23] to that why am I educating people
[04:26] because it's my way of giving back and I
[04:29] I feel like in the Bitcoin industry we
[04:32] all have to contribute in order for it
[04:34] to work you know if you're a coder you
[04:37] need you know you find ways to develop
[04:40] on bitcoin if you know you know how to
[04:44] do comedy do comedy based on bitcoin
[04:46] like what can you bring to the table
[04:48] because it's you know it's a a monetary
[04:52] system that will only work if we want it
[04:55] to work if we wanted to stop working
[04:57] it's not going to work so the idea to
[05:00] spread the right knowledge about Bitcoin
[05:04] is super super important that I feel
[05:06] like not many people have the ability to
[05:10] learn about Bitcoins people learn in
[05:12] different ways whether it's through
[05:14] videos and also through you know reading
[05:17] books and that's why I've always I've
[05:20] also steered to teach in person and do
[05:24] in-person
[05:25] classes because everybody learns
[05:28] differently so I think it is our duty as
[05:32] bitcoiners if you can just teach what
[05:35] you know to someone that you
[05:38] know you know you're doing your
[05:41] part I saw that uh I what is it in
[05:45] Salvador what what are you doing like I
[05:47] I just saw your pictures where you're
[05:48] like you have a students and it's in
[05:50] person I I love that so much it is in
[05:53] Islam mes it's this little island off of
[05:56] the coast of
[05:57] Cancun and
[06:00] it started out as a passion project but
[06:03] it's been I've been pushing forward like
[06:05] the first graduating class is going to
[06:07] be this Friday it was supposed not this
[06:10] Friday this Thursday it was supposed to
[06:12] be Monday but the students didn't have
[06:14] their final project
[06:15] ready uh because we had a hurricane
[06:18] coming in and obviously like the
[06:21] hurricane trumps everything so the they
[06:24] were like we didn't have time to do our
[06:25] projects because the hurricane came in
[06:28] so we're going to guide you on Thursday
[06:30] oh interesting it's it's it's what like
[06:34] just to give the people a feeling what
[06:36] are you doing there is like are you just
[06:39] having a course where there's like the
[06:41] basics of Bitcoin uh or is it more like
[06:44] how to handle Bitcoin with self custody
[06:46] and like from what angle are you uh
[06:49] explaining them Bitcoin so I'm teaching
[06:53] them the current curriculum of me PR
[06:55] Bitcoin and it embarks everything it
[06:58] embarks what is the you know what's the
[07:02] history of money what is bitcoin how
[07:04] does Bitcoin work and how to self
[07:06] custody and it's a 10-week course on
[07:11] every week well I did two classes per
[07:13] week no two classes per month for the
[07:16] students so we started out in April if
[07:19] I'm not mistaken and they finally
[07:22] completed the first course but the idea
[07:25] of the project is to orange pill the
[07:27] whole island this is just like the
[07:30] beginning phase of the project where I'm
[07:33] teaching them about Bitcoin and the idea
[07:37] is from that graduating class is I want
[07:39] to select one of the students to come
[07:41] and help me orange pill the whole
[07:44] island but you got to start somewhere
[07:48] and I'm starting with the
[07:49] education how how many people on the
[07:52] island like how uh how many do you have
[07:54] to Ste Ed aate well there's
[07:57] 22,000 habitants in the island it's a 14
[08:01] kilometer by
[08:03] two and the thing is it all started when
[08:07] I went to Peru and I did a documentary
[08:10] with Julian about Motif Motif is a
[08:14] nonprofit organization that's building
[08:16] these circular economies all across Peru
[08:20] and what he's doing there is God's work
[08:23] he's using Bitcoin as a tool for freedom
[08:26] but also that's just only one arm of the
[08:30] T like of the octopus you know that's
[08:32] one tentacle of the octopus he's also
[08:34] teaching these people like how to sew
[08:37] how to build businesses how to be
[08:40] Sovereign
[08:41] individuals and when I went to see the
[08:44] docu when I went to record the
[08:46] documentary I was like this is what I
[08:48] want to do in Islam
[08:50] credits the island is small enough for
[08:53] me to start by myself and it's small
[08:56] enough where there's also tourists that
[08:58] come that can can potentially use
[09:00] Bitcoin and it just has a lot of Pros
[09:05] obviously you have the cons that are
[09:06] like the narles but it's a good place to
[09:10] start and I in my thought I was like if
[09:12] I can scale this then people can
[09:14] probably replicate what I'm doing and
[09:16] see that building circular economies
[09:19] does
[09:21] work I love it a lot and I also had uh
[09:24] from Premier uh me Premier Bitcoin um
[09:28] Quenton on uh Quenton araman I think
[09:31] it's his name uh who was working with
[09:34] them and also told us about like uh what
[09:38] he's doing with the open source lectures
[09:40] and with the open source of of of the
[09:42] education it's really interesting um
[09:44] what what you doing that you you
[09:46] mentioned circular economy um how do you
[09:48] do that like how how do we uh make more
[09:52] circular economy get people to spend the
[09:54] Bitcoin I I feel like um getting people
[09:57] to spend the Bitcoin is really hard like
[09:58] they they want to hold on to them well
[10:01] that's the thing if we want Bitcoin to
[10:04] work huddling the Bitcoin what's that
[10:07] going to do you know so obviously I
[10:12] think we all need to Well everybody's
[10:14] entitled to do whatever they want but my
[10:17] thing is obviously yes have your stash
[10:19] that you huddle but also have you know
[10:21] your stash that you save and you start
[10:24] earning in Bitcoin and I'm no expert I
[10:29] have't haven't built a Bitcoin circular
[10:30] economy yet but there's some out there
[10:32] and what I've noticed that does work is
[10:34] you have to get the merchants and the
[10:37] people that are buying and selling you
[10:39] know take away like everything that you
[10:41] know about Bitcoin and just focus on its
[10:43] core sole purpose for what Satoshi
[10:47] intended it to be you know electronic
[10:49] peer-to-peer Cash System eliminating the
[10:51] third um the third parties
[10:55] permissionless and stick with that
[10:58] obviously I do work a lot with the
[11:01] lightning Network because the students
[11:04] that I have and where I am located they
[11:10] for them to manage and have Bitcoin on
[11:13] chain is practically impossible I say
[11:16] impossible because they earn so little
[11:20] that their fees outweigh the money that
[11:23] they have in Bitcoin so it is not it
[11:27] like it's not it's not effective for
[11:29] them to maintain their Bitcoin on chain
[11:32] but anyway that's besides the point
[11:35] um what I suggest for anybody that wants
[11:39] to do is you have to talk to the
[11:41] merchants and just have them accept
[11:43] Bitcoin then having like let's be real
[11:47] out of a hundred customers probably one
[11:50] of them will pay in Bitcoin and that
[11:52] doesn't mean that the merchant has to
[11:54] automatically sell that money you don't
[11:57] want them to sell that Bitcoin
[11:59] for Fiat they just need to like stay
[12:03] with it and then they'll familiarize
[12:05] themselves with the price because all of
[12:08] them are very concerned with the
[12:10] volatility or the scam that go around
[12:13] you know Bitcoin because many people on
[12:16] the island what I've realized is they
[12:19] get scammed by using the word Bitcoin
[12:22] and they relate it with all the other
[12:24] cryptocurrencies that are out
[12:26] there so if you can get merch to accept
[12:29] Bitcoin and you be one of the ones to
[12:32] pay that's a huge start it's also for me
[12:36] um so important that we ask our
[12:40] Merchants that we are engaging with
[12:43] Merchants every day like you go to
[12:44] restaurants you go to bars you go to an
[12:47] electronic uh uh store you go uh I don't
[12:50] know where where you go but you you go
[12:52] somewhere you spend your money and
[12:54] everywhere you go and you have aeal this
[12:56] personal connection with them at a
[12:58] restaurant waitress or whatever um just
[13:02] ask them hey can I be with Bitcoin and
[13:05] you don't have to be a pain in the ass
[13:07] with that you just like have to like hey
[13:09] can I pay with Bitcoin and then shees is
[13:11] like No And like okay perfect then can I
[13:13] pay cash a carard like just but just the
[13:15] question like think about uh what this
[13:18] will do to the staff of that restaurant
[13:21] if if they get that question like five
[13:24] six times a week then all of the sudden
[13:26] they're like maybe we should look into
[13:28] that maybe we should uh talk uh we
[13:31] should talk about that and then they
[13:33] familiarize them with them like they get
[13:35] maybe some someone in that can help them
[13:37] if there are like there's so many uh um
[13:40] vendors there's so many people that help
[13:42] uh you to onboard Bitcoin in your stores
[13:45] like uh I feel like that's a really
[13:47] underrated way to drive Bitcoin
[13:51] adoption yeah it's super underrated that
[13:53] you can do on your own and one thing
[13:56] that you will realize is a lot of people
[13:58] are intimidated by Bitcoin they're like
[14:01] oh or they're like it's too late I
[14:03] already missed the bus I'm not going to
[14:05] invest or I you know I can't afford one
[14:08] full Bitcoin so there are these
[14:11] misconceptions that need to be addressed
[14:15] and sometimes like if they do say
[14:17] something like that it is you know you
[14:20] should speak up about it you know and be
[14:22] like address sorry is that I'm in a
[14:25] public place I'm in a house so people
[14:29] will be moving around my where that no
[14:32] no no worries at least for me not and
[14:35] then the
[14:37] dogs but that that's something that I
[14:40] would say you don't have to do a Bitcoin
[14:43] circular economy you just have to start
[14:45] with the nearest Merchant that you have
[14:47] you know that coffee shop that you go
[14:48] all the time and it's easier if you know
[14:52] the owner what do I mean by if you know
[14:54] the the owner you don't have to be
[14:55] friends with them just talk to them
[14:58] normally they're already there and
[15:00] they're running the businesses I'm not
[15:02] saying like Starbucks but there's small
[15:05] businesses everywhere so if you do go to
[15:07] a small business they're mostly the ones
[15:11] to accept Bitcoin there's already like
[15:13] three in three places three restaurants
[15:16] in you cred that accept Bitcoin because
[15:20] I talk to the
[15:21] owners directly so it's not just about
[15:25] going hey just to the waiter or to like
[15:29] the guy that brings you the check it's
[15:30] like you know ask oh is the owner here
[15:34] by any chance I wanted to ask him a
[15:36] couple questions Lally they're they want
[15:39] their business to succeed and nobody's
[15:41] going to say no to money that that's the
[15:43] thing especially when we come to the
[15:45] point where bitcoiners are starting to
[15:48] be um knowing what where are the coffee
[15:52] shops they accept Bitcoin like there's
[15:54] the the Bitcoin map and there's like all
[15:56] those apps where you can actually look
[15:58] when when we get to a point where
[16:00] bitcoiners are like I want to spend my
[16:02] Bitcoin and I only go to the coffee
[16:03] shops that accept Bitcoin then it's like
[16:06] real cross roots movement because as you
[16:08] said those Starbucks those McDonald's
[16:11] they probably do it once they have to do
[16:13] it like once it's legal law or like they
[16:16] they see such a big amount but the small
[16:19] coffee shops like it's not that
[16:21] complicated to accept fitcoin it's like
[16:23] you have to talk to to your tax
[16:25] consultant you you have to set up like a
[16:27] device it's it's it's nothing nothing
[16:29] that cannot be done for a business
[16:31] person for the businesses and people are
[16:34] like they'll normally ask you like oh
[16:36] how do I accept it or they if they do
[16:40] have a wallet it's probably nor most
[16:42] likely it's wallet of Satoshi or in my
[16:45] case it's uh
[16:47] beo I do recommend to also research
[16:53] about
[16:55] coin.io because it's a lightning wallet
[16:58] that is it's the best it's non
[17:01] kyc and it works flawlessly obviously it
[17:06] has some issues but it gets the job done
[17:10] and you can set it up as a merchant and
[17:12] what I mean that you can set it up as a
[17:14] merchant is that it allows the let's say
[17:17] that the coffee shop it allows the owner
[17:19] to have on his phone the main Coos
[17:23] account and then all the people that are
[17:26] going to you know collect the check they
[17:29] can have you know EXA they can have
[17:31] access to the coin house without taking
[17:35] away Bitcoin they can only accept
[17:39] Bitcoin that's interesting that that
[17:42] that's a cool inside do you think that
[17:46] Bitcoin needs that like do you think
[17:47] that the circular economy that we spent
[17:50] our Bitcoin is is necessary to drive
[17:52] adoption or can it also be just like weh
[17:54] hold it no obviously we need it if we
[17:58] want hyperbitcoinization
[18:01] then I think we need to treat it as cash
[18:06] not cash but as you know yeah as cash we
[18:09] need to be able to spend it we need to
[18:12] able to save in it and I think the
[18:16] mentality to huddle
[18:19] like what what's the end goal you know
[18:22] you're going to have to spend it
[18:23] eventually so I think instead of
[18:27] spending it cuz I don't know what
[18:28] people's plans are when you huddle so
[18:30] much money like is your plan to then
[18:32] convert it into Fiat or wait for
[18:34] everybody else you know to do the heavy
[18:36] lifting and convince you know Merchants
[18:39] to accept
[18:42] Bitcoin and then you can spend your
[18:44] Bitcoin we're like what what are people
[18:46] waiting for I think it's a huge job for
[18:50] all the
[18:51] bitcoiners to make sure that we are
[18:55] making the bit like the make the Bitcoin
[18:57] that we use and you know that we have if
[19:01] you're a business owner offer the
[19:04] ability to pay your employees in Bitcoin
[19:08] you know I know that's a huge barrier
[19:10] sometimes companies don't want to pay
[19:12] their employees in Bitcoin or they don't
[19:15] want to receive Bitcoin but they're
[19:17] Bitcoin companies and you're like
[19:19] Brother come on you know try to adapt
[19:23] and you know not like let's leave the
[19:27] Fiat system in a way
[19:29] when do you think um do you have a time
[19:32] frame or obviously it's impossible to to
[19:34] predict anything but do you have a
[19:36] framework where you think of like when
[19:39] this happens or at this time we might be
[19:43] actually able as Society to leave the
[19:45] the fear system I myself don't think we
[19:49] can
[19:50] completely um leave it in my lifetime
[19:53] I'm now 25 so like when I live another
[19:57] 75 years uh it it's hard for me to
[20:00] imagine but then there are people coming
[20:02] in my podcast seeing like oh feed will
[20:04] be gone in five years and I'm like
[20:07] how do do you have like a time frame or
[20:09] like a framework to think about that or
[20:11] what or like an event that has to happen
[20:14] in order to to get rid of Fiat system
[20:17] well I think a catastrophe has to happen
[20:19] in order for us to Le the Fiat system I
[20:23] think we're entering this battle with
[20:26] you know the governments and the big
[20:28] corpor ations because in a way Bitcoin
[20:30] is a silent Revolution and they're
[20:33] starting to realize how powerful Bitcoin
[20:36] is and the people that are in power
[20:39] they're not just going to give up their
[20:41] power just like that we're talking about
[20:44] decades decades and hundreds and
[20:46] hundreds of years of these people being
[20:48] in power the same families being in
[20:50] power they're not just going to get up
[20:52] and be like here take it no it's going
[20:54] to be a fight and it's not going to go
[20:59] easy and it's something that I agree I
[21:03] don't think we'll see it in our lifetime
[21:06] because it's it comes down to with how
[21:10] people are born I think it is up to the
[21:12] new generation that's growing up being
[21:15] born with satoshi's
[21:17] gift it's their dut they're the ones
[21:20] that are going to be able to maybe see
[21:23] the end of the Fiat system but I don't
[21:26] think we will
[21:29] it's I think a l i mean hopefully we do
[21:32] see it you know eventually we never know
[21:34] how things work especially in technology
[21:37] the time flies in technology I think a
[21:39] year in Bitcoin is like equivalent to
[21:41] five years in you know the Fiat system
[21:44] but something probably really really bad
[21:48] has to happen for the Fiat system to end
[21:51] and it always does like you know I think
[21:54] the US dollar is coming to its final end
[21:57] especially since it's became you know
[21:59] the global money and monetary systems
[22:02] have like a Lifeline of about what like
[22:04] a 100 years so it it could end it could
[22:09] end uh soon uh that that's that's why
[22:12] I'm so confused in my head like at some
[22:14] point I I see that argument for feat
[22:16] collapsing quite soon because uh you
[22:19] already have
[22:20] inflation like all the small things that
[22:23] happen all the events that happen it
[22:25] dles down like Co was just first event
[22:29] that happened that triggered a lot of
[22:31] money printing what when next year
[22:33] something else happens they they figure
[22:35] something else out like what like
[22:37] whatever does there there's some
[22:39] catastrophe then they spend more like
[22:42] like every time we spend we have to
[22:43] spend so much more than before because
[22:45] we have to pay the interest on
[22:47] everything um it's it's it's hard for me
[22:51] to to grasp the the the head around how
[22:53] they will survive 70 years but I do not
[22:57] think so I think it's there's a
[22:59] difference between the end of the US
[23:03] dollar and then the end of the Fiat
[23:05] system like the end of the US dollar
[23:07] doesn't mean that because if if it
[23:09] collaps then automatically the Fiat
[23:11] system is going to end and I think we
[23:14] can see a lot of that the like all these
[23:18] other countries like China and Russia
[23:21] they're all trying to build their own
[23:23] cbdcs that's still Fiat even though it's
[23:27] not physical
[23:28] they're still got like that's still a
[23:31] former Fiat system and eventually it'll
[23:34] work for
[23:35] them and I don't know when that end will
[23:40] be though because going against Russia
[23:43] and China oh my
[23:46] gosh that that one's gonna be rough I
[23:50] don't know what's scarier the United
[23:52] States Russia or
[23:56] China what are you saying
[23:59] like for the any any fights you know
[24:02] what I mean they're like the the they're
[24:05] pure evil powerhouses that are
[24:09] scary which one do you think is is more
[24:12] scary like uh us or or China and Russia
[24:16] combined oh my gosh well the thing is
[24:18] Russia and China you know that what
[24:21] you're getting into they're they're like
[24:23] hey we're Communists you know what I
[24:25] mean like this is what we are they have
[24:27] the whole saying but then the United
[24:29] States they're sneaky about it they're
[24:32] like oh we don't control you guys and
[24:35] then all of a sudden you have everything
[24:38] that they're controlling us you know I
[24:41] don't know I think in a way the United
[24:43] States is scarier because you don't know
[24:47] what is happening behind the scenes
[24:49] while Russia and China they're very you
[24:52] you know what you would be getting
[24:54] yourself
[24:55] into what I don't know what do you think
[24:58] it's a really hard one like right now I
[25:01] think uh America has the advantage like
[25:04] they they are the it's really hard to
[25:08] say like China there are so many people
[25:10] also like Russia and China combined they
[25:12] are so much bigger also than than than
[25:14] America it's h it's it's really hard to
[25:17] suppressed people though that's the
[25:20] thing yeah and they don't have uh yeah
[25:23] still it's it's interesting yeah I still
[25:26] would feel like America is stronger yeah
[25:28] yeah
[25:29] actually what do you think is the the
[25:32] freest country of the world like where
[25:35] would like a freedom Bitcoin loving
[25:37] person um uh or like a freedom like I
[25:41] think a Bitcoin loving person it would
[25:43] be very declin to do to like Salvador
[25:46] and something like that but a freedom is
[25:49] is there something else you I think of
[25:52] the most free would be living on an
[25:54] island you don't realize how free it is
[25:57] and how you don't have any laws and you
[26:02] honestly can do whatever you want so I
[26:05] think to be like hey this country that
[26:09] would be a disservice because I feel
[26:12] like all Islands in a way they govern
[26:15] themselves they're so secluded from the
[26:18] mainland that sometimes they're even you
[26:21] know
[26:22] they're they're forgotten in a way so I
[26:26] think if someone wants to be free being
[26:30] on an island away from the real world
[26:34] that's where you will find Freedom it's
[26:36] it's like that fifth child that uh where
[26:39] the parents are don't are governing the
[26:41] child that much as like the first child
[26:44] exactly the last one they're like yeah
[26:46] do whatever you want they're the most
[26:48] forgotten
[26:49] overseen um because at the end of the
[26:53] day the country is going to care about
[26:56] like the main country you know like look
[26:57] at
[26:59] ratan even has their they even have
[27:01] their own um like what's it called their
[27:04] own they have their own it it has a
[27:07] special word but ratan has an area that
[27:10] it's like has their own laws that the
[27:14] country laws from Honduras can't even
[27:17] access them it has a name
[27:21] but jurisdiction or like jurisdiction
[27:24] and everything it's crazy like is super
[27:27] super were interesting and that goes to
[27:29] show all the islands they have their own
[27:32] type of you know little community and
[27:35] little governance that they can
[27:38] do yeah ran is is interesting I I think
[27:41] we even like talked three four times
[27:43] already on the podcast about that with
[27:45] different guests did you were there uh
[27:48] personally the what did you were on on
[27:51] Ro to already like no not yet I do want
[27:55] to go um what what did you say before
[27:59] where you made the documentary was it
[28:01] Peru or was it something some other
[28:03] place yeah it was Peru I did a
[28:06] documentary there with Modi and their
[28:11] nonprofit organization that they built
[28:15] over 16 circular economies what is uh
[28:19] like why Peru and what what what what do
[28:22] you especially in Latin America I don't
[28:24] know if you were proba were already in
[28:25] El Salvador I guess no you were not in a
[28:29] wow I still haven't been to oh now I
[28:32] feel better myself that I wasn't
[28:35] there I I haven't been to Salvador
[28:38] hopefully I'll be soon to experience it
[28:40] but no um for Ru well I did the
[28:44] documentary because I'm Peruvian and
[28:47] that's one of the reasons why Julian
[28:49] reached out to me he's like hey you're a
[28:51] Bitcoin or you're Peruvian you know
[28:53] let's go do a documentary in Peru and
[28:55] cover this really great things about you
[28:58] know what motive is
[29:00] doing H but motive chose Peru because
[29:04] the guy that's on the ground his name is
[29:07] Valen he's actually from
[29:10] Romania but he moved to Argentina when
[29:13] he was 18 to escape communism and he
[29:17] ended up in Peru for some reason so he's
[29:21] not even Peru and he's doing insane
[29:25] things and helping the community he
[29:28] actually stumbled across Bitcoin because
[29:31] he was always
[29:33] doing um he was always giving back and
[29:37] volunteering
[29:39] and it was during the pandemic that he
[29:43] needed to get
[29:45] food to you know the people like the
[29:50] like in the poor communities and the
[29:53] only person that would donate during the
[29:55] pandemic was a bit Wier nobody knows who
[29:58] the bitcoiner was but the bitcoiner only
[30:02] requested for him he's like hey I'll
[30:05] give you
[30:06] Bitcoin obviously you guys need to fact
[30:09] check this I'm just summarizing this you
[30:11] know as as best as I can but the idea
[30:14] for it was Valen received this huge
[30:17] donation in
[30:18] Bitcoin but his the only thing he needed
[30:21] to do was find Merchants that accepted
[30:24] Bitcoin in order for him to buy so he
[30:27] had to like orange pill Merchants to
[30:31] accept Bitcoin for him to actually
[30:34] create these baskets and give the food
[30:38] to the people that he was supposed to do
[30:40] so that's how he actually became a Bas
[30:42] corner thank you you already made it
[30:44] halfway through the video and I'm really
[30:46] really grateful to have you here two
[30:48] things make this channel possible you as
[30:50] a watcher and listen and who keep
[30:52] supporting this Channel and another one
[30:55] is all the Bitcoin brands that I partner
[30:57] up with like 21 Bitcoin who support me
[31:00] from the very start and where I
[31:02] personally buy my Bitcoin from with code
[31:04] Robin you even get a discount when you
[31:06] buy Bitcoin with them and now also
[31:08] bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[31:11] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[31:14] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[31:16] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[31:18] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[31:21] be in that 98% bracket be in the 2%
[31:24] bracket and if you have self- custody
[31:26] and you know your friend doesn't not
[31:28] have maybe he needs a Christmas present
[31:30] maybe he needs a birthday present and a
[31:32] small life Heck if you use code Robin
[31:34] you get 5% off your order plus you
[31:37] support my channel and now let's get
[31:39] back to the video so wa he got uh
[31:42] Bitcoin from a
[31:44] donator uh and then uh in order to buy
[31:47] something from that he needed to the
[31:49] merchants to accept them like why why
[31:53] did you not want to exchange it for
[31:55] fear because the was the donor's request
[31:59] for him to use the Bitcoin like instead
[32:03] of selling he's like no if you like I'm
[32:06] donating this the only way you have to
[32:09] figure out you know what you're going to
[32:11] do with the money you've got to buy the
[32:14] stuff that you're gonna give to the um
[32:17] to the people using the
[32:20] Bitcoin oh that's that's beautiful
[32:23] that's a great Bitcoin mind right there
[32:25] he he he was thinking like he was not
[32:27] like ah I only want to give Bitcoin I
[32:29] want to give Bitcoin with that condition
[32:32] so we can actually drive Bitcoin ad
[32:34] option there um what do you think like
[32:37] when you're now like you're from Peru
[32:39] then yes I I'm from Peru a really really
[32:43] cool what can those countries like I
[32:47] feel like those countries can especially
[32:50] benefit from from Bitcoin yeah either
[32:52] more than the us or Europe right now
[32:54] like everyone will benefit from Bitcoin
[32:57] in certain but especially like Latin
[33:00] America I feel like can have an huge
[33:03] Advantage if they're Early N Bitcoin
[33:05] well these countries um are a lot
[33:09] overlooked and they're actually the best
[33:12] ones to adopt it quickly without asking
[33:15] options it's like that bell curve you
[33:17] know the normal people don't get it but
[33:21] those outliers are the ones that get it
[33:23] the most and I realize that in third
[33:25] world countries they need a lifeline so
[33:28] when you throw them this Lifeline which
[33:31] is Bitcoin they will grab onto it and
[33:34] there's a lot of people in the industry
[33:37] that I've noticed that are from
[33:38] Venezuela that are you know from Brazil
[33:41] that are from El Salvador that have no
[33:44] other options so they automatic like
[33:47] they've been pushed to choose Bitcoin
[33:52] and in Europe and in the United States
[33:55] it's an option so it's it's like yeah
[33:58] you have it there if you ever need it
[34:00] but they don't have the necessity to use
[34:03] it and the thing is in these third world
[34:07] countries the government has neglected
[34:10] them so much like there's people that
[34:12] are that don't have a bank account that
[34:15] they're
[34:16] unbanked and I'm not saying that I'm
[34:19] like Pro bank but it's also easier in a
[34:24] way to go from not having a bank account
[34:28] and using cash to just using Bitcoin
[34:31] because a lot of what I've noticed is
[34:33] when I talk to people that have gone to
[34:36] college that have studied you know until
[34:39] they were 18 years of age they're
[34:42] automatically asking like oh what is
[34:44] money you know what is bitcoin backed by
[34:46] or you know how can you use it if it
[34:49] doesn't come with the bank and it's kind
[34:52] of like they need to unlearn everything
[34:54] they've learned and that they were
[34:57] taught
[34:58] because they were you have to look in
[35:00] like who is the ones that you know
[35:02] taught you all of this and in a way
[35:04] they've been indoctrinated to think this
[35:06] type of way so if you go to the people
[35:08] that have been neglected by the system
[35:12] you can actually teach them the right
[35:15] way and when I mean teach them is you
[35:18] give them the options so they can choose
[35:21] what they want you know it's NE you
[35:23] never like obligate someone hey you got
[35:25] to use you know Bitcoin but it's like no
[35:28] like this is an option for you that you
[35:29] can you know send your money to someone
[35:32] that lives you know thousands of miles
[35:35] away without you even having a bank
[35:37] account and having to ask for permission
[35:39] to use your own hard-earned money that
[35:42] that's that's really interesting that um
[35:45] people that are not banked are like
[35:48] closer to bitcoin because they don't
[35:51] have to unlearn that whole field uh
[35:54] clown show that that that they learn so
[35:57] so nicely and it's it's like yeah like
[36:00] for me it was not easy to to get like oh
[36:02] where do I get Bitcoin and like why do I
[36:04] need some some separate device to store
[36:07] it like all my other stocks and
[36:09] everything else is like in my broker
[36:12] like why why do I need an extra device
[36:13] for that that's that's
[36:15] interesting no 100% And it's the
[36:19] response oh when I was going to this
[36:21] documentary through my parents were like
[36:25] how are they having Bitcoin like they
[36:28] don't have bank accounts and you're like
[36:30] you don't need a bank account to have
[36:32] Bitcoin like people forget that you can
[36:35] earn Bitcoin by doing work you can get
[36:40] paid in Bitcoin you know you can figure
[36:42] out how to you know spend it but
[36:45] sometimes I think we always so always
[36:49] talk about you know buying in the dip
[36:51] and buying Bitcoin and stacking SS but
[36:55] there are people out there that you know
[36:58] do work for Bitcoin there's actually
[37:00] this guy on Twitter that I follow that
[37:02] he started selling baklava for Bitcoin
[37:06] in like 2010 so it's you just have to be
[37:10] creative in a way and figure out you
[37:13] know what you can do to earn Bitcoin you
[37:16] don't necessarily have to you know spend
[37:19] you know buy it in strike or all these
[37:23] wallets like all these exchanges yeah
[37:26] that's that's a profitable business
[37:27] starting selling anything in in
[37:31] Bitcoin in
[37:33] 2010 right that that's a great business
[37:37] model right
[37:38] there that's that's a that's a crazy f i
[37:41] i i love it a lot what you saying it
[37:43] gives me a lot to think about
[37:46] um like only because I'm I'm curious did
[37:48] you ever experience with Al coins did
[37:50] you ever go to that that altcoin r or
[37:53] did you st with with Bitcoin from the
[37:55] beginning no I
[37:58] think I learned so later on I learned in
[38:01] 2021 about Bitcoin and the people that
[38:04] introduced me to bitcoin they're
[38:07] hardcore Bitcoin Maxis and they went to
[38:12] I think they also experienced with
[38:14] altcoins I don't know their backdrop
[38:16] Journey but they made sure that I was
[38:19] like full uh Bitcoin only and they
[38:22] taught me and they explained to
[38:25] me why and and why is Bitcoin different
[38:30] than all these other chains blockchains
[38:33] tokens whatever you want to call them
[38:36] from the get CCO and I think that's a
[38:38] lot of people get into Bitcoin for you
[38:43] know they come in for the gains but most
[38:46] of them stay for you know the
[38:48] Revolution and I was taught super
[38:52] early what Bitcoin stood for and I'm
[38:56] very loyal so if I like something I'm
[38:58] going to go and stick to it so I didn't
[39:01] have that ability to go out and wander
[39:05] with you know ethereum or all the other
[39:08] type of coins but I would have to say is
[39:13] I don't know if it would have been
[39:14] different if I would have gone into
[39:17] Bitcoin if it was lower I got in a
[39:20] Bitcoin in Peak bull market you know it
[39:23] was 69,000 in 2021 when I am invested
[39:27] all my money into it so I was like hell
[39:31] no I am not selling anything I do not
[39:35] what like if I don't sell I'm not losing
[39:37] anything and that gave me enough of a
[39:40] time to learn myself more about Bitcoin
[39:44] and once you
[39:46] know and you agree like I don't know you
[39:49] have to be blind not to agree with what
[39:51] Bitcoin stands for
[39:53] but the more I learned the more I
[39:56] realized that is more than just you know
[40:00] an electronic cash system that's why I
[40:03] never sold and I always stacked and
[40:06] stacked but I didn't I mean I I stacked
[40:10] what I could I'm not like a Bitcoin
[40:12] millionaire or anything but that's one
[40:15] thing that I think it was kind of like a
[40:17] blessing in disguise you know to enter
[40:20] when it was super high because I learned
[40:22] a
[40:25] lot it's uh you you you always enter at
[40:28] a height and then you have to learn uh
[40:31] four or five years to be patient yes
[40:35] it's uh it's a great way to end I feel
[40:37] like it's it it strengthens
[40:40] your uh believe in it it strengthens
[40:43] your abilities uh and and you don't get
[40:46] like oh what should to do when the price
[40:48] like I think like peak of the bull
[40:51] market or like the the the bare Market
[40:54] where is really silent those are the two
[40:57] best times to enter because in the bare
[40:59] Market there's not a lot happening there
[41:01] not a lot of trauma you just enter price
[41:03] is not doing a lot of things that's a
[41:06] great uh way to get or like when you
[41:08] invest and you're like oh [ __ ] it's
[41:10] going down 50% I don't want to lose
[41:11] anything
[41:13] now that's that's a that's a great way
[41:16] um I always ask uh nowadays chat TVD
[41:19] before I go to the podcast what I should
[41:21] what I should ask my my guest about and
[41:26] uh I don't know maybe May made a wrong
[41:28] research but uh he said I should ask you
[41:31] about art and what what role Bitcoin in
[41:33] art plays are you a big fan of
[41:37] art um actually yes I like Arts I
[41:42] actually make some for
[41:44] fun and I don't know what role Bitcoin
[41:48] plays um it's I don't have um what what
[41:52] are the new ordinals it's not that I
[41:55] have ordinals or anything but I have
[41:58] made art and sold it for Bitcoin before
[42:01] so that that's
[42:03] fun but actually i' like physical Arts
[42:06] physical Arts yeah physical Arts yeah
[42:09] yeah was like I almost forgot the names
[42:11] but because I know now there's like
[42:13] ordinals and everything but with art I
[42:17] think I did I'm not going to lie I did
[42:20] like the idea of
[42:22] nfts the idea of them was super
[42:25] interesting for artist because it gave
[42:30] the artist the opportunity to build a
[42:32] community and not many creators you know
[42:38] get
[42:39] recognition so it was a cool
[42:42] concept but I think involving in into
[42:47] Bitcoin I don't know honestly
[42:50] like I I don't know I'm not an expert I
[42:53] would lie if I said I was but I if you
[42:55] can make art and sell it for Bitcoin why
[42:58] not you know I used to make 3D art and
[43:04] well I still make some but so right now
[43:06] my hands are a little full building the
[43:08] the Bitcoin School in China orange F the
[43:10] island but I've made some custom pieces
[43:13] and
[43:14] stuff uh yeah it's that's an interesting
[43:17] debate with with nfds because um art is
[43:22] always subjective and people are like oh
[43:24] how can you pay like millions of dollar
[43:27] for a monkey picture and and I'm
[43:31] like it it is their choice like it's
[43:34] it's like in a free market like the free
[43:37] market sets the price and if someone is
[43:40] willing to pay that it might be a stupid
[43:43] decision overall because maybe he loses
[43:46] 90% or like maybe 100% of it but it's
[43:50] still valid like like the Bitcoin
[43:53] incentivizes a free market so if there's
[43:55] some some nfts on top of Bitcoin I would
[43:58] never engage in that like I I don't care
[44:00] about that at all but if someone does
[44:03] like go for it and and also like when
[44:07] when when they are an attack on bitcoin
[44:09] because some people Al like argue oh
[44:11] they are attack on bitcoin yeah then
[44:13] let's let's attack it like B Bitcoin is
[44:17] attacked since day one like everyone
[44:19] always attacked Bitcoin uh in 2013 China
[44:23] joined with without attacking Bitcoin
[44:25] they still try they still f
[44:27] like attacking Bitcoin is what what
[44:29] Bitcoin is famous for like it always has
[44:32] been attacked and it always gets
[44:34] stronger with it that's the key word it
[44:36] gets stronger with it and I think in
[44:39] order for us to you know reach
[44:41] hyperbitcoinization and you know have
[44:44] eight billion people on the system we
[44:46] need to find its holes we need to find
[44:50] what's wrong with it for it to you know
[44:53] adapt and to evolve because at the end
[44:56] of the day I guess I know like let's be
[45:00] honest the ones that survive are the
[45:02] ones that are willing to adapt not the
[45:04] smartest not the strongest not the
[45:07] prettiest not you know the funniest it's
[45:10] the one that's most able to adapt to
[45:13] whatever situation it's put in and I
[45:16] think putting bin through all these T
[45:18] not like these tests but that it's
[45:20] thrown into these you know examples like
[45:23] with the ordinals and it comes and it
[45:27] still works and it can you know improve
[45:30] the system and how it works that's
[45:33] what's going to allow Bitcoin to you
[45:36] know be able be able for eight billion
[45:39] people to use the system because
[45:43] before you know there was n such H there
[45:46] was no such thing as a lightning Network
[45:50] and you know if you look back four years
[45:52] ago or six years ago you had to use
[45:55] Bitcoin transactions
[45:58] on using onchain and even Satoshi in one
[46:02] of like his talks he says that in order
[46:04] for it to work we need to learn how to
[46:08] scale it down and use Bitcoin and not
[46:12] use so many fees so I think the
[46:15] lightning Network uses a really good um
[46:18] alternative even though it has its like
[46:21] bad sides but that's what we're here to
[46:23] do you know that's why it's open source
[46:26] for everybody to improve it and make it
[46:29] better yeah I feel like the the scaling
[46:31] Bitcoin is a really interesting one I
[46:34] try to figure it out and that's why I
[46:35] invite people that are smarter than me
[46:37] because I don't have a clue how to scale
[46:40] Bitcoin uh that's why I ask like people
[46:42] from the lightning network uh people
[46:45] that are for the fedin uh people are for
[46:48] uh liquid all that different things like
[46:52] from AR I also had someone on now uh
[46:56] yeah uh so like so many people and the
[46:59] the thing that I kind of is like
[47:01] everyone agrees on like we cannot build
[47:03] everything on Lightning uh but lightning
[47:06] might be the the high the Super Highway
[47:09] between uh like an arc or between a Fint
[47:13] and then with Fint we we really spend
[47:16] our Bitcoin but we have our lightning
[47:18] wallets with like a lightning bank or
[47:20] whatever like those are like really
[47:22] abstract things that I'm just saying now
[47:25] but uh I think it's
[47:27] but we need to try them in order to see
[47:29] if that they work like they can't just
[47:31] be left with ideas you know so I think
[47:34] sometimes people get so caught up in the
[47:37] in Bitcoin that they're like it has to
[47:39] be how it is and we need to find other
[47:43] solutions to make it more acceptable for
[47:46] other people to on board and use Bitcoin
[47:50] yeah and uh the I love the thing that
[47:52] you said with adopting it's it's for me
[47:54] it's like Bitcoin is almost like water
[47:57] and like you push it everywhere and it's
[47:58] just like flows where it has to flow
[48:01] like it's so it's an amazing
[48:04] thing I like that it's like I've heard
[48:08] the phrase you know you got to be like
[48:09] water you put it in a cup it'll fit in
[48:12] the cup you put it in a plate it'll fit
[48:15] in the
[48:16] plate yeah I'm uh I like that a lot
[48:20] because I think it comes from some some
[48:23] kung fu fight or something like that
[48:25] like I heard that and I resonated so
[48:28] much with that because I'm a swimmer
[48:30] like I swim since all my life like since
[48:33] I'm like four years over something like
[48:35] that I was a professional swimmer at
[48:37] National level in Austria H like water
[48:40] is such an amazing comparison because
[48:43] you can punch it all you want it will
[48:46] volatile like it it will have some waves
[48:48] but after a while it will be still it
[48:51] will be just like before and that's like
[48:53] kind of Bitcoin you can punch it you can
[48:55] attack it but after after a while it
[48:57] just still and it it just does does it
[49:00] its thing it's it's a wonderful
[49:02] comparison I like that I never thought
[49:04] about it like that I thought it was
[49:06] putting it in a cup but that is so true
[49:08] you have like tsunamis and then the
[49:11] calmness or like the con before the
[49:14] storm yeah water is
[49:19] amazing let's drink more
[49:22] water um the the last thing that I want
[49:25] to get into with you is uh actually
[49:28] maybe I have a second thing depending on
[49:30] on how long we talk about that um you
[49:33] have get based and you make so many
[49:35] interesting videos and you make the the
[49:39] opposite videos that I do like I do very
[49:41] long form videos but uh I mean I I don't
[49:43] know you probably also do do do you do
[49:45] any long firm videos also like off 30
[49:49] minutes or something like that the long
[49:51] form videos are the documentaries that
[49:54] we do and yeah they range they from 20
[49:58] to 45 minutes but I like to stick more
[50:02] to the short-term content you know one
[50:05] minute videos I'm starting this new
[50:07] project called BTC Isa where I explain
[50:10] what I'm doing on the island and that's
[50:14] still it's going to be short content
[50:17] it's going to be three to seven minute
[50:18] long videos um
[50:22] because I believe we've steered to like
[50:28] I don't know I really like fast-paced
[50:31] content and to be able to put the ideas
[50:34] that you have in like three to seven
[50:36] minutes and
[50:39] yep that that that was your question
[50:41] right if I do long-term I do both I do a
[50:44] little bit of everything yeah is is it
[50:48] my my question with where I I wanted to
[50:51] go is um what is get based I think you
[50:54] are involved with that with with tr
[50:57] also who who else is there involved in
[51:00] like what are you doing with with G
[51:02] based what's the goal of it so get based
[51:05] is a production agency and a Content
[51:09] creation agency we started in febru like
[51:14] we we decided to launch this project in
[51:18] January and it started because when I
[51:21] was doing the per do Julian and I
[51:25] realized we worked really well together
[51:27] and we wanted to create content and not
[51:31] have to ask permission not have to beg
[51:34] for sponsors you know to give us the
[51:37] funding to create this great ideas so we
[51:40] realized we wanted to work together
[51:42] because we had these visions that we can
[51:45] you
[51:46] know like that phrase it you work it
[51:50] takes a village you know there's so much
[51:52] that you can do by yourself but with
[51:55] other people to help you you can achieve
[51:57] whatever you want easier and faster and
[52:01] Julian had also done another documentary
[52:03] with Adam and I think they went to
[52:06] watala together and they also wanted to
[52:10] do something together so when Julian met
[52:13] me I was kind of like the missing piece
[52:14] of the puzzle and we decided to create
[52:18] get based which is this company that we
[52:22] help other companies build their
[52:24] Community their build their communities
[52:27] through Fearless storytelling so our
[52:30] idea and our vision is to awaken the
[52:34] sovereign individual and be able to like
[52:38] push them to their limits and you know
[52:41] create do we just had like a huge long
[52:44] meeting today about our vision I don't
[52:46] know why I'm blanking out but the idea
[52:49] for it is for us to create content that
[52:52] inspires other people but at the same
[52:56] time makes them feel good and we not
[52:59] only do it for ourselves we have where
[53:01] we create our shows we have future proof
[53:04] we had wrong think but um with wrong
[53:07] think we're switching it up we're doing
[53:10] BTC Isa and we have the documentaries
[53:12] where we either go to different parts of
[53:15] the world to explore how Theon adoption
[53:17] has made a thing or we do these crazy
[53:22] you know mind and body uh crushing
[53:28] experiments and we also offer the part
[53:31] where we help other companies create
[53:34] that content and we do the heavy lifting
[53:36] for them you know because if you're a
[53:39] company let's say you're a
[53:42] wallet you want to focus on being the
[53:45] best wallet that there is out there you
[53:47] don't have time in your hands to you
[53:50] know drift off and build that Community
[53:53] or you know create that content so we
[53:56] want to take that and do it for
[54:01] them I I love it a lot that uh I think a
[54:04] lot of Bitcoin uh companies need that
[54:08] yeah and also based companies it doesn't
[54:12] have to be a Bitcoin company at the end
[54:13] of the day we are looking for people
[54:17] that have that vision and that future
[54:20] and that hope you know and obviously yes
[54:25] Bitcoin company but also you know that
[54:28] farmer that is selling you know really
[54:31] good meat across the street from you we
[54:34] want those types of people as clients
[54:36] too because they're bitcoiners without
[54:39] knowing that they're
[54:40] bitcoiners then you can also orange buil
[54:42] time it's in the
[54:45] process amazing I love it perfect then
[54:48] closer to the end of um one question
[54:50] that uh every all of my guests are
[54:52] getting um what can we learn from you
[54:55] besides Bitcoin and what we talked about
[54:58] already what can they learn from me I
[55:04] guess to just start now um a lot of us
[55:08] don't think that oh we always expect
[55:11] someone else to do what we want to do
[55:14] like let's say for teaching you know
[55:17] we're like ah people should you know
[55:19] make better books about Bitcoin so then
[55:21] maybe other people can learn it's like
[55:23] no if you think you can make a better
[55:25] book write that book do that book you
[55:28] know what are you doing to leave the
[55:30] world better than you found it try to
[55:33] help
[55:34] and don't put limits on yourself you
[55:37] know don't wait until like the moment is
[55:39] perfect for you to start like if I'm
[55:41] going to write that book I need it to be
[55:43] perfect no just start writing it
[55:45] everything's going to fall into place
[55:47] eventually I laughed it a lot uh it's
[55:50] it's like starting it getting the
[55:52] courage uh I I talked before with
[55:54] Alexander swety and we we had a similar
[55:58] similar talk in the middle of the the
[56:00] podcast and and I laughed it a lot and
[56:02] and it was just like an hour before you
[56:04] also something like that it's a great
[56:06] topic that we can get into um but now to
[56:09] the endro the actual endro of the
[56:11] podcast where we have the question from
[56:15] the previous guest uh like the previous
[56:17] guest asked a question for you without
[56:19] knowing who the next guest is actually
[56:20] is so without knowing who you are um and
[56:24] your question from the previous gu is if
[56:27] someone gifted you 1,000 Bitcoin what
[56:30] would you do with
[56:31] them 1,000
[56:34] Bitcoin what would I do with 1,000
[56:39] Bitcoin uh first of all that would be
[56:41] super
[56:43] nice and yeah I'd be like thank you what
[56:47] did I do to deserve this um I would
[56:51] honestly just right now because I'm
[56:54] thinking of what I'm doing right now I
[56:55] would continue to expand Bitcoin Isa and
[57:00] expedite BTC Isa because we need you
[57:05] know it needs funds in order to work
[57:10] because people don't want to work for
[57:12] free so it's hard for me to recruit
[57:15] people without me offering them
[57:18] something in return other than you
[57:21] know so for me that would expedite the
[57:26] process of orange pilling the island and
[57:29] making it possible so I can offer
[57:33] Bitcoin coures after school because in
[57:36] Bitcoin I in ises the school system is
[57:40] from 7 to 11 a.m. so it would be perfect
[57:43] to have an after school program teach
[57:46] English to the kids and also about
[57:49] Bitcoin and obviously the plan would be
[57:52] to orange pill the taxi Mafia because
[57:55] there a huge taxi Mafia on the island
[57:59] too uh but that's where I would put all
[58:03] the ads to to make that Bitcoin circular
[58:07] economy work what what's the story
[58:09] behind the taxi Mafia that sounds
[58:11] interesting oh my gosh so in this island
[58:15] how I told you guys you know if you want
[58:16] to be free go to an island but there's
[58:19] also a l
[58:21] monopolies and it's very hard to come in
[58:25] as an outs Ider and start your own
[58:27] business and you know do anything and on
[58:31] the island there's many mafias as in the
[58:34] taxi Mafia where there this whole Union
[58:39] you cannot become a taxi driver without
[58:41] their approval you know they're the only
[58:45] form of transportation like there's no
[58:47] way Uber is going to exist on this
[58:49] island they they recently added public
[58:52] transportation one huge bus that takes
[58:55] you from end of the island to the other
[58:58] and the first couple of months where the
[59:02] government the the people there added
[59:05] the bus system the taxi drivers would
[59:09] beat the living hell out of the taxi of
[59:13] out of the bus driver so they're not
[59:17] very um Keen to welcoming new businesses
[59:21] that is going to take away from them
[59:22] like on this island there's not that
[59:24] many cars so they use a lot of golf
[59:27] carts and if you let's say are a hotel
[59:30] and you want to offer a golf cart
[59:32] business like you know offer your guest
[59:35] golf cart Services you
[59:38] can't so it's kind of crazy how it
[59:42] works so even though it's a very free
[59:47] Island um you see that there are there's
[59:51] maybe a need for someone uh to come in
[59:54] and make a non- Monopoly Market possible
[59:59] well it's free but it's not a free
[60:01] market yet so free but not a free market
[60:05] yeah so there's obviously there the
[60:08] leaders are not you know the big
[60:10] corporations and the governments they're
[60:12] morly like cartels and business
[60:16] owners that
[60:19] so
[60:20] interesting yeah it's human nature to
[60:23] Auto H need someone to lead
[60:26] a community so I think that's that's one
[60:30] thing is certain there's always going to
[60:32] be a leader in a community someone
[60:34] that's going to you know take care of
[60:36] the people in a way and we can see it
[60:39] with that AB absolutely it's that is
[60:43] very interesting B but uh uh before let
[60:46] you go and before forget where can
[60:49] people find you where can people ask
[60:50] your questions reach out to you what's
[60:52] the best place for that the best place
[60:56] so I am on
