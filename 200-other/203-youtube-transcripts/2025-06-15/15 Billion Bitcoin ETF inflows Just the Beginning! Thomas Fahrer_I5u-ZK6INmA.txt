[00:00] I see Bitcoin going up 100x over the
[00:02] next decade there's been about 15
[00:04] billion roughly in inflows into these
[00:06] ETFs in the first 6 months if you look
[00:08] at the most successful launches of ETFs
[00:11] ever number one is black rocks Bitcoin
[00:14] ETF and number two is Fidelity's Bitcoin
[00:16] ETF and that's like all ETFs ever once
[00:19] it's been traded for 90 days advisors
[00:22] start to have enough of a history that
[00:24] they can come to their clients and they
[00:25] can say you know I've Got This brilliant
[00:27] idea about this investment for you and
[00:30] it's this ibit Bitcoin has got this
[00:32] 15-year history but these products don't
[00:35] and you have to understand about who
[00:37] these products are for as soon as
[00:39] Bitcoin becomes normalized be 1% of the
[00:41] portfolio that would be enough to really
[00:44] drop a massive bull market Bitcoin
[00:46] doesn't need Michael saor like Bitcoin
[00:48] is happening with or without Michael
[00:49] saor it just so happens that you know
[00:51] it's it's great when you have very smart
[00:53] intelligent articulate people explaining
[00:55] the ideas is it was better to buy 10
[00:56] years ago than today and better to buy
[00:59] today than in 10 years time eventually
[01:01] we'll see the first country to print
[01:04] money to buy Bitcoin that's going to be
[01:06] a big deal when that happen and the
[01:07] first one to do that they're going to
[01:09] really
[01:10] [Music]
[01:13] benefit and you're tracking the the
[01:15] bitco really closely I'm unfortunately
[01:17] not like I should do a better job in
[01:19] tracking the Bitcoin ETF uh and you're
[01:22] doing a lot of things with with charts I
[01:24] also saw that the I think the inflow
[01:27] tracker or flow tracker on on your
[01:29] website some some something like that it
[01:31] was really cool to see um first of all
[01:33] like like why are you doing that like
[01:35] what what's the significance maybe of of
[01:37] of DF and why are you putting so many
[01:39] charts and Analysis about that out yeah
[01:42] sure look I mean we're tracking the
[01:45] tracking the these Bitcoin ETF flows
[01:47] because I would say that
[01:50] really the US ETFs um it's it's the
[01:54] biggest story in Bitcoin 2024 and I
[01:57] would say going forward and what I mean
[02:00] by that is not just anyone particular
[02:02] ETF but it's really this kind of story
[02:06] of um Bitcoin embedding itself into the
[02:09] traditional Financial system and this is
[02:12] really the major way in which adoption
[02:16] is going to happen
[02:18] for uh certainly the majority of the
[02:21] capital going forward if not necessarily
[02:24] people you know vast vast majority of
[02:28] the actual Capital that is going to into
[02:30] Bitcoin is going to come through I
[02:32] believe uh through this mechanism
[02:34] because it's the best and easiest way
[02:36] for kind of Institutions to adopt
[02:38] Bitcoin
[02:39] essentially yeah and for me it's also
[02:41] like when when you have the um the
[02:44] biggest changes like there are a lot of
[02:46] really uh like older people that have a
[02:48] lot of money that have family businesses
[02:51] and and they don't want to have self
[02:53] custody maybe and they just want to pick
[02:55] up the phone and say Hey I want to have
[02:57] 20 million in Bitcoin and I think those
[02:59] are the the adoption curves that is like
[03:02] Bitcoin kind of grew up with the Bitcoin
[03:04] EDF as as I see it um but the one thing
[03:07] that I always get asked when I make
[03:09] anything about Bitcoin ETF why did the
[03:12] price not rise enough like not not not
[03:15] as as much as many expected I mean the
[03:17] the expection was really high I think
[03:19] Samson ma put something up with like a
[03:21] million price Target in within weeks
[03:23] when the Bitcoin gets La something like
[03:25] that there were some crazy price targets
[03:27] out there um where you disappointed with
[03:30] the the launch of the ETF no I I I
[03:33] haven't been disappointed um I mean I
[03:36] think that when you look at kind of like
[03:38] million price targets or any of this
[03:40] kind of stuff I mean look I don't want
[03:41] to speak for Samson but I would estimate
[03:45] when I when I when I see someone like
[03:47] Samson put out a million dollar price
[03:49] Target on on bitcoin I don't read that
[03:53] as going Bitcoin is like that's not how
[03:55] I read it I like I don't read it as
[03:58] Bitcoin is going a million I read it as
[03:59] I'm really bullish on bitcoin that's
[04:01] what I think Samson is saying I think
[04:04] that um you know if people are taking
[04:07] that stuff
[04:08] literally they're going to be
[04:10] disappointed but that's not you know
[04:11] that's not how Twitter really works like
[04:13] I don't uh I I wouldn't uh suggest
[04:16] anyone take that kind of stuff literally
[04:18] but what I would say is the
[04:21] ETFs like they have been extremely
[04:23] bullish for Bitcoin and are extremely
[04:25] bullish for Bitcoin and when you look at
[04:28] what most people proed for in terms of
[04:32] the actual inflows into these
[04:34] ETFs I think they've just far out Shawn
[04:38] most people's expectations now you did
[04:41] have standard chared come out and they
[04:43] predicted about hundred billion doar in
[04:45] Bitcoin U inflows over the first 12
[04:47] months but they were by far the outlier
[04:51] most sort of pundants analysts actually
[04:55] had no expectations of these flows
[04:58] anywhere close to what we've seen
[05:00] you know if you look at the most
[05:02] successful launches of ETFs ever number
[05:06] one is black rocks Bitcoin ETF and
[05:08] number two is Fidelity's Bitcoin ETF and
[05:11] that's like all ETFs ever so I don't
[05:15] think anyone could be reasonably
[05:16] disappointed at seeing that yeah look
[05:18] there's been about 15 billion roughly in
[05:21] inflows into these ETFs in the first six
[05:23] months and especially when you consider
[05:26] that this isn't you know it's not like a
[05:30] binary onoff switch realistically like
[05:33] there's actually a process here or a set
[05:38] of kind of checkpoints and dominoes that
[05:40] needs to fall in order for the flows to
[05:44] really get going into these ETFs because
[05:47] it's there's a lot of infrastructure
[05:49] that needs to be put in place you need
[05:51] to have
[05:51] wirehouses offer these ETFs you need to
[05:54] have Brokers offer them they're not they
[05:57] need to be available on platforms so and
[06:00] that that's happening like slowly over
[06:02] time a lot of people still don't have
[06:04] access to these ETFs and then also when
[06:07] you consider that the the expectation
[06:11] the reasonable expectation is
[06:14] that you know each one of these things
[06:16] is a new security effectively and for a
[06:18] financial advisor to offer it to their
[06:21] clients it needs some kind of trading
[06:23] history so it's actually extremely
[06:26] common that you would expect yeah you
[06:28] know wait for it to trade I mean there's
[06:31] a kind of a 90day trading rule that
[06:33] typically happens with these things
[06:34] where once it's been traded for 90
[06:37] days advisers start to have enough of a
[06:40] history that they can come to their
[06:41] clients and they can say you know I've
[06:43] Got This brilliant idea about this
[06:45] investment for you and it's this ibit
[06:48] you know because Bitcoin has got this
[06:50] 15year history but these products don't
[06:54] and you have to understand about who
[06:56] these products are for it's for kind of
[07:00] traditional financial advisors and and
[07:02] this sort of thing these are the kind of
[07:04] new players that are coming in to invest
[07:07] in invest in Bitcoin it's
[07:10] not for for you know the majority of
[07:14] kind of traditional retail or
[07:16] whatever they can just you know coin Bas
[07:19] was around last year too so we didn't
[07:22] didn't need these ETFs it's for a new
[07:24] class of investors and for these this
[07:26] class of investors you would expect that
[07:28] it takes time it's like hey I'll invest
[07:30] when you know my my brokerage allows it
[07:33] to happen and it just isn't available
[07:36] for and and it won't be
[07:38] available all at once it happens over
[07:41] time so look you know when I look at
[07:43] that and I go okay 15 billion in flows
[07:45] in six months it's good start it's good
[07:49] start do you think that the the biggest
[07:51] thing is still come because I feel like
[07:53] uh we have been in the ATF I think half
[07:56] a year now something like that so like
[07:58] almost 6 months here now India uh and I
[08:01] get the argument that like a lot of
[08:03] thing takes time like you like it's it's
[08:06] it's it's usually not like one person
[08:08] say like oh yeah let's let's buy
[08:09] something there's like a board there's
[08:10] family businesses and even that one
[08:12] person needs time to to get used to it
[08:14] and educated on it uh so I get that it
[08:18] takes time do you think that the the the
[08:21] the major adoption of a Bitcoin EF will
[08:25] come in like the next few years and this
[08:28] is just like a small B the laying the
[08:30] ground works of it that would be that
[08:33] would be my assumption and I think
[08:34] that's what a lot of people actually
[08:36] expected going in um I think the
[08:39] probably the easiest analogy or the sort
[08:43] of comparison is look just looking at
[08:45] the Gold ETFs from 20 years ago you know
[08:48] GLD opened up but the flows weren't
[08:50] really there in the first few months
[08:52] actually if you look at it historically
[08:54] you you look at it after 5 years and GE
[08:56] it had these massive inflows into GLD
[08:59] and it let
[09:00] an enormous bull market for gold but it
[09:03] didn't happen overnight um so I don't
[09:06] necessarily think we should expect
[09:07] anything different for Bitcoin really
[09:09] it's for me fascinating we always have
[09:10] those stories in Bitcoin like when 2020
[09:13] was this the first publicly traded
[09:15] company with micro strategy with 2021
[09:18] was really dominated by El Salvador
[09:20] basically and now it's like the the
[09:22] Bitcoin DF time but when I look at
[09:25] everything it's it's kind of what's
[09:27] what's the next story I feel like the
[09:29] next story is just everything that we
[09:31] worked now all the groundwork all the
[09:34] buckets that we have to fill they now
[09:37] all a little bit Filled from like 1%
[09:40] maybe and then we're filling all the
[09:41] buckets up or do you see any any any
[09:44] next
[09:45] story after the ETF anything that you
[09:48] look at like oh we we need that to
[09:50] actually come to those uh price targets
[09:52] of a million or three million or five
[09:54] million yeah look I I would say that the
[09:58] biggest thing is normalizing Bitcoin as
[10:02] an allocation within a Investment
[10:05] Portfolio so like a really big moment
[10:09] will be when Black Rock puts it in their
[10:12] balance fund and they say we think as a
[10:15] as a part of a normal balanc portfolio
[10:18] Bitcoin should be 3% of the portfolio
[10:21] not only because that that in itself
[10:24] will drive um a significant amount of
[10:27] flows just from Black Rock liter Lally
[10:29] buying Bitcoin to fill up their balance
[10:32] fund but also because of the signal that
[10:35] sends to the rest of the world that if
[10:37] you're managing a traditional portfolio
[10:41] you're an Institutional manager managing
[10:44] a portfolio you're a pension
[10:46] fund or any frankly any kind of just
[10:50] 6040 balanced uh portfolio out there it
[10:53] needs to have some some sort of
[10:54] allocation to bitcoin and when that
[10:56] becomes normalized that's when you see
[10:58] these
[11:01] well I mean if that's when you see these
[11:04] massive flows coming into Bitcoin and
[11:06] you think about how many trillions of
[11:08] assets there actually are managed going
[11:11] into these equities and bonds
[11:12] essentially entirely when you now you
[11:14] have a new asset class and as soon as
[11:16] Bitcoin becomes normalized any any piece
[11:18] really it doesn't even it doesn't even
[11:20] if it was normalized to be 1% of the
[11:22] portfolio that would be enough to really
[11:26] drive a massive bull market and it
[11:28] hasn't happened yet realistically we've
[11:30] had some kind of very early adopters so
[11:34] you got some Pension funds like
[11:35] Wisconsin pens the Wisconson pension
[11:37] fund which has got a tiny allocation to
[11:40] bitcoin but realistically you don't have
[11:43] many uh actual it's it's it's a very
[11:47] kind of uh novel position to take to say
[11:49] Bitcoin is appropriate as a part of your
[11:52] balance portfolio it's just not
[11:53] something that's we really see right now
[11:56] yeah and I think we we have to step out
[11:58] a little bit of our Bitcoin Twitter
[12:00] world where everyone is bullish and
[12:02] everyone is like a Bitcoin 100% Bitcoin
[12:04] 80% uh when you step out in the normal
[12:07] world you see that people don't get
[12:10] Bitcoin they don't have any Bitcoin uh
[12:13] and they don't even know some of the
[12:15] basics like this this meme with 21
[12:18] million go ahead and ask on the street
[12:20] how many people know what's the
[12:22] significance if with the number 21 in
[12:24] Bitcoin I think probably like 95% of 100
[12:28] people don't know about it so we're
[12:29] really early on um that's why I think
[12:32] education is is is is so so important
[12:35] for for us bitcoiners what do you see
[12:37] like is is there anything else that we
[12:39] should do like is education the the
[12:41] number one key and everything else is
[12:43] kind of kind of falling uh to that I
[12:45] will say that in some sense I think
[12:49] we're now kind of Bitcoin
[12:51] is um you know this kind of community of
[12:55] Bitcoin is online of kind of been the
[12:57] Vanguard of Bitcoin education done an
[12:59] amazing job with like podcasts and
[13:02] YouTube and books and this sort of thing
[13:04] over the past decade and I think what's
[13:06] what's going to happen over the next
[13:08] decade is we're kind of handing that off
[13:12] to Black Rock and to Fidelity and to
[13:16] these institutions so that they can
[13:18] speak the language of the real the real
[13:21] money like these this institutional
[13:24] Capital to flow in because you know the
[13:28] the kind of mematic ideas that might
[13:30] have convinced you or me are not the
[13:33] same not the same thing that is needed
[13:36] to find the next sort of unlock the next
[13:40] pools of capital and that's why for
[13:43] example some really like some really
[13:46] fundamental ideas that are crucial to
[13:49] the foundation of Bitcoin like Bitcoin
[13:51] is freedom money it's it's it's it's an
[13:54] incredibly important Meme and it it it
[13:57] is was very important
[14:00] last cycle in 2020 and and it still has
[14:04] a kind of a foundation for the uh I
[14:09] guess the kind of the the Bitcoin
[14:11] maximalists the people that will hold on
[14:13] no matter what but it's Freedom money is
[14:16] not the meme to convince a pension fund
[14:19] to allocate 4% of their their portfolio
[14:22] to bitcoin what what will convince them
[14:24] is look look at the diversifying
[14:27] properties of Bitcoin within your
[14:28] portfolio look at the expected returns
[14:30] look at the sharp ratio look how it it's
[14:33] going to you know off offer just a
[14:36] significant enhancement to to your
[14:38] portfolio these are the kind of things
[14:40] that black rock like this is this is
[14:42] what they do this is what they're good
[14:44] at in terms of speaking that kind of
[14:47] language to uh the next kind of larger
[14:50] pools of
[14:52] capital but the the kind of the
[14:55] foundational stuff that comes from like
[14:57] Bitcoin Twitter and this sort of thing I
[14:59] still think it's really important for
[15:02] convincing like your neighbor to buy
[15:05] Bitcoin but that's kind of the reason
[15:09] what the where I would sort of
[15:12] differentiate or distinguish the thing
[15:14] is is that when you're talking to your
[15:16] neighbor about Bitcoin you're not doing
[15:19] that to help Bitcoin you're doing that
[15:22] to help your neighbor like like that's
[15:24] that's not really kind of it doesn't
[15:27] matter to bitcoin whether you're your
[15:29] friend buys Bitcoin or they they can't
[15:31] affect the Bitcoin price at this point
[15:33] it's completely irrelevant if you you
[15:35] know your your loved one if you can
[15:37] convince a loved one to buy Bitcoin it
[15:38] just doesn't make any difference
[15:39] whatsoever to bitcoin but it will make a
[15:42] big difference to their lives and so I
[15:45] still think in that sense education is
[15:47] like you know offering them you know
[15:50] getting them to listen to your podcast
[15:52] or just or just providing some books or
[15:55] some history and this sort of thing is
[15:57] is great for you know friends family or
[16:00] the people you want to orange pill along
[16:01] the way but that's probably not the kind
[16:05] of educational material that's needed to
[16:08] you know unlock the serious Capital
[16:10] that's going to drive Bitcoin from you
[16:12] know sitting at 60k to 500k that's it's
[16:16] just a different it's just a different
[16:18] uh different base
[16:20] really yeah I also see it like this this
[16:23] mind shift that I had like I think it
[16:26] was a year ago where I went like oh like
[16:29] I don't need to Orange peill anyone for
[16:32] Bitcoin but I still should orange peill
[16:35] people that I love because it's kind of
[16:37] an act of service to them like they they
[16:40] should know about it they they benefit
[16:41] from it long term when I tell them now
[16:44] about it I cannot force them uh I I
[16:47] cannot tell them like do it uh they will
[16:51] do it if if they want to but I should at
[16:53] least make sure that once I told them
[16:57] that I think it's a really good idea and
[16:59] you should look into that uh so it's
[17:01] it's kind of an an act of service if you
[17:04] will so because yes you're right like
[17:06] even if I convince all my friends to
[17:09] invest in Bitcoin and they put all their
[17:11] money in there Bitcoin does like that's
[17:13] that's so such a small amount of money
[17:16] um it's it's like maybe Michael saor
[17:19] when
[17:20] he orange pills the the Michael DS and
[17:23] and other people that that makes a
[17:26] difference maybe uh because they come in
[17:29] with a lot of money and they have a lot
[17:30] of very powerful friends but the the
[17:32] normal blabs don't really make a huge
[17:35] difference in the in the price long term
[17:37] it makes a difference in in Grassroots
[17:39] movement because then more people maybe
[17:41] go to a store and ask hey can I pay with
[17:43] Bitcoin or more people ask to go to bank
[17:46] and ask them about Bitcoin or they more
[17:48] people go to politicians and ask them
[17:50] hey what's your opinion on bitcoin like
[17:52] from a Grassroots movement perspective
[17:55] um I think it does make a difference um
[17:57] but not really from a price perspective
[18:00] it's more like a a small Crossroads
[18:04] movement kind of a thing yeah
[18:06] look I I agree with that and
[18:10] also if if if it kind of relied on I
[18:13] think I think the fact that it doesn't
[18:15] rely on you or I or anyone really orang
[18:19] people is why it work like if it if it
[18:21] that's probably what distinguishes it
[18:24] from some of these other other memes
[18:27] like uh take like
[18:30] a a kind of a common example today in a
[18:33] different world but tangential might be
[18:35] like gme you know getting people to
[18:37] invest in the GameStop phenomenon like
[18:40] that's where you really do need to find
[18:43] the next guy to jump on GM like it's
[18:46] really important to spread that gme Meme
[18:49] because the the fundamental mathematics
[18:52] of the like that stock is not going to
[18:54] work unless people unless you can
[18:56] convince more hordes and hordes and
[18:58] hordes of people to jump on it with
[19:00] Bitcoin it's different it's you know it
[19:03] will affect in some sense like the rate
[19:05] of obviously price appreciation will
[19:08] change depending on kind of uh the
[19:13] velocity of the meme and how excited
[19:14] people are about
[19:16] Bitcoin but there is these kind of
[19:18] fundamentals of 21 million Bitcoin
[19:20] versus infinite Fiat money that
[19:22] everything will kind of take care of
[19:24] itself regardless of um
[19:29] you know how convincing how convincing
[19:31] people are with like their look how
[19:34] convincing people are with their their
[19:35] memes and their all their their orange
[19:38] pilling benefits I mean take someone
[19:39] like Michael saor who I think has been
[19:42] fantastic for the Bitcoin community in
[19:44] terms of expressing some great ideas
[19:48] about why why Bitcoin is so important
[19:51] for the
[19:52] world but Bitcoin doesn't need Michael
[19:54] saor like Bitcoin Bitcoin is happening
[19:57] with or without Michael it just so
[19:59] happens that you know it's it's great
[20:00] when you have very smart intelligent
[20:03] articulate people explaining the
[20:05] ideas yeah that's a that's a big thing
[20:08] like it's it's great to have those
[20:10] people on our team it's great to have
[20:11] them on our team but at the same time
[20:13] when you make this experiment like okay
[20:15] what if Michael C was not there there
[20:17] are still a lot of great people that
[20:19] have a lot of great ideas and then
[20:21] they're like oh maybe maybe like uh
[20:24] there will come in the future really
[20:26] good people that like then uh are the
[20:28] big on the on the Bitcoin conference
[20:30] because right now it's like when you go
[20:31] to bitcoin brag or anything like that
[20:33] Michael S is the uh one of the biggest
[20:36] stars even though also like some haters
[20:39] are there but usually like people really
[20:41] like him because their IDE are really
[20:42] strong what what I thought about now
[20:44] when when I heard what you're saying
[20:46] about gme why why do you think so many
[20:49] people buy in narratives like gme or mem
[20:53] coins or altcoins I mean there are
[20:55] sometimes beautiful stories but if you
[20:57] look from a r
[20:59] perspective on those things you're like
[21:01] no I don't invest my life savings in
[21:04] there yeah I
[21:06] mean well there's there's probably a
[21:09] macro and a micro I mean from
[21:11] people I mean you look at a lot of the
[21:14] trends you see that gambling is
[21:16] massively On The Rise uh in society and
[21:20] certainly relative to where it was a
[21:21] couple of decades ago
[21:24] and you know historically this is
[21:27] something that just seems to be really
[21:28] highly correlated
[21:30] with uh when the when when money is
[21:32] being debased people start to kind of
[21:34] speculate and gamble more uh this is
[21:37] like when you read a book like Fiat
[21:40] money inflation in France they did talk
[21:43] about the Fiat inflation that happened
[21:45] or the money printing that happened at
[21:48] at a couple hundred years ago in France
[21:50] and during that period of basically
[21:52] massive debasement of French money they
[21:55] you had massive amounts of gambling and
[21:57] and we've actually seen that in
[21:59] societies
[22:01] across humans for hundreds of years
[22:04] there are so many different examples of
[22:06] that popping up and I think what happens
[22:07] is that people we don't really have any
[22:11] kind of obvious like store of value so
[22:14] in that world where people have value
[22:16] but no clear store of value you tend to
[22:20] go well we better gamble it and
[22:22] especially in a time
[22:24] when we basically have massive
[22:26] uncertainty because you can't
[22:29] without having unless you unless you
[22:32] understand Bitcoin and have really
[22:33] confidence in Bitcoin then you don't
[22:34] have any reason to have any kind of
[22:36] confidence in the future in general so
[22:39] everybody has this kind of underlying
[22:41] Sensation that they really need to like
[22:46] basically YOLO invest all their stuff to
[22:48] make it big because in order to really
[22:51] guarantee your future in the kind
[22:54] of like unless unless like let's say you
[22:57] didn't have Bitcoin right and you you
[23:00] you also you're operating in our
[23:03] existing kind of economic system you
[23:05] you're going to feel sort of insecurity
[23:08] about your future and and the only way
[23:11] to really feel comfortable is I got to
[23:12] make it really rich like if you didn't
[23:14] have Bitcoin the only only other way to
[23:17] kind of get comfortable is going
[23:20] well I got to make tens of millions of
[23:23] dollars that's the only way I'm going to
[23:24] feel like I've got a safe secure future
[23:27] it's just that's how people feel in you
[23:29] know kind of talking across a whole
[23:32] broad range of people but I just think
[23:33] that people are desperate to make it
[23:36] really big because it's kind of an in
[23:39] it's just an economic insecurity that
[23:41] pops up and then and then of course you
[23:43] know we we also have this kind of
[23:45] digital age where you get people get
[23:48] sucked into memes and all this kind of
[23:49] stuff because social media is just like
[23:51] oh when you see when you see other
[23:52] people doing it you kind of want to join
[23:54] the bandwagon so there's kind of
[23:55] multiple effects going on at once but
[23:57] that's kind of why I think it's
[23:58] happening how do you think uh when we
[24:01] are looking out in the future Bitcoin is
[24:04] actually established as a store value
[24:06] maybe even beyond that uh and it's like
[24:09] everyone kind of agrees and it has value
[24:11] and everyone has this understanding of
[24:13] of of of Bitcoin is that safe place to
[24:16] store value um how do you think this
[24:18] will influence Society will those those
[24:21] gamblings those meme coins those uh
[24:24] those short-term thinking actually
[24:26] vanish or is is Bitcoin in of the day
[24:29] just another asset that doesn't
[24:30] influence Society too much no I I do
[24:33] think it will influence society and and
[24:35] it will be both it's not to say like
[24:37] there's some fundamental urges that
[24:38] never go away right so I I it's not to
[24:41] say that people won't be gambling and
[24:42] this sort of thing even in in a Bitcoin
[24:46] world I I I 100% think they will but on
[24:49] the on the margins when you have people
[24:52] that um if you have kind of Economic
[24:55] Security and if you're really confident
[24:58] that you
[24:58] you are going to have a good prosperous
[25:02] life for your family you're going to
[25:05] have safe you're going to have a secure
[25:07] home you're going to have all this kind
[25:08] of prosperity you're going to feel less
[25:12] urgency to gamble and I think and and
[25:15] and and what what that has is it also
[25:18] has a big impact because as you start to
[25:20] feel like less urgent and you do a
[25:23] little bit less gambling yourself then
[25:26] the people around you there's less of
[25:28] that mimic push to push you into
[25:30] gambling because less of your friends
[25:32] are gambling less of everybody else is
[25:33] gambling and so it just kind of reduces
[25:37] that impact on society when you know as
[25:40] one person is impacted the rest of us
[25:42] are impacted because we're all kind of
[25:43] we're so interconnected with each other
[25:46] that the actions of you know you like
[25:50] your actions Robin affect me when I see
[25:52] you do something I it makes me
[25:55] potentially want to do that that's just
[25:56] how humans operate so I do think it will
[25:59] have a big impact on the way we operate
[26:01] for sure it's interesting and I never
[26:04] thought about the impact that Bitcoin
[26:07] has on society because of bitcoiners are
[26:11] being successful when when we have now
[26:14] in in let let's think of a family that
[26:17] has like I don't know 30 people or 20
[26:19] people in there and there's this one
[26:20] Bitcoin guy uh and this one Bitcoin guy
[26:23] all of the sudden does good financially
[26:25] he all of the sudden cares for his
[26:27] health uh cares for his nutrition his uh
[26:30] his Sports and everything like that um
[26:33] it's it's just natural that all the rest
[26:36] of the family members look to him and
[26:39] they're like oh what does he do right
[26:41] like what's what's right with they kind
[26:43] of um assume that there might be
[26:47] something and they uh copy to a certain
[26:50] extent or they get inspired by by his
[26:51] behavior I never thought about that uh
[26:54] thing because they like this this
[26:56] influences Society on a whole different
[26:58] level because that's I guess there like
[27:01] on a big family if there's a big family
[27:03] there's a big chance that there's
[27:05] already one Bitcoin in there I like when
[27:07] we talking about 50 people and I I
[27:09] talked about that in the podcast I my
[27:11] family for example when I started in
[27:14] Bitcoin I was the only one that even had
[27:16] Bitcoin uh and then when the years go by
[27:19] and I talk about Bitcoin a lot U my dad
[27:21] got it my mom got it my my sister got it
[27:25] uh my cousin got it my uncle got it and
[27:27] all of a sudden we're sitting on the the
[27:29] Christmas table and 30 40% of the uh
[27:33] family already has Bitcoin and it's like
[27:35] when then Bitcoin comes up with as a
[27:37] topic uh it's it's it's like an uh way
[27:41] more Snowball Effect it's like than than
[27:43] the other like oh you you all have
[27:45] Bitcoin oh I guess I should also have
[27:47] like some so I don't miss out when the
[27:49] whole family uh gets wealthy and and
[27:51] Rich and I don't like there there's a
[27:53] lot of like adoption and Game Theory is
[27:56] like really interesting for for me uh to
[27:59] to see that how do you how do you see
[28:00] that like when we look at a game theory
[28:02] and and and this whole adoption phase do
[28:05] you have some some predictions here well
[28:08] I do think that one of the things that
[28:13] uh some people don't like about Bitcoin
[28:16] but is objectively true is that because
[28:20] of the nature of it it does it just
[28:22] benefits the people that getting that
[28:24] buy it first like it was better to buy
[28:26] 10 years ago than today been better to D
[28:29] by today than in 10 years time and so
[28:33] because of that that's just like a
[28:36] fundamental nature of Bitcoin because
[28:39] it's deflationary money it's increasing
[28:40] in value over time and
[28:43] so because of that kind of game theory
[28:46] you have a situation in which people are
[28:49] incentivized to be first micro strategy
[28:52] is the first company to take Bitcoin and
[28:54] have this kind of Treasury treasury uh
[28:57] strategy with it
[28:58] and what you see is now there are kind
[29:00] of other companies kind of aping the
[29:02] strategy or following it and they're
[29:05] going to do well but they're not going
[29:06] to do as well as micro strategy because
[29:08] micro strategy was the first one to do
[29:10] it and they did it years earlier and
[29:12] just that's the nature of it and micro
[29:14] strategy were buying at $10,000 a big So
[29:17] you you're going to have a situation in
[29:19] the future where like well you already
[29:22] have a situation where El Salvador early
[29:24] adoped and and they're going to benefit
[29:27] from from having gotten in earlier but
[29:31] what happens is that when we're going to
[29:33] start to see eventually we'll see the
[29:36] first country to print money to buy
[29:40] Bitcoin that's going to be a big deal
[29:42] when that happens and then the in the
[29:43] first one to do that they're going to
[29:46] really benefit and the second one will
[29:48] still do well and the third one but you
[29:50] don't want to be lost you you just you
[29:53] just don't want to be lost and that's
[29:54] the kind of the game theory element of
[29:57] if you you understand that because by
[30:01] its nature it's deflationary it's
[30:03] growing in value forever so it's going
[30:04] to be around in the
[30:06] future then it's like oh it's better to
[30:09] buy it if as soon as you accept that
[30:12] you're going to be allocating to it in
[30:13] the future you want to front run it
[30:16] actually that's what you want to do you
[30:18] as soon as you accept that I'm going to
[30:20] buy it in 10 years time I'd rather buy
[30:23] it today than in 10 years time and and
[30:24] and everybody's kind of grappling with
[30:26] that right now and it does create kind
[30:28] of uh weird incentives where you know
[30:32] people have this like like if you're a
[30:34] bitcoiner you kind of heavily
[30:36] incentivized to have a very high savings
[30:38] rate right now probably much higher than
[30:41] you otherwise would have but you sort of
[30:44] know that realistically like it's better
[30:47] for me to save a lot now than in the
[30:50] future because the savings I have now
[30:53] the purchasing power is just much
[30:55] stronger today um and it's actually kind
[30:57] of opposite Game Theory incentives of
[31:00] sort of kind of the I guess the
[31:02] classical Financial inflation system
[31:04] where everything is incentivizing you to
[31:07] spend get rid of all your cash you know
[31:10] like that's that's the kind of the
[31:11] system we have right now like getting as
[31:13] much getting as much credit card debt as
[31:16] you can getting as much debt as you can
[31:18] spend more than you really have today
[31:22] because it won't that that spending will
[31:24] be kind of devalued over time that's
[31:27] that's what an inflation system is but
[31:28] we have the Bitcoin is the opposite in
[31:31] it by its nature so it just changes our
[31:33] Behavior our incentives thank you you
[31:35] already made it halfway through the
[31:37] video and I'm really really grateful to
[31:39] have you here two things make this
[31:41] channel possible you as a watcher and
[31:44] listen who keep supporting this Channel
[31:46] and another one is all the Bitcoin
[31:48] brands that I partner up with like 21
[31:51] Bitcoin who support me from the very
[31:53] start and where I personally buy my
[31:55] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[31:57] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[31:59] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[32:02] simplest and securest way to secure your
[32:05] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[32:07] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[32:10] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[32:13] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[32:16] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[32:19] and you know your friend does not have
[32:20] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[32:22] he needs a birth of present and a small
[32:24] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[32:26] 5% off your order plus you support my
[32:30] channel and now let's get back to the
[32:32] video I would not also Bitcoin kind of
[32:34] incentivized to to get some credits and
[32:37] Loans out to buy more Bitcoin now when
[32:40] we know like oh fat will fat will not be
[32:42] worth anything and I take a loan out for
[32:45] like maybe 20 years time and uh I take a
[32:48] big bet on on bitcoin I see a lot of
[32:51] bitcoiners even doing like those kind of
[32:54] a
[32:54] stuff yeah in some sense it does um the
[32:58] the only thing is that you have
[33:01] to weigh up your kind of like you know
[33:06] your sort of an individual's utility
[33:08] function is not just it's not just
[33:11] maximized by like the EV of their
[33:15] Bitcoin Holdings you also have to sleep
[33:17] at night you also have to deal with the
[33:20] like handle the volatility in the stress
[33:22] of Bitcoin is volatile and it fluctuates
[33:24] and you don't you don't want to be
[33:26] underwater and then have to sell your
[33:29] Bitcoin at a loss and so that's why like
[33:33] the loans idea uh if we were kind of
[33:36] unemotional creatures like purely
[33:39] mathematical it it can be a good
[33:41] strategy but the problem is is that if
[33:44] you're going to freak out when you when
[33:46] you take out a loan to buy Bitcoin and
[33:47] then and the price drops and then you
[33:49] you freak out it doesn't work uh so
[33:52] that's that's that's the kind of the
[33:53] problem with that idea but it can work
[33:55] for certain individuals if they're wired
[33:58] that way and you know they have like the
[34:00] income stream to comfortably pay off
[34:02] their debts and this sort of thing you
[34:04] know for an individual it could work but
[34:06] it's also
[34:07] um it's like it's very specific to the
[34:12] individual I think yeah I myself uh did
[34:15] it but I kind of I came to this
[34:18] conclusion it's um way
[34:21] more it it's better more relaxed and and
[34:26] a better way of life when you just have
[34:28] your income and what you do for a living
[34:31] and you're being really good in that you
[34:33] just save it in Bitcoin because I was
[34:35] 120% in Bitcoin now I'm like 104 I'm I'm
[34:39] finding my way back to like 90 95%
[34:42] something like that to have some sort of
[34:45] buffer to the 100% but uh it it does not
[34:49] it does make sense like it it definitely
[34:51] made Financial sense for me uh to do it
[34:54] and it it it still pays off um but the
[34:59] like when we just look at financial side
[35:01] it's it's it's a good thing to do long
[35:03] term uh obviously uh because Bitcoin
[35:06] performs very good long term but the the
[35:09] side that you mentioned like you have to
[35:10] sleep at night you have to deal with
[35:11] that uh there are monthly payments that
[35:14] you have to to bring in and when you
[35:16] just have like um a savings with Bitcoin
[35:20] and you don't have this monthly payments
[35:22] of of credits or something like that um
[35:25] it's it's a way better feeling you you
[35:27] you feel way more free and and and this
[35:30] is a feeling that like it's way more
[35:33] worth than a little bit more money maybe
[35:35] in five years so like I think that's
[35:38] that's that's my Angle now even though I
[35:40] did it but now I I kind of get rid of it
[35:44] yeah I I I think I think
[35:46] that's I think that's right like from a
[35:49] mathematical perspective being operating
[35:52] at like 115% or whatever it's probably
[35:55] that's probably better but it's not NE
[35:57] better for your
[35:59] life yeah so that's that's actually how
[36:02] I would say definitely um how do you see
[36:05] actually um Bitcoin because right now
[36:08] Bitcoin is still seen in the mainstream
[36:11] media as this small speculative asset
[36:16] that might be something or might not be
[36:18] something that's bad for environment or
[36:20] it's not bad for environment there all
[36:21] this this things out there uh and it's
[36:24] it's slowly slowly progressing and
[36:26] slowly slowly getting
[36:28] uh on the adult table of the of the side
[36:31] like in Christmas I think um who made
[36:34] that Alexandro ovani made that
[36:36] comparison like Bitcoin moved from the
[36:39] kids tables to the adult table now and
[36:41] is is playing on the on the big scene
[36:43] now um where do you see like Bitcoin
[36:47] going forward as the what what is the
[36:49] role of Bitcoin in the financial Market
[36:51] in like 10 20 50 years uh will it be the
[36:55] base layer of everything or where do you
[36:57] see Bitcoin going well I think it's a
[37:01] it's foundational store of value uh and
[37:04] and in that sense it could be it could
[37:07] easily be without really um being
[37:10] anything too different to what it is
[37:12] today we might see a world in which
[37:15] Bitcoin is worth 10% of everything it
[37:17] just not even if it's like not all that
[37:20] different to today but just foundational
[37:23] store of value um in the same way that
[37:27] you know realistically that's like we
[37:29] have our kind of our stock market we
[37:31] have all these passive flows into into
[37:34] the into the you know S&P 500 and this
[37:37] isn't really people kind of trying to
[37:40] buy stocks because they happen to like
[37:43] particular companies or want to invest
[37:45] it's because they have a paycheck and
[37:47] they just take 20% and throw it at a you
[37:49] know throw it into a box a store of
[37:51] value box and that store of value box
[37:55] has historically been the Vanguard
[37:58] passive you know Index Fund but actually
[38:01] Bitcoin is just a better invest it's a
[38:04] better investment vehicle for that so I
[38:06] think
[38:07] that one one sort of potential way this
[38:10] world goes is you just see more and more
[38:12] people use Bitcoin as a savings tool and
[38:14] it kind of fulfills that store of value
[38:17] role what's what's kind of really
[38:20] interesting is whether you know
[38:21] bitcoin's potential to become like money
[38:25] like actually an actual currency that
[38:27] people
[38:28] use that's really difficult to predict
[38:30] because you're trying to figure out kind
[38:33] of two
[38:35] major trends like systematically you
[38:37] have you have sort of a tech
[38:40] technological you need to have a thesis
[38:42] about whether some kind of Layer Two for
[38:44] Bitcoin is is going to work like a
[38:46] lightning Network or potentially um you
[38:51] know maybe Bitcoin is just tacked onto
[38:52] the existing Fiat system and you have
[38:54] literally just using like Visa rails for
[38:57] trade a kind of paper Bitcoin
[39:00] essentially but what but we know that
[39:04] Bitcoin sort of has its own like
[39:06] limitations from a sort of Bas layer
[39:09] perspective that it's not going to be
[39:10] traded as we're not going to be using
[39:12] Bas layer Bitcoin to be trading like
[39:15] buying coffees with because it's just
[39:16] fees are too expensive it just doesn't
[39:18] doesn't work so there's you that that in
[39:21] itself is like almost impossible to
[39:23] predict and then of course we also have
[39:26] a political situation where if if a
[39:28] government is going to tax you every
[39:30] time you spend it that's going to make
[39:32] things difficult as soon as a if
[39:34] governments come out and say we're going
[39:35] to treat it like a currency not like a
[39:37] property so you can spend Bitcoin move
[39:39] Bitcoin around well that will that will
[39:42] immediately start the you know trigger
[39:44] the use catalyze the use of Bitcoin as a
[39:46] currency much more than it is today so
[39:48] there's like multiple factors going on
[39:50] at once which I don't I mean it's fun to
[39:54] like kind
[39:55] of you know shoot the over but it's
[39:58] also like it's kind of impossible to
[40:00] predict but I don't think it really
[40:02] matters from our perspective in terms of
[40:05] like you know e either way I see Bitcoin
[40:09] going up 100x over the next decade you
[40:12] know or so it doesn't really matter
[40:17] well you get what I'm getting at right
[40:20] like maybe it's not going to 100 x over
[40:22] the next decade but
[40:23] certainly a m like it's it's just the
[40:28] investment thesis doesn't really change
[40:29] it's still massively uh obvious
[40:32] asymmetric bet regardless
[40:35] of kind of what happens to it as a
[40:37] currency unit I guess is what how I
[40:39] would put it yeah and I think the the
[40:41] massive price appreciation is in the
[40:43] store of value
[40:45] story when it then also becomes a media
[40:48] of exchange and and and unit of account
[40:50] this is also great uh brings other
[40:53] benefits but I think like when we have
[40:55] like price appreciation to 100% let's
[40:58] just have the scale I think 90% of the
[41:01] price appreciation and going up is
[41:03] because people store the value in there
[41:05] and not exchanging with one another so I
[41:08] think like the biggest runup uh is is
[41:12] the store value faces I guess and there
[41:15] a interesting thing because of taxes I
[41:19] for example would ask in every
[41:21] restaurant if they accept Bitcoin I
[41:23] would spend my Bitcoin everywhere if
[41:25] they would not be in tax and bit
[41:28] like if if there would not be uh like
[41:30] right now in Austria it's different from
[41:32] every count there's a
[41:34] 27.5% tax on bitcoin profits for example
[41:37] if I bought Bitcoin th000 and then now
[41:41] it's it's 2,000 and with those 2,000
[41:43] Euros I want to buy I don't know a small
[41:45] motorcycle uh then I get I have to pay
[41:48] this €2,000 for the motorcycle but
[41:51] additionally I have to pay
[41:53] 270 and5 in in taxes which is really not
[41:57] fun to spend 200 extra EUR just for
[42:01] taxes so I think just for my personal
[42:04] view I'm all in Bitcoin I only have
[42:07] feared because there are no tax
[42:10] implications uh and maybe because it's
[42:12] shortterm not as volatile as as as
[42:15] Bitcoin in in in in a really shortterm
[42:19] uh uh site so I would spend Bitcoin like
[42:23] crazy because I can just spend and
[42:26] replace uh it this doesn't matter with
[42:29] like a lightning wallet uh then there Al
[42:31] the fees are not really there if if I
[42:33] just use a lightning wallet where there
[42:35] are no fees um I I would love that world
[42:38] and I would love to to bring Bitcoin
[42:40] adoption and and awareness to the world
[42:41] but and if the tax implication is just
[42:44] not practical right um and also you
[42:49] know where is most of the capital being
[42:51] stored is being stored in these kind
[42:53] of endowment Sovereign wealth funds
[42:56] these sort of things they don't it's not
[42:58] it doesn't need they're not uh it's not
[43:01] it's not
[43:03] for money purpose in terms of currency
[43:06] purposes it's sitting there you know you
[43:09] have you have a country that has a
[43:11] hundred billion dollar Sovereign wealth
[43:12] fund they don't need they don't need
[43:16] like they're not holding it in currency
[43:18] anyway they're not then that 100 billion
[43:20] isn't sitting in US Dollars it's sitting
[43:22] in invested assets the reality is most
[43:25] of even if you don't own Bitcoin most
[43:27] most of people's savings are not in
[43:29] currency anyway they're sitting in their
[43:30] house or maybe the stock market so you
[43:34] know payments would be great if we if we
[43:36] can kind of unlock that and I think that
[43:38] it's
[43:40] um you know like an extremely worthwhile
[43:43] thing for people to
[43:45] pursue um but we'll see we'll just see
[43:49] how that plays out it's just really
[43:50] unclear right now yeah I think in the
[43:53] medium term it's it's more like in the
[43:56] medium term I feel like Bitcoin is more
[43:58] replacing real estate as an investment
[44:01] and replacing ETFs as an investment
[44:03] especially ETFs uh in Austria people are
[44:06] crazy about real estate and and ETFs as
[44:08] an uh way of storing the value and it's
[44:12] it's more like that a different question
[44:14] um how do you see when we have ETFs when
[44:18] we have coinbase when we have all those
[44:20] different players and most people
[44:22] actually have their Bitcoin on Exchange
[44:25] uh or with some f party uh in bit brag
[44:29] um the treasure CEO said it's only 2% of
[44:33] bitcoiners who are actually having their
[44:35] own Keys which was shocking for me that
[44:38] it's that low I I thought it's like more
[44:40] like 10% but 2% was was was shocking for
[44:43] me um what was what is the future of
[44:46] self custody will will everybody um or
[44:49] like a big percentage of of of people
[44:52] actually do the self- custody or is like
[44:54] everyone with a Bitcoin bank and and
[44:56] self is really only for the outliers uh
[44:59] yeah I I suspect it I suspect it's
[45:01] that's that's the latter yeah and I do
[45:03] think that um I think that people that
[45:07] are
[45:08] capable of of taking responsibility to
[45:11] self- custody it's a it's a great thing
[45:13] for them there like a lot of benefits to
[45:15] it but with that being said there are
[45:17] trade-offs as well and putting aside
[45:20] what an individual should do I think
[45:23] that you have to look at um the reality
[45:25] is that most the capital is stored in
[45:30] institutions and the concept of self-
[45:32] custody for an
[45:34] institution it doesn't really make sense
[45:37] anyway it's frankly irrelevant and what
[45:40] I mean by that is just take this kind of
[45:43] Wisconsin pension fund well they' bought
[45:46] this Bitcoin but and and yeah it's being
[45:49] held by
[45:51] coinbase but you know via VIA this ETF
[45:54] so coinbase the custodian but here's the
[45:56] thing if you
[45:58] are a pensioner if you're a client of
[46:01] this Wisconsin pension fund you're not
[46:04] cing the bigcoin yourself regardless
[46:06] like even if the Wisconsin you know the
[46:08] board of wi Wisconsin pension fund they
[46:11] were the ones you know where we believe
[46:13] in self- custody and we're going to set
[46:15] up a seven of 12 multisig to custody the
[46:18] Bitcoin themselves well that's cool but
[46:21] the PE the people that actually have
[46:23] ownership of that Bitcoin they're not C
[46:25] they're not they don't have self-
[46:26] custody anyway so there is no actual
[46:30] concept you know self custody is
[46:32] relevant for individual but once you go
[46:35] beyond an
[46:37] individual it's it doesn't really matter
[46:40] anyway there's no it's impossible to
[46:42] have a group of 50 people self you know
[46:46] or 10,000 people invest in a vehicle and
[46:48] have them all be self- custody it's just
[46:50] not a concept that even makes sense or
[46:53] is even relevant so I don't think it
[46:55] frankly
[46:58] matters like self- custody for
[47:00] institutions I don't see as an important
[47:02] issue I do think I would like to see
[47:05] more custodians like I would love to see
[47:08] I I think it's great that
[47:10] Fidelity uh they custody it themselves
[47:14] and I think that you know some other
[47:16] ETFs are using bitgo as a custodian and
[47:19] I do think it's healthy to
[47:21] see a diverse pool of
[47:25] custodians because we don't want a
[47:27] situation where we're just using
[47:29] coinbase's ledger to man manage it right
[47:32] so I think that's a that's a problem if
[47:33] it's everybody's using the same
[47:36] custodian but I don't see really any
[47:38] issue at all with institutions custody
[47:41] their like like the concept of Bitcoin
[47:44] Banks or full institutional investment
[47:47] capital I don't see any problem with
[47:50] that um
[47:52] because
[47:54] fundamentally when it's this kind of
[47:56] pulled Capital anyway there is no there
[47:59] is no uh self- custody and it's Bitcoin
[48:02] is serving a different purpose there the
[48:04] purpose of Bitcoin for these kind of
[48:06] Investments it's it's the it's not the
[48:09] freedom money aspect of it it's it's the
[48:12] investing attributes of it it's the fact
[48:14] that you know it protects you from
[48:17] inflation that's what that's what
[48:19] matters not because you can take it
[48:21] cross border that's not why a pension
[48:23] fund is investing in it so that's where
[48:26] that's kind of my view on it really yeah
[48:29] it's interesting when we look at you you
[48:32] see the danger of of the honey in
[48:36] coinbase is will that decentralize a
[48:39] little bit when people like I feel like
[48:41] most of them did it because it was most
[48:44] like more likely the the S approves the
[48:47] ETF and they do it with coinbase I feel
[48:49] like that was kind of the story uh do
[48:51] you think they they will actually move
[48:53] to self custody like self custody
[48:55] institution level or to go with
[48:56] different providers yeah I do think the
[49:00] uh custodial ship of it will diversify
[49:04] over time because it be get more
[49:05] competitive as an industry uh but I I I
[49:09] think that the reason why coinbase got
[49:12] all the clients because they've already
[49:14] like this is a publicly traded company
[49:17] they already are audited regulated
[49:20] everything about them is you know
[49:22] they've just done a lot of the work in
[49:23] advance to set up to set up the like the
[49:27] necessary uh kind of protection you
[49:29] would require from an Institutional
[49:31] grade custodian so I think that's why
[49:34] they get they got all the clients
[49:37] um but you know yeah I do think it would
[49:39] be better like
[49:42] longterm I'd like to see more
[49:45] custodians and different and I I I would
[49:48] hope that I do think it would be
[49:50] problematic if and not I I don't at all
[49:53] foresee this well but I you know we
[49:56] don't want to see a situation in which
[49:58] everybody like all all these kind of S&P
[50:01] 500 companies go yeah we need a Bitcoin
[50:03] treasury Reserve strategy and they all
[50:05] use coinbase as their custodian I think
[50:08] yeah we want to see that diversify of
[50:10] course
[50:12] but I think that's going to happen
[50:14] anyway yeah before we come to the end
[50:16] routine uh we talked a little bit about
[50:17] about price targets I read somewhere in
[50:20] in the research I I don't remember where
[50:22] that you also have a price Target in
[50:24] 2030 with 3.5 million do do do you uh do
[50:28] you still have that or or like because
[50:30] you said like price Target is more like
[50:32] an indication how bullish you are not
[50:34] like really that price like at that that
[50:36] date yeah look I I I don't have any kind
[50:39] of specific number it's 10 10 years out
[50:42] not really um I do think
[50:46] that you you can kind of have I think
[50:50] the way to kind of come up with these
[50:52] price targets is to use um a range of
[50:56] models and ideas basically like I I like
[51:00] to look at a lot of models and kind of
[51:03] use that as a base idea so you
[51:07] know people like for example there's
[51:10] like when I look at like the power law
[51:12] and the power law says Bitcoin will be a
[51:14] million dollars in 10
[51:16] years I'm not a power law Maxi I look at
[51:20] that and go oh yeah that like that you
[51:23] know in in my kind of mental space
[51:26] potential models that's one model that
[51:28] has that at that valuation there but I
[51:30] can also go H may maybe Bitcoin is just
[51:34] you know it's gold it's just the gold
[51:36] okay well that that if Bitcoin is just
[51:38] gold what's gold going to be worth in 10
[51:41] years and Bitcoin kind of matches that
[51:43] and how do how does that valuation look
[51:45] and where does that play out or how you
[51:48] know what's the total Financial assets
[51:50] will there be in in the entire world and
[51:53] how much of that will be Bitcoin and
[51:55] that that's another mod I try and use
[51:57] like a ton of different models kind of
[52:00] you know in a bearish and a bullish and
[52:01] a base case or whatever but in any in
[52:04] any kind of model that I would have for
[52:07] Bitcoin I do think Bitcoin will be you
[52:10] know measuring it in in dollars but I
[52:12] think it'll be seven figures in in in in
[52:14] in a decade's Time the whether it ends
[52:17] up being a million or 10 million and
[52:21] there kind of like a lot of factors at
[52:23] play that kind of make that like very
[52:24] hard to predict but honestly once it
[52:27] gets to a point where it's such an
[52:29] obvious no-brainer like there's no uh
[52:32] there's nothing like it that's sort of
[52:34] competing it's the best asymmetric
[52:36] investment opportunity so it doesn't
[52:39] really matter you know what I mean it
[52:40] just doesn't change your kind of
[52:42] decision tree at that point if if there
[52:44] was s of
[52:46] um like something competing with Bitcoin
[52:49] that was like oh this thing could
[52:50] actually outperform well that may maybe
[52:52] then you have to like try and refine it
[52:53] but it doesn't matter I mean if if if if
[52:56] like if if Bitcoin is if you told me
[52:59] Bitcoin is a million at the end of the
[53:01] decade or you told me it's 5 million I'm
[53:03] still going to put all my money in
[53:04] Bitcoin like what you know what I mean
[53:07] like it doesn't matter
[53:08] so not too not too worried about it uh
[53:12] very cool I have kind of like the almost
[53:15] the same thing I you I never did a price
[53:18] prediction and I get that ask a lot in
[53:20] the DMS oh what do you expect on a on a
[53:23] base case the Bitcoin average anal
[53:26] growth will be in the next 10 years and
[53:27] I'm like I don't even want to calculate
[53:30] that because like why what what what
[53:33] would I sell it for like why should I
[53:35] spend my mental power in in making all
[53:37] those predictions for the future if if I
[53:40] don't even consider that asset if I
[53:42] consider other assets then I have to
[53:44] look at it uh but if I don't consider
[53:46] like it it makes little to no sense it's
[53:49] fun to do and it's entertaining to to
[53:52] speak about um and it's if if you have
[53:54] the time and if you want to do it like
[53:56] go for for it but I find I I I
[53:58] personally like don't find any any value
[54:01] in that yeah I I think where the the
[54:04] value would come if if you were kind of
[54:07] modeling it and it was the question was
[54:10] is Bitcoin going to do you know if you
[54:13] had a worldview where it was like I
[54:15] think Bitcoin is going to do CPI plus 6
[54:18] or it's going to do CPI plus
[54:20] 9 if if you were if you're in that kind
[54:23] of world then it's like important to
[54:25] model because that's kind of how you
[54:26] figure out what your allocation should
[54:28] be but if you think it's going to do CPI
[54:32] plus 30 or CPI plus
[54:35] 60 it doesn't matter like you're going
[54:37] to invest in it anyway
[54:40] so yeah that's kind of how I look at
[54:43] absolutely and then uh let's come closer
[54:46] to end routine uh the question that I
[54:48] ask now every one of my guests is uh
[54:51] what are you currently passionate about
[54:53] besides Bitcoin like what are you
[54:55] learning passionate about do
[54:56] uh which
[54:58] has little to no nothing to do with
[55:01] Bitcoin yeah sure well look I mean uh
[55:04] well I mean I I I have a like a strong
[55:07] passion for I guess Fitness and lifting
[55:10] and I I mean I I always have I think
[55:12] that's that's like a really important
[55:14] part of my life um setting up like
[55:17] working on for uh starting a family
[55:20] right now so trying to learn as much as
[55:22] I can about uh being a parent um and and
[55:27] and and like this this sort of thing um
[55:31] I also just
[55:34] um I like to learn learn new new skills
[55:38] when it comes
[55:39] to uh anything I can do really for um I
[55:44] guess yeah I like making videos or um I
[55:50] kind of like learning about like
[55:51] algorithms like learning about how
[55:54] Google works and Lear learning about X
[55:56] works and learning about this sort of
[55:58] thing um really you know I will say
[56:01] although it's Bitcoin and work is kind
[56:04] of all um I mean this is this is like
[56:08] what I'm already focused on but I spend
[56:09] much of my life thinking about how we
[56:12] can kind of uh improve what we're doing
[56:15] you know we have a daily newsletter
[56:17] where we where we focus on these Bitcoin
[56:20] flows and you know I want to make that
[56:22] like the best possible newsletter
[56:25] possibly do so that's kind of spent a
[56:26] lot of time just thinking about thinking
[56:28] about that and and ways we can uh you
[56:31] know grow and and also just make it the
[56:34] best possible product so that's kind of
[56:36] where I spend the majority of my time
[56:38] yeah it's it's fascinating for me how
[56:41] many times family comes up in that
[56:43] question when I ask Bitcoin as like
[56:45] family is like I think probably the most
[56:48] common answer and and I love to love to
[56:50] see that family is a big thing for
[56:52] Bitcoin H let's come to the endro team
[56:54] where the previous guest is asking a
[56:55] question for the next guest without
[56:57] knowing who actually the next guest is
[56:59] uh and this is an interesting one uh
[57:01] that you got uh from the previous guest
[57:04] how do you foresee the Bitcoin Community
[57:07] influencing the upcoming presidential
[57:09] election oh that's a great question uh
[57:11] well I mean I think I think we're
[57:13] already we're already seeing it I think
[57:15] that Trump trump is pressured
[57:19] essentially to take a pro Bitcoin stance
[57:21] and he's doing that and I think that's
[57:23] fantastic for Bitcoin cuz you know up
[57:27] until 2024 we haven't really had a a
[57:30] Bitcoin champion and uh I would I would
[57:33] hope to
[57:35] see you know in in future elections
[57:38] maybe both sides are pro Bitcoin or it
[57:41] becomes an issue about who's more Pro
[57:43] Bitcoin um but certainly right now at
[57:45] least it's kind of a wedge issue in in
[57:47] this election where you're seeing one
[57:50] one one's taking the stance of being pro
[57:52] Bitcoin and I do think it's going to
[57:53] have a big impact because you know we've
[57:56] seen Biden veto this this Bitcoin bill
[58:01] which would have allowed Banks to
[58:02] custody and lend against land against
[58:04] Bitcoin and if you're going to vote if
[58:06] if Bitcoin is an important issue for you
[58:09] you can't vote for Biden I mean I I say
[58:11] that as someone like you know if if if
[58:14] other things are important to you okay
[58:15] maybe you can but if Bitcoin is your
[58:17] issue then you can't vote for Biden
[58:20] because he's patently terrible for
[58:22] Bitcoin relative to the alternative so
[58:25] that's that's say clear as like they he
[58:28] they've sort of that's a clear
[58:30] demarcation in terms of how it's going
[58:33] to line up for this election I think
[58:36] yeah I also think so
[58:38] like but in general like I I saw a
[58:42] debate
[58:44] unfortunately I also saw that Meme where
[58:46] they compared the Obama uh presidential
[58:51] um debate from 2012 with the one now it
[58:54] it was very funny um I just I just it's
[58:58] it's great that I'm in Europe and don't
[59:00] have to vote in America uh that that's
[59:03] what I say would be would be hard for me
[59:06] but I definitely also feel like that if
[59:08] if you really if you're a single issue
[59:10] voter and I am one um you have to
[59:13] basically want vote for TR Trump now
[59:15] like Biden is definitely not the pro
[59:17] candidate and there might be Robert
[59:20] Kennedy Jr uh um but then you also have
[59:24] to think like how
[59:26] How likely is it that he wins um if you
[59:29] don't want to do the Strategic uh voting
[59:32] you just go with with maybe with Robert
[59:34] Kennedy Jr um but yeah like I'm just
[59:38] glad that I don't have to do this but
[59:41] I'm I'm Still Envy of America uh because
[59:44] uh in Europe there was also election
[59:47] there was the EU election and it was in
[59:50] completely you it was like beginning of
[59:51] June and there was no word of Bitcoin
[59:54] not from any candidate there was nothing
[59:56] so in America at least it's a at least
[60:00] it's an a topic I I could not even
[60:02] figure out who's the pro Bitcoin
[60:04] candidate in Austria for the EU election
[60:06] I wrote all the papers uh that they put
[60:10] out all the things that they put out
[60:12] from every party and we have in in
[60:14] Austria five uh that that come in and
[60:17] none of them even mention crypto or
[60:21] Bitcoin or anything like that uh they
[60:24] mention inflation but they go ahead and
[60:26] talk about the
[60:28] war and not about money debasement and
[60:30] not about Central Banking so I was kind
[60:33] of disappointed honestly because in
[60:36] America at least it's a debate at least
[60:38] they're speaking about it at least
[60:40] there's one two candidates they that
[60:42] they are forced to speak about it it's
[60:44] they they W how is it actually you're in
[60:46] Australia right how is it there yeah uh
[60:48] no it's Australia is very similar to
[60:50] Europe so I I I do think that America is
[60:54] I agree with you there's at The Cutting
[60:56] Edge
[60:57] of uh technology and Bitcoin uh and
[61:02] freedom and all you know and has been
[61:04] has been it's leading and you know we
[61:06] can laugh at the fact that they've got
[61:09] two 80-year olds competing to be
[61:10] president but uh honestly we have to be
[61:14] envious of a lot of what America has
[61:17] because there's a lot to be desired
[61:20] about I mean I think that it's clear
[61:21] that Bitcoin is a big issue for in
[61:26] America in particular and then they also
[61:28] you know America is leading the way on
[61:30] AI and you know when you look at like
[61:32] Australia and Europe you have to say
[61:34] what are you guys doing what like what
[61:37] are you doing because we you know we we
[61:39] don't have really anything it's all
[61:41] coming out of America so we can you know
[61:43] laugh at the stupid stuff we see them do
[61:46] and there's a lot of that too but you
[61:49] know when you look at the actually um if
[61:52] you want to be optimistic about the
[61:54] world and look at all the big
[61:56] important stuff that is also coming as
[61:58] good it's not coming out of Europe it's
[62:01] not coming out of Australia either uh
[62:03] it's all coming out of America so um you
[62:06] know you take the good with the bad yeah
