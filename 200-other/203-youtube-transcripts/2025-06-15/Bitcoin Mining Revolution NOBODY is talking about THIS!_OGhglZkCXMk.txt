[00:00] it is really an important step to do and
[00:02] to have the option to be your own bank
[00:05] would you trust Bitcoin if the code
[00:07] itself wouldn't be open sours mining
[00:09] these days is not decentralized not even
[00:11] close it is totally centralized you have
[00:14] like three big parties 95% of all mining
[00:16] equipment out there is end Miner what if
[00:18] China as a government now wants to say
[00:20] hey guys you need to update your
[00:21] firmware and you need to put in this
[00:23] specific code which is actively forcing
[00:26] X it's totally possible what would be
[00:28] the case that we can actually
[00:30] decentralized mining back again we need
[00:32] more pools do you say in the last couple
[00:34] of let's say 2 3 years it got more
[00:37] decentralized or more centralized like
[00:40] definitely
[00:41] [Music]
[00:45] centralization what is the better to do
[00:47] on a Saturday than speaking about
[00:49] Bitcoin great it's the only thing that
[00:52] matters to be honest absolutely Bitcoin
[00:54] is the Bitcoin is the only thing that
[00:56] matters I think that's the perfect
[00:57] starting point for's podcast
[01:00] uh how did you come to that that or do
[01:02] you actually think that that Bitcoin is
[01:04] like the the the main thing that that's
[01:05] the most important thing that we we
[01:07] could dedicate our time to us I mean
[01:11] initially I started looking into Bitcoin
[01:14] back in 2012 and back then I was like hm
[01:18] what's this kind of magic internet money
[01:19] it's floting around there I have my resp
[01:21] pie I had one of the early Bitcoin as
[01:24] minus the keno butterfly it was a
[01:28] completely Mass the distribution tion
[01:30] back in the days but it was quite funny
[01:33] getting into it and then I lost track
[01:35] for four or five years and then I
[01:37] started going into it back again in 2016
[01:42] 17ish and I really quickly recognize for
[01:46] myself that it is really an important
[01:49] step to do and to have the option to be
[01:52] your own bank basically to do anything
[01:56] you want with your money and nobody can
[01:57] restrict you
[02:00] so that's the reason why I do think it's
[02:02] uh the only thing that matters like I
[02:04] had it a friend of mine started the
[02:06] online business and was selling bit AES
[02:08] for example and two weeks in he got a
[02:11] notification from his online shop uh
[02:14] distributor that he's now being
[02:17] denied uh accessing like the online
[02:21] payment things because of selling
[02:24] Bitcoin equipment and I was like what
[02:25] the heck is going on this is crazy like
[02:28] how come with Bitcoin this would never
[02:31] happen that yeah absolutely it's it's a
[02:33] it's a beautiful thing where you have um
[02:36] I always bring that example of air PTC
[02:39] is already completely Bitcoin only so
[02:41] they don't pay in Bitcoin they don't
[02:43] take they they don't pay in feed and
[02:45] they don't take fear so they only are
[02:47] Bitcoin and then it's like you have a
[02:49] website and everything is Bitcoin so
[02:52] nobody can deny you the the service
[02:54] which is amazing thing and you really
[02:57] big on open sourcing uh Bitcoin mining
[03:01] uh that's at least the the first
[03:03] impression that I got when I saw your
[03:04] profiles I mean you could say so uh yeah
[03:08] I'm really I'm really big into open
[03:09] source in general like there's the term
[03:11] Foss which means free and open source
[03:13] software uh there's also the term fos so
[03:16] free and open source hardware and I got
[03:21] into a project named Bitcoin uh bit
[03:23] EGS two years ago and uh it kind of
[03:27] intrigued me it was kind of weird cuz
[03:31] back in the days when I started becoming
[03:33] a software developer and I studied
[03:34] business computer science and now I'm a
[03:36] software developer for for B company and
[03:39] yeah it was kind of a thing for me to
[03:42] produce code and do something for the
[03:44] greater good of everybody not only for
[03:46] myself or for a company that you're
[03:47] working with but out of a sudden I was
[03:50] watching YouTube lately in in the on the
[03:54] couch and I was just chilling there and
[03:55] I saw someone posting a video about nerd
[03:58] eggs like these small screens like these
[04:01] screens here where I can just put on
[04:03] some mining firm you have a beautiful
[04:05] screen you can watch the Bitcoin price
[04:07] and I was in TW I was like that sounds
[04:09] interesting I never really thought about
[04:11] the possibility of creating your own
[04:13] Bitcoin mining hardware and a couple
[04:16] days later I found about the project
[04:19] bidex and I got intrigued into that
[04:22] because it is completely different from
[04:24] what's available currently on the market
[04:26] we only do have like three different
[04:29] manufactur
[04:30] that produce proprietary hardware and
[04:32] software uh we have bitmain which is the
[04:35] LGE largest manufacturer when it comes
[04:37] to bitcoin equipment on the mining side
[04:39] then we have Avalon which is sort of its
[04:42] own thing and we do have microbt the
[04:45] what's Miner and sure we do have a
[04:48] couple more that are now rising up on
[04:50] the market but that's basically it and
[04:52] you do you don't have any option to
[04:55] actually verify what's going on and a
[04:58] funny thing about that is is back in
[05:01] 2012 I believe 2013 somewhere is this
[05:05] date uh there was a not a bug but a
[05:08] feature from bit main called endplate
[05:11] and this allowed them to actually
[05:13] remotely control or shut down the
[05:15] devices wherever you set them up and it
[05:18] was discovered by the community back in
[05:20] the days and it sort of comes into the
[05:24] same state of what we're trying to
[05:26] approach these states like I'm now from
[05:28] the community open source miners United
[05:30] this one here we have developed the bitx
[05:34] the small Bitcoin miner which is
[05:36] completely open source on the hardware
[05:38] level and the software level and we will
[05:41] intend to do that forever we we are not
[05:44] thinking about changing anything of
[05:45] producing stuff that is proprietary
[05:48] because we want to give back the option
[05:50] for the people to get into Bitcoin not
[05:53] only on like hey I can use this for my
[05:55] daily uses buying goods and everything
[05:57] use it on lightning and whatsoever but
[06:00] also understand or understand the core
[06:04] etos behind it like we have the mining
[06:07] site which is one pillar we have the
[06:09] note side which is one pillar and we
[06:11] have the transaction side which is the
[06:13] third pillar and I usually do compare
[06:16] all three together but the the truth
[06:19] about it is nothing would work without
[06:21] the other so the complete house if you
[06:25] call it like that around Bitcoin would
[06:27] collapse if one of these pillars would
[06:29] fall apart and having a market where 95%
[06:35] of all mining equipment is from
[06:37] proprietary Hardware manufacturers or at
[06:39] least I need to say 99.9% because we are
[06:42] so small now but changes are coming and
[06:47] uh we need to do a change we need to
[06:49] rise the or raise the awareness of the
[06:51] people that there is not only the thing
[06:53] of yeah you plug in a machine and you
[06:55] trust it no you can actually verify it
[06:57] which is the eers of Bitcoin don't trust
[07:00] verify and the other the three main
[07:03] devices they are all closed
[07:05] source so when you do compare it to
[07:08] other things like the bitmain miners or
[07:12] the whats miners or what else is out
[07:14] there there is nothing else than the
[07:16] bidex that is open source and to be to
[07:20] be clear here the bidex device itself is
[07:22] open source but there is one proprietary
[07:25] hardware part on it which is the a chip
[07:27] which is produced by bitm so what we did
[07:30] initially to figure out how to work with
[07:32] it is we actually reverse engineered the
[07:35] AC chip we figured out how to use it how
[07:38] to send commands over it how to give it
[07:40] the correct voltage and everything that
[07:42] it needs and then we worked our way
[07:45] through it to actually figure out how to
[07:47] use it so the bdex itself is open source
[07:50] and we have published everything on
[07:52] GitHub we have our own wiki page on u.
[07:56] Wiki where I can actually go into it and
[07:58] you can take a on what what's on this
[08:01] device how does it work how can you
[08:03] utilize it so basically everybody could
[08:06] now just purchase chips from bit Main
[08:08] and build their own device because we
[08:09] have reverse engineered the chips sort
[08:12] of not on a physical level but on the
[08:14] software level we know how to send them
[08:17] commands and we know how to work with
[08:19] them we don't know how to produce them
[08:21] but the good thing is we have high hopes
[08:23] for the upcoming open source Asic SHP
[08:25] from blocks just it's and for me it's uh
[08:29] super interesting because I always
[08:31] looked at that kind of it it's the the
[08:34] only fishy part about Bitcoin where you
[08:37] have those bit big Bitcoin mining pools
[08:40] where basically like free dominating the
[08:43] the the market and you also have then
[08:46] the the hardware side of it where you
[08:48] also said already that's like basically
[08:50] free uh device um manufacturers that do
[08:53] all the things um that I always looked
[08:56] at like the the biggest problem within
[08:58] Bitcoin Bitcoin is still like the by far
[09:00] the most decentralized and safest thing
[09:03] uh ever um but nothing is 100% uh I
[09:07] would say um how what what is the actual
[09:10] attack Vector um if for example uh an A
[09:15] or like those kind of Manufacturers are
[09:18] getting coopted or something like that
[09:20] uh or differently asked how important is
[09:24] open sourcing Bitcoin mining to not 1%
[09:28] Bitcoin mining is open but like maybe 40
[09:31] 50 60% in the future open source how
[09:34] important is that for someone that is
[09:36] just holding Bitcoin in in in in his own
[09:39] self custody solution I me the question
[09:41] that you need need to ask yourself is
[09:43] basically what would you trust Bitcoin
[09:46] if the code itself wouldn't be open
[09:48] source and that's the whole EAS about
[09:51] the whole project like Bitcoin was
[09:53] initially proposed to the world as an
[09:56] open source project everybody can verify
[09:58] it everybody can change it can do
[09:59] whatever you want you can create a
[10:00] shitcoin if you want to but nobody would
[10:02] care there are plenty of other
[10:05] implementations or other implementation
[10:07] that utilize the Bitcoin code for
[10:09] example we do have Bitcoin core as a not
[10:11] site we do have the Bitcoin knots as a
[10:14] not site so there are a couple different
[10:16] implementations of it and that's the
[10:18] whole part about it if you do hold
[10:20] Bitcoin yourself as just for whatever
[10:22] purpose you want to do just to store
[10:24] value or what you're intrigued in sure
[10:28] that's the thing but
[10:30] if you ever want to transact anything on
[10:32] chain and you want to do a transaction
[10:34] to another party how does this work you
[10:38] need the mining side you need the
[10:39] transaction side and you need the note
[10:41] side so we're back again to our three
[10:43] pillars and initially or usually when I
[10:46] do go for example to any conferences or
[10:48] anything else I I try to St my speeches
[10:51] with a question to the people ask
[10:53] yourself if you attend to any sort of
[10:55] event have you ever heard about Bitcoin
[10:58] mining sure you do have probably but ask
[11:01] yourself again have you heard about how
[11:03] this works and there's the funny part
[11:06] usually when you go somewhere and when
[11:08] you try to get resources or information
[11:10] about things especially around Bitcoin
[11:12] where it is a keen and an high interest
[11:15] that you do understand what you're using
[11:17] there because in the end it's your money
[11:20] you're trying to spend something you're
[11:22] trying to use it to buy Goods or
[11:23] whatever or store value that's whatever
[11:26] purpose you do prefer to use it for but
[11:30] you try to get information about the not
[11:32] side you try to maybe get some privacy
[11:35] information but why don't you get into
[11:37] mining because there's not enough
[11:39] information that's the whole point and
[11:41] people are undervaluing the mining side
[11:43] of it and that's what we are in our
[11:45] community trying to change we're trying
[11:46] to change the awareness of mining in
[11:49] general we're not there to get all these
[11:52] big parties away we are totally aware
[11:56] about the fact that getting like big
[11:58] mining farms and fac facilities and
[12:00] companies out of the market is these
[12:02] days basically impossible but the
[12:04] important part here is to give the
[12:06] people that actually using Bitcoin as
[12:09] their daily driver the option to get
[12:12] more information and everything in the
[12:14] open source manner as Bitcoin was
[12:16] intended to be and that's the thing so
[12:18] should then everyone run their own uh
[12:21] small mining Hardware at home I mean
[12:25] it's it's a thing uh usually it is
[12:28] completely
[12:30] it is hard to answer because the thing
[12:32] is of course we do have the bidex it is
[12:34] a one as6 chip device which with the
[12:36] latest revision that we do have the bitx
[12:38] scamma which utilizes the newest Asic
[12:40] chip from bitmain you can reach up to
[12:43] 1.2 ter at like default settings you can
[12:46] overclock it over two ter but usually
[12:50] when people think about mining they do
[12:52] think about I need to get daily revenue
[12:54] and that's also another point that we're
[12:57] trying to point out here mining these
[12:59] days is not decentralized not even close
[13:03] it is totally centralized we you have
[13:05] like three big parties just do yourself
[13:08] as like a viewer later on in this video
[13:10] do yourself a favor go to mempool click
[13:12] on the mining s and take a look which
[13:14] are the three biggest pools now you do
[13:18] understand we're really close to getting
[13:19] into centralization or we are even there
[13:21] currently that's the thing like we are
[13:24] so far apart from decentralization and
[13:26] that's what needs to be changed so so
[13:29] when you would ask me should I run a
[13:31] bitx at home just for the purpose of
[13:33] earning daily a couple of sets I sadly
[13:36] need to answer that's probably not going
[13:37] to happen because most of these pools
[13:39] that you do can connect to they do have
[13:41] a threshold on which kind of amount you
[13:44] can pay out these Bitcoin or these sets
[13:46] over to your uh utxo and therefore there
[13:50] is this issue of how can I use it um
[13:56] what we usually do recommend to the
[13:58] people is use it as a solo Miner try
[14:01] yourself your luck and uh earlier this
[14:04] year someone was lucky let me quickly
[14:06] look over we had the block 853 742 I do
[14:10] have it 3D printed out there on the wall
[14:12] I can show this later maybe and uh yeah
[14:15] this block was found by by a bid eggs on
[14:17] the CK pool which is a solo pool and
[14:20] that's that's the thing about it
[14:22] currently solo blocks are really really
[14:23] rare because everybody is trying to
[14:25] combine their hash rate and find a block
[14:28] but if you do take a look on the Block
[14:29] pool or on the pool distribution we do
[14:32] have Foundry which is the biggest pool
[14:34] because it is like many facilities
[14:36] combined to one pool we do have anend
[14:38] pool we do have uh brains we do have
[14:43] other pools as well and most of them are
[14:45] even proxies which is also a thing like
[14:49] you look at you look at manool and you
[14:51] think all right here we go we do have
[14:54] mol VI PTC F2 pool and so on and you do
[14:57] think oh we we're kind of decentralized
[15:00] we do have plenty of different pools but
[15:03] if you're really honest to yourself and
[15:05] if you do a little bit of investigation
[15:07] and I highly recommend everybody who is
[15:09] listening to this do yourself a favor on
[15:11] a there is a account called
[15:14] b10c which uh is a dude who is
[15:16] absolutely amazing he's working on
[15:18] meo.de
[15:20] and uh he did a little bit of research
[15:23] on which pools are actually proxy pools
[15:25] what do I mean by that it's really
[15:27] simple and pool is basically the main
[15:29] pool and if you want to start yourself a
[15:32] smaller pool like brains pool or SEC
[15:36] pool uh you do not have enough hash
[15:40] power to actually pay out regularly to
[15:43] the people that are mining to your pool
[15:45] so what do you need to do you need to
[15:46] connect your pool to a bigger pool such
[15:49] as an pool which is called a proxy pool
[15:51] so it appears to be that you are your
[15:54] own pool but indeed you're not you're
[15:56] mining to another Pool and you can
[15:58] clearly ident ify this on chain so this
[16:02] actually phases into the issue that
[16:04] we're seeing these days that mining
[16:06] decentralization is not there and with
[16:09] the whole project around bid eggs and
[16:11] open source minus United because it's
[16:13] not only bid EGS we also do have other
[16:15] mini mining devices that we created
[16:18] there are so many we do have our own
[16:19] Discord server but I can't name all of
[16:21] them currently it's just too many our
[16:25] idea here is not to force you into solo
[16:28] m you can do whatever you want that's
[16:30] the whole purpose it's open source you
[16:32] can verify it you don't need to trust us
[16:34] I even recommend you not to trust that
[16:37] build the source code on your own and
[16:39] build the the firmware on your own with
[16:41] the source code everything is on GitHub
[16:43] if you don't like it change it if you
[16:45] have a request then request it and maybe
[16:48] we we put it into it uh that's that's
[16:51] the whole purpose of about open source
[16:53] development and yeah I mean mining in
[16:57] general needs to be on a on a side where
[17:00] people get back the power and not big
[17:02] companies because you asked me initially
[17:04] and I was talking way too long about all
[17:06] the other topics here what if there is
[17:10] like a big pool or mining manufacturer
[17:13] mining Hardware manufacturer and he's
[17:15] now being forced by his regulation or
[17:17] something else into a specific area it
[17:20] totally could be the case I mean imagine
[17:23] 95% of all mining equipment out there is
[17:25] end Miner what if China as a government
[17:27] now wants to say hey guys uh you need to
[17:30] update your firmware and you need to put
[17:31] in this specific code which is actively
[17:34] forcing X that's totally possible it is
[17:39] possible but that's what we're trying to
[17:42] fight here we're trying to fight these
[17:44] possibilities that no government can
[17:47] come after you and you're not relying on
[17:49] propriatary source code that you cannot
[17:53] verify I heard about other projects too
[17:56] um I I unfortunately my bitco commanding
[17:59] uh especially the technical side of it
[18:01] is is not my expertise but this allows
[18:04] me to to ask all the beginners questions
[18:06] uh that probably most of the audience
[18:08] also has I heard about other projects
[18:10] like ocean Mining and datum also how
[18:12] does this fit in that whole picture so
[18:16] the idea about ocean and I hope I recall
[18:19] it correct here is we do have the main
[18:22] purp the main issue here that we do see
[18:24] I've already explained it that pool
[18:26] decentral decentralization is not there
[18:29] so what would be the goal or what would
[18:30] be the case that we can actually
[18:32] decentralize mining back again we need
[18:36] more pools and that's what ocean is
[18:38] trying to do here and that's that's the
[18:41] thing ocean is a nice pool you can you
[18:44] can connect your miners to it you can
[18:45] also connect your pit eggs to it if you
[18:47] want to you can enable lightning payouts
[18:50] there because they do have a threshold
[18:52] on how much Bitcoin you need to
[18:54] accumulate before they do an onchain
[18:56] transaction to you and if you cannot
[18:59] fulfill this threshold you can always
[19:01] activate the lightning payout it's a
[19:03] little bit complicated on how to do it I
[19:05] did like a small go through tutorial on
[19:07] my YouTube channel it's not that
[19:08] detailed so I need to probably do
[19:10] another one again about it but you do
[19:13] get the point you now have another
[19:14] option but ocean is not the solution we
[19:18] need more that's the thing and then is
[19:21] also this new thing called datum which
[19:24] is like an implementation of a couple of
[19:26] things of stratum V2 from Ocean
[19:29] which basically allows you to host your
[19:31] own node at home for example with a
[19:33] start n node and you just Implement
[19:35] datum on which is basically just a thing
[19:38] it communicates with your node with the
[19:40] blockchain on your device on your node
[19:42] at home and you create the block
[19:44] templates yourself but ocean still needs
[19:48] to accept them so it does not it does
[19:51] not solve a truly decentralized
[19:54] decentralized vision of mining it is
[19:57] better but it's not there where we need
[19:59] to go would you say in the last couple
[20:02] of um let's say two three years uh it
[20:05] got more dentalized or more centralized
[20:08] like where where is the trend currently
[20:11] going in in Bitcoin mining definitely
[20:14] centralization I mean take a look we do
[20:16] have so many companies and that's also
[20:18] the catch that I usually do tell to the
[20:20] people that are attending to any
[20:22] conferences anything else if you do
[20:23] think about Mining and you do question
[20:25] yourself what have I heard about mining
[20:28] usually you will only find firms and
[20:30] companies in front of you who are
[20:31] telling you hey you can host your mining
[20:33] machines with us come to us and host
[20:36] with us we are a big company in Kenya in
[20:39] the United States and you can host your
[20:41] mining equipment with us the biggest
[20:43] issue obviously is these machines are
[20:44] big loud and they consume a lot of power
[20:47] so it is not really feasible to run them
[20:49] at home and that's where we try to
[20:52] change it a little bit as well like you
[20:54] don't need to purchase yourself like a
[20:56] big heavy industry mining device you can
[20:58] go with with a small device like bitx
[21:00] put it up at home and totally forget
[21:02] about it and what's even better you
[21:04] totally forget about it and someday you
[21:06] might even find a block so how cool is
[21:08] that and there's there's only there's
[21:11] this whole thing about bitx that if we
[21:14] do reach let's say 100,000 500,000
[21:18] devices and we're getting closer and
[21:20] closer to this uh to these numbers that
[21:24] we are forcing more more blocks to be
[21:27] mined solo than on PS which is totally
[21:30] what we want to
[21:31] achieve because I said mining is not
[21:36] decentralized and in the last couple of
[21:38] years got even more centralized pools
[21:40] are growing and they don't have any
[21:43] intent to stop that why should they
[21:45] they're making more
[21:48] money I I really like the projects of
[21:51] where we we we mine Bitcoin and use the
[21:54] Heat or use something else from it I
[21:56] really also like there's a bunch of home
[22:00] um projects now there's even like
[22:02] commercial products around that uh where
[22:05] people just like got uh and and Heat
[22:08] their their pool or heat the whatever uh
[22:11] with with the Bitcoin mining not Farm
[22:14] but like the couple of Bitcoin miners at
[22:15] home which is really cool where where do
[22:18] you see that going I see so many
[22:20] different uh Services now there Bitcoin
[22:23] mining is a service where you can just
[22:25] like uh buy a Bitcoin hardare wallet
[22:29] there and they do all the things for you
[22:31] uh and they provide you a nice um
[22:34] overview with that but then also we have
[22:36] more more centralization I guess but U
[22:39] my depends on if you can choose your
[22:42] your pool and stuff like that then you
[22:44] can uh do Bitcoin mining at home with
[22:46] bidx uh you can start your own Bitcoin
[22:49] mining Farm but that's probably for for
[22:51] only a few uh people that can actually
[22:53] do that uh or you can use Bitcoin mining
[22:56] in in heaters like 20 one energy is
[22:59] using the Bitcoin minus and heating you
[23:01] can do your own facilities like there's
[23:03] a bunch of options out there is is it in
[23:05] the future some at some point everything
[23:08] will just mine Bitcoin all the devices
[23:10] that that maybe use heat or something
[23:12] like that is are we coming to that I
[23:14] think it's it's quite funny to actually
[23:17] think about it um uh my honest answer to
[23:20] that would be no and the reason for that
[23:22] is if you do think about Heating and if
[23:25] you want to heat up your home and or
[23:27] your pool
[23:28] you can totally do that with Bitcoin
[23:30] mining there are many solutions of it as
[23:32] you said 21 energy does have the ovens
[23:35] the oven and the oven Pro or whatever
[23:37] and there are other Solutions as well
[23:39] and you can use it to generate excess
[23:43] heat and use it at your home sure that's
[23:45] the thing but that's not how most of the
[23:48] people think about heating most of the
[23:50] people that do care about heating they
[23:52] actually think about how much energy do
[23:54] I need to put in and how much heat do I
[23:56] get out and if you if you talk talk
[23:58] about heating with bitco mining it is
[24:01] like one to one you put in one kilowatt
[24:03] hour of power in it you get one kilowatt
[24:05] of heat out it out of it with other
[24:09] solutions that we do have it's better to
[24:13] be honest that's the thing but I mean if
[24:15] you say electricity is totally cheap and
[24:17] I don't really care about it and I just
[24:19] need this heat anyway or I can reuse
[24:22] this heat for example to heat up my pool
[24:25] it's completely a cool idea especially
[24:27] you do need to change your calculation
[24:30] because now you're earning sets you're
[24:32] making money back
[24:34] so it is hard to calculate everything
[24:37] but I do say the average person the
[24:39] average consumer will not get it so I
[24:43] don't think that's going to be happening
[24:45] but I do think for 10% of the people
[24:49] it's actually viable I mean I'm doing it
[24:52] myself for example this office here is
[24:54] heated completely just uh with Bitcoin
[24:56] miny then like Heating so like
[24:59] everywhere we need heat and um max said
[25:03] that to me uh as some crazy statistics
[25:05] that like 50% of the energy that we use
[25:08] is is directly or indirectly used for
[25:11] heating things uh heating your home uh
[25:15] heating something that you melt plastic
[25:17] or whatever um which is quite a big
[25:20] amount of that uh and if we can only uh
[25:24] replace that energy and incorporate bit
[25:28] mining with that which would be in most
[25:30] cases a no brainer there's so many
[25:32] example of like where apartment
[25:34] buildings um switched out the heating
[25:37] system uh to a Bitcoin mining heating
[25:39] system and they got all of the sudden a
[25:42] surplus of money versus paying for for
[25:45] the heat that's the thing sorry for
[25:47] interrupting you here but I mean take a
[25:49] look over into the Netherlands there is
[25:51] the biggest European paprika Pepper Farm
[25:55] and it's been heated by Bitcoin mining
[25:58] so if you do purchase yourself in Europe
[26:01] a pepper it is likely going to be from
[26:04] this place because it's the biggest
[26:06] Pepper Farm in Europe and it's going to
[26:08] be heated with Bitcoin
[26:09] mining which is quite funny I mean just
[26:12] take a look over at Bitcoin breand I
[26:14] think they are the ones who provided
[26:16] this service or got them up into that so
[26:19] that's totally funny and I totally agree
[26:21] on this point that if you do have
[26:25] something where just need a little bit
[26:26] of heat or where Heat is not the
[26:29] important part about it but you still
[26:30] need it then sure changing it over to
[26:33] Bitcoin mining is a no-brainer but if
[26:35] you're talking about heating your home
[26:37] there are maybe other viable options but
[26:43] it becomes really
[26:44] really difficult to calculate everything
[26:47] as you said it could be the case that
[26:48] you do now have a surplus of money but I
[26:51] mean how long do you actually heat up
[26:53] your home usually do you heat it up to a
[26:55] certain temperature and then
[26:58] yeah you need to hold this temperature
[27:00] I'm not I'm not really into the heating
[27:02] section of everything but I mean I guess
[27:05] it can be quite a little bit tricky with
[27:07] Bitcoin mining interesting yeah I just
[27:09] just looked it up I never I heard that
[27:11] the Pepper Farm it seems to be a real
[27:14] real thing tomato it is totally it is
[27:17] totally real if you do purchase yourself
[27:18] a pepper in Europe it's like 80% it's
[27:22] going to be from this farm and it's
[27:24] going to be heated with Bitcoin
[27:26] money they changed they changed I
[27:28] believe from gas over to Bitcoin mining
[27:30] because gas was so expensive a couple
[27:32] years ago in the Netherlands so that
[27:34] they said all right screw it and Bitcoin
[27:36] B stepped up and said hey guys I have a
[27:38] perfect solution sure you use
[27:40] electricity and it's just a onetoone
[27:42] exchange from electricity to heat but
[27:45] you do have a surplus of money then and
[27:49] yeah there's there's this quick video on
[27:52] a yeah it's uh it's just totally funny I
[27:56] I've been over in the Netherlands a
[27:57] couple weeks ago I did a workshop over
[27:59] there and uh I talked to the guy it's
[28:02] it's absolutely amazing it's just funny
[28:05] and that that's the thing so you said
[28:07] it's completely a no-brainer if you do
[28:09] need it as for example heating our
[28:11] Peppers or tomatoes totally so why not
[28:14] change over there's also another thing
[28:17] we do have big data centers or other
[28:19] things that need to need a little bit of
[28:21] heat we can use heat over there and we
[28:23] can utilize Bitcoin mining for that or
[28:25] if you do have I don't know like you
[28:27] have a a big facility and your workers
[28:30] are working in there and you need to
[28:31] heat it you can do that but we are
[28:34] getting to a point where we do see in
[28:37] the most cases it makes sense on an
[28:39] industrial level not on a home level
[28:43] so I I still stick to my answer that I
[28:46] do think the the average consumer will
[28:49] not change over but that's totally fine
[28:51] maybe you do run your bit EXs at home
[28:53] and you don't care about the hashrate
[28:54] that you're providing and you find a
[28:55] block someday I partnered up with coin
[28:59] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[29:02] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[29:04] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[29:07] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[29:10] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[29:13] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[29:16] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[29:19] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[29:22] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[29:25] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:28] watch collections you have the date of
[29:31] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[29:34] there and of course also the block
[29:36] height and which Epoch we are currently
[29:39] in I love the level of detail they put
[29:42] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[29:45] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[29:48] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[29:50] love those watches so so much if you
[29:54] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[29:56] regular basis I'll guess you already
[29:58] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[30:00] most important step is to keep the
[30:03] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[30:06] wallet my personal recommendation for
[30:07] harder wallet is the bitbox it's super
[30:10] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[30:12] perfect gift for friend who has still
[30:15] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[30:18] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[30:21] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[30:25] robobin to get your bitbox and then next
[30:28] step is to really level up your
[30:30] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[30:32] have the most secure self- custody setup
[30:35] you have to secure your own devices you
[30:38] have to protect your privacy you have to
[30:41] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[30:44] on where you live you even want to have
[30:46] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[30:49] move in case something goes really
[30:51] really wrong and through all those steps
[30:53] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[30:55] step by step and if you isit the Bitcoin
[30:59] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[31:02] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[31:05] how you can level up your sovereignty
[31:09] yeah I mean uh you don't you don't lose
[31:11] a lot of money if you run a bit X right
[31:14] no that's that's totally the thing like
[31:16] I showed this in the camera this is a
[31:18] nerd eggs which is just an iteration of
[31:20] a bit eggs it has another screen the
[31:22] nerd Miner screen here uh but the other
[31:25] thing of it is basically the same as
[31:27] with a bitx it's really this small you
[31:30] just plug in five volts to it and it
[31:33] consumes between 15 to 20 watts of power
[31:36] depending on what settings you set up
[31:38] and then you do have 1.2 to2 Terra has
[31:41] of hash rate you point it somewhere and
[31:43] you do have every day every 10 minutes
[31:45] you have the lottery at home basically
[31:49] that's usually what I do tell the people
[31:51] because honestly speaking about it and
[31:53] making daily returns in sets with it is
[31:56] not feasible and I would recommend it I
[31:58] tried it on ocean with the lightning
[32:00] payout it works but it's it's it's not
[32:04] intriguing for me to actually set it up
[32:05] like that I would totally go for solo
[32:07] and all my equipment that I do have here
[32:09] at home or all these prototypes that I
[32:10] do develop all of them are just yeah
[32:13] just solo Mining and by the way while I
[32:16] said that I need to clarify like I am
[32:18] from U the community open source miners
[32:20] United behind the bitex project but I'm
[32:22] not the inventor the actual inventor is
[32:24] Scott who is basically uh the theator of
[32:28] the bidex project and I'm one of the
[32:30] maintainers and developers on this
[32:32] project so I'm mostly on the software
[32:34] part I do have a little bit of knowledge
[32:36] on the hardware level but that's not so
[32:38] my
[32:39] topic wait so so you tried uh with ocean
[32:42] of the bitx or with like a normal uh bit
[32:47] Bitcoin minor I I I do have one s19
[32:51] minor which is running off of solar in
[32:53] my garage but uh this one is also
[32:57] pointed to Ocean but I didn't try it
[32:59] with this one what I did is I used four
[33:02] normal bit x's and then I used a bit X
[33:04] Hax which is like a little bit bigger it
[33:06] has six chips in it it needs a little
[33:08] bit more Cooling and it draws up to 70
[33:10] 75 watts and produces like three ter
[33:13] something like that uh I tried that I
[33:17] let it run for a couple of weeks I set
[33:18] up my own node I set up my own lightning
[33:20] Channel I opened up uh everything I
[33:23] signed my bold 12 offer and then sets
[33:26] were flying into my account it's as easy
[33:29] as that as it sounds but to be honest it
[33:31] needs a little bit of time and you need
[33:33] to know what you're doing like if you
[33:35] just expect to click a button and it
[33:37] works it's not going to happen you need
[33:39] to do a couple of things maybe even
[33:41] comment line we need to be a little bit
[33:43] more consumer
[33:44] friendly is is the bidx uh the the the
[33:48] best way and the most inexpensive way to
[33:51] to learn about Bitcoin mining totally I
[33:54] mean so here's the catch I talked about
[33:58] the ner minor and if you do think about
[34:00] the ner minor it's just like this little
[34:02] screen which does have a little bit of
[34:03] code on it so that it can run the bit
[34:06] Bitcoin sh 256d algorithm and produce a
[34:10] couple of hashes so it calculates a
[34:11] couple of
[34:12] times this is a fun way to learn it if
[34:15] you want to go into the code and read it
[34:18] and understand how it works but that's
[34:20] not how Bitcoin mining these days works
[34:22] what you need is a AC chip and under
[34:24] this heat sink here there's an AC chip I
[34:27] currently do not have one laying around
[34:28] here but these ones are really tiny like
[34:31] this this size here and that's how
[34:34] mining these days works so what you
[34:37] really want to do is if you are
[34:40] interested in actual bitco mining get
[34:42] yourself a bit eggs they are really
[34:43] cheap these days it
[34:45] started last year was kind of expensive
[34:48] but I I think this year a couple of
[34:51] resetters are down to $99 per device so
[34:54] it's it's inexpensive to get it and
[34:56] learn it and the best part about it it
[34:58] is totally granny proof I call it
[35:01] because you plug it in it opens up a
[35:04] Wi-Fi on the screen it tells you hey I'm
[35:06] ready connect to my Wi-Fi you take up
[35:08] your phone you connect to the Wi-Fi it
[35:10] tells you hey I'm not configured
[35:12] configure me set up my Wi-Fi set up my
[35:15] Bitcoin address click save reboot me
[35:18] boom you're done that's it and then then
[35:21] the more complicated thing that you did
[35:23] is connecting more of of those together
[35:26] what you said is you need a little bit
[35:28] more I mean when we talking about ocean
[35:30] uh and connecting ocean with your BX
[35:33] devices it's as easy as going into the
[35:36] settings of my biex device and point
[35:38] where Point them to an address like I
[35:41] need to point them somewhere and this
[35:44] address needs to give me a work a job
[35:48] and I need to fulfill that so all these
[35:50] devices all that mining equipment can
[35:52] actually do is just receive work process
[35:56] this work and send back an answer so we
[35:58] need a Noe or something like a strum
[36:02] proxy in between to communicate with
[36:04] pools or with servers or with your node
[36:07] and that's basically what datum is in
[36:10] this example so if I would set up my own
[36:12] datum at home I just would point my bit
[36:15] eggs to this and then it would magically
[36:18] work you can say interesting yeah and
[36:21] it's it's uh I probably shouldn't make a
[36:23] a video out of it just purchase one and
[36:25] and and set it up myself would be a a a
[36:28] great uh way of like learning about it
[36:32] myself and maybe also the the people
[36:34] here really cool um when you when we
[36:37] talk about Bitcoin mining it's always
[36:38] for me where uh we we started with GPU
[36:42] Mining and then just like people m a lot
[36:46] of Bitcoin back in the days on their
[36:48] laptops uh is is that something that is
[36:51] still possible is something where you're
[36:54] like you can still run you don't need to
[36:57] purchase the the bit X you can just run
[36:59] it on on your PC if you have a old PC
[37:02] laying around I mean sure you can do
[37:04] that I'm not really sure if you want to
[37:06] do that that's that's the catch about it
[37:08] so Asic the triip that I'm all the time
[37:11] talking about stands for application
[37:14] specific integrated circuit which is a
[37:16] complicated word but the only thing it
[37:18] means is it's a small circuit a small
[37:20] component like you can think about it
[37:22] like as a small tiny CPU which is
[37:24] dedicatedly built just for one task do
[37:29] Bitcoin mining the algorithm that is
[37:32] behind Bitcoin mining sh
[37:34] 256d and that's the only thing it can do
[37:37] if I would send it instructions to hey
[37:39] show me a picture it couldn't do it or
[37:41] if I would send it other instructions it
[37:42] couldn't do it it should it can only do
[37:44] one specific task which is mining the
[37:47] algorithm and yeah so if you're talking
[37:49] about the early days back the days where
[37:52] you had like the Bitcoin software which
[37:54] was not called Bitcoin core Bitcoin Lots
[37:55] or anything else Bitcoin was origin
[37:57] just Bitcoin you had the option like it
[38:00] was a UI thinger you can call it and you
[38:03] had the option to click on stop mining
[38:05] you would start mining on your own note
[38:07] which is running then on your PC back in
[38:10] the days these days it's a little bit
[38:12] different uh but you can still run
[38:15] Bitcoin mining software on your PC I
[38:18] wouldn't recommend it because it's so
[38:19] inefficient as I said like these tiny
[38:22] chips they are truly and only Built for
[38:24] Bitcoin mining algorithms and you see is
[38:27] buil to do other things your GPU is also
[38:29] buil to do other things so in theory yes
[38:33] you could do it but to give you a little
[38:34] bit of comparison if you take like an
[38:36] RTX 3080 and try to mine Bitcoin with it
[38:40] you maybe get 500 meah hases maybe and
[38:46] this one here can do Terra
[38:49] hases so 10,000 x multiplication here
[38:54] so yeah and the power consumption is
[38:56] totally another thing as
[38:58] well obviously it's it's extremely
[39:00] inefficient and you you don't get really
[39:03] uh uh you're very unlikely to get
[39:05] anything out of it basically very
[39:07] unlikely the the lower your hash rate is
[39:09] the the lower is the likelihood of
[39:10] actually finding a block or contributing
[39:13] to the overall system of Bitcoin
[39:16] so it is arguable if the bitx itself
[39:19] makes even sense and we had plenty of
[39:21] people plenty of doubters in the early
[39:23] days that told us hey this is never
[39:26] going to happen will never find a block
[39:28] and out of a sudden we found a block
[39:31] like it is working it's totally possible
[39:33] and the more devices that are coming
[39:35] online and that's the thing the more
[39:37] devices that are coming online and don't
[39:40] care about the hash rate don't care
[39:41] about the government that are truly
[39:43] decentralized somewhere at
[39:44] home you can't put them down if your
[39:47] government doesn't like your company
[39:49] they can put you down and now you need
[39:51] to close up your Bitcoin mining company
[39:53] with bidx this will never happen but but
[39:56] would just to just to clarify the the
[39:59] one that found the block that was
[40:01] completely on its own without the pool
[40:04] so uh there's this big misconception
[40:07] about what a pool is so a pool these
[40:11] days is basically nothing else than
[40:13] someone is running some rare server and
[40:16] you're connecting to it to get work for
[40:17] your Bitcoin mining device that's the
[40:20] only thing it does and now when it comes
[40:22] to mining Solo or in a pool it is
[40:25] basically the same the only difference
[40:27] is if you mine solo your device receives
[40:31] works and if you find a block you
[40:34] get basically the full block reward if
[40:37] you mine to a pool which is still the
[40:39] same we're still mining to someone else
[40:41] server then you would share the reward
[40:44] even though you found the block you will
[40:46] share it accordingly to the amount of
[40:48] work that you put into that
[40:50] block so solo is I find a block I get
[40:54] something I don't find a block I don't
[40:55] get anything p mining there are
[40:58] different payout schemes and this is a
[41:01] complete own topic on its own where we
[41:04] can argue ours about because it's so
[41:07] messed up these days pool is basically I
[41:10] mine to a pool and I get payouts no
[41:12] matter what if I find a block or if I
[41:14] don't find a block so okay so so the the
[41:19] the the one that found it was on its own
[41:21] and got the full block reward or almost
[41:23] the full block reward on it uh for the
[41:26] one thing that running if you run it
[41:28] themselves and you just connect it to a
[41:30] pool you only get a very small amount of
[41:33] of payouts because you only contribute a
[41:35] very small percentage to the pool
[41:37] correct so this particular man was
[41:40] connected to the solo pool of CK pool
[41:43] and CK de behind this pool who invented
[41:46] this pool or wrote the code for it is
[41:48] also the creator of CG minor and uh
[41:52] therefore he's a truly legend in the
[41:55] Bitcoin scene when it comes to mining
[41:56] really cool it's interesting that topic
[41:59] is so it's super interesting because in
[42:01] Bitcoin um I was in Bitcoin before I
[42:06] started the podcast all over three years
[42:09] already and I thought I know quite a lot
[42:12] of things about Bitcoin uh then I
[42:14] started the podcast got to know that I
[42:16] don't know anything about Bitcoin and
[42:19] now I do my 340th episode with you and
[42:23] it's like I I I still have so much to Le
[42:26] especially technical aspect because I
[42:29] think podcasts are hugely uh skewed
[42:32] towards talking about the monetary
[42:34] aspect why Bitcoin makes sense and all
[42:36] those things so I really like getting
[42:38] the other side of things where we just
[42:40] talk
[42:41] about you probably wouldn't even call
[42:43] that talk that talk that we have now a
[42:45] technical
[42:47] talk it's it's it's this thing like as I
[42:51] said usually if you talk with people
[42:52] about Bitcoin they only care about hey I
[42:55] want to run my own note hey I want to be
[42:57] private if I do transfer you funds so I
[42:59] use my own note or how can you make
[43:01] money with it or maybe you want to host
[43:04] your device on my company because I'm a
[43:06] cool company that's it you don't get
[43:07] anything else and this is the crucial
[43:10] part that we're trying to change here
[43:11] with this whole movement I'd like to
[43:13] call it because open source minus United
[43:16] is there for the people and we do
[43:18] everything in public and for them like
[43:20] we are not a company we are not an
[43:22] organization we are just these I I'd
[43:25] like to call it like that these weirdos
[43:27] in the internet who invented an open
[43:30] source Bitcoin miner and that is truly
[43:33] Bitcoin nothing less yeah that's that's
[43:37] that's the true uh Bitcoin EOS
[43:39] peer-to-peer open
[43:41] source do you think that um I talked
[43:45] about that with the block trainer uh do
[43:47] you think that everything is is is
[43:49] coming over the long run to to open
[43:53] source uh as open uh systems are uh
[43:57] Superior long-term over closed
[44:00] systems it's quite an interesting topic
[44:03] in my for example in my bachelor thesis
[44:05] I kind of wrote about the open source
[44:07] theme and if it actually helps the
[44:11] overall economy or not uh
[44:14] it's it's it's wild to answer to be
[44:17] honest because the reason being is we do
[44:20] have plenty of companies who do have
[44:22] schools code that is the only purpose of
[44:25] the comp company if they would publish
[44:27] it they had no purpose because they need
[44:30] to protect it so on this term I don't
[44:33] think that we will see open source in
[44:35] the long run will win over proprietary
[44:37] things but in the community thing like
[44:40] for example Bitcoin I do believe
[44:43] everything that is open source is far
[44:44] more Superior especially we have so many
[44:47] specialists in Bitcoin that could
[44:49] clearly point out any flaws or issues in
[44:51] your code for example let's imagine you
[44:54] now build up the layer 7 solution for
[44:57] whatever on bitcoin and there's some
[45:00] weirdo on the internet pointing out to
[45:01] you hey man there's an issue if you run
[45:03] it like that somebody could steal your
[45:05] money that's not going to happen if you
[45:07] do decide to build proprietary this is
[45:11] only going to be happening if you do
[45:13] build it in an open source Manner and
[45:15] that's the reason why we do it we have
[45:16] the software we have the Hardware open
[45:18] source we have all the projects that we
[45:19] do are open source we even do have our
[45:22] own pool and still I I need to say that
[45:26] again pool is just these days another
[45:29] name for I do connect myself to another
[45:31] server whether This Server pays me out
[45:33] in Solo terms so I do get the full
[45:35] reward or nothing or I share my rewards
[45:38] with other people that's another level
[45:41] so we also created a pool which is also
[45:44] available if you do have an umbrell Noe
[45:46] just go on it and go into the
[45:48] marketplace and search for public pool
[45:51] that is created by open source minus
[45:53] United if you want to run it on your St
[45:56] nine there's also the in the community
[45:58] registry you can download it there it's
[46:01] totally easy so setting up all these
[46:03] things in an open source manner is for
[46:06] us the only choice nothing
[46:10] less are are you confident that we we
[46:13] get uh in Bitcoin long term again with
[46:18] uh decentralizing the uh mining pools
[46:20] and decentralizing the the hardware it
[46:23] is my biggest hope that we do achieve
[46:25] that and the reason for that is purely
[46:28] because I'm feed about what Will
[46:30] governments do if they go onto that
[46:33] train if they hop onto that train
[46:36] because we do see it now more and more
[46:37] governments are interested in Bitcoin
[46:39] some of them don't like it some of them
[46:41] deny it in their regulations or whatever
[46:45] and others are interested in it and what
[46:48] if we now out of a sudden do have govern
[46:50] governments that are interested in
[46:51] mining and forcing mining companies for
[46:53] example into a specific thing now we you
[46:57] have an issue so we need to create
[47:00] something such as our open source
[47:02] project it's just an example I mean you
[47:04] can you can create whatever you want so
[47:06] you don't need to get yourself a bit
[47:08] exgs just build something on its own
[47:11] it's open source we you don't need us we
[47:14] don't need you we we need everybody in
[47:16] the community because that's how open
[47:18] source communities livees but you get
[47:20] the point with open source you can do
[47:23] whatever you want and with regulations
[47:25] and governments it becomes quite quite
[47:28] hard to be honest if we talk about open
[47:30] source and how things are going to
[47:32] happen out in the long run because I do
[47:35] believe that open source in this as I
[47:36] said I do believe that open source will
[47:38] win in the long run especially in
[47:40] Bitcoin if we're talking about other
[47:42] topics I don't know like other companies
[47:45] and source code thingies that are not
[47:47] tied around a economical system maybe
[47:51] they don't need to be open source yeah I
[47:53] mean there's uh where we can see now
[47:57] with Nostra and and social media will be
[47:59] very interesting if Nostra gets to a
[48:03] point uh of being the dominant Social
[48:06] Network right now
[48:08] it's um very small compared to like the
[48:12] Facebooks and the twitters man so much
[48:15] smaller than Facebook yeah it's it's
[48:17] quite rare seeing someone on on Noster
[48:19] who is not a
[48:22] Bitcoin it's it's quite
[48:24] funny it's it's a small n but but it's
[48:27] it's it it could it could work like I I
[48:30] feel like Nostra is an
[48:33] interesting um interesting experiment
[48:36] and uh I like optionality because
[48:38] optionality always brings us to freedom
[48:41] and if we have the the if we have like a
[48:44] spectrum of Freedom where you have on
[48:46] the left side the LinkedIn and the the
[48:49] Facebooks of the world and then in the
[48:51] middle maybe there's like Twitter where
[48:53] it's a little bit more free but there's
[48:55] still censorship going on and then of
[48:57] the right side uh you get to how are
[49:00] they things called Blue Sky and Nostra
[49:03] and all the other social media apps uh
[49:06] or how's that thing from Trump called I
[49:08] don't know truth social or something
[49:11] like that something like that yeah so
[49:12] there are so many things uh I mean it's
[49:15] in social media we really have a lot of
[49:17] options um uh and and that's that's my
[49:21] my main thing is like we have to have
[49:23] the options but I hope that we we get
[49:26] more m main stream do do that do do
[49:29] Nostra and those options and and less on
[49:32] on on the Facebook and Linkedin uh side
[49:35] of things that that's kind of my my hope
[49:37] so maybe we we have um Mass adoption of
[49:40] of Open Source technology in social
[49:42] media and communication and in community
[49:46] uh when they build um uh better user
[49:49] friendlier things and the the learning
[49:50] curve is actually really good because I
[49:52] went into Nostra a year ago I think the
[49:56] app I use was damos I think was the that
[50:00] I used there and I was like ah that
[50:02] doesn't feel good and social media
[50:04] really lives on that it feels good and
[50:07] down boarding is quick and so a lot of
[50:09] people can join and needs that Network
[50:11] effect this year uh people bugged me
[50:14] about this I was like I should try it
[50:15] again and it felt so much better I used
[50:18] Primal and it really feels good uh it
[50:21] really feels like a Twitter uh thing no
[50:24] it does yeah I'm I'm I'm little confused
[50:27] by Primal like I I I always was looking
[50:30] for
[50:31] another relay connector that I could use
[50:35] on my PC but Primal I don't know it
[50:38] feels so buggy to me on the computer I
[50:41] never use it I only use it on the on the
[50:43] App Store I don't know how it's the
[50:45] computer but yeah that that that's kind
[50:47] of my where where I see also like may
[50:51] maybe open source gets to a a good point
[50:54] of uh adoption really cool cool to to
[50:57] also see uh your thoughts around that
[50:59] really cool perfect then we have one
[51:02] question that I asked every each and
[51:04] every one of my guest is what can we
[51:06] learn from you now besides Bitcoin and
[51:09] maybe also besides open source so my
[51:12] main purpose for being out here being at
[51:14] your podcast or even doing my own
[51:16] YouTube channel is only one thing I want
[51:19] to educate and I want to give
[51:21] information to the people because none
[51:24] of these systems would work without it
[51:26] it doesn't matter if it is open source
[51:28] or not or if it is Bitcoin or not but
[51:31] you need information and you need a good
[51:32] place where you can find them and having
[51:35] someone who can actually understand the
[51:38] technical terms and break it down to
[51:39] people who are not a little bit less
[51:42] into these technical topics is I think a
[51:44] crucial part and that's where I do see
[51:46] myself and I'd say learning for myself
[51:49] is never stop learning and always think
[51:54] try about your decision don't try just
[51:56] verify I like that the the Bitcoin eat
[51:59] first and you can lay that in in all
[52:01] your life like the don't trust verify
[52:04] proof of work all those those kind of
[52:05] things
[52:06] everything absolutely really cool thank
[52:09] you so much we have an end routine in
[52:10] the podcast where the previous guest is
[52:12] asking a question for the next guest
[52:13] without knowing who the next guest
[52:15] actually is and your question from the
[52:17] previous guest is if you could orange
[52:19] pill anyone in the world who would it be
[52:21] I could orange P anyone in the
[52:25] world I probably say my son cuz he's
[52:27] only 5 months
[52:30] old he will be orange build right he
[52:33] already does have plenty of Bitcoin
[52:35] socks and
[52:37] everything yeah that's that's super
[52:39] interesting because I think like the uh
[52:41] the kids from bitcoiners they will live
[52:46] they will grow up and think that Bitcoin
[52:48] is normal yes because that's their only
[52:50] thing they know and we see with Samantha
[52:53] from uh from the the she's like I think
[52:57] 13 years old and she was on my podcast
[52:59] and she said like it was so normal
[53:01] because uh her dad always talked about
[53:04] Bitcoin she used Bitcoin so she fought
[53:06] the the world is already on a Bitcoin
[53:08] standard and then she got introduced to
[53:10] Fiat when she was like 11 12 years
[53:14] old F yeah I hope that that's where
[53:18] where we want to be and uh your father
[53:21] can now uh indoctrinate Bitcoin in the
[53:25] Next Generation
[53:27] that's my
[53:28] goal really cool thank you so much um
[53:31] last for for being on uh thank you so
[53:34] much for for taking the time uh yeah
[53:37] before I let you go where can people
[53:38] find you ask your questions and and
[53:40] reach out to you I think you also have a
[53:41] YouTube channel so I'm basically
[53:43] everywhere uh Noster a YouTube I
[53:48] Facebook I don't use Facebook so I don't
[53:49] have that um but all of them just want
[53:52] clue nice want want clue go to want clue
[53:58] yeah perfect then yeah thank you so much
[54:01] L for being on also thank you so much
[54:03] for everyone that is uh watching and
[54:04] listening uh for joining us today as
