[00:00] we could have been the second L Salvador
[00:01] since November and it's just being held
[00:04] back because of this from all things
[00:07] that you have listed it seems like the
[00:09] country is ready for Bitcoin adoption in
[00:11] terms of oil development will actually
[00:13] be one of the richest nations in the
[00:15] world imagine if you could have been in
[00:17] El Salvador before it became legal
[00:19] tender right I'm talking about Bitcoin
[00:22] and Bitcoin adoption and nation state
[00:24] adoption which is uh one of my favorite
[00:26] topics had a lot of people from esav on
[00:29] uh and yeah I hope the Surinam can be
[00:32] the the second El
[00:33] Salvador definitely that is my hope as
[00:36] well um you know even though it wouldn't
[00:39] be bad if another country beats us to it
[00:41] I mean I'd be happy with that uh as well
[00:44] but it would be great if um you know we
[00:47] could be on the map as the second
[00:50] country uh great as so it's like the
[00:52] target for you to to drive the Bitcoin
[00:54] adoption in Surinam so like legal tender
[00:58] Bitcoin mining like what what are like
[01:00] the goals for Surinam or maybe let's
[01:02] let's take a step back because we talked
[01:04] about before um what what is Surinam
[01:07] like what what is the country all about
[01:09] where is it what what language I think
[01:11] Dutch it is uh maybe let's take let's
[01:14] make a quick overview of Surinam the the
[01:16] country for the people that don't know
[01:18] about it sure so Surinam is on the
[01:22] northern coast of South America um or
[01:24] right above Brazil um so you see three
[01:27] small countries you see Guyana uh next
[01:30] to Venezuela and then you see Surinam
[01:32] and French Guyana and then the rest is
[01:34] Brazil it's a very well actually by land
[01:37] mass it's it's pretty big um in
[01:40] comparison to El Salvador for example
[01:41] it's about six times the size don't hold
[01:43] me to that but
[01:45] about um but it's 93% forested um so
[01:49] it's actually pretty small in terms of
[01:51] population uh we have about 600,000
[01:54] people um so it's kind of like a little
[01:57] village uh in terms of size just of the
[02:01] of the population itself we have a
[02:02] pretty small economy 3.2 billion um it's
[02:08] uh it's like stepping back into time
[02:11] into the 1980s a little bit um in terms
[02:15] of technology and financial
[02:16] infrastructure you barely have like we
[02:19] don't have the same debit cards for
[02:21] example that you have in Europe or in
[02:23] the US like what you're used to using
[02:26] right usually it has Maestro or
[02:29] Mastercard or visa on it so your regular
[02:32] debit card uh from the bank works
[02:34] everywhere in the world um in Surinam we
[02:36] have the surinamese dollar um which is
[02:39] our national currency and it we have
[02:41] about 50 to 60% inflation annually um
[02:45] which is very sad but also very good for
[02:48] Bitcoin um but basically you can't use
[02:51] your debit card anywhere in the world um
[02:54] you can only only use it locally and
[02:57] it's at these very archaic um POS
[02:59] systems that don't have NFC so there's
[03:02] no tap to pay um no chip payments um
[03:07] like some debit cards have it not all
[03:09] online banking is a pain uh local
[03:12] transfers like just sending money from
[03:14] person to person takes about one to
[03:16] three business days um on average three
[03:19] if if if it's two different banks um so
[03:23] it's it's cumbersome to just transact
[03:25] here um it's primarily cash-based a lot
[03:29] of people still use cash a lot of people
[03:31] prefer uh foreign currencies over
[03:35] theames dollar because of that inflation
[03:37] so they tend to save in either US dollar
[03:39] or Euros um most Apartments most um real
[03:45] estate transactions are still done in
[03:47] Euro or US Dollars um so most people
[03:50] don't even pay their rent or um you know
[03:54] buy a house or whatever in
[03:56] SRD um so it's it's it's still a lot of
[04:00] hedging that's happening just naturally
[04:02] into foreign
[04:04] currencies um we have a very beautiful
[04:08] Amazon rainforest mountains River Rapids
[04:13] waterfalls um it's just beautiful to see
[04:16] uh the biodiversity specifically as well
[04:19] it's a lot of untouched Amazon
[04:21] rainforest and we have um indigenous
[04:24] tribes of Maroons and um just Native
[04:28] Indians and and they still live um you
[04:32] know very much as they've lived for the
[04:34] last hundreds of years um so that is
[04:37] really great to
[04:39] see and uh we have our city is like
[04:44] um yeah how do I explain this our city
[04:47] is not really a city like it it's not or
[04:50] it's not a city like you know in the
[04:52] general sense um so our city isn't
[04:56] really um a city in the like you you'd
[05:00] be used to in in Europe or any other
[05:03] country it's um it's very small it's a
[05:09] UNESCO heritage site actually and it's
[05:11] still all the old buildings from the
[05:14] colonial times when the we were still a
[05:16] Dutch Colony um so it's all wood it's
[05:19] all very old um it is it is
[05:22] maintained um but it's all one story Max
[05:27] two stories you know you don't have
[05:29] skyscraper ERS or big concrete buildings
[05:32] here so it's it's all a lot of nature
[05:35] it's actually really fascinating to see
[05:38] and we have amazing Wildlife we have um
[05:41] you know leatherback turtles coming here
[05:43] every year to lay their eggs and breed
[05:45] and um then the hatchlings uh going out
[05:48] to see um that's a beautiful thing to
[05:50] see as
[05:51] well and yeah there's a there's since
[05:55] 1975 since we've gained our independence
[05:57] there's been a lot of uh government
[06:00] corruption because we have a vast amount
[06:04] of Natural Resources we have a lot of
[06:07] gold and aside from gold we also have
[06:10] oil
[06:11] onshore and offshore oil deposits and
[06:14] offshore oil is estimated to be more
[06:16] than Qatar so in terms of oil
[06:19] development will actually be one of the
[06:21] richest nations in um in the world uh
[06:25] over the next decade so a lot of
[06:28] resources but not as much development
[06:32] flowing back to the people or to you
[06:35] know just into the economy there's a lot
[06:38] of theft by government a lot of
[06:39] corruption a lot of um fraud a lot of
[06:42] scandals every year almost um every
[06:45] other month or every month uh one comes
[06:48] out um so people don't trust government
[06:50] people don't trust the central bank
[06:52] people don't trust the banks um the
[06:56] average interest rate for a mortgage
[06:58] here is like 12% if you're lucky and you
[07:02] have um a uh a foreign currency income
[07:08] and if you don't in SRD it's about 18 to
[07:10] 19% so just imagine paying that as a you
[07:13] know as as your monthly uh to to be able
[07:16] to buy a house so a lot of restrictions
[07:19] uh we don't have a capital market so
[07:23] what's Satoshi buil Bitcoin for that
[07:25] whole system of centralization and then
[07:28] you know how it being as riged as it is
[07:30] in international Capital markets uh we
[07:33] have no Capital Market whatsoever it is
[07:36] a laptop going around with an Excel
[07:39] sheet um once a
[07:41] month yeah so that's how he that's how
[07:43] he trade stocks um so it's it's um it's
[07:48] there's a big gap in terms of Technology
[07:51] development and and financial
[07:53] infrastructure but that also creates a
[07:56] unique opportunity because we have a
[07:58] very small population of only 600,000
[08:01] about 240,000 live in the city um so we
[08:05] have small communities that are just
[08:07] primed for adoption and we have the the
[08:12] lack of financial infrastructure and the
[08:13] lack of um you know just the the simple
[08:16] things that you take take for granted in
[08:18] in the US or even in El Salvador in El
[08:20] Salvador they already had pretty easy to
[08:23] use Financial infrastructure before they
[08:25] adopt the Bitcoin as legal tender we we
[08:28] don't even have that here here so the
[08:30] use case is even better than than El
[08:33] Salvador you can literally show them you
[08:36] know with wall of Satoshi of blink if I
[08:38] orange pill someone and I show them how
[08:39] it works they're just like mind
[08:42] blown so creates a unique opportunity
[08:45] for Bitcoin ad option here um we've been
[08:49] working on a Bitcoin C for the last year
[08:52] and I've been working on pushing for
[08:54] Bitcoin ad option here for the last six
[08:56] years um it was was an uphill struggle
[09:02] but it's it's gotten a lot easier ever
[09:04] since El Salvador actually um you know
[09:07] with with blink coming out with um
[09:09] easier to use user-friendlier wallets
[09:12] it's it's a lot easier for people to
[09:14] learn how um how easy it is to use
[09:18] lightning and this this the main part of
[09:20] Bitcoin adoption like uh one country
[09:23] does it uh for the second country it's a
[09:25] little bit easier than the first country
[09:27] and that there's like this Snowball
[09:28] Effect going on
[09:29] uh and in fascinating country like what
[09:32] I noted done is like it's half this
[09:34] population of Vienna uh but like 20 exra
[09:37] size or something like that because it's
[09:38] like uh a lot a lot of forests and from
[09:42] all things that you have listed it seems
[09:45] like the country is like ready for
[09:47] Bitcoin adoption like let's let's have a
[09:50] Bitcoin standard there and especially
[09:53] when you think about the dominance of
[09:56] the US dollar and the Euro because what
[09:59] when you basically use the US dollar and
[10:01] the Euro what you're doing is like you
[10:04] are importing the inflation that other
[10:06] countries are doing in their currency
[10:09] like when the US dollar is uh devalued
[10:12] because they invest in their own country
[10:14] they invest in their own stuff they
[10:16] exporting inflation in all the other
[10:18] countries that are using the US Dollars
[10:20] there like 66 countries or something
[10:22] like that that actually as the official
[10:24] currency used them and there are other
[10:26] countries like suram that are kind
[10:29] have the official currency with the Euro
[10:32] and the dollar where the most of them
[10:35] like to use them instead of the surum
[10:38] dollar uh which is fascinating for me um
[10:42] this is kind of like I wanted to ask you
[10:44] what motivated you to to get into
[10:47] Bitcoin uh but it basically was that
[10:50] situation that you saw in Sur now
[10:53] right well it's it's one of the reason
[10:56] why I wanted to push for adopt or why I
[10:58] want to push for adop option here um
[11:01] because I when I read the white paper I
[11:03] was like okay this is the holy girl this
[11:05] you know it's going to be huge um and
[11:09] that was around 2012 um but I still was
[11:12] a little bit you know holding back like
[11:15] okay let's see where it goes is it going
[11:17] to get some traction is it going to
[11:19] increase um like is the network uh going
[11:21] to increase is it going to scale um and
[11:24] how will the technology develop over
[11:26] time um but just because I was also
[11:29] obsessed with tech stocks from an early
[11:31] age and then just the Capital Market in
[11:34] in you know growing up and
[11:39] I you you kind of learned that markets
[11:42] move in Cycles when you start early on
[11:44] and then you know you know when the next
[11:47] recession or about when the next
[11:49] recession according to that cycle is
[11:51] supposed to come and if you you know if
[11:54] you know what to look for then you kind
[11:57] of already knew that 200 was
[12:00] coming and it came like exactly as as as
[12:04] planned on time and then reading the
[12:08] white paper you kind of realize like
[12:09] holy this is the solution this is
[12:12] what we need and that is kind of how I
[12:15] like
[12:16] just how I how I transitioned from okay
[12:20] this is what we need to fix the problem
[12:22] in the US to like okay this is what we
[12:24] need to to fix everything and Su
[12:26] basically because we don't have the
[12:28] payment infrastructure we don't have
[12:30] Capital Market infrastructure we don't
[12:32] have much of of what you already have in
[12:35] in developed Nations so I I saw it as an
[12:38] opportunity for our country to develop
[12:41] on a Bitcoin standard so on on the
[12:44] latest technology and you know it's the
[12:47] the payment layer on the internet and I
[12:51] I just see I just already saw it as as
[12:53] the future and I I went completely all
[12:56] in in 2017
[12:59] and just haven't looked back since then
[13:02] amazing uh and how does like the current
[13:07] officials the current government the
[13:09] current uh people you said there's a lot
[13:12] of scandals going on a lot of
[13:14] Corruptions they probably don't like
[13:16] Bitcoin that much how do how do they
[13:19] react to to those Bitcoin proposals and
[13:22] that Bitcoin could be a solution for
[13:24] their
[13:25] country well actually we had so we had
[13:28] genan 3 here in November uh Samson and
[13:31] and Ben F came here and um they had
[13:35] conversations with industry Leaders with
[13:37] the banking commission with the Central
[13:39] Bank um with uh the president and the
[13:43] Minister of Foreign Affairs and the
[13:45] president in the meeting said he wants
[13:47] to be a global leader in terms of
[13:49] Bitcoin technology and adoption he wants
[13:51] to follow the example of El Salvador and
[13:54] he wants to push for you know attracting
[13:57] foreign investment and in talented into
[14:00] the country and he was actually very Pro
[14:04] Bitcoin adoption and he said his uh
[14:07] presidential advisor has to evaluate
[14:11] jre's proposal and then based on that
[14:14] they you know they would proceed and
[14:16] then it it looked like things were
[14:18] taking like long way too long than they
[14:22] than they should and I'm I'm very well
[14:25] connected here just because of you know
[14:27] my companies I'm an Entre R preneur here
[14:29] in the country I've been for uh 21 years
[14:32] so I have a broad uh Network in the
[14:35] private sector the financial sector and
[14:37] also directly to these politicians so I
[14:41] actually
[14:43] contacted uh the chairman of eov uh who
[14:47] is the the president's advisor um
[14:49] shortly after Samson came and I had
[14:52] asked him you know um uh what's the hold
[14:57] up like why is it taking so long this is
[14:59] something that could have been done in
[15:01] like two to three days why is it taking
[15:03] so long and then he informed me that he
[15:06] was mining
[15:08] Bitcoin um that he had personally
[15:10] invested 20 million into mining Bitcoin
[15:13] at bham uh for about and had reserved 20
[15:17] megawatts uh in electricity and was
[15:19] already mining 10 megawatts and that he
[15:23] didn't want the public opinion of of
[15:27] Bitcoin to to taint what he was doing
[15:31] and he didn't want it to be publicly
[15:33] known that he was mining he wanted to
[15:34] keep it small and silent and um you know
[15:39] I thought okay let's just let the
[15:41] government do their thing it's you know
[15:43] it's bureaucracy they need to install a
[15:46] payment commission that needs to
[15:48] evaluate and and it's just regular
[15:50] bureaucracy so I gave it some time and
[15:53] then I kept getting uh more information
[15:58] on this mining site and how it was
[16:02] structured uh like I I received uh a
[16:05] notice that there was a uh a meeting at
[16:08] the Ministry of Finance with the
[16:10] Minister of Finance and uh our Energy
[16:13] company on this specific topic this mine
[16:17] and then it was still silent after that
[16:19] nothing happened so I started to you
[16:22] know like more red flags and and
[16:24] questions started popping up and I kept
[16:27] receiving more information about this
[16:29] mine and then I think it was two two
[16:33] weeks ago two yeah two weeks ago a month
[16:36] ago I did a podcast about it and then I
[16:38] received more information and then since
[16:40] it started about two weeks ago that I've
[16:42] been on TV a lot and uh on local uh
[16:45] media a lot about this mine because
[16:49] apparently he's been mining at a rate
[16:52] that is similar to only one private
[16:55] company and that is the rosabel gold
[16:57] mine so he's mining at the same rate as
[17:00] the Rosel gold mine in private he's not
[17:04] paying any taxes or anything on it and
[17:06] he's been mining since April
[17:09] 2022 and the worst part is they've
[17:13] increased prices since last year for you
[17:17] know just regular retail use and Retail
[17:19] users in a country where people can
[17:21] barely afford to to survive at this
[17:24] point while this man is mining with sub
[17:28] subsidized energy and you know that the
[17:31] whole point of my proposal because I was
[17:33] a part of e-government in 2020 he he
[17:37] recruited me in in egov specifically for
[17:40] the development of the capital market
[17:42] and the exchange and for Bitcoin
[17:44] adoption and I pitched this to him I
[17:47] told him we should start mining Bitcoin
[17:49] as a strategy for the country we should
[17:52] start um you know it's it's a way to
[17:54] convert SRD into Bitcoin and get more
[17:57] foreign Capital into the country country
[17:59] and directly into the hands of
[18:01] people and he just went and he did it
[18:04] privately without anyone like the public
[18:07] has no idea nobody knew that he was
[18:08] doing this since April
[18:11] 2022 and now it's just kind of blown up
[18:14] and I'm a a whistleblower here so
[18:17] everybody's you know keeps texting me to
[18:19] be careful and and be careful with these
[18:21] people because you know my life might be
[18:23] in danger and I I think last year I kind
[18:26] of made peace with that but um I've been
[18:30] you know on on the media for for the
[18:33] last couple of weeks uh actually talking
[18:36] about this massive Scandal because
[18:40] basically it's nepotism at its core
[18:42] right you have the presidential
[18:45] adviser that is mining Bitcoin about a
[18:48] tenth of the current capacity of the dam
[18:51] because it's uh it's low water level and
[18:54] they're they're actually doing um God
[18:57] how do you say this in Eng they're
[18:59] actually doing rolling
[19:00] blackouts um so lad shedding because
[19:04] there is uh not enough capacity to power
[19:06] the entire city and while this is
[19:09] happening while you're increasing rates
[19:11] for people while the economy is already
[19:12] gone down as much as it's gone down
[19:16] while there's 50 to 60% inflation you
[19:18] could have actually just fixed this
[19:21] problem already with the mining capacity
[19:22] that you've had since
[19:25] 2022 and aside aside from that fact
[19:29] he's doing it completely in private so
[19:32] nobody knows what's what's happening
[19:34] there and all you're doing this since
[19:39] 2022 something as simple as an executive
[19:42] order
[19:44] to recognize Bitcoin as you know legal
[19:48] tender something that should take TW
[19:51] three two to three days max you're
[19:55] basically preventing that from happening
[19:58] because you don't want public
[20:01] opinion about what you're doing or want
[20:04] what you're doing to be known so we just
[20:07] uncover this Scandal it's U it's been in
[20:09] the news for the last two weeks um I the
[20:13] president is not happy with me at the
[20:15] moment uh neither is his NE neither is
[20:18] his
[20:20] advisor um so yeah that's it's it's uh
[20:24] it's a touchy subject at the moment but
[20:27] I have been advocating for you know
[20:29] adoption because recognizing it it as
[20:32] legal tender and and and you know not
[20:35] preventing adoption just solely for the
[20:38] interests of one person that it benefits
[20:42] the entire
[20:43] country and this man is just preventing
[20:47] economic development of this country
[20:50] because of his own
[20:52] self-interest and it it's just
[20:54] mindboggling to me so I've I've been
[20:57] I've been uh
[20:59] yeah I've been very vocal about it
[21:02] recently is is it fair to say that uh
[21:06] corruption then holds back
[21:09] sur's adoption of Bitcoin and basically
[21:12] is it fair to say that corruption is
[21:14] suam holds back the being this second
[21:18] Sal
[21:19] Salvador yes we could have been the
[21:22] second El Salvador since November and
[21:24] it's just being held back because of
[21:27] this and
[21:29] you know I've I've come out publicly
[21:31] spoken about this and and I'll be
[21:33] speaking about this more and getting
[21:36] more light shed on this because it's
[21:38] been in the news the last couple of
[21:39] weeks um it's it's in the news the last
[21:42] week
[21:43] constantly and there's more articles
[21:45] coming out more interviews I've I've
[21:47] done a lot to to express how it you know
[21:50] benefits the people and how you cannot
[21:52] prevent adoption just for the benefit of
[21:55] one person or one private company right
[21:58] um
[21:59] so I'll be speaking more about it and it
[22:01] is literally corruption that is holding
[22:03] this back and yeah it's it's it's just
[22:07] mindblowing like so we have a saying in
[22:10] this country um everything is possible
[22:13] with God and in
[22:15] zum and it's just the amount of the
[22:18] amount of scandals and the amount of
[22:20] things that like the the audacity of
[22:23] corruption in this country because this
[22:25] government is the
[22:26] worst by far are of any government we've
[22:31] ever had like this government does not
[22:35] give a like they're they're corrupt
[22:39] and you'll catch them being corrupt
[22:42] you'll you there will be a big
[22:44] Scandal and then they'll just lie to
[22:47] your face about it and then in a week
[22:50] everybody will have forgotten like even
[22:53] our attorney general at this point is
[22:56] being politically coerced like there's
[22:59] no prosecution happening for scandals
[23:02] that should have been prosecuted or at
[23:04] least um
[23:06] investigate they don't even investigate
[23:10] and you know reporters have been a like
[23:13] pretty held back for the last year
[23:15] because they're afraid of repercussions
[23:16] by government because some have been
[23:18] beaten up and some have lost their jobs
[23:20] or have been
[23:23] threatened um so since my interview came
[23:25] out about a month ago on a Dave podcast
[23:28] I highlighted that fact I said
[23:30] journalists are afraid to to report to
[23:35] to give away information to report the
[23:37] news like what are we living in a
[23:39] communistic country what is this
[23:41] supposed to become Venezuela like you
[23:44] know I highlighted it like that and
[23:46] since then I see that journalists are
[23:48] being more vocal again are are are you
[23:50] know trying to to fight back more and
[23:54] with elections coming up next year you
[23:57] also have you know all these other
[23:58] political parties and the opposition uh
[24:01] getting more traction and coming out
[24:03] more vocally about all this
[24:05] corruption um so it should be exciting
[24:08] like an exciting couple of months if you
[24:10] are listening to this podcast you might
[24:12] be wondering what is actually the setup
[24:15] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[24:17] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[24:20] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[24:21] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[24:24] right way let's focus on the first thing
[24:26] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple a Bitcoin
[24:29] only exchange don't deal with the
[24:31] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[24:33] exchange that has an own token or
[24:35] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[24:37] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[24:40] for me the best partner for that and now
[24:44] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[24:45] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[24:48] a self custody solution where you
[24:51] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[24:54] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[24:57] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[25:00] your Bitcoin on there back up your seed
[25:02] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[25:06] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than a
[25:08] th000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[25:12] have one last thing before we get back
[25:13] to the video I'm really passionate about
[25:15] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[25:18] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[25:21] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[25:24] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[25:27] conference in whole of Europe for all
[25:29] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[25:32] this place in June for all europes it's
[25:34] a must go anyways you are so close to
[25:37] the Bitcoin Pride conference you
[25:38] basically have to come I will do
[25:40] interviews there and I would love to
[25:43] meet you all there use code Robin for
[25:46] all my sponsors to get discounts and use
[25:48] the links down in the description and
[25:50] hopefully Bitcoin as legal tender very
[25:54] soon uh is there anything the
[25:57] international audience and the Bitcoin
[25:59] Community can do to uh support suram uh
[26:03] the Bitcoin adoption there support you
[26:05] in being
[26:08] the front runner in the
[26:12] elections well anything that the Bitcoin
[26:15] Community can do to help specifically on
[26:18] the ground here like just imagine if you
[26:20] could have been in El Salvador before it
[26:22] became legal tender right imagine if you
[26:25] could be um working with a candidate on
[26:27] the ground in a very small country with
[26:29] 240,000 people in the city so it's it's
[26:32] pretty easy to to like go around and
[26:35] start onboarding merchants and helping
[26:38] and um creating more awareness
[26:40] specifically we need help with
[26:43] fundraising because um our campaign is
[26:46] not I'm not a politician I I'm an
[26:50] entrepreneur you know I I started an
[26:52] import company 21 years ago I started an
[26:55] infrastructure company about 10 years
[26:57] ago so I have two companies in this
[26:59] country and I I really don't need to go
[27:02] into politics I actually didn't want to
[27:05] until Samson kind of pushed me over the
[27:08] edge in November he's like yeah you
[27:09] should you should do it you should run
[27:11] and and I really yes yes I should um and
[27:18] you know politicians have been trying to
[27:20] convince me for the last six years and I
[27:22] didn't want to join any existing
[27:24] political party um but after
[27:26] conversations here with um existing
[27:29] Party leaders and you know leaders of
[27:31] captains of industry and influential
[27:33] leaders here um knowing that they
[27:38] support and they'd support my Approach
[27:41] because my Approach would not be
[27:43] political at all it is very rigorous and
[27:46] and very you know to the point like like
[27:49] I'd run a business um which means a an a
[27:54] massive overhaul
[27:56] privatization um privatization of a lot
[27:58] of government Ministries transitioning
[28:00] about 40,000 people that work for
[28:02] government at the moment about 60% of
[28:05] our working population trans
[28:07] transferring transitioning them into
[28:09] other
[28:10] Industries um diversifying into
[28:12] technology making Bitcoin the unit of
[28:14] account because I don't just want to
[28:15] make it legal
[28:17] tender I want tum to be on a Bitcoin
[28:20] standard because our SRD has failed us
[28:23] since 1975 like our our local currency
[28:27] it hasn't served this country at
[28:29] all and just imagine people earning a
[28:33] salary in Satoshi going to the
[28:36] supermarket the pricing being in
[28:39] satoshi's seeing it go down in
[28:43] comparison to the import prices right
[28:46] it's all going to be in Fiat seeing Fiat
[28:49] lose its value in relation to what you
[28:51] earning in
[28:53] so it and especially with the amount of
[28:56] resources we've had we've we have we
[28:58] we've done the calculations and with the
[29:01] existing resources we have right now we
[29:03] can actually have a very prosperous
[29:04] population on a Bitcoin standard so I
[29:08] I'd ask the Bitcoin Community to come
[29:10] here to reach out you know reach out to
[29:13] me on um on X or or join the the the
[29:17] Bitcoins that are on telegram group
[29:19] reach out there in whatever way you can
[29:21] support whether it be marketing creating
[29:25] video content um helping
[29:28] you know orange fill people here on the
[29:31] ground education is very important we
[29:35] you know we have we recently launched
[29:37] our first uh Fetti Federation here so
[29:41] there's now a a community of about 1300
[29:44] families that are um in a Soccer Academy
[29:49] and they're learning to save in in
[29:52] Bitcoin and using that Federation so
[29:54] that is um you know it's it's already
[29:56] starting but we need more support in
[29:58] terms of Education in terms of funding
[30:02] specifically because like the the the
[30:05] Federation itself for example they need
[30:07] they need funding just for for their
[30:10] program and getting funding here from
[30:13] the private sector with an economy
[30:15] that's already tanked uh you know for
[30:17] the last three years it's it's pretty
[30:20] difficult and things here aren't that
[30:22] expensive you know the average salary
[30:25] year is between 150 to 175 us which is
[30:29] very low if you could hire people here
[30:33] remote like imagine if you could hire 10
[30:35] people here remote right 1,750 us a
[30:39] month to go door too to teach people how
[30:43] to use blink or go to Merchant to to
[30:46] spread the Bitcoin I P's uh spread NFC
[30:49] cards uh just simple things like that
[30:53] that is already a 1750 us that people
[30:58] are being paid in in Bitcoin that they
[31:01] can spend and that is what we need we
[31:03] need more Bitcoin flowing
[31:06] into our economy we need more people
[31:10] being paid in in in Bitcoin so that that
[31:13] is something that will help um we're not
[31:16] C campaigning like a traditional
[31:18] political party here we're not doing you
[31:21] know all the fake promises and nonsense
[31:24] that they're doing and and going around
[31:25] from from City to city or town to town
[31:28] we have specific um projects projects
[31:31] that I had already been working on uh
[31:33] with the orphanages with um you know old
[31:36] people homes with assisted living
[31:39] facilities and uh just education in
[31:43] general so just supporting in those
[31:46] projects already helps like if you can
[31:48] support in any way whatever way possible
[31:51] for any of those projects specifically
[31:54] education would be amazing if we can get
[31:57] more big coiners to help with teaching
[32:00] um Tech or or um you know having a
[32:04] platform for kids um 17 and above and
[32:08] adults to be able to learn you know
[32:10] development on Lightning for example if
[32:13] you can roll that out here any
[32:15] assistance is is welcome and and
[32:18] everything helps Bitcoin adoption right
[32:20] so it's not waiting until the elections
[32:22] next year we're helping adoption right
[32:25] now because there's still a lot of
[32:26] Grassroots efforts help like working um
[32:29] happening on the ground we're we're
[32:31] still working every day to increase
[32:34] adoption here we have a monthly Meetup
[32:38] where more than a 100 people come to
[32:39] listen and learn so the community is
[32:43] growing the communities here um whether
[32:47] this government does it and they make
[32:49] themselves SE second and put themselves
[32:51] on the map or I you know win the
[32:54] elections next year which is a very high
[32:57] probability because I swear to God if
[32:59] you look at interviews of these people
[33:01] and just do some research on the amount
[33:03] of corruption that has happened and just
[33:05] the amount of support that I myself get
[33:07] from both the large existing political
[33:11] parties as well as the smaller political
[33:13] parties then you'd realize that there's
[33:16] no one in this country with a vision to
[33:18] develop this country and there's no one
[33:20] in this country with a vision to develop
[33:22] it looking towards 2030
[33:26] 2035 and where the the world is heading
[33:28] in terms of technological advancement
[33:30] and and development right with AI and
[33:32] Quantum Computing and and just the
[33:35] progress that's happening
[33:37] internationally and what's happening in
[33:38] the Bitcoin um
[33:40] industry people don't know or don't
[33:42] realize or they're still stuck in in web
[33:45] 3 mumbo
[33:46] jumbo so if you just do the research
[33:49] you'll see that my odds are very very
[33:52] much well stacked in my favor so in
[33:56] whatever way you can come and help
[33:57] adoption it's it's very much appreciated
[34:00] it's amazing to hear that uh small
[34:03] countries have a chance and actually
[34:05] have the the hope uh in in persons there
[34:08] helping them grow up uh and and get to a
[34:11] full Bitcoin adoption I feel like the
[34:14] this would not even been possible in in
[34:17] Austria because the system is working
[34:20] too good that people want to do any
[34:23] change and I feel like that's the um
[34:27] that's a chance for countries like
[34:29] Surinam where like there are those big
[34:33] problems and this can be a major chance
[34:36] for surum to actually uh be one of the
[34:40] uh leaders even though with just 600,000
[34:42] people it's like half of the population
[34:44] of the Austrian um Capital but still
[34:48] 600,000 people are 600,000 people uh and
[34:51] it would be massive to have more than
[34:54] just Salvador also on the map it uh I
[34:56] can only encourage anybody to just like
[34:59] support with whatever they they can uh
[35:02] and support that thing um what I was not
[35:06] 100% sure when you said like Bitcoin as
[35:08] a unit of account would that mean
[35:09] ditching the Surinam dollar completely
[35:13] or uh yes nice yes yes just grapping it
[35:18] from existence uh it's been done before
[35:21] by previous governments and like it was
[35:25] the the cames Florin and then it was the
[35:28] surnames Gilder and then it was the
[35:29] camese dollar um so it's been done
[35:33] before because of inflation and I see no
[35:38] reason aside from like lit literally the
[35:41] only problem might be um certain exports
[35:46] right because then certain exports
[35:48] become pricey because then it is
[35:50] increasing in price in relation to every
[35:52] other fiat currency um so we we've
[35:55] thought of some Solutions on that um and
[35:59] how to you know protect those sectors
[36:01] but basically it would
[36:03] be the we're we're mainly an import
[36:06] economy we import more than that we
[36:08] export and we don't need to export our
[36:11] gold we can keep it here and issue it
[36:13] for example on liquid right then we'd
[36:16] have the same amount of of exports but
[36:19] the gold could remain here or in evolved
[36:22] in Switzerland whatever they' require
[36:25] but basically we could actually keep our
[36:27] resources here and maintain that source
[36:29] of income so there's no reason why we
[36:31] couldn't completely transition to a
[36:34] Bitcoin standard and then just be a
[36:36] country that just lives on bitcoin
[36:38] because I see it as a way to instead of
[36:42] having people lose 50 to 60% to inl
[36:46] inflation every year having them you
[36:49] know see an increase in value and also
[36:52] if you don't have the US dollar as an
[36:55] intermediary if they just earn in
[36:58] Satoshi if they just earn um in Bitcoin
[37:02] then they're not going to see
[37:03] fluctuations in US dollar they're just
[37:05] going to see depreciation of the US
[37:08] dollar right so it's actually better for
[37:11] them and it actually is it will be I
[37:14] think the first population to actually
[37:16] live completely on a Bitcoin standard
[37:18] and then have that that the the the full
[37:22] benefit ofit what Bitcoin has to offer
[37:25] and that it actually fulfills what it
[37:27] was developed
[37:29] for with within an entire country on it
[37:32] and it also forces companies to you know
[37:35] now you have companies like micro
[37:37] strategy block they they put it in their
[37:39] treasury which is a nice proof of
[37:41] concept like we we see how micr strategy
[37:44] is is doing with that right this would
[37:47] force every company to use Satoshi as
[37:52] their unit of account and their revenue
[37:54] would be in Satoshi their profits would
[37:57] be in satosi their treasuries would be
[37:59] in Satoshi so we'd make every company
[38:01] inam small medium large into a mini
[38:06] micro
[38:08] strategy that's amazing just imagine
[38:11] that yeah that is that is what we've
[38:12] been waiting for right
[38:13] hyperbitcoinization they hear that
[38:15] Bitcoin wins and I truly think this is
[38:18] the way and I think uh when you have a
[38:20] crer that is adopting it so early and so
[38:24] fast uh this means that you have a
[38:28] massive massive benefit from it like
[38:30] there is as I always say even the last
[38:33] person even the last country that will
[38:35] adopt the Bitcoin standard will benefit
[38:36] from it but if you're early on you will
[38:40] uh benefit from its properties and from
[38:43] its adoption so when you are last you
[38:46] will only benefit from its uh properties
[38:49] from Bitcoin but if you're early on you
[38:52] even benefit from it being adopted in a
[38:55] rapid pace so that's that's something
[38:57] really beautiful that uh uh can happen
[39:00] to suram and I hope it will happen um
[39:02] you talked a little bit about the
[39:04] scandals and the um corruption in in in
[39:08] Surinam are you in any way shape or form
[39:12] afraid that the election might be rigged
[39:16] isn't that funny exactly at the moment
[39:20] when I asked Maya are the elections
[39:23] rigged exactly at that moment
[39:26] unfortunately
[39:28] uh her internet Fallout and we tried to
[39:32] do an continuation of that like just a 5
[39:35] days later like we recorded on Tuesday
[39:38] then on Sunday we tried again the
[39:41] internet was still not working in
[39:43] Surinam uh and for her like the data was
[39:46] working but it was really bad internet
[39:47] so it was hard to make a remote podcast
[39:50] with that um and she she said it will be
[39:54] probably back up nicely in one month
[39:57] so what we decided is let that podcast
[40:00] as it is because it's really valuable
[40:03] and we will start the next podcast that
[40:06] we will have with Maya in one month
[40:10] probably it will be out uh in like one
[40:12] and a half months or two months
[40:14] something like that uh as like kind of a
[40:16] part two but uh as a own episode for
[40:19] Maya uh about R elections and uh more
[40:23] questions about that but I still wanted
[40:26] to have this podcast episode as one
[40:29] whole thing out right now because I feel
[40:32] like people could learn from that and
[40:34] can get something inside uh get some
[40:37] insights from that so hopefully you
[40:39] enjoyed it hopefully you liked it uh and
[40:43] yeah I I will close the episode
[40:45] unfortunately without an end routine
[40:47] which I really hate but we cannot always
[40:49] get what we want I
[40:51] guess but the overlords uh shut us down
[40:56] uh in that sense
[40:57] uh we will be back soon and uh I will
[41:02] now with that uh episode I will fulfill
[41:06] a request I got a lot in my comment
[41:08] sections because people think that I
[41:10] sound like Anor schwarzeneger which is a
[41:13] huge compliment for me uh but I just
[41:16] don't think that I sound like Arnold
[41:18] schwarzeneger like I probably could
[41:20] sound like him if I'm trying to do that
[41:23] but I I don't feel like that I actually
[41:26] sound like him but I will still do it uh
[41:28] and this is my first time I'll do it on
[41:30] the podcast so I'll be back
[41:33] [Music]
