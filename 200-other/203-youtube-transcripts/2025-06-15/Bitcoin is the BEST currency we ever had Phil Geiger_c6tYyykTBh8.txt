[00:00] Bitcoin has the best chance of becoming
[00:01] the global Reserve currency Bitcoin will
[00:03] be the 50% of of every human interaction
[00:06] with hdle waves I think are the most
[00:08] important visualization of the Bitcoin
[00:09] blockchain all of the sudden everybody
[00:11] saves in Bitcoin where it's like oh if I
[00:13] wait two months longer and don't get the
[00:15] newest iPhone or wait like a year longer
[00:17] before I upgrade my car this completely
[00:20] changes Society largest number of users
[00:23] were with custodians but the most
[00:24] Bitcoin was in self- custody and same
[00:26] thing is true today most people lose
[00:28] their Bitcoin from just getting their
[00:30] accounts hack their username their
[00:31] password two Factor
[00:33] authentication why is Unchained or like
[00:36] yourself uh Bitcoin only focused or
[00:39] differently ask uh do you see all the
[00:41] other cryptos or altcoins as a
[00:45] scam that's a really great question and
[00:47] I might even start before before
[00:49] answering it directly I I love to hear
[00:51] that you're based in Europe because I
[00:53] started my Bitcoin career while I was
[00:55] living in Europe so my wife and I we
[00:58] weren't married at the time but we were
[01:00] living in the Netherlands so that's
[01:02] where I really left my Fiat career in
[01:04] about
[01:05] 2017 and started my career in Bitcoin so
[01:09] love uh helping out the Europeans to
[01:12] understand why Bitcoin now to your next
[01:15] question I think it's a very deep
[01:18] question that requires quite a bit of
[01:21] research so it's my perspective that
[01:24] Bitcoin is the new Global Reserve
[01:28] currency that might be a big
[01:30] statement but the reason I believe that
[01:33] that is true is because Bitcoin has a
[01:35] fixed supply of 21 million and it is not
[01:39] controlled by any single Authority so
[01:42] all other currencies Fiat crypto
[01:47] whatever they were all founded and
[01:49] created by a central Authority and
[01:52] what's
[01:53] different with Bitcoin is that while it
[01:56] was created by a pseudonymous individual
[01:58] Satoshi Nakamoto we don't know who they
[02:01] were that person left the project very
[02:03] early on specifically so that they
[02:07] wouldn't be a single point of failure
[02:09] for Bitcoin so when I think about
[02:12] Bitcoin versus all of the other
[02:16] currencies the the core components that
[02:18] I think are really important are one the
[02:21] fixed supply of 21 million all other
[02:23] currencies don't really have a monetary
[02:27] policy with much credibility or seeing
[02:30] just this week with the Yen the third
[02:32] largest currency in the world that it's
[02:36] being massively devalued and seemingly
[02:40] randomly with Bitcoin you have a fixed
[02:42] Supply it's released on a schedule and
[02:45] regardless of what's happening in the
[02:46] world that schedule just keeps on
[02:49] chugging
[02:50] along that's not the
[02:53] only important thing about Bitcoin but I
[02:55] think it it's where like the all the
[02:57] value for a majority of the value step
[02:59] stems from other aspects of Bitcoin that
[03:01] are really really useful is that it's
[03:04] censorship resistant nobody can prevent
[03:06] you from sending Bitcoin it's neutral so
[03:09] it's it's kind of like the internet in a
[03:11] lot of ways where nobody's really in
[03:13] charge of the Internet it's just a
[03:14] global
[03:17] tool and uh you can also secure it in
[03:21] very interesting ways so Unchained when
[03:26] we first started we actually did the the
[03:30] founders really thought that maybe it
[03:34] wasn't just going to be Bitcoin it might
[03:35] be Bitcoin plus a few other
[03:38] cryptocurrencies or maybe hundreds or
[03:40] thousands of other
[03:41] cryptocurrencies and so unchain actually
[03:43] supported ethereum early on in its life
[03:47] for Bitcoin collateralized or crypto
[03:50] collateralized loans at the
[03:52] time but we've always tried to build our
[03:55] products and services using the native
[03:58] properties of these different Protocols
[04:00] of Bitcoin so we built our entire
[04:02] product Suite on top of Bitcoin multi
[04:06] signature which is a type of address
[04:08] that is controlled by multiple keys so
[04:10] if you have a hardware wallet or a
[04:11] mobile app for example those wallets are
[04:13] typically controlled by one key with
[04:16] multisig you build a Bitcoin wallet that
[04:19] has multiple
[04:20] keys in our case it's two of three so
[04:23] three total Keys any two of which are
[04:26] needed in order to move the Bitcoin out
[04:28] of the Vault
[04:32] so when we first started we built our
[04:35] Bitcoin collateralized loan product on
[04:36] top of multisig and then we introduced
[04:40] ethereum collateralized loans but
[04:43] there's a problem with ethereum it
[04:45] wasn't it didn't have multisig native to
[04:49] the protocol so the founders and the
[04:51] engineering team had to write a multi-
[04:54] signature smart contract for ethereum
[04:57] and this was during the time when
[04:58] ethereum just kept changing every few
[05:00] months there was a massively breaking
[05:03] backwards incompatible change unchain
[05:05] was trying to run an ethereum node we
[05:08] were trying to do it the right way
[05:09] really
[05:10] were and what we found is that we were
[05:13] investing 70% of our engineering
[05:16] resources to something that was only
[05:18] like 10% of our client base and really
[05:22] most people who were controlling those
[05:23] other cryptocurrencies didn't really
[05:25] care about this level of security that
[05:27] we were able to provide with Bitcoin
[05:29] and so we dropped it early on I think
[05:31] this was like
[05:34] 2019 and ever since then we've had the
[05:37] focus on just Bitcoin and this has been
[05:39] a massive massive Advantage for us we
[05:43] actually just recently published a video
[05:45] about our core values as a
[05:47] company this was of course formed over
[05:49] the last few years but the number one
[05:51] core value is Bitcoin is our common
[05:53] purpose so we believe that Bitcoin has
[05:56] the best chance of becoming the global
[05:58] Reserve currency and we want to help
[06:00] people who are securing Bitcoin for many
[06:03] many years we want to help long-term
[06:05] Bitcoin Savers secure manage grow their
[06:08] Bitcoin wealth and after dropping eth
[06:12] early on WE very soon after realized
[06:16] that that was the right move and there's
[06:18] no we have no plans to add any support
[06:22] for any other cryptocurrencies because
[06:24] Bitcoin is just the most valuable one
[06:27] it's the most important cryptocurrency
[06:28] there is
[06:30] yeah definitely and I think even if you
[06:32] don't say like the other ones are scams
[06:34] or they useless or something like that
[06:36] uh like there Bitcoin and it's so
[06:38] different to anything else so like we we
[06:40] we should even like I try to do it we
[06:43] should even like just separate it and
[06:44] not even compare it at all because
[06:47] they're like so separate and so
[06:48] different from each other but all of the
[06:51] but of course like it's listed on coin
[06:53] market cap with all the other groups
[06:55] like it it gets always gets in one
[06:58] bucket uh when you get to a regular Bank
[07:00] who has crypto Services they also have
[07:02] like Bitcoin ethereum in the crypto
[07:05] category so it's like a hard thing to
[07:07] break uh but it's important that
[07:10] especially we as as Bitcoin only folks
[07:13] no matter what we're doing if we have in
[07:14] a company podcast whatever we are doing
[07:16] in the space always making the
[07:18] differentiation between uh Bitcoin all
[07:21] others because I see a lot of comments
[07:23] also from people that are like oh I love
[07:26] your content but I also love Ripple I
[07:28] also love ethereum I also of Gano like
[07:31] uh even you normal normal crypto people
[07:34] that uh uh are interested in Bitcoin
[07:37] only content because they also have a
[07:39] Bitcoin stake so like I try to get this
[07:42] get this itos into everyone that it's
[07:45] Bitcoin only uh and like slowly BL the
[07:49] seeds in in in the heads that's uh that
[07:51] Bitcoin is the big thing and the other
[07:53] ones is like yeah I don't know what it
[07:55] is there's really a philosophical
[07:57] difference I think between bitcoiners
[08:00] and then I'm going to lump these people
[08:02] together but
[08:03] crypto supporters and then also just
[08:07] fiat currency supporters I think crypto
[08:10] and fiat currency are very very similar
[08:12] in a lot of ways so the way I think
[08:13] about it is
[08:16] bitcoin's disruption is that it is it it
[08:22] solved the problem of creating digital
[08:24] scarcity now historically anything that
[08:28] has been digital has not been scarce
[08:30] right pictures you can copy and paste
[08:32] pictures nfts you can copy and paste
[08:35] nfts it's the same thing with all other
[08:38] cryptocurrencies Bitcoin is the one that
[08:40] solved the problem you can't print more
[08:42] than 21 million Bitcoin all the other
[08:45] cryptocurrencies are proof that creating
[08:47] things that are digital and creating
[08:49] copies of things that are digital is
[08:51] Trivial most of the cryptocurrencies are
[08:54] very small changes to bitcoin with like
[08:57] a couple adjustments and they're not
[09:00] credible in terms of their monetary
[09:02] properties so when I think about these
[09:04] different cohorts of
[09:06] people a bitcoiner is somebody who
[09:11] believes that nobody should be able to
[09:14] print
[09:15] money central banks and people who
[09:19] support Fiat currencies believe that
[09:21] only a small number of people should be
[09:24] able to print money crypto enthusiasts
[09:27] enthusiasts think that everybody should
[09:30] be able to print money so there's a very
[09:32] kind of big divide I think
[09:35] philosophically and
[09:36] ideologically among these these three
[09:39] parties bitcoiners nobody should be able
[09:41] to print money crypto people everybody
[09:43] should be able to print money Central
[09:45] Bankers only we should be able to print
[09:47] money at 100% and uh which also lead
[09:51] like uh for me it's uh the the feat and
[09:54] crypto uh guys it's like really similar
[09:57] for me it's like the the the crypto
[09:59] people want to build the thing that's
[10:02] already existing in Fiat but just on
[10:04] blockchain like they kind of concentrate
[10:06] like let's put everything on a
[10:07] blockchain uh and it's it just does
[10:10] doesn't make sense for me because
[10:11] there's an oracle problem there like you
[10:13] have to have an an Central Authority
[10:16] that gets it on the blockchain at the
[10:18] first place then the blockchains are not
[10:20] decentralized actually they are just
[10:21] inefficient in the way of of saving it
[10:24] like there's so many problems that I
[10:26] don't even want to get into it uh but
[10:28] maybe let's uh like before I want to
[10:30] really get also into it why is Bitcoin
[10:32] so decentralized and and why can it
[10:35] enforce this 21 million cap I also saw
[10:37] on YouTube that you made a a small
[10:39] presentation on that but before we get
[10:41] into this uh um where do you see Bitcoin
[10:44] dominance going like we are now at like
[10:46] 50 60% or something like that if you
[10:49] exclude there's like a different metrix
[10:50] if you exclude the stable coins because
[10:52] they're not actually grp to they like
[10:54] more like to the Feld and we more like
[10:57] at 70% uh um dominance of Bitcoin where
[11:01] do you see Bitcoin dominance going in
[11:03] the next like long term like 20 years or
[11:06] something like that uh do you see uh
[11:09] crypto still being around or like
[11:11] Bitcoin really dominating with all the
[11:13] things going on with like 80 90% maybe
[11:17] even I've been very surprised at how
[11:20] long crypto generally has stuck around
[11:22] and I think it's because people view
[11:24] crypto as more of like a gambling or day
[11:27] trading or speculative asset
[11:29] so I hesitate to make a specific
[11:32] prediction but what I will say is that
[11:35] the Bitcoin dominance is kind of a
[11:39] faulty not kind of it's a very faulty
[11:42] metric Bitcoin is by far the most
[11:45] dominant it's the most liquid it's
[11:47] Global it's extremely
[11:50] decentralized all of the other crypto
[11:52] tokens they they have liquidity problems
[11:56] right they might appear to be worse a
[11:59] lot or have a large market cap but if
[12:01] you were to try to extract that uh that
[12:05] value out of those networks they would
[12:08] collapse and we've seen that
[12:10] historically constantly in crypto I mean
[12:12] look at FTX and ftt FTX their balance
[12:16] sheet I think was like 40 to 60% their
[12:19] own token and when there was a run on
[12:21] that token it turns out the actual value
[12:24] of the token was almost worthless again
[12:27] it's very easy to fake those numbers
[12:30] so when I think about over the long term
[12:32] yeah I I I think in reality Bitcoin is
[12:36] probably like 80 to 90% if not higher
[12:39] and you can just look at the metrics of
[12:41] these different companies and how much
[12:43] of their business is based on
[12:47] bitcoin coin Bas all these exchanges
[12:49] like most of their business is Bitcoin
[12:51] even though they list every single
[12:53] crypto token Under the Sun and that's
[12:56] why I also think it's really interesting
[12:57] that it's there are so many coin only
[12:59] exchanges and services uh coming up and
[13:02] this is like when you look back just
[13:04] like four or five years ago they're not
[13:06] that many completely Bitcoin only player
[13:10] and Educators now there are so many
[13:12] podcasts there are Services there are uh
[13:15] um Bitcoin exchanges Bitcoin only
[13:17] exchanges they really really cool and I
[13:19] like the the how the the whole place is
[13:23] evolving um with that do you also like
[13:26] see um the like we talked before a
[13:29] little bit about you think that Bitcoin
[13:32] will be the global Reserve asset I frame
[13:35] it differently but I think we we end up
[13:37] at the same kind of thought I say
[13:40] Bitcoin will be the base layer of
[13:42] everything like it's the future base
[13:43] layer of our financial system that means
[13:46] it's a global Reserve asset um and I
[13:49] think that U Bitcoin will be half of
[13:52] everything like 50% of of every human
[13:55] interaction because of every human
[13:57] interaction 50% of that is is money and
[14:00] if Bitcoin is that money uh everything
[14:03] is in there then there are like a lot of
[14:05] great topics on top of that because then
[14:08] uh we give this great store of value
[14:10] back to humanity uh which people can
[14:13] save in this will make houses affordable
[14:16] this will drive prices down this will
[14:19] bring this deflation deflationary system
[14:22] that we have
[14:23] naturally actually occurring because we
[14:25] don't inflate the money supply uh what
[14:28] what do you think of like like what what
[14:30] does Bitcoin do in general for for
[14:32] prices and the future of the economic
[14:35] system money is the most basic form of
[14:40] human
[14:42] communication even kind of lower on the
[14:45] civilization stack than spoken language
[14:50] you can do business with somebody
[14:52] without speaking their language at all
[14:54] maybe some hand gestures right but money
[14:57] is a a token of value it's it's
[15:00] communicating hey you have that thing
[15:03] over there I would like to trade this
[15:05] money for that thing we're both better
[15:08] off so it's really a fundamental tool
[15:12] for human
[15:14] civilization and until
[15:17] Bitcoin that tool has just been it's
[15:21] suffered from lots of different problems
[15:24] gold suffers from being physical you
[15:26] can't zip gold
[15:29] from the US to China from Texas I'm here
[15:31] in Austin Texas can't send it to
[15:36] changdu it's also just very difficult to
[15:39] Pro protect it centralizes right you
[15:42] need to hire a team to protect
[15:44] gold you can't just you know have a pile
[15:47] of gold in your house and so it's these
[15:51] drawbacks that have caused gold overall
[15:55] to morph into this fiat currency system
[15:58] which solves the physical physicality
[16:00] problem and the ease of transaction
[16:02] problem it mostly solves the ease of
[16:03] transaction problem but what it loses
[16:07] was gold scarcity so Bitcoin fixes both
[16:10] of those problems it is ultimately
[16:12] scarce and you can send it anywhere in
[16:14] the world
[16:16] permissionless and as such it allows us
[16:18] to do business with people who
[16:22] culturally we couldn't be more different
[16:24] you know I can use Bitcoin to hire
[16:26] somebody from across the world to
[16:28] perform a task build a
[16:31] website and so yeah it's it's an
[16:33] absolutely critical tool for human
[16:37] civilization and until we have had
[16:40] Bitcoin like it's been kind of a lie
[16:43] somebody at the root of all of society
[16:47] is able to unilaterally just sneakily
[16:50] steal value from people through
[16:53] inflation so this causes huge problems
[16:57] housing gets un unaffordable
[16:59] wealth inequality increases over time
[17:02] and it actually gets more severe the
[17:04] more you try to use that old system to
[17:08] solve it the only way in my view to
[17:11] really solve the housing Health Care
[17:14] affordability inequality problem is to
[17:17] make everyone equal at the very very
[17:18] base layer of civilization with the
[17:21] money make everyone equal nobody can
[17:23] print money there's only 21 million and
[17:26] lots of good outcomes will come from
[17:29] that yeah 100% I love how you look at it
[17:34] I think this is like when you when you
[17:35] are a longterm Bitcoin you will see like
[17:38] that uh and it's it's always fascinating
[17:41] to see um how Bitcoin actually achieved
[17:44] that and this is where you touched on
[17:46] with the uh presentation I think January
[17:49] or something like that was the was a
[17:50] presentation on on YouTube or something
[17:52] like that I saw um how does how does it
[17:55] actually perform like how does Bitcoin
[17:58] actually enforces that rule like that we
[18:01] don't have um um limited Supply that we
[18:05] don't like the supply is actually
[18:07] limited and is there any way that you
[18:10] could imagine that at some point in the
[18:13] future we can break this one 21 million
[18:16] thing is is there any way like you you
[18:19] could think of like okay when this
[18:21] happens this could be interesting where
[18:23] we like double the supply or something
[18:25] like that what I like about Bitcoin is
[18:28] it's very voluntary you get to choose to
[18:30] opt into it and so that presentation I
[18:33] gave I just wanted to give a very simple
[18:36] rundown of how Bitcoin enforces its
[18:38] fixed supply of 21 million in about 15
[18:41] minutes this is a topic that I would say
[18:44] requires significantly more than 15
[18:46] minutes of time to study but I'll do my
[18:48] best at running through my thoughts here
[18:52] so going back to the very beginning
[18:55] Bitcoin is valuable primarily because of
[18:57] its fixed supply of 21 million it's
[18:59] valuable because nobody can print it and
[19:01] so when you're buying Bitcoin or
[19:03] acquiring Bitcoin in any form or fashion
[19:06] mining it you know earning Bitcoin
[19:09] through podcasting whatever you are
[19:13] choosing that monetary policy and it
[19:16] could be a an active choice or a
[19:17] subconscious Choice most people you know
[19:20] realistically get into Bitcoin because
[19:22] they see the value of going up and they
[19:23] want to just save in that to increase
[19:26] their purchasing power but but again the
[19:29] the the root reason that that's
[19:30] happening is because it has a fixed
[19:32] Supply so when you acquire Bitcoin
[19:36] you're knowingly or unknowingly opting
[19:38] into that monetary policy and there's a
[19:40] bunch of different things that you
[19:41] individually can do to help to enforce
[19:44] that monetary policy you can run the
[19:47] software a full node you can download it
[19:50] from bitcoin.org and it tracks all of
[19:54] the transactions throughout the history
[19:56] of Bitcoin and confirms that that supply
[19:58] has been adjusted and once you're
[20:01] running that software you then are
[20:05] essentially like a decentralized banker
[20:07] of Bitcoin because you have the entire
[20:09] transaction history on your computer and
[20:12] you can see your balance and you can see
[20:13] that the supply has never changed and
[20:16] then if someone else tries to change the
[20:18] supply you get to choose you get to say
[20:21] no I don't think I'm going to join you
[20:23] I'll cut you off from the network or you
[20:25] could switch out your software and run
[20:27] the new software so what's really cool
[20:29] about Bitcoin is it becomes in some ways
[20:31] an individual Choice are you going to
[20:34] let someone else change the supply you
[20:36] can but then you have to trust that a
[20:39] majority or almost all other people move
[20:44] over to that new
[20:46] network I personally have made the
[20:48] decision that Bitcoin has a fixed supply
[20:50] of 21 million so if somebody tries to
[20:53] change the supply and there's a history
[20:55] of this happening in 2017 a small small
[20:59] group of uh people who were unhappy with
[21:01] how Bitcoin was evolving wanted to
[21:03] change a small component of Bitcoin
[21:06] totally unrelated to the supply but that
[21:08] change was backwards
[21:10] incompatible so what happened is Bitcoin
[21:13] kept running and this other
[21:15] cryptocurrency kind of forked off it
[21:18] became its own thing but it had the same
[21:20] shared history and that other
[21:22] cryptocurrency is called Bitcoin cash so
[21:25] whether they were
[21:27] knowingly in uh increasing the supply or
[21:29] printing a new money or whether they
[21:31] were ideologically really just trying to
[21:33] make that one little change doesn't
[21:34] really matter what happened was that a
[21:38] vast vast majority of bitcoiners who had
[21:42] control of their Bitcoin during that
[21:43] time once that second currency split off
[21:47] they sold the second currency for more
[21:49] Bitcoin and you can see this in the
[21:51] price chart if you look at Bitcoin cash
[21:53] and its history especially measured in
[21:56] Bitcoin you can see that early on it had
[21:58] quite a bit of value and then it very
[22:01] quickly went to almost zero in Bitcoin
[22:05] terms so this in my opinion is really
[22:08] the the Crux of why Bitcoin will never
[22:13] inflate Beyond 21 million and it's
[22:15] because there will be people during that
[22:19] time who actively trade whatever copy of
[22:23] Bitcoin is
[22:25] created and I think this is the most
[22:27] important part for everybody that does
[22:29] not understand how decentralized Bitcoin
[22:31] actually is started 2017 the block size
[22:34] was like really really study it and also
[22:38] look at the free market outcome of that
[22:40] and what people actually did and and uh
[22:43] like it was also fasinating I was not
[22:45] around at that time so I'm only like
[22:48] able to talk about it because I heard
[22:50] from other people but it uh as I saw it
[22:53] there were like the huge part of the
[22:55] industry actually on the Bitcoin cash
[22:57] side uh and only the users that opted
[23:00] out and then shifted the whole industry
[23:03] back to to the Bitcoin protocol uh
[23:05] fascinating for me to see like I can
[23:07] just like encourage everybody that did
[23:09] not uh study this till now study the
[23:12] block as what is really important for
[23:13] Bitcoin uh uh
[23:16] future I was lucky or unlucky enough to
[23:20] live through it and it was a very wild
[23:23] period for Bitcoin because to your point
[23:25] some of the largest companies in Bitcoin
[23:29] really thought that this new copy of
[23:31] Bitcoin was the right direction and so
[23:33] they put their weight behind supporting
[23:35] it but for companies that were
[23:37] supporting it they can't control exactly
[23:39] what their users are doing right and at
[23:41] the time that the copy was made by
[23:45] granting their users access to both
[23:48] forms of cryptocurrency the users could
[23:51] then make a choice they could hold on to
[23:54] both of them they could sell one of them
[23:57] for you know any other cryptocurrency or
[23:59] dollars or Euro or
[24:01] whatever and you just see that the
[24:04] market immediately crushed the copy just
[24:08] very quickly and almost instantly went
[24:12] down but there were a few other things
[24:14] that were very interesting about that
[24:16] time
[24:18] period users were demanding an upgrade
[24:21] to bitcoin that was backwards compatible
[24:24] so it wouldn't create a
[24:26] copy and
[24:29] a lot of the core developers during that
[24:31] time were unsure how to deliver that
[24:33] feature to people the core developers
[24:36] the people who were working on bitcoin
[24:38] on the software were actually somewhat
[24:39] of a roadblock to this feature that
[24:42] users really
[24:43] wanted so a developer under another kind
[24:47] of anonymous name created a copy of the
[24:51] Bitcoin software with the new upgrade
[24:54] and a bunch of users started running
[24:56] that software again it's per L money
[25:00] right and because enough users started
[25:02] running that software it it became
[25:04] almost like a black hole it started
[25:06] pulling more and more of the weight over
[25:09] into the new version of Bitcoin again
[25:11] that was still backwards incompat uh
[25:13] backwards compatible so it was still the
[25:15] same monetary policy the same protocol
[25:19] but it just had a new feature that was
[25:21] really
[25:22] requested so Bitcoin not only routed
[25:25] around the largest miners compan
[25:28] companies in the space during that time
[25:30] it also kind of routed around the
[25:33] Bitcoin core developers and I think
[25:34] that's like a lesser discussed aspect of
[25:37] this was really healthy in my opinion so
[25:40] people always say like well there's only
[25:41] a few people who maintain the Bitcoin
[25:43] code what happens if they're captured or
[25:47] co-opted this time period was another
[25:49] example of well you can very easily
[25:51] create a copy of that software and avoid
[25:55] the entire kind of Bitcoin core
[25:56] development process and continue the
[25:58] network without breaking
[26:02] it um I never really worried about the
[26:05] core developers uh because as you said
[26:07] they they are really not in power like
[26:10] every other block every other software
[26:13] project uh the uh developers are
[26:17] actually quite empowered they can put
[26:19] something in there uh and and and they
[26:22] are developing it but they are just like
[26:25] yeah they they making the code but they
[26:27] don't make the decision
[26:28] like that if we can say it like that but
[26:32] what I worried in the the beginning and
[26:34] this actually changed now that over 70%
[26:37] at one point of the miners were in China
[26:40] and now with the Exodus it's probably
[26:43] way less like 10% maybe speculating I
[26:46] mean China wanted zero but I think
[26:49] there's still a lot of mining going on
[26:50] in China um do you see it still as some
[26:54] sort of of problem that mining becomes
[26:57] more more of a specialized um operation
[27:01] uh with like only really big facilities
[27:04] can mine is there any any risks or
[27:07] problems that you
[27:09] foresee I've always thought of mining as
[27:12] actually not even its own industry it's
[27:15] just part of energy production Bitcoin
[27:18] mining is a very very critical tool for
[27:21] any sort of energy generation the reason
[27:25] being that it's always going to buy your
[27:29] electricity now it's only going to buy
[27:31] your cheapest electricity so it doesn't
[27:32] compete with manufacturing with heating
[27:36] people's homes so on but you always have
[27:39] a tool that will buy your cheapest
[27:43] electricity the other thing about
[27:44] Bitcoin mining that makes it extremely
[27:47] powerful for energy production is that
[27:49] you can flip a switch and turn it off
[27:51] and flip a switch and turn it on there's
[27:53] no ramp up or ramp down period And so
[27:56] this makes it an extremely valuable
[27:59] load uh flexible load
[28:03] tool so let's just give an example if
[28:07] you have a wind farm right you can't
[28:10] control when the wind is blowing you
[28:13] can't
[28:14] control how people are going to demand
[28:17] your wind energy you can just install
[28:20] the windmill and then generate the
[28:22] energy and then transfer it and maybe
[28:25] store some of it in batteries
[28:28] but I did some research into this and
[28:29] you know this is now a few years out of
[28:31] date but when I was doing research about
[28:33] 18% of the time people with wind farms
[28:35] were shutting off production they were
[28:38] just not generating any more energy this
[28:41] is a massive opportunity cost they could
[28:44] you know when the wind is blowing if
[28:46] people aren't demanding all of the
[28:48] electricity you could essentially vent
[28:50] the electricity into Bitcoin you can
[28:52] monetize it
[28:53] immediately so this makes renewable
[28:56] energy production a lot more uh
[28:59] affordable like more profitable
[29:01] essentially because you will always have
[29:02] somebody to buy energy regardless of
[29:04] when you're generating
[29:06] it and it's also just something that
[29:08] doesn't compete with energy that people
[29:11] need so it's a super powerful tool for
[29:14] energy
[29:15] production now I think today the way
[29:18] that we kind of look at Bitcoin mining
[29:20] is yeah there's these massive you know
[29:22] public companies and uh smaller private
[29:26] companies that are focused exclusively
[29:28] on energy or on uh Bitcoin mining it's
[29:31] like its own little
[29:32] industry but I think if you talk to them
[29:35] a lot of them realize that I need to get
[29:38] an edge on energy
[29:40] production because if you can produce
[29:42] energy for cheaper then you can mine
[29:44] Bitcoin for cheaper if you are listening
[29:46] to this podcast you might be wondering
[29:48] what is actually the setup look like of
[29:51] Robin or how can I improve my Bitcoin
[29:53] setup and there's two things you have to
[29:55] buy Bitcoin from the right source and
[29:57] you have to store Bitcoin the right way
[30:00] let's focus on the first thing how to
[30:02] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[30:04] only exchange don't deal with the
[30:06] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[30:08] exchange that has an own token or
[30:10] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[30:12] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[30:15] for me the best partner for that and now
[30:19] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[30:21] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[30:23] a self custody solution where you
[30:26] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[30:29] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[30:32] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[30:35] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[30:37] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[30:41] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than a
[30:44] th000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[30:47] have one last thing before we get back
[30:49] to the video I'm really passionate about
[30:51] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[30:53] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[30:56] in June the Bitcoin PR conference it's
[30:59] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[31:02] conference in whole of Europe for all
[31:04] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[31:07] this place in June for all europees it's
[31:09] a must go anyways you so close to the
[31:12] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[31:14] to come I will do interviews there and I
[31:17] would love to meet you all there use
[31:20] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[31:22] discounts and use the links down in the
[31:25] description and it's interesting to see
[31:27] I I also had with Lisa I always say HFF
[31:31] but I think in America it's like H or
[31:33] something like spoken about she talked
[31:36] about on my podcast that energy
[31:39] producers are in this unique position
[31:42] where they should can monetize on
[31:45] molecules molecules energy molecules
[31:48] that they actually waste right now
[31:50] they're paying to load of wasted energy
[31:53] that they actually could make money of
[31:55] and that it's a really big possibility
[31:57] is for all the energy producers
[31:59] especially those who have excess energy
[32:02] um that the act just can yeah make I
[32:06] mean it's also it's just the timing of
[32:09] the amount of energy you're producing
[32:10] and the demand for energy right if it's
[32:12] super windy you know in the middle of
[32:15] the day in nobody's home you're probably
[32:17] generating way too much
[32:19] electricity uh and you can still
[32:21] monetize that which will help you to
[32:22] build out more wind yeah I think it's
[32:25] really interesting I mean in the US
[32:27] there's even companies that are starting
[32:29] to monetize totally wasted gas so at
[32:34] landfills in the US they emit
[32:37] methane now it's just right now being
[32:40] vented into the atmosphere what you can
[32:42] do is actually burn that methane and
[32:45] power a Bitcoin miner and earn more
[32:47] money so you would actually be earning
[32:50] more
[32:51] money not venting this dangerous gas
[32:55] into the atmosphere when you have these
[32:58] economic incentives aligned like this
[33:00] really interesting things start
[33:02] happening you start seeing very major
[33:06] improvements in you know the environment
[33:09] and Energy Efficiency and so on so a lot
[33:12] of people I think at first glance look
[33:15] at Bitcoin and they're like oh it's a
[33:16] big waste of energy uses a lot of energy
[33:19] but the really important question to ask
[33:22] is specifically what energy does it use
[33:26] and then if you think about it from the
[33:28] other side of the equation from the
[33:29] energy producers standpoint It's
[33:32] actually an incredibly valuable tool to
[33:34] help you generate energy cheaper for
[33:37] people yeah it changes the incentives
[33:40] which also leads me to my next uh topic
[33:43] um which is I had both sides of the
[33:47] aisle already on my podcast because for
[33:50] me Bitcoin is a fundamental Revolution
[33:53] that changes a lot um but there's also
[33:58] the crowd that says in the end of the
[33:59] day it's just money and and if people
[34:01] are still lazy like it doesn't change
[34:04] human nature it just gives another layer
[34:07] to it but then also other people say no
[34:10] it changes the incentives of people and
[34:13] I think Charlie manga say like then give
[34:16] me your five biggest incentives and I
[34:17] will show you what you you will do uh
[34:21] and it it can change a lot I think in
[34:24] society um how do you see like uh and
[34:27] and there's another aspect also like I
[34:29] think you also talked about on our
[34:31] podcast with that um the Huddle waves
[34:34] like when we see that in Bitcoin
[34:36] actually people are holding on to their
[34:38] coins for a long period of time uh uh
[34:42] and the like any stock uh like any
[34:46] company that is publicly listed is
[34:47] really Envy of that because people are
[34:50] like trading the stock and not holding
[34:52] on for long and stuff like that how do
[34:54] you see Bitcoin is changing societ in a
[34:58] way or changing behaviors in a way long
[35:00] term or Al are also of the opinion as
[35:03] it's just money and it changes a lot for
[35:06] those who see it early but long-term
[35:09] Society level uh it changes not a lot I
[35:11] think Bitcoin
[35:13] changes almost everything um I
[35:17] think it doesn't necessarily change
[35:20] human behavior overall but it does
[35:23] incentivize cooperation and and uh
[35:27] capital accumulation and
[35:30] collaboration it makes that a lot more
[35:35] economically worth it than fiat currency
[35:38] I think in fiat currency there's an
[35:41] incentive to just get as close to the
[35:43] money printer as you possibly can by any
[35:45] means necessary and then you benefit and
[35:48] that unfortunately makes people cut
[35:51] Corners lie you know misconstrue the
[35:54] truth like produce lower
[35:56] quality items
[35:58] and I think when we have when we fix
[36:01] that like genesis inequality which is
[36:04] that some people can print money but you
[36:08] can't print
[36:09] money when we fix that so that nobody
[36:12] can print money I think the the
[36:16] positive externalities of that are
[36:19] pretty unimaginable like I can't even
[36:21] really visualize them I just think that
[36:24] it brings a a sense of Truth to things
[36:28] that are right now a pretty big lie um
[36:33] if that makes any sense so like brings
[36:34] Truth at a very fundamental level like
[36:37] you know that the value that
[36:40] you're generating and providing to other
[36:42] people is going to be yours and you can
[36:46] use that in the future to purchase
[36:49] things of value from other
[36:51] people I think it incentivizes really
[36:55] big things in the world
[36:58] yeah definitely incentives are like
[37:00] basically everything like if if you're
[37:02] incentivized to do something you will do
[37:05] it uh in in general
[37:09] like other than if you're incentivized
[37:11] to do it and you can do it you will do
[37:14] it like there is no no question about it
[37:16] and if if uh Bitcoin changes the
[37:18] incentives to to save because it a bries
[37:21] over time and all of the sudden
[37:23] everybody saves in Bitcoin not in like
[37:26] Euro or in dollar or something like that
[37:28] where incentive is like get rid of it
[37:31] because get just rid of it on its own
[37:34] and then we're getting getting Bitcoin
[37:36] where it's like oh if I wait like two
[37:39] months longer and don't get the newest
[37:40] iPhone or wait like a year longer before
[37:43] I upgrade my car or something like that
[37:46] uh then I get it for cheaper uh this
[37:48] completely changes uh society and this
[37:51] is like also what I try to bring in the
[37:54] conversation of environment because this
[37:57] is also good thing for our environment
[37:59] like an really indirectly thing but uh
[38:01] one that is really good also for for for
[38:04] that um which is also yeah Inc
[38:07] incentivizing savings is probably the
[38:10] most important environmental impact that
[38:13] we could possibly make right now you are
[38:16] incentivized by the money just turning
[38:19] into paper you're incentivized to
[38:21] consume unnecessarily you're investing
[38:23] in things that you don't care about
[38:24] you're purchasing you know a additional
[38:28] houses because it's an it's a way to
[38:31] escape this inflation with Bitcoin it
[38:34] makes any large purchase you think not
[38:37] just twice about it you think four or
[38:39] five times about it and then you wait
[38:41] and then you think a little bit more and
[38:43] then finally you you know you spend some
[38:45] Bitcoin to purchase you know a new car
[38:48] for example but it makes the purchase uh
[38:51] decision very painful and that's
[38:53] actually a very good thing it means that
[38:56] people have to compete way harder to
[38:58] earn your money it means that you're
[39:00] less likely to spend it on
[39:02] partying and it means that the sooner
[39:06] that you get to work and the sooner that
[39:08] you start delivering value to people the
[39:10] sooner you can retire because your money
[39:12] will not just you know increase in value
[39:14] over time but or not just store value
[39:17] over time it'll increase in value over
[39:18] time so it's funny I think there are
[39:21] people in Bitcoin where you know their
[39:23] most lucrative job was probably making
[39:26] sandwiches 10 years ago and saving in
[39:29] Bitcoin right and right now they could
[39:31] be some sort of exec at a company and
[39:33] they won't be able to earn as much
[39:35] Bitcoin as they did when they were
[39:37] driving Uber and saving Bitcoin 10 years
[39:39] ago definitely and it's I adopted
[39:42] Bitcoin like four years ago right around
[39:44] that time uh and ever since then uh I
[39:48] only increased my stack like every month
[39:51] I never took out of money from a stack
[39:54] and I've been all in since three years
[39:57] uh and every month I'm trying to keep
[40:00] more income than than I have expenses
[40:03] and I always try to keep uh stacking on
[40:06] stacking on stacking on I don't know
[40:08] when at what age this will ever change
[40:10] or if it ever changes but but I I like
[40:14] hasn't for me
[40:16] yet how
[40:18] how uh well this is this is now my 10th
[40:21] year in Bitcoin and I still every day
[40:25] try to earn more Bitcoin because you
[40:26] don't stop bitcoin's money and you don't
[40:29] stop earning money you don't just say
[40:30] like I guess I have enough money I'll
[40:31] just stop it's like no every day you
[40:33] want to be earning more money you
[40:35] brought up another topic that I wanted
[40:37] to touch on briefly which is this
[40:38] concept of the Huddle waves and our
[40:42] behavior that we're describing right now
[40:44] of like saving for the long run and not
[40:47] spending
[40:48] frivolously you can see that this is how
[40:51] the mark the Bitcoin Market behaves
[40:54] because Bitcoin is a public database
[40:58] earlier I was saying you can run the
[40:59] software at home you'd have all of the
[41:02] data of all the transactions and now
[41:04] what you can do is you can start
[41:05] visualizing that data and the hotle
[41:07] waves I think are the most important
[41:10] visualization of the blockchain of the
[41:12] Bitcoin blockchain and it
[41:15] shows how much Bitcoin has been just
[41:18] sitting for how long and it shows
[41:21] different bands and different waves
[41:22] because you can tell like when the Fiat
[41:25] price runs up people who been holding
[41:27] for a longer time start
[41:30] selling and then those coins become kind
[41:32] of fresh new coins and they appear at
[41:34] the bottom of the chart it's a really
[41:36] fascinating chart and definitely worth
[41:39] studying you can find it at unchain dcom
[41:41] hodle
[41:42] waves but it's it's kind of it's the
[41:45] truth right you're just seeing the true
[41:47] behavior of people who are treating
[41:49] Bitcoin as money and overwhelmingly
[41:53] people hold it as a savings vehicle for
[41:56] years I think when you're new to bitcoin
[41:59] you might think oh this is really risky
[42:01] it's so volatile it's a trading asset
[42:04] and it is it's trading asset it's very
[42:06] volatile but if you want to really do
[42:09] well with Bitcoin and increase your
[42:11] purchasing power the majority of people
[42:14] just hold on to it for years and it's
[42:17] something like if you hold on to bitcoin
[42:19] for at least three or four years there's
[42:22] you're in Fiat profit it's preserved
[42:26] value or significantly increased in
[42:29] value yeah definitely and it's uh I I I
[42:33] always try to debate those things
[42:37] because uh then people are going like oh
[42:39] but this two years this op from Bitcoin
[42:41] and I'm like two years like everything
[42:45] under five years is for me not even
[42:47] worth looking at because it's such a
[42:49] short amount of time like I consider
[42:52] five years extremely short term and
[42:54] medium term is for me like 10 years in
[42:57] long term you're talking like 50
[42:59] years uh granted there's no 50 years in
[43:03] Bitcoin uh so like for me like Bitcoin
[43:06] in itself has no long-term history it
[43:08] has like a really medium short-term
[43:11] history because it's just a short thing
[43:14] there but if you look at any amount
[43:17] longer than five years and if you're
[43:19] looking at lower time Horizons then I
[43:22] encourage you look at longer time
[43:23] Horizons because stretch out your few a
[43:26] little bit
[43:27] uh it's it's good for your life uh and
[43:30] then you don't you don't uh like you
[43:33] don't trade Bitcoin if you wants to get
[43:35] that um in the US some of the some of
[43:38] the fastest growing Bitcoin products are
[43:41] Bitcoin held in retirement accounts so
[43:43] there's a couple different types of
[43:44] retirement accounts in the US and you
[43:47] know you could have a employer sponsored
[43:49] retirement account of 401k or an
[43:51] individual retirement account in IRA and
[43:54] you get certain tax advantages based on
[43:56] how you form your retirement account you
[43:59] can either pay taxes on your money up
[44:01] front and put it into the account where
[44:03] then it can grow taxfree or you can
[44:06] deduct um cash from your paycheck don't
[44:10] pay tax on it now and then you have to
[44:12] pay taxes on it later so there's these
[44:15] retirement accounts and you can now put
[44:17] Bitcoin into those retirement accounts
[44:20] and so those are again like across many
[44:23] different companies some of the fastest
[44:25] growing Bitcoin products are these
[44:26] Bitcoin IAS because it's just such a
[44:30] good longterm asset and when you move
[44:33] something into an IRA typically I mean
[44:35] some people again trade their IAS I'm
[44:37] not one of those people but when you
[44:39] move Bitcoin into a retirement account
[44:41] typically you're not even thinking about
[44:44] taking it out you just said it and
[44:45] forget it for years and so that's why I
[44:48] think Bitcoin is such a potent
[44:50] retirement tool is uh I I'm not from
[44:55] America so I I heard a lot of IA and for
[44:58] for 1K and and all the stuff but uh is
[45:01] is it like you have to buy an Bitcoin
[45:04] ETF for that or can you still self
[45:06] custody St stuff uh when you have an IRA
[45:10] there are there are three
[45:12] primary maybe four three to four primary
[45:14] ways that you can get Bitcoin in Ira now
[45:17] because of the ETFs that's probably the
[45:19] easiest way so if you have an account
[45:21] with like a major traditional company in
[45:24] the US like a Fidelity Schwab
[45:27] you know so on you can move some of your
[45:30] retirement funds into the ETFs the
[45:33] problem there is there's so many
[45:34] different layers of counterparty risk
[45:36] and if the last 15 years of Bitcoin has
[45:39] have told taught us anything it's you
[45:41] need to be really careful with who you
[45:43] trust in
[45:46] Bitcoin the other ways that you can get
[45:48] it are like direct uh direct Bitcoin
[45:51] Holdings through like Ira companies and
[45:55] then you can also control keys to real
[45:58] Bitcoin in an IRA account so there's a
[46:02] bunch of different ways that you can get
[46:03] some Bitcoin I think in that that second
[46:06] version where you just have like direct
[46:08] access to bitcoin again you have that
[46:09] custody problem like where is it being
[46:12] custody have they done a good job
[46:14] securing the Bitcoin um can you get
[46:17] Bitcoin out or only dollars you know
[46:19] with the ETFs you can only get dollars
[46:21] out with the ones that that have custody
[46:25] kind of in direct exposure to bitcoin
[46:27] sometimes you can get Bitcoin out
[46:29] sometimes it's dollars only and then
[46:30] when you control the keys of
[46:32] course you have
[46:34] Bitcoin H that's really cool and uh
[46:37] Unchained has a really cool uh Services
[46:40] also with like uh custody Solutions um
[46:43] which is the the topic I want to touch
[46:45] on also um because it's really important
[46:48] that people first of all understand that
[46:49] self- custo is the way uh uh but there
[46:52] are different levels that like I think
[46:55] if you have aund to thousand Euros or
[46:58] dollars in in Bitcoin it's a different
[47:00] story when you have like half a million
[47:02] Euros or dollars in Bitcoin like you
[47:04] need different setups for different
[47:06] things because if you have €2 200 a
[47:09] hardware wallet is a kind of big expense
[47:11] like you pay like 100 for a hardware
[47:13] wallet and you only have €2 200 EUR in
[47:16] in Bitcoin so like it doesn't really
[47:18] make sense uh in that regard uh other
[47:21] than if you plan to do more with that um
[47:25] where do you see those like ranges and
[47:28] what do you usually recommend for people
[47:30] getting into that and especially with
[47:32] like a custody solution uh where a
[47:35] collaborate custody I think it's called
[47:38] Uh like how when do you recommend
[47:41] that there are many different custody
[47:44] options in Bitcoin historically the most
[47:48] the most the greatest number of
[47:50] people use a custodian and basically I
[47:54] guess even at a higher level all Bitcoin
[47:56] is controlled by keys and keys can live
[47:59] on little tiny devices they can live on
[48:01] your phone they can live with a
[48:04] custodian but at the end of the day all
[48:08] you know 19 whatever six million Bitcoin
[48:11] that are available are controlled by
[48:12] Keys now you can choose to hold your
[48:15] keys or you can pay somebody to hold
[48:17] keys on your
[48:19] behalf the greatest number of users use
[48:23] custodians today that's where the
[48:26] custodian
[48:27] control the keys on your behalf the
[48:30] problem and and people do that because
[48:32] it's like oh I don't want to learn how
[48:33] to use Keys it's too complicated too
[48:35] scary the problem is that you have so
[48:37] many different layers of risk
[48:39] there what's primarily protecting your
[48:42] Bitcoin in that model isn't really how
[48:45] the custodian is controlling the keys
[48:46] like that's very important but most
[48:49] people lose their
[48:50] Bitcoin from just getting their accounts
[48:53] hacked so their username their password
[48:56] two Factor authentication because
[48:58] somebody can get into your custodian
[48:59] account they have the Bitcoin
[49:01] essentially they can coers the company
[49:03] to send Bitcoin to their address that's
[49:06] how most
[49:07] people that's how most people lose their
[49:09] Bitcoin Far and Away the greatest number
[49:11] of Bitcoin millions and millions of
[49:14] Bitcoin are secured in self- custody
[49:16] where individuals control keys it's a
[49:19] smaller number of individuals but a vast
[49:21] majority of the Bitcoin that's out there
[49:23] and even within self custody there's a
[49:26] bunch of different flavors there's
[49:28] single signature where you have one key
[49:30] controlling your Bitcoin and then
[49:32] there's multi- signature where you have
[49:35] multiple keys that are used to kind of
[49:38] create like a safety deposit box or a
[49:40] vault and then multiple keys are used to
[49:43] spend the Bitcoin single signature is
[49:46] really good as a first step to start
[49:47] learning about how to hold the keys you
[49:50] can test it out with smaller
[49:53] amounts multi signature I think is the
[49:55] best for your long-term wealth the
[49:59] Bitcoin you're thinking about holding
[50:00] for
[50:02] years because in a multi signature
[50:05] address and again with unchain for
[50:07] example we use two of three so the the
[50:10] Bitcoin address is Created from three
[50:13] keys unchain hold one holds one our
[50:16] clients hold
[50:18] two two out of three keys are needed to
[50:20] spend the Bitcoin in that model there's
[50:22] no single item there that you can lose
[50:24] that would cause you to lose Bitcoin
[50:26] we've all read those stories of you know
[50:28] the the stories of the guy who lost his
[50:30] hard drive in a dump it has like you
[50:32] know hundred million dollars or probably
[50:34] even more than that now worth of
[50:36] bitcoin the reason that they lost their
[50:39] Bitcoin is because there was a single
[50:41] item that was securing all their Bitcoin
[50:43] that hard drive in that example we've
[50:46] also heard of people who forget the pin
[50:48] on their device lose get locked out of
[50:50] their Bitcoin again that's a problem
[50:52] because there's just one device securing
[50:54] it if you have multisig in multiple
[50:58] keys and especially multi- with a
[51:00] partner which is collaborative custody
[51:03] you have a lot of redundancy you can
[51:04] make a pretty critical mistake you make
[51:06] multiple critical critical mistakes
[51:08] without losing any amount of
[51:11] Bitcoin now you know if you want to if
[51:13] you don't want to learn you know
[51:14] multi-sig or keys or all that some
[51:17] people will then just choose multiple
[51:18] custodians all right I'll spread out my
[51:20] pots I'll have a little bit here a
[51:21] little bit there a little bit there the
[51:22] problem is if any one of those runs into
[51:25] an issue you've lost money again compare
[51:28] that to multi you can lose multiple
[51:31] items without losing any Bitcoin so it's
[51:34] that single kind of critical point of
[51:35] failure that multisig solves for which
[51:37] is why Unchained built an entire
[51:40] Financial Services Suite on top of that
[51:43] that custody model it's what's helped us
[51:45] to grow to securing over 990,000 Bitcoin
[51:49] yeah I love it I think uh we are still
[51:52] in an early stage and we need so many
[51:55] companies solution
[51:57] uh Hardware wallets service providers
[51:59] that just like try to innovate try to
[52:02] make it better and everything that is
[52:05] Bitcoin only and get to self custody I
[52:07] promote
[52:08] it I want Bitcoin in self- custody I
[52:12] have those friends that have everything
[52:14] in Bitcoin and then they have it at
[52:15] exchange and I'm like there are
[52:17] solutions out there like if you you want
[52:19] to have a service there are solutions
[52:21] out there for you that you can use the
[52:22] service if you want to do it yourself I
[52:24] can show you I will be there for you you
[52:26] like we can make a seminar for a whole
[52:28] day here there's a harder wallet try it
[52:31] out at least for a little bit so I'm I'm
[52:33] really passionate about self- custody
[52:34] taking your own keys but uh it's on cool
[52:37] Insight I never heard that before that
[52:38] the vast majority of users have
[52:40] custodians but the vast majority of
[52:42] purchasing power actually have it in
[52:44] self custody which makes sense oh yeah
[52:47] like I think on on exchanges there's
[52:49] like three to four million Bitcoin and
[52:52] then there's about four you know three
[52:54] to four million Bitcoin lost and so that
[52:56] means there's 11 to 12 million Bitcoin
[53:00] that are secured in self- custody it's a
[53:03] massive amount of Bitcoin um so yeah I
[53:06] think when when unchain was was being
[53:09] founded we were you know our Founders
[53:11] looked at the hotle waves and they're
[53:12] like wow people are holding Bitcoin for
[53:13] the long run and then they were
[53:15] considering this it's the same story
[53:18] even back in 2016 2017 when we were
[53:21] founded the largest number of users were
[53:24] with custodians with the most Bitcoin
[53:26] was in self- custody and same thing is
[53:28] true today and so that's why they
[53:31] founded the company with this idea of
[53:33] collaborative custody where clients can
[53:35] still control keys but unchain is there
[53:37] as a partner to guide you through the
[53:39] whole process you can you know if if you
[53:42] run into any issues you can use unchain
[53:44] key and then we're able to offer all
[53:46] those different Financial Services like
[53:47] the retirement accounts and trading and
[53:49] loans and so on uh really cool um for
[53:53] the end routine in our podcast we have
[53:55] an end routine where the previous guest
[53:56] is is asking a question for the next
[53:58] guest actually without knowing the next
[54:00] guest is so it's like a question not
[54:04] tailed to the next question guest uh and
[54:07] the previous guest was uh Roman from
[54:09] from El Salvador from the Bitcoin Beach
[54:12] and early early guy there uh and he had
[54:16] actually two question the first one was
[54:17] a quick one when I visiting El
[54:22] Salvador I was just looking at flights
[54:26] uh this week so I I don't have a date
[54:30] but I absolutely must visit I actually
[54:34] was getting really excited I saw on
[54:36] Twitter this guy who was walking through
[54:39] a a mansion in El Salvador he was
[54:42] showing off the different rooms and how
[54:43] cool it was and I was comparing that to
[54:45] housing prices here in Austin and I was
[54:49] like that's that's actually pretty
[54:51] reasonable so yes it's very high on my
[54:53] list of places to visit I don't a
[54:56] specific date yet I'll I'll I'll
[54:58] certainly make it down for a conference
[54:59] within the next year or two yeah I will
[55:02] be there if like 80% sure at adopting
[55:07] Bitcoin in November I think she it is uh
[55:10] so that I think will be a because I also
[55:13] have not been there but I definitely
[55:14] want to visit and his second question Al
[55:17] this last question of the podcast is
[55:18] like uh like kind of obvious with you
[55:22] but what are you doing for Bitcoin what
[55:24] is your value that you add to bitcoin
[55:27] and then like in for Humanity because
[55:29] you add it for
[55:32] Bitcoin first of all great questions
[55:35] both of them are are
[55:38] awesome yeah I mean I've
[55:40] devoted I've worked professionally in
[55:42] Bitcoin since 2017 and primarily focused
[55:45] on putting private Keys into as many
[55:48] hands as possible so even before I
[55:51] worked at unchain I was you know
[55:53] Consulting with other multi-state tools
[55:56] and mobile wallets and I really think
[55:59] that my greatest contribution is
[56:02] promoting this concept of self- custody
[56:04] and I've been doing it now you know I
[56:06] think this is my fifth year at
[56:08] Unchained I also have personally
[56:11] onboarded hundreds of individuals and
[56:14] businesses to controlling Keys like
[56:16] literally set up Hardware wallets and
[56:19] built multi- syn vaults so reflecting on
[56:23] my time I think that's my biggest
[56:24] contribution is getting as many private
[56:27] keys out there into the world as
[56:30] possible we released a statistic uh
[56:33] recently in a Bitcoin magazine interview
[56:35] with our CEO Joe
[56:37] Kelly the 990,000 Bitcoin plus that
[56:40] we're helping to secure on our platform
[56:42] is secured with over 12,000 Keys pretty
[56:45] incredible like if you think
[56:48] about that 12,000 Keys 90,000 Bitcoin
[56:52] compared
[56:53] to a coinbase for example 2 million
[56:56] Bitcoin how many
[56:59] keys five three
[57:03] 10 I don't know
[57:05] one it could be one it literally could
[57:08] be one we don't know uh what so yeah
[57:11] that's uh that's kind of my biggest
[57:13] contribution yeah it's it's also
[57:15] fascinating you see that everybody's
[57:17] custodian with with fun Bitcoins with uh
[57:20] coinbase almost everybody like Fidelity
[57:23] has self custody some some others but
[57:25] the major already has coinbase which
[57:27] makes a big Honeypot like I'm I'm let's
[57:30] see if someone uh gets into the Honeypot
[57:34] uh I I don't hope so but yeah could be
[57:36] something tour deester had a great quote
[57:39] about this recently which is Bitcoin is
[57:42] one of the least risky assets that you
[57:44] can own if you're controlling the keys
[57:46] and doing it
[57:47] well and the Bitcoin ETFs are probably
[57:50] the riskiest ETFs that have ever existed
[57:53] simply because of the centralization
[57:55] problem there's one custodian for 10 of
[57:58] them what happens if that custodian runs
[58:01] into issues how much I mean I wouldn't
[58:04] personally be able to sleep at night uh
[58:07] knowing that significant wealth was
[58:09] centralized in in that form or fashion
[58:11] but I probably spent a little bit too
[58:13] much time working in Bitcoin with keys
[58:16] so I might be a different uh different
[58:19] perspective definitely so thank you for
[58:22] being on thank you for digging the time
[58:23] fill uh before I let you go where can
[58:26] people find you like where can people
