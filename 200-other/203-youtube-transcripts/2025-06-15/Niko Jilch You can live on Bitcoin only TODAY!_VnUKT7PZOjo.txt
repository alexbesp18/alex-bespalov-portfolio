[00:00] it's a dysfunctional centralized system
[00:02] that is failing things are going so well
[00:04] it's kind of frightening if you want to
[00:06] live in a Bitcoin only world you can
[00:07] design it yourself you can live in a
[00:09] Bitcoin only world today it's better to
[00:10] build something and to fight something
[00:12] and it's actually nice of the central
[00:14] bank system to fight Bitcoin because
[00:16] they give it their energy and their time
[00:17] they buy some shitcoin because they
[00:19] still didn't get over their own ego and
[00:21] they still think that they are smarter
[00:22] than the neighbor who bought Bitcoin
[00:24] it's a very very clear statement by the
[00:26] financial Giants of the world that
[00:28] Bitcoin is a real thing it Li to you it
[00:30] makes you believe that your stocks go up
[00:32] when they're actually flat that you are
[00:34] smart for buying the house when it's
[00:36] actually flat the real challenge is not
[00:38] to get out of the red race the real
[00:40] challenge is what are you going to do
[00:41] with your life afterwards some people
[00:43] are starting to figure out that there is
[00:45] a way to live your life that is not
[00:46] driven by the inflation
[00:51] machine I saw your talk at Bitcoin prag
[00:56] about the seven Rebellion lessons or
[00:58] something like that uh the Eastern
[01:00] European Revolution and what I thought
[01:03] is like is that the best time to compare
[01:06] Bitcoin with the Bitcoin Revolution uh
[01:09] because it's like from the past we can
[01:12] learn maybe a little bit of Bitcoin and
[01:14] maybe then get to the Future what will
[01:16] happen the next like 5 10 20 years uh
[01:19] and that's how I wanted to structure
[01:21] today's podcast so maybe like what can
[01:23] we learn from the past is that time
[01:25] frame the best time to compare the
[01:26] Bitcoin Revolution to it's it's one one
[01:30] time frame right it's one time frame
[01:31] that we know a lot about um and it's one
[01:34] time frame that that makes a lot of
[01:36] sense to talk about in Prague um there
[01:38] is no perfect comparison there's just
[01:42] small um or maybe large um you know
[01:46] similarities so one thing that I think
[01:48] is is is funny is numbers when in 1980
[01:51] when um solidos was founded before it
[01:54] was even founded so that would be the
[01:55] the the Polish Union free Union the
[01:59] funny thing about about the the
[02:01] revolution um and the Rebellion against
[02:03] against Soviet Russia and the Soviet
[02:05] Union is that the Soviet Union was
[02:07] supposed to be a workers Paradise but
[02:09] the people who brought it down was
[02:11] actually the workers the actual first
[02:13] workers Revolution was in 1989 and the
[02:16] 1980 the workers began with very modest
[02:18] stuff like um higher wages better
[02:20] maternity leave more security very very
[02:23] basic stuff and they had a list of of
[02:26] Demands and you now I ask you do you
[02:29] know how many demands they had uh I have
[02:32] no clue 21 21 of course oh of course it
[02:36] was 21 and so they had 21 demands and
[02:39] then and then they were um uh after a
[02:42] couple of of weeks of the you know the
[02:45] Polish state came back with a police
[02:47] state and for almost 9 years they were
[02:48] illegal so arish was illegal it took
[02:50] them nine years um but it's all started
[02:53] in the in the L in the lon Shipyard in
[02:55] what is today Dans um German name is
[02:58] dank right so so and and I I just I
[03:02] bought a book about 1989 by Victor
[03:05] Sebastian who is a brilliant historian
[03:08] British guy whose family fled from from
[03:10] Hungary uh and I bought that in Budapest
[03:13] and I just read it in two days and it
[03:14] was a brilliant you know um overview of
[03:17] what happened not in Russia but in
[03:18] Eastern Europe and there are some
[03:20] similarities so for example um one
[03:23] similarity would be that the core of the
[03:25] system so that would be Moscow was not
[03:28] interested in keeping the satellite
[03:30] anymore they they were interested in
[03:31] keeping their stuff but they are they
[03:33] thought that they could reform the
[03:35] Soviet Union in a way where where they
[03:36] would stay in power no and and at the
[03:39] same time the people running the
[03:41] rebellions in in in in Hungary in um in
[03:44] Poland in Czechoslovakia um they didn't
[03:48] think about you know bringing down the
[03:50] power they just wanted a little bit more
[03:51] rights they wanted to make their lives a
[03:53] little bit better um and it all ended up
[03:56] with you know easn Germany with the wall
[03:58] coming down and then this
[04:00] afterwards it looks like a foregone
[04:01] conclusion right but it wasn't it was
[04:04] never um and I think
[04:06] that when I started my work on this I
[04:09] thought that we could learn something
[04:12] from like the rebellion and the
[04:14] revolution but now I think what we
[04:17] actually can learn is that you know
[04:18] what's really important is and this also
[04:20] one of the lessons that VAV har talked
[04:22] about what's important is that you have
[04:24] an alternative that you have something
[04:26] to strive for that you have um a life
[04:29] that you want to live and somewhere
[04:31] where you want to go and I think that in
[04:33] the in the when you compare it to what
[04:35] we have today the Fiat system let's call
[04:38] it the fat system whatever it's it's a
[04:41] it's a dysfunctional
[04:43] centralized system that that is failing
[04:46] basically that's and that was the was
[04:48] the Soviet Union was as well um you need
[04:52] some Alternatives so in the in in the
[04:54] case of Eastern Europe the alternative
[04:55] was Western Europe in the case of like
[04:58] classic socialism the alternative was
[05:01] capitalism today it's a little bit less
[05:03] clear and without Bitcoin I don't think
[05:05] we would have an alternative but with
[05:08] Bitcoin we can slowly see an alternative
[05:10] emerging and we can see it emerging all
[05:12] around us within this very very small
[05:15] Bitcoin space and I think it's important
[05:17] to know that it's still very small it's
[05:19] not early so Bitcoin is 15 years now
[05:21] it's not early but it's still small um
[05:24] but I can see the alternative within the
[05:26] Bitcoin space I can see it within the
[05:28] the and and and then of course like in
[05:30] practice I can see it with for example
[05:33] Michael saor does right she does the
[05:35] same thing that many people do on the
[05:36] personal level um they put their their
[05:39] their savings into Bitcoin he does the
[05:41] same thing in um in on the corporate
[05:43] level right and now the Playbook is
[05:45] playing out and there's more companies
[05:46] doing it and they're successful um it's
[05:49] actually you know things are going so
[05:51] well it's kind of frightening
[05:53] almost is is is there possibility
[05:56] Bitcoin at some point goes too fast I
[05:58] thought about that when when we really
[05:59] really hit like a a point where Bitcoin
[06:02] the price goes so parabolic can it can
[06:05] this be something frightening for for
[06:08] Bitcoin and the overall mission yes I
[06:09] think it I mean it's it's frightening
[06:11] when it goes up and it's frightening
[06:12] when it goes down that's the volatility
[06:15] um and when there's when there's um
[06:17] exponential growth it's always it it
[06:20] always comes down right um that's why
[06:23] I'm very interested in in the whole
[06:25] power law thing I it's hard to talk
[06:27] about quote unquote price Model because
[06:30] because you know there is this this all
[06:32] your models are going to be destroyed
[06:34] and you know some models are use some
[06:36] all models are wrong and some are useful
[06:38] I I can see that right but but I like
[06:41] like the idea of having something that
[06:43] works as um um um
[06:48] almost a digital organic life form
[06:51] because because that's what it is it's
[06:52] it's it's a network right and the
[06:54] network is is is composed of the nodes
[06:56] but the nodes in Bitcoin is not just the
[06:57] little computers it's us right um and it
[07:01] would make sense for for a system that
[07:04] is adopted by by human beings um to be
[07:07] to be growing like something out of
[07:09] nature that's the whole power law idea
[07:12] um and as long as the power law thing is
[07:14] not invalidated I think it's a very
[07:15] interesting thing to look at um and if
[07:18] it gets invalidated then we can do
[07:19] something else right um and and the one
[07:22] thing about the PA is that it also shows
[07:25] the path of least resistance and the
[07:27] path of least resistance is not you know
[07:29] jump In from from 8 70,000 to 7 million
[07:33] and then just saying okay that's it now
[07:34] it's not 7 million right that's not the
[07:36] the power Le resistance the PA
[07:37] resistance slow growth maybe a little
[07:39] bubble then coming back down you know as
[07:41] a Bitcoin that's interesting it goes up
[07:43] to 300% and then it comes down 70% um
[07:48] and and most people are still in the
[07:49] green um but but like uh people who are
[07:53] never heard about Bitcoin will will pity
[07:55] you will say ah you're poor boy did you
[07:57] lose everything are you okay you know do
[07:59] you want a
[08:00] soup um yeah so so so I don't like I
[08:06] think I'm very intrigued with the power
[08:08] law thing because I think it's the more
[08:09] natural um slow slow progression is
[08:12] actually a good thing and the power law
[08:14] uses the US dollar to measure things
[08:16] like it's it's it's kind of like uh
[08:19] denominated in the US dollars do you
[08:21] think that the US dollar then survives
[08:24] or maybe the power loord then breaks
[08:25] when when the field system uh breaks or
[08:28] does the field system never
[08:30] break
[08:33] it I don't like if it if it breaks if it
[08:38] disappears so be it um I'm not going to
[08:41] you know cry about it but I I also I
[08:43] think it's
[08:45] not it's not helpful to think in these
[08:47] terms I do think that but when the when
[08:49] the Soviet Union came down you know the
[08:52] government still existed many people
[08:55] actually many people were super
[08:56] disappointed because the same people who
[08:57] were in power during the times were
[09:00] still in power you know um the the lives
[09:03] of the people didn't immediately get
[09:05] better um so so it took it took time
[09:09] right and of course it's an imperfect
[09:11] comparison but um it's
[09:14] it's I I I I still have a hard time
[09:18] thinking that you know Bitcoin will be
[09:20] the only money that we use maybe maybe
[09:23] you know I'm not going to complain um
[09:25] but I don't I still like I factor in the
[09:28] Fiats system I factor it in into my
[09:31] thinking it's part of the the the
[09:33] organizational structure of governments
[09:36] um they will have to adopt to bitcoin um
[09:40] there is a new a new um you know
[09:42] counterweight in town that they will
[09:44] have to deal with which is positive and
[09:46] I think that anybody who is who who
[09:48] knows anything about monetary economics
[09:50] even within a central bank is going to
[09:52] be happy about that so they're going to
[09:54] embrace it because because it's it's
[09:56] they don't know any other way out you
[09:58] know there is for for monetary system
[10:00] today the only way out is is is complete
[10:02] disaster um so so it's good to have
[10:05] something that that that uh that that
[10:08] you know can absorb all the the the debt
[10:11] all the money printing you know
[10:12] something that that can work as a
[10:13] counter way to the
[10:15] system but it's for me it technically
[10:19] it's possible that we that that we just
[10:21] get rid of the the Legacy Central
[10:23] banking system and and it might even be
[10:25] desirable but it's very hard for me to
[10:28] to like picture it
[10:29] it's interesting because some people say
[10:31] like oh Bitcoin can only like there are
[10:33] a lot of camps in inside of Bitcoin like
[10:35] some like if if Bitcoin does not uh
[10:37] replace the C Central banking system
[10:40] then Bitcoin was not successful then
[10:42] some people say like oh the central
[10:44] banking system will always be there but
[10:46] Bitcoin can be successful even without
[10:48] that like if if Bitcoin does not replace
[10:51] the central bank system completely then
[10:53] the central banking system still solves
[10:55] a problem that Bitcoin cannot solve M
[10:58] like like
[10:59] even with dictators in power even with
[11:02] with laws you cannot
[11:05] force you cannot force complete
[11:09] idiocracy um idiocy you cannot force
[11:11] complete idiocy onto the people forever
[11:14] you can do it for a while right like
[11:16] like they did in the beginning of the
[11:17] Soviet Union you know they had no prices
[11:18] ghost plan and all the the very very bad
[11:21] you know planning economy stuff they
[11:23] really quickly realized that that is a
[11:25] stupid idea and they they absolutely
[11:27] knew that the whole uh Marx leninist
[11:30] social structure is complete nonsense at
[11:32] the like 70s 80s right they started
[11:35] actually using it against their enemies
[11:37] right to sub the enemy with the same
[11:40] nonsense um but it's
[11:43] it's if like Bitcoin hasn't failed if if
[11:47] if there is still Central Banking
[11:48] because there's Central Banking today
[11:49] and Bitcoin hasn't failed right so it's
[11:51] like there's no this is all a process
[11:53] people need to stop thinking in in in in
[11:57] events you know there's like that's
[11:59] that's why that's why people get get
[12:01] very very very um you know unhappy in
[12:03] marriages because because there's people
[12:05] who think that marriage is an event you
[12:07] know that you have a wedding no the
[12:08] wedding is the event but the marriage is
[12:09] the process and the wedding is one day
[12:12] and the marriage should be like 50 years
[12:14] right and that's the same thing same
[12:15] thing with Bitcoin it's not there's
[12:18] no one day event where you you go to
[12:21] sleep and next day it's a Bitcoin only
[12:23] world that's not how it works if you
[12:24] want to live in a Bitcoin only world you
[12:26] can design it yourself you can live in a
[12:28] Bitcoin only world to
[12:30] um and some people do that and I appla
[12:31] them it's it's an amazing
[12:34] thing how does is Bitcoin now already
[12:37] successful like when we look at uh
[12:39] Bitcoin is uh here and it's an
[12:41] alternative it's this exit wve that we
[12:44] already have we can already live in kind
[12:46] of a Bitcoin only World depending on on
[12:48] where you're located but you can move
[12:49] somewhere you don't have to pay taxes
[12:51] for Bitcoin depending on where you live
[12:53] is is is it already successful and now
[12:56] it just getting more success like it
[12:58] just wins more wins over time so it kind
[13:01] of Bitcoin is already has already won in
[13:04] actual sense not only the meme it
[13:06] depends on your definition of winning
[13:07] exactly right it has it has one as in so
[13:10] far as that it's it's a global
[13:12] phenomenon that is adopted by millions
[13:13] of people around the world it's a global
[13:15] brand yeah it's on your T-shirt right
[13:17] why is it on your T-shirt because it's a
[13:19] positive Global brand that anybody can
[13:21] use for marketing reasons right um of
[13:24] course if you if you if you cannot back
[13:26] it up with some you know Bitcoin related
[13:28] stuff that you do content Technologies
[13:30] you use and it's worthless but it's a
[13:32] global brand like people will know about
[13:34] it even if they have negative feelings
[13:36] about it even you know even if they hate
[13:39] it they they you know they put their
[13:41] energy into hating it right um that the
[13:44] central banks right about it all the
[13:46] time that that the financial media is
[13:48] completely obsessed with it and it's not
[13:50] even like at the next step of the way
[13:53] yet right the bull market is basically
[13:55] just starting so and and then of course
[13:58] the the Practical for stuff I can go
[14:01] anywhere in the world right now and I
[14:03] can you know um use Bitcoin to get stuff
[14:07] I'm not talking about buying stuff in
[14:08] Bitcoin I'm talking about changing
[14:10] Bitcoin to the local fat currency and
[14:12] using the local fat currency I can meet
[14:15] bitcoiners all around the world I think
[14:16] Bitcoin is is is an amazing social
[14:19] network right um and and I can meet
[14:22] bitcoiners all around the world and all
[14:24] of them will be happy to take my SS and
[14:26] pay for my beer right I can can imagine
[14:30] the the alternative especially when you
[14:31] look at at at at people you know fleeing
[14:34] Eastern Germany to Western Germany or
[14:37] people fleeing the Ukraine for for
[14:39] Western Europe and that's only two years
[14:41] ago you how many people could take their
[14:44] houses how's your real estate investment
[14:46] going right and and it's not funny
[14:48] because it's a war but it's a it's
[14:50] reality um and even if you if you have
[14:52] your money in Gold yes you can take a
[14:55] kilo or two yeah you can take your you
[14:57] you can take your expensive car you can
[14:58] take take maybe some some art right um
[15:01] but nothing compares to what you can do
[15:03] with Bitcoin it's it's it's a completely
[15:06] ground groundbreaking technology it took
[15:09] me from 2013 to 2020 to
[15:15] even accept that right there's like like
[15:19] it's it's so new that that there is a
[15:21] there is even if you if you already know
[15:24] about the problems of fat money about
[15:25] the problems of inflation you can still
[15:28] have lots of assistance um and we always
[15:30] talk about how you know you have to get
[15:32] over your ego sometimes you have to get
[15:34] over your ego more than
[15:36] once um and and and yeah and then that's
[15:41] why so many people after they get it
[15:43] finally it all goes very quick with them
[15:46] right it was very quick for me right so
[15:48] now I do Bitcoin content all the day all
[15:52] every day all day long from 2013 to 2020
[15:55] you did uh in traditional Finance like
[15:58] you were Financial Jal I was working at
[16:00] the newspaper depressive classical
[16:02] liberal newspaper in in in in
[16:05] Austria um it's very old you know lud
[16:08] wrote for it but also Kyle Marx oh so so
[16:12] yeah very open um but but I was there
[16:17] and yeah so so I I like I got into
[16:20] Financial journalism because of
[16:22] inflation and because of fat money that
[16:24] maybe that's an interesting story so I
[16:26] got into it because I I I lived in
[16:28] Argentina for a year in 2008 I saw
[16:31] inflation I saw the problems um and then
[16:34] when the the the Euro crisis started in
[16:37] 2010 um when Greece had to be bailed out
[16:39] and basically you know the the whole
[16:41] idea of the Euro as a hard currency was
[16:44] was completely destroyed um I was
[16:47] panicking so I I would run to the bank
[16:49] and get gold right but what I didn't
[16:51] realize back then is that you know these
[16:53] things take a long time and there's not
[16:55] going to be like inflation did not hit
[16:58] immediately it took until
[17:01] 2022 almost um after the pandemic to
[17:05] really to really hit the streets and now
[17:07] it's only beginning so it's now we now
[17:10] we are at the point where Argentina was
[17:13] in 2008 some some something like that
[17:16] right so but I got into so I saw the
[17:19] problems um and I got into gold and I I
[17:22] I I recreated or re reengineered what I
[17:25] did with my gold buying um and I got
[17:28] into aan economics and all that stuff
[17:30] and and I just you know grew up in the
[17:34] whole crisis you know there was Zero
[17:35] Hedge and Twitter and all that stuff but
[17:38] it was but there was no Bitcoin content
[17:41] back then not really um and and I was
[17:44] too quick to get into the gold story and
[17:46] then I had this mental block so first
[17:49] you know you think fet money is going to
[17:51] go going to go away and we're going to
[17:52] do gold again and then you think the
[17:54] gold standard is the the next step and
[17:56] then you realize but the gold standard
[17:57] is stupid um and actually it's better to
[18:00] and this is interesting this is the free
[18:02] gold Theory it's something that I put a
[18:04] lot of work into um it's a theory that
[18:06] also is is something that Central
[18:08] Bankers understand is that you you you
[18:10] separate the roles of money you do you
[18:12] do Fiat money for every every day
[18:15] transactions and also unit of account
[18:17] most of the time and you take gold as a
[18:20] store of value when you leave in
[18:22] Argentina you understand immediately
[18:24] because you take the PES off for every
[18:26] day and for unit of account and you take
[18:28] the dollar for store of value right but
[18:30] when you live in the dollar world and
[18:32] the Euro world you don't have another
[18:34] Fat currency as a store of value so you
[18:35] have to look for gold maybe that was the
[18:38] idea that was also what I used and
[18:40] actually worked pretty well as a store
[18:41] of value to be to be fair right um but
[18:44] Bitcoin of course technically is a lot
[18:46] better it just took me a couple of years
[18:49] to understand that and once I understood
[18:51] it um I just had to you know face the
[18:54] fact that I could have you know like
[18:55] like every Bitcoin we we could have
[18:57] bought much more much sooner um so now
[19:01] instead of you know um sitting on an
[19:03] island counting my Bitcoin I'm sitting
[19:05] here talking to you and it's also it's
[19:06] fine I I'm glad you're talking to me and
[19:10] you're not an OG somewhere in the island
[19:12] um but this is interesting because a lot
[19:14] of people already use Bitcoin that way
[19:15] like they use Bitcoin as the store of
[19:17] value and then uh either they have an
[19:20] income and then they divided like okay
[19:22] 80% or 80% goes to my bills and 20% to
[19:26] my Bitcoin W uh but or or they have
[19:29] actually Bitcoin and then they take
[19:30] something out of that so is that the is
[19:33] that also like how it could be I think s
[19:35] also talks about that that we have like
[19:36] our digital assets we have Bitcoin and
[19:39] then we have our US US dollars or
[19:41] whatever uh how they call it maybe also
[19:44] CBC or something like that and this is
[19:47] kind of then the future where we use the
[19:50] the Fiat money for just for transacting
[19:52] for paying our taxes and and for that
[19:54] and then we have Bitcoin but the thing
[19:57] that I have a really hard time wrapping
[19:59] my head around if everyone accepts
[20:01] Bitcoin as the main store of
[20:04] value and we have even now bitcoiners
[20:07] that are like no I want to pay in
[20:09] Bitcoin and I want to have my my I want
[20:11] to get paid in Bitcoin this is already
[20:13] like slowly happening it's it's not
[20:15] major but what's when like 4% or 5% of
[20:19] the population says like no I I want
[20:21] Bitcoin like so bitco so that's the
[20:24] point the point so when you talk to
[20:26] sailor today and I think he's right when
[20:27] you talk to him today and you say we
[20:29] want to you know bring down the central
[20:31] banking system we want to revolutionize
[20:32] the blah blah blah he says no you know
[20:35] let's not put too much pressure onto
[20:37] Bitcoin let's not to put too much
[20:38] baggage onto Bitcoin and also if you
[20:40] really want to bring down something why
[20:42] would you you know make a podcast about
[20:45] it right why why you're not going to
[20:46] like if if you want to burn down a
[20:49] village you're not going to run there
[20:51] and and show them the fire and then say
[20:52] that's like his his his uh uh uh example
[20:56] we don't want to burn down anything we
[20:57] want to build something better something
[20:59] something new right and this is also
[21:01] something that I learned with with gold
[21:03] a little bit and also from the from the
[21:06] 1989 Revolution Eastern Europe um the
[21:09] people they didn't
[21:10] say I want to end the German Democratic
[21:14] Republic right I want to like I want to
[21:17] end of course they wanted to ENT stazi
[21:19] but they didn't say it right they said
[21:21] how about we can go to West Berlin for
[21:24] an
[21:24] hour right so they they they open and
[21:28] then they open the wall and now today
[21:30] everybody thinks you know the opening of
[21:31] the war was the end it wasn't the end
[21:33] you know the the the Eastern block still
[21:35] existed for years um and people still
[21:37] thought you know now it's okay which
[21:39] just not going to be like before we had
[21:40] the war you know um it's a process and
[21:42] then of course you only know that the
[21:44] end the end result of it and is the end
[21:47] result possibly that you know the whole
[21:49] world runs on the Bitcoin standard and
[21:51] we use Bitcoin as as as a denominator
[21:53] it's it is possible yes absolutely
[21:56] possible it's just that it's it's I like
[22:00] within the time frame that I think you
[22:02] know um you had you had the brilliant
[22:04] guy rosi on your podcast he's a science
[22:06] fiction author he thinks in a very very
[22:08] long time frame my time frame is a
[22:10] little bit shorter you know so I think
[22:12] in a in a time frame of maybe 10 to 20
[22:14] years so do we see do I think that in 20
[22:17] years we won't have feat currencies no I
[22:19] think we will still have feat currencies
[22:21] I think we might have cbdc and whatever
[22:23] the question the next question is do you
[22:25] use your energy to fight that or do you
[22:28] use energy to build something and I
[22:30] think that the message that sailor
[22:31] sending and also Jeff Bo and I think
[22:33] they're right it's better to build
[22:34] something than to fight something and
[22:35] it's actually nice of the central bank
[22:38] system to fight Bitcoin you know the the
[22:40] Europeans do it because they give it
[22:42] their energy and their time um but is it
[22:46] possible that it ends up in a way where
[22:48] you know the the Wall comes down and
[22:50] then the the evil empire collapses yes
[22:53] absolutely and I won't you know I won't
[22:55] be crying about it but I'm not going to
[22:57] um you know make that my life's mission
[23:00] is the ETF uh the the small wall that
[23:04] that opened up or maybe the El Salvador
[23:06] by what what would you the ETF is Bara
[23:09] so you know Bara in glass norst have you
[23:11] heard about so then in in the thing is
[23:14] that what like in this this very crude
[23:16] picture that you know you have you have
[23:18] the the the center and the center would
[23:20] be for the USI would be Moscow and for
[23:23] for the Fiat world would be Washington
[23:25] right and and so what what the USSR did
[23:29] under gorbachov in the 1980s end of the
[23:31] 1980s is they they re reforms they
[23:34] wanted to make it more livable there you
[23:36] know and per and GL are the words that
[23:38] he used for the opening up of the of the
[23:41] Soviet Union to the world right he
[23:42] wanted to import stuff that people
[23:45] wanted not just stuff but like ideas and
[23:47] Concepts and and and and and and bring
[23:50] them to work and that's basically what
[23:52] the ETF is it's it's it's the
[23:53] centralized feat money Wall Street
[23:55] system saying well if we cannot beat it
[23:58] let's join it right um and it's smart
[24:01] it's from their perspective because when
[24:03] you look at
[24:04] the you talked about Investments right
[24:07] and and and store value what what do we
[24:08] do we buy houses we buy we buy art we
[24:12] buy uh other forms of real estate you
[24:14] know we buy stock portfolios And We Buy
[24:17] Gold right and we all buy it for one
[24:19] reason only store of value that's why we
[24:22] buy it we don't buy it because we're all
[24:24] speculators we we're not you know um we
[24:26] buy it for store value so uh companies
[24:28] like Black Rock have been you know have
[24:31] gotten to an enormous size because they
[24:35] they they have solutions for this need
[24:37] for store of value now Bitcoin
[24:39] challenges this and they have two
[24:41] options option A is we ignore it option
[24:45] b is we we do the same thing that we did
[24:47] with with stocks and other other assets
[24:49] we just put them in an ETF rapper and we
[24:52] can't we don't we can't stop you um
[24:54] investing into Bitcoin but we'd rather
[24:56] have you invest your money with us
[24:59] right um and also for for Black Rock
[25:01] it's there's the other story about The
[25:03] Gold ETF because um Black Rock to this
[25:06] day only has the second biggest gold ETF
[25:09] right um and the biggest gold ETF is
[25:11] State Street because they were the ones
[25:13] who did the work when when the gold ETF
[25:15] was founded in like launched in 2004
[25:18] it's it took years to come up with that
[25:20] because they needed to you know talk to
[25:21] the regulators and tell them how they're
[25:23] going to do it and why it's important
[25:25] and why it's they did the same thing
[25:26] that they did with the ETF for for
[25:28] Bitcoin they did with gold ETF but
[25:30] because they were not the first black
[25:32] wasn't the first their their ETF is not
[25:34] the biggest uh and I I don't think that
[25:36] you know whenever Larry think you know
[25:39] gets up in the morning I think he's a
[25:40] happy man but I think that for for like
[25:42] a split second he thinks about Black
[25:44] Rock not having the biggest gold DF and
[25:46] it makes him a little bit sad right so
[25:48] they needed to be like within the first
[25:51] batch because they knew even if there is
[25:53] 11 ETFs as long as blackw is leading the
[25:55] charge people are going to buy the
[25:56] blackw thing and they
[25:59] it's it's fascinating for me and when we
[26:02] uh talk now about uh the fear system and
[26:05] we say like okay Fe system will will
[26:07] survive at least the next 20 years I
[26:09] even think like I will not outlive the
[26:12] Fe system I think as long as I'm here
[26:14] the feed system will be in some sort of
[26:16] sense here um but then there's a whole
[26:19] as you said store value side There's
[26:21] real estate there stocks there's so many
[26:22] other things and I was in stocks before
[26:25] and the one thing that I got forgot
[26:27] about the mention in the podcast that I
[26:29] did before with you is that I was
[26:31] actually in plans before I discovered
[26:33] Bitcoin to make my first real estate
[26:35] investment of course obviously of course
[26:38] I was you had like €200 in stocks now
[26:41] it's time to buy real estate
[26:43] exactly uh and uh Bitcoin actually
[26:47] prevented that and Bitcoin forced me to
[26:50] or forced me or incentivized me to not
[26:53] have my stock investment anymore so
[26:55] without Bitcoin I would have now a stock
[26:58] pfolio and then real estate in portfolio
[27:00] and maybe maybe a small gold portfolio I
[27:03] don't know uh but it's important to
[27:05] understand that you there would be still
[27:06] be better than 95% of the population
[27:08] because they don't have a portfolio they
[27:10] have their money in savings accounts or
[27:12] even worse in some scam there's lots of
[27:16] scams right people buy scams people love
[27:18] their scams for some reason um because
[27:21] of greed you know and you also have this
[27:24] this this phenomenon that you know um
[27:28] you see this in Bitcoin as well with
[27:29] crypto so people people will be talking
[27:32] about Bitcoin for years right and hear
[27:34] about it and then see you know maybe you
[27:38] it's going up from 10,000 to 20,000 to
[27:40] 60,000 right and they're like ah
[27:42] maybe maybe my neighbor was right you
[27:44] know maybe maybe maybe I should have
[27:45] gotten to bitcoin and then they get
[27:47] their first you know whatever B bit
[27:50] finex account and what do they do they
[27:52] buy some shitcoin why because they still
[27:56] didn't get over their own ego and they
[27:57] still think think that they are smarter
[27:59] than the neighbor who bought Bitcoin
[28:01] right and they do the same thing with
[28:02] stocks they don't buy Apple they don't
[28:03] buy ETFs they don't buy Facebook they go
[28:06] online with some and and find some you
[28:08] know obscure Canadian biotech startup
[28:11] that's going to cure uh some some exotic
[28:15] red disease right and they think that's
[28:17] going to be the next big thing and it's
[28:19] it's totally normal and I know this
[28:20] because I've done like every single
[28:23] investment um investment uh uh uh
[28:27] mistake in the the book right and then I
[28:30] came back to what I started with which
[28:32] was saving I was saving fear then I was
[28:35] saving gold then I did all the mistakes
[28:37] and now I save Bitcoin but I still hold
[28:40] gold actually so I'm not like I 100% all
[28:45] of gold I because because if Bitcoin is
[28:49] successful I can I can you know uh I can
[28:52] live with the with with the purchasing
[28:55] power loss compared to gold and gold is
[28:57] still going to be better than you know
[28:59] the Euro whatever if you watch or listen
[29:01] to my podcast on a regular basis I'll
[29:03] guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[29:06] and now the most important step is to
[29:09] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[29:12] hardware wallet my personal
[29:13] recommendation for harder wallet is the
[29:15] bit box it's super secure it's simple to
[29:18] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[29:20] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[29:23] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[29:26] with the code Robin at the checkout
[29:29] visit bitbox dos Swiss robobin to get
[29:33] your bitbox and if you really want to
[29:35] bulletproof your self custody setup your
[29:38] security setup and maybe even your
[29:40] citizenship setup you have to talk to
[29:43] the Bitcoin way if you go to the Bitcoin
[29:46] way.com

[29:51] free call where you can dive deep with
[29:54] them if your self custody setup is
[29:57] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[30:00] maybe might be improvable or your
[30:02] digital footprint in general is secure
[30:06] they are the experts in cyber security
[30:09] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[30:12] secure sovereign individual in general
[30:16] the the overall point uh that I tried to
[30:19] make is like will will all the store of
[30:22] value or like the majority of the store
[30:24] of value then go to bitcoin when most
[30:26] will discover what we both
[30:32] discovered and well I don't know if it's
[30:34] going to be the majority but it's going
[30:35] to be a very very big part yes I do I
[30:38] this is this is something I do believe
[30:39] in yeah because it is just for this it's
[30:42] better if we can if we all agree on on
[30:45] on um on gold and on real
[30:50] estate and on the stock
[30:52] market it is better and if you look at
[30:55] the stock market um uh
[30:58] you know in terms of M2 money supply
[31:01] growth it's not even it's a flat it's
[31:03] flat
[31:04] anyway and and and to counteract this
[31:07] monetary inflation a finite digital
[31:10] asset that finds adoption is the perfect
[31:13] solution it's literally the perfect
[31:15] solution so I I do think that we that
[31:18] that a large part of the store value
[31:21] especially the future store value so I
[31:23] don't even know about whatever already
[31:26] is in the other assets right but um you
[31:29] know young people grew up who grew up in
[31:32] a digital world will understand this way
[31:34] better um and yeah yeah I believe it's
[31:38] going to it's going to it's going to go
[31:39] there and this is this is also why black
[31:41] rock has done this right but why they
[31:43] now have the ETF no they don't care you
[31:45] want to buy Bitcoin nice we have an ETF
[31:47] for that you want to buy real estate we
[31:49] also have an ETF for that you want to
[31:50] buy the S&P 500 we have an ETF for that
[31:53] you can stay within you know and the
[31:54] perfect I mean it's it's it's a money
[31:57] printing machine
[31:58] they get money for holding my Bitcoin
[32:01] now of course I know that it's also bad
[32:03] to not hold your own Bitcoin absolutely
[32:05] no question but that's another debate we
[32:08] can have for people who don't want to
[32:10] hold their own Keys Black Rock holds
[32:13] their keys for them holds their Bitcoin
[32:16] and gets a very little like a small
[32:17] percentage and if the price goes up they
[32:20] make more
[32:22] money and it there's nothing really have
[32:25] to do it's like the only people they
[32:26] have to employ is like guys in a room
[32:28] you know looking at the I don't even
[32:30] know what they're looking at and then
[32:32] then the marketing department but with
[32:34] the marketing of course we help them for
[32:36] free so Larry if you want to if you want
[32:38] to you know send us a check yeah you
[32:40] know where to find us we're doing our
[32:42] part for Larry think but but it's an
[32:45] interesting debate self cust and I had
[32:47] this a lot of times on my podcast and uh
[32:50] I I came to this conclusion now and and
[32:52] and maybe we can debate a little bit
[32:53] about that uh that se Casta is great as
[32:56] an option and everyone who has the
[32:58] option should do it or at least try it
[33:00] like at least even if you're like uh 65
[33:03] year old you have a 2 million portfolio
[33:05] and and you don't want to take it out
[33:06] you you want just to stay with black
[33:08] rock you want to stay with your ETF take
[33:10] the
[33:12] €200 uh and buy and and and and and and
[33:15] bit box uh and and try it out like just
[33:18] like move it around just for the
[33:20] knowledge Gap uh and that's really
[33:22] really cool that we have that option but
[33:25] the majority will they ever do the self
[33:28] custody then we have the of course the
[33:30] debate like on the base layer is not
[33:32] that many much space so there will be
[33:34] the people forced out of on on second
[33:36] layers and and third layers well first
[33:38] of all I don't know right when you ask
[33:40] me anything about the future obviously I
[33:42] don't know
[33:46] but I let's let's say
[33:51] this there will be considerably more
[33:53] people holding their own Keys than there
[33:56] was in 20
[33:59] 7 yeah before Bitcoin existed um the
[34:02] fact that it's possible for you to do
[34:05] this literally the same thing that um a
[34:08] nation state would do a very very big
[34:12] fund would do a bank would do um a huge
[34:15] hedge fund would do uh a very rich
[34:18] person would do like literally the same
[34:20] thing if gold is a little bit similar
[34:22] you can hold gold in your own but but
[34:24] it's it's it's there is a little bit of
[34:26] more hurdles than for the rich person
[34:28] for the for the government or whatever
[34:30] right because the government you know
[34:32] they have their their gold vaults right
[34:34] and and they you know I have to pay for
[34:36] that for for the security with my tax
[34:38] money right um and actually when you
[34:40] look at it it's kind of funny um it's
[34:43] actually better for the individual than
[34:45] for the government or the company
[34:46] because for the government and the
[34:47] company you have to find a solution that
[34:49] makes sense with regards to single sick
[34:53] multii um how do you how do you actually
[34:55] handle that right um this is why you
[34:57] know an ETF is so brilliant because the
[34:59] the like it's it's what it's what L Alon
[35:02] said right she said the ETF is is an API
[35:05] that the fat system can plug into and
[35:07] she's absolutely right there's two ways
[35:09] to do this either you teach everyone
[35:11] within the Fiat system how to hold their
[35:12] own Keys you change lots of laws um and
[35:15] how to hold like how does a company like
[35:17] Michael saor hold their own like their
[35:19] own keys and their own coins right um
[35:22] they did it because they understood that
[35:24] if they go first and if they go over
[35:26] these hurdles with custodians then they
[35:29] are going to be quicker than others but
[35:31] if you already have a Treasury System if
[35:34] you already invest into ETFs or in
[35:36] stocks or whatever right then you just
[35:39] now you just have to press the button
[35:40] there's no questions anymore and for
[35:43] this you know not like a a a company a
[35:48] company should like there's very very
[35:50] good reasons why a company would not be
[35:52] holding their own keys because if
[35:53] somebody if blackw loses the keys I can
[35:56] go to court and to Black Rock if I lose
[35:59] my own
[36:00] Keys it's not not a good look right um
[36:04] or even and and I and make myself uh you
[36:07] know people can attack me right there's
[36:09] an attack angle there so it's it's very
[36:11] very understandable um and and that's
[36:14] what I said about the Fiat money system
[36:16] as well if the fat money system still
[36:19] exists it's because it's it still um
[36:23] delivers a solution right if the banking
[36:25] system still exists it still gives the
[36:27] solution there no way this stuff is just
[36:29] forced upon people feed money is is a
[36:32] great solution to many problems
[36:34] especially compared to um what we have
[36:36] 400 years ago at when the bank of
[36:39] Amsterdam was founded because because uh
[36:42] Merchants from all over Europe would
[36:43] come to Amsterdam and exchange goods for
[36:45] currencies and they would have more
[36:46] currencies that that that you know
[36:48] binance offers today right and then the
[36:50] bank the the government of Amsterdam
[36:52] said guys guys let you know let's let us
[36:55] do it and yes of course um you know the
[36:58] government uh uh uh uh didn't do a very
[37:02] good job with fat money I will give you
[37:04] that right even like when you look at
[37:06] the Euro the Euro was supposed to be the
[37:07] best like the best version of f money
[37:10] we've ever seen was the the dut Mar uh
[37:13] and and they just destroyed it right
[37:15] they just gave it away and now and then
[37:17] they put it into Euro and now it's it's
[37:19] gone poof like like in the in the South
[37:21] Park think it's not and it's gone right
[37:23] um so yeah so so so Bitcoin is way
[37:25] better but I don't know about the future
[37:29] um I I I don't like it's very hard to to
[37:32] see a world where there's no like
[37:34] National currencies I don't know it
[37:36] doesn't really matter but with with
[37:38] regard to holding your own keys if you
[37:39] were a bitcoiner you should hold your
[37:41] own Keys should you hold 100% of your
[37:43] own Keys should you or should you have
[37:45] maybe have like a fail save where
[37:46] somebody else holds you know because
[37:49] life is not black and white right I can
[37:51] I can do seven different custody
[37:53] solutions for my Bitcoin and I think
[37:55] that's probably the best idea because if
[37:56] two fail you still have this the five
[38:00] others but I'm not an expert there's
[38:02] like people who are way better than at
[38:03] this than I am you know so absolutely
[38:07] and the ETF is interesting for me
[38:09] because there's this one side where we
[38:10] say like it's the most successful ETF
[38:12] launch ever because of because of
[38:14] inflation because of inflation of course
[38:17] uh but the price uh like I get a lot of
[38:20] comments uh like oh why does the price
[38:23] not move up or I was a week ago in a
[38:26] space and people say uh uh someone come
[38:28] like why does the price is not at 100K
[38:31] or 200k I think it's also like
[38:33] expectation I think Samson Mar was one
[38:35] of the guys who said like in a few weeks
[38:38] when this ETF launched then it will be
[38:40] at a million uh he had some some price
[38:42] targets I don't remember if it was him
[38:45] but uh there's always one guy with a
[38:48] price Target you know there's always
[38:49] guys with price targets and the price
[38:51] targets are never or almost never lower
[38:53] than the current
[38:56] price would be interesting I have to
[38:58] price Target 12K no sure I mean there
[39:00] are idiots like Peter zahan who think
[39:02] it's going to go negative right um but
[39:05] but um but are you disappointed with the
[39:09] ETF launch from a price perspective come
[39:12] later on no no I'm not disappointed no I
[39:15] first of all the price is the price
[39:17] right there's a 100 different factors uh
[39:20] uh what the price is doing and I don't
[39:23] know in media it's always funny right
[39:25] when you when you when the price is
[39:26] moving in Media
[39:27] the the the journalists and you know
[39:30] that the newspapers immediately find a
[39:31] reason right gold demand is up due to
[39:34] the tensions in the Middle East right
[39:36] maybe it's the the Indian wedding season
[39:39] I don't know right it there's always one
[39:41] reasons and it's completely stupid the
[39:43] price goes up if there's more demand um
[39:46] and the price goes down if there's less
[39:47] demand that is it that's the whole story
[39:49] and and and that's where I go back to
[39:52] the power law thing because I think that
[39:54] Giovani who who came up with the concept
[39:56] is very right he says that that
[39:57] basically even in order to go to a six
[40:00] figure U bitcoin price within the next
[40:03] year we need this money at this inflow
[40:06] right it's not like the Bitcoin price
[40:07] just goes up magically because we now
[40:09] have ETFs there is the idea that most of
[40:12] the people who who bought the ETFs are
[40:14] actually you know old old fashioned
[40:16] bitcoiners who now roll their 401ks into
[40:19] Bitcoin into the ETFs and then there's
[40:21] the other idea that the institutional
[40:23] investors aren't really here yet partly
[40:25] they are partly they're not
[40:27] um it's just that that you know we went
[40:30] up from what 30,000 40,000 after we
[40:34] heard about the ETF to about 70,000 and
[40:36] now it's gone sideways I mean what do
[40:38] you want if it's going to if if it goes
[40:41] to 200 within two two two months in the
[40:44] summer of 2024 then the market is
[40:47] overbought and it just will collapse
[40:49] again and and you cannot do anything
[40:51] like if it goes up too fast it will come
[40:54] down and it will go up too fast at the
[40:56] end and it will come down again um but
[41:00] but I'm not disappointed no I'm I'm
[41:03] I'm I think it's a very very uh clear
[41:08] statement by the um Financial Giants of
[41:11] the world that Bitcoin is a real thing
[41:14] and I think that should be enough for
[41:16] for for most
[41:19] people it's enough for me I love it a
[41:22] lot um before we go into the end routine
[41:25] I have one more question that I uh just
[41:27] had in my head um when we talked about
[41:30] the fat thing before and I remembered it
[41:32] now um what is the worst aspect of fat
[41:37] you you studied it a long time you're
[41:39] now in Bitcoin U what what is for you
[41:42] the worst aspect of of the fat world or
[41:45] the fat monetary
[41:49] system the worst aspect of the Fiat
[41:52] system as we know it today it's that it
[41:54] lies to you it it it makes you believe
[41:57] that you know your stocks go up when
[41:59] they're actually flat that you um are
[42:02] smart for buying the
[42:04] house when it's actually flat um that
[42:07] there is something wrong with you
[42:09] because you cannot make enough money to
[42:13] um um care for your family you know um
[42:16] there's something wrong with you because
[42:18] you don't make as much money as the guy
[42:20] next door does right even though he's
[42:22] you know eyeballs into de because he
[42:24] want just wants to impress you right
[42:27] um the the the the the worst thing about
[42:30] the Fiat system is that it keeps you in
[42:32] this in this Perpetual um Loop of of
[42:36] insufficiency right and and and you can
[42:38] never Escape it because because uh or
[42:41] almost never Escape it um and you have
[42:44] to work hard in terms of being an
[42:47] investor to get out of it and this takes
[42:50] enormous amounts of energy uh that could
[42:53] otherwise be used for other endeavors
[42:54] like science or Arts you know um um so
[42:57] that's the worst part and and the the
[43:00] worst effect is that it takes the money
[43:02] from the poor and gives it to the rich
[43:05] and it's and it's the complete opposite
[43:07] of what um you know people who who who
[43:10] complain about this will tell you that
[43:12] it's it's capitalism's fault or it's the
[43:15] even the market economy's fault right um
[43:17] when it's the complete opposite it's
[43:18] because we have a centralized monetary
[43:21] system that just doesn't work um and and
[43:25] and it gets worse you know the now we
[43:28] we're at a point where the only solution
[43:30] that politicians have is more
[43:32] money right so they make it worse with
[43:35] every crisis just gets worse um and and
[43:38] without Bitcoin I would be you know
[43:42] very depressed right now because I
[43:44] really wouldn't know what to do um but
[43:47] the fact is that you know with the
[43:48] information revolution and the computer
[43:50] and all that stuff it's it makes sense
[43:52] that something would come up to solve
[43:55] this actually very solvable
[43:57] problem um it's just that that that it
[44:01] was solved by feat money and then feat
[44:03] money was taken you know by the
[44:05] governments and central banks and turn
[44:06] into something that's really really not
[44:08] very you know productive so so I hope
[44:11] that that was um concise enough for the
[44:14] worst thing about Fiat money uh yeah it
[44:17] was really good I always uh explain uh
[44:20] the difference between feat and and and
[44:22] the Bitcoin standard like feat is
[44:24] running in mut uh and you can still run
[44:26] you can still do something but something
[44:28] drags you down a little bit it's a
[44:29] little bit harder to run uh and and
[44:31] running on a Bitcoin standard it's like
[44:33] just running on a solid street because
[44:35] we also have this like low time
[44:36] preference and I feel like some
[44:38] bitcoiners using low time preference as
[44:40] an excuse to be
[44:42] lazy I don't know I mean the low time
[44:44] preference thing is is is it's great
[44:46] when you discover it that it's actually
[44:48] possible so one of the things like what
[44:50] I said about fat money is also that you
[44:52] cannot have a low time preference
[44:54] because it just it's not possible so
[44:56] that's on on a on a on a
[44:59] societal level um is very bad because
[45:04] that's when you get things like like um
[45:06] um you know you squander your resources
[45:08] you have fast fashion fast food fast
[45:11] everything um and of course you have a a
[45:14] very very powerful nomenclatura within
[45:17] the Fiat system even within the
[45:18] corporate Fiat system who sell you the
[45:19] first fashion the first food and who
[45:21] don't want to change anything about it
[45:23] because they are making good money right
[45:25] um so so I don't know if if if if um the
[45:30] the the time preference it's actually we
[45:32] go with Bitcoin we're going to discover
[45:35] a lot of a many things about time
[45:37] preference I think and and and because
[45:38] I'm a little bit older than you I
[45:40] already like I have already AC crossed
[45:43] the the the the Horizon and I know many
[45:46] like very young bitcoiners between 20
[45:47] and 40 who are like ah we save
[45:49] everything you you still own chairs your
[45:51] Bitcoin right and I get it I get it you
[45:53] know um and I actually I I um I get it
[45:59] but but it's not this is not a permanent
[46:01] thing right in the end Bitcoin is is is
[46:04] is just a number on the screen if you
[46:06] like the the real challenge is not to
[46:09] get out of the red race the real
[46:11] challenge is is what are you going to do
[46:13] with your life afterwards what are you
[46:15] going to do with your time right and we
[46:17] are only at the start of figuring that
[46:20] out I think because because there are
[46:23] like there are signs that people are
[46:25] starting to to
[46:27] think about this right when you look on
[46:29] YouTube you know you have all these
[46:31] motivational gurus right who will tell
[46:32] you you do this you do that you build
[46:34] your business you know and there's good
[46:36] guys and there's very bad guys um who do
[46:39] that but there's definitely a demand for
[46:42] this and part of this is because of Fiat
[46:44] because people don't know what to do but
[46:47] I think the other part is that some
[46:49] people are starting to figure out that
[46:51] there is a way to live your life that is
[46:53] um not driven by the fear like by the
[46:56] inflation machine and a lot of a big
[47:00] part of those is bitcoiners but not only
[47:02] I think that there are other people who
[47:03] have you know maybe you know have a job
[47:06] that pays enough you know if you're an
[47:08] influencer right if you if if you have a
[47:10] big following or whatever um you're
[47:13] you're already out of the red race so
[47:15] there's other ways to get out of the red
[47:17] race than Bitcoin that's what I'm saying
[47:20] um and and
[47:23] and and and and and then you have to
[47:27] realize what am I going to do you know
[47:29] that's that's actually the question and
[47:31] I think we're still at the very very
[47:32] early we're not early with Bitcoin
[47:34] Bitcoin is already 15 years old but
[47:36] we're very very very early when it comes
[47:38] to the consequences of Bitcoin could
[47:41] could be one of the consequences when
[47:43] like we have a Bitcoin standard or like
[47:45] most people save their money in Bitcoin
[47:47] therefore they get to an stage where
[47:50] they can uh have more and more and they
[47:53] have more and more time can we get to a
[47:55] point where we live in abundance
[48:00] I
[48:01] mean compared to any part of human
[48:03] history we already live in abundance but
[48:06] there are many things that are very bad
[48:08] about the system today I mean we still
[48:12] have poverty why why do we have poverty
[48:14] why where is why there is there people
[48:15] flying to the to the moon like on a
[48:17] private chat right and then at the same
[48:20] time we have poverty there something is
[48:21] wrong something is not going right right
[48:24] um but the whole abundance thing it's I
[48:28] mean I don't know I I don't know you
[48:32] know maybe it depends on your definition
[48:35] of abundance right it's like like
[48:36] because today we live a life that's on
[48:38] on on par with like the richest people
[48:41] 150 years ago maybe maybe not like maybe
[48:44] 200 years ago but our life is pretty
[48:46] good I think but but and and and and
[48:50] this is thanks to let's make no mistake
[48:53] this is thanks to the market economy and
[48:55] in in parts to in here in Europe we do
[48:58] have a social system that is very you
[49:01] know in theory it's very good as long as
[49:04] the market economy is bigger than the
[49:06] rest you know if as long as there's more
[49:08] money made and spent
[49:11] but we know from haek that's and and
[49:14] from mises and you know it it takes a
[49:16] while but it's never it's it's very hard
[49:18] to to to hold that right because you can
[49:21] print the money and then it just goes
[49:23] poof um and and this is what we see it
[49:26] now so abundance I don't know there is a
[49:31] like let's just say that that I see this
[49:34] with with people within the Bitcoin
[49:35] space and I really believe that we don't
[49:37] know
[49:39] like what people like are even capable
[49:43] to do because because their potential is
[49:46] not tapped and I think that Bitcoin is
[49:48] only a very very small part because we
[49:51] see this from a western and Rich
[49:52] perspective but what about people in
[49:54] Africa and South America and Southeast
[49:56] Asia right so they first they need to
[49:58] get plugged into a hard money standard
[50:01] right that's how I explain it to normies
[50:03] sometimes I say imagine the whole world
[50:05] on the DayM Mark right but better that's
[50:09] Bitcoin right it's a hard money standard
[50:11] that anybody can plug into at any time
[50:14] um and that's completely mindboggling
[50:17] and and like like I said we're only at
[50:19] the beginning of the of the consequences
[50:20] so one of the consequences would be that
[50:22] we see the potential for for growth
[50:24] coming out of Africa coming out of Asian
[50:26] South America um but again I don't even
[50:29] know how long that might take it might
[50:31] take decades to to to you can see it on
[50:34] the person it's very small level already
[50:36] but until you see the positive effects I
[50:39] don't know it will take time it will
[50:41] definitely take time and uh I have a
[50:44] thousand more questions on that topic
[50:45] it's really interesting to talk with you
[50:47] um but I think we are around that one
[50:49] hour mark even though my my watches they
[50:52] stopped working stopped working still at
[50:54] 12 that's that's that's a very that's a
[50:56] way low time preference right you don't
[50:58] buy a new new watch so it's it's it's
[51:01] only right twice a day no no time for
[51:03] Batteries no money for
[51:05] Batteries it's always 12 it's always
[51:07] time for food um my endro consists of
[51:11] two questions the one question is always
[51:12] the same and the other questions is
[51:13] always from the previous guest and the
[51:15] first question is uh what are you
[51:17] currently passionate about besides
[51:19] Bitcoin and I'm always aiming with that
[51:21] question to find out more about
[51:23] bitcoiners so we can learn from each
[51:25] other and and see others
[51:27] other effect other aspects of their
[51:29] lives
[51:31] also
[51:34] golf the beautiful and very very
[51:37] agonizing game of golf where you hit a
[51:40] white ball mostly white balls with a
[51:42] stick around uh a field of
[51:46] grass that's what I'm what I'm yeah it's
[51:50] it's a it's not a laugh haate
[51:52] relationship but it's it's it's proof of
[51:53] work
[51:57] I always love when when you describe
[51:59] sports like that because when you
[52:00] describe for example swimming you just
[52:02] jump in the water till you hit a wall
[52:05] and then you dry back your head wall and
[52:08] it's really interesting so the thing the
[52:09] thing with golf is that this is
[52:11] something that that you know people go
[52:12] crazy about um the ball doesn't move so
[52:16] when you play soccer or you play you
[52:18] play baseball you play basketball you
[52:20] play any kind of of of game with a ball
[52:23] the ball is constantly moving so you are
[52:25] always reacting right you never there's
[52:27] no there's no time to think right you
[52:30] you learn it's like it's like a second
[52:31] it's like your nature right a good
[52:33] tennis player with golf you have time to
[52:36] think and the problem is it's never good
[52:38] to think in sports um and and and you
[52:40] learn a lot about like things like the
[52:42] subconscious right when you when you
[52:44] stand there and you say okay there's a
[52:45] lake do not hit the ball into the lake
[52:48] there's a 100% chance that the ball goes
[52:50] into the lake you have to learn to think
[52:53] I'm going to put the ball next to the
[52:54] lake because you always have to be
[52:56] positive the brain does not understand
[52:58] uh negation right it doesn't understand
[53:01] when you say no and then you realize
[53:03] that the same applies for life and it's
[53:05] very very cheesy it's very cheesy that
[53:08] that's you know but there's another
[53:09] thing that Bitcoin has meant like I saw
[53:10] this on the short I said you know why
[53:13] rich people play golf because they leave
[53:16] their cell phones at home and talk about
[53:18] illegal stuff on the golf course it's
[53:20] very very hard for surveillance to to
[53:22] get you on a very very open field right
[53:25] um now kind of course don't do any
[53:27] illegal stuff but we also don't like um
[53:30] being surveilled all the time um so
[53:33] maybe maybe my subconscious also feels a
[53:35] little bit Freer on on on the golf
[53:36] course I should try leaving the cell
[53:39] phone at home as well but of course for
[53:40] security reasons or whatever you never
[53:43] do I don't have anything you know secret
[53:45] to talk about anyway yeah and I think
[53:48] it's uh there's something beautiful to
[53:50] it just being a nature just be not uh
[53:53] always on the computer and you're
[53:55] getting go out you literally touch grass
[53:58] and actually I like in the last couple
[54:00] of of um Bitcoin conferences I realized
[54:03] especially you know coming from UK and
[54:05] and the US there's many golfers in
[54:08] Bitcoin um and we're now doing the
[54:10] Bitcoin Golf Association the BGA um it
[54:14] basically it's just a tweet that I sent
[54:15] out but that's how that's how project
[54:17] start right so if anybody's a golfer hit
[54:20] me up we'll do like a telegram group or
[54:21] something at the next conference we can
[54:23] do we can go play golf uh that is
[54:26] amazing
[54:27] great um the end is always the previous
[54:29] guest ask a question for the next gu
[54:31] without knowing who the next guest
[54:32] actually is uh and we touched on a
[54:35] little bit but not really do you think
[54:37] that the Haring is priced in and uh you
[54:41] can tell by the question that we talked
[54:42] a lot about the price movements the last
[54:45] episode well the Haring that's already
[54:48] happened yeah the Haring uh he asked the
[54:51] question the Haring that already
[54:53] happened is that uh still priced or is
[54:57] from the harving the movement's coming
[54:59] everything is always priced in that's
[55:02] also like one of those those like
[55:06] um there's no secret that there's a
[55:08] Haring right like literally like the the
[55:11] world media is falling over themselves
[55:13] you know covering oh this event in
[55:15] Bitcoin is happening right now and it's
[55:17] going to send the price no it's not
