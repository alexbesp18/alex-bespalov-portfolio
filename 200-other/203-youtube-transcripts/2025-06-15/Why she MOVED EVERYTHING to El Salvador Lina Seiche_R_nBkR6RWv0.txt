[00:00] as Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender
[00:02] and for for us that's crazy when we see
[00:04] somebody having that high an approval
[00:06] rate our initial and that is propaganda
[00:08] programming by the way our initial
[00:09] reaction is oh that must be fake they
[00:11] have plans they have hopes El Salvador
[00:13] has some of the most beautiful nature I
[00:16] have seen in my life it looks like
[00:18] somebody through an Instagram filter
[00:19] around the country because it's so
[00:21] colorful just started the whole process
[00:23] of moving myself and my company here so
[00:26] you were on the road for 10 years and
[00:29] now it's like the first time you
[00:31] settling down in El
[00:33] Salvador I have since the beginning of
[00:35] my show I don't know if it's really
[00:37] small here uh the little hodler uh it's
[00:40] it's do do you see it I see a be hold on
[00:43] where's your little hodler you didn't
[00:45] wait I have toide of the frame I think
[00:47] it's because we're like our frames are
[00:50] narrowed now you see him right yes now I
[00:52] see him I saw your PIN tweet uh and it
[00:56] was kind of an surprising one to me
[00:58] because it was like with
[01:01] uh where you visited him what's the
[01:04] story behind this like why did you
[01:07] choose that from like I was like I go to
[01:10] your profile and I was expecting
[01:12] something with the little hodler like a
[01:13] story or some like origin stuff little
[01:16] hler in there and the big yeah the
[01:18] little hler is in there yes definitely
[01:20] the story behind the Tweet or the story
[01:22] behind why I made it the pin
[01:23] tweet uh both or both yeah well I'll
[01:29] answer the easy first I made it the pin
[01:31] tweet because that's probably the
[01:31] coolest thing I've done like
[01:34] ever um a story behind the Tweet is that
[01:39] basically I owed him a visit because I
[01:43] met him in Istanbul two over two years
[01:47] ago now that was just after as Salvador
[01:50] made Bitcoin legal tender and it's just
[01:54] like a couple months after and at the
[01:56] time I was starting to make comics about
[01:59] that because that was like a huge source
[02:00] of inspiration it was very easy to do
[02:02] because it was so funny to see the the
[02:05] reaction especially from the political
[02:08] realm and from the the the international
[02:11] media landscape to a nation state
[02:15] adopting bit corn which for us as bitco
[02:17] Corners it's like oh that like that guy
[02:20] is playing out game theory this like for
[02:23] us it was super epic and then uh like
[02:26] some some some critics went and go oh
[02:28] that's just like that's such a small
[02:30] country like who cares right so but and
[02:33] I was really really funny to see how you
[02:36] can how you can have such a skute like I
[02:39] don't know if it's confirmation bias I
[02:41] don't know if it's delusion but you see
[02:44] a country making Bitcoin legal tender
[02:47] and you think it's not a big deal and it
[02:50] started with that that I was making
[02:51] comics about that so most of my Comics
[02:54] they actually pretty much write
[02:55] themselves it's just the depiction of
[02:57] the insanity and and the cognitive
[03:01] dissonance that's going on in the world
[03:05] um yeah so I did that and um I may like
[03:09] actually I think it was under my first
[03:10] comic that I did on the topic somebody
[03:12] was or people were starting to tag him
[03:15] and um that earned me a follow and so I
[03:19] was uh after some time like I was uh
[03:25] like a colleague asked me to pitch
[03:26] something to him so I just kind of cold
[03:28] DMD him never heard back didn't think I
[03:31] would hear back right but like two three
[03:33] months
[03:34] later uh he dm'd me and he said yo I I
[03:39] like I remember that you were in in
[03:40] Istanbul I'm coming to Istanbul do you
[03:43] have some of those hodlers I want one so
[03:47] I had I had one
[03:49] hod because I had just started doing the
[03:51] plushies and I had like I don't know
[03:54] like five prototypes or something and I
[03:57] had one left and so I saved it and and I
[03:59] waited and uh he came in January two
[04:03] years ago on a state visit he was going
[04:05] to see
[04:06] erdan um in turkey and it was the time
[04:10] everybody was going oh he's he's gonna
[04:12] go and he's gonna orange obviously that
[04:14] didn't happen nobody's surpris but so he
[04:16] came and um yeah so I was able to like
[04:20] hop in on that that that
[04:23] whole protocol agenda thing that was
[04:26] going on there and passed him the the
[04:28] hodler so then we had to come
[04:30] conversation um and that was the first
[04:32] time I kind of learned a little bit more
[04:35] about his country and um I got like I
[04:39] found it really intriguing that alone
[04:41] the fact that like I got to meet the
[04:43] president that was really cool and he
[04:44] was very much not like I had thought he
[04:47] would be um in the sense that he was
[04:50] really approachable and
[04:53] really
[04:55] human for lack of a better word not like
[04:58] how you think politician would be like
[05:00] very very very aware very in the moment
[05:03] very very extremely smart and so I
[05:07] thought oh my God I want to see El
[05:08] Salvador like because the entire like
[05:10] his entire Entourage there was so much
[05:12] energy there there was so much like um I
[05:17] don't know like there there there was a
[05:18] lot of um motivation there and a lot of
[05:22] like you felt that there were they're
[05:24] moving things they were moving things
[05:26] forward and doing doing stuff but it
[05:29] took me like a year and a half to do it
[05:32] so that tweet that you see there that is
[05:35] a year and a half later when I finally
[05:38] made it to El Salvador so I was planning
[05:40] my trip and I thought hold on um I have
[05:45] a new little hodler now that's modled
[05:49] after um the president maybe he wants
[05:52] one so I I hit him up again and I hey
[05:56] you want it you say yeah I want it
[06:00] so I got the I got the meeting at the at
[06:03] the at the presidential house and that's
[06:05] how that tweet happened oh that's that's
[06:08] amazing what what like uh what can we
[06:12] like what did you talk with him uh how
[06:15] does he run like the the the country did
[06:18] you get any insights from him uh expect
[06:22] uh accept the whole Bitcoin thing in
[06:26] general yeah yes how how does he run the
[06:30] country runs the country with common
[06:33] sense and that's the thing that threw me
[06:35] off from the first meeting actually so
[06:38] that's the that's one of the first
[06:39] impressions I got is that that's a
[06:42] person who is extremely reflective and
[06:46] extremely um how do you say I said
[06:49] before extremely in the moment how do I
[06:51] how do I
[06:52] better how do I better describe that
[06:55] somebody who knows what's going on and
[06:57] who can see beyond that veil of of of of
[07:01] what we would think is happening so um
[07:05] he has very good a very good
[07:08] understanding and like he can very good
[07:10] understand he has a very good how do you
[07:12] call it people skills there you go and
[07:15] um you can see that he was like
[07:20] pondering the state of his country for a
[07:22] long time because he he went through
[07:25] that whole process of getting into power
[07:28] and then in immediately he turned his
[07:30] country upside down but at like the
[07:34] speed of light which is insane and he
[07:37] has the support of his people uh to like
[07:40] his approval rate is over 90% I think
[07:43] 90 I guess somewhere it always ranges
[07:46] between 91 93% or something and for for
[07:50] us that's crazy because for example the
[07:52] German government right now has
[07:55] 19% rate so it's like so yeah so for us
[08:01] when we see that when we see somebody
[08:03] having that high an approval rate our
[08:05] initial and that is uh propaganda
[08:08] programming by the way our initial
[08:09] reaction is oh that must be fake and
[08:11] then we see the media saying yeah that's
[08:13] because he's a dictator and then we say
[08:14] oh yeah okay that makes sense but he's
[08:17] really popular he's so popular that if
[08:19] you the first time I came here I was
[08:21] like I was starting to meet people
[08:23] talking to locals they would start
[08:25] talking about him without me prompting
[08:28] any questions or whatsoever they are
[08:30] just so proud they're just so energetic
[08:33] and encouraged and optimistic that
[08:35] they're like look we have this now
[08:37] because of the new government and look
[08:40] um we have tourists like you because of
[08:42] the new government so he's really really
[08:45] that popular because he saw the divide
[08:50] in El Salvador so I'm not because I
[08:53] assume most of your viewers are going to
[08:55] be uh from either Europe or the Western
[08:58] Realm
[08:59] um I'm not sure how aware people are but
[09:02] El Salvador was uh El Salvador was in
[09:05] Civil War until 1992 I think um and then
[09:11] from that point onwards basically had a
[09:13] defao bipartisanship so they had two big
[09:16] parties they were constantly like
[09:17] fighting each other it's a bit like what
[09:19] you see in many countries nowadays
[09:23] actually that you have somebody on the
[09:24] left there somebody on the right and
[09:27] then the people in the middle they
[09:28] choose the Lesser evil and so you have
[09:31] this kind of pendulum movement where
[09:33] right now everything's sort of left and
[09:36] people are not happy with that so next
[09:38] time they're gonna go vote for the for
[09:40] the other side the other side is going
[09:42] to mess stuff up stuff up tear down
[09:45] everything that side did um do a bunch
[09:48] of other stupid stuff and then it's
[09:50] going to go back and every time that
[09:52] happens the pendulum swings further so
[09:55] everything is sort of radicalized in a
[09:57] way and nothing happens because
[10:00] everybody just tears each each other
[10:01] down anyway so that was going on and the
[10:05] people of El Salvador increasingly
[10:08] couldn't identify with either of those
[10:10] two parties especially because both
[10:13] parties were like they had huge
[10:16] corruption issues and money disappeared
[10:19] um there was like there was stuff going
[10:22] on between the government and the gangs
[10:25] you know Sao had a huge gang problem um
[10:29] and so it came to a point where actually
[10:32] the majority of the public wasn't on
[10:36] either side but was somewhere in the
[10:38] middle which we're seeing around the
[10:39] world right now which we're seeing in
[10:41] Germany I'm not sure about Austria but
[10:44] I'm not sure about the states I'm pretty
[10:45] sure the states is like that too even
[10:47] though people are very vocal about their
[10:49] political
[10:51] affiliations um yeah but so what najib
[10:54] did is he went and he spoke to that very
[10:57] group he said look I see you you just
[11:00] want a government that fixes stuff for
[11:02] you you don't want far left you don't
[11:05] want far right you just want you don't
[11:08] care about that you just want somebody
[11:10] who tackles your problems and so he
[11:12] spoke to that group and he got extremely
[11:15] popular also because he's really good at
[11:18] social media and all that stuff really
[11:19] good at branding and marketing um and
[11:22] with that he won them over and then you
[11:25] can see in the track record of the last
[11:27] five years that that
[11:31] government did like like it's it's to to
[11:36] to me it's incredible to see because if
[11:39] I look at the last five years in our
[11:42] government or my government I know
[11:44] you're Austrian so but you lived in
[11:46] Germany so it's somewhat your government
[11:49] is um then I'm like why can why can that
[11:53] guy lift his country from most dangerous
[11:56] in the world to one of the safest in the
[11:59] world and one of the most popular
[12:02] tourist
[12:03] destinations and one of the most
[12:05] prominent in
[12:07] headlines and
[12:09] we what what the hell are we doing like
[12:11] we are just like we're just going
[12:14] downhill like we feel so comfortable in
[12:17] our superpower status that we don't
[12:20] realize that we're headed straight for
[12:24] self-destruction so that's yeah I mean
[12:29] there is like the the greater things
[12:30] going on with do you are you familiar
[12:33] with r Dalo and his work on like the
[12:35] changing of the world orders and I think
[12:38] a lot about that and I think like
[12:40] countries like Germany and and also the
[12:43] Western hemisphere in general like
[12:45] America uh they are on definitely not
[12:49] the rise they are more like on the the
[12:51] decreasing side and it's it's
[12:54] interesting to see how now countries
[12:57] that are on the rise like El Sal
[12:59] embracing Bitcoin uh and it and I hope
[13:02] it will be a really positive role model
[13:05] like like now it's really early it's Sal
[13:09] adopted Bitcoin like
[13:10] 2021 it needs a lot of work we're still
[13:13] like in the early phases you still
[13:15] cannot buy as I understand it I was
[13:17] never there as uh not at all stores with
[13:21] Bitcoin like the adoption still needs uh
[13:25] time to grow and so like it will be
[13:28] interesting to see how it is uh turns
[13:30] out like in 5 10 years and we have
[13:33] really a popular role model and you said
[13:35] in the beginning it's a small it's like
[13:37] a small country but it's almost as big
[13:40] as Austria like it's it's uh it's it's
[13:42] still like I think it would be a huge
[13:45] thing didn't want to throw shade against
[13:47] Austria
[13:48] there like Austria could do it like I
[13:51] think not when it's in the European
[13:53] Union maybe I don't know how how free
[13:55] it's it is for that but what's your
[13:58] impression of Salvador outside of the
[14:01] political realm like on on the ground
[14:03] with the people on the market the the
[14:06] nature of El Salvador like what is it
[14:09] like to be in El Salvador in
[14:11] general yeah I'm I'm a I've become a
[14:14] super El Salvador shill like it it's
[14:16] it's actually really interesting because
[14:19] I talked to a lot of experts too
[14:21] everybody sort of has the same
[14:22] impression and there's um an incredible
[14:25] optimism here and you feel that from the
[14:27] time you come and um that's something
[14:30] that I haven't experienced many times
[14:33] before maybe never uh that you feel in
[14:37] the way people tackle things and the way
[14:39] people go about things that they have
[14:41] plans they have hopes for the future
[14:43] whereas we're always like oh great like
[14:46] everything's going downhill and just
[14:47] complaining complaining all the time so
[14:50] here it's extremely different people are
[14:52] very um people are very optimistic about
[14:55] the future and you can tell that's one
[14:57] thing that is like the overall Vibe as
[15:01] the Gen Z says so um El Salvador has
[15:06] some of the most beautiful nature I have
[15:09] seen in my life and not to like brag I
[15:12] seen a lot of beautiful countries and
[15:14] they're like many are beautiful in their
[15:16] own way El Salvador has in my point of
[15:19] view some of the most beautiful forests
[15:23] um like you look as like right for
[15:24] example I can see a I can see a volcano
[15:27] from my window right and it's extremely
[15:30] it's very Lush and green and it looks
[15:33] like I always say it looks like somebody
[15:34] through an Instagram filter around the
[15:36] country because it's so
[15:38] colorful and uh for me the weather's
[15:41] perfect it's always the same temperature
[15:43] it's very like it's close to the quieter
[15:45] so very very nice you have two seasons
[15:47] rain and no rain that's sort of what I
[15:49] got used to over the last decades so for
[15:52] me that's perfect um you have lakes you
[15:55] get from I'm in the capital but you get
[15:58] get down to the beach in 45 minutes or
[16:01] so you can get to the Mount and there's
[16:02] a volcano there you can actually climb
[16:04] that volcano um so that takes like 30
[16:07] minutes to get there they have mountains
[16:09] up north where it gets colder like they
[16:12] I think they told me like 10 10ish
[16:15] degrees Don't Let Me Lie it gets really
[16:17] cold up there then they have did I did
[16:20] mention the Lakes the lakes are
[16:21] extremely
[16:22] beautiful um so that's another thing
[16:25] that's really nice about El Salvador and
[16:27] it's a small country you travel
[16:29] everything very very easily it's I like
[16:31] that too if it feels overwhelming then
[16:34] it's like you get I get lazy to go
[16:36] places but here it's very much not the
[16:40] case and the food is amazing and the
[16:43] people are amazing and yes that's it's
[16:47] really great I love in Salvador you live
[16:50] now in
[16:51] Salvador yes I just moved here actually
[16:54] so I did my trip uh in August I came
[16:57] here to drop off the little president
[16:59] modler with the big president and um so
[17:03] then I stayed for like a week and a half
[17:05] and I completely fell in love with it
[17:07] like I cannot I it sounds so cheesy and
[17:11] I I told it to many people and they're
[17:14] like yeah sure but you're biased because
[17:16] Bitcoin blah but you have to come to
[17:20] like what it happened that then people
[17:22] would come here and they're like oh now
[17:23] I get what you mean so I stayed for like
[17:25] a week and a half then I came back a
[17:27] month later stayed another week and a
[17:29] half realized that's not very efficient
[17:32] because it took like 30 hours each trip
[17:35] um and then I came back in
[17:39] October and because I've been like on
[17:41] the on the road more or less for 10
[17:44] years so for me it's not that
[17:46] complicated to move places it's still a
[17:48] process especially because I have a
[17:50] company now um but for me like as soon
[17:54] as I like made up my mind decided oh
[17:57] like that's the place I want to go
[17:59] then I just kind of went for it so I
[18:00] came back end of October and then just
[18:03] started the whole process of moving
[18:05] myself and my company here so you are on
[18:08] the road for 10 years and now it's like
[18:11] the first time you like settling down in
[18:15] El Salvador if you if I can see that
[18:17] like that yeah I don't know where you
[18:18] draw the line so I've lived in many
[18:21] places um and it wasn't a plan so uh ba
[18:25] basically I wasn't so my initial plan
[18:28] plan what and I planned this when I was
[18:30] 12 so when I was 12 I decided once I
[18:33] finish high school I will move to Japan
[18:37] I was like I had this whole I like I had
[18:40] like two big and I still have them in my
[18:42] in my old in my old room back in Germany
[18:45] two of these big big folders like
[18:47] folders like this and then two of them
[18:50] where I planned how I was going to
[18:52] finance and arrange my move to Japan
[18:55] like I was so set on it I learned
[18:57] Japanese I uh started working so that I
[19:00] could afford the the the
[19:02] travel uh so I did that with
[19:07] 12 well I well at 12 you're not allowed
[19:09] to work I started working at 13 and then
[19:11] at at 18 I finished high school and then
[19:14] I just straight went I did a work and
[19:17] travel thing so I I moved to Japan and I
[19:21] was uh for a while I was doing like
[19:23] waitress job I was flipping pancakes and
[19:26] uh doing those things and I like Japan
[19:28] is a beautiful country it's another one
[19:32] of the like if you look at nature
[19:34] culture architecture
[19:37] music um um Cinema literature philosophy
[19:41] blah blah blah is one of the most
[19:43] beautiful
[19:44] countries I I I know and I've ever seen
[19:48] and I still like it still has that magic
[19:50] for me but for me personal opinion
[19:56] living in the in the work hierarchy in
[19:59] Japan I couldn't I couldn't take it it's
[20:02] a very hierarchical very traditional
[20:05] conservative structure and uh very very
[20:10] like long hours long commutes it's also
[20:14] a very it's hard to get into as a
[20:16] foreigner like get integrated into
[20:19] society as a foreigner even if you speak
[20:21] Japanese so and I like have huge huge
[20:25] respect for people who live their
[20:27] longterm it wasn't for me which was so
[20:30] ironic because I have planned it for
[20:32] like six
[20:33] years um but either way so I had that
[20:36] experience and after that I started
[20:38] traveling it was not planned I just kind
[20:40] of did it and then I started moving
[20:43] around and I more more or less lived
[20:46] in uh different countries for from a
[20:51] couple months to a couple years like uh
[20:54] the Philippines Malaysia Taiwan um and
[20:57] so on
[20:58] and then before
[21:01] um Salvador I was in
[21:04] turkey and I I would you know rent
[21:07] apartments and stuff but I would never
[21:10] feel really settled that makes sense
[21:13] it's like a I don't know I also think
[21:16] the more you do it the more you get used
[21:18] to it right so the more you're like oh
[21:21] so the last five years I moved to a new
[21:24] country every year so then your mindset
[21:26] starts to change you're like okay I'm
[21:28] probably going to live here for a year
[21:29] so you don't start buying stuff uh you
[21:32] kind of live out of your suitcase and
[21:34] then it becomes a self-fulfilling
[21:36] prophecy so that was that 10 years
[21:39] basically then I came here and I thought
[21:42] okay I still don't know how long I'm
[21:44] gonna say right it could still like I
[21:47] could still change my mind but the big
[21:50] difference I feel in El Salvador is that
[21:54] I have a a perspective for a long-term
[21:57] future
[21:58] here because it's a country in upswing
[22:01] rather than a country that's going
[22:03] downhill and that is a huge difference
[22:07] and I cannot communicate this to people
[22:10] unless they've seen it because we're not
[22:12] used to it we're not used to things
[22:16] looking up we are born into the wrong
[22:19] time so to say we are born into like the
[22:21] end of an era the end of an Empire
[22:24] because like FIA currencies are failing
[22:27] entire government are failing um
[22:30] and like I I don't know like it feels
[22:33] like Crisis after crisis and I think
[22:35] it's getting sensationalized too it's
[22:37] getting um boost boosted by social media
[22:41] which is a new factor in the whole thing
[22:43] but it's still bad so we're not used to
[22:46] it then you come here and you see it can
[22:50] be different and that's why I can
[22:55] see right now I don't know I could see
[22:58] myself settling here um and so but you
[23:02] know I take it like I go with the flow
[23:05] it's very long answer to your questions
[23:08] I'm super excited to announce that this
[23:11] podcast just got the first ever sponsor
[23:15] I just started the podcast out like
[23:17] three months ago and now we have 21
[23:20] Bitcoin as a partner for this podcast 21
[23:25] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[23:29] they teach and preach self custody this
[23:32] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[23:36] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from this
[23:38] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[23:42] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[23:45] time support this podcast use code Robin
[23:49] and click the link in the description I
[23:51] think it's uh it's it's an a good state
[23:55] to to be in like uh feeling good in a
[23:58] place where you are uh but being ready
[24:01] to like just move away if it does not
[24:03] feel right um it's it's an interesting
[24:06] experience and I definitely want to
[24:08] start that I'm just not there yet and
[24:11] you started really early with that and I
[24:13] think it gets it gets uh harder with
[24:16] every year you don't do it like you're
[24:19] getting more subtle like you have Roots
[24:21] there and and and stuff there that keeps
[24:23] you here like an anchor that anchor is
[24:25] like self set like you you you could
[24:28] undo it but it's like small stuff that
[24:30] keeps you here because you're used to it
[24:33] and as you said you got used to it not
[24:35] being long in one place so you did not
[24:38] buy a lot of stuff you lift out of your
[24:40] things and if you not used it like you
[24:43] just stay here uh that's an interesting
[24:46] experience and I always have it like
[24:48] when I come from a more beautiful place
[24:51] a more happy place more uh not like I
[24:54] think Austria I think it's a little
[24:56] different than Germany sometimes uh but
[24:59] sometimes it's like you come in the
[25:00] airport and you feel a different wi like
[25:04] it's you you have the different vibe and
[25:06] the mindset of the people uh and there
[25:09] are other places that are that are more
[25:11] beautiful uh than than where Austria and
[25:15] Germany or Austria to something else
[25:18] Austrian and Germany I don't know uh for
[25:21] me it's a little slower in Austria
[25:25] everything uh I mean uh the the more
[25:30] like on a personal basis it's similar
[25:34] when you meet people but I have a lot of
[25:37] different Works in Austria and in
[25:39] Germany and when I talk with German
[25:41] companies like it's they're really uh
[25:44] faster with stuff in Austria so like
[25:48] yeah let's let's see let's see how we do
[25:50] it and then they're more on a how can I
[25:54] explain it they're like H let let see
[25:58] how we can do that in in Germany they're
[26:00] like a little bit more straightforward
[26:02] they're like we're doing
[26:05] that uh it's it's hard to explain for me
[26:09] yeah it's also that voice it's a little
[26:11] bit more chillx it's a little bit more
[26:15] rigid yeah I think that's the the main
[26:18] part but it's it's different like it's
[26:20] always hard to describe that because not
[26:23] every person is like that not every
[26:24] company is like that and just a world
[26:28] Vibe going on yeah yeah I mean you can
[26:31] generalize a little it's these they're
[26:34] they're cliches for a
[26:35] reason
[26:38] definitely and I mean you already
[26:42] answered uh one of my questions I had
[26:44] and I still want to to give it to you
[26:46] because I think it's maybe it's an an
[26:49] different answer uh you traveled a lot
[26:52] you've seen a lot of different places uh
[26:56] maybe besides El Salvador what what was
[26:57] the most amazing place you visited like
[27:00] the most beautiful place where you're
[27:02] like oh here it's really beautiful
[27:04] here from nature Wise from people wise
[27:07] except El Salvador what would you do
[27:09] yeah nature wise I mean I said it right
[27:11] I'm a I'm a huge fan of um Japan in the
[27:15] sense that this country has shaped and
[27:19] maintained a culture Second To None
[27:22] which is insane um like I am ah I'm so I
[27:26] could talk about it forever I'm not
[27:27] going to start um like for living I
[27:31] always say Malaysia and I was actually
[27:34] planning to move to Malaysia when I came
[27:36] to El Salvador so I had applied U for a
[27:40] they they have this new Visa where uh
[27:43] you can apply if you work in blockchain
[27:46] so I said I work in blockchain um apply
[27:49] for the Visa and the application was
[27:51] pending when I came to El Salvador and
[27:53] then I thought oh my god that's way
[27:55] better so I switched plans Malaysia is
[27:59] an incredible country though for the for
[28:01] its people for its um accessibility for
[28:07] its um its its its
[28:11] modernity which people don't really
[28:14] expect um
[28:16] and I don't know it kind of PES
[28:18] Singapore Financial Hub and like super
[28:21] fancy and like going into the future um
[28:24] or going into what they thought the
[28:28] future would look like in the 80s maybe
[28:31] it's a very interesting experience but
[28:33] yeah so Malaysia pales a little in
[28:35] comparison but Malaysia to me at least
[28:37] the capital qual lumor is like Singapore
[28:41] but five times cheaper it's very modern
[28:44] um some of the best food in the actually
[28:46] i' would say the best food I've had in
[28:48] my life I had there because it's a
[28:49] Melting Pot of cultures very high exp uh
[28:55] population amazing vibes
[28:57] I faed in Malaysia for the F so you said
[29:01] the ger Germans were very uh rigid very
[29:06] structured very strict and that is true
[29:09] we're very um generalizing we don't tend
[29:12] to be very spontaneous we have our plan
[29:15] and we don't want to we don't want to
[29:18] step outside of that lane so coming to
[29:21] Malaysia for the first time I was
[29:23] confronted with a completely different
[29:26] worldview everybody is always late
[29:28] everything's kind of kind of chill um
[29:32] and they they taught me like phrases
[29:34] that sort of embody that was really cool
[29:37] um like you would go out in the middle
[29:39] of the night and play batminton on a
[29:41] rooftop um just like for funsies and uh
[29:45] it it was really really like you would
[29:48] randomly get invited to an open house
[29:50] which means somebody literally opens
[29:52] their house and um we would sit on the
[29:54] floor and eat um out of big big uh big
[29:57] pots eat local Malaysian food and they
[30:00] would just let anybody in it's a very
[30:02] different lifestyle and it put things
[30:04] into perspective for me and as you said
[30:07] in like you said earlier I started it
[30:11] really early at a time when you're still
[30:13] very impressionable which is uh in some
[30:15] ways it can be bad and dangerous because
[30:17] being impressionable and being out in
[30:19] the in the in the wide world it can be
[30:23] um it can be a challenge but in another
[30:26] way you are more in general you tend to
[30:29] be more open to accepting different
[30:32] worldviews and cultures and sort of
[30:35] becoming um yourself becoming a more
[30:37] cultured person and that was a
[30:41] huge uh that was a huge lesson for me
[30:44] and from that point on I just kind of
[30:46] fat myself with these different cultural
[30:49] inputs so for me that was a very yeah so
[30:53] Malaysia has a special place in my heart
[30:54] still did did you see while traveling uh
[30:58] different countries like turkey Germany
[31:01] El Salvador
[31:02] Malaysia uh did you see any correlation
[31:05] between what they are thinking in
[31:07] general what they're thinking about
[31:09] Bitcoin and how they are living life
[31:11] especially this like this Bitcoin
[31:13] comparison how they view it oh yeah yeah
[31:15] definitely you can tell from a country's
[31:18] economic status for for example their
[31:20] their General political slash financial
[31:25] situation directly correl Ates with how
[31:27] people experience Bitcoin so for example
[31:30] Germany we're a Savers Nation we like to
[31:33] save money we never dealt with not being
[31:36] able to save money at least not
[31:38] consciously we never had issues with
[31:40] inflation at least not consciously we
[31:43] always felt very uh cushioned and
[31:45] sheltered in our in in our in in our
[31:50] state of being up until the pandemic
[31:52] when Suddenly It's like oh my god there
[31:54] are problems in the world and they're
[31:56] starting to touch us
[31:58] so we look at we look at
[32:02] Bitcoin first of all we like it it's
[32:05] very interesting because Germans tend to
[32:07] be the last to adopt stuff like we still
[32:10] have some of the worst internet
[32:11] connection in the
[32:13] world and like I'm say I've been to many
[32:15] countries right I know so
[32:19] um but we have a huge Bitcoin Community
[32:22] I don't think we would have if it wasn't
[32:25] for the likes of the block trainer Gap
[32:27] guys the I guys and um other people who
[32:31] really like the Bitcoin Hotel people who
[32:33] push Bitcoin on a Grassroots Community
[32:37] level because that it just it just works
[32:40] and now Germany has not not just Germany
[32:43] Germany Switzerland Austria like the
[32:45] German speaking realm has one of the
[32:47] most tight-knit Bitcoin communities in
[32:51] the world from what I know so that is
[32:53] really
[32:54] amazing and uh you can see how people in
[32:57] those communities see Bitcoin it's more
[33:00] like a uh it's like it's a store of
[33:01] value like you put it somewhere and you
[33:04] you leave it for 10 years um whereas if
[33:07] you go to uh the Philippines let's say
[33:10] for example so the Philippines has a
[33:12] very long history with mlms multi-level
[33:15] marketing um and so the Philippines was
[33:18] very vulnerable to to to to coins and
[33:22] tokens that promise the same so the
[33:25] Philippines fell victim to to
[33:27] unfortunately many of those Ponzi
[33:30] schemes because uh like mlms are very
[33:33] big there and it it was a small jump
[33:35] between the two in Turkey Turkey is
[33:38] inflation stricken country uh so in
[33:41] Turkey people try anything to get out of
[33:45] the Turkish Lura so one would think it's
[33:48] it's very turkey's a very interesting
[33:51] example because you are not allow
[33:54] they're getting new regulations now I
[33:55] don't know too much about it but uh
[33:59] currently you're not allowed to pay in
[34:00] Bitcoin so Bitcoin payments are Bann
[34:02] like we famously know that erdogan went
[34:04] oh we're at war with Bitcoin or whatever
[34:07] Bitcoin is not banned Bitcoin payments
[34:09] are banned although I do not know if
[34:12] that was ever enforced which is actually
[34:14] relevant if you and and you know like
[34:16] they they're very like they they have
[34:19] some crazy schemes over there to try and
[34:21] get you to hold L and not dollars
[34:24] because people are fleeing that currency
[34:26] but still as you drive through Istanbul
[34:28] for example you're going to see banners
[34:31] uh Bitcoin exchange um promotions
[34:34] everywhere countless little Bitcoin and
[34:37] uh crypto exchange stores next to like
[34:40] gold exchange stores because gold is
[34:42] also huge there right um and these make
[34:46] billions in volume in dollars it is
[34:50] absolute Insanity it is extremely
[34:52] extremely popular but because money is
[34:55] losing value so so quickly in Turkey it
[34:58] really really quickly like it's a wakeup
[35:02] call I would like to send a lot of
[35:03] Germans over there and see like this is
[35:05] what's GNA happen if you don't if you're
[35:07] not careful like but anyway so so
[35:09] quickly that people try to counteract
[35:12] that really quickly so they also tend to
[35:16] like trading is huge there so I would
[35:18] say the the trading Community if you can
[35:21] call it that is way bigger than the
[35:24] Bitcoin Community because Bitcoin
[35:27] bitcoin's trajectory is up in dollar
[35:29] value and definitely in lra value but
[35:31] not as much as if you go and leverage
[35:34] trade margin trade um some some some
[35:38] some altcoin so those are really huge
[35:40] there so you can tell depending on on
[35:43] where you go um the way that Bitcoin is
[35:47] is seen varies and that's directly
[35:51] correlated to the economy and also
[35:54] politics I'd say it's fascinating I mean
[35:56] a is so close to Switzerland and I feel
[35:58] like Switzerland uh is way more open to
[36:02] bitcoin with Lugano with a lot of things
[36:05] going on even being able to pay taxes uh
[36:09] in in Bitcoin and it would be so close
[36:12] to Austria uh literally On the Border
[36:15] but it's it's it's not coming over and
[36:17] then I think Austria also like when I it
[36:21] was funny because when I started uh
[36:23] getting educated in in Bitcoin uh heard
[36:27] everybody saying Austrian economics I
[36:28] was like there's nothing special in
[36:30] Austria about the economic
[36:32] situation then I to that what happened
[36:36] to that then I heard about AUST
[36:39] economics about the whole thought there
[36:43] uh and about s Mo and then I got
[36:45] introduced in that whole Rabbit Hole uh
[36:48] but it's it's it's funny like I hope
[36:51] Austria can return to Austrian economics
[36:54] one day and and and and and and drive on
[36:57] a like a Bitcoin standard but I think
[36:59] right now it's more more hope and
[37:01] Wishful Thinking than actual reality but
[37:03] let's see where where we are going I was
[37:06] just say I'm not too familiar with how
[37:07] Austria is is handling it it's
[37:10] everything I just know that you had the
[37:14] um onee rule that same that Germany has
[37:18] that if you huddle your Bitcoin for a
[37:19] year the capital gains are taxfree or
[37:22] something like that right but then they
[37:24] got rid of it
[37:27] yeah probably next yeah they got rid of
[37:31] that uh and I think it's just like usual
[37:35] stock with
[37:36] 27.5% uh but yeah I'm not selling
[37:39] anyways um
[37:42] I sometimes when I go before I interview
[37:46] someone especially someone has a big
[37:48] Twitter account and go through like
[37:50] earlier tweets and I found one like
[37:54] 2019 uh and and I was like I was
[37:58] searching for it on Twitter you can have
[38:00] an advanced search and you can like see
[38:02] tweets from like before to 2020 uh and
[38:06] there were like a tweet in there where
[38:08] you talk about like Health uh I don't
[38:11] remember exactly I think you said like
[38:13] something the health is the most
[38:14] valuable thing uh you can ever have was
[38:16] this a time where you already got
[38:20] Bitcoin uh this this something come up
[38:22] with Bitcoin uh or interesting that you
[38:25] bring that up because like oh that is so
[38:27] weird I was just thinking about that
[38:29] tweet a couple weeks ago about how I did
[38:32] that tweet that I was completely out of
[38:35] character because I was doing all these
[38:37] um bullish Bitcoin tweets all the time
[38:40] so I was already a a bitcoiner then I
[38:43] think I said something like yeah your
[38:44] health is your most important asset
[38:48] actually um today when I think about it
[38:52] it might be time I might change it it's
[38:54] time but Health it I mean there somewhat
[38:56] related right if you want more time you
[38:58] need to look after your health I was
[39:00] always conscious of that let's say not
[39:04] always from maybe 18 from around that
[39:06] time was conscious of um health related
[39:10] things because it's just common sense um
[39:14] that if you like if you want quality of
[39:17] life and ideally longer alive it's that
[39:21] is the first thing you have to invest in
[39:23] if you cannot if you don't have your you
[39:26] cannot if you don't you can't take care
[39:28] of yourself how are you gonna take care
[39:29] of other people right so um that's
[39:34] always been very important to me and um
[39:37] it's it's somewhat in in this in in a
[39:41] similar spirit in terms of low time
[39:45] preference because it's not always fun
[39:47] right like going to the gym every day is
[39:49] like so boring um and um well food
[39:54] actually is not an issue because food I
[39:56] I think if you eat really bad that is
[40:00] just lazy because you can train your
[40:02] pallet right so if you always crave
[40:05] McDonald's then you need to go through a
[40:08] like two week adjustment period where
[40:11] you eat healthier and that takes
[40:13] discipline this discipline and from that
[40:16] point onward it's going to get easier
[40:18] because you're G to start craving other
[40:19] things it's like um it's like getting
[40:22] getting off of the the high sugar diet
[40:25] um other things are like making your
[40:28] food yourself not buying processed stuff
[40:31] um and in my experience the more I did
[40:33] it the more I craved it I don't like
[40:35] McDonald's anymore so I don't have that
[40:37] problem but still it's they say you
[40:41] should always invest in yourself first
[40:43] right so or do they say that I don't
[40:45] know but I think you should because
[40:47] everything stems from them yeah so
[40:50] everything stems from that so it's it's
[40:53] it's in a very similar spirit and I've
[40:55] always found it fascinating in a bad way
[40:59] to see how a lot of people when they
[41:01] made it financially so to say they would
[41:03] start letting themselves go or they
[41:05] would um
[41:08] prioritize their their their moneymaking
[41:10] for example over their personal health
[41:14] because what's the point that you can
[41:16] have all the money in the world if you
[41:18] cannot get out of bed in the morning
[41:20] because you're sick then you know and
[41:24] there's there's Universe things there's
[41:25] things that you cannot control but you
[41:27] can sort of
[41:29] steer the the trajectory of that so I I
[41:33] was always very very very into that and
[41:36] um I think it's very important and I
[41:38] think it's better to how do you say in
[41:40] in English to be uh to prevent to try
[41:44] and be on top of things because you only
[41:46] have one body um than to later go oh I
[41:51] should have probably done that
[41:53] differently so yeah yeah it's the I
[41:57] think time and health I mean it's kind
[41:59] of related it's the only thing that's
[42:01] actually really more valuable than than
[42:04] Bitcoin because Bitcoin you can get more
[42:06] when you provide more value to society
[42:10] uh and and do stuff but if if your body
[42:13] is once Ru I I think you you can get
[42:16] healthy you can turn stuff also with
[42:19] sickness around and and stuff like that
[42:20] but uh there are stuff you cannot turn
[42:23] around if you damage it too long
[42:26] uh and there's this this great quote
[42:29] where like uh when when your life is
[42:32] wealth uh it's like the the first one is
[42:35] like your health and then comes all the
[42:37] zeros if you take away that one it's
[42:40] like just have zeros uh and it's uh yeah
[42:46] and it's I think a a good good thing to
[42:49] think about what what will we do with
[42:51] the life here and how can we take care
[42:54] of it it's not even like how how long
[42:56] will live like people are like oh you're
[42:59] living really healthy you take care of
[43:01] yourself you you work out you you look
[43:04] at how much you sleep and stuff like
[43:07] that it's not about going to 110 years
[43:10] old like it's not my goal but I want to
[43:13] have the best quality life right now
[43:15] also like if you eat don't train
[43:18] not working out you're your life is also
[43:22] now it's not
[43:25] just yeah you just need to think about
[43:28] um days that you have a headache you
[43:30] cannot do
[43:32] anything everything is a is a is is a
[43:36] burden now that is like a very that it's
[43:39] so it's so simple think about that you
[43:41] just have a headache you can't do
[43:42] anything so think about not having your
[43:45] health yeah you can't do like you can't
[43:48] self-actualize if you if you're
[43:51] sick or
[43:53] sick so I have a lot of
[43:56] open questions uh I think we will move
[43:59] that to some sort of round two in like
[44:02] half a year year whatever uh because com
[44:06] close to the one one hour mark and I try
[44:09] to keep it under one hour and try to be
[44:11] also respectful of of your time and
[44:14] we're having an end routine in the
[44:16] podcast where like the previous guest
[44:18] ask and it's a really interesting one
[44:20] question for the next guest uh and your
[44:24] question is and it's someone that wrote
[44:27] articles about that very topic uh uh in
[44:30] the Bitcoin magazine also uh how could
[44:34] instant lightning split payments uh
[44:37] revolutionize the the different
[44:39] Industries like it's a very did you
[44:43] interview a very technical person last
[44:46] he's he's working with a a lightning
[44:48] wallet instant lightning split payments
[44:51] something like my espresso pay espresso
[44:54] pay like what they do here now he he
[44:56] talked about the concept that uh
[44:59] everything you will do uh will be more
[45:02] about split payments uh in the industry
[45:05] it's like uh you go ahead and then you
[45:08] fill out a task and you get a split
[45:11] payment for it like it it also touches
[45:13] in value for Value in the media industry
[45:15] in podcasting like with Fountain uh but
[45:19] you also dreu that connection with
[45:22] Bitcoin and the value for Value in like
[45:24] other Industries like Construction
[45:26] Industries It's actually an interesting
[45:28] uh topic uh but it's an very specific
[45:33] topic uh and yeah it's it's interesting
[45:36] how which questions are what questions
[45:38] are coming up in those uh kind of in
[45:41] that kind of end routine if I understand
[45:43] it correctly it's like uh split payments
[45:46] means one part of the payment goes here
[45:49] and the other goes there and it's on
[45:50] lightning and it's near right yeah yeah
[45:54] there is also the like for for example
[45:57] in the fountain app uh you can have like
[46:01] uh everything that comes in you can
[46:04] split automatically with like your
[46:06] editor of the podcast like if you are
[46:08] the creator of the podcast uh and you
[46:11] can automatically set it up so that the
[46:13] money that comes in from people
[46:16] automatically get split with like I
[46:17] don't know 10% 20% with uh the editor uh
[46:22] it's also about micro payments how like
[46:24] right now the Fe World we're getting
[46:26] paid once a month but why are we not
[46:29] getting paid once a day or for each task
[46:33] directly uh when we do it because like
[46:35] we we can do a task and just get paid
[46:38] directly for the task uh when we have a
[46:41] digital instant lightning settlement
[46:44] where it there's no less cost to it it's
[46:48] it's about that whole uh topic and
[46:51] here's I think three uh um articles and
[46:56] I think he will get more out of uh more
[46:58] articles about that in the Bitcoin
[47:00] magazine uh he works at priest lightning
[47:03] wallet and uh yeah maybe maybe talk
[47:07] about the lightning the the the the
[47:11] value for value and that kind of uh R
[47:14] how do you see that I've heard about
[47:16] this before actually I didn't know the
[47:18] technical term of it but I I heard about
[47:20] the idea that you get basically you
[47:22] stream the sets to the person as they um
[47:24] provide you a service for example um and
[47:27] rather than saying I'm going to get paid
[47:29] once a month or twice a month uh you get
[47:32] paid instantly I think it's an
[47:33] interesting concept I think things are
[47:35] going to develop in a Direction that's
[47:36] the most efficient on on one hand I
[47:39] think like do I need to get paid like
[47:43] for the second that I work or can I Bund
[47:46] like is it easier for me to bundle it
[47:48] perhaps like am I that in need of
[47:52] instant um compensation on the other
[47:55] hand I think you know we can often not
[47:58] really see the value in in new payment
[48:01] Sy or new things new technologies in
[48:03] general until it becomes so integrated
[48:07] into our lives that we're like oh yeah
[48:08] how did we ever do things differently
[48:10] like how did we ever live without
[48:11] Netflix for example I mean Netflix is
[48:13] already dying again but like you know
[48:15] what I mean it's like these things they
[48:17] don't come to mind until they are there
[48:20] and then we think how did we ever live
[48:22] without them it's a very interesting
[48:23] concept because you could
[48:26] like it and it well first of all it it
[48:29] skips the middleman and that makes
[48:31] things a lot more efficient so that
[48:34] could be it could be really really
[48:37] interesting I was thinking you were
[48:38] talking about um like basically
[48:42] splitting payments well actually yeah
[48:44] talking about splitting payments to
[48:45] multiple parties I think they're doing
[48:46] something like it with a coffee Farm or
[48:50] a number of coffee Farms here in El
[48:51] Salvador I'm not too sure how exactly it
[48:53] works but I believe that they pay sort
[48:56] of royalties to the coffee Farmers for
[48:59] the coffee that is sold which is a
[49:01] really cool project and I think the app
[49:03] um is actually I met the met the guy
[49:06] yesterday um I should have asked but the
[49:08] app is called my espresso pay they um
[49:12] they split I believe it's royalties to
[49:15] Coffee farmers who produce coffee send
[49:18] it to you collection point and then they
[49:21] they process it into amazing Salvadoran
[49:25] like high grade coffee and sell it for
[49:27] Bitcoin and they try to make the whole
[49:29] process more fair to the farmers who are
[49:33] often not treated the best way and um
[49:37] and get put under under price price
[49:39] pressure and things like that so it's
[49:43] long story short I think it's I think
[49:45] it's interesting I would like to see
[49:48] more real life applications of it and um
[49:51] I think royalty is probably an
[49:53] interesting one and generally just
[49:54] making payments more efficient
[49:56] especially overseas that's the worst
[49:58] overseas payments oh my god when you
[50:00] talked earlier about how you live
[50:01] different places my yeah probably
[50:04] Austrian German mine went went they're
[50:06] like how do you do
[50:12] taxes I know a lot about a lot of
[50:14] countries tax systems
[50:17] yeah that was like that was one of my
[50:19] biggest headaches for the longest time
[50:22] and that is probably one of the big
[50:23] advantages of settling somewhere because
[50:25] you don't need to learn a new tax system
[50:28] every year because you move to a new
[50:29] country every year I have a lot of um um
[50:34] um how do you say uh I have a lot of tax
[50:37] tax returns in a lot of different
[50:39] languages which is
[50:40] funny but also not and did you all do
[50:45] this by yourself like did you had a tax
[50:47] consultant or did you just research on
[50:49] the internet about it I have a lot of
[50:51] tax
[50:54] accountants I I I am terrified of doing
[50:57] my taxes myself because I'm not an
[51:00] employee I'm I'm an entrepreneur so like
[51:03] the tax system works differently and I
[51:06] mean I'm talking personal right on the
[51:08] on the company side obviously you have
[51:09] an account and everything um but for me
[51:12] personally too like never dared do it
[51:15] myself because it's like that like you
[51:17] do it wrong you like they get angry with
[51:20] you or you overpay so like why
[51:24] bother yeah but that is like I cannot
[51:26] recommend like if you want to be a
[51:28] digital Nomad think about that like
[51:32] consider it's not sitting at the beach
[51:35] and drinking I don't know while looking
[51:39] out on the waves all the time like there
[51:41] is some if you do it properly then there
[51:44] are uh bureaucratic hurdles as well so
[51:50] uh I think that's an interesting way to
[51:53] to end the podcast definitely
[51:56] think about the Texas if
[51:59] you're like a true German yeah like a
[52:02] true German two chairmans talking to
[52:04] each other
[52:08] stopping Taxas uh thank you Lena for
[52:11] doing it and uh hope we have talk again
[52:14] yes it was a lot of fun thank you so
[52:17] [Music]
[52:20] much
