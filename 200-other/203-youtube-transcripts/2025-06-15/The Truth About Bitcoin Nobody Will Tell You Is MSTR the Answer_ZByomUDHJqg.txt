[00:00] you need Bitcoin exposure but with less
[00:02] volatility less downside risk even if it
[00:05] means muted upside risk and so micro
[00:07] strategy exists to offer those products
[00:09] to the market you could buy their
[00:10] convertible Bond the the quote unquote
[00:13] digital asset Reserve is filled with
[00:15] pre-mined coins like salana and xrp and
[00:18] cardana right a lot of the Silicon
[00:20] Valley venture capitalist firms that
[00:22] donated to Trump's campaign this time
[00:24] around a core principle of conservatism
[00:26] is that you want small limited
[00:28] government well government with money
[00:30] printer is obviously going to continue
[00:32] to get bigger and more intrusive in
[00:33] people's lives and so but with Bitcoin
[00:36] you have to be a lot more diligent at
[00:37] who you're giving Capital to so I think
[00:39] more valuable Enterprises are going to
[00:41] get funded and then Capital destructive
[00:43] businesses are not going to get that the
[00:45] worst thing is when people in your life
[00:49] that aren't bitcoiners know you're into
[00:51] Bitcoin and they try to have
[00:52] conversations with you about it and they
[00:54] don't know anything I've always thought
[00:55] Peter shiff as a secret Bitcoin holder
[01:00] [Music]
[01:02] how did you get started with with the
[01:04] conservative case for Bitcoin how did
[01:07] the idea even come in your head of like
[01:09] let's let's focus on the on the F and
[01:11] how did you get on the on the main
[01:13] message for the
[01:14] book yeah that's a great question Robin
[01:16] so it started I started writing it in
[01:20] 2023 basically I could kind of see the
[01:23] writing on the wall that Bitcoin and the
[01:26] American right wi were going to
[01:28] intersect and before I got into Bitcoin
[01:31] I was super into like Normie like
[01:33] Republican politics I voted for Trump in
[01:36] 2020 I was pretty adamant that oh we
[01:39] need to you know if we just get the
[01:41] right guy in office that'll fix
[01:42] everything I had that mentality big time
[01:44] before I got into Bitcoin so I was kind
[01:47] of familiar with a lot of the mainstream
[01:49] conservative positions especially the
[01:52] the pro-america position you know the
[01:55] founding fathers built this great
[01:56] establishment and and they had these
[01:58] fantastic ideas how can we live up to
[02:00] them and when I started to get into
[02:03] Bitcoin I realized that everything I
[02:05] believed you know through conservatism
[02:07] and and the founding principles of
[02:09] America is pretty impossible to achieve
[02:12] when you have Fiat money right like how
[02:15] can you actually drain the swamp and
[02:17] limit the size of government When
[02:18] government has the ability to print
[02:20] money so that's basically the core idea
[02:22] of my book and and thankfully you know I
[02:26] couldn't have foreseen like Trump being
[02:27] so vocally Pro Bitcoin and and obviously
[02:30] he's now like more Pro crypto but
[02:33] Bitcoin and politics have definitely
[02:35] intersected For Better or For Worse and
[02:38] I I like to use his book as a resource
[02:40] for educating people on the right wing
[02:43] they come to me they're saying hey uh
[02:45] Trump saying all this stuff about
[02:46] Bitcoin like how can I understand it and
[02:48] I feel like having a book specifically
[02:50] tailored towards that worldview is a
[02:52] great thing and and it's not that I
[02:54] think Bitcoin is only for conservatives
[02:57] there's a progressive case for Bitcoin
[02:59] there's ALS sorts of different angles
[03:01] and lenses that you can view Bitcoin
[03:03] through so and I felt like this was uh
[03:05] this was the the angle that I was well
[03:08] positioned to take and and I wanted to
[03:09] write the book so I'm really glad I did
[03:12] really cool and and for people that are
[03:15] not familiar with the book um what's
[03:17] kind of the the core feces of the the
[03:19] con conservative case for like what's
[03:21] kind of the conservative case for
[03:23] Bitcoin yeah so if you think about the
[03:25] founding values of the United States
[03:28] life liberty and property
[03:30] you don't have true property rights
[03:32] under a fiat currency right because they
[03:35] can devalue the currency by printing
[03:37] more units and effectively stealing your
[03:40] property so Bitcoin gives you property
[03:42] rights it gives you free speech because
[03:45] you can send any Bitcoin transaction
[03:47] without censorship you can attach any
[03:49] sort of message to it it restores the
[03:52] nuclear family which is a key pillar of
[03:54] conservatism right it's the idea that
[03:56] the family is more important to you than
[03:58] the state and with Fiat money and the
[04:01] rampant inflation we've seen over the
[04:03] last few decades that's forced families
[04:06] to to sort of dissipate right you have
[04:08] more more households where both parents
[04:11] are working you have higher divorce
[04:12] rates people are starting families later
[04:14] in life because the financial burden is
[04:17] just so difficult on young people in a
[04:19] in an economy with really high inflation
[04:21] like we have and so there's a numerous
[04:25] amount of factors that appeal to
[04:27] conservatives but they're they're
[04:28] pointing the finger at the wrong culprit
[04:31] when really the culprit is Fiat money
[04:33] and Bitcoin fixes a lot of these these
[04:35] issues that you know instead of turning
[04:37] to the to the state and politicians to
[04:39] fix we need to go after sort of the real
[04:42] culprit which is Fiat money and and the
[04:44] main problem there too is as government
[04:46] spending right a core principle of
[04:48] conservatism is that you want small
[04:50] limited government well government with
[04:53] a money printer is obviously going to
[04:55] continue to get bigger and more
[04:56] intrusive in people's lives and so a
[04:59] good example we're seeing of this now is
[05:01] Doge right Elon is trying to cut
[05:03] government spending you know get rid of
[05:05] all these bureaucrats all these programs
[05:07] and sure he's he's doing some of that
[05:10] but you're really when you look at the
[05:11] math you're only scratching the surface
[05:13] because the entitlement programs
[05:15] military spending interest payments on
[05:17] the debt this is the large majority of
[05:19] the budget and that that stuff's not
[05:21] getting touched and they can continue to
[05:23] finance those those destructive Capital
[05:26] programs because they have a money
[05:27] printer so if you really are honest
[05:30] about how can we limit the size of
[05:31] government step one is in the Federal
[05:34] Reserve and step two is adopt Bitcoin
[05:35] and so that's one of the key arguments I
[05:37] make in my
[05:38] book yeah and it's it's really funny
[05:40] with Doge because uh I've I've just
[05:43] watched the the podcast literally today
[05:45] with El musk and Sh Rogan that dropped I
[05:47] think like one or two days ago and um he
[05:51] might not say it and you might have a
[05:53] different VI it but I think IL musk is
[05:55] such a bitcoiner and like he talks about
[05:58] social security being p scheme literally
[06:00] on the podcast he talks about all those
[06:03] things of government spending uh and and
[06:06] how the government is is kind of the the
[06:10] the the biggest scam of like he he he
[06:13] talks about everything and I always like
[06:16] oh like why don't you why aren't you a
[06:19] public Bitcoin Maxi like why why not
[06:22] that right well I think he's Satoshi
[06:25] actually that's my running Theory and
[06:27] it's gotten hate yeah it's it's gotten
[06:30] hate on bitcoin Twitter because
[06:32] obviously a couple years ago he did the
[06:34] whole Doge thing like a Dogecoin not the
[06:36] Doge Department of government efficiency
[06:39] he he's kind of trolled Bitcoin
[06:40] maximalists so I I'll give you the the
[06:43] main points there why why I think you
[06:45] know he's I'm not 100 percent certain
[06:47] but you know he's my personal leading
[06:49] candidate one is like you said he he
[06:52] says these things he's very very
[06:54] libertarian he seems to have this kind
[06:56] of Austrian
[06:57] background and back in
[07:00] when Satoshi sent out the
[07:02] original white paper um to that to the
[07:04] cipher Punk mailing list Elon musk's
[07:07] x.com email address was on that that
[07:10] list so he was involved in this
[07:12] community I mean for crying out loud he
[07:15] worked on PayPal he was building digital
[07:17] payments prior to to bitcoin being
[07:20] released um and then there's there's
[07:22] more esoteric details so like his son
[07:26] his son's name is uh X Ash AR Angel 12
[07:30] the the x- AE whatever really weird name
[07:34] but Ash is is Satoshi in
[07:37] Japanese um let's see what else he he
[07:40] he's he has the the the plethora of
[07:43] domains that you would that Satoshi
[07:45] needed right obviously Satoshi
[07:46] understood computer science but he also
[07:49] understood monetary history he
[07:50] understood politics and and government
[07:53] all these different spheres came
[07:55] together to create Bitcoin Elon Musk he
[07:58] he's obviously well well read and well
[08:00] researched and and well studied and
[08:02] across all these different
[08:04] domains um he they they kind of speak in
[08:07] a similar dialect right when satoshi's
[08:09] emails were leaked we saw he used the
[08:11] word and he had this very like
[08:14] I don't care attitude you know if you
[08:16] don't get it I don't have time to
[08:17] explain it to you Elon musk's very very
[08:20] similar personality they both use two
[08:22] spaces after periods the the list kind
[08:24] of goes on and on it's interesting also
[08:28] the uh edit to have like oh I moved on
[08:30] to other projects I don't care like I I
[08:33] think it's it's good enough and I have
[08:35] other things and more that's that's El
[08:38] musk's whole life right with like uh he
[08:40] he builds things and they kind of live
[08:42] on its own like Tesla SpaceX all those
[08:45] things and then all of the sudden now he
[08:47] goes into government building and tries
[08:49] to figure out where payments are coming
[08:51] from and pay payments are going so it it
[08:55] would that would be hilarious right and
[08:58] then think about it this way too Satoshi
[09:01] has a million Bitcoin that he has not
[09:03] touched I'll be honest even if I was
[09:05] Satoshi I'd be touching those Bitcoins
[09:07] and and cashing in right so there's a
[09:09] good chance that Toshi is already
[09:11] extremely wealthy if he doesn't need or
[09:13] or feel the the temptation to move those
[09:15] coins and so Elon Musk of course being
[09:18] as wealthy as he is he wouldn't be
[09:20] tempted to to touch those yeah it
[09:23] wouldn't even make a real I mean it it
[09:25] does make a difference but maybe not
[09:27] that big as as like
[09:30] he can already spend everything he wants
[09:32] and he also says um like IL musk says
[09:35] multiple times already in interviews I
[09:37] heard him saying oh money is basically
[09:39] just information and just a ledger and
[09:41] I'm like yeah like yes it is like you
[09:45] you get Bitcoin I I can see it but
[09:47] you're just not public about it which
[09:48] would also make sense like if if I would
[09:52] if I would be ill musk and I would have
[09:54] actually created um Bitcoin and
[09:57] therefore I also um s Koto I I wouldn't
[10:01] be that vocal about it and then just buy
[10:03] it a little bit like he he is the only
[10:06] uh with Tesla the only S&P 500 company
[10:09] that has Bitcoin I think still today
[10:11] like they have 10,000 Bitcoin and it's
[10:12] still the only company in the S
[10:14] 500 yeah that's that's true he was an
[10:17] adopter of Bitcoin on the corporate side
[10:19] more earlier than anybody else really
[10:22] absolutely really cool um that theory I
[10:26] I didn't heard you you saying there like
[10:28] that that called me of of God that's
[10:30] it's a really cool that's a really cool
[10:33] uh story and a really cool Theory
[10:35] actually also um what is your current
[10:38] take overall on on the new
[10:39] Administration with with Trump coming in
[10:42] uh with so much um new things of like
[10:46] even like podcasters influencers going
[10:48] in the White House Press rooms like
[10:50] there's so much there's probably like 50
[10:52] things that I could point to that kind
[10:54] of new and and really interesting Al
[10:57] even with like the abstein files and the
[10:59] uh the JFK files maybe that we that we
[11:02] can see maybe down the road somewhere
[11:04] it's for me I I found a lot of it to be
[11:07] quite distracting when you look at at
[11:10] what's actually been accomplished um
[11:13] it's it's not the same Trump that ran in
[11:15] 2016 this is certainly a new a new
[11:18] regime he's backed a lot by Silicon
[11:21] Valley Elite Elites and and that's why
[11:23] it doesn't surprise me that the the
[11:26] quote unquote digital asset Reserve is
[11:28] filled with free mind coins like salana
[11:31] and xrp and cardana right a lot of the
[11:33] Silicon Valley venture capitalist firms
[11:36] that donated to trumps um campaign this
[11:39] time around they pre-mined a lot of
[11:41] those coins and and got Early Access
[11:43] right and so there's a lot of enriching
[11:45] the founders going on there's not
[11:49] immigration uh reform or or deportations
[11:52] like like he ran on that you know that
[11:54] was kind of his main platform in 2016
[11:56] but so far it's March of 2025 there's
[11:59] actually been less
[12:00] deportations uh than under the Biden
[12:02] administration at this time right and so
[12:05] this this idea that Trump's going to
[12:06] come in and he's going to be truly
[12:08] America First and he's gonna really
[12:10] stand up for the American people I think
[12:12] is pretty much a fugazy really he he's
[12:14] silic and Valley First he's GDP first
[12:17] he's stock market first and that's fine
[12:20] if you can recognize it for for what it
[12:22] is right he I I I think the main play
[12:26] I'm looking at in terms of the
[12:27] administration is what is he going to do
[12:29] for asset prices like how can I position
[12:32] my portfolio as an investor to benefit
[12:34] regardless of if I agree with some of
[12:36] his moves or not and right now we're
[12:39] seeing markets tank and I don't think
[12:41] that's going to be the case for very
[12:42] long right one of his main key
[12:44] performance indicators for himself is
[12:46] hey the stock market goes up when
[12:48] Trump's in charge you know the economy
[12:50] is booming it's roaring you know Biden
[12:52] Biden economics or whatever his his
[12:54] catchphrase was was a lot of his
[12:56] platform in this cycle right and so I
[12:58] think right now we're seeing this kind
[13:00] of stalemate in terms of tariffs you
[13:03] know are they going to happen what are
[13:05] they not and markets hate uncertainty
[13:07] and there's a lot of uncertainty right
[13:08] now but Trump has been very vocal about
[13:11] wanting to get long-term interest rates
[13:13] down and pretty esoterically wanting to
[13:15] weaken the dollar right because if you
[13:17] weaken the dollar a lot of his
[13:19] objectives fall into place right he
[13:21] wants to on Reon Shore manufactur in the
[13:23] United States well you need a weaker
[13:25] dollar so you can export to other
[13:26] countries he wants the 10year rate to go
[13:28] down if if the dollar goes down the
[13:30] tenure rate will go down he wants a a
[13:33] stimulated economy with asset prices
[13:35] increasing well if the dollar if the dxy
[13:38] is strengthening it's going to be hard
[13:39] for the stock market and for Bitcoin to
[13:41] go up and so the primary thing I'm
[13:43] looking at in terms of the
[13:44] administration is is the economic side
[13:46] of things and it's a balancing act right
[13:49] because if you have Doge cutting all
[13:52] these these government programs that's
[13:54] going to cause GDP to go down because
[13:57] for some for some reason government
[13:58] spend calculated in in the economic
[14:01] productivity even though government
[14:02] spending is destructive you have all
[14:04] these workers wasting away doing you
[14:06] know LGBT reform for South Africa or
[14:09] whatever they do in in in the government
[14:12] I don't I don't understand what's going
[14:14] on with the Doge they're cutting all
[14:15] this all this stuff but that will
[14:17] negatively impact GDP that will
[14:18] negatively impact employment and that
[14:20] could give pow the the ammunition he
[14:22] needs to cut interest rates on the short
[14:24] term so I think there's a lot of things
[14:26] to be bullish about that this
[14:28] Administration is doing
[14:29] even though you know the the first month
[14:31] and a half has been pretty uh
[14:33] underwhelming especially in terms of
[14:35] Market
[14:36] activity there's also this whole like I
[14:39] mean he had his own um meme coin uh but
[14:43] I I usually disregard that because it's
[14:46] yeah it's it's it's Trump is is used to
[14:48] selling things with his name on and he
[14:50] was probably not really involved in this
[14:52] but what what kind of shocked me is the
[14:54] the shitcoin Strategic Reserve uh where
[14:57] he puts like Solan and out of things in
[14:59] there where like okay if he says like
[15:02] Bitcoin and
[15:03] ethereum I could even live with that
[15:05] like I I I would even call that but
[15:08] putting that the other things in there
[15:09] is like that goes almost a little bit
[15:12] too far and it's very underwhelming for
[15:15] me and almost
[15:16] disappointing yeah I 100% agree it's I
[15:19] saw that I TR I've been trying to stay
[15:22] off of Twitter on the weekends just to
[15:24] disconnect and I pulled it up and I saw
[15:26] that and I I immediately closed it and
[15:28] and decide because it's so much of a
[15:31] distraction right Bitcoin is sound money
[15:34] ethereum and xrp and salana and and
[15:37] cardono these are pre-mined unethical
[15:41] tokens right they're at best their
[15:43] Technologies at worst they're outright
[15:45] scams and for Bitcoin to be associated
[15:49] with them is is totally incorrect right
[15:51] Bitcoin is hard money with nobody in
[15:54] control it's a neutral digital commodity
[15:56] and it's telling that you even saw guys
[15:59] like Brian Armstrong from coinbase and
[16:01] Peter Schiff stand up against the
[16:04] shitcoin reserve too right they you know
[16:06] Brian Armstrong makes money selling
[16:08] shitcoins that's his entire business
[16:09] model and he still recognizes Bitcoin is
[16:13] different from everything else and
[16:14] there's no point in having a strategic
[16:16] stockpile of these other things that was
[16:19] uh that do not present enough on the X
[16:22] feed of mine I saw that Peter shiff
[16:24] called Bitcoin a digital gold like yeah
[16:28] did we like no it was just like yeah
[16:31] Peter Shi called it and nobody really
[16:33] react like there was some Buzz around
[16:35] that but that's big Peter Shi calling
[16:38] bit digital gold that was his best
[16:40] Bitcoin take ever I don't know that
[16:42] he'll be able to top that he I mean he's
[16:43] totally capitulated right it is digital
[16:46] gold yeah and and and we know like
[16:48] digital the the digital version of
[16:51] Something usually has a way bigger
[16:53] Market if we're thinking of like hey
[16:56] like the digital version of Music opens
[16:58] up a way bigger Market Day in the analog
[17:01] version like we can go down the list
[17:03] that that's that that's a a small Sid
[17:06] track there but it it is best Bitcoin
[17:10] take and it's the first really uh Pro
[17:14] Bitcoin take I ever heard from him all
[17:16] the other things were like weird so it's
[17:19] interesting that he gets involved do you
[17:20] think he also holds some Bitcoin yeah
[17:24] yeah you read my mind I don't want to
[17:26] get too tangential we'll revert back to
[17:27] the main point about theb are but I I've
[17:30] always thought Peter Schiff as a secret
[17:31] Bitcoin holder I kind of really
[17:33] reinforce that the it was it was about
[17:35] two years ago him and his son Spencer
[17:38] shiff had a public spat about Bitcoin
[17:40] and Spencer Schiff he's obviously he's
[17:42] super young gen Z Pro Bitcoin Pro AI Pro
[17:46] technology and I think Peter schiff's
[17:48] whole whole stick has just been a
[17:50] marketing Ploy because I mean that's
[17:53] what he's known for he's not even really
[17:54] known as the gold guy he's known as the
[17:56] anti- Bitcoin guy and if you look at his
[17:59] business shift gold they don't
[18:01] accumulate gold they sell gold so he's
[18:03] trying to dump his Gold bags onto the
[18:05] market so he can secretly accumulate
[18:07] Bitcoin I think I think that's almost
[18:09] obvious but to to get back to the main
[18:12] point with the the Bitcoin Reserve I
[18:14] while Trump has kind of fumbled the bag
[18:16] so far at the federal level I'm still
[18:19] very optimistic at legislation at the
[18:21] state level that's one of the the things
[18:24] I love about America is you have 50
[18:27] sovereign states who can more or l
[18:29] act in their own regard it's it's a very
[18:32] decentralized Nation like Bitcoin that's
[18:34] actually another point I make in my book
[18:36] is is America is decentralized just like
[18:38] Bitcoin but on that point you have 23
[18:42] different states have introduced some
[18:43] form of legislation to to enact a
[18:45] strategic Bitcoin Reserve now not all
[18:49] Leg spr legislation is created equal
[18:51] right it could be introduced in a really
[18:53] blue Democratic State and there's just a
[18:55] slim chance that that'll pass at this
[18:57] point in time but what it is is this
[19:00] it's this slow moving of the needle
[19:02] forward right a couple years ago it
[19:05] would make no sense for any politician
[19:07] to introduce that legislation there was
[19:09] no no demand for it it would have been
[19:12] very uh out of left field it would have
[19:14] made them look honestly kind of foolish
[19:16] right you're introducing uh legislation
[19:18] to accumulate a you know magic internet
[19:21] money but now we've reached to the point
[19:23] where there's there's no career risk for
[19:24] doing that and to introduce that
[19:26] legislation there's there's a base for
[19:28] it that would get Fired Up by it and
[19:30] nobody's going to look at you like oh
[19:31] you're you're a total idiot for even
[19:33] suggesting the idea so we the overt
[19:35] window is Shifting and I think at some
[19:38] point this year one of the states will
[19:40] pass that legislation I don't think
[19:42] we'll see all 50 states this this cycle
[19:45] uh but I think over the next 10 years
[19:46] we'll we'll see all 50 states and I'm
[19:49] excited to see you know who who actually
[19:51] passes it first because right now it's
[19:52] it's been a bunch of talk but we haven't
[19:54] seen any paper signs and te's crossed
[19:57] and eyes dotted but I think think
[19:58] that'll happen this year and I think
[20:00] that's going to be this you know Parker
[20:02] Lewis talks about gradually then
[20:03] suddenly I still think we have a bit
[20:06] more of the gradually left over the next
[20:08] four years if we think this Bitcoin
[20:10] having cycle this sort of political
[20:12] election cycle I think it's going to be
[20:14] more gradually and and the market was
[20:16] expecting
[20:18] suddenly yeah like uh things tend to
[20:21] take longer time than we think it's also
[20:24] interesting because I think in the last
[20:26] few years we are working to wordss that
[20:29] the public sees the separation between
[20:32] Bitcoin and crypto better and that's
[20:36] isn't that regard maybe the shitcoin
[20:39] reserve strategic shitcoin Reserve uh
[20:42] even a step backwards where all of a
[20:45] sudden the public sees like ah like
[20:47] that's all the same like there's no
[20:49] difference between Solana and Bitcoin
[20:51] and and and in that direction kind of
[20:53] yeah I would say it's a step backwards
[20:55] but I think also over the last year
[20:58] we've made made 10 steps forward if you
[21:00] look at 2021 there was there was
[21:05] obviously a ton of obfuscation and then
[21:07] in 2022 you had Sam bakman freed going
[21:09] under and the whole FTX Saga but at that
[21:12] time there was a prevailing narrative
[21:14] that Bitcoin uh is is flawed XYZ reasons
[21:19] it can't scale it's too slow and here's
[21:21] my shitcoin it does things better faster
[21:24] that was pretty like a common narrative
[21:27] but over the last year
[21:29] the dominance of of altcoins one it's
[21:31] not there financially Bitcoin dominance
[21:33] is up from 40% in 2022 to 60% now but
[21:37] the primary thing people think about
[21:39] with crypto now is meme coins Haw Tu
[21:42] coin fcoin trumpcoin like Salon
[21:45] memecoins are the dominant crypto uh
[21:48] alternative you know non-bitcoin crypto
[21:51] thing going on right now it's not like
[21:52] in 2021 where you had you know ethereum
[21:55] claiming to be some kind of Technology
[21:57] you're seeing altcoins move further and
[21:59] further to the full-blown Casino Ponzi
[22:02] like everyone knows it's a scam we're
[22:04] not trying to pretend anymore and I
[22:06] think that's really good right because
[22:08] now they're being honest they're not
[22:09] lying and saying we're all these these
[22:11] various Technologies people have just
[22:13] fully pushed it towards the casino and
[22:15] so I think that's actually a major step
[22:18] forward because a normal person can look
[22:21] at fart coin or Hawk to a coin and know
[22:24] that's a scam obviously that's gambling
[22:26] and they can see a difference between
[22:28] that in Bitcoin so I think yeah the the
[22:31] shitcoin reserve is a step backwards but
[22:33] I do think that distinction is a lot
[22:35] more clear now than it was a couple
[22:37] years ago and the ETFs were a big help
[22:39] with that right the fact that black rock
[22:42] gave that stamp of approval for Bitcoin
[22:44] as an investable asset and a lot of
[22:46] traditional financial institutions are
[22:48] putting out research on bitcoin they're
[22:50] not putting out research on anything
[22:51] else I think that those are all great
[22:54] signs that were headed in the right
[22:55] direction in terms of really educating
[22:58] the rest of the world on the distinction
[22:59] between Bitcoin and
[23:01] crypto yeah I want to get to the ETFs in
[23:04] a second because they are kind of
[23:06] overlooked and it's the second year but
[23:08] first um one more thing on on the on the
[23:13] on the shitcoin side do you think like
[23:15] in a free market things survive if they
[23:17] have value and uh I I feel like we never
[23:21] really had a free market I don't know if
[23:23] you agree with that uh and um do you
[23:27] think shitcoins will long term I'm
[23:30] thinking like 50 100 years survive uh
[23:33] because like there's also casinos and
[23:35] and stuff like that will those as I
[23:38] don't know digital art or like
[23:40] speculative
[23:42] casinos find some kind of Market or can
[23:45] we get rid of them I agree we've never
[23:47] had a free market you can't have that
[23:49] when money and interest rates are
[23:51] centrally planned and I do think let's
[23:54] call it tokenized assets will exist in
[23:57] some capacity
[23:59] I don't think it's going to be the
[24:00] shitcoins we see today I think what what
[24:03] could happen is Apple stock could trade
[24:07] as a token where you can have self-
[24:09] custody of Apple stock and it can trade
[24:12] 247 365 globally but the question you
[24:16] have to ask yourself is how can I how
[24:20] can I position my Capital today to
[24:22] benefit from that because it's not
[24:25] buying meme coins or various random
[24:28] token
[24:29] and even then you know what's the total
[24:30] addressable market cap of tokenized
[24:33] equities it's not going to be the same
[24:35] it's not going to be anywhere close to
[24:36] what bitcoin's total addressable Market
[24:38] is Right Bitcoin has a total addressable
[24:40] Market of all the Savings in the world
[24:43] which is estimated from anywhere you
[24:45] know $400 trillion dollar to 900
[24:47] trillion doll the the best you could do
[24:49] with tokenized equities is know the SMP
[24:52] has a market cap of what 30 trillion
[24:54] you'd be hoping to capture some of that
[24:56] versus Bitcoin is going after all of
[24:58] stocks all of real estate all of gold
[25:00] all of Fine Art all of treasuries any
[25:03] way that humans have used to store value
[25:06] Bitcoin is competing with that and it
[25:08] has Superior scarcity portability
[25:10] divisibility fungibility all these
[25:12] things and so Bitcoin is going for a
[25:15] much larger pie and it's a much higher
[25:17] certainty that it will actually obtain
[25:19] some of that and so I'm not totally
[25:22] opposed the idea of tokenizing certain
[25:24] things but the the tokens you see out in
[25:26] the in the market right now they all
[25:28] underperform Bitcoin none of them have a
[25:30] real viable use case at this moment like
[25:33] what does salana do it's a platform for
[25:35] creating gambling coins that's ethereum
[25:37] is the same thing so I think I think and
[25:40] I think this is kind of sailor's Point
[25:42] why he beats around the bush and some of
[25:44] his language has been annoying right
[25:45] because he talks about digital tokens I
[25:48] don't think any of the things we see now
[25:49] are that but I I also I think it's good
[25:52] that we get that regulatory Clarity
[25:54] right I think as long as the state
[25:57] creates a Level Playing Field for all of
[25:59] this Bitcoin will win like that doesn't
[26:02] concern me so I think you know clear
[26:04] legislation Fair playing field Bitcoin
[26:06] wins in that environment absolutely
[26:08] really that that's super interesting uh
[26:11] with the free market um do the ETFs uh
[26:15] quickly um how are they kind of
[26:18] overlooked right now because I think in
[26:21] the in the in the ETF it's like the
[26:24] second year uh they really get going uh
[26:27] and they need a bit of time and also
[26:29] those products are usually uh better if
[26:32] they already have some track record um
[26:35] uh is that something that you're looking
[26:37] forward in in in 2095 the ETFs kind of
[26:40] slowly and and quietly actually just
[26:42] accumulating and and putting a lot of
[26:44] purchasing power in
[26:46] Bitcoin yes it absolutely is and it's
[26:49] among a plethora of what I I think of as
[26:54] long-term Catalyst right everyone has a
[26:57] fish bre TR especially on bitcoin
[26:59] Twitter and they're looking for one-off
[27:01] events that will cause the Bitcoin price
[27:03] to rip but the ETF it's it's a paradigm
[27:07] shift right we went from a regime where
[27:10] brokerage accounts had no way to get
[27:11] direct Bitcoin exposure to now brokerage
[27:14] accounts do have a way to get direct
[27:15] Bitcoin exposure and so over time we're
[27:18] going to continue to see the ETFs
[27:20] accumulate more Bitcoin or rather
[27:22] investors accumulate more Bitcoin but
[27:24] using the ETF as the vehicle right in
[27:28] 2024 they had $40 billion doll worth of
[27:31] inflows I don't think that pace will
[27:33] necessarily slow down in further more
[27:37] there are more of these kind of
[27:38] long-term catalysts right you've got
[27:41] micr strategy convertible bonds that's
[27:43] another vehicle for investors to get
[27:45] Bitcoin exposure you have Bitcoin
[27:47] treasury companies that's again not a
[27:50] singular one-off event with singular you
[27:53] know gasoline on the fire Catalyst but
[27:55] it's throwing some more logs into the
[27:57] fire so to speak it's it's these these
[27:59] catalysts that take a longer time to
[28:01] play out but you're opening more doors
[28:03] for Capital to go from the traditional
[28:05] Financial system to the Bitcoin
[28:07] Financial system and I think there's a
[28:10] lot of a lot of those types of catalysts
[28:12] that haven't even been created yet right
[28:14] think like bitcoin-backed mortgages or
[28:17] or you know products that are like a
[28:19] bitco Bitcoin rolled in with the
[28:20] treasury bond there's there's literally
[28:22] no sour we had uh ETFs on or sorry
[28:26] options on the ETFs get launched earlier
[28:28] this year right that opens up a whole
[28:30] another game because institutions can't
[28:32] just buy Spot Bitcoin right they need to
[28:34] hedge their exposure they need different
[28:35] types of vehicles with different risk
[28:38] reward profiles Bitcoin exposure with
[28:40] different degrees of volatility and so I
[28:43] think now that we have Sab 122 we're g
[28:45] to get more of that that those products
[28:48] built out because now Banks can offer
[28:50] Bitcoin custody products and and these
[28:52] are again the they're not going to build
[28:54] JP Morgan is not going to build a
[28:55] Bitcoin platform overnight it's going to
[28:57] take a long period of time and so I
[28:59] think we'll see more of these these
[29:00] products similar to the ETF in that they
[29:03] allow trafi to get Bitcoin exposure and
[29:05] I think they'll all continue to do well
[29:07] and just slowly but surely more capital
[29:09] is going to find its way into Bitcoin
[29:12] interesting yeah those those bridges are
[29:15] super interesting I see ETFs and and all
[29:18] those things kind of as Bridges from the
[29:20] feat world to bitcoin world uh even like
[29:24] with with uh like exchanges like Bitcoin
[29:26] only exchanges like swan relay and all
[29:28] all those things they they are basically
[29:31] just bridges that bring us from the
[29:34] field system to the Bitcoin system uh
[29:37] and it's actually I I was always of my I
[29:40] always thought that we kind of have most
[29:42] of the big uh vents open that we already
[29:46] have the the big Bridges done but the
[29:49] just like just the first people just
[29:52] getting started with with walking over
[29:54] that it's interesting that you brought
[29:56] up that that you expect way more of of
[29:59] those bridges and those things that
[30:01] building build out how much if we see a
[30:05] bridge between Fiat and Bitcoin and it's
[30:09] like it's like 100 meters wide how much
[30:12] of the bridge is already open like how
[30:14] much would you say that that that we
[30:16] already have the the products and
[30:18] services in in place um for in order to
[30:22] have I mean we don't get to full Bitcoin
[30:25] uh adoption people still have to to
[30:27] cross bridge but how much of the the the
[30:29] bridge is already open that's a really
[30:32] good question I like that framing I
[30:34] would say the ETFs were half the bridge
[30:37] they opened up that was the biggest
[30:39] thing to get direct spot Bitcoin
[30:41] exposure and I think through micro
[30:45] strategy that another 25% of the bridges
[30:48] open not through their Equity but
[30:50] through their convertible notes right
[30:52] and through their products like like
[30:54] strike their preferred stock there's
[30:56] there's those are things that instit
[30:57] tional investors with billions of
[30:59] dollars are allocating Capital into so I
[31:02] think the majority of the bridge is open
[31:05] I mean I think there's there's a few
[31:07] pools of capital that can't really get
[31:08] clean exposure right like the real
[31:10] estate market I think more Bitcoin
[31:14] backed mortgage type products or home
[31:16] equity lines to buy Bitcoin I think that
[31:18] could unlock some serious Capital
[31:20] because if you look at the average
[31:22] American half their wealth is in their
[31:24] 401k and the other half is in their home
[31:27] and so the ETF allow that 401k wealth to
[31:29] get into Bitcoin but you need some way
[31:31] to get that home equity value into
[31:32] Bitcoin so I think that's kind of the
[31:34] last whale left but like you said the
[31:37] bridge can be open but they have to
[31:38] cross it and I think we'll see the the
[31:40] crossing over the next 10 years let's
[31:42] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[31:44] the puty that coin vigilante has made
[31:47] with the Bitcoin watches those watches
[31:50] are the most amazing the most elegent
[31:53] way of showing that you are a true
[31:56] bitcoiner and coin gante just dropped a
[31:59] completely new and amazing Genesis
[32:02] edition of their watch collections you
[32:04] have the date of the first ever mined
[32:08] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[32:10] also the block height and which EPO we
[32:13] are currently in I love the level of
[32:16] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[32:19] make sure to check out those amazing
[32:21] coin viilante the time pieces down in
[32:24] the descriptions I love those watches so
[32:27] so much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[32:30] really do hope that you don't have it on
[32:32] Exchange but if you do have it on
[32:34] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[32:36] with that the first way is you put it on
[32:38] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[32:41] you to get into the self custody game I
[32:44] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[32:47] for that it's a super simple and secure
[32:50] way and if you check out the link in the
[32:53] description you even get 5% off if you
[32:55] use the code Robin and the second way is
[32:58] the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is your
[33:02] Allin partner in terms of how to get the
[33:05] most out of your sovereignty they will
[33:08] personalize for you a self- custody
[33:11] setup that is perfect for your
[33:13] individual situation they will show you
[33:16] how you can secure your own devices
[33:19] securing your Bitcoin is not enough you
[33:21] also have to keep all your devices
[33:23] secure one topic that is overlooked
[33:25] often is the inheritance plan what
[33:28] happens with your Bitcoin once you are
[33:31] no longer here do you have a plan for
[33:33] that in place already and last but not
[33:36] least if you're in jurisdictions where
[33:38] you don't feel safe it's better to get a
[33:40] plan B for all that head over to the
[33:43] Bitcoin way.com
[33:45] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[33:49] just a quick side note I will be for the
[33:52] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[33:54] Prague event in June it will be
[33:57] absolutely absolutely legendary and I'm
[33:59] really looking forward to seeing all of
[34:01] you there you can get your ticket in the
[34:04] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[34:06] brag and very important use code Robin
[34:09] to get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[34:12] looking forward seeing you there yeah it
[34:14] it takes sometimes like even if you
[34:16] think back like 10 years it was so hard
[34:18] to even buy bit Bitcoin I I had actually
[34:22] yesterday a talk with someone the bought
[34:24] Bitcoin in 2013 and he talked about how
[34:28] uh he had to meet some guy uh and he
[34:31] felt like he's doing some drug dealing
[34:34] because he was was buying Bitcoin back
[34:36] then so uh it was already very hard in
[34:40] in the in in in the in the past and now
[34:43] it's like oh like you you can uh just go
[34:46] anywhere and you buy Bitcoin like PayPal
[34:48] like there's so many places that you
[34:50] already have that you can buy
[34:52] Bitcoin right that's that's such a great
[34:54] Point we've we've come a long way and
[34:57] one more point I'll add is like this has
[34:59] to happen if you want Bitcoin to get to
[35:01] a million dollars right right now it's
[35:03] the market cap it's $2 trillion
[35:05] primarily driven by retail retail got us
[35:08] to I would say to a one trillion dollar
[35:10] market cap right in 2021 that was very
[35:13] retail driven you had the the stimulus
[35:15] checks and the whole Robin Hood GameStop
[35:18] Saga ret that was the peak retail
[35:20] investor craze and that got Bitcoin to
[35:22] a$ trillion dollar market cap but it
[35:23] wasn't until the ETFs launched that we
[35:25] got from one trillion to two trillion
[35:27] and we we're going to need these these
[35:29] Bridges to get built and to get crossed
[35:31] for Bitcoin to go from 2 trillion to 20
[35:33] trillion and that's just that's just a
[35:35] fact of of the matter right and people
[35:38] look at these traditional Financial
[35:39] products and they'll they'll rebuke them
[35:41] saying well the whole point of Bitcoin
[35:43] is to dismantle this system well sure
[35:47] but this isn't Bitcoin capitulating to
[35:50] traditional Finance this is the other
[35:51] way around right the Bitcoin Network
[35:53] operates entirely independently and the
[35:57] fact that it it it exists it can't go
[35:59] away it can't be shut down you're seeing
[36:01] the world adapt itself around Bitcoin
[36:03] Bitcoin hasn't changed the world is
[36:05] changing to to mold itself to bitcoin
[36:08] it's a good framing I like that um you
[36:10] brought brought up micro strategy um
[36:14] what what do you think will be the role
[36:15] in the future of of micro strategy uh
[36:18] they have so many if if we actually end
[36:20] up in a Bitcoin world where there is a
[36:23] maximum of like maybe I don't know 15 or
[36:25] 18 million Bitcoin a total and they
[36:27] already have half a million of that uh
[36:30] what kind of a role will they they play
[36:32] or what what what do you think will the
[36:34] the future of micr strategy be under a
[36:36] pure Bitcoin standard where Fiat doesn't
[36:39] exist I'm not sure what role they play
[36:42] but I think they play the most important
[36:44] role in this transition so if you're an
[36:47] investor you can't just buy Spot Bitcoin
[36:50] and put it on your cold card like you
[36:52] can if you're a retail investor and they
[36:55] have all they have to manage risk right
[36:57] I can stomach volatility because I'm 24
[37:00] I have no obligations I have nobody to
[37:02] to report to I don't have to sell assets
[37:04] anytime soon but if you're managing
[37:07] money on the behalf of someone else you
[37:09] you can't have 75% draw Downs in your
[37:11] portfolio right but how can you get
[37:14] Bitcoin exposure with that in mind right
[37:17] you need Bitcoin exposure but with less
[37:19] volatility less downside risk even if it
[37:22] means muted upside risk and so micro
[37:24] strategy exists to offer those products
[37:26] to the market you could buy their
[37:28] convertible Bond and you have 0% nominal
[37:32] risk because they have to pay back the
[37:34] the principle on that but you get the
[37:37] option to convert to micro strategy
[37:39] equity which is convert which is
[37:41] correlated to bitcoin right so you have
[37:43] upside Bitcoin exposure with less
[37:45] downside risk and they're the fact that
[37:48] they have what is it 500,000 Bitcoin on
[37:51] their balance sheet they have the most
[37:53] options volume in the entire Market very
[37:55] liquid high volume stock they're the
[37:58] most well positioned to offer this
[38:00] product to the the whales of the world
[38:02] to large institutional investors so I
[38:04] think they're they're going to offer and
[38:06] this is pretty much what they do and I
[38:08] think their business is gonna g to
[38:09] continue to grow they offer a suite of
[38:12] financial products that can give an
[38:14] investor Bitcoin exposure but with
[38:16] different degrees of upside different
[38:17] degrees of volatility and risk and I
[38:19] think they're they're very well
[38:21] positioned in the market and I'm
[38:23] incredibly bullish on them and if you're
[38:26] you know Bitcoin Max Maxim like myself
[38:28] and and you crave Bitcoin exposure your
[38:30] if your hurdle rate is Bitcoin it's a
[38:32] good Equity to own for that reason
[38:34] because they use BTC yield as a kpi
[38:37] their goal is for the equity to
[38:39] outperform bitcoin over the long run
[38:42] accumulate more Bitcoin per outstanding
[38:44] share and we've seen copycats so to
[38:47] speak of this play but I think you know
[38:50] like Bitcoin there's no second best I
[38:52] think to some extent that's true within
[38:55] the world of Bitcoin equities because
[38:57] it's the most volume because it's the
[38:58] most liquid I think it can attract the
[39:01] most demand for their convertible notes
[39:04] with the exception being you know metap
[39:06] planet is in Japan so that's an entirely
[39:08] different Market Japanese investors
[39:10] can't buy us equities so I think there's
[39:12] kind of room for one of these Bitcoin
[39:14] treasury company goliaths with within
[39:17] each market and the us being the largest
[39:20] Capital Market in the world micro
[39:21] strategy plays a very important role
[39:24] being that that entity that allows a lot
[39:26] of that Capital to get into
[39:28] Bitcoin that's super interesting Al the
[39:30] Bitcoin yield uh is something I'm I'm
[39:33] really looking at because on a personal
[39:36] not on a personal note I stopped uh
[39:39] measuring my net worth in dollars or
[39:42] Euros or any Fiat currencies because
[39:44] it's just volatile and you and you feel
[39:47] really smart if Bitcoin goes up 2X and
[39:49] you feel really dumb if Bitcoin crashes
[39:51] down 40% but the reality is you you
[39:55] haven't you're not too smarter just
[39:57] because Bitcoin goes up 2X and you are
[39:59] not dumo just because Bitcoin crashes
[40:01] down so I like the idea of a Bitcoin
[40:04] yield of H how many more Bitcoin how
[40:07] many more Sates did you um accumulate
[40:11] this year um versus last year uh and
[40:15] this kind of framing of what I'm using
[40:19] personally uh and now also like with
[40:22] Bitcoin yield and and and how many more
[40:24] Bitcoin Could you actually accumulate on
[40:27] um
[40:27] uh company side is super interesting do
[40:30] you think that will be maybe some
[40:33] someday as like an an earnings per share
[40:36] is right now of like okay how many
[40:38] Bitcoin Could you actually accumulate or
[40:40] over the one year and this is kind of a
[40:43] a key metric for for companies going
[40:46] forward yes definitely and it may take a
[40:50] little while longer before that's a
[40:52] mainstream kpi but if you're already
[40:55] Bitcoin native if you're a hardcore
[40:58] Bitcoin or it's your unit of account
[40:59] that's the only kpi that matters for you
[41:02] it when it comes to allocating Capital
[41:04] just directly to bitcoin or buying
[41:06] equity in one of these these Bitcoin
[41:07] treasury companies there's I we're we're
[41:10] close to a 100 companies now that have
[41:12] put Bitcoin on their balance sheet but
[41:15] most of them aren't using this as a kpi
[41:17] right they just bought a little bit of
[41:18] Bitcoin with their cash position those
[41:20] stocks they're not going to outperform
[41:22] bitcoin at least not over any kind of
[41:24] longer period of time the only ones that
[41:27] have any hope of doing it are the ones
[41:29] that use Bitcoin yield as a kpi because
[41:31] they're objectively making
[41:33] outperformance of Bitcoin their goal and
[41:35] so yeah I I think that's the most
[41:37] important metric to look at right now
[41:39] and over the next 10 years we'll see a
[41:41] lot more companies adopt that as a kpi I
[41:44] do think it needs a new name though
[41:46] because Bitcoin yield is very deceiving
[41:48] it it it makes me think of like blockfi
[41:50] yield products and I know that's not
[41:52] what it measures but yeah that it I
[41:54] think it could use a Rebrand so to speak
[41:57] yeah when I first heard it I was like ah
[42:00] Bitcoin yield that's that that's
[42:02] something sketchy but then I was like
[42:05] wait Michael S is talking about it I
[42:07] should I should look into it and like
[42:09] yeah that that has nothing to do with
[42:11] any yield for for me yeah yeah it's I
[42:14] don't he he should have came up with a
[42:16] better name I also don't understand the
[42:18] strategy Rebrand maybe he's he's got a
[42:21] longer term Vision I I thought micro
[42:23] strategy was like a very you know
[42:24] household name it's like changing
[42:26] Twitter to X I think it's kind of on in
[42:29] the same boat I don't know if you have
[42:30] any thoughts on the the Rebrand of
[42:32] strategy maybe it's something that comes
[42:35] down the line um also with the strategy
[42:37] B uh of like he has different branches
[42:40] of the company of strategy and then he
[42:43] puts uh I don't know strategy Bank uh
[42:46] like the there's like a retail bank for
[42:48] for Bitcoin Holdings where you can maybe
[42:50] even makes products around like Bitcoin
[42:53] backed loans and stuff like that so I
[42:56] could imagine a lot but that's just pure
[42:58] speculation on on on my side um I do
[43:03] think uh um besides the name I think
[43:07] they're doing a great job of um just
[43:09] positioning themselves more and more as
[43:11] a Bitcoin company also from branding
[43:14] with like the orange and with the beina
[43:16] and the symbol they could have done the
[43:18] same thing with keeping the micro in
[43:19] front of strategy um I don't know why
[43:23] they did that but uh they probably had a
[43:25] good reason reason for for doing that
[43:27] and maybe we don't know the reason yet
[43:29] like maybe there's there's more coming
[43:32] down the line but I do think it's it's
[43:34] very um good for them that they have the
[43:37] orange and the the B now in there from
[43:39] Bitcoin so uh it's it's for even for uh
[43:44] people that don't know anything about
[43:46] strategy a micro strategy um this they
[43:50] can see it from the beginning I was like
[43:51] oh they have something to do with
[43:53] Bitcoin yeah yeah yeah no I think I
[43:56] think you're right and if there's
[43:57] anything I've learned it's don't fade
[43:59] Michael sailor that man is a lot smarter
[44:01] than I am so I trust he's got a he's got
[44:03] a plan there with that yeah and he he he
[44:06] tends to think things through to the end
[44:09] like yeah it's funny he had strategy.com
[44:12] the domain already too he that dude's
[44:14] been squatting on some good domains for
[44:16] two and a half decades now yeah I mean
[44:19] hope that I I do love the fact that if
[44:22] you type in hope.com it you come to
[44:24] bitcoin even though I got it once as a
[44:29] negative Point uh I I I do like the
[44:32] hope.com S just like to send it to
[44:34] people uh and they send it once to like
[44:37] a cousin of mine I'm like and he's like
[44:39] hope.com gets to bitcoin that seems very
[44:42] sketchy because they uh had the Hope
[44:46] connected to like religion and stuff
[44:48] like that I'm like no hope is a good
[44:50] thing like you want to have like you
[44:52] want to have if you connect hope. like
[44:55] there's something else wrong
[44:57] right it's I'm glad you kind of brought
[45:00] that up because I was actually was doing
[45:01] a Bible study recently and the word hope
[45:04] comes up a lot in the Bible but I think
[45:06] that the English language is so flawed
[45:08] hope when you when you initially hear it
[45:11] you think to be hopeful about something
[45:13] means almost wishful thinking but the
[45:16] the original like Greek and Hebrew word
[45:18] of Hope is like a confident expectation
[45:22] so to to hope that Bitcoin is going to
[45:24] go up it's not wishful thinking it's not
[45:27] you know fingers crossed maybe this will
[45:29] happen no I hope Bitcoin goes up because
[45:32] I'm really confident and I want to
[45:33] express that confidence I I think it's a
[45:35] Surefire thing because I know 21 million
[45:37] is a Surefire thing Fiat to basement is
[45:39] a Surefire thing so therefore I'm quite
[45:42] hopeful that bitcoin's exchange rate and
[45:44] purchasing power will go up and it's not
[45:46] wishful thinking it's it's confidence
[45:47] and I look forward to the day when
[45:49] Bitcoin you know hits a million dollars
[45:51] 10 million 100 million yeah it's the I I
[45:54] wish uh I I hope for Bitcoin to go there
[45:57] it's almost like I wish for Bitcoin to
[46:00] go there it's it's like weird in the
[46:01] English language I I do agree with that
[46:04] um let's go uh before we get to the end
[46:06] of the podcast I want to have one more
[46:08] thing with the impact that Bitcoin will
[46:11] have um the one thing that I'm super
[46:15] interested in like overall the Bitcoin
[46:17] impact on on the world but um more
[46:19] importantly with you I think it would be
[46:22] interesting to talk about taxes and you
[46:25] brought it up in the beginning the
[46:26] nuclear family
[46:27] uh and the impact that Fiat had on it
[46:29] and the impact that reversed will will
[46:32] Bitcoin have on that maybe let's start
[46:34] with with the family aspect of it what
[46:36] do you think had feared for an impact on
[46:40] on the family and what impact will then
[46:43] reverse Bitcoin have yeah so Fiat was
[46:47] the hammer and nail that destroyed the
[46:50] nuclear family in America and if you go
[46:52] to WTF happened in 1971. comom you can
[46:55] see all the charts showing the
[46:57] separation higher divorce rates people
[46:59] having children later in life people
[47:01] having fewer children less uh you know
[47:05] households where just the Dad is working
[47:07] and the mother's able to stay home and
[47:08] raise the children and now by by proxy
[47:12] of that the kids have to be raised by
[47:13] the state right a lot of this has been
[47:16] you know the fingers pointed at a bunch
[47:17] of different things but Fiat money is
[47:19] the culprit ultimately and I'm 24 years
[47:23] old at my age 50 100 years ago it would
[47:28] almost be expected that I'm getting
[47:30] ready to start a family right by 24 you
[47:32] know mid 20s you should be getting
[47:34] married having kids and and that's one
[47:36] of the most important things to do in
[47:37] life right is to raise other humans to
[47:40] be you know good contributing members of
[47:43] society but now people are having fewer
[47:45] kids they're getting divorced there's
[47:47] all this this entanglement at the family
[47:49] level and people are like nobody my age
[47:53] hardly is starting a family the only
[47:54] people I like I'm engaged I got engaged
[47:57] recently I'm ready to do that but if I
[47:59] didn't have Bitcoin I wouldn't feel
[48:01] comfortable enough financially to be
[48:02] able to do that right Bitcoin gives me a
[48:05] peace of mind and security that in the
[48:07] future like I'm GNA have that taken care
[48:09] of but other people my age that aren't
[48:11] on a Bitcoin standard they don't save in
[48:13] Bitcoin not a single one of them is
[48:16] married or even close to getting married
[48:18] and having children they're they're
[48:19] waiting until they're in their 30s right
[48:22] and Bitcoin totally flips that on its
[48:25] head I know a bunch of of other
[48:27] bitcoiners my age they're married they
[48:29] have kids and it just gives you that
[48:31] peace of mind and and that security and
[48:33] that's one of the most important things
[48:34] as a family is is to be able to provide
[48:36] financially and Bitcoin really enables
[48:39] that because he used to be able to just
[48:41] work an average job right my my
[48:43] grandfather worked a normal job in Rural
[48:47] America he supported four children sent
[48:49] them all to college bought a house
[48:51] bought two cars supported my grandmother
[48:53] normal incomes don't allow for that
[48:55] anymore if you have a norm income you
[48:57] probably have two roommates and you can
[48:59] barely afford to pay your bills let
[49:01] alone raise children right and so your
[49:04] your options are to save in Bitcoin or
[49:06] to be a really high performing
[49:08] entrepreneur start your own business you
[49:10] know be a doctor or a lawyer have have a
[49:13] really high paying skill and so not
[49:14] everyone's suited to have a high paying
[49:16] skill but everybody is suited to saving
[49:18] Bitcoin it doesn't matter if you're a
[49:20] plumber or if you're a doctor or if
[49:23] you're an accountant or if you're a
[49:25] Bitcoin podcaster we can all save in
[49:28] Bitcoin and it's almost uh the way I
[49:31] describe it to my friends is like Dave
[49:34] Ramsey has write about 90% of stuff when
[49:36] it comes to personal finance it's really
[49:38] simple uh spend less than you make but
[49:42] the 10% he's missing is you have to save
[49:43] that in Bitcoin you can't save that in
[49:45] index funds you can't save it in cash
[49:47] you can't save it in in a basket of
[49:49] stocks right you have to save that in
[49:50] Bitcoin because it's the only thing that
[49:53] can reliably outpace Fiat inflation
[49:57] absolutely and and I just want to bring
[49:59] up uh the the side you mentioned uh with
[50:03] with uh what the happened in in in
[50:07] in 1971 basically um because I I just
[50:11] realized and never showed that side on
[50:13] the podcast which is a strategy I think
[50:16] that I did never did that uh but there's
[50:19] all the charts and I had a I think an
[50:23] evening where I just like took like one
[50:25] two hours of like really looking at
[50:27] those charts and one two hours is not
[50:29] enough because there are many many
[50:32] charts and you really have to dive dive
[50:35] into them uh to actually understand them
[50:38] and it's just a a good thing to do if
[50:40] you if someone listening and never uh
[50:43] went to that side I think it's a it's a
[50:45] great side to to look at what what are
[50:48] the the charts there and what kind of
[50:50] impact Fiat money has on us like here I
[50:54] think this probably the most known of
[50:56] like productivity and compensation stuff
[50:58] like that uh but there are many more
[51:01] that go way deeper than that and that's
[51:04] it's a side that you that every every
[51:06] Bitcoin I should at least wi it once I
[51:08] feel like yeah 100% it's it's one of my
[51:11] go-to resources when people ask me about
[51:13] Bitcoin I hate the word orange pill it's
[51:15] so cringe but when you're orange pilling
[51:17] someone it's a great thing to show them
[51:19] and for those that don't know what
[51:20] happened in 1971 is the United States
[51:24] officially severed from the gold
[51:26] standard so Nixon uh declared that the
[51:28] United States dollar is no longer
[51:30] redeemable for gold and so we went to a
[51:32] pure Fiat standard in
[51:34] 1971 oh that that's it it's so normal
[51:38] for me already that I forget like I also
[51:40] was not aware of that at all before
[51:42] Bitcoin and now I talk so much about it
[51:44] that I forget that um actually I think
[51:47] like my first one two years in Bitcoin I
[51:49] was completely unaware of that uh you
[51:51] need some orange like you need go down
[51:53] the rabbit hole that it's normal for you
[51:55] so thank you so much for yeah for doing
[51:58] that that was really good yeah thanks uh
[52:01] I i' I found that with a lot of Bitcoin
[52:03] stuff there's there's certain lingo or
[52:05] references we make and they're so
[52:07] intuitive to us but for the normal
[52:10] person like we're so far deep down the
[52:12] rabbit hole we we really have to be
[52:13] careful to unwind and start from the
[52:15] basics I was talking to a guy over the
[52:18] weekend he was asking me about Bitcoin
[52:20] and I I used the phrase onchain and he
[52:22] didn't know what that meant I had to you
[52:23] know totally unwind like oh so like that
[52:26] on one chain just means it happens on
[52:28] the blockchain so there's a lot of
[52:29] things like that with Bitcoin and I
[52:31] think the sign of a good educator or
[52:33] someone who really understands a subject
[52:35] is to be able to explain it to a
[52:37] five-year-old really simple base level
[52:40] yeah like the the you have to be aware
[52:43] of of of what your um like like like
[52:47] what the other person understands and
[52:49] and and and how you can translate that
[52:51] in in understandable I do agree with
[52:53] that a lot really cool um on the second
[52:56] thing of the impact of of Bitcoin on on
[52:58] the actual World um how do you think
[53:01] taxes and the government will um
[53:04] developed in a in in a Bitcoin world I
[53:07] think there's a few different ways to
[53:09] look at this first if if we're on a true
[53:12] Bitcoin world and they can't increase
[53:14] the money supply then they're going to
[53:16] have to cut spending right because right
[53:19] now governments are able to spend more
[53:22] money than they bring in through taxes
[53:24] because they can make up the Sur plus
[53:26] with effective money printing with the
[53:28] deficit rather so one thing is that'll
[53:31] go away the second is the game theory
[53:34] really changes in a way that's favorable
[53:37] towards citizens towards being taxed
[53:39] less and the way this works practically
[53:43] is if you're a country and you want to
[53:46] attract Capital you want to attract the
[53:48] smartest people the most money the most
[53:50] well-positioned entrepreneurs in the
[53:52] world if you have a really high tax rate
[53:55] that's going to be very
[53:57] ineffective but the problem is it's hard
[53:59] for Capital to get out of countries on a
[54:02] Fiat standard because most of your
[54:04] wealth is tied into real estate that's
[54:06] immovable obviously or it's tied into
[54:08] businesses that exist in a different
[54:10] country and so this game theory can't
[54:12] really happen at scale but with Bitcoin
[54:15] you could store your wealth in your
[54:16] brain 12 words in your head you can
[54:18] cross borders with zero friction and so
[54:21] that will enable Capital to actually go
[54:23] to the places it's treated best see this
[54:27] uh already within the United States
[54:30] because you have 50 states with
[54:31] different tax laws and capital has gone
[54:33] to Florida it's gone to Texas it's gone
[54:36] to Tennessee it's gone to places where
[54:37] it's treated well and so I think on a
[54:39] Bitcoin standard this idea just gets
[54:41] taken to the absolute extreme because
[54:44] there's no way to physically stop people
[54:46] from bringing their wealth with them
[54:47] when they travel it's a good point of of
[54:49] like that and you said before that we
[54:52] never experienced the free market do you
[54:54] think that Bitcoin will bring that free
[54:56] market with like then the the money the
[55:00] money itself cannot be controlled
[55:02] anymore yeah and I think it already has
[55:04] for those that choose to step into the
[55:07] Bitcoin world and adopt Bitcoin as a
[55:09] unit of account for example if you're a
[55:13] venture capitalist firm and you're
[55:14] totally orange pilled bitcoin's your
[55:16] unitive account you're not going to be
[55:18] haphazardly shotgunning money at all
[55:21] these startups that may or may not
[55:23] succeed right that was kind of the the
[55:25] play for Angel Investors throughout the
[55:27] 2010s during zero interest rate policy
[55:30] was just you know spray and prey some of
[55:31] these startups will hit a THX and I'll
[55:33] make all this money but with Bitcoin you
[55:36] have to be a lot more diligent at who
[55:37] you're giving Capital to so I think more
[55:40] valuable Enterprises are going to get
[55:41] funded and then Capital destructive
[55:43] businesses are not going to get that and
[55:46] then another area we see this is Bitcoin
[55:48] mining actually I describe Bitcoin
[55:50] mining is the freest Market freest
[55:53] competition industry in the world
[55:55] because anybody can participate whether
[55:58] you're small or large if you have a
[56:01] source of stranded power you can plug in
[56:03] and compete directly and furthermore the
[56:07] network automatically adjusts based on
[56:09] how many miners are competing so when
[56:11] more miners plug in difficulty increases
[56:14] and the Bitcoin reward gets divided up
[56:16] amongst more more people into smaller
[56:18] chunks and so there's there's no one to
[56:21] bail you out if you're a minor right if
[56:23] you run inefficient Hardware at a high
[56:25] electricity rate you're going to become
[56:27] unprofitable when the Bitcoin price dips
[56:29] and inversely if you're a good minor you
[56:32] have efficient machines and you have
[56:34] lowcost power when your competition
[56:38] capitulates difficulty adjusts down and
[56:40] so you actually benefit for being the
[56:42] most most competitive and so I think
[56:44] just looking at Bitcoin mining
[56:46] difficulty the difficulty adjustments
[56:48] the entire industry as a whole you see
[56:50] how ruthless a true free market is right
[56:53] there's no bailouts there's it's it's
[56:55] pure competition and winners uh are
[56:58] really able to benefit the the best
[57:00] capital allocators win and there's no
[57:02] government to print money and bail you
[57:03] out that's a that's a good thing and and
[57:06] I think that's that that's that's a
[57:08] future way we want to to have and that
[57:11] that's where we really really want to
[57:12] get there at least me um really cool I
[57:15] enjoyed the episode already a lot um we
[57:18] have I have one question to ask each and
[57:20] every one of my guests and the question
[57:21] is what can we learn from you besides
[57:24] Bitcoin I would say you can learn from
[57:26] me about the Gospel of Jesus Christ so
[57:29] I'm a I'm a Christian before I'm a
[57:31] bitcoiner it's something that's that's
[57:33] super important to me I think Bitcoin is
[57:35] great because it's a tool for this Earth
[57:37] and it can make your Earthly life better
[57:38] but we are all on a ticking timer right
[57:41] we will all be uh we will all be
[57:43] deceased one day and I think there's
[57:44] something far more important in this
[57:46] life and so if you follow me on Twitter
[57:47] I I tweet about that a lot so definitely
[57:49] uh you know first I'd say read the Bible
[57:52] but if you're not going to read the
[57:53] Bible you can follow my my Twitter feed
[57:54] and I I'll share some of that with you
[57:57] for the people that that don't want to
[57:59] read the Bible they can follow you I
[58:01] love that yeah I'll give you the
[58:04] highlights you uh did you put that in
[58:06] the bio of of Twitter like if you don't
[58:08] read the Bible just follow me that's a
[58:10] that's a good idea though I should do
[58:12] that like I think that would it's like a
[58:15] oneliner that portrays your uh values
[58:19] and definitely is also really I I think
[58:21] that would be could be a good one um
[58:24] yeah thank God for Bitcoin right that
[58:26] that's
[58:28] absolutely it's it's a more biblical uh
[58:31] god-honoring monetary system right
[58:32] because one of the Ten Commandments is
[58:34] Thou shalt not send or steal sorry Thou
[58:37] shalt not steal and so inflation is
[58:39] theft inherently and Bitcoin doesn't
[58:41] steal from you it's a monetary system
[58:43] that actually honors your your rights
[58:45] and it doesn't take from you very true
[58:48] very true we have an ENT in the podcast
[58:51] where the previous guest is asking a
[58:52] question for the next guest without
[58:54] knowing who the next guest actually is
[58:57] uh the previous guest asked you the
[58:58] question what's the worst thing about
[59:01] Bitcoin the worst thing is when people
[59:05] in your life that aren't bitcoiners know
[59:07] you're into Bitcoin and they try to have
[59:09] conversations with you about it and they
[59:11] don't know anything it's it's tiresome
[59:13] especially because I work in the
[59:14] industry so five days a week I'm
[59:16] thinking about Bitcoin all day long and
[59:19] so on the weekends I actually kind of
[59:21] want to turn my brain off and i' I'd be
[59:23] totally chilled to you know talk Normie
[59:25] like how it catch the game last night
[59:27] just like bro out but then you know you
[59:29] get people bitcoin price goes up or down
[59:31] they're texting you asking you all these
[59:32] questions you meet someone new they're
[59:34] like oh this is Mitchell he's into
[59:35] Bitcoin like that part gets kind of old
[59:37] so um yeah I would say having to talk to
[59:40] people that aren't into Bitcoin about
[59:41] Bitcoin is the worst part about being a
[59:44] bitcoiner yeah especially those it it
[59:47] gets like repetitive and you TR like
[59:49] that you you try to explain the same
[59:51] thing over and over again to different
[59:53] people and yeah I get that a lot it's
[59:56] also interesting I I just recently
[59:58] stopped um recording on weekends I in
[60:01] the beginning so like actually up until
[60:04] recently uh the last like 400 recordings
[60:07] I did like Monday to Sunday and then I
[60:09] stopped on Sunday uh and I stopped on on
[60:13] Saturday also now and and it's really
[60:15] great to like get some power back so I
[60:18] think but just a side note there I think
[60:21] that's that's great to to to have some
[60:23] some time to to power back up um to
[60:26] elaborate on that it's like what's the
[60:28] point of all this right what is the
[60:29] point of saving and Bitcoin focusing on
[60:31] this what's the point of money in
[60:33] general is to get your time back right
[60:35] you can always get more Bitcoin but you
[60:37] can't get more time and so you know it
[60:39] it says in the Bible the love of money
[60:41] is the root of all kinds of evil and so
[60:43] Bitcoin is money you can't you can't
[60:45] love Bitcoin more than yourself so if
[60:47] you find yourself you know you're around
[60:49] your family you're trying to have
[60:51] quality time and you can't stop
[60:52] scrolling Bitcoin Twitter checking the
[60:53] Bitcoin price I think you should really
[60:55] re-evaluate re-evaluate your priorities
[60:57] because we we're all here to get more
[60:59] money yes to get wealthier but the
[61:02] benefit of getting wealthier is that you
[61:04] can spend more time doing things you
[61:05] love and enjoy so you know don't don't
[61:08] become hyper obsessed with Bitcoin don't
[61:09] make it your idol you know go out and
[61:11] live your life and and use it as a a
[61:13] great tool to store your value
[61:15] absolutely 100% agreed uh thank you so
