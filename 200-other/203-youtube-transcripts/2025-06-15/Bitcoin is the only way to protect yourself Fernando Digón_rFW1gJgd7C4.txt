[00:00] they saw if we do the things bad we can
[00:03] fix it by printing money they start VI
[00:05] violating the rules the laws of the
[00:08] universe one of the things that brings
[00:10] Bitcoin to the people is freedom nobody
[00:13] is going to take it from you it's a
[00:16] totally nonsense argument the only way
[00:19] people have to protect is through
[00:22] Bitcoin that's the only way we need to
[00:23] reset the system we need to come back to
[00:25] have a reference we cannot print money
[00:27] as
[00:28] crazy today is a little bit different
[00:31] because usually I do the question but
[00:33] now I will be the the guest so I'm very
[00:36] happy to be here and and talk about
[00:38] Bitcoin and especially with someone from
[00:40] Austria I'm a big fan of Austrian School
[00:43] of economics and uh yeah so thanks for
[00:47] having me cool cool yeah Austrian
[00:50] economics is interesting because I
[00:52] studied uh in Austria and I also started
[00:54] for short time economics in Austria and
[00:58] uh when I started learning about Bitcoin
[01:02] uh I was like oh why is everybody
[01:05] talking about Austrian economics like I
[01:07] was like nothing special about Austria
[01:11] in the economics side and and then I was
[01:13] discovering oh it's something completely
[01:15] different than not the Austrian
[01:16] economics right now but the Austrian
[01:18] School of economics how it was um and
[01:22] you started also economics I think right
[01:25] yes I I have a bachelor degree in
[01:27] economics and but by that time when I
[01:29] studed
[01:30] I am B I'm based in Hong Kong but I am
[01:33] from Argentina and when I studied
[01:35] economics and like 20 years ago Austrian
[01:39] economics was a bad word so usually in
[01:43] Argentina you
[01:45] have two types of universities you have
[01:48] the UN the public university that they
[01:50] teach Marxist three types Public
[01:54] University they are 100% Marxist
[01:57] communist and a little bit kesian
[02:00] the the bad the B the Black Ships are
[02:02] kesian then the main universities they
[02:06] teach kesian economics and the other
[02:09] they teach more Chicago oriented
[02:12] economics that is like the most proom
[02:15] Market way but when you talk about
[02:18] Austrian School of Economics it's about
[02:19] work when I was studying I used to find
[02:23] some publications of Australian school
[02:26] of Economic and was like some kind of
[02:28] marginal stuff but I was like fascinated
[02:31] with these theories I was fascinated
[02:33] with these authors and um and I talk
[02:36] with my teachers with my professors and
[02:39] uh they said oh this is crazy this is
[02:42] not good this is good in theory but it's
[02:45] not possible to put in practice so by
[02:48] that time Bitcoin doesn't exist the main
[02:51] thing that would make would make will
[02:53] make austan
[02:55] economic like prove that this this the
[02:57] correct way and you you you studied uh
[03:01] different kind of uh economics how did
[03:03] you shift your thinking to Austrian
[03:05] economics like how did you discover
[03:07] Austrian economics yeah basically
[03:09] because uh previous to economics I
[03:12] studied engineering I'm I'm a I'm a big
[03:14] fan of science I'm a big fan of
[03:17] mathematics physics so I started
[03:19] engineering for around four years um in
[03:24] this the university that I studied
[03:26] engineering first of all you study math
[03:29] you study Physics you study chemistry a
[03:32] lot of basic science and then you study
[03:35] the specific area of engineering that
[03:39] you uh choose at that time when I start
[03:42] the the the specific engineering I
[03:44] didn't like so I switched to economics
[03:46] but I've been always I'm still I'm a big
[03:49] fan of mathematics physics and
[03:52] everything and and I think that
[03:56] economics doesn't the traditional
[03:59] economics they teach that oh there is
[04:03] not a science it doesn't align with
[04:05] reality but everything in life needs to
[04:08] align with reality and reality is you
[04:12] need to think about the principle of
[04:15] thermodynamics that nothing is Created
[04:19] from thin air all the energy like it's
[04:23] part of transformation and it's all like
[04:26] let's say the Su the Su is zero like you
[04:29] can not create you also you you just
[04:32] transform and at that time uh in
[04:35] economics I start reading some authors
[04:37] from a school of economics and is the
[04:40] only School of Economics that um
[04:43] respects the physics of the universe and
[04:47] and the physics the law of physics so is
[04:50] the only economic that is connected with
[04:53] reality but for this um this school of
[04:58] economics you need to do the things
[05:00] correctly if you do the things bad you
[05:04] go broke if you do the things good you
[05:08] succeed and I think that the politicians
[05:12] and the main uh bankers and the main um
[05:17] actors in the economic World they
[05:19] discovered with the after in the 70s
[05:22] when they left the the the gold standard
[05:26] they saw that they can okay even though
[05:29] if we do the things bad we can fix it by
[05:33] printing money so they start VI
[05:35] violating the rules the laws of the
[05:38] universe that the only School of
[05:40] economic that respects is the o school
[05:43] of Economics so at that time there was
[05:46] no connection because was like too
[05:49] theoretical but when Bitcoin came you
[05:52] find the way to match economy with
[05:56] physics in the real world yeah like the
[06:00] comparison between the physicality and
[06:04] the real engineering style of Bitcoin
[06:07] also with uh the economics side as I
[06:10] think a sailor actually introduced me to
[06:12] that like he always talked about it like
[06:14] would you go on a wooden uh ship or on a
[06:17] on a good ship that's actually made of
[06:19] good material and will not sync if you
[06:21] you go on there like it's a it's an
[06:23] amazing journey about Bitcoin like it
[06:27] changes uh um how people are incentive
[06:30] with low time preference High Time
[06:32] preference like it's like when you
[06:35] up in Bitcoin you lose your stack you
[06:38] yeah it's like uh you you lose your keys
[06:41] it's not there anymore like it's full
[06:43] responsibility you are the master of of
[06:45] your Bitcoin um do you think that like
[06:49] key management and self- custody is
[06:51] something that everybody will do or like
[06:54] is this just something for the outliers
[06:58] and will everybody use the the
[07:00] custodians on top of
[07:02] it well I think that this is something
[07:05] like it's mandatory and and one of the
[07:09] things that brings Bitcoin to to the
[07:11] people is freedom is the freedom that
[07:14] you have your own uh
[07:17] wealth in yourself nobody is going to
[07:21] take it from you you nobody can take out
[07:24] from you like I'm from Argentina and
[07:27] during the lot of time the banks you put
[07:31] the money in the banks and and the banks
[07:33] steal the money every like 20 years the
[07:36] banks do something and they take out the
[07:38] the savings from the people either if
[07:41] you have the the the cash and you put in
[07:44] the in the in a cash like in a safe box
[07:48] you can get roll because there is a lot
[07:51] of criminality in Argentina so with
[07:54] Bitcoin you have you have this freedom
[07:56] of that you can have your wealth and you
[07:59] can can carry your wealth around the
[08:00] world but all the freedom comes with
[08:04] responsibility so uh if you want to have
[08:07] freedom you also need to be responsible
[08:11] of your own wealth and I think that the
[08:15] self- custody the saving your keys is
[08:20] mandatory and and people start
[08:23] understanding and you start
[08:24] understanding it in the in the hard way
[08:28] because
[08:30] then when you start thinking every
[08:33] everyone who who comes to bitcoin is
[08:35] like okay this is a new PayPal this is a
[08:38] new way to invest money or this is an
[08:41] alternative to Gold this is another way
[08:44] so then you start like okay buying some
[08:47] then you you try to trade or you try to
[08:50] put in your let's say what happened in
[08:52] the in the exchanges and and then you
[08:55] probably lose the money and and then you
[08:58] realize oh
[09:00] it's not like this or for people who
[09:02] lose the keys people who lose the access
[09:04] that okay I I cannot just send a request
[09:07] for reset the password or get the keys
[09:10] back so it gives us a lot of freedom it
[09:14] be gives us a lot of so so sity sorry I
[09:19] don't know the specific word in English
[09:22] but it comes with responsibility so we
[09:24] need to take care of our kids our kids
[09:28] we need to know what to do with Bitcoin
[09:31] we don't have to send to exchanges we
[09:34] don't have to put in a let's say in
[09:36] exchanges with the yield like happened
[09:40] so you need to have your Bitcoin and you
[09:42] need to take care of your keys I think
[09:43] it's mandatory not for freaks not for
[09:46] nerds it's for everyone who wants to be
[09:49] free yeah I often think about that
[09:51] because uh it's it's it's so hard I have
[09:54] a lot of friends that are also in
[09:56] Bitcoin and sometimes even like 100% in
[09:58] Bitcoin but still have it in exchanges
[10:00] and I'm like no you have to do the self
[10:02] custody you have to do uh the the work
[10:06] yourself but it's it's it's I think a
[10:08] learning process uh when you start
[10:10] discovering Bitcoin when you start going
[10:12] into Bitcoin um how did your like
[10:15] learning process and discovering Bitcoin
[10:17] start I found austan economics before or
[10:21] did discover a economics with Bitcoin no
[10:24] the thing is that when I studied
[10:27] economics before Bitcoin
[10:29] and um yeah that that was something that
[10:32] okay I understand Austrian economics my
[10:36] journey with Bitcoin is like I
[10:38] understand a economics I understand all
[10:41] these things but when I when I
[10:44] discovered Bitcoin was around
[10:47] 201
[10:49] 2012 and but that time for us Bitcoin
[10:52] was just another we didn't we didn't go
[10:55] deep into the rabbit hole that's the
[10:57] thing you just discovered this and that
[11:00] time we were doing a lot of things we we
[11:03] come from the online marketing and the
[11:05] online um yeah e-commerce side so
[11:09] basically at that time we saw that oh
[11:12] there is a new uh way to pay that is
[11:15] called Bitcoin and and it's probably
[11:17] like the PayPal probably come up to
[11:20] solve this issues with the credit cards
[11:23] with all the payment transfer all the
[11:26] things so we started the
[11:29] seeing Bitcoin as this way so
[11:34] probably let's say we had to run uh
[11:37] traffic uh on a platform like we we need
[11:41] to buy like online ads in a platform and
[11:44] this platform probably accept credit
[11:47] card only or Bitcoin and at that time
[11:50] our credit cards in Argentina we
[11:53] couldn't pay uh internationally so at
[11:57] that time we okay we just buy Bitcoin I
[12:00] and pay them with Bitcoin so at that
[12:02] time we start seeing Bitcoin as a um as
[12:06] a way of payment as another PayPal or as
[12:09] another like probably we didn't
[12:11] understand too much what was Bitcoin
[12:13] then within the
[12:15] years we start studying more uh about
[12:19] Bitcoin about then started coming the
[12:23] shitcoins but at that time there was the
[12:25] crypto ecosystem and for me and for for
[12:28] my friends we were like okay this is
[12:30] Bitcoin this is ethereum this is uh I
[12:34] don't know Bitcoin cash and for us we're
[12:36] all like the same we didn't understand
[12:38] too much and then came the the pandemic
[12:41] and then we find finally find out the
[12:45] the the Sailor videos and the Sailor
[12:47] explanation and at that time we can say
[12:50] that during the pandemic I went through
[12:53] the rabbit hole so you start
[12:56] understanding that okay all that you
[12:58] think about
[13:00] Bitcoin probably it's not what you were
[13:03] thinking about probably it's not a
[13:04] PayPal and then you start going to
[13:07] YouTube and then you start listening to
[13:10] podcast and then you start uh at that
[13:13] time was the pandemic you cannot travel
[13:15] but last year I went to the conference
[13:18] in Ria in the Bon bger and then you
[13:20] start discovering that Bitcoin is more
[13:24] than a payment method is more than um
[13:29] um store of value is more like a
[13:32] currency is something
[13:35] that is is something that it's like like
[13:39] it's like the the the missing piece of
[13:43] the puzzle to make Humanity free and to
[13:47] make Humanity grow and that's the
[13:50] connection and and then when I
[13:53] understand all of that I oh this is
[13:56] connected with the aan school of
[13:57] economics this is
[13:59] about um all the things that the
[14:03] Austrian School of Economics preach and
[14:06] connected of course with the freedom the
[14:08] freedom of Market the freedom of speech
[14:11] the freedom of of of doing whatever you
[14:13] want and the responsibility of having
[14:17] your kids or taking care of your Bitcoin
[14:19] or not giving your Bitcoin to anyone so
[14:23] I think that that's was the connection
[14:25] with with the aan economics but I
[14:28] understand
[14:29] I knew aan economics like before Bitcoin
[14:32] even existed and I connected like when I
[14:36] went into the rabbit hole just like two
[14:39] or three years ago okay and and you did
[14:42] you started the crocro newsletter uh
[14:46] with someone then or how did these like
[14:49] how did you came from having Bitcoin to
[14:52] also starting posting content about it
[14:54] having now also uh a podcast about it
[14:58] like how did this transformation from
[15:01] seeing Bitcoin but also talking so much
[15:04] about Bitcoin well for me of course like
[15:08] first of all the things that um for bit
[15:13] for Bitcoin to be um a real tool needs
[15:17] to be massive and to make it massive
[15:21] people need to understand what Bitcoin
[15:24] is so like two years ago with my
[15:28] business partner Diego we were like
[15:30] posting a lot into in Twitter about
[15:33] Bitcoin we were in a lot into Bitcoin
[15:36] Bitcoin Twitter so we say okay we were
[15:40] running multiple projects and and we say
[15:42] okay we can start what we disc
[15:44] discovered um uh the newsletter business
[15:48] through YouTube people that were doing
[15:51] and we we subscribe to this uh milk Road
[15:55] um newsletter that is 100% about
[15:59] coins and uh but but we were uh we were
[16:02] studying the newsletter business so at
[16:06] that time we say okay well let's start
[16:09] creating multiple newsletters to see
[16:12] which work better and and one of them
[16:15] was Croc Road the The Good the the thing
[16:17] for Croc road is um because we we are
[16:22] bitcoiners and we want to teach people
[16:24] about Bitcoin we want to preach the
[16:27] world and we want to let's say if I met
[16:30] people if I met friends I talk them
[16:33] about Bitcoin of course Asam an
[16:35] economist my friends asked me what do we
[16:38] do with the money what we do with the
[16:40] money I say 100% Bitcoin C storage and
[16:43] save your keys that's my only advice but
[16:46] they say oh but Bitcoin is related with
[16:49] crime Bitcoin is with money lering uh
[16:51] Bitcoin is is forbidden so for that
[16:54] reason we decided to start this um
[16:57] newsletter
[16:59] to start talking about Bitcoin and and
[17:02] talking about the multiple sides that
[17:05] Bitcoin has again not only as
[17:09] a currency not only as a store of value
[17:13] but more like a philosophical moment mo
[17:17] mo movement and all of the things that
[17:19] Bitcoin put in the in the table so we
[17:22] started with Crossroad in
[17:25] 2022 and initially was initially is like
[17:30] we have multiple things of of the
[17:33] crossroad one is the the the blog the
[17:35] the website that we post like mostly
[17:38] news about Bitcoin mostly news about the
[17:43] this what is happening now uh then we
[17:46] have the newsletter that is the email
[17:48] newsletter that we just select different
[17:51] topics and we write about these topics
[17:54] initially the newsletter was the same
[17:56] articles that we had in our website but
[18:00] now it's totally different and when we
[18:03] came back from the B honer we decided to
[18:08] start the YouTube channel and the best
[18:11] way to start the YouTube channel for us
[18:12] was like in a podcast but I call it
[18:15] podcast but it's not a podcast just just
[18:17] like it's a talk between bitcoiners and
[18:22] and my goal is to share not too many
[18:26] technical aspect because there are a lot
[18:28] of podcast that talk about technical
[18:30] aspect of Bitcoin about the like the the
[18:34] keys about everything and are very good
[18:37] so what I want to give the like the
[18:41] angle of the podcast is bitcoiners
[18:44] talking about Bitcoin not about how
[18:47] Bitcoin is good for the lives more
[18:50] philosophy how they Bitcoin help them to
[18:54] discover new things how Bitcoin help
[18:56] them we have a lot of conversations of
[18:59] totally different uh backgrounds people
[19:02] who is like food tourist people uh we
[19:05] have a conversation with a guy that is
[19:07] in the middle of Argentina teaching
[19:09] Bitcoin to the originally to the to
[19:13] the the our the the Indian communities
[19:16] the the local communities of Argentina
[19:19] uh um and all these things we is good
[19:22] because in the feedback of talking you
[19:25] learn a lot too so I think that this
[19:28] project started in a way to first of
[19:31] all teach about Bitcoin but on the other
[19:34] side learn more about Bitcoin and make
[19:38] the word like Bitcoin massive because as
[19:40] as I told you H most of the people when
[19:43] you start talking about Bitcoin they
[19:44] think that about illegal they think
[19:47] about money lering they think about drug
[19:49] dealing and it's totally the opposite is
[19:52] a tool that can change the world that is
[19:55] going to change the world and it's not
[19:56] related to all this stuff
[19:59] yeah it's interesting because I think
[20:02] like if you look at the statistics if
[20:04] you look at the data it's totally clear
[20:07] that the US dollar is used for a lot of
[20:09] crimes and Bitcoin is just like so much
[20:12] used for crimes of course it's money
[20:14] like Al if if normal people use it also
[20:16] criminals will use it it's like it's
[20:18] like a knife you can make delicious food
[20:20] with it but uh you can also stab someone
[20:23] with like it's we should not ban knives
[20:26] just because of that like it's a it's
[20:28] it's a totally
[20:29] nonsense uh argument and I mean the the
[20:33] only thing I always say oh if every
[20:36] criminal uses it then obviously it has
[20:38] value right it's like why why do all the
[20:41] criminals use it like it's it's not true
[20:43] that's all the criminals use it but if
[20:45] the argument would would be true and all
[20:47] the criminals only use Bitcoin then it
[20:50] has a lot of value like this this would
[20:52] be a complement to bitcoin actually as
[20:55] as I see it yes yes yes yes agree
[20:59] because like again like the the most
[21:02] important thing is the use initially
[21:04] probably the criminals were using that
[21:07] because was a
[21:08] way the point is that initi also for us
[21:12] let's say for criminals there was a way
[21:15] to find a way to pay remember the sil
[21:19] Road uh find a way to pay without being
[21:22] tracked but on the other side at that
[21:25] time at the same time that the the Silk
[21:28] Road was was working there were
[21:31] companies like advertising companies
[21:33] that again I me as an Argentinian our
[21:37] government or our former government used
[21:40] to put a lot of restrictions for us so
[21:43] we cannot move money outside the country
[21:45] we cannot use the credit cards
[21:47] internationally you need to talk to the
[21:50] bank so we wanted to pay advertising to
[21:54] sell our products but we couldn't so at
[21:57] that time
[21:58] the only way was Bitcoin so probably
[22:02] initially there was used by uh criminals
[22:05] but then people say oh but we can do
[22:08] this we can do that and always is a way
[22:11] to have more freedom a question I wanted
[22:13] to ask earlier like you as when I
[22:16] started my podcast and when I started my
[22:18] Twitter presence I learned a lot about
[22:21] Bitcoin additionally and I guess it was
[22:24] the same for you like when you started
[22:26] the the newsletter you got feedback from
[22:28] a community when you start Twitter you
[22:30] get feedback from a community when you
[22:31] start having podcast you get feedback
[22:33] from guests and also from the community
[22:35] uh what did you learn uh additionally to
[22:38] what you learned before from Bitcoin now
[22:40] from the like the community from having
[22:42] a podcast having uh posting memes
[22:45] posting news posting blog articles about
[22:48] Bitcoin getting the community feedback
[22:51] uh what's what are your learnings from
[22:53] from doing all the the content work in
[22:56] Bitcoin yeah well I I I don't have now
[23:00] in in mind what specific things I've
[23:04] learned but for example some good things
[23:08] related to Noster I don't know if you
[23:10] are in
[23:11] Noster um some some good things related
[23:14] to Noster and um obviously uses again
[23:19] like stories or life stories of people
[23:23] about the how do they went into Bitcoin
[23:26] or or how
[23:28] they do to solve certain problems
[23:32] through the Bitcoin perspective how they
[23:35] can use Bitcoin to help people in need
[23:39] so that that's probably uses usages of
[23:42] Bitcoin that I don't I didn't even I
[23:45] didn't even um Discover at that time or
[23:50] or again like stories of the people
[23:52] usages um I don't know like probably
[23:56] things that I I didn't know know that
[23:58] work possible to do but it's it's being
[24:01] done like
[24:03] um some like um some exchanges
[24:08] peer-to-peer exchanges that I discovered
[24:10] through the podcasts and I thought it
[24:12] was totally different and then were
[24:15] totally things that I didn't know that
[24:17] they they exist then I have a call I
[24:21] have a talk with one of the
[24:23] Argentinian uh people that is teaching
[24:26] Bitcoin in Argentina and I discover what
[24:29] are the problems that are are doing for
[24:32] for the massive adoption in in
[24:35] especially in Argentina so all of these
[24:37] things I cannot point one thing that I
[24:39] learn in particular but I learn more
[24:42] about usage I learn more about privacy
[24:47] ER I discover that oh probably things
[24:49] that I'm doing now are not 100% good and
[24:53] and I need to change my way to like take
[24:57] care of my Bitcoins and um and again
[25:01] it's like life stories of of people um
[25:05] The Journey uh how they went to the
[25:08] rabbit hole because again I don't speak
[25:10] we don't speak too technical but but
[25:14] yeah also like yeah of course and they
[25:16] changed me philosophically in in a lot
[25:19] of things I'm super excited to announce
[25:21] that this podcast just got the first
[25:25] ever sponsor I just started podcast out
[25:28] like three months ago and now we have 21
[25:31] Bitcoin as a partner for this podcast 21
[25:36] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[25:39] they teach and preach self custody this
[25:42] is my go to exchange when someone asks
[25:46] me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from
[25:49] this is the easiest entry for bitcoiners
[25:53] and if you want lower fees Plus at the
[25:56] same time support this podcast use code
[25:59] Robin and click the link in the
[26:01] description yeah it's interesting how
[26:03] like the conversations with more and
[26:05] more people because I forc myself to be
[26:08] uh in contact with basically so many
[26:11] bitcoiners because I WR now do seven uh
[26:15] recordings a week I try to push out four
[26:18] episodes a week I probably put it will
[26:20] push it up to like five maybe even six
[26:23] but it's like with the time it's it's
[26:25] difficult so I have speak with so many
[26:27] different bitcoiners every week and this
[26:30] started in like end November beginning
[26:33] of December and you learn about so many
[26:36] different topics there are people like
[26:38] really hard on on how to have the best
[26:40] self cust setup and there are people
[26:42] like you have to always have the privacy
[26:45] in mind with no KC then there are like
[26:47] CEOs from Bitcoin only exchanges then
[26:50] there are marketing people from from
[26:52] different companies it's it's and then
[26:54] there are the the blabs that are in for
[26:57] over 10 years I spoke with already three
[27:00] people that are in Bitcoin for over 10
[27:02] years uh the two of them also wanted to
[27:06] stay private they they wanted to stay
[27:08] Anonymous so like I yes I did the the
[27:12] picture over their their face and stuff
[27:13] like that so it's an interesting journey
[27:15] to get so many different aspects in um
[27:19] and you imagined that you're an
[27:21] Argentina and I mean it's kind of
[27:24] popular in in in in the Bitcoin World
[27:26] Argentina because of the AR pesos
[27:29] reaching new all-time highs in in the in
[27:31] the Bitcoin because of chavier M
[27:34] everybody talked about him for a while
[27:37] how is your view about Argentina right
[27:40] now about the economic system and how
[27:42] maybe also being an Argentina man how
[27:46] did this change a view on on on bitcoin
[27:49] because I am from Austria so the the
[27:51] euro is a lot more stable as Starin peso
[27:56] uh and a lot of austrians don't see the
[27:59] need of having Bitcoin because the this
[28:01] euro is kind of stable it has inflation
[28:04] but not as great as in some other places
[28:08] well in Argentina is like the point is
[28:10] that since the good thing the advantage
[28:12] that we have as argentinians is that
[28:14] since you are a kid you learn to save in
[28:18] hard money because as you said the
[28:20] Argentinian pesso is is the money of the
[28:24] Argentinian politicians and as our
[28:27] President says it it its value is
[28:30] rubbish its value is like because
[28:34] it's the Argentinian Pesos um was
[28:37] incredible because I'm not I I left
[28:39] Argentina I live abroad since
[28:41] 2016 and the most bizarre thing is that
[28:44] when I was living in AR when I left
[28:47] Argentina one Argentinian Pesos uh one
[28:50] US dollar was 15 Argentinian Pesos and
[28:55] last year when I came back in 20 22 to
[28:58] visit my family uh one1 US dollar was
[29:01] 300 Argentinian Pesos and now one1 US
[29:07] dollar is
[29:09] 1,200 Argentinian Pesos inflation last
[29:12] year was 200% Argentina is the country
[29:15] with the biggest inflation in the world
[29:18] and that's something that is a problem
[29:20] that is not for now it's a problem that
[29:23] comes from decades I'm 42 and since you
[29:27] a kid you learn to save in hard money so
[29:30] when you are a kid you learn to save in
[29:32] US Dollars you save in US Dollars when
[29:34] you go let's say when you get a gift in
[29:37] money from your family or your they give
[29:40] you dollars they give you US dollars
[29:42] when I was uh in in the in the church
[29:45] when I took the the first communion and
[29:48] you give like the stamps to the people
[29:50] and people give you money they give you
[29:52] dollars because the Argentinian Pesos
[29:55] the Argentinian Pesos is is is right
[29:57] Rish but on the other side Argentina
[30:01] argentinians are not using too much
[30:04] Bitcoin I talk with the the president of
[30:07] the Argentinian Bitcoin organization and
[30:09] the adoption is is very marginal yet
[30:12] it's very few because people tends to
[30:16] save in US dollar so and they don't they
[30:19] think that the US dollar is hard money
[30:21] because of course compared with the peso
[30:24] everything is har money even like I
[30:26] don't know the Brazilian Real is hard
[30:29] money compared to the PES but I
[30:33] think that when when this again we are
[30:37] super early not only in Argentina we are
[30:39] we are super early worldwide when we
[30:42] start understanding the benefits of
[30:45] Bitcoin towards other other other
[30:48] currencies or or other others saving
[30:52] saving things I think argentinians are
[30:54] going to adop a little bit more uh the
[30:57] pro problem is that people has very big
[30:59] problems now
[31:02] that
[31:04] before thinking about Bitcoin uh today
[31:07] Argentina
[31:09] has 200% and more of inflation rate 50%
[31:14] of the population is poor and uh this
[31:17] year is going to be super tough for
[31:19] Argentina but luckily last all this
[31:24] problem of the governments these last
[31:27] year a totally Outsider called jaier M
[31:32] he won the the elections and become the
[31:34] Argentinian president and and of course
[31:36] it revolutionizes all the the Bitcoin
[31:39] Community because uh he is an Austrian
[31:43] economic he speak a lot about freedom
[31:46] and because in some interview he spoke a
[31:49] little bit about Bitcoin and people sell
[31:52] it as a bitcoiner he's not a bitcoiner
[31:56] but I think that I have like he's not a
[32:00] bitcoiner and but but I think that he's
[32:03] the most um suitable to learn about
[32:07] Bitcoin because I think that now we have
[32:10] again as Argentina has much much bigger
[32:13] problems but I think that if we are able
[32:17] to solve these problems in the near
[32:19] future and if
[32:22] someone that comes to next to our
[32:26] president and talks about Bitcoin I
[32:29] think that it can triggers the the
[32:32] adoption in Argentina faster but now
[32:36] it's not like uh that people is save a
[32:41] lot of Bitcoin first of all because
[32:43] people cannot save in Argentina and the
[32:45] few money that they can save they save
[32:47] in US Dollars and imagine if like okay
[32:51] you can save you save $1,000 then you
[32:54] switch to bitcoin and you say oh I I'm
[32:56] going to have
[32:58] 0.001 Bitcoin it's like no I prefer to
[33:02] have the US dollars
[33:05] but um I think that the Bitcoin
[33:08] Revolution is going to come from these
[33:10] countries from Argentina from Latin
[33:13] America from from Africa people that
[33:16] understand because we have we really
[33:18] understand more than the Europeans the
[33:21] need of having uh hard money to Sav in
[33:26] hard money because our money is
[33:29] worthless probably for you the European
[33:31] you say okay I have Udo the euro is is a
[33:35] stable but after the pandemic with all
[33:38] the money that has been printed in
[33:40] America in Europe in all the countries
[33:43] and this trend is going to continue
[33:45] because politicians like like to print
[33:48] money as I said before they discover
[33:51] that they can do a lot of mistakes and
[33:54] they can like okay they can fix by by
[33:57] printing money they but but printing
[33:59] money is like okay the problems that I
[34:01] have now I don't solve but I I pass to
[34:03] the next president and and and so on but
[34:06] someday this is going to
[34:09] explode 100 and is the solution to to to
[34:12] to this explosion because I remember
[34:15] when we was a kid like you have a game
[34:17] that you need to unfold some gift and at
[34:19] the end you you you get the last one so
[34:22] that you can you can pass the problem
[34:25] from an Administration to another
[34:27] Administration to another Administration
[34:29] to another but somewhere is going to be
[34:31] there when the problem is not possible
[34:35] to be solved anymore that's what happens
[34:37] in
[34:39] Argentina historically and someone is
[34:42] going to have the bomb and going to
[34:44] going explode so and then we need to
[34:47] find a solution the solution for for me
[34:49] is Bitcoin and that's the point in
[34:51] Argentina I think we we have and the
[34:53] president now has much bigger problems
[34:56] to think about but what he wants to do
[34:59] is when to close the central bank and to
[35:04] give freedom of people to use the
[35:07] currency that people want so in that
[35:11] point I think we can we can do something
[35:14] to to do the to make people adop Bitcoin
[35:18] yeah it's a it's a great point and also
[35:21] a lot of I think a lot about uh how
[35:24] Bitcoin adoption and the fear
[35:27] uh adoption the adoption I don't know
[35:30] how to call it like the the ramp off of
[35:33] of of feeld uh will go because uh some
[35:37] countries like Argentina with 200%
[35:40] inflation and a president that says oh
[35:43] the the AR PES the our own currency is
[35:46] rabbish like that's that's an an an an
[35:50] amazing statement from the president
[35:52] usually uh like imagine uh the head of
[35:56] the Central Bank in Europe saying oh our
[36:00] our euro is rabbish like it's completely
[36:02]  if that would be the case ECP
[36:05] says like it's ravish but course of
[36:08] course they don't want to take to tell
[36:10] the people that the currency is ravish
[36:12] because they are part of this scam they
[36:15] are part of this Fiat scam they are part
[36:17] of this legal last week it was uh the
[36:21] anniversary of death of of Carlos of
[36:24] Charles Pony uh and they are part of the
[36:27] the Bony scheme this is the the Fiat
[36:30] when you understand and when you analyze
[36:33] the Fiat system under the school of eon
[36:37] the austan school of
[36:39] economic Vision you realize that it's a
[36:42] pony because you realize what what do
[36:44] the governments do they print more money
[36:47] to pay for the interest of the Deb so
[36:52] they create more and and money if the
[36:54] people don't understand when the
[36:56] government prints money it is generating
[36:58] more debt so the government is creating
[37:01] more debt to pay past
[37:04] debt this is not in Argentina in United
[37:07] States in Europe in the UK here in Hong
[37:10] Kong in mainland China in all the
[37:12] countries the government is doing that
[37:15] they print money to pay for de they
[37:17] print more money to pay for them and
[37:19] next year they will have to print more
[37:21] money to pay for more debt and if you
[37:25] Analyze That this is called a pony
[37:27] scheme so if I am if I am the the
[37:31] director of the Central Bank of course
[37:33] let's say imagine that I put a um a sign
[37:37] in my office and I say if you bring me
[37:40] if you bring me 1,000 US dollar today
[37:44] you will get 1,500 in two months okay
[37:50] people start coming and putting money
[37:52] putting money and then I start paying
[37:55] money with the money of the newcomers
[37:58] I'm not going to tell them what I'm
[38:00] doing in the back because it's is making
[38:03] me
[38:04] money but someday it's going to crash so
[38:07] of course that the central banks they're
[38:09] going to take talk about Bitcoin
[38:11] they are going to try to push the the
[38:13] cdbc in in in the people because they I
[38:18] don't know if they know that they they
[38:20] are inside the pony scheme but they want
[38:23] to they they want to perpetuate this p
[38:26] scheme Forever at least for their period
[38:31] at the in front of the bank because as I
[38:35] said this is like we can pass the
[38:39] problem from one Administration to other
[38:41] but someday is going to explode someday
[38:46] people will understand more how this
[38:49] system works and people will start going
[38:52] to
[38:53] bitcoin and and they are not going to be
[38:56] able to to to do more this this Pony
[38:58] scheme that is called the central B if
[39:01] you st study how money works you say you
[39:06] how come come a bank give a loan and
[39:09] when they give a loan to you they are
[39:11] just printing money they are just
[39:12] putting money in in in the in their in
[39:15] their computer and they create the money
[39:17] from th Air and give it to
[39:19] you like this is crazy but people don't
[39:24] understand and the of course the
[39:25] directors of the banks the director of
[39:28] the Federal Reserve and the main
[39:30] politicians in Davos in the world
[39:32] economic Forum they going to talk oh no
[39:34] because the money blah blah blah and
[39:37] people that's why one of the things that
[39:40] why we started with Cross Road and we
[39:43] support all the community of creators of
[39:46] of bitco of Bitcoin because people we
[39:48] want to give the message to bring the
[39:51] message of Bitcoin to the average people
[39:54] to the for them to wake up because if
[39:56] you go to a conference they talk most of
[40:00] the talks are about like the technology
[40:02] of Bitcoin they are talks of people that
[40:06] are 100% Tech oriented and is a is a
[40:12] like is a circle when though they
[40:15] discuss
[40:17] so in incredible difficult technical
[40:20] stuff that nobody understands so if I
[40:23] try to talk about the people about like
[40:26] all the keys or the coin join on all the
[40:28] things or the people are not going to
[40:31] understand so what I want to do is like
[40:33] bring the
[40:35] Bitcoin to the the real world and make
[40:39] my mom that is 72 understand about
[40:42] Bitcoin
[40:44] so I think that that's the main goal so
[40:47] we can fight this this Pony scheme that
[40:51] that comes from the mass media two
[40:53] points came up to in my mind first of
[40:54] all like it's I think it's really hard
[40:56] to uh explain people like especially
[41:00] older people like um your mom and your
[41:03] like grandads and stuff like that uh
[41:05] Bitcoin because first of all they're not
[41:08] digital native I think it's way easier
[41:10] to explain Bitcoin to like a 15y old
[41:13] because he has he assigns digital things
[41:17] value like he has video games with where
[41:19] he buys skins and where he buys weapons
[41:22] and stuff like that and he knows digital
[41:24] things can have value so for uh younger
[41:28] people it's easier to assign uh digital
[41:31] things value and for older people I
[41:34] think like 50 60 70 plus it's it's just
[41:37] harder because they're not digital uh
[41:40] Native there was like a guest a few days
[41:42] ago and he said like all the people are
[41:44] not digital native they are digital
[41:45] tourists they came from an analog world
[41:48] and went into this digital world so it's
[41:51] not native for them it's not it's not
[41:53] easy for them uh so I I think a lot of
[41:56] about not how to explain Bitcoin to a
[41:58] 5-year-old but how to explain Bitcoin to
[42:00] like a 80y
[42:02] old yes the point is that of course I
[42:06] understand and I'm I'm I put the example
[42:08] of my mom because it's like just extreme
[42:12] my mom is 72 and of course when I talk
[42:15] about Bitcoin to her she said you're
[42:16] gonna go to jail okay I'm not trying to
[42:19] convince my mom to go into bitco but I'm
[42:22] 42 and I have cousins that are around 25
[42:27] something like that and I try to explain
[42:29] to them and not even them understand and
[42:32] or my friends that we are in the middle
[42:35] of the the
[42:36] analogic world with the digital world
[42:39] because we we start we entered to our
[42:44] mature years like to our 20s when
[42:47] internet was coming so we can understand
[42:49] something like that and and not even the
[42:52] people of my generation and even younger
[42:56] and understands about Bitcoin about the
[42:58] power most of Bitcoin is about how the
[43:00] monetary system work and and how Freedom
[43:04] works and
[43:06] how what important is how important is
[43:09] freedom many of the people what
[43:11] happening during the pandemic they okay
[43:14] they just they told you
[43:16] stop go go and stay home where Mas put
[43:21] the vaccine and most of them 98% of them
[43:26] they didn't do another thing that we do
[43:28] in the Bitcoin communities do your own
[43:30] research nobody did their own research
[43:33] because at the time okay there is a a
[43:36] disease that apparently is super deadly
[43:39] or I have to stay home because someone
[43:43] in the in the government
[43:45] says with this happen the same so that
[43:48] that's what we we want to put in in in
[43:51] in in perspective that bit not Bitcoin
[43:54] as only money or are only the way to
[43:58] save your money the way to create
[44:01] generational wealth for you for your
[44:03] children for your grandchildren but the
[44:05] way to be free the way to make everyone
[44:09] free to make everyone
[44:12] Sovereign um that's the point but as we
[44:15] said at the beginning Freedom comes is a
[44:18] very nice word but it comes with a lot
[44:20] of
[44:21] responsibilities so that's what we want
[44:24] to to start to to to give the message to
[44:27] the people of my age and younger
[44:30] that they don't know about Bitcoin they
[44:33] they think that Bitcoin is the same of
[44:35] ethereum or or or Solana or they think
[44:38] that okay we can put the money in
[44:40] binance and and it's okay that for them
[44:43] it's like having the money in binance is
[44:46] this having the Bitcoin in binance is
[44:47] the same and having in a cold storage so
[44:51] that's the thing that we need to make
[44:53] people understand and and I think a lot
[44:56] about if the fat system like as we have
[44:59] it now how how long can it survive
[45:03] because if if we look at it as you said
[45:05] they have Dept and they have to pay back
[45:07] the dep with even more dep and it's like
[45:09] a a vicious cycle where it
[45:12] goes the problem grows bigger and bigger
[45:15] and bigger and it like started kind of
[45:17] in 1971 and from there on it's like if
[45:20] you look at the charts of the the money
[45:22] supply or any depth of Any Nation you
[45:25] see like
[45:26] straight up line um how longer do you
[45:30] think can this can
[45:33] this uh circus go or or will it explode
[45:36] at some point like what's your thoughts
[45:38] on on the I don't know I don't know
[45:41] because there are many problems one of
[45:43] the problem is like this we need to one
[45:46] the problem is the depth of the
[45:48] countries I saw one the guy what is the
[45:51] name of these guys that he was for
[45:54] Bitcoin magazine he was in in in R I
[45:57] don't know how Dylan leair he make a he
[46:01] show a graphic about the trend of the
[46:05] national depth of United States compared
[46:08] with the GDP so now I think that we are
[46:12] like it says like it's around 80% the
[46:15] the depth of United States is 80% of GDP
[46:18] or something like that but in 10 years
[46:21] the dep the ratio is going to be the dep
[46:25] is going to be 200% of the GDP what it
[46:29] means let's say you win now you make
[46:33] 1,000 a month in your job but you you
[46:37] you
[46:38] owe 800 so like you are owing already
[46:43] your debt is 80% of the money that you
[46:45] make you still can pay let's say okay I
[46:48] can pay my debt 80% and for 200 US Euros
[46:53] I don't know how how can survive the
[46:55] months but I can pay but imagine if you
[46:58] make €
[47:00] 1,000 a month but you you owe 2,000 how
[47:04] can you pay that so this of course will
[47:08] bring
[47:09] more money printing I don't know how
[47:12] they going to solve it and they talk it
[47:14] this it's normal it's normal no it's not
[47:16] normal the normal is have de zero that
[47:19] is the normal then you can you can have
[47:22] you can take some deps or some loans in
[47:25] order to let's say I want to expand my
[47:27] business I want to create a new project
[47:30] I'm working in a new product so I need
[47:32] capital and I get a loan but get a loan
[47:36] for like just burning or to make a party
[47:39] and the other thing that is a big
[47:41] problem is the pensions how the pension
[47:44] system works like people that is working
[47:48] today pay the pension to pay the people
[47:51] that is not working the the old
[47:54] generation now like less like the old
[47:58] people is leaving more and the the there
[48:01] are no new people like the new people
[48:03] that is is born is not going to be
[48:07] sustainable let's say when I if I want
[48:09] to retire when I'm 70 or when I'm 65
[48:13] there will not be enough young workers
[48:16] to support my retirement so this is
[48:18] going to be another problem so how is
[48:21] the government going to solve
[48:23] it if we think the way that they have to
[48:26] solve is by printing more money but
[48:28] printing more money gonna be more
[48:30] inflation so I think some somewhere in
[48:35] this decade probably between around 2030
[48:39] or 2030 20 2035 will be probably before
[48:44] 2030 but it will be some kind of like
[48:47] implosion of the system and we need to
[48:50] to reset it they already know because
[48:53] they are coming with the cdbc but the
[48:56] cdbc is not a solution is more more of
[49:01] the problem and of course it's more
[49:03] control from the governments to the
[49:06] people because they are going to give
[49:08] the cdbc you're going to have like a
[49:11] time span to spend and if they want to
[49:14] push more uh consume push more the
[49:18] economy okay you need to to to to to uh
[49:23] I to spend your money faster something
[49:26] like that so that that's the thing so
[49:29] for me the system is going to implode
[49:32] soon and uh but the adoption is growing
[49:37] because like I hope it implodes when
[49:41] some countries already adopted Bitcoin
[49:44] because in that
[49:46] time we be shown the PE who made things
[49:50] correctly and who doesn't so I think
[49:54] that now we are in the stage this Hing
[49:58] is going to be the stage where the Wall
[50:01] Street is coming to bitcoin finally with
[50:03] black rock and all the ETF and I think
[50:06] that for the next haling the Hing is
[50:08] going to be in 2028 I think that many
[50:11] countries will be already inside Bitcoin
[50:15] so if the countries the leaders are
[50:20] smart enough to say okay the collapse is
[50:23] coming we need to put our country into
[50:26] Bitcoin so again I don't have the I'm
[50:30] not a clair buyant but I think that the
[50:33] collapse is going to be soon it's going
[50:35] to be soon like it's going to be 2030
[50:39] 2035 it's going to be soon because there
[50:42] are many problems one is the dep that is
[50:44] growing that is not going to be able to
[50:46] be paid and the other problem is the
[50:47] pensions like people needs more money to
[50:50] leave so they need to solve this problem
[50:52] so it's going to implode soon for that
[50:55] reason the only way people have
[51:00] to protect against all these problems
[51:04] that are coming soon is through Bitcoin
[51:07] that's the only way and if we're now
[51:10] zooming out and we're saying okay the
[51:12] the Fiat system basically imploded and
[51:15] most of the countries uh adopted already
[51:18] a full Bitcoin standard like down the
[51:22] road at some point what will change in
[51:25] that environment like how does a world
[51:27] on a Bitcoin standard look like where
[51:30] everybody pays with satosi and on the
[51:33] lightning payment like what's what's
[51:35] what what do you envision I I I don't I
[51:38] don't think that what I'm saying is like
[51:41] I don't think I don't see the Bitcoin
[51:43] standard being adopted in the short term
[51:46] because we need more kind of technology
[51:50] and and all the things as I said I don't
[51:53] think that I will see see the Bitcoin
[51:57] the massive adoption in my
[51:59] lifespan uh it's going to take more more
[52:01] time but I think that what can happen is
[52:04] like okay the problem we need to reset
[52:07] the system somewhere in this coming
[52:10] decade let's say to to do the things
[52:12] correctly because they can come up with
[52:14] the the cdbc and all this crap and all
[52:18] the things but there is a problem we
[52:21] need to reset the system we need to
[52:22] start from scratch and um
[52:26] the the first the first
[52:29] um measure to solve all this mess is to
[52:32] come back to the dollar or some money
[52:37] Reserve money in the world to be back by
[52:39] hard by a hard asset that can be gold or
[52:44] can be Bitcoin or can be a combination
[52:46] on different um hard assets so that's
[52:52] why I think that M countries will come
[52:56] back with having the Bitcoin as a
[52:59] reserve of value as the countries and
[53:02] and they can print money back in Bitcoin
[53:06] it's like now like okay you want to buy
[53:10] stock you you want to buy stocks for
[53:12] example or you go and you buy micro
[53:15] strategy why because you know that micro
[53:18] strategy is back to
[53:20] bitcoin and that's why or you go and you
[53:23] buy stocks from a minor because it's
[53:26] backed in Bitcoin so I think I don't
[53:28] think that we are going to be able to
[53:30] pay with satoshis in the future in the
[53:34] short term but again many countries
[53:37] Canada Bitcoin and say okay this is our
[53:39] reserve and we our money is going to be
[53:44] packed by Bitcoin so this is going to
[53:46] put the the countries in a powerful um
[53:51] State among against other countries that
[53:55] they don't adopt Bitcoin that's the
[53:57] thing and they can adopt Bitcoin they
[53:59] can adopt gold that I think that what is
[54:01] going to happen is like okay we need to
[54:03] reset the system we need to come back
[54:05] from from to have a reference we cannot
[54:08] print money as crazy so we have to take
[54:12] care of our expenses we cannot do a lot
[54:16] of
[54:17] like stupid expense that the government
[54:20] do we need to cut our our expenses we
[54:23] need to be um responsible we need to be
[54:27] responsible of of what we do and this is
[54:30] something that the experiment that is
[54:33] going to be done in in now is in
[54:36] Argentina because our government our new
[54:38] president as an Austrian Economist he is
[54:42] 100% against of State he says that the
[54:46] state needs to be small needs to provide
[54:49] only um ju Justice and safety to to the
[54:54] inhab habitants he says that taxation is
[54:58] theft and um he says that the government
[55:01] has to spend the money that enters no
[55:05] more they cannot print money so I think
[55:09] that uh if he succeed succeed and I'm
[55:14] 100% sure he's going to be successful I
[55:17] think that many countries will start
[55:18] copying this model and we need to adapt
[55:22] to this and when the system collapse
[55:24] because it's going to collapse they will
[55:26] say okay let's start building from
[55:28] scratch taking the examples of the
[55:31] people who did the things correctly and
[55:33] it's going to come okay we need to go to
[55:35] hard money our money needs to be backed
[55:38] with something hard uh we don't have to
[55:42] spend more money than the money that
[55:45] comes to our pockets because this is a
[55:47] something that everything do everyone
[55:50] needs to do and and I think that in that
[55:52] way we can start reconstructing
[55:56] the world and and one of the things that
[55:59] is going to back the the wealth is
[56:01] Bitcoin because Bitcoin is a store of
[56:03] wealth is a store of energy and is the
[56:06] most perfect thing that has been created
[56:10] by the humans or not I don't know I
[56:13] don't know if Satoshi was a human or or
[56:16] an alien or a t traveler but Bitcoin
[56:19] when you analyze Bitcoin it's like it's
[56:20] the most perfect thing that was created
[56:24] so so why don't we have why not backing
[56:28] our economy against the most perfect
[56:31] thing ever created I think that's an an
[56:34] imp perfect way to to kind of end the
[56:37] podcast and with like Bitcoin and the
[56:40] future outlet and this as as you
[56:42] beautifully said it um we having an end
[56:44] routine in the podcast where the
[56:46] previous guest asked the question for
[56:47] the next guest and it's an interesting
[56:50] question uh for you that came up uh if
[56:53] you weren't working in Bitcoin what
[56:56] would you do
[56:57] now if you sorry again if you would not
[57:01] work in Bitcoin right now like if you
[57:03] would not do anything in Bitcoin what
[57:05] would you do with the time you otherwise
[57:08] would have spent on
[57:10] bitcoin I don't know because like I
[57:12] cannot I cannot think my life without
[57:16] talking about Bitcoin
[57:18] so so probably probably I would be
[57:22] interested in the stock markets
[57:25] uh I will be probably making a podcast
[57:28] about martial arts that I like but but
[57:32] to be honest I think that I don't see
[57:35] myself not thinking about Bitcoin
[57:37] because again it's the most perfect
[57:40] thing that was ever created is the most
[57:44] uh is is is one of the things in one
[57:47] episode of of our podcast a guy says
[57:50] that Bitcoin is uh the currency of a
[57:53] type one civilization the type one
[57:55] civilization is a very Advanced
[57:57] civilization so it's going to is it's
[57:59] something that is going to bring us to
[58:02] be a a better civilization and I think
[58:04] that is the only thing that gives
[58:08] Humanity uh a hope for the future so I
[58:12] hope for the future because again the
[58:14] system will collapse but if we start
[58:17] rebuilding our system our world our
[58:22] human transactions our human human
[58:26] interactions based on the Bitcoin
[58:29] standard the humanity that is going to
[58:32] come probably in
[58:34] 150 200 300 or 500 years is going to be
[58:38] amazing the exponential grow probably I
[58:41] will see a little bit of growth before I
[58:44] go to another dimension uh but I think
[58:49] it's going to be that that's the point
[58:50] that that's why I don't know what I
[58:52] would say if if I was not in Bitcoin
[58:55] probably I would be I would be lost I
[58:57] don't know but because Bitcoin is
[58:59] Bitcoin gives a lot of Hope for the
[59:02] future not for my future because I don't
[59:04] care like every people say okay with 0.1
[59:08] Bitcoin you are generating you are
[59:10] creating generational
[59:11] wealth and at that point I said I don't
[59:15] care about my wealth I care about
[59:17] humanity and I think that this is hope
[59:21] that again bring me hope about the
[59:24] future of human
[59:25] for the new generations and and and and
[59:28] the generation that will come uh is
[59:31] going to be better that's uh that's a
[59:33] beautiful thing uh to to say um where
