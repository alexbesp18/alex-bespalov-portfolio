[00:00] using fiction to talk about Bitcoin and
[00:03] I suppose in a wider sense you know
[00:06] Austrian economics or libertarian values
[00:09] um Freedom technology futuristic sci-fi
[00:12] and fiction is is a great way and at the
[00:14] moment Spain is being heralded as as a
[00:17] economic Wonder because its GDP is
[00:19] growing by sort of 0.5% you come and
[00:22] speak to people on the street and say is
[00:24] your life you know 0.5% better than than
[00:26] last year they're not seeing that growth
[00:29] we're what 5 6% adoption or where the
[00:32] internet was in 1999 2000 there were
[00:35] still people back then saying why do I
[00:37] need the Internet um but in terms of the
[00:39] value that you bring to the table as a
[00:41] writer or a Creator AI would be pretty
[00:44] impressed about the stuff you can do
[00:46] that it can't I believe that human
[00:48] writing will will continue I believe
[00:50] that books will continue to be
[00:52] incredibly important and I think Bitcoin
[00:54] is such a fantastic example of like a
[00:56] niche Bitcoin has read so many books
[01:01] [Music]
[01:03] I saw even that you had a channel on how
[01:06] how to write write in English like uh do
[01:09] where you help people in in in writing
[01:12] which is super interesting I have to
[01:13] check it out because I'm I'm not off I'm
[01:15] not doing any books or something like
[01:17] that but I feel like writing is really
[01:19] cool to craft your own thoughts and and
[01:21] get it down on paper so I'm getting more
[01:24] more into writing my thoughts just out
[01:27] on paper or like on on the computer uh
[01:30] that's really cool what you do that yeah
[01:32] there's there's a lot of crossover with
[01:34] you know all of my different
[01:35] incarnations but um you know a couple of
[01:38] years ago until fairly recently I was
[01:41] you know mainly coaching multilingual
[01:44] writers and that means uh you know
[01:47] writers who use English as a second
[01:48] language but have a very high level of
[01:50] English and often you know are
[01:52] professional or published writers and um
[01:55] yeah my sort of um Journey has been from
[01:59] going from sort of advertising to
[02:00] English teaching to writing and then to
[02:03] helping writers and now to uh you know
[02:05] writing and working in in Bitcoin so
[02:08] it's um it's been quite the journey but
[02:11] it's cool that many of these things
[02:13] still sort overlap and you know I meet
[02:16] bitcoiners from around the world who
[02:17] like yourself English isn't your first
[02:19] language but you know here we are
[02:21] speaking English using English to to
[02:23] spread the good word of um of Bitcoin so
[02:27] that's English is the the standard as as
[02:30] hopefully Bitcoin will be at one point
[02:32] at least as I see it yeah I was actually
[02:36] talking on a podcast a couple of weeks
[02:38] ago about how um uh how Bitcoin is it
[02:42] could be considered a language and um
[02:45] there's a lot of similarities between
[02:47] between Bitcoin and and languages in the
[02:49] in the way that you know there is um
[02:53] perhaps I was saying that the English
[02:55] language especially is a bit more
[02:57] malleable a bit more changeable than
[02:58] than Bitcoin which is like you know the
[03:01] idea is not to change it
[03:03] right interesting how do you see Bitcoin
[03:07] as a language like how how did you draw
[03:09] that comparison between Bitcoin and
[03:11] being a language uh it was actually
[03:14] Daniel uh I think it's called Daniel van
[03:16] wheel forgive me if I got your name
[03:18] wrong Daniel but um another podcaster
[03:20] and he drew the analogy um I can't
[03:23] remember exactly why it was um I do
[03:27] remember that I saw on somebody's
[03:29] LinkedIn profile that they had written
[03:31] proficient in Bitcoin in in as a
[03:34] language you know they said I speak
[03:35] English you know like German Spanish and
[03:38] Bitcoin I thought that's good that's
[03:40] good I'm going to steal that so I mean I
[03:42] guess I suppose it's that many people
[03:44] can can learn it and and to use it and
[03:47] it has several different use cases uh
[03:51] it's like a sort of tree you know
[03:53] language is often referred to as a tree
[03:55] and they're they're interconnected and
[03:57] and linked and Sprout into different um
[04:01] different uses um but I suppose at the
[04:04] root of the tree would be the would be
[04:07] like Bitcoin core right yeah there's
[04:10] like two things that like obviously like
[04:12] a programming language is definitely for
[04:14] me a language but also like Bitcoin
[04:16] itself when you use it um it's sort of a
[04:20] a language where you have always an
[04:23] address communicating a value to another
[04:26] address uh and and that and and it's
[04:29] very similar to what language is trying
[04:32] to communicate like we are
[04:34] transporting one thing to another and
[04:37] language is kind of the the the
[04:39] transport layer for that and and Bitcoin
[04:42] also is just transporting communic
[04:45] transporting information in in in the in
[04:48] the Raw sense of it I never looked at it
[04:51] it that way but it it makes sense I I
[04:54] think another interesting point about
[04:56] language and especially with AI coming
[04:58] into things is is
[05:00] that passes information which is there
[05:03] you know words which are there which can
[05:04] be uh formulated and tabulated and uh
[05:09] brought into existence a lot of writing
[05:13] especially but language and
[05:14] communication is done sort between the
[05:16] words um there's a lot of information
[05:19] which we can impart by what is not said
[05:22] what's implied
[05:24] by um meanings which can't be defined as
[05:28] one thing and and I guess that's that's
[05:31] another difference between you know
[05:32] programming language which is binary and
[05:36] linguistic language which is you know
[05:39] much less so it's probably uh really
[05:42] hard to to to put the right words in the
[05:45] in a book to make the point that you
[05:47] really want to make it's probably way
[05:48] easier on in an Audi book I I guess in
[05:51] Audi book you have the component of the
[05:53] voice also and in a in a written book
[05:56] you kind of have to imagine how's the
[05:58] auor kind of intended to to to do that
[06:02] yeah I think it depends on your um
[06:04] personality and your um strengths I know
[06:07] many writers who are absolutely
[06:10] terrified of you know appearing on video
[06:13] public speaking all that kind of stuff
[06:15] so they used to express themselves only
[06:18] in a written sense with a long period of
[06:22] time um
[06:24] and I I guess now you know myself
[06:27] included uh writers have to be a bit
[06:29] more public facing and sort of be happy
[06:32] to to um build an audience and you know
[06:36] uh use social media and and put
[06:38] themselves out there because because
[06:40] otherwise you know we don't have anyone
[06:41] to speak to or to write to interesting
[06:45] that uh that kind of social media forces
[06:48] writers to be uh more content creators
[06:51] than they they used to
[06:53] be yeah I mean you're in the same boat I
[06:56] suppose with podcasting like it's
[06:58] fantastic that anyone in the world can
[07:00] can start a podcast um but that doesn't
[07:02] mean that the the most successful
[07:04] podcasters are just lucky um is because
[07:08] they've hit upon the right formulas to
[07:10] build an audience and to to deliver
[07:14] valuable you know content to them and
[07:17] it's exactly the same with writing you
[07:18] know anyone can can write anyone can
[07:20] publish um but that means there's a lot
[07:23] of competition and really now it's about
[07:26] building an audience um more than
[07:30] uh writing well you know doesn't really
[07:32] matter sort of what you write as long as
[07:35] people are people are listening that's
[07:37] kind
[07:38] of
[07:39] the and it's also interesting because I
[07:42] have not this podcast I have now over
[07:44] 400 guests on my podcast and uh every
[07:47] time I go to a presentation go to like a
[07:51] public event go to somewhere where like
[07:53] I meet in person and people know about
[07:55] my podcast um people usually ask me what
[07:59] I want to do with my podcast and they
[08:01] usually also ask like oh like do you
[08:03] plan to make articles do you plan to
[08:05] make books around the podcast because
[08:07] you have so much information with all
[08:10] the different guests like literally over
[08:11] 400 different guests that talk about one
[08:13] specific topic Bitcoin but there like a
[08:16] lot of information in there a lot of
[08:17] things that you can do with that and and
[08:19] they kind of like uh I would not say
[08:23] forc me to do that but they they kind of
[08:26] ask so much that um it's so present in
[08:29] my my head that I I could write a book
[08:32] with the podcast I'm like okay like I'm
[08:34] I'm no writer at all like I failed
[08:36] German classes I failed English classes
[08:38] I I I had to repeat the class because of
[08:40] English and now I'm speaking English
[08:42] every day as my my profession so I I'm
[08:45] really bad with language I'm really bad
[08:47] with grammar I often make grammar
[08:49] mistakes in the title or like in the
[08:51] description people point that out to me
[08:53] people also make fun of like how I
[08:56] pronounce certain words just because
[08:57] like language is actually not
[09:00] my strength which is funny because now
[09:02] I'm a podcast host and I'm earning my my
[09:05] money with with with speaking um but uh
[09:08] it's it I'm I'm getting more and more
[09:11] warmed up to the idea that I actually
[09:12] write a book and my my first step
[09:15] towards that is that I actually just
[09:18] write down my thoughts and trft my my
[09:20] things and it it's it's a it's an
[09:21] interesting Journey it pushes me out of
[09:23] my comfort zone because I I rather just
[09:26] sit down and talk so I rather do the
[09:27] thing that offers might not
[09:29] like to do just be out there in video
[09:31] and then just talk uh and for me it's
[09:34] really hard to like just sit down and
[09:36] and write but it really changes how how
[09:38] your mind works and how you think about
[09:41] uh things and I I do enjoy that process
[09:44] already well well I think when you've
[09:47] experienced enough of a of a journey um
[09:51] which is you know similar to a story
[09:53] which has a beginning middle and it's
[09:55] you know there's some kind of change
[09:57] realization you know of of course
[09:59] Bitcoin is is that for many people but
[10:01] you know personal stories I think are
[10:05] very
[10:06] underutilized like you know how many
[10:08] books about Bitcoin do we have many and
[10:11] they're brilliant they're well worth
[10:13] reading I've read most of them and um
[10:16] maybe not most of them but a lot of
[10:18] them um but they're really just framing
[10:23] a complex Topic in a different way and
[10:27] that may reach a new audience
[10:30] um I've just been reading the big print
[10:33] by uh by Larry Lepard and
[10:36] um I think that's that's a a good
[10:39] example right of a book which I'm not
[10:41] sure it says
[10:42] anything incredibly different to what's
[10:46] been said before or new but it's uses a
[10:49] bit of his personal life and his
[10:52] personal experience um and it certainly
[10:54] will reach a new audience because he's a
[10:56] trfi guy he's an older guy and I'm sure
[10:58] many of his contacts and people that
[11:00] he's worked with throughout his career
[11:03] will you know discover um something
[11:06] about Bitcoin through the
[11:07] book um but yeah what was I saying that
[11:10] that there are maybe too many books
[11:13] about Bitcoin and explanations and and
[11:16] guides and such and you know my ethos is
[11:20] I'm not a technical guy I'm not somebody
[11:23] who's drawn to bitcoin because I want to
[11:24] know how lightning works and I want to
[11:27] run a node uh that's not me
[11:29] I am more emotive and I like stories and
[11:34] and uh you know that's what captures my
[11:37] interest and I think the
[11:39] next billion people that are on boarded
[11:42] to bitcoin that's how they they get
[11:44] there is through hearing a personal
[11:48] story which Sparks their interest um one
[11:52] which keeps cropping up I don't know his
[11:55] name but he's the the um Welsh guy uh
[11:58] who
[12:00] uh lost his laptop in a landfill in like
[12:03] a rubbish tip and every 3 months or so
[12:08] the story develops more there's like a
[12:10] new news article about his fight with
[12:13] the city council to try and search
[12:16] through the the tip to get his um laptop
[12:19] back um that story I kind of think is
[12:23] often brought up by Legacy Media cuz
[12:26] they want to sort of laugh at a guy
[12:27] who's having to sift through rubbish and
[12:29] like haha Crypt bro has lost his coins
[12:31] and like he's been knocked down and 10
[12:33] years later he's still crying about you
[12:35] know losing 600 million Euros or
[12:37] whatever
[12:39] um but it goes to show that like people
[12:42] are interested because it's a real
[12:44] person who's you know searching for
[12:45] treasure in in the dump and like he had
[12:48] it all and he lost it like there's
[12:50] something about that story which is just
[12:52] so um engaging that it keeps coming back
[12:55] up and I My Hope Is that um we get
[13:00] different stories and some more positive
[13:03] stories um coming out as well and that's
[13:07] my sort of mission too interesting the
[13:10] the personal story toucher and you're
[13:13] totally right there are so many books
[13:15] about Bitcoin and also like completely
[13:18] right there it's it's there are two uh
[13:23] facets of Bitcoin books there's there is
[13:26] always the problem with the F system and
[13:29] then there's the solution which is then
[13:31] Bitcoin and this is probably the the two
[13:34] main things that are always described in
[13:36] Bitcoin textbooks and they put it in a
[13:40] different frame all the time funny
[13:42] enough uh the previous guest to you
[13:44] actually was Larry La talking about the
[13:47] Bitcoin book that it's really funny that
[13:50] that you bring him up without knowing
[13:52] who that he was the previous guest
[13:54] because it's still not published so you
[13:56] have no no way of knowing that B liked
[14:00] it really cool uh the the world is some
[14:05] small but yeah it's that is very true
[14:08] and and super super interesting I just
[14:11] had the thought of my sister in mind
[14:13] actually where I'm like there's no way
[14:16] in hell I
[14:18] can uh convince her of reading the big
[14:22] print like no way like I I will give it
[14:24] to her she will probably read the first
[14:26] five pages and like ah
[14:29] what what what what do I do with that
[14:31] book not because it's not a good book
[14:32] it's an amazing book like it describes
[14:35] it really really good I think um but uh
[14:38] also like with the Bitcoin standard
[14:40] which is an also an incredible book and
[14:42] I think it's almost like a Bitcoin Bible
[14:44] and almost every Bitcoin probably has
[14:46] read that one book but what probably um
[14:51] piques her interest more because she's
[14:53] really into novels really into like
[14:55] stories like she doesn't uh read that
[14:58] many textbooks so a a book where uh it's
[15:03] it's a novel and I it's a personal story
[15:07] who someone who found Bitcoin and it's
[15:09] really intriguing where like his life
[15:11] story is kind of in the in the Forefront
[15:13] and Bitcoin is just like one part of
[15:16] that story or maybe like even the
[15:18] futuristic story where it just plays in
[15:20] the the year uh
[15:24] 2140 uh and it it describes how Bitcoin
[15:27] World works and I those books there are
[15:30] not that many books of those like 21
[15:32] Futures and we we should talk about also
[15:35] what you were doing then but like those
[15:38] those are really rare cases and and I
[15:40] think you're absolutely right we need
[15:42] more of those to hand out to people and
[15:45] and gather a whole new audience in in
[15:48] that way I like the way of thinking
[15:50] thanks yeah I think um you know my
[15:54] mission is is is a bit longer term and
[15:56] it's with some people it will be more
[15:59] softly softly with some people it would
[16:01] be more direct but being too direct is
[16:04] is the issue I think with X being such a
[16:08] strong community and Bitcoin being such
[16:10] a strong supportive um but insular
[16:14] Community bitcoiners have learned to
[16:16] speak to each other by saying things
[16:18] like study Bitcoin you go up to somebody
[16:20] on the street and say excuse me you
[16:23] should study Bitcoin they'll be like why
[16:26] why should like you may as well say
[16:28] study rocket science or study you know
[16:31] crop rotation in the Middle Ages or
[16:33] something like nobody cares so those the
[16:37] only people who do care are people who
[16:39] are you know already curious and Keen to
[16:43] know more about the technical side of of
[16:46] solutions the problems that they might
[16:48] already be aware of like you said you
[16:49] know there's the problem and then the
[16:51] the solution side so most people don't
[16:53] want to study Bitcoin they won't listen
[16:56] um if you go to somebody on the street
[16:58] and say have you heard that there is a
[17:01] man in Wales rooting through a Rubbish
[17:04] Tip every day he's trying to buy the
[17:07] landfill site from the council so that
[17:10] he can recover $600
[17:13] million uh on a hard drive some people
[17:17] might be like that's interesting tell me
[17:19] more you know I'm involved in the story
[17:21] now I guess some people might say oh
[17:24] well you know he's a stupid Crypt oh I
[17:26] don't care you know that's his business
[17:29] and you may have to take a more softly
[17:31] softly approach and like you said with
[17:34] you know there are ways where you can
[17:37] frame a story using fiction that doesn't
[17:41] even mention Bitcoin you know I suppose
[17:43] Star Trek is a great example of of a a
[17:47] Sci-Fi series and series of movies that
[17:50] um bring
[17:52] up societal issues like you know race
[17:56] problems um and you know uh
[17:59] Wars between between
[18:01] countries without explicitly saying this
[18:05] is what we're teaching you this is what
[18:06] we're telling you this is what we're
[18:08] making you think about um and I think
[18:10] that's really the idea of um of using
[18:14] fiction to talk about Bitcoin and I
[18:18] suppose in a wider sense you know
[18:20] Austrian economics or libertarian values
[18:23] um Freedom technology futuristic sci-fi
[18:26] and fiction is is a great way to do that
[18:30] because you know you can make these you
[18:32] can really take things to the to an
[18:34] extreme degree you can have things
[18:36] happening in outter space or so far in
[18:38] the future that you know a new
[18:39] technology exists which is really
[18:41] exciting but um I I hope and I think
[18:44] that um that will touch the the hearts
[18:48] and get get people you know thinking
[18:51] about these these issues it certainly
[18:54] does for
[18:55] me what what inspired you to to to write
[18:58] the the book I think 21 future it's
[19:01] called right yeah um I suppose being
[19:03] honest uh two
[19:06] things uh and it's an interest I don't
[19:08] know if I've told the sort of the truth
[19:11] of it all before so this is like an
[19:13] exclusive to the Robin say podcast um in
[19:18] my coaching work I talked a little bit
[19:20] about you know helping multilingual
[19:22] writers I worked with a client um Nico
[19:26] Lan shout out to Nico he runs ensus
[19:30] Network and he basically orange buil me
[19:33] I knew absolutely nothing about Bitcoin
[19:35] and was helping him uh go through some
[19:37] articles and and you know thoughts on uh
[19:40] book
[19:42] writing um and I
[19:44] became interested in Bitcoin he was very
[19:49] good and softly orange bued Me by just
[19:51] sending me books and saying hey have a
[19:53] look at that and I read several several
[19:55] books um K fol I think was probably one
[19:59] of the first um Bitcoin books I
[20:02] read um a few months
[20:05] later I had an idea to create an
[20:09] anthology with a publisher in the UK so
[20:11] an anthology is a a collection of short
[20:14] stories fiction from different authors
[20:16] and they they're collated and and put
[20:18] into a book usually on some kind of
[20:20] theme right so you might have horror
[20:21] Anthology you this one was about um
[20:24] cities around the world and the
[20:27] publisher kind of Knocked me back or
[20:29] didn't really take me very
[20:31] seriously um and I thought I want to put
[20:34] an anthology out and then I thought hey
[20:37] I know a publisher and how can I sell
[20:42] something to this publisher well it's
[20:45] got to be something new
[20:47] and there had been and I'm writing about
[20:50] this more now and putting together um
[20:53] some articles on on bitcoin fiction
[20:56] there had been you know fiction books
[20:59] which not only mention Bitcoin but were
[21:00] about Satoshi or about you know the
[21:03] birth of Bitcoin um but there hadn't
[21:07] been a sort of book set in the Bitcoin
[21:11] verse as I call it like a universe in
[21:14] which it makes up
[21:16] the uh a large part of the economy
[21:19] people are using as a medium exchange
[21:21] maybe sometime in the
[21:23] future um so yeah I went to Nico with
[21:25] this idea and 21 Futures was born I
[21:28] thought
[21:29] let's really go with 21 we can have 21
[21:31] stories um from different authors and I
[21:35] managed the the project that the first
[21:37] book uh Tales from the time

[26:00] more people to come on board and and
[26:02] share um you know their vision of of
[26:05] what the future may
[26:08] be what is the what is the tales from
[26:12] the time chain about is it like a
[26:13] fictional uh world where uh it described
[26:18] where how bitcoin's world looks like or
[26:21] so the the Mandate for 21 except for
[26:26] Tales from the time chain which is our
[26:28] first
[26:28] Anthology um it has 21 different stories
[26:31] in which we sourced from from um lots of
[26:35] different authors um who were invited
[26:37] some of them were invited to contribute
[26:38] some of them um responded to our call
[26:41] for submissions um the the Mandate for
[26:44] that was not stories about Bitcoin but
[26:48] stories in which Bitcoin plays a role so
[26:52] you know we didn't want oh who is satosi
[26:55] Nakamoto and or satoshi's on the run or
[26:59] we didn't want stories yet about
[27:01] somebody who invented something world
[27:04] changing more about characters who for
[27:09] whatever reason were were in danger you
[27:11] know we had stories set in in Algeria in
[27:14] outter space in the future we had like a
[27:16] fantasy story from Yanni appleberg as I
[27:19] sort of set in a in a fictional past um
[27:22] but it was um yeah really the the
[27:25] Mandate was not stories about what
[27:28] Bitcoin is or how it works or why it's
[27:31] important but stories in which it it
[27:34] plays some kind of role helps a
[27:36] character maybe even hinders a character
[27:39] of course there's a lot of dangers with
[27:41] you know associated with owning Bitcoin
[27:43] as well so we had some stories which
[27:45] were which were more happy and maybe
[27:48] stories which were more
[27:51] dystopian I love that yeah we we we need
[27:54] those those stories and it all crafts it
[27:57] kind of gives something
[27:58] uh to think about really cool um how did
[28:01] you you already told a little bit uh um
[28:04] the the NCO and niik was also uh already
[28:07] on the podcast uh how how niik orange
[28:09] peeled you but what made it click for
[28:12] you like when when you read the books
[28:13] when you read the the things what what
[28:15] made it so like oh okay Bitcoin could be
[28:19] something really really good yeah I I
[28:22] hope this will be of interest to your to
[28:24] your listeners and um that they will
[28:27] have the
[28:29] if they have a vastly different
[28:31] experience I think my experience is
[28:33] probably similar to a way a lot of
[28:35] normies nowadays will get orange pilled
[28:38] and that is I had no technical
[28:40] background you know I don't care about
[28:42] C++ and and lightning nodes and things
[28:48] um I don't have a financial background
[28:51] you know if you would ask me what's the
[28:52] difference between a security and a
[28:54] commodity and an equity and stuff two
[28:56] three years ago I wouldn't have been
[28:58] able to tell you so it's been a a big
[29:00] learning experience what made it click
[29:04] was um I think Nico was writing an
[29:08] article about inflation and it was you
[29:11] know at the point postco where inflation
[29:14] was had really ramped up to sort of
[29:18] 20% and I realized I didn't really
[29:21] understand why inflation happened and I
[29:24] just accepted that it that it did happen
[29:27] so I suppose that
[29:29] was one of the rabbit holes of just
[29:32] understanding that there is a type of
[29:34] money which has a fixed Supply and a
[29:37] type of money which doesn't and one of
[29:40] them is screwing over and I think um
[29:44] actually somebody pointed me towards the
[29:47] another book that I edited pointed me
[29:49] towards the bank of England you know the
[29:51] central bank and for the UK their
[29:54] website and there's a a bit of it that
[29:56] says what is inflation and it doesn't
[29:59] describe what inflation is at all it
[30:00] just skirts around the issue and says oh
[30:03] when prices go up and stuff it's like
[30:05] the central bank is just openly like
[30:08] to um so inflation was the answer of
[30:12] what really um blew the the top off um
[30:18] my sort of don't know if that's the
[30:20] right analogy but been removed the
[30:22] blinkers from um the sort of Fiat world
[30:25] that I was that I was living in and got
[30:26] me curious enough to
[30:28] to start asking questions and I think um
[30:32] that's a great starting point for for a
[30:35] lot of people I just I just Googled it
[30:37] to see how how they they describe it and
[30:41] they directly they basically just show
[30:44] CPI and for them CPI is inflation maybe
[30:49] I can I can also show that um it it's
[30:53] they they just go of like oh uh what's
[30:56] the rate of uh inflation what is
[30:59] inflation and then it's just like oh
[31:00] like CPI and the target 2% like it's
[31:03] it's literally just then an an an
[31:06] advertisement for what the the central
[31:07] bank is uh is is kind of wanting uh to
[31:11] have that's that that's that's crazy
[31:13] yeah but but I think I think it's
[31:16] probably all of the banks sites probably
[31:18] describe it in that
[31:21] way and unfortunately also the all
[31:24] economic books uh they are usually
[31:27] written like that they don't they don't
[31:29] talk about inflation being the monetary
[31:32] expansion or H being caused by the
[31:35] monetary expansion they go kind of like
[31:38] oh like if prices go up that's inflation
[31:41] or like they they are talking about even
[31:44] Wars and and and other things uh that
[31:47] that cause inflation uh and they usually
[31:51] don't just put the thinger on the the
[31:54] thing that actually cause inflation
[31:55] which is monetary expansion uh which is
[31:58] super interesting to see that they kind
[31:59] of want to wash that away and and kind
[32:02] of confuse people with many different
[32:04] theories it's also kind of sad to to to
[32:07] see that there's so many uh misguided
[32:12] information sorry to interrupt I think
[32:14] if you ask people on the street 100
[32:16] people on on the street in most
[32:18] countries Europe America you know Asia
[32:20] elsewhere what causes inflation at an
[32:23] estimate I would say definitely more
[32:25] than half of them would not say uh money
[32:28] printing know I'd say something like 80
[32:31] 90 95% would start saying things like or
[32:34] oil prices or you know Wars and uh you
[32:37] know certain geopolitical
[32:41] events um when really those are the the
[32:45] symptom rather than the the cause of it
[32:47] so yeah I think that's the one of the
[32:50] key breakthroughs to make is when the
[32:53] financial press and and Legacy Media
[32:56] stop gas lighting everybody and just
[32:59] saying oh inflation is caused by
[33:02] anything other than
[33:03] or you know there's also a lot of like
[33:06] oh surprise inflation whenever the
[33:10] figures are announced I think it was
[33:11] just yesterday in the states they
[33:13] announced 3% and they said oh it was
[33:15] higher than expected it's like
[33:18] you guys knew exactly what to expect
[33:20] because you pushed a button which
[33:21] printed 3% more money and
[33:25] uh it's
[33:27] and and they kind of have to be
[33:29] surprised to the to the to the downside
[33:31] I feel like because they're printing a
[33:33] lot more money than we actually have
[33:34] inflation rate so so they they print
[33:38] like 10% and and then it an inflation
[33:41] rate of 10 of 3% and they're like oh
[33:44] like just that much they have to be
[33:47] surprised of the down because there
[33:48] deflationary force and then they also um
[33:51] usually Define what's in the basket of
[33:54] what they are calculating inflation like
[33:56] that it's a deep Rev all uh that that
[33:59] broke a lot of a lot of
[34:01] thinking um barriers for me once I
[34:04] discovered it I'm like like what that I
[34:07] always because I never questioned
[34:10] inflation as CPI like for me inflation
[34:13] was always CPI uh even when I was
[34:15] investing in stocks and I was actually
[34:17] successful in the stock market before
[34:19] Bitcoin so I was like all right
[34:21] inflation inflation is cpri and um you
[34:24] kind of are in this this feared mindset
[34:26] and then you like just just keep going
[34:28] with with that and once someone breaks
[34:31] that it's it's really powerful these
[34:33] figures that
[34:35] um are fed to People by the media I mean
[34:38] another one is GDP that makes not a bit
[34:41] of difference to people's lives uh I
[34:44] live in Spain and at the moment Spain is
[34:46] being heralded as a as an economic
[34:48] Wonder because its GDP is growing by
[34:50] sort of 0.5% whereas other European
[34:54] nations are are not and everybody's
[34:56] saying hey what's Spain doing
[34:58] you come and speak to people on the
[34:59] street and say is your life you know
[35:02] 0.5% better than than last year no right
[35:07] they're not seeing that growth they're
[35:09] not seeing that increase in wealth it's
[35:12] just a number
[35:14] which you know tracks overall uh
[35:18] production and that does not help most
[35:21] people who are working at 9 to5 they're
[35:25] seeing significant inflation and getting
[35:28] poorer every year and looking around
[35:31] saying what's going on why do I have to
[35:33] work harder and you know I think that's
[35:36] another thing that we need to break is
[35:38] the
[35:40] um is the Reliance on these old metrics
[35:43] which are just not relevant to to people
[35:46] on the street that's how we we can
[35:49] orange pill people with saying what is
[35:50] relevant to you well you know think
[35:52] about
[35:54] that so B it's also um it's like
[35:58] they denominates the GDB obviously in a
[36:01] field currency so of course it's
[36:04] growing exactly you devalue the the fear
[36:07] currency like it can only go up like we
[36:11] can only grow and it's actually really
[36:12] interesting um uh when I was in in and I
[36:16] remember that day actually weird enough
[36:18] like five six years ago when I was in
[36:20] school and uh I I it was it was known to
[36:24] people that I was in in in stocks and I
[36:26] was researching a lot in there it was
[36:28] like the beginning of my investing
[36:29] career I was like 18 19 years old and
[36:33] and and a work a school colleague came
[36:36] up to me and said like oh why is it
[36:38] actually that we that the economy grows
[36:41] every year like why are we getting
[36:43] bigger every year um and and I never had
[36:47] the answer to that and then I'm like
[36:50] yeah like if if we are earth like Earth
[36:52] is always earth like we always have like
[36:55] yeah maybe getting more so like there's
[36:58] like the human population gets better
[37:01] we're getting more efficient in things
[37:03] um but is that really growing anything
[37:05] like what what what does that like what
[37:07] is the number that manifests that uh and
[37:11] what I was not uh knowing back then was
[37:14] like the number that we're valuing that
[37:17] growth in is devaluing and and therefore
[37:20] the number is obviously growing uh and
[37:22] just because the GDP is growing with 5%
[37:25] doesn't mean we're growing 5% it's
[37:28] probably we we actually having less or
[37:31] less but there is this this um this
[37:34] deflation where um and also I think
[37:38] we're getting in general a little bit
[37:40] more wealthier if you look at the uh if
[37:43] you zoom out long enough um because if
[37:46] you look now like probably most of the
[37:48] fuels here could get on a plane and and
[37:52] could fly to another country and if you
[37:55] just look back like 100 200 years
[37:58] not the richest man alive couldn't do
[38:00] that like if you look back long enough
[38:02] all the things that we are now doing on
[38:04] on like a normal basis the richest man
[38:07] alive at some point couldn't do that uh
[38:09] in in in the in the history so we're
[38:12] getting wealth here we're getting we can
[38:14] do more
[38:15] things but we're not like really growing
[38:19] like I don't know what what the metric
[38:20] for growing in that sense would be I
[38:23] mean I really love Jeff Bo's work and
[38:25] when he talks about um
[38:28] stuff like this because you know we're
[38:29] getting
[38:30] more wealthy or rich in the sense that
[38:33] we can buy a microwave for for 40 bucks
[38:36] whereas you know 50 years ago it cost
[38:37] thousands um and people couldn't afford
[38:41] it so in terms of technology is so
[38:44] deflationary that we we're
[38:46] experiencing massive gains and and
[38:48] abundance but we you know if you could
[38:51] remove the Fiat economy from that we'd
[38:55] be experiencing
[38:57] uh or if you could change the fat
[38:59] economy rather we'd be experiencing that
[39:01] that
[39:02] abundance tenfold or or certainly in
[39:05] other um aspects of of life as well it's
[39:09] like our in a way we might have more
[39:11] stuff we might have bigger TVs um but
[39:14] you know are we healthier and happier
[39:16] and and doing better I don't know so
[39:19] there's a quality aspect to it as well I
[39:23] think what do you think is the the story
[39:26] to breakthrough in the mainstream if if
[39:29] you look like you made the Star Trek of
[39:32] Star Wars i' never watched any of those
[39:35] don't even know what the the difference
[39:37] is don't get mad at
[39:39] me uh but like the a story where they
[39:43] describe the problems without describing
[39:46] the problems really and just showing
[39:47] them with a with a story um something
[39:50] that could get real mainstream that
[39:53] shows the the Bitcoin that shows the the
[39:56] problem of money printing um if you had
[40:00] to guess like what what kind of story
[40:02] would that be would that a personal
[40:04] story following a human being with that
[40:05] like a fictional uh science fiction uh
[40:08] in the future story like um H H how
[40:11] would it be possible to make basically
[40:15] what we have in the big print in a
[40:18] really nice story that doesn't even
[40:21] mention Bitcoin uh that that that's kind
[40:24] of like my my thought right now good
[40:26] question I suppose like the what 1984 is
[40:30] for surveillance and
[40:32] totalitarian you know government
[40:36] overreach um for the world of Finance I
[40:40] mean I hope that we will see a you know
[40:43] big bestseller like that or a big movie
[40:46] which comes out and and blows the lid
[40:48] off
[40:50] the difficulties of of our financial
[40:54] system I mean in reality I think there's
[40:57] so many different approaches and ways
[41:00] that this idea spreads
[41:03] to become the norm part of that is
[41:08] through acceptance by traditional media
[41:11] and um you know Trad is sort of getting
[41:14] on board now we're going to see more
[41:16] financial press posting at least
[41:19] balanced articles rather than stupid
[41:22] articles saying that Bitcoin uses too
[41:24] much energy or things like that um
[41:28] and is still massive Grassroots movement
[41:30] of course you know
[41:32] there's so many people like myself who
[41:35] who come on board and think of new and
[41:38] Powerful ways to
[41:40] to do work and spread the message and it
[41:43] becomes very meaningful for for me and
[41:45] the others who who who read or or listen
[41:49] or consume this
[41:51] work yeah as for what would be the I
[41:53] don't think there'll be necessarily one
[41:55] massive Blockbuster or breakthrough that
[41:57] that suddenly makes everyone realize
[41:58] because hey you know 1984 was written
[42:02] you know um post World War II saying you
[42:06] know there are dangers of of government
[42:10] expansion and
[42:11] overreach and it's still a more
[42:14] important book now almost than when it
[42:17] was written even though it was written
[42:18] as a cold war sort of argument against
[42:22] totalitarianism we're experiencing that
[42:24] more and more uh the eyes of Big Brother
[42:28] on us so um yeah and I just wanted to
[42:32] mention as well in terms of a bestseller
[42:34] um there have been books which you know
[42:37] are starting to
[42:38] legitimize Bitcoin in the fiction world
[42:41] as well I know saf Amos is is going to
[42:44] release his um his fiction book uh very
[42:47] soon ly Oren's been talking about
[42:49] writing a fiction book and last year
[42:52] there was in February I think a um
[42:57] Thriller writer called Steve Barry who's
[43:00] an American he's written dozens of books
[43:03] and is is a kind of bestseller and he
[43:06] released a book called The the atlas
[43:08] maneuver which is a a thriller with a
[43:11] split timeline and I think at least half
[43:13] of it is is um directly about soort
[43:17] cryptography and Bitcoin and you know
[43:20] that in itself means people in a book
[43:22] group are talking about Bitcoin learning
[43:24] but what is this you know why do we need
[43:25] it why was it in the story
[43:28] you know people in the New York Times
[43:30] are writing reviews about that
[43:32] book it's it's comes from many angles so
[43:36] it can be Blockbusters it can be
[43:38] Grassroots movements uh it can be
[43:40] through uh top down instruction and you
[43:45] know the day we see in a publication
[43:47] like the New York Times Like a guide to
[43:50] you know self- custody or something we
[43:52] know we've we've made um mainstream
[43:56] adoption
[43:57] but but until then I think it's going to
[43:59] come from many different angles and
[44:00] there's many ways to tell stories and
[44:02] and to influence
[44:04] people yeah and that is kind of the we
[44:07] we have to get to to as many different
[44:09] angles and um then also we increased
[44:12] odds of one just going extremely viral
[44:15] like one just blowing out of the the
[44:18] shelves and like oh like that's an
[44:21] amazing story and Everyone likes it a
[44:22] lot um but I do do think we need those
[44:26] um
[44:27] really great stories to get through I I
[44:32] don't think we needed it necessarily but
[44:34] I I do think we get it uh over the long
[44:36] run where we actually get to see all
[44:39] those amazing stories written on those
[44:41] great textbooks and where getting really
[44:44] flooded over the masses um so I'm I'm
[44:47] looking forward uh to to those things
[44:50] and we already kind of have them like
[44:52] the the Bitcoin standard and uh let's
[44:55] see where where the book from Larry now
[44:57] goes with with the big print uh and I
[45:00] think he has a lot of does have a lot of
[45:03] potential to to to hit a mainstream and
[45:06] hit some other um interest but
[45:09] mainstream maybe in the finance
[45:12] space which maybe is also um the most
[45:16] important for for Bitcoin because I
[45:18] think like mainstream adoption probably
[45:20] comes from people use it without even
[45:22] knowing a similar way of people use the
[45:25] tcpip protocol without even knowing what
[45:28] what the hack that is uh they use a car
[45:32] without really knowing what an engine is
[45:34] or like how to describe the engine and
[45:36] stuff like that
[45:38] so maybe that's
[45:40] also maybe we don't even need to um
[45:44] educate people on bitcoin more like make
[45:46] them aware of it and and make them
[45:49] comfortable with with Bitcoin and and
[45:51] the applications on top of it and the
[45:53] ecosystem and the implications from that
[45:56] I mean it's so many different things we
[45:58] haven't even talked about like you said
[46:00] um you know spreading through making it
[46:05] easy make it possible and there's a lot
[46:08] of great work in a tech world where
[46:10] people and companies are building apps
[46:12] and solutions and platforms
[46:14] which remove the the barriers that have
[46:17] been that have been put up um but you
[46:21] know I I think we're at what 5 6%
[46:25] adoption or where the internet was was
[46:27] in 1999
[46:29] 2000 there were still people back then
[46:32] saying why do I need the Internet you
[46:35] know people there are still people who
[46:38] even now like very few but are still
[46:42] sort of refusing to get on board with
[46:43] the digital world so I guess if you
[46:47] track that it's going to be another 20
[46:49] 25 years until we're the point of almost
[46:51] total coverage um and everybody needs to
[46:55] keep spreading their or or spreading the
[46:59] news but but putting in their their work
[47:02] to to make it happen be it in the world
[47:05] of development in the world of Finance
[47:08] in the world of media in the world of
[47:10] content creation or stories or whatever
[47:13] it is I think there's there's a lot of
[47:15] different different angles to it um I I
[47:18] just hope that you know what I do
[47:20] is allowing people to spread a story
[47:24] rather than
[47:25] spread Bitcoin and that may be the seed
[47:28] of an idea but but it if it takes root
[47:31] then then it can
[47:33] um you know um really Help
[47:37] The Help Humanity to uh to heal and get
[47:40] better absolutely yeah super interesting
[47:44] how has um we talked about it before and
[47:47] I'm really curious about that uh because
[47:48] we talked about social media and the
[47:50] implications for for offers but how is
[47:52] in general in the last like 10 15 years
[47:56] 20 years is however long you want to go
[47:58] back writing books and being an author
[48:01] have changed uh over the years I mean
[48:05] huge changes and I think there are
[48:07] people who are not able to keep Pace
[48:11] with the change and change is getting
[48:12] faster so you know if you look back to
[48:16] the
[48:17] 1990s very few people were getting
[48:19] published very few people were were
[48:22] article writers in magazines or were
[48:24] publishing books because there was hard
[48:27] line of Gatekeepers the Publishers like
[48:29] penguin random house or haset who were
[48:32] saying yes to you and no to you and
[48:35] that's also why we weren't getting a
[48:38] very
[48:39] diverse uh set of of works right we were
[48:44] getting them saying well people like you
[48:47] know these kinds of stories from these
[48:48] kinds of people so we'll keep putting
[48:50] them out with self-publishing and and
[48:52] the internet that led to opening of the
[48:55] gates you know anyone could publish uh
[48:58] there's a good and a bad to that what's
[49:00] great is we did get a lot of new ideas
[49:03] which are maybe non- mainstream ideas or
[49:05] from people who didn't have a voice
[49:08] before um but we also get millions and
[49:12] millions of books many of them which are
[49:14] crap many of them which will never sell
[49:16] a
[49:16] copy um and authors had to to navigate
[49:20] that I think now self-publishing is is
[49:23] um is accepted as totally normal it's
[49:26] the best option for many people uh you
[49:30] know Larry leard self published his book
[49:33] or published it vi vi Amazon he doesn't
[49:35] need you know the backing of a major
[49:38] publisher because he's built his
[49:39] audience so I think that's um through
[49:43] his years of work in in finance I should
[49:45] say and his um you know and his media
[49:48] presence so I guess that's that's a big
[49:50] change you know learning about
[49:51] self-publishing that becoming accepted
[49:53] learning that you have to build an
[49:55] audience in order to to set to sell
[49:58] books or to to sell your writing um and
[50:01] then the next gracious change of course
[50:03] a few years ago was was Ai and what that
[50:05] means for for writers so I think that
[50:08] it's a very fast
[50:11] changing
[50:12] landscape
[50:14] um there are there are a lot of pluses
[50:18] and minuses I think it's it's hard to
[50:21] earn a living as a writer it's hard to
[50:24] to sell books uh it's hard to
[50:27] you know to to find um maybe a great
[50:31] writing job if you want money it's
[50:34] probably better um professions to go
[50:37] into but that said I think human writing
[50:41] is something that I value a lot and I I
[50:44] really stake my reputation on writing
[50:47] for humans essentially it doesn't matter
[50:50] who writes but you know if a machine can
[50:52] write something which is valuable by
[50:53] humans great um but
[50:57] I think that human writers such as
[51:00] myself should focus on the kinds of
[51:02] texts that only we can produce personal
[51:06] opinion experience stories things like
[51:08] that which machines are not very good
[51:10] at um so that's that's been a great
[51:14] change which we have to navigate but I I
[51:16] believe that human writing will will
[51:19] continue I believe that books will
[51:21] continue to be incredibly important and
[51:23] I think Bitcoin is such a fantastic
[51:25] example of like Niche um publishing
[51:29] industry with so many books bitcoiners
[51:32] read so many books and that's that's
[51:35] most people don't so that's great um but
[51:38] yeah I think books will continue to be
[51:40] important and um they express ideas
[51:42] really perfectly and stories really well
[51:44] so I think you know we we won't see the
[51:47] demise of of the concept of the book uh
[51:51] it may change a bit and we might be
[51:53] doing more multimedia stuff but yeah
[51:56] sorry to on but as uh you know in terms
[51:59] of writing we've seen lots of changes
[52:01] and and there's going to be more but you
[52:03] know writing and human writing would
[52:05] always be yeah what do you feel like is
[52:07] the you imagined a little bit the AI
[52:10] influence of that and and and the human
[52:13] should focus on on on human stories but
[52:16] I think like for for textbooks uh yeah
[52:18] it's probably already very good uh I I
[52:22] not tried it yet uh I'm I asked actually
[52:25] like um that's how I uh came to some
[52:28] some articles ideas and things like that
[52:30] I put all the transcripts of my podcast
[52:32] into chat gbd and just asking hey like
[52:34] what what are interesting topics what
[52:36] are like directions of Articles and what
[52:39] are kind of the key learnings from the
[52:40] podcast because it's just impossible for
[52:43] a human brain to watch 400 podcasts and
[52:46] process that uh but it's possible for
[52:49] eii um and there was so much text and so
[52:54] many great lines coming out and I was
[52:55] like wow that's really that that's
[52:57] written well because eii uses the how
[53:01] the speaker of the
[53:03] podcast uh spoke that and and and and
[53:06] just like used those sentences and and
[53:09] phrase it really well and I'm like oh
[53:11] that's that could be if I put a lot of
[53:14] effort in there in with with eii and and
[53:17] kind of craft it probably I can can
[53:19] write a textbook around Bitcoin with
[53:21] with the help of like 400 transcripts of
[53:24] 400 different Bitcoin things I'm like oh
[53:27] like this this completely changes how
[53:30] how we think about content in general
[53:32] it's not only books because like it will
[53:34] only be a matter of time there I could
[53:37] only be a AI character and and you
[53:40] probably don't even know who's the real
[53:42] Robin and who's the AI Robin um we are
[53:47] we're coming closer to that but right
[53:49] now it's still kind of yeah you can tell
[53:51] which one is the video If you put the
[53:53] original the other one next to each
[53:55] other but it gets closer GLA yeah things
[53:58] are things are changing and you know
[53:59] this may age badly saying oh AI will
[54:02] never be able to write a good novel you
[54:04] know of course it will improve I think a
[54:07] lot of the focus in the last couple of
[54:10] years has been people being impressed
[54:12] about what it can do because it has a
[54:14] computing power and a brain so far ahead
[54:17] of humans it is impressive um but in
[54:20] terms of the value that you bring to the
[54:22] table as a writer or a creator AI would
[54:26] be pretty impressed about the stuff you
[54:28] can do that it can't and it's a machine
[54:31] right that you feed things into it it
[54:34] does its work and it puts something else
[54:36] out which is a product of everything
[54:38] that's gone in and humans can create
[54:40] things where there has been no input and
[54:43] I think that's the impressive thing um
[54:46] there's been certainly no digital input
[54:49] so you know in my in my work if I'm
[54:51] writing a uh uh writing about a business
[54:56] experience for a for a
[54:58] Founder um you know I can tell their
[55:02] story based on like uh what they've told
[55:05] me what I can glean from from the
[55:09] information the little information
[55:11] that's
[55:12] available but it can
[55:15] be some kind of narrative or lesson can
[55:18] be created out of what is not there and
[55:22] I think machines can't do that they are
[55:25] great at passing huge amounts of
[55:26] information and and regurgitating it in
[55:30] a clearer way um you know with your idea
[55:34] about a book it would you'd certainly
[55:37] get something which is um manageable and
[55:41] useful um in terms of writing the best
[55:46] book it would be finding the creative
[55:50] mechanic which Sparks people's interests
[55:53] you know things like the term the big
[55:56] print is is a great example of a a title
[56:01] with a hook and it relies on people's
[56:04] knowledge of things like the big short
[56:07] and uh you know films and Other Stories
[56:09] have happened um I think that's a good
[56:12] way of like humans can
[56:14] frame experiences and um and and data in
[56:19] a way that other humans care about and
[56:21] other humans are interested in machines
[56:23] can can maybe learn that over time but
[56:26] um you know we'll always want nuance and
[56:29] and difference and change again going
[56:32] back to language if you look at how
[56:33] language changes it's counterculture and
[56:36] the one thing AI cannot do is
[56:38] counterculture it can only do mainstream
[56:40] culture because it says all of the stuff
[56:43] that's been put in this is the most
[56:44] common this is the most frequent this is
[56:46] the most accepted this is the most
[56:48] verifiable I'm going to go with that but
[56:51] you know it can never create something
[56:52] which is
[56:53] um edgy or like thinking outside the box
[56:57] that's interesting Al I kind of think
[57:00] mean I'm really just like thinking out
[57:02] loud but it probably will do the same
[57:05] thing as a printing press and social
[57:06] media has done uh it it will probably
[57:09] enable a lot more writing and in a
[57:12] bigger flow of
[57:14] information um but there's this there's
[57:18] this um saying in in in marketing and
[57:22] also like in selling is like humans want
[57:24] to buy from humans uh and and I think
[57:27] humans want to love humans human wants
[57:28] to hear something from other humans um
[57:32] so I I I do think um AI will be highly
[57:38] integrated in in in especially in
[57:41] textbooks I don't know maybe even like
[57:44] in story books uh but at the end of the
[57:46] day it's probably the uniqueness that a
[57:49] human can give the the Special Special
[57:52] Touch on top of it uh but it's it's it's
[57:55] really interesting to think about what
[57:57] EI because we are just in the at the
[58:00] real starting point of of of that EI
[58:03] thing of like it's it's like the the
[58:05] first five years of social media um uh
[58:08] like the I don't know like 2012 on
[58:11] YouTube uh when did YouTube come out
[58:14] like 20108 or something like that uh or
[58:16] five even uh so uh that that's super
[58:20] interesting to think about like oh how
[58:21] does this look in 10 years when those
[58:24] exponential growth curves said it
[58:27] I think it's generational as well um you
[58:29] know if you think about smartphones
[58:32] there are people who are sort of 705 now
[58:35] let's say um who never accepted a
[58:39] smartphone that it would came just too
[58:41] late for them and they thought I've got
[58:43] 10 20 years of life left I'm not going
[58:45] to bother learning it and they never
[58:47] accept that you know everyone around the
[58:50] dinner table is looking at their phone
[58:51] and interacting like they just think
[58:53] that's that's totally unacceptable
[58:57] um and they've never accepted it but
[58:59] kids who were born now get a smartphone
[59:02] when they're 8 years old or whatever and
[59:04] that's totally the norm for their whole
[59:06] life so they accept it I think the same
[59:08] will happen with AI like for me I will
[59:11] never accept Machine written stories
[59:13] they won't be meaningful to me when I
[59:16] read a story I'm
[59:19] connecting not only with the characters
[59:21] and other readers but with the author
[59:23] and the writer whose experience shaped
[59:25] it um you know maybe in 50 years or
[59:28] maybe even in 20 years people kids who
[59:31] grew up with with AI will will um be
[59:34] happy to
[59:35] consume go to the movies and watch a a
[59:38] movie that was written by AI acted by Ai
[59:41] and and directed by Ai and um and it
[59:44] would just be the not that's quite
[59:46] that's quite possible but I think for
[59:48] Millennials and and gen xers and and
[59:52] Boomers we'll never get there maybe the
[59:55] next generation
[59:57] will
[59:58] interesting um maybe a a selfish
[60:03] question if I were to write a book what
[60:07] kind of um tips you have as you also
[60:10] have a channel around that um what kind
[60:12] of tips do you have for me um as someone
[60:16] that is actually non English speaking
[60:18] but I do a lot of like most of my time
[60:20] now I speak English it almost feels like
[60:22] I'm native but with a weird accent um
[60:26] and I never written and as as you know
[60:29] from the thing I told you before I was
[60:31] actually failing English and German
[60:33] classes I was never good in writing
[60:35] anything I suppose it depends on your
[60:37] time preference if your objective is to
[60:39] really you know improve your English and
[60:42] and your writing to a level where it's
[60:45] it's you know very high level accepted
[60:49] very proficient level of language than
[60:51] different forms of study working with
[60:54] colleagues coaches tutors
[60:56] um editors will and being part of a
[60:59] community as well will usually help you
[61:02] work towards like a long-term goal like
[61:05] that um as with a book I think many
[61:09] people want to have a book because it
[61:11] sort of is a representation of of their
[61:15] personality and and work and and ideas
[61:19] uh that's great I think it's it's
[61:21] totally valid in terms of writing a book
[61:26] uh you need to do it be doing it for
[61:29] yourself you need to love the process
[61:31] and you want to write that book for
[61:33] yourself you want it to include the
[61:35] things that that um that Express who you
[61:40] are um but you also need to bear in mind
[61:43] you're not the consumer of the book
[61:45] hopefully other people are um so you
[61:49] also need to bear in mind that people
[61:51] reading the book need to get something
[61:52] from it and that if it's a book that you
[61:55] want to sell publish um or you know get
[61:58] out into the world then it's a product
[62:00] at the end of the day so we go back to
[62:03] bitcoin books if you write a book about
[62:05] this is what I think about Bitcoin well
[62:07] okay but you know how many of those
[62:08] books have we have we had um so my
[62:12] advice for any writers in a Bitcoin
[62:15] space who are putting out um books or um
[62:20] think about longer form writing is is um
[62:24] do it for yourself but also consider
[62:27] that you're writing is a product and it
[62:31] needs to be something nuanced different
[62:34] new um and exciting to people you have
[62:38] to to sell what you're doing I think
[62:41] that's another big change in in writing
[62:43] now is that like you spend a lot of time
[62:46] selling even if it's just your own
[62:48] writing you're selling it you know
[62:49] rather than just yeah Earnest hemway
[62:52] could drink four glasses of rum and sit
[62:55] down his typewriter and do whatever they
[62:57] hairly wanted and his publisher would
[62:59] eventually say have you got a
[63:01] manuscript I think now you've got
[63:03] to plan things and and execute um in
[63:07] terms of the the production and and the
[63:09] selling of of your
[63:11] writing yeah that's interesting and like
[63:14] what I will 100% do is um just write it
[63:18] for myself uh uh because I think that's
[63:21] really valuable even uh if I just look
[63:23] at like figuring out what I'm thinking
[63:26] about Bitcoin and and where my thoughts
[63:28] are even I even asked Larry y yesterday
[63:31] the question of like how did uh writing
[63:35] the book influence your thinking of
[63:36] Bitcoin and he mentioned some things
[63:38] that actually um profound it his view on
[63:42] on on bitcoin just with the process of
[63:44] writing because then you were like oh I
[63:46] actually have that small topic inside
[63:48] there I have to research I have to
[63:50] actually look up because I I always took
[63:52] it as a given but now I'm writing it
[63:54] down I want to put it out in the world
[63:56] now really have to study that thing in
[63:58] detail uh and so that's just a process
[64:01] that I definitely want maybe I'm just uh
[64:04] making a PDF and say like oh like if you
[64:06] want to read it here it
[64:08] is but uh I have to the point right now
[64:13] because I know it's a lot of work uh and
[64:16] uh right now no no intentions of selling
[64:20] and Publishing a book uh because I think
[64:22] it's it's it is a lot of planning and
[64:24] selling um but I definitely will uh
[64:28] craft my thoughts better with with
[64:29] writing the book and if there's
[64:31] something out there where I'm like okay
[64:33] I could put those thoughts that are
[64:35] written down maybe in something nice
[64:38] that people actually value and people
[64:39] actually have an advantage of maybe then
[64:42] I go ahead
[64:43] but don't expect anything this year
[64:46] there are so many different forms of
[64:47] publishing I mean we're quite focused on
[64:49] books in in Bitcoin because complex
[64:52] ideas often need that that you know
[64:55] wraparound um concept of of a book but
[64:58] there are so many great ways to to
[65:00] publish you know on like a sort of
[65:02] newsletter style like sstack those kind
[65:05] of Publications as you say like PDFs
[65:07] guides You Know audio books podcasts
[65:10] just animations there's so many
[65:13] different ways that you can express that
[65:15] or even just I think a lot of the
[65:17] Bitcoin Community is moving towards like
[65:19] micro blogging you know like meaningful
[65:22] decent posts on X or nosta um are
[65:26] something which is especially with nsta
[65:29] is like a proof of work and will be
[65:31] there for for a long time and can
[65:33] actually ACR value so a couple of
[65:36] questions before getting into book
[65:37] writing as well is like does this need
[65:39] to be a book would this be best
[65:41] expressed as a book and the second
[65:43] question would be like why should people
[65:44] care about this if you can't answer
[65:47] those questions very um easily then then
[65:51] maybe you need to think about um other
[65:54] other options it's an
[65:56] does it need to be a book yeah maybe
[65:58] it's maybe it's also like a sequence of
[66:01] articles that you that you can just put
[66:04] out like you don't have to put it in a
[66:05] book yeah or like even um you can
[66:09] express the same thoughts in a book that
[66:11] that you can also do maybe like in a in
[66:13] a one hour video and just like sitting
[66:15] down and and and expressing uh what you
[66:18] think about that and just like talking
[66:20] about it one hour long if if you are
[66:22] more comfortable like me in front of the
[66:24] camera as in front of a
[66:26] pen I am really I I run I run into so
[66:31] many people who who say oh oh you're
[66:33] wrer I'm writing a book or oh I want to
[66:35] write a book and I say okay great what's
[66:38] it about and they say me my life I've
[66:41] had a crazy life or I've had an
[66:43] interesting life if if you ask those two
[66:46] questions to those people does it need
[66:49] to be a book they say probably not well
[66:52] why is it book because I want a book
[66:54] because I want it to be you know book so
[66:56] in a way it's um you know that um
[67:01] self-importance of social media we all
[67:03] want that um you know to show that we
[67:06] we're important and doing well and you
[67:09] know if you ask them why would anybody
[67:10] care that say well they probably
[67:12] wouldn't so you know why are you doing
[67:15] it then that that's what what I would
[67:17] say I should say as well that there a
[67:19] loads of people who have had amazing
[67:21] lives that that are worthy of writing
[67:23] books in fact anyone's life is worthy of
[67:26] writing a book but if you can't answer
[67:28] that question of like why people would
[67:30] care you haven't framed it in a way
[67:32] which is um valuable enough for people
[67:35] to consume it as a as a product
[67:38] essentially so that's um some of the the
[67:41] thought process that you need to go to
[67:43] to to figure out if you're if you're
[67:45] going to write a book or not yeah and
[67:48] then you that's the hard hard truth
[67:51] always about the free market then
[67:53] because like you value it and you think
[67:55] it's very valuable for for the people
[67:57] and especially as a content creator I
[67:58] know that a lot sometimes you're like oh
[68:00] that podcast episode is really good and
[68:02] you put it out there and yeah the
[68:04] average food duration is down people
[68:05] don't click on the title like people
[68:08] don't leave nice comments and you're
[68:09] like okay I was the only one that
[68:12] thought that that episode was really
[68:14] special uh and and sometimes you go
[68:17] through the through that theory of like
[68:19] there is content that you like it
[68:21] doesn't mean that Everyone likes that
[68:24] content uh uh and uh it's it's okay to
[68:29] like if you put out consistent content
[68:32] no matter it's if it's writing a book
[68:35] writing book is is is probably way more
[68:37] hard than like like just having an X
[68:39] account or like having a podcast or
[68:41] having like some video Channel or
[68:43] Instagram stories or whatever if you put
[68:45] it out consistently for a long period of
[68:47] time and nobody fuse it nobody interacts
[68:51] with that it's probably because it sucks
[68:54] and that's the it's the hard truth but
[68:57] you might still want to do it because
[68:59] maybe that's what you really enjoy and
[69:02] and it's like almost maybe therapy for
[69:03] yourself and maybe it's it's important
[69:05] for you or maybe it's it's important for
[69:07] some other aspect of your life without
[69:09] getting recognized or getting someone to
[69:13] to buy a book or something like that so
[69:15] like content can can be very very nice
[69:19] without having the business business
[69:21] case of that yeah that's that's are many
[69:25] people who write for themselves and just
[69:28] write because it's a great you know
[69:30] expression that's that's something we
[69:31] haven't talked about and it's very true
[69:33] I definitely encourage people to write
[69:35] and to journal and to write their own
[69:36] thoughts and and get things down it's
[69:38] it's very helpful um but going back to
[69:41] what you said about yeah whether content
[69:43] does well or not well there's quality
[69:45] and quantity you know if you said to me
[69:47] Phil this was a very special episode of
[69:49] of my podcast and it really meant a lot
[69:51] to me that would be great that would be
[69:53] you know better for me than getting
[69:55] million views um but you know you also
[69:57] measure on terms of quantity as well
[70:00] right so you want to um you know see
[70:02] those metrics and and assess like how
[70:04] things are doing well for me that might
[70:06] be how much I get paid or whether a book
[70:08] sells or or not but um I think you have
[70:12] to balance both because we do set
[70:14] ourselves up to to fail in a very in a
[70:17] world which is difficult to Market stuff
[70:20] because everyone else is trying and a
[70:22] free market as you say things can um Can
[70:26] bomb for many reasons so respect the the
[70:29] quality of feedback that you get as well
[70:32] as um numerical quantitative and and
[70:35] that the the the quantity doesn't
[70:39] necessarily say something about the
[70:40] quality but uh it it does has the aspect
[70:43] of like if people really resonate with
[70:46] an episode they are more likely to like
[70:49] send it to friends and send it around
[70:51] and and make the podcast episode bigger
[70:53] than than than Maybe usual there's also
[70:57] like how this algorithms usually work is
[70:59] like they they see if if when they see
[71:04] the content do they interact with it and
[71:06] how long do they interact with that
[71:08] that's like if I have to describe all
[71:11] the algorithms out there in one sentence
[71:13] that's basically the the formula like
[71:15] what do they do with the uh content when
[71:18] they when they see it and how long do do
[71:20] they do it with uh in in YouTube terms
[71:23] for example do they click on the the
[71:25] thumbnail and how long do they watch the
[71:27] the whole thing then and this determines
[71:30] 90% of your success of of of an episode
[71:35] uh and then like 10% of like sharing in
[71:37] other metrics it it it does represent
[71:41] the quantity does represent to some
[71:43] extent uh quality but not always because
[71:46] there also things like um who who who
[71:51] was in the in in in the thumbnail who
[71:53] who was in in the podcast because he's
[71:54] really famous was but he had a bad day
[71:56] and the podcast was actually really bad
[71:58] so like it still got a lot of views
[72:00] because I don't know like e musk was in
[72:02] there or something like that but uh it
[72:04] was actually not that valuable or was
[72:06] there someone that was completely
[72:08] unknown nobody knew him at all this was
[72:10] his first podcast but for some reason he
[72:12] was really good in speaking and he was
[72:14] really great as as a podcast guest and
[72:17] he did not good because nobody knew him
[72:19] and nobody clicked on it in the first
[72:21] place so there are there are there there
[72:23] there are some valuable insights in in
[72:26] the quantity but with a lot of
[72:30] um a lot of perspectives that you have
[72:32] to keep in mind of of the platforms and
[72:36] and the overall ecos system I would say
[72:39] I I could talk way too long about social
[72:41] media in
[72:44] algorithms yeah I'm not an expert on it
[72:47] but I've dabbled in all the social media
[72:50] apart from Tik Tok because that's just
[72:52] evil but
[72:53] um and had my share of algorithm
[72:57] successes failures and burnouts so yeah
[73:00] I could also go on about that for a
[73:02] while but um certainly no YouTube expert
[73:04] like so really cool let's come to the
[73:06] end before the end I have always one
[73:09] question to ask each and every one of my
[73:10] guests and the question is what can we
[73:12] learn from you besides Bitcoin um you

[73:27] being a a language and writing coach for
[73:31] for pro writers um so if you want to

[74:08] touch with me in terms of my Bitcoin
[74:11] writing um visit totally human
[74:14] writer.com
[74:16] really cool thank you so much um we have
[74:19] one more end end routine uh where the
[74:22] previous guest is asking a question for
[74:24] the next guest without knowing who the
[74:26] next guest actually is and the question
[74:29] for you completely different topic now
[74:32] but that's that's the beauty of that end
[74:34] routine it it brings something new in
[74:36] the in the podcast how long do you think
[74:39] it will take till the European Union
[74:41] disintegrates and maybe before the
[74:43] question should be do you even think
[74:45] that the EU will will fail I mean
[74:47] everything will will come to an end
[74:49] eventually right including the the
[74:50] planet but
[74:52] um the EU I'd say um in the
[74:58] next 20 to 30 years I would expect it to
[75:04] look different I can't tell you exactly
[75:07] how but I think um changes in
[75:09] geopolitics and monetary systems will
[75:12] have a massive part to play in uh
[75:16] the changing nature of the nation state
[75:20] so uh I I do think it will be smashed
[75:24] apart in the next 20 to 30 years W
[75:27] really interesting perfect then thank
[75:29] you so much uh uh Philip for for being
[75:32] on on the show I usually asked where
