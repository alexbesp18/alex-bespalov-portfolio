[00:00] understand you right that you said 99%
[00:01] of world's energy will be in Bitcoin
[00:04] mining at some point 99% of our energy
[00:07] production will be for Bitcoin if we
[00:09] want future in space Bitcoin is actually
[00:12] inevitable 9,000 KW hours per person and
[00:15] we've been at this level for the last 50
[00:17] years the last 50 years basically the
[00:19] energy consumption per person has stayed
[00:22] the same as it was 50 years Humanity has
[00:25] not actually progressed in terms of
[00:27] energy production at all at some point
[00:29] we might en Circle the sun with solar
[00:31] panels and this will be uh around the
[00:34] orbit of mercury so all the all the
[00:37] Bitcoin mining will happen there and you
[00:39] could buy a Tesla for one Bitcoin now
[00:42] you buy a car then you will buy a house
[00:44] and at some point it will buy you a
[00:46] large space station with uh millions of
[00:48] of square miles of space What will be
[00:51] the Tipping Point for Bitcoin Mass
[00:56] adoption so um to introduce myself I
[01:01] started actually last year on
[01:04] Instagram um when this whole CH GPT uh
[01:08] mid Journey thing kicked off you know uh
[01:12] I always was interested in science
[01:14] fiction and writing in
[01:17] general and I had this just very
[01:19] abstract idea of um what happens if one
[01:26] day uh many hundreds of years in the
[01:28] future um humans are gone and they're
[01:32] only rats and they pick up the pieces
[01:35] you know of their of the humans and they
[01:39] slowly discover the the world Humanity
[01:42] has left
[01:43] behind and um yeah so in this in this
[01:48] world there we have colonized
[01:51] space and we're still using the time
[01:55] chain to um trade to agree on things to
[02:00] have a legal
[02:02] system and yeah I started publishing
[02:06] short stories I still don't know where I
[02:09] want to go with this um this year I
[02:12] started on X um also interacting uh
[02:16] primarily because I also wanted to get a
[02:17] bit into the mind of of
[02:20] bitcoiners um because as I as I did the
[02:23] research for these stories I figured out
[02:28] if we want uh future in space Bitcoin is
[02:32] actually
[02:34] inevitable and um so we
[02:38] had a space race in the 60s in the 70s
[02:42] and it all looked like um this will go
[02:46] on a on a straight trajectory we will go
[02:49] to Mars by the 2000s have a presence on
[02:52] the moon in the in the 80s right that's
[02:55] what everyone thought back then and um
[03:00] this dream didn't pan out and um maybe
[03:04] it's because of the Fiat system because
[03:07] um if you don't have a hard
[03:10] money
[03:12] your your narrative needs to be you need
[03:16] to save
[03:17] energy because there's um all the
[03:22] incentives are aligned that your your
[03:25] your money loses purchasing power
[03:27] constantly you cannot save so what do
[03:29] you need to do you need to um limit your
[03:34] expenditures and if you I don't know if
[03:36] you know the chart from uh what the [ __ ]
[03:39] happens in
[03:41] 1971 there is this very interesting
[03:44] chart about the energy consumption and
[03:47] that has uh stayed static at uh uh 9,000
[03:51] kilowatt hours per person and we've been
[03:54] at this level for the last 50 years so
[03:57] um Humanity has not actually progressed
[04:00] in terms of energy production at
[04:04] all um so how do we get out of this
[04:09] right that's a question and that's
[04:11] really interesting and didn't even knew
[04:13] that I knew the I know the side but I've
[04:15] not uh studied all the charts there so
[04:18] like the last 50 years basically the
[04:20] energy consumption per person has stayed
[04:24] the same as it was 50 years L like it
[04:27] completely exactly right uh I mean one
[04:30] part is that we're getting more
[04:31] efficient we have better
[04:34] technology um but in general you would
[04:36] assume that this uh goes up uh but
[04:39] that's not the case because there is uh
[04:42] no real driving force no economic
[04:44] incentive to uh have more energy
[04:47] consumption per person and yeah if we
[04:51] want to uh explore space we need need a
[04:54] lot more
[04:56] energy and also what's interesting there
[04:59] is also this
[05:01] idea um to put solar panels into orbit
[05:06] right um the problem with that is how do
[05:11] you get the energy uh down to
[05:14] earth and we have a solution now since
[05:19] 2008 um we just mine Bitcoin in
[05:23] space and
[05:25] because you can always exchange Bitcoin
[05:28] for energy right it's a it's a
[05:31] derivative on on energy production it's
[05:34] like in back in the gold standards you
[05:36] had your dollars you could exchange them
[05:39] for gold if you have Bitcoin you can go
[05:43] to a minor and say hey um I want your
[05:45] energy uh turn off your minor so uh you
[05:50] can uh exchange your Bitcoin for energy
[05:54] and so the idea
[05:57] is if we put solar panels in orbit
[06:00] satellites basically uh put miners on
[06:03] them
[06:04] um we
[06:06] can this idea can be economically
[06:10] feasible which is it was not before
[06:12] interesting and yeah do you also think
[06:15] that we we could live like an an an
[06:18] energy abundant uh future when when we
[06:21] have Bitcoin when we have some money and
[06:23] like the the financial layer is is is
[06:26] sound yeah definitely so it all
[06:29] interestingly it all it all uh uh ties
[06:33] together right the um let's imagine the
[06:37] the hash rate has actually doubled every
[06:39] year since bitcoin's Inception and we
[06:42] are right now at uh I think it's below
[06:46] 1% of the world's energy production is
[06:49] in
[06:50] Bitcoin and if this trend
[06:53] continues at some point uh 99% of our
[06:58] energy production will be for Bitcoin
[07:01] and all our human needs will
[07:04] be uh basically the waste the wasted
[07:08] energy yeah I published this this this
[07:12] expost where I I looked at okay what
[07:16] would happen if uh this hash rate will
[07:20] double for the next 100
[07:23] years
[07:25] and first we will um eat more and more
[07:30] of the Earth's energy production we
[07:33] currently have right and then miners
[07:36] will need to go in themselves into the
[07:38] energy producing business because they
[07:41] both from political uh forces and also
[07:45] economic forces uh they can take our
[07:47] energy so they we need to raise our
[07:50] energy production to meet bitcoin's
[07:52] demand at some point because right now
[07:54] it's more or less stranded energy miners
[07:57] are using the the stranded energy um
[07:59] we're not building power plants to
[08:01] exclusively mine Bitcoin right now there
[08:04] are some old power plants I think that
[08:06] are
[08:07] used but in general it's not like hey um
[08:12] let's build this uh huge solar farms uh
[08:16] to to exclusively mind Bitcoin right
[08:18] it's more of an afterthought or to use
[08:21] the stranded
[08:23] energy um for me it's it's interesting
[08:26] when you say like 99% of the world's
[08:28] energy will be for did I understand you
[08:30] right that you said 99% of world's
[08:32] energy will be in Bitcoin mining yes
[08:36] it's interesting probably happen sooner
[08:38] than we think um because um we're now at
[08:44] 1% and if it doubles every year right
[08:50] in in in in six years where we we we
[08:54] would be there
[08:55] already if this trend continues of
[08:57] course but but um that are a lot of
[09:01] questions in my mind now because uh one
[09:03] is like like I deal now and maybe I'm
[09:06] wrong till now thought Bitcoin mining
[09:09] will have a long way to go up like we
[09:12] have a long way till till we reach like
[09:14] a certain amount and then we will not
[09:17] expand the hash rate too much uh uh with
[09:21] every year I always thought it will
[09:23] always go up as the world and as the
[09:27] power grows but I didn't thought that it
[09:29] go that much up but I never thought
[09:31] about it like how how many of the
[09:33] world's energy it would actually um
[09:36] consume so I never thought about that so
[09:39] forgive me for not being that much
[09:41] educated on that um but my thought in my
[09:45] head right now is we have a base layer
[09:48] constraint and I talked with we we
[09:49] talked before we recorded about Wicket
[09:51] really quick uh and Wicket has the
[09:54] opinion that because of utxo management
[09:56] because of constraints of the base layer
[09:58] they will be a maximum of like 5 to 10
[10:02] million institutions or individuals that
[10:05] be will be able to uh interchange their
[10:08] Bitcoin on the base layer um and then I
[10:12] also talked with with saor uh just a few
[10:15] a few days ago and he also said the
[10:17] average
[10:18] transaction um um uh average transaction
[10:23] on the base layer measured in fear terms
[10:26] of course uh will go up crazy like now
[10:29] now it's like whatever like 200 or 20
[10:32] euros uh and then we have like soon like
[10:35] 2,000 then 20,000 then maybe some
[10:38] someday 2 million as an average
[10:40] transaction uh in fear terms on the base
[10:43] layer um will will the base layer just
[10:47] just be like a like I thought that the
[10:50] base layer will be a settlement layer
[10:52] for really big and important
[10:54] transactions so not used on a daily
[10:57] basis and therefore not always
[10:59] expanding in Infinity till like the 99%
[11:03] that you just said the energy
[11:05] consumption or so like am I wrong here
[11:08] so a few thoughts on that in in my
[11:12] stories um Bitcoin or as we call it the
[11:16] time
[11:17] chain is used also
[11:20] to uh secure the the spacecraft
[11:25] movements so you uh on a on a on a solar
[11:31] system scale right you need to
[11:33] synchronize spacecraft movements and you
[11:37] have issues like what what comes first
[11:41] right what is now you don't know what
[11:43] now is there is no objective now right
[11:47] um so if if you want to synchronize uh
[11:50] orbital movements on a grander scale uh
[11:53] you need a very secure layer a layer
[11:56] where we have Universal
[11:58] consensus and where we can s to say
[12:01] inscribe um our objective reality into
[12:05] and um of course that will be very
[12:08] expensive because there's a lot of value
[12:11] in it um that let's say countries um or
[12:16] at some point even planets uh orbital
[12:19] settlements can do
[12:22] settlement of their
[12:24] financial um structures of their
[12:27] economic uh state
[12:29] of their legal system at some
[12:31] point and um at this scale this uh block
[12:37] size limit actually becomes a feature
[12:40] because you have a limited band within
[12:43] space you have this inverse Square law
[12:45] so the the energy uh goes up
[12:48] exponentially the further the distance
[12:51] so I have this block size limit is
[12:54] actually a feature because uh we have a
[12:56] bandwidth constraint
[12:59] and uh why would you break want to break
[13:01] this um this important
[13:04] feature you can always have second
[13:06] layers right for your local for your
[13:08] local uh economies right let's say a
[13:12] country a planet does local Commerce uh
[13:16] at some point you wouldn't do that on
[13:17] the base layer you would do only the
[13:20] things that you need to synchronize um
[13:23] between let's say
[13:27] jurisdictions so it's it's so it's even
[13:31] more than than just money it's like a
[13:33] Time chain where you can actually secure
[13:35] stuff on there and that's why there are
[13:37] so much valuable let's just call it to
[13:41] to use a simple term stuff on on the
[13:43] Bitcoin main chain with all this layer
[13:45] two and layer three um technologies that
[13:49] it actually makes sense then it's like
[13:52] big percentage of the world's energy is
[13:54] in there it's really interesting I have
[13:55] to um really dive deep in this how much
[13:58] of the percentage of the world's energy
[14:00] will Bitcoin Min like I I never looked
[14:03] it up I'm
[14:05] embarrassed yeah so the other the other
[14:07] reason why it it might go up as it has
[14:12] been right it doubles every year so
[14:15] every year new miners basically try to
[14:17] do a 50% attack so you have the existing
[14:21] miners they have their machines right
[14:23] and every year the same amount of
[14:26] machines comes
[14:27] online so so it's it's it's it's
[14:30] basically a game theory uh conundrum
[14:34] that uh this this 50% attack happens
[14:37] every year by by new Miners and also
[14:39] existing miners need to step up you know
[14:42] or their their business will will fail
[14:45] so I also see this game theoretical
[14:48] incentive to double the mining uh hash
[14:51] rate every
[14:53] year and um it's not that that like um
[14:58] the percentage uh has to go straight up
[15:01] because at some point as said the miners
[15:04] will
[15:05] also uh build their own power
[15:08] plants um at some point it will be very
[15:12] economically uh feasible to uh build the
[15:15] mining rigs in
[15:17] space and that will also Drive
[15:21] development of space of course
[15:24] because uh you have the mining
[15:26] satellites there you need to build the
[15:28] infrastructure
[15:29] you need to maybe even have people
[15:32] living in space long term to maintain it
[15:36] uh depends how robotics will go but um
[15:39] you know it it it will be uh very
[15:41] economically feasible to do so and we we
[15:46] we have no other technology
[15:48] currently uh maybe besides asteroids
[15:51] mining um that that uh makes sense to do
[15:55] in
[15:56] space so Bitcoin is kind of the first
[15:59] one where it makes sense to do it I also
[16:02] heard and I'm again no expert in this
[16:05] topic unfortunately uh but I heard that
[16:08] uh um block time could
[16:12] be could could be one of the reasons why
[16:15] Bitcoin cannot scale on multiplanetary
[16:18] uh as a multiplanetary currency do we
[16:21] have to change something in the code or
[16:25] is is Bitcoin already ready for like
[16:28] this expansion to to another
[16:31] planet yeah so um there there are many
[16:35] different thoughts on this right um like
[16:38] many different camps on on how this
[16:40] could go because probably there are many
[16:43] different outcomes how this could go um
[16:46] there's the the theory that uh we will
[16:50] have uh competing once we colonize Mars
[16:53] that we will have a competing Bitcoin
[16:55] there right because uh on Mars you can
[16:59] mind Bitcoin because of the light lag um
[17:01] so we might have a a competing Bitcoin
[17:05] on Mars at some point um the problem
[17:07] with that is that um the energy
[17:11] production on Mars is much more
[17:13] expensive because in a in a solar in in
[17:16] a solar powered uh economy the closer
[17:20] you are to the Sun the the more
[17:21] efficient your power panels
[17:23] are um so why would you invest into Mars
[17:29] coin uh if you get more Bitcoin uh in
[17:33] the in the very long term uh for your
[17:36] for your
[17:37] investment right but in the in the short
[17:39] term this could happen that we have a
[17:41] second Bitcoin on
[17:43] Mars um I think very long term it uh
[17:47] will uh if we if we increase on on our
[17:52] development on the CF scale that at some
[17:55] point we might uh encircle the sun with
[17:58] solar panels and this will be uh around
[18:02] the orbit of mercury so all the all the
[18:06] Bitcoin mining will happen there and uh
[18:09] that's still within the 10minute
[18:13] window um where the where the mining can
[18:16] take place and um you can do like you
[18:20] can do Bitcoin transactions over a much
[18:23] longer uh time scale uh so um you can
[18:27] send your transaction signed it doesn't
[18:29] matter uh if it's within that 10minute
[18:32] window right um it's just about the
[18:35] mining where will the mining happen and
[18:38] uh that might long term and we're
[18:41] talking probably 100 years plus um
[18:45] happen happen around Mercury and and we
[18:48] might develop Mercury at this point to
[18:51] to mine
[18:53] Bitcoin like we will literally destroy
[18:55] Mercury turn the whole planet into solar
[18:59] uh just to mine
[19:01] Bitcoin H love but that's when that's
[19:04] when uh we will have in in today's
[19:06] purchasing power we will have $1
[19:08] trillion per Satoshi not per Bitcoin per
[19:11] Satoshi because that's the that's the
[19:13] energy equivalent to that kind of power
[19:16] at this
[19:17] point
[19:19] how do do we have the US dollar at this
[19:23] point like it doesn't even matter to to
[19:25] measure it in in US Dollars and other
[19:27] currencies than than
[19:29] Bitcoin I I don't know right um in in in
[19:35] my stories the currency Nanos which is a
[19:38] nano
[19:39] satosi so uh we probably use lightning
[19:43] Network or something similar uh some
[19:45] layer some layer on top of Bitcoin and
[19:49] uh lightning already has this uh subsi
[19:52] denominations right you can transact
[19:56] fractions of a satosi
[19:59] and it it it doesn't make much sense to
[20:02] me that once we have a a sound money
[20:07] that is tied to to to energy right we
[20:10] had it at some point the the German word
[20:13] for money is what Del no the other one
[20:18] Veron coer coer so at some point we had
[20:23] right we had uh energy based currency uh
[20:27] when when in the in the early stage of
[20:28] the Industrial Revolution we had people
[20:31] used actual coals coal to to to
[20:35] barter um because they were also paid in
[20:38] Coal uh for some time they were just
[20:41] paid in coal and transacted using that
[20:43] and that's where this word came from uh
[20:46] so it doesn't make sense to have a a
[20:50] derivative uh once you have the real
[20:53] thing right why would you delute your
[20:56] measuring capability it's it's like you
[20:59] already have a perfect
[21:00] meter right you already have the metric
[21:03] system and then you build something on
[21:05] top of that to have something that's
[21:09] that's less precise why would you do
[21:10] that J is really interesting uh when we
[21:13] have this uh sci-fi thought where
[21:16] there's multiple planets using Bitcoin
[21:19] not just Earth and Earth probably also
[21:21] expands till then uh so Bitcoin does not
[21:25] expand it's like this 21 million uh
[21:27] limit and probably it's more like 50
[21:29] million uh because things getting lost
[21:32] and stuff like that but then you have
[21:34] like on Earth eight billion people maybe
[21:36] at this point we have like 15 billion
[21:39] people on Earth then we have uh PE
[21:41] people on other planets then we I don't
[21:44] know have maybe even other species
[21:46] rats uh yes probably then it's like um
[21:52] one satoan and one
[21:54] Bitcoin it's it's so hard to grasp what
[21:57] you can buy with that when like one uh
[22:00] unit of that is is is uh has to be
[22:04] spread out between so many people and so
[22:06] many institutions and so many entities
[22:09] it's a it's an interesting thought that
[22:11] that kind of expands your mind that what
[22:13] once aosi can can buy you at one point
[22:17] yeah it will probably buy you uh a a
[22:20] space station uh at some point right uh
[22:25] I always thought my I always said a few
[22:27] years ago
[22:29] uh my retirement plan is to uh buy a
[22:32] spasic Starship with one Bitcoin at some
[22:34] point okay so one because I think at
[22:36] some point that will be the price right
[22:39] um once we go into uh private
[22:42] starships that will happen you know uh
[22:46] uh rich people at some point they they
[22:48] don't want yards or planes if if there
[22:51] is space spaceships uh they will buy
[22:55] those
[22:56] yeah uh probably uh at some point you
[22:59] can buy one for one
[23:01] Bitcoin amazing everything that El musk
[23:05] uh uh buil so so expensively and does
[23:08] for him at some point in the future we
[23:10] can just buy it with one Bitcoin that
[23:13] some people like bought
[23:15] for1 yeah but you know uh I think this
[23:18] was 2021 where you could buy a Tesla for
[23:21] one Bitcoin right that was about the the
[23:24] the
[23:25] amount I think in in 10 or 20 years uh
[23:29] it's not unreasonable to believe if if
[23:31] Bitcoin develops like it did before
[23:34] right uh we don't know that but it looks
[23:37] like it will it it now you buy a car
[23:39] then you will buy a house and at some
[23:42] point you know uh it will it will buy
[23:45] you a large space station with
[23:48] uh millions of of square miles of space
[23:52] you also brought up the concept of of
[23:54] time chain a lot um first of all like
[23:57] for for for people that are a little bit
[23:59] newer here if they don't if they are
[24:03] still here um what what do you think is
[24:06] the concept of time chain like like what
[24:09] what what is like why we Bitcoin are
[24:12] saying so many times like Bitcoin is
[24:15] time and and and Bitcoin is the time
[24:17] chain rather than the
[24:19] blockchain because what um at least from
[24:22] my understanding right I I I could be
[24:25] wrong here uh on the details but uh What
[24:29] uh Bitcoin essentially solves from an
[24:32] engineering standpoint is um consensus
[24:39] about um what happened first because in
[24:43] the real world there is no mechanism to
[24:46] guarantee you have two events that
[24:49] happen you have no guarantee which event
[24:52] happens in which order it's referred I
[24:55] think to this uh three generous problem
[24:57] that's the that's a theoretical
[24:59] framework behind it uh where you you
[25:02] need to
[25:03] synchronize uh knowledge between parties
[25:06] that don't trust each other uh yet they
[25:10] still want to come up with a uh
[25:13] objective Truth uh and that's actually
[25:16] what Bitcoin solves so Bitcoin creates
[25:19] this uh objective truth what was
[25:24] first you have one transaction in block
[25:27] a and uh then in the next block you have
[25:31] another transaction and it's
[25:34] guaranteed um that the order happened
[25:37] like this and it you cannot Shuffle it
[25:39] around right if you use normal clocks
[25:42] right or you use a
[25:44] traditional software you you have a time
[25:48] stamp there but the time stamp is not
[25:50] objective it's your computer's clock and
[25:52] that's always it's always
[25:54] off and Bitcoin is the first technology
[25:57] where we have on a global scale an
[25:59] objective
[26:01] decentralized uh clock
[26:04] basically what do you think are the
[26:07] implications of that like is that
[26:10] changing uh is is that changing the
[26:12] world in a major way
[26:14] um I think we right now we we need
[26:20] trusted parties to uh know which which
[26:25] event came first right we
[26:29] and we also have the luxury of a very
[26:32] fast internet but once you know once we
[26:34] go out into space and light leg becomes
[26:37] an issue right on the moon you have a
[26:39] second uh back and forth it's already a
[26:42] noticable delay uh if you go to Mars
[26:45] you're out five minutes um so you then
[26:49] it becomes really important if you want
[26:51] to do any you know Financial
[26:53] transactions any Ecommerce right you
[26:56] need an objective truth what can came
[26:58] first and so um Bitcoin is one way to
[27:03] guarantee that that's the Innovation
[27:05] basically and we need that uh in the
[27:08] future when we want to be multiplanetary
[27:11] because it's important what came first
[27:14] Ah that's an interesting thought yes yes
[27:16] uh so so my idea was also you have this
[27:19] these Lanes in space where you can use
[27:22] gravity assists to propel your
[27:23] spacecraft for um much cheaper costs
[27:27] right you don't need that much much
[27:29] Rocket
[27:30] Fuel
[27:32] So to avoid collisions to basically
[27:35] reserve your
[27:37] slot um you inscribe that on the time
[27:41] chain and uh in that way it's it's you
[27:45] have an objective reservation of your of
[27:47] your journey
[27:49] basically yeah if you have many uh many
[27:52] planets that not necessarily agree uh
[27:56] they they can opt to agree on on this
[27:59] one Bitcoin standard and and this
[28:01] problem is solved for them at least I
[28:04] mean they still all need to say we we
[28:06] want to use Bitcoin of course right if
[28:08] they're everyone is using a competing
[28:10] system uh it's it's still a problem but
[28:13] uh we can delegate this consensus to
[28:16] this one layer that solve this issue
[28:18] solves this issue for us so um it
[28:21] doesn't only solve money it solves all
[28:23] synchronization problems we
[28:25] have and you also wrote about the I
[28:28] never can pronounce it the K KF scale uh
[28:35] the this also play in that that we are
[28:37] moving on in the scale up to a type one
[28:41] uh civilization maybe for those who are
[28:43] not familiar with it like what is that
[28:45] scale and and and how does it apply with
[28:47] Bitcoin so the the colip scale was
[28:50] developed in the in the 60s by Russian
[28:52] astronomer Nikolai
[28:54] Kev and uh his idea was basically that
[28:58] uh solar power is the most efficient
[29:00] form of energy because we have this huge
[29:03] Fusion reactor in the sky and
[29:07] uh even if we Master Fusion ourselves on
[29:11] earth right uh the sun is still more
[29:13] efficient so the the his idea was the
[29:17] measure of a civilization is how much of
[29:20] the sun's
[29:21] output uh is the civilization
[29:25] using right now um we at level
[29:30] 0.7 where level one is we use all the
[29:33] sunlight that gets hit by
[29:36] Earth which is um a 10 billionth of the
[29:41] total Sun output so
[29:45] we're 10 at 10 10 trillion times we have
[29:49] 10 trillion times more potential as a as
[29:51] a as a solar system
[29:53] species uh to the amount of energy we
[29:56] can harness because uh that energy now
[29:59] just goes into space right it's wasted
[30:01] um we have 4 billion years left to use
[30:05] the Sun as an energy source then it will
[30:08] run
[30:09] out and um every year we're waiting we
[30:13] we're basically wasting this energy um
[30:16] so we're now uh 1,000 1,000th uh on the
[30:23] way to get to this K1 status so if we
[30:27] increase the energy production by a
[30:29] thousand times we will have K1 status
[30:32] imagine you build uh uh solar powered
[30:37] satellites around Earth uh you build up
[30:40] the solar panels also on the surface uh
[30:43] you use as as much of the energy that's
[30:45] available to the Earth for free uh then
[30:48] you're at K1 status right um and um that
[30:55] allows you to develop uh to next stage
[30:58] that would be
[30:59] K2 um cutter ship 2 level where you use
[31:02] all the energy of the sun uh it's what I
[31:05] mentioned before uh where we basically
[31:08] encircle the sun uh around Mercury we
[31:11] dismantle Mercury and build uh build
[31:14] solar panels and harness all the power
[31:16] of the Sun and uh yeah that uh gives you
[31:21] plenty of
[31:22] opportunities uh of course I believe we
[31:25] will use it 99% to mind Bitcoin and uh
[31:30] with this 1% we will have uh abundance
[31:33] for everyone we can do Interstellar
[31:37] colonization do whatever we want right
[31:40] um and that's the that's the K2 level
[31:43] basically um that's as said uh 10
[31:47] trillion times more energy than we use
[31:50] today uh it's hard to grasp but
[31:54] uh uh yeah even even if use 99% for for
[31:59] Bitcoin you know it's it's still 100
[32:03] million uh times more um than we use
[32:08] today and there's then also the uh K3
[32:13] level where we basically go go
[32:15] Interstellar and uh do this basically to
[32:19] every star in our galaxy uh and that's
[32:23] again uh 10 billion times more
[32:28] uh energy that would be available to us
[32:31] thank you you already made it halfway
[32:33] through the video and I'm really really
[32:35] grateful to have you here two things
[32:37] make this channel possible you as a
[32:39] watcher and listener who keep supporting
[32:42] this Channel and another one is all the
[32:44] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[32:46] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[32:49] very start and where I personally buy my
[32:51] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[32:53] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[32:55] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[32:58] simplest and securest way to secure your
[33:02] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[33:04] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[33:07] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[33:09] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[33:12] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[33:15] and you know your friend does not have
[33:17] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[33:18] he needs a birthday present and a small
[33:21] life Heck if you use code Robin you get
[33:23] 5% off your order plus you support my
[33:26] channel and now let's get back to the
[33:28] video do you plan to to to write a book
[33:32] around that topic I feel like that's
[33:34] like there are many great articles from
[33:36] you and and I love the the talking
[33:38] points that we already have here and
[33:40] there could be an extremely well written
[33:43] uh sci-fi story around that that's a
[33:45] little bit longer uh and with a nice
[33:49] character and everything like I would
[33:51] love to that's what I'm doing that's
[33:53] what I'm doing right so rosi is one of
[33:56] the characters in the story
[33:59] um he he
[34:01] found uh he found lost private
[34:06] keys right
[34:08] and imagine in 200 years from now
[34:12] someone finds a Bitcoin wallet with 0.1
[34:17] Bitcoin on it right it would be instant
[34:19] Fortune absolutely so but you you did
[34:23] not uh write the book till now you're
[34:25] only writing oh I'm I'm writing for a
[34:28] year now you know I I unfortunately I I
[34:31] still have a a Fiat business so I I
[34:33] don't have much time to work on the book
[34:37] um but I've been I've been uh collecting
[34:40] uh story lines and and writing chapters
[34:43] the the issue is uh I I want to have the
[34:47] World building perfect right
[34:50] I uh I want to have the the world built
[34:53] out before I really dive into the
[34:56] stories um um but there are some there's
[34:59] some stories still in there
[35:02] um and the the main story line is
[35:05] basically centered around uh a group of
[35:09] lawyers but they're Rats of course and
[35:14] um they they unlock some Mysteries uh
[35:17] surrounding the time chain its history
[35:20] its future they want to figure out what
[35:22] happened to the
[35:24] humans um because they're gone right um
[35:28] what did what did the humans do they
[35:30] don't know yet so that's the that's the
[35:33] story
[35:34] basically why RS um it's just a personal
[35:38] thing I guess uh it's it's more of a
[35:41] coincidence I I played around with M
[35:44] journey and uh at some point it it
[35:47] generated the rets and I just followed
[35:50] up on that and then I introduced you
[35:52] know all the topics I love uh Bitcoin
[35:55] space uh lawyering uh um all all that
[35:59] all that stuff and somehow this this
[36:01] narrative
[36:03] evolved and yeah I'm developing it and
[36:07] we'll see where it goes right um I first
[36:11] tried publishing these short stories you
[36:13] can find them on my Instagram uh
[36:16] rtificial
[36:18] um but somehow Instagram really punished
[36:22] the the the nonv video content right uh
[36:25] it's pretty much de for nonv video
[36:26] content unfort Ely um that's why I moved
[36:30] over to
[36:30] X and uh writing there now yeah we'll
[36:34] see if there's there's a book coming out
[36:36] at some point
[36:39] um yeah so that's the plan for that you
[36:43] could uh put those uh um text just in
[36:48] like a voice generator and let it run on
[36:52] on a video uh because I also think like
[36:54] it's it's sad that every platform even a
[36:57] they promoting with the algorithms like
[37:00] if you have the same amount of of inputs
[37:03] your video gets 2x more reach from a
[37:07] natural BP uh standpoint then your text
[37:11] of course the text could go more V if it
[37:13] hits something else but yeah in general
[37:15] you get a 2X boost just with the video
[37:18] uh it's it's a sad thing to say so see
[37:21] but that's just where the tension is
[37:23] right now and people want to see seems
[37:25] like I tried to I tried a few generators
[37:28] right uh so far they didn't they didn't
[37:31] work for me right um it it was still a
[37:35] lot of manual editing involved and stuff
[37:38] like that so uh right now it's it's it's
[37:41] it's much more time efficient right to
[37:43] to focus on my stories occasionally I
[37:46] put some story on X or or Instagram but
[37:49] yeah if I wanted to be content producer
[37:52] cont of create that's probably what what
[37:54] I should do right um create this short
[37:57] form generate stuff um maybe that's uh
[38:02] what I will go back to it's actually
[38:03] quite a good idea um to to to promote
[38:06] the account right because what good is a
[38:09] book if uh no one knows about it then no
[38:12] one can read it yeah and uh I mean once
[38:15] it's finished like then uh it's it's
[38:20] uh the the one thing that came in my
[38:22] mind when when you said it it's still a
[38:24] lot of manual work it's a lot of like I
[38:27] make this uh short form content from my
[38:30] long form podcast and people think yeah
[38:33] I just press a button and then there's
[38:34] like five videos coming out of that it's
[38:37] like five videos out of a like one or
[38:40] one and a half hour podcast still take
[38:43] me like one one and a half hours to edit
[38:46] and get everything done and that's yeah
[38:48] including already I use a lot of eii
[38:50] tools but I have a high standard I I
[38:53] want to not just pump out any video if I
[38:55] just want to out pump out any video then
[38:57] it's easy yeah I can just generate 40
[38:59] videos and publish them all but they are
[39:02] mostly garbage if you don't edit them a
[39:04] little bit yeah it's quite ironic right
[39:07] uh what I heard uh from many content
[39:10] creators actually now their first their
[39:12] first employee actually is just for this
[39:14] short form videos
[39:17] right uh like you you you have a lot of
[39:21] time on your hands to produce the long
[39:23] form you actually want right and your
[39:25] your loyal viewers want to see
[39:28] but for the the the Doom scrolling uh
[39:31] it's a it's a second full-time job
[39:33] actually it's a ma major thing yeah and
[39:36] but yeah let's let's come back to the
[39:38] topic and maybe a little bit closer to
[39:41] to the here and now you also wrote an
[39:43] article that I saw in X about the
[39:45] coexisting from Bitcoin and cbdcs I mean
[39:50] we kind of already touched on it but do
[39:51] you see like a a medium term possibility
[39:55] that cbdcs and and Bitcoin
[39:58] coexist yeah so um how to get into that
[40:04] uh what what I noticed that um why do we
[40:09] have this uh Flatline of of standard of
[40:12] living and energy production for the
[40:14] past 50 years right uh many many
[40:16] bitcoiners believe it's because we don't
[40:19] have hard money right um I don't think
[40:22] that's the the main reason actually um
[40:25] the reason is in 1971 was the uh release
[40:30] of the first Intel
[40:32] processor and uh since then we've
[40:35] seen uh just unprecedented levels of
[40:40] devaluation of human labor so the the
[40:43] worth of your working hour basically
[40:46] went down uh every year because more and
[40:50] more jobs could be
[40:52] automated um in the in the in the' 60s
[40:55] '70s you still have you had human
[40:57] calculators right computer was job
[41:00] description it was a human doing
[41:02] calculations right uh and then we had uh
[41:07] commercially available computers for the
[41:09] first time and uh businesses started to
[41:12] use them and um we've seen ever
[41:17] increasing levels of of automation so
[41:19] it's it's not just this last uh few
[41:23] years where we have ai right we have 50
[41:27] backl of 50 years of automation
[41:29] happening uh you can see that everywhere
[41:32] it look I still remember uh 20 years ago
[41:38] going to a gas station where there were
[41:40] people there right and they they they
[41:42] filled up the car for you they checked
[41:45] your your your oil and they checked your
[41:49] tires and stuff they washed your be Shi
[41:51] right there were three people working at
[41:53] this gas station tending the customers
[41:55] and that has disappeared right um
[41:58] because that process has been automated
[42:01] I mean the customer is now doing the job
[42:03] but it's still it's still automation uh
[42:07] same in the supermarkets you you have
[42:10] much less less cashiers because you have
[42:12] this automated
[42:14] process um so what has happened um the
[42:20] value of human labor has gone down
[42:24] um faster than inflation so the
[42:27] inflation adjusted thing if you look at
[42:29] any prices of of things of housing gold
[42:33] like anything that hold holds value
[42:35] right uh stocks uh the hours needed to
[42:39] to work for an ounce of gold has
[42:42] increased the you need uh back in 1970s
[42:46] you needed to
[42:48] work um two years so the average 2year
[42:51] salary has paid for a house and now you
[42:54] need 8 years so um no not only did uh
[42:59] did we remove the capability for people
[43:03] to save their money right we also uh
[43:06] took away their capabilities to earn
[43:09] money except for a few Fields like it
[43:12] the in it for instance the wages have
[43:15] more or less kept up with
[43:17] inflation
[43:19] um but we're still not uh not there if
[43:23] if if you if you adjust it correctly the
[43:26] the median salary would have to be
[43:29] 300,000 a year right uh not a lot of
[43:33] people make that I would say it's it's
[43:35] less than
[43:37] 1% um have kept up with inflation right
[43:40] and that's that's their their income
[43:41] it's not even uh the it's not even their
[43:46] their ability to save money uh we also
[43:49] took away people's ability to make
[43:52] money um and that's becoming an
[43:54] increasingly to get back to the question
[43:57] right that's becoming an
[43:59] increasingly uh bigger problem um
[44:03] because uh for for many years what uh
[44:07] what did people do to react to this
[44:09] change right because it's gradually it's
[44:10] this boiling frog thing uh first uh
[44:15] first their their usually the the wives
[44:18] also had to get a job to keep up right
[44:22] in 50 years ago uh usually one person
[44:25] could support a family on a single
[44:27] income so that's the first thing that
[44:29] disappeared now you have two people
[44:30] working
[44:32] full-time um the next happened that
[44:35] people couldn't afford to buy anymore
[44:39] more and more people are forced to
[44:41] rent um and now we have a situation
[44:45] where uh if you're in any big city um on
[44:50] the on the median salary sometimes you
[44:52] can't even afford rent so how do you fix
[44:55] this right um um Bitcoin for sure
[44:59] doesn't fix as this
[45:01] because
[45:03] um it doesn't magically create jobs uh
[45:07] where you need humans for um for the
[45:11] average person right it creates lots of
[45:13] opportunities for highly intelligent
[45:15] people or people who were early to
[45:17] bitcoin it might create some jobs where
[45:20] you know some some OG bitcoiner now
[45:23] spends their Bitcoin right but that's a
[45:26] very small part of the economy and the
[45:29] majority of people uh will ask for and
[45:32] also need some help in the form of uh UI
[45:37] Universal basic income uh will need to
[45:40] happen at some point right uh we already
[45:44] seeing uh things uh tried right we had
[45:49] in the US the stimulus checks which were
[45:52] basically the same thing in in in
[45:55] Austria we have this clean bonus right
[45:59] which is a few hundred EUR but it's a
[46:02] start right so
[46:05] you're uh you're you're you're just
[46:08] giving everyone
[46:10] money um and of course uh that causes
[46:15] inflation um and you know the
[46:19] politicians aren't dumb they know this
[46:21] problem so I think uh that's why they're
[46:24] pushing this
[46:25] cbdcs um
[46:27] because with the cbdcs you
[46:30] can uh give people this money but you
[46:33] can also control how they spend it right
[46:37] um in Germany I think they're they're
[46:40] using this now they're using it for
[46:43] immigrants right they give them a
[46:45] special uh credit card for for their
[46:48] daily purchases but this card can't be
[46:51] used let's say to buy Bitcoin or to you
[46:54] know to change this money to anything
[46:57] that holds value um so that's I think uh
[47:01] one of the required features of a c cbdc
[47:05] they're not saying that's the that's
[47:07] what it will have but
[47:10] um you if you if you give people uh Ubi
[47:14] and allow them to spend it on bitcoin
[47:16] you know what will happen right um
[47:19] Bitcoin will go to a million and um uh
[47:24] the the whole idea Falls flat right um
[47:27] so you you need to control it somehow
[47:31] it's I know it sounds dystopian I don't
[47:33] like the IDE myself but uh that would be
[47:37] one one one way to get out of this uh of
[47:41] of this of this unemployment problem we
[47:44] will have
[47:46] um and um of course what will then
[47:51] happen right let's say we have the cbdc
[47:53] for a few years um if you still have a
[47:56] job an income uh and you have half a
[47:59] brain you will put put your real money
[48:03] into Bitcoin or some some assets right
[48:05] but primarily the people will will will
[48:07] put it into Bitcoin and uh more and more
[48:11] people will will wake up and and
[48:13] understand this right it's it's it feels
[48:16] slow from the
[48:17] inside um if you're if you're Bitcoin
[48:20] for for many years it feels very slow
[48:23] this
[48:24] adoption uh but I think it's it's really
[48:26] fast if if you also compare it to to
[48:28] other technology adoptions Bitcoin is
[48:30] the fastest growing technology on the
[48:33] adoptions I think that that might happen
[48:35] so we will have for for some time this
[48:38] parallel system of cbdcs where you
[48:41] cannot you can spend it on groceries
[48:44] right you can spend it on your
[48:46] electrician bill but you cannot spend it
[48:50] on bitcoin or you cannot spend it to buy
[48:51] a house or save it right they have this
[48:55] that's even officially they have
[48:58] €3,000 uh limit plan where you cannot
[49:01] have more than €3,000 in your wallet
[49:05] so uh that's also the idea right you
[49:08] you're forced to spend it all uh but uh
[49:12] yeah uh I see that's that's inevitable
[49:15] and the the question then is of course
[49:18] how how will they finance it right how
[49:21] will we have how will we have taxes on a
[49:25] Bitcoin standard that's how always a
[49:27] question that people ask and um in in my
[49:31] book we have uh a system called
[49:34] lettuce which is basically uh like in
[49:38] medieval times uh if you wanted to enter
[49:40] the city you had to pay a a fee right so
[49:45] imagine you're in the future you want to
[49:49] go to a Bitcoin standard area can be a
[49:52] city can be a country can be a space
[49:55] station uh you need to deposit
[49:57] collateral in Bitcoin it's you're
[50:00] allowed to enter and then if you
[50:03] misbehave and that's the that's the
[50:04] important thing right if you misbehave
[50:07] they they can take this from you because
[50:11] unless you give it willingly in form of
[50:13] collateral no one can take your
[50:14] Bitcoin um so how do you enforce a legal
[50:17] system on a Bitcoin standard uh you need
[50:21] to tell people hey you want to uh live
[50:24] in in in this country you want to do
[50:26] business here uh we require you know
[50:29] some some deposit of Bitcoin and then
[50:32] you're you know you're basically a
[50:34] citizen and if you if you misbehave and
[50:37] this could be done you know we're multi
[50:39] so we would have a multi address with
[50:42] you and the
[50:44] government
[50:46] um or whatever you know institution that
[50:49] that controls this area or or gives you
[50:51] access to
[50:53] infrastructure and yeah that could be a
[50:56] a model for a Bitcoin standard in the in
[50:59] the short term I think what governments
[51:01] will do is they will use things like
[51:05] carbon tax stuff like that right you
[51:08] cannot flee it because if you want to
[51:10] live
[51:11] there uh you want to drive a car you
[51:13] want to uh buy something you want to
[51:16] build something there's there's a carbon
[51:20] thing attached to it and uh that might
[51:23] be a way to also uh tax Bitcoin as right
[51:26] because they're saying hey you everyone
[51:30] pays the carbon tax it's not the base
[51:33] for your carbon tax is not your income
[51:35] because that's gone basically the base
[51:38] of your carbon tax is your actual carbon
[51:40] emissions and either they use a social
[51:43] credit system to determine that or they
[51:45] will actually calculate it right that
[51:49] that we will see how this will work um
[51:51] but I mention something like that in the
[51:53] in the near future um how the world will
[51:57] will go again Austria Austria's news
[52:01] development is a good example here where
[52:02] they had this clima bonus so they give
[52:04] everyone money and then uh pull out the
[52:07] money again uh through a carbon tax
[52:10] it's it's uh for me as a a very
[52:14] libertarian person it's like uh it's
[52:17] it's it's a bunch of nonsense but I
[52:20] guess but I guess we we have to go
[52:25] through the with with this and and we
[52:27] have to make the best out of this and uh
[52:30] we also have to look on an individual
[52:31] level where we're like oh okay we we
[52:33] have Bitcoin we work hard we we do our
[52:36] stuffs and uh if if if one government in
[52:40] one part of the world is making
[52:41] something bad we can always move to some
[52:44] some other place uh so there's like as
[52:47] long as there's the option uh it's it's
[52:50] it's good uh and till now I also saw I
[52:54] think I got the letter for the CMA bonus
[52:56] this year like a week ago something like
[52:58] that and I was like what's that why do I
[53:01] get that like I I'm a person who does
[53:03] not need that so why are they even
[53:05] giving me me money that's like it's it's
[53:08] it doesn't make sense to give someone
[53:10] from the government just a hand that
[53:12] just uh helicopter money uh to people
[53:16] who don't even are um are not even in
[53:19] need if they for example have like oh we
[53:22] have some crisis there a lot of um
[53:25] unemployed persons and we need like
[53:28] shortterm um relief then I could even
[53:31] understand it to a certain extent even
[53:32] if I I'm not the biggest fan of that
[53:34] still uh but I couldn't understand that
[53:37] or feel like oh okay we we want to
[53:39] subsidize students and like let's let's
[53:42] give them something I don't know like
[53:44] I'm not a fan of of handouts in general
[53:47] even to people that that actually need
[53:48] it uh because I think it it interrupts
[53:51] with the free market uh and that's uh
[53:54] usually not a good idea uh but that's a
[53:58] little bit more understandable than just
[54:00] like giving money to everyone I mean
[54:02] there's different layers to that like
[54:04] there's like a thing that everyone gets
[54:06] and then there's above a thing but it it
[54:08] does not it's not a big big big jump on
[54:11] that think I had a few I had a few
[54:14] thoughts on that um
[54:16] so one one part is going back to this
[54:19] unemployment crisis right um what what
[54:23] is the reaction of of of governments to
[54:26] seeing the the value of Labor
[54:28] evaporating uh they create more
[54:31] bureaucracy they create more regulation
[54:34] because if if it's just for the for the
[54:37] base cost right a house would cost
[54:40] 50,000 EUR um it's all the
[54:45] regulation uh all the permits all the
[54:47] you know you need to get all kinds of
[54:50] expert opinions right you need this uh
[54:53] permit for for building so that drives
[54:55] up the cost in a in a huge way that
[54:57] creates jobs same with this with this
[55:00] CLE CA bonus and all these other things
[55:03] they they create all this bureaucracy
[55:06] around a thing um then you you get this
[55:11] this handout but you need to tax it
[55:13] right it's not taxfree you need to tax
[55:15] it so I I had a similar thought when
[55:17] when I got this letter I like can I can
[55:20] I not get it because it actually costs
[55:23] me more in in tax attorney fees to
[55:27] to to tax this then actually I I I
[55:30] benefit from this so it's just it's it's
[55:32] it's it's a it's a jobs program for me
[55:34] all these all these uh things are part
[55:37] also creating bureaucracy and and making
[55:40] the system run and of course it's it's
[55:43] it's jobs for the friends of the
[55:45] politicians it's it's never a free
[55:47] market so yeah I share your criticism on
[55:50] that um I still think it it will happen
[55:54] because uh most people are not educated
[55:58] enough or not uh free enough it's also a
[56:01] huge part to to fight this system um
[56:05] sure you can take your you can take your
[56:07] Bitcoin and move to Salvador but if you
[56:10] if you have a family if you have friends
[56:13] here um that's that's becoming
[56:16] increasingly unlikely and that's how
[56:17] they trap you in your system
[56:20] um my advice for young people would be
[56:25] to uh try this early very early to to
[56:29] set to set thems up uh for you know an
[56:33] international
[56:34] presence um because as you get older it
[56:37] becomes increasingly harder to do that
[56:40] because you're tied to all these things
[56:41] in your life right to a to a job to
[56:44] relatives to to friends to family you
[56:47] have your kids in school and uh you can
[56:51] can't easily move them move your whole
[56:53] family to Salvador let's say there are
[56:55] other things involved you need to
[56:57] consider so there's that that's how they
[56:58] trap you in this in the system so I
[57:01] think even if we if we go the very
[57:03] dystopian route right the government
[57:05] says hey
[57:07] we recreate a wealth tax uh you need to
[57:11] disclose all your Bitcoin Holdings or
[57:14] you're a
[57:15] criminal right uh I think a very small
[57:18] percentage will actually
[57:20] leave um most will just take it and pay
[57:24] their 2% or whatever but that's
[57:27] think uh so yes and no a little bit um
[57:32] we have this really popular example I
[57:34] forgot which city it was but like a city
[57:37] on on on the seaside where the the
[57:41] people living there was complaining that
[57:43] all the rich people came there they used
[57:45] the restaurants and everything like
[57:47] there and then they uh did not pay taxes
[57:50] because they were like just sitting on
[57:52] the on the ships and they were not
[57:53] residents there I mean they pay the
[57:55] taxes when they
[57:57] um bought for coffee basically but uh
[58:00] indirectly um but they had no other
[58:03] taxes and then uh the politics actually
[58:06] changed in that regard uh and people
[58:09] actually started like uh the the people
[58:12] that are in the boats there would have
[58:14] actually have to pay taxes um and then
[58:19] before the day before the the law was
[58:22] putting in in in place every of every
[58:25] one of those boats just just left and
[58:26] went to another uh thing so so yes and
[58:30] no I think um Bitcoin is highly fle
[58:34] money Bitcoin is like really easily
[58:37] transferred to another country because
[58:39] it's it's not physically in a country
[58:42] like you just like have to 12 words you
[58:44] can give this 12 words to someone else
[58:47] in another country and basically it's
[58:48] there and uh and you can destroy every
[58:51] every evidence of those 12 words in your
[58:54] country um then there's like no think of
[58:57] that um but I like I agree with you that
[59:01] most people want to be honest they will
[59:03] not say oh I don't have Bitcoin like I
[59:06] think even if if like actual police
[59:09] comes to your door and ask you like how
[59:10] many Bitcoins you have I think only a
[59:13] small percentage of people will say oh I
[59:14] lost it in a boating accident this funny
[59:16] meme that we all say now I I think not a
[59:19] lot of people
[59:21] will will actually go through with that
[59:24] no because that's also a very bad thing
[59:26] to do uh if you you cannot say you lost
[59:29] it in a boting exent because then you
[59:31] basically declare that if this ever
[59:34] moves again this Bitcoin ever moves
[59:36] again uh you lied right and then you go
[59:39] to jail um so what you could say is that
[59:44] you were mocked or that you were hacked
[59:47] right uh I store my you could say I
[59:50] store my Bitcoin in my physical wallet
[59:53] right my seed phrase I store it in my
[59:55] physical wallet because because whatever
[59:58] reason um not advocating you should do
[60:00] that but you could
[60:03] and uh what if you get Mo get mocked
[60:06] right you could make that argument it
[60:10] would still be a hard sell but um saying
[60:14] a boting accident in my opinion is is a
[60:16] bad take um but you covered on something
[60:20] uh very important here I think uh that
[60:23] what you said that um only a small
[60:26] percentage of people uh will be able to
[60:30] leave the system right or leav are
[60:32] leaving the system I think that's why
[60:35] Bitcoin has been successful and is
[60:37] successful um because uh it's not 100%
[60:42] Anonymous uh if it were they would have
[60:44] banned it already or tried to kill it
[60:47] early you know because if there was a
[60:50] perfect way to avoid taxes uh take away
[60:53] all your money go somewhere else if this
[60:55] was perfect and
[60:57] foolproof um you know they would fight
[60:59] it harder but uh as it is now and it's
[61:03] only very small percentage of people and
[61:06] many of them get caught if they do
[61:07] illegal stuff right because it's a
[61:09] public
[61:10] Ledger and basically only if
[61:14] you're actually fleeing a country of war
[61:18] or you're actually uh moving to another
[61:21] country legally right then it's
[61:26] it's uh then it happens then it's not an
[61:28] issue I think that's what's what's
[61:30] what's helping also Bitcoin that it's
[61:33] it's not perfect in that regard never
[61:35] thought about that that the the public
[61:37] leder is uh even even good for helping
[61:42] it to authorities to accept it and and
[61:45] getting the way in in also there in like
[61:48] a game theory move interesting you
[61:51] brought up a few points today that I
[61:53] never thought about before like I had to
[61:54] I have to do some research after for
[61:56] that I love it and I that's the point
[62:00] right yeah and this is actually like it
[62:03] comes up uh less and less because I have
[62:06] every day a Bitcoin podcast uh and
[62:08] you're my number
[62:10] 159 so I've heard from a lot of people
[62:13] their opinion on bitcoin and their angle
[62:15] on bitcoin and and their knowledge about
[62:18] Bitcoin uh so it becomes less and less
[62:20] that there's something new coming up and
[62:22] there was some some interesting talking
[62:24] points today in there and and uh I
[62:27] always love Bitcoin because I'm now in
[62:29] there for like what is it four years I
[62:32] think it's now over four years even uh
[62:35] and and still there's things coming up
[62:38] there's like oh this I never considered
[62:40] that and and oh I didn't knew about that
[62:42] and it's it's still yeah still still
[62:45] going on it's the same for
[62:48] everyone um by by writing these stories
[62:51] I discovered things about Bitcoin I
[62:53] never considered before um it's it's
[62:57] interesting you can you can open a new
[62:59] angle uh like you pick any angle uh and
[63:03] you find new understanding about Bitcoin
[63:05] that's that's really interesting I
[63:07] thought I understood it I thought I
[63:09] understood it when I first heard about
[63:10] it uh I think that was 20 2012 or
[63:14] something but uh the more you learn
[63:16] about it the more you take it seriously
[63:19] that's also a big point right everyone
[63:21] underestimates Bitcoin for for forever
[63:25] right
[63:26] I think still you underestimates it
[63:29] Michael sailor underestimates it
[63:31] everyone does
[63:33] it and that's just this this you have to
[63:36] accept that you will you will learn
[63:38] something new you will always be
[63:40] ignorant about
[63:41] Bitcoin uh and that's a good thing
[63:43] that's a that's a great way to to come
[63:46] closer to our end routine uh where we
[63:48] are saying Bitcoin you can never be
[63:50] bullish
[63:52] enough like you no I said $1 trillion
[63:56] Satoshi that's uh that's my price
[63:59] prediction $1 trillion per
[64:02] Satoshi um that's yeah I will put that
[64:05] in the thumbnail with per Bitcoin
[64:07] [Music]
[64:09] then it's a great clickbait clickbait
[64:12] headline for sure yeah
[64:15] perfect then uh we come to our inro team
[64:18] uh where we have now two questions in
[64:20] the end routin the first question is
[64:21] always the same question for every guest
[64:23] H where I want to give the stage to the
[64:27] bitcoiners so we can learn from each
[64:29] other um besides Bitcoin so what are you
[64:33] currently passionate about besides
[64:35] Bitcoin what are you currently learning
[64:37] about besides Bitcoin
[64:39] question um I'm passionate about writing
[64:44] that's that's what also Bitcoin first of
[64:47] all allowed me to do and also inspired
[64:50] me to do so uh it's a it's a long hedge
[64:53] was a long hedge dream of mine for for
[64:55] many
[64:56] many many years to to start writing on
[64:58] something uh and and that's what I'm
[65:01] passionate about right now um bringing
[65:04] my my world that uh my world somehow out
[65:08] into
[65:09] reality uh telling the stories I I came
[65:12] up with I love it a lot and and writing
[65:14] is extremely important to sort your
[65:17] thoughts and then actually uh dive
[65:19] deeper in your own brain and it's it's
[65:21] uh I'm also getting a little bit more in
[65:24] writing uh and it's it's a lovely
[65:27] experience um our other end routine is
[65:31] where the previous guest is asking a
[65:33] question for the next guest without
[65:34] knowing who actually the next guest is
[65:37] um and your question from the previous
[65:39] guest is what will be the Tipping Point
[65:42] for Bitcoin Mass adoption so like what's
[65:44] what do you think will be the trigger
[65:46] point uh when we like when we switch
[65:49] from uh um uh slowly than suddenly like
[65:54] what is it
[65:56] no then suddenly what was the thing
[65:59] before not slowly I know what you mean
[66:00] but I also don't know the exact
[66:02] definition yeah but you know I forgot
[66:05] the word but but but to answer that um I
[66:08] think what's unique about Bitcoin is
[66:10] that this this moment will never come
[66:13] it's it's it will gradually increase in
[66:16] adoption and it's it's like you're
[66:20] you're growing you're growing up right
[66:22] can you can you name a moment when you
[66:24] were like now an adult uh probably not I
[66:27] mean some people have a story right um
[66:30] but it's been a gradual uh
[66:33] climb and uh that's that's interesting I
[66:37] think every individual will have this
[66:39] moment for them I guess uh both of us
[66:43] already had this moment in their in
[66:44] their past where they they had this
[66:46] suddenly moment for Bitcoin right they
[66:49] it was an afterthought for many years
[66:51] you heard about it you maybe researched
[66:53] it maybe invested a bit but at some
[66:54] point you were like W this this this
[66:57] thing is huger than I think so I think
[67:00] every person will have this moment at at
[67:03] some point but it's it's not it's not
[67:05] going to be a global event it's going to
[67:07] be
[67:08] a an an individual experience for
[67:11] everyone yeah it's it's I I now know it
[67:13] gradually then suddenly because you also
[67:15] said the word gradually and now now I
[67:18] know it again uh yeah that's it's a good
[67:20] point that this will be like uh Al an
[67:23] individual um experience on that
[67:26] um perfect then before I can let you go
[67:29] where can people read you where can
[67:31] people find out more about you yeah so
