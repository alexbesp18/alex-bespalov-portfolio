[00:00] all of a sudden it was hundreds to
[00:02] thousands of dollars to make a
[00:03] transaction on bitcoin and I don't think
[00:05] that everyone was quite ready for that
[00:06] and so I think that people are kind of
[00:08] waking up that even though the fees are
[00:09] low right now that's not always going to
[00:11] be the case and they need to be prepared
[00:13] I've been in Bitcoin since about 2012 so
[00:15] I was pretty early into you know getting
[00:17] involved with Bitcoin kind of credit
[00:18] card debit card scenario is more like
[00:20] lightning and then the banking system is
[00:21] more like Bitcoin the Bitcoin base layer
[00:23] is the ultimate kind of assurity and
[00:25] you're moving maybe larger amounts there
[00:27] but then also you're using lightning for
[00:29] more of the daily transactions and
[00:30] things like that if you don't have
[00:31] anywhere to use it well it's not going
[00:33] to be adopted we need something to be
[00:34] able to scale it and scale it well the
[00:36] use case for gold has like gone down
[00:38] while Bitcoin is like just starting and
[00:39] like its use case and what it can do
[00:41] it's pretty obvious that we need some
[00:42] sort of like L2 or some other solution
[00:45] of actually doing these transactions um
[00:47] that are not always on the Bitcoin base
[00:49] [Music]
[00:53] layer I think it's it's really
[00:55] interesting when we talk about Bitcoin
[00:57] because we we kind of I think a
[01:00] consensus that we cannot scale Bitcoin
[01:02] on on layer one that we kind of have to
[01:04] scale up in in in in layer twos and I
[01:08] think the winner might be lightning I
[01:11] think that lightning has a really good
[01:12] chance to be number one uh of of the
[01:15] layer toos um before we dive into uh
[01:19] lightning and the developments there
[01:21] maybe let's take a small step back and
[01:24] and and talk about uh how in general you
[01:27] see Bitcoin scaling to the future uh uh
[01:32] will look like because we have the
[01:34] limited base
[01:35] layer yeah definitely I mean I think
[01:37] that the there's obviously been a lot of
[01:40] conversations about how we scale Bitcoin
[01:43] um for many years I mean I think the the
[01:45] biggest one the most notable one is like
[01:47] the block size Wars and talking about do
[01:50] we make the the the blocks bigger do we
[01:53] do something else and like how do we
[01:54] scale how do we get more transactions in
[01:57] on basically on chain or or inside of
[01:58] the bit Bitcoin you go system one way or
[02:00] the other um I think the lightning is
[02:02] definitely the prominent way of doing
[02:04] that um it's obviously you know the most
[02:06] used like L2 today I think I guess maybe
[02:09] to even take a step back from that it's
[02:11] pretty obvious that we need some sort of
[02:12] like L2 or some other solution of
[02:15] actually doing these transactions um
[02:17] that are not always on the Bitcoin base
[02:19] layer um you know at at the time of
[02:21] recording the men pool is like pretty
[02:23] pretty light right now but that's not
[02:25] always going to be the case that has not
[02:26] always been the case so we we need to
[02:28] have some other method of actually
[02:31] increasing the amount of not only the
[02:34] amount of transactions we can do in
[02:35] Bitcoin but then also like the speed and
[02:37] the fees and all these different you
[02:39] know variables we see lightning as
[02:40] definitely being the the number one
[02:42] solution for that um and it's been
[02:44] pretty obvious in terms of adoption
[02:46] there's some other Solutions like liquid
[02:48] or some like State chain based proposals
[02:51] been out there but none of them have
[02:52] shown to be actually all of that all
[02:54] that good or all that useful so we see
[02:56] lightning and that's that's the most
[02:58] adopted L2 that exists on Bitcoin so we
[03:00] see it as definitely the winner there
[03:02] and we we're we're we're heavily uh kind
[03:05] of doubling down on Lightning being the
[03:06] winner there um because we think that it
[03:08] is the best method of actually moving
[03:10] value um in the world not only just
[03:12] Bitcoin but just value in general
[03:14] interesting uh why do you think
[03:17] lightning will will be wi winners like
[03:19] the the other ones are technically not
[03:21] as capable or is it already the network
[03:23] effect of of lightning being early and
[03:26] and being already so
[03:27] adopted yeah I mean I think that it's I
[03:29] think the the network effects that
[03:31] lightning has are definitely um one of
[03:33] the big advantages it has but I think
[03:35] that there's a lot of other um proposals
[03:37] out there that come with a lot of
[03:39] tradeoffs so like fedy Min or you fedy
[03:41] Min is is an example of a you know a
[03:43] federation type model which I think is
[03:45] very interesting I think that that's
[03:47] absolutely a solution that will work and
[03:49] be uh prevalent but it's obviously a
[03:51] very very trusted system and so it's not
[03:53] um doesn't come with the same properties
[03:55] that exist in Bitcoin on from like the
[03:57] Bas layer perspective um you're
[03:58] obviously trusting a group of people
[04:00] with kind of your funds at that point so
[04:02] um those things I think will be used
[04:04] they will be around um I don't think
[04:07] that they kind of solve Bitcoin scaling
[04:09] in the ways of keeping the same
[04:11] properties that exist inside of Bitcoin
[04:12] like lightning does like with unilateral
[04:15] exit opportunities and things like that
[04:16] so um being able to keep the same
[04:19] properties lightning is the only one
[04:20] that can do that um anything that's like
[04:22] State chain based or anything like that
[04:24] is inherently um more trusted um same
[04:26] thing with liquid there's a federation
[04:28] behind it and things like that so not
[04:30] saying those are all like will never
[04:31] work like they can obviously work but
[04:33] they come with a lot of tradeoffs that
[04:34] you need to kind of consider and those
[04:37] are some trade-offs that not a lot of
[04:38] people are going to be willing to to go
[04:41] with um where they want you know
[04:43] complete control of their funds and
[04:44] things like that that lightning is able
[04:46] to bring so I think it's um there will
[04:48] be other Solutions but it's something
[04:50] that every user was going to have to
[04:51] really evaluate in terms of what are the
[04:53] trade off and how do you want to where
[04:54] do you want to interact at maybe a
[04:56] question that I should have started like
[04:58] people in the comments always wrote in
[04:59] me that I never let the guests introduce
[05:02] themselves because I usually think it's
[05:04] like I kind of like all like I care
[05:07] about the opinions and not like what
[05:09] he's working at and like it kind of gets
[05:10] boring for me but I think the people
[05:13] actually care about that that stuff so
[05:15] uh maybe it's also interesting like what
[05:17] what are you doing and and what are you
[05:19] kind of like doing in the uh in the
[05:22] Bitcoin lightning space and what is wage
[05:24] or also the the sign right behind you
[05:27] doing yeah definitely so so I'm my name
[05:31] is Graham I'm founder and CEO of voltage
[05:33] um and so voltage is a infrastructure
[05:35] provider a payment processor for
[05:37] lightening and Bitcoin transactions um
[05:39] so I've been in Bitcoin since about 2012
[05:42] so I was pretty early into you know
[05:44] getting involved with Bitcoin I've been
[05:46] involved in the ecosystem writing open
[05:48] source text doing a bunch of just
[05:49] different things and kind of just
[05:50] participating anywhere I could um and I
[05:53] kept hitting the same issue over and
[05:54] over again of anytime you want to build
[05:56] applications on top of Bitcoin it was
[05:58] always a big hurdle just to get up and
[06:00] running with you know configuring
[06:02] Bitcoin core or even doing a lightning
[06:04] node and setting up the channels and
[06:06] doing all the things that go into that
[06:07] um it was always very challenging um and
[06:10] so that's where I kind of had the idea
[06:12] for voltage is we want a really easy way
[06:14] of just being able to plug in to the
[06:16] Bitcoin Network very easily hit some
[06:18] apis and be able to send and receive
[06:20] transactions um so that was the the kind
[06:22] of original um idea for voltage is just
[06:24] making building applications on bitcoin
[06:27] far easier than it was previously so
[06:30] kind of where we're at today um you know
[06:31] we we're the largest infrastructure
[06:33] provider for lightning and so we have
[06:35] both like a node service that be is able
[06:38] to like run nodes host them um help
[06:40] people with some of the liquidity and
[06:42] like all those different things um but
[06:44] then we also have some new things that
[06:45] we're working on that are even like
[06:46] simplified versions of um lightning and
[06:49] being able to integrate there so uh we
[06:51] got kind of across the board a lot of
[06:53] different solutions but at the end of
[06:54] the day we help businesses incorporate
[06:56] lightning into their products and
[06:57] services far easier and far faster than
[07:00] they would be doing it um with any other
[07:03] provider or doing it themselves um so
[07:05] we've been able to really you know take
[07:07] take hold of that and really focus on
[07:09] incorporating lightning into these
[07:11] businesses that either already move a
[07:13] bunch of Bitcoin they want to do it
[07:14] faster and cheaper or they're looking
[07:15] for efficiencies that maybe they don't
[07:17] have in their business
[07:19] already that's a that's a great thing to
[07:21] to do I think like lightning is such an
[07:23] and it it's really early stage because
[07:26] most people like still are like on on
[07:28] Bas layer you mentioned mention the fees
[07:30] are really low right now so you can
[07:32] actually make a bunch of onchain
[07:34] transactions but I do think long term
[07:37] the fees are really headed uh into the
[07:40] hundreds uh maybe even like thousands of
[07:42] of dollars per per um per transactions I
[07:45] don't know what what this will be then
[07:47] in in satoshis but like in in Fe terms
[07:49] the transactions volume the transactions
[07:53] fees will be I think quite High uh once
[07:56] uh there's a lot of volume on bitcoin
[07:59] and once people also starting to use it
[08:00] as a medium exchange and not just
[08:02] storing and if you just store it you
[08:04] don't you don't uh uh transact too too
[08:08] much but uh even even if you even if the
[08:11] whole world just uses as a store of
[08:13] value you will still have a lot of
[08:15] traffic going around uh where you need a
[08:18] layer to uh and I think it's really
[08:20] important to build out those Med of
[08:21] exchange tools uh really early on I like
[08:25] I like that you like you doing that and
[08:27] that you're already developing in there
[08:29] yeah I mean absolutely I definitely
[08:31] agree that I think that there's were
[08:34] there there's been a lot of different
[08:35] cycles of Bitcoin fees um going up and
[08:37] going down right now we're in a pretty
[08:39] low fee environment but I think that
[08:40] we've seen a lot of people still waking
[08:42] up to the fact that that's not always
[08:43] going to be the case like with a last Fe
[08:46] Spar Spike um it was kind of created by
[08:48] like the ordinal craze and people doing
[08:50] a bunch of ordinal creation on chain um
[08:52] that CAU people completely off guard
[08:54] where all of a sudden it was hundreds to
[08:56] thousands of dollars to make a
[08:58] transaction on bitcoin um and I don't
[09:00] think that everyone was quite ready for
[09:01] that and so I think that people are kind
[09:03] of waking up that even though the fees
[09:05] are low right now that's not always
[09:06] going to be the case and they need to be
[09:08] prepared so um we definitely see that
[09:09] resonating with
[09:11] customers yeah I'm I'm looking forward
[09:13] to because since around half a year or
[09:16] like three three quarters of a year
[09:19] something like that are getting paid in
[09:21] in Bitcoin now and we did it all onchain
[09:23] um but if the fees ran up to a czy
[09:27] amount like we have to do this lightning
[09:30] uh and we we had kind of have to to move
[09:32] that because like the the things are not
[09:34] that good but since we since I get paid
[09:36] in Bitcoin the fees actually really low
[09:38] so it has been quite nice to have like
[09:41] uh the the payment coming in and
[09:43] directly in yours of custody solution uh
[09:46] that's an amazing experience but I think
[09:49] um Bob Beret really puts it nicely of
[09:52] like we used to Rolling in a Rolls-Royce
[09:55] uh that's a luxury item uh and we will
[09:58] not all do that for all transactions
[10:00] like Bas layer Bitcoin transaction is
[10:03] like a luxury thing and we should not
[10:05] get used to that that's a that's a thing
[10:07] where you like transact big things or
[10:10] like uh once a month maybe you get money
[10:13] out there for like for your M for your
[10:16] wallet or something like that um do you
[10:19] also see it like that like where Bitcoin
[10:21] is like the the main layer where you
[10:23] save money and then like you have a
[10:24] layer two uh where for your day orto day
[10:27] spending for like free three month or
[10:29] stuff like that and maybe you have even
[10:31] have on top of lightning something for
[10:32] the daily
[10:34] transactions yeah I mean I I do see it
[10:36] very similar um I think that there's uh
[10:38] I think that as you know volumes
[10:40] increase on the Bitcoin base layer it
[10:42] will be harder and harder to get your
[10:43] transactions in especially when you
[10:45] think about you know the when you talk
[10:47] about you know medium of exchange or
[10:49] something like that being able to use it
[10:50] for more of a kind of everyday payment
[10:52] mechanism e even let's say even the
[10:54] block space is is clear or there there's
[10:57] relatively you know um low activity you
[10:59] still have to wait an hour at least for
[11:02] like you know block confirmations to
[11:03] feel you know confident in that payment
[11:05] being confirmed and so that that alone
[11:08] um even you know even in a Loi
[11:09] environment that alone you know is very
[11:11] very lightning is subsec and so that
[11:13] experience is far far better and so I do
[11:15] think that I agree that there's the way
[11:17] that I kind of think about it is the
[11:18] Bitcoin base layer is sort of like you
[11:20] know the banks and how they're all
[11:21] connected like you know you people are
[11:23] generally not doing like AC transfers or
[11:25] something like that on a daily basis um
[11:28] they're usually doing that you know
[11:29] pretty infrequently and it's generally
[11:31] larger amounts of money or wire
[11:33] transfers or something like that where
[11:35] you know you use a credit card or a
[11:36] debit card every day or very very
[11:38] frequently um and so I think that the
[11:41] the kind of credit card debit card
[11:42] scenario is more like lightning and then
[11:44] the banking system is more like Bitcoin
[11:45] where you have um the that's the Bitcoin
[11:48] is the ultim the Bitcoin base layer is
[11:50] the ultimate kind of assurity and you're
[11:52] moving maybe larger amounts there but
[11:54] then also you're using lightning for
[11:56] more of the daily transactions and
[11:58] things like that but I also think that
[12:00] you can move significant amounts of
[12:01] money on top of lightning like you can
[12:03] do millions of dollars in payments um on
[12:05] lightning and so um it doesn't
[12:07] completely rule it out from doing larger
[12:09] payments but just kind of comparing you
[12:11] know the two there that's the way that
[12:13] I've kind of been thinking about it is
[12:14] it's really um like a banking versus
[12:16] like a credit card yeah that's an
[12:18] interesting uh uh way to look at it um
[12:22] now let's come to to the lightning where
[12:25] where in the development we we currently
[12:27] are and then maybe afterwards where
[12:28] where we of had it of of where we talk a
[12:32] lot about where Bitcoin is and the
[12:33] adoption cycle and nation states and
[12:36] they adopting it and stuff like that uh
[12:39] and with lightning we usually like just
[12:40] talk about like oh yeah like they had
[12:42] those apps and it's but where in the
[12:46] adoption cycle of lightning are we and
[12:49] in general where we are at with with
[12:51] lightning yeah I mean definitely like we
[12:54] it's lighting has been you know more or
[12:55] less usable since about 2018 um so it
[12:57] has been around for a little a while um
[13:00] that said it has taken a while to get um
[13:02] it to be really usable and getting a lot
[13:04] of you know service providers to to to
[13:06] leverage it um so where we're at now I
[13:08] mean the 2024 was a pretty big year for
[13:10] lightning where we had a lot of um just
[13:13] larger scale um exchanges payment
[13:15] processors those kinds of folks starting
[13:17] to adopt it and we think that this uh
[13:19] 2025 is going to be an even larger year
[13:21] we see a huge amount of influx of of
[13:24] people supporting it and adopting it and
[13:25] so it's kind of one of those things
[13:26] where you need like the flywheel to
[13:28] build where you need need more wallets
[13:30] to support it so then more exchanges can
[13:31] support it and then you have more
[13:33] opportunity to use it because that's
[13:34] been one of the hardest parts of
[13:36] adoption is if you don't have anywhere
[13:37] to use it well it's not going to be
[13:38] adopted you know you got to have kind of
[13:40] both ends of a transaction um to make it
[13:42] useful um and so we're starting to see
[13:44] that we've seen that um at the kind of
[13:46] the second half of 2024 was pretty
[13:48] significant and we think that that's
[13:50] going to carry uh into 2025 and be be a
[13:52] pretty big deal um there's also one of
[13:55] the the hardest parts of like
[13:56] quantifying the the adoption rate or how
[13:59] much usage lightning Network gets
[14:01] because it's it's a peer-to-peer Network
[14:03] it's not a public blockchain like when
[14:04] you look at Bitcoin layer one or
[14:06] ethereum salana you name you name any
[14:08] chain out there almost all of them are
[14:11] public blockchains and so you can see
[14:13] exactly who is transacting where and
[14:15] when and so you can really get a good
[14:16] understanding of you know Bitcoin is
[14:18] moving you know $50 million today it's
[14:21] moving $100 million today whatever it is
[14:23] um with lightning since the entire
[14:25] system is peer-to-peer there's no public
[14:27] metrics on like how many transactions
[14:29] are happening all those different things
[14:31] and so it's because it's just between me
[14:33] and you know the sender and the
[14:34] recipient um are the only ones that
[14:36] really know about it so the ways of
[14:37] quantifying it are much much harder um
[14:40] the public metrics of lightning are like
[14:41] node count uh transaction or uh sorry
[14:44] Channel count and then Channel capacity
[14:46] those are all like okay metrics but they
[14:48] don't really actually tell you how much
[14:49] is being used behind the scenes and so
[14:52] that's one of the also parts that's
[14:53] really hard to quantify and we have a
[14:55] report coming out in about a in a couple
[14:57] weeks or so with a with Fidelity that
[14:59] will really highlight a lot of the kind
[15:01] of the underlying usage behind it where
[15:03] we're seeing a very very steady increase
[15:06] in transaction volume um on lightning
[15:09] today uh and we think that that's going
[15:10] to really explode in this next year
[15:13] interesting uh and and how do you get
[15:17] those numbers like how do you uh try to
[15:19] figure out where we are with with the
[15:21] usage numbers as you described that it's
[15:23] it's kind of hard yeah I mean it's like
[15:26] you basically have to be like operating
[15:27] our not or operating a system like our
[15:29] like us and so since we are the largest
[15:32] provider for lightning transactions
[15:34] today we have a huge amount of data um
[15:36] and so just looking at kind of like a
[15:37] subset of like anonymized data it's like
[15:39] generally how many transactions are
[15:41] happening in a week or a month or
[15:42] anything like that on lightning and so
[15:44] um the only way to really get that data
[15:46] is to either be running a node yourself
[15:48] and kind of keeping track of that
[15:49] yourself or like a service provider like
[15:51] us that can actually you know that is
[15:52] processing payments for other folks um
[15:55] and being able to aggregate that data
[15:57] how fast are we currently growing if you
[15:59] see the the the data of like how much
[16:01] how many more transactions have be made
[16:03] and stuff like that uh I think it's also
[16:05] interesting to know from that the
[16:08] Bitcoin adoption cycle because I think
[16:10] it correlates to a certain um certain
[16:14] extent because if more people use
[16:16] Bitcoin on Lightning this also means
[16:18] more people in general use Bitcoin as a
[16:21] med of exchange already uh which is
[16:23] super fascinating to see how fast is
[16:25] kind of the growth rate of of those
[16:27] those numbers Uh current
[16:30] yeah I mean we're seeing so like even
[16:32] mentioning like uh one of the public
[16:33] reports was like River's report in 2024
[16:36] I think it showed like 1200% growth over
[16:38] the last two years um and we're seeing
[16:41] that continuing um and I think that
[16:43] we'll again we'll even we've started to
[16:44] in just the tail end of 24 we saw that
[16:46] starting to increase and we think that
[16:48] that will continue to increase um with
[16:50] things like St stable coins on top of
[16:52] lightning which we'll get into a little
[16:54] bit later but um being able to really um
[16:57] have some new assets to move as well I
[16:59] think will really significantly increase
[17:01] it so I mean we're seeing like thousands
[17:03] of percent increase um across like you
[17:06] know since Inception and then we're
[17:07] seeing we're starting that even to go
[17:09] into the direction of thousands of
[17:10] percent increase um year-over-year as
[17:12] well so I mean we're seeing it very
[17:15] substantially pick up and I think that
[17:17] ultimately like the value at is you know
[17:19] being able to move uh any kind of value
[17:22] um faster and cheaper where you can
[17:23] basically send a million dollars have it
[17:25] settle you know an under half of a
[17:28] second and pay zero fees on it that's
[17:31] very very significant and people are
[17:32] starting to wake up into what like how
[17:34] that impacts their
[17:35] business how important do you feel is
[17:38] the lightning adoption for the Bitcoin
[17:41] adoption and the Bitcoin narrative
[17:44] overall yeah I mean I think it's pretty
[17:46] important um because I mean like since
[17:48] Inception I mean Bitcoin has always had
[17:49] kind of the digital gold comparison
[17:51] which I think is valid but there's so
[17:53] much more that is there as well um and
[17:55] people try and put it into a specific
[17:57] bucket um which Bitcoin is very unique
[17:59] and that it can kind of fit into a lot
[18:00] of buckets it can do a lot of different
[18:01] things um and so I think it's very
[18:03] important for the overall kind of
[18:04] Bitcoin um investment thesis or just
[18:07] view um and that it can be very
[18:09] versatile and can do these different
[18:10] things and so uh and then also when we
[18:13] think about you know large scale Global
[18:15] adoption of Bitcoin um we need something
[18:17] to be able to scale it and scale it well
[18:20] and so that's where that's where we're
[18:22] seeing lightning kind of taking hold and
[18:24] so there's uh there's a huge amount of
[18:27] opportunity uh for to really resonate
[18:30] with with investors or just people
[18:32] looking at Bitcoin and the fact that
[18:33] there is a way of you just storing it
[18:35] holding on to it and it's incredibly
[18:37] safe but then also if you want to use it
[18:40] or if you want to move it uh anywhere
[18:43] you can do that pretty efficiently as
[18:44] well so I think it's very important to
[18:46] have both of those aspects yeah it's
[18:49] Bitcoin is so unique because like we
[18:51] never had such an asset which is open
[18:55] Digital uh limited strictly Limited
[18:59] uh and accessible to everyone it's it's
[19:01] an asset that everyone needs even though
[19:05] they might not know it yet uh and that
[19:08] is also accessible for everyone and is
[19:10] still completely limited and there's no
[19:13] way of manipulating it and there's no
[19:15] way to make more of it like that in
[19:18] itself is so interesting and I think
[19:21] that's why people are so bad in
[19:24] describing what what Bitcoin really is
[19:27] like you have so many different
[19:29] descriptions like even if you look at
[19:31] that podcast I'm I'm closing down on
[19:34] like 400 uh episodes now uh and I I
[19:38] often ask like what is bitcoin like what
[19:41] is the most exciting point of Bitcoin
[19:43] like what is the interesting aspect that
[19:45] you see in Bitcoin and there are like
[19:47] 400 different explanations of that and
[19:50] and it's really fun to see
[19:52] that yeah I mean I I totally agree I
[19:54] think that and that's I think that's one
[19:56] of the great the great properties of
[19:58] Bitcoin is just how versatile it is and
[20:00] then you know and that is interesting to
[20:01] know when you ask someone you know what
[20:03] is bitcoin um the difference in in
[20:05] answer shows kind of where they're where
[20:08] they view it as like where is it
[20:10] important to them whether it's like
[20:11] investment or means of value or
[20:13] something like that or transfer um so I
[20:15] think that's that's very interesting and
[20:17] that's it's that's what's I think been
[20:18] really hard for more traditional um
[20:21] investors people that are just in
[20:22] traditional Finance to like understand
[20:24] Bitcoin because it it's it's so
[20:26] different than anything else that has
[20:27] ever existed and as it's really hard for
[20:29] some people to wrap their minds around I
[20:32] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[20:35] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[20:38] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[20:41] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[20:43] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[20:47] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[20:50] go out there and show that you are a
[20:52] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[20:55] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[20:58] dropped the the completely new and
[21:00] amazing Genesis edition of their watch
[21:03] collections you have the date of the
[21:05] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[21:09] and of course also the block height and
[21:11] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[21:15] the level of detail they put in in this
[21:17] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[21:20] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[21:23] down in the descriptions I love those
[21:25] watches so so much if you watch or
[21:29] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[21:31] I'll guess you already bought some
[21:33] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[21:36] is to keep their Bitcoin keep them
[21:39] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[21:41] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[21:43] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[21:46] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[21:48] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[21:51] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[21:54] with the code Robin at the checkout
[21:57] visit bitbox Swiss SL robobin to get
[22:01] your bitbox and the next step is to
[22:03] really level up your sovereignty as an
[22:05] individual you have to have the most
[22:08] secure self- custody setup you have to
[22:10] secure your own devices you have to
[22:13] protect your privacy you have to set up
[22:16] an inheritance plan and depending on
[22:19] where you live you even want to have a
[22:21] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[22:24] in case something goes really really
[22:26] wrong and through all those steps the
[22:27] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step

[22:35] Partners Robin you even get a 30 minute
[22:38] free call to find out how you can level
[22:41] up your
[22:42] sovereignty yeah and and yeah like
[22:45] usually there's like um a management
[22:48] team behind that kind of crafts the
[22:51] story uh and like if there's like a
[22:54] Tesla or like Uber or like some stock
[22:57] out there they usually have a story for
[22:59] that they usually try to convey a story
[23:02] to the to the investors but there's
[23:05] nobody conveying a story to bitcoin
[23:07] investors I mean there are I a bunch of
[23:10] people that try to convey that but
[23:12] because there are so many uh and so many
[23:14] different ones it's not it's not one
[23:16] story and I think that's a a confusing
[23:19] part um and people Al like oh like
[23:21] that's all gold but gold has been around
[23:24] for so long so the story has kind of
[23:27] been built what gold is and it has been
[23:30] ingrained for like thousands of years in
[23:32] in in in Civilization and in in the
[23:34] human Spirit uh where Bitcoin is really
[23:37] new and and go go out there ask 100
[23:41] people what Bitcoin is and you get like
[23:42] 100 different answers uh most of them
[23:45] probably really uh really uninformed uh
[23:49] that shows you how how early we are but
[23:52] it's a it's an it's an exciting time to
[23:53] be alive and to witness this this kind
[23:55] of Bitcoin transformation is kind of uh
[23:59] Financial Revolution I I I do think we
[24:02] we are in a special part of
[24:05] History yeah I mean I yeah I def I
[24:07] definitely agree um that's why it's one
[24:09] of the most exciting um places to be
[24:11] building a company and working in I mean
[24:13] there's just yeah there's so much going
[24:14] on and it's interesting when people
[24:16] compare it to Gold it's like yeah gold
[24:18] has been around for thousands of years
[24:20] um and it's it it's less has less
[24:23] utility now than it used to because
[24:25] people used to actually transact with
[24:26] gold they used to have like gold coins
[24:27] and things like that and now it's like
[24:29] you don't really do any of that today
[24:31] it's more of just that store value and
[24:32] so the use case for gold is like gone
[24:34] down while Bitcoin is like just starting
[24:36] and like its use case and what it can do
[24:38] so it I think it's really interesting to
[24:40] compare the two because they're they're
[24:41] so different at the end of the day
[24:43] absolutely um what is the for you
[24:46] outside of of lightning maybe what is
[24:48] the most exciting aspect for you for for
[24:51] Bitcoin all like maybe what also what
[24:53] what captured your attention at first
[24:55] with with Bitcoin yeah I mean I I'm just
[24:57] I've been like a a tech Enthusiast a
[25:00] software engineer for a really really
[25:01] long time and that was just what
[25:03] originally brought brought um interest
[25:05] to me in Bitcoin is just the complete
[25:08] newness of the protocol itself and the
[25:10] network and just what it can do like
[25:12] there's obviously nothing that had
[25:13] existed before it um that was very very
[25:16] exciting to me and then just being able
[25:17] to um I was just fascinated by the fact
[25:20] that you know someone could move value
[25:21] from one place to another without having
[25:24] any intermediary or someone to be able
[25:26] to um deny the payment or clot back or
[25:29] do any of those things and the the
[25:30] ability of it to be a truly peer-to-peer
[25:33] means of moving value was incredibly
[25:36] interesting to me um and and that that
[25:39] was what originally kind of kicked it
[25:40] off and then you once you start to like
[25:42] actually research how does this work
[25:44] like how is like the the consensus ran
[25:46] there's like all these miners like the
[25:48] the rabbit hole just goes very very deep
[25:50] as we you know we all know and there's
[25:51] just like an endless amount of things
[25:53] that you can learn um and so it was like
[25:55] the first thing that caught my eye was
[25:57] just this Global pain system that you
[25:59] can just move money anywhere in the
[26:00] world um that was like holy cow that's
[26:03] that's incredibly massive that's it's
[26:05] it's insane um how does this work and
[26:08] then then you you know then it's kind of
[26:09] like game over you're like researching
[26:11] how does this all work and then you get
[26:13] into like the the economics of it of
[26:15] like the fixed Supply and all these
[26:16] things and it's just kind of like
[26:17] endless from there so um I originally
[26:19] you know there's a couple people always
[26:21] approach it either from from what I see
[26:23] either from like the investment
[26:24] standpoint or like that fiscal policy
[26:26] standpoint of like oh it's it's
[26:27] important because there is a fixed
[26:29] Supply you can't make more of it those
[26:30] kinds of things and there's the other
[26:31] people of coming out from the tech side
[26:33] of whether it's you know the Privacy
[26:35] Tech or just the ability of like
[26:36] uncensored money those kinds of things
[26:39] um and so people come at it from like
[26:40] either Tech or or investment I guess and
[26:42] I was definitely on the tech side um I
[26:45] was you know I remember the day that
[26:46] Bitcoin broke five dollars a coin um and
[26:49] I wish that I could say you know I I put
[26:50] my life savings into it but I didn't
[26:52] just because it was this cool technology
[26:54] and I was not thinking at all about the
[26:56] ramifications of it from like a monetary
[26:58] policy perspective so um I was
[27:00] definitely a big tech nerd and that's
[27:01] why I got into it in the first place I
[27:04] was that see saying Bitcoin break5 and
[27:07] then also seeing Bitcoin break
[27:09] $100,000 how was that those feelings I
[27:12] mean it was it was awes when it broke $5
[27:15] I remember actually kind of complaining
[27:17] about it because it was like this hobby
[27:18] this thing that I like to do is getting
[27:19] expensive it was like you know if you're
[27:21] like doing like something is like wood
[27:24] is getting if I'm like a carpenter in my
[27:26] free time and wood is getting expensive
[27:27] I'm going to
[27:28] um so I was like kind of complaining
[27:30] about like Bitcoins are getting
[27:31] expensive and I want to keep you know
[27:33] playing and doing doing all these
[27:34] different things with it um so
[27:36] originally it was like you know I was a
[27:37] little upset which is just crazy to
[27:39] think about and then now when I you know
[27:41] just recently passed $100,000 um I don't
[27:43] know I feel like I've I've been through
[27:45] so many of like the ups and downs when
[27:47] it broke $1,000 and then $10,000 and so
[27:50] on I it's unfortunate that I feel a
[27:51] little like I don't know it's just kind
[27:53] of like all cycles of just the ups and
[27:54] downs um but it was an incredibly it was
[27:57] incredible accomplishment to really um
[28:00] to see it to see it do that to see the
[28:02] value and people actually valuing it at
[28:04] this level um and fulfill a lot of the
[28:07] things that we were thinking about back
[28:09] in 2012 um so it was actually it was
[28:11] really exciting at the same time of you
[28:13] know we go through a lot of Cycles but
[28:15] actually seeing it across this Milestone
[28:17] was was you know pretty cool to see I
[28:20] sometimes ask myself if Satoshi knew
[28:23] what was coming if like if he actually
[28:26] had planned of like all the option
[28:28] cycles of like what what Bitcoin is
[28:32] coming I'm I'm always when I think about
[28:34] the history I'm like did he did he
[28:37] foresee
[28:38] that what was his plan there uh that
[28:42] that's kind of crazy maybe he was just a
[28:44] uh uh like all right let's let's do
[28:47] something and let's try to fix the
[28:49] system uh and he never anticipated it
[28:52] for for it being so big he just wanted
[28:54] to make a a good alternative to that
[28:57] it's it's kind of fascinating to see
[28:59] especially if you're like oh like
[29:00] reached a dollar then it reached $10 a
[29:02] thousand then 100,000 and it's like that
[29:06] that was real quick like 15 years it's
[29:08] not that long of a time uh and now uh
[29:12] presidents are talking about it Nation
[29:15] talking about it um yeah that's kind of
[29:18] amazing how do you actually see the the
[29:22] if like El Salvador is is doing Bitcoin
[29:25] developments but also not an America
[29:27] Nations instead of doing it is that
[29:29] impacting also the lightning adoption or
[29:31] how do you look at uh those those things
[29:33] in the adoption
[29:35] cycle yeah I mean I I think it depends I
[29:37] think that um like like El Salvador for
[29:39] example you know they they with their
[29:41] whole legal tender and things like that
[29:43] that obviously was a big deal for
[29:45] lightning because it was kind of making
[29:47] it usable in everyday scenarios like you
[29:50] know putting it into storefronts and all
[29:52] those things so that was very impactful
[29:54] for lightning and actually being able to
[29:56] I mean uh you know the the the roll out
[29:58] of that is like you know very debatable
[30:00] whether you know that was like
[30:01] successful or not but like ultimately
[30:03] being able to have it as a medium of
[30:05] exchange um is very very good for
[30:07] lightning on the flip side you know here
[30:09] in like in the United States you know
[30:10] they're talking about adding it to like
[30:11] a Bitcoin strategic Reserve um which is
[30:14] very interesting but like I wouldn't say
[30:15] that that is on its own very impactful
[30:18] for lightning because that's not um
[30:20] putting it into storefronts it's not
[30:21] doing all those things it's just
[30:22] literally the government buying you know
[30:25] x amount of Bitcoin and just keeping it
[30:27] in like a treasury you know a vault so
[30:28] to speak um so that's a it's a little
[30:31] bit different of like um ways of
[30:33] approaching it but overall I think that
[30:35] it is incredibly important that uh we
[30:37] see people like both the US government
[30:39] El Salvador government there's you know
[30:41] countless other ones that are have
[30:42] talked about it at least um and that's
[30:45] like that's a huge validation point I
[30:47] think in the ways that they're talking
[30:48] about it it used to be that these
[30:50] governments like Russia and China we
[30:52] talking about how can we shut this down
[30:53] how can we like kick miners out how can
[30:55] we like get rid of this thing entirely
[30:57] now the convers is almost flipped in
[30:59] that you know how can we as a country
[31:01] leverage Bitcoin to increase like you
[31:04] know our our um our Reserve assets like
[31:07] our ability to thrive as a country um so
[31:10] it's like the conversation is entirely
[31:12] flipped and looking at it from how can
[31:14] we actually benefit from this instead of
[31:16] how can we shut it out so I think that
[31:18] that is one of the most positive things
[31:19] that have come out of this is we see you
[31:21] know kind of world leaders looking at
[31:23] Bitcoin and seeing how they can actually
[31:25] use it for good instead of just how to
[31:28] we uh how do we get rid of this so
[31:30] that's that's really exciting to me to
[31:31] see that kind of um the story come
[31:33] around and how they're looking at it
[31:35] yeah I I I guess
[31:38] the I guess the implications are
[31:41] more more indirect like you you get the
[31:45] if if America actually buys Bitcoin and
[31:48] and this will probably impact the price
[31:50] and everything like the adoption cycle
[31:52] also um this indirectly pushes lightning
[31:55] adoption only because like there's money
[31:58] now coming in the system it flourishes
[32:00] the whole industry and and there for Al
[32:02] so all companies uh but it it doesn't do
[32:05] it directly it's kind of like an
[32:07] indirect uh sideway of that because I do
[32:10] see the unfortunately the the price of
[32:13] Bitcoin being the massive marketing tool
[32:16] and everything else is kind of coming
[32:18] coming towards that uh by by by its
[32:22] nature um where do you see kind of
[32:25] lightning headed you talked about like
[32:27] you see a massive growth ahead in this
[32:29] year in the next coming years uh where
[32:32] do you see that for
[32:33] lightning yeah I mean I think that you
[32:36] know the the way that we've been kind of
[32:37] talking with our our customers and our
[32:39] businesses is basically if you're moving
[32:41] kind of any amount of Bitcoin uh there's
[32:44] you have the opportunity of saving quite
[32:46] a bit of money and then also provide a
[32:47] better user experience by integrating
[32:49] the lightning Network um so we see that
[32:51] really resonating with folks and we
[32:53] think that that's going to you know
[32:54] really help uh the adoption cycle of
[32:56] really just understanding what is the
[32:58] business impact of lightning when when
[33:00] lightning was early it was always kind
[33:01] of the pitch was always just it's a it's
[33:03] cool like it's you know it's better it's
[33:05] faster but like you know there wasn't
[33:06] much pitch besides it was just really
[33:08] cool to integrate lightning because
[33:10] that's like the future of Bitcoin um but
[33:12] now I think that we're able to really
[33:13] point to very specific metrics on how it
[33:16] can actually impact you know your
[33:17] business how it can make you more money
[33:19] which is you know from a business
[33:20] standpoint that's what you know
[33:21] ultimately um really matters to them and
[33:24] so I think that that's going to help the
[33:25] adoption quite a bit by uh again having
[33:28] those like more players um in in the
[33:30] ecosystem you can move it you know to
[33:32] and from more more places and whatnot so
[33:35] that's going to be a really really big
[33:36] deal um and we think that uh there will
[33:38] be a lot of um I think advancements um
[33:41] coming so like you know stable coins on
[33:43] top of lightning for example by
[33:44] leveraging the taed assets protocol
[33:47] that's going to be I think an incredibly
[33:48] large unlock for the lightning Network
[33:50] and its growth um that's because you
[33:52] know stable coins are the most used uh
[33:56] for the most use you know use case for
[33:59] bitco or I'm sorry crypto in general
[34:01] today um where they've all been on like
[34:03] you know Tron and ethereum and all these
[34:04] other chains um but now we're able to um
[34:07] you know do that on top of Bitcoin and
[34:09] then the lightning Network which brings
[34:10] a huge amount of liquidity and a huge
[34:12] amount of usage into the network itself
[34:15] and so you're able to get like these
[34:17] benefits of the lightning Network which
[34:18] is you know near instant uh settlement
[34:21] and very very low to to zero fees on
[34:23] your transactions if you can do that
[34:26] with the largest use case for for you
[34:28] know crypto today that's that's
[34:30] incredibly massive and I think that that
[34:32] will really take um that will take the
[34:34] adoption of the network itself to a
[34:36] whole new level and also be S more of a
[34:38] trojan horse of getting people to
[34:39] actually start using lightning and
[34:41] Bitcoin by first you know kind of having
[34:43] stable coins come in and then they see
[34:44] the value and then they can start
[34:46] integrating with Bitcoin much more
[34:47] easily so that's I think a big Catalyst
[34:49] that we see coming up um for lightning
[34:51] adoption as well interesting Al Al the
[34:54] stable coins on lating is fascinating uh
[34:57] I mean I I do say I do see stable coins
[35:01] kind of like
[35:03] Blu-ray you know what I mean like we had
[35:06] in this like the Blu-ray discussion and
[35:08] then on top of that there might come uh
[35:11] there's the digital camera and Blu-ray
[35:13] was kind of like this this thing in
[35:14] between and I do see stable coins as
[35:17] exactly
[35:18] that yeah yeah I I think it'll be really
[35:20] interesting and like that's something
[35:21] that you know we're we're in the early
[35:23] Innings of as tether just announced
[35:25] they'll support it I think last last
[35:26] week or the week before
[35:28] um and so we're seeing um a lot of
[35:31] people being very very interested in it
[35:32] so I'm very excited to see where where
[35:34] that goes and I think it'll be a pretty
[35:36] big deal for the network yeah for the
[35:38] for for the lightning Network it's
[35:40] probably really cool that t looks looks
[35:43] at that but but but I do see like oh
[35:46] like if if we move towards like more of
[35:48] a Bitcoin standard I I see like all the
[35:51] extensions of feed and stable coins are
[35:53] for me like such an extension of that uh
[35:56] but it it definitely drives a lot of
[35:58] adoption in lightning which is
[36:00] ultimately also great for uh for for
[36:03] Bitcoin that that that's a really cool
[36:06] uh aspect of of of it it's it's
[36:10] interesting that they now move to to
[36:13] lightning I mean they have their own
[36:15] chain like how how does this even how
[36:17] does this even work with with with
[36:19] stable coins on Lightning it's a it's a
[36:21] it's a weird concept for me in my brain
[36:24] yeah definitely it I mean it's it's it's
[36:26] quite a unique concept and it's like the
[36:28] whole like from kind of the technical
[36:29] side it's all powered by the taer assets
[36:32] protocol which is was developed by like
[36:33] lightning labs and what that does is it
[36:36] basically allows you to verifiably issue
[36:39] assets on bitcoin the layer one and so
[36:42] you could you know the way that you know
[36:43] stable coins work generally is like they
[36:45] you know there's a company like a tether
[36:47] that has a bunch of like you know US
[36:49] dollars or something you know similar in
[36:50] a bank account and then they're issuing
[36:52] you know kind of a token on like
[36:54] ethereum or a salana or something that
[36:56] is backed by that dollar um you were
[36:59] basically able to do the similar thing
[37:00] with on with Bitcoin um leveraging tap
[37:04] rot um which is the most recent um
[37:06] upgrade to bitcoin and so by doing that
[37:07] you can kind of like have these
[37:08] verifiable proofs of which assets are
[37:11] where and all of those different things
[37:13] um and so you can now take that into the
[37:15] lightning Network as well and have that
[37:17] kind of same Assurance of verifiability
[37:18] of assets and all the all that inside of
[37:21] lightning and so um it's a pretty deep
[37:23] concept that you know there lightning
[37:25] Labs do a pretty good job of publishing
[37:26] some videos on on how it works and
[37:28] developer breakdowns and all those
[37:30] things that I would recommend anyone go
[37:31] check out but ultimately at the end of
[37:34] the day it's tap rot that enables this
[37:35] to be possible and having these
[37:37] verifiable proofs that can be um
[37:39] validated both on chain and in the
[37:41] lightning Network that allows us to have
[37:43] you know assets that are outside of
[37:45] Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network is it
[37:47] then also possible to
[37:49] like pay in uh a stable coin and
[37:52] directly convert that somehow to to
[37:55] bitcoin if it uh kind of integrates with
[37:57] the T ass it yeah that's a great
[37:58] question and yes like um that's the way
[38:00] that the the protocol is built in itself
[38:02] is that um uh there's things called like
[38:05] Edge nodes that can basically um do that
[38:07] conversion automatically as far as a
[38:08] payment goes so being able to like have
[38:10] a have a lightning invoice generated um
[38:13] maybe it's for um a tether invoice and
[38:16] being able to pay that invoice with
[38:17] Bitcoin and then vice versa generating a
[38:19] Bitcoin invoice and paying it with
[38:20] tether um that's all built into the
[38:22] protocol which is I think pretty unique
[38:23] and a pretty awesome um value
[38:26] ad yeah absolutely it could be because
[38:30] there's a lot of fear still around and
[38:33] uh I think it will be around for a long
[38:35] time still like for quite a long time so
[38:38] integrating Bitcoin as deep as possible
[38:41] with feat is actually good for for
[38:43] Bitcoin to uh Leverage The the whatever
[38:47] technology we have to get more uh volume
[38:51] Medi of exchange volume but also to
[38:53] Value volume uh to bitcoin I think
[38:56] that's that's uh I never looked at that
[38:58] like that way if if you like you you
[39:00] just have usdc or like USD or like some
[39:03] some form of stable coin and you're like
[39:06] oh like let's let's let's pay someone
[39:08] and the other one directly gets it in in
[39:10] Bitcoin or you can really quickly swap
[39:12] it without transaction fees or like
[39:14] without a conversion or exchanges or
[39:17] anything like that that it just makes
[39:19] the the whole industry probably a little
[39:21] bit better and more integrated I like I
[39:25] love the idea of that
[39:27] yeah I mean I agree I think it makes um
[39:29] a much more integrated experience and
[39:31] it's one of the really great things of
[39:32] like Bitcoin or the liting network has
[39:34] about 500 million dollars of capacity in
[39:36] it today that can all be used for stable
[39:39] coin movement you know right away and so
[39:41] it doesn't it it enables us to leverage
[39:44] the existing liquidity that exists in
[39:45] the network without having to stand up
[39:48] you know deploy another 500 million to
[39:50] be able to do stable coin movement um so
[39:52] it's really awesome because we can
[39:54] leverage the existing Network that we
[39:55] have and we don't have to create an
[39:56] entire new one so so like we we we can
[39:59] already use use that and and and kind of
[40:01] that's an interesting F also it's also
[40:04] the payment uh if is super interesting
[40:07] because is it also is it also possible
[40:09] to just like pay Bitcoin and the other
[40:12] one gets usdc or like the the other one
[40:16] that like you can also flip it probably
[40:18] on on its head are there any apps and
[40:20] and and stuff like that they already
[40:22] integrate voltage probably like how is
[40:25] the the E ecosystem from that
[40:28] perspective yeah I mean it's definitely
[40:30] um it's definitely early for the
[40:31] ecosystem as tether you know just kind
[40:32] of supported it anoun support just a
[40:35] couple weeks ago but um people like us
[40:37] like we're definitely adding support for
[40:38] tappered assets um there's people like
[40:40] jolts that are kind of a wallet SDK for
[40:44] um for taer assets I know that we have
[40:46] quite a few partners that are very
[40:47] interested in in adopting it so um it's
[40:49] early in terms of the the support but um
[40:52] we see that shaping up pretty quickly um
[40:54] and we're you know we are definitely
[40:56] working on our strategy for that as well
[40:58] yeah could could be an could be an
[41:00] interesting uh play point for for for
[41:03] Bitcoin because I'm also like I'm
[41:06] thinking of like uh pay um I'm I'm
[41:09] thinking like I'm getting now my first
[41:11] employees and and trying to figure out
[41:12] how how to to set this up uh and they're
[41:15] not all in the same region like me like
[41:17] the the first one that I'm I'm thinking
[41:19] about uh he's in Columbia uh and we and
[41:24] for him it's both possible Bitcoin uh or
[41:27] dollars but he said like dollars would
[41:28] be easier on his side uh so like getting
[41:32] uh dollars to him uh but maybe like if I
[41:36] can just send my Bitcoin and and he gets
[41:40] it directly in dollars in his his wallet
[41:42] like those use cases are super
[41:44] interesting for Bitcoin operating
[41:46] businesses where they can plug into some
[41:50] really nice thing uh some app where they
[41:53] get directly US dollar in in their
[41:55] wallets or like spendable US Dollars
[41:58] equiv equivalence uh and but you you as
[42:01] a Bitcoin business because I get my
[42:03] income in Bitcoin so I also want to pay
[42:05] in Bitcoin um you can just pay in
[42:07] Bitcoin a Bitcoin address and it kind of
[42:10] converts that I think those Integrations
[42:12] are super interesting for the let's say
[42:16] five 10 20 years to come because we we
[42:19] need those like there are some
[42:22] bitcoiners out there and say like oh
[42:23] it's Bitcoin or like ride or die with
[42:26] Bitcoin and don't want to touch feed at
[42:28] all so they're like very against stable
[42:29] coins they're very against anything that
[42:32] has fear all over it or like even crypto
[42:35] uh and I think in the mean medium term
[42:38] it's a mistake I think we have to be
[42:40] open to fear to integrate it and to kind
[42:43] of infiltrated like almost like a trojan
[42:45] horse to to fear and and I love those
[42:48] applications where we we kind of have to
[42:50] to to get in there we have to be the
[42:53] most open protocol we have to be the
[42:56] most open ecosystem because the most
[42:58] open ecosystem will win in the end
[43:01] that's why open source best better we we
[43:04] closed source and I I love the idea of
[43:08] that just I said that I think like five
[43:10] times now but I love I never heard that
[43:12] idea and I'm really fascinated by it and
[43:15] really excited to to hear that you're
[43:16] working on
[43:17] that yeah yeah absolutely I mean yeah
[43:20] we're very excited about it as well and
[43:21] I think that it'll it will unlock kind
[43:23] of a new phase of growth for the network
[43:24] in general and you know and that that's
[43:26] one of the great things about it is that
[43:28] you know if you want to use Bitcoin and
[43:29] never touch stable coins or anything
[43:31] like that you can totally do it it's not
[43:33] like you know a requirement to like
[43:34] support stable coins in Bitcoin as well
[43:37] so um I think that's that's a great
[43:38] advantage of anyone that doesn't want it
[43:40] um doesn't have to use it uh so I think
[43:43] it'll be a really good um unlock for the
[43:45] ecosystem and let a lot of people kind
[43:47] of choose what assets they want to move
[43:49] when and how and all those
[43:51] things really cool uh is there anything
[43:54] else that you're really excited about in
[43:56] in the ne future in in Bitcoin or or
[43:59] Bitcoin and or
[44:01] lightning yeah I mean I think that
[44:03] overall like we're just we're excited to
[44:04] go through this year and really um push
[44:06] the boundaries of of adoption and get a
[44:08] lot more um companies involved and then
[44:10] we we're got a a huge amount of kind of
[44:12] uh announcements and press releases
[44:14] coming up soon that we're really excited
[44:16] about as well and then finally we have a
[44:18] a new product that we'll be releasing
[44:19] the next you know month or two um that
[44:22] we're very excited about we're excited
[44:23] about all these things um but uh overall
[44:26] I think that there's not you know not a
[44:27] ton that we can share at this point but
[44:29] we have a lot of things coming down um
[44:31] the pipeline and it'll be a really
[44:33] really good year in 2025 and that's
[44:36] something that we are um excited about
[44:38] both from being able to increase the
[44:40] network as a whole get more people
[44:42] involved as well as some of the things
[44:43] that we've been working on for a while
[44:44] now uh super interesting uh one more
[44:47] thing that I want to get into the
[44:48] podcast is uh when do you see or like
[44:52] what event or like what has to happen uh
[44:55] in order to see him major spike of
[44:58] medium exchange right now it's still
[45:00] like a a small use case for for Bitcoin
[45:03] most bitcoiners just hold Bitcoin and
[45:06] and don't touch it and use like a feeld
[45:08] system to to do that uh what do you see
[45:11] as kind of the Milestones that has to
[45:13] happen for that to change that Bitcoin
[45:15] is really um used as a medium Exchange
[45:18] in a major way yeah I mean that's a good
[45:21] question I mean I think that um we so
[45:24] it's a couple things I think that one
[45:26] like it doesn't like the the whole
[45:27] medium of exchange I think is like
[45:29] people kind of tie medium of exchange to
[45:31] like to lightning specifically where I
[45:32] don't know you see that that is has is a
[45:35] requirement because there's people like
[45:37] you know people like exchange two
[45:38] exchanges transferring value and Bitcoin
[45:40] you know between each other that could
[45:41] be like $5 million payments you can
[45:43] still do that faster and cheaper than
[45:45] you can on chain there's still a huge
[45:46] amount of value in doing that um Alone
[45:49] um but then I think I think something
[45:50] like four it's a somewhat of a us-based
[45:53] answer but I think some of like the tax
[45:54] laws that are like very um unhelpful for
[45:58] like everyday spending like you know
[46:00] technically today in the US if you send
[46:02] if you pay for something with $5 doll in
[46:04] Bitcoin um you have to that's like a
[46:06] capital gains event you have to pay
[46:08] taxes on um extra taxes besides your
[46:10] sales tax on the conversion of when you
[46:12] bought the Bitcoin and then when you
[46:13] like transacted with it which is pretty
[46:15] kind of ridiculous um it's not actually
[46:17] it's very um I think that's one of the
[46:19] reasons why people have really not been
[46:21] very interested in in spending it in
[46:23] that way um because it's just the system
[46:25] isn't made to support that um I think
[46:27] that could be go a long way on
[46:28] increasing the mean the the exchange of
[46:31] of Bitcoin in kind of more everyday use
[46:33] cases and I think it's ultimately just
[46:35] Inc continuing to uh increase the amount
[46:39] of uh like the user experience of both
[46:42] lightning and like getting more people
[46:43] involved um making it easier and easier
[46:45] and easier to use um which is something
[46:46] we're certainly working on and then
[46:48] finally I think that the the like we
[46:50] were talking about with stable coins on
[46:51] Lightning I think that that's going to
[46:52] be a big unlock for getting it more used
[46:54] in a day-to-day where uh people might
[46:57] might start with stable coins on
[46:58] lightning and then ultimately move into
[47:00] Bitcoin as they start to see the value
[47:02] and like hey as as for my business I
[47:03] would love to be able to support start
[47:06] accumulating Bitcoin um and doing that
[47:08] because we see it appreciating over time
[47:10] so I think it'll it'll be a there's
[47:12] several kind of steps that we need to
[47:13] get to making it more and more
[47:14] accessible um I think that's been
[47:16] historically pretty hard for for all of
[47:18] those reasons but I think we're chipping
[47:19] away at them one at a time H that's
[47:22] that's that's super interesting yeah
[47:24] like we we we come we come closer and
[47:26] closer and like chipping uh chipping
[47:28] them away really interesting um one
[47:30] question I ask that I asked each and one
[47:32] of my guests is what can we learn from
[47:34] you besides Bitcoin that's a really good
[47:36] question I mean I think that I do I do
[47:38] uh quite a bit of just kind of the the
[47:41] startup um I guess mentoring and and
[47:43] education of just how do you build a
[47:45] company from zero to one and how do you
[47:47] how do you you know scale it and do all
[47:49] these different things um something I've
[47:51] I've learn learned about um uh over time
[47:54] um and then I think just you know I do a
[47:56] lot of of similar on just kind of
[47:57] software engineering um that's where my
[48:00] back I don't do much software
[48:01] engineering anymore because I I've kind
[48:03] of moved into more of the the business
[48:04] side of things but um I think um
[48:06] software engineering and building
[48:07] companies are things that I'm very uh
[48:09] interested in um outside of just Bitcoin
[48:11] specifically I uh I think I think
[48:14] building startups in Bitcoin is is quite
[48:16] unique with like the different hurdle
[48:18] rate of investors if someone invests in
[48:20] a Bitcoin startup they obviously get
[48:21] Bitcoin and a Bitcoin is a very
[48:24] attractive kind of cash resarch if you
[48:27] see it as a cash Reserve um uh what kind
[48:31] of interesting or unique things about
[48:33] investing in a Bitcoin startup or like
[48:36] the Bitcoin startup World in itself do
[48:39] do you kind of see in in in this in the
[48:42] space yeah I mean I think it yeah I
[48:45] totally agree and I think that that's
[48:47] it's it's it's honestly really
[48:48] challenging because like startups are
[48:50] already like risky and hard and all
[48:52] these things and when you add Bitcoin to
[48:54] it it makes it much harder and it makes
[48:56] it much more risky and all of these
[48:57] things because like you know as much as
[48:59] we all like love and like uh believe in
[49:01] Bitcoin it is still like you know
[49:03] especially to investors it's still very
[49:04] early and like you know how like what
[49:06] scale does Bitcoin ultimately reach is
[49:09] is it going to take over the world is it
[49:10] going to stay the same size like all
[49:12] these questions from like an investor
[49:13] standpoint are are very much in their
[49:15] minds and so um it it can be very
[49:17] challenging to run a Bitcoin company
[49:19] because you're kind of like doubling or
[49:21] quadrupling like the risk and like the
[49:23] all the considerations that need to go
[49:25] into it um so it's just it's it's
[49:27] challenging um but that's something that
[49:28] you know you you can work through in a
[49:30] couple ways of um you know in like a
[49:33] business model perspective or the way
[49:34] that you kind of pitch or talk about
[49:36] your company so there's some ways of of
[49:39] um increasing that or bettering your
[49:41] odds of getting funding or just becoming
[49:43] a successful business um but ultimately
[49:45] at the end of the day it is definitely a
[49:48] a challenge um and definitely a unique
[49:51] uh opportunity in building a company in
[49:53] Bitcoin um because it's just it's we're
[49:55] still new we're at bitcoin's 15 years
[49:57] old but we're still um figuring things
[49:59] out as we go there's still a lot of
[50:01] unknowns and stuff to build and so um
[50:03] there's an inherent um kind of risk if
[50:05] we were building things for like the the
[50:08] telecom phone systems that's a little
[50:10] bit more understood that's been around
[50:11] for many many years and I think that's
[50:13] really been um drisk in a lot of ways um
[50:15] we're doing something that's completely
[50:16] brand new and so there's a lot of risk
[50:18] that comes with that do do you have a
[50:21] lot of investors in in startups or do
[50:23] you see a lot of investors in startups
[50:25] that don't get bit Bitcoin to this point
[50:27] like do you see some some investors that
[50:30] want to invest in Bitcoin startups but
[50:32] but but are not into Bitcoin is is that
[50:34] even is that a
[50:36] thing um is a good question I think that
[50:39] I like we've seen um most investors at
[50:42] least like understand Bitcoin that want
[50:43] to invest in Bitcoin companies there's a
[50:46] lot of them that that don't only do
[50:48] Bitcoin they do like you know every
[50:50] other chain or they do a bunch of other
[50:52] just general crypto stuff and Bitcoin is
[50:53] just one of those opportunities inside
[50:55] of their broader portfolio um I haven't
[50:58] seen as many people that like completely
[51:01] don't understand Bitcoin or like just
[51:02] aren aren't that interested in it
[51:04] investing in the companies I think that
[51:05] there has to probably be some
[51:07] correlation there of people being like
[51:09] interested in Bitcoin and the value it
[51:11] brings and then investing in those
[51:12] companies that are kind of bringing it
[51:14] into the market yeah makes sense because
[51:16] like why would I invest in a Bitcoin
[51:18] company if I don't believe in Bitcoin
[51:20] it's like yeah if they work in Bitcoin
[51:23] it kind of doesn't make sense for me to
[51:25] invest if I it's like I I don't I don't
[51:29] believe in the internet but I invest in
[51:31] in in in Amazon it wouldn't make sense
[51:34] for me at all like if I don't think that
[51:35] the internet will get adopted uh really
[51:38] cool uh we have an end routine in the
[51:39] podcast where the previous guest is
[51:41] asking a question for the next guest
[51:43] without knowing who the next guest
[51:44] actually is uh the question is not
[51:46] limited to to bitcoin and today it's
[51:48] also not a Bitcoin question uh the
[51:51] question is what inspires you most on a
[51:53] daily basis um that's a good question so
[51:56] I think um I I think I would say it's
[51:58] two things um one is just I think like
[52:02] solving hard problems is like the thing
[52:04] that I just love to do and I think that
[52:06] bringing Bitcoin both starting starting
[52:08] a company scaling a company and then
[52:09] bringing Bitcoin into the world into
[52:12] Mass adoption are two incredibly hard
[52:14] problems to solve um and so those are
[52:16] things that I just I that really drive
[52:18] me every day is trying to solve problems
[52:20] I think that it's not only that but it's
[52:22] also solving problems that I think add
[52:23] value to the world I think that Bitcoin
[52:25] can actually add value to a lot of
[52:27] people's lives a lot of people's
[52:28] businesses it can be a huge amount of
[52:30] opportunity and solving hard problems
[52:32] for kind of that that good of of
[52:34] changing people's lives or or making
[52:36] things better for particular people is
[52:38] is very interesting so I'd say that's
[52:40] kind of one of the things that really
[52:41] drives me is just solving problems um
[52:43] that's what I love to do and then the
[52:45] second one I would say is just my family
[52:46] I mean my family is the thing that has
[52:48] driven me um through uh the entire kind
[52:51] of Journey of starting a company and
[52:53] whatnot and um just doing it for them is
[52:55] also a big a big driver that uh inspires
[52:58] me to continue to go absolutely really
