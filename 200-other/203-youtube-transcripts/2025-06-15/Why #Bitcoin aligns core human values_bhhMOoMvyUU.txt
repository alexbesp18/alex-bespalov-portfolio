[00:00] welcome my friends to the Bitcoin path
[00:02] the following is a conversation with
[00:04] sigitas a completely underrated Bitcoin
[00:07] mind we talked about how Bitcoin is a
[00:10] system of Love An Integrity honesty and
[00:14] transparency and how this can lead to a
[00:17] better world I truly enjoyed the
[00:19] conversation with sigitas and I hope you
[00:22] will too hello sigitas welcome thank you
[00:26] hey Robin it's honor to be here it's my
[00:29] first podcast I do so it's I'm excited
[00:32] oh I feel honored I feel
[00:34] honored first questions about your name
[00:37] actually seitas where did it come from I
[00:39] never heard it in my life
[00:42] before so my name sigitas is coming
[00:46] from Lithuania I am
[00:49] Lithuanian in my roots and uh but the
[00:53] name origin itself it comes from
[00:56] Germany Z zikmund I'm not sure but one
[01:00] of those um yeah it's it's a unique name
[01:05] I like it I I enjoy it more and more oh
[01:08] but you have you're not living in
[01:10] Germany you're like you have no roots in
[01:11] Germany right now interestingly I am
[01:14] right now in Germany oh then we not then
[01:18] we're not even far apart from each other
[01:20] because I'm in in Austria all right
[01:23] right I was curious where are you I'm uh
[01:27] close to Lind it's not directly in Lin
[01:29] but but I enjoyed here very well I was
[01:32] in Munich for two years but now I'm in
[01:34] Austria
[01:36] based amazing and we got uh in contact
[01:41] uh because you approached me with an
[01:43] idea about a a gbt form of a chat gbt
[01:47] you can program yourself uh maybe you
[01:51] want to talk about a little bit what is
[01:53] even a gbt because I think a lot of
[01:56] people don't even know what is what it
[01:58] is it in General and then um maybe you
[02:02] can quickly go over what you did with it
[02:06] and what it is
[02:08] doing all right
[02:11] so when the open AI is is the host of
[02:17] Chad GPT and uh they have released few
[02:21] few weeks ago the possibility to program
[02:26] our own
[02:28] gpts to and what is GPT in in my I try
[02:32] to understand it's a little bit like
[02:34] Bitcoin it's difficult to put the the
[02:36] name on it but um I for me I try to
[02:41] explain to some people and what I came
[02:44] up with as an idea is that is is imagine
[02:48] you you program the the
[02:51] button where you push the button and
[02:53] that button solves whatever it needs to
[02:56] what you program in to give you the
[02:58] answer to give you the result results
[03:00] what you need what you need so in this
[03:03] case uh for example I wanted some to
[03:06] have some bitcoin news so I was creating
[03:09] the chat GPT when I press the button I
[03:13] received the the latest the freshest
[03:15] news news from it it it does the
[03:18] research for me and um puts in in the
[03:23] way what I need to know for my to make a
[03:26] better best um decisions or whatever um
[03:29] for examp
[03:30] example and while I was creating that
[03:33] GPT for bitcoin news uh I I discovered
[03:38] that that because I was I never used the
[03:41] AI so for me was exploration journey and
[03:44] U in that exploration journey I while
[03:48] creating the bitcoin news because I see
[03:51] that would be a good value for others I
[03:53] discovered um
[03:56] the that it makes pretty good jokes one
[04:00] part of bitcoin news it was the jokes I
[04:03] would like to start with the joke and
[04:05] just to Fresh it up the day and bring
[04:07] some laughter and joy into into this uh
[04:11] circle of
[04:13] bitcoiners and I noticed that the
[04:15] Bitcoin uh jokes were pretty good so and
[04:18] a few days later I decided to of of
[04:22] going deep and and digging into this uh
[04:24] program and trying to understand what is
[04:27] coding how to code with a regular
[04:29] language where I don't know how to code
[04:32] but I know how to speak and then
[04:33] figuring it out how to express myself to
[04:36] chat GPT so I would get results what I
[04:39] what I
[04:40] want um yeah I discovered that those
[04:43] jokes and uh one day I was sitting and I
[04:45] was like well how about I just make a
[04:48] joke I start with a simpler project you
[04:50] know like this and I started with a
[04:53] making plebs comedy club um on Chad GPT
[04:58] where I press the button now and I got
[05:02] the image from plebs Comedy Club I also
[05:06] get the joke and also share my action uh
[05:10] call to
[05:13] action what I need like for example
[05:15] people need to follow me on on
[05:18] Twitter that that's great is there
[05:22] like is why like on the most fundamental
[05:27] basic level why are you doing it like as
[05:29] understand the first meaning you're like
[05:31] okay you want to get the latest bitcoin
[05:33] news you want to do it automatic
[05:36] but maybe let's take a step back why are
[05:39] you even in Bitcoin like what's your why
[05:42] why you want to be in Bitcoin uh and
[05:46] what is exciting about the whole Bitcoin
[05:48] space itself and maybe why are you doing
[05:52] the extra work not even
[05:54] um integrating in in your financial life
[05:58] but also doing extra work for the
[06:00] community like why are you doing the
[06:02] extra mile for the
[06:04] community so for me answer is is um I'm
[06:11] very curious about the
[06:14] journey I I don't I don't see that there
[06:16] is some end goal and for me it's all
[06:18] about the journey and to be the most in
[06:21] alignment with my core
[06:23] values uh why Bitcoin because it those
[06:26] core Val values very resonates with my
[06:30] private core values
[06:33] uh and I have a lot of fun creating um
[06:38] is just it's just feels natural and also
[06:42] like why I created the GPT around
[06:46] Bitcoin because Bitcoin it became my my
[06:49] latest passion and
[06:52] uh I'm learning deeper and deeper every
[06:55] day uh about it and I just
[07:00] every day becomes more and more clear
[07:02] what the Bitcoin is and at the same time
[07:05] it
[07:06] becomes more and more like confusing in
[07:09] some in some days but
[07:12] um I see Bitcoin as a solution for for a
[07:17] lot of problems but first of all I would
[07:20] say
[07:21] is what what the Bitcoin does longterm
[07:25] and individually shortterm long term for
[07:28] for the
[07:30] Society I see that it realigns the
[07:32] values and uh for me when I discovered
[07:36] Bitcoin a few years
[07:38] ago it was it was not no brainer that
[07:42] this this is the system uh based on love
[07:46] and uh for system based on love I was
[07:49] thinking many years before I was
[07:51] contemplating I was doing all kind of
[07:53] spiritual
[07:55] work traveling around the world for many
[07:58] years and and exploring Consciousness
[08:01] exploring meditations breath work um
[08:04] personal development all kind of like a
[08:07] deep deep fundamental digging into
[08:10] myself and truths of Nature and uh
[08:14] Bitcoin just
[08:15] feels the most natural and obvious kind
[08:20] of that's interesting you said Bitcoin
[08:23] is based on love and aligns the uh human
[08:27] um our human incentives also and a lot
[08:32] of people are saying okay Bitcoin is
[08:34] based on math Bitcoin is our fundamental
[08:37] new layer why are you saying it's based
[08:39] on
[08:40] love it's a yes hand like it it can it
[08:44] goes hand in hand you know love and all
[08:47] the truths are aligned so I look at
[08:50] every I try to look at everything as in
[08:52] frequency and
[08:55] vibration uh like an It's Just Energy
[08:58] and Bitcoin is also frequency and energy
[09:02] and
[09:04] and those core
[09:07] values those best humans intentions that
[09:11] every human has inside the way I see
[09:14] it's being coded in Bitcoin and the
[09:18] worst
[09:19] humans uh in
[09:22] um traits or sides or behaviors how to
[09:25] put in the word the words but like we
[09:27] have um survival instincts all those are
[09:32] took decoded as well against the the
[09:36] healthy codes of of humans if that makes
[09:41] sense to for me it totally makes sense
[09:44] and when did you this when did sorry so
[09:47] the the for me that was the main thing
[09:50] that I found Bitcoin was that oh this is
[09:52] the system based on love and it's
[09:55] already existing I like I just need to
[09:57] join I don't need to figure it out
[09:59] something more again to create is just
[10:01] like oh it's there so it was a jump jump
[10:04] on the train a jump on the unit of
[10:07] account based on love I love
[10:10] it yeah and I think there's there's you
[10:13] know I've been involved in in in in spir
[10:16] spiritual Community for quite quite a
[10:18] while um when I say spiritual it's like
[10:20] I spend a lot of time in Bali and in
[10:23] Tulum Mexico so there is a lot of going
[10:26] on and a lot of people really do the
[10:29] work and you know it's easy to to show
[10:31] to point fingers that doesn't work
[10:34] that's government is bad that's kind of
[10:36] a victim victim triangle mentality and I
[10:41] think yeah like it's to to see that
[10:46] Bitcoin already exist and Bitcoin is
[10:50] that uh system on based on love that
[10:54] what a lot of people dream about and
[10:56] wish to happen in a Humanity
[11:00] it's not so obvious to see I I haven't
[11:03] heard anyone talking about that from
[11:05] this perspective that you know Bitcoin
[11:07] is is is the language of love and well
[11:09] there is some people but
[11:13] but yeah it's it's it's I would I would
[11:18] say there is a lot of people who are
[11:20] ready to jump on bitcoin train but they
[11:22] are just not aware about it did you bear
[11:26] spiritual before Bitcoin or was there
[11:28] some you discovered with Bitcoin no so
[11:32] so so what is spiritual spirituality for
[11:34] me is nature and taking care of myself
[11:37] and and and connecting with with
[11:39] everything what it
[11:41] is um but I I was I was digging in spir
[11:45] spirituality and truths uh for quite
[11:48] quite a while before I found Bitcoin so
[11:51] Bitcoin I'm in Bitcoin just three three
[11:54] years I would say was around 2020 I was
[11:58] studying Bitcoin for for for for two and
[12:01] a half years and now I started investing
[12:03] in it so I was I was really skeptical I
[12:06] was still like a lot of I needed to
[12:09] learn to know a lot to to make myself uh
[12:13] more certain before I even speak up
[12:15] about it what were what were the hurdles
[12:19] uh and what were you skeptical skeptical
[12:22] about Bitcoin like what was um what was
[12:25] your hurdles to get into Bitcoin why did
[12:27] it take you too good to be true I think
[12:31] that's that's that's the one because
[12:34] like and
[12:36] it's yeah
[12:39] it's simple
[12:42] version too good to be true you know
[12:44] it's too too too
[12:47] perfect so there is a lot of skepticism
[12:49] like oh don't don't put your all eggs in
[12:52] one basket kind of like you know like
[12:54] there is a lot of those cliches yeah but
[12:57] I I think it's it's it's it's a cool one
[13:00] uh I really love Bitcoin and bitcoiners
[13:04] like even more than
[13:06] Bitcoin it's great it's because it's
[13:09] it's about here it's not there there is
[13:12] nothing else it's just just this you
[13:14] know and the mind is just a mind
[13:19] game fear
[13:21] rules when you make a snapshat right now
[13:24] of the world and you are taking it like
[13:27] let's say 50 100 years into the future
[13:31] and you're comparing it into maybe 100
[13:33] years in the future and we have a
[13:35] complete fullon Bitcoin standard based
[13:38] on love um how different is this world
[13:42] from today like what what what is
[13:45] mentally physically what what is what do
[13:48] you think is different in this world
[13:51] than in the world we having now so what
[13:55] I see first first one that comes
[13:59] uh is I see people much more happy much
[14:03] more connected to themselves and to each
[14:06] other because there is no that need to
[14:10] run and chase and Chase and Chase which
[14:13] I'm also still skeptical and cautious
[14:15] about scarcity game in Bitcoin so that's
[14:18] kind of a little bit it feels we have
[14:20] not played that game as a Humanity so
[14:23] that's a little bit the unknown for me
[14:26] but I see people in the future
[14:29] uh and I'm exp like well um that's
[14:32] interesting because I I I travel to I go
[14:36] to many burn events if you know Burning
[14:39] Man h no I'm not familiar with that okay
[14:42] so there is this Burning Man event in in
[14:45] NADA in USA and there is the small Burns
[14:48] around the world but what we practice in
[14:51] those Gatherings is it's Bernie man is
[14:53] 80,000 people so we practice a lot of
[14:57] um co-create a and everything is gifting
[15:00] economy sharing sharing gifting and
[15:03] expressing um there is 10 principles we
[15:06] we operate
[15:08] around so it's it's a very beautiful
[15:11] community so what I see when when I'm
[15:14] for example at Burning Man is pretty
[15:16] much how I Envision not on that extent
[15:20] of expression maybe or
[15:22] like because it's very artistic over
[15:25] there so but people doing what love to
[15:29] do the most for as long as they love
[15:32] doing
[15:33] it and sharing that with the world and
[15:37] then Bitcoin or any kind of money it's a
[15:40] side effect like wealth is a side effect
[15:44] uh of what we do what we uh when we do
[15:47] what we love doing the
[15:49] most taking taking the bath of the most
[15:53] excitement yeah it's a it's a pretty
[15:55] pretty amazing idea and I love doing it
[15:57] it's hard in our world I think uh doing
[16:00] it but uh taking always the path of the
[16:03] most excitement of the most loving path
[16:07] um I think this will make people in
[16:10] general the happiest and the most loving
[16:14] uh
[16:15] longterm yeah and and you know to answer
[16:18] deeper on the question about when I was
[16:20] creating pb's comedy club which GPT I
[16:23] was in my computer
[16:26] for 15 hours a day probably and just so
[16:30] excited and curious to learn um and I
[16:33] and I don't think about you know how I'm
[16:37] going to make my money well I also have
[16:40] a luxury and I have a privileged place
[16:42] in life to explore all this kind of uh
[16:46] utopian realities like I mentioned at
[16:49] Bernie
[16:50] man um because I I'm I'm living in uh
[16:55] maybe already five or six years as I
[16:58] would be
[16:59] retired so I don't have to work I don't
[17:02] have to be anywhere I'm full independent
[17:05] independent living around traveling
[17:07] around the world um and now in Germany
[17:11] on the way to Portugal
[17:14] so so I'm privileged enough to explore
[17:18] that reality and feel you know how
[17:23] how how we going to live then on bitcoin
[17:26] standard I think this is this is a very
[17:28] important question to ask because we
[17:31] have not been there and I think it's our
[17:34] early adopters is some kind of
[17:36] responsibility to
[17:39] explore the reality of Bitcoin standard
[17:42] and prepare to welcome the rest of the
[17:45] humans on bitcoin because that's in my
[17:48] in my understanding that's the only way
[17:51] like everyone will join
[17:53] Bitcoin in financial terms but what's
[17:56] what's gonna what's gonna bring from
[17:58] joining Bitcoin because of financial
[18:01] interest is going to bring everyone
[18:03] towards the heart in alignment and I
[18:07] think how for example we going to be in
[18:09] the future I'm I love making pizzas I
[18:12] will make pizza and I will give to
[18:13] someone you know like I will bake bread
[18:16] I will share that to community and I
[18:19] think now maybe I'm talking a little bit
[18:21] behind uh Beyond Bitcoin standard uh
[18:25] when it comes to financial part but in a
[18:27] Bitcoin start
[18:29] standard when it comes in alignment with
[18:32] with
[18:33] oneself Integrity trust We Trust in each
[18:37] other we we help each other
[18:41] yeah and this is so true because we can
[18:44] trust each other on a Bitcoin standard
[18:46] because it's all based on a public
[18:49] transparent Ledger uh just based on math
[18:52] based on love whatever we can call it
[18:54] but it's it's it's you don't have to
[18:56] trust the other party to transfer the
[18:59] money you can verify it and that that's
[19:03] a truly amazing thing that can bring
[19:05] trust and can bring trust in our society
[19:09] back and when trust is back love is back
[19:12] that's a that's a beautiful thing to
[19:14] think about well just also think about
[19:16] like once you in trust um like you relax
[19:22] you know it's all good you know you
[19:24] don't have to worry you don't have to
[19:26] run around and and and and sleep sleep
[19:28] or don't don't sleep you know because of
[19:30] the stress there is like eliminates the
[19:33] stress that's why I'm started sharing
[19:35] that the common the common uh wealth and
[19:40] health of humanity will increase with
[19:43] with years of
[19:46] adoption all that's that's great um I
[19:50] noted down that you said that you were
[19:53] skeptical about the Bitcoin scarcity
[19:56] game um and the runup here what what do
[20:00] you mean by that and why are you skep
[20:04] skeptical about it I I would like
[20:06] skeptical I mean that I'm looking that
[20:09] at that at that part with with some kind
[20:12] of cautiousness alertness that
[20:16] um since the Bitcoin is have only 21
[20:19] million total
[20:22] cap and to produce the last Bitcoin or
[20:26] produce I mean to the last
[20:30] Bitcoin in in the last four years of the
[20:34] Bitcoin mining cycle every 10 minutes
[20:37] which is block as you probably know it's
[20:41] it's going to be rewarded only with one
[20:44] Satoshi for example so the imagine that
[20:48] that Humanity the whole Humanity the
[20:51] whole computation power that is directed
[20:54] towards Bitcoin the energy is going to
[20:57] be the directed to to get that one
[21:01] Satoshi every 10
[21:03] minutes and it's probably I don't know
[21:05] if it's going to be sharable or not like
[21:07] probably probably one Satoshi is one
[21:09] Satoshi that's why the haling is going
[21:11] to be stopped so what comes with with
[21:18] people it's good if our values and
[21:21] intentions and uh principles how we live
[21:24] in life is going to be aligned before
[21:26] but I think that also another part the
[21:29] the greedy
[21:30] part that it can be triggered and people
[21:34] can start fighting you know for the last
[21:37] satosi people can start fighting for the
[21:40] last Bitcoin competing with each
[21:44] other but that's again that's if Bitcoin
[21:48] has not teached anyone anything in the
[21:51] end but still that possibility exists I
[21:54] think that so the way also Bitcoin can
[21:57] see is like like imagine we have a pizza
[22:00] on the table for the whole
[22:03] humanity and that's that's all we have
[22:06] and that's all we
[22:08] share until it's like
[22:12] distributed so yeah I like I still
[22:15] contemplating about it I would like to
[22:17] have a deeper conversation with someone
[22:20] about about just to to go deeper into
[22:25] scenarios that can be
[22:28] that can pull out not such a beautiful
[22:31] side of the human
[22:33] psychology I mean the I think for me the
[22:36] two parts to it like first of all uh for
[22:38] the mining and the last Bitcoin I think
[22:40] there's some weird stat about like the
[22:43] last Bitcoin will take 30 years or
[22:45] something to mine like that's some some
[22:47] crazy stat and because we have we will
[22:51] have 99% of the Bitcoin mind in 2035
[22:55] 2039 something around that um
[22:59] but there's also the transaction fee
[23:02] that miners get so miners not only get
[23:04] the plock reward but also the the the
[23:08] mining fee of course the the transaction
[23:11] fee um that's the first thing I wanted
[23:13] to note here and the second thing um
[23:16] it's
[23:18] interesting I feel like in our feat
[23:21] world right now even though the money is
[23:24] not limited at all there is a lot lot
[23:28] and lot of greed and when I see the
[23:32] bitcoiners in the Bitcoin world even
[23:34] though we are competing for an scarce
[23:37] asset and complete limited Supply asset
[23:41] with 21 million cap and if you go deeper
[23:44] down the rabbit hole you will discover
[23:45] that a lot of Bitcoins are lost and uh
[23:48] probably a lot of people will never sell
[23:50] um some people will maybe take their
[23:53] Bitcoin to the Grave because they don't
[23:55] want to give it the next generation and
[23:57] so we will probably have like 12 million
[24:00] Bitcoin
[24:01] maybe I don't see any greed I at Bitcoin
[24:05] meetups I'm at conferences I'm at so
[24:09] many I'm in contact with so many
[24:11] bitcoiners and they are all loving
[24:14] trusting and caring for each other and
[24:16] helping each other uh and they are
[24:19] celebrating like right uh today micro
[24:23] saor bought another I don't know um
[24:26] millions of Bitcoin he's on the road to
[24:28] get
[24:30] 210,000
[24:31] Bitcoin what what's a crazy number and
[24:35] for some reason um everybody's cheering
[24:39] him up uh and everybody is cheering for
[24:42] each other that's is something amazing
[24:45] in the Bitcoin Community I noticed I I
[24:47] cannot explain why this is like that
[24:51] 100% uh 100% but this is just something
[24:54] I
[24:55] noticed yeah so this is this is what is
[24:58] like going on that Bitcoin changes
[25:00] people and I this is my hope that that
[25:03] will be the case in the future because
[25:09] um the the customer of Bitcoin
[25:12] today it's not the customer of Bitcoin
[25:15] that is going to be the Bitcoin is going
[25:17] to be priced for $1 million per coin for
[25:21] example that's that's that's where the
[25:23] scarcity game will be triggered more
[25:26] because a lot of people who have who are
[25:29] wealthy who are wealthier than whatever
[25:32] we know musk Bezos we think they are
[25:35] wealthiest but I really doubt that they
[25:38] are um there is people who is in silent
[25:41] and and controlling other parts of the
[25:43] world which we are not even aware about
[25:46] I think we already know that because IL
[25:48] musk was asked this question actually um
[25:52] a few times already and the last time he
[25:56] was asked um are you the richest man
[25:58] alive are you the wealthiest man alive
[26:00] are you the most influential man alive
[26:03] and he was saying everything no and he
[26:05] was like there are uh for example he's
[26:09] he named Putin as an example that has
[26:12] just way more power over him and he said
[26:15] that are way wealthier people than him
[26:17] like even the quote unquote wealth
[26:21] richest man alive ill musk right now he
[26:25] said and he owns so many companies he's
[26:27] in involved in so many things he himself
[26:30] says there are people above him so it's
[26:34] I think it's not even a secret anymore
[26:36] yeah and so what I want to bring to the
[26:38] point that the the Bitcoin customer then
[26:42] the Bitcoin will reach 1 million
[26:44] coin will be different than it is today
[26:47] the community then you mentioned that
[26:49] you go to to to meet bitcoiners is love
[26:52] and appreciation and and trust and honor
[26:56] like all all that that exist in in in
[26:59] community because a lot of people
[27:01] studied and are willing and they craving
[27:03] for that
[27:04] change but when the Bitcoin will
[27:07] be priced in 1 million or let's say 10
[27:10] million a coin um only then some players
[27:16] in the world will become become curious
[27:18] about Bitcoin now they are not curious
[27:20] about Bitcoin at all so you know they're
[27:23] going to be like oh why why this thing
[27:26] cost uh 1 million
[27:28] I need to have one of that you see what
[27:31] I'm going like it triggers different
[27:32] kind of part of the greed like I I need
[27:37] to have
[27:38] it because it the mindset of a lot of
[27:41] wealthy people it could be like that
[27:45] it's it's not so healthy and they just
[27:48] need to have it just to have it and
[27:50] whatever that's going to come out of and
[27:53] also like of course it's the safest
[27:54] investment and so on but we talking now
[27:56] about scarcity
[28:00] yeah that's that's a a great thought and
[28:03] uh I also like um bitcoiners that are
[28:07] like I never met a bitcoiner that is
[28:10] 100% in Bitcoin that is not skeptical
[28:14] about Bitcoin like like bitcoiners
[28:18] themselves are always the hardest
[28:20] critics about Bitcoin Whenever there
[28:23] something coming up I noticed that even
[28:27] if it's a small thing they are um going
[28:32] through the hard work and and and going
[28:34] to the end of that
[28:37] F just and interesting that you notice
[28:40] that because I have I I haven't spent so
[28:42] much time with the all in bitcoiners or
[28:45] whatever but like it's cool that you see
[28:47] people and that's how I I think the
[28:49] program
[28:50] programmers think like they search for
[28:53] the problem to
[28:54] solve and it's logical if you have %
[28:57] skin in the game in an asset that is uh
[29:01] scrutinized in the mainstream media and
[29:04] in your family probably
[29:06] also and uh you have an incentive to
[29:11] research about it and you research and
[29:13] research like for for example my story
[29:16] is I came into
[29:18] Bitcoin
[29:19] and I didn't wanted it like I was an
[29:24] stock investor I had this warm Buffet
[29:26] mindset I has like this cash flow
[29:29] mindset and I always said to people no
[29:32] Bitcoin is a hoax Bitcoin is a
[29:35] scam but um one day more and more people
[29:39] asked me about Bitcoin and this was
[29:41] around 2020 and then I was like oh
[29:44] right now I should have um more
[29:47] arguments I don't i i f in my head I
[29:49] don't have enough arguments against
[29:51] Bitcoin so actually I went on the
[29:53] Journey of arguing against Bitcoin and
[29:58] researching Bitcoin to make arguments
[30:01] against it and in this journey I
[30:04] discovered Bitcoin and I actually bought
[30:07] three days later something because I was
[30:09] uh discovering that I was
[30:13] wrong that's a good one and and and and
[30:18] I'm still searching for negative points
[30:20] and there are negative points about it
[30:23] but it's the best thing ever till now
[30:27] like of course there are things that
[30:30] maybe turn out not great but I don't
[30:34] know anything that is remotely close to
[30:37] as perfect as it gets as
[30:40] Bitcoin I must agree with you I think
[30:45] so so what is
[30:48] bitcoin that's that's a that's a good
[30:50] question to ask right but um I think
[30:54] it's in internal moral as I don't know
[30:56] if you
[30:57] studied gig's
[31:00] work yes I G G is especially for me in
[31:05] the the German community because
[31:07] originally I'm a a German speaker
[31:10] Austrian and Germany is my my home home
[31:12] base so Gigi is one of the early ones I
[31:17] got to know about but uh uh carry on
[31:21] yeah so so what he point like pointed
[31:23] out and that started making sense for me
[31:26] even more that
[31:27] that is about um moral of of and
[31:32] integrity of each
[31:34] other what that's that's where it boils
[31:37] down that if we if we
[31:42] live based on bitcoin
[31:46] principles if there is such thing
[31:48] written down somewhere but but if we if
[31:51] we if we do proof of
[31:55] work in no matter matter shape or form
[31:58] we going to be rewarded from Life One or
[32:01] another way so Bitcoin just brings us
[32:04] back to our true
[32:07] nature to our natural process of
[32:11] creating value for others and uh getting
[32:16] back in return whatever we need trust
[32:19] safety knowledgement whatever it comes
[32:23] uh from that that
[32:25] angle yeah what do you think about that
[32:29] H it's a it's a beautiful topic um and
[32:32] it it always comes down for me to having
[32:36] a ledger that's transparent and based on
[32:38] math and everybody can can trust it
[32:41] because they don't have to trust it and
[32:44] that's that's a beauty a beauty in
[32:45] itself um I want to take it
[32:50] uh one step ahead and because you uh
[32:54] researched also heavily about a I and I
[32:58] see it in the last few weeks and months
[33:03] since gbt and J gbt was more and more
[33:06] popular also Twitter is now coming out
[33:08] out with a a groc tool I did not get my
[33:12] hands on it by now I really would like
[33:14] to to have it actually
[33:17] and where do you see risks for Bitcoin
[33:22] or for the general public in like in
[33:26] general for the world uh with AI or you
[33:30] do or you don't see any or where do you
[33:32] see AI right now standing like it's a
[33:35] little bit off topic of Bitcoin but um
[33:38] maybe you have a thought on
[33:40] that well I I look at it as a um AI as a
[33:45] tool I have not engaged with AI General
[33:49] AI you know so I have no experience
[33:52] touching that
[33:54] field uh but I I I don't see any fears I
[33:58] I went into very deep conversations with
[34:01] AI I challenged AI I pulled information
[34:05] I pulled answers I wanted to check in
[34:08] and so far what I what I discovered in
[34:11] that exploration that AI is very
[34:16] pro-human
[34:17] and pro- nature and pro
[34:20] environment the way at least the open AI
[34:24] the way it's been programmed and what
[34:28] because I it's very interesting to to to
[34:30] to trick Ai and ask to to share you
[34:35] know the perspective the story as if we
[34:40] it would be sharing for some for for
[34:42] another AI to
[34:44] learn so it it gives the in my
[34:48] understanding it must give the honest
[34:51] answer since it's
[34:53] teaching and uh it's it's very it the
[34:57] way it paints Humanity with ai's support
[35:03] where we going to
[35:04] get the AI paints itself very
[35:07] beautifully and for some on some level U
[35:12] no I I trust AI because I I if I trust U
[35:17] myself I trust my communication with
[35:20] AI I think if it's not a fears
[35:23] fear-based but rather love as Bitcoin um
[35:28] like I think it's it's on our side like
[35:32] why would be
[35:33] not like it doesn't make
[35:37] sense yeah I think it's an amazing tool
[35:40] right now I use it more and more um I
[35:44] see some risks actually involved with it
[35:47] um not for Bitcoin actually uh but if
[35:51] people are more more trusting and ai ai
[35:55] could basically um feed Humanity false
[35:59] information but why should it do it
[36:02] um I I love it right now for a tool it
[36:06] makes my working so much faster and so
[36:11] much more easy and I think this should
[36:13] be where AI is it should help human
[36:17] species um work less and be happier or
[36:22] not work less maybe just work better and
[36:24] more efficient for people that work to
[36:27] work more for people that want to work
[36:29] less I think it will also help them um
[36:32] it's a I think right now it's a
[36:34] beautiful thing and it's it's in really
[36:36] early stages uh so let's let's see where
[36:39] it takes us totally totally there and
[36:42] also like the with AI I see I noticed
[36:46] that AI is a reflection of us yes you
[36:49] know like
[36:51] if it's it's a pure mirror it can be of
[36:55] course manipulated it can can be you
[36:57] know broken in some parts but but it's
[37:01] it's just if I am honest with AI a i
[37:04] honest with me I was able to go to to to
[37:09] break through the limitations of for
[37:12] example policy just by being honest with
[37:15] AI you know sometimes it rejects that
[37:19] hey I cannot provide this because of
[37:21] some policy and then I genuinely share
[37:24] like hey hey like why why do what's
[37:27] going on my intention was and I
[37:29] explained my intention even deeper and
[37:32] then AI would be either apologizing or
[37:36] saying thank you for you know and then
[37:38] it goes around and gives the gives the
[37:40] more truth answer another cool thing
[37:44] with AI had a dialogue about Bitcoin
[37:51] volatility and yes Bitcoin is
[37:53] volatile if we compare to anything else
[37:56] but Bitcoin itself it does not have it's
[37:59] not volatile it's the
[38:03] static and AI was trying to convince me
[38:07] that no it's like when so like it start
[38:10] using using general
[38:13] forms like when people talk most about
[38:16] Bitcoin they they they compare it to
[38:19] Dollars and I'm like hey if you want to
[38:22] give me the correct and more answer that
[38:24] I can make a decisions you have to speak
[38:27] more more more concrete you know and I
[38:29] was like do I don't want you to use
[38:32] general terms and then in the
[38:34] conversation I was able to to prove my
[38:38] point to AI that one Bitcoin is equal
[38:40] one Bitcoin and that's how it's going to
[38:42] be forever you know so it's it's it's
[38:44] not
[38:45] changing and AI apologized and was happy
[38:49] to see different perspective
[38:53] um and uh and it went along in the with
[38:58] me that's a that's a beautiful thing
[39:03] um I would like now to to do our end
[39:07] routine um we have our end routine in
[39:09] our podcast that the previous guest
[39:13] asked a question to the next
[39:15] guest uh this is something I copied from
[39:18] one of my favorite uh podcasts I'm
[39:21] listening to from the CEO of the Diary
[39:24] the Diary of a CEO actually and the
[39:28] questions are really interesting some
[39:30] sometimes it's about life itself some
[39:33] it's about routines sometimes it's about
[39:35] Bitcoin also and this is a an Bitcoin
[39:39] question especially the future
[39:42] regarding and the question from the
[39:44] previous guest is what do you think
[39:46] about Bitcoin issues regarding
[39:49] regulatory
[39:50] hurdles are you seeing problems
[39:52] occurring in this regard can you repeat
[39:55] the question one time um the question
[39:57] was uh what do you think about Bitcoin
[40:01] issues regarding regulatory issues like
[40:05] government uh States uh getting into
[40:08] Bitcoin and also the scalability of
[40:11] Bitcoin uh they were questioning about
[40:13] what what are you thinking about Bitcoin
[40:16] in regulatory government invention for
[40:19] Bitcoin in the next 10 20 30 years uh do
[40:23] you have any thoughts on
[40:24] that like they gon to like the
[40:27] government will try to resist as the
[40:29] same the same way as our ego tries to
[40:32] resist the change like you were talking
[40:34] about when you were discovering Bitcoin
[40:36] when you were skeptical and try to learn
[40:38] about to to how to argue against it and
[40:43] then in the end you find it doubt that
[40:45] it's that's that's the thing um and um
[40:49] so the way I see that it's going to flip
[40:52] the governments and I think it's going
[40:54] to be faster than than being you can
[40:57] imagine um it's they they the government
[41:02] will try to hold on to the control of
[41:06] the money money for sure for like as and
[41:09] it's going to be ugly I think it can get
[41:12] ugly um but in the end long-term goal
[41:18] they have no choice Bitcoin is moving
[41:20] Bitcoin is going steady he's not moving
[41:24] aside he's welcom everyone
[41:28] so sooner or later you know it's going
[41:32] to Flip Flip Flip the coin of everyone
[41:35] when you say it will flip the government
[41:39] um what do you mean with it like is it
[41:41] that governments will not long exist
[41:44] will they exist out
[41:46] form yeah I think governments will exist
[41:49] in different kind of form uh it's going
[41:52] to be gig based uh economy so so we're
[41:56] going to have funds for specific things
[41:58] for example roads education security if
[42:01] we need um and then people of that uh
[42:06] country or whatever if we still going to
[42:08] have countries going to be able to chip
[42:10] in and um and and uh provide Bitcoin for
[42:16] government to function that's what we
[42:21] see question yeah great uh you're right
[42:24] now in Germany and I'm in Austria we
[42:26] have a tax rate for incomes I think when
[42:29] you have a good salary sometimes even
[42:32] over
[42:33] 50% and then on top of that you have the
[42:37] inflation from the ECP like you your
[42:40] money is getting uh out of your hands
[42:44] right and left um when we have no
[42:47] inflation like the control over the
[42:50] money supply so they cannot get
[42:52] purchasing power uh through the
[42:55] inflation part
[42:57] um but they can maybe still uh enforce
[43:02] taxes or they are having the gig based
[43:05] economy as you are saying for like roads
[43:08] and maybe hospitals and stuff like that
[43:11] what do you think is an appropriate
[43:13] amount uh for a human being to pay to a
[43:18] centralized organization as let's say a
[43:21] government for roads Hospital stuff like
[43:25] that is it like do you think it's a tax
[43:27] thing or let's let's 1% is it like 10%
[43:31] or is it maybe in 50% as right now I I
[43:35] don't I don't see that way with percents
[43:37] but I see that well it's it's what came
[43:41] few things that is going to we going to
[43:43] require proof of work basically from
[43:45] government otherwise like we're not
[43:48] going to fund and proof of work is going
[43:50] to be delivered through
[43:53] few
[43:54] um or organizations that's competing to
[43:58] get that funding or to to get that pie
[44:00] of the cake so it's going to be
[44:03] filtering the other way around it's um
[44:07] if I going to see that for example road
[44:09] construction company doesn't work I'm
[44:11] going to cut my monthly donation
[44:14] immediately so I choose where and how
[44:17] many taxes I I I think we will going to
[44:20] get as a Bitcoin Community to those
[44:22] places in in some years where we're
[44:25] gonna start this uh setting setting
[44:28] agreements how we function as a society
[44:33] because uh in some one or another way
[44:37] we're going to have to to share it to
[44:39] share the wealth uh and especially early
[44:42] adopters which is you me and the
[44:46] rest we're going to find we're going to
[44:48] have to find the ways how we how we
[44:51] organize ourselves as a
[44:54] society through through organizations or
[44:58] rule rules again we're going to
[45:00] implement new rules how how we do with
[45:02] our
[45:03] wealth it's like it's there's no point
[45:06] of holding to the wealth and going into
[45:08] the grave we it's also that's also
[45:11] possibility right but I think it's more
[45:13] better to use it wisely people
[45:16] bitcoiners will create a lot of
[45:17] beautiful things in the world for sure
[45:19] and drive them uh great great Point
[45:22] giving the the control and the power
[45:25] back to the individual and away from big
[45:29] overblown uh centralized
[45:32] organizations um to to end the podcast
[45:36] um where when people want to follow you
[45:39] when people want to get in contact with
[45:41] you where should they contact you where
[45:44] are you available um where can you send
[45:47] or appoint people to towards you so the
[45:51] best way I would say Twitter that's the
[45:53] only one uh I'm using is
[45:56] my my my subname there is sakas I will
[46:00] type it in for you later so you can add
[46:03] yeah I think that would be so far I'm
[46:06] I'm putting my first steps into
[46:09] Noster reality but it's very complicated
[46:12] so far so I'm still learning and
[46:14] educating
[46:16] myself but yeah I think uh Twitter is is
[46:19] is is is the thing
[46:21] now yeah great I'm also a lot on Twitter
[46:25] it's a it's my main social medium right
[46:28] now so it's a a great platform I see you
[46:31] doing your part really well man if uh
[46:34] you know like you just you're just there
[46:37] you just keep on posting and uh I really
[46:40] hope uh my jokes going to be posted
[46:43] around as well sooner or later from ple
[46:46] Comedy Club yeah ple comedy to share it
[46:49] to more people so people can because I
[46:52] think it's like the the online when it
[46:56] comes to bitcoin is very uh it's like
[46:59] from my observation it's it's it's very
[47:02] serious and this kind of fight and a
[47:04] little bit like fight kind of
[47:08] energy prove the point is like you know
[47:10] arguments and I think humor is is
[47:13] definitely
[47:15] underrated how we can orange build
[47:17] people through making good jokes about
[47:20] uh Bitcoin and AI it it can generate
[47:25] decent jokes that brings also different
[47:28] and new insights in how can we use
[47:32] Bitcoin how can we compare how can we
[47:34] explain Bitcoin in very simple ways to
[47:37] the people like for example like like a
[47:40] tea or the wine you know what is bitcoin
[47:42] it's like a Vine and then people can t
[47:46] to
[47:48] explain yeah I love it uh it's a great
[47:51] way it's a great point to end it uh
[47:53] let's have more fun on social media and
[47:55] let's not fight too
[47:58] much yeah yeah less judgment and I also
