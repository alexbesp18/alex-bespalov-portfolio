[00:00] the the story of the bamboo tree it
[00:02] takes like years to to build the
[00:04] infrastructure and then in a matter of 6
[00:06] months it shoots up 100 ft in the a
[00:08] Bitcoin within the next 10 years is
[00:11] going to be priced in the millions that
[00:13] might be an underestimation of of How
[00:16] High this thing could actually go
[00:17] because we've never seen absolute
[00:19] scarcity before we've never seen the
[00:21] explosion of the current Global debt
[00:24] economy when it's being pinned and
[00:27] gauged by an absolute fixed Global
[00:30] decentralized digital asset I was 100%
[00:33] in Bitcoin but I still wanted to buy
[00:35] more Bitcoin so I figured you know what
[00:37] the company has money we have that
[00:39] number set the 6 months working capital
[00:41] and anything beyond that we just buy
[00:43] Bitcoin with it and send it to Cold
[00:45] Storage four years later it has worked
[00:47] wonders for us and it was probably the
[00:50] best decision we've ever done in our
[00:51] lives two businesses that are exactly
[00:54] the same they bring in the exact same
[00:55] Revenue exact same profit margins but
[00:58] one has t of Bitcoin that they've
[01:00] accumulated over the years and one has
[01:02] no Bitcoin at all which one would you
[01:04] prefer people in the west Europe North
[01:07] America they live in this bubble and
[01:08] they think that oh everything that's
[01:10] happening over there that's just over
[01:12] there that could never happen to
[01:17] us before uh we get started for the
[01:20] people that don't know theis like myself
[01:23] a little bit because I'm in Europe um
[01:26] what is the heis what are you doing how
[01:28] big is it what's give the audience a
[01:30] little bit of a a feeling what what the
[01:32] size of the business and what the
[01:34] business is
[01:35] doing yeah absolutely so uh we are a uh
[01:39] canadian-based uh franchise restaurant
[01:43] franchise company and uh we opened our
[01:48] first restaurant in London Ontario in
[01:51] 2012 uh from there we started slowly uh
[01:55] building the infrastructure of the
[01:58] franchise system um we expanded to two
[02:01] locations then three then four uh in in
[02:05] the year 2020 we were at um we were at
[02:09] three and um now we're at uh 44
[02:15] locations nationwide uh so we got 44
[02:19] locations um in Canada across the
[02:23] country uh so it's kind of like the the
[02:26] story of the the bamboo tree it takes
[02:29] like years to to build the
[02:30] infrastructure and then in a matter of 6
[02:32] months it shoots up like you know 100
[02:35] feet in the
[02:36] air um so that's kind of um the story of
[02:40] the company we serve Middle Eastern uh
[02:44] SL Fusion food uh so we make uh mainly
[02:48] shawarmas but we've also um found a way
[02:52] to infuse other
[02:54] cultures uh into our food so for example
[02:58] we have like a butter chicken shawarma
[03:01] which is like you know Indian Cuisine
[03:02] and Middle Eastern cuisine infused
[03:05] together we have Jamaican Jerk Shawarma
[03:08] um we have like crispy chicken Sharma
[03:11] sandwich right uh Sharma poutin so uh we
[03:15] figured out a way to to infuse other
[03:19] cultures and which makes us unique and
[03:22] uh which gives us the ability to create
[03:26] um food products that are only exclusive
[03:28] to tahinis and no one else um which is
[03:32] one of the reasons why uh people love
[03:34] our our
[03:36] food and um yeah and then in the year of
[03:41] 2020 uh we made a very bold move
[03:46] to um put the company on a Bitcoin
[03:50] standard by putting our entire cash
[03:53] reserves into Bitcoin at that point um
[03:58] so yeah yeah and then fast forward four
[04:02] years here we are today really really
[04:05] cool I love that um by the way like I
[04:08] just got
[04:11] hungry probably some some fers you can
[04:14] grab something for food I will I will
[04:15] grab something later um maybe we can do
[04:19] a second round in a restaurant someday
[04:21] would be a cool interview um why did you
[04:24] decide to to do H Bitcoin stand and
[04:27] although 2020 is an interesting time
[04:28] because yeah like uh probably at your
[04:31] place uh restaurants also were forced to
[04:33] close down uh it's an interesting uh
[04:37] place to start with your Bitcoin Journey
[04:40] how was that time in general and and why
[04:42] did you then uh decide to put uh Bitcoin
[04:45] on your balance sheet yeah so it was an
[04:47] interesting time for us actually so when
[04:49] 2020 hit uh we were fortunate enough um
[04:53] to be one of the businesses that uh
[04:55] wouldn't be forced to close down uh we
[04:58] closed down our d area but we
[05:01] were uh able to keep uh our takeout and
[05:05] delivery business still going so uh
[05:09] obviously within that first week of of
[05:13] uh the pandemic in March uh sales
[05:18] dropped like 80% in one week um because
[05:22] of all the scare and everybody was
[05:24] afraid nobody know knew what was going
[05:26] on and and uh so did the market
[05:30] and I was at the time a participating uh
[05:33] market player and I was I had a lot of
[05:37] you know dry powder uh in my Arsenal so
[05:40] I decided to deploy that Capital uh into
[05:44] just everything so mainly stocks I put a
[05:48] lot of money into stocks and and then I
[05:52] just decided to put a little bit of
[05:54] money into Bitcoin as well I've at that
[05:57] point I've heard it multiple times I
[06:00] didn't really know what it was but um I
[06:03] just said you know why
[06:05] not but then after I bought it that's
[06:08] when the real journey started I feel
[06:10] like that's where most people's journey
[06:12] start is after you buy it and then you
[06:14] start studying what it actually is
[06:18] deeply uh you then well I after that I
[06:23] just got hooked down the rabbit hole and
[06:26] um it was like a a three months
[06:29] obsessive phase of just uh consuming and
[06:34] and learning and reading everything I
[06:36] can about Bitcoin uh and then the more I
[06:40] read the more I learned the more books I
[06:42] read and podcasts I listen to uh the
[06:45] bigger my allocation personally was so I
[06:49] kept like and I ended up like selling
[06:52] all of my stocks just buying more
[06:55] Bitcoin with it uh until it was just I
[06:58] was 100% in Bitcoin and at that point I
[07:03] was uh out of money but I still wanted
[07:06] to buy more
[07:07] Bitcoin so I figured you know what the
[07:11] company has money and we have been
[07:13] saving some money as a treasury uh in
[07:16] the company and you know I talked to my
[07:21] partners I was able to convince them
[07:23] to uh put that money into Bitcoin and it
[07:28] was there was some debates going back
[07:31] and forth and then Michael sailor came
[07:35] out with his announcement when he did
[07:37] his first buy um I can't remember the
[07:41] amount I think it was like 125 million
[07:43] or something like that and that
[07:46] announcement was what pushed us over the
[07:48] edge and we said you know what this is
[07:51] the right move to do so we jumped all in
[07:54] like a week after Michael sailor
[07:56] announced his his buy and and um we've
[08:01] been just buying ever since um we put a
[08:06] a pin the pin tweet on our Twitter
[08:08] account sort of explains the methodology
[08:11] behind why we did it uh all the money
[08:15] printing all the you know how money cash
[08:18] is eventually going to be worthless and
[08:21] and the reasonings behind why we did
[08:24] that and from there we just kept buying
[08:30] in
[08:31] increments uh every month or every
[08:33] quarter uh a chunk of Bitcoin adding it
[08:36] to our reserves and that became our um
[08:40] Bitcoin like our treasury
[08:43] strategy um from that point on and four
[08:47] years later it has worked wonders for us
[08:51] and it was probably the best decision
[08:53] we've ever done in our
[08:56] lives yeah it's it's uh along the the
[08:59] capital appreciation is is massive since
[09:02] since 2020 um I'm a little bit curious
[09:06] uh before we get into how and everything
[09:09] like that um what was the debates like
[09:11] with your partners do you mean with
[09:13] Partners the franchisees uh that take
[09:16] the franchises or like from the business
[09:18] investors or what was the partners and
[09:20] and how did those debates uh go yeah so
[09:24] no by Partners I mean the partners in in
[09:27] the like the the franch company um which
[09:31] is basically my brother and my cousin uh
[09:34] we are three Partners uh running toah
[09:37] heis and I was the one that sort of
[09:40] discovered Bitcoin and I you know as I
[09:42] went down the rabbit hole I pulled them
[09:44] down with me and I had them buy Bitcoin
[09:48] personally and uh from there that's
[09:53] that's who the discussion was with um
[09:56] the the franchisees themselves are
[09:59] almost like separate in a way uh
[10:02] separate entities uh separate
[10:04] corporations than ours um so they have
[10:08] the decision they see what we do and
[10:09] they have the decision whether or not
[10:12] they want to buy or they don't want to
[10:14] buy um some of them do uh buy Bitcoin
[10:18] and and earn it
[10:19] through um like Bitcoin ATM machines and
[10:22] programs that we've
[10:24] developed uh but um but mainly it's our
[10:29] our franchise company like the the
[10:31] parent company really really cool bitco
[10:34] is an interesting one I want to get to
[10:35] that later a little bit uh before how
[10:38] was that transitioning time I guess like
[10:41] now it's an obvious choice right now
[10:44] like it's like oh yeah we do it now four
[10:46] years it's it's it's a great play but
[10:48] how was it in the beginning was was that
[10:50] transitioning uh with taxes accounting
[10:54] uh it was 2020 not too many uh publicly
[10:57] come uh not too many companies did it
[11:00] now it seems like a lot of companies
[11:02] have already played that Playbook how
[11:04] easy or hard was the transitioning time
[11:06] so from a tax perspective and accounting
[11:09] perspective I I uh I don't really have
[11:13] much to say because we didn't sell any
[11:15] Bitcoin so we didn't incur any taxable
[11:18] events um as long as you're just buying
[11:21] Bitcoin um you don't have to worry about
[11:25] that at all um that question sort of
[11:27] arises when when you want to sell it um
[11:30] so I guess I'll have to look into that
[11:34] more when we actually decide to sell
[11:36] some uh however recounting wise um
[11:41] managing how much you buy as a business
[11:44] uh can be a little tricky um especially
[11:47] when you feel the fomo right you have to
[11:51] have discipline uh when you're managing
[11:55] a company so that you're not eating into
[11:57] your working capital uh company in our
[11:59] cars can can have like surprise expenses
[12:04] and um you know we got payroll and we
[12:08] got any all the expenses that come with
[12:11] just running a company uh so the way we
[12:13] did it was we have six months of working
[12:17] capital uh we decide what that is we
[12:21] include uh a provision for uh some extra
[12:25] cash if we would need it and that just
[12:29] get stored as cash and then everything
[12:32] outside of that that is our Bitcoin so
[12:37] that's basically the way we do the
[12:39] accounting for it uh so we have that
[12:42] number set the six months working
[12:44] capital and you know it's a variable
[12:47] number it also grows as the company
[12:48] grows however uh we know that number and
[12:52] then anything beyond that we just buy
[12:55] Bitcoin with it and send it to coold
[12:57] storage i l that a lot is that the main
[13:00] difference uh between buying Bitcoin
[13:03] privately because like privately you
[13:05] might have a b you might have a family
[13:07] but uh you you don't have to be as
[13:09] cautious as with with the with the
[13:12] business where there are a lot of
[13:13] payrolls a lot of Li uh lot of
[13:16] responsibilities involved is that the
[13:18] main difference between buying as a
[13:20] private Ali versus buying Asis I would
[13:24] say so however like the principle is
[13:26] still the same because even if you're
[13:28] buying person personally um your family
[13:32] and yourself you guys have expenses and
[13:34] you need to calculate for all of these
[13:37] expenses over whatever period you decide
[13:41] three months four months six months and
[13:44] have that cushion uh just in case for
[13:46] emergencies and um and then anything
[13:50] beyond that that's that's the money that
[13:52] you should be investing because you want
[13:54] to invest in a way whether it's
[13:56] individually or in a company where
[13:58] you're not a force
[13:59] seller uh of Bitcoin at any
[14:02] time
[14:04] so like for example for me personally I
[14:07] went through a period you know over the
[14:09] last four years where I was sort of like
[14:11] tight on on uh cash and I didn't have to
[14:17] sell any Bitcoin to um fix that because
[14:21] I had some cushion available for
[14:23] emergencies like that and that's that's
[14:27] the ultimate goal you want to be um and
[14:30] thank God I was able to calculate that
[14:32] way because that was a time when uh
[14:34] Bitcoin was like at the lowest low of
[14:38] the bare market right I think it was
[14:41] like at 20,000 or something like that so
[14:44] uh it's I think it's personally I think
[14:45] it's wise to account for these uh events
[14:50] so that you can really take advantage of
[14:53] Bitcoin superpower and Bitcoin
[14:55] superpower is not you know paying for a
[14:59] coffee bitcoin's superpower is um saving
[15:03] for your
[15:05] retirement and that's the way I see it
[15:08] at least that's interesting uh there's
[15:11] also like when you discussed with with
[15:13] the foral and I think uh no matter if
[15:15] you're a company or like an individual
[15:17] you get a lot of foral H I think Michael
[15:20] sa even described it that like once he
[15:22] figured it out he got a real big foro
[15:25] because he's like oh when I can
[15:26] figure it out all the CEOs can figure it
[15:28] out really quick
[15:29] um and then you get into the the
[15:32] situation where like okay if I can
[15:34] borrow some money or I can borrow money
[15:36] against my future cash flows or against
[15:39] my assets that I have um then I can buy
[15:41] Bitcoin now if it shoots up the next few
[15:43] years how do you see that like how do
[15:45] you do you think that's a good decision
[15:48] whether it's from business perspective
[15:50] or private perspective uh did theis ever
[15:53] consider that or do that uh I mean
[15:55] Michael sa I know does something that's
[15:58] over my head what he does with the notes
[16:00] and and with the loans like I have no
[16:02] clue what he does I just see that he
[16:04] Stacks more more Bitcoin uh but how do
[16:07] you think about that powering to topic
[16:10] as a company or as an individual I mean
[16:12] Michael sailor talks about that very
[16:14] eloquently um I think if you're if you
[16:18] believe in something and if you love
[16:21] something um
[16:23] enough um you can figure out a way to
[16:26] take a smart leverage and that's the key
[16:29] word here is smart leverage and uh use
[16:34] it to buy Bitcoin so an example for
[16:36] smart leverage um is you know taking a
[16:40] fixed uh loan a fixed rate loan from the
[16:44] bank through um maybe like putting your
[16:48] company or your or your home as
[16:51] collateral
[16:53] um rather than taking a credit card loan
[16:56] that's like 30% and could go up with the
[16:59] increase of interest rates
[17:01] or uh or a loan that could be uh margin
[17:05] called um if if things hit the fan and
[17:09] you know you end up being a for seller
[17:11] at the worst possible time that's where
[17:14] people get wiped out the most uh so we
[17:17] try to stay away from these uh things um
[17:21] partly because not comfortable um with
[17:25] the risk at this stage of our company we
[17:28] have a lot of families take care of we
[17:30] have a lot of responsibilities um we
[17:33] believe in Bitcoin 100% but um uh we're
[17:37] trying to just be more conservative from
[17:40] that end um personally though it's a
[17:43] different story so yeah I mean it I
[17:47] think it's a it's a good idea if you're
[17:49] playing it smart and for the long term
[17:53] um but for your business it really
[17:55] depends on your tolerance risk and your
[17:58] your confidence in in that
[18:01] strategy probably also a majority of the
[18:05] business question like micro strategy
[18:08] has
[18:09] already proven so long that they can
[18:12] have the cash flow and they have such a
[18:14] big business model with so many
[18:16] different uh diversifications so like
[18:18] that's that's way easy plan and and also
[18:20] they like 50 accountants and Tax
[18:23] Consultants that that have through that
[18:25] decision uh which is exactly yeah that's
[18:29] a very good point because like you know
[18:31] with a with a small business like ours
[18:33] uh there's a risk that our our business
[18:36] uh can can go through a tough time and
[18:38] and you know we wouldn't be like if we
[18:40] would take um a debt that we wouldn't be
[18:43] able to service at a tough time uh it
[18:46] could be catastrophic for a small
[18:49] company like ours um where Michael
[18:52] sailor's uh micro strategy was a stable
[18:56] cash cow that was generating income at a
[18:59] steady base with a you know with a
[19:01] slight small increase year-over-year
[19:04] but um nothing too risky about the cash
[19:08] flows uh so that's something else that
[19:10] you're absolutely right should be into
[19:12] consideration when you're making a
[19:13] decision like that now to the fun part
[19:17] um you said that buying Bitcoin in or
[19:20] like putting Bitcoin on the as a reserve
[19:23] asset like on a balance sheet in 2020
[19:26] was an amazing decision for you and for
[19:27] the company um why is that like what
[19:30] what did tahinis gain uh from that yeah
[19:33] so I mean you can just open the chart if
[19:37] you guys are watching uh or listening uh
[19:39] to this podcast uh open a chart and look
[19:43] back to the year 2020 um August and
[19:46] before August like Bitcoin was at
[19:49] $10,000 is um at that period and now
[19:53] it's at almost
[19:56] $60,000 uh the the
[19:59] this thing is crazy and I'm of the
[20:02] belief that this thing will
[20:04] continue uh getting crazier and crazier
[20:08] because um it's just math right it's
[20:11] it's you know when you really study it
[20:13] and go down the rabbit hole you realize
[20:15] that uh absolute scarcity has never been
[20:19] invented before which means we still
[20:22] don't understand how massive this this
[20:27] thing truly is right um Jeff Booth which
[20:32] is a friend of mine um gives an example
[20:34] of
[20:35] a you know how people don't understand
[20:39] exponential change right and he gives
[20:42] example of like if you bring a a A4 size
[20:45] of paper right and this paper you can
[20:49] only technically you can only bend it
[20:51] like 11 times before it gets too hard to
[20:54] to fold but theor theoretically if you
[20:59] could fold it 50 times on itself uh how
[21:04] high would that piece of paper B and he
[21:08] was saying most people answers most
[21:11] people answer like you know maybe from
[21:13] here to the ceiling or or this much or
[21:16] or whatever and the true answer is from
[21:19] here to the
[21:20] Su and I think that is how we should
[21:25] look at Bitcoin we don't truly
[21:29] understand how big this thing can get um
[21:32] as bullish as I am I think Bitcoin
[21:35] within the next 10 years is going to be
[21:38] priced in the
[21:39] millions uh within that's within our
[21:42] lifetimes right that's uh that is might
[21:46] be an underestimation of of How High
[21:49] this thing could actually go because
[21:52] we've never seen absolute scarcity
[21:53] before we've never
[21:56] seen explosive the the explosion of the
[22:00] current Global debt
[22:02] economy when it's being pinned and
[22:05] gauged by an absolute fixed Global
[22:10] decentralized digital asset so when you
[22:13] just start thinking about these these
[22:15] things um and and you say oh yeah it
[22:18] could be you know priced in the millions
[22:21] within 10 years it could be priced way
[22:23] more than that and and that is what's
[22:27] going to protect you
[22:29] your family your business your
[22:33] organization and
[22:35] uh probably your your grandchildren as
[22:39] well right uh we live in a we live in a
[22:42] time
[22:43] where people are getting screwed by
[22:45] central banks and let's be honest here
[22:49] that's that's just that's been happening
[22:51] for uh centuries and it's nothing new
[22:56] and will continue to happen for the
[22:58] future until we die and until our
[23:01] grandchildren's die
[23:04] and up until this moment up until 2008
[23:08] um there was nothing for the regular
[23:11] folk like you me everyone M billions of
[23:14] people all over the world to fight that
[23:17] to stop governments and central banks
[23:20] from stealing from us to go fund Wars
[23:22] and whatever they want to fund and this
[23:26] is a way to protect yourself
[23:30] uh even from the strongest entity out
[23:33] there and uh it's something that
[23:36] everybody should think about because we
[23:39] come from a world where we've seen what
[23:42] capital controls is like we've seen um
[23:46] people break into banks with guns not
[23:50] robbing the bank but demanding the bank
[23:53] that they' give them their money right
[23:55] and that's Lebanon for you just a year
[23:57] ago right we we came from a world where
[24:00] my
[24:02] parents had money in Egypt and they
[24:06] couldn't they wanted to retire here in
[24:08] Canada they could not move their money
[24:10] from Egypt to Canada their money was
[24:12] stuck for about five years and in those
[24:15] five years the Egyptian pound got
[24:17] devalued
[24:20] 65% so people in the west Europe North
[24:25] America I feel like they they they live
[24:27] in this bubble
[24:29] and they think that oh everything that's
[24:32] happening over there that's just over
[24:34] there that can never happen to
[24:37] us
[24:38] and we've just seen the devaluation of
[24:42] our currency in just in the last four
[24:44] years against pretty much
[24:46] everything um and you know what comes
[24:50] after that is just we've seen it it's
[24:52] more devaluation eventually Capital
[24:55] controls eventually you know you can
[24:58] spend on your money on this but not on
[25:01] this and eventually everything collapses
[25:05] and people tend to just deal and
[25:08] transact on in the real
[25:10] Market what what is called the the black
[25:13] market but the black market is real
[25:14] Market you know and the black market is
[25:18] where um people end up just choosing a
[25:21] different kind of money and that pretty
[25:25] much coincides and confirms
[25:29] uh Gram's law which is you know money
[25:32] tends to flow to the most scarce and
[25:36] hardest money so that's our two cents
[25:39] it's a bit Gloom but
[25:41] hopeful gloom and doom in the sense that
[25:44] there's more theft and more um inflation
[25:48] and more Capital controls and more
[25:50] interest rate hikes on the way and the
[25:53] interest rate hikes are going to hurt a
[25:55] lot of people but it's going to also
[25:57] come with the basement that's the next
[25:59] part that we haven't seen if you look at
[26:02] I mean Argentina or Egypt or Lebanon all
[26:04] these places have like interest rates of
[26:06] like 20% or higher and and with de
[26:11] basement right so imagine that happening
[26:14] in in Europe I think eventually you will
[26:17] we get there so there's a lot of Doom
[26:20] and Gloom people need to know about it
[26:23] they need to be
[26:24] prepared they they need to think from
[26:27] first principles they they need to think
[26:30] that this could happen to them and it
[26:32] probably will and they need to see and
[26:37] find a solution and hey if you don't if
[26:40] you don't want to believe me that
[26:41] Bitcoin is solution go do your homework
[26:44] find something else good luck I hope
[26:47] you're you're right and you're
[26:49] successful I found Bitcoin we've all
[26:52] found the Bitcoin Community has been
[26:53] screaming
[26:55] this you know for years for decades
[26:59] and some people were were just got got
[27:00] here earlier than others and
[27:02] and if you're going to be you know if
[27:05] you don't want to believe that good luck
[27:08] to you and um wish you all the best if
[27:11] you watch or listen to my podcast on a
[27:14] regular basis I'll guess you already
[27:16] bought some Bitcoin and now the most

[28:28] I have something completely new for you
[28:30] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[28:34] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[28:37] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[28:40] look at that beauty I love it so much
[28:43] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[28:46] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[28:49] way to go out there and show that you
[28:51] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[28:55] Bitcoin only make sure to check out the
[28:57] link in the description for this amazing
[29:00] coin vigilante time pieces those watches
[29:03] are amazing I love them so much it was
[29:05] really hard for me to pick the one that
[29:07] I want to have because there are a lot
[29:09] of great options I went with the new
[29:12] transparency Edition they're all limited
[29:15] so grab yours those will not be
[29:17] available for a long time but there will
[29:19] come new models and new amazing designs
[29:22] along the way it's interesting because I
[29:24] think you have an amazing Insight in
[29:27] like what that could bring uh for for
[29:30] for small businesses um let's make that
[29:33] experiment what do you think happens to
[29:36] small and mediumsized businesses when
[29:38] they just operate in the Fiat system or
[29:41] maybe even with your uh uh restaurant uh
[29:45] franchise what would have happened to
[29:47] tahinis um without Bitcoin and why do
[29:52] then and like why do then businesses
[29:55] struggle so much we'd just be a lot
[29:57] poorer right
[29:59] eventually like I there's a lot of
[30:02] people that say oh Bitcoin fixes
[30:03] everything Bitcoin is not going to fix
[30:05] your your your business skills bitcoin's
[30:08] not going to fix your marketing skills
[30:10] or operational skills or you know your
[30:13] your financial accounting and management
[30:16] for the company skills right it's not
[30:18] it's not going to uh make your company
[30:20] successful but it'll make it'll give
[30:22] your company capital and capital is is a
[30:27] source for which you can use it
[30:31] to do anything you can use it to hire
[30:36] experts you can use it
[30:38] to buy assets to the company you can use
[30:42] it to buy technology to the company um
[30:45] you can use money for anything so if you
[30:47] want to have two businesses that are
[30:51] exactly the same operation wise they
[30:54] bring in the exact same Revenue exact
[30:57] same profit
[30:59] margins but one has ton of Bitcoin
[31:03] that they've accumulated over the years
[31:04] and one has no Bitcoin at
[31:06] all which one would you
[31:09] prefer easy easy Choice definitely one
[31:12] with the Bitcoin absolutely did you
[31:14] orange pill also already other
[31:16] businesses and and and Founders and how
[31:18] does it got I I'd like to think so I
[31:21] feel like we've influenced more people
[31:23] online and on Twitter than in actual
[31:27] real life
[31:29] um we've orange pilled uh almost
[31:32] everybody in the tahinis
[31:34] headquarters um so all of our employees
[31:38] and all stuff like that
[31:40] we uh we do incentive programs within
[31:43] the company using Bitcoin right so when
[31:45] we do contests and parties and games and
[31:52] and like you know um achievements when
[31:55] we want to reward achievements uh
[31:58] usually use Bitcoin to to sort of reward
[32:01] that and then over time we started doing
[32:04] that like in small amounts you know and
[32:07] it's small amounts like you know $20 in
[32:09] Bitcoin here $20 there like little
[32:12] things like that over time you see you
[32:15] know I see like all the employees they
[32:18] come up to me and they're like Ali like
[32:21] my bitcoin's now this much my Pi was now
[32:23] this much and it's pretty awesome to
[32:25] watch um I think
[32:28] just from experience like giving people
[32:31] Bitcoin um is one of the best ways to
[32:34] Orange fill them it doesn't work every
[32:37] time because some people lose it
[32:39] unfortunately I've I've seen that uh
[32:42] firsthand a lot of times but a lot of
[32:46] times it does work and a lot of times uh
[32:49] you give somebody some Bitcoin and they
[32:51] follow it and they see it go up and
[32:53] they're like oh this thing is
[32:54] interesting and they do their homework
[32:56] and they figure out how to buy more and
[32:58] then they buy more and then and then
[33:00] they come back and ask you about it or
[33:03] they come tell you hey we made a lot of
[33:04] money on it which is uh pretty nice I
[33:07] can understand why bitcoiners in the
[33:10] early days used to give out a lot of
[33:12] Bitcoin uh at first I thought man these
[33:15] guys are so dumb why would they get out
[33:18] like all this Bitcoin but at that times
[33:20] it's their way of of you know marketing
[33:24] Bitcoin and and advocating for Bitcoin
[33:28] and and you know trying to get their
[33:31] friends and family into Bitcoin so I get
[33:34] it
[33:35] now yeah it's interesting I asked two
[33:37] days ago Max Kaiser um if he's
[33:40] regretting uh giving away Bitcoin
[33:42] because he did it from like 2011 12
[33:45] onwards where like Bitcoin was like you
[33:48] you could give away to a friend like a
[33:51] thousand Bitcoins and it would not
[33:52] really make a difference uh and it's
[33:55] it's an interesting he's like uh it's
[33:57] it's amazing to see the joy now in their
[34:00] lives and how the lives improved and how
[34:03] amazing that worked for them but he's
[34:06] like yeah yeah I regret that it's
[34:08] like a lot of money that he he gave
[34:13] away yeah he was giving away Max is I
[34:16] love Max he's he's good friend of mine
[34:19] uh but he's he was crazy man he was he
[34:22] gave like Alex Jones I think like 10,000
[34:25] Bitcoin and and he used to give people
[34:27] like Bitcoin in the thousands back in
[34:29] the day and and that's just the way he
[34:32] is I feel like back then he was like one
[34:35] of like a 100 people on the planet that
[34:38] you know used to Advocate about Bitcoin
[34:42] right so um max is is one of my favorite
[34:46] ogs he is uh a personality of his own
[34:51] he's a he's a first principl thinker he
[34:55] doesn't give a a a about
[34:58] uh governments or companies or this or
[35:01] that he truly says what's on his mind
[35:04] and he's
[35:05] a he's I'm lucky we are all lucky to
[35:09] have Max in the Bitcoin community and um
[35:12] have him be a part of it so you're
[35:14] watching us Max I love
[35:16] you it's so great yeah he was two days
[35:19] ago on my my podcast the first time ever
[35:22] I'm glad that he also came on my show
[35:24] really cool you also said Bitcoin edms
[35:27] you have in in your restaurant why did
[35:29] you deploy those and what's the what's
[35:30] the game plan here yeah
[35:32] so after we bought Bitcoin
[35:36] um we tried to figure out what other
[35:39] ways uh can we sort of integrate Bitcoin
[35:43] with our business um so we looked at
[35:46] payments and
[35:47] payments you know the way our compan
[35:49] structured and having franchises which
[35:51] operate as separate businesses um
[35:55] payments is a little bit trickier um um
[35:58] unless we get you know all of them to
[35:59] voluntarily oped in uh so we we started
[36:03] thinking about what other ways could we
[36:05] integrate Bitcoin to the company and um
[36:09] I met a company um called Bitcoin well
[36:14] up in Canada and Bitcoin well offers
[36:18] Bitcoin machines for businesses and they
[36:23] pay them rent and that rent is either in
[36:27] cash or in Bitcoin and I talked to the
[36:29] company uh and we made a deal and we
[36:32] started putting Bitcoin ATMs in our
[36:35] restaurants I think now we
[36:38] have uh I think about 11 Bitcoin ATM
[36:41] machines uh across our 44 so not every
[36:44] store has a Bitcoin ATM machine it's up
[36:47] to that company to decide whether they
[36:49] want to put one or not but then we got
[36:52] an extra stream of Revenue that just
[36:55] comes in Bitcoin and
[36:58] to show you how powerful that is uh
[37:01] Robin so I'll just give you an example
[37:04] for one of those
[37:06] machines okay so that company pays us
[37:12] $250 in
[37:14] Bitcoin every month okay
[37:19] and one of those machines was
[37:23] installed 3 years and like 4 months ago
[37:27] so 3 years and 4 months ago so if you do
[37:31] the
[37:32] math if you would have just received
[37:34] that money in Fiat in
[37:36] dollars you would have had around
[37:40] $10,000
[37:41] okay but because we received that rent
[37:46] money in
[37:47] Bitcoin for that one machine for that
[37:50] one restaurant that account has now
[37:53] grown
[37:54] to 20
[37:58] around
[37:59] $25,000 in Bitcoin and that's just from
[38:02] holding it three and a half years and I
[38:04] expect within the next year it's
[38:05] probably going to be like 50,000 or
[38:08] something crazy like that
[38:10] so compare that to just earning
[38:14] $10,000 over a three-year period That's
[38:18] The Power of Bitcoin right
[38:22] so if you guys can find any way to
[38:25] integrate Bitcoin um in your business
[38:29] whether it's through payments or ATMs or
[38:30] any other way a way where you can just
[38:32] earn more
[38:34] Bitcoin um and keep it and that's the
[38:36] key because a lot of businesses out
[38:39] there they're like oh yeah we accept
[38:40] Bitcoin but we'll accept it and then
[38:42] sell it for dollars right away that's
[38:45] just like adding another payment card
[38:47] that's just having like Visa Mastercard
[38:49] and Bitcoin right it's not really you're
[38:52] not going to gain anything out of
[38:54] it so find a way to earn earn more
[38:58] Bitcoin and keep it on your balance
[38:59] sheet for the long term and that's
[39:02] that's the true power of Bitcoin in my
[39:05] mind that's why I also now accept from
[39:08] all my sponsors payments in Bitcoin the
[39:11] only problem amazing the only problem I
[39:14] I run into probably really soon to
[39:16] figure out how to pay my bills because I
[39:19] I don't have feat left and now my
[39:20] payments also come in Bitcoin which is
[39:22] amazing thing because like you save on
[39:26] the exchange fee
[39:27] you get the the thing directly in your
[39:30] account and there's no better feeling
[39:32] like that it feels so good to like oh
[39:34] just got paid in bit I love it so
[39:37] much really best and and Bitcoin
[39:40] payments you said this is not possible
[39:42] because of the franchise um model so
[39:44] basically all the franchisees would have
[39:46] to opt in in the in the in the payments
[39:49] model so no tahinis uh that accepts
[39:52] Bitcoin right
[39:54] now yeah I mean it is possible it's just
[39:59] very complicated to do and you know a
[40:03] lot of you know if you would accept it
[40:06] and you want to sell it the accounting
[40:09] for the taxes at that point becomes very
[40:13] difficult for these individual
[40:16] restaurants uh and it it's doable it's
[40:20] actually easier to be done if you just
[40:22] own the one restaurant or the one store
[40:25] or two you know if you own two stores
[40:28] individually and and you want to accept
[40:31] Bitcoin it's a lot easier but when
[40:32] you're
[40:33] running uh for a franchise company like
[40:36] ours it gets a little bit more
[40:38] complicated however for all of you out
[40:41] there because we've been um screamed at
[40:45] and yelled at by the Bitcoin Community H
[40:47] why don't you accept Bitcoin we are
[40:50] working on
[40:52] something stay tuned everyone and um if
[40:57] just it's complicated it needs time so
[41:00] uh all I'm going to say is just stay
[41:02] tuned really cool so maybe Bitcoin
[41:06] payments in heis soon let's
[41:09] see really cool um one thing that
[41:14] um also had a podcast around that I
[41:16] don't know if you know Matthew luzak the
[41:19] author of feat
[41:21] food um which is also interesting
[41:23] because your a restaurant owner who has
[41:25] adopted a Bitcoin standard
[41:27] um how do you think that that's first of
[41:30] all besides your restaurant is that a
[41:32] thing feared food where where you see
[41:35] like because of the money our food got
[41:37] worse over time and and the sound money
[41:40] system could actually make in general
[41:42] our food healthier or do you think
[41:44] that's just human psychology and has
[41:47] nothing to do with money I have to read
[41:48] the book I haven't read the book Fiat
[41:50] food uh I'd have to fully read it my gut
[41:55] instinct though tells me in a free
[41:58] market competition drives price down and
[42:02] whether that's on a sound money standard
[42:06] like Bitcoin or on a Fiat money standard
[42:09] that's probably going to still be the
[42:12] case and the way the ways restaurants uh
[42:16] in general try to try to get more
[42:19] business and compete with others is
[42:21] through driving price down and cost
[42:24] cutting and spring inflation and
[42:28] and uh you know lowering the quality of
[42:33] food and stuff like that um so I think
[42:38] I'm hopeful that it could change some of
[42:41] the structural things at the top like
[42:45] you know I I'm not really sure I don't I
[42:48] don't really know I don't think it will
[42:50] make that big of a change but again I
[42:53] could be wrong on this one I'd have to
[42:55] read the other side and and and see what
[42:58] the other side is saying before I could
[43:00] really give an opinion but as as a guy
[43:03] who runs a food company um we try
[43:07] so like I said there's there's you know
[43:10] the ways you compete in in food is
[43:13] mainly through price you'll see
[43:15] companies do campaigns be and behind
[43:19] those campaigns are like $5 meals and
[43:22] and $4 meals and $2 sandwiches and this
[43:26] and that that's how they compete and you
[43:30] know I know this because we you know we
[43:32] took a decision to sort
[43:34] of try to compete on the other side on
[43:37] what you get side of the equation
[43:39] because you can you can compete on on
[43:43] you know what you pay side of the
[43:45] equation or what the what what the
[43:47] customer pays and you can compete on
[43:51] what the the value the customer gets so
[43:55] we've decided to go to attack the value
[43:59] of what the customer gets through you
[44:01] know great customer
[44:03] service um little touches on the food
[44:08] little touches on uh the the brand and
[44:12] the way the brand is being portrayed and
[44:15] and um and all of these little things in
[44:18] the packaging and the you know the the
[44:20] little things we do for our guests
[44:23] whether it's thank you notes or a nice
[44:25] smile or or just make them feel good and
[44:29] this is the approach that we've
[44:32] chosen however most people in the
[44:34] industry choose the other side and
[44:37] eventually uh that drives all the bad
[44:40] food habits in our
[44:43] industry
[44:45] so it could be but I don't think so it's
[44:50] interesting I definitely can recommend
[44:52] it uh Co off is also saer moose Fiat
[44:55] food uh go it's a it's an interesting
[44:57] read um and can definitely recommend it
[45:00] but I do think so because I think in the
[45:03] Bitcoin Community we have a little bit
[45:05] the tendency of like oh Bitcoin fixes
[45:07] everything and I think that's a little
[45:09] bit too extreme uh Bitcoin fixes money
[45:13] most foremost and money is so
[45:16] fundamental to our lives that yes this
[45:17] touches a lot but humans are still
[45:20] humans and the psychology and this
[45:23] things play into it a lot um now we come
[45:26] to end routine of the podcast where we
[45:28] have two questions the first question is
[45:30] always the same question for every guest
[45:32] uh what can we learn from you besides
[45:35] Bitcoin um I'd say I'm pretty good at so
[45:40] so I'm I'm the chief marketing officer
[45:42] for the company um I would say I'm
[45:45] pretty good at marketing so I mean if
[45:48] you wantan to just as a short answer
[45:52] um if if you want to see the results of
[45:55] some of the stuff that
[45:57] myself and my team have done uh just go
[46:00] to our YouTube channel and uh we were
[46:04] able to through creativity and and
[46:07] Creative Marketing tactics uh we were
[46:10] able to
[46:11] amass uh around three million
[46:14] subscribers for a small food company um
[46:18] that is more than McDonald's chipotle
[46:24] Chick-fil-A and Burger King combined
[46:29] so um that's pretty cool I think um I
[46:35] can I think you know if you wantan to I
[46:38] don't want to like keep talking about
[46:39] what we do but it's it's very
[46:41] complicated but I make it look kind of
[46:43] simple with the results so go check out
[46:45] our YouTube channel and and while you're
[46:48] at it give us a subscribe and check out
[46:50] our stuff and see how we were able to do
[46:54] that and um check our our shorts section
[46:58] that's where me most of our work has has
[47:00] gone and also Tik Tok and all the other
[47:05] avenues um so yeah
[47:08] that's that' be a good one that's really
[47:10] impressive I also saw a YouTube channel
[47:12] I was like wow that's a that's a a big
[47:15] YouTube channel for uh it's it's like a
[47:18] something you would expect from like
[47:20] McDonald's or Burg came from like a
[47:21] established really big business but like
[47:23] you're doing an an amazing job in in
[47:25] promoting uh uh tahinis really really
[47:28] good love that a lot um now our second
[47:32] question of of the end routine the
[47:35] question comes from the previous guest
[47:38] uh
[47:38] and the previous guest gives a question
[47:41] to the next guest without knowing who
[47:42] the next guest actually is uh and the
[47:44] question is what's the difference
[47:45] between Bitcoin and a living organism
[47:48] difference wow that's uh that's a deep
[47:51] one you
[47:53] know I I I think Bitcoin
[47:57] is is like a if you were to compare it
[48:00] to a living organism it would be similar
[48:03] to comparing it like to plankton in the
[48:07] ocean or
[48:09] ants or or you know uh
[48:15] insects something like that
[48:18] where you know it's it's built in a way
[48:21] the structure is built in a way where
[48:23] you could throw a nuclear bomb and in
[48:27] the ocean in in the most dense
[48:30] Plankton uh part of the ocean and you
[48:33] wouldn't affect like
[48:35] 05% of all the plankton in the world or
[48:40] if you drop a nuclear bomb
[48:42] on and on an area that's filled with
[48:47] ants for example you still wouldn't kill
[48:50] all you know 0.1% of the ants of the
[48:53] world right um I think it's comparable
[48:57] to something like that and basically
[49:01] indestructible through decentralization
[49:04] and infrastructure and you know no
[49:07] there's no one central point of failure
[49:11] uh when it comes to ants
[49:14] right uh so I think that that's a good
[49:17] way of sort of comparing them to each
[49:19] other really really cool I L that a lot
[49:22] um thank you so much Ali for being on uh
