[00:00] the more I study Bitcoin I see more the
[00:02] value of Bitcoin so much so that I owned
[00:05] a property it was a condo in Miami and I
[00:09] sold that property 2044 we could be
[00:12] looking at a full Bitcoin standard
[00:14] doesn't matter who's in power because
[00:16] our system a debt-based system and
[00:18] fat-based system is set up to favor the
[00:22] people in government and people at the
[00:24] top I have a big place in my heart for
[00:26] the people in Zimbabwe many people there
[00:29] probably don't have bank accounts some
[00:31] do but the bank accounts charge such
[00:33] high fees once you get to bitcoin where
[00:36] Bitcoin is your personal hurdle rate
[00:38] it's hard to invest in anything else
[00:40] your most valuable resource is
[00:42] [Music]
[00:45] time I saw some pictures that you were
[00:47] also at Bitcoin at the Bitcoin
[00:49] conference this year I think even at
[00:50] Prague and at the Nashville one is that
[00:53] is that right I was only in Nashville
[00:56] that was my first conference that I've
[00:58] attended
[01:00] was it the first Bitcoin conference now
[01:01] now you know how how the conferences are
[01:04] and it's the biggest one in the world so
[01:06] it's a nice one to start with there were
[01:08] a lot of people how was your impression
[01:11] of the the nationville conference is was
[01:13] it interesting for you or did you had
[01:15] any big takeways from that just that
[01:17] there it was nice to see so many people
[01:21] like-minded people you know a lot of
[01:23] different
[01:25] backgrounds even though politically they
[01:28] seem to support
[01:31] you know mostly Trump but
[01:35] backgrounds all different and yet we all
[01:38] agree on this one
[01:40] common Bitcoin perspective and um
[01:44] obviously everyone is on a different
[01:46] part of their Journey but I really like
[01:49] to see that common ground and you know
[01:52] being around bitcoiners yeah it's the
[01:55] drum thing is interesting because uh I I
[01:58] feel like Bitcoin is a very of about
[02:00] Trump at least the the bitcoiners that I
[02:03] know because they're like yeah he is now
[02:06] a bitcoiner but he's not that long a
[02:08] bitcoiner and does he really understand
[02:10] Bitcoin what what's your take is do you
[02:12] think he actually understood it I think
[02:14] he understands it better than he used to
[02:16] and I think he's being advised very well
[02:20] and what I find interesting is why would
[02:23] a US president adopt Bitcoin when it
[02:28] goes against what the system is
[02:30] that's interesting why do you think this
[02:32] is well you know Jeff Booth always says
[02:36] it doesn't matter who's in power because
[02:38] our system a debt-based system and
[02:41] fat-based system is set up to favor the
[02:47] people in government and people at the
[02:49] top
[02:51] so while while they might want to put
[02:55] Bitcoin
[02:57] into you know and and it would AB
[02:59] absolutely help our debt it they are
[03:04] benefiting from this current system so I
[03:07] just find it interesting and I just I
[03:09] just am a little skeptical of how much
[03:11] they would put us on a Bitcoin standard
[03:14] I'm also thinking maybe they realize
[03:18] that Bitcoin might be something uh and
[03:22] uh if in the case Bitcoin actually
[03:25] catches on and it might be actually
[03:26] something let's just put some of them on
[03:29] our balance sheet it's just like an
[03:32] insurance policy for for the US Dollars
[03:34] even because they have gold in their
[03:37] reserves um but what if they just put
[03:39] also some Bitcoin in their Reserve uh
[03:41] they they still can print as much as you
[03:43] as they want but if if Bitcoin actually
[03:47] gets to a world Reserve currency status
[03:51] they only benefit from that I feel like
[03:53] and and maybe at some point the the game
[03:55] theory of coming into Bitcoin actually
[03:58] develops that much that
[04:00] actually adopt the Bitcoin standard in a
[04:03] way but still issu the US dollars for
[04:05] paying taxes and stuff like that well
[04:07] I'd love to see that so and and
[04:10] obviously Trump has been more Pro
[04:14] Bitcoin than than the Democrats
[04:17] obviously um Kennedy was even more
[04:21] knowledgeable on bitcoin very
[04:23] knowledgeable but he doesn't have the
[04:25] same backing that that Trump does so
[04:30] that was just interesting to observe and
[04:33] see I would love to see Kennedy versus
[04:37] Trump at the final stages because and
[04:41] because I think Kennedy I'm not well
[04:43] versed with American politics because
[04:45] I'm me in Europe uh but as I see it
[04:49] Kennedy was from the Democrat side and
[04:51] he then dropped out of the party to be
[04:54] independent Runner but if he would be
[04:57] the Democrat front runner I would I
[04:59] would love to see those debates because
[05:01] I think that could be actually
[05:03] interesting to have two presidential
[05:06] candidates who try to fight who's more
[05:10] Bitcoin focused and I think Kennedy
[05:12] would win that battle uh being more
[05:15] Bitcoin focused that would be amazing I
[05:17] heard you say that um you don't know any
[05:20] candidates in Europe who really focus on
[05:23] bitcoin no unfortunately not uh it's
[05:26] it's it's interesting because in Austria
[05:29] like Europe is not a same organized as
[05:33] Europe uh Europe is not as same
[05:36] organized as as America um but I did not
[05:39] see any candidate from the European uh
[05:43] leadership even though they're not voted
[05:46] directly anyways like the you the
[05:49] European president the commissioner they
[05:52] are voted indirectly not directly by the
[05:55] people so we don't hear a lot from them
[05:57] anyways because we cannot even vote on
[05:59] them uh and from the Austrian parties
[06:02] there's not even a single word of
[06:03] Bitcoin crypto or anything uh in their
[06:06] uh strategies in uh in in program so I'm
[06:09] like completely disappointed and I hope
[06:11] this this this changes in the next few
[06:14] years now that America showed that you
[06:16] actually have to talk about that uh and
[06:18] Europe Europe will Europe will will
[06:20] change that but uh you first heard and I
[06:24] heard that story from you you first
[06:27] heard about Bitcoin with a multi-level
[06:29] marketing team is that is that right
[06:32] yes yes how did this happen so I I was
[06:36] living in Zimbabwe at the time with my
[06:40] family my family live in Zimbabwe and
[06:43] Zimbabwe as many people know has one of
[06:47] the highest inflations in the world but
[06:50] Zimbabwe is a little unusual like many
[06:53] other countries it uses the Zim dollar
[06:56] and then it uses the US dollar so people
[06:59] people who get paid in the Zim dollar
[07:02] they are the ones who subject to that
[07:04] very high inflation of over 100% a year
[07:07] often and then the people who get paid
[07:11] in us well they think the US is a great
[07:13] currency you know compared to what every
[07:16] those other people are getting paid um
[07:19] so that's another issue but while I was
[07:22] there I I still saw that there was a
[07:26] problem with inflation even in the US
[07:28] and when when I went to this multi-level
[07:31] marketing group it was they they were
[07:33] investing in Bitcoin miners which was
[07:36] even harder for me to understand at the
[07:38] time so but I understood the miners were
[07:41] you
[07:42] know doing the transactions for Bitcoin
[07:46] but and they said this is much better
[07:48] and then at the end of the the talk they
[07:50] said and we've got this other new
[07:53] product ethereum and it's even better
[07:54] than Bitcoin so I said okay well I'll
[07:58] invest in both yeah let's Do It um and
[08:01] that's how I first got introduced to it
[08:04] and yeah like I said I kind of heard
[08:07] about it right at the top of that cycle
[08:11] and when it completely crashed I got
[08:14] very nervous and try to get out it was
[08:18] it was a different setup so I wasn't in
[08:20] self- custody or anything but I it just
[08:23] taught me that not understanding the
[08:26] Bitcoin cycles and the volatility was
[08:30] I needed to learn that
[08:32] otherwise I wasn't going to invest in
[08:34] this
[08:36] asset yeah it's it's something that you
[08:40] kind of have to learn to understand like
[08:43] oh the it's volatile we're still
[08:45] early and those drops can actually
[08:47] happen it's not just a story from the
[08:49] past um but I'm more Curious like what
[08:52] did you learn uh especially from
[08:54] Zimbabwe um about Bitcoin because
[08:57] Zimbabwe is like a I think a country
[09:00] where you see the problems of the field
[09:02] currency way better than in Europe and
[09:04] America yeah so I've
[09:09] always my family still live in Zimbabwe
[09:11] and I I have a big place in my heart for
[09:14] the people in Zimbabwe you know I
[09:17] realized that my my parents were born in
[09:20] Africa my grandparents were born in
[09:22] Africa but we're not really true
[09:26] Africans we're we're we came from
[09:29] Denmark and Germany and UK originally
[09:34] and we settled there and so the people
[09:39] it's been an interesting experience
[09:41] growing up there and and living with
[09:44] that currency because in 2008 you know
[09:47] that was the biggest crash Zimbabwe ever
[09:50] had and I I remember seeing my dad with
[09:52] suitcases of money um every day just
[09:56] trying to spend it as as quick as
[09:58] possible
[09:59] because it just valued uh every day and
[10:04] and so I saw that then I came back in
[10:08] 2017 we now um still people are still
[10:12] using the same Zimbabwe currency and the
[10:15] US dollar and still dealing with the
[10:18] same problems um for people that get
[10:21] paid in the Zimbabwe currency I don't
[10:23] know how they survive um because every
[10:27] month everything goes up double
[10:30] and even if you do have US dollars in
[10:33] Zimbabwe because of the way the
[10:35] government structured they can just put
[10:37] up the taxes to bring in goods and that
[10:40] makes the prices go up so prices are
[10:43] usually going up for all people who live
[10:46] there and uh they do find a way but it's
[10:51] it's not an easy way to live so when I
[10:54] saw that um I I knew there was a problem
[10:59] with inflation but I thought the US
[11:01] dollar was a pretty good alternative at
[11:04] first how do they get the the salary is
[11:07] always a question in my mind because
[11:08] like salary usually it's like once a
[11:11] year you negotiate uh or like right now
[11:14] I'm self-employed so my salary is like
[11:17] just what I bring in but before I was
[11:19] six years in a company and I know that
[11:22] salary was always a discussion but not
[11:26] like every month it it was maybe a
[11:29] discussion like all eight months or all
[11:32] 18 months or depending on how long you
[11:34] all have been here and and if you're
[11:36] making moves in the company how is that
[11:39] when the the currency just goes up like
[11:43] currency goes up the inflation of the
[11:44] currency goes up so quick that you
[11:46] basically need to double your salary
[11:49] every month just to keep up and have the
[11:51] same purchasing power so it's the
[11:53] difference between
[11:55] government employees and private
[11:58] employees so so the government play pays
[12:01] all of the teachers and the police and
[12:04] the army with the Zimbabwe dollar and
[12:08] the the equivalent is
[12:11] probably between 100 and 300 us a month
[12:16] people have to live on $1 and $300 a
[12:20] month then private companies they can
[12:23] pay their employees anything um and they
[12:26] pay in in US sometimes so it just
[12:30] depends who you work for um and and the
[12:34] government does not increase obviously
[12:36] their salaries with inflation they cause
[12:39] the inflation by printing money and they
[12:42] give their their employees the same
[12:45] amount of money and the the employee has
[12:47] to find a way to survive with the same
[12:49] amount of money so you really see it
[12:52] firsthand um uh my brother owns his own
[12:55] company there he builds he builds houses
[12:58] and so he mostly makes US dollars he's
[13:01] not as affected as the people who get
[13:04] paid in Zim dollars so it's it's a big
[13:09] difference yeah do do they get uh
[13:12] properties like like Bitcoin more than
[13:15] in the US or is it's still they don't
[13:18] they don't get Bitcoin the the r is like
[13:20] oh I want the US dollars not
[13:22] Bitcoin exactly most people want the US
[13:26] dollars not Bitcoin there is a small
[13:29] movement now in Zimbabwe and people I
[13:32] went to a Bitcoin Meetup uh where I'm
[13:35] from and they are starting and they are
[13:40] they um it's it's from an outside
[13:43] company I think it might be a German
[13:45] company that is teaching people about
[13:47] Bitcoin and there are people that are
[13:50] starting to use it and I am I'm going to
[13:54] be talking with some of those people in
[13:56] the coming weeks but um yeah I the the
[14:01] one thing that I learned while I was
[14:03] there is there's real there's not a real
[14:05] on-ramp to bitcoin there's no coinbase
[14:07] there's no you know um any of these
[14:10] companies that we use in the western
[14:12] world if people want to buy Bitcoin they
[14:14] buy peer-to-peer
[14:16] and um so that's not easy uh to to do
[14:21] yet but I I heard that there is a
[14:24] company going to be starting
[14:26] there um and yeah because it is there in
[14:30] South Africa I know there are companies
[14:32] that you can easily buy Bitcoin and we
[14:34] live right next to South Africa so
[14:38] whatever South Africa gets eventually
[14:40] comes to Zimbabwe and other African
[14:43] countries so yeah they're it's it's
[14:46] moving forward but most people most
[14:50] people are just the US dollar would be
[14:53] better than than the Zimbabwe dollar
[14:55] there at that point do do they have uh
[14:59] online peerto peer or actually
[15:01] physically meeting peerto peer from what
[15:04] I heard it's meeting peerto peer um they
[15:07] might be via
[15:09] WhatsApp
[15:10] online yeah via WhatsApp but I heard it
[15:14] was meeting so oh man yeah I mean uh
[15:19] even in in Germany and in developed
[15:22] countries or like in Austria like we
[15:23] have two actually like Austria such a
[15:26] small country has two Bitcoin owners
[15:29] exchanges happening here and we have in
[15:31] in Swiss a great great one we have in
[15:33] Germany ones so like it's it's
[15:35] interesting we have so many but people
[15:37] still the hardcore bitcoiners want
[15:40] peer-to-peer Bitcoin because they don't
[15:42] want KC and stuff like that but in
[15:46] Zimbabwe probably they don't care about
[15:49] KC and stuff like that not that much
[15:51] they just want to preserve the financial
[15:53] energy exactly exactly and many people
[15:56] there probably don't have Bank accounts
[16:00] some do but the bank accounts charge
[16:02] such high fees that people yeah probably
[16:06] just want they just want to get some
[16:08] Bitcoin once they learn about you know
[16:11] the properties of it is it more free to
[16:13] a certain extent because the financial
[16:16] police there is probably also uh not as
[16:19] powerful as there in in Europe in the
[16:22] European Union uh where they control and
[16:24] monitor everything and then they're
[16:26] seeing all the computer programs where
[16:28] like oh there has some fishy thing let's
[16:30] let's call there um so it's probably a
[16:33] little bit more Wild West than the
[16:34] Zimbabwe yes you know I think it's such
[16:38] a small amount that they're not
[16:40] concerned with it you know the gold
[16:43] market in Zimbabwe is heavily monitored
[16:46] and everything goes through the
[16:48] government uh but Bitcoin is still so
[16:50] small I I don't think they worry about
[16:52] it too much okay okay interesting um
[16:56] what so you're back in in America
[16:58] America uh and what do you say to do
[17:02] your American friends or colleagues or
[17:04] people who you just meet in America who
[17:07] say if you have those uh people in your
[17:10] life who say that inflation is
[17:13] good how how do and I I hear that from
[17:16] even friends of mine what do you say to
[17:19] them to make them Open the Eyes to say
[17:22] like oh no inflation is not good and why
[17:25] not even a little bit inflation they
[17:27] always go ahead then to me like oh yeah
[17:29] they have like hundreds and hundreds of
[17:31] percent of inflation that's bad but a
[17:33] little inflation that's good we need
[17:35] that two three% of inflation like what
[17:37] do you tell them so so that's funny I
[17:40] haven't heard inflation is good but what
[17:43] I think I hear is that inflation is
[17:46] normal you know I think we have been so
[17:49] ingrained to believing that that 2 3% is
[17:53] normal that nobody thinks beyond that
[17:56] and and for most people in the US and
[17:59] I'm in Miami especially I see a lot of
[18:02] people doing very well yes we are we are
[18:07] struggling with inflation I mean during
[18:09] Co I saw that you know I buy organic
[18:13] food in in America because the regular
[18:15] food here is not very good and or
[18:20] healthy so I buy organic and organic
[18:22] food went up at least 30% um and so when
[18:27] that happened I thought wow you know
[18:29] it's not just two or 3% it's not 10%
[18:31] it's 30% in some areas and people so
[18:35] people see that inflation is happening
[18:37] and that's too high for people but I
[18:40] don't I think they think a little bit of
[18:42] inflation is normal and plus people that
[18:45] I know you know do pretty well and when
[18:48] you do pretty well you can handle a
[18:50] little bit you can handle not that you
[18:53] like it but you can handle it so I
[18:57] haven't found way you know to get to the
[19:01] why Bitcoin yet with many of my friends
[19:04] because they
[19:05] still they don't see a need for it and
[19:09] when I talk about Bitcoin they oh yeah
[19:12] you're you're into Bitcoin and that's
[19:14] about it nobody wants to know more is
[19:16] the pain not high enough is is is they
[19:19] they live in in in too good of a world
[19:22] still some some people do you I I have
[19:26] some I I do real estate here and I have
[19:29] some friends that um and colleagues that
[19:32] do real estate and do very well and the
[19:35] pain is not high the life is is very
[19:37] good for some
[19:38] people and and yeah I think that's
[19:42] exactly right you know the reason that I
[19:45] got into Bitcoin is because I stopped
[19:49] enjoying part of what I was doing and so
[19:53] when I stopped enjoying part of I was
[19:55] doing and then I also had a good friend
[19:59] just suddenly die in a car accident I
[20:02] suddenly said to myself life is too
[20:05] short life is too short to be doing
[20:08] things that I don't enjoy and it kind of
[20:11] hit me in a way you know in Bitcoin um
[20:15] we often talk about that um your most
[20:19] valuable resource is time and I've heard
[20:22] that but I really felt it when that
[20:25] happened I don't want to spend my time
[20:27] working in something I don't
[20:29] enjoy um when when life can can be short
[20:35] so I got I started looking into
[20:38] Bitcoin when I when I realized that and
[20:42] I think for many people many people
[20:45] don't um get to that point you know I
[20:49] think there has to be pain like you said
[20:51] there has to be enough pain either
[20:54] in in in your finances or in your life
[20:58] to to bring you to study
[21:01] Bitcoin why is Bitcoin for for the time
[21:04] aspect so important I I feel like um
[21:09] when when you talk about Bitcoin it
[21:10] gives you back time uh but a lot of
[21:13] people still struggle with that concept
[21:15] um why was in the time where you felt
[21:19] like oh I don't enjoy what I'm doing um
[21:22] I want to to change something I value my
[21:24] time but why was Bitcoin so present in
[21:27] that that moment H that's a good
[21:30] question because I realized that if I
[21:33] saved
[21:35] in a vehicle that would preserve my
[21:40] savings then I could have more time to
[21:44] do what I want and and what I really
[21:47] want to do I I don't want to buy fancy
[21:51] cars and all of that I I want to travel
[21:55] and see my family I want to yeah travel
[21:59] occasionally and see the world I want to
[22:01] buy organic food and I and I want to
[22:04] live the life I want to live so it was
[22:08] more about that I want to spend my time
[22:12] wisely and rather than doing things that
[22:16] I really don't want to do I'm not sure
[22:19] if that answered the question it it
[22:22] definitely answers that and it's it's
[22:24] really cool to to see that um you also
[22:27] said that you were in real estate are
[22:30] you still doing something in real estate
[22:32] and what are you doing there yeah so I
[22:34] still do real estate I'm I'm a real
[22:37] estate agent in Miami and I I work with
[22:41] clients I work mostly with elderly
[22:44] clients which I do enjoy I work with
[22:46] like working with the elderly clients
[22:49] but I you know
[22:52] I I what I don't enjoy is working real
[22:56] estate is one of those professions that
[22:59] you can
[23:00] do hundreds of hours and not get paid
[23:03] you can show a a time a house 50 times
[23:07] and then the buyer can decide no I'm not
[23:10] buying and you don't make one cent and I
[23:13] found that people expect you to do that
[23:18] and that's the part I don't enjoy I it's
[23:21] kind of expected for a realtor and and I
[23:24] know that many people say realtors make
[23:27] too high a Comm Mission well that's
[23:29] actually changing in Florida now um but
[23:33] but good Realtors work hard and they're
[23:36] worth it but people just have this idea
[23:40] that Realtors need to work whether
[23:43] they're paid or not because they make
[23:44] such high commission and I don't enjoy
[23:46] that feeling I don't enjoy that feeling
[23:49] so I enjoy working with people who
[23:51] respect my time and I respect
[23:55] theirs but um there's there's two sides
[23:58] to you know the real estate market here
[24:02] and then of course I from studying
[24:04] Bitcoin you know I often hear people say
[24:08] I you know my house is going down when I
[24:12] when I price it in Bitcoin and my goal
[24:16] when I first got into real estate was to
[24:19] buy properties as a store of value so
[24:23] that I could store wealth and make
[24:25] passive income and then I started
[24:27] studying Bitcoin point and I thought
[24:29] maybe this is a better way maybe you
[24:32] know not dealing with the renters not
[24:35] dealing with the taxes not dealing with
[24:38] all the things that come with owning
[24:40] property um I I didn't love that part I
[24:43] really don't love that part it's it's it
[24:46] is um it is it is obviously a privilege
[24:50] to have extra houses and to manage them
[24:53] and to make passive income from that but
[24:56] the idea of storing money in Bitcoin uh
[25:00] as I get older makes more sense to me
[25:03] than than buying properties the only
[25:06] thing that I that I would say is the
[25:08] passive income would be
[25:10] nice um from Real Estate at the
[25:14] moment it's it's a it's more of
[25:17] a bitcoin's more of a storage value for
[25:20] me if you watch or listen to my podcast
[25:23] on a regular basis I'll guess you
[25:25] already bought some Bitcoin and now most
[25:28] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[25:32] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[25:34] personal recommendation for Hardware
[25:36] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[25:39] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[25:41] gift for a friend who has still the
[25:43] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[25:46] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[25:49] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss SL Robin
[25:54] to get your bitbox and if you really
[25:56] want to bulletproof yourself custody
[25:59] setup your security setup and maybe even
[26:01] your citizenship set up you have to talk
[26:04] to the Bitcoin way if you go to the
[26:07] Bitcoin way.com
[26:09] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[26:13] free call where you can dive deep with
[26:16] them if your self custody setup is
[26:19] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[26:22] maybe might be improvable or your
[26:24] digital footprint in general is secure
[26:27] they are experts in cyber security in
[26:30] Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[26:33] secure sovereign individual in general
[26:37] yeah the the passive income is
[26:39] interesting I mean there are the there
[26:41] is the possibilities to do it with
[26:43] Bitcoin
[26:44] miners uh there are solutions out there
[26:47] uh whether you do it yourself or you
[26:49] rent
[26:50] something uh but uh it's it's always
[26:53] like or you can even buy um a machine
[26:57] let it host there and and split the
[26:59] income with with
[27:01] other other miners that host for you so
[27:04] like the passive income could be
[27:06] something with Bitcoin even um but the
[27:10] like the general thing is what what
[27:12] Bitcoin is trying to do is just like be
[27:14] being perfect money uh and money has no
[27:17] yield even though we really would like
[27:19] it to have it uh that that's why there's
[27:22] this Celsius things and F FDX not
[27:25] because of that but FDX also blew up Sal
[27:28] zos was so successful and then they blew
[27:30] up uh because there is no yield on
[27:33] bitcoin and people try to put a yield on
[27:36] on it I mean there's always the way to
[27:39] to get a loan against your Bitcoin uh uh
[27:42] if you can pay off the the the the
[27:45] payments and installments and that could
[27:48] be an interesting option uh to discover
[27:51] uh I myself don't do that I don't
[27:54] recommend it uh but it's always
[27:56] something worth exploring um and but why
[28:01] did you then choose Bitcoin over real
[28:02] estate I think that that we had that a
[28:05] couple times of on the podcast already
[28:07] that real estate versus Bitcoin and even
[28:10] myself like I was going into real estate
[28:13] right before I discovered Bitcoin and
[28:14] then I did not go into real estate I
[28:17] talked about that story on the podcast
[28:18] already um but why did you not go into
[28:21] real estate and and stick with Bitcoin
[28:23] so I'm still working in real estate but
[28:27] I I see I see more and more the more I
[28:31] study Bitcoin I see more the value of
[28:34] Bitcoin so much so that um I did I owned
[28:39] a property it was a condo in Miami and I
[28:44] sold that
[28:45] property because well for two reasons I
[28:50] I always believe that we all need a
[28:52] place to live right and and I think
[28:55] having a home I know some people choose
[28:57] to rent and that's fine I don't the one
[28:59] thing I don't like about renting is your
[29:01] landlord can say at any time you know
[29:04] I'm selling and then you have to move
[29:06] and that that's one reason I like to own
[29:10] U but the this property that I had we
[29:14] have a problem in Florida with very high
[29:17] condo association fees and in 2025
[29:21] they're going to get even higher for
[29:23] many condos and that's because of the
[29:27] Surfside building in Miami that
[29:29] collapsed so the state made it the laws
[29:32] very um
[29:35] very tight for Florida condos in 2025 so
[29:39] that's coming and so I wanted to sell my
[29:43] condo because I don't want to pay double
[29:45] the amount of fees but I also saw the
[29:48] opportunity to put the money into
[29:50] Bitcoin as a better store of value going
[29:54] forward and you know at the time that
[29:57] was a little while ago I I I do still
[30:02] want that money to put back into
[30:04] property so I did put it into the ETFs
[30:06] which I know for many bitcoiners is a no
[30:09] no
[30:10] but I the reason I did that was because
[30:13] I wanted to put sell it at some point
[30:16] and put it back into property now I'm
[30:19] kind of rethinking things and I as I
[30:21] learn more about Bitcoin I know that
[30:24] having Bitcoin in self custody is a
[30:28] obviously the most important thing
[30:30] because that is what true self-
[30:32] sovereignty is um I also put some in
[30:35] Tesla which I heard you used to invest
[30:37] in um just yeah to keep up with with
[30:42] inflation right I mean you put in those
[30:44] kind of things because I'm trying to
[30:47] keep up with inflation and then at a
[30:50] later date buy another property but um
[30:54] yeah so that was an interesting and a
[30:56] nerve-wracking EXP experience but the
[30:58] reason I did it there was two big
[31:00] reasons one because uh the condo fees
[31:03] are going up too high and then two
[31:05] because I see that Val the value of
[31:08] Bitcoin is going to outpace the value of
[31:11] real estate long
[31:13] term yeah and I think that's that's a
[31:16] major thing like when once you get to
[31:18] bitcoin where Bitcoin is your personal
[31:20] hurdle rate it's hard to invest in
[31:24] anything else like once you get like oh
[31:26] Bitcoin is my hurdle rate and you
[31:27] measure everything in Bitcoin also your
[31:29] other Investments measured in Bitcoin uh
[31:32] also like even even the Tesla charts
[31:34] probably looks a lot less different a
[31:37] lot a lot different once you measure
[31:40] Tesla in Bitcoin uh especially long term
[31:44] but yeah it was a was a big big bit
[31:47] Tesla believe I think still that they
[31:49] have a big future um but I just enjoy
[31:53] that I don't have to worry about what a
[31:56] management team has to do like
[31:58] Tesla is an amazing company but they
[32:02] still could do some weird thing uh that
[32:05] I don't like I till now they are
[32:08] executing really good and I love the
[32:09] cars I love the products um but the
[32:12] Peace of Mind of of Bitcoin not having
[32:14] to worry about anything just like saving
[32:17] it uh securely in your self custody uh
[32:20] wall that you have uh for yourself um
[32:24] that's that's peace of mind that's a lot
[32:27] Worth to me right now and also like with
[32:29] real estate it's it's a lot worth that I
[32:31] don't have to uh be like oh there's some
[32:35] some rent of of my property calling me
[32:38] that the the toilet is not working or
[32:41] that and that and and I don't have to
[32:43] worry about either doing it myself or
[32:46] hiring someone that does it for me
[32:48] that's more like a business and as a
[32:50] business side I just want to focus with
[32:53] uh with Bitcoin content creation and on
[32:55] a financial savings side I just want to
[32:57] save Bitcoin coin that that's what I
[32:59] want to do uh and at least the next 10
[33:01] years as I put it out yesterday's a
[33:03] tweet that's like my my dedication now
[33:06] for the next 10 years uh and it's it's a
[33:10] it's a great thing thing to do but you
[33:12] living in Mami that's that's really cool
[33:15] um are you considering moving to another
[33:18] country if if America does something
[33:20] weird with Bitcoin I mean it does not
[33:22] look like that right now but is there if
[33:25] anything you're like maybe let's go to
[33:28] maybe let's go to other jurisdictions I
[33:30] have thought about it I've thought about
[33:32] it my family as I said they live in
[33:34] Zimbabwe so that's where I go back most
[33:37] of the time but I have I have looked at
[33:43] places like Portugal Spain El Salvador
[33:47] um but it you know it's at this point in
[33:50] life most of my friends are either in
[33:53] Miami and my family in Zimbabwe so it
[33:56] doesn't make sense for me right now to
[33:58] move but I would consider I would
[34:01] consider it that's is really cool where
[34:03] do you see um when we talk about Bitcoin
[34:05] in the future where do you see it in
[34:06] like the next 20 years uh where do you
[34:08] see the the developments uh going I
[34:11] always love to to see where it's going
[34:14] longer term and I think 20 years for
[34:16] some reason is one of my favorite time
[34:18] frames I feel like 10 years is too
[34:20] shortsighted uh and and 30 40 50 years
[34:23] is just way too far in the future for me
[34:26] uh to look at and 20 years is kind of
[34:28] nice Middle Ground where do you see it
[34:30] in in years well Robin I think you are
[34:34] an incredible young Visionary because I
[34:38] can barely see 10 years out so I I think
[34:42] I would like to hear from you where you
[34:44] see it in 20 years uh because for me I
[34:48] I'm just hopeful that we're closer to a
[34:51] Bitcoin standard but I'd love to know
[34:53] what you think oh yeah I'm I'm working
[34:56] actually on a
[34:58] I'm working on a theory uh and this
[35:00] Theory started as just a Google Docs uh
[35:03] then it developed into a an an article
[35:07] uh it's still in a Google Docs saved but
[35:09] at first it was a note thing uh and now
[35:12] it's like nine 10 pages or something
[35:14] like that uh with just ideas but not
[35:18] fought out ideas it's just like two
[35:21] sentence or three sentence ideas and
[35:24] those ideas I have to kind of summarize
[35:26] and then think them
[35:28] to the end and there might be some it's
[35:31] definitely too long for an article at
[35:34] this point so I might make an a book out
[35:37] of it I don't know if I sell a book
[35:40] maybe I just give out in PDF because uh
[35:43] it's it's then I also have to Market it
[35:45] and think about all that stuff I might
[35:48] do it but I don't know if maybe I just
[35:50] release a PDF but some like the hard
[35:53] copies so I might do it with Amazon or
[35:54] something like that um because I have a
[35:57] lot lot of ideas where the future of
[36:00] Bitcoin is going and how this future
[36:02] will look like and this is to to my
[36:06] guests like I think about the future a
[36:10] lot myself but the most of the IDE are
[36:14] inspired by my podcast episodes so that
[36:18] book when it is a book I don't know what
[36:21] what I will do with with that now but I
[36:23] think I will make a book that book will
[36:26] probably be a more of a condensed summar
[36:31] summary of uh exactly uh all those
[36:35] things that the guests already sparked
[36:37] the the things that I heard from them
[36:40] the things that I heard from them in the
[36:42] future so it it will be interesting and
[36:45] I think that
[36:47] 2044 we could be looking at a full
[36:49] Bitcoin standard uh where fat currencies
[36:53] are still there but you can almost
[36:57] everywhere
[36:58] hey with Bitcoin you have at some rest
[37:02] some countries already Bitcoin as a unit
[37:05] of account not all the countries I think
[37:08] because different countries have
[37:09] different Paces uh I mean we already
[37:11] started seeing that Salvador when you go
[37:14] to some restaurants there there are
[37:16] Satoshi prices written and US dollar
[37:18] prices so to certain extent it's already
[37:21] here but 2044 is I feel like the time
[37:25] where we really see a Bitcoin adoption
[37:28] where really see a um a major Bitcoin
[37:32] adoption where you can just have your
[37:34] Bitcoin wallet and be fine you don't
[37:36] have to have a bank account I mean there
[37:38] is a as uh Beach Bitcoin is like was on
[37:42] the podcast and I think this was the
[37:44] first company that was on a podcast that
[37:45] said oh yeah we we don't have a Bitcoin
[37:48] we don't have an feat account we just
[37:50] have Bitcoin and they live in
[37:52] Switzerland middle of Europe it's not as
[37:54] salv uh and and they only have Bitcoin
[37:57] account and they do everything with that
[38:00] so uh it's it it's closer than we think
[38:05] but it's just not yet mainstream and in
[38:08] 20 years it might as well be mainstream
[38:12] you have those pictures from where in in
[38:15] 1921 or something like that was there
[38:18] was one uh car and a bunch of horses and
[38:21] then like 10 20 years later it was the
[38:23] other way around so uh also with cell
[38:26] phone adoption
[38:27] against the landline and that was pretty
[38:30] quick uh look back 20 years nobody had a
[38:33] cell phone at the hand and and now uh
[38:36] you have to lock your phone into some
[38:39] save to to not be addicted to it so it's
[38:44] we will get addicted to bitcoin that
[38:46] that's kind of my my future I'm already
[38:49] addicted to bitcoin I I I want to buy
[38:51] more even though I don't have any feeld
[38:53] left that's that's a I I have to fight
[38:55] that addiction uh so that's that's kind
[38:57] of where I see see it going in in the
[39:01] long run and it could be five years it
[39:04] could be 50 years uh but I think it will
[39:09] be 20 years I'm looking at like 20 44 I
[39:12] also laughed out loud when I saw the
[39:14] Michael sailor presentation because I'm
[39:17] ahead actually have a document named
[39:21] 2044 even like long before Michael SAA
[39:24] came on the stage then he came on the
[39:25] stage and said 2045
[39:28] so now now if I actually give a book out
[39:31] and say call it 2044 everyone will say
[39:35] I'm a copy cast from Micha saor but I
[39:37] can live with
[39:40] that uh do you have any just one thing
[39:43] on that I I know what you mean when you
[39:45] say you're addicted to bitcoin when when
[39:48] I when I saw it go down you know in
[39:51] price I always look do I have more fear
[39:54] that I can buy buy more um and I know
[39:58] that focusing on prices is not the best
[40:01] way but but it but you know we buy it in
[40:06] Fiat so it matters I can buy more when
[40:09] it's
[40:10] lower I think right now the price
[40:12] actually matters uh I think the the
[40:15] whole thing of like or the Fiat price
[40:17] doesn't matter it's like of course it
[40:21] matters because right now in my
[40:23] Supermarket uh the unit of account is
[40:25] euros and for you it is US Dollars um if
[40:29] I buy anything uh it's in Euros so like
[40:33] of course it matters right now but what
[40:36] those bitcoiners uh want to say with
[40:38] that it's like it will not matter in
[40:41] maybe 20 30 40 years from now will be uh
[40:44] I think so too uh but right now it's a
[40:47] great signal it's like
[40:51] the it it gives the signal of of of
[40:54] Bitcoin to us all uh how how well are we
[40:58] doing right now where are we in in the
[41:01] in the journey the the purchasing power
[41:03] of Bitcoin says something about the
[41:06] overall perception of the public of
[41:08] Bitcoin I think that's that's a good way
[41:11] to to put it uh locally yeah I think
[41:15] that's that's a that's a good way to see
[41:17] it do you see it um do do you have some
[41:19] because you said like more near term
[41:21] like five years is is do you have some
[41:23] framework to think about that or uh you
[41:25] you don't want to look too far 5 years
[41:29] time greater adoption I I I see more and
[41:33] more people coming into the space all
[41:36] the time and and whenever I look at
[41:38] those charts there's there's more
[41:40] wallets there's more more
[41:44] adoption there's more people asking
[41:47] about it and and I agree I think price
[41:50] is important I think when Bitcoin hits a
[41:53] 100,000 more people are going to say
[41:57] what's this about it's just we're
[42:01] so we are so entrenched in in the price
[42:05] aspect for now so it gets people in kind
[42:08] of like you said in the beginning you
[42:10] know you come for the number go up but
[42:12] you stay for the Revolution and I and
[42:16] and I think more and more people will
[42:18] feel the pain as our governments print
[42:20] more money and as inflation continues to
[42:24] affect everybody so yeah I just see more
[42:27] and more
[42:28] adoption and I think more and more
[42:30] people will come in and you also came in
[42:33] with with creating content in the space
[42:35] uh what is it called the Bitcoin Edge uh
[42:37] is it right yeah so I just started with
[42:40] that is another way for me to try to
[42:43] find a way
[42:44] to give
[42:46] back um and get the message out about
[42:50] Bitcoin I I don't I would love to work
[42:54] and spend more of my time in Bitcoin
[42:57] um so this was just one way of trying
[43:01] something new to see um how it goes and
[43:06] yeah I I enjoy like you I enjoy speaking
[43:09] to people about Bitcoin uh not all of my
[43:12] friends want to talk about it my family
[43:13] don't I can have little conversations
[43:16] here and there but nobody wants to hear
[43:18] about it for very long and you know I
[43:20] like to be
[43:22] reminded um nobody wants to be told what
[43:26] to do so when when you create a podcast
[43:29] or you put some content out there the
[43:31] people who are interested and attracted
[43:33] to it will find you rather than trying
[43:36] to force people that I care about or
[43:40] know into it if they're interested
[43:43] they'll find it what do you think is is
[43:45] uh for people that you know that are not
[43:47] as interested in Bitcoin right now
[43:49] what's the hurdle like what is is it
[43:53] just the time missing or like what's the
[43:55] the hurdle why they don't come into
[43:58] Bitcoin now it feel like it's it's so
[44:01] obvious but maybe we're just in a small
[44:03] bubble and it feels so obvious but it's
[44:05] not that obvious I think it's lack of
[44:08] understanding and
[44:09] education because I
[44:12] think
[44:14] people's the two reasons lack of
[44:17] Education which I myself had I didn't
[44:20] fully understand Bitcoin until I read
[44:23] the price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth and
[44:25] then the Bitcoin stand
[44:27] because I didn't understand anything
[44:29] about central banks and the history of
[44:31] money I didn't know any of that and I
[44:34] and for to have one conversation with
[44:36] people you know and to put all of that
[44:38] in there is not easy they you know they
[44:42] they are lost by five minutes um
[44:48] so yeah I
[44:50] think I think education and then also
[44:53] lack of pain like we said before I think
[44:56] some people are doing quite well and are
[44:58] quite fine with how things are in this
[45:01] in this environment and I think I think
[45:04] you need either that pain Catalyst or uh
[45:08] something that brings you in whether
[45:11] it's creating a better world for
[45:13] everybody because I you know the world
[45:16] is going to be a better place on the
[45:17] Bitcoin standard there there's less
[45:19] reason to cheat there's it's more fair
[45:23] it I I also like that I like that places
[45:27] Africa will will
[45:30] not have to use the the US dollar and
[45:35] all over the world will not have to use
[45:37] the US dollar but they can have another
[45:40] system that is more equal to everybody
[45:44] than than being controlled by
[45:48] say the
[45:51] top this is this is such a big thing
[45:54] when we think about uh the the US dollar
[45:58] having such
[45:59] an amazing power over the world they can
[46:03] just export their own inflation like
[46:05] that that's something nice you can just
[46:08] Sprint and make others pay in parts for
[46:12] that like that's an that's a very nice
[46:15] business model was the US USA US Dollars
[46:18] has there going uh really really
[46:20] interesting um
[46:22] but I think Bitcoin might bring it down
[46:26] and I hope uh especially that that
[46:28] Bitcoin will bring it down uh but
[46:30] anyways if you have Bitcoin you you're
[46:33] not relying on that even if it doesn't
[46:35] go down because I rather concentrate on
[46:38] on building something than to to fight
[46:40] something down H it's it's always always
[46:43] easier and better to do that um closer
[46:46] to the end of the podcast um I always
[46:49] ask one question to my guests what can
[46:51] we learn from you besides Bitcoin and
[46:53] all the things that we talked about well
[46:56] I think the thing that I'm most
[46:58] passionate about besides Bitcoin is
[47:00] holistic health and you know before I
[47:04] got into real estate I've been in the
[47:06] health and fitness industry my
[47:09] whole life before that and you know I I
[47:14] realized as as I went through that you
[47:17] can be fit and not healthy you can you
[47:20] can look good on the outside but not be
[47:22] healthy on the inside so health holistic
[47:25] health is a more
[47:27] complete view of Health it it involves
[47:31] managing stress it involves getting good
[47:33] sleep it involves eating high quality
[47:37] foods and drinking high quality water
[47:39] and it also involves your purpose and
[47:43] happiness because you can have all of
[47:45] that and if you're not happy and not
[47:46] living your purpose what's the point so
[47:50] I like holistic health um and and it has
[47:55] worked for me I I haven't missed a day
[47:57] of work in over 20 years I have a very
[48:02] strong immune system and I believe it's
[48:04] because I put of a lot of that into
[48:06] practice not perfectly but I've been
[48:08] doing it for a long time and so yes I I
[48:13] do believe health is wealth
[48:16] but but Bitcoin is also part of that
[48:20] wealth uh I also need to be financially
[48:23] in the right place to enjoy my health so
[48:26] I need both definitely if you have to
[48:28] choose it's always Health but you you
[48:31] you you need both because if if if you
[48:33] are healthy and not wealthy over time
[48:36] your health will also suffer from that
[48:38] so it's it's it's they kind of they kind
[48:40] of need each other um on that topic is a
[48:43] really cool endrine question where we
[48:45] have the endrine the previous guest is
[48:46] asking a question for the next guest
[48:47] without knowing who the next guest is H
[48:49] your question is what is the one dream
[48:52] which you would spend a big chunk of
[48:54] your Bitcoin on that's a good question
[48:57] would spend a big chunk on of my Bitcoin
[49:01] on on a home that I really
[49:05] loved a home I would spend it on a home
[49:09] and traveling with my family those are
[49:13] the two things that I would spend my
[49:14] Bitcoin on yeah home comes up uh I think
[49:17] a lot with with Bitcoin as they want
