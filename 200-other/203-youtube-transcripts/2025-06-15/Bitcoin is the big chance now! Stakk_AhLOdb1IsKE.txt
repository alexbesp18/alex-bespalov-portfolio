[00:00] convenience will be the death of the
[00:01] West we are seeing like a breakdown of
[00:04] this iron grip that the dollar has on
[00:06] payments across the world our mission is
[00:08] to make sure that Africa does not miss
[00:10] out on the incredible opportunity that
[00:12] is presented by Bitcoin we've never seen
[00:14] an asset like this that provides this
[00:16] power there is a level of disrespect
[00:18] that Africa receives globally you have
[00:20] the IMF coming into African nations
[00:23] constantly boring them this money that
[00:24] they print out of tin here and then
[00:26] taking out their full resources Bitcoin
[00:28] now allows African countries to use
[00:31] their natural resources to mine Bitcoin
[00:33] therefore creating their own money what
[00:35] is the point of siging up a bank account
[00:37] and putting your money there it's it's
[00:39] like signing up to be
[00:41] robbed what are you both doing in the
[00:43] African uh Community what what does
[00:46] Bitcoin especially do like for your
[00:48] region and what do you what are you
[00:50] seeing there well I would say right now
[00:52] uh in terms of what value are we adding
[00:55] in the in the Bitcoin space in Africa uh
[00:58] we uh basically doing our very best with
[01:01] education uh we hope that our show uh
[01:05] gets out to the people in Africa since
[01:07] we're Africans uh the familiarity will
[01:09] help even though we're not speaking the
[01:11] local languages there's a lot of
[01:13] languages on the continent uh but I was
[01:15] sure Focus you know get some of that
[01:18] familiarity uh have more of you know the
[01:20] Africans in the space being visible
[01:24] being accessible so we're doing a lot of
[01:26] that and each time we go to we're back
[01:28] on the continent we basically always
[01:30] trying to orangr peel people uh trying
[01:32] to connect with people in the space as
[01:34] well uh I don't think it's time to start
[01:37] at least for for us to start trying to
[01:39] develop deps on Layer Two or anything
[01:42] like that for Bitcoin I think the core
[01:45] Focus right now is education and that is
[01:47] what we focused on and that's what we've
[01:49] been doing so each time each time we on
[01:51] the ground we're trying to be there uh
[01:54] educating people and when we're not
[01:56] there we're doing that through our show
[01:58] all the way here in the states what
[01:59] would you is the current like state of
[02:02] Africa and Bitcoin like is it widespread
[02:05] what's the percentage wise adoption like
[02:08] what do people in Africa don't get about
[02:11] Bitcoin like what's the hurdles that you
[02:13] see when you educate people it's
[02:15] definitely split you know I want to say
[02:18] like a half and half sort of deal there
[02:20] is people who have uh access right and
[02:24] that also means access to the knowledge
[02:26] and access to you know uh purchasing
[02:30] Bitcoin and and things like that trying
[02:33] to transact with
[02:35] it um but on the other hand you know
[02:38] there is a huge population as well that
[02:43] still has the the same technology but
[02:45] they just do not have the information so
[02:48] for where it is and I think and this is
[02:50] also part of our mission right overall
[02:55] here you know um with what we're doing
[02:57] with stack and for the adoption of
[03:00] Bitcoin overall is to make sure that
[03:04] Africa does not miss out on the
[03:07] incredible opportunity that is presented
[03:09] by Bitcoin right because this is one of
[03:12] those things where you know unlike any
[03:15] other time in mind kind like anyone else
[03:17] would agree we've never seen an asset
[03:19] like this that provides this sort
[03:23] of
[03:24] power to the people right so um yeah
[03:30] right now it is very clear to me at
[03:32] least you know recently I was in Addis
[03:34] and I noticed that there is people who
[03:35] know about Bitcoin and those people
[03:38] would be like you know I mean they
[03:40] operate with it and treat it the same
[03:42] like you and I would but then there's
[03:45] also the other group of people that uh
[03:48] they've either never heard of it or
[03:50] everything they've heard about it is
[03:51] that it's a scam so there is the
[03:55] correction that needs to happen there in
[03:56] the first place to to get people to
[03:58] realize that Bitcoin is not camp and
[04:00] then getting them to understand the
[04:02] incredible
[04:04] opportunities that Bitcoin
[04:06] presents y I like to answer that too
[04:09] because know the continent is huge right
[04:11] so there's the eastern hemosphere
[04:14] western and southern hemosphere right so
[04:16] the Eastern atmosphere like Kenya Hades
[04:19] like you said Egypt those guys are on it
[04:22] um Western you have Nigeria you have
[04:25] Ghana that I'm familiar with that I know
[04:28] that are either on
[04:30] already on the layer two technologies
[04:32] peer-to-peer Solutions Etc South Africa
[04:36] I'm not too familiar with that aspect of
[04:38] the country but I I keep an eye on
[04:40] what's going on the on the on on on the
[04:42] Bitcoin Network and I do see a couple of
[04:44] big purchases on that part of the
[04:46] continent as well but in terms of
[04:48] talking to people
[04:50] underground yeah there are people that
[04:53] that are in it for
[04:56] the peer-to-peer
[04:58] uh or trying to make money because if
[05:02] you look at it their currencies are
[05:03] constantly being devalued so there's
[05:06] that Arbitrage approach where people say
[05:08] hey I can buy Bitcoin right with either
[05:12] my cousin's account on binance or
[05:14] somewhere in another country get it
[05:15] transferred and sell it to somebody that
[05:17] cannot easily buy it on the continent
[05:19] for a higher price so people are using
[05:22] that approach as well so plus we can
[05:24] also look at it as people have it tough
[05:27] right so they're not thinking of a
[05:29] evolutionary technology that would that
[05:31] would free them from the from from neoc
[05:34] colonization the thinking of it of oh I
[05:37] got to fit my family this technology
[05:39] allows me to do that it's quite volatile
[05:41] it goes up and down they trade it and
[05:43] make money that way to provide for
[05:45] themselves but what we're trying to do
[05:46] is that yes you can do all of that but
[05:48] you actually need the technology to free
[05:51] you from new
[05:52] colonization that's part of what we're
[05:54] try to
[05:55] do yeah very good and and when you
[05:59] encounter people like what's the case
[06:01] for for Bitcoin in in Africa like why
[06:05] like what will Bitcoin do for for the
[06:07] African country in in in general because
[06:10] I think uh everyone will benefit from
[06:13] from Bitcoin I think that even the last
[06:15] person that will get into Bitcoin will
[06:18] benefit from it greatly uh but uh
[06:22] especially countries uh like America who
[06:26] have the Federal Reserve uh they have an
[06:28] incentive to
[06:30] not have a Bitcoin standard because they
[06:32] have the US dollar standard and they
[06:33] have a lot of force over the world
[06:35] because of that but I think countries
[06:38] who are not in this position as the US
[06:41] dollar and the and America is they have
[06:44] a way greater incentive to try something
[06:47] like uh uh Bitcoin like as Salvador also
[06:51] is trying right now and really
[06:52] aggressively what's what's your thoughts
[06:54] on on that for
[06:56] Africa
[06:58] well question
[07:00] that's a good question the biggest
[07:01] question of the century yeah that's a
[07:03] good question that's a good question so
[07:06] here's here's maybe maybe we can talk
[07:08] about some things that are
[07:11] happening because these are the things
[07:13] that need to change right and I think
[07:16] that Bitcoin definitely presents
[07:18] opportunity for these things to change
[07:20] so if we look at for one um there is a
[07:24] level of
[07:26] disrespect that Africa receives globally
[07:30] right I think Dr Arana chori who was uh
[07:34] she used to be African uh un
[07:38] representative to the USA she speaks
[07:40] about this as
[07:42] well and
[07:44] um even when we have things like the G7
[07:47] Nations Global you know leadership
[07:50] meetings uh where Africa is part of
[07:53] those meetings you right it's a thing
[07:55] where they are
[07:56] not uh involved in those meetings as
[07:59] partic ipants it's almost like they're
[08:01] Spectators and then the West gets to
[08:04] decide what they want to do and then you
[08:06] know pass that information onto Africa
[08:09] most recently I think that uh the new
[08:13] the form of disrespect that many African
[08:15] leaders have been actually pointing out
[08:18] is this idea of the West trying to tell
[08:21] uh African nations what they can or
[08:23] cannot do you guys can buy this now you
[08:26] guys cannot buy this now you can trade
[08:28] with this person you cannot trade with
[08:29] that person is uh and the list goes on
[08:32] and on I'm sure double you probably add
[08:34] some things that I'm I'm missing here
[08:36] fire away right yeah but that's the
[08:39] first thing the disrespect right on a
[08:42] global scale that Africans are facing
[08:44] all the time I think that is one of the
[08:45] things that we need to change which is
[08:47] happen and we can dive into how Bitcoin
[08:49] help that uh then I mean when you look
[08:52] at from a the global market
[08:57] standpoint I mean we've all heard before
[08:59] you know Africa is the richest continent
[09:01] when it comes to Natural
[09:03] Resources uh yet if you look at the
[09:05] global market indexes you see they only
[09:08] have Egypt and Kenya in there they don't
[09:10] have all the other countries that you
[09:12] know are clearly uh sometime they skip
[09:15] the entire continent yeah exactly
[09:16] sometimes it skip the continent right
[09:17] and it's like all the way at the bottom
[09:20] then you have this uh other side of
[09:22] things where you have African nations
[09:25] using French
[09:27] currency right and uh and then you have
[09:30] the French have that full ability to
[09:33] devalue or debase that currency as they
[09:35] see it to fit their own
[09:38] agendas and and any African leader that
[09:40] has come through tried to make a change
[09:42] to this situation I think we've seen
[09:45] that they all of them had the same fate
[09:47] whereas Patrick lumumba Sankara and I
[09:50] think we start to see that they're all
[09:51] trying to accomplish the same sort of
[09:53] thing and they all
[09:56] failed if you apply Bitcoin
[10:00] into this same
[10:02] situations right to solve the same
[10:04] problems like let's talk about say
[10:06] Gaddafi for example trying to uh he
[10:10] pushes forward this idea of United
[10:12] States of Africa having a separate
[10:14] currency Y and there is someone you can
[10:17] go take out it's like ethereum right if
[10:21] a if a bunch of people uh if if a bunch
[10:24] of people start transacting etherum and
[10:26] they don't like how it's going they'll
[10:27] just go find V vitalic and team and say
[10:30] hey change this that's the same thing
[10:32] all right that's the same failure that
[10:34] we see with with Fiat currencies right I
[10:37] think Gaddafi's idea was spectacular
[10:40] but he's a person and he can be taken
[10:43] out and we saw that with Bitcoin there
[10:45] is no one that uh you can go take out if
[10:48] the people start using Bitcoin as their
[10:50] means of medium of
[10:52] exchange right and so having that and
[10:57] then having that ability of uh Sovereign
[11:00] moneyy as a state right that also now
[11:03] starts taking you taking you out of the
[11:05] clutches of um you know three yeah right
[11:10] for the other three letter organizations
[11:12] system exactly and that starts now
[11:15] taking us back to the respect which I
[11:18] mentioned at the beginning of this
[11:20] because I think no nation is going to be
[11:22] able to get uh the full respect that
[11:24] they deserve if they don't even control
[11:26] their own value so I think that's the
[11:29] major use case for this in Africa and
[11:31] and we can get into the demographics of
[11:34] Africa and all that stuff and why I
[11:35] think this is you know I think Africa is
[11:37] going to be one of the uh biggest
[11:41] beneficiaries of this Bitcoin adoption
[11:43] thing what are your thoughts on that
[11:46] fire on brother um so I would just like
[11:49] to add to that right so one of the big
[11:51] word is sanctions right left and right
[11:54] sanctions everywhere uh right now Ghana
[11:57] could be sanctioned because it's not
[11:58] accept of the lgbtq plus policy that the
[12:02] United States is trying to push for them
[12:05] same in Zimbabwe same in Kenya uh so we
[12:08] have that right so if you operate on the
[12:10] Bitcoin standard while you on a network
[12:13] or a blockchain or a Time chain uh that
[12:15] cannot be uh
[12:18] sanctioned it cannot be stopped African
[12:20] is that heavily majorly right now then
[12:23] there's the aspect of governance uh it's
[12:25] a public chain right and as we know the
[12:28] say African has one of the most corrupt
[12:31] uh countries but we know they're not
[12:33] corrupt just because they are corrupt
[12:35] the Western countries are enable them
[12:37] the mon is that they are stealing are
[12:39] all going back into Swiss bank accounts
[12:42] you know UBS accounts and you know they
[12:44] they get the banks get fine just a
[12:46] little bit just for them to continue to
[12:47] do the same
[12:50] AML if AML was really working um Africa
[12:54] would not be that corrupt so yes a
[12:55] public blockchain like Bitcoin will
[12:57] enable for Trans current governance
[13:00] across African nations that will be
[13:02] major and then of course the money
[13:04] policy uh since we had the BR to Wood
[13:06] agreements after World War II we first
[13:08] use US dollar nobody's going after the
[13:10] US dollar it's just that currently
[13:13] actually it's been like that ever since
[13:16] uh the US dollar has been
[13:18] abused uh it's
[13:21] been I mean you saw what they just did
[13:24] with Russia uh taking all their their
[13:27] assets right so and you have the IMF
[13:29] coming into African nations constantly
[13:32] borrowing them this money that they
[13:33] print out of tin here right and then
[13:36] taking out their full resources right
[13:38] Bitcoin now allows African countries to
[13:41] use their natural resources to mine
[13:43] Bitcoin therefore creating their own
[13:46] money their own real money so instead of
[13:48] you worrying about the Russians
[13:50] hijacking your gold mines your Cobalt
[13:52] mines and Etc ET do that your own
[13:54] country mind your own
[13:56] Bitcoin have your own Unbreakable
[13:59] money life is great and another issue
[14:02] that one of the reasons why actually
[14:03] I've quit my job before to move back to
[14:05] Africa uh to start a business one of the
[14:08] major issues that I saw was the fact
[14:09] that InterContinental trade was weak
[14:13] they rather trade with Europe they ride
[14:15] a trip with e China and Russia but
[14:18] African and African countries are not
[14:20] trading because of your currency got to
[14:22] go all the way through the Swift system
[14:25] back to Europe exchanges before you can
[14:27] even trade with your Neighbor Next Door
[14:29] right because the US dollar is the
[14:31] standard form of trade if you use a
[14:33] Bitcoin standard it's a global format of
[14:35] trade and you can trade with one another
[14:38] you can build website sell your sell
[14:40] your resources uh with Nations nearby
[14:44] and Far Away there's just so much sense
[14:46] that Bitcoin can fix on the continet I
[14:49] I'll point out like um we are seeing
[14:51] like a breakdown of this uh ion grip
[14:56] that the dollar has on payments across
[14:58] the world MH where you know for example
[15:02] like Russia right they now transacting
[15:04] rubles they accept payment for gas and
[15:07] rues I think they even accepted Bitcoin
[15:08] one time for payment and uh I think
[15:11] Egypt as well they stop using the dollar
[15:14] and so I think with with with this
[15:17] breakdown it seems like a great
[15:20] opportunity uh
[15:22] to have Bitcoin and Bitcoin will be
[15:25] right one of those
[15:27] prominent um how would you say assets or
[15:31] means of money that will be in the
[15:33] future Financial system
[15:36] unquestionably yeah 100% and uh but I
[15:39] see that I'm I'm even like a little bit
[15:41] angry because we have the US dollar with
[15:44] such a huge power H what is is like six
[15:47] 66 countries use the US dollar as their
[15:50] actual currency not even like uh as a
[15:54] site like they use the US dollar as a
[15:56] currency so they can uh Outsource they
[15:59] can export the inflation uh they can
[16:01] print money and let the other countries
[16:04] pay for them and on top of that on top
[16:06] of the financial aspect they can just
[16:08] rule the world with like oh you you're
[16:10] not like if if you don't behave that way
[16:14] uh you don't have access to that one or
[16:15] you get sanctioned that one it's like
[16:18] where are we living like that's that's
[16:20] not fair to anyone ex and even Americans
[16:24] agree with that that if they get Bitcoin
[16:26] they're like of course it's not fair and
[16:29] America also um I mean they are quite
[16:32] good honestly with the Bitcoin adoption
[16:34] especially way better than European
[16:36] Union is but it's not better than the
[16:39] European Union uh but I think the best
[16:42] Grassroots movement is in Africa I think
[16:45] the is the strongest country I think
[16:48] Nigeria I think
[16:50] for nuts
[16:53] yeah they been in the top five of
[16:56] countries that transacting Bitcoin yeah
[17:00] yeah yeah is there is there something
[17:03] else like if let's imagine we are on a
[17:06] Bitcoin stand let's imagine uh the whole
[17:08] world they don't have fear currency they
[17:10] don't have National things like nobody
[17:12] has say anything about financial
[17:14] currencies which like by the way like I
[17:16] I recently heard the news with with
[17:18] Swiss like Swiss banks didn't allow
[17:20] Russia assets to leave like that's like
[17:24] we always say like Bitcoin is like a a
[17:26] Swiss bank in your pocket no Bitcoin is
[17:28] is now better than a Swiss bank in your
[17:30] pocket way better Obama said that in his
[17:33] most recent interview yeah it is better
[17:35] than a Swiss bank way way better better
[17:38] it is better it's a lot more secure too
[17:41] yeah and you actually have control of it
[17:44] and you
[17:46] don't
[17:49] absolutely it's pretty much like um cash
[17:52] right which you're trying to uh maybe
[17:55] store by yourself except you know not
[17:57] under a mattress this time
[17:59] is this time is
[18:01] digital right and you can send it across
[18:04] the worldall peer to peer I mean that's
[18:06] just the most incredible thing it is is
[18:08] really shocking to me that the world is
[18:10] still ignoring this thing uh at the rate
[18:12] that they are it's a really mindblowing
[18:15] but I also understand it's going to take
[18:17] time for everyone to understand Bitcoin
[18:19] but it's almost like once you
[18:21] do it transforms your brain almost trans
[18:25] your entire brain yeah yeah and and I
[18:28] think that's one that's what we focused
[18:31] on is how do we transform the African or
[18:34] reset the African brain uh to
[18:37] understanding money yeah cuz that's the
[18:39] biggest challenge and we've had several
[18:40] shes what we said our mindset has been
[18:43] manipulated to the point that we don't
[18:45] even understand our store of value uh
[18:48] what we're doing right now is value
[18:50] being created to the world right and
[18:53] that is currency it's a form of currency
[18:56] but we store it probably store it in x
[18:59] or or or YouTube and they will get that
[19:01] value and they will give us a little
[19:03] sprinkle of it if they ever choose to
[19:05] because you know you got to have certain
[19:07] number of views etc etc etc that is what
[19:10] Fiat is doing to us on a daily basis
[19:13] it's actually worse on the African
[19:15] continent because not only do we have
[19:17] bad rulers I don't want to call them
[19:19] leaders we have bad rulers but our abil
[19:22] to store value is being killed by the
[19:25] regular inflation out of bad policy
[19:28] making but also external decisions being
[19:31] made on the US dollar that has nothing
[19:33] to do with the folks on the ground but
[19:35] they still get impacted on that and then
[19:37] there's global trade you can't compete
[19:39] on the global level because you cannot
[19:41] uh manufacture you don't have energy
[19:44] it's just so many things that now
[19:46] Bitcoin comes in and helps like the
[19:48] issue of energy on Africa on on the
[19:50] African continent it's a big thing
[19:52] infrastructure but we got Rivers Water
[19:55] major water like hyro yeah
[19:59] super sunlight I mean we have oil and
[20:02] gas all that is can can help with the
[20:05] infrastructure of energy and also help
[20:08] create the ability for us to store value
[20:10] but for some OD reason maybe it's the
[20:13] younger Generations in Africa that gets
[20:14] it out the older Generations that have
[20:16] been in charge since so-called
[20:18] Independence yeah will not let go
[20:21] definitely I mean I think I think it's
[20:23] definitely a younger generation sort of
[20:24] thing you know so I was you know I'm
[20:26] from Cameroon right so I was born by the
[20:29] time I was born you know there was some
[20:30] sort of like a um overthrowing of the
[20:34] president who was there essentially the
[20:37] actual president being removed and the
[20:38] West putting their own leader in there
[20:41] and that same guy has been there to this
[20:44] day and I think throughout my life you
[20:48] know it's really just been sitting there
[20:50] watching the same thing over and over
[20:52] again right the people Revolt they met
[20:55] with violence senseless violence which
[20:57] is actually ongoing right now now M and
[21:00] then you know you go back and settle
[21:02] down and then you try to do it again
[21:04] you're met again with violence so it's
[21:07] almost like you have these leaders there
[21:09] who are set there to keep the uh people
[21:13] in check and away from their own
[21:16] prosperity and growth right and I think
[21:19] what has been very difficult about
[21:21] overcoming this is this violent aspect
[21:24] the fact that the people will never ever
[21:26] have the arms to overthrow
[21:29] these governments even though we're now
[21:32] starting to see that in places like Bina
[21:33] Faso Mali and all these other areas
[21:35] right which is not publicized at all
[21:38] these are African nations that have
[21:39] straight up told the West to leave their
[21:41] environment and they have um and I think
[21:45] there are some very powerful changes
[21:47] happening in those areas um which again
[21:50] not
[21:51] publicized but these are some of the
[21:54] things that we're keeping a close eye on
[21:55] and and hoping to uh take every
[21:58] opportunity that arises to contribute to
[22:01] that growth now I think having that
[22:05] having that ability to
[22:07] store your own value and it not being
[22:11] able to be manipulated by any
[22:13] centralized entity it definitely
[22:16] presents that unique opportunity where
[22:19] we can achieve that change of changing
[22:22] our our governance without
[22:25] violence that is what I'm really excited
[22:28] about with this because if the people
[22:30] are opt out of using the money which is
[22:33] which is the fake money which is being
[22:34] printed and handed over to them and use
[22:36] to control them then I think there has
[22:40] to be some different outcomes from that
[22:43] I cannot you know sit here and say that
[22:44] is 100% going to be successful but to be
[22:47] honest uh we have not tried anything
[22:49] else so why not right so that's that's
[22:54] that's one I'm excited about for this
[22:59] yeah and Bitcoin is our best shot at
[23:00] this right we we we don't have like what
[23:03] else would we do like it's sometime
[23:04] interesting for me to think about like
[23:06] what would I do when there's no Bitcoin
[23:08] I don't know maybe gold uh but but gold
[23:10] has inherent problems with globalization
[23:13] and
[23:14] digitations uh maybe I would do a lot of
[23:16] real estate but real estate has a lot of
[23:19] problems stocks has a lot of problems
[23:20] like I'm so glad that Bitcoin is there
[23:23] uh before I did a lot of uh stocks uh
[23:26] and I loved it but uh I'm glad that that
[23:29] Bitcoin is there right now and you also
[23:31] mentioned EML like uh the the the KC EML
[23:36] uh stories and I think especially in the
[23:39] EU is there there's a lot of regulation
[23:41] on that and we now also heard the news
[23:45] with Samurai and the Phoenix wallet
[23:48] Samurai Founders arrested and the
[23:51] Phoenix wallet taking off the US uh
[23:54] store like I I feel like there is like a
[23:56] a war on privacy everything has to be
[23:59] noted down you you have to uh get to
[24:02] know like your customers in every step
[24:04] of the way is it also the same way in in
[24:07] Africa and this madness also going on
[24:09] with
[24:10] you what in
[24:12] Africa so um actually that's one of the
[24:15] things that got us banned on Instagram
[24:17] well we we were just talking about what
[24:19] what was happening uh and we got banned
[24:22] for that but you know I think that it is
[24:25] worse in Africa in the sense that and
[24:28] just maybe you look at it differently
[24:30] but I think it is not functional in
[24:33] Africa this bands and things like that I
[24:36] don't think is actually functional I
[24:38] mean yes they control a lot of they can
[24:40] control the internets and things like
[24:41] that but you know there's this thing
[24:42] called VPN which I'm pretty sure
[24:45] everyone that is is is interacting with
[24:47] these things is using uh and I say it's
[24:50] not functional because Africa does not
[24:52] have the infrastructure to enforce
[24:53] certain type of things neither do the
[24:56] people have uh the level of
[25:01] access and information like we would
[25:04] here in the US like there's a lot of
[25:06] things that we we take for
[25:08] granted uh here just because of the
[25:10] level of uh infrastructure and
[25:12] technology that is available to us so I
[25:15] believe that uh at least for me the way
[25:17] I see it
[25:19] is as the younger generation uh
[25:22] continues to uh move up and it is the
[25:26] biggest Young Generation
[25:29] or young population right globally in
[25:32] Africa um it just seems to me that we
[25:35] are in a position to continuously
[25:37] outsmart this um ancient people that
[25:41] we've been dealing with and the ancient
[25:43] mindset that we been dealing with on
[25:45] these people uh it's kind of like
[25:47] remember when we're we're discussing one
[25:48] time about Nigeria having paratroopers
[25:51] dropping dropping of the city okay so
[25:55] there there was this one video which was
[25:58] just circling around the wild back which
[26:00] it showed uh the Nigerian military
[26:04] doing Tri exercises exercises middle of
[26:08] the day in their own country right so
[26:10] you have these people just going about
[26:12] their day the roads are barely there
[26:15] right a lot of the infrastructure is not
[26:16] there it's almost like they're living in
[26:19] the past or something and all of a
[26:21] sudden you have uh military falling you
[26:23] know soldiers falling out of the sky the
[26:25] financial system and the enforcement the
[26:28] things they trying to enforce and the
[26:30] reality of what is happening that's how
[26:32] I see it it's like having a a gate but
[26:34] then there is a pathway to just walk
[26:36] around it kind like what they did with
[26:38] binance recently yeah yeah yeah yeah so
[26:41] I I I would add to the old AML situation
[26:45] right if if AML was working on
[26:49] Fiat right they would not need to the
[26:54] difficulties of it on cryptocurrencies
[26:56] will not be a big issue yeah it's not
[26:59] working in fat we all know
[27:01] that we all know that but the the the
[27:05] the narrative is that oh
[27:07] cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin is been
[27:10] used for illicit activities for
[27:13] terrorism but before Bitcoin existed in
[27:18] 2009 Africa has been the best place for
[27:22] you to go and steal money and take it to
[27:24] to the West so that's one thing and then
[27:27] Nigeria for examp example introduced the
[27:29] enira right so maybe that could be a way
[27:30] for them to like kind of know what's
[27:32] going on that failed miserably because
[27:34] the people do not trust government
[27:37] people rather transfer transact in
[27:39] cash or in Bitcoin and other
[27:43] cryptocurrencies before they even touch
[27:45] any government oriented system uh
[27:48] there's also Solutions like matching
[27:49] corer that uses just regular phone
[27:51] numberers so you don't need a digital
[27:52] phone uh or a digital wallet really it's
[27:56] still a wallet though but you know it's
[27:58] in uh a different technology compared to
[28:02] the uh internet web
[28:05] Technologies so there there there are
[28:08] multiple solutions that Africans are
[28:09] always coming up with to solve their
[28:13] financial problem and still get around
[28:15] the old AML situation within the country
[28:19] sometimes even outside of the country
[28:21] dude some of this African nations you
[28:23] put your money in the bank and you're
[28:24] not even sure you're going to be able to
[28:25] withdraw it happens to me all the time I
[28:27] can't take my dollars out when they go
[28:28] yeah so it's like you what is what is
[28:30] the point what is what is the point of
[28:34] uh signing off a bank account and
[28:35] putting your money there and you can't
[28:36] even you know it's it's like signing up
[28:38] to be robbed why are we doing this yeah
[28:42] you and that's that's why this stop this
[28:45] is why this education is super important
[28:47] yeah and the banks have the biggest
[28:48] buildings in every city that you go to
[28:50] by the way that's
[28:52] true it's it's it's also true in Austria
[28:55] uh is is there war on privacy uh with am
[28:58] like this I feel like there's a global
[29:00] war going on against the privacy of the
[29:03] citizens this is this is just my
[29:05] perspective on this but I think that
[29:07] right now uh the African perspective on
[29:10] privacy is different from what we're
[29:12] dealing with in the west given that
[29:14] they've not been exposed to some of the
[29:17] things that we have here right I think
[29:22] it's probably more of um an approach to
[29:26] all the rageous side line that so
[29:28] introducing systems that do not even uh
[29:33] enable that privacy if you
[29:36] will so like like you were saying with
[29:39] the uh introducing the EA right uh it's
[29:42] a lot more difficult I think it would be
[29:44] a lot more difficult to actually roll
[29:46] out those cbdcs so the cbdcs here in the
[29:49] US because people have experienced what
[29:52] they imagine was you know private
[29:54] banking and then having to shift over to
[29:58] government control this government
[29:59] controlled open
[30:01] system I think it's easier to introduce
[30:04] something like that in an environment
[30:06] where you know they've not been exposed
[30:08] to it as much uh versus trying to
[30:10] convert you know the US yeah I can see
[30:13] what R is saying to though because most
[30:15] of the applications or the systems that
[30:17] we use in Africa are built in the west
[30:20] so if the West is attacking those
[30:22] systems and saying you cannot have a
[30:25] node or you cannot have your own private
[30:27] wallet or you cannot have an anonymous
[30:29] wallet you must kyc your wallet why do
[30:32] you need to know how much money I have
[30:34] in my wallet like if I was working down
[30:35] the street and I made some money and
[30:37] someone paid me cash the government does
[30:39] not need to know that someone paid me
[30:40] cash for my walk down the street but
[30:43] that that is the future of the cbdc that
[30:45] they want to put in place uh but
[30:48] Africans man uh I know we're talking
[30:51] about peaceful Revolution those people
[30:53] would turn a big red high on you if you
[30:55] best with their money yeah cuz they work
[30:57] so hard work so hard for the money and
[31:00] right now a lot of them still prefer
[31:02] cash because they just don't trust the
[31:03] system I told you a lot about 21 Bitcoin
[31:06] the best place for me to buy Bitcoin
[31:08] directly on a Bitcoin only exchange but
[31:11] now let's talk about how to secure your
[31:14] Bitcoin once you got Bitcoin you don't
[31:16] want to leave them on Exchange you want
[31:18] to take self custody you want to take
[31:21] responsibility of your own Bitcoin
[31:24] that's why I recommend getting a bitbox
[31:27] bitbox is an amazing wallet where you
[31:29] can not only keep your Bitcoin in a
[31:32] simple way very secure you can even
[31:34] create a pass phrase with that
[31:37] passphrase you can basically create a
[31:39] hidden wallet on the device itself make
[31:43] sure to buy your bitbox in the link down
[31:46] in the description and with code Robin
[31:48] you even get a 5% discount when I talk
[31:51] with African
[31:53] bitcoiners cbdc is not so much on their
[31:56] mind uh because because they know they
[31:58] are like a little bit more resistant to
[32:00] that I think German would be so easily
[32:03] like they CBC let's go digital Euro
[32:05] let's let's adopt it there's a digital
[32:07] wallet there's some tax incentive there
[32:09] like I think it would be really easily
[32:11] rolled out in in in the European Union
[32:14] with with the people uh and and
[32:17] apparently I don't know uh for sure but
[32:20] you know it better it's it's different
[32:21] in in Africa is it like the e i I heard
[32:25] about it like this was the first kind of
[32:26] project that failed
[32:28] extremely uh like cbdc is not something
[32:31] that you're worried about or is
[32:33] it why
[32:35] cbdc might be successful in the in the
[32:38] in the west is because of people are
[32:40] super
[32:41] comfortable you know we got used to the
[32:43] credit cards and then we got used to
[32:46] just swiping away and now you can use
[32:49] your Apple phone and just tap tap and
[32:51] boom it's paid for so they're not
[32:53] connecting the dot that you've just
[32:55] given Apple the power to know everything
[32:58] that you spend your money on this is why
[33:01] you now get advertisement Facebook from
[33:03] all the different social medias Amazon
[33:06] just currently abusing your your your
[33:09] your your psychology so you end up
[33:11] spending more than you actually make
[33:13] because they're constantly pushing ideas
[33:16] of what you can buy to you right so
[33:18] we've lost that sense of self now we
[33:20] have systems and corporations that
[33:23] actually control us and in the West A
[33:25] lot of people are like that like
[33:27] literally their mindset is social media
[33:30] constant selling buy buy buy byy buy so
[33:33] cbdc is just oh it's automated now or
[33:36] the government can just automatically
[33:38] take taxes you know we F talked about
[33:40] tax situation which people are just not
[33:43] connecting the doubt that no it's just
[33:45] do value government and money should be
[33:48] separated they do not need to know that
[33:50] in Africa people are very tight with
[33:53] their money they really close man they
[33:54] will go to the bank and throw a major
[33:56] Feit over some smaller amount of money
[33:58] because they can't access their money
[34:01] yeah there'll be arguments at the bank
[34:02] every
[34:03] day I can
[34:07] see uh like what do you guys
[34:10] mean yeah uh I think yeah I think cbdcs
[34:14] is uh as long as Bitcoin exists I'm not
[34:17] worried about
[34:18] cbdcs uh I think the cbdc thing is going
[34:22] to be more entrapment of the
[34:24] lazy people will refuse to learn uh and
[34:29] I've kind of said I've kind of
[34:30] frequently said this on our show that uh
[34:32] convenience will be the death of the
[34:35] West um because things have been made so
[34:38] easy for
[34:40] people that they just keep you know
[34:43] gliding along no one is willing to go
[34:47] through some discomfort in order
[34:49] to get to a better place and and it
[34:52] makes sense because people people
[34:54] generally do not like change right but
[34:57] as long as Bitcoin exists I do not see
[35:01] how I do not see a scenario where cbdc
[35:04] actually wins I think the point in time
[35:07] when uh Bitcoin could have been hidden
[35:10] from society as a whole has definitely
[35:13] passed the time for 51%
[35:16] attack at least from my perspective I
[35:19] still think the time has passed some
[35:22] people will mention Quantum Computing
[35:24] but I guess we'll only have to wait and
[35:26] see
[35:28] as long as uh Bitcoin is running as it
[35:31] was intended right and whatever people
[35:35] do to it and it does not does not fail I
[35:38] think uh we all have to be looking at
[35:41] that and acknowledging it as Bitcoin as
[35:43] as a whole right we have to be looking
[35:45] at that and acknowledging that we are
[35:47] winning every
[35:49] day because you know the government is
[35:51] not going to let us know that that we're
[35:53] winning against them they don't want
[35:55] this is this is you know people were
[35:57] winning will not come out making
[35:59] Publications saying that you should not
[36:01] go buy from exchanges that
[36:04] are okay people who are winning will not
[36:07] start going after uh their opponents to
[36:10] arrest them such wallet right and and
[36:13] it's not even their opponents you know
[36:15] it's just people are doing better than
[36:17] them people were proving that there is a
[36:19] better way to do the things that we're
[36:20] doing right now this is one thing that I
[36:23] I I also strongly believe at this point
[36:26] in time this
[36:28] structure of governance that we have I
[36:30] don't know if it's globally but I'll
[36:32] speak for the W specifically I don't
[36:33] think that it is still uh capable of
[36:37] governing Society in this day and age
[36:41] the reason I say that is because this I
[36:44] think if lockdowns did anything right
[36:46] it's kind of put all of us in this place
[36:48] where we got to really see everyone
[36:50] across the globe and my conclusion is
[36:53] that there is way too way too many smart
[36:56] people out here especially on X okay way
[36:59] too many smart people for us to be
[37:01] governed by the group of people that
[37:03] we're being governed by right now okay
[37:05] if you combine people like Elon and I
[37:09] know insert the name of your favorite
[37:10] smartest person that you have come
[37:12] across here these people robinn
[37:15] yeah exactly right uh these people have
[37:19] dropped so much
[37:21] information uh to the public that
[37:24] anywhere you are these days right you've
[37:26] probably gotten more use for information
[37:28] in your life than CNN through these
[37:31] people yeah who are supposed to be lead
[37:33] us so that needs to change and I think
[37:36] that part of that change comes within
[37:38] Bitcoin because there is no way that as
[37:42] a society we can pick up this level of
[37:44] intellect and then go back to using fake
[37:48] money 100% And I think um it's it's such
[37:52] a powerful thing when you think about it
[37:55] uh Bitcoin has kind of already
[37:58] and we are so far ahead and I think
[38:00] there's at this point nothing that can
[38:02] stop Bitcoin but even if we
[38:05] theoretically say there's something
[38:06] happening with Bitcoin like even like I
[38:08] don't know in five years it dies off
[38:10] because of something I don't know um
[38:13] even then the idea is still valid this
[38:16] idea of sound money the austan economics
[38:18] size of things uh those things are valid
[38:21] and we are as a Bitcoin Community now a
[38:23] group together that is holding really
[38:25] strongly together we connect ing every
[38:28] day I'm every day on a podcast with
[38:30] someone else like we are all like a
[38:32] really huge and Powerful group of people
[38:35] that want sound money we would spin
[38:38] something else up like we we want sound
[38:40] money we are not giving up just because
[38:42] something fails I I think Bitcoin will
[38:45] never fail I think uh Bitcoin will
[38:47] succeed and we'll uh have we have sound
[38:49] money for for the world in in 10 years
[38:53] 50 years 100 years whatever uh the
[38:55] timing is always tricky to to predict uh
[38:58] but even even when we don't succeed like
[39:02] there is a group of people that really
[39:04] want some money and they're sticking
[39:05] together and they they are willing to
[39:07] fight for for that future and that's
[39:09] that's something beautiful honestly it's
[39:11] it's it's nice to see so many people
[39:13] agreeing on something and going forward
[39:15] and and doing something it's like I
[39:17] don't know if you're a lot on on bitcoin
[39:19] conferences but it's always a magical
[39:20] experience when you have so many great
[39:22] people in in one place and and and and
[39:25] and celebrating together
[39:27] absolutely well I think I think it' be
[39:29] great for answers every
[39:31] day x just get an X and I think yeah
[39:35] that Bitcoin conference is also every
[39:37] day as long as you're holding the
[39:38] Bitcoin no it's like this one thing that
[39:43] is is the
[39:45] truth and you can either accept it or
[39:47] not yeah so 100% what's your thought on
[39:52] the Bitcoin indf uh like blackr has
[39:55] buying is buying now a lot of bitco Co
[39:58] um what's your thoughts on the the
[40:00] launch uh did you like it uh or what
[40:03] like did you were expecting uh the
[40:05] massive buyings did you expect the
[40:07] outflow like it's interesting to to see
[40:10] what what what bitcoiners are thinking
[40:12] of the Bitcoin
[40:13] ETF yeah so um we have strategy sessions
[40:18] at stack uh just to figure out uh
[40:21] processes for efficient money because
[40:24] just like you said you started out with
[40:26] stocks as well we did stocks for the
[40:28] longest uh we used to have a channel
[40:30] where we used to talk about the next
[40:32] stock to trade and we used to use
[40:34] several AI to before a was was a big
[40:37] thing uh to look for the next move the
[40:39] next day and um a good story was when we
[40:41] found about Neo the pump up of Neo AMC
[40:45] and gme using this AI tool and we got on
[40:49] the trade we woke up the next morning we
[40:50] were up several thousands of dollars and
[40:53] to find out that we were frozen out of
[40:55] the system we could not exit our trade
[40:58] that was one of the worst part of our
[41:00] Lives trading in the Fiat stock market
[41:02] right so we're like no that's got to be
[41:04] a solution all right we started out with
[41:07] with kadano But to answer your question
[41:10] though I was buying big cenes was like H
[41:13] remember this guy was than selling
[41:17] selling I was making that mistake yeah
[41:20] cool so when the ETF came I was like
[41:23] okay here's the solution they either
[41:25] trying to get us back the double
[41:27] printing because now you can extend the
[41:29] amount of Bitcoin that exists this is my
[41:32] conclusion of what ETFs are
[41:34] doing because not only are you not
[41:38] buying the 21 million limited Bitcoin
[41:41] you're not buying this concept of a
[41:44] Bitcoin that somebody else owns for you
[41:46] or holds for you and charges you a fee
[41:48] to hold for you that you can never
[41:51] actually owe the real assets or the real
[41:53] commodity right so that is one aspect of
[41:56] thinking of the ETFs but then we'll
[41:58] think about it we'll give the banks our
[42:01] money most people think about that
[42:02] that's just a convenient way just put
[42:04] your money at the bank the bank hold it
[42:05] for you pay you a little fee whereas the
[42:07] money is no longer yours they've loan it
[42:09] out they've made a lot of money that's
[42:11] exactly the same thing the ETF is doing
[42:13] just trying to make it simple for folks
[42:14] not going into the old technical Finance
[42:16] aspect of it Black Rock buys out the
[42:19] Bitcoin charges your fee to all the
[42:23] Bitcoin and they can do anything they
[42:24] want with that Bitcoin to scale it you
[42:27] know they can uh long calls short calls
[42:30] you know open uh all the different tools
[42:34] that you can use to scale and expand on
[42:36] that asset that you have they can do
[42:39] that they can shut it they can long it
[42:42] they can take out loans on it etc etc
[42:45] Black Rock gets a lot much richer while
[42:48] you just watch the charts and see it go
[42:51] up and down up and down limited return
[42:54] but this is what we did you cannot win
[42:56] in the fear space I mean you can try to
[42:58] win you have a limited amount of winning
[43:00] you can do so one of the things that we
[43:01] was okay we have our retirement accounts
[43:04] if we take money out we're going to have
[43:05] to pay some major fees uh we get taxed
[43:07] here in the US for taking money out of
[43:09] our retirement account oh like hey he it
[43:12] man we're gonna take some money out at
[43:14] least one that my current employer
[43:16] managers we took some money out but
[43:18] we're not paying the fees because we got
[43:19] to pay the money back and we then use
[43:21] that money to buy the actual Bitcoin
[43:24] which is actually performing better than
[43:25] our retirement accounts
[43:27] and then the retirement account with our
[43:29] previous employers I just went and
[43:31] bought ibat like okay you want to play
[43:34] the game I would just buy some of that
[43:36] within my time account to buy the
[43:38] Bitcoin ETF to buy a marathon to buy uh
[43:41] to buy a riot you know to buy MST so
[43:44] that's what I did inside those accounts
[43:47] as my way of as my play of the Bitcoin
[43:50] uh
[43:51] Revolution and and you said also before
[43:53] that you were uh before not in Africa
[43:56] and now moved back because of you wanted
[43:58] to start a business there like uh you
[44:00] were before in
[44:02] America so I I've been I've been in
[44:04] America forever uh but um I co-founded
[44:07] an airline with my with my with my
[44:09] childhood friend we grew up together I
[44:11] went to Niger by the time I got to
[44:13] Nigeria I found out that my name has
[44:14] been removed from the company's
[44:16] ownership so I got screwed and then I
[44:19] came back to the us to start all over
[44:20] again okay and now you're both in the
[44:24] US oh okay okay okay uh I'll going back
[44:27] though I'll be going back mistake about
[44:29] that well I'm actually you
[44:33] know I'll put it this
[44:35] way a lot of Africans at this point in
[44:38] time okay are hearing the call from the
[44:43] motherland and uh you'll be hard pressed
[44:47] to find an African these days that does
[44:50] not have a plan or I think it is it is
[44:52] slowly becoming more and more evident
[44:54] every day that it is way more more
[44:57] advantageous for us to
[45:00] um be back in the African continent and
[45:05] engaging in
[45:07] business because the potential for the
[45:11] future is something that I cannot even
[45:14] begin to
[45:15] explain you can think of it like a
[45:17] Bitcoin Bull Run maybe just a little bit
[45:20] less because it's society and things
[45:21] will move a little bit slower resistance
[45:25] yeah and you don't have the charts like
[45:28] uh for in Bitcoin it's amazing because
[45:30] you have the price chart to watch when
[45:32] something's going on it's like but you
[45:34] don't don't have a African chart where
[45:37] you're like oh
[45:40] afri maybe we need an African chart we
[45:43] do have we do have some sort of an
[45:44] African chat so if you look at foreign
[45:46] investment on the continent yeah uh the
[45:50] the SI situation is that they actually a
[45:52] lot of them are investing in
[45:54] fintex right uh um some they're not
[45:58] investing in agriculture they're not
[46:00] investing in infrastructure they're not
[46:02] investing in energy fintech fintech
[46:05] fintech and what does fintech do banking
[46:07] system pull the resources out squeeze
[46:10] the people out but the money is going in
[46:13] there though that's the interesting part
[46:15] so yeah that's the chart that we get to
[46:17] see is that China is coming in Russia is
[46:20] coming in heavily and the United States
[46:22] is lacking behind even though they are
[46:24] still turning a lot of money into
[46:26] fintech uh startups um so the way we see
[46:30] the chart right now is that development
[46:32] in Africa might be slow but foreign
[46:35] investment from the Chinese and Russian
[46:38] is moving in super fast so what the
[46:41] Africans outside outside of the
[46:43] continent doing just looking on the
[46:44] sidelines before you know it's going to
[46:46] be like Jamaica or some of these island
[46:49] nations where it's all foreigners are
[46:51] own the land and the actual uh
[46:55] aboriginals uh don't own anything kind
[46:57] of like what happened to ad yeah well as
[47:01] just I'm saying I don't think that uh as
[47:04] much as that looks like that's what can
[47:05] happen I just don't think that's what
[47:07] will happen
[47:08] anymore um simply for the fact that uh
[47:11] there is definitely a a strong of rising
[47:14] happening
[47:16] across uh multitude of African nations
[47:19] right now and at the pace that these
[47:21] things are happening I think the trends
[47:23] are going to definitely change direction
[47:27] for
[47:28] sure and one thing that mentioned was
[47:33] you know the Chinese and and Russian
[47:35] Investments that are coming in there uh
[47:39] I think one of the main things are just
[47:41] different and you know the when it comes
[47:44] to the Western Nations like the US and
[47:47] France I think their approach which
[47:50] brings us back to this uh this respect
[47:53] issue uh the approach over the years
[47:56] have not been
[47:57] uh ones that have been
[47:59] productive for the African communities
[48:03] uh versus what we're seeing with Russia
[48:05] where it's an attempt at
[48:07] collaboration to also build within the
[48:10] environment that they're doing business
[48:12] with this people so those are the things
[48:15] that I'm uh looking forward to seeing
[48:18] how they evolve and and participating in
[48:21] them as well of course really cool yeah
[48:25] it's um it's so fascinating for me to
[48:28] see that we are living through a huge
[48:31] change uh I mean I think the most
[48:35] glamorous example is is El Salvador
[48:37] because it's all over our feets in EG uh
[48:40] and I've talked with a lot of el
[48:42] salvadorians and you can just see if
[48:44] like a country that was literally on the
[48:47] bottom like I think Salvador with the
[48:49] highest murder rate with with the
[48:50] economic situation uh they were like on
[48:53] the bottom of the list and now they
[48:56] actually have a president who gives out
[48:58] free passports to Skilled people he's
[49:01] adopting a Bitcoin standard he's getting
[49:03] rid of the gangs like he is doing a lot
[49:06] of great work it's beyond Bitcoin even
[49:09] uh um so it's like not all contributed
[49:12] to bitcoin of course but it's a lot of
[49:14] of of great work that he does uh and the
[49:17] country is getting more and more
[49:18] attractive like people from the outside
[49:20] want to live there I interviewed already
[49:23] two El salvadorians that were living
[49:25] outside of El Salvador and now moved
[49:27] back because of
[49:29] nauk and uh this can happen to all
[49:32] countries that are um that want to move
[49:36] forward that they want to be brave and
[49:38] and and embrace new technology uh
[49:40] regardless if it's Bitcoin if it's it
[49:43] systems AI anything like you have to
[49:45] embrace the new systems and that's how
[49:48] you get advantage over the the the US uh
[49:52] the US uh stuff like that so it it it's
[49:55] really interesting to to see that
[49:57] playing out in real time and I don't
[49:59] know if I stay in Austria all all the
[50:01] time because I see it also like as you
[50:03] mentioned before I think the the vest is
[50:05] getting convenient and they uh they
[50:07] don't know what hard work is like I work
[50:10] 12 to 14 hours every day from Monday to
[50:13] Sunday H but I am like a small exception
[50:17] in my friends group there are few
[50:20] obviously high performance doing a lot
[50:22] of work uh and I don't even consider it
[50:24] work because I'm just like doing Bitcoin
[50:26] content which
[50:27] Feels Like Heaven to me uh but that's
[50:30] another story and most people are so
[50:33] replaceable I I go to usual parties with
[50:36] non- bitcoiners and I'm I'm talking with
[50:38] them I'm like your job will be replaced
[50:41] in five years at latest with some EI
[50:44] thing like you you will be replaced like
[50:47] so
[50:49] quickly you will
[50:51] not see it coming and that's that's
[50:54] interesting to to live through but what
[50:56] all what I missed in the beginning is uh
[50:59] like your orange pilling story like how
[51:01] did you get uh in into Bitcoin and the
[51:04] most important question of course who
[51:05] got it first from the to both of
[51:08] you yeah so I got I got the Bitcoin
[51:11] first and um to to be honest I feel like
[51:14] I got orange Pew
[51:17] twice because I would say I I probably
[51:20] orange PE my myself the first time
[51:23] because when I first I actually need to
[51:26] look on
[51:28] Rob so I I initially bought Bitcoin I
[51:31] was buying it somewhere on U between
[51:35] cash app and Robin Hood we checked like
[51:37] the first times when I was buying it on
[51:39] cash app was like
[51:40] $8,000 for Bitcoin but back then I was
[51:43] buying it when I bought it back then I
[51:46] did not even buy it because I was trying
[51:48] to necessarily make some profit even
[51:50] though I did sell it quite a few times
[51:52] to barely make profit uh but just
[51:55] reading the description of it
[51:57] it spoke to me for sure spoke to your
[52:00] soul yes it definitely spoke to my soul
[52:02] by just reading the description of it
[52:03] the first time uh but then I did not
[52:06] really take a deeper dive into it I just
[52:09] bought it and held it I'm like all right
[52:10] I guess I'm one of you know I should be
[52:12] early on to be having this thing let's
[52:14] see what happens to it next right like
[52:16] what's going to happen next are we going
[52:18] to be able to pay for things is are the
[52:20] banks going to start accepting it uh but
[52:23] L did I know we're not going down that
[52:25] road at all and so um I think I started
[52:29] exploring cryptocurrencies as a
[52:32] whole double
[52:34] out now we get that the whole [ __ ] Corin
[52:37] races hey man you got to tell them the
[52:38] kadano story know which one is that oh
[52:42] yeah well we bought a lot of cardano
[52:44] comp you know yeah use all sorts of
[52:49] crazy pancake Swap and other wonderful
[52:52] deck yeah dexes and lending platforms
[52:56] and
[52:58] we've done it all
[53:00] um then then then I think the second
[53:04] time I got red pill was in the middle he
[53:06] got to Miami and um I think this is a
[53:10] something by Mark Moss yeah Mar
[53:13] Moss I forgot the name of it but it was
[53:15] this was an event by Mark moss and um I
[53:18] remember I was speaking to this I met
[53:20] this chick there and she
[53:22] was cool chick we're friends and we
[53:24] started talking about uh blockchain
[53:26] technology and she will not talk about
[53:28] anything outside of Bitcoin but she was
[53:30] just
[53:33] very about anything else it was Bitcoin
[53:37] or nothing else but uh I think her
[53:40] conviction of Bitcoin is what really
[53:43] made me go back and go well how is this
[53:45] person this way and they would not
[53:47] listen to anything else and so I really
[53:49] took the opportunity to really start
[53:50] taking a deep dive that's when I started
[53:52] falling down the rabbit hole and ever
[53:55] since then it's you know just
[53:58] been transformation of my mind in in
[54:02] many different ways man it forces you to
[54:04] learn more
[54:05] things this is how I came across this
[54:08] actually because of Bitcoin where I sat
[54:10] there and watch a whole semester of of
[54:13] Economics from MIT no it was not just
[54:18] econ whatever they're teaching here they
[54:20] Chicago school that's also when I came
[54:22] across the videos of Gary ginsa teaching
[54:25] blockchain technology at MIT as well um
[54:29] and then yeah then I started diving into
[54:31] you know that's when I found a macro
[54:34] Point Austrian economics as well sorry
[54:36] about you know started reading this is
[54:38] uh you may have seen the Austrian
[54:39] economics uh website they give out these
[54:42] books uh for
[54:43] free
[54:45] so it's it's I think yeah the thing is
[54:49] it's more than a just money or for
[54:52] medium of exchange it's it's really
[54:54] something special because it transforms
[54:56] as a person as well for the better I say
[54:59] that if you if you take the time out to
[55:02] really study it and get it sure yeah um
[55:07] my journey is I think I think is funny
[55:09] um so I paid up on my debt got married
[55:14] and I was like all right um we just got
[55:17] funding from a series a investor time to
[55:19] quit my job and moved to Nigeria so on
[55:23] my way out it's like I got a research
[55:24] where to put some of my savings
[55:26] so I like okay I found out about
[55:29] blockchains um I did not know where to
[55:31] buy Bitcoin at the time but I knew my
[55:33] you my youngest brother was buying
[55:35] cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin I was like
[55:38] hey here's a $1,000 doll buy some
[55:41] Bitcoin I just give him the money went
[55:44] to Nigeria focus on because you know
[55:46] sometimes when you focus on your
[55:47] business you just got to focus on
[55:48] business alone long story short
[55:50] everything happened with the business
[55:51] two years later I'm back in the states
[55:53] starting all over I like hey what did
[55:55] you buy my brother said they bought bro
[55:57] I was
[56:00] like so we call him bro now it's a joke
[56:03] the strongest coins on Earth my guy so
[56:06] it got be Pro um it always looks like
[56:08] it's growing up but it's never growing
[56:12] up so I know my B B pro was but um so
[56:16] long story short um he and I got
[56:19] together we started working on stack uh
[56:21] started trading the markets and long
[56:24] then he said Kenny we should check out
[56:28] then we read into kadano of course we're
[56:30] very passionate about the African
[56:31] continent we saw what kadano was doing
[56:33] in Adis Ababa we looked at what the the
[56:36] the the network was doing all the
[56:37] development people hated kadano so much
[56:41] at the time I was like why do they hate
[56:43] Charles ainson well now we know why
[56:45] people hate him uh but we're putting our
[56:48] energy into the space we're promoting
[56:50] cadano we actually giving out kadano for
[56:52] people that follow our show at one point
[56:54] we should probably not be saying that
[56:55] because the is is going to come after
[56:57] some history lessons um but then yeah we
[57:02] went we went for we went to the Bitcoin
[57:03] conference uh m m uh and then we
[57:07] actually had a chat with him and said
[57:09] you guys need to look deeper into this
[57:11] and after he mentioned that we all came
[57:13] home uh and we started reading more
[57:16] about it and I think ever since reading
[57:17] the Bitcoin standard for me uh it's been
[57:19] a different story I thought I knew what
[57:21] money was cuz I was always big into
[57:23] Finance investing in real estate
[57:25] investing in stuff Market ETF starting
[57:27] up my own business you know doing
[57:29] everything that you think you need to do
[57:30] to get your money to grow to have to
[57:32] have value so that it doesn't get killed
[57:34] by inflation but then you realize you
[57:36] can you can keep fighting I mean you can
[57:38] make it to the
[57:40] 5% uh of the people that are super rich
[57:43] uh after fighting your way up but you
[57:44] still have inflation and Taxation to
[57:47] constantly fight with all it takes is
[57:48] for Gary Gins to come out and say we're
[57:50] increasing interest rates yeah so um
[57:53] that's that's that was the transition
[57:55] for me and for me it was a lot much
[57:57] harder for him because I had a
[57:59] technology background so having gone to
[58:02] school for technology I saw blockchains
[58:04] as uh kind of like how people see eum oh
[58:08] you can now do this on the blockchain
[58:09] it's a software it's it's a Enterprise
[58:11] architecture in the cloud but then when
[58:13] you start understanding Bitcoin
[58:15] understanding money it's like no
[58:17] somebody else is still controlling it we
[58:19] are trying to get away from that that is
[58:20] the solution that we need to focus on
[58:22] right now like decentralized money take
[58:24] away Central Authority from from the
[58:26] control of your power your energy your
[58:28] store
[58:30] value yeah Beautiful Stories man really
[58:34] cool uh kadano I never went in I was
[58:37] just a little bit in ethereum or some
[58:38] some other smaller [ __ ] coins uh but
[58:41] kadano I I I avoided from from the
[58:45] start forun but I I lost a lot of money
[58:48] also I also did the whole Celsius
[58:51] thing I I I think I got some money back
[58:54] like a few weeks back from it like it
[58:56] was like oh I actually got get something
[58:58] back from that it's interesting uh but I
[59:01] I I regret that massively so I think
[59:04] everybody has has his faces and and and
[59:07] getting slower slower to to the Bitcoin
[59:09] Bitcoin world I have a question for you
[59:12] have you been Rock
[59:14] before uh
[59:17] what rock rock pool rockpool oh Rock
[59:22] pool yes like you put your money in The
[59:25] Exchange some coin or some wallet and it
[59:28] just gone I actually did not do it like
[59:31] I I I like I did not do it but uh I also
[59:34] did not experience that in total Celsius
[59:37] was the closest thing to that but I got
[59:41] I think 70% of my money back something
[59:43] like that so it was not that bad I still
[59:46] got like they still stole my money yeah
[59:50] and they still messed up in a big way
[59:52] but at least I got like the majority
[59:54] back which which feels not not that bad
[59:57] uh and and yeah
[60:00] but Extreme rck pull not not really I I
[60:04] invested in a shitcoin that went just
[60:06] down like 80% so I lost 80% of the
[60:10] really small amount that I put in there
[60:12] uh which is yeah also not that bad
[60:15] because it was like not even 1% of my
[60:17] portfolio was just like a a small play
[60:20] which was stupid uh but yeah we all have
[60:23] to make our mistakes I guess
[60:26] uh that's good to learn definitely
[60:28] definitely um before we get to our end
[60:31] routine uh I have one more question
[60:33] which I'm in the last time really
[60:35] passionate about finding out what
[60:37] bitcoiners are passionate about besides
[60:40] Bitcoin so what are you currently
[60:43] learning uh doing uh whatever it is uh
[60:47] that is really where you are really
[60:49] passionate about it besides Bitcoin man
[60:52] I'm passionate about a lot of things man
[60:54] I do quite a
[60:56] uh there's there's gokart racing there's
[60:58] actual racing there's online racing
[61:01] there is uh I think I need three types
[61:03] of racing there um I think everything
[61:07] racing F1 racing yeah a lot of racing
[61:10] stuff I'm you know still passionate
[61:12] about business you know I'm always I
[61:15] think that looking at things how I I see
[61:18] them now on kind of understanding things
[61:20] on a more global scale I'm interested in
[61:23] trying to engage in more international
[61:25] business business because business has
[61:27] always just been a passion of mine as
[61:29] well so wherever there is an opportunity
[61:31] to provide a solution to a certain issue
[61:36] right I think that it it always strikes
[61:39] my interest to be able
[61:42] to um provide you know a solution to
[61:47] that and to be able to gain from
[61:49] it um other than that I think you know
[61:52] just learning all the new things that
[61:54] are coming out even though just seems
[61:56] that things are just uh changing these
[61:58] days at a pace that is almost uh
[62:01] unsustainable to keep up with but I try
[62:04] to learn as much as I can about um new
[62:08] things yeah keep it pushing that
[62:13] way it's a tough question I think it's a
[62:15] really tough question because I
[62:17] personally feel like my life has been
[62:19] one of constant adaptation so I might
[62:22] really love doing something for now and
[62:24] then over time I'm after to transition
[62:26] to something else for most of my life it
[62:28] was soccer um playing soccer all the
[62:31] time um but then not having married
[62:34] having kids um I can't do much of that
[62:38] anymore plus I messed up my knee uh
[62:39] playing soccer so I have you know put
[62:42] that on the side but as BR said which is
[62:44] one of the things that I think brought
[62:45] both of us together is that we're very
[62:47] passionate about problem solving uh in
[62:51] the business area or in even in the in
[62:53] the workforce uh when I was much younger
[62:56] my dad asked me what I wanted to do so
[62:58] he gave me this book and said hey this
[62:59] are all the different careers choose one
[63:02] I knew I always loved Aviation when I
[63:04] was a kid actually my my son now loves
[63:07] uh space and and aircraft and everything
[63:11] I probably get it from me so I wish him
[63:13] the best uh but I've I've tried that
[63:16] passion of mine um things happened I've
[63:19] let that passion go so my new passion is
[63:22] just again simp problem solving uh which
[63:25] is one why we're in the Bitcoin space
[63:27] and doing education now so what we're
[63:28] doing right now is is our passion uh
[63:31] trying to get the education out there
[63:32] teaching people about what money really
[63:34] is uh saving their lives and then you
[63:37] know my my my grandmother taught me a
[63:39] lot so I we have a nonprofit on our
[63:42] behalf um and we when I go to Nigeria
[63:46] what I'm doing is giving back um paying
[63:49] for people's
[63:51] education um again educating people and
[63:54] just helping out the community so I
[63:56] think that's where my passion
[63:59] stays beautiful beautiful I love it um
[64:03] we have an inro in the podcast which is
[64:05] really interesting where the previous
[64:06] guest is asking a question for the next
[64:09] guest uh without without knowing who the
[64:12] next guest uh actually uh is uh um your
[64:16] question um is uh what is freedom for
[64:21] you what is
[64:23] freedom that's a really good question
[64:25] got to go fast yeah I think I already
[64:27] have my answer I have my answer Freedom
[64:30] oh man I wish I had my background of
[64:34] because U if I was at my station on this
[64:37] interview my background is freedom with
[64:40] a Bitcoin sign in the middle uh and
[64:44] being a second Twin because I'm a twin
[64:46] right that's been my drive ever since
[64:49] because it's always the first twin in on
[64:51] the African culture that gets everything
[64:54] that you know it's the is the seni your
[64:56] brother and all that stuff like no I got
[64:58] to do things my way so part of that
[65:01] freedom is even changing my name so my
[65:03] name is k in eura right which means the
[65:06] second born you're always like the the
[65:08] the refer to the next like you're not
[65:10] you're not first you're not you're not
[65:12] you're not free to express yourself so
[65:14] it's now called Kenny uh kenet you know
[65:17] uh she handsome young fellow you know uh
[65:20] just part of my own Freedom story but
[65:22] back to your question about what's
[65:23] freedom freedom to me is it's it's
[65:26] really your ability to be able to
[65:28] express yourself to be yourself without
[65:31] the external pressure or forces that try
[65:35] to put you in the box right and I would
[65:39] say in sever of our recordings CU I'm
[65:42] not religious but there's this book
[65:45] of exis in the Bible that talks about
[65:49] what money is and you know and it says
[65:51] money is everything literally everything
[65:53] that we do is stored in money
[65:56] that's the technology that we human
[65:57] beings came up with many many years ago
[66:00] to to be able to start store our value
[66:02] instead of trade by batter because there
[66:04] was no way to transfer that already
[66:07] created energy right from the US to
[66:09] Africa with the value that you've
[66:11] created without some Central Authority
[66:14] saying you cannot do that like you are
[66:17] so you're everybody's a sovereign human
[66:19] being the borders is a construct of what
[66:22] this authorities or this establishment
[66:24] that's put in there right right freedom
[66:26] is being able to get get yourself away
[66:28] from that right freedom is is your
[66:32] ability for for for us for also to have
[66:34] this communication without someone
[66:36] saying no you cannot do that you know
[66:39] that's that's freedom for me and I
[66:40] believe that Bitcoin allows us to do
[66:42] that you know if they want to ban you on
[66:44] on X go to ner they cannot ban you on
[66:47] nster um uh if you want to transact with
[66:50] somebody in Russia because you have
[66:52] family members in Russia you have the
[66:54] freedom to do that nobody can ban you
[66:56] from doing that if you want to help
[66:58] other people you have the freedom to
[67:00] send them money to do that nobody can
[67:02] ban you from doing that the story goes
[67:04] on and on and I think for me a started
[67:06] since my childhood because I've always
[67:07] having to push back and push back and
[67:09] push back and now you you also have a
[67:11] technology that supports that so to me
[67:14] that's what freedom
[67:16] is all that's that's beautiful very cool
[67:19] I'll give you guys my answer
[67:21] here freedom is your natural state
[67:24] you're born into this world if free
[67:25] human being that's Freedom okay there is
[67:30] no
[67:31] laws and all those other things when
[67:33] you're born into this world right it's
[67:35] like can think of you like a wild
[67:38] animal okay that's what freedom is and
[67:41] so at that point in time it's now up to
[67:43] you to be able to make the right
[67:45] choices to maintain your
[67:49] freedom because I think a lot of times
[67:51] people look at Freedom as do whatever
[67:53] you want it is natural state that you're
[67:56] in and then you have to apply discipline
[68:00] making those right choices right to
[68:03] maintain that
[68:04] freedom you may have heard this saying
[68:06] there is discipline in there is freedom
[68:08] in discipline y right so that is what it
[68:12] is setting your morals setting your
[68:14] boundaries setting your rules and then
[68:16] doing everything to uphold those things
[68:19] for yourself and for the people you love
[68:22] without
[68:23] intervention from foreign entities like
[68:27] governments right because the only thing
[68:30] that is standing in the way of our
[68:32] freedom is other
[68:34] people putting socaled guidelines with
[68:37] the backing of
[68:40] violence that's what it is right whether
[68:43] they come and arrest you and throw you
[68:44] in jail or shoot you whatever the case
[68:46] might be you see people have exercise
[68:49] their freedom get taken out by other
[68:52] people who felt threatened by other
[68:54] people EX izing their freedoms so that
[68:57] is what freedom is to me that's the
[68:58] first thing because that is the
[69:01] most uh how can I say
[69:04] urgent and most realistic thing that
[69:06] we're dealing with right now right so
[69:10] freedom is that ability to maintain the
[69:15] value that you earn right based on the
[69:19] choices that you make
[69:22] and having all of that happen in a
[69:24] sovereign manner that's
[69:26] that's that's also very extremely
[69:28] beautiful um I love that question
[69:30] because it it's uh such an important
[69:33] question and what most don't realize
[69:35] that freedom is not free like you you
[69:38] have for freedom you always have to
[69:40] fight uh like the the freedom is like
[69:42] basically the ability to say no to
[69:45] everything and yes to everything that
[69:47] you want uh and that's like uh it's hard
[69:52] to
[69:52] accomplish uh but in in in general like
[69:55] you have to work for it you have to be
[69:57] disciplined in order to for yourself and
[70:00] for others to achieve the the freedom
[70:02] you want um it was a really cool talk
[70:05] with you uh I could go on for like
[70:07] another two hours probably uh but I
[70:11] think we we we will make uh the same
[70:14] thing on your channel also and I will
