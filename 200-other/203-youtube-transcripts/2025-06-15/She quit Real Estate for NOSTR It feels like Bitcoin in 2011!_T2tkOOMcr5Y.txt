[00:00] we've seen it now in Brazil they banned
[00:02] Twitter what is happening after BTC
[00:04] Prague literally 5 days later I quit my
[00:07] Fiat job all my savings I put them all
[00:10] like long-term investment into Bitcoin
[00:12] Master could now be what Bitcoin was in
[00:14] 2011 you can choose your own algorithm
[00:17] on nosta that is impossible on X or
[00:20] Instagram one of my friend in Brazil
[00:23] last week they just randomly closed a
[00:26] bank account with no reason I'm on
[00:28] Primal and then I was putting in my
[00:31] private key on highlighter and then
[00:34] everything was there what I do not have
[00:36] to set up a new profile in new
[00:42] picture I heard you t uh worked in real
[00:45] estate before like is that right yeah
[00:48] like back in um 2015 I moved to London
[00:52] after
[00:54] University and then I worked um in
[00:58] London until
[01:00] 2019 2020 just before the pandemic
[01:04] happens um yeah started there
[01:08] like very basic uh as a kitchen Porter
[01:12] because I needed money quickly like when
[01:14] I came there I just had a one-way ticket
[01:16] with 500 EUR and I needed money so and
[01:18] my English was so bad that time and then
[01:21] I um yeah moved to uh a hostel as a as a
[01:27] receptionist and then I was like okay
[01:30] you know what where can I where can I
[01:33] find a decent job where where can I earn
[01:35] money where can I uh make a career um
[01:38] and then I applied for the biggest uh
[01:41] real estate company in London and they
[01:44] offered me a training position and then
[01:48] yeah things got wild what did you do
[01:50] that I'm just fascinated by it because I
[01:52] know so many bitcoiners that have some
[01:55] background in real estate it's it's a
[01:57] fascinating connection for me yeah um so
[02:00] I like normally you start as a trainee
[02:02] then become a consultant um but I was uh
[02:06] I'm German and I'm a woman so I was very
[02:08] ambitious so they like that so
[02:11] apparently German people can work hard I
[02:12] don't know are on time like these basic
[02:15] kind of things so and I became manager
[02:18] actually so after one and a half years
[02:21] um and um yeah so I had my um own office
[02:26] and then you just like sell houses you
[02:29] uh houses you have your trainees you
[02:32] have your team um and that's yeah was a
[02:36] very crazy Market um that was quite
[02:40] um difficult like these uh these times
[02:44] and days but like the real estate
[02:48] industry is like a crazy job I mean you
[02:51] work like 80 hours a week like Monday to
[02:54] Saturday is super competitive and very
[02:58] intense um
[03:00] yeah that's what I did interesting
[03:02] because of you said that on time uh I
[03:05] have some podcast with like Swiss and
[03:07] German people also and with podcasts all
[03:10] around the world and it's a weird thing
[03:13] that happens everyone in the world is
[03:16] like like one minute early there maybe
[03:19] five minutes late there and the German
[03:21] people are the only people that are
[03:23] sometimes uh in the in the chat already
[03:26] like 5 minutes early or 10 minutes early
[03:28] when I'm going in there like oh already
[03:30] here so it's it's interesting to see
[03:33] that that that concept that actually
[03:34] German people uh and swiss people are
[03:37] like way earlier there it's just I just
[03:39] wanted to to point that out it's it's an
[03:41] interesting story really cool that you
[03:44] come from Real Estate but you never
[03:45] invested in real estate you just like
[03:47] worked in real estate yeah I worked in
[03:49] real estate um I mean I did earn a lot
[03:52] of money there but I spent everything
[03:54] because nobody told me about money so I
[03:56] was like I mean I was like mid end 20s I
[03:59] was like oh my God like you know there
[04:01] is money there's always money so just
[04:03] spend it like you just buy everything
[04:06] and um yeah I wish back then
[04:11] anyone had told me about money explained
[04:15] me the money and I was just like oh is a
[04:18] is a never- Ending Story because you
[04:21] know you just work and you get the money
[04:23] and um but obviously that was not the
[04:26] case and and then you hope for
[04:28] retirement at at at some point and
[04:30] hopefully there's enough yeah that's
[04:33] that exactly um but I mean house prices
[04:37] in England were like are still
[04:39] crazy but like when I came to London and
[04:43] saw like that a basic studio is like
[04:46] half a million I was like holy [ __ ] this
[04:50] is like this is so
[04:52] expensive but a lot of people can afford
[04:55] it um that's very um um crazy but yeah I
[05:03] I never thought about like investing
[05:06] back then like I don't I don't know
[05:09] why yeah like it comes lateer in in life
[05:13] I see it with a lot of guests um with
[05:15] your insights from Real Estate even
[05:17] though you did not invest in there but
[05:19] as as a real estate market I think is a
[05:21] completely overpriced and a lot of
[05:22] people misuse real estate and houses as
[05:26] their personal savings account for some
[05:27] reason um why should someone like get
[05:30] into Bitcoin buy Bitcoin and not real
[05:33] estate uh do you have some insight from
[05:35] Real Estate and now also with with
[05:36] Bitcoin that's I mean that's a very
[05:39] interesting and difficult question to to
[05:42] answer um right now all my savings I
[05:45] have if I have them I put them all like
[05:48] long-term investment into Bitcoin um I
[05:51] will not um trust uh the real estate
[05:56] industry especially also I'm in Berlin
[06:00] absolutely I mean I I can't afford
[06:02] something to buy here you need a huge
[06:04] deposit and with Bitcoin for me is is is
[06:08] easy it's for me a long-term investment
[06:11] and you just can put something aside
[06:13] doesn't matter like how much you you're
[06:17] like um saving and for me um The
[06:23] Awakening point from Bitcoin was I mean
[06:25] I started quite recently actually like
[06:28] investing in
[06:30] Bitcoin that was a year ago somebody
[06:33] like helped me in setting up all these
[06:35] kind of things because I had no idea
[06:39] where even to start and then I was like
[06:42] okay let's have this app like it was a
[06:45] relay app so and then I was doing just
[06:47] an outer investment every week and then
[06:51] it I remember when it was the beginning
[06:53] of this year I opened my wallet and I
[06:56] was like that doubled like literally
[06:59] that doubled I was like I I I took a
[07:02] screenshot and sent it to my friends
[07:04] like what what is happening here and he
[07:06] said welcome welcome this is what's
[07:09] happening here so and that was a point
[07:11] was like oh my God this has a lot of
[07:14] potential this really has a lot of
[07:16] potential and I was like wow maybe um
[07:19] that's a solution for the future so that
[07:21] was very um Awakening for me yeah I feel
[07:25] like the the number gr up technology is
[07:27] the best marketing tool for Bitcoin it's
[07:29] like it's the one thing that you just
[07:31] like cannot argue with it's like oh yeah
[07:33] it's it's it's like you you will get um
[07:37] you will be protected against that
[07:39] inflation against all all the things
[07:41] like that's the that's a best uh
[07:43] marketing was there besides that uh uh
[07:47] something that that was like oh that's
[07:49] that's interesting or did all the other
[07:51] things came later for
[07:53] you like what what you what do you mean
[07:55] can you just explain that further uh
[07:57] yeah uh for me it's like there are a lot
[07:59] of reasons why to buy Bitcoin and some
[08:02] people actually are obsessed with the
[08:04] technology uh especially young people
[08:07] that are in Tech they're like oh that's
[08:08] interesting I want to do around with
[08:10] that and then and then they come into
[08:12] Bitcoin that are a smaller group of
[08:13] people uh then there is a group of
[08:16] people that really are pissed off with
[08:18] uh transaction controls for example in
[08:21] in in Canada I think Trudeau actually
[08:24] onboarded a lot of bit bitcoiners with
[08:26] with that uh so like the freedom
[08:29] uh technology that point of view but I
[08:32] think most people uh come in because oh
[08:36] I can protect my Val oh number the the
[08:39] price goes up in that so I'm always
[08:41] wondering like was was the uh number go
[08:44] up the price the the main thing and the
[08:47] other things with freedom go up
[08:48] technology in and how uh you can
[08:51] actually transact borderless over
[08:54] continents I for I think just like two
[08:57] weeks ago I took my f my I think second
[09:01] or third payment uh in Bitcoin and it
[09:04] was the first time it really benefited
[09:07] uh uh the both parties because he was
[09:10] not in Europe so uh it's a it's a really
[09:13] struggle and so he was in America and we
[09:17] try try to kind of set it up with fear
[09:19] and then we were like hey we both are
[09:21] Bitcoin why we not just doing it in
[09:23] Bitcoin and it was such an amazing
[09:25] experience it was like Sunday afternoon
[09:27] uh and he was like okay sent me the
[09:30] payment link I sent him the payment link
[09:32] he instantly did it after uh I think
[09:35] like after one minute I got the first
[09:37] confirmation and then after like 10 20
[09:39] minutes I I got the payment already in
[09:42] my wallet I had to do no exchanges no
[09:46] fear no Bank things no accounting on
[09:48] that like it's it's such an a pleasure
[09:51] way so I think uh that the true beauty
[09:54] of Bitcoin is for me always like a
[09:56] little bit hidden behind the the price
[09:59] tag
[10:00] uh so that's why I'm wondering like how
[10:02] how you discovered it and and what made
[10:04] it so interesting for you in the
[10:07] beginning and what you learned then
[10:08] through the years yeah there's a
[10:11] combination of a few things I mean what
[10:14] you just mentioned um I like that's the
[10:17] transactions are so so easy and quick
[10:20] like um due to all the brexit and all
[10:23] these kind of things like if I have
[10:25] someone like in the UK and want to send
[10:29] them some money and we had that actually
[10:32] recently this is so so complicated try
[10:36] to do that with your bank account well
[10:38] good night the transactions fees are
[10:40] horrendous or you can have someone like
[10:43] like Is it wise or transfer wise is
[10:46] still it just takes long you have to
[10:48] confirm that and that and put that in
[10:50] and was like my gosh so but if you have
[10:53] Bitcoin well you just send them stuff it
[10:55] was like Wow and um especially like um
[10:59] I'm a huge fan of like Primal which has
[11:02] a built-in wallet so and that is just
[11:06] absolutely fantastic and amazing and um
[11:10] the other day someone um bought one of
[11:13] my books and I was like oh how can I pay
[11:15] you I was like oh just send me S like
[11:17] that's so it's like done like literally
[11:20] in seconds and I was like Wow and
[11:23] imagine like doing a normal transaction
[11:27] which is yeah just very complicated and
[11:30] then yeah I don't have patience and time
[11:33] so and the other thing is also like my
[11:37] like my savings will all be will always
[11:39] be my savings like they will be there in
[11:42] Bitcoin I don't know like I could save
[11:44] on my bank account but the money I don't
[11:47] know if the money is there you know you
[11:49] never know what's what's happening like
[11:51] with the banks and um we have seen that
[11:54] like in in history where they closed the
[11:58] bank accounts um
[11:59] like one of my like one of my friend in
[12:03] Brazil uh she just like that was like
[12:06] last week they just randomly closed her
[12:09] bank account with no reason like just
[12:12] that all her money was there I mean she
[12:15] did had like a lot of savings in Bitcoin
[12:19] but imagine that wouldn't be the case
[12:21] and was like yeah how can you pay your
[12:23] rent how can you like this is just very
[12:28] yeah horrible it's interesting a few
[12:32] days ago I just released a podcast with
[12:34] Ariel from Argentina and he talked about
[12:38] how Argentina went through basically
[12:40] hyperinflation and even like the last
[12:42] few years how the development was uh
[12:46] there and he had an amazing example he
[12:48] said like in five years ago the average
[12:52] salary in Argentina was a th000 us and
[12:56] now the average salary is $300
[12:59] in the meantime all the prices went up
[13:03] massively and he made that gas example
[13:06] paying for gas for a car uh and within a
[13:08] year the price uh tripled from like $12
[13:12] to like 36 around that time so like he
[13:16] he he's like if you just measure
[13:18] everything in dollars you notice how bad
[13:22] it actually is in Argentina and then
[13:26] they use do they use mostly dollar of
[13:28] course then
[13:29] uh and pesos and then when you measure
[13:32] that not in dollars but in Bitcoin it
[13:34] gets even crazier than that so uh I
[13:37] think the the the rational of of the
[13:41] vest of the Euro Zone and and and and
[13:44] the US is like oh no that will not
[13:46] happen to us of course it will happen to
[13:48] us like it's just it's just a different
[13:50] stage we're in like it's just a matter
[13:52] of time uh that that that comes also to
[13:56] us like we're not we're not safe from
[13:58] that
[13:59] no that's what I find very difficult
[14:02] like I'm very new into Bitcoin and also
[14:04] Noster and um there is there are people
[14:08] here in Germany or Berlin you can share
[14:10] or talk about but like my peer group
[14:13] like my friends if I tell them stuff
[14:16] about that or they are just laughing
[14:17] it's like ah yeah that's just gambling
[14:20] it's like
[14:21] okay thank you for this conversation and
[14:24] I mean my problem is like I do not have
[14:28] enough and strong arguments yet because
[14:31] I'm so new into it um but I think I mean
[14:37] I have
[14:38] experienced uh the huge benefit already
[14:41] so that's like why I'm so fascinated
[14:44] about it why I'm so into it and it's not
[14:46] about like just um Bitcoin himself as
[14:50] like um like a freedom of money is like
[14:55] the whole ecosystem the whole philosophy
[14:58] behind it the whole people behind it
[15:01] which are so absolutely amazing and like
[15:06] working so hard on having a better
[15:09] future so when I went to BTC Prague
[15:14] which was my first Bitcoin um conference
[15:17] ever this year there were that was like
[15:21] absolutely fascinating because there
[15:23] were just people who I was like oh my
[15:26] God they are so amazing they are they
[15:29] think like me um I don't have to hide I
[15:32] can talk to them and that was just
[15:37] amazing i l that a lot and you also uh
[15:40] your work now on nostr right you quit
[15:43] your job is it right yeah so um that was
[15:47] actually quite funny after BTC prag
[15:50] literally 5 days later I quit my Fiat
[15:53] job I'm still in my full-time job
[15:56] because we in Germany you have a lot
[15:59] long time to like give notice which is
[16:02] like three months but um yeah I'm here
[16:05] the last couple of weeks and I was I
[16:08] mean first I was like oh my God what can
[16:11] I bring to this community because I'm
[16:14] not a developer I have no knowledge
[16:16] about Bitcoin or
[16:17] nosta but then I realized maybe people
[16:22] and the community need people like me
[16:25] who are good in something not so Tech
[16:28] related and I'm an event manager
[16:31] fulltime I organize huge conferences
[16:35] meetups events like from 800 people to
[16:39] 10,000 people really depends on the
[16:43] client and I think that is something I
[16:48] mean I can give the community back as
[16:50] well so and this is what I would like to
[16:52] do really cool with with uh with whom
[16:55] are you working uh now well I have I
[16:59] mean I'm not working directly with
[17:02] someone I mean I I also like volunteer
[17:05] like for Ana at Amsterdam Prague for the
[17:09] bit vocation and then I would like to
[17:15] organize in South America like I will go
[17:19] to three conferences there like in
[17:21] argentinia at lab bitcon then sa Paulo
[17:24] satcom in adopting Bitcoin and I would
[17:28] like to put on a Noster Booth um with a
[17:32] community at each
[17:34] conference and to just
[17:37] like show the people um that they're I
[17:43] mean if
[17:44] you you also need freedom of speech
[17:46] right so and this is what was
[17:49] fascinating me so about nosta so and um
[17:53] yeah this is what I try to um get
[17:56] organized and need of course the support
[17:59] from a lot of people and I mean I got
[18:02] inspired by um the guys from Prague like
[18:05] Derek was and the team there just did an
[18:09] excellent job I mean that is that was
[18:13] really fantastic and like setting up a
[18:15] booth like that that's my day-to-day
[18:18] business and if I can just bring my
[18:20] knowledge in order to um yeah give
[18:24] something back that would be great I
[18:26] love that a lot yeah brag was was
[18:29] amazing um I already have like I want to
[18:32] go to next conference the next one I
[18:34] will go to is is Amsterdam I don't know
[18:36] if you're also there and then in
[18:37] November I will probably be in adopting
[18:40] Bitcoin also will be those will be my
[18:44] yeah I will be in Amsterdam oh amazing
[18:47] yeah Amsterdam will be really cool uh
[18:49] and then yeah adopting Bitcoin in
[18:51] November also in El Salvador first time
[18:52] ever in in in Bitcoin country will be
[18:55] will be really fun uh to to be there and
[18:58] and F see finally all those bitcoiners
[19:02] in real life physically actually again I
[19:05] love that always I'm trying now to get
[19:07] like every month at least to like a
[19:09] local Meetup or to some conference or to
[19:12] something where I meet some some local
[19:15] bitcoiners uh that's that's that's an
[19:17] underrated thing to do in in Bitcoin I
[19:19] feel like a lot of people like consume a
[19:20] lot of podcasts and learn a lot and do
[19:22] something but then they never really go
[19:25] out and and find someone like they they
[19:29] only have this uh family and friends and
[19:32] they try to Orange peill someone and
[19:33] that's really really really helpful for
[19:36] Bitcoin uh but they don't have real
[19:38] Bitcoin or friends in real life so I
[19:40] think that's something underrated and
[19:42] it's it's really valuable to have
[19:44] Bitcoin Connections in in real life and
[19:47] have those connections uh actually in
[19:50] real life yeah that's yeah absolutely
[19:53] true because the most I learned about
[19:56] Bitcoin or like nosta was was on a face
[19:59] Toof face conversation I mean I can
[20:01] listen to so many podcasts I can read so
[20:04] many books but my brain is just like
[20:06] overworked at one point but like I
[20:09] remember I was in Ria um two weeks ago
[20:12] at norri and we had a very nice uh
[20:16] female evening dinner and there was this
[20:19] amazing woman who explained me how money
[20:23] works like and she did it in a way I it
[20:29] was like it was like just a journey
[20:31] about history like and it was so like
[20:36] touching and it was so so real that I
[20:39] actually got it you know so and if you
[20:41] read in a book or listen this is money
[20:44] blah blah blah I was like Wow and I
[20:47] understood that and this is why I think
[20:50] also like conferences are so ex so
[20:55] important because you can physically
[20:57] show the people people this is how you
[21:00] do this this is how you um get on
[21:04] boarded or or something like that
[21:06] amazing really cool by the way how has
[21:08] your
[21:10] um family and friends circle reacted to
[21:14] leaving your job and and going into
[21:16] Nostra and what how did you explain
[21:18] Nostra to them uh well I it's still
[21:22] tricky to like explain nosta to myself I
[21:26] just find it so fascinating um well my
[21:29] parents actually surprised me in Prague
[21:31] as well um at the conference because it
[21:35] was my birthday and they showed up and
[21:38] my parents are they just different I
[21:41] don't know they are so open to
[21:43] everything and they said do it do it um
[21:48] go for it uh look after yourself um and
[21:53] just do what makes you happy uh because
[21:56] I mean I
[21:58] I want to have children at one point in
[22:00] my life and I want to put them in a
[22:03] world where I see a future you know so
[22:07] and this is why I believe in Bitcoin and
[22:10] also in nosta to build something and
[22:14] find a solution and they my parents are
[22:17] super supportive I mean my friends they
[22:20] are like yeah that's another crazy idea
[22:22] what I do or what I have so but they are
[22:26] in their normal day-to-day business and
[22:28] life
[22:29] and but that's absolutely fine you know
[22:32] so what what do you think or why do you
[22:34] think most people have such hesitation
[22:38] to go into Bitcoin they look at as you
[22:40] said before they look at that it's
[22:42] gambling yeah you can do you can play
[22:44] with your your Bitcoin I think even
[22:46] Trump said that go play with your
[22:48] Bitcoin um why do most people have like
[22:51] this this hesitation against Bitcoin the
[22:54] feud is gambling the feud is something
[22:56] risky and how can we maybe make it
[23:00] better so people can actually crash
[23:02] Bitcoin faster I believe that a lot of
[23:05] people just don't know like my neighbor
[23:08] the other day she never heard of the
[23:10] word Bitcoin and she's 35 years old like
[23:13] even never heard of the word Bitcoin and
[23:17] I was like okay I mean they are like and
[23:21] that was like very interesting for me
[23:24] and I mean
[23:26] I am in in Bitcoin because people I
[23:32] trust orange pilled me like literally
[23:37] people I really really trust and know
[23:40] very well and for a long time
[23:43] um but I think that's that's the thing
[23:47] like you you just need people around you
[23:50] you who are explaining it to you and and
[23:53] also like women so like I'm a woman and
[23:57] I hesitate like like when I was like
[24:00] going to to Ria I went there by myself
[24:03] and I was like
[24:04] o this is this is very challenging so I
[24:08] mean of course I know I knew that a few
[24:10] people from Prague were there but I've
[24:12] seen them just once like once in my life
[24:15] um but I came there and it was just so
[24:20] so amazing because like you have these
[24:22] groups you have these telegram groups
[24:25] and then you have um then you just like
[24:28] message each other I was like yeah let's
[24:30] go for dinner I was like oh my God this
[24:32] would never happen like in my normal
[24:34] life because and everybody was like why
[24:38] why why are you doing this like can you
[24:40] trust these people it's like yeah I can
[24:43] trust these people because the spirit is
[24:45] just different I don't know if you if
[24:48] you realize or that as well
[24:50] so I I love that a lot I mean um in
[24:54] Braga something really interesting
[24:56] happened because um I have done a of
[24:58] podcasts before so I met a lot of people
[25:00] that either watch and listen to the
[25:02] podcast or as are guests on the podcast
[25:04] for the first time ever in real life so
[25:06] it was like I met like old friends again
[25:11] it felt like that even though I like I
[25:13] just knew them from the internet and now
[25:16] like I get there and like all of the
[25:18] sudden like 20 people there that I know
[25:20] that I never met in in in person before
[25:23] like it was it was an amazing feeling uh
[25:25] but that that's that's comes mostly from
[25:28] from the podcast so I I'm I'm kind of
[25:31] biased and not coming from a normal
[25:34] person that doesn't know anyone because
[25:35] I knew a lot of people so for me it's a
[25:37] little bit harder but one year before
[25:40] that I was also in brag and there I had
[25:42] exact that feeling because nobody knew
[25:44] me I had no podcast I was not known at
[25:46] at all I had no social presence uh so I
[25:49] was just going there and it was amazing
[25:51] you you just make friends while you go
[25:54] to a booth and then someone stands there
[25:56] yeah he thinks like you like he he has
[25:59] the same belief that than you to to a
[26:01] certain extent and you you you it's
[26:04] really a community and and really a nice
[26:07] friendship that you that you can share
[26:10] really quickly in the spirit is as you
[26:12] said like oh yeah let's let's grab
[26:13] something uh for for food let's do
[26:16] something for dinners like that's that's
[26:17] such an open and interesting um
[26:21] Community it's it's it's fascinating to
[26:23] see I think a lot of that comes down
[26:25] because we're so early I I don't know if
[26:28] if Bitcoin makes this with us probably
[26:31] more like because we in such an early
[26:33] group uh or do you think that um maybe
[26:36] even Bitcoin changes us as human beings
[26:38] to a certain
[26:40] extent um I I think so I think we are
[26:43] more open to I mean I can just uh tell
[26:48] from my side I'm I was always a very
[26:51] open person like I mean the pandemic
[26:55] like especially told me to do to be to
[26:58] do so and I think you question like the
[27:01] system a lot of things what's happening
[27:03] in the world how you can solve and find
[27:06] a solution for a few topics and not just
[27:10] money related like freedom of speech um
[27:14] the
[27:15] ecosystem and this is what yeah is is
[27:20] such a different world like after the
[27:23] week in Ria I came back to Berlin I was
[27:26] depressed was really really sad it was
[27:29] really really difficult and now I'm so
[27:32] looking forward to go to Amsterdam and
[27:35] meet new people and go to South America
[27:38] and yeah that's just yeah that's really
[27:42] cool really cool I love it a lot um as
[27:46] you're also in in Nostra I'm really
[27:48] interested in Nostra as as also a
[27:50] content creator um do you think that
[27:52] Nostra could now be like what Bitcoin
[27:55] was in 2011 because Nostra is so early
[27:58] and like the network effects are slow
[27:59] and and all the things that Bitcoin was
[28:02] in 2011 do you see that that comparison
[28:05] yeah absolutely I spoke with a lot of
[28:07] people who've been like building on
[28:10] Noster like for two or three years um
[28:14] ago and I mean what I love about nosta I
[28:18] mean nostri it was like a conference
[28:20] with 350 people that was nothing um but
[28:24] you actually meet the developer so when
[28:27] there's not something working like I was
[28:30] like um writing something on highlighter
[28:33] um which um and I couldn't upload my
[28:36] post and something didn't work and I was
[28:38] like hey this doesn't work and you go
[28:41] directly to the uh to the developer and
[28:44] oh yeah um we gonna We we're fixing it
[28:47] so you can actually email the CEOs of
[28:51] all these um companies and um clients
[28:55] this is just brilliant this is so so
[28:57] cool and um you can also give them
[29:00] feedback and they appreciate that and I
[29:03] mean try to go to Instagram and send
[29:06] them like a quick uh WhatsApp it's not
[29:10] working good luck with that yeah it's
[29:13] it's it's fascinating yeah I had I had I
[29:16] think a a few weeks ago a discussion
[29:18] with with YouTube because they have a
[29:21] really weird Buck but it's not a bug I
[29:24] found out it's like intentional uh when
[29:26] you pay for you premium you can play
[29:30] videos in the in the background but only
[29:33] for videos that are public and not for
[29:35] members only so like it's a small weird
[29:37] thing but I learned that like it's it's
[29:39] it's hard to communicate with big
[29:41] companies but yeah if I mean of nostr is
[29:43] getting bigger I guess this this problem
[29:45] is also uh will will come closer um why
[29:50] do you think Nostra is so important for
[29:52] us freedom of speech I mean I've seen it
[29:56] personally and during during the
[29:58] pandemic like my um
[30:02] family um they
[30:06] doctors
[30:08] so and of course there was a time where
[30:12] we were
[30:13] questioning a few
[30:14] things and then you write stuff about
[30:19] that and um
[30:21] some social media um accounts or apps
[30:27] don't like
[30:29] that and they delete your
[30:31] stuff
[30:33] and I think that's quite brutal if a
[30:39] CEO of a
[30:41] company can just decide okay this post
[30:47] or tweak or whatever we're going to
[30:51] delete because it's uncomfortable for us
[30:54] and with
[30:55] nosta that is not happening and this is
[30:58] what I really really find so fascinating
[31:02] and if we would have had nosta like back
[31:06] in the days or if we like wow but I
[31:10] think there's a reason why uh we didn't
[31:12] have that and now we can just make it
[31:15] better and um it's very it's a very
[31:18] powerful thing to do and to have so and
[31:22] yeah so it it's just affecting me
[31:26] personally that's why I I love it so
[31:28] much I love that a lot really really
[31:30] cool is there as you were in nostri and
[31:34] in Bitcoin prag besides the size is
[31:37] there a difference between the the
[31:38] Nostra and the Bitcoin Community o good
[31:41] question the thing is like I personally
[31:44] didn't realize it that much because
[31:46] nostri was just before uh Baltic honey
[31:50] Batcher so a few people were just coming
[31:53] like before but why what I did realize
[31:57] that
[31:58] like a lot of
[32:00] bitcoiners don't have nosta like
[32:04] maybe one or 2% but vice versa like most
[32:10] of the um people on nosta they do have
[32:15] Bitcoin and I think that has to be
[32:18] changed and I mean we've seen it now in
[32:22] Brazil like they boun Twitter like what
[32:25] is happening and um so people just
[32:29] sharing their end pops it's like okay
[32:31] there we have an alternative um where we
[32:34] actually can speak where we actually can
[32:36] build something on it I think um that's
[32:39] why it's so important um to spread the
[32:42] world if you watch or listen to my
[32:44] podcast on a regular basis I guess you
[32:47] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[32:49] most important step is to keep their
[32:52] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[32:55] wallet my personal recommendation for
[32:57] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[32:59] secure it's simple to set up it's also

[33:58] last but not least I have something
[34:00] completely new for you guys I partnered
[34:03] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[34:07] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[34:10] saw created by anyone look at that
[34:12] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[34:15] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[34:18] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[34:21] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[34:24] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[34:27] make sure to check out the link in the
[34:29] description for this amazing coin
[34:31] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[34:34] amazing I love them so much it was
[34:36] really hard for me to pick the one that
[34:38] I want to have because there are a lot
[34:40] of great options I went with the new
[34:43] transparency Edition they're all limited
[34:46] so grab yours those will not be
[34:48] available for a long time but there will
[34:50] come new models and new amazing designs
[34:53] along the way yeah this this Twitter
[34:55] thing was interesting because um when IL
[34:58] musk decided not to censor things from
[35:01] Americans where a lot of mainstream
[35:03] media was like oh you have to censor
[35:05] this this hate speech and stuff like
[35:07] that and and IL mus got a lot of hate
[35:09] for not censoring uh people and then uh
[35:13] this in Brazil happened and the
[35:14] mainstream media in America was all of
[35:16] the sudden on El musk sides and saying
[35:19] like oh he's a freedom of speech fighter
[35:20] and it's it's good that he stands up
[35:22] against that Brazilian judge it's it's
[35:24] it's funny how how people like if if
[35:27] freedom of speech is your is is
[35:30] convenient for you they for freedom of
[35:33] speech but if it's something that they
[35:35] don't like it's not freedom of speech
[35:37] like that that's not freedom of speech
[35:39] freedom of speech is like you you can
[35:40] handle also s the speech that you don't
[35:43] like and that's why it's interesting for
[35:45] me it's also like even the like even if
[35:49] Nostra I think Nostra can be mainstream
[35:52] but even if Nostra never gets to a
[35:54] mainstream point it will um benefit
[35:57] benefit freedom of speech because I can
[35:59] guarantee you that that IL musk and
[36:02] other social media managers are aware of
[36:05] Nostra and they know if they ban too
[36:08] much if they do if they go too far with
[36:11] that limiting of speech people will
[36:14] leave people have that bad experiences
[36:17] not only those who are directly affected
[36:20] but those also who are indirectly
[36:21] affected if people have like a show that
[36:24] they watch on a daily basis and all of
[36:26] the sudden that show is not not there
[36:28] anymore they're like hm where's the show
[36:30] gone and they're like oh they got banned
[36:33] oh where where they are now oh they are
[36:35] now Rumble oh they're not Nostra I will
[36:37] I will watch them there so I think just
[36:39] the possibility that we can exit the
[36:42] system makes the system better so I
[36:44] think nostro makes X and all the other
[36:47] social media um things better uh and it
[36:50] will be very interesting how the future
[36:52] of social media is and hopefully maybe X
[36:55] and YouTube maybe integrate some point
[36:57] with with the Nostra protocol like
[36:59] that's possible uh and uh I I'm I'm very
[37:03] hopeful for freedom of speech to be
[37:05] honest uh long term uh and uh because
[37:09] like right now we are in the the first
[37:11] 10 20 years where we have this social
[37:13] media weird thing uh where everyone can
[37:16] say everything online and then now the
[37:18] traditional system is like oh that's
[37:20] that's dangerous that's dangerous but
[37:23] the more the time goes on the uh uh we
[37:25] will see like you cannot you cannot uh
[37:29] do anything against it anyways even if
[37:30] you really even if you're someone like
[37:32] oh I hate free speech and I want to
[37:34] exactly control what what speech is you
[37:36] cannot do that on the internet the
[37:37] internet is free people will develop
[37:40] things people will develop Nostra uh and
[37:43] if if uh YouTube bans too much they will
[37:45] all flee to the rumble they will all
[37:48] flee to the nost they will all flee to
[37:50] Fountain uh they will all flee to
[37:52] something else than uh YouTube so that's
[37:56] that's a huge positive development I
[37:58] just want sorry for the rambling I just
[38:00] wanted to no I like to like have the
[38:02] insights it's like it's so true I mean
[38:05] we all know social media is broken I
[38:08] mean there's a great documentary I don't
[38:10] know if you know um it from Max Dem
[38:13] Marco um he did that he published that a
[38:16] year ago and like social media is like
[38:20] addictive like I get depressions like
[38:24] like Instagram you have always these
[38:26] scrolling and E ement and here and there
[38:28] is like so so much I get anxiety from it
[38:31] I get sick from it and um this is what I
[38:36] think don't think like that they will
[38:39] integrate into nosta because um there is
[38:43] a CEO of Instagram and there's not a CEO
[38:46] of nosta there is just none and um nosta
[38:50] is built
[38:52] to I mean you can choose your own
[38:54] algorith algorithm on nosta and um that
[38:59] is impossible on X or or Instagram and I
[39:04] I have to say like the last two weeks
[39:07] something really really changed for me
[39:09] as well so like I'm less active on
[39:12] Instagram I don't post any every day
[39:15] like a story and people reaching out
[39:17] privately and was like are you okay I
[39:19] was like yeah I'm absolutely fine why
[39:22] yeah you're not like posting so much
[39:24] stuff I just want to see if you're okay
[39:27] and you don't like my stuff anymore I
[39:28] was like I was like you know what I'm so
[39:32] okay you can find me now on nosta this
[39:34] is how okay I am am and they was like
[39:36] nosta
[39:38] what and I just yeah I have no intention
[39:43] to
[39:43] just I mean get on my phone in the
[39:46] morning and open Instagram anymore I
[39:49] mean who would do that anyway like
[39:51] imagine that's like letting 100 people
[39:54] in your bedroom as as Jay Shetty is
[39:56] saying like who who would do
[39:58] that I love that I saw that clip also
[40:00] from J shete like if you're open social
[40:03] media in the morning it's like letting
[40:04] 100 people in your bedroom I love that a
[40:06] lot does some of your friends maybe
[40:08] think that you join the cult yeah sure
[40:12] it's it's fascinating it's like from the
[40:14] outside it could actually look like that
[40:16] you're socially um like you're thinking
[40:20] different you're asking questions you
[40:21] didn't ask before you're changing some
[40:23] of your behavior uh you even out of that
[40:27] you maybe even start having new friends
[40:31] uh you are socially somewhere else and
[40:33] dist distancing maybe so like I get that
[40:37] why people maybe think that Bitcoin is a
[40:39] cult because from from the all the um
[40:41] properties and all the um if you just
[40:44] look from an objective standpoint and
[40:46] the person how it does um it it's either
[40:49] he po positively changes something or he
[40:52] joined a cult and people tend towards
[40:55] hey he joined a cult right
[40:58] I mean yeah in in in Germany you call
[41:02] them different thinkers I don't know
[41:05] like you know and that I always
[41:10] questioned the system since the pandemic
[41:13] I always were
[41:15] asking why
[41:18] and people and my friend know that from
[41:21] me and I was like like all the
[41:24] vaccination rules you had here in
[41:27] Germany I was like nope not doing
[41:32] it and you get a lot of hate for that
[41:35] you get a lot of hate you get in so much
[41:39] trouble I mean on a German podcast I
[41:42] would never like talk about these kind
[41:44] of
[41:46] things because they probably knock at my
[41:48] door at one point like who is this
[41:52] woman and who are you and yeah I got in
[41:56] a lot of trouble for or like not uh
[42:00] supporting the overall
[42:04] opinion yeah it's interesting I think
[42:06] you're talking about quer and it's I
[42:08] think directly translated lateral
[42:11] fingers but I think uh most um the best
[42:16] uh translation is probably out of the
[42:18] box thinking uh I think that's the best
[42:22] at least that I could think of uh of a
[42:26] translation and I think that's something
[42:29] really interesting that that word has a
[42:33] negative uh connotation to it in the
[42:36] German area where like out of the box
[42:38] thinking is the best thinking there is
[42:42] because everything else can be done with
[42:44] AI and machine learning exactly no I
[42:47] totally agree and this is what I try to
[42:50] um yeah out of the box that's why I was
[42:52] looking for a different word because for
[42:54] me out of the box is something super
[42:56] positive
[42:57] and this is all what we want getting out
[43:00] of your comfort zone like or at the edge
[43:02] like you know thinking out of um the box
[43:05] but here it's
[43:08] like no don't just don't the the German
[43:13] thinking stay in the line has be perfect
[43:15] line exactly I can say that because I'm
[43:19] German this is
[43:21] okay no but it's um yeah and so is my
[43:27] whole family but yeah of course not
[43:30] especially me we are we are still young
[43:32] and um people in my age of course they
[43:37] do think out of the
[43:38] box but they don't act like that you
[43:42] know so they think oh yeah this
[43:44] shouldn't be the case this is not good
[43:47] but I do it anyway because like 90% from
[43:49] the people are always doing also doing
[43:52] this and um if I don't do this uh oh
[43:56] yeah then ah I get in trouble I was like
[44:00] okay how did Bitcoin already as you have
[44:04] it only short time uh how did Bitcoin
[44:07] already impact your personal freedom
[44:10] like it was 2020 when I first heard
[44:14] about Bitcoin friend of mine who
[44:17] actually then orange pilled me um spoke
[44:21] about it I was like what is that and
[44:24] then he was like also
[44:27] like it was during the pandemic he was
[44:29] like yeah this is not good here have the
[44:31] research was like oh my God this
[44:34] community things like so I connected
[44:37] Bitcoin with a out of the box thinker so
[44:41] the whole Community behind and this is
[44:44] what gave me so much support and hope so
[44:49] I I joined this telegram group back in
[44:52] the days and there were so like-minded
[44:55] people and I showed it to my parents
[44:57] parents like Mom Dad we are not alone
[44:59] here in Germany there are also other
[45:01] people who think like us and who try to
[45:05] find a solution and yeah that is what
[45:09] just got me more into Bitcoin and then I
[45:11] started of course reading about Bitcoin
[45:15] but I was just like nah this is so early
[45:19] let's wait let's wait so it took me
[45:21] three more years until to was like okay
[45:24] you should do something now yeah it's a
[45:27] it's three years seems a good time I
[45:29] also needed three years I needed from
[45:32] 2017 to 2020 I fought three years long
[45:35] that Bitcoin is a scam I think it's just
[45:37] normal like you you it's it's too good
[45:40] to be true in the beginning you're like
[45:42] I'm That Kind of be like that's not the
[45:45] case yeah exactly but I mean it proved
[45:48] themself right so I think everybody a
[45:51] lot of people also against it and say
[45:54] it's gambling because they're afraid of
[45:56] it maybe I absolutely yeah I have one
[45:59] more question about Nostra um what
[46:02] hurdles do you think Nostra has to to
[46:05] overcome to really on board a lot of
[46:08] people and have those Network effects
[46:10] that the big social media already have
[46:13] yeah that's a good topic actually the
[46:16] onboarding process is is still tricky
[46:20] I'm not going to going to lie
[46:22] [Music]
[46:23] um I well somebody set it up for me at
[46:28] at the booth at BTC PR so downloaded the
[46:31] app connected my wallet and then you
[46:34] have your I mean it's quite easy you
[46:36] don't have your username you have your
[46:40] um public key and you don't have your
[46:42] password you have your um private
[46:45] key but save that private key somewhere
[46:49] because otherwise you cannot like if
[46:53] this is gone it's gone so and this is
[46:57] something like you need so many apps in
[47:00] order to actually use it and if I
[47:03] wouldn't have had so many people who
[47:06] were so patient to me explaining it
[47:08] showing it um like if I like if I say to
[47:12] my mom for example yeah go go to Noster
[47:16] set that up download this app and then
[47:18] this and this and this I lost her
[47:20] already it's like so that's why I think
[47:24] um workshops would be amazing I mean
[47:26] there
[47:27] amazing YouTube tutorials already like
[47:30] um Derek Ross at nor Trier had an
[47:34] amazing speech like uh Noster for
[47:36] beginners or so um that was really not
[47:40] so tacky it w like but that's the
[47:43] problem with German people I know that a
[47:46] lot of people they do not speak German
[47:48] uh English that well so we need German
[47:52] content at least here and I think the
[47:54] same applies to like South America
[47:58] I mean when I was in Brazil back
[48:00] 2019 none of them spoke English like
[48:03] ditally people at my age they don't but
[48:05] I mean these days with AI could be
[48:08] translated quite easily um but yeah the
[48:12] onboarding is not so it's not so easy I
[48:15] have to say the onboarding has to be
[48:18] extremely good like I think that that's
[48:20] a like the a major bottleneck because I
[48:24] see the even onboarding
[48:27] uh like your grandma to Whatsapp is a
[48:30] like oh I have what I have to download
[48:31] that app like even the downloading of
[48:33] the app is some is already too much so
[48:35] like then with NPS and if you if you use
[48:39] two words that they don't understand
[48:41] they will not do it they the the the
[48:43] friction is just too high so it has to
[48:46] be really like you download the app you
[48:48] have fre clicks and all of the sudden
[48:49] you can already post a note you can
[48:52] already do something so it has to be
[48:54] extremely good and I'm I'm very positive
[48:57] that we will get to the point I see that
[48:59] we are not there even close yet like you
[49:03] have to really want an Nostra account
[49:05] you really want to be on the platform um
[49:09] and that what reason is there to be on
[49:11] the platform yeah freedom of speech most
[49:14] people uh in social media don't care
[49:17] about that too much right now
[49:19] unfortunately it's a small bubble that
[49:21] really is like oh freedom of speech most
[49:23] just scroll through their Instagram and
[49:25] Tik toks and YouTube shorts they're like
[49:28] ah I see content people don't uh ban
[49:31] anything so I thought this gets really
[49:35] out of hand where a lot of people notice
[49:37] the the freedom of speech aspect or it
[49:41] gets really good in onboarding people
[49:43] and then starts like for for nost to
[49:46] succeed we we still need a a long way to
[49:49] go but the same thing applied to Bitcoin
[49:51] in the early days like same same things
[49:54] we we said about Bitcoin uh when we
[49:57] didn't had all those apps helping and
[49:59] exchanges helping um interesting will be
[50:02] because with Bitcoin there has a major
[50:05] Financial incentive like you you if you
[50:09] adopt Bitcoin you in you you're really
[50:12] incentivized financially with
[50:15] Nostra I I don't see the financial
[50:17] incentive I mean of course if you post
[50:19] there you get saps and those sabs are
[50:22] Bitcoin and then you you your value is
[50:25] also like there there are a lot of
[50:27] challenges that I still see but I love
[50:31] the technology and I hope it is
[50:33] mainstream one day uh and I'm trying my
[50:37] best to like bring the topic up in the
[50:39] podcast and talk about it uh and use it
[50:42] also from time to time but as a content
[50:44] creator you cannot be on every platform
[50:47] and right now ax and YouTube and the
[50:50] little bit Rumble is where the the
[50:52] action is and uh it's a it's an
[50:54] interesting it's an interesting time
[50:56] where we are right now it's like the the
[50:58] first inning of of
[51:00] Nostra yeah it is very interesting but
[51:03] like I mean what I realized is like you
[51:08] post I was I was writing a post the
[51:11] other day and it was literally the
[51:14] moment I thought oh my God now it it
[51:18] clicked so like I'm on Primal and then I
[51:21] was like putting in my private key on
[51:27] highlighter and then everything was
[51:28] there I was like what like I do not have
[51:32] to set up a new profile a new picture
[51:36] like this is not happening with LinkedIn
[51:38] or Instagram or Twitter you have to like
[51:41] oh my gosh and I was like writing my
[51:44] inner experience and excitement just in
[51:47] a very short post on um on Primal and
[51:52] the people were
[51:53] like sending me sets and like even Jack
[51:57] dorsy like sent me 5,000 Z was like okay
[52:01] I wrote something and I earned something
[52:05] uh do that on Instagram good luck like
[52:07] you know it's like same with podcasts on
[52:09] Fountain like um if I like your like
[52:12] your episode I sent you some I I zap you
[52:16] right so and this is just absolutely
[52:20] amazing and people are also like super
[52:23] super friendly like I like I wish them
[52:26] good morning like do that on Instagram
[52:29] say good morning people like what is
[52:32] this woman talking like nobody's
[52:34] replying and yeah that's the spirit and
[52:40] that's what I just
[52:41] love is there another place there where
[52:44] I should be I mean I'm on Fountain I get
[52:46] saps there is there another thing where
[52:48] I should upload even maybe my video uh
[52:52] on Nostra I I heard one one guy said to
[52:54] me I should upload the link of YouTube
[52:56] but I'm like yeah that that's not that
[52:58] does doesn't do it is is there something
[53:00] where I can natively upload the video
[53:02] and it's like a similar platform than
[53:05] than um uh than YouTube or Rumble I mean
[53:10] I'm a huge fan of like Primal even you
[53:13] cannot like upload the well you can
[53:17] that's what what I yeah I did that like
[53:19] a week ago I mean probably you download
[53:21] your video and have a short like like
[53:24] clip or so and then you can direct ly
[53:26] upload it on Primal as well and say this
[53:29] was the interview you have the clip and
[53:31] then you send the link and it's like now
[53:33] available on Fountain to to listen to um
[53:36] absolutely Primal is more like it from
[53:38] the UI it feels more like Twitter right
[53:41] PE I use it as well to post their like
[53:44] pictures or videos and so does
[53:47] others so it's what that's the beauty of
[53:52] it you just do whatever feels right for
[53:55] you and if if you would like to send a
[53:57] short like upload a short video um to
[54:01] tease your um
[54:03] podcast why not then people click on it
[54:07] oh yeah short videos yeah like short
[54:10] vide like 30 seconds like oh my God this
[54:13] is cool so this is how we how I did it
[54:16] with philli like a week ago from Bitcoin
[54:18] insights he
[54:20] just um yeah uploaded it and that was
[54:25] that was quite fun really cool yeah
[54:28] thank you so much probably I will I will
[54:30] start doing that uh because I thought
[54:32] about how I can get on nost I mean of
[54:34] the fountain I'm already kind of Nostra
[54:37] thing they have a Nostra integration and
[54:39] stuff like that um but the platforms
[54:42] feel more than feels more like Twitter
[54:45] and less than YouTube or Rumble from
[54:47] like the just from overview like YouTube
[54:49] is like oh you have a desktop app also
[54:51] and you see all the things it's a little
[54:53] bit of different UI just but uh for
[54:55] example also upload my full video on
[54:58] Twitter but I know from the statistics
[55:02] people don't watch it people see the
[55:04] video and then go to YouTube yeah yeah
[55:07] yeah short clips and tease it and um ask
[55:10] for feedback they are honest they like
[55:14] that's what I would suggest ah really
[55:16] cool thank you so much uh perfect then
[55:18] uh we have a lot of topics left but
[55:21] already are on one hour um maybe what we
[55:25] could go into um one thing that I really
[55:27] want to get into maybe second thing if
[55:30] you have time what would the world look
[55:33] like if Nostra and Bitcoin are
[55:36] successful whenever this is maybe 2050
[55:38] maybe uh 20 21 so like what do you think
[55:42] will will be different in the world if
[55:45] uh we have everyone is exchanging money
[55:48] with Bitcoin and everyone is has the
[55:51] social connections on on Nostra I sorry
[55:54] to say that I don't think that's going
[55:56] to happen
[56:00] ever because there are always like some
[56:02] egos around who would like to be the CEO
[56:05] of these
[56:06] companies like you know somebody would
[56:09] like to be the CEO of Bitcoin and nosta
[56:12] which is impossible because it's like
[56:14] decentralized and uh not going to happen
[56:18] um but like for me is I I do care about
[56:23] the current system but I cannot fight
[56:26] against it is absolutely pointless
[56:29] so
[56:31] um I we just build our own system and
[56:35] once that like falls apart we have our
[56:39] other community our support to have a
[56:42] like um way to live in hopefully more
[56:46] freedom and more peace I mean we will
[56:49] not change the world but I think if we
[56:54] can just like take the
[56:57] people we care about and um build
[57:02] something for our children in the future
[57:05] to have a better place to live that
[57:08] would be fantastic cool I think I think
[57:10] that could be really cool world if if we
[57:13] get there but yeah I agree with you it's
[57:17] it's especially in 2050 right so it's
[57:20] like yeah sure that's
[57:23] tomorrow I mean the one thing that makes
[57:25] me more more optimistic is when I see
[57:28] past technology
[57:30] advancements like when you look back at
[57:32] for example when in in in 2020 what what
[57:36] was the internet looking like and how
[57:38] many people actually use the internet on
[57:40] a daily basis and how many do it now so
[57:44] we we could go through a a quick
[57:48] adoption and there there's then this
[57:50] topic of like oh but now we have fear
[57:53] and we have a big system that fights
[57:55] against that but there was always like a
[57:57] big system that fought against a new one
[57:59] like but probably fat is way way
[58:02] stronger than that it's interesting um I
[58:05] I I I'm currently I'm writing on on a
[58:07] book and I'm writing on articles on how
[58:09] this transition goes and and if we ever
[58:12] get there uh so I'm I'm not 100% at the
[58:15] at my answer yet but I see a lot of
[58:17] positive and a lot of negative things
[58:19] going in this transitioning time and I I
[58:22] choose to be very hopeful that we can
[58:24] live one day in a Bitcoin World um with
[58:27] Noster I'm just not deep enough uh to to
[58:30] to think about that uh but if if open
[58:34] Protocols are long-term better than
[58:36] closed ones then Bitcoin and Nostra
[58:39] hopefully win long term and will be
[58:42] interesting to see because yeah if if
[58:44] with with social media there's then a
[58:46] whole other um challenges also that that
[58:50] Bitcoin has so will be very interesting
[58:53] so I was just curious what what you
[58:54] think about that um yeah it's it's
[58:56] interest it's a lot of interesting uh
[58:59] thoughts I mean yeah it's like for me
[59:02] it's it's just hope like you know this
[59:04] is why so excited about it this is why
[59:07] try to do something for the community
[59:10] and it's like when you're new into
[59:13] something it's like that's for me the
[59:15] biggest challenge right now proof of
[59:16] work because I'm new here and I'm who am
[59:20] I to say something right so um that's
[59:23] why I will like no I do not have um one
[59:28] uh proper person I work for I volunteer
[59:32] I like spend like like I'm happy to just
[59:35] like buy my tickets to these kind of
[59:37] things because um you give you get so
[59:41] much back from that that's this just
[59:45] amazing I mean the amount of money we
[59:47] spend on our daily basis like going to a
[59:49] party on a club it's like yeah that's a
[59:51] ticket for me to Amsterdam kind of you
[59:54] know so
[59:56] uh very very true last topic that uh we
[59:59] discussed before that we we want to get
[60:01] in the podcast is women and Bitcoin and
[60:03] it's interesting for me because I see
[60:05] all the statistics how many females
[60:07] versus males uh audience I have and it's
[60:10] it's it it's somewhere between five and
[60:12] 10% some it's closer to 9% some it's
[60:14] closer to 5% it's it's not a trend it's
[60:17] like up and down for me and I also
[60:19] mentioned that I think with Ana's um
[60:22] podcast that the biggest um female
[60:25] podcast is natal prunell she has around
[60:27] 20% of of female audience uh which is
[60:31] like okay if a female uh podcast host
[60:34] and she's the biggest one that's
[60:35] probably like right now the current uh
[60:39] maximum I could reach the 20% so I'm
[60:42] around like halfway there um how do you
[60:44] see that like do do you think it's it's
[60:46] it's harder to to Orange Peel uh woman
[60:49] or is it just different or we don't have
[60:51] enough uh woman role models in in in the
[60:53] Bitcoin speaker world just can like
[60:56] tell from my experience if like for
[60:58] example Ana wouldn't like have told me
[61:03] like yeah speak speak to Robin go on
[61:05] that podcast I was like why would I do
[61:08] that and she was like T you have an
[61:10] amazing story to tell um I was like and
[61:13] I was like I'm not the developer I'm new
[61:15] to this I have no idea I mean I have no
[61:18] clue what I'm talking about and she said
[61:20] well yes you do and you can give so much
[61:25] back and Inspire maybe other like women
[61:29] or other people to to just like yeah get
[61:33] on board it as well even if you do not
[61:36] have a tech related background and this
[61:40] is what I try to explain all my um
[61:44] female friends like don't be afraid and
[61:47] if you have questions they're amazing
[61:48] people you can ask so and this is what
[61:51] I'm doing it's like I don't have the
[61:54] knowledge so I just ask is like okay
[61:57] what can we do and but you have to be a
[61:59] very open person in order to do so
[62:01] because yes there are a lot of males and
[62:04] of course um at these
[62:08] conferences that can be sometimes quite
[62:10] intimidating but these kind of men
[62:14] they're super nice they're literally
[62:17] very very nice and helpful
[62:21] and I mean I work in events for few
[62:25] years now
[62:26] never seen that in any industry that
[62:29] there was such a openness and
[62:32] understanding um thing so yeah I would
[62:37] love to see that like it's it's
[62:38] interesting to to to to speak about that
[62:41] uh and yeah it's it's interesting
[62:44] because I for me it's like how how
[62:47] different are are the people in Bitcoin
[62:49] versus somewhere else I have a little
[62:51] bit experience in it security and I can
[62:53] definitely say there's a big difference
[62:55] between it Security in Bitcoin but it's
[62:58] it's like it's just twoo different like
[62:59] I cannot really say something about that
[63:01] really cool thank you so much for
[63:03] sharing this with us um before we get to
[63:05] to the endro te uh what can we learn
[63:08] from you besides all the things that we
[63:10] already talked about I think what I
[63:12] actually realized sometimes this like
[63:15] the Bitcoin community and also the nosta
[63:18] community is very unique you have to be
[63:20] very sensible what you do what you say
[63:24] but they are super super nice and
[63:25] friendly but um I just yeah like have
[63:31] to actually do the work rather than just
[63:35] like stop talking and just like do
[63:37] something you know and a proof of work
[63:40] um is very important uh for the
[63:42] community and this is the big learnings
[63:46] I had from the last couple of weeks
[63:48] actually you can be excited and
[63:50] passionate about something and talk
[63:51] about like oh how excited and passionate
[63:53] you about about it but just like um go
[63:57] out there change something and do
[64:00] something I love it really cool now
[64:02] let's come to the endro team where our
[64:04] previous guest asked a question for our
[64:06] next guest so the question for you is if
[64:09] you can change one thing about Bitcoin
[64:12] what would it be I don't like
[64:14] orange I love that
[64:17] answer orange uh what color would you
[64:22] prefer like what what's what what should
[64:23] be the the color of of Bitcoin um purple
[64:27] no yeah that's what I wanted to say
[64:29] purple but that's like that's Noster so
[64:32] but you can't change anything about
[64:33] Bitcoin because like that's how it is so
[64:37] I mean you can just like there's no
[64:39] Central Authority on color and maybe you
[64:41] can just you you can just use another
[64:44] color for Bitcoin and if you use it good
[64:47] enough and people really like that color
[64:49] on bitcoin maybe it gets adopted and
[64:51] maybe you are the person that changes
[64:53] the color of Bitcoin from like gold to
[64:55] uh orange to now I don't know
[64:58] Green no green is not good green is not
[65:00] good Bitcoin cash is green sorry okay
