[00:00] it's going to happen a lot quicker than
[00:01] we think because I think a lot of
[00:03] countries are starting to pay attention
[00:04] but I think they're keeping it quiet if
[00:06] people aren't correctly informed how are
[00:08] they going to make the right decisions
[00:10] Bitcoin shines a light on everything
[00:11] that's broken it's a global
[00:14] decentralized neutral peer-to-peer cash
[00:17] how can that not change the world we're
[00:19] being controlled by algorithms and we
[00:21] don't even know if what we're thinking
[00:23] is real or what we believe is true we're
[00:26] getting to this point where governments
[00:28] are able to censor more and more under
[00:30] the guise of protecting children so
[00:33] they're saying that children are being
[00:35] harmed because of the content that
[00:37] they're seeing yet we're normalizing
[00:39] giving iPads to 2-year-olds I had my old
[00:41] boss was from Jamaica and when I was
[00:43] speaking to her about it I was oh my
[00:45] goodness go you guys are really far
[00:46] ahead when it comes to cbdcs and she
[00:48] just went oh what the Jamaican Bitcoin
[00:50] and I'm like don't you call it that mm-
[00:52] it is not the Jamaican Bitcoin it's
[00:54] completely different and once I
[00:56] explained it to her she was horrified
[00:58] just go with Bitcoin look at bit Bitcoin
[01:00] because like you can't understand what a
[01:02] good cbdc is going to look like until
[01:04] you understand Bitcoin and if you
[01:06] understand Bitcoin you wouldn't be
[01:07] working on the project once the price
[01:09] pumps to a level that they can't ignore
[01:12] it Global adoption is ramping up it's
[01:16] quicker than the internet adoption melee
[01:18] just wants the freedom to transact which
[01:21] seems like the most sensible way to
[01:24] [Music]
[01:27] go every Bitcoin transaction used is a
[01:30] swimming pool's worth of water oh man
[01:32] that that was that that was that was uh
[01:34] something and you're fighting against
[01:36] that article basically to be retracted
[01:39] because it's just completely false and
[01:43] completely wrong uh can you take us like
[01:45] first of like what the article said and
[01:48] what's wrong about it and then we can
[01:50] get into bit a little bit of how we can
[01:53] fight Bitcoin narratives and all that uh
[01:55] interesting stuff yeah so this is this
[01:58] is my favorite subject at the moment so
[02:00] thank you very much for allowing me to
[02:01] talk about it um the the article said
[02:06] and used the word payment and
[02:08] transaction interchangeably and that
[02:10] actually changes the outcome of how much
[02:13] water if any uh Bitcoin mining would use
[02:16] by a factor of a th000 x so a lot of
[02:19] Bitcoin mining doesn't even use water
[02:22] they can use Clos loot systems or if
[02:24] they're in immersion you know there's
[02:27] not a lot of loss and there's so much
[02:28] nuance involved in in a in a sentence
[02:31] like that that you can't just write it
[02:33] in a in a brief article where you use
[02:36] these words interchangeably because the
[02:38] outcome is completely different so when
[02:41] when I read this article I saw that the
[02:44] source was a Dutch Central Banker called
[02:46] Alex De and the conflict of interest
[02:50] between him being the source and a Dutch
[02:53] Central Banker hadn't been disclosed
[02:56] either well considering Bitcoin can
[02:58] completely disseminate central banks I
[03:01] think that that's noteworthy so I
[03:05] approached the BBC asked um put in a fre
[03:08] of information request to ask how they
[03:10] had fact checked the document because I
[03:12] knew that debris had been debunked in
[03:15] 2018 yet somehow he still is being
[03:19] treated as a credible source which is
[03:22] why I think that they didn't fact check
[03:24] it so I went back and I asked them how
[03:28] they fact checked and and they denied my
[03:30] freedom of information request saying
[03:32] that it was protected under journalism
[03:34] and art I thought that was really
[03:35] shocking because that means that you're
[03:37] never able to go to the BBC and quiz
[03:39] them or ask them for any information on
[03:41] journalism which is crazy considering
[03:43] the r news organization if that was Sky
[03:46] News it wouldn't have I wouldn't have
[03:48] had the same response and I've found out
[03:50] since that it's because of the way that
[03:51] it's funded that they're allowed to have
[03:53] that Clause so the they can just deny um
[03:57] what how they came to a story
[04:00] um because BBC is a government funded I
[04:03] guess well it's funded by licens fee
[04:08] payers so me I pay £15 a month and I
[04:11] have no choice but to pay it if you want
[04:13] to cancel your TV license you have to
[04:17] make a declaration to say that you don't
[04:19] watch any TV at all even if you don't
[04:22] watch the BBC even if you don't listen
[04:24] to the radio radio use none of their
[04:26] services you're still obliged to pay for
[04:29] it
[04:30] isn't so but you have the choice to
[04:33] completely because I'm asking in Austria
[04:36] uh this Choice was taken away uh this
[04:39] year actually or was it last year like
[04:41] this year last year was the choice
[04:42] taking away that you cannot even opt out
[04:45] of the tation license that you pay uh
[04:48] each month like a year ago it was still
[04:50] available that you're just like ah I
[04:52] don't watch any TV I don't even have a
[04:54] television in my house that is capable
[04:56] of watching TV that was enough if if
[04:59] there no television in your in your room
[05:02] then it's okay you don't have to pay it
[05:04] but now every house has to pay no matter
[05:08] if they watch it or not are able to
[05:10] watch it so in the UK you're still able
[05:13] to technically opt out of that system so
[05:17] yeah so it's not as bad as austrialia I
[05:19] thought it I thought it was terrible
[05:21] that that you couldn't opt out of
[05:23] something that you didn't use especially
[05:25] when you think it's £15 a month and you
[05:27] think Netflix is about eight Now TV is
[05:30] in you know it's just not value for
[05:33] money a and there's no
[05:35] accountability because I've been trying
[05:37] to get a retraction on that article for
[05:39] 10 months and I've been sent around in
[05:42] Bure bureaucratic circles so that
[05:44] they're not even being held accountable
[05:46] or you can't hold them
[05:48] accountable okay so uh that that that's
[05:51] that's fascinating that they can just
[05:53] like say especially if it's uh from
[05:56] taxpayers money like if it's a private
[05:58] institution I'm like okay maybe it's
[06:01] it's it's okay because uh they can say
[06:04] we have those sources or it's like it's
[06:07] a maybe even even freedom of speech like
[06:10] is is there something that's an
[06:11] interesting um uh can can you just say
[06:14] anything would you say that if you're
[06:16] are a news that is completely privately
[06:18] sourced it's like maybe even like my
[06:20] podcast um is is there something like
[06:22] that well when I write for Forbes I have
[06:26] to back up everything that I say
[06:28] everything that I right has to be
[06:31] provable and if I make a mistake or even
[06:35] say something where it needs to be made
[06:38] clearer even if it's just fine detail I
[06:41] make a correction or I make sure that it
[06:44] is corrected in some way so it's 100%
[06:47] factually accurate and my editor will
[06:49] make sure that I do that and this can be
[06:51] something for just very very minor so
[06:56] the BBC had been writing Bitcoin
[06:58] articles since
[07:00] 2013 and most of them have been
[07:03] Negative they haven't been factually
[07:06] accurate and nobody's been able to hold
[07:08] them accountable on that at all I don't
[07:12] understand how they're I just don't know
[07:13] how they're getting away with it and
[07:15] when you look into the journalists that
[07:17] are writing these articles they have
[07:19] absolutely zero background on finance or
[07:22] Tech or anything relevant to bitcoin at
[07:25] all yet they're given these assignments
[07:27] I don't understand I think the first
[07:29] time I saw you was actually on a
[07:32] television interview about cbdcs is is
[07:35] that right oh yeah you saw that yeah
[07:37] that was a little while ago yes yes I I
[07:40] think that went really wild on on X
[07:42] maybe I even reposted it because that
[07:44] was like oh it's on on on a normal TV
[07:47] they they're talking about cbdcs and
[07:49] it's not positive it's like against
[07:52] cbdcs that was uh something that shine
[07:55] out for me that is really so you're
[07:57] fighting really the the bitco narrative
[08:00] or on the mainstream media side I'm
[08:03] trying to because I can see that a lot
[08:06] if not all of the information that
[08:07] they're putting out there is wrong and
[08:09] it's harmful to people if people aren't
[08:12] correctly informed how are they going to
[08:13] make the right
[08:15] decisions and I think we underestimate
[08:18] how many people actually just rely on on
[08:21] those new sources they they only have
[08:24] the the BBC only have mainstream media
[08:26] and articles around that uh they don't
[08:28] go ahead and and make the research
[08:30] themselves and dig deep in like 20
[08:33] different podcasts that have 500
[08:35] different experts on them uh that's like
[08:39] the exception that's like the a small
[08:42] group of people that actually do that uh
[08:44] and most people are just like reading
[08:46] one article and then there's like this
[08:48] one or two negative things about Bitcoin
[08:51] it's boiling the ocean and it uses one
[08:54] transactions use as much as much energy
[08:56] as a swimming pool or something like
[08:57] that so and and this St stuck in the
[08:59] head and I think it's really important
[09:01] that we fight on a on every level uh on
[09:05] social media but also on mainstream
[09:07] media on on this traditional news
[09:09] sources uh those narratives and I think
[09:11] it's it's uh it's it's great that you're
[09:13] you're doing that um what why did it
[09:16] come to that like how how did you come
[09:17] to that fighting those Bitcoin
[09:20] narratives I think it started off just
[09:23] by taking an interest in Bitcoin and
[09:26] once it grabs you you probably know this
[09:29] you just become completely obsessed and
[09:32] you can't read nothing else is
[09:34] interesting anymore it's only about that
[09:36] and when you understand that there are
[09:37] so many different angles to it so
[09:39] there's the business angle human rights
[09:41] angle the technology angle there's um
[09:44] the environmental angle the Bitcoin
[09:46] mining angle there's one subject is huge
[09:50] and you can go off and look into the the
[09:53] subject that that appeals to you the
[09:55] most and once you start unlearning all
[09:59] the things that you thought to be true
[10:01] Bitcoin shines a light on everything
[10:03] that's broken and so once you see it you
[10:07] can't unsee it and it just becomes an
[10:09] obsession because all of a sudden you
[10:11] see that there are thing we we do have
[10:13] an option we do have a life R we can fix
[10:17] this if people understood it correctly
[10:21] and so once I knew that people were
[10:24] being misinformed and misled and I
[10:27] started reading all the bad Bitcoin
[10:30] articles it just became the only
[10:35] important thing that I could possibly do
[10:37] because I've got two children and I feel
[10:41] incredibly guilty when I look at them
[10:43] because of the world that they're going
[10:44] to inherit so I think that if I can just
[10:48] focus my time on making the
[10:51] world a little less I think that's
[10:55] all that's all I can really hope for I
[10:57] don't I don't I don't expect the moon on
[10:58] a I don't I don't think it's going to be
[11:01] brilliant I just think that maybe if I
[11:03] can just help a few people to understand
[11:06] its potential and then they can go off
[11:08] and help other people to understand its
[11:10] potential then that will be a good
[11:12] narrative that spreads rather than a bad
[11:13] one do you think that right now it's uh
[11:17] it's it's better or worse uh when we
[11:19] talk about narratives and and and uh
[11:22] people are try believing what what the
[11:24] media is writing or is it because of
[11:26] social media and decentralized media a
[11:29] little bit better than like 5 10 or 15
[11:32] years
[11:33] ago it's it's difficult to answer that
[11:36] question because I think when the BBC
[11:38] maybe could have been trustworthy maybe
[11:41] about 40 years ago possibly most people
[11:44] just went to a newspaper or one news
[11:47] source and that was the only news source
[11:49] so they didn't have the same options but
[11:52] at the same time I think journalism was
[11:54] real journalism there people would
[11:56] actually go and find the story so it was
[11:59] actually more trustworthy now we're
[12:02] being controlled by algorithms and we
[12:04] don't even know if what we're thinking
[12:06] is real or what we believe is true and
[12:10] people are time poor so they don't have
[12:12] the time like he said to go off and do
[12:15] the research read three or four
[12:17] different things but even when you're
[12:18] being targeted by an algorithm how do
[12:21] you know that you're just not being
[12:22] targeted by the same wrong information
[12:26] it's really difficult to know yeah this
[12:29] the this algorithm thing is a is a real
[12:32] Beast because you just have to O open my
[12:35] feed on um like I sometimes do that I I
[12:39] go on my girlfriend's phone and just
[12:41] open the her feet and it's a completely
[12:44] different experience like there's
[12:46] there's not one thing that is on my side
[12:49] and on her side like two different
[12:51] worlds and I think that's that's um
[12:55] something to to at least worry a little
[12:58] bit about I mean we know why the
[13:00] algorithms work like that and uh to a
[13:02] certain extent uh I think it's okay uh
[13:05] but we have to be aware of that and we
[13:07] have to really like uh figure out like
[13:10] okay what what do I want to consume you
[13:12] cannot consume everything anyways uh but
[13:16] just relying on an algorithm might be a
[13:19] bad idea especially how how personalized
[13:21] they are and how you basically just look
[13:24] at what are you engaging with uh and
[13:27] then that you that that will you get
[13:30] like that's why I'm always laughing when
[13:32] someone is like enraged in the comments
[13:34] and it's like oh that's such a video I
[13:36] don't like those on my feet and I'm like
[13:38] yeah you just clicked on the video and
[13:40] you left the comment so you gave the
[13:41] algorithm every everything to believe
[13:43] that you will get more of those videos
[13:46] um I think that the awareness of how
[13:48] those algorithms work that alone helps a
[13:51] lot uh but yeah it's a real thing they
[13:53] they give you your own world and they
[13:56] they make the bias and the echo chamber
[13:58] a real thing
[13:59] I think Jack dorsy is trying to address
[14:01] that when I saw him I went to nostri
[14:04] which was an absolutely brilliant
[14:05] conference and then Baltic honey badger
[14:07] was uh thereafter but he said he loved
[14:10] building Twitter but he said that the
[14:12] algorithm has taken too much and that's
[14:15] why he's starting to build nosta with
[14:18] relays and a completely different
[14:20] decentralized model of information now I
[14:24] I have my concerns about that as well
[14:26] but at the same time I don't want
[14:27] information to be censored we saw what
[14:29] happened during the pandemic even Mark
[14:32] Zuckerberg's coming out and saying I'm
[14:33] not doing it anymore and and the Twitter
[14:35] files with Matt tyab proved that the CIA
[14:40] and and the US government were actually
[14:41] going in and asking them to remove posts
[14:44] the misinformation is an a tricky thing
[14:47] for me because uh we don't want
[14:50] misinformation but at the same time if
[14:52] we have some Authority on
[14:55] misinformation that what's the
[14:57] difference to censorship then like
[14:59] that's really hard and also facts can
[15:01] actually uh change over time so that
[15:03] like that's that's it's really hard to
[15:06] to to figure it out what's your stance
[15:07] on
[15:08] like should we have some some
[15:11] misinformation or guiding it's a it goes
[15:14] a little bit also with with the with the
[15:16] article of of of PBC because that's
[15:18] clearly misinformation that's probably
[15:20] that's provable um but but who's the the
[15:23] one that says like oh this this should
[15:25] be
[15:26] deleted the BBC
[15:29] say they are
[15:32] unbiased and that they are the Arbiter
[15:34] of Truth so when it gets pointed out to
[15:37] them that something that they've written
[15:39] isn't true it shouldn't take 10 plus
[15:42] months to try and get it
[15:45] retracted they set themselves up as that
[15:48] as that Central focal point so they've
[15:51] got no excuse It's not they're not
[15:52] writing opinion pieces and then if they
[15:55] are then they should make it clear that
[15:56] they're writing opinion pieces and and
[15:58] that's too but when it comes to
[16:02] censoring
[16:04] information I I'm not comfortable with
[16:07] having a central Authority deciding
[16:12] what's right and what's wrong I don't
[16:14] have an answer for it but one thing that
[16:16] I do feel quite strongly about is I I
[16:18] think that we're getting to this point
[16:20] where governments are able to sensor
[16:23] more and more under the guise of
[16:25] protecting children so they're saying
[16:28] that children are being harmed because
[16:30] of the content that they're seeing yet
[16:32] we're normalizing giving iPads to
[16:35] 2-year-olds and I think that maybe
[16:39] there's some level of
[16:42] societal a discourse that needs to
[16:44] happen where we say hang on a sec their
[16:46] brains are forming we can't control the
[16:48] information that they're seeing adults
[16:50] can see what they like they can make
[16:52] their own choices but really should we
[16:54] be giving phones to under 18y olds like
[16:57] why has that become normal I think that
[16:59] that's really the problem that I have
[17:01] yeah especially with the very young
[17:03] child like under 12 that's like I mean I
[17:06] think got my first phone like 16 17 18
[17:10] uh some somewhere around those lines uh
[17:12] I think under 18 uh it's it's still bad
[17:15] but especially under 15 that's uh that's
[17:18] like really problematic uh and
[17:21] everything under 10 is just
[17:24] like get get your kid outside and let it
[17:27] play with real things
[17:29] uh and maybe like there was a lot of
[17:32] Articles like actually writing not just
[17:34] on on on the phone and like writing of
[17:37] your hand and stuff like that I am
[17:39] almost not able to do that like because
[17:43] like oh yeah it's it's so hard I I think
[17:46] once a month or something like that
[17:47] there's something coming along that
[17:49] where I have to do it
[17:52] know I've got like endless notes on my
[17:55] desk of just stuff that I've just write
[17:58] all day long like do you not write
[17:59] anymore no I write almost never like uh
[18:04] sometimes I have to fill something out
[18:06] when I'm somewhere with the
[18:09] government um uh um yeah almost right
[18:13] now like some maybe a note or something
[18:16] like that quickly leaving something I
[18:18] have um um shopping list we have in the
[18:21] fridge where sometimes write something
[18:23] but that's very rarely like and that's
[18:25] just a few words like
[18:27] 99.99999% of my writing is done by
[18:30] computer like uh it has ended since I
[18:33] left school in school I was forced to uh
[18:36] a cool uh they are forcing you to ride
[18:39] with the hands there's not a lot of with
[18:41] written with with the computer some
[18:43] things are comput computer written but
[18:45] most of the things are just uh with the
[18:47] handwritten and since then um I don't
[18:50] know no I I have no physical notebook my
[18:53] girlfriend has a physical notebook she
[18:54] writes two times three times per day but
[18:57] I'm not
[18:59] I take this everywhere with me and every
[19:00] conference I go to I literally write
[19:03] absolutely everything down so I'm
[19:04] surprised you don't write I write all
[19:06] the time but my hand does get achy I
[19:08] don't know I don't I don't do that it's
[19:10] uh but I think there are actually
[19:12] advantages to doing that like there's
[19:14] advantages to writing per hand I heard
[19:16] that a lot yeah I I like it I actually
[19:19] like the feeling of writing but what
[19:21] going back to the iPad thing is now I
[19:24] see kids and they have iPads with these
[19:27] Special casings around them to protect
[19:29] them and handles and I even saw this um
[19:32] this little lad that had like a strap
[19:34] around his neck with the iPad attached
[19:36] to the bottom so that it was constantly
[19:38] there and and where these are like two
[19:41] three year olds and it's just and then
[19:43] you see kids walk like in in push chairs
[19:46] and they're not looking around them
[19:48] they're not taking in the world we are
[19:51] heading for one hell of a crisis when it
[19:54] comes to this so when my biggest concern
[19:57] when it comes to what children see
[19:59] online I think it just comes down to
[20:01] don't give them access to the online
[20:03] world as young as they've got it because
[20:06] people say that you can lock it down but
[20:08] they'll find workarounds and most
[20:10] parents don't have a clue so you know I
[20:14] just honestly just let's stop
[20:16] normalizing this dangerous harmful tech
[20:19] for children maybe that's the answer and
[20:22] you also said uh they use that as an
[20:24] excuse for then censoring information
[20:27] because they have it so that's like the
[20:29] the second factor to that yeah do you
[20:31] want to harm children do you want to
[20:32] protect children well of course I want
[20:34] to protect children well then we need
[20:36] access to this this this and this we
[20:38] need to be able to have back doors that
[20:40] are in that were once encrypted we need
[20:43] the Online safety Bill where we can get
[20:45] access to what you know and they start
[20:47] to build
[20:50] these awful orwellian solutions that
[20:54] they sell to people as protection yeah
[20:57] that makes total sense
[20:59] um one one thing I was also wondering um
[21:02] with with Bitcoin right now uh and
[21:05] mainstream media and politics it it
[21:08] seems like Bitcoin get really get sucked
[21:11] into the whole political scene
[21:13] especially now with the US election that
[21:15] was completely unforeseen for me I was
[21:17] not expecting it to be such a big topic
[21:21] on the other hand in Europe it's not
[21:23] that big of a topic we are more talking
[21:25] about cbdcs we we want to obviously want
[21:29] to have the CC and the digital Euro and
[21:31] we really have to get this uh I like I'm
[21:34] a little Envy of the US because they
[21:37] really take a big stand against cbdcs
[21:40] I'm I'm I'm a little Envy of of their
[21:42] stands of the cbdcs how political do you
[21:45] see uh Bitcoin and then maybe also a
[21:47] little bit into cbdcs as it was also my
[21:50] my first touch point with you well I
[21:53] watched Trump's speech in Nashville um
[21:56] it was just an extension of the campaign
[21:58] tra I mean like 34s of it was just fluff
[22:01] and nonsense um he used Bitcoin and
[22:05] crypto interchangeably I don't know if
[22:07] that was because he hadn't been briefed
[22:08] properly or if it was on purpose because
[22:10] he just wants to please everybody um but
[22:13] the fact that he was there is a is a big
[22:16] deal the fact that RFK was there um I
[22:19] think uh Camala Harris miss a trick by
[22:23] not getting involved um but what when
[22:27] the US does something the rest of the
[22:29] world follows so I think it will trickle
[22:32] down eventually if the right people are
[22:34] banging the drum so we have a chance in
[22:36] the Europe uh Zone and UK also that we
[22:40] might be able to not have cbdcs not have
[22:43] how the cbdc is is the CBC even called
[22:45] britcoin or something like that I heard
[22:47] something in the UK oh yeah they did
[22:50] they called it it I knew it was coming
[22:52] but it's oh britcoin really like so in
[22:55] Jamaica there's have you seen there's a
[22:57] thing called the cbdc tracker that was
[22:59] developed by the human rights foundation
[23:01] so you can see on there where um the the
[23:06] different stages that countries are at
[23:08] so if they're in the research phase
[23:10] pilot mode or if they've launched and so
[23:12] Jamaica is one of the countries that's
[23:15] launched but has no onoff ramps for
[23:17] Bitcoin at all and I had my old boss was
[23:20] from Jamaica and when I was speaking to
[23:21] her about it I was like oh my goodness
[23:23] gosh you guys are really far ahead when
[23:25] it comes to cbdcs and she just went oh
[23:27] what the Jamaican Bitcoin and I'm like
[23:29] don't you call it
[23:31] that it is not the Jamaican Bitcoin it's
[23:33] completely different and once I
[23:35] explained it to her she was horrified
[23:37] because that is not how it's being sold
[23:39] over there yes exactly that looks really
[23:42] cool so so like the green ones that have
[23:45] it research or the red ones are already
[23:49] launched wow yeah China that's a lot of
[23:51] red China yeah Kazakhstan Russia India
[23:54] also has one already country and it
[23:56] actually gives you the stats on it click
[23:57] on that one and see uh so so Nigeria's
[24:00] been a bit of a failure um but you can
[24:03] see the stats and oh man yeah that's
[24:07] really it's a cool website I love it I
[24:10] didn't knew about it but how can
[24:13] I and so you yeah so so we are still in
[24:18] the research phase and we had the I
[24:22] because I'm also a director and
[24:24] co-founder of Bitcoin policy UK and the
[24:26] head of Mining and energy and and a few
[24:29] weeks ago we had cbc's a silent attack
[24:32] on Democracy question mark and we
[24:34] invited the bank of England to come
[24:36] along and they actually refused they
[24:39] didn't want to talk to us about it not
[24:40] that they weren't available they
[24:42] actually refused but when you look at
[24:44] the form that you had to fill into
[24:45] request a speaker it was on this utterly
[24:48]  like document Word document I
[24:51] thought my God if you can't in this day
[24:53] and age if you can't even make a form
[24:55] look good how on Earth are you going to
[24:57] rewrite find
[24:59] like there's no way that they don't
[25:00] stand a chance but there was this really
[25:02] lovely chap who was actually um working
[25:05] at the digital pound Foundation who
[25:07] really bravely came along to speak at
[25:09] our event the only person in the room
[25:12] that was Pro cbdcs he sees the system
[25:15] exactly like we do he sees us being
[25:17] manipulated he sees problems with money
[25:20] he sees it all and I realized that we
[25:22] agreed on about 80% and it's really good
[25:24] when you can speak to people who are
[25:26] opposed to things that
[25:29] you know they're four things that you're
[25:30] opposed to because if you can find the
[25:32] common ground it's a lot more helpful
[25:35] what I realized is he actually believes
[25:38] that the UK can design a good cbdc so in
[25:42] his head he doesn't see them as evil
[25:44] because they haven't even been designed
[25:45] yet I thought that was really
[25:47] interesting um but I do think that it's
[25:49] really naive as well considering it
[25:51] seems to be a global push across the
[25:53] world and nobody else has designed a
[25:55] good one and where they have launched
[25:57] they failed
[25:58] the question is like how would you
[26:00] design a good one because it's all
[26:02] centrally controlled like how how would
[26:05] a good CBC look like well um ecash is a
[26:09] is is a good example of of something
[26:11] that because because we're using ecash
[26:14] with Bitcoin so you know there are there
[26:16] are solutions but the the technical
[26:18] abilities that these guys have they they
[26:20] no one who's going to design a good cbdc
[26:24] is going to go near a project like that
[26:27] for me the the the the biggest problem
[26:29] is there when we establish completely
[26:32] digital money that is not decentralized
[26:35] like Bitcoin but is centrally uh
[26:38] controlled no matter how it's designed
[26:40] and how it's technically designed yeah
[26:43] that opens the door even if it's not the
[26:46] intention of someone that does it right
[26:47] now that opens the door that someone
[26:49] comes along at some point and misuses
[26:52] that technology to control and abuse
[26:55] people yeah that's for me the biggest
[26:58] thing like no matter how it's designed
[27:00] as long as it's centrally controlled by
[27:02] by like a few people or maybe even just
[27:04] one person uh that that's a huge problem
[27:07] for me in itself and it's a honey pot
[27:09] for
[27:10] hackers a major honey pot yeah it's the
[27:13] same thing with the coinbase honeybot
[27:15] with all the ETFs there yeah yeah yeah
[27:18] yeah I know it's Madness yeah but but
[27:21] the the the chat um at the digital pound
[27:23] Foundation was listening to us and he
[27:26] wants to have a meeting about how we
[27:29] would design a good cbdc I I do want to
[27:33] talk to him but at the same time I'm
[27:35] thinking this is a complete waste of
[27:37] time it's going to fail like you're not
[27:39] going to do it I could I could I could
[27:42] give you some suggestions but just just
[27:46] just go with Bitcoin look look at
[27:48] Bitcoin because like you can't
[27:50] understand what a good cbdc is going to
[27:52] look like until you understand Bitcoin
[27:54] and if you understand Bitcoin you
[27:55] wouldn't be working on the projects so
[27:57] just
[27:59] just look at
[28:01] Bitcoin Journey isn't it everyone's at a
[28:03] different stage is is there a chance
[28:06] that that you see that UK and the Euro
[28:08] zone is actually adopting Bitcoin within
[28:10] the next like 20 30 years I think it's
[28:13] Game Theory I think once the US get on
[28:16] board you've got you know once the price
[28:19] pumps to a level that they can't ignore
[28:22] it Global adoption is ramping up it's
[28:26] quicker than the internet adoption um
[28:29] it's a
[28:31] global decentralized neutral
[28:34] peer-to-peer cash how can that not
[28:37] change the world I think that once Game
[28:39] Theory kicks in they're all going to
[28:41] have to do it and I even wrote an
[28:42] article over a year ago about how
[28:45] because the brics currencies are talking
[28:46] about how they want to have their own
[28:49] almost like an alternative to the
[28:51] petrade dollar but they want it to be
[28:52] backed by Commodities so China will back
[28:57] their part by gold and Russia will back
[28:59] it partly in oil but that requires trust
[29:03] and verification and effort you know if
[29:05] it could be backed by a commodity that's
[29:07] really easy to verify and open source it
[29:10] just makes way more sense so they're not
[29:12] quite there yet but I think once they
[29:15] get there they're going to realize that
[29:17] it's a
[29:18] no-brainer is is Bitcoin maybe just and
[29:21] it's it's it's weird to say that because
[29:23] it's already like 15 years old it is
[29:25] already uh quite large but is it might
[29:28] might be just too small at that point uh
[29:30] that nations are really saying like oh
[29:33] we we would like to have it as a as a
[29:35] backing look it's not small as in you
[29:38] mean how much Bitcoin is available
[29:41] because it's divisible yeah no no no uh
[29:44] as as a as a market cap I think a lot of
[29:47] those people might I meanes 15 years old
[29:51] and it can't grow that quickly we can't
[29:53] I mean if it grew that quickly it just
[29:55] wouldn't work it has to be slow and
[29:57] methodical and and and the pace that
[29:59] it's growing at the moment for me is
[30:01] even too quick yeah I I worry about that
[30:04] because we don't have the layer twos
[30:06] that we need lightning I'm not sure if
[30:08] that's ready yet um there's a lot more
[30:11] work to do to make it a viable global
[30:14] system the fear of Bitcoin growing too
[30:17] fast I think that we already covered
[30:19] that once but it's it's a real thing
[30:21] like if if Bitcoin extremely fast gets
[30:24] adopted and all the feeld Curren is
[30:27] crashing too fast
[30:29] uh we we might not be there with all the
[30:30] technology that we actually need for
[30:32] Bitcoin to be successful as a payment
[30:35] system that that's a real thing is that
[30:37] is that actually a fear of yours it's
[30:40] it's a concern that I have I mean among
[30:44] many um one of one of many concerns but
[30:48] yes it is one okay uh do you have more
[30:52] concerns about about Bitcoin or like the
[30:54] the financial world what what do you
[30:56] mean with more concerns so I think I
[30:59] think that there are two you've got the
[31:02] typical Maxi who just believes in
[31:05] Bitcoin and then you've got kind of
[31:07] purists who just take it too far like I
[31:10] would say that I'm a pragmatic Maxi so
[31:13] I'm open-minded to other Solutions and I
[31:16] don't know what's going to work and
[31:18] what's going to fail um but I do think
[31:21] that we need to experiment more and
[31:25] welcome the experimentation so that we
[31:27] can eventually find these Solutions
[31:29] rather than having all these rules in
[31:31] place that oh you could be a bitcoiner
[31:33] if you think like me and this this this
[31:35] and this you know I think I think we're
[31:37] yeah we we're just too um we need to be
[31:40] more openminded and I think that
[31:42] providing the base layer stays
[31:45] completely
[31:46] decentralized we will have to build
[31:49] centralized Solutions on top but I think
[31:53] that the solutions will range from
[31:54] centralized to decentralized um in and
[31:57] everything in between and people will
[31:59] have to make choices on the tradeoffs
[32:01] that they want to make based on what
[32:02] they need it for so um so I'm
[32:06] comfortable with a little bit of
[32:08] centralization when if it's sitting on
[32:10] top of the base layer providing the base
[32:12] layer is completely decentralized I just
[32:15] think we have to be uh more open-minded
[32:18] to find these Solutions it seems like
[32:20] sometimes the Bitcoin Community might be
[32:23] too missionary even outside of Bitcoin
[32:27] and this idea like you have to eat meat
[32:30] you have to own guns you have to do this
[32:32] like it's like this this idea of like a
[32:34] full Bitcoin that that goes too far
[32:37] sometimes for me I'm like hey Bitcoin is
[32:40] for everyone if you don't want to if
[32:42] you're we like I know a lot of wings
[32:44] that are popular even in the Bitcoin
[32:46] scene that uh that that are really big
[32:48] and and that are also as much Bitcoin as
[32:52] someone that it's only kind for it's
[32:54] it's it's fascinating for me how people
[32:57] give their values on the Bitcoin and
[32:59] think everyone else also has to has to
[33:02] think like that exactly that and it's
[33:04] very destructive very destructive
[33:06] especially and going back to what you
[33:08] said earlier about it becoming political
[33:11] I'm not entirely comfortable with the
[33:13] fact that Bitcoin seems to have this
[33:15] right-wing narrative so I and I also
[33:18] don't like the terms left and right I
[33:20] think they're super lazy and it's just
[33:21] like once again it's a spectrum how can
[33:24] you be on one side or the other why are
[33:26] you not deciding in individually on each
[33:28] case how you feel about something rather
[33:31] than going into a bucket of Lefty ideas
[33:33] or a bucket of rightwing ideas it's a
[33:36] little bit like in America where if you
[33:38] were a Democrat you wore a mask and if
[33:40] you're a republican you rejected it I
[33:43] just don't see how these things work if
[33:45] you watch or listen to my podcast on a
[33:47] regular basis I'll guess you already
[33:49] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[33:52] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[33:55] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[33:57] personal recommendation for hard wallet
[33:59] is the bit box it's super secure it's
[34:02] simple to set up it's also perfect gift
[34:04] for a friend who has still the Bitcoin

[34:38] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[34:41] in case something goes really really
[34:42] wrong and through all those steps the

[35:00] not least I have something completely
[35:02] new for you guys I partnered up with
[35:06] coin vigilante this is the most
[35:08] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[35:11] saw created by anyone look at that
[35:14] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[35:17] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[35:20] the perfect subtle elent way to go out
[35:23] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[35:25] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[35:29] make sure to check out the link in the
[35:31] description for those amazing coin
[35:33] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[35:36] amazing I love them so much it was
[35:37] really hard for me to pick the one that
[35:40] I want to have because there are a lot
[35:42] of great options I went with the new
[35:44] transparency Edition they are all
[35:47] limited so grab yours those will not be
[35:50] available for a long time but there will
[35:52] come new models and new amazing designs
[35:55] along the way that seems I'm mean
[35:57] America is more extreme because like
[35:58] there's just two parties that's like
[36:01] that that that that seems to be uh in
[36:04] Austria we have five parties now I
[36:06] cannot decide one but but it's uh but
[36:10] it's it's a real thing like I think I
[36:12] think it's a fact that like from
[36:15] political scale probably more on the
[36:17] right side have more Bitcoin than the
[36:19] those on the left side it it seems like
[36:21] it seems like that but it's not like
[36:24] that uh Bitcoin is right or left it's
[36:26] apolitical it's it's it's it's a money
[36:28] and it's maybe adopted at a different uh
[36:31] speed at different demographics I think
[36:33] that's all like I think I hope those
[36:35] narratives around what a Bitcoin looks
[36:38] like goes away because Bitcoin hopefully
[36:40] will be something like water or air
[36:44] where it's so normal and you don't say
[36:45] like oh you pref air then you have to be
[36:47] a right wi gun owner like no you don't
[36:50] have to yeah no ABS absolutely but you
[36:54] know like you said it's a 15year old
[36:56] asset it's still in its infancy and you
[37:00] know it will it will grow out of these
[37:02] these things I
[37:04] think another thing that is in the
[37:06] Bitcoin Community um is there are not as
[37:10] many um women as there there should be I
[37:13] feel like it's like uh mostly M
[37:16] dominated I see it at least in all my
[37:18] statistics that I have available to me
[37:21] most of my audience is male and then
[37:23] people say like oh because you're male
[37:24] no uh the most popular uh female podcast
[37:29] uh is Natalie Brunell and she posted the
[37:31] statistics where she only has 20% uh
[37:34] female audience so it's definitely not
[37:37] because I'm a male uh host it's just
[37:39] also on on female host side uh so that's
[37:43] there there's this interesting argument
[37:45] like why is that like that I think most
[37:48] people tell me like oh yeah uh women are
[37:50] more interested in people and and man
[37:52] are more interested in in in things but
[37:55] I feel like you can be interested in
[37:57] people and interested in in
[37:59] Bitcoin do do you as as a woman um why
[38:04] do you think there are not more of them
[38:06] is is the Bitcoin Community um is is
[38:09] that right wi male Focus maybe that's
[38:12] the distractive thing that we are not
[38:15] welcoming enough for for new people I
[38:18] think there's a few things that I've
[38:21] noticed um first of all I do think that
[38:24] men are
[38:25] generally the earlier doctors mainly
[38:28] because they've got more time to look
[38:29] into things that interest them so just
[38:32] before I came on this podcast I was like
[38:34] getting the washing done I was trying to
[38:36] prep for dinner I had to finish a
[38:38] research report that I was doing I'm
[38:40] constantly all over the place trying to
[38:42] get everything done my husband is
[38:44] brilliant but he leaves goes to work
[38:47] comes back and all these things are done
[38:49] for him so he he just naturally has more
[38:52] time than I do so I think that women get
[38:54] on board when things become more certain
[38:58] rather than in the beginning days when
[39:01] it's a little bit more
[39:03] experimental um then by that time the
[39:06] boys clubs have already developed and so
[39:10] it's a little bit tricky to become a
[39:13] part of large male groups for a couple
[39:17] of reasons really some men might feel
[39:20] more comfortable with men men do favors
[39:22] for each other a lot more than they
[39:24] would do favors for women Mo most of the
[39:27] opportunities that I've had in this
[39:29] space have come from women and I'm
[39:32] guessing that that's what it so if
[39:33] there's more men more men have more
[39:35] opportunities and I and one guy and I'm
[39:39] not saying that this is correct actually
[39:41] said he felt women were actively
[39:44] excluded from speaking at events and the
[39:49] like um I know that I've got some
[39:52] friends that feel that say if you're
[39:55] sitting uh on a on a stool or something
[39:57] at an event a man will walk up to a man
[40:00] and ignore the woman even though they're
[40:02] probably of equal that it's it's a it's
[40:06] social conditioning as well I think it's
[40:09] like a programming maybe um I think I
[40:12] think there's lots lots of reasons as to
[40:16] why I I I don't know if it's a quick I
[40:19] don't think there's any kind of quick
[40:20] fix really I don't think it's anyone's
[40:23] fault either I think it's just the the
[40:26] way that it happens it's Society we we
[40:29] we don't live in an equal World um and
[40:33] we have different roles just I mean
[40:35] think about it like hundred years ago
[40:37] women didn't even have the vote and
[40:38] we've had to kind of build up from that
[40:40] and so getting to a point where you're
[40:44] respected um listened to except you know
[40:48] it's not it's not it's not going to be
[40:50] easy because my mom for example her
[40:55] brother got sent to University and she
[40:56] did
[40:58] her role was going to be a cashier in a
[40:59] bank he went on to be an optician so
[41:04] even just one generation
[41:06] back they were disadvantaged and not
[41:09] treated the same so it's going to take a
[41:11] little while before that gets washed out
[41:15] I think uh the the goal is anyways that
[41:18] the whole world has Bitcoin that then
[41:20] it's equal the end it will definitely be
[41:22] equal but what do you think what do you
[41:24] think about the things that I've said do
[41:26] you think that they Sound Logic or is
[41:27] there anything that I said that you
[41:29] think doesn't sound right I don't know
[41:31] about the time aspect uh that's the only
[41:33] thing that was not logical to me
[41:36] 100%
[41:38] um but yeah it's it's an interesting
[41:41] argument because uh it's I I don't know
[41:45] about the time aspect uh but I don't
[41:47] also don't know if it's not real I don't
[41:49] have a good argument against it the only
[41:51] thing that I 100% know is my own
[41:54] experience when I go in my friend Circle
[41:56] and tell
[41:58] male friends of mine hey there's this
[42:00] Bitcoin thing you want to check it out
[42:02] um male are way more uh easier to jump
[42:06] on like oh okay let's do it there's 100
[42:09] EUR where can I buy it like they they
[42:11] are like if if they are good friends of
[42:13] mine they're like oh let's let's try
[42:15] let's let's find out with female friends
[42:17] I have way more hurdles to go over like
[42:20] it takes a little bit more convincing of
[42:23] that's maybe just because I'm male U
[42:25] that's maybe that's just a natural thing
[42:27] of of mine but I've seen that male are
[42:30] more just jumping into a risk uh
[42:33] apparent risk for them even though
[42:35] Bitcoin is not risky and maybe uh female
[42:38] are more The Collector type that they
[42:41] they want to uh not risk uh they're
[42:46] maybe not that risk taking I don't know
[42:48] like that's that's just like a a very
[42:50] subjective feeling that I got from
[42:52] Orange ping friends uh but one of my uh
[42:57] friends that is most impressive to me uh
[42:59] what with the orange billing process is
[43:02] a female she's amazing she's even coming
[43:04] to me with me to to bitcoin Amsterdam he
[43:07] there yeah I I will be there uh it's
[43:10] it's actually my first Speaker
[43:11] engagement I will be the first time
[43:13] speaking at bit at a Bitcoin conference
[43:16] uh I think with with prum and and and
[43:19] two other people I don't know the the uh
[43:22] the the stage I think Captain sit is the
[43:25] other one I forgot the other name oh
[43:27] sorry about that yeah it's I'm I will be
[43:30] on stage I will be moderating I'm
[43:32] looking forward to that uh but yeah
[43:34] she's coming uh with me and I think
[43:36] she's the friend that actually got it
[43:38] the best uh till now and and that's
[43:41] interesting yeah but more I have have
[43:44] more male friends that have it and
[43:46] they're all in and it's it's like even
[43:47] the have so funny because she has uh not
[43:51] all her money in Bitcoin but she
[43:52] understands it very well but I have male
[43:55] friends have had all your money all
[43:57] their money in Bitcoin but they don't
[43:59] understand it that well so it's maybe
[44:02] that's just a subjective thing for mind
[44:04] that like uh male are taking more risk
[44:07] or like are quicker to jump into
[44:09] something um but that's just an
[44:11] observation from mine but it's also
[44:14] difficult having the conversation
[44:15] because whatever I say will probably
[44:17] offend somebody because they'll think
[44:19] someone will be listening to it thinking
[44:21] that it's a direct dig and it isn't in
[44:25] any way at all so it's a really hard
[44:27] thing to have a conversation about
[44:29] openly because I feel like someone's
[44:32] going to get offended by something that
[44:33] I
[44:34] say yes it's interesting um when we talk
[44:38] about something uh that is controversial
[44:41] I think that should not be controversial
[44:44] no uh because one thing that it's for
[44:47] certain there are differences between
[44:49] male and female and we should not uh
[44:52] pretend that they the complete equal
[44:55] like from from just like from their
[44:57] properties uh they are doing different
[44:59] things and they're do it's not like one
[45:01] thing is better than the other thing
[45:03] they're just like different uh the same
[45:05] way that 80y old uh guy is different
[45:08] from a 10y old guy uh if you understand
[45:12] what I mean well yeah I I do but I I
[45:14] don't actually like that argument
[45:17] because I think that everybody has a
[45:19] different brain and they all have
[45:21] different skill sets and different
[45:22] abilities and when you pigeon hole
[45:25] somebody because they're male or female
[45:28] you're assuming that they have a certain
[45:30] type of brain or a certain type of
[45:32] thinking or certain attributes but
[45:34] really we should be looking at people as
[45:36] individual and taking them on face value
[45:38] rather than assuming what they're like
[45:41] based on their
[45:42] gender yeah that's a good point that's a
[45:45] very good point I mean there there are
[45:47] definitely if you take the average here
[45:50] but that's like putting someone in a in
[45:53] in a in a in a drawer it's like female
[45:57] understand what you're what taking but
[45:58] the average uh you can make the
[46:00] differences average when you look at an
[46:03] average but definitely on an individual
[46:05] size like everyone is so different and
[46:07] uh there's there there are so many
[46:10] different examples of that like on on an
[46:12] individual level so I think that's a
[46:14] it's a it's a good point but yeah maybe
[46:17] uh maybe it's should be a a topic that
[46:20] should not even be a topic and we should
[46:22] just take it as face value uh and it
[46:25] will turn out naturally because then uh
[46:27] it it's not that big of a topic maybe
[46:31] maybe that discussion is not even uh the
[46:34] fact that we have the discussion kind of
[46:36] U makes the topic harder like is do do
[46:40] you follow my logic so yeah yeah no well
[46:43] It's Tricky and it will work itself out
[46:45] I mean it has to if we want Global
[46:47] adoption it has to be 50/50 so yeah
[46:50] hopefully yeah how long do you think um
[46:53] we will we will be be at uh that that
[46:56] point where we have a major Bitcoin
[46:58] adoption if we are successful I don't
[47:00] know what I don't know what Global
[47:03] adoption looks like I don't know how
[47:05] many users would have to be on board for
[47:07] it to be considered Global adoption um
[47:11] but I think in the next cycle I think uh
[47:14] I think it's going to happen a lot
[47:16] quicker than than we think because I
[47:18] think a lot of countries are starting to
[47:20] pay attention but I think they're
[47:21] keeping it quiet and I don't think
[47:24] they're advertising what their plans are
[47:28] so I I think that I think it could
[47:32] happen really quickly when it does yeah
[47:35] I hope so too and they're probably if I
[47:39] would be a country and I have the chance
[47:41] and I I get
[47:43] Bitcoin uh and I slowly start buying it
[47:46] and I don't have to disclose it I will
[47:49] not disclose it that would be stupid of
[47:53] me yeah so that that could be a one if I
[47:57] was mining it either I I would I would
[47:59] try and keep that quiet too I mean we
[48:02] know of some count with like El Salvador
[48:04] and and how is it called pan bua
[48:08] something like that they buying they
[48:09] were buying it on the slide they've got
[48:11] something like not point one for every
[48:14] citizen haven't they that's what they
[48:16] managed to get I think I heard something
[48:19] with like 700 million in total but I
[48:22] could be wrong I think something I I
[48:25] read but yeah they they have they have
[48:27] Bitcoin and and that's amazing the small
[48:30] countries that have Bitcoin but I think
[48:32] everyone is waiting for like the first
[48:34] big country like Argentina uh that would
[48:37] be a a great one or maybe like Germany
[48:41] even though they sold their
[48:43] Bitcoin They confiscated it's an it's an
[48:47] interesting
[48:48] discussion is interesting because they U
[48:51] melee just wants the freedom to
[48:54] transact which seems like the most
[48:56] sensible way to go that if you want to
[49:00] transact in Apples because that is
[49:02] useful to you then go for it you know if
[49:05] you want to transact in Bitcoin then
[49:06] that's fine too I think his point is
[49:09] that people should choose the type of
[49:14] currency that is useful to them in that
[49:17] moment without being
[49:19] told you have to use the US dollar or
[49:23] you have to use this so I think I think
[49:25] the freedom to transaction is the most
[49:27] sensible way to go that would be I would
[49:30] love that I mean it's a different route
[49:32] that El Salvador took because they are
[49:34] actively trying to get rid of uh um
[49:37] altcoins
[49:38] shitcoins um and they're really trying
[49:40] to to push Bitcoin uh I think they are
[49:44] really like trying to to get ahead they
[49:46] taking the startup approach but I think
[49:48] for a bigger country like antina it
[49:51] would be way more clever to do it like M
[49:53] said like oh yeah we we lift all the C
[49:56] game on on bitcoin on those things and
[49:59] if you want to transact and pay with
[50:01] Bitcoin for your local beer or whatever
[50:05] uh you should not be having capital
[50:08] gains tax on that like you should be
[50:10] just able to freely transact with that
[50:13] and I think that's a a really cool
[50:15] approach and um I'm waiting for when
[50:18] America does that because then it's like
[50:21] the We Off to the Races for the
[50:23] international game with the UK with the
[50:26] Euro Zone
[50:27] I I would I would love to I would love
[50:29] to see
[50:30] that really really cool before we come
[50:32] to the end routine of the podcast um I I
[50:35] would like to ask a question um is there
[50:38] anything that I forgot to ask you is
[50:40] there anything uh uh important topic for
[50:43] you that that you would like to discuss
[50:45] in the podcast or bring in the podcast
[50:47] that I forgot to to bring up I don't
[50:49] think so no I can't think of anything no
[50:53] everything that I'm focused on at the
[50:54] moment is just is to do with the
[50:57] BBC I'm just obsessed with it at the
[51:00] moment I'm so I'm so annoyed that they
[51:03] can get away with it that I almost I I I
[51:05] think about it in my sleep I'm just
[51:07] completely consumed by how how I can get
[51:10] this retraction so yeah at the
[51:13] moment I man it's it's it's really it's
[51:16] really weird that they can still have it
[51:18] up there I think it's 10 months you said
[51:20] it is right 10 months so it started so
[51:24] when I first started trying to I put
[51:26] like I said I put in a freedom of
[51:27] information request that got denied then
[51:29] I went to the information commissioner's
[51:32] office to see if I could get that denial
[51:34] overturned they upheld the BBC's um
[51:38] denial so then I was like okay I wrote
[51:42] to the journalist who wrote the article
[51:46] I wrote to the BBC crypto correspondent
[51:48] I wrote to the Press office and I got
[51:50] ignored the only person that confirmed
[51:53] receipt of the email was the crypto
[51:54] correspondent that's the only person
[51:56] that's been helpful in this whole thing
[51:57] so then I reached another dead end and
[52:00] then I reached back out to all of them
[52:02] again and then it was only in June that
[52:03] the Press office said why don't you go
[52:05] to editorial complaints well this whole
[52:07] time that I've been hammering at the
[52:09] door no one had told me about editorial
[52:11] complaints I couldn't find anything
[52:13] about it um so I
[52:16] submitted I submitted that in June and
[52:19] then kept getting emails to say we're
[52:23] really sorry that this has taken this
[52:24] long we are working on it and then the
[52:26] second email that I got said we're aware
[52:28] that this has taken longer than we
[52:30] thought you should go to ofcom I like
[52:34] God another job yeah thanks okay so I go
[52:37] to ofcom fill out the form and then they
[52:38] send me back something that says thank
[52:40] you we've got your information we won't
[52:42] get back to you but but please know that
[52:44] we've got it and I'm like great so they
[52:46] literally sent me down another dead end
[52:49] which I just thought was terrible and
[52:51] then they when they did send the
[52:52] response back
[52:53] finally they hadn't taken any of my
[52:56] evidence into consideration they went
[52:59] back to the original discredited source
[53:03] to prove their discredited information
[53:06] it was really quite
[53:08] weird so um yeah so now it's just
[53:11] because I'm going round in all these
[53:13] circles trying to keep tabs of and and
[53:15] every time you have to submit something
[53:17] it's a chunk of work that I'm not
[53:19] getting paid for and the the F no
[53:22] actually I was going to say maybe cut
[53:24] this bit out but I would have got paid
[53:27] for the article that I wrote for Forbes
[53:29] but it got unpublished so the only thing
[53:31] that I could have got paid for so
[53:33] literally everything that I've done is
[53:36] all unpaid and there's no one there's no
[53:38] one who's going to pay journalists
[53:41] properly to do proper investig give work
[53:45] so that's why we have poor journalism
[53:46] because if you want to do something
[53:48] properly you have to do it off your own
[53:49] back uh that's that's sad for a certain
[53:52] extent it's it's it really is is weird
[53:56] uh what is what was the saying ofcom
[53:58] what was the last one ofcom so say if
[54:01] there's a complaint about something that
[54:03] you've seen on TV or heard on the radio
[54:06] or something like that you go to
[54:08] ofcom but when they suggested that they
[54:11] would have known that it was another
[54:12] dead end it's like do you know from estx
[54:15] and oix the one episode uh where they
[54:19] have to make an task and they have to
[54:22] find a form inside a government building
[54:24] and they'd like get uh the whole week or
[54:27] something like that pushed around like
[54:29] oh you have to go to this room this room
[54:30] this room this room and they are like
[54:32] always this those dead ends uh I don't
[54:35] know if I'm a big fan of that series but
[54:37] um maybe maybe it's not that popular
[54:39] outside of Austria I don't know and it's
[54:42] but it's it it reminds me of that and
[54:43] sometimes when I interact with something
[54:46] that is closer to the governments or is
[54:48] almost government it it it reminds me of
[54:51] that a lot you have to ah you have to
[54:52] fill out that form but you need that for
[54:55] that form and you have to go there
[54:57] oh you don't have that you first have to
[54:58] go there they always very um kind and
[55:02] very like oh yeah you have to F find
[55:04] this find this and very uh not personal
[55:08] and they're not really trying to help
[55:09] you they're just trying to get you away
[55:12] from you and then go to the next person
[55:15] maybe he can help you but I know he
[55:17] cannot help you so that's that's kind of
[55:19] the feeling I got from what you were
[55:21] describing with your dead ends yep yep
[55:24] it's just being tied up in bureaucracy
[55:26] see absolutely absolutely perfect then
[55:29] uh let's come to the outin there's two
[55:31] questions the first question is always
[55:32] the same question for each guest um
[55:34] first question uh what can we learn from
[55:36] you besides Bitcoin and all the things
[55:39] that we already talked about Bitcoin and
[55:41] besides Bitcoin am I allowed to say
[55:42] Bitcoin mining yeah why not okay so I
[55:47] Bitcoin mining is a is a big subject
[55:50] that I'm really interested in and the um
[55:53] carbon uh emissions reduction and the
[55:56] methane reduction and how you can mine
[55:58] off landfill and all the amazing things
[56:02] that Bitcoin mining can do so that so as
[56:05] I said I'm um the head of Mining and
[56:07] energy for bit Queen policy UK and we're
[56:10] looking at projects at the moment where
[56:12] we are looking to grow vegetables for
[56:15] disused sites trying to breathe life
[56:18] back into businesses using Bitcoin
[56:20] mining that would otherwise be Moss
[56:22] balled that's interesting I like that a
[56:24] lot really cool
[56:26] um yeah perfect then let's get to the
[56:28] other entro team where the previous
[56:29] guest is asking a question for the next
[56:31] guest without knowing who the next guest
[56:32] actually is uh the question for you is
[56:35] what scares you the most a world without
[56:37] Bitcoin or a world where Bitcoin gets
[56:40] captured as and functions as a world
[56:42] dystopian surveillance
[56:45] tool arianism and the world that my
[56:47] children are going to inherit to be
[56:49] seems to be the obvious answer yeah yeah
[56:53] exactly uh I hope I hope we can get to a
[56:55] world where there's Bitcoin and there is
[56:58] no distorion surveillance
[57:00] tool thank you so much uh Susie for
[57:03] being on um before I let you go where
[57:06] can people find you ask your questions

[57:12] well the BBC article got taken down
[57:14] unpublished so you can't find it Well
[57:17] you you could wait the BBC article with
[57:20] the swimming um oh that one okay yeah so
[57:26] sorry just Google um uh Bitcoin
[57:29] transaction swimming pool and it will
[57:31] come up and where can people uh find
[57:33] your stuff uh and and ask you questions
[57:35] if they have some so you can find my
[57:38] articles on Forbes I've also written
[57:40] opinion pieces for cityam I loved that I
[57:43] could rant about how broken the world
[57:44] was and then just write about how
[57:46] Bitcoin could fix it so that they're
[57:48] cool if you ever want to look at my work
