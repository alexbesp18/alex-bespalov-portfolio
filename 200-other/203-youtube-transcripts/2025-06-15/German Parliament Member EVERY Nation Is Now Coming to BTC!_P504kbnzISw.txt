[00:00] seeing all the plans Trump and his team
[00:02] have for Bitcoin I'm sure Europe will
[00:04] follow what they don't get it's not
[00:06] going anywhere and they can't ban it the
[00:08] people will still use it what I'm trying
[00:10] to push on them is how important Bitcoin
[00:12] is for human rights organization for the
[00:14] third world country for the developing
[00:16] countries we have now our own Freedom
[00:18] currency that the government can't take
[00:20] away from us that they can't censor that
[00:22] they can't inflate they can't steal the
[00:24] money from us anymore that's really
[00:26] powerful I fought for this country 11
[00:28] years in politics I did everything I
[00:30] could but if this socialist course is
[00:32] continuing I'm not going to stay here
[00:35] this is the best opportunity for Bitcoin
[00:37] mining because in Germany when you have
[00:38] a lot of sun a lot of wind we have way
[00:40] too much energy we have to get rid of
[00:42] the energy we have to pay other
[00:43] countries to take the energy to
[00:45] stabilize our grit so we pay millions
[00:47] for other countries just to take our
[00:49] ex's energy and your ground don't give
[00:52] in you have an opinion you're entitled
[00:54] to your opinion speak up that's the most
[00:56] important thing don't be afraid of
[00:57] speaking up we are more than they are if
[01:00] all the people speak up if we stick
[01:03] together they can't jail everybody the
[01:05] jails are not big enough for all of us
[01:07] so if all of us are speaking up they
[01:08] have no chance people forget that the
[01:10] politicians are our
[01:12] [Music]
[01:16] employees hi Janna how you doing
[01:18] everything fine on your end yes hi um
[01:22] I'm in billain right now uh it's it's
[01:24] time for the bundestag again uh our uh
[01:28] government collapsed couple of years a
[01:30] couple of weeks ago so there will be a
[01:32] new election in next February and we
[01:34] still have a lot of work to do really uh
[01:37] yeah really interesting I heard about
[01:39] that that they collapsed I think it was
[01:40] like a few weeks ago I heard it on the
[01:42] austan I I I turn I usually don't uh
[01:46] listen to mainstream media but I have
[01:47] this routine where once a week I just
[01:49] listen in there to see all the topics
[01:51] they're covering uh it's like half an
[01:53] hour every week to just keep up with
[01:55] where Austria is going and obviously
[01:57] Germany's also a big topic always there
[01:59] um just for people that know uh to to
[02:02] get a background especially because we
[02:04] have a big American uh viewership what
[02:06] is the the bundus tag and and who are
[02:09] you in in general the bonus tag is the
[02:12] German Parliament and I'm a member of
[02:14] the German Parliament since
[02:16] 2017 um I was a member of the afd when I
[02:19] joined the bundus T and I left my party
[02:21] two years ago so now I'm an independent
[02:24] member of the German bundes tag and it's
[02:26] the best time I ever had in the
[02:28] parliament uh because for the first time
[02:30] I can really do what I want to do I can
[02:32] set the topics I want to push forward in
[02:34] the parliament um when you're me party
[02:37] member you're always dependent on your
[02:39] party and you always have to do what
[02:41] your party tells you to do and um to be
[02:44] able to to say what I really want to say
[02:46] and to vote like I really want to vote
[02:48] is is uh valuable it's it's not common
[02:52] in the German Parliament that you able
[02:54] to do that as a member of parliament
[02:56] you're always dependent on your party
[02:58] and at the moment we have a big
[03:00] Coalition from the the red party the the
[03:03] the social party the green party and the
[03:05] liberal party and they collapsed they
[03:08] couldn't work together anymore and they
[03:10] collapsed the same week like Trump was
[03:12] elected in the United States so it was a
[03:14] great week uh for for conservatives and
[03:18] liberals in Germany to see um see these
[03:21] development that everything starting new
[03:23] in 20125 and I'm really curious how the
[03:26] the the year will fall down that's super
[03:29] interesting uh it's it's for me always
[03:32] the question like why do we even have
[03:34] the the party system in the first place
[03:36] why why not just like uh everyone that
[03:39] wants to be voted in uh is is written
[03:41] down on one list and then everyone is
[03:43] voted for is is that something that just
[03:45] wouldn't work or like why do we even
[03:47] have that party system in the first
[03:49] place um I think if everybody is on the
[03:51] list it would be very complicated but
[03:53] our party system we have right now in
[03:55] Germany is not the solution it's the
[03:57] problem I think we have to re think our
[04:00] our political system in Germany because
[04:02] it's not working anymore we don't have
[04:04] the Democracy which is promised to us in
[04:07] our constitution because it doesn't
[04:08] matter who you vote for you vote for
[04:10] conservatives for sure you get the
[04:12] social party or the red party or the
[04:14] green party with it you vote for for a
[04:17] rightwing party there's no chance that
[04:19] the rightwing party will be a member of
[04:22] the the government in in 2025 even 20 or
[04:25] 25% say we want to have that so um we
[04:29] really have a problem and we're not able
[04:31] to elect people because the party um has
[04:35] lists of people they already reelected
[04:37] and said these are the people you can
[04:39] elect and if you want to have someone
[04:41] else you have no chance to do that or if
[04:43] you don't want to vote for one of these
[04:45] guys you have no chance to get rid of
[04:46] him so I think we really have to to
[04:49] rethink our political system we have to
[04:51] rethink how we get the money out of the
[04:53] political system I think that's a huge
[04:55] problem also in the US I mean seeing how
[04:57] many millions you have to invest uh just
[05:00] to be able to run for presidency is
[05:02] crazy I I mean let's think about it that
[05:05] only really rich people and only people
[05:07] who have access to real rich people can
[05:10] get be elected as as president of the
[05:11] United States it's it's not okay yeah I
[05:15] mean I think that's one thing maybe that
[05:17] is even better in in Austria and Germany
[05:20] where we at least have more than two
[05:22] parties like we at least have like a
[05:24] little bit more options between those
[05:26] those parties even though some parties
[05:28] are um kind of overlapping in in in in
[05:32] content wise uh but in America it's even
[05:35] crazier you just have like basically two
[05:37] parties and you either get one party or
[05:39] the other party and then you sometimes
[05:41] get grit loocks because the one is in
[05:42] the house and the one is in the Senate
[05:44] where it's total uh chaos uh as at least
[05:48] as I see it uh but on the other hand um
[05:52] you you at least get the politics you
[05:55] elected you voted for when you say okay
[05:57] the the Republicans win then you have a
[06:00] Republican president in Germany when you
[06:03] say okay we have a conservative um
[06:08] Chancellor won the election you still
[06:11] might get a leftwing
[06:13] government something the people didn't
[06:15] vote for just because of the coalitions
[06:17] they have to form so um somehow it's not
[06:21] working anymore and if you have parties
[06:23] uh which uh are not part of the of the
[06:26] political system because uh the other
[06:29] parties don't want to work with them
[06:31] even though the uh the people vote for
[06:33] them it's it's it's not working anymore
[06:36] so Germany is isn't the left-wing
[06:38] country anymore that we have more
[06:41] conservatives and liberals in Germany
[06:43] now than we had four years ago and for
[06:46] sure we won't get a conservative liberal
[06:48] government in 2025 it's not going to
[06:51] happen we know that already so how is
[06:52] that democracy inter it's kind of the
[06:56] same thing that is now happening uh in
[06:58] Austria where we have a clear winner in
[07:01] in in the election and no nobody wants
[07:04] to collaborate exactly how is that
[07:07] democracy you have a clear winner of the
[07:09] election who is not going to rule the
[07:11] country I mean you don't you don't have
[07:14] to like them but that's democracy you
[07:16] have to to accept the vote of the people
[07:18] and if you don't do that you really have
[07:20] a a real problem and and the crazy thing
[07:23] in austa I mean it's very small country
[07:25] for for Americans but uh the crazy thing
[07:28] the the party that one is already in
[07:31] four of the nine districts in Austria
[07:33] already in the government and will
[07:35] become now in the fifth uh District in
[07:38] also become in the government but they
[07:41] just say like oh oh on on the national
[07:43] level in Austria that's not possible but
[07:45] on all the district level there it's
[07:47] possible because yeah there's no reason
[07:49] for because but yeah that's that's kind
[07:52] of politics and I think that's why
[07:54] people are really upset with politics
[07:56] right now I don't know if it's
[07:58] everywhere in the world probably El
[07:59] Salvador not because I was there and
[08:01] people really uh uh like nukul it seems
[08:05] like uh but in Austria and Germany in
[08:07] Europe I guess there's really a big uh
[08:10] dissatisfaction with with the
[08:12] governments and with politicians in
[08:13] general yeah I mean we have the problem
[08:15] in all the Western countries to be
[08:17] honest um I'm at a lot of conferences
[08:20] and every time I talk to people from the
[08:22] states the UK France Australia Germany
[08:26] we all have the same problems and and we
[08:28] all have to think about how can we
[08:29] change that I'm really curious about the
[08:31] United States now having Trump and his
[08:34] team in office um from January on
[08:37] because he promises some change and the
[08:41] the people he elected in his in his team
[08:44] promises a lot of change so I hope they
[08:47] keep them um I hope they follow through
[08:50] and then we maybe see some changes in
[08:53] the western world because we always
[08:54] follow the United States it's crazy it
[08:57] doesn't matter what the United States
[08:58] does in a couple of years Germany and
[09:01] all the European countries will follow
[09:02] we took the the vot virus into into
[09:06] European union and and Germany and if if
[09:08] Trump's going to change that I'm sure we
[09:10] we're going to adapt and that's where
[09:12] we're coming to bitcoin and and seeing
[09:14] all the plans Trump and his team have
[09:16] for Bitcoin it's I'm sure Europe will
[09:19] follow a couple of years later it will
[09:22] be way more expensive for us now than it
[09:24] will be for the United States if they
[09:26] follow through but we will follow so we
[09:28] will see and as you mentioned bua is
[09:31] doing something different um mle in
[09:34] Argentina is doing something different
[09:35] and he seems to be very
[09:37] successful um promoting freedom for the
[09:40] people instead of the big government
[09:42] instead of the big state so fingers
[09:44] crossed that all these people are
[09:46] successful and uh Europe will
[09:48] follow why is it like that like why is
[09:52] Europe following and I saw the same
[09:54] Trend like it's definitely something
[09:56] that's uh
[09:58] undeniable undeniably true but why is it
[10:01] that Europe seems to be lagging a few
[10:03] years behind America and America is kind
[10:05] of leading the way positively and
[10:08] negatively I have no idea to be honest I
[10:10] don't know why we can't be the first for
[10:13] for some change I mean having Bitcoin
[10:16] now as a topic and seeing the
[10:17] possibilities and and seeing the chances
[10:20] and seeing that elav Vador is doing it
[10:22] already and the United States says we
[10:25] are going to start and have a Bitcoin
[10:27] reserve and we see China and Russia now
[10:29] waking up again um why don't we take the
[10:32] lead in the in Europe I don't get it why
[10:34] are we so scared and always waiting for
[10:36] other people to do something and then we
[10:38] see oh it's working out now we can adapt
[10:40] it why aren't we are the one who say
[10:43] okay we don't see the risk first but the
[10:44] chances and we take the chances I don't
[10:46] know if why we are so fearful in in in
[10:49] Europe especially in German I mean
[10:51] German angst is something you hear all
[10:55] over the world because we are always
[10:57] afraid of of new things instead of
[10:59] seeing the chances and say hey let's try
[11:01] it if it's not working out it's not
[11:03] working out but at least let's try it
[11:06] are you the the only member of the
[11:09] parliament which is openly uh for
[11:12] Bitcoin openly yes as promoting Bitcoin
[11:17] the way I do I'm the only one there are
[11:19] a couple of colleagues who get Bitcoin
[11:22] uh but their party aren't Pro Bitcoin
[11:26] yet so uh they're fearful about speaking
[11:29] out I mean we had a lot of events in the
[11:31] German bundist with my initiative
[11:33] Bitcoin in the German Parliament where I
[11:36] invited a lot of Bitcoin experts um to
[11:39] talk to my fellow MPS and to their
[11:41] employees about Bitcoin and educate them
[11:44] about Bitcoin because you only can make
[11:46] good decisions when you're informed um
[11:49] and we had uh a lot of MPS sending their
[11:52] employees there so they are not the the
[11:56] the people who go there by themselves
[11:58] and we have had employees registering
[12:01] with their private email addresses so
[12:03] that we can couldn't follow through
[12:05] where which party they belong so when
[12:08] sometimes I knew the people and said
[12:09] okay they're the liberals or they're
[12:11] from the green party um but they're
[12:13] still afraid of of openly promoting
[12:16] Bitcoin and that's something I really
[12:18] don't get I mean but also you see how
[12:21] how what problem we have with the party
[12:23] system if party members are not uh are
[12:27] not courage courageous enough to say hey
[12:29] I'm from Bitcoin
[12:31] openly so we we kind of have to wait
[12:33] till one party says hey we we want to
[12:36] make Bitcoin platform I heard uh I'm not
[12:40] very deep in into German uh German
[12:42] politics but I heard that afd is
[12:44] actually looking into being the the most
[12:48] bullish on bitcoin the pro Bitcoin party
[12:50] for the next election which is coming up
[12:52] in like two two months basically yeah
[12:56] yeah that's that's a funny thing because
[12:57] the afd was my party I the afd two years
[13:00] ago and I tried to push Bitcoin in the
[13:03] afd for a year um I I had a bill
[13:08] prepared which we could bring into
[13:10] Parliament and I really tried hard in
[13:13] the part to say this is a topic this is
[13:15] important let's do it and they didn't
[13:16] want to do it um they weren't Pro
[13:19] Bitcoin they were very skeptical they're
[13:20] very skeptical about all new
[13:23] digitalization invention um because
[13:26] they're also conservatives and and
[13:28] pretty scared of that
[13:29] and um then I left the party and said
[13:31] okay I'm I'm going to push it now as an
[13:34] independent and now they realize seeing
[13:37] Trump uh and the election the United
[13:40] States that's it's really something
[13:42] which is important to people and which
[13:45] can generate voters and now they're
[13:47] saying okay let's do it let's let's take
[13:49] it and make it a topic but only in the
[13:52] way to say we don't want any regulations
[13:54] for for cryptocurrencies for Bitcoin um
[13:57] it's not like they have their own ideas
[13:59] what they can do to push Bitcoin forward
[14:02] or to implement it in our Energy System
[14:05] like Bitcoin mining or something it's
[14:06] like just leave it alone that's their
[14:08] position but at least there is a party
[14:10] now in Germany which is taking on the
[14:12] topic and I'm talking to some other
[14:14] colleagues from other parties to say
[14:16] look it's going to be a topic it's not
[14:19] going away so um if you if you don't
[14:22] address it in uh during the election and
[14:26] you will have a problem yeah uh n yilin
[14:29] in Austria made that work where uh I
[14:32] think he I think he only reported it
[14:35] someone else actually asked the parties
[14:37] all the um um members of the all the
[14:41] parties of the Austrian Parliament was
[14:44] were asked about Bitcoin and what their
[14:46] position is and most of the parties was
[14:48] just like yeah
[14:51] like um are going to say in English it's
[14:54] just like
[14:56] um it's it's something that is like um
[14:59] how can I say it I forgot the word but
[15:02] it's nothing really a position it's just
[15:04] like yeah it's Innovation or oh we we
[15:06] see it very critical because of taxes we
[15:09] see it very critical because of energy
[15:11] consumption like they didn't bring up
[15:13] anything uh of of substance uh how how
[15:17] are the positions right now of the
[15:20] German um um politic parties are there
[15:24] any real positions are there any where
[15:27] they like oh there's actually a there or
[15:29] is this just like in Austria and
[15:32] unfortunately the people who talk about
[15:35] Bitcoin most of them are negative in in
[15:37] the German Parliament the same things
[15:39] you just mentioned it's like it's a
[15:41] climate killer it's used by terrorists
[15:43] it's used for money laundry and we had
[15:46] the um the CDU uh it's the biggest
[15:48] conservative party we have in Germany
[15:50] issuing a bill last year um to uh forbid
[15:56] or to ban changing Bitcoin into Europe
[15:59] in Germany so basically ban Bitcoin in
[16:02] Germany so that you can't use it anymore
[16:04] that was the biggest party in Germany
[16:05] which will be which will have the next
[16:08] Chancellor in in Germany for sure so
[16:11] it's very important then the German
[16:12] bitcoiners wake up and talk to these
[16:15] politicians and tell them what a bad
[16:18] idea that is um to be against Bitcoin so
[16:21] they only think about how can we
[16:23] regulate it can we ban it how hard can
[16:25] we make it uh to use Bitcoin because uh
[16:29] um the people who really look into it
[16:30] it's like yeah it's a Danger let's see
[16:33] if we can limit the the use of Bitcoin
[16:37] um what they don't get it's it's not
[16:39] going anywhere and they can't ban it the
[16:41] people will still use it what they don't
[16:44] know and what I'm trying to push on them
[16:46] is how important Bitcoin is for human
[16:48] rights organization for the third world
[16:50] country for the developing countries um
[16:53] that's human rights foundations aren't
[16:55] able to to uh use just normal currency
[16:58] they if you are active in Russia or in
[17:01] other countries you will have your your
[17:03] accounts closed you not able to collect
[17:05] any money for your cost so they're using
[17:07] Bitcoin navali was using Bitcoin Assange
[17:10] was using Bitcoin um so that's something
[17:12] the politicians need to know and that's
[17:14] something I always tell them it's like
[17:16] if you make it hard to use Bitcoin you
[17:19] make it hard for for human rights uh
[17:21] foundations and organizations to fund
[17:24] themselves it's super interesting
[17:26] especially uh as as you uh see me the
[17:29] only one in in Germany that did not only
[17:33] discover Bitcoin but also got the
[17:34] courage and the conviction to actually
[17:36] speak up about it and make it a real big
[17:38] issue um how did you discover that and
[17:41] how did you get that big conviction for
[17:44] Bitcoin uh it was still in the time
[17:46] where you were with the afd I presume it
[17:50] was before my well when I started BFD
[17:53] but it was 2013 when my brother told me
[17:56] hey there is this thing called Bitcoin
[17:58] if you have any money left you don't
[17:59] need uh invest it um it can might be
[18:03] that you lose everything it might be
[18:05] that it is a big thing unfortunately I
[18:08] didn't listen to him he invested a lot I
[18:11] didn't um but I rediscovered Bitcoin a
[18:14] couple of years later I don't know I
[18:15] think it was 2017 or 18 something
[18:18] because um I'm in politics to fight for
[18:22] Freedom that is my my mission in in
[18:25] politics because I saw Freedom declining
[18:28] in Germany and I'm born in Romania uh I
[18:31] know what it is to live in a country
[18:33] where there is no Freedom where you live
[18:35] under dictatorship and I saw so many
[18:38] developments in Germany which were like
[18:40] whoa careful yeah we know that from
[18:43] other countries like if you're not able
[18:45] to speak up if you're not allowed to
[18:47] speak your mind if there's no freedom of
[18:49] speech we have a problem in a democracy
[18:52] and and that's why I went into politics
[18:54] and also because I knew that the money
[18:56] system is broken I knew that printing
[18:58] money is one of the biggest problem we
[19:00] have in the world um and then I watched
[19:03] a video on YouTube about the Austin
[19:05] School of Economics combining it with
[19:08] Bitcoin and there was the solution I was
[19:11] looking for I didn't have the solution
[19:12] for the problems we have and suddenly
[19:14] there it was and it was like an instant
[19:17] light bulb in my head it's like that's
[19:19] it and it's even better than I thought
[19:21] it could be because of all the the
[19:23] benefits which come with it with
[19:25] personal freedom with taking the power
[19:27] away from the bank taking the power away
[19:29] from the government claim reclaiming
[19:31] sovereignity for for the people um so
[19:35] that was it when I said that's important
[19:37] let's push it and as I told you I wasn't
[19:39] able to do that in within my own party
[19:41] and I did it as soon as I was out of the
[19:43] party and an
[19:45] independent interesting is is for you
[19:48] Bitcoin now the most important Freedom
[19:52] issue that that that we
[19:54] have yeah yeah I think it's one of the
[19:58] tools we really have um to take the
[20:01] power away from the people who who don't
[20:04] have something good in mind for for
[20:07] their country or for us who who really
[20:10] are only about how can we keep our power
[20:13] how can we keep the money and now how
[20:15] can we not how we can bring our own
[20:17] country forward it's like when you
[20:19] listen to Donald Trump who says America
[20:21] First you don't hear that in Germany or
[20:23] in in other countries it's like they're
[20:26] not looking after their people anymore
[20:28] and being able to say okay we have now
[20:30] the sovereignity we have our own Freedom
[20:32] currency that the government can't take
[20:34] away from us that they can't sensor that
[20:37] they can't inflate they can't steal the
[20:39] money from us anymore like they do with
[20:41] the with the Euro or with the dollar
[20:43] with the inflation that's that's really
[20:46] powerful and um seeing governments not
[20:50] being able to stop it is is very
[20:52] powerful I mean just look at what
[20:53] happened in Canada with the with the
[20:55] truck drivers um who uh uh during covid
[21:00] uh demonstrated against the the vaccine
[21:04] um mandatory I think it's the right word
[21:06] in English and um tro cut them off they
[21:10] were not able to get any money they they
[21:13] had their bank accounts suspended they
[21:14] had the PayPal Mastercard everything was
[21:18] shut down so that they couldn't get um
[21:21] any money and then they people who
[21:23] wanted to to give them some money uh
[21:25] switch to bitcoin and Canadian
[21:28] government couldn't do anything about it
[21:30] that's where you see that that the
[21:32] people can get their power back that's
[21:35] in interesting and when we look at
[21:38] Germany I think especially people
[21:40] outside of of of Europe they got to know
[21:44] Germany at least this year when they
[21:47] sold the 50,000 Bitcoin I think that
[21:50] that's where Germany got got famous in
[21:53] the last couple of of of months now uh
[21:57] which is also really interesting when we
[22:00] see America now having around 200,000
[22:03] Bitcoin still confiscated not bought so
[22:06] uh lot of people say they don't really
[22:07] have it because it's not their Bitcoin
[22:10] but they still have it uh the same thing
[22:13] with Germany they had the 50,000 Bitcoin
[22:15] um from from a law perspective from a
[22:17] political uh perspective was the option
[22:20] of not selling those 50,000 Bitcoin even
[22:24] there on the table is that even
[22:26] something that they could have done or
[22:28] they were forced to to sell
[22:30] those um well it wasn't really Germany
[22:33] it was a part of Germany it was Saxony
[22:36] who who confiscated the Bitcoin um and
[22:39] they did so in January and they sold in
[22:42] summer so they had six months about of
[22:46] thinking about what are we going to do
[22:48] with Bitcoin with this Bitcoin and yes
[22:50] we have a law in Germany which says if
[22:52] you claim something and confiscate
[22:55] something which is in danger to lose
[22:57] value cast um over the next couple of
[23:01] months you have to sell them so if you
[23:03] now um have a like merious or something
[23:07] and and you claim that as as a country
[23:08] you have to sell its past because the
[23:10] Mercedes won't be that valuable in five
[23:12] years like it is now well Bitcoin is not
[23:16] that kind of thing it's not going to
[23:18] lose value so um they had really had
[23:21] time the politicians had time a have a
[23:23] year to think about what are we going to
[23:25] do with this are do we have to change
[23:27] the law can we just take Bitcoin off is
[23:30] Bitcoin even a part of this or can we
[23:31] say Bitcoin doesn't belong to this
[23:33] category of things you have to sell fast
[23:36] but they didn't do anything of it I mean
[23:38] I wrote a letter to the chancellor to
[23:40] the chancellor Schultz I wrote a letter
[23:42] to our finance minister I wrote a letter
[23:44] to the minister of Saxony and told them
[23:46] stop it stop it use these Bitcoin as a
[23:49] start of of of a of a reserve currency
[23:53] for for for Germany and I didn't even
[23:56] get an answer and so they sold and if
[23:59] you looked at the the nearly 100,000 the
[24:02] all-time high we had in in Bitcoin a
[24:05] couple of weeks ago um they would have
[24:07] made two billion euros more when they
[24:10] sold then talking about losing value
[24:13] fast it's it's crazy and I don't see
[24:16] anything or any politicians thinking
[24:19] about changing the law now so when it
[24:21] happens again that they don't make the
[24:23] same mistake again it's like still there
[24:27] so if they if they do it again they
[24:29] again have to sell it it's crazy but now
[24:32] I saw that that the Americans are also
[24:36] um moving their Bitcoins now to some
[24:38] wallets I don't know if this is the
[24:39] Biden Administration trying to get rid
[24:41] of Bitcoin before Trump takes over uh I
[24:44] mean crazy crazy if they also start to
[24:46] sell now yeah the I I think uh uh some
[24:51] move to coin base but I don't know if
[24:53] it's confirmed that you already sold it
[24:55] I I just saw the news that uh I think
[24:58] moved it yeah that's that's the news I
[25:00] also saw yeah super interesting yeah uh
[25:03] the president wants to get in the way of
[25:05] the next president but I guess this were
[25:08] always some games played uh but it's
[25:11] it's just like a month till till Trump
[25:13] takes over uh and maybe maybe if they
[25:16] sell a lot of Bitcoin maybe he he signs
[25:19] some papers of like yeah let's let's buy
[25:21] Bitcoin now this was interesting um I
[25:24] thought about that because America is
[25:26] now pushing that strategic Reserve they
[25:28] have a bill from the C lumus uh and I
[25:32] thought about it I was like why would
[25:34] they announce that bill let it through
[25:36] Senate through house let time pass and
[25:39] to that so that everyone knows that
[25:41] America is buying Bitcoin and then buy
[25:44] it uh why would not Trump just sign some
[25:48] executive order and and buy it uh
[25:51] directly is that a possibility do you
[25:53] know or what do you expect of uh America
[25:57] once actually gets elected especially
[26:00] they don't have a gridlock probably they
[26:02] have the house and the Senate so it
[26:04] seems like they they can do a lot of
[26:06] things a lot of change in America now
[26:09] yeah um I'm not sure I mean of course
[26:12] they wanted to be elected so that's why
[26:15] they pushed the topic of Bitcoin forward
[26:17] I think but after the election I also
[26:20] would stay quiet now so that the price
[26:23] is not going up if I really want to buy
[26:25] so just be quiet and then just buy and
[26:27] all other countries are like whoa what's
[26:29] happening now um I don't think Trump
[26:33] gets Bitcoin to be honest I mean I
[26:35] listen to his speeches he's always
[26:37] talking about cryptocurrency and
[26:38] everything and I don't think he he
[26:40] really got it but he he got that it's an
[26:42] important topic but he has very good
[26:44] people on his team Bitcoin was on his
[26:46] team a couple of them I met um at at
[26:49] Bitcoin conferences and I'm pretty sure
[26:52] they will push him forward to to really
[26:55] keep up with his promises and and start
[26:57] um making a Bitcoin Reserve now in in
[27:00] the United States with the Bitcoins they
[27:01] already have and um yeah push the topic
[27:06] forward I mean I'm I'm really curious
[27:07] about the energy sectors about Bitcoin
[27:10] mining what what they doing there um
[27:12] because Trump promised to say okay let's
[27:14] let's make America the the
[27:17] cryptocurrency country so make sure we
[27:19] have enough energy for Bitcoin mining
[27:20] and everything I'm really curious what
[27:22] they're doing a different kind of of uh
[27:25] political topics now absolutely yeah
[27:28] Bitcoin mining is also something really
[27:30] interesting that I want to get to but
[27:32] first um what are your thoughts in
[27:34] general of of of Game Theory we have
[27:36] really small countries like Budan uh
[27:40] adopting Bitcoin very aggressively but
[27:41] it's basically a smaller city in Germany
[27:45] from from the size then we have El
[27:47] Salvador which is a little bit smaller
[27:49] than than Austria from the population
[27:51] size which is pushing it uh
[27:53] aggressively uh which is important uh
[27:57] but it's not
[27:58] America the force that um the European
[28:02] Union uh China or America or one of the
[28:05] bigger forces or Russia has it's not
[28:08] compared to what Salvador has uh so with
[28:12] America now even just talking about that
[28:15] uh no matter like when they actually do
[28:17] it uh what what is what are the thoughts
[28:20] what are your thoughts around Game
[28:22] Theory when America is pushing that and
[28:25] I heard the UAE is also um really really
[28:29] uh pushing forwards I think they have
[28:31] with some statistics the highest
[28:32] adoption rate when it comes to what what
[28:35] the population already has on on bitcoin
[28:38] uh how do you think about that also with
[28:40] like us Europe UAE China I think we
[28:43] Europe will follow um I think it will
[28:46] take some time in Europe because it's
[28:48] Trump doing it and with all our
[28:51] governments um we have in the European
[28:53] Union and the European Union itself they
[28:56] hate him they really hate him with all
[28:58] they have so seeing that it's Trump
[29:02] pushing Bitcoin forward now um I think
[29:04] they will say okay if he's doing that
[29:06] we're not going to do that uh that's
[29:09] will be the initial thought because
[29:10] everything Trump does is is not good in
[29:14] in the eyes of our politicians right now
[29:17] but um I think over time they will get
[29:20] formal if they see that it's playing out
[29:22] successful uh they will they will follow
[29:25] for sure um and I
[29:28] to see that countries like the the the
[29:32] UE or or China or Russia are now waking
[29:35] up or waking up again because China was
[29:38] as it they just tried to ban it
[29:41] um I think we we should be worried about
[29:44] that if if they are the first to say
[29:46] okay we're going to to push that forward
[29:49] and and and um buy a lot of Bitcoin or
[29:51] mine a lot of Bitcoin as as Democrat
[29:55] Democratic countries we have in in the
[29:56] European Union we should be be one of
[29:58] the first to to do that and and not
[30:00] leave these countries to to lead the way
[30:03] in my opinion um but as I said with
[30:07] trump it will be a little bit difficult
[30:09] because uh the way we see him now and uh
[30:13] but they will don't they don't have any
[30:15] chance they will have to follow there's
[30:16] there's no chance around it I partnered

[32:31] about that before we restarted recording
[32:33] what what uh individuals can do to to
[32:35] make change and to push polit politics I
[32:38] think that's really an important uh
[32:41] topic so for the people that are
[32:42] listening no matter if they are sitting
[32:44] in America or in in Europe somewhere uh
[32:48] what should they do or what can they do
[32:50] to to push uh the regulations in in the
[32:53] right direction yeah I always when I
[32:56] talk to bitcoiners they always tell me
[32:58] uh I didn't vote for years I don't care
[33:00] about politics um leave me alone with
[33:03] all this I'm I have Bitcoin I don't
[33:07] need it uh I understand it being in
[33:10] politics for over 11 years now and in
[33:12] Parliament for seven years now I totally
[33:14] get why people are fed up with
[33:16] politicians and fed up with politics but
[33:19] and here's the big but you have to be
[33:22] involved you have to get active because
[33:25] otherwise politicians won't change their
[33:27] mind and especially in Europe they will
[33:30] go on with this course of how can we
[33:33] really regulate Bitcoin and make it hard
[33:36] to use for the people and when they
[33:39] realize that there are voters out there
[33:42] who are giving their vote politicians
[33:44] who are pro Bitcoin they will start
[33:46] thinking about it I see it now in
[33:48] Germany we have a lot of bitcoiners we
[33:50] have a huge Bitcoin community in Germany
[33:52] and they're starting to contact uh their
[33:55] MPS and and making a M ments with them
[33:58] and go there and tell them hey what's
[34:00] your stand on bitcoin what's your
[34:02] opinion what are you going to do and if
[34:04] the politicians said I have no idea I
[34:06] never looked into Bitcoin they tell them
[34:08] no problem I come back in four weeks
[34:10] then you tell me so
[34:13] having really having this um to push the
[34:16] the the the the politicians to to be
[34:19] forced to look into Bitcoin and to see
[34:23] what Bitcoin is really about is
[34:25] something which is really necessary
[34:27] because because when we are in the
[34:29] parliament we have to make so many
[34:30] decisions we are voting on so many
[34:32] things it is not possible for a
[34:35] politicians to know everything and to to
[34:39] Really
[34:40] um to really get what we are voting
[34:43] about we are specialized in our topics
[34:46] like I'm a person responsible for for
[34:49] digital politics in Germany I don't know
[34:52] when there's something coming from from
[34:54] the nature department or from the
[34:56] financial district the new tax law I
[34:58] don't know the details about it so I'm
[35:00] dependent on the colleagues what they're
[35:02] telling me and when all the colleagues
[35:04] in in the parties tell them well Bitcoin
[35:05] is bad then most of the people most of
[35:08] the colleagues in in this party will
[35:10] follow except if they know about Bitcoin
[35:14] themselves and when the party leader is
[35:16] telling them no we're going to reject
[35:18] Bitcoin and we're going to regulate it
[35:19] to death when these party members speak
[35:22] up this small orange group of people in
[35:24] in all the country in all the parties
[35:26] speak up and say no let's talk about it
[35:28] that's very helpful so they have to be
[35:31] informed in order to be informed they
[35:33] they have need people to go walk up to
[35:35] them and tell them it's a topic and
[35:37] that's us that's the voters what what
[35:39] they have to do in America it's now a
[35:41] little bit easier with with the Trump
[35:43] Administration and Republicans Pro
[35:45] Bitcoin um but still talk to the
[35:48] politicians still tell them it's it's
[35:51] really a topic which is important
[35:53] educate them about not only um that
[35:57] that's it's good for for wealth grow but
[36:00] how Bitcoin mining is important how it
[36:02] is important for for other countries
[36:03] Bitcoin how we can use it in different
[36:05] kind of ways um educate them because
[36:08] politicians don't know everything to be
[36:11] honest they don't they they know just a
[36:14] little bit but they think they know a
[36:16] lot so just just talk to them be active
[36:19] absolutely and uh we there's a public
[36:22] popular saying in Bitcoin is like
[36:24] Bitcoin doesn't care about politics but
[36:26] the important thing here is politics
[36:29] cares about you and you are still with
[36:31] your like no matter how many Bitcoin you
[36:34] have you are still with your physical
[36:36] body in in a jurisdiction uh where they
[36:39] have um certain rights over you so
[36:43] that's why you from a just from a normal
[36:46] standpoint from your own incentive you
[36:48] should care about politics and at least
[36:50] observe it carefully to see in what
[36:53] direction it goes and if you want to
[36:54] make a difference uh you have to speak
[36:57] with your representatives with your
[36:59] Parliament members and so on even on on
[37:02] a regional level on a national level on
[37:05] maybe even on an EU level uh um there's
[37:08] also representatives there so that's
[37:10] something really important uh and I was
[37:13] even in politics in Austria uh before I
[37:16] got into Bitcoin then with Bitcoin I got
[37:18] out of politics and now I starting to
[37:20] get back in a little bit because I see
[37:22] the importance of uh being there as a
[37:25] bitcoiner in the politics SE action uh
[37:28] and this is really something that is
[37:30] extremely important uh that we do and we
[37:33] should not hide like of course we can be
[37:36] like the the shadowy bitcoiner that
[37:39] hides and is completely private and is
[37:41] is hiding from the state but that's a Al
[37:43] I don't want to
[37:44] live I don't want to fear that the
[37:47] government is doing something for me
[37:49] yeah and it's also a little bit selfish
[37:53] if you say okay I have my Bitcoin I'm
[37:55] fine I know how to use Bitcoin even if
[37:57] my country is Banning Bitcoin I still
[37:59] going to use it I don't care what the
[38:01] country the government is say we want a
[38:04] lot of people use Bitcoin we want to
[38:07] have the masses using Bitcoin because
[38:09] it's good for them and um if a country
[38:13] or the government makes it really hard
[38:15] for people to use Bitcoin because of the
[38:18] regulations or if they make it legal and
[38:20] you have to do it illegally um there are
[38:23] a lot of people out there who will be
[38:24] scared to use it they will make it hard
[38:27] for the majority of people to use
[38:28] Bitcoin so it's on on the bitcoiners who
[38:32] really get it um to prevent that and to
[38:34] make it possible for for all these
[38:36] people who have no idea how to use
[38:38] Bitcoin but they want to use it and um
[38:41] to really advocate for them and make
[38:43] their life easier if you want to have
[38:44] Bitcoin in a broad adaption in Bitcoin
[38:47] in the world and not only for for a few
[38:49] absolutely and there are also there
[38:52] there's this um making a difference uh
[38:55] with speaking to politicians and making
[38:56] a difference with your vote but then
[38:59] there's also something uh different that
[39:01] is popular uh that I've seen now some uh
[39:05] bitcoiners in Germany have done I
[39:07] actually don't know any Austrian piters
[39:10] that have done it but yeah Austrian is
[39:12] way smaller also uh that they vote with
[39:15] their feed so they they leave the
[39:17] country um we have popular um examples
[39:21] with Lena s but she's gone for a long
[39:24] time already she's always on the Move
[39:26] then there's like from Bitcoin hotel and
[39:29] there's a bunch of uh smaller ones and a
[39:32] bunch of other ones I even was in El
[39:33] Salvador and they they have a a house
[39:36] there with like I don't know 20 Germans
[39:39] from uh from Germany that all left to to
[39:41] Salvador um is that is that something
[39:45] that the government is even noticing is
[39:47] that something that uh the governments
[39:49] and the politicians are even aware of uh
[39:53] who's leaving the country and who's
[39:55] probably who's entering the country they
[39:56] are more aware of but who who's leaving
[39:58] the
[39:59] country um they they they can't be not
[40:02] aware of it because um I think the last
[40:05] number I read is like a quarter of a
[40:07] million Germans leaving Germany every
[40:09] year and they are mostly the young
[40:12] people the well educated people because
[40:14] they say look look at Germany you have
[40:17] to pay absurd taxes we have a
[40:19] bureaucracy which is absolutely crazy um
[40:22] it's going downhill fast all our
[40:25] industry is shutting down look at the uh
[40:27] um car industry what they done to the
[40:29] car industry with the politics we have
[40:31] right now so they're leaving because
[40:33] they don't see any chances in Germany
[40:35] getting back on its feet um to be honest
[40:39] I in my um circle of of friends and
[40:42] people I don't know anyone without a
[40:44] plan B they all way all have a plan B
[40:48] where are we going to go if this is if
[40:51] Germany is just failing um there is of
[40:54] course Elsa Vador there is the United
[40:56] States Thailand Bulgaria Hungary the
[40:58] people are going away it's like we're
[41:01] fed up and if the next government
[41:03] doesn't change anything it will for
[41:05] certain be get worse and I myself I'm
[41:09] not going to get old in Germany if
[41:12] Germany stays the same I'm going to
[41:14] leave the country it's like I I fought
[41:16] for this country like 11 years in
[41:18] politics I did everything I could um but
[41:22] this if this socialist course is
[41:24] continuing I'm not going to stay here
[41:27] and all of my friends are not going to
[41:28] stay here and that's is something the
[41:31] that the German government needs to know
[41:33] and the people who are in power um it's
[41:37] like they exchanging their their their
[41:39] people is we have millions of people
[41:41] coming to Germany from seeking Asel in
[41:44] Germany and and the Val educated are all
[41:47] leaving Germany that's not that's not
[41:48] working out it's not going to work out
[41:51] and um I mean look at El Salvador what
[41:54] the kill is doing what he's offering for
[41:56] people how easy it is for people to go
[41:58] to El Salvador and build something up
[42:00] and create something new and what kind
[42:02] of people are moving there now that's
[42:04] the way to do it that's the what mle is
[42:07] doing in Argentina now deregulate
[42:09] everything getting the freedom back make
[42:12] it possible for for people to open their
[42:14] businesses make it easy for people
[42:16] that's the way to do it and at the
[42:18] moment the European Union is going
[42:20] directly the opposite way I tried to
[42:22] open a company in Germany it took me
[42:24] over half a year now and I still don't
[42:26] have my my number from the from the
[42:29] finance institutes which I need to to
[42:32] issue bills it's crazy it's totally
[42:34] crazy I mean if you do it in the United
[42:37] States I think you're able to do it
[42:38] within a day online and in Germany you
[42:42] it's like yeah well that but that's why
[42:45] why people are are leaving and also
[42:46] because of the taxes the the price of
[42:49] living here is is getting absurdly
[42:52] expensive wow I didn't knew that that it
[42:54] takes so long in in Germany uh I did the
[42:57] same thing obviously with my podcast I
[42:59] had to do it with in Austria and it was
[43:02] quite easy I got everything done and I
[43:06] got my vet number also within I think a
[43:09] month uh it's it's still long uh but
[43:12] like under month I think it's it's
[43:15] reasonable at least understandable but a
[43:17] half a year that's that seems very long
[43:20] to wait because always all of the sudden
[43:22] you need those numbers to to make the
[43:24] bills and invoices I mean if it was hard
[43:27] for me to get an account for my business
[43:30] because a lot of banks said no um and
[43:34] and it's like okay if I can't open the
[43:36] bank account how can I open the business
[43:39] and wait they they they didn't let you
[43:41] open a bank account no they didn't let
[43:43] me open the bank accounts I think I had
[43:45] over 10 banks in Germany telling me no
[43:48] you're not able to open the business
[43:49] account with us and actually I now have
[43:52] a business account with a French uh Bank
[43:55] operating online bank operating in
[43:57] Germany now but I mean that's why I'm
[44:01] back to bitcoin then it's not possible
[44:03] to say no well you're not allowed to use
[44:05] it it's um having this Bank issues in
[44:09] Germany now is pretty common because you
[44:11] have um party members of the afd who get
[44:14] elected now into not into the German
[44:17] Parliament but in the county parliaments
[44:19] and they got their bank accounts
[44:21] canceled because in the view of their
[44:24] Banks they have the wrong political view
[44:26] so they can their bank accounts and
[44:29] that's where I said remember I talked
[44:31] about Bitcoin three years ago so maybe
[44:34] you should look into it because it's not
[44:35] possible to do that with but that's how
[44:38] Germany's is operating right now if you
[44:40] have the wrong political opinion you
[44:43] don't get your bank account that's crazy
[44:46] I mean that that are paying customers
[44:48] why would you say no to that like even
[44:50] if you disagree on a political level if
[44:53] if they don't harm people uh like like
[44:56] money should be completely neutral in my
[44:58] opinion money shouldn't care about
[45:00] anything you do or stand for that that
[45:03] that's how money should be uh so like
[45:05] money I think is something that should
[45:07] be even for the worst people they should
[45:09] even have uh access to to money which is
[45:12] a hard thing uh to to think about even
[45:15] if your worst enemy has has has money
[45:19] and access to that but uh even going
[45:22] there and it's just like a different
[45:24] political VI uh and you just canceling
[45:28] them out of your bank account and you
[45:29] are even disincentivized to do that
[45:32] because you would pay fees for that bank
[45:34] you would be a paying customer they
[45:36] would benefit from having you that's
[45:39] crazy yeah that's but that's the way
[45:42] politics or yeah Germany is is is uh
[45:46] working right now and that's also one of
[45:49] the reasons why people are fed up and uh
[45:52] especially starting to vote for for more
[45:54] radical parties because we said we're
[45:56] fed up with government or just saying
[45:58] okay we're going to leave why should I
[46:00] care about Germany if if they're trying
[46:03] to harm me just because I have the wrong
[46:05] political opinion yeah I think
[46:08] especially younger people are are are
[46:10] way more flexible with the votes and
[46:13] don't vote for the party that they
[46:15] always voted for and they're like hey
[46:16] like let's see what they are offering
[46:18] and let's see what what I I really like
[46:20] and so that's where where you see big
[46:23] shift in Austria and I think I think
[46:26] there will be
[46:27] one hell of a vot in Germany in February
[46:30] I think a lot of people politicians
[46:32] probably will wake up to reality in in
[46:34] February in in in Germany because as you
[46:36] seen um all the polls from the current
[46:40] or the past government now uh they're
[46:43] like at at 30% now or something like
[46:46] that I saw that they have not even like
[46:49] a majority uh of of the votes now which
[46:52] is crazy uh so yeah that's that's is
[46:55] really interesting how it shakes
[46:57] do you think um in Europe in Germany is
[47:01] there any danger of the political uh
[47:05] Powers doing real harm to bitcoin
[47:08] talking about self- custody ban mining
[47:11] ban uh threatening on and off Rams is
[47:14] there any any danger of real harm except
[47:17] of selling Bitcoin and the the not not
[47:19] so bigger harms um there definitely is
[47:22] as I said the party who will have the
[47:25] next Chancellor and who will be in the
[47:27] next government is the party with one of
[47:30] the the bills who will make it very hard
[47:33] for us to use Bitcoin I mean if you not
[47:35] allowed in Germany to change Euro to
[47:37] bitcoin to buy Bitcoin with Euros I mean
[47:40] how are you going to to to do that so
[47:43] it's it's really um they're really on
[47:46] the wrong path right now um and they
[47:50] they always they Alo wanted to to ban
[47:53] the mixers and everything so it's it's
[47:55] going they can do really harmful things
[47:58] to bitcoin and that's why I always tell
[48:01] tell the bitcoiners call their call your
[48:02] in pece talk to them and explain to them
[48:05] why Bitcoin is
[48:07] important um but I mean having the the
[48:11] Trump now and and the the the Republican
[48:15] party uh for the next four years in the
[48:17] United States maybe there is this
[48:20] influen if they say they start that they
[48:23] are not going to be that hard on bitcoin
[48:25] because um they see that they will harm
[48:28] Germany or they will harm themselves um
[48:31] so um that's a little bit of hope I have
[48:34] I I it's crazy to to hope that the
[48:36] Americans are doing the right thing we
[48:38] get normal politics in Germany right now
[48:42] um but yeah the the conservative parties
[48:44] in Germany are very against Bitcoin and
[48:46] what I don't understand is the green
[48:48] party is against Bitcoin I talked to a
[48:50] lot of people from the green party um
[48:53] where they said well you know we are
[48:54] against Bitcoin mean yeah but you want
[48:57] an an energy change in Germany you want
[49:00] to make Germany totally dependent on
[49:02] green energy on on windmills and solar
[49:06] so this is the best opportunity for
[49:09] Bitcoin mining because in Germany when
[49:11] you have a lot of sun a lot of wind we
[49:13] have way too much energy we have to get
[49:15] rid of the energy we have to pay other
[49:17] countries to take the energy to
[49:19] stabilize our grit um so we pay millions
[49:22] for other countries just to to to take
[49:25] our our excess energy instead of having
[49:27] the Bitcoin miners starting when we have
[49:29] too much energy using this excess energy
[49:32] by Bitcoin mining and shutting down when
[49:34] we don't have enough energy anymore for
[49:36] me it's a no-brainer it's a no-brainer
[49:38] for green parties to say okay let's look
[49:40] into it we have States like Texas and
[49:43] other countries who are doing that
[49:44] already and they see it's working why is
[49:47] the green party against it why are they
[49:49] not trying we have private companies
[49:51] starting that in Germany right now we
[49:53] had one guy in our um in our events in
[49:57] in with Bitcoin in bundar who who had
[50:00] some windmills and who was installing
[50:02] Bitcoin miners by himself to to to use
[50:05] that and we asked him are you connected
[50:08] to the Bitcoin community in Germany and
[50:09] he said no they said okay we we are
[50:11] going to change that so private people
[50:13] are already doing that but the green
[50:15] party is not seeing that that they can
[50:17] do that on a much bigger scale and
[50:21] actually supporting their their own
[50:23] politics because um of their energy
[50:26] politics energy is so expensive right
[50:28] now in in Germany that normal people
[50:32] have a hard time paying their bills and
[50:34] the industry is leaving because they say
[50:36] we can't we can't afford that anymore
[50:37] we're going to to move to other
[50:40] countries with our complete fabrics and
[50:43] Industry and not producing in Germany
[50:45] anymore which is crazy I think Bitcoin
[50:48] mining is the the biggest opportunity
[50:51] for renewable energy it's so it's
[50:53] solving so many problems of the energy
[50:56] Market with grid stabilizing with
[50:58] bringing down energy costs uh with with
[51:01] so many with heat reuse uh there are
[51:04] great project where uh there is an
[51:06] apartment complex and they're using the
[51:08] heat of the Bitcoin Miners and uh paying
[51:12] the miners is cheaper than paying uh the
[51:15] the normal heating system so that
[51:18] there's really great um Innovations in
[51:22] the in the Bitcoin mining era and it's a
[51:24] Nob brain it's something where if even
[51:26] if you really dislike Bitcoin it still
[51:29] doesn't make sense to uh incentivize
[51:32] Bitcoin mining in in in your country and
[51:34] to make Innovations in that direction so
[51:37] uh it's it's just um uh there's this
[51:41] German try club and think where where
[51:43] you just like have have your eyes on on
[51:46] one focus and you're like oh Bitcoin
[51:48] that's like a capitalist bad thing for
[51:50] the environment and they don't even
[51:52] investigate further than that they don't
[51:53] even look a little bit deeper I think
[51:55] that's uh
[51:57] we we need uh to look deeper and we need
[51:59] to bring education that's why I think
[52:01] education is is the one thing that we
[52:03] just need to push as hard as possible in
[52:06] Bitcoin everywhere yeah absolutely I
[52:09] mean we actually we need to start with
[52:12] our children and teach them about the
[52:14] money system teach them about Bitcoin
[52:16] that the next generation gets it well
[52:18] the older generation won't get it
[52:20] anymore but start with the children and
[52:22] I know um that uh that there are some uh
[52:26] some Bitcoin teachers out there who
[52:29] Implement Bitcoin during their teaching
[52:32] in German schools and that's something
[52:34] which is really great to see that I was
[52:37] in Salvador in last month and me pra
[52:41] Bitcoin made a presentation and they
[52:44] told us that they're not only already
[52:46] working with the government on bringing
[52:49] education to bitcoin but the government
[52:52] is now building a Bitcoin Department in
[52:55] the education department and they are
[52:57] working to educate teachers on the
[53:00] Bitcoin and then the teachers are going
[53:02] ahead and educating the uh the students
[53:05] on bitcoin which is
[53:08] like we don't even hear about uh
[53:11] investing and and finances a lot in in
[53:14] the Austrian I don't know about the
[53:15] German probably the same problem in the
[53:17] German uh school system and they hearing
[53:20] about
[53:22] Bitcoin that's crazy that they are
[53:24] already doing that and I think
[53:26] incorporating that education in your
[53:29] country uh will have a massive impact in
[53:32] 10 20 years from now where it's really a
[53:36] a deep seed greeted in in in all of the
[53:39] all of the population and will uh bring
[53:42] rewards uh in the long run and really
[53:45] make this whole thing sustainable and I
[53:47] hope that we can make that also happen
[53:49] in Europe but I just I just don't see it
[53:52] that I don't just don't see the vision
[53:54] right now no I I also don't see it I
[53:56] mean there are there are a couple of
[53:58] teachers who are doing that but when the
[54:00] government is not doing this we have to
[54:02] do it I mean that's the only the people
[54:04] have to to start moving and and educate
[54:07] them the their children by themselves
[54:09] and and there are some great Bitcoin
[54:11] Children books out there so just buy
[54:15] them make them Christmas presents for
[54:17] all your local friends children so that
[54:21] they know what what Bitcoin is about and
[54:23] uh yeah let's hope the next generation
[54:25] is is cleverer than we are absolutely
[54:29] absolutely um one question around
[54:32] Bitcoin what what do you think is in
[54:35] Europe the most uh safe country or the
[54:39] most bullish country on on bitcoin if
[54:42] you're a bitcoiner in in what country do
[54:44] you think uh you should be in in in
[54:46] Europe right now
[54:49] um I think
[54:51] Switzerland Switzerland is doing a great
[54:53] job at the moment I mean they have some
[54:55] bitcoiners there like Samuel kman in the
[54:58] in the burner um C policy um they're
[55:01] pushing forward now they're had a bill
[55:04] asking for a report on Bitcoin mining
[55:06] and how they can use it in their County
[55:09] um look at Lugano um the it's the
[55:12] Bitcoin City I think you can pay over
[55:14] four over 400 uh um shops with Bitcoin
[55:19] and you can pay your taxes in Bitcoin so
[55:22] yeah um I think Switzerland I mean if it
[55:25] comes to money Switzerland is always
[55:26] good place to be and they they somehow
[55:29] get Bitcoin more than we do absolutely I
[55:33] even heard it uh because my dad has some
[55:35] connections uh there and he said like
[55:37] when he talks to his Austrian colleagues
[55:39] about Bitcoin it's whole different
[55:41] perspective when he talks about the
[55:43] Switzerland uh connection with on
[55:45] bitcoin they they just geted so much
[55:47] more even some sometimes they don't even
[55:49] have Bitcoin but they just get the
[55:51] properties way quicker they just get the
[55:53] the whole idea of sound money quicker so
[55:55] yeah Swit is is is very attractive also
[55:58] for me because it's just like Austria uh
[56:02] without the EU that's true that's from
[56:05] Switzerland right now yeah I mean my my
[56:08] husband is Swiss um and um I I lived in
[56:11] Switzerland for four years near Zur and
[56:14] then we moved back to Germany so um he
[56:16] was always telling me is that a good
[56:18] idea to move back to Germany it's like
[56:20] shouldn't we move back it's like yeah
[56:23] maybe I mean Switzerland is a hell of
[56:25] expensive Ive country that's you have to
[56:28] earn a lot of money to to live in
[56:30] Switzerland but they're they're clever
[56:33] than we are definitely that's one uh
[56:37] reason why I have not done it if if the
[56:41] cost probably if the cost would be
[56:43] similar I probably already would been in
[56:45] Switzerland to be honest uh but maybe
[56:49] maybe you have to compare all the cost
[56:51] also with taxes and stuff like that then
[56:53] maybe it's even cheaper in Switzerland
[56:55] but yeah Switzerland is some I'm I'm
[56:56] looking into because it's not that far
[56:58] away from Austria uh it's literally next
[57:01] to Austria but it's not uh not that far
[57:04] away from from my home region also uh so
[57:08] yeah maybe I'm in Switzerland soon let's
[57:11] see it goes in Austria I still have a
[57:13] lot of Hope for Austria uh especially as
[57:16] Austrian economics is such a big thing
[57:19] uh in in Bitcoin it would be very sad if
[57:22] Austria is turning into uh um not
[57:26] friendly for Bitcoin it would be very
[57:28] bad really cool um I have one more
[57:32] question before we start to our end tee
[57:35] um as there are now new elections in
[57:38] February uh and you're independent um
[57:41] what is your plan for for the new
[57:43] elections do you already uh H have that
[57:46] or or maybe also um if the afd is really
[57:51] a Bitcoin party now would you uh
[57:53] consider rejoining them uh how does how
[57:55] does your future plan look like no I
[57:58] won't be rejoining the party there are
[58:00] reasons I left the party um it's not the
[58:03] same party we founded in 2013 it's not
[58:06] the the freedom fighting party I was
[58:09] part of it it changed a lot I'm not um
[58:13] and didn't go into politics to follow
[58:16] other countries like Russia or China or
[58:20] Iran because I'm someone fighting for
[58:22] freedom and I'm not going to uh to build
[58:26] allies with with countries who who don't
[58:29] do that and uh who don't have the the
[58:32] basic human rights for for women or for
[58:35] everything it's not it's not everything
[58:37] is politics I mean even if you can
[58:39] benefit for
[58:41] for because of some things and because
[58:43] of some alliances we have we have to
[58:45] think about uh what's what's really
[58:48] important and for me that's freedom and
[58:51] I'm not going to to be an ally to a
[58:54] country which is fighting against
[58:56] Freedom so that's one of the reasons I
[58:58] left the afd and I'm also not a corrupt
[59:01] politician I don't take money from other
[59:04] countries or from other people to uh uh
[59:08] to vote for a certain thing um and so
[59:11] the through this I will be out of
[59:13] parliament in in February because I
[59:15] won't join any party um at the moment
[59:18] there is no party where I feel I belong
[59:21] to maybe that's going to change in the
[59:24] future I see a lot of movement in
[59:26] Germany night now I see a lot of
[59:28] Libertarians waking up and and saying
[59:31] this is not the way Germany can be ruled
[59:33] and this is not the way to go and there
[59:36] actually I was on a talk show yesterday
[59:38] with three other people at the table and
[59:41] we all realized we're not going to vote
[59:43] in the next election because we have no
[59:45] party we can vote for and they are all
[59:47] liberals they're all Libertarians on
[59:49] this on the stable and they okay we have
[59:52] to do something about that we have to
[59:55] make it possible POS for Libertarians
[59:57] and for for Freedom Fighters to have a
[59:59] party to vote for maybe this will change
[60:02] in the future we will see if there will
[60:05] be some some movement in this kind of
[60:07] Direction but at the moment I will be
[60:08] out of politics well not out of politics
[60:11] just out of the parliament I won't stay
[60:13] quiet I won't still speak up um and I
[60:16] will find other ways to to bring my my
[60:18] view across not only speaking in the
[60:21] parliament it seems like there is um
[60:25] that room for a new kind of party in in
[60:29] Germany also uh but it's
[60:33] probably probably needs a little bit
[60:35] more planning before February I don't
[60:36] know how how fast something like that
[60:38] can uh come up no it's not not going to
[60:42] happen before February that's but I
[60:44] think you also need a a lot of more time
[60:46] to to pave the way for really
[60:50] libertarian party in Germany because
[60:52] during the last years it was like the
[60:55] the government always don't worry don't
[60:57] do something by yourself we are taking
[60:59] care of you so thinking from yourself
[61:02] having self responsibility is something
[61:04] the Germans are not used to they're
[61:06] pretty AF afraid of to say okay I'm
[61:09] responsible for my own life I don't need
[61:10] the government to help me in in any kind
[61:12] of way please government Leave Me Alone
[61:15] um that's something the Germans need to
[61:18] learn and I think um it will take some
[61:21] time and then because if you have
[61:23] something someone like meay
[61:26] popping out in Germany right now I don't
[61:28] think he would win an election I think
[61:30] the Germans would be afraid of him so we
[61:32] have to pave the way for a German melee
[61:34] to say okay we're going to take over now
[61:36] and we are going to get rid of a lot of
[61:39] government departments and a lot of
[61:42] money out of the political system we
[61:45] need some time but I'm I'm a little bit
[61:48] optimistic that that might be possible
[61:51] in Germany because it's so worse so so
[61:53] bad at the moment absolutely yeah that's
[61:56] that's very very true um perfect then uh
[61:59] we have one question that each and every
[62:01] one of my guest is is getting what can
[62:04] we learn from you besides Bitcoin that's
[62:08] a good question um I think speaking up I
[62:13] think not being afraid to speak your
[62:15] mind because that's something I always
[62:17] did in my whole life I learned that from
[62:19] my father my father spoke up in Romania
[62:21] and he went to prison for it for six
[62:23] years um don't let don't be intimidated
[62:27] by intimidated by by the government or
[62:30] by anybody telling you you're not
[62:32] allowed to speak up and even if there's
[62:34] some danger you need to have people who
[62:37] speak up and they who who don't um back
[62:41] back or when when you see there there is
[62:43] backslash and there is a huge uproar in
[62:46] in the press or something and people are
[62:48] coming after you stand your ground don't
[62:52] give in you have an opinion you're
[62:54] entitled to your opinion speak up that's
[62:57] the most important thing don't be afraid
[63:00] of speaking
[63:01] up that's beautiful and we definitely
[63:03] have to do that in Bitcoin especially
[63:06] now in in Europe but also for uh the
[63:09] Americans and also for the UK people I
[63:13] know there's also a big crowd in the UK
[63:15] that is listening to the podcast it's
[63:17] also really important there uh
[63:18] Australians definitely also in Canada
[63:22] because we we are we are more than they
[63:24] are if all the people speak up if we
[63:28] stick together and say we're not we have
[63:30] enough they can't jail everybody the
[63:34] jails are not big enough for all of us
[63:36] so if all of us are speaking up they
[63:38] have no chance people forget that the
[63:41] politicians are our
[63:43] employees if the people of the country
[63:46] say enough we have enough of you
[63:48] politics is over so just keep that in
[63:51] mind that politicians are your employees
[63:54] and tell them what to do
[63:56] politics Serve the People and not the
[63:58] other way around yeah really cool um we
[64:02] have an entertain in the podcast uh
[64:04] where the previous guest is asking a
[64:05] question for the next guest without
[64:07] knowing who the next guest actually is
[64:09] and your question from the previous
[64:10] guest is do you believe there will be a
[64:13] order 6102 event with the Wall Street
[64:17] Bitcoin ETFs help me on that please
[64:21] what sorry uh the the order 6102 is
[64:25] where the confiscated gold uh back in
[64:27] the days so basically the question is do
[64:30] you think the US government will um uh
[64:34] confiscate the Bitcoin from the ETFs be
[64:37] some bitcoiners are worried about the
[64:40] big Honeypot at coinbase and the
[64:42] government is like hey we want Bitcoin
[64:44] we don't want to buy it but there's a
[64:46] lot of Bitcoin at coinbase sitting we
[64:48] can just take them well there's always a
[64:50] slight chance for politicians to do that
[64:54] um that's why I I get the ATF I think
[64:57] the ETF were important for for the a lot
[65:01] of people being able to buy Bitcoin but
[65:04] that's what I wouldn't buy ETFs but
[65:06] always have my own coins and my own Keys
[65:10] uh
[65:11] so they are politicians if they run out
[65:14] of money
[65:15] um everything might be possible true
[65:18] yeah uh it's it's definitely a
[65:20] possibility and that's why I always say
[65:22] only invest in ETFs micro strategy or
[65:27] any other Bitcoin proxy um if you have
[65:31] to like Bitcoin in self custody is
[65:34] always the better choice uh I mean if
[65:37] you have a pension account where you
[65:39] cannot get the money out and you can
[65:41] only invest in the Bitcoin ETF yeah then
[65:44] there's no possibility you have
[65:45] basically have to do that uh but make
[65:47] sure you have a nice self custody stack
[65:52] at your proposal absolutely absolutely
[65:55] perfect and thank you so much TR for
