[00:00] we don't have to have everybody under
[00:01] this burden of debt we don't have to
[00:03] have everybody being drained in terms of
[00:06] their work in terms of their hopes in
[00:08] terms of their strength in the future by
[00:10] this Fiat machine people cannot afford
[00:12] housing they cannot afford real estate
[00:14] they cannot afford to own a Land not
[00:16] everyone in the family holds Bitcoin
[00:18] it's okay as long as someone in the
[00:20] family has some when we have a Bitcoin
[00:22] standard now the whole house prices will
[00:24] crash down and when you see it in
[00:26] Bitcoin terms they're already crashing
[00:28] yes we are seeing the
[00:30] LS why especially for Africans why
[00:33] especially for canans is uh uh Bitcoin
[00:37] so important in your view um in my view
[00:40] it's that Bitcoin is first of all a
[00:42] hedge against inflation and uh currency
[00:45] depreciation in the sense that we've
[00:47] seen the Kenya Shilling losing uh its
[00:49] you know purchasing power over the last
[00:52] uh couple of decades ever since
[00:53] Independence and there's been no uh
[00:56] trusted way to actually uh hedge against
[00:59] you know some of these
[01:00] um these you know depreciations that hit
[01:03] us without a warning so even if for
[01:06] people who try to do you know business
[01:08] let's say they're in agriculture or
[01:10] they're in um you know in the financial
[01:13] markets trying to build their wealth
[01:14] through stocks the well you know the
[01:17] impact of the loss of purchasing power
[01:19] is the same and this fueled so many um
[01:22] contentions in terms of strife uh we've
[01:24] seen violence especially with land cases
[01:27] and uh court cases dragging on for years
[01:29] so that people aren't even able to enjoy
[01:31] the land that they were either supposed
[01:33] to inherit or they've tried to buy after
[01:36] working so hard to you know store their
[01:38] value and create a a financial Haven for
[01:41] themselves so in my case it's that uh I
[01:44] see Bitcoin as that alternative store
[01:46] value that does not um Inspire violence
[01:49] or does not trigger violence in uh
[01:52] people can earn it and people can save
[01:54] in it without much of a hustle and it's
[01:57] it's pretty much the best that we have
[01:58] for now and actually going
[02:02] forward that's amazing and what's what's
[02:04] the situation like there is uh do you
[02:07] have like with real estate some law that
[02:09] taxes it every year uh what's the
[02:12] inflation rate uh there is it like how
[02:14] high is it how how high is the
[02:17] pain how high is the pain let me use uh
[02:20] Nairobi the capital city as an example
[02:23] so let's say in 2005 or early 2000s you
[02:27] could get a property for about uh
[02:29] 400,000 Shillings um if today's dollar
[02:33] equivalent that would be give or take
[02:35] $2,500 but now we are talking about a
[02:38] property in Nairobi being no less than
[02:40] 11 million Shillings so um that's on the
[02:43] Lower Side uh if you're talking about
[02:46] buying land in areas like kilimani or
[02:49] kilesa which are pretty Prime and close
[02:52] to the to the you know operational
[02:54] headquarters for government and for
[02:56] international bodies we're talking about
[02:58] land being in the valuation of 100
[03:01] million Shillings 200 million Shillings
[03:03] so for the average person who is earning
[03:05] less than uh let's say $1,000 a month
[03:08] that is unaffordable so they are forced
[03:10] to rent right but now in terms of owning
[03:13] land that uh if we convert that uh 100
[03:16] million Shillings or 200 million
[03:17] Shillings in a dollar equivalent we're
[03:20] talking about 900k plus and that's
[03:23] that's not affordable for uh anyone
[03:25] who's starting or looking to earn or to
[03:27] own property in their capital city if
[03:29] you're looking at the subbs um property
[03:32] prices have gone up from the the basics
[03:35] of like 50,000 Shillings back in the you
[03:37] know early 2000s to now being 2 million
[03:40] 5 million 7 million Shillings and um
[03:43] unless someone is either in business or
[03:46] they're looking to um you know inherit
[03:48] some of these properties from their
[03:50] parents then it's becoming increasingly
[03:53] expensive and an affordable for even
[03:55] just someone who's getting out of
[03:56] college if we can you know if can just
[03:58] chart a path if you you've cleared
[04:01] College you've gotten your first job um
[04:03] it could take forever even it possibly
[04:06] be impossible to earn to own property in
[04:09] Nairobi and its subbs it's fascinating
[04:11] for me the the real estate topic and I
[04:13] think it's like all over the world the
[04:15] same problem uh people cannot afford
[04:17] housing they cannot afford real estate
[04:19] they cannot afford to own a Land and
[04:22] then we come to this really interesting
[04:24] topic where Bitcoin probably uh in my
[04:27] view will demonetize
[04:30] all of real estate like real estate has
[04:33] an utility value and on top of that is
[04:36] like 20x of the monetary value of their
[04:41] yeah monetary premium let's say on top
[04:44] of that which is amazing when we have a
[04:46] Bitcoin standard now the whole bit uh
[04:49] the whole house prices really crashed
[04:51] down and when you see it uh in in
[04:55] Bitcoin terms they are already crashing
[04:57] like with when you calculate the real
[05:00] estate prices also in Kenya over the
[05:02] last 5 to 10 years you will see they're
[05:05] crashing down all the housing prices are
[05:07] crashing down and actually getting more
[05:09] affordable in Bitcoin terms if you save
[05:12] in a feeld currency of course they're
[05:14] getting up uh and which is amazing to
[05:16] think about right yeah it's actually
[05:20] awesome to think about it because um you
[05:23] know if if I if I if I needed for
[05:25] example 100 Bitcoin to um to own my
[05:29] dream home and now I need uh probably
[05:31] less than 10 Bitcoin then it's it's
[05:34] quite profound if I have to think about
[05:36] it that way because I don't have to
[05:38] price my uh you know my long-term goals
[05:40] and my dreams in terms of uh an
[05:43] increasing number of millions in terms
[05:45] of if I if I wanted let's say 5 million
[05:47] initially then I need 10 million and so
[05:49] on and so forth then it's not about me
[05:52] working harder it's about it's about me
[05:54] um pricing or or placing my work in
[05:57] Bitcoin terms because that's how life
[06:00] becomes uh more valuable and even more
[06:02] abundant if I may think about it that
[06:04] way because um if on a fat standard I
[06:07] had to you know work so hard and do so
[06:10] many things then um it it puts attacks
[06:13] on my time it puts attacks on my energy
[06:16] it puts attacks on my relationships and
[06:18] my health because those are the things
[06:20] that people end up losing in the long
[06:22] term but on a Bitcoin standard if I need
[06:25] um less Bitcoin then my approach to work
[06:28] changes completely
[06:32] yeah amazing and I think we need to and
[06:34] that's why I'm I'm so bullish on on
[06:36] education of Bitcoin uh and that's why
[06:38] I'm also um asking a lot what's the like
[06:42] the common misconceptions the common uh
[06:44] hurdles that you have to go through when
[06:47] you speak with people outside of Bitcoin
[06:49] what are they not understanding about
[06:50] Bitcoin like what what do we have to get
[06:53] better across to no coiners that don't
[06:56] have Bitcoin they don't but they should
[06:58] have Bitcoin that
[07:00] they have problems which Bitcoin will
[07:02] solve uh what do you think are the main
[07:04] misconceptions in in their head about
[07:08] Bitcoin um thank you for that um allow
[07:11] me to allow to start with the with the
[07:14] era of scums that hit Kenya in
[07:17] especially 2016 to
[07:19] 2018 so when the scums came on board
[07:22] they promised daily returns and they you
[07:25] know they created this order that people
[07:27] could get rich quite fast and since
[07:31] there was little awareness of Bitcoin at
[07:34] the time many people put in their
[07:36] savings and some even took credit or
[07:38] loans to buy what they thought was
[07:40] Bitcoin at the time only to realize that
[07:43] they were part of a multi-level
[07:44] marketing uh entity and these entities
[07:48] keep changing their names over time so
[07:50] it's the scam just changes but the scum
[07:53] name changes but the scam is the same
[07:55] they promise daily returns um they say
[07:58] that you'll have a share of something of
[07:59] Mining and they they tend to use that
[08:01] mining word a lot then they also insist
[08:04] that you know the more people you bring
[08:06] on board the more credits you get so the
[08:09] misconceptions have stuck on that
[08:11] Foundation of scamming that if I buy
[08:13] Bitcoin I should be getting daily
[08:15] returns which is not true um the second
[08:18] misconception is that you will get rich
[08:20] quickly which is also not true because
[08:22] for Bitcoin you need patience and that
[08:25] low time preference that it's not about
[08:28] uh buying this now and selling it
[08:29] tomorrow it's not a dealer approach yes
[08:31] you can use it for payments but you know
[08:34] it's not something that you're looking
[08:36] to uh you know profit from tomorrow so
[08:39] that's one of the big traps that have
[08:41] kept people from understanding Bitcoin
[08:44] then the last the another one is that
[08:46] not the last one per se that it's um you
[08:48] know it's not exactly legal it's not
[08:50] exactly safe which is not true it's
[08:52] perfectly uh permissionless that you
[08:54] don't need um you don't need like a a
[08:56] legal entity to permit you to use a
[08:59] transact Bitcoin so in Kenya the there's
[09:01] a circular notice cautionary notice that
[09:04] was issued by the Central Bank in
[09:07] 2015 and since that time the the the
[09:11] limit has been and the restriction on
[09:13] banks is that they cannot facilitate any
[09:16] Bitcoin transaction directly but that
[09:19] has not been the you know the limit for
[09:21] people to buy Bitcoin because there are
[09:24] peer-to-peer networks that allow people
[09:26] to transact through mobile money or now
[09:29] other peer networks so if the fact that
[09:32] anyone can actually easily buy Bitcoin
[09:35] in Kenya even over like five minutes
[09:38] it's that you don't need to go through
[09:40] so many huddles CU I think that's the
[09:41] other huddle that or that that's the
[09:44] other limit that people think that you
[09:45] need to know someone you have to have
[09:48] someone opening an account for you or
[09:50] that you need to go through a very long
[09:52] process to on bitcoin those things are
[09:54] not true it's that it's a simple process
[09:57] so uh for me education is a big deal
[10:00] because um I'm I'm sometimes struck by
[10:03] how profound it is that if you tell
[10:05] someone and you actually show them how
[10:07] to open a wallet how to buy their first
[10:09] Bitcoin within minutes then you can
[10:11] actually see that they um you know they
[10:13] begin to warm up to it that they didn't
[10:16] need to go through a very long process
[10:18] to get their first
[10:21] Bitcoin yeah amazing and how did you get
[10:24] over those hurdles like did you discover
[10:27] Bitcoin uh with the SC scams before the
[10:30] scams how did you go through that
[10:33] process um I was fortunate actually to
[10:36] know about Bitcoin before the scams so I
[10:39] heard about it in a documentary a friend
[10:42] of mine sent me a a link to it in
[10:45] 2016 and there happened to be one Forum
[10:48] in Nairobi that was hosted September uh
[10:51] SE the second weekend of September 2016
[10:54] so when I attended and they you know
[10:55] they told they spoke about Bitcoin as
[10:58] the you know future of money and it's a
[11:01] you know it's a monetary Network at the
[11:03] time it was around $600 if I remember
[11:06] right but what didn't make sense to me
[11:08] was that I'm giving $600 to someone I
[11:10] don't know so uh that's that was the
[11:14] I'll say the the introductory part but
[11:17] as I got to learn more about it in uh
[11:20] 2017 uh 2018 as well I had the uh I had
[11:25] the benefit of attending meetups and
[11:27] forums where people were talking about
[11:28] it people are asking questions um I also
[11:31] attended some of the scum forums and I
[11:35] you know I I found that they were not
[11:36] making sense because they you know the
[11:39] their numbers just didn't add up and I
[11:40] was I had the benefit of learning by
[11:42] then so I didn't buy in I I bought my
[11:44] first bcoin in
[11:47] 2019 and that's now after I felt
[11:49] comfortable uh you know understanding
[11:51] the basics of the bare Market the bull
[11:54] market um why the price came down I
[11:57] understood enough now to just buy it on
[11:58] my own and I felt awesome to just you
[12:01] know have my first my first ownership
[12:03] with Bitcoin amazing amazing and you uh
[12:07] also big on Austrian economics right I
[12:09] saw some I think I saw some tweets of
[12:11] yours was it you yes what do you think
[12:14] of like I'm always uh keen on Austrian
[12:17] economics because um I'm from
[12:20] Austria but unfortunately Austrian
[12:23] economics has nothing to do with the
[12:25] actual Austrian economic situation right
[12:28] now uh but it's uh it's it's always
[12:31] interesting for me to see that atin
[12:33] economics is such a popular theme in in
[12:36] in in Bitcoin which makes me glad that
[12:38] I'm Austrian and that some some time in
[12:41] the past there were bright austrians
[12:44] that have some economic views that are
[12:46] now implemented with Bitcoin what do you
[12:48] think of Austrian economics is it like
[12:50] um did you discover it before uh Bitcoin
[12:53] and what's your take on
[12:55] it so yes I did discover it before bit
[12:59] co uh I had my undergraduate as a
[13:01] Bachelor of Science in economics so I
[13:04] had let me call it a bit of an unfair
[13:05] Advantage just understanding um the
[13:08] micro macro principles Theory now in the
[13:11] course of studying I remember feeling a
[13:14] a sense of Disconnect like yes we're
[13:17] studying about for example austan
[13:19] economics as a you know as a preferred
[13:22] or Superior way in terms of uh economic
[13:24] thought but what I could see for example
[13:28] in uh implementation of government
[13:30] policy would leave out so many things
[13:32] that um you wonder okay we're studying
[13:36] economics as a as a as a discipline or
[13:38] as an area of study right but how do we
[13:41] link up with the policy because the
[13:43] people who are in uh elective positions
[13:46] end up making the decisions right so I
[13:48] realized that I needed to um just read
[13:51] more engage more and just understand how
[13:53] things work because it's easy to get
[13:56] stuck between the ideal of how things
[13:58] should be and the actual reality of how
[14:01] politics affects the economy ah okay
[14:04] okay okay and this this is
[14:07] something what which always amazes me uh
[14:11] when we talk about Bitcoin how uh like I
[14:15] also studied in Austria economics but
[14:18] there was nothing with with austan
[14:19] economics uh actually uh which is is
[14:22] quite amazing um and uh you are uh um
[14:28] You probably also had more canes in
[14:30] economics in your your studies um how
[14:33] did you overcome this like uh did your
[14:36] did your study actually help you in in
[14:39] understanding Bitcoin you said you have
[14:40] an unfair advantage in understanding it
[14:42] but was it actually influencing your
[14:44] study of Bitcoin
[14:46] then so at the time if I may um you know
[14:49] kind of step back in time I I put what I
[14:53] studied to the test right now getting
[14:55] into the world of work and now seeing
[14:58] how things go pretty much um you know
[15:00] how how people step into influence um
[15:04] how elections are carried out how um for
[15:07] example in Kenya then we see the the the
[15:11] transfer of power let's say it's quite
[15:12] connected to certain communities more
[15:14] than others ER it it made me question a
[15:17] lot of things and in the process of
[15:20] questioning I would say that it helped
[15:22] me realize that in as much as there's an
[15:24] idealized view of the world or uh
[15:27] principles that would actually guide it
[15:29] in a certain way there are limits in
[15:31] terms of the realities because if we for
[15:34] example see the you know the the
[15:36] thinking around government Fiat it's um
[15:39] it's supposed to be that we should trust
[15:41] the government to do right by the
[15:43] resources and the power that it has
[15:45] right and we keep seeing the ideal being
[15:48] pushed out that this is supposed to
[15:49] happen that is supposed to happen this
[15:51] is supposed to happen Healthcare should
[15:53] be this way uh education should be this
[15:55] way uh energy should be you know uh it
[15:58] should be affordable and so and so on
[16:00] and so forth but in the reality then we
[16:02] see um an abuse of trust an abuse of
[16:05] authority in the sense that uh one
[16:08] policy going after another policy that
[16:10] disempowers people or that makes uh the
[16:13] cost of living higher or that makes um
[16:16] life quite more difficult for the for
[16:18] the average citizen then this disparity
[16:21] I think is where our discussion needs to
[16:23] dwell because it's not so much about the
[16:25] ideals that we keep but the reality that
[16:28] we we need to deal
[16:31] with amazing if to think uh when you
[16:35] take this whole context uh of what you
[16:38] just said is then uh El
[16:41] Salvador um a role model in accepting
[16:45] Bitcoin and implementing a sound money
[16:47] system uh or what could have Salvador
[16:50] done better I mean I don't know if you
[16:52] have been to El
[16:54] Salvador um I haven't been to El
[16:56] Salvador yet but I love the initial that
[16:59] they have taken in terms of the risk
[17:01] first of all and the boldness to stand
[17:04] by their commitment to implement um you
[17:06] know Bitcoin not only as a not only as a
[17:09] you know um legalized I would say
[17:12] currency in their country but um putting
[17:16] their money where the mouse is uh in
[17:17] terms of even the bonds how they've
[17:19] appreciated I think they they their
[17:22] Milestones will be worth studying for
[17:24] Nations and in as much as there will be
[17:27] um opposition to
[17:29] to adopting a Bitcoin standard that
[17:32] opposition is okay I think Future
[17:35] Leaders uh young leaders myself and my
[17:38] peers we are the ones who are stepping
[17:39] into these um positions of influence so
[17:43] it's not about um even just seeing what
[17:46] El Salvador has done but taking the risk
[17:49] and um putting our money where our mouth
[17:51] is not just trying to fix the old system
[17:54] but stepping into this new one because
[17:56] trying to fix the old system increases
[17:59] ly becomes um untenable so if I may use
[18:02] the the you know like the recent um you
[18:07] know like I would say policy in terms of
[18:08] the dollar the rate hikes um since the
[18:11] Kenya Shilling is fed to the dollar
[18:13] whatever happens to the dollar tends to
[18:15] be Amplified in the Shilling so for
[18:17] example if we try to fix policy in Kenya
[18:20] then it becomes that it becomes a matter
[18:23] of understanding what's going on in you
[18:25] know what's going on in the US what's
[18:26] happening to the dollar because if we
[18:28] can't if you can't touch that then
[18:30] there's very little we can do to um save
[18:33] the Shing or have an impact in terms of
[18:35] its um you know its Improvement do you
[18:38] see a possibility where when we have
[18:40] like I think it's clear that fiat
[18:42] currency will collapse like that I think
[18:45] there's no way around that I mean it's
[18:46] collapsing since like so many years so
[18:48] many decades and it will continue to
[18:51] collapse and eventually maybe even F
[18:53] Fade Out or crash completely uh but as
[18:57] an alternative maybe governments or do
[19:00] you see as an alternative to do that
[19:03] that maybe governments say let's try it
[19:06] again with gold let's let's uh again
[19:10] find a gold standard buy more gold uh
[19:12] Peg it one to two one to three do you
[19:15] think this is a possibility where
[19:16] government saying gold is again the the
[19:19] asset and then regain the Trust In in
[19:22] FEI currency in paper money I think they
[19:25] will try and in in all in all that is
[19:29] within their means um they will try
[19:32] because gold is that safe heaven that
[19:34] they have trusted for years however the
[19:37] question in this is that how much gold
[19:40] will be will be enough to save any of
[19:43] the Fiat currencies around the world
[19:45] right uh how much you know how much gold
[19:48] will be enough for one currency to um
[19:51] you know not have to outprice or be or
[19:53] have an unfair advantage over another
[19:55] right um it will it could actually
[19:58] create now more tension in terms of uh
[20:00] gold Holdings in the different countries
[20:03] and it still leads to that um you know
[20:06] that scarcity and that tension between
[20:08] nations in terms of who will trust who
[20:10] to back up another and it still comes
[20:13] back to the same Quagmire that we have
[20:15] right now with uh Fiat currencies so if
[20:17] I may use like Kenya's situation as an
[20:20] example we Kenya is a is a technically a
[20:23] net importer meaning that we bring in
[20:26] now we import most of the goods and the
[20:28] services that we need in the economy so
[20:30] that's why um you know the you know
[20:33] earning dollars is quite a big deal so
[20:36] um unless for example we fix the
[20:39] fundamentals of business just people
[20:41] being able to earn income or export
[20:43] their goods and their services um then
[20:46] people still need dollars to import and
[20:49] by the time for example um we need or we
[20:52] have multilateral agreements for example
[20:55] with Ethiopia or India or any other
[20:57] country that we doing business with and
[21:00] agree to settle with with them in their
[21:02] currencies or in our currency that's
[21:04] still a long shot we're not we're not
[21:06] escaping the fundamental exposure to the
[21:08] dollar and um one one other one other
[21:12] strain for example on the economy is the
[21:14] extent of of loans and credits that are
[21:17] on an increasing amount against the GDP
[21:20] so it's still it's still uh calls for a
[21:24] form of you know control on the
[21:25] fundamentals because if we keep
[21:27] borrowing then we'll still need more
[21:29] dollars and um unfortunately if the you
[21:32] know the the solution for now is to tax
[21:34] people then it still creates a choke a
[21:37] choke hold on businesses so the
[21:39] fundamental is to fix the business
[21:41] environment and let it generate enough
[21:43] Revenue at least for people to just meet
[21:45] their needs pay their staff and um you
[21:48] know just just have the right have the
[21:51] right environment to do to be more
[21:53] productive instead of um being choked by
[21:56] policies and taxes and more more loans
[22:00] it's not it's not a healthy
[22:03] cycle yeah and and addition to that that
[22:05] they have also to adopt the sound M
[22:07] standard right when a business is
[22:09] running uh even if a business is really
[22:11] doing good and they are running good and
[22:14] customers come in but if they save in in
[22:18] currency that is just depleting of of
[22:20] value uh in the end of the day they they
[22:22] don't have anything from that right it's
[22:24] a it's it's it's fascinating to
[22:27] see um
[22:29] when we see now a little bit in the
[22:31] future and I now today I today I
[22:34] released the podcast about that
[22:36] um and why also people choose to stay
[22:40] private in in in Bitcoin like we are
[22:42] obviously with our face and we say
[22:44] Bitcoin is good and we obviously um
[22:47] outspoken bitcoiners but there are also
[22:49] a lot of bitcoiners that want to stay
[22:51] Anonymous and their thesis usually is
[22:55] that they think that Bitcoin will be
[22:58] really successful and that feed will
[22:59] collapse and not a lot of people will
[23:02] jump on to bitcoin soon enough and
[23:05] therefore it will cause some social um
[23:10] trauma some social um yeah threats uh to
[23:14] bitcoiners uh um do you think uh we
[23:18] we're running at the risk if feeld is
[23:20] collapsing too fast and Bitcoin is
[23:22] rising too fast that there could be
[23:25] social um things happening where Bitcoin
[23:29] uh will be attacked where privacy and
[23:32] non cacy is is really
[23:36] important yes uh fundamentally it's that
[23:39] Bitcoin is especially for you know
[23:41] bitcoiners who stay Anonymous I have
[23:43] learned and have been part of a few
[23:45] discussions where the concern about um
[23:48] you know being publicly identified as a
[23:50] bitcoiner is increasingly becoming a
[23:53] risk because um let's say in the last uh
[23:56] 10 years of or 15 years of bitcoin's
[23:59] existence you could be dismissed right
[24:01] um you're a bitcoiner I don't care
[24:03] what's that you you're probably being
[24:05] associated with being like a shady
[24:07] person or a cyber cyber Punk somewhere
[24:10] or a criminal but um they could dismiss
[24:12] you but now they're interested like wait
[24:14] a minute you talking about Bitcoin you
[24:17] say you hold Bitcoin now they want to
[24:19] know how much so the shift in that
[24:23] becomes um quite interesting because yes
[24:26] safety is a big deal and that's why
[24:28] we've seen for example on X um a common
[24:31] phrase that like uh I lost my Bitcoin in
[24:34] a boating accident or I lost my Bitcoin
[24:37] in in you in this way or a fishing
[24:39] attack or something um I do believe some
[24:41] of them are genuine losses and I do
[24:44] understand that some of them are um very
[24:47] safe ways for people to just dis
[24:49] disconnect their public uh you know
[24:52] image and and and personality from
[24:55] actual holding of Bitcoin right but for
[24:57] Bitcoin it's definitely going to be um
[25:00] important to just um be smart about the
[25:03] storage beat and I think we have amazing
[25:05] options for whole storage right now so
[25:08] um it's going to be as a matter of of
[25:10] safety and concern and I agree with that
[25:13] so the other thing is that in terms of
[25:15] fat collapsing it's that yes we we are
[25:18] seeing the collapse I think the thing
[25:20] that is a bit of a uh an unforeseen
[25:23] event is government's actually doing
[25:26] everything they can to stop uh the
[25:28] societal collapse and I know we don't
[25:31] talk about this enough but faith in
[25:33] people I think we need to in as much as
[25:36] there's the Doom of fat collapsing and
[25:38] the risk of it uh having so many rle
[25:41] effects in society um I believe in the
[25:44] resilience of people because in as much
[25:47] as people see the you know the hardship
[25:49] the adversity and the things that are
[25:52] against them right now the resilience of
[25:54] the human spirit is so powerful that we
[25:56] need to as Bitcoin has also speak to the
[26:00] faith of humanity that yes we can see um
[26:03] this the systems are against us but that
[26:05] doesn't mean they stop us and they
[26:06] disempower us completely because in
[26:09] terms of that equation then people can
[26:11] still uh unite people can still stand up
[26:15] for each other people can still um you
[26:17] know hold for for their loved ones
[26:19] because it's not so much about saving
[26:22] everyone or saving everything from
[26:23] collapse but standing where you are or
[26:26] standing where I am because if I can
[26:28] stand for my family if you can stand for
[26:30] your loved ones then I think there is
[26:32] hope in as much as we are seeing the you
[26:34] know the the risks of Fe collapsing and
[26:38] putting so much threat and and like uh
[26:40] strain on our societies 21 Bitcoin is
[26:43] Bitcoin only from day one and did teach
[26:46] and preach self- custody this is my goto
[26:50] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[26:52] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[26:55] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[26:58] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[27:01] support this podcast use code Robin and
[27:04] click the link in the description it's a
[27:06] it's it's very beautiful what you what
[27:09] you just said uh thank you for that and
[27:11] I think it's also
[27:13] an and task of every bitcoiner when he
[27:17] gets Bitcoin or she gets Bitcoin that we
[27:20] are thinking of our loved ones next like
[27:24] who do I really love who's in my family
[27:27] like my parents my um brother sister my
[27:30] family my uh girlfriend uh boyfriend my
[27:35] my wife whatever um we have to also care
[27:39] for them not only in like a love and
[27:42] caring way but also in a financial way
[27:44] we have to
[27:46] see how can I ensure that they are
[27:49] onboarded on bitcoin and that they are
[27:51] on the right ship not on the Fe ship
[27:53] they on the Bitcoin ship when when
[27:56] hits the fan we we probably need that
[27:58] and so I'm uh stacking not no not only
[28:02] really really hard for myself but also
[28:05] for my family I have a really big family
[28:08] and a lot of them don't get Bitcoin so I
[28:10] have to stack a lot uh for in order for
[28:13] in in to care for them and yeah and
[28:16] Bitcoin gives us hope right it's it's
[28:18] it's something that that gives humanity
[28:21] and individuals something to to look
[28:24] forward because if we did not have
[28:26] Bitcoin what do we have right what like
[28:29] what what would you do the right now
[28:31] without
[28:33] Bitcoin it's a it's a powerful question
[28:36] and I think I was read I was reading
[28:37] about something recently that um
[28:40] students and teenagers are opting for
[28:43] skill-based work like U either ship
[28:45] sharing or plumbing and um you know
[28:48] taking care of farms instead of going to
[28:51] college and you know we've talked about
[28:53] we've we've seen the the extent of the
[28:56] student uh student loan burden in so
[28:58] many countries that you're owning you
[29:00] know if you owe a couple thousand do or
[29:03] $100,000 in debt as a student you're
[29:05] already set back in life because not
[29:07] everybody gets uh the kind of work or or
[29:11] opportunity to pay off that debt we've
[29:13] seen uh people in their in their late in
[29:16] their late years their Sunset years
[29:18] still owing student debt I think that's
[29:20] terrible so if students are opting early
[29:23] to just opt out of the system then there
[29:26] is hope it's a message I I mean enough
[29:28] people are seeing that instead of uh you
[29:31] know not not having a work guarantee
[29:34] because you have a degree it's uh it
[29:37] only makes sense for you to start
[29:39] looking at ways for you to make income
[29:41] for yourself without so much debt over
[29:43] your head right and that if people opt
[29:46] out enough I think it's it's going to be
[29:48] a a CR critical Tipping Point and that's
[29:51] why I feel like in as much as we are you
[29:53] know as as bitcoiners and people who are
[29:56] able to see how things go we able to
[29:59] question um you know society and Trends
[30:02] Direction and government in as much as
[30:04] we're able to ask these questions then
[30:07] we need to begin to speak into the hope
[30:10] of humanity that we don't have to have
[30:12] everybody under this burden of debt we
[30:14] don't have to have everybody being uh
[30:17] drained in terms of their work in terms
[30:19] of their hopes in terms of their
[30:21] strength in their future by this Fiat
[30:23] machine right even if it doesn't
[30:26] collapse on its own weight the thing is
[30:28] that people still have time people still
[30:30] have hope right um even as for example
[30:34] let me say for my family not everybody
[30:36] um um holds or owns Bitcoin right but um
[30:40] for example my aunt I helped her like
[30:42] create her past wallet last year and it
[30:44] was so fulfilling just to see her you
[30:46] know opting in and yes I would love
[30:49] everybody in my family to you know have
[30:51] their own holding of Bitcoin but um if
[30:54] we too are the ones just as we've uh
[30:57] mentioned are the ones who are looking
[30:58] out for a family then perhaps the
[31:02] adoption of Bitcoin doesn't need to be
[31:04] that everyone is individually adopting
[31:07] Bitcoin but someone in every family
[31:10] having at least a holding of Bitcoin
[31:12] because that's a better shot at the
[31:15] future than us trying to get you know
[31:17] everybody everybody everybody at once
[31:19] right that may not work out and um if I
[31:22] may link this for example to the idea of
[31:25] number go up and you know we we're
[31:27] trying to see see um yes we're looking
[31:29] at this future of Bitcoin worth uh so
[31:31] much more than it is right now that's
[31:34] awesome but are we individ are we let's
[31:37] say in each family increasing the amount
[31:39] of Bitcoin that we have and for me
[31:42] that's that's um that's changed like how
[31:44] I approach the education uh efforts that
[31:47] I put in because if for example we just
[31:50] you know speak into the hope of humanity
[31:52] and just bring out the best of people
[31:55] then you know put in that aspect that if
[31:58] not everyone in the family holds Bitcoin
[32:00] it's okay as long as someone in the
[32:02] family has some that's that's a better
[32:04] shot at at the future yeah amazing and
[32:07] um I'm also seeing it in my family where
[32:11] like few years back when I came into
[32:14] Bitcoin I was the only one and now there
[32:17] are some cousins there some uncles there
[32:20] my dad and stuff like that who also get
[32:22] Bitcoin like they have Bitcoin and they
[32:24] get it uh so I'm I'm enjoying getting
[32:27] the big Family Table and more and more
[32:30] uh orange people are in there so I'm I'm
[32:32] liking the the conversation and and the
[32:35] progress there um what I like we talked
[32:38] about now like what if there's no
[32:40] Bitcoin but um what there is Bitcoin and
[32:44] we have this hope uh and what are you uh
[32:47] doing in in the Bitcoin Community right
[32:52] now right now I'm focusing on uh
[32:55] education because it still comes back to
[32:57] that that all the all the effort toward
[33:00] economy and uh better you know better
[33:03] regulatory support or more Partnerships
[33:06] coming on in for example in Kenya it's
[33:09] centered on education and I have re I
[33:12] have on different occasions just settle
[33:13] back toward that foundation so it's it's
[33:17] quite something that I'm doubling down
[33:19] upon this year amazing amazing yeah
[33:22] perfect uh then this was already a lot
[33:25] and really really cool uh thank you for
[33:27] that um are you actually using also I'm
[33:30] just curious what you're doing do you
[33:32] use value for Value platforms like
[33:34] Nostra Fountain and stuff like
[33:37] that um at the risk of you know being
[33:40] grilled by the Bitcoin Community I'm not
[33:42] yet on nostr but I know um I should I
[33:44] should put in some effort to build
[33:47] reputation there but um yeah I've been
[33:50] I've been I think for me my learning cup
[33:52] has has gone pretty high in the last
[33:54] year or
[33:55] so yeah it's it's a I'm actually also
[33:59] not uh directly on Nostra my my podcast
[34:03] is on Fountain so uh like people can
[34:07] find me kind of on Nostra because
[34:09] Fountain will get integrated with Nostra
[34:11] or is integrated with Nostra already uh
[34:14] I heard from from from the from the
[34:16] founder there um I'm always curious what
[34:20] people are doing at the moment um maybe
[34:23] even outside of Pitkin like what are you
[34:25] currently studying and learning about
[34:28] uh which is uh it can be about Bitcoin
[34:30] it can be outside of Bitcoin like what
[34:32] are you currently into which you really
[34:35] passionate
[34:37] about oh that's a that's an awesome one
[34:40] I think uh psychology first I I like
[34:43] reading just about how people relate
[34:46] what motivates them why they make
[34:48] decisions the way they do um I've been
[34:50] reading quite a lot about that um tags
[34:53] also on like um somatic therapy Shadow
[34:57] work uh healthy diet and just you know
[35:00] how to how to take care of the body in
[35:02] um in different in different like blood
[35:05] blood group types I know there's been a
[35:07] bit of a discussion slash dispute around
[35:10] the blood Tech diet so uh that's one
[35:12] thing I'm currently studying um what
[35:14] else am I am I looking at study-wise I'm
[35:18] I've been doing a study on the on the
[35:20] relationship between um like uh digital
[35:24] digital
[35:25] governance as it relates to can return
[35:28] so you see how for Bitcoin you have um
[35:31] you know we we know we know we have the
[35:33] the Haring right the block height is is
[35:36] uh is predetermined the supply schedule
[35:40] is sure and it's decentralized as a
[35:42] network we can identify the number of
[35:44] nodes now this is a form of digital
[35:47] governance that um over time tends to
[35:50] create a predict a prediction over the
[35:52] risk and return of Bitcoin so that's
[35:55] that if we knew for example
[35:58] um four years ago or 8 years ago that if
[36:01] you have an 8ye hold or an 8year
[36:05] commitment to hold your Bitcoin you're
[36:07] better off than someone who is looking
[36:09] at it on a one year Horizon because they
[36:12] may look at it for example on a on a
[36:15] post uh on a post bull market and for
[36:18] them they'd think that you know Bitcoin
[36:20] is cannot give returns but in an 8ye
[36:23] horizon then they can realize um these
[36:25] returns are far more significant than um
[36:29] most stock markets or most index funds
[36:31] and most um mutual funds and other in
[36:35] and other um investment vehicles that
[36:37] people have trusted over the years right
[36:40] so I'm I'm building a a thesis around
[36:43] that and in a few months I think I
[36:45] should have a paper ready yeah which
[36:47] also makes me think of um how will
[36:51] governments in general like how will
[36:54] then we have Bitcoin and digital
[36:55] governance how will then governments uh
[37:00] exist when we have Bitcoin do did you
[37:03] thought about that how in in like 50
[37:06] hundred years maybe when we have a
[37:08] Bitcoin standard how how governments can
[37:11] exist and how different the service or
[37:14] this government system will be in a
[37:16] Bitcoin
[37:18] world yes I have thought about that now
[37:22] uh governments yes will still exist
[37:24] could be still in their current form
[37:26] elective or representative uh government
[37:30] because we have um we have the
[37:33] fundamentals of of human human nature
[37:35] and human interest in hierarchy and
[37:38] power and governance right so it's it's
[37:40] going to be hard for people to switch
[37:42] away from uh what they have known about
[37:45] form of government but in terms of money
[37:47] then the conversation will be different
[37:49] because um in as much as people see the
[37:53] relationship between uh Government
[37:55] funding and government policy then I
[37:59] think there will be a greater push for
[38:00] accountability in terms of if these
[38:03] people are elected to make decisions
[38:05] that represents the will of the people
[38:07] and they don't do that then there will
[38:09] be a greater push and people actually
[38:11] being more involved in government than
[38:13] uh disin volved or passive about it so I
[38:16] think that's one of the things I foresee
[38:18] in the next 50 years that um people will
[38:20] be more interested in the rules and the
[38:23] and the policies that affect their lives
[38:24] directly and even if they do not adopt a
[38:27] Bitcoin standard uh which will still
[38:30] coexist it's that they will have um they
[38:33] will have the they will have the
[38:35] boldness to push for this accountability
[38:37] because it will be more evident to
[38:39] people for example that Bitcoin is
[38:41] transparent right The Ledger is uh
[38:44] audited every 10 minutes and we can see
[38:46] the addition of new blocks and the
[38:48] issuance the transfers and all that but
[38:50] if we can see this level of transparency
[38:53] in um National budgets and and the you
[38:56] know the issuance or distribution of
[38:58] resources in a nation then I think more
[39:00] people will be interested in that
[39:02] especially if uh you know like you know
[39:04] if we know you're paying taxes and these
[39:06] taxes are not being used in the right
[39:08] way then people will stop sitting back
[39:10] and push for more accountability yeah
[39:13] this is I'm I'm looking forward to this
[39:16] world as you describe it I'm like yes
[39:19] yes yes yes I want that World um we have
[39:22] an end routine in the podcast uh and
[39:24] it's it has been a pleasure with talking
[39:27] with you we and in the podcast where the
[39:30] previous guest is asking a question for
[39:32] the next guest and the previous guest uh
[39:35] is
[39:37] uh an El Salvadorian who is born abroad
[39:42] but then came back to his home country
[39:44] El Salvador because of the PUK and
[39:47] because of the Bitcoin standard then he
[39:49] stayed also there um his question to you
[39:53] was when are you coming to El Salvador
[39:57] oh wow that's a beautiful challenge um
[40:01] let me see let me see let me see if uh
[40:03] let me put the let me put the window
[40:05] within the
[40:07] year yeah a year perfect yeah maybe you
[40:11] can come to the uh adopting Bitcoin
[40:14] conference in I think November it is uh
[40:18] because I'm also thinking going there in
[40:20] November to the to the Bitcoin
[40:22] conference it uh it would be amazing to
[40:25] to see a lot of bitcoiners there in as
[40:27] Salvador uh with a lot of high signal
[40:30] and uh no noise whatsoever which which
[40:34] I'm hoping for then uh thank you
[40:36] Roseline for for the interview it was a
[40:38] pleasure talking with you if now people
[40:40] want to reach out to you and people want
