[00:00] the focus at this point in time for any
[00:02] investor in the world should be Bitcoin
[00:04] the future on average home will be less
[00:06] than 0.1 Bitcoin the total value of all
[00:09] real estate Assets in the world is
[00:10] around $330 trillion and then Bitcoin is
[00:13] a trillion dollar asset so a 50 million
[00:16] doll um bitcoin price Target is
[00:18] realistic when you think what could buy
[00:20] you 50 million today when I understood
[00:22] that that Bitcoin is superior store of
[00:24] value to real estate and it's the
[00:26] fastest growing asset class in the world
[00:28] I really started to understand that it
[00:30] most likely will have an impact on real
[00:33] estate you will not say oh my house is
[00:34] worth $1 million we just say my house is
[00:37] worth 0.1 Bitcoin change starts with the
[00:40] individual so in order for housing to
[00:42] become more affordable the individual
[00:44] has to take action himself or herself
[00:46] and buy Bitcoin to be able to afford
[00:49] more in the future because Bitcoin is
[00:51] this inflationary the new unit of
[00:53] account that I personally use is Bitcoin
[00:55] and it's repricing every asset in the
[00:57] world and if you price real estate in
[00:59] Bitcoin coin you can see how drastically
[01:01] real estate is falling in price when
[01:03] measured against Bitcoin if I want to
[01:05] sell my house I'm not going to ask for
[01:07] fiat currency I'm going to ask for
[01:09] Bitcoin you can refinance the existing
[01:12] debt that sits on the property and you
[01:14] use that money for whatever you wish
[01:16] usually what people do they um buy more
[01:18] real estate but I suggest buy some
[01:20] Bitcoin even if you buy it on Leverage
[01:22] you cannot outperform
[01:24] [Music]
[01:27] Bitcoin I want to really dive deep today
[01:30] the topic of real estate and Bitcoin I
[01:32] think uh you're the best person to speak
[01:34] to uh when it comes to real estate and
[01:35] Bitcoin and also how Real Estate
[01:38] Investors potentially can benefit from
[01:40] from Bitcoin uh but let's first dive
[01:42] into like you came from Real Estate and
[01:44] now you're into Bitcoin like why did you
[01:47] uh came into Bitcoin and why what made
[01:49] Bitcoin so attractive for you as an real
[01:51] estate investor yeah um actually I I
[01:54] came I didn't really come into Bitcoin
[01:57] from Real Estate I was a bitcoiner that
[02:01] worked in the real estate industry and
[02:02] that helped me to get deeper into
[02:04] Bitcoin so when I got into Bitcoin I
[02:07] didn't work yet I got into Bitcoin in
[02:09] University and back then I had an
[02:11] academic um I'd say perspective I was
[02:14] doing research on money and I was doing
[02:17] research on alternative monies and at
[02:20] the time there wasn't only Bitcoin there
[02:23] were um there was no other
[02:25] cryptocurrency but there were different
[02:27] concepts Concepts that still exist to
[02:29] today um basic Universal income um there
[02:33] was even at the time I even met some
[02:36] people that were thinking of implanting
[02:38] microchips uh in their hand to use that
[02:40] as sort of a credit card and a credit
[02:42] system and Bitcoin was one of the
[02:44] options I looked into but I intuitively
[02:47] liked it because it felt uh it felt
[02:49] right uh and then I wrote my master
[02:52] thesis about Bitcoin and I studied
[02:54] Financial economics and then I went into
[02:56] the real estate industry so um I was
[02:59] stacking sets and working in the real
[03:01] estate industry parallel without
[03:04] combining the two or without thinking of
[03:06] combining the two but then over time by
[03:09] working in the real estate industry I
[03:11] started to understand the real potential
[03:14] of Bitcoin because when I first got into
[03:16] Bitcoin I was only interested in Bitcoin
[03:18] as a medium of exchange um I wasn't
[03:21] really looking at Bitcoin the asset I
[03:23] was looking at Bitcoin the network and I
[03:25] thought Bitcoin is really interesting
[03:27] for uh a variety of things but also for
[03:30] the remittance market and I always
[03:32] thought people you take fiat currency
[03:34] convert it into Bitcoin send it
[03:36] somewhere to the other side of the world
[03:39] and convert it back into feat currency
[03:41] similar to what strike is doing now that
[03:43] was around like 2015
[03:45] 2016 um that is because I had a
[03:47] Keynesian background and money for me
[03:50] was a means of consumption I didn't
[03:52] really understand money as a store of
[03:54] value so the Austrian perspective is
[03:57] something I only learned through Bitcoin
[03:58] and then while I worked in the real
[04:00] estate industry I started to
[04:02] realize the total value of all real
[04:05] estate Assets in the world is around
[04:07] $330 trillion there are different
[04:09] estimates but I'm going to stick with
[04:11] this number now because it's a number
[04:13] that's generally referenced in Bitcoin
[04:15] circles because Jesse Myers created this
[04:17] beautiful chart that you probably also
[04:19] are aware of and then Bitcoin is a
[04:22] trillion dollar asset back then it was a
[04:24] billion dollar asset and even as a half
[04:27] a trillion dollar asset or as a trillion
[04:29] dollar asset looking at real estate I
[04:31] think really helps um to understand the
[04:34] potential of Bitcoin because real estate
[04:36] is the L largest store of value in the
[04:38] world and Bitcoin is a superior store of
[04:41] value because it's easier to maintain
[04:44] and it's mobile and highly liquid you
[04:46] know real estate isn't liquid and it's
[04:47] very expensive to maintain and Bitcoin
[04:50] is cheap to maintain there's almost no
[04:51] maintainance cost you just have to take
[04:53] care of self- custody when I understood
[04:56] that that Bitcoin is a superior store of
[04:59] value to real estate and it's the
[05:02] fastest growing asset class in the world
[05:05] I really started to understand that it
[05:07] most likely will have an impact on real
[05:09] estate because people buy real estate to
[05:11] hatch themselves against inflation I
[05:13] mean it's that's something that we all
[05:15] are aware of what you do with your money
[05:18] you invest your money in order to save
[05:20] it in order to outperform inflation and
[05:23] one of the most used assets to do that
[05:27] is real estate people put in their money
[05:28] in real estate to protect it against
[05:30] monetary inflation and they do it
[05:33] because real estate is scars and they
[05:34] also do it because they are good
[05:36] financing options for Real Estate right
[05:38] but Bitcoin is a superior option to
[05:40] secure value over time and space and I
[05:44] therefore believe it's actually
[05:46] competition to real estate that might
[05:48] sound strange strange to real estate
[05:50] investor because there's a different
[05:52] utility in real estate which you can use
[05:54] to live in or you can use it to produce
[05:57] or you can use it for as an event space
[05:59] and Bitcoin which is a savings tool but
[06:01] because real estate is used as a savings
[06:04] tool Bitcoin as a near perfect savings
[06:06] tool is in direct competition with
[06:08] Bitcoin so that is why I started to
[06:11] combine the two fields of real estate
[06:14] and Bitcoin it's an interesting
[06:16] discussion I love chess Ma's uh chart
[06:18] also I had him on on the podcast it's
[06:20] really interesting also how he goes
[06:23] about and and finds the Bitcoin in value
[06:27] um when we compare now the huge real
[06:30] estate market what would you say I mean
[06:32] it's I don't know if it's possible to to
[06:35] to answer this but what would you say is
[06:37] there because it's used as a store of
[06:39] value and what is there because it's
[06:42] actually used as a house it's actually
[06:44] used as what real estate actually is so
[06:46] like what's the what's the monetary
[06:47] premium of of this real estate market uh
[06:50] so what's the potential for for Bitcoin
[06:52] to to to capture there yeah it's a good
[06:55] question I've been looking into it more
[06:57] recently and it's difficult to estimate
[07:00] but I'll will give some ideas so quickly
[07:02] to explain what the monetary premium is
[07:05] real estate has utility value as I just
[07:07] mentioned but people use it as a savings
[07:10] account as money money used to be a
[07:12] store of value before it was uh before
[07:14] the Fiat system basically so the
[07:16] monetary premium real estate really
[07:18] means it's used as money so how much of
[07:21] the value of real estate is attributable
[07:23] to its use as money and how much of it
[07:25] to its utility value and um I'll quickly
[07:29] run through some numbers here for the
[07:31] Munich real estate market I recently
[07:33] read a study that estimated that from
[07:37] 2008 until 2018 so 10 years 2008 until
[07:43] 2018 real estate prices in Munich
[07:46] tripled and that is because of the high
[07:48] rate of monetary inflation That central
[07:51] banks central banks used after the
[07:53] financial crisis 8 to basically um help
[07:56] the economy survive and a lot of that
[07:59] went into real estate so house prices
[08:02] tripled right so that doesn't really
[08:04] give us a number like the percentage
[08:06] number how much of the value of a house
[08:08] is it's used as money attributable to
[08:11] how high is the monetary premium but I'd
[08:14] say you know we could estimate anything
[08:16] between 40 to 70% but it's really hard
[08:19] to do that it's really hard to make an
[08:20] estimation you would have to look into
[08:22] it but you can make some estimations
[08:25] based on the following so before the
[08:27] Fiat standard before 19
[08:30] 71 when money was used as a store of
[08:33] value the cost of construction were
[08:36] mainly made up of um working
[08:39] force uh
[08:41] material and land right but they were
[08:44] almost equ equally distributable so a
[08:46] third was um craftsmanship or the work
[08:49] that went into the house about a third
[08:51] was material and a third the land and at
[08:54] this point of time the land is between
[08:56] 70 to 90% of the constru construction
[08:59] cost of a house so labor and material
[09:02] make up much less of the total cost of
[09:05] constructing a house and that kind of
[09:08] you know helps us to to understand how
[09:11] high the monetary premium is but to put
[09:13] a number on it is is very difficult
[09:15] because statistically it's difficult to
[09:16] estimate but we can see that the that
[09:19] land has become exponentially expensive
[09:22] whereas labor and construction cost have
[09:24] also become more expensive but um not as
[09:28] expensive it's really interesting for me
[09:31] because it sounds really weird when
[09:34] someone that is not into Bitcoin and you
[09:36] tell them yeah Bitcoin will make housing
[09:40] affordable it sounds like a weird
[09:42] argument but if you look at that and
[09:44] Bitcoin sucks up the uh monetary premium
[09:46] of real estate slowly and we get more
[09:49] efficient in producing houses and houses
[09:51] don't go up in value just because of
[09:52] store value this could
[09:54] actually um make housing way more
[09:58] affordable uh than it is now like it's
[10:01] now but more it's like the it was like
[10:03] 100 years ago or 200 years ago um where
[10:05] it was not that big of a chunk and with
[10:08] our technology advancement that that
[10:10] could be a huge steps for um living for
[10:14] for humans that's I think that's a
[10:17] underrated um aspect of of Bitcoin
[10:20] making other things cheaper or more
[10:23] affordable I like that aspect a lot of
[10:25] of of that yeah I agree with you I
[10:28] totally agree with you because because
[10:29] if you think about it uh in
[10:32] technology is deflationary meaning
[10:35] things get cheaper over time because we
[10:37] get better at producing things uh and
[10:40] the storage capacity of hardware for
[10:43] example also increases over time but the
[10:45] reason why things getting more expensive
[10:47] is because the monetary Supply increases
[10:50] with an increase in the monetary Supply
[10:52] individual units lose purchasing power
[10:54] and then people have to invest to
[10:56] outperform inflation which drives up the
[10:58] cost of housing for example and as you
[11:01] described housing will most likely
[11:03] become affordable uh for those who hold
[11:06] Bitcoin or already is for two reasons
[11:08] right if you hold Bitcoin if you hold
[11:11] Bitcoin housing is becoming more
[11:12] affordable because Bitcoin increases in
[11:15] purchasing power much faster than
[11:17] housing because it's scarer and as more
[11:20] people invest in Bitcoin we can we can
[11:23] we can project into the future that
[11:25] there will be less demand for Real
[11:27] Estate to outperform inflation
[11:29] which should also drive down the cost of
[11:32] housing but I want to make a point here
[11:34] because it sounds strange sometimes when
[11:37] I talk to people that are not into
[11:38] Bitcoin and I tell them Bitcoin is going
[11:40] to make housing affordable they just
[11:41] like shake their heads and they don't
[11:44] understand why and I think it's
[11:46] important to understand that in my
[11:48] opinion and I think that's a perspective
[11:50] that the austrians would take as well
[11:52] and Bitcoin as would take as well change
[11:55] starts with the individual right we
[11:57] cannot centrally centrally plan change
[12:00] change starts with the individual so in
[12:02] order for housing to become a more
[12:05] affordable the individual has to take
[12:07] action himself or herself and buy
[12:10] Bitcoin right to be able to afford more
[12:13] in the future because Bitcoin is
[12:15] disinflationary there's less new Supply
[12:18] over time and its purchasing power
[12:20] increases because demand for Bitcoin
[12:22] quite frankly increases because of its
[12:25] unique monetary properties and also
[12:27] because of Fiat inflation people always
[12:28] look
[12:29] to make a good investment and Bitcoin I
[12:32] think is the best investment that you
[12:33] can make absolutely um just a a small
[12:38] Sidetrack here you said you learn CLS in
[12:40] economics how did you break that that
[12:42] mindset that you learned and actually
[12:44] waken a little bit to to the Austrian
[12:47] economics and to the Bitcoin
[12:49] mindset yeah it wasn't easy to be honest
[12:52] with you so I I studied philosophy and
[12:55] ethics and business management so did
[12:57] two bachelors and always had an interest
[13:00] in in in philosophy and art but I also
[13:02] had an interest into economics and I
[13:04] think that my interest in philosophy
[13:06] helped me to Dish my Keynesian mindset
[13:09] because uh in philosophy at least how I
[13:12] approach philosophy I always go by my
[13:14] intuition because um sometimes you can
[13:17] logically deduct an argument or you can
[13:20] just pay attention to what intuitively
[13:22] feels right to you right and intuitively
[13:26] when I got into canes and economics and
[13:27] I went into the bottom of it it didn't
[13:30] feel right it just didn't feel right and
[13:34] uh and then I learned about Bitcoin and
[13:35] it just intuitively felt right but it
[13:39] took around I'd say five to six years to
[13:42] shed my Keynesian mindset and really
[13:44] open myself up to an Austrian
[13:46] perspective to the Austrian School the
[13:48] Austrian School of Economics H I do not
[13:51] believe that the Austrian School has
[13:53] answers to all the qu questions that
[13:55] exist but at least it's um uh has some
[13:58] guid principles that are um based um in
[14:03] Universal truths and what I mean by
[14:04] truth is there is no universal truth I
[14:06] mean I don't really believe there's an
[14:07] objective truth things are subjective
[14:10] values subjective and opinions are but
[14:13] at least there are some first principles
[14:16] that we can work on I give an example so
[14:19] in in 15 I think in 1570 kopernicus
[14:23] already proved the quantity theory of
[14:24] money and what he basically proved is if
[14:27] you increase the monetary Supply
[14:29] you don't do not increase wealth you
[14:32] decrease the purchasing power of
[14:34] outstanding units so it actually has a
[14:36] counter effect of whoever intended to
[14:39] increase the wealth by increasing the
[14:40] monetary Supply and that's something
[14:43] that was uh discovered 500 years ago and
[14:46] that's something that the austrians
[14:47] started to build on again and uh that's
[14:50] something that I like because I believe
[14:52] that we do not have to be Progressive we
[14:54] do not have to consistently find a new
[14:57] system we just have to understand how
[14:59] things worked in the past and then learn
[15:02] from the past um rather than trying to
[15:06] invent a new future so if you really
[15:08] think about it what Bitcoin does it
[15:10] takes us back to our things were
[15:13] thousands hundreds or maybe tens of
[15:15] thousands of years ago and um the
[15:18] Keynesian school is fairly new I mean
[15:20] Bitcoin follows Universal principles
[15:22] ttic principles that have been known to
[15:24] humanity for thousands of years and the
[15:26] Kian school of thought is fairly new it
[15:29] exists for less than a 100 years John
[15:31] mayad KES was a British Economist Who
[15:34] Rose to Fame in the
[15:36] 1930s and um is the founding father at
[15:40] least mentally of the existing Fiat
[15:42] system and it took me some time to open
[15:47] myself up to the possibility of finding
[15:50] a different economic principle but yeah
[15:55] it's interesting how uh this F is not
[15:58] that long here but it's so dominant if
[16:02] you look in all the universities when
[16:03] you look in uh what professors usually
[16:06] teach about what also of course from
[16:09] central banks and everything uh it
[16:11] trickles down why why do you think why
[16:13] do you think was K economics so uh
[16:16] successful in the last 100 years in uh
[16:18] not successful in in monetary terms but
[16:20] successful in in marketing I guess so in
[16:23] in in making it a dominant way to
[16:27] universities to C culs to to the
[16:30] schools it's it's difficult to answer
[16:33] but I I think it has to do with war and
[16:35] I I explain what I mean by that so in
[16:39] 1971 on the 15th of August 1971 the US
[16:43] president at the time Richard Nixon
[16:45] announced that the US would stop the
[16:47] convertibility of the dollar into gold
[16:49] at a fixed rate um and since
[16:52] 1944 the US and its allies established
[16:55] the Breton Woods agreement at the end of
[16:57] the second world war and it um linked
[17:00] the currencies of the LED Nations to the
[17:03] dollar and it linked the dollar to Gold
[17:05] so it was a quasy gold standard it
[17:07] wasn't a pure go gold standard but it
[17:09] was a quasi gold standard and then in
[17:11] 1971 why did the US go off the Quasi
[17:14] gold standard they did so in order to
[17:16] compete with the Soviet Union because
[17:18] the Soviet Union due to their monetary
[17:21] system was able to fund War like
[17:24] perpetually and the US was limited in
[17:27] funding War due to the Fiat system which
[17:30] limited the printing press but when Rich
[17:32] Richard Nixon announced that there would
[17:34] end the convertibility of the dollar
[17:36] into gold at a fixed rate it also
[17:38] allowed them to compete with the Soviet
[17:40] Union by funding War more extremely in
[17:44] Vietnam and in Afghanistan and other
[17:46] countries of the world so I think the
[17:48] competition between Nation States Nation
[17:51] States excuse me that always ends up in
[17:54] war favors the Fiat system because the
[17:56] Fiat system allows you to print money
[17:58] and Wars very costly so there's a link
[18:00] here I don't know if that explained your
[18:02] question but I believe that is the
[18:04] reason um because it basically helps
[18:07] nation states to perpetually fund war
[18:10] and compete with each other with a fake
[18:12] Advantage
[18:13] basically I hopefully that that will uh
[18:17] change
[18:18] once the concept you you probably have
[18:22] written the uh not written uh read the
[18:25] the sovereign individual uh and I'm a
[18:27] big fan of being more free of where you
[18:31] have been born and that it's it's more
[18:34] easily you can you can choose what what
[18:38] you want to be governed with like you
[18:39] can choose uh your services and and your
[18:43] things that you actually want to uh take
[18:46] advantage of when you look in into a
[18:48] state so what I mean by that is uh you
[18:51] as an individual are now born in like
[18:54] Austria uh and you have aition disadvan
[18:57] by that but what if you can just like
[19:00] choose oh no I don't want to be governed
[19:02] by the Austrian state but I want to be
[19:03] govern by something else that could be
[19:05] an interesting uh model to make this
[19:08] this War models those Kan and economics
[19:10] models um a little less relevant and I
[19:14] think Bitcoin might be the first step
[19:16] towards that future um but it's uh it
[19:19] will be a long time I mean the internet
[19:21] and remote work and all those things are
[19:24] another steps to towards that future and
[19:27] I hope that uh that that we come to that
[19:31] future where this makes more sense are
[19:34] you um a Sidetrack here but uh are you
[19:38] um not not really but happy to learn oh
[19:41] yeah it's just a plan B like the get
[19:45] getting a second passport or something
[19:46] like that I'm just like researching a
[19:48] little bit in that but let's come back
[19:50] to the real estate sorry for my small
[19:52] Sid track here um we you you mentioned
[19:55] before that we that real estate really
[19:57] um lost value when you compare it to
[20:00] Bitcoins like Bitcoin already made um
[20:03] housing way more affordable i s saw the
[20:05] numbers before the podcast again it was
[20:08] like 32 Bitcoin in the US average home
[20:11] uh five years ago now it's around like
[20:13] five six depending on what numbers
[20:15] you're looking at yeah uh how how do you
[20:18] think uh this will compare in in the
[20:21] future because I'm not a huge fan of of
[20:24] Bitcoin price predictions in us
[20:26] dollarars because it's like US dollars
[20:28] is like they can print and this can
[20:30] really mess up your models but housing
[20:33] is way more fixed you can way more
[20:36] predictable uh say like oh there will be
[20:39] so many houses in the world so there
[20:40] will be so many Bitcoins in the world in
[20:42] adoption rate and stuff like that how do
[20:43] you look like like a house prices in the
[20:46] future measured in Bitcoin uh 5 10 20
[20:50] years ago do you have some framework
[20:51] around that or is it something that
[20:53] you're not interested in no I am
[20:56] interested in that and I have a
[20:57] framework that I work with
[20:59] now basically like what you said because
[21:01] it's easy to give price predictions for
[21:03] Bitcoin going forward and I do that
[21:06] sometimes just to help people understand
[21:08] the um potential of Bitcoin within their
[21:11] mindset because they still use the
[21:13] dollar or the Euro as a unit of account
[21:17] but I think what's important to
[21:19] understand is that if we look at money
[21:21] money has different functions so first
[21:24] of all money needs to be a medium of
[21:25] exchange it needs to be something that
[21:27] we can use to buy goods and services and
[21:29] then the question is what is a good
[21:31] medium of exchange a good medium of
[21:33] exchange is a type of money that retains
[21:35] its value over time because otherwise
[21:39] nobody would accept that money for
[21:40] payment if they are forced legally of
[21:43] course they will but generally speaking
[21:45] they won't so money needs to be a good
[21:47] store of value and then thirdly money is
[21:49] a unit of account we can use money to
[21:51] measure things and if we use the dollar
[21:55] to measure a home it looks like the home
[21:58] is right in but it's actually only
[21:59] rising in nominal value almost on par
[22:02] with monetary inflation so as money
[22:04] enters the economy people invest in real
[22:06] estate and some of the money that enters
[22:08] the economy actually enters the real
[22:10] estate market through mortgages right
[22:12] but you have to change your mindset
[22:14] basically you have to change your unit
[22:15] of account the new unit of account that
[22:18] I personally use is Bitcoin or satoshis
[22:21] and it's repricing every asset in the
[22:23] world and if you price real estate and
[22:25] Bitcoin you can see how drastically
[22:28] real estate is falling in price when
[22:30] measured against Bitcoin and at some
[22:32] point in the future let's say you know
[22:36] uh we put out a hypothetical scenario in
[22:39] which hyperinflation meaning there will
[22:42] be inflation rates higher than 150% a
[22:45] month uh where feat currencies will have
[22:48] lost their purchasing power and then
[22:50] Bitcoin will not be priced and feared
[22:52] currencies but Bitcoin will be priced
[22:54] and whatever you can buy with Bitcoin so
[22:56] goods and services so it's some point in
[22:59] the future you will not say oh my house
[23:01] is worth $1 million and $1 million are X
[23:04] Bitcoin you will just say my house is
[23:06] worth one Bitcoin or my house is worth
[23:09] 0.1 Bitcoin and now to give an
[23:12] estimation how much should a house be
[23:15] worth difficult to say even uh on a
[23:19] Bitcoin standard so a standard where we
[23:21] have a fixed monetary Supply and people
[23:24] do not need to invest into scarse assets
[23:26] like real estate to to outperform
[23:28] inflation there's a high utility value
[23:31] in real estate right so real estate and
[23:33] Prime locations will still be very
[23:36] expensive and to give you a number is
[23:39] difficult but we could say you know
[23:41] right now you set a house cost around
[23:43] five Bitcoin I think an average home
[23:45] maybe in the future an average home will
[23:46] be less than 0.1 Bitcoin maybe it will
[23:49] be
[23:51] 0.055 Bitcoin um you can basically you
[23:54] can take all the Assets in the world and
[23:57] divide it by 21 1 million to basically
[23:59] get an idea of uh the potential price
[24:02] for certain goods and services that's a
[24:06] mental exercise that people can maybe do
[24:08] at home look at all the value in the
[24:10] world look at gold art stocks equities
[24:15] bonds and real estate um that's around
[24:18] 900 trillion divide that by 21 million
[24:21] see what that is for one Bitcoin and
[24:24] then look what a house is worth right
[24:27] now so I I'm assuming it's uh on the top
[24:30] of my head that should be one Bitcoin is
[24:32] over 20 million in that case right so um
[24:36] if if a house is worth 1 million now
[24:39] let's just say you said 500,000 but I'm
[24:41] just going to say 1 million for for the
[24:44] purpose of making it easier to calculate
[24:46] I could buy 20 houses with one Bitcoin
[24:49] so you see I mean the purchasing power
[24:51] of Bitcoin uh in the future of one
[24:54] Bitcoin of 100 million satosi it's going
[24:57] to me way higher than
[25:00] today I have one interesting model I I
[25:03] use Jesse Myers model uh and he I think
[25:08] in his estimation he used very
[25:10] conservatively uh that Bitcoin will
[25:13] consume 20% of the of the world's assets
[25:17] which I think is the kind of the the
[25:20] conservative really conservative case um
[25:22] and then I thought like okay what's the
[25:24] most bullish like if Bitcoin is is is
[25:27] the most successful in the world was the
[25:29] most bullish case for Bitcoin uh and I
[25:32] was going to uh 85% because I think they
[25:36] will always be value in other things uh
[25:38] in some things more and some things less
[25:41] uh but if if Bitcoin is the best store
[25:43] of value most people will hold almost
[25:47] all their wealth in Bitcoin and will not
[25:49] deal with the headaches of real estate
[25:51] will not deal with the headaches of
[25:52] owning an individual company and stuff
[25:54] like that so I think like 85 maybe it's
[25:56] 80 maybe it's 90 maybe it's 7
[25:58] is a good estimation and then you take
[26:01] Jesse Myers um
[26:04] model and then do it with 8 uh 58% of uh
[26:11] no 85% of of the whole total net assets
[26:14] and this divided then not by 21 million
[26:17] I used 15 million Bitcoin because I
[26:20] think there are a lot of Bitcoin lost
[26:21] and there might be more B Bitcoin loss
[26:23] in the future this brings you actually
[26:25] down to exactly um uh $50 million price
[26:30] per Bitcoin uh which is insane uh
[26:33] especially when you think of it's
[26:35] today's tallers terms like it's not
[26:39] there's inflation coming on top like
[26:40] that's because most people say like yeah
[26:42] but at that point 50 million will not be
[26:44] any worth anything yeah but 50 million
[26:46] in 10 years might be 500 million in in
[26:50] in in that term so uh that's for me the
[26:52] most bullish cares and that's what I
[26:55] usually try when when I think of like
[26:58] okay what's the most bullish case should
[27:00] I really focus on bitcoin yes I should
[27:02] focus on bitcoin because if it's
[27:03] successful it's it's super super super
[27:06] successful uh and in that case like you
[27:09] you can you can buy a lot of you can buy
[27:11] a lot of houses before Bitcoin uh even
[27:13] like good houses like one million uh
[27:16] dollars is is not a bad house it's not a
[27:18] massively good house in a massively good
[27:21] area but it's already a good house so I
[27:23] I like the way you think and I think we
[27:26] we kind of like have the the same
[27:27] direction what what do you think of the
[27:29] 85% is that something that seems
[27:32] realistic or would you say other other
[27:36] estimations yeah no I mean your
[27:38] calculation is correct I was just making
[27:39] estimations but um you were your
[27:42] calculation is obviously more precise
[27:43] and it's actually correct because Jesse
[27:45] also makes the case I think I think he
[27:47] says there's 900 trillion assets if 200
[27:51] trillion of that will be put into
[27:52] Bitcoin then he says 21 million Bitcoin
[27:55] is the number we should divide it by but
[27:57] you are actually correct many of the
[27:58] Bitcoins have been lost so it's actually
[28:00] less but he divides it by I think 21
[28:02] million and he says $10 million per
[28:04] Bitcoin and you actually say let's take
[28:06] 85% of that um so a $50 million um
[28:10] bitcoin price Target is um is realistic
[28:14] when you think what could buy you 50
[28:16] million today so instead of thinking one
[28:19] Bitcoin equals 50 million that's
[28:21] completely crazy you should think what
[28:24] goods and services can be bought today
[28:26] with $50 million
[28:28] and then take that basket of goods and
[28:30] services and say I can buy these goods
[28:33] and Serv services with one Bitcoin in
[28:35] the future so you take away the nominal
[28:37] value because fiat currency is
[28:40] consistently being inflated so when we
[28:42] say one Bitcoin will be worth 50 million
[28:46] that sounds completely crazy but
[28:47] obviously at that point of time 50
[28:49] million will be not what 50 million are
[28:51] today and I like the idea of looking at
[28:55] what goods and services can be bought in
[28:58] the future with Bitcoin rather than
[29:00] saying or what amount of goods and
[29:03] services can be bought with Bitcoin in
[29:05] the future rather than saying one
[29:08] Bitcoin will be worth x amount of fiat
[29:11] currency because fiat currency in the
[29:13] future will have little meaning because
[29:16] things will be repriced in Bitcoin right
[29:19] so in the future if I want to sell my
[29:21] house I'm not going to ask for fiat
[29:24] currency I'm going to ask for Bitcoin
[29:26] when I say in the future
[29:28] I'm really making a hypothetical example
[29:30] here of decades into the future because
[29:33] I think for the coming upcoming decades
[29:35] let's say the upcoming 20 or 30 years
[29:39] the Fiat system will prevail I think um
[29:44] the money printer can go on for longer
[29:46] than we hope so um there will be a
[29:49] parallel system a Bitcoin economy and a
[29:52] feat economy alongside each other for
[29:55] the foreseeable future and the Bitcoin
[29:57] economy is going to grow very very fast
[30:00] um in purchasing power whereas the Fiat
[30:04] uh economy will lose purchasing power
[30:06] rapidly and also exponentially so if you
[30:08] work in real estate and maybe that's
[30:10] something you also wanted to discuss
[30:11] today um just be aware that the
[30:14] speculation that is happening in real
[30:16] estate will most likely move over to
[30:18] bitcoin and real estate will collapse to
[30:20] its utility value but this does not mean
[30:23] that people do not need a space to live
[30:26] or work in so real estate as a business
[30:29] and real estate as a service will remain
[30:31] important right you offer a service to
[30:33] the market housing an event space uh
[30:37] production facility and you receive rent
[30:40] in return and I think that's important
[30:41] to understand that once the speculation
[30:44] that is happening in real estate has
[30:45] moved over to bitcoin and real estate
[30:48] will be priced based on its utility
[30:50] value it's important to think about okay
[30:53] what happens then how do I deal with it
[30:55] how do I deal with the transition phase
[30:57] if I run a real estate business you know
[30:59] how do I manage my debt structure how do
[31:02] I manage my maintenance reserves how do
[31:05] I utilize Bitcoin you could also I was
[31:07] just today I was talking with Lucas of
[31:10] 21 energy and I've been going around
[31:13] this Rabbit Hole of combining uh Bitcoin
[31:16] mining with real estate because if you
[31:18] think about it it's very energy intense
[31:20] to maintain real estate and energy cost
[31:23] at the moment uh are quite high as well
[31:26] and uh Computing generates heat right so
[31:29] there's a byproduct of mining which is
[31:31] heat and that can be used that can be
[31:34] used with in physical structures that
[31:36] can be used to heat a room it can be
[31:38] used to heat water it can be used in
[31:41] industrial plants and it can also be
[31:44] combined with solar so in Germany
[31:46] there's no regulation that you need to
[31:48] have solar on your roof if you have if
[31:51] you build a new apartment block but the
[31:54] problem with that is uh in the city of
[31:56] Hamburg for example we have on 15%
[31:59] sunlight throughout the year so that
[32:01] makes it very difficult to um run a
[32:04] solar uh construction on your roof
[32:07] profitable and also once you have excess
[32:10] solar it's sometimes difficult to sell
[32:11] it to the grid because sometimes the
[32:13] grid has over capacity you can't sell
[32:16] your energy to the grid and Bitcoin
[32:18] mining can serve as an economic battery
[32:20] here where you at the point where you
[32:23] cannot sell the energy to the grid you
[32:25] mine Bitcoin which also helps you to um
[32:30] be profitably quicker it can take up to
[32:33] seven years until solar or wind
[32:36] construction is profitable but if you
[32:38] combine it with Bitcoin mining it can be
[32:40] profitable after two or three years so
[32:42] that's pretty interesting so I think the
[32:44] the the merge of Bitcoin mining into
[32:48] physical infrastructures is something
[32:50] that we will see going forward and uh I
[32:53] can also imagine that a lot of the hash
[32:56] rate a lot of the um
[32:58] energy a lot of the electricity that's
[33:00] get gets feed into the Bitcoin Network
[33:02] in the future will not be provided by
[33:04] companies that focus on Bitcoin mining
[33:06] but it will be provided by energy
[33:08] companies that use Bitcoin mining as an
[33:11] economic battery to feed in Surplus
[33:13] energy that is not needed at the point
[33:16] of its production that is true for
[33:17] solodar and wind but it's also true for
[33:20] oil because if you drill oil what
[33:22] happens is that gas methan gas is being
[33:25] released and people just burn it they
[33:26] just flare it but you can obviously use
[33:29] Bitcoin mining to utilize that energy
[33:32] that's already being done in in Texas
[33:34] and and other states in the US
[33:36] predominantly but I can imagine that
[33:38] being done uh all over the world and now
[33:41] as a real estate developer we are
[33:42] looking into how can we combine Bitcoin
[33:45] mining um into um real estate
[33:48] development and how can we use Bitcoin
[33:50] mining to provide heat into the physical
[33:53] infrastructure that is the property that
[33:56] we manage if you watch my podcast
[33:58] already for more than two times you know
[34:00] how extremely passionate I am about
[34:03] self- custody and the first very very
[34:06] very important step to self cust is
[34:09] always getting yourself a hardware
[34:13] wallet and I have one for you here this
[34:15] is the Bitcoin only Edition from the
[34:17] bitbox my favorite single signature
[34:20] Hardware wallet on the market another
[34:23] really important piece of self- custody
[34:26] if you have a hardware wallet is the
[34:28] backup of the seat phrase and bitbox
[34:30] made the perfect solution to back up
[34:33] your seat phrase they made a reusable
[34:36] steel wallet check out that beauty it's
[34:39] durable and extremely heavy if I put it
[34:42] on the desk I seriously feel for my own
[34:45] table it's so so heavy and durable I
[34:48] love it this is where my seed phrase is
[34:52] secure go to bitbox
[34:54] do/ robobin to get your bitbox box and
[34:58] if you use code Robin you even get 5%
[35:02] off of your complete order and the next
[35:05] step is to really level up your
[35:07] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[35:10] have the most secure self- custody setup
[35:13] you have to secure your own devices you
[35:16] have to protect your privacy you have to
[35:18] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[35:21] on where you live you even want to have
[35:23] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[35:26] move in case some something goes really
[35:28] really wrong and through all those steps
[35:30] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[35:33] step by step and if you visit the
[35:35] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[35:39] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[35:42] out how you can level up your
[35:44] sovereignty and last but not least I
[35:47] have something completely new for you
[35:49] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[35:53] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[35:56] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[35:59] look at that beauty I love it so much
[36:01] coin vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin
[36:05] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[36:08] way to go out there and show that you
[36:10] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[36:13] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[36:16] dropped a completely new and amazing
[36:19] Genesis edition of their watch
[36:22] collections you have the date of the
[36:24] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[36:28] and of course also the block height and
[36:30] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[36:34] level of detail they put in in this
[36:36] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[36:38] those amazing coin vilante time pieces
[36:42] down in the descriptions I love those
[36:44] watches so so much that's really
[36:47] interesting um using Bitcoin as a as an
[36:51] feature for for Real Estate basically
[36:54] you you mentioned one thing now with
[36:55] with uh Bitcoin mining in uh real estate
[36:59] facilities which is an amazing thing I
[37:01] also see people actually using the heat
[37:03] of Bitcoin miners to warm up their pools
[37:06] or whatever which is an interesting uh
[37:09] thing or just warm up the the water in
[37:11] general um how else can Real Estate
[37:14] Investors or real estate developers uh
[37:17] consider Bitcoin and integrate Bitcoin
[37:19] in their strategies yeah um so I'll
[37:23] start with um something very simple
[37:26] something very simple is that you can
[37:27] can use a service like relay to build
[37:30] maintenance reserves in Bitcoin so you
[37:32] can look at your cash flow the monthly
[37:34] income that you make from rents that you
[37:37] receive and you can allocate a
[37:39] percentage of that um towards buying
[37:42] Bitcoin you can say I take at say like I
[37:44] don't know I'll throw out a number here
[37:46] 10% or
[37:47] 15% 20% is also fine but you don't want
[37:50] to drain your cash flow if you are still
[37:52] repaying thatb that you took on to
[37:55] construct the property but you can take
[37:57] to 20% of your rental income and just
[37:59] buy Bitcoin with it and it's important
[38:02] to hold it for a minimum of four years
[38:05] that is a Haring cycle in Bitcoin so
[38:07] Bitcoin goes through these cycles of
[38:09] bull and bare markets and
[38:11] usually after the Bitcoin Haring which
[38:13] is an event that cuts the block reward
[38:16] that is being distributed to whoever
[38:18] successfully adds a block to the Bitcoin
[38:20] chime chain and that also includes
[38:23] transaction fees and that is being have
[38:26] every four years to decrease the supply
[38:28] until 2,140 when the last Satoshi will
[38:32] be mined and after that after the Haring
[38:36] event usually Bitcoin goes through bull
[38:38] market because with less uh supply and
[38:41] demand that is consistent or potentially
[38:44] increasing due to more fiat currency
[38:46] being available or the need to protect
[38:48] savings Bitcoin increases in price so
[38:51] you need to have at least a 4-year
[38:53] minimum holding period ideally longer
[38:57] ideally much longer so ideally 10 20 or
[38:59] 30 years as a holding period and then um
[39:03] something I would also suggest is what
[39:05] real estate developers usually do as the
[39:08] gap between the debt that is on the
[39:12] property and its value increases right
[39:15] say let's say a real estate house or
[39:17] real estate project a property is worth
[39:20] a million dollars I don't know and you
[39:22] took out a loan for I'd say 800,000
[39:26] right to construct it you had 200,000 uh
[39:28] of your own money Equity then it's
[39:30] finished it's worth a million dollars
[39:32] and then after five years it's worth 1.2
[39:35] million and you already paid some of the
[39:38] debt back you can refinance the existing
[39:41] debt that sits on the property and you
[39:44] use that money for whatever you wish
[39:46] usually what people do they um buy more
[39:49] real estate but I suggest buy some
[39:51] Bitcoin so refinance the existing
[39:54] portfolios that you hold to buy Bitcoin
[39:56] and you basically copy M saor by doing
[39:59] this right what is Mich saor doing he
[40:01] has a company that has income he takes
[40:04] debt against the future income of that
[40:06] company and he buys Bitcoin with it
[40:08] right and as a real estate uh owner as a
[40:11] real estate developer that manages its
[40:14] own properties you can do that as well
[40:17] and something I'd like to suggest that's
[40:19] something I've been talking about quite
[40:20] a lot recently is um I believe that if
[40:23] you construct real estate right I would
[40:26] suggest to take out a loan that includes
[40:29] Bitcoin so instead of taking on a a loan
[40:33] of $1 million take out a loan of 1
[40:37] million uh 100,000 you take the 1
[40:40] million and you direct it to
[40:42] constructing the property as you usually
[40:43] would you take 100,000 extra and you buy
[40:46] Bitcoin with it and you hold it in the
[40:49] same entity that holds the real estate
[40:51] project by doing that you hatch yourself
[40:54] against the scenario where the monetary
[40:57] premium that sits in real estate flows
[41:00] into Bitcoin right and you also profit
[41:03] from
[41:04] Bitcoins exponential increase in
[41:07] purchasing power and you can use Bitcoin
[41:10] in your company structure as a capital
[41:12] base that's growing in purchasing sorry
[41:15] in purchasing power to lend against to
[41:17] then maintain your property right so the
[41:20] integration of Bitcoin into real estate
[41:23] has different stages maintenance
[41:26] reserves refund financing and including
[41:28] it in financing generally speaking and I
[41:31] believe it's going to revolutionize the
[41:33] real estate sector very similar to how
[41:35] e-commerce revolutionized retail so you
[41:38] know in in the late 90s if you would
[41:40] have told somebody that owns a
[41:42] successful retail store on a High Street
[41:44] anywhere in the world to open up a
[41:46] website they probably would have thought
[41:49] that you are talking gibberish right
[41:51] they would not have been able most
[41:53] likely to see the need of doing that and
[41:57] I think it is important if you are in
[42:00] real estate to adopt Bitcoin strategies
[42:02] because Bitcoin is digital Capital it's
[42:04] a digital store of value and is going to
[42:07] disrupt the real estate industry similar
[42:10] to how the retail industry disrupted uh
[42:14] sorry similar to how e-commerce
[42:16] disrupted the real uh retail industry Ah
[42:19] that's really interesting do you think
[42:21] that Bitcoin will also be used in the
[42:24] same way as real EST that with with
[42:25] collateral that be people just use their
[42:28] own uh Bitcoin to to use it as a
[42:30] collateral and then refinance things and
[42:32] stuff like that is is that a future you
[42:34] see yeah I do I do I do I do think so
[42:37] but I want to make a disclaimer here so
[42:39] um I'm going to give an extended answer
[42:41] and um I like that question that you
[42:44] just asked because um real estate is not
[42:47] just the number one store of value in
[42:49] the world it is also the number one type
[42:52] of collateral that is accepted by by
[42:54] Banks or financial institutions to give
[42:56] out a loan and Bitcoin actually is
[42:58] pristine collateral for Lending because
[43:01] it increases in purchasing power over
[43:03] time and if you lend against any type of
[43:06] collateral you want to own a collateral
[43:07] that increases in purchasing power over
[43:09] time so the LTV ratio loan to value
[43:12] ratio decreases over time but I have to
[43:15] make a disclaimer that's the following
[43:17] if you give a bank your Bitcoin to get
[43:20] Fiat credit right you are that's that's
[43:23] high risk why is it a high risk because
[43:26] you potentially could lose out on the
[43:27] Bitcoin if you lose Bitcoin you lose out
[43:30] on the future increase in purchasing
[43:32] power of that Bitcoin so there's a
[43:33] higher risk involved so I believe you
[43:36] should only take out the loan against
[43:37] your Bitcoin if you have a multi sick
[43:39] setup where you still possess the
[43:41] Bitcoin that you lend against because
[43:43] otherwise the risk of losing your
[43:45] Bitcoin do not really justify getting
[43:48] fiat currency in return and um yeah so
[43:53] therefore the ability to secure Bitcoin
[43:56] in a multi setup with a lender is very
[43:59] very important and I also want
[44:01] to um say something about the potential
[44:05] benefits of Bitcoin not just for the
[44:07] borrower because for the borrower it's
[44:09] very clear as long as Bitcoin increases
[44:12] in purchasing power faster than Fiat
[44:14] interest rates it makes sense to borrow
[44:16] against your Bitcoin and spend that fiat
[44:18] currency because the increase in
[44:20] purchasing power will outrun the
[44:23] interest rates right but only do that if
[44:25] you can secure Bitcoin and a multi
[44:27] signature setup and for the lender I
[44:29] think if you give out a credit line you
[44:32] can basically hatch yourself against the
[44:34] default of that credit line by forcing
[44:37] or requiring the borrower to buy Bitcoin
[44:40] as well because let's say Robin you want
[44:43] to start a business and I give you a
[44:45] credit line but I ask you to buy Bitcoin
[44:47] as well and you and me we hold it
[44:49] together in a multi um custodial setup
[44:53] if you go bankrupt if your business goes
[44:55] bankrupt and you default on the loan I
[44:57] still have the Bitcoin that I gave you
[44:59] so that basically is a hatch against
[45:01] borrow default and that's why I believe
[45:03] that Bitcoin will become an integrate or
[45:05] will be integrated into credit markets
[45:07] generally speaking because there are
[45:09] many benefits for the borrower yes but
[45:11] there are also many benefits for the
[45:14] lender and I think that's particularly
[45:16] interesting so if I would be a bank I
[45:18] would include Bitcoin into all credit
[45:20] products that I give out that that would
[45:23] be a huge step for when when Banks all
[45:25] of the sudden say to every customer
[45:27] yeah but you have to buy Bitcoin
[45:29] also that would be I think that would
[45:32] trigger some some some nice news but I
[45:35] it it makes sense like from a first
[45:36] principal standpoint if you are a bank
[45:39] and you want to land out money or you
[45:41] want to borrow money whatever your
[45:43] situation is it makes for both actually
[45:45] sense to have some Bitcoin as a reserve
[45:48] for for defaulting I like that idea I
[45:51] never heard that idea actually before
[45:53] from anyone like and that's that's
[45:54] really interesting as I you
[45:58] 260th Bitcoin podcast so it takes a
[46:00] little bit to to tell me something
[46:02] completely new but I like that idea a
[46:04] lot I that's that's an cool idea one
[46:07] thing I also wanted to bring up from our
[46:09] discussion before I forgot to mention it
[46:12] um I like the idea of pricing Bitcoin in
[46:15] Gold uh and and when you look now at the
[46:18] gold price it's around like 76 or
[46:22] 78,000 US Dollars and Bitcoin is at uh
[46:26] around about
[46:28] 65,000 US Dollars uh gold price for one
[46:32] kilogram I should say uh so it's it's
[46:34] right around the same number so uh I
[46:37] like to like the idea also of of pricing
[46:40] uh Bitcoin in like how many Bitcoin do
[46:42] you need for for buying one kilogram of
[46:44] gold I think that that should that
[46:46] should have been the the the number we
[46:49] actually should should focus on but I
[46:51] just wanted to to um note that from from
[46:54] earlier I think that's a that's an
[46:56] interesting way to think about and and
[46:58] pricing Bitcoin really cool what you
[47:00] also think about um real estate one
[47:02] question I always have when when I talk
[47:04] with real estate people um once you
[47:07] really get
[47:08] Bitcoin why would you do anything with
[47:11] real estate to begin with like why would
[47:14] you put any money uh in in in into real
[47:17] estate developments why not just shift
[47:20] everything uh you have into Bitcoin I
[47:22] mean I have had some Real Estate
[47:24] Investors especially uh on the show that
[47:28] actually went completely into Bitcoin
[47:30] and they also explained like how long it
[47:34] took to to to sell all those houses and
[47:36] stuff like that is there an argument to
[47:37] be made if you're real ested investor uh
[47:40] not a developer then it's like a
[47:42] business is not really an investment
[47:44] then uh do to still invest in in real
[47:46] estate or is the how do you see that
[47:49] topic no in my opinion there's not
[47:52] there's no point to invest in real
[47:53] estate I mean uh it's just I don't want
[47:56] to insult anyone so I was just about to
[47:58] say it's a foolish idea if you can think
[48:01] you can outperform Bitcoin and I'd like
[48:02] to propose a mental exercise there's a
[48:05] uh there's a cool website I think it's
[48:07] called Bitcoin compounding tocom and
[48:10] there's a guy he uh he made um basically
[48:14] a model um the Bitcoin fire calculator
[48:17] so if you Google the Bitcoin fire
[48:19] calculator uh just it should come up the
[48:22] website should come up and it basically
[48:24] there's six different models with
[48:26] different keggers with different
[48:28] compound annual growth rates exactly so
[48:31] um if you look at the compound annual
[48:32] growth rates here and we take model
[48:34] three so model 3 is fairly
[48:37] conservative and IT projects that the
[48:39] compound annual growth rate of Bitcoin
[48:41] going forward will be around
[48:44] 35% so in the past four years it was
[48:47] around 55% something like that there are
[48:51] different estimates depending when do
[48:52] you start uh in what year and what month
[48:54] and so forth but I do like model 3
[48:57] because it's fairly conservative and if
[48:59] you believe you can
[49:01] outperform these year on-year growth
[49:03] rates over the long term with any asset
[49:06] it's just foolish because mathematically
[49:08] speaking you just can't you just can't
[49:11] even if real estate is bought on
[49:12] Leverage because real estate becomes
[49:15] interesting if you buy it on Leverage
[49:17] without leverage real estate is not
[49:18] interesting if you buy it on Leverage it
[49:20] becomes interesting because um you
[49:23] borrow the money right and you buy an
[49:24] asset that you were not able to buy
[49:26] beforehand but even if you buy it on
[49:27] Leverage you cannot outperform Bitcoin
[49:30] so to invest in real estate to
[49:31] outperform bitcoin is quite frankly a
[49:34] bit of a foolish idea but real estate
[49:37] development and you made that
[49:38] distinction as well you made the
[49:39] distinction between real estate
[49:40] investing and real estate development
[49:42] and I'd like to make that distinction as
[49:44] well because I would consider myself a
[49:45] real estate developer I don't invest in
[49:48] real estate I invest all my savings and
[49:51] all my personal money into Bitcoin but I
[49:53] work in a real estate company and uh I
[49:56] help to build that company as an
[49:58] employee and that company has existed
[50:00] since 2015 and that company has projects
[50:04] that have to be run for the next 10
[50:06] years and debt has to be repaid so I
[50:09] cannot just stop and say guys I'm out
[50:11] right so I understand there's a paradigm
[50:14] shift going on but I also understand
[50:16] that I have
[50:18] um um yeah maybe it's it's it's it's up
[50:21] to me and it's my job to help the people
[50:23] around me understand what is happening
[50:25] and help them utilize Bitcoin because
[50:27] the people that I work with they would
[50:29] also consider themselves real estate
[50:31] developers because I have some internal
[50:33] discussions within the company and
[50:35] everybody that works within the company
[50:37] works there because they like the
[50:39] building environment they don't invest
[50:40] into real estate because they're Real
[50:42] Estate Investors they invest into real
[50:44] estate because they like the building
[50:46] environment they either are Architects
[50:48] or they're just they just generally like
[50:50] um to be real estate entrepreneurs right
[50:52] they like the real estate business and I
[50:55] think going forward we'd have to think
[50:56] of real estate more of a business where
[50:58] the way we think about real estate now
[51:00] is quite frankly we think of it as a
[51:02] financial asset because it has been
[51:04] priced away from its utility value
[51:06] because it is used as a store value to
[51:08] outperform inflation but um um the
[51:11] financial aspect of real estate will
[51:13] most likely fade away over time and real
[51:16] estate will go back to being a business
[51:19] and the real estate business is an
[51:21] interesting business right I mean you
[51:22] get rent cash flow is always nice and if
[51:25] you combine it with Bitcoin it can be an
[51:27] interesting business but I do believe
[51:29] the focus at this point in time for any
[51:32] investor in the world should be
[51:34] Bitcoin I like that fire calculator a
[51:36] lot I never saw it I I will play with
[51:39] that a lot it's pretty good it's if yeah
[51:41] it's pretty good if you have a hard time
[51:43] and you think oh things don't work out
[51:45] you can put in your stack there and
[51:47] project it into the future and you're
[51:48] like oh things are
[51:50] good maybe I'll make a video around that
[51:52] I think it's a people are really
[51:54] interested in like when do you retire on
[51:56] on your Bitcoin stack and stuff like
[51:58] that I think it actually makes nice
[52:00] calculation you can put in like a
[52:02] targeted stack when you want to retire
[52:05] basically when you want to do you want
[52:06] to withdraw do you want to have a fixed
[52:10] dollar amount to withdraw from it like
[52:12] it's it's an interesting um website I
[52:15] learn a lot of new things today really
[52:17] really cool um is there anything else uh
[52:20] that I forgot about real estate to ask
[52:23] is there anything else that you really
[52:24] want to to mention here in in the real
[52:27] estate uh discussion with Bitcoin no I
[52:30] there there's nothing to add uh if I do
[52:32] have something to add or comment uh on
[52:34] under our podcast if there's anything
[52:36] that comes to my mind at this point
[52:38] there there's nothing but I enjoy the
[52:40] conversation really really cool thank
[52:42] you I I sometimes especially with with
[52:45] with uh topics that I'm not so familiar
[52:47] with as as real estate I'm I don't know
[52:50] a lot of but real estate I always want
[52:52] to make sure I I covered everything so
[52:54] that's uh why I asked that question
[52:57] um now we come to the end of the podcast
[52:59] where I have one question is always the
[53:01] same question for every guest and one
[53:03] question that is um coming from the the
[53:06] previous guest the one question is
[53:07] always the same question for every guest
[53:09] is what can we learn from you uh besides
[53:13] Bitcoin and real estate what the I I
[53:16] don't really know um I'm still learning
[53:18] myself I mean I I decided to be a
[53:21] student not a teacher so um I'm not sure
[53:25] what you can learn of me but I'm try
[53:27] like I have a newsletter that that just
[53:29] like to share if you go on Leon v.s
[53:32] sub.com I have a newsletter where I
[53:35] share uh my thought process I write
[53:38] about Bitcoin and real estate but not
[53:39] only I started writing about Bitcoin and
[53:42] philosophy years ago before I got into
[53:44] Bitcoin and real estate um so I'm not
[53:47] only interested in Bitcoin and real
[53:48] estate I'm really interested in
[53:49] philosophy and ethics as well um I also
[53:53] I write about spirituality spiritual
[53:55] practice uh meditation and some of my
[53:58] routines that I use um to be focused on
[54:02] um you know being an investor in a
[54:04] Bitcoin space but at the same time also
[54:06] have enough time that I can allocate to
[54:08] let's say my spiritual
[54:09] practice um so if you're interested um
[54:12] and in my thoughts you can follow my
[54:15] substack yeah is is
[54:18] the has Bitcoin an impact on philosophy
[54:22] uh in in the general Society do you
[54:23] think the ethics and and philosophy
[54:26] might actually be uh influenced by sound
[54:29] money I think will'll be revolutionized
[54:31] maybe because right now you can just say
[54:34] things you can say you know
[54:35] postmodernism post constructural ISM you
[54:38] can just say everything that we knew so
[54:40] far doesn't count everything's different
[54:42] and you can construct these dystopian or
[54:45] utopian realities and quite frankly the
[54:48] last I'd say 60 70 years um you had that
[54:53] as a trend and I think it's it's
[54:55] connected to the Fiat world because the
[54:59] Fiat system does not work but people
[55:01] don't see it because money the money
[55:03] supply is consistently being increased
[55:06] for so the system can perpetually exist
[55:10] but the system by itself is actually
[55:12] sick it's like a sick haran patient that
[55:15] you give uh metad I think metad it's
[55:18] like uh what you give haran patients
[55:20] instead of Haring but it doesn't mean
[55:22] that these people are not sick anymore
[55:24] and just because there's more money
[55:25] funneled into the system does not mean
[55:27] that the system works well but people
[55:29] think the system works well and based on
[55:31] that they then assume what will happen
[55:33] in the future so a lot of the
[55:35] philosophical thoughts and a lot of the
[55:37] ethical thoughts that are very relevant
[55:40] or pre- relevant today actually don't
[55:42] make sense and I think Bitcoin exposes
[55:45] that Bitcoin if you you cannot
[55:47] in Bitcoin because if you lose your
[55:50] Bitcoin Bitcoin are gone the Bitcoin are
[55:52] gone you need to be self- responsible
[55:54] and I think self responsibility in the
[55:56] individual should lie at the center of
[55:59] any society and that's that was the case
[56:02] in the past and it's not the case
[56:03] anymore we have all these Collective
[56:06] ideas whatever you want to call it I
[56:08] don't even want to give them names
[56:09] because I don't want to bash anyone but
[56:12] uh the individual I think is in the
[56:14] center of um of of of existence and
[56:19] Bitcoin can help to take bullshitters
[56:22] basically the platform because right now
[56:25] in po politics and in philosophy and and
[56:28] mainstream media you have people that
[56:31] are bullshitting right but they are
[56:34] bullshitting because they're in a system
[56:36] where bullshitters are not penalized for
[56:39] um for their behavior and that's and I
[56:41] believe that Bitcoin can bring our can
[56:45] give our ideas a more realistic base a
[56:47] more realistic
[56:49] footing really really cool I love it a
[56:51] lot and we have the endro also where the
[56:54] previous guest is asking a question for
[56:55] next guest
[56:56] and this I think it's it's very suiting
[56:59] it's it's a almost a philosophical
[57:01] question um what have you done today
[57:04] which will make you a better human
[57:06] tomorrow actually I took some time this
[57:09] morning I had a very busy week and I was
[57:11] just going through appointments B and
[57:14] this morning I took like two two hours
[57:17] off I didn't pay attention my phone I
[57:19] just went
[57:21] inside and I think it's important to go
[57:24] inside because with everything that's
[57:25] happening in the world people tend to go
[57:27] outside and they tend to blame other
[57:29] people for whatever is happening and I
[57:31] do that sometimes as well I become
[57:33] resentful and politicized whenever I
[57:36] take the time to go inside I start to
[57:39] forgive and I start to focus on myself
[57:42] rather than making other people
[57:43] responsible for failures that I am
[57:46] responsible for I I start to take self
[57:49] responsibility and I think it's
[57:50] important to take self responsibility
[57:52] for mistakes that we made and I think
[57:54] that's something that I tried at least
[57:56] this morning really cool thank you for
[57:58] sharing this with us uh also thank you
[58:00] so much for for taking the time um you
[58:02] already mentioned your newsletter is
[58:04] there any other way people can reach out
[58:06] to you and find you on Nostra I really
[58:09] like Nostra I could talk a lot about
[58:11] Nostra as well and I think the
[58:13] importance of having uh a protocol for
[58:15] decentralized information exchange that
[58:17] cannot be censored or stopped so you can
[58:19] find me on Nostra uh at Leon vanum
[58:23] that's the same um tag you can find me
[58:25] on x but um Nostra just feels a bit more
[58:28] personal but the notes that I share on
[58:30] Nostra are a bit more personal whereas X
[58:32] is more business focused oh interesting
[58:36] uh I'm also since I think two weeks on
[58:39] Nostra
[58:40] actively and and I like it a lot it has
[58:43] some good future I mean it's it's still
[58:45] in the very early days it feels like I
[58:47] think Jack doy even uh posted it I think
[58:50] it feels like Twitter in the very very
[58:52] early days uh and it's an interesting uh
[58:55] thing to have yeah thank you so much for
[58:57] for being on Leon also thank you so much
[58:58] for everyone that is watching and
[59:00] listening uh for joining us today as
[59:02] always I'll be back tomorrow with
[59:03] another episode bye-bye
[59:06] [Music]
