[00:00] governments are paying attention to what
[00:01] Trump's doing we are going to start
[00:03] hearing more about other governments
[00:05] adopting Bitcoin or stockpiling Bitcoin
[00:08] my dream for mining is that it becomes
[00:11] integrated into the household in like a
[00:14] very natural way if you self custody and
[00:16] run your own node to me your Bitcoin
[00:18] spend Bitcoin when you can find
[00:20] businesses in your area that accept
[00:22] Bitcoin and make a point to support them
[00:25] using Bitcoin that would be my wish for
[00:27] every bitcoiner use it spend it a little
[00:29] bit you know you can spend in a place
[00:31] you have this savings that you've worked
[00:33] for and stored your time and energy into
[00:36] a better money but if you have that
[00:38] better money at some point you need to
[00:40] use that Bitcoin doesn't move and just
[00:42] sits in Black Rock's fault or with
[00:44] coinbase prime to me that's just not
[00:47] [Music]
[00:51] interesting you are in touch with a lot
[00:53] of people uh and you do a lot of great
[00:55] work at Bitcoin magazine um just so that
[00:58] people get to know you before we get get
[01:00] started in the in the in the topics uh
[01:02] what are you doing at Bitcoin magazine
[01:03] uh content and programming uh in that
[01:06] direction right yes so I first started
[01:09] with Bitcoin magazine in 22 uh as a an
[01:13] editor I was a junior editor working on
[01:15] the media side of things so we had a ton
[01:17] of Articles coming in from plebs all
[01:19] over who would submit an article and I
[01:21] would edit it and then publish it online
[01:23] and actually that's how I got my start
[01:25] in the Bitcoin industry I was writing
[01:26] articles for Bitcoin magazine and then I
[01:28] got hired on to help with the content
[01:31] and then from there I moved over to the
[01:34] conference side of things so right
[01:36] before Bitcoin Amsterdam in 2023 I
[01:39] started working on the programming with
[01:41] that team and really inviting the
[01:43] speakers and uh coordinating the panels
[01:47] and talks and things like that all the
[01:48] scheduling all the communication with
[01:50] those folks and um I've been doing that
[01:53] since 2023 so um in 24 we had uh a Hong
[01:58] Kong event we had our our Nashville
[02:01] event with uh many big speakers it's
[02:04] biggest Bitcoin event in the world we
[02:06] all had our Amsterdam event and then
[02:07] most recently we had an event in Abu
[02:09] Dhabi uh Bitcoin
[02:11] Mina and that's super interesting and
[02:13] you are just for the for the listeners
[02:16] knowing you're the first person that put
[02:18] me on a stage so you gambled you gambled
[02:20] on me that I can speak also not just on
[02:23] a podcast but also on stage so thank you
[02:25] so much for that that you put the trust
[02:27] in me that that is something that I
[02:29] really uh appreciate that because I
[02:32] literally and I told this I think on the
[02:34] podcast uh before that point where uh
[02:38] you were the person that I was in
[02:39] contact with I don't know if you're in
[02:41] charge of that or like someone else also
[02:43] uh but for me you were the person that
[02:45] put me on stage um before that I was
[02:47] only on like 100 people stages like
[02:50] small stages like making Bitcoin
[02:53] presentation in front of like two three
[02:55] families that were like coming together
[02:57] and like hey can you explain us Bitcoin
[02:59] something like that that was a whole
[03:00] another level I just wanted to to bring
[03:02] it in and say say thank you to you also
[03:04] on the recording yeah that's awesome
[03:06] thanks for for mentioning that and it's
[03:09] really like that's the F my favorite
[03:10] part of the job I mean we get some flak
[03:13] for having like giant celebrities or
[03:15] politicians or or people that you know
[03:17] are tangentially related to bitcoin but
[03:21] my job is finding those plebs the
[03:24] developers all these folks that uh
[03:27] either haven't necessarily spoken to a
[03:30] big audience or um are you know just
[03:34] focused on other things and then I get
[03:36] to invite them and bring them on stage
[03:38] and so I that's the thing that I love
[03:40] and I work with with one other person
[03:42] McShan and fortunately for me he's
[03:44] dealing with a lot of the the
[03:46] celebrities and the the bigger names the
[03:48] main stage is his realm and then I get
[03:50] to focus on the mining stage the open
[03:52] source stage or like genesis stage all
[03:54] these other stages that I get to focus
[03:56] on and really that's I personally love
[03:59] that so yeah I'm glad you join us yeah
[04:02] that that's really cool I love that um
[04:05] really it also resonates a lot actually
[04:07] what I try to do because I have every
[04:09] day a guest on and yes Michael saor Jeff
[04:11] poof Natalie prell all the big ones were
[04:13] on uh but the real fun conversations are
[04:16] usually the ones with complete nobodies
[04:18] and I actually have them writing me uh
[04:21] just like a short message on on Twitter
[04:24] because the word of that slowly gets
[04:25] around now they have not even a real
[04:28] Twitter account they have like 12
[04:29] followers and they're like hey I have
[04:31] that really interesting uh opinion piece
[04:33] can we can you try recording and I
[04:35] always try like if if someone writes me
[04:37] I always try I never guarantee that I
[04:38] publish also uh because if it's just not
[04:41] interesting enough or if it's not coming
[04:44] to anything that's kind of the Tage that
[04:46] I have if you put someone on stage you
[04:48] cannot delete it afterwards I can I can
[04:51] still do that uh but that's the most fun
[04:53] part just talking with someone that you
[04:55] have never talked before and just like
[04:57] try it out and see if something
[04:58] interesting comes out and
[05:00] uh there there's the uh there are some
[05:02] really interesting guests that came out
[05:04] and were extremely successful also with
[05:06] like just the numbers uh of the podcast
[05:09] so that's the most exciting part of the
[05:11] work obviously it's a huge honor and
[05:13] obviously it's a huge excitement for me
[05:15] if I can talk with Michael sa in person
[05:17] in Prague and have them on my podcast
[05:19] for like one and a half hours uh that's
[05:22] that's amazing uh but that's a different
[05:24] kind of excitement a different kind of
[05:26] uh fun uh because most of the days I
[05:29] don't have Michael S
[05:31] on uh and it's it's a lot of fun talking
[05:34] with uh people that are not as known in
[05:37] in the public scene I guess yeah it's um
[05:40] it's so interesting because the the
[05:42] content on a podcast is like you can
[05:44] really take a deep dive with one person
[05:46] and really go uh wherever the
[05:49] conversation leads but also just go deep
[05:52] into their expertise and for the
[05:55] conferences we are trying to fit a very
[05:57] interesting conversation in a short
[05:59] amount of time with as many people as uh
[06:03] as makes sense so it's typically three
[06:05] or four people on stage and getting them
[06:08] to have a conversation that's
[06:10] interesting and so it's like it's it's
[06:11] almost a puzzle of matching who's G to
[06:14] go with whom and how to uh what content
[06:17] they're going to talk about what what
[06:19] subject they're going to talk about and
[06:20] just it's figuring out how who goes
[06:23] together and then what they're going to
[06:24] talk about is is also really fun for me
[06:28] oh really cool perfect I think this is
[06:30] the perfect segue also into what you can
[06:32] talk really good about as you deal with
[06:34] so many bitcoiners is like the cultural
[06:37] uh thing in Bitcoin um what is let's
[06:42] start with that how would you uh uh
[06:46] check like how would you summarize what
[06:48] a Bitcoin is how would you um
[06:50] characterize a bitcoiner uh and then
[06:53] maybe we can later go a little bit in uh
[06:56] Bitcoin maximalism and all those things
[06:59] yeah oh man that's such a an interesting
[07:01] question because I think my answer for
[07:05] what is a bitcoiner now is very
[07:10] different than it might have been five
[07:12] years ago or six years ago um I came
[07:15] into this space in like the middle of
[07:18] euphoria in 2017 so Bitcoin was going up
[07:22] like a few hundred or $1,000 a day when
[07:26] I was getting in interested and so I
[07:28] thought I was a genius bitcoin's going
[07:30] up uh it's going to be the next money
[07:32] and then within months it crashed and
[07:36] so that's when like the maximalism
[07:40] became very uh toxic if you will that's
[07:43] when like uh everybody was calling out
[07:47] uh any other crypto for you know being a
[07:49] scam being a shitcoin it was after this
[07:52] Ico boom which took a lot of money and
[07:54] and then from people and didn't
[07:56] necessarily provide uh products that
[07:58] were being uh sold as these Investments
[08:01] U and so really the culture of what is a
[08:05] bitcoiner became like you didn't touch
[08:08] any other crypto you uh were fervently a
[08:12] Bitcoin supporter you were an
[08:15] Evangelical Bitcoin user um and to me I
[08:20] think the definition has changed a
[08:22] little bit more um and I think that
[08:24] really came about with with ordinals
[08:27] honestly I think that this new
[08:30] technology whether you uh like it or not
[08:34] value it or not think it's a scam or not
[08:37] it brought in all these other folks who
[08:40] had been dabbling with other coins and I
[08:44] think that since the creation of
[08:47] ordinals it has now kind of widened this
[08:52] uh definition of what is a bitcoiner
[08:54] because there are people that came from
[08:56] other chains and they're still using
[08:58] other chains but they are also using
[09:01] Bitcoin so I think if I had to really
[09:04] distill what is a bitcoiner I would I
[09:07] would say that there's a few maybe
[09:09] there's a few different types of
[09:10] bitcoiners maybe there are bitcoiners
[09:12] that are like the maximalists who run a
[09:15] node maybe they mine at home using a bid
[09:18] ax or or an S9 uh maybe uh they only use
[09:24] Bitcoin and everything else they they
[09:26] don't even look at um I think Pete Rizzo
[09:29] would describe these as like a monetary
[09:31] Max maximalist um and then then there's
[09:34] the people that like see these ordinals
[09:37] and and things as an interesting thing
[09:38] and are also using that but only touch
[09:40] Bitcoin maybe those are like the uh I
[09:42] think again Pete Rizzo describes that as
[09:44] like a network maximalist um and so I
[09:48] think there are kind of different camps
[09:51] of bitcoiners and I think my definition
[09:53] is a little bit more loose since that
[09:55] that time where I was fervently anti all
[09:59] cry cryto anti everything on other
[10:00] chains um and there was a good reason
[10:03] for that it was that people were losing
[10:05] a lot of money and and buying into
[10:07] things that were uh going to zero
[10:09] because people were uh rugging them or
[10:12] pulling uh the the technology was
[10:14] inferior and so I think yeah I think
[10:17] that my idea of of what is a Bitcoin or
[10:21] opened and I think that part of part of
[10:24] why that's happened is that the The
[10:28] Narrative when I first first really was
[10:30] like uh in that toxic Maxi Camp of every
[10:33] all all other crypto is is a shitcoin is
[10:36] because the The Narrative the popular
[10:39] narrative was anything
[10:41] worthwhile built on these other chains
[10:43] so whether that's like um ZK proofs or
[10:47] or rollups or things like that if it's
[10:49] worthwhile it's going to be built on
[10:51] bitcoin all these other chains are
[10:52] worthless on their own but if they have
[10:55] useful technology it's going to come to
[10:57] bitcoin and I think that
[11:00] a lot of people forgot that that was the
[11:01] narrative or their minds changed which
[11:04] happens and now that all this other
[11:06] technology is coming to bitcoin and
[11:08] developers from other chains are coming
[11:09] to bitcoin people are getting upset
[11:13] about that um and they've like forgotten
[11:15] that and they're saying well we don't
[11:16] want these devs from other chains we
[11:18] just want to build Bitcoin as a monetary
[11:20] tool
[11:22] and I am interested in that and I think
[11:27] that there are interesting Fe features
[11:29] that could be added to bitcoin um that
[11:32] might even improve Bitcoin as a monetary
[11:34] tool so that's a a long-winded way to
[11:38] answer that like I think the definition
[11:40] of a bitcoiner is is somebody who uses
[11:43] Bitcoin and I think that it's open for
[11:47] interpretation whether or not that's the
[11:49] only definition of of what a bitcoiner
[11:52] is I love that um Isa asked me actually
[11:56] at Bitcoin Amsterdam in I think Bitcoin
[11:57] backstage this the same question that's
[11:59] why I was kind of curious what you say
[12:02] and I also gave a longwinded answer in
[12:04] the end I said a Bitcoin is a human
[12:08] being like because everyone eventually
[12:11] will get to to some Bitcoin um really
[12:14] interesting I think also the
[12:16] conversation between Bitcoin Maxi and
[12:18] toxic Bitcoin Maxi uh to make the
[12:21] differentiation here is is super
[12:23] interesting uh you said it toxic Bitcoin
[12:26] if you hate on other projects that's
[12:28] 100% and what I also describe to because
[12:31] I see myself as a Bitcoin Maxi and my
[12:35] development in the last year completely
[12:37] changed on like one and a half years ago
[12:39] before I started the podcast I was
[12:42] absolutely a toxic Bitcoin Maxi I hated
[12:44] on everything that wasn't Bitcoin and I
[12:47] think that's not being a free market
[12:51] maximalist and uh true Bitcoin Maxi as I
[12:54] Define it of course other people have
[12:56] maybe other definitions uh is a free
[12:58] market Market maximalist where you see
[13:02] uh you you adopt the thing that makes
[13:04] the most sense for me is this right now
[13:06] solely Bitcoin and a focus Sol on
[13:09] bitcoin uh but I choose not to hate on
[13:12] other people and on other projects uh
[13:14] because I think that's kind of an
[13:16] arrogant stand to have if you hate on
[13:19] other projects and other stands it's
[13:21] like oh I'm the superior guy and this
[13:24] project is really dumb uh that that's
[13:27] kind of I I don't like like that with
[13:30] anything even if 97% of the world would
[13:33] agree that that 1% is wrong I I I I I
[13:37] choose not to hate on other people and
[13:41] with crypto most of the projects like I
[13:43] think all of the projects uh are run by
[13:46] people and it's not a commodity like
[13:48] Bitcoin so when you uh uh hate on that
[13:52] project you hate on the people just like
[13:54] I'm 100% in Bitcoin I don't have any
[13:56] other altcoins I probably will never
[13:58] will
[13:59] um and but still try to focus solely on
[14:03] it so I think your description is really
[14:05] good and and and I love that act lot one
[14:09] thing that is is was eye openening to me
[14:13] was you know the toxic maximalist who I
[14:16] would have I I would have identified
[14:18] myself as one a few years
[14:21] ago right now what's happening is all
[14:24] these developers these very smart people
[14:27] who have left Bitcoin or maybe never
[14:29] were focused on bitcoin because they
[14:32] felt that it was limited in its
[14:33] technological development were working
[14:36] on other chains and now we're starting
[14:39] to see a lot of these very smart
[14:41] developers come back or come to bitcoin
[14:44] for the first time so we have two
[14:46] options we could say you were focused on
[14:49] this shitcoin we don't want you here or
[14:51] we could say great more smart people to
[14:54] help improve or work on bitcoin and so I
[14:57] think that's the part that has really
[15:00] opened my eyes because I would much more
[15:03] prefer that these really smart people
[15:06] are focusing their mind share on bitcoin
[15:09] instead of what I believe is wasting
[15:10] time with other chains so to me that's
[15:14] like that's the the better way to to go
[15:16] about it is focus on uh accepting and
[15:20] seeing how we can work together and
[15:22] collaborate and get to bitcoin to the
[15:25] point where it can support8 billion
[15:27] people right now it's not able to do
[15:30] that right now Bitcoin can scale to like
[15:32] 200 million users on chain that's like
[15:36] 2% of the population and so bitcoin's in
[15:39] a really interesting place right now um
[15:42] there's talk of a Bitcoin strategic
[15:46] Reserve with the incoming US president
[15:50] who is the first Bitcoin and crypto
[15:54] president uh that maybe I well I
[15:57] wouldn't say the world but the us has
[15:59] ever seen and so I think people maybe
[16:03] underestimate his desire to um create a
[16:07] Bitcoin strategic Reserve however you
[16:09] feel about Donald Trump he likes to line
[16:11] his own Pockets he likes to make money
[16:13] and so he's going to push for a a way to
[16:18] do that off Bitcoin he's already done
[16:20] that with with crypto in his world
[16:22] Liberty five project he's going to try
[16:24] to make himself more money through
[16:26] Bitcoin and so I think that means maybe
[16:30] a strategic Bitcoin Reserve if not it's
[16:32] still going to be part of the inaugural
[16:34] uh discussion and I and he's attending
[16:37] um I just learned about it there's like
[16:39] a crypto ball that's happening with like
[16:42] David Sachs and um and David Bailey also
[16:45] and so like that that Trump is attending
[16:48] at the uh inauguration so I think that
[16:52] that's one really interesting point
[16:54] governments are paying attention to what
[16:56] Trump's doing and so I think that we are
[17:00] going to start hearing more about other
[17:03] governments um adopting Bitcoin or or
[17:06] stockpiling Bitcoin the U micro strategy
[17:11] it had incredible performance metap
[17:13] Planet a Japanese company that adopted a
[17:15] Bitcoin treasury strategy is the best
[17:17] performing stock uh on the planet this
[17:19] past year so we're at a really
[17:22] interesting point where it's like an
[17:23] inflection point governments are
[17:25] adopting it companies are paying
[17:27] attention and and also the developers
[17:30] are now coming back to bitcoin and
[17:32] thinking there's ways that we can scale
[17:34] this to Millions more people and so
[17:37] there's a big conversation that
[17:38] happening with covenants and um
[17:42] improving ways that utx ownership utxo
[17:45] ownership can scale to more people and
[17:48] so I to me I find this to be a
[17:50] fascinating year for Bitcoin 2025 is is
[17:53] a really interesting year because of all
[17:55] these things that are going on at once
[17:57] and I'm not
[17:59] uh saying that there's a certain
[18:01] Covenant proposal that should happen
[18:03] there's many that are be are proposed
[18:06] many of these opcode these sopt foric
[18:07] proposals that are proposed and some
[18:10] have uh better features than others some
[18:12] work better in tandem with one another
[18:15] uh but I think the conversation that's
[18:16] happening right now is is it's the first
[18:19] time I've seen a conversation like this
[18:21] happen
[18:22] since truthfully even I mean tap r is
[18:25] was the last time there was a major
[18:27] softwork and and it really only took a
[18:30] handful of uh reputable developers and
[18:35] reputable people in the space to say
[18:37] that they support Tapo and then
[18:38] basically everybody got on board and so
[18:42] now what's happening is there's all
[18:43] these Covenant proposals there's not a
[18:46] clear developer leader um in Bitcoin
[18:48] core like there had been around tap rpro
[18:52] and the discussion is like like the
[18:55] developers haven't fully agreed on what
[18:58] is the best path forward because it's
[19:00] difficult to make a change in Bitcoin
[19:02] and so that's happening on one side and
[19:04] then on the other side is governments
[19:05] are talking about adopting it we already
[19:07] have black rock adopting it uh and
[19:10] Fidelity and all bitwise all these major
[19:12] institutions and so once the the concern
[19:16] is that once governments start to adopt
[19:19] it they have a a monetary Financial
[19:23] vested interest in keeping Bitcoin as is
[19:26] don't change it don't mess with the
[19:28] money
[19:29] and so there's this pressure coming
[19:31] happening on both sides of like uh time
[19:34] pressure we got to do this before
[19:36] governments adopt it that's one argument
[19:40] and then the other argument is like well
[19:42] we don't even know you guys haven't even
[19:43] decided what's the best path forward and
[19:46] then the other is like well governments
[19:48] are going to adopt it and we we
[19:50] shouldn't change it at all and so this
[19:52] is to me these uh conversations are
[19:55] extremely interesting because what going
[19:58] to happen is Bitcoin going to stay as is
[20:01] and scale to institutions and not really
[20:06] scale to be P top money maybe that it
[20:09] currently seems like that's what the
[20:10] market is is pushing for or working
[20:13] towards um micro strategy owns 2% of the
[20:17] entire Bitcoin Supply um Black Rock I
[20:21] don't I don't remember the number but
[20:22] they have a significant portion after
[20:24] the ETF was launched just last April so
[20:27] the market seem seems like it's just
[20:29] going to sit on bitcoin as a store of
[20:31] value and maybe it won't necessarily be
[20:33] P2P currency um and so the other
[20:36] interesting thing about this developer
[20:38] argument for me is that the people that
[20:41] are saying we need Bitcoin to be PTP
[20:43] money because that's what Satoshi wanted
[20:46] that's very similar to the big blocker
[20:49] argument from 2017 where they said we
[20:51] need more blocks Bitcoin is not being
[20:53] used as currency it can't scale to
[20:55] billions of people so we need bigger
[20:57] blocks to fit in more transactions so
[20:59] people can use it like
[21:01] currency so those two arguments are very
[21:05] similar but the market is kind of saying
[21:08] well we just want to use it as a store
[21:10] of value and issue you know debt against
[21:13] it or take out loans uh using Bitcoin as
[21:16] currency or as the as the uh the
[21:19] collateral and so for me I'm just
[21:23] observing and I'm I just find all of
[21:26] this so fascinating because I personally
[21:28] am interested in the the technological
[21:30] discussion and using Bitcoin as
[21:32] technology uh but I'm also interested in
[21:35] like what's the market think and I am
[21:38] not sure what the the clear the clear
[21:40] answer is and what's going to happen so
[21:42] to me this is just a very interesting
[21:44] time to be in
[21:46] Bitcoin it's super how important is it
[21:49] for you that we have that a very big
[21:54] proportion of the world uh has access to
[21:57] the main layer because obviously scaling
[22:00] can be of layer two layer three layer
[22:02] four and stuff like that uh and I don't
[22:05] I I did an episode with vicet About utxo
[22:07] Management uh really in-depth one I can
[22:09] highly recommend if someone is like utxo
[22:12] management what is this because you you
[22:13] mention it uh just Google utex
[22:15] Management on my channel you should uh
[22:17] find it uh and he also talked about
[22:21] um what he thinks how many institutions
[22:24] and and how many individual people can
[22:27] uh transact daily on on the main chain
[22:30] as is uh I don't remember the exact uh
[22:33] number I don't want to uh say it wrong
[22:35] but it was a very small number compared
[22:37] to like eight billion people and then
[22:40] eight billion people plus institutions
[22:42] plus companies plus all the other things
[22:45] that also want to do that uh how
[22:47] important is base layer access uh and
[22:51] can be the same peer-to-peer
[22:54] uh electronic cash Vision be achieved
[22:57] maybe with a layer
[22:59] too that's a good question and to me I
[23:03] think that most people in the world will
[23:07] probably not interact with Bitcoin on
[23:10] the base layer I think that's a reality
[23:14] and I think if you have taken control of
[23:17] your own Keys um it's it's the Genesis b
[23:20] day which is also proof of keys day um
[23:22] and so that's you know self- custody
[23:24] Bitcoin is the most important thing if
[23:26] you have your Bitcoin in self- custody
[23:28] if you have sent a Bitcoin transaction
[23:31] that you are probably going to be in the
[23:33] minority of people 20 304 years from now
[23:38] of of who have actually used Bitcoin on
[23:40] the base layers so I actually think that
[23:43] it is extremely important and I don't
[23:45] think that we will be able to get
[23:47] Bitcoin to to scale on the base layer
[23:50] to8 billion people but that isn't to say
[23:53] that we shouldn't try to scale Bitcoin
[23:56] to the base layer for as many people
[23:58] people as possible and so that's the
[24:01] part where I think the the conversation
[24:05] um isn't there's no clear Direction yet
[24:10] the conversation from a lot of
[24:11] developers is saying like what I just
[24:13] said that we should be trying to scale
[24:16] Bitcoin to as many people as possible on
[24:18] the base layer but how do we do that is
[24:22] the main question and I think people
[24:25] don't realize or have short-term memory
[24:28] in the fact that it doesn't take much
[24:31] for fees to get crazy and to become uh
[24:36] for Bitcoin to become unusable in a
[24:39] short period of time um when
[24:42] brc2 tokens were created invented that
[24:47] standard fees were
[24:50] 500 plus Satoshi SATs per VB uh to get
[24:55] into a block if you were in a if you
[24:57] needed to tr transact quickly then it
[25:00] was extremely expensive to send any
[25:02] Bitcoin anywhere because of how high
[25:04] fees were that happened almost overnight
[25:08] and so when people look now and say oh
[25:11] well there's one sat per Vite
[25:13] transactions being confirmed that's the
[25:16] lowest possible fee that you can send
[25:18] that's happening right now uh a year and
[25:20] a half later you just had to wait some
[25:22] period of time for fees to go down
[25:24] that's true and nobody was prepared or
[25:28] expecting that fees were going to go as
[25:30] high as they did as quickly as they did
[25:33] so that's the part where if there's some
[25:36] type of covenants you can prepare you
[25:39] can plan in advance you can have
[25:41] transactions pre-signed and ready to go
[25:43] that will be confirmed in the block and
[25:46] so to me that's where there's got to I
[25:49] believe there's some middle ground
[25:50] there's some version of covenants that
[25:53] probably will help scale Bitcoin more
[25:57] and so on the basis player and I think
[25:59] that is that is what we it's up to the
[26:02] community to kind of figure out that's a
[26:04] good point yeah it will be will be an
[26:07] interesting discussion especially with B
[26:09] bit with every day that goes on uh more
[26:12] people are on the table and discussing
[26:15] with each other uh on on the potential
[26:18] future of Bitcoin uh which is also an
[26:20] interesting Dynamic where uh it gets
[26:23] more and more stable in the development
[26:25] but it also gets more difficult to move
[26:27] Bitcoin in One Direction or another um
[26:30] which is which is an interesting thing
[26:33] um for me also scaling uh is interesting
[26:36] when we look at the lightning Network
[26:37] and liquid Network there seems to be
[26:40] also like many many different solutions
[26:42] because we always talk like okay main
[26:44] layer scaling versus like Layer Two
[26:47] scaling but even on Layer Two scaling
[26:49] there are so many different Avenues you
[26:51] can go through everywhere I now paid in
[26:54] Bitcoin was always with lightning uh I
[26:57] never paid any anything on chain I never
[27:00] I got paid on chain uh multiple times
[27:03] but only from the sponsors and stuff
[27:05] like that but I never paid in in in in
[27:08] on chain only paid with with lightning
[27:11] um how do you see Layer Two Solutions
[27:14] with like lightning liquid and fedy Min
[27:16] and all the probably 500 other things
[27:19] that we could
[27:20] mention yeah I think I I've been
[27:24] interested in like the ecash and fedt
[27:27] stuff I haven't experimented too much
[27:29] with it in terms of lightning I tried to
[27:32] run a lightning node years ago and
[27:36] realized that first of all you need a
[27:38] lot of Bitcoin up front if you're
[27:40] running your own lightning node to to
[27:43] put into channels and to lock into
[27:45] channels and so there was a period of
[27:47] time where I was trying to run this
[27:48] lightning node and realized that if
[27:51] something happened to my lightning node
[27:53] and it crashed I actually did not feel
[27:55] skilled enough to recover the lightning
[27:57] node
[27:58] um and so that was me personally I think
[28:01] there's plenty of people that run their
[28:02] own nodes and I recommend people try it
[28:06] um but for me personally it was I
[28:08] realized like oh I don't feel skilled
[28:10] enough to do this and so I closed my
[28:13] channels and took my Bitcoin off and
[28:16] then chose intentionally to use um a
[28:20] service like Phoenix uh vers it which
[28:23] was it's a it's they operate all the
[28:25] channels in the background it's not
[28:27] non-custodial
[28:28] lightning but they're operating it and
[28:30] so I think that that's a positive way
[28:33] forward but also at the same time we've
[28:35] seen companies like Mutiny shut down
[28:38] because they didn't want to have the
[28:40] responsibility of dealing with all that
[28:42] Phoenix left the United States because
[28:44] of concerns around regulation and then
[28:48] then there's um wall of Satoshi for
[28:50] example which is like a fully custodial
[28:53] lightning wallet and so I think the I
[28:57] think in term terms of scaling on layer
[28:59] twos people are going to make tradeoffs
[29:03] based on their threat model based on
[29:05] their comfort level and I don't think
[29:08] there's anything wrong with those
[29:09] tradeoffs I think it's just
[29:11] understanding that you're making
[29:12] trade-offs and so I think there will be
[29:15] some people that don't trust anybody and
[29:18] want to just focus fully on running
[29:20] their own lightning node running their
[29:22] own fedt running their own uh backend
[29:25] software and then those people will
[29:29] either have like they'll run a routing
[29:32] node and have other people who have
[29:34] different trade-off and threat model
[29:36] assumptions work with them and I think
[29:38] that's one of the beautiful things about
[29:39] Bitcoin is that you can make it work for
[29:44] for you it depends on how you are
[29:46] operating and how you are wanting to use
[29:48] it but you can make it work for you on a
[29:51] technological level so if you are
[29:53] extremely technical you could do all
[29:54] those things on your own but if you're
[29:56] not you could just use a custodial uh
[29:59] lightning app for a small spending
[30:01] amount of Bitcoin and then if they you
[30:03] know rug in the future maybe you only
[30:05] lost a small amount so I think scaling
[30:08] is going to be different for every for
[30:10] different people and even different
[30:12] communities so for example I went to to
[30:15] bitcoin jungle in uvita Costa Rica I
[30:18] highly recommend everybody go and check
[30:20] it out the that Bitcoin community that
[30:23] there's a couple of developers who
[30:25] created a Bitcoin jungle app it's a
[30:27] custodial Bitcoin app but a ton of
[30:31] people in the town use it and then but
[30:33] they they encourage you to take self-
[30:35] custody you can remove your Bitcoin from
[30:37] there but in terms of just ease they
[30:40] operate the Bitcoin app as a custodial
[30:43] app and there's a ton of vendors in
[30:46] Costa Rica not just in this Bitcoin
[30:48] Jungle Town in uvita but all over the
[30:51] country where you can go and spend
[30:52] Bitcoin and remove it from there when
[30:55] you want so there's a trusted group of
[30:57] people that operate this and I think
[30:59] that's kind of what we're going to see
[31:00] moving forward is that a lot of
[31:02] bitcoiners who have been in the space
[31:04] for a while are going to be their Uncle
[31:05] Jim of for their friends and community
[31:07] and run the the apps or run the hold the
[31:10] keys and then people in the community
[31:14] who are not Technical and just want to
[31:16] you know use money without even thinking
[31:18] about it are going to interact with
[31:20] those apps in like a more custodial
[31:21] fashion so I don't know exactly how that
[31:24] looks like with fimt or lightning or
[31:26] custodial like cust sodial Solutions but
[31:28] I do think that there's going to be a a
[31:30] mixture of those things and I think
[31:32] people are already doing that to some
[31:34] extent nobody that I know has their
[31:37] entire stack on a lightning node you
[31:40] might have like most of your hopefully
[31:43] you have most of it in in cold storage
[31:46] somewhere maybe a multi- signature setup
[31:48] um and then you have a small amount
[31:50] spending that's on lightning and maybe
[31:53] that's custodial or not but but there
[31:56] even that alone is a modular setup that
[31:59] that meets different
[32:01] needs absolutely and and I for example
[32:05] only use wallet of Satoshi because I
[32:07] never have more than like $50 or $100 on
[32:10] there so if wallet of Satoshi rocks me
[32:14] I'm okay with that like the use
[32:16] experience is so easy I don't have to
[32:18] worry about anything uh and that's fine
[32:21] for me personally I don't know if that's
[32:24] good for the overall development of
[32:26] Bitcoin I try not think about that
[32:29] because I think
[32:30] Bitcoin works when the best incentives
[32:34] come together like when everyone with
[32:36] their own incentives come together uh it
[32:38] still should work otherwise it will
[32:40] never be successful um and then other
[32:42] point is really interesting when we all
[32:44] have the same protocol with Bitcoin um
[32:47] we all can uh use different clients and
[32:50] different apps and it doesn't matter if
[32:52] I use wallet of satosi and New Phoenix
[32:55] we still can exchange money like it
[32:57] doesn't matter which which app we're
[32:59] using as long it's the same protocol uh
[33:02] and that's an exciting future because
[33:04] there's an story about that actually so
[33:07] I I went to Portugal with my family um
[33:10] to do this this program and with other
[33:14] families and there was this we needed a
[33:17] car seat and so somebody went to the
[33:19] store they were already going to the
[33:20] store they bought us a car seat and they
[33:22] came back and they were from Canada and
[33:25] so we had this whole back and forth of
[33:27] like oh do you have venmo no we don't
[33:29] have venmo oh do you have cash app no we
[33:31] don't have cash app oh do you use zel no
[33:33] I don't use zel and it was like I just
[33:35] wanted to give them 20 bucks and I
[33:38] fortunately had 20 EUR in my in my
[33:40] wallet but there was this huge back and
[33:42] forth and I was just like oh my gosh
[33:43] Bitcoin fixes this because it's like it
[33:45] didn't wouldn't have mattered we could
[33:47] have just used Bitcoin and they could
[33:48] that would have been it and if you know
[33:50] most people don't even use cash anymore
[33:52] so it was just fortunate that I had that
[33:53] money but it was a funny experience of
[33:56] like oh there's a reason that there's
[33:57] like open monetary Network that is just
[33:59] so much better than than all these other
[34:02] close sourced apps I partnered up with
[34:06] coin vigilante this is the most
[34:08] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[34:11] saw created by anyone look at that
[34:14] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[34:17] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[34:20] the perfect subtle eligent way to go out
[34:23] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[34:25] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[34:29] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[34:32] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:35] watch collections you have the date of
[34:38] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[34:41] there and of course also the block
[34:43] height and which Epoch we are currently
[34:46] in I love the level of detail they put
[34:49] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[34:52] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[34:55] time pieces down in the description I
[34:58] love those watches so so much if you
[35:01] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[35:03] regular basis I'll guess you already
[35:05] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[35:08] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[35:11] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[35:13] personal recommendation for hard wallet
[35:15] is the bitbox it's super secure it's
[35:18] simple to set up it's also perfect gift
[35:20] for a friend who has still the Bitcoin
[35:23] on an exchange and you can get a 5%
[35:26] discount with the code Robin at the
[35:29] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[35:33] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[35:35] to really level up your sovereignty as
[35:38] an individual you have to have the most
[35:40] secure self- custody setup you have to
[35:43] secure your own devices you have to
[35:46] protect your privacy you have to set up
[35:49] an inheritance plan and depending on
[35:51] where you live you even want to have a
[35:54] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[35:57] in case something goes really really
[35:58] wrong and through all those steps the
[36:00] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[36:03] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[36:06] way.com
[36:08] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[36:10] minute free call to find out how you can
[36:13] level up your sovereignty it's the same
[36:17] thing uh coin vigilante American company
[36:19] is one of my sponsors they are from
[36:20] America and they operate in US dollar
[36:23] I'm in Europe uh it's it's euros and
[36:27] even there where two Western banking
[36:30] systems come to each other both work
[36:32] very well within them but if you want to
[36:35] exchange from there to then you have to
[36:36] give a lot of like routing numbers and
[36:38] numbers that I never heard
[36:40] about um
[36:42] and yeah and there are a lot of uh all
[36:45] of a sudden uh fees involved in that
[36:48] also uh way higher fees than on on the
[36:51] Bitcoin main by the way and then we just
[36:54] said like like why should we try with
[36:56] fear just like let's just do it with
[36:58] Bitcoin uh and it was super it was on a
[37:00] Sunday evening uh and we just did it and
[37:03] I was like that's perfect like that's
[37:04] how should be uh and this was one of my
[37:08] first like really uh uh real use case
[37:12] moments where I saw the power of of of
[37:15] one protocol yeah that's that's a great
[37:17] Point um you also talked uh uh speaking
[37:20] about that about the Genesis blog how
[37:22] today is the birthday for people that
[37:24] might be confused like today is the
[37:26] third of of January uh and I will post
[37:29] that a few days later uh so if that's
[37:32] published and you listening today is not
[37:34] the Genesis blog day just to not confuse
[37:37] people uh but is that the is are you
[37:41] considering like first of all for people
[37:42] that don't know about that um what is
[37:44] that and then do you consider that as
[37:47] the real birthday of Bitcoin or is maybe
[37:50] the white paper day also the real
[37:51] birthday what what do you consider as
[37:53] the the real starting day of of Bitcoin
[37:57] uh well so this is interesting because
[37:59] partially in preparation for recording
[38:01] this podcast I reached out to a couple
[38:04] people to because I had been familiar
[38:07] with the fact that Satoshi had created
[38:09] this block on on January 3D um I I would
[38:14] consider January 3rd to be the birthday
[38:16] of Bitcoin compared to the white paper
[38:17] day um because it's actually the time
[38:20] where where the the anchor to the
[38:22] Bitcoin blockchain was created um but I
[38:25] was also familiar with the fact that
[38:28] the the next block wasn't mined until
[38:31] like late on the eth if you look at
[38:33] mempool dospace but really I think it
[38:35] was like the ninth and most people talk
[38:37] about it as the ninth because he created
[38:41] the Genesis block but then didn't
[38:43] release the code until the 9th until a
[38:46] few days later and so to me I what I
[38:50] found to be really just like a neat fact
[38:52] is that like Bitcoin just like existed
[38:55] in like uh isolation like on its own in
[38:58] the in the darkness for like for 6 days
[39:01] until the next block was mine so uh if
[39:05] you know if Bitcoin was a religion it's
[39:07] almost like Satoshi created the the
[39:10] Bitcoin and then waited and then on the
[39:13] sixth day said like Let There Be blocks
[39:15] and so like for me it's just neat that
[39:17] there's like this like period of time
[39:19] where it was like Bitcoin just existed
[39:21] and like people didn't know that it
[39:24] existed it just was like in the darkness
[39:26] and so I for I just find that to be like
[39:28] a neat thing um but that is kind of that
[39:32] is why it's like it existed and then he
[39:34] didn't release the code until six days
[39:37] later and that is that's because if he
[39:39] released the code then anybody could
[39:41] have created the Genesis block and there
[39:43] could have been a bunch of different
[39:45] competing Bitcoins from the beginning um
[39:47] and so it's also the how he didn't
[39:50] pre-mine because he didn't create the
[39:52] Genesis block on the thir mine until the
[39:55] 9th and then release the code he waited
[39:57] and then once it was on the 9th that's
[39:59] when he uh released the code to
[40:02] everybody and then also started mining I
[40:05] also think that the he his Bitcoin that
[40:07] are publicly known that are most likely
[40:10] this like 1 million amount of Bitcoin or
[40:12] whatever it is uh I think he just threw
[40:15] away the key to that I think he
[40:17] intentionally uh wanted to have like
[40:20] that first 1 million Bitcoin to be
[40:23] completely unmovable and this is like
[40:26] kind of the his contribution to the
[40:28] Bitcoin network uh of like those Bitcoin
[40:31] will never move and he probably mind
[40:34] some on the on the side my just a pure
[40:37] speculation of mine yeah I know so there
[40:41] are people that have been have tried to
[40:44] analyze the mining and the hashes of
[40:47] those early blocks to see and and so
[40:50] it's like an estimated 1 million that
[40:52] he's mined over the course of uh before
[40:54] he disappeared um so yeah I mean it
[40:58] would be interesting to know if he had
[41:00] other machines that were mining also and
[41:03] um if he mined other but I agree I that
[41:05] I think that that key is burnt and that
[41:08] that money won't move absolutely really
[41:10] cool yeah then uh in honor of the
[41:13] Genesis day it's really interesting
[41:14] what's all going on I saw I think
[41:16] yesterday or today a picture of Sailor
[41:19] and Eric Trump at M Lago what the the
[41:22] one topic that I wanted to to get back
[41:24] to uh a little bit more strategic
[41:26] Reserve you talked a little bit before
[41:29] um but you talked also about what this
[41:32] this year could do for for Bitcoin but
[41:36] strategic Reserve uh Michel making
[41:39] picture with Eric Trump at maral Lago
[41:41] Donald Trump being at the Bitcoin
[41:43] conference and all the things that that
[41:45] that are going on um what will that do
[41:49] for for Bitcoin and maybe also a second
[41:51] one what will that do for the US dollar
[41:54] if uh America actually serious LLY uh
[41:58] starts buying Bitcoin and maybe
[42:00] strengthening the US dollar with that I
[42:02] think saor also talked about that on one
[42:04] podcast publicly that he uh wants to
[42:07] advocate for uh the reserve of buying
[42:11] Bitcoin but I could be wrong about
[42:13] that yeah wow this is a rabbit hole on
[42:17] its own for sure so I
[42:21] I think well like many people probably
[42:24] have a nuanced opinion about the
[42:26] Strategic Bitcoin Reserve I think that
[42:29] it's probably good for the dollar I
[42:32] think it's probably good for the country
[42:35] and potentially for the debt that the US
[42:39] has but I also don't think it's
[42:42] necessarily the best thing for Bitcoin
[42:46] and I think that from my own selfish
[42:50] reasons of wanting to continue to see
[42:53] Bitcoin used as a peer-to-peer currency
[42:56] as opposed to
[42:57] just something that is potentially
[42:59] backing the dollar or something that is
[43:02] um an asset that is just held uh without
[43:06] being used besides uh as like um Bes how
[43:11] we potentially how we use gold currently
[43:13] we just have a bunch of gold sitting in
[43:15] vaults that are just collecting dust um
[43:18] so I think that it could be used to pay
[43:22] off the debt potentially if they if the
[43:24] government uses it like sells it to to
[43:27] pay off the debt but I don't actually
[43:29] think that's how they would use it uh
[43:32] I'm not somebody who's as it tuned into
[43:36] like how treasury markets worked and
[43:37] things like that as much as I've tried
[43:39] to be a macro guy so I don't even know
[43:42] how if that's how they would actually
[43:44] use it to pay off the debt my main
[43:46] concern is is stable coins being used to
[43:50] strengthen the dollar in a way that uh
[43:55] furthers dollar hemony because because
[43:57] currently the dollar is used to fund
[44:00] Wars it's uh being people have pay taxes
[44:04] in the dollar and it's in in my opinion
[44:08] as a taxpaying citizen of the United
[44:10] States I don't think my tax dollars are
[44:13] going to where I would prefer like them
[44:15] to go considering I have to pay taxes so
[44:19] I don't necessarily think the Strategic
[44:21] Bitcoin Reserve is like a positive thing
[44:24] I think it is a very interesting thing
[44:27] because now other governments are paying
[44:29] attention and might also start to
[44:31] collect bit uh Bitcoin and stack Bitcoin
[44:34] but to me if they're not actually using
[44:37] it to settle trade directly or with um
[44:42] within their the own their own countries
[44:44] then to me that's not as interesting
[44:47] what's most what's interesting to me and
[44:50] why I became a fervent Bitcoin
[44:53] maximalist is because I saw the power of
[44:56] Bitcoin as a uncensorable money as
[44:59] something that can't be stopped a
[45:01] borderless money that is internet native
[45:04] and could be sent anywhere in the world
[45:06] and received and have final settlement
[45:08] within 10 minutes to me that is the
[45:11] value proposition of Bitcoin this
[45:14] digital scarcity thing is just means it
[45:16] can't be debased in my opinion and so
[45:20] that right now the digital scarcity
[45:21] thing is how I believe most of these
[45:24] governments are are thinking about it
[45:27] and it is an interesting thing but if
[45:30] Bitcoin doesn't retain its censorship
[45:32] resistance and its digital peer-to-peer
[45:35] nature then that to me is less
[45:39] interesting and so I I feel a little bit
[45:43] concerned about this current push for
[45:46] dollar stable coins as a way to
[45:48] strengthen the dollar while the Bitcoin
[45:50] just sits in a vault that to me is is I
[45:55] don't want to say it's not the purpose
[45:56] of Bitcoin because it isn't the purpose
[45:58] of Bitcoin but Bitcoin the purpose of a
[46:00] system is what it does so if if Bitcoin
[46:03] becomes a a system where people are just
[46:07] uh using stable coins and the Bitcoin
[46:10] doesn't move and just sits in Black
[46:12] Rock's Vault or or with coinbase prime
[46:14] because that's or coinbase vaults or
[46:16] whatever to me that's just not
[46:19] interesting um so it currently seems
[46:22] like that might be the direction
[46:23] bitcoin's going and if if that happens
[46:26] then that's what the market dictates and
[46:28] I like you said earlier uh being a free
[46:30] market maximalist is what makes you a
[46:32] bitcoiner
[46:34] I I understand that that might be what
[46:37] happens but to me it's just not what I
[46:39] would like to see happen with Bitcoin
[46:41] because I want to see Bitcoin be a
[46:43] peer-to-peer
[46:44] currency that is borderless and
[46:46] censorship resistant that's what I would
[46:48] like to see there's even uh an
[46:51] additional argument towards that and I
[46:52] actually made that today on a guest
[46:54] appearance on another podcast uh the
[46:56] Bitcoin Journeys um where I
[47:00] said if if we actually have this crazy
[47:04] 2025 uh and and we have USA making
[47:08] stretegic Bitcoin Reserve if America
[47:10] does it this year it's almost impossible
[47:14] uh uh or let's say that it is very
[47:17] likely that a lot of other countries are
[47:19] also doing that I like five six seven
[47:23] maybe 10 other countries are doing that
[47:25] and it could snowball in a like a domino
[47:27] effect where bit uh Nations all of the
[47:29] sudden buying Bitcoin uh we sawed with
[47:32] micro strategy like micro strategy in
[47:34] 2020 was the first company there are
[47:37] many companies now that publicly traded
[47:39] companies that have Bitcoin that
[47:41] snowball in four years really really
[47:43] fast uh if the same thing happens in the
[47:45] next four years with Nations um the
[47:48] price will run away like really fast
[47:51] like the the 100,000 will really fast
[47:53] look very very cheap to everyone um and
[47:56] that's maybe good for people that have
[47:58] now a lot of Bitcoin or are already kind
[48:01] of satisfied with their stack uh but as
[48:05] and that's very self selfish of me but
[48:08] I'm a 26 year old guy I want to have as
[48:11] many Bitcoin as I can from my
[48:14] perspective I don't want the USA to buy
[48:17] Bitcoin I want them to not buy it so I
[48:21] and many other blabs have the chance to
[48:23] buy as many Bitcoin as possible in the
[48:25] next uh years to come
[48:27] and then uh slowly slowly like Bitcoin
[48:30] will anyways uh I think we at a point
[48:32] where Bitcoin is kind of inevitable I
[48:34] like there's like there has to be like a
[48:36] Black Swan event that is not innovat um
[48:40] so in that event it should be that we
[48:45] have a longer chance to accumulate from
[48:47] that perspective and then also as you
[48:49] said and I'm I'm really cous what you
[48:51] say about because you said you you don't
[48:54] like that direction but do you see it
[48:56] maybe even as a threat to bitcoin when
[48:59] we have a lot of big corporations buying
[49:01] all the block space uh on on the main
[49:04] layer and they kind of the future new
[49:07] Banks like then we have maybe less
[49:09] central banks but we still have those
[49:11] big huge Banks sitting on the main chain
[49:14] and then uh just a few uh and then like
[49:17] the the layer twos and layer threes and
[49:20] you kind of have to oppose to those big
[49:22] p big Banks is that maybe a threat to do
[49:26] the actual
[49:27] decentralization of uh of of Bitcoin
[49:30] where not the base layer itself is a a
[49:33] threat but the people that holding uh
[49:36] Bitcoin because they cannot hold it on
[49:38] the main chain I I don't know if my
[49:40] explanation now made made sense yeah no
[49:43] I understand where your question is
[49:44] coming from so I think that it's not a
[49:47] threat to bitcoin because Bitcoin is
[49:49] antifragile I think is it a threat to
[49:52] the Bitcoin I would like to see maybe
[49:56] but I think Bitcoin is going to continue
[49:58] operating the blocks are going to
[50:00] continue being found in mind I I think
[50:04] the the base layer will still be able to
[50:06] be transacted upon but it's um but maybe
[50:10] that means it's like you said like there
[50:12] are these Banks where they are the ones
[50:14] issuing either dollar based stable coins
[50:17] with Bitcoin being backed by them or
[50:20] they're or maybe even not back they're
[50:21] just issuing dollar back dollar based
[50:24] stable coins and people are using the
[50:25] stable coins instead of using the
[50:27] Bitcoin itself so is it a but then you
[50:32] know if you have Bitcoin that you have
[50:34] self- custody maybe you can still be uh
[50:37] using it on the Chain paying the the
[50:39] probably expensive fees to do so but the
[50:42] number of people that are going to be
[50:44] doing that will probably be a lot
[50:46] smaller so in my opinion I think that's
[50:48] why we want to try to figure out some
[50:50] sort of Covenant some sort of base layer
[50:53] scaling solution to improve the custody
[50:56] of availability for as many people as
[50:58] possible so I don't think it's a threat
[51:01] to decentralization I think it is maybe
[51:04] a threat to uh upgrade ability uh so if
[51:12] like you said if all these governments
[51:14] are using it if all these corporations
[51:16] are the ones holding it they will have a
[51:21] a
[51:22] outsized ability to help dictate the
[51:26] econ omic chain so if people want to
[51:29] make a change to the Bitcoin protocol
[51:31] and these entities don't want to this
[51:34] isn't 2017 where we're talking minors
[51:37] and you know a a powerful group of
[51:40] people but not government level this is
[51:44] like we're talking governments the
[51:46] largest corporations in the world having
[51:48] an economic stake in what is bitcoin and
[51:53] so this was in the filings when bit when
[51:56] Black Rock had their ETF filings they
[51:58] said in the fine print which is you know
[52:01] potentially just due diligence and not
[52:03] like a nefarious plan that in the event
[52:06] of a fork Black Rock would be the ones
[52:09] to choose which one is the Bitcoin so
[52:13] this was something we saw in
[52:15] 2017 um with with uh a few different
[52:19] Services where they said to their users
[52:22] oh this is what we we want the the
[52:25] segwit 2x upgrade so that's going to be
[52:27] the Bitcoin that you get and a lot of
[52:29] people got upset about that and removed
[52:31] their funds or create a new Services
[52:34] instead BTC pay server is a prime
[52:36] example of that they were upset because
[52:38] they said we don't want this to be that
[52:40] Bitcoin real Bitcoin is the one that is
[52:43] not adopting the segwit 2x upgrade and
[52:46] so they created a whole new software
[52:47] based on that but I think that if that
[52:50] were to happen with black rock and
[52:51] governments we're talking like a tiny
[52:53] group of cyppher punks creating a
[52:57] a chain that is maybe more true to
[52:58] bitcoin but has a lot less economic
[53:02] weight than like Black Rock chain which
[53:05] is or the US government chain which is
[53:08] like the aifi version of Bitcoin so I
[53:11] think that these governments adopting it
[53:14] the threat is not to decentralization
[53:16] it's not to bitcoin it's to uh the
[53:19] threat is OIC and Bitcoin just remaining
[53:22] as is that doesn't scale to the whole
[53:25] world
[53:26] that's super interesting um do you see
[53:30] Bitcoin mining I know we touched on
[53:33] Bitcoin mining a lot in the like last
[53:35] like 15 to 20 episodes uh almost like
[53:39] Bitcoin mining uh month uh kind of I
[53:43] don't know why why but all the mining
[53:45] people came in December on um but we
[53:48] talked with pop berett for example about
[53:50] the problem of of block space and and
[53:53] how crucial that will be uh we talked
[53:55] about uh with other people why Bitcoin
[53:59] mining might be too centralized how the
[54:02] pool centralization is a problem how uh
[54:05] it's a problem that mining Hardware only
[54:07] comes from a few companies um and all
[54:10] the those things do you see also there
[54:13] problems of of future centralization too
[54:16] many big Corporation in Bitcoin mining
[54:19] and not enough like solo miners or um
[54:21] how does it Bob call rabbits in in in
[54:25] Bitcoin versus his horses uh I don't
[54:28] know what was the big one horses and
[54:30] rabbits and and some other elephants I
[54:32] think he calls them the big ones uh big
[54:35] uh Bitcoin miners um do do you see that
[54:37] also as a problem you know it's funny
[54:39] because when I think about the like
[54:41] concerns and things about Bitcoin that
[54:44] I'm worried about I I less often think
[54:47] about mining but all of those points
[54:50] that you brought up are are great and
[54:53] they
[54:54] are issues that should be addressed and
[54:57] I think this mining is also a really
[54:59] interesting thing that is happening this
[55:01] year um I've seen this incredible uh
[55:05] interest in mining at home but something
[55:08] that is Affordable and uh easy
[55:12] relatively easy to do um I was part of
[55:16] the home mining uh there's like a home
[55:18] mining Wizards group that happened in
[55:21] the wake of the China mining ban in 2019
[55:24] I believe it was where the rate dropped
[55:27] off by half almost overnight and a lot
[55:30] of those machines made their way to the
[55:32] US and then it became this really rabid
[55:36] uh home mining interest to to mine at
[55:40] home using a fully industrial machine in
[55:44] your house which requires uh sound
[55:47] proofing it requires special
[55:50] electrical wiring and it's really loud
[55:54] and it puts off a ton of heat and it was
[55:57] ex very expensive it was a terrible
[55:59] investment that I made I should I have
[56:01] these miners that don't mine very much
[56:03] Bitcoin because of the having and
[56:05] because of the the network difficulty
[56:07] and they're loud and they're hot and
[56:10] they basically are paper weights at my
[56:12] house right now so what I think has been
[56:15] really interesting is to see these bit a
[56:17] devices come online and be an option for
[56:20] people to at least experiment with
[56:22] mining are they like truly
[56:24] decentralizing the network Maybe that's
[56:26] debatable because it's just mining with
[56:28] like one or two her Terah hases but it's
[56:31] something that I think is really
[56:32] important for people to experiment and I
[56:35] love to see the direction of it's not
[56:37] just you buy a minor from one of the two
[56:41] major Chinese mining Hardware companies
[56:45] it's like people are tinkering and doing
[56:47] it on their own we've now seen block
[56:50] block is just now starting to uh release
[56:52] their their Miner and uh I I'm curious
[56:55] to see how that develops so I I'm really
[56:58] excited about the mining uh developments
[57:01] that are happening I agree that you know
[57:04] there's a couple pools that have a ton
[57:06] of hash rate there's also even amongst
[57:09] those pools and the smaller ones some
[57:11] people did some research that shows that
[57:14] they're even they're all using the same
[57:16] block template construction um coming
[57:18] out of I believe amp pool so it's like
[57:20] even though there's different pools
[57:22] they're still using the same exact uh
[57:24] block template construction so ocean is
[57:26] doing some really interesting stuff with
[57:28] with the miners themselves can choose
[57:30] the block templates um I think that
[57:32] there's a lot of really cool things
[57:34] happening for Mining and my dream for
[57:38] mining is that it becomes integrated
[57:40] into the household in like a very
[57:42] natural way like we're already seeing
[57:44] some companies that are building miners
[57:48] like the ones I have that are like more
[57:50] industrial size that offut a lot of heat
[57:53] they're incorporating them into people's
[57:55] like heat in air duct systems and so a
[57:58] lot of miners when I was interested in
[57:59] mining were doing this on their own um
[58:02] just putting a fan and having it go
[58:04] through their air ducts but now we're
[58:06] starting to see people that are creating
[58:07] like controllers where you you know your
[58:11] Miner turns on if your house gets below
[58:13] a certain temperature and then when it
[58:14] gets up to temperature it turns off and
[58:17] so basically instead of having a furnace
[58:19] and an air handler they are using miners
[58:22] to just do the a heat pump instead of
[58:25] having like a heat pump they're using
[58:26] miners to create the heat so it's like
[58:28] you would still be using that
[58:29] electricity to heat your house but now
[58:32] you're using that electricity to heat
[58:34] your house and you earn some Bitcoin
[58:36] back and so that's where I am most
[58:38] interested to see mining develop because
[58:41] I think it will be combin ified in a way
[58:43] that it's like incorporated into your
[58:44] house it puts off so much heat that you
[58:47] could dry your clothes with it in fact I
[58:49] used to just put a a clothes dryer next
[58:51] to my Miner and have all the heat dry my
[58:54] clothes and so
[58:56] what your dryer does is that exact same
[58:58] thing but it uses like a coil to heat up
[59:01] and then dry blow hot air over so it
[59:04] would be way more efficient if you were
[59:06] doing that with a Bitcoin miner and then
[59:08] earning money back by also drying your
[59:11] clothes so I think that's the direction
[59:13] of Mining and if we see that happen more
[59:16] more along with the block template
[59:19] construction being put in the hands of
[59:22] the miners themselves versus like a pool
[59:24] then I I think we will start to see
[59:27] better
[59:28] decentralization better practices that
[59:31] uh censorship resistant practices as
[59:33] well and I think that is to me the the
[59:36] interesting developments that will are
[59:39] that are already starting to happen with
[59:40] Bitcoin but I I would love to see that
[59:43] further oh one other really cool mining
[59:46] development that I saw and I've thought
[59:48] about a lot but I don't have solar power
[59:50] is that some people that I've seen with
[59:52] solar power when you create excess solar
[59:57] power and you have to sell it back to
[59:58] the grid otherwise or put it in a
[60:00] battery which is difficult to store
[60:02] energy and when you sell it back to the
[60:04] grid they charge you or they they pay
[60:07] you but they pay you like a fifth or
[60:10] less of what the energy is worth what
[60:12] they would sell it to you for and so
[60:16] something I've seen is people that
[60:17] generate extra excess solar use that to
[60:21] mine Bitcoin they earn some money
[60:24] instead of being uh you know rugged by
[60:26] the electricity company the Energy
[60:28] company they're actually earning some
[60:30] Bitcoin with that excess energy and then
[60:32] as soon as they net out at zero it shuts
[60:34] the miners off so that's another
[60:37] interesting development that I've seen
[60:38] and I think we're just going to see more
[60:40] and more of those when when with regards
[60:42] to
[60:43] mining that's super interesting and and
[60:46] uh we we already had a guy from bid xon
[60:49] and we also talked about ocean and is
[60:51] really interesting uh conversations
[60:53] there because you you you we kind of
[60:56] have to bring the decentralization more
[60:59] and more into in Bitcoin mining and
[61:01] really um make sure that we are the most
[61:05] decentralized I think decentralization
[61:07] is a little bit like security where uh
[61:10] you can never have 100% uh but you can
[61:13] be as close as possible to
[61:16] perfect uh but there will never be 100%
[61:20] thing they really really good points uh
[61:22] so for me the summarization is like BU
[61:24] as many people uh buy as many Bitcoin as
[61:27] as you can so you have access to the to
[61:31] the main layer in the future also even
[61:33] if if other people get priced out and
[61:36] educate as as many people as you can I
[61:39] think the education part is really
[61:40] crucial to educate people and to get the
[61:43] the the point across and I think uh
[61:45] you're doing a fantastic job with with
[61:47] put putting the programs together um
[61:50] maybe one more question what is for you
[61:53] the most crucial point in in Bitcoin
[61:56] education or differently asked if you
[61:58] had one wish to all Bitcoin Educators
[62:01] like what what would you what would you
[62:03] wish for H what would I wish for I think
[62:08] like well just in in terms of
[62:11] like Bitcoin in general and like
[62:14] bitcoiners in general I would wish for
[62:16] everybody to self custody in some way so
[62:21] that's been a big conversation recently
[62:23] of like is self- custody appropriate for
[62:25] every everybody and I think that that
[62:28] has different meanings for different
[62:30] people so maybe that means you have your
[62:34] Bitcoin stored in a single signature
[62:37] Hardware wallet or maybe that means
[62:39] you're using a service that allows you
[62:44] they a collaborative custody service
[62:45] where they hold a key and you hold a key
[62:48] um or you hold two keys and so they're
[62:50] kind of there as like a backup for you
[62:52] but I think self- custody is is the the
[62:56] most important thing for for bitcoiners
[62:58] so I would wish all bitcoiners to self-
[63:01] custody I think the the next thing I
[63:03] would wish for is for all bitcoiners to
[63:05] run a Bitcoin node it's never been more
[63:07] easy to do that there's a ton of
[63:09] products that you can just plug and play
[63:12] um and you know you just put them
[63:14] connect it to your your ethernet and
[63:16] then you can run a Bitcoin node and
[63:18] connect your your wallet to that to
[63:21] verify your own transactions to me those
[63:24] are the most important things as of
[63:27] being a bitcoiner so kind of going back
[63:29] to like what is a bitcoiner if you self
[63:32] custody and run your own node to me
[63:34] you're a bitcoiner um I think that
[63:36] there's a a followup which would be you
[63:38] know if you can experiment with mining I
[63:40] think that's a cool a way to kind of see
[63:43] how the network works on a different
[63:45] level so now it's easier than ever also
[63:48] to do that with like a bid a or
[63:49] something so I think those are the three
[63:51] things in fact I actually wrote an
[63:53] article for Bitcoin magazine I think it
[63:55] was in
[63:56] 2021 about all of these different things
[64:00] and I'm that article is clearly outdated
[64:02] uh but but it was talks about uh self-
[64:05] custody running a node and uh mining
[64:08] Bitcoin at home those are my I think the
[64:11] my biggest wishes but also my wishes for
[64:15] all bitcoiners is to to use Bitcoin more
[64:18] than just hodling hodling is using your
[64:20] Bitcoin I'm not going to say it's not a
[64:22] use but interact with the network spend
[64:25] Bitcoin when you can find businesses in
[64:28] your area that accept Bitcoin and make a
[64:31] point to support them using Bitcoin some
[64:33] of them even give you discounts if you
[64:35] pay in Bitcoin I live in a mountain town
[64:38] it's not a huge Tech area but even here
[64:42] I was able to find a a doctor uh an
[64:45] osteopath so it's a kind of alternative
[64:47] doctor and I he I chose to go to him
[64:51] because he accepted Bitcoin as payment
[64:53] and so just showing him that there are
[64:57] people that will use this as currency I
[64:59] think is a very valuable thing and so I
[65:02] think that would be my wish for for
[65:04] every bitcoiner use it spend it a little
[65:06] bit you know you can spend in replace if
[65:08] you feel like you don't want to spend it
[65:10] but we're here to improve our lives
[65:14] using Bitcoin as savings technology but
[65:17] sometimes you need to use your savings
[65:19] and so I think that is just a really
[65:21] important aspect because there are
[65:23] people that say never sell your Bitcoin
[65:25] never sell your Bitcoin and to me that
[65:28] takes away from why we're here which is
[65:31] like we're here for monetary Revolution
[65:34] and I think that is like you don't have
[65:37] a monetary Revolution without using
[65:40] money and so if you're using Bitcoin
[65:42] then that's like you're you're reaching
[65:45] the goal absolutely NE never sell but
[65:49] spend them that's kind of yeah the end
[65:53] result isn't necessarily getting more
[65:56] Fiat the end result is like you have
[65:59] this savings that you've worked for and
[66:02] stored your time and energy into a
[66:04] better money but if you have that better
[66:07] money at some point you need to use that
[66:09] yeah it's it's a powerful message and uh
[66:12] I sometimes have the retirement uh topic
[66:14] actually a pretty pretty popular topic
[66:17] also on my channel uh in in Bitcoin and
[66:20] the main message that I think we discuss
[66:22] on all of those episodes is uh you want
[66:26] to avoid dying with the biggest Bitcoin
[66:30] stack you have ever seen like you should
[66:32] you should also have some fun you should
[66:34] also use it you should also create
[66:36] something uh put it in the community uh
[66:39] like whatever like if it's building a
[66:41] business or just like spending on your
[66:44] family helping other people in need like
[66:46] all those things are amazing things to
[66:48] do don't just die with a huge stack yeah
[66:52] I mean like it's what's nice about big
[66:55] coin is it lowers your time preference
[66:57] but it shouldn't lower your time
[66:58] preference forever like to to the end of
[67:02] your life it should lower your time
[67:03] preference so you can actually improve
[67:06] the quality of your life go on a trip
[67:08] with your family like like sell the
[67:10] Bitcoin and go on a trip with your
[67:12] family sell the Bitcoin and buy a car if
[67:14] you need to like you shouldn't just
[67:16] drive around there was somebody who
[67:17] posted a picture of like they're
[67:19] completely bald tire saying like oh show
[67:22] me you're a bitcoiner without telling me
[67:24] you're a bitcoiner and it's like well
[67:26] it's not going to having a big Bitcoin
[67:27] stack if you die because your car tires
[67:30] bald is not going to like help you out
[67:33] so like buy some new tires sell some
[67:35] Bitcoin buy some new
[67:37] tires yeah it's also like the the
[67:39] completely uh destroyed underwear I'm
[67:42] like hey like buy some under buy some
[67:44] quality underwear you you're you're not
[67:47] doing yourself any good yeah you're not
[67:49] going to get a girlfriend with a big
[67:51] Bitcoin stack and holes in your
[67:52] underwear get some new underwear then
[67:55] you'll get
[67:57] absolutely yeah yeah really cool um uh
[68:00] at this point I also want to to note uh
[68:03] note one thing I know it's it's still
[68:05] quite a while but may is coming sooner
[68:07] than than some might expect and you're
[68:10] doing the programming uh there at
[68:12] Bitcoin magazine also for Bitcoin 2025 I
[68:15] will be 100% there I'm already uh
[68:18] booking my my flight there I'm really
[68:20] looking forward to to bitcoin 25 is also
[68:23] will be the my first time in in the
[68:25] Vegas will enjoy that also maybe a few
[68:27] days before that uh will be fun uh to
[68:30] see uh and for everyone that hasn't
[68:32] ticket so far now I think they way lower
[68:36] prices than in when you buy them right
[68:38] before the the PRI right before the
[68:40] event and as with uh most events you can
[68:43] use code Robin for I think a 10%
[68:46] discount if if I'm not mistaken uh so
[68:49] definitely do that and meet Craig and me
[68:51] in person at Bitcoin 205 will be really
[68:55] uh cool to do um one thing uh one
[68:59] question that I asked each and every one
[69:00] of my guests is what can we learn from
[69:03] you besides Bitcoin that's a question
[69:05] most guests actually take like a minute
[69:08] to to think
[69:10] about what could I talk about or teach
[69:13] people about yes something that uh like
[69:17] you can do go to different routes uh
[69:20] that I see people go and and and I don't
[69:22] want to put limitations on you I the one
[69:24] thing that you teach people about that
[69:26] has nothing to do with Bitcoin or one
[69:28] thing that we actually can learn from
[69:30] you as a person uh that has nothing to
[69:31] do with Bitcoin so people choose either
[69:34] from that either that or the other one
[69:37] uh on that question is really fun to see
[69:39] yeah well I don't want to be um arrogant
[69:42] and say that like
[69:44] people should learn or I could teach
[69:46] people um like something from the way
[69:50] that I live but I um I was a former
[69:55] educator I used to teach Elementary
[69:58] School in second grade and
[70:01] um in terms of like my lifestyle I've
[70:06] really focused a lot on family and so I
[70:10] have two kids and another one on the way
[70:13] and uh I don't want to say that like I'm
[70:16] the best parent by any means but like to
[70:19] me that's been a big focus of my life
[70:22] more recently and I think that um a lot
[70:26] of people are very focused on bitcoin
[70:28] and looking at the chart looking at the
[70:30] price thinking about the technology
[70:32] thinking about nation state adoption but
[70:36] um for me the the Bitcoin is is a means
[70:41] to an end and that end is like uh being
[70:44] financially secure so I can be spending
[70:46] time with my family and focusing on my
[70:48] family and so um I I think that keeping
[70:54] aware of like the bigger picture is
[70:56] something that is just really important
[70:58] uh in terms of of Bitcoin but like
[71:01] personally what I think I could talk
[71:02] about uh on a a different type of
[71:04] podcast is like um music and I'm I used
[71:09] to really go to see like concerts all
[71:11] the time um and so that includes like
[71:14] the bands like Grateful Dead and fish so
[71:16] like jam bands where I would like travel
[71:18] around and like go to these concerts and
[71:21] so like if you if something I could just
[71:23] like go on and on about is like music
[71:26] and events and musicians and things like
[71:28] that I'm not a musician personally but
[71:30] that's like one of my interests and I
[71:31] would love to talk to people about that
[71:33] and that's actually part of my like
[71:35] Twitter handle is like Bitcoin fan with
[71:37] a pH and fish fans the band fish is
[71:40] spelled with a pH and so that's also
[71:42] that's kind of where that came from so
[71:44] that's something that like I could nerd
[71:46] out up on for a
[71:47] while ah super interesting I asked that
[71:50] question uh intentionally because I
[71:52] think Bitcoin will be boring at some
[71:54] point
[71:56] and at some point all of of us like all
[71:59] bitcoiners we need a different identity
[72:02] than just being a bitcoiner because it's
[72:05] like oh yeah I'm a t TCP guy that's
[72:09] boring you don't want to be that guy uh
[72:12] but now it's cool to be a Bitcoin at
[72:14] least I think so but I'm biased maybe uh
[72:17] but I think at some point it will be
[72:19] very boring to just be a Bitcoin and you
[72:21] have to get something more to your
[72:23] identity and I got to know that actually
[72:26] Bitcoin has have a lot going on besides
[72:29] that and I kind of want to uncover and
[72:32] discover some of those identities and
[72:35] some of those things uh uh next to it
[72:37] and for example for Lisa Huff that was
[72:39] really funny because I asked her that
[72:40] question she answered with parenting
[72:42] actually and that she's also talking
[72:44] about that at bitb boom uh and then uh
[72:49] the second round with her the second
[72:50] episode that did her we only talked
[72:52] about parenting a whole episode around
[72:54] parenting and the bit coers loved it
[72:56] because it was two bitcoiners talking
[72:57] about bit uh about parenting uh and we I
[73:01] think we talked I think we named Bitcoin
[73:04] like three times an episode this episode
[73:06] probably has like 50 times Bitcoin or
[73:08] like 100 times Bitcoin in them uh so
[73:12] that I think that's really important
[73:13] that we develop other identities uh next
[73:16] to bitcoin also totally I have a feeling
[73:18] that your guest wouldn't love an hourong
[73:20] episode of me talking about fish but
[73:22] that's just my own personal
[73:25] but like in in terms of of like topics
[73:28] and things like that I mean one thing I
[73:30] love about Bitcoin events and hanging
[73:32] out with bitcoiners is often the
[73:34] conversation is rarely about Bitcoin
[73:37] it's about life and just being with
[73:40] other people that have a shared value
[73:41] system and to me that's why I love going
[73:43] to bitcoin events Bitcoin 2025 in Las
[73:47] Vegas is going to be awesome it's going
[73:49] to be our biggest event yet it's going
[73:51] to have some of the most the biggest
[73:53] speakers some of the most interesting
[73:55] people and on just like a ton of
[73:59] phenomenal developers and cultural icons
[74:02] artists all these people in the space
[74:04] and so I think that like coming to that
[74:06] event is going to be potentially
[74:09] life-changing for some people I actually
[74:10] just saw a post uh last night where
[74:13] somebody talked about meeting their now
[74:16] fiance at Bitcoin
[74:19] 2023 and so it's like come to the come
[74:22] to bitcoin 2025 you might meet your
[74:24] soulmate so I I think that like coming
[74:26] to inperson events are just like uh
[74:29] lifechanging and so I'm really looking
[74:31] forward to to hanging out with you um we
[74:34] didn't really get to hang out in in Abu
[74:36] Dhabi but I'm hoping we can actually
[74:38] drop in hang out a little bit uh Ed in
[74:40] Vegas and I'm looking forward to seeing
[74:42] a ton of people there will be will be
[74:45] super fun um is there anything that you
[74:48] can can share with us that uh you can
[74:50] already uh say about the event uh any
[74:53] any names that you're really excited
[74:55] about uh and stuff like that yeah so
[74:58] currently all of the speakers that we
[75:01] have um onboarded or who are confirmed
[75:04] speaking at the event are on the website
[75:06] like we often will like drip them out
[75:07] and like kind of slowly announce but
[75:09] currently they're all you can find all
[75:11] of them posted online um so one that I'm
[75:15] personally really interested and excited
[75:16] by is uh is um John Perkins who is the
[75:22] author of confessions of an economic
[75:24] Hitman and that book I believe the
[75:27] original one came out like in maybe it
[75:30] was I don't even want to guess when it
[75:32] came out I I don't remember exactly but
[75:34] I read that book in I think
[75:38] 2013 maybe and it really prepared me to
[75:41] be a bitcoiner I didn't I didn't get
[75:43] into Bitcoin until later but that book
[75:45] came uh when when I read that book it
[75:47] really prepared me to be a bitcoiner and
[75:50] Alex gladstein most recent book um
[75:52] hidden repression also references that
[75:55] book so uh I'm really excited for that
[75:57] author and you've already got it pulled
[75:59] up I mean we've got some really awesome
[76:01] names and it's like we're five months
[76:02] out from the event so these names are
[76:05] going to be even bigger than what we've
[76:07] got on there right now which and I would
[76:09] say these are all really exciting ones
[76:12] already yeah I just talked with the prod
[76:14] of Gran kadon uh I think Gary kadon was
[76:18] already two times on my show and I
[76:21] talked also the the 100K part with Gary
[76:23] again he's really interested and yeah
[76:25] Grant uh will be really fun to to to see
[76:28] his brother who's seemingly finally
[76:31] really coming in in full proportions to
[76:33] the Bitcoin Howard ludik cind Lumes
[76:36] obviously Michael Z really interesting
[76:38] guests I love to see that really cool
[76:41] then we come to the our end routine of
[76:44] of the podcast uh which is where the
[76:46] previous guest is asking a question for
[76:48] next guest without knowing who the next
[76:50] guest actually is um and and your your
[76:54] question is interesting it's a long
[76:56] question uh but but I think an
[76:59] interesting one how might future
[77:01] textbooks on the history of Economics
[77:04] portray the people of the early 21st
[77:06] century living on a world before the
[77:09] widespread adoption of Bitcoin so
[77:11] basically how will the future look at us
[77:14] wow that's an very interesting
[77:17] question um I think the those textbooks
[77:21] will look at the the lifestyle of of of
[77:27] the
[77:28] current of us as people that had to live
[77:34] um with a lot of debt paycheck to
[77:37] paycheck um potentially making
[77:40] sacrifices or tradeoffs in their Quality
[77:45] quality of life so things like food or
[77:48] health care or um even just like cars or
[77:54] things like that like just they people
[77:57] had to make tradeoffs because they
[77:59] really couldn't afford to to live and I
[78:03] think that we're going to see a huge
[78:06] shift with that with now with like the
[78:09] The Invention and development of of AI
[78:13] and Bitcoin and those two things
[78:15] together I think are going to really
[78:17] create um a a totally new direction for
[78:23] abundance and I think that that Bitcoin
[78:27] especially is is going to create
[78:29] abundance for for many people which is
[78:32] um it's kind of paradoxical because
[78:35] bitcoin's digital scarcity but that's
[78:38] also what leads to this like abundance
[78:40] for for everyone so um I I don't think
[78:43] it's going to be you know everyone's
[78:45] going to have the same amount of
[78:46] abundance but I think that there will be
[78:49] a a Improvement in the quality of life
[78:52] for everybody uh now that Bitcoin
[78:56] exists that's uh that's that's I think a
[78:59] great look really cool um yeah thank you
[79:01] so much Greg already for for being on
[79:03] the show uh and and and contributing to
[79:06] this podcast also thank you so much for
[79:08] everyone that is watching and listening
