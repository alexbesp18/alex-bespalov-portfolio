[00:00] voting for Cala is just voting for a
[00:02] continuation of the existing hostile
[00:05] policy towards the industry it's
[00:08] capitalism under a Bitcoin standard or
[00:10] it's communism under a central bank
[00:12] digital currency you have one side whose
[00:15] Pro Bitcoin they've made it a part of
[00:17] their official party platform and I'm
[00:19] talking about RFK Jr and I'm talking
[00:21] about Donald Trump as someone who cares
[00:24] about the industry in the United States
[00:26] yeah I hope Trump wins Bitcoin over
[00:28] party not party over Bitcoin the fact
[00:30] that you're putting a Fiat political
[00:32] party over Bitcoin is naive once the
[00:35] Bitcoin industry thrives fix the money
[00:37] fix the world baby imagine the thing
[00:40] that you're saving in is consistently
[00:42] losing value every single day you're
[00:45] putting all your energy and your time
[00:47] and your work into earning effing paper
[00:49] they've sced everyone into believing
[00:52] that somehow money has to lose
[00:55] purchasing power to work the reason that
[00:58] Bitcoin is so powerful is because it
[01:00] doesn't require democracy you as an
[01:03] individual can start living on a sound
[01:06] money standard and all of a sudden even
[01:09] if the people around you just don't
[01:10] believe you you're just like all right
[01:12] don't believe me like my life is getting
[01:14] better every single person that is
[01:16] actively holding Bitcoin is now working
[01:18] for
[01:19] [Music]
[01:22] you how do you see Bitcoin changing the
[01:26] relationship between governments and
[01:27] their
[01:28] citizens yeah I think I think it changes
[01:31] like fundamentally like how Society
[01:34] organizes itself
[01:36] because before most people they've
[01:40] custodi their wealth with institutions
[01:44] and custodians and there's really only a
[01:46] handful of them and that makes it very
[01:49] easy for governments to not only seize
[01:52] those assets but also deputize those
[01:55] institutions or
[01:56] custodians uh to enforce certain types
[02:00] of policy whether that's reporting
[02:02] whether that's like you know these these
[02:04] crazy life for example like in the
[02:05] United States they passed the bank
[02:08] secrecy act back in the 1970s and part
[02:10] of the bank secrecy Act was that every
[02:14] $10,000 uh transaction or more had to be
[02:17] reported to the government what people
[02:20] forget though is that back in the 1970s
[02:23] if you adjust for inflation $110,000 is
[02:26] the equivalent of $80,000 wor the
[02:28] purchasing power today
[02:30] so that number stayed the same in fact
[02:34] in the inflation reduction bill that
[02:36] they tried to pass uh they did pass but
[02:38] this part didn't wasn't included in the
[02:40] bill they tried to includ include a
[02:42] clause where every $600 transaction had
[02:45] to be reported right so as an American
[02:47] this is against the Fourth Amendment
[02:49] which is know unreasonable searches and
[02:50] seizures like why do we live in a
[02:52] society where the government has to know
[02:53] every single transaction that's
[02:55] happening and how is that somehow
[02:57] contributing to my safety so
[03:00] it's very difficult for them and you see
[03:02] them kind of missing with messing with
[03:04] the language a little bit it's going to
[03:06] be very difficult for them to
[03:09] control uh peer-to-peer transactions and
[03:12] you're already seeing them react to uh
[03:14] peer-to-peer information right like this
[03:16] is why they hate Twitter so much like
[03:18] this is why they hate social media so
[03:20] much and they why they want to censor it
[03:22] was because before social media like
[03:25] there was only a handful of custodians
[03:27] there was only a handful of media
[03:29] Outlets of which they can co-opt and
[03:32] they can control the narrative now when
[03:34] you have millions upon millions of
[03:36] people like what we're doing right now
[03:37] talking directly it becomes very
[03:40] difficult to scop the population into
[03:43] believing a single narrative and now all
[03:45] of a sudden people start to ask very
[03:47] difficult questions and they don't have
[03:48] really good responses to that so their
[03:51] knee-jerk reaction is like we have to
[03:53] censor more this is a danger to
[03:54] democracy it's like how is conversation
[03:57] a danger to democracy like what what is
[04:00] going on there so um a lot of things are
[04:03] happening I would say really the way
[04:07] that I phrase it is the great dis
[04:10] intermediation the internet started the
[04:12] fire information came first and money is
[04:16] now happening we're starting to seep
[04:19] into that and it's just going to empower
[04:22] the individual the likes of which human
[04:24] history has never seen before the fact
[04:26] that you can memorize 12 to 24 words and
[04:29] you can take millions billions trillions
[04:32] of dollars with you you can memorize it
[04:34] even though I don't suggest that is
[04:37] incredibly powerful and I think that's
[04:40] going to shift the balance of power from
[04:43] the state back to the individual and I
[04:46] don't think we've ever lived in that
[04:48] type of society before but I'm extremely
[04:51] excited for it do you think the nation
[04:53] states will become more service-based as
[04:57] uh the individual gets empowered and
[04:59] they don't have real power over them I
[05:02] think that's the theory right that's
[05:04] like that's what we believe from The
[05:06] Sovereign like if you read The Sovereign
[05:07] indidual which I'm I'm absolutely
[05:09] certain that you have and most
[05:11] bitcoiners have uh that's the theory
[05:13] right as there's more competition
[05:15] between different
[05:17] jurisdictions um it it becomes kind of
[05:19] like a soft forcing function onto them
[05:22] where they now have to compete for
[05:24] Citizens because if not the citizens
[05:26] just get up and leave and take all their
[05:28] wealth with them however ever I think
[05:31] they're not just going to that model
[05:33] isn't just going to go gently into that
[05:35] good night and what I'm seeing now
[05:38] lately and I've really noticed this
[05:40] trend over the last six months and I
[05:43] just kind of been having these thoughts
[05:45] and there's really two models in front
[05:47] of us um one of the things that I always
[05:49] say is Bitcoin or slavery a lot of
[05:51] people interpret it as this hyperbolic
[05:53] statement it's really not and when I
[05:56] mean slavery like we have two economic
[05:59] models that we're we're we're we're
[06:01] steamrolling ahead to and they're very
[06:04] uncomfortable for a lot of bitcoiners
[06:05] bitcoiners are like I don't want to talk
[06:06] about politics but I think it's
[06:07] incredibly important to talk about it's
[06:10] it's capitalism under a Bitcoin standard
[06:14] or it's communism under a central bank
[06:16] digital currency those are the like that
[06:18] is where the world is heading do we want
[06:21] to live in China or do we want to live
[06:24] in a free kind of Market Society I don't
[06:28] believe there's going to be an between
[06:30] and I think as time progresses that's
[06:32] going to become more and more and more
[06:35] obvious so just having this utopian view
[06:38] of like no bitcoin's going to fix
[06:40] everything and everything's going to be
[06:42] fine I think people
[06:45] underestimate the tumultuous times that
[06:48] are ahead of us in order for us to live
[06:51] in the world that we want to live in or
[06:55] we're just all going to have to move to
[06:56] Els salador right but I bet you that if
[06:59] there's enough countries that are under
[07:01] a cbdc standard they'll see El Salvador
[07:05] as a threat so you want multiple
[07:08] countries that are pro Bitcoin and are
[07:11] pushing and are pro Bitcoin are pro
[07:13] business pro- free market Pro uh private
[07:17] property you want more countries
[07:19] following the those footsteps you don't
[07:22] want more countries following in the
[07:24] footsteps of China and as time
[07:26] progresses it seems like a lot of
[07:28] countries are looking at China CH and at
[07:30] least their politicians maybe not their
[07:32] citizens but their politicians are
[07:34] looking over and they're saying you know
[07:36] what that looks like a pretty good idea
[07:38] we should bring that over here you know
[07:40] so I think that's what's at stake but
[07:43] it's on to us like our destiny is in our
[07:45] hands like don't ask what you can do for
[07:47] Bitcoin ask what don't ask what Bitcoin
[07:49] could do for you ask what you can do for
[07:51] Bitcoin that's amazing because um we
[07:54] discussed it a little bit before and
[07:55] then I really want to get into this
[07:57] topic with you as we Bitcoin attend to
[08:00] say like oh Bitcoin doesn't care Bitcoin
[08:03] will do it anyways and to a certain
[08:05] extent it's it's true but not to the
[08:07] full extent as when we come to this
[08:10] topic we like you you are a physical
[08:13] person you are in a in a country and
[08:16] maybe they cannot do anything to bitcoin
[08:18] directly but they can do a lot to you so
[08:21] politics matter for you personally you
[08:24] have to kind of make a stand for you and
[08:26] there's then also the the thing like oh
[08:28] you can add flee to Salvador as you
[08:30] mentioned but you can also stay and
[08:32] fight in your country for better
[08:35] policies better things and it's it's a
[08:37] hard thing to do
[08:38] because when you're in Austria it's it's
[08:40] easier to fight like there's a lot more
[08:42] freedom going on in Austria but what if
[08:45] you are in North Korea or China then
[08:48] then the conversation a whole different
[08:49] one um do you advocate for for fighting
[08:52] in in your country for for better um
[08:55] stance to have it worldwide uh and all
[08:59] Al in in that question when we have
[09:02] those roads that you painted like the
[09:04] one road with cbdcs and the one road
[09:06] with Bitcoin do you imagine that at some
[09:08] point the whole world will be on either
[09:10] one of that or could that be like oh
[09:12] like 40% of the world is there and 60%
[09:15] of the world is there could there be
[09:16] like there's a freedom world but there's
[09:19] also a cbdc world how do you see that
[09:22] yeah I think you know it's a the world's
[09:24] a big place um so I think that there's
[09:27] always going to be corners of the Earth
[09:29] Earth that you know are either fullon
[09:33] collectivist society and there's always
[09:35] going to be corners of the Earth where
[09:37] you know there's going to be freedom but
[09:39] that freedom maybe isn't because of the
[09:41] government but maybe it's because of the
[09:42] lack of government there right um but
[09:46] what I will say is like just just like
[09:49] let's take a look at history right so
[09:51] the you know the 20th century was
[09:55] essentially especially the later half of
[09:57] the 20th century was a fight between two
[10:00] opposing not only political ideologies
[10:03] but economic
[10:05] ideologies uh we thought in the 99s that
[10:08] it was it was over with the downfall of
[10:10] the
[10:11] USSR what we didn't realize is you know
[10:14] they they rebranded a lot of these
[10:17] collectivist ideologies um you know
[10:19] instead of it making a class struggle
[10:22] they made it about race uh they made it
[10:24] about sexuality and they kind of
[10:26] rebranded it a little bit and that seems
[10:29] to have been a little bit more
[10:30] successful in terms of picking up
[10:32] popularity in the west and what I will
[10:35] say as well
[10:38] is uh if you look at the rise of China
[10:41] right uh China what they realized is
[10:44] that they couldn't have a top down
[10:47] economy so they took a they essentially
[10:50] have a free market economy with like
[10:52] this kind of like fascistic government
[10:54] right but it's still communist
[10:56] government with branding but it's really
[10:58] kind of like a fascist F fascistic
[11:00] government and what I'm seeing in the
[11:02] west is a little bit troubling because
[11:04] it's like we're all kind of just like
[11:07] like you know moving toward that
[11:10] direction the Canadian truckers protest
[11:12] is a great example of that right the
[11:14] people were just having a you know
[11:16] political protest and they just started
[11:18] shutting down their bank accounts now
[11:20] what does all of this have to do with
[11:22] anything those types of totalitarian
[11:24] governments are only possible and this
[11:27] is the fifth tenant in the Communist man
[11:29] esto they're only
[11:31] possible when you have the
[11:33] centralization of credit meaning a
[11:35] central bank if you take away the
[11:38] Central Bank you take away the state's
[11:41] ability to effectively redistribute
[11:43] wealth so you can't have a collectivist
[11:46] society you can't have a society where
[11:48] politicians are basically promising
[11:51] their voters free things because the
[11:53] only way for a government to raise
[11:56] revenue under a Bitcoin standard is via
[11:59] direct taxation you can only bring that
[12:02] up so high until people are just like
[12:04] you know what I don't care about the war
[12:05] in Ukraine right the reason that they're
[12:07] able to get away with the funding is
[12:10] because they're able to get away with
[12:12] the indirect taxation of inflation so I
[12:15] don't think we've we've uh that that
[12:18] type of discourse has reached the
[12:19] mainstream yet but anyways to answer
[12:22] your question I think we're going to
[12:23] have like I think that this century is
[12:26] going to be very similar to the last
[12:28] century but instead of like these proxy
[12:31] kinetic Wars I think it's going to be
[12:34] more information Warfare uh more than
[12:37] anything like what type of information
[12:40] are you
[12:40] consuming uh you know what what what do
[12:43] you know what do you not know because I
[12:45] truly believed I believe that the people
[12:48] that are in collectivist societies I
[12:51] think that if they knew the full picture
[12:54] they wouldn't be okay with it I think
[12:56] the reason that they're okay with it is
[12:59] because they've been
[13:00] propagandized to believe what it is that
[13:03] the guy in the suit on TV with an emblem
[13:07] behind him is saying rather than what
[13:10] the truth actually
[13:12] is that's so interesting uh just at the
[13:15] thought in my mind when we have a
[13:17] information Warfare are then content
[13:19] creators and podcast H and all those
[13:22] things then the new soldiers of of the
[13:24] new war absolutely I mean I've said this
[13:27] but I said this at the I think it was
[13:28] Bitcoin 2022 or 2023 I said it I said if
[13:33] memes are if uh if tweets are bullets
[13:37] memes are artillery in this narrative
[13:39] trench warfare that we're fighting in
[13:41] the Battlegrounds of the internet you're
[13:43] absolutely a Frontline Soldier and You
[13:45] by making content what you're doing is
[13:48] you're leveraging the power of the
[13:49] internet to get this conversation out to
[13:52] as many voices with the hopes of waking
[13:56] people up and getting them on the side
[13:59] team orange because a lot of people are
[14:01] are lost in the sauce when they say oh
[14:04] it's liberal vers conservative it's left
[14:06] vers right no no no no no whatever
[14:08] government is power whether in power
[14:10] whether it's left or right they do the
[14:11] same thing they print
[14:13] money what the actual battle at hand is
[14:16] is the Battle of Team Green Team Fiat
[14:20] team Central Bank digital currency team
[14:22] slavery team nihilism team War versus
[14:25] Team orange which is Team Hope team
[14:28] Prosperity team team peace team
[14:31] opportunity right it's you know it's
[14:33] it's it's like I don't want to say good
[14:35] or versus evil because it's kind of
[14:36] cliche but that's really the battle at
[14:39] hand and what's winning for us like why
[14:43] I believe we're going to win at the end
[14:45] is because their team is requires
[14:50] coercion and co-opting of the narrative
[14:53] in order for it to be for it to be a a
[14:56] for it to be a winning message people
[14:59] don't once people like see I'll put it
[15:02] to you this way have you ever met
[15:04] someone who has transitioned to a
[15:07] Bitcoin standard that has come back to
[15:09] Fiat and says I miss Fiat like oh I love
[15:13] the dollar I love the Euro it was great
[15:15] it was phenomenal I love what the
[15:17] government is doing no it's a one-way
[15:20] door so their hope is to stop as many
[15:24] people as coming to team orange as they
[15:27] humanly can and that's why you're
[15:29] starting to see all these attacks on
[15:32] self- custody that's why you're seeing
[15:34] the arrest of privacy developers that's
[15:36] why you're seeing lightning wallet
[15:38] companies exiting the US right that's
[15:40] what that's what's happening here and by
[15:43] the way one last point this was all
[15:46] predicted if you book if you read the
[15:48] book The sovereign individual everything
[15:50] that's happening right now was predicted
[15:52] by that book and it was very very
[15:54] accurate they didn't get everything
[15:55] right but they got a lot of things right
[15:57] it's it's so interesting you know look
[15:59] at some history books and the history um
[16:02] things that happened and then predicted
[16:04] the future um do we have to kind of like
[16:08] let's come now to the US election and to
[16:11] to the to the world right now um you
[16:14] said in the beginning that you think
[16:16] that we now have to uh pick and choose a
[16:20] side and we have to be uh to a certain
[16:22] extent political and like really fight
[16:24] for for our our freedom um how how is
[16:29] that now AFF affecting the US election
[16:33] yeah so it it's a couple things so it's
[16:36] a very tough pill to swallow for some
[16:38] bitcoiners because bitcoiners are
[16:40] inherently anti-state and they've
[16:42] already lost faith in elections and
[16:44] they've already lost faith in the
[16:46] political system rightly so um and I and
[16:49] I empathize with that but at the same
[16:52] time you know traditional Fiat elections
[16:56] still have
[16:57] consequences right now you have and I've
[17:01] been covering this for the last year or
[17:03] so you have one side who's Pro Bitcoin
[17:09] right they've made it a part of their
[17:10] official party platform uh and I'm
[17:13] talking about RFK Jr and I'm talking
[17:15] about Donald Trump it's part of the
[17:18] Republican Party platform it says
[17:19] protect the right to self- custody
[17:21] protect the right to mine you know fire
[17:24] Gary gendler Trump had the speech at the
[17:27] at the Bitcoin conference RFK had the
[17:29] speech at the Bitcoin
[17:31] conference and then on the other side
[17:34] which is quite interesting because it's
[17:37] an election year and they obviously
[17:39] don't want bitcoiners to vote against
[17:41] them so they're kind of walking it back
[17:43] with their rhetoric and their wording
[17:45] and they're saying crypto for Caris and
[17:47] all that stuff but if you actually take
[17:49] a look at their
[17:51] actions you're talking about a proposed
[17:54] 30% tax on bitcoin miners you're talking
[17:57] about operation choke point 2.0 you're
[18:00] talking about Caitlyn long's the first
[18:02] fully reserved Bitcoin Bank in the
[18:05] United States based out of Wyoming
[18:07] denied a Federal Banking
[18:09] Charter she told me when she came on my
[18:11] podcast that that order came directly
[18:13] from the White House the attack on self-
[18:15] custody the arrest of of open-source
[18:20] developers including the developer of
[18:21] tornado cash and the tornado the
[18:24] developers of of uh of of Samurai right
[18:29] selling setting precedence basically
[18:31] saying if you develop software uh you
[18:34] can go to prison uh another thing uh the
[18:37] promise of RFK and Trump to free Ross
[18:40] alri you know but Kamala is basically
[18:43] saying like I love bitcoiners but she
[18:45] can do that right now she's part of the
[18:46] executive branch what's stopping her
[18:48] right um so what else uh you had the
[18:51] arrest of Roger ver you had the arrest
[18:53] of CZ you had the essentially like it's
[18:57] Le uh Arthur Hayes and you could say oh
[18:59] no those guys are CEOs of shitcoin
[19:02] casinos they deserve it it's like okay
[19:04] fine you can say that but we all have to
[19:07] remember what happened in
[19:09] 2008 2008 financial crisis where Main
[19:12] Street bailed out Wall Street no
[19:16] significant Banker went to jail for the
[19:19] crimes that they committed so we're
[19:21] playing by a different set of
[19:23] rules than the bureaucrats and the
[19:26] central Bankers right so so this
[19:29] election is essentially do you want a
[19:32] pro Bitcoin anti- cbdc president in the
[19:36] white house or do you want a anti-b
[19:39] Bitcoin Pro cbdc president in the White
[19:43] House and connect this with what I was
[19:46] saying earlier on in the
[19:48] show what future do you want do you want
[19:51] a future of Bitcoin or do you want a
[19:53] future of slavery and unfortunately what
[19:57] a lot of bitcoiners don't
[19:59] understand is that this election in the
[20:02] United States it's going to have
[20:04] significant
[20:05] consequences not for the death of
[20:07] Bitcoin Bitcoin doesn't need a
[20:09] politician to survive Bitcoin is anti-
[20:11] fragile politicians need Bitcoin to
[20:14] survive not the other way around so I
[20:15] just want to specify that but for the
[20:18] regulatory environment and for the
[20:21] business environment and on and then
[20:23] frankly like just for just if you're a
[20:25] Bitcoin or living in the United States
[20:28] this election will have significant
[20:31] consequences on you as a business owner
[20:34] as a bitcoiner as an entrepreneur as
[20:36] someone who's running a lightning wallet
[20:38] I mean you've already seen this you've
[20:41] seen wallet of Satoshi you've seen
[20:43] Phoenix wallet could you believe that
[20:45] the United States of America that that
[20:47] literally advertises itself as the land
[20:49] of the free Home of the Brave and the
[20:53] other countries where lightning wallets
[20:55] aren't available are North Korea and
[20:57] China and United unit States is somehow
[20:59] on that list like that's insane and
[21:02] that's due to the regulatory environment
[21:06] which is coming from the current
[21:08] executive branch so voting for Kamala is
[21:11] just voting for a continuation of the
[21:15] existing hostile policy towards the
[21:17] industry and then voting for Trump or
[21:20] RFK is literally they said it at the
[21:23] conference like I will fire Gary gendler
[21:25] I will end the attack on on bitcoin and
[21:28] industry you know like drill baby drill
[21:31] let's mine like all this stuff like all
[21:33] these good things that are pro-industry
[21:35] that's what's on the line and that's a
[21:38] very uncomfortable conversation for a
[21:39] lot of bitcoiners because they hate
[21:41] politics but my message to them is you
[21:44] might hate politics you might pretend
[21:46] politics isn't there but politics sure
[21:49] does know you're there and it sure does
[21:51] care about you right so yeah if look
[21:55] we're serious about this being the world
[21:57] Reserve currency and I think a lot of
[21:59] bitcoiners are you got to ask yourself
[22:02] like eventually this was always going to
[22:04] happen we had the advantage of being
[22:06] able to play in the shadows for the
[22:08] early years of bitcoin's history but if
[22:11] we're really serious about this becoming
[22:13] the world Reserve currency these types
[22:16] of political clashes were an
[22:19] inevitability there were there it was
[22:21] always going to happen it was just a
[22:22] matter of when do do you think uh and I
[22:25] think you have more insights in the
[22:27] American politics than me do you think
[22:29] that Trump and RFK have to join forces
[22:31] at some point because like it feels like
[22:33] RFK could uh steal a lot of votes from
[22:37] uh Trump and maybe that's like the
[22:39] deciding votes
[22:41] against then uh having a Harris uh
[22:45] presidency yeah so
[22:48] um there was actually a thing that came
[22:51] out
[22:53] today um where you had the VP of rfk's
[22:58] Campa
[22:59] basically say that she is deciding
[23:03] whether to bow out and
[23:06] support Donald Trump or uh you know or
[23:12] or stay in the race and fend to making a
[23:16] third party like that's essentially what
[23:18] she's saying right now um
[23:22] and and you know I think she sees the
[23:25] writing on the wall I think so too I I
[23:28] think
[23:29] RFK is doing a great job and uh would
[23:31] have a hard time deciding between those
[23:33] two uh because uh like RFK feels as the
[23:36] better choice but then there's also this
[23:38] strategic thinking of of avoiding a
[23:41] haris uh thing so like that's that's
[23:44] interesting it was said on a podcast so
[23:46] like she's literally said this today on
[23:48] a podcast like it the clip is has been
[23:50] making rounds on Twitter where it's
[23:52] she's basically and this is the VP of
[23:54] the RFK campaign where she's basically
[23:56] like look like we either run as a third
[23:58] party and we try to get 5% of the vote
[24:01] or we throw in the towel and endorse
[24:04] Trump you know so like I personally as
[24:08] someone who and again I I hate the whole
[24:11] liberal conservative right vers blue
[24:13] thing but as someone who cares about the
[24:17] industry in the United States as a
[24:19] Bitcoin entrepreneur in the United
[24:20] States like yeah I hope Trump wins you
[24:23] know and again what I just said is very
[24:27] inflammatory to a lot of people and what
[24:30] the messaging that I kept saying is like
[24:32] guys Bitcoin over party not party over
[24:36] Bitcoin like the fact that you're
[24:38] putting a Fiat political party over
[24:41] Bitcoin Bitcoin fixes these things is na
[24:45] like Bitcoin fixes a lot of the the
[24:49] issues that Society is currently
[24:51] enduring and those issues fundamentally
[24:55] stem from broken money broken money is
[24:59] okay the quality of food the quality of
[25:01] products the fact that people can't
[25:03] afford housing the fact that people
[25:05] can't afford for the future this
[25:07] nihilistic mindset this depression
[25:10] short-term thinking the most of the
[25:13] world is operating under that that
[25:16] software right bitcoiners think about it
[25:20] it's like like life is awesome it things
[25:22] just get cheaper over time I just get
[25:24] wealthier this is great this is
[25:26] phenomenal right so
[25:29] so like if you're voting against Trump
[25:33] you're essentially like voting for more
[25:37] of the same [ __ ] that we've endured
[25:40] over these many many years not because
[25:44] of Trump's policies On the Border or
[25:47] immigration or any of the you know the I
[25:51] don't even want to say it like the all
[25:52] the you all the things that you hear all
[25:54] the time on the news like oh you know
[25:56] abor all this such garbage I don't care
[25:59] like do what you want like none of that
[26:01] matters what matters is is that you have
[26:04] the president of the most powerful
[26:06] country in the
[26:07] world creating a positive environment
[26:11] for the Bitcoin industry to
[26:14] thrive once the Bitcoin industry thrives
[26:17] fix the money fix the world baby that's
[26:20] the way that I'm seeing it and that's
[26:21] the way that I see it as a single-issue
[26:23] voter and I hope people wake up to that
[26:26] reality to that fact I love that a lot
[26:28] that that that was just an amazing thing
[26:32] um maybe let's do uh one thing now what
[26:36] what happens if this this thing does not
[26:39] work out and the the cdbc route uh wins
[26:42] what if like people are too uh
[26:46] convenient to actually do the self-
[26:48] custody all Bitcoin are centralized on
[26:50] on exchanges and ETFs and all those
[26:53] things the war on privacy and the war on
[26:55] on on peerto peer was successful would
[26:59] um would that mean that if cbdcs wins uh
[27:03] if centralization wins if uh no privacy
[27:06] vs and all those things would that mean
[27:09] that Bitcoin breaks and was unsuccessful
[27:12] is that even a in a route that we could
[27:14] go towards no no I I think even in the
[27:18] US like even if Camala wins like you
[27:21] know the one of the things I'm a first
[27:23] generation American so I I I migrated to
[27:26] the to the country from Venezuela right
[27:29] and one of the things that's awesome
[27:30] about the United States and it always
[27:33] makes it very difficult for totalitarian
[27:35] governments to completely a central
[27:38] totalitarian government to completely
[27:40] dictate the rest of the country is for
[27:42] three reasons reason number one is
[27:45] freedom of speech right so our ability
[27:47] to speak freely is protected the
[27:50] government is not supposed to censor you
[27:53] uh they try to do it through private
[27:54] companies but they can't do it directly
[27:56] themselves if you have open discourse
[27:59] and you can't sh you can't shut down
[28:00] ideas you're forced to debate them
[28:03] that's number one number two my personal
[28:05] favorite is the Second Amendment so the
[28:07] right to bear arms uh the United States
[28:10] is the most heavily armed country on the
[28:12] face of the planet the citizens have a
[28:15] lot of guns meaning if the government
[28:17] ever tries to come up with something
[28:20] that is like so
[28:22] insane they're going to question it
[28:24] because they're going to fear for their
[28:25] own lives right they're going to be like
[28:27] okay maybe it's not a good idea to go
[28:30] door too and try to confiscate people's
[28:32] wealth that guy might have two AR-15s
[28:35] like maybe let's leave that alone right
[28:38] that's number two number three is the
[28:41] federal system so each individual State
[28:45] Works kind of like its own separate
[28:47] country with its own separate laws and
[28:51] that's only going to accelerate because
[28:54] one of the things that keeps a lot of
[28:56] these countries together even though
[28:58] they don't have a lot of things in
[28:59] common is the money right so like the
[29:02] money kind of functions as this glue but
[29:06] what starts to happen if if a state
[29:08] starts to put Bitcoin on its treasury
[29:10] what happens if a state says okay you
[29:12] know the state of Texas is making
[29:14] Bitcoin legal tender the federal
[29:15] government say no no no you can't do
[29:17] that that's already happened before
[29:19] where has that happened that has
[29:21] happened in the marijuana industry so
[29:23] marijuana is illegal on a federal level
[29:26] in the United States multiple States
[29:29] including California Colorado Washington
[29:33] just to name a few there's many more
[29:35] basically said no marijuana is legal
[29:38] this is fine so the federal government
[29:40] is is stuck in a predicament where it's
[29:43] still illegal in a federal level but the
[29:44] states are allowing the industries to
[29:46] thrive I think if Bitcoin has trouble on
[29:50] the federal level it's going to continue
[29:53] to succeed on the state level and also
[29:56] shout out to Dennis Porter because he's
[29:57] done pretty pretty good job on this and
[29:59] essentially he's he's pushed forward on
[30:02] in many different states making it uh
[30:06] making the right to self- custody and
[30:08] the right to mine protected by the
[30:11] states right so even if oh and this and
[30:14] I forgot to mention this the State of
[30:16] Florida passed the
[30:18] law specifically Banning Central Bank
[30:22] digital currencies right so that's one
[30:25] of the beautiful things about the US is
[30:27] that the St stes act on their own and
[30:31] therefore it creates competition like
[30:33] when New York and California started
[30:36] going down the totalitarian covid
[30:38] shutdown rules a lot of people just left
[30:42] and went to California and Florida where
[30:44] they didn't have those rules so
[30:47] fundamentally it's going to be very very
[30:49] difficult for this like you know full
[30:53] fascist totalitarian government all over
[30:55] the world but that's not to say that you
[30:58] don't want to stand and fight like I
[31:01] love my country I love what it
[31:03] represents I you know maybe I don't like
[31:05] I and I could and I and I speak Spanish
[31:08] I can move till Salvador that's fine but
[31:10] what if I don't want to move what if my
[31:12] family is there what if I just don't
[31:14] want to move what if what if I want to
[31:15] Stand My Ground you know if things get
[31:17] horrible I'll leave that's fine but I
[31:20] don't want to leave like what happened
[31:22] in Venezuela was a tragedy you know like
[31:25] it 20 years of
[31:28] socialism and the country completely
[31:31] destroyed and 8 million Venezuelan this
[31:34] is a country of 29 million people like a
[31:36] third do you understand how many people
[31:38] that is left they just left you know and
[31:41] these are the smartest people these are
[31:43] the most capable people these are the
[31:45] business owners these are the people
[31:46] that have the means and there was a
[31:48] giant brain drain so I don't want that
[31:51] to happen in the US you know so I think
[31:54] it's worth it to fight until you can't
[31:57] fight anymore in my opinion and when I
[31:59] mean fight I mean like information
[32:01] Warfare I don't mean like go and you
[32:04] know do stupid [ __ ] you know and you
[32:07] know like talk and try to convince
[32:09] people of your point of view wait in in
[32:12] Venezuela n million people left yeah
[32:15] yeah it's like it's insane it's more
[32:17] than Austria yeah no the amount of
[32:20] people like I'll I'll I'll I'll double
[32:22] check the exact figure but yes it was
[32:24] millions and millions of people and it's
[32:27] a country
[32:28] of 29 million people oh that's that's
[32:32] that's crazy that's really crazy it's
[32:34] also interesting for me when I look at
[32:36] the states uh because there's also the
[32:38] European Union uh which basically is u a
[32:42] union not as the states uh but it's
[32:46] countries and they also have money like
[32:47] we use the euro so it's a little bit uh
[32:51] comparable and I see it more more
[32:54] failing the EU and failing in a in a in
[32:57] a strong way we have the EU election not
[33:00] that long AG ago and basically all the
[33:02] parties that were critical about the EU
[33:05] were getting way stronger uh than they
[33:07] were before so so the overall consensus
[33:10] is oh yeah we are very critical what the
[33:13] EU is doing and it's a very likely
[33:17] chance that in like the next 50 years
[33:19] the EU is not uh there anymore in the in
[33:23] the form that it is now there do you
[33:27] think that also possibility in the USA
[33:30] that the states actually become their
[33:33] own countries again where there is no
[33:35] real federal government maybe there's
[33:37] like some trade deals between those and
[33:39] and some overall thing but uh what if
[33:42] the US dollar uh collapses away then
[33:45] what's what's binding the states
[33:47] together yeah and that's an excellent
[33:49] question and I just asked chat gbt real
[33:51] quick so yes it it's 7.7 million people
[33:55] in a country of 28 million that's a
[33:59] third that's almost a third right that's
[34:01] insane right that's insane yeah so um
[34:04] just to be accurate with the figures um
[34:06] now in regards to your question I think
[34:08] it's an excellent question I think the
[34:10] US is just going to be regressing to how
[34:13] the country was before the establishment
[34:16] of the Federal Reserve in 1913 so I
[34:19] think the US like it's in the name the
[34:21] United States of America doesn't say
[34:23] it's one big country it's just a bunch
[34:26] of States so I think I think it's
[34:28] perfect like it goes hand inand I think
[34:30] people have this weird conceptual
[34:34] version of what the role of government
[34:38] should be in people's lives and I think
[34:41] that they've had like it's it's it's
[34:44] been misrepresented and and and uh like
[34:49] it's been a it's it's been
[34:51] misrepresented and abused and the reason
[34:53] that politicians have been able to
[34:54] convince so many people of the
[34:56] government canix your problems even
[34:58] though they never do is the money
[35:01] printer the the fact that poit that is I
[35:05] I would say that is one of the most
[35:06] dangerous things Humanity has ever seen
[35:10] politicians with the power of an
[35:12] unlimited money supply so endless Wars
[35:17] programs things that would never stand
[35:20] up on their own economically because
[35:23] they would just run out of money
[35:25] continue to just get funded and funded
[35:28] and funded and funded and funded and it
[35:29] creates all these inefficiencies so I
[35:32] think that if you don't have a money
[35:34] that is you know uh connecting the
[35:38] entire country I I I I don't see the
[35:41] United States the way that the federal
[35:43] government is structured today
[35:45] continuing and back to the European
[35:47] Union you guys have it a little bit
[35:49] worse like Brussels is like holy sh like
[35:52] godamn man they're going full like it's
[35:56] so funny because because they tried to
[35:58] promote and we've been covering this uh
[36:01] they've been trying to promote the cbdc
[36:03] it wasn't very popular they changed the
[36:06] name now it's just called the digital
[36:08] Euro which is exactly the same thing
[36:10] they just dropped the cbdc because they
[36:13] realized how unpopular it was but the
[36:16] amount of power that the bureaucrats in
[36:18] Brussels have is INS they don't care
[36:22] like they asked the people they released
[36:24] the poll do you believe that we need a
[36:26] cbdc the vast majority people like no
[36:28] they're like Christine theard is like
[36:30] we're moving forward with the Democratic
[36:32] process of the cbdc and I'm like holy
[36:34] [ __ ] and then uh the Ursula the Ursula
[36:37] lady comes out she's like Twitter is a
[36:41] threat to democracy and we are going to
[36:43] pass these laws in order to set like and
[36:47] I'm like so and then there was this
[36:49] letter that came out out of the European
[36:52] Union from a EU
[36:54] bureaucrat warning Elon about the
[36:58] Twitter spaces that he was going to have
[37:00] with Trump and if you just break down
[37:02] that to like the basics right just like
[37:05] the very basics of it so you're telling
[37:09] me that a European politician is telling
[37:14] an American an American company that he
[37:17] can or he cannot have a
[37:20] conversation with a potential future
[37:23] president what the f is going on that's
[37:26] insane that's crazy I remember when
[37:28] Tucker had the interview with Putin
[37:31] right they lost their minds and this is
[37:34] what I was talking about like earlier in
[37:37] the very beginning of the show when I
[37:38] said like we're living in this like very
[37:40] pivotal moment in human history where
[37:44] all these power structures are being
[37:46] disintermediated by the internet so it's
[37:49] like before the politician in the EU
[37:51] would have to call what what's a very
[37:53] popular newspaper in Europe I don't know
[37:56] uh I only have Austrian newspapers but I
[37:58] don't read them there they're standard
[38:01] uh it's a popular one but I don't know
[38:03] if there's like European ones actually
[38:05] it's more like country wise so so like
[38:07] the guardian for examp let's let's talk
[38:09] about the the UK ones right like the
[38:10] guardian financial times they would call
[38:13] them and say hey don't run that story
[38:16] and the newspapers would say okay I saw
[38:18] this very popular quote it was so
[38:20] popular said if social media existed
[38:23] back in
[38:25] 2003 the war in Iraq would have never
[38:27] happened because it was the New York
[38:31] Times that released a story that Saddam
[38:36] had weapons of mass destruction it came
[38:39] out about half half a decade later that
[38:43] it was actually the US intelligence
[38:45] agencies that were telling the New York
[38:48] Times that Iraq had weapons of mass
[38:50] destruction so that they can convince
[38:52] the American people that it would be
[38:54] okay to invade Iraq those
[38:58] manipulation mechanisms are no longer
[39:01] there you're living it right now the
[39:03] fact that we're having this conversation
[39:05] and you can post it directly to your
[39:07] audience look at all the things that
[39:09] we're saying that wouldn't be acceptable
[39:11] to a lot of people like this is what I
[39:13] mean and as more and more of the world
[39:17] wakes up to this like new information
[39:20] medium I think we're going to see more
[39:22] and more freedom and it's going to be
[39:24] very difficult for these top down
[39:27] bureaucratic heavy Societies in order to
[39:31] for them to convince society that
[39:33] somehow they're benefiting you like my
[39:36] question to you is as as a European like
[39:39] is Brussels helping you if you watch or
[39:42] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[39:44] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[39:47] and now the most important step is to
[39:49] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[39:53] hardware wallet my personal
[39:54] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[39:56] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[39:59] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[40:01] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[40:04] exchange and you can get a 5% discount

[40:19] security setup and maybe even your
[40:21] citizenship set up you have to talk to

[40:56] and last but not least I have something
[40:58] completely new for you guys I partnered
[41:02] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[41:05] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[41:08] saw created by anyone look at that
[41:11] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[41:13] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[41:17] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[41:20] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[41:22] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[41:26] make sure to check out the link in the
[41:27] description for this amazing coin
[41:30] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[41:32] amazing I love them so much it was
[41:34] really hard for me to pick the one that
[41:36] I want to have because there are a lot
[41:38] of great options I went with the new
[41:41] transparency Edition they're all limited
[41:44] so grab yours those will not be
[41:47] available for a long time but there will
[41:49] come new models and new amazing designs
[41:52] along the way I'm very Envy of the
[41:54] states actually like every time I I
[41:56] speak with with Americans and they're
[41:58] like oh I I don't like the government
[41:59] I'm like hey you you have the better one
[42:03] you have the way better one because in
[42:04] the European election there was not even
[42:06] a word of Bitcoin like this was not even
[42:08] a topic uh like an official topic that
[42:11] was actually discussed by by the leading
[42:13] candidates not on a nation level and not
[42:16] on a on a European level and this was
[42:18] just like really sad to see and then the
[42:20] same time I see States doing it then I
[42:23] see American uh I see the United States
[42:26] saying that oh we will ban cbcs we will
[42:29] not let that happen in the states uh
[42:32] European is like going forward with it
[42:34] and really wanting it and I'm like okay
[42:38] there is in Austria directly next to me
[42:40] Switzerland which is basically Austria
[42:42] just without the European Union from the
[42:45] landscape and stuff like that so like
[42:48] I'm I'm I'm ready if if the European
[42:50] Union is is doing too much uh and if
[42:54] Austria does not do something against it
[42:56] like for austrians very easy and
[42:58] convenient to go to to Switzerland and
[43:01] even if like Switzerland I have a lot of
[43:03] hopes like Al a lot of bitcoiners are
[43:05] actually moving there Lugano uh you're
[43:07] also going there you told me um Lugano
[43:10] is a big place so like I think uh Europe
[43:14] is a really beautiful uh continent like
[43:17] so many beautiful and stunning places uh
[43:20] I I would hate to leave that continent
[43:23] but if I have to at some point uh like
[43:26] with Venezuela you said like so many
[43:28] people left and those were the business
[43:29] owners those were the uh for leaders
[43:31] that left and not the the the bottom uh
[43:34] so yeah it's a it's a sad state of of
[43:37] the European Union uh and I hope uh we
[43:40] can turn this around uh or just do it on
[43:43] a nation level why do we need the
[43:45] European Union Yes we can have like
[43:47] trade agreements we can have all the
[43:49] things that we have uh borders better
[43:52] organized that you don't have to have
[43:55] like a a Visa or something like that if
[43:57] you want to go to to Germany so that's
[44:00] great there like good things about the
[44:01] European Union uh as as a European
[44:04] citizens you can literally go a long way
[44:07] without any any um um obstacle there but
[44:12] there are really bad things about the
[44:14] European Union also and I'm Envy of the
[44:17] United States to be honest like I'm
[44:19] really Envy I would love for Bitcoin to
[44:21] be a topic in Austria in in the European
[44:24] Union but it is not so I'm EnV you yeah
[44:28] I mean but this is why this is why I
[44:30] kept saying like this is this is why we
[44:33] fight like this is why this is what
[44:35] you're doing right now um like you you
[44:38] just started this and you know you're a
[44:40] pretty young guy but one of the things
[44:42] that I've realized making media um you
[44:45] know I started simply I was 27 years old
[44:48] right and a lot of the things that I
[44:51] kept like I kept I had no experience in
[44:54] media no experience in podcasting
[44:55] nothing I was like oh I like I wanted do
[44:57] a podcast one of the things I I kept
[45:00] realizing and is that like we are at the
[45:04] front line of this like we are the
[45:07] soldiers we are the evangelists if it's
[45:11] not us it's not going to be anybody else
[45:14] like and this is where you know like
[45:17] some of the founding fathers in the
[45:19] United States they were men in their
[45:21] late
[45:22] 20s early 30s somewhere in their mid-30s
[45:27] somewhere in their 30s somewhere in
[45:28] their late 30s but the whole point is
[45:30] that they were pretty young men and they
[45:32] were thinking of a revolution what is
[45:35] this but not a revolution like this is
[45:38] the separation of money and state the
[45:41] Europe went through a very kind of
[45:43] pivotal moment in its history I would
[45:45] say it's like the era of the
[45:47] Enlightenment the separation of of of
[45:49] church and state you know the French
[45:52] Revolution horrific um you know but
[45:55] there was two ways like look at how the
[45:57] US had its revolution and look at how
[46:00] the French had its revolution so like
[46:02] the point is though is that now all of a
[46:05] sudden the church doesn't play as as as
[46:08] big of a role in society but before you
[46:12] know the French Revolution before a lot
[46:13] of these revolutions happened like even
[46:15] the one in Russia the church played like
[46:17] a a huge role in society so we are
[46:22] entering this phase and it falls on to
[46:25] our generation
[46:27] and it's a very different type of
[46:29] warfare right before a lot of people
[46:32] just picked up a bunch of guns and
[46:33] they're like all right let's storm the
[46:35] castle get the king you know yeah chop
[46:38] his chop his head off like you know like
[46:40] that that's what people conceive in
[46:42] their minds as What A revolution is in
[46:45] the era of the internet when we're all
[46:47] interconnected and we can have
[46:48] conversations thousands of miles away
[46:51] from each other
[46:52] instantaneously this is Warfare this is
[46:55] Warfare like the other side is going to
[46:58] try to throw [ __ ] at you they're going
[47:00] to tell you cbdcs are good Christine
[47:02] lagard is going to come out here and
[47:03] she's like for the sovereignty of Europe
[47:06] ER we need a cbdc or or the financial
[47:09] stability of the whole content is at
[47:11] risk like it's like no you're [ __ ]
[47:13] lying you your money is the one that's
[47:16] causing Financial instability so that's
[47:19] what I mean is that like we essentially
[47:22] have to speak out and make our voices
[47:24] heard louder than theirs and we're
[47:27] winning we're winning so hard look look
[47:29] at how they react to TW you know what's
[47:31] the most popular downloaded News App
[47:34] application right now in the world it's
[47:37] X it's not CNN it's not New York Times
[47:41] it's not the guardian it's not all the
[47:44] official media sources it's people
[47:48] breaking the news right so we need more
[47:51] of that and the more we get of that the
[47:53] more our movement wins because bit coin
[47:57] is truth and Fiat is a lie and because
[48:00] it's based on a lie not only is it a lie
[48:03] it's based on a lie and it's based on
[48:05] theft because it's based on theft and
[48:07] because it's based on a lie it needs
[48:10] coercion manipulation and narrative
[48:13] control in order to function without
[48:16] those things the truth will win every
[48:19] single time
[48:21] look Bitcoin is going to win because of
[48:24] its incentives when the CCP and Bitcoin
[48:27] mining within its
[48:28] borders the hash rate dropped 50% taking
[48:32] the price down with it right this was
[48:34] the 2021 cycle without any Central
[48:37] Authority CEO nothing
[48:40] nobody the hash rate recovered on its
[48:44] own why bitcoin's incentives Bitcoin has
[48:49] co-opted the human race and human greed
[48:53] in order to ensure its survival and what
[48:56] it's given Humanity in return is
[48:59] prosperity and peace and it changes
[49:02] Humanity's operating system where
[49:05] instead of everyone fighting tooth and
[49:08] nail to get to the top of the Fiat
[49:11] system we now live in a system of
[49:13] aligned incentives so all of a sudden
[49:17] Michael sailor works for you if you're
[49:20] holding Bitcoin El Salvador works for
[49:23] you Max Kaiser works for you Larry f
[49:26] think now works for you your incentives
[49:30] are now aligned with their incentives so
[49:32] these what Larry you see black rock you
[49:35] would see You' perceive it as this evil
[49:38] institution it's not necessarily that it
[49:40] was evil it was playing the games of
[49:43] Fiat and the games of Fiat are evil the
[49:47] games of Fiat are zero sum where Winner
[49:51] Takes all the games of Bitcoin is
[49:54] everyone could win everyone is equal if
[49:58] you want to buy Bitcoin earn Bitcoin you
[50:01] have to get in line and buy Spot Bitcoin
[50:03] like everyone else you can't manipulate
[50:06] the rules to benefit yourself like Fiat
[50:10] so it's a much fairer system and that's
[50:13] what we're fighting for and that and to
[50:15] answer your question because I've been
[50:16] on a r rant um that's why I believe
[50:19] fundamentally these large bureaucracies
[50:22] like the European Union or like the
[50:24] United States federal government I think
[50:27] if enough people wake up they'll start
[50:30] to say
[50:31] like why am I paying 39% of my income
[50:36] for what exactly you know oh and there's
[50:41] inflation what am I getting in return
[50:43] for this I have no idea right so I think
[50:46] we're heading in that direction but I
[50:48] think it's going to be very bumpy uh on
[50:50] the way there yeah and I mean in in you
[50:54] can even make an argument that inflation
[50:56] rate ta your tax rate is like 80% of or
[51:00] more even when you factor in inflation
[51:03] when you factor in there taxes also on
[51:05] the goods that you buy with your already
[51:07] taxed money and and when you infector
[51:09] all the taxes involved in in the buying
[51:11] process in the the whole economy so like
[51:14] there's a lot of freaking taxes in
[51:16] especially Austria Germany in the
[51:17] European countries so um and you also
[51:21] described uh I saw it somewhere in
[51:23] interview I don't remember which one it
[51:24] was you described Bitcoin also the enemy
[51:27] of uh the the money of enemies which are
[51:30] LOF completely uh I think you basically
[51:32] described it as like this is the money
[51:35] that even your enemies uh can have which
[51:38] also uh I thought about that when you
[51:40] said like oh Larry f is is is working
[51:44] for you because a lot of people like see
[51:46] Larry think as as this evil person as
[51:49] the the person that is on the field
[51:52] system on the field side but all of the
[51:54] sudden um even the enemies that adopt
[51:57] Bitcoin are working for you I love that
[52:00] analogy you what you you're giving how
[52:04] how powerful is that of a technology
[52:07] when all of the sudden the incentives of
[52:09] everyone uh is aligned and and and what
[52:12] do you think will will that to to this
[52:15] this corrupt systems outside even uh
[52:18] governments maybe like big tech and and
[52:21] all those systems yeah so it's a very
[52:25] difficult thing to V visualize and to
[52:28] kind of like wrap your head around
[52:31] because there's nothing to compare it to
[52:34] but now there is let me give you an
[52:36] example the
[52:38] country with the most popular president
[52:41] in the
[52:42] America of course I'm talking about El
[52:45] Salvador is the first country that made
[52:47] Bitcoin legal tender they lowered the
[52:50] crime to the point that it's safer than
[52:53] a lot of American big cities and they've
[52:56] respected private property rights and
[52:59] stavy Herbert is predicting that the GDP
[53:01] is going to
[53:02] 10x and that was the first country that
[53:05] made Bitcoin legal
[53:06] tender what
[53:08] happened I don't think it's a
[53:10] coincidence that that country the first
[53:14] country that fixed the base layer of
[53:16] society what do I mean by that the the
[53:18] computer that you're using right now the
[53:20] microphone right the glasses that you
[53:22] have on your face the shirt you probably
[53:25] purchased that with money right so it's
[53:28] a core it's a
[53:30] core function in The Human Condition
[53:34] money like the ability to transact with
[53:37] someone else without having to barter
[53:39] right I don't need to tell you this
[53:40] you're a bitcoiner that system is broken
[53:44] it's corrupt it's broken right and
[53:47] because it's broken it misalign the
[53:50] incentive structure where if you're a
[53:52] politician in Brussels or Washington DC
[53:56] see you're not incentivized to do good
[53:59] by your constituents you're incentivized
[54:03] to get as close as possible to the money
[54:05] printer because that's where you're
[54:07] going to get your money from in Els
[54:08] salador it's really interesting and it's
[54:11] a very unique situation as well they
[54:13] don't have their own currency they have
[54:16] the dollar so because they can't just
[54:19] print it out of thin air right they're
[54:22] like okay I don't want to be heavily
[54:24] relying on the dollar I'm going to be
[54:26] relying on
[54:27] bitcoin and then look at that you're
[54:30] going to you you start to have good
[54:32] outcomes what's really interesting is I
[54:34] could tell you what it's done for my
[54:36] life all of a sudden my life has
[54:38] improved I bet you you've been on a
[54:40] Bitcoin stand I don't know how many
[54:41] years but I bet your life is is
[54:43] improving by the day I've seen what it's
[54:47] done to my friends I've seen what it's
[54:48] done to my family I've seen what it's
[54:50] done to Michael sailor public company
[54:53] right every single time it's a country
[54:57] or an
[54:58] individual or an institution and they
[55:02] have adopted the Bitcoin standard you
[55:05] don't change Bitcoin Bitcoin changes you
[55:07] and all of a sudden things start working
[55:08] out and why are things working out well
[55:12] it's it's like pretty simple if you
[55:14] think about it imagine the thing that
[55:17] you're saving in is consistently losing
[55:21] value every single day of your life so
[55:24] it's like you're running on a Tre like
[55:26] you're not moving forward it's like
[55:28] you're putting all your energy and your
[55:30] time and your work into earning effing
[55:34] paper and that paper is losing less and
[55:38] less purchasing power over time now you
[55:41] switch to bitcoin and all of a sudden
[55:44] it's like you're purchas it's because of
[55:47] its absolute scarcity because you can't
[55:48] just print more of it out of thin air
[55:50] all of a sudden your purchasing power
[55:52] just increases over time so all of a
[55:55] sudden it doesn't even matter if you're
[55:57] at the bottom end of the economic
[55:59] spectrum if you save in Bitcoin over
[56:02] time you're a you're able to live a life
[56:05] of abundance right and the world has
[56:08] been living the exact opposite of that
[56:10] Jeff Booth I love the case that he's
[56:13] making which is that society and the
[56:17] world should naturally be deflationary
[56:20] because of technology and because of the
[56:23] productivity gains that come from
[56:25] technology
[56:27] but because of Fiat and government
[56:30] intervention in money they've coerced it
[56:34] into being an inflationary like
[56:37] situation and they've scoped the world
[56:40] which is the craziest effing part
[56:42] they've sced everyone into believing
[56:47] that somehow money has to lose
[56:50] purchasing power to work that is
[56:54] insane and and you talk to your family
[56:56] about this it's like what is inflation
[56:59] why are the prices going up and they're
[57:01] like oh Ukraine the corona the the virus
[57:07] the pandemic and you're just see you're
[57:08] looking at them and you're like you're
[57:11] like I don't say you're crazy but it's
[57:13] like that's insane and the reason that
[57:18] Bitcoin is so powerful is because it
[57:21] doesn't require democracy it doesn't
[57:24] require a bunch of people to agree you
[57:28] as an individual can start living on a
[57:31] sound money standard and all of a sudden
[57:34] even if the people around you just don't
[57:36] believe you you're just like all right
[57:38] don't believe me like my life is getting
[57:40] better and this is the part where the
[57:43] beauty of Bitcoin is is super
[57:47] fascinating if you're a miner you're not
[57:49] mining Bitcoin out of the goodness of
[57:51] your heart if you're a Bitcoin node
[57:54] operator you're not running that node
[57:57] because you just want to run that node
[57:59] you're doing it as a minor you're doing
[58:01] it for profit as a node operator you're
[58:04] doing it for uh you're doing it because
[58:07] you don't want to trust someone else's
[58:08] chain it's all out of self-interest if
[58:11] you're a Bitcoin evangelist or content
[58:12] creator it's like you love talking about
[58:14] Bitcoin but I bet you you hold Bitcoin
[58:16] too right so it's like you're incentives
[58:20] are aligned with mine they're aligned
[58:23] with sailor they're aligned with the
[58:25] miners they're aligned with buou they're
[58:28] aligned with the node operators they're
[58:30] aligned with Larry Fink they're Al every
[58:33] single person that is actively holding
[58:36] Bitcoin is now working for you and this
[58:40] is what I mean it's an aligned incentive
[58:43] structure system and take a look at the
[58:46] countries or the institutions the people
[58:50] or the families that have adopted it
[58:52] it's always a great story and now take a
[58:55] look at the society
[58:57] that have gone down the route of Fiat
[59:00] it's always the same story nihilism
[59:03] poverty despair inequality War always
[59:07] right and I think it boils down to like
[59:10] a very fundamental reason and I love to
[59:14] be inclusive in my messaging and I I
[59:15] don't like to go down the spiritual
[59:17] route but what I'll what I will say is
[59:21] you know in the Ten Commandments one of
[59:22] The Commandments is Thou shalt not steal
[59:26] the money is based on theft it's theft
[59:30] it's stealing you're stealing someone
[59:32] else's energy it's not taxation you can
[59:35] make we and you can have a conversation
[59:37] about taxation but to be fair the social
[59:41] contract has been established so people
[59:43] have agreed okay for whatever reason I'm
[59:45] paying 50% I I don't know how they
[59:47] convince people of doing that but it's
[59:49] been agreed upon you see it come out of
[59:51] your account you know you see you feel
[59:54] that you're paying those taxes
[59:56] the evil of Fiat and currency
[59:59] debasement is that the number in your
[60:02] bank account stays exactly the
[60:04] same but what you can purchase with it
[60:08] goes lower so it's very Sinister and
[60:12] people aren't aware of it and
[60:13] governments take advantage of it you've
[60:15] seen the videos of Christine lagard he's
[60:18] like the problem with inflation is
[60:21] employers are H hiring too much people
[60:24] are spending too much money you know uh
[60:27] we saw with Cala recently I will stop
[60:30] the companies from price
[60:32] gouging like it's insane look if we were
[60:36] in a free market and a market in a
[60:39] specific Supermarket they raised their
[60:41] prices that would create an opportunity
[60:43] for all the other markets to say oh
[60:45] they're raising the price we're going to
[60:46] lower our prices and we're going to take
[60:48] market share from them the free market
[60:50] will take care of it it's government
[60:52] intervention that has really screwed
[60:55] things up
[60:56] and that's where Bitcoin comes in to
[60:58] save the day with an aligned incentive
[61:01] structure model where everybody wins and
[61:04] everybody can save and earn and hope for
[61:07] a better future rather than this
[61:10] nihilistic death machine that is Fiat
[61:13] and Central Banking
[61:15] wow I love the rambles a lot um it's
[61:19] really cool one thing that UHA came to
[61:22] my mind also when when we talking about
[61:25] Community when we you talk about uh all
[61:27] the things that is social media doing
[61:29] it's really interesting that you um
[61:31] explain is like social media and
[61:32] internet it kind of started that fire
[61:34] and then now like Bitcoin is like
[61:36] carrying the torch even even further uh
[61:39] and it's uh exactly against all those
[61:42] things that you just said with like uh
[61:45] the with like the the salary and all
[61:47] those things um is fire against that um
[61:52] one thing that came to my mind sorry um
[61:55] is the set
[61:56] uh the taxes in in America you have to
[61:59] pay that on out of your account right as
[62:02] if if you're an employer employ employee
[62:05] you have to pay that actually to the
[62:07] government directly or does the employer
[62:10] does that for you yeah so the way that
[62:11] they did it and they they actually it
[62:13] was like kind of Insidious right so um
[62:17] if you're a W2 employee like if you're
[62:19] not a contractor they will automatically
[62:22] deduct the tax like your employer will
[62:24] deduct the taxes out of your check and
[62:28] the way that they got away with that and
[62:30] it always connects with war and Fiat
[62:32] it's always whatever so the way that
[62:34] that was instituted in the United States
[62:36] is during World War II and the excuse
[62:39] was we need the extra money to pay for
[62:43] the bad you know pay for the war against
[62:45] the bad guys right when World War II
[62:49] ended that system never went away it
[62:52] stayed right so that's essentially that
[62:55] keeps on happening like people have to
[62:59] understand that like it's not like one
[63:02] day you know we go from total freedom to
[63:06] the Googs it happens little by little
[63:09] over time so you know the establishment
[63:12] of the Federal Reserve the way that they
[63:14] sold the American public was we're gonna
[63:17] we're going to establish a central bank
[63:19] it's going to make the economy more
[63:21] stable we're not going to have any
[63:23] depressions mind you the biggest
[63:25] depressions in American history have
[63:27] happened under Central Banking 19 the 19
[63:31] uh the Great Depression 19 uh uh early
[63:34] 1930s late 1920s and the Great Recession
[63:37] of 2008 so that was [ __ ] okay number
[63:41] two the same year that the federal uh
[63:44] Reserve was established in the United
[63:46] States guess what was the same year that
[63:48] the federal income tax was established
[63:50] in the United States you know what the
[63:52] first percentage was for the income tax
[63:57] 3% for the highest earner 3% that's it
[64:00] what happened over time when FDR was
[64:03] President the top income tax was
[64:07] 90% so how do you go from 3% to 90%
[64:10] because the politicians say no no no no
[64:12] no no no no no don't worry it's only
[64:15] 3% when they get their foot in the door
[64:17] they start to take more and more and
[64:19] more and more and more that's
[64:21] essentially what's been happening but
[64:24] you have to like figure out the root
[64:27] cause the root what is the root cause
[64:29] like Robin why are we having these
[64:32] problems why is the bureaucracy in the
[64:34] European Union getting bigger why is the
[64:36] federal government getting bigger why do
[64:38] we have these endless Wars it's very
[64:41] simple the bureaucrats have a unique
[64:44] ability of creating money for free that
[64:46] the rest of us have to work for what
[64:49] bitcoiners are advocating for is a
[64:51] system where no one has the Godlike
[64:54] power of being able to create money for
[64:56] free that other human beings have to
[64:58] work for if you want to make more
[65:00] Bitcoin you have to mine it like
[65:03] everybody else and there's a cost to it
[65:06] you want to get more Bitcoin you have to
[65:08] earn it you have to buy it or you have
[65:09] to mine it there is no special person
[65:13] that has the ability to create Bitcoin
[65:16] at no cost to them that is what is wrong
[65:20] fundamentally with the government and
[65:22] fundamentally with a lot of the world's
[65:24] problems say half the world's problems
[65:26] are caused by that root issue if you fix
[65:30] that problem a lot of these divisions
[65:33] that people feel will go away because it
[65:36] it boils down to economics like you and
[65:39] I are both I would say very similar kind
[65:41] of
[65:42] generation do we have the same
[65:44] opportunities as our parents like do we
[65:48] have the ability to buy a home or buy
[65:50] the thing or whatever I don't even know
[65:52] if I didn't thank God I found Bitcoin
[65:55] because if I didn't find Bitcoin like I
[65:57] would be screwed like in five different
[66:00] ways right so why is it that if the
[66:04] world is growing in productivity the
[66:06] products are getting better life is
[66:09] getting better the technology is getting
[66:11] better why is it that we're getting
[66:13] poor it's the money the money's broken
[66:17] right so this is what Bitcoin fixes and
[66:21] the more we are able to highlight it
[66:25] using social
[66:26] media the more attention we'll get to it
[66:30] and really what we want is for people to
[66:32] ask a very basic question if we get 80%
[66:35] or 50% or 40% of society to ask these
[66:39] two questions question number one what
[66:42] is money question number
[66:45] two why does my money need to lose value
[66:48] for it to function politicians do not
[66:52] have a you will see them turn white you
[66:55] will see them say stuff like that
[66:57] question is a danger to democracy that
[67:00] question is instability you'll see them
[67:02] say anything and everything but they
[67:05] will not answer the question the reason
[67:07] they don't answer the question they
[67:09] don't have an answer to the question
[67:10] they don't have a good answer to the
[67:11] question so yeah man it's a it's a very
[67:15] interesting you know moment in history
[67:17] we're living some people call it the
[67:19] fourth turning um but our generation in
[67:23] the fourth turning Robin we are the hero
[67:26] generation we are the generation that's
[67:28] supposed to make things right the last
[67:31] time this happened in human history was
[67:33] during World War II just to kind of give
[67:36] you an idea we got a [ __ ] end of the
[67:38] stick I I gotta gotta be honest with you
[67:40] we got a bad deck of cards but it's our
[67:43] responsibility to do what we can with
[67:46] the situation that was presented to us
[67:49] and leave the world a better place in
[67:52] which we found it like we got to fix the
[67:54] [ __ ] that was put on to us so that our
[67:57] children and our children's children can
[68:00] be free but at the same time I think
[68:02] it's uh an amazing time to be alive with
[68:05] the internet Revolution with Bitcoin at
[68:07] a start I think it's a it's amazing uh
[68:10] time to be alive and to be to be young
[68:12] right now but I 100% agree like uh my uh
[68:16] Grandma had a lot of land she could just
[68:20] uh get to like she has six kids and she
[68:23] she just uh gifted each kid land to
[68:27] build a home onto like she just had the
[68:30] land and she has plenty more uh so it's
[68:33] like uh the that that level of of of
[68:36] like wealth it's so like if you compare
[68:40] it to this generation it's it's like not
[68:42] even close to it it's really interesting
[68:45] but we're coming closer to the end
[68:46] routine as we already over the one hour
[68:48] Mark um I have always two questions the
[68:51] first question is always the same for
[68:52] every guest and the second is then from
[68:54] the previous guest um the first question
[68:56] for you that is always the same question
[68:58] what can we learn from you besides all
[69:01] the things that we already talked about
[69:03] on the podcast I would say don't lose
[69:07] like I would say you know you don't need
[69:10] a college education you don't need
[69:14] credentials you don't need special
[69:16] approval don't let
[69:19] Society put you in a box in terms of
[69:22] what you can do and what you can't do
[69:25] all your dreams are 100% achievable if
[69:29] you want to build a business if you want
[69:31] to follow your heart if you want to be a
[69:33] content creator if you want to whatever
[69:36] and you want to make money out of it and
[69:38] you want to succeed it is 1 million per
[69:41] possible the only question that the
[69:44] universe will continue to ask you
[69:46] especially in the beginning where you
[69:49] will have no Market feedback telling you
[69:51] that you're doing something
[69:53] right the universe is always just going
[69:55] to ask you how much do you want it and
[69:59] if you continue to say I want it and I
[70:02] want it and you show up every single day
[70:04] and you suffer and you go through the
[70:06] mud and you crawl and you and you get
[70:09] betrayed and you get back up and you
[70:12] just keep fighting and you keep fighting
[70:14] and you keep fighting eventually you
[70:16] will succeed at whatever it is that
[70:19] you're trying to succeed that's the
[70:22] message that I wish was told to me I
[70:26] think it was by certain people I just
[70:28] didn't fully appreciate how sincere they
[70:31] were when they told me that but you know
[70:35] follow your dreams if your dreams are
[70:38] very high expect to suffer and have to
[70:41] work like nobody else around you but if
[70:45] you do that you can achieve anything
[70:48] that you put your your mind to uh that's
[70:50] what I would say especially on bitcoin
[70:53] bitcoin's a [ __ ] cheat code like
[70:55] maybe not on Fiat but on bitcoin for
[70:57] sure like it just makes everything so
[70:59] much
[71:00] easier H that that that's for sure um
[71:04] really cool uh now coming to the end
[71:06] routine where the previous guest is
[71:07] asking a question for the next guest
[71:09] without knowing who the next guest
[71:10] actually is um and your question from
[71:12] the previous guest uh is an interesting
[71:14] one what is the last thing you learned
[71:16] about Bitcoin and why did it stuck in
[71:18] your head wow so the Bitcoin rabbit hole
[71:21] is extremely it's never ending and I
[71:25] always have
[71:27] these uh these uh these
[71:31] realizations um like the deeper and
[71:33] deeper and deeper you go down and one of
[71:36] the realizations I have lately we we
[71:38] just spent a good amount of time I
[71:40] actually tweeted it out yesterday and
[71:43] it's basically like look
[71:46] um uh the money of Communism is Central
[71:50] Bank digital currencies the money of
[71:53] Bitcoin the money of capitalism is is
[71:55] Bitcoin um if you see it from that world
[72:00] viiew everything around you makes sense
[72:03] like in terms of what certain political
[72:05] parties are doing in turn certain what's
[72:07] happening in your
[72:09] country if you see it from that
[72:11] perspective so that's where I'm at in
[72:13] the rabbit hole perhaps it's because of
[72:15] the election perhaps it's because of the
[72:18] fact that they lock the samurai wallet
[72:20] guys in jail per perhaps it's because
[72:22] they've been attacking self- custody
[72:24] perhaps it's because they've been
[72:25] attacking the mining industry I mean
[72:27] even in Europe and Norway like so much
[72:31] energy up north and they're like let's
[72:33] ban Bitcoin mining you're just like what
[72:35] the f look at it from that lens
[72:38] capitalism you want capitalism in your
[72:40] future you want a free you want a free
[72:43] market Society Bitcoin is the only
[72:45] currency that will facilitate that if
[72:48] you want a totalitarian collectivist
[72:51] communist fascist Society cbdc is the
[72:55] only money that's going to enable that
[72:57] type of society that's one of the latest
[73:00] things I've learned down going down the
[73:02] Bitcoin rabbit hole and I'm glad I got
[73:04] to talk about it today with you 100%
[73:07] agreed um I appreciate you coming on I
