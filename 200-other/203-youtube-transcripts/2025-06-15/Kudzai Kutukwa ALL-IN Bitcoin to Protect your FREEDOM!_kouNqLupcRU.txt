[00:00] it's very easy to penalize you now
[00:02] financially or otherwise to be stopped
[00:04] from expressing certain views privacy is
[00:06] more like a a privilege and not a human
[00:09] right anymore the coin gave us that
[00:11] opportunity to own our own money I
[00:13] actually see lightning opening up a
[00:16] whole different plora of opportunities
[00:18] the lightning Network opens up numerous
[00:20] opportunities particularly to service
[00:22] the unbank where people are earning in
[00:24] Bitcoin and spending in Bitcoin
[00:26] immediately removes the need first of
[00:28] all to go to an exchange to buy and it
[00:30] removes the need as well to change it
[00:33] back into Fiat because you're spending
[00:35] it in sets you will have full scale
[00:37] Financial inclusion and that fulls scale
[00:40] Financial inclusion will help deal with
[00:41] a lot of the transactional issues that
[00:43] you face on a day-to-day basis you want
[00:46] a peer-to-peer electronic form of money
[00:49] that preserves privacy and that that
[00:52] doesn't require a third party to
[00:54] [Music]
[00:57] transect it's really interesting when we
[00:59] talk about uh Bitcoin there's always
[01:02] this topic and maybe that's an good
[01:04] Avenue to to start today with with
[01:07] privacy because I saw you you made some
[01:10] some topics and some articles around
[01:12] that also um do you feel like that
[01:15] privacy uh could be preserved uh with
[01:19] Bitcoin it seems like bit the Privacy
[01:21] topic is more like a a privilege and not
[01:24] a human right anymore it's like we kind
[01:27] of have to fight for our privacy um do
[01:29] you think that or how do you think that
[01:31] Bitcoin could help us to preserve our
[01:34] privacy that's a very very big
[01:37] question and I'll answer it in sections
[01:43] so first and foremost like you rightly
[01:45] pointed out privacy is definitely being
[01:48] massively attacked um currently in
[01:51] various ways whether it's online in
[01:55] terms of how much information that um
[01:59] gets leaked from your devices when
[02:01] you're browsing on whether it's on
[02:04] social media or just you know your
[02:06] normal day-to-day browsing how much of
[02:09] your personal identifiable information
[02:12] do you need to get online so in some
[02:15] countries when you buy a phone for
[02:18] example you need to actually register
[02:21] your ID proof of residence so there will
[02:24] always be like um something to trace
[02:28] back your browsing activity or your
[02:30] online activity to your real
[02:33] identity um and when you extrapolate
[02:37] that let's say into the land of digital
[02:40] digital payments um when you think of
[02:42] platforms like PayPal and platforms of
[02:46] that nature or even your normal
[02:47] day-to-day bank account again you still
[02:51] come back to the whole same thing where
[02:53] you are kic before you get access to
[02:57] those services and the certain
[02:58] information that you have to surrender
[03:01] to quote unquote prove that you are who
[03:03] you say you are but at the same time
[03:06] what that does is it gives all of this
[03:08] information into the hands of these um
[03:12] institutions and they're then able to
[03:15] sort of develop a
[03:17] digital um You can call it a digital map
[03:20] or digital footprint of whether of your
[03:23] transactions your digital transactions
[03:25] or even your browsing activity so if we
[03:29] take if we put Bitcoin aside and if we
[03:31] just stick to the way things are
[03:34] currently you can see that with a lot of
[03:38] the Technologies or let me say platforms
[03:41] they're not privacy preserving first so
[03:44] they focus on other factors that require
[03:48] some sort of um exchange or some sort
[03:52] of um what can I call it uh verification
[03:55] of your identity whether through a phone
[03:58] number through an ID through some sort
[04:00] of picture something to prove that you
[04:02] are who you say you
[04:04] are and as we get to a point in the
[04:07] world where you have let's say things
[04:11] that you might disagree with or things
[04:13] that you might feel are not
[04:16] necessarily in line with your values
[04:20] it's very easy to penalize you now
[04:22] financially or otherwise to get you to
[04:25] ex stop from stop to be stopped from
[04:27] expressing certain views as well as as
[04:30] to kind of whip you into line so to
[04:34] speak
[04:36] so if we did not have something like
[04:40] Bitcoin right whilst we know that
[04:42] Bitcoin in and of itself is not private
[04:46] by default or by Design but at the same
[04:50] time it gives us a platform from which
[04:53] to build new Financial systems new ways
[04:56] of trading and transacting new
[04:58] applications that are not necessarily
[05:01] kyc first and things that would allow us
[05:04] to trade communicate transact and so on
[05:08] and so forth in ways that are mutually
[05:12] beneficial but that can allow us to
[05:14] protect our identity so that's kind of
[05:18] how I believe that Bitcoin could serve
[05:22] as something that could be used to
[05:26] protect our privacy or at least to
[05:28] preserve it in some way
[05:30] yeah it's also interesting so for me
[05:33] when we talk about identity and privacy
[05:37] um it seems like all those institutions
[05:41] uh own our data which is uh so
[05:45] normalized that like Facebook owns our
[05:48] data the doctor owns our Medical Data
[05:52] the the they don't they have access to
[05:54] it and you have to ask them to get your
[05:56] own Medical Data from them uh so it's
[06:00] it's kind of weird weird situation that
[06:03] we in and I would love to for us to have
[06:06] the data for us to own the data and we
[06:09] can give access to the data if necessary
[06:12] for example like in maybe it makes sense
[06:15] for certain types of goods to only be
[06:17] able to buy it from a certain age for
[06:19] example alcohol in a
[06:21] supermarket uh you could just like uh
[06:24] prove like oh yeah I'm 18 plus or
[06:26] something like that and they don't get
[06:27] like the birth date from that but just
[06:29] like get a verification that you're
[06:31] actually over 18 so I think a lot has to
[06:34] happen in in I don't know how to call it
[06:37] identity management and and things like
[06:40] that and also like with with Bitcoin uh
[06:43] with payments uh it would be amazing to
[06:45] have privacy in Layer Two which is where
[06:49] you own your uh Bitcoin where you own
[06:51] your money and then also you can decide
[06:54] who can see your data and who's can not
[06:56] so like I feel like that's a a big big
[06:59] part of the future and without that um I
[07:03] feel like we we don't even have free
[07:06] speech without that like if we don't
[07:07] have
[07:08] that I couldn't agree more um and I
[07:13] would kind of also take that a step
[07:16] further to say that they definitely
[07:20] there's definitely need for more
[07:23] Innovation and more platforms to be
[07:24] built that are one privacy preserving
[07:28] but two that would allow you to prove
[07:31] that you are who you say you are or at
[07:33] least in a way to own your own data kind
[07:36] of like what Noster does where it gives
[07:38] you that opportunity where by having
[07:42] your public key and private key attached
[07:45] to a particular npub you are able then
[07:49] to verify or to use that as you know
[07:53] kind of a decentralized identity of
[07:55] sorts and at the same time even if you
[07:59] are posting stuff that um a particular
[08:02] Gnostic client might not be let's say on
[08:05] board with you still get to retain
[08:08] control of your data and control of your
[08:10] information so that is definitely
[08:13] something that I believe the next
[08:17] um you could say the next wave of the
[08:20] internet which includes Bitcoin and
[08:23] everything else around it definitely
[08:25] requires because without that especially
[08:28] now that um you can see how things are
[08:32] shaping up politically globally where
[08:35] the world seems to be getting more and
[08:37] more polarized along different topics
[08:40] and depending on which side is in power
[08:43] um the other side it becomes very easy
[08:46] for you to be marginalized and targeted
[08:48] and paralized and all these other
[08:50] different things that can actually
[08:52] happen further to that I also believe
[08:54] that in order to maximize your own
[08:57] individual sovereignty things need to
[08:59] get to a point where Bitcoin gave us
[09:02] that opportunity to own our own money
[09:06] and unfortunately I would say to a
[09:09] degree some of
[09:13] the if you think of say Bitcoin
[09:15] exchanges as an
[09:17] example they came in to kind of provide
[09:20] a market where people could buy and sell
[09:22] Bitcoin but at the same time they then
[09:25] made it easy for stuff like kyc to then
[09:29] become you know to be put right in the
[09:31] center of it so it gradually became a
[09:35] choke point for eroding that privacy
[09:38] when it was designed to be a
[09:39] pseudonymous type currency where even
[09:42] though in its design it wasn't like
[09:44] privacy first like some of the other
[09:48] quote unquote privacy coins that are out
[09:50] there but at the same time with
[09:53] sumity there wasn't supposed to be some
[09:56] at least the way I understood it or at
[09:58] least from the way I look at it there
[10:01] never needed to be any point through
[10:03] which when you were let's say signing up
[10:05] for a wallet or transacting since it's a
[10:07] peer-to-peer Network where you needed to
[10:10] have anything that was attached to your
[10:13] identity so when then this changed
[10:18] particularly with the coming in of
[10:20] exchanges and other services that in
[10:23] order to function let's say in a more
[10:24] Fiat World required that those kyc
[10:27] processes to happen I think that became
[10:30] perhaps what you could
[10:32] say um an area of concern through which
[10:36] certain attacks could then
[10:38] be
[10:40] um could then be levied on um let's say
[10:44] people within the Bitcoin space should
[10:46] the need be so from that perspective I
[10:49] would actually argue or at least put
[10:52] across
[10:53] the um thought process to say these are
[10:58] some of the things that we sort of as we
[11:01] build and even as new products come
[11:03] online we need to also kind of think
[11:05] about that how do we build privacy
[11:08] preserving Technologies whether it's
[11:10] layer one layer two how do we ensure
[11:12] that people can still access and use
[11:15] Bitcoin whether it's buying or selling
[11:17] it where you don't have any sort of you
[11:21] know kic
[11:23] required and even when you look at a
[11:25] platform like Noster it's great in the
[11:27] sense that it allows you to send zaps or
[11:33] at least for people to interact and even
[11:36] though at this point it's still you know
[11:38] tiny amounts of Bitcoin that are being
[11:40] exchanged depending with the process or
[11:42] depending with the reality but I believe
[11:45] that it can get to a point where it
[11:47] evolves into proper marketplace where
[11:51] certain trade bigger things can be
[11:53] traded or bigger programs or
[11:56] applications can be built on top of it
[11:58] or leverage it
[11:59] the protocol itself to then allow kyc
[12:03] free services that are also privacy
[12:05] preserving to be built and I think that
[12:09] that would be actually the most ideal
[12:11] way because currently I don't see any
[12:14] feasible way in which you
[12:17] can
[12:19] have some sort of interaction with the
[12:22] present Fiat systems or with present Web
[12:25] 2.0 Technologies which where where you
[12:29] can then interact with them privacy free
[12:33] through and through or like in a very
[12:35] private manner through and through
[12:36] they've made it extremely difficult not
[12:38] to say it's impossible but it has become
[12:41] extremely difficult to navigate your way
[12:43] through a lot of those platforms and
[12:46] applications where you don't need to dox
[12:48] yourself in some way and I like the
[12:50] example that you gave about let's say
[12:53] you need to go buy something or to
[12:55] verify let's say your age or that sort
[12:58] of
[12:59] Stu but without necessarily doxing your
[13:02] entire identity where it's provable that
[13:06] yes this is um an individual who is
[13:09] above 18 years of age if that's a
[13:11] requirement let's say at a liquor store
[13:14] or anything of that sort but not
[13:17] necessarily without exposing your
[13:21] identity or any other sensitive
[13:24] information um which can be in this age
[13:27] of hackers stolen learn and then you
[13:30] know exploit it in many different ways
[13:33] and identity theft is also a real risk
[13:36] which I guess a lot of us might not
[13:39] think about but there are real markets
[13:42] where you know all of these things are
[13:44] exchanged and it leaves you vulnerable
[13:47] particularly if you have bank accounts
[13:50] that have large sums of money within
[13:52] them or things that um are very private
[13:55] that you would want to stay private so I
[13:59] look at privacy and identity kind of as
[14:03] one thing in the same bucket where it's
[14:06] very difficult to separate the two where
[14:10] you would have complete privacy or the
[14:13] maximum amount of privacy that you can
[14:15] have without control over your identity
[14:19] or vice versa yeah absolutely I that's
[14:23] that's really I think there are a lot of
[14:25] good insights in there and uh it's also
[14:28] interesting for me how we may be able to
[14:31] build those Technologies on top of
[14:33] Bitcoin and connect it all with that
[14:35] protocol of money um do you see
[14:38] lightning the lightning Network as the
[14:40] the main solution there or are you also
[14:42] looking at like different uh fedin at
[14:44] arcs uh the AR protocol and other things
[14:47] uh what are you most excited about the
[14:49] the layer two solutions I like that
[14:53] question yes lightning I think it's
[14:55] definitely one of those um Solutions
[14:59] because it allows a lot of things to
[15:01] happen first and foremost it allowed us
[15:04] to reduce the cost of you know
[15:07] day-to-day transacting like going to the
[15:09] grocery store buying a cup of coffee and
[15:12] you know those normal day-to-day
[15:14] activities that you would do and it then
[15:16] opens up the market to build additional
[15:21] services that would
[15:23] allow say for example something let me
[15:28] use an example example like um Air
[15:31] Airline miles right where normally in
[15:35] the Fiat world you know if I have this
[15:37] kind of debit card or if I'm with this
[15:39] bank I can access depending with the
[15:42] type of bank account that you have if I
[15:44] go to the airport I can have access to
[15:46] that airport lounge I can have access to
[15:51] I can Bank my frequent flyer miles this
[15:53] way or I can earn points if I use this
[15:56] particular airline that is partnered
[15:58] with um my bank and so on and so forth
[16:01] so you've got these reward programs that
[16:04] you can
[16:05] actually utilize in real life that can
[16:08] then eventually save you money or give
[16:11] you certain benefits that you may not
[16:13] have access to at a particular point in
[16:16] time so what the lightning Network
[16:18] enabled is for those kind of things
[16:20] reward programs whether on airline miles
[16:23] or other shopping points or other reward
[16:26] programs to be built it also allows for
[16:29] other markets and other economies as
[16:31] well to come into play um like one of
[16:34] the things I've been really looking into
[16:38] also because of my kind of professional
[16:41] experience and background in crop
[16:43] insurance and how you can have you know
[16:46] something like the lightning Network or
[16:48] how the lightning Network then enables
[16:51] different Financial applications to be
[16:53] built let's say within banking within
[16:55] Insurance the normal day-to-day things
[16:58] that people would want that they would
[17:00] not necessarily be able to get so I
[17:03] actually see lightning opening up a
[17:06] whole different um plethora of
[17:08] opportunities out there and even when
[17:10] you think of something like um the
[17:13] current flavor of the moment AI where
[17:17] you've got different um whether's
[17:19] different llms coming into play or
[17:22] different kind of AI applications being
[17:24] built or if you want to be to extend
[17:28] your mind all the way into the
[17:30] future um where you can think of things
[17:32] like machine to machine payments where
[17:35] different AI programs are paying each
[17:37] other via apis and all of that other
[17:40] stuff these are the things that I
[17:43] believe that the lightning Network would
[17:47] definitely become the best killer
[17:50] application for within uh particularly
[17:53] where AI is concerned where a lot of the
[17:55] services are going to necessarily
[17:57] require let's say microtransactions that
[18:00] can happen whether it's an API call or a
[18:03] request for certain services or for
[18:05] machines to pay for particular services
[18:08] that they would use I can't see any
[18:12] other solution working of course I'm not
[18:16] necessarily a technical person myself so
[18:19] that's there's that to bear in mind but
[18:22] based on the research and The Limited
[18:24] information at least that I've come
[18:25] across so far I don't see Fiat payments
[18:28] is doing a great job in that space
[18:30] because of all the kind of expenses that
[18:33] are associated with it and I don't see
[18:38] any other quote unquote coin or chain
[18:41] being in a position to handle that so I
[18:45] actually believe that um the lightning
[18:47] Network even for some of those
[18:49] applications that are yet to be built
[18:52] around in that space whether we're
[18:53] talking AI or even now where we I I
[18:57] mentioned reward programs those do exist
[18:59] now in the Bitcoin space but they're
[19:01] kind of in their infancy but we will see
[19:04] a lot of those things grow and as you
[19:07] start to have a lot of those things
[19:09] being built on top of the lightning
[19:11] Network and um incorporating or
[19:14] integrating Bitcoin in some way shape or
[19:16] form I think that um lightning becomes a
[19:21] very very important technology and a
[19:23] very very important um layer too
[19:27] that I would say the sky is the limit I
[19:31] love that the sky is definitely the
[19:33] limit or maybe not even the sky maybe
[19:36] the sky isn't even the limit or maybe
[19:38] the sky is where it all
[19:43] begins
[19:44] absolutely that that might be true that
[19:46] might be true yeah it's also uh
[19:48] interesting for me um what layer 2 and
[19:51] the lightning Network can do especially
[19:53] with Bitcoin uh for the unbanked me as
[19:56] an Austrian
[19:58] and my colleagues in Austria don't
[20:01] understand that because in Austria we
[20:03] have a bank trade of like 99.5% or
[20:06] something like that everyone has a bank
[20:07] account so that's why people here uh
[20:10] when they think about the use case of
[20:12] Bitcoin they're like yeah it's a store
[20:14] of value it's something where my
[20:16] financial energy goes up over time um
[20:19] but when we look at other countries
[20:21] where the banking rate is 70% 50% or
[20:24] even lower than 50 maybe 30% 20%
[20:27] whatever uh depends on where in the
[20:29] world you are I think the lightning
[20:32] Network right now is already an amazing
[20:35] bank account uh and it's it's uh it's
[20:37] cost free and it's it's it's amazing um
[20:40] uh you you're in Africa right uh so how
[20:44] do you think is is that going right now
[20:46] what do you see in in that impact uh one
[20:50] of the layer two for for the financial
[20:52] inclusion that I probably don't see a
[20:55] lot but it's all interesting for me how
[20:57] how this is going in in
[20:59] Africa interesting interesting so yeah
[21:04] um definitely the lightning
[21:06] Network opens up um new new numerous
[21:10] opportunities particularly to service
[21:12] the unbanked
[21:14] and I don't know I'm not I can't think
[21:18] of a an alternative term but I've never
[21:21] really liked the term unbanked because
[21:24] it introduces the idea that you need a
[21:28] bank to sort of transact and to have
[21:31] like a financial life where when you
[21:34] think about the whole purpose of Bitcoin
[21:36] it was really instituted to remove third
[21:39] parties or middlemen like Banks but for
[21:42] the lack of a better term because I'm
[21:45] yet to invent one or someone else is yet
[21:47] to come up with with a more interesting
[21:50] term um I would say that it does give
[21:55] people a way to actually transact
[21:58] because there are parts of Africa where
[22:02] you have people that have um have a hard
[22:05] time accessing things like a government
[22:07] ID or accessing something you know some
[22:10] sort of
[22:11] identification which becomes necessary
[22:14] to open a bank account so that's one
[22:17] problem you also have people that are
[22:19] not formally employed so they don't have
[22:22] let's say a letter a contract of
[22:24] employment or a pay slip through which
[22:27] when they're going to open a bank
[22:28] account account you would need it's part
[22:30] of what you would need to produce either
[22:33] um to prove that you have some sort of
[22:35] income um that can then sustain a
[22:37] particular bank account so when you have
[22:40] to especially in problems where it's
[22:42] very kind of the extreme side where you
[22:46] have those two problems coinciding where
[22:50] someone can't access not because they
[22:52] don't know how to access or they don't
[22:54] have the ability to but it's just so
[22:57] cumbersome and some countries to just
[22:59] get something as simple as a a governmen
[23:03] issued ID it takes a long time it's not
[23:06] the story for the whole African
[23:07] continent obviously but there are
[23:10] countries like that where you do have
[23:12] that problem particularly in regions
[23:15] perhaps where the they are like War torn
[23:18] regions or where you have people that
[23:21] are escaping conflict that are refugees
[23:25] the whole identity thing might actually
[23:27] be a problem for them especially in
[23:30] their host country where they'll now
[23:31] need some sort of um mechanisms and
[23:34] means to transact of course we also know
[23:37] that there are some sort of solutions
[23:39] and workarounds that have been built at
[23:41] least in this area where we discuss
[23:43] refugees but obviously they're not
[23:46] perfect so when you think about all
[23:48] these different use cases and in some
[23:52] instances it has nothing to do with
[23:54] people's inability to access say IDs of
[23:59] sorts where they do have the IDS but
[24:02] they're just in a place
[24:04] where the banking system is just so
[24:08] expensive that it makes sense to operate
[24:11] on a cash basis for them given their
[24:14] levels of income they wouldn't it
[24:17] wouldn't be prudent for them to go and
[24:19] open a bank account where you have a
[24:21] certain amount of um um fees being
[24:25] levied or charged on your account every
[24:27] other month and perhaps that's probably
[24:31] if you're living on let's say a couple
[24:33] of bucks per day those fees could mean
[24:36] the difference between having a meal
[24:37] today and not eating anything at all so
[24:41] in those types of scenarios and in those
[24:43] types of setups and for some it's really
[24:46] a question of maybe education they just
[24:50] um prefer to still operate on a cash
[24:54] basis they don't have functional
[24:56] institutions they live in
[24:58] where the banks are so far away and with
[25:03] limited connectivity to the internet and
[25:06] even some of them without access to say
[25:09] smartphones where you can do online
[25:12] banking and all of these things so these
[25:14] are just a myriad of problems just to
[25:16] sort of um broaden up the scale and to
[25:20] broaden up the understanding
[25:21] particularly for people that may not be
[25:23] familiar with some of the issues on the
[25:25] ground to sort of understand from which
[25:28] side you end up with having different
[25:30] people being unbanked that on one side
[25:33] it could be a case of inability to
[25:36] access government issued IDs on another
[25:39] side it could be well the banks are too
[25:41] far away so you would need maybe a bus
[25:46] or uh to travel to the nearest um
[25:49] Shopping Center or some sort of banking
[25:54] institution and even that being the fact
[25:58] that with a lot of these people they're
[26:00] probably living below the poverty line
[26:02] that becomes
[26:03] unsustainable and for some it's just a
[26:05] simple mistrust of financial
[26:08] institutions and the whole banking
[26:10] system so they prefer to do it's merely
[26:12] a choice they prefer to do everything
[26:14] cash regardless of which of which bucket
[26:18] one would fall in on the continent I
[26:20] believe that um something like lightning
[26:24] or at least Bitcoin coupled with the
[26:26] lightning Network would actually give a
[26:29] lot of these people a mechanism and a
[26:31] means to then start to transact and
[26:34] trade within the 21st century economy
[26:38] and um even get to a point where some of
[26:43] them particularly those that are say
[26:45] somewhat artistic they can put some of
[26:48] their wees online sell them online and
[26:51] have a way to get paid because without a
[26:53] bank account these people are shut off
[26:56] totally from the entire online economy
[26:58] in as much as that could be something
[27:00] that could be of benefit to them that
[27:02] they could utilize to lift themselves
[27:04] out of poverty to provide a better life
[27:06] for their uh families and even to access
[27:10] certain key essential Services where
[27:12] they need it obviously like say medical
[27:15] insurance medical Aid or different types
[27:19] of financial products let's say if they
[27:22] want to start a business if they need
[27:24] some sort of credit
[27:26] extension having access to you know
[27:29] something or an asset that would then
[27:32] have a whole different Financial system
[27:34] built on top of it through which they
[27:36] can have loans insurance and life
[27:39] insurance funeral C you name it
[27:43] that would be quite helpful for a lot of
[27:48] them
[27:49] to actually deal with the problems that
[27:52] they face with on a day-to-day basis in
[27:54] so far as income generation is concerned
[27:57] and in so far as transacting within the
[28:00] 21st century economy is concerned
[28:02] because we do know that whilst cash has
[28:05] the benefit of being private I mean we
[28:07] started on a privacy
[28:09] note it's very difficult to move cash
[28:12] over long distances particularly in the
[28:16] as the world gets more and more digital
[28:19] it strengths your ability to trade and
[28:21] transact within your local community and
[28:25] around the people that you can access
[28:27] physically so in order to transcend
[28:29] those natural and physical barriers you
[28:32] would need a digital form of transacting
[28:35] and definitely this is the gap and this
[28:37] is the role that something like Bitcoin
[28:39] and um via the lightning Network as well
[28:42] and different applications that will be
[28:43] built on top of it can then come into
[28:46] then fulfill so in Africa I would
[28:48] actually
[28:49] say it's a there is massive massive
[28:54] potential for the adoption of Bitcoin
[28:57] even though we are yet to really see it
[28:59] at this point for various reasons which
[29:01] we can get into but um the potential is
[29:06] there and especially when you also then
[29:08] consider the fact that a lot of the
[29:10] currencies like the FI currencies in
[29:13] Africa
[29:14] are for the lack of a better word they
[29:18] don't retain much value over a long
[29:20] period of time so it's very difficult
[29:23] for people to say it's very they're very
[29:26] inflationary and
[29:29] um you also have a lot of
[29:33] the nonfunctional currencies coupled
[29:36] with high fees of transacting from the
[29:39] banking sector for those that do have
[29:41] access to bank accounts coupled with all
[29:43] of these other issues that I've raised
[29:45] so that presents I would say one of the
[29:48] best use cases that Bitcoin actually
[29:51] has in any at least from a more if we go
[29:56] back to the fundamentals of a p
[29:58] electronic cash
[30:00] systems I believe that that Green Field
[30:05] from which you can start to implement
[30:07] certain applications or to see certain
[30:09] use cases coming online we have a lot of
[30:12] them actually on the African
[30:15] continent Beyond using it as a store
[30:18] value just the medium of
[30:21] exchange function that Bitcoin could
[30:25] provide in and of itself be before we
[30:28] get to store value or trying to preserve
[30:31] um your purchasing power just the fact
[30:34] of having something that is of a higher
[30:38] value not necessarily shuffling people
[30:41] into Dollars which is
[30:43] basically what ends up happening when
[30:45] you have a failing fiat currency the
[30:49] next best thing that a lot of people do
[30:51] is they start saving in dollars which of
[30:55] course amongst the fat currencies that's
[30:57] usually the best option but it still
[30:59] brings you back to the same place where
[31:02] you are still having your purchasing
[31:05] power stolen albe it's much slower than
[31:08] you would with certain currencies but
[31:09] stolen
[31:10] nonetheless and you're still living
[31:13] within this control grid where you have
[31:17] a better form of currency but you're
[31:19] still within the Matrix of um the Fiat
[31:23] monetary system if you watch or listen
[31:26] to my podcast on a regular basis is I
[31:28] guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[31:30] and now the most important step is to
[31:33] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[31:36] hardware wallet my personal
[31:38] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[31:40] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[31:42] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[31:44] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[31:47] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[31:51] with the code Robin at the checkout
[31:53] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[31:57] your bitbox and the next step is to
[32:00] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:02] individual you have to have the most
[32:04] secure self custody setup you have to
[32:07] secure your own devices you have to
[32:10] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:13] an inherent plan and depending on where
[32:15] you live you even want to have a plan B
[32:18] a citizenship where you can move in case
[32:21] something goes really really wrong and
[32:23] through all those steps the Bitcoin way
[32:25] is guiding you through step by step and
[32:28] if you visit the Bitcoin way.com SLP
[32:31] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[32:34] minute free call to find out how you can
[32:37] level up your sovereignty and last but
[32:40] not least I have something completely
[32:42] new for you guys I partnered up with
[32:45] coin vigilante this is the most
[32:48] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:51] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:54] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:56] made and per perfect Bitcoin watch
[32:59] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[33:02] go out there and show that you are a
[33:04] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[33:07] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[33:10] dropped a completely new and amazing
[33:13] Genesis edition of their watch
[33:16] collections you have the date of the
[33:18] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[33:21] and of course also the block height and
[33:24] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[33:27] level of detail they put in in this
[33:30] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[33:32] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[33:36] down in the descriptions I love those
[33:38] watches so so much it's it's something
[33:42] that um I don't know if it concerns me
[33:46] but I see it a lot in countries where
[33:48] they have a high inflation like
[33:50] Argentina for example turkey for example
[33:53] Africa for example um they don't go to
[33:58] bitcoin they first go to the US dollar
[34:02] and I mean there are like I don't know
[34:04] like 60 or 70 countries that actually
[34:07] have a a Bitcoin um a US dollar standard
[34:12] outside of the US so like Salvador was
[34:15] one of the countries now they trying to
[34:16] switch to bitcoin but there are a lot of
[34:19] countries that are not in the US but
[34:21] they use only the US dollar because
[34:23] their own currency failed they don't
[34:26] have any other currency and then they
[34:28] completely be dependent on the United
[34:30] States and I'm just waiting for that
[34:33] moment where those countries are finally
[34:36] waking up like hey um we actually don't
[34:39] want to be dependent on the United
[34:40] States like how can we be independent
[34:43] from them and then they're like okay
[34:46] maybe that Bitcoin thing is actually
[34:47] something that we have to do I mean
[34:49] Budan El Salvador and some other
[34:51] countries are already moving in that
[34:53] direction but it's not a lot um but it
[34:56] will definitely come you also mentioned
[34:59] that uh the challenges of the adoption
[35:02] of of Africa and why this is that might
[35:04] be an interesting topic where like um
[35:07] they also more going towards the US
[35:09] Dollars and and most have like this fear
[35:11] of like going directly to bitcoin um
[35:15] what what do you think are the the
[35:16] biggest challenges towards that what are
[35:17] the big challenges for people not
[35:20] adopting uh Bitcoin especially now in
[35:23] Africa one of the issues that I would
[35:26] say is probably the biggest challenges
[35:29] particularly where that is concerned has
[35:31] to do with the fact that first of all
[35:35] you have a lot of scams that have come
[35:38] around using the word Bitcoin to the
[35:41] point that now when people hear the word
[35:43] Bitcoin they immediately associate it
[35:46] with some of those pyramid scams or
[35:49] Ponzi schemes that maybe brother-in-law
[35:52] has lost a shirt over or some sort of
[35:55] things like that so there is that
[35:57] initial hesitancy to move to that
[36:01] because most people's Association or at
[36:04] least thought process when it comes to
[36:05] bitcoin is that it's a scam right and of
[36:08] course this is as a result of
[36:10] insufficient education and um the
[36:13] inability to differentiate between
[36:16] what's real and what's not right because
[36:18] obviously with some scams they will talk
[36:21] about oh if you you know invest x amount
[36:24] of dollars you will get your payouts and
[36:27] Bitcoin and so on and so forth and then
[36:29] it turns out to be a rug pool but
[36:31] because the word Bitcoin was exploited
[36:34] and used as the scam was marketed it
[36:38] then throws the baby out with the bath
[36:41] water so that's problem number one that
[36:43] exists that a lot of people associate
[36:47] Bitcoin with different scams that have
[36:50] been run in the past or even that are
[36:52] currently being run by different actors
[36:56] that still try to exploit or include
[37:02] Bitcoin in some way shape or form in
[37:04] their scam so that's problem number one
[37:07] problem number two that I'll say exists
[37:10] would be the fact that there's also this
[37:13] issue of merchant adoption right
[37:16] where you don't have as many
[37:20] Merchants
[37:22] that accept it as a form of payment so
[37:29] given the fact that the the price is
[37:33] always bouncing up and down what we
[37:36] would call
[37:37] volatility even though I would argue in
[37:40] a different direction against that but
[37:42] for the purposes of the at least where
[37:44] we are now in this discussion I would
[37:47] say that given that Bitcoin is seen or
[37:51] de to be volatile if you don't have a
[37:54] mechanism through which you're going to
[37:56] spend it or a merchant that's going to
[37:58] sell you goods or services for Bitcoin
[38:01] it means therefore that if you are to
[38:04] receive Bitcoin you have to exchange it
[38:06] into some FIA currency and if the price
[38:09] dips let's say from 65 to
[38:13] 58 there goes whatever goods and
[38:16] services you are going to buy by the
[38:18] time you change it from whatever how
[38:20] many sets you have received the set
[38:23] numbers we know Remains the Same if it's
[38:25] 50,000 sets 50,000 set
[38:28] but if those 50,000 sets let's say for
[38:30] argument sake if they were worth $100
[38:32] and now they're worth 50 in the Fiat
[38:35] World it means that they're buying you
[38:37] less goods and services than they were
[38:40] maybe a couple of days ago or a couple
[38:41] of hours ago depending on how recently
[38:45] that price dip would have happened so
[38:47] part of the hesitancy to move straight
[38:49] to bitcoin has to do with that that you
[38:51] don't have a lot of platforms or
[38:54] Merchants that would be willing to
[38:55] accept Goods in exch change for SATs if
[38:59] you had that I believe perhaps some
[39:01] people would be willing
[39:03] to at least look into the idea much
[39:06] deeper and much further if they could go
[39:09] to their local grocery store and
[39:12] immediately buy Goods with Bitcoin in
[39:14] South Africa the situation is a little
[39:16] bit different because there are
[39:19] platforms that you can use to actually
[39:21] where I can go to a local supermarket
[39:24] buy things from my wallet and obviously
[39:30] the merchant will get the money in Fiat
[39:33] but I would have used Bitcoin to pay for
[39:35] services so the merchant doesn't even
[39:37] know that I'm paying him with Bitcoin
[39:40] but at the same time I I still get
[39:42] access to goods and services so in South
[39:44] Africa amongst different uh the story is
[39:47] a little bit different where you do have
[39:50] such platforms and such applications
[39:52] that allow you to pay for most goods and
[39:56] services um
[39:57] using Bitcoin so Merchant adoption is
[40:00] one the third that I would also
[40:02] highlight would have to do with say
[40:05] smartphone access where in certain parts
[40:08] of the continent smartphone penetration
[40:11] isn't as ubiquitous as in other parts of
[40:14] the continent so you do have people
[40:16] still utilizing feature phones that may
[40:20] not be able to download let's say a
[40:22] Bitcoin wallet
[40:24] so in places like that and in regions
[40:27] like that and added to that you also
[40:32] have smartphones and connectivity so if
[40:34] you have a person in a region where the
[40:36] connectivity isn't as good and they're
[40:38] using a feature phone you've got two
[40:40] problems to actually immediately deal
[40:42] with one of which is a larger scale one
[40:45] because it has to do with internet and
[40:48] cell connectivity in the area which if
[40:51] you're say a Bitcoin company maybe
[40:54] that's not
[40:55] primarily uh your
[40:58] immediate problem that you're looking to
[41:00] solve at that point in time but at the
[41:03] same time we do have say applications
[41:06] like
[41:07] machura where it allows you to have a
[41:11] Bitcoin wallet using a ussd code whether
[41:14] you're using a feature phone and or not
[41:17] or a smartphone you can still have like
[41:19] a Bitcoin wallet that you can use so
[41:21] there are solutions coming on board at
[41:23] least in that direction but at present
[41:25] machura is still rolling out in
[41:28] different African countries it's not yet
[41:31] available in all the parts of the
[41:33] continent but again it's an ongoing
[41:35] project it's improving and it's such
[41:38] applications and innovations that we
[41:40] need more of that perhaps could then
[41:43] increase the levels of Bitcoin adoption
[41:46] coupled with more like Merchant related
[41:49] adoption where you have Merchants that
[41:51] are willing to sell products and
[41:53] services in exchange for SATs or maybe
[41:57] middlemen and intermediators that can
[41:59] come and make it possible where if
[42:02] somebody wants to pay in SS they're able
[42:04] to do that and even if the person on the
[42:06] other end of the line wants to receive
[42:08] the money in Fiat the transaction can
[42:11] still happen one is paying in SATs and
[42:13] one gets to receive their money in Fiat
[42:16] so these are some of the problems that I
[42:18] would
[42:19] say on a and obviously education in
[42:22] terms of to deal with problem number one
[42:26] of the scams
[42:27] a lot of people like they just hear oh
[42:30] there's this thing called Bitcoin it's
[42:32] making everybody Rich right but without
[42:37] necessarily understanding or going down
[42:40] or taking time to really figure out okay
[42:42] what is bitcoin what is it not what is
[42:45] the difference between Bitcoin and um
[42:49] all these other scams proring to be
[42:51] Bitcoin or what is the difference
[42:53] between Bitcoin and you know other old
[42:56] coin coins that might where people have
[43:00] had different old coins or um rug poool
[43:04] projects pitched to them where they're
[43:06] told this is just like Bitcoin but if
[43:09] you buy this this is actually cheaper
[43:11] than Bitcoin because it will cost you
[43:13] $60,000 to buy a Bitcoin but this is
[43:16] just like 25 cents so you would rather
[43:19] get into this and when the price Rises
[43:21] it will likely rise like Bitcoin but
[43:25] this is your opportunity you miss the
[43:26] boat on bit Co but now you can get on
[43:29] into this at 25 cents a piece and this
[43:33] is how a lot of people because they
[43:34] don't understand the difference between
[43:36] these different um projects or let's say
[43:40] between Bitcoin and everything else
[43:43] so the scamming is on steroids when it
[43:47] comes to a lot of um a lot of these
[43:50] factors and a lot of these
[43:52] projects and
[43:54] um you don't have as many circular
[43:57] economies or I believe that's perhaps
[44:00] the final solution where you would have
[44:03] a lot of these circular economies being
[44:05] built where people are earning in
[44:07] Bitcoin and spending in Bitcoin so it
[44:10] immediately removes the need first of
[44:13] all to go to an exchange to buy because
[44:16] you're already receiving your earnings
[44:18] in
[44:18] Bitcoin and it removes the need as well
[44:22] to change it back into Fiat because
[44:24] you're spending it in set so there are
[44:27] people um Bitcoin
[44:31] aasi um The Project based out of Mosel
[44:34] Bay here in South Africa you've got
[44:37] others Bitcoin Victoria Falls up in
[44:40] Zambia which are also doing education
[44:42] where the ultimate goal is to get to a
[44:45] point where they are going to have this
[44:47] these Bitcoin circular economies
[44:50] happening and it's a it's still I would
[44:54] say early days for a lot of these proct
[44:57] project some are
[44:58] obviously um a bit ahead than others
[45:02] we've got again in South Africa Bitcoin
[45:05] vant which is like a small
[45:07] community uh a town of about I believe
[45:11] I've got my numbers right 500 to th000
[45:13] people but the Bitcoin adoption there is
[45:16] massive and the merchant adoption has
[45:19] happened on a much bigger
[45:21] scale and within that town you can
[45:24] actually transact in bit coin you can
[45:27] tip in Bitcoin and um with a a whole lot
[45:30] of different um things that happening
[45:35] that are happening along the line in
[45:36] between so I believe these are some of
[45:39] the solutions that even remittances as
[45:41] well because you also have a large
[45:44] section of the a of the African
[45:46] population within the diaspora that send
[45:49] money back home and this is another I
[45:53] would say low hanging fruit where you
[45:56] could
[45:57] use Bitcoin
[45:59] to also get people to adopt it in that
[46:03] um regard yeah just to name a few of the
[46:07] areas and a few of the potential
[46:09] solutions that could increase adoption
[46:12] on the
[46:16] continent oh that's that's super
[46:18] interesting Al when when
[46:21] we when we talk about increasing
[46:23] adoption I think there are a lot of I
[46:25] think it all kind of boils St down
[46:27] fundamentally to to education and and
[46:29] bringing better knowledge also to to the
[46:32] people um I'm curious on how cbdcs are
[46:39] uh perceived uh in in Africa I know in
[46:43] Germany Austria and maybe also in
[46:45] America but definitely from Europe I
[46:47] know it um they are really afraid of
[46:49] them because everyone has a bank account
[46:51] everyone is kyc everyone has the
[46:54] government IDs like everyone is very uh
[46:57] entrenched with the government system um
[47:00] but it seems like maybe in Africa
[47:02] they're not as afraid of cbdcs or maybe
[47:05] they don't see it that much because uh
[47:09] the the the the bank and the government
[47:11] is a little bit further away from the
[47:13] people and not that much deep into the
[47:15] the Privacy so with
[47:18] cbdcs Africa being as diverse as it is
[47:21] you're going to obviously there are
[47:24] regions where no one is even thinking
[47:26] about them
[47:27] where they they yet to even know what a
[47:30] cbdc is because they're
[47:34] still they've got bigger problems let me
[47:37] let me put it like that
[47:40] so cbdc is not even something at least
[47:44] if you're going to consider it from a
[47:46] general population view it's not the
[47:49] conversation happening at the dinner
[47:51] table in a lot of um African countries
[47:54] or at the supermarket or at the cafes or
[47:58] wherever right it's not because a lot of
[48:01] them don't even have some of them don't
[48:02] even have functional Financial
[48:05] systems and the flip side to that is
[48:09] it's in those regions that I think
[48:11] perhaps would
[48:14] become easier to capture for cbdcs
[48:17] because it would be very easy
[48:20] for for the argument to be made that
[48:23] once we introduce a cbdc we will have
[48:26] full full scale Financial
[48:28] inclusion and that fullscale Financial
[48:31] inclusion will help deal with a lot of
[48:33] the transactional issues that you face
[48:35] on a day-to-day basis so in those places
[48:38] I think that the concern is because
[48:43] currently it's not a conversation it's
[48:44] not a topic of discussion because of the
[48:46] dysfunctional Financial systems they
[48:48] have but once someone comes and says hey
[48:52] here's a solution to you don't have to
[48:54] go all the way to for like 50 kilomet
[48:58] away to get to the nearest bank just
[49:00] download this application in fact before
[49:02] you just for downloading it you're going
[49:04] to get uh $10 for free courtesy of the
[49:08] state that you can use to buy groceries
[49:11] and I see that becoming like something
[49:13] that can be used to hook these uh at
[49:17] least people in these regions
[49:19] particularly those that haven't really
[49:21] looked into what cbdcs are and what
[49:24] they're actually going to be implemented
[49:26] for
[49:27] then on the other side you do have
[49:30] people where these conversations are
[49:31] happening like Nigeria they did roll out
[49:34] a cbdc I believe two years ago and the
[49:38] adoption has been dismal to say the
[49:40] least which is good
[49:41] news
[49:44] um the the people did not respond
[49:48] positively despite the different
[49:51] regulations and different um incentives
[49:54] as well that were put as a way of
[49:57] getting them to kind of adopt the cbdc
[50:00] platform I think they're close to
[50:02] shutting down that project if they
[50:04] haven't already because of the fact that
[50:07] the adoption didn't go as well as they
[50:09] had hoped or planned it was and I think
[50:13] there they took a more calculated
[50:15] approach where they actually first had
[50:19] quote unquote problems with cash
[50:21] withdrawals in a cash economy that
[50:23] becomes a very big thing so now imagine
[50:26] you've got cash limits and you've got
[50:29] issues getting cash to withdraw Nigeria
[50:32] they did roll out a
[50:34] cbdc and when they did roll it out there
[50:37] were certain regulations that they
[50:39] passed as a way of trying to force
[50:42] people um without saying it out front or
[50:47] UPF front that this is what's going on
[50:49] but the adoption rate plummeted so bad
[50:52] that I believe that uh last time I
[50:55] checked there were reconsiderations to
[50:57] pull the plug on the project because no
[51:00] one is using it no one is touching it so
[51:04] I I think that you do have particularly
[51:07] given the fact that the Nigerian naira
[51:09] as well it's one of those currencies
[51:12] that also experiences a lot of
[51:14] fluctuations and it's not one of it's
[51:18] not as stable as you would like but even
[51:21] with that it wasn't enough to convince
[51:23] people to use a cbdc so out basic Bally
[51:27] say for the most part of
[51:29] Africa
[51:31] um once they understand what is cbdc is
[51:35] actually meant to do most people are not
[51:38] for it and I think it becomes given
[51:42] the the way things
[51:45] are uh the financial infrastructure in a
[51:48] lot of countries it would be very it
[51:51] would not be as easy to roll out a cbdc
[51:55] in Africa as say within the EU or in the
[51:58] US or some of these
[52:00] places but having said that the
[52:05] education with regards to or at least
[52:09] the knowledge with regards to what cbdcs
[52:11] are and the threats that they POs to
[52:14] personal freedom and particularly the
[52:16] freedom to transact most people aren't
[52:19] really aware of it so the same issues
[52:22] problems that we're talking about that
[52:25] um created a financial exclusionary type
[52:29] economy or
[52:32] environment in on another side or from
[52:34] Another Side are kind of some of the
[52:37] reasons why a cbdc probably wouldn't
[52:40] work in Africa unless of course if you
[52:44] consider stable coins to be pseudo cbdcs
[52:47] then that's a different um topic and
[52:49] discussion all together but generally
[52:52] speaking I don't think that um Central B
[52:56] banks in this part of the world even
[52:58] though you do have certain like I
[53:00] mentioned Nigeria and even the South
[53:02] African Central Bank was running
[53:05] experiments um before with regards to
[53:08] rolling out uh more like a crossborder
[53:11] wholesale
[53:13] cbdc um I think they carried it out with
[53:17] the Central Bank the monetary authority
[53:19] of
[53:20] Singapore and one other Central Bank two
[53:23] years ago I think it was called project
[53:25] Dunbar
[53:27] um where they ran this experiment to see
[53:29] how it would be like to roll out a
[53:31] wholesale cbdc so there are experiments
[53:34] that central banks on the continent are
[53:36] doing as to how that would be rolled out
[53:39] but in terms of the Grassroots adoption
[53:42] of it I don't see it happening in any
[53:46] way shape or form given that in any case
[53:49] it's a most people actually still prefer
[53:52] to use cash with few exceptions where
[53:55] you have you know know robust banking
[53:57] system so it's either cash or mobile
[53:59] money other than
[54:02] that yeah it's out would say we're still
[54:05] very far from a place where maybe 10 15
[54:08] years maybe 20 from where we can
[54:11] actually start to see a cbdc that works
[54:15] I mean Nigeria did roll it out but
[54:17] didn't really work yeah absolutely it's
[54:20] interesting uh cbdcs it's I think we are
[54:23] I I just hope that we can move from a
[54:25] normal Fe system directly to bitcoin and
[54:28] don't have to go through like that
[54:30] cbdc kind of a time at least that's like
[54:33] my dream state I mean like cbdcs is just
[54:37] feed money on steroids so I just like
[54:40] feed money with like more control in
[54:43] that so I hope we we can avoid that to a
[54:45] certain extent um yeah really cool I L
[54:48] that a lot a lot already um one last
[54:52] question on that note how do you think
[54:55] uh Bitcoin will influence uh politics
[54:58] and governments and all all those things
[55:01] uh when they don't all of the sudden
[55:03] don't have the ability to print as much
[55:06] money as they want without consequences
[55:08] because even if feeld money is still
[55:11] around um Bitcoin represents an exit
[55:15] wealth and if they print too much all of
[55:17] a sudden the pying power goes to bitcoin
[55:20] so even if feat is still around Bitcoin
[55:22] will uh put a pressure onto feat and the
[55:26] state what do you think will be the
[55:28] influence or the impact on
[55:34] that well there there are many ways to
[55:36] answer that question first of all it
[55:39] depends on the nature of Bitcoin
[55:42] adoption that happens right particularly
[55:44] if we're talking from a nation state
[55:48] perspective because if you have an
[55:50] instance where let's assume for argument
[55:54] sake people will ISS is or certain
[55:57] countries let's take the US for example
[56:00] let's say they were to issue Bitcoin
[56:02] backed
[56:03] dollars the definition of Bitcoin backed
[56:06] of course that is Up For Debate and um
[56:10] but let's just for argument
[56:12] sake um for at least try to visualize a
[56:17] scenario in which the US government
[56:19] starts to issue Bitcoin back dollars
[56:22] right or some variation of the sort
[56:27] in a sense you are still having Fiat or
[56:30] the US dollar moving around as we know
[56:34] it but in in its structure and in its uh
[56:36] makeup it's different because now
[56:38] allegedly it's Bitcoin back so you're
[56:40] going to have certain countries that are
[56:43] not going to go straight up you know
[56:46] like the Salvador route where Bitcoin in
[56:49] in its purest form is used for
[56:51] transacting um it's used for paying
[56:53] taxes it's used for it's considered to
[56:56] be legal tender you're going to have
[57:00] maybe some nation states that will still
[57:02] try to hang on to their Fiat for the
[57:04] purposes of political control and for
[57:07] the purposes of um trying to keep the
[57:10] promises either they made to previous
[57:13] generations in the form of Pensions or
[57:15] to keep promises for whatever treaties
[57:18] that may have been signed trade treaties
[57:20] trade agreements you name it but those
[57:23] the validity of those agreements or
[57:26] promises if you like depend on the
[57:29] government having that ability to
[57:31] control the money printer so you will
[57:35] have instances where you have Bitcoin
[57:37] adoption in name
[57:39] only and then people still trying to do
[57:42] the whole Shenanigans kind of like what
[57:43] you had with gold right where initially
[57:47] how we got to Fiat was Fiat was
[57:50] basically paper money acting as a gold
[57:53] receipt and then eventually it got to
[57:55] where slowly but surely we eventually
[57:58] moved away from that so I will I can
[58:02] actually foresee a scenario where you
[58:03] can have something similar like that
[58:05] happen where there'll be some sort of
[58:08] um attempt to
[58:11] cheat that um 21 million Supply cap and
[58:16] all of those other rules that come along
[58:18] with Bitcoin adoption because quite
[58:20] frankly if you really think about it for
[58:23] a country to go full-blown on a Bitcoin
[58:25] standard
[58:27] particularly where they have printed
[58:28] more money than value produced which is
[58:32] most
[58:33] countries and where they're heavily
[58:36] indebted which is most countries again
[58:39] how then do you balance the books if you
[58:41] say without doing like a hard cut back
[58:46] or reset of some sort so the only way
[58:49] you're probably going to try to balance
[58:51] those books to make those things kind of
[58:54] match up is you're to have kind of a
[58:57] pseudo Bitcoin standard as a way of one
[59:00] still trying to maintain confidence and
[59:02] say to everybody hey we are on a Bitcoin
[59:05] standard just like everybody else what
[59:06] can we learn from you besides
[59:13] Bitcoin oh that's an interesting
[59:15] question what can you learn from me
[59:17] besides
[59:19] Bitcoin I would say
[59:22] highte besides Bitcoin um
[59:26] writing is one of those things I really
[59:29] enjoy doing and I've been told that my
[59:35] writing is great hopefully that wasn't a
[59:38] lie but um assuming that to be
[59:42] true I think that's one of the things
[59:45] that um you could learn from me
[59:49] because in in and of itself it's an art
[59:53] where you're just putting your thoughts
[59:55] on pap paper in a way that another
[59:57] person who's not in your mind can pick
[60:00] up that piece of paper digital or
[60:03] otherwise and read it and kind of read
[60:05] your mind from reading that piece of
[60:08] paper so that's what I always strive to
[60:11] do when I write to create a mirror image
[60:17] of in a at a point in time where you
[60:20] timestamp it that at this point in time
[60:23] or at blog height such and such this
[60:26] this is what I was thinking and these
[60:27] were some of the ideas that I wanted to
[60:30] communicate and this is how I chose to
[60:33] communicate them and lay them out so
[60:37] definitely I would say the thing that
[60:39] immediately comes to mind for me would
[60:41] be writing although I'm not the best
[60:44] wrer on the planet but I do believe I'm
[60:46] moderately okay yeah absolutely really
[60:50] cool I think writing is something very
[60:53] um it's very important I feel like for
[60:55] the for the human brain to to develop um
[60:58] especially if you do it like that but
[61:00] even on the laptop or something like
[61:01] that is really really cool then we have
[61:03] the end routine of the previous guest is
[61:05] asking a question for the next guest
[61:07] without knowing who the next guest
[61:08] actually is and there's an interesting
[61:10] one the qu the uh previous guest asks
[61:13] you uh what will it take for you to walk
[61:16] away from Bitcoin um the background to
[61:19] that and the context to that is um you
[61:23] always like if we assume that we got
[61:26] Bitcoin and before we thought Bitcoin
[61:28] might be a scam we discovered that we
[61:31] are wrong about something and uh maybe
[61:35] we are also wrong about Bitcoin how do
[61:38] we know what needs to happen that we
[61:40] know that we actually wrong about
[61:43] Bitcoin like that's kind of the the
[61:44] question from
[61:45] him okay so the question
[61:50] is if let's assume we are wrong about
[61:54] Bitcoin or let's assume
[61:56] how would you know that you're wrong
[61:58] about Bitcoin and then what level of
[62:02] being wrong would be enough for you to
[62:04] walk away is
[62:06] that the gist of the question
[62:09] okay wow what a
[62:13] question I'll answer it from the end of
[62:16] it going backwards like I'll start with
[62:18] what would it take for me to walk away
[62:22] what would it take for me to walk away
[62:24] from Bitcoin
[62:26] I guess when it gets to a point
[62:29] where
[62:32] it's if Bitcoin let's say does get
[62:35] captured in the same way Fiat was
[62:38] captured
[62:40] where all of the things that made it
[62:42] special things like let's say the 21
[62:45] million Supply cap if that was to be
[62:48] tampered
[62:50] with um let's say if we got to a point
[62:54] where once again we went off of proof of
[62:58] work to something like um proof of
[63:01] stake and where we ended up with let's
[63:07] say some noes which would be kind of a
[63:11] buildup to the previous point where not
[63:15] all nodes are equal and other nodes are
[63:17] more important you know than
[63:21] others
[63:24] and I think once we get to a point where
[63:28] you have those kind of things in play
[63:31] what you will have there is some sort of
[63:34] digital currency or you could even argue
[63:37] a distributed
[63:40] cbdc but it won't be Bitcoin any longer
[63:42] once you remove those two components
[63:44] where it's no longer proof of work based
[63:47] and it's no longer it doesn't have that
[63:49] 21 million Supply cap and I think those
[63:52] are hardlines for me that would be
[63:55] enough for me to call it quits and like
[63:58] Satoshi to say I'm moving on to other
[64:01] thing even though the project is no
[64:03] longer in good hands you know type of
[64:06] thing and how would we know if we're
[64:10] wrong I think there is no one
[64:14] way it depends on what we would Define
[64:17] as being wrong right Are We Wrong to you
[64:21] want a peer-to-peer
[64:23] electronic form of money that preserves
[64:27] privacy and that can that doesn't
[64:29] require a third party to transact no we
[64:32] are not wrong about that are we wrong to
[64:36] say that we
[64:39] have we need a trustless
[64:42] system particularly where trust is
[64:45] continually violated by the people that
[64:47] we entrust to make the right decisions
[64:51] whether they be Central Bankers
[64:52] government officials the list goes on
[64:55] and on
[64:57] we are not wrong about that I guess the
[65:00] one thing perhaps that we could
[65:02] potentially be wrong about is maybe the
[65:06] design of what Bitcoin looks like
[65:11] today given the threat levels that we're
[65:14] facing and given how the future is
[65:16] unfolding maybe I don't know I doubt it
[65:20] but that's the one area perhaps that I
[65:24] can foresee that would could potentially
[65:26] be wrong about more about how Bitcoin
[65:29] exists today and how it is
[65:32] designed which would lead some people to
[65:35] say maybe let's remove the 21 million
[65:38] Supply cap let's tamper with the supply
[65:41] schedule you know let's uh go over to a
[65:44] proof of State type system and we're
[65:47] back to Fiat once again
[65:50] so the the philosophical underpinnings
[65:53] of Bitcoin I believe are in act and
[65:56] they're genuine and they're based in
[65:58] truth and they're based in a desire and
[65:59] the Love For
[66:01] Freedom what might be wrong if anything
[66:04] is wrong might have to do perhaps with
[66:07] the current implementation of it
[66:11] perhaps a better implementation would be
[66:14] required I don't know but this is just
[66:17] me speculating and you know playing with
[66:20] my mind and going into those places that
[66:23] perhaps to me would be the
[66:26] that I would use to measure
[66:28] that yeah yeah really cool uh it's
[66:32] interesting uh for me when you think
[66:34] about that question but I think you you
[66:35] answered it really really really good um
[66:38] then thank you so much uh could goodai
[66:41] already for taking your time before I
[66:42] let you go where can people find you ask
[66:44] your questions read more about
[66:48] youa my name and surname as one and um
[66:53] I'm also on Noster at
[66:56] Kai um I I I'll send also the npub so
[67:00] that if need be you can include it in
[67:03] the show notes and I also write for
[67:06] Bitcoin magazine you can also find a lot
[67:10] of my work there
[67:13] um and on freedom Tech as well so those
[67:17] are there are many other avenues that I
[67:20] utilize for writing but those would be
[67:22] my main ones and I will also include all
[67:25] the information as well in addition to
[67:27] those but those are like the key places
