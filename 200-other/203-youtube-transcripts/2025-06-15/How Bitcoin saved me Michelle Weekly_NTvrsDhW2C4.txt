[00:00] the price crashed and and no one would
[00:01] talk to me people really have no idea I
[00:05] fell into the Trap of how did you come
[00:08] up with the idea everyone was sort of
[00:09] like wow like you know you've made it
[00:12] but pretty quickly I started to see like
[00:14] there is a heavy cost to all of this and
[00:16] the cost is like keeping your mouth shut
[00:19] about the corruption and the lies and
[00:21] and everything that you see that's wild
[00:23] that is really wild when I came back to
[00:25] the States it blew my mind how dishonest
[00:29] everyone was being obviously in China
[00:31] there's a lot of censorship but the
[00:33] censorship here in the United States is
[00:36] worse since when can we not just have a
[00:40] conversation you also started a podcast
[00:42] right I I'm in the process it's kind of
[00:44] on hold uh I had an idea to or it really
[00:48] sort of developed naturally uh because I
[00:51] was having all of these incredible
[00:53] conversations with people that I went to
[00:56] boarding school with and that I knew in
[00:58] DC you know people with very high level
[01:02] jobs um on Wall Street and politics and
[01:05] things like that and and I would get
[01:07] like the craziest questions from them
[01:09] and I was just like I have to record
[01:11] these conversations and of course once I
[01:14] you know did the research and kind of
[01:16] got myself organized then then the the
[01:19] price crashed and and no one would talk
[01:21] to me they didn't care so I'm starting
[01:24] to get a a little bit of phone calls and
[01:27] interest again I think as the number
[01:30] goes up you know we get attention and
[01:33] and the people the the normies the no
[01:35] coiners right they start to call you
[01:38] again so I'm just kind of waiting for
[01:39] that I I tried to chase everybody down
[01:42] for a little while and and get them to
[01:44] talk to me and they're interest was just
[01:46] so low um so the whole point really was
[01:50] to talk to people who were pre- Bitcoin
[01:53] right people who are not in our little
[01:55] worlds here um so I have to wait for
[01:58] them to be ready but I think the time
[02:01] will come soon we'll get those the ETF
[02:03] approvals here in the United States and
[02:05] they'll all want to talk to me so as
[02:07] soon as that happens I will be hitting
[02:09] record and I will have my podcast that's
[02:11] an interesting thing having people
[02:15] outside of Bitcoin uh in the Bitcoin
[02:18] podcast will it be like question like
[02:21] how will the format go so just casual
[02:25] conversations um I'll tell you the the
[02:29] very specific question that clicked in
[02:33] my brain is I had this great guy who I
[02:35] went to boarding school with um he's
[02:38] really smart he is uh in charge uh I
[02:42] don't want to dox him but he he has a
[02:44] really high-profile job in the Live
[02:46] Events world and he's super super smart
[02:50] very successful and we sat down um and
[02:53] he said to me so if I buy Bitcoin what
[02:58] happens like do do do I get anything
[03:01] physical and I I just died laughing like
[03:04] no the whole point you know it's digital
[03:06] whatever and he kind of stopped me and
[03:08] he was like look this is not a dumb
[03:11] question because until 2013 which you
[03:15] know 10 years ago now but not that long
[03:17] ago when you purchase certain stocks on
[03:20] the US Stock Exchange they would mail
[03:23] you a physical certificate of
[03:27] ownership yeah and so I thought wow like
[03:31] I I actually didn't really know that
[03:32] when I thought about it I thought oh
[03:34] yeah I do kind of remember my parents
[03:36] maybe having those I remember being
[03:38] aware of that um but you know that
[03:42] opened up this whole conversation and it
[03:44] just struck me like the you know the
[03:48] bitcoiners might laugh at that question
[03:50] as I did I laughed but then when he
[03:53] explained his perspective and kind of
[03:54] why he was asking and where the question
[03:56] came from my mind was a little bit blown
[04:00] like wow we are so far ahead than we
[04:03] even know you know you get off Twitter
[04:06] you get outside the world of Bitcoin and
[04:09] people really have no idea even the
[04:12] people you know uh that we look at and
[04:15] maybe deemed like very successful or
[04:18] smart in whatever industry that they're
[04:20] working within
[04:23] so basically I'm just going to say to my
[04:25] friends I'll answer all your questions
[04:27] but you have to let me record the
[04:28] conversation
[04:31] that's an interesting concept it be
[04:33] interesting how many people are willing
[04:34] to like get on a Bitcoin podcast without
[04:38] being in Bitcoin it's like interesting
[04:41] right well so far not no that's not true
[04:44] I I do have two episodes recorded one is
[04:47] with my brother who I kind of bullied
[04:48] into talking to me and the other is a
[04:52] super interesting conversation that I
[04:54] had with a former colleague of mine who
[04:57] lives in China and he man manages uh a
[05:01] media Network there and a huge network
[05:03] of outbound investment organizations so
[05:07] basically wealthy people in China who
[05:10] are trying to take their money out of
[05:12] the country and so again even with him I
[05:17] presumed his knowledge to be Way Beyond
[05:19] where it was uh they use tether they use
[05:23] you know usdt to transact when they
[05:27] can't get in and out of dollars
[05:30] um and so I I thought he would know a
[05:34] lot more than he did and and he really
[05:35] did and he had a ton of questions for me
[05:38] and that was a super interesting
[05:39] conversation that's interesting about
[05:41] you uh in general I researched a little
[05:43] bit
[05:44] and you have a pretty rich before
[05:47] Bitcoin life like for example for me I'm
[05:50] 25 now and I'm in Bitcoin uh I'm getting
[05:54] to the four years Mark so my basically
[05:57] I'm I'm I lift up my profession career
[06:00] and with Bitcoin okay and you are 35
[06:06] around that I'm a little older than that
[06:09] but I I'm almost 40 so I'm older than
[06:13] people think I am yeah yeah so you for
[06:17] in 20 years ago you basically were like
[06:21] around 20 like before 20 and there were
[06:24] no Bitcoin how did your whole uh growing
[06:28] up in a world started I did I did and I
[06:32] really was caught up in it um it's super
[06:36] interesting for me to look back with a
[06:39] new lens um I you know I knew nothing I
[06:43] I'm so jealous I think I wish obviously
[06:47] that I had discovered Bitcoin earlier I
[06:50] think it's incredible the opportunity
[06:52] that you have I you know I certainly I
[06:55] am not bothered by my age I think
[06:57] there's lots of Life uh to be lived
[07:00] still but yeah I look back um do you
[07:02] know Eric
[07:04] KAS no are you familiar with him so Eric
[07:07] Cason talks about um Occupy Wall Street
[07:11] and how you know he got into Bitcoin
[07:13] because of Occupy Wall Street which of
[07:14] course is sort of the beginning of
[07:17] Bitcoin you know if we look back um
[07:21] Bitcoin kind of came out of Occupy Wall
[07:23] Street are you familiar with with the
[07:25] Occupy Wall Street movement no okay so
[07:28] this is um
[07:30] basically it was a very significant and
[07:34] prolonged protest that happened here in
[07:36] the United States um in 2008 prior to
[07:40] the massive crash that happened and then
[07:44] the bank
[07:45] bailouts um it might have been in
[07:47] response to the bank bailouts I I'm not
[07:50] I should do some research and and get
[07:52] more familiar with that but what I what
[07:55] I do know is that the Occupy Wall Street
[07:57] protests were happening in DC um right
[08:01] at the Federal Reserve right downtown by
[08:03] the the White House and during that time
[08:07] I was working in in startup world and
[08:10] the garage that I parked in I would walk
[08:13] past the
[08:14] protesters every single day for weeks
[08:17] they were they had these um Parks
[08:19] occupied and I remember being so annoyed
[08:22] and frustrated just at the actual like
[08:25] Logistics of the protest because it was
[08:27] an inconvenience to me and you know at
[08:29] the time I was working really long days
[08:32] I was going in early I was leaving late
[08:34] and it was just like oh another thing I
[08:36] have to deal with to get you know home
[08:38] and and back on my computer um and I
[08:42] didn't understand at the
[08:44] time really you know now of course I
[08:47] agree so strongly with everything that
[08:50] they were fighting against and sort of
[08:53] rallying around but I think this speaks
[08:57] to the divides that are created like I
[09:02] have always thought of myself as very
[09:04] libertarian I didn't want to be involved
[09:05] in politics kind of like Live and Let
[09:09] Live and I fell into the Trap of you
[09:14] know being divided and kind of turned
[09:16] against these people because they were
[09:20] very politically active and they were
[09:21] fighting the system and and what you
[09:23] don't realize until you really take the
[09:24] time to study it all is that we really
[09:27] all want the same thing and were really
[09:29] a lot more aligned than you know the
[09:34] globalist agenda would have you believe
[09:36] or your you know local polit like
[09:41] political higher ups or or whatever you
[09:43] want to call them I think there is
[09:47] around the world there's an agenda to
[09:49] keep people divided so that we can't
[09:52] cooperate and and better fight the
[09:55] systems and when did you throw that uh
[09:57] fear mindset of your
[10:00] life it was not
[10:03] until
[10:05] 2017 um admittedly I just kept in My
[10:10] Fiat career I moved to Dubai um you know
[10:15] I worked in startups so a lot of my
[10:17] friends and colleagues were moving to
[10:19] Silicon Valley and I didn't want to do
[10:22] that so I got this crazy idea to move to
[10:25] Dubai and I did that and it wasn't until
[10:30] I got recruited to work in foreign
[10:32] direct investment I don't know did you
[10:34] read the pinned tweet yeah yes but I'm
[10:37] I'm really interested how did you come
[10:38] up with the idea to move to
[10:41] Dubai like uh I moved uh once to Munich
[10:46] but this was completely work related I
[10:49] okay I would not come up with myself
[10:51] like oh let's let's just move to
[10:53] something completely else I I've always
[10:56] kind of gone Against the Grain I have
[10:58] always you know if everyone was doing
[11:00] something I just naturally didn't want
[11:02] to do it so again everyone assumed that
[11:05] I would move to Silicon Valley and and I
[11:08] thought no I don't want to do it um so I
[11:11] I had fortunately this period of time um
[11:16] where I was able to travel and I started
[11:19] going places I spent a fair amount of
[11:22] time in Europe I went to all the islands
[11:24] in the Caribbean and I got bored very
[11:26] quickly I was like this is all kind of
[11:29] the same so I was exploring online you
[11:33] know I'm on Facebook Instagram and I
[11:35] actually found this friend from like
[11:38] Middle School who was living in Abu
[11:40] Dhabi and I thought now this is a place
[11:43] I know nothing about um so I got in
[11:47] touch with them and ended up going to
[11:49] visit and I was there initially for two
[11:52] weeks and by the end of that two weeks I
[11:55] just made up my mind like everything
[11:58] there is is wild you know it it
[12:00] admittedly is very Fiat lots of
[12:03] supercars you know lots of show and have
[12:07] you ever been to Dubai yes but I was
[12:09] really uh small like I was like 15 or
[12:12] something with my parents okay you know
[12:15] it Dubai has a an a reputation and I
[12:17] think it's accurate but to me it was
[12:19] just really interesting it was one of
[12:21] the first places I had ever been that
[12:24] was not the same as everywhere else and
[12:27] that's what I wanted I am always trying
[12:29] to learn and find new things
[12:33] so I've also just kind of been like all
[12:36] right let's do it and I I was there
[12:39] visiting like I said and I thought this
[12:41] is where I'm going to go I I really
[12:43] wanted to get out of DC I think I was
[12:45] starting to feel you know um
[12:52] the I didn't know it at the time but
[12:54] it's all of these Fiat systems that sort
[12:57] of run your life and I didn't want to
[12:59] get caught up in that so I thought by
[13:01] leaving DC that I would get out of it
[13:04] and you know of course I just ended up
[13:06] in this crazy adventure um but it it led
[13:11] me here so I think I'm okay with that
[13:14] and when did you then uh get rid of the
[13:17] Fiat mindset so I got recruited I was
[13:20] working for a consulting company in
[13:21] foreign direct investment and I like to
[13:24] say this was like a crash course in Fiat
[13:27] corruption and I I I think at that time
[13:30] is when I learned really how much I had
[13:34] no I how much I didn't know you know I
[13:37] thought I was having success I was
[13:41] making more money than I'd ever made I
[13:43] had this you know cool title I had an
[13:46] unchecked expense account everyone was
[13:49] sort of like wow like you know you've
[13:51] made it and that's how I felt for a
[13:53] little while but pretty quickly I
[13:55] started to see like there is a heavy
[13:57] cost to all of of this um and the cost
[14:01] is like keeping your mouth shut about
[14:03] the corruption and the lies and and
[14:06] everything that you see so that made me
[14:08] very uneasy and I
[14:10] lasted not quite for not quite about two
[14:13] years just a little less than two years
[14:16] I worked in this world um and I I burnt
[14:19] out in flames and I'm not going to lie
[14:22] it took a little while for me to process
[14:25] everything in retrospect and really
[14:27] understand what had happened and
[14:29] why so I knew something was wrong you
[14:33] know much sooner than I knew
[14:37] really all of the details and understood
[14:41] the
[14:41] complexities um but that started my
[14:44] journey and I you know I'm still
[14:46] learning I
[14:48] uh I think it's an endless task so the
[14:52] Fe system basically burned you out it
[14:56] did it burnt me out very
[14:59] seriously um and so I just sort of like
[15:04] laid low for a while and studied I put
[15:07] my you know head kind of into the sand
[15:09] and studied everything that I could so
[15:12] that I
[15:13] understood the systems I I knew the
[15:15] system the systems were all being
[15:18] manipulated but I didn't understand the
[15:20] systems well enough you know I
[15:23] remember starting to consume like the
[15:27] macro conver ations that we see
[15:29] everywhere in Bitcoin and I didn't I
[15:31] didn't even know what Fiat was um you
[15:36] know I I had been through economics
[15:37] classes I had been through University
[15:41] and had a degree and all of these things
[15:43] and I remember thinking like wait Fiat
[15:45] I'm I'm not sure that I understand
[15:47] completely what that means you know
[15:49] Austrian economics I was not super
[15:51] familiar with um and in retrospect you
[15:55] know you kind of you start to understand
[15:57] these things and and then you start to
[15:59] understand I think the next level is
[16:02] seeing that the ignorance is by Design
[16:04] you know when you take a an economics
[16:07] class they're teaching you Kenyan
[16:10] economics and there's no discussion to
[16:13] Alternatives that you know as far as
[16:16] they're concerned there's no alternative
[16:18] system that
[16:19] exists yeah it's funny I I talked last
[16:22] week with someone that studied uh
[16:25] economics in Austria and I've I asked
[16:27] him okay as a economic students in
[16:30] Austria did you heard about Austrian
[16:32] economics before Bitcoin and he's like
[16:34] no right was that was nothing in the
[16:38] university and he fulfilled the
[16:41] university nothing with Austrian
[16:42] economics in
[16:45] Austria that's wild that is really wild
[16:49] yeah you you know you you start to have
[16:52] these conversations and and look at it
[16:54] and I mean even that that's eye opening
[16:56] you know um
[16:59] it it's it has to be by Design I I think
[17:02] you can't understand any of it and not
[17:05] understand that it's by Design um but of
[17:08] course the learning curve is massive not
[17:11] only to learn all of these uh learn all
[17:14] of this but to unlearn I think that's
[17:17] really what takes the time right is to
[17:19] unlearn everything we've learned and
[17:21] then you're open
[17:22] to everything
[17:25] else that's crazy so you through your
[17:29] Fiat mindset slowly because the Fiat
[17:31] system basically burned you out uh you
[17:34] you learned your lesson you learned the
[17:37] system and then you find Bitcoin how did
[17:40] you manage
[17:42] that so I first heard about Bitcoin uh
[17:46] thanks to a Russian kid at a conference
[17:51] in Cena
[17:54] Colombia and I was sitting in a corner
[17:57] um I was you know at the tail end of
[18:01] that career really wanting out but not
[18:04] understanding exactly how I could get
[18:06] out yet um and he said to me have you
[18:11] ever heard of
[18:12] cryptocurrency do you know you know what
[18:15] Bitcoin is do you know what ethereum is
[18:18] um and so I didn't I hadn't I I I kind
[18:22] of triggered in my brain I had some
[18:25] friends in DC in like 2011 that were on
[18:28] Silk Road um and so they say you know
[18:31] like when's the first time that you
[18:33] ignore ignored Bitcoin which I would say
[18:35] was 2011 um but this time I was in a
[18:39] very different place and so I was really
[18:43] desperately looking for a way out of the
[18:46] Fiat world and so I had the conversation
[18:50] with this guy and I went and looked up
[18:53] everything that I could find I Googled
[18:55] you know Bitcoin I actually set up a
[18:57] Google alert so that every single hit
[19:01] that out in the wild anytime Bitcoin was
[19:04] mentioned it would come to my inbox and
[19:07] I don't know that you could do this now
[19:09] because it's you know it's everywhere
[19:11] it's more ubiquitous um but at the time
[19:14] there was relevant information coming in
[19:16] from you know just really random
[19:19] websites or news articles or blogs
[19:23] and again I think it's one of these
[19:25] things where the more I learned about
[19:27] that the more I realized I needed to go
[19:30] learn about other things so that I could
[19:33] understand them and you know I guess let
[19:37] them go what did what did Bitcoin made
[19:41] you like what in Bitcoin made you click
[19:44] like what what learning or what uh
[19:48] sentence you heard what interview what
[19:50] made you oh wow that's that's the thing
[19:53] there's been a couple
[19:56] um you know I think
[19:59] think the the concept
[20:02] of Bitcoin being unconfiscatable was
[20:05] really important to me um I understood
[20:09] you know almost
[20:11] immediately that they could affect or
[20:16] regulate the on and off ramps but as
[20:18] long as you have your Bitcoin in Cold
[20:21] Storage it's yours and so that was one
[20:25] of the most powerful things for me
[20:29] um and just being able
[20:32] to transact or participate outside of
[20:37] the system has always been the most
[20:40] important thing um I think in you know
[20:46] when I started I really a lot of it for
[20:48] me was about the technology and also
[20:51] being outside the system but I I studied
[20:53] the technology first because you know I
[20:55] was working in startups and and my
[20:57] background is computer science science
[20:59] but in more recent years like
[21:01] after more recently I would say that the
[21:05] thing that I share most right now is the
[21:09] Michael sailor interview with Tucker
[21:11] Carlson where he talks about energy and
[21:14] how Bitcoin you know takes your the
[21:17] energy of your productivity and allows
[21:19] you to save it and to really own it so
[21:24] there have been a lot of things over the
[21:25] years but since that came out out I
[21:28] think to me that's been the most
[21:30] powerful
[21:32] thing and you not only went ahead and
[21:36] saved your financial energy in Bitcoin
[21:38] but you also moved your business career
[21:42] and your um career in general to bitcoin
[21:46] why did you why did you do
[21:48] that I did that
[21:52] because it really became the only thing
[21:55] that I could bring myself to care about
[21:58] um I after I left Fiat world I did a
[22:02] little bit of Consulting cuz I I had to
[22:05] pay the bills um and I was working for
[22:10] myself and so I thought briefly okay I'm
[22:14] working for myself I'm safe right um
[22:18] from all of this that I've just burnt
[22:20] out of from Fiat world but what you
[22:22] realize really quickly is that you're
[22:25] still subject to having clients
[22:28] and what they might think of you like
[22:30] you can still get cancelled uh because I
[22:34] I found myself like being nervous to be
[22:37] honest about my opinions about things
[22:40] because I didn't I didn't want to lose
[22:42] my Consulting clients and so that didn't
[22:45] last very long um you know I'm like I
[22:48] just left my entire career because I
[22:52] didn't want to participate in lies I'm
[22:54] not going to do it in my own life um
[22:59] so I quit that and I just went full into
[23:03] fulltime into Bitcoin that's when I
[23:06] started tweeting and just being really
[23:09] honest about how I felt about everything
[23:13] um when I came back to the States it
[23:16] blew my mind how dishonest everyone was
[23:20] being um in the I was you know in Dubai
[23:24] in the Middle East in Asia I spent a lot
[23:26] of time in China there was a lot of very
[23:28] honest discourse about politics in the
[23:31] United States and of course this was a
[23:33] critical time Trump got elected and I
[23:37] was very shocked to come back to the US
[23:40] and find the absolute craziness you know
[23:43] I didn't really have an opinion because
[23:46] I hadn't been living here um but I was
[23:50] shocked at the degree to which you could
[23:52] no longer be honest and so ultimately
[23:56] Bitcoin became
[23:58] you know again the Escape where if you
[24:02] are being
[24:03] honest
[24:06] um Bitcoin represented the truth and I
[24:10] think that's really what drove me to the
[24:12] point where I couldn't care about
[24:15] anything but Bitcoin and and speaking
[24:18] the truth whatever the cost
[24:21] so that's an amazing Story how did did
[24:25] this change you
[24:28] further than just being able to tell the
[24:31] truth bit on a being completely on a
[24:34] Bitcoin standard kind of I think
[24:37] absolutely you know they say that you
[24:40] don't change Bitcoin Bitcoin changes you
[24:43] and I think that that's true
[24:46] um you know even in retrospect like I
[24:49] look back at at my career and and how
[24:53] much of my life was not honest like the
[24:57] the the job that I had in foreign direct
[25:00] investment I think is a really good
[25:02] example of that because everyone in my
[25:05] life you know thought that I was doing
[25:09] so well and I let them think that you
[25:13] know what what are you going to tell
[25:14] people no I I don't deserve the title
[25:17] that they gave me you know um it's not
[25:22] all it's cracked up to be like Oh I'm
[25:25] I'm actually broke even though I'm
[25:27] making all the money because my expenses
[25:29] are so high you know uh there's all of
[25:32] these truths that just getting or not
[25:36] truths but like
[25:39] um dishonesties I think that get built
[25:42] into our lives and it's a lot of work to
[25:47] unravel that you know I left that career
[25:51] and it took a long time to figure out
[25:52] how do I even
[25:55] explain that everything is a lie
[25:58] so you know you have to do a lot of work
[26:01] on yourself to get to a point where you
[26:05] can talk about that in a way that makes
[26:07] sense I still am often not sure that I'm
[26:10] articulating it well I need to do more
[26:12] work you know in explaining myself and
[26:15] and not just
[26:16] like rambling but yes I think Bitcoin
[26:19] really changes you and if you
[26:23] Embrace um Bitcoin and what Bitcoin
[26:26] stands for
[26:28] it's going to make you a better person
[26:29] it's going to improve your life in I I
[26:33] can't see any way in which it does not
[26:35] improve your life I you're now my 16th
[26:40] person that I interview and I try to get
[26:42] to as many bitcoiners as I possibly can
[26:45] I started with one person a week uh
[26:48] ramped it up to two persons now I'm
[26:50] thinking to start with three persons a
[26:52] week because I just love it so much and
[26:55] one thing stands out with all almost
[26:57] everybody I
[27:00] interviewed first of all they are all
[27:02] really unique persons um but second of
[27:05] all they had a Bitcoin moment and the
[27:10] Bitcoin moment was always a moment where
[27:13] their career their life their spir uh
[27:17] their like mindset and spirit also
[27:21] changed a little bit um why do you think
[27:24] Bitcoin can drastically change people I
[27:27] mean
[27:28] at truest form it's just money it's just
[27:30] an asset you can you can buy you can
[27:33] sell you can trade it with other people
[27:35] why does Bitcoin has this power of of
[27:38] changing
[27:40] people I think well I I want to say I
[27:43] agree with you completely um I love
[27:46] talking to bitcoiners and and living you
[27:49] know in this Bitcoin World Community
[27:53] whatever you want to call it um it is
[27:55] very powerful and I think the reason
[27:58] that it's so powerful
[28:02] is because it represents the truth and
[28:08] because Fiat really drives as I said you
[28:12] know I was really being dishonest with
[28:15] everyone including myself and so it's
[28:19] very very
[28:20] freeing to let go of all of that and not
[28:24] have to keep track of the L that you're
[28:27] telling everyone again including
[28:31] yourself
[28:32] um and just be yourself and be
[28:36] honest how could that not change you you
[28:40] know there's if you you look around and
[28:44] I'm really stuck on this speak up speak
[28:47] your truth and be honest that has become
[28:50] like my core Mission because I think
[28:52] that's the thing that frees you and
[28:55] Bitcoin allows you to do that so many of
[28:58] the problems that we see around us
[29:01] whether it's you know whatever whatever
[29:04] it may be there's a lot of problems
[29:06] right it's this endless task to list
[29:08] them but if everyone just spoke up I
[29:11] think we all agree on many things but
[29:14] people are too afraid to go against the
[29:18] herd and so they're too afraid to to
[29:20] speak up and say actually I'm not sure
[29:23] about that Bitcoin gives you I think the
[29:26] courage to speak up and be honest and
[29:31] and so that's really really powerful you
[29:33] lived in like a lot of different
[29:35] countries you lived in in China you
[29:37] lived in Dubai in America you lived in
[29:40] in many different places where freedom
[29:43] is also on a different kind of level I
[29:46] would say how did China Dubai America
[29:51] the the contrast between those countries
[29:54] also um change a view on on freedom or
[29:58] form your view on on freedom in
[30:01] general yeah
[30:04] um the contrast was
[30:07] definitely very educational when so I
[30:12] was in China at the end of my career I
[30:14] had spent the most amount of time in
[30:16] China right before I came back to the
[30:18] United States and obviously in China
[30:22] there's a lot of
[30:24] censorship
[30:26] but they're
[30:28] very uh out in the open about their
[30:31] censorship you know you can't get on a
[30:33] computer and go to Google something you
[30:36] can't access Google you can't criticize
[30:39] the
[30:39] government it is what is it it is it's a
[30:42] fact and the thing that was most
[30:46] striking to me was coming back to the
[30:48] United States in
[30:51] 2018 and seeing how much of our freedoms
[30:54] had been
[30:56] restricted and how unaware everyone
[31:00] was about that and that contrast was the
[31:05] thing that I got stuck on um and I'm
[31:09] still stuck on it and back in 2018
[31:13] 2019 people really thought I was crazy
[31:16] because I W I was saying you know in a
[31:19] way the sensorship here in the United
[31:22] States is worse because I don't know
[31:25] what I'm allowed to say and what I'm not
[31:27] have to say like you know what if I
[31:31] think some of the things Trump has done
[31:34] are good like can I say that who who is
[31:37] GNA not be my friend because I say that
[31:39] you know I I was in Shanghai at a dinner
[31:43] um with a bunch of of colleagues and
[31:46] this CH uh this gentleman said to me you
[31:49] must be so proud of the this businessman
[31:54] he gives up his whole life to represent
[31:56] you and your country and I thought
[31:59] that's a
[32:00] really
[32:01] um it's a really unique and honest view
[32:06] of trump and whether I agree with that
[32:09] or not it's it's hard to argue that
[32:11] right like he did do that um and I was
[32:16] trying to have these conversations with
[32:18] people here in the US and nobody would
[32:20] speak to me I mean people were just like
[32:23] you you can't ask me that I'm not going
[32:25] to tell you what I think like you're
[32:27] going to get me fired my wife is going
[32:29] to leave me you know oh my husband my
[32:32] husband will yell at me like I was
[32:35] like am I in the United States like and
[32:39] I you know very quickly I got to the
[32:41] point where I was like look I don't care
[32:43] if you love him I don't care if you hate
[32:45] him but like please someone speak to me
[32:48] you know like since when can we not just
[32:50] have a
[32:51] conversation um a and of course Trump is
[32:55] like the hot you know the big ticket
[32:57] item but that kind of like triggered
[33:00] something in my brain and I started
[33:02] watching other things and there were so
[33:05] many other things that everyone was too
[33:07] scared to be honest about um you know
[33:11] you have the transgender movement you
[33:15] have you have a lot of things um you
[33:18] know Free Speech itself and the fact
[33:21] that governments are trying to make you
[33:24] know hate speech illegal I know there
[33:26] are a lot of countries
[33:27] in Europe where this is sort of further
[33:30] down the path than here officially in
[33:32] the United States
[33:34] um but I I would bring this up and I
[33:37] would say well you know what do you
[33:40] think about hate speech like should hate
[33:42] speech be illegal so there was just this
[33:44] really long list of things that nobody
[33:46] would talk to me about and it was so
[33:49] jarring to me because I had just come
[33:53] from China where you have to watch
[33:55] everything you say right
[33:59] um and I I didn't expect to come back to
[34:02] the United States and for it to be the
[34:06] same again sort of worse because no one
[34:10] would admit that they were living like
[34:12] this like I I was
[34:15] like you guys are too scared to talk to
[34:17] me about the president you know like you
[34:21] can tell me you hate him you can tell me
[34:23] you love him I don't care I love you
[34:26] either like
[34:27] and and people were too scared to give
[34:29] me their opinion it just I I'm still
[34:33] processing it I mean it it's something
[34:35] that I still have a hard time with so
[34:38] there were some really lonely years that
[34:40] I had and then when covid
[34:44] came a lot of people woke up and I got a
[34:47] lot less like you're completely nuts and
[34:50] a lot more like oh wow maybe the
[34:53] government is capable of doing that
[34:55] maybe they are really doing that you
[34:57] know what did what did you say before
[35:00] about you know governments doing this or
[35:02] that so people were more willing to talk
[35:04] to me but still it's there's still a lot
[35:07] of people who refuse to have a lot of
[35:11] conversations um yeah nobody thought
[35:13] they will completely shut down the
[35:15] country this took everybody by surprise
[35:18] I think yeah yeah exactly so it you know
[35:23] those experiences informed you know my
[35:26] views and thoughts and opinions on
[35:28] freedom very dramatically um I find
[35:31] myself missing Dubai a lot it was very
[35:33] safe um and I spent a lot of time
[35:37] thinking like what is it about Dubai and
[35:41] I I kind of come to the same conclusion
[35:44] which is that in Dubai the rules and the
[35:48] restrictions are very clear um I
[35:51] wouldn't do drugs in Dubai Dubai has a
[35:54] very hard line on drugs and so it's not
[35:57] a place that you go and do drugs you
[36:00] know you don't commit crimes in the UAE
[36:04] um and if you're someone that wants to
[36:07] live dishonestly and be a criminal it's
[36:11] not a good place for you uh but if
[36:13] you're someone that wants to live an
[36:15] honest life and you're not really
[36:17] concerned about committing
[36:19] crimes it's a it's a nice place to be I
[36:23] mean I I would go to dinner or lunch and
[36:25] leave my purse sitting alone on a table
[36:29] um you know you come back and and there
[36:32] it is and and people will say yeah but
[36:35] you know democracy and they're very
[36:37] harsh if you do break the law and these
[36:39] kinds of things and it it makes me think
[36:43] a lot you know there there are tradeoffs
[36:47] but I don't know it's tough I I I hear a
[36:50] lot that Dubai is one of the safest
[36:52] place because you can just go out and
[36:54] open and do stuff like you can leave
[36:59] expensive stuff out nobody takes it and
[37:02] this is kind of an advantage of having
[37:05] an let's say brutal government that has
[37:08] a really strict rules um but if you can
[37:13] like as Salvador for example a lot of I
[37:16] hear a lot of people saying oh the
[37:17] president is so brutal to the gangs and
[37:20] everything he he did also got some
[37:23] innocent people like of course they had
[37:25] the highest murder rate in the whole
[37:28] world if if I'm the president of a
[37:30] country that has the highest murder rate
[37:33] in the whole world of course I'm going
[37:36] to do something about it and of course
[37:37] it will be a brutal action you will you
[37:41] will get some innocent people probably
[37:44] at first then of course after the post
[37:48] uh post brutal action you can get some
[37:51] innocent people again out but I heard
[37:53] some stories where a father says okay
[37:56] finally
[37:57] I feel good about leaving my daughter
[38:00] out in in the middle of the day she she
[38:03] would never go out in the middle of the
[38:05] day without me now I can let her out
[38:07] because elavo is safe again so that's an
[38:11] interesting uh development in Sal
[38:13] Salvador with a Bitcoin standard even
[38:16] though uh how politics think about
[38:20] ruling with uh gangs is not something
[38:25] that stands in the bit protocol but
[38:27] somehow it relates to that I think it's
[38:30] interesting to see it is it is really
[38:33] interesting and I I found myself
[38:36] thinking about this a lot I had the
[38:38] opportunity to visit El Salvador in
[38:40] November and it was very safe um and of
[38:44] course prior to being there you have the
[38:46] the action by buelli that you that you
[38:49] mentioned like the Roundup of the gangs
[38:53] and I you know I listened to the speech
[38:56] that he gave before they went and did
[38:58] that and I thought it was really
[39:02] inspiring and I you know I tend to agree
[39:06] with the things that he said um you know
[39:09] that El Salvador and and other countries
[39:11] that were that are going to move up in
[39:16] the world uh you know economically
[39:18] geopolitically they are countries that
[39:20] are going back to morality and rule of
[39:24] law and conversely you have country
[39:26] countries um like the United States
[39:29] depending on your opinions uh you know
[39:31] some a lot of the countries in Western
[39:33] Europe that have abandoned morality and
[39:36] therefore they're going downwards
[39:38] they're getting less safe they're
[39:41] getting less economically Advanced um I
[39:45] think it's really hard to argue with
[39:47] that and of course there is this
[39:48] criticism that oh he's a you know he's a
[39:51] brutal dictator um but unless you have
[39:56] lived you know under gang rule where
[40:00] it's not safe to go out in the middle of
[40:02] the day where you can't run a business
[40:05] because you're being extorted you know
[40:07] by gangs it's really hard to say um you
[40:12] know it's a unique thought experiment
[40:16] for me because having been in Dubai and
[40:18] and having experienced living in a place
[40:21] that is so safe um I realize that this
[40:24] is something that is priority for me and
[40:28] that perhaps you
[40:31] know I don't know it's it's tough but I
[40:35] I think the people that are criticizing
[40:37] what's happening in El Salvador are
[40:40] perhaps needing to um experience more of
[40:44] the
[40:45] world yes and I I want to come back to
[40:49] one thing you said earlier about the
[40:51] bitcoiners being um respective of
[40:55] opinions and not being scared of saying
[40:59] what they want to say and I always have
[41:03] this one amazing example in my head
[41:05] where I was at a Bitcoin Meetup and
[41:07] there was uh left to me like in front of
[41:10] me there about two people sitting and uh
[41:13] the guy left to me uh was a an carnivore
[41:17] like completely just on meat like not
[41:20] even just eating everything normal
[41:23] behavior example just eating meat and on
[41:26] the right side there was a raw
[41:28] wing and I I just loved that
[41:31] conversation so much because it was such
[41:34] an honest respecting and even loving um
[41:39] conversation between two people that
[41:41] have about one specific topic a
[41:44] completely different completely
[41:46] different uh mindset and then and I
[41:49] found that they are actually finding
[41:52] common ground they're like oh we don't
[41:54] want processed food we want fresh fresh
[41:56] food like there's a lot of a lot of
[41:58] things they said that was completely the
[42:01] same thing actually and uh only okay
[42:06] they eating completely raw vegan and
[42:08] they only meat uh so the end product was
[42:10] completely different but I love that
[42:12] experience and I think it's more and
[42:14] more with the Bitcoin community and I
[42:17] I'm always thinking about how will that
[42:20] maybe when Bitcoin gets to a point where
[42:23] this Mass adopted how can that change
[42:27] the whole world and the living together
[42:30] in like the next 20
[42:32] 40 like let's say 120 years what's
[42:36] what's your thoughts on
[42:38] this I I couldn't agree with you more I
[42:41] I have found bitcoiners to be very
[42:43] honest and respectful and willing to you
[42:47] know share their opinions with you and
[42:49] so I love that um I I hope that and I I
[42:55] do
[42:56] believe that as
[42:59] we convert to a Bitcoin standard that
[43:03] there will be a return to um values you
[43:07] know people will be more honest we see
[43:10] all of
[43:11] the corruption and just
[43:15] terrible behavior that Fiat incentives
[43:18] have enabled and and kind of created
[43:22] whether it's by Design or you know it's
[43:25] just a result of the way that everything
[43:28] is structured and so I see Bitcoin as
[43:31] the antidote to that and returning to a
[43:35] society where you have value in exchange
[43:37] for Value instead of
[43:40] just nonproductive people everywhere you
[43:44] know earning numbers on a screen and
[43:47] math that's happening in Banks and and
[43:50] all of that I think um you know a
[43:53] Bitcoin standard in a on a Bitcoin
[43:55] standard you have you have to provide
[43:58] actual value something of value in
[44:01] exchange for value and that that alone
[44:05] drives a different incentive um and it
[44:09] rewards differently
[44:12] so it creeps throughout Society I don't
[44:17] know if you've ever heard the
[44:20] expression politics is Downstream from
[44:24] culture yeah but you have heard that um
[44:28] so I I believe that and I think Bitcoin
[44:31] will help fix the rot that's happening
[44:35] culturally and if we can fix that and
[44:38] fix the culture and return us to society
[44:42] that you know values upward Mobility
[44:46] values success and
[44:49] values creating things of value um that
[44:54] that will trickle down to politics and
[44:57] then to your you know laws rules
[45:00] regulations and the way that they're
[45:02] implemented and so I see it really being
[45:05] a driver of a Resurgence um you know
[45:09] I've heard people say there's a
[45:11] Renaissance happening in El Salvador a
[45:14] return to this type of society and I
[45:17] hope that Bitcoin can do that for many
[45:20] other countries around the world um
[45:23] which countries
[45:24] will adopt that and allow for those
[45:27] changes to proliferate I don't know um I
[45:33] can take a guess which countries are
[45:35] open to it and which aren't um but I
[45:37] think that we will see a lot of the
[45:40] world follow in El Salvador's footsteps
[45:43] and I'm really optimistic about the
[45:46] after effects of that all that's that's
[45:50] a beautiful thing that uh hopefully
[45:54] happens in that way and
[45:56] I'm I'm really optimistic like I'm from
[45:59] a type of person always a really
[46:01] optimistic guy and uh I see that this
[46:06] optimism and this hope uh Bitcoin also
[46:09] gives more people um I have I just
[46:13] thought about one thing um when you
[46:15] think about
[46:17] bitcoiners what are the qualities or the
[46:20] properties of a bitcoiner that are the
[46:23] same with every bitcoiner or is
[46:26] something like that
[46:29] even
[46:31] um I find that bitcoiners to me it all
[46:36] goes back to the honesty bitcoiners are
[46:38] willing to be
[46:40] honest
[46:42] um
[46:44] and
[46:46] respectful you know there of course as
[46:49] Bitcoin interest and adoption grows
[46:52] we're going to have bad eggs you know
[46:55] Bitcoin is not going
[46:57] to get rid of bad people unfortunately
[47:00] we're still going to have bad people but
[47:03] we we're still early and I am enjoying
[47:06] being early because you do see many of
[47:09] these things in common amongst
[47:11] bitcoiners and and people that have
[47:13] adopted Bitcoin into their lives um
[47:17] again just the the willingness to be
[47:20] honest and respectful of other people's
[47:23] opinions um whether they agree agree or
[47:26] don't agree you know I think it was not
[47:28] so long
[47:30] ago that we lived in a world where it
[47:32] was fine to disagree about a lot of
[47:35] things and so that's the thing that I
[47:37] love most about bitcoiners is nobody's
[47:40] afraid to offend you because they're
[47:43] opinion Dippers because they know that
[47:44] they're going to have respect you know
[47:47] it goes both
[47:48] ways that's great um for you personally
[47:53] what are you now doing in Bitcoin and
[47:56] what are your like next steps what what
[47:59] do you want to contribute to the Bitcoin
[48:01] Community sure so I am doing product
[48:05] development right now uh I work for one
[48:09] of the original ATM companies here in
[48:12] Florida in the United States company
[48:14] called bite Federal um I am working on
[48:19] orange pilling everyone so that we can
[48:21] take the entire company Bitcoin only uh
[48:24] right now I am managing the launch of
[48:27] our Merchant point of sale product and
[48:30] that product is is primarily a Bitcoin
[48:33] product um we are looking at opening an
[48:36] office down in El Salvador and we are
[48:39] also going to be expanding into Dubai so
[48:42] those are sort of the the top priorities
[48:44] for
[48:45] 2024 I'm really excited about that
[48:50] um and you know I think going to new
[48:56] conferences I went to all the US
[48:59] conferences this past year and I'm
[49:02] looking next year at going to probably
[49:05] madira um Prague Prague is very
[49:09] recommended yeah and I'm I'm most
[49:12] excited about that I'm I'm super that's
[49:14] like number one on my list actually uh I
[49:17] went you know in November to adopting
[49:19] Bitcoin down in El Salvador and I'm
[49:21] hoping to attend that again so I think
[49:23] for me really expanding
[49:26] um I think I've met like all the
[49:28] American bitcoiners and I I love them
[49:31] all uh but I I'm looking to get outside
[49:34] the United States uh and so that that's
[49:39] my priority for next year is
[49:41] non-american bitcoiners and non-american
[49:44] Bitcoin conferences as an Austrian I
[49:47] think this is a great
[49:49] [Laughter]
[49:51] priority I introduced today actually a
[49:53] new Andro team to the podcast or like
[49:55] like a slightly changed end routine to
[49:57] the podcast till now I had the end
[50:00] routine where the previous guest asked
[50:02] the next guest a question okay and I
[50:05] will keep that but I always forget to
[50:08] ask the guest what question do you want
[50:11] for the next guest so I was like let's
[50:13] introduce it directly in the podcast so
[50:16] I cannot forget it uh so I will ask you
[50:19] now for a question that uh first for me
[50:24] and but also Al then for the next guest
[50:27] like what questions do you have for me
[50:29] and for the next guest uh that will be
[50:32] on the show without knowing what's the
[50:34] next guest
[50:35] is okay so my question would
[50:40] be I am you know working in product
[50:43] development and so we are looking very
[50:46] heavily at um Layer Two and layer three
[50:51] solutions like lightning of course you
[50:54] know I think we're entering a new phase
[50:55] phas of Bitcoin where um transacting on
[51:00] the base layer it has become expensive I
[51:03] I I don't think that that's really going
[51:04] to reverse I think as we move forward
[51:07] it's a reality that we have to accept
[51:08] and adapt to yes so my question would be
[51:13] if you could have one product
[51:19] solution what would it be like what is
[51:22] the tool that you would most like to see
[51:26] built in Bitcoin to help solve these
[51:29] Solutions uh or these problems um and
[51:33] and maybe we can build this I think the
[51:36] biggest problem Bitcoin is solving is
[51:38] the store value problem uh but it it
[51:41] does that really good right now it do it
[51:44] it's it's the best best asset to do that
[51:48] um
[51:49] what there are a lot of uh things that
[51:53] can happen on the L two layer three
[51:56] maybe layer four on top of Bitcoin but
[51:59] the one thing that we have to nail is
[52:02] being an
[52:04] amazing uh payment Network and Bitcoin
[52:09] as a base layer has the perfect um
[52:13] foundation for that and I think this is
[52:16] the perfect Foundation to build on that
[52:18] but we have to nail that it's the best
[52:20] payment Network that there are the best
[52:22] apps on that uh custodia or non-
[52:26] custodian like it's it just has to be an
[52:28] amazing experience for everybody uh to
[52:31] show people hey see there's a Bitcoin
[52:34] let's transfer like I always like to
[52:37] show people with lightning wallets uh
[52:41] Let It Be wallet of Satoshi even because
[52:43] then it's easier for them they don't
[52:45] even have them to log in and they just
[52:47] can experience it I like the the the
[52:51] shining in the eyee when I sent them a
[52:54] few Sates because it's just so instant
[52:57] and quick and it's it's I know that
[52:59] there are a lot more developments in
[53:00] Bitcoin but honestly I only care about
[53:03] the payments I I I I think we nail the
[53:07] store of value it will take a while did
[53:10] everybody um notice the store of value
[53:13] and and notice that Bitcoin is the best
[53:15] place to put your financial energy um
[53:18] but we also have to nail the payment
[53:22] side the medium of exchange because only
[53:24] then if we actually used for payments we
[53:26] can also move to a unit of account and I
[53:29] I I love I it has to be like Bitcoin has
[53:34] to be the base layer of our financial
[53:37] system and then it also has to be the
[53:40] unit of account of everything the maybe
[53:43] satosi and maybe we have to go one step
[53:46] deeper with I don't know Nakamoto or
[53:48] bits or whatever we call it um because
[53:52] when Bitcoin is adopted for the whole
[53:54] world I think uh even one satosi would
[53:56] be not enough not small enough um so
[54:00] this would be my answer because we we
[54:02] just have to nail it there there are a
[54:04] lot of things happening I know
[54:05] Innovations but this is like I'm a
[54:09] really basic guy I want to I want to
[54:12] have to fix and nail the basics and then
[54:14] we can do all the fancy
[54:17] stuff I agree I think that's super
[54:20] important um and we're we are right at
[54:24] that moment in time
[54:25] where this is the problem that we need
[54:28] to solve I couldn't agree with you more
[54:30] we have nailed the um you know the
[54:34] savings technology and we are moving
[54:37] into um a payment Network so you know
[54:41] there there are solutions out there but
[54:44] I think there need to be better
[54:45] Solutions and as you said it has to be
[54:48] very very easy um we talked a lot in the
[54:51] beginning about like how far behind
[54:54] people outside side of Bitcoin are are
[54:56] you know are no coiners in our life um
[55:00] and not everyone is going to take the
[55:03] time that we are all taking to learn the
[55:06] ins and outs and the complexities and
[55:09] you know using all of these different
[55:11] wallets so I agree with you that super
[55:13] Super Simple Solutions to enable
[55:16] payments are majorly important they're
[55:19] they're probably the most important
[55:21] thing right now for us to to get figured
[55:24] out and build and simplified
[55:28] yeah then we have still the question for
[55:31] them from the previous guest to
[55:34] you and I like this kind of questions
[55:36] the most because the Bri guest actually
[55:39] has
[55:40] no does not know you at all like no does
[55:44] not know who who will be the receiving
[55:47] end on of that question um the question
[55:50] is when will Real Estate Investors start
[55:52] to cycle Capital into Bitcoin or over
[55:55] real estate and what impact will that
[55:57] have on the price and you can guess from
[56:01] the question that it was uh someone that
[56:04] started with real estate came into
[56:06] equity and then moved to to bitcoin
[56:09] that's a great question um I think we
[56:13] are starting to see just the very
[56:16] beginning of this happening I don't know
[56:19] what's happening you know in Europe but
[56:22] we are starting to see here in the
[56:24] United States
[56:25] a lot of people who are invested in real
[56:30] estate
[56:31] um The Tide is kind of turning where for
[56:35] many many years it was just you know
[56:38] accepted as common knowledge that buying
[56:41] real estate was a good way to make money
[56:45] and I think as things are
[56:47] changing um we're seeing that that's not
[56:50] always the case and in fact in some
[56:53] cases it might be very wrong
[56:55] with that you're not really making money
[56:57] that you're losing money
[57:00] um so I'm starting to see more of those
[57:03] conversations you know comparisons
[57:05] between owning real estate and property
[57:07] whether it's incom producing or not and
[57:10] just holding Bitcoin and which of those
[57:13] is going to make more sense for you um
[57:16] and and more often than not it is just
[57:18] holding
[57:19] Bitcoin so I think you asked when we
[57:23] will see will we see and if so when um I
[57:27] think we will absolutely see that I
[57:31] think
[57:33] um it's going to take time we're still
[57:35] really early in Bitcoin and so for for
[57:39] people to come to that understanding is
[57:42] going to take some time but people who
[57:45] are looking at at buying and holding
[57:47] real estate of course the ones that are
[57:48] educated on it tend I think to do a lot
[57:51] of research and Analysis and so that's
[57:54] why we're starting to see them say wait
[57:56] a second you know let me look at my cost
[57:59] and the turnover of of income producing
[58:03] real estate and all of these sort of
[58:06] different layers and complexities where
[58:10] each of those different factors you know
[58:12] leave a lot of room for error or
[58:15] miscalculations or something just to go
[58:17] wrong and on the flip side you have
[58:20] owning Bitcoin which is very easy you
[58:23] know you don't have to pay for
[58:24] maintenance you don't have to deal with
[58:26] tenants or any of these things you don't
[58:28] have to deal with taxes going up or
[58:31] insurance rates all kinds of unknown
[58:35] factors so I think we'll see a lot of
[58:37] people moving money from Real Estate
[58:40] into
[58:41] Bitcoin and there are a lot of charts
[58:43] out there predicting the impact that
[58:44] that could have on price if you just
[58:46] take you know total allocation into real
[58:49] estate and take a certain percentage
[58:51] that percentage of that and put it into
[58:54] Bitcoin
[58:55] and I think that easily you know I think
[58:57] we're going to see six figure US dollar
[59:01] valuation of Bitcoin soon
[59:04] and maybe not this cycle but probably by
[59:07] the next cycle I think that'll kind of
[59:10] be the base at least who who knows
[59:14] really that's a hard thing to predict
[59:16] you know but um as timing of it yeah um
[59:21] as entire Industries move a certain
[59:24] percentage of their economies into
[59:27] Bitcoin it's obviously going to have an
[59:30] exponential impact on the price yeah and
[59:33] real estate is right now I think misused
[59:35] as a store of value yeah because it's
[59:38] just not it's a business has to be
[59:41] profitable it's just like a stock like a
[59:43] I find it so funny when people say like
[59:45] oh I want to uh have real estate to to
[59:48] save my money I'm like how can housing
[59:52] be money that that's a fear thing right
[59:57] right but you know this is kind of one
[59:59] of the things that we like talked about
[60:02] that you have to unlearn because
[60:04] everyone is just taught that like that
[60:06] real estate is a good store of value um
[60:11] so you know it's wild how much there is
[60:14] to unlearn from Fiat world yeah it's
[60:17] it's actually wild so where do you want
[60:21] to where where do you want to point
[60:24] people at where can they uh reach you
[60:26] the best I am just on
[60:29] Twitter so they can you can find me on
[60:32] Twitter I am fully doxed um it's my name
[60:38] and I will not DM
[60:41] you unfortunately I had a lot of fake
[60:43] accounts one of the one of my fake
[60:46] impersonator accounts actually DMD my
[60:50] boss um and he came to me and said is
[60:53] this you
[60:55] my God so I guess some of them are quite
[60:58] sophisticated
[61:00] um I answer a lot of my DMs but I I
[61:03] don't really DM someone especially if I
[61:04] don't know them so I'm on Twitter and I
[61:08] I have a a blue check mark so you know
[61:11] follow the real
[61:12] account it's it's crazy and I started to
[61:16] see fake accounts with I think even
[61:19] before thousand followers it's really
[61:22] it's it was really soon for me and now I
[61:25] have 7,000 and I started to not care now
[61:32] right just yeah there there's nothing
[61:34] you can really do yeah it's it's I get
[61:37] once a week a message oh did you know he
[61:39] is a scammer and I'm like I did not know
[61:41] about him but I really don't care at
[61:43] this point it's it's it's a it's a it's
[61:45] an ax platform mistake and they will
[61:48] they will try to fix it it's a hard
[61:50] problem to get rid of because when so
[61:52] many small accounts have all the spot
[61:54] problems of course uh how how can they
[61:58] like they don't have an army of people
[61:59] that doing all every day oh is this a
[62:02] kind the real one is like right yeah I'm
[62:06] hoping they they fix it but like you
[62:09] said there there's nothing really for
[62:11] now that can be done it's kind of an
[62:15] inevitable I find that it comes in waves
[62:17] like I'll get a whole bunch of them and
[62:20] then you know they get purged and you
[62:22] get a little bit of time and then you
[62:23] start getting them messages again like
[62:25] oh here's a fake one and I also see the
[62:28] followers I think they are having days
[62:31] or even hours where they are deleting a
[62:33] lot of bots it's not like it's like
[62:35] suddenly and I have sometimes but
[62:38] usually I grow with like 10 to 20
[62:40] followers a day so it's like when I see
[62:43] it's like oh a little bit came to came
[62:45] here but sometime it's like a day when
[62:47] nothing really happened like there's not
[62:49] a [ __ ] storm or something and there like
[62:51] 100 followers
[62:52] less so I think this is just because
[62:55] they're getting rid of followers I see
[62:57] that
[62:58] sometimes yeah I have noticed that it um
[63:02] it's interesting but you know there's
[63:05] there's a lot of love and there's a lot
[63:07] of hate for for ex I'm I still have
[63:11] Twitter in my brain it's hard to change
[63:15] that but I I'm really thankful for it
[63:18] you know I've been able to connect with
[63:19] bitcoiners all over the world uh like
[63:22] you and I'm I'm so thankful for that so
[63:26] I hope that they continue to improve
[63:29] some of these things but it is what it
[63:32] is it is the platform where every
[63:34] Bitcoin is I think like I asked every
[63:36] person I interviewed where they are and
[63:38] they all say x and some say xent YouTube
[63:43] okay yeah it makes sense it seems to be
[63:45] the Town Square thank you for being on
[63:48] thank you for having me it was great
[63:50] talking with you
