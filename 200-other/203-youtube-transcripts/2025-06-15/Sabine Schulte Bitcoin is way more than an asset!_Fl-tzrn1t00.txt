[00:00] it shouldn't be a religion yet money
[00:02] favors the people that are already rich
[00:04] there's much more to it than I than I
[00:06] initially thought um and it's not just
[00:08] an asset it's much more than that only
[00:10] 2% of Bitcoin hlas actually have a
[00:12] harder wallet it's really never too late
[00:15] and the best time is now
[00:17] [Music]
[00:20] always I even get into Bitcoin in the
[00:23] first
[00:24] place well in the first place um it sort
[00:27] of happened by accident I would say
[00:29] because was um I was not into finances
[00:32] yet I was it was in
[00:34] 2016 and someone suggested to invest
[00:38] into a project that at the time I didn't
[00:41] know that it was a Ponzi scheme and it
[00:43] was a scam but at the time I didn't know
[00:46] so um I trusted the person who suggested
[00:49] that and you know the project had been
[00:51] running for a while and it all looked
[00:53] good and stuff like that and but you you
[00:55] could only pay with Bitcoin right so in
[00:58] 2016 I got myself um I bought Bitcoin on
[01:02] an exchange and
[01:05] um you know I transferred I I bought
[01:08] Bitcoin and I transferred the money
[01:10] directly because the volatility was
[01:12] pretty high then um so I was always
[01:16] eager to to transfer the Bitcoin that I
[01:18] just bought as quickly as possible into
[01:20] this system that I believed was a good
[01:23] thing so uh and I didn't understand any
[01:27] anything about Bitcoin at the time I
[01:29] just knew okay if I wanted to be part of
[01:31] this project I needed to buy Bitcoin and
[01:33] send it there so I did and it didn't
[01:37] last very it lasted for a year and a
[01:39] half the project you know and I kept on
[01:42] buying Bitcoin and sending Bitcoin to
[01:45] the into the system um and then the
[01:48] whole thing imploded at some point in
[01:51] 2018 and I lost it all and um you know I
[01:56] can see all the transactions and if I
[01:58] look at all the money that I I sent
[02:00] through the system right if I just held
[02:03] all of the Bitcoin that I bought at the
[02:05] time in 2016 until
[02:07] 2018 wow that would have been really
[02:10] interesting today right so but I didn't
[02:13] I lost it all and um but the thing was
[02:17] and that was the interesting part for me
[02:19] um looking back at it is that I did have
[02:22] Bitcoin on a on an exchange I knew how
[02:24] to to buy it and um in the meantime I
[02:28] also studied stuff about Fin
[02:30] and and Investments and so
[02:33] um still I didn't understand Bitcoin at
[02:37] the time in 2018 either um but I I I
[02:41] looked at it as an asset because I
[02:43] started investing in general and uh so I
[02:46] figured out you know it could be part of
[02:48] my portfolio so I started investing in
[02:50] Bitcoin as such as an asset um I did not
[02:55] comprehend too much about it um I just
[02:57] and I also did like at the time I played
[03:00] with altcoins and stuff I did all kinds
[03:03] of stuff um
[03:05] so and then
[03:07] 20121 um that was like an all-time high
[03:10] at the time um I took my what I invested
[03:14] I took it out because my portfolio was
[03:17] was like out of balance so like in the
[03:20] sense of you know having like a balanced
[03:22] portfolio um Bitcoin seem to to be too
[03:26] high
[03:27] so so you know look looking back at it
[03:30] today it's like oh my God why did you do
[03:33] that but I did right because I didn't
[03:36] understand anything about Bitcoin at the
[03:38] time um it was just an investment it was
[03:41] just an asset it was just you know and
[03:43] also it was a volatile investment and
[03:45] you know was it felt like a high-risk
[03:48] thing that I was doing so I was trying
[03:50] to not you know be all in you know get
[03:53] get all in into Bitcoin so over time
[03:56] though um
[03:58] I I started learning more about Bitcoin
[04:02] and it's it's only at the end of 23 that
[04:05] I I went to insbrook to the Bitcoin
[04:06] conference that was my first Bitcoin
[04:08] conference that I attended I was there
[04:11] as a photographer actually and um that
[04:14] was the first time I
[04:17] realized the community you know what the
[04:20] community stands for what Bitcoin
[04:22] actually means that was the first time I
[04:24] was really able to comprehend to some
[04:28] extent I wouldn't say I comprehend
[04:30] Bitcoin
[04:32] like in depth I wouldn't say that um but
[04:36] I realized that this is it's about
[04:38] Freedom it's about decentralized Finance
[04:41] it's about um something revolutionary
[04:44] actually that we we never had before and
[04:48] that the community is is
[04:51] about Innovation about sustainability
[04:55] about all values that I that are
[04:58] important to me so um at that point I
[05:01] realized okay um it's
[05:05] really there's much more to it than I
[05:07] than I initially thought um and it's not
[05:09] just an asset it's much more than that
[05:12] so yeah since then it's it's only the
[05:14] end of last year since then I'm like I'm
[05:17] down the the rabbit
[05:19] hole and uh I gave up all like
[05:24] everything else that I was doing like
[05:26] you know I think in 23 I still I was
[05:28] still holding some ethereum so I I
[05:32] changed all of that and uh it's Bitcoin
[05:35] only now so yeah and um yeah that's it
[05:40] for for for now that's really
[05:42] interesting um like first of all the
[05:44] spams and the scams that you mentioned
[05:46] in the beginning I think it wasn't the
[05:49] same
[05:50] one I I almost wasn't the same one I did
[05:53] not actually enter which was which isn't
[05:56] surprising because I'm I'm really I'm
[05:58] always a person that believes like like
[05:59] I'm believing in a good in people and
[06:01] trusting people a lot like I it takes a
[06:03] while so I don't trust people I I
[06:06] initially always have to trust in people
[06:07] and not to don't trust people but for
[06:10] some reason it did not feel good uh for
[06:12] me so I did not get in but I was at
[06:14] those meetings and I also talk with niik
[06:16] the the biggest German podcast about
[06:18] that on his podcast when I was a guest
[06:20] um and a lot of people went on the
[06:22] scamps in this in the SPs like a lot of
[06:24] people from 2016 to 2018 it was like you
[06:27] get in you see all some maybe some
[06:30] friends in there it always starts with
[06:32] like some older friend of yours comes to
[06:35] you and says like oh I have this
[06:36] business opportunity investment
[06:37] opportunity or something like that you
[06:39] go on a coffee there like five more
[06:40] people um then you have to lock up your
[06:43] I think it was half a year or something
[06:45] like that the money I don't know if it's
[06:46] the same one but it it sounds similar uh
[06:49] and so many people were in this and yeah
[06:52] it got it got a Bitcoin got a bad repap
[06:55] about because of that because then uh
[06:57] they connected Bitcoin with actual buid
[07:00] scheme of actual multi-level marketing
[07:02] schemes which it is not and then they
[07:05] also like I never talked about that on
[07:07] the podcast and I want to do it today um
[07:09] there are so many scams out there like
[07:12] there are on
[07:14] Twitter 200 other Robin sers that are
[07:17] containg all my followers and do uh and
[07:20] want to uh get them into some course
[07:23] into some WhatsApp group and something
[07:25] God I will never contact anyone to get
[07:28] into any group at all all and this is
[07:30] always a scam I mean I have a telegram
[07:32] group for channel members but this is
[07:34] like featured directly on YouTube on on
[07:36] my Channel with with my community that's
[07:38] the only thing that I'm offering because
[07:41] I want to get my channel members
[07:42] together and so they have a group they
[07:44] can exchange thoughts and stuff like
[07:46] that but even my cousin went into uh
[07:51] almost into a scam and my cousin is like
[07:55] 12 years old and he uh got contacted by
[07:59] scammer of mine in English and he is
[08:01] obviously from Austria he doesn't know
[08:03] English that well and he exchanged with
[08:06] my scammer that you use my profile
[08:08] picture and my name and like 20 messages
[08:12] and he was really almost like investing
[08:14] but he has no money so it was it
[08:17] was it was good in a sense uh and then
[08:22] he was writing me hey on what hey why
[08:24] are you uh talking to me in English and
[08:27] I'm like I'm what are you saying I'm not
[08:29] talking to you in English so like even
[08:32] people that know you kind of because
[08:35] they're not
[08:36] stupid those cams if someone Falls for
[08:38] that um they are doing it in a really
[08:41] intelligent way so uh just like a public
[08:44] service announcement there are a lot of
[08:45] scams out there be aware uh see if the
[08:48] account that you are interacting with is
[08:50] actually the account that you think
[08:52] you're interacting with and then
[08:54] consider even if it's the real account
[08:56] this real account might be hacked so it
[08:59] might might not be the actual person I
[09:01] just want to get this out of the way um
[09:03] but you said something interesting that
[09:04] you didn't understand um Bitcoin at the
[09:07] time did you understand money at the
[09:10] time because I think a lot of people
[09:11] even michor said it um learn with
[09:14] Bitcoin what money actually is and
[09:17] that's why a lot of people actually
[09:18] don't understand what Bitcoin is true
[09:21] that was true for me too I didn't
[09:23] understand anything about money I
[09:24] wouldn't I don't think I would have
[09:25] gotten into this scam if I had some
[09:28] knowledge about money and how it works
[09:30] and stuff so I had no idea about nothing
[09:32] at the time right I I I just didn't so I
[09:36] just trusted the guy so yeah no um no I
[09:40] mean that was a that that was a another
[09:42] Journey for me to uh to really um get
[09:46] into into the question of what is money
[09:50] and also here I wouldn't say that I have
[09:53] like total indepth knowledge but um
[09:57] first of all it for me it was a lot
[09:58] about mindset about you know limiting
[10:01] beliefs um around money because I never
[10:03] dealt with money you know I was employed
[10:05] for most of my life you know raising the
[10:08] family raising the kids making sure
[10:09] everything is secure blah blah blah the
[10:11] you know the the normal stuff and um so
[10:15] I never I I never wanted to have
[10:17] anything to do with money really it was
[10:19] really it's a very German thing I don't
[10:21] know about the austrians but it's a it's
[10:23] a very German thing like limiting
[10:26] beliefs like money is dirty and you know
[10:29] Rich are the others and the rich ones
[10:31] are taking advantage of other people
[10:33] blah blah blah you know all these all
[10:35] these very limiting beliefs that we have
[10:37] as an individual also as a culture as a
[10:40] as a society so um money is in Germany
[10:44] is not really looked at in a positive
[10:48] way uh unlike in the in the US for
[10:51] example you know it's uh you know I have
[10:53] this example that um when when you see
[10:56] like a big car like a Ferrari at the at
[11:00] the gas station in Germany you know
[11:01] people would be like envious and and
[11:04] hide it and then just feel like this is
[11:07] this must be a weird person you know
[11:08] this month he must have he must have
[11:10] ripped off people to get that kind of
[11:12] car if you if you do that in the US you
[11:14] know people would come up to you and say
[11:16] really nice car how did you
[11:19] manage so really that's that's the
[11:22] that's one of the differences and money
[11:23] is not bad as such right so here I in
[11:26] Germany I feel money is looked at as a
[11:28] bad thing
[11:30] um especially um if you don't have
[11:33] it then you look at other people and you
[11:36] know feel like they're bad people
[11:37] because they have more or something it's
[11:39] this Envy thing is really strong in
[11:42] Germany so yeah looking into that and
[11:45] learning about my own limiting beliefs
[11:47] and learning how to how to deal with
[11:50] money differently and how to actually
[11:52] also you know learn about finances and
[11:55] learn how to what investment means um
[11:58] and what if I do invest money what is
[12:03] important for me and learning that it
[12:05] has to do with values and that I cannot
[12:08] I wouldn't be able to invest into
[12:09] something that doesn't confy with my
[12:12] values for example so which is why
[12:15] Bitcoin and at the end of the day once I
[12:18] I understood more of it is is something
[12:22] that really complies with my values so
[12:25] what which is why it has become more
[12:27] important in my life today do you think
[12:30] that when we are moving closer and
[12:33] closer to bitcoin standard more people
[12:34] understand Bitcoin that because I think
[12:37] this this belief set that oh he has
[12:40] money he has done something wrong um
[12:43] also might come from the fact that feed
[12:47] money favors the people that are already
[12:51] rich because when you have a lot of
[12:52] money you can make more easily more
[12:55] money um which is not as easy with
[12:58] Bitcoin because you everything has a
[13:00] proof of work thing uh with Fiat you
[13:03] basically have a yield like you you can
[13:05] do a lot of things with feed money you
[13:08] get cheaper credits and all those stuff
[13:10] um I mean I believe that a credit system
[13:12] will always kind of exist and also when
[13:15] you have a lot of Bitcoin you probably
[13:16] also get a better credit but not as uh
[13:18] with with the field system and that's
[13:21] why I think a lot of this beliefs are
[13:23] coming from that we have this field
[13:25] system they see something uh someone
[13:29] with a lot of money and the directly go
[13:33] like there oh he has to done something
[13:35] wrong he I don't know he robbed someone
[13:38] he does some dirty business whatever he
[13:40] does but it's probably wrong um what
[13:43] most people don't think about oh he has
[13:46] probably done a lot of work in his life
[13:48] oh he probably provided to a lot of
[13:50] people a lot of value why is Apple such
[13:53] an huge company they provided everyone
[13:56] with the internet and the phone and and
[13:58] with the the lap like they provided a
[14:00] lot of value to to society obviously
[14:02] they got rewarded a lot uh but still
[14:05] they provided a lot of value and it's
[14:08] it's like when you have a lot of money
[14:12] if you did not inherit it if you did not
[14:14] win it in a lottery uh if you did not do
[14:18] anything like that you probably worked
[14:21] really hard for that and even if the
[14:22] people that win it in the lottery they
[14:25] usually have less money after like what
[14:27] was it five years or something like that
[14:29] because they cannot handle it so it's
[14:31] like there's a mindset thing to it and
[14:33] the people that inherit it probably keep
[14:35] the money but not because of the capital
[14:37] more because of the human capital I feel
[14:39] like um do you think this could change
[14:42] on a on a on a Bitcoin standard when we
[14:45] have this proof of work mindset rather
[14:47] than oh he has money he has done
[14:49] something wrong more like oh he has
[14:51] money he did some
[14:53] work that's a good question I'm not
[14:56] quite sure because um
[14:59] because to for for for h for being able
[15:01] to have having a Bitcoin standard I mean
[15:04] I think that's a long way to go actually
[15:06] I don't think this is going to be that
[15:08] we're going to see this anytime soon so
[15:11] um and and the thing is particularly in
[15:14] our societies like Austria Germany or
[15:17] Europe in general I would say we don't
[15:19] have we don't have the problem yet so we
[15:22] don't see yet that it's it could be a
[15:26] solution like people you know like kids
[15:28] in Africa they they have a problem and
[15:31] they immediately understand what Bitcoin
[15:34] means but they understand it immediately
[15:36] because they have this problem that they
[15:38] need to solve right because they don't
[15:40] have access to a bank account etc etc so
[15:42] we don't have a problem
[15:44] yet at least not a problem that we feel
[15:48] or that that we can um grasp you know I
[15:52] mean people talk about it that you know
[15:54] there's you know inflation and you know
[15:57] the financial system cannot go on
[15:59] working like that etc etc but we don't
[16:02] have the problem yet so we're not
[16:04] looking for a
[16:05] solution so and I think it's going to be
[16:08] a process and in the process I would
[16:10] like to believe that you know mindset
[16:14] and that that we will be able to change
[16:17] with that and grow with it as as we
[16:21] understand more and more um but it's
[16:24] going to be a long way I think maybe to
[16:28] understand better what the the
[16:30] difference might be in society we we we
[16:33] could look at um what you did not
[16:36] understand about money that you
[16:37] understand now about money you mentioned
[16:38] that proof of work aspect that that you
[16:41] don't have this limited beliefs is there
[16:43] something else that that you learned uh
[16:46] uh about that or is is is that the the
[16:48] major thing I mean again also that's a
[16:51] that was a process and still is um
[16:53] because I don't think that you have all
[16:56] of a sudden you have the Epiphany and
[16:58] then you know you know you know
[16:59] everything and then that's it so I don't
[17:01] think that's that's how life works so um
[17:04] it's still a process and I still adjust
[17:07] to new um realizations I have about
[17:11] money there was a time when I first
[17:14] started out that I was sort of Falling
[17:16] For You know this um you know you just
[17:20] have to ask and it'll be
[17:22] given you know you just have to ask the
[17:25] universe and you just have to feel rich
[17:27] and once you feel rich then is going to
[17:29] come by itself um I looked into that
[17:32] kind of stuff as well because it was it
[17:34] was part of the process right so but
[17:36] today I'm much more critical and and I
[17:40] do think that Bitcoin different from all
[17:44] the other stuff that that's available
[17:47] that Bitcoin offers
[17:49] you
[17:50] um because of the proof of work aspect
[17:53] it offers you a different experience you
[17:56] know with um because if you if
[17:59] what do you do if you if you want to
[18:00] invest what options do you have right
[18:03] you can buy shares you can buy funds you
[18:05] can you can uh that's not the right word
[18:07] but you know what I mean um you know you
[18:10] can you can invest into companies you
[18:12] can uh do basically world I don't know
[18:18] so but um but that doesn't that doesn't
[18:22] um it gives you a a certain possibility
[18:26] of of a of a turn return on invest but
[18:29] it doesn't really do anything for you so
[18:32] with Bitcoin I think it's different
[18:34] because you have to first of all it's
[18:37] it's it's about being responsible
[18:38] yourself if you do all the other stuff
[18:41] it's you don't have to be so responsible
[18:43] you know you buy an ETF you and and and
[18:46] so what there's there's nothing much to
[18:48] it but if you if you deal with Bitcoin
[18:51] you have
[18:52] to be much more conscious about your
[18:55] decision and you have to be responsible
[18:57] um and and uh that's one of the main
[19:02] things that I think we don't have yet we
[19:04] don't see yet that people are really
[19:07] responsible for what for the for their
[19:09] own decisions and that's true for for
[19:11] like everything in life but particularly
[19:14] with money and um you know the choices
[19:18] you make so I think that's really that's
[19:21] really important and it does change the
[19:23] way you look at things if you have
[19:27] to really take responsibility it's
[19:30] fascinating for me because I have a
[19:31] Bitcoin podcast and I before I have as
[19:36] as everyone here knows
[19:38] but before I even got into Bitcoin I had
[19:42] a YouTube channel about stocks I also
[19:45] watch a lot of stocks uh um YouTube
[19:48] channels and podcasts and the most
[19:51] significant difference is on a stock uh
[19:55] podcast you talk about stocks about
[19:57] management team about what what stock
[20:00] will perform good what stock will
[20:02] perform not good on bitcoin podcasts you
[20:04] talk about everything there is parenting
[20:07] in there uh there there is uh so many
[20:11] nutrition stuff in there there's Sports
[20:13] in there there's mindset in there it's
[20:15] it's not like I think 50% of my of the
[20:19] time that I talk with guests is not
[20:20] about Bitcoin at all uh and uh I mean
[20:23] there are podcasts where I only talk
[20:25] about Bitcoin uh there are podcasts
[20:27] where I rarely talk about Bitcoin um but
[20:30] it's like Bitcoin is that one financial
[20:33] asset where when there's a podcast about
[20:35] that it goes way deeper than just the
[20:39] money part and and this is this is
[20:42] really fascinating and believe it or not
[20:45] I discovered that yesterday oh
[20:48] really no I I think that's that's that's
[20:51] really important though because uh like
[20:54] this holistic approach that you have
[20:56] when you when you when you deal with
[20:59] Bitcoin that it
[21:01] affects like it affects every area of
[21:04] your life if you really want to
[21:05] comprehend what what it is what it means
[21:08] and uh so yeah I'm I just booked my
[21:10] ticket to El Salvador yesterday I'm
[21:12] going to be in El Salvador in November
[21:14] for at least two months and to
[21:18] like take a deeper dive into a community
[21:22] that already has a Bitcoin St can you do
[21:25] you call it that a Bitcoin standard yeah
[21:27] I guess so right not not thank you you
[21:29] already made it halfway through the
[21:31] video and I'm really really grateful to
[21:33] have you here two things make this
[21:35] channel possible you as a watcher and
[21:37] listener who keep supporting this
[21:40] Channel and another one is all the
[21:42] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[21:44] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[21:46] very start and where I personally buy my
[21:48] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[21:50] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[21:53] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[21:56] simplest and securest way to secure your
[21:59] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[22:01] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[22:04] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[22:06] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[22:10] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[22:13] and you know your friend does not have
[22:14] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[22:16] he needs a birthday present and a small
[22:18] life Heck if you use code Robin you get
[22:20] 5% off your order plus you support my
[22:24] channel and now let's get back to the
[22:26] video it's it's uh
[22:29] I would say they Bitcoin standard
[22:31] because the government is stacking
[22:32] Bitcoin they're buying one Bitcoin a day
[22:35] uh Bitcoin is a legal tender there but
[22:37] legal tender does not mean that everyone
[22:39] accepts it they have like acceptance
[22:41] rate of maybe 30 40% it depends on what
[22:44] error you are in uh in like big cities
[22:46] like s Salvador or Berlin uh or or
[22:50] Bitcoin Beach of course they are like
[22:52] almost everyone accepts Bitcoin and and
[22:54] can transact in Bitcoin um but it's UNT
[22:58] not that easy even if the president and
[23:00] the government wants it it's like you
[23:02] cannot just switch and everyone then
[23:05] uses Bitcoin because you have to
[23:06] educates the people there uh and that's
[23:08] what a lot of people also not doing
[23:10] there and uh it's it's a process so so
[23:14] are they they're kind of on the process
[23:16] to getting to a Bitcoin standard legally
[23:18] they have it they have a legal tender in
[23:19] Bitcoin but most of the transactions
[23:22] most of the things are still happening
[23:23] in dollars uh even as Salvador even
[23:26] though they buy one Bitcoin a day only
[23:28] 4% of their reserves is in Bitcoin so
[23:31] they have a lot of dollar reserves they
[23:32] have a lot of other reserves um so it's
[23:35] it's I would not call it a full Bitcoin
[23:38] standard but they are the best country
[23:40] on the way to bitcoin standard if you
[23:42] call it like that yeah so I'm curious to
[23:45] find out you know um what the spirit is
[23:48] over there and and because I do believe
[23:50] that there's um a lot of innovation
[23:52] happening and you know like a and that's
[23:55] that's one of the things um actually
[23:57] relates to to what you were saying
[23:59] before in terms of Bitcoin not just
[24:01] being a financial asset or an asset as
[24:04] such but that it affects like in a
[24:07] holistic way a lot of areas of your life
[24:09] I think that's that's one of the most
[24:11] important things that to to comprehend
[24:14] that it's a process where you learn
[24:17] about yourself you learn about a
[24:20] community you learn about what's
[24:21] possible and it's it's so new I mean
[24:24] it's only 15 years old so nobody really
[24:27] knows where this is going to take us um
[24:30] we you know most of us feel or think
[24:33] that we we see the potential or the
[24:35] possibilities but I don't think we can
[24:38] actually grasp all of it yet because we
[24:42] don't know where the process will lead
[24:44] us um and it's a it's a it's an amazing
[24:47] it's an amazing
[24:49] opportunity and I hope we don't mess it
[24:51] up because if you know if anyone if
[24:53] anyone can mess it up it's the
[24:56] humans um but uh yeah
[25:00] but I'm really curious and this is I
[25:03] guess what my journey with Bitcoin is
[25:06] you know I'm I'm in general I'm very
[25:09] curious and I look into different things
[25:10] all the time trying to you know get New
[25:12] Perspectives but in this case it just it
[25:15] just opens up so many new aspects that
[25:19] you we didn't have before you know it
[25:21] didn't exist so it definitely does I
[25:25] even have um uh yesterday had some of
[25:29] Salvador G on I have done around 10
[25:32] interviews with people from Salvador or
[25:34] people that have been moving to El
[25:36] Salvador probably like even 15 and I
[25:39] promised her to make an playlist on my
[25:43] Channel with all Salvadorian uh
[25:45] interviews uh because they they're
[25:48] getting a
[25:49] lot and I think that's a it's a great
[25:51] way to get into uh what's happening in
[25:55] Salvador like every interview and I
[25:57] interviewed so many different people
[25:59] there you get such an great feeling of
[26:03] what's actually happening there um how
[26:05] the adoptions actually progressing and I
[26:08] also want to go to Salvador I actually
[26:10] also plan to go in November I've not uh
[26:14] B my tickets but maybe we see each other
[26:16] in in November than in the salor it
[26:17] would would be amazing GNA come for the
[26:20] conference yes like this is my plan like
[26:23] if I go to Salvador I want to be there
[26:25] longer than just a conference but I
[26:27] definitely want to see the conference um
[26:29] I don't know about two months but I
[26:31] could imagine like one month uh being
[26:33] there because the flight is also long
[26:35] like everything under two weeks I feel
[26:37] like it's it's not worth the the long
[26:39] flights uh from from Austria or even
[26:41] also from Germany um so I really want to
[26:44] go there and want to experience what
[26:46] what life is all about in the the
[26:48] closest thing we have to bitcoin
[26:50] standard I mean Nigeria is also I think
[26:53] Nigeria has actually the highest
[26:55] Crossroads movement of of of Bitcoin one
[26:58] it would also be interesting to to check
[27:00] that out because there the government
[27:02] has not adopted it but the people need
[27:04] it so much that they from themselves
[27:07] adopted it that much um but yeah zador
[27:10] itself also had a really big need to
[27:13] know about Bitcoin uh that's why they
[27:15] adopted it um but you you also brought
[27:17] up a really interesting point about self
[27:19] responsibility you also had to learn
[27:21] about self custody right yes so that how
[27:25] was that how was that process of of of
[27:27] getting
[27:28] something completely new because I see a
[27:30] lot of Bitcoin don't do it like I have I
[27:32] have friends who are 24 completely taxy
[27:36] they're doing all the things and and
[27:38] they're like what why should I buy SF
[27:40] CIA Hardware wallet like and I saw also
[27:42] the statistics only 2% of Bitcoin
[27:44] hodlers actually have a hardare wallet
[27:47] it's still on exchanges
[27:49] right yeah yeah well that that changed
[27:52] for me when I was in inbrook you know
[27:54] when I was listening to all these people
[27:57] uh at the Bitcoin conference so um yeah
[27:59] and and I'm also you know I'm part of
[28:01] the
[28:02] lean you probably heard of them that's a
[28:05] bit you know Rachel guia and some other
[28:08] women Nicole Nicole Novak from Bitcoin
[28:12] quotz they they founded leam zange which
[28:15] which is a Bitcoin education
[28:18] platform by women for women so we have
[28:22] like lots of meetups and and we you know
[28:25] you can you can just learn there how to
[28:26] install for example a bit box or
[28:28] something you know how to how to how to
[28:31] do it
[28:32] properly yeah but it's not that
[28:34] difficult I mean it's just it's like
[28:36] with everything um before I started
[28:38] dealing with finances um the whole idea
[28:42] of having to learn about money and
[28:45] finances and investment and and and
[28:47] later Bitcoin felt like such a big thing
[28:51] such a complex difficult complicated
[28:54] thing and it's not if you take it a step
[28:56] at a time it's just not so um but that's
[28:59] what what um is being I mean we were not
[29:03] being taught about this at all in school
[29:05] or anywhere so and and even our society
[29:09] is not
[29:10] supportive it's changing now but my my
[29:13] kids are like 27 and 29 so I there's
[29:18] some things change but a lot of things
[29:20] haven't really changed that much in
[29:21] terms of the the money mindset and you
[29:24] know how
[29:25] you you know you just go work you have
[29:28] your salary and then you know if you're
[29:30] lucky you do like a like a what's a spa
[29:33] plan in English uh you do a savings plan
[29:36] yeah Savings Plan like you know a small
[29:39] portion of your salary goes into a ETF
[29:42] savings plan or
[29:43] something but nobody really is
[29:46] consciously making decisions and really
[29:48] being responsible that's I don't think
[29:51] that has changed so much I sometimes
[29:53] wonder where if if if because I see like
[29:58] people that are now in Bitcoin they got
[30:00] influenced usually not by as yourself
[30:03] not by Bitcoin itself more by the
[30:05] environment they in then because they go
[30:07] to the Bitcoin conferences they go to
[30:09] the people so it's more like the people
[30:10] inside of Bitcoin then influence the
[30:12] newcomers coming into Bitcoin and I got
[30:15] really educated by Bitcoin Twitter
[30:17] because I wanted to get involved in the
[30:20] conversation on on Twitter and and I
[30:22] made just five tweets a day like every
[30:24] day made five tweets and joined the
[30:26] conversation that way and uh some you
[30:29] put something out and people like oh
[30:31] that's so wrong that's so wrong here are
[30:32] like five articles to read about why you
[30:35] are wrong because Twitter you they can
[30:38] be really harsh to you but it's it's
[30:40] good like I really got the toxicity of
[30:42] of Bitcoin Twitter but for me it was
[30:44] good uh because it kind of um put me in
[30:48] the right direction in terms of like
[30:50] what uh what resources to look in even
[30:53] though I would not consider myself toxic
[30:56] I'm just like if if for example like
[30:58] altcoins I think they will all go to
[31:01] zero but I don't have to scream on them
[31:04] like they they can just live like if if
[31:06] Bitcoin is successful like why should we
[31:08] scream against them um even though I
[31:11] would never uh recommend everyone anyone
[31:14] to to buy them but also interesting um
[31:17] Nicole was already on the podcast and
[31:20] Rachel already scheduled so she will
[31:22] also be really soon on there maybe I
[31:24] have to make also less F playlist at
[31:27] some point yeah yes yeah you should yeah
[31:31] um do this topic because we talked about
[31:33] that a little bit before the podcast and
[31:35] I told you my statistics that like I
[31:37] went from 97% male viewers to 92% male
[31:42] viewers that the biggest uh female
[31:46] podcast Natalie Brunell has like 20%
[31:48] female viewers I think it was like two
[31:51] three months ago it should be around
[31:53] that even now um how can we inspire uh
[31:58] like first of all what why do you think
[32:01] that is like what do you think it's like
[32:03] is it just because money and Tech is is
[32:05] not that female dominated so therefore
[32:09] Bitcoin is also not or like where does
[32:11] this come from and will this ever change
[32:13] will this ever change I don't know I
[32:15] think it is changing um but it's really
[32:18] slow you know I mean I've been around
[32:20] for a while you know when I
[32:23] was um in my early 20s you know feminism
[32:26] was a big thing you know that was in the
[32:28] 80s and and nothing much came of it I
[32:32] mean I don't want to go in go really
[32:34] into that topic but my experience is
[32:37] it's just it's just my experience
[32:39] especially with money and and and then
[32:42] of course Bitcoin that and Tech has to
[32:44] do with it um I mean the fact that
[32:47] Bitcoin is like a seems to be a
[32:50] technical thing you know and
[32:52] understanding the blockchain and stuff
[32:53] so so that's something that um
[32:57] women women do things differently and
[33:01] they um interesting enough when they do
[33:04] invest they they're better than men that
[33:07] the statistics are clear about that that
[33:09] women are better investors they they
[33:11] have better
[33:13] results when they if they do it you know
[33:16] but I mean the the majority is is just
[33:19] we are just trained in a different way
[33:21] we're conditioned in a different way
[33:22] that's really the reality of it still we
[33:24] still are so um because men you know as
[33:28] guys have to be the provider I mean this
[33:30] is cliche but it's still true right so
[33:32] you're trained to make money to buy a
[33:35] house and to be the provider as women we
[33:37] are not trained that way we are trained
[33:40] to not to be too loud and not to you
[33:42] know be nice and smile and and and you
[33:45] know find a
[33:46] provider I I know that sounds really
[33:49] simplistic but there's there's still a
[33:52] truth in there so that's how we are
[33:54] being conditioned when we grow up still
[33:57] so I I think that's part of it um and I
[34:00] think it needs to change and and that's
[34:02] what I'm that's really part of my
[34:04] mission as well as a as a private
[34:07] bitcoiner person you know because I
[34:09] Inspire women that you know I encounter
[34:11] everywhere I go and I do talk about
[34:15] Bitcoin without trying to convince
[34:18] anyone because it's really your own
[34:20] decision and you really have to come to
[34:22] a point where where you're responsible
[34:24] yourself and you don't do something just
[34:26] because I you you know I tell you it's a
[34:28] good idea so I think that's really
[34:31] important um and you mentioned something
[34:33] else um just before that question which
[34:36] I think is really important because you
[34:38] were talking about toxicity in you know
[34:41] on the
[34:42] Twitter um on your Twitter
[34:45] exchange one thing that I think is
[34:48] really important is that as
[34:51] bitcoiners it it shouldn't be a
[34:54] religion and I do know that some there
[34:58] are some enthusiasts out there who where
[35:02] it feels like they're treating it like a
[35:04] religion right
[35:06] um but I think that's always dangerous
[35:10] because it shouldn't be a Dogma it
[35:11] shouldn't be a religion it should just
[35:13] you know s it should serve all of us and
[35:16] as a community um I think it's important
[35:19] that we grow together and that it's you
[35:22] know it's it's for our all all of our
[35:24] benefits and not like this is the only
[35:27] way I I I think I just needed to mention
[35:30] that because I think that's really
[35:31] important too and we have to acknowledge
[35:35] the bitco is a tool uh a tool in our
[35:38] tool set that we can use and
[35:41] not there there are two two two sides in
[35:44] my in my heart right now because it's
[35:46] just a tool it's just money in the end
[35:48] of the day and but because it's so
[35:51] Revolution there and because it could
[35:53] change we don't know if if it actually
[35:55] will change a lot but we see the early
[35:58] things already when we go to bitcoin me
[36:00] Bitcoin conferences we see the the early
[36:02] things that Bitcoin could change that's
[36:04] why a lot of people I think think so
[36:07] religiously because they discover with
[36:09] Bitcoin a different world because they
[36:11] is cover different people but I think
[36:13] this effect will slow down
[36:17] because when we not early and the crowd
[36:21] just gets so much bigger um this effect
[36:24] will uh vanish a little bit and then
[36:27] Bitcoin will be just money and will be
[36:29] just the best store of value that you
[36:31] possibly can have and that's amazing
[36:34] thing like that's that it itself is
[36:35] amazing thing and and people fall in
[36:37] love with their cars people fall in love
[36:39] with with with everything so like um
[36:41] it's no wonder that Bitcoin like people
[36:44] also fall in love with with with Bitcoin
[36:46] and and treat it as like a religion um
[36:49] so I try to just treat it as an tool but
[36:53] I'm someone that talks about it every
[36:54] day
[36:56] so it's like
[36:58] uh it's it's it's interesting for me and
[37:01] I also said on the podcast uh when when
[37:03] Bitcoin gets boring for me and it will
[37:06] be boring at some point it's it's kind
[37:08] of I I see this as like uh the early
[37:11] internet there were in the early
[37:13] internet a lot of conferences about
[37:15] protocols about
[37:17] Technologies um they evolved a lot like
[37:21] there are no there's not the internet
[37:23] Conference of the world they they are
[37:25] now uh more segmented things that are on
[37:28] top of the internet as conferences and
[37:30] at this I also see in Bitcoin we have
[37:33] not Bitcoin conferences because we early
[37:35] and we're small but as Bitcoin actually
[37:38] grows in the whole world and let's say
[37:41] let's just assume now Bitcoin is like
[37:43] adopted 90% um who wants to talk about
[37:46] Bitcoin because it's such a no-brainer
[37:47] like everyone has it like it's it's it's
[37:49] like email Communications or like the
[37:51] the HTTP protocol of the internet like
[37:54] who who would go to a conference or go
[37:56] podcast and talk about that but there
[37:58] might be topics on top of Bitcoin that
[38:00] might be interesting because we have
[38:01] build a new layer free technology that
[38:04] revolutionizes how we pay in the store
[38:06] and Bitcoin I don't know um but
[38:09] uh Bitcoin will change over over time
[38:12] and it will be boring at some point and
[38:14] also this podcast will uh that's why I
[38:17] actually because when I started it I it
[38:19] was called the Bitcoin path and now it's
[38:21] just a robin s podcast because I'm aware
[38:24] that maybe in 20 years Bitcoin is boring
[38:27] and then I don't want to rename it I
[38:30] just like slowly uh get in a different
[38:32] topic because then my viewers are
[38:35] usually probably also not interested in
[38:37] in Bitcoin anymore when I'm not
[38:38] interested anymore but this was a long
[38:41] uh talking point and I don't even know
[38:42] what what my point really
[38:47] was it's all right yeah yeah but it's uh
[38:51] it's an it's an interesting uh uh F
[38:54] experiments I feel like um we started
[38:57] yeah for the for the last bit we started
[38:59] out with you know why women are not
[39:03] represented in in in the same way so um
[39:07] and for me it's not so important why
[39:10] that is um it's more important to
[39:13] actually invite you know invite women to
[39:17] um to deal with it study Bitcoin it's
[39:20] not as complicated you know it's it's
[39:22] it's little steps that you can take
[39:23] there's so much material out there to
[39:26] actually uh you know learn and Nicole's
[39:29] podcast is a good start if if you're are
[39:31] total newbie Nicole's podcast for German
[39:34] speaking audience is a is a good start
[39:37] and there's of course Much More Much
[39:39] More and also you know go to meetups and
[39:42] and um and and just connect with people
[39:44] because that's the other thing that's so
[39:46] important I find about Bitcoin is
[39:48] connecting with the community and
[39:50] connecting with people and it's AOW it's
[39:52] a growing community so it'll it's it's
[39:55] and yes in 10 years from now it's
[39:57] probably not about Bitcoin events
[39:59] anymore it it you know it'll be
[40:02] different because it'll be already
[40:04] established in a in a very different way
[40:07] um so yeah but the invitation is really
[40:10] and it doesn't matter how old you are I
[40:13] mean I'm a good example um it doesn't
[40:16] matter you know you just you just start
[40:18] and and uh and and you can take the path
[40:24] in in your own individual way and you
[40:26] can you know take take your steps how
[40:28] you how you need to do them and it's it
[40:30] might be different for for each person
[40:33] what do you find someone who knows more
[40:35] than you do that that that's what I
[40:37] always try to do with my podcast find
[40:39] find people smarter than me so I have
[40:42] better content on my podcast even though
[40:44] I'm not as smart yeah you know what they
[40:48] say right if you're the smartest in the
[40:50] room you're in the wrong
[40:51] room yes that that
[40:54] is um I have a question for you because
[40:56] you said that uh that you're older what
[40:59] do you think is the the average age uh
[41:02] of my viewers on this uh Channel I have
[41:05] no idea the average age of your viewers
[41:08] I would I would assume that
[41:12] um probably
[41:15] between 30 and 40 I would say but you
[41:19] you you know right so I know exactly
[41:21] yeah um because YouTube gives me this
[41:23] data which is freakingly hard to know
[41:26] all that stuff but
[41:28] uh I have under 25 uh I have only 8% of
[41:34] the viewers MH and over 65 I have no
[41:39] over
[41:42] 50 over 65 I have the same amount of
[41:45] viewers than under 25 okay which is
[41:48] fascinating and the average and the
[41:50] bracket where the most people are is
[41:52] between 35 and 44 see so that the the
[41:57] average is I think around 40 I would say
[42:02] so if I actually see the average it's
[42:04] probably like 40 years old and uh it's
[42:07] really interesting that I have double as
[42:09] many viewers above 55 than under
[42:14] 25 but doesn't surprise me though it
[42:17] doesn't surprise me at all because I
[42:19] think maybe that's that's an assumption
[42:21] I'm making but I think that you need to
[42:25] have like a little bit of wisdom already
[42:28] um like a little bit of life experience
[42:31] or something to be able to comprehend
[42:34] what this might mean I mean yeah I think
[42:37] so absolutely yeah and I also see the
[42:40] the difference between long form videos
[42:42] and short form it's
[42:45] interesting I see the difference between
[42:47] long form videos and short form videos
[42:50] short forms are male only 88% uh so way
[42:55] better there and the fewers ship is way
[42:58] younger but yeah it's it's it's
[43:01] interesting but yeah um enough of my
[43:05] podcast St this sorry for that
[43:08] interesting I just want to give few
[43:11] sometimes a little bit of insights um
[43:13] one last question one last Bitcoin
[43:15] question before we get to the end
[43:16] routine and other questions
[43:19] um why did you first gamble with or
[43:23] let's gamble invest in in altcoins and
[43:26] what made made you then change your mind
[43:28] back to bitcoin uh well initially uh
[43:31] when I started invest because I was
[43:33] looking at all of what I was doing as an
[43:35] asset and uh and part of my portfolio
[43:38] was like gambling and I didn't know I
[43:41] was a gambler but I have this this
[43:43] aspect of you know like having a
[43:46] highrisk profile actually so I didn't
[43:49] know that before and and that was
[43:51] gambling and and I of course I gambled
[43:56] with the goal to make a high return on
[43:59] invest didn't work out at
[44:02] all so this is German there's this
[44:06] German actually she's already dead but
[44:08] there was this German lady that was into
[44:10] stocks um
[44:11] Banda and uh she said that you have to
[44:16] avoid I only know that in German
[44:20] though
[44:22] pic
[44:24] gear when you deal with money investment
[44:27] and stuff you greed is something that is
[44:30] a very bad advisor just like fear and uh
[44:33] so but at the time you know I was
[44:35] gambling and and greed was definitely my
[44:39] ingredient to gamble because I felt like
[44:41] oh my God you know just like the scam I
[44:44] was in the reason why I lost a
[44:47] substantial amount of money was that I
[44:51] felt okay if I put in like a substantial
[44:54] amount now and then in 3 months I can
[44:56] take it out and then you know I you know
[44:58] I'll I'll be rich kind of thing and it
[45:01] totally backfired and uh you know that
[45:04] was exactly the time when it the whole
[45:06] thing imploded so altcoins for me was
[45:09] really gambling and some some greed and
[45:13] that's today I I think very differently
[45:16] about Investments and about money and
[45:20] about uh yeah so
[45:23] so it's it's not it's not about the
[45:26] return of invest yeah and and Bitcoin
[45:29] and the Bitcoin Community teaches you
[45:31] that there there is no yield and uh you
[45:35] you should just stay hle in stack sets
[45:38] um you also made a a picture of of of me
[45:41] in Bitcoin Prague um are you doing that
[45:44] uh professionally or like what I am you
[45:47] do I am yeah after after my corporate
[45:50] time I mean I've always been a
[45:51] photographer I did that like on the side
[45:54] as a side hustle for a long time but
[45:57] once I uh stepped out of the corporate
[45:59] world when my kids were growing up uh I
[46:01] started as a professional photographer
[46:03] like 10 15 years ago so yeah really cool
[46:07] it was a nice picture I just posted it I
[46:09] think 5 10 minutes before we get on the
[46:12] podcast okay uh I also was not finding
[46:16] your uh Twitter handle but someone else
[46:20] wasion my Handi passion someone
[46:24] immediately after like one two minutes
[46:26] commented oh that's uh Satoshi
[46:29] passion and then then I added it in so
[46:32] this was really quick I think it was
[46:34] Chris from um
[46:36] cedor oh okay yeah yeah he said to you
[46:40] that you're making the best photos in
[46:42] whole
[46:45] bit yeah thank you yeah it's one of my
[46:48] really one of my passions um and um it's
[46:51] one of the things I really like doing up
[46:54] perfect then let's come to the endro
[46:55] Andro is uh existing as two questions
[46:58] the one question is always the same even
[47:00] though I changed it a little bit a few
[47:03] podcasts before and the other one is um
[47:07] the end routine where the previous guest
[47:08] is asking a question for the next guest
[47:10] the first question that is always uh the
[47:12] question that's always the same is what
[47:15] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin oh
[47:17] wow stay curious and really find your
[47:21] own path doesn't matter whether it's
[47:23] with Bitcoin or without Bitcoin it's
[47:25] really about and I would of course you
[47:27] know the invitation is to look at it
[47:30] study it and then you can make a
[47:31] decision but if you don't know anything
[47:33] about it you can't make a
[47:35] decision it's never too late I think
[47:37] that's something that you can learn from
[47:39] me too it's it's really never too late
[47:42] and um the best time is now
[47:45] always I love that um the endro team
[47:49] where the previous guest asking a
[47:50] question for the next guest without
[47:51] knowing who the next guest actually is
[47:54] um and the question for you is tell us
[47:56] it's it's not a question it's more like
[47:58] a command but tell us a random fun fact
[48:02] about yourself a random fun fact the the
[48:05] the first thing that comes to my mind is
[48:07] that I I'm a photographer and I have
[48:10] like big oo do you hear that is it is it
[48:15] 12 it's the yeah it's the fire the fire
[48:18] alarm going on I can't do anything about
[48:20] it is it loud It's okay I feel like okay
[48:25] uh so um have you know lots of equipment
[48:28] but one of my favorite things that I do
[48:31] is taking pictures with my phone when I
[48:33] pass by somewhere so I have a whole
[48:36] series it's pretty random because I do
[48:39] it randomly and uh the best camera you
[48:42] have is always the one that you carry
[48:43] with you so um it's always the best one
[48:47] and so I take I I have a a whole series
[48:50] of pictures where I just pass by
[48:53] somewhere and I see something and and I
[48:55] take a shot just passing by so very
[48:58] random really cool thank you um before I
[49:01] let you go where can people find you I
[49:03] didn't hear that because it's I still
[49:05] have the fire alarm
[49:07] here okay I will I will I'll try it
[49:10] again uh where can people find you where
[49:12] can people ask you questions like is
