[00:00] I can't see why anybody and everybody
[00:04] wouldn't want to operate on a Bitcoin
[00:06] system as Bitcoin continues to
[00:08] appreciate in Fiat terms I'm no longer
[00:10] incentivized to put a debt on my
[00:13] property to keep refinancing my property
[00:16] I'm incentivized to utilize Bitcoin for
[00:20] the long term and run my business on a a
[00:23] Bitcoin standard which will allow me to
[00:27] eliminate the need for future renting
[00:29] increases he's recognized $1,400 in
[00:32] savings over the course of the last 14
[00:35] months of rent that he's paid just by
[00:37] paying me in Bitcoin the systems that we
[00:39] have are extractive and we're all trying
[00:42] to like extract as much money as we can
[00:44] from the next person the landscape is
[00:47] completely different and it is so much
[00:49] stronger and positive for Bitcoin that I
[00:52] cannot see how anybody would fight this
[00:55] nobody can win this fight they can dig
[00:57] in their heels they can try to stop it
[00:59] they can try to ban it but they are
[01:02] going to
[01:03] [Music]
[01:07] lose I I I know you've had I think Jeff
[01:11] Booth on not too terribly long ago um I
[01:15] don't remember when it was exactly but
[01:17] you know I I watch a lot of Jeff Boo's
[01:19] stuff and when he's talking about the
[01:24] extractive uh system that is the Fiat
[01:27] World um and then the Bitcoin world
[01:29] where we can all be working in a
[01:32] Cooperative system um this is what
[01:36] strikes me as playing right
[01:39] into that change in thinking for all of
[01:45] us
[01:47] where I as a business person running a
[01:50] running a company sure I could look at
[01:52] this and go well that that value of the
[01:55] Bitcoin that he's paid me is 20,000 and
[01:57] I could assume all of that value
[02:01] increase or that appreciation
[02:04] increase but I can
[02:07] also share that value increase with my
[02:11] customer in basically my resident right
[02:15] and we can both win from it and all all
[02:18] it takes is me as a business owner
[02:20] saying I want to use Bitcoin and them as
[02:25] my customer saying I want to use Bitcoin
[02:29] and agree
[02:30] to this so so basically um just like
[02:35] summarizing what you also said last time
[02:38] and I think we can jump directly into
[02:40] that um you are offering your tendance
[02:46] to pay with Bitcoin and if they pay in
[02:49] Bitcoin then uh a share of the
[02:52] appreciation of those
[02:54] Bitcoin uh uh will be accounted for the
[02:58] rent and then they have to pay less rent
[02:59] R is that
[03:01] correct correct yeah interesting yeah
[03:04] that's I mean obviously as you said as a
[03:06] businessman you're like okay you uh you
[03:09] you could either accept the Bitcoin
[03:10] payments or the dollar payments if the
[03:12] pay taller you can also just directly
[03:15] buy Bitcoin with that and then you have
[03:16] 100% of the
[03:18] appreciation um but with that you
[03:21] basically uh philanthropically
[03:25] incentivizing um more Bitcoin payments
[03:28] in a sense
[03:31] yeah kind kind of I I don't like I don't
[03:33] even look at it as uh philanthropy right
[03:37] I just look at it as this is the kind of
[03:41] business we can run on bitcoin and and
[03:44] when I look at the two
[03:45] systems of Fiat versus
[03:48] Bitcoin I can't see why anybody and
[03:53] everybody wouldn't want to operate in on
[03:56] a Bitcoin system when when you can do
[03:58] this type of
[04:01] um incentives when you can you can
[04:04] structure your business this way right
[04:07] and then I mean and now let's you know
[04:10] you can get into further orders of
[04:13] effects from this right where as Bitcoin
[04:18] continues to appreciate in Fiat terms
[04:21] I'm I'm not I'm no longer incentivized
[04:24] to put a put a debt on my property to
[04:28] keep refinancing my my property I'm
[04:31] incentivized
[04:32] to um utilize Bitcoin for the long term
[04:37] and
[04:39] to
[04:41] um run my business on a on a Bitcoin
[04:45] standard which will allow me to
[04:49] eliminate the need for future rent
[04:52] increases
[04:54] because I'm I'm I'm bringing in Bitcoin
[04:58] which is appreciating in value I'm
[05:01] eliminating the debt coverage on the
[05:03] property in the first place and I I can
[05:07] now hold my rents steady or reduce them
[05:11] as the Fiat world around us continues to
[05:15] crumble or get more difficult and as a
[05:18] as a business provider I'm going to be
[05:20] doing even a better job of um operating
[05:24] a more profitable long-term sustainable
[05:27] business going forward uhoh is that me
[05:31] if I do the thumbs up that's oh geez how
[05:34] can I turn that
[05:35] off H yeah that's that that's on the
[05:38] iPhone I also have it on the Mac but uh
[05:41] I I turn it off because if I turn it on
[05:44] my camera stops working unfortunately oh
[05:47] really all right on iPhone it's fine
[05:50] yeah it's like you can do one th and
[05:53] then it will go with like one Farm if
[05:55] you do both you get like the fireworks
[05:58] you can even do like stuff like
[06:01] that yeah I'll try not to do any of that
[06:05] as we go here I should have shut that
[06:07] off no no no worries no worries it
[06:09] happens actually sometimes in the
[06:10] podcast I think I've seen it every once
[06:13] in a while yeah I've seen it as well
[06:16] yeah yep absolutely um it it kind of
[06:19] ties back into the whole thing of what
[06:22] the power of Bitcoin is besides just
[06:25] having it as a store of value more also
[06:29] medium of exchange and unit of account
[06:31] are you then also accounting for for
[06:35] Bitcoin are you trying to slowly get
[06:36] into this mindset of like okay how much
[06:39] how many Bitcoins do I make and not how
[06:42] many satosi do I
[06:45] do yeah Absolut well Bitcoins or Satoshi
[06:50] right dollars yeah dollars and
[06:53] satosi yeah no no worries no worries I
[06:56] knew what you meant um yeah absolutely I
[06:59] mean and again on on this spreadsheet
[07:01] you can see you know this this tenant
[07:03] alone has paid me 2/10 of a Bitcoin
[07:07] right um oh wait I I still didn't share
[07:10] it uh maybe let's uh start with that
[07:13] directly and and show it to people um if
[07:16] you don't mind uh I mean it's a lot of
[07:19] numbers uh but I think you can uh maybe
[07:23] explain it to us so it makes sense um
[07:26] let me quickly share it uh so you also
[07:30] see what I
[07:32] see it's right here do you see it now
[07:36] yep yep I sure
[07:38] do that's perfect should we start some
[07:42] people or
[07:45] down um I think that's probably a good
[07:48] spot right there um you know that you
[07:52] can see the the kind of the middle
[07:55] yellow bars there in the middle of the
[07:57] screen so um that that should be a good
[08:00] spot to start okay and what are we
[08:03] seeing uh
[08:05] here yeah so you we've got the the total
[08:11] US dollar payment or in in US dollar
[08:15] terms of the Bitcoin payment for rent at
[08:19] my
[08:20] property and so that that total Fiat US
[08:24] dollar value is
[08:27] $1,751 there you can see and then right
[08:29] next to it is.2 or you know uh what is
[08:33] that 20 20 million 200 million
[08:36] Satoshi yeah 20 million Satoshi yeah 20
[08:40] million Satoshi um and you know you can
[08:43] see right below that then the value of
[08:46] that Bitcoin as it stands this was on
[08:50] January
[08:51] 1st uh would have been
[08:54] $20,000 uh in US dollar
[08:57] terms um and so the the cool thing about
[09:02] I think about this spreadsheet while yes
[09:05] it is a ton of numbers it really helps
[09:09] you uh and me and my renter understand
[09:14] the benefit that they're able to see or
[09:17] to realize by the um the deal that we
[09:22] have right which again is we split any
[09:28] appreciation in the
[09:31] USD value of the Bitcoin that they pay
[09:34] me in
[09:35] rent uh 5050 for up to 6 months after
[09:39] they make that payment to me and so um
[09:44] if you know when you go up to the green
[09:47] boxes and the kind of up near the top of
[09:49] the spreadsheet there it starts showing
[09:51] you know back in at the end of October
[09:54] November 1st basically the rent that
[09:56] they paid um there was a little snafu he
[10:00] paid a little extra and I had to send
[10:02] him some some stats back um but you know
[10:08] he he paid the equivalent of 900 sorry
[10:12] $855 in rent that month in
[10:17] Bitcoin and then if you follow that all
[10:19] the way over to the right side of the
[10:21] screen you you know just pass the black
[10:24] bar you can see the value at the time
[10:26] that he purchased that Bitcoin or sent
[10:28] that Bitcoin coin to me um and then the
[10:32] value of that Bitcoin when he recognized
[10:36] that price uh or that that savings at
[10:39] the end of April was
[10:41] $60,000 if you go over a couple more
[10:44] boxes there and so you know the the
[10:48] $855 that he paid had a appreciation of
[10:53] $326
[10:55] 186 um which we were um
[11:00] able to split with him um based on that
[11:04] 50/50 split and he was able to recognize
[11:08] $150 or
[11:10] $163 of savings on his next month's
[11:14] rent and I don't have that calculation
[11:17] on here showing that that deduction it's
[11:20] just every every payment every month
[11:22] that he made um going forward from there
[11:27] um and and so you know if you again
[11:30] going back down to the the bottom there
[11:33] um to date uh he's
[11:37] recognized um actually now I see this
[11:40] doesn't have
[11:44] um uh no it does have it yeah he's
[11:47] recognized $1,400 in savings over the
[11:51] course of the last 14 months of rent
[11:53] that he's paid so the equivalent of $100
[11:56] a month off of his rent uh just just by
[11:59] paying me in Bitcoin and and having that
[12:03] agreement with him just by the incentive
[12:05] changing
[12:07] there
[12:09] and you know this
[12:11] is I I keep going back to Jeff Booth in
[12:14] my head um and and when he talks about
[12:18] how we live in an you know under the
[12:20] Fiat standard uh the the world the
[12:24] systems that we have are extractive and
[12:27] we're all trying to
[12:30] you know I I say this to my wife all the
[12:32] time we're all trying to like extract as
[12:35] much money as we can from the next
[12:37] person and try and stay ahead of the
[12:38] Joneses or or get ahead of the Joneses
[12:41] so to speak and that really has a pretty
[12:47] big psychological effect on people and
[12:50] and I think it really has played into
[12:52] our you know the entire
[12:54] world's um mindset as to how you get
[12:59] ahead in life and how you run a business
[13:03] and how you treat how we treat each
[13:05] other
[13:07] and when I when I look at that system
[13:11] and I compare it and contrast it to a
[13:15] Bitcoin system so I
[13:18] mean if if I can run my business
[13:23] profitably you know enough to pay the
[13:25] bills and have a little bit left over to
[13:29] maintain the building
[13:32] um I I don't see why every business on
[13:37] the planet can't operate something
[13:39] somehow some way like this and so it
[13:44] really
[13:47] is uh it it's it's a big change in
[13:52] mindset and it it's a big jump for
[13:54] people and I think even in the Bitcoin
[13:57] world I think a lot of people still have
[14:01] trouble wrapping their mind around
[14:04] something like this because it seems
[14:06] like I'm giving away the bank so to
[14:08] speak or I'm you know you look at that
[14:10] $20,000 amount to the value of that
[14:12] Bitcoin there and I could have realized
[14:15] all of that value
[14:18] myself uh but then when I think about
[14:21] that I think what is what's the point of
[14:25] having Bitcoin what's the point of
[14:27] having this sound money that nobody can
[14:30] mess with that we're all working so hard
[14:32] to try and build new businesses on and
[14:36] trying to work towards improving the
[14:40] life of everybody on the
[14:42] planet when if if if we're not at least
[14:47] sharing some of that profit with people
[14:50] or some of that value appreciation so I
[14:53] I I I even like I try not to think of it
[14:56] in profit and loss terms it's it's
[14:58] really
[14:59] the value that my residents are giving
[15:01] to me and the value that I'm giving to
[15:04] them we able to share in going forward
[15:07] in
[15:09] time are you doing uh are you doing the
[15:12] same thing with the security
[15:15] deposit uh so I would love to do the
[15:19] same thing with the security deposit I
[15:20] don't um I think I certainly could do
[15:24] that um I haven't actually taken a
[15:27] security deposit from anybody since I
[15:30] came up with this idea I've had so
[15:32] luckily for me our our residents have
[15:35] been long-term residents our newest
[15:38] resident moved in two and a half years
[15:40] ago um so it was a little bit before
[15:43] this time so but I certainly would be
[15:46] willing to do it because I always think
[15:48] like the security deposit like just just
[15:51] give it to me yeah I will invest in
[15:54] Bitcoin uh and you you you can even have
[15:58] a little bit more to security deposit of
[16:00] the end of my uh renting uh if if you
[16:03] want and it's it's fine but it's like I
[16:06] I don't I I don't like that they they
[16:08] just it's it's so normal that they just
[16:10] take that money from you uh because
[16:12] there are other security like you uh
[16:15] what is the risk that I that I leave the
[16:17] town like you cann't that that that risk
[16:21] so many businesses have to uh deal with
[16:24] why is uh why are landlords uh getting
[16:27] the security deposits
[16:30] absolutely in a in a hotel I never have
[16:32] to put a the security deposit on if if I
[16:35] stay in something like an ABNB there's a
[16:37] security deposit so it's an it's a weird
[16:40] thing I don't know like uh I don't know
[16:42] if it has something to do with Bitcoin
[16:44] but do why is the security deposit even
[16:47] there in the first place like do you
[16:49] have a reason for that like is there is
[16:51] there some some is it grown out of the
[16:54] history or is there something else yeah
[16:57] yeah I I think from what I what I know
[17:01] uh what I understand it it is just kind
[17:04] of a a remnant of the historical past so
[17:09] when when times were a little bit
[17:11] different and you you know you really
[17:14] depended on that person to be living in
[17:16] the apartment and it
[17:19] wasn't uh housing wasn't in such short
[17:23] supply tenants residents really had the
[17:26] option of going picking up and going to
[17:29] another place um and so then landlords
[17:32] figured out a way to make to get the
[17:35] government to say hey we got to hold
[17:38] some money from the resident to ensure
[17:42] that if they do just pack up and go I
[17:44] can recoup some of the rent that I'm
[17:47] going to lose you know if they're in a
[17:49] one-year lease or something certainly in
[17:51] month-to-month leases uh it makes less
[17:54] sense um you know part of that though is
[17:57] is also the damage side it's things so
[17:59] but you're 100% right I I think um
[18:03] certainly putting everybody's security
[18:05] deposits into Bitcoin and just holding
[18:07] it there for them makes 100% sense and
[18:11] then if there is any
[18:13] damage um taking it out of the
[18:16] appreciation of that Bitcoin first and
[18:19] then giving them their security deposit
[18:22] back uh when they move out makes perfect
[18:25] sense for sure so absolutely I think
[18:29] yeah sorry I was just going to I was
[18:32] going to add I I think um a shoot now I
[18:36] kind of lost my train of thought um
[18:39] it in some states in in the US anyway I
[18:44] am aware that uh landlords do have to
[18:46] pay interest on security
[18:49] deposits uh to the
[18:52] residents um at the end of their lease
[18:55] so you know if somebody at it never used
[18:59] to be a thing and and then some states
[19:02] have passed laws where if you're
[19:03] charging A month's rent a security
[19:05] deposit you have to pay interest to the
[19:08] tenant again it's minimal you know it's
[19:11] 2% 3% maybe so but putting it in Bitcoin
[19:15] would
[19:15] definitely most likely be a better
[19:18] long-term solution to that so Ah that's
[19:22] I even had some uh security deposit uh
[19:25] back then in Munich and they were
[19:28] holding it till they got the uh inverse
[19:32] for the end bill of the energy thing so
[19:35] it took me after I even moved out seven
[19:38] months to get the security deposit back
[19:40] and I was so mad uh even though it was
[19:42] not a huge amount of money but it's just
[19:45] like oh like you see the opportunity
[19:47] cost there you see the opportunity cost
[19:49] because you know you could have put that
[19:52] in Bitcoin you could have done something
[19:54] with that uh and if you hold even a
[19:57] small amount of Bitcoin for seven months
[20:01] that could be a very very good choice to
[20:05] do it that and it just completely flips
[20:08] your thinking once you start thinking in
[20:10] in Bitcoin that's why I also asked you
[20:12] of like if you started thinking in in
[20:14] satosi if you started thinking in the
[20:16] unit of account of Bitcoin because it's
[20:19] a total Game Changer as as I think uh
[20:22] you you still think um in US dollars
[20:25] probably mostly you also probably uh
[20:28] give your rent rent uh prices out like
[20:31] your your rent numbers in US Dollars I
[20:35] guess yeah a as of right now um you know
[20:40] just the way the laws are written in the
[20:43] state um you have to denominate those uh
[20:48] rent amounts in US dollars in those
[20:51] leases um you know there's nothing I am
[20:55] working on an addendum to my lease that
[20:58] does put everything in um Bitcoin terms
[21:04] and Satoshi terms so or sat terms um but
[21:10] um you know I I don't know how that
[21:13] would hold up in a court of law it
[21:16] certainly has not gotten to a point
[21:18] where that needs to happen yet and and
[21:23] uh I'm sure as we progress through this
[21:28] uh you know the this worldwide system
[21:32] change from Fiat to bitcoin it's going
[21:35] to happen and and there will be laws
[21:38] written in Bitcoin terms and I I we're
[21:41] so early in this thing man it just it
[21:44] just it it's mindblowing to me how how
[21:49] much more work there is to do and how
[21:52] much more change there is that needs to
[21:55] happen um but it's also so reassuring to
[22:01] me to see it happening you know to know
[22:04] that I'm out there tell talking to other
[22:08] landlords and and owners of properties
[22:12] and spreading this word of how they're
[22:15] how they need to change and how they
[22:16] need to start thinking in Bitcoin terms
[22:19] and and how it can be a benefit to them
[22:21] and the residents in the long term and I
[22:25] I just
[22:26] know when when you know when we're as
[22:29] humans when we're faced with two options
[22:32] we're generally picking the one that is
[22:35] better for us we're not we're not trying
[22:38] to hurt ourselves financially or make
[22:40] our lives harder in in the old Fiat
[22:43] system and make it better in in the
[22:47] Bitcoin system and so I I think I was
[22:50] talking to one of my actually one of my
[22:52] managers one of my employees at another
[22:54] one of our properties about this couple
[22:57] weeks ago now and you know
[23:00] this this idea of these two systems
[23:03] being in place and and trying to
[23:09] convince people all all the quote
[23:12] unquote normies out there the all
[23:15] everybody operating in Fiat land to jump
[23:19] over to bitcoin is is hard
[23:21] because you know a lot of people don't
[23:24] see the value in it they they just don't
[23:27] see what what's in it for them how is it
[23:30] going to benefit them and so they're
[23:33] they're less likely to say yeah I want
[23:35] to switch over to that unless you can
[23:37] walk them through that that this concept
[23:39] this idea of how the system is going to
[23:42] be beneficial in the long run so and
[23:45] even then a lot of people go oh yeah it
[23:48] sounds like pie in the sky thinking and
[23:51] it's not not workable it's not
[23:54] sustainable it's not whatever they they
[23:56] throw up every every excuse we always
[23:59] hear right and uh it it's unfortunate
[24:03] but you know we'll we'll get there I I
[24:06] think this type of you know showing this
[24:08] chart and and this this type of work
[24:11] being done at different places
[24:15] is the proof in the pudding so to speak
[24:18] and you know I know from talking to my
[24:21] resident here Kyle that he is 100% on
[24:25] board he's even more on board now than
[24:26] he was you know 14 months ago when we
[24:29] started this little experiment and he
[24:31] sees the benefit to him himself and how
[24:34] it is helping make his life easier so
[24:40] he's spreading the word to other people
[24:42] did he get orange pilled with
[24:46] that uh I don't no he he was already
[24:51] kind of orange pilled I I I think he's
[24:54] more orange pilled now he you know when
[24:57] when we first started talking he was
[24:59] telling me about how he's got some
[25:01] altcoins and stuff like that and um here
[25:04] in the last two months now we've been
[25:06] talking and he's changed his perspective
[25:10] on that and how now he is 100% Bitcoin
[25:13] not messing around with all the other
[25:16] altcoins he is uh just focused on
[25:20] bitcoin at this point so he and his uh
[25:23] fiance I think uh want to um buy a house
[25:29] and so they are um maybe they're not
[25:32] fiance they might just be partners um
[25:36] but they you know they're they're
[25:37] looking at houses and
[25:40] um I I because I joked to him I said
[25:43] you're never going to want to move out
[25:44] of here um you know he's gonna
[25:48] eventually see this see his rent going
[25:51] down his cost of living going down why I
[25:54] I don't know why he would want to buy a
[25:56] house um other than having his own
[25:58] private space which you know again
[26:02] everybody has their
[26:04] own um kind of Line in the Sand so to
[26:07] speak as to what they're what they're
[26:10] willing to put up with so or live with
[26:12] yeah absolutely I
[26:14] mean is the question of how how much is
[26:18] it really yours if if the government can
[26:21] actually take it from you but yes I
[26:23] guess it's it's more yours uh than when
[26:26] you rent it uh of course but but uh it
[26:29] it's it's still not like people can
[26:32] still come into your house even if you
[26:34] don't want it um it's of course it's
[26:37] easier if someone else has the key to to
[26:39] your house I don't know if you hold the
[26:41] keys from your attendance but I think
[26:43] most actually do uh so that that's
[26:45] that's a big thing and yeah with Al
[26:48] coins is interesting because they they
[26:49] kind of lost the story I I don't know
[26:51] about you but I I don't hear a lot about
[26:53] Al coins I I hear some people talking
[26:56] about blockchain and web free and stuff
[26:58] like that but it's it's always another
[27:01] project it's like there's nothing
[27:03] sticking there like oh there altcoin
[27:05] then it goes the new one comes and then
[27:07] it goes the new one comes and then it
[27:08] goes it's like yeah they will never
[27:10] build
[27:11] anything there I feel like uh I I kind
[27:14] of softened on on altcoins a lot in the
[27:17] past year I was a really toxic Bitcoin
[27:19] Maxi and I was like hating on all
[27:21] altcoin projects now I just don't care
[27:23] about them I'm like yeah like they can
[27:27] live they can do their thing I don't
[27:28] care uh but yeah I feel like the Alin
[27:32] story kind of went away to a certain
[27:34] extent maybe it's I'm maybe I'm just in
[27:36] a big
[27:38] bubble yeah I I think I think it's
[27:41] probably a little bit of both I would
[27:43] imagine um I certainly you know I kind
[27:48] of facilitate a monthly Bitcoin Meetup
[27:51] here um and every so we've got you know
[27:55] people new people come in and they're
[27:58] generally the ones that will bring up
[28:01] altcoins uh during the conversation even
[28:04] though we clearly say hey we're you know
[28:07] we're only talking about Bitcoin here
[28:09] for the most part but you know we give
[28:11] give everybody their two minutes to to
[28:14] chat about whatever and then we try and
[28:16] set them straight and uh get them get
[28:19] them thinking differently about those
[28:22] other uh products out there but yeah it
[28:25] absolutely is a
[28:29] I hate to see people dealing with
[28:32] altcoins and trying to uh make more
[28:36] money get rich quick kind of idea um I I
[28:40] was thinking about that earlier this
[28:43] morning actually and and I I think part
[28:46] of the
[28:48] issue for people is everybody is at
[28:51] different points in their life right and
[28:54] so if you're a 18-year-old coming coming
[28:58] out of school and you're you've got your
[29:01] first job you know maybe you're making I
[29:04] don't know $40,000 a year you're not
[29:07] making a whole lot of money you're just
[29:09] barely making enough to pay your rent
[29:11] and and buy your
[29:13] food you are going to be if you don't
[29:16] have access to savings or haven't done
[29:19] you know don't have a college fund
[29:21] whatever you're coming out of out of
[29:24] school going hey I got to I got to make
[29:27] every penny count and I'm going to buy
[29:32] you know I'm going to gamble in the
[29:34] casino in the altcoin shitcoin casino
[29:37] and see what I can come up with
[29:40] and I get that mindset for sure I was
[29:44] there once upon a time absolutely but I
[29:48] I think we all come around to seeing you
[29:51] know when you've got the single greatest
[29:55] asset commodity whatever tool whatever
[29:59] you want to call
[30:01] Bitcoin and the ability to buy any
[30:04] amount of it why wouldn't you just do
[30:07] that take your 30% 40% whatever your
[30:12] your you know your your
[30:14] annual appreciation in the
[30:18] value uh and just run with it but you
[30:22] know when if if somebody's got $500 to
[30:25] invest and somebody's got 5,000 and
[30:28] somebody's got
[30:30] 50,000 those are three different people
[30:32] looking for three different things and
[30:35] to convince somebody with $500 to buy
[30:39] Bitcoin and watch it grow over the next
[30:42] five
[30:44] years is I think a a harder sell than
[30:48] convincing the guy or gal with $50,000
[30:51] to buy half a coin and watch that grow
[30:54] because that that number looks better
[30:58] and if they've got $50,000 sitting there
[31:02] they're probably they're in a different
[31:04] place in life where where they can
[31:07] afford the the
[31:09] time into the
[31:12] future and I mean certainly the the the
[31:15] 18-year-old has plenty of well hopefully
[31:18] has plenty of time to get into the
[31:21] future um but I I think that that the
[31:25] the mindset of everybody living in Fiat
[31:28] land for their entire life is a lot
[31:31] harder to overcome I think the younger
[31:33] you are unless unless you're my kids
[31:36] right or somebody you bitcoiners kid out
[31:39] there they're hearing about it as they
[31:42] grow up they're talking about it they
[31:44] they they know all about it already so I
[31:47] don't know that
[31:50] that's you know every it's just
[31:53] everybody's in their own spot and and
[31:55] they'll get there eventually like the
[31:57] saying goes right we all we always say
[31:59] everybody gets Bitcoin at the price they
[32:01] deserve you know if if if you've got a
[32:04] lot of foresight at at 18 you may take
[32:07] that $500 and put it into the more sure
[32:11] thing than try to blow it at a casino or
[32:16] try to you know buy some whatever the
[32:19] next meme coin is and or the next five
[32:22] mean coins are and hope that you can get
[32:25] your money back out of it when it does
[32:28] go up if it goes up so I partnered up
[32:31] with coin vigilante this is the most
[32:34] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:37] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:40] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:43] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[32:46] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:49] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[32:51] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[32:55] coin vigilante just dropped a complete
[32:57] completely new and amazing Genesis
[33:00] edition of their watch collections you
[33:03] have the date of the first ever Mind
[33:06] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[33:08] also the block height and which EPO we
[33:11] are currently in I love the level of
[33:14] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[33:17] and make sure to check out those amazing
[33:20] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[33:23] descriptions I love those watches so so
[33:26] much if you watch or listen to my
[33:28] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[33:30] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[33:33] the most important step is to keep the
[33:36] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[33:39] wallet my personal recommendation for
[33:41] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[33:43] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[33:46] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[33:48] their Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[33:51] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[33:54] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss SL
[33:58] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[34:01] step is to really level up your
[34:03] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[34:06] have the most secure self- custody setup
[34:09] you have to secure your own devices you
[34:12] have to protect your privacy you have to
[34:14] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[34:17] on where you live you even want to have
[34:19] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[34:22] move in case something goes really
[34:24] really wrong and through all those steps
[34:26] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[34:29] step by step and if you visit the
[34:31] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[34:35] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[34:38] out how you can level up your
[34:41] sovereignty 100% and uh there for me
[34:44] exactly two reasons you buy Al coins um
[34:49] or use cases for alcons I would say the
[34:53] first is like gambling as you described
[34:54] it's like yeah you you I hear it so many
[34:58] times oh in altcoins to get more Bitcoin
[35:00] I'm like maybe you should be in Bitcoin
[35:02] and provide value in society maybe
[35:05] that's the better way to um but the
[35:08] second use case is interesting um
[35:10] because altcoins are uh cryptocurrencies
[35:14] they have blockchains and they can test
[35:17] things out so for me altcoins is also a
[35:21] great test net for Bitcoin we can test
[35:24] their things out in the real world
[35:28] um and see how it works and test
[35:31] different things out and maybe then see
[35:33] oh like there are some problems oh that
[35:36] would work nicely and maybe we can bring
[35:38] smaller Innovations to to bitcoin that
[35:41] is uh something that um I'm I'm open
[35:45] towards um I don't know if we have to do
[35:48] it that way I don't there can be
[35:50] different ways to tested um but uh if if
[35:55] if that's someone saying yeah like that
[35:57] Let's test it out on altcoin then why
[36:00] not bring it to bitcoin if it's
[36:02] necessary to bring it on bitcoin because
[36:04] I think most of the altcoin use cases
[36:06] are either better on bitcoin or better
[36:08] on a centralized
[36:11] database yes absolutely I mean the the
[36:15] the cost of running uh a blockchain or
[36:18] keeping a blockchain up into the long
[36:22] future is just it it it's enormous it's
[36:26] a lot and and so to try and say it's
[36:29] better in an on an altcoin
[36:32] system compared to a centralized system
[36:35] a database system it it that doesn't add
[36:38] up right in in the long term so 100% um
[36:43] but let's get back to the Bitcoin we
[36:45] talked about before about the the
[36:47] Bitcoin standard and how we're
[36:48] transitioning in there uh slowly how do
[36:51] you imagine us getting there and where
[36:55] would you say we are right now now with
[36:58] that Bitcoin
[37:00] standard yeah man I think we're really
[37:04] really early early innings yet I don't
[37:07] even know I maybe we're in the second
[37:10] inning if you're looking at a baseball
[37:11] game of of nine innings maybe we're in
[37:14] the second inning I I don't you know we
[37:17] talk about trying to you know when when
[37:20] we're crossing the chasm so to speak to
[37:23] mass adoption and I don't think we're
[37:25] close yet until
[37:28] until all of our stores are starting to
[37:31] accept Bitcoin we're not I don't think
[37:33] we're starting to cross that Chasm um I
[37:36] think we're still in the buildup phase
[37:39] um I think this year and maybe next year
[37:44] uh certainly here in the US we're going
[37:46] to see a lot more of that um you know I
[37:49] don't I have not traveled to other
[37:52] countries at this point to see how
[37:54] Bitcoin is working in Costa Rico or in
[37:58] Africa or you know other other nations
[38:01] that have a larger need for it due to
[38:04] inflation and their
[38:06] currency um
[38:09] but I think the US certainly and and
[38:13] hopefully other Western countries are
[38:15] starting to
[38:17] realize uh or recognize that there is
[38:21] this better system out there um and and
[38:25] I think with the incoming administ ation
[38:27] here in the US we're really going to see
[38:30] we're really going to see some some work
[38:34] done on that mass adoption side on on
[38:37] building the tools getting banks on
[38:40] board to you know maybe custody uh
[38:44] people's Bitcoin for them
[38:47] or what whatever that looks like I don't
[38:50] I don't know I don't you know as a
[38:52] bitcoiner I don't really like the idea
[38:54] of of Chase JP Morgan or Wells Fargo
[38:58] holding my Bitcoin I certainly wouldn't
[39:00] let them hold my Bitcoin um at at least
[39:04] not in any large quantities you know I
[39:06] look at I look at what strike's doing
[39:09] what Jack m is doing at strike and I I
[39:11] think now that is a place where I can
[39:15] leave a a working amount of
[39:18] Bitcoin that I use for monthly bills on
[39:22] a regular basis and I have more trust in
[39:25] that company and that organization than
[39:27] I do in a Chase but you know I'm also
[39:30] not naive enough to think that if the
[39:33] government said tomorrow hey strike
[39:36] you're done we're closing you down that
[39:40] there would be anything I could do to
[39:42] get my Bitcoin out of there uh F fast
[39:47] enough to beat the government right
[39:48] that's going to be shut down done
[39:50] because it's a again it's a centralized
[39:54] structure I would certainly hope that
[39:56] that doesn't everen happen and and I
[39:59] have no idea if Jack's got things built
[40:01] up in other countries backing up servers
[40:04] or whatever that information somewhere
[40:07] so that people could be made whole if if
[40:09] the US said tomorrow you're out of here
[40:12] um but
[40:14] hopefully with the administration that
[40:16] we're getting that's going to that's not
[40:19] at risk of happening I think it's the
[40:22] exact opposite I think I think Chase is
[40:26] going to come out and say hey strike
[40:28] what are you doing how are you custody
[40:30] people's Bitcoin or river what are you
[40:33] doing to custody people's Bitcoin how
[40:35] are you what systems do you have in
[40:37] place to make sure that this stuff is
[40:39] safe and and nobody that hacks our
[40:41] system is going to get
[40:43] in um do I I I don't necessarily have
[40:46] confidence that chase is going to do
[40:48] that or Wells Fargo is going to do that
[40:51] um they they may just try and come up
[40:53] with their own system they may have
[40:55] already built up that system and they're
[40:57] just waiting for the okay to turn it on
[40:59] but I think as that kind of thing
[41:02] happens then we're going to start start
[41:04] to see more retail level acceptance of
[41:08] Bitcoin um and and then we're going to
[41:11] then we're really going to hit full
[41:14] speed uh that that you know parabolic uh
[41:18] adoption cycle um you know people call
[41:22] it a super cycle whatever it is I that's
[41:27] what it's going to take that that's
[41:29] that's what we need to start seeing
[41:31] before before I feel comfortable saying
[41:34] you know we're we're at that point we've
[41:36] hit Mass adoption so yeah it's but it's
[41:40] um I I talked with um par Lew and and
[41:45] with many others also about a similar
[41:46] topic about that qually and then
[41:48] suddenly topic um and it feels like we
[41:53] are right at the beginning of that
[41:56] suddenly phase because the suddenly
[41:58] phase starts when we're just at like at
[42:01] like a few perc of adoption and it feels
[42:03] like we could be there especially if
[42:06] America actually does something now we
[42:08] we we don't know what Trump would
[42:10] actually do but we saw Michael saor with
[42:12] Eric Trump in marago uh Eric Trump is
[42:15] going to Abu Dhabi to bitcoin
[42:17] conferences like there's
[42:19] clearly um there's clearly an interest
[42:23] from them to get behind Bitcoin
[42:27] even after the election like I I saw a
[42:30] lot of things also after the election um
[42:33] will be fun to see what they actually do
[42:36] but if they do something and we can talk
[42:38] about if that's good or not for for
[42:40] Bitcoin because there also different
[42:42] opinions on that but if they do
[42:44] something that will uh enhance adoption
[42:49] and enhance the price in a whole
[42:52] different level and that might just
[42:54] trigger that that suddenly moment
[42:57] when then America does it there are all
[42:59] the other countries watching America
[43:01] like oh like they they're buying a they
[43:04] want to buy a million BDC um I think we
[43:08] should also get like a few hundred or a
[43:09] few thousand right so so that that kind
[43:12] of game theory it it feels like we're
[43:14] right at the beginning
[43:16] there yeah I I I agree it certainly
[43:20] feels like we're we're at the beginning
[43:23] I don't again I don't I feel like
[43:27] we're coming up to where that curve
[43:30] starts um maybe we're at the very
[43:33] beginning of that curve
[43:36] but again
[43:38] until until inauguration day until the
[43:43] 20th or the
[43:44] 21st uh when Trump gets
[43:47] in I if the those things don't start
[43:50] falling into place there within the next
[43:52] 100 days after that I'm I'm going to be
[43:55] a lot more hesitant um as to the speed
[43:59] you know I'm going to pull back my my
[44:01] thoughts on as to just how fast we're
[44:03] going to where we are into that curve
[44:07] right um you know I don't I was around I
[44:11] I I remember the internet and coming out
[44:14] and when people first started putting
[44:17] credit cards and making
[44:19] purchases on the internet and I can
[44:22] remember thinking and telling my buddy
[44:25] in our in our apartment that we were
[44:27] renting as I was going to college back
[44:29] in 1994 and
[44:31] 95 that I would never put my credit card
[44:34] number on the
[44:36] internet and and now I'm you know I've
[44:39] got two credit card numbers permanently
[44:41] stored in my phone for crying out loud
[44:44] and and using my Apple wallet to pay for
[44:46] things and it's just like when when that
[44:50] transition was happening I I I feel like
[44:52] that's where we're at in Bitcoin we're
[44:55] at that beginning of that transition and
[44:57] and if if the administration changes and
[45:01] and all the choke point 2.0 and 1.0 and
[45:05] all of that crap goes away um and
[45:09] businesses are are encouraged to utilize
[45:12] this or at least just freed to do it and
[45:17] not have to worry about being you know
[45:20] uh thed or penalized or something for
[45:23] using it then then yes then we're there
[45:27] then we're there and then it's all bets
[45:30] are off We're Off to the Races this
[45:32] thing is
[45:34] going I don't I mean it will become
[45:37] utilized by every single person on the
[45:40] planet it just it it it's and it will do
[45:44] that in a manner that was quicker than
[45:47] what happened with the internet all you
[45:50] you're lucky enough to live through the
[45:52] internet adoption I I was just born in
[45:55] 1998 so I didn't uh really
[45:57] got got to see a lot of that um when
[46:01] bubble was I was like one and a half
[46:03] years old so oh boy yeah yeah I was I
[46:07] was right there for all of it and
[46:09] watched it all and and kicked myself
[46:12] every day into the early
[46:14] 2000s because I didn't pay more
[46:17] attention to it and I didn't focus more
[46:18] of my time on it so how would you
[46:21] compare the internet adoption and the
[46:24] Bitcoin adoption now do do um do you see
[46:27] some similarities do you see something
[46:29] that is completely
[46:32] different yeah I I see a lot of
[46:34] similarities I a lot of the same ideas a
[46:38] lot of the same thoughts of you the the
[46:42] the people in the old system right that
[46:47] you know the the the library and the
[46:49] encyclopedia brittanica people you know
[46:52] spreading the fud about how you need the
[46:55] written word and you need books and blah
[46:58] blah blah and you and and then people
[47:02] espousing the the productivity gains and
[47:05] the benefits of the internet and having
[47:07] knowledge that not the ability to allow
[47:10] everybody on the planet to have access
[47:13] to this shared system where they can
[47:16] basically get anything at the tips of
[47:19] their fingers I mean that that's a lot
[47:23] how I see Bitcoin um where every body
[47:27] will have access to a monetary system
[47:31] that is
[47:33] immutable decentralized uncontrolled by
[47:36] anybody
[47:37] and uh open open and permissionless for
[47:41] everybody to use at the tips of their
[47:44] fingers and and I I can't see how that
[47:47] isn't a better world and isn't a better
[47:49] system interesting I I yeah I do you so
[47:54] so libr libr libraries were fighting
[47:59] against internet because obviously it it
[48:02] it threatened their business
[48:04] model absolutely absolutely the
[48:08] especially the the private libraries
[48:10] your law libraries and and every
[48:12] everybody that kept information it's
[48:14] it's that idea of having that stored
[48:17] Silo of information that um you know has
[48:21] has led to all the productiv not all but
[48:24] so many productivity gains in in human
[48:28] history right I mean the first printing
[48:31] press allowed
[48:32] information to be spread now it was the
[48:36] Bible right a lot a lot of it was the
[48:38] Bible and um we can argue whether or not
[48:41] that was good information or or you know
[48:44] lawful in whatever just information but
[48:47] it was information that was able to be
[48:50] spread to so many more people rather
[48:53] than having to hire a bunch of people to
[48:57] and hand copy books one page at a time
[49:01] and then trying to spread those around
[49:03] the world
[49:04] so it that the the internet did that for
[49:09] all the in all the information and and
[49:12] access to all the sales and all the
[49:14] stores and all the all the schools and
[49:17] and now as as we've built layers upon
[49:21] the internet were able to you know dig
[49:25] in further and and provide that
[49:27] information to people at low or no cost
[49:31] in some aspects you know look at what
[49:35] Michael sailor's doing right with uh
[49:37] hope.org and sailor uh his Academy um
[49:42] you know it's I I look at my kids who
[49:46] are seven and almost six now and I
[49:49] think I think I think their college will
[49:53] be online and free like that information
[49:57] will just be there or it'll be very
[49:58] close to free they will have access and
[50:02] hopefully the time to dedicate to
[50:06] learning whatever the heck it is they
[50:08] want to learn to make Humanity better to
[50:11] make to to en encourage and promote the
[50:17] understanding of whatever it is that
[50:20] interests them whatever the Sciences
[50:23] math you whatever it is astronomy you
[50:27] name it theology whatever they will my
[50:32] hope is through adoption of Bitcoin that
[50:35] they're going to have the time available
[50:37] instead of having to spend time working
[50:39] to pay a bill they're going to have the
[50:41] time available to them to study the
[50:44] things that interest them at lower no
[50:46] cost which will just make the entire
[50:49] world a better place so I just wanted to
[50:53] bring that up it's it's sail.org yeah uh
[50:57] which is absolutely amazing they also
[50:58] have a great Bitcoin course on there um
[51:02] I think I think when we
[51:06] google.org Bitcoin course we probably
[51:09] come there uh yeah Bitcoin for everybody
[51:12] it's called s do learn uh that's a great
[51:14] one I didn't do it till now uh fully I
[51:18] skipped through it uh and uh I think it
[51:21] did the first unit uh fully but like six
[51:24] unit or something like that it's really
[51:26] good yeah and yeah like hope.com I
[51:29] celebrate it so much that hope.com is a
[51:34] Bitcoin
[51:35] website like that that that alone is
[51:39] such a great thing and uh just I'm I'm
[51:43] too proud of that but uh if you go to
[51:46] interviews there's my channel so I I
[51:50] really love Yeah there there you go that
[51:53] Z was on the on the on the show because
[51:55] that website learned a lot I just like
[51:58] went here and watched all the videos and
[52:01] now it's like it's crazy for me to to
[52:03] see my own video here um but yeah it's
[52:07] it's really interesting to see uh what
[52:10] what the uh how Bitcoin already evolved
[52:14] that we have hope.com uh on on our side
[52:17] like hope.com is is a Bitcoin
[52:21] website yeah yeah absolutely and and
[52:24] it's an educational website and it's all
[52:27] free I mean that's that's the killer
[52:30] thing man is is and Jeff Booth talks
[52:34] about it right every uh what does he say
[52:37] the uh free market is deflationary Right
[52:40] everything should continue to cost less
[52:44] as we go through life and we as humans
[52:49] we have never lived in that system up
[52:52] until January 3rd of 2009 right that's
[52:56] that's when we figured out that that is
[52:59] a system that we now have access to um
[53:03] and we are all coming to that
[53:05] realization and we're all making those
[53:07] connections in our brains at our at our
[53:10] own
[53:11] speed um and it is so hopeful and and so
[53:18] I'm so optimistic of the
[53:20] future because of this new system of
[53:25] money and and this new ability that we
[53:28] have to allow us all to to work in
[53:31] benefit in cooperation with each other
[53:34] instead of against each other instead of
[53:37] trying to extract from each
[53:39] other 100% it really I yeah yeah I I had
[53:44] a earlier this week sorry I'm gonna go
[53:46] off on a little tangent here but you
[53:48] know I had a conversation with a buddy
[53:50] of mine who you know I've been talking
[53:51] to about Bitcoin now for a couple of
[53:54] years and he works in the tech IND
[53:56] industry you know he makes a pretty good
[53:58] salary but you know he's uh just this
[54:02] past week and uh Wednesday it was he was
[54:06] telling me you know how how upset he is
[54:09] and pessimistic he is about the future
[54:12] and how he's living paycheck to paycheck
[54:15] you know and this is a guy I've known
[54:16] now for 25 years uh and again he's
[54:22] making a very good salary and he's
[54:24] living paycheck to paycheck and it it
[54:27] just he's so stressed and I could just
[54:29] hear it in his voice and you know and
[54:31] and I'm sitting there trying
[54:33] to uh temper my optimism because I feel
[54:37] a little bad about being so optimistic
[54:39] about the future but doing all I can to
[54:42] help him down his journey uh and
[54:46] hopefully come to the realization that
[54:50] that you know Bitcoin is going to help
[54:52] him if he starts to utilize that system
[54:58] so and it just it it's you know it it's
[55:03] a little heartbreaking to to see that in
[55:06] him and then to think about how many
[55:09] people like I think in for us in Bitcoin
[55:12] we get a little we're in a little bit of
[55:15] a bubble and we get a little
[55:17] desensitized maybe to some of the
[55:20] struggles of the average everyday person
[55:24] walking through life and and it
[55:27] really It's just tough and and we got to
[55:31] get I this is why I like what I'm doing
[55:35] with my resident is I I think we need to
[55:40] incentivize everybody out there to be to
[55:44] see the benefit of Bitcoin you know it
[55:47] it they don't have to my resident
[55:49] doesn't have to save in
[55:51] Bitcoin themselves personally to see a
[55:54] benefit from using the Bitcoin system
[55:57] they just have to pay me in Bitcoin and
[55:59] they get to see that Savings in their
[56:04] Fiat
[56:05] World
[56:07] eventually that my hope is that that
[56:10] will click in some of their heads as it
[56:13] did with my you know Kyle my renter that
[56:16] is paying that way sorry to bring it all
[56:17] back this way but um you know he it has
[56:20] now clicked to him that if he keeps
[56:23] buying Bitcoin as he pays me in the
[56:25] future
[56:26] it it's going to cost him less even even
[56:31] less uh than if he just buys it the
[56:35] month that he pays it to me right so
[56:39] because now he recognizes the the value
[56:43] appreciation himself in his Bitcoin
[56:45] Holdings and then he pays me in Bitcoin
[56:48] and gets to recognize that appreciation
[56:51] as well
[56:54] so it's uh reminds me of
[56:57] this how should I say that
[57:01] uh everyone who is experiencing Bitcoin
[57:05] will be a bitcoiner at some point
[57:08] because it's such a superior technology
[57:11] that you can not not see it if you
[57:15] actually experience it yourself uh
[57:17] that's why I find it very cool that you
[57:21] I did it the same way with with my my
[57:24] sister we had that small deal she
[57:26] doesn't want to do to invest in Bitcoin
[57:28] she's like oh I'm scared of that and I'm
[57:30] like okay um you just give me uh the
[57:33] money I will invest it for you and I
[57:36] guarantee you I will get give you the
[57:38] money back plus uh interest rates that's
[57:41] like my proudly uh my my promise as a PR
[57:46] to you and we made it over like four or
[57:48] five years uh and I said to her
[57:52] additionally uh additionally do the
[57:54] interest that that you get will also
[57:56] give you a share of the uh appreciation
[58:00] that we are doing so I took away all her
[58:03] risk to the downside and gave her some
[58:06] portion of the upside um and over four
[58:09] years she saw like what like that that
[58:12] happened with my money like crazy so you
[58:17] you you have to let people into the
[58:21] experience so they can actually see for
[58:24] their own eyes how amazing it is it took
[58:26] me a while to get the med of exchange
[58:29] sides of things of Bitcoin it took me
[58:31] actually till I had the podcast till I
[58:33] actually had to deal with Bitcoin uh
[58:36] transactions now I have with coin
[58:38] vigilante an American sponsor uh I'm in
[58:41] Europe Bank transfers are not easy uh
[58:44] you need Bank numbers you need numbers
[58:46] that are not available on the online
[58:48] banking you have to call you have to
[58:50] deal with that stuff uh you have to pay
[58:52] fees and all that BS I didn't want to do
[58:56] that I said hey let's do it in Bitcoin
[58:58] like that's a it doesn't matter where
[59:01] you are when you're in Bitcoin we just
[59:03] did it in Bitcoin and I was like Sunday
[59:06] evening I just sent him the invoice and
[59:09] he said like oh I will directly pay it
[59:12] uh and like 20 minutes after I sent the
[59:15] invoice the money was already in my
[59:17] wallet it didn't had to go through like
[59:19] five business days of Bank uh transfers
[59:23] and then go one business day to my
[59:25] brogress account and then I buy Bitcoin
[59:28] with that and then like oh it needs from
[59:30] the broker another few minutes to my
[59:33] self custody wallet it's like directly
[59:36] where I wanted to have it so sorry for
[59:39] my small attention now but like the
[59:41] power of Bitcoin you have to see for
[59:43] your own eyes and experience it in that
[59:46] way yep yep yeah yeah I'm I I just
[59:50] recently came got a story similar uh not
[59:54] not where I'm receiving the funds but
[59:56] I'm actually sending funds so this whole
[60:00] uh 50/50 appreciation split idea I'm I'm
[60:04] trying to work on developing an app for
[60:07] it so that um between my renter and I at
[60:11] least we can just plug in the numbers
[60:14] and we can see the information that was
[60:17] on that Excel spreadsh spreadsheet that
[60:20] you shared um we can just see that
[60:24] recorded right in and app in a in a
[60:27] database basically um and so I'm working
[60:30] with a developer who happens to live in
[60:33] Australia um to put that App together
[60:37] and you know I'm sending him Bitcoin in
[60:40] order to do that and you know it was the
[60:42] same thing it you know it it was a
[60:44] Wednesday I think but instead of going
[60:47] through a bank and trying to send him
[60:48] cash and into whatever he needed it
[60:52] transferred into it was just hey just
[60:55] give me a Bitcoin address and I'll send
[60:58] you the first payment and you can get
[61:01] working on this thing so um and it you
[61:04] know 20 minutes later he got he got the
[61:07] we got the confirmation and he said yep
[61:09] we're we're good to go so and and you
[61:12] know he's 16 hours ahead in the future I
[61:14] always joke with him that he's you know
[61:17] living in the future and um you know but
[61:20] it's it's awesome I mean when when the
[61:22] technology works and it and it cost me
[61:24] like two bucks to send it to them you
[61:26] know and it's just I mean it's just
[61:29] mindboggling to to everybody it should
[61:32] be mind-boggling to everybody anyway
[61:34] unless you've done it
[61:35] regularly uh that the system works and
[61:38] and it works so smoothly and fast if you
[61:41] need it fast and uh efficiently if you
[61:45] need it more efficiently so absolutely
[61:48] when you uh encounter all of that what
[61:51] we just talked about and compare it
[61:53] again to to the internet adoption what
[61:56] year would you say we are like are we
[61:59] right in front of the bubble or like a
[62:01] little bit
[62:03] earlier yeah I I think we're we're
[62:05] earlier than the dot bubble for sure um
[62:08] we're we're at the beginning of
[62:11] accepting payments over the Internet
[62:14] we're like accepting credit cards over
[62:16] the internet right now is what what I
[62:18] think just the very beginning of that
[62:21] too so um where you know it's so it's
[62:24] like maybe
[62:26] 1990 91 maybe um where I'm not sure
[62:32] exactly I'm sure the first payment was
[62:33] probably late 80s or mid 80s um but for
[62:38] me at my age I I I remember the payment
[62:42] issue coming up at like 91
[62:45] 92
[62:47] um maybe even 93
[62:50] so and and that's when you know I was
[62:53] like uhuh that's not that's not going to
[62:56] happened um and obviously I was
[62:59] completely wrong about that so yeah it
[63:02] says uh it was widely recognized the
[63:05] first time
[63:07] 1994
[63:09] seemingly but yeah it was like uh a
[63:12] sting CD for
[63:15] $12 over the platform called net Market
[63:19] real really cool net Market Nice never
[63:22] heard about those
[63:24] things no
[63:26] I I never heard about net Market myself
[63:28] I I don't remember that site uh you know
[63:32] like I said I I wasn't looking into it I
[63:34] didn't I didn't trust it at that time
[63:36] and so I wasn't digging into all of that
[63:38] but um you know I think when did Amazon
[63:42] first come on board I don't I don't
[63:45] there were companies before Amazon
[63:46] though that were taking payments I think
[63:49] um oh gosh I can't even remember there
[63:51] was a
[63:52] big uh like a CD uh store that sold you
[63:58] know CD discs in in the in the mall
[64:01] everywhere and I think they started
[64:04] accepting online
[64:06] payments uh sometime around 93 994 um
[64:11] maybe even
[64:12] 95 um you know and that was too much for
[64:16] me I couldn't I couldn't deal with that
[64:18] at that point but it's interesting it's
[64:21] it's really it it shows uh how how fast
[64:27] this whole thing went and how far we
[64:29] will go with Bitcoin is is is the lesson
[64:33] that you were biting your ass for
[64:36] internet adoption kind of why you got
[64:38] maybe earlier now into
[64:40] Bitcoin I think so yeah I think that
[64:43] really played a role in in my thinking
[64:45] and and you
[64:47] know having focused a lot of my
[64:50] attention
[64:51] on why I missed the internet and what
[64:56] you know for a long time I kept trying
[64:58] to think of how can I develop uh a
[65:01] company online what can I do to to still
[65:05] get to be a part of this you know I I
[65:08] was thinking that even into the 200s and
[65:12] two thou I I can remember in I think it
[65:14] was
[65:15] 2004 I I had this idea for like a
[65:19] software package for property management
[65:21] I was already working in property
[65:23] management at that time but it it
[65:26] was man I this this could go on for a
[65:29] while so stop me if I get too long-
[65:32] winded here um but I I had this idea in
[65:35] my head that people could log into your
[65:37] website and take a 3D tour of your
[65:41] apartment before you rented it and rent
[65:43] it fill out the application and rent it
[65:45] right online do everything and you know
[65:48] turns out that was maybe 15 years too
[65:51] early because now you can do that right
[65:55] in 2020 you could do that you could go
[65:57] on to some of these company larger
[65:59] companies websites and you could take a
[66:02] 3D tour of the apartment that you were
[66:04] going to rent and and you could see
[66:06] where in the building there were vacant
[66:08] apartments and and click on the
[66:10] apartment you wanted and fill out the
[66:12] application so it it uh you know
[66:17] it's obviously it for me at that point
[66:20] in my
[66:22] life the timing wasn't right I couldn't
[66:24] I couldn't
[66:26] take the time to develop that uh that
[66:29] software that
[66:30] site uh all the information that was
[66:33] needed and there were already companies
[66:36] out there software companies out there
[66:39] that were developing this software
[66:41] technology for these larger property
[66:43] management companies and so you know it
[66:46] just I could see it coming but I knew I
[66:50] I knew the amount of effort to put in
[66:52] the amount of time to put in was just
[66:54] not in the cards for me at that point in
[66:57] my life so um Bitcoin really came around
[67:01] at at the right time more or less I mean
[67:04] I like I said I I first saw Bitcoin back
[67:06] in like 2013 2014 and didn't do anything
[67:09] with it until 2020 really but um you
[67:12] know now now it's just the right time in
[67:14] my life I've I've gotten the time to
[67:16] develop to dig into to really think
[67:20] critically about what what the future is
[67:22] going to bring on on this protocol
[67:26] and how those layers are going to look
[67:28] and what we can do and I I'm so excited
[67:31] I mean I I I hope to be uh you know this
[67:36] this app that I'm working
[67:38] on I hope that that'll be able to it's
[67:41] going to be all free open- source
[67:43] software it's going to be uh Noster
[67:46] based so it's going to be completely uh
[67:51] uh private you know I mean you you'll
[67:54] have your UB and and your nsec and
[67:57] you'll be able to sign in and hopefully
[68:00] interact with any any retail chain out
[68:05] there any any business out there and be
[68:08] able to enter into these agreements with
[68:10] them if they know about the the software
[68:14] if they know about the app and and want
[68:17] to do it so hopefully that'll help push
[68:21] more usage of Bitcoin um and help enable
[68:25] more people to understand Bitcoin and
[68:27] and get to get that initial interaction
[68:31] with it and uh yeah go from there see
[68:34] see what see what the future brings man
[68:37] I I think man I we could talk about
[68:40] Fetti I or eash I I think uh you know
[68:44] I'm I'm I'm trying to picture in my head
[68:47] like putting together a a bank um for
[68:52] just my residence just my buildings and
[68:55] then for my Company the company that I
[68:57] work for having a bank that you know all
[68:59] all of our residents can uh make
[69:03] payments now through ecash um you know
[69:07] that way they're completely private and
[69:09] and have that tie in with this uh app
[69:12] and and the sharing and the value
[69:14] appreciation of Bitcoin and um yeah I I
[69:19] I think it'll come in good time it's
[69:21] just going to take some time so
[69:23] absolutely you will you will need some
[69:24] time to available all those things um
[69:27] but yeah how do you think because we
[69:29] talked about fetty uh fetty mint and and
[69:32] those those things um how do you think
[69:34] that ninth inning that Bitcoin standard
[69:37] uh looks like how do you imagine
[69:41] that yeah I you know bitcoin's the base
[69:45] protocol right the base layer of all of
[69:49] these other layers built on top of it
[69:51] and so I
[69:53] think I I think fed mints and ecash the
[69:57] these mints are a little bit ahead of
[70:00] their time um certainly for the people
[70:03] that value privacy right now
[70:06] 100% uh it makes sense for um I think as
[70:13] Bitcoin
[70:14] utilization grows and more people come
[70:17] to understand that it's going to be
[70:20] easier for people to interact with these
[70:24] mints and and exchange value and feel
[70:27] more trust that that mint is going to be
[70:30] there for the long term I I almost think
[70:33] that like instead of a JP Morgan Chase
[70:36] Bank you're going to have a JP Morgan
[70:38] Chase mint and people are going to
[70:42] interact with that mint that will be the
[70:46] long-term holder and and balancer of
[70:51] that mint now you know how that how
[70:55] exactly that operates it may it may
[70:58] operate for you know a month at a time
[71:00] it may operate for a year at a time um
[71:05] and and then people have to move their
[71:07] funds to another mint so to speak it it
[71:10] would still be you know whoever that
[71:13] organized that mint JP Morgan or
[71:16] whatever you know or the Jason haino
[71:19] mint kind of a thing but um you know we
[71:24] I think there will have to be some
[71:25] checks and balances there to ensure that
[71:27] the the mint holder the people that are
[71:29] in control
[71:31] aren't
[71:33] uh selling paper Bitcoin basically or
[71:36] paper paper ecash so love it I I mean
[71:42] there really like the more we go up the
[71:46] the layers the more we have to be
[71:49] careful of those applications and mins
[71:51] and stuff like that because uh if for
[71:55] example if you have Bitcoin on wallet of
[71:58] Satoshi on layer
[72:01] 2 they can get those Bitcoin like
[72:04] they're not really it's it's custodial
[72:07] you don't have the keys to that stuff
[72:09] like that so uh I think a lot of
[72:11] bitcoiners are not aware of those small
[72:14] things to consider I personally like to
[72:16] use wallet of Satoshi um just because
[72:20] the highest amount I ever have there is
[72:22] like $50 maybe $100 if it comes out
[72:26] um so I don't really use it for big
[72:29] amounts so if they rock my $50 it's fine
[72:33] with me uh they're providing a good
[72:36] service that $50 they deserve
[72:38] even uh so that's that's that's how I
[72:42] see it um but it will be fun to
[72:45] see how that massive influx of money
[72:49] that comes now into Bitcoin will then
[72:51] develop all those apps and and layers on
[72:54] top of of Bitcoin yeah do you have a do
[72:58] you have an highlight of of the past
[73:01] year that I think it's now eight nine
[73:03] months that we recorded the last episode
[73:05] something like that um a lot of things
[73:09] happened in between it was like a it was
[73:12] a fast year um absolutely or did maybe
[73:16] even your understanding of of Bitcoin
[73:18] change in that that Ram or did you take
[73:21] any highlights from
[73:23] there yeah I mean I think um you know
[73:27] certainly a highlight for me is just
[73:29] seeing that this concept that I've got
[73:32] for Bitcoin and the sharing of the
[73:35] appreciation isn't wrecking me as the
[73:39] number goes up and it isn't wrecking my
[73:42] resident as the number goes up or down I
[73:45] mean I I think that spreadsheet showed
[73:47] you know there were there was one or two
[73:49] months where the the Bitcoin that he had
[73:52] purchased and paid 6 months prior was
[73:56] actually valued less at those on those
[73:59] two months than it was previously and so
[74:03] you know he didn't you know that was
[74:05] that was my holding as a business
[74:07] operator that that was my risk on the
[74:10] downside of you know taking that right
[74:14] taking that on for myself um but seeing
[74:18] that that worked that was certainly that
[74:21] that it's continuing to work here that's
[74:23] certainly a highlight for me I I think
[74:25] that that just
[74:27] reinforces my mind that Bitcoin and
[74:31] businesses built on this protocol are
[74:34] going to be more more beneficial to more
[74:38] people and will strengthen the network
[74:43] overall
[74:44] versus people that are out there running
[74:47] businesses calling themselves Bitcoin
[74:50] businesses but doing things kind of the
[74:53] old Fiat mindset way
[74:56] so um certainly uh the information of
[75:02] trump and getting him getting elected
[75:04] and all the you know 200 some other uh
[75:09] government uh uh employees so to speak
[75:15] uh that are bitcoiners getting elected
[75:17] to office uh through the the November
[75:20] election was certainly promising um you
[75:24] know I I that that helps solidify with
[75:27] to me this idea that you know we're
[75:30] winning I mean we are we are at it it's
[75:34] it starts with getting as many people to
[75:39] understand Bitcoin as possible and and
[75:42] then those people get into positions of
[75:44] power as time goes on and and it just it
[75:48] is just
[75:50] a I I I hate to say inevitability
[75:55] but it certainly feels like it is an
[75:59] inevitability I I mean when when my the
[76:04] my Bitcoin business is operating and it
[76:07] is working and then people are getting
[76:10] elected to position the power to make
[76:14] everybody who's running Bitcoin
[76:17] businesses uh lives easier and better
[76:21] and maybe even encouraging people to
[76:23] operate Bitcoin business businesses and
[76:25] and operate on a Bitcoin standard it
[76:29] is it is no I I don't know that I can be
[76:33] bullish enough about that I mean it just
[76:36] everything all these transitions take
[76:38] time you know the the internet didn't
[76:41] happen in a day it didn't grow in a day
[76:43] credit cards weren't widely accepted and
[76:45] widely used on the Internet by people
[76:48] for almost well you said 94 to 2000 was
[76:52] the dot bubble right so that's six
[76:55] years I if if I look at we're we're at
[76:59] that point in Bitcoin right now in four
[77:03] years three years because we're adopting
[77:06] Bitcoin faster than we were the
[77:09] internet it it's just it blows my mind
[77:13] to even try and imagine what three years
[77:16] from now looks like even what the end of
[77:19] this year is going to look like man I
[77:21] mean you said it last year was a
[77:23] mindblower from you know eight months
[77:26] ago when we talked in I think it was
[77:28] April or maybe yeah somewhere back there
[77:31] March April at to now I mean it just is
[77:35] the world the landscape is completely
[77:38] different and it is so
[77:40] much stronger and positive for
[77:43] Bitcoin that I I cannot see how anybody
[77:47] would fight this how anybody will not
[77:51] not how they'll fight it but how they
[77:53] will win that fight right I I I don't
[77:56] nobody can win this fight that they're
[77:59] they can dig in their heels they can try
[78:00] to stop it they can try to you know ban
[78:03] it they can try to do whatever but they
[78:05] are going to
[78:07] lose when more people see the benefits
[78:12] of the system working than
[78:17] that
[78:19] interesting I I
[78:23] think does that make yeah AB absolutely
[78:26] and and I think we at that that very
[78:29] crossroad that you are talking about uh
[78:32] where when the the more people that see
[78:35] it uh the the more people then
[78:38] afterwards also see it like it's kind of
[78:41] like a self-fulfilling prophecy at that
[78:43] point um even even the people that hate
[78:47] on bitcoin right
[78:48] now kind of play in bitcoin's cards um
[78:54] because the talk about it they make
[78:56] other people aware of Bitcoin um I told
[78:59] that story I think in the very beginning
[79:01] of of of some episodes of the podcast I
[79:04] had in my old University a professor
[79:07] that hated on bitcoin a lot and he was
[79:12] it security and he started his it
[79:16] security um Les uh lectures
[79:20] always um like this the first lecture of
[79:23] his course all with hating on bitcoin at
[79:26] some point in the lecture of his like
[79:28] two three hour lecture and uh this is
[79:32] the marketing that Bitcoin needs like he
[79:35] he does the job he orange billing people
[79:37] he's like hey Bitcoin is bad from the
[79:40] environment and it's like okay but
[79:43] shouldn't you talk about it security
[79:45] like uh why you are making us aware of
[79:49] of Bitcoin so um obviously there the
[79:52] that it's bad marketing but still
[79:55] marketing and you you if you throw uh uh
[80:00] petrol like Benzene like something like
[80:02] on a fire you just make it bigger and
[80:05] that's what the haters on bitcoin are
[80:06] doing they're talking about it and
[80:09] they're making it bigger they the worst
[80:11] thing that can happen is everyone
[80:13] ignores it and nobody cares about
[80:16] it but yeah but hating on it it just
[80:20] makes it uh bigger than that it's it
[80:22] gives it gives it air it gives it
[80:24] something the pre file it gives it more
[80:26] volume um but yeah um do you expect
[80:30] anything for 2095 on on that note is
[80:33] there anything that you're looking
[80:34] forward
[80:36] to man I'm looking I'm looking forward
[80:39] to the entire year I I can't wait I I
[80:43] think uh the lightning Layer Two fent if
[80:49] you want to call that layer two and a
[80:50] half or three um I am looking forward to
[80:54] learning more about that uh and and
[80:58] getting um getting getting my mind
[81:02] wrapped around how to make uh those
[81:05] payments and and those systems work I
[81:07] really want to I want to start a mint uh
[81:11] in
[81:12] 2025
[81:13] um uh what else man I I mean the
[81:18] administration in the US coming into
[81:21] play I'm looking forward to that I'm
[81:23] looking forward to more information
[81:27] coming out um on you know Miners and and
[81:32] benefiting the electric grids around the
[81:35] world not just in the US but you know
[81:38] the the the the idea when I sit and
[81:43] think about like the the continent of
[81:46] Africa right and think that I don't some
[81:49] large percentage of the population there
[81:52] don't have access to
[81:55] electricity on a steady and reliable
[81:58] regular basis um it blows my mind that
[82:02] there that that we don't have the
[82:05] infrastructure built up for that um and
[82:08] I I see how Bitcoin mining can play a
[82:15] role in providing steady
[82:18] electricity to all of those countries
[82:22] and small towns and villages and
[82:25] whatever and and just I mean just the
[82:29] Improvement in people's lives that can
[82:33] come as a result of that is I mean it's
[82:36] just mindboggling to me I mean we we we
[82:40] are we're all so
[82:43] privileged to live with regular
[82:46] electricity and running water and
[82:48] Refrigeration on a regular
[82:51] basis that we at least for me I lose
[82:55] track of the people that don't and
[83:00] and I I just I I I just look forward to
[83:04] it man I I just think
[83:07] it it makes me want to do everything I
[83:10] can to try and promote that and try to
[83:14] benefit all of those people that don't
[83:17] have that access I mean and it's not
[83:19] just on on the continent of Africa right
[83:22] it's all around the world where people
[83:24] don't have this access um but the
[83:28] numbers are just staggering
[83:31] and the benefit is just it it I it's
[83:38] like trying to picture a trillion
[83:40] dollars right I mean we can talk about
[83:43] it all day but unless you really try and
[83:46] sit down and really really wrap your
[83:48] head around that it's just this kind
[83:52] of concept
[83:54] that is it yeah you think it's big but
[83:57] you just don't realize how big it is or
[83:59] like space you know it's like you just
[84:02] you don't realize the distance between
[84:04] here and the Sun is however many
[84:06] millions of miles it is and it literally
[84:10] it it's so
[84:12] big the ability
[84:14] to provide people regular electricity is
[84:19] like I I mean the life and death life
[84:23] and death difference I I mean it just
[84:26] the the the the people can benefit so
[84:30] much and and the mind power that is
[84:32] there that is you know focused on simply
[84:36] surviving for the day versus focused on
[84:40] trying to solve our really hard problems
[84:43] with Humanity uh or with science or
[84:46] whatever there are there there's so much
[84:51] untapped
[84:53] potential that think Bitcoin helps bring
[84:55] us to that I I just I look forward to
[84:58] watching the network grow and seeing all
[85:00] of this happen I yes it's not going to
[85:03] all just happen next year but based on
[85:05] based on how the internet and Adoption
[85:07] of that went I it's going to it's going
[85:10] to blow our minds I I couldn't uh I
[85:14] couldn't put it in a in a better context
[85:15] that was really good I L it um yeah but
[85:18] uh we're already at almost one and a
[85:21] half hours it
[85:22] always gets longer with if you love it
[85:25] sorry hey I'm good I'm I'm good to keep
[85:28] going man but let's keep going I
[85:30] don't all right man I have I have a few
[85:33] more questions uh and a few more things
[85:35] that that uh I want to talk to you um I
[85:38] don't know if I already did that when we
[85:41] I have now a new question that I asked
[85:43] each and every one of my guests and I
[85:45] don't know if I already did it last time
[85:47] with you I think not um I don't think is
[85:51] the question is what can we learn from
[85:53] you beside it's
[85:57] Bitcoin yeah
[86:00] um I I mean I don't
[86:05] I have trouble um tooting my own horn so
[86:09] to speak um I
[86:14] think one thing that I focus on in my
[86:18] life is is trying to be present in the
[86:22] moment right and so um if I can if I
[86:29] can get anybody
[86:32] to be a little more present in the
[86:35] moment I I think or or to remember to
[86:38] try and be focused on what's going on in
[86:41] front of you right now at the present
[86:42] moment in time um I I think the world
[86:47] would be a better place than everybody
[86:50] focusing on things that happened in the
[86:52] past and trying to you know
[86:55] change the future necessarily I mean
[86:58] there there certainly is you got to
[87:00] manifest your future and make it what
[87:02] you want it to be but if you're
[87:04] not doing good in the
[87:07] present um and doing the right thing in
[87:10] the present um you're you're not going
[87:13] to you're you're not going to have good
[87:15] production in the future into the future
[87:19] so absolutely it's like uh the the
[87:22] actions you take today will impact your
[87:24] life in like a few months or years yeah
[87:27] like that's uh that that that's the
[87:30] that's the thing really cool um we have
[87:32] end routine that I definitely had
[87:34] already last time you were on uh where
[87:36] the previous guest is asking a question
[87:38] for the next guest without knowing who
[87:40] the next guest actually is and your
[87:42] question from the previous guest is what
[87:44] are the ways Bitcoin has improved your
[87:46] life both directly and
[87:51] indirectly
[87:52] yeah uh so many ways I I think
[87:57] it's almost difficult to put uh
[88:04] any set terms into that um you know in
[88:09] indirectly it's given me even more hope
[88:13] and and more
[88:15] um POS a more positive outlook to the
[88:19] Future and and what is
[88:21] coming um
[88:25] directly I mean you know certainly
[88:28] making my life easier to afford
[88:31] certainly making my life easier to live
[88:34] uh has been huge certainly making my
[88:37] life with my residence in in my business
[88:41] being able to it it it's enabled me
[88:45] to remove myself not completely but to
[88:49] at least begin to extract myself from
[88:52] that extractive model where I'm not
[88:55] trying
[88:56] to you know increase the rent for my
[89:01] residents every single year to ensure
[89:07] that you know myself and my family have
[89:10] the future that we need I'm I'm building
[89:12] the future that we need and and not so
[89:15] focused anymore
[89:17] on that extractive business model so
[89:21] that that really is just makes
[89:25] I just I just feel so much better when I
[89:27] talk to my residents and I can look at
[89:29] them in the eye and be like hey man
[89:31] how's it going like and
[89:34] really not not be focused on hey what
[89:37] are you doing to my apartment that I'm
[89:39] going to have to fix when you move out I
[89:42] get to focus on them as an individual
[89:44] and how they're living their life and
[89:46] what I can do to try and help them be
[89:49] better live better understand something
[89:51] more stuff like that so when when I talk
[89:54] to you I always feel like I want a
[89:56] better
[89:58] [Laughter]
