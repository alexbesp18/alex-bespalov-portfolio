[00:00] chances like Bitcoin honestly come once
[00:02] in a lifetime whatever age I want to
[00:04] retire at Bitcoin is going to be my
[00:05] retirement young people listen to their
[00:07] parents and parents are stuck in their
[00:09] old ways and their old Financial system
[00:12] I work every single day and it's so
[00:14] important to preserve your energy and
[00:17] save it in something that's going to
[00:19] keep the same value or even more value
[00:21] over time you go to school you pass your
[00:23] gccs you do your A Levels you go to
[00:26] university get a job get a mortgage have
[00:28] a family live your life and die Bitcoin
[00:30] was designed as a financial system to
[00:33] help people it's not there to come for
[00:35] you or attack you it's only there to
[00:37] help you and it's your choice as a
[00:39] person whether you use that or not if
[00:40] you look at a current fat system oh my
[00:43] God it's literally controlled by the
[00:44] government and that's why it's so
[00:45] corrupt because they can do whatever
[00:47] they like with it they're like dangling
[00:49] a bit of string and we're chasing after
[00:51] their dream even if the whole internet
[00:53] in the world shut down and someone's
[00:55] going to power up the next day Bitcoin
[00:57] is still there you know your energy is
[01:00] still preserved there's no way in chance
[01:02] I'm ever going to buy a house I don't
[01:04] want to like risk my freedom for a
[01:06] mortgage I have to pay off for the rest
[01:08] of my life till like I'm 80 that 10% is
[01:11] going to be your retirement so from the
[01:13] beginning I've always looked at Bitcoin
[01:15] as a source of retirement if you're ever
[01:17] going to dream of anything is to always
[01:19] be
[01:20] [Music]
[01:23] healthy hi how you doing everything fine
[01:26] on your end hello Robin thank you for
[01:28] having me on your podcast it's all
[01:30] really good I can't wait to speak about
[01:32] Bitcoin and also congratulations to you
[01:35] and on your podcast cuz
[01:37] 365 days is crazy and there's only a
[01:41] limited amount of people currently in
[01:44] the world that are actually fully into
[01:46] Bitcoin and you only really see that
[01:48] when you go to bitcoin conferences so
[01:50] the fact that you've got a guest for
[01:52] each one is just yeah really cool so
[01:54] congratulations oh yeah thank you it's
[01:57] it's so much it's so cool because like
[01:59] the the community
[02:00] is actually it's a really small
[02:02] community but I guess it's it's bigger
[02:05] than I thought because the the biggest
[02:07] problem that I thought that I have of
[02:08] the podcast is getting so many guests on
[02:11] my show because I was like are there so
[02:13] many interesting people to talk to that
[02:16] I can fill every day guests and turns
[02:19] out yeah there there are a lot of people
[02:20] and I have a long long list that I have
[02:23] to work towards and then people want to
[02:25] be a second time on so like and there
[02:27] are new people joining every day to
[02:28] bitcoin so I guess the I I guess I can
[02:31] never interview everyone that that's my
[02:34] conclusion so like there's always
[02:35] someone to interview uh and uh the the
[02:39] the community is just really really big
[02:41] how long are you in the community uh so
[02:44] I got into Bitcoin through my family in
[02:47] around 2017 I actually heard about it I
[02:51] didn't get into it fully just because at
[02:53] the beginning it's always very rough
[02:56] isn't it so I fully started investing
[02:59] and educated myself in Bitcoin around
[03:02] 2020 I would say the year or 2019 one of
[03:06] the two it's when I left University
[03:09] that's when I really I dropped out of
[03:10] University sorry that's when I decided
[03:13] to really dive into Bitcoin you're now
[03:15] 21 so uh 2019 this is five years ago so
[03:20] this was like when you're
[03:22] 15 yeah 15 16 so oh wait no really 5
[03:26] years
[03:27] ago H Maybe yeah literally well 2017 we
[03:32] started like in my house we started to
[03:34] educate ourselves financially 20 and oh
[03:39] no then it was like later sorry then
[03:43] 2022 then maybe I think I left uni no
[03:47] 2021 I'm so confused with the days it
[03:49] doesn't matter at like 16 years old I
[03:51] started to like learn about Bitcoin
[03:54] learn about the financial system and
[03:56] then I was 18 years old when and I
[04:00] joined University yes I was 18 and then
[04:04] same year I dropped out of University
[04:06] that I joined so yeah I was 18 years old
[04:09] so I'm now 21 so yeah from that point I
[04:13] just fully dived in and educated myself
[04:16] about Bitcoin the most that I could so
[04:19] was Bitcoin a reason why you dropped out
[04:22] of school yes a massive reason yeah I
[04:25] think cuz once you adapt to a new
[04:29] Financial system and new way of thinking
[04:32] it's so hard to resist that and you just
[04:34] can't so going forward Bitcoin had a
[04:38] massive influence on the next steps even
[04:40] now in my life Bitcoin has a massive
[04:42] influence like everything that I kind of
[04:45] do is always surrounded by Bitcoin just
[04:47] because Bitcoin has such a massive is
[04:51] it's had a massive impact on my life so
[04:54] far and it will have in the future as
[04:56] well like the same as money does for a
[04:59] lot of people in the world Bitcoin is
[05:02] that is that to me now if that makes
[05:04] sense so yeah it had a massive impact on
[05:07] the reason why I left uni um and it all
[05:11] just came down to simple maths you know
[05:13] one day I sat down with my parents and I
[05:15] was
[05:16] like I'm going to UNI I'm not going to
[05:19] get anywhere in what four 3 years time
[05:23] it's not going to get me anywhere I'm
[05:24] going to be in so much debt I'm going to
[05:27] have no assets I'm going to have no
[05:29] savings I'm going to have no money and
[05:32] then I'm literally going to be nowhere
[05:34] and you know don't get me wrong there's
[05:36] a lot if I went into maybe because I
[05:38] studied graphic communication design and
[05:41] maybe if I decided to do maybe like a
[05:44] doctor or like a specialist within the
[05:47] doctor area or like a lawyer then okay
[05:50] stay in University that would be the
[05:51] perfect but I didn't have the passion
[05:53] for that I didn't even have the passion
[05:55] to do graphic design I just think what
[05:57] we get taught in schools
[06:00] it just it stays with you you know if
[06:03] you do like what so many years in school
[06:06] you adapt a way of thinking we're all
[06:08] kind of like sheep so at the time a lot
[06:10] of the friends I had and the people I
[06:14] surrounded myself with day today had a
[06:16] massive impact on my choices but thanks
[06:19] to my family that kind of and thanks to
[06:21] bitcoin to be honest and the fact that
[06:24] me and my family educated ourselves that
[06:26] changed my views on everything and just
[06:30] like I said I just sat down with my
[06:32] family and I did simple maths on where
[06:36] my life will be in the next 3 to four
[06:38] years time if I continue with the you
[06:41] know the system that I was going with
[06:43] and not the Bitcoin system and then I
[06:46] compared my life what it will be like in
[06:47] the next four years time if I continue
[06:50] investing into Bitcoin and to be honest
[06:52] I think I made the right decision
[06:54] because you know like I said I would
[06:56] have had no assets no money no
[06:59] experience no job really because it's
[07:02] hard I would probably not even like
[07:04] graphic design at the end of it it would
[07:05] just
[07:06] be yeah you know I didn't have a passion
[07:09] for at the beginning yet a lot yet alone
[07:11] towards the end and Bitcoin just changed
[07:14] my perspective completely and now my
[07:16] outcome in my life is completely
[07:19] different as well so yeah I I I totally
[07:22] get it especially for something like
[07:24] graphic designs or even coding or
[07:26] anything like you can learn this
[07:28] yourself like you can
[07:30] like you can learn it yourself make some
[07:32] projects and you can actually show
[07:34] people what you can do that might be
[07:38] harder when you want to be a
[07:41] doctor you you kind of have to to show
[07:44] them but degree probably helps there but
[07:46] for things like graphic designs or
[07:49] marketing or economics in general uh all
[07:52] all those areas it's like why go like
[07:55] massively in depth how much depth would
[07:57] you have accumulated uh if you would
[07:59] have done the whole university do you
[08:01] know that number yeah um I wouldn't know
[08:04] exactly cuz I dropped out so quickly
[08:06] it's crazy I think I only did like two
[08:09] months and I was done you know like I
[08:11] knew within the two months straight away
[08:13] just because I I live just outside of
[08:16] London so and my University was in
[08:19] actually like a little bit Central
[08:21] towards the top like north of London so
[08:23] the traveling and I'm at the South bit
[08:26] so traveling every day was crazy um um
[08:29] so yeah I only did two months of that
[08:31] and I did a foundation year which is so
[08:34] I'm so blessed that I did that I'm so
[08:37] happy I made that choice because I
[08:40] started with a foundation to even see if
[08:43] I liked uni and the course I decided to
[08:45] do and out of the two months I dropped
[08:47] out straight away but to answer your
[08:50] question like adding that on top plus
[08:53] three years and then plus who knows if I
[08:55] did an honors after as well um maybe
[08:58] like around 100,000 so a lot of money
[09:02] because the unit I got into was like
[09:04] known to be one of like the second in
[09:07] the world like out of creativity and
[09:09] like first in Europe or something like
[09:11] that so yeah yeah the charges was crazy
[09:14] but like that's the degree then you have
[09:16] to add the actually living expenses to
[09:19] travel there then actually maybe within
[09:22] the three or four years like I would
[09:23] have ended up living there so it's
[09:27] everything on top of that plus actually
[09:29] feeding myself going places buying like
[09:32] I don't know a piece of clothing or I
[09:35] don't know whatever will happen you know
[09:37] so you have to pay for everything really
[09:39] and you know I can't live off of my
[09:41] parents and it's not really like the
[09:43] values that I got taught in my household
[09:45] anyway like from the age of 16 when I
[09:47] started working i' from that point I've
[09:50] bought everything myself and I never fed
[09:53] off of my parents whereas a lot of
[09:55] people that go to UNI feed off of their
[09:57] parents and yeah I wouldn't want to be
[09:59] in that situation so yeah it was a lot
[10:01] of money and you know I don't come from
[10:03] a rid background so I yeah no definitely
[10:07] not so you were self- sustaining from
[10:10] age 16 years old yeah in the sense like
[10:14] in my household we the value that we
[10:16] always got taught is to work hard I
[10:18] think it's cuz my my dad my mom we
[10:21] didn't come from Rich backgrounds like
[10:23] we immigrated to England when I was
[10:25] around 2 years old so everything that
[10:28] they've kind of built they've made me
[10:30] and my brother appreciate it so
[10:32] therefore when I was around 16 years old
[10:34] that was the age in England when you
[10:36] were allowed to go and actually work so
[10:38] therefore I decided to go and get a job
[10:40] and then everything that I kind of
[10:42] earned I would you know buy everything
[10:44] that I needed myself I would never go
[10:46] out of my way to ask my parents
[10:48] obviously if it was like a necessity
[10:50] like something small like they were
[10:51] doing or you know something silly then
[10:53] it would be fine but like I would never
[10:55] go out of my way to be like oh can you
[10:56] buy me clothes or can you get me this
[10:58] car or like whatever it was you know I
[11:00] would never do that and yeah and I think
[11:03] that's a really good value as well
[11:04] because you can't get in like you can't
[11:07] get anywhere in life you know feeding
[11:10] off your parents or whatever you got to
[11:12] like actually be independent as well
[11:14] because I think then life teaches you a
[11:16] lot of values so yeah that was really
[11:19] important and I'm so glad because I have
[11:21] friends now where they've haven't worked
[11:24] a day in their life and you know they
[11:26] don't know the value of money and like I
[11:28] don't mean money in the sense of our
[11:30] feat but like even just Bitcoin you know
[11:32] the value of you know spend dedicating
[11:35] your time to get terrible money in
[11:38] return to then put it into Bitcoin but
[11:41] yeah people don't even know the value of
[11:42] that so what I was thinking with the
[11:44] student loaner is like if if you
[11:46] actually get something like that you
[11:47] should rather put it in in Bitcoin and
[11:49] work your ass off to pay back in the
[11:52] next like five years it's probably
[11:53] better investment yeah exactly 100% I
[11:56] actually had a friend who um he he took
[12:00] a loan all the loans he received from
[12:02] University he actually put them in like
[12:05] what terrible decision he could have put
[12:06] it into Bitcoin like he said but instead
[12:08] he put it into like coins it was
[12:11] terrible and I just think what are you
[12:13] doing so yeah God knows how that turned
[12:15] out but yeah yeah that's the best
[12:18] outcome I think it's interesting how
[12:21] many of our generation uh genen C I
[12:24] think is he called are into coins
[12:28] it's it's like when I see my audience I
[12:31] have literally and talked about that a
[12:34] lot in my podcast already I have three
[12:36] or four times more people above 65 than
[12:39] under 25 and I myself 25 so that's uh
[12:44] that's that's huge that there are not a
[12:46] lot of young people uh watching Bitcoin
[12:49] only content they watch crypto content
[12:51] they watch like this meme coin tokens
[12:53] yeah it's really interesting how how do
[12:55] you look at it and maybe do you have
[12:56] some stories of like friends or
[12:58] something like that that got into meme
[13:00] coins and alins well to be honest with
[13:03] you I think my perspective on that is
[13:05] why people do that because I think
[13:07] people are so stuck in the system we
[13:09] live in and because of inflation how
[13:12] everything goes up I think people's goal
[13:14] is always to quickly make money and I
[13:17] don't know live the life or spend it on
[13:19] whatever they want to spend and I think
[13:21] the fact that people want to chase after
[13:23] money so quickly I think that's why
[13:25] people get into coins not actually
[13:28] taken into consideration of what the out
[13:30] outcome could actually be you know when
[13:32] you spend anyone who spent hours
[13:36] actually revising Bitcoin they would
[13:38] never go into shitcoins but to your
[13:41] story part a lot of um my brother to be
[13:45] honest myself when I first started into
[13:47] Bitcoin I put like it was only £1 I
[13:51] remember I put into a governance token
[13:54] my uncle was like put it into this token
[13:56] it will grow like it'll be so good you
[13:57] know thinking I'm going to double or
[13:59] something and I did it and I lost
[14:01] everything and then at second point I
[14:03] put like £1,000 into into another token
[14:05] I've got like2 200 now it's crazy and
[14:08] you know every time I've done it like
[14:10] with Bitcoin it hasn't happened but with
[14:12] Bitcoin is a different story because
[14:14] like when you learn the properties of
[14:15] Bitcoin is completely different and the
[14:17] same with everyone but like people have
[14:19] to learn you know you have got to put
[14:20] into shitcoins to then know what the
[14:23] actual value is and then actually put
[14:25] into Bitcoin to actually know but I've
[14:27] never had I don't the problem is is I
[14:29] don't really have a lot of friends that
[14:31] are actually into Bitcoin like the only
[14:33] time I ever meet people is if I go to
[14:35] conferences and communicate but like on
[14:38] a day-to-day basis it's so hard like
[14:40] even if I mention Bitcoin people get
[14:43] like they take it as an attack so it's
[14:45] so hard for me to answer that question
[14:47] because yeah
[14:49] people I don't really have like a lot of
[14:51] people and I wish I did because it's
[14:53] like such a massive part of my life so I
[14:56] wish I had more people to talk to
[14:57] bitcoin about so yeah I haven't
[14:59] experienced that yet which is I guess
[15:01] good I've only experienced that like
[15:03] with my family and then me myself so
[15:06] yeah make Bitcoin friends it's a it's a
[15:09] cheat code to life uh it's like make as
[15:11] many Bitcoin connections as as you
[15:13] possibly can and I guess you already do
[15:16] that but also for the for the audience I
[15:18] was so long I was three years uh before
[15:21] uh I was three years in Bitcoin I was
[15:23] two years Bitcoin only 100% in Bitcoin
[15:26] and I never met another single person
[15:29] that that did the same thing in real
[15:32] life and it was not even uh going uh on
[15:34] on Twitter and asking and and going
[15:36] about like hey what are you doing with
[15:38] Bitcoin or something like that like I
[15:39] was completely alone with my Bitcoin
[15:41] stance yeah and this is not good like go
[15:44] go out there and and and on meet online
[15:47] people and Mee in real life people that
[15:49] actually believe in that crazy Bitcoin
[15:51] thing because otherwise you you will
[15:52] think at some point that you are
[15:54] actually crazy even though you're not
[15:56] yeah
[15:57] exactly no and I always think that when
[15:59] I like mention Bitcoin to anyone as well
[16:01] like I always think I'm the crazy one
[16:03] when realistically they're the crazy one
[16:05] cuz they're the one that are stuck in
[16:06] their own ways you know and it's just so
[16:09] hard I think the differen is is people
[16:11] aren't open-minded and it makes it so
[16:13] hard to just even talk or mention
[16:17] Bitcoin or you know or if you do they
[16:19] relate it back to shitcoins and it's
[16:21] like no no no no Bitcoin for me is a
[16:24] completely separate topic than shitcoins
[16:27] you know but even like you say that even
[16:29] when I went to conferences which Bitcoin
[16:31] conferences a lot of people are still
[16:33] into shitcoins like it's so hard to meet
[16:35] Maxis these days that I've realized like
[16:39] because I'm like Philly Bitcoin nothing
[16:41] else now you know and it's so hard to
[16:43] meet people that are like the same you
[16:45] know especially in real life like you
[16:47] said you know so yeah it's very
[16:49] difficult why do you think uh it's it's
[16:52] so hard um for for people to understand
[16:55] and crash Bitcoin like what's what's the
[16:58] hold I mean even like in the last few
[17:00] years we have so much great Bitcoin only
[17:03] content this was way different five six
[17:05] years ago but now it's like there's no
[17:07] excuse you can learn in about Bitcoin in
[17:10] like a week if you really dedicate
[17:11] yourself well I think people are lazy
[17:15] just to put it simply like people are
[17:16] definitely lazy to
[17:18] even okay number one people are so stuck
[17:21] in their own ways like even when you
[17:22] mention the topic like when I mention it
[17:25] I mention it out of excitement and I
[17:28] would love to speak to someone about it
[17:30] but when I do mention it people take it
[17:32] as an attack like I'm attacking their
[17:34] life or their choices or their knowledge
[17:36] or whatever and it's so hard to carry on
[17:39] a conversation like that whereas when
[17:41] you meet a different group of people
[17:43] where you do mention it and they're
[17:45] actually listen and they're open-minded
[17:47] then the conversation is completely
[17:49] different but I think you know people
[17:53] unfortunately our world is surrounded by
[17:55] the system we live in currently and the
[17:57] terrible money that we have currently so
[18:00] therefore people are so stuck in those
[18:02] ways and you know I don't care so much
[18:04] about the older generation but it's like
[18:06] the younger generation like people when
[18:09] you like I find it more interesting
[18:11] speaking to younger people just because
[18:13] it's like they're the future and I want
[18:14] to see their perspective on things but
[18:16] the problem is that is unfortunately
[18:20] young people listen to their parents and
[18:22] parents are stuck in their old ways and
[18:24] their old Financial system so therefore
[18:27] unfortunately people like my parents
[18:29] have a massive influence on my life and
[18:31] I'm sure it's the same for you it's like
[18:33] for anyone really so you know when you
[18:35] kind of like get excited about something
[18:37] like as a young person when you hear it
[18:39] from like your friends or something and
[18:41] you relate it back to your parents and
[18:43] the parents don't agree I think that has
[18:45] a massive impact on the child as well or
[18:47] like the young adult so therefore I
[18:50] think it's harder and then obviously the
[18:52] second part is people are so lazy like
[18:55] they don't care to or they care when
[18:58] it's too late do you know what I mean
[19:00] like yes I I think that's what it is
[19:03] it's laziness and people are not
[19:05] open-minded and they just don't want to
[19:07] learn and you know when you think about
[19:09] Bitcoin in the beginning even when I
[19:11] started learning about Bitcoin it was so
[19:13] hard and like complicated at the
[19:15] beginning like if it wasn't for my
[19:17] parents I probably wouldn't understand
[19:19] and I think people when they're young
[19:21] they're very immature and you know they
[19:24] don't care to learn about it and then
[19:26] when they do they're like oh I don't
[19:28] understand any of it you know so and
[19:30] then I don't really care about the old
[19:32] generation cuz they're going to die out
[19:33] soon anyway so it's like the young
[19:36] people are the future at the end of the
[19:37] day and the only positive thing is I
[19:40] think why there will be a massive
[19:42] adoption in the future is if you look at
[19:44] the Young Generation everyone is so much
[19:47] into technology as well so I think
[19:51] therefore Bitcoin is based on technology
[19:53] as well within itself so I think that's
[19:56] a good hope for the young people as well
[19:58] but one thing is well have you realized
[20:00] like a lot of people struggle to watch
[20:02] like an hour video young people everyone
[20:04] just watches Tik Tok for like one minute
[20:06] and they're like okay next you know so I
[20:08] think the spam is very different as well
[20:12] you know people don't want to watch like
[20:13] an hour's content or you know when was
[20:16] the last time you saw someone young
[20:17] reading a book like no one really does
[20:19] that these days and you know it's it's
[20:21] all to the social media at the end of
[20:23] the day and then also like the
[20:24] priorities change and you know
[20:27] everything changes as time goes on so
[20:30] yeah who knows what will happen but
[20:32] hopefully more younger people adopt it
[20:35] and they start listening to bitcoin as
[20:37] more instead of their
[20:39] parents it's so it's so interesting for
[20:42] me with the attention span because like
[20:44] two sides for me to do it like yes of
[20:46] course like they are on Tik Tok and they
[20:48] have no no attention span but at the
[20:51] same time they concentrate on that Tik
[20:53] Tok feed for like an hour or two hours
[20:56] so in the end they kind of have a long
[20:58] attention span but at at they have
[21:02] they have a really bad attention span in
[21:04] in the end of of one thing they always
[21:06] want a new distraction exactly and
[21:09] that's the way it was designed to do
[21:10] right like Tik Tok was designed for that
[21:13] you know so the same is with Instagram
[21:15] people like watching other people's
[21:17] lives instead of focusing on their own
[21:20] lives and with Tik Tok I just think oh
[21:22] this is new oh this is new new new new
[21:24] and then you spend like an hour on it
[21:26] and you're like oh my God where has the
[21:27] time gone but nobody ever actually
[21:29] reflects that among themselves nobody
[21:31] thinks oh am I wasting my time what am I
[21:34] doing with my time like you know instead
[21:37] of learning about Bitcoin Bitcoin
[21:38] Bitcoin Bitcoin or even like not even
[21:40] Bitcoin let's put Bitcoin for the side
[21:42] but Financial system Financial system
[21:43] how to make money or whatever you know
[21:46] people just prefer to watch other
[21:47] people's lives instead of focusing on
[21:49] their own so yeah that's bad it
[21:52] definitely is it's it's interesting for
[21:54] I asked in the beginning of my podcast
[21:56] like the first like 10 20 episodes a lot
[21:58] like why Bitcoin and after a while it
[22:00] got really
[22:02] boring because the same thing I bet yeah
[22:05] it's it repeats itself yeah but at some
[22:08] points I like to ask the question
[22:11] especially if there's someone with a
[22:12] unique perspective there uh for example
[22:14] yesterday was Tom Nelson in my podcast
[22:17] who is kind of getting orange pilled now
[22:20] but he's actually just about the climate
[22:22] topic and I really want to get to got
[22:24] that covered in the podcast he he I
[22:27] asked him and I also want to ask you
[22:29] because uh you are so much more younger
[22:32] than most of my guests you in my age
[22:34] range you're like four five years
[22:35] younger than me uh and it's it's it's
[22:38] like most of my guests are like 10 20 30
[22:40] years older than me sometimes even older
[22:42] than I had the my oldest guest was 76 he
[22:45] was literally 51 years older than me um
[22:48] so that's why I wanted to ask you why is
[22:51] it for you and for your generation uh
[22:54] Bitcoin so important like why should
[22:56] especially as you said you care about
[22:58] your generation and not so much about
[22:59] the older generation why is it for the
[23:01] younger generation so important that
[23:03] they care about Bitcoin I mean for me
[23:06] Bitcoin is so important because I have
[23:09] such a simple perspective when it comes
[23:11] to bitcoin I just like like it's been
[23:13] the best performing
[23:15] asset and at the end of the day Bitcoin
[23:17] debases our current Financial system
[23:20] simple and that's why it's so important
[23:22] to me and with my life as well I just
[23:25] you know I don't come from a rid
[23:26] background so it's so important like I
[23:29] work every single day and it's so
[23:32] important to preserve your energy and
[23:35] save it in something that's going to
[23:37] keep the same value or even more value
[23:39] over time and that's why I think it's so
[23:42] important for the younger generation
[23:44] because if you look at the older
[23:45] generation they all have houses you know
[23:47] they're in mortgages you know they have
[23:50] they've lived more of their life you
[23:52] know and don't get me wrong anyone can
[23:54] go into Bitcoin because that's why it's
[23:55] there it's for the people Bitcoin is for
[23:57] the people so that's super important but
[24:00] with the younger generation they're
[24:01] still learning and they're still finding
[24:03] out new things and unfortunately whether
[24:05] we all like it or not we all have to
[24:07] work in some way or shape or form you
[24:10] know we all have to feed ourselves and
[24:12] something so I think bitcoin's there to
[24:14] help our financial replace our financial
[24:17] system actually and you know by
[24:20] preserving your energy and putting it
[24:22] into Bitcoin that's so important so the
[24:25] quicker young people learn this the
[24:27] better their future will be and that's
[24:29] all it comes down to like my recipe for
[24:30] Bitcoin is so simple like I have to go
[24:33] to work I have to I'm not rich my family
[24:35] is not rich I have to work but why work
[24:38] and waste my time and waste my energy
[24:41] you know nobody really loves going to
[24:42] work you know because you're still
[24:44] you're fulfilling someone's dream at the
[24:46] end of the day but what you do with the
[24:50] carrot that you get at the end is what's
[24:52] important you know and if you're not
[24:55] going to focus on yourself and see that
[24:58] if you're going to put your money into
[24:59] savings bank account and that's going to
[25:02] lose its value after 10 years time then
[25:03] that's on you you know people don't care
[25:06] to learn and that's the issue so that's
[25:09] why I think young people just need to
[25:11] realize that it's just so difficult you
[25:13] know because as I said like the more you
[25:16] mention it the harder it gets if you're
[25:18] not open-minded I don't know that I
[25:20] didn't really answer your
[25:21] question so yeah no it's really good
[25:25] just just quick what are you actually
[25:27] working you mentioned it uh that you're
[25:29] working uh take a guess what do I look
[25:33] like I
[25:35] work well take a guess what you're
[25:38] working oh I never did I never guessed
[25:40] someone's occupation um I mean I'm only
[25:43] 21 so like I'm only starting out and
[25:45] don't get me wrong any job that I kind
[25:47] of do like it's an experiment for me and
[25:50] it's just and remember like my only
[25:53] purpose of going to work is so I can
[25:54] accumulate Bitcoin you
[25:56] know so what would you think inter
[26:00] interesting
[26:02] um a lot of uh I know a lot of young
[26:07] girls that actually do babysitting a lot
[26:10] uh in their free time uh when when they
[26:12] do something but there are those are
[26:13] usually people that actually study and
[26:15] have time then in the evenings and uh
[26:18] then it's good for studies um I don't
[26:20] study you you don't study that's that's
[26:23] like I have no clue I mean I study
[26:25] Bitcoin but that's different isn't it
[26:27] yeah it it's like uh everyone studies
[26:30] but not at University because without
[26:32] University you actually learn I just
[26:34] take a while to get no like that's what
[26:36] if you saw me on the street you were
[26:38] walking past me and someone said what do
[26:39] you think an occupation is what would
[26:41] you take a guess what guess would you
[26:43] take oh man I have no
[26:46] clue I'm quite small in real life as
[26:49] well I I think of something oh waitress
[26:52] waitress no okay I'll tell you uh I
[26:55] drive lores Arctic lores
[26:58] what what is that like hgv like you know
[27:02] the big lores like driving lores what is
[27:06] a Lori you don't know what a Lori is you
[27:08] know I don't know how to uh say it is it
[27:11] a car or no you know how you have a car
[27:14] then you have a bus you know uh oh you
[27:17] mean a camping van something like that
[27:19] you know bigger than a camping van you
[27:22] know lores that have deliveries on the
[27:24] back I have no clue really wait you've
[27:28] got internet right currently I got
[27:30] internet uh and and I will wait I will
[27:34] put that up now you can you can look it
[27:36] up with me uh I can maybe they say it
[27:41] differently in Austria I'm not sure Lor
[27:45] they definitely do because we speak
[27:47] German oh okay there we go yeah
[27:49] definitely then maybe there is a um l o
[27:53] r r y wait l o r r y
[28:00] why uh no no no like put Double R and
[28:04] then a y at the
[28:05] end and then without the w y for
[28:10] Yankee yeah that one the top one truck
[28:14] you know oh truck maybe that's what it
[28:15] is and then if you go in images maybe no
[28:18] way you drive a truck yeah you drive a
[28:22] semi-truck uh yeah like the big one the
[28:24] arctic ones I don't know how you say
[28:26] that in Germany though something like
[28:27] that
[28:28] yeah yeah like that exactly oh man
[28:31] that's called it Lori yeah it's called
[28:34] Lori in English I mean that's what I
[28:36] call it or like a truck you know you can
[28:38] say as well I I Know It with semi
[28:40] Tru is that the same thing oh show me uh
[28:45] semi-trailer truck that's what I know
[28:47] yeah I could probably ride one of those
[28:48] as
[28:49] well yeah they're quite I think their
[28:51] deliveries are longer I'm not sure
[28:53] actually but yeah big one the big ones
[28:56] how did you get to this wow that that's
[28:58] I would never have guessed that like not
[29:00] in nobody ever everyone has like weird
[29:02] reactions like no way and like when you
[29:04] see me in real life I'm like small as
[29:06] well and everyone always thinks like
[29:08] it's a man's job you know so it's funny
[29:12] um well I worked previously in a
[29:15] logistics company and the only reason
[29:17] why I went there was because I wanted to
[29:20] do my Lorry license I'm my very my
[29:22] perspective on life is try everything
[29:24] you know I'm not saying I'm going to
[29:26] drive Lor like I would love to have
[29:28] helicopter license a plane license a
[29:30] lorry license a drone license whatever
[29:33] you know I want to do it all you have to
[29:35] try everything in life you know and
[29:37] that's always been my perspective and I
[29:40] came into the logistics company hoping
[29:42] that I'll meet some sort of manager
[29:43] which I did and I asked him I knew
[29:46] another company which did like a boot
[29:49] camp for driving so I was like hm I need
[29:53] to get into this boot camp you know and
[29:55] actually get my license because they do
[29:57] it for free for you if you get into it
[29:59] and the only reason the only way I knew
[30:02] I could get into it is if um what's it
[30:04] called like the someone recommends me
[30:07] like a manager from a logistics company
[30:09] so that's exactly what happened and then
[30:11] they reach out to me and I was like
[30:12] brilliant let's begin this and yeah and
[30:15] then they did it all for free for me so
[30:16] I was like brilliant you know I earned
[30:19] more money more into Bitcoin I was like
[30:21] winwin really so yeah and you have to
[30:24] try everything so yeah that's how I got
[30:26] into it if you watch my podcast already
[30:28] for more than two times you know how
[30:31] extremely passionate I am about self-
[30:33] custody and the first very very very
[30:37] important step to self custody is always
[30:40] getting yourself a hardware wallet and I
[30:43] have one for you here this is the
[30:45] Bitcoin only Edition from the bitbox my
[30:48] favorite single signature Hardware
[30:50] wallet on the market another really
[30:53] important piece of self- custody if you
[30:56] have a hardware wallet is the backup of
[30:59] the seat phrase and bitbox made the
[31:01] perfect solution to back up your seat
[31:04] phrase they made a reusable steel wallet
[31:07] check out that beauty it's durable and
[31:10] extremely heavy if I put it on the desk
[31:13] I seriously feel for my own table it's
[31:16] so so heavy and durable I love it this
[31:19] is where my seed phrase is secure go to
[31:23] bitbox
[31:24] do/ robobin to get your bitbox and if
[31:28] you use code Robin you even get 5% off
[31:32] of your complete order and the next step
[31:35] is to really level up your sovereignty
[31:38] as an individual you have to have the
[31:40] most secure self- custody setup you have
[31:43] to secure your own devices you have to
[31:46] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:49] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:51] where you live you even want to have a
[31:53] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[31:56] in case something go was really really
[31:58] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:00] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step

[32:16] not least I have something completely
[32:18] new for you guys I partnered up with
[32:21] coin vigilante this is the most
[32:24] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:27] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:30] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:32] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[32:36] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:39] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[32:41] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[32:45] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[32:48] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:51] watch collections you have the date of
[32:54] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:57] there and of course also the block
[32:59] height and which Epoch we are currently
[33:02] in I love the level of detail they put
[33:05] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[33:08] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:11] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[33:13] love those watches so so much that is
[33:17] fascinating that you are doing that um
[33:20] how long are you doing that now and when
[33:22] did you do your license I started my
[33:25] license beginning of the year I had it
[33:27] say
[33:28] I think January feary March April May
[33:32] April around April so yeah around April
[33:34] I got my license and then like to
[33:37] transition obviously it took some time
[33:39] because no experience at the beginning
[33:41] which is also another hard thing like I
[33:43] it's so funny to me how like people want
[33:45] people to work but there's always that
[33:47] experience part that limits people do
[33:50] you know what I mean and you got to
[33:51] start somewhere um so yeah I've been
[33:54] driving for like yeah a month two months
[33:57] now so I'm very new to it it's all
[33:59] beginning stages at the moment but I had
[34:02] my license from like April June is
[34:05] somewhere around there so yeah I just
[34:08] imagine like being on a gas station uh
[34:11] like there's like a big lorry big truck
[34:13] coming along and then there's like this
[34:15] small uh young
[34:17] blond girl standing outside like exactly
[34:21] you steal that from somewhere I do I get
[34:24] so many weird reactions like even when
[34:26] I'm driving like I just see people
[34:28] looking and then they just can't stop
[34:29] looking because I don't know why because
[34:32] like from my face I look really young as
[34:34] well like my genetics are very you know
[34:36] I look young and then obviously I'm
[34:37] quite small as well so like and then
[34:39] this massive Lori and yeah it's crazy
[34:42] even when I'm reversing oh my God
[34:44] another a story it's crazy so yeah did
[34:48] the police
[34:50] ever turn you over to like do you have
[34:53] your license Madam no but I actually I
[34:56] went to a company and I was just
[34:58] delivering something it was like more up
[34:59] north in England and they I come back
[35:02] the same day to like where I work like
[35:05] down the bottom and the lady in the
[35:07] office says to me um someone rang me
[35:10] from the company that I went to earlier
[35:12] and said is she allowed to drive she
[35:14] looks really
[35:15] young so I was like oh my God so yeah I
[35:19] always get it it's crazy and I'm sure
[35:20] I'm going to get it more and more you
[35:22] know because when I'm going to be 40 I'm
[35:23] going to look like I'm 20 so it's crazy
[35:27] yeah but it speaks uh volumes to uh your
[35:31] money mindset it I I love that you are
[35:34] trying a lot of art because that's what
[35:37] I also did and still do honestly um with
[35:41] with the time between 20 and 30 for me
[35:44] is a time to try everything and go high
[35:47] risk definitely it's like make a lot of
[35:51] uh connections make a lot of skills uh
[35:53] and and try a lot of experiences like
[35:56] have have a life that that you really
[35:58] want to uh that that you live
[36:02] experiences a lot of different ones so
[36:05] you can actually um tell someone from
[36:08] something you have to have some sort of
[36:10] interesting life uh so so that's like
[36:13] the 20 to uh 30 area after 30 maybe you
[36:18] can get a little bit more targeted like
[36:20] a little bit more like in One Direction
[36:21] you should figure out a little bit more
[36:23] but still after 30 you can make a lot of
[36:25] changes uh but if you Tri a lot between
[36:28] 20 and 30 you probably don't have to do
[36:30] a lot of changes with 30 because you
[36:33] Tred 10 years different things and you
[36:34] know what you want and you you don't
[36:36] want so that's that's a that's a huge
[36:38] thing and I love that you're already
[36:40] with like 20 on so far that other people
[36:43] are not with never yeah someone said to
[36:46] me actually the other day they were like
[36:48] how old are you and I go 21 and he goes
[36:50] damn you've really experienced a lot
[36:52] already and like to be honest like that
[36:54] was just the driving side and he doesn't
[36:55] even know half of the things you know
[36:57] just I'm not saying it's massive but I
[36:59] don't know my perspective like you have
[37:01] to try everything you know because if
[37:03] you're gonna go through life asking what
[37:06] if what if and you never do it like
[37:08] imagine when you reach your deathbed and
[37:10] you'll be like oh my God like I I I wish
[37:12] I should have tried you know and I think
[37:15] one thing that always limits us as
[37:17] people is fear I don't know if you've
[37:19] realized like even doing this podcast
[37:20] today I was so scared I was like oh my
[37:22] God am I GNA be good enough like I'm
[37:24] probably my words are GNA be terrible
[37:26] you I'm gonna like um what's the word um
[37:31] mat and yeah yeah I was just thinking
[37:33] crazy things and things like fear stop
[37:37] us from doing crazy things in life and
[37:39] don't get me wrong like you always have
[37:40] to be safe you have to use your brain
[37:43] and think but never stop trying you know
[37:45] you have to keep going and that's why
[37:48] relating back to bitcoin you have to try
[37:51] you know you have to be open-minded you
[37:52] know so yeah it's really good to try and
[37:55] because then you're going to not going
[37:56] to ask yourself what if what if you know
[37:59] so it's really um there's there's those
[38:02] seasons of yes and seasons of NOS I like
[38:05] those fears like there are seasons in
[38:07] your life where you have to say almost
[38:09] yes yes to almost everything and then
[38:12] then the seasons of like when you figure
[38:14] out what you want to do then all of the
[38:15] sudden you have to say no so many times
[38:17] because you want to focus and don't want
[38:19] to have those distractions it's really
[38:20] interesting I went to a fre season of
[38:23] yes like I think like two three years
[38:25] between like 20 and and 24 and now I'm
[38:28] kind of getting into a season of no
[38:30] where I really just want to do the
[38:31] podcast and do that every day and
[38:33] everything else is like no I don't have
[38:35] time to go out
[38:37] today yeah no that's good yeah you have
[38:40] to set your time straight don't you and
[38:42] your priorities for us I think at the
[38:44] moment I'm in the season of
[38:46] yeses
[38:48] definitely yeah just getting out of your
[38:50] comfort zone that's so important you
[38:52] know really really cool um one thing
[38:55] that I was wondering um you you probably
[38:57] have a lot of peers uh that that are
[39:00] around you how do they look at money and
[39:03] how do you look at money and what's the
[39:05] difference there in in your like the
[39:07] general uh generation SE money mindset
[39:10] versus what you have learned especially
[39:13] also with
[39:14] Bitcoin oh my God completely
[39:17] different yeah no it's very different uh
[39:19] I'll give you like I don't know in every
[39:21] other country but like in the UK it's
[39:23] very go to school you go to school you
[39:26] pass your gcc's you do your A Levels you
[39:28] go to university get a job get a
[39:30] mortgage have a family live your life
[39:33] and die and then like with Bitcoin is
[39:35] completely different like it's changed
[39:37] my perspective completely like from
[39:39] dropping out of uni the people that I
[39:41] talk to communicate with the things I do
[39:43] to get out of my comfort zone is
[39:45] completely different whereas people are
[39:47] just so stuck and they just Chase and
[39:49] Chase constantly after money does
[39:52] unfortunately not going to get them
[39:53] anywhere because of our broke Financial
[39:55] system and I think that's the difference
[39:58] you know I even from a young age when I
[40:01] like in 2017 when I started learning
[40:04] about the financial system because
[40:05] that's what it begins with you know it
[40:07] doesn't just go straight into Bitcoin
[40:09] like the excitement I had and I knew
[40:11] after reading I probably you probably
[40:13] get this a lot Rich Dad Poor Dad I'm
[40:15] sure you have that a lot yes yeah it's
[40:17] like a beginnner book for everyone but
[40:19] after reading that I was like oh my God
[40:22] there's like this completely different
[40:24] world and I'm here thinking in the old
[40:26] system
[40:28] and just the difference between assets
[40:30] liability good debt bad debt you know
[40:33] you start thinking you start using your
[40:35] brain and then once you go down that
[40:37] rabbit hole obviously that leads you to
[40:39] bitcoin and other assets you know but
[40:41] once you go down that rabbit hole it's
[40:44] crazy it changes your perspective
[40:46] completely and at the beginning when I
[40:48] was still going to school and I was
[40:49] learning about the financial system I
[40:51] had this excitement and I would share
[40:52] that with other people and to be honest
[40:54] I got laughed at for like 2 months from
[40:56] my friend
[40:57] yeah like just learning about the
[40:59] financial system and trying to share
[41:01] that with other people is really hard so
[41:03] even just a small situation like that
[41:04] really showed me that actually people
[41:07] want to be stuck you know I used to feel
[41:09] sorry for people but now I just don't
[41:10] completely and I don't know whether
[41:12] that's a good or a bad thing but you
[41:14] know I try to share what I know and
[41:16] obviously there's still a lot that I
[41:17] don't know but um yeah with people it's
[41:20] very hard you try to say one thing they
[41:22] don't agree they think Bitcoin is either
[41:24] a scam the system they're living in is
[41:26] perfect although they're in debt you
[41:28] know they're not living their good life
[41:30] but they're never really open to a
[41:32] different perspective so it's really
[41:34] hard to communicate with people and you
[41:36] know just a small situation like getting
[41:38] laughed that really showed me that
[41:40] actually I should close my mouth and you
[41:42] know get on with what's right for me and
[41:44] it's really upsetting actually because
[41:46] when I like I said earlier when I do
[41:48] mention Bitcoin I mention it out of good
[41:50] and like I get excited it's not a way to
[41:53] attack anyone and I also think Bitcoin
[41:55] was designed as a Financial system to
[41:58] help people you know it's not there to
[42:00] come for you or attack you it's only
[42:03] there to help you and it's your choice
[42:05] as a person whether you use that or not
[42:07] but I think it's the way you're raised
[42:09] and your views on life that separate
[42:11] people from actually going down the
[42:13] rabbit hole or even listening or
[42:15] educating themselves or even investing
[42:17] you know that you know separates us
[42:20] people so it's just the views that
[42:22] separate us so yeah it's very
[42:25] difficult what did this whole thing
[42:28] started was it your parents that just
[42:30] like started that that thinking process
[42:32] or like was there some event yeah so my
[42:34] dad I'm sure you might yeah you probably
[42:36] speak to my dad better but like um my
[42:39] dad went to a some sort of conference
[42:42] you know basically we we worked so hard
[42:45] in our lives and my I think my parents
[42:47] reached a point where they were like
[42:49] we're chasing like there was free ad
[42:50] there's free adults in my house that
[42:52] work they've worked from a very young
[42:54] age they had me and my brother at a very
[42:55] young age and they constantly worked and
[42:59] they hit a point in their life they were
[43:01] like we're working but what like why are
[43:03] we not getting anything else you know so
[43:06] I think that's when my dad my uncle and
[43:08] then my mom they both Dig Down The
[43:10] Rabbit Hole
[43:11] of we need to we need to see what's
[43:14] wrong you know and I think that's when
[43:16] my I believe my dad went to a conference
[43:19] and there was these two guys and this
[43:20] was like the end of 2017 after all the
[43:23] hype and everything that just happened
[43:25] and yeah so in 2017 17 they went to a
[43:28] conference somewhere in England I'm not
[43:30] sure where and my dad met this with his
[43:33] friend at the time so my friend and my
[43:35] uncle sorry but um he met these two
[43:38] bitcoiners and then something they said
[43:41] I don't know what exactly they told my
[43:43] dad but something stuck in his head and
[43:46] from that point onwards he knew he had
[43:48] to check out what Bitcoin was and
[43:51] obviously once you if you haven't
[43:53] open-minded and you knew that you know
[43:56] everything you're doing
[43:57] is not going to get you anywhere
[43:59] differently in life there has to be a
[44:00] different solution and that's why he
[44:03] started to explore Bitcoin and thank
[44:06] goodness for that you know because I
[44:09] wouldn't be in the situation I am now if
[44:11] it wasn't for him actually you know
[44:13] learning about Bitcoin even for my uncle
[44:16] and for my mom if they didn't learn
[44:17] about Bitcoin they wouldn't have a
[44:19] massive influence on me and then at the
[44:22] age yeah so they started learning and
[44:24] then my brother got into Bitcoin and I
[44:27] was very immature still like I was still
[44:30] in my school didn't really care very
[44:32] immature I didn't even think about
[44:34] Bitcoin we just spoke about it a lot in
[44:36] my house and then cuz my brother started
[44:38] investing into Bitcoin and I could see
[44:40] from a side point of views that my my
[44:42] dad and my brother had a topic about
[44:44] Bitcoin and I was like oh my God why is
[44:46] no one speaking to me about this you
[44:48] know I want to talk about Bitcoin you
[44:49] know I have no topic with anyone now
[44:51] because that's all we ever spoke about
[44:53] and I was like oh my God I need to do
[44:56] something and then that's when I started
[44:57] to learn about Bitcoin and that
[45:00] obviously really brought me close with
[45:01] my family and they had a massive impact
[45:04] and then that's like we started
[45:05] listening to a lot of podcasts we
[45:07] started reading a lot of books we spoke
[45:09] about it nearly every single day I used
[45:12] to have a dog at the time and we used to
[45:14] go on walks and we used to just speak
[45:15] about Bitcoin Financial system and and
[45:18] that's when it started getting really
[45:19] difficult for me as well at that time
[45:20] because I reached a a point where I was
[45:23] like okay like this is cool like I'm
[45:25] speaking to my family I'm now investing
[45:27] into Bitcoin like I see the bigger
[45:28] picture and I see like I'm not the crazy
[45:31] one you know I'm doing the right thing
[45:33] and this feels like the right thing and
[45:35] honestly from 2009 to now it showed us
[45:38] that this is the right thing and you
[45:40] know it's the best performing asset for
[45:42] no reason you know there's a reason to
[45:44] it you know so I knew I was doing the
[45:47] right thing but that's when the point
[45:48] that I reached and I was like oh my God
[45:50] but I have no one else to talk to about
[45:52] you know Bitcoin like you kind of reach
[45:54] a standpoint and there's only so much
[45:55] you can learn within your house
[45:56] household you know that's why it's good
[45:58] getting other people's perspective so
[46:00] that's when me and my dad started going
[46:01] to different conferences like the madira
[46:03] the Prague one and we met a lot of cool
[46:05] people and we started like and then you
[46:07] realize when you go to the conferences
[46:09] you're like oh my God I'm not the crazy
[46:11] one you know everyone kind of thinks on
[46:13] the same level as you whereas you know
[46:15] on their day-to-day life nobody really
[46:17] cares and they're own so they're so
[46:19] stuck in the rap race they're constantly
[46:21] chasing something that is nothing really
[46:24] so yeah that that's so that's so true I
[46:28] love that a lot and you also told me you
[46:30] you made uh oh no you didn't told me but
[46:32] I saw your video where you put published
[46:35] on on on on uh YouTube where you made a
[46:37] list what you like about Bitcoin it was
[46:40] a really long do you have the list
[46:42] actually with you uh it's upstairs
[46:44] somewhere do you want me to grab it oh I
[46:47] think it would be great yeah yeah okay
[46:49] give me like one minute I made a list
[46:51] when I started learning about Bitcoin
[46:54] and I was like why is Bitcoin good and I
[46:58] had to because I forget a lot you know
[47:00] and like deep down I know why bitcoin's
[47:03] good but you know my memory is terrible
[47:05] and I always forget so I was like my
[47:07] goal is to make a list of all the
[47:09] reasons why I think and other people
[47:11] think Bitcoin is so great and this came
[47:13] from like learning from podcasts and
[47:16] then reading books and then I just came
[47:18] to my conclusion why bitcoin's the best
[47:22] should I name them um maybe gives us
[47:26] some of your
[47:27] uh favorite ones I don't I don't know
[47:29] how long is that that list it's like
[47:33] there's a lot can you see oh yeah there
[47:35] a another page yeah they're like bullet
[47:38] points so I'm not going to read all of
[47:40] it I'll read some of it yeah name us
[47:42] some about some of your favorites okay
[47:44] so obviously
[47:46] decentralized that's the best thing and
[47:48] also like the scarcity of Bitcoin is 21
[47:51] million I think that's why Bitcoin is so
[47:54] great because if you look at a current
[47:56] Fiat system
[47:57] oh my God it's literally controlled by
[47:59] the government and that's why it's so
[48:00] corrupt because they can do whatever
[48:03] they like with it and we're the they're
[48:05] like dangling a bit of string and we're
[48:07] chasing after their dream and that like
[48:10] their power if that makes sense so the
[48:12] fact that Bitcoin is decentralized and
[48:14] no one has the authority or power over
[48:16] it apart from you know me myself and
[48:19] everyone else who's in Bitcoin is
[48:21] beautiful you know I think that's the
[48:22] most important part of Bitcoin um so
[48:25] that's definitely one that like stands
[48:28] out the most that's why it's number one
[48:31] decentralized um
[48:34] got I think transportable as well I know
[48:38] that sounds funny but like I always
[48:39] compared this to Gold cuz I was like if
[48:42] I invest in gold that's not
[48:44] transportable what if there's a war in
[48:47] my country the same day and I need to
[48:49] move somewhere and I need to take all my
[48:51] life savings and start a new life
[48:53] somewhere gold isn't going to give me
[48:55] that you know and the so much chaos
[48:58] around gold as well of I don't know even
[49:01] if you did put it into like an account
[49:03] where someone keeps the gold for you the
[49:05] whole process of that is so complicated
[49:07] and I don't want someone else to be in
[49:09] charge of my assets I want to be the one
[49:11] who's in charge so that's why I P put
[49:14] portable because I think it's so
[49:15] important where I could grab my keys
[49:18] grab my wallet and I can leave the next
[49:20] day I can leave this building this house
[49:22] that I'm in right now and I can just go
[49:25] and live somewhere else with you know no
[49:27] one controlling me and I think that's
[49:28] reallyy important and there's a girl
[49:30] actually I can't remember her name she
[49:33] is it North Korea that's bad or South
[49:35] Korea uh North North yeah North Korea
[49:38] she's in Bitcoin is I don't know I I saw
[49:41] some of her videos where people have
[49:43] invited her I think Joe Rogan actually
[49:45] had her on his podcast but the situation
[49:48] was really bad in obviously North Korea
[49:51] and the one thing that saved her was
[49:53] Bitcoin so and I just think wow and that
[49:56] Rel to portability as well because she
[49:58] literally memorized her keys and all her
[50:01] life savings and her family you know
[50:03] they worked so hard towards and she left
[50:06] the next day well not the next day it's
[50:08] not that easy but you know what I mean
[50:09] like she left and she started her life
[50:12] elsewhere but her savings were in these
[50:15] keys that she memorized so I think
[50:17] that's why portability is so
[50:19] important a point that a lot of people
[50:21] Overlook I think I got I get asked
[50:24] sometimes on other podcast when I'm the
[50:26] guest like what's the most underrated
[50:28] feature of Bitcoin it's the portability
[50:30] that's the uh everyone talks about the
[50:32] monetary policy how it goes up how it it
[50:35] it saves your financial energy and
[50:37] that's great like that's a huge uh huge
[50:40] feature but the one that's overlooked is
[50:42] a lot like you can remember literally 12
[50:44] words make a rhyme with it like make
[50:46] some some some text or something with it
[50:49] so you can remember it nicely and just
[50:51] go over the Border like nobody knows
[50:53] what you're doing with that like nobody
[50:55] can scan your uh brain at least not now
[50:59] if you have the if you have keys in them
[51:01] or not like you can literally take uh a
[51:04] few hundred euros in there you can take
[51:06] billion euros in there like it doesn't
[51:08] matter like that's a completely
[51:10] underrated feature of of Bitcoin I feel
[51:12] like and I just think also the process
[51:14] of sending huge sums of money like
[51:16] through a bank it takes ages through
[51:19] gold it takes even longer you know and
[51:21] with Bitcoin you don't have that problem
[51:23] so imagine if now you going to flee the
[51:25] country because something bad is
[51:27] happening to you you know your outcome
[51:30] you would be devastated as a person
[51:33] that's when I say like my views on
[51:34] bitcoin are so basic like as long as
[51:37] they meet my standards and they Bitcoin
[51:39] makes me feel safe and it gives me a
[51:41] hope for a better future that's the most
[51:43] important thing and that's what
[51:44] portability does with Bitcoin you know
[51:46] you have these worries but with Bitcoin
[51:48] you don't have those worries because you
[51:50] know if something bad happened you just
[51:52] leave the next day you know so I think
[51:55] it's really important like you said it's
[51:56] very
[51:57] underrated yeah I read some other ones
[51:59] this is beautiful as well I put I read
[52:02] it out actually I put a jurisdiction can
[52:05] be made to shut down facilities this
[52:07] will have zero effect on bitcoin not
[52:09] like the Four Seasons Hotels for example
[52:12] get shut down they go out of business
[52:14] completely with Bitcoin you don't have
[52:16] that impact you know if Bitcoins get
[52:19] shut down I think that's one of the
[52:21] every time I speak to like a normal
[52:22] person they're like oh it's a scam what
[52:24] if it gets shut down what if Government
[52:26] takes it you know it doesn't work like
[52:29] that in Bitcoin even if the whole
[52:31] internet in the world shut down and
[52:33] someone's going to power up the next day
[52:35] Bitcoin is still there you know your
[52:37] energy is still preserved and it's still
[52:40] there and that's one miss communication
[52:43] that people have about Bitcoin because
[52:46] it's not going anywhere it's only
[52:48] growing stronger you know Bitcoin is not
[52:51] going anywhere so it's really important
[52:53] and yeah that's really cool feature I
[52:55] think the fact that you can't shut it
[52:57] down and it's not like a hotel or like a
[52:59] house that can get bombed or whatever
[53:02] you know it's not like a property gold
[53:04] can be mined more of silver doesn't have
[53:07] the best values as gold you know there's
[53:09] so many different assets I can compare
[53:11] this to but yeah Bitcoin really is
[53:14] superior did you ever consider other
[53:16] assets for yourself uh yeah I did think
[53:19] about other assets like gold I thought
[53:21] about but I you know doing this list I
[53:24] came to the conclusion like actually
[53:27] like even just portability like we
[53:29] mentioned earlier I couldn't have that
[53:31] with gold silver was out of the picture
[53:33] because gold was better than silver just
[53:36] because of its actual like core
[53:38] properties a house there's no way in
[53:41] chance I'm ever going to buy a house in
[53:43] this situation I'm not rich that I'm not
[53:46] going to get a mortgage I'm I don't want
[53:48] to like risk my freedom for a mortgage
[53:50] that I have to pay off for the rest of
[53:52] my life till like I'm 80 you know
[53:55] there's no chance so I just put all my
[53:58] cards on the table I just looked at the
[53:59] bigger picture and I was like what is
[54:02] actually which one's going to give me
[54:04] the best outcome for my future the one
[54:06] that I want and I think Bitcoin gave me
[54:08] that so yeah I just compared every
[54:10] single asset and just came to the
[54:12] conclusion but also I compared like my
[54:14] financial situation as well then also
[54:17] like I compared the fact that Bitcoin is
[54:19] technically new like it was only created
[54:21] in 2009 and chances like Bitcoin
[54:24] honestly come once in a lifetime like
[54:26] there's going to be a moment of time
[54:28] where who's going to have Bitcoin you
[54:30] know if you're not accumulating now
[54:32] who's going to have it in the future I
[54:34] know it's a financial system but
[54:36] like like the same as Warren Buffett
[54:39] like he bought stocks of like earlier in
[54:42] his years and now they've accumulated so
[54:45] much that he's living his dream life and
[54:47] I think it's the same with Bitcoin is
[54:49] like if you don't jump on this wagon is
[54:52] going to go you know sooner or later so
[54:54] yeah that's yeah really important you
[54:56] have to take risks you know life is
[54:58] about risks but you got to take the
[55:00] right risk and that's why you got to lay
[55:01] your cards out on the table look at it
[55:03] plain and simple and decide what the
[55:05] best thing for you is because you know
[55:07] for me it was Bitcoin I just compared
[55:09] like each point and I decided it was
[55:11] Bitcoin but for someone else maybe is
[55:13] gold or maybe it is to buy a house you
[55:15] know but I I look in terms of Investing
[55:18] For My Future and preserving my energy I
[55:21] don't look like I don't look at it as
[55:23] like a form of liability cuz a lot of
[55:25] people buy buy houses just so they can
[55:28] like you know live in their house you
[55:29] know have their family and stuff but
[55:31] like it's not a form of investment to
[55:34] like grow your wealth if that makes
[55:35] sense so yeah it's not a good investment
[55:39] absolutely it's um I think every anyone
[55:42] that looks at if if you want to preserve
[55:46] your value for the future um you have to
[55:50] look at Bitcoin like I I I don't know
[55:51] how anyone can invest in anything else
[55:55] it's it's a really AR for me like if you
[55:58] have okay let's say you have like uh
[56:00] 2,000 Bitcoin in your wallet okay maybe
[56:04] you can invest in the house maybe you
[56:06] can buy something else like it doesn't
[56:08] matter for you because you're so damn
[56:10] Bridge already so that that that's
[56:12] another situation but if you're an
[56:14] average show like there's no other asset
[56:16] for you than Bitcoin exactly that's the
[56:19] that that's the whole Magic to it do you
[56:21] see Bitcoin I mean as a 21 year old uh
[56:25] maybe you didn't think about that uh
[56:27] till now but do you think as Bitcoin
[56:31] already as your retirement plan or or
[56:34] what you like okay that I I want to save
[56:36] at least like 10% of each month like
[56:38] already towards my retirement yeah I
[56:41] read um richest men in Babylon I don't
[56:43] know if you ever heard of the book yeah
[56:46] oh no I heard about it never never read
[56:48] it I think I should read it no but one
[56:51] of the points in that book was save 10%
[56:54] of your earnings and and from that point
[56:57] every paycheck everything that I get I
[56:59] put 10% look it's like you said you know
[57:03] you look at the bigger picture Okay
[57:05] Bitcoin works best for me simple like
[57:07] whether it makes sense to anyone else I
[57:09] don't care it works for me it's my
[57:11] future it's my life I don't see any
[57:13] other way apart from Bitcoin but it's
[57:16] saving the 10% is so important you know
[57:19] no matter what paycheck what money you
[57:21] get that 10% is going to be your
[57:23] retirement so from the beginning I've
[57:25] always looked at Bitcoin as a source of
[57:28] retirement number one for yeah for ages
[57:31] like for the when I imagine know 30 4050
[57:34] whatever age I want to retire at Bitcoin
[57:37] is going to be my retirement but also
[57:39] like saving my energy you know so saving
[57:41] my energy putting like Bitcoin as a form
[57:44] of retirement was really important to me
[57:47] so important like there's no other way
[57:49] to it like why I'll save your energy
[57:51] it's like people you know people save in
[57:53] the bank like why are you saving that
[57:54] money in the bank for what because you
[57:56] want to have that as a retirement or you
[57:58] want to buy that house or you want to
[58:00] have the future that you want to have
[58:02] you know and bitcoin's that for me you
[58:04] know so yeah should I read it is it is
[58:08] it a good read Babylon uh what is it
[58:10] about um so it's more like a story I
[58:13] haven't read in ages actually I need to
[58:15] reread it CU you know they say always to
[58:17] reread a book twice it's so important um
[58:21] I read it when I was quite young so the
[58:22] points I got from it's more like a story
[58:24] of a guy and um obviously the times in
[58:28] Babylon it's explaining that but it's
[58:30] the values that he put into the book
[58:31] like they're saving the 10% that's the
[58:34] only thing that I like got out of it the
[58:35] most because once you pick up a point
[58:37] from a book you're like oh nothing else
[58:39] really makes sense that's why it's so
[58:40] important to read a book twice you know
[58:43] so that's the most important that I bit
[58:45] that I got out the book and I don't
[58:47] remember if it was the richest man in
[58:48] Babylon or another book but I might be
[58:51] wrong on this so don't take my word for
[58:53] it but I think in the book it explained
[58:55] how you have coins back in the days I
[58:58] think it was in the Roman times actually
[58:59] no this is was in the book from Babylon
[59:02] I don't think so anyway I'll explain
[59:04] anyway but back in the Roman times they
[59:06] had coins right which they had gold in
[59:08] them well over time when you know the
[59:12] power and the greed was there the actual
[59:14] gold coin was chipped away so the gold
[59:17] within itself got chipped away so
[59:19] therefore the gold like the coins value
[59:21] got lost over time I don't know remember
[59:24] I I just can't remember if that was the
[59:25] B or a different book that I read
[59:27] because I've read so many different
[59:28] books like it just gets put into one
[59:30] part all together but yeah the main
[59:32] thing I got out of the book was the 10%
[59:34] and I think that's for anyone you know
[59:36] whether you're investing in Bitcoin or
[59:37] not always save your 10% because that's
[59:39] for your retirement so yeah I think read
[59:42] it I'm gonna read it again
[59:44] too really really cool yeah I I also
[59:47] actually have the strategy with books
[59:49] because if I read a book it's really
[59:52] hard to remember everything so I always
[59:54] try to like get one key takeaway like if
[59:57] I read a book right now I want to take I
[60:00] want to get one key takeaway from that
[60:03] and then many stories and arguments and
[60:06] signals around that one key takeaway to
[60:09] really hammer it down so like whatever
[60:12] um whatever it is for example I because
[60:14] a guest recommended to me um buy back
[60:17] your time was the last one I finished uh
[60:20] and it's really amazing how you can
[60:22] actually I haven't read that one I need
[60:23] to it's uh it's it's a really good read
[60:27] if you want to get started with
[60:29] entrepreneurship or if you even have
[60:31] already some entrepreneurship it's also
[60:33] good if you are not an entrepreneur but
[60:35] it's h it's kind of screwed towards
[60:39] entrepreneurship so like if you have a
[60:41] small business or like you're starting
[60:43] to make you have like one two employees
[60:46] already then it's really good um because
[60:49] a lot of small business entrepreneurs
[60:51] they they tend to burn out and there are
[60:54] reasons for that and it's a really
[60:56] amazing book to to like yeah as as the
[60:59] title already says buy back your time
[61:02] like not not hiring to to grow the
[61:04] business but hiring to actually buyb
[61:06] your time so you can actually uh grow
[61:09] the business there was some really
[61:10] interesting takeaways in there for me uh
[61:13] that I have now in in my plan of of
[61:16] maybe making this podcast a little bit
[61:18] more of a business and not just the one
[61:19] man show yeah that's good that's really
[61:22] good and like stuff like that are so
[61:23] important that's why it's really cool
[61:25] like having a podcast in the first place
[61:27] because people's knowledge and Views get
[61:29] put on you as well which is really good
[61:31] and especially the people that are in
[61:32] the Bitcoin industry because you know
[61:36] like I've never really seen anything
[61:37] like it you know one that everyone
[61:39] thinks are like but two like everybody
[61:41] has their own unique experiences and
[61:44] stuff that they've gained knowledge on
[61:46] which they can give you you know which
[61:47] is really cool oh sorry because you can
[61:49] learn from you know other people
[61:51] actually I was going to ask you have you
[61:53] read the Bitcoin standard I'm sure you
[61:55] have yes it was my first how did you
[61:57] find that book oh okay first book how
[61:59] did you find it was it difficult for you
[62:01] at the beginning uh I read it really
[62:03] late like I read it when I already had
[62:06] most of my money in Bitcoin because I'm
[62:08] not a big guy unfortunately I'm I'm
[62:12] really really big on on podcasting uh
[62:16] like always like I learned a lot with
[62:18] podcasts and and then I recently got
[62:21] into audiobooks so now I'm more and more
[62:24] of an a book guy uh but uh I already
[62:28] read it when I had like I don't know 30
[62:32] interviews uh of cerine already in me so
[62:36] I already was was just like the book
[62:39] didn't gave me a lot more than all the
[62:42] podcast interviews that c did uh because
[62:46] I really like I I watched uh in 2020 and
[62:49] 20121 I probably watched every Michael
[62:52] sailor CA moose uh and a lot more other
[62:55] people people's interviews and podcasts
[62:58] and small pieces and presentations
[63:01] online and that's how I really sucked
[63:03] all the information in me and then in
[63:05] like the last two years I uh try to uh
[63:09] read Al some books and really go a
[63:11] little bit deeper and manifest all the
[63:13] things U so I was quite ready for it but
[63:16] I do think it's not uh the best book to
[63:19] recommend someone for the first time
[63:22] that I I feel like um it it can be too
[63:25] too shocking and too too much for
[63:28] someone uh if they really want to get
[63:30] into yeah I agree cuz I had um like I've
[63:34] never been very educational like
[63:37] literature I don't know how else to put
[63:39] that you know like there's so much like
[63:41] you learn but I learn more by doing or
[63:43] like constantly hearing the same thing
[63:46] you know it's like the same with books
[63:47] like you only really pick up one thing
[63:49] well at least I do so when I read that
[63:51] book I was like damn I need to reread
[63:54] this like three more times because it's
[63:56] so there's so much information and like
[63:58] at the beginning when someone always
[64:00] tells me what like book do you recommend
[64:02] a lot of people say Bitcoin standard
[64:03] book but for me definitely not like you
[64:06] need to people that have no Financial
[64:08] literature like they need to start off
[64:10] like small to then grow to bigger so
[64:13] yeah I love I love that book don't get
[64:15] me wrong especially like the economics
[64:17] and then he released the fat one as well
[64:19] and now there's a food one as well
[64:21] really good stuff but like it's very
[64:24] hard at the beginning and that's why I
[64:25] thought I'd ask you because I found it
[64:27] very hard anyway so yeah there's other
[64:29] better books and as you said audio books
[64:31] as well so yeah um it's it's interesting
[64:34] because I think sain's book is a mustre
[64:38] but not the first one maybe yeah he did
[64:42] yeah
[64:43] sorry please go ahead no I saw that so
[64:47] he tweeted something or either tweeted
[64:50] or like I heard something he said that
[64:52] he prefers his second book which is the
[64:54] fear standard right is that the second
[64:57] one yeah the second one so yeah that
[65:00] just shows but like I think it's a good
[65:02] one just because you know if you're
[65:03] gonna learn I think the number one
[65:05] question when it comes to learning about
[65:06] financial literature is what is money
[65:08] you know and in that book it gives a
[65:11] beautiful example of how it was created
[65:13] and then each point as well I just think
[65:15] it's very hard to grasp in the beginning
[65:18] just because you know you have so many
[65:20] questions and you know it's really hard
[65:22] so but yeah definitely his book is
[65:24] definitely one to recommend
[65:26] you know he's very intelligent so it's
[65:28] really good absolutely and we are
[65:30] already at the end routine uh with you
[65:33] today um the endro team consists of two
[65:36] questions the first is always the same
[65:37] for every guest and the question is what
[65:40] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[65:43] what can you learn from me that's a hard
[65:46] one um I think number one is putting
[65:49] Bitcoin aside try everything in life go
[65:51] out your comfort zone and learn
[65:53] everything in life that you can cuz
[65:55] otherwise you're going to always have
[65:56] that what if in life and you don't want
[65:59] that as a person you got to keep
[66:01] developing because development leaves to
[66:03] other things in life and who knows it
[66:05] just might be something special at the
[66:07] end of the tunnel so yeah go out your
[66:09] comfort zone and always learn new things
[66:11] that's number one definitely I thought
[66:14] you will say how to drive a
[66:17] Lori yeah can you imagine everybody
[66:20] drive a Lori try it then we'll have less
[66:23] idiots on the road I'm
[66:26] joking yeah really really cool the the
[66:29] last end rtin is where the previous
[66:30] guest is asking a question for the next
[66:32] guest without knowing who the next guest
[66:34] actually is the question is really cool
[66:36] for you if you have awakened on any
[66:39] subject areas outside of Bitcoin in the
[66:41] past five years what were those subjects
[66:46] food I know that sounds really weird but
[66:49] like once you start learning about
[66:50] Bitcoin you start learning about other
[66:53] different values like politics
[66:54] governments Financial
[66:56] but then in our family also led us to
[66:58] food the topic of food and actually you
[67:01] have to the number one rule in life if
[67:03] you're ever going to dream of anything
[67:05] is to always be healthy unfortunately in
[67:08] 20 2020 I got diagnosed with an illness
[67:11] and at that time we were still learning
[67:13] about Bitcoin as well and I think that
[67:15] really opened the minds in everyone in
[67:19] my household so from that point our
[67:21] lifestyle and the food we eat and the
[67:25] food we put into US is so important and
[67:28] if you ask any bitcoiner as well
[67:30] actually a lot of people like steak and
[67:32] steak is so good for you you know like
[67:35] the properties it have so I think one
[67:37] thing I've learned from the Bitcoin
[67:39] Journey outside of Bitcoin itself is
[67:41] really take care of yourself and look at
[67:43] the food you eat because a lot of it is
[67:45] processed nowadays because unfortunately
[67:47] our system is so corrupt so yeah the
[67:50] food you eat is the most important
[67:52] because that's what gives you Fuel and
[67:53] that's what gives you the ability to
[67:55] learn about
[67:56] Bitcoin So yeah thank you so much Amilia
[67:59] for for being on uh before I let you go
[68:02] where can people find you and ask your
[68:04] questions uh so you can find me on
[68:06] Twitter Emilia orinska a bit of a weird
[68:09] surname X at the end um I'll will send
[68:12] it to you after and then also maybe in
[68:15] the future I'll be starting my own
[68:17] podcast as well because that's why I
[68:19] really look up to you because you know
[68:21] you gain so much knowledge with so many
[68:23] different people and i' would love to do
[68:25] the same thing just because I'm 21 years
[68:27] old and there's so much that I haven't
[68:29] learned yet and the best way is actually
[68:32] talking to people reaching out to people
[68:34] so yeah you can find me Amelia aansa
