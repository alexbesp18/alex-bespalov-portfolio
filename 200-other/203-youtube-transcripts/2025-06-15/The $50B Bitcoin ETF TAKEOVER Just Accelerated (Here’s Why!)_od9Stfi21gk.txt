[00:00] What we actually have now with this
[00:01] Bitcoin bill is that they're attempting
[00:03] to fast track that. I expect rapid
[00:05] adoption, but you know, I also said that
[00:07] after El Salvador in 2021 or two, and I
[00:09] I was kind of wrong about that, too.
[00:11] It's different now that we're that we're
[00:13] talking about America doing it. You
[00:14] know, 35 reserve bills that have been
[00:17] introduced across 23 states and
[00:19] federally and in all the other
[00:21] legislation beyond the reserve bills.
[00:23] Um, I wanted a way to track this and to
[00:25] kind of map it and to keep tabs on it
[00:27] and also to report on it and kind of get
[00:28] the accurate information out there um
[00:30] about what's happening and started a
[00:31] website bitcoin laws.io. The fact that
[00:34] Larry Frink becoming one of the biggest
[00:36] Bitcoin promoters in the world, like
[00:38] what more do you need to say? Now, many
[00:40] of these giant players like Morgan
[00:42] Stanley, they actually haven't even yet
[00:44] to this day started to proactively sell
[00:47] the spot bitcoin ETFs. They've been
[00:49] procluded from doing that. When big
[00:51] powerful wealthy people are not paying
[00:54] attention to you at all, that means you
[00:56] are irrelevant. When powerful wealthy
[00:59] people are paying a lot of attention to
[01:01] you, that means you are relevant. I
[01:03] think it's a sign of Bitcoin's
[01:05] [Music]
[01:08] victory. Um, I saw something. I don't
[01:11] know if this was actually the last time
[01:12] already in there, but you saw you have
[01:15] golden age and choy in your Twitter and
[01:19] I actually just saw it last minute when
[01:21] I looked at your profile. What is that
[01:24] golden age that like
[01:26] uh I mean it's so it's a bit of a tongue
[01:29] and cheek reference to the idea that
[01:34] um I'm not sure who coined it. I think
[01:36] it was picked up by
[01:40] um the like the Trump administration
[01:43] talking about Bitcoin and this kind of
[01:45] new era of Bitcoin and digital assets
[01:47] and other things, but this idea that
[01:48] we'd be entering entering a golden age
[01:52] um now. Um and um you know I kind of
[01:55] obviously in a certain sense I do
[01:57] believe that um but so it's it's a bit
[02:00] of a meme that um this is the kind of
[02:02] the dawn of a golden age. You're
[02:04] enjoying the the Trump Trump golden age
[02:07] that is coming up. Well, I mean, look,
[02:09] we can talk about that. It's uh the
[02:11] first few weeks have been um a little
[02:14] bit less golden than than probably a lot
[02:15] of the market and myself predicted, but
[02:18] um but obviously broadly optimistic, of
[02:20] course. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.
[02:23] Actually, um I I usually start with
[02:25] returning guests of of uh what's your
[02:28] kind of your highlight in in in since we
[02:30] last recorded. I think last recording is
[02:32] is at least a year now uh away. So it
[02:36] was I think around the ETF launch uh
[02:39] time when we last recorded and now it's
[02:41] kind of the strategic Bitcoin reserve
[02:44] launch time now. Um what kind of is your
[02:47] highlight? What stands out for you in
[02:48] the in the in the last year? So I think
[02:50] I think still I would say the big the
[02:52] biggest highlight
[02:54] um of the past year thinking about I
[02:56] guess the the entire 12 months would be
[02:59] would be the ETF launches. Um, you know,
[03:03] I I had a strong sense beforehand that
[03:06] they would be they would be important
[03:07] and they would be meaningful and they
[03:09] would be a big story in Bitcoin. Um, so
[03:12] I was a bull, a big ETF bull before they
[03:14] launched. And even I was wrong about
[03:16] just how impactful uh they have been
[03:20] about how successful those launches
[03:22] were. Uh, you know, I think it's like
[03:24] tens of tens of billion maybe $40
[03:26] million of like net um inflows to to the
[03:29] Bitcoin ETFs. the most successful ETF
[03:32] launches ever of any ETFs by a long way
[03:37] um in the you know in the first 12
[03:38] months. Um
[03:41] so just that you know they were
[03:44] successful in and of themselves but of
[03:45] course it's like brought bigger than
[03:47] that. What do they represent? It's the
[03:49] the the beginning of this age of comp
[03:53] you know I I would call it capitulation
[03:56] to Bitcoin. That's what institutional
[03:58] adoption is right. Um, some people have
[04:01] different views on that, but I think
[04:03] it's like this is that it was such a big
[04:06] milestone in my view along the path to
[04:09] Bitcoin's complete and total
[04:12] victory. The fact that um, you know,
[04:15] Larry Frink becoming one of the biggest
[04:17] Bitcoin promoters in the world, like
[04:19] what more do you need to say? And so
[04:20] that that I think would be like
[04:22] highlight number one of the past year.
[04:24] Uh obviously the presidential election
[04:28] results were were massive. However,
[04:30] however which way it plays out TBC um I
[04:33] think of quite clearly in a very
[04:35] positive direction for
[04:37] Bitcoin. Yeah, that's a bit more
[04:40] prospective, but I think that that would
[04:41] be a highlight too. And yeah, I think so
[04:44] so big big year for institutional
[04:46] adoption for for political adoption. Um,
[04:49] and I think the kind of final like
[04:51] withering away of the last vestigages of
[04:55] kind of Bitcoin FUD, really any serious
[04:58] legitimate FUD in any
[05:00] direction, it's a it's a it's a it's a
[05:04] normalization and acceptance of of
[05:06] Bitcoin while now uh nation states and
[05:10] corporations talking about it. That's
[05:11] it's a really good one. Um because I saw
[05:14] also uh you covering a lot of ETFs last
[05:17] year. Um what do you expect kind of from
[05:20] the second year? I I heard a lot of like
[05:22] ETFs need some time to really get going.
[05:25] Uh there's some processes. It's it's not
[05:28] like
[05:29] a if family businesses and and bigger
[05:32] businesses and institutions and high end
[05:34] of individuals by the ETF. There's
[05:36] usually like a process. It's like
[05:38] quarterto quarter. They also like to see
[05:41] like bigger uh time frames when the pro
[05:44] product was already launched. So they
[05:46] don't want to be in the first six
[05:48] months. They want to be like when it's
[05:49] already a little bit older. How big do
[05:52] you foresee the the second and the third
[05:54] and the four fifth year be for for
[05:57] Bitcoin and ETFs. So it's hard to put a
[05:59] number on it, but I would say very big.
[06:01] Um and I think you know even though as
[06:04] as I just said the the ETFs were such an
[06:07] enormous success in year one um these
[06:10] things do take time to percolate um new
[06:14] products like this do take time to
[06:16] percolate through the system as you
[06:17] mentioned um in and then in in tangible
[06:20] ways that we already know about right
[06:21] like there are massive um what are
[06:24] called wirehouse institutions like kind
[06:27] of Morgan Stanley's of the world who
[06:29] have enormous networks
[06:31] of uh you know financial advisers in
[06:35] essence who it's it is their job to
[06:39] basically pick up the phone and talk to
[06:42] all of the um all of the kind of clients
[06:46] and customers in you know in the
[06:47] enormous Morgan Stanley network right
[06:49] and so this is the kind of distribution
[06:51] network for for these for these ETFs now
[06:56] many of these giant uh players like
[06:59] Morgan Stanley they actually have even
[07:01] yet to this day started to proactively
[07:03] sell the spot bitcoin ETFs. They've been
[07:07] procluded from doing that. Right? So,
[07:08] they've obviously there's kind of a case
[07:11] by case um variation here, but but
[07:13] really what we've seen is
[07:15] um they're allowed to sell them if they
[07:17] get inbound interest. Um but but in
[07:21] terms of packaging these spot bitcoin
[07:22] ETFs up into to kind of outbound
[07:26] proactive sales pitches and then a
[07:28] variety of other ways that they can be
[07:30] packaged up into kind of other index
[07:32] products and everything else like all of
[07:33] these things do take time. The many of
[07:35] these steps haven't haven't occurred
[07:38] yet, right? So so there is
[07:40] still an enormous on-ramp that is being
[07:43] kind of progressed through just to get
[07:45] the ETF distribution network up and
[07:48] running. Um and so I guess that's on the
[07:50] side of of the distribution and then you
[07:52] look at the side of the demand too.
[07:54] There are you know several really
[07:56] interesting stories of different
[07:57] institutions um over the past year and
[08:00] then even the past couple of months who
[08:02] have kind of emerged as big ETF buyers.
[08:05] Um so so just two by way of reference
[08:08] would be um the kind of pension funds in
[08:12] the United States.
[08:14] So I think we've got Wisconsin and
[08:15] Michigan two states that have allocated
[08:17] to to Bitcoin ETFs so far. So that's
[08:20] just two states right out of out of 50.
[08:23] Um and then and then you know in fairly
[08:26] modest allocations themselves. So the
[08:29] pension just just the public pension
[08:31] fund market itself is worth about $6
[08:34] trillion in the United States. So that's
[08:37] really just the tip, not even the tip of
[08:39] the iceberg there just for one class of
[08:42] investor. And then of course you have I
[08:44] think it was the was it the Abu Dhabi
[08:46] sovereign wealth fund in kind of the Q4
[08:48] filings that emerged too. So um on the
[08:51] demand side you can see that there are
[08:53] all these classes of investors that have
[08:56] only just started to to break in as
[08:58] well. So when I think you you imagine
[09:00] you kind of forecast out from that you
[09:03] know this kind of apples to apples
[09:04] comparison of like all right well who
[09:05] else looks like those investors and and
[09:07] are are not yet on the network and then
[09:11] on the supply side on the distribution
[09:13] side well all getting all that
[09:15] infrastructure built which still hasn't
[09:17] happened then I think year two year
[09:20] three year four it's going to
[09:23] be it's going to be big um will it be
[09:26] continuous record-breaking quarters
[09:27] every time, you know, I I don't know,
[09:29] but I think it's going to be, you know,
[09:32] the right analogy, I think, is to the
[09:33] what happened with gold after the gold
[09:35] ETFs launched, right? Um, this wasn't
[09:38] just a kind of like a one-time
[09:39] repricing. It was like an 8-year
[09:41] unbroken bull market or something, you
[09:43] know, 20 2004 to 2012, I think, you
[09:47] know, unbroken bull market for for gold.
[09:49] And I think something like that you
[09:51] would expect to happen. Um, not to say
[09:55] that like BTC itself that Bitcoin is
[09:57] going to be kind of up only forever, but
[10:00] certainly with regards to like ETF
[10:02] adoption, I think it's just there's so
[10:05] much pentup demand that I think, you
[10:07] know, it's going to take a long time for
[10:09] it to all get online.
[10:12] Yeah. And and it's kind of amazing when
[10:14] you think about the the hurdles that the
[10:16] Bitcoin ETF launch had. Uh I just think
[10:18] about Vanguard not not not kind of
[10:22] wanting that product at all and it was
[10:25] still the most successful ETF launch. Uh
[10:28] so it's it's it's kind of amazing with
[10:31] so much fud with so much um opposition
[10:35] against Bitcoin. It was still the most
[10:37] successful one. uh that that is kind of
[10:40] for me of like okay maybe year two three
[10:43] four is actually the real like huge
[10:47] amount of of wealth comes actually
[10:48] through the ETFs into Bitcoin which is
[10:51] it's kind of exciting honestly like the
[10:53] the adoption wave and those things take
[10:56] time it's it's it's a product in in year
[10:58] one it was
[10:59] already a really successful one I I I do
[11:02] agree with you here a lot yeah for sure
[11:06] absolutely um you also
[11:08] uh building now something new is the the
[11:11] the Bitcoin laws. Uh what is that?
[11:15] Yeah. So, Bitcoin Laws started as well
[11:20] is it's a kind of a side project that I
[11:22] started a couple of months ago, maybe
[11:24] not even six weeks ago, um as an attempt
[11:27] to try and track all of the legislation
[11:31] that started to get introduced across
[11:34] the United States really um as the kind
[11:37] of congressional
[11:39] um sessions began in 2025. So there was
[11:43] there was this um it's it's slowed down
[11:46] a little bit with the the the kind of
[11:48] volume of new legislation being
[11:49] introduced although there is still more
[11:51] there are still more bills being
[11:53] introduced but what we saw in the first
[11:54] couple of months of the year was states
[11:57] all over the country introducing a
[11:59] variety of bills cons you know
[12:02] regulating ostensively Bitcoin and other
[12:04] digital assets. uh many of them state
[12:06] level strategic Bitcoin reserve bills or
[12:10] or attempts at reserve bills or you know
[12:13] depending on your definition but
[12:15] something approaching a reserve bill and
[12:17] so I started I started seeing some news
[12:19] of this um found it uh challenging to
[12:23] kind of get a hold of all the details of
[12:24] all of these bills myself and just keep
[12:26] track of them right because I think now
[12:28] um I mean I'm updating it daily but I
[12:30] think now there are you know 35 reserve
[12:34] reserve bills that have been introduced
[12:36] across 23 states and federally. Um, and
[12:39] then if you add in all the other
[12:40] legislation beyond the reserve bills,
[12:44] um, mo all of which I haven't yet fully
[12:46] captured, but we're in the range of, you
[12:48] know, 80 to 100 different pieces of
[12:49] legislation,
[12:51] um, that are that are currently in
[12:53] flight. So, um, I wanted a way to track
[12:55] this and to kind of map it and to keep
[12:57] tabs on it, um, and also to report on it
[13:00] and kind of get the get accurate
[13:02] information out there, um, about what's
[13:03] happening. and so started a started a
[13:05] website bitcoinaws.io
[13:07] uh to to do that. You are also a lawyer
[13:11] if I remember correctly. Yeah, I I was a
[13:14] lawyer. Uh I started my career in the in
[13:17] the legal profession and so and that was
[13:19] that was part of it too where
[13:21] um I was seeing some you know headlines
[13:24] and and reporting around you know
[13:27] alleged strategic Bitcoin reserves but
[13:29] of course that you know the devil is
[13:30] always in the detail. And so as I as I'd
[13:33] learned myself through um many many
[13:35] hours of looking through legislation of
[13:38] different varieties and so I just
[13:40] started I wanted to dig in a little bit
[13:42] more and and dug into the details and um
[13:45] uh and then yeah my my kind of lawyer
[13:48] brain compelled me to to try and report
[13:52] a little bit more precisely on what was
[13:53] going on. Yeah, I think I will I will
[13:57] pull that uh that side up. I think it's
[13:59] it's it's really interesting one. Um, so
[14:02] that's basically the USA. Uh, and we can
[14:06] see here now like Texas bills, uh, the
[14:10] New Mexico bills, the the Arizona
[14:12] Bitcoin bills and and what state there
[14:16] it's it's kind of fascinating how many
[14:18] there actually are like what is what is
[14:20] total measures like 80. Yeah. So that's
[14:23] the the total measure measure is kind of
[14:25] a a kind of catch all term for the
[14:29] different pieces of legislation, right?
[14:31] So um what I've tracked so far um
[14:33] although there there are some others to
[14:35] add are um 80 different pieces of
[14:37] legislation that are that are most of
[14:40] them are in flight. A couple have
[14:41] already either failed or or have been
[14:43] enacted. Um but you know 80 pieces of
[14:46] legislation and I guess to give a little
[14:47] bit more detail there. So I think people
[14:50] are familiar with the strategic Bitcoin
[14:52] reserve and what that does, but there
[14:54] are lots of other different ways that um
[14:58] state legislatures are looking at
[15:01] regulating Bitcoin right now or just you
[15:03] know it's it's relevant to consider
[15:04] right so there are how is it treated
[15:07] from a taxation perspective um different
[15:10] kind of commercial codes you know
[15:12] relating to kind of money usage and
[15:14] other things. Um how are miners treated?
[15:17] How are how are mining facilities
[15:19] regulated? Um what you know what
[15:21] protections are there for self-custody
[15:24] rights? Um, so there are a lot of you I
[15:27] think some Bitcoiners don't like to talk
[15:28] about this, but as it's just inevitable
[15:31] in my view, um, and we're seeing this
[15:33] play out as as Bitcoin becomes enshed
[15:37] with the with this state with the kind
[15:41] of with organizing uh, you know, of
[15:44] humans amongst each other in the form of
[15:45] governments.
[15:47] All of these issues remain to be worked
[15:48] out and so there are, you know, numerous
[15:52] different ways that regulations will
[15:54] inevitably have to confront Bitcoin. So
[15:57] that's what the total measures part is
[15:59] like starting to capture that
[16:02] holistically. Um, and then the rest of
[16:04] it is, you know, obviously people are
[16:06] most excited about this the the Bitcoin
[16:08] reserves too. So, um, you know, having
[16:11] taken in a bit of feedback over the past
[16:13] few weeks, I've kind of added in some
[16:14] some filters to just drill down on the
[16:17] reserves more specifically, too.
[16:20] Well, uh, and what is different is is
[16:24] live SPR something they already passed
[16:26] or uh, no, although that's a good
[16:28] question. Yeah, I might need to to think
[16:30] about the best way to to phrase that,
[16:31] but SBR's introduced is just any any SB
[16:36] that has been introduced. Now, of
[16:37] course, some of them have already
[16:38] failed. They they at a certain point
[16:40] along the legislative process. They
[16:43] either didn't make it um out of what's
[16:44] called kind of committee stage or they
[16:46] made it to a vote and and were voted
[16:48] down. And so there were there have been
[16:50] 35 of those that have kind of been
[16:53] initiated and then uh I think well based
[16:56] on these numbers there have been six six
[16:58] that haven't made it u and and so
[17:00] therefore 29 um are still alive. Still
[17:04] still some prospects of success there.
[17:07] Interesting. Oh, and and you also put
[17:09] like a state reserve race. Uh so like
[17:13] which one it'll be f fastest there.
[17:16] Interesting. Exactly. Yeah. So if you if
[17:18] you kind of scroll down to the bottom
[17:20] there, you can see um some of those that
[17:23] have failed. Um there are there are five
[17:25] there. The sixth one I mentioned a sixth
[17:28] SBI bill that quote unquote failed. that
[17:31] was um Cynthia Lumis' original Bitcoin
[17:33] Act bill from last year. So when she
[17:35] introduced the at the at the federal
[17:37] level, so the the chart the the kind of
[17:39] diagram you're looking at now is just
[17:40] looking at the states. Um so that's why
[17:42] the you know 2024 Bitcoin Act isn't on
[17:45] there. Um but when you when you take
[17:47] into account these states here plus last
[17:49] year's Bitcoin Act, that that's your
[17:51] kind of six six that haven't made it
[17:53] through. But everything else, as you can
[17:54] see, is is still alive um with a bit of
[17:57] a distribution of progress. So, um
[18:01] Arizona currently there's two two bills
[18:03] in the Senate um that are progressing
[18:05] through. They are kind of the furthest
[18:07] advanced. Um Texas um is at a similar
[18:11] stage but seems to have a lot of
[18:12] momentum and I think probably the most
[18:16] optimism
[18:17] um about about Texas passing and then
[18:20] yeah, you can see New Hampshire,
[18:22] Oklahoma, Florida kind of trailing
[18:23] behind. What What is the what is the
[18:26] bill that makes you uh most bullish?
[18:28] like what what is the the the biggest
[18:30] one in here that you you kind of see
[18:32] having a a huge impact on Bitcoin? That
[18:34] is a good question.
[18:36] So, I'll say this. Um there's kind of a
[18:39] hidden element to some of these some of
[18:41] these bills. So, on the one hand, I
[18:43] think like I I love the idea of
[18:45] strategic Bitcoin reserves. Um because,
[18:49] you know, for all of the reasons, I
[18:51] think it's just smart policy for for
[18:54] state treasurers to invest in Bitcoin as
[18:56] it is for anybody. Um and it you know
[18:58] and it it's further legitimization of
[19:00] Bitcoin further you know further
[19:02] adoption and normalization as you um
[19:04] phrased earlier but of
[19:07] course people one thing people may not
[19:10] understand about the states is they
[19:12] don't actually have that much money all
[19:14] things considered um you talk about
[19:16] moving the needle of Bitcoin you know
[19:19] price overall contribution to market cap
[19:21] some do you know Texas isn't Texas is a
[19:23] really big state so is Florida um but
[19:25] there's a big there's there's a big
[19:27] range And even then the amount of money
[19:29] that's kind of proposed in these
[19:31] reserves um it's tends to range between
[19:34] you know five and 10% of certain
[19:37] publicly available funds. Um I haven't
[19:40] gone yet through everything and and run
[19:43] the numbers to to actually kind of uh
[19:45] translate through what what would be the
[19:47] actual investable impact although that
[19:49] is on my road map. But I'll say this
[19:51] like generally speaking it's not a one
[19:53] state is not like a needle mover for you
[19:56] know because Bitcoin is is is a mature
[19:57] asset class. Having said that, something
[20:00] that people haven't really
[20:04] um fully groed yet is that much probably
[20:09] more importantly than the state
[20:13] treasurers investing is the potential
[20:16] pool of capital at the state level that
[20:19] sits with and I mentioned this before
[20:21] the pension funds. So every state has
[20:23] pension funds for, you know, public
[20:25] employees of of various kinds. And what
[20:28] tends to be the case is there's actually
[20:30] a lot more capital, like tens of
[20:31] billions of dollars sitting in sitting
[20:34] in these pension funds at the state
[20:35] level, much more so in many cases than
[20:37] is kind of proposed to be investable in
[20:40] these Bitcoin reserves. So to answer
[20:43] your question of like which bills may be
[20:44] more bullish, some of them also include
[20:48] um explicit authorization for the
[20:50] pension funds to invest. Some of them
[20:53] don't. Some states have completely
[20:55] separate bills for like pension fund
[20:57] authorization. And some states don't
[20:59] even require you know legislative
[21:01] authorization at all. Wisconsin and
[21:03] Michigan being two examples. But um I
[21:07] guess this is a roundabout way way of
[21:08] saying what is the most bullish change
[21:10] that can happen at the state level for
[21:12] Bitcoin investment. In my view, it would
[21:15] be at the level of um retirement funds
[21:18] and pension funds investing.
[21:20] Interesting. Uh that that website is
[21:23] really nice. uh you have a nice uh
[21:25] overview and then I wasn't aware that
[21:28] there's so much going on honestly like I
[21:31] I I I didn't look at the website beforeh
[21:34] starting this podcast uh and with this
[21:36] website I kind of I thought there's like
[21:39] two free states there's some some bills
[21:41] going on there are way more than I
[21:45] honestly there's a ton yeah there's
[21:47] there's really a ton and I think well
[21:50] I'm fascinated by it because I'm um I'm
[21:53] watching it every day and reporting on
[21:54] it. But I think Bitcoiners would be too
[21:57] if they were aware that all this stuff
[21:58] was going on every day. I'm doing my
[22:00] best to kind of get that information out
[22:02] there. But, you know, I'll give you an
[22:03] example from just from yesterday. And I
[22:05] didn't end up, you know, I was doing
[22:06] other things, didn't have time to report
[22:07] on it, but there is a Bitcoin reserve
[22:09] bill currently
[22:12] uh live in Maryland in the state of
[22:14] Maryland and there was a there was a
[22:16] public hearing with the relevant
[22:18] committee who's considering this bill
[22:20] right now in Maryland. And there was
[22:23] public testimony on this for and
[22:24] against. And I think on the for side um
[22:27] there was um uh Satoshi Action Fund um
[22:32] it wasn't Dennis Porter, but that's
[22:33] Dennis Porter's kind of advocacy group
[22:35] who's who's doing a lot of work here. Um
[22:38] his name might be Jason, but I'm not
[22:39] sure. But there's a representative from
[22:41] Satoshi Action Fund speaking in favor of
[22:44] the bill. But then there was somebody
[22:46] speaking against. they'd found a local
[22:48] accountant or someone who was like a you
[22:50] know huge nocoiner um uh and just
[22:52] talking you know testifying in public
[22:54] about how Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme and
[22:56] all this kind of silly stuff and so I
[22:58] think um you know was there a lot of
[23:01] like new interesting information in that
[23:03] maybe not but I I think Bitcoiners
[23:06] should be aware that these debates are
[23:10] happening all around the country um in
[23:12] the United States and probably other
[23:14] places too every day um and it is kind
[23:17] of materially affecting how this
[23:18] legislation is being interpreted and
[23:21] perceived by by politicians and
[23:24] legislators. Um so yeah, there is a lot
[23:28] of action on a daily basis. That that's
[23:30] amazing. Uh that that's actually uh
[23:34] surprises me almost. It it also makes me
[23:36] a little bit sad of
[23:38] seeing that I don't see the same action
[23:40] in
[23:41] Europe. That's the thing. Yeah.
[23:46] the sorry go ahead. No, no, go for it.
[23:49] Oh, I was just saying uh of uh if you
[23:53] have the the the the plans of maybe
[23:57] expanding that worldwide of like okay
[23:59] let's let's add all states but also like
[24:02] do an international type of like okay
[24:05] maybe because Czech Republic I know the
[24:07] the central bank said something like
[24:09] that there will be probably like
[24:10] examples that you can add in here and
[24:13] see like okay what's the progress there?
[24:15] Yeah, there are many examples. Um, and
[24:18] the short answer is that I would love to
[24:20] expand internationally. Um, it's just
[24:23] just a kind of a question of time and
[24:26] um, but I'm I'm certainly at at some
[24:29] point I'm certain that at some point I
[24:31] will.
[24:32] Um, it's it's just a question of when
[24:35] and how. The great thing about the US is
[24:38] that u there are really good data
[24:40] sources. So you know the great like kind
[24:42] of public APIs and other data sources
[24:44] where I can like get a lot of this
[24:45] information in a systematic fashion. Um
[24:48] whereas when you when you branch out
[24:50] then to saying all right let's let's
[24:51] cover the globe um it it becomes a more
[24:54] of a kind of hunting game um case by
[24:57] case basis and then what I suspect would
[25:01] be kind of man a lot more manual
[25:02] tracking um but for sure this is a you
[25:07] know it's a global it's a global
[25:08] phenomenon certainly at the legislative
[25:10] level as you said it would be nice if
[25:12] there were more more explicitly positive
[25:14] developments happening in the EU and
[25:15] other places um I I don't see those, but
[25:18] also I haven't I haven't maybe looked
[25:20] hard enough yet. So So we'll see. It's
[25:24] kind of fascinating when we think about
[25:26] okay 2021 Salvador I think was the first
[25:30] officially strategic Bitcoin reserve uh
[25:33] country. Uh then we had Budhan uh which
[25:38] the the country I think started already
[25:41] in 2019 so uh before El Salvador but
[25:45] they only announced it in like last year
[25:48] somewhere uh like not even six or seven
[25:51] months ago or something like that. Um
[25:53] and now we have the the USA which is
[25:56] totally crazy that the USA is now now
[25:59] following. Um what what do you expect
[26:02] for country level strategic Bitcoin
[26:05] reserve in in the coming years when you
[26:07] see that like it took 15 years for the
[26:09] first one then like three more years for
[26:11] the second one then half a year for the
[26:14] third one it seems like exponential
[26:15] growth.
[26:17] Yeah I I expect rapid adoption um but
[26:22] you know I also said that after El
[26:23] Salvador in 2021 or two and I I was kind
[26:26] of wrong about that too. Obviously the
[26:29] it's different now that we're that we're
[26:31] talking about America doing it. Um I
[26:34] think
[26:35] what what I understand to be happening
[26:39] right now is that there all these
[26:41] conversations are happening behind
[26:42] closed doors. Um so and they take time.
[26:47] So I'm it wouldn't surprise me at all if
[26:49] there were you know several other nation
[26:51] states with with processes already
[26:54] underway. some announcement to some
[26:56] announcements coming you know over the
[26:57] next 12 months um and regardless of what
[27:01] the US was doing right but I think now
[27:04] that we have this reserve officially
[27:09] created in the US and with the potential
[27:12] too
[27:13] of not just um you know with the
[27:17] executive order but actually
[27:19] getting the uh congressional bills
[27:22] through most importantly
[27:24] from both Cynthia Lumis in the Senate
[27:26] and then there is a there's now a House
[27:28] bill
[27:29] equivalent. I think if those pass well I
[27:34] guess there there are two there are a
[27:35] couple of parts to this question is like
[27:36] one what does America look like and then
[27:39] two what does the rest of the world do
[27:40] in
[27:41] response what I'll say is this the the
[27:44] executive order SPR signed by Trump um
[27:48] is great and I think the way that it was
[27:49] drafted is is is great um considering
[27:53] the different ways that it could have
[27:55] gone um I think it's a well-drafted
[27:57] executive
[27:58] order but the power of the president
[28:01] himself or herself to not only create a
[28:05] reserve but then initiate a a like a
[28:10] buying program at scale is fairly
[28:12] limited. Um and not only is a power
[28:15] fairly limited but it's also somewhat
[28:17] vulnerable. The thing about executive
[28:19] orders is they can be you know they can
[28:21] be done they can be enacted with the
[28:23] stroke of a pen and they can also be
[28:24] undone with the stroke of a pen. Right?
[28:26] So you can imagine a world in which um a
[28:29] Democrat politician who is anti- Bitcoin
[28:31] gets elected in 2028 and then you know
[28:34] day one executive order um we're
[28:36] scrapping this SPR like that's
[28:37] completely feasible. That could totally
[28:39] happen. On the other hand, what's a lot
[28:42] harder to undo are uh uh bills that have
[28:48] been enacted through Congress. And so to
[28:52] me, I'm kind of much more excited in a
[28:54] way to see what happens with the the
[28:57] House and Senate bills um if they get
[29:00] passed. Not only would that further
[29:02] codify the existence of the strategic
[29:05] Bitcoin reserve, but it also has a much
[29:08] better shot at
[29:10] at basically appropriating the funds
[29:13] required to embark on on the on the
[29:17] stated plan of acquiring 1 million BTC,
[29:20] right? Acquiring 1 million BTC is not
[29:22] something that Trump is going to be able
[29:24] to do himself. So, it's going to require
[29:25] the passage of these bills to do that.
[29:29] Um, will they get through? I'm I'm not
[29:31] sure. Um, but if they do, it would be
[29:34] great for, you know, for the reasons I
[29:36] said. Much harder to undo. There's a lot
[29:37] more political legitimacy. Um, and then
[29:39] I think it's just kind of done. Now, if
[29:42] that happens, then like to some degree,
[29:46] I think the Trump SPR already should be
[29:48] like a game on moment for the rest of
[29:49] the world. Like it should be, but I'm
[29:51] saying this as a Bitcoiner. Like my view
[29:53] is like you're if you're a country not
[29:55] considering this now, you're you're out
[29:56] of your mind. But I would say if the
[29:59] Bitcoin act gets passed, then it's like
[30:03] it's more than the cherry on top. It's
[30:05] like all systems go like rockets are
[30:08] firing 1 million BTC is like getting
[30:11] sucked up or or more um you know into
[30:14] America's coffers for the long term. And
[30:17] so then that's the kind of thing where I
[30:19] would say like my base case would be
[30:25] massive
[30:27] worldwide race to acquire Bitcoin at the
[30:30] nation state level. Let's take a break
[30:32] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[30:35] that coin vigilante has made with the
[30:38] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[30:40] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[30:43] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[30:46] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[30:49] completely new and amazing Genesis
[30:51] edition of their watch collections. You
[30:54] have the date of the first ever minded
[30:57] Bitcoin block in there. And of course,
[31:00] also the block height and which epoch we
[31:03] are currently in. I love the level of
[31:06] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[31:09] Make sure to check out those amazing
[31:11] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[31:14] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[31:17] much. And now, if you have Bitcoin, I
[31:20] really do hope that you don't have it on
[31:22] exchange. But if you do have it on
[31:24] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[31:26] deal with that. The first way is you put
[31:28] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[31:30] entry for you to get into the
[31:32] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[31:36] Bitcoin only edition. For that, it's a
[31:38] super simple and secure way. And if you
[31:41] check out the link in the description,
[31:43] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[31:46] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:49] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[31:52] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:55] out of your sovereignty. They will
[31:58] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[32:01] that is perfect for your individual
[32:04] situation. They will show you how you
[32:06] can secure your own devices. Securing
[32:09] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[32:11] have to keep all your devices secure.
[32:13] One topic that is overlooked often is
[32:16] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[32:18] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[32:21] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[32:24] place already? And last but not least,
[32:26] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[32:28] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[32:30] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[32:35] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:38] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:41] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:43] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:46] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:49] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:51] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:53] the link down in the description of
[32:56] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:58] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[33:02] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[33:03] there. Is that Bill? Because uh the
[33:08] Republicans and I I I don't know the the
[33:12] the election system in in America that
[33:15] good and and the law system. Um but from
[33:18] what I understand they have the house
[33:19] and the senate uh and the president. Um
[33:22] so if he um wants to pass it in uh and
[33:27] it seems like he goes more and more in
[33:29] that direction h it it should be able to
[33:32] actually pass in in in the time where he
[33:34] is president. So then if it passes the
[33:37] they kind of acquire a million bitcoin
[33:40] uh from what I understand. Yeah. Yeah.
[33:42] Exactly. So I guess I'll I'll give a
[33:44] little happy to give you a little more
[33:45] context there. So, um, so I will say
[33:48] that the text of these bills hasn't been
[33:50] released yet, but from what I
[33:51] understand, I think Senator Lumis said
[33:54] yesterday that they're substantively the
[33:56] same as has her bill from last year. And
[33:59] what was proposed in that bill was a
[34:02] 5-year plan to acquire 1 million BTC,
[34:04] 200 200,000 a year, um, with a kind of
[34:08] minimum um, huddle time of 20 years. So,
[34:12] no selling, you know, for for at least
[34:14] 20 years. Um, and then some other things
[34:16] there, you know, protection of of
[34:17] custody
[34:18] rights, you know, there are other things
[34:20] just beyond like let's go buy some
[34:21] Bitcoin. It's kind of a holistic Bitcoin
[34:24] act, right? But those are the headline
[34:26] numbers. 1 million 1 million BDC over 5
[34:28] years.
[34:30] Um, now I guess to the kind of uh
[34:33] process side kind of um and yeah, maybe
[34:36] a brief 101 on on American civics is
[34:40] that um for a for a bill to get passed
[34:43] into law at the federal level or at the
[34:46] state level, they basically have the
[34:47] same same system. There are, you know,
[34:49] you have you have two um chambers of
[34:52] Congress. You have the House of
[34:53] Representatives and then you have the
[34:54] Senate. And for any bill to get passed
[34:57] into law, it has to pass through both of
[35:00] those. So like first, you know, let's
[35:02] say Senator Lumis introduces her bill
[35:04] into the Senate. It has to go through
[35:06] several processes. Um has to kind of be
[35:08] considered by by kind of relevant
[35:10] committee um first. So I can't remember
[35:14] what it's called, but it's like that,
[35:14] you know, financial services committee
[35:16] in the Senate has to get approved by
[35:18] that. Then it goes to a full vote of the
[35:19] Senate. Has to like kind of make it
[35:22] through the Senate, get get passed. Then
[35:25] it has to do all of that again in the
[35:26] House. So it has to pass through both
[35:28] chambers of Congress. Then after doing
[35:31] all of that, it would go to Donald
[35:33] Trump's desk for signature and then it
[35:36] becomes law. Um that's the standard
[35:40] process. What we actually have now with
[35:42] this Bitcoin bill is that they've kind
[35:44] of they're attempting to fasttrack that.
[35:47] And so uh as I said, the standard
[35:50] process would be one bill introduced in
[35:52] one chamber. it makes it through the
[35:53] first one and then makes it through the
[35:56] second one. There is a way to kind of
[35:58] short circuit that a little bit where
[35:59] you introduce the same bill concurrently
[36:01] at the same time in both houses. And so
[36:04] it kind of makes it through all the way,
[36:06] you know, in both of them at the same
[36:07] time gets passed and then you just kind
[36:09] of reconcile any little differences that
[36:11] there might be at the end and it
[36:13] basically speeds the process up. That's
[36:15] what's happening now with with the
[36:17] Bitcoin Act. So that's why you've seen
[36:19] it been introduced in both the Senate
[36:20] and the House at the same time. Um so to
[36:24] your to your question about like u I
[36:26] guess impact of the election. So the
[36:29] Republicans these are Republican bills
[36:31] by the way. So they've been introduced
[36:33] by and sponsored kind of co-sponsored by
[36:36] Republicans in both the Senate and the
[36:37] House. And the Republicans have
[36:39] majorities in both the Senate and the
[36:41] House. Um as well as of course
[36:43] controlling the White House. So all of
[36:45] that, so superficially, the prospects of
[36:49] success are certainly a lot better than
[36:51] than last year when that wasn't the
[36:53] case. Um, but it's not guaranteed. Um,
[36:57] it's not as if being pro Bitcoin is like
[37:00] a universally accepted party platform
[37:04] position of every Republican legislator
[37:07] at any level, state or federal. That's
[37:10] not the case at all. Um, so there there
[37:12] most likely will be some Republican
[37:15] opposition. Um, and the reason I can say
[37:17] this confidently is because we've
[37:18] already seen that at the state level,
[37:20] right? Um,
[37:22] so you know, I probably the probably the
[37:25] best example of that is Utah. Um, Utah
[37:28] had were were until about a week ago a
[37:30] really good candidate for passing a
[37:32] strategic Bitcoin reserve bill. Um they
[37:35] had one pass. They had a house bill that
[37:38] uh
[37:39] ultimately it it
[37:42] it technically speaking it passed. Um
[37:46] but in order to pass the bill what they
[37:48] had to do was like strip out all the
[37:49] Bitcoin reserve stuff. So as a Bitcoin
[37:52] reserve bill it failed. And the reason
[37:54] why it failed was because there was so
[37:56] much opposition to all the Bitcoin
[37:57] reserve stuff. And this is despite Utah
[38:01] having a really strong Republican
[38:02] majority. So, and again, stop me if I'm
[38:05] like getting too far into the weeds
[38:06] here, but basically the the bill passed
[38:08] the House on a very like on a very slim
[38:10] margin, like I think it was like 30 38
[38:13] votes to 34 or something like that, but
[38:15] the Republicans had a much actually
[38:17] stronger majority than that in the
[38:18] House. So, what does that tell you? It
[38:20] tells you that there were a bunch of
[38:21] Republicans voting against this bill.
[38:23] And I actually posted about it from um
[38:25] from the kind of Bitcoin Laws X account
[38:28] where there are there are videos of this
[38:30] testimony, right? And so you can see
[38:31] that there are a bunch of Republican
[38:33] legislators who even though, you know,
[38:36] they are nominally on the pro Bitcoin
[38:38] side, they still have reservations about
[38:40] public investment in Bitcoin um and and
[38:44] voice those reservations from a
[38:47] conservative point of view. you know,
[38:48] these are fiscal conservatives who just
[38:51] say, you know, well, it's a bit too
[38:53] risky or, you know, I don't think it's
[38:54] appropriate or, you know, you know, kind
[38:57] of cautious fiscal conservative type
[39:00] thinking. Um, so why why am I talking
[39:03] about Utah? Because I think there's a
[39:05] good chance that there would be
[39:07] analogous, you know, similar Republican
[39:11] opposition at the federal level, too.
[39:13] Um, I just I say all of this to say that
[39:16] it's not a done deal that these that the
[39:18] Lonus bill gets through. Um, and in
[39:22] fact, I think will require a lot of
[39:24] advocacy and and a lot of probably
[39:27] um loud support from Bitcoiners.
[39:31] Is is it now the time for for Bitcoiners
[39:34] to kind of become more politically
[39:36] active for for for those things? Uh, I
[39:40] would I would say yes. Um, like it or
[39:43] not, Bitcoin has become
[39:47] a political constituency in the United
[39:51] States. Um, and this was this was
[39:55] achieved to I think to great success.
[39:57] Like bit Bitcoiners were instrumental in
[40:00] getting Donald Trump elected last year.
[40:04] Um, again, like it or not, I think that
[40:07] the the facts are the facts. um you kind
[40:09] of spearheaded in some part by folks
[40:11] like David Bailey um and many others who
[40:14] kind of did kind of laid laid the
[40:16] groundwork of Orange Quill and Donald
[40:17] Trump himself. Um but more broadly than
[40:20] that by
[40:23] by drawing together in reality donor
[40:27] support, right? That's how you become a
[40:29] meaningful political constituency is by
[40:31] becoming a don two things be becoming a
[40:33] a relevant donor class and then also
[40:36] demonstrating that there are you know a
[40:37] bunch of voters behind your movement too
[40:40] and who who are very passionate and very
[40:43] um un you know very committed to the
[40:46] cause. So, Bitcoin in 2024, Bitcoiners
[40:50] proved themselves to be just that
[40:53] powerful a powerful um kind of in
[40:56] alliance with digital assets more
[40:58] broadly, but a powerful donor class um
[41:01] and a very very loud, very passionate um
[41:05] kind of political advocacy group as
[41:08] well. This is Oh, sorry, my lights died.
[41:11] Um, so should Bitcoiners become more
[41:13] politically active? I think it's a
[41:16] little bit like asking
[41:19] should, you know,
[41:21] should hunters become more politically
[41:24] active or should truck drivers or
[41:27] should, you know, restaurant workers
[41:29] become more politically active? It's
[41:30] like well if you don't have an interest
[41:32] in politics as an individual
[41:34] no you know you don't don't have to but
[41:37] you are part of a political constituency
[41:40] and this is the way that democracy works
[41:43] is that you get listened to when you're
[41:45] a big enough group that can throw its
[41:47] weight around enough um and that's the
[41:50] territory that we're in with Bitcoin. So
[41:53] um there will be a political bitcoin
[41:55] movement for the foreseeable future. Um
[41:58] um and it will be there if you want to
[42:00] contribute to it. Yeah. And I think uh
[42:04] the opinion of some some Bitcoiners like
[42:06] oh like I have Bitcoin I don't need to
[42:08] care about politics. I think it's a
[42:10] little bit
[42:11] shortsighted. Um it's it's it's like
[42:15] maybe yeah maybe Bitcoin doesn't really
[42:18] care about politics because it's a
[42:21] global thing. uh and the game theory is
[42:23] working out and we're seeing an American
[42:25] now doing it and like uh yeah Europe can
[42:28] be against Bitcoin but they will come
[42:30] around in 5 10 years when they see the
[42:32] all the advantages that America has from
[42:34] it but you as a person are still in that
[42:36] jurisdiction and you can really benefit
[42:39] from let's say lower capital gains taxes
[42:43] you're being able to transact with it
[42:45] maybe under $1,000 taxree um you have
[42:49] the right to self custody all those
[42:50] things can be really benefit thing for
[42:52] you. Yeah, absolutely. You know, you you
[42:55] as a Bitcoiner might not care about
[42:56] politics, but politics certainly cares
[42:58] about you, right? Um kind of a spin on
[43:00] on an old saying. And you're right.
[43:03] There are lots of ways that you can
[43:05] benefit from good from from favorable
[43:07] political decisions as a Bitcoiner, but
[43:10] you can also be negatively affected,
[43:11] right? That's that's the other side of
[43:12] the coin.
[43:14] Um my view is if the prior
[43:17] administration in America was still in
[43:19] power and had won the last election, we
[43:21] would have seen a continuation of what
[43:22] was already happening, which is the
[43:25] arrest of open-source developers. the
[43:28] the
[43:31] um extrajudicial
[43:34] persecution and uh uh you know for
[43:36] political reasons more debankings
[43:40] um harsher regulations across the board.
[43:44] So these things matter. Um, and I
[43:49] think if you if you'll permit me to get
[43:51] on my my soap box for a second, I think
[43:54] there is a there is a certain strand of
[43:56] discourse in Bitcoin that wants nothing
[43:59] to do with this. And fair enough, like
[44:01] politics is ugly, you know, it's fair
[44:02] enough fair enough to want nothing to do
[44:04] with this. But um what I think is not
[44:07] fair is to say that engaging with
[44:10] politics at all as a Bitcoiner is
[44:12] somehow transgressive of the Bitcoin
[44:14] mission or the Bitcoin purpose or is
[44:17] somehow like antithetical or misaligned
[44:20] with with some
[44:22] alleged more pure way of like achieving
[44:25] kind of harmonious, you know, grounds up
[44:28] peer-to-peer vision for Bitcoin in the
[44:30] world. I think it's nonsense um for for
[44:32] just the reasons we described. Like
[44:34] there can be better or worse outcomes
[44:37] from real political decisions made in
[44:39] the near term and you can be either be
[44:41] on the side of the better or you can be
[44:44] on the side of the worse. Um that's what
[44:46] democracy is. So um I think it's you
[44:50] know politics and bitcoin coming
[44:52] together is inevitable. Um uh I think
[44:55] engaging with it is good and healthy and
[44:57] someone has to do it. So, um, and
[45:01] ultimately I
[45:03] think and and again to go back to where
[45:05] we started the conversation, I think
[45:06] it's a sign of Bitcoin's victory. Like
[45:09] that's what it's a sign of, right? Like
[45:12] when big powerful wealthy people are not
[45:15] paying attention to you at all, that
[45:18] means you are irrelevant. When powerful,
[45:21] wealthy people are paying a lot of
[45:23] attention to you, that means you are
[45:25] relevant. and they can either be paying
[45:27] attention to you in a positive way or a
[45:30] negative way. Um, what's happening is
[45:32] power the most powerful people in the
[45:34] world are paying a lot of very positive
[45:36] attention to Bitcoin right now. So,
[45:39] yeah, I like tell me where the problem
[45:42] is with that. Right. To me, it's it's
[45:44] not inconsistent with separating money
[45:45] from the state. In fact, it probably is
[45:47] a necessary part of that mission. And um
[45:51] and I'm yeah I I couldn't be more
[45:53] optimistic really about where things are
[45:55] going.
[45:58] How there are two two two questions in
[46:02] my mind. Um it's always when there's so
[46:04] much interesting stuff in this I cannot
[46:06] decide which direction to go but I think
[46:08] the first one is like wait are you are
[46:10] you surprised that we are so fast
[46:12] already in the political discussions
[46:14] with with with Bitcoin being still so
[46:18] early and still so so young in in in
[46:21] that development.
[46:24] Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely I am. I
[46:26] mean, I remember, you know, I I've said
[46:28] this a few times, but I it wasn't that
[46:30] long ago, 2021, 2022, when it seemed
[46:33] like the world was kind of clamping down
[46:35] on Bitcoin, on Bitcoin mining, you know,
[46:38] huge kind of environmental attacks um
[46:41] against against Bitcoin. Still serious
[46:44] questions about is the government going
[46:45] to try and regulate it out of existence.
[46:47] There were no ETFs. There was no
[46:49] discussion of ETFs at that point. uh
[46:51] very few serious political candidates
[46:53] taking up the mantle and running with
[46:55] it. So to go from that to this in a
[46:58] couple of years is is mind-blowing for
[47:01] sure. Um but I think it wouldn't have
[47:03] happened I really think it wouldn't have
[47:07] happened if not for the very unique
[47:10] circumstances probably of Trump himself.
[47:13] Um, and this I think will be, you know,
[47:16] when when the history of this is
[47:17] ultimately written, what I suspect will
[47:20] happen if it comes to light is we'll
[47:23] learn that Trump was really orange pill
[47:26] not just because like, oh, okay, there's
[47:29] a bunch of Bitcoiners and they can like
[47:30] donate to my campaign, but because he
[47:32] himself and his family were, this is
[47:36] true, they were
[47:37] debanked like they were debanked for for
[47:41] like political persecution. ution
[47:44] through through a program of political
[47:45] persecution. So, you know, what could
[47:47] orange pill you faster than um learning
[47:50] firsthand that you can be at a whim even
[47:53] if you are the former president of the
[47:55] United States just kicked out of the
[47:57] fiat banking system, right? So, so I'm
[48:01] not saying this is the reason, but what
[48:02] I think is there were like a unique set
[48:04] of circumstances that probably really
[48:07] accelerated political adoption of
[48:09] Bitcoin and you know in in and I guess
[48:13] maybe a more generalized way of saying
[48:15] that is it probably has been a reaction
[48:18] like there was there was an
[48:21] accelerated persecution of Bitcoin and
[48:24] digital assets and then as a reaction to
[48:26] that the pendulum swinging back in the
[48:28] other ction in on a number of fronts,
[48:30] Trump himself, but of course just across
[48:32] the the the landscape of legislators
[48:35] generally. Um it it really crystallized,
[48:39] I think, in many people's minds just how
[48:42] fragile financial sovereignty can be. So
[48:46] had it not been for the tidal waves of
[48:49] FUD and and persecution, maybe it would
[48:52] have been a slower process, right?
[48:55] That's very true. Uh I I I like that
[48:58] that idea of of like pinning that on a
[49:02] on a person uh that has gone through
[49:04] that thing of being depanked and that's
[49:07] that's I think something that with with
[49:10] Trump is a unique story also that he was
[49:13] like shot at right before the election
[49:16] come out a lot of very interesting
[49:20] highquality movies out of Bitcoin like 5
[49:23] 10 years down the road that are just
[49:26] amazing to see. And we have the honor
[49:29] now to actually live through the
[49:32] adoption of Bitcoin in real life and see
[49:34] that movie unfold. Uh and and people
[49:37] will just go crazy for that in in the
[49:39] future of like how amazing those
[49:42] adoption stories were. So I I think
[49:44] truly that Bitcoiners that are now
[49:46] active in Bitcoin are actively writing
[49:50] history. uh some are smaller part of the
[49:52] the book uh some of bigger part of the
[49:56] book but we all kind of write that that
[49:58] Bitcoin story and and we do matter and I
[50:01] think that's that's the main message uh
[50:03] that that I think is is important that
[50:05] uh that that the those voices is we are
[50:08] doing something really really unique uh
[50:10] here in writing history in a financial
[50:13] revolution yeah I couldn't agree more um
[50:16] and and it's not it's not only that
[50:18] there's so much great work being
[50:20] done from I guess within the ecosystem
[50:24] but it's also that the space has been
[50:26] completely abdicated by traditional
[50:30] institutions right what what we should
[50:33] have seen is like in-depth reporting the
[50:38] whole way through from the Wall Street
[50:40] Journal and from mainstream media
[50:42] organizations um across the board but we
[50:44] haven't seen that right there's been
[50:46] like a disinterest in hostility so you
[50:49] know in a way something to be grateful
[50:50] for because it's kind of cleared the
[50:51] path
[50:53] for honest reporters and honest seekers
[50:57] of truth to shape the narrative the
[51:00] whole way through. And you know at you
[51:02] know at the same time okay we just had
[51:04] this whole story about all this kind of
[51:05] unending unending FUD. So you know I
[51:09] guess how to reconcile that it's like on
[51:10] the one hand there's been this kind of
[51:12] disengagement disinterest and hostility
[51:14] which has you know provoked I think or
[51:20] or or helps to
[51:22] crystallize the the value proposition of
[51:25] Bitcoin itself somewhat ironically and
[51:28] also the the kind of lack of real
[51:32] rigorous attention being paid has has
[51:34] allowed this ecosystem to flourish. So,
[51:37] um, all of that is to say, you know, I
[51:40] guess we have to be grateful for the no
[51:42] coiners and we have to be grateful for
[51:44] the fudsters. Um, because, you know,
[51:47] what you don't want to have is
[51:49] intelligent, well-reasoned, well-funded,
[51:52] um, strong opposition. What you want to
[51:55] have is frivolous um you know
[51:59] half-interested poorly researched um you
[52:03] know unintelligent opposition and and
[52:05] Bitcoin has been fortunate to get a
[52:06] whole uh big dose of that over the
[52:09] recent years.
[52:10] Yeah. Because everyone that is honest uh
[52:13] and research Bitcoin deeply and is
[52:16] informed is switching to the Bitcoin
[52:18] side.
[52:19] Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I mean
[52:21] there's a, you know, there's it's like a
[52:24] it's a classic Bitcoin meme, right? It's
[52:26] like you've never met someone who spent
[52:28] 20 hours researching Bitcoin who's come
[52:30] out the other side of it like hating
[52:31] Bitcoin. Like such a person does not
[52:33] exist, right? Um the what the kind of
[52:36] the like some the slight caveat to that
[52:38] or I guess the mirror ex the mirror
[52:40] image to that to the negative side is
[52:42] that um there are many many people who
[52:45] did come into contact with Bitcoin early
[52:47] you know years ago and who because they
[52:50] dismissed it out of hand or didn't
[52:51] engage with it properly they've kind of
[52:54] painted themselves into this corner of
[52:56] like needing to be a lifelong enemy of
[52:58] Bitcoin in almost this this is my
[53:01] perception of in many many cases It's
[53:04] well, I have to keep pretending like
[53:06] Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme because if I
[53:08] ever admit that it's not, then I have to
[53:10] really um admit that I was responsible
[53:12] for for not getting involved 10 years
[53:14] ago and that would probably be too much
[53:16] to bear psychologically.
[53:19] Yeah, there's um I mean Peter Schiff
[53:21] always comes to my mind. He's I think
[53:23] the imperson
[53:25] inpersonification of of that uh Peter
[53:28] Schiff is a but I I think he orange
[53:30] built more people than uh than most
[53:32] Bitcoiners. There are there probably
[53:34] like 10 Bitcoiners that orange built
[53:36] more people than him. Yeah, I I got to
[53:39] say I'm a I'm a big fan of Peter Schiff.
[53:42] Um not necessarily his content. I'm not
[53:44] even sure if I follow him, but of course
[53:46] as a Bitcoiner you see plenty of it. But
[53:48] he's such a good poster. like he's he's
[53:51] I think like 90% of what he does is
[53:53] engagement bait and he's he's a master a
[53:56] master of the craft. Um there are a
[53:58] bunch of other like really salty no no
[54:00] coiners who you know like the odd you
[54:02] know New York Times journalists who will
[54:04] pop up like once every two years to to
[54:06] say something negative about Bitcoin and
[54:07] of course you look into their tweet
[54:09] history and they were dismissing it at
[54:11] $9. Those people are more the ones I'm
[54:13] talking about. Peter Schiff in some
[54:15] sense is kind of archetypal of that type
[54:17] of thinking. I just think he's he's a
[54:19] master entertainer um and and engagement
[54:22] baiter. Um so so I have to at least give
[54:25] him some respect for that.
[54:27] Absolutely. And uh there there's there's
[54:30] many more things I I wanted to get into
[54:33] with you today. But um I have one one
[54:36] question that I ask each and every one
[54:38] of my guest um um of of my podcast and
[54:42] the question is what can we learn from
[54:44] you besides Bitcoin? Um, so I think
[54:47] that's God that's a good question. What
[54:50] can you learn from me besides Bitcoin?
[54:51] Well, so one tangible thing, um, I want
[54:55] to give a quick plug to, you know, so
[54:58] this this website that I built, Bitcoin
[55:01] laws, I have built
[55:03] it almost 100% with the help of AI
[55:07] tools. Um, and I have like coded this
[55:11] thing. I I don't know how to code. I'm
[55:12] not an engineer, but I've coded this
[55:14] thing almost entirely with the the help
[55:17] of AI.
[55:19] Um, anybody that's on Twitter probably
[55:21] sees that this is kind of trendy at the
[55:22] moment. People kind of trying out, you
[55:24] know, building things, you know, vibe
[55:26] coding and whatever. Um, if I had like
[55:28] one piece of advice to offer, if I would
[55:31] say if anybody's curious in it, like go
[55:32] and try it and do it because it's
[55:33] amazing what you can do. And Bitcoin
[55:36] laws is an example of something
[55:38] completely written with with uh Claude.
[55:41] Um maybe in a more personal sense or
[55:44] more general sense, I think um like part
[55:47] of the reason why I think I've been able
[55:49] to add some value, at least let's say
[55:51] with Bitcoin laws, is just wanting to go
[55:54] one layer deeper than what I what you
[55:57] see on social media. there is so much
[56:00] noise and um
[56:04] frankly you know I hate the term
[56:06] misinformation but it is misinformation
[56:08] like the way that people reporting
[56:09] particularly on a lot of these um
[56:11] legislative processes um and so what I
[56:16] would encourage people to do is like try
[56:19] and look past the engagement bait and
[56:21] like go and like read primary sources um
[56:25] I would like I would say this to any
[56:26] Bitcoiner or non- Bitcoin or anybody
[56:28] it's likere inreasingly important to
[56:29] like go and try and read the primary
[56:31] sources. And I think with Bitcoin laws,
[56:32] that's something that I've that's like
[56:34] part of the mission is like to make it
[56:36] easy and accessible for people to do
[56:37] that, to actually go and um go to the
[56:40] the the actual source of data.
[56:43] Um like I'm incredibly glad that you
[56:47] know Elon Musk bought Twitter and and
[56:49] and kind of in some sense fixed it, but
[56:52] in other senses I think he kind of broke
[56:53] it. And I think, you know, the the the
[56:55] real the critics of it who say that it
[56:57] is just like a noise machine right now.
[56:58] I think that there there's a strong
[57:00] element of truth there. Um and you know,
[57:04] I'm not like I'm not tilted by it on a
[57:06] daily basis cuz I understand that it is
[57:08] what it is, but there is so much noise
[57:10] out there. So like go and find primary
[57:13] sources when you can if it's anything
[57:14] related to Bitcoin in particular. Um and
[57:18] uh that would be I guess a parting piece
[57:20] of advice I would give to. Absolutely.
[57:23] Yeah, the the going the primary sources
[57:27] is extremely valuable. I I always look
[57:33] at mainstream media also uh just because
[57:35] it's uh it's it's fun to see. Uh and in
[57:38] Austria, they reported on JD Vance being
[57:41] in Munich. Uh and I was like, "Wow, like
[57:44] that that that has to be such a bad
[57:47] performance he gave." and like he he
[57:49] said so many bad things about Europe and
[57:51] the UK and Germany and I was like okay
[57:54] let's let's see the speech and I was
[57:56] just like oh let's it's a 10 15 minute
[57:59] speech it's not that long like it's it's
[58:00] easy to look at um I was just like
[58:03] cooking something and putting the the
[58:05] speech on uh at the side and I was like
[58:09] that's just reasonable things like like
[58:11] 15 minutes uncontroversial hey uh it's
[58:15] important that we have we can say what
[58:17] we want to Uh I think the only attack on
[58:21] uh Europe was an attack on on the UK. So
[58:24] not not even on Europe. Uh where he
[58:26] where he said a fact that people are
[58:28] getting um imprisoned because of tweets
[58:32] and this was a fact. It was not it
[58:35] actually happened. So like repeating
[58:38] facts should not be an attack even
[58:40] though it can be one. And I was like,
[58:42] yeah,
[58:43] that they they have their they have a
[58:46] news story and put their own perception
[58:48] of that on top. Um I I don't want to get
[58:51] into if there's an agenda or not, but
[58:53] they they definitely put the as an
[58:55] subjective thing on there. And it's just
[58:57] way better to instead of uh seeing what
[59:00] all the people say about it, just look
[59:03] it up yourself and then see the 50-minut
[59:05] speech. It's it's so great. Yep.
[59:08] Couldn't agree more. Absolutely. Um, one
[59:10] more thing because you brought up AI.
[59:13] Um, what if at all uh do you think is
[59:16] the impact of AI on Bitcoin? So, one
[59:20] area that I'm that I'm not at all an
[59:22] expert on, but I am but very smart
[59:24] people that I know are paying attention
[59:26] to are potential applications for
[59:28] Bitcoin as as payment systems between AI
[59:34] agents. Um and so the idea here being
[59:38] you know an increasing share of activity
[59:41] on the internet is going to be done by
[59:43] conducted by AI agents. Um they are
[59:46] going to become you know increasingly
[59:49] like economic actors who need to go out
[59:50] and and do things and buy goods and
[59:52] services. Um and in order to do that
[59:55] they're going to have to pay for them.
[59:58] Um and so there are there are some
[60:00] really smart people whether it's at
[60:01] Lightning Labs developing a particular
[60:03] protocol for this. I think L L402 maybe
[60:06] or just others too. Um there's kind of a
[60:09] a burgeoning set of of founders and
[60:12] investors who are like looking at this
[60:14] as like Bitcoin basically being and and
[60:16] lightning potentially being kind of um
[60:19] payment rails for AI agents. So that's
[60:22] that's one way. One other way which um
[60:26] maybe is a bit more macro is I don't
[60:29] know I don't know how convicted I am in
[60:31] this view but I think there's there's a
[60:34] there's a decent argument to be made
[60:38] that transformative AI
[60:43] is transformative AI mel may well
[60:46] precipitate massive deflationary effects
[60:49] in the across the global economy.
[60:53] um goods and services becoming radically
[60:58] exponentially
[60:59] cheaper and in an obvious way an obvious
[61:02] way would be as increasingly jobs become
[61:05] done by robots right at much lower cost
[61:08] and so
[61:11] um I think to some degree that is is has
[61:14] already started to happen and I think it
[61:15] probably is inevitable and so then you
[61:18] have to ask yourself what happens next
[61:20] and I think any any any Bitcoiner really
[61:24] has to consider this consider this
[61:26] seriously. What I suspect will happen
[61:28] next
[61:30] is the that governments will try to
[61:34] counteract these deflationary effects
[61:37] which another word for saying massive
[61:39] deflation is like economic contraction
[61:42] um you know serious recessions. So
[61:45] what's going to happen in response? And
[61:47] it is going to be an attempt to
[61:48] reinflate or keep inflated the the the
[61:52] economy by printing money. Um not just
[61:56] to save off like global global
[61:58] recessions, but to keep like core
[62:03] welfare state programs afloat and keep
[62:05] them in place, right? like how how are
[62:07] you going to keep your welfare states
[62:09] alive if tax bases collapse because
[62:12] people lose their jobs because they're
[62:13] being done by robots and all these
[62:14] things. I mean, this gets a little bit
[62:16] like science fictiony. Um, but I think
[62:18] to some degree these trends are already
[62:20] underway and what I think it does is
[62:23] basically just accelerate the debasement
[62:26] of fiat currencies. Interesting. I and I
[62:30] think it in indefinitely enhances the
[62:34] adoption of I think it might be a
[62:37] controversial stance but if you talk
[62:39] like 15 minutes a day with an AI you
[62:43] probably get smarter with that like you
[62:45] get information and and they're really
[62:47] good in in giving you information and
[62:48] and talking you through stuff. Uh it's
[62:51] kind of amazing. uh and and just like
[62:54] that enhanced also with Bitcoin and and
[62:57] and getting to to decisions also around
[63:00] the financial topic. I think people will
[63:02] get smarter around things and and look
[63:05] through things more quickly. Uh and in
[63:08] that way I think bit AI is kind of like
[63:11] enhancing Bitcoin adoption as you said
[63:13] like also the uh enhancing the the
[63:16] downfall of fiat basically. Really good.
[63:18] Yeah, I I like that framing. Um, as you
[63:21] know, we have an end routine in the
[63:22] podcast where the previous guest is
[63:24] asking a question for the next guest
[63:25] without knowing who the next guest
[63:26] actually is. And your question from the
[63:28] previous guest is uh an interesting one.
[63:31] How do you overcome the emotional roller
[63:33] coaster coaster that comes with having
[63:36] and buying Bitcoin? Or do you see that?
[63:39] I I I think I think time time like um I
[63:43] think I I'm I'm fortunate enough to be
[63:45] at a point now where I I I have emot I
[63:49] have overcome that emotional side of
[63:52] things. I' you know I I've lost count of
[63:54] the number of 20% 30% draw downs and of
[63:57] course the the bare market ones too. Um
[64:00] so for the most part I think it's just
[64:02] experience and time and repetition like
[64:05] anything else. It's almost like a skill
[64:07] that you acquire expertise in through
[64:10] repetition.
[64:11] Um, of course, it helps to have a really
[64:14] strong conviction in Bitcoin. And I
[64:15] think if you don't have that, then it's
[64:17] going to be hard to ever to ever develop
[64:19] that resilience. Um, but I think yeah,
[64:23] going through it again and again and
[64:25] again and again, that that would be the
[64:27] main
[64:29] prescription I would say. do it again
[64:31] and huddle and do it again and huddle
[64:33] and eventually you'll just become more
[64:36] more numb to it. Yeah. And I think the
[64:39] as you said the the conviction and the
[64:42] uh knowing why Bitcoin is is kind of the
[64:44] fundamental uh uh thing to that. Um
[64:47] sorry I'm just I've got two little
[64:49] orange kitties that areing at me. So
[64:51] yeah, they're so sweet.
[64:56] I love them. Really cool. Uh then then
[64:58] we also know uh if you are a dog or cat
[65:01] person now. Yeah, that's the answer. Cat
[65:04] person. Definitely. Are those the only
[65:07] ones? No, I've got a we've got two other
[65:10] cats actually. Um uh third one orange.
[65:14] So I guess you can see there's a bit of
[65:15] an orange theme in the household. Uh I
[65:18] love that. Yeah. Um yeah, really cool.
[65:21] Uh thank you so much Julian for for
[65:23] being on a second time on my podcast. Um
[65:26] before I let you go, where can people
[65:27] find you? ask you questions and reach
[65:28] out to you. Yeah. Uh X is X is the best
[65:33] place. Um my handle I think yeah
[65:36] Julianouble Farra. Um but uh my DMs are
[65:40] open I think. So um probably the best
[65:42] way to get in touch. Um uh also I guess
[65:45] I'm running a second account um called
[65:47] Bitcoin Laws. So if you have any
[65:48] questions specifically about the the
[65:49] Bitcoin laws stuff, you can you can hit
[65:51] me up there. Really cool. Thank you so
[65:54] much for for being on the show. Also,
[65:55] thank you so much for everyone in this
[65:57] watching and listening for joining us
[65:58] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
