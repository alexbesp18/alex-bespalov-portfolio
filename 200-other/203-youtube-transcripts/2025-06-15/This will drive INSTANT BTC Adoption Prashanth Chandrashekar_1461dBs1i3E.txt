[00:00] it being used as a payments one person
[00:02] paying and converting Bitcoin to
[00:03] tangible value in the real life is a
[00:05] real way for it to be adopted once we
[00:07] hit 100K that could trigger something
[00:11] really magical we SE to exist we can't
[00:14] operate as a business anymore it's too
[00:15] risky for us to build anything in India
[00:17] what do you think will be the biggest
[00:19] Drive of Bitcoin adoption once you have
[00:21] Bitcoin your wallet you're closest
[00:22] towards freedom and sovereign individual
[00:24] you can move to any country and spend it
[00:26] there and no one can take this away from
[00:27] you it reflects in every aspect of life
[00:30] can you do it in a way that maybe even
[00:31] nobody notice it and the only way is
[00:34] [Music]
[00:37] bitc hi pruss uh how you doing
[00:40] everything

[01:27] something like that 1 1:30 so might
[01:30] actually come when when you have the
[01:31] presentation I will I will definitely
[01:32] watch that and check you out will will
[01:35] be interesting to see before we get into
[01:37] all the Bitcoin things all the the other
[01:40] things uh as as I don't know you and
[01:42] probably some of our listeners don't
[01:44] know you uh who are you and and and why
[01:46] are you why are you so passionate about
[01:49] Bitcoin that you even work in
[01:51] Bitcoin yeah sure so uh I'm from I'm a
[01:57] engineer firstly so I I'm to much
[02:00] interested in building products so uh
[02:02] like especially Building Product that
[02:04] adds value so my college days I was more
[02:08] interested in like building products and
[02:10] then shipping it out so it gives me a
[02:12] lot of joy and then eventually I
[02:13] stumbled upon Bitcoin and then after
[02:16] reading the book mastering
[02:19] Bitcoin um it was it was amazing how
[02:21] Bitcoin worked and uh I couldn't stop
[02:25] thinking about it and I was looking for
[02:27] all like working in Bitcoin companies
[02:28] Bitcoin startups
[02:30] I know at the time like in it was 2019
[02:32] it was hard to find Bitcoin
[02:33] companies but I was lucky to find one it
[02:36] was called last bit and then uh the
[02:38] founder was bangalorian Bangalore is a
[02:40] place in India so it's a a capital city
[02:42] of a state in South India so I started
[02:45] working there as an engineer and that's
[02:47] how my Bitcoin Journey started so I
[02:50] basically born and brought up in India
[02:53] so I moved to Estonia briefly like in
[02:55] 2021 November I moved to Estonia I
[02:58] stayed there for about a year I moved
[03:00] back uh to India to start bringing and I
[03:02] came back right now I'm in Lithuania
[03:04] wait so you started bringing in India
[03:08] yeah so uh it's a funny story so if uh
[03:11] like like I had to leave Estonia because
[03:14] I had a Visa that was attached to my
[03:16] employment in Estonia a company in
[03:18] Estonia so I had to choose either being
[03:22] employed in the company and continue
[03:24] having the life here or give it up and
[03:26] move to India to start bring in so I
[03:29] also tried applying uh for startup Visa
[03:31] like you know I made it prototype and
[03:33] then I submitted but then they wanted
[03:35] MVP Estonia startup committee but to
[03:38] build an MVP which works with real money
[03:40] it takes many years in fintech right so
[03:42] uh had no choice but to uh go back to
[03:45] India and yeah that that's when I
[03:47] started working on bring in oh okay yeah
[03:51] I I see that the same thing a little bit
[03:53] with my girlfriend that we talked a lot
[03:54] about before because I have an Indian
[03:55] girlfriend she's since two years here
[03:58] and she also has to work with companies
[03:59] and and stuff like that so she can stay
[04:01] here in Austria I I'm a lot of in
[04:04] contact with her also with the with the
[04:06] agencies I know I know I know the
[04:09] struggles you might have gone through
[04:12] but I love that you you came back and
[04:14] and that you did the bringing company uh
[04:17] and yeah how's it how's it been uh but
[04:20] maybe let's first start with um what
[04:23] what is springing doing and what is
[04:25] springing trying to to do in in the
[04:28] market and how is it different to to to
[04:30] different
[04:31] companies yeah sure uh so like the
[04:33] reason why bringing existed or why it
[04:35] exists is because I personally fa a
[04:38] problem when I was in Estonia so I used
[04:40] to receive a part of my payment in
[04:42] Bitcoin I us to receive it directly into
[04:44] my Hardware wallet so at the time I used
[04:47] binance to liquidate bitcoin to get
[04:49] euros into my bank account revolute it
[04:51] took more it took four days to get euros
[04:53] into my account and it was not only time
[04:55] consuming but also it was not safe I
[04:58] used to get notification from revolute
[05:01] asking about Sour of funds and of course
[05:03] binance user experience is terrible I
[05:06] had to pay fees in every single step and
[05:09] Kraken at the time did not have sepa
[05:11] withdrawals and I was surprised to see
[05:13] there were no like you know tools to
[05:14] liquidate bitcoin and get euros into my
[05:16] bank account at the time I really wanted
[05:19] uh to liquidate bitcoin uh I wanted
[05:21] Euros very badly so I was so shocked and
[05:25] then I having been worked in Bitcoin
[05:27] fintech industry from almost 4 years
[05:29] like in the same space so I wanted to
[05:31] solve this myself so that's why I
[05:33] started bringing primarily to solve this
[05:35] problem uh to make liquidation of
[05:38] Bitcoin reliable instant and safe in a
[05:43] stupidly easy user experience so uh that
[05:47] is what it is today so our
[05:50] MVP allows users to liquidate bitcoin
[05:52] from any wallet lighning or on chain get
[05:55] Euros to any bank account and uh it's
[05:58] completely reliable we moved around 9
[06:00] Bitcoin so far with
[06:02] MVP and uh no questions asked from the
[06:04] bank regarding the transfer we supportan
[06:07] transfer so it gets instantly into the
[06:09] bank account and feels like magic so
[06:11] that's what bringing us today but uh we
[06:15] are more like an interface that can
[06:16] connect any bank account and any wallet
[06:18] so we are going a step ahead integrating
[06:21] wallets directly like ALB nosu wet
[06:25] connect and Breeze uh like the green
[06:28] light node running and and you can
[06:30] connect to the node using Bree SDK so
[06:32] we're going Step
[06:34] Ahead allowing this Ian accounts to
[06:37] interact with other wallets that users
[06:38] already use so that the interaction
[06:41] between euro and Bitcoin is
[06:43] seamless and with the user experience
[06:45] that has not been seen before like you
[06:47] know Monon and everything has a widgets
[06:49] but this is a different ux that we want
[06:50] to get into us for the
[06:52] users how different because usually um
[06:55] you have like just an exchange in
[06:56] between you have like uh some relay
[06:59] bance 21 Bitcoin like all those those
[07:01] exchanges between like your bank account
[07:04] and your Hardware wallet or your softare
[07:06] wall whatever um how different is uh is
[07:09] bringing now like how is the the user
[07:13] experience
[07:14] different yeah so uh most of the apps
[07:17] that you just mentioned are Brokers
[07:19] which who allow users to liquidate and
[07:21] buy Bitcoin but bringing is provides a
[07:24] dedicated iban accounts to every users
[07:26] so uh like we are more like a new bank
[07:29] with dedicated iban account and debit
[07:32] cards so it's as good as any new Banks
[07:36] like revolute and wise but that has more
[07:40] interaction with Bitcoin like xub
[07:43] integration and then NWC integration Ln
[07:46] addresses Ln URL and more into Bitcoin
[07:50] so it's like you can imagine it to be
[07:52] like a revolute but built for Bitcoin
[07:54] for
[07:55] bitcoiners for seamless uh interop
[07:58] between euros and Bitcoin so you offer a
[08:03] actual bank account with like the bank
[08:05] license and everything uh and then uh
[08:08] you have an integration so it's it's
[08:11] more like you have an end the six or
[08:13] revolute bank but it's directly
[08:16] integrated with a Bitcoin wallet and
[08:19] less like a broker yes that's correct oh
[08:22] nice so so you also got a banking
[08:25] license and all that stuff that comes
[08:27] comes with that it's a lot of right yeah
[08:31] so currently we don't hold licenses
[08:32] ourselves so we plug into multiple
[08:35] Financial Services we stitch them
[08:37] together in this infrastructure and put
[08:39] Bitcoin connect that to bitcoin and
[08:42] lightening in a way that uh it's given
[08:45] as a beautiful user experience for the
[08:46] user user will not have to uh know about
[08:49] anything So eventually we will get our
[08:51] own licenses right now we are using
[08:53] other Financial Services to do so so we
[08:55] don't hold funds we don't touch funds at
[08:57] the moment So eventually we will acquire
[08:59] own
[09:00] licenses and uh we'll do it
[09:02] ourselves it's a it's an interesting
[09:05] idea having uh the bank account directly
[09:08] Li uh in there and it also brings the
[09:12] the traditional Financial system a
[09:14] little bit closer to to bitco did you
[09:17] did you had any struggle till now with
[09:19] with the founding and and integrating
[09:21] Bitcoin even closer to the addal
[09:23] financial system any challenges
[09:26] regulator hurdles or something like that
[09:29] yeah for sure so uh the main thing is
[09:32] like traditional institutes don't like
[09:33] to work with exchanges right so because
[09:36] cryptocurrencies or any virtual assets
[09:38] are considered to be natively risky so
[09:41] for Bank like like iban accounts provide
[09:44] to the users so the if those Financial
[09:46] Services have to work with Bitcoin that
[09:50] means the compliance in house has to be
[09:53] such a way that it checks all the boxes
[09:56] for the compliance but provide a user
[09:59] EXP for bitcoiners
[10:01] while the financial services who
[10:03] provides who helps us providing iban
[10:05] account sees that it's safe you know
[10:08] it's it's it's kind of hard to strike
[10:11] that balance with good user experience
[10:13] not holding the Bitcoin custody but
[10:15] giving Ian accounts so it took a while
[10:17] to do this together like uh pick the
[10:19] right financial services and talk to
[10:21] multiple people and get this done but uh
[10:24] yeah uh we also did this in last pit
[10:28] like my previous company we did the same
[10:30] thing but then we couldn't
[10:32] scale uh multiple ky's multiple partners
[10:35] so we went ahead and got our own
[10:37] licenses last bit renamed to
[10:40] striga Incorporated in Estonia got a
[10:43] wasp license in Estonia so now bring in
[10:47] users ster services to
[10:50] give uh this applications to users so
[10:53] bring in is like a technology company
[10:55] built on sta Financial Services which at
[10:57] time try to do the same what is doing
[11:01] today I love it a lot and then when you
[11:04] have an Ian account with bring in you
[11:09] basically also can just get your salary
[11:12] right there
[11:13] right yeah so it's it's not a fully
[11:15] fleshed bank account yet so it's just an
[11:17] airband account which means you can
[11:19] deposit and withdraw funds so third
[11:21] party payment providers are not
[11:22] supported yet eventually we will uh we
[11:25] will allow you to send funds to any iban
[11:28] number
[11:29] or receive Euros from any iban number
[11:32] for now you can like deposit from your
[11:34] own iban account and R you to your own
[11:35] iban account with a p and transfer so
[11:38] right now it's receive
[11:41] only you can send and receive from your
[11:43] own iban account like if you have any
[11:45] other personal bank account in your name
[11:48] from there you can send and receive
[11:49] funds to bring an iban account and
[11:51] really nice I love that so many
[11:54] bitcoiners and so many people in the
[11:56] Bitcoin ecosystem uh try to fix figure
[11:59] out how to make the overall user
[12:02] experience for Bitcoin better I mean
[12:05] that's that's kind of the goal like yeah
[12:08] a lot of people like think that adoption
[12:12] like the priz will bring in the most
[12:13] people but I think actually uh the price
[12:17] com combined with um the technology and
[12:22] infrastructure will bring in the most
[12:24] people because when we have great banks
[12:26] that integrate Bitcoin directly uh when
[12:29] we have all the infrastructure uh uh on
[12:32] top of Bitcoin with lightning with layer
[12:34] three four and stuff like that and and I
[12:36] want to come back to that later a little
[12:38] bit um then then people will not even
[12:41] notice that they use Bitcoin um but they
[12:44] will use Bitcoin anyways because it's
[12:47] just the best base layer of our
[12:49] financial
[12:50] system yeah for sure so uh like like to
[12:54] be honest like people are used to new
[12:57] Banks right they're comfortable using
[12:58] new Banks and bank accounts so for them
[13:02] to complete a transition to bitcoin of
[13:04] course it's it's it's happening like
[13:06] there lot of people using self- custody
[13:07] wallet and it Bitcoin has to be self-
[13:09] custody but this transition has to be
[13:13] posted by this user experience that
[13:16] feels like a bank account like like the
[13:18] way they're used to the behaviors
[13:20] they're used to sending funds and
[13:21] receiving funds depositing and withd
[13:23] drawing the user experience has to be
[13:25] something that they're used to and but
[13:28] still it has to harder to the core
[13:30] principles of Bitcoin self custody
[13:32] because once Bitcoin is given custody
[13:35] it's not Bitcoin anymore I mean the
[13:36] whole point if Bitcoin
[13:40] um existence of Bitcoin like is defeated
[13:43] right like if you give the custody of
[13:44] course like there are uh like companies
[13:47] allows users to buy Bitcoin hold in the
[13:49] custody and then they can withdraw any
[13:51] time uh that's for buy Bitcoin but
[13:53] eventually we need to uh evolve into the
[13:56] systems where uh we don't hold the Cass
[13:58] but educate people to get into their
[14:00] self
[14:00] custody but the main factor is trust you
[14:03] know like uh like if they receive
[14:06] notifications from bank account about
[14:09] receiving funds from exchanges that
[14:11] scares them and like most of the people
[14:14] I meate like my girlfriend who she was
[14:16] not into Bitcoin and she says uh is
[14:19] isn't it Bitcoin scam or something like
[14:20] that people are in that notion right
[14:23] from there if you want to get them to
[14:25] actually use it it has to be as reliable
[14:27] as banking as convenient as
[14:30] thinking yeah it's it's definitely true
[14:32] and what what do you think is the the
[14:35] biggest will be the biggest Drive of
[14:37] Bitcoin adoption is it is it the ux is
[14:39] this is it the price what do what do you
[14:42] see as the the biggest uh adoption Drive
[14:45] in the coming future it's ux and price
[14:47] both uh so because like till to date has
[14:50] been Price Right like Bitcoin has used
[14:53] is is treated as an asset which will if
[14:55] you hold in future you will have
[14:58] Financial gains
[15:00] because of its anti-inflationary
[15:02] properties right it it has no inflation
[15:04] so which is a good reason to hold
[15:07] Bitcoin uh and people are buying Bitcoin
[15:09] because the prices go up price is
[15:11] definitely an important factor for
[15:13] adoption but user experience like it
[15:16] should not be a barrier so even user
[15:20] experience might not lead to the
[15:21] adoption but it can be a barrier for
[15:23] adoption if it's not done right so with
[15:26] a good user
[15:27] experience option will not be uh it
[15:30] should not be better for the adoption so
[15:32] user experience and price both are
[15:33] important for adoption and uh apart from
[15:37] that like Bitcoin uses payments like you
[15:39] know like shops accepting Bitcoin and
[15:42] then people paying bit paying with
[15:43] Bitcoin so uh that's why we wanted to
[15:47] create focus on off ramping because no
[15:48] one wants to focus on off ramping
[15:49] because it's not lucrative right people
[15:51] want to help people buy Bitcoin and then
[15:54] hold it in their custody or any
[15:55] exchanges they want to help people buy
[15:57] Bitcoin so uh when people can't spend it
[16:01] it becomes harder for them to hold
[16:02] Bitcoin so they should be able to spend
[16:04] it instantly and Merchant should be able
[16:05] to accept Bitcoin instantly convert to
[16:07] Euro uh so that they can escape from the
[16:10] volatility risk but still accepting
[16:11] Bitcoin right so Bitcoin using as a
[16:14] payments will drive adoption but we're
[16:16] far from there a lot less Merchants
[16:19] actually accept Euro uh Bitcoin but due
[16:22] to its Advantage like low instant
[16:23] settlements and low fees can drive some
[16:26] adoption in payments and that will
[16:28] really Drive option like a person paying
[16:30] with Bitcoin and Merchant receiving and
[16:33] the label Bitcoin accepted year and one
[16:35] person doing the transaction so this
[16:37] will D option yeah absolutely and and
[16:40] the laugh that um when when more people
[16:44] come in Bitcoin there will be more
[16:46] people working in Bitcoin and when more
[16:48] people work in Bitcoin they will uh make
[16:51] more interesting stuff and more
[16:53] beautiful stuff and more uh great
[16:55] infrastructure stuff uh and then more
[16:58] people in because of that it's like it's
[17:00] it's a self
[17:02] reinforcing ecosystem that just gets
[17:05] strong with every person that comes in
[17:07] and with every company that comes in
[17:08] every thing that comes in yeah um that's
[17:12] why it's really interesting for me to
[17:13] always cover how people came into
[17:16] Bitcoin and why they they came into
[17:18] Bitcoin and how how was your story how
[17:20] did you came in Bitcoin why did you
[17:22] first get started with with the whole
[17:24] thing yeah sure so like first I heard
[17:27] about Bitcoin 2017 the price uh like you
[17:30] know like it went up so there was one of
[17:33] my friend who was like talking about
[17:35] Bitcoin DN he was saying like Bitcoin is
[17:37] like digital gold and it's decentralized
[17:39] you can send over Banks and everything I
[17:40] didn't quite pay much attention although
[17:42] it was always in my back of back of my
[17:44] mind so once I started studying
[17:47] mastering Bitcoin because it got me
[17:48] curious so and then so the technology
[17:52] itself was it it looked promising it's
[17:55] like it got me thinking a lot of days
[17:56] and it's like you can send funds without
[17:58] any banks in involved and the technology
[18:00] itself was super fascinating it's it's
[18:02] it's it's more it strikes your intuition
[18:04] it's like how is this possible like you
[18:06] know like it
[18:08] was uh I was mind blown and uh and after
[18:12] talking to a few people in the industry
[18:14] and I understand yeah it is actually
[18:15] mind-blowing and uh so I kind of
[18:18] understood that it's going to be used as
[18:21] payments and like and it's going to be
[18:23] the world's money like you know the
[18:25] modern money and I'm going to start
[18:27] working
[18:29] in Bitcoin space building things in
[18:31] Bitcoin for its adoption I love it a lot
[18:34] and you also integrate uh lightning uh
[18:37] like you have lightning and Bitcoin how
[18:39] do you see the future of scaling Bitcoin
[18:41] is is is lightting uh now the solution
[18:45] or what do you imagine uh if we can
[18:48] because now now we have like a few
[18:50] people that are on bitcoin and not a lot
[18:52] of people use Bitcoin as payment methods
[18:55] so there will be a lot more people come
[18:57] on the on the on the Bitcoin main chain
[18:59] on on the Bitcoin second layers also how
[19:02] do you envision like the future for
[19:04] scaling Bitcoin and how do you see that
[19:06] part yeah
[19:08] so Bitcoin is a amazing payments Network
[19:12] inant settlement even like if you see
[19:14] like moving funds on chain 15 minutes
[19:17] moving huge amount of funds like the
[19:19] number doesn't matter between two points
[19:21] of the world is great
[19:23] already but of course like micro
[19:25] payments small payments could get
[19:26] expensive lightning so again like
[19:29] scaling Bitcoin or bit scaling Bitcoin
[19:32] or Bitcoin adoption uh it being used as
[19:34] a payments like one person paying and
[19:37] converting Bitcoin to tangible value in
[19:39] the real life is a real way for it it to
[19:42] be adopted like like everyone getting on
[19:44] board on bitcoin that Network effect has
[19:46] to be there and lightning is super
[19:48] important plays a super important role
[19:51] there smaller payments and send
[19:53] settlements and send payments so
[19:55] lightning plays a super important role
[19:57] more and more lightning gets adopted
[20:00] more and more Bitcoin gets adopted as a
[20:02] payments and that will lead to more
[20:04] exponential growth not linear so right
[20:07] now people are buying for its price and
[20:10] it's a great store of value but when
[20:12] it's bought when it's used as payments
[20:14] it increase efficiency of present
[20:16] Payment Systems that's when that option
[20:18] will
[20:19] increase it will be also interesting
[20:21] when people like actually use it as a
[20:23] medum of exchange and then more more
[20:25] merchants accept it uh and then then you
[20:29] have it at all the merchants all the the
[20:31] Bitcoin symbols there and people are
[20:33] like what's that Bitcoin thing this this
[20:36] will really drive I think it could
[20:38] really Drive adoption in in a major way
[20:42] yeah for sure there should be a value
[20:44] like if if a merchant is happy to
[20:46] receive with cards card payments and if
[20:49] there's no value that Bitcoin adds you
[20:51] wouldn't start using Bitcoin for its you
[20:53] know ideological purposes so he's doing
[20:56] a business right a merant he Ori is
[20:57] doing a business so so they need a value
[21:00] out of Bitcoin so that's when like you
[21:02] know like uh the instant settlements and
[21:05] uh cheaper payments uh can really add
[21:08] value in payments and Bitcoin can be
[21:11] accepted more and paid with Bitcoin more
[21:13] um what what do you think will be the
[21:16] the cultural impact of of Bitcoin I
[21:19] think Bitcoin can really make a huge
[21:22] difference in in the world uh not even
[21:26] for like Financial inclusion for all
[21:28] that obvious stuff but what what what
[21:31] can make like if we have like a sound
[21:33] money basis do you do you feel like
[21:36] there's a huge uh impact that Bitcoin
[21:39] can have on on on culture yeah for sure
[21:43] so like I'm from India right like it's a
[21:46] developing country the inflation is much
[21:48] more than countries like United States
[21:51] and Europe and any countries in
[21:53] Europe so I have a lot of cousins and
[21:56] family was in Middle Class right like
[21:59] they like struggle for like they work
[22:01] every day to get enough to manage their
[22:04] houses and uh living in a city ID jobs
[22:07] and all that so the inflation
[22:10] is so hidden in the system they're not
[22:14] realizing that their value like their
[22:17] time and energy put is not converted to
[22:19] the value that they can save it's taken
[22:23] away from them without they being aware
[22:25] of it so and it's it's reflecting in
[22:29] their day-to-day lives so they're
[22:32] looking for salary hikes and that's not
[22:34] enough and that's creating them pressure
[22:37] to change the jobs so every day
[22:39] everyday's life is CH is is harder and I
[22:41] can see the reason right so I can only
[22:44] imagine if Bitcoin is a store of value
[22:47] if they get paid in Bitcoin or like if
[22:50] they can store the Savings in Bitcoin
[22:52] that's how they can have a better life
[22:54] right like it's it's just my close ones
[22:56] like my cousins and my friends so uh it
[23:00] can really add huge value in developing
[23:03] countries where inflation is more
[23:06] Bitcoin can definitely add value and uh
[23:09] and and Bitcoin is also also gives
[23:12] Freedom right like for example if I have
[23:13] to move away from India and uh like move
[23:15] funds to India there's a lot of
[23:17] complaints around moving funds where is
[23:19] a source of funds and everything so I
[23:20] can't like you know take a million
[23:21] dollar from India and just move to
[23:22] another country with convert Euros so
[23:25] when I have to convert there's like tons
[23:26] of barriers and everything so this
[23:29] restricts the freedom so uh restricts
[23:32] people moving from one country to
[23:33] another country it creates a nation it
[23:35] creates boundaries it creates conflicts
[23:37] everything is because it's controlled by
[23:40] money so once you have Bitcoin your
[23:42] wallet
[23:43] your you're more closer towards freedom
[23:46] and sovereign individual you can move to
[23:48] any country and spend it there and no
[23:51] one can take this away from you and it's
[23:53] super it it reflects in every aspect of
[23:56] life people will get get better
[23:58] healthare better education better
[24:00] Freedom it it reflects in every possible
[24:02] aspects of life if you are listening to
[24:04] this podcast you might be wondering what
[24:06] is actually the setup look like of Robin
[24:09] or how can I improve my Bitcoin setup
[24:11] and there's two things you have to buy
[24:13] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[24:15] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[24:17] let's focus on the first thing how to
[24:19] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[24:21] only exchange don't deal with the
[24:23] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[24:25] exchange that has an own token or
[24:27] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[24:29] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[24:33] for me the best partner for that and now
[24:36] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[24:38] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[24:40] a self custody solution where you
[24:43] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[24:46] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[24:49] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[24:52] your Bitcoin on there back up your seed
[24:54] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[24:59] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than a
[25:01] th000 in Bitcoin it's a absolutely must
[25:04] have I always compare to the sovereign
[25:06] individual and you have like small
[25:09] animals inside of a of a of a sue of a
[25:12] garden but all of the sudden those
[25:14] animals get like wings and and they can
[25:16] just fly out because right like if you
[25:19] have
[25:20] Bitcoin like if you have I don't know uh
[25:24] 50 million uh Euros uh in in Austria and
[25:29] you want to move that money to I don't
[25:32] know Brazil uh it's it's pretty hard how
[25:36] you do it like do it in Gold it's it's
[25:39] almost impossible because you have to
[25:41] move something physical through the
[25:42] world right yeah everyone will notice uh
[25:45] when you move it like with the banking
[25:47] system everything is recorded like you
[25:51] you you you basically uh everyone will
[25:54] know that but then how do you do that uh
[25:57] without being taxed a lot of things or
[26:01] how can you do it in a in a way that
[26:03] maybe even nobody notice it and the only
[26:06] way is is Bitcoin and we we never really
[26:10] had an opportunity to do that and I
[26:12] don't want to be saying that someone
[26:14] should avoid taxes or break the law and
[26:17] anything anything like that but just the
[26:19] possibility that it is possible and to
[26:22] you you can do that um opens up the
[26:26] whole world because all of the sudden
[26:29] uh countries have to set great
[26:32] incentives so the people and capital
[26:34] come to them because when when Europe
[26:37] makes a lot of around Bitcoin
[26:39] and does a lot of weird laws then we
[26:43] will move to I don't know India when
[26:45] they doing good stuff with Bitcoin or to
[26:47] El Salvador or to America or to any
[26:49] other country there are so many great
[26:51] countries in the world we're not binded
[26:53] by by one single count uh Country and
[26:56] this is the most
[26:58] amazing thing that I Envision uh
[27:01] happening for for that yeah yeah for
[27:03] sure so like countries want their people
[27:06] to not leave right like they want people
[27:08] to stay there so now it's done
[27:10] forcefully which is not good so uh with
[27:14] Bitcoin adopted like people if if they
[27:16] understand that bit people can move any
[27:17] moment because they have Bitcoin in the
[27:19] wallets now they will do great things
[27:22] for the country uh so that they actually
[27:24] want attract people to the country not
[27:27] by force force but actually creating
[27:29] value and creating infrastructure and
[27:31] giving that they want in a very honest
[27:34] way uh one question I don't know if uh
[27:38] if I think before we did not really
[27:40] cover it in detail what was actually the
[27:43] reason for you to to leave India like
[27:45] was it always like something that you
[27:47] you want to leave India was this always
[27:49] like like your dream or is there like a
[27:51] bigger reason behind
[27:53] it um so it happened as part of my job
[27:57] actually like so one thing is like for
[28:00] example if I want to build Bitcoin
[28:01] company in India it's not it's it's
[28:03] possible but it's it's like it falls
[28:05] into gray area there's no regulations
[28:07] right tomorrow if RBI is a like banking
[28:11] Institute Central Bank and it sends
[28:12] notifications to all the bank to stop
[28:14] working with any companies which is
[28:15] involved in cryptocurrencies we Sease to
[28:17] exist we can't operate as a business
[28:20] anymore it's too risky for us to build
[28:22] anything in India because there's no
[28:24] regulations right like I mean like like
[28:26] if if I was more of an engineer who
[28:29] wants to build good wallets yes of
[28:30] course I can live anywhere and India is
[28:33] a good place to live like I I like it's
[28:36] it's more topical like it's warm weather
[28:39] and like you can get both kind of life
[28:41] and I have my friends and family there I
[28:42] would love to live there but the main
[28:45] move towards Europe is because of I
[28:47] wanted to make this product possible
[28:49] right you know like being able to spend
[28:51] Bitcoin and adoption so it's not
[28:53] possible in India Whenever there is a
[28:55] license and then we can do this uh we
[28:58] defitely be there in India and me
[29:00] personally moving to Europe was because
[29:02] of my previous company so they were
[29:04] building payments payments apps for
[29:05] Europe and we wanted to move to Estonia
[29:08] to get our own licenses so we moved as a
[29:10] team and that's when I moved to Estonia
[29:14] and uh so again the reason was we were
[29:17] building for Europe again because of the
[29:19] regulations there were
[29:20] regulations so that's why Europe and uh
[29:23] and it's very hard in us because every
[29:26] States has its own regulations and then
[29:28] it's really hard to and there's a lot of
[29:30] products who already do amazing things
[29:31] so I think Europe needs one good one
[29:35] interesting
[29:37] yeah from my feeling is like America is
[29:43] is a little bit further ahead with the
[29:44] Bitcoin adoption uh but I have no clue I
[29:48] did not started a Bitcoin company there
[29:50] or then because great thing is like I
[29:53] have a podcast company uh where I can
[29:56] make everything like uh great Austrian
[29:59] Austrian regulation did not ask me what
[30:01] content I produce they they just uh I'm
[30:03] I'm officially a media company actually
[30:06] uh uh because I have sponsors and from
[30:08] them I get uh money for product
[30:11] placement basically and I get ad revenue
[30:13] and and all that stuff but uh and also
[30:16] uh I get directly money in Bitcoin with
[30:20] things like tipping and Fountain but
[30:22] that's like a really small part of it uh
[30:25] so in in in the eye of the regulation
[30:28] I'm just a media company I have nothing
[30:30] to do with Bitcoin which is a great
[30:31] thing and I will not uh name my company
[30:35] because when you start a company in
[30:37] Austria you actually don't have to name
[30:38] it until a certain uh Revenue threshold
[30:42] and till this threshold I will not name
[30:44] it anything and if I have to name it I
[30:47] will not name it with anything Bitcoin I
[30:49] want to be just like a media company
[30:51] that just happens to speak about Bitcoin
[30:53] I think I I I'm good is it also a reason
[30:57] why you did not bring Bitcoin into
[31:00] bringing like bringing has no no no
[31:02] Bitcoin name that's for example one of
[31:04] my sponsors 21 Bitcoin they brought
[31:06] Bitcoin in actually their name is there
[31:09] like a reason why you did not bring
[31:11] Bitcoin in
[31:13] bringing yeah so that's no like I was
[31:16] like I mean the name having Bitcoin I
[31:18] never really thought about it actually
[31:19] like uh it was just a name I thought
[31:21] about it as bring in but if I thought
[31:24] about any name like bit 21 Bitcoin I
[31:26] would think about it twice I would make
[31:28] sure to not have Bitcoin in the names
[31:30] for sure so even in like uh since we're
[31:33] a technology company we don't hold any
[31:35] licenses so uh we registered ourselves
[31:39] as a software development company so we
[31:41] build softwares on top of financial
[31:43] services so bring in is a software
[31:45] company for the registration in
[31:47] Lithuania eventually of course we want
[31:48] to we will change that as and when we
[31:50] get licenses and everything Bitcoin not
[31:53] being in the name as the reason is not
[31:57] to es skip from the regulations but
[31:59] maybe even if you thought about some
[32:00] name with
[32:03] Bitcoin uh we probably would not do that
[32:05] so we would just give it bring in bring
[32:07] in because it's like bringing in the
[32:10] next billion users to bitcoin so if
[32:12] you're bringing in people to bitcoin I I
[32:16] I love it uh we should definitely bring
[32:18] in uh people in in
[32:20] Bitcoin um one question to back to the
[32:24] India Roots I've noticed a trend uh
[32:28] especially since I have an Indian
[32:29] girlfriend a trend where there are so
[32:33] many big companies who have an Indian uh
[32:37] CEO or someone really high up in India
[32:40] uh then uh there's there's a lot lot of
[32:43] examples uh of that with yeah Uber with
[32:47] Google with with London uh with with all
[32:51] all that uh stuff
[32:53] but what I noticed is like when we
[32:56] talked a little bit before before that
[32:58] that the Indians are really um kind
[33:00] people usually uh they're really
[33:02] hardworking people they bring on a lot
[33:04] of um um Properties or or skills uh that
[33:10] the Western World usually don't has
[33:12] because they are I I don't want to be
[33:15] too rude but some are really
[33:18] spoiled and and I feel like this this
[33:20] hardworking uh spirit is more of course
[33:24] they're also probably lazy Indians and
[33:26] they are really hard working Europe like
[33:28] I don't want to generalize too much but
[33:30] I just see that the trend there is like
[33:32] a lot of successful Indians do you know
[33:35] did you notice anything where like uh
[33:38] that that you got from India or anything
[33:41] from culture wise or anything that you
[33:43] learn from from India or from the
[33:45] culture because you also lived in in
[33:47] Europe they like this was really good
[33:49] that I got it from India and it's is it
[33:52] really helps me develop the company and
[33:54] stuff like
[33:56] that uh yeah there couple of things so
[33:58] one being in India there are a lot of
[34:00] people and it's very competitive you
[34:02] have to be very competitive like you
[34:04] know you have to be best in the class
[34:06] like there's limited resources like
[34:07] Government College stess even for
[34:09] getting into a good engineering College
[34:11] you have to be the best among like you
[34:13] know like a lot of people so uh like
[34:16] being the competitiveness is being is
[34:18] not a choice for a better life because
[34:21] there a lot of people competing for the
[34:22] resources entirely the resources are
[34:24] scarce like good quality resources like
[34:26] good good quality Coles to study and and
[34:28] everything you have to be competent to
[34:31] be a part of them right so the
[34:33] competency
[34:34] is is part part of the culture I think
[34:37] like people are more competent because
[34:39] they have to get uh even getting
[34:40] government jobs are not easy getting
[34:42] into to good colleges are not easy
[34:44] otherwise you'll have to pay a lot of
[34:45] money unless you're too rich it's very
[34:47] hard to get into good colleges so
[34:48] competency is one part and then another
[34:51] part is so I'm like India is more like a
[34:55] spiritual place right like and I I I've
[34:58] I've been more on the spiritual side as
[35:01] well like I more I'm more into
[35:03] meditation and yoga and uh like yog guys
[35:06] really help me uh like in various parts
[35:10] of life you know
[35:11] like
[35:13] being composed in both hard and good
[35:16] times I don't like I would rather I I
[35:19] would be not
[35:21] so the way I am if I was not into yoga
[35:25] and uh and that's good that there's a
[35:28] lot of places like I mean right now you
[35:30] can like it's it's widely adopted
[35:31] everywhere in the world but it's it's
[35:33] it's everywhere in India like everyone
[35:36] every other places there like so many
[35:37] teachers and it's like it's so common
[35:40] there so that I think like the spiritual
[35:42] aspect of it and the high
[35:43] competitiveness see this both Factor
[35:46] kind of
[35:48] helps Indians to uh main the
[35:52] competitiveness compet competent like
[35:54] you have to be competitive to uh
[35:56] standard of among a lot of people so
[35:59] that is the reason I think
[36:01] is uh reflected in the outcome like
[36:05] working harder than other people in
[36:08] their peers or being more competent and
[36:11] trying to get out of their peers and
[36:13] doing something else something more so
[36:16] uh yeah I think competen is because of
[36:18] there a lot of people and that's a
[36:21] that's part of the culture that's one of
[36:22] the reason I think but yeah I mean there
[36:25] are and and also there are like bilon
[36:27] people to it's like like there are like
[36:31] highly competent people there are like
[36:33] if if India was filled with competent
[36:35] people why would India be the way it is
[36:36] right like it's not developed country so
[36:39] uh there are a lot of people so
[36:41] competent people would leave the country
[36:42] for better
[36:44] opportunities so hopefully India can
[36:46] give an environment for competent people
[36:48] to stay in the country yeah it's
[36:50] interesting how it goes because uh we
[36:53] have I always love the example of ralo
[36:56] ralo has this cycles of of uh continents
[37:00] rising and falling and we just see it
[37:04] now that the countries like India
[37:07] they're really hardworking they're great
[37:09] people uh
[37:10] like I worked in in in it security
[37:14] before and I worked with really big
[37:16] companies uh it's always funny there are
[37:18] like an an a leading management team in
[37:22] in Germany in Austria and stuff like
[37:24] that but the really the work is all done
[37:27] in India in in Poland in other countries
[37:30] except from Germany uh and of course the
[37:33] great workers from there they then uh
[37:36] transition to Germany and then they
[37:38] actually came to the management position
[37:40] so uh and then we came to the thing
[37:43] where hardworking people uh usually end
[37:47] up in good situation uh and people that
[37:50] don't work hard and they just sit in a
[37:53] management position because they they
[37:55] are German and they're like doing
[37:56] something they they will not have
[37:59] long-term success and this is like this
[38:02] um this a lot of people from that one
[38:05] continent working harder because it's
[38:07] not that good right now and then the
[38:09] other where it's really good they they
[38:12] they worked hard before but now they're
[38:14] like kind of on the downfall again it's
[38:17] it's fascinating to see that uh the the
[38:20] whole thing will be interesting also how
[38:23] India and and and Bitcoin and and and
[38:26] America shakes up and who adopts it
[38:30] first and who does it first and Game
[38:32] Theory is something really fascinating
[38:34] for me and that's what I love about the
[38:36] podcast being not German but English so
[38:39] I can speak with everyone around the
[38:40] world with Africans Indians Americans
[38:44] Canadians uh that's that's really
[38:46] something uh yeah really great to to
[38:49] have and compare the different world
[38:51] Parts yeah for sure so Bitcoin plays an
[38:54] major role in this like for a country to
[38:58] to you know like to have the like
[39:01] citizens in the country so more and more
[39:03] people learn about Bitcoin it's
[39:04] inevitable for countries to support
[39:06] Bitcoin and uh like embrace it not
[39:10] criticize or
[39:11] uh or like try to ban it or like try to
[39:15] put huge taxes on
[39:17] cryptocurrencies so uh Bitcoin
[39:20] definitely will be adopted in countries
[39:23] developing countries and I hopefully
[39:25] that will happen and uh
[39:28] I'm not too much into g game theater for
[39:29] how Nations pans out but I I kind of
[39:32] have a broad overview because living in
[39:34] India and living in Europe I understand
[39:35] there's a huge difference in stand of
[39:38] living and uh like in general India is
[39:41] more towards scarcity like there's few
[39:43] resources and there are more people for
[39:45] that and that creates a kind of
[39:47] mentality uh it could be either good or
[39:49] bad like it could good in a way where
[39:50] people are more competitive but in a way
[39:53] because people tend to do not ethical
[39:55] stuff to get that resources right so
[39:58] so in and here like I see more of
[40:01] abundance so compared to India right
[40:04] like there are resources and it's easily
[40:05] available for everyone so competen is
[40:07] less but there's no uh like people tend
[40:11] to do
[40:12] less uh like like it's so when there's
[40:16] scarcity there's more competitiveness
[40:18] and do anything to get that and like
[40:21] when you say anything to do that that
[40:23] kind
[40:24] of not normally is always like like you
[40:27] know morally
[40:30] or may not come in the
[40:32] moral uh side of things right so but
[40:36] that's good the countries have resources
[40:39] so that people don't have this do
[40:42] anything to get that attitude and there
[40:44] is abundance and there's resources
[40:46] available and everyone's happy so uh
[40:49] yeah eventually it's a positive some
[40:51] game it's not like one country can have
[40:54] more resources on the deprivation of
[40:56] another country like it's not like
[40:57] taking away resources it's it could be a
[40:59] positive sum game every country could
[41:02] get to a point where it's developed and
[41:04] have more resources for its
[41:05] citizens and people are free to move
[41:08] anywhere yeah that's that's that's the
[41:10] biggest thing I feel like um when we
[41:12] talk about and you said you you're on
[41:15] the spiritual spiritual end and and I
[41:17] see that with a lot of bitcoiners
[41:19] actually also um what would you say is
[41:22] the the spirit of satosi when you think
[41:25] of like when satosi is like the found
[41:27] and he got some spirit in into into
[41:29] Bitcoin what is that what is that spirit
[41:31] for
[41:32] you uh so like like satosi or Bitcoin
[41:36] itself is very like it's it's more
[41:38] spiritual in a way because it's more
[41:40] intuitional right like uh like see this
[41:42] is not just a technology which
[41:44] is uh just done out of experiments okay
[41:48] I implemented this technology it made a
[41:50] difference and then let it be it's it's
[41:52] not tested with centuries and people are
[41:54] using it it's just given and you need
[41:56] insane amount of intution and uh to do
[41:59] this so it's really hard to comprehend a
[42:02] person could do this it's uh it's it's
[42:04] very intuitional uh uh that Bitcoin came
[42:08] into existence from one person so so
[42:11] like the modern scientist is always like
[42:13] experiment try and then give the results
[42:16] right which the way it is right now but
[42:19] it takes a lot of intuition to give
[42:21] something without testing with the time
[42:23] it's a test of time right Bitcoin has to
[42:25] be tested over time centuries to see if
[42:27] it adopts as a main payment system but
[42:29] it's given with confidence that it will
[42:31] be adopted so uh that's very spiritual
[42:34] for me I love it a lot um before we come
[42:37] to the the end routine of the podcast
[42:39] I'm I'm I'm always asking that one
[42:42] question uh before we end up the podcast
[42:45] um and the reason I asked that question
[42:48] is because bitcoiners are really cool
[42:50] people and we can learn a lot from from
[42:52] each other uh and the question is what
[42:54] are you currently passionate about uh or
[42:57] deeply learning about besides Bitcoin uh
[43:00] besides Bitcoin to
[43:02] be like it's more about again Spiritual
[43:05] Development right like I want to be a
[43:07] better person so when I say that
[43:10] it's uh it's more about how do I handle
[43:14] myself when things go really well and
[43:16] when things go really bad so uh that's
[43:19] something that
[43:20] I'm kind of actively thinking about
[43:23] noticing
[43:24] it because and I think that is required
[43:27] for my journey and also that is
[43:29] something that I want to be like being
[43:31] composed in both good and bad times so
[43:33] uh it's not something that I'm learning
[43:36] from a book or I'm actually doing some
[43:38] courses but it's more about I'm putting
[43:40] a lot of thought into that and actively
[43:43] being doing self-awareness exercises to
[43:46] make sure that I'm in that
[43:49] path which is extremely important if you
[43:52] want to do anything in life so uh yes
[43:55] I'm very much like that the I also like
[43:58] the uh philosophy of of stoicism a lot
[44:03] uh and and and practicing that as good
[44:06] as I can even though it's not always
[44:08] easy but right uh it's it's it's a great
[44:11] great thing to to have uh but yeah uh
[44:14] let's come to the end rtin where the
[44:16] previous guest is asking a question for
[44:18] the next guest without knowing who the
[44:20] next guest actually is uh and your
[44:22] question is a question that came up I
[44:25] think already two times before
[44:27] uh it's it's the price question um when
[44:31] will we hit the1 million Us doll Mark uh
[44:35] it's very like I'm I'm very bad at
[44:37] predicting prices because I even when I
[44:40] came into Bitcoin I was not aware of
[44:42] what the price and never looked at the
[44:43] price but 1 million let me take a
[44:47] guess so uh 1, 100K and then multiple
[44:51] Cycles it's it's going to be at least uh
[44:55] like five years because the growth is
[44:57] always exponential like the next bullon
[44:59] will be bigger and bigger than the
[45:01] previous ones so five years I would say
[45:04] or that's too optimistic maybe like
[45:06] seven years I guess yeah it's
[45:09] it's it I always think like even like
[45:12] when we could reach like 200 or 300,000
[45:15] this year and I think like that's crazy
[45:18] and then there are people out they say
[45:19] like oh million this year and I'm like I
[45:21] don't know I I I really don't see the
[45:23] way there but we have seen that with
[45:26] Bitcoin before uh but yeah let's let's
[45:30] let's see what's what what comes yeah it
[45:31] could definitely happen much faster it's
[45:33] closer to 100K and then it's just 10x
[45:35] right and it has gone crazy high before
[45:37] so may maybe not five years it it
[45:39] happens much faster as well we we we
[45:43] just simply don't know it will happen at
[45:45] one point that's the only thing I'm I'm
[45:46] I'm fairly certain about um but the
[45:49] thing is um once we hit
[45:54] 100K uh that could trigger something
[45:58] really magical like this is uh like the
[46:03] last last one was like 10 uh K and we
[46:07] instantly jump to almost 20K when we
[46:10] when we hit that uh and like the 100K
[46:13] could be an interesting part where we
[46:14] like almost instantly hit like 200,000
[46:18] or maybe 300,000 and the difference what
[46:21] we have now is we have all the
[46:24] institutional money we have Micro
[46:26] strategy we we have ETFs we have really
[46:28] big companies now with a lot of freaking
[46:31] buying power uh that get also then all
[46:34] of this for more not just like 2017 was
[46:38] just retail Fox there were no big
[46:41] investors in there not really big
[46:42] investors India now the the wallets of
[46:46] the people that come into Bitcoin are
[46:48] just so much
[46:49] bigger so it's it's fun to imagine but
[46:53] honestly I really don't care I hope the
[46:55] we don't hit the 1 million because I'm
[46:57] young I'm 25 I want to Stack SS now and
[47:00] not not later so my like if we are
[47:03] ending up this year with 10K Bitcoin
[47:06] prizer would be really happy
[47:08] honestly but I don't see the chances
[47:11] honestly yeah yeah for sure
[47:13] so 100K would definitely be a good
[47:16] number because like and and a lot of
[47:18] other cryptocurrencies and a lot of
[47:19] other U like scam coins and all
[47:22] everything is just creating a bad it's
[47:26] not going good for the Bitcoin because
[47:28] people think Bitcoin is already at the
[47:30] high now let me buy some coins which is
[47:31] like which they don't know about and
[47:33] then they buy and they W know they think
[47:35] it's going to be like Bitcoin in future
[47:37] and they put a lot of money in there
[47:38] that's where all the money is going
[47:39] unfortunately so exactly when Bitcoin
[47:42] hits 100K they see that potential of
[47:44] Bitcoin is more and it still grows and
[47:45] at least for that they will start buying
[47:47] Bitcoin so you're you're right like when
[47:49] it it 100ks a lot of things happen not
[47:51] lot of things will change adoption will
[47:54] increase how did you actually avoid that
[47:56] that crypto sphere so you like focused
[48:00] on bitcoin as as I get it like how did
[48:02] you avoid or or did you avoid the
[48:04] altcoin fear so when I started like
[48:08] first thing is I read Bitcoin and then I
[48:10] was just focusing on bitcoin I started
[48:12] working last bit and the founder said
[48:13] he's like there's only Bitcoin there's
[48:14] nothing as blockchain and then he he
[48:16] explained me why he's like okay it's
[48:17] proof of work there's no proof of work
[48:18] in any other any other blockchain so
[48:21] like Bitcoin is not a blockchain
[48:23] blockchain is a concept derived from
[48:24] Bitcoin so and then it's and it's only
[48:26] been
[48:27] I was fortunate that I met him and then
[48:30] for a long term I didn't check the priz
[48:32] I didn't check for all coins and
[48:33] everything of course like not having to
[48:36] look at it will eventually you have to
[48:38] go there right so I did like I did
[48:40] explore especially as an curious
[48:41] engineer there were a lot of things
[48:42] going on uh like in ethereum you can run
[48:45] things and all that I got curious I got
[48:47] into uh that phase where I started uh
[48:50] trying out uh not not the coins or
[48:52] anything like that but the technology
[48:53] you know like building smart contracts
[48:56] and things like that and then it didn't
[48:57] take much time to understand and there
[48:58] were a lot of reasons for me to like uh
[49:01] feel like no this is not the thing and
[49:03] then get back to bitcoin and then once I
[49:05] got back it's it's it made it it was
[49:07] more and more obvious that why I should
[49:09] not never look into other tokens or
[49:11] anything like that it definitely is
[49:13] obvious and I'm already looking forward
[49:15] to meeting you at the Bitcoin only
[49:17] conference in Prague soon
