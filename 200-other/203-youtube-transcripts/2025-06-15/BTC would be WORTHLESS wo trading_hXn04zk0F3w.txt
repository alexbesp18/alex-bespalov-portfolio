[00:00] for every functional economy you need
[00:02] trading without Traders you don't have
[00:04] any price Discovery you don't have any
[00:05] exchange of assets your Bitcoins will be
[00:08] completely worthless because you will
[00:09] never be able to sell them it's a
[00:11] Bitcoin only product this was very
[00:13] important for us no one is really trying
[00:14] to remove this risk when trading are you
[00:17] a bitcoiner or not the time where money
[00:19] was just raining everywhere you need to
[00:21] be really really careful with not
[00:23] breaking anything on bitcoin what are
[00:26] DLCs today we cover a topic that I
[00:29] usually uh like a never covered actually
[00:32] at
[00:32] dlc's uh and probably that's the reason
[00:36] why because I am a hler like I don't
[00:39] trade I don't do anything like that so
[00:42] it's a a topic that's a little bit far
[00:44] off uh my personal realm but I thought
[00:46] like it's still an interesting topic and
[00:48] it's still like a Bitcoin Topic in in
[00:50] general and my goal with the podcast is
[00:52] like to have the widest range of Bitcoin
[00:54] guests on the podcast so I also have to
[00:57] invite people that are maybe a little
[00:59] bit outside of my personal uh experience
[01:02] so let's get started with the question
[01:04] like what are dlc's and pretend that
[01:08] that I'm 5 years old and I don't
[01:10] understand
[01:10] anything good well to explain DCS for a
[01:14] 5-year-old I guess you must be a really
[01:16] smart 5-year-old but let's go one step
[01:19] back because you you addressed an
[01:20] interesting topic about hling Bitcoin
[01:23] and I I went to a talk from Yuri I
[01:27] forgot his surname I'm sorry cyer Punk
[01:31] um he gave a talk about derivatives
[01:33] trading at Bitcoin de heck days at BTC
[01:37] PR last year and he started with a bold
[01:39] statement and said trading is
[01:43] [ __ ] and I think many bitcoiners
[01:47] particularly holders are related
[01:50] relating to that they say no I'm not
[01:52] trading I'm I'm hling but the thing is
[01:54] that for every functional economy you
[01:56] need trading without Traders you don't
[01:59] have any price Discovery you don't have
[02:01] any exchange of assets your Bitcoins
[02:04] would be completely worthless because
[02:06] you will never be able to sell them so
[02:08] you really really need the trading part
[02:12] and
[02:13] um anyway maybe we go into that a little
[02:16] bit later to answer your question what
[02:18] is a DLC a DLC is nothing else than a a
[02:22] technology which enables you to build
[02:24] contracts on bitcoin and they are
[02:26] enforcable on bitcoin so for your
[02:28] 5-year-old
[02:30] if you um have a toy and the other one
[02:33] has a candy and you want to exchange
[02:36] that you say Hey you can play with my
[02:38] toy if you give me your candy usually
[02:41] what happens is you take the candy and
[02:42] then run away and you never never hand
[02:46] over the toy but with a DLC with that
[02:49] contract you can ensure that the rules
[02:51] you set out in the first place are
[02:53] really executed so that you hand over
[02:56] your toy and you get the candy at the
[02:57] same time or Nothing at All gets
[03:00] exchanged and how does this get ured is
[03:03] there like a third party involved that
[03:05] handles that or is it on the Bitcoin
[03:07] blockchain like how does this
[03:10] work yeah exactly so there is a third
[03:13] party involved but it's an independent
[03:14] third party and that says that um it's a
[03:19] bit hard to relate to the example we
[03:21] just had but it just says that an event
[03:23] happened or it didn't happen uh let's
[03:26] just say for this example that you
[03:27] cannot eat that candy
[03:32] without okay having a hard time coming
[03:35] up aable example I cannot eat that candy
[03:38] without knowing a certain piece of
[03:40] information and the Oracle which is your
[03:43] kindergarten uh teacher she will just
[03:47] say all right um this event happened you
[03:50] have the candy you can eat it now and
[03:52] the other party can use the toy and only
[03:55] if she does that it's actually usable so
[03:58] in a more technical sense send um a
[04:01] signature which you need to be able to
[04:04] use whatever you
[04:06] receive and with that you like let's
[04:09] just make myself an example so I fully
[04:12] understood it like let's make like two
[04:15] uh people in the school they're like uh
[04:18] let's bet five candies each uh if it
[04:20] tomorrow rains and then they go to the
[04:23] uh teacher they give both the five
[04:25] candies to the teacher to the
[04:26] Independent party and then when tomorrow
[04:29] it actually rains the one says it rains
[04:31] the one says it does not rain and then
[04:33] the one that uh said it will rain uh
[04:36] actually gets the 10 candies uh of both
[04:39] of them and both don't have the
[04:42] possibility to back out because the
[04:43] candies are already with the teachers
[04:45] with the third party uh side is that did
[04:48] I understand it right no it's exactly
[04:51] not that way so this independent third
[04:54] party doesn't have any knowledge nor
[04:57] access to your funds so if if the two
[05:01] kids are betting about if it's going to
[05:03] rain tomorrow what they do is they lock
[05:05] up both their candies somewhere and they
[05:08] say all right we can only take it if the
[05:10] teacher says it actually rained or it
[05:12] did not rain and the teacher actually
[05:15] doesn't even know about the two parties
[05:17] betting it because it's somewhere in the
[05:20] drawer and they need they need the
[05:22] secret from the teacher so there is no
[05:25] no other third party really involved in
[05:28] that um in that bet
[05:30] maybe you can do a very very simple a
[05:32] little bit more complex for a 5-year-old
[05:34] but a more realistic example is a coin
[05:36] flip where you say all right you Robin
[05:39] say hats I say tail we lock up our money
[05:42] in this multi where only the two of us
[05:44] have access to it and only both of us
[05:47] can either spend the money or none of us
[05:50] and then what we do is we create two
[05:53] transactions from it which are not yet
[05:56] spendable um one transaction says you
[05:58] get all the funds um or the other
[06:00] transaction says I get all the funds
[06:02] depending on whether it's heads or tail
[06:05] and then there is an oracle which is a
[06:08] third party service and all it does is
[06:10] it 247 asserts to coin flips maybe
[06:14] there's a a coin flip every hour or
[06:16] every minute and it just says all right
[06:18] coin was hats coin was tail and it
[06:20] publishes signatures and then what we do
[06:23] is we can unilateral so completely
[06:26] independent from each other take that
[06:28] signature to event and put it into our
[06:32] in one of those transactions which then
[06:34] becomes valid and then we can spend
[06:36] it that's makes a lot more sense now for
[06:39] me thank you for giving this example uh
[06:42] and I think we have now a a basic
[06:45] understanding on dlc's is U let's get
[06:47] because you triggered uh you you
[06:49] mentioned it before like uh trading and
[06:51] a lot of Bitcoin hodlers actually say
[06:53] that there's this uh thing where like
[06:55] trading and then it gets [ __ ]
[06:57] because you can reble the this I think a
[07:00] really famous meme in in the Bitcoin
[07:02] Community um maybe there's like a little
[07:04] bit of a also disconnect between like
[07:07] day trading short-term trading and just
[07:10] like trading in general because what I'm
[07:13] doing in in with a podcast we can also
[07:16] say like it's a kind of a trading
[07:18] because I give uh uh value with a
[07:21] podcast in a video form and the others
[07:23] give me time with the time they might
[07:25] spend something on the sponsors or on
[07:27] the YouTube links that way I could
[07:29] indect direct money for that like
[07:31] everything we are doing is kind of a
[07:32] trade in life everything is somewhere a
[07:35] trade if I give someone time I give
[07:37] someone money with with no trade
[07:40] obviously we don't have an economy
[07:42] because everybody is not doing anything
[07:44] with each other so that's 100% uh right
[07:48] um but like I think lot of the people
[07:50] are like okay I just want to have my
[07:53] Bitcoin and maybe exchange it for later
[07:55] like just buy something with it which is
[07:58] also a trade uh but it's like not a not
[08:00] a shortterm trade like oh that's bet
[08:03] like 50% of the netw worth on some
[08:05] outcome tomorrow or something like that
[08:07] um let's get a little bit in that topic
[08:09] what do you think of of of that or like
[08:11] do you also see the discon the the
[08:14] difference between short-term day
[08:15] trading and long-term
[08:17] trading yeah there's totally a
[08:19] difference and I think the the related
[08:23] terminologies are trading versus
[08:25] investing obviously you can then say
[08:27] does shortterm trading or day trading
[08:29] and long-term trading um I guess most
[08:33] hodlers are more on the investing side
[08:35] of things they invest in Bitcoin and
[08:36] they hold it for a long time and sell it
[08:39] or if even ever going to sell it or
[08:41] borrow against it in the future um and
[08:44] then there are the day traders who try
[08:46] to make money out of um the the Bitcoin
[08:51] volatility then so there are those who
[08:54] really like to take risk they think they
[08:56] know how the price moves and just take
[08:58] some money
[09:00] um but there are also the conservative
[09:01] ones who' like to protect themselves and
[09:04] those are most of the time overlooked
[09:06] and I think they are very very
[09:08] interesting because for example a a
[09:10] business like a
[09:12] minor it has to pay for electricity and
[09:15] it has to pay for the machines and maybe
[09:18] employees but the Bitcoin price is
[09:20] volatile and they cannot immediately
[09:23] spend those Bitcoins or they don't
[09:25] immediately have the rewards so what
[09:27] they should do is they to take the
[09:30] Bitcoin they have and hch it get a
[09:32] downside protection against the bit the
[09:35] US dollar price so that they can pay for
[09:39] the um the upcoming bills and that's
[09:43] that's basically nothing else than
[09:45] shorting Bitcoin with a leverage of one
[09:48] or maybe even more a higher leverage but
[09:51] you're shorting Bitcoin to be to get a
[09:53] downside protection until a certain
[09:56] price yeah and this is I think there are
[09:59] a lot of things you you can do I was
[10:02] before Bitcoin I was actually in the
[10:04] stock market and I mess around a little
[10:07] bit with shorts and long positions with
[10:10] with stop things and stuff like that I
[10:11] was not successful with it because I did
[10:14] understand it also fully just to very
[10:17] transparent uh and for myself it's just
[10:19] like like for me it's like I'm I'm
[10:21] saving in Bitcoin I see as my savings
[10:24] account and then we try to just provide
[10:26] value and get money from from that side
[10:27] but obviously there are a lot of use
[10:29] cases for that because there was no use
[10:31] case for it obviously then nobody would
[10:33] do it uh long term um for the dlc's what
[10:37] like um what do you see as like the most
[10:40] broad use cases that people will do with
[10:43] it like what are the like the the
[10:46] mainstream use obviously nothing in
[10:48] Bitcoin is mainstream because Bitcoin
[10:49] itself is is not mainstream but inside
[10:52] of the Bitcoin Community inside of the
[10:54] DLC uh Community what what are the like
[10:57] the the biggest use cases uh
[11:01] that that's a good question um I guess
[11:05] if you go really really abstract the
[11:07] biggest use case is betting betting on
[11:10] anything it could be um sports betting
[11:13] it could be betting on the event like
[11:16] prediction markets uh could be political
[11:18] events betting uh but it could also be
[11:21] betting on financial products and that's
[11:23] basically what trading is and if I think
[11:27] there are only two main companies out
[11:30] there who are building on Doc's right
[11:32] now and that is atomic Finance who's
[11:34] building covered C options and now also
[11:37] put options um and usus we build
[11:39] derivatives trading so in atomic Finance
[11:43] use case they offer users to generate a
[11:46] yield on top of the Bitcoin um while in
[11:49] our case we enable users to trade
[11:52] Bitcoins without having to leave the
[11:54] save Haven of
[11:56] Bitcoin so if you are to to go back back
[11:59] to your questions I think the most
[12:00] common use cases to use dlc's today are
[12:03] trading and it's either yield producing
[12:05] products or derivatives tradings with
[12:07] our
[12:08] tools amazing and uh because you imagine
[12:11] it now like what is actually der
[12:14] derivative trading I have a hard time
[12:16] saying that as an Austrian uh and and
[12:19] what is the company uh you're doing is
[12:22] like one 10 10 One Finance right this as
[12:25] you have it on the T-shirt
[12:26] also yeah well thanks for pronouncing it
[12:30] correctly most people say 1011 or
[12:35] 10101 it wasn't the best choice um 10
[12:38] 101 the the number is the binary number
[12:42] for 21 as in 21 million Bitcoin and we
[12:47] picked that name because non-custodial
[12:49] is for us the most important thing and
[12:53] we want to solve the problem of removing
[12:55] counterparty risk of
[12:57] trading and when we started that must
[13:01] have been like I think two years ago um
[13:03] there was no other asset on bitcoin I
[13:04] mean there was counterparty but besides
[13:07] that there's no possibility to have any
[13:09] other assets on bitcoin besides Bitcoin
[13:11] so if you wanted to build trading
[13:13] Solutions you have to build
[13:16] derivatives and a derivative is a
[13:18] financial product which as the name
[13:21] already implies derives the value from
[13:25] or the price from a certain product so
[13:27] in our case we have a Bitcoin USD
[13:32] derivatives which derives the price from
[13:35] the Bitcoin to USD spot trading
[13:39] and differently said you can bet on the
[13:42] Bitcoin price against US dollars but
[13:45] it's settled in Bitcoin so if the if you
[13:47] say um I want to go long against Bitcoin
[13:50] you bet the Bitcoin price goes up and if
[13:52] the price goes up you get more Bitcoin
[13:55] same as if you say um you go price goes
[13:58] up but the price goes down you lose in
[14:00] Bitcoin terms and what we do concretely
[14:04] is we build a non-custodial trading
[14:06] solution for users so that means that
[14:09] you can trade out of your wallet without
[14:11] having to trust your counterparty so you
[14:13] don't have to send your hard earned
[14:15] money to an exchange or um to an
[14:19] escrow uh or in another multi it's
[14:23] literally just you and your
[14:25] counterparty and that's
[14:28] it is that one step closer to we coming
[14:32] to the world where everything is built
[14:34] on bitcoin like there's like the base
[14:36] layer of Bitcoin and we're trying to
[14:37] like just uh build the financial system
[14:40] now as you say s custodial on bitcoin
[14:43] DLCs on bitcoin is this just one more
[14:46] part of building the traditional Finance
[14:49] systems also on bitcoin yeah totally
[14:52] that's our very long-term Vision to have
[14:55] a financial economy without a
[14:57] centralized Authority and you can build
[15:00] the whole stock market on top of Bitcoin
[15:02] so that you can trade your Tesla your
[15:04] Apple shares and settle that in
[15:08] Bitcoin is is that of like um I often
[15:11] talk about like Bitcoin will be the Bas
[15:13] layer of everything uh and 50% of all
[15:16] the interactions we are doing because
[15:18] 50% of every interaction is money and if
[15:21] Bitcoin becomes actually Global Reserve
[15:23] currency Reserve money then it will be
[15:25] 50% of everything we are doing um but
[15:29] when we now coming to the stock market
[15:31] where we like have a huge system already
[15:33] built where the SEC and everything is
[15:36] involved like there's a there's a huge
[15:38] market for exactly that will that also
[15:42] come on bitcoin somehow tokenized uh on
[15:46] bitcoin or can some of the traditional
[15:49] system be still there but we're building
[15:53] Bitcoin just as money as an a hybrid
[15:56] system how do you see like the future of
[15:58] of Bitcoin like maybe a little bit long
[16:00] term uh and uh displaying
[16:03] out that is a really good question it's
[16:05] not another the question is what is
[16:07] bitcoin is Bitcoin the asset or is
[16:10] Bitcoin the blockchain and I'm referring
[16:14] to when I say Bitcoin is actually both
[16:17] Bitcoin is an asset and it's a
[16:18] blockchain and the blockchain is a
[16:20] settlement layer so what you can do in
[16:22] the the most Bitcoin maximal way is you
[16:25] settle only Bitcoin transactions where
[16:28] the value you trans ER is Bitcoin and
[16:30] there are certain security assumptions
[16:32] if you would settle something else
[16:34] that's why there the hardcore Bitcoin
[16:36] maximalists would say we don't want any
[16:39] token but basically you could settle
[16:41] anything and we have seen the the recent
[16:45] weeks the the runes and ordinal and
[16:48] other nfts which are also just settled
[16:51] on bitcoin I think this will come more
[16:53] and more um block space is expensive so
[16:56] there will be certain ways to abstract
[16:58] it move it on to layer two but Bitcoin
[17:01] is the the most secure decentralized
[17:05] settlement layer and I see no reason why
[17:08] we wouldn't settle anything else than
[17:10] just Bitcoin transactions like why
[17:12] wouldn't we have a public record of our
[17:15] properties in there or why wouldn't we
[17:17] have our um company shares the stock
[17:20] market onto it I think it just really
[17:22] makees sense to have it really on there
[17:24] maybe not everything on the main chain
[17:27] that might be too much um but but on
[17:29] another layer on top of it yeah I mean
[17:32] this will the free market will take care
[17:33] of it because main chain will be really
[17:36] expensive at one point uh and not every
[17:39] application will be able to even do that
[17:41] economically on the main chain because
[17:43] now of course you can do it because the
[17:45] the costs are like bearable but uh like
[17:49] try to figure out everything put it on
[17:51] the main chain and the fees are going
[17:54] high up and uh people will be priced out
[17:56] I don't know how many people and
[17:59] institution can transact on a monthly
[18:01] basis with each other maybe like 10
[18:03] million uh realistically that's it's
[18:06] hard to figure out the number how many
[18:08] institutions and people can actually do
[18:09] it because at some point you will have
[18:11] the lower end user and he will be priced
[18:14] up as someone new coming in and
[18:16] outbidding him and then they have to
[18:18] move up the the ladder then there's also
[18:20] utxo management uh coming in because
[18:23] when you have small UT takes over all of
[18:24] the sudden might be possible that in the
[18:27] future you don't you cannot move your
[18:29] Bitcoin anymore but that's a whole
[18:31] another topic
[18:34] should uh let's let's focus on on on
[18:37] bitcoin uh like Ju Just to be clear like
[18:40] this is only a Bitcoin product like you
[18:42] don't do anything with altcoins or is
[18:45] the altcoin uh aspect to
[18:47] it no it's a it's a Bitcoin only product
[18:51] and as this was very important for us we
[18:54] did in the past so we we started with
[18:56] cross chain Atomic swaps and enabled
[18:59] users to trade without counterparty risk
[19:01] from one chain into the other but we
[19:04] learned that most bitcoiners they don't
[19:06] want to leave just Safe Haven they want
[19:08] to increase the Bitcoin Holdings while
[19:10] trading certain assets like for example
[19:14] um trade the ethereum Bitcoin pair which
[19:16] is also quite volatile um but you don't
[19:20] they don't want to hold ethereum because
[19:22] it's a whole different um risk
[19:25] assumption to whole ethereum which might
[19:28] or might not Fork again or do whatever
[19:31] they do so we said no we need to build
[19:34] something on top of Bitcoin where you
[19:37] are in your in your safe haven and yeah
[19:40] derivatives are the the only way so we
[19:43] are a Bitcoin only product build on
[19:45] bitcoin for bitcoiner how would how's
[19:47] this um this Pampers guy in in German TV
[19:52] from bitcoiners inspired for bitcoiners
[19:54] created you know what I'm refer it
[19:57] to uh I think and know like uh for uh
[20:01] for babies from babies inspired for
[20:04] babies cre that's saying in
[20:08] chairman that's a nice one yeah if you
[20:11] are listening to this podcast you might
[20:13] be wondering what is actually the setup
[20:15] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[20:18] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[20:20] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[20:22] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[20:24] right way let's focus on the first thing
[20:26] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple a Bitcoin
[20:29] only exchange don't deal with the
[20:31] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[20:33] exchange that has an own token or
[20:35] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[20:37] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[20:40] for me the best partner for that and now
[20:44] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[20:46] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[20:48] a self custody solution where you
[20:51] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[20:54] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[20:57] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[21:00] your Bitcoin on there back up your seed
[21:02] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[21:06] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than a
[21:09] th000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[21:12] have one last thing before we get back
[21:14] to the video I'm really passionate about
[21:16] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[21:18] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[21:21] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[21:24] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[21:27] conference in whole of Europe for all
[21:29] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[21:32] this place in June for all europees it's
[21:34] a must go anyways you are so close to
[21:37] the Bitcoin PR conference you basically
[21:39] have to come I will do interviews there
[21:42] and I would love to meet you all there
[21:44] use code Robin for all my sponsors to
[21:47] get discounts and use the links down in
[21:50] the description why did you actually
[21:51] choose to to work B like how did you
[21:53] come into the the Bitcoins uh sphere I
[21:56] think you listen to the Steven ver
[21:59] podcast you did I think it was early on
[22:02] 2014 or something like that
[22:04] even yeah so I got into Bitcoin I heard
[22:08] about it quite earlier I not claiming
[22:10] that I understood anything until like
[22:12] maybe 2017 or so um but I lost money at
[22:16] Mount G and that really branded me I I I
[22:21] remember that it was like um so what do
[22:25] I do now who do I call where do I get my
[22:29] money back I was just just gone and I
[22:32] mean it it was honestly my own fault
[22:34] because I kind of understood this
[22:37] non-cost aspect of Bitcoin already but I
[22:40] wanted to trade at the same time so
[22:43] similar to you I have a bit of a trading
[22:45] background and it's just natural to keep
[22:47] your money somewhere on an exchange or a
[22:50] bank or somewhere where you want to
[22:53] trade and it's just gone so I thought
[22:56] that this is just a big scam um I'm not
[22:59] going to use it and but I got then back
[23:02] into it and said no one is really trying
[23:05] to solve that problem no one is really
[23:07] trying to remove this risk when trading
[23:11] and I think this is one of the most
[23:13] important problems to solve because if
[23:16] you believe in Bitcoin and if you
[23:18] believe in non- custodian of Bitcoin you
[23:21] should also trade non-custodial you
[23:24] should not trade custodial and every
[23:28] everyone who says the market for
[23:30] noncustodial is too small I'm going to
[23:32] be like are you a bitcoiner or not if
[23:35] you believe in Bitcoin then there is
[23:37] only non-custodial trading everything
[23:39] else is you're trading I you don't trade
[23:42] Bitcoins and I think that say huge
[23:45] business opportunity huge market and
[23:48] it's still a hardly solved
[23:50] problem yeah and I think we like we had
[23:53] Bitcoin really early and then products
[23:56] and services and companies on top of
[23:58] Bitcoin here really early on uh because
[24:02] all for first you have to solve the
[24:04] protocol and and get this protocol in in
[24:07] people's head and then you can uh make
[24:10] other things just quick question I heard
[24:12] from mon Cox that people are getting
[24:14] their money slowly back but I don't know
[24:17] I never researched deeply but maybe
[24:19] because you had exposure do you know
[24:21] more about it do do you get your money
[24:23] back some of it yeah so you could are
[24:26] you you're getting some parts in a Fiat
[24:29] and some parts in Bitcoin don't exactly
[24:32] ask me how much what the exchange rate
[24:34] was so it's not not good um but the I
[24:38] think they started paying it out already
[24:40] or it is um on the go right
[24:43] now I haven't r i yet so yeah yeah I
[24:47] think it's but I heard it like half a
[24:50] year ago that they are paying it back
[24:52] which be which is interesting because
[24:54] this were like forced
[24:56] todlers but obviously only get a small
[24:59] percentage back or like this maybe you
[25:01] don't get anything back let's see how it
[25:04] all uh playar longterm um what do you
[25:07] think you also get Bitcoin Bitcoin cash
[25:09] back sorry you also get Bitcoin cash
[25:15] back yes it's interesting but like
[25:20] Bitcoin C was not M go before Bitcoin
[25:23] cash wait yeah but since you since you
[25:27] hold Bitcoin at the time of the fork
[25:30] they basically doubled the coins and you
[25:33] have a a claim on this Bitcoin cash how
[25:37] did you live through uh the the whole
[25:39] Bitcoin cash scene like you were there
[25:43] uh in 2017 uh and you hold held Bitcoin
[25:46] in that time how was that uh a period of
[25:49] time for for you in the Bitcoin
[25:51] sphere that was an amazing time it was
[25:54] the time where money was just raining
[25:57] everywhere to air drops and iOS and
[26:01] forks and Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin SV
[26:04] and Bitcoin gold and Bitcoin private and
[26:08] know what else and the hard part was you
[26:11] just have to dump it as fast as possible
[26:13] otherwise the price is going to
[26:15] crash but it was definitely an exciting
[26:18] time it was fun do you foresee that we
[26:21] get such a bull market again I feel like
[26:24] the 2021 bull market was not as crazy
[26:26] like we did not have the crazy of of
[26:29] 2017 uh 2021 was a little bit more
[26:32] calmer like I don't know it was not that
[26:35] uh exciting there was not this massive
[26:37] up swing in price all of of course Tesla
[26:40] El musk there was some drama in there
[26:42] there was some some nice things in there
[26:44] and there was late at Celsius so there
[26:47] there was some stories in there of
[26:48] course it was not boring it's never
[26:50] really boring in Bitcoin but the
[26:52] craziness of 2017 I feel like there was
[26:55] not that massive thing do we do do you
[26:58] think we get that in that bull run was
[27:00] that like a little bit cut off of the
[27:02] last bull run because uh there was like
[27:04] this China thing and and so
[27:06] on no I think the answer is
[27:09] regulations like 2015 2016 no one had an
[27:14] idea what is legal what is not legal and
[27:17] then when 2016 when the Ico started and
[27:20] 2017 when it peaked there was already
[27:23] rumor that these are unregulated
[27:26] securities and you had to be very care
[27:28] ful and how you you name those this
[27:30] token and what you promis but it was
[27:33] still the wide west and people did just
[27:36] whatever they want then um later on we
[27:39] had what do they call it exchange issued
[27:44] tokens or something exchange issued
[27:48] offering token offering or something so
[27:51] was not an Ico where you had to buy in
[27:53] but the tokens were dis distributed and
[27:56] you had airdrops and all kind of things
[27:57] so the they always try to get around
[28:00] just the the regulations but it's
[28:03] getting harder and harder and it's or
[28:05] it's getting more clear on what is legal
[28:07] and what is not legal and that probably
[28:09] slowed down the the 2021 bull market but
[28:13] it was different like 2021 was the The
[28:16] Lending and the yield farming where you
[28:20] it was also possible to get money from
[28:22] everywhere and people just tried to add
[28:25] decentralization on anything thing let's
[28:29] just put it in a smart contract and call
[28:31] it a decentralized thing uh but we hold
[28:33] the private keys and we can upgrade
[28:36] it h
[28:38] yeah I think the next bull market will
[28:41] be l2s on top of
[28:44] Bitcoin we saw the hype already in
[28:47] recent weeks with um
[28:49] op CVM and bit VM and then um Citroen or
[28:55] whatever there are different l2s who are
[28:58] trying to build some ckp verifiers based
[29:02] um layer tws on top of
[29:05] Bitcoin they will all try to create
[29:08] their own side chains have their own
[29:10] tokens
[29:11] and same same idea as an Ico again get a
[29:15] token and dump it on
[29:17] retail is there is there uh for you uh
[29:21] the one of the most promising Layer Two
[29:23] is is lightning or you see some other
[29:25] Solutions uh coming up like go there are
[29:28] a lot of problems with lightning some
[29:30] other like others more some think like
[29:32] lightning will be the clue that has more
[29:35] of the highways where the other layer
[29:38] twos or layer threes are connected with
[29:40] each other like how do you see the the
[29:42] scaling Solutions than the the
[29:45] Bitcoin yeah I guess we need to agree on
[29:48] what is a layer two and I I'm of the
[29:52] opinion that and Layer Two needs to you
[29:55] need to have the possibility to
[29:56] unilaterally exit it meaning you need to
[29:59] be able to get in and out of that L2
[30:02] without having to ask for permission and
[30:06] everything else
[30:08] is something else it could be I mean
[30:12] it's it's liquid and L2 I don't know to
[30:16] some degree I think you can get in um
[30:19] without having to ask for permission but
[30:21] if you want to get out without
[30:23] permissions you need to do an atomic
[30:25] swap otherwise you have to go through
[30:27] the functionary or the
[30:29] validators and they need to sign uh the
[30:32] transaction and release the
[30:34] money these promised l2s um they for
[30:39] example those who build on bit VM they I
[30:42] think they are optimistic in the sense
[30:44] of you can get in and out um but you
[30:47] still have some form of um what is it
[30:50] called a sequencer or something so you
[30:52] still have some centralized party on top
[30:53] of it which needs to ensure that the
[30:55] whole thing functions most most of those
[30:59] l2s they need certain op codes uh maybe
[31:03] opcat the most simple one um or some
[31:06] transaction covant up codes and I think
[31:09] if we get those up codes we can build
[31:12] completely different stuff I would I
[31:14] think the last thing I would do is build
[31:15] a L2 in the sense of ethereum l2s where
[31:18] you have an evm complete side chain
[31:21] which is a whole new blockchain because
[31:23] you have all kind of different problems
[31:26] like for starter EV m is in my opinion
[31:29] completely broken and insecure I mean
[31:31] it's been around now since 10 years but
[31:34] it's still it's JavaScript and I don't
[31:36] want to write Financial product in
[31:39] JavaScript um but on the other hand you
[31:42] you have another blockchain on top of it
[31:45] so you need to produce blocks and then
[31:46] you need to build some consensus
[31:48] algorithm on top of it uh maybe add
[31:51] proof of work on top of it was like this
[31:54] does not scale that's not an proper L2
[31:58] so why don't we use some more complex
[32:00] opcodes to build something on top of
[32:03] Bitcoin and I think that's where um CVM
[32:05] wants to get into with recursive
[32:09] transaction Covenant where
[32:11] you basically enable arbitary executions
[32:15] on top of Bitcoin similar to bit
[32:18] VM and you were also a coder I think if
[32:22] I get got it right like you were in
[32:24] software development or you still
[32:25] developing software oh yeah yeah oh you
[32:29] might hear it how I talk yes I'm
[32:31] definitely a quarter at hard care so I'm
[32:34] I'm coding active here every day it's
[32:37] it's fascinating for me because I have a
[32:39] hard time uh talking with software I I'm
[32:44] also software develop like I came from
[32:46] that scene now I'm not doing it anymore
[32:48] I did it like for three and a half years
[32:50] like full-time on in a company uh back
[32:53] end and front end uh so I know it but
[32:56] I'm not good in it that's why I stopped
[32:59] it I'm just not the the the best coder
[33:02] uh um but for me it was always
[33:04] interesting when I talk with coders they
[33:07] often have a hard time understanding
[33:09] Bitcoin there are a lot of things that a
[33:12] coder does not
[33:14] initially understand about Bitcoin like
[33:16] first of all of course the whole um
[33:18] Finance side of it like we don't you
[33:20] have to understand money also to
[33:22] understand Bitcoin and not just the
[33:24] technical stuff in it but also that
[33:26] Bitcoin is not not moving as fast like
[33:29] it's a coder they has like one or two
[33:31] week Sprint where they're like
[33:32] developing new stuff it's always new
[33:34] features fixed bu fixing and stuff like
[33:37] that but in Bitcoin you have a working
[33:40] systems and you don't want to touch it
[33:41] too
[33:43] much if you if you touch too much the
[33:45] base layer you might have you might
[33:47] break it um how was it for you to get
[33:49] into Bitcoin with the coding mind that
[33:52] was just helping you or was it maybe
[33:53] even uh bad for
[33:55] you no I can totally relate to that um I
[33:59] got into bitco from a technical
[34:01] perspective and I appreciated the
[34:04] distributed system side of Bitcoin
[34:07] because I was studying distributed
[34:08] system Technologies and I thought that W
[34:11] so all of this stuff what we learning
[34:13] right now from bit bantine fa tolerance
[34:16] to peer-to-peer
[34:18] messaging that can be used in a tool
[34:21] which is basically money I mean I don't
[34:23] understand money but the technology was
[34:25] really cool and so I definitely got from
[34:29] the technical side of things in there
[34:31] and I don't want to but I think I have
[34:34] to admit that I during 2016 2017 I
[34:38] looked to the ethereum side and was like
[34:40] these guys are moving really fast and
[34:42] they're building so much stuff that is
[34:44] cool but it took me a while to realize
[34:47] that you don't want to move fast you
[34:48] want to be safe you want to be secure
[34:51] because Bitcoin is just
[34:54] more and if you accidentally break it
[34:58] then we don't have another chance like
[35:00] if we need to Fork Bitcoin because we
[35:03] broke it then the biggest promise of
[35:05] Bitcoin is broken we changed something
[35:09] and so we need to be really really
[35:11] careful with not breaking anything on
[35:13] bitcoin and really really careful with
[35:14] adding stuff on bitcoin which could make
[35:17] the whole the base use case could change
[35:21] the base use case so is there any
[35:26] yeah uh is there any if you like if you
[35:28] would be the god of Bitcoin is there
[35:30] anything you would actually change or is
[35:32] is uh is there is it perfect as it is
[35:35] like would you integrate anything in the
[35:37] the base layer protocol that you're like
[35:39] okay we we should have this small update
[35:41] or this big update in in
[35:44] Bitcoin well I would love to have some
[35:46] form of transaction covenants with some
[35:50] form of transaction Covenant may be
[35:52] offcat or um CTV or I don't know what
[35:56] the others are out there
[35:58] we can build quite a bit and we actually
[36:00] were building on top of liquid for some
[36:02] time where we built some some form of
[36:06] non-custodial lending where you put up
[36:08] Bitcoin as a collateral and then you get
[36:10] a stab coin as a loan back and all of
[36:14] this without without counterparty risk
[36:17] without having to ask for permissions
[36:19] and this was done with opcat and object
[36:22] s from stack and if you get this on top
[36:25] of Bitcoin I mean things will be quite
[36:28] pricey because you need to put a little
[36:32] bit more data on chain but you can build
[36:34] so many more use
[36:36] cases yeah I had an discussion with
[36:40] Wicket I think two three episodes ago
[36:43] where we talked about uh utxo management
[36:46] uh where we need when we want to scale
[36:49] utxos and self custodial on main chain
[36:52] uh we need to have some way of sharing
[36:55] utos maybe even with like 100 people or
[36:58] 200 people or thousand people uh and uh
[37:02] that needs to to have the seems to be
[37:06] the consensus that something might
[37:09] change in the future and this is might
[37:11] be necessary to actually scale Bitcoin
[37:14] uh but I I'm always careful with with
[37:18] promoting uh change on
[37:20] bitcoin yeah but uh it seems to be this
[37:23] CTV I heard a lot that people really
[37:26] like it uh uh and yeah let's let's see
[37:28] what happens uh and uh I think Bitcoin
[37:32] is so strong and especially 2017 I proed
[37:36] that point where the whole industry
[37:38] basically was against Bitcoin and was
[37:40] for Bitcoin cash with the miners and a
[37:42] lot of uh famous voices also in Bitcoin
[37:45] back then uh and still the users the
[37:48] nodes decided otherwise and Bitcoin uh
[37:51] LIF on as it seems because the free
[37:53] market decides what actually has value
[37:55] and what not so it's an an interesting
[37:58] interesting um in this video just us be
[38:01] and observe it and and be an player in
[38:04] the the
[38:05] sphere um you have uh also probably
[38:09] moved to Australia at some point uh
[38:12] because you said that we are now in in
[38:13] Australia and and you come from Austria
[38:16] uh I think uh and for me it's
[38:19] interesting when we look at the whole
[38:21] world and why people move uh and for me
[38:25] it's like a lot of Bitcoins are now
[38:26] moving to El Salvador um maybe like like
[38:30] what's your thoughts on El Salvador and
[38:32] then like why Australia probably this
[38:35] was before as I was Bitcoin
[38:37] country yeah I mean Australia was a a
[38:41] very personal choice I came here in 2012
[38:45] during un doing my studies as in an
[38:47] exchange semester and I just love love
[38:51] this this big island it's just beautiful
[38:53] I love the Outback the the middle of
[38:55] nowhere the nothing
[38:57] um but we actually wanted to leave
[39:01] Australia last year or we left Australia
[39:03] last year and we explored Latin America
[39:06] and I was also in El
[39:07] Salvador and I could feel that there is
[39:11] there is a certain movement in El
[39:13] Salvador it's it feels it's definitely
[39:17] feels safe but I think the jump from a
[39:21] very very developed country like
[39:23] Australia or Austria to El Salvador is a
[39:27] very big one and you might underestimate
[39:31] that it's going to take a few years if
[39:33] not even a generation or two before El
[39:36] Salvador is deemed to be a really secure
[39:39] country and the corruptness from you you
[39:42] can't just remove it tomorrow by
[39:45] exchanging the top of the leader I mean
[39:47] isn't he currently um watching his own
[39:52] team um suing them for corruptness or
[39:54] something so it's it's doesn't change
[39:58] until tomorrow the feeling the passion
[40:00] was really cool it feels like a very
[40:02] young startup where everyone is pushing
[40:05] in the same direction they believe in
[40:06] the same thing but at the same time it's
[40:08] so fragile and you just don't know where
[40:12] it's going to end so if you're an yeah
[40:15] early investor it might be good to
[40:17] invest in there and see if you can take
[40:19] something from the upside but um a bit
[40:22] more
[40:23] careful I mean as alvados uh started
[40:26] from the bottom right was literally one
[40:28] of the worst countries to be in uh and
[40:31] uh they had a lot of problems before
[40:33] that and now this try to move up and uh
[40:37] there's a lot of question marks and also
[40:40] long-term viability because they have to
[40:42] prove also that the things that they are
[40:44] now moving in the right direction can
[40:46] move long term in the right direction
[40:48] like it's easy to steer the country for
[40:51] short term it's really hard to to steer
[40:53] the massive Direction in from a country
[40:55] in a in a completely different
[40:58] uh Direction that's it's really cool uh
[41:00] to to see and to observe uh and I want
[41:03] to visit there this year uh because I
[41:06] had like 10 people I think already on
[41:08] that were in El Salvador or moved to El
[41:12] Salvador and it's a fascinating to see
[41:15] kind of everybody has the same feelings
[41:17] about it it's like a a country
[41:20] startup hear that a lot uh from salador
[41:23] and yeah but uh let's come closer to the
[41:26] end of the podcast uh before we get to
[41:29] the end of the end routine of the
[41:31] podcast what are you currently really
[41:33] passionate about or studying because I
[41:35] think like bitcoiners are really
[41:37] interesting people they are like uh
[41:39] studying and learning uh every day
[41:41] something new or they trying to get some
[41:44] something uh um a new topic um besides
[41:49] Bitcoin besides the topics we touched on
[41:51] today is there anything you're really
[41:52] passionate about uh
[41:56] currently uh
[41:59] barbecuing I bought myself a a kamato CH
[42:03] a smoker which is like this gigantic
[42:06] Beast I don't know if you have seen
[42:07] these things they look like a big red
[42:10] egg and you can cook everything on it
[42:14] from your steak to your roast to your
[42:19] brisket but you can also make pizza and
[42:22] bread and desserts and it's it's a whole
[42:25] science to look into that
[42:28] I I mean I'm currently trying to
[42:29] optimize my Stakes still early
[42:32] there but that's that's that's a that's
[42:35] a whole skill to optimize
[42:37] for H really really cool uh perfect then
[42:40] let's come to the end routine where the
[42:42] previous guest is asking a question for
[42:44] the next guest uh and it's a question
[42:46] that we a little bit touched on uh but
[42:49] maybe there's some some new thing in
[42:51] there uh is there anything that will be
[42:54] significantly different uh in this new
[42:56] bitco cycle than the last one yeah um I
[43:01] think we going to see big money trying
[43:04] to influence developers Bitcoin
[43:07] developers so we I mean we have seen I
[43:10] think they pulled back um some some ETFs
[43:14] who said they going to fund um so
[43:16] Bitcoin developers and then I think it's
[43:19] Michael sailor said don't do it maybe
[43:21] they pulled it back I'm not sure but we
[43:24] we get the urge to change something in
[43:26] Bitcoin and with money you can influence
[43:29] people and I think it will be hard to
[43:32] see whether people are driven by Passion
[43:35] and think it's the right thing to do or
[43:38] because they're driven by money and in
[43:40] the past it was definitely more the cyer
[43:43] punk movement but we are now in a stage
[43:46] where big money is being moved and big
[43:49] people are depending on this there might
[43:53] be the move of trying to change stuff
[43:56] just because they
[43:57] they have the money definitely and it's
[44:00] it's an interesting uh field to be in um
[44:03] before we end uh where can people find
[44:05] you in the best way uh and especially
[44:07] like is there anything you want to add
[44:09] to to today's
