[00:00] there are two types of bitcoiners people
[00:02] that joined Bitcoin because of number go
[00:04] up and Liars everybody came into Bitcoin
[00:07] because of number go up some of us stay
[00:09] for the right reason this has been the
[00:11] best month ever and that is a sign
[00:13] what's about to come everything against
[00:15] Bitcoin will go to zero even mcro
[00:17] strategy what do you think is the
[00:20] personal SE C set up Michael sailor
[00:22] looking like he's a smart cookie like he
[00:24] is one of the very few truly truly
[00:26] self-made billionaires he is an MIT
[00:28] educated rocket scientist and engineer
[00:31] he has been through theom bubble he must
[00:33] have a multi and there's a multivendor
[00:36] in order to pay somebody we don't need
[00:39] identity give me an address and you gave
[00:41] me that address that is enough for me
[00:43] and I will pay that address and that is
[00:44] proof that you know I paid you and then
[00:46] you can give me the goods or the service
[00:48] everything has risk like if you step out
[00:50] on the street you take a risk Bitcoin is
[00:52] the most aetric risk that you can take
[00:57] [Music]
[01:00] hi Chris how you doing everything fine
[01:01] on your
[01:02] end doing well uh every bitcoiner is
[01:06] doing well today I think yes it's it's
[01:09] the first ever episode where we are
[01:12] above 100K so like people I don't know
[01:14] will be interesting to see where we are
[01:16] in two weeks from now when this episode
[01:18] comes out and like we talking about 100K
[01:20] and it's like at 50k or at 150k let's
[01:23] see but I I feel special that you kept
[01:26] me as a reserve as the special 100K
[01:28] guest I feel really honored
[01:31] yeah it's it's interesting how it goes
[01:33] because yesterday I dropped the episode
[01:35] with yellow the guy who makes uh since
[01:38] three years and 1,100 spaces uh space
[01:42] till the 100K and yesterday dropped in
[01:45] 18 hours later we actually hit the 100K
[01:48] now he's free he's free
[01:50] finally finally he's free and today I
[01:53] released with Parker Lewis and we
[01:55] actually talked about uh what happens at
[01:58] 100K what are the psychology
[02:00] um implications of 100K and where he
[02:03] sees when the suddenly phase actually
[02:05] starts and stuff like that so perfect
[02:07] timing for my podcast but obviously I
[02:09] didn't you that uh yeah really
[02:12] interesting but what are what are your
[02:13] first thoughts of 100K what is that
[02:16] meaning for Bitcoin and and how do you
[02:19] plan to celebrate
[02:20] that so um I I would never have expected
[02:26] this to happen so quickly like I mean
[02:28] just I think one year ago like Bitcoin
[02:30] was at 25 Grand or something now we did
[02:32] a 4X in like 365 days and um two weeks
[02:37] ago or so like we recorded an episode
[02:39] for the island spage podcast where we
[02:40] were so certain it's going to happen and
[02:43] we edged very closely like I think 99,00
[02:46] or so was like the limit and we were all
[02:48] waiting and I had my my I have a red
[02:50] wine bottle KN swanholm gave me and I
[02:53] already removed like uh the the plastic
[02:55] film on top was ready to put the to take
[02:59] the cork out out and yeah it took
[03:01] another two weeks or so until we finally
[03:05] yeah tore down that wall I mean there
[03:07] was a thousand Bitcoin or so like at
[03:09] this it's a special number I don't care
[03:13] about the price anymore but a lot of
[03:15] people do and you see now the Legacy
[03:17] Media is like all over Bitcoin again
[03:19] which can't be bad what is what do you
[03:22] think is in general the importance of
[03:25] the Bitcoin price I know that bitcoiners
[03:28] always say like oh like we don't care
[03:29] about the Bitcoin price but then every
[03:32] time I put the Bitcoin price in the
[03:33] thumbnail more people click on it and
[03:36] and a lot of people talk about it
[03:38] especially now when it goes up it's all
[03:39] over my Twitter feed
[03:41] also and obviously normies and and no
[03:44] corers always talk about that like
[03:46] what's the actual importance of of of
[03:48] the US dollar or uh Fiat price of
[03:51] Bitcoin the exchange rate yeah so I
[03:53] think there are two types of bitcoiners
[03:56] um people that joined Bitcoin because of
[03:58] number go up and Liars like
[04:02] everybody came into Bitcoin because of
[04:04] number go up some of us stayed for the
[04:07] right reason the the freedom aspect of
[04:09] it and like the ability to store wealth
[04:13] and to have transactions across the
[04:15] globe that nobody can censor you don't
[04:17] need any permission anybody can join
[04:19] this monetary network but if we're real
[04:22] everybody like looked at it and saw the
[04:24] number Skyrocket and thought Oh I want
[04:26] to get in on that and F mode I still
[04:29] like number go up but I'm here for other
[04:31] reasons now and uh like this price
[04:35] action like this magic number of 100K is
[04:37] like probably the most difficult barrier
[04:40] for Bitcoin to break through and
[04:43] afterwards nobody knows but uh yeah
[04:47] happy that we are
[04:48] here it's interesting because I feel
[04:51] like the people that are just for number
[04:53] gr technology here are switching to
[04:55] micro strategy now the Bitcoin leverage
[04:59] play
[05:00] yeah uh I'm I'm too much ad IQ to fully
[05:04] understand it like to me it sounds like
[05:06] too good of a deal and if a deal sounds
[05:08] too good like stay away from it I I talk
[05:11] to rqu I talk to like a lot of people
[05:13] that have a deeper understanding of like
[05:15] these Financial plays that you can do if
[05:16] you're like a publicly listed company uh
[05:19] I wish uh the best of luck to them uh I
[05:22] personally uh prefer Bitcoin and cold
[05:25] storage because like coinbase and
[05:27] Fidelity where saor has his coins they
[05:30] can be captured it's like not it's not
[05:31] their coin like they there's this huge
[05:34] amount of trust a thousand things can go
[05:36] wrong the same can go wrong if you're
[05:38] like in self- custody but yeah I'm yeah
[05:41] micro strategy like I don't know not my
[05:45] cup of tea it's it's like you get a
[05:48] little bit more upside or this year a
[05:50] lot more upside but usually a little bit
[05:52] more upside uh but you completely lose
[05:55] out on all the freedom aspects of
[05:58] Bitcoin you don't have control over
[06:00] anything because it's not only that
[06:02] micro strategy might be confiscated or
[06:05] anything happens with micro strategy but
[06:07] you also all only hold the um IOU of
[06:10] micro strategy it's like stock portfolio
[06:13] you don't have custody of micro strategy
[06:15] if they have an IOU to a custodian you
[06:17] have an IOU to them and like if
[06:20] something unwinds I don't know like I I
[06:22] I've talked to people they say it's like
[06:24] a sure deal it's safe and as long as
[06:26] like people believe uh in this forward
[06:29] looking Equity like perfectly fine um
[06:32] but like yeah I mean in the western
[06:36] world most people do not yet had have a
[06:39] use for Bitcoin as a medium of exchange
[06:42] they're just looking at Bitcoin as a
[06:44] store of value as similar I mean Michael
[06:46] saor is preaching about that like only
[06:48] crazy crypto anarchists use Bitcoin and
[06:50] self custody use it as a a medium of
[06:52] exchange to pay stuff with it but like I
[06:55] agree with you you're missing out and uh
[06:58] it is a peer-to-peer
[06:59] system and uh you would want to have
[07:03] those freedoms that Bitcoin provides um
[07:07] once it's too late and like be prepared
[07:10] is my
[07:11] suggestion 100% it almost feels like
[07:15] micro strategy is in this cycle uh the
[07:18] the same distraction that altcoins were
[07:20] previously uh even though I i' I don't
[07:23] think the same way of micro and altcoins
[07:26] but it's it's like a distraction of
[07:28] Bitcoin and here it's now distraction
[07:30] from Bitcoin self- custody uh it's it's
[07:32] a maybe a fast stretch for comparison
[07:35] but I I see it definitely as a
[07:37] distraction because I see more and more
[07:39] comments of like I see the same type of
[07:42] comments like in the in the last Cycles
[07:43] I saw more of like oh why are you in
[07:45] Bitcoin when you just buy that X altcoin
[07:48] you get like a fre x uh return and then
[07:51] you can buy more Bitcoin I'm just in
[07:52] altcoins because I want more Bitcoin
[07:54] which is a absurd argument and the same
[07:56] argument I here now with micro strategy
[07:58] which is really interesting
[08:00] I can go to the park and sell crystal
[08:01] meth and make a lot of Bitcoin you know
[08:04] I can make this horrible deal and enrich
[08:07] myself sure go for it um like I'm not
[08:10] saying it's like moral morally
[08:12] apprehensible to invest like in a
[08:14] publicly listed stock or go long on
[08:15] something like if you believe in it like
[08:18] it's a free market and I believe very
[08:20] strongly uh like the free market if it
[08:23] exists like we'll sort this thing out um
[08:27] it is an a distraction I agree but it
[08:29] also does a lot of good I think for
[08:32] Bitcoin because Michael saor is very
[08:33] well spoken he's he knows how to talk he
[08:36] knows how to dance on this kind of dance
[08:38] floor and when he's on Fox News when
[08:40] he's on the trafi media um he has very
[08:44] strong very convincing arguments and
[08:46] like the right people would listen to
[08:47] him um not so much like to a guy like us
[08:51] like we're not talking to like the CEO
[08:53] of Google or something but um so there
[08:55] is an advantage that he's probably the
[08:58] biggest voice in Bitcoin for the last
[09:00] let's say 3 four years so credit where
[09:04] credit is due but uh yeah I'm I'm not
[09:08] buying that snake
[09:09] oil and and he himself says uh buy
[09:13] Bitcoin and not micro strategy he he
[09:15] himself says that multiple times in in
[09:17] interviews where he's like oh like
[09:19] Bitcoin up about it yes yes like he
[09:22] himself like sells micr strategy stock
[09:24] to enrich his own personal Bitcoin Stak
[09:26] which I hope he has like on a hardware
[09:28] signing device because like he everybody
[09:31] says oh he owns 4% of the Bitcoin yeah
[09:34] micro strategy does but the chairman
[09:35] like he has I think like 20 20,000
[09:37] Bitcoin like a measly measly amount of
[09:40] Bitcoin he owns himself but you
[09:44] know I I mean you're the quiz master so
[09:47] maybe that's an interesting question
[09:48] what do you think uh is the personal SE
[09:51] C setup of M of Michael sailor looking
[09:54] like um I mean he's a smart cookie like
[09:57] he is one of the very few truly
[09:59] self-made billionaires he is an MIT
[10:02] educated uh rocket scientist an engineer
[10:04] material scientist um he has been
[10:07] through the.com bubble um I've seen
[10:10] pictures uh with him and uh rodulfo
[10:14] Novak from coin kite so I I think like
[10:16] that he listens to him maybe like he's
[10:18] also like friendly with Jack dorsy maybe
[10:21] he has a bit key
[10:22] like he must have a multi sick like I
[10:26] really believe like you do not store
[10:29] like like tens of thousands of Bitcoin
[10:31] on a single s that would be Reckless um
[10:33] and I think like uh I would believe he
[10:36] he's done his research and uh there's a
[10:39] multi vender multi sick hopefully that
[10:41] is the best scenario maybe he's just
[10:43] like saying here uh Fidelity go go take
[10:46] care of that because I'm too busy orange
[10:49] ping the world but I don't know I mean
[10:51] with so many Bitcoin I would just take
[10:53] all the options and have like 50
[10:56] different solutions or something like
[10:57] that I don't know maybe 50 is too much
[10:58] but definitely multivendor multi with
[11:01] all the options there's so many out
[11:03] there yeah I mean if of course Michael J
[11:06] sailor you're looking right now like
[11:08] talk to me like we can set you up with a
[11:10] wizard Zine lyana time lock decaying
[11:12] multi so even if you shoot yourself in
[11:14] the foot like all you have to do is like
[11:16] wait 15 months all the money will come
[11:18] back to you like that is the
[11:20] state-ofthe-art that is the thing that
[11:21] you should be doing and yeah don't pay a
[11:24] custodian like I mean Point whatever
[11:26] percent you're paying at Fidelity is a
[11:29] lot of satoshis and you would take care
[11:31] of it for half of
[11:33] it I I wouldn't wouldn't uh yeah I would
[11:38] help him set it up I'm not a licensed
[11:40] custodian like I would uh educate him I
[11:43] would show him how to do it and then
[11:45] like be gone please like I don't want to
[11:47] have the burden to like I don't think
[11:50] you sleep well if you're taking custody
[11:52] of somebody else's Bitcoin uh in that
[11:55] kind of amount like I I can't ensure
[11:58] like 20,000 Bitcoin yeah that that's uh
[12:00] it's a great gateway to to the Bitcoin
[12:02] insurance but first uh I want to have
[12:05] one more thing because you one of the
[12:07] few guests that have been now on or are
[12:10] now on for a second time I think I've
[12:12] have done it with like 10 or 15 people
[12:14] till now um what has I think it was
[12:18] eight months ago something along those
[12:20] lines where you been on the first time
[12:22] what has been some of the the highlights
[12:24] for you what has been some some of the
[12:25] the things that you have uh seen over
[12:27] the last eight months that
[12:29] uh maybe shocked you maybe surprised you
[12:31] what what are some of the things that
[12:32] you have uh observed in Bitcoin no
[12:36] matter what uh over the last eight
[12:39] months yeah so I think in 2024 I um
[12:44] attended over 20 conferences like when
[12:46] we time of recording right now like two
[12:49] days from now I will be in Switzerland
[12:51] for another conference um I've spoken to
[12:54] like thousands of clubs uh met a lot of
[12:57] great people um one of my absolute
[13:00] highlights was the very first truly
[13:03] Bitcoin only conference in Hungary like
[13:05] this was per accident like I met uh
[13:08] Ferry like the organizer in Madera um uh
[13:13] and he said oh I have a hotel in Hungary
[13:15] and I want to do like a a Bitcoin
[13:17] conference and I want to keep it for
[13:19] plebs like you can attend for free you
[13:21] can pay for like better seating
[13:24] inclusive food or whatever but I want to
[13:25] keep it open like I want to be for the
[13:27] community like a a a place where people
[13:30] can come and get a proper education and
[13:32] for three days like it was absolutely
[13:35] wonderful there were like 300 people uh
[13:37] in this beautiful hotel uh in in Mish
[13:40] like in the border to Slovakia um and
[13:44] like they had phenomenal speakers like
[13:46] local Hungarian podcast I didn't
[13:48] understand a single word but I
[13:49] recognized all of the slides like I
[13:50] don't speak Hungarian surprising number
[13:53] of hungarians actually speak German um
[13:56] like Open Arms was also there and uh
[14:00] like they they had like it was
[14:03] beautifully planned out like there were
[14:05] people that had no idea about Bitcoin
[14:07] going in and then they learned about
[14:09] where it came from what's what its use
[14:11] case actually is how to buy Bitcoin
[14:15] properly without like all this shitcoin
[14:17] nonsense how to put it on a hardware
[14:19] signing device there were workshops
[14:21] there was like really this was like the
[14:23] perfect beginner conference like Bitcoin
[14:26] mol was like my highlight of of 20 24 I
[14:30] think fairy is great he also was already
[14:33] on the podcast and I met him in Prague
[14:35] he he's a great guy and I think he
[14:37] switched also uh do Bitcoin payments now
[14:40] in not switch but like opened for
[14:42] Bitcoin payments in in his hotel as I
[14:44] saw yeah I mean he is truly truly orange
[14:47] pill like he's he's a a bitcoiner true
[14:50] and through and uh yeah I mean I was
[14:53] surprised like I talked
[14:55] to Adam Adam from from Wasabi wed there
[14:58] like he's Hungarian and like he said
[15:00] this is probably the very first Bitcoin
[15:02] only conference there have been
[15:03] conferences in Budapest about uh crypto
[15:06] in general but uh in 2024 like I mean
[15:10] it's about time to have something like
[15:11] this and he's planning to have another
[15:13] one in his other hotel I think closer to
[15:16] the Romanian border um like beginning of
[15:18] of 2025 or so and hopefully I will be
[15:21] back there because was a beautiful like
[15:24] uh experience and amazing food like it
[15:27] was my first time in Hungary and Bitcoin
[15:30] own is interesting because it's uh
[15:32] really developed now where there's so
[15:34] much Bitcoin only the content where
[15:36] there's so much Bitcoin only uh
[15:39] directions like podcast conferences
[15:41] books and everything like that um but it
[15:44] wasn't always like that like there was a
[15:46] lot of uh distractions uh uh along the
[15:49] ways um when did it kind of change I'm
[15:53] I'm just since four years in Bitcoin and
[15:55] it seems like 2021 2022 was kind of like
[15:58] the first years where the Bitcoin only
[16:00] space really developed I have no clue
[16:02] how long you are in Bitcoin but how have
[16:04] you seen that development to a really
[16:07] strong Bitcoin only uh presence I mean
[16:10] it was much much harder early on to um
[16:14] find proper like Bitcoin only Educators
[16:18] everybody was doing everything like even
[16:20] the greatest ones like Andreas
[16:22] Antonopoulos talked about mimble wimble
[16:24] and like uh ethereum and all these other
[16:26] things I think you're right like around
[16:28] 202 20 2019 or so like it started out
[16:31] like there there were some proper toxic
[16:33] Maxis much much earlier than that but
[16:36] they didn't have like this large of a
[16:38] following and um now it is easier than
[16:41] ever to fall into the rabbit hole and do
[16:44] not uh have to touch the stove plate by
[16:47] getting tempted by like the next big
[16:49] thing to to formo out of Bitcoin or have
[16:51] like like false profits or something but
[16:55] um maybe adding on to to this notion
[16:58] from like what was of my highlights of
[17:00] this year I have to really break a lance
[17:02] for
[17:03] like the ethereum classic Dogecoin um
[17:08] what was else Bitcoin cash and also
[17:10] Bitcoin conference I attended uh in
[17:13] Frankfurt the proof of work Summit this
[17:15] year um I was invited by a true
[17:18] bitcoiner uh like Michael perenti and um
[17:22] I met amazing people there had amazing
[17:25] conversations like James and love was
[17:27] there Phil Zimmerman like this the filed
[17:29] Zimmer man attended um I talked to uh
[17:33] really smart people who do like zero
[17:35] knowledge proof whatever
[17:37] cryptography Magic on on Dogecoin and
[17:41] while I do not care the slightest bit
[17:43] about all of these things um it was very
[17:46] nice to have these conversations not
[17:49] like preaching to the choir if you go to
[17:50] a Bitcoin only conference like
[17:52] effectively you're preaching to the
[17:53] choir and you you agree with 99% of what
[17:57] those people like tell you or talk about
[17:59] and there like you can go to a let's
[18:03] call it a shitcoin conference
[18:06] like people watching now like I'm sorry
[18:08] but you know it is a a a kind
[18:10] conference um you can test your own
[18:13] ideas and you will come out stronger in
[18:15] your beliefs I think if you from time to
[18:17] time seek these kind of conversations
[18:20] with people that are actually believing
[18:23] in these other kind of um yeah
[18:25] Technologies and I believe something
[18:28] like Bitcoin cash is a very great buck
[18:31] Bounty for like Bitcoin like oh they
[18:34] have opcat activated for like I don't
[18:36] know how long uh millions of
[18:38] transactions and nothing has been rocked
[18:41] like we can test up codes or see if
[18:45] they're exploitable on other side chains
[18:47] instead of having to come up with a back
[18:49] Bounty you know let's do it live like
[18:52] let's test it there I like the idea of
[18:55] using altcoins as a test net uh for
[18:59] Bitcoin I that that's that's the that's
[19:02] I think a first time ever heard that
[19:04] like a half year ago on a podcast
[19:06] someone said it to me and I was like hey
[19:08] that's that's the first real use case I
[19:09] heard for Al
[19:11] coins yeah I mean it has been advertised
[19:14] like I mean the lightning network was
[19:15] tested on Litecoin um the like mimble
[19:19] wimble thing was like on grim and like
[19:22] uh zcash was initially like announced as
[19:25] something like oh we can do all these uh
[19:27] fancy cryptography things to keep make
[19:30] Bitcoin more private and then after a
[19:32] test we can Fork all those things in and
[19:34] like I think Bitcoin is such an enormous
[19:38] amount of wealth or stored wealth now
[19:40] like they have to be really really
[19:42] careful and slowly and discuss it at
[19:45] absurdum before we do anything with it
[19:47] like I'm I'm not an oifc uh like U
[19:51] person um I do want to see certain
[19:55] changes to bitcoin and we need to do
[19:56] certain changes because there are some
[19:58] some bugs that we are aware of that need
[20:00] to be fixed but we should do it slowly
[20:02] and yeah I mean who's paying for a
[20:04] bigger bug pouny then I don't know what
[20:06] the market cap of Bitcoin cashes but
[20:08] like it's enough for people to be
[20:11] tempted it's it's it's definitely enough
[20:13] for that uh but yeah the chart against
[20:16] Bitcoin uh is a good one since 2017 just
[20:19] straight down I don't know how
[20:21] everything against Bitcoin will go to
[20:22] zero everything I believe even micro
[20:26] strategy but I'm again too dumb to
[20:28] understand the
[20:32] yeah that's interesting because it's
[20:34] like if if you have um a like if they
[20:38] not get burned or confiscated or any
[20:41] anything like that um and you just have
[20:43] a company that has a Bitcoin balance
[20:46] sheets and on the Bitcoin balance sheet
[20:48] they can produce cash flow they should
[20:50] in theory be able to to outperform
[20:53] bitcoin because they have the
[20:55] possibility to accumulate more Bitcoin
[20:58] that's that's what he announced like he
[20:59] wants to build the first Bitcoin bank
[21:01] and I think that's smart but uh like I
[21:05] would not invest in that like maybe if
[21:06] you give me like a Bitcoin credit I
[21:08] would get a credit there but I'm not
[21:09] investing in somebody else to take care
[21:11] of my Bitcoin because that is the
[21:13] beautiful thing about Bitcoin that I
[21:14] don't want to give up everybody can do
[21:17] self custody and there is no point of
[21:20] not having like no self custody or
[21:23] something but then again I'm also like I
[21:25] invest in companies as well in ideas
[21:28] like I'm not selling everything and just
[21:29] going into Bitcoin I want to build
[21:31] something and uh yeah more power to to
[21:35] Michael saor is do you think that
[21:39] everyone will self custody obviously uh
[21:42] everyone can there has been a bunch of
[21:45] like there are so many people that had
[21:48] no clue before of self- custody they
[21:49] were not technical but now they learned
[21:51] and they got into self custody I saw a
[21:53] bunch of people even in my uh closest
[21:56] Family Circle so I know it's true that
[21:58] everyone can get in uh but the actually
[22:01] disagree
[22:02] there so theoretically everybody can but
[22:06] mathematically like with the utxo model
[22:08] it is impossible at this point of in
[22:10] time like with the current structure of
[22:13] utxos too many
[22:15] people oh yeah yeah def definitely at
[22:18] the um I think with Wicket we talked
[22:21] about that where uh what was the number
[22:24] I forgot which number he said he said
[22:26] like there's like a a number of of uh
[22:29] institutions people companies that he
[22:32] says like uh once we reach that and they
[22:34] are transacting on a very regular basis
[22:37] the the last one of that just gets out
[22:39] priced and they should be on a second
[22:41] layer or have some other solution uh and
[22:43] then there is like maybe shared utos or
[22:46] something uh some solutions around that
[22:48] uh but what I meant is just like from a
[22:51] brain perspective uh I think everyone
[22:53] can come to their can come to self
[22:56] custody uh how do you see it uh uh with
[22:59] with s custody in the future do we need
[23:01] to change Bitcoin uh the the code to
[23:05] make S custody accessible for everyone
[23:08] or is it at some point just okay for
[23:11] some people to have self custody on the
[23:13] second layer how do you see that topic
[23:16] yeah I I mean can we call it self-
[23:17] custody if it's on an abstracted layer
[23:19] like I think self- custody is like not
[23:23] with a lightning service provider is not
[23:25] with like in liquid or with a
[23:27] virtual 60 like I'm I'm not yet
[23:30] convinced that that is the way to go um
[23:33] I think it has been like tremendous
[23:35] watching how how much easier it has
[23:37] become over the years and a lot of smart
[23:40] people come up with smart solutions that
[23:42] actually work on bitcoin right now like
[23:44] I I initially mentioned like a lyana
[23:46] wallet um that to me solved the problem
[23:50] of Bitcoin inheritance um like I think
[23:54] the idea of having self- custody and
[23:56] being able to uh give give those Bitcoin
[23:59] to your heirs um they were diametrically
[24:03] opposed because there was always an
[24:04] element of trust I would have to give
[24:05] them the key now or I have to give the
[24:07] key to a notary or something like and as
[24:10] soon as more than one person could have
[24:12] access to this secret then it's not
[24:14] self- custody and it's like a a the
[24:17] Quorum of of the people that have access
[24:19] to it and some parties can rug you but
[24:22] with lyanna wallet we we suddenly have
[24:24] this time component which is perfectly
[24:26] enforced on chain and uh you can have a
[24:30] private key that you can give to your
[24:31] air you give the wet descriptor to them
[24:34] as well or to a notary and once you kick
[24:36] the bucket and after 15 months of
[24:38] inactivity they have access to the
[24:40] Bitcoin but not earlier and if you're
[24:42] still alive like every year and three
[24:45] months you just do like a self spend and
[24:47] this this time lock extends into the
[24:49] future and this is like this is
[24:51] brilliant and like this solves so much
[24:53] of of the problems or the the the things
[24:56] that I was afraid of like
[24:58] uh inheritance planning got got got way
[25:01] better with that but but back to that
[25:04] one thing where I'm like do do you think
[25:07] that in the future OG's or like people
[25:10] that I think even people that enter now
[25:13] H could act as a bank in the future
[25:16] because they're the only ones that be
[25:18] able to to have Bitcoin on self- custody
[25:20] on true self- custody maybe maybe in the
[25:23] near future uh only uh Black Rock micro
[25:26] strategy Robin you and I
[25:28] we can we can transact on main layer and
[25:31] like I don't know a few uh hundred
[25:34] million original Bitcoin Maxis can do so
[25:37] as well and then we will become like the
[25:39] Family Trust Fund to our
[25:42] Dynasty I don't know what the future
[25:44] will bring in that like I don't want to
[25:46] um like I I'm a big fan of lightning and
[25:49] ecash I think those are great solutions
[25:51] to have more privacy and better payments
[25:55] but I think the idea of Bitcoin would
[25:59] have failed if we do not solve it like
[26:02] more natively as well like this this
[26:05] thing of having peer-to-peer cash should
[26:08] not rely on like trust like with ecash
[26:12] you have this custodian that can
[26:14] theoretically even inflate you um with
[26:17] lightning there are limitations but we
[26:19] can also always make these things better
[26:22] um I'm not the person to do that I'm I'm
[26:24] looking at the the Galaxy brains out
[26:26] there um
[26:29] yeah I I don't know so right now Bitcoin
[26:32] as is is perfectly fine to serve the
[26:34] demand that it has and for the near-term
[26:37] future that is also true but I think we
[26:40] are like moving towards a bottleneck and
[26:42] I don't know what is the solution to
[26:44] that but uh the Ingenuity of smart
[26:47] Engineers or like a dire situation like
[26:50] inspires a lot of people to come up with
[26:52] solution like we've we've been there in
[26:54] history multiple times and we figured a
[26:56] way out and there's a lot lot of uh
[26:59] monetary incentive to do so so I think
[27:02] abolutely
[27:03] [Laughter]
[27:05] absolutely really cool and now come to
[27:07] let's come to the topic that I
[27:09] originally wanted to come with you
[27:11] Bitcoin Insurance um I never heard from
[27:14] anyone else except you around Bitcoin
[27:17] insurances are you the only one that
[27:19] actually does that so we started out in
[27:22] 2020 and the Very like it took a very
[27:25] long time to get a policy that design
[27:28] the policy and find an insurer to ensure
[27:31] Bitcoin and self- custody um before that
[27:34] there is bit Shure and avatars and they
[27:36] are focusing on ensuring Bitcoin mining
[27:39] equipment they're ensuring uh Bitcoin
[27:41] exchanges um they are big custodians
[27:44] like bitgo in the United States they
[27:46] would also offer Insurance on their
[27:48] wallet that is possible but this is
[27:50] always we have the keys we give you the
[27:53] insurance you have the access and then
[27:54] if you want to spend something there's
[27:55] like some video call or something
[27:57] happening or an HSM that is signing only
[27:59] to a certain white list of addresses but
[28:02] like the idea of having Bitcoin in self
[28:05] custody and having an insurance on that
[28:07] that is that is utterly new and we were
[28:09] worldwide the first to have the policy
[28:12] um to to ensure Bitcoin like we started
[28:14] with the first policy in October of
[28:17] 2023 and uh ever since then like it has
[28:20] been growing and we are directly
[28:21] embedded in uh the bitbox this with
[28:24] Hardware signing device you can click a
[28:26] button and ensure Bitcoin up to
[28:29] 100,000 starting out this was a lot more
[28:31] Bitcoin now we know we're very close to
[28:34] ensuring one Bitcoin but uh it is yeah I
[28:38] think the the best solution to have
[28:41] something on hand that in a situation
[28:44] where a phys physical threat occurs you
[28:47] are insured because you can Ure yourself
[28:49] against cyber hacking cryptography and
[28:50] all these things through like the
[28:52] Bitcoin as a property and taking all the
[28:54] proper precautions but there are
[28:57] instances where you can't protect
[28:59] yourself and in this gap of coverage
[29:02] this insurance fits in interesting um it
[29:05] fits also really nicely because bitbox
[29:07] is an official sponsor of the
[29:10] podcast we also ensure
[29:14] treer but yeah bitbox uh was the the
[29:17] very first to uh did they did a
[29:19] wonderful job to embed uh and uh
[29:23] integrate bit Insurance into into the
[29:25] bitbox app so you can not only like buy
[29:28] Bitcoin with pocket on there but you can
[29:30] also ensure it and that makes it easier
[29:33] and yeah we we ensure those Bitcoin
[29:34] without touching your private key like
[29:36] you can have full custody of that and we
[29:39] insure you against the $5 wrench attack
[29:41] for instance I partnered up with coin
[29:44] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[29:47] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[29:49] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[29:52] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[29:55] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[29:58] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[30:01] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[30:04] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[30:07] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:10] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:13] watch collections you have the date of
[30:16] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[30:19] there and of course also the block
[30:21] height and which EPO we are currently in
[30:25] I love the level of detail they put in
[30:28] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[30:30] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[30:33] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[30:35] love those watches so so much if you
[30:39] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[30:41] regular basis I'll guess you already
[30:43] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[30:46] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[30:49] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[30:51] personal recommendation for hard wallet
[30:53] is the bit box it's super secure it's
[30:56] simple to set up it's also perfect gift

[31:53] you pay a monthly fee uh and if
[31:55] something happens like uh in stealing or
[32:00] sometime of lost of the Bitcoin you can
[32:03] get your Bitcoin or the money that you
[32:06] have insured back yeah so you just
[32:09] mentioned it you can't get the Bitcoin
[32:10] back via so far only paying out in Euros
[32:13] you have to repurchase them like at the
[32:15] spot price um it was a a struggle to
[32:18] talk to insurance companies long before
[32:21] they were Bitcoin ETF and to get them to
[32:24] accept Bitcoin as something that they
[32:26] would ensure because
[32:28] like there are household insurances you
[32:30] can Ure anything like uh physical Goods
[32:33] perfectly fine they have policies to
[32:35] ensure gold bar they have policies for
[32:37] for wine like if if your seller is
[32:40] flooding and those wine bottles break
[32:42] they will pay this out without even
[32:44] knowing if those battle bottles actually
[32:45] broke or did you drink them or like gold
[32:48] bars you can steal this asset you can
[32:50] melt it down it's perfectly like forever
[32:53] gone and they would ensure that but as
[32:55] soon as you steer the conversation to
[32:56] hey are you interested in ensuring this
[32:58] asset called Bitcoin they would like
[33:00] pull back and think like is this guy
[33:02] crazy like we're not touching Bitcoin
[33:04] with a 10- foot stick um even though you
[33:07] present them with an asset that has the
[33:09] exact same risk as like a gold bar with
[33:11] the added like you can trace it back and
[33:15] forth you can follow the money you know
[33:18] exactly the amount of Bitcoin that was
[33:21] on the hardware signer during the the
[33:23] home invasion like you you have all
[33:25] these advantages in uring Bitcoin and
[33:28] now we have a a an insurer uh that
[33:31] reinsures the policy um with all the
[33:33] proper like Bing licenses and like we're
[33:36] due to expand to more European countries
[33:38] and Switzerland and United States but uh
[33:41] yeah
[33:42] Bitcoin is a hard sell but thanks to
[33:45] Larry think and the boys uh it it has
[33:47] gotten
[33:48] easier that's that's interesting yeah
[33:52] because when you think about it Bitcoin
[33:53] should be way easier to Ure than gold as
[33:56] you see like gold you can uh melt down
[33:59] you can really untraceable just like get
[34:02] somewhere out of the country I mean it's
[34:03] out of the country might be a little bit
[34:05] difficult depending on where you want to
[34:07] bring it but Bitcoin you can trace it
[34:09] you can say exactly when it was um and
[34:12] and you say the Bitcoin ETF and Larry
[34:14] think um actually made a difference for
[34:18] that product like that that that they
[34:20] are now for Bitcoin and they have the
[34:23] power again for that it made a
[34:25] difference for
[34:26] that absolutely absolutely like you're
[34:28] talking to a lot of uh people in the
[34:30] insurance business and um those those
[34:34] voices changed and like again money
[34:36] number go up that also brings a lot of
[34:39] eyes on there like people working at
[34:41] insurance companies are also just people
[34:43] and some of them uh develop like an
[34:45] interest into Bitcoin um but there were
[34:48] a few insurance companies that had a
[34:50] absolutely no signing anything order uh
[34:53] regarding Bitcoin and that has been
[34:55] lifted by some of them there's still
[34:57] some companies that don't want to deal
[34:59] with this but uh yeah I think like again
[35:02] Michael sailor and Larry think and all
[35:05] these Trad five Bros like kudos to them
[35:08] they they have played a big part and um
[35:12] yeah the the traditional world uh like
[35:16] needs to wake up to bitcoin and they
[35:18] slowly doing so yeah I hear sometimes um
[35:22] from from Bitcoin there's a lot of
[35:24] criticism against uh Bitcoin ETFs and
[35:27] against micro and against uh traditional
[35:31] Finance guys coming into the Bitcoin
[35:33] scene um but Bitcoin is for everyone
[35:37] like even if you don't like someone it
[35:38] is still for for enemies yes it is uh
[35:42] accessible to everyone um and again I I
[35:46] I think the only artificial intelligence
[35:48] that we have or ever ever will have is
[35:50] the free market and if you have an idea
[35:52] and you can execute on it and if it's a
[35:55] stupid idea you will fail uh if it's a
[35:57] great idea you will have success if you
[35:59] execute it it properly and like there
[36:02] are options for everybody and there are
[36:04] reasons to have a Bitcoin ETF like if
[36:06] I'm a pension fund I can't directly
[36:08] custody Bitcoin yet uh I will invest in
[36:11] this vehicle the alternative is not
[36:13] invest in Bitcoin at all so therefore
[36:15] there is a demand and therefore like
[36:17] these ETF exist I personally would never
[36:20] touch it I'm I'm uh yeah able to do it
[36:24] myself but uh again like to to scale
[36:28] this nent technology and Bitcoin is
[36:30] still nent because let's face it like 15
[36:33] 16 years um like there are three pillars
[36:36] to this um to to quote the the Mr shuch
[36:40] from from Avatar like there's Capital
[36:42] there's regulation and then there's
[36:44] insurance and we have tons of capital
[36:46] now regulation is starting to also
[36:49] develop All Around It Like Love it or
[36:51] hat it but regulation is is a thing that
[36:54] exists and will also exist and then
[36:56] insurance needs to happen and that's
[36:58] that's what we try to do too um because
[37:02] insurance is one of those pillars like I
[37:04] talked to a lot of Narco capitalists
[37:07] like like next week I'm also at the haek
[37:10] society Luxembourg Tria haek society and
[37:12] there's a lot of truly libertarian
[37:14] people and uh if you want to get rid of
[37:17] all the states like The Heirs to those
[37:18] nation states will be insurance
[37:21] companies that I can tell you because
[37:23] like if there's no public fire
[37:25] department uh everybody needs to have
[37:27] like a private insurance with a fire
[37:29] department provider or something like in
[37:31] the end you need insurance you need
[37:33] regulation you need uh Capital to grow
[37:36] this and we're growing this right now
[37:39] well kind of brings us to an interesting
[37:40] question where like where where is
[37:42] Bitcoin is do do you think Bitcoin is
[37:44] completely changing the financial system
[37:46] or is it then more of just another Tool
[37:50] uh which which people can can use I mean
[37:52] in Ideal World I want to have a Bitcoin
[37:55] standard but um I
[37:57] um like I've I've had too many turns
[38:01] around this globe to realize or like to
[38:03] to be in the belief that this will
[38:05] happen anytime soon like this will take
[38:07] over two generations of people like
[38:09] people that are growing up now they do
[38:11] not know a world where Bitcoin has not
[38:13] existed uh but it's like far from like
[38:16] replacing all these things Bitcoin right
[38:18] now is in this monetization stage where
[38:20] we have like a beautiful store of value
[38:23] and it's becoming more and more also a
[38:25] medium of exchange like I I have been
[38:27] using Bitcoin for payment for quite some
[38:28] time because I really like like not
[38:31] having to use telegraphic transfers like
[38:33] globally like when I pay people like
[38:36] outside of the EU like uh doing that
[38:39] with like a wire transfer like actual
[38:41] wire transfers have been lost which is
[38:43] crazy like you would not think like
[38:45] during the internet era that like Banks
[38:48] sending money from One bank to another
[38:49] would lose a wi transfer but that has
[38:51] happened and with Bitcoin like this has
[38:53] been solved for me but more and more
[38:55] people will get to this stage as well
[38:57] more and more companies uh already
[38:59] accept Bitcoin um so for the foreseeable
[39:03] future will be like on the same like uh
[39:07] like two tracks um and I think most
[39:10] companies will need to to jump onto
[39:12] train that is not going to stop anytime
[39:15] soon but uh the the classic Financial
[39:18] world will will still exist yeah and and
[39:21] and having uh because I now get paid in
[39:24] in Bitcoin of most of my income actually
[39:27] and it's such an have one American
[39:30] company the sponsor of coin vigilante
[39:32] and first we wanted to figure out the
[39:35] the feat payment and then in the middle
[39:36] of the process I just like no like let's
[39:38] switch to bitcoin like that that's too
[39:40] complicated and since then it's the
[39:42] first time I tried it with them since
[39:43] them all my sponsors uh are now coming
[39:46] with with Bitcoin uh because just way
[39:49] better I mean except um uh except bitbox
[39:52] that would be also easy because it's a a
[39:54] German bank account so there it's like
[39:57] no problem but with an American company
[40:00] uh or with a Panama company I think what
[40:03] the the Bitcoin way officially has it's
[40:06] harder because the feat is like that
[40:09] it's really more expensive harder I need
[40:12] numbers from a bank that I didn't knew
[40:14] that existed like some routing numbers
[40:16] or whatever what the hell is that
[40:19] yes yeah and along the way they also
[40:23] always want to have more information
[40:25] like they want to do the full kyc thing
[40:27] like and I'm all for having to ID myself
[40:30] during things like founding a company I
[40:32] go to a notary I don't want to like if I
[40:34] do a big deal perfectly fine to show you
[40:36] my ID but like this has gotten so out of
[40:39] fan like all these institutions they
[40:41] want to do all of the full kyc like
[40:43] where you born your birth date your
[40:46] favorite salad dressing like everything
[40:48] and like they always get hacked like
[40:50] always like you see these big hacks like
[40:52] in the United States like hundreds of
[40:54] millions of social security numbers I'm
[40:57] I'm sorry like the scene in South Park
[40:59] oh I'm sorry and like this is
[41:01] irreparable damage and this does not
[41:04] have to be this way and like in order to
[41:06] pay somebody like we don't need identity
[41:09] like give me an address and you gave me
[41:11] that address that is enough for me and I
[41:13] will pay that address and that is proof
[41:14] that you know I paid you and then you
[41:16] can give me the goods or the service and
[41:19] that is the the great thing about
[41:20] Bitcoin like we found a way to pay
[41:22] people without identity and now we're
[41:25] jumping through all these hoops to put
[41:27] back identity with Ln URL and B2 and all
[41:30] these things to make it easier again
[41:32] like oh this is my B2 zap at z. send me
[41:35] some Bitcoin but like you don't need all
[41:38] this like if you want to transfer
[41:40] value and that is that is the great
[41:41] thing about Bitcoin yeah and once you
[41:44] are going the the the way of being
[41:46] completely only Bitcoin I talked with
[41:48] the founder of a PTC uh he has
[41:51] completely adopted Bitcoin uh meaning
[41:54] there is no fear payments he pays in bit
[41:57] Bitcoin and he only receives payments in
[41:59] Bitcoin then it's like oh you you don't
[42:01] need that that whole fear thing anymore
[42:03] you have a website you have Bitcoin and
[42:06] there's no need to have some root in a
[42:09] jurisdiction where you have uh some some
[42:12] some fear bank accounts some kyc
[42:14] obviously you as a person as an
[42:17] individual person you're still in a
[42:18] jurisdiction and you have to obey the
[42:20] laws but that company is completely in
[42:23] cyers space at that point yeah I mean it
[42:26] is based on reput ation whether or not I
[42:28] will pay you whether or not I will take
[42:29] your service I do not check like in
[42:32] Germany we have like uh the hles SC or
[42:34] like all these fancy things that you
[42:36] have to license for you have to pay for
[42:38] and then like if I get somebody to build
[42:41] stuff in my house like oh I need tiles
[42:43] to be placed in the bathroom like I'm
[42:46] not looking at like certificates of I I
[42:48] ask other people like do you know a guy
[42:50] who does it well and I will give him my
[42:52] business too and that is perfectly fine
[42:54] that is enough like we we don't actually
[42:57] need all of these things and that is
[42:58] like this dis intimidation with Bitcoin
[43:00] like you said like you can pull up a
[43:02] website and you can get paid and this
[43:04] can be a 12-year-old child with a great
[43:06] idea like I want to be a web designer or
[43:09] I want to cut videos like nowadays like
[43:11] a lot of YouTubers they have video
[43:12] editors that are not 16 years old and
[43:16] like in Germany you have to be 16 to get
[43:17] a bank account and this way I can
[43:19] already do work like they might need
[43:21] like uh their parents need to be okay
[43:24] with that but like they have a way to
[43:26] receive funding from a guy in Japan and
[43:28] and that is just like makes the society
[43:31] better if people can execute on their
[43:33] ideas and do not have these arbitrary
[43:35] rules that are like archaic like these
[43:37] these are old let's let's get rid of
[43:40] these yeah it's it's interesting I just
[43:42] thought when when you talked about this
[43:45] institutions um because I read today uh
[43:48] I just was I was just curious what the
[43:49] mainstream media today says about
[43:51] Bitcoin in Austria hitting the 100K and
[43:54] I was reading that article quickly it
[43:56] was not that long anyway ways H
[43:58] basically my two takeaways from that
[43:59] article Donald Trump personally pushed
[44:02] Bitcoin to 100K he he was responsible
[44:04] for that uh
[44:06] because it went up 40% since he's got
[44:10] elected so it has to be Trump right and
[44:12] the second thing is like consumer
[44:14] protection in AAR says Bitcoin is
[44:17] risky yeah I mean first off everything
[44:20] has risk like if you step out on the
[44:22] street you take a risk um Bitcoin is the
[44:26] most asymmetric risk that you can take
[44:28] like you have no idea like to quote Eric
[44:31] KAS like I do not know what kind of
[44:34] money I would leave my HS if it
[44:36] dependent on like some guy unelected in
[44:39] the Central Bank like setting like some
[44:42] arbitrary number because he thinks he
[44:43] knows best like 50 years from now I
[44:46] don't know what the inflation rate has
[44:48] been during that time I can tell you for
[44:50] sure my purchasing power in Euro or any
[44:53] fat will be less with Bitcoin we know we
[44:56] know we know theoretically we could
[44:58] change it if like all people agreed we
[45:00] could change the absolute like limits of
[45:03] 21 million we could do that but like
[45:06] that is the one thing I will guarantee
[45:08] you will never have like rough consensus
[45:10] or any consensus of doing because we
[45:13] know like there will only be this amount
[45:15] of Bitcoin in the future and I see like
[45:18] this is the emission schedule like
[45:21] nobody is like inflating Bitcoin to a
[45:23] surprising number like I know when I
[45:25] stack what is it 10 million Satoshi uh
[45:29] that is the Block robort in in 20 years
[45:32] and at that time everybody and their mom
[45:35] will fight for hash right to find that
[45:37] block and I can buy whatever what is it
[45:40] right now 10 minutes satosi it's €10,000
[45:42] I can buy that now like the equivalent
[45:44] of what is it currently like 300
[45:47] $400,000 per per block reward that is
[45:50] something that helps me plan and then I
[45:53] can focus on being a good engineer or
[45:55] being a good insurance provider or that
[45:58] what I actually want to be good at and
[46:00] not having to be like a stupid investor
[46:01] at the side like so it's not
[46:05] risky it's it's the least amount of risk
[46:07] that you can take especially if you're
[46:08] young yeah it's it's the the ignorance
[46:13] of mainstream media sometimes uh hurts
[46:15] my soul but in the same time I'm like
[46:18] yeah nobody listens to them anyways uh
[46:20] oh you you you would be
[46:22] surprised there's a lot of people that
[46:25] still you know uh like I mean not
[46:28] everything that is written there is
[46:29] wrong or idiotic but um like is what is
[46:33] it called this this Gil man
[46:36] um Paradox where you where you read
[46:38] something in a newspaper that is your
[46:40] specialty and then you realize oh this
[46:42] is this is and then you turn
[46:43] the page and read something that is not
[46:45] your specialty and then you believe
[46:46] everything that is written there and
[46:49] once you come to realization like maybe
[46:51] like there's also some in there
[46:53] like you can have different sources like
[46:56] and and you just build your own picture
[46:58] of like the situation from like
[47:00] different sources and I I think if
[47:01] you're a bitcoiner you're generally more
[47:04] well informed but I've also met
[47:07] bitcoiners with some crazy opinions so
[47:09] we do not have the
[47:11] yeah we may not perfectly without fault
[47:15] but
[47:16] yeah I think my podcast is kind of the
[47:19] collection of of over 350 Bitcoin is now
[47:22] in one year and there are some crazy
[47:23] opinions in there I have to say
[47:28] you can tell me what is what is my crazy
[47:30] opinion that you talk about behind my
[47:32] back done
[47:34] recording I I I plan to do uh before
[47:38] Christmas like a few days before
[47:39] Christmas an an year end review uh with
[47:42] like uh the top 10 uh clips that YouTube
[47:47] provides me because YouTube gives me
[47:49] what are the top 10 episodes and from
[47:50] that I can see what people watch the
[47:52] most and stuff like that uh so that will
[47:55] be be fun and maybe I put in some uh I
[47:57] don't know my my personal five funniest
[48:01] moments in the podcast where like or the
[48:03] craziest opinions around that will be
[48:05] hard to figure out because this just
[48:07] such an huge uh library in one year but
[48:10] uh is really really impressive what what
[48:12] you have done like in such a short
[48:14] amount of time is very very impressive
[48:16] like and anybody who gets to have a
[48:19] Bitcoin job like that is that is just
[48:22] amazing I'm I'm amazed yeah I I was
[48:25] prepared to uh pay from my Bitcoin
[48:28] savings one and a half years my own
[48:30] salary and I never had to touch Bitcoin
[48:33] which completely surprised me because I
[48:35] just pushed every day like 70 hours per
[48:38] week and try to do my best to get that
[48:41] started with some fail project in the
[48:42] starting but it somehow it somehow got
[48:45] to be and yeah I will I will talk a
[48:47] little bit more about that in the in the
[48:49] year end review looking really looking
[48:51] forward to that perfect yeah um but one
[48:53] thing that I'm really interesting also
[48:55] uh news in general because we have now
[48:58] Twitter we we Rite uh now coming to
[49:01] Nostra even though a small amount of
[49:03] people actually use it even though even
[49:06] in the Bitcoin Community only a small
[49:07] amount of of people actually use it uh
[49:10] Are We Now moving kind of to that
[49:13] primary source uh individual journalism
[49:17] uh phase where we don't have the the
[49:19] newspaper anymore uh and we kind of
[49:21] follow the individuals that uh we we
[49:24] like best or let's say I think in in the
[49:29] in in the presidential election was also
[49:31] interesting where uh Donald Trump chose
[49:33] to be on extremely a lot of uh podcasts
[49:37] versus this was not the case before uh
[49:41] the in other elections too much um where
[49:45] I think the most interesting comment on
[49:47] under the CH Rog Donald Trump interview
[49:49] was like that's the official moment
[49:51] where a podcast got more power than the
[49:55] mainstream media with Joe r
[49:57] um how do you see the the shift to X
[50:01] YouTube podcasting versus the mainstream
[50:04] Media or is that changing
[50:06] anything yeah I mean to to play Devil's
[50:09] Advocate like we can also move in a
[50:11] idiocracy kind of future like
[50:14] theoretically like not uh just because
[50:17] you have a microphone and an audience
[50:20] does not give you like uh like you don't
[50:22] have to be right like you can spoo them
[50:24] like the Legacy Media as we know it is
[50:27] dead like this this entire model um is
[50:30] is is broken but like with
[50:33] Noster there might be a way where people
[50:36] can do these micro payments like this is
[50:39] the thing that like the traditional like
[50:42] big newspapers never really understood
[50:45] like they always wanted to sell you like
[50:47] a Subs subscription for like several
[50:49] weeks and like this barrier to entry you
[50:51] have to decide or do I pay 50 bucks or I
[50:54] pay 10 bucks or like even if it's like I
[50:55] don't know two per article like this was
[50:58] too much for some people and like with
[51:00] Noster where you can have like really
[51:03] tiny tiny micro payments and these
[51:05] amount to a lot of money like I I see
[51:07] like people posting long form content on
[51:10] there or like stacka news and they get
[51:12] paid for it I don't know if it's like
[51:14] enough to live of that but if more
[51:15] people do this and like micro payments
[51:18] actually work with Bitcoin as opposed to
[51:21] like this very famous Nix Sabo paper
[51:23] that said oh microp payments will never
[51:24] work I think they work and they are a
[51:26] very big like piece of the puzzle to get
[51:30] better information I think then again
[51:33] you should not also only listen to
[51:35] people that you like like to have a
[51:37] fully formed opinion like in Germany we
[51:39] have like the tats like the most left
[51:41] leaning newspaper there is and then like
[51:43] on the what is on the right side
[51:45] like like there's some other
[51:47] Publications and I think like uh
[51:50] conservative people should read this one
[51:52] and the Lefty should read this and like
[51:54] challenge their ideas and you should
[51:56] also um tip people um or like pay for
[52:00] for stuff that people put out that might
[52:03] be An Inconvenient Truth that is like
[52:05] something that's yeah is not aligning
[52:07] with your world but is still holding
[52:09] truth and yeah with with Bitcoin I think
[52:12] there is like uh a way to to have better
[52:15] information in that regard and it will
[52:17] be yeah podcasters definitely have a a
[52:20] much much larger more important audience
[52:22] Donald Trump understood that and um yeah
[52:26] I I
[52:27] I I'm here for it yeah it's interesting
[52:31] the echo chamber of social media that's
[52:33] true because with the absolutely an
[52:38] Eber absolutely but let me let me say
[52:41] one thing about Noster Noster does not
[52:43] have to be a social media clone like I
[52:46] use Noster to to cross poost all my
[52:48] memes that I make like I I enjoy it and
[52:50] then I see oh this meme made four or
[52:53] five on nosta and made zero on Instagram
[52:55] and Twitter this is this is great but
[52:57] Noster essentially is also a a a
[53:00] liberating medium where we do not rely
[53:03] on DNS like DNS servers that are a
[53:05] centralizing thing with nosta we can not
[53:09] just have private messages but we can
[53:11] exchange information or we can be it's
[53:14] similar to DNS you can have uh servers
[53:17] that respond to this nosta wallet
[53:19] connect all these all these things like
[53:21] there's a a a Bitcoin multisig wallet
[53:23] called Bitcoin safe it is written by a
[53:25] guy from Germany a former Spectre
[53:28] desktop developer and um he
[53:32] just very briefly implemented a an
[53:35] amazing feature based on Noster that you
[53:38] can when you set up your uh multisig
[53:40] wallet um you can uh store the output
[53:43] descriptor and synchronize that across
[53:46] Noster and when you do a a co-signing
[53:49] event where you have to have like a
[53:50] transaction signed by two of three
[53:52] people instead of like copying the psbt
[53:55] or like text messaging or sending files
[53:57] on like sneaker net you can do this over
[54:00] an encryptor I think nip 17 Noster DM
[54:03] within this wallet and this is just like
[54:06] blows my mind like that is so and he
[54:08] said it was really really easily
[54:10] implemented and you can treat nosta
[54:12] identities like these insects as single
[54:15] use you don't have to like have to tie
[54:17] to an idea like you you can use them
[54:19] once and then you never use them again
[54:22] and you can synchronize your labels of
[54:25] your utxo over no
[54:27] so and that is like I don't
[54:29] know there's so many things built on
[54:31] nosta that we we have not even scratched
[54:33] the surface and uh it does not have to
[54:36] be exclusively like a a social media
[54:38] clone is it maybe more broadly just an
[54:41] information new information
[54:44] protocol yeah I mean it is uh an
[54:48] information protocol like it is a a
[54:50] digital like IDE like just having a
[54:53] private and a public key and what you
[54:55] want to do with it
[54:57] like it is notes and other stuff
[54:59] transmitted by relays like they you only
[55:02] need a certain number of relays to reach
[55:04] like the boundary of this network like
[55:06] it is like I don't think the ultimate
[55:10] solution is to be hosting like videos
[55:13] and and like image files something like
[55:15] this this is great if it's like more
[55:17] centralized but to have the option to
[55:20] have like controversial content or
[55:22] something published across a network
[55:24] like this uh it is great and then
[55:27] everybody can can choose their window of
[55:29] censorship like you are much much more
[55:32] free and censorship can be like
[55:34] something uh like just an algorithm that
[55:36] only feeds you certain things that make
[55:39] you happy or angry or whatever which
[55:40] definitely happens on like meta or
[55:42] Twitter on all these other platforms and
[55:44] like with with these kind of things like
[55:47] you have your identity you can take it
[55:49] anywhere and you can choose what kind of
[55:52] content you want to see absolutely and
[55:54] that's where where we get freedom
[55:57] because Freedom comes from optionality
[55:59] and and having the option of having
[56:02] Nostra having Twitter having uh LinkedIn
[56:05] it's kind of like a spectrum of like
[56:06] LinkedIn then like Facebook Instagram
[56:09] comes in there then it's Twitter a
[56:10] little bit more free than have Noster on
[56:12] the other side so uh it's it's good to
[56:15] to have the option to to be on the
[56:17] platform you really want uh and yeah
[56:20] definitely Noster has really interesting
[56:22] applications there's a guy El Saad who
[56:24] even connects it to to the medical
[56:27] system there and and works with with
[56:29] hospitals uh so the people own their own
[56:33] data on Nostra and can choose to give it
[56:36] to the hospitals and the doctors they
[56:37] want to uh really interested also in in
[56:40] how this pans
[56:42] out brilliant I mean yeah I
[56:45] mean life is your oyster like you can
[56:48] now is the time to build like if there
[56:50] are young listeners that are thinking
[56:52] about what kind of future career um uh
[56:56] like build on bitcoin build on Noster
[56:59] and uh like you will not be hungry like
[57:01] there for every line of code you can
[57:03] write for NOA I think somebody will pay
[57:06] you one Satoshi like at
[57:10] least let's let's let's make the first
[57:12] seat round with two
[57:15] satosi which is also interesting because
[57:18] uh you just told me before the you have
[57:21] cedor uh the company uh and you just had
[57:24] said me that there's no more do
[57:26] available so you're basically completely
[57:28] booked with with your uh uh not devices
[57:33] how steel wall like these kind of things
[57:37] like uh everything that is behind me
[57:39] there is already spoken for um like that
[57:42] is true Alpha like uh I could foresee
[57:46] like this price pump like weeks ahead
[57:48] like the same thing happened last year
[57:50] around October November and then in
[57:52] March we at the alltime High um like I
[57:55] see
[57:56] steel water sales rising and that is so
[57:59] bullish and then I talked to my friends
[58:00] in the hardware signing business and
[58:02] they they just agree yeah this has been
[58:04] the best month ever and that is just
[58:06] like a sign what's about to come because
[58:09] when people are willing to pay for like
[58:11] a premium product like this and are
[58:13] interested in self- custody uh they are
[58:15] talking about taking Bitcoin from
[58:17] exchanges and the more and you see this
[58:20] this rate is declining there's like I
[58:21] think 2 million Bitcoin left um and it's
[58:25] ever ever steadily declining Ling like
[58:26] the sooner this goes to zero it won't
[58:28] ever go to zero but it will become much
[58:32] more apparent what the actual true price
[58:33] of Bitcoin is because um when Michael
[58:36] sailor buys Bitcoin for $40 billion doar
[58:38] and the price does not move like some
[58:41] some shady stuff going
[58:43] on so so cedo is kind of like steel
[58:47] wallets are kind of a a sign of of where
[58:50] to go like do do you see that that being
[58:53] an indicator of of a future price
[58:55] movement that again I I used to trade
[58:58] like I used to trade all these different
[59:00]  in altcoins um and would have given
[59:03] a lot for this kind of alpha or for this
[59:05] kind of you know Market sentiment like
[59:07] this is a beautiful barometer like
[59:09] there's this uh I think McDonald's thing
[59:11] like depending on how many McDonald's uh
[59:15] places are in a country that is an
[59:16] indicator of how free they are because
[59:18] like North Korea has a very limited
[59:21] number of McDonald's than the United
[59:23] States and I think like uh steel wallets
[59:27] like the most primitive let's call it
[59:29] dumbest technology like hitting a hammer
[59:33] and embossing like private seeds private
[59:36] Keys uh that is like that is basic like
[59:39] there are people that have Bitcoin there
[59:41] are people that have it in have custody
[59:42] they have people that have it on a
[59:44] hardware signing device there people
[59:45] that have their backup on paper they
[59:47] have it on something from the hardware
[59:49] store there's like so many different
[59:51] other companies and I can only see
[59:53] what's happening in our store and like
[59:56] uh just like Black Friday Cyber Monday
[59:58] weekend like thousands of devices go
[60:00] over the counter and you just think like
[60:02] I was not ready for this like this the
[60:04] third time uh that I experiened this
[60:06] before like Christmas and every time I
[60:09] think on next year you will be ready and
[60:10] we'll be better prepared and you do
[60:12] better Supply Chain management and you
[60:13] will be more in stock and
[60:15] then same again but the numbers are
[60:20] bigger interesting I love how integrated
[60:23] McDonald's is in indexes and and numbers
[60:26] like the Big Mac index and there like a
[60:28] bunch of other things with
[60:30] McDonald's yeah I mean it's a very
[60:33] strong brand but I think Bitcoin is a
[60:35] bigger brand than the golden arches now
[60:38] absolutely yeah McDonald is just like it
[60:41] was my first ever investment in stocks
[60:43] so it it was it has some sentiment to
[60:46] me okay I don't even know what my first
[60:50] stock was I think it was like tusen crop
[60:53] it was actually like a Steel stock which
[60:55] is kind of ironic
[60:58] retrospectively nice yeah I I don't even
[61:01] like
[61:02] McDonald's but back then I I liked it
[61:05] and and when I uh when my stock broker
[61:09] finally opened uh I got the message when
[61:13] I was sitting at a McDonald's so I was
[61:15] like hey I have now 500 EUR in there
[61:18] let's just invest in in McDonald's what
[61:20] can go wrong so that was my Basics basic
[61:23] decision tree of buying McDonald's uh at
[61:26] like 18 years
[61:27] old well we we got to start somewhere
[61:30] but yeah that's also beautiful about
[61:33] Bitcoin like you can trade it
[61:36] 247 no downtime absolutely really cool
[61:40] yeah perfect then thank you so much
[61:42] already we have one question at the end
[61:44] of the podcast is always the same
[61:46] question for each guest uh I think the F
[61:49] the first time we did it we didn't had
[61:51] that routine I'm not sure but question
[61:53] first like the previous guest asked me a
[61:55] question and I have to ask the next
[61:57] guest something I think yeah yes we
[61:59] still have that uh but before there's
[62:01] one question before that that I now ask
[62:04] all the time is what can we learn from
[62:06] you besides Bitcoin to get something
[62:08] outside of Bitcoin also in the podcast
[62:11] um so I think the only
[62:13] truly special topic that I'm very well
[62:17] versed and actually teach people about
[62:20] might come as a surprise to you is not
[62:22] Bitcoin but mology like I'm very very
[62:25] like deep into mushrooms and I'm not
[62:27] talking about like psychedelic mushrooms
[62:30] or anything that you know like gets you
[62:32] high but like the um we call them ktop
[62:35] Miki like the ones that are culinary uh
[62:38] in use so I can go uh during the seasons
[62:42] that we have here in Europe into the
[62:44] forest with you and I can show you what
[62:46] you can eat and what you can't and I can
[62:49] tell you uh the names of those mushrooms
[62:51] in like German English French and Latin
[62:56] that is that is one of those uh not
[62:59] useless skills but uh yeah might come in
[63:03] handy depending on you know how things
[63:04] go uh I I will survive during the
[63:08] mushroom Seasons uh in the
[63:11] woods that's great and my grandma also
[63:15] uh has that skill and and I loved it
[63:18] because she always went in the woods and
[63:20] brought those really good things back
[63:22] and it was a delicious lunch always it
[63:24] is perfect I think Bitcoin A Pas time
[63:26] like foraging for mushrooms it is uh
[63:30] like it slows you down it is very
[63:32] Thrifty and Frugal um they are healthy
[63:35] like it's a good source of protein and
[63:37] there's good stuff in there and yeah
[63:40] you're you're self-sufficient you're
[63:41] Sovereign you can actually like live of
[63:45] that so I think more more people should
[63:47] you know uh get into
[63:50] foraging absolutely but now the end
[63:52] routine that you that you know about
[63:54] where the previous guest is ask question
[63:56] for the next guest without knowing who
[63:57] the next guest is is uh and this is kind
[64:00] of very fitting one what's your because
[64:03] you're the quiz Master what's your
[64:05] favorite Hardware wallet and why and
[64:08] maybe we can spice that question a
[64:10] little bit up for you um what are the
[64:14] what are your three favorite Hardware
[64:15] wallets um and maybe you can put those
[64:18] three things for different types of
[64:20] people for beginners uh like people that
[64:24] just come in for maybe people that have
[64:25] a little bit more money in there people
[64:27] that are more advanced uh things like
[64:29] that okay uh I'm I'm wearing the shirt
[64:31] right now what does it tell
[64:34] you can you you recognize it oh I don't
[64:38] recognize it no what is that okay I have
[64:41] to have to check so my all-time favorite
[64:44] Hardware signer it is a very obscure one
[64:47] probably to most people is this one this
[64:50] is the uh Spectre DIY Shield Edition and
[64:54] it is I'm an old person I like to touch
[64:58] has a big screen you can do anything um
[65:01] like it is state-ofthe-art like you can
[65:04] do tap script multi signature you can do
[65:07] all of these things and you can easily
[65:10] restore different seeds because the
[65:12] shield Edition has something called
[65:14] smart cards I can put a Java card in
[65:16] here and that is a removal secure
[65:18] element and I can have different kind of
[65:20] seats on different Java cards and it is
[65:24] absolutely wonderful and I absolutely
[65:26] love it not a lot of people know about
[65:28] it it is kind of pricey even if you
[65:29] build it yourself but there are places
[65:31] where you can get it prebuilt or you can
[65:33] build it yourself from off the-shelf
[65:35] components and it's really a secure
[65:37] device um then the bitbox it's it's just
[65:40] a great Hardware CER all around it's
[65:42] beautifully designed it is very
[65:44] intuitive it is the one that I probably
[65:46] recommended to most people and I've sold
[65:49] hundreds of them um and also really like
[65:53] all of the features that you would need
[65:55] in Modern Hardware signing device it
[65:57] already has that and of course they have
[65:59] the insurance integrated but I was a fan
[66:02] long before for before they did that and
[66:05] yeah in third
[66:07] place yeah I would have to say uh like
[66:11] tresa treesa save 5 right now is a
[66:13] really really great Hardware signing
[66:16] device like they have a Bitcoin only
[66:17] Edition now um that is important to me
[66:20] like I don't want to have like this
[66:22] large attack surface with like all these
[66:24] different uh like codes that they have
[66:26] to maintain for like supporting other
[66:29] other currencies I fully understand why
[66:31] bitbox and Tre they do this because they
[66:33] run a company they have like Mouse to
[66:35] feed and like Bitcoin only up until very
[66:38] recently was not that um yeah profitable
[66:41] I would assume that's why they support
[66:43] all these different kind of coins but
[66:45] the trer sa 5 um has a secure element
[66:48] has a a good screen um has a very good
[66:52] um like software accompanying to it and
[66:54] it's fully open source
[66:56] so and yeah I do the German translation
[66:59] of the treasure
[67:02] Suite
[67:03] so yeah really cool thank you so much

[67:47] week uh I'm not sure when this will drop
[67:49] will this drop before the 13th of
[67:52] December could be could be uh around
[67:55] that time actually because on the 13th
[67:57] of December I will fly to Austria to
[67:59] grads uh and with coinfinity I will do a
[68:03] special uh uh who wants to be Satoshi
[68:05] millionaire quiz show and will be live
[68:07] and people can participate uh Niko ych
[68:10] will be the contestant and I will ask
[68:12] him 21 Bitcoin questions and everybody
[68:15] at home can play along live as well and
[68:18] there will be a ton of prizes and yeah
[68:20] this is the 13th uh Friday the 13th and
[68:24] uh yeah 8:00
[68:26] uh in the evening Central European Time
[68:29] really really really cool
[68:31] yeah have hard questions for Nico he
[68:34] needs them I I I told him like uh I will
[68:39] ask him Nico questions like we did this
[68:41] before with Mark frish and he really
[68:43] really surprised me like he got 18 I
[68:46] think from 21 questions correct even
[68:48] though they were very hard questions
[68:49] towards the end um and but he will have
[68:52] a phone Joker he will have an audience
[68:54] Joker and it won't be I will not make it
[68:58] easy for him not like the celebrity Who
[69:00] Wants To Be A Millionaire no this is
[69:02] going to be a an
[69:03] educational uh also fun quiz and uh we
[69:07] will test Nico's knowledge and I hope
[69:10] people turn in and hopefully this this
[69:11] episode drops before that so people
[69:13] don't know what they missed perfect and
[69:16] I will make sure that it drops uh before
[69:18] that if if it's not the normal schedule
[69:20] I will just move it up a little bit uh
[69:23] as as I'm the soul so of that podcast I
[69:27] can make that it's very
[69:29] centralized it's a very centralized but
[69:33] uh I have I don't know if you can call
[69:35] it open sourced uh because I gave away
[69:39] and I said it in multiple podcasts and I
[69:41] made it also the switch on the YouTube
[69:43] license everyone can use whatever video
[69:46] they want to cut out of here uh for
[69:49] whatever reason they they want to use it
[69:51] um and they can just take it I don't
[69:54] take ownership of my podcast in that way
[69:58] because I think uh if if uh if any if
[70:03] someone owns the video it should be my
[70:05] guest and not me because the guest is
[70:07] usually speaking and the guest is
[70:08] usually the one that that gives most
[70:11] insights uh and uh therefore like yeah
[70:14] if if you want to clip my podcast if you
[70:15] want to take something if you trying to
[70:17] copy it and upload it somewhere else
[70:19] like go ahead do it it's it's free
[70:22] marketing for me anyways we have nothing
[70:24] to hide and but I don't think like many
[70:26] people will pay for video of me
[70:28] [Laughter]
[70:32] but GIS uh how how the only fans
[70:36] account yeah I had one and people paid
[70:39] me to put my clothes back on like they
[70:41] they just didn't want to do that
[70:43] anymore very lucrative for a brief
[70:45] second
[70:46] there really really cool perfect thank
[70:49] you so much Chris for being on also
[70:51] thank you so much for everyone that is
[70:52] watching and listening for joining us uh
[70:54] today as always Al back tomorrow with
[70:56] another episode bye-bye
