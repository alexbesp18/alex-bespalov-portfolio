[00:00] and I see it much more as generational
[00:02] wealth now there's the Arbitrage of like
[00:03] almost no one gets it to the majority of
[00:05] the world will get it I got rid of all
[00:07] of them converted every coin I had into
[00:09] Bitcoin so I'm 100% in Bitcoin now there
[00:12] is nothing else it is the currency of
[00:14] the internet this is a train that I need
[00:16] to be on for my life my children's life
[00:19] my family my future generation we need
[00:21] money to be linked to actual value I'm a
[00:24] definite hodler and no intention of
[00:26] selling whatever happens to the price
[00:28] it's about protecting my personal wealth
[00:30] and my family's wealth as we get older
[00:32] making sure my children can buy a house
[00:34] hopefully one
[00:35] [Music]
[00:39] day you lived through the digitalization
[00:44] of music so from physical music to the
[00:46] digital music I thought like that could
[00:48] be an interesting starting point because
[00:50] we kind of live through uh digital like
[00:54] digitalization of gold because a lot of
[00:57] people call Bitcoin a digital gold so I
[00:58] think like there's something similar
[01:00] happening even though Bitcoin is quite
[01:03] different to to gold in a lot of aspects
[01:05] but the fundamentals are actually quite
[01:08] similar um but before before we start
[01:10] into that um how did you experience that
[01:14] shift from physical music the digital
[01:16] music maybe also with the internet
[01:18] adoption and that because you lived
[01:20] actually through that and I only hear it
[01:23] from from people telling me about it
[01:26] yeah so it was uh it was a really crazy
[01:29] uh period so I was running at a record
[01:31] label we were putting out um albums
[01:34] vinyl CD and digital was just this noise
[01:37] in the background and you'd release an
[01:39] album we'd sell 10,000 20,000 copies of
[01:42] CD um and then this thing nap called
[01:44] Napster started you kept hearing about
[01:47] Napster and um didn't really understand
[01:50] what it was I think it was sort of
[01:51] peer-to-peer
[01:53] essentially stealing music that was
[01:55] initially how it was it was free music
[01:57] you don't need record labels anymore and
[01:59] when you're running a record label
[02:00] that's quite a challenging thing to to
[02:02] face and initially we kind of just saw
[02:05] it sort of bubbling away in the
[02:06] background and then people that then
[02:08] what happened was there was a really
[02:10] slow decline in the sales of physical
[02:12] music and so I noticed that our album
[02:14] sales from some of our bigger artists
[02:16] would drop so you would always sell 20
[02:19] 20,000 is not very many but it's it's
[02:21] enough for an artist to live on and so
[02:23] you might sell 20,000 the first TR and
[02:25] then the next album would be 15,000 like
[02:27] is the album just not as good and it was
[02:30] all at the same time so this is kind of
[02:32] the the very um late 90s you've got
[02:35] Napster coming all these Digital
[02:37] Services coming and we suddenly saw a
[02:39] huge drop very quickly in vinyl sales so
[02:42] we would release we were selling dance
[02:44] music records put a vinyl out sell 5,000
[02:46] copies and then very quickly it went to
[02:49] selling one and a half thousand copies
[02:50] and then a th000 copies and you found
[02:53] out what the people were doing what the
[02:54] DJs and the fans were doing they were
[02:56] just stealing the music so they would
[02:59] find it on a streaming website somewhere
[03:01] and the well I don't need it I'll just
[03:03] keep a copy of it digitally and I don't
[03:05] need to buy it anymore so it had a huge
[03:08] effect on on our our business and we saw
[03:10] a massive drop in income um huge drop in
[03:13] sales to the point where it almost
[03:15] became not viable to run the record
[03:18] label anymore and I was running a small
[03:19] Independent Record label it had a huge
[03:22] impact on the big major record labels as
[03:24] well and the the staff levels dropped
[03:26] dramatically from the record labels
[03:28] they're back up now of digital but there
[03:31] was a huge layoffs all over the industry
[03:34] as people got the head around this thing
[03:36] called free music um which which was
[03:39] difficult I was also I was a director of
[03:41] the official chart company in the UK at
[03:42] the time and we were running panels with
[03:45] all of the major record labers just
[03:47] talking about how are we going to cope
[03:49] with this thing that's coming and none
[03:51] of us really could see what was going on
[03:53] there was no Spotify there was no none
[03:55] of these sort of legitimate services at
[03:57] that stage so we really lived through
[04:00] through the hard part of it and at the
[04:02] same time the internet was developing so
[04:04] you've got this perfect storm all all at
[04:06] the same time and my business the way we
[04:09] got out of it is we we were very early
[04:11] to e-commerce in music so I set up a an
[04:14] e-commerce website called records.co
[04:16] back in 1998 in fact I'd set my first
[04:19] ecommer site in 1997 for my record label
[04:23] and and what happened there was we
[04:24] didn't start selling digital music at
[04:26] all at that stage we were still selling
[04:28] physical music but we sold to a wider
[04:30] audience because instead of just selling
[04:32] to fans in Europe through record shops
[04:35] we were able to sell through our own
[04:36] website to fans all over the world and
[04:39] so that that was that shift the
[04:42] digitization of Music took a bit longer
[04:44] we did start selling digital music in
[04:46] around I think around 2000 and record St
[04:49] on my website we were the first website
[04:51] in the UK to sell physical and digital
[04:53] music together so you could buy an MP3
[04:55] and a CD and a t-shirt in one
[04:57] transaction but it was really low level
[05:00] because people why would I want to buy
[05:01] an MP3 I can just get it for free from
[05:05] Napster yeah so that was it was a very
[05:07] challenging period and and we were
[05:09] essentially saved by our e-commerce
[05:12] operation I mean I had to trim down the
[05:14] size of the business I couldn't pay the
[05:15] Artist as big advances we had to let go
[05:18] some stuff but we we managed to bounce
[05:21] through and then around 2000 we you saw
[05:24] the internet was really going to be
[05:26] something in fact one of my uh one of my
[05:29] staff brought me a book called The Death
[05:31] of distance which is worth reading if
[05:33] you ever find it and it was about the
[05:34] forthcoming Revolution called the
[05:36] internet and I read it this is probably
[05:39] 98 in fact he came to me and said we
[05:41] need a website I'm like what's a website
[05:43] what do I need a website for and he
[05:45] explained it to me and we built the
[05:46] website and then we had this website and
[05:48] I'm like great it's just a
[05:51] picture and then I said couldn't we get
[05:53] the fans to buy things from the website
[05:55] so we built a really rudimentary shop
[05:58] and that was the very beginning and then
[06:00] in the next couple of years I managed to
[06:02] sort of take the idea out to different
[06:04] people in the industry and I started
[06:05] running the e-commerce shops for bigger
[06:07] artists um starting with well very big
[06:10] artists like the Beatles the the um
[06:13] Robbie Williams Queen and that was what
[06:15] rescued us and we sort of moved away
[06:17] from being a record label into becoming
[06:19] purely an e-commerce operation and
[06:21] eventually shut the record label
[06:23] down and now it's uh like it's now it's
[06:27] not operational anymore no the record
[06:30] anymore I mean the content is still up
[06:31] on all of the streaming services but
[06:34] there's no new music coming out of it
[06:36] okay interesting yeah that that's a
[06:38] really interesting time because you
[06:40] really live through like the shift of
[06:43] something there was something existing
[06:44] all of the sudden new technology comes
[06:46] out which makes the the old thing not
[06:49] completely absolete there are still like
[06:51] collectors who enjoy like uh uh physical
[06:54] forms of Music um especially with the
[06:57] the big plates how he called I forgot
[06:59] the name
[07:00] fin Vally
[07:05] yeah yeah I I never used them so I don't
[07:08] even know the German word for it and uh
[07:10] not not not even the like I think I saw
[07:14] a record of v in my life maybe like
[07:17] three four times in my life when someone
[07:19] gifted it to someone else on Christmas I
[07:21] saw it because there was like an uncle
[07:23] of mind getting it he's like crazy about
[07:25] them uh but but usually like like like
[07:28] 99 by % of my life is like only digital
[07:31] music because I live in in this in this
[07:33] world but it's it's great that you did
[07:35] that Pioneer work kind of in the before
[07:39] 2000 even with building the website and
[07:41] and doing all it stuff what are some of
[07:43] the the learnings that you learned in
[07:45] that time that maybe is now uh
[07:48] interesting for bitcoiners and and
[07:50] people that pioneering now in the
[07:51] Bitcoin space uh relevant I mean I think
[07:55] the importance of a of a
[07:59] of complete holistic strategy for for
[08:02] Global I you've got to remember when we
[08:04] built the first website there was no
[08:05] social media Facebook didn't exist or
[08:07] may have existed in its infancy so um I
[08:12] if you're launching a Bitcoin brand
[08:14] you've got to think very much about
[08:15] website perhaps being the core of it you
[08:17] still need to build an email database
[08:19] you still need to all the what would be
[08:21] considered oldfashioned now as a way of
[08:23] expanding but it's so much broader now
[08:26] because you've got the reach of all of
[08:27] the different platforms you got think
[08:29] very much about um I think I think
[08:32] things will change you got to remember
[08:34] when we were doing it there was
[08:35] literally a couple of top level domain
[08:37] names.com or. co.uk now there's
[08:41] gazillions of them you getgaming do
[08:44] everything else so the web the web page
[08:46] was a core part of it the other thing is
[08:49] mobile didn't exist because the iPhone
[08:51] hadn't come out so we weren't building
[08:53] websites for um different screen sizes
[08:57] so you've got to think now about
[08:59] optimizing for all the you different
[09:01] user experiences where are your users
[09:04] going to be so that how can you reach
[09:05] them regardless of what platform they're
[09:07] using and that was a really interesting
[09:09] curve that we went through because all
[09:10] of our websites were designed to work on
[09:12] a u a desktop or a laptop and then in
[09:17] Mobile sort of came out of nowhere and
[09:19] you suddenly had all of your websites
[09:20] that look terrible on a mobile phone
[09:22] because you know a Mobile screen is much
[09:24] smaller and then we had to I can't what
[09:27] is it called responsive design so my
[09:29] design team then in started working with
[09:31] their skills to introduce responsive
[09:34] design on the websites where they
[09:35] resized the websites to fit mobile
[09:37] devices and then you had to work with
[09:39] the the banks to allow so our credit
[09:42] card payments were processed by a
[09:44] company called worldpay they still exist
[09:46] they one of the big guys and they their
[09:49] checkout only worked on a computer and
[09:53] suddenly where you know you you've got
[09:55] people buying through these little
[09:56] screens so I had to work with the bank
[09:59] and well paid just go you need to you
[10:01] need to allow us to let customers pay on
[10:03] a mobile phone I remember when we first
[10:05] talking to them about it they they they
[10:07] literally had no idea what I was talking
[10:09] about interesting is that uh experience
[10:12] that you made uh through the music and
[10:14] the websites and the internet adoption
[10:16] made it this easier for you to
[10:18] understand Bitcoin and and get how
[10:20] disruptive it could be yes absolutely so
[10:23] I think I've always been very
[10:25] entrepreneurial so I haven't I have had
[10:27] some time in big Corporation but most my
[10:30] career has been sort of um
[10:33] entrepreneurial and looking at what's
[10:35] coming next I mean we were very very
[10:36] early in the internet I mean if you
[10:38] think I think Amazon was around 95 and
[10:40] our first website was 97 so we were very
[10:44] early and you can see the huge
[10:46] resistance I remember I remember I uh
[10:49] when we started offering our service to
[10:51] other record labels so we did a deal
[10:54] very early on with a brand called the
[10:55] Ministry of Sound which was a big record
[10:57] label and big Club in England they got
[10:59] it quite quickly and then I would go to
[11:01] meet other record labels and explain
[11:04] what we were doing and they literally
[11:06] had no idea no comprehension a bit like
[11:08] talking to people about Bitcoin now so
[11:11] they they look at you blankly and
[11:13] they're like what do you mean you you
[11:15] you're going to sell records over over a
[11:18] computer I know it sounds so ridiculous
[11:20] now but it was such a conceptual shift
[11:23] for people and and bitcoin's bitcoin's
[11:26] the same I mean I have conversations
[11:28] with
[11:30] my friends call me a Bitcoin ball and
[11:31] they're
[11:32] like just we don't get it it's all going
[11:35] to crash it's all going to zero you're
[11:37] wasting your time I have that
[11:38] conversation so often in fact I
[11:39] generally stop talking about it now or
[11:41] though my family probably wouldn't say
[11:43] that but but yeah I I can see I can see
[11:46] it the similarities are very
[11:48] Stark I mean does that mean that's not
[11:51] the wrong word they're very similar they
[11:52] are very similar yeah it's it's super
[11:54] interesting uh but it gets more I I'm uh
[11:59] just yesterday I had a conversation a
[12:01] lovely conversation uh the boyfriend of
[12:04] my sister's uh and he has an uncle who
[12:07] was like Hey I want to invest in Bitcoin
[12:10] and they're like hey my my
[12:11] brother-in-law is like this this weird
[12:13] Bitcoin podcast that you should talk to
[12:15] him uh so I had never contact with them
[12:18] with them before because they're really
[12:19] like far out uh families and we just had
[12:23] a quick uh um Google meet call and they
[12:27] were like oh yeah we really concerned
[12:29] about the Euro and uh I don't know about
[12:31] Bitcoin I don't know about gold like but
[12:33] we're really concerned where the the
[12:35] future is with with the Euro and what's
[12:37] the future with with uh Fiat currencies
[12:40] they did not say Fiat currencies but
[12:41] they said like the Euro the the dollars
[12:43] and stuff like that uh so obviously they
[12:46] had they really had the the concern of
[12:48] of that and they were just like super
[12:51] normal uh they have normal jobs they're
[12:53] like uh almost 60 years old 55 or
[12:56] something like that so like almost like
[13:00] more and more people get it now like
[13:02] normal people not not like freaks like
[13:06] like me or something like that H get it
[13:08] now like people actually see the problem
[13:11] more and more we're like oh yeah yeah
[13:12] Euro like the purchasing power is really
[13:15] going down um we hear more and more okay
[13:18] how long will the Euro be be around it's
[13:20] it's not a good experience till now uh
[13:23] so I think I have a lot of hope that
[13:25] through the pain that the fan system
[13:27] causes that the people actually start
[13:29] slowly to to wake up at least like what
[13:31] what I see now obviously the the rising
[13:33] price and now kind of I think we are the
[13:35] starting of a major pool Market probably
[13:38] again so this this will also pay in that
[13:41] so like the the the the Stick of the fat
[13:44] currencies and the carrot of the Bitcoin
[13:47] price bring bring people there but I
[13:50] hope I'm very hopeful that more and more
[13:52] people now wake up to to that reality I
[13:55] I think they do um it is interesting
[13:57] because I'm in the age category and
[13:59] um I a lot of people in My Generation Um
[14:04] have money most of it's tied up in
[14:07] property um but they're looking at this
[14:11] you've invested in the stock market your
[14:12] whole life if you've bought a pension if
[14:14] you're lucky enough to have something
[14:15] like that and then this thing comes
[14:17] along and you see this growth and um
[14:21] I've got a lot of friends who work in
[14:22] the banking sector and
[14:24] they so far they're all dismissive of it
[14:28] I haven't had any one of them just go
[14:30] yeah we should look at this a couple of
[14:32] them have gone I'm not sure I get it um
[14:35] it just doesn't feel right but they
[14:36] haven't investigated it so I lace it
[14:40] into conversations when it feels right
[14:42] just to get people's take on it most
[14:44] people are too
[14:46] busy I don't know uh watching crappy TV
[14:49] programs worrying about their own life
[14:50] worrying about the war war and troubles
[14:53] and everything else and it kind of
[14:54] passes them by it was quite a surprise
[14:57] when I went to bitcoin Amsterdam how big
[14:59] it was I I was I was a bit taken back
[15:02] about how big the event was because I'm
[15:04] I you know walked in I'd heard it might
[15:06] be quite big to see that that huge arena
[15:08] in like three what was it 5,000 people
[15:10] something like that and you're like okay
[15:12] this is this is not a fringe thing
[15:14] anymore this is and also if you I don't
[15:16] know what you felt but you looked around
[15:18] at the people there and the age
[15:19] demographic was very wide it wasn't it
[15:22] wasn't just young kids in skateboard
[15:25] shirts it was I found it was mostly
[15:28] older people I was really surprised that
[15:29] looking at the age thinking oh yeah
[15:31] there are people my age who are here
[15:34] either already working somehow in a
[15:37] Bitcoin company or investing or looking
[15:40] into it so it's going to be interesting
[15:42] to see I I suspect there will be more
[15:45] adoption as it gets noisier I mean the
[15:49] ETFs obviously transform transformative
[15:52] when it comes to increasing the noise um
[15:55] with that generation about Bitcoin I
[15:57] have something interesting Maybe to to
[15:59] share with you um uh about uh wait let
[16:04] me quickly check can I share that yeah I
[16:06] can share that uh let's give that
[16:10] free I never shared that on the podcast
[16:14] but I think it would be interesting
[16:15] because it comes out a lot I also when
[16:17] the first time I got into Bitcoin and I
[16:20] got to a Meetup I was surprised that I'm
[16:22] the youngest guy there wow that's
[16:24] amazing I've never seen that before
[16:26] that's incredible and I have quite um I
[16:30] think a representative audience now
[16:31] because I do only Bitcoin content uh and
[16:34] I have between like 50,000 to 100,000
[16:37] monthly viewers uh so I think it's it's
[16:40] quite representative of of the space and
[16:43] as you can see here I have almost nobody
[16:45] that is under 18 and there are almost
[16:49] three times as many people over 65 than
[16:52] under 25 and I'm 26 so like I'm I'm like
[16:56] in the on the lower end of the spectrum
[16:58] and if you see it the the the average
[17:00] age is around like 40 to to 50 something
[17:04] somewhere along those
[17:06] lines so so that's that that's what you
[17:09] saw in Amsterdam I think is actually
[17:11] representative of the Bitcoin community
[17:14] and it it quite literally shocked me uh
[17:17] the first time I went to a Bitcoin
[17:19] Meetup and the second time it shocked me
[17:21] when I saw my own analytics for the
[17:22] first time yeah I mean I had no idea I
[17:26] mean you can understand from a final
[17:29] perspective most people under 24 don't
[17:31] have excess cash you know when I was 24
[17:34] I was kind of you know living paycheck
[17:38] to paycheck wasn't very well paid some I
[17:40] managed to buy a house but um that's
[17:43] when houses were a lot cheaper but um we
[17:47] yeah I mean that that demographic I
[17:49] think it's probably because people as
[17:50] they get older have invest some
[17:53] investment capabilities and Bitcoin
[17:56] becomes a a possible part of your your
[17:59] portfolio if you hear about it I mean so
[18:01] many people have never heard about it I
[18:03] mean because I don't know what you're
[18:06] like but because I spend a huge amount
[18:07] of time listening to bitcoin Paul Carson
[18:09] I become really absorbed in it this year
[18:11] in particular um and I see that many
[18:15] people literally don't know I mean I
[18:17] still get the well it's just a Ponzi
[18:18] scheme I I still get that or one of my
[18:22] friends to the other I don't care about
[18:24] getting rich I'm like it's it's a little
[18:26] bit that's not really what it's about
[18:29] so it's it's about not getting poor yeah
[18:33] yeah yeah it's about it's about you
[18:35] maintaining spending power I mean you
[18:37] know these these people who have retired
[18:39] one of my friends is retired on a really
[18:41] crappy little pension and and his
[18:43] spending power is just going to go down
[18:45] and down and down because his pension
[18:47] goes up by 3% a
[18:49] year so you can if inflation carries on
[18:52] as we know it's all way higher than the
[18:53] official figures so if if if inflation
[18:56] carries on at that 8 10% in in 10 years
[18:58] time he's really going to be
[19:00] struggling and and uh it's like Bitcoin
[19:04] is right now both Bitcoin is right now
[19:07] not getting poor uh and both also uh
[19:11] getting rich because like this getting
[19:13] rich is like the adoption curve that we
[19:15] have because like almost nobody gets
[19:17] Bitcoin and there's the Arbitrage of
[19:19] like almost no one gets it to the
[19:20] majority of the world will get it and at
[19:23] the same time the monetary Pol policy is
[19:25] that what preserves and conserves your
[19:28] financial energy that's why it's so hard
[19:30] to explain like it's it's like you have
[19:33] a Tesla stock in there but you also have
[19:35] gold in there it's like that that kind
[19:38] of two different kind of Worlds where we
[19:40] have high growth High Innovation high
[19:42] things that there's a lot of money and
[19:44] interest in people coming in but at the
[19:46] same time it's very conservative from a
[19:48] base level from where it will go so it I
[19:52] understand when people are confused to
[19:53] be honest especially if they are not
[19:55] deeply involved with it yeah totally I
[19:58] mean the the summary I give people at
[20:00] the moment is it's currently like
[20:02] digital gold you've got to think about
[20:03] it as gold as as a store of value but it
[20:06] will probably become a currency and a
[20:09] medium of exchange as well but we there
[20:12] yet it's also interesting when because
[20:15] yesterday the couple I explained them
[20:18] first like why Bitcoin and then they're
[20:19] like okay like how do we do that like
[20:21] where do I get Bitcoin and and I
[20:24] explained it to them but it's it's
[20:25] really hard to explain how how you
[20:28] custody coin uh and and and how this
[20:31] works and where the Bitcoin are and how
[20:32] you can recover them like this are all
[20:35] completely new things you cannot relate
[20:36] into anything else that they did before
[20:38] so like uh education is such a crucial
[20:41] Point that's why uh podcasting and and
[20:44] being content creator and being a
[20:46] speaker and being just an educator in
[20:48] the space is so important because we
[20:51] definitely need uh those people
[20:53] explaining to everyone we need to be
[20:56] like I had someone on the the podcast
[20:57] who just like runs around his village
[21:00] and and gets like normal people in the
[21:02] street talking about Bitcoin without
[21:04] camera just like as a normal dude it's
[21:06] it's so great we need those people
[21:08] spreading the word uh but also like the
[21:10] conent grated podcast host the speakers
[21:13] all all the entrepreneurs in the space
[21:15] to explain to the world basically what
[21:17] Bitcoin is and how how we uh keep it
[21:19] safe and how we can do with it that's
[21:21] that's so important I mean is like you
[21:23] said earlier it's incredibly similar to
[21:24] when the internet first started people
[21:26] really didn't understand I mean I didn't
[21:28] understand I I you know I know we talked
[21:31] about it earlier but when when we built
[21:33] our first website I think it cost £1,000
[21:36] and I could have released a record for
[21:37] £1,000 and I was like why did I waste
[21:40] ,000 just to have this thing on a
[21:43] computer and but very quickly you know I
[21:46] think before that when I first you need
[21:48] an email address I'm like I've got a
[21:50] phone and a fax machine why do I need an
[21:52] email you got to think that's only 25
[21:55] years ago and so that's exactly where we
[21:58] are right now people are like what and
[22:01] it is hard to explain I mean people
[22:03] think your Bitcoin is on your little
[22:06] Ledger or whatever but of course it
[22:07] isn't the Bitcoin is on the blockchain
[22:09] but you tried to explain yeah but but it
[22:13] is s such as soon as you go down the
[22:15] rabbit hole you're like oh Christ how am
[22:17] I going to explain this I really would
[22:20] love somebody I've seen so many this is
[22:22] the best description of Bitcoin ever
[22:23] videos and they're all confusing and I'm
[22:26] like there must be someone that's going
[22:28] to be able to put one together that I
[22:30] can play to my mom she gets it you know
[22:34] so but that's the that's magic actually
[22:37] of it because uh I think we we don't
[22:40] need the one description I think we need
[22:42] as many description as possible we need
[22:44] as many people explaining it to other
[22:47] people H and then because like for
[22:50] someone uh I was a stock Pro before
[22:52] Bitcoin I was like really into stocks
[22:54] and investing in companies and that's
[22:56] why Michael sailor made a lot of sense
[22:58] to me because he is used to uh talking
[23:01] to retail investors and talking to
[23:03] investors in general because he has his
[23:05] own stock and his own company uh but
[23:07] some of the other people especially like
[23:09] uh even like a Savin Mo he didn't make
[23:12] sense to me like I was like what are you
[23:14] talking now I get him now I really like
[23:16] oh man he really knows his stuff but in
[23:19] the beginning I needed the explanation
[23:21] of Michael sailor to even get me into
[23:23] Bitcoin and I think that's what I also
[23:25] try with this podcast because I have so
[23:27] many people on that have never been on a
[23:29] podcast before like around 10 to 20% of
[23:31] my guests and we have the science
[23:34] teachers on we have the other people on
[23:37] um where they're just like normal people
[23:39] who have a normal job uh and they have
[23:42] their view on bitcoin and then when
[23:43] there's like uh another teacher B
[23:46] biology teacher and listens to that
[23:48] science teacher like oh yeah it makes a
[23:50] lot of sense what he's talking but when
[23:52] that that teacher listens to Michael oh
[23:54] I cannot relate to that billionaire who
[23:57] issues convertible which I have no clue
[23:59] what this even is so I think we need as
[24:02] many voices as possible explaining and
[24:06] educating uh and I hope I can make a
[24:09] small contribution with my podcast in in
[24:11] in that and yeah it's really really fun
[24:14] to to do to be honest yeah I no I think
[24:16] you do I mean you've got amazing ring of
[24:18] guests um you know it's always always
[24:21] very varied that's what I like about
[24:22] your podcast huge variation it's not all
[24:25] the same many of the podcasts just have
[24:27] the same guests again and again and
[24:29] again and you're like okay that's you
[24:31] know and yeah you're also not the the
[24:34] other thing that's great is you're not
[24:35] selling anything I know you've got the
[24:37] adverts in the podcast but you're not
[24:38] out promoting something which is which
[24:41] is good so there's no alterior motive
[24:43] you know you are basically educating
[24:45] which is great yeah the the sponsors I
[24:47] need to to to basically also make it
[24:50] daily yeah live from that but yeah I'm
[24:54] not I don't have a company I don't have
[24:57] anything that I'm really like oh I want
[24:59] to sell this other than maybe a Bitcoin
[25:01] t-shirt that I have on
[25:03] but that's not a lot yeah um perfect but
[25:07] one thing that I actually wanted to get
[25:08] to uh when I mentioned a couple is the
[25:11] the last question they asked me was
[25:14] about oh will they ban Bitcoin and it's
[25:18] it's super interesting for me because I
[25:21] I don't ask myself this question anymore
[25:23] it's just so out of the realm for me I'm
[25:25] so deep into the space but people who
[25:28] have not in the space that's actually
[25:30] concerned about them especially now they
[25:33] saw that the European Central Bank is
[25:35] writing something negative about Bitcoin
[25:37] I don't know if they saw the the Reon
[25:39] thing that we also should talk about but
[25:42] they saw something so it's still a
[25:43] concern for people um uh do do you also
[25:47] see that and then maybe we can get into
[25:49] the what the European Central Bank wrote
[25:51] with the distribution of wealth um I
[25:54] think it exists at the back of my head
[25:56] slightly as a concern but
[25:59] because of the decentralized nature of
[26:01] it it's not in you know it isn't in one
[26:04] country it's a network it's almost like
[26:06] trying to ban the internet I think
[26:08] that's the best description when people
[26:10] say can they ban it they're like or ban
[26:12] electricity or ban wheels or ban fire
[26:15] you know it's kind of course you can't
[26:17] ban something that has this huge Network
[26:19] effect you might through your own
[26:21] technology be able to restrict access to
[26:24] it in a country like China have done um
[26:26] and some some other countries but it
[26:29] cannot be banned and
[26:32] and yeah I mean I cannot see any way
[26:36] governments are obviously terrified
[26:38] about it because it's out of their
[26:41] control but when the internet came along
[26:43] there's there's legislation and rules
[26:45] around the internet that help make it
[26:47] safe and all of this stuff which kind of
[26:49] works and maybe that's coming to bitcoin
[26:52] and perhaps that might not be a terrible
[26:54] thing because you've got a lot of the
[26:57] early Cowboys in involved there was huge
[27:00] numbers of people that have lost their
[27:01] Bitcoin been conned out of their Bitcoin
[27:03] and you can see why um it would be
[27:05] useful to have something like that in
[27:08] place but as for it being banned no as
[27:11] for the European Central bank's um most
[27:13] recent attack on it um I I I think it's
[27:17] quite interesting I've actually had some
[27:20] of those thoughts myself like I hear
[27:23] some people talking who were buying
[27:24] Bitcoin well I bought 10,000 Bitcoin
[27:26] when it was a pound and you're like or a
[27:27] dollar and I'm like okay so you have a
[27:30] massive unfair advantage over me because
[27:32] you heard about it first and the way
[27:34] I've rationalized that for me is the
[27:36] early investors in Google and Amazon and
[27:38] have exactly the same Advantage I saw a
[27:40] slide the other day if you put a
[27:42] thousand I think it was if you put
[27:43] $1,000 excuse
[27:45] me if you put $1,000 into Microsoft when
[27:49] it ipoed that's today worth 5.4 million
[27:53] I don't know if that's the correct
[27:54] figure but it's something ridiculous and
[27:56] the same with Google same with Facebook
[27:58] Facebook so the Returns on investment
[28:01] for those people who knew about these
[28:02] companies or took a risk is enormous but
[28:06] it's the same as the people who are at
[28:07] the beginning of Bitcoin they took a
[28:09] risk for a lot of these people who are
[28:11] you know the Cyber punks and the Out The
[28:13] Outsiders if they'd spent $1,000 on
[28:16] bitcoin that was a huge amount of money
[28:18] for them at the time no doubt because
[28:21] you didn't have Michael sailor and
[28:22] people like that investing at the start
[28:25] so yeah I think the sorry two answers
[28:29] they the the European Central Bank paper
[28:30] was about the unfairness and a transfer
[28:33] of wealth to
[28:34] the original bitcoiners but I think
[28:37] they're missing a trick it's just you
[28:39] got to think about it in terms of its
[28:42] investment return like an early
[28:43] investment in a company except the
[28:45] company doesn't have a CEO and no one
[28:47] can mess around with it so it's almost
[28:50] like an early investment into an
[28:52] infrastructure you you an early investor
[28:54] into um the network or Cisco or one of
[28:58] the roters in the in the internet is it
[29:00] unfair that you did that because you
[29:01] knew about it I don't think so I think
[29:03] they're just worried I think they're
[29:05] worried about losing power and if they
[29:07] don't control the issuance of the of the
[29:10] money you know and I never knew any of
[29:12] this stuff until this year I didn't
[29:15] understand money until I read broken
[29:16] money and you're like oh
[29:19] wow that's on ECB I partnered up with
[29:23] coin vigilante this is the most

[31:33] yeah it's super interesting that debate
[31:35] uh especially with um early Bitcoin OG's
[31:38] early Bitcoin harders um I think most
[31:42] like I think there's some things that we
[31:44] even like have to clarify most of the
[31:47] people who bought Bitcoin in 2010 11 12
[31:50] 13 15 they have lost their coins in
[31:53] either an exchange going bankrupt or
[31:56] exchange just stealing them or they they
[31:59] did not take Bitcoin seriously so they
[32:01] lost the hardware uh device they lost
[32:04] their laptop where the Bitcoin were on
[32:06] so like uh most of them like just like
[32:09] mistakenly misplaced them because they
[32:11] sold Bitcoin for 20 euros and all of the
[32:14] sudden it's like a few hundred thousand
[32:17] or million even so they didn't know
[32:19] about the value necessarily which
[32:21] Bitcoin will have so they they of course
[32:24] lost them then the second thing is even
[32:27] if they actually managed to hold them
[32:30] through exchanges crisis or other things
[32:33] they sold the
[32:35] coins like you have imagine like if you
[32:37] invest a thousand Euros in 20 I don't
[32:39] know 12 in Bitcoin and you see your your
[32:42] net worth rising up to 10,000 100,000
[32:45] 500,000 at some point you're like oh
[32:47] [ __ ] like I can buy a lot of
[32:49] things with that and then the third
[32:52] thing even if like they never sold they
[32:54] never lost it they took a massive risk
[32:58] uh there was a like a massive
[32:59] uncertainty in Bitcoin it's not like now
[33:02] there are a lot of Bitcoin podcasts
[33:03] there's like a Michael sailor out there
[33:05] there's a NE act all those big people
[33:07] defending Bitcoin it was it was the wild
[33:10] west and you were listening to some uh
[33:12] weirdos on the internet who maybe didn't
[33:15] even reveal the face and say like oh
[33:17] yeah it's a good thing we we we push we
[33:20] we're gonna push the central banks away
[33:22] so like that that was a if you actually
[33:25] had the guts and the forid to see that
[33:28] you deserve to be rich like honestly you
[33:31] you deserve that yeah I totally agree I
[33:33] think you know it's the same thing you
[33:35] if you when Microsoft ipoed how would
[33:38] anyone know they were to become one of
[33:41] the most important companies in the
[33:43] world loads of companies ipoed around
[33:45] that time most of them have gone Bust or
[33:47] gone nowhere a few of them are shining
[33:49] stars and it's just like Bitcoin I mean
[33:52] we should talk about Bitcoin and all the
[33:53] other crypto at some point because
[33:56] that's a quite a fascinating little
[33:57] subject as well but um did you wear
[34:01] other other Al coins me yeah yeah yeah
[34:05] yeah yeah I I got caught up into the
[34:07] whole crazy um should I tell you about
[34:10] my journey into
[34:12] Bitcoin um so I kind of first heard
[34:15] about it I think it was 201 either 15 or
[34:18] 16 um a a dad of one of the dad's at
[34:22] school my daughter's school was um
[34:24] talking to me about it and he said he's
[34:25] mining Bitcoin in his garage and I'm
[34:28] like what L literally what are you
[34:31] talking about and he said I've got
[34:33] servers in my garage and I'm mining
[34:36] Bitcoin and he tried to explain it to me
[34:38] and I just
[34:39] thought what what an idiot I'm like
[34:41] literally no idea what you're talking
[34:43] about is aren't you supposed to put your
[34:44] car in the garage he's now worth
[34:47] hundreds of millions but that's another
[34:49] discussion but um so I heard about it
[34:51] then and then I kind of just it was just
[34:53] this thing I think I might have heard
[34:54] about it slightly earlier but I just
[34:56] dismissed it like lots of people
[34:58] and then in
[34:59] 2017 I um I think on the the peak going
[35:02] up there was a peak around
[35:05] 20178 I uh I was working for a fintech
[35:08] uh startup business and I um the CEO was
[35:12] really into it and he's like this
[35:14] thing's amazing look I've just bought at
[35:16] 3,000 sold at 5,000 I've made and so I
[35:19] was like okay that looks interesting he
[35:21] showed me how to do it I had an account
[35:23] with eoro and I set up account with
[35:26] coinbase I think I think Coos is around
[35:28] then and um I just thought all right
[35:31] well I I'll have a little dabble I'll
[35:33] I'll put some money in I think I
[35:35] invested
[35:36] 500 um early very early on I realized
[35:39] you didn't have to buy a Bitcoin I
[35:41] realized you could buy they weren't I
[35:43] didn't know the word Satoshi until this
[35:44] year but I knew you could buy a fraction
[35:45] of a Bitcoin so I did that and saw the
[35:48] investment jump up and I sold it a few
[35:50] months later and I'd made 100% gain I
[35:54] was like this is crazy and the price
[35:55] kept going up so I then bought it back
[35:57] in again bought a bit more and then the
[35:59] price collapsed and at the same time I
[36:01] also bought ethereum because I I had no
[36:05] idea that they were different they were
[36:07] just all bucketed together
[36:09] cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin ethereum
[36:12] xrp and all of these others so I just
[36:15] looked at the charts on coinbase I could
[36:18] see the big and I just bought all the
[36:19] big ones I bought xrp at a ridiculous
[36:23] price I think I can't remember what I
[36:24] paid but but five or six times the
[36:26] current price
[36:28] um right at the peak in
[36:29] 2017 so I invested in yeah eth Bitcoin
[36:33] Ripple and a couple of others and then
[36:36] it all collapsed in value and and I just
[36:38] something in me said there's might be
[36:40] something here so I'm not going to sell
[36:42] it because it wasn't a huge amount of
[36:43] money I put some money in it had
[36:45] collapsed in value I'm like well let's
[36:47] just keep it there because you just
[36:48] don't know and that was a good decision
[36:52] thankfully um and then then it sort of
[36:54] bumbled along and I just got didn't
[36:56] really get involved anymore
[36:58] um didn't look at it that much and then
[37:01] around Co um I think I can't remember
[37:05] exactly when around that the Ico when
[37:07] there was all these initial coin
[37:08] offerings and meme coin things started
[37:10] taking yeah 2017 right was it was it
[37:13] that early okay 2017 was originally but
[37:17] obviously in uh 2020 2021 there was also
[37:21] a
[37:22] huge 2021 thing was when I really got
[37:25] into the mem coin thing I was working
[37:27] for a I was advising a record label and
[37:29] there was a couple of other people in
[37:31] the company doing this and we checking
[37:33] with each other what have you bought
[37:34] today what have you bought today oh
[37:36] funfare Tron and just making these up I
[37:39] had absolutely no idea what I was buying
[37:41] but I just couple hundred pound in there
[37:43] couple hundred pound in there thinking
[37:44] they're all about to just go
[37:46] stratospheric and of course all of them
[37:48] collapsed I mean I'm sure there is some
[37:51] value in some of them somewhere but I I
[37:53] just it was just number go up I was
[37:56] doing it to I was treating as play money
[37:58] maybe I'll make a bit of money and some
[38:00] of them did go up and I did exit at the
[38:02] right time we're not talking vast
[38:03] amounts of money um and I really started
[38:07] thinking hang on I don't know what I'm
[38:08] doing here I'm investing in something I
[38:09] don't understand Bitcoin has not gone
[38:13] away it still seems to be the biggest I
[38:14] wonder why that is and then covid
[38:17] happened everything completely collapsed
[38:19] but the thing with the Ico is what was
[38:21] what was interesting it became and again
[38:24] this only became apparent to me this
[38:25] year that the whole Ico thing was
[38:28] getting the coin issuer rich and making
[38:30] everyone who invested poor so if you got
[38:32] in very early you you issued a load of
[38:35] tokens to yourself you flooded the
[38:37] market with the tokens everyone rushed
[38:38] into buy you exited at the peak and
[38:41] that's how lots of people become
[38:43] multimillionaires by having a coin that
[38:45] had no utility did nothing just had a
[38:47] stupid name and it's like oh how did I
[38:50] fall for that as lots of other people
[38:52] did so fast forward then to this year um
[38:56] around the start of the year I was like
[38:59] I'd been on this journey I did a little
[39:01] course called the defi Academy run by a
[39:04] guy called Brian Rose u in the UK and it
[39:07] was an education course on
[39:09] cryptocurrency and I wanted to kind of
[39:12] understand it a little bit more because
[39:13] I've been through a couple of cycles and
[39:15] I thought I'll I'll do this and I'll
[39:16] really dig into it did the course and
[39:20] all of that is about we'll give you
[39:22] early access to the next token so that
[39:25] you can be one of those people that sell
[39:27] the money at the peak I thought it still
[39:30] sounds a bit wrong it just still doesn't
[39:33] sound right that you basically what
[39:35] we're going to do is we're going to make
[39:36] you on the inside of this game and
[39:39] essentially it became increasingly
[39:41] apparent that all of these coins were
[39:42] basically
[39:44] gambling except Bitcoin so I did that
[39:47] course I sat with it for a little while
[39:50] this is I think February this year and I
[39:52] just I then started doing a little bit
[39:54] of research and I found this the first
[39:56] time I met Michael say
[39:57] saw one of his speeches of like hang on
[40:00] a minute this is this this makes much
[40:02] more sense and then I saw Jack Mar's uh
[40:05] from one of the Bitcoin conferences
[40:08] where he talks about there is only
[40:09] Bitcoin and then he talks about how
[40:11] ethereum can just vitalic can just issue
[40:14] more coins and you start to really
[40:17] understand it took me about four months
[40:19] to really get that Bitcoin was the only
[40:21] thing that
[40:23] counted oh sorry I just uh for for
[40:26] reference uh uh I think this learning of
[40:29] that you just described from 2021 to to
[40:32] here it's actually quite sorry I didn't
[40:34] want to interrupt you uh it's actually
[40:37] quite fascinating we had like almost 70%
[40:41] dominance of
[40:42] bitcoin1 and then all those craziness
[40:45] came out
[40:46] with the exact time yeah exactly and
[40:50] since then it's kind of flat here and
[40:52] it's crawling back up the dominance of
[40:54] Bitcoin uh since like this 2020 areas of
[40:58] I I hope I don't know like uh maybe this
[41:01] was the big uh part where uh this do com
[41:05] bubble thing uh in the 2000 uh was
[41:08] coming where all those crazy internet
[41:10] startups came up and then like only a
[41:12] few Act made it through there uh or
[41:15] maybe we still have it in front of us
[41:17] maybe the real Ico bubble and stuff like
[41:19] that comes up when Bitcoin is like 200k
[41:22] or something like that uh but as a
[41:24] reference I just uh soor I didn't I mean
[41:27] that chart sums it up I mean I I things
[41:30] I could have invested into Bitcoin I did
[41:32] invest into all these crazy meme coins
[41:34] and I just sat down and wrote them all
[41:36] out well why have I got all these coins
[41:38] I don't know what they do I've got no
[41:39] idea what they are and within four
[41:41] months of doing that course that was to
[41:43] teach me to basically be on the inside
[41:46] of of the mem coin or the altcoin thing
[41:50] I got rid of all of them converted every
[41:52] coin I had into Bitcoin so I'm 100% in
[41:55] Bitcoin now I'm I'm not
[41:57] I I'm tempted because you see all of
[42:00] these stories about this is the next
[42:01] coin that's going to pop but I'm like no
[42:03] be sensible it's about the long term
[42:05] this is not for the short term I've
[42:07] opened Bitcoin accounts for both my
[42:09] children I'm investing uh small DCA for
[42:12] them I've managed to get 10% of my
[42:15] pension moved into Bitcoin uh which my
[42:18] pension trustee is really uncomfortable
[42:20] about they won't let me put any more in
[42:23] but it just seem it's so obvious to me
[42:25] that all of everything else I'm not
[42:27] going to say the word it's an scoin so
[42:30] it's Bitcoin or scoin and you have to go
[42:33] through it I don't know anybody I've not
[42:34] come across anybody that got it early on
[42:37] because they're bundled together it's
[42:39] cryptocurrency and it isn't it's Bitcoin
[42:42] and totally different things the
[42:44] decentralized nature of Bitcoin is
[42:46] amazing no owner no profit being made no
[42:49] company overheads so there you that's
[42:51] that's Bitcoin absolutely yeah 100% I I
[42:55] I love it a lot when I hear the story is
[42:57] because what I hear is like or I came
[43:00] into Bitcoin or I saw the the gains that
[43:03] other people kind of made or like I
[43:05] wanted to gamble I wanted to get into
[43:07] altcoins also and then I realized oh
[43:10] only Bitcoin makes sense the the more I
[43:12] actually educated myself so that that
[43:15] story is uh I
[43:18] think first of I think almost everyone
[43:21] goes through that like almost everyone
[43:23] is like ah there's also the scrypto
[43:25] things like I was also first in uh
[43:27] investigating Bitcoin then investigating
[43:29] ethereum I actually bought some uh and
[43:32] then after a year I was like oh it
[43:36] doesn't make sense to me I I put
[43:38] everything in Bitcoin I even had like
[43:39] some really small meme gaming tokens
[43:44] some I don't know I don't even know what
[43:45] it it is till now but yeah it's uh it's
[43:49] funny to see and it's also really
[43:51] interesting this this chart that I
[43:53] brought up with the Bitcoin dominance uh
[43:55] where we are right now with like % by
[43:57] the way there are the stable coins
[43:59] inside there so if you calculate stable
[44:02] coins out there which stable coins are
[44:05] for me more feared than crypto because
[44:08] yeah they're bound to this if you count
[44:10] them out we are really like almost 80%
[44:13] dominance in Bitcoin so it's like really
[44:16] clear dominance uh but even now we are
[44:18] 60% dominance even with the stable coins
[44:21] uh and especially interesting is for me
[44:24] of course the second uh or third biggest
[44:27] ethereum uh where we have since they
[44:31] switched from proof of work to proof of
[44:34] stake uh they just crashing against
[44:37] Bitcoin it's super interesting to see I
[44:39] think 2020 somewhere in the middle uh
[44:41] they switched and since they adopted
[44:43] it's just like a a constant go down uh
[44:47] so I think um it's very clear uh from an
[44:52] educational and content standpoint that
[44:53] Bitcoin has won but also now the free
[44:56] market and the the capital markets seem
[44:59] to get it now the ETF was another great
[45:02] example how the the volume at the
[45:05] ethereum ETF the volume of the Bitcoin
[45:07] ETF that's two different worlds yeah
[45:10] completely I mean I the manyi is there
[45:13] amazing video of italic singing at a
[45:16] conference somewhere and you just think
[45:18] you just look that and you just think no
[45:21] I'm sorry but no but yeah I mean I I
[45:23] also think didn't they reveal recently
[45:25] that they issue lots of new e to cover
[45:27] the overheads of the company every month
[45:29] 100 some ridiculous amount of money it's
[45:33] like well that's all you're doing is
[45:34] diluting the existing ethereum holders
[45:37] by doing that and all of the coins work
[45:39] that way so yeah I I'm I'm totally 100%
[45:43] sold on bitcoin there is nothing else in
[45:46] in this space it is the currency of the
[45:48] internet absolutely yeah it's it's crazy
[45:51] to see and yeah it's it's all I love the
[45:56] memes online when when you see vitalic
[45:59] singing somewhere or some weird position
[46:02] and and they're like yeah you put your
[46:04] whole financial energy in that one
[46:06] person and yeah they're doing uh I mean
[46:09] that's kind of what what governments are
[46:12] doing also like they they are trying to
[46:14] run this system and then they like oh
[46:17] [ __ ] like there's some emergency there's
[46:19] like Co there's uh War there's whatever
[46:22] there is there's some reason um like if
[46:26] you can print money uh for an emergency
[46:29] for free you will find emergencies
[46:34] everywhere if if if I had a business
[46:36] model where I'm like okay if there's an
[46:38] emergency going on somewhere uh I can
[46:41] print money uh yeah I would I would go
[46:44] out and say like oh who who has an
[46:46] emergency like where's the where's the
[46:48] next emergency so I think uh this this
[46:51] incentivizing of finding emergencies is
[46:54] is something uh really wrong with our
[46:57] system and uh this is kind of probably
[47:00] also where ether is now they are like
[47:02] okay we have to run the marketing system
[47:04] so we have to delute our own uh shares
[47:07] basically and they will do it over and
[47:09] over and over again till yeah they are
[47:12] at zero value and they're bankrupt yeah
[47:14] I'm afraid so absolutely really cool uh
[47:17] one topic that we also wanted to get
[47:19] into because we are already approaching
[47:21] the one hour mark and we did not touch
[47:23] it touch on it you said uh you had a
[47:27] book about uh mmt modern money Theory
[47:30] modern monetary Theory yeah monetary
[47:32] Theory
[47:33] yeah first of all like what what is that
[47:36] and and then let's get into it so I only
[47:39] heard about this uh this year um one of
[47:43] my brothers told me about it and I read
[47:45] the book and I just so modern the
[47:48] summary of modern man theater as far as
[47:50] I can work out is that if you are a
[47:52] government that issues your own currency
[47:54] like the UK um I mean Austria can't
[47:58] because you're in the Euro so like the
[48:00] UK or um America
[48:03] Japan because you are issuing your own
[48:06] currency there is no limit to the amount
[48:08] you can issue so the debt doesn't matter
[48:11] so the fact that the US is 35 trillion
[48:13] in debt doesn't make any difference they
[48:15] could be a trillion trillion in debt and
[48:18] essentially modern monetary Theory says
[48:20] that that doesn't matter the debt
[48:22] doesn't matter you can just keep issuing
[48:24] money now as that ties to your point
[48:26] about needing Wars and everything else
[48:28] and you you read the book and you sit
[48:30] there go am I missing something here I
[48:33] mean to me it just sounds like complete
[48:35] nonsense um that a government can issue
[48:38] because it means that only a handful of
[48:41] governments around the world can
[48:42] actually do this and the rest of the
[48:44] world be damned so the whole you know if
[48:47] the if the US is the only country that
[48:48] can do this all of Africa is totally
[48:51] screwed most of the the rest of the
[48:53] world because they don't have the power
[48:55] to issue their own currency or their
[48:56] currency doesn't have any value on the
[48:58] global SC scale so it seems to be the
[49:02] complete antithesis of Bitcoin where
[49:04] we've got the limited
[49:05] Supply if as we talked about earlier
[49:08] many of those early coins are lost we
[49:10] may only have I mean it could be as
[49:12] small as 11 million left if 10 million
[49:15] have gone I know nobody thinks it's that
[49:16] big but it could easily be we can't see
[49:19] but let's say we'll go with a normal
[49:21] normal figure 15 million uh are
[49:24] available or either owned or still on
[49:26] Exchange es or still to be
[49:28] mined um that makes complete sense
[49:32] everybody knows what the rules are the
[49:34] problem with being able to issue your
[49:36] own currency is no one knows what the
[49:37] rules are and it's very clear to me now
[49:39] having read all of the recent books the
[49:42] Bitcoin standard mod um the broken money
[49:45] and various others that all that's
[49:47] happening is creating inflation so
[49:50] issuing money the increase in money
[49:52] supply simply creates inflation that
[49:53] pushes prices up that is C cusing the
[49:57] cost of living crisis and causing all of
[49:59] the issues and so with modern monetary
[50:02] Theory I mean frankly you read it and
[50:04] you just you I'm scratching my head
[50:06] going there's got to be something wrong
[50:07] here because she even goes to the point
[50:09] where she says it doesn't matter about
[50:11] the interest because you simply issue
[50:13] more money to pay the interest so you're
[50:16] creating money out of thin air to flood
[50:19] the system and then when there's
[50:20] interest you you just create more money
[50:21] to pay the interest now to your point
[50:24] about we need Wars and everything else
[50:27] if a government can issue money to solve
[50:29] any problem themselves why don't they
[50:32] just issue enough money to solve poverty
[50:34] in their own country why do you even
[50:37] need a war why do you even need to tax
[50:39] anybody if the government can issue the
[50:42] currency there's no need for tax they
[50:45] just keep printing the money and so the
[50:48] minute you sort of dig into it you're
[50:49] just like no this something wrong here
[50:52] so I um I'm going to reread it because I
[50:56] just it didn't make a lot of sense when
[50:58] I read the book for the first time um
[51:00] she talks about it quite often it seems
[51:03] to have been a fad I think I'm not sure
[51:05] when her book came out seems to been a
[51:07] fed maybe five or six years ago where
[51:10] people were talking about mmt mmt is the
[51:12] truth and all economic theories are
[51:14] before this are wrong but I cannot I I
[51:17] just cannot see how it's viable for you
[51:20] to keep issuing money it just doesn't
[51:22] make any sense there's nothing backing
[51:24] it mmt is definitely on The View that
[51:27] being tied to the like when Nixon took
[51:30] it took the US of the gold standard the
[51:33] mm's view is you don't need anything to
[51:35] back it it's all just based on our
[51:37] choice so the US government is is the
[51:40] backer of the money and we can keep
[51:43] printing just doesn't make any
[51:45] sense the the the point is always for me
[51:48] like creating money out of nothing
[51:53] creates nothing like you you you you
[51:55] don't create any actual value so like uh
[52:00] we we need money to be linked to actual
[52:04] value uh and and actual physical things
[52:07] and with with Bitcoin we actually have
[52:10] this amazing thing where we finally
[52:13] solved uh having the physical link of
[52:16] money that was like gold and other
[52:18] things uh in the past with the digital
[52:20] thing created with the mining process
[52:22] because there's actual proof of work
[52:24] behind it uh and there just this limited
[52:27] Supply and uh because of the proof of
[52:30] work because of the decentralized nature
[52:32] with all the nodes running uh we can
[52:34] ensure that limit so it's the first time
[52:37] ever we created this connection between
[52:39] the digital and the physical world uh
[52:43] where when uh where we actually have the
[52:47] um uh backing of real world uh value and
[52:50] real world energy and all this other
[52:53] things are not like that so we are just
[52:56] great more money and it just uh creates
[52:59] nothing so uh that but I still have to
[53:03] read the book because I I think it's um
[53:07] uh really important to get into other
[53:09] theories and and see the theories of
[53:12] your opponent or of of your of other FS
[53:15] or what of the opposition um to actually
[53:18] see how they think and this either makes
[53:21] you like oh I was actually wrong I don't
[53:24] think that will happen when I read the
[53:25] book but rather than like oh now I get
[53:28] how they think and maybe I can then
[53:31] explain even Bitcoin better I think that
[53:33] that that's actually um we I think it's
[53:36] really good to inform yourself around
[53:39] other theories also I love that you're
[53:41] doing that yeah I mean I I often look at
[53:44] negative podcast about po Bitcoin
[53:47] because if you if you get caught up into
[53:49] the the echo chamber of only looking at
[53:51] Bitcoin videos that are all talking
[53:53] about number go up bitcoin's going to
[53:55] save the world Etc Etc you can kind of
[53:57] get a little bit hooked in so I actively
[54:00] look at people who are like gold bugs
[54:02] like Peter Schiff and all of these other
[54:03] people who are basically saying
[54:04] bitcoin's going to zero it has no value
[54:07] so that I try and get their view I mean
[54:09] back on model monetary theory for a
[54:11] second the I think your point about
[54:13] proof of work is the key thing so when
[54:15] gold was backing the currency there is
[54:17] proof of work somebody has literally dug
[54:19] a hole mined it and taken it out
[54:22] somebody's worked to create that value
[54:25] now of course gold doesn't actually
[54:26] having intrinsic value it's simply a
[54:28] Shiny Rock but because everybody agrees
[54:31] that it's very hard to get out of the
[54:33] ground it's uh one of the most pre I
[54:36] can't remember the properties of gold
[54:39] but it can't really be used for much
[54:40] other than jewelry some industrial use
[54:43] but as a store of value but the proof of
[54:46] work is doing it and you're right is a
[54:48] government issuing money literally right
[54:50] we're going to flood the market with
[54:51] another1 trillion dollar click it's it's
[54:54] literally a click of amount
[54:57] there's nothing behind it so they are
[54:59] creating money I didn't understand that
[55:01] when you go to the bank to borrow money
[55:03] and let's say you borrow uh half a
[55:05] million euros for a mortgage the money
[55:08] doesn't exist until you take the
[55:10] mortgage out I had no idea that that's
[55:13] how it works I thought the bank
[55:15] literally had the half a million and
[55:17] they gave it to me so that I could buy
[55:19] the house but they don't have the money
[55:22] this fractional Reserve banking thing
[55:24] they they have a small amount of the
[55:25] money and as they give you the mortgage
[55:28] the money is created at that moment it's
[55:30] like that's just
[55:33] nuts no idea that blew my mind too when
[55:37] when I got that like uh when when I I
[55:39] think it was a short information video
[55:41] on YouTube like three four minute video
[55:43] and I'm like no that cannot be true that
[55:46] that has to be like that they cannot
[55:48] just create money like that that that
[55:51] that has to be fake but it actually it's
[55:53] fascinating that this is true yeah um um
[55:56] before we get to the tin um I have one
[55:59] more question uh which which sounds uh
[56:03] simple but maybe we get get into an
[56:06] interesting topic um why do you
[56:09] accumulate Bitcoin are you accumulating
[56:11] Bitcoin for like a retirement to
[56:13] increase your wealth like what what what
[56:15] your what are you trying to um get after
[56:19] with with accumulating Bitcoin or maybe
[56:21] even for future generation so to start
[56:24] with I like most people who discover it
[56:26] coin I saw it as an investment
[56:28] opportunity number go up which is a
[56:31] phrase I don't like but um I I thought
[56:34] okay this is just part of my looking
[56:37] after myself in old age and everything
[56:39] else and didn't so it was interesting
[56:42] because it was on the edge I've got a a
[56:44] classic balanced portfolio stocks and
[56:46] shares and I've got no bonds thankfully
[56:48] but um and I don't have a huge pension
[56:51] but I just saw it as an investment and
[56:53] then the more you dig into it you're
[56:54] like hang on this is a bit bigger
[56:56] so I'm now seeing it as I mean I'm a I'm
[56:59] a definite hodler I'm no intention of
[57:01] selling whatever happens to the price um
[57:04] and I see it much more as generational
[57:07] wealth now as this is this is um a train
[57:10] that I need to be on I need to be on for
[57:13] my my life my children's life my family
[57:16] my future Generations so from a
[57:18] financial perspective I see it as
[57:20] building a war chest
[57:22] to I will sell it partly if it's all
[57:25] I've got will have to sell it to live on
[57:27] because you can't you've got to convert
[57:28] it to fear if fear is still around um so
[57:33] it's yes it's about it's about
[57:35] protecting my my personal wealth and my
[57:37] family's wealth as we as we get older
[57:39] making sure my children can buy a house
[57:42] hopefully one day you know I see it as
[57:44] that sort of helping set them up but
[57:47] then when you get into the broader
[57:48] aspects and you start learning about it
[57:50] being more than just about your personal
[57:52] Journey it you can see how being part of
[57:56] Bitcoin ecosystem I I hear people talk
[57:58] about it make you think think much
[58:01] longer term and I see that in myself you
[58:03] know do I really need that thing whereas
[58:07] I could maybe buy a bit more Bitcoin and
[58:09] invest a little into the future so for
[58:11] me Pro the primary thing is an
[58:13] investment vehicle um and slowly
[58:16] transferring wealth across into it
[58:19] setting up my children for the future
[58:22] and then thinking about right how I mean
[58:25] I'm actively thinking about how can I be
[58:27] involved in the ecosystem somehow to
[58:30] help spread it I I no intention to to
[58:32] work in it at this stage but it's just
[58:34] so yeah it's investment I think is the
[58:36] primary thing the how it can save the
[58:40] world I'm still struggling with you
[58:42] often hear people it's going to save the
[58:44] world I'm like okay I can kind of see
[58:46] that I haven't made that full leap
[58:48] yet yeah and and I think it gets
[58:52] sometimes too extreme I I think um money
[58:56] touches almost everything or probably
[58:59] touches everything uh in some sense and
[59:02] of course if we have uh better money we
[59:06] will have also better lives but it
[59:08] doesn't like this fix the money fix the
[59:10] world I think sometimes is taken too far
[59:14] uh uh but it is true that uh if you fix
[59:19] the incentive around money that you
[59:22] actually get a lot of better outcomes at
[59:25] least like how I SE it uh but we
[59:28] sometimes take it too far as a
[59:30] Bitcoin fix the money fix the world and
[59:32] they're like this is broken let's fix it
[59:35] with Bitcoin but there's some truth to
[59:37] it because it aligns uh the incentives
[59:40] and it's it's really really cool uh do
[59:42] see that yeah I think I think the other
[59:44] challenge of course is the fluctuation
[59:46] in price so for it to be although that's
[59:49] how where um gains are being made for it
[59:52] to be used as a currency that has to
[59:54] really flatten out and I know it's um
[59:56] legitimized in El Salvador but I was
[59:59] reading an article the other day about
[60:00] it and although it can be used most
[60:03] people in Els are still using
[60:05] dollars and I think because why would
[60:08] you spend Bitcoin today if it's going to
[60:11] go up in value you'll spend dollars
[60:13] today because they go down in value so I
[60:16] think that there's we're we're at that
[60:17] Tipping Point now I know we everyone has
[60:19] these crazy numbers about a a Bitcoin
[60:22] will be worth a million 10 I've heard
[60:23] some people say 10 million 100 million
[60:26] but you think okay if it levels out at
[60:28] say 200,000 it probably will be more but
[60:31] let's say it levels out at that and then
[60:32] it doesn't fluctuate anymore so much
[60:35] then you can see it can then start to be
[60:37] extended and being used you know at the
[60:40] moment B using Bitcoin to buy a cup of
[60:42] coffee is probably a bit stupid because
[60:46] if if it isn't increas in value you want
[60:48] to sell the you want to use a currency
[60:50] that's going down in value to buy your
[60:51] coffee or don't buy the coffee and buy
[60:53] more Bitcoin
[60:56] yeah it's it's in I even think that this
[61:01] volatility might even go up a little bit
[61:04] uh in in the coming years uh if Bitcoin
[61:07] actually follows that S curve adoption
[61:10] uh which technology usually follows then
[61:14] if it does follow that Trend the next 10
[61:17] 20 years will be crazy in in terms of
[61:19] adoption and then if a lot of people
[61:22] come in there will be a lot of uh
[61:25] volatility but I could be wrong here I
[61:27] just think we are at such an early age
[61:29] and we if Bitcoin actually is what we
[61:31] think it is uh 99% of the people still
[61:36] have to come into Bitcoin even the
[61:39] people that are into Bitcoin they
[61:42] usually have like oh like 5% or 10% of
[61:44] their portfolio in Bitcoin and they
[61:46] probably come in with way more money
[61:48] than than before so uh I think
[61:51] volatility is is there for a long time
[61:53] like I think that that's not something
[61:55] that goes away anytime soon we we we are
[61:58] too early and and too small for for that
[62:00] at least as as I see it yeah I think
[62:03] when you see that chart I can't remember
[62:05] who put it together that shows the value
[62:06] of everything the 900 trillion and
[62:08] Bitcoin being one trillion of the 900
[62:11] trillion you can see that it's still got
[62:14] a very long way I mean if it equals gold
[62:16] in the next 10 years uh that that would
[62:20] be an incredible increase in value of
[62:23] per Bitcoin or per Satoshi I think maybe
[62:25] interestingly that if we can move away
[62:27] from Bitcoin and move towards Satoshi it
[62:30] will open it up to a few more people
[62:32] because people see the price of Bitcoin
[62:33] so I can't unold that but if we started
[62:36] pricing things in Satoshi people might
[62:38] think slightly differently I think you
[62:39] mean that one right yep that's the one
[62:42] that that's from chesse
[62:44] Myers yeah that's from chesse Myers
[62:47] crosses also from that that your gr
[62:49] slightly old cuz bitcoin's only 400
[62:51] billion there but
[62:53] nevertheless um yeah that's that's the
[62:55] one one true that's that's that's
[62:58] probably I think that's the original one
[63:00] that he got out uh when he first got a
[63:03] year ago isn't it because that was the
[63:05] market cap of Bitcoin about a year ago I
[63:08] could be right could be are yeah but but
[63:10] definitely uh that is amazing and for
[63:13] everyone that is interested I think
[63:15] Jesse Myers is is an amazing guy and has
[63:18] really good analogies um I interviewed
[63:21] him actually and this interviews on my
[63:23] channel and we we talked about that and
[63:25] an updated mod of that and where he
[63:27] thinks the Bitcoin price is going and
[63:29] especially he always puts it in
[63:31] perspective in what what else is
[63:34] on on there and it was an amazing
[63:36] discussion so just like type in Jesse
[63:38] Myers on on my channel and you will get
[63:41] to it um it's it's an amazing uh it was
[63:44] a really good podcast with him I I
[63:46] remember so where we discussed that that
[63:50] very picture uh yeah it's it's it's uh I
[63:54] think it's it's one of the best
[63:56] Bitcoin pricing models in terms of like
[63:59] what's realistic because then you can
[64:01] actually put yourself together okay how
[64:04] much of the wealth of the world will
[64:07] Bitcoin capture once I am 50 or 60 years
[64:11] old and then you can build your own
[64:13] theories around that and he he put a lot
[64:16] of work into collecting the numbers
[64:18] because it was not as easy to collect
[64:20] the numbers how much is there in
[64:21] equities how much is there in bonds and
[64:23] real estate and stuff like that yeah no
[64:26] it's a good chart I like that one you
[64:27] need to update that slide
[64:31] absolutely it's uh it's like 400 billion
[64:35] and now it's like 1.4 or 1.3 or
[64:38] something like that so it's like Mass 19
[64:41] Gold's gone crazy this year um true true
[64:45] yeah Gold's up as well perfect and yeah
[64:48] thank you so much I have one question
[64:50] that every one of my guests gets what
[64:52] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[64:59] um I can teach you how to um make a
[65:03] record in a recording studio I can
[65:06] try it's it's not very Bitcoin friendly
[65:09] and I haven't done it for a long time um
[65:11] but yeah no um
[65:13] yeah just that's a really difficult
[65:17] question to answer actually Roman um I I
[65:21] yeah how how to very boring stuff how to
[65:24] set up a business
[65:26] uh how how to set up a business and all
[65:28] all of that I've run lots of different
[65:29] businesses so just the things you need
[65:32] to do to set up a business structure and
[65:34] and all all of those or I could teach
[65:36] you in a recording studio absolutely I
[65:39] think that's a very important uh things
[65:42] to to to learn about uh but uh we better
[65:46] don't get started with that otherwise
[65:48] it's another
[65:50] podcast perfect and yeah thank you so
[65:52] much we have end in the podcast where
[65:53] the previous guest is asking a question
[65:55] for for the next guest without knowing
[65:57] who the next guest is uh it's it's a
[65:59] similar question but different uh what
[66:02] is more important to you than Bitcoin my
[66:06] family oh yeah that's that's an obvious
[66:08] one yeah yeah
[66:10] cool so yeah there you go perfect and
