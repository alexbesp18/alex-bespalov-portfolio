[00:00] 10 years ago Bitcoin was only worth
[00:02] around $200 per Bitcoin with a market
[00:05] cap of only 130 million now it's 2
[00:08] trillion so that's a 15,000 x increase
[00:11] in just 10 years so where is it going to
[00:13] be in the next 10 years I think it's
[00:15] important to understand the uh history
[00:17] of money and and what makes a good money
[00:19] because that's the only way to really
[00:21] get an appreciation of the power of
[00:23] Bitcoin and and how important it is
[00:25] Bitcoin is the invention or some say the
[00:28] discovery of digital scarcity and once
[00:30] that's discovered you know the Genies
[00:32] out of the bottle can't be discovered
[00:33] again Bitcoin Works in a similar way not
[00:36] through traditional interest but through
[00:38] exponential adoption you know once it
[00:40] gets going it really takes off and and
[00:42] and this is the power of exponential
[00:43] numbers exponential growth is equal to
[00:46] progress you know one day we'll probably
[00:47] look back on bitcoin and say well
[00:48] actually Bitcoin made trust cheaper
[00:50] every revolutionary truth has come with
[00:52] a price paid in resistance ridicule and
[00:55] often personal sacrifice and we call
[00:57] these people Heretics not because they
[00:58] were wrong but they were right to
[01:00] [Music]
[01:04] soon I'm really excited uh we had uh
[01:07] only one presentation till now like a
[01:10] proper presentation with like slides
[01:11] prepared and it was actually the second
[01:14] most watched video right after sailor so
[01:17] the buy is
[01:19] high and let's see where where this this
[01:22] goes and I think it's really interesting
[01:24] what you prepared and uh I'm I'm always
[01:27] curious when someone put together
[01:29] something really interesting and and put
[01:32] his thoughts into some nice flow in
[01:34] there uh and I'm really curious on on on
[01:37] where this goes today and the question
[01:39] of like the 53 trillion plus opportunity
[01:42] it's is really an intriguing one um but
[01:45] maybe just before we get started with
[01:47] that H give us some background of like
[01:50] what you doing who you are how long
[01:51] you're in Bitcoin and stuff like that
[01:52] just so we have a small picture of like
[01:55] who who you
[01:56] are y all right cool um yep so mon
[01:59] blocky I've uh been involved with
[02:03] Bitcoin or at least I I've known about
[02:04] it since 2012 I actually um uh first
[02:09] heard about Bitcoin because I heard
[02:10] about Silk Road and I was interested in
[02:14] Silk Road and I thought H I'd like to
[02:17] try this Marketplace out I've always
[02:18] been a bit of a Libertarian at heart and
[02:20] that was in 2012 I think it was around
[02:22] about October 2012 and I wanted to uh
[02:25] sample a few things from uh the the Silk
[02:28] Road and I had to get some Bitcoin um so
[02:32] I worked out how to get Bitcoin and
[02:34] wasn't easy back then and they R about
[02:36] $10 of Bitcoin back then and I must have
[02:38] had about 10 or 20 Bitcoin but of course
[02:41] I just spent them I had no idea what
[02:43] Bitcoin was but I do remember thinking
[02:46] because my background is actually
[02:47] technology um I've been working mostly
[02:50] in cyber security for the past 20 years
[02:53] uh around the world um mostly in
[02:56] Australia or in the UK uh and working
[02:58] for the big dirty Banks uh in the in the
[03:02] uh doing some dirty Fiat mining um but
[03:06] anyway at this point actually uh I um I
[03:09] remember looking at Bitcoin thinking
[03:11] yeah it's really probably something I
[03:13] should look at and I remember reading a
[03:15] couple of magazine articles and thinking
[03:17] yeah I'll come back to that but I didn't
[03:20] until 2016 and interestingly that was
[03:23] when Trump came into Power uh just
[03:27] around that time and I thought well I
[03:30] don't know what's going to happen here
[03:32] the whole financial world could you know
[03:34] go go under you know go up in Flames I
[03:37] have no idea what's going to happen and
[03:40] um I ended up buying some Bitcoin and
[03:42] that was the first Bitcoin I bought um
[03:46] to actually keep and uh of course I
[03:48] didn't get nearly get nearly enough um
[03:52] but uh and then couple you know not long
[03:56] after that I think it was 2018 I read
[03:57] the Bitcoin standard uh and became
[03:59] Bitcoin Maxi and and have been one ever
[04:02] since cool yeah and these days um yeah
[04:08] I've actually left the Fiat world uh and
[04:11] for the past you know probably about
[04:13] just over a year now I've been focused
[04:16] uh purely on bitcoin and building a
[04:18] Bitcoin uh startup as well really nice I
[04:22] I see and uh also thank you so much
[04:24] because you are uh with I think it's
[04:26] called Edge
[04:27] 21 if I'm correct uh it's you also
[04:31] reposting the podcast and like really
[04:33] breaking it down it was a plan from the
[04:35] beginning that I actually do that with
[04:36] every episode but I just haven't come
[04:39] around with that and maybe I want to do
[04:40] that uh still in in the future but it's
[04:43] great that uh with without us having a
[04:47] um like um business relation or anything
[04:50] like that you just do it because you
[04:51] found the podcast valuable and you you
[04:54] like to provide that value and that
[04:55] breakdown to the people I really uh
[04:58] enjoy that and really app appreciate
[05:00] that that you chose uh my podcast of one
[05:02] of the podcasts you're doing that with
[05:04] uh that that's really cool um but now
[05:07] with the with the topic of of Bitcoin
[05:09] and how you see the growth of it it's
[05:11] there there's two really interesting
[05:13] questions now of uh with Bitcoin uh when
[05:17] we talk about the future the one is like
[05:19] where are we going and and how do we get
[05:21] there and I think that's maybe a little
[05:23] bit of of where your presentation is is
[05:26] is headed towards if if if I'm correct
[05:29] yeah yeah absolutely um yeah the the
[05:32] kind of working title of this
[05:33] presentation is the the $53 trillion
[05:36] plus opportunity and it's it's a bit of
[05:38] a look back as to where we've been and
[05:42] where where we've come to now and then
[05:46] uh a look ahead to the next 10 years uh
[05:49] and you know what could possibly occur
[05:53] and what is likely to occur really cool
[05:55] and let's just uh directly jump into it
[05:58] yeah okay amazing amazing um all right
[06:01] cool so here it is the $53 trillion plus
[06:05] opportunity uh which I believe Bitcoin
[06:08] is uh and that is from now for uh to the
[06:13] year 2035 and uh at in the present day
[06:18] we live in the Bitcoin era and this is a
[06:22] prediction it's uh similar to some other
[06:24] predictions out there but I'm going to
[06:26] walk you through a little bit how I
[06:28] think how we get there so I think to
[06:30] start with uh it's good to look at uh
[06:33] the exponential side of things and how
[06:37] exponential growth is equal to
[06:40] progress
[06:41] and you know it can seem like we're
[06:43] living in difficult times and the things
[06:46] are getting worse and worse and worse
[06:47] and you know if you take like a I guess
[06:49] if you look at a short time period it
[06:52] can feel like you know things actually
[06:53] do take a dip but if you kind of zoom
[06:55] out and we're always saying that in the
[06:57] Bitcoin world right if you zoom out uh
[06:59] things actually have been getting better
[07:01] and better so you know there's a number
[07:03] of different stats out here but child
[07:06] mortality rates going down deaths from
[07:08] infections going down deaths from
[07:10] malnutrition down Global mortality rate
[07:13] has been trending down uh labor force
[07:16] and agriculture trending down extreme
[07:19] poverty rate down and then some UPS as
[07:22] well so literacy rate increasing over
[07:25] time life expectancy increasing and GDP
[07:28] per capita increasing
[07:30] and so the reality is that in most areas
[07:32] we're actually getting better things are
[07:33] getting better and better for Humanity
[07:36] so you know I think it's good to kind of
[07:39] take a step back and just perhaps
[07:41] sometimes you know remove yourself from
[07:43] the noise and stop thinking negatively
[07:45] as I guess reality is the positive
[07:47] thinkers get the positive results and
[07:49] actually there's a a great quote that I
[07:51] love which is whether you think you can
[07:54] or you can't you're right and you know
[07:59] that can relate to how you think about
[08:00] Bitcoin and the opportunity that's ahead
[08:02] for us you know if you think uh that
[08:05] Bitcoin is a scam and is going to zero
[08:08] well you're going to get the price you
[08:10] deserve but if you you know take a look
[08:13] at it differently uh there's a massive
[08:15] opportunity there
[08:17] so
[08:19] um revolutions
[08:22] equals a decrease in price right so
[08:25] human life has gotten better and better
[08:27] through a series of revolutions
[08:30] and with each Revolution things have
[08:32] gotten better and
[08:34] cheaper and just a few examples of
[08:38] revolutions here which um I'm sure
[08:40] you'll be very familiar with uh the pry
[08:43] press brought down the cost of
[08:45] knowledge steam the steam engine uh made
[08:49] transport cheaper the Industrial
[08:51] Revolution made manufacturing
[08:54] cheaper uh telecoms made communication
[08:57] cheaper computers made calculation
[08:59] cheaper AI obviously very recent
[09:02] development for us and uh at the
[09:04] Forefront of our minds made intelligence
[09:07] and prediction cheaper and that's only
[09:09] in the last you know two three years and
[09:11] of course Bitcoin what does that made
[09:14] cheaper and I think actually the you
[09:17] know one day we'll probably look back on
[09:18] bitcoin and say well actually Bitcoin
[09:20] made trust
[09:21] cheaper and I think you know trust is a
[09:24] massive thing in our lives uh and you'll
[09:28] probably hear me mentioned that a couple
[09:30] of times today um tech adop tech
[09:34] adoption so this is happening faster and
[09:38] faster uh and you see that often these
[09:41] Trends in TCH actually they may start a
[09:43] little slow like if we look at the TV
[09:45] had a bit of a slow start but then it t
[09:48] gradually picks up pace and takes off
[09:50] very quickly um smartphones uh Robin I'm
[09:55] not sure I'm sure you may remember a
[09:57] time before smartphones I I definitely
[09:59] do I'm definitely holding my yeah I I I
[10:01] think I'm too young for that actually um
[10:04] I remember since I
[10:09] was 13 or 14 years old I had always a
[10:12] phone it was not a smartphone I had like
[10:14] a um a slide phone like a flip phone
[10:18] kind of a thing a Sony experience
[10:20] something uh it was fun but I got a a
[10:24] Smartphone when I was like 16 or 17
[10:26] years old so I I don't know uh I I had
[10:29] my childhood under 15 under phone uh
[10:32] that's that's I think something very
[10:34] valuable that uh it's it's also
[10:37] something good to to give your kid the
[10:39] possibility to have a a smartphone less
[10:42] childhood I think it's it's really
[10:43] something great but ever since I was 16
[10:46] years 17 years old I had a phone always
[10:48] with me all the time like literally
[10:51] everywhere so I'm I'm maybe I'm too
[10:53] young for that yeah yeah yeah well I I
[10:57] um well I Tru remember that time without
[10:59] them and um yeah I have to I mean now
[11:02] I've got kids and and they've got
[11:04] smartphones and yeah sometimes I wish
[11:05] they never did have them because as we
[11:08] know they're incredibly addictive and um
[11:10] you know I have to take measures on
[11:11] myself just to ensure I you know get
[11:13] things done otherwise it can be so easy
[11:15] to uh you know just stare at that screen
[11:18] and doom scroll um but look there you
[11:22] know there was a time when nobody had a
[11:24] smartphone and then all of a sudden it
[11:26] it like you know billions of people do
[11:28] so a great example of um an exponential
[11:32] Trend where smartphones just suddenly go
[11:35] boom I I just want to make a small
[11:38] example here maybe that's interesting
[11:40] with AI because I haven't used AI in any
[11:45] way shap before knowingly two years ago
[11:49] uh probably some apps that I used us it
[11:52] in the background somehow uh but I
[11:54] haven't used it I interacted with it now
[11:57] I couldn't do do what I do currently
[12:00] without AI I have a J gbt uh license
[12:05] going on I have some other licenses
[12:07] going on that I have to pay each month
[12:09] otherwise my business is not operating
[12:11] so I'm I'm I'm not only at the point
[12:14] where I am getting better with AI I'm at
[12:17] the point where I'm depending on AI
[12:20] already uh and this was for me my
[12:23] personal transformation within two years
[12:25] where I didn't had any contact versus
[12:28] now I'm completely depending on it uh so
[12:31] this was really fast for me this trend
[12:35] uh maybe that's an interesting thing to
[12:38] to to add here because this shows how
[12:41] fast someone can can get into technology
[12:45] um without really like I didn't really
[12:47] notice it I just like tried to figure
[12:49] out it like all of the sudden I'm fully
[12:52] on it so that's that's maybe interesting
[12:53] to add here yeah that's that's a a very
[12:56] good point to make and even if I relate
[12:58] that that to smartphones I mean I can
[13:01] remember when the iPhone first came out
[13:04] and I was in London at the time and I
[13:06] didn't get one right away um but I had
[13:09] no idea what was going to happen with
[13:12] you know the iPhone and and what that
[13:14] changed and so you know as you were
[13:16] saying about AI I mean we we really have
[13:18] no idea what's going to happen I mean we
[13:20] can make predictions and plenty of
[13:21] people do but it's just going to blow us
[13:25] away I think um you know there are
[13:27] things around the corner we really
[13:30] cannot predict and cannot expect you
[13:33] know and you know to to bring it back to
[13:36] this slide here um bit I've just Bitcoin
[13:39] is you know just down here this little
[13:42] tiny you know line and the reality is
[13:45] that with Bitcoin it has just begun you
[13:48] know the key thing to keep in mind is
[13:49] that you know we are still very very
[13:52] early and we actually have no idea what
[13:56] you know Bitcoin is going to do for you
[13:59] know us for Humanity
[14:02] so it's a very very interesting time and
[14:05] and we and reality is we still are part
[14:07] of the Min minority right we are very
[14:10] part of the minority it's it's I I
[14:13] sometimes get the especially from people
[14:15] that come new to the to the Bitcoin game
[14:18] they are asking oh like it's now at 100K
[14:21] isn't it already like kind of at a
[14:23] maturity level and they always ask them
[14:26] okay um if you really understand Bitcoin
[14:29] now go out on the street uh ask 50
[14:33] people uh what's an average block time
[14:36] of of Bitcoin like some any very easy to
[14:39] answer question uh for uh normal
[14:42] bitcoiners or even like very obvious one
[14:45] like oh how many Bitcoin are there or
[14:47] like uh what is the current price of
[14:50] Bitcoin I don't know if you saw that
[14:51] video but there's uh uh there was some
[14:54] some guys going on the street and just
[14:57] interviewing people of like what's the
[14:58] current price price of Bitcoin and from
[15:00] like uh $2 to I think 20,000 or like the
[15:06] current price of that at that time
[15:07] everything was in there to even do
[15:10] opinions of like wa what Bitcoin is
[15:12] still a thing like Bitcoin still exists
[15:13] so if if you think you're not early go
[15:16] out on the street and ask people about
[15:18] Bitcoin and you're very very soon uh
[15:21] again the opinion that we are very early
[15:23] like almost nobody has Bitcoin yeah y
[15:27] absolutely and you know that's even
[15:29] evident in my own you know personal
[15:32] Circle um and yeah absolutely you know
[15:36] I'm I'm minority in my family even so
[15:39] even though they've they they know
[15:41] exactly what I do and um and what I
[15:44] think about Bitcoin but they yeah
[15:46] majority just they don't get it um and
[15:49] and there there's always then this like
[15:51] okay we had like one or two or 3%
[15:53] adoption which is um like it's always
[15:56] hard to figure out what is kind of like
[15:58] what is a bit coiner like who had
[16:00] adopted Bitcoin but then there also when
[16:02] you look at allocations most bitcoiners
[16:05] have the Bitcoin and exchange most
[16:07] bitcoiners have less than like $2,000 in
[16:11] Bitcoin uh most people have probably
[16:13] less most bitcoiners has probably less
[16:15] than 10% of their wealth in Bitcoin it's
[16:18] just like we are the crazy ones here we
[16:22] are the outliers that have like 100% or
[16:24] 80% or whatever High allocation in
[16:26] Bitcoin we are very small group of
[16:30] people like those the numbers that you
[16:31] hear with 100 million 200 million 300
[16:33] million people that have Bitcoin those
[16:36] those don't have 100% in Bitcoin like
[16:39] people actually understand it that's
[16:41] like a a few hundred thousand maybe yeah
[16:44] yep yep absolutely yeah it's incredible
[16:47] um especially when you know it clicks
[16:48] for you and you understand and and and
[16:51] and the the worst part is when you when
[16:53] you know you do understand it so well
[16:56] that it's hard to understand what
[16:59] doesn't someone else get it but it's I
[17:00] mean that that's a whole another topic
[17:01] really but but yeah um just to um uh I
[17:07] mean going back to the idea that as
[17:09] we're talking about we're we're very
[17:10] early and we're in the minority and I
[17:12] think we're still you know we're we're
[17:15] still grinding it's like the the the
[17:18] wave of Bitcoin is really just still
[17:20] taking off and it's we we see the
[17:22] adoption growing and actually I've got
[17:23] some cool slides on on the adoption um
[17:27] rate coming up but you know once it gets
[17:30] going it really takes off and and and
[17:31] this is the power of exponential numbers
[17:33] and actually just as an example so do
[17:36] you know about the you know when you
[17:37] fold a piece of paper 50 times like how
[17:40] thick it can get have you heard of that
[17:42] yeah
[17:44] just h i I heard about it I think it's
[17:48] it's it's not possible beyond like seven
[17:50] or eight times uh and then and then it's
[17:53] like a ridiculously high number of like
[17:55] it would be the distance to the moon or
[17:56] something yeah yeah actually it's even
[17:58] Beyond but so just as and again like so
[18:01] if we have a look at the the chart here
[18:02] the chart shows a bit of a hockey stick
[18:04] curve so you know yeah you're right you
[18:07] can't fold it more than about seven
[18:08] times but let's just say you could you
[18:10] know physically fold a piece of paper
[18:12] you know just 1 mm thick if you could
[18:13] fold it 50 times well on this chart you
[18:16] know we go up to about 20 folds and
[18:18] we're up to about 1,000 MERS in in
[18:20] thickness already but you see it really
[18:23] starts to go vertical and this is the
[18:25] power of exponential numbers and you
[18:27] know I run this example through people
[18:29] and they just they cannot get it they're
[18:31] like what you know and after 23 folds
[18:34] we're up to about 9,000 M but it just
[18:37] goes like Way Beyond you know you can
[18:40] see on a chart you know we'd have to go
[18:41] to log charts and even that's not going
[18:43] to um uh you know illustrate it well
[18:46] because it actually becomes over 1.1
[18:49] billion kilometers thick on the 50th
[18:51] fold so that the sun is only 150 million
[18:54] km away so uh this piece of paper would
[18:58] uh extend well past Jupiter's orbit so
[19:01] that's the power of exponential
[19:03] exponentials it's you know it's
[19:05] difficult to comprehend it's like trying
[19:07] to understand you know what is a
[19:09] trillion dollars what does that look
[19:11] like you know there's some good
[19:12] infographics out there and encourage
[19:14] people to have a look at that you know
[19:16] just Google that because um yeah even
[19:18] even a trillion dollars is you know that
[19:20] gets thrown around in the Bitcoin world
[19:22] now um and with the economy and you know
[19:26] the uh the the US debt that you know a
[19:29] trillion dollars is is extremely hard to
[19:31] even understand how much that is but if
[19:35] we just go back to the uh smartphones
[19:37] example um that was an example of a
[19:39] smartphones are an example of a
[19:41] compounded pattern it's it's it's an
[19:43] exponential curve when when it takes off
[19:45] it just really takes off and Bitcoin is
[19:47] following exactly that and the thing
[19:51] about exponential patterns is that
[19:52] they're hard to understand but if you
[19:54] really try to you know there's there's
[19:56] there's value that you can create for
[19:58] yourself here in terms of making money
[20:00] careers businesses in terms of
[20:03] understanding Bitcoin I partnered up
[20:05] with coin vigilante this is the most
[20:08] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[20:11] saw created by anyone look at that
[20:13] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[20:16] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[20:19] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[20:22] there and show that you are a bitcoiner

[22:12] how you can level up your sovereignty
[22:15] yeah it's it's the opportunity of uh
[22:18] being in an industry very early uh it's
[22:21] it's it's massive uh I think many people
[22:25] have this when they when they first got
[22:28] it into the internet and in in the in
[22:30] the com thing uh there's like such a
[22:34] ridiculous opportunity because you are
[22:36] you're having an
[22:38] information advantage of all other
[22:41] people and and people don't get how
[22:44] valuable this information Advantage is
[22:47] if you're entrenched in a community that
[22:50] is very early and it will disrupt all
[22:53] the lives on Earth uh and you being one
[22:57] of the early pioneers it's an extreme um
[23:00] advantage of having uh and and it's it's
[23:04] something uh that opened my eyes when
[23:08] Jeff Bo was on my show the first time I
[23:10] had like I had like 500 subscribers or
[23:11] something like that I just started out
[23:13] with my podcast I had like one or two
[23:15] months on on my podcast and he said like
[23:17] oh Robin is like you're young you kind
[23:20] of have to go all in on bitcoin not only
[23:23] with your financial energy but with your
[23:25] life's energy and he said it in a way
[23:27] where I'm like like you're right like I
[23:29] believe in Bitcoin uh that that that
[23:32] will change all our lives the whole
[23:34] world will change around Bitcoin and
[23:37] what I'm doing working in it security
[23:39] and it security is a fascinating field
[23:41] but uh Bitcoin is better and bigger and
[23:45] and cooler and this is the the bigger
[23:48] thing that will impact bit will impact
[23:50] the world in a major way and just from
[23:53] like one and a half years now working or
[23:55] like working in Bitcoin I'm only doing
[23:58] not even even for a full year I'm coming
[24:00] up on my full year I'm like 11 months
[24:01] now full-time in Bitcoin uh but this
[24:04] just completely changed my life and I
[24:06] think it will uh change uh uh all our
[24:11] lives that work inside of Bitcoin and
[24:13] are as close as possible on bitcoin
[24:16] sorry for my small tangent but I think
[24:17] that's it's a really good point what you
[24:19] made yeah yeah absolutely and actually
[24:22] uh um Michael dunworth said to me
[24:25] recently um he came to our Meetup and uh
[24:29] he said you know what would you you know
[24:31] how would you feel if there was no
[24:32] Bitcoin what would you do you know and
[24:34] of course it's it's hard difficult to
[24:36] answer that um but yeah it would uh it
[24:40] would mean I I wouldn't have uh made the
[24:43] time to understand what money is and
[24:46] this uh absolute scam that we've been
[24:49] living through so yeah it's um it really
[24:53] absolutely changes everything and it
[24:55] becomes the most important problem and
[24:57] solution right
[24:59] so um actually even Einstein uh you know
[25:04] I think he would have valued Bitcoin but
[25:06] you know he he actually um had this
[25:10] quote which was compound interest is the
[25:12] eighth wonder of the world he who
[25:14] understands it earns it he who doesn't
[25:16] pays it I love that yeah and it's
[25:20] because of how small gains build on them
[25:22] themselves over time and Bitcoin Works
[25:25] in a similar way you know not through
[25:27] trai traditional interest but through
[25:29] exponential adoption and it's the
[25:32] network effect of you know more people
[25:35] and institutions using Bitcoin which
[25:37] compounds its value and when you huddle
[25:39] you benefit from this
[25:41] growth the longer you stay in the
[25:43] greater the rewards I didn't knew about
[25:45] the second part of the quote I always
[25:47] knew about compound interest is the
[25:49] eighth wonder of the world like that
[25:51] that is was pretty known in my head but
[25:53] I didn't knew at all about the he who
[25:57] understands it earns it you doesn't Pace
[25:59] it that that's brilliant like that I
[26:02] love that so much and and I I never
[26:04] heard it before like that's that's
[26:06] interesting yeah yeah he would have been
[26:08] a Bitcoin Max here
[26:11] again um cool let's take a little look
[26:15] at the history of ledgers and money and
[26:17] a lot of bitcoiners will probably have a
[26:19] good understanding of this but I think
[26:21] it's important to understand the uh
[26:24] history of money and and what makes a
[26:26] good money because that's the only way
[26:28] to really get an appreciation of um the
[26:32] power of Bitcoin and and how important
[26:34] it is so we'll just uh ZIP through this
[26:37] pretty pretty quickly um humans started
[26:40] living together about 13,000 years ago
[26:42] in modern day Israel and and Jordan and
[26:45] they started trading uh together um you
[26:48] know wool wood wheat and for that
[26:51] trading um how do they do it well they
[26:54] they would have maintained the records
[26:55] in their mind right because you can
[26:58] trust your small circle your s small
[27:00] Social Circle within your own village
[27:02] and you know that that's easy to trade
[27:04] that way so the trust is really
[27:07] maintained within with within everyone's
[27:09] mind in the in the village but if you
[27:11] wanted to trade with another Village
[27:13] there was no trust there so that's where
[27:17] writing was invented and it was invented
[27:19] 5,000 years ago not to communicate but
[27:22] to maintain a record and to maintain a a
[27:25] ledger of transactions and from here
[27:28] about 2 and a half thousand years ago
[27:30] gold coins were invented and this was
[27:32] the thing that allowed you to trust
[27:34] someone far
[27:36] away uh because gold was authentic and
[27:40] you could trust gold and then after that
[27:42] about 12200 years ago paper currency was
[27:45] invented and paper currency was backed
[27:48] by gold or silver or a commodity and you
[27:51] know that paper currency would be
[27:53] recognizable you'd have to obviously
[27:55] recognize it to to understand that and
[27:58] from here you had the medich an Italian
[28:00] family who invented Banking and what is
[28:02] banking banking really is just a ledger
[28:05] and it keeps a record of who paid what
[28:07] and how much money each customer has
[28:09] stored in the bank and modern day
[28:11] banking is just a ledger a big
[28:14] complicated database and of course
[28:16] originally the USD US dollar was backed
[28:19] by gold and they had the uh the gold
[28:21] stamp for where you could redeem this
[28:23] note for gold but just over 50 years ago
[28:27] in 1971 this gold backing was removed
[28:30] and the US and every currency in the
[28:32] world uh 160 currencies moved to
[28:35] something called the Fiat standard and
[28:37] so currencies were no longer backed by
[28:39] gold and they were just printed and I'm
[28:42] sure as you all agree Robin this
[28:44] experiment is absolutely failing and
[28:46] it's it it's finishing and it's it's
[28:48] been an absolute catastrophe uh and it's
[28:51] made everything more expensive uh and
[28:53] made life more
[28:55] difficult and and it was
[28:59] temporary no yeah that's right exactly
[29:02] and uh I mean I guess in some ways you
[29:06] could look at it and go well actually we
[29:08] we're unfortunate that we're living
[29:11] through this short blip right because
[29:14] it's only been just over 50 years you
[29:16] know but money hasn't always been that
[29:18] way so and I think you know over the
[29:21] coming years this experiment is going to
[29:23] wind down and Bitcoin is going to take
[29:24] over and in summary uh of course We have
[29:28] basically ledgers uh advancement in
[29:31] ledgers and advancement in money so we
[29:33] went from memory to writing to Banking
[29:36] and then ultimately to the Bitcoin
[29:38] Ledger Bitcoin is ledger
[29:40] 4.0 and in uh in money we went from
[29:44] coins to paper notes uh you know backed
[29:49] by Commodities and then to fiat currency
[29:53] and of course Bitcoin as money 4.0 so
[29:57] the fundamental way to think about
[29:59] Bitcoin is that it's a ledger and it's a
[30:00] perfect Ledger it's never been hacked
[30:02] and it's the ultimate in trust so
[30:04] there's trust coming up several times
[30:07] throughout those slides there now let's
[30:09] uh take a look at some numbers and the
[30:11] uh exponential growth that we are seeing
[30:14] so Bitcoin versus Fiat currencies and of
[30:17] course as we know Bitcoin is not a Fiat
[30:19] currencies but it can just help give
[30:21] some context as to uh you know how
[30:25] Bitcoin is doing on a on the glob stage
[30:28] so obviously the US dollar is the
[30:31] largest at almost $6 trillion and then
[30:34] you got the Euro the one the Yen and
[30:37] Bitcoin and Bitcoin has been hovering
[30:40] you know it's it's it's gone over the 2
[30:42] trillion recently and been hovering
[30:44] around that mount so yeah so it's it's
[30:47] massive right it's amaz it's it's
[30:50] fascinating that that Bitcoin is already
[30:52] so strong uh in in just like 15 16 years
[30:56] of of development and I I I feel like we
[30:59] will jump over United States dollars uh
[31:02] quicker as as you could imagine it's
[31:05] it's it's way closer than like gold like
[31:08] gold is I think like uh uh like
[31:12] 20 yeah like about 20 is like about 10x
[31:15] from here uh so and uh US USD is just
[31:21] like three x from here like two and a
[31:23] half X from here oh oh that's I love
[31:26] that also that's it's a great r great
[31:28] chart that I I think I showed them
[31:30] sometimes in the podcast also yeah yeah
[31:33] absolutely you know that was a great
[31:34] segue by yourself because um yeah there
[31:37] you can see gold is almost 20 trillion
[31:39] now um and of course you've got the mag
[31:41] seven uh companies there uh in worth
[31:44] their trillions and so Bitcoin has you
[31:46] know recently surpassed silver which was
[31:48] 1.6
[31:49] trillion um you know we were all waiting
[31:51] for that you know a couple of years ago
[31:54] and uh and then it's hot on the heels of
[31:56] Amazon Google Microsoft Nvidia
[32:00] Apple so and actually yeah when Bitcoin
[32:04] does reach Gold's market cap um if so
[32:07] that would be a 20 trillion uh market
[32:10] cap so we'd be looking at around about
[32:11] $1 million per Bitcoin at that point
[32:13] yeah it's it's interesting because uh
[32:17] probably it will be even higher because
[32:20] the US dollar will devalue uh in in that
[32:23] period of time depending on when we hit
[32:25] it but I think if Bitcoin hits a million
[32:28] gold will probably also have still like
[32:31] gained some some value over time so it
[32:34] will probably like be like 1.5 million
[32:36] but yeah like around that that price
[32:37] Target vehicle from from now um which is
[32:41] super interesting also one thing I just
[32:44] want to note here it's it's so crazy
[32:47] that Bitcoin is still smaller than some
[32:50] comp
[32:51] companies yeah people will look back in
[32:54] like 10 20 years and look at that Chanel
[32:57] like wow
[32:58] Bitcoin was smaller than a company like
[33:01] like that will be so outrageous and now
[33:05] it's so normal but it will be so
[33:07] outrageous uh I I can't wait to to to to
[33:12] tell people like oh I was in Bitcoin
[33:15] before it overtook the biggest company
[33:18] of the world like that will be a huge
[33:20] fundamental moment uh and uh I'm I'm
[33:24] just so glad to be alive at at that
[33:28] historic uh time phase where money got
[33:31] involved evolved so so big so like uh
[33:34] that that's just incredible for me yeah
[33:38] yep yep
[33:39] absolutely yeah there's even yeah even
[33:42] people getting into Bitcoin now I mean
[33:44] there's just so much ahead and yeah
[33:46] we'll be looking back over the next 10
[33:49] 20 30 years it's um it really is
[33:51] incredible
[33:53] yep um and of course you know Bitcoin
[33:56] becoming that glob
[33:59] money right um I mean that's when it
[34:03] just goes beyond any company in
[34:06] existence dwarf anything like that if we
[34:10] look at a few charts briefly um bitcoin
[34:13] price has actually um over the last 10
[34:15] years so a lot of these slides have got
[34:17] these percentages so this one says 84%
[34:20] so bitcoin's price has been increasing
[34:22] at a rate of 84% on average every year
[34:26] um that's its uh compound annual growth
[34:28] rate or kager so again you can see
[34:33] increasing
[34:34] fast um of course there's a you you've
[34:38] probably um I'm sure spoken about the
[34:41] power law and things like that on on on
[34:43] your show I'm sure um I mean look
[34:47] there's lots of power laws um including
[34:49] you know wealth distribution and
[34:51] internet connectivity and you
[34:54] know Bitcoin actually follows a power
[34:56] law uh and has been you know very very
[34:58] closely and it doesn't guarantee it's
[35:00] going to continue on that path but um
[35:02] it's just quite fascinating that it has
[35:05] been um and we take a look at the number
[35:11] of Bitcoin wallets uh this is actually
[35:13] been increasing at a rate of 29% over
[35:17] the last 10
[35:19] years all of these slides are just
[35:21] basically it's just highlighting just
[35:23] the exponential growth rate of Bitcoin
[35:25] uh number of Bitcoin users uh this is
[35:28] not probably an exact science it's
[35:30] difficult to know exactly how many
[35:31] Bitcoin users there are but you know
[35:33] there's some great analysis out there by
[35:36] different people and yeah it's estimated
[35:40] this has been growing at a rate of
[35:42] 29% um uh per year since 2012 actually
[35:47] um around about 118 million users at the
[35:50] moment yeah just on this point I mean
[35:53] when obviously we know bitcoin's uh
[35:56] Supply ual is decreasing so we've got
[35:59] the supply
[36:00] decreasing uh and then when you have
[36:02] demand increasing for the economists out
[36:05] there you know when demand is increasing
[36:08] Supply is decreasing what what happens
[36:10] and we know that very well but you you
[36:12] you have a supply shock basically um and
[36:15] that's evident by what we see in all
[36:18] these growth rates so also the decentral
[36:22] decentralization of Bitcoin also
[36:24] increasing um evident by the number of
[36:26] nodes
[36:28] uh that's been increasing at a rate of
[36:30] around
[36:32] 177% uh that's over the past 8 years for
[36:34] that data I run a few nodes myself um I
[36:37] know a bunch of people who do and
[36:39] encourage everyone to run their own node
[36:41] it's pretty easy these days and and fun
[36:43] the energy uh so for the proof of work
[36:47] the the miners um that has been
[36:50] increasing at a rate of
[36:52] 12% um I think we're currently using
[36:56] around about 19.4 G gwatt which is you
[36:59] know around about 20 nuclear power
[37:00] plants and um that will continue to
[37:04] increase as well um Diamond hands or
[37:07] hodlers in terms of or otherwise known
[37:09] as the long-term holders lths they have
[37:12] been inre increasing as well um a
[37:13] long-term holder uh is usually defined
[37:16] as someone who has kept their Bitcoin or
[37:20] hasn't moved their Bitcoin for at least
[37:23] 155 days and that's been increasing as
[37:26] well depending on when you're you look
[37:27] at it but this is over the last 10 years
[37:30] this has been increasing at a rate of
[37:32] 4% transactions also increasing that's
[37:35] such an amazing point of like the
[37:37] long-term hardless because this just
[37:40] shows the on term uh data of like H how
[37:44] many Bitcoin are not moved but uh I
[37:47] don't know about you but I've I've been
[37:50] in Bitcoin now since four almost five
[37:52] years now uh and I have moved my Bitcoin
[37:56] and different s custody
[37:58] Solutions I think three four five times
[38:02] uh because I started with a simple
[38:06] Ledger uh and as Bitcoin value grew and
[38:09] my allocation to bitcoin I up leveled up
[38:14] my
[38:15] security uh inside of Bitcoin more and
[38:18] more each year uh so I moved my Bitcoin
[38:24] and from an onter perspective it it
[38:26] looks like like he sold all his Bitcoin
[38:29] maybe to not address because I moved
[38:32] them
[38:33] regularly um but actually uh they're all
[38:36] in my possession and I just upgraded my
[38:39] security level to another solution so uh
[38:42] if if you're add those long-term hotler
[38:46] that uh because they are clever upgrade
[38:49] their Security Solutions and maybe then
[38:51] have a different address or have to move
[38:53] to bitcoin somewhere else they're not
[38:55] encountered uh uh accounted for in that
[38:59] uh that scenario I think because it's
[39:01] like once you move it um the the
[39:03] long-term hotess is like okay like they
[39:05] the other sold moved it so uh it I think
[39:09] that statistics probably is like even
[39:12] bigger of like people that will not move
[39:15] them so that's that's a great aspect of
[39:18] that yeah absolutely 100% agree yeah all
[39:21] of this stuff um you know it's it's
[39:23] definitely not an exact science but it
[39:25] can kind of give us Direction but yeah I
[39:28] totally agree cuz I'm a similar
[39:30] situation to you uh you know when you're
[39:32] in Bitcoin and you're constantly
[39:34] learning about better security models
[39:36] you you you can't help but you know
[39:38] upgrade and um do what you can do what
[39:41] you can to keep ahead um also the uh
[39:45] transactions uh been increasing as well
[39:47] at a rate of about 14% per year um this
[39:51] is about the uh essentially the Bitcoin
[39:54] ETFs so actually this is just a kind of
[39:57] a
[39:58] z um narrowed down to Black Rock's gold
[40:01] ETF versus their Bitcoin ETF um and it's
[40:05] just incredible see it it took gold 20
[40:08] years to reach $35 billion in assets so
[40:11] this is the um I think it's called IU
[40:14] which is the you black rock gold
[40:16] ETF um Bitcoin did that in under a year
[40:20] you know so the Bitcoin ETF was approved
[40:22] early last year and look at that I mean
[40:25] the Bitcoin is just you know ver
[40:27] compared to to gold so um you know
[40:30] Bitcoin smashed past gold early in
[40:32] November so it's just that one slide
[40:36] there shows you um just the incredible
[40:39] appetite for it and the unprecedented
[40:40] Pace that Bitcoin is growing that's un
[40:44] like I never saw like I never saw that
[40:47] that's crazy that the black Ro gold ETF
[40:51] is already like half the size of of the
[40:55] Bitcoin black Bitcoin ETF that's wow I
[41:00] never heard that statistic that's crazy
[41:02] yeah yeah it's cool to see it look you
[41:04] know that one and there are other gold
[41:05] ETFs and I think you know overall I
[41:07] think maybe gold is still ahead if you
[41:09] put them all together but like I mean
[41:11] Bitcoin is just um it's going to
[41:13] overtake very very soon so yeah I'd be
[41:16] interested actually to see some data on
[41:18] on that on the overall
[41:21] picture um fastest to 1 trillion so took
[41:24] Microsoft 44 years to reach $1 trillion
[41:27] market cap Apple 42 years Amazon 24
[41:31] years Google 21 years and Bitcoin took
[41:34] 12
[41:36] years so again also everything is just
[41:39] speeding up and Bitcoin is the best
[41:43] performing asset so um this chart's
[41:48] quite detailed but just in summary um
[41:51] you know Bitcoin has outperformed every
[41:53] other asset class by a massive margin
[41:57] and and uh the cumulative return for
[42:00] Bitcoin from 2011 to 2024 is over 21
[42:03] million per. there's the 21 number again
[42:06] it's just massive right um the
[42:09] annualized return is about is close to
[42:11] 150% and if you compare that to
[42:13] traditional Investments like the NASDAQ
[42:16] 100 which has been one of the best
[42:18] performing stock indices that returned
[42:21] nearly 900% of course no nowhere close
[42:24] to the 21 million per so um and gold
[42:27] actually only returned 50 about 55% so
[42:32] um and then of course you know Bitcoin
[42:34] did have some major draw Downs um it's
[42:37] the you know green green red green green
[42:39] red um that we all know about 2014 2018
[42:43] 2022 yet it continues to outpace every
[42:45] asset over the long run so again the uh
[42:48] the diamond hands are
[42:51] rewarded the hotas and we're in the the
[42:54] third um 2095 is the third green year
[42:57] right that's that's that's the uh the
[43:00] third consecutive green
[43:03] year do you think that I mean that's a
[43:06] impossible question but like do do you
[43:08] think that this cycle will actually
[43:11] continue uh or do we have a Breaking
[43:13] Point with like scurve adoption with
[43:16] like where where this adoption cycle
[43:18] actually really spikes off and we see
[43:21] those massive I mean we already in a
[43:23] quite exponential growth R but at some
[43:26] point it's just like
[43:27] that that uh steep curve of the option
[43:30] that we saw with the folding of the
[43:33] paper where the price just doesn't fall
[43:36] because Bitcoin is adopted so quickly
[43:38] and diminishing returns is kind of out
[43:40] of the
[43:41] window yeah yeah I think yeah I I I
[43:45] still think we probably get like a
[43:46] blowoff top somewhere you know and
[43:48] that's when that you know that
[43:50] exponential that that that Mania kicks
[43:52] off and but maybe the uh maybe the um
[43:57] the draw Downs are not as massive you
[44:00] know as previous times um but I think
[44:03] you know Bitcoin is is obviously you
[44:05] know built on these fouryear cycles and
[44:08] it's uh you know it's mathematical you
[44:11] know it's
[44:12] um it's that's still there that's not
[44:14] going to change and I think naturally we
[44:18] do go through these booms and busts so
[44:21] yeah I I don't know nobody knows when
[44:24] it's going to occur right the next bare
[44:26] Market but
[44:27] who knows I mean it does feel very
[44:29] different you know this is probably my
[44:30] is it my third proper sort of cycle this
[44:34] one does feel very quite different you
[44:36] know with the massive players getting
[44:39] involved and you know and and on the
[44:41] political stage as well you know
[44:43] bitcoin's part of the macro conversation
[44:44] now which it never really was before
[44:47] yeah it's amazing to to see that Bitcoin
[44:48] is in all the conversations now we we
[44:51] have it on company level nation state
[44:52] level uh pleb level we have it on every
[44:55] possible level and it's
[44:57] everywhere that that in that alone is
[45:00] just crazy yeah yep y absolutely and uh
[45:05] speaking of of you know speaking of
[45:08] Bitcoin on that level there's there's a
[45:10] lot of talk about crypto as well right
[45:12] and I thought it's look I I I really
[45:14] believe there's no absolutely no
[45:16] comparison between the two and I think
[45:17] it's ridiculous to even compare them
[45:19] right but um you know we have to
[45:22] acknowledge that crypto is a thing out
[45:25] there and it you know is getting thrown
[45:26] around a lot especially for those who
[45:29] probably don't uh fully understand what
[45:31] Bitcoin is so I thought it' be worth
[45:33] just having a having a few slides
[45:36] around um what Bitcoin should be
[45:40] considered as and how it's so different
[45:42] to crypto and I think um uh great we
[45:47] really need to look at Bitcoin as a
[45:48] protocol um and this is nothing new you
[45:51] know this is and if we just take a
[45:53] little look at the protocols
[45:57] the fundamental Protocols of the
[45:58] internet um we have obviously browsers
[46:01] use
[46:02] HTTP uh VoIP for calling uh SMTP for um
[46:08] email SSL for security encryption
[46:11] security uh DNS for translating our IP
[46:15] addresses FTP for file transfer protocol
[46:18] uh and then we of course TC TCP IP which
[46:21] many people will have heard of um which
[46:24] forms the foundation of you know the
[46:27] basically data exchange and and routing
[46:29] and of course the final piece of the
[46:31] puzzle for the internet
[46:33] was this one here in Orange for money
[46:36] you know we've never actually had a
[46:38] protocol for money and uh that's always
[46:41] been missing the missing protocol um for
[46:45] the internet and of course we've tried
[46:47] to um you know package up the Fiat
[46:51] system to work with the internet but the
[46:53] Fiat system is not digital you know and
[46:56] the been so many problems and you know
[47:00] Bitcoin is the protocol for money just
[47:04] as you know HTTP is a protocol for
[47:06] browsing Bitcoin is the the protocol for
[47:09] Value transfer and digital
[47:10] scarcity um
[47:13] and you
[47:15] know Protocols are permanent once a
[47:17] protocol reaches Mass adoption it
[47:19] doesn't get replaced it becomes like the
[47:22] infrastructure you know no one talks
[47:23] about oh you know are we going to
[47:25] replace tcpip or DNS because you know
[47:28] they they're really the foundation of
[47:30] the internet and and Bitcoin has reached
[47:32] this stage for money and and value
[47:34] exchange so um what is web 3 you
[47:38] probably hear a lot about web 3
[47:40] especially in the crypto world but yes
[47:42] web web 3 is a thing we started off with
[47:45] web 1 which is basically the early
[47:47] internet which was static websites users
[47:50] could consume content um you know blogs
[47:52] and news sites and things like that then
[47:54] we went to web 2 which was you know read
[47:57] and write and that's like Facebook
[48:00] YouTube that's where you could create
[48:01] your own content and and share and
[48:03] interact with others but of course these
[48:05] big platforms they own the data right so
[48:08] that was the centralized control of big
[48:10] Tech and then web 3 uh and really
[48:14] Bitcoin was the pioneer of of web 3 and
[48:16] that's where you could read write but
[48:18] also own your own data and I think
[48:22] actually a you know a great example of
[48:26] web 3 these days is nosta right um
[48:29] you've got which uses the public private
[48:31] key cryptography as does Bitcoin uh but
[48:34] it's where you own your own digital
[48:37] asset your own digital identity
[48:39] especially in the case of nosta uh if
[48:41] you're using you know Twitter uh you
[48:43] don't own that data um whereas with
[48:46] nosta you've got your own keys and you
[48:49] know whatever you publish you own you
[48:51] take that with you uh and you can also
[48:53] verify your own identity so Bitcoin is
[48:56] is the monetary layout of web 3 it's
[48:59] decentralized sensorship resistant um
[49:02] and unlike other you know classic web 3
[49:05] projects that gets thrown about out
[49:07] there Bitcoin is truly decentralized
[49:09] it's so interesting how web free got
[49:13] such a bad name because of all the
[49:16] crypto scams and because of all the
[49:19] crypto things and because if if
[49:23] someone like I'm on bitcoin conferences
[49:26] I'm on on sometimes even like blockchain
[49:28] conferences but like rarely but usually
[49:30] I'm on bitcoin only conferences um and
[49:34] there are sometimes also crypto people
[49:36] that don't like Bitcoin that much uh
[49:39] just because they know the leaders of
[49:41] also crypto are into Bitcoin and they
[49:44] also in those conferences and they come
[49:46] up to me like oh I have this really
[49:48] interesting web free blockchain and they
[49:51] use a lot of those uh buzzwords usually
[49:54] within the first minute or two minutes
[49:56] of that pitch when they want to be on
[49:58] the podcast and if someone uses either
[50:03] of those uh things of like web free
[50:05] crypto blockchain I usually am very
[50:08] cautious with even talking to them I'm
[50:10] like oh you probably have some scram
[50:12] coin going on um there are some ex ex
[50:16] exceptions of that of course uh but it's
[50:20] it's we I think we need a new name for
[50:22] web
[50:23] free stink it with too too too much with
[50:26] in a bad way but I do like that we have
[50:30] kind of the internet layer and then we
[50:32] put Bitcoin there and Bitcoin is kind of
[50:34] making it possible to own our data with
[50:37] like Nostra with the monetary layer with
[50:40] all those things I I do like that and
[50:43] that's a vision of web free that I can
[50:45] subscribe towards uh and uh
[50:50] yeah I just hope we can wash clean the
[50:53] name of web free or find a new one yeah
[50:56] yeah yeah yeah I think the the key issue
[50:58] lies in the decentralization and you
[51:00] know these crypto projects um they
[51:03] they're not decentralized right I mean
[51:06] you know Bitcoin is the only real true
[51:09] uh piece of decentralization that we
[51:11] have so yeah they can they can they can
[51:14] say that they're web three and and you
[51:16] know I appreciate what they're trying to
[51:17] do but you really have to build it on
[51:19] bitcoin you know um I mean and and of
[51:22] course the internet you know um is
[51:24] mostly decentralized and has been as
[51:26] well but
[51:27] and actually another way of looking at
[51:29] it um
[51:32] so is we can look at the difference
[51:36] between products and protocols and why
[51:38] Protocols are fundamental and
[51:40] longlasting so we're all familiar with
[51:43] uh browsers like Chrome and Safari and
[51:46] Edge and then different mobile operating
[51:48] systems Android and
[51:50] iOS uh different search so Google uh
[51:54] bing and now even AI such as chat
[51:57] gbt um and the important thing to note
[52:01] about you know products is that products
[52:04] are temporary and they're driven by
[52:06] competition and Innovation and they can
[52:09] be replaced and will be replaced
[52:11] constantly whereas when you look at uh
[52:14] protocols they're the foundation of
[52:16] communication and systems so of course
[52:18] language English um obviously all the
[52:20] other languages um number
[52:24] systems communication system systems TCP
[52:28] IP wasn't you know the only one but it's
[52:31] obviously the one that has uh
[52:33] successfully won in terms of
[52:35] communication and then for money we a
[52:38] protocol for money and of course that is
[52:41] Bitcoin and so Bitcoin is not a product
[52:44] like other cryptocurrencies you know and
[52:46] so we're putting crypto is basically
[52:49] products right um there and Bitcoin is
[52:53] money it's it's permanent and it forms
[52:57] infrastructure and these products build
[53:00] on top of
[53:01] protocols so you know crypto exists but
[53:05] in reality it all exists on top of
[53:08] Bitcoin and that's how it will you know
[53:11] continue moving forward and protocols
[53:13] don't get replaced they they endure
[53:16] right and of course crypto products
[53:18] you've got many you've got thousands I I
[53:20] think I I mean that God I don't know how
[53:23] many millions of crypto
[53:26] Crypt out there yeah it's hard to put a
[53:29] number on there uh because they are so
[53:33] many and they it's just like I don't
[53:36] know like I wouldn't even I wouldn't
[53:39] even start to count them yeah yeah and
[53:43] you know there's going to be many many
[53:44] more and it's justone bananas right and
[53:47] then of course protocols well bitcoin's
[53:49] obviously had some small competition but
[53:52] none of them have been successful
[53:54] Bitcoin has easily won that and will win
[53:57] that I mean Bitcoin is the invention or
[54:00] some say the discovery of uh digital
[54:03] scarcity and once that's discovered you
[54:06] know the genie is out of the out of the
[54:08] bottle you know it can't be discovered
[54:11] again you know it's some people refer to
[54:14] it as it's like the invention of the
[54:17] wheel you know you you can't make the
[54:19] wheel more round or you can't make a
[54:21] better wheel you know
[54:23] it's that's
[54:26] you you cannot make the the wheel more
[54:29] round and that that's why Bitcoin is you
[54:32] cannot make Bitcoin better i i l that a
[54:35] lot yep yep and obviously the deeper you
[54:40] dive down the rabbit hole the the more
[54:42] that really sinks in and of course
[54:45] crypto we got so many products stable
[54:46] coins shitcoins nfts there's meme coins
[54:50] security coins the list goes on
[54:53] right
[54:55] um and you've got a whole bunch of
[54:57] shitcoins as we like to say they really
[55:01] are shitcoins uh they're about pump and
[55:03] dumps they're about making money some
[55:05] people want to make more Bitcoin you've
[55:07] got a whole bunch of just bad technology
[55:09] projects and you've probably got a small
[55:11] Slither of successful Tech projects that
[55:14] may come out of
[55:15] this and I think one of those uh in the
[55:18] sort of short to medium term is is uh
[55:21] stable coins and I think there's
[55:22] definitely some potential for for more
[55:24] growth there especially with the likes
[55:26] of you know tether being built on
[55:29] Lightning for for example I think that's
[55:31] that's pretty cool and and it makes
[55:33] sense to build all these products
[55:35] because I would suggest that stable
[55:37] coins are a product as well they're not
[55:38] a protocol but all of these products
[55:42] will be built on bitcoin right Bitcoin
[55:45] is the
[55:46] infrastructure and uh so stable coins
[55:50] they've been growing at a rate of about
[55:52] 35% uh over the last few years and I
[55:55] think we're going to see that probably
[55:57] take off in a in an exponential way as
[55:59] well and if you if you compare stable
[56:02] coins to say PayPal or VISA um it's
[56:06] actually I mean stable coins the there's
[56:09] lots of numbers out there but I think
[56:11] the stable coin volume in 2023 was about
[56:13] nearly 11 trillion and
[56:17] Visa is you know about 11.6 trillion so
[56:20] it's there's not a lot of difference
[56:22] there's stable coins there on the chart
[56:25] growing very fast
[56:27] um and it it makes sense right because I
[56:29] mean if you think about the U in terms
[56:31] of the global Consciousness um you know
[56:34] mo you know I I'd expect that most
[56:37] people know the US dollar you know the
[56:39] US is the the global
[56:41] superpower um so people are going to
[56:46] trust the US dollar more than Bitcoin
[56:47] that's that's just the reality we of
[56:49] course we know that's absolutely not the
[56:51] case um but that's I think how you know
[56:57] if US US dollar stable coins continue
[57:00] growing around the world and people have
[57:02] easier access then naturally that's I
[57:04] think people will demand that uh and
[57:07] demand payment in you know US dollar
[57:11] stable coins but over time the it'll
[57:14] help them to learn about Bitcoin as well
[57:17] and and as the US dollar continues to uh
[57:21] inflate and debase they're going to see
[57:24] Bitcoin continue to climb and you know
[57:27] it won't be it won't be long until
[57:29] people will rather accept Bitcoin rather
[57:32] than a US dollar stable coin because it
[57:34] be like what you know it's like Fiat
[57:36] currencies they're like hot potatoes
[57:38] right you you don't want to hold the the
[57:40] fiat currency for too long uh it's
[57:42] particularly the ones that are hyper
[57:43] inflating so you may as well just take
[57:45] the hard asset so all those people
[57:47] arguing about Bitcoin not being used for
[57:50] payments I think you know it's it's not
[57:52] here right now but it's it will come
[57:55] absolutely Ely yeah and and and I count
[57:59] there's always like those Bitcoin
[58:00] dominance charts and I exclude stable
[58:04] coins from that because I think stable
[58:06] coins are pure
[58:09] feared they are like I know all crypto
[58:12] are feat but like stable coins are pure
[58:14] feat for me that there is not not even a
[58:16] discussion if it's crypto um so like
[58:20] yeah stable coins is just an live
[58:23] extension of of the fat currencies and
[58:26] and uh they will make it a little bit
[58:27] longer that they around so they can
[58:30] trade on bank holidays also and stuff
[58:32] like that but there this is just a it's
[58:35] like the what was it called the Blu-ray
[58:38] disc like the Blu-ray technology that
[58:41] people are like oh like that's so
[58:42] fundamentally great and then like
[58:44] everything became digital and then
[58:45] you're like yeah Blu-ray nobody needs
[58:47] and nobody heard about Blu-ray yeah
[58:50] that's right it was just a small blip in
[58:52] time really I do remember when I was
[58:54] young yeah some you know friends of ours
[58:57] had Blu-ray players and yeah they
[58:59] they're kind of you know had a tiny
[59:02] popularity for a little while but yeah
[59:03] it didn't seem to last for that long
[59:05] because as you say you know the digital
[59:07] Revolution really took off and um you
[59:11] know um
[59:12] that's that's what we're seeing with
[59:15] Bitcoin right I mean money has not been
[59:18] digitized until now and it's one of the
[59:20] last major things to be digitized so
[59:23] absolutely
[59:24] um so so
[59:27] um heresy and measurement um actually I
[59:31] think this has been discussed on on on
[59:33] your podcast before uh I I think and
[59:35] it's I think it's quite a fascinating uh
[59:37] topic to look at so heresy is the the
[59:41] belief or opinion A belief or opinion
[59:43] profoundly at odds with what is
[59:45] generally accepted and throughout
[59:47] history every revolutionary truth has
[59:49] come with a price paid in resistance
[59:52] ridicule and often personal sacrifice
[59:55] and we call these people Heretics not
[59:56] because they were wrong but because they
[59:58] were too right um they were right too
[60:00] soon and
[60:01] um uh let's just have a little explore
[60:04] how this patent repeats and why Bitcoin
[60:06] fits right into it so actually the the
[60:09] image on here is the printing press and
[60:10] that this is a great example because uh
[60:13] it's one of history's most disruptive
[60:14] inventions and before it existed
[60:17] knowledge was tightly controlled and
[60:19] books were handwritten they were rare
[60:21] and monopolized by religious and
[60:24] political Elites um it's it's hard to
[60:26] believe that there was a time when you
[60:28] it was difficult for the average person
[60:30] to get any knowledge right we all have
[60:32] that at our fingertips now um but of
[60:35] course the gutenberg's Press which was
[60:37] from around the 1440s changed that and
[60:40] suddenly ideas could spread
[60:42] faster then authorities could actually
[60:44] control but of course with that power
[60:47] came backlash and people were you know
[60:50] executed for publishing ideas that
[60:52] challenged the dominant narrative so
[60:56] truth tellers have always faced
[60:59] resistance um and there's many different
[61:01] measurements and you know why does this
[61:04] pattern repeat because every major Leap
[61:06] Forward starts with the same thing it's
[61:08] it's a new way to measure reality and
[61:10] you know there there's been lots of
[61:12] these with astronomy and the telescope
[61:14] obviously um before the telescope people
[61:17] believed the UN Universe revolved around
[61:19] the earth and Galileo's telescope showed
[61:22] that that that wasn't true and the
[61:25] result of that was he was was labeled a
[61:26] heretic and placed under house arrest so
[61:30] seeing new truths doesn't always
[61:32] guarantee acceptance but it often
[61:35] triggers fear and denial
[61:37] first and there's been plenty of these
[61:41] the
[61:42] microscope um in physics the pendulum in
[61:47] chemistry uh the balance and in medicine
[61:50] the thermometer and believe it or not
[61:52] when the ther thermometer uh came out
[61:54] you know doctors felt that they could
[61:56] actually measure the temperature better
[61:58] with their hands you know what was this
[62:01] thermometer what really yeah like I'm so
[62:06] bad of of guessing
[62:09] temperature yeah right yeah I mean every
[62:11] one of these um faced resistance um the
[62:15] electrical engineering was a
[62:18] galvanometer uh the computer science uh
[62:21] the early computers you know when when
[62:23] um these you know new calculating
[62:26] devices you know were were released um
[62:30] you know people would say you know but
[62:33] the mind is is more accurate than a
[62:35] computer and and why create this
[62:37] computer when there are so many Minds
[62:38] out there you know their minds can
[62:41] already do
[62:42] this and then of course uh you know
[62:46] Bitcoin as as we know has faced plenty
[62:49] of resistance and continues to it's been
[62:51] dismissed as a fad a scam or a threat
[62:53] and um economists cling into old models
[62:56] and they're resistant to bitcoin's
[63:00] Paradigm shifting
[63:01] potential and uh you know for thousands
[63:04] of years economics has lacked a true
[63:07] inst instrument to measure
[63:09] value but Bitcoin is that instrument
[63:11] it's perfect decentralized Money free
[63:13] from
[63:15] manipulation uh and Bitcoin really is
[63:17] where science collides with economics
[63:21] so so history shows us that I guess
[63:25] every breakthrough starts as
[63:27] heresy but what was once heresy
[63:29] eventually becomes obvious and you know
[63:32] as it is to us and Bitcoin is following
[63:35] that same path that's amazing I love
[63:38] that that's that that that truly shows
[63:42] uh I mean I
[63:46] have people will laugh at me if I bring
[63:49] my vacuum cleaner again up in the
[63:51] podcast uh but I will do it I I I got a
[63:53] robot vacuum cleaner and I was long
[63:56] skeptical of like like how good will it
[63:58] actually work and like does it actually
[64:00] good job in cleaning the house and stuff
[64:02] like that and then like and I was like
[64:04] okay like let's just buy it test it and
[64:07] I can actually send it back after like a
[64:08] week if it doesn't do a good job uh so I
[64:11] had it myself and now actually when I
[64:13] tell people like oh like I don't vacuum
[64:15] my house anymore like it's just cleaned
[64:18] by a robot and it costed me €600 and I
[64:21] got like each week like one two hours of
[64:24] my life back uh and and it's really
[64:26] great like there are maybe like five
[64:29] spots in in in the whole floor that I
[64:31] have to H quickly do with a hand vacuum
[64:34] and it takes me about two minutes to to
[64:37] do that and uh the rest of it is just
[64:40] automated uh and people like no it will
[64:43] go broke quickly H it will not do a good
[64:46] job it like you you still have to
[64:48] maintain the robot and like people come
[64:51] up with with weird excuses why
[64:54] Innovation will not work when it clearly
[64:57] does and the same thing on a bigger
[64:59] level of electricity on internet and
[65:01] Bitcoin uh people really want to
[65:05] preserve the state of art like right now
[65:08] like how however it is right now and
[65:11] don't go anywhere further and if if you
[65:14] want to lift the level up and you want
[65:16] to improve something um you have to show
[65:20] that you're perfect and 20x better uh
[65:24] and and only then you have to the chance
[65:26] to really bring innovation in there and
[65:29] uh that's what Bitcoin is bringing
[65:31] that's why it's so disruptive but people
[65:33] still have those uh resistance against
[65:36] it and we will always have it I I met uh
[65:39] a guy in in France from my far far
[65:43] family who was against the internet like
[65:45] two years ago and he still is he was
[65:48] like oh like the internet will be just a
[65:50] fat and it will go away and I was like
[65:52] he's talking that in like
[65:54] 2025 about
[65:56] people
[65:58] always Bitcoin like we can we can say
[66:01] goodbye to to that people will accept
[66:05] Bitcoin and they will love it they will
[66:07] always be opponents of innovation like
[66:11] always they will always be there we have
[66:13] to accept that that reality yep yep
[66:17] absolutely yeah it's incredible it
[66:19] really is and uh yeah I mean look I was
[66:22] obviously I was around before the
[66:23] internet kicked off as well so actually
[66:26] you know I've been through that kind of
[66:28] exponential takeoff too and um yeah
[66:32] actually I I I I want to reflect on that
[66:34] at some point too just go back over you
[66:37] know where I've been with that but it's
[66:39] um these things really do take off in a
[66:42] in that exponential way um and yeah
[66:45] actually you talk about vacuum cleaners
[66:47] um I think didn't I think I saw
[66:49] something about Lyn alen posted
[66:51] something about those recently it was
[66:52] quite interesting I can't remember all
[66:54] the details but um something along the
[66:56] lines of the fact that these these
[66:59] vacuum cleaners are you know it's not
[67:01] priced in um but they're not quite there
[67:04] yet but it's yeah they're growing right
[67:08] so um and they're doing fantastic Shob
[67:12] it's like uh you you you you they are
[67:15] scheduled when they do it that you can
[67:18] um there's always times when nobody's at
[67:20] home and then you can just schedule that
[67:21] and you come home and it's a clean home
[67:23] um like you small things like you drop
[67:27] small things on the floor like crumbles
[67:29] of Breads and stuff like that you
[67:30] literally take out your phone and say
[67:32] like clean this small area right here in
[67:34] the kitchen he comes cleans it and goes
[67:36] back and you never have to do
[67:39] anything it it's fascinating how quickly
[67:42] we adopt the same with jbt I don't
[67:46] Google anymore yeah I I I I just I'm in
[67:50] the process of processing the whole
[67:52] podcast and figuring out what we can
[67:53] learn from those 400 conversations I had
[67:56] and like figing out like articles and
[67:58] maybe like small books that I can
[68:00] publish around that uh and I just copied
[68:03] all the transcripts of all the podcasts
[68:05] put it in
[68:06] jbd uh and ask okay like what are the
[68:09] main topics what can we learn from that
[68:13] and I was like
[68:14] what that's that's such an incredible
[68:18] like the things that came out of chbd
[68:20] was like that's solid like that's real
[68:22] good like that that that's better than
[68:26] any intern that I could hire uh of like
[68:29] hey go through my podcast and figure out
[68:31] what we can learn from it not that's way
[68:32] better that's like uh on a on a sailor
[68:35] level good like AI is so good
[68:38] now and uh it it it really sorry for my
[68:43] time but it is really amazing to to see
[68:45] that growth yeah yeah absolutely and
[68:48] yeah and actually with h21 we're we're
[68:51] also using it uh a lot and more and more
[68:54] and looking how we can use it more and I
[68:56] think I mean you have to right it's it's
[68:58] it's there now right you have to use it
[69:00] cuz if you don't you'll be left behind
[69:02] and um it's good it's you know and then
[69:05] actually I was thinking about the
[69:06] vacuuming you know obviously these these
[69:08] robots right I mean they are coming too
[69:11] you know we see that on I see that on
[69:13] Twitter you see the videos of was it the
[69:15] Tesla you know ones that musk is
[69:17] bringing out um they're probably only a
[69:21] year or two away right where you can buy
[69:23] one of these and have that in your home
[69:25] doing everything for you folding your
[69:27] clothing putting your clothes away I
[69:28] mean everything you need I hope so like
[69:30] I since I have that Robot vacuum cleaner
[69:33] I'm like I don't want to fold clothes
[69:35] there has to be a robot for that or I
[69:37] don't want to put them in the washer
[69:39] like I don't want to put the dishes out
[69:41] of the dishwasher it feels like such a
[69:43] robot thing to do yeah yeah exactly
[69:46] interestingly my partner she actually
[69:48] loves vacuuming and that's why we don't
[69:50] have a robot vacuum cuz she really
[69:52] enjoys it so I don't know what we're
[69:54] going to do with it she'll be having
[69:55] fight with the the robot over the
[69:57] vacuuming I think so but this is the
[70:00] point where technology should bring us
[70:02] like not not to a fight but uh
[70:06] technology should bring us to the point
[70:08] where we can freely choose of what we
[70:09] want to do uh with our lives and with
[70:12] our time and of course you can also get
[70:16] extremely rich and just hire a bunch of
[70:18] servants in your house uh but like most
[70:21] people cannot do that and human D is the
[70:23] most valuable thing so we should not uh
[70:25] waste human time on those things but if
[70:28] you really like vacuuming you can do
[70:31] that and everything else the robot does
[70:33] uh that that that's fine so like we
[70:36] should go back to like what what we
[70:38] really want to do and uh use our brain
[70:43] power and our um life's energy to go
[70:47] tackle big problems of like okay how do
[70:49] we get to another planet how do we uh
[70:52] get um food in everyone's mouths in the
[70:55] whole world like how how do we solve the
[70:57] big problems of our world uh and not how
[71:01] do we sort
[71:04] dishes our things but if someone likes
[71:07] to vacuum like go ahead do it like that
[71:11] that's great and maybe it's a form of
[71:13] meditation that you want and need yep
[71:16] yeah and it makes me think this is where
[71:19] you need to embrace it and as you're you
[71:21] know talking about your embracing Ai and
[71:23] what you can do with it because if you
[71:25] don't embrace it I mean you're going to
[71:27] basically end up being a heretic right
[71:30] you're going to be someone who is Left
[71:33] Behind and um yeah that's just the way
[71:37] forward and same with Bitcoin right you
[71:40] need to embrace that Ai and Bitcoin I
[71:42] mean they're massive things right now
[71:45] so so um actually and this brings us to
[71:48] the last section which is the uh the
[71:50] prediction so after all that let's have
[71:53] a look a bit of a prediction ition so I
[71:56] predict Bitcoin in 10 years will be
[71:58] worth um over $53 trillion in market cap
[72:02] and that would be $2.5 million per
[72:04] Bitcoin and this is not too dis
[72:06] dissimilar to some other you know famous
[72:09] um uh predictions out there like
[72:12] sailor um a good way of looking at this
[72:16] is to look at you know let's take a look
[72:18] at all the Assets in the world right so
[72:19] if you add them all up you get you
[72:21] almost get uh one quadrillion so it's
[72:23] around about 992 tril
[72:26] so what makes up that you've got real
[72:28] estate uh at 430 trillion that's the
[72:32] biggest chunk then you've got bonds at
[72:35] 149 then money at 138 equities at 123
[72:40] oil at 122 trillion gold almost 20 uh
[72:45] medals 7 trillion art and collectibles
[72:48] at 2 trillion and then you've got little
[72:51] Bitcoin there at 2 trillion now you can
[72:53] take the glass half empty and say that's
[72:55] tiny look at Bitcoin but the glassa full
[72:59] um view is that 10 years ago Bitcoin was
[73:02] only worth around $200 per Bitcoin with
[73:06] a market cap of only 130 million now
[73:09] it's 2 trillion so that's a 15,000 x
[73:13] increase in just 10 years so where is it
[73:16] going to be in the next 10
[73:18] years and I think we often hear that you
[73:21] know software is eating the world but
[73:25] reality Bitcoin is eating Global capital
[73:28] and Bitcoin is going to monetize much of
[73:31] this Global Capital because it just
[73:32] makes sense right um I hear a lot about
[73:36] you know people selling out of real
[73:38] estate and moving into Bitcoin because
[73:41] they're going to make way more money and
[73:43] they can just sit back and you know and
[73:46] and huddle basically and you know do
[73:48] what they'd rather do with their
[73:51] time um so and of course as I mentioned
[73:54] before we live in a digital world where
[73:56] almost everything has been digitized
[73:58] communication music photography except
[74:01] for money we're still living on a Fiat
[74:04] standard we're still living in the
[74:05] analog world for money Bitcoin is
[74:09] currently worth about
[74:11] 0.21% of total Global wealth so it's
[74:14] tiny it's
[74:16] 0.21% uh and I mean that could easily go
[74:18] up to 5% 10% and Beyond but let's be
[74:22] conservative so if over the last 10
[74:24] years Bitcoin has grown at a rate of you
[74:26] say 84% so we could be conserv
[74:30] conservative and say over the next 10
[74:31] years Bitcoin could grow at a rate of
[74:33] 30% so if that was the
[74:38] case if we look at the global Capital
[74:42] would increase as well so we'd go from
[74:44] 992 trillion to 77 trillion so
[74:47] approaching that two quadrillion that
[74:50] would be an increase of like
[74:52] 6% per year over the next um 10 years
[74:56] that Bitcoin going from 0. 21% to 3% of
[75:00] global Capital would mean that Bitcoin
[75:01] would have a a market cap of $53
[75:04] trillion and that would be $2.5 million
[75:07] per Bitcoin and that's only a 25x from
[75:09] here and of course over the previous
[75:13] yeah soorry I just wanted and it's still
[75:15] just
[75:17] 3% it's like that's still like massive
[75:19] wealth everywhere else like uh it's it's
[75:22] it's still a at that point still in the
[75:25] beginning yeah I mean honestly I I think
[75:27] this is got to be
[75:29] conservative really
[75:32] but yeah that's it it's still only would
[75:35] only be 3% of global Capital based on
[75:37] that prediction but who
[75:41] knows that's a prediction
[75:43] anyway absolutely and it's it's it it's
[75:47] super interesting to look at those uh
[75:50] Baseline assumptions of those like
[75:52] baselines where we could go uh and then
[75:56] you quickly come to the conclusion even
[75:58] if you're very conservative even if
[76:00] you're uh going on a very very uh almost
[76:05] bearish kind of a baseline assumption
[76:09] you're very bullish it's like like it's
[76:12] it's it's it's hard to be uh not excited
[76:15] about the future uh when you're Bitcoin
[76:18] So yeah thank you so much for for that
[76:20] that that was a a really great um
[76:22] presentation of like all the things that
[76:25] uh that that you laid out like that that
[76:27] was that was really cool I hope people
[76:29] enjoy and appreciate that a lot yeah
[76:32] yeah thanks Robin really cool um we have
[76:37] uh one question to ask each and every
[76:38] one of my guests and the question is
[76:40] what do we can learn from you besides
[76:42] Bitcoin what can learn from me besides
[76:45] Bitcoin
[76:47] um yeah that's a good question I think
[76:51] um yeah probably something that I try to
[76:56] do in my life every day is is is
[76:59] maintaining presence particularly with
[77:02] my family um and also with all the noise
[77:05] that's going on in the world so every
[77:07] chance I get I try to keep myself in the
[77:10] present um and uh yeah I guess that
[77:14] mostly that's about really spending time
[77:17] with my kids I guess and um being
[77:19] present for them
[77:21] so that's how I do that try to do medit
[77:25] things like that but almost don't get
[77:27] time for that these days but um yeah
[77:30] that's probably my most important focus
[77:33] and it's that that is the most important
[77:35] Focus so really really cool that that
[77:37] you're doing doing that um we have endro
[77:39] in the podcast um but maybe before we
[77:41] start into that is there anything you
[77:43] want to add to the presentation anything
[77:46] that that maybe you want to add before
[77:49] we come to the end routine yeah I guess
[77:51] maybe just uh mention a little bit about
[77:53] what I'm doing with edge2 so
[77:56] um age 21 was something I've started
[77:59] over the past year so I've gone
[78:01] full-time uh into the bigcoin space
[78:03] because you know as we've discussed
[78:05] earlier like once you go down the
[78:07] Bitcoin Rabbit Hole you realize it's the
[78:08] most important thing for us moving
[78:10] forward and so h21 is basically Bitcoin
[78:13] intelligence for Bitcoin Maxis and um
[78:18] I'm sure you might agree but sometimes
[78:20] this world can be drowning in in noise
[78:22] and so AG 21 can be like your guide down
[78:25] the Bitcoin rabbit hole which gives you
[78:27] the edge that you need and there's
[78:29] endless content out there and my God you
[78:31] know Robin you create a load of content
[78:34] and and and great content which is why
[78:36] we love to summarize it um but you know
[78:38] your time you know that's scarce and so
[78:40] what we're trying to do with age of 21
[78:42] is curate the best between articles
[78:44] tweets uh nosta notes videos podcast
[78:48] charts allinone personalized feed so
[78:50] that uh there's less distractions and
[78:54] more pure Bitcoin signal and uh as I
[78:57] mentioned we we summarize you know the
[78:59] best podcasts such as yours and and
[79:01] videos so that people can if they don't
[79:04] have the time they can get the key
[79:05] insights that they need um and another
[79:08] cool feature I want to mention as well
[79:09] is we we're doing these price alerts
[79:12] that not only show the percentage
[79:13] changes in Bitcoin but also explain why
[79:16] Bitcoin moved and actually we're using
[79:18] AI for a lot of that too and we're
[79:20] updating that in real time and you know
[79:22] a lot of work has gone into getting that
[79:24] right and we're continuing to improve on
[79:26] that um because I guess understanding
[79:29] you know the why can help you make
[79:31] better
[79:32] decisions and uh yeah we just get look
[79:34] we're just getting started so we're also
[79:37] adding um important charts and and data
[79:40] that that really matters in Bitcoin such
[79:43] as onchain data technical analysis uh
[79:46] network activity macr Trends and more so
[79:49] yeah if you want pure Bitcoin signal not
[79:52] noise that's what H 21's for and it's
[79:55] Bitcoin only no crypto no
[79:57] shitcoins uh no noise yeah really cool I
[80:01] I love that and and we we do need that
[80:03] in in in this in this scene uh really
[80:06] cool um we have end routin in the
[80:07] podcast where the previous guest is
[80:09] asking a question for the next guest
[80:11] without knowing who the next guest
[80:12] actually is and this one is an
[80:13] interesting one um if you could sit down
[80:16] with Satoshi what would you ask him
[80:20] probably gosh that's such a good
[80:23] question um I'd love to know
[80:25] what made makes him tick you know what
[80:30] like what was it about his life that
[80:35] made him you know come up with this idea
[80:38] for Bitcoin you know what what was it
[80:41] that brought this idea together
[80:45] um and you know where did it come from
[80:48] basically so be really trying to
[80:51] understand um how it all came together
[80:54] that's super I I also I I really want to
[80:58] know from him if he anticipated
[81:02] everything like if if I could sit down
[81:04] with him like right now like did he did
[81:08] he see that or did he just like oh let
[81:11] let's develop something cool that that
[81:13] might might take off in the future and
[81:15] let's see where it goes or did he
[81:18] actually anticipated that Bitcoin is
[81:20] going to towards because there are many
[81:23] Stepping Stones where Bitcoin could have
[81:25] actually failed along the way we're now
[81:28] beyond that point uh but uh we were not
[81:31] beyond the point in 2010 or 12 or 13 it
[81:36] would be one like I have so many
[81:38] questions to bitcoiners so I I would
[81:40] have a lot of questions to
[81:42] Satoshi that would be one hack of a
[81:44] podcast yeah I know and that's right and
[81:47] whether he would you know expect these
[81:49] different layers to bitcoin as well and
[81:53] um I mean it seems as though how finny
[81:55] kind of predicted that would be the case
[81:58] uh I mean God he he predicted it would
[82:00] be a you know trillion dollar asset you
[82:04] know very very quickly um which is
[82:06] incredible his
[82:08] foresight um but
