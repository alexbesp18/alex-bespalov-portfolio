--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] is a solution even though they only make
[00:02] say a few hundred a month at best if we
[00:05] could just teach about saving 5% in
[00:07] Bitcoin and the magic and the power of
[00:09] that over a longer period of time we
[00:11] believe that's that extremely powerful
[00:13] they have cell phones they're on Tik Tok
[00:15] they're on Facebook let's introduce them
[00:17] to Noster and that's why we really dumb
[00:19] it down to like just teaching basic
[00:21] savings as this is a new savings
[00:24] technology and if you want to learn more
[00:26] then we'll we'll pull back the curtain
[00:27] more but we don't just want to jam it
[00:29] all up in your face we want you to ask
[00:30] how is this possible and we could just
[00:32] show you exactly what we're doing so I
[00:34] think that's probably the biggest thing
[00:36] when you think about philanthropy this
[00:38] maybe people wondering how you're able
[00:40] to do it we end up plugging in these old
[00:41] miners at a children's home in the
[00:43] jungle 5 hours away from any major city
[00:46] uh on this unused solar and really send
[00:49] the signal that there's a hill tribe in
[00:51] the distant mountains you know off grid
[00:53] 5 hours away in the jungle connected to
[00:55] the Bitcoin Network that was the cool
[00:57] thing to us you know like the crypto
[00:58] Bros want a Lamborghini we just want to
[01:00] educate more people about
[01:02] [Music]
[01:06] Bitcoin you in Thailand educating people
[01:09] on bitcoin as As I understood it right
[01:11] yes we're in changai Thailand and uh we
[01:14] have the Bitcoin Learning Center it's
[01:16] been about two years
[01:17] now what is the Bitcoin Learning Center
[01:20] side on I think on Twitter side so uh
[01:23] it's education center that we help uh
[01:26] local native Thai people learn about the
[01:28] basics of Finance and and what is money
[01:31] and what is bitcoin and we also have a
[01:34] introduction to bitcoin for foreigners
[01:36] in English and then we have an advanced
[01:39] Bitcoin meet uh Meetup which is for
[01:42] people that are already in Bitcoin
[01:45] understand Bitcoin and uh those three
[01:47] main classes or meetups we have have
[01:50] turned into like events because it's
[01:53] quite uh quite large so like for example
[01:56] we'll have an advanced bitco Meetup and
[01:59] we have to set rate the differences of
[02:00] them um because the advanced guys don't
[02:04] want to go to what is bitcoin again and
[02:08] uh and so they they've reached like 50
[02:10] people each time we have an event so a
[02:13] Meetup so they're now events um for
[02:16] example this weekend we have 50 people
[02:20] coming that are Thai native Thai
[02:22] speaking to um uh an advanced one to
[02:25] talk about community building and then
[02:27] the following day we have about 40
[02:29] people uh Bitcoin curious to learn about
[02:33] Bitcoin there's a real challenge
[02:35] actually with because I know that new
[02:38] people actually listen sometimes to the
[02:40] podcast and I get the DMs like oh like
[02:42] you sometimes I get too into the Bitcoin
[02:45] and and it it would be better to cover
[02:47] the basics of Bitcoin again on the
[02:49] podcast um uh but if you only cover the
[02:52] basis of like oh what is bitcoin why do
[02:53] we need it it gets boring for people
[02:56] because most people listening to this
[02:58] actually have a good understanding of
[02:59] Bitcoin so if you always talk about why
[03:02] Bitcoin and and what is
[03:04] bitcoin it it bows most of the people
[03:07] and it especially BS me at some point
[03:09] also uh and this makes bad content but I
[03:12] think it's uh it's an interesting
[03:13] balance to find of like H how you can
[03:16] have uh beginner content of like what is
[03:19] bitcoin why is Bitcoin the like the a
[03:21] economics the the sound principles
[03:24] underneath it but then also go deeper on
[03:26] on more topics for for the uh Advanced
[03:29] crowd
[03:30] you know we find like sometimes a lot of
[03:33] the people that make it too advanced or
[03:36] a big event where we bring everyone
[03:38] together they feel they aren't they have
[03:41] their own idea of what Advanced is and
[03:43] so they thought they weren't ready for
[03:45] that so we're having we all have a tough
[03:47] time with the terminology because like
[03:49] oh you should definitely be at the more
[03:51] experienced Bitcoin Meetup um because
[03:54] you know you've been in Bitcoin for a
[03:55] year or two and they think it might be
[03:56] more like you know Bitcoin mining or
[03:59] like the depths node running or like
[04:00] something silly so we just try to make
[04:02] it like hey everything's easy and calm
[04:04] and cool because we want as many people
[04:06] to feel as comfortable as possible so
[04:08] it's not like oh you don't it's your
[04:10] first time you know you can't come to
[04:12] the it's not like that at all it's just
[04:14] you know this might be a little more um
[04:17] Advanced and then this might be a little
[04:19] more introductory so we we we try to
[04:22] break it down and offer each month we
[04:24] we'll try to have this the same uh
[04:27] schedule so we'll have one like that
[04:29] that week that's also um for beginners
[04:32] and also for people that are
[04:35] experienced yeah I'm thinking even about
[04:38] developing um a like a seven segment
[04:42] course of around Bitcoin on my podcast
[04:45] uh and just like giving it to like okay
[04:48] you want to start on my podcast like if
[04:50] you don't know about Bitcoin that's the
[04:52] seven uh episodes you can watch and then
[04:55] after that you you can go to whatever
[04:57] episode you you would like and and pick
[04:58] from like now almost 500 different
[05:01] people you you can tune
[05:03] in yeah it's cool like we we've been
[05:07] doing this for about uh two years now uh
[05:09] just under two years and it's grown
[05:12] quite rapidly just like our last uh
[05:15] event when uh was a 100 100 people and
[05:19] there these are 100 bitcoiners so we're
[05:21] really when we announced it we announced
[05:23] it on all the social channels you know
[05:25] and we're really clear about you know
[05:27] attention bitcoiners we've got you know
[05:29] free food for bitcoiners and we keep we
[05:31] Hammer that down because we really want
[05:33] to keep it uh focused you know uh we
[05:36] understand that people are interested in
[05:37] other things and we also understand that
[05:40] people come from you know the sh the
[05:42] shitcoin casino also so we don't want to
[05:45] just like have you know a hard stop at
[05:48] the door like no you're not welcome
[05:50] because we know people come from there
[05:51] and that's a lot how most people are
[05:53] finally arrive at Bitcoin so we welcome
[05:56] everyone you know um and it's never been
[05:58] like people ask us often you know is it
[06:01] do you have problems with that it's not
[06:02] like people are coming in trying to like
[06:05] you know be disruptive about about their
[06:07] coin or something or trying to sell it
[06:08] because we're pretty when you walk in
[06:10] there it's pretty orange and it's pretty
[06:12] you know it's big Bitcoin and we'll have
[06:15] like larger events and someone will say
[06:17] like hey is this you know they'll even
[06:19] come to me they don't know that you know
[06:20] I work there and they'll say you know do
[06:22] people talk about other things and I'm
[06:24] like sh you don't want to mention that
[06:26] around here you don't want to mention
[06:28] the wrong person cuz they'll give you a
[06:30] hard time you know so but being in this
[06:32] position we really want to celebrate
[06:34] every bitcoiner that comes through the
[06:36] building we want to empower them and
[06:38] encourage them so it's important that
[06:40] we're respectful and understanding and
[06:42] really want to take that opportunity if
[06:44] they're they haven't if they haven't
[06:46] found Bitcoin yet we know they will
[06:48] eventually so we want to make sure
[06:51] we handle them with care and show them
[06:55] you know the right guys or women in the
[06:57] room that could help carry them on you
[07:00] know super interesting um so you do it
[07:03] all physically and there are like event
[07:06] centers and and is there even like um
[07:09] like a center where people come in is
[07:11] just a Learning Center yes so it's
[07:13] awesome so uh we to we reconstructed a
[07:16] 40-year-old building that my partner F's
[07:19] father had and uh it's three stories so
[07:22] we gutted the whole thing and we
[07:24] completely renovated it to be the
[07:26] Bitcoin building so we have uh we're
[07:28] working on the third floor now so when
[07:30] people come in there's this big huge uh
[07:33] whiteboard etched in in wood on the wall
[07:36] big orange leather couch and then a huge
[07:39] um Teakwood table kitchen it's really
[07:42] it's really modern for for in Thailand
[07:44] and then as you go up the second floor
[07:46] you can just see it's a huge big open
[07:48] space where we have uh big tables for
[07:51] learning a a conference room a boardroom
[07:54] uh then we and we have a special we call
[07:56] Bob's Corner our partner in Bangkok
[07:58] build on bitcoin uh we have like their
[08:00] big banner over there and we got a
[08:03] pretty cool like leather orange couch
[08:05] that reclines over there so we've got
[08:06] all this like open space for
[08:08] collaboration and working and really for
[08:11] events because our meetups are now
[08:12] events because they've gotten so large
[08:15] like we really don't have an event
[08:16] that's less than 50 people now 50
[08:18] bitcoiners 50 bitcoiners you know so
[08:21] that and and so being in changai
[08:23] Thailand there's a lot of expats there
[08:26] like so one of the reasons that I moved
[08:27] here a little over three about three and
[08:30] a half years ago was because there was a
[08:31] Bitcoin community and there it's one of
[08:34] the longest running Bitcoin communities
[08:36] in Southeast Asia so since 2016 there's
[08:39] been a Bitcoin Meetup and it's been
[08:40] relatively small but it's more of a
[08:43] social Meetup it's not really structured
[08:46] people come people
[08:48] go it's less than 50% Bitcoin only so we
[08:52] recognize like that's cool but we needed
[08:54] a Bitcoin focused building for education
[08:57] and and to really uh be focused on
[09:00] bitcoin only so and that was really
[09:03] great so uh now he's able to send some
[09:05] people our way instead of it just being
[09:08] like you know smokes and jokes and
[09:10] drinking they could come over and and
[09:11] have like structured stuff so we'll have
[09:13] classes on self- custody uh we'll have
[09:16] classes on
[09:18] inheritance um we'll have basic classes
[09:21] on uh on events and activities like we
[09:24] work in the hill tribes um which we
[09:27] could get into which is an incredible
[09:28] story
[09:30] uh how we introduce Bitcoin to the hill
[09:31] tribes and so a lot of people want to
[09:34] know what we're working on like one of
[09:35] the reasons we have this microphone is
[09:38] because well we didn't want to get into
[09:39] podcast it's just not our it's not our
[09:42] like Vibe it's not for us or it wasn't
[09:44] for me specifically I just I wanted to
[09:47] focus on community building and
[09:49] education but many people were very
[09:51] curious about what we do up in the
[09:53] mountains with Bitcoin and these Hill
[09:55] tribes so we had gotten professional
[09:58] recording equipment because we're always
[10:00] answering with just the the earphones
[10:03] and or the wire so it's developed quite
[10:06] rapidly to people want to actually hear
[10:08] and see what we're what we're doing in
[10:10] Northern Thailand because it's really
[10:11] fascinating to come see it's one thing
[10:13] to hear about it but like if you come to
[10:15] one of our events it's pretty intense we
[10:17] just had someone last week or two weeks
[10:19] ago that's never seen bitcoiners in
[10:21] person and he's like this is insane it's
[10:23] like a small little conference because
[10:25] there's 30 people on the downstairs 30
[10:27] people on the second floor 30 30 people
[10:29] on the third floor and it's just super
[10:31] awesome energy so I mean you really have
[10:33] to come and see it you know anytime that
[10:35] you're if you're ever in Northern
[10:36] Thailand in Thailand you definitely have
[10:38] to come see the Bitcoin Learning Center
[10:40] I I never was there but I will
[10:42] definitely if I when I will come there
[10:44] will I will get there um I want to get
[10:46] into Hill traps but maybe first um uh
[10:50] why did you move in the first place to
[10:52] Thailand so I moved in Thailand in well
[10:55] I left America in 2018 to travel and
[10:59] after traveling for warm weather uh I
[11:01] have a organization in the states that I
[11:04] is ran by very uh a super smart woman in
[11:08] Miami or uh north south Florida uh so
[11:12] she still runs the organization there we
[11:14] we deliver prepared food but I stepped
[11:16] aside and let her run the organization
[11:18] and I left in
[11:19] 2018 uh how I eventually arrived in
[11:21] Thailand was I was looking for the very
[11:23] best place I went I went the whole route
[11:25] that like the the digital people go you
[11:28] know whether it's in columia or down to
[11:31] a player to Karm Mexico or out into
[11:34] Spain in Portugal and so I try to like
[11:37] search for all the best places to go
[11:39] eventually I made to Southeast Asia and
[11:42] the main one of the major reasons I
[11:44] moved to Southeast Asia was because I
[11:46] could buy more Bitcoin so I have a
[11:47] western income a strong Western income
[11:50] from the Corp from the company and then
[11:52] my cost of living is 300% less so I
[11:55] could stack 300% more so that was like a
[11:58] a huge reason and then all roads kind of
[12:01] led me to to to Chang maai Thailand
[12:04] because the mountain Vibe it's laidback
[12:07] the people are kind it's extremely safe
[12:10] you know as a bitcoiner that's something
[12:11] that you really have to be thoughtful
[12:13] about is the Safety and Security of
[12:15] where you live uh that Comfort alone is
[12:18] is a big reason that I moved there and
[12:19] it's super affordable so uh and
[12:22] especially if you know if you are able
[12:25] to make an Western income and live in
[12:26] the East there's that Arbitrage there
[12:29] it's really compounding if you're
[12:30] stacking a Bitcoin for many years
[12:31] interesting I like that it's also like
[12:35] once you um unplug yourself from a
[12:37] specific location which are basically
[12:39] done last year you get to think about
[12:42] okay where do I actually want to live
[12:44] and tiand is something that came up a
[12:46] lot because I'm I'm searching basically
[12:49] every other month of like okay if I want
[12:51] to move out of Austria uh if I want to
[12:54] take that step where do we want want to
[12:56] go uh and Thailand always comes up in a
[12:58] re such and I think it's it's a
[13:00] fascinating place I already um
[13:02] interviewed some some bitcoiners there
[13:04] uh it's it's a really really cool place
[13:06] uh but now do the do the hill tribes
[13:09] what what is a hill tribe that's a great
[13:12] question what is the hill tribe so it's
[13:13] the people that live um on the outside
[13:17] of of so on the Outer Outer sides of
[13:20] society in these small villages um that
[13:22] are literally in the Hills um typically
[13:25] On the Border you know uh this could be
[13:27] quite a wide border it could be 50 miles
[13:30] or 100 kilometers but from the border of
[13:33] Burma or China and these the hill tribes
[13:36] people up there there's several
[13:37] different types of them we work with the
[13:39] the Karin Hill tribe that are Christian
[13:41] Hill
[13:43] tribe and we we would go up there
[13:45] because they uh we started the
[13:47] foundation as An Education Foundation by
[13:50] providing English teachers to different
[13:52] orphanages uh in the city and then we we
[13:55] ended up realizing the biggest need was
[13:58] these most dis connected uh marginalized
[14:01] communities in the hill tribes so
[14:02] there's 100 children at this children's
[14:04] home we went up there and we spent some
[14:07] time up there we recognized hey these
[14:10] guys really need power they're close
[14:12] enough to a school they don't have power
[14:15] why don't we build them in you know a
[14:16] solar system and uh so we decided to
[14:20] build a small five kilowatt solar system
[14:22] for them they ended up not using it that
[14:25] much and then so we had unused power and
[14:28] then we're talked for friends in Bangkok
[14:30] the piccolo down there buil on bitcoin
[14:32] Bok said listen man I don't know if this
[14:34] is possible like I'm not really into
[14:36] mining much at the time and I said he's
[14:40] like well why don't we come up there and
[14:41] check out what you're talking about so a
[14:44] bunch of guys came up a guy next to not
[14:47] far from you from Switzerland from Burn
[14:50] uh he he's part of the Bob space cohort
[14:53] came a few guys came up one guy from
[14:55] Italy a guy from Spain and they checked
[14:58] it out and they're like yeah dude we
[14:59] could definitely plug in some old miners
[15:01] so we end up plugging in these old
[15:02] miners at a children's home in the
[15:04] jungle five hours away from any major
[15:07] city uh on this unused solar and as soon
[15:11] as we mentioned it on Twitter at the
[15:14] time we had more donations that the that
[15:18] the that the miners would earn in one
[15:20] year we had more donations in one day
[15:23] sent to the Bitcoin address of the minor
[15:26] that it would generate even it powering
[15:28] for full year so that was super
[15:30] inspiring owering and but just let me
[15:33] explain this was maybe like $10 a month
[15:38] or $12 a month or 40,000 SATs or
[15:40] something at the time so it wasn't much
[15:42] and this is preh having and then you'd
[15:45] have to think about it running on full
[15:46] batteries 24 hours a day and it also
[15:49] rains so and it's not really practical
[15:52] it was just hey how could we plug them
[15:53] into the Bitcoin Network and really send
[15:55] the signal that there's a hill tribe in
[15:58] the distant Mountain
[15:59] you know off grid five hours away in the
[16:01] jungle connected to the Bitcoin Network
[16:03] like that was the cool thing to us you
[16:05] know so then um after after testing that
[16:09] and that's really difficult there's so
[16:11] many complexities when it's just smaller
[16:14] than than hobby mining uh we and we F we
[16:18] work with another another Community
[16:21] under the same Hill tribe umbrella that
[16:24] has like 10 times the amount of solar
[16:26] it's a solar Village well it's it's
[16:29] powered entirely by solar because the
[16:31] government displaced this community
[16:34] called do toau uh by building a dam many
[16:38] years ago and in return of flooding
[16:41] their land and their animals and their
[16:43] houses they decided sometime over the
[16:46] last 10 years or seven years that they
[16:49] would give them a huge huge solar setup
[16:53] so just recently again this next year so
[16:56] this is like the following year we went
[17:00] up with another group uh of of miners
[17:03] specifically miners that come from the
[17:06] Bob space guy uh the Bitcoin build on
[17:08] bitcoin group they came on and checked
[17:10] it out because this is way over my
[17:11] league now I don't want to burn anything
[17:13] down you know this is what you know it's
[17:15] really we got to really think up the
[17:17] whole process there's a language
[17:19] difference there's they're not technical
[17:22] you know so we're we're right now
[17:24] working through that um and we're going
[17:26] to talk more about it uh this upcoming
[17:28] weekend on next steps so because we
[17:30] already have three miners up there we
[17:32] have two s19 J Pros sitting that we've
[17:36] already tested there and then an M20 I
[17:38] think it is um that's sitting up there
[17:41] that we brought so we went there on two
[17:42] occasions we tested some things out and
[17:45] and so yeah hopefully we could uh help
[17:47] them uh monetize some of the extra
[17:49] energy that they have there it's such a
[17:51] big power off of Bitcoin just being able
[17:55] to monetize that you can just plug in a
[17:58] minor and it's people sometimes bring up
[18:02] all you could also do this with AI or
[18:04] with any other data sentence it's
[18:06] actually not like that Bitcoin is is so
[18:09] unique because you can turn it on and
[18:11] off again you don't need the the base
[18:13] load like you you have no problem
[18:16] whatsoever with like latency or anything
[18:19] like that uh and there are expert that
[18:21] can explain that way better why it is
[18:23] like that I'm I'm not the mining expert
[18:27] but it's it's pretty unique of of having
[18:29] Bitcoin miners in extremely weird
[18:34] locations where you wouldn't even
[18:36] anticipate it uh and you just need to I
[18:38] don't know like a a starlink and some
[18:40] solar roofs or like whatever you need or
[18:43] however you connect it um and you're
[18:45] good to go and you can monetize that and
[18:47] you don't you don't waste that energy
[18:50] and I think it's such a unique power of
[18:52] of Bitcoin that is overlooked by non-
[18:54] bitcoiners it's crazy like if you think
[18:56] of when people say oh I want to donate
[18:59] to a children's home or this don't
[19:01] donate clothes don't donate food donate
[19:04] solar panels batteries inverters and old
[19:08] miners you know like that's what you
[19:11] need to donate and and and and and and
[19:13] if as long as you have a bitcoiner
[19:15] Within Reach like a few hours that's
[19:17] really passionate about it because it's
[19:20] more got to be a passion project you
[19:21] know that you really want to see them
[19:23] plugged into the Bitcoin Network and see
[19:25] them learning about it um and and then
[19:28] yeah maybe that'll catch on and maybe
[19:29] we'll get donations maybe it won't but
[19:31] donate like the things that donate these
[19:34] things you know just donate the solar
[19:35] panels and donate the inverters donate
[19:37] the batteries and do and donate the old
[19:39] miners this makes just too much sense to
[19:42] me so it's a unique thing that we do uh
[19:45] up here in Northern Thailand but we also
[19:47] do formal formal Bitcoin research so um
[19:52] our our director of the foundation fi uh
[19:55] she's got her master's degree from from
[19:57] Texas A&M in America uh she is the the
[20:02] director of the costro foundation does
[20:04] everything with the hill tribes with us
[20:06] all the disadvantage communities she's
[20:08] pursuing uh a formal Bitcoin education
[20:12] on on their access five different Hill
[20:16] tribes access to uh credit their dig
[20:20] digital literacy their financial
[20:22] literacy so right now um the team we
[20:26] have go out there they do a survey they
[20:28] come back we put it in the system and
[20:31] we're at the analysis process where
[20:33] she's uh she's done 100 no I'm sorry
[20:37] 1,000 surveys 200 uh people in five
[20:41] different Hill tribe communities in nor
[20:43] in Northern Thailand uh so that's super
[20:46] um super empowering to to watch that
[20:48] unfold there's a lot of people
[20:50] interested in that obviously it's all
[20:52] going to be open source for any
[20:54] organization or any government to just
[20:55] look at our data and say hey this is
[20:58] this status on these people and we
[21:01] believe that because they're on these
[21:04] marginalized communities on the very
[21:05] fringes of society out there inflation
[21:08] really affects them the most they can't
[21:10] get a second job like they can't just
[21:13] increase the price of their Tomatoes or
[21:17] or whatever product that they're selling
[21:19] it's not it's not as easy as if you're
[21:21] live in the city so we see that you know
[21:25] each year it's getting harder and harder
[21:26] for the for the people affected the most
[21:29] and we want to do this research so that
[21:33] it could shine a light on on the subject
[21:36] and eventually arrive at how saving in
[21:38] Bitcoin is a solution even though they
[21:41] only make say a few hundred dollars a
[21:43] month at at best if we could just teach
[21:46] about saving 5% in Bitcoin and the magic
[21:49] and the power of that over a longer
[21:50] period of time we believe that's that
[21:53] extremely
[21:55] powerful and and you you hear that a lot
[21:58] actually
[21:59] not a lot but I hear that sometimes
[22:00] where people say like oh like how does
[22:02] Bitcoin help uh underprivileged
[22:04] communities that don't even have money
[22:05] to save and I think always the the the
[22:09] hope of being able to even save a few
[22:14] sets every month even though if it's not
[22:16] a lot uh as a oneoff thing it
[22:20] accumulates and it's the power and it's
[22:22] that small thing that's like oh like
[22:24] there's some small thing that is
[22:26] actually growing there's a small peaking
[22:28] of of Hope for me and I think that's
[22:30] that's so that's so empowering I I like
[22:33] that a lot uh and how how do you see
[22:36] that uh the role of Bitcoin in in like
[22:38] those underprivileged communities so it
[22:40] is empowering and we can teach them
[22:43] about saving and we can show them in a
[22:45] variety of different ways so in December
[22:48] we had I had sent out a message a Noster
[22:51] I don't I don't speak Tha I could just
[22:53] say get around a little bit um I don't
[22:56] write In tha and I can't read in Thai
[22:57] but I wrote a message and Thai had it
[23:00] had it edited for me and it was sent to
[23:02] Noster to a big Community we have in
[23:05] Thailand uh called seamster that's their
[23:08] hashtag um and I could talk about all
[23:10] that that that community in a moment and
[23:12] I said I'm looking for the top four
[23:14] power
[23:15] users of Noster in Thailand that we will
[23:19] fly up from Bangkok to changai which is
[23:21] an hour flight and flying here is like
[23:23] $50 us it's not that bad it's not
[23:25] terrible we'll pay for your flights
[23:27] roundt trip you'll come to the hill
[23:29] tribes with us we've got an event of 500
[23:31] people 200 kids we want you to show them
[23:35] how to use Bitcoin lightning using
[23:37] Noster because they have social media
[23:40] they have cell phones they have a living
[23:42] aunt or uncle that helped them have have
[23:45] their their cell phone usage they're on
[23:48] Tik Tok they're on Facebook let's
[23:50] introduce them to Noster so we came this
[23:53] is maybe December 14th just a few months
[23:55] ago four of them came up it was it was
[23:59] wild we've rented a van there was 12 of
[24:01] us we went up there and we had we had
[24:05] was during their Christmas event so we
[24:06] were part of their Christmas event
[24:08] finally got over a hundred kids inside
[24:11] of the church because the weather is
[24:12] pretty uh pretty challenging at the time
[24:15] broke them into groups of 20 people had
[24:18] five instructors that are super power
[24:20] users that love Noster that that love
[24:22] using the system and as as much as we
[24:26] were hopeful that everyone would figure
[24:27] it out maybe that maybe most of them did
[24:30] not but they quickly learned about
[24:33] getting these points and we and we were
[24:34] just we would we would give them like I
[24:37] don't know like three a dollar or two
[24:39] dollars each no$ three dollar each uh
[24:43] just just to to test and they started
[24:45] sending lightning and each group was
[24:46] doing it their own way getting them on
[24:48] whether that's using a metheus or they
[24:50] broke them into I think an iOS group and
[24:53] and into an Android group because of the
[24:56] different apps so um maybe Primal is not
[24:59] the best use and at a time we were using
[25:01] Yaki hon because the the onboarding when
[25:04] you go in the setup of your app you
[25:06] don't have to read English you could
[25:07] actually read it in Thai so anyway the
[25:11] kids first their their first very first
[25:13] uh interaction with money wasn't the
[25:16] tibot wasn't the Euro wasn't the dollar
[25:20] it was
[25:21] Bitcoin and even though they're not so
[25:24] sure what this is or why this team's so
[25:27] excited about it you know we've helped
[25:29] them build these ma these huge kitchens
[25:31] for a 100 children uh water wells and
[25:35] bathrooms and dormitories and we never
[25:38] just say Bitcoin you have to learn it's
[25:40] just like why do we always see this
[25:43] Bitcoin thing why do they keep why are
[25:45] they teaching us about this so how it
[25:47] could affect these marginalized
[25:48] communities and Hill tribes is like
[25:50] bring your passion and and just start
[25:52] showing these tools and I think that was
[25:55] like a real a moment where maybe a few
[25:58] of them we our idea was that they use a
[26:01] hashtag of their Village name and then
[26:04] hashtag Hill tribe so I guess you could
[26:06] go on nozer right now and hashtag
[26:08] hilltribe and see if anyone's using it
[26:10] and then if some if it catches on then
[26:13] the kids could see they can monetize
[26:15] into it here in Thailand we could we
[26:18] don't have a problem transferring money
[26:20] because we have all those QR payment all
[26:22] the banks are linked which is pretty
[26:25] frightening kind of so we could easily
[26:28] just send them uh a th000 bot or $30 for
[26:33] their $30 in sets you know so that
[26:37] there's it was just a really cool moment
[26:40] to to to just share about how I think
[26:42] that you could Implement Noster in the
[26:44] hill tribes and and just see if it takes
[26:48] take hold you know and show them like
[26:50] you got to spend a little more time with
[26:51] them and go over it a little bit um but
[26:54] once they get it and they know that they
[26:55] could just transfer that out into into
[26:57] bot then the magic just starts Happening
[26:59] by
[27:01] itself are you doing a lot of those
[27:04] philanthropic uh projects uh down there
[27:08] so I think that's how we started off um
[27:11] we we just started off doing
[27:12] philanthropic projects that were not
[27:15] related to bitcoin and it's only reason
[27:16] we're able to do it is because of
[27:19] Bitcoin like if I if we had to worry
[27:21] about like our
[27:23] future before Bitcoin we'd be like you
[27:27] know doing everything we can to prepare
[27:30] for when we retire and when we're older
[27:33] but because Bitcoin is so powerful and
[27:36] it's given so much hope and we have so
[27:38] much belief in it we're able to do these
[27:40] things and help build their churches and
[27:43] help build different elements of the
[27:46] school or the bathrooms or or lighting
[27:49] or solar systems or fly people up to
[27:52] introduce them to new technology and now
[27:55] we're starting basic uh Financial
[27:57] education out there too so uh so yeah I
[28:00] I get that's how it started I guess the
[28:02] whole the whole thing is philanthropic I
[28:04] mean uh the whole the whole operation we
[28:06] have five staff and you know we we spend
[28:09] seven days a week on bitcoin up here uh
[28:12] we have a lot of a lot of moving Parts
[28:15] up here and so um I think the whole
[28:17] thing is that you know many people you
[28:21] know that there's that there's that like
[28:23] what do they call it like you know like
[28:24] the crypto Bros want a Lamborghini like
[28:27] we just want to educate more people
[28:29] about Bitcoin like that's what we want
[28:31] to do when number goes up like we want
[28:33] to help more people and and so like on
[28:36] Saturday even though it's an only tii
[28:39] class I'll have a translator many of
[28:42] them are Engineers that understand
[28:43] English but I'll be talking about how we
[28:45] could reach a million Thai people and
[28:47] there's 72 72 or 73 million people just
[28:51] expose them just make be be that touch
[28:54] point the awareness of Bitcoin you know
[28:58] because you know you you know Robin like
[29:00] it takes time it took me quite a bit of
[29:03] time to figure it all out and so I know
[29:07] I know we need these touch points it's
[29:09] not just like a it's not something that
[29:10] you could just you know put right in
[29:12] someone's head so that's that's why
[29:14] we're doing so much work and that's why
[29:16] we're working on such big projects and
[29:18] and later this year we have even bigger
[29:20] projects so it's it's uh it's a big team
[29:22] effort up here let's take a break for a
[29:25] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[29:28] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[29:30] watches those watches are the most
[29:33] amazing the most elegent way of showing
[29:36] that you are a true bitcoiner and coin
[29:39] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[29:42] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:45] watch collections you have the date of
[29:48] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[29:51] there and of course also the block
[29:53] height and which EPO we are currently in
[29:57] I love the level of detail they put in
[29:59] in this masterpiece make sure to check
[30:02] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[30:05] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[30:07] those watches so so much and now if you
[30:11] have Bitcoin I really do hope that you
[30:13] don't have it on Exchange but if you do
[30:15] have it on Exchange I have two ways for
[30:17] you to deal with that the first way is
[30:20] you put it on a hardware wallet that's
[30:22] the entry for you to get into the self
[30:25] custody game I recommend bit box Bitcoin
[30:28] only Edition for that it's a super
[30:31] simple and secure way and if you check
[30:34] out the link in the description you even
[30:36] get 5% off if you use the code Robin and
[30:39] the second way is the Bitcoin way the
[30:42] Bitcoin way is your Allin partner in
[30:45] terms of how to get the most out of your
[30:49] sovereignty they will personalize for
[30:51] you a self custody setup that is perfect
[30:54] for your individual situation they will
[30:57] show show you how you can secure your
[30:59] own devices securing your Bitcoin is not
[31:02] enough you also have to keep all your
[31:04] devices secure one topic that is
[31:06] overlooked often is the inheritance plan
[31:10] what happens with your Bitcoin once you
[31:12] are no longer here do you have a plan
[31:15] for that in place already and last but
[31:17] not least if you're in jurisdictions
[31:19] where you don't feel safe it's better to
[31:22] get a plan B for all that head over to
[31:25] the Bitcoin way.com
[31:28] Robin to get a 30 minute free call and
[31:31] just a quick side note I will be for the
[31:34] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[31:36] Prague event in June it will be
[31:39] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[31:41] looking forward to seeing all of you
[31:43] there you can get your ticket in the
[31:46] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[31:48] BR and very important use code Robin to
[31:51] get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[31:54] looking forward seeing you there I do a
[31:58] it it's super funny I had yesterday
[32:00] discussion with my girlfriend even
[32:02] around the topic but I I use everything
[32:06] that I make from the podcast uh besides
[32:09] the small thing that I need to live on
[32:12] um to reinvest in how to
[32:14] make the voice of Bitcoin in the
[32:17] internet a little bit bigger so I invest
[32:20] now in in in people that make clips and
[32:22] shorts from that and and try to figure
[32:25] out okay uh should I do other formats to
[32:28] live stream what else could I do I I try
[32:32] to just I mean it's not philanthropic
[32:34] because it's my own business uh but I do
[32:38] reinvest everything in in the Bitcoin
[32:40] voice basically and that's that's uh
[32:43] where I think the real power happens but
[32:46] maybe on the philanthropic side what do
[32:48] you think does Bitcoin do do project
[32:53] like that or or in a in a broad sense
[32:55] what does Bitcoin do to philanthrophy in
[32:58] in general I think it asks people I
[33:00] think the I think the biggest thing is
[33:02] it it Sparks
[33:04] curiosity of of people watching saying
[33:07] how how are they doing that how are they
[33:11] doing it maybe why is a little easier
[33:13] because I believe people are good
[33:15] intentioned and want to help people but
[33:17] if they start asking like how could they
[33:19] afford to do that how are they doing
[33:21] this every day how are they being funded
[33:24] and so like I I I talk to the the B
[33:27] Quinns and and the younger the the newer
[33:30] ones as well about this idea of cloning
[33:34] yourself so and and it's pretty
[33:37] fascinating so I tell them instead of
[33:38] trying to get because we live in
[33:39] Southeast Asia where a good salary is
[33:42] maybe like $77,000 a year or 300,000 bot
[33:47] or $10,000 a year so they'll get to one
[33:51] Bitcoin is like it's a little it's way
[33:54] it's Out Of Reach totally it's even Out
[33:55] Of Reach maybe in the in the Western
[33:57] World now too so we say I say it like
[33:59] this just try to get to a half of year a
[34:03] h one year one half of a half of a year
[34:05] salary in Bitcoin so if you're if you're
[34:09] earning 250,000 bot per year try to get
[34:13] to 125,000 B that's your goal because
[34:16] what happens is and then I have like a
[34:18] uh for our chart this upcoming week is a
[34:22] silhouette of of a person in black and
[34:24] then a silhouette of a person in black
[34:26] and half in Orange and and so now
[34:28] there's you working and doing your job
[34:30] and now you have half of it in Orange
[34:32] and you'll see over the next year all
[34:35] the sudden that guy's already working
[34:37] for you so now you got two of you
[34:39] because of the power of Bitcoin
[34:40] compounding the way that it compounds
[34:42] 65% per year we could look at all the
[34:45] data on average right and so that so and
[34:49] we and we have the case studies so we
[34:51] have people in the office that have
[34:52] taken their entire salary in Bitcoin
[34:53] over a year which is incredible and her
[34:56] salary has been able to literally double
[34:58] and be that example it's so then you
[35:01] show them this clone and you say wow
[35:04] then the next slide I have for Saturday
[35:05] is two orange people because over two
[35:08] and a half years now you have three of
[35:09] you working you've got you the black
[35:12] silhouette and then you got your two
[35:14] bright orange Silhouettes so then now
[35:17] you're able to do these philanthropic
[35:19] things you're able to spend more time on
[35:20] things you care about spend on time on
[35:22] helping people educate people so I think
[35:25] the big thing question is like if people
[35:28] are really curious how it's like hey
[35:29] come learn and a lot of people in
[35:31] Thailand are you know is that a scam the
[35:35] news loves to report on Bitcoin mining
[35:38] people stealing energy so we want people
[35:40] to come learn from themselves and that's
[35:42] why we really dumb it down to like just
[35:44] teaching basic savings as this is a new
[35:47] savings technology and if you want to
[35:49] learn more then we'll we'll pull back
[35:52] the curtain more but we don't just want
[35:53] to jam it all up in your face we want
[35:55] you to ask how is this possible and we
[35:57] get could just show you exactly what
[35:59] we're doing so I think that's probably
[36:01] the biggest thing when you think about
[36:03] philanthropy is maybe people wondering
[36:05] how you're able to do
[36:07] it I love the the orange man thing that
[36:11] gives me the thinking because if you
[36:13] there's this very popular Topic in in in
[36:16] Bitcoin with retire on bitcoin get the
[36:18] one Bitcoin and stuff like that uh but
[36:21] it always has the bad uh connotation on
[36:24] there it it it depends on whether you're
[36:27] not retire do you want to retire in New
[36:29] York City or do you want to retire
[36:32] somewhere in Thailand up the hill you
[36:34] need different uh Stacks uh depending on
[36:38] on on where you want to retire also
[36:40] depends on like how much you have like
[36:42] how young you are like all those
[36:44] variables that go into that thing um way
[36:48] more interesting is like okay how many
[36:50] years of expenses do you have in Bitcoin
[36:53] already like you know roughly like what
[36:55] do you spend in one year and then like
[36:58] okay like what is your like do you have
[37:00] half a year of expenses in Bitcoin
[37:02] savings do you have five years in
[37:03] expenses in Bitcoin savings and then it
[37:05] makes way more sense I think that's
[37:08] that's a great way to look at it with
[37:10] with the Silhouettes and and the orange
[37:13] man and cloning yourself and and yeah
[37:15] maybe you start off and you have like
[37:17] 20% of a year saved up and yes after 10
[37:20] years you maybe have already two or
[37:22] three years saved in in in in in savings
[37:25] and this gives you a lot of power uh of
[37:28] like hey I can do what I want because if
[37:32] it doesn't work out I have five years of
[37:35] expenses here saved up in Bitcoin that
[37:37] is that's that's the real philanthropic
[37:39] project that we have to push because
[37:42] that really empowers people correct and
[37:44] it's it's like the orange man it's like
[37:46] that guy's working for you so now you
[37:48] have two two of you working and you're
[37:50] doing your job and what's and what's it
[37:52] going to be like the next year so and
[37:54] and and the forward years is now your
[37:56] two turns into four now you got a little
[37:58] you have a little team working for you
[38:00] you know and you're and and now your
[38:02] team is stronger than the uyu so I I
[38:05] just try to share it in a way that's
[38:07] like you know get to one Bitcoin is kind
[38:08] of discouraging let's just get to a half
[38:10] year salary stick with this learn about
[38:12] it keep coming here all the time as much
[38:15] as you can ask us every question like we
[38:17] just don't stop we're Relentless like
[38:18] you Robin we just don't give up you know
[38:21] educating people so uh that's just one
[38:24] of our our ways of doing in fact just
[38:25] like two weeks ago one of the largest
[38:28] banks reached out to us like what like
[38:30] I'm I never thought like our little old
[38:32] place in Northern Thailand like the one
[38:35] of the biggest banks in Thailand is
[38:36] reaching out to us to say hey how could
[38:38] they help us like it's crazy like like I
[38:41] never thought I would never that was
[38:43] years ahead for me when when they had
[38:44] reached out to us and just we had just
[38:47] spoken at the largest university in Tha
[38:49] in Northern Thailand shenma
[38:51] University fi and Stefan and myself went
[38:55] and uh they wanted to know about
[38:57] blockchain so so we we quickly dispelled
[39:00] the differences between the Bitcoin
[39:02] blockchain the one that was around by
[39:04] itself for six years and then the one
[39:06] that's trying to solve everything other
[39:07] than money so anyway we we went to the
[39:10] we we just started going to the
[39:11] universities next month because of that
[39:14] University two of the other large
[39:16] universities want us to come and we're
[39:18] and we're scheduled in in both uh in
[39:21] April to go uh talk about Bitcoin
[39:24] specifically what Bitcoin is so it's a
[39:26] really cool movement what's happening up
[39:28] here and it's really empowering to see
[39:30] so many people come together like you
[39:33] actually have to build into your day
[39:35] that someone's gonna come through the
[39:36] door you don't know who you don't know
[39:38] why but you have to be like oh nice to
[39:41] meet you so tell me about your journey
[39:44] it's like oh man like I was just working
[39:46] on something I really was wanting
[39:47] needing to work on so you have to build
[39:48] into your day or like I like to get a
[39:50] lot of things done before I get to the
[39:52] office this way that you know I'm
[39:55] flexible when someone comes through the
[39:56] door what's really crazy is um we just
[40:01] had the a big meet uh a huge Meetup when
[40:04] we were announcing the Bitcoin marathon
[40:05] and Festival which we could get into in
[40:07] a moment which is gonna which is super
[40:09] super big right now for us we we had
[40:13] during the day a a tie specific Meetup
[40:16] and and out of that they said listen you
[40:19] got all the equipment you know we should
[40:21] have a tie podcast so and and it's
[40:25] because the p the passion be there was
[40:27] someone that a creator that wants to do
[40:30] the producing part there's a host that
[40:32] loves to be doing content creation so
[40:34] they put it all together and just over
[40:37] the last four weeks like the Channel's
[40:39] you know the early days of the channel
[40:40] are so exciting right you see the
[40:42] numbers really climbing and and your
[40:44] engagement is huge and so this is like
[40:46] this was our zero to one moment even
[40:48] though we've been doing this for two
[40:49] years uh there that team the tii team
[40:53] putting together the podcast brought all
[40:55] this energy and then a lot more people
[40:57] are being exposed to it now like the you
[41:00] know uh your your model or platform or
[41:03] method they have a little baby one and
[41:05] they're inspired by people like you that
[41:07] are helping educate people so so thank
[41:10] you for for that and and we're so
[41:12] excited to see how that's developed as
[41:15] well and and one thing that um people
[41:20] don't believe me especially people in
[41:22] Bitcoin but we need more Bitcoin
[41:23] podcasts um uh because people think like
[41:26] oh like they like five six seven or 10
[41:29] good ones already but then you have to
[41:33] look out of outside of the Bitcoin
[41:35] bubble how many crypto uh podcasts
[41:38] content creators Tik tokers are out
[41:40] there how many Finance
[41:42] Pros content creators Tik tokers
[41:44] YouTubers out there and then you see oh
[41:47] like we are like
[41:50] 0.011% and
[41:52] 99.99% of the other ones are saying uh
[41:56] crap
[41:58] uh and we have to increase that one I
[42:01] encourage everyone like I have some
[42:03] sometimes guests on that don't produce
[42:04] any content and they don't do anything I
[42:06] always say to like like do something
[42:09] have some format and if it's
[42:12] one3 second video per week that you post
[42:15] on Twitter that's great like like start
[42:18] somewhere if you're comfortable sharing
[42:20] your face and you are comfortable when
[42:21] you come on my podcast share with your
[42:23] face then you can share it more and and
[42:25] you can connect your your face with the
[42:28] Bitcoin message and what happens there
[42:30] you then become this orange digital
[42:33] soldier in this massive Financial
[42:36] Revolution uh and and that's the the the
[42:40] prod prods in arms that we need for this
[42:42] information war that that goes on every
[42:45] day H and so uh it's so funny I I got
[42:49] actually the question only once and I
[42:51] think a lot of people have um know why
[42:54] but I got this question was oh do do you
[42:56] have like competition with other
[42:58] podcasters no like I meet with for
[43:01] example Roger or prom or like other
[43:03] podcasts regularly and we are showing
[43:05] each other statistics of like oh like
[43:07] this has worked good for me this month
[43:09] this work like we are um we are
[43:12] colleagues we we in this together we we
[43:16] not competing for one another I know
[43:18] that my listeners most likely also watch
[43:21] his channel uh and His Channel or watch
[43:23] my channel uh and this is good we need
[43:26] the the Market is not with the the
[43:28] bitcoiners that are currently in there
[43:30] the market is the
[43:32] 99.999% that is still out there ntion
[43:35] Financial world so uh I encourage
[43:38] everyone uh and and I would like to do
[43:41] that every once in while on the podcast
[43:42] just like if you feel some courage in
[43:45] you that you get out your message like
[43:47] just do it and and see what happens and
[43:49] I think that's that's great what you're
[43:50] doing also we had a guy um his name's
[43:53] Brad he has a Canadian Bitcoin podcast
[43:57] and similar thing he he decided to leave
[44:00] the west and come move in changai and I
[44:03] said um and and I said hey well he came
[44:06] over and I'm like hey we should have a
[44:07] podcast he's like all my stuff's in in
[44:09] Canada still and I'm like but we have
[44:12] everything right here he's like really
[44:13] I'm like yeah I said and we have Neo who
[44:16] helps do a lot of audio and visual and
[44:17] editing and so we're like just pick a
[44:20] time and we're here you know let's do it
[44:22] and so we'll just give you the the audio
[44:24] and the video and you do what you do and
[44:27] he's like really like yeah I was like so
[44:28] it's a it's very cool to just and the
[44:31] backdrop is uh because I'm not at the
[44:34] office right now the backdrop is it's
[44:36] late here in Thailand uh is Bitcoin
[44:38] shangai and it's really nice Studio
[44:41] looking spot so we were able to give
[44:43] people and like um Joe Nakamoto was
[44:45] recently by same thing it's like you
[44:48] want to talk we got mics we got video we
[44:51] got all the things you guys need you
[44:53] know the the the boxes and the inverters
[44:55] and the wires um so
[44:57] that's a that was a really cool thing
[44:58] it's because it's not my jam and we
[45:00] have't any way to answer questions about
[45:03] the research or about what we're working
[45:05] on or the hill tribes or the mining so
[45:07] why not come here and do your H your
[45:09] your podcast so where we have the same
[45:11] thing as you like hey 30 minutes a week
[45:13] or one time come on by and and now even
[45:16] we have Brad that it's gonna come by
[45:17] again and we're gonna do it on a
[45:18] different floor because we've been
[45:19] building since his last one and we're
[45:21] going to talk about the Bitcoin marathon
[45:22] and Festival on his on his podcast for
[45:25] for the Canadian podcast so more the
[45:28] merrier so you are um almost always
[45:32] during the the office hours in in in the
[45:35] Learning Center and just welcoming
[45:37] people that randomly come by yes I love
[45:41] that that that's a really cool thing I I
[45:43] think we don't have that in Austria like
[45:46] I think there are there are some
[45:48] projects but I I researched once and we
[45:50] we we don't have that I'm really Envy of
[45:53] that there's like in the
[45:54] salador places like that I know in even
[45:58] in America there are some places I think
[46:00] Texas I forgot the name but they have
[46:02] some co-working space where you can just
[46:04] come as a Bitcoin and work there uh so
[46:06] there are really cool projects around
[46:09] the world going on uh and we need those
[46:12] physical places what do you think is the
[46:14] importance of having those those
[46:16] physical
[46:17] things it makes it more it makes it real
[46:20] like there's an infectious energy when
[46:22] bitcoiners get together and I think when
[46:25] there's a lot of them then ideas are
[46:27] flying just like the the Thai group put
[46:31] together the podcast and that's why
[46:33] we're having our major event our major
[46:36] Bitcoin meeting of 50 people on Saturday
[46:39] is because they got together physically
[46:41] and made something happen like look at
[46:43] that that's like exact proof of what
[46:44] you're saying is you know what do you
[46:45] think it is it's like wow look at that
[46:48] and now we get to say hey what are your
[46:50] strengths where do you work what do you
[46:52] do how can we help you know
[46:55] like we're all here we got 50 of you
[46:57] together like that's that's a big size I
[46:59] don't know what it's like in any other
[47:00] country because I'm so dialed into what
[47:02] we do here but like that's pretty
[47:04] awesome and that Synergy together and
[47:06] they Network and I know that like uh one
[47:08] guy that I was friends with another guy
[47:10] is an ultramarathon Runner this guy
[47:12] started training for ultramarathon
[47:14] because they got together they're
[47:15] bitcoiners they went hiking I ended up
[47:18] joining them on like a training one
[47:19] because I'm not that intense like
[47:21] there's cool relationships that are
[47:23] built and then we could learn about what
[47:25] you're doing and we could help we have a
[47:27] a guy coming on
[47:29] Saturday that helped uh like 15 or 20
[47:33] locations in a in a unique part of
[47:36] Thailand uh be start onboarding Bitcoin
[47:40] as a merchant so he's he's helped like
[47:42] 20 merchants in Ean Thailand and he's
[47:45] coming to talk about how he did that
[47:47] like how how such a small area so these
[47:51] things are like when you bring people
[47:53] together you could teach that lesson
[47:55] what we have people that come here here
[47:56] that just oh this is crazy thing Robin
[47:59] so someone we don't know who it is in
[48:02] Thailand I don't have to show you
[48:03] there's a QR you could pay for
[48:05] everything from a coconut to a water
[48:07] bottle to a car but I don't know about a
[48:10] car but you could spend $3,000 at least
[48:12] on a scanning everywhere you go everyone
[48:14] has a scan somebody figured
[48:17] out how to turn that into Bitcoin
[48:20] lightning address and you don't need so
[48:23] what it what it does is you could you
[48:25] you you go to a website called it's a
[48:29] website it's not an app that can get
[48:30] shut down it's called um pleb
[48:33] qr. and it says um pay or earn you click
[48:38] pay it opens up your camera it scans the
[48:40] item that you want to pay for so you
[48:42] don't have a Thai Bank you're Robin
[48:44] visiting
[48:45] Thailand and uh it instantly converts
[48:49] that amount into a lightning invoice you
[48:52] open up your lightning wallet you click
[48:54] pay it broadcasts it
[48:57] Simplex someone in Thailand gets the
[49:00] exact bill that you need to pay they pay
[49:03] for it they get a there you go uh so if
[49:07] you click on pay and you usually have to
[49:08] do it on a phone it'll open up a um uh
[49:11] probably because you're not on the phone
[49:14] um it'll it'll open up uh you try that
[49:16] see what happens yeah you it'll it'll
[49:19] open up your camera and all of a sudden
[49:21] um someone will pay that and it'll get
[49:23] confirmed and they will get um about 20
[49:27] bot or 60 cents for making that payment
[49:30] for you so you could literally come to
[49:32] Thailand now we don't know who this is
[49:35] they're being very careful about sharing
[49:37] who they are because there's potential
[49:40] issues with
[49:41] AML and uh SEC uh regulations so this
[49:46] but there's eight countries that have
[49:48] the same similar payment method and and
[49:52] I encourage everybody to uh give it a
[49:55] try and it's just some other people on
[49:57] the other end of simplex and this could
[49:59] totally be iterated down to be automated
[50:01] as much as possible I mean we could we
[50:04] could almost try it now um well probably
[50:06] shouldn't because it might take more
[50:07] than two minutes but so it takes about
[50:09] two minutes you don't want to do it at
[50:10] the grocery store where there's people
[50:11] behind you you go to a cafe or somewhere
[50:13] that you like to frequent it takes about
[50:15] two minutes and uh and then you you
[50:19] capture uh you could screenshot who sent
[50:21] the payment so you can show the merchant
[50:22] if they have if they want a receipt and
[50:24] then you put in your your lightning
[50:25] address in case
[50:27] it gets cancelled or it doesn't go
[50:28] through it gets
[50:30] refunded so the Thai Community doesn't
[50:33] really want doesn't talk too much about
[50:35] it because it's a little bit like gray
[50:37] area I talk about it because people come
[50:39] into the office and they're like hey
[50:41] does there any peer-to peer you know I'm
[50:43] like I don't really know but you could
[50:44] use Bitcoin lightning everywhere you go
[50:45] they're like what like wait I could use
[50:48] Bitcoin lightning every single place
[50:50] every single Merchant in Thailand and
[50:53] the answer is
[50:55] yes and it only takes two minutes it's
[50:57] really fun to do especially if you're a
[50:59] bitcoiner yeah you'll pay an extra 60
[51:02] cents or you could choose the slow
[51:05] version which I believe is only five
[51:07] cents but I don't know maybe you don't
[51:08] want to wait a minute and it's just
[51:10] getting faster and faster so I also on
[51:12] the um other side of it where I could
[51:15] see the could see the payments going
[51:17] through so
[51:19] um Simplex so I could just see I could
[51:23] pretty much just see like if if I I've
[51:26] never been able capture one because uh
[51:28] it's so fast that the guys the guys do
[51:31] uh they capture it so quickly uh but
[51:34] pleb QR you can see it here this is how
[51:37] it broadcasts and this is what it looks
[51:38] like and know it's probably backwards
[51:39] because we're on the screen like this
[51:41] but it comes through it tells you how
[51:42] much uh it is how much the reward is so
[51:45] you'll see like 20 20 Tai bot if you do
[51:48] this reward that that was four bot um
[51:52] and so I I just chose to see the other
[51:54] side of it so I could see how it all
[51:55] works but it's actually not that
[51:57] complicated and hopefully maybe some of
[51:59] your listeners will help figure that out
[52:01] and I also want to help have encourage
[52:03] someone to figure it out in case
[52:05] something happens to this because it's
[52:07] just such a wonderful
[52:09] solution and I think we will see a lot
[52:11] of those um
[52:15] nonky self- custodial lightning onchain
[52:20] Solutions uh in ways where you can just
[52:23] spend Bitcoin and and use it
[52:25] peer-to-peer
[52:26] and and you don't have to go through all
[52:28] the Hoops it's it's like actually kind
[52:31] of kind of nice because uh I for example
[52:35] accept payments in Bitcoin and send
[52:37] payments in Bitcoin every month now a
[52:39] year ago I never received any Bitcoin
[52:41] payments and I never sent any Bitcoin
[52:43] payments now a year later I I do it Mo
[52:47] like most of my volume uh my business
[52:50] volume goes through Bitcoin I am a good
[52:54] citizen I report everything to the tax
[52:55] agencies don't want to get in Pro
[52:57] problems and stuff like that but
[52:59] honestly I could choose not to because I
[53:02] get it non KC I give it non KC it's all
[53:06] in Bitcoin never touches feared it it
[53:09] nobody had to to to care about it and
[53:12] they don't they don't have to know about
[53:13] it uh but I I I choose to be a good
[53:16] citizen maybe naively you know it's
[53:18] inevitable we know it's inevitable right
[53:21] so so
[53:22] like in Thailand the big thing is right
[53:25] now
[53:27] there's a what they're calling the
[53:29] digital currency sandbox that's
[53:31] happening this year and since Thailand
[53:33] gets a lot of its GDP from tourism
[53:35] they're exploring uh accepting crypto
[53:38] and Bitcoin payments in a specific
[53:40] region called
[53:42] puket uh it's sometime between now and
[53:45] November so this is huge this is huge
[53:49] they know it's coming they want to
[53:51] capitalize on it it makes sense you know
[53:53] this is the the future so we decided
[53:56] this year that we want to help support
[53:58] that you know we want we want to help uh
[54:01] encourage you Thailand to become a a
[54:04] leader in digital Innovation especially
[54:07] in Bitcoin and we want to make sure that
[54:09] we're pushing extra hard this year to
[54:11] separate the differences between what
[54:13] the exchanges are showing and what
[54:15] Bitcoin is because you know the
[54:17] exchanges don't just show you the
[54:19] Bitcoin they show you all the other
[54:20] fancy colorful things so this is why so
[54:25] uh the B we're having a Bitcoin marathon
[54:27] and Festival in November and what's
[54:29] really unique and we and And the tagline
[54:31] of of the Bitcoin marathon is Run For
[54:33] Freedom so like the ideal perfect title
[54:37] partner for this event and there's 3,000
[54:39] to 5,000 Runners and over 10,000
[54:42] Festival goers so this is a massive
[54:44] opportunity to expose people to bitcoin
[54:47] bring awareness but we but and and and
[54:50] the Tailwinds of what Thailand's doing
[54:53] so we want to help Thailand be the front
[54:54] runner in in Asia so one unique thing
[54:58] yeah you go to you can see there um one
[55:01] unique thing about it is that since it's
[55:04] Run For Freedom we really you know
[55:07] someone like the human rights Foundation
[55:09] tether these are like perfect title
[55:12] partners and the exchanges it's it's
[55:15] it's it's almost like since it's since
[55:17] it's not geared for bitcoiners
[55:19] specifically it's more for um the
[55:22] general audience this is students this
[55:24] is entrepreneurs this is athletes this
[55:26] is families uh it's a side of the ly
[55:28] cron Festival one really unique
[55:31] opportunity is to teach them about
[55:33] Bitcoin so instead of having a bunch of
[55:36] like you know uh potential exchanges
[55:40] that are going to put up their fancy
[55:42] colorful coins maybe we could just have
[55:46] a few hard you know quality Bitcoin and
[55:49] luckily we're controlling the whole
[55:51] process we have a race organizer that's
[55:53] done the top one in Thailand of 30 years
[55:56] uh so that's how we know we're going to
[55:57] have over 3,000 Runners of participants
[56:00] and then we have a professional Festival
[56:02] event partner so we get to control the
[56:06] sponsors so we don't want we don't want
[56:09] like it's digital the whole the screens
[56:11] are digital so we don't want to lose the
[56:13] message we want the message to be run
[56:15] for
[56:16] Freedom you know and and learn about
[56:19] Bitcoin so we believe this time you know
[56:23] we we're talking with banks but like
[56:25] again I don't want you know we we really
[56:27] want to be very delicate about who we
[56:29] choose and that's very hard to do when
[56:31] it's you know cost 300 thou three 10
[56:35] million bot which is like
[56:37] $300,000 so to be selective your first
[56:40] year trying to organize the world's
[56:43] first Bitcoin
[56:44] marathon is very difficult so yet well
[56:48] we we don't want to say no we will say
[56:50] if we have exchanges like the two larger
[56:52] exchanges out here we're going you know
[56:55] once we get through the process say
[56:56] we're going to request that they focus
[56:58] on the message of Bitcoin because we I I
[57:02] just don't want like the mood Dangs or
[57:04] whatever these things are you know I
[57:06] don't want someone to think that there's
[57:08] a different Bitcoin so luckily we're
[57:10] controlling that process we're so
[57:12] excited it's in November so if you're
[57:13] still looking to explore what it's like
[57:15] to be in Thailand you know we we invite
[57:18] you to come on out Robin and we're going
[57:20] to have a big party then the funny thing
[57:22] is we didn't we didn't plan it they told
[57:24] us this is the dates that it has to be
[57:27] because there's massive marathons in
[57:29] Thailand because it it's got this
[57:31] picturesque natural beauty and like you
[57:35] know it's it's where it uh the the
[57:37] history comes together and the culture
[57:39] it's really a big Running Place Hoka
[57:44] just had their UTMB in December of like
[57:47] five or 10 thousand people so it's a
[57:49] really popular place but but yeah if you
[57:51] come out it's a it's a it's a great time
[57:54] to to to check out Thailand and Northern
[57:57] Thailand really cool I I I definitely
[58:00] maybe not this year but uh Thailand is
[58:02] on on my list anyways to to places to
[58:06] live and places to to to visit um I
[58:09] think it's it's really interesting um is
[58:12] there how far is this the Bitcoin
[58:14] adoption in Thailand in general like
[58:16] there there is seems to be a lot of
[58:18] Grassroots movement in a lot of
[58:20] bitcoiners maybe also some noise with
[58:23] crypto but at least they are some some
[58:26] way on the solution you know there is a
[58:29] team called right shift they're tie
[58:32] bitcoiners they've been around a while
[58:34] they're out of Bangkok and they do an
[58:37] exceptional job at getting the message
[58:40] and and they they really penetrate all
[58:43] the BS and they're louder than all the
[58:46] crypto stuff and while we don't have big
[58:51] adoption numbers I do think that when
[58:54] people are listening to Bitcoin crypto
[58:57] it goes quickly to what they're doing
[58:59] and they're Relentless like you they
[59:01] just are constant on it there's a team
[59:04] of 20 of them they volunteer they're
[59:06] super passionate we team up with them we
[59:09] collaborate with them um they're on the
[59:12] on the the local new Thai podcast
[59:14] together too
[59:15] so while I'm not sure of the adoption
[59:19] numbers I am sure of of the garbage
[59:22] that's out there and uh it doesn't
[59:24] nearly get the viewers sh that cuz I
[59:28] don't know there's just um you know
[59:30] they're they're so far down the rabbit
[59:32] hole they make fun of people and they're
[59:34] fun with it and like and they and
[59:36] they're really they put it together well
[59:39] and they've they've translated like um
[59:42] the Bitcoin standard the Fiat standard
[59:45] um uh inventing Bitcoin um another
[59:48] book's been been also translated so so
[59:51] that's important um but but it's not
[59:54] enough you know um
[59:56] my my message on Saturday is how can we
[59:59] reach you know um awareness and
[60:03] uh not adoption but you know being
[60:06] making aware a million people exposing a
[60:09] million people to bitcoin like what
[60:11] would that take and if there's a hundred
[60:13] of us and you know how many thousands of
[60:15] people and like you know what you know
[60:18] even if you just even if you know 10,000
[60:21] people talk do some type of education or
[60:24] get us in uh if you could reach anyway a
[60:28] corporation another school anything we
[60:30] could do together to try to just get to
[60:32] that number and I just choose a million
[60:34] because that's one and a half percent of
[60:35] the population and that's reasonable
[60:38] goal and even with the Bitcoin marathon
[60:40] and Festival that's
[60:43] 15,000 so you know we're already you
[60:45] know that's just being exposed a touch
[60:47] point in their Journey so we're not
[60:50] trying to say you know force it and make
[60:52] people learn but let's try to you know
[60:56] reach as many people as possible so we
[60:58] thought that method is a great method
[61:00] just massive big Bitcoin Marathon you
[61:03] know and try to get that that's a huge
[61:05] one and try to get the get move the move
[61:09] the needle because it is the grassroot
[61:11] efforts that are going to move the
[61:12] needle H so while adoption is not strong
[61:16] like we want it to be um we are we're
[61:20] trying to be the voice and we're trying
[61:21] to encourage others to be the voice too
[61:23] I love that I love that a lot um
[61:26] unfortunately we're already coming close
[61:27] to the end of the podcast I have one
[61:29] more thing that I want to touch on you
[61:31] you just mention it briefly uh but you
[61:35] have some previous project some company
[61:38] that now is uh ran by someone else the
[61:40] meal plan delivery uh thing what what is
[61:45] it and what I'm even more interested in
[61:48] what have you learned from that that
[61:50] you're now uh uh doing with with Bitcoin
[61:53] what are you now bringing from that to
[61:55] to bitcoin
[61:56] sure so uh meal plan delivery is uh
[62:00] we're a logistics company for prepared
[62:02] food companies so like he healthy uh
[62:06] food companies that have subscribers so
[62:10] we are actually at the the secret people
[62:12] that deliver it uh We've delivered in 24
[62:15] different markets over the last 12 years
[62:17] from the west coast of America to the
[62:19] east coast and South uh that in Miami 24
[62:23] different markets I think 12 different
[62:25] states
[62:26] so we deliver prepared food um what I've
[62:29] learned from that is to get out of the
[62:31] way and get smarter people around me
[62:33] that are stronger than me in areas that
[62:36] I'm not that strong in so uh you know I
[62:39] got smarter operators and smarter
[62:41] accounting and smarter management that
[62:44] are more organized and more detail
[62:46] oriented and then I help Drive the big
[62:48] picture uh and so I took that strength
[62:52] that I have uh as I became a bitcoiner
[62:55] uh first bought Bitcoin in
[62:58] 2017 uh really really LED on of Bitcoin
[63:01] uh in 2020 and uh it just shifted
[63:05] everything about the way that I see the
[63:06] world uh it's changed everything it's
[63:09] changed every there isn't anything that
[63:11] it hasn't changed about about me so I
[63:14] just take that passion of of learning
[63:17] and knowing your strength and knowing
[63:19] your weakness and then help guiding and
[63:21] Building A team out here and our team is
[63:24] like we we are rapidly growing and I and
[63:27] I really want people to come and see it
[63:28] especially if you're listening to this
[63:29] and you're coming to Southeast Asia and
[63:31] you're coming through Thailand like come
[63:33] and see this because it's got legs it's
[63:36] got a lot of energy and it's infectious
[63:39] to be around this much activity so I've
[63:41] learned to
[63:43] just set the stage and let everybody
[63:45] play nice together and and and that
[63:47] seemed to work well in my Fiat world and
[63:50] that seems to be working quite well in
[63:52] in in what we're building here and
[63:54] Bitcoin it works uh probably even even
[63:56] better as you as you said that it's like
[63:59] it's great like and there are there's so
[64:01] many hyper smart people in Bitcoin it's
[64:04] it's it's fascinating to see um one
[64:07] question that I asked each and every one
[64:08] of my guests is what can we learn from
[64:10] you besides Bitcoin prep for this
[64:14] right I would say take risks you know I
[64:19] I know you Pro a lot of people hear it a
[64:20] lot but like we are young and like there
[64:23] is a a world coming that we're building
[64:26] and and it's difficult to try something
[64:29] new but you're not going to know unless
[64:31] you do it and and part of that is
[64:33] traveling and you know get out and
[64:36] experience it and if it and if it
[64:37] doesn't work for you then you could go
[64:39] you could go back to where you were but
[64:40] you're not going to know unless you give
[64:41] it a try so I think that that's that's
[64:44] one thing that you could learn is is
[64:46] travel test it taste it and see how it
[64:48] feels and you don't know what might be
[64:50] on the other side I love that message
[64:52] really cool um thank you so much uh we
[64:55] have
[64:56] um one more entro te in the in the
[64:58] podcast where the the previous guest is
[65:00] asking a question for the next guest
[65:02] without knowing who the next guest is
[65:04] and I think the this question could be a
[65:07] whole another podcast um but uh you
[65:10] already teased it a little bit the
[65:12] question from the previous guest is what
[65:14] is the biggest impact that Bitcoin had
[65:16] on your own life besides the financial
[65:19] aspect of it for me it was
[65:21] health
[65:23] I I want to see what this looks like
[65:27] what we're building and I want to be
[65:29] healthy I want to be clearheaded I want
[65:32] to be aware you know I I just want to be
[65:36] strong I wanna I want to just I want to
[65:39] see I I really believe what we're
[65:42] building together as a global Community
[65:45] is so powerful that it would be so sad
[65:48] to have the regret of being way
[65:50] overweight or or or not being active or
[65:53] or not giving it not trying something
[65:55] new new or or trying to build something
[65:58] I don't want that regret I want to see
[66:01] what a world looks like so I say get
[66:04] healthy you know find something that
[66:07] you're interested in and be inspired
[66:10] about whatever that is you're interested
[66:11] in and just add a Sprinkle a little
[66:13] Bitcoin on top of that and see what
[66:15] happens Vitality is everything like you
[66:18] you have to like you you have to have
[66:20] the vitality and I really feel that with
[66:23] you a lot um really cool thank you so
