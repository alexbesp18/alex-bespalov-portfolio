[00:00] if you can't shut it down forcefully
[00:02] eventually everyone has to adopt it and
[00:03] you're seeing that with countries you're
[00:05] seeing that with companies you're seeing
[00:06] that with AI the FED now pivoted and
[00:08] instead of raising rates they stopped
[00:10] and now they're dropping and so they're
[00:11] going to be dropping continuously until
[00:13] the end of 2025 that's going to increase
[00:16] the money supply like crazy liquidity is
[00:18] going to be up we're probably going to
[00:19] get to 200,000 we don't even need to
[00:21] transfer US dollars from a bank account
[00:23] to a reserve in Bitcoin because we
[00:25] already get paid in Bitcoin we are
[00:27] accepting Bitcoin directly and we are
[00:30] circumventing and avoiding using Banks
[00:32] 20% of our sales are already in Bitcoin
[00:35] when education is funded by the
[00:36] government when health is funded by the
[00:38] government when everything is funded by
[00:40] the government we start losing control
[00:41] of our individual sovereignty the dollar
[00:43] has lost 95% of its purchasing power
[00:46] since 1938 back then a father could work
[00:50] a 9 to-5 job with about eight kids sent
[00:52] at home and a wife who's not working and
[00:54] taking care of those kids and be well
[00:56] off well why is that most people will be
[00:58] using Bitcoin without even know and
[01:00] they're using Bitcoin the current system
[01:01] makes us very selfish High Time
[01:03] preference we need stuff now I need to
[01:05] get my nice new car it's going to be a
[01:07] crazy shift man for those who do own
[01:09] Bitcoin even if it's
[01:11] [Music]
[01:15] 0.1 what makes Bitcoin so special for
[01:19] you that you even go ahead and create an
[01:21] exclusive watch print with
[01:23] it yeah so I would say part of the
[01:26] reason why I decided to do a you know
[01:28] exclusive Limited Editions of Bitcoin
[01:30] watches is my passion for for Bitcoin um
[01:34] you know when I was in college I was
[01:36] trying to figure out what was wrong with
[01:38] the current system um I could just tell
[01:40] that something was off lots of printing
[01:42] of trillions of dollars you know expans
[01:45] money supply and I couldn't figure it
[01:48] out until I ran across Bitcoin and once
[01:52] I ran into that it hit a light bulb
[01:53] moment and so for me you know I'm not an
[01:57] expert um but I call myself a pleb who
[02:00] at least understands the basics of
[02:02] what's wrong with this current system
[02:04] that we live in and what the solution is
[02:06] and to me it's very simple from a macro
[02:10] perspective we finally have something
[02:12] that protects our purchasing power um
[02:15] initially think about this it's kind of
[02:17] weird because what what's I think it's
[02:19] about 10 to 12 years in existence for
[02:21] Bitcoin I don't even know um not very
[02:23] long and so I discovered it what is it
[02:27] 2017 so I don't know about six seven
[02:30] years ago um and back then we didn't
[02:34] know if it was going to be a something
[02:36] that holds your purchasing power right I
[02:37] mean we we only had like a six-year
[02:39] sample right and so but the thing that
[02:42] caught my eye was wait a minute it's
[02:45] decentralized it's peer-to-peer it's
[02:48] immutable
[02:50] permissionless and it's scarce so it's
[02:54] all the things that you know the current
[02:56] system doesn't give us and so that
[02:58] gravitated you know me into into it you
[03:00] know I didn't even know if it was going
[03:01] to hold purchasing power but to me just
[03:03] just thinking wait I can send someone in
[03:05] another country some money and no bank
[03:09] is involved this is just crazy so that
[03:11] was a light bulb moment to me and to me
[03:14] I wanted to create something special
[03:16] that would signify my passion for it and
[03:19] you know with that we have the Bitcoin
[03:20] watches as you have seen uh in the show
[03:23] hopefully but uh yeah I mean that that's
[03:25] a little bit of a start as to how and
[03:27] and why I wanted to create watches and
[03:29] what my passion is for Bitcoin to start
[03:32] I I love that a lot and I think your
[03:34] brand even evolved and probably also uh
[03:37] your knowledge and on bitcoin also
[03:38] evolved because I saw some some early
[03:40] videos that you made and and where you
[03:43] also made Litecoin videos and now you
[03:45] actually switch to bitcoin only it's
[03:47] actually like the first time uh we got
[03:49] in contact I was seeing it I was like oh
[03:51] no he has also other watches then I
[03:54] cannot work with him and I was like no
[03:55] okay he's Bitcoin only now uh where
[03:59] where did the Fus to bitcoin only come
[04:01] from where like okay like okay it's not
[04:03] not other things like I I really want to
[04:06] focus on on on bitcoin solely which is
[04:08] really I think an important step yeah um
[04:13] initially you know and I think most
[04:15] people that are watching this you know
[04:17] they were never or most likely not
[04:19] Bitcoin only to start um and that was me
[04:22] um it was a lot of coins it was still a
[04:25] battle for projects to figure out what
[04:27] was going to be sound money what was
[04:29] going to be the one and evidently it's
[04:31] you know Bitcoin you know if you're
[04:33] holding any other coin or any other
[04:35] project over the past four years I mean
[04:36] you're down and ultimately the reason
[04:39] why Litecoin uh and I'll probably get
[04:41] burned for this for from the Litecoin
[04:43] Community um they're they're a great
[04:44] community and their their goal is to try
[04:47] to find a peer-to-peer medium of
[04:51] exchange that's cheap to transact so
[04:54] Lyin is great at that but in terms of
[04:57] holding your purchasing power it it
[04:59] really has not um it it's not a store of
[05:02] value and it hasn't been and it's
[05:04] because that's not it it's its goal um
[05:07] and it it has played a role in bitcoin's
[05:10] history like for example I think the
[05:11] first lightning uh payment for for that
[05:15] was tested with uh uh Charlie Lee so the
[05:19] creator of Litecoin right so he's always
[05:21] been deeply involved with with Bitcoin
[05:23] and I I do have to say um you know I do
[05:28] appreciate that Community a lot because
[05:29] it was a community it's people you know
[05:31] it it at the end of the day it's people
[05:33] that ended up supporting us and helping
[05:35] us and I'm not one to to just be
[05:37] negative and Bash on people just because
[05:39] they like one thing or another uh we can
[05:41] disagree on things but I'm I'm I'm
[05:43] always a positive guy we can be friendly
[05:45] you know um but you know I realize hey
[05:48] you know it's Bitcoin that is going to
[05:50] win the game at the end I mean it really
[05:52] is um there's going to be tons of
[05:54] options out there um for speculation but
[05:58] when it comes to story boring value long
[06:03] term it's Bitcoin and it's the most
[06:07] secure um it's the largest you know in
[06:10] terms in terms of Game Theory you know
[06:12] it's already winning the game and I do
[06:14] believe that in the future we're going
[06:15] to see a more of a Bitcoin standard more
[06:17] companies are going to adopt it uh more
[06:20] countries are going to adopt it they're
[06:21] going to use it as a reserve and so you
[06:23] know I was thinking about these things
[06:24] and I'm like hey if I want to build a
[06:26] brand that is going to last a long time
[06:30] and something that I'm deeply passionate
[06:31] and I mean to me it only makes sense to
[06:35] to do Bitcoin only now again I'm not
[06:38] hating on the Lyin Community they're
[06:40] great um but that's a little bit of a
[06:43] you know that explanation I guess yeah
[06:46] it's uh it's it's so interesting because
[06:48] I was also deeply in shitcoin and I talk
[06:52] very open about it and um I I still am
[06:57] watching the the shitcoin social media
[06:59] account from time to time like well
[07:01] let's see how it does and I'm like okay
[07:03] they are still promising the same thing
[07:04] they promised like three years ago they
[07:06] still didn't do it it's really
[07:07] interesting I mean mine was really
[07:09] really really [ __ ] coining like that
[07:11] that was like deep meme
[07:13] shitcoin nothing like that you you also
[07:17] uh I mean to a certain extent I know it
[07:20] because we transact for the partnership
[07:22] in in Bitcoin but to to what extent has
[07:24] the business coin vigilante already
[07:27] adopted a Bitcoin standard so that's one
[07:30] thing that uh we're doing so for example
[07:33] uh a big part of our reserve for our
[07:35] balance sheet is Bitcoin um and and and
[07:38] part of it is is because sometimes we
[07:40] don't even need to transfer US dollars
[07:42] from a bank account to a reserve in
[07:44] Bitcoin because we already get paid in
[07:46] Bitcoin so that's the beauty think about
[07:48] it so you know we
[07:51] are accepting Bitcoin directly and we
[07:54] are
[07:55] circumventing and avoiding using Banks
[07:59] being the third party for that
[08:01] transaction and it's crazy so people are
[08:03] literally buying our watches and goods
[08:05] and services which is paying with
[08:08] Bitcoin and so I know that a lot of
[08:10] people say don't use your Bitcoin look
[08:13] uh I'll tell you right now that probably
[08:15] about 20% of our sales are already in
[08:17] Bitcoin and so people do like to use it
[08:20] people like to spend it sometimes and
[08:22] again it's about that new economy so
[08:25] when I think of
[08:27] Bitcoin it's it's not
[08:31] sometimes what we like to think of is
[08:33] like it's just coins kind of like in a
[08:34] video game and you have a coin and then
[08:36] you send it here and then it no no no no
[08:38] no we got to think a little bit bigger
[08:40] we have to think of a system it's a
[08:41] protocol and it's a software so either
[08:45] we're going to be
[08:47] using the super centralized shitcoin
[08:51] banking system where it's a third party
[08:54] they can close your account it takes
[08:56] multiple days to clear a transaction um
[08:59] you know they're basically lending your
[09:01] money anyway so it's not even your money
[09:04] the moment that hits the bank or we're
[09:06] GNA opt in into the alternative which is
[09:09] Bitcoin and that is
[09:11] decentralized that offers a peer-to-peer
[09:14] protocol a system in which you can
[09:17] transfer value right so we're using the
[09:19] Bitcoin protocol we're not just sending
[09:21] coins you know what I mean so to me I
[09:23] like to to think of it that way I'm
[09:25] using we're using this system at coin
[09:28] vigilante to store value and to transfer
[09:32] value that's the way I see it I love
[09:35] that 20% I think that's high honestly I
[09:37] was like probably like five to 10% at
[09:39] least that that's the numbers that I
[09:41] always hear from from from other people
[09:43] and they're like oh like no we we we
[09:46] don't want to do it because it's a
[09:47] hustle and something if you're doing
[09:48] something with Bitcoin you have to
[09:49] accept Bitcoin as as payments and I know
[09:52] it was for me as a big hustle like I uh
[09:55] accepted from the Bitcoin way the first
[09:57] actual Bitcoin payment uh in in in in
[10:00] Bitcoin I was like oh gosh like how is
[10:02] it working with taxes what to have to
[10:04] figure out and it's so easy when you
[10:07] really like research you research like
[10:08] an hour and you're like okay like I
[10:10] don't have to do anything for that
[10:11] actually just have to buy like one tool
[10:13] so I can accept it and I have to tell my
[10:16] uh my accountant that I do that and it's
[10:18] pretty easy and straightforward actually
[10:20] yeah yeah it's not it's not very hard
[10:22] people make it sound a lot more
[10:24] difficult and honestly living in the
[10:26] Bitcoin standard and learning how to use
[10:28] Bitcoin is a lot easier than than the
[10:29] current Financial system um it's very
[10:32] complicated and they make it very
[10:34] complicated for a reason okay I was in
[10:36] college taking an international business
[10:39] degree and not once in my economics
[10:42] classes that I took did I learn of how
[10:45] money is printed they didn't explain
[10:47] very much about how the Federal Reserve
[10:49] was created um which was created in jaal
[10:53] Island you know about a 100 years ago
[10:56] and it was created by some of the
[10:58] wealthiest people who controlled
[10:59] probably about 40% of the wealth in the
[11:01] world and it was these
[11:03] bankers and I think it was a a a person
[11:07] from Congress who also met in a very
[11:09] private meeting and they were trying to
[11:11] figure out how to
[11:12] create an entity a financial entity that
[11:15] is actually separate from the government
[11:18] and how to centralize money because back
[11:21] then there were thousands of banks okay
[11:24] so you could actually argue that you
[11:26] know it was a competitive almost kind of
[11:28] like free market in terms of lending in
[11:30] terms of borrowing in terms of just
[11:32] Banking and they created basically
[11:35] monopolized money to where there would
[11:37] be no competition they can control rates
[11:41] they can control the flow of money they
[11:44] can control control everything expans
[11:47] monetary policy Contracting monetary
[11:49] policy and
[11:50] so it's just nuts um and I think I'm
[11:54] kind of deviating here from what we're
[11:56] even talking about but it's part of the
[11:58] reason why I'm so like
[11:59] deep in Bitcoin dude because people have
[12:03] no understanding of the current
[12:05] Financial system um that they don't even
[12:08] want you to know and going back to
[12:12] college you know there's a who who who
[12:15] funds College okay at least in the in
[12:17] the US well even even in you uh Austria
[12:21] right yeah yeah like uh colleges are all
[12:23] funded by the government okay exactly so
[12:27] um and who prints the money there are
[12:30] there are of course private entities and
[12:32] private university but it's like a
[12:33] smaller percent especially in Austria
[12:36] but for example here you know if you
[12:37] want to go to college you can take out a
[12:39] loan back by the federal by the federal
[12:42] government so the government will cover
[12:43] your loan so whether that's $200,000
[12:47] over four years or $50,000 over four
[12:49] years it doesn't matter and it's backed
[12:51] by the government and so the
[12:54] government you know is wanting you to go
[12:56] to college and there are also printing
[12:59] money and they're also using that to be
[13:01] able to allow you to go to college and
[13:03] obviously they have an agenda in place
[13:06] with that education so we live in a
[13:09] matrix and we are that when education is
[13:13] funded by the government when health is
[13:15] funded by the government when when
[13:17] everything is funded by the government
[13:18] you know we start losing control of our
[13:20] individual sovereignty and so it's part
[13:23] of the reason why people don't really
[13:25] understand the problem as it is because
[13:26] the system doesn't allow you to so so
[13:30] it's tough I'm trying to convince people
[13:31] to buy Bitcoin I'm trying to even right
[13:34] now I'm like hey guys I'm telling you
[13:36] right now you know you everything's just
[13:39] getting more expensive around you not
[13:41] just inflation which is you know CPI
[13:45] core inflation so it's just consumers
[13:47] and goods you know everything we are
[13:49] seeing a huge debasement we're seeing
[13:52] assets get more expensive we're seeing
[13:55] you know everything get more expensive
[13:57] but they don't get it they don't want to
[13:58] get it and they're too comfortable and
[14:00] it's something that worries me man but I
[14:01] mean what what are your thoughts I mean
[14:03] I I I have I've always struggled to get
[14:06] close friends and family to just want a
[14:08] deep dive into Bitcoin it's it's it's
[14:11] it's a hustle um I mean I want to go
[14:14] back to the colleges also but first uh
[14:16] the the orange pilling is hard uh it's
[14:19] it's something that you cannot force
[14:21] some people uh I tried it in the
[14:23] beginning and I completely completely
[14:24] failed um it's something that has to
[14:27] come from within a person
[14:30] um and they they will come I had a
[14:32] lovely couple uh who is far far family
[14:36] like a from my girlfriend's friend their
[14:38] Uncle something like that and they
[14:41] wanted to have like a meeting with me uh
[14:43] and talk about Bitcoin and it was so
[14:45] lovely because there's like two really
[14:47] normal people uh in the 50s 60s uh and
[14:51] they were loving it and they were just
[14:54] like okay but we we think the Euro might
[14:57] not have a future we we are a little bit
[14:59] concerned so we want to diversify and I
[15:02] was like so I was so proud of them in
[15:05] that moment that like two completely
[15:07] normal people who have normal ass jobs
[15:10] like completely normal uh and they're
[15:12] like I don't know if the Euro hasn't
[15:15] future and I was like okay I know that
[15:17] Euro has no future and that's why I'm in
[15:20] Bitcoin and that's why they slowly
[15:22] diversify and they're not like jumping
[15:24] in directly so I think you have to wait
[15:27] till till they actually come and for the
[15:29] colleges what I wanted to say is um in
[15:31] Austria it's even worse because uh in
[15:35] America you at least have to pay for the
[15:38] university in Austria most universities
[15:41] are free like literally you can go there
[15:44] you can sign up and it's free 100% it's
[15:47] actually the pay you to be a student in
[15:49] a way because you get so many incentives
[15:52] you get cheaper Transportation you get
[15:54] cheaper gym membership you get cheaper
[15:56] things if you have with the student pass
[15:58] uh uh and and are enrolled in a
[16:01] university and you have to pay nothing
[16:03] for that so I'm always interesting
[16:05] because the uh when I talk with
[16:08] Americans they are way more aware of how
[16:11] bad it is when the government is funding
[16:12] the
[16:13] universities but in America it's not
[16:15] even that bad like it's bad but it's not
[16:17] that bad especially how it's in Europe
[16:20] is so that that's really that that
[16:22] that's really funny funny to see and
[16:24] also one thing uh that you brought up
[16:27] with the central banks that this um uh
[16:29] Elite group brought brought into our
[16:31] lives uh the rich people brought into
[16:33] our lives it's so funny when you see now
[16:36] socialists arguing for central banks
[16:39] that I think the the irony of that is is
[16:41] pretty funny yeah it's it's ridiculous
[16:44] but I mean I think you bring a good
[16:45] point which is you know and we both
[16:47] agree is it first that couple that you
[16:50] were talking to didn't want to even
[16:52] think about Bitcoin until they learned
[16:54] the problem right you mentioned well
[16:56] something's going on with the Euro
[16:57] what's going on so think it always has
[16:59] to start with at least being aware of
[17:01] the problem um but part of the problem
[17:04] with people figuring that out is they're
[17:06] too comfortable they can't see it so and
[17:08] the reason is dude there I mean whoever
[17:10] created like I wish I could have
[17:12] invested into like I wish the FED had a
[17:15] ticker initially to where I could invest
[17:18] in them because they're so clever in how
[17:20] they like created this that no one's
[17:23] figured it out like I mean
[17:25] it's basically it's a hidden tax so it
[17:29] it is we are paying the price there no
[17:31] one else is paying the price not the
[17:33] government not the elite we're playing
[17:35] paying the price the bottom 70% for them
[17:37] to keep playing the game so we we
[17:40] currently live in a in a money system
[17:45] that has to continuously expand the
[17:47] money supply okay M2 money supply has to
[17:51] go up in order to keep covering the debt
[17:53] that they took last year right so it's a
[17:57] debt system so every time there's a
[18:00] deficit you know they got to keep paying
[18:02] that deficit and all those loans by
[18:04] taking on more debt now where they're
[18:08] able to do that is because we all pay
[18:09] for it that money is created and we're
[18:12] seeing a debasement of the currency year
[18:15] over year over year so let me I actually
[18:18] wrote some notes because I it was just
[18:19] blowing my mind lately so let me just
[18:23] ask you this let's see if you even know
[18:24] and it's actually not I don't know I I
[18:26] want to see what you you come up with
[18:28] but in the US at least the average
[18:30] median home in the US has increased in
[18:33] price since 1940 by about how much
[18:35] percent so 1940 till 2024 what do you
[18:38] think is a percentage of average median
[18:40] home in oh man that that's don't look it
[18:43] up that that has to be huge like what
[18:47] time span is this how many years uh like
[18:49] since from like 80 80 years oh like that
[18:53] has to be thousands of percent right
[18:56] it's 14,000 per. 14,000 yeah I F has to
[19:00] be something in F that's the average
[19:03] okay median home so the other thing is
[19:07] that I was looking at okay cars 5,500
[19:11] per. uh S&P 500 49,000 per. okay so what
[19:17] has been the common theme since the
[19:19] 1940s essentially shortly after the
[19:22] Federal Reserve was created is that in
[19:25] order to stay alive in this world world
[19:29] you have to invest in assets there is no
[19:32] other way okay so we have lost the
[19:35] dollar has lost 95% of his purchasing
[19:38] power since the 1938 it's that crazy
[19:43] dude so but it it it sucks
[19:46] because
[19:48] people like back then a single a father
[19:53] could work a 9 to-5 job with about eight
[19:57] kids sent at home and a wife who's not
[19:59] working and taking care of those kids
[20:02] and be well off well why is that because
[20:06] that's how it should have been when you
[20:08] have you know a store of value when you
[20:11] have Sounder money okay when you know
[20:14] the dollar and the economy was backed by
[20:17] something relatively scarce which is
[20:20] gold that the government can't play with
[20:23] right and so right now people are poor
[20:27] dude like PE like it is like the younger
[20:30] generation is basically
[20:33] [ __ ] there is no other way I mean it
[20:36] it's it's it's such an unfortunate thing
[20:38] that we've been seeing and people don't
[20:40] care about it um and but people always
[20:43] argue this but wait a minute dude what
[20:44] are you talking about wages have
[20:46] increased as well yeah 3,300
[20:50] per. so it's not keeping up with
[20:52] everything else now lately we finally
[20:55] have something which is Bitcoin and
[20:56] that's why I I I try to get people to
[20:58] like think you know think about it like
[21:01] Bitcoin since its existence has grown
[21:03] exponentially and the annualized average
[21:06] rate of return over the past five years
[21:09] has been about
[21:10] 55% if you're just averaging it you know
[21:13] what I mean so obviously you can buy at
[21:15] bottoms and tops and get a much higher
[21:17] percentage if you just put your money in
[21:19] the S&P 500 which is like an 8% return
[21:21] on average that's not even I mean that's
[21:24] not even keeping up with the the
[21:27] debasement of currency
[21:29] so you know the money supply since 2008
[21:32] has
[21:33] grown I think it's an average of 7 to 8%
[21:37] so that's that's the debasement right so
[21:40] you have to basically put your money
[21:42] somewhere that can give you a higher
[21:44] return than that but that's not
[21:45] considering other asset prices going
[21:47] higher either right that's an average so
[21:51] people have to understand there's some
[21:53] major debasement and you have to protect
[21:55] Capital but unfortunately you know only
[21:59] the top 10% of people are doing that
[22:01] like if you probably look up the
[22:03] numbers the top 10% probably own maybe
[22:07] 70% of all assets in the world maybe 80
[22:10] I don't know I mean we have to look
[22:12] bottom 50% dude what do they have
[22:15] dollars Euros the currency getting
[22:18] destroyed every every year so if we look
[22:21] again with this 8% debasement happening
[22:24] year-over-year 8 time 10 years is
[22:27] what 80% dude you're going to you're
[22:30] going to lose 80% of your purchasing
[22:33] power by year 10 if we start today yeah
[22:35] and and it's brutal uh it's something
[22:38] that a lot of people don't don't realize
[22:40] because it's a slow death in the in the
[22:42] bathroom uh it's the Frog analogy but I
[22:45] have I have a lot of Hope honestly
[22:46] because I think that frog anology where
[22:49] like it boils slowly to death when it
[22:51] gets hot and hotter it's actually not
[22:53] true there there are some people that
[22:54] that tested this and I was fascinated by
[22:56] it the Frog actually tries to out if if
[23:00] he can and I hope and that's what also
[23:03] like when I see an older couple or when
[23:05] I see people like asking okay like why
[23:08] is the Euro losing so much value um and
[23:12] yes they are trying really hard to get
[23:15] everyone to agree that 2% or 3% is
[23:18] really good which is not uh and then
[23:21] also there's Jeff poof thing of like uh
[23:23] we should not count of zero we should
[23:25] actually count the productivity in so
[23:27] even if actually had 2% inflation we
[23:30] would actually have like 8% inflation
[23:33] because we have to account for the
[23:35] productivity gains because we are
[23:37] getting better in everything all the
[23:39] time so uh that that that's things that
[23:41] people people are just not aware of of
[23:44] of that I mean I think people that
[23:45] listen to this like 95% probably are
[23:48] aware of this uh there are always like
[23:51] some some portion of the people that are
[23:53] completely new to the thing and maybe
[23:55] that's the first uh podcast or first few
[23:57] podcast uh but it it it's something that
[24:00] we have to get out there and we have to
[24:01] orange pill that's why I'm also really
[24:03] liking subtle Bitcoin signs so I I don't
[24:07] wear a shirt where it's like bit Bitcoin
[24:10] or like some Rebel thing I don't like it
[24:12] to to have like massive signs on there I
[24:15] just like have like a small Bitcoin sign
[24:17] here small Bitcoin sign here and I think
[24:20] that's uh that that's like the subtle
[24:22] defensive way to to Orange build your
[24:24] family and I I noticed that the closest
[24:27] the family member are uh the more
[24:30] Bitcoin they actually get and uh uh like
[24:33] the closest people like my mom dad
[24:35] sister uh some some of my Customs they
[24:38] all have Bitcoin now because they're
[24:40] close to me and I'm always talking about
[24:43] it at some point it makes sense yeah
[24:45] also girlfriend of course uh but yeah we
[24:47] we have to be in our family that digital
[24:50] Soldier uh that that that orange son in
[24:53] the family that is promoting Bitcoin and
[24:56] yeah I think you're doing a great job
[24:58] with the watches because this enables a
[25:00] lot uh yeah and so that that's I think
[25:03] where where we have to go yeah I mean it
[25:06] yeah unfortunately you know we have to
[25:08] take that role um but it's our duty man
[25:12] I mean who who else is going to do it
[25:14] because the government's not going to do
[25:15] it um schools are not going to do it so
[25:17] it has to come back to the individual
[25:19] you know basically a decentralized way
[25:22] of of spreading hope um and I you know
[25:25] thank God for Satoshi creating
[25:29] Bitcoin when he did because think about
[25:31] it as people start realizing the
[25:35] problem well what if there was no
[25:37] Bitcoin okay let's say all of us cyber
[25:40] Hornets out there that now have Bitcoin
[25:42] and we know it's the solution what if
[25:45] there wasn't Bitcoin what do you think
[25:46] would be happening well the only way is
[25:48] to try to stop the government like
[25:50] literally out on the streets protesting
[25:53] going crazy trying to stop them
[25:56] from printing money well that's not
[25:59] happening anymore we're not doing that
[26:00] we're we're doing a silent and not
[26:02] silent but peaceful protest by choosing
[26:05] an alternative which is Bitcoin think
[26:06] about that like we we probably would all
[26:09] be out in the streets just going crazy
[26:11] right now but we don't have to because
[26:13] we finally have something a a peaceful
[26:16] transition of wealth that is happening
[26:19] thanks to bitcoin did you hear the
[26:22] Satori is a time traveler um Theory I
[26:26] actually didn't know I I didn't hear
[26:27] that also heard it uh I think a week or
[26:30] two weeks ago the first time ever and I
[26:32] was like what I have a Bitcoin podcast a
[26:34] daily Bitcoin never heard that it's
[26:35] really a funny funny thing uh this the
[26:38] theory is that Satoshi is actually time
[26:40] traveler that saw all the bad thing that
[26:43] happened since we have Central Bank uh
[26:46] money and there was nothing against that
[26:49] and then they invented time traveling
[26:50] and then he came back 2008 to put the
[26:54] white paper here to fix the problem at
[26:56] the root core it's it's a funny
[26:59] uh but but I think that that highlights
[27:01] that that I just thought about when when
[27:02] you're talking about that because uh
[27:05] it's so good that we have Bitcoin it's
[27:07] almost like aliens watch us and they're
[27:09] like oh they need sound money they
[27:12] otherwise they will kill themselves yeah
[27:14] true I mean you know I mean there but
[27:17] think about it I mean there's there's
[27:18] been Wars created even almost during our
[27:22] lifetimes simply because we're trying to
[27:24] make sure the dollar continues to be the
[27:26] the reserve currency so you know now we
[27:29] have Bitcoin which is offering a I mean
[27:31] they can't even shut it down dude what
[27:33] are you going to do roll roll up with
[27:34] tanks to to the Bitcoin I mean it you
[27:38] can't shut down Bitcoin you can't you
[27:40] can't now you know back then if another
[27:43] country is trying to change the reserve
[27:45] currency or this or that well you fly
[27:46] f-16s and f-22s and bomb the [ __ ] out of
[27:49] them well you can't do that anymore with
[27:51] Bitcoin so that's why but see that's why
[27:54] and it it you know and and it goes back
[27:56] to a touch point I want to touch a point
[27:58] with uh AI because Bitcoin is a
[28:03] tool and when the governments and
[28:06] everyone realized [ __ ] we actually can't
[28:08] shut down Bitcoin like even if we wanted
[28:10] to we can't do that and people are going
[28:12] to use it all over the place because
[28:15] it's decentralized they don't need a
[28:16] bank account all they need is
[28:18] internet um well damn we all got to use
[28:21] that tool then I mean if if you can't
[28:23] shut it down forcefully eventually
[28:26] everyone has to adopt it and you're
[28:28] seeing that with countries you're seeing
[28:30] that with companies and you're seeing
[28:32] that with AI people are weird about AI
[28:35] okay people are weird the people are
[28:37] scared um but
[28:40] AI is so smart like it is probably like
[28:44] people need to wake up to this too so
[28:46] Bitcoin two things I I always try to get
[28:48] people to think about Bitcoin because
[28:50] that's digital money and it's going to
[28:53] be the system that we use to transfer
[28:55] wealth and then AI
[28:58] because it's going to be another tool
[29:00] you're not going to shut down ai ai is
[29:02] not going to be shut down you're you're
[29:04] already it's already out there and it's
[29:07] incredibly smart and it's actually going
[29:09] to make the cost of knowledge go to
[29:13] zero zero you're not going to have to
[29:16] pay a consultant $85 million or $85,000
[29:20] or $88,000 to get information a lawyer
[29:23] you might not even need that um even
[29:26] Health like everything is going down
[29:29] into AI because AI is exponentially
[29:33] smarter than us in every way let me just
[29:36] to prove it to you okay let me do this
[29:38] okay so check this out let's see if it
[29:43] works hey Jarvis are you there are you
[29:45] listening yes I'm listening what's on
[29:47] your mind okay uh can you give me the
[29:51] percentage average percentage increase
[29:55] in the M2 money supply
[29:58] going up in the US from 2008 to 2024 so
[30:04] what's the the annual percentage
[30:06] increase in the M2 money supply the
[30:08] average annual percentage increase in
[30:10] the M2 money supply in the US from 2008
[30:13] to 20124 is approximately
[30:17] 6.97% this reflects the general trend of
[30:19] currency debasement during this
[30:23] period okay um so what do you think
[30:26] people need to do to hold their Pur
[30:27] purching power with this currency
[30:29] debasement to maintain purchasing power
[30:31] in the face of ongoing currency
[30:33] debasement people typically need to
[30:35] invest in assets that appreciate faster
[30:38] than inflation here are a few strategies
[30:41] one invest in real estate property
[30:43] values tend to rise over time often
[30:46] outpacing inflation making hedge
[30:49] against two can I can I interrupt okay
[30:52] so what about Bitcoin uh what what has
[30:55] been the annualized average return in
[30:58] Bitcoin since no over the past five
[31:01] years the annualized average return for
[31:03] Bitcoin over the past five years 2018 to
[31:06] 2023 is approximately
[31:09] 190% okay this means that if you had
[31:11] invested in Bitcoin 5 years ago your
[31:14] investment would have grown by around
[31:15] 190% annually over that period despite
[31:19] bitcoin's well-known volatility it has
[31:22] delivered significant returns compared
[31:24] to more traditional asset classes like
[31:27] stocks and real real estate okay so
[31:28] there you go okay so I don't even dude I
[31:31] don't even use Google anymore like I use
[31:34] chat GPT that's all I use okay not only
[31:37] that it can form lists for me it can it
[31:40] can make uh emails from me it can make
[31:44] the the amount of productivity that it
[31:46] has created for me for all my businesses
[31:48] has been just almost exponential it's
[31:51] stupid but see it's going to people need
[31:54] to see it as a tool and use it as a tool
[31:56] before it starts taking your jobs and
[31:59] before it starts you know doing all of
[32:02] that because if you don't learn how to
[32:03] use a tool you will become the tool and
[32:06] so people need to wake up I mean AI is
[32:09] nuts I don't know how much you know
[32:11] about AI but it's like I mean blowing my
[32:13] mind I partnered up with coin vigilante
[32:17] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[32:20] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[32:23] look at that beauty I love it so much
[32:25] coin vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin
[32:28] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[32:31] way to go out there and show that you
[32:34] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[32:37] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[32:40] dropped a completely new and amazing
[32:43] Genesis edition of their watch
[32:45] collections you have the date of the
[32:48] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[32:51] and of course also the block height and
[32:54] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[32:57] level of detail they put in in this
[33:00] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[33:02] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[33:05] down in the descriptions I love those
[33:08] watches so so much if you watch or
[33:11] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[33:13] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[33:16] and now the most important step is to
[33:19] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[33:22] hardware wallet my personal
[33:23] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[33:25] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[33:28] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[33:30] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[33:33] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[33:37] with the code Robin at the checkout
[33:39] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[33:43] your bitbox and the next step is to
[33:45] really level up your sovereignty as an
[33:48] individual you have to have the most
[33:50] secure self- custody setup you have to
[33:53] secure your own devices you have to
[33:55] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:58] an inheritance plan and depending on
[34:01] where you live you even want to have a
[34:03] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[34:06] in case something goes really really
[34:08] wrong and through all those steps the
[34:10] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[34:13] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[34:15] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[34:19] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[34:22] how you can level up your sovereignty
[34:25] it's uh super interesting because first
[34:28] of all this very podcast that you're
[34:30] listening to and you on uh it would not
[34:33] be possible without a like I could I
[34:36] could just not do it without AI every
[34:39] single day I'm still alone like that
[34:42] like there's no cutter there's no editor
[34:44] there's nothing else it's just me uh and
[34:48] the fascinating thing is since I started
[34:51] this I consistently drop the hours I
[34:54] need for each episode for the Post
[34:56] production uh and for the description
[34:59] everything and I think and hopefully uh
[35:02] my audience gives me right here um the
[35:05] quality is increasing at the same time
[35:08] so I get so good now in aligning the
[35:11] different EI tools next to each other
[35:14] and then putting my human input just
[35:18] there at the right time in there that it
[35:20] where it's necessary and maybe I
[35:22] actually do an episode on like just like
[35:25] explaining how I do a podcast uh I don't
[35:28] know if it fits in a Bitcoin podcast
[35:29] because it's not a podcast about podcast
[35:31] it's a podcast about Bitcoin but uh I I
[35:34] spend so much time uh perfecting that uh
[35:38] St process and infrastructure around it
[35:42] and it's a lot of fun and I even want to
[35:44] make a podcast with AI where I just chat
[35:47] with ch gbd uh about Bitcoin I I I I
[35:51] will probably do that in in El Salvador
[35:54] when I'm down there I will just like put
[35:56] chvd there would put my camera on there
[35:59] with a nice background uh and we'll just
[36:01] like chat about Bitcoin and then after
[36:04] an hour I will see if if I upload it
[36:06] also if it's interesting enough I don't
[36:08] know if it's interesting uh or or if
[36:11] it's not interesting me chatting with
[36:12] CHD uh but AI is massive so it's it's
[36:17] it's uh I I begin to think that maybe I
[36:22] don't ever need to hire an editor
[36:25] honestly I I I think about that all the
[36:28] time like I need to I editor I need to
[36:31] do this and that but then I'm like I
[36:33] consistently drop the time that I need
[36:34] for it and uh yeah it gets better and
[36:37] better in it uh for example one small
[36:39] thing that I do with it the trailer uh I
[36:42] pick myself what things in there but AI
[36:45] gives me uh like 40 50 options from
[36:48] there and I use two different tools so
[36:51] I'm not uh relying on one tool and then
[36:54] afterwards I'm like oh that that is
[36:56] really good I just like need to uh look
[36:59] through like 40 different small Snippets
[37:02] that's like really like just two one two
[37:04] sentences and then I really get a crasp
[37:06] of the podcast and that's then the in
[37:09] the trailer and then I don't need to I
[37:12] don't know make marks while I speak with
[37:14] you or like listen to the whole thing
[37:16] again and find the trailer that's so
[37:19] cool just notice what you said it's like
[37:21] I don't think I'll ever need to hire a
[37:23] video editor right I mean and that's
[37:27] that's what people are going to run into
[37:30] in three years probably so once it
[37:34] actually goes mainstream and people
[37:35] learn how to use AI dude I mean and so
[37:39] it's you know you should actually I
[37:41] don't know how much you like R Paul um
[37:44] have you heard of him oh yeah yeah I I
[37:46] listened to him wait do you mean the
[37:50] wait I will yeah he's with real Vision
[37:54] yeah exactly I I I listened to a lot to
[37:56] him in the beginning
[37:58] uh now since a long time not I don't
[38:00] even know I love that guy he I know that
[38:03] he he can get a bad rep with [ __ ]
[38:06] coining and whatever this and that but
[38:08] um guy has just such an amazing macro
[38:12] view that's what I've always respected
[38:15] about him is like this dude can read the
[38:17] macro like a master and you know it goes
[38:21] back to to what's going on too with
[38:23] price so you know he he has at this
[38:26] point buying bit coin even right now
[38:29] like all you got to do is think about
[38:31] the macro like yeah okay I could have
[38:32] gotten it $5,000 cheaper or 10,000 but
[38:35] like we got to think bigger um and one
[38:38] of the things that he's been saying as
[38:40] well is a four-year business cycle in
[38:43] which right
[38:45] now we're reaching a point in that
[38:47] business cycle where it happens every
[38:48] four years um the money supply is going
[38:52] to start rapidly increasing they just
[38:54] now the FED now pivoted and instead of
[38:57] you know you know raising rates they
[38:58] stopped and now they're dropping and so
[39:00] they're going to be dropping
[39:01] continuously until the end of probably
[39:04] you know
[39:05] 2025 and that's going to increase the
[39:07] money supply like crazy liquidity is
[39:09] going to be up and if you actually watch
[39:12] Bitcoin the Bitcoin chart paired with
[39:14] the M2 money supply together Bitcoin
[39:18] follows money supply almost like a
[39:20] positive correlation it's crazy so right
[39:23] now money supply just up ticked and
[39:25] Bitcoin is slightly now trying trying to
[39:27] go up and it's going to par it's going
[39:29] to be almost uh identical so we're going
[39:34] to start seeing the price of Bitcoin
[39:37] this is my theory um go up and going
[39:41] into the end of
[39:44] 20204 um and it's also paired with the
[39:46] election so in 2020 in 2020 was the same
[39:49] same [ __ ] dude um it it's almost like
[39:52] the Cycles it's almost like having cycle
[39:55] paired with election cycle paired with
[39:57] with the business cycle it's all like
[40:01] about the same so we're going to have
[40:04] this window where the price is just
[40:06] going to be stupid um I my theory is
[40:09] we're probably going to get to
[40:10] 200,000 maybe more I don't know maybe a
[40:13] little bit less but somewhere around
[40:14] that range and
[40:16] then you know things are going to go
[40:18] crazy um I think we're going to see more
[40:20] announcements next year of countries and
[40:24] companies already accepting Bitcoin and
[40:28] using it as a reserve asset um and I've
[40:30] been hearing a lot about the word
[40:32] collateral lately I don't know about you
[40:34] but it's like everywhere now it's like
[40:36] all of a sudden this word just came came
[40:38] up so it'll be interesting um I haven't
[40:41] dug too deep into that but it makes
[40:42] sense when it becomes a reserve you know
[40:45] well you want to use it as collateral
[40:46] you want to borrow against it this and
[40:48] that you know Michael sailor is
[40:50] definitely talking a lot about that it's
[40:52] been interesting with the Michael sailor
[40:53] I've been watching how like you know
[40:55] people are kind of [ __ ] on him a
[40:57] little bit um but you know to each their
[41:00] own I mean that's that's the other thing
[41:01] man
[41:02] it's I don't know there we live in a
[41:05] world of options
[41:07] man like I I don't know what you want me
[41:09] I mean maybe you can put someone as a
[41:11] dictator for Bitcoin beliefs but it's
[41:14] like that's not the world we live in and
[41:16] we honestly don't want to all think the
[41:18] same because people always think like
[41:21] everything is a shitcoin everything is a
[41:24] [ __ ] whatever like dude okay fine you
[41:26] believe that that's fine I'm not going
[41:27] to [ __ ] on you for that but it's like I
[41:30] feel like sometimes we got to chill out
[41:31] a little
[41:32] bit like you know we're all we're all
[41:35] trying to to to achieve a better place a
[41:38] better world and you know why you know
[41:40] going back to this I was thinking about
[41:42] this you know why do you think a lot of
[41:45] people are going
[41:47] for shitcoins for other assets other
[41:50] than Bitcoin like what do you think I
[41:53] think there's a lot of components I
[41:55] think uh unit buas uh is actually a big
[41:58] one uh I think when people come into the
[42:00] app they like oh what that's like this
[42:03] Bitcoin because the on boarded with like
[42:05] those coin bases and the normal apps and
[42:07] then oh Bitcoin 60,000 Bitcoin cash
[42:10] under that then there's like ethereum
[42:12] under that and like it plays a lot of
[42:15] the roles uh then people really don't
[42:18] want to miss out on something and if
[42:21] they really want to look for the next
[42:23] Bitcoin they think that Bitcoin already
[42:24] ran to its uh maximum capacity and then
[42:27] they want to look to the next one that I
[42:29] think is an probably an impact of that
[42:33] uh and there are probably like 100 other
[42:34] reasons that I I I miss out here but
[42:38] what what are your thoughts yeah I mean
[42:39] I I think it all goes back to the risk
[42:41] curve um Bitcoin is always the first
[42:44] mover um it always is and people are
[42:48] placing their bets on security and
[42:52] safety so if you want once again it
[42:55] always it always goes back to this
[42:57] um you want to put your money somewhere
[42:59] where it's going to grow in value over
[43:00] time and Bitcoin is the safest bet for
[43:03] that now here's where I also sometimes
[43:06] disagree with some hardcore like Bitcoin
[43:09] Maxis is like Bitcoin only everything
[43:12] Bitcoin put it all into Bitcoin uh
[43:14] forget about your business sell it this
[43:16] and that put it all into Bitcoin I'm
[43:17] like okay okay okay I mean I I get it
[43:21] but it's not an income generating thing
[43:24] so a bit Bitcoin is not there to
[43:27] generate income it's there to store the
[43:30] value of the income that you put in okay
[43:33] so let's get that straight first I you
[43:36] need a job or you need you know cash
[43:39] flow to be able to you know add that to
[43:42] your Bitcoin stack so that's why I
[43:46] always tell people too like dude so many
[43:48] people out there like just put all their
[43:50] money into cryptos or Bitcoin and they
[43:53] just hope they're going to make it and
[43:54] then they stop working it's like this is
[43:56] my path for Financial Freedom like what
[43:59] the hell are you talking about like
[44:01] that's not your path for that's that's
[44:03] simply hope and wishful thinking you
[44:06] need to still create skills you need to
[44:08] still create and try to generate
[44:10] different streams of income to keep
[44:12] adding to the Bitcoin stack to actually
[44:14] create Financial Freedom right and so
[44:17] with the risk curve going back to that a
[44:20] lot of how psychology of money you
[44:23] should read psychology of money if you
[44:24] haven't yet um you know a lot of this
[44:27] pychology of money is well okay we
[44:29] missed out on bitcoin so now we got to
[44:32] start going down the risk curve into
[44:34] more risky Investments because we
[44:37] already Mi missed out on the upside of
[44:39] Bitcoin so now we got to start finding
[44:41] other assets that are hopefully going to
[44:43] outperform bitcoin um which it will
[44:46] happen there will be outperformance but
[44:48] then it's going to go back to the same
[44:49] thing all of those things that
[44:50] outperform Bitcoin are going to go down
[44:52] another 99% and it's all going to flow
[44:55] back into Bitcoin and over the long-term
[44:57] Bitcoin is going to outperform and then
[44:59] it's going to be the same cycle so
[45:00] people need to understand that so you
[45:03] know and I'll be honest dude like
[45:04] seriously um simply because I understand
[45:07] how those Cycles work my my at least
[45:11] from from my perspective is how do I
[45:14] accumulate more
[45:15] Bitcoin like that's the ultimate goal so
[45:18] I understand it's a reserve it's a store
[45:19] of value how do I accumulate more okay
[45:21] well I got businesses that generate cash
[45:23] that's how I accumulate um I could do a
[45:25] 9 to5 that's a way accumulate um I could
[45:29] also have for example my portfolio as an
[45:32] example let's say it's 70% 80% Bitcoin
[45:36] and then the other 20% is let's say
[45:39] Nvidia it's Tesla it's I'm spreading a
[45:42] little bit of my my risk even though I'm
[45:45] pretty much all in Bitcoin but I
[45:47] understand that some assets will
[45:49] outperform and go and generate a lot
[45:52] more return but again it's a smaller
[45:55] bucket it's not the other way around
[45:57] right I have most of my bucket in safety
[46:00] and and what I know will work for
[46:02] decades and decades but people think
[46:05] that way though um especially DG and
[46:08] especially the the the younger
[46:10] generation
[46:11] is dude our system our our economic and
[46:15] blame it on the economic system like
[46:17] that's what I say blame it on the system
[46:20] our system has you know destroyed us so
[46:23] hard that people can't afford homes
[46:26] anymore more people can't even afford to
[46:28] live that the only way out is to
[46:30] speculate it is like I mean am I wrong
[46:34] that you have you have to speculate in
[46:38] in just the dumbest [ __ ] just to
[46:40] hopefully make it because it's the only
[46:42] thing that's going to give you a higher
[46:43] percentage than you know our cost of
[46:46] living going higher so that's part of
[46:49] the reason I mean I'm not I'm not
[46:50] defending [ __ ] coinery or anything but
[46:52] I'm trying to at least explain that
[46:54] point of view where you know people
[46:56] always look for that Alpha that that
[46:58] higher return the only thing I have to
[47:00] say is fine do whatever you want I mean
[47:02] it's just trading I mean it's like I
[47:04] can't tell you you're a piece of [ __ ]
[47:05] because you're trying to to to get a a
[47:07] percentage return but at the end of the
[47:10] day store it safely and turn it into
[47:13] Bitcoin 100% And and there are a lot of
[47:16] things in there W there a lot to impact
[47:19] and first of all like the the thing that
[47:21] you said in the beginning the toxic
[47:22] Bitcoin mindset I changed my VI a lot on
[47:25] that like I was I was The Toxic Bitcoin
[47:28] Maxi one year ago I really was that
[47:31] completely on Twitter uh and I honestly
[47:35] turned uh a lot to I would say a free
[47:39] market maximal list right now um where
[47:41] I'm like okay I don't see a value in
[47:44] other altcoins like I don't see any
[47:46] value in in anything else than Bitcoin
[47:49] from an altcoin perspective uh so I have
[47:52] my money in Bitcoin I was invested
[47:55] heavily in Tesla right now now not uh
[47:57] maybe in the future I am again uh in in
[48:01] stocks because I really love picking
[48:02] stocks to be honest I I did that before
[48:05] Bitcoin and it was so fun I was watching
[48:07] it every day I knew I I knew more about
[48:11] Tesla than than most Tesla employees new
[48:14] I was watching every interview of every
[48:16] Tesla employee and of course of musk um
[48:20] so I was really a nerd uh and I probably
[48:23] will do that again at some point if
[48:25] Bitcoin is kind of not that exciting
[48:28] anymore uh but that probably takes at
[48:31] least like five years maybe 10 years I
[48:32] don't know uh and then what I also see a
[48:37] lot with bitcoiners um they have this
[48:41] toxic trade of they're putting their own
[48:44] values on the Bitcoin and think then
[48:47] every other Bitcoin has to think the
[48:49] same for example with diet the carnival
[48:53] diet we all know what major benefits uh
[48:57] uh meat and Carnival diet and beef has
[49:00] there also some disadvantages and to
[49:03] think that every bitcoiner has to eat
[49:05] only one beef steak a day and nothing
[49:08] else is just absolutely
[49:12] hilarious it's it's just not the the
[49:15] best way to to get Bitcoin to the masses
[49:18] because we might be successful in
[49:20] pushing Bitcoin to 8 billion people but
[49:23] we probably will not be uh successful
[49:26] with pushing uh steak to 8 people I
[49:30] don't that that's a harder that's a
[49:31] harder self yeah that's that's a harder
[49:33] stretch there um yeah it's kind of funny
[49:36] because you know I was taking my wife to
[49:39] a couple Bitcoin events one of them was
[49:42] Bitcoin day Miami so it's just you know
[49:44] I think breed love or you know just a
[49:46] bunch of people that are pretty high up
[49:48] there um were there and man dude she
[49:51] came out and she was like dude it's
[49:53] totally aocc cult and I'm like well
[49:55] that's not what I was trying to proof
[49:57] but I mean she understood cuz she was
[49:58] like wow like I actually like have never
[50:01] thought of how crazy it is like they're
[50:03] right about half the things but like in
[50:06] her mind and honestly probably a lot of
[50:08] people that I talk to they're like dude
[50:09] you're in such a cult like it's not even
[50:11] but see I feel like that's how it is
[50:14] usually like we are since we're the
[50:16] early adopters we take the burden on
[50:20] being the Geeks that are hardcore about
[50:22] this but it's because call it just call
[50:25] it this where we're the scientist who
[50:26] are first discovering this whole thing
[50:28] and of course we're and then we're going
[50:30] to bring it into real world applications
[50:33] where people don't have to be nerdy to
[50:36] understand it so think about it that I
[50:38] actually believe like this is my belief
[50:41] that most people will be using
[50:44] Bitcoin without even knowing they're
[50:45] using Bitcoin so they're they're not
[50:49] even going
[50:50] to understand what the hell's going on
[50:54] um and they don't need to I mean
[50:56] honestly they won't need to but um I
[50:59] don't think everyone's going to be like
[51:01] all of a sudden like figuring out how
[51:03] Bitcoin works and you know the read the
[51:05] Bitcoin standard they're not um it's be
[51:07] it's the same thing with the internet
[51:09] like dude I don't even know like there's
[51:10] a specific like software protocol that
[51:13] the that the internet runs on and you
[51:15] could think of that being the Bitcoin
[51:17] protocol that where money runs on but
[51:19] like I don't even know what it is like I
[51:21] know there's like a bip something I
[51:23] don't even know what it's called like I
[51:24] don't even know you see what I mean but
[51:26] I use the internet like crazy so I I
[51:30] don't know it's a theory I don't know if
[51:31] people in your podcast have mentioned
[51:34] like what it looks like from a worldwide
[51:37] adoption perspective but it is 100% that
[51:40] and uh I talked with Jeff poo around
[51:43] that um how Bitcoin adoption is and how
[51:46] scaling goes even with Michael saor
[51:47] talked about that topic and it is one
[51:50] 100% that there will be Bitcoin as the
[51:53] base layer just as the internet there's
[51:55] like this seven layer model of of of of
[51:58] computer technology where you go go back
[52:01] down really with the networking the
[52:03] really the hard layers and then there
[52:05] are somewhere on layer seven I think is
[52:07] the application layer I might be wrong I
[52:10] learned that in school but it's a long
[52:11] time ago uh and
[52:14] basically the same thing will be built
[52:17] with Bitcoin and there will be the
[52:19] Bitcoin main chain uh what people have
[52:21] to know uh only a few people will ever
[52:25] be able to to even transact on the base
[52:28] layer that we can now transact on the
[52:30] base layer is a massive privilege in
[52:33] like 50 years that that that's that only
[52:36] really big corporations and Banks and
[52:38] stuff like that will be able to do that
[52:40] huge transactions I mean huge money
[52:42] volum huge transactions yeah and then we
[52:45] will have the lightning we have fedt we
[52:47] have like thousands of applications on
[52:49] top of that e Bitcoin ETF that's a layer
[52:52] too that people don't think about we
[52:55] will have apps that that don't touch
[52:58] that uh you have no control over your
[53:01] Bitcoin but they will use Bitcoin on the
[53:03] back end so uh there will be
[53:05] centralization there will be
[53:06] decentralization there will there will
[53:08] be a lot happening uh on scaling Bitcoin
[53:12] but the important thing you always have
[53:14] the the option of going the most
[53:17] Sovereign route and that's what's
[53:19] changing the whole system what I think
[53:22] uh because people are oh then it's like
[53:23] gold and then it will be feat bu no no
[53:26] like gold you don't have the option you
[53:28] don't have this digital option of
[53:31] sending 10 EUR now digitally from
[53:36] Austria To America that option is not
[53:38] there with with gold I think that's a
[53:40] really huge difference so like go going
[53:44] into that you know because people are
[53:46] saying a lot of layers and things are
[53:47] going to be built on bitcoin and it's
[53:49] going to be virtually impossible for
[53:52] day-to-day transactions happening main
[53:54] chain and whatever I I don't know 5 10
[53:57] 15 years like I want to because again
[54:01] I'm not an expert um but I'm trying to
[54:04] understand from a macro perspective how
[54:06] that looks in terms of
[54:08] decentralization um because part of part
[54:11] of my again my passion my understanding
[54:15] for why this is the alternative to the
[54:18] current system is okay it's
[54:19] decentralized it's peerto peer at at
[54:22] that point is it even peer-to-peer if if
[54:26] I'm try like if we're trying to send
[54:27] money like through Bitcoin and it's it
[54:30] decentralized because I to me the more
[54:33] layers that you bring on it's is the
[54:35] more intermediaries that are
[54:37] happening you know being built on
[54:39] bitcoin that makes it less decentralized
[54:42] and less peer-to-peer
[54:43] right 100% the more layers you go above
[54:46] it uh the the less decentralized it is
[54:50] that's why people usually argue for an
[54:52] onion model I mean that's like you're
[54:54] getting the technical things here but
[54:56] there's like Bitcoin and there's like a
[54:58] bunch of layer toos around it and then
[55:00] there's maybe the lightning layer which
[55:03] is kind of connecting all the other
[55:04] layer tools uh and you have more uh
[55:08] decentralized Solutions where you have
[55:10] to pay more fee because the closer you
[55:12] are to sovereignty the closer you are to
[55:15] uh decentralization and security the
[55:18] more fees you will have to pay and the
[55:21] less fees you pay you uh offset that
[55:25] with giving up a little control
[55:27] like that that's how that's free market
[55:29] for you like the same thing if you want
[55:32] to transport gold you can go around with
[55:34] your gold bar uh bar in the middle of
[55:37] the street but if you want to be safe
[55:39] you better bring protection around you
[55:41] so the the gold gets not stole like you
[55:43] have to pay for Trans uh moving value
[55:46] like that's that's just how it is and
[55:48] for the everyday transaction like if I
[55:51] have uh50 uh dollars in in my hot wallet
[55:55] on a phone I don't care about security
[55:58] but if I have my life savings yeah in
[56:01] the world then I pay for security then I
[56:04] care about security that's that's how I
[56:06] I look at it I think I think this is
[56:08] where I can you know understand sailor's
[56:10] point of view of you know Bitcoin is the
[56:13] ultimate collateral and the reason why
[56:16] the dollar will continue to exist and it
[56:17] will is because we're not going to
[56:20] transact with Bitcoin I mean in his
[56:23] opinion is I think you borrow against
[56:25] that Bitcoin with us shitcoin and then
[56:29] you use that dollar to transact as your
[56:31] medium of exchange maybe but you know I
[56:34] I don't know it'll be interesting I mean
[56:36] it also for for capitalism to work you
[56:39] also need a a credit system as well and
[56:43] I I was thinking about it I was going on
[56:45] Reddit and just basically seeing what
[56:46] people are like talking about like what
[56:48] would happen in a Bitcoin
[56:50] standard that becomes a deflationary
[56:53] standard basically because right now
[56:55] we're in an inflationary standard like
[56:56] if you want to make it assets are the
[56:58] way but eventually as Bitcoin becomes a
[57:00] standard like if Bitcoin were ever to be
[57:03] legit the Bitcoin
[57:05] standard there's actually very little
[57:08] incentive to be taking out loans
[57:11] to go and you know create a new Venture
[57:15] um to even start a business
[57:18] because it you know it it's hard to to
[57:22] get a higher return than than the store
[57:24] value that currently exists like it's I
[57:26] don't know it's interesting like it's it
[57:28] almost decentivize you know credit but
[57:31] then you know it always I'm still trying
[57:33] to wrap my head around that and I'm
[57:35] trying to think okay well what what
[57:36] what's actually the world going to look
[57:38] like in a Bitcoin standard I don't know
[57:39] if you've covered it I'm sure you have
[57:41] you have about 290 podcast that you've
[57:43] done with hardcore Bitcoin or I've I've
[57:45] done someone I mean uh that's just a
[57:48] side Rod someone came up to me at the
[57:50] Bitcoin conference in Aban said like if
[57:52] you actually hold it up for 10 years you
[57:55] will be the most knowledgeable person in
[57:56] Bitcoin and I was like oh [ __ ] I never
[57:59] thought about
[58:00] that but but yeah I will I try to keep
[58:03] it up and and never thought about that
[58:05] aspect but yeah I I've just seen my
[58:07] knowledge grow so much in I I had no
[58:09] clue about Bitcoin 11 months ago but the
[58:12] thing that I wanted to uh ask you um
[58:14] because I think you already have a
[58:16] window in this Bitcoin standard because
[58:18] you already think more and more in
[58:21] Bitcoin you already get 20% of your
[58:23] sales in Bitcoin obviously you your
[58:24] company is not on a Bitcoin stand that
[58:27] 100% because it's probably you would
[58:29] probably not have a company if you
[58:31] really switch to bitcoin only because
[58:33] 80% of your sales all of the sudden uh
[58:35] go bust so um maybe from your experience
[58:40] uh of like seeing feat businesses seeing
[58:43] that before Bitcoin and now being more
[58:45] more Bitcoin standard what are the
[58:47] changes that you already can see in in
[58:49] your business and your uh strategies and
[58:51] maybe also your thinking as an
[58:53] entrepreneur is there anything that you
[58:55] observe that maybe gives an window into
[58:59] a Bitcoin standard yeah number one thing
[59:02] is being in a Bitcoin standard or at
[59:05] least adopting it is protecting us from
[59:08] the debasement of currency which I don't
[59:09] know why businesses are not already
[59:11] doing that and you know interestingly
[59:14] listening to podcasts from huge people
[59:17] I'm talking like people with hedge funds
[59:19] and you know they're asking how come
[59:22] other big
[59:23] companies have not been adop ing Bitcoin
[59:26] as a reserve you know just adding into
[59:29] the balance sheet and they're like it's
[59:30] actually like a popularity thing so they
[59:33] don't want to be the
[59:35] first
[59:36] to do it because they're basically going
[59:39] to get [ __ ] on like seriously no like
[59:43] it's it's that unpopular it would be one
[59:45] of the most unpopular things to do among
[59:47] their peers to where like the current
[59:51] system would not like it and they don't
[59:53] want to be the first yet um
[59:56] and it makes sense I mean when you're
[59:58] holding billions and billions and
[60:00] billions and billions of dollars in cash
[60:02] you know it makes sense to not but but
[60:04] the CFOs of those companies literally
[60:06] have told people I'm like because people
[60:08] are like well dude you have cash isn't
[60:10] that just constantly being like melted
[60:13] like an ice cube and they're like yeah
[60:16] but it's like it's just the way to play
[60:17] the game like we literally like they're
[60:19] like yeah but you know you're saving
[60:21] that cash to invest in bigger projects
[60:23] that are getting more expensive over
[60:24] time they're like yeah we know like
[60:26] they're not stupid you know they're not
[60:28] um they're just they're they're waiting
[60:31] for someone to make the move and ones
[60:33] that keeps happening it's going to be a
[60:34] ripple effect but right now it's it's
[60:36] still
[60:37] too too like scary for them to do it
[60:41] from a a a public relations perspective
[60:44] almost um but going back to to what I
[60:46] was saying well uh we're
[60:48] seeing you know our balance sheet
[60:51] basically grow increase in value um
[60:53] we're able to invest in our business by
[60:58] creating new lines of watches and by you
[61:01] know applying more marketing because we
[61:04] don't have cash that's melting away we
[61:06] have Bitcoin that's growing in value so
[61:09] it's a great business model dude I mean
[61:10] profits Prof you become a more
[61:13] profitable company right off the
[61:15] bat right off the bat um because it it
[61:18] just grows in value so I I'd rather be
[61:20] putting my money in in Bitcoin um and so
[61:23] to me it's it's it's amazing and going
[61:25] back back to what we were saying you
[61:26] know it's peer-to-peer right now and you
[61:28] know people are willing to spend the
[61:30] Bitcoin um to get a a good now we're
[61:33] running into some issues too though
[61:34] where
[61:36] especially you know maybe I would say
[61:38] the hardcore are like yeah I love your
[61:40] watches but I'd rather have my Bitcoin
[61:43] and I'm like okay I get
[61:45] it I mean look more power to you I don't
[61:49] it doesn't really matter to me but we're
[61:51] running into that issue sometimes but
[61:53] I'm like you know we we always people
[61:55] forget too that especially we we try to
[61:58] be super low time preference and low
[62:00] time preference is great you know you
[62:02] focus more on the future the current
[62:04] system makes us very selfish uh High
[62:07] Time preference we need stuff now I need
[62:09] to get my nice new car that I'm gonna
[62:11] pay for forever and I need to make sure
[62:13] I have blingy stuff all the time um
[62:17] but you know sometimes a low time
[62:20] preference clouds a little bit of what
[62:21] we're doing you know the world still
[62:23] needs to live it still needs to enjoy
[62:25] there's need for expression in
[62:28] humans what are you wearing right now a
[62:31] Bitcoin shirt I don't know right it has
[62:33] that Bitcoin logo you're expressing
[62:34] yourself those glasses I'm sure you
[62:36] picked those glasses right did yeah you
[62:38] want to express yourself in a way that
[62:40] you like to express yourself my hair I
[62:42] put it this way for a reason I like
[62:44] quarter sips for a reason I wear this
[62:46] watch for a reason right so people often
[62:48] forget that um and a lot of times like
[62:51] sometimes we even get [ __ ] dude like
[62:52] people like give us crap like you should
[62:54] only be putting in bit bit coin like why
[62:56] are you making this and I'm like just
[62:58] relax just relax again going back to
[63:00] like take a chill pill it's going to be
[63:02] okay free market like you said but uh
[63:05] Bitcoin standard has been positive for
[63:06] us and I highly recommend other people
[63:09] especially bigger companies start
[63:10] putting you know some of their reserves
[63:12] in Bitcoin you know in their balance
[63:13] sheet and we might see it from from
[63:16] Microsoft let's see did you hear that I
[63:18] heard that and then I heard also from
[63:22] another person that apple is in talks
[63:24] too have you heard about that
[63:26] uh no but it's uh it's public knowledge
[63:30] that Tim Cook has personally Bitcoin uh
[63:33] so that's a positive sign if the CEO
[63:35] publicly already acknowledged that he
[63:37] has Bitcoin because I think uh the big
[63:39] CEOs probably all have kind of Bitcoin
[63:42] or like some kind of exposure or like I
[63:45] don't know some weird Bitcoin friend
[63:47] already gifted them something or
[63:48] something like that but he publicly
[63:51] acknowledges that Bitcoin is a great uh
[63:53] investment and is one of the options to
[63:56] protect you there's an interviewer out
[63:58] with him so that's interesting and yeah
[64:01] Microsoft is super interesting uh
[64:03] because that could actually happen and
[64:05] it's a shareholder uh voting and guess
[64:08] who's the second biggest shareholder of
[64:10] Microsoft Black Rock uh guess how
[64:15] Microsoft would buy Bitcoin probably
[64:16] with the Bitcoin ETF with black rock so
[64:19] uh they have an incentive incentive to
[64:22] to Lobby a little bit of Microsoft that
[64:24] they buy their Bitcoin ETF so it's all
[64:27] really really interesting how those
[64:30] Bitcoin ETFs then also Drive the the
[64:33] company adoptions
[64:35] so it's just like so fun to watch like I
[64:38] I love I love what I do but see it's a
[64:41] popularity thing like I said it's it's a
[64:43] it's just like a high school click like
[64:46] you know everyone doesn't all jump in
[64:48] into the next hot thing you know what I
[64:50] mean like it it's one person and I'm
[64:52] like oh I like that guy like what's he
[64:53] wearing oh let me just start doing that
[64:55] then you do then the other person does
[64:56] it and I feel like that's what's
[64:57] happening and it it all goes back to
[64:59] reputation right you don't want to be
[65:01] the first one to go up in Flames after
[65:03] making a big move and so to me Black
[65:05] Rock was the first stepping stone once
[65:08] that becomes more familiarized with you
[65:11] know investment houses you know like
[65:14] families and and everything like that
[65:15] like dude it's only going to be a ripple
[65:18] effect it's a matter of time and I I
[65:20] think this consolidation that we've seen
[65:22] this this year is just setting us up for
[65:24] such a an an insane appreciation on
[65:27] price what's your like I don't even know
[65:29] if you've been asked this in your
[65:30] podcast but what's your what's your top
[65:32] prediction and bottom prediction for the
[65:35] next cycle like what's gonna be the
[65:36] bottom and top uh you mean bottom of uh
[65:42] from having to having uh cycle so from
[65:44] the last basically like yeah what was
[65:47] the bottom for last cycle it was
[65:49] 15 15K yeah I
[65:52] think this having bottom I think we
[65:54] already saw I think with like 30 40,000
[65:57] I don't think it's really hard for me to
[65:59] imagine that we actually dip below that
[66:01] it wouldn't need like a massive event
[66:04] like I don't know coinbase GH bu or
[66:06] something like that uh to to go there I
[66:08] I don't I never I don't think we will
[66:10] ever see uh the 20 30 40,000 range maybe
[66:14] 50,000 if something small happens I
[66:16] don't know uh but I don't I have a hard
[66:20] time thinking about that and the top um
[66:23] the most realistic cases are between 100
[66:25] 50 and 350k that that's kind of the
[66:28] realistic top but honestly everything is
[66:31] possible it's like I I wish we don't
[66:34] have a million Bitcoin for two reasons
[66:37] first of all it's uh too high I don't
[66:40] want to buy so so high I am young I want
[66:43] to buy low I would love to have Bitcoin
[66:45] lower and and not not higher uh and the
[66:48] second reason is what what what does it
[66:51] mean if Bitcoin goes to a million or two
[66:54] million or some crazy number like that
[66:57] in the next two years that means the
[66:59] field system cracks down massively and
[67:03] that that is a lot of pain in your
[67:05] families in your neighborhoods H with
[67:07] loved ones that don't have Bitcoin so I
[67:10] don't wish that for the world I I would
[67:12] love the fear system like just like
[67:15] slowly
[67:16] uh uh devalue yourself into the future
[67:21] into existence so uh that that's the the
[67:24] more likely but yeah my my guess is also
[67:28] as you said 200,000 I see it like around
[67:30] 150 to 350,000 it's obviously a big
[67:33] range uh if to have to put a number on
[67:36] there I would shoot for the 250,000 I
[67:38] love that number because it's a quarter
[67:39] million also I think that would be an
[67:41] amazing number to hit uh but yeah around
[67:44] that range I think uh we will end up um
[67:48] but with the Bitcoin price every it's
[67:50] everyone's guess uh and it's also so
[67:52] funny when I see people because I
[67:55] sometimes put the Bitcoin price as the
[67:57] thumbnail and people are like oh never
[67:59] reaches that I'm
[68:00] like you don't know I don't know I don't
[68:03] pretend to know but you also don't know
[68:05] you you don't know if Bitcoin is next
[68:07] year two million like you have no ways
[68:09] of knowing I don't wish that to happen
[68:10] but it could very happen yeah it could
[68:13] yeah it's it's funny seeing all these
[68:15] Traders on on Twitter and and all fight
[68:18] about that price I'm like yeah it's just
[68:20] that's that's you know but people people
[68:22] still get distracted I think too
[68:25] distract just focus on adding more to
[68:26] your stack I mean it it it it's that
[68:28] imperative in my opinion like it always
[68:31] goes back to protecting purchasing power
[68:32] to protecting your hard earned money
[68:35] that's part of the reason why we made
[68:36] these watches is going back to that
[68:38] actually I don't know if I answered my
[68:40] question right at the beginning
[68:42] it's I want something to remind me of
[68:46] the importance of my hard-earned
[68:49] money okay and and and that Bitcoin
[68:52] protects that because the US dollar does
[68:55] not it actually almost spits on my time
[68:59] and dude that it it it it goes in a deep
[69:01] level man like to me I I it infuriates
[69:04] me that the current system is eroding or
[69:07] purchasing power by about eight on
[69:09] average 8% on average every year and
[69:12] it's a hidden tax you know what what
[69:15] makes me the most mad is that it's my
[69:18] family members my friends who are
[69:21] experiencing this without even knowing
[69:23] and without even knowing why
[69:26] so that's why we have to keep pushing
[69:29] the adoption that's why you know these
[69:31] watches to me remind me of that like hey
[69:34] like this is bitcoin's protecting me
[69:36] through time um and it's a it's a peas
[69:39] that I wear like every day to remind
[69:41] myself of that and that's why 45 people
[69:43] 45 uh countries you know it's it's those
[69:46] watches are woring about 45 countries
[69:48] right now so because people believe in
[69:49] that movement people believe in that
[69:51] movement and they want to push that
[69:52] adoption and so you know every company
[69:55] out there every business person everyone
[69:57] who at least understands the issue we
[69:59] have to keep letting people know that
[70:01] it's that important because we don't
[70:03] want our our peers to become poor we
[70:05] don't want them to continue struggling
[70:08] um and it's going to be a crazy shift
[70:10] man I I think uh for those who do own
[70:13] Bitcoin even if it's 0.1 point.
[70:16] 2.3 like I think we're going to start
[70:21] becoming you know seeing a shift in the
[70:24] elite
[70:25] he who has the money makes the rules if
[70:28] it starts shifting in this direction to
[70:30] where Bitcoin does become the standard
[70:32] those who hold Bitcoin um which tend to
[70:35] be more I would say in my eyes more
[70:37] benevolent more you know loving more
[70:40] understanding about making a better
[70:43] world hopefully the world does become
[70:45] better um because we're going to have
[70:47] we're going to be the ones who have the
[70:49] wealth because Bitcoin that's where
[70:51] wealth is going to gravitate towards the
[70:52] hardest money um because you don't want
[70:55] to hold anything else you really don't I
[70:58] love that so much I love that so much
[71:00] really cool um for for before we come to
[71:02] the end I want to get a little bit also
[71:05] in in coin vigilante uh and ask some
[71:08] questions on that um where does the name
[71:12] and the brand vigilante and and uh come
[71:16] from where where where does that have
[71:18] this origin yeah it also goes back to
[71:21] creating something that you know has has
[71:23] a meaning so V Delante to me is is
[71:27] someone sometimes it can be seen as
[71:29] negative um but it it's someone who does
[71:31] not have to wait for the government or
[71:34] for a central authority to bring Justice
[71:37] to the table right because often times
[71:40] it's you know the individual that has to
[71:42] do that and we're doing it in regards to
[71:45] bitcoin so we have us who are the
[71:49] Vigilantes who are trying to you know
[71:52] bring Financial sovereignty and and
[71:55] wealth and and protection to individuals
[71:57] and people so that that's basically what
[72:00] it means and that's why the logo it's
[72:02] kind of like a futuristic hooded person
[72:05] that's pretty much what it tries to be
[72:07] and so ideally every person who wants it
[72:09] is a coin vigilante you know what I mean
[72:11] so that's a little bit of the meaning
[72:14] behind it I I love that a lot really
[72:16] cool uh last questions around that um as
[72:19] you also u a watch is is for me always
[72:24] more than just a device that shows you
[72:26] the time it's it's a piece of art it's
[72:27] something uh to to show off who you you
[72:31] you actually are like something that you
[72:33] wear because if it's just about the
[72:36] time there's a form there's a lot of lot
[72:38] of a lot of things how we can see the
[72:40] time um how do you think will Bitcoin
[72:44] impact uh culture art and and this
[72:47] creative Outlet uh and even like
[72:50] architecture and and and stuff like that
[72:53] that's a that's a great question I think
[72:56] it's going to go back to the low low
[72:57] time preference and this was actually
[72:59] discussed in the Bitcoin standard um
[73:01] back when we were in a gold standard and
[73:03] we were in you know beautiful eras I
[73:05] mean we you you were seeing architecture
[73:08] being built like never seen before
[73:10] beautiful amazing architecture art
[73:13] painted on walls and ceilings and you
[73:16] know it was things that took years and
[73:18] years and years you know there's
[73:19] actually projects that took decades
[73:22] even you know like the basically the guy
[73:25] starting that project would die off and
[73:27] it would be taken by someone else
[73:29] because the projects were that big and
[73:31] they were thinking about beauty Glory
[73:34] which always takes time and I think as
[73:37] more and more of that low time
[73:39] preference idea starts being ingrained
[73:42] into people they're going to understand
[73:44] that um you know because right now we're
[73:46] we're dude you you've seen it you've
[73:48] also seen the almost like the there's a
[73:52] a a correlation
[73:55] between our purchasing power being
[73:57] utterly
[73:59] destroyed and devalued and art in
[74:02] today's world being devalued like right
[74:05] now I could probably like put a bunch of
[74:06] paint on my hand just slap a wall and
[74:09] that could probably be in a museum and
[74:11] go for a million dollars okay like it's
[74:14] that crazy like the de even art is not
[74:17] appreciated because we don't have that
[74:19] appreciation anymore um it goes back to
[74:21] the watches too I mean like and I
[74:25] I I think it's going to be an
[74:26] interesting shift and I hope it does go
[74:28] in that direction but we're seeing it
[74:30] and that's why we're also trying to to
[74:32] do coin vigilante as one of the leading
[74:34] watch companies in the new system which
[74:37] is going to be the Bitcoin system so
[74:39] ideally and honestly like it it will be
[74:42] very interesting if we do move into a
[74:45] Bitcoin standard I'm interested to see
[74:46] where coin vigilante goes because
[74:49] everyone will know about Bitcoin and as
[74:52] a result of that we're going to get a
[74:54] lot of attention in that regard so to
[74:57] me I don't know it's exciting we'll see
[75:00] where it goes but you know and speaking
[75:02] of beauty you know that's part of the
[75:04] reason why a lot of our designs take
[75:06] forever to make um for example this
[75:09] watch right here and this it's the one
[75:10] that we're going to sell so we're we
[75:12] already are doing pre-orders for it this
[75:14] is the very first prototype that we made
[75:16] for the Genesis watch Genesis Edition um
[75:20] and interestingly I'll show you since
[75:22] since it was this will be kind of like a
[75:24] sneak peek and kind of like a behind the
[75:26] scenes that no one even knows we were
[75:29] actually going to yeah you probably
[75:31] can't see it but in the case back right
[75:34] over here you won't you can't see it but
[75:36] we actually had the the logo of the
[75:38] times so maybe you can pull it up when
[75:41] you do your edits or whatever but the
[75:42] times logo of the newspaper was going to
[75:45] be on there and it was going to be
[75:46] beautiful like you could actually see
[75:48] you could probably pull up the picture
[75:49] right now of the times uh Chancellor and
[75:52] brink of second bailout for banks uh um
[75:55] we were engraving that logo but then
[75:58] we're like wait a minute I think we're
[75:59] going to have some uh copyright issues
[76:02] there we can't do that I don't think um
[76:05] so we we scrapped that and now we only
[76:07] have the text which is the same font
[76:10] same everything that was on the the
[76:13] print okay so you you'll actually see it
[76:16] yeah so so it's actually a different one
[76:17] no look up just look up the
[76:20] times and then look up Chancellor on
[76:23] brink
[76:26] oh this one probably yeah do that and
[76:29] then yeah look it up on the
[76:33] images so right now it only has that
[76:36] like the the basically go
[76:39] to where's the picture here go yeah
[76:43] right there so we were actually going to
[76:44] have that specific logo incredibly
[76:46] detailed like to the to to the te but
[76:50] you know we decided to take it off due
[76:51] to you know compliance issues and
[76:53] whatever um but
[76:55] now people
[76:58] know yeah really cool I L that a lot uh
[77:02] I think the
[77:04] the the the level of detail is the one
[77:09] that I like the most like the the small
[77:11] things that you can even like take to
[77:13] Orange P people uh I like like the new
[77:16] watch a lot because there's like some uh
[77:19] with the Genesis Edition you can explain
[77:20] things so it it has a story to it it has
[77:23] something uh you can talk about in there
[77:26] so that that's that's really I'm really
[77:28] looking forward to to to get it oh by
[77:31] far I mean I mean literally every time
[77:33] someone asks about it I mean you're
[77:35] almost going to have to explain like the
[77:37] Genesis block like every time I mean
[77:40] seriously like oh yeah it's like coin
[77:42] vigilante watch is the Genesis well what
[77:44] the heck is the Genesis well you know
[77:46] and it actually has a the Genesis block
[77:48] hash engraved you know where the minute
[77:51] marks traditionally go so it's it's
[77:54] pretty unique I mean they're one of a
[77:55] kind each watch is numbered from 0000
[77:58] out of 121 and the craziest thing which
[78:02] you know was a great idea that we
[78:04] followed was every watch is going to
[78:06] have the block height right here
[78:09] engraved this one doesn't have it just a
[78:11] prototype engraved at the point in which
[78:15] that watch was finalized and completed
[78:17] so every every watch will have its own
[78:19] specific block height which is pretty
[78:21] unique so you'll literally have a watch
[78:23] that you're carrying everywhere and
[78:25] you're be able to see well this watch
[78:26] was completed a block 865,000 blah blah
[78:30] blah which tells you you know the
[78:31] Bitcoin timeline I think it's cool I
[78:33] love it uh and it's also the uh the
[78:37] piece number is also engraved right when
[78:39] I saw that yeah in the back I love that
[78:42] a lot really cool um yeah I'm really
[78:44] looking forward to that and I will show
[78:46] it off in in the in the mid roll ad one
[78:48] once I get it and obviously on my on my
[78:51] wrist uh really looking forward to that
[78:54] um now coming to the end routine of the
[78:56] podcast the time flew really by uh what
[78:59] the the question that every one of my
[79:01] guests gets what can we learn from you
[79:03] besides Bitcoin besides
[79:05] Bitcoin that's a tough question I would
[79:09] say you know throughout my
[79:12] lifetime something that has helped me
[79:15] immensely is always growing on my skills
[79:20] so we always have to start stop thinking
[79:23] about not just how to to how to get
[79:25] wealthy how to you know how to do this
[79:27] and that like it's to me it's always
[79:30] skills first and then results and
[79:34] achievements and goals
[79:38] later what happens if I hit a million
[79:40] dollars right now dude if I don't have a
[79:41] skill to have the discipline to know how
[79:44] to keep my my money it's over okay I
[79:47] have an amazing business idea but I have
[79:49] zero skills how are you GNA start that
[79:50] business well if I know I can do this
[79:52] but I don't know how to use AI to help
[79:55] me how to be incredibly
[79:57] productive no way to figure that out
[79:59] right so to me I think I used to place a
[80:02] lot of focus on like dude I just got a
[80:04] bank huge money placing you know a lot
[80:07] of value here and that but no ultimately
[80:10] what's helped me in the long run has
[80:11] been my skill set so I I learned that
[80:15] from tennis so I guess that's a thing
[80:17] that you didn't aside from from Bitcoin
[80:19] I was always a hardcore tennis player
[80:21] and you know tennis is a is a sport
[80:24] where
[80:25] you know you see results directly from
[80:28] the skills that you learn and how you
[80:29] perfect those skills and so I I always I
[80:32] love sports sports have taught me
[80:35] competitiveness how to be you how to
[80:37] compete it teaches you how to deal with
[80:39] getting kicked in the nuts and you know
[80:43] dealing with failure dealing with wins
[80:45] um I'm definitely going to put my kid in
[80:47] sports from the day that he can start
[80:49] swinging a
[80:51] racket yeah Sports is so important to
[80:54] learn so many interesting things um
[80:57] perfect then let's come to the end
[80:58] routine of the podcast where the
[80:59] previous guest is asking a question for
[81:01] the next guest without knowing who the
[81:02] next guest actually is um your question
[81:05] from the previous guest has actually to
[81:07] do something with vins uh what will be
[81:09] the biggest Tailwind for Bitcoin in the
[81:11] coming years Tailwind meaning like one
[81:14] of the issues that it runs into uh no
[81:16] the the opposite of that so like the the
[81:20] wind that uh kind of blows from behind
[81:23] the Bitcoin and uh
[81:25] makes the adoption fast of it at least I
[81:29] think that's the Tailwind I think this
[81:32] uh election is going to be very
[81:34] important there has been the US is
[81:37] leader in technology the US is leader in
[81:39] you know
[81:41] Innovation and so far and I'm not trying
[81:45] to get political but we've seen
[81:48] mention of Bitcoin coming out of Donald
[81:52] Trump's mouth hundreds of times he knows
[81:55] about it he actually has some policy
[81:57] that's going to be done towards it which
[81:59] is very
[82:00] favorable and then Camala Harris I don't
[82:02] think has said the word Bitcoin ever
[82:04] seriously um so I think this is going to
[82:07] play a major role uh depending on who
[82:09] wins bitcoin's still going to succeed no
[82:11] matter what um but it's going to be a
[82:14] catalyst is my in my opinion once we see
[82:18] um a huge company not not micro strategy
[82:22] but one of the top 10 companies in in
[82:24] the us actually like either they're
[82:27] having it as their Reserve or they're
[82:29] accepting directly as Bitcoin
[82:31] payment that's going to be that's going
[82:34] to be the big the big absolutely it's it
[82:36] will be a massive massive Catalyst um I
[82:40] think it's it's really interesting to
[82:44] will'll be watching the the the election
[82:46] even I as a European really look forward
[82:49] to the election in the in America
[82:51] because I think it has actual real world
[82:53] implications on bitcoin because there's
[82:55] a clear Bitcoin Administration there's a
[82:57] clear Administration that is that that
[83:01] probably will be hostile more hostile to
[83:03] bitcoin so it has even outside of the US
[83:06] implications this time around oh
[83:09] absolutely I but I just can't wait for
[83:11] the election to be over me too yeah it's
[83:14] please get it over with I'm done too
[83:16] much
[83:17] uncertainty yeah and outside of that
[83:21] also um I I I try to not talk too much
[83:26] about politics uh but this year it was
[83:30] really
[83:31] hard because of the elections it's
[83:34] impossible not to talk about it I mean
[83:35] it really isn't perfect but uh then
