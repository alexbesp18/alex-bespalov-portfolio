[00:00] yeah it is a bubble right now the
[00:01] interesting thing about Bitcoin is that
[00:02] if you have $2,000 of Bitcoin and you
[00:04] owe $1,000 at the end of the month what
[00:06] happens if Bitcoin drops more than
[00:09] 50% hello
[00:11] Danielle hi uh Robin nice to nice to be
[00:15] here thanks for inviting me on the
[00:16] podcast of course I saw I saw you on a
[00:19] and I was researching a little bit about
[00:21] you and I also stamped upon uh a podcast
[00:24] about you on buas tool bu tool podcast
[00:28] or something like that
[00:30] and there I heard that you are in
[00:32] Bitcoin since 2010 and I was like
[00:36] wow I want to talk with
[00:39] you um yeah yeah I know I I'd first
[00:41] heard about Bitcoin on a on a website
[00:44] that uh it talks about tech Innovation
[00:47] and that kind of thing it's usually
[00:48] pretty negative about it and they're
[00:50] like oh some Japanese guy made up fake
[00:52] money or something you know I thought
[00:54] okay that that's pretty interesting and
[00:57] um I because I I'd heard about you know
[00:59] I paid attention to different attempts
[01:01] to try to make uh digital money before
[01:04] and generally they failed and whatever
[01:07] and uh but still like you think well
[01:10] maybe someone will figure this out at
[01:12] some point so I thought that that's
[01:14] pretty interesting and again I I really
[01:17] didn't take it seriously for for quite
[01:19] some time after that and then you know
[01:21] years later I started meeting other
[01:24] actual bitcoiners in person and I was
[01:26] kind of amazed and I met people who were
[01:29] you know far more bullish than I was I
[01:33] just thought this is an interesting
[01:34] project and I met people that thought oh
[01:37] my God this is uh this is world changing
[01:40] so that that forced me to learn a lot
[01:42] more about the basics and you know how
[01:45] it worked and why it was working and how
[01:47] it was different and then that inspired
[01:49] me to try to teach other
[01:51] people what what time around was that
[01:53] where you got Bitcoin fundamentally like
[01:56] 2010 you discovered it I think you also
[01:58] started mining there
[02:01] I mean yeah I mind I mind you know I
[02:03] tried mining some some Bitcoin in in
[02:05] different forms um but you know also uh
[02:08] you know lost a lot of Bitcoin and gave
[02:10] Bitcoin away and there there were a lot
[02:13] of different mistakes that you know were
[02:15] easy to make in the early days um but it
[02:18] was uh it was yeah I'd say you know it
[02:21] was maybe like you know in the in the
[02:25] you know bare market after the mount Cox
[02:27] collapse that I started looking into
[02:30] what Bitcoin actually was and how it was
[02:33] important how it fit in with everything
[02:35] else with economics with technology and
[02:39] so on right because Bitcoin is there's a
[02:41] lot of different things so Bitcoin is
[02:44] also the thing that requires people to
[02:47] actually take their computer security
[02:50] seriously because you know the
[02:52] information is money itself and and
[02:55] that's kind of that's kind of the
[02:57] problem right when I've um I you know
[03:00] I've met people that uh was saying oh
[03:03] well you know it's fine if you're you
[03:05] know if you only store $50 worth of
[03:07] bitcoin in a way that's not that secure
[03:10] and because again right you can keep $50
[03:13] of say cash in your pocket you don't
[03:15] need a bank vault for that right you
[03:17] might want to carry that around the
[03:19] issue is that if the hackers can simply
[03:21] take everybody's $50 from their C cash
[03:25] in their pocket at the same time that is
[03:27] a lot of money right and then the system
[03:29] does work if it's trivial for them to do
[03:31] so so even for a small amount it forces
[03:35] everyone to start thinking yeah how can
[03:37] I actually make the computers and cell
[03:40] phones work for me how can I make them
[03:43] something that uh you know is is
[03:45] completely loyal and the way a dog is
[03:47] loyal to its
[03:49] owner and why uh did you adopt it
[03:53] Bitcoin in the first place and maybe in
[03:56] a comparison while you still holding on
[03:59] to bitcoin why you now into Bitcoin did
[04:02] the reason change or what did your um
[04:06] thought process over the years Chang
[04:08] it's quite a long time over like over 10
[04:12] years um well the thing is that Bitcoin
[04:17] itself has changed right it went from
[04:19] this you know experiment to see if it
[04:22] might work to a a project that was
[04:25] attracting a large number of really
[04:27] smart and interesting people who might
[04:29] not even be able to hire to work on your
[04:31] project at any price there are certain
[04:34] people that they're intrigued because
[04:36] it's an interesting puzzle or simply
[04:38] because they feel like they're actually
[04:40] making a difference if it'ss for their
[04:41] ideology um
[04:44] so uh and then it gets to the present
[04:46] point where you have all these large
[04:48] Financial financial institutions um you
[04:51] know Sovereign wealth funds countries
[04:53] that want to be involved it actually is
[04:56] getting closer to this kind of global
[04:59] standard
[05:00] right so in some ways the the risk
[05:02] return is better now in that um you know
[05:06] the probability of Bitcoin not existing
[05:08] in a few years is is much much lower
[05:11] than it was in the
[05:13] past yeah the risk drops with every year
[05:16] with like you can make an argument with
[05:18] every day Bitcoin went on and the
[05:20] protocol is still running the all the
[05:23] blocks mind I think we actually at the
[05:25] point where it's so so unlikely that
[05:28] that it crashes that we can basically
[05:32] have a really really good risk reward
[05:34] profile right now like it's it's such an
[05:37] no brainer to invest even a little bit
[05:40] like I'm all in like I'm still till 2020
[05:44] full on a Bitcoin standard I adopted it
[05:47] personally but uh even if you say like
[05:51] you you have to invest a little bit like
[05:54] like a small portion you you have to do
[05:56] at this point if you educated a little
[05:58] bit um what I was wondering how did
[06:02] Bitcoin the environment you said you on
[06:05] to you went on to inperson meetings on
[06:08] conferences how did the vibe of the the
[06:12] conferences changed I only know Bitcoin
[06:14] from 2020 on I went to conferences 2021
[06:18] on I imagine it was completely different
[06:21] 10 years before
[06:23] that yeah I I think it really has
[06:26] changed right and I feel like there are
[06:27] some people who were involved early on
[06:30] who still wish it was more like a
[06:32] private club of you know the the The
[06:35] Treehouse of just their friends as
[06:37] opposed to something that you you see on
[06:39] uh television and newspapers um and so
[06:42] on that that Wall Street wants its uh
[06:45] wants its piece um but yeah you
[06:49] definitely had more uh more
[06:51] eccentrics um more more people who are
[06:55] you know the that it fit into their
[06:57] ideological worldview right like the uh
[07:00] you know Austrian economists and
[07:02] Libertarians and so on and some of those
[07:05] people you know I don't know they simply
[07:07] left the space or they went crazy I
[07:09] don't know um but there's other people
[07:11] that are they're still there but then
[07:13] you know it gets diluted over time as
[07:15] more people come in for for different
[07:17] reasons people coming in as uh seeing it
[07:19] as an investment or um or just uh you
[07:23] know just something interesting that's
[07:25] cool to be a part of right it becomes
[07:27] part of the Zeitgeist right just like uh
[07:30] you know everyone's been talking about
[07:31] AI for the past year for example right
[07:34] so at a certain point in time Bitcoin
[07:37] becomes more mainstream cool and then
[07:40] people just want to want to be a part of
[07:42] it and see what's
[07:45] happening and how is it like I
[07:48] researched before the podcast uh Bitcoin
[07:51] was under one cent in
[07:53] 2010 and now it went up to almost 70k
[07:57] now we are like at 40K and how is that
[08:01] Journey for you personally when you see
[08:03] the price from early on I think like the
[08:06] first years you probably don't watch the
[08:08] price as closely um did you even watch
[08:11] the price closely at any time or is it
[08:14] just like one Bitcoin or one Bitcoin
[08:16] yeah I didn't even know there there was
[08:18] a price for a long time right and then
[08:20] it was looking at it later I'm like oh
[08:22] my God you know like if I had had known
[08:24] you know that I could have got so many
[08:26] Bitcoin or whatever and you know it's
[08:28] it's it's frustrating right but at the
[08:30] same time you know if you if you know
[08:32] anything that's going to happen in the
[08:34] future um you know there there's a lot
[08:36] of there's profit to be made there and
[08:38] that kind of thing um so so even though
[08:41] you know I missed out on some of some of
[08:44] that kind of thing um it's still it's
[08:47] still amazing to just see kind of how
[08:50] something unfolds right because with
[08:52] Bitcoin you have this this
[08:53] pre-programmed sequence that's happening
[08:55] till
[08:56] 2140 right this this having that's it's
[08:59] going to go on for over hundred years
[09:02] and um it's it's kind of amazing to see
[09:05] how that see how that plays out right
[09:08] how the space changes how Bitcoin
[09:10] evolves how people come in and go um
[09:13] what's being built and and what's that's
[09:15] going to look like because it's not at
[09:17] all we don't know what that's going to
[09:19] look like when the block reward goes to
[09:21] zero or almost zero right then the
[09:23] minors are only surviving on the
[09:25] transaction fees and what are the
[09:27] transaction fees going to look like
[09:29] we're going to find out right I can
[09:31] speculate and say oh well there's
[09:33] there's going to be a lot of transaction
[09:34] fees because maybe you know you have
[09:37] institutions transferring large amounts
[09:39] of Bitcoin they're happy to pay a high
[09:41] fee or because there's broad usage or
[09:44] because each fee is actually
[09:46] representing you know lightning Channel
[09:48] opening and closings that or rebalancing
[09:51] that are basically supporting tens of
[09:54] thousands of other smaller payments um
[09:56] but but we don't know maybe it doesn't
[09:58] look like that maybe blocks um at some
[10:00] point in the future aren't coming every
[10:02] 10 minutes on average they're a lot more
[10:04] irregular than that and uh we'll see
[10:06] what that looks like I mean like if you
[10:08] look at um block times in like 2009
[10:12] those were definitely not every 10
[10:13] minutes right because now um Bitcoin
[10:17] mining is pretty much a pretty much a
[10:19] business and uh and you can see okay
[10:22] this Miner is making this amount of
[10:24] money per day and if I overclock it or
[10:26] underclock it it's going to do this you
[10:29] know what's the what does the effect on
[10:31] the efficiency and the Heat and the
[10:32] longevity of the machines what's the
[10:34] depreciation of the machines but
[10:36] generally speaking in early days people
[10:38] were just mining because you know they
[10:41] wanted to participate they wanted to see
[10:42] what was going on um and they weren't
[10:44] thinking what does this do to my
[10:46] electric bill or uh that kind of thing
[10:48] or is this even profitable does it make
[10:50] sense um so you you had these you know
[10:54] crazy
[10:55] fluctuations uh and you can see that
[10:58] from the from the Gen genis block to the
[10:59] first block it was actually a um like
[11:02] six days
[11:04] Gap so not not 10 minutes right and uh
[11:08] you know you didn't have basically
[11:09] 10minute blocks on average for for
[11:13] months no crazy I I wasn't even there I
[11:16] wasn't even there for that though you
[11:18] know so that was just looking back and
[11:19] being like Oh my gosh that's uh that's
[11:21] really interesting um how that how that
[11:24] played out right and if people were you
[11:25] know relying on bitcoin for day-to-day
[11:28] payments at the time they would had
[11:31] trouble did you see as a risk that the
[11:34] block reward runs out at a certain uh
[11:37] time that uh they are relying on the
[11:39] transaction
[11:41] fees yeah I think you can make the case
[11:44] and uh you know some some serious
[11:46] bitcoiners have that if you knew
[11:48] everything you know now and you were
[11:50] doing it again from the beginning that
[11:52] maybe you would want the block reward to
[11:54] decrease more slowly so instead of you
[11:57] know it cuts in half every four years
[11:59] years it it cuts in half every you know
[12:01] whatever 10 years or something right um
[12:05] or you could or you can make the case
[12:07] maybe it just decreases but never goes
[12:09] to zero so maybe it gets cut in third by
[12:12] a third then cut by another third then
[12:13] cut by another third instead of being
[12:15] cut in half or or it goes down to a
[12:18] fixed a fixed amount right either in
[12:21] percentage terms or absolute terms or
[12:26] um or or perhaps uh you know just
[12:29] smoother right so even if it gets cut in
[12:31] half it doesn't suddenly drop so much
[12:33] right it the block uh reward gets a
[12:36] little bit smaller with every block or
[12:38] every difficulty adjustment for example
[12:41] um so but but
[12:44] wouldn't yeah because each of these each
[12:46] of these
[12:52] havingsex so so when you have that drop
[12:55] off in reward then there's a lot of
[12:58] minors who are now basically priced out
[13:01] all at once and um that's where an
[13:03] attacker could buy up those
[13:07] machines or just attack because the hash
[13:10] rate is down so you know if you had more
[13:13] um more smoothly decreasing block
[13:15] rewards that would make the network a
[13:16] little bit
[13:18] safer but yeah so there there is a
[13:20] concern right if if there's not enough
[13:23] um demand for Bitcoin then uh the
[13:26] Bitcoin blocks are going to be uneven or
[13:28] more vulnerable to attack but again I
[13:30] think in that scenario maybe then people
[13:31] aren't valuing Bitcoin that much so if
[13:34] something isn't that important is it and
[13:36] people don't value it is it that bad if
[13:38] it goes away at that point I don't think
[13:40] it's that bad but the issue is that
[13:42] there's a variability of the block
[13:43] reward right so if it goes from one
[13:46] block has a huge amount of fees in it
[13:48] and the other one has very little um
[13:50] that can create instability right that
[13:53] the block times could be less
[13:54] predictable uh miners might wait until
[13:57] there's valuable fees in the meol cool
[13:58] to actually turn their machines on
[14:02] um or or you just might see more miners
[14:05] trying to reorg other miners they're
[14:07] they're not going to build on each
[14:08] other's blocks you know they see a
[14:10] lucrative block and they want to try to
[14:12] grab it for themselves instead of
[14:14] building on top of
[14:15] it are you surprised that the hash rate
[14:18] still keeps on Rising even though we're
[14:21] not at an alltime high like when you
[14:23] watch the price correlation with the
[14:26] Bitcoin mining correlation you would
[14:29] think there's some correlation but at
[14:31] some point this broke uh and are you
[14:34] surprised about that or was a thought on
[14:37] that well it still continues to surprise
[14:40] me even though it's not new so um if a
[14:43] lot of people again all the data is
[14:45] there go back and look at the price of
[14:48] Bitcoin during
[14:50] 2014 um at the start of 2014 Bitcoin was
[14:53] around $1,000 right and by the end it
[14:56] was
[14:57] $300 so you think hm the uh the price
[15:01] went down 70% what happened to the hash
[15:03] rate during that
[15:05] period right I don't know if you know or
[15:07] if if you had to guess what do you think
[15:09] happened to Hash Ray during the year of
[15:12] 2014 I guess it went down a lot right
[15:16] that would that would make sense but
[15:17] actually what happened was it went up
[15:20] and not just a little bit it went up 30
[15:22] 30X so the hash rate was 30 Times Higher
[15:25] by the end of 2014 than at the beginning
[15:29] which means that right if you were if
[15:31] you were trying to mine Bitcoin during
[15:33] 2014 pretty much all the Bitcoin you
[15:35] were going to get from it was in the
[15:36] first couple
[15:39] weeks you know so and then at that point
[15:42] what are you what are you even doing
[15:43] right
[15:45] um so it's not like that now where
[15:48] people are still running um as6 from
[15:51] five years
[15:53] ago um even though the hash rate is up
[15:56] uh people find cheaper sources of
[15:58] electricity they find ways to utilize
[16:00] the waste heat um they people mining I
[16:04] don't know I don't know what they're I
[16:05] don't know what they're doing um but it
[16:07] does seem like there's a number of
[16:09] different miners around the world that
[16:11] have very low operating costs and um
[16:14] they're they're scaling up right or they
[16:16] or some people are more comfortable with
[16:18] that idea maybe it's easier for the
[16:21] capital to put their money into what
[16:23] they see as a business right as opposed
[16:25] to a commodity so for say traditional
[16:28] investor they might think oh yeah of
[16:30] course I'll put my money into a company
[16:32] that mines gold but I would never just
[16:34] buy a bunch of gold bricks and then hope
[16:36] that they're more valuable in the
[16:38] future even though the mining businesses
[16:41] are very much correlated with the price
[16:43] of Bitcoin and what would make sense is
[16:46] if more of the mining businesses would
[16:47] actually hedge their exposure to bitcoin
[16:50] so that that you know you could look at
[16:53] how well the businesses run as opposed
[16:56] to saying hm well this this Bitcoin
[16:59] minor will become more valuable simply
[17:00] because Bitcoin will become more
[17:05] valuable uh it's great um when we take a
[17:10] step back uh and maybe focus on the
[17:12] first moment when you were frustrated
[17:15] about the price and you did not uh buy
[17:18] more earlier on when was that I imagine
[17:21] it was quite early for you and maybe uh
[17:25] what learnings can you give people now
[17:28] that when maybe into the alltime high in
[17:30] 2021 or they went in now and they feel
[17:33] like they understand Bitcoin and it's
[17:36] it's good but they missed a little bit
[17:38] of the bus well yeah that's a yeah
[17:41] that's a great question um
[17:43] so so yeah there's there times when I I
[17:47] told people about Bitcoin and they said
[17:50] oh well it's a bubble and I said well
[17:53] yeah yeah it is a bubble right now right
[17:56] but the fact that it's a bubble doesn't
[17:58] mean that it's worth zero the fact that
[18:00] it's bubble maybe means you shouldn't go
[18:02] all in with all your money at that exact
[18:04] moment right um but the the interesting
[18:07] thing about Bitcoin is that if you
[18:09] actually started dollar cost averaging
[18:11] at the at the peak of any of these
[18:12] bubbles you you actually got in at a
[18:15] pretty reasonable point right whereas if
[18:17] you went all in at the peak of the
[18:19] bubble then you would uh either be
[18:21] forced out at a loss or you would be
[18:24] very unhappy for several years and be
[18:27] frustrated um
[18:29] so we've had these series of bubbles
[18:31] right there was a bubble uh in 2011
[18:34] where Bitcoin went from a dollar to $30
[18:36] down to $2 there was a bubble in
[18:40] 2013 where Bitcoin went from um you know
[18:45] basically $10 to 250 down to 50 up to
[18:49] 1,200 and then down to
[18:52] 150 um and then almost a double bubble
[18:56] right depending on how you want to look
[18:57] at it then in 2017 right Bitcoin went
[18:59] from around a little under $1,000 to
[19:02] $20,000 and then later went down to$
[19:05] 3150 um and then 2021 we had maybe a
[19:08] double or single bubble however you want
[19:10] to see it where Bitcoin ran from that
[19:12] you know that low of 3150 eventually up
[19:15] to you know 69,000 and then down to a
[19:18] low of about
[19:20] 15,500
[19:21] so right um now there there's been these
[19:25] fads right whether it's like beanie
[19:27] babies or whatever Dutch tulips and this
[19:30] kind of thing where there's one just
[19:32] bubble prices run up and then crash and
[19:35] then that's the end of it but then you
[19:37] have enduring asset classes like real
[19:39] estate or the stock market in general um
[19:43] or or Commodities where you do see a
[19:46] bubble a crash and then later you you
[19:48] can get another bubble right sometimes a
[19:51] sometimes a larger one um and it's it's
[19:54] because that the price is not a direct
[19:57] relation you know directly reflecting
[19:59] the level of adoption it can be ahead of
[20:01] it it can be behind it so that's that's
[20:05] the number I really want to look at
[20:06] right how many Hardware wallets have
[20:08] been sold how many bitcoiners are there
[20:11] how many people how many actual people
[20:13] out there have $10 of Bitcoin right or
[20:16] $1,000 of Bitcoin um those are the
[20:19] interesting numbers right how many
[20:20] people are using Bitcoin every day you
[20:21] said you're on a Bitcoin standard right
[20:23] how many people is that um those numbers
[20:25] are harder to find so people sometimes
[20:27] look at the numbers that are easier to
[20:29] find such as okay what's the current
[20:31] price well the current price reflects
[20:33] some of that adoption but it also
[20:34] reflects very heavily the the
[20:37] speculators right people who just borrow
[20:39] money or you know leveraging into it or
[20:42] have no idea what it is they're buying
[20:43] it and they hope they can sell it for
[20:45] more dollars so they put this many
[20:47] dollars in and they're hoping to get
[20:48] more dollars out and again that's fine
[20:51] if they want to do that but they are
[20:52] kind of missing the point right um a lot
[20:56] of things can make you more dollars
[20:58] right betting on any other any other
[21:00] stock or tradeable entity um the issue
[21:04] is that when the price is going up then
[21:05] that attracts more
[21:07] speculators so then they buy in then the
[21:09] price goes up faster up until the point
[21:11] where it just gets a bit ridiculous and
[21:13] then people sell and then it starts the
[21:15] cascading liquidations on the way down
[21:18] so those kind of people that fomo in and
[21:21] then fomo out right they they they rush
[21:24] in too quickly and then they get forced
[21:25] out um they're really just adding the
[21:28] volatility and the chaos um whether
[21:31] they're helping adoption or not I'm I'm
[21:32] not really sure maybe maybe the
[21:35] volatility keeps away some people like
[21:37] it would be nice if Bitcoin kind of went
[21:39] up steadily um with adoption but it it's
[21:42] not possible right because if anything
[21:45] is um accumulating value noticeably
[21:48] faster than other things then people are
[21:50] going to all want to pile into it right
[21:52] now you know Bitcoin can't just go up
[21:55] 20% a year for for years or on after
[21:59] years so um the speculation is
[22:03] unavoidable unavoidable part of it
[22:06] basically um so we might be you know now
[22:09] you say okay well what's the current
[22:10] price and how is that relative to the
[22:12] number of people using it um we could
[22:15] potentially be ahead of the number of
[22:16] people using it now but behind the
[22:20] number of people that will be using it
[22:21] in five
[22:24] years I love the metrics that you
[22:27] brought up how how many cold wallets
[22:29] have been sold that's I never heard that
[22:33] but I would love to have a daily metric
[22:36] on that yeah and again you know who
[22:38] knows this the hardware wallet
[22:40] manufacturers and you know who's not
[22:41] giving those numbers out Harware wallet
[22:43] manufacturers I don't know why because
[22:45] that would be you know very inspiring
[22:47] for I think the community to have a
[22:49] serious uh look at what's going on here
[22:51] the only time we actually got any
[22:53] information about that was when the
[22:55] Ledger customer database was leaked
[23:00] yeah and this would also be an metric
[23:04] that would not fluctuate so much as the
[23:06] price would I guess of course when
[23:09] there's a price run up from 10,000 to
[23:13] 70,000 of course there are more Hardware
[23:15] wallet Sals but it would not fluctuate
[23:18] that much as the price would do you see
[23:20] the number go up technology the the
[23:23] brazy volatility you see in the Bitcoin
[23:25] Market as a as a positive can it drive
[23:29] adoption you touched on a little bit
[23:31] Yeah because there are certainly people
[23:33] who who come in for the the trading
[23:35] right there's people who are interested
[23:37] in that that that makes the headlines
[23:38] and then maybe not everybody but some
[23:41] percentage of them maybe it's only 10%
[23:43] maybe it's 30% right but they they might
[23:45] stay and say hey there might be more to
[23:47] this than just a number that's that's
[23:49] bouncing around um so that can help
[23:52] drive that adoption right and also the
[23:54] same thing in terms of um companies that
[23:56] are building the space they have to
[23:58] actually get funding they have to get
[24:00] attention so there needs to be a certain
[24:02] level of excitement for for that to
[24:04] happen people need to think that there
[24:06] is a potential of higher returns there
[24:08] than something else so the so I can see
[24:11] that case
[24:14] too yeah I see it now a lot uh with the
[24:18] upcoming spot ETF uh people are saying
[24:21] no when the spotf comes in few weeks
[24:24] we're hitting millions and stuff like
[24:26] that like this
[24:28] I think it's U maybe stupid um but it
[24:33] also drives a lot of attention and
[24:36] attention is where adoption is because
[24:39] when more people see it more people are
[24:40] getting educated on it and um but also
[24:45] maybe are people are getting frustrated
[24:46] about it and staying away from it like
[24:48] it's it's hard to measure it but in it's
[24:51] it's definitely fun to
[24:53] watch right right it's entertaining but
[24:56] yeah it is I I don't like it when people
[24:57] people make ridiculous price predictions
[24:59] right we've seen whatever John McAfee or
[25:02] or bellagi or or other people uh most
[25:05] recently Samson Samson Mo I believe um
[25:07] you know say oh million dollars this
[25:09] kind of thing um that I don't think
[25:11] that's helpful I mean yeah it gets it
[25:13] gets attention it maybe gets people
[25:14] excited but it also makes people think
[25:16] this is some kind of get-rich quick
[25:17] scheme or something and then you know
[25:19] someone else comes along and they they
[25:21] start promoting one coin or something
[25:23] else and they say oh yeah yeah just give
[25:25] me your money and you're G to be really
[25:27] rich and that unfortunately we see this
[25:29] again and again they run off of people's
[25:31] money or mismanage it or don't deliver
[25:34] and for someone who doesn't know that
[25:36] much about Bitcoin it's hard for them to
[25:38] distinguish between those two
[25:40] things did you state in Bitcoin only did
[25:44] you experience with
[25:47] altcoins um yeah I mean I've you know
[25:49] I've spent plenty of time reading
[25:51] different white papers and learning
[25:54] about different things and um
[25:58] but generally speaking uh you know any
[26:00] any all coin that I thought let me buy a
[26:04] little bit of this or something that
[26:05] that was a mistake you know the uh even
[26:09] if something actually does have an
[26:10] interesting idea then sometimes it's an
[26:12] interesting idea but it's a bad idea or
[26:14] it's an interesting idea but then 20
[26:16] other people can copy it and then the
[26:19] the value is just continually diluted
[26:21] you know it doesn't actually capture
[26:23] that value um so uh and then you know
[26:27] there's there's weirdly value in uh
[26:31] someone testing something just to show
[26:32] you what doesn't work right so there
[26:35] were some there was a coin a long time
[26:38] ago called fry coin and they thought oh
[26:41] well you know the the problem with
[26:43] Bitcoin is if it increases in value you
[26:45] know then people won't spend it so you
[26:47] know we should we should make a coin
[26:49] that incentivizes people to spend it
[26:51] because it's just decaying in their
[26:52] hands you know and then if everyone
[26:54] spends it it's just going to take over
[26:56] and it turns out okay yeah yeah you've
[26:57] created something that everyone wants to
[26:59] spend but nobody actually wants to
[27:01] receive
[27:02] it so if if you created something that
[27:04] everyone wants to get rid of then it's
[27:06] it's about as valuable as uh well
[27:08] garbage right and then the value quickly
[27:10] goes to zero and people forget about
[27:12] that but I think there was there was a
[27:14] valuable lesson there right
[27:17] um the same the same thing where people
[27:19] tried other experiments like using uh
[27:22] you know changing the proof of work to
[27:24] something else right so for example with
[27:26] Litecoin um they created that in 2011
[27:29] Charlie Lee specifically um with with
[27:33] the idea of oh well you know the if you
[27:35] know you know Bitcoin mining is starting
[27:37] to become too difficult for regular
[27:40] people you know let's make it let's make
[27:42] it something that uh they can't they
[27:43] can't build an Asic for let's you know
[27:46] make it uh you know faster and whatever
[27:50] right these are the selling points and
[27:52] uh the problem was they realized no you
[27:54] you can build as6 for it right because
[27:57] an AS
[27:58] is literally a chip designed to do one
[28:00] thing specifically very
[28:02] well and uh something that does think
[28:05] specifically will always outperform
[28:07] something that does everything in
[28:08] general it's just a matter of whether
[28:10] it's actually worth it for someone to to
[28:13] bother to do that um so those those
[28:16] selling points you know started started
[28:18] going away um the same thing with uh
[28:22] with Litecoin saying oh we're faster
[28:25] well they're not faster right they just
[28:27] made a shorter block time and it's
[28:29] pretty easy to take someone else's code
[28:31] and change a single number change a
[28:33] parameter so Bitcoin has a block block
[28:36] time Target of 10 minutes Litecoin has a
[28:38] block time Target of 2.5 minutes but the
[28:42] issue though is that those Litecoin
[28:44] blocks don't have the same security as
[28:47] Bitcoin blocks so there there's actually
[28:49] a website um which which shows that
[28:52] where shows you know hey may you maybe
[28:54] for every one Bitcoin confirmation you
[28:57] you would need like 60 Litecoin
[28:59] confirmations or something right because
[29:01] the chain simply isn't as secure there's
[29:03] not as much work accumulated um but then
[29:06] there's something else which is that two
[29:09] and a half minutes is still way too slow
[29:11] if you're waiting for confirmation if
[29:13] you're actually trying to buy uh you
[29:15] know a cup of coffee for example right
[29:17] and that's two and a half minutes on
[29:19] average and um sometimes it can be a lot
[29:21] more than that right because block time
[29:24] bitcoin's block time Target is 10
[29:25] minutes but recently we saw gap of an
[29:28] hour 42 between two blocks and this is
[29:31] under conditions where the hash rate is
[29:33] doing very well and actually Rising
[29:36] so so you see that you know for those
[29:39] kind of payments you do want something
[29:40] like the lightning Network where you you
[29:43] know have a confirmation within seconds
[29:45] essentially that the payment is uh
[29:48] complete so you know there were a lot of
[29:50] interesting experiments But ultimately
[29:52] the you know most of them are um dead
[29:55] ends or some you know maybe something
[29:57] you might want to think about
[29:58] integrating into Bitcoin at some point
[30:00] or or something else
[30:04] entirely so in your opinion the altcoins
[30:07] have no value and they will go all to
[30:10] zero no no I'm I'm not saying that
[30:12] because I can't I can't say things that
[30:14] are you know I I don't want to say
[30:16] anything that I haven't studied
[30:17] carefully is worthless and of course you
[30:20] know there's always going to be new
[30:21] things that I don't understand right so
[30:23] like for example I don't
[30:26] necessarily understand you know virtual
[30:29] reality worlds or you know nft artwork
[30:33] right so so those might have value to
[30:36] somebody else right there are video
[30:38] games like uh where people what was it
[30:41] counterparty where people are paying for
[30:42] party hats um and they're not real right
[30:45] they're paying for virtual hats but
[30:48] apparently that has value to them right
[30:50] and that's not something that just went
[30:51] away you might think that's a crazy fat
[30:53] but then people still want it the same
[30:56] thing with uh fancy watch
[30:57] you know look look look at my watch
[30:59] right um there's just people I know that
[31:02] are um you know they'll they'll pay tens
[31:05] of thousands of dollars for a watch and
[31:07] it keeps time less accurately than their
[31:10] phone and it's also very heavy and it
[31:12] requires being wound and it's not really
[31:15] really clear why why that uh is valuable
[31:18] to me so I don't want to I'm not going
[31:20] to run around and say oh yeah those are
[31:21] all going to be worthless uh soon
[31:25] because it's a market that I I don't
[31:27] understand understand right so it could
[31:28] be older than me it could be you know
[31:30] developed later than me and it's too new
[31:33] um that's the way it is right so but I
[31:34] have looked through certain altcoins in
[31:36] a lot of detail and it can tell you
[31:38] what's wrong with those specifically
[31:40] right um there are alt coins like uh
[31:42] Ripple where the consensus mechanism
[31:45] really just doesn't
[31:47] work um it doesn't make sense right
[31:50] there's uh there are stable coin white
[31:52] papers that I read that like yeah this
[31:54] is not going to work right and one of
[31:55] them that I read I knew it wasn't going
[31:56] to work they didn't even launch it and
[31:59] then there are other ones where you know
[32:00] the the whole thing just blew up under
[32:02] the conditions that I saw oh yeah that's
[32:04] not going to work right this works in
[32:06] these conditions but in those conditions
[32:08] it fails and that's all
[32:11] um but the Ripple consensus isn't even
[32:13] the worst thing about it right the worst
[32:14] thing about it is they actually don't
[32:16] have nobody has complete history of the
[32:20] uh the block the Ripple blockchain they
[32:22] claim to have lost lost
[32:25] it I don't know how you could possibly
[32:27] lose a
[32:28] blockchain um it's very strange so
[32:31] they're like oh yeah the first like
[32:32] 32,000 blocks we don't know we don't
[32:34] know where they are so we just count
[32:38] like block 32,000 as the the Genesis
[32:40] block but it's
[32:43] not and when you look at um other
[32:48] allcoin uh I will call it US dollar or
[32:51] the Fiat system in
[32:52] general um where we have a lot of
[32:56] history like years of the US dollar or
[32:58] even longer if you go past
[33:00] 19971 where are you seeing this going
[33:03] there are a lot of bitcoiners that's
[33:04] saying it will go away we have now a new
[33:07] money monetary system there are some
[33:09] saying no it will stick around for a
[33:11] long long while do you have any
[33:13] predictions or any um thoughts on the
[33:16] field
[33:18] system well yeah so so I I happen to
[33:21] like the US dollar um especially because
[33:23] I have traveled to places where their
[33:25] local currency is is not that good right
[33:29] it hardly holds any value um it's kind
[33:32] of absurd the largest denomination you
[33:35] you can't even buy a cup of coffee
[33:37] with um so the the dollar historically
[33:40] has been one of the more responsible
[33:43] responsibly managed V currencies um
[33:46] maybe like the closest competitor to it
[33:47] is the Swiss frank um
[33:52] and uh when I when I you know talked to
[33:55] people years ago who were saying oh the
[33:57] dollar is going to collapse it's going
[33:58] to disappear I thought no no you're
[34:01] crazy right not not any time in the next
[34:02] 50 years certainly um but then uh then
[34:06] in 2020 right something changed um
[34:10] the the people that are in charge of the
[34:12] US dollar became a lot less responsible
[34:14] with US Dollars and they also shut down
[34:17] the US economy I thought well that's
[34:20] actually the one possible condition that
[34:22] could that could really damage the
[34:24] dollar standing right um massively
[34:27] increasing the supply and uh decreasing
[34:30] the you know amount of goods and
[34:32] services you can actually buy with that
[34:34] dollar so so I am a lot more concerned
[34:37] now um especially when you consider the
[34:40] just the total amount of debt the
[34:42] interest on the debt the fact that there
[34:44] isn't any uh there isn't anyone that's
[34:47] really serious about trying to get the
[34:50] fiscal house in order um to put the
[34:52] dollar back on the right track however
[34:55] right the dollar has been so dominant
[34:56] for so long um that even under
[35:00] mismanagement it's it's going to be here
[35:02] for quite some time right and look I
[35:06] mean you've seen in other countries
[35:07] right people people function even if the
[35:09] currency is losing 10% of its value per
[35:11] year it's not it's not ideal I certainly
[35:14] don't think it's optimal it distorts
[35:15] things but people can get by on that and
[35:17] if they feel like they don't immediately
[35:19] have a better alternative they go you're
[35:21] actually seeing a lot more countries now
[35:23] look at potentially switching to the
[35:25] dollar simply because it's it's an
[35:28] improvement right and also you have that
[35:31] stability
[35:32] because um that's why actually I'm an
[35:35] advocate for um I mentioned this in the
[35:38] simply Bitcoin podcast I'm an advocate
[35:39] for tools that let people SE separate
[35:42] the price of Bitcoin from the properties
[35:44] of Bitcoin because there's some people
[35:47] that want exposure to the price but not
[35:49] the properties right these are just the
[35:51] investors so for them right if they
[35:54] wanted to invest in gold they don't want
[35:56] a gold bar sitting around their house
[35:58] they just want a piece of you know they
[36:00] want a digital certificate that fits in
[36:03] their existing stock portfolios and then
[36:05] someone else you know deals with the
[36:07] physical bar and the security and
[36:08] insurance and making sure it's real um
[36:11] so there's people who want that they
[36:13] want the Bitcoin spot ETF so they don't
[36:15] have to think about the properties of
[36:17] Bitcoin they could just get the price
[36:18] and then there's people who want the
[36:20] properties of Bitcoin that they can hold
[36:21] it themselves that it doesn't require an
[36:23] account um but they don't want the price
[36:26] to be going up and down because they
[36:28] have expenses you know at the end of the
[36:30] month that are denominated in dollars or
[36:33] something roughly equivalent to dollars
[36:34] or dollar is the the stablest thing they
[36:37] can find right if you know you have an
[36:39] expense of $1,000 a month there's no
[36:42] amount of Bitcoin you could have that
[36:44] guarantees you can make that thousand
[36:47] payment see what I
[36:49] mean if you have $2,000 of Bitcoin and
[36:52] you owe $1,000 at the end of the month
[36:55] what happens if Bitcoin drops more than
[36:57] 50% by the end of the month then you
[36:59] can't make that payment so that's where
[37:03] certain tools I mean DLCs is the one I'm
[37:05] most excited about discrete log
[37:07] contracts um that that will let you
[37:10] essentially offset that volatility so
[37:12] you can get the properties to bitcoin
[37:14] without the price fluctuation for the
[37:15] people who can't handle it or don't wish
[37:17] to or just don't want the accounting
[37:22] headache interesting um because you
[37:25] mentioned it quickly what are your
[37:28] thoughts about this Bitcoin spot ETF
[37:31] coming up uh in Gold histories it was a
[37:34] big deal it was like a huge Catalyst for
[37:37] priz and adoption uh do you imagine
[37:39] something similar for
[37:41] Bitcoin yeah I do think so the first
[37:44] spot gold ETF was 2005 and the next
[37:47] eight years were just gold going going
[37:50] up from there
[37:52] um and uh the thing about Bitcoin is
[37:55] Bitcoin is actually a smaller Market
[37:57] than gold is so it's possible that
[37:59] will'll have an even more dramatic
[38:01] impact on that um the other things that
[38:04] people have mentioned is that with
[38:06] multiple spot ETFs at the same time that
[38:08] means there's a marketing budget right
[38:10] these different entities want to compete
[38:12] with each other and they have to try to
[38:14] distinguish themselves and say no no no
[38:15] you should buy mine you should buy mine
[38:17] because they get to just collect fees
[38:18] every year
[38:20] for not not doing very much right that's
[38:23] a good business basically they they hold
[38:25] on to your money and they just take some
[38:27] of it every year um they don't have to
[38:31] make a lot of they're not trying to make
[38:32] investing decisions or something right
[38:34] it's a matter of marketing and
[38:36] operations um and then the other thing
[38:38] is just adds a lot more legitimacy it
[38:41] really helps when uh other entities are
[38:44] thinking about Bitcoin they say oh yeah
[38:46] there's there's a spot ETF black rocks
[38:49] um you know involved Fidelity involved
[38:51] this kind of thing that that changes the
[38:53] way it's perceived and potentially even
[38:56] helps in terms of the regulatory
[38:57] environment right because there's
[38:59] there's still a risk that Bitcoin could
[39:01] be outlawed and um a lot of people don't
[39:05] realize that that's that's a concern but
[39:07] you have to understand in the US they
[39:09] the US outlawed alcohol when something
[39:12] like 95% of Americans drink
[39:17] alcohol so we're we're certainly not at
[39:19] 95% of Americans using
[39:21] Bitcoin um and even then we're we're not
[39:24] out of the woods on that right so there
[39:26] that's very disruptive that would drive
[39:28] a lot of businesses
[39:32] elsewhere but there's a difference
[39:34] between outlawed and killing it uh do
[39:38] you still think uh Bitcoin can be killed
[39:40] by just outlawing
[39:43] it
[39:45] no so so yeah the the the cost to kill
[39:49] Bitcoin has been rising right um
[39:52] somebody in you know a board person in
[39:55] 2009 maybe could have done if they
[39:57] wanted to right and then in by you know
[39:59] 2012 it would it would require an
[40:02] eccentric millionaire and uh you know by
[40:06] by 20 uh you know 2017 it requires you
[40:10] know a small nation state
[40:13] um we're not fully out of the woods here
[40:16] um but it it just seems like the the
[40:18] remaining entities that have the
[40:20] billions of dollars necessary to disable
[40:23] Bitcoin and the Machinery to disable
[40:25] Bitcoin are no longer interested in
[40:26] doing so right and at that point it
[40:29] would involve you know cutting undersea
[40:31] power cables um confiscating the assets
[40:34] from ETFs and
[40:36] exchanges um you know using uh weapons
[40:41] um I don't like people to say anything
[40:43] is Invincible because complacency is bad
[40:46] and uh it is important to recognize that
[40:49] there are entities around the world that
[40:50] have nuclear
[40:52] weapons we're fortunate that they're not
[40:55] using them of course but they
[41:00] can but they are way more like it would
[41:04] be a way smarter move for them to join
[41:07] it than to kill it like that's the whole
[41:10] thing of the game here right exactly the
[41:12] game theory of Bitcoin is pretty
[41:14] beautiful that it actually makes much
[41:15] more sense you see when a country is
[41:18] saying we're we're pro Bitcoin all of a
[41:20] sudden there's a lot more money a lot
[41:21] more tourists flowing in there um if
[41:24] they say they're anti- Bitcoin that that
[41:26] doesn't help them at all and certainly
[41:28] for a country uh recently Samson said he
[41:32] was in suram and talked to the president
[41:34] there and jam was apparently considering
[41:38] putting 1% of their reserves into
[41:40] Bitcoin and the nice thing about that is
[41:42] from their perspective they might not
[41:44] believe in Bitcoin right so maybe they
[41:45] think oh Bitcoin doesn't go anywhere or
[41:47] goes down well they're only risking 1%
[41:49] right but if Bitcoin does do really
[41:52] really really well as many people think
[41:54] it you know it could from here um that
[41:57] 1% could become 20% 50%
[42:01] 90% uh so it it's still that asymmetric
[42:04] B it still makes more sense for entities
[42:08] to think I should have a little and just
[42:10] in case and then that that changes it
[42:13] that point they they're not against it
[42:15] right they're more open to it um we we
[42:19] still kind of have this problem where
[42:20] there entities like there's some um
[42:23] newspapers right they think oh we can't
[42:25] allow any of our Journal to own any
[42:27] Bitcoin because they'll be biased the
[42:29] problem is the journalists own dollars
[42:32] right so if the Bitcoin and the dollar
[42:33] are competing to some degree then they
[42:36] are very much biased right like if
[42:39] somebody has all their stock in oil
[42:40] companies and they're not alow allowed
[42:42] to own any stock in Tesla and then you
[42:44] expect them to be unbiased writing
[42:45] articles about Tesla no they're they're
[42:47] very much they're very much biased there
[42:49] so that hopefully that you know that
[42:52] will change over time right that people
[42:54] will realize that um you know nobody's
[42:56] unbiased here so you should at least
[42:58] have a little exposure to this and then
[43:00] people can consider okay what do I think
[43:03] of this and it doesn't have to be based
[43:05] on trying to talk up their
[43:08] book and wouldn't you not even prefer
[43:12] information from someone that has
[43:14] exposure because this person most likely
[43:17] has done more research than a person
[43:20] that has no exposure at all like just
[43:22] from my point of view of course it's
[43:24] it's also uh
[43:27] interesting to see the opposite view
[43:29] then just just to to get the whole to
[43:32] get the whole point but like I wanted to
[43:35] have like when I see someone speaking
[43:38] about it about something and they don't
[43:41] have exposure at all to the thing they
[43:44] are speaking about I'm like you you you
[43:46] don't even like you're not involved like
[43:49] why are you talking about
[43:51] that yeah yeah I mean
[43:53] that that is it right at least at least
[43:56] people should send one Bitcoin
[43:58] transaction right or you know set up 12
[44:01] words on a Harware wallet at least to
[44:03] just know what they're talking about um
[44:05] that's been one of the the frustrating
[44:07] things I've run into because sometimes I
[44:08] have spent time talking with uh you know
[44:12] people who just hate Bitcoin right I I
[44:14] call them no coiners and I tell them
[44:16] like you know you're telling me that uh
[44:18] you know 90% of transactions on
[44:20] Lightning fail and I'm like okay well
[44:22] it's not 90% of my transactions that
[44:24] fail is it 90% of your transactions that
[44:26] fail and they're like well I've never
[44:27] sent one I'm like well can I can I send
[44:29] you one now no no no no you know so they
[44:32] um some people just seem really
[44:34] committed to uh to staying in their
[44:37] bubble they they don't want any facts to
[44:39] break through uh because it can be
[44:42] disturbing when you realize you are
[44:44] wrong about something and that's
[44:45] happened to me in my life where I
[44:47] realized you know some thought I I I
[44:50] believe for a long time it turns out
[44:51] it's not true I was wrong um and that
[44:54] that doesn't feel good right right
[44:56] initially right but then you realize
[44:57] okay but I'm less wrong than I was
[44:59] before so that's
[45:01] progress um the good thing is we don't
[45:04] need to convince those people right the
[45:05] people who are completely opposed to
[45:08] bitcoin no matter what they don't need
[45:10] to be brought along for the ride they're
[45:11] not 99% of the population they were just
[45:14] a different 1% than the 1% of people who
[45:17] love Bitcoin for some
[45:20] reason my story was that I was actually
[45:24] like I was a stock investor I was uh
[45:27] someone that was really highly Val
[45:30] valuing the stock flow like the the the
[45:34] the revenue the profits and if it did
[45:37] not had a cash flow I did not invest in
[45:41] it and so in 2020 more and more people
[45:44] came up to me and what are you thinking
[45:46] about this Bitcoin thing and I said no
[45:50] it's a scam I don't like it and then I
[45:53] was going to from more and more
[45:55] arguments and I was discovering I don't
[45:57] have any arguments actually so I was on
[45:59] the journey like finding arguments
[46:01] against Bitcoin and I was discovering
[46:03] that I was just wrong that was a hard
[46:05] thing to to do when you are telling
[46:08] people and friends that Bitcoin is a
[46:10] scam and then you research about it and
[46:12] you're like oh [ __ ] I should have
[46:15] researched before I open my mouth and
[46:17] also my guest I think three weeks ago or
[46:20] three episodes ago said you should not
[46:22] have a valid opinion on bitcoin if you
[46:24] did not study it at at least for 250
[46:28] hours so right but then but then becomes
[46:31] the challenge right because if someone
[46:33] says to you oh you can't have an opinion
[46:35] on uh on China unless you've lived there
[46:37] for five years well you know that you
[46:40] know or someone says oh you know you
[46:42] can't you know someone is you know
[46:44] taking hallucinogenic drugs and they
[46:46] insist you can't have an opinion on that
[46:47] unless you do it also right that that
[46:49] becomes that becomes a problem right
[46:51] because some some things you can do
[46:53] without it you know potentially having a
[46:56] massive negative impact on yourself
[46:59] so that's all right so I you know I
[47:02] would I don't think it's fair to say to
[47:03] someone oh you need to have a lot of
[47:05] Bitcoin or something you need to be
[47:06] deeply invested in it to have an opinion
[47:08] but just to just to learn a little bit
[47:11] um and with an open mind just to
[47:13] interact with it in some way a little
[47:15] bit I think that is really
[47:17] helpful
[47:19] um yeah so so for me um my uh a long
[47:23] time ago I was on a Commodities trading
[47:25] floor
[47:26] and uh it was it's pretty amazing to see
[47:29] people trading trading gold over there
[47:32] trading oil over there trading sugar
[47:34] over there trading cotton over there and
[47:37] each area of the floor it's just people
[47:39] running around waving their
[47:40] arms you know and uh asked somebody I
[47:44] said what's the price of sugar and
[47:45] they're like 13 I said 13 what and
[47:47] they're like I don't
[47:50] know because the unit doesn't matter you
[47:53] know they bought 13 they sold 14 they
[47:55] made money
[47:57] money um bought the amount of sugar like
[48:01] was a kilo what what was
[48:04] 13 yeah I mean the usually the contract
[48:06] sizes were were like pretty large maybe
[48:09] around
[48:10] $100,000 right so um like the the
[48:14] standard uh contract for gold was 100
[48:17] ounces of
[48:19] gold right the standard contract for for
[48:22] oil is uh I think th th barrels of
[48:27] oil so you know those are those are
[48:30] pretty large
[48:31] quantities
[48:33] um but uh so what I found was the uh the
[48:37] Commodities people a whole bunch of the
[48:39] people I knew from back then they they
[48:41] ended up making their way over to
[48:42] bitcoin and I think it was easier for
[48:44] them to understand it right because they
[48:46] were they were thinking they weren't
[48:47] thinking in terms of cash flow and they
[48:49] were a little more open to hey this is
[48:52] just a different thing I can buy and
[48:54] sell um
[48:56] whereas people from the the stock stock
[48:58] environment I yeah they're looking at
[49:00] they like where's the yield here right
[49:02] this that doesn't that doesn't make
[49:03] sense if I just buy some gold bars why
[49:05] should I expect those to be worth a lot
[49:07] more in the future and really you
[49:09] shouldn't right
[49:12] uh so so you know sometimes you do have
[49:15] Commodities rallies but the thing is
[49:17] commodity rallies and then they they can
[49:19] dig up more of it they can produce more
[49:22] of it they can melt it down from
[49:24] different places they can figure F out
[49:25] how to use less of it right when copper
[49:27] rallied dramatically they figured out
[49:29] how to redesign air conditioners to use
[49:31] less copper um when the price of oil
[49:34] went above $100 a barrel they realized
[49:37] oh well this Canadian shell is now
[49:40] viable that wasn't before so we just
[49:42] have way way way way more oil than
[49:45] anybody really really thought they did
[49:48] um you know at a certain price of gold
[49:50] you can just extract it from ocean water
[49:53] basically it's just not economically
[49:56] viable to do so and anywhere near the
[49:58] current
[49:59] prices right there are asteroids out
[50:01] there that potentially have incredible
[50:03] amounts of different precious metals um
[50:05] just the cost of retrieving them is uh
[50:07] is very high
[50:10] so uh Bitcoin really is kind of unique
[50:12] in that the Bitcoin price runs up yeah
[50:15] more people go into Mining and maybe
[50:17] maybe they're being stupid right maybe
[50:19] too many people are mining but it
[50:21] doesn't matter if hundred times more
[50:23] people are mining they don't produce any
[50:24] more Bitcoin
[50:27] whereas if you look at some of the
[50:28] classic gold rushes right they
[50:30] discovered gold and you know late 1840s
[50:33] in California people come from all over
[50:35] the world to start digging up that gold
[50:38] and uh yeah they get a lot more gold a
[50:41] lot more hits the supply of the market
[50:44] um regardless of whether you know most
[50:46] of those people ended up making a lot of
[50:48] money or not some people did but a lot
[50:49] of people
[50:51] didn't um so so yeah I I I think the
[50:55] reason that Bitcoin has had outsize
[50:57] returns and may have some outsize
[50:58] returns left is simply because it's it's
[51:00] just undervalued right it's it's kind of
[51:03] like going to uh you know South America
[51:05] in the 1500s or something and there's
[51:08] just plentiful gold and it's not as
[51:10] valued as highly as it was in Europe at
[51:12] the time so they can trade other
[51:14] commodities for gold at uh at very
[51:16] favorable prices right and come back to
[51:18] Europe and be rich
[51:21] um so I think there's this basically
[51:23] onetime thing that Bitcoin is very
[51:26] undervalued relative to what what it's
[51:28] worth once people recognize what it is
[51:30] once there's a large circular economy in
[51:32] it um so you can buy Bitcoin at that
[51:36] discount right so you can think of let's
[51:38] say you know whatever put pick some
[51:40] number right let these people have been
[51:41] running around saying a million dollars
[51:43] so let's say you know you're you're
[51:45] buying Bitcoin at 10,000 you're buying
[51:46] no you're buying at a 99% discount right
[51:51] and if you're buying it at 50,000 you're
[51:52] buying at 95% discount right and if you
[51:56] buying Bitcoin at you know 500,000
[51:58] you're buying a 50% discount cool but if
[52:00] you buy Bitcoin at a million dollars
[52:02] there's in this scenario right there's
[52:04] no reason to think you're going to make
[52:05] money from that or at least not in
[52:07] excess of any other particular
[52:09] investment once it gets closer to a fair
[52:12] value then you can have those outsize
[52:15] returns right and people want to say
[52:16] well it could keep going up in dollar
[52:18] value forever yeah well that's true
[52:20] right but by this the same thing you
[52:23] know you can say oh well in Zimbabwe
[52:24] dollars you know you're a trillionaire
[52:26] but that doesn't mean anything the
[52:27] question is how much food can you buy
[52:29] how much land can you buy right can you
[52:31] buy a house with a Bitcoin and I could
[52:33] certainly see a scenario where a Bitcoin
[52:35] buys a nice house but I don't see a
[52:37] scenario in which Bitcoin buys 10,000
[52:39] nice
[52:40] houses that just doesn't make
[52:43] sense are we reaching fair value when
[52:48] everybody adopted Bitcoin like what's
[52:51] where is the stop for Bitcoin where's
[52:53] the fair value reached
[52:57] um yeah that that's a that's a tricky
[52:59] question right and people have
[53:00] approached it different ways um
[53:04] one question before that is you know
[53:07] what percentage of people are going to
[53:10] be part of this Bitcoin economy right
[53:12] and there's the tendency for bitcoiners
[53:15] to say oh well you know bitcoin's either
[53:17] going to be wildly successful or total
[53:19] failure and uh even Satoshi said
[53:21] something like that he said oh yeah you
[53:23] know in the future there'll either be a
[53:24] very large transaction volume or none at
[53:26] all but it doesn't have to be that
[53:29] that's uh it doesn't have to be one
[53:31] extreme or the other right maybe Bitcoin
[53:33] is successful but it doesn't become the
[53:35] world currency maybe it just is used by
[53:38] you know millions of people and that's
[53:40] it or it's used by a billion people I
[53:42] mean even if Bitcoin is used by a
[53:44] billion people that's still the majority
[53:46] of the world never uses
[53:47] it so is that a success is that failure
[53:50] I think it's I think it's a pretty good
[53:52] success maybe it's not the full
[53:54] potential um um but I think it still
[53:56] could be fine um so it really
[53:59] depends on bitcoin's ability to scale
[54:02] and to build some other
[54:05] improvements that will make it more
[54:07] practical for regular people as well as
[54:09] you know have regular people getting
[54:10] more security um on their uh on their
[54:14] computers and phones as I said
[54:16] because right now it's it's not good
[54:18] enough right people still have the
[54:20] mentality of oh I'll just I forgot my
[54:22] password I'll ask them to reset it or
[54:25] you know some random person calls them
[54:26] and they start giving them all sorts of
[54:29] sensitive information um as long as
[54:31] we're in that scenario it's it's still
[54:34] it's still more difficult uh for people
[54:36] to be able to handle digital bear or
[54:38] cash in this in this
[54:41] way um so so yeah I don't I don't know
[54:44] what the I don't know what the fair
[54:45] value is I I mean my kind of internal
[54:47] estimate is you know one Bitcoin equals
[54:49] one nice house and land but you know it
[54:53] could it could be higher than that
[54:54] because
[54:55] you could look at things like okay maybe
[54:57] the total addressable Market is actually
[54:59] more than a billion people right because
[55:01] now we see with artificial intelligence
[55:04] with robots um it makes much more sense
[55:07] for them to use something like Bitcoin
[55:09] than it does any other currency right um
[55:12] I I I can't imagine chat GPT is going to
[55:15] run around paying for API access or for
[55:17] data sets using gold coins or credit
[55:21] cards or bank accounts or paper currency
[55:25] see you know writing checks the doesn't
[55:29] make sense you know even if the
[55:31] traditional Fiat system could
[55:32] accommodate it they wouldn't or they
[55:35] won't in a reasonable amount of time um
[55:37] whereas just Bitcoin simply natively
[55:40] Works uh it's kind of funny with things
[55:43] like Amazon Turk where they're kind of
[55:46] farming out microtasks to people um
[55:50] there's things like that right if you're
[55:52] paying in Bitcoin then it kind of works
[55:54] you don't know what whether you're
[55:55] paying a robot or a person or what
[55:57] country they're in exactly um it kind of
[56:00] abstracts that away it works much nicer
[56:02] than any traditional system right
[56:04] already we see with companies that are
[56:06] spread out with their employees all over
[56:08] the world Bitcoin is actually the
[56:10] easiest way to do
[56:11] it so so it's possible we have a
[56:14] addressable Market that's much much
[56:16] bigger than anybody thinks which would
[56:18] be neat we'll see what see what that
[56:20] looks
[56:22] like I think that's a a great way to end
[56:25] it we have a end routine on the podcast
[56:28] where the previous guests previous guest
[56:31] asks the next guest without knowing who
[56:34] the next guest is uh question and the
[56:37] question for you is what is proof of
[56:40] work for you and you can interpret it uh
[56:43] and uh take it wherever you want you
[56:47] want to take
[56:48] it um yeah I mean I I I I like the
[56:54] bitcoin's proof of of work it's actually
[56:56] pretty elegant and and that you have
[56:58] something that's uh you know you can
[57:00] adjust the difficulty to whatever you
[57:01] want and people can verify it very
[57:04] easily without having to actually
[57:05] recreate all that work um I actually
[57:09] know someone who's uh you know Fitness
[57:11] fitness instructor personal uh you know
[57:14] just you know coaching and so on and he
[57:16] created a proof of work telegram group
[57:18] recently and
