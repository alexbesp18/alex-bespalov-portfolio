[00:00] we're kind of moving in a new bull here
[00:01] 2025 it's possible that this will occur
[00:05] coinciding with lower interest rates and
[00:08] more money printing which we had in a
[00:11] big way in 2020 so the monetary based
[00:14] industry increased 10 trillion which is
[00:17] just insane past 2032 and you're getting
[00:20] somewhere around the 7080 trillion value
[00:24] and it's somewhere around there that I
[00:25] think Bitcoin will meet that value you
[00:28] see that Bitcoin is growing way way
[00:29] faster than the monetary base even
[00:31] though we talk about they print a lot of
[00:32] money it's only 12.7% per year here
[00:35] Bitcoin grows at 45% per year one big
[00:37] nation state decides to say all right
[00:39] we're going to start reserving Bitcoin
[00:40] we're going to put it on our books and
[00:42] then that just sends the demand for
[00:44] Bitcoin through the roof markets can be
[00:45] more arational for longer than you have
[00:47] Capital it's like a nominal value of
[00:49] gold for the United States very small
[00:51] and people even wonder if it's even
[00:52] there that's why Bitcoin is a great safe
[00:53] haven right it's just a great place to
[00:55] escape from all this noise they're going
[00:57] to have to buy more assets if they want
[00:58] to keep these interest rates coming
[01:00] lower and if they do that then Bitcoin
[01:02] might line up perfectly in the next
[01:03] cycle 2024 2025 you know that means 30
[01:06] cents out of every dollar was basically
[01:07] printed by the central bank that is a
[01:10] record it's number five it has passed
[01:12] the bank of England's balance sheet you
[01:14] have the dollar you have the Euro you
[01:16] have the Yen you have the Yuan after
[01:17] that you have now Bitcoin at 1.2
[01:21] [Music]
[01:23] trillion the first thing I want really
[01:25] want to get into is uh Nation nation
[01:28] state adoption of Bitcoin it seems to be
[01:30] a a faster and faster coming topic like
[01:33] in 2021 2020 we had the the companies
[01:37] adopting Bitcoin the publicly traded
[01:38] companies with micro strategy Tesla and
[01:40] all the other things that came after
[01:42] that uh and now we seems to Ender in a
[01:45] new era where like nation states and the
[01:48] US is talking about it how fast do you
[01:50] think this all will come and how will
[01:53] this develop for the nation states
[01:55] adopting Bitcoin as a strategic Reserve
[01:58] asset yeah it's a great question uh you
[02:01] know the old saying gradually and then
[02:03] suddenly uh it seems it happens that way
[02:07] in finance and markets uh and perhaps
[02:11] perhaps a Betty man would take that it's
[02:13] going to be somewhat of a similar
[02:14] scenario I think here with this as far
[02:17] as when that suddenly actually occurs I
[02:20] think it's difficult to tell um this
[02:25] next round of
[02:27] Bitcoin adoption
[02:30] which I'm generally measuring as far as
[02:33] you know most people know these fouryear
[02:35] cycles that come after the having and uh
[02:38] we're kind of moving into perhaps a new
[02:40] bull here right going into 2025 it's
[02:43] possible that this will occur coinciding
[02:48] with lower interest rates and more money
[02:51] printing which we had in a big way in uh
[02:56] 2020 and 2021 we did but we uh uh we had
[03:00] never really had that before in
[03:02] bitcoin's history so it would be
[03:05] interesting if Bitcoin kind of repeats
[03:09] what happened in 2020 2021 and all of a
[03:11] sudden we're sort of lined up with these
[03:13] cycles of basically central banks print
[03:16] more money to deal with whatever
[03:19] problems they might see in the economy
[03:20] and then
[03:21] Bitcoin you know gets these next level
[03:24] up phases of adoption during these times
[03:27] uh this would be the second time this
[03:30] would have happened right and if this
[03:31] happens indeed on these fouryear Cycles
[03:33] it would be it would be interesting um I
[03:36] can I can draw some trend lines for you
[03:38] on those
[03:40] possibilities we could talk about that
[03:42] but um I think if you look at these uh
[03:48] things in these fouryear cycles and you
[03:50] look at the trend lines that Bitcoin uh
[03:53] currently is on uh I think it's probably
[03:56] you're not going to match what is what
[03:58] is uh called base money the nation
[04:00] states monetary um liabilities on their
[04:03] balance sheet probably for another 10
[04:06] years probably for another two
[04:10] [Music]
[04:21] [Music]
[04:29] money uh if I'm not mistaken that's
[04:32] right what what does base money mean for
[04:34] those who don't know about it yeah yeah
[04:37] so when uh I started my podcast in
[04:41] 2017 uh we were my former co-host uh is
[04:45] a gentleman named Fernando ol he has a
[04:47] good YouTube channel down in Brazil uh
[04:50] now and he um and I were asking a lot of
[04:54] economists what they thought Bitcoin was
[04:56] ontologically you know sort of an Apples
[04:58] to Apples comparison with the things in
[05:00] the market what does it actually what
[05:02] does it actually mean uh Bitcoin you
[05:04] know the supply of 21 million Bitcoin
[05:07] what does it actually mean in in in the
[05:08] real world economy some
[05:10] comparisons and we perhaps were the
[05:13] first people that settled on this idea
[05:14] that it was uh it was was what is called
[05:18] base money or the monetary base
[05:21] Supply and what that is is basically two
[05:23] things the first thing most people
[05:25] understand it's whatever the cash that a
[05:27] central bank uh prints that they usually
[05:30] in their in their wallet or under their
[05:31] mattress or in a in a safe um so all the
[05:34] Euros Yen dollars the actual physical
[05:37] currency that is part of the monetary
[05:39] base and then the other part is it's
[05:42] called the bank reserve and the bank
[05:43] reserve is basically each banks in a
[05:48] central bank system so in Europe for
[05:51] example you know you have the uh we have
[05:54] a we have actually a two-tiered system
[05:55] in Europe right we have each each nation
[05:57] in Europe has the in the Euro zone of
[05:59] course I'm speaking speaking about we
[06:00] have you know the bundis bank in Germany
[06:02] and then above that we have the ECB in
[06:05] Frankfurt the European Central Bank and
[06:07] of course uh all of those uh banks that
[06:11] are in Europe you know Society general
[06:14] or um you know I don't even know what
[06:17] Spar Spar bank right what's what's a big
[06:19] German Bank yeah the the the DOA bank I
[06:22] think it's one of the the biggest one
[06:23] Deutsche Bank of course so uh anyway all
[06:27] of these Banks they have an account with
[06:30] the central bank and that's called the
[06:32] actual account that they hold with the
[06:34] central bank it's called the master
[06:35] account sometimes or the main account uh
[06:38] the value that is in that account is is
[06:41] the digital portion of the base money
[06:43] and that's called The Bank Reserves so
[06:45] so to summarize monetary base means all
[06:47] the physical currency in circulation
[06:50] cash and coins and the Bank Reserves
[06:54] which uh is each each bank that has a
[06:56] charter in in the banking system their
[06:58] account with the Central Bank so if you
[07:00] add all those things up you can kind of
[07:02] get a flavor of what competes with
[07:05] Bitcoin today at the core of the
[07:08] financial
[07:09] system and uh it's one of the things
[07:12] I've been doing for for a few years now
[07:14] since about 2018 I've been putting these
[07:15] reports out every quarter which I'm
[07:17] basically going through all the central
[07:19] bank's balance sheets trying to
[07:21] calculate the stuff the monetary base
[07:23] and um we just finished the third
[07:25] quarter it's going to take a while uh
[07:28] about a month to get the next quarter
[07:29] out out but it's done as of
[07:31] June and that money that all that money
[07:34] together roughly is about 26.1 trillion
[07:37] dollars as of uh as of the Q2
[07:43] 2024 so that's it and the theory is that
[07:47] all that will at some point be one base
[07:50] money as as your Twitter handle is like
[07:52] that will all be Bitcoin uh once we are
[07:56] at the final stage it's also interesting
[07:58] when when we think about that and then
[08:01] also it seems like you said like
[08:02] competing with with those things um but
[08:05] Bitcoin is also competing kind of with
[08:07] real estate and and with with other
[08:09] assets to a certain extents because we
[08:12] have a bad base money and that's why
[08:14] people are fleeing to to all the other
[08:16] places so kind of we had to we would
[08:18] have to include in in that calculation
[08:21] all the other monetary premiums of maybe
[08:24] like golden and other assets in there
[08:27] that's kind of hard to kind of to
[08:29] calculate uh what the full potential
[08:31] then for for Bitcoin actually is right
[08:34] yeah I mean I think it's a good point
[08:36] to theorize and of course many people do
[08:39] theorize on this is how much of this
[08:41] monetary premium as you said is uh
[08:44] people moving away from a weaker
[08:46] currency as they do governments as we
[08:49] know in Bitcoin that's what why we why
[08:51] we do Bitcoin government's print more
[08:53] than the demand is you know to fund
[08:55] their programs whatever it is and that
[08:59] uh diminishes the demand for cash
[09:01] balances that people would normally have
[09:03] so they go into something else like you
[09:04] said Real Estate stocks bonds whatever
[09:07] it might be I don't approach it that way
[09:10] um I do do a lot of charts where you're
[09:13] comparing the growth of stocks or bonds
[09:15] or whatever to bitcoin and I think
[09:17] that's interesting but yeah like you
[09:19] said it's it's hard to calculate and
[09:20] it's not something that I'm uh I'm doing
[09:23] basically so it's it's there I'm sure
[09:26] and I think that in a hyper Bitcoin ized
[09:30] world the monetary premium of real
[09:32] estate would come way down you know will
[09:34] it go to zero will it just be you know
[09:36] the actual utility the real estate I'm
[09:38] not sure I don't know um you know the
[09:41] economy is a wild thing right it's hard
[09:43] to predict sometimes but what we can in
[09:47] point of fact calculate still is this uh
[09:51] is this amount of
[09:54] currency that is in the the world and we
[09:57] can see how Bitcoin compares to that
[10:00] and uh and then you know and then and
[10:02] then see how the growth goes and I do
[10:05] think that this is like I said this goes
[10:07] back to your first question it's going
[10:09] to take a long longer time than people
[10:11] probably think um you know this is a
[10:14] generational thing um you know every
[10:18] four years it seems like a new crop of
[10:19] young people get interested in Bitcoin
[10:21] that's one theory of how this stuff
[10:23] works uh of course there's many things
[10:25] going on obviously with Mining and and
[10:27] the markets in general but I uh you know
[10:30] you can have this monetary base value of
[10:33] Bitcoin grow you can have the value of
[10:35] gold market grow and gold by the way is
[10:37] a is a past based money it's not really
[10:39] M money anymore Al those Banks and
[10:41] central banks still do hold some gold
[10:44] about 15% of it uh of the world's total
[10:47] central banks do hold so you know these
[10:49] are different buckets of value and I'm
[10:51] not I'm not um trying to focus so much
[10:54] on like the real estate or whatever
[10:56] because those things aren't money you
[10:57] know at the end of the day they may have
[10:58] a monetary PR but they're not money so
[11:00] so gold silver Bitcoin monetary base
[11:03] these are money supplies that I'm
[11:05] focused on because they uh they they
[11:08] have the title of money absolutely it's
[11:11] also interesting uh you mentioned the
[11:12] fouryear cycle already two times um do
[11:14] you think that foure cycle will vanish
[11:18] at some point because like the Haring
[11:20] impact is not as big anymore we have a
[11:23] lot of different impacts like the ETF
[11:25] and stuff like that coming into place is
[11:27] that will that still prevail
[11:30] over the time yeah I I think it will uh
[11:34] diminish the impact of it will diminish
[11:36] I think it like I said though at least
[11:37] two more Habs uh you're still going to
[11:39] see a pretty big impact because adoption
[11:41] is still low relative to other
[11:44] valuations other things in the market
[11:47] and we have this you know it's it's a
[11:48] fairly big shock still to the mining
[11:50] industry which is not a large industry
[11:53] actually um you know you're talk if you
[11:55] added up the the revenue of all of the
[11:59] co coin base right the new coins that
[12:00] come out every 10 minutes plus the fees
[12:02] you know you're you're talking 15 20
[12:05] billion maybe right now uh per year in
[12:09] dollar value and that's that's a decent
[12:12] Siz industry but there are many
[12:13] Industries you know oil is like trillion
[12:15] dollar industry there's a there's a lot
[12:16] more money sloshing around in other
[12:18] Industries and I think it's going to
[12:19] take a you got to wait until Bitcoin
[12:22] really gets up to those types of
[12:24] Industries to uh to see what what
[12:27] happens you know during covid the base
[12:29] money industry Itself by the way and I
[12:32] can show you a chart if you want uh here
[12:34] yeah please please yeah so this is like
[12:36] just a just a flavor of what I uh
[12:40] publish
[12:41] sometimes is so here's
[12:44] the here's the uh the the total amount
[12:48] of of uh the monetary bases what I
[12:50] calculate here and so if you look at
[12:52] just the Delta it was about 20 trillion
[12:55] equivalent uh just before covid January
[12:58] 2020 20 21 trillion and then all that co
[13:02] covid uh money printing in the space of
[13:05] you know basically a year little over a
[13:08] year went up 10 trillion so at this so
[13:13] the monetary based industry the industry
[13:15] for printing money increased 10 trillion
[13:18] uh during Co which is just insane I mean
[13:21] it's it's was just an absolute insane
[13:24] amount of money Printing and you can see
[13:25] that they've tried to pull it back
[13:27] down uh since then and now we're at
[13:29] about 26.1 trillion so I mentioned that
[13:32] as well and then if you go out um this
[13:35] is a trend line exponential regression
[13:38] you see the fit is really good 99% R
[13:40] squar so we're actually under trend of
[13:43] this worldwide the trend Line's about 35
[13:45] or uh 30 uh sorry what it 32 trillion go
[13:49] all the way out to uh two more
[13:59] you're getting somewhere around the 7080
[14:02] trillion doll uh value and it's
[14:05] somewhere around there that I think
[14:06] Bitcoin will will meet that value uh I'm
[14:10] not showing you Pro projecting out the
[14:12] market cap and stuff but you just take
[14:14] my word for it for now that I think
[14:15] that's that's what happens and uh this
[14:19] is this is how we can see that stuff
[14:21] like disc grows on uh exponential scale
[14:24] because we put it on log scale it
[14:25] becomes a straight line and um and this
[14:29] is this is this is a lot of what my
[14:31] research has been so it's been
[14:32] collecting all of this data uh I start
[14:35] this chart you know since basically the
[14:36] United States went off the gold standard
[14:38] in
[14:39] 1971 started in 1969 December you know
[14:42] you had something like a hundred billion
[14:44] dollars $150 billion in base money here
[14:47] and then with all the money
[14:49] printing um it's it's now 26 trillion in
[14:53] was 30 uh a couple years ago so and that
[14:57] represents by the way a growth rate of
[14:59] about
[15:00] 12.7% per year
[15:03] 12.7%
[15:05] so uh Bitcoin is on a much faster growth
[15:08] rate by the way the the growth rate of
[15:10] bitcoin's trend line I can show you
[15:13] Bitcoin by the way here's Bitcoin
[15:15] Bitcoin is a power curve so perhaps
[15:17] you've seen on Twitter you know people
[15:19] talking about the power regression I
[15:21] also been working on this since like
[15:23] 2018 drawing charts like this and uh a
[15:28] power curve is curved on the log scale
[15:32] so this is the old Bitcoin price on log
[15:33] scale it's not a straight line so it's a
[15:36] little bit it's an ASM totically
[15:37] decaying curve but if you looked at the
[15:40] slope of this curve when it was you know
[15:42] sub one penny back in 2010 now the the
[15:45] actual regression of the black line is
[15:47] $80,000 you looked at the slope of that
[15:49] curve that's like 160% per year 160% per
[15:52] year the slope of the curve and of
[15:54] course it was faster at the beginning
[15:56] slower now and the the slope of the
[15:59] curve right now precisely right now like
[16:01] from one day to the next is 45%
[16:04] annualized so right there you can see
[16:06] that Bitcoin is growing way way faster
[16:09] than the monetary base monetary base
[16:12] that we just talked about cash and coin
[16:14] the central bank's print even though we
[16:15] talk about they print a lot of money a
[16:16] lot a lot of money it's only 12.7% per
[16:19] year here Bitcoin grows at 45% per
[16:22] year so uh so that's basically uh the
[16:27] the one growth factor is that that the
[16:29] money is just getting debased at a 12%
[16:33] rate and the other cow fact is that
[16:35] people are discovering Bitcoin and then
[16:39] uh getting into into Bitcoin as an
[16:42] adopting so like the one is the growth
[16:44] factor and the out of one is a debasing
[16:47] factor yeah Y and they you know they're
[16:51] they're going to converge together but
[16:53] uh like I said I think you got to wait
[16:54] two more Habs for at least those values
[16:56] to to match then of course you have like
[16:59] I said this gradually then suddenly
[17:01] thing maybe uh maybe one big nation
[17:04] state decides to say all right we're
[17:05] going to start reserving Bitcoin we're
[17:07] going to put it on our books and then
[17:10] that just sends the demand for Bitcoin
[17:12] through the
[17:13] roof will those those uh growth charts
[17:17] of the base money uh break at some point
[17:20] when there is just like the event of of
[17:23] hyperinflation the event of like oh we
[17:25] we we hit that Sly point in in just
[17:28] debasing
[17:29] money yeah um it's a good question uh no
[17:34] one that I have heard of or read of has
[17:38] been ever able to actually predict a
[17:41] hyperinflation okay I mean
[17:44] hyperinflation happen all the time uh
[17:46] they happened here where I am in the
[17:47] former Soviet Union in the early
[17:49] 90s uh they happened uh you know
[17:53] happening in Argentina right now
[17:55] although they're kind of settling that
[17:56] down you know Zimbabwe goes through
[17:57] these bouts uh so so they can happen
[18:00] people can recognize them and they try
[18:01] to get into more harder currencies or
[18:04] Bitcoin but I've never you know I've
[18:07] read Steve hanky and some of these
[18:08] economists that talk about this a lot
[18:10] I've never seen like an indicator that
[18:12] can sort of predict when the next
[18:14] hyperinflation could come but you know
[18:18] doesn't look great for for uh all the
[18:21] currencies together and go back to this
[18:23] chart they continue to you know to grow
[18:27] at this 12.7 % per year uh but you know
[18:33] also like this was really high here in
[18:35] 20 uh excuse me in 2011 2012 and then
[18:38] also during covid so this is like these
[18:41] qe1 2 and three happened here after
[18:43] global financial crisis and then during
[18:44] Co you can see these are up towards the
[18:46] upper bound that means it's like really
[18:47] excess Printing and now you know now
[18:50] it's back down so things can go on a lot
[18:53] longer it's like the Cane's quote right
[18:54] markets can be more irrational for
[18:56] longer than you have capital
[18:59] so uh that's why Bitcoin is a great safe
[19:02] haven right it's just a great place to
[19:04] escape from all this noise all of these
[19:08] uh crazy figures and uh you know have a
[19:11] beer or something and is is that growth
[19:15] of as you showed before with the Bitcoin
[19:17] price and the monetary uh price is is
[19:20] that like really correlating where like
[19:22] when when they print a lot of money the
[19:25] the price is actually moving is is that
[19:27] uh really a good correlation from last
[19:31] yeah we talked about that actually I
[19:33] mentioned just briefly from last uh Peak
[19:35] it did I need to uh update a chart I
[19:40] don't have it for you unfortunately
[19:41] right now but if you can imagine like
[19:43] you just look at this chart right we we
[19:44] know that this this big bump happened
[19:46] let me take these off so we see that the
[19:49] big bump happened above Trend here in
[19:50] 2021 which is the fouryear cycle after
[19:53] 2017 and if you just line that up right
[19:56] with this 20 21 here 2022 there was
[20:02] there was a
[20:03] boost um wasn't as much here actually uh
[20:08] it kind of seems like that because we
[20:09] were still high here in all these
[20:12] periods and there was a lot of money
[20:14] printing after the um Global financial
[20:18] crisis but it wasn't exactly you see
[20:20] it's kind of pulling down here and also
[20:22] the Federal Reserve you know the the
[20:24] dollar the the biggest Central Bank uh
[20:27] essentially the biggest you know world
[20:28] Reserve currency Central Bank they
[20:30] weren't printing money since 2014
[20:32] actually um
[20:35] so the point is long round about way of
[20:39] saying we we saw it we saw it in the
[20:41] last cycle and if we see it again it's
[20:43] more confirmation that Bitcoin actually
[20:45] might line up
[20:47] with with uh the rest of the banking
[20:51] system being unsustainable to not you
[20:54] know you saw that pal just dropped uh
[20:57] the FED funds uh 50 basis points a
[20:59] couple weeks
[21:00] ago you know it's not that high it was
[21:03] only 5 a half% now down to five it's
[21:05] really not that much compared to
[21:07] historical values you know it's been up
[21:08] to 20% before in the 80s and that's like
[21:12] been too much too much pain stock
[21:13] markets at alltime high and you know
[21:15] that's gas to the fire like they're
[21:17] going to have to buy more assets if they
[21:18] want to keep these interest rates coming
[21:20] lower
[21:21] and if they do that then again Bitcoin
[21:25] might line up perfectly in the next
[21:26] cycle 2024 2025 where it's precisely
[21:30] like you are asking they're printing
[21:33] more and bitcoin's screaming higher
[21:35] because of that it's interesting because
[21:38] a lot of people um that are right now
[21:40] not in Bitcoin but a little bit outside
[21:42] of Bitcoin and have interest in Bitcoin
[21:44] they they hear that like oh Bitcoin is
[21:46] an inflation hatch and then they're like
[21:48] oh yeah the inflation went up this month
[21:50] but Bitcoin went down this month uh
[21:53] which is always funny for me because the
[21:55] those uh things are way more complex
[21:58] than just like looking at an inflation
[21:59] number and looking then at the Bitcoin
[22:01] price but this could be like more um
[22:04] real world data and and and confirmation
[22:08] that it actually has an a direct
[22:11] correlation between that and this
[22:13] inflation hge is not just a narrative
[22:16] but actually like with data backed up
[22:18] and like oh that actually is an
[22:20] inflation hasch see here there's money
[22:22] printing going on and the Bitcoin pricee
[22:24] actually reacts to that yeah precisely
[22:27] and I I never use inflation I'm sure I'm
[22:29] going to uh come back at that someday
[22:32] just to show some point but I've I've
[22:34] never for all my charts and started
[22:36] doing YouTube videos last year I just
[22:38] like you said it's too complicated uh
[22:40] people argue that it's biased the
[22:42] inflation indices CPI
[22:44] PPI uh there's no skin in the game there
[22:47] right I mean if they you know if they
[22:48] want for Social Security in the US for
[22:50] example if they want it to be a little
[22:52] bit lower so they don't have to adjust
[22:55] the cost of living they they put it
[22:56] lower and generally they want to make it
[22:57] seem like prices are going lower than
[22:59] they are so that's why I definitely try
[23:01] to look at things from the supply side
[23:03] let's make the Judgment first what's
[23:04] happening on the supply side and then we
[23:06] can maybe infer what's happening on the
[23:09] uh on the demand side is that the the
[23:12] the most interesting chart that you're
[23:14] currently looking at is is like is the
[23:16] is that the the most interesting metric
[23:18] that you you're looking or what is from
[23:21] you the most interesting chart to that
[23:23] you look the most on uh I got a couple I
[23:26] mean here is an interesting one um this
[23:28] is the US Federal uh debt and
[23:34] it's it's let's just clear it up here
[23:36] for you this is US federal debt
[23:39] total uh all the way back to the to the
[23:42] signing of the Constitution
[23:44] 1780s and you
[23:47] know us even Andrew Jackson got the debt
[23:51] down to zero although he was not very
[23:52] good to the Native Americans so you know
[23:54] it's it's never easy in politics right
[23:56] and um the Civil War happened here here
[23:58] exploded the national debt uh but if you
[24:02] look at all these curves on linear scale
[24:03] they always just fly up to the right and
[24:06] it's just like all always how it looks
[24:08] like really what you're looking at you
[24:09] see World War II national debt spikes up
[24:12] right still you're talking like millions
[24:14] and billions of dollars here and now all
[24:17] of a sudden we're at
[24:19] trillions uh September month end 35.4
[24:23] trillion dollar of US debt okay this is
[24:26] publicly tradable debt right these are
[24:28] bonds and um Central Bank owns a
[24:33] significant portion of that okay and uh
[24:37] I I show that here so this green it's
[24:40] very similar to the monetary base that I
[24:42] talked about but this is the asset side
[24:45] of this of just the FED right not the
[24:46] whole world as I showed you in that
[24:49] other um slide and so just the Federal
[24:52] Reserve and just their treasury Holdings
[24:53] which is basically the whole balance
[24:54] sheet they got up to $8.5 trillion at
[24:58] the peak of covid when the uh total debt
[25:01] was 30.5 trillion so if you do a ratio
[25:04] of that it's 30% almost it's a huge
[25:08] number 28% it Peak that and you know
[25:13] that means 30 cents out of every dollar
[25:15] was basically printed at this point uh
[25:18] by the central bank and that
[25:21] is a record if I reset the zoom can see
[25:25] the only time it was a really big peak
[25:27] before
[25:28] the modern times before Global financial
[25:30] crisis was during Vietnam so you see
[25:33] here Vietnam uh it ended for the United
[25:35] States in
[25:37] 1975 and uh it only goes down because
[25:42] the US actually prints more debt it's
[25:44] sorry uh issues more debt but the
[25:45] Federal Reserve doesn't buy more debt so
[25:48] that was like 15 uh 18% it peaked out
[25:52] here in 1975 and we've gone all the way
[25:55] up to 30% now what happens in
[25:58] hyperinflationary economies well this is
[26:00] basically the central bank's going to
[26:01] buy all the debt because no one wants to
[26:02] hold the debt no one wants to hold the
[26:03] money so it's a very like Vicious Circle
[26:07] type of a thing now they've been still
[26:09] been trying to normalize it as they say
[26:12] you can see these lines here this qe1
[26:13] two and
[26:14] three uh from the global financial
[26:17] crisis and then Co just massive amounts
[26:18] of money printing buying the debt now
[26:20] they're trying to normalize so now it's
[26:22] down to about
[26:24] 18.8% uh but like we just talked about
[26:28] they have declared that they're going to
[26:31] start uh they're going to start dropping
[26:35] interest rates which means buying more
[26:37] assets printing money to buy more Assets
[26:40] in the future and I expect this if they
[26:43] want to keep these interest rates lower
[26:44] for longer you're going to you're going
[26:46] to see this number turn around soon
[26:49] enough so uh again it's gasoline on the
[26:53] fire for a hard asset like Bitcoin which
[26:56] can't be debased in that manner
[26:58] and I also don't um I don't say any of
[27:01] this stuff like with particularly Glee
[27:03] you know you got a lot of bitcoiners who
[27:04] want who want the sort of the world to
[27:06] burn for Bitcoin to fly obviously don't
[27:08] want that to happen and I don't
[27:10] necessarily think that's going to happen
[27:13] um I think it's going to they're going
[27:15] to try to manage this the best they can
[27:18] and uh they're learning from things that
[27:21] you know quote unquote learning they
[27:23] they're learning from things in the past
[27:26] and in the Central Bankers opinion it's
[27:30] more liquidity
[27:32] will solve and Stave off these hard
[27:35] Landings of course you and I I'm sure
[27:36] don't agree with that it's because you
[27:38] know that's just kicking the can down
[27:39] the road making things worse later on
[27:42] but that's really the only tool that
[27:43] they have and they're going to continue
[27:45] to do that so again like I said five and
[27:46] a half percent was too hot it's too hard
[27:49] for uh for a lot of people in the
[27:51] economy right now so that's why they've
[27:53] decided to drop rates and once they do
[27:55] that you're going to see more money
[27:56] printing is relation to to how they are
[28:00] buying uh gold or how much gold the the
[28:03] central banks are are
[28:04] holding uh other countries in the
[28:09] world uh are increasing a little bit but
[28:12] it's not much honestly in the grand
[28:15] scheme uh don't have a chart for that at
[28:18] the moment I can just unshare my screen
[28:21] here but the Federal Reserve hasn't
[28:22] changed its gold Holdings in
[28:25] like 20 years something like this I mean
[28:28] it's w yeah and it's very small amount
[28:31] you know that figure that I just showed
[28:33] you uh the treasuries were $8.5 trillion
[28:37] dollar of assets the total balance sheet
[28:40] the total assets are 9 trillion so
[28:41] there's something like 500 billion there
[28:43] and that's mostly the difference is
[28:44] corporations they hold some corporate
[28:45] debt uh it's like a it's like a nominal
[28:48] value of gold for the United States very
[28:50] small um and people even wonder if it's
[28:53] even there because Allan greens ban the
[28:56] former fed of the former uh chairman of
[28:58] the FED in the 90s made this statement
[29:00] that central banks stand by ready to
[29:03] sell gold should the price rise this is
[29:06] a very uh monopolistic statement
[29:09] basically saying uh we have a lot of
[29:12] gold we don't like it when gold
[29:14] outshines the dollar so we're going to
[29:16] sell our gold to suppress the gold price
[29:20] should the price rise he actually said
[29:21] it like it's in writing you can see it
[29:23] in the minutes the quote is there um you
[29:27] know there's a lot of iracy theories
[29:28] about this like people say that they
[29:29] sold too much and now they don't have it
[29:31] and they're just saying that they're
[29:33] they're recording the asset on their
[29:35] books so it is an asset say gold the
[29:36] gold account they're recording it like
[29:39] it like it's there but really it's it's
[29:40] all been leased out to the different
[29:42] banks and and sold and uh they just have
[29:45] a receivable now like they don't
[29:46] actually have the gold sitting in the
[29:48] vault that's a whole another conspiracy
[29:49] theory but that's just the US it is true
[29:52] China uh is buying some more gold uh but
[29:55] even there it's it's actually a much
[29:57] smaller proportion of their balance
[29:59] sheet than holding these bonds these uh
[30:03] treasury bonds European bonds Japanese
[30:06] government bonds if you watch or listen
[30:08] to my podcast on a regular basis I'll

[31:22] not least I have something completely
[31:24] new for you guys I partnered up with
[31:28] coin vigilante this is the most
[31:30] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:33] saw created by anyone look at that
[31:36] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[31:38] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[31:42] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[31:45] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[31:47] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[31:51] coin viilante just dropped a completely
[31:54] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[31:57] one watch collections you have the date
[32:00] of the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:03] there and of course also the block
[32:05] height and which EPO we are currently in
[32:09] I love the level of detail they put in
[32:11] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[32:14] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[32:17] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[32:19] love those watches so so much it's
[32:22] interesting for me when I look it's it
[32:25] seems like the biggest fear that Bitcoin
[32:27] is could have is uh that all those
[32:30] governments and central banks all of the
[32:32] sudden uh act in a rational way and not
[32:35] print anymore but that would probably
[32:38] just not work like like the the point of
[32:41] of that even being a possibility seems
[32:43] to be already vanished for for for me
[32:47] right or or is that still is that still
[32:49] a possibility that governments actually
[32:51] can reverse that that Trend that is
[32:54] going on for for so long let me show you
[32:58] this picture so here's uh similar to
[33:01] what I just talked about uh this is now
[33:03] showing you the balance sheet of both
[33:04] sides so assets always equal liabilities
[33:06] just the accounting identity um on the
[33:11] asset side we talked about is the bonds
[33:12] on the liability side this is actually
[33:14] this base money I was talking about so
[33:16] let's just look before the global
[33:17] financial crisis in the US let's go from
[33:20] Back to the even start of the Vietnam
[33:22] War on the top you have the
[33:26] treasuries that the United States
[33:28] Federal Reserve has held okay and as I
[33:30] said right around here in the 70s this
[33:32] was 15% of the total debt 18% of the
[33:35] total debt uh of the United States the
[33:37] Federal Reserve itself owned and how did
[33:39] they buy that money they bought it with
[33:42] their liabilities which is in this black
[33:44] portion and the black is actually
[33:47] physical currency so this is right here
[33:49] is like literally how the sausage is
[33:51] made when people talk about the printing
[33:52] press and all central banks do is print
[33:55] and like you said it's just a it's a
[33:56] trend and and it is indeed what they do
[34:00] I mean you can very rarely see that the
[34:02] black we're not even talking about the
[34:03] Bank Reserves yet but the black portion
[34:05] of this chart goes down you can see here
[34:08] in there's a little bit of a bump here
[34:10] in December 1999 then it goes down what
[34:12] was that that was actually
[34:14] Y2K um when Y2K happened a lot of people
[34:17] got scared people take money out of the
[34:19] bank and the Federal Reserve had to
[34:21] print extra cash there that they thought
[34:23] okay actually we're going to reain this
[34:25] in so they destroyed some cash in the
[34:27] year 2000 when things were fine but it's
[34:30] like a such a small thing compared to
[34:32] what typically happens again just
[34:33] looking over this sort of post World War
[34:36] II period up until the global financial
[34:38] crisis they're always printing money and
[34:40] and and that's literally how they bought
[34:42] the bonds typically they would print the
[34:44] cash this is physical cash there was
[34:47] there's 12 federal reserve banks in the
[34:49] US they take the cash on pallets they
[34:51] deliver them to Banks but the banks
[34:53] don't just like get the money for free
[34:55] they're like what do I got to do to take
[34:56] this cash like well give some of the
[34:58] government bonds that you bought in the
[34:59] market we're going to we're going to
[35:00] take it on our books now and that's what
[35:02] happens that's how money comes into
[35:04] existence and um
[35:07] so I'm just trying to affirm basically
[35:10] with your your thesis it always goes up
[35:12] they always you know the demand for cash
[35:16] generally goes up and you can see in the
[35:18] black there it's always gone up even
[35:20] during Co when a little bit more now
[35:22] this what's this dark green area on the
[35:24] bottom that's the bank reserve portion
[35:26] so um this is what I've talked about and
[35:29] you know this is it basically just
[35:31] mirrors the other side there's some
[35:32] other stuff going on we don't have to
[35:33] talk about during the show but
[35:35] um you'll notice that the negative
[35:37] monetary base doesn't it's a bit less
[35:40] than the total treasuries but
[35:44] uh this is this is what they do this is
[35:46] what they do they just print the money
[35:48] to bring it into existence and very
[35:50] rarely like here notice how I said
[35:52] before the US hasn't printed money since
[35:53] 2014 so this is this is true the
[35:56] treasuries were flat they weren't buying
[35:58] any more treasuries and the monetary
[36:00] base on the bottom there is flat it was
[36:03] uh about negative not negative it's just
[36:06] on the negative axis there it was $3.8
[36:08] trillion and by 2019 end it was $3.2
[36:12] trillion so this was a little bit of a
[36:14] destruction of money but mostly it was a
[36:16] destruction of those Bank Reserves as I
[36:18] talked about at the beginning of the
[36:19] show The the account that each bank has
[36:22] and then of course Co happened they need
[36:23] an excuse they need to print money again
[36:25] and off you go so
[36:28] uh again a long- winded way of I think
[36:31] answering your question that usually
[36:33] they uh they print and actually one more
[36:35] thing just to go back to the beginning
[36:36] here notice a discrepancy here in the
[36:39] United States's case before World War II
[36:42] so before World War II you see that
[36:44] these treasury value this treasury value
[36:46] is much lower than the monetary base see
[36:49] the monetary base is like five six
[36:51] billion here in the
[36:52] 20s um you know whatever you can say 16
[36:55] bli I'll take out the physical currency
[36:56] just so you see what I'm talking about
[36:57] the dark green at the bottom it's you
[37:00] see it's 17 billion in the 19 like the
[37:02] eve of World War II for the us but they
[37:04] only owed they only owned two billion of
[37:07] treasuries this is Central Bank of
[37:09] course everything changed here uh when
[37:12] the US got into World War II and and we
[37:15] also went the BR and woods conference
[37:16] with the new dollar gold standard but
[37:18] here what was mostly the asset on the
[37:20] book of the Federal Reserve at this time
[37:22] it was gold it was gold actually so I'm
[37:25] not showing it but the gap here between
[37:28] how much money they were Printing and
[37:30] then the asset side which you can't see
[37:32] you see very little treasuries here uh
[37:35] the assets were filled up primarily by
[37:37] gold and also some corporate bonds
[37:39] because there actually were more
[37:42] buying uh you know lending money to
[37:44] companies and Banks not not not the not
[37:47] the government in the early days so it
[37:50] shows you how things change and now it's
[37:52] just like all they do is buy government
[37:54] bonds
[37:57] they they simplified it yeah just what
[38:02] do you think uh because um I I guess
[38:07] you're the opinion that we at some point
[38:09] uh at a Bitcoin standard where we don't
[38:12] have the fat money or do you think Fiat
[38:14] money will will always
[38:16] exist yeah another good question big
[38:18] picture question uh I think about it
[38:22] often and I think that at the end of the
[38:26] day
[38:28] it's going to be a question of how
[38:31] strong uh these liberal democracies and
[38:35] I I I'm not I really do believe that you
[38:38] know I live here in Eastern Europe so
[38:39] we're we're at risk of war with uh with
[38:41] Russia all the time like Ukraine is and
[38:45] um obviously the world is sliding back
[38:47] into authoritarianism it's really bad
[38:50] it's it's it's tough times
[38:52] but uh still the strongest thing that a
[38:56] liberal democracy has is the value of
[38:59] its currency as you can see here and
[39:01] they you know they do their best to
[39:03] destroy it with more government programs
[39:04] and more spending and it's not good it's
[39:06] not it's definitely not good it's why we
[39:08] want to get into
[39:10] Bitcoin but as long as they can keep
[39:14] that uh
[39:17] position relatively strong and you know
[39:20] you have open markets and you have
[39:22] private property and you have these
[39:23] things that I think that the currency
[39:25] will will stick around
[39:28] and I certainly think it's going to
[39:30] stick around for a couple more
[39:31] Generations you know like I said uh
[39:33] based on these projections that I made
[39:35] in uh this chart
[39:38] here you know there's nothing here that
[39:41] shows me in this chart like this is a
[39:43] huge a huge R squar like this chart is
[39:46] just
[39:47] growing very systematically at this 12
[39:51] and a half% growth rate a year as long
[39:54] as you know and even autocracy by the
[39:57] way they want their currency to print
[40:00] more money and steal stuff as well which
[40:01] autocracies do and I I know that like
[40:04] sarcastic Libertarians listening to this
[40:05] will think that all governments steal
[40:07] you know I understand those those
[40:08] arguments
[40:10] but they're they're going to hold on to
[40:12] their currency as long as they can and
[40:15] um I think that the transition will
[40:20] occur when as already happened with you
[40:23] know Al Salvador and some Nations when
[40:26] they start taking big Bitcoin on as a
[40:28] reserve asset as a treasury instead of
[40:30] holding those bonds those treasury bonds
[40:32] that hold more
[40:33] Bitcoin that will add to the uh that
[40:37] hyperbitcoinization and that will add to
[40:39] that sort of Base money situation being
[40:42] represented by Bitcoin but even in that
[40:45] case I still think they're going to want
[40:46] to hold on to the dollar you know and uh
[40:50] or the Euro and so even if they hold you
[40:53] know 20% of their assets in
[40:55] Bitcoin they're still going to want to
[40:57] do what they can with with the Euro
[40:59] regulate it tax it all the rest and
[41:02] unless we get into some anarch
[41:03] capitalist Paradise which I don't see
[41:06] happening anytime soon um I think the
[41:09] best the best case is that they just
[41:10] start reserving
[41:12] Bitcoin what do you think will happen
[41:14] with with with all that Dept it's it's
[41:17] it's really interesting for me to see
[41:18] like there's a a huge um depth uh in in
[41:23] all the countes basically uh it's just
[41:25] increasing it's just like it's just
[41:27] going going up in in in every year on a
[41:30] bigger Trend at least uh and then at
[41:32] some point they just like find a new
[41:35] currency so like the the unit is then
[41:38] again Lower so because people don't want
[41:40] to buy with like 200 Euros just like one
[41:43] I want maybe like one EUR for that so
[41:46] they have to invent new currencies what
[41:48] do you think will will happen at some
[41:50] point with the I just like in that uh
[41:52] loop where we uh create a new fear
[41:55] currency all 25 to 50
[41:58] years yeah it's another interesting
[42:00] question you know Japan uh actually has
[42:03] a totally different culture with this uh
[42:06] they expunge debt a lot they haven't
[42:09] necessarily expunged the the government
[42:11] debt that foreigners hold Japanese
[42:13] government bonds but internally they
[42:16] expunge debt very much more uh easily
[42:19] than the West does the it's very the
[42:21] West doesn't do it as much uh the United
[42:24] States doesn't do it as much it's it's
[42:26] kept it all on its books and the United
[42:28] States does kind of as you're alluding
[42:29] to this soft soft default they just roll
[42:32] it over extend it if they don't have the
[42:35] taxes to pay it down they print more
[42:37] which is every year they never have
[42:38] enough ta you they don't balance the
[42:39] budget so you know the debt is simply an
[42:42] increase of more deficits a deficit is
[42:43] your negative spending per year and so
[42:46] that they don't it always
[42:49] increases um it gets back to this point
[42:52] of you know a question of what's the
[42:53] breaking point I think it's a there's a
[42:55] multitude of factors there
[42:59] um weirdly and scarily I think probably
[43:02] war is a part of this you know we're
[43:04] seeing a more militant World more armed
[43:06] world and um that might play a factor
[43:10] you know who's the winner who's the
[43:11] losers in certain these certain
[43:13] scenarios here but
[43:17] um it has occurred often in the past and
[43:21] I of the past I mean like the past few
[43:24] Millennia that that that it does become
[43:27] unsustainable unmanageable and they do
[43:29] have these debt jubilees uh that's an
[43:32] idea uh I don't know enough about them
[43:35] to know like the regularity or if that
[43:38] could happen or how good of an idea that
[43:39] is or what that means for the dollar but
[43:43] they certainly happen and like you said
[43:44] as well about the extra currencies
[43:47] actually in this uh chart that I'm
[43:49] showing you here you take the the trend
[43:52] lines off you know like here in the in
[43:54] the 80s and the 70s I am including two
[43:57] countries in particular in Latin America
[43:59] that always done this is Brazil and
[44:01] Argentina they've gone through like six
[44:03] currencies each six or seven each in the
[44:07] last 50 years and that's
[44:09] included uh you know the dollar value
[44:13] you know if you look at it in the native
[44:15] unit you know it like flies up right but
[44:18] the dollar value is roughly the same and
[44:20] it just resets and it's the same it's
[44:22] pretty funny so so the dollar is our
[44:24] numer rare here and it's uh it's a hard
[44:27] concept to sort of understand sometimes
[44:30] because that would be I guess the real X
[44:33] Factor is if people completely you know
[44:35] lose faith in the dollar uh because that
[44:38] has been our numer rare since World War
[44:40] II and you know again not not a scenario
[44:44] I'm necessarily hoping for I think that
[44:46] would be probably a lot of chaos and and
[44:48] difficulties but uh again the best way
[44:50] to prevent your own personal or family
[44:54] finances to falling in that trap as as
[44:57] obviously you and I know is just to buy
[44:58] a little Bitcoin it's
[45:00] a it's a it's a big protection against
[45:03] that yeah it's interesting when you look
[45:05] at like countries where there is a lot
[45:08] of inflation uh like turkey Argentina
[45:11] and and all those countries they mostly
[45:14] use uh US dollar or some some like a a
[45:19] better fiat currency than they have on
[45:21] on their own and they don't flee in in
[45:24] in masses to to bitcoin even though in
[45:26] those countries usually Bitcoin adoption
[45:28] is higher than than in other ones uh but
[45:32] they still like go to the the next best
[45:34] uh broken money and not to the not
[45:37] broken money which is which is an
[45:40] interesting um observation I guess and
[45:44] then like the big question is like what
[45:45] happens if like the the best one the the
[45:48] the seemingly at least least broken one
[45:51] with the USD um what happens if that
[45:54] actually has like an hyperinflation of
[45:56] like 100 200% a year or maybe even like
[46:00] a month or something like that like
[46:01] really crazy numbers then it's like oh
[46:03] people will flee to the gold Bitcoin and
[46:06] all all those things that that could be
[46:08] an that could be a crazy and probably
[46:11] also very scary uh time for even for
[46:16] bitcoiners I think because uh there's so
[46:18] much uncertainty and we we know like how
[46:20] many bitcoiners are your in your bigger
[46:22] family uh you're most likely one a few
[46:25] and and not everyone adops is I try to
[46:28] keep get everyone in board
[46:30] but mostly you're the the only bitcoiner
[46:33] in like bigger family so it will it will
[46:36] be an interesting point and I'm always
[46:38] curious how how this will play out and I
[46:41] think you are one of the best guests for
[46:42] for
[46:43] that no I mean I agree I agree it's um
[46:47] it's anything can happen it's anyone's
[46:48] guess there and how those sort of uh the
[46:51] crack up boom as it's called that's how
[46:53] me's referred to it um you know I what I
[46:57] say is if you look at some other
[46:58] indicators it still simply just currency
[47:02] exchange rates still seems that the
[47:04] dollar is this uh it's the best looking
[47:06] horse in the glue factory as I like to
[47:08] say so the uh you know the there it it
[47:10] seems like actually let me show you one
[47:13] more time actually it seems like in this
[47:18] chart
[47:20] uh am I on log let me take it off
[47:24] log all right so it seems in this chart
[47:27] right we're at 30 trillion in December
[47:30] 2021 and then in June 2024 it's down to
[47:32] 26.12 trillion so it seems like actually
[47:35] four trillion was removed from the
[47:38] system as I said they can destroy money
[47:40] right and make the currency stronger but
[47:42] actually What's Happening Here is there
[47:45] some did some went down a little bit but
[47:47] really what's happening is more this is
[47:50] again it's a wienstein ruler thing it's
[47:52] like the numer rare thing what's really
[47:54] happening more than central banks
[47:56] decreasing the the currencies is that
[48:00] the value of their currency in dollar
[48:02] terms is
[48:04] falling that's more of what's happening
[48:07] there than they're decreasing the value
[48:10] of their currencies in circulation and
[48:12] you just sort of have
[48:13] to have to um take my word on that for
[48:18] now I have another chart you can find on
[48:19] my YouTube video about or YouTube
[48:21] channel about these things but
[48:23] uh it's it's it's it's uh it's more the
[48:27] case that the that this decrease in this
[48:29] green is not because they're trying to
[48:31] shore up the currency it's more that the
[48:33] value of those currencies you know like
[48:35] the uh the Yen or the Euro or you know
[48:39] the Brazilian rayi or the Indian rupe is
[48:41] just falling in value against the dollar
[48:44] so that's why it looks lower it looks
[48:46] lower than uh it would be if you could
[48:48] look at all 50 of these currency there's
[48:50] 50 currencies in here if you could look
[48:51] at them all in Native terms like you
[48:54] would still see them kind of flat or
[48:56] even Rising a little bit still
[48:59] still okay it's just the dollar amount
[49:02] uh what they actually worth is going
[49:04] down and not the the the units the units
[49:07] of units of it yeah makes sense a lot um
[49:10] now we let's come to uh more of like the
[49:15] the the positive side of it and and
[49:17] adopting and and C how do you see it
[49:20] currently is is the US uh the the
[49:24] fastest horse right now of the big
[49:25] countries obviously like there's El
[49:27] Salvador there's Budan uh but they are
[49:29] quite small compared to the the really
[49:32] big players like Europe like us like
[49:36] China like India like all those bigger
[49:39] uh players uh El Salvador and and and
[49:42] Budan I think salador is a little
[49:44] smaller than Austria I think Austria
[49:46] would be an amazing country for a
[49:47] Bitcoin standard if a economics I would
[49:49] love that but I don't see it anytime
[49:51] soon uh do you see the US in in the lead
[49:55] right now uh I don't know to be honest I
[49:58] don't know I I haven't uh it's harder to
[50:00] check the pulse on those things rather
[50:02] than seeing you know what they're doing
[50:05] um you know you have also the cbdc thing
[50:09] which by the way those charts that I
[50:11] just showed you uh that that that is
[50:12] analogous to cbdcs as well so this told
[50:15] you about the physical currency told you
[50:17] about the Bank Reserves there's there
[50:18] will be a third component of this
[50:20] government-based money that's going to
[50:21] come it's a complete lar on bitcoin and
[50:24] that is the
[50:25] cbdc so you know China has a little bit
[50:27] they're very small right now like some
[50:29] of them are even included in that chart
[50:31] I showed you like with China and stuff
[50:32] it's like extremely small figures pilot
[50:35] projects mostly they're going to they're
[50:37] going to run with that that's something
[50:38] we haven't really talked about but
[50:39] they're going to run with that for a
[50:40] while and they're going to see if the
[50:43] adoption there can help or people use it
[50:45] more conveniently than they would you
[50:47] know another digital currency like
[50:49] Bitcoin or stable coin I think I think
[50:51] that that's it's it's going to take some
[50:53] time to work through there and uh you
[50:55] know the US is talking about maybe
[50:56] stable coins uh being a a bucket of
[51:00] demand value that can buy up you know
[51:02] sop up these extra treasuries and that's
[51:04] true it can be but that's still so again
[51:08] these are so small figures compared to
[51:11] first of all compared to bitcoin and
[51:12] second of all compared to the debt
[51:15] um you know the United States debt as I
[51:17] just showed you 35 what's the value of
[51:20] you know tether it's like 100 billion
[51:23] 115 billion I mean this no way that the
[51:28] tether investors are going to save the
[51:30] dollar you know and say so so in in
[51:33] those for those examples I think that
[51:35] again these are more headwinds against
[51:37] the fiat currency system and they're
[51:39] more Tailwinds for Bitcoin so yeah I do
[51:42] think that uh you know there's some
[51:46] possibility that these things could be
[51:47] added to a reserve asset uh but again I
[51:51] I I don't see it in the next for the
[51:52] next two cycles to be honest how big is
[51:55] actually how big is actually Bitcoin
[51:58] already compared to the to the other
[52:00] currencies obviously smaller than the us
[52:03] but is is it like uh on the ranking side
[52:06] I think like rank five or six or
[52:09] something like that what I yeah if you
[52:11] took out gold just because gold is
[52:14] included in my list but if you took out
[52:16] gold it's number five it has passed uh
[52:21] the bank of England's balance sheet and
[52:23] it did that in February of this year so
[52:26] you have
[52:27] the dollar you have the Euro you have
[52:29] the Yen you have the Yuan Chinese Yuan
[52:31] those big four currencies and then after
[52:34] that you have now Bitcoin at 1.2
[52:37] trillion uh that is that is bigger the
[52:40] the the UK balance sheet uh is about a
[52:42] trillion uh Sterling trillion pound
[52:45] sterling and it it's uh it's actually
[52:49] right at it right now with this little
[52:50] dip in Bitcoin but at you know at 62
[52:52] $63,000 Bitcoin 65 it's fir it's firmly
[52:56] above it
[52:57] um just depends on the exchange rate at
[52:59] the moment but it's it's uh it's broken
[53:02] above it so again more more reason to
[53:05] believe that people are finding Bitcoin
[53:07] as this hard money asset as opposed to
[53:11] any other asset out there or real estate
[53:13] like you said it's kind of crazy when
[53:15] you think about it like uh if if you
[53:18] think about Bitcoin as a nation uh and a
[53:21] nation that just was founded like 15
[53:22] years ago and it's already like the
[53:24] fifth strongest uh financial asset that
[53:28] that's kind of kind of really uh crazy
[53:32] to think about that with with like yes
[53:35] like companies also have been shut up to
[53:38] uh like uh really big um valuations but
[53:42] uh they have marketing team they have
[53:45] some products that they sell to to to
[53:47] customers and stuff like that um Bitcoin
[53:50] is completely voluntary there nobody's
[53:53] forcing anyone to adopt Bitcoin in the
[53:55] other thing is actually true like people
[53:58] actually trying really hard that people
[54:00] not get into Bitcoin like most of them
[54:02] and they really big campaigns against it
[54:05] that are funded really nicely also uh
[54:08] it's kind of fascinating that that we
[54:09] are already at this point just after
[54:11] like yeah decade basically of the
[54:15] discovery absolutely incredible yeah in
[54:18] 15 years that it's the number five
[54:20] currency and then if you if you uh lob
[54:23] in gold which is about it's up to about
[54:26] 15 really now cuz gold has had a big run
[54:27] this year it's about $2,600 an ounce and
[54:30] if you do the math on all that the the
[54:32] oun is outstanding uh that are
[54:34] non-industrial gold you get something
[54:35] like a $15 trillion dollar
[54:38] valuation uh again that's a very loose
[54:40] number and you know you have gold that's
[54:42] in jewelry gold is in central banks you
[54:44] have gold is in private Banks but that
[54:46] would be in my view that's the big
[54:48] that's the big one that
[54:49] really it's going to be interesting to
[54:51] see if Bitcoin ever takes if gold just
[54:53] completely reverts to like a a jewelry
[54:56] sort of thing and like it's has no you
[54:59] know people are like wondering why why
[55:01] do we have these bars you know really
[55:02] like Warren Buffett used to joke I mean
[55:04] Warren Buffett hates Bitcoin as well but
[55:05] he hates gold and he used to joke
[55:08] probably still jokes that like why why
[55:09] do we spend resources digging gold out
[55:12] of the ground and then putting it back
[55:14] in the ground in a vault in a central
[55:15] bank like what's the point and uh he's
[55:19] right to some extent it is true that if
[55:21] you huddle an asset like even gold
[55:24] you're not adding economic value you're
[55:25] just preserving yourself against a
[55:28] destruction of a possible other asset
[55:30] which your wealth can be denominated in
[55:33] you know another unit of account so that
[55:35] that's all that you're doing if you
[55:36] huddle it's true with Bitcoin by the way
[55:38] uh you do need to lend it out to get it
[55:40] into the economy of course they go crazy
[55:42] with their lending as we talked about
[55:44] but uh you know so there's a lot of
[55:46] pushpull there it's going to take time
[55:48] you work it out and um you know I I
[55:52] think there's there's a lot of Tailwinds
[55:54] for for Bitcoin like we said at the top
[55:56] of the show especially if if they're
[55:58] going to keep these rates lower for
[55:59] longer now and and and start this
[56:01] sustain push to print a little bit more
[56:03] money that's that lines up right again
[56:05] with the fouryear
[56:06] cycle yeah but I think the the that
[56:09] value proposition of of holding
[56:12] something that holds your own Financial
[56:14] energy I mean that's that's kind of the
[56:16] biggest Market ever that's the biggest
[56:19] biggest problem uh you can solve for
[56:22] someone like you you work for something
[56:24] and you get energy from that like
[56:26] however
[56:26] you get energy from the financial energy
[56:29] uh that that saving into the future uh
[56:32] that's like the the biggest biggest
[56:34] thing ever you you you brought up uh
[56:37] lending and and borrowing do you think
[56:39] that's a good idea to to borrow against
[56:43] your Bitcoin and and and basically maybe
[56:45] even like go short feeld when you when
[56:48] you see all those those charts how do
[56:50] you think about
[56:51] that yeah I mean well never Financial
[56:54] advice let's say that never Financial
[56:56] advice device but uh borrowing against
[56:59] an asset like Bitcoin is in my opinion
[57:02] much better than lending against it I I
[57:03] I would not you know you got to you got
[57:05] to convince me that the interest rate at
[57:06] Bitcoin is pretty high to part with my
[57:09] Bitcoin
[57:10] while you know while the asset could be
[57:13] going up in Big Value in the next year
[57:16] for example right and plus I have the
[57:18] opport the I have the uh possibility
[57:20] that you will not pay me back that
[57:22] you're not going to make good on that
[57:23] Bitcoin right so Lending would be very
[57:27] uh I would in my opinion unadvisable but
[57:29] borrowing against it um you know you
[57:32] know post that is collateral borrow
[57:34] against it buy more Bitcoin never
[57:37] Financial advice but yeah if we're in
[57:38] this uh if we're in this fomo stage for
[57:41] the next year it it actually only makes
[57:44] economic sense to do that um but you got
[57:48] to be careful with that you always got
[57:49] to be careful with leverage because you
[57:50] can get stopped out you can have too
[57:54] much in your interest payments you can't
[57:55] afford so and so forth so yeah that's
[57:57] that yeah I do think so too it's like
[58:01] overall it's a good concept but uh there
[58:03] can be one small detail in in the
[58:06] overall deal that really Burns you down
[58:08] in the in the in in the short to long
[58:10] long run you should always I think um uh
[58:14] I think saor said it in the beginning
[58:15] when in 2021 it was uh really haed where
[58:19] like Bing against the Bitcoin also with
[58:20] Celsius it was a big topic uh back then
[58:24] obviously that didn't turn out good
[58:26] yeah uh but he also said uh like if
[58:29] you're not prepared for Bitcoin to go
[58:31] down 90% And you can still hold it and
[58:34] you're still fine uh you you probably
[58:36] should not do it uh and it's a I think
[58:39] it's a good good way to think about it
[58:41] but in a in a in a general way if we
[58:45] think now of a
[58:47] world very far down the road uh where
[58:51] actually Bitcoin is the base money and
[58:53] we don't have the depth system anymore
[58:56] again very far down the road um what
[58:59] role does dep and lending and borrowing
[59:03] then play if we have money in Bitcoin as
[59:07] something appreciating in value not
[59:09] depreciating and the the kind of the the
[59:12] hurdle rate new hurdle rate is is
[59:14] Bitcoin does that change depth systems
[59:17] where like people just like work for
[59:19] something and don't take tap for it or
[59:22] how does this Al impact like um that
[59:25] that whole thing with dep and maybe like
[59:27] Venture capitalism yeah that's one of
[59:29] the theories uh I'm not as hardcore as
[59:32] some Bitcoin analyst perhaps that think
[59:35] like debt is going to completely go away
[59:37] and you're just going to have such a
[59:39] sound asset that appreciates constantly
[59:41] that you know why would you have any
[59:43] loans I do think that it has been
[59:45] evident even with very stable gold
[59:48] systems that people actually just prefer
[59:52] a little bit more interest and a little
[59:55] bit less safety
[59:56] um now gold is still different granted
[59:59] but you can look back at some of these
[60:00] Free banking systems in Scotland and
[60:03] Canada uh in the 1700s the
[60:06] 1800s um where they didn't have a
[60:08] central bank they didn't have a
[60:09] systemically increasing money supply as
[60:12] we talked about uh already on this show
[60:14] with the Federal Reserves balance sheet
[60:15] as an example or I showed you the 50
[60:18] currencies you still increase credit and
[60:21] actually people wanted to do that how
[60:23] that looks I have no idea right is it uh
[60:26] is it for short-term credit only
[60:28] short-term working capital I don't know
[60:30] but I I do have a hard time believing
[60:34] that if you want to take some future
[60:38] value of the productivity that you hope
[60:41] to deliver to the
[60:42] market by definition that means you're
[60:45] going to need to take you know a loan
[60:47] and of course you're going to have to
[60:49] convince the investors that you can out
[60:51] compete the accreting value of Bitcoin
[60:54] which like as we just talked about
[60:55] that's why I would never own Bitcoin
[60:56] right now because you can't offer me 45%
[60:59] return I wouldn't trust it based on uh
[61:02] how you're going to hold the collateral
[61:03] how safe is the you know how safe is my
[61:05] collateral posted there whatever I'd be
[61:07] happy to do it the other way and borrow
[61:08] against it but but lending I wouldn't so
[61:11] if we do get to that point like you said
[61:13] way down the road where it's it's a calm
[61:16] stable sustainable asset it's truly the
[61:19] risk free asset right like no reason to
[61:21] hold treasuries no reason to hold gold
[61:24] uh you just hold Bitcoin
[61:27] um yeah it's going to be pretty hard to
[61:30] uh beat that return but I still think
[61:33] people are going to try I mean you know
[61:34] it's it's You're simply just borrowing
[61:36] from the future of the productivity that
[61:38] you think you can deliver it's all that
[61:40] you do when you when you take a loan
[61:43] um and I I think that that that process
[61:46] would still would still exist might look
[61:48] very different might be only short term
[61:50] might be in some sort of a factoring
[61:52] arrangement with your you know invoices
[61:55] or whatever but uh I have a hard time
[61:58] believing that it it won't be there H
[62:00] it's a human nature to to to get
[62:03] something from it uh and do something uh
[62:06] more than uh than the average I guess
[62:09] there's always just like uh you want to
[62:11] something more and want to be creative
[62:13] with it will be interesting to see I'm
[62:15] really looking forward to that what do
[62:17] you think is the the the biggest impact
[62:20] that Bitcoin will have on on the world
[62:22] maybe even like shorter term that we can
[62:25] see like maybe already in 10 20 30 years
[62:28] from now sorry repeat the question
[62:29] what's the shorter term yeah what's
[62:31] what's the the biggest impact you think
[62:33] that Bitcoin will have on the world even
[62:35] like shorter term 10 20 years from
[62:37] now well I do think that uh more
[62:41] productive Investments is one I think
[62:44] that less propagate spending is another
[62:48] uh by governments and by you know
[62:51] companies with wild and crazy ideas
[62:53] right and this goes back to exactly the
[62:55] point we were just talking about right
[62:56] you're going to have a a solid risk-free
[62:59] asset that is ACC creating in value
[63:01] while you dear government are offering
[63:04] you know these bonds which you know you
[63:07] cannot even pay back and you spend too
[63:09] much and the programs aren't good those
[63:11] things are there a real challenge to to
[63:14] governments around the world and to
[63:17] companies around the world so I think
[63:19] that that's going to in
[63:21] turn make better uh products and goods
[63:26] and services and better decisions from
[63:28] the people that govern us so I think
[63:31] that that's all great and I think that
[63:34] uh you know the old Bitcoin fixes this
[63:37] saying uh will really apply to a lot of
[63:39] Industries I don't think every industry
[63:41] I don't think you know again not to
[63:43] bring it back too much to the to the
[63:44] military stuff but over here in Eastern
[63:46] Europe like we have been concerned not
[63:48] just since 2022 but for you know for 10
[63:51] years when Russia reinvaded Crimea like
[63:53] this was something in Europe we said
[63:54] never again
[63:56] it's not going to happen again and now
[63:57] it's happening and you know war is
[64:00] politics by other
[64:01] means uh we are now into we're going
[64:04] back into a war cycle of of of economies
[64:08] hopefully not full-blown World War III
[64:09] that would uh never be obviously war is
[64:12] never good and we've already see what
[64:14] happened in the Middle East we see
[64:15] what's happening in Ukraine but every
[64:17] country now in Europe is increasing
[64:19] their spending and this is just
[64:21] something that like Bitcoin has no
[64:23] effect on this it has no effect on this
[64:25] it's it's it's
[64:26] um talk about nuclear proliferation we
[64:29] talk about nuclear risks from Russia
[64:32] talk about what China is doing Bitcoin
[64:34] has a Zero Effect on this that it's it's
[64:36] just a fact uh can say what we want
[64:39] about Austrian economics and freedom and
[64:42] and I love these conversations on a
[64:44] global level like on a on a broad level
[64:46] but um you know you're us is already
[64:51] spending a trillion dollars a year on
[64:53] its military and it's going to increase
[64:55] as is every other country in Europe
[64:57] right now so scary but and I hope that
[65:00] you know cooler heads can Prevail there
[65:01] but I I do think that there are other
[65:03] there certainly are other factors in the
[65:05] world than than Bitcoin and we're we're
[65:08] a long way from like the pure
[65:10] Utopia yeah that's that's that's
[65:13] definitely for sure uh like even if we
[65:16] are coming to where everything is
[65:18] peaceful and and I do hope so but I'm
[65:21] skeptical more and more uh it's it's
[65:24] 100% a very long time
[65:26] uh till then perfect then let's come
[65:28] closer to the end where I asked all my
[65:30] guests the same question um what can we
[65:32] learn from you besides
[65:36] Bitcoin well uh you can learn how
[65:39] wonderful Eastern Europe is come join me
[65:42] in the baltics anytime uh just ping me
[65:45] on Twitter or whatever uh can show you
[65:49] why capitalism is a good thing and
[65:50] communism is a bad thing because uh the
[65:52] bolts are a great example of Breaking
[65:55] Free from the Communist chains that they
[65:58] had for 50 years and are doing
[66:01] everything they possibly can to not have
[66:03] uh be invaded again and uh you know come
