[00:00] i f mode into mstr Yesterday micro
[00:03] strategy is going to be the black hole
[00:05] of the financial markets on Friday micro
[00:07] strategy stock was more traded than
[00:09] Facebook $8 billion of trading strategy
[00:13] outperform Bitcoin but you only get the
[00:15] number Go technology not the freedom gr
[00:17] technology what happens if I get hit by
[00:19] a bus my family maybe doesn't know that
[00:22] I have Bitcoin or doesn't know how to
[00:23] move the
[00:24] coins hello Stefan how are you doing hi
[00:27] Robin I'm really happy to meet you
[00:30] because I'm looking I mean I I don't
[00:32] manage to to see all your podcast
[00:34] because you are doing a lot but it's
[00:38] really interesting to uh to
[00:40] see all the topic you're covering and
[00:43] your style you're really very like
[00:46] you're smooth and uh relaxed and you go
[00:50] deep with your with your uh you know the
[00:54] people you you you you interview so but
[00:57] actually you you do you frequency is
[01:00] like one a day right yes now I have one
[01:03] a day actually today is a weird day
[01:06] because I have three recordings like I
[01:07] have three recordings today uh but
[01:10] usually I have actually just um yeah one
[01:14] a day uh recording One A Day publishing
[01:17] takes a lot of time but it's it's it's
[01:18] it's a really nice thing and you're
[01:20] outside in Italy right yeah yeah yeah
[01:22] now it's good that you were talking you
[01:25] were talking I was not because there's a
[01:27] dog here there's something mowing the LA
[01:30] but now we're going to go into a place
[01:32] which is a bit more
[01:34] silent I like it I never had a podcast
[01:37] where we did it outside I think it's
[01:40] it's it's nice to like change up the
[01:42] environments and see yeah stuff yeah I
[01:45] before I would I would say two things
[01:47] about that one is a little tribute to
[01:49] Steven lupka who loves who who loves to
[01:52] walk like 10 miles a day and the other
[01:55] thing is that it's a little bit to
[01:57] illustrate I it wasn't planned
[02:00] but that
[02:01] uh like Honeybadger doesn't give a
[02:06] dam you know it just you you just do
[02:08] your thing and Do no harm and there you
[02:11] go I just hope that the camera doesn't
[02:13] move too much yeah it's it's good I
[02:16] think and it's it's it's like we're
[02:18] having a video call and we have a like I
[02:21] think it's fine that that format and I
[02:24] I'm I'm already looking forward to the
[02:26] feedback we get from the community that
[02:29] I think I think a change of views a
[02:31] change of scenes is always good yeah
[02:33] yeah but let's start right into the the
[02:35] questions I want to discover today self-
[02:38] custody because you work for the Bitcoin
[02:40] advisory I had I think two podcasts ago
[02:43] I had actually beat the dunworth on uh
[02:45] so it will be published like two or
[02:47] three days before you uh which is also
[02:49] really interesting and uh we also want
[02:53] to cover today what for how much uh for
[02:57] how much Bitcoin you have what self
[02:59] castes solution would be best for you
[03:01] but before I want to get into that topic
[03:04] I saw one tweet of yours that I wanted
[03:06] to cover first uh that you bought micro
[03:09] strategy
[03:10] stocks is that right yeah in fact it I I
[03:15] I wonder I wonder whether it was like
[03:17] the spark that start started the the
[03:19] fire on bitco Twitter because after that
[03:21] it exploded in all directions maybe it
[03:23] was just it could be that it was a
[03:26] coincidence but it's it's not important
[03:28] I just tweeted
[03:30] uh I F mode into mstr yesterday you know
[03:36] just that and it got like 50 comments or
[03:39] something like that which
[03:41] is I felt that it it triggered people a
[03:45] little bit so there were some reactions
[03:48] of yes me too and others you you're
[03:52] gay because because you're not a real
[03:55] play and stuff so at the end for the
[03:59] last 20 4 48
[04:01] hours there's a really interesting
[04:03] discussion going on whereas this is more
[04:06] signal or more noise you know and in the
[04:08] end I think that everybody can do
[04:10] whatever they want again you know and
[04:13] but I really think that mstr inside the
[04:17] financial markets is a different animal
[04:20] in the same way that Bitcoin is a
[04:22] different animal in the asset classes
[04:24] Market I think that micro strategy is
[04:27] going
[04:28] to to be the black hole it has a
[04:32] potential to be the black hole of the
[04:34] financial markets since everything as
[04:37] you know is is
[04:39] denominated in an
[04:41] inferior
[04:43] denomination which is the US dollar or
[04:45] or any other fat currency and the
[04:48] mechanism the genius mechanism of
[04:51] Michael saor which and I'm not going to
[04:54] go too much into the I'm not even able
[04:58] to to describe
[05:00] fully uh what what how he acts but
[05:03] basically he uses number go up
[05:06] technology to have his stock go up and
[05:10] to leverage his stock to buy bone
[05:13] Bitcoin so it's never never ending Loop
[05:18] so I just bought like three
[05:20] shares I said it was but one but the the
[05:23] day after it dumped a little bit so I
[05:25] bought two and I will stay there I mean
[05:27] just three is okay just to participate
[05:30] to the GameStop like thing that could
[05:33] happen also because I think that on
[05:36] other um social
[05:39] networks people are starting to talk
[05:41] about micro
[05:43] strategy it's it's in the top three of
[05:45] one of the websites that talk about
[05:47] stocks I like in mentioning and an
[05:51] incredible data I did I don't know
[05:53] whether you you saw that
[05:55] Robin yesterday but um on Friday
[06:00] micr strategy stock was more traded than
[06:05] Facebook with 8 billion dollar of
[06:09] trading on Friday so I think that we're
[06:13] going to have fun so I just bought the
[06:15] stock a little bit
[06:19] to just to Signal my support of the
[06:24] speculative attack that Michael S is
[06:26] doing to the markets I mean to the
[06:28] dollar sorry
[06:30] and um and to help the eventual short
[06:34] squeeze because there's about 20% of the
[06:38] of the floating which is being shorted
[06:40] and and it's it's increasing and when
[06:43] you look at the the comments from um
[06:48] from people who short it it shows they
[06:50] don't understand this you understand I I
[06:53] mean they just short it because they
[06:55] have the standard view the Fiat view
[06:57] that doesn't see that can't
[07:01] measure the micro strategy strategy from
[07:05] inside the system you know to quote to
[07:08] quote Jeff Bo so there you are and you
[07:12] also said uh about the micel saor
[07:14] speculative attack on the dollar it's
[07:17] interesting for me his stance on on on
[07:19] on the dollar because all of he says
[07:21] that oh if you're safe in the dollar
[07:22] you're a poor person on the one hand but
[07:24] he also says that dollar um not
[07:27] necessarily has to go away uh he says
[07:30] like Bitcoin doesn't has to become a med
[07:32] exchange how do you see that like uh
[07:34] first of all like what what do you think
[07:35] of his comments and do you also uh see
[07:38] it like him that the dollar will always
[07:40] be there or will Bitcoin just take over
[07:42] at some point in like 20 50 100 years
[07:45] yeah um it's an excellent question
[07:48] because
[07:49] uh I have um I I don't have um I mean a
[07:55] certain uh you know a strong opinion on
[07:57] that first of all I would say
[08:00] that we could argue that when Michael S
[08:06] goes on
[08:07] TV he thinks about the audience he
[08:09] thinks
[08:10] about eventual Regulators or who are
[08:14] watching him so he's not going to say
[08:17] yeah I'm going to destroy everything and
[08:18] so
[08:19] forth but it could
[08:22] be
[08:27] chaldo it could be that um
[08:31] he means what he says which means that
[08:35] you save in Bitcoin and you spend in
[08:39] whatever in the end I mean the guy in
[08:42] front of you wants
[08:44] dollar you giveon dollars which could be
[08:47] like
[08:48] through like uh apps like strike or
[08:52] stuff like that that can change your
[08:54] Bitcoin into any um synthetic fiat
[08:58] currency no issue the important thing is
[09:01] is the is the bottom is what you have as
[09:05] the underlying asset underneath you know
[09:07] then the medium of exchange I think it's
[09:10] it has a relative
[09:13] importance having said that even though
[09:16] you know Bitcoin has all the
[09:18] characteristics of money but it's too
[09:20] early to to call it money I agree with
[09:23] that because although it's already
[09:26] accepted on all continents and in all
[09:28] countries in the world
[09:31] um it's still very marginal so you need
[09:35] everybody or many people to own Bitcoin
[09:39] throughout the world who will start to
[09:42] demand Bitcoin as
[09:44] payment and in the
[09:46] end again if I'm in in Europe and I ask
[09:52] for Bitcoin already I'm sure that you
[09:54] like to be paid in Bitcoin more than in
[09:56] Euro yourself I don't know in Austria
[09:59] and and uh if you pay me an EUR I'm
[10:01] going to change I'm I'm I'm going to
[10:03] become fat poor one second afterwards
[10:06] and just swap into into Bitcoin so there
[10:11] you go yeah I think it also um it
[10:14] depends on those threat the The Blaze
[10:18] you are in right now because if you have
[10:20] in Salvador you can spend for example
[10:22] when you're in Austria you would have to
[10:25] uh spend taxes every time you spend with
[10:28] Bitcoin because there are capital gains
[10:31] taxs in Austria yeah this is an issue I
[10:33] agree so you just like you have to see
[10:36] where you are and what your personal
[10:37] setup is right now but you can all
[10:40] always move like you can always like oh
[10:42] then I move to a country where there's
[10:43] no capable actx and it's also
[10:45] interesting that micro strategy
[10:47] outperform Bitcoin uh but uh for the
[10:50] bigger outperformance obviously you
[10:52] don't get the you only get the number G
[10:55] technology not the freedom gr
[10:57] technology uh so always say if you want
[11:01] to be micro strategy um okay do it with
[11:04] like 1% maybe like 5% to just like maybe
[11:07] have a little bit faster stack even then
[11:09] but Bitcoin is quite fast like it's like
[11:13] you you don't need it oh no of course
[11:15] yeah I agree that that you you don't you
[11:17] don't need to you know stay humble stack
[11:21] sets also
[11:23] means uh you you can afford being
[11:27] satisfied of Bitcoin
[11:31] parabolic moves I mean uh it's good
[11:34] enough to have like don't know know 70%
[11:37] cagr or something I don't know where
[11:40] where it is
[11:41] but um yeah I I understand bitcoiners
[11:47] who
[11:48] say
[11:49] that Bitcoin is just
[11:52] money and that it
[11:56] obsoletes uh gambling it obsoletes
[11:58] Trading it
[12:00] obsoletes many ways of what we consider
[12:04] investing so why bother with micro
[12:06] strategy which is just a stock and which
[12:09] in
[12:11] ultimately are you going to use it like
[12:14] a crypto you know crypto just uh pumps
[12:20] to get more
[12:21] Bitcoin this is a question that I am I
[12:24] am asking myself also because as We Know
[12:29] micro strategy outperforms Bitcoin but
[12:31] when the bare Market comes if it ever
[12:35] comes because if you talking about a
[12:38] black hole and so forth it never ends I
[12:41] mean the trend never ends so this is a
[12:43] another question that we could ask
[12:44] ourselves is um is it the life cycle or
[12:48] not you know I think that human
[12:51] psychology does never changes
[12:55] so there again I don't have a strong
[12:57] opinion on that but uh um I don't think
[13:00] it's life cycle certain point is is
[13:02] going to go vertical hopefully there's
[13:05] no like China band stuff or that will
[13:08] that will just uh cut off the the
[13:10] blowoff top let's see but
[13:14] uh I mean on the in the long run price
[13:18] is the is the least interesting thing
[13:20] right about
[13:21] Bitcoin is the the fgu that counts
[13:25] Freedom absolutely Absolut and uh if the
[13:28] price goes up and and uh then you have
[13:30] Bitcoin that actually uh has to be
[13:32] secured somehow and this is I think the
[13:35] the best topic to talk to talk about
[13:38] with you and I have it on the podcast
[13:40] regularly because I think self cust is
[13:42] such an important topic so I regularly
[13:45] invite people to talk in a podcast about
[13:47] self custody about self custody solution
[13:49] what they should do and uh I thought
[13:52] about today that we can structure it in
[13:55] different segments uh because if you
[13:57] have $500 in Bitcoin you have you need a
[14:00] different setup if you have $500,000 in
[14:03] in Bitcoin uh so let's take like the
[14:07] first step uh what do you recommend
[14:10] people um to have a s cust solution
[14:14] under, do you even recommend them to
[14:16] have a self- custody solution um if what
[14:20] is the the the dollar value or the
[14:24] Satoshi value you would say okay now you
[14:27] have to get the self cust the solution
[14:30] like first wallet your first whatever
[14:33] yeah I think that first of all no
[14:34] Financial advice is more technical or I
[14:37] mean anybody I think that people should
[14:39] gather information and decide for
[14:42] themselves and the amount of monetary
[14:46] units also is are very relative like
[14:49] $1,000 could be a lot for me and nothing
[14:52] for you so maybe it's you could reason
[14:55] in percentage of your portfolio your age
[15:00] uh your risk appetite and things like
[15:02] that but in general and it's good also
[15:06] that
[15:07] you that you
[15:09] divide uh the custody categories into
[15:15] nonone and self you know and in the end
[15:21] the the several levels are first of all
[15:25] where do I buy Bitcoin in general unless
[15:29] by P2P which wouldn't mean that I really
[15:31] have
[15:32] problems based on where I live or I'm
[15:35] already a little bit um not a geek but
[15:39] maybe a
[15:41] privacy uh fan or something in general I
[15:46] buy Bitcoin on an exchange
[15:48] right and on an exchange you can really
[15:51] buy from $10 to 1
[15:53] million and this is where things already
[15:58] get interesting
[16:00] because um so an exchange such as
[16:03] binance and you know coinbase and Kraken
[16:07] and all the rest this is where it's not
[16:09] your keys not your coins so your Bitcoin
[16:13] is not your Bitcoin because it's exactly
[16:16] the same concept as your Euro or your
[16:19] dollars or your pounds to be a bank
[16:22] account where you you see your name so
[16:25] you see your name but it's just an IOU
[16:29] so because the keys are not yours you
[16:32] move the the value of your investment or
[16:35] your your
[16:37] stack uh provided that those people
[16:40] accept to do it you know
[16:43] [Music]
[16:44] so to to put like an amount I would say
[16:50] roughly from zero
[16:53] to 100 to
[16:56] 500 um
[16:59] Euro or dollar you you you can keep it
[17:02] there but if your reasoning then is to
[17:05] stack regularly you can talk of a DCA
[17:09] too then what you can do is to to
[17:12] withdraw your
[17:14] Bitcoin we could also talk about yeah
[17:18] okay just so you can withdraw your
[17:21] Bitcoin to an address which is still
[17:24] very easy to use because you can say
[17:26] okay I'm not an expert I just started
[17:29] dabling into Bitcoin I start
[17:31] understanding that self costed is
[17:32] important but I'm
[17:34] not a you know a techie or
[17:38] whatever and I'm not going to buy
[17:41] a I mean let's keep it
[17:44] simple I want to move my coins to an
[17:47] address that I control and that's easy
[17:50] to use and there you think about the
[17:53] Bitcoin only
[17:55] apps such as relay okay number number
[17:59] one I am in Europe so if you if you're
[18:03] in Europe it's easier to think of a
[18:04] relay because it's not available yet on
[18:07] other continents and I'm part of relay
[18:12] Squad um but you have also coinfinity I
[18:16] think in Austria right yes in Austria we
[18:18] have coinfinity and 21 Bitcoin as
[18:21] Bitcoin only exchanges exactly by the
[18:23] way I wanted to put my 21 Bitcoin
[18:26] t-shirt because of of my 100 Push
[18:29] [Laughter]
[18:31] challenge that I won in
[18:33] M um yeah so uh so you move your coins
[18:38] from like binance to relay and this is
[18:42] quite easy to to do I'm not going to
[18:44] tell you how to do it but it's just to
[18:46] use the Bitcoin
[18:48] blockchain and maybe by the way now you
[18:51] can also use light the lightning
[18:54] network from specifically from from
[18:58] binance to relay I I should try it by
[19:00] the
[19:01] way and um so what what do I mean is
[19:05] that uh apps Bitcoin only apps such as
[19:09] relay are
[19:10] are um what we call non-custodial hot
[19:17] wallets okay so the the it means what
[19:21] that it's your keys but you're still on
[19:23] the
[19:25] internet so it's theoretically hackable
[19:29] nothing has happened yet but it's not
[19:31] the best the very best level of
[19:35] security so even like like if r one day
[19:41] had problems or you still have your app
[19:44] and you can still move your
[19:46] points so this is absolutely fundamental
[19:49] but in the end when you talk about the
[19:51] people of of um Bitcoin only hot
[19:56] wallet um n Cal which means you custody
[20:01] your coins they themselves
[20:05] say uh
[20:07] we please feel free to move your coins
[20:11] from us because we are a reasonable
[20:15] level we offer
[20:16] livable uh uh level security but it's
[20:20] not the top level of
[20:24] security so what would the the next
[20:27] level be
[20:29] so first of
[20:30] all talking about amounts like on relay
[20:35] on such an app you could you could have
[20:37] like between I'm just putting numbers
[20:40] but 1,000 to 10,000 for
[20:44] example let see yeah
[20:47] 10,000 this justify an extra level of
[20:51] security and this is where the hardware
[20:55] wallet kicks in and this is
[20:59] a
[21:00] physical uh object that we also call
[21:03] signing device because in the end it's
[21:05] just a signing
[21:07] device
[21:09] um and this is
[21:11] where uh it justifies your stack
[21:14] justifies the purchasing of a physical
[21:17] object because a Bitcoin only app going
[21:21] back to there is is free you just
[21:23] download the app and the cost is zero
[21:25] because you have your phone
[21:27] already but when you have once you have
[21:30] like several thousands Euro
[21:32] dollars or pounds you say I can spend
[21:36] like
[21:37] 100 euro dollar
[21:41] pound it it it will mean it's going to
[21:44] be $100 yeah less of of of SATs but it's
[21:49] not a problem because like it's it's
[21:52] like an insurance you know so you say
[21:55] okay it AB it's absolutely worth
[21:57] spending
[21:59] uh 100 to to gain more
[22:03] Tranquility then the next step and this
[22:06] is where TBA kicks
[22:08] in is okay I'm a b corner I know how to
[22:12] handle
[22:14] my My Signing
[22:17] device my
[22:20] family kicks me out of the WhatsApp
[22:23] group because I talked I talk about
[22:25] Bitcoin too
[22:26] much and they don't want to know or to
[22:30] listen to you especially anymore
[22:34] Cho
[22:36] um and so what what happens if if I get
[22:39] hit by a
[22:41] bus my family maybe doesn't know that I
[22:44] have
[22:45] Bitcoin or doesn't know how to move the
[22:48] coins and this is very
[22:51] serious so how do
[22:54] you solve the
[22:57] problem the the solution would be
[23:01] multisig which means that to move your
[23:03] coins you me you you you move you you
[23:06] you you need several
[23:10] signatures but um I'm going to
[23:13] concentrate if if I may on TBA
[23:18] solution um which is the following or to
[23:22] put simply is tendentially a two of
[23:25] three
[23:26] multisig where
[23:30] um we remove as much as we can because
[23:34] the perfect solution does not exist it's
[23:36] all about trade-offs you know but it's I
[23:39] think it's the closest solution to
[23:43] perfection even Bitcoin is not perfect
[23:46] you know it's just the
[23:48] best it that it removed the single point
[23:50] of
[23:51] failure which means that even if I
[23:55] die and that my family is not able ble
[23:58] to move the coins and that my family
[24:00] didn't even know that they that I had
[24:02] Bitcoin they will have access to the
[24:04] coins
[24:07] how
[24:10] um it's so there's a procedure of
[24:13] onboarding where we ask the customer or
[24:17] the client to buy for example treasure I
[24:21] mean we we
[24:22] are absolutely platform agnostic you
[24:26] know or platform agnostic to buy the
[24:29] Bitcoin and a hardware wallet agnostic
[24:32] to buy the to okay so we
[24:36] tendentially uh uh ask the the clients
[24:40] to buy trasor because it's a very good
[24:43] um compromise between ease of use and
[24:49] cost and
[24:52] security because of course the air gaped
[24:55] call card is super cool and we
[24:57] acknowledge that is
[24:58] one of the best and so forth but it's
[25:00] not easy to
[25:02] use objectively you know and treasur is
[25:06] good enough and uh I have a bit box for
[25:08] example and uh this is I think it's it's
[25:11] a good one too Ledger is fine as as as
[25:15] long as you don't go on Dows and things
[25:18] like that so I wouldn't bury Ledger
[25:21] completely you know then I I don't want
[25:24] either to to publicize or to criticize
[25:26] um harwards uh singularly because there
[25:30] again everybody
[25:32] finds their own shoe to their own feet
[25:35] you know depending yeah on on on what
[25:38] ass sets of prices of use security and
[25:41] so
[25:42] forth so basically going back to TBA
[25:46] solution so you client have your own key
[25:48] you have your stack there you don't want
[25:50] to be to to get hit by your birth of
[25:53] course but you organize yourself and you
[25:55] prepare for the worst so
[25:59] in the end TBA has a second
[26:01] key and our technology provider or multi
[26:06] provider which could be uh Unchained
[26:09] it's mainly Unchained at the
[26:12] moment uh it could be ncheck for example
[26:15] they hold the third key so the client or
[26:19] their
[26:21] beneficiaries will just have to use two
[26:24] of the three keys to move the
[26:26] coins okay
[26:30] and um sorry so two of three is okay and
[26:36] um what what what that entails is that
[26:38] even if you are still alive but you lose
[26:41] your keys there's no issue because you
[26:43] can move you can use tbas and the
[26:47] technology providers key which are still
[26:51] two then if we have as TBA a problem
[26:55] because private company and anything can
[26:57] happen there are still still ways for
[26:59] you cryptographically not going to go
[27:01] into the details to to get access to the
[27:05] Keys and then you can ask wait a minute
[27:08] your family doesn't even know that you
[27:10] have Bitcoin and they will have access
[27:12] to it how does that work I mean like
[27:15] magic and the the the answer is just
[27:19] that we set up or we help clients set
[27:22] up
[27:24] um their
[27:26] um uh Ian
[27:29] took with with with the
[27:31] notary so that when the notary opens the
[27:35] envelope of what goes to the family that
[27:39] you have the correct information that
[27:41] will allow the
[27:43] clients to know that uh uh that the
[27:47] Bitcoin is there I mean is accessible
[27:50] and then they contact CBA and TBA help
[27:54] them get back the the control of the
[27:56] coins so
[27:58] unfortunately we had uh since 12 uh
[28:04] 2016
[28:05] um five opportunities let's say to
[28:09] verify that it works so the pleb passed
[28:13] away
[28:14] unfortunately the family contacted us
[28:17] and the coins were recovered so zero
[28:21] sets lost and just chronologically just
[28:24] to tell you that um TBA has been
[28:27] existing for one year only roughly like
[28:29] early
[28:31] 2023 but the service has been existing
[28:33] for uh seven years now so
[28:36] 2016 because Peter donor I'm sure he he
[28:40] he he told you already but he's been
[28:43] managing a multif family office in
[28:44] Australia for 17 years or something and
[28:47] he's been offering this multisig uh uh
[28:51] Cal Service uh
[28:54] for yeah so since 12 2016
[28:59] so to his like Normy clients let's call
[29:01] it I mean not not necessarily
[29:04] bitcoiners and uh so his AUM now is
[29:07] about $1 billion doar US and about 10%
[29:10] of that is in Bitcoin and for a year
[29:12] this service which has been existing
[29:14] again for years isn't now available
[29:18] globally to anybody you and me included
[29:20] 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one
[29:24] and they teach and preach self- custody
[29:27] this is my goat to exchange when someone
[29:29] asks me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin
[29:32] from this is the easiest entry for
[29:35] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[29:37] Plus at the same time support this
[29:40] podcast use code Robin and click the
[29:42] link in the description yeah that's
[29:44] amazing and I think uh the importance is
[29:47] uh that we have self- custody especially
[29:50] if we're talking about 500 euros dollars
[29:53] or 1,000 doar more than that and uh then
[29:58] the important part comes and that's why
[30:00] we need multi signature
[30:01] Solutions uh the first part is as you
[30:04] said when you die but there's also the
[30:06] risk of or eliminating all the um single
[30:12] point of failures because if someone if
[30:15] you have everything at home and someone
[30:17] breaks in fortunately the break-ins the
[30:20] physical break-ins get less and less
[30:22] over time because people know there's
[30:23] more and more in the in the garden less
[30:25] and less value actually in the house but
[30:27] they still happening uh then especially
[30:30] if if someone gets to know your address
[30:32] and they actually um have uh you you
[30:36] it's it's known that you have Bitcoin uh
[30:39] then there's a single point of failure
[30:41] because they can come home they can
[30:42] search or even like uh you have it at
[30:45] home someone finds it like even like a
[30:48] friend finds it and then and gets like
[30:50] the 24 word list like there's so many
[30:52] things to it um that are risk associated
[30:56] where we you have a multi signature
[30:58] solution with two out of three four uh
[31:00] two three out of five whatever your
[31:02] preferred solution is it's a benefit
[31:05] from you and of course this is something
[31:08] you need to set up once and you need you
[31:11] need it to set up uh good and there is
[31:14] like the Bitcoin advisory that helps you
[31:16] you can obviously do it on your own also
[31:19] um with with or there's other companies
[31:22] and there's a lot of possibilities you
[31:24] can do it um but uh the important part
[31:27] is that you actually get to know your
[31:31] situation and that you try to to get the
[31:34] best setup possible uh for you because
[31:37] everyone is has a different setup
[31:38] everyone is like someone wants to get
[31:41] one key to a trusted uh family member
[31:44] maybe because maybe they they keep the
[31:47] Family Savings in there uh someone just
[31:51] wants to be on his own and maybe like
[31:53] the uh what do you actually think of uh
[31:56] having multi signature deposits but
[31:59] where you have like maybe five keys and
[32:01] you put like one or two in a safe
[32:03] deposit box in a bank do you also
[32:05] recommend that uh doing that well
[32:09] uh I wouldn't recommend it myself
[32:12] because I am myself and everybody has
[32:15] their own needs but I would say that uh
[32:20] it reduces nicely risks uh in on some
[32:26] aspects like um
[32:28] for example if you're under jurs you
[32:31] know that somebody tells you give me
[32:33] your keys so I'm going to $5 $5 at
[32:36] wrench attack you maybe this could be a
[32:39] a nice solution and by the way we have
[32:41] means ourselves to solve that problem
[32:44] because we we have me we have set up
[32:47] some uh tactics to agree with the
[32:50] clients that if we uh organize a video
[32:53] call and they are under dress with a guy
[32:57] with a with a handgun behind them uh we
[33:00] have codes like visual
[33:02] codes to make understand that we we we
[33:07] understand that the person is is under
[33:08] JS and we're going to move we're not
[33:10] going to move the coins and in the
[33:12] contract we have also um we have a
[33:16] specific line where we are not going to
[33:19] to move the coins in those
[33:21] situations so to answer your question
[33:24] yeah it's it's fine I mean uh it's
[33:28] always better than uh than keeping them
[33:30] on on on binance for
[33:32] sure everything is better than keeping
[33:34] it on binance I think yeah and by the
[33:37] way I'm going to tell you a short story
[33:39] which is
[33:40] shocking I'm not going to tell you who
[33:44] it is of course because but I know
[33:47] somebody who had uh a
[33:52] um uh a problem of
[33:56] a an explosion in the apartment mhm and
[34:01] uh it was so strong that all the clothes
[34:04] and the stuff were basically landed in
[34:06] the The Neighbors
[34:08] apartment wow and um then he had to move
[34:11] country and so forth and in the end he
[34:15] told me that he he has his coins on
[34:20] coinbase which was quite
[34:22] surprising so I think that there are
[34:25] still many people and who have many
[34:27] coins who are not yet don't have the
[34:32] Sensitivity I
[34:34] mean they the word education which I I
[34:38] heard a lot in Mad is probably the word
[34:40] the word that I heard the most which is
[34:44] very nice because it's fundamental is
[34:47] education and I think
[34:50] that um Everybody Needs education
[34:53] included many people who have many coins
[34:55] you know it's not because you have many
[34:58] coins that you are more educated than
[34:59] others I think definely now that 2024 I
[35:02] think is going to be the like the
[35:05] beginning of the visible Mass adoption
[35:07] and people like Boomers or
[35:10] such who are not lazy so who are not
[35:13] going to buy these SP
[35:16] ETFs they they buy their coins and maybe
[35:18] they don't realize all this you know
[35:21] self- custy fundamental aspect of
[35:23] Bitcoin which is one of the reasons why
[35:26] Bitcoin exists
[35:28] you know it's you own your
[35:30] money and you hold it
[35:33] yourself yeah definitely and I think
[35:35] it's still astonishing to me that people
[35:38] uh I know several people that have uh
[35:42] Bitcoins that even have high amounts of
[35:45] Bitcoins and they hold it on coinbase
[35:47] because they don't care they're like ah
[35:49] they get they can take better care of my
[35:51] coins than me and I'm like first of all
[35:54] there are solutions out there that help
[35:56] you if you want to just pay for for
[35:57] service like the Bitcoin advisory like
[36:00] also you mentioned nchu Unchained
[36:02] there's Kasa there are so many services
[36:04] out there that help you um get over the
[36:07] hurdle that you don't have to educate
[36:09] yourself too much I still recommend
[36:12] everybody to get educated like this is
[36:14] the first part no matter with with whom
[36:17] you're working no matter what you're
[36:18] doing with your Bitcoin yeah it's a new
[36:20] paradigm so a new paradigm by
[36:22] definitions have have many aspects that
[36:26] that change completely your your your
[36:28] worldview and self- custody which means
[36:31] self
[36:33] responsibility is a new thing because I
[36:35] think that uh people just lost their
[36:38] ability to be free somehow you know
[36:41] freedom is scary because it it
[36:44] entails uh individual responsibility
[36:47] with where in the case of Bitcoin you
[36:49] don't
[36:49] have uh any anybody to call you know in
[36:54] case of of an issue so
[36:58] you have to educate yourself it's
[36:59] fundamental yeah what do you think of
[37:01] more advanced tools like buying Bitcoin
[37:04] no KC PE top coin mixing them uh utxo
[37:10] management uh the the things that people
[37:13] Bitcoin has learn above self custody
[37:15] what do you think of those yeah I think
[37:18] it's all there again it's uh it's all
[37:21] important uh uh for their own reasons um
[37:26] and it's just part of the natural uh
[37:29] path of of learning you know because uh
[37:33] if you think about like
[37:35] P2P um if you're European you basically
[37:39] don't give a damn you just go in the
[37:41] exchange and there you go if you're in
[37:45] in in in in autocratic hyper
[37:48] inflationist I don't know what I mean
[37:50] south of the world countries and so
[37:51] forth where by the way they're already
[37:54] used to use P2P
[37:56] logics
[37:58] um then you go to you know uh Robo SATs
[38:04] you go to hudle
[38:06] huddle you go to there's a the there's
[38:09] one that I would like to to
[38:11] mention because three four six months
[38:14] ago I just tweeted for I want to buy P2P
[38:18] what you recommend me and it was I was
[38:21] happy to see that many people answered
[38:23] and you know that about half of the
[38:25] answers were vexel
[38:27] V
[38:30] XL have you ever heard of them uh yes
[38:33] they will come on my podcast uh soon I
[38:36] don't know when exactly but I think we
[38:38] already set a a date with them um and
[38:42] they will come on the podcast in the
[38:43] next like 10
[38:46] 20 this is very good because I think
[38:48] that they they deserve more more
[38:49] visibility where basically you have like
[38:52] buy Bitcoin sell Bitcoin in the end uh
[38:55] if you want to sell potatoes
[38:58] it's you click on buy Bitcoin you know
[39:01] it's like you want Bitcoin
[39:04] inwards and um yeah in Madera I talked
[39:08] with Charlene fpo who's American and
[39:11] she's also active in Africa and in
[39:14] during the party there's a guy from Vex
[39:16] unfortunately I can't remember what his
[39:18] name was but we started a discussion
[39:21] between Charlene who is active in Africa
[39:24] and
[39:25] him so let's hope that vexel goes like
[39:28] on the radar also in Africa I I think
[39:32] it's it's available there also uh just
[39:35] to to give more optionality to folks
[39:38] like in Nigeria where the government
[39:40] started again to to to create problems
[39:43] about with Bitcoin and and all that
[39:46] stuff then you were asking Robin about
[39:49] um for example utxo management yes
[39:54] so um I'm not going to make it
[39:58] a course now but utxo management is
[40:01] really important because I mean
[40:02] especially if you have small Stacks
[40:05] because it just might generate uh a
[40:10] situation in which your your s is is
[40:12] blocked because it's not worth moving it
[40:15] anymore because it's going to cost you
[40:17] more moving the coins than uh the value
[40:21] of your stack itself and how can that
[40:24] happen I mean unless you're on on the
[40:26] lightning Network
[40:28] already so if you are on on L1 uh on the
[40:33] on on the Bitcoin time chain in in and
[40:37] it's very precious
[40:40] low memory per block you know I mean
[40:44] don't
[40:45] don't what you need to do is to
[40:48] consolidate your your utxos which means
[40:51] if you have like I don't know 100 euros
[40:55] $100 dollar of Bitcoin
[40:57] but you deposited them on your address
[41:00] like in 10 times you have 10
[41:02] utxos and when you
[41:05] move these like your hundred uh dollars
[41:09] or
[41:10] Euros uh you are going to use more space
[41:14] in the block you're are going to use for
[41:15] your
[41:17] transaction and we know that the the
[41:20] block space uh is going to be more and
[41:22] more rare precious demanded used uh
[41:27] including for big transactions and so
[41:30] forth so what you need to do in this
[41:33] case is to have a look at mle
[41:36] dospace which is I think the best
[41:38] website where you can observe what's
[41:40] going on inside the Bitcoin time
[41:45] chain and the first thing you see on on
[41:50] the screen apart from the Block
[41:51] themselves is underneath the SATs per
[41:54] Vite cost so it's basically the the cost
[42:00] of the of the space used inside the
[42:03] inside the block so if you move1
[42:06] billion with one utxo the transaction
[42:10] will cost you less than a $100
[42:13] transaction with 10 10 utxos because
[42:16] it's not the amount because it's just
[42:18] it's just information it's the number of
[42:20] utxos you use so this is just a very
[42:24] simple way to to put it so from time to
[42:26] time look at the you takes of of on have
[42:30] a look on on mle do space and
[42:34] um and when it's low like in the 20
[42:38] 30s SATs per V bite take the opportunity
[42:42] to move also because during the bull run
[42:45] this number tends to go up and now
[42:48] although it's where we are at alltime
[42:51] highs everybody's still sleeping so the
[42:54] M pole is is quite empty so it might be
[42:56] a good to do
[42:59] it definitely I think it's a it's a
[43:02] great way uh it and I think this is like
[43:06] one of the topics like you man up
[43:11] morecast also it comes up more and more
[43:14] in general in the Bitcoin community and
[43:17] it's just another thing that bitcoiners
[43:20] with s responibility have to learn over
[43:23] time like we have um self custody we
[43:26] have
[43:27] um you take Soul management then you
[43:29] have uh if you want to go the Privacy
[43:32] route or you have to go the Privacy
[43:34] route because where you live uh then
[43:36] there's no kyc and coxing maybe
[43:39] important multi signature is like part
[43:41] of the self custody
[43:43] Solutions uh perfect um let's uh change
[43:47] a little bit the the tone um what do you
[43:50] think uh like it's interesting for me
[43:53] and maybe it's also interesting for you
[43:55] there's still a lot of Al coins out
[43:58] there there's still a lot of uh
[44:00] coining out there and I ask myself from
[44:03] time to time why like uh if if we really
[44:08] see in there there are some where you
[44:10] can make an argument okay there's a use
[44:13] case but it's inefficient and maybe
[44:14] there's a better solution to it um do
[44:17] you see first of all you Bitcoin only or
[44:19] are you
[44:21] not yes so I still have a small bag of
[44:26] the
[44:27] of the last uh
[44:30] cycle I I admit it because we are in the
[44:33] admitting period where people say yeah I
[44:36] admit I have Micro strategy I still have
[44:40] one one bag of just one crypto coin that
[44:42] I didn't sell I just let it
[44:46] go um but let's say
[44:48] that I didn't buy any
[44:53] recently and
[44:55] um so
[44:57] I think
[45:00] that going to the uh the crypto land
[45:05] route is very uh difficult to avoid when
[45:10] you start into crypto land crypto land
[45:14] meaning including Bitcoin just you know
[45:17] crypto what is it I buy some or maybe I
[45:20] buy only Bitcoin because I heard about
[45:22] it and then I see that Bitcoin is
[45:24] performing in the Bull Run of course
[45:26] because uh you're not going to to to buy
[45:29] cryptos during the bare market
[45:31] right you are not you are going to to
[45:35] buy them when TV starts talking about
[45:37] Bitcoin so you buy your Bitcoin and then
[45:39] you see oh Solana is going more up and
[45:42] so forth so you just diversify your
[45:44] crypto portfolio let's say and greed
[45:47] takes you
[45:49] here and you're going to get wrecked so
[45:53] I think that 99% of Bitcoin Maxis are
[45:56] people who
[45:57] got wrecked by crypto during their
[46:00] journey I am one of them uh leverage
[46:03] also so sticking to to to
[46:07] crypto um one question that we could ask
[46:11] is is this bull run going to be as cry
[46:16] crypto is as as before because 20 I mean
[46:20] from 2015 to
[46:24] 2021 it was I think the C
[46:27] explosion era you know like billions of
[46:31] of years ago when life appeared on on
[46:36] Earth you had an immense quantity of of
[46:41] uh forms of life
[46:44] blossoming and not not all of them uh
[46:48] went through you survived and I think
[46:51] that crypto is a bit what's happening to
[46:53] bitcoin
[46:55] um you cannot avoid it because humans
[46:58] again are humans and they're going toh
[47:01] be tempted on one side to scam the
[47:03] others and on the other side to make
[47:07] more money which means to make more Fiat
[47:10] which means you don't understand Bitcoin
[47:13] because the goal is to have more Bitcoin
[47:14] is and less Fiat and crypto is more part
[47:17] of Fiat than part
[47:20] of yeah then then it's it's it's closer
[47:23] to Fat than to bitcoin for sure yeah for
[47:26] me it's just like um we have the feat
[47:29] kind of mindset kind of system and we
[47:32] have Bitcoin uh mindset and system and
[47:35] the only difference between feat and
[47:37] crypto is that feat is stored on
[47:40] centralized um database entries and
[47:44] crypto is sort on centralized uh
[47:48] blockchain technology like it's it's not
[47:50] decentralized it's like it's just a
[47:52] different way to store data uh so
[47:54] actually for me crypto is just
[47:57] inefficient way yeah of having
[48:02] fear no sense for me yeah I mean there's
[48:06] a there's a like a it's not even a meme
[48:08] actually it's like you have a diagram
[48:12] where uh do you need a uh Native digital
[48:17] uh Native internet
[48:20] money
[48:22] no you don't need
[48:25] blockchain then if yes Bitcoin is the
[48:30] only blockchain that
[48:31] works this is the end of the
[48:36] diagram yeah that's a that's a that's a
[48:39] crazy one yeah and then again um you
[48:42] could say that uh crypto is to bitcoin
[48:45] what the internet bubble was to the
[48:49] internet in 2000 which
[48:51] means uh when when when people founded
[48:55] company or added Doom to the to the to
[48:58] the name of the companies in the same
[49:00] way they act blockchain to to their
[49:02] current comp web 3 to the current
[49:05] companies VCS I money would flow in but
[49:09] in the end after the bubble what
[49:10] remained the protocol tcpip internet
[49:15] didn't give a damn about the internet
[49:17] bubble the protocol the the better idea
[49:19] was present and uh it thrives naturally
[49:23] because and bottom up also and not not
[49:26] top down or Market down of a market I
[49:29] mean
[49:31] uh yeah bottom up is is the way and
[49:35] Bitcoin is the same like every cycle you
[49:39] have uh
[49:41] new new fluff new stuff but Bitcoin is
[49:45] the only one that goes up and up and up
[49:48] because it's the better idea so I think
[49:51] it's a it's a respectable way to um to
[49:56] make a
[49:57] parallel amazing and uh we're coming
[50:01] closer to the end of the podcast and I
[50:02] would have have two questions the one
[50:04] question is from me uh and then we have
[50:07] the end routine where the previous guest
[50:09] asked you a question and they're kind of
[50:13] related uh but I will still ask them
[50:17] separately um what would you say has
[50:20] Bitcoin contributed to your life besides
[50:23] the financial aspects besides number
[50:26] technology
[50:27] uh besides uh just having better
[50:31] money yeah but first of all
[50:34] unfortunately yesterday I went on the
[50:36] Lego def fimon here uh on a boat and I I
[50:39] I I lost it all but before
[50:43] that
[50:45] um
[50:48] uh a nice way to illustrate what it did
[50:52] to me like you know that we say that
[50:54] Bitcoin changes
[50:55] you is like since I have worked for
[50:59] about 20 years in um
[51:02] corporates uh LinkedIn was my natural
[51:06] ecosystem you know so since like the
[51:11] late night no early 2000s maybe I mean
[51:15] yeah I was quite early in
[51:17] LinkedIn and
[51:20] um
[51:22] so I see that my uh behavior on LinkedIn
[51:28] which is like really Peak Fiat
[51:29] politically correct and so forth has
[51:32] changed radically
[51:34] because when you have Bitcoin you can
[51:38] afford being
[51:39] yourself because you're not scared
[51:41] anymore
[51:42] of what your employer or potential
[51:45] clients or what could could could think
[51:49] of you or or you're not scared of what
[51:51] they could do to you or whatever which
[51:54] doesn't mean that you not that you're
[51:56] going to should lack respect to to
[51:58] people of course the respect will be
[52:00] there but truth will will come out of
[52:02] your mouth a lot
[52:05] easier so when people deserve a little
[52:08] bit of
[52:09] toxicity that that's okay also because I
[52:12] say that toxicity is a bit like um cod
[52:14] liver oil it tastes bad but it's good
[52:16] for
[52:17] you I'm I'm here to help you if you want
[52:20] to open your eyes you have to open your
[52:22] ears before please listen to me you
[52:25] don't have to
[52:27] so to answer your question LinkedIn is
[52:31] is just I can observe really day by day
[52:35] that it changes you because you can be
[52:38] yourself amazing it's it's I think uh
[52:42] when you have uh Bitcoin and you
[52:44] actually stand to yourself and stand to
[52:47] the truth uh you become more respected
[52:50] long term because you said like uh the
[52:52] respect is a thing and I think maybe
[52:54] shortterm people are look looking weird
[52:57] to you but long term they will respect
[52:59] you so much more because you stood up
[53:01] for something and I always respect
[53:04] people even though they sometimes stand
[53:07] up for stuff that I don't like but even
[53:09] though they stand up for stuff that I
[53:11] don't like I respect the hell out of
[53:13] them that they are standing up for
[53:14] something they're not like a a grass
[53:18] that just Moves In The Wind uh something
[53:20] like that yeah and we having an end
[53:22] routine where the previous guest asked
[53:24] um a question for the next guest
[53:27] and the previous guest asked you a
[53:31] very broad question which has nothing to
[53:34] do with Bitcoin what is the meaning of
[53:37] life for
[53:40] you very broad question I think
[53:44] that it's to gain
[53:48] um uh become
[53:53] wise we talked about it with my wife the
[53:56] other day today by the way it what is
[53:59] wisdom to you she asked
[54:01] me broad
[54:05] question and uh I think that it comes
[54:10] with the experience observation and
[54:12] experience so you're not going to get to
[54:15] be born uh
[54:18] wise I think when you imagine a wise
[54:20] person you imagine an old person more
[54:23] than a young
[54:24] one so I think that uh the meaning of
[54:28] life would
[54:30] be do things also because it doing
[54:35] things rather than thinking too much is
[54:38] a way of gaining uh self-awareness
[54:43] self-confidence to find better your your
[54:46] place in in in in the
[54:51] world and um I think that Bitcoin allows
[54:54] you to do
[54:57] things you like to do or you good at in
[55:00] an easier way because it you are Freer
[55:04] the factor you
[55:06] know
[55:08] so I'm not sure I I can bring a better
[55:12] short answer to that very broad question
[55:15] yeah I think this is like a question you
[55:17] can you can talk another two hours for
[55:20] so we we will keep it at that and maybe
[55:22] we can I managed to put Bitcoin in in
[55:25] that's the important thing
[55:27] I was expecting maybe like the meaning
[55:29] of life is to gain more Bitcoin yeah
[55:32] yeah yeah it's by way of course of
[55:35] course um it was an amazing podcast it
[55:38] was
[55:39] unconventionally uh but it was really
[55:42] really cool with someone outside walking
[55:44] this first podcast I you the seven uh 73
[55:48] uh guests like I'm approaching the 100
[55:51] guest Mark uh and this the first one
[55:54] outside maybe I will do it also one day
[55:57] where we like have a setup outside and
[56:00] and yeah thank you for for doing it this

[56:06] like not much light it's close to vensa
[56:09] it's about one hour away from Venice and
[56:12] there's a beautiful Lake down there
[56:15] which is older it's it looks like a pond
[56:17] but it's it's older than the Lake Garda

[56:24] nice little place here to be honest
[56:25] really very cool so thank you very much

[56:49] my
[56:51] endb but uh I am an Noster on the on the
[56:55] name of n Smith so is n UF Smith in one
[56:59] word and it's the same on Twitter on x n
[57:02] o UF Smith and uh on LinkedIn there are
[57:08] thousands of Stefan Smith so you just
[57:11] put Stefan Smith with an F Stefan with
[57:13] an F Smith uh Bitcoin and you're gonna
[57:16] find me perfect uh actually you're not
[57:19] going to find me these days because I
[57:21] was kicked out of LinkedIn for the
[57:22] seventh time recently and I'm doing my
[57:25] seventh appeal
[57:27] oh I I saw it because when I was
[57:30] researching you uh I saw on the Bitcoin
[57:33] advisory website your profile and there
[57:36] was a link to LinkedIn and then it's
[57:38] like site not available so I was like
[57:42] maybe something went wrong yeah yeah so
[57:44] I have to apologize to Peter and Andy on
[57:47] that but uh on on on LinkedIn you do you
[57:51] as a bitcoiner and sometimes you know
[57:53] Bitcoin is a is a theme it's it's it's a
[57:56] it it can happen and it's okay yeah yeah
[58:00] seven really really cool like it's it's
[58:02] it's an a growing number yeah but it's
[58:06] nice to see just to conclude that
[58:08] LinkedIn is Twitter rizing you see that
[58:09] people are becoming more more and
[58:12] more you know they more and more be
[58:14] corners and uh it's it's a
[58:18] popular
[58:20] uh social network so it it's it's
[58:24] improving yeah I it's still censored
[58:27] though so that's an issue definitely I I
[58:30] recently made my first uh LinkedIn post
[58:33] uh so that was interesting to see but
[58:35] I'm not active there but people write me
[58:38] even there oh I enjoyed your podcast and
[58:41] so stuff like that so I was like okay
[58:42] let's let's let's at least make one post
[58:45] so that the the Fe is not completely
[58:48] empty okay that's signal that's signal
[58:51] that
[58:52] signal perfect and Stefan thank you uh
