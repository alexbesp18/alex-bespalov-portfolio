[00:00] even if you're a saver you know you
[00:02] realize that your money every year buys
[00:04] you less and less and less I think
[00:06] Bitcoin helps you to realize that those
[00:09] things are so frivolous I'm at at this
[00:11] point in my life I have to choose a nice
[00:13] car versus quality time with my family I
[00:16] will take quality time 100 times there's
[00:19] something and and this is I'm paying
[00:21] attention to on a daily basis every day
[00:23] that I wake up there's at least two
[00:25] three bullish news about Bitcoin I'm on
[00:28] another level where I just I want to
[00:31] have a peace of mind I want to enjoy my
[00:32] family I have a little daughter I want
[00:34] to enjoy my family and just focus on the
[00:36] future for her for us and I became a
[00:39] maxi so I sold all my y stuff out a loss
[00:42] some of them and converted everything to
[00:45] bitcoin since then and that's been my
[00:47] journey pretty much a lot of people are
[00:49] kind to convert their their second third
[00:51] fourth uh home and apartment into
[00:53] Bitcoin just a matter of time it's
[00:55] already happening by the way
[00:58] [Music]
[01:01] actually sailor helped me a lot because
[01:03] I was listening to him kind of like for
[01:06] therapy and he worked and I became a
[01:10] maxi so I sold all my y stuff out of
[01:13] loss some of them and converted
[01:17] everything to bitcoin since then and
[01:19] that's been my journey pretty much
[01:22] interesting yeah I think we can directly
[01:24] start into with with with that kind of
[01:27] um let's start with uh with Cuba and and
[01:31] how and why you you went away there from
[01:36] uh you said like escaped from communism
[01:38] but like how was the situation when you
[01:40] left and and what was the reason that
[01:42] that you left there well if you live in
[01:45] Cuba I mean q is
[01:48] a communist country has been a communist
[01:50] country for over 50 years now and as
[01:55] every communist country there is nothing
[01:57] there either to do or to have pretty
[01:59] much
[02:00] especially if you're not part of the
[02:02] government if you're not into let's say
[02:05] government government job or government
[02:07] entity chances are you're just trying to
[02:09] survive and a lot of Cubans left in the
[02:12] 80s they came here to the United States
[02:15] um by vat
[02:18] karitos uh and a lot of families you
[02:21] know even uh before that in the in the
[02:24] 59 when Fidel Castro took over uh a lot
[02:28] of people came here uh including my
[02:31] grandfather so my grandfather came uh in
[02:33] 1959 when Castro took over um he claimed
[02:38] us you know that's how it got to this
[02:40] country uh legally because he he claimed
[02:42] my mother and therefore the the family
[02:45] nucleus so that the whole process took
[02:47] about five to six years once he started
[02:50] the the the legal process to clance but
[02:53] we were a pretty I mean pretty common
[02:56] poor family you know my man my mom had a
[02:59] job he was a director of a local Town
[03:02] Museum my dad was um um like a
[03:07] supervisor manager for a small company
[03:09] in the town it was a small
[03:11] town and pretty you know pretty regular
[03:16] lifestyle you know not too much to eat
[03:19] just thinking uh what are we going to
[03:21] eat today uh clothes what what clothes
[03:25] am I going to use I'm just waiting for
[03:27] the monthly uh $50 my uh grandfather
[03:31] used to send us sometimes it would take
[03:33] two three months without anything and
[03:35] that will help us get through um because
[03:36] the salary there at that time uh we're
[03:38] talking about 2002 um 2 yeah 2001 2002
[03:43] um it was like five bucks $ar uh a month
[03:47] uh converted when you converted the CU
[03:49] pesos to to the US dollars at that time
[03:53] it was pretty bad I remember all of that
[03:55] you know so I was very excited to have
[03:57] friends and family so
[04:00] in these countries cuz they usually were
[04:02] the one who got the best clothes the
[04:04] best food because of the things that
[04:06] they used to send us so to me I the
[04:08] United States was the saving vote you
[04:11] know it was like oh my God we're going
[04:12] to go to the United States finally we're
[04:14] going to get out of this you know so I
[04:17] was starting at the time I was
[04:18] 16 and over the um service the military
[04:23] services mandatory for everybody uh
[04:26] under 17 so they gave me a little bit of
[04:29] of a hard time to come to this country
[04:32] um because I was just turned 17 at the
[04:34] time so we had to pay a lot of people
[04:38] pretty much um for them to release me
[04:42] officially so my mom and sister had to
[04:45] come earlier because my my grandfather
[04:47] was very sick at the time and they were
[04:50] afraid we were going to lose the claim
[04:52] you know what I'm saying because if we
[04:53] waited for me they waited for me uh
[04:55] pretty much if my grandfather died
[04:57] before that everything was going to be
[04:59] uh finish ended so they had to leave me
[05:02] my mom and dad and my sister left uh a
[05:06] month and a half before me and my d uh
[05:08] came here because of the issue with the
[05:10] um military the mandatory military they
[05:13] call it uh service over there military
[05:15] service so finally we went through the
[05:18] connections and the pain the people you
[05:21] know how communist countries uh work and
[05:24] they finally uh released me and allow me
[05:27] to come to to the country a month and a
[05:29] half later after my mom and dad so
[05:32] that's how we came here you know but
[05:34] pretty much all you know very common
[05:36] poor family the struggling of a daily
[05:39] day you know not a lot of cloth
[05:42] sometimes I couldn't go to my friends uh
[05:45] Keras because I didn't have the clothes
[05:48] to go so that kind of mentality it was a
[05:50] it was and I'm very grateful for that
[05:53] extremely grateful cuz because of that I
[05:55] had the mindset and I develop the
[05:57] mindset cuz once I I came to this
[06:00] country and saw the uh amount of
[06:02] opportunities that we had in this
[06:05] country I was like I would never want to
[06:07] be that guy again or I would never want
[06:09] to be that family again so I really
[06:11] tried my best so that's how I came to
[06:13] this country I was claimed by my
[06:15] grandfather via um my
[06:18] mom and you know we all came here when I
[06:21] was 17 and thank God I went to school I
[06:24] studied I became a register
[06:26] nurse uh because at the time I was
[06:29] working in a hospital as a security
[06:32] guard and all my friends were pretty
[06:34] much nurses you know uh I used to work
[06:37] in the emergency was a security guard in
[06:38] a local hospital here and they were all
[06:41] like oh you should do this you should do
[06:42] that you should become a cup and they're
[06:44] like no you should become a nurse and I
[06:47] was like a nurse interesting so then the
[06:50] 2008 um financial crisis came and I
[06:55] saw uh a bunch of people losing their
[06:57] jobs but and interesting observation
[07:00] that I had was like in the hker field a
[07:03] lot of people remain employed especially
[07:07] the
[07:08] nurses because there was a need you know
[07:11] so it was like that moment where I was
[07:13] like I think you should go to nursing
[07:15] it's pretty much um fireproof when it
[07:19] comes to uh Financial uh
[07:22] instability because I saw different
[07:24] other um Services cops being fired
[07:28] firefighters being fired uh Bankers Etc
[07:33] around me you know friends you listen to
[07:34] stories but then working at a hospital I
[07:38] realized that they they were not doing
[07:40] they were not getting promotions they
[07:42] were not getting Races they were not
[07:44] getting uh maybe overtime but they were
[07:47] not touched the nurses so I was like
[07:49] maybe I should look into this just in
[07:52] case this ever happens again I have job
[07:55] security and that's you know why I
[07:58] became a nurse and
[08:01] I've I've always was curious I was
[08:04] always curious about you know always
[08:07] wanted wanted to make money you know we
[08:09] all we all do somehow though I told uh
[08:12] Paulo in the previous uh interview my my
[08:14] parents they join a multi-level
[08:17] marketing company I don't know if you
[08:18] are familiar with Amway and at that time
[08:22] they used to give all these
[08:24] self-development
[08:25] books and one of those books was the
[08:28] Robert kosaki uh that poor dad my I
[08:32] remember my dad taking that book to to
[08:33] the house he W Spanish uh Spanish uh
[08:36] translation and I started reading it out
[08:38] of curiosity because also I was U you
[08:40] know getting started in social media and
[08:42] I saw a lot of people talking about it
[08:45] and Robert kagi was a big name and that
[08:48] book completely changed my mindset you
[08:50] know that's that's when I understood
[08:52] that we are wasting our time working for
[08:56] for money for Fiat and that we needed to
[08:58] do something and that's when Real Estate
[09:00] came into to play uh a big part of me CU
[09:04] I was like I'm going to go into real
[09:07] estate this is the way to to go Robert
[09:10] kiag did it I have friends um who's
[09:13] doing uh pretty good pretty well in real
[09:15] estate with rentals and I saw the
[09:17] positive side the beautiful side about
[09:19] real estate which is what everybody
[09:21] talks about you know the rentals the
[09:23] cash flow but then nobody talks about
[09:26] the downside which is dealing with um
[09:29] tenants all the time breaking things not
[09:33] taking care of the property and besides
[09:36] this I've been working at at a full-time
[09:39] so I started my real estate Journey
[09:42] always trying to get out of the r race
[09:44] that was a get that was always a goal
[09:45] you know following Robert kosaki advice
[09:48] get out of the r race but I never wanted
[09:51] to be a Trader I never wanted to be uh
[09:55] to speculate in the market but the
[09:58] system is so
[09:59] uh how can I say up and I'm sorry
[10:03] if I if I if I'm cursing but so
[10:05] up that it makes you do these things
[10:08] even if you don't want to right if you
[10:10] want to get out of the r race it forces
[10:13] you to speculate it forces you to take
[10:16] risk and I all I wanted to do was get a
[10:20] little bit of money save it I learned
[10:22] the the the habit of saving you know
[10:25] early in life without that same mindset
[10:27] of I don't want to go back to that
[10:29] um family that poor family that poor kid
[10:32] how do I get out so I started saving
[10:34] anything that came in um for me I used
[10:37] always put something aside and I feel
[10:39] like a lot of people feel feel that way
[10:42] they just want to work save the money so
[10:45] they can enjoy later in life but the
[10:47] system is so up that it forces
[10:50] you to even if you're a
[10:53] Savor you know you realize that your
[10:55] money every year bites you less and less
[10:58] and less so and that happened to me and
[10:59] I saw it I was like wait a minute so I'm
[11:02] going to start trading I'm going to
[11:04] start doing this I don't want to do that
[11:06] I just want to save I just want to go to
[11:08] go to work come back home save a little
[11:11] every two weeks and hopefully retire
[11:13] with a bigger nest and enjoy my time but
[11:17] that formula is no longer uh a good
[11:19] formula to follow it's it's definitely
[11:22] it's not working it hasn't worked for a
[11:24] while and I realized that and we're
[11:27] talking early um I found Bitcoin so I
[11:30] went into my real estate
[11:32] Journey um was lucky enough to get a
[11:35] couple properties at a decent price
[11:38] compared to what it is now and rent rent
[11:41] them out I do um I do have a couple
[11:43] airbnbs at the
[11:45] moment and because I was able to get a
[11:47] good deal at the time these properties
[11:50] are cash flowing but dealing with
[11:52] tenants dealing with guesses to me I
[11:56] this is my personal opinion it's really
[11:59] time consuming and it's eating up my
[12:02] mental health because I don't want to
[12:03] deal with them honestly I think I pay my
[12:06] dues I already I'm on another level
[12:09] where I just I want to have a peace of
[12:11] mind I want to enjoy my family I have a
[12:13] little daughter I want to enjoy my
[12:15] family and just focus on the future for
[12:18] her for us and I don't want to I don't
[12:21] want to deal with any of that so that
[12:23] been my journey pretty much I don't know
[12:25] if you saw Paulo's uh interview but
[12:28] started the trading in the 2020 uh with
[12:30] the covid thanks to um the situation
[12:35] back then everybody was a great
[12:37] Trader you would buy literally buy
[12:39] anything and put a a limit sell a few
[12:42] minutes later and make two three hundred
[12:43] bucks with a ice clothes so but then I
[12:47] learned my lesson that you know it was
[12:49] just a face and when I found Bitcoin
[12:53] that I really want
[12:54] deeper I was like this is it this is
[12:57] that saving technology
[12:59] that I was always looking for something
[13:02] that I could just go and put whatever I
[13:04] don't need at the moment whatever Fe I
[13:06] don't need at the moment uh to eat to
[13:09] pay for my roof and just put it aside
[13:11] and forget about it and it it will just
[13:13] throw over there and put all these
[13:15] dollars to work for me and that's how I
[13:17] see it pretty much there's a lot of way
[13:19] to see Bitcoin because it's Bitcoin
[13:22] really has different um I would say
[13:26] um faces you know know you can see
[13:29] Bitcoin as many different things uh to
[13:32] me the saving technology aspect of it is
[13:36] is key and also the decentral aspect on
[13:39] it because with stocks I realized when I
[13:42] was trading
[13:43] stocks and even the good ones you know
[13:46] the Teslas and the Googles and all that
[13:50] it's so centralized it's so manipulated
[13:53] all this insid of trading that you
[13:57] pretty much don't have a chance chance
[14:00] even they're pretty good company and
[14:01] they're still
[14:03] growing I don't want to feel I don't
[14:05] want to feel that I need to sit down
[14:06] every 3 months and listen to this um uh
[14:09] quarterly uh calls and see what they're
[14:12] trying to do or accomplish or if they
[14:14] had a meet up with China or or they had
[14:18] a meet up with a current president and
[14:20] they decided to do this change or
[14:21] suddenly W wake up tomorrow on another
[14:24] policy change or whatever me personally
[14:26] I don't want to deal with that you know
[14:28] some people love that
[14:29] I just want to have something that I
[14:31] know I'm going to put aside and in 10 15
[14:35] years it will grow and I didn't have to
[14:37] do anything about it because it's meant
[14:40] to be the best saving technology of the
[14:43] world that's pretty much it I love yeah
[14:47] I love the story it's a really it's a
[14:49] really good one and I'm I mean you
[14:52] already dropped some some lessons and
[14:55] some things that that you learn along
[14:56] the way but like I'm really curious of
[14:58] like you traded you came from Cuba you
[15:02] you cross country lines uh you uh went
[15:05] into real estate now you're in Bitcoin
[15:08] so you you you read the Robert kosaki
[15:11] which is a really good book I did love
[15:13] it also what have you learned uh in in
[15:17] your history in in your path do from
[15:20] like Kuba to up until here about money
[15:24] like how did how did this all shape your
[15:26] view and your understanding what what
[15:28] money is well one of the things
[15:32] uh my parents were too uh they both went
[15:35] to school um they were uh both
[15:38] professional and I saw these two
[15:40] professionals struggling in life in Cuba
[15:43] and I was wonder why uh two
[15:45] professionals you know with degrees were
[15:47] always struggling in this country right
[15:50] which is a communist countes where they
[15:52] always had issues with money money was
[15:54] always a topic not in a good sense in a
[15:57] bad sense like we don't have money for
[15:58] that oh we don't have money for that oh
[16:00] we cannot go there cuz we don't have
[16:01] money for that so that always stuck in
[16:05] my mind you know like why what's going
[16:07] on that these people two professionals
[16:09] they they did what they're supposed to
[16:10] do they went to school they study
[16:12] they're not criminals they're
[16:14] not um trying to hurt anybody and still
[16:17] the struggling was going on then I
[16:20] realized that especially when I started
[16:24] when I came to this country that I had
[16:25] more access to uh technology books
[16:28] podcasts Etc cuz in Cuba I don't have
[16:30] any of that we didn't have internet we
[16:32] didn't have phones cell phones or
[16:34] anything like that it was pretty much TV
[16:36] two channels two government channels it
[16:38] is what it is they put whatever they
[16:40] want want you to see over there uh
[16:43] usually Pro
[16:45] socialism so you're very close-minded
[16:48] you know um and once I came here and I
[16:52] pretty much open that Pandora box of
[16:55] information things started to click for
[16:57] me I was was oh sense now Cuba is a very
[17:01] poor country uh unfortunately because of
[17:05] the administration there is so
[17:06] centralized in this uh communist count
[17:09] uh government that they they don't allow
[17:13] the city citizens to thrive you know I
[17:16] believe Cubans are very um very
[17:19] hardworking people super smart people
[17:22] because because of the conditions that
[17:24] we are uh lived we have to improvise so
[17:27] the Cuban is the the the type of guy
[17:29] that he will try to make something out
[17:31] of nothing pretty much and that's how
[17:35] you live over there
[17:37] unfortunately always trying to find uh
[17:40] today you know you leave pretty much day
[17:42] by day what are we going to do today
[17:44] what am going to sell how am I going to
[17:45] trade with a a fellow a Cuban either
[17:49] we're going to change it's funny because
[17:52] we're living we were living in two in
[17:53] the 2000s and and you see people B and
[17:57] and and and trade between among them no
[18:00] money like hey give me a little bit of
[18:02] sugar I'll give you coffee um because
[18:04] maybe you have more sugar than me and I
[18:05] have more coffee and and we we can trade
[18:07] that oh let me have some meat I have
[18:09] some eggs because I I I have a chicken
[18:12] you have some some uh porks you know and
[18:16] they live like that and probably um I
[18:18] haven't been to Cuba in a while but it's
[18:20] I heard is pretty worse than it used to
[18:22] be well always see my mom my mom and dad
[18:25] struggling with a money aspect uh I came
[18:29] here and they always told me go to
[18:31] school they all say go to school become
[18:33] somebody get a good job that's it but
[18:37] realize it's not it's not enough it's
[18:40] not enough you can like in my um uh
[18:44] industry Healthcare um I work with a a
[18:48] bunch of professionals nurse
[18:50] practitioners doctors and they're pretty
[18:53] Mo much
[18:55] struggling
[18:57] because you listen to their stories and
[18:59] they have a full time plus a part-time
[19:02] or they have a full time and another
[19:03] full time or the wife has a parttime and
[19:07] you know so I'm like how this
[19:09] professionals it kind of brings me back
[19:11] to my old um self when I was in Cuba I'm
[19:14] like we are professionals and I got to
[19:17] be honest to you Robin if I didn't buy
[19:19] my house I'm currently where I'm
[19:21] currently live at the moment that I did
[19:25] I would I wouldn't be able to afford
[19:26] home today this is just the reality of
[19:29] it and me and my wife we both
[19:31] professionals but the prices of houses
[19:33] are so high here in Miami and a lot of
[19:36] places around the US that I could tell
[19:39] you with certainty I could not have I
[19:43] could not afford a decent house in a
[19:46] decent neighborhood with my salary and
[19:50] my wife's salary so when you put
[19:53] everything together my background in
[19:55] Cuba my struggles in Cuba coming here
[19:58] see my mom and dad working uh hard and
[20:02] not getting anywhere you start putting
[20:04] pieces together and then you start
[20:07] realizing that it's all a big huge scam
[20:11] you know and then finally we have this
[20:14] beautiful technology um that all you got
[20:17] to do is take a little bit of time to
[20:19] study and learn and you realize that now
[20:22] you have an opportunity
[20:24] to if you want to retire you don't have
[20:27] to retire that late you know and wait
[20:30] for that social security check that we
[20:32] just realized is being a scammed all
[20:34] this time so that's pretty much it how I
[20:38] put everything together my story with
[20:40] Cuba and and the United States the Fiat
[20:43] virus is a global virus uh unfortunately
[20:47] it doesn't matter what country Austria
[20:49] for you um United States Germany
[20:54] Australia it does not matter uh what
[20:57] country it is it's just
[20:59] a decaying um a decaying technology to
[21:03] save your money and and we have to value
[21:06] our time a little bit more because at
[21:07] the end of the day it comes down to that
[21:09] our time our time that we have here that
[21:12] we think when we're younger we have
[21:14] enough because we don't think about that
[21:16] too much but as you get older you
[21:19] realize it's so precious you know my
[21:22] little time with my daughter my time
[21:23] with my wife my with my parents is so
[21:26] precious that the job the Fiat job does
[21:29] not allow you to enjoy those moments
[21:32] which are really the uh the fruit of
[21:34] your labor if if you want to see it that
[21:36] way you know because why do we work so
[21:38] much unfortunately a lot of people get
[21:40] into the the cons consumer mindset and
[21:43] you just want to buy stuff to feel
[21:45] better for a little bit which is the um
[21:48] that immediate
[21:49] gratification uh Sensation that oh I'm
[21:52] happy because I just got this new car or
[21:54] we just bought a bigger house but you
[21:56] realize that's always
[21:59] is Never Enough you're always trying to
[22:01] get more and more and more and I think
[22:03] Bitcoin helps you to realize that those
[22:07] things are so frivolous you know and yes
[22:10] we do like good things I like to drive a
[22:13] nice car but if I have to choose I'm at
[22:15] at this point in my life I have to
[22:16] choose a nice car versus quality time
[22:20] with my family I will take quality time
[22:23] 100 100 times before the watch the car
[22:27] the purse the SHO shoes Etc and and
[22:30] that's where I'm at right now in my life
[22:32] you know I just want to have enough time
[22:35] to spend with them for as much as I can
[22:37] you know for as long as I can I love
[22:40] that and and I want to there's so much
[22:44] in there but I want to first uh dive a
[22:47] little bit into you coming to America
[22:50] and one thing you said about it is like
[22:53] you had only you had no phone you no
[22:55] internet no radio just like two channels
[22:57] and it was government channels how was
[23:00] it for you to come here and all of the
[23:03] sudden have
[23:05] every like have so much overflow of
[23:09] information and maybe now even greater
[23:13] now of like having chat gbd in this AI
[23:16] tools of like like literally you want to
[23:18] know something and research something
[23:20] like it's it's literally done in like a
[23:21] minute and you you're you're better
[23:23] informed like uh in a few years ago when
[23:26] you had to sit through books how was
[23:28] that transition from like having no
[23:29] information to like getting to this
[23:31] Wonderland of information well I I mean
[23:34] it pretty much
[23:36] changed it pretty much changed your life
[23:39] so fast you know it's fascinating
[23:42] because from
[23:43] coming no information no cell phone just
[23:47] an old phone in the house that you used
[23:49] to uh make phone calls to some friends
[23:52] here and there one TV entire house just
[23:55] sitting in the living room and now you
[23:57] have to wait for your dad or your mom to
[23:59] allow you to watch some TV because you
[24:02] know if they're watching something some
[24:03] news that they're interested in you
[24:05] pretty much don't have anything else you
[24:06] have to find other ways of um other
[24:09] forms of entertainment so coming from
[24:12] that and suddenly coming to this country
[24:14] where now there's a couple TVs I was
[24:17] stay initially in my grand grandfather's
[24:19] house and we have like two three TV so
[24:22] suddenly I see like two three TVs I'm
[24:25] like wow this is this is incredible you
[24:28] know my life I've been brought up to
[24:30] just watching One TV I two channels and
[24:34] suddenly I have all this 100 plus
[24:36] channels um news movies uh cartoons
[24:42] anything that I want it was it was just
[24:43] a mindblown I didn't have a cell phone
[24:45] at the beginning of course my mom and
[24:48] dad couldn't afford uh to get me a cell
[24:50] phone so right after I came I was 17 so
[24:53] we came in with a residence status and I
[24:56] was able to find a job really quick near
[24:58] nearby the house that I was staying uh
[25:00] my grand grandfather's house and it was
[25:03] an ice cream shop and it was a parttime
[25:07] uh I was going to high school and then
[25:09] after high school I go to this ice cream
[25:11] shop
[25:12] to work and get my initial um money so I
[25:17] saved a lot you know that little money
[25:19] little little little by little I was
[25:20] able to open and um to get a line to get
[25:23] a a phone back then it was not a
[25:26] smartphone I don't know I don't know in
[25:28] your country but um in 2002 2003 we had
[25:32] just those flip flip phones but little
[25:35] by little you start getting you know the
[25:38] the news or uh or the information from
[25:42] the uh from the TV your phone your
[25:45] friends to start talking about something
[25:47] you had access to computers I didn't
[25:50] have a computer initially either but as
[25:51] soon as I could I bought my first laptop
[25:54] it was I think a reusable uh laptop uh
[25:57] from somebody else but now I had access
[25:59] to Internet and now I had access to you
[26:02] know YouTube and Google was pretty much
[26:05] not a big deal back then either so but
[26:08] again you you open up these
[26:11] um kind of uh doors to a lot of new
[26:14] information where you never had that so
[26:16] you become more curious because now
[26:19] you're like from not having anything to
[26:21] having so much I want to know about
[26:23] everything pretty much so you want to
[26:25] know about the news you want to know
[26:26] about the latest uh Trend you want to
[26:29] know about what your friend is talking
[26:31] about so you have a way of finding out a
[26:33] little bit more and Technology here
[26:36] develops so so fast that everything just
[26:38] come at once pretty much because the the
[26:40] more time you are consuming all this
[26:43] information the more you find out that
[26:45] there more um tools out there to give
[26:48] you more information so I switch my
[26:50] little flip flop flip uh phones to a
[26:52] more um modern phone and that way you
[26:54] start getting up to to speed with the
[26:57] technology then you get your smartphone
[26:59] your your your your Apple phone and now
[27:01] you have all this technology in the palm
[27:03] of your of your hand and just with a
[27:05] click you can Google something and
[27:07] search for it and and later the later
[27:11] the latest thing is the AI is it's just
[27:13] change uh so much our life it's it's
[27:17] incredible uh I use it I use it a lot my
[27:20] wife I use it a lot cuz she works in a
[27:24] in a place that um she has to make
[27:26] reports on a daily basis and it's just
[27:30] it's like having a personal assistant
[27:32] pretty much it's just incredible how
[27:34] fast um technology develops and and how
[27:38] fast we have to evolve with it we don't
[27:41] want to stay behind so I encourage
[27:44] everybody to um you know um adapt to the
[27:48] new technologies AI is one of them and
[27:52] apply it to your daily daily activities
[27:54] if you can but yeah it was a pretty
[27:57] interesting
[27:58] transformation from not having anything
[28:01] to having everything I want pretty much
[28:04] and the good thing I always been a a
[28:07] curious open-minded person so to me it
[28:11] was just easy to adapt to all this new
[28:14] forms of technology and information it
[28:16] was pretty pretty easy to to be part of
[28:19] it and and and put it to work towards my
[28:23] goals and to help me um to become a
[28:27] better person
[28:28] so was an e transition to be honest I
[28:32] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[28:35] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece

[30:38] minute free call to find out how you can
[30:41] level up your sovereignty it's super
[30:44] interesting with the technology because
[30:45] there's like in every technology wave
[30:48] there are people that are early
[30:50] adopters uh then there's like the the
[30:53] majority that of people that come and
[30:55] then they even like late adopters that
[30:57] kind of sleep on technology they they
[31:00] think that technology whatever it is is
[31:03] bad or they don't want to do deal with
[31:06] it and they didn't have a really huge
[31:09] disadvantage against the other ones and
[31:12] uh you saw that with like search engine
[31:14] with Google uh you saw that in I think
[31:18] um paying for ads is one of the Prime
[31:21] examples for that where at some point tv
[31:25] ads worked really good then Google came
[31:27] along then Google was really way better
[31:30] bang for your buck uh um in terms of
[31:33] like TV ad versus Google search uh um
[31:36] ads then like social media came along
[31:39] and and like all those things and we
[31:42] could go in like so many different
[31:43] Industries and it it it's fascinating
[31:46] how this technology adopts and you kind
[31:49] of have to adopt with it as fast as
[31:52] possible and figure out what are the
[31:55] technologies that um are worth to
[31:58] adopting because there's always
[32:00] technology that kind of flops like for
[32:02] example Blu-ray is one of my favorite
[32:04] examples of like like people thought
[32:07] it's the future and then it was like
[32:09] gone because like digital came along and
[32:12] and kind of was like replacing blr
[32:14] completely and making it irrelevant I I
[32:16] don't know 100% where I'm going with
[32:18] this question but um how fast do you
[32:22] think it will happen with
[32:25] Bitcoin that people are actually too
[32:29] late like people think nowadays they're
[32:31] still too already too late to bitcoin
[32:33] but now it's it's not too late we're
[32:36] still so early on on the adoption side
[32:38] and on the adoption curve but but how
[32:41] fast do you think will this window off
[32:43] opportunity in Bitcoin close what do you
[32:47] think is the like the the the time frame
[32:50] for the the late major and for for the
[32:53] people that really have to pay a high
[32:54] price for getting few SS yeah that's a
[32:57] really really really good question uh
[33:00] personally I experienced this at work uh
[33:03] a couple times before because I try to I
[33:06] try to orange pill my my co-workers uh
[33:09] especially since I know they have one
[33:12] job on a part-time or two jobs sometimes
[33:14] or they're looking for that extra
[33:16] overtime and I try to tell them about
[33:19] Bitcoin and how early we still are but
[33:21] at the same time I give them a little
[33:23] bit urgency because even though we are
[33:25] early and
[33:28] Bitcoins when you compare Bitcoin to all
[33:31] the other Tech Technologies and assets
[33:33] uh extremely early only since 2009 um
[33:38] there's something and and this is I'm
[33:39] paying attention to on a daily basis
[33:41] every day that I wake up there's at
[33:45] least at least two three bullish news
[33:48] about Bitcoin either regarding
[33:51] adoption new company adopting uh a new
[33:55] billionaire adopting
[33:57] and it's like this in my mind it's just
[34:00] this domino effect H at one point you
[34:04] know you see this the first two three
[34:06] dominoes but at one point you're just
[34:09] going to see a vast uh space of dominoes
[34:13] and you won't won't be able to to tell
[34:15] how many domino are falling because it's
[34:18] so big and I'm I'm I think even though
[34:21] we're early because we are extremely
[34:23] early the next phase the first 10 years
[34:27] were
[34:28] slow for Bitcoin adoption a slow in a
[34:32] sense like you know it took a little bit
[34:33] of time people to realize it we still I
[34:36] mean the majority of my friends don't
[34:39] understand what Bitcoin is they don't
[34:40] even talk about it so that tells you we
[34:42] still early but at the same time we
[34:45] people like you and me that are in the
[34:47] space seeing what's
[34:49] happening I think the next 10 years are
[34:51] going to
[34:52] be the adoption rate is going to be way
[34:56] faster than the past 10
[34:58] years at least by 10x at least by 10x
[35:03] all these countries talking about it all
[35:04] these companies adopting it day by day
[35:07] you see news one after the other
[35:10] ones uh it's just going to be a very s
[35:14] face the next 10 years I Believe by
[35:18] 2030 by 2030 I mean I I want to I want
[35:23] to think by 2030 you're going to be a
[35:25] little bit late to bitcoin to be honest
[35:28] if you're a regular ple like me you know
[35:31] just doing your thing working and trying
[35:33] to survive and and make a better leing
[35:36] for your family $1,000 uh is not going
[35:39] to buy you enough sets and and you can
[35:43] you can take it you can um see it as a
[35:46] bitcoin price uh denomination or you can
[35:48] see it also as a rate of return
[35:51] denomination and we can think about your
[35:53] rate of return in in 2030 was going to
[35:56] be compared to now
[35:58] it's still is gonna I think I think it's
[36:00] still going to be the best uh performing
[36:03] asset in the next 5 10 years I have no
[36:06] doubt so but when it comes to having
[36:11] enough
[36:13] to to say that you are that level of
[36:16] where you can have a nice retirement and
[36:20] still don't wait until you're
[36:22] 6560 and make really lifechanging uh
[36:25] decisions based on the amount of big
[36:27] coin I think it's getting late for a lot
[36:29] of people I think now um below 100,000
[36:33] we still can get a pretty decent amount
[36:36] of Bitcoin you just got to grind hard
[36:39] and and and try to get as much as you
[36:42] can but the next five to 10 years in my
[36:46] opinion if you if you're don't if you're
[36:47] not acting um a little aggressive now
[36:51] you're going to be a little bit late uh
[36:54] a little bit late in my in my opinion
[36:57] you're going to miss a lot you're going
[36:58] to miss a lot because the more adoption
[37:02] that we get the faster it's going to
[37:05] feel and the next phase is not going to
[37:09] wait for for you to to stack as much uh
[37:12] Bitcoin now since we have this this
[37:15] great opportunity sub 100 uh Cas so I
[37:20] try to pound the table to to a close
[37:22] closest friends and and family members
[37:25] uh Unfortunately they still
[37:28] don't think about it that way uh they
[37:30] don't see it they just focus on the
[37:33] price oh it's $100,000 it's I'm too late
[37:36] and I try to tell them that it's not
[37:39] because of the adoption the percent the
[37:41] percentage of user that he has um you
[37:44] know try to change the the the the the
[37:47] to shift the view on them so they don't
[37:50] Focus so much on the um on the um dollar
[37:54] uh price of Bitcoin and they try they
[37:56] try to understand it uh as a technology
[38:00] that is still early and and with every
[38:03] early technology you still have a great
[38:05] upside um um for you on your side but
[38:09] it's hard it's hard
[38:11] to it's hard because
[38:13] people don't want to take the time in my
[38:16] opinion they don't want to take the time
[38:18] to study they're so immersed in the
[38:20] daily in the daily um habit a daily um
[38:25] job or daily problems
[38:27] that once you tell them they have to
[38:29] take some time to study this thing it's
[38:32] like oh I'm wasting my time because they
[38:34] don't understand it that's been my my
[38:37] case um unfortunately I don't know um
[38:40] about you in your case but in my case
[38:42] people pretty much once you tell them
[38:44] they need to put a little bit of time to
[38:46] study this thing they pretty much stop
[38:49] and they're like I don't want to waste
[38:51] my time doing that you know but um I got
[38:54] I got some pretty good uh friends on
[38:56] board
[38:58] they finally G gave it a chance it's
[39:01] funny how they didn't give it a chance
[39:02] when he was 16 but now 90 and 100
[39:06] they're they're more interested um but
[39:09] it's good it's good because um at the
[39:11] end of the day we all agree on something
[39:16] and this is how I start my conversations
[39:18] uh with them that our time is energy and
[39:22] we're wasting our time and energy on
[39:24] something that has no value we all agree
[39:27] on that
[39:28] you know we have to find this common
[39:30] common uh ground before we start talking
[39:32] about what's the solution and and that's
[39:36] how I start my conversations with them
[39:37] you know once they start telling me
[39:39] about this and that you're like why are
[39:41] you have why why professional like you
[39:43] have two jobs three jobs to keep up with
[39:47] the same life lifestyle that you had
[39:48] three four five years ago you know have
[39:51] you thought about that and they're like
[39:53] oh yeah that's right I don't realize it
[39:54] because I'm so busy but you're 100%
[39:57] right
[39:57] three years ago I only had one job and I
[40:00] still you know was able to afford the
[40:02] same car that I'm driving today and I I
[40:05] was able to afford the same styles of
[40:07] rent that I'm that I have today but now
[40:10] wow you just made me realize I haven't
[40:12] changed my lifestyle too much I haven't
[40:14] upgraded my lifetime I still have to
[40:16] work more and then once we found that
[40:18] ground that Common Ground then I started
[40:20] talking a little bit more about savings
[40:22] about this what strategy what strategy
[40:24] are you using but definitely that window
[40:27] is closing really fast because I see it
[40:30] every day I wake up every day robbing
[40:32] and and it's just bullish bullish news
[40:35] one after the other one so I feel the
[40:38] urgency even for myself I'm like I
[40:41] better hurry because this thing is gonna
[40:43] I do believe is we're gonna have a
[40:47] huge green
[40:49] candle you know this thing is just
[40:52] taking a little break and I one day we
[40:55] want to wake up and we're going to see
[40:57] this candle even people that are
[40:59] expecting the candle were are going to
[41:00] be
[41:02] surprised you know so it's coming it's
[41:06] just a matter of time Bitcoin you know
[41:09] that's what he does the the time that
[41:11] you least expected is gonna just blow in
[41:14] your face and you're like oh
[41:15]  that's it's amazing yeah
[41:19] and there so many Al in there this is
[41:23] like what do you think why is it so hard
[41:27] for people to to get orange pill now it
[41:31] it's like most people that are now let's
[41:34] say um 30 to like 40 to like 50 years
[41:38] old they have seen Bitcoin dollar they
[41:43] have seen it probably even like at 5,000
[41:45] they've seen it at 50,000 and they have
[41:47] seen it at 100,000 they may might even
[41:50] have seen it as at
[41:52] $100 um at some point you like okay it
[41:56] goes up to $100 it goes up to a th000
[41:59] and you're like okay it's a little bit
[42:01] over valued um I I don't want to buy
[42:04] like it's back live all all those things
[42:06] that you have in your mind but then it
[42:08] goes down maybe and you like feel a
[42:10] little bit confirmed but then it goes up
[42:12] again to 10,000 and then it's like okay
[42:15] now it's definitely too high and but at
[42:18] some point you have to admit that maybe
[42:21] it's you that are wrong that is wrong
[42:23] and and maybe you have to research a
[42:26] little bit what's going
[42:28] on so I'm I'm always wondering like why
[42:31] why don't more people get it and more
[42:33] people uh wake up what do you think
[42:35] needs to happen for for more people to
[42:37] wake up is it purely price action that
[42:40] like okay once we rip to a million bunch
[42:42] of new people will get it or like uh is
[42:46] there maybe some fear event or do we
[42:49] just need better education is there
[42:51] something that maybe also bitcoiners
[42:53] could do to accelerate the the trend
[42:56] yeah so um to your
[42:58] question a lot of people especially in
[43:00] the US I have to tell you about us
[43:03] because this is my experience here and
[43:05] the people that I surround myself with
[43:08] they're so busy on the dayto day they're
[43:11] so busy that they just want to get home
[43:14] eat something and watch a movie and try
[43:17] to relax they don't want to think about
[43:19] money they don't want to and the the
[43:22] system itself is is is is made up in a
[43:26] in a sense to to make you think like
[43:28] that like don't think about money be a
[43:30] slave all your life we need to stop
[43:33] questioning what we've done for the past
[43:36] thousands of years CU you just a little
[43:39] sheep you know follow the Sheep just be
[43:42] a little sheep go to work come back home
[43:44] wake up the next morning do the same
[43:46] thing and just do that for 60 40 years
[43:48] whatever it is that you need to do it
[43:50] for my experience with my friends
[43:53] colleagues is that they're so busy
[43:55] they're so tired they don't want to
[43:57] think about it they just want to go make
[44:00] that little extra money go home take a
[44:03] shower eat something watch a movie
[44:05] repeat again so there has to be a reset
[44:10] especially in education you know even
[44:13] though we PLS bitcoiners are try to uh
[44:16] pound the table and tell everybody that
[44:18] we
[44:19] know that's not going to be enough
[44:22] that's not going to be enough because I
[44:23] think they have to be in resetting
[44:25] education and start thinking and I start
[44:27] teaching young kids about what money is
[44:30] where it comes from so um there has to
[44:34] be a major reform in in education mayor
[44:37] like total reset and I really hope now
[44:41] with this new
[44:42] Administration that has a a lot of
[44:45] bitcoiners as spot of it there's a maor
[44:48] reform that we start teaching not
[44:51] necessarily about Bitcoin so much but if
[44:54] you can just teach about what money is
[44:56] how it's created how it's printed how it
[44:59] has no value uh give the the the new
[45:02] generation the tools to make those
[45:04] decisions for the themselves but at
[45:07] least teaching about Finance about
[45:09] economics about taxes you know this
[45:12] major uh topics that pretty much run our
[45:15] lives because our lives once you become
[45:18] an adult you're not talking about social
[45:20] science or uh geometry pretty much our
[45:25] daily topics are taxes
[45:28] um
[45:29] insurance
[45:31] money uh
[45:33] overtime this that things that never
[45:37] heard in school never and and they still
[45:39] don't teach it in school so we have to
[45:41] start by doing that if we want to have
[45:43] mass really Mass adoption because once
[45:46] you give them the tools and the
[45:47] information about these
[45:50] topics eventually everybody's going to
[45:52] realize that Bitcoin is the thing is the
[45:55] answer you know
[45:57] and that's what I realize with my
[45:58] co-workers and colleagues they just
[46:01] decide to work make money and not even
[46:05] think about it go to work make money
[46:07] make make as much as you as you can
[46:10] don't even question how much goes to the
[46:12] IRS why it goes to the IRS why why you
[46:15] get double taxes in your property every
[46:17] year they increase they don't question
[46:19] any of this they're just like oh it went
[46:21] up I have to work more no problem let me
[46:23] find another job so and that's why I
[46:26] trying to
[46:27] tell my co-workers like learn about
[46:30] money study a little bit what it is why
[46:34] you work for this thing to begin with
[46:36] how come um your last five years has uh
[46:40] you have to increase your energy output
[46:43] uh to remain the same to to try to keep
[46:46] up with the same lifestyle you have five
[46:48] years ago have you questioned that have
[46:49] you have you thought about that and
[46:51] everybody the first thing they said is
[46:53] not no I haven't seen I haven't thought
[46:54] about it that way you know everything
[46:56] goes up and they expect it to go up
[46:58] because it's been like that forever it's
[47:00] like an expectation it's like it's okay
[47:03] for prices to go up year after year
[47:05] after year because they they don't
[47:07] realize that the system is is um
[47:10] up and and that's how I start my
[47:13] conversations definitely bitcoiners are
[47:15] doing a really good job um podcast like
[47:18] your and and and all these other the
[47:21] podcast to spread the word um there's a
[47:25] movement especially in uh in X about a
[47:29] bunch of pleps like me that are trying
[47:32] to Orange Peel one one or two people in
[47:35] their in their um Circle you know and
[47:38] that one or two we eventually get it in
[47:41] my case it's being like that even though
[47:42] it took a little longer for example my
[47:44] sister it took a few years for her to
[47:47] understand it but finally she's getting
[47:48] it because you know you always you don't
[47:51] give up on these people you know people
[47:52] that you know they deserve a better life
[47:55] um some other you give up you know these
[47:57] are the peop that you know you cannot
[47:59] reason with um but that's the beauty of
[48:01] it you know we not I always say we're
[48:03] not going to save everybody especially
[48:06] if they don't want to be safe some
[48:07] people H have it good some people have
[48:09] that job a high income and they don't
[48:12] really need it they don't really need to
[48:14] think about it you know they they able
[48:17] to make their payments their their car
[48:18] payments they already know they want to
[48:20] retire at 65 at 70 they already have a
[48:23] plan in place and they don't need it
[48:25] they don't need you to be they don't
[48:27] need to to listen to your to your theory
[48:29] on bitcoin because they have it good
[48:31] they have it well and that's okay some
[48:33] people do well in the fear in the fear
[48:36] world they're doing well in the fear
[48:38] world and and they won't need it but
[48:41] those people are going to come back I
[48:42] believe when they see Bitcoin at a a
[48:45] million dollars per coin and they'll be
[48:47] like they realize that they made a
[48:49] mistake because at the end of the day as
[48:51] human beings we all greedy and we always
[48:54] want more so the the guy that's telling
[48:56] you he's doing pretty good in the fat
[48:58] Fiat uh World eventually will come back
[49:01] to you and knock on your door and be
[49:02] like hey remember that Bitcoin that you
[49:04] talked about uh can tell me a little bit
[49:07] more it's at a million dollars now how
[49:09] come and that's another opportunity for
[49:12] you to to go ahead and orange bu that
[49:14] person who at that time was not ready
[49:17] mentally was not ready financially was
[49:19] was okay was doing well so he didn't
[49:21] need it at the time and that's what
[49:23] happens to a bunch of people they will
[49:25] all come back to it
[49:27] eventually so the adoption um it's going
[49:31] to increase I see it is increasing every
[49:34] day all these new companies adopting
[49:37] Bitcoin there are people watching and if
[49:40] we you watch closely to what happens to
[49:41] this company that adop Bitcoin there's a
[49:44] bunch of people that trading this
[49:45] company and they they're going to start
[49:47] as
[49:47] Traders looking for that
[49:50] extra um uh money and and that greed of
[49:53] the quick buck and they will start the
[49:56] they soon realize that Bitcoin because
[49:59] of Bitcoin that's why the company is
[50:01] doing as uh so good and now they're
[50:04] going to start starting Bitcoin a little
[50:06] bit more and you don't have to be all in
[50:08] in Bitcoin uh even though that's what I
[50:11] do and that's what I pach some people
[50:13] are okay having stocks but if you want
[50:16] to own any stocks now you may be better
[50:20] owning stocks that have their treasure
[50:23] in the Bitcoin you see So eventually
[50:25] everything is going to rolve about
[50:28] around the Bitcoin um in a way in a way
[50:32] or another one you know so you can have
[50:34] your spot Bitcoin be very bullish in
[50:36] that and just save your Fiat in Bitcoin
[50:40] or you can just try and trade companies
[50:44] that are on the Bitcoin standard and
[50:46] eventually they're performing so well
[50:48] that you no longer need to trade anymore
[50:50] because now you just became an investor
[50:52] on the company and that's the trend that
[50:54] I see you know all these companies that
[50:56] that are adopting the Bitcoin uh
[50:58] standard they're doing so well and
[51:01] everybody's looking at it you know
[51:03] everybody's
[51:04] watching um what is happening so
[51:08] everybody will come to it eventually
[51:11] that's uh is it's a good inside of
[51:14] like you want to onboard your loved ones
[51:18] like you want to onboard the people that
[51:19] are close to you that that you love that
[51:22] they love you uh those are the ones uh
[51:26] that you care about orange
[51:28] pilling the other ones you can also
[51:31] orange pill that like it's a good act to
[51:34] do it's good for I think Humanity um but
[51:38] they will come around it's just about
[51:41] like when when will they come around and
[51:44] you want your closed ones to come uh
[51:47] quick around and and your loved ones to
[51:49] come quick around so that that's that's
[51:51] something U very interesting also one
[51:54] thing um uh that that ask not often
[51:57] enough but I think you're the per
[51:59] perfect guest to ask that um uh I I will
[52:03] first ask a little bit of a different
[52:05] question and then come to the other one
[52:07] um why do you think socialism and
[52:10] communism
[52:11] won't are not a good idea and will not
[52:15] uh work well show me I mean I I would
[52:19] tell you to show me a place that
[52:20] socialism has worked and has Thrive and
[52:23] you see their citizen their citizen
[52:26] driving you just got to open your eyes
[52:27] and be honest with yourself you
[52:29] know I have not seen me personally I
[52:32] have not seen one socialist country and
[52:34] look at their citizens and their
[52:36] citizens are not struggling you take
[52:38] Venezuela for example such a rich
[52:41] country and so many
[52:45] resources you see Cuba is an island in
[52:48] the middle of the Caribbean Cuba could
[52:50] be the next El Salvador or Dubai of the
[52:54] Caribbean you know full of
[52:57] tourism and prosperity and it's just a
[53:00] dump unfortunately you know because I
[53:03] still have friends and still have a some
[53:06] relative and it's been like that for the
[53:09] past 50 60 years there's nothing
[53:12] improving nothing there has improved
[53:15] because of of Communism there's no one
[53:17] thing one metric that you can look at in
[53:20] a socialist country and say okay let's
[53:23] ignore economics Finance let's look at
[53:27] education it's terrible let's look at
[53:29] Healthcare whoever tells you that
[53:31] Healthcare in a Socialist Communist
[53:33] country is better than a capitalist
[53:35] country is full of you know you
[53:38] don't have the tools you don't have the
[53:40] resources to perform even if you have
[53:42] the knowledge if you have a really good
[53:44] amazing super smart doctor that knows
[53:47] what he's doing he does not have the
[53:50] tools to perform whatever it is that he
[53:52] needs to perform
[53:53] because the socialist country does not
[53:56] not
[53:57] allow for the community to thrive and to
[54:00] have the things that that are needed
[54:01] there not there's not competition
[54:03] there's not uh urge to get better to
[54:06] compete with my other business because
[54:09] there's no business whatever the
[54:10] government tells you it is what it is so
[54:14] those countries is is an idea at the end
[54:16] of the days uh if you're a socialist or
[54:18] a
[54:19] communist you're a very hypocritical
[54:22] person whoever is doing well is because
[54:24] it's well connected to the government
[54:26] and those people on
[54:28] top of course are doing well because
[54:31] they have access to that Fiat but the
[54:34] rest of the community and the rest of
[54:36] the the country is
[54:38] just they don't have any any hope to be
[54:41] honest you know is my experience is what
[54:44] I've seen and I really hope uh the Cuban
[54:48] people will adapt and I've seen a couple
[54:51] of friends already adopting the Bitcoin
[54:54] uh they're saving in Bitcoin whenever
[54:56] they have a chance they put the money
[54:58] their peso in Bitcoin or or the the
[55:00] Cuban um Dollar in Bitcoin because they
[55:04] see it and they understand it I don't
[55:07] know who told them um if now they have
[55:11] more access to Internet because some of
[55:13] them have cell phones they pay for Wi-Fi
[55:15] so they can see what's going on outside
[55:18] but at the time that I was in QA we
[55:19] didn't have any of that you know we have
[55:21] no communication to the outside world
[55:23] whatsoever so hopefully that Chang from
[55:26] the bottom up which is what Bitcoin is
[55:29] meant to be to to be given to the people
[55:32] from the bottom up and and that's what
[55:34] I've seen in Cuba uh with a few clubs
[55:38] Bitcoin clubs that are emerging in in
[55:41] some um places and they're spreading the
[55:45] the word you know and they see it's
[55:46] working their savings now at least they
[55:49] have hopes for a better future before it
[55:52] was just um no hope at all you know do
[55:55] you think coin because it kind of rips
[55:59] away the power for the government to to
[56:02] print money will prevent Concepts like
[56:05] communism and socialism uh in the in the
[56:09] long run to occur again or is is is that
[56:12] also possible with Bitcoin I think we
[56:14] with in the long run if you think about
[56:16] in the long run yes because as
[56:20] generation leaves a new generation comes
[56:23] we are changing the mindset of that new
[56:25] generations cuz they're seeing it um but
[56:29] it's going to take a long time so but
[56:32] you're always going to have that
[56:33] idealist who um you know is going to be
[56:39] against
[56:41] capitalism be either because somebody T
[56:44] taught him so or he went to school or he
[56:49] has a close family member who just was
[56:51] the the way they were uh brought up but
[56:55] as a whole we will see this is my my
[56:57] opinion and and I want to believe that
[56:59] we will see less socialism less
[57:03] communism because of Bitcoin because the
[57:05] new generation will Embrace this
[57:08] technology and they will take the time
[57:11] to start the technology and realize that
[57:13] socialism does not work you know I do do
[57:16] hope so and I also see uh even in Europe
[57:20] the
[57:21] Socialist uh concept is getting less and
[57:25] less popular
[57:26] uh the the concept of like conservatism
[57:31] and the concept of like having uh the
[57:34] economy A Little Bit Stronger less state
[57:37] gets more and more popular versus the
[57:40] Socialist and the more left leaning and
[57:43] more green leaning uh con gets less and
[57:46] less popular actually now if you see all
[57:49] the elections also in Europe so I hope
[57:51] that American Spirit Comes to Europe
[57:53] honestly uh and I think Europe would be
[57:57] would Europe has a a two a fork in front
[58:00] of them like either they go full on and
[58:03] go more with Central Banking more with
[58:06] socialism more with dling and then
[58:08] Europe will be a museum like an open air
[58:11] museum and and nobody will want to do
[58:13] anything in here uh or we actually kind
[58:17] of try to do what America is doing and
[58:21] try to get open markets free competition
[58:24] Innovation happening L State like all
[58:27] those good things that all common sense
[58:30] people kind of agree on and the people
[58:32] actually waking up to that but the
[58:33] politicians I feel like still need some
[58:35] time to catch on to that uh but there's
[58:38] like actually in two days is uh the the
[58:43] election in Germany uh will be really
[58:45] interesting to how this shapes up
[58:46] because Germany is the the biggest and
[58:49] the most important uh country and kind
[58:51] of gives the uh the frame of where the
[58:55] Europe is going um uh so this will be
[59:00] really really fun El musk is supporting
[59:03] one party in in Germany that is
[59:05] currently number two and and coming
[59:07] closer and closer to being actually
[59:08] number one uh and I don't know a lot
[59:12] about France actually politics
[59:14] unfortunately in Austria Austria is just
[59:16] too small Austria also matters but it's
[59:20] it's it's it's very small compared to
[59:22] the other bigger ones in in Europe so I
[59:24] have a lot of Hope also for Europe
[59:27] to be more American and not more
[59:30] Cuban I hope we have the right direction
[59:34] I'm a very optimistic guy so uh I will
[59:37] tell you that what happened to America
[59:39] and the United States uh the past year
[59:43] with the Trump um and the magga movement
[59:46] is a signal for the rest of the world
[59:49] and and people are paying attention to
[59:52] that and you can see it you know in the
[59:54] comments when you people are posting
[59:56] from different countries so I do believe
[59:59] that's that's going to change eventually
[60:01] even if the old politicians try to hold
[60:05] down to power I think we're going to win
[60:08] you know Bitcoin is going to win
[60:09] capitalism is going to win because at
[60:11] the end of the day we got to realize
[60:14] that it's up to the individual to be
[60:16] better not to the government to tell us
[60:19] who is better or not and that we are
[60:21] equal that's you know we just
[60:24] need to have a same
[60:26] starting point playing field and Bitcoin
[60:30] helps us to start give us that
[60:33] opportunity uh capitalism help us to
[60:36] start that opportunity and it's up to us
[60:38] whether we want to take it or not
[60:39] because I'm a proof um leaving proof uh
[60:43] example that I came to this country not
[60:46] knowing the language not knowing um the
[60:49] Customs the
[60:51] culture um no money at all we came in
[60:55] literally with no money robing nothing
[60:57] we just went to our my grandparents
[60:59] house and we started from zero and we
[61:02] just needed a a a fair playing field for
[61:05] my family to start and that's what
[61:07] Bitcoin and capitalism does and people
[61:10] have to realize that and they starting
[61:12] to wake up and what happened here in the
[61:13] United States is a wakeup call to a lot
[61:15] of different countries and this New
[61:18] Generation Um of man and woman are going
[61:22] to lead that are going to lead that um
[61:24] the next the the next um uh how do you
[61:28] say the next generation of capitalist um
[61:33] countries and communities because it's
[61:35] been proven over and over and over again
[61:38] that socialism doesn't work the worst
[61:40] time I had in this in this country was
[61:43] unfortunately when bid Biden uh was on
[61:46] on on um on on power you know in power
[61:50] as a president and I felt it and my
[61:53] co-workers and my family members felt it
[61:55] we felt inse secure we felt um you know
[62:00] that we were not being represented in
[62:03] the world
[62:04] stage unfortunately we don't want that
[62:07] and people realize that in order to have
[62:10] a strong economy a strong country you
[62:12] need to have an Embrace and a strong
[62:14] leadership so I do believe Europe I'm a
[62:17] very optimistic guy so I do believe
[62:19] Europe will be um will'll get it and
[62:23] little by little we're going to get rid
[62:24] of all these these people and all these
[62:26] politicians that they just looking for
[62:28] themselves at the end of day just follow
[62:30] the money they all have a Personal
[62:33] Agenda and interest uh for themselves
[62:35] they don't care about their people at
[62:37] all they don't care that's just
[62:40] reality uh that's that's that's very
[62:42] very true um I we are we already over
[62:46] time I hope you still have some time um
[62:49] because I want to have one more I mean
[62:51] there many more topics I actually wanted
[62:53] to discuss with you but there's one more
[62:55] topic that is really interesting because
[62:57] you also invest in real estate uh and I
[63:00] see more and more real estate people
[63:02] actually coming over to bitcoin because
[63:04] of all the disadvantages that come with
[63:07] real estate you already mentioned some
[63:08] of them and real estate is also
[63:10] interesting because it's such a big one
[63:14] like it there's so much money in real
[63:16] estate and yes there will always be
[63:18] money in real estate because like people
[63:21] will pay for having a roof on top on top
[63:23] of their head but I think the
[63:26] Financial premium that we have in real
[63:29] estate is just extremely high uh and the
[63:33] utility value is just way lower than the
[63:36] actual Financial premium that is in
[63:38] there um do you see uh real estate as
[63:42] like one of the major markets that that
[63:47] will come into Bitcoin and also um how
[63:52] did you think through why Bitcoin is so
[63:55] super per to real estate especially as
[63:57] you invested in real estate before
[64:00] Bitcoin As I understood it uh how what
[64:03] did you needed to understand to go from
[64:05] Real Estate to
[64:08] bitcoin well to begin with I went to
[64:11] real estate to begin with because I
[64:14] didn't have or I didn't understand
[64:16] Bitcoin if I had a little bit of
[64:17] knowledge about Bitcoin at the time and
[64:20] I had those two opportunities I would
[64:22] definitely would have gone with Bitcoin
[64:24] 100% the the only reason we go um when I
[64:27] say we is me and and people that I know
[64:29] of in the real estate business that we
[64:32] do real estate is because most of us we
[64:35] don't want we don't want a a quick
[64:37] profit we're just trying to save our
[64:39] money for the future and we seeing how
[64:42] real estate performs over time so I was
[64:46] just a regular guy who wanted to save
[64:48] money I don't want to I don't want to do
[64:50] real estate if you think if you talk
[64:52] about regular people that own a couple
[64:54] properties that don't want to deal with
[64:56] real estate they never wanted to be into
[64:58] the real estate business they just
[65:00] wanted to conserve and and and preserve
[65:02] their their their cash value but they
[65:05] knew if they put it in a bank over time
[65:09] it was going to melt so they just saw
[65:11] real estate as that vehicle to kind of
[65:15] save and preserve that cash value but
[65:17] they don't want to be Real Estate
[65:19] Investors I never wanted to be a real
[65:20] estate investor I just wanted to have my
[65:22] money last and grow over time you know
[65:26] that's all I wanted to do so there's a
[65:28] bunch of people like me that they found
[65:31] Bitcoin after the fact that they
[65:33] invested in real estate and they really
[65:35] see all the up all the props of H
[65:38] Bitcoin and compared to the downside of
[65:41] real estate which is a lot I'm telling
[65:43] you is a lot um I already mentioned
[65:46] dealing with the tenants property taxes
[65:49] in one of my properties I just got a
[65:51] notification it went up almost 100% my
[65:54] property taxes cuz they did an
[65:56] assessment and I didn't have something
[65:58] that we have here called homestad
[66:00] extension so that's a different thing
[66:02] but pretty much it's an investment
[66:05] property you cannot have an homest
[66:08] exemption on it so pretty much they do
[66:11] an assessment from time to time and they
[66:12] decided how much that property is value
[66:16] based on market conditions and therefore
[66:18] how much you should be paying on taxes
[66:20] Bitcoin you don't have any of that you
[66:22] don't have to deal with any all you got
[66:23] to do is put aside your money and let
[66:26] Bitcoin do what it does so a bunch of
[66:28] people are going to be selling the real
[66:29] estate including myself and they just
[66:31] gonna go into this better faster less um
[66:36] concerning or or less um time consuming
[66:39] technology because what do you do with
[66:41] real with Bitcoin just pretty much Buy
[66:42] and Hold that's all you have to do as an
[66:45] investor if you look at it that way if
[66:47] you just want your money to grow over
[66:48] time you don't want to deal with
[66:51] anything anybody and you don't want to
[66:54] have any headaches just put your money
[66:55] in Bitcoin Let It Grow whatever money
[66:58] you don't need today you don't need
[66:59] tomorrow just let it grow there the only
[67:01] reason people do in my opinion and the
[67:04] people that are enough they went into
[67:06] the real estate because they didn't have
[67:07] any other vehicle and they saw their
[67:10] their cash melting like me you know I
[67:12] had money I had this great saving habit
[67:15] I was saving money away and the next
[67:17] year that savings whatever $100 will buy
[67:20] me less I'm like wait a minute what's
[67:22] going on here where do I go where do I
[67:24] put my money on real estate that's what
[67:27] the the um the standard was to keep your
[67:33] money save and and grow over time
[67:35] because that's what we see you know
[67:37] that's what they tell you real estate
[67:39] invest in 10 20 years you're going to
[67:42] have it's GNA it's going to be more
[67:43] valuable so you can sell it or whatever
[67:45] it is that you want to do but at the end
[67:47] of the day a lot of people don't want to
[67:48] deal with that they just went into it
[67:50] because they wanted to save and they saw
[67:53] that as a saving vehicle not because
[67:55] they want to be Real Estate Investors I
[67:57] don't want to be a real estate investor
[67:58] I don't want to deal with tenants but I
[68:00] had to save my Capital my money my
[68:03] energy somewhere and at the moment I
[68:05] didn't have Bitcoin I didn't understand
[68:06] it I didn't realize it what it was so
[68:08] that's the only reason I went with uh
[68:10] real estate and all these people there
[68:12] are millions of us that feel like like
[68:14] this this way we're going to sell that
[68:16] we're going to get rid of the trouble
[68:18] we're going to S get rid of the headache
[68:20] and at the end of the day the return is
[68:22] way higher over time way higher
[68:26] so there's nothing to pretty much think
[68:28] about you know that's my opinion when it
[68:32] comes to the topic of real estate it
[68:33] will
[68:34] get the value um a lot of people are TR
[68:37] to convert their their second third
[68:39] fourth uh home and apartment into
[68:42] Bitcoin just a matter of time it's
[68:43] already happening by the way I I I talk
[68:46] to people online all the time they're
[68:49] already selling the properties uh right
[68:52] and left because there's no other
[68:55] there's no other better vehicle out
[68:57] there than than Bitcoin with the less
[68:59] hustle you know how how close are you
[69:02] already on a on a on a Bitcoin standard
[69:04] yourself I would say
[69:06] have I have a you know a year or two
[69:11] left to reach my target um and then
[69:16] after that I'm I'm full on bitcoin no
[69:19] properties just my primary property and
[69:22] and that's it planning to sell
[69:24] everything
[69:26] um uh that I have uh when it comes to
[69:28] real estate converted to bitcoin um
[69:32] within the next year or so I love that
[69:36] that that that's really obviously I love
[69:38] that but it's it's it's a I think it's a
[69:40] great decision uh for you your family
[69:42] and and your future really cool um there
[69:46] there is one question that I always ask
[69:48] my guests and the question is what can
[69:50] we learn from you besides Bitcoin well
[69:53] um something that happened to to me that
[69:56] besides Bitcoin that changed my life and
[69:59] I would tell anybody especially the male
[70:03] population I have a
[70:05] kid have a son a daughter that changed
[70:10] my life I mean I'm a different a total
[70:12] different person after my daughter was
[70:14] born so besides Bitcoin that's
[70:18] my my baby I would say like um if I
[70:23] would if I can advise anybody um when it
[70:26] comes to life uh have a have a kid it
[70:30] will change you will you will see
[70:32] everything in in in a different
[70:34] perspective and for the better you will
[70:36] be more more optimistic uh of the future
[70:39] once you see this little angel walking
[70:42] around and you just want the future to
[70:44] be better for them therefore making you
[70:47] a better person you know because things

[73:01] Saturday that's when the big purchases
[73:04] happen and then the rest of the week and
[73:06] it's a pretty cool initiative because I
[73:08] realized that people love stacking
[73:10] together you know especially bitcoiners
[73:12] they get excited by knowing that
[73:15] different uh people are buying Bitcoin
[73:17] and so far we have removed
[73:20] 27.5 Bitcoins from uh circulation we're
[73:24] talking about Maxes here all these guys
[73:27] or girls we just buy and put it in Cold
[73:30] Storage so from since January
[73:33] 20125 we have removed 27.5 Bitcoins from
[73:37] circulation and the community is growing
[73:39] a lot so I will say for your viewers if
[73:42] they want to check it out be part of it
