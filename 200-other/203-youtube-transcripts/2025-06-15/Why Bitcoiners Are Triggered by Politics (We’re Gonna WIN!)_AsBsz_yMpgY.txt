[00:00] you just had to sniff through so much
[00:02] that you learn how to see what's fake
[00:05] and what's built to just be good on the
[00:06] surface that a lot of the luxury brands
[00:08] of today are pretty Hollow underneath
[00:11] unfortunately Bitcoin is super tied with
[00:12] politics right now which I think a lot
[00:14] of bitcoiners are just a little
[00:15] triggered by and my biggest hope for
[00:18] Politics as a bitcoiner is that I have a
[00:20] hard choice in four years and so it's
[00:22] it's a harder thing to get companies
[00:24] that are profitable but in their early
[00:26] stages to really hold Bitcoin if you
[00:28] expect them to give you a discount for
[00:30] spending Bitcoin I think it's a little
[00:32] bit harder of a proposition bitcoiners
[00:34] and companies are kind of just learning
[00:36] we're just stepping into that role in
[00:38] the world where we have enough money we
[00:40] have enough of like a large cboard of
[00:42] people and we're going to win like we're
[00:44] not going to go away at this
[00:46] [Music]
[00:50] point hi Ben how you doing uh thanks
[00:53] again
[00:53] Fork thanks for being again on the
[00:57] podcast yeah great to see you Robin it's
[00:59] it's cool to it's cool to come back a
[01:02] year later and I mean see you've been
[01:04] crushing it and still going hard and um
[01:07] it's fun to catch up yeah absolutely I'm
[01:10] I'm just getting started I'm always
[01:12] saying but it has been a wild year um
[01:16] from I think it's it's about one year
[01:18] since we last recorded probably a little
[01:20] bit more than that um what has happened
[01:23] in Bitcoin which was really interesting
[01:25] for you like what is kind of your
[01:27] highlight that that has been happening
[01:29] in in the the last year for you I think
[01:31] it's it's kind of just like a little bit
[01:34] more of acceptance of kind of
[01:36] realization that this is here to stay
[01:38] and uh not being attacked I first got
[01:43] into a Bitcoin at the top of the last
[01:45] cycle and in writing it down all the way
[01:49] I continuously you know tried to tell
[01:52] people about it and um going through my
[01:55] craziness of trying to get people into
[01:57] Bitcoin it was always Bitcoin all get
[02:00] shut down by the government cool like
[02:02] don't need to care about it can write it
[02:04] off and during that time as well the
[02:07] Biden Administration was coming at
[02:09] Bitcoin companies and crypto companies
[02:13] pretty aggressively um from the banking
[02:16] angle and so I think the biggest thing
[02:19] for me is that that is just I mean
[02:22] seemingly laid to rest now I can't say
[02:26] completely but you just got to think
[02:28] that in four years coin is in in such a
[02:31] different spot that whatever the next
[02:33] Administration does can't really be
[02:35] aggressively curtailing Bitcoin
[02:38] companies or bitcoiners just because
[02:40] it's so much more integrated into
[02:44] society into businesses and into their
[02:48] wellbeing and their competitors
[02:50] well-being that um not that I ever
[02:54] thought Bitcoin was going to get shut
[02:55] down by the government but it's more
[02:56] just like for the first 3 four years of
[03:00] being into it I fully expected to be
[03:03] labeled a criminal or have what I
[03:07] do blackballed by the government at some
[03:11] point and it's pretty crazy for me to
[03:16] feel like that's no longer really on the
[03:19] table at least in a meaningful
[03:21] percentage
[03:22] chance that's super it's it it kind of
[03:25] got more and more obvious I I just
[03:27] talked about that that early Bitcoin are
[03:30] kind of Lucky to even had the chance of
[03:34] seeing Bitcoin but that luck gets less
[03:36] and less and less because now it's like
[03:39] if if you see Bitcoin and you see that
[03:43] uh presidents are talking about it big
[03:45] company leaders are talking about it um
[03:48] you have to be that curious that you
[03:51] actually look at it so now it gets less
[03:53] and less luck it's it's more of like now
[03:55] it's your fault if you don't get it and
[03:58] if you don't research it uh where to the
[04:01] point where Bitcoin is really kind of an
[04:04] almost an obvious trade that that that
[04:06] you are doing now even if you don't get
[04:09] the re
[04:10] revolutionary um um some money aspect of
[04:14] it at least you should know this this
[04:17] might be a thing so it might be a good
[04:19] idea to have something of that in your
[04:22] portfolio and if we just get that we
[04:25] have we we we already won because then
[04:28] the the rabbit hole goes if if you have
[04:30] a little bit of Bitcoin you that it just
[04:33] keeps inreasing for people yeah I think
[04:36] the lift to just going from zero to a
[04:38] tiny bit is much lower the lift to
[04:42] understanding Bitcoin is still huge uh I
[04:47] mean anytime I'm trying to explain it
[04:49] it's like well if you don't have all
[04:50] these foundations for all these economic
[04:53] principles like it's maybe hard for me
[04:55] to explain maybe I'm also just not the
[04:57] right person and everyone kind of needs
[04:59] their correct angle to get at it from
[05:02] but uh there's a reason we all went down
[05:06] the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole some of it's
[05:07] curiosity some it's necessity and um I
[05:12] think that that lift is still hard while
[05:14] there's more resources but yeah the lift
[05:16] to get from zero to one and then to have
[05:20] that incentive to have you keep going is
[05:23] much easier and also one of the reasons
[05:25] to just look it off is relatively gone
[05:29] so uh my fear is
[05:32] that it's going to be looked at within
[05:36] the divisive clim climate of the United
[05:38] States politics where um I grew up
[05:43] pretty left leaning and um not trying to
[05:47] get deep into politics here but grew up
[05:49] pretty left leaning and um through
[05:51] college pretty left leaning and
[05:52] therefore most of my friends are pretty
[05:53] left leaning and I'm just just saying
[05:57] I'm exposed to that side and I'm um
[06:00] relatively uh mindful at least that
[06:04] Bitcoin will be lumped into a trump
[06:06] thing and therefore attacked by half of
[06:09] the populace um or seen as an enemy just
[06:13] been being linked to him and so while I
[06:16] see it any president adopting it as a
[06:20] positive thing um just the downside of
[06:24] um it being lumped into political
[06:25] culture in the United States is
[06:27] definitely still there and I hope that
[06:30] my friends on the
[06:32] left don't let that stop them from a
[06:35] pretty neutral political
[06:38] technology yeah it's the the threat of
[06:41] it being a political thing but there's
[06:43] um there's a good amount of Voters in
[06:46] America that are bitcoiners and that are
[06:49] voting Democrat uh even in the last
[06:51] election even though Trump was a big on
[06:54] a Bitcoin conference a big Bitcoin
[06:56] proponent um because I did a some videos
[07:00] with um Trump supporters with like
[07:03] people saying I that that that that's
[07:05] kind of the obvious Bitcoin choice and I
[07:07] got so many comments saying like oh like
[07:09] how can you vote for him I'm a bitcoiner
[07:11] I vote for Harris like um I think we we
[07:15] focus on on the big messages and and we
[07:18] focus like okay Bitcoin Trump but I
[07:20] think there are a lot of a lot is a lot
[07:23] is such a wake term but there's uh
[07:27] definitely a good group of people that
[07:29] voted for Harris uh even though they are
[07:31] Bitcoin as lot like that's a thing
[07:34] there's even like uh bit Bitcoin for
[07:36] Harris groups uh that tried to um raise
[07:41] funds I even had uh I forgot his name
[07:43] sorry but I had someone from from them
[07:47] on my show uh so there's a big uh group
[07:51] also having being on the on the left
[07:54] side I even have friends that are
[07:56] completely left really in the Green
[07:57] Field all in bit coin um because they
[08:01] also get the Bitcoin thing they just
[08:03] have a different political mindset of of
[08:05] where they want to go but I think mostly
[08:09] mostly Bitcoin has voted Trump I think
[08:12] um last time but they just wanted to say
[08:15] like I think maybe it's just the public
[08:17] perception on Twitter that it's a little
[08:20] bit uh more extreme than it actually is
[08:24] for sure and Twitter's somewhat self-
[08:26] selecting um since Elon took over and I
[08:30] mean my biggest like unfortunately
[08:33] Bitcoin is super tied with politics
[08:34] right now um which I think a lot of
[08:36] bitcoiners are just a little triggered
[08:38] by and my biggest hope for Politics as a
[08:42] bitcoiner is that I have a hard choice
[08:43] in four
[08:45] years and that's kind of the best best I
[08:48] can hope for um that said I think that
[08:51] there's a ton of room for just the
[08:55] Grassroots Bitcoin isation of the world
[08:59] um growing and we see I think politics
[09:03] while definitely like we hope is a a
[09:06] will of the people um it's a a bit of a
[09:09] top- down approach to bitcoin adoption
[09:12] and it's nice to have that top cover
[09:14] that you're not going to get arrested
[09:15] for holding Bitcoin or starting a a
[09:17] company in Bitcoin but I think there's a
[09:19] lot to be seen in the uh the growth from
[09:24] the bottom up of Bitcoin adoption
[09:27] throughout the world and um one of the
[09:29] parallels I see as um super important
[09:33] right now is from politics to economics
[09:37] is the Bitcoin crypto Lobby or cohart of
[09:43] people is talked about a lot as swinging
[09:45] this election especially monetarily with
[09:48] uh donations but I think people were a
[09:50] huge part of that and I am starting to
[09:54] really focus on um trying to build out
[10:00] the um well that's maybe a strong way of
[10:02] saying it but I think that the Bitcoin
[10:04] cohort of consumers is also going to be
[10:07] something that uh grows with time and
[10:10] becomes extremely important hopefully in
[10:13] the next few years or now um depending
[10:17] on the business depending on what you
[10:18] offer and um depending on your size
[10:22] bitcoiners can have a meaningful role in
[10:25] both uh bringing that big that company
[10:28] maybe towards bit coin a little bit more
[10:30] and influencing which companies really
[10:32] Thrive and survive um as the cohort of
[10:35] people grows and as our purchasing power
[10:37] continues to grow I think Bitcoin
[10:39] companies especially smaller ones right
[10:41] now um and I'm not talking about
[10:44] companies in S&P 500 adopting Bitcoin as
[10:47] a treasury Reserve asset I'm saying
[10:48] Bitcoin companies companies that accept
[10:51] Bitcoin companies that are comfortable
[10:53] um with Bitcoin and companies that make
[10:55] products that bitcoiners want so high
[10:58] quality lasting
[10:59] and built with some form of Integrity um
[11:03] I think those companies are are the
[11:04] really interesting ones to watch right
[11:06] now because bitcoiners can actually have
[11:08] a a meaningful say in what's being
[11:11] produced which companies succeed um by
[11:14] just the little thing of a company maybe
[11:17] accepting Bitcoin or just being curious
[11:19] about it and learning um and maybe this
[11:22] is a little bit less like the corner
[11:23] store down the street not talking like
[11:25] high quality products being made that
[11:27] bitcoiners are specifically interested
[11:29] in
[11:30] uh is just an interesting spot for the
[11:31] world right
[11:32] now it's super interesting you think
[11:35] about that um or the power of Bitcoin is
[11:38] first of all like the in the last
[11:40] lecture what we' seen that Bitcoin is
[11:42] already such a relevant voting plock
[11:45] that President feels like okay he has to
[11:47] go to a Bitcoin conference but then also
[11:50] within companies they're getting more
[11:52] and more influential uh and uh getting
[11:55] also more and more influential in life
[11:57] in general in the world positions how
[12:00] how do you think the world changes when
[12:03] bitcoiners are getting more more in
[12:06] control of huge amount of resources if
[12:08] they want to bitcoin and Bitcoin is
[12:10] going where it it goes bitcoiners will
[12:13] be the elite will be the the the the big
[12:17] the the kind of the um yeah those people
[12:21] that control huge amount of
[12:23] resources so bitcoiners will be everyone
[12:27] but I think that Bitcoin um and stills
[12:29] bit
[12:29] of different incentives to the way you
[12:32] spend money and the way you approach
[12:33] things um and also there is the cohort
[12:36] of relatively early adopters that are in
[12:38] it for the um Revolution as opposed to
[12:41] just saving money um so it's a bit of a
[12:43] broad term to be saying but I think in
[12:46] general bitcoiners are looking for a
[12:49] product that is built um to last and
[12:52] with integrity and the difference
[12:55] between that and what people who have
[12:58] money now make are spending um in
[13:01] general
[13:02] is I think people now are spending thing
[13:05] money on things that are bit to be meant
[13:08] to be a bit more flashy meant to show
[13:10] like hey this is wealth um I'm rich I
[13:13] bought this thing that's flashy maybe I
[13:15] just replace it all the time and get new
[13:17] stuff um sure you're buying quality but
[13:20] I think that the uh the show is more
[13:23] important than how long it actually
[13:25] lasts because you don't want to be seen
[13:26] with old stuff if you're super wealthy
[13:29] now I believe um bitcoiners on the other
[13:33] other hand
[13:35] are kind of can sniff out that [ __ ]
[13:38] pretty easily I find I mean especially
[13:41] if you're like hardcore bitcoiner at
[13:43] this stage in the game you've had to
[13:45] wave through so much crap to be able to
[13:47] get to this place whether it be U
[13:51] altcoins um or just Fiat fuery to say
[13:55] excuse my French but I don't know
[13:57] there's another way to say it uh
[14:00] you just had to sniff through so much
[14:02] that you learn how to see what's fake
[14:05] and what's built to just be good on the
[14:07] surface that a lot of the luxury brands
[14:09] of today are um pretty Hollow underneath
[14:13] so as an American you look for generally
[14:16] things that are made U by America
[14:18] because that's something that has been
[14:20] hollowed out in our world we really want
[14:22] like Americans I think want to support
[14:24] American made because it's just
[14:26] something that we lost as the global
[14:29] Reserve currency we lost the ability to
[14:30] produce things and that's something that
[14:33] we find pride in supporting um and
[14:35] building back because that's the like
[14:37] the the history of America that's the
[14:40] time period of of America that we see as
[14:42] like the most strong the most patriotic
[14:43] is the time when Americans made things
[14:45] so figuring out um companies that do
[14:48] that companies that just make super high
[14:49] quality products companies that make
[14:51] things that are legitimately good for
[14:53] you um in the long run and those that
[14:56] are just honest don't lie and uh um if
[15:00] they're on the same mission for you as
[15:02] well I think that's super valuable thing
[15:04] so um I think the the thing people Point
[15:07] towards is uh Black Rifle Coffee Co
[15:09] which is like a super right-wing coffee
[15:12] company but coffee is kind of a
[15:15] commodity in grand scheme of things I
[15:18] mean sure you can like different roasts
[15:20] But ultimately like the copy's a pretty
[15:23] commoditized product so um that's just
[15:26] saying like people buy this coffee
[15:28] because it's sport the mission that
[15:29] they're on um bitcoiners can have the
[15:31] same thing where if you just show that
[15:34] you're on the mission and you're not
[15:36] doing this in a whole away You're
[15:37] legitimately here I think Bitcoin is
[15:39] support but in addition to that it's
[15:42] also high quality Goods built to last um
[15:46] that are made with
[15:48] Integrity yeah I think this the circular
[15:51] economy of like bitcoiners want to
[15:54] support other
[15:55] bitcoiners and want to also spend the
[15:58] Bitcoin and kind of bring this whole
[16:02] circular economy this I don't know
[16:04] digital citadels uh building um is a
[16:08] huge part of of what I find bitcoiners
[16:11] are really fascinated with and and I
[16:14] like that I I I do get Bitcoin income I
[16:18] do pay one of my post production members
[16:21] in Bitcoin so that's like a circular
[16:24] economy going on there we free parties I
[16:26] get the money in Bitcoin I give it away
[16:28] way in Bitcoin again uh and this is
[16:31] already a small circular economy and if
[16:34] we build more and more of of of those
[16:36] Bitcoin things where there is high
[16:39] quality and it's based and denominated
[16:43] also in Bitcoin uh that's like living
[16:46] the future right now that that that
[16:49] actually feels amazing how how has it
[16:52] been for for you in in in your company
[16:55] with wine and and and the connection
[16:57] with Bitcoin
[16:59] so I I think I've felt this much more
[17:02] than any most companies are set up to
[17:06] feel um just because I am small it's
[17:09] really just me with a few other uh
[17:11] people that I hire for specific tasks
[17:14] and also because I am fullon a Bitcoin
[17:17] or like Allin this is all that matters
[17:20] um and it sucked me in uh from a
[17:23] legitimate passion perspective so uh the
[17:25] businesses that I'm talking about I
[17:27] don't think they need to get to this
[17:28] point I don't think they need to become
[17:30] full-on bitcoiners to experience the the
[17:32] benefits of bitcoiners being a customer
[17:35] base um I think they will and I think
[17:38] that's just where incentives go once you
[17:39] kind of get that first little bit of
[17:41] Bitcoin like we were talking about
[17:42] earlier um the the barriers a lot
[17:45] smaller to get there um but I think that
[17:48] their orange pilling journey is a little
[17:50] bit less like yeah sure number go up but
[17:53] also I need money to reinvest into my
[17:55] business constantly and It's tricky to
[17:59] get them from that zero to one like I
[18:01] need to hold Bitcoin bitcoin's kind of
[18:03] taking profits so I'm not continuously
[18:05] on this treadmill of buy more product
[18:08] sell it my num my uh cost goes up raise
[18:11] the price buy more product sell it it's
[18:14] a treadmill that just never stops and so
[18:16] you slowly start getting off when you
[18:17] start getting Bitcoin and you need that
[18:19] high quality product to be able to
[18:21] attract Bitcoin um I am at a spot where
[18:24] like I started out wine making and uh
[18:29] knew that I wanted to start a business
[18:30] kind of just went for it and taught
[18:33] myself how to make wine taught myself
[18:34] how to run a business and the path to
[18:39] like the business path that I wanted to
[18:41] run was initially like start farmers
[18:43] markets and then probably open up a
[18:44] Tasting Room like the five to 10 other
[18:47] wineries in my hometown and just grow
[18:50] like they do but what joining the
[18:54] Bitcoin Community has given me is like
[18:57] now I think need to just limit myself to
[19:00] this tiny quarter of Colorado I have
[19:02] this entire community of people all
[19:04] around the United States that are
[19:06] supportive of a Bitcoin company that
[19:09] makes high quality wine with good
[19:11] ingredients just grapes so like I check
[19:14] all the boxes for who would want to
[19:17] spend like for a Bitcoin are wanting to
[19:20] spend money at a specific company I'm a
[19:23] bitcoiner obviously accept Bitcoin make
[19:25] a high quality product um and and that's
[19:30] like that's the
[19:31] Baseline that's that's a great spot to
[19:33] be but um because I'm so all in I've
[19:36] been able to make that really the
[19:38] entirety of my business and not have to
[19:40] limit myself and just really be
[19:42] completely expansive so um I think that
[19:45] will change as more competition in the
[19:46] wi industry comes in um I will probably
[19:49] have to be a bit more localized but um
[19:53] there's there's room for all these other
[19:54] businesses to tap into that because
[19:56] there are so many industries that you're
[19:58] the first
[19:59] um and you can get massive market share
[20:01] as a small business uh when it comes to
[20:04] bitcoiners and it's really just like if
[20:06] you're not quite there it's really hard
[20:08] to see how crazy passionate um and
[20:12] driven bitcoiners are both to spread
[20:14] Bitcoin and to support people that are
[20:16] on their same Mission um and they drive
[20:18] for just high quality products and so
[20:20] it's kind of like I'm trying to just
[20:23] tell people like what happened to
[20:26] me and say like you can just test this
[20:29] out see if it works and hopefully
[20:31] bitcoiners are aware that of the power
[20:33] they have as a consumer um I think
[20:35] there's it's a little hard because
[20:38] you're always like until you're maybe
[20:40] you know 10 years into Bitcoin like
[20:42] you're always like man I can really
[20:44] stack more I don't want to spend a ton
[20:46] of money I've not always you know you
[20:48] feel the dips a little bit more um but I
[20:52] think at a certain point you you kind of
[20:53] just reach a spot where you're like look
[20:55] I I support this Mission I want to live
[20:57] on bitcoin only and the only way to do
[20:59] that is to support companies that
[21:01] further myself towards that mission that
[21:03] allow me to buy all the things I need in
[21:04] life with Bitcoin um and a s yeah you're
[21:09] just not like really getting closer to
[21:11] the mission if you're not spending your
[21:13] money voting with your money and so I
[21:15] think bitcoiners are waking up to that I
[21:17] think that there's a big enough cohort
[21:19] of us that we can kind of be a bit of a
[21:21] Snowball Effect um I know everyone makes
[21:23] different economic choices but I think
[21:25] there are these things that guide
[21:27] General space money for bitcoiners and
[21:31] um we're just beginning to realize our
[21:35] power it's an interesting thought um
[21:38] because the market goes where the
[21:39] purchasing power goes and uh purchasing
[21:42] power goes more and more into Bitcoin as
[21:44] hand so that's a really
[21:46] interesting it's also right now you can
[21:49] actually Market yourself as a Bitcoin
[21:52] company but at some point it will look
[21:54] probably
[21:55] ridiculous like yeah yeah like everyone
[21:57] has Bitcoin like Bitcoin will be boring
[22:00] thing this will be fun uh to to to see
[22:04] how how long this effect loss of of of
[22:09] of branding something with Bitcoin and
[22:11] it it has a pull uh a pull effect uh
[22:16] because at some point like yeah of
[22:19] course you're a Bitcoin company like
[22:20] every company like you you save your
[22:22] money in Bitcoin like you accept Bitcoin
[22:24] like that at some point this will be a
[22:26] normal thing uh will be fun to see those
[22:29] transition times but I think like for
[22:31] the next 5 to 10 years uh companies will
[22:34] have a major advantage uh if they
[22:37] position themselves as a Bitcoin company
[22:39] not only marketing wise but just from a
[22:41] balance sheet perspective like the the
[22:44] the advantage is very obvious you uh if
[22:47] if a if a big company or like even a
[22:50] small midsize company is just going
[22:52] there like hey let's convert I don't
[22:54] know 20% of our cash reserves uh in into
[22:57] Bitcoin what speaks against that it
[23:00] seems it seems so obvious especially if
[23:01] you really uh say like okay I want to
[23:04] preserve my company for a longterm I
[23:07] think saor said it actually on my
[23:09] podcast even uh of like if you want to
[23:12] make your company Immortal and make it
[23:15] uh live forever um switch to bitcoin
[23:18] standard uh because there's a good
[23:20] chance that the increase of purchasing
[23:22] power might outlift all your expenses in
[23:25] the future even if your business is
[23:27] going through a rough path
[23:29] and I think Bitcoin can do so much for
[23:32] companies it's it's so overlooked and
[23:34] I'm just I'm just boggled by how few
[23:37] companies actually do
[23:39] that right and I think what you're
[23:41] getting at is is totally no-brainer if
[23:43] you have a big stack of cash reserves uh
[23:46] you probably should have some Bitcoin
[23:49] but what I'm getting at is is there's a
[23:51] lot of companies and I probably say the
[23:54] majority of companies around the world
[23:56] don't have big cash Reserves they're
[23:59] either growing or and just trying to
[24:01] reinvest everything back into their
[24:03] business or they're dying and um need to
[24:08] get a leg up and so these companies I
[24:11] think would be well off in positioning
[24:14] themselves from a marketing perspective
[24:16] towards bitcoiners because you can I
[24:20] mean think I don't know the history of
[24:21] like Gucci or anything but it was
[24:24] probably a super high quality producer
[24:26] that started from nothing and grew
[24:27] themselves up by pitching themselves to
[24:29] the Future Financial Elite or the
[24:31] financial Elite of the time and I think
[24:33] it's this there's this spot for any
[24:36] company that makes a super high quality
[24:38] product to them position themselves
[24:40] towards bitcoiners and all of a sudden
[24:42] become the product of the future
[24:46] Financial Elite the thing that
[24:47] bitcoiners get after and if bitcoiners
[24:50] are going to have all the money that is
[24:53] the ideal person to go after for future
[24:58] so if companies now see that bitcoiners
[25:02] are the future people to go after they
[25:05] start making products that bitcoiners
[25:07] want and we're a bit you know amorphous
[25:10] we're all different people from all
[25:11] walks of life uh people who believe very
[25:14] different things as we were saying
[25:15] earlier but I think there's these core
[25:17] standards of quality and integrity that
[25:20] if you have those and you say we're on
[25:23] that same Mission I think that goes a
[25:25] long ways and um bitcoiners are kind of
[25:28] just like I said bitcoiners and
[25:30] companies are kind of just learning
[25:32] we're just stepping into that role in
[25:34] the world where we have enough money we
[25:36] have enough of like a large cboard of
[25:38] people and we're gonna win like we're
[25:41] not going to go away at this point so
[25:44] it's it's this barrier to entry to
[25:45] making products for bitcoiners yes
[25:47] saving your money in Bitcoin that's a
[25:49] no-brainer um but I think there this
[25:51] slightly different angle that we hear
[25:53] these big investors and like it's
[25:56] interesting man I'm super into like yeah
[25:59] why isn't Apple buying Bitcoin with
[26:00] their massive cash reserves instead of
[26:02] just they're buying their stock back um
[26:05] that's super interesting but I think the
[26:07] meaningful change comes from the ground
[26:09] up and businesses realizing that
[26:12] bitcoiners as people are the people are
[26:15] the are the customer base that they
[26:16] should be targeting and it's smaller so
[26:18] smaller companies are going to feel feel
[26:20] it a little bit more but that grows up
[26:22] and eventually you're making products
[26:25] for the the financial
[26:28] a lead of the world people who have
[26:30] power and uh that's kind of a that's
[26:33] just a an opportunity that's pretty
[26:35] crazy to pass up why do you
[26:38] think why don't you why do you think
[26:41] more companies aren't looking into this
[26:44] like on doing Bitcoin of things rather
[26:47] like it it can be putting on a balance
[26:50] sheet it can be for for their customers
[26:53] can be marketing can be accepting like
[26:56] you can do so many bit bitco things as
[26:58] you just laid out why do you think more
[27:01] companies aren't looking into this well
[27:04] it's kind of twofold is is one I think
[27:07] bitcoiners are just coming into their
[27:09] own so there's only really small
[27:11] businesses like mine and maybe a few
[27:13] other um hardcore bitcoiners businesses
[27:16] that have benefited from this um so
[27:19] there's you kind of need this one bigger
[27:23] more not huge but like more known
[27:25] company to really show the way um for a
[27:28] lot of people
[27:30] and also it's it requires understanding
[27:34] of Bitcoin to understand Bitcoin errors
[27:37] and where things are headed so you need
[27:40] to be a little bit B at least if you're
[27:42] not having your handheld um in the
[27:45] Bitcoin World which most people aren't
[27:47] um it's a little crazy to dive in this
[27:49] and a little crazy I mean maybe you just
[27:51] say YOLO and buy a little bit but you're
[27:53] not going to start marketing as it um
[27:55] it's rare that a company would just
[27:58] start accepting Bitcoin because
[28:00] bitcoiners start asking for it and if
[28:03] they do they're probably going to say
[28:05] we're going to buy we're going to accept
[28:06] crypto because we're free market we want
[28:08] to accept everything but what I found is
[28:11] that you actually hurt yourself when you
[28:14] accept uh crypto when it comes to Brand
[28:18] loyalty and um trying to Market to
[28:21] bitcoiners because it's not that like I
[28:24] think we as bitcoiners we understand
[28:26] like yeah sure you want to accept
[28:29] everything from a business you want to
[28:31] accept as a business you want to accept
[28:32] any form payment you want to give me
[28:33] money for my product done but what we're
[28:37] looking for is the as bitcoiners
[28:39] speaking from a bitcoiners perspective
[28:41] we're looking for the value um why are
[28:44] you accepting Bitcoin why should I give
[28:46] you my Bitcoin or why should I give you
[28:48] my dollars just because you accept
[28:49] Bitcoin and other
[28:51] cryptocurrencies and what I think what
[28:53] businesses find is there's very few
[28:56] people maybe Monero excluded um who want
[29:00] to spend
[29:03] shitcoins because they buy those things
[29:06] to make a ton of money the Smart Ones
[29:09] buy those things to try and make a ton
[29:10] of money to buy Bitcoin and um no one's
[29:14] really looking to scale those as payment
[29:16] methods whereas bitcoiners they want to
[29:18] save it and if you want to save it and
[29:22] spend it in the future you probably like
[29:24] it's a bit of a fail safe to invest in
[29:26] spending it right now to invest in the
[29:28] the economy to uh get people to accept
[29:31] it right now uh it's bit of an insurance
[29:34] policy on future Bitcoin value so
[29:38] um I think businesses they kind of like
[29:41] yeah I want to accept everything but if
[29:43] they have someone if they can have
[29:45] someone explain this that maybe they go
[29:46] down the rabbit hole themselves it's a
[29:48] slow barrier it's a large barrier to
[29:50] entry to this um until someone does it
[29:53] and it becomes
[29:56] obvious that it's
[29:58] you got to just accept Bitcoin because
[30:00] bitcoiners are the bitcoiners not crypto
[30:03] people are the ones who are really going
[30:04] to be passionate and willing to um spend
[30:08] their hard earned Bitcoin on something
[30:10] high quality um I just don't see that
[30:14] same passion for building a circular
[30:15] economy in any other community let's
[30:19] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[30:21] the ped that coin vigilante has made
[30:24] with the Bitcoin watches those watches
[30:27] are the most most amazing the most
[30:29] elegent way of showing that you are a
[30:32] true bitcoiner and coin vigilante just
[30:35] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:38] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:40] collections you have the date of the
[30:43] first ever minded Bitcoin Block in there
[30:46] and of course also the block height and
[30:49] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[30:52] the level of detail they put in in this
[30:55] masterpiece make sure to check out those
[30:57] amazing amazing coin vigilante time
[31:00] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[31:02] those watches so so much and now if you
[31:05] have Bitcoin I really do hope that you
[31:08] don't have it on Exchange but if you do
[31:10] have it on Exchange I have two ways for
[31:12] you to deal with that the first way is
[31:14] you put it on a hardware wallet that's
[31:17] the entry for you to get into the self-
[31:20] custody game I recommend bitbox Bitcoin
[31:23] only Edition for that it's a super
[31:26] simple and secure way way and if you
[31:28] check out the link in the description
[31:30] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[31:33] Robin and the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:36] way the Bitcoin way is your Allin
[31:39] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:42] out of your sovereignty they will
[31:45] personalize for you a self custody setup
[31:48] that is perfect for your individual
[31:51] situation they will show you how you can
[31:53] secure your own devices securing your
[31:56] Bitcoin is not enough also have to keep
[31:58] all your devices secure one topic that
[32:01] is overlooked often is the inheritance
[32:04] plan what happens with your Bitcoin once
[32:07] you are no longer here do you have a
[32:09] plan for that in place already and last
[32:12] but not least if you're in a
[32:13] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe
[32:16] it's better to get a plan B for all that
[32:19] head over to the Bitcoin way.com SL
[32:23] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[32:26] just a quick side note I will be for the
[32:29] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[32:31] prag event in June it will be absolutely
[32:35] legendary and I'm really looking forward
[32:37] to seeing all of you there you can get
[32:39] your ticket in the link down in the
[32:42] description of Bitcoin brag and very
[32:44] important use code Robin to get 10% off
[32:48] your ticket I'm really looking forward
[32:50] seeing you there yeah very true actually
[32:52] the the watch brand that I partnered up
[32:54] with uh they did Bitcoin only then they
[32:58] ventured into crypto also and they
[33:01] quickly reversed they went back to
[33:03] bitcoin only uh and uh it's it's super
[33:07] interesting to to see that because
[33:09] you're like Bitcoin is the valuable
[33:14] thing uh from a monetary standpoint and
[33:18] then as a logical progression of that
[33:20] Bitcoin airs are valuable customers that
[33:23] you want uh and I as a
[33:26] bitcoiner i I usually only want to spend
[33:29] my Bitcoin on people that I know will
[33:33] keep the Bitcoin so uh if if there if
[33:38] he's just feared and he's just accepting
[33:40] Bitcoin like I I wouldn't spend my
[33:43] Bitcoin on a Tesla like that was
[33:45] possible previously I think like four
[33:48] years ago something like that um uh not
[33:51] because I don't like bit Tesla but just
[33:54] because I don't like the idea of just
[33:57] using Bitcoin as as that um uh M maybe
[34:03] if I'm only having Bitcoin and I don't
[34:05] want to spend my Fe then I see it
[34:07] differently but there is a better
[34:09] feeling if I know he's a Bitcoin for
[34:11] example there's a local Meetup where I
[34:14] go each month or like it's each month
[34:16] I'm not going each month there but you
[34:18] can uh uh pay with Bitcoin and he's a
[34:22] real Bitcoin like he like he's hardcore
[34:25] and they like what he's doing and there
[34:28] I just always spend Sates like I always
[34:30] spend my Bitcoin there and it's a good
[34:31] feeling like oh like it's Circle economy
[34:33] I know he will not sell it like he he's
[34:36] a bitcoiner uh and and that's that's
[34:39] another aspect maybe to to that where if
[34:41] you're a real bitcoiner and you can
[34:43] communicate that uh bitcoiners are more
[34:46] likely to to give you Bitcoin because
[34:48] they know it's a circular economy and
[34:50] you're not just like making another Ed
[34:53] revenues uh another Revenue stream and
[34:55] then like just dump it on the market
[34:58] after after you got the product which uh
[35:01] I think Bitcoin is lacking that I think
[35:03] that's an aspect of that yeah and I
[35:05] think there are tools um strike
[35:07] specifically that's allowing you to
[35:09] spend dollars and sell and receive it as
[35:10] Bitcoin or whatever currency they they
[35:13] value uh and that will absolutely
[35:15] continue but um the two things you said
[35:17] there are just like um great feedback
[35:20] because I'm happy to hear that my
[35:22] intuition and personal experience is not
[35:24] just limited to me um I think I know
[35:27] though the watch brand you're talking
[35:28] about and um I remember giving them [ __ ]
[35:31] for um that interim period and it's
[35:35] great to hear that they've gone back to
[35:36] bitcoin only and that the market is
[35:38] demanding that because
[35:40] um I mean that's what I've felt and I'm
[35:43] glad I'm just not the only one because I
[35:44] think that is a a
[35:46] greater um I think that really is a
[35:49] greater Trend U the other thing is yeah
[35:52] you're much more likely to spend your
[35:53] Bitcoin with someone who appreciates it
[35:56] because you're like hey I'm giving you
[35:58] this thing that was very like it took a
[36:02] lot for me to get this and I know what
[36:04] and especially considering I know where
[36:05] it's going I'm telling you that I
[36:08] massively appreciate you by spending
[36:10] this Bitcoin on you because I could just
[36:12] give you crap money I could give you
[36:13] dollars give you Euros but I'm giving
[36:16] you Bitcoin and I want you to appreciate
[36:18] this and if you don't what's the point
[36:20] of me giving you Bitcoin it's like
[36:22] giving someone a gift that they don't
[36:23] really care about doesn't feel great so
[36:27] uh
[36:28] I think that's exactly nail on the head
[36:30] is is you want companies that appreciate
[36:32] it that uh either hold it or it's like
[36:37] hey we're trying to hold maybe 10% but
[36:39] we're investing everything else back
[36:41] into uh our business to continue making
[36:44] better products but as a bitcoiner when
[36:46] you spend your Bitcoin or even to a
[36:48] lesser degree but when you just spend
[36:50] your money on a company that you value
[36:52] you're voting for that company to exist
[36:53] and continue making their product in the
[36:55] future and I think that's a power that
[36:58] bitcoiners are just really beginning to
[37:01] feel I mean think of how many bitcoiners
[37:03] there were a decade ago now every single
[37:06] one of those yeah has maybe what 100x
[37:09] purchasing power um and that number just
[37:13] continues growing every single day the
[37:14] number of bitcoiners that exist and the
[37:16] number of bitcoiners who have had their
[37:18] P purchasing power increased to a
[37:20] massive degree so I I just I keep
[37:23] harping on this but I really think
[37:24] bitcoiners as a growing consumer base is
[37:26] something to watch over the next little
[37:28] bit and once we see one company really
[37:34] make a name for themselves by doing this
[37:36] I think there's going to be a ton to
[37:37] follow do you give discounts for for
[37:41] Bitcoin or like premiums for Fiat
[37:44] payments
[37:46] so I'm I'm kind of in the middle of of
[37:49] thinking about this in talking
[37:52] to W in the wine world you're selling a
[37:55] premium product and I with premium
[37:58] products you uh don't really want to be
[38:00] in the discount world because it
[38:01] devalues your product why would I buy it
[38:03] now when I can buy it cheaper in the
[38:05] future where wine is getting more
[38:08] valuable over time so U discounts aren't
[38:11] really something that I'm necessarily
[38:12] looking to do however I have done them
[38:14] in the past and the way I see treating
[38:17] bitcoiners is um more just giving making
[38:22] sure that they have rights to or they
[38:25] have access to maybe exclusive things
[38:27] with Bitcoin um I have some some
[38:30] packages that um and some wies available
[38:33] that are just for bitcoiners and also
[38:35] just making sure they have like I mean I
[38:38] not that other people don't get great
[38:40] customer service from me but really
[38:42] trying to go the extra mile for
[38:43] bitcoiners because I know what they gave
[38:45] me and I'm not taking that lightly and
[38:49] uh more than anyone especially want them
[38:51] to be repeat customers so
[38:55] it's I think that you may see that for
[38:58] future businesses um because it I think
[39:02] when you're just getting into Bitcoin
[39:03] like um this company West major is a
[39:07] Western Wear Company in Phoenix that I
[39:09] just went and visited to get onto a
[39:11] Bitcoin standard and um my my friend who
[39:16] was is on this Venture with me to get
[39:19] these businesses on board at the Bitcoin
[39:22] bought a bunch of shirts from West major
[39:25] um in Bitcoin when Bitcoin was right 100
[39:29] to
[39:30] 105k and you know he's hardcore
[39:33] bitcoiner telling this guy that um is
[39:36] curious about Bitcoin new to it that he
[39:38] should just hold this for a long time
[39:40] don't sell it meanwhile the owner is
[39:45] like I need money to buy more the next
[39:47] round of shirts to sell shirts um so I
[39:49] can make more money to buy the next
[39:51] round of shirts and is on that hamster
[39:53] wheel and U going down to talk to him
[39:56] Bitcoin had dropped down to 85 so um
[39:59] let's just say 15% drop and he's sitting
[40:03] there like watching his Bitcoin
[40:06] devalue and it's hard for him because he
[40:08] wants he's like I was told to sell this
[40:11] or I was told to keep this but I kind of
[40:14] want to buy shirts and shirts I know I
[40:16] can sell and make money whereas this I'm
[40:19] losing money in the short term and I
[40:21] have to make decisions right now and so
[40:24] it's it's a harder thing to get
[40:26] companies that are profitable but in
[40:28] their early stages to really hold
[40:30] Bitcoin and therefore it's like if you
[40:35] expect them to give you a discount for
[40:37] spending Bitcoin I think it's a little
[40:39] bit harder of a proposition because uh
[40:42] these
[40:43] businesses that are not fully on board
[40:45] with Bitcoin and are just kind of
[40:46] Dipping their toes and want to you know
[40:49] are curious maybe they see the fut
[40:51] purchasing power increase in the future
[40:52] they dive deeper they learn about it
[40:54] they see the bitcoiners enthusiasm and
[40:56] they're fully into it but expecting a
[40:58] discount for Bitcoin I think is uh just
[41:01] beyond our skis as bitcoiners once we
[41:04] show how powerful we are once we show
[41:06] like continue to show Bitcoin um as a
[41:09] powerful leverage into the
[41:11] future I think you get that power like
[41:14] there's more companies that really want
[41:16] to have your Bitcoin versus getting paid
[41:18] in Fiat but I think we're just a little
[41:21] too early to as bitcoiners totally
[41:24] expect that um whereas I
[41:27] given discounts for bitcoiners in the
[41:29] past and um it's worked well but I'm
[41:32] also a hardcore bitcoiner who says uh
[41:37] 10% discount I don't care this is going
[41:38] to be worth 10x in a few years and if I
[41:40] can just hold it I'm great it's just a
[41:42] bigger lift for the companies that are
[41:44] that are new to it um and depending on
[41:47] what you're selling it's it's not quite
[41:49] the right fit um whereas I think it is
[41:53] going to become the norm to give a
[41:54] discount for Bitcoin in the future
[41:57] um I mean there's some uh famous
[42:00] examples uh Ben from BTC sessions was
[42:03] recently on the podcast said he charges
[42:05] a 15% premium if if uh a partner wants
[42:09] to pay in feat um so that's you you can
[42:14] say premium in Fiat or discount in
[42:16] Bitcoin ends up being the same thing um
[42:20] uh Bitcoin BR for example the conference
[42:22] gives a 5% discount if you pay in
[42:25] Bitcoin uh on top of the 10% uh discount
[42:28] if you if you like use a code uh so
[42:32] there is there's things like that uh and
[42:35] I do think H it's it's great from from a
[42:40] uh from a perspective like hey like I I
[42:43] know this Bitcoin thing is more valuable
[42:46] so I'll I'll give you a 5% discount if
[42:48] you give me the valuable thing um
[42:51] because I might like I If if I have a
[42:54] business okay let's make an example with
[42:57] with my U my my business um I get paid
[43:00] in feied and in Bitcoin and those
[43:03] Bitcoin I get I get directly in myself C
[43:05] wallet like there's one step in between
[43:07] for privacy and stuff like that but it's
[43:09] basically directly into Bitcoin uh if I
[43:11] get it in fear I have to uh put that
[43:15] feeld on the exchange The Exchange gets
[43:17] a cut then from that I have to transfer
[43:20] it uh to my wallet there's like fees
[43:22] involved with that uh so uh it it ends
[43:25] up costing me costing me more some fe uh
[43:29] so in in some sense if if you're on a
[43:32] Bitcoin standard it probably makes sense
[43:35] uh to say Bitcoin is a default and I'm
[43:38] charging a premium if you want to pay me
[43:40] in in in Fiat but I understand if you
[43:44] have customers it it might be a weird
[43:47] thing of saying like hey this is the
[43:49] price if you pay me the thing that
[43:50] you're always used to pay
[43:52] me I'm charging a premium I think it's a
[43:56] it's a bad marketing thing uh which you
[43:58] can do as a Bitcoin conference probably
[44:01] uh and and maybe as Ben of BTC sessions
[44:04] you can definitely do it but probably if
[44:06] you want to sell wine or or other
[44:08] businesses I can probably do it as well
[44:11] and it's it's kind of a the difference
[44:14] I'm making here is if we're trying to on
[44:16] board the next wave of businesses onto
[44:20] accepting Bitcoin um and eventually
[44:23] becoming part of our mission um but at
[44:26] least putting their foot in the door I
[44:27] don't think that expecting Bitcoin
[44:29] discounts is really there because they
[44:31] see Bitcoin as volatile risky um and
[44:35] maybe are curious about it and are you
[44:37] know expect the upside and will
[44:38] eventually be part of the mission but um
[44:41] they have expenses and probably not much
[44:44] as far as savings go this is the
[44:46] difference between like the S&P 500
[44:48] companies with tons of dollars on their
[44:50] balance sheet versus the company that's
[44:52] just trying to grow and expand and
[44:54] invest everything back into it um and I
[44:57] I think that like I'm fully into Bitcoin
[45:00] Ben is fully into Bitcoin BTC Pro fully
[45:03] into Bitcoin you're selling the
[45:04] bitcoiners and it's that extra like
[45:08] we're so into Bitcoin that we don't want
[45:10] your dollars like that is a great
[45:12] selling point once you're fully in but I
[45:14] think it's unrealistic for um the next
[45:16] wave of businesses that we're trying to
[45:17] on board to bitcoin um to be there but I
[45:21] think everyone will be I mean that's the
[45:24] idea of good money drives out bad
[45:27] eventually we're not going to want
[45:28] dollars but most people are not there
[45:30] yet most people um and most businesses
[45:33] are just like look if you pay us we're
[45:36] happy and I think we onboard that next
[45:39] bit of bitcoiners by just showing our
[45:41] support for strong businesses that make
[45:43] good products and um hopefully a a small
[45:47] amount of paying with Bitcoin as a bit
[45:49] of like a token gesture uh that maybe I
[45:53] mean this is kind of like the the ironic
[45:55] part is like maybe they haven't figured
[45:57] out how to totally um transfer their
[46:00] Bitcoin to dollars yet or maybe it's
[46:02] just like that extra thing that they
[46:04] kind of forget to do
[46:06] or it's just a few sales they eventually
[46:09] like they kind of you know it's over
[46:10] there they're not looking at at it every
[46:12] day and a few years they come back and
[46:13] they're like oh my God this Bitcoin
[46:15] thing is crazy I'm glad I was accepting
[46:17] that and it's a positive feedback loop
[46:19] to accepting it more um to being louder
[46:21] to marketing towards more bitcoiners bit
[46:23] Corners saying yeah [ __ ] yeah we're into
[46:25] this um and I think it's kind of just
[46:28] yeah as I said it starts this positive
[46:30] feedback loop of U making high quality
[46:33] goods for
[46:34] bitcoiners uh because that's what
[46:35] bitcoiners want and ultimately if we
[46:38] want to live on a Bitcoin standard we
[46:39] need companies to produce things for us
[46:41] and allow us to use Bitcoin absolutely
[46:44] we need uh we need more circular economy
[46:46] we need more spending in Bitcoin we need
[46:48] more Bitcoin acceptance so what okay we
[46:51] say this so um I'm just like just let's
[46:55] get to the heart of issu issue we say we
[46:58] need yeah I think this is going to
[46:59] happen um organically but like what is
[47:02] it that's stopping what I I'm trying to
[47:05] like figure out what is it that's
[47:06] stopping businesses I think it's a a lot
[47:08] of Education about Bitcoin but like what
[47:11] is it that's stopping bitcoiners from
[47:13] doing that is it um I just don't know if
[47:15] you're going to hold on to it is it yo
[47:18] it's G to go up 10x in the next year I
[47:20] don't know if I really want to spend my
[47:21] Bitcoin is it just taxes is it not being
[47:24] comfortable using something like strike
[47:26] um there a lack of opportunity I just
[47:28] it's kind of a like we say we need it
[47:31] but like what what's stopping us I had
[47:34] uh I was uh recently with with Jeff poof
[47:37] on uh Ben's live Friday live stream and
[47:41] it was actually a topic uh and there
[47:43] were like I I saw a chat next to and
[47:45] there were wild discussion on that um I
[47:49] think people people and bitcoiners have
[47:53] one stupid narrative they're saying like
[47:56] oh why would would I sell my Bitcoin if
[47:58] it's so much worth in the future and I'm
[48:01] always saying spending it is not selling
[48:04] it you have uh 100% of your income and
[48:09] if you put uh uh like and you use from
[48:12] that 100% income like I don't know like
[48:14] 70% for uh expenses you have 30% left it
[48:20] doesn't
[48:21] matter what comes in and what comes out
[48:25] uh if you determine everything in
[48:27] Bitcoin you're saving
[48:29] 30% uh like you're spending 30% of your
[48:32] Bitcoin and 70% of your Bitcoin uh you
[48:35] uh saving if you are now spending uh
[48:40] your feared and saving 7% in Bitcoin
[48:43] it's the same reality you you you're
[48:46] saving 70% in Bitcoin um it it does not
[48:50] make a difference if you are uh spending
[48:53] in Bitcoin or in Euros if I I if for
[48:57] example if I had the chance to to pay my
[48:59] landlord in Bitcoin I I would do it to
[49:02] to get on this full um uh full uh
[49:05] Bitcoin circular economy um because I
[49:09] would have I would have to spend that
[49:11] rent anyways it doesn't make it does not
[49:15] make a difference if I spend it in Euros
[49:17] or in Bitcoin if I have 100% all my
[49:20] reserves in
[49:21] Bitcoin why does it matter in what form
[49:25] I pay it it's anyways money going out of
[49:28] my account so I think the difference is
[49:30] is whether you have a buffer um to
[49:33] survive any volatility so you can pay
[49:37] like if if you have a a Fiat buffer
[49:39] between the two I think it's the only
[49:41] Counterpoint to what I would say with
[49:42] you but I mean realistically yeah you
[49:44] are in the better position if you are um
[49:47] all in Bitcoin because you every bit
[49:50] goes up over time I mean from a
[49:52] long-term perspective but shortterm yeah
[49:55] it can cost you a little bit more if
[49:56] you're Force spender on a down day uh
[49:59] but one thing you said there is is like
[50:01] paying your landlord in Bitcoin and I
[50:04] think it's I think where you're what
[50:06] you're not saying is that you have a you
[50:09] would probably have a better
[50:10] relationship and experience with that
[50:12] landlord if you could pay them in
[50:13] Bitcoin and they would probably give you
[50:15] a better service in return both because
[50:18] you know maybe they appreciate it like
[50:20] we're talking about but maybe you're
[50:22] just giving them more financial leeway
[50:25] and when they got to come fix your
[50:27] refrigerator they're not like super
[50:30] destroyed I mean they shouldn't be but
[50:32] like it's not a huge expense for them
[50:33] because they've done say in Bitcoin and
[50:36] uh it's something like with my friends
[50:38] like I'm always trying to pay my
[50:39] friends back or if they help me work or
[50:42] something in Bitcoin because I want my
[50:44] friends to succeed I want the people
[50:46] around me to succeed I live in a small
[50:48] town and want my small town to succeed
[50:51] and that's like sure there's a bit of
[50:53] altruism in that but ultimately it's can
[50:56] be viewed as entirely selfish I don't
[50:58] want to be around a bunch of losers I
[51:00] don't want to be buch around a bunch of
[51:02] people that are destroyed by the Fiat
[51:04] Financial system I want to be around a
[51:05] bunch of people who are able to pursue
[51:07] their dream and do what they're on this
[51:10] world to do and if if we can support
[51:15] those people I think it drives our own
[51:18] personal spot into a better place it
[51:21] it's the voting for the voting with your
[51:23] money for the companies that produce the
[51:24] things you want and it's the people
[51:26] around you not suffering so they can
[51:29] produce things get back to society and
[51:31] increase it and I think it's it's maybe
[51:32] a little bit harder to see if you're in
[51:34] a city um because there's so many people
[51:36] you feel a little bit more powerless to
[51:38] influence the world around you uh but
[51:40] you still have that
[51:42] power it's maybe just a bit I don't know
[51:45] maybe diluted maybe it's just harder to
[51:47] see because there is so much other stuff
[51:48] around but um you as a bitcoiner you
[51:52] whether it's education just giving that
[51:54] bug giving that person a little bit of
[51:56] Bitcoin at the you have the power to
[51:57] influence the world around you capital
[51:59] gain taxes I think might be a valid
[52:02] point an important tool capital gain TX
[52:05] might be a valid point of like okay
[52:08] maybe uh but even there
[52:11] yeah maybe I'm too much on a Bitcoin
[52:13] standard already
[52:15] but uh spending a Bitcoin uh is I think
[52:19] an important uh thing to do long term um
[52:22] one thing before we close up I I want to
[52:25] mention um or like I want to get touch
[52:28] in touch in with you um how do you look
[52:32] at uh businesses that are on a Bitcoin
[52:36] standard that now have to take the
[52:38] decision are we using the Bitcoin stack
[52:41] and it actually comes a little bit in
[52:42] that discussion uh do we expand our
[52:45] business or is it a better strategy to
[52:47] just to hold on to the Bitcoin like my
[52:49] question is like what does change in a
[52:51] business once it has Bitcoin as a hurdle
[52:55] rate because Bitcoin itself grows quite
[52:58] quite good uh every year uh and you have
[53:01] to find an investment that's good enough
[53:03] to outperform and and be better long
[53:07] term than just holding on to those
[53:09] Bitcoin totally it really reprices what
[53:13] you're trying to do with your business
[53:14] and makes you look at everything from a
[53:16] slightly different perspective um you
[53:19] really have to do something that
[53:23] is if it's risky it's got to be really
[53:26] high returns and if it's not that risky
[53:30] it's still got to be pretty high returns
[53:32] to beat Bitcoin so there's a couple ways
[53:34] I think about it is one is what Jack
[53:37] mullers talks about a lot is the
[53:40] 44% numbers changes every day but uh
[53:43] compound annual growth rate of Bitcoin
[53:44] over the last 10 years um the compound
[53:48] annual growth rate over the last four
[53:49] years today is the lowest bitcoin's ever
[53:53] been which is
[53:54] 10% and
[53:57] I mean I'm constantly bullish Bitcoin so
[54:00] it's hard for me to think that that 10%
[54:02] number is um something that I can use
[54:04] going forward so I I air towards wanting
[54:08] to hold as much Bitcoin as possible the
[54:10] other thing is I've started to think
[54:13] about um spending windows in fouryear
[54:15] Cycles which I think is hard for a lot
[54:19] of businesses but as a Wier I have such
[54:21] a low time preference to turnover
[54:23] already that it's maybe a bit easier
[54:26] here uh because I'm aging wide for two
[54:28] years generally before I sell it but the
[54:31] way I think about that
[54:33] is I'm almost like just kind of continue
[54:36] on the path as much as I can maybe small
[54:38] Investments small tweaks in different
[54:39] ways but like really thinking about okay
[54:43] when if the fouryear cycle continues and
[54:45] it's easier to say this as uh the
[54:48] potential fourth year is this year um in
[54:51] Bitcoin but I look at at it for the next
[54:54] year going forward assuming the fourth
[54:55] year or the four-year cycle is I can
[55:00] spend money on my business and buy all
[55:03] the things that I'm probably going to
[55:04] need over the next four years and still
[55:06] feel pretty comfortable outperforming
[55:08] Bitcoin or at least knowing that like I
[55:13] offset that outperformance as much as
[55:15] possible the four-year cycle doesn't
[55:17] continue
[55:18] um I mean I guess it could change but
[55:20] ultimately I think most people think
[55:22] that if fouryear cycle does continue
[55:23] then it's uh pretty aggressive to the
[55:25] upset
[55:27] and uh then like as long as I held
[55:30] Bitcoin I'm happy I mean the the goal is
[55:32] always f as much as possible but as
[55:33] running a business you do have expenses
[55:35] so if you can time it correctly in a
[55:38] four-year cycle or you can just view the
[55:42] calculations of risk return given
[55:45] bitcoin's history I think that those two
[55:48] things put you in a in a better spot to
[55:49] succeed that said like no one can
[55:52] predict Bitcoin and you're taking a risk
[55:54] every time you sell Bitcoin so you
[55:57] better be pretty sure um my like cost
[56:01] production every year producing wine
[56:04] luckily um out forms Bitcoin or it would
[56:08] be kind of hard for me
[56:10] to really uh go through the process of
[56:13] buying a ton of grapes and holding them
[56:15] for two years so I can't really produce
[56:18] cheap wine or it doesn't make sense on a
[56:20] big one standard and I think a lot of
[56:22] businesses are going to continue seeing
[56:23] that that they need to increase the
[56:25] value of their product
[56:27] and when you do that you have to
[56:30] continuously search for people who can
[56:32] afford and increasingly afford yours so
[56:35] you want people who are on the same
[56:36] standard as you but um yeah I've got a
[56:39] lot of um business improvements that I'd
[56:42] like to do this fallish you know going
[56:46] forward um and I don't really see myself
[56:49] having a great opportunity to do that um
[56:51] just base case fouryear cycle continues
[56:54] um for another four years so I'm
[56:56] thinking hard about what is actually
[56:58] worthwhile to um spend some Bitcoin on
[57:01] and improve my business and hopefully
[57:03] have cash flow to buy the bottom and buy
[57:05] the continuous next cycle if there is
[57:07] one um and um just kind of relieve some
[57:12] some spinning pressure right now because
[57:14] I have been so focused on just get as
[57:15] much Bitcoin as
[57:17] possible that that's a life mission get
[57:20] get get as many take as many as possible
[57:23] um we have one question that I ask each
[57:25] and every one of my guests and the
[57:26] question is I think last time when we
[57:28] recorded it wasn't in there uh I started
[57:32] that routine later what can we learn
[57:34] from you besides Bitcoin I love um just
[57:38] kind of small business marketing uh just
[57:41] thinking about about that and um that's
[57:45] kind of what's got me going in Bitcoin
[57:49] and wine making is just like thinking
[57:51] about like individual incentives so um I
[57:55] don't know I find a lot of people are
[57:56] much more interested in starting a a big
[57:58] entrepreneurial venture but I think
[58:01] there are at least in Bitcoin or the
[58:03] people that go on podcast are but I
[58:04] think there's a lot of people looking at
[58:06] starting a mom and pop store and I think
[58:08] that that uh with more expensive cost of
[58:11] capital I think that'll come back as
[58:14] Bitcoin has a decentralizing nature to
[58:17] counter fiat's centralizing nature and
[58:20] uh that's something I'm really
[58:22] passionate about is um mom and pop
[58:24] businesses and the incentives you have
[58:26] have there because it's just a
[58:28] completely different business than
[58:30] anything or um any Tech Investments that
[58:33] we continuously hear about really cool
[58:36] yeah absolutely uh we have an entertain
[58:38] in the podcast uh where the previous
[58:40] guest is asking a question for the next
[58:42] guest without knowing who the next guest
[58:43] actually is and your question from a
[58:45] previous guest is what is the Bitcoin
[58:48] Renaissance uh mean to you I think it's
[58:50] this this continued drive to produce
[58:53] higher quality products because people
[58:56] can afford it and you can't really
[58:57] afford not to uh because the only way
[59:00] you can afford Fiat a race to the bottom
[59:03] and thus we've seen businesses and
[59:05] products race to the bottom and I think
[59:08] that Bottom's been found and if you're
[59:10] continuously still racing towards it I
[59:12] think you're going to lose so the
[59:13] winners of the future are the people
[59:16] that are making higher quality products
[59:17] for people who can who are embracing the
[59:20] Bitcoin standard and I think
[59:24] that that kind of death
[59:26] consumerism and appreciation of what you
[59:29] have just leads to a society with much
[59:32] more soul I do agree a lot really cool
[59:35] thank you so much um Ben for for being
[59:38] on uh before I let you go where can
[59:40] people find you ask your questions maybe
[59:41] also find the
[59:43] wine yeah so I'm on Noster a lot these
[59:47] days and um find me at Ben jman um
[59:52] there's probably some other accounts
[59:54] that are me but um you just DM me if
[59:57] you're ever curious on Twitter Ben
[60:00] Justman as well as well as pane wine peo
[60:04] iny and you can order wine all over the
[60:07] United States on um pyan wine.com or
[60:11] using Noster and um casew at shopster so
[60:17] that's a a cool new implementation that
[60:19] I'm excited to see get going really cool
[60:21] I love that yeah it's it's it's great to
[60:23] see also those Bitcoin businesses that
[60:25] have have been on the podcast for uh now
