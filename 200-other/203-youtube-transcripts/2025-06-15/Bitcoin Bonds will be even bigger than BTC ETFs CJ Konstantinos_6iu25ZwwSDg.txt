[00:00] a lot of people say oh Bitcoin can't go
[00:01] to a million are you kidding me during
[00:03] covid Bitcoin went from 3,000 to 60,000
[00:06] that's 20x based off of lowering
[00:08] interest rates and quantitative easing
[00:09] we're about to go into that right now
[00:11] what would Bitcoin bonds do for for the
[00:13] Bitcoin price action we're talking to a
[00:15] few different sovereigns one of the
[00:17] sovereigns has about 30 billion barrels
[00:20] of oil off of their Shore when they
[00:22] issued a Bitcoin Bond they would be
[00:24] issuing it from their nationalized Oil
[00:26] Company Bitcoin is the best money by far
[00:28] it's an engineered money it's the most
[00:29] prestine for of collateral in the world
[00:31] nothing can compete with it not gold or
[00:32] silver or anything because it's
[00:34] trustless we need to get Bitcoin on our
[00:36] balance sheet and then as we print money
[00:38] nothing is going to grow faster than
[00:39] Bitcoin the difference between inflation
[00:40] and hyperinflation is trust Bitcoin is
[00:43] entering the political realm we the
[00:45] people are fighting against the money
[00:46] changers and they're going to do
[00:47] everything they can in order to maintain
[00:50] control it's not going to be nation
[00:52] states who are the risk-free borrowers
[00:54] in the future in the very near future
[00:56] it's going to be bitcoiners who are the
[00:58] risk-free borrowers that is how you save
[01:00] Social Security that is how you
[01:02] recapitalize the Republic and make
[01:03] Social Security great again that is how
[01:05] you take any government program in any
[01:07] country that is failing and you
[01:09] recapitalize it with Bitcoin
[01:15] bonds do you have any personal
[01:17] highlights for Bitcoin in the last five
[01:20] months yeah so I mean the biggest news
[01:23] since we last spoke was Bitcoin kind of
[01:26] entering the political space especially
[01:28] here in the United States uh RFK coming
[01:31] out and demonstrating his orange pilling
[01:34] um Donald Trump coming out and
[01:37] announcing that if he became president
[01:40] that the United States would become one
[01:41] of the lowest cost energy producers in
[01:43] the world and become a Bitcoin mining
[01:45] Powerhouse and of course the headlines
[01:48] were the the Strategic uh Reserve or
[01:51] stockpile of Bitcoin which amazingly
[01:53] call it Trump derangement syndrome uh I
[01:56] don't know what you call it but United
[01:57] States now moving its Bitcoin at ever
[02:00] since that announcement uh we had
[02:02] 200,000 I think we're just below 200,000
[02:04] now so just so wild to see that Bitcoin
[02:07] is entering the political realm so
[02:09] quickly you know we're like in year 15
[02:12] and a decade ago when I started this was
[02:14] like ah this is not going to happen for
[02:16] a long time you'd be laughed out of the
[02:17] room if you told them that presidential
[02:19] candidates would make it part of their
[02:21] platform uh but here we are uh and and
[02:24] what's amazing about it is that um the
[02:27] conservatives have kind of forced the
[02:29] Liberals to to to say something right
[02:32] you see uh camela coming out trying to
[02:34] do her crypto reset with uh what's his
[02:38] what's his name mark cubin and a whole
[02:40] bunch of those other people getting
[02:41] behind that crypto notice it's crypto
[02:43] for Harris not Bitcoin for Harris crypto
[02:45] for Harris uh and thankfully that's not
[02:48] gaining a lot of traction especially
[02:50] after she came out with price controls
[02:51] and everything but yeah I mean that's
[02:53] the biggest thing for me I think post
[02:55] post having post what we've since we've
[02:57] talked is just Bitcoin
[03:00] becoming like a number one talking point
[03:03] of the political campaign candidates
[03:05] going out of their way to reach out to
[03:07] this constituency which is is to me is a
[03:09] sign of accelerated adoption so it's
[03:12] very exciting to see it's also really
[03:14] exciting I was a little bit surprised
[03:16] how badly the Bitcoin Community took
[03:19] Trump's speech for me it was really a
[03:20] positive speech but I think like people
[03:22] like had so high expectation that he's
[03:25] like oh let's buy a million Bitcoin or
[03:27] something like that but for a future
[03:29] president like I think he's still the
[03:30] leading candidate for the presidential
[03:32] election um him going out and saying all
[03:36] the things he said he literally said
[03:39] Bitcoin do the moon and and and like the
[03:40] memes and all the other things that he
[03:42] said like there a lot of nice things
[03:43] that he said along the way in the speech
[03:46] that has been like that's a really
[03:47] positive sign like a really really
[03:49] bullish sign um are you are you
[03:52] unsatisfied with the reaction with with
[03:54] price and with the community and
[03:55] everything or or did you expected
[03:58] that yeah you know
[04:00] that's a great question because in 2019
[04:03] Trump was president and came out and
[04:04] said that bitcoin's backed by nothing
[04:07] it's just thin air and that the dollar
[04:09] is the best currency in the world and
[04:11] he's the president of the United States
[04:13] so he he you know he's obligated to say
[04:15] that and defend our currency uh and at
[04:18] that time that was disappointed but from
[04:20] where we were then to the statements
[04:22] that he made at the Bitcoin conference
[04:25] uh they show a tremendous advancement in
[04:28] his understanding and I think the
[04:30] biggest mistake actually of the Bitcoin
[04:31] conference itself was to let RFK speak
[04:34] before Trump because he came in and just
[04:37] look I mean no offense to him he sh it
[04:39] should be RFK versus Trump but we don't
[04:42] have democracy here in the United States
[04:44] camela just got shed in with no voting
[04:46] the DNC convention is going on right now
[04:48] she's gonna end up being the nominee
[04:51] with no uh Democratic process so in my
[04:55] opinion you know RFK got screwed over
[04:57] and it really should be him versus Trump
[05:00] but because it's not him versus Trump he
[05:02] could say very extreme things he doesn't
[05:05] have to reach out he doesn't have to be
[05:07] so Centric and reach out to both sides
[05:09] of the aisle so he was able to say some
[05:12] things that we all wished and hoped that
[05:14] Trump was going to say but in reality
[05:16] Trump has to still win he still has to
[05:19] get the votes so he has to be less
[05:22] what's the word I'm Looking For Less uh
[05:24] radical right because that's what the
[05:25] normies will call it they'll call it R
[05:27] you know Trump's radical he wants to buy
[05:28] a million Bitcoin he wants to do that
[05:30] you know if you said some of the things
[05:31] that RFK said then Trump would be be
[05:34] called radical and he was he's still
[05:36] being called radical for some of the
[05:37] things he said and you can see it in the
[05:39] current administration's actions he
[05:41] wants to start a stock a stockpile
[05:42] Reserve they start selling it so they're
[05:45] doing it's like the opposite game and he
[05:47] came out there were a couple good points
[05:49] actually I'd like to touch on because um
[05:51] the first thing was that lowcost energy
[05:53] producer USA Bitcoin mining Powerhouse
[05:56] that understands a a very deep
[05:59] understanding of of bitcoin's second and
[06:01] third order effects for mining you know
[06:03] for those who follow me you know I say
[06:04] that we don't need Green Piece we need
[06:06] orange piece and you know Bitcoin is the
[06:09] only sustainably incentivized uh Network
[06:13] in humanity that's driving energy
[06:15] Technology Innovation when you integrate
[06:18] Bitcoin into the power grid it becomes
[06:20] more secure and understanding that
[06:23] process which I've talked to a few
[06:25] people in the industry and uh I think if
[06:27] you go look at Matt Schultz timeline the
[06:30] um co-founder and chair of uh cleanspark
[06:33] he had a great uh experience in
[06:35] interaction with Trump and he felt
[06:37] confident that Trump understands the
[06:38] benefits of Bitcoin uh and what Bitcoin
[06:41] mining can do for the country and for
[06:42] the security of the grid and for the
[06:44] efficiency of the grid so that's a
[06:46] really big understanding like to go from
[06:49] 2019 hey it's thin air to
[06:52] 2024 hey uh you know we want to tap into
[06:55] our oil we want to become a lowcost
[06:57] energy producer and we want to become a
[06:58] Bitcoin mining
[07:00] Powerhouse why because he understands
[07:02] the benefit of integrating Bitcoin
[07:04] mining into the grid and into the into
[07:06] our our nation's uh system Energy System
[07:09] so that's a that's a really jump big
[07:11] jump forward for him I thought the
[07:13] second thing he said was that he would
[07:15] take advantage of stable coins to uh
[07:18] extend the dominance of the dollar and
[07:21] that was a really big statement and
[07:24] understanding to me that it was kind of
[07:26] like a soft acknowledgement that the
[07:28] dollar has a little bit of an issue
[07:30] right and uh not a couple months ago I
[07:32] spoke at the uh Bitcoin energy Summit in
[07:34] Miami I had the honor to share the panel
[07:36] with uh Congressman Byron Donalds who
[07:38] happens to just be my local
[07:40] representative in Southwest Florida but
[07:42] he sits on the United States Financial
[07:44] Services committee and he told us in the
[07:47] group that on the financial services
[07:48] committee one of the things that they're
[07:50] talking about is the concern over the
[07:53] lack of Demand on us treasuries now this
[07:56] is the financial services committee this
[07:58] is no joke this is like they talk about
[08:00] the most important things and one of the
[08:02] topics is lack of Demand on us
[08:04] treasuries meanwhile the uh Yellen the
[08:07] secretary uh treasury of the treasury is
[08:10] saying that uh you know treasury market
[08:12] is perfectly liquid so you have two like
[08:15] Contracting points there one is well
[08:18] wait there's a we're concerned about the
[08:19] the lack of Demand on treasuries and the
[08:21] other one says Ah everything is fine so
[08:23] for Trump to say that there has to be
[08:25] some whisper in the bra in the
[08:27] background to understand that if they
[08:29] get this stable coin Bill attach to some
[08:31] bigger Bill and push it through then
[08:33] stable coins will be required to be
[08:35] backed one to one by us cash equivalence
[08:38] or cash so basically us treasury debt
[08:41] and that's really important because in
[08:43] their mind it creates Demand on us
[08:46] treasuries now kind of like going off a
[08:49] little caveat here and I'm apologized
[08:50] but I have to do this because I find
[08:52] this so interesting and nobody's talking
[08:53] about it but I wrote a threat on this a
[08:56] year ago literally last August about St
[08:59] coins and and what's going on is
[09:02] responsible legislation is going to
[09:05] reveal irresponsible regulation because
[09:08] what we have is a fully backed Reserve
[09:10] model with stable coins versus the
[09:14] famous fractional Reserve banking system
[09:16] the central banking system that a lot of
[09:18] bitcoiners are saying hey you know this
[09:20] creates a lot of the problems and it
[09:22] does but now we have uh the potential in
[09:25] the United States for people to have a
[09:27] decision to make if they pass the stable
[09:29] coin Bill and you have one to one
[09:31] guarantees uhoh now we have Bank
[09:33] deposits and now we have uh stable coins
[09:37] so would you like to keep your dollars
[09:39] in a bank where they're backed by one
[09:41] penny to 10 cents and you can only
[09:43] access them when we say and you can only
[09:45] access them with our permission and by
[09:47] the way if you need money on Sunday you
[09:49] better come to the ATM on Saturday uh
[09:51] and if you need more than $10,000 you
[09:53] better email us and let us know so that
[09:55] we can set up an appointment to get you
[09:57] $10,000 of cash right so you have all
[10:00] these limitations plus all the
[10:02] additional risk of it only really being
[10:03] backed by the bank's assets which range
[10:06] from a penny to 10 cents and then of
[10:08] course FDIC but then if FDIC gets
[10:10] triggered you talk about inflation right
[10:12] going back to the bank term funding
[10:13] program with the Silicon Valley Bank how
[10:15] they fix it inflation so it's really not
[10:18] insured it's really not secured and then
[10:19] you look at the stablecoin model and you
[10:21] say Hey you can have
[10:24] 247365 access to liquidity you can move
[10:27] it whenever you want without anybody's
[10:29] permission
[10:30] and most importantly by law if the
[10:32] stable coin bill passes by law it will
[10:35] be backed one to one so you know in my
[10:39] personal opinion uh astute money
[10:41] managers Left Bank deposits and ran for
[10:43] the money market funds to get the
[10:45] interest right because the banks that
[10:47] was the the essence of the problem the
[10:49] banks took the deposits they bought the
[10:51] US government debt the interest rates
[10:54] Rose people wanted their money but the
[10:56] mark to market value on the underlying
[10:58] collateral the asset was less than the
[11:00] liability they did not have the money to
[11:02] give back to the customer to bring to
[11:03] another bank or to bring to the money
[11:05] market fund they didn't have the
[11:07] corresponding asset to transfer so they
[11:09] needed the bank term funding program so
[11:11] they could post the collateral at par
[11:13] value so that they could then make the
[11:15] transfer of the asset with the liability
[11:17] to the money market fund and that was
[11:20] just to earn interest but imagine you
[11:22] know that was like a bank run I think if
[11:24] you get stable coins legally here in the
[11:26] United States which Trump made it seem
[11:29] like he's you know that's one of his
[11:30] missions if he gets in he's going to
[11:32] expand the dominance of the dollar with
[11:34] stable coins and if that's the case
[11:36] scenario we might go from a bank run due
[11:39] to interest rates to a bank Sprint due
[11:41] to the the extra security of a onetoone
[11:44] reserve plus all the additional freedoms
[11:46] and benefits you get with the stable
[11:47] coin model versus the fractional Reserve
[11:50] model so that you know that was I was
[11:52] surprised he said that I was like whoa
[11:54] this is you know maybe this is Trump
[11:56] taking a shot back at those money Chang
[11:59] at those Central Bankers who took a shot
[12:01] at him not too long ago uh to come out
[12:04] and and put the the fractional Reserve
[12:05] business model at risk I always thought
[12:07] it was going to be Bitcoin that would
[12:09] end the fractional Reserve business
[12:10] model it very well may be stable coins
[12:12] that ends up being the death blow to
[12:14] fractional Reserve banking it's also
[12:17] interesting when you look at other
[12:18] countries that already have a US dollar
[12:21] standard and then you also have other
[12:23] countries that doesn't have the US
[12:25] dollars but for example would need the
[12:27] US dollar uh or they would need Bitcoin
[12:30] but they would also benefit a lot from
[12:32] the US dollar medium term for example
[12:34] turkey with the Turkish l i mean the US
[12:36] dollar is EXT way better than the
[12:39] Turkish l in any Matrix um could that
[12:43] lead to like a a a showdown where the US
[12:47] dollar expands their um reach to the
[12:51] whole world uh with the US dollar as
[12:54] like all the weaker currencies then will
[12:57] have a major incentive to just get on a
[12:59] new stable coin US dollar and then maybe
[13:04] thinking that uh question a little bit
[13:06] further if everything actually goes to
[13:09] the US dollar and there's just one feat
[13:11] currency which would be um weird thing
[13:15] to have but maybe also impossible but
[13:18] maybe let's let's come on that after
[13:19] that um would that lead then to a
[13:22] showdown between Bitcoin and US dollar
[13:24] in in the end of the day between what is
[13:27] the major store of value and unit of
[13:30] account uh and Med of exchange for the
[13:32] world yeah oh that's a beautifully
[13:35] framed question because it just it
[13:36] covers so much I probably have like five
[13:38] points that I want to make I'm not even
[13:39] sure if I'm going to remember them all
[13:41] but the first thing is is that it's
[13:43] interesting because it isn't C it is a
[13:45] Counterpoint to what brics is doing
[13:47] right we know brics is like organizing
[13:49] together they're about to uh launch
[13:51] their new payment system from what I've
[13:54] heard it's going to be a basket of all
[13:55] the bricks currencies with the reserve
[13:57] being gold and this is
[14:00] like this is what's creating a lot of
[14:03] lack of Demand on the dollar is that
[14:05] there's now alternative options so this
[14:07] is an interesting Counterpoint to you
[14:10] know what can the dollar start to do to
[14:12] get back some of that demand if we're
[14:15] stuck in a situation where we have to
[14:17] continue to run deficit budgets and
[14:19] unfortunately there is no way out of
[14:21] running the deficit budget that I think
[14:23] is one of the biggest misunderstandings
[14:25] I've seen in the US government and
[14:27] especially by US citizens
[14:29] and and of course people who who aren't
[14:31] paying close enough attention because uh
[14:34] the first thing you hear them say is
[14:35] well the government just needs to stop
[14:36] spending yeah but if you analyze the US
[14:39] government
[14:41] budget there's what's called
[14:42] discretionary and non-discretionary or
[14:44] in other words mandatory spending uh and
[14:47] non-mandatory spending and the the
[14:51] Congress gets to vote on the
[14:52] non-mandatory spending but what's
[14:55] amazing is uh some of the mandatory
[14:57] spending is like social security uh
[15:00] Medicare interest those are like the top
[15:02] three expenses right now in the United
[15:04] States you you can't not pay for those
[15:07] things you need those things to be paid
[15:08] or else there's going to be social
[15:10] unrest number one if you don't pay
[15:12] social security we're going to have huge
[15:14] problems here in the United States it's
[15:16] kind of like a entrenched Ponzi scheme
[15:18] that needs to be addressed and hopefully
[15:20] we'll we'll dive into that a little bit
[15:21] later with Bitcoin bonds uh the second
[15:23] thing is the the net interest cost you
[15:25] can't pay interest you'll default on
[15:27] your loans you you're you that would be
[15:29] like the end of it all so you definitely
[15:31] can't do that and then uh finally uh
[15:33] Medicare and that's another big thing
[15:35] where you know the quality of life and
[15:37] standard of living would go so low there
[15:39] would be civil unrest just like with
[15:40] social security so these the three
[15:42] biggest costs in the US government are
[15:45] and then behind that it's the military
[15:47] but then but those biggest costs are
[15:49] mandatory spending you have to spend
[15:51] that money so you say okay well what can
[15:53] the government cut because that's a lot
[15:54] a lot of these people come out and say
[15:55] the government can just cut spending no
[15:57] they can't because even they got rid of
[15:59] all non-mandatory spending and and when
[16:01] I say all of it I mean all of it CIA FBI
[16:06] Department of Education Department of
[16:07] Human Safety and Health Services
[16:10] everything every single government
[16:13] service being absolutely closed down
[16:17] 100% And the US government still does
[16:20] not collect enough taxes to run a budget
[16:23] surplus so there is no option for the US
[16:25] government to cut spending in order to
[16:29] have a budget surplus that is the
[16:31] essence of the problem that we are here
[16:33] in the United States our mandatory
[16:35] spending is greater than our tax revenue
[16:39] so we have to run a budget deficit and
[16:41] since we have to run a budget deficit
[16:44] that drives away demand because that
[16:46] creates inflation the deficit is
[16:48] financed through debt monetization which
[16:50] is inflation and that sucks value from
[16:53] the currency and that drives away demand
[16:56] and where are they going well they're
[16:57] going to this this apparently they're
[16:58] going to go to Brick's alternative
[17:00] payment system well it's kind of like a
[17:03] blessing that bricks decided to back
[17:05] their currency basket with gold because
[17:08] they went to the to the old natural
[17:10] money because I guess the idea is well
[17:13] it's two things number one it could be
[17:14] misdirection they haven't really
[17:15] officially announced everything yet and
[17:17] we don't know all the specific details
[17:19] it's just speculation at this point so
[17:21] maybe they're talking about gold but in
[17:23] the background they are actually doing
[17:25] something with Bitcoin I don't know I
[17:27] hope not because I don't want to see um
[17:31] the fall of America happen so quickly I
[17:33] love the Constitution I love the our
[17:35] freedoms being protected by the law of
[17:37] the land and even though they're under
[17:38] attack they are protected here and
[17:40] they're not protected anywhere else you
[17:42] see people getting arrested in the UK
[17:44] for doing retweets I mean you know the
[17:46] rest of the world has pretty much
[17:48] capitulated that's why the under that's
[17:49] why the United States is under attack so
[17:51] much but now you have bricks backing
[17:53] with gold and they go to the Natural
[17:55] money and that's that's interesting
[17:57] because Bitcoin is the techn Tech
[17:59] olical evolution of money it's the
[18:02] engineered money uh and and that gives
[18:04] United States an option to actually
[18:07] adopt Bitcoin so if bricks adopted
[18:09] Bitcoin I feel like we'd be like in a
[18:10] lot of trouble but because they're going
[18:12] with gold it actually leaves this thing
[18:15] open number one okay let's get our
[18:17] stable coins out there let's get these
[18:19] people the ability to get access to our
[18:22] dollars like you were saying the Turkish
[18:24] L Argentine uh there's there's plenty of
[18:28] countries all around the world because
[18:30] every single country is abusing the
[18:31] printer it's not just the United States
[18:33] every single country is extracting value
[18:36] from their citizenry via inflation so
[18:39] it's a it's a global problem uh not just
[18:42] local to the dollar but their problems
[18:45] are a lot worse because they're not the
[18:47] reserve currency and they're not what
[18:49] the global debt is basically issued in
[18:53] dollars it's it's a dollar denominated
[18:55] debt and then the currency markets you
[18:57] can hedge upside and down side with all
[18:59] the derivative tools that exist so this
[19:02] this system is so entrenched and the
[19:04] dollar is so powerful um because of all
[19:07] the tools that are built around it and
[19:08] if we gave that up then we'd be in a lot
[19:11] of trouble because we're the financial
[19:12] service committee is already talking
[19:14] about a lack of Demand on treasuries now
[19:16] you now you move away from that there's
[19:17] going to be even further lack of demand
[19:19] but if we can go if we can turn to
[19:20] bitcoin and we can integrate Bitcoin we
[19:23] can get an advantage on bricks and this
[19:25] could be a big this could be a big move
[19:27] for dollar dominance going far into the
[19:29] future and I'm starting to see Bitcoin
[19:32] be more of a complimentary asset I want
[19:35] to say money right Bitcoin is money and
[19:37] the dollar is currency so we can't
[19:39] confuse the dollar as currency like a
[19:41] currency doesn't fight with money money
[19:44] is money and Bitcoin is the best money
[19:46] by far it's an engineered money it's the
[19:48] most pristine form of collateral in the
[19:49] world nothing can compete with it not
[19:51] gold or silver or anything because it's
[19:53] trustless right that's the that's one of
[19:55] the big moves it's not just about finite
[19:57] Supply and the difficult adjustment and
[19:59] the things we talked about previously
[20:01] it's also about there being no trust
[20:03] right nodes trust nobody so that we can
[20:05] trust anybody well if bricks has a gold
[20:08] payment system they still have to trust
[20:10] the where the gold is you still Russia
[20:11] still has to trust China and China has
[20:13] to trust India and India has to trust
[20:15] Africa and there still requires trust
[20:17] and there also still requires large cost
[20:20] to security and settlement between those
[20:23] Nations uh so it's not really a solution
[20:26] bitcoin's the solution and it's the
[20:27] money solution but think it really
[20:29] defines the dollar as currency and we
[20:31] can have a a money with a currency um
[20:35] living together and working together and
[20:38] the and the dollar could really become
[20:39] almost a derivative of of Bitcoin not a
[20:42] direct derivative like paper debt notes
[20:45] were of gold but in in one way or
[20:48] another and what do I mean by that I
[20:49] mean that if Bitcoin adds bit uh itself
[20:53] to the United States balance sheet like
[20:55] Donald Trump was saying with a strategic
[20:57] stockpile or Reserve
[20:59] well that fixed the biggest problem that
[21:01] we have because we are forced deficit
[21:04] spending is actually making the
[21:06] liability side of our balance sheet grow
[21:10] faster than the asset side of our
[21:11] balance sheet and everybody is focused
[21:13] on the liability side of the balance
[21:15] sheet oh well we can cut spending well
[21:16] no we can't oh well we can do this or we
[21:18] can do that it's it's funny because
[21:21] nobody's really paying attention to the
[21:22] asset side of the balance sheet and the
[21:24] excuse is always the the economy so it's
[21:27] like oh well the economy grows then
[21:31] we'll be okay we can outgrow the debt so
[21:34] the mindset is there the understanding
[21:37] of the importance of the asset side of
[21:38] the balance sheet is there but the focus
[21:40] Still Remains on the liability side of
[21:41] the balance sheet what I think Bitcoin
[21:43] is going to do is it's going to start to
[21:45] bring attention back to that asset side
[21:47] of the balance sheet because it's the
[21:49] only option we really have the United
[21:52] States borrows
[21:53] $1 and then spends it into the economy
[21:56] to create less than $1 worth of economic
[21:59] growth so that's why the liability side
[22:01] of the balance sheet is growing faster
[22:03] than the asset side of the balance sheet
[22:05] and the economy itself well you
[22:07] shouldn't be surprised when you deflate
[22:09] GDP when you deflate nominal GDP by the
[22:13] real inflation rate not by the reported
[22:15] CPI rate then real GDP has been negative
[22:18] since uh the second quarter of 2022
[22:22] which is in the first quarter of 2022
[22:23] the the Federal Reserve started raising
[22:25] interest rates and they said we're doing
[22:28] this to cause demand destruction so
[22:29] nobody should be surprised when it
[22:32] caused demand destruction from that
[22:33] point forward there's a little bit of a
[22:35] lag right because we didn't see it until
[22:36] after the following quarter but after
[22:38] that little bit of a lag the economy
[22:40] started to contract and we've been we'
[22:43] we've now gone through nine consecutive
[22:45] quarters of
[22:47] contraction the definition of a
[22:49] recession is two consecutive quarters of
[22:51] negative GDP so we've been in a
[22:53] recession for quite some time with nine
[22:55] consecutive quarters of slightly
[22:56] negative GDP three more quarters of
[22:59] negative GDP and the United States will
[23:02] fit the textbook definition of a
[23:04] depression because a depression is three
[23:07] years or 12 consecutive quarters of
[23:09] negative GDP so we shouldn't be
[23:12] surprised that the Federal Reserve
[23:13] raising interest rates brought about
[23:15] that result that was the goal of that
[23:17] campaign and now when we look at it and
[23:21] we say well wait a second the economy is
[23:23] shrinking that means our tax revenues
[23:24] are going to go down well that means the
[23:26] deficit is going to increase which
[23:27] liabilities are to increase even more
[23:29] than the asset side of our balance sheet
[23:31] now couple things we got going for us is
[23:33] we have the best most robust Capital
[23:36] Market in the world so that helps uh and
[23:39] the second thing we have is oil and that
[23:41] was another thing that that ties right
[23:43] into Bitcoin Trump said lowcost energy
[23:45] producer how by tapping into the oil and
[23:48] interestingly the United States I just
[23:49] learned this this morning actually I saw
[23:52] I I forget who posted it but over the
[23:54] last six years the United States has
[23:56] been the largest producer of crude o oil
[23:58] in the world even bigger than Russia and
[24:00] Saudi Arabia so I'm not sure how much
[24:04] tapping into that oil is really going to
[24:05] help since we've been the largest
[24:07] producer of crude oil for the last six
[24:09] years but we do have that oil we are
[24:11] sitting on a lot of oil and we can tap
[24:13] into that so we have Capital markets oil
[24:15] and and a strong economy for the tax
[24:18] revenues that's pretty much the asset
[24:20] side of our balance sheet that's all we
[24:21] got working for us the liability side we
[24:24] have $35 trillion in debt $217 trillion
[24:28] of unfunded
[24:30] liabilities uh and it's not looking it's
[24:32] not looking too good because we have
[24:33] growing deficits because of that demand
[24:35] destruction campaign lowering tax
[24:37] revenues and increasing deficits so the
[24:40] question becomes what can we do if if we
[24:43] can borrow a dollar and we create less
[24:46] than one doar of economic growth and
[24:48] then we only get 15 to 20% tax on that
[24:51] economic growth so you're not even
[24:53] getting a one to one that's that's a big
[24:55] thing behind AI people well when AI
[24:57] kicks in the economy is going to ramp up
[24:59] big time so you know AI will add a
[25:02] trillion to our economy so we can add a
[25:04] trillion to our debt it's not a problem
[25:06] yeah but the government doesn't get the
[25:07] full benefit of the trillion added to
[25:09] the economy they only get that 15 to 20%
[25:11] of tax revenue from that trillion so you
[25:13] need you need four five times six times
[25:16] more uh economic growth than you do
[25:19] liability growth in order for the tax
[25:21] revenues to match the amount of money
[25:23] being borrowed and spent into the
[25:25] economy for it just to be equal just to
[25:27] keep things just to keep debt to GDP
[25:29] where it is right now and then you say
[25:31] well what about real estate well real
[25:33] estate is a multi hundred trillion
[25:35] dollar asset class you can't print
[25:36] enough money to to prop up that value to
[25:40] get assets to support liabilities what
[25:42] about gold well you know that's that's
[25:43] an interesting concept on gold because
[25:45] we see bricks going the gold route and
[25:48] you hear a lot of gold bugs say this
[25:50] what if they just repriced gold to
[25:52] $50,000 okay but when you reprice gold
[25:54] to
[25:55] $50,000 it doesn't change the cost of
[25:57] production to rip out the gold of the
[25:59] ground and provide it to the marketplace
[26:01] so that increase in significant increase
[26:03] in profitability they will literally be
[26:06] renting Elon musk's rocket ships to go
[26:09] into space to go get those big uh
[26:12] asteroids that are made of gold to bring
[26:13] them back to Earth because that's how
[26:15] much profit they'll have because the
[26:16] cost of production will still be 2,000
[26:18] instead of it trading for $2,500 with a
[26:21] $500 uh profit you'll have $49,500 of
[26:25] profit per ounce well you what that's
[26:28] going to create uh uh an expansion of
[26:31] Supply it's one of the reasons that
[26:32] absolute digital scarcity in Bitcoin is
[26:35] so important of a concept because there
[26:37] is no Supply expansion only hash rate
[26:39] can supply which pushes up difficulty so
[26:41] even gold can't rebalance the balance
[26:43] sheet and then uh even though it's a$1
[26:46] 15 trillion dollar asset class right so
[26:48] it's a smaller asset class relative to
[26:50] real estate but there's still not
[26:51] anything you can really do to bolster
[26:54] the asset side of our balance sheet so
[26:55] what the heck can we do what can we do
[26:58] and that's that's the problem I want
[27:00] people to wake up to you know I said all
[27:02] that so that people can say wait a
[27:03] second you know maybe this isn't isn't
[27:05] all about the deficit spending it's not
[27:07] all about the liability side we can
[27:09] focus on the asset side and if we take
[27:12] Bitcoin and listen to Trump uh or
[27:15] whoever gets in there to make that
[27:16] decision I don't really care who it is
[27:18] whoever says they're going to promise to
[27:19] get in there and make Bitcoin a
[27:20] strategic Reserve that's who I'm going
[27:22] to vote for because that's what we need
[27:24] we need to get Bitcoin on our balance
[27:25] sheet and then as we print money nothing
[27:28] is going to grow faster than Bitcoin a
[27:30] trillion dollars into Bitcoin or a bill
[27:33] like Senator Lumis from Wyoming if some
[27:36] if Trump did the Strategic reserve and
[27:39] then that bill passed through Congress
[27:41] and the now the US government is
[27:42] starting to stack Bitcoin to get up to
[27:44] that 1 million Bitcoin goal to later
[27:46] then be extended and to build the the
[27:48] asset side of your balance sheet the
[27:50] amount of equity value that will be
[27:51] driven into the asset side of your
[27:53] balance sheet will actually strengthen
[27:55] the dollar and we see that in El
[27:57] Salvador is what's happening in El
[27:59] Salvador El Salvador is buying Bitcoin
[28:03] and every day they buy Bitcoin and then
[28:05] as the price of Bitcoin goes up over
[28:07] time the asset side of their balance
[28:09] sheet is growing faster than the
[28:11] liability side of their balance sheet
[28:13] it's the opposite of what we have here
[28:15] in the United States and most countries
[28:16] around the world and that's why JP
[28:19] Morgan and all the Credit Agencies and
[28:21] even the IMF who hates El Salvador and
[28:24] wants them to be a debt slave like the
[28:25] rest of us is getting so pissed off but
[28:28] they still have to raise the credit
[28:29] score of El Salvador because the asset
[28:31] side of their balance sheet is growing
[28:33] faster than the liability side it's less
[28:35] risky to lend to them than to other
[28:38] people whose liabilities are growing
[28:40] faster than their assets so just a
[28:42] really interesting Dynamic coming to
[28:44] play that nobody's really talking about
[28:46] in the space and I I I love Peter
[28:48] dunworth because he's dived into it and
[28:50] he you know he's put on a Bitcoin master
[28:52] class on how we need the asset side of
[28:54] the balance sheet to grow faster than
[28:56] the liability side not just here in the
[28:58] United States but for all countries who
[29:01] are abusing their citizenry and
[29:03] extracting value through inflation it's
[29:05] it's funny that you mentioned Peter
[29:07] dumru because it was literally the
[29:09] previous guest
[29:11] like the previous recording was with
[29:13] Peter and you also get his his question
[29:16] and there's a lot of really interesting
[29:18] points there um do you think uh that
[29:22] Bitcoin might be even able to save the
[29:25] US dollar and maybe extend
[29:28] uh uh the life of dollar and and fat
[29:31] currencies when they are backed properly
[29:33] with with Bitcoin to a very long uh time
[29:37] frame or even
[29:39] forever I do I do think that I think
[29:42] that if the if we start adding Bitcoin
[29:43] to the asset side of our balance sheet
[29:46] that makes the trust Trend change right
[29:49] I I I believe we said it last time we
[29:50] talked about the collapse of Rome and
[29:53] how do we Define inflation to
[29:55] hyperinflation the textbooks try to
[29:57] Define it mathematically but in my
[29:59] studies you can't do that right and we
[30:02] dove into all that how it's different
[30:03] with each society and culture and
[30:05] economy but the one thing that was the
[30:07] same across all of those areas Greece
[30:09] Rome Weimar uh Argentina Venezuela the
[30:13] loss of trust right in Venezuela they
[30:15] had an election nobody trusted the
[30:17] results their currency lays worthless in
[30:20] the streets in Argentina Malay W people
[30:23] still trusted the results even though
[30:25] they've printed enough for that currency
[30:27] to be letting and sitting in the streets
[30:29] it's not what's the difference trust so
[30:32] the difference between inflation and
[30:33] hyperinflation is trust so the trust
[30:37] trend for Fiat currencies is going down
[30:39] because the trust Trend in governments
[30:41] is going down however if you get the
[30:43] government to start adding Bitcoin to
[30:45] the asset side of their balance sheet
[30:47] that could actually reverse the trend we
[30:49] could see trust start to rebound so that
[30:52] people would have more confidence in the
[30:54] country and more confidence in what
[30:56] backs the currency because we have real
[30:58] world Assets in this case real world
[31:00] digital asset that is supporting the
[31:04] liability side of our balance sheet
[31:05] because it's the it's the explosion of
[31:07] the liability side of our balance sheet
[31:10] that leads to the loss of trust and it's
[31:12] the loss of trust that changes us from
[31:14] inflation to hyperinflation so if you
[31:16] add Bitcoin as an asset to the balance
[31:18] sheet and you start to grow the asset
[31:20] side of your balance sheet faster than
[31:22] the liability side I would trust them
[31:24] more now I wouldn't trust them to stop
[31:26] printing I wouldn't I wouldn't try to
[31:28] save in the dollar I mean it's a
[31:30] currency it's a medium of exchange it's
[31:33] not a store value there's a big
[31:35] difference there so you still have to
[31:36] remember the fundamental difference
[31:37] between money versus currency but I'm
[31:40] going to trust that currency a lot more
[31:42] than I do right now as the liability
[31:44] side rapidly outpaces the asset side of
[31:47] the balance sheet so I do think it would
[31:49] be a mechanism for adding more trust and
[31:52] elongating uh the dominance of the
[31:54] medium of exchange uh being Fiat
[31:57] currencies all throughout the
[32:00] world I 100% agree uh with you the only
[32:03] thing that I I have a hard time R my
[32:05] ring my head around this long term when
[32:08] we actually come to the point where you
[32:11] have the US Dollars and you have a
[32:13] Bitcoin as the backing of the US dollar
[32:16] or at least like reserves uh of of the
[32:18] US dollars is in Bitcoin uh and it's
[32:22] publicly known it's it's something that
[32:24] more people are aware of and then you
[32:27] can also use Bitcoin as like a global
[32:30] digital currency basically uh unless
[32:33] with gold with gold it's it's hard to
[32:35] transfer gold from uh me Austria to to
[32:38] you in in in America but we can really
[32:40] quickly make a Bitcoin transaction uh
[32:42] and we have final settlement in like 10
[32:44] minutes uh or or less even um so
[32:49] like what's stopping then the the
[32:52] Bitcoin to completely overtake the fear
[32:54] currencies if uh fear currencies is just
[32:57] like Bitcoin with a little bit extra
[33:00] power to the government little bit extra
[33:02] printed to to the
[33:04] Bitcoin right now so right now it's
[33:06] medium of exchange and that's the
[33:08] biggest threat to bitcoin because in the
[33:10] long run I do want a Bitcoin standard
[33:12] and I am cheering on a Bitcoin standard
[33:15] and I'm a Bitcoin maximalist so I don't
[33:16] want people to misinterpret this as oh
[33:19] you know I I want the government to
[33:20] still be able to extract value from my
[33:23] fellow citizens by printing money I'm
[33:25] strongly against that I stand against
[33:27] that we're just Game Theory right here
[33:28] we're just trying to figure out how this
[33:30] process is going to work and the biggest
[33:32] problem for Bitcoin right now is medium
[33:34] of exchange right so you look back at
[33:36] gold and gold started out as a store of
[33:39] value now it took hundreds of years for
[33:42] gold to become the dominant store value
[33:45] Bitcoin has done it in 15 years less
[33:47] than 15 years really so it's the the
[33:49] pace and and acceleration of what's
[33:51] happening is beautiful to see and I'm
[33:53] cheering it on but the brick wall that
[33:55] we're hitting right now is
[33:58] is evolving from a medium of exchange or
[34:02] excuse me from a store value and then
[34:04] adding that Medium of exchange component
[34:07] right because you look at gold it was a
[34:09] store value but we had a problem it was
[34:13] not a good medium of exchange that you
[34:15] could not get the type of monetary
[34:17] velocity uh in order to support rapid
[34:20] economic growth and expansion because if
[34:22] you went into the store you have to
[34:23] weigh it out you have to you know melt
[34:26] it down I mean there it's to do that
[34:27] that and it slowed things down so it
[34:29] limited monetary velocity so gold needed
[34:32] an L2 solution isn't it funny right now
[34:34] Bitcoin needs an L2 solution gold needed
[34:36] an L2 solution too and what was that
[34:39] solution paper notes and Bank deposits
[34:42] right so debt notes or checks written
[34:44] against the gold that was held at the
[34:45] bank and then when that happened gold
[34:48] very quickly became the medium of
[34:50] exchange and soon after that it was
[34:53] adopted as the universal unit of account
[34:55] so Bitcoin is is is right where gold was
[35:00] as it was trying to establish itself as
[35:02] the best medium of exchange by far
[35:05] without competition right because now
[35:07] we're going we're moving from Barter uh
[35:10] into just a complete currency system
[35:12] that paper currency system was gold L L2
[35:15] and it worked it worked beautifully and
[35:17] now and now Bitcoin isn't that same
[35:19] thing and we see lightning Network we
[35:21] see liquid we see l2s like Stacks with
[35:24] their sbtc and no no one solution is is
[35:27] going to win there's going to be you
[35:29] know each one of those Solutions is
[35:31] better for a certain scenario or a
[35:33] certain problem than another one so the
[35:35] free market will use what they what what
[35:37] best fits the the problem that they're
[35:39] trying to to defeat uh and and delivers
[35:42] the most value to them so it's an open
[35:44] market with with many different types of
[35:46] solutions that will work at the same
[35:48] time concurrently There's No One winner
[35:51] but we're trying to figure out how do we
[35:53] make it make sense for me to buy coffee
[35:55] with my Bitcoin how do we make it make
[35:57] sense to to uh increase monetary
[35:59] velocity without increasing block size
[36:02] because we can't increase block size
[36:03] because then you give up
[36:04] decentralization and that that destroys
[36:06] the whole thing so you you have to keep
[36:08] blocks the way they are should block
[36:10] size should not even be part of the
[36:11] discussion ever because we need to keep
[36:13] those nodes very easy and cheap to set
[36:15] up and run that's what affords the the
[36:18] decentralization so that's a you can't
[36:20] go that direction so since we can't go
[36:22] that direction we need some type of L2
[36:25] we need some type of way to increased
[36:28] velocity uh and you can't do it on chain
[36:31] just to you know the sheer am matter
[36:33] amount of transactions would not be able
[36:34] to be fit into the blocks so we need a
[36:37] way to do this in order to open up that
[36:41] Medium of Exchange Route and what's so
[36:43] interesting is that yeah you could use a
[36:46] lightning and you could then buy coffee
[36:48] with your Bitcoin
[36:50] but isn't it better to borrow some
[36:54] dollars against your Bitcoin create zero
[36:57] tax obligation right so capital gains
[37:00] tax that's a big obstacle to medium of
[37:02] exchange because now when I go buy my
[37:05] coffee hey it's fantastic it cost me sub
[37:08] pennies right cost me less than a penny
[37:09] to send that transaction on some L2
[37:13] however I'm G to get taxed on that
[37:15] because now I've just sold it and I had
[37:17] a capital gain you know I might have
[37:19] bought that Bitcoin for five cents and I
[37:20] just bought a $7 coffee well I need to
[37:23] pay capital gains on on the on the
[37:24] difference between the five cents and
[37:26] the7 do I just spent so capital gains
[37:28] tax on bitcoin is a huge obstacle to it
[37:32] becoming a medium of exchange so right
[37:35] now it makes more sense because of that
[37:38] capital gains but also because of the
[37:40] dynamic of the marketplace because the
[37:43] governments are still forced to deficit
[37:45] spend I want to hold my Bitcoin right
[37:48] that's where we get the the saying
[37:49] hoddle don't ever sell your Bitcoin and
[37:52] right now and with the Dynamics in this
[37:54] Marketplace I'm sorry if you have to
[37:55] sell your Bitcoin you should never be
[37:57] selling your Bitcoin what has Michael
[37:59] saor showed us you don't sell your
[38:01] Bitcoin you sell dollars and then you
[38:04] take those dollars and you buy Bitcoin
[38:05] because the compounding annual growth
[38:07] rate of Bitcoin is going to be higher
[38:10] than the amount of interest you need to
[38:12] pay to access those dollars therefore
[38:14] you profit so profit is drives the
[38:17] Invisible Hand of the marketplace profit
[38:18] creates incentives and right now we are
[38:21] incentivized not to use Bitcoin as a
[38:24] medium of exchange because one we get
[38:26] hit with the capital gains and two it
[38:28] makes more sense to borrow the currency
[38:30] borrow the dollars against your Bitcoin
[38:33] escape the tax obligation and then over
[38:36] time it it's really like a
[38:37] self-repairing loan that's where
[38:39] people's reserved self-repairing
[38:40] mortgage idea even comes from because
[38:42] the the kager of Bitcoin outpaces your
[38:44] liability right your asset grows faster
[38:47] than your liability therefore at the end
[38:49] of it you're in a better position so
[38:51] these are some of the obstacles I think
[38:52] that Bitcoin faces in dominating the
[38:56] dollar but also now the question becomes
[38:59] well which Which Way empowers me more am
[39:01] I more empowered if I can spend my
[39:03] Bitcoin to buy my coffee or am I more
[39:06] empowered to borrow dollars against my
[39:09] Bitcoin and then buy the coffee and
[39:11] right now the answer is clear as day it
[39:13] makes much more sense to borrow against
[39:15] your Bitcoin because again you you
[39:16] escape tax obligation and the the loan
[39:20] is basically free you get to P pull
[39:22] forward some of your purchasing power at
[39:24] a negative carry rate so for those
[39:26] reasons
[39:27] it's going to it's going to be hard for
[39:30] Bitcoin to take the place of currency
[39:33] for for that money to also serve as a
[39:35] currency in the near future now like I
[39:38] said in the long-term future I hope the
[39:40] Dynamics change I hope we get some
[39:42] politicians in there that end capital
[39:44] gains tax on bitcoin and then that
[39:46] really starts to open up and make more
[39:48] sense for it to become a medium of
[39:49] exchange but who knows this I always
[39:51] said it like this World War III is being
[39:54] fought right now and it started in the
[39:57] fincial realm and World War I is not USA
[40:00] versus China or Russia versus Ukraine or
[40:04] Iran versus Israel World War III is the
[40:07] money changers versus the people the the
[40:11] people that Jesus SED his he he he it
[40:13] was a righteous anger he sat down on the
[40:15] step and he for a couple hours he weaved
[40:18] together that whip cord he didn't it was
[40:20] not a a a leftist lip tarp reaction like
[40:23] ah he he took his time he wo that cord
[40:26] together and when he was done he took
[40:28] that court and he drove those money
[40:30] changers out of his father's house he
[40:32] drove those thieves out of the house and
[40:35] that's the war we fight right now we
[40:37] fight we the people are fighting against
[40:40] the money changers and they're going to
[40:41] do everything they can in order to
[40:44] maintain control and uh maintain the
[40:46] ability to raid the piggy bank via
[40:49] inflation so it's a big obstacle and in
[40:52] the long run I hope we get there I think
[40:54] Bitcoin is the Trojan Horse right bring
[40:56] it in this perfect pristine collateral
[40:59] borrow against it but somewhere some
[41:02] somewhere down the line Bitcoin without
[41:04] the human without remove right because
[41:07] Bitcoin removes the human element from
[41:08] monetary policy and it cages the human
[41:11] element with everything else but in the
[41:13] Fiat system you have an uncaged free to
[41:16] roam free to destroy human variable and
[41:18] at one point it will destroy and when it
[41:21] does Bitcoin will be there waiting for
[41:23] us as that perfect solution but until
[41:25] then we have to integrate it and we have
[41:27] to do it in a way where people are
[41:28] incentivized by profit because it's that
[41:30] profit that drives free market
[41:32] incentives and it's free market
[41:33] incentives that are going to actually
[41:35] produce results and bring change through
[41:37] we the people if you watch or listen to
[41:40] my podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[41:42] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[41:45] the most important step is to keep the
[41:48] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[41:50] wallet my personal recommendation for
[41:52] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[41:55] secure it's simple to set up it's also

[42:51] sovereign individual in general and last
[42:54] but not least I have something
[42:55] completely new for you guys I partnered
[42:59] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[43:02] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[43:05] saw created by anyone look at that
[43:08] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[43:11] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[43:14] perfect subtle elegant way to go out
[43:17] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[43:19] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[43:23] make sure to check out the link in the
[43:25] description for this amazing coin coin
[43:27] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[43:30] amazing I love them so much it was
[43:32] really hard for me to pick the one that
[43:34] I want to have because there are a lot
[43:36] of great options I went with the new
[43:38] transparency Edition they're all limited
[43:42] so grab yours those will not be
[43:44] available for a long time but there will
[43:46] come new models and new amazing designs
[43:49] along the way I love that a lot uh
[43:52] you're giving so great of and
[43:54] explanations like I don't have to ask a
[43:56] lot you you're giving the whole answer
[43:59] really nice um we had never the topic
[44:01] actually of borrowing against the
[44:03] Bitcoin it it comes up there here and
[44:05] there a little bit um but what do you
[44:09] recommend when it comes to borrowing
[44:11] against your Bitcoin other any um I
[44:15] would say I think financially you can
[44:17] always do the right strategy wrong like
[44:21] you you you can I I had um old friend of
[44:25] mine reached out and like oh I bought
[44:27] Bitcoin and then uh she was showing me
[44:29] and I was like you bought Bitcoin cash
[44:32] sorry so like uh like even she had the
[44:35] right thought she she learned about bit
[44:37] about Bitcoin just a little bit uh a
[44:40] little bit so she understands the power
[44:43] of Bitcoin but then not enough that she
[44:45] understands the difference between
[44:46] Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash um so so it's
[44:50] it's it's always like with whatever
[44:52] strategy you're doing you have to dive a
[44:54] little bit deep deeper to actually
[44:56] understand what you're doing uh what can
[44:58] you recommend for us when it comes to
[45:00] borrowing against your Bitcoin when does
[45:02] it make sense uh What uh best practices
[45:04] should we look out for when it gets
[45:06] dangerous should we get our keys away
[45:09] should like what are solutions yeah so
[45:13] the the number one thing when you're
[45:14] barring against your Bitcoin is that you
[45:16] have to understand that this Marketplace
[45:19] is very young right now and because it's
[45:22] so young most of the companies are
[45:24] coming with a Fiat mindset like at the
[45:27] Bitcoin conference that Trump spoke out
[45:29] uh I think right before him Cantor
[45:31] Fitzgerald made an announcement that
[45:33] they're getting into the Bitcoin lending
[45:35] space well the way it works right now is
[45:38] that you post your Bitcoin as
[45:40] collateral um with with the
[45:43] lender and and for some reason you know
[45:47] you have to borrow your Bitcoin for 12
[45:48] to
[45:49] 16% uh and most of the time that is is
[45:52] because that lender is working with a
[45:53] liquidity provider and that liquidity
[45:56] provider is char in them somewhere
[45:58] around the risk-free rate or the prime
[46:00] rate uh to borrow so you know you post
[46:03] your Bitcoin as collateral the the
[46:06] liquidity provider is lending that
[46:08] lender their money at say 6% and then
[46:11] they turn around tell you well you know
[46:14] we got I can't lend this money to you
[46:16] for less than six% because then I'm
[46:17] losing money but you know I'll lend it
[46:20] to you for 10% because I got to pay 6%
[46:23] to this guy for borrowing the money in
[46:24] the first place and then you know I get
[46:26] the 4 % afterwards as our profit our
[46:28] incentive to make the loan to you so the
[46:31] the market is so young and that the
[46:33] lenders and liquidity provisor providers
[46:36] have such a lack of understanding of
[46:38] what Bitcoin is as the most pristine
[46:40] form of collateral in the world that a
[46:42] lot of times it doesn't make sense to do
[46:43] that right now um just because of the
[46:46] added additional risk and then you have
[46:47] counterparty risk too so there's very
[46:49] few companies that are offering uh
[46:51] multi- signature uh collateral options
[46:54] where you post your collaterals held in
[46:55] multisig so that you know that Bitcoin
[46:58] is not being reh hypothecated right
[46:59] because that was that's what led to the
[47:01] collapse of the last bull market people
[47:03] were posting their Bitcoin borrowing
[47:04] against it and then the people that they
[47:06] were uh posting that Bitcoin to as
[47:08] collateral were reh hypothecating the
[47:10] Bitcoin and doing other things with it
[47:11] in the background if you borrow against
[47:13] your Bitcoin you need to to know that
[47:15] the person that you're posting that with
[47:17] as collateral is not going to reh
[47:19] hypothecate it or not take it and do
[47:21] other things with it it's not at risk of
[47:23] being lost or having another claim
[47:25] against it it only serves its purpose
[47:28] for the lending that you want to do and
[47:30] then the second thing that doesn't
[47:31] really make sense in that ads risk is
[47:33] the is the is the difference between the
[47:35] interest rate because you know this this
[47:37] baffles my mind and this is one of the
[47:39] reasons for that we're creating people's
[47:41] reserve a company who has a Bitcoin
[47:43] mindset and understands Bitcoin for what
[47:45] it truly is uh versus just a speculative
[47:48] asset and and that is this how can I go
[47:50] into a bank or a mortgage broker or
[47:53] provider and show them my my earned
[47:56] income and then make a promise to them
[47:58] like okay here you go you know I make
[48:00] $10,000 per month and my mortgage
[48:02] payment is going to be $3,000 per month
[48:05] and I promise you I'm gonna keep making
[48:07] money I'm gonna keep going to work I'm
[48:09] gonna keep making money and I promise
[48:10] you and hey look over the last six seven
[48:12] years I have a have a good credit score
[48:15] because I made promises to you and I've
[48:16] kept those promises but these are
[48:18] promises so when times are good promises
[48:21] are okay but when times go bad promises
[48:23] go to and you're able to go in and
[48:26] get a mortgage based on a promise for 6
[48:29] to 8% if you have a good credit score
[48:31] they'll give you around six if you have
[48:32] a bad credit score it'll be around eight
[48:34] if they even give you the money so
[48:38] that's based on promise and that's based
[48:40] on me having to continue to work and
[48:43] produce but you then you bring your
[48:45] Bitcoin you bring a million dollars of
[48:46] Bitcoin to the table and say oh I want
[48:48] to borrow $500,000 against this so
[48:50] there's literally zero risk there's no
[48:53] promise being made or what whatsoever
[48:55] you are you are borrowing less Equity
[48:57] value than what the collateral value
[48:59] that you're posting there's no risk to
[49:01] the lender and instead of instead of
[49:03] getting a six to eight% rate now I'm
[49:06] getting a 12 to 16% rate talk about
[49:09] getting double screwed right I'm posting
[49:12] I I made a promise with the Traditional
[49:14] Bank they gave me 6% I can break that
[49:16] promise and mess up the whole cycle I
[49:18] can't break the promise over on the
[49:20] Bitcoin side because if if I walk away
[49:22] from you if I break that promise and I
[49:24] walk away from you or for whatever
[49:26] reason you can just liquidate my
[49:28] collateral just sell the $500,000 of
[49:30] Bitcoin plus interest and then leave the
[49:32] rest there in my account for when I come
[49:34] back to get it and there's no risk to
[49:36] you there's no default risk at all well
[49:39] interest rates now this is the problem
[49:41] with interest rates we do not have free
[49:42] market interest rates when when the
[49:44] interest rate is stated by a group of
[49:47] men the free market is not determining
[49:49] that rate so in Bitcoin and and in
[49:52] decentralized finance or borrowing
[49:54] against your Bitcoin the rate is is
[49:57] based on the free market when the supply
[49:58] of money is high and the demand for
[50:00] money is low rates will fall when the
[50:02] supply of money is low and the demand is
[50:04] high rates will go up but there's also
[50:07] another element of interest rate which
[50:09] is the credit score which is risk so the
[50:12] the the the the interest rate should
[50:14] also be based on risk and when you have
[50:16] an over collateralized loan as a lender
[50:19] you're like foaming out the mouth like
[50:21] and that's what people's Reserve is
[50:23] people's Reserve are are smart
[50:25] bitcoiners coming together with their
[50:27] liquidity and saying hey uh you call US
[50:32] Government treasuries risk-free but I
[50:35] don't feel like they're risk-free and if
[50:37] I can loan to a if I can loan my money
[50:40] to a bitcoiner for 4% or 6% when the
[50:43] risk-free rate is 5% I'd much rather
[50:47] take a 100 basis point cut and have a
[50:50] risk-free loan a true risk-free loan
[50:53] covered by the collateral itself than
[50:55] lend money to the the government because
[50:57] the government yes there's no credit
[50:59] risk absolutely there's no credit risk
[51:01] to us treasuries because they can print
[51:03] the money and they can pay it to you you
[51:05] will get paid 100%
[51:08] guaranteed what you don't know is when
[51:10] you get paid what the hell are you going
[51:11] to be able to buy the next thing you
[51:13] don't know especially with what's going
[51:15] on in the United States right now I feel
[51:16] like a lot of people who don't live here
[51:18] like I'm in the United States fish tank
[51:20] you're in your fish tank the UK's in
[51:22] their fish tank you might have you might
[51:25] have vacationed there you might have
[51:26] seen nice things and but we don't know
[51:28] what it's like to live there and we
[51:29] don't know what the politics are like
[51:31] there but here in the United States it's
[51:33] almost just like covid I see families
[51:36] are dividing over this political
[51:39] discourse that's happening right now so
[51:41] that's you know that's what happened
[51:42] during the Civil War you had brothers
[51:43] fighting brothers and cousins fight
[51:45] fighting cousins over the political
[51:48] discourse and and we are devolving in my
[51:50] opinion that it's it's it's falling
[51:52] pretty fast right now and I'm not really
[51:54] sure what's going to happen after the
[51:55] election because
[51:57] in 2020 the Maga people said okay you
[52:00] know we're going to have a peaceful
[52:01] protest and we're going to fight this
[52:03] through the courts well in Georgia we
[52:06] found out in the courts there were
[52:08] 300,000 votes in Georgia that were cast
[52:11] illegally Biden won Georgia by 12,000
[52:14] votes so much more than 12,000 votes
[52:17] were cast for him out of those 300,000
[52:19] votes that were cast illegally therefore
[52:23] with that should have been a recount
[52:24] there should have been a recount there
[52:25] it was uh the results are skewed so a
[52:28] lot of people who are conservative and
[52:30] doesn't mean you have to support trump
[52:32] it just means that you want conservative
[52:33] values so people who are looking for
[52:35] conservative values we are naturally
[52:38] more conservative so we had a peaceful
[52:39] protest the Democrats won they won in
[52:42] 2020 they still went after the peaceful
[52:45] protesters even though they won instead
[52:47] of just saying ah hey nice try you know
[52:49] maybe you'll get us next time and then
[52:51] moving on no they went back and attacked
[52:54] the people who went for the peaceful
[52:55] protest you and I and everybody
[52:57] listening to this both know if real
[52:59] Patriots went to Washington DC on
[53:01] January 6th there would have been a lot
[53:03] more firing and it would have lasted
[53:05] more than one day those were peaceful
[53:07] protesters and they came and attacked
[53:09] them so what happens if Trump wins this
[53:12] time what happens if it's too big to rig
[53:16] uh and and you know they'd have to steal
[53:18] enough votes where there were more more
[53:19] votes were cast in eligible voters in
[53:21] order to steal it well if they attacked
[53:23] us after they won I don't want to know
[53:25] what they're going to do after they lose
[53:27] and then vice versa if they win again if
[53:30] they if if it's if it's uh you know RFK
[53:33] stays in the race and and draw some
[53:35] votes from the conservative side uh and
[53:37] somehow they have enough to to steal or
[53:40] even win uh then what are the magot
[53:42] people going to do are we gonna are we
[53:44] going to be conservative this time and
[53:46] try to fight it through the courts again
[53:47] or are we going to be a little bit more
[53:49] aggressive I don't know the answer to
[53:50] that question but in my mind as a money
[53:53] manager what I'm saying is that's risk
[53:56] so so I have the inflation risk there no
[53:58] credit risk great but I have inflation
[54:00] risk I have Civil War risk and you know
[54:02] the last time we went into Civil War uh
[54:05] there was a uh the Montgomery issuance
[54:08] the southern states the Confederacy they
[54:10] could not bank with their enemies so
[54:13] they had to create their own system they
[54:14] created Confederate debt notes
[54:17] Confederate Currency and it ended up
[54:19] being worthless because they they lost
[54:21] the war but there was an economic divide
[54:23] there was an economic split and it came
[54:25] back to
[54:26] the issuance of treasury debt so if
[54:28] there's an economic divide if the people
[54:30] in Florida and Texas and the Bible Belt
[54:33] don't want to pay to give all these
[54:36] illegal immigrants who are going to New
[54:38] York to get
[54:39] $220,000 uh for just showing up you get
[54:41] a Walmart card or or a cash debit card
[54:44] with $20,000 on it they're getting food
[54:46] stamps they're getting all they're
[54:47] taking advantage of all the programs
[54:49] that are designed to help American
[54:51] citizens uh and they're doing it in a
[54:53] way that is illegal it's perfectly okay
[54:56] to do that in a way that's legal that's
[54:58] why the system is set up to help you
[54:59] it's there to provide legal help for you
[55:02] to to get those things to help you get
[55:04] ahead in life but when you illegally
[55:05] take advantage of it it creates a
[55:07] problem for everybody and now they're
[55:09] taking what if we don't want to pay for
[55:11] that anymore what if what if the north
[55:13] doesn't want to pay for a program that
[55:14] we come up with who's in who's in
[55:16] control of the treasury what happens if
[55:18] there is a division who gets the right
[55:20] to print the money who's in charge of
[55:22] rolling over the debt who's in charge of
[55:24] of of of all of this stuff stuff it's
[55:27] it's a very big risk to lend your money
[55:30] to the government right now especially
[55:31] the US government and the whole world
[55:33] doesn't see it that way but there's a
[55:34] lot of people who do see it that way and
[55:36] we' rather lend our money to bitcoiners
[55:39] that have that take out loans against
[55:41] their Bitcoin in an over collateralized
[55:43] fashion where we have no default risk
[55:45] zero default risk and we we see that as
[55:48] a much uh less risk than lending to the
[55:52] government and I think this this idea
[55:54] and this understanding we know that
[55:56] other countries are already selling out
[55:59] of treasuries because they see that same
[56:00] risk we see bricks organizing against
[56:03] that movement to kind of transfer that
[56:05] risk to themselves versus the United
[56:07] States and with all of that taking place
[56:10] you know it comes back to what do the
[56:13] lenders want to do because a lot of
[56:14] people want to borrow that's that's you
[56:16] know people could get get this confused
[56:18] when you go to the bank and you want to
[56:20] borrow the bank can say no the power of
[56:22] the credit Market is in the lender not
[56:25] the borrower right so what do lenders
[56:27] want to lend into and and for us and for
[56:30] people who understand Bitcoin I think
[56:32] it's very just common sense when you
[56:35] look at nominal Returns versus real
[56:37] returns that you want to be lending to
[56:39] people who are borrowing against their
[56:41] bitcoiners it's not going to be nation
[56:43] states who are the risk-free borrowers
[56:46] in the future in the very near future
[56:48] it's going to be bitcoiners who are the
[56:50] risk-free borrowers and who set the
[56:52] risk-free rate within the marketplace
[56:54] and that's about that's what people's
[56:56] Reserve is all about leveraging that
[56:58] understanding to empower both lender and
[57:01] borrower I love that um because you
[57:04] mentioned Trump uh I think one thing
[57:06] that uh I want to do because like for me
[57:09] I'm in Austra so like for me the
[57:11] election is is nice to watch but I
[57:13] cannot do anything anyway so I will on
[57:16] the election day when they are counting
[57:17] it I will stay up late so I can see it
[57:20] because it will be very late on my side
[57:21] it will be probably like 2 in the
[57:22] morning or something like that um but I
[57:25] always love that I did it last last two
[57:27] times also like eight years ago uh and
[57:30] four years ago um but is Trump and or
[57:35] RFK depending on on what you're voting
[57:38] for is are those two the the obvious
[57:40] choices for for bitcoiners if you plan
[57:42] out all the other things that you might
[57:44] want to consider in elections you might
[57:46] not want to be a single isue voter I
[57:49] would be I will be uh in we have in
[57:52] September also elections in in Austria
[57:54] uh unfortunately Bitcoin is not a topic
[57:56] here so I have to find other things that
[57:58] are closer to bitcoin but do you think
[58:00] that that Trump is is the obvious choice
[58:02] for bitcoiners I think Trump is probably
[58:05] the best choice for bitcoiners and I
[58:08] think that's because um
[58:11] RFK you know they they both deal in a
[58:13] little bit of coinery which I don't
[58:15] like so I don't think either of them is
[58:17] really the the perfect candidate but you
[58:19] know in what world are we going to get
[58:21] the perfect candidate it's just not
[58:23] going to exist so it it it is definitely
[58:26] a hard choice I think like you said
[58:28] earlier people kind of they were so
[58:30] blown away by what RFK said during the
[58:32] conference that what Trump said was kind
[58:34] of belittled uh because of of the way he
[58:37] had to make his statements but I do
[58:39] think that both Trump and RFK have taken
[58:43] at least a couple orange pills uh and
[58:46] and can see which way it's going but I
[58:47] also think that Trump has more support
[58:50] than RFK so God forbid Trump was
[58:54] actually assassinated not that long ago
[58:57] and now we're looking at you know who
[58:58] can it be then who you know nobody can
[59:01] replace Trump uh but RFK would be the
[59:04] go-to guy and I was kind of hoping that
[59:06] Trump would like bring RFK in on on his
[59:10] team like maybe you don't want to be
[59:12] vice president maybe you want to be the
[59:14] head of the Department of Homeland
[59:15] safety or or health and and whatever you
[59:19] know like RFK is really good on vaccines
[59:21] so let's get him going out and fighting
[59:23] these people and and making sure the
[59:25] right regulations are are being created
[59:27] and the right safety Protocols are being
[59:29] set up so that we can have safe vaccines
[59:32] because it's not like there's no such
[59:33] thing as safe vaccines there are but
[59:35] because of the deregulation because of
[59:36] the corruption of Fiat money these
[59:38] vaccines are actually more dangerous
[59:40] than they are helpful but when vaccines
[59:42] first came out they were more helpful
[59:43] than they were dangerous so what
[59:45] happened uh science is is corrupted by
[59:48] the Fiat money printing machine and and
[59:51] corrupted by uh greed so RFK would be
[59:55] the perfect guy to get in there to help
[59:57] fight that but he doesn't have the same
[59:59] base as Donald Trump that's the problem
[60:02] Trump has that conservative base he has
[60:04] the the make America great again base
[60:06] and that is what's easiest to build
[60:09] around it's easiest to build around make
[60:12] this country great again I think more
[60:14] people from both sides both feel that
[60:17] something's wrong in the country it's
[60:18] trending the wrong way and it's it's
[60:20] actually in the whole world the whole
[60:22] world is trending the wrong way and we
[60:24] need somebody to help make it great
[60:26] again just get back to these Common
[60:28] Sense policies instead of modern
[60:31] monetary Theory instead of open borders
[60:34] instead of a two-tiered legal system
[60:37] let's just go back to like fair game
[60:39] fair rules it reminds me of Monopoly
[60:41] right when you play Monopoly with your
[60:43] friends or family the game's really fun
[60:45] in the beginning but after the game
[60:48] after it's like established it starts to
[60:49] get bored you start to throw money in
[60:50] free parking you start to come up with
[60:52] different rules to make it fun and
[60:54] that's where we are in real life the
[60:56] game has become so ex overextended that
[61:00] now all these crazy rule changes and
[61:02] everything's are and then this case it's
[61:04] detrimental it's detrimental to society
[61:06] it's detrimental to culture uh no
[61:09] borders in Europe no borders in the
[61:11] United States no borders in the UK
[61:13] everything's falling apart there's no
[61:15] there's I've seen a videos of people
[61:18] getting pulled out of their home from
[61:20] the UK police for retweeting a tweet and
[61:23] then meanwhile there's a group of 10 15
[61:26] illegal immigrants walking around with
[61:27] baseball bats smashing random car
[61:30] windows closing businesses down and
[61:32] there's not a police in sight so let's
[61:34] get back to to having good police why
[61:36] aren't police paid better why aren't
[61:38] firefighters paid better and ambulances
[61:40] paid better why why aren't teachers paid
[61:43] better these are all common sense things
[61:45] that most people agree on that you know
[61:48] where where we should focus our spending
[61:50] and where we should focus on how to fix
[61:52] this problem is to make us great again
[61:54] to get rid of America make Humanity
[61:56] great again humanity is falling off the
[61:58] edge of the cliff we need to make it
[62:00] great again and that's a really good
[62:02] message to unify around that most people
[62:04] agree with I wish that they would unify
[62:07] around truth money because I don't think
[62:09] we should unify if you're going to unify
[62:11] around one man it has to be Jesus Christ
[62:14] because you cannot unify around man and
[62:17] and have success so if you're going to
[62:19] unify it should be around an idea and
[62:21] that idea is economic freedom economic
[62:25] Liberty and that's found in truth money
[62:27] and that's Bitcoin so in my opinion
[62:29] that's the best way to move forward and
[62:32] when you look at Trump and you look at
[62:33] RFK neither of them are working on that
[62:35] platform RFK speaks very well about
[62:38] Bitcoin but it's not his main driver
[62:41] Trump says what makes people happy about
[62:43] Bitcoin but it's not his main driver I
[62:46] think eventually over time what we're
[62:48] going to see as Bitcoin continues to uh
[62:50] make its way into the political space
[62:52] and political realm you're going to see
[62:54] much more competent polic politicians
[62:56] who became bitcoiners and like like the
[62:59] saying goes you don't change Bitcoin
[63:00] Bitcoin changes you right just takes
[63:02] some time so we need these politicians
[63:04] to adopt Bitcoin and then we need them
[63:06] to spend some time with it so that
[63:08] Bitcoin can change them so that we can
[63:10] start to change the focus to to a more
[63:13] economic Focus rather than a virtue
[63:15] signaling focus and and neither
[63:18] candidate does that so it's a tough
[63:20] question because you have to pick
[63:22] somebody uh you can't not pick anybody
[63:24] or else now it's too big to rig again
[63:26] they're just going to steal it so I you
[63:28] know me personally I'll be voting for
[63:30] Trump and I hope that RFK drops out and
[63:34] endorses Trump but I hope that is not
[63:36] because he's forced to do that I hope
[63:38] that's because Trump opens the door and
[63:40] and and gives him a highlevel position
[63:42] that he wants and said look Bobby what
[63:45] do you want what do you want to do drop
[63:47] out support me I will put you in
[63:49] whatever spot you want to be in and then
[63:51] I'd expect RFK to be like that's not
[63:53] good enough I got about 50 people I want
[63:55] to bring with me if you want me to get
[63:56] this job done right and Trump should say
[63:58] you got it you get whatever spot you
[64:00] want and you get to name 50 other people
[64:02] where they need to be to help you get
[64:03] this job done guaranteed and now we can
[64:06] start to move forward now now we can get
[64:08] you know why do I have to choose between
[64:09] the both of them let's team up let's
[64:11] let's get together understanding that
[64:14] you have some good things with make
[64:15] America great again I have some good
[64:17] things with some common sense fixes
[64:19] let's work together to make it better
[64:21] again and we're not and we're just not
[64:23] seeing that so I I love both of them but
[64:25] I'll be voting for Trump and I hope that
[64:27] Trump is able to get RFK to drop out and
[64:30] endorse him so that he can play a big
[64:32] role in helping Trump drain the swap
[64:34] something he failed to do last time
[64:36] while spending quite a bit of money uh
[64:38] we need to we need to change it we need
[64:40] to change it we need to change it fast
[64:42] or else we're at risk of trust being
[64:45] lost and if trust is lost before we
[64:47] figure out putting Bitcoin on the
[64:49] balance sheet then at that point there's
[64:52] no there's no way to get back to it I
[64:54] think even if trust is lost you move
[64:56] from inflation to hyperinflation even if
[64:57] you add Bitcoin to the balance sheet too
[64:59] late it's like one of those things like
[65:00] once it happen I'm shot you can't get
[65:02] unshot it's done once it happens you
[65:04] need to react uh and unfortunately um we
[65:08] we might see that but I'm hoping and
[65:10] praying that we don't and I'll be
[65:11] casting my vote for Trump and I I you
[65:14] know I see um I gotta bring this up
[65:16] because Dennis Porter who is a great
[65:19] Advocate and he's the head of Satoshi
[65:20] action fund and everybody should be
[65:23] behind them and should support them but
[65:25] you know he came out he said that you
[65:26] know he he was joking around but he just
[65:28] like as the last uh non-political
[65:31] Bitcoin spokesperson you know the
[65:33] problem with that position of being
[65:36] apolitical and not taking a side is that
[65:38] one side is trying to use the law
[65:40] against you so you you can't just ignore
[65:43] that you have to actually use the law to
[65:45] protect yourself and I and I and I point
[65:48] back to the Constitution you know the
[65:50] founding fathers didn't use the law to
[65:53] start a war with Great Britain they use
[65:56] the law to protect humans god-given
[65:58] rights that that was the point we want
[66:00] to be independent and we want to be
[66:02] governed by ourselves and then once they
[66:03] were now we're going to use the law to
[66:06] protect god-given rights to protect
[66:08] people from government not to protect
[66:10] the USA from Great Britain or France and
[66:12] we need to get more of that ideology in
[66:14] politics and that that ideology is
[66:16] really that's the Bitcoin mindset the
[66:18] Bitcoin mindset is about protecting your
[66:20] fellow men through monetary law you
[66:23] can't let any someone steal from you you
[66:25] can't let
[66:26] uh dilute the value of your labor you
[66:29] can protect your time and savings
[66:31] through space based on the value that
[66:32] you deliver to others and they can have
[66:34] their value protected because we have
[66:36] the correct monetary laws and those are
[66:39] the uh found in Bitcoin and nowhere else
[66:41] so what a time to be alive to see all of
[66:44] this kind of coming together all at the
[66:46] same time it's definitely going to be an
[66:48] interesting six months absolutely i i f
[66:51] fully agree with that and it's also
[66:53] interesting for me um because I was very
[66:56] political uh before Bitcoin Bitcoin kind
[66:59] of made me a little bit more apolitical
[67:03] but now I'm getting a little bit more
[67:06] back in because I realized that first I
[67:10] realized that um Bitcoin Bitcoin itself
[67:14] doesn't care about politics but you as a
[67:17] bitcoiner should care about politics
[67:19] because the jurisdiction you live in
[67:21] they can make laws and they can make
[67:23] your living hell that's right so so uh
[67:27] either you have to fight the politics in
[67:29] your country or you uh have to leave the
[67:32] country and and go somewhere where it's
[67:34] it's better for you but making a blind
[67:37] eye to Politics as a
[67:39] bitcoiner um is just it's just not the
[67:43] right move like you have to open your
[67:44] eyes and you have to see okay what what
[67:47] things are going on in my political
[67:50] jurisdiction uh what's going on uh I
[67:52] mean in in Austria is easy because you
[67:55] have to see Austra and you have to to
[67:57] see the European Union in America like
[67:59] your state and what what's going on a
[68:01] federal level but it's it it I think it
[68:05] would be ignorant to say like oh I'm
[68:08] apolitical I don't care what politics do
[68:09] because I have Bitcoin yeah but you have
[68:11] a physical body and they have physical
[68:14] guns and they can make you do things so
[68:17] I think it's important to to vot and
[68:20] influence that system well Bitcoin
[68:22] Bitcoin shows no bias right that's what
[68:25] we love about it it shows no bias
[68:27] Bitcoin is for everyone it's monetary
[68:30] law that protects everyone but because
[68:33] Bitcoin shows no bias we as people must
[68:37] show bias that's the tradeoff now if you
[68:40] don't want that you actually want
[68:43] political fiat currency units because
[68:45] political fiat currency units show bias
[68:48] right if you're Russia you got your
[68:51] reserves taken from you and you even had
[68:53] your reserves taken from you and given
[68:55] to your enemy the dollar shows bias so
[68:58] that we won't have to so you don't want
[69:00] to give up your right to show bias you
[69:03] should have a right to be biased and the
[69:05] money should not have a right to be
[69:07] biased so that's what's so great about
[69:09] Bitcoin Bitcoin shows no bias is for
[69:11] everyone but that means that we have to
[69:14] be more responsible as a people and we
[69:17] have to show bias we can't let the next
[69:20] Adolf Hitler or ma get into office
[69:24] because we don't want to show bias
[69:25] because because Bitcoin doesn't show
[69:27] bias and Bitcoin is for everyone yeah
[69:29] Bitcoin is for everyone but you know
[69:31] what I don't want my enemies to have
[69:33] Bitcoin I don't want people who are
[69:36] trying to attack my children to have
[69:38] Bitcoin I don't want people who want the
[69:40] government to be able to tell me that I
[69:42] have to stay in my home and take a
[69:44] vaccine to work to buy Bitcoin so yeah
[69:47] Bitcoin shows no bias Bitcoin is for
[69:49] everyone but that means now humans have
[69:52] the added responsibility of being biased
[69:55] and being proactive to make sure that
[69:57] that money gets into the right hands
[69:59] through the power of ideas and value
[70:02] acrel versus just printer go Burr and
[70:05] everybody gets their Universal basic
[70:07] income and let us the government show
[70:09] the bias for you so that you don't have
[70:10] to worry about it horrible trade-off
[70:12] horrible trade-off Bitcoin shows no bias
[70:15] so that we can show bias and if you
[70:18] don't like that well then stick with
[70:19] your Fiat political currency units
[70:21] because then you don't get to choose
[70:22] what to be biased against and the and
[70:24] the the currency itself controlled by
[70:26] the government will choose where to show
[70:28] bias and one day that bias is going to
[70:30] show up on your doorstep and you're not
[70:32] going to be able to to have any freedom
[70:34] to spend that money the way you want to
[70:36] because it's a it's a central bank
[70:38] digital currency it expired or
[70:40] somebody's already bought enough bacon
[70:41] this month so you're not eligible to buy
[70:43] I mean that's where we're going if you
[70:45] want if you want to show bias in
[70:47] currency where're you can adopt the
[70:49] Central Bank digital currency if you
[70:50] want your money to be every for everyone
[70:53] then has to be Bitcoin but but you have
[70:55] to take the added step of added
[70:58] responsibility to show bias and to
[71:01] communicate why ideas are good and bad
[71:04] and to allow the free market to
[71:06] understand those ideas and then act on
[71:08] those incentives two kind of
[71:10] CounterPoint systems which is amazing to
[71:12] to think about especially when we just
[71:14] talked about how one could support the
[71:16] other based on where we are in in the
[71:18] Dynamics of the
[71:19] marketplace I love that a lot really
[71:21] cool um as the time is already very
[71:23] progressed I want to bring in one more
[71:25] topic because we also discussed it in
[71:27] the beginning uh Bitcoin bonds and what
[71:30] they can do for Nations uh for America
[71:33] but for for every nation I mean we have
[71:34] already with El Salvador an example um
[71:37] what can they do if like America
[71:40] actually goes ahead and has a Bitcoin
[71:42] Bond uh and second to that what will
[71:46] that unlock as a new frontier for
[71:50] Bitcoin I mean the ETF was a major
[71:52] Financial instrument but what would
[71:55] Bitcoin bonds do for for the Bitcoin
[71:57] price action yeah so this
[72:00] is I've dedicated the last three years
[72:02] of my life to this product and we've
[72:05] been building in stealth and we're going
[72:06] to go live first quarter of next year so
[72:08] I'm really excited to finally really be
[72:10] able to be talking about it and what's
[72:13] so important about Bitcoin bonds is the
[72:15] the first thing that I hear back when I
[72:16] talk to a lot of big people they go
[72:18] listen son we're lenders we're not
[72:21] investors we're not going to invest in
[72:23] Bitcoin number one because they Charter
[72:25] doesn't let them uh or number two
[72:27] regulation doesn't let them uh and we
[72:29] actually we just heard Michael sailor
[72:31] talk about that the other day he came on
[72:33] and said that um you know what problem
[72:35] are you solving the problem is that a
[72:37] Chinese businessman can't buy Bitcoin
[72:39] directly can't buy the ETFs but he can
[72:42] buy debt that's issued by micro strategy
[72:45] right so he can he can lend his money to
[72:47] micro strategy and get exposure to
[72:49] bitcoin and that's what this is all
[72:50] about it's about reaching a whole new
[72:53] Marketplace not just investors but
[72:55] lenders and there's a lot of lenders in
[72:57] the market like a money market fund
[72:59] money market funds can't invest they
[73:01] have to lend okay so the the the market
[73:03] for Lending is a really big Marketplace
[73:05] a lot of people just think that you know
[73:07] the quadrillion worth of wealth in the
[73:09] world is all investing or they confuse
[73:12] investing with lending and and the
[73:13] different types of Regulation around
[73:15] both of those strategies but it's very
[73:17] different and and salor laid that out
[73:19] perfectly so what Bitcoin bonds are
[73:21] structured for not necessarily investors
[73:23] for lenders and it's a two-part thing
[73:26] because um you see a program like Social
[73:29] Security in the United States they have
[73:31] to keep raising the full retirement age
[73:34] uh and they have to keep lowering the
[73:36] value of the benefit in real terms right
[73:38] so although the the amount of money
[73:40] you're receiving goes up the cost of
[73:42] living goes up faster so the quality of
[73:44] life and standard of living provided for
[73:47] through Social Security continues to
[73:49] crash so we have a really big problem
[73:51] and that is that social security has
[73:53] like 10 years left before
[73:55] uh it has to start picking out of the
[73:56] piggy bank and and it's going to be
[73:58] dunzo it'll end very quickly from that
[74:00] point it'll accelerate uh into into
[74:02] nothing and Bitcoin Bon enters the scene
[74:06] as a solution for lenders because what
[74:09] happens is it creates a positive
[74:11] feedback loop and this is where it plays
[74:13] into the price of Bitcoin because when
[74:15] you have uh more demand it it creates uh
[74:20] more issuances and then when you have
[74:21] more issuances it creates more Demand on
[74:24] spot Bitcoin you have more Demand on
[74:26] spot Bitcoin it pushes up the price of
[74:27] Bitcoin which then increases the yield
[74:30] of the note itself and I'll get into
[74:32] that in a second and then when the yield
[74:34] increases on the note it creates more
[74:35] demand so when you have more demand you
[74:37] have more issuances it creates a
[74:38] positive feedback loop so you can your
[74:41] listeners can kind of picture that
[74:42] positive feedback loop in their in their
[74:44] mind there's more demand because you
[74:46] have higher yield and then because
[74:48] there's higher higher yield you have
[74:49] more issuances more Demand on spot
[74:51] bitcoin price goes up more demand for
[74:53] issuances and so on okay well here's how
[74:56] it would work let's say the United
[74:58] States um has has the first thing you
[75:01] have to do is you have to get Bitcoin
[75:02] and this is where the global hash War
[75:04] comes into play Putin just uh making uh
[75:07] cryptocurrency and Bitcoin mining legal
[75:08] in Russia countries trying to get their
[75:10] hands on bitcoin and and they can get
[75:13] their hands on bitcoin to create a
[75:15] stockpile and Reserve to help their
[75:16] assets out of the balance sheet like we
[75:17] talked about but what about the times
[75:19] that they need to sell that Bitcoin if
[75:21] they need to sell that Bitcoin or if
[75:22] they can sell that Bitcoin in a way that
[75:24] benefits
[75:25] other portions of the balance sheet and
[75:27] that's what the Bitcoin Bond really
[75:29] helps companies do so in this case I'd
[75:31] like to do the Social Security example
[75:33] where the US government would be the
[75:35] issuer so the US government would issue
[75:38] the Bitcoin Bond let's say it's a
[75:39] billion dollar Bond just for math sake
[75:41] that's like pennies to them but just so
[75:43] people can follow along the example
[75:45] easily how it works is they issued the
[75:47] billion dollar Bond and let's say that
[75:49] you know Trump gets in and actually
[75:51] starts collecting tariffs in Bitcoin
[75:53] right so we come we become that lowcost
[75:55] energy producer we start becoming a
[75:57] Bitcoin mining Powerhouse maybe the
[75:59] country itself starts mining some
[76:01] Bitcoin we're collecting Bitcoin through
[76:03] tariffs and now we're starting to build
[76:05] up our Bitcoin well what do we want to
[76:07] do we want to recapitalize The Republic
[76:10] we want to make Social Security great
[76:12] again how do we do that well we have to
[76:14] make the asset side of the Social
[76:16] Security fund grow faster than the
[76:17] liability side isn't it funny how all
[76:19] these Concepts come back and merge on
[76:21] the on the balance sheet the Social
[76:23] Security fund it just holds government
[76:26] debt it holds government notes and it
[76:28] holds government bonds and the problem
[76:30] is is that those notes and bonds are
[76:32] negative yielding in real terms because
[76:34] the rate of inflation is higher than the
[76:37] rate of return and the effective
[76:39] interest rate of the Social Security
[76:41] funds in 2023 was
[76:43] 2.4% so even right now if you believe
[76:46] the government's 3% CPI it's still
[76:49] negative carry and if you use gfl.com
[76:52] CPI that which uses the 1982 CPI before
[76:55] they did substitution we're we're at 10%
[76:58] so the negative carry is upwards of Nega
[77:00] -7% which is significant negative carry
[77:03] but this is why they have to keep
[77:04] raising the full retirement age and
[77:06] decreasing the the payouts in real terms
[77:09] they keep buying you less and less and
[77:10] less over time so how do we fix this
[77:13] again we need the asset side of the
[77:14] balance sheet to outperform the
[77:16] liability side unfortunately that's
[77:18] that's exactly what a Ponzi scheme
[77:21] really is and that's why the you know
[77:23] the problem is we have now is we have
[77:24] more people collecting Social Security
[77:26] than paying into it so the liabilities
[77:28] grow faster than the assets how do we
[77:30] fix this not with negative yielding
[77:33] government debt so they issu the Bitcoin
[77:35] Bond it's a billion dollar raise when
[77:37] they rais the billion dollars from the
[77:40] way they would do it is they take the
[77:41] Social Security tax now you're not
[77:44] selling the bond to the marketplace
[77:45] you're selling the bond to the Social
[77:47] Security fund because the idea is you
[77:49] want to recapitalize the fund itself um
[77:52] so at first you you make that a private
[77:54] issue isance from the from the treasury
[77:56] to the Social Security fund the Social
[77:58] Security tax income is what's invested
[78:01] into the bond the Bitcoin Bond and they
[78:03] invest a billion dollars well 80% of
[78:06] that money or $800
[78:08] million will go into a US Treasury
[78:11] because the US government is the issuer
[78:13] of the Bitcoin Bond right it's it's very
[78:15] exciting because at people's Reserve
[78:17] we're talking to a few different
[78:18] sovereigns one of the
[78:20] sovereigns uh has about 30 billion
[78:24] barrels of oil oil off of their Shore so
[78:27] when they issued a Bitcoin Bond they
[78:29] would be issuing it from their
[78:31] nationalized oil company so the bond
[78:33] would be backed by the oil in the ground
[78:35] that the country owns in the in this
[78:38] case scenario the bond is backed by the
[78:40] printer of the United States so
[78:42] depending upon who issues the Bitcoin
[78:43] Bond the principal protected note
[78:46] portion of the bond differs right so
[78:49] most people would say oh if the US
[78:50] government issues the bond then it's
[78:52] risk it's a risk-free principal
[78:54] protection and that's fine you can you
[78:56] can say that and then uh if there's a
[78:58] country that issues a Bitcoin bond with
[79:00] say3 trillion dollar of oil in the
[79:02] ground well that's pretty good principal
[79:04] protection too right goes back to like
[79:06] do you want to loan to the government
[79:07] with the printer or do you want to loan
[79:09] to that bitcoiner who's posting Bitcoin
[79:10] collateral well do you want to loan to
[79:12] the government with a printer or do you
[79:13] want to loan to the government with3
[79:15] trillion dollar of oil in the ground or
[79:17] do you want to do both I think both are
[79:19] are pretty much okay with where we are
[79:20] right now and uh I prefer the oil though
[79:23] personally because of the the real world
[79:25] asset backing that principal protection
[79:27] versus just the government's printer so
[79:29] at the end of The Five-Year note what
[79:31] happens is that $800
[79:33] million it matures at a value of one
[79:36] billion and this is really important
[79:38] from the lender side because when you're
[79:40] lending into the bond itself the Social
[79:42] Security fund cannot have nominal
[79:45] negative returns right if let's say the
[79:46] Social Security fund just bought a
[79:48] billion dollars worth of bitcoin well
[79:50] what happens when they need to sell that
[79:52] Bitcoin at a time in order to pay some
[79:55] of the uh the uh you know that to pay to
[79:59] the the people contribute and they
[80:01] receive so when you have to pay to the
[80:02] receivers you have to sell some of your
[80:04] Bitcoin but let's just say they Ed the
[80:06] cycle bad and in that cycle Bitcoin is
[80:08] you know that billion dollars is only
[80:10] worth $800 million and they're down
[80:12] they're Negative they can't take nominal
[80:14] negative risk that's what the principal
[80:16] protected note does for Bitcoin and it
[80:18] and it's really not a Bitcoin Bond like
[80:20] you would think like El Salvador and Max
[80:22] Kaiser and Samson because they're
[80:23] collecting Bitcoin and then paying yield
[80:25] in Bitcoin we flip the script to take
[80:27] advantage of the marketplace which is
[80:29] the dollar denominated return on bitcoin
[80:31] the 60% kager on bitcoin becoming the
[80:33] yield of the note because you bought the
[80:35] billion dollars the 800 million went
[80:39] into the government debt 200 million
[80:41] goes directly into spot
[80:43] Bitcoin at the end of the five years the
[80:46] 800 million matures at a value of 1
[80:49] billion so you have principal protection
[80:51] you cannot lose that's really important
[80:52] you cannot lose what what do you gain
[80:55] well what's left over is the performance
[80:57] of the $200 million of Bitcoin now
[81:00] what's really interesting is if Bitcoin
[81:03] goes to zero which you and I both know
[81:05] it's not going to but even if it did you
[81:07] don't lose okay but what if Bitcoin goes
[81:09] down 50% in five years well that's
[81:11] unprecedented but let's just say it did
[81:13] a lot of these people think that that
[81:14] could happen well that 200 million turns
[81:18] into 100 million so the note matures at
[81:21] a value of 1.1 billion well 100 million
[81:25] divided by a billion is is basically 10%
[81:27] right and 10% divided by five years in
[81:30] simple interest terms is 2% per year so
[81:33] if you issue a Bitcoin Bond remember the
[81:35] effective rate of the Social Security
[81:36] fund in 2023 was
[81:38] 2.3% so if you issue a Bitcoin Bond and
[81:41] in five years the price of Bitcoin goes
[81:43] down 50% which it wouldn't because
[81:45] remember the positive feedback loop
[81:47] higher yields more demand more demand
[81:49] more issuances more issuances more
[81:51] Demand on spot Bitcoin more Demand on
[81:53] spot Bitcoin higher bitcoin price higher
[81:54] bitcoin price higher yields the positive
[81:56] feedback loop gets rid of that scenario
[81:59] but if it even if it did go negative 50%
[82:01] you're at 2% apy and if the price stayed
[82:04] flat at 200 million you're at you're at
[82:07] 4% apy so if you issue a Bitcoin Bond
[82:10] and the price of Bitcoin stays the same
[82:12] over five years you are almost
[82:14] performing at 100% the rate of the
[82:17] existing effective rate of the Social
[82:19] Security fund now what if Bitcoin really
[82:22] does what it's supposed to do and this
[82:23] is what's so exciting about AIT Bitcoin
[82:24] Bond it's the it's the price performance
[82:26] of Bitcoin that creates the yield on the
[82:29] bond so you have the best performing
[82:31] asset in the world now creating the
[82:33] yield on the bond so we have the lowest
[82:35] risk highest reward cash flow vehicle
[82:38] that the marketplace has ever seen
[82:40] because Bitcoin is the best performing
[82:42] asset that the marketplace has ever seen
[82:44] and we're and we leverage that in this
[82:46] product and now if Bitcoin goes let's
[82:48] say Bitcoin sticks to its 60% kager over
[82:51] that 5-year period the price of Bitcoin
[82:53] will go up 10x in 5 years so the price
[82:56] of Bitcoin right now would be trading
[82:57] around
[82:58] 600,000 very realistic because that's
[83:00] about half the market cap of gold by the
[83:02] way a lot of people say oh Bitcoin can't
[83:04] go to a million are you kidding me it
[83:06] during covid Bitcoin went from 3,000 to
[83:09] 60,000 that's 20x based off of lowering
[83:12] interest rates and quantitative easing
[83:14] we're about to go into that right now
[83:16] we're about to lower interest rates it's
[83:17] about to be uh discovered that the fed's
[83:20] demand destruction campaign was
[83:21] successful we're going to need to do
[83:23] more deficit spending to to fix the
[83:26] economy that they destroyed and on those
[83:29] same things Bitcoin if it just holds
[83:31] 50,000 through this Yi curve un
[83:33] inversion and through this process that
[83:35] same move from 3,000 to 60,000 is the
[83:37] same measured move it's a 20x from
[83:39] 50,000 to a million and Bitcoin at 1
[83:42] million is basically the market cap of
[83:44] gold which is still a relatively small
[83:46] market cap uh compared to all the other
[83:49] assets in the world so that is very
[83:50] realistic but in this case scenario
[83:52] let's just say it sticks with its 60%
[83:53] kager we're at 600,000 well that Bitcoin
[83:56] is now matured at 10x from 200 million
[84:00] to 2 billion so you you you lent a
[84:03] billion the Bitcoin turned into two
[84:05] billion you get the billion back through
[84:07] the government debt that's $3 billion do
[84:10] upon maturation that's 200% over the
[84:12] course of five years that's 40% apy 40
[84:17] that's better than credit cards and
[84:18] credit cards are junk debt credit cards
[84:20] are high-risk debt that many times gets
[84:23] default on and get sold for pennies on
[84:25] the dollar and you're talking around 20
[84:27] to 30% Bitcoin could realistically based
[84:30] on its previous past performance without
[84:33] even accounting for the the positive
[84:35] feedback loop of this process could
[84:37] produce 40% apy that is how you save
[84:41] Social Security that is how you
[84:43] recapitalize the Republic and make
[84:45] Social Security great again that is how
[84:46] you take any government program in any
[84:48] country that is failing and you
[84:51] recapitalize it with Bitcoin bonds so
[84:54] this we couldn't be more excited about
[84:56] the opportunity for governments States
[85:00] cities municipalities and even private
[85:03] corporations to issue Bitcoin Bonds in
[85:06] order to attract lenders because that's
[85:08] the future we're heading into people are
[85:09] not going to be okay lending at a
[85:11] negative rate a a very big negative rate
[85:15] the rates thus far have not been too
[85:17] negative but we're heading into a new
[85:19] era of all-time high inflation and when
[85:22] we get there it's not going to be
[85:24] subtracting the 10% inflation from the
[85:26] from the 5% it's going to be subtracting
[85:29] 15 and 20% inflation from the
[85:32] 0.1% or the one or two% you get on
[85:35] long-term government debt we're talking
[85:36] about negative returns in the teens so
[85:40] that over the course of just five and
[85:41] six years Almost 100% of your purchasing
[85:44] power has evaporated and Bitcoin bonds
[85:46] solve this problem Bitcoin bonds makes
[85:49] lending makes sense again and it also
[85:52] has the ability to recapit ize
[85:55] government programs that simply are are
[85:57] destined for failure because of the
[85:59] reality of their existing asset side of
[86:02] their balance sheet having less and less
[86:04] purchasing power over the years having a
[86:06] negative carry
[86:07] rate that was that was a lot thank you
[86:11] for that uh and uh it's really
[86:14] interesting I think many still
[86:19] underestimate what's possible with
[86:21] Bitcoin being integrated in the
[86:24] traditional Financial Market because
[86:26] just as Wall Street is greedy and want
[86:28] to do the the Bitcoin ETF there's a lot
[86:31] of other things that will come along the
[86:33] way the Bitcoin FF is not the the last
[86:35] thing that that happened in the Trish
[86:37] Finance uh system it's more or less like
[86:40] the maybe the first thing the first
[86:42] major thing that happened on that that
[86:44] front maybe Michael saor with micro
[86:47] strategy was the first real thing um but
[86:50] there's a lot to come in in that world
[86:53] and I'm really excited to to see all the
[86:55] products the companies uh all the
[86:57] excitements and and then also the the
[86:59] purchasing power win in Bitcoin it will
[87:02] be really interesting times yeah it's
[87:06] right now and and if I know that was a
[87:09] lot so what I recommend is for your
[87:10] listeners to just go to my Twitter and
[87:12] go to my highlights section where I have
[87:14] a written tweet thread of this and it's
[87:16] much easier to follow along because I
[87:18] know I I laid it all on you fast and I
[87:20] was jumping back and forth but the the
[87:22] basic concept is now now you can lend
[87:25] and get exposure to bitcoin you don't
[87:27] need to invest and you can lend in a way
[87:29] with principal protection so you can if
[87:32] someone said hey I you want to invest in
[87:34] Bitcoin they go yeah but I can lose no
[87:36] no not with this product well what do
[87:38] you mean I can't lose you can't lose in
[87:40] nominal terms you cannot lose you might
[87:42] lose some purchasing power but you're
[87:43] already losing purchasing power in
[87:45] government debt so there's no difference
[87:47] you can't lose in nominal terms and you
[87:49] can still get exposure you can still get
[87:51] access to the best performing asset in
[87:53] the world that's really what it
[87:55] simplifies down to and it and through
[87:57] that positive feedback loop the price of
[87:59] Bitcoin can go parabolic through this
[88:01] because if this were to be widely
[88:03] adopted that that feedback loop drives
[88:06] value into spot Bitcoin which then it
[88:09] must Force up the price that's what's so
[88:10] important about absolute digital
[88:12] scarcity if there's more demand there's
[88:13] a higher price and there's no other
[88:15] option and then the higher the price
[88:16] that goes the more yield on the Note
[88:18] right because the yield on the note is
[88:20] based on the performance of Bitcoin so
[88:22] we can leverage the performance of
[88:23] Bitcoin we can leverage the
[88:25] characteristic of absolute digital
[88:27] scarcity to empower we the people to
[88:30] recapitalize The Republic and to make
[88:32] any government program right now that is
[88:35] is struggling to give it a chance to
[88:37] actually succeed uh and to succeed in a
[88:39] way where in the long term those
[88:41] benefits might be able to to increase
[88:44] rather than being forced to decrease and
[88:46] I think you know this is an option that
[88:48] all governments and all companies all
[88:50] states all provinces all cities
[88:54] municipalities and corporations will be
[88:57] forced to consider eventually but right
[89:00] now in the beginning it's a great time
[89:02] to take advantage of these new products
[89:04] and services that are going to be coming
[89:05] to the marketplace and they're going to
[89:07] pop up everywhere they're going to pop
[89:09] up because the Fiat system is dying the
[89:12] Fiat system is broken and this is like
[89:17] we were talking earlier it's kind of
[89:18] like a temporary fix but in the long run
[89:21] it's part of Bitcoin becoming that
[89:22] trojan horse being ated into the system
[89:25] forget about digitizing all these trafi
[89:28] debt products it's time to innovate it's
[89:31] time to take what Bitcoin is and
[89:33] integrate it through Innovation rather
[89:36] than um just making it a store of value
[89:39] it's going to be a medium of exchange
[89:41] but let's make it the most pristine form
[89:43] of collateral in the world first let's
[89:45] do what we can do now to accelerate
[89:47] Bitcoin adoption and to accelerate the
[89:49] benefits to Society at large uh by
[89:53] leveraging it's most amazing numberg go
[89:56] up technology that we've ever seen yeah
[89:59] and I think it's important to um notice
[90:02] that money has to go through the faces
[90:04] like it seems like oh yeah Bitcoin has
[90:06] not been a unit of account for 15 years
[90:09] it has failed therefore like that's
[90:11] that's so funny to me like study study
[90:13] history study how long gold needed study
[90:15] how long any money needed to to be
[90:17] established as a store of value the me
[90:19] of EX change and everything it's it's uh
[90:22] stunning that Bitcoin is already wearing
[90:24] is like in just 15 years uh and and
[90:27] people are still unsatisfied now why can
[90:28] I not buy everything in Bitcoin right
[90:31] now and their taxes and everything calm
[90:33] down patience my
[90:35] friend um really cool um we come to the
[90:38] end now um where there are two questions
[90:41] the first question is always the same
[90:43] question for every guest I think I think
[90:46] last time we spoke we did not have the
[90:48] question I did it after yeah I think I
[90:52] did it after the 100th episode you like
[90:54] 80 or something like that and the
[90:56] question for you is what can we learn
[90:57] from you besides Bitcoin besides all the
[91:00] things that you we already covered yeah
[91:02] I think I think the best thing is is
[91:04] that even if you're a Bitcoin
[91:06] billionaire that's not enough because
[91:09] the time that we're moving into is going
[91:11] to be a time of trouble it's going to be
[91:14] a time of being able to be sure that you
[91:17] have not just Bitcoin to protect your
[91:19] wealth but but how about some uh second
[91:23] Amendment rights how about a weapon to
[91:26] protect your family for self-defense how
[91:28] about the ability to produce food and
[91:31] water and energy and
[91:33] Community uh these these things are of
[91:35] the utmost importance so you'll see me
[91:38] on my Twitter I I allude to these things
[91:40] that it's not just important to
[91:43] understand Bitcoin but once you
[91:45] understand Bitcoin you don't have to
[91:46] dive as deep as you and I do into it
[91:48] once you understand it you just add it
[91:49] to your balance sheet let Bitcoin do the
[91:51] hard work but your work is not done
[91:53] there
[91:54] you need to learn how to defend your
[91:55] family to access water and food and
[91:59] Community to go out and to meet
[92:01] bitcoiners and shake their hands and
[92:03] grow the per the personto person economy
[92:06] that is the the the utmost important
[92:07] thing that I give as a message besides
[92:11] Bitcoin and the Bible Bitcoin Bible and
[92:14] then preparedness so that that would be
[92:16] my answer get prepared get get Bitcoin
[92:18] in your balance sheet read the word of
[92:20] God and and go out and make friends and
[92:23] community members and barter with them
[92:25] trade with them uh establish a means of
[92:28] security a plan of action in case the
[92:30] worst case scenario happens because you
[92:32] know we're we're praying for the best
[92:34] but we're preparing for the worst
[92:36] absolutely and I think that's also a
[92:38] great Gateway because uh we talked about
[92:41] preparing for hyper bit conization we
[92:43] preparing for the feat fall I think in
[92:45] the last episode actually with you if
[92:48] people want to see that just go on my
[92:49] channel search for the name you will see
[92:52] those two episodes uh popping up and the
[92:54] last one is really cool you can also see
[92:56] a little bit the progression of of the
[92:58] of the channel I hope you see a quality
[93:01] increase not decreas over the time uh
[93:04] yeah so thank you already uh so much for
[93:06] coming on um now to the end routine with
[93:09] the guest where the previous guest is
[93:11] asking a question for the next guest
[93:12] without knowing who the next guest
[93:13] actually is your question from the
[93:15] previous guest from Peter dunworth uh is
[93:18] what's the most important thing uh for
[93:21] you personally about Bitcoin I think
[93:23] think the the most important thing about
[93:25] Bitcoin is that it's engineered money so
[93:29] we have gold as a natural money and we
[93:32] learned many Fantastic characteristics
[93:35] of gold um of money through gold and
[93:39] what we're seeing is we're we are now
[93:41] moving into the techn technological age
[93:44] right we had a candle and then we went
[93:47] we had a technological Evolution we did
[93:49] the light bulb and we had a horse and we
[93:52] went to a car and we had paper articles
[93:55] and now everything gets on your cell
[93:56] phone and tablet we have paper money and
[93:59] the next technological evolution is is
[94:02] digital money and Bitcoin is the perfect
[94:05] digital money it's the engineered form
[94:07] of the natural and that absolute digital
[94:11] scarcity and the difficulty adjustment
[94:13] like we talked in our previous episode
[94:16] those are so important to bitcoin
[94:19] playing the role that it does in having
[94:22] monetary law right so now that that
[94:24] monetary law works for us and that
[94:27] monetary law protects everybody in the
[94:29] system without showing bias it now
[94:32] allows us to show bias so that we can
[94:35] make the world a better place so that we
[94:37] don't have to depend on the government
[94:38] to show bias and tell us what's right
[94:40] and wrong but in our spirit we can stand
[94:43] up for what we know is right and good uh
[94:45] to make the world a better place and
[94:47] that's that all comes from bitcoin's
[94:49] design of engineered money and I that's
[94:52] the most important element
[94:54] ah so beautiful perfect thank you CJ for
