[00:00] bull market from a retail perspective
[00:02] has not begun so we haven't seen that
[00:04] yet I know people thinking oh the bull
[00:05] Market's gone and we're back into a bare
[00:07] Market already like we haven't had a
[00:08] bull market the price movement has been
[00:10] from institutional buying from the ETFs
[00:12] from companies putting Bitcoin on the
[00:14] balance sheet from old bitcoiners buying
[00:16] more we've got 10 years of history and
[00:18] 10 years of data and we are Bitcoin only
[00:21] for that data as well yeah I was wrong
[00:23] with expecting 100K being that price
[00:26] point that was the mental barrier for
[00:28] for the general public and the retail
[00:29] and expect them to start moving in
[00:31] doesn't matter which other coin you can
[00:33] throw out there they all have some
[00:35] general central point of failure they
[00:37] all have that central point of failure
[00:38] that Bitcoin doesn't so it it's just no
[00:41] common sense there's no logic around why
[00:43] you would put anything but Bitcoin in
[00:45] that strategic
[00:46] [Music]
[00:50] Reserve really cool to have you it's
[00:52] it's it's it's a pleasure um for for the
[00:54] people that that don't I mean you you
[00:56] have been in the industry so long like
[00:57] 11 years it's it's kind of impressive as
[00:59] we talked the Bitcoin only focus of of
[01:01] the company also um but but a few people
[01:04] that don't know you give us an overview
[01:06] of of what you do for
[01:08] Bitcoin yeah sure so uh we're a coin
[01:12] Corner we're a Bitcoin uh exchange um
[01:15] have been heavily focused on bitcoin for
[01:17] the last 11 years now coming up to 11
[01:19] years um we're based here in the aisle
[01:22] of man uh which is for people that may
[01:24] not know a small island just off the
[01:26] coast of the UK um we kind of sit as one
[01:29] of the British Isles as such um so we're
[01:31] British very much so but um kind of have
[01:33] our own country and our own jurisdiction
[01:36] our own regulatory body um yeah we're
[01:40] smallish team uh com about 40 people now
[01:43] um mostly here in the Alam man we have
[01:46] um a office in the UK with a few staff
[01:49] we also have an office in Dubai uh with
[01:51] a few staff as well um and just as we're
[01:54] slowly growing out as Bitcoin starts to
[01:56] become um obviously more popular as
[01:58] everybody's starting to see now we will
[02:00] start to Target more specifically I
[02:03] think jurisdictions as opposed to um try
[02:06] and grab the whole world all at once we
[02:08] we kind of take it a little bit more
[02:09] slow and steady I like that approach
[02:12] really cool and you mentioned um uh a
[02:15] report that that you did is something
[02:17] that you do on a on on a regular basis
[02:19] and and gather data from the
[02:21] industry yes so we've we've just
[02:23] released uh this week a um Bitcoin on
[02:26] the balance sheet report um I'll I'll
[02:29] come back to that in second but yeah
[02:30] we've we've this is kind of our one of
[02:32] our first real data reports should we
[02:34] say uh we've done some in the past
[02:36] around lightning um and a couple of
[02:38] other ones but nothing using our actual
[02:40] data to help show the industry and the
[02:42] public uh how and what people's
[02:45] behaviors are when using Bitcoin um so
[02:48] we did this one as initial one because
[02:49] obviously Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[02:51] right now is quite a Hot Topic um but
[02:54] what we see in the industry is public
[02:57] companies that are buying Bitcoin
[02:59] because it's it's public it becomes
[03:01] public uh publicly accessible data so we
[03:03] see micro strategy uh Tesla Etc where
[03:07] they've bought Bitcoin and that's the
[03:09] ones we know I believe I think is about
[03:11] 80 83 companies I think it was I saw a
[03:14] couple of days ago um that were public
[03:17] companies known to hold
[03:18] Bitcoin however private companies uh
[03:22] unless the private companies are
[03:23] shouting about it themselves nobody will
[03:25] ever know they hold Bitcoin um so what
[03:28] we've tried to do is obviously we have a
[03:30] lot of private companies that hold and
[03:32] and transact with Bitcoin with us um and
[03:35] we wanted to kind of share that but
[03:36] we've tried to obviously um it's
[03:38] completely Anonymous anonymized it's
[03:39] just the data and the the averaged um
[03:44] numbers across the board in some
[03:45] respects uh to make a sample uh batch of
[03:47] data to help keep everything OB
[03:50] obfuscated from one side um but give the
[03:52] public a general overview and a decent
[03:56] overview um to have almost a comparable
[03:58] alongside the public company
[04:00] um so you it's it's good to see the sort
[04:03] of ratios I guess in some some respects
[04:06] um and how many buying it we did a
[04:08] sample of of a hundred of our C our
[04:10] business customers um and them 100 that
[04:13] they've been buying for some of them for
[04:15] 10 years now I believe um where they've
[04:18] been you know we've got that data now
[04:20] for 10 years which I know a lot of
[04:21] people don't get um but it's good to see
[04:24] that the they are there's a lot of them
[04:26] there that are buying consistently the
[04:28] last 10 years for example um however
[04:30] they don't tell people about it they
[04:32] don't shout about it and we're not going
[04:33] to obviously expose them and say
[04:34] anything uh in that respect but it's
[04:36] good to know I think for the public that
[04:38] there are companies behind the scenes
[04:40] buying Bitcoin um lots of different
[04:43] scales as well not the micro strategy
[04:46] billions every every month or so um
[04:49] there's a lot that are much much smaller
[04:50] where they may be um you know 20
[04:55] 501 a time they are they are a lot
[04:57] smaller um but consistent um so yeah
[05:00] hopefully uh hopefully it's um received
[05:03] well by the public and it's useful
[05:05] information um and we're going to then
[05:07] hopefully continue throughout this year
[05:09] to release more of these sort of
[05:11] research reports that are based off uh
[05:13] what is now 10 years worth of coin
[05:15] Corner
[05:15] data that's super interesting
[05:18] and uh it's it's also I had just last
[05:22] week in in in my studio um uh from a
[05:25] local exchange here in Austria someone
[05:28] talking about the the private sector and
[05:30] he's saying like most of the private and
[05:33] he's only focused on on on the business
[05:35] side of things so only uh gaing to the
[05:38] businesses that want to buy Bitcoin with
[05:40] the balance sheet and he's like most
[05:42] don't want to tell anyone like most are
[05:45] just like hey I want to buy Bitcoin but
[05:46] I don't want to find it in the newspaper
[05:49] so so that that's the approach from a
[05:51] lot of businesses and so my thinking was
[05:53] like there's for every publicly traded
[05:55] company that comes new on the board and
[05:58] and adds to the list of like ad or 90
[06:00] companies that are now publicly traded
[06:02] and have a Bitcoin balance sheet they
[06:04] probably like hundreds of smaller
[06:06] private uh companies maybe even like
[06:09] more than that that uh are stacking but
[06:12] nobody knows and you might even use the
[06:14] products you might even know the
[06:16] companies but and they're stacking
[06:17] Bitcoin the CFO might be a bitcoiner but
[06:20] you just don't know about it because not
[06:21] every bitcoiner wants to be public like
[06:23] I met a lot of um uh PLS and ogs that
[06:27] have been in Bitcoin for for 10 years
[06:29] years and and and they know really great
[06:32] stories and and met them at conferences
[06:34] or meetups uh and I'm like hey you have
[06:37] an amazing story but they don't want to
[06:38] share it anywhere else except of meetups
[06:40] and then it's like if he already comes
[06:42] to Meetup there might be like hundreds
[06:44] of guys that never come to meet up but
[06:48] they are in Bitcoin since a long time
[06:49] and they're stacking so uh it's always
[06:51] interesting to see what's public and and
[06:54] what the majority is that just um is not
[06:58] public but still stacks on a daily basis
[07:01] yeah yeah it's exactly the reason why we
[07:04] we obviously we' never want to expose
[07:06] the the people from many years ago that
[07:09] um don't want to share their stories
[07:10] publicly but um it's great to see the
[07:12] high level detail of um numbers as with
[07:15] the stats to see that there are plenty
[07:18] of other people out there stacking um it
[07:20] just um they don't want to shout about
[07:23] um which is fair enough and you are
[07:24] completely right as well with the uh the
[07:26] companies that are stacking you will if
[07:28] you live in the UK
[07:30] um you will have
[07:31] likely walked into some of them shops um
[07:35] used their products um on on sometimes
[07:39] potentially regular basis uh without
[07:41] realizing but some of these companies
[07:42] are yeah buying Bitcoin or have done
[07:45] from many years ago um so yeah it's it's
[07:48] quite surprising um but it's good to
[07:50] good to see hopefully this day that they
[07:52] can see some of the categories for
[07:55] example uh we've got you know retail
[07:57] High Street shops you've got um nursing
[08:00] homes you've got
[08:02] um I think there's even charities in
[08:05] there there's quite a few Charities I
[08:06] believe um there's your local cafe down
[08:09] the street your P down the street
[08:11] there's there's such a range of
[08:13] businesses there's a a Building Company
[08:16] um the everything you can think of the
[08:19] the range is is so vast it's not a
[08:21] particular category of businesses that
[08:23] are buying it's I think as you touched
[08:26] on before Robin um you mentioned that
[08:28] the it could be a CFO at a company
[08:30] that's a Bitcoin and that's the reason
[08:32] why that company has it but it could be
[08:33] a CFO of a large nursing home chain for
[08:35] example and that is why they are buying
[08:38] Bitcoin um it's irrelevant of what the
[08:41] business is as such it's the kind of the
[08:42] people and the decision makers in the
[08:44] business that uh are driving the the
[08:46] adoption of Bitcoin why do you think
[08:48] they they're quiet about it uh there are
[08:51] companies that are very open about it
[08:53] they make make Market marketing for it
[08:56] uh as they've seen that it doesn't shock
[08:58] the existing customers if they are um
[09:01] saying they Bitcoin putting on a balance
[09:04] sheet uh and it maybe attracts some new
[09:06] customers that want to buy at a shop
[09:09] that has Bitcoin on the balance sheet I
[09:12] think there there's been um it's
[09:14] probably quite a range over the years so
[09:16] if we look back to we had a a customer I
[09:19] won't name the the merchant the business
[09:22] um but they were selling uh ebikes and
[09:26] they were accepting Bitcoin with us but
[09:28] this was back in 20 2021 maybe um and it
[09:33] was just around the time I think Tesla
[09:35] had accepted Bitcoin payments and then
[09:37] they pulled it for environmental
[09:39] issues um so this company that we about
[09:42] to launch accepting Bitcoin um it was
[09:44] only a couple of days before they were
[09:46] planning to launch um the Tesla news
[09:49] came out the environmental impact and
[09:51] they decided to stop and scrap it off
[09:52] because they were worried about what
[09:53] their customer base being an an
[09:55] electronic bike sort of company um and
[09:57] good for the environment company um they
[09:59] were worried what their customer base
[10:02] might think when they start accepting
[10:03] Bitcoin uh so some of them the the ones
[10:07] that especially accepting Bitcoin a lot
[10:09] of them do want the pr from it they want
[10:10] the attention and and that's a great
[10:12] thing for them um but the ones generally
[10:14] that are buying Bitcoin in the
[10:16] background probably 95% of them don't
[10:19] want to tell people and they're happy to
[10:20] just sit in the background and buy
[10:22] Bitcoin because it doesn't really um
[10:25] necessarily impact directly the pr and
[10:28] the attention that they would would get
[10:29] and the the customer base that they may
[10:31] attract from that I guess they may be
[10:32] not seeing that as a big enough uptick
[10:35] um as opposed to maybe the Privacy that
[10:38] they're happy to keep uh maybe they
[10:39] don't think about the marketing angle
[10:42] and the pr side of things that they
[10:43] could they could introduce with this um
[10:47] I think it is unfortunately there's no
[10:48] there's no one answer there's a there's
[10:50] a wide range of things where um people
[10:53] don't want to tell people because of um
[10:56] all the above reasons I've mentioned
[10:58] there the environmental impacts the um
[11:00] the banks we've even had in the past
[11:03] where they they almost don't want to um
[11:06] flag it and highlight it because their
[11:07] their banking relationships may be
[11:09] squeezed um we we have had that in the
[11:11] past and you know the UK is no exception
[11:14] to the rest of the world of what we've
[11:15] seen um in terms of banking restrictions
[11:18] and uh Banks
[11:20] closing uh accounts down for every
[11:22] reason possible um obviously coin Corner
[11:25] being a Bitcoin exchange we've struggled
[11:27] with banking over the years my personal
[11:29] accounts I've struggled with the years
[11:30] because of my association with Bitcoin
[11:32] um it's not easy so businesses when they
[11:35] look to buy Bitcoin of course the bank
[11:37] will see the transactions going through
[11:39] um but if they make a song and dance
[11:41] about that publicly then that bank may
[11:43] start to ask more questions um and begin
[11:46] to we have had them close accounts in
[11:48] the past um so yeah it's there's so many
[11:52] different reasons um everybody's
[11:55] different um yeah it's a hard to
[11:57] pinpoint a single one that's the the
[11:58] biggest one I would say biggest reason
[12:01] that's super interesting um and that
[12:03] report that that you are putting
[12:05] together you're basically collecting all
[12:07] the data that that you have through
[12:09] through the coin Corner uh platform and
[12:12] then you're are basic trying to see the
[12:15] the buying behaviors and and the
[12:16] behaviors of of the people um what are
[12:19] you seeing um is is that a more short
[12:22] term focus is also more on the on the
[12:24] long term uh of like bare markets bull
[12:28] markets
[12:29] um so I've got the report in front of me
[12:33] here so let me just flick through and uh
[12:37] tell you in terms
[12:39] of there's a couple of points on it that
[12:42] might be useful from a uh average
[12:45] transaction so obviously 10 years worth
[12:47] of data in some respects some of the
[12:48] companies obviously are newer than than
[12:50] 10 years so they maybe have signed up
[12:51] and registered in the last year or two
[12:54] um but the average transactions that the
[12:56] business has made over the lifetime
[12:57] which could be anywhere from pretty much
[12:59] one year to 10 years um the average
[13:02] transactions was 97 um so a very high
[13:06] level average over a 10-e period it
[13:08] looks like one a month in terms of a DCA
[13:10] in that respect so it's roughly about
[13:12] one a month um from them from the each
[13:16] business's transactions so I think that
[13:20] that in itself has showed slow and
[13:22] steady um and slow and steady purchases
[13:24] of Bitcoin over the years there's
[13:26] another I'm flicking on this because I
[13:28] know there is some good stats to sort of
[13:30] tie in with that um the other one which
[13:33] I was quite impressed with was the 60%
[13:35] of the businesses from the sample had
[13:37] never sold Bitcoin um so they've only
[13:40] ever bought Bitcoin uh which is
[13:42] obviously from a longterm perspective
[13:45] slow and steady longterm um and not
[13:48] selling so yeah there there's
[13:51] definitely um a good portion of the of
[13:54] the businesses that are just buying slow
[13:56] and steady over the long term um there's
[13:59] probably a very good portion hard to not
[14:01] say too much but there's there's a good
[14:03] portion that are old businesses that
[14:05] accumulated Bitcoin from many years ago
[14:08] um from even like the 2014 15 16 years
[14:12] and they accumulated quite a lot of
[14:15] Bitcoin and then over the last couple of
[14:16] years as the price has gone up they've
[14:17] just been selling small amounts as
[14:19] time's gone by sometimes so you'll have
[14:22] seen with uh Peter McCormack and his R
[14:26] Bedford and and the approach he took he
[14:28] called his conference cheat code in the
[14:30] sense of um the mentality of uh buying
[14:33] Bitcoin and putting on your balance
[14:34] sheet for a business is a cheat code to
[14:36] to running a business because
[14:37] theoretically the the Bitcoin value will
[14:39] continue to go up uh which means your
[14:42] balance sheet of your business continues
[14:43] to increase or even can potentially stay
[14:45] static for in as unlimited years in the
[14:48] theory um so what we've definitely seen
[14:52] is some of the businesses that had
[14:54] bought Bitcoin years ago had been
[14:56] effectively slowly over time selling bit
[15:00] Bitcoin along the way over the years um
[15:02] effectively to bump up their bound sheet
[15:05] and allow them to continue to maintain
[15:06] the business in years where they've had
[15:08] a poor year and it kind of pulls them
[15:10] out and allows them to continue
[15:12] operating without the need to for any
[15:13] debt or anything along them lines um
[15:16] we coin corner is probably one of the
[15:19] best examples in some respects um of
[15:22] that being uh Bitcoin the Bitcoin
[15:25] industry obviously we have four year
[15:26] Cycles so we have a two years of of ball
[15:28] of two year of bear um and during the
[15:31] two-year of bear you will see in the
[15:32] industry in the crypto industry
[15:34] especially you will see the likes of
[15:35] coinbase binance Etc this time was it
[15:39] two years ago they were just laying off
[15:41] so many people um scaling back volumes
[15:45] dropping because there's just no
[15:47] customers there anymore because the
[15:48] Market's back into the bare Market um
[15:50] and they have to scale back they have to
[15:51] go and take lots of EX external funding
[15:54] whether that's from Venture Capital side
[15:56] um or wherever they're getting the debt
[15:58] side from um whereas ourselves coin
[16:01] Corner we've been fortunate where we've
[16:03] been able to accumulate the Bitcoin in
[16:04] the earlier stages and then during the
[16:06] bare markets we're able to kind of
[16:08] Bunker down and allow us to maintain
[16:10] through the bare markets and if required
[16:12] we can sell some Bitcoin to maintain um
[16:15] and to stay in the business of where we
[16:17] are allowing us to keep and never have
[16:19] to lay off staff keep the the staff
[16:21] numbers as we are grow slow and steady
[16:24] and then be prepared for the bull market
[16:25] and um kind of hit the ground running
[16:28] with the the team that we have as
[16:29] opposed to trying to panic High lots of
[16:31] people when the bull market comes and
[16:32] then lay off when the bare Market comes
[16:34] so it's it's allowed us to be a bit more
[16:37] um our Revenue line should we say and
[16:39] and kind of everything's been a bit more
[16:42] um slow and steady and Flatline in some
[16:45] respect not Flatline but um more
[16:47] consistent it's probably the better way
[16:49] to word that over the years uh as
[16:51] opposed to what you will see with
[16:53] binance and coinbase Etc is very much a
[16:55] roller coaster alongside the the hype
[16:58] Cycles um so having Bitcoin on the
[17:00] balance sheet has definitely been uh
[17:02] beneficial for coin corner and as I
[17:05] mentioned there some of the other
[17:06] Merchant within the sample uh very
[17:09] similar Behavior where they've been
[17:10] selling during their bad years of
[17:12] business that's super interesting it's
[17:14] also uh fascinating the this Bull and
[17:17] Bear cycle with with businesses because
[17:20] it it is kind of a weird sign for the
[17:23] outside world also when you're hear in
[17:25] the bare Market all like those many lays
[17:27] Lay layoffs and
[17:29] uh in in that company those many layoffs
[17:31] in that company it's like okay that is
[17:34] is that is that industry really good and
[17:36] I think if we get more to a state where
[17:38] companies in
[17:40] Bitcoin uh and hopefully we make the
[17:43] distinction between Bitcoin and crypto
[17:45] more and more because it's still that
[17:48] the general population I feel like has
[17:50] crypto within Bitcoin and it's the it's
[17:52] the same category um so we have to make
[17:55] the distinguish in between there uh but
[17:57] people see uh that is that an industry
[18:01] where there's a lot of layoffs and a lot
[18:03] of hype and and those Cycles are huge or
[18:06] is it where there are businesses growing
[18:08] that are slow and steadily so I think uh
[18:10] what you're doing with with coincoin is
[18:12] really cool because it shows a slow and
[18:14] steady growth uh where you can capture
[18:17] actually the bull market but don't
[18:19] overdo it in the bull market and then
[18:21] don't underdo it in in the bare market
[18:23] and I think that's the Bitcoin way and
[18:25] the other thing is more the uh let's
[18:27] call it the altcoin way
[18:29] yeah it is exactly that and it's um it
[18:32] kind of ties into there's another point
[18:34] that we've or some of the data we've um
[18:37] noticed it's not been released yet
[18:38] because it's more of the retail audience
[18:40] um data that we're going to be releasing
[18:41] in the coming weeks uh but that one very
[18:45] similar to what you're saying there in
[18:46] terms of um our customer base is that
[18:49] slow and steady customer base so our
[18:50] customer base we've realized is the
[18:53] older generation should we say um when I
[18:55] say older generation I'm talking sort of
[18:57] Millennials onwards Gen X Boomers um
[19:00] whereas when we've looked at um the
[19:03] crypto audience should we say which is
[19:05] like your coinbase your binance Etc that
[19:07] crypto audience is genz and slowly
[19:10] bleeding into Millennials um but their
[19:13] the majority of their customer Bas is
[19:14] Gen Z and Millennials as opposed to ours
[19:17] being much older um and I think that's
[19:19] where the differen is during the bare
[19:22] markets the genz ETC get they've tried
[19:25] to get rich quick I guess on crypto um
[19:27] they've got burn or got bored and the
[19:29] markets come down so they they disappear
[19:31] and they forget and they're distracted
[19:33] and go off with something else whereas
[19:35] the customer base we have continue
[19:37] through the bare markets just DCA and
[19:39] over the time so it becomes um the slow
[19:42] and steady customer base which allows us
[19:44] to maintain that level of consistency
[19:45] throughout the years um so it's
[19:47] definitely a difference between Bitcoin
[19:49] and crypto is an age Gap um quite
[19:53] heavily and I think with age comes risk
[19:56] maybe so the Younger You Are higher
[19:58] risks you will take um as opposed to as
[20:01] you get older you begin to take lower
[20:02] risks I think that's just a natural
[20:03] human behavior um and that's exactly
[20:06] what we think we're seeing with that
[20:07] where the older generation are happy to
[20:09] buy Bitcoin slow and steady um because
[20:11] it's less risky than crypto um so it's a
[20:14] good differentiation um and I'm quite
[20:16] looking forward to getting that sort of
[20:18] data out so you can show the
[20:19] differentiation between a Bitcoin
[20:21] company and a crypto company it's so
[20:24] also the age is is quite interesting
[20:26] because um uh I'm a a rare Bitcoin with
[20:30] 26 it feels like so so when I look at my
[20:33] own channel statistics um and I have
[20:36] around like 100 to 150k uh people uh
[20:39] watching in like a one month or three
[20:42] month period uh so it's not the biggest
[20:44] pool of people but it uh it's somewhat
[20:47] representative of bitcoiners uh and uh
[20:50] under my age there's almost nobody so
[20:52] like there's like 1% of my viewers are
[20:55] younger than me so like 99% of my
[20:57] viewers are older than me uh there's
[20:59] even like 78% that are above 65 years
[21:02] old which shocked me actually that that
[21:04] there are um uh
[21:08] basically almost the the generation
[21:11] between my dad and my
[21:13] granddad kind of that one uh that's
[21:17] super interesting to see and I think the
[21:18] average age is somewhere between like 45
[21:21] years old 43 years old uh when I last
[21:24] checked uh so it it honestly when I came
[21:27] into the Bitcoin
[21:29] it shocked me what the difference
[21:32] between crypto overall uh and and
[21:35] Bitcoin is and I think uh younger people
[21:39] are more screwed towards oh like let's
[21:41] gamble in some some altcoin just because
[21:44] they might not have a bigger
[21:46] responsibility of a family or company
[21:48] like that what's your how do you how you
[21:51] see the age difference because you
[21:53] probably have way more retail uh data
[21:55] than than I have just from YouTube it it
[21:58] almost I think exactly what you've the
[22:01] age you've said there so I think around
[22:02] 40 to 42 probably is about our average
[22:06] um so it is exactly what you're probably
[22:08] seeing the the Gen z uh generation so
[22:12] that's like 18 people kind of bracket
[22:15] them slightly different sometimes but 18
[22:17] to 25 sort of region let's say um that
[22:20] is a tiny tiny portion of our audience
[22:22] it's um maybe I can't remember the exact
[22:25] number but it's maybe about 3 or 4% um
[22:27] as opposed to Millennials being the
[22:29] biggest which is up towards
[22:31] 40 um and Gen X then being second
[22:36] biggest um which takes us into 50s uh
[22:40] but still Boomers being the the 50s at
[22:44] 55 plus Etc um the Boomers age actually
[22:47] is still a lot bigger than R genzi um so
[22:49] I think Boomers sits probably around 15%
[22:51] maybe uh as opposed to the genz a couple
[22:54] of percentage um it's it's quite the
[22:57] difference which we're trying to this is
[22:59] where we're trying to uh dig in at the
[23:01] minute and find researching crypto all
[23:03] of the crypto surveys we found it's
[23:05] massively crypto is
[23:07] genzi um and the coinbase data and the
[23:09] binance data that we were're able to try
[23:11] and publicly find uh again it's
[23:13] difficult because they're not really
[23:15] sort of disclosing much of that um but
[23:18] the bits that they do is always focused
[23:20] around gen Z being these customer their
[23:23] customer bases um which yeah is High
[23:26] Risk Takers gamblers which is crypto um
[23:29] and I think that that's the
[23:30] differentiator between Bitcoin and
[23:32] crypto for me going forwards um it's
[23:34] just highlighting that Bitcoin is a an
[23:36] investment purpose um and slow and
[23:39] steady long-term investment as opposed
[23:41] to crypto coin basic binance Etc are
[23:44] your casinos there you want to go and
[23:46] gamble get rich quick um and they are
[23:48] two completely different business models
[23:50] with two completely different customer
[23:52] bases quite honestly yeah I I saw some
[23:55] I'm currently searching it um there
[23:58] there is uh there came something out of
[24:02] of showing what the future shift in
[24:05] wealth is of like the the Boomers and
[24:08] and the the older Generations are slowly
[24:10] slowly going in retirement and slowly
[24:12] slowly um getting getting to the age
[24:15] where their wealth actually shifts uh to
[24:18] uh Millennials and and gen xas uh so so
[24:22] that that shift uh is is basically
[24:25] happening in within the next like 10 20
[24:27] years uh the number I think if I
[24:30] remember correctly was like 100 trillion
[24:32] that comes uh two generation down um uh
[24:36] which is is fascinating to see it it's
[24:39] it comes now to the generations where
[24:41] Bitcoin is more more present and where
[24:43] Bitcoin is actually the the more
[24:45] dominant form um which I think is super
[24:49] interesting to see because it's the
[24:52] generations that control the wealth that
[24:54] kind of controls where where the
[24:56] marketers are going
[24:58] uh and uh it's it's it's sad to see that
[25:02] we don't have more in the Gen C's
[25:05] because I'm On the Border like I'm
[25:07] actually a Genia um but uh it's actually
[25:11] for the next 10 20 years not that uh
[25:14] important it's more the Millennials and
[25:17] gen access uh and whatever comes above
[25:20] them I forgot um uh that are really
[25:23] controlling where where the wealth is is
[25:26] going and I think that's that's an
[25:28] interesting indicator of exactly do that
[25:31] uh cohort of people where Bitcoin is um
[25:34] getting more and more dominant there's
[25:36] the the trillions uh incoming yeah yeah
[25:39] it is exactly that I think and the the
[25:42] Millennials and the the Gen X's are
[25:44] Bitcoin only um as the majority which is
[25:47] is exactly maybe what we in some regard
[25:50] maybe would expect um but yeah it's it's
[25:53] definitely interesting to start seeing
[25:54] this data now um it's kind of
[25:57] frustrating that we don't see more
[25:58] companies sharing more of that data as
[26:00] well and and sort of uh it helps with
[26:04] it's like industry research and you see
[26:05] the surveys um but the survey surveys
[26:08] are great in some respects where you get
[26:10] a uh kind of an overview and average of
[26:13] of some sort of feedback and and initial
[26:15] data but the problem with the surveys
[26:17] sometimes is obviously people can just
[26:18] make things up and lie um whereas
[26:22] hopefully data doesn't lie and data is
[26:24] um accurate and correct so we can with
[26:27] the data obviously we can then um make
[26:29] use of that for research purposes uh and
[26:32] it's great to then see and understand
[26:33] how the industry is evolving um how we
[26:37] can then start to figure out how do we
[26:40] help uh everything from like regulations
[26:43] and how you're helping differentiate
[26:44] Bitcoin and crypto like we can take
[26:46] these arguments to regulators and say
[26:47] look maybe they should be regulating the
[26:50] two separate uh which is ironically um
[26:54] one of the things that uh Gary gendler
[26:56] in the US was was trying to do even
[26:58] though he became quite the enemy of the
[26:59] industry for for a period of time um he
[27:02] was still trying to differentiate
[27:04] Bitcoin and crypto um which I saw as a
[27:07] positive that was in my head that was a
[27:09] positive I appreciate the administration
[27:11] at the time and and Gary Guna squeezed a
[27:13] lot of the the companies over there but
[27:16] again look at the companies they
[27:17] squeezed they were crypto um they
[27:19] weren't necessarily Bitcoin there was no
[27:21] Bitcoin only company in that list of of
[27:23] companies they were targeting um because
[27:25] Gary did separate Bitcoin and crypto and
[27:27] he saw Bitcoin as commodity and and more
[27:30] of the crypto uh being a
[27:32] security um so hopefully with this data
[27:35] we can start to help I guess educate um
[27:39] Regulators educate people educate the
[27:42] general public media um and help make
[27:44] use of that uh in in hopefully positive
[27:47] ways for Bitcoin and to show bitcoin's
[27:49] adoption how do you look at uh someone
[27:52] that is not from uh America at the
[27:56] Strategic Bitcoin Reserve uh s are also
[27:58] doing a lot of the differentiation
[28:01] between Bitcoin and crypto more and more
[28:04] even Trump says now like uh Bitcoin and
[28:07] crypto which which uh I hope it gets
[28:09] more and more in that direction yeah um
[28:12] yeah I mean it's great to be honest we
[28:14] it's something we've been saying for
[28:15] many years and people always say yeah
[28:18] but what about this coin and this coin
[28:20] and this and it's like I've had the same
[28:22] argument for 10 years with people and uh
[28:25] it feels like it never seems to change
[28:26] but I'm hoping um more so now we might
[28:29] start to see a change now US Government
[28:32] people will take that with more
[28:33] credibility um and them SE them
[28:36] differentiating that is absolutely great
[28:38] news I think that's one of the the
[28:40] biggest things that people are kind of
[28:42] missing in some respects for the Bitcoin
[28:44] strategic Reserve um it's great that
[28:46] they're they're looking to do a
[28:47] strategic reserve and they're going to
[28:48] have they're going to be buying Bitcoin
[28:50] in some capacity or so they say um but
[28:53] the the big thing for me was that
[28:54] differentiation between Bitcoin and
[28:56] crypto and I
[28:59] um had we on the podcast uh we do
[29:03] internally here at coin Corner we were
[29:04] actually having the same conversation on
[29:07] uh what before the Strategic Reserve
[29:10] came out and there was rumors about them
[29:12] including cardano and xrp and all these
[29:14] things in there um and we have quite the
[29:17] the debate uh on what it would be and I
[29:19] was saying like if you take a step back
[29:21] and think I know obviously politicians
[29:24] and Etc can there can be corruption
[29:26] there can be um Miss education and and
[29:29] things like that but if you take a step
[29:30] back and think from a a logical point of
[29:32] view how would why would a country buy
[29:36] they want something strategic that is
[29:38] going to be something that no other
[29:40] country can effectively control um and
[29:43] the point of it is is exactly that it's
[29:45] a a reserve that they can fall back onto
[29:48] um should anything globally happen and
[29:51] that can be so sanctions are always the
[29:52] obvious one um where countries get
[29:55] sanctioned but actually if they're
[29:56] holding um
[29:58] xrp for example picking on xrp um do you
[30:02] why would the US buy xrp from a
[30:04] strategic point of view when Ripple
[30:07] which controls xrp um is a US company
[30:10] can effectively be controlled by the US
[30:12] government why would the US government
[30:15] buy that when no other country in the
[30:17] world outside of the us is going to
[30:18] bother touching that and going to bother
[30:19] with that because it wouldn't make sense
[30:22] for China to buy xlp because if they buy
[30:24] that and then us and China fall out in
[30:27] any Capac
[30:28] and you know the US just says to Ripple
[30:31] right seize that xrp that China R take
[30:34] it back pull it back and ripple will do
[30:35] so um it's literally no use to China so
[30:39] they have to go
[30:41] to the I guess the the most
[30:43] decentralized um cryptocurrency there
[30:46] there is and the most sustainable
[30:49] reliable um and that is Bitcoin at the
[30:51] end of the day and that is where it will
[30:53] come back to that it doesn't matter
[30:54] which other coin you can throw out there
[30:57] um they all have some general central
[30:59] point of failure they've all they I mean
[31:01] I won't even get into the technical
[31:03] aspect of of their failures but um they
[31:07] all have that central point of failure
[31:08] that Bitcoin doesn't so it it's just no
[31:11] common sense there's no logic around why
[31:13] you would put anything bought Bitcoin in
[31:14] that strategic reserve it was super
[31:17] fascinating for me to see how people
[31:21] like Brian Armstrong uh with coinbase
[31:24] who offers a lot
[31:26] of a lot of shitcoin I mean probably
[31:28] almost all of them um he was going out
[31:32] and saying arguing oh like it's it
[31:34] should be only Bitcoin action the
[31:35] Strategic Bitcoin surve so like uh he
[31:38] personally recommends uh to to United
[31:40] States all like please only do do do the
[31:43] Bitcoin one uh but they're offering all
[31:46] the other things to to to to make money
[31:50] which I found was was an interesting
[31:52] thing because it's not his personal
[31:54] reputation when customers Buy kadano on
[31:58] his platform but if because of his
[32:00] recommendation the United States
[32:02] president is buying gadano and his
[32:04] strategic Bitcoin Reserve then all of
[32:06] the sudden he's like oh like only
[32:07] Bitcoin is secure like Focus please only
[32:10] on bitcoin that was that was an
[32:11] interesting uh thing to see that also
[32:14] those Casino owners know it's Bitcoin
[32:16] only y yeah it speaks volumes it speaks
[32:20] volumes it really does it is uh it was
[32:22] good to see that I think the wink ofos
[32:24] twins came out as well and said the same
[32:26] thing um from Gemini perspective uh
[32:29] there was a couple of others as well I
[32:30] think was it the Kraken Kraken CEO I
[32:32] think had said similar it wasn't Jesse
[32:34] but it was the new CEO um there was yeah
[32:37] there was quite a few that basically had
[32:38] said yes Bitcoin only makes sense and
[32:40] the rest don't which is crazy
[32:43] considering they sell that to their
[32:44] customer base all the others to the
[32:45] customer base um but when it comes to
[32:47] themselves and their country and as you
[32:49] say their reputation they don't want to
[32:51] put their reputation on the line for all
[32:53] these other coins they would for Bitcoin
[32:54] but not for anything else um which just
[32:57] goes to show that I'm hoping the public
[32:59] annoyingly the general public that the
[33:01] retail audience that come in and
[33:02] eventually buy these altcoins they don't
[33:04] always they're not paying attention
[33:06] necessarily to these sort of uh these
[33:08] these news news outlets to the media to
[33:11] social media seeing what the likes of
[33:13] like Brian putting that tweet out there
[33:14] saying um it should be Bitcoin only that
[33:18] retail audience that goes to coinbase
[33:19] and buys XY and Z shitcoin is
[33:21] unfortunately may never see Brian's
[33:23] tweet about Bitcoin only um and it's
[33:27] it's a shame that and it's maybe
[33:28] something we have to as bitcoiners
[33:29] reiterate over the years to people um
[33:32] and educate people more on actually the
[33:35] the casino operator actually tells you
[33:37] just buy Bitcoin don't buy anything else
[33:39] um but that's that business model let's
[33:41] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[33:44] the beauty that coin vigilante has made
[33:47] with the Bitcoin watches those watches
[33:50] are the most amazing the most elegent
[33:53] way of showing that you are a true
[33:56] bitcoiner and coin gante just dropped a
[33:59] completely new and amazing Genesis
[34:01] edition of their watch collections you
[34:04] have the date of the first ever mined
[34:07] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[34:10] also the block height and which EPO we
[34:13] are currently in I love the level of
[34:16] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[34:19] make sure to check out those amazing
[34:21] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[34:24] descriptions I love those watches so so
[34:27] much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[34:30] really do hope that you don't have it on
[34:32] Exchange but if you do have it on
[34:34] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[34:36] with that the first way is you put it on
[34:38] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[34:41] you to get into the self custody game I
[34:44] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[34:47] for that it's a super simple and secure
[34:50] way and if you check out the link in the
[34:52] description you even get 5% off if you
[34:55] use the code Robin and this second way
[34:58] is the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is
[35:01] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[35:04] get the most out of your sovereignty
[35:07] they will personalize for you a self-
[35:10] custody setup that is perfect for your
[35:13] individual situation they will show you
[35:16] how you can secure your own devices
[35:18] securing your Bitcoin is not enough you
[35:20] also have to keep all your devices
[35:23] secure one topic that is overlooked
[35:25] often is the inheritance plan what
[35:28] happens with your Bitcoin once you are
[35:30] no longer here do you have a plan for
[35:33] that in place already and last but not
[35:35] least if you're in jurisdictions where
[35:37] you don't feel safe it's better to get a
[35:40] plan B for all that head over to the
[35:43] Bitcoin way.com
[35:45] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[35:49] just a quick side note I will be for the
[35:52] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[35:54] Prague event in June it will be
[35:57] absolutely absolutely legendary and I'm
[35:59] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:01] you there you can get your ticket in the
[36:03] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[36:06] Brock and very important use code Robin
[36:09] to get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[36:12] looking forward seeing you there it's
[36:14] super interesting because uh even uh
[36:16] even in my audience I know because I
[36:18] make uh Community polls to to figure out
[36:22] who who's watching and and to see a
[36:24] little get a little bit of a closer look
[36:26] and I made question of like oh do you
[36:28] own any altcoins like besides Bitcoin do
[36:31] do you own any um Co coins besides that
[36:35] uh and around 50% said
[36:37] yeah which is super interesting because
[36:40] I'm so focused on on bitcoin only and I
[36:42] hammer like there's there's only Bitcoin
[36:44] on my channel yeah I think there's
[36:46] there's an angle of um like if you want
[36:49] to go and buy altcoins Etc fine buy me
[36:51] but know that you're gambling so I think
[36:54] as people see Bitcoin as the investment
[36:56] side and then see the altcoins is just
[36:58] gambling to make more Bitcoin for
[37:00] example then perfectly fine Kon and you
[37:03] you go and do that um and I doesn't
[37:05] bother me and that's that's perfectly
[37:07] fine as long as you know that you are
[37:08] pretty much just gambling over there you
[37:10] are you have no it's not investment it's
[37:13] not there's no strategy around any of
[37:15] these other coins it is pure gambling um
[37:17] I think the problem becomes when people
[37:20] don't really understand that and the
[37:21] retail Market comes in and they're
[37:24] looking for the next Bitcoin and that
[37:26] they don't understand that they're
[37:27] gambling and they think they're putting
[37:28] their money in and they're investing and
[37:29] this is going to go to the same price as
[37:31] Bitcoin and that's um the the basic
[37:35] logic Falls like falls out it doesn't
[37:38] make sense to them and they're seeing um
[37:41] I think I've even seen more recently uh
[37:43] people talking about xrp and xrp is are
[37:45] like $2 whatever is um but they're
[37:48] saying you know that could go to $1,000
[37:50] and it's like you do realize that if
[37:52] that went to $1,000 the market cap of
[37:55] xrp would outweigh the whole of the
[37:57] world's Financial systems right now it
[38:00] couldn't it just that sort of logic just
[38:02] they don't see that they just see oh
[38:05] it's the next Bitcoin because the
[38:07] butcher down the road has told them this
[38:08] so they're going to go and jump in it um
[38:10] and they don't realize they're gambling
[38:11] and then they lose money um and that's
[38:13] where that's the bit I don't like and
[38:16] that's the bit I we' like to try and
[38:17] help educate on more but um that's a
[38:19] very very difficult education
[38:21] piece yeah the unit bi is is real I I
[38:26] get it all the time of like oh I want to
[38:27] get more Bitcoin and then when I buy
[38:29] this one weird meme coin it might go to
[38:32] 50 cents then I make like th X and I'm
[38:35] like yeah but if it goes to 50 cents
[38:37] it's two times bigger than Bitcoin do
[38:39] you really think that's
[38:41] happen like what they they don't see how
[38:44] how many of those coins exist and what
[38:46] is the coin price and and they look at
[38:49] the unit price and not at the market
[38:51] capitalization uh and also they don't
[38:53] look at any fundamentals they just it's
[38:55] Pro speculation and I this is actually
[38:58] thing that I also get a lot uh when I
[38:59] make those polls is like oh I just want
[39:01] to get more Bitcoin I don't I think it's
[39:04] a foolish strategy but uh if you want to
[39:06] do that go ahead and do that at least
[39:08] you see altcoins as what it actually is
[39:11] like gambling casino spec specul
[39:14] speculation from from that side um and I
[39:17] think it's interesting when we look to
[39:19] business adoption because businesses get
[39:22] like I've never really heard about
[39:24] businesses like oh like we buy that coin
[39:26] or we buy a a digital portfolio strategy
[39:30] where there are like the 50 big biggest
[39:32] cryptocurrencies uh businesses seem to
[39:35] to get oh it's it's it's actually
[39:37] Bitcoin Bitcoin only is that that also
[39:40] what you're seeing or do you see
[39:42] actually Bitcoin Bitcoin customers that
[39:44] also like oh we also buy ethereum um
[39:48] it's a good question um because
[39:50] obviously we are just Bitcoin only for
[39:52] these customers so we don't really see
[39:54] if they um maybe some of them do go so
[39:57] then binance for example and and buy XY
[39:59] and Zed um it's not really a question
[40:02] we've we've typically asked in in in a
[40:06] survey sense at least anyway um we've
[40:09] probably spoke to I've spoke to many
[40:11] over the years that have wanted to buy
[40:13] XY and z and we say Obviously we don't
[40:14] sell that so it's up to them to go find
[40:16] it elsewhere um a lot of them generally
[40:20] do come back and and and continue with
[40:22] the Bitcoin side whether they are
[40:24] continuing with the other altcoins in
[40:25] the background I guess we wouldn't know
[40:27] um yeah maybe that's a good uh survey we
[40:30] should maybe send out to the businesses
[40:32] and see see what the results are I I
[40:35] that's just pure belief no data at all
[40:38] but I have a general belief that um
[40:42] businesses um especially if they are
[40:44] buying Bitcoin since longer than one two
[40:46] years are probably Bitcoin only uh
[40:49] you've seen it I mean even like El musk
[40:52] with Tesla he's talking 90% then he's
[40:55] talking about cryptos I mean now he's
[40:57] not talking about group to at all uh but
[41:00] in the back in the days when he talked
[41:01] about it he talked about uh Dogecoin all
[41:04] the time yeah but he only bought Bitcoin
[41:07] and he mentioned in several interviews
[41:09] that he has uh like 10x was I think the
[41:12] number more Bitcoin uh value than than
[41:15] Dogecoin uh but he likes to troll on the
[41:17] internet and he likes to to to to do
[41:20] those things so I think if if it
[41:22] actually comes down the business
[41:23] decision and a CFO is like okay like are
[41:26] we actually inves
[41:28] in in in that that coin that this
[41:30] basically another company there's a
[41:32] whole another thing going on with a
[41:34] commodity like Bitcoin is like oh yeah
[41:36] like we should diversify in that I think
[41:38] it's the same same uh conversation that
[41:42] is happening on National levels with
[41:45] with USA where it makes just way more
[41:48] sense to be uh Bitcoin only uh and so I
[41:51] think the the bigger the company the
[41:53] more um um decision Hier in three are um
[41:58] it gets complicated that Bitcoin even
[42:00] gets in there but it's then Bitcoin only
[42:04] I think so maybe there are some small
[42:05] companies that like five people that say
[42:07] like oh I also buy ethereum because I
[42:09] hold it privately but that's a whole
[42:10] different discussion serious big
[42:13] business is probably are Bitcoin only
[42:15] yeah yeah I agree I think they will all
[42:18] be um Bitcoin only um the longer they
[42:22] hold it and I think you're right as each
[42:24] cycle passes people realize um and I
[42:27] think you you'll always get the the guys
[42:29] that will still maybe want to go and
[42:30] Gamble and have a play around with the
[42:32] other ones but that's at that point
[42:33] hopefully they've learned and they
[42:34] understand that they're going and having
[42:36] a little gamble um but you are right as
[42:38] businesses they shouldn't be necessarily
[42:40] gambling with their treasury um so it it
[42:43] would make no sense for the majority to
[42:45] to do anything like that um so yeah
[42:47] definitely
[42:49] um I think more widely Bitcoin only for
[42:52] businesses as opposed to retail what do
[42:55] you expect from uh business adoption uh
[42:58] in in general I think business adoption
[43:00] is is highly underrated in in the
[43:02] Bitcoin story till till now yeah I think
[43:04] it's still still I guess a slow and
[43:06] steady um for the most part I think
[43:08] we've seen maybe a bit of an uptick over
[43:10] the last 12 months um since the ETFs
[43:13] started kicking in and there was more
[43:16] interest from businesses around Bitcoin
[43:18] I think the Bitcoin the balance sheet
[43:19] from micro strategy um that's that
[43:23] portion and the more more public
[43:25] companies that are putting Bitcoin on
[43:26] the balance sheet that is definitely
[43:27] making more private companies pay
[43:29] attention so we are seeing that adoption
[43:31] start to increase it's not increasing at
[43:35] what we would have historically seen in
[43:37] a bull market for the retail um the
[43:40] amount of people that come in at a
[43:41] retail bull market Peak is like far
[43:44] outweighs um the B2B side um which is to
[43:48] be expected I guess um and maybe the
[43:50] ratio is is level um that's maybe
[43:52] something that we also have not looked
[43:54] at that data after a look and see um if
[43:56] that ratio is equivalent from retail and
[43:58] businesses uh as and when markets move
[44:02] um we know it is from the report we did
[44:04] in terms of the the price of Bitcoin
[44:06] always brings in fluctuations of new
[44:09] businesses and new retail um so as the
[44:12] price goes up um more come in um as I
[44:15] think is just typical um and obviously
[44:18] as the price goes down as well it starts
[44:19] to then die off in terms of new
[44:21] businesses new retail coming in um so
[44:25] yeah maybe I'll have a look at some of
[44:26] that data um after and see if I can um
[44:29] pull that into the next report maybe is
[44:31] do do you see also from uh 11 years you
[44:35] have gone through what three Cycles uh
[44:39] um which is is kind of amazing to see do
[44:43] you also have early indicators of buying
[44:45] behaviors of of retail where where you
[44:47] see uh bull markets uh slowing down or
[44:51] like bare markets trending towards bull
[44:54] market yes yeah we I generally we'll put
[44:58] things public whether it's on on one of
[45:00] our podcasts well whether it's on
[45:01] Twitter and I'll I'll post these things
[45:03] and um I will sort of say you'll see
[45:06] people being very bullish and bullish
[45:08] sentiments um but retail this this last
[45:10] 12 months retail have not been here um
[45:13] we even though it's been a bullish
[45:14] period um we haven't seen retail come
[45:17] back around yet um that's from we've
[45:20] seen it in very very small spikes so um
[45:23] when we look at our data and our charts
[45:25] we can see um sort of February March
[45:29] 2024 we had a bit of a spike and that
[45:31] was when the ETFs had kicked off the
[45:32] price went back to an all-time high um
[45:35] and the ETF interest brought a little
[45:37] bit of retail but it was not scratch on
[45:40] the previous Cycles it was it was Tiny
[45:42] it was a bit of a blip um and then we
[45:44] kind of went back into bearish numbers
[45:47] for probably the next six or seven
[45:48] months um and then it wasn't until
[45:50] October November when the presidential
[45:52] elections were coming up um and the
[45:54] November time and the Bitcoin price got
[45:56] moving to again another all-time high we
[45:59] then had a little bit of a spike again
[46:00] in terms of retail coming in new
[46:02] registrations and previous customers
[46:04] coming back um so we we see that Trend
[46:08] quite easily um I guess um and we track
[46:11] that almost on a daily basis and we get
[46:13] to see that um but the bull market from
[46:17] a retail perspective has not begun um so
[46:20] we haven't seen that yeah I know people
[46:22] thinking oh the B bull Market's gone and
[46:23] we're back into a bare Market already
[46:24] like we haven't had a bull market the
[46:26] price movement has been from
[46:28] institutional buying from the ETFs from
[46:31] companies putting Bitcoin on the balance
[46:32] sheet uh from old bitcoiners buying
[46:35] more um so I think the it's definitely
[46:40] not being new retail coming just yet um
[46:43] I think you will you'll generally see
[46:46] that from maybe like coinbase or maybe
[46:49] shout about things you kind of seen that
[46:51] in like nfts and things like that where
[46:54] we see and the meme tokens um where
[46:57] every cycle you get this new thing and
[46:59] nfts was was kind of last
[47:01] cycle nfts now are just flatlined and
[47:03] dead and until a new retail audience
[47:06] comes in to see this then that's not
[47:08] going to spike and not going to move um
[47:09] so you can kind of look at indicators
[47:11] around the industry to to see
[47:14] what what spikes and what sort of stage
[47:17] of of the bull market we are in and
[47:18] whether retail has has come back or not
[47:21] um similarly
[47:23] with um the meme tokens and meme coins
[47:27] you know coinbase Etc they're all
[47:29] listing as many meme coins as they can
[47:30] at the minute um because that's where
[47:32] they're getting their sort of volume
[47:34] their trades from um but a lot of that
[47:36] is not necessarily new customers it's
[47:38] old the customers that are in crypto
[47:40] already and they're all the ones that
[47:42] are gambling in there already that're
[47:43] they're not new retail that have come in
[47:45] yet and you will start to see I think um
[47:48] another Spike at some point of something
[47:50] whether it's me whether it's nft style
[47:52] some other token esque style thing um
[47:55] which will be a good IND indicator as
[47:57] retail coming in um but currently yeah
[48:00] all our indicators are saying no I mean
[48:02] the really obvious one is Google Trends
[48:05] because that's public to everybody um
[48:07] and if you go to trends. google.com um
[48:09] and you can type in um you know buy
[48:12] Bitcoin for example it's always good not
[48:13] to put Bitcoin because Bitcoin can be
[48:16] people searching for it as in people
[48:18] that are already in the industry
[48:19] searching for that search term if you do
[48:21] just buy Bitcoin um you can then look at
[48:24] that on a worldwide scale you can look
[48:26] at that over like year
[48:27] period um or even all time period is
[48:30] probably a good one um there we go let's
[48:34] hope this proves me right when you see
[48:36] that if you do that to like worldwide um
[48:39] and do that to all time 2004 to present
[48:43] um and you will see all of a sudden
[48:45] you've got the 2017 the big spike even
[48:48] the 2021 cycle there was diminishing
[48:51] returns in some respect and it's either
[48:54] very diminishing returns at this recent
[48:56] Spike I think the
[48:57] that's the November Spike and then
[48:58] slightly back is the March the ETFs
[49:00] which is what I was talking about we saw
[49:02] the exact same in coin Corner data and
[49:04] that's same spikes in new registrations
[49:07] um so our new registration flow follows
[49:09] kind of this chart if that makes sense
[49:12] um quite closely so sorry sorry go ahead
[49:16] sorry yeah saying it does you can very
[49:18] easily people can very easily come and
[49:20] look at things like this and see even
[49:21] though the price is increasing and we're
[49:24] getting a what would be considered an
[49:26] early bull Market in my head for from a
[49:28] price perspective the retail audience
[49:30] coming back in has not happened yet it's
[49:33] not new customers really at Mass coming
[49:35] in it's current customers it's
[49:37] businesses it's larger institutional
[49:39] sort of buying at the minute which is
[49:41] making uh price
[49:43] movements that's crazy uh so I I always
[49:47] made that uh mistake I just put Bitcoin
[49:50] in like I looked at Google Trends but
[49:52] just with Bitcoin but actually you're
[49:54] right with with new retail you buy
[49:57] Bitcoin is a way better search term and
[50:00] the
[50:01] difference like we are not even 10% Like
[50:05] We 9% where we are currently with with
[50:08] 2017 I mean 2017 was crazy it was also
[50:12] the year where I heard first about
[50:14] Bitcoin I was uh like 18 19 years old
[50:18] back there and I got invited to two
[50:21] different multi level marketing schemes
[50:24] on top of bit Bitcoin in that one year
[50:27] uh was seemingly a prime candidate for
[50:30] that uh didn't go in any one of those uh
[50:33] and and now uh 2021 was also a bigger
[50:37] discussion point I I can definitely say
[50:39] that also but definitely not as big as
[50:41] 20 uh 17 and actually it's it completely
[50:45] mirrors what what what I I've seen uh
[50:49] with the 100K because I I personally
[50:52] thought that uh we hit the 100K uh like
[50:55] November around that time
[50:57] and this this Spike goes up like like
[51:00] here where we are like maybe at 50% uh
[51:03] what we have from 2017 but that just
[51:06] didn't happen at all like nobody cared
[51:08] about 100K Bitcoin no I to be honest I I
[51:11] was wrong completely on that I expected
[51:14] um when we hit 100K I expected kind of
[51:17] retail to pay attention again and start
[51:18] going back in and we had them them tiny
[51:20] spikes but we didn't have the
[51:22] significant retail especially we had the
[51:25] initial burst for like a week or two um
[51:27] when it hit 100K but it was only a quick
[51:29] burst which is why um sometimes if you
[51:31] look at Google Trends and they're sort
[51:33] of they have a dotted line You'll see
[51:35] which is the up to-date or the one
[51:36] that's not quite finalized yet so
[51:39] they're sort of uh anticipating and
[51:41] expecting that this um search term ratio
[51:44] will be at a certain level and you will
[51:46] have seen sometimes on Google Trends I
[51:48] think people tweeted some pictures out
[51:49] where when we was hitting 100K that
[51:51] dotted line was almost higher than like
[51:53] the 2017 line but it was because there
[51:57] was a lot of searches in a very short
[51:59] period of time just within like that
[52:01] week of the presidential campaign and
[52:03] the um 100K price there's a lot of
[52:06] searches very very quickly but then it
[52:07] very quickly dies off and then over a
[52:10] peri longer period of time averages out
[52:12] and that's why it drops back down and
[52:13] the dotted line disappears eventually
[52:15] and it comes into a solid line which is
[52:16] the actual data um so yeah I was wrong
[52:21] with expecting um 100K being that price
[52:25] point that was the mental barrier for
[52:27] for the general public and the retail um
[52:29] and expected them to start moving in but
[52:32] they haven't really only in very short
[52:34] Burse um I guess what that mental
[52:37] barrier is now for the general public uh
[52:39] we have to maybe wait and see it could
[52:42] be just general markets as well and the
[52:45] you know the the 202 2017 was kind of in
[52:49] some respects I don't say an anomaly but
[52:51] 2017 was was brand new people were still
[52:53] hearing about it for the first time um
[52:55] and it was bit of a it was that was an
[52:57] absolutely crazy period and that spike
[52:59] is December by itself it was just 2017
[53:02] December was crazy um we had a lot of
[53:06] exchanges with turning registrations off
[53:08] um we we couldn't hand I spent months
[53:12] basically uh systems and things like you
[53:15] the websites we weren't expecting that
[53:16] level of traffic and that level of
[53:18] customers and I spent months personally
[53:21] because I was I'm a developer by trade
[53:23] so I was I originally built the system
[53:26] um and the system was fine in some
[53:28] respects but then because um it there
[53:31] was so many people coming on and we link
[53:33] into um various apis all around the
[53:36] world and different uh companies um
[53:39] there was levels where it was just
[53:40] falling over and people were just it we
[53:42] just couldn't do things I was having to
[53:43] manually process all sorts of things um
[53:46] and I spent months just firefighting
[53:47] because that was all I could do to keep
[53:49] the things ticking over to keep the
[53:51] system running I had to just firefight
[53:52] for months um but that was a crazy time
[53:56] 2021 I think we had it was covid there
[54:00] was
[54:01] the um obviously the money printer and
[54:05] um that was kind of uh from a whole
[54:08] Global Perspective the money PR kicked
[54:10] in in in all different capacities but
[54:12] that kicked in and the covid side of
[54:13] things really triggered things people
[54:15] were at home not at work um the that
[54:19] kind of I think was probably a big
[54:20] driver in in the retail Market coming to
[54:23] bitcoin because they're you know one
[54:24] site at home nothing to do
[54:26] um there some of them were getting paid
[54:29] depend on countries you were in ETC
[54:30] people for example in the UK were being
[54:32] paid to not go to work um and still be
[54:35] paid for a certain period of time uh
[54:36] another us did the stimulus checks um
[54:39] there was money flowing into the economy
[54:41] because they had to um and I think that
[54:43] drove retail audience to have had spare
[54:47] cash at that point to then potentially
[54:48] look into that also sat home board with
[54:50] spare cash what do they do they're going
[54:52] to go and look to things like this like
[54:53] from an investment point or crypto from
[54:55] a gambling
[54:57] um so that kind of drove I think the
[54:59] retail at that point this time again the
[55:03] mental barrier of $100,000 has passed
[55:05] and maybe that wasn't the the trigger
[55:07] for retail um maybe it will be the US
[55:10] buying it in their Bitcoin strategic
[55:12] Reserve they have strategic Reserve now
[55:15] they're introducing one um but they
[55:16] haven't bought any Bitcoin yet there may
[55:18] be at the point when they buy Bitcoin
[55:20] for the first time and actually announce
[55:21] that that will start to trigger
[55:23] obviously other countries and other
[55:24] people will start to see that and the
[55:25] media in the news and then that maybe is
[55:27] the the barrier the mental barrier for
[55:29] for the retail audience to start to pay
[55:31] attention again um that would be my best
[55:33] guess but I was wrong last time so
[55:35] anyone's anyone's guess on this one I I
[55:38] was I was expected and I kind of was um
[55:44] the first time I was disappointed was we
[55:46] have those bigger family meetings with
[55:49] around Christmas and easn and stuff like
[55:50] that um where I see a lot of people that
[55:53] I haven't seen for a year uh and and I
[55:57] was just on the table and I was like
[55:59] nobody cares about Bitcoin here like we
[56:01] are 100K it's so exciting with the
[56:04] election and possible strategic Bitcoin
[56:07] reserve and I was like yeah like there's
[56:09] this one aunt that is asking some
[56:11] question of like oh like what is this is
[56:13] this bitcon thing still alive I heard
[56:15] about it in the news but uh it it's
[56:18] generally like and they don't they don't
[56:20] care uh and and then when I saw the
[56:25] continuation of that I was like yeah
[56:27] actually it's not just my my broader
[56:29] family uh where I have my my core family
[56:32] that is all in Bitcoin but my my wi
[56:34] family is not in there but it's also
[56:36] just the general population that that
[56:38] seemingly uh doesn't care about that at
[56:40] all do you think we will ever reach a a
[56:45] hype Point like um 2017 again or is it
[56:49] just a different uh Beast of Bitcoin now
[56:53] and we have more of a steady and slower
[56:55] growth um it's good question um I think
[57:00] in some respects it's probably a slow
[57:02] and steady growth um in in my belief uh
[57:06] which it doesn't mean necessarily the
[57:08] price will be the slow and steady growth
[57:10] but I think from The Wider adoption of
[57:13] people buying Bitcoin is potentially a
[57:15] slow and steady growth which I know may
[57:17] go in the complete opposite direction in
[57:19] in some way to um what people see as the
[57:21] bell curve for the adoption cycles and
[57:24] and you see in the uh early adopter the
[57:26] or the innovators early adopters Etc
[57:28] into the laggards at the end um
[57:31] but um yeah I kind
[57:34] of kind of seeing it a little bit like
[57:36] that I think at the minute I think for a
[57:39] 2017 influx I think you would have to
[57:42] see
[57:44] um something more substantial around the
[57:47] world happening in in from an e e
[57:50] economic perspective and the economy um
[57:53] and I you know anything can happen as
[57:55] we've seen
[57:56] you know these past 10 or 15 years going
[57:59] back to even like the the 2008 financial
[58:01] crisis onwards there's there's been some
[58:03] unprecedented um history been made with
[58:06] with obviously the the banking crisis um
[58:09] the covid periods um there's there's
[58:11] been a lot
[58:13] where we obviously can't foresee that
[58:16] sort of thing happening and and Co was
[58:17] never something that people would have
[58:19] foreseen and and expected um at the
[58:21] level it went to um so anything like
[58:23] that could happen and could trigger a
[58:25] 2017 Style again and and you know it's
[58:28] whether that's um gold is always if if
[58:32] we think in the sense I suppose gold is
[58:34] a slightly different investor as well
[58:35] but you know gold can be um artificially
[58:39] made now and manufactured and things it
[58:41] costs more than the price of gold to do
[58:42] that right now but as technology
[58:44] improves then that can then be
[58:45] artificially made um same with diamonds
[58:47] is it I believe diamonds are
[58:49] artificially made diamonds now are
[58:51] cheaper to make than than real diamonds
[58:53] um and as technology changes that will
[58:55] um become cheaper and cheaper and
[58:57] cheaper similar with gold and other
[58:59] other investment sort of assets
[59:01] Commodities um whereas Bitcoin you can't
[59:04] do that so maybe if there's some major
[59:06] trigger point at that point you will
[59:07] start to see an influx of people leaving
[59:09] the likes of gold and uh any other
[59:11] assets that historically would have been
[59:13] whether it's a housing crash retail um
[59:17] real estate sorry uh housing crash um
[59:20] maybe there's things like that um I
[59:23] think it would have to be maybe a 2008
[59:25] crisis or a covid level crisis maybe to
[59:28] really trigger it um and not saying we
[59:31] may not we're not going to see that um
[59:33] in the shorts medium- term we may um but
[59:36] currently as we foresee it uh probably
[59:39] probably not um anything to trigger a
[59:41] 2017 level influx I don't
[59:44] believe I talked with with some guests
[59:46] already around that and and I strongly
[59:49] believe that even if we hit higher price
[59:53] points like half a million or a
[59:55] million most people like let's say 80%
[59:58] of people will still don't have Bitcoin
[60:00] or will still don't care about Bitcoin I
[60:02] think the the major Drive the major
[60:05] Drive of of Bitcoin isn't retail it's
[60:09] it's it's unfortunately big institutions
[60:12] it's companies it's maybe even nation
[60:14] states uh because Bitcoin is such a
[60:16] strategically important asset and Retail
[60:19] basically had now 15 years 14 years
[60:22] before the big institutions and and now
[60:25] the the asset kind of seems to to change
[60:28] change a little bit and maybe for for
[60:31] people to understand that the scale of
[60:33] that it's it's super interesting to to
[60:35] look at that um when we compare now 2017
[60:39] with with a price chart of where we were
[60:41] in December in the top and and now of
[60:44] the the crash down to 84k um we are 434
[60:51] per higher than than that level uh and
[60:54] and then again
[60:56] to that interest chart uh we were there
[60:59] here at 100% And and here at like nine
[61:02] so the interest was in
[61:05] 2017 more than 10x higher uh but the
[61:09] price uh was just uh um is now um
[61:16] 43% higher than than it was
[61:18] 2017 uh so which tells
[61:22] me a few things and I'm curious what you
[61:25] think on that but a few things like the
[61:28] the people that buy Bitcoin buy more
[61:31] Bitcoin they're going deeper they're
[61:32] having more conviction they're not only
[61:35] oh like I buy Bitcoin with like 1% but I
[61:37] buy Bitcoin with like 10 20 30 maybe
[61:39] like over 50% of my wealth but then also
[61:42] the pockets that come in have deeper
[61:44] Pockets uh and and just bigger buyers uh
[61:47] so we don't need the hype anymore in
[61:51] Bitcoin if if that makes sense yeah
[61:54] exactly that so we again the as I
[61:56] mentioned the the research report we're
[61:57] going to put out on the on the retail
[61:59] audience um in the coming weeks that
[62:02] effectively shows similar to what you're
[62:03] saying there with the conviction so back
[62:07] in 2017 the the amount of people
[62:10] interested in Bitcoin were there there
[62:11] was a lots of them but they weren't
[62:13] buying
[62:15] $100,000 like chunks of of Bitcoin they
[62:18] were buying $100 worth they were buying
[62:20] small amounts because it was brand new
[62:23] they just heard about it they didn't
[62:24] want to miss out it was a bit of a fomo
[62:26] mentality where they were jumping in but
[62:28] they were only putting money in that was
[62:30] like spare money effects that they could
[62:32] theoretically at that time as well they
[62:33] would have seen it as maybe a bit more
[62:34] gambling and higher risk so they were
[62:36] only putting smaller amounts in so even
[62:39] though um if we look at that from our
[62:42] customer perspective and coin corner I'm
[62:44] trying to think back in my head and out
[62:45] to charts and how that looks um but we
[62:48] would have uh in 2017 the biggest
[62:52] December 2017 for example probably the
[62:54] biggest retail signups we ever saw on
[62:56] the platform in a single month yet the
[62:59] volume in that month is Tiny in
[63:03] comparison to what we do today we'll do
[63:05] um most of the time uh could be 20 times
[63:11] maybe now what we did in volume in that
[63:13] month as the most popular one so we had
[63:15] the most people ever coming in in
[63:17] December 2017 but every month at the
[63:19] minute for the last two years for
[63:21] example we've probably done more actual
[63:23] volume in buys over that say two-year
[63:26] period on average every single month
[63:28] than we did in the 2017 December um so
[63:31] that shows that even though the customer
[63:33] the amount of customers were there the
[63:34] amount the volume they were buying was
[63:37] so much tinier than it is today so the
[63:39] conviction of them customers as they've
[63:41] bought maybe $100 back then now they're
[63:44] more comfortable to buy $1,000 every
[63:46] month now and it kind of increases in
[63:48] time um and as conviction increases a
[63:51] percentage of people's portfolio
[63:53] increases we've seen exactly that with
[63:55] black rock
[63:56] um with Larry um Larry Fin and he was I
[64:00] think originally when um they first were
[64:03] going to do the ETFs did they say
[64:05] between one to 2% should be allocated to
[64:07] bitcoin as your portfolio and I think
[64:09] that crept up eventually to six to 7% I
[64:13] think and there was a ridiculous one at
[64:15] one point that where they said I think
[64:16] something like 60% of your portfolio
[64:18] should be in Bitcoin um and I you can
[64:20] see how I can't what that number was
[64:22] exactly so um people don't quote me on
[64:25] that listen um but the they were um
[64:29] increasing as time goes by and as
[64:31] confidence goes by uh it's the the Lindy
[64:34] effect with the the longer something
[64:36] survives the more confidence and the
[64:38] longer it will survive going forwards um
[64:40] so I think that's definitely happened
[64:42] with Bitcoin and people's um
[64:44] understanding and their confidence and
[64:47] conviction in it increases as time
[64:49] passes and the longer they are in
[64:51] Bitcoin so you will definitely see you
[64:53] are right the all the customers are
[64:55] buing more now than they were in
[64:58] 2017 that that makes a lot of sense and
[65:01] super
[65:02] interesting do to see uh the the the
[65:06] feeling that I have uh uh kind of
[65:09] confirmed with data that you actually
[65:11] have yeah from that because I I I can
[65:13] only go from from the feeling that I
[65:15] have from all the guests that come on
[65:17] and from the the replies and the
[65:19] community that I get but it seems to be
[65:21] quite accurate uh in terms of actual
[65:24] data that's that that's super cool to
[65:25] see yeah it's good I I was and this is
[65:28] kind of why we thought um towards the
[65:30] end of last year was kind of thinking
[65:31] about things in terms of uh the data and
[65:33] we we found ourselves I guess in quite a
[65:35] unique position around the world where
[65:38] we've got 10 years of history and 10
[65:40] years of data and we are Bitcoin only
[65:43] for that data as well so we can heavily
[65:45] show um I guess the growth the
[65:48] conviction the um the commitment from
[65:51] the retail audience because majority of
[65:53] our customer base is retail audience um
[65:55] or investors retail um as opposed to to
[65:59] B2B side um but we can actually show
[66:02] that to people so we realize that and
[66:04] that's why we we're starting to release
[66:06] these reports and we've been digging
[66:07] into the data more to help show this a
[66:09] nice friendly scale um and you will see
[66:13] that's the exact um kind of bit of data
[66:16] I was looking for from these reports is
[66:18] what you're touching on there I wanted
[66:19] to see the same customers for example
[66:22] from 2017 18 19 Etc I wanted to see how
[66:25] much their average buy was over the
[66:27] years and did the average buy increase
[66:30] over the years so as you've come into
[66:31] 2024 as the average buy crept up and up
[66:34] and up and up over time um and I I
[66:37] haven't seen the comparable yet side by
[66:40] side yet but um um pretty confident that
[66:42] is the case and that you will have seen
[66:45] back in the 2018 period the average buy
[66:47] I think was like 200 pound or something
[66:49] like that um but then over coming up to
[66:52] 2024 we're then starting to see more
[66:54] like 350 400 average buys and hopefully
[66:58] we we'll chart that as well for the
[66:59] public and we'll chart that against over
[67:01] the years of the last six or seven years
[67:03] and you'll be able to S see the the
[67:04] average hopefully increasing on the
[67:06] chart um and it will back up exactly
[67:08] what you're
[67:09] thinking really really cool um one more
[67:12] topic I want to get into with with you
[67:15] is is the game theory um you uh I think
[67:19] you and coin cor are uh based in in the
[67:22] UK If I got that right right in yeah the
[67:25] the AL of
[67:26] specifically but yeah yeah um so so how
[67:31] do you look at the game theory between
[67:33] what's going on right now in in America
[67:36] and they're talking about strategic
[67:37] Bitcoin Reserve they're already building
[67:39] that they're planning to even extend
[67:41] that and then we have Europe where
[67:43] Germany is selling the UK is also not
[67:47] doing a lot with with Bitcoin publicly
[67:49] and there's this EU and launching an
[67:52] possibly cbdc in I think October like
[67:55] that what I heard um soort of digital
[67:57] Euro um how do you look at Europe versus
[68:01] um uh America with with game theory in
[68:05] in Bitcoin adoption and maybe also from
[68:07] political level versus like the the
[68:09] actual Grassroots uh level yeah um I
[68:13] think the unfortunately uh Europe is
[68:17] falling way way behind um and Game
[68:20] Theory has not quite worked for Europe
[68:23] with the US going on the strategic
[68:25] Reserve side um they've almost said
[68:28] screwed up the the game theory process
[68:30] thrown that out the window and they're
[68:31] trying to run the complete opposite
[68:33] direction of um I think squeezing it too
[68:36] much um and Str effectively Europe are
[68:39] doing what the Biden administration had
[68:41] done in the US and that is at the
[68:45] negative to the industry um and to the
[68:48] general public and the retail audience
[68:49] and and everybody out there in Europe um
[68:52] UK being included in in that Europe uh
[68:54] sense as well I guess um obviously
[68:56] different regulator but they there's
[68:58] still the the issues around it don't get
[69:01] me wrong the UK hold a lot of Bitcoin at
[69:03] the minute um due to seized assets uh
[69:06] what they're going to do with that is is
[69:08] anyone's guess I know there's a lot of
[69:10] people trying to push them to do similar
[69:11] to the US um at least now the US have
[69:15] done it there will be a different kind
[69:17] of pressure on the UK to look at that to
[69:19] say um maybe we shouldn't sell this
[69:21] maybe we should put this into a
[69:22] strategic Reserve uh whereas if the US
[69:25] hadn't have done that then the UK
[69:27] wouldn't have even thought twice about
[69:28] it they'd just be selling it as soon as
[69:29] they can and off they go um so I think
[69:32] the the US strategic Reserve has
[69:34] definitely created that trigger point
[69:36] and the begin beginning should we say of
[69:38] of some sort of Game Theory where other
[69:40] countries have to actually ask the
[69:42] question should we sell this or should
[69:44] we hold it um and they'll eventually
[69:46] then have to ask the question should we
[69:48] buy more of it should we mine more of it
[69:51] um obviously we've got El Salvador we've
[69:53] got they've been buying mining Etc us
[69:56] now um holding seized but potentially
[69:58] looking to buy uh we've got butan butan
[70:01] um who've been mining Bitcoin for a
[70:03] while now and have gained quite a a
[70:05] portfolio there uh we've got the uh the
[70:08] UAE with um the Abid daab wealth fund um
[70:12] had been buying Bitcoin recently as well
[70:14] in the billions um there's there's a
[70:16] variety now I think where we're starting
[70:18] to see countries pay attention and
[70:21] countries actually actively doing
[70:22] something about it I think what you you
[70:25] will see however the US is actually
[70:28] moving quicker I think than than I
[70:30] expected um and moving quicker than
[70:33] maybe what a lot of other people
[70:34] expected to um but we have to also
[70:37] appreciate that governments around the
[70:39] world no matter the size they are
[70:42] generally all still slow and steady to
[70:44] bring introduced changes introduce new
[70:46] things um generally it's public money um
[70:50] that they're doing these things with so
[70:51] they have to be very careful in what
[70:52] they're doing and to appease um
[70:55] their residents their citizens um and
[70:59] they need to make sure that they are
[71:00] sensible in some some approach so this
[71:02] is why another reason why you would
[71:03] never go and buy um cardano and XY Z
[71:06] mcoin and and everything else so you
[71:08] would you would look to the sensible one
[71:10] which is is
[71:11] Bitcoin um but they are it won't happen
[71:15] overnight the game theory side of things
[71:16] and that will happen in the long term
[71:18] and it will take years for that to
[71:20] really kick in and play um some of the
[71:23] bigger ones like your Russia your China
[71:26] um us where they may be able to respond
[71:30] and react quicker because they are
[71:31] trying to compete head-to-head with the
[71:33] US for example with China and Russia
[71:35] they're going to be more head-to-head
[71:36] with the us as opposed to other
[71:38] countries around the world that are not
[71:41] necessarily trying to compete with the
[71:42] US they know they've got to play catchup
[71:44] in some way but they still have to go
[71:45] through their same processes their
[71:47] regulatory hurdles the process is Fally
[71:50] for that com government to bring
[71:52] whatever law it is they require in or
[71:53] whatever process they need to bring in
[71:55] to actually buy Bitcoin um
[71:57] we um here in the alaman um I've been
[72:02] through this funnily enough um the
[72:05] wheels are in motion again for the
[72:06] alaman um but we've had um that's very
[72:11] recent just this week we've just got the
[72:12] wheels in motion again moving um for the
[72:14] Alam man to do something but I've had
[72:17] that same conversation with the treasury
[72:19] Department in the alaman for um every
[72:22] cycle I went back this week looking at
[72:24] my old emails and trying to dig out the
[72:26] dates of where we were for the purpose
[72:28] of this week um I had the conversations
[72:31] in I think it was
[72:32] 2018 uh which was after the 2017 cycle
[72:35] obviously because the interest spiked um
[72:38] that was on them accepting Bitcoin for
[72:40] tax payments Etc and going through that
[72:42] um we then had
[72:44] the conversation with the alaman
[72:47] treasury Department for and that went to
[72:49] their board for the treasury to approve
[72:50] buying Bitcoin in
[72:52] 2021 um so in 2021 they would have been
[72:55] the first country in the world to have
[72:57] bought Bitcoin but um they the decision
[73:01] was a bit of a weird one it wasn't a no
[73:03] which was which was a positive but it
[73:05] wasn't a yes we're going to go and do it
[73:07] straight away it was a it's kind of up
[73:09] to the financial advisory firms that
[73:12] effectively look after the the
[73:14] government's um money uh and
[73:17] unfortunately the criteria doesn't
[73:18] really Bitcoin doesn't really fit in any
[73:19] of their criterias that are allowed to
[73:21] to invest in so they couldn't really do
[73:22] it it was a bit of a a get out for them
[73:24] in some respects unfortunately um now
[73:27] we're now starting the wheels in motion
[73:28] again now off the back of the US
[73:31] strategic Reserve so now they are now
[73:34] open again it's 2025 the cycle it feels
[73:37] like every cycle we basically going to
[73:39] have another conversation with them and
[73:40] we're getting closer and closer each
[73:41] time and the US strategic Reserve has
[73:43] probably allowed us to go that little
[73:45] bit closer this time for the alaman the
[73:48] alaman are a very small
[73:49] jurisdiction very small country um but
[73:52] it's good to obviously for people to
[73:54] know and be aware as well that even the
[73:55] smaller players like the likes of the
[73:57] alaman um they are paying attention they
[74:00] are looking to the US seeing the US
[74:03] doing these things and thinking okay we
[74:05] need to do something as well so that is
[74:07] happening Wheels in Motion um we'll
[74:10] we'll see where we get to it's probably
[74:13] a similar thing of uh when you see a
[74:16] public a huge publicly traded company
[74:19] this inspires a lot of smaller private
[74:21] companies and if you see America slowly
[74:24] moving towards that
[74:25] all of a sudden there's uh tens of other
[74:29] smaller countries that all of a sudden
[74:31] have those conversations and say like
[74:33] hey like why aren't we doing that that
[74:36] if America is moving that we are a
[74:38] smaller country maybe we should move
[74:40] faster than the than the big fish
[74:42] because we we have to do something so in
[74:45] that regard even as as as you said it
[74:49] surprised me also how how quick actually
[74:51] America moved there um we have one
[74:53] question that I asked each and one of my
[74:55] guests and the question is what can we
[74:57] learn from you besides Bitcoin um that's
[75:01] a good
[75:02] question very good question
[75:06] um I guess one of the things it
[75:09] unfortunately will tie into Bitcoin a
[75:10] little bit so I'm I'm maybe more from a
[75:14] business perspective um bootstrapping a
[75:17] business is effectively what we've done
[75:20] over the years we haven't gone to Big
[75:21] Venture Capital Money um to
[75:23] bootstrapping a business
[75:25] over a 10-y year period um is probably
[75:29] something to I couldn't give you too
[75:32] many tips and hints and and things to to
[75:34] learn from on the spot here but maybe to
[75:37] observe what we did at coin corner and
[75:39] how we we did that um there's many
[75:43] companies over the years you've got
[75:45] obviously your coinbase and your binance
[75:46] Etc the coinbase um you know the you've
[75:49] seen the amount of investment they've
[75:50] taken from vure Capital companies over
[75:52] the years and they've thrown money at at
[75:53] the don't say it throw money the problem
[75:55] as such but they've thrown money to grow
[75:57] um grown quickly and that's that's one
[76:00] way of growing but you see in the
[76:02] Venture Capital world I think they
[76:04] usually have their stats where you know
[76:05] every 10 Investments they make one is
[76:07] successful two or three might be like
[76:09] mediocre but not really doing anything
[76:11] and the rest of them fail and they all
[76:12] fail very quickly and go quickly and
[76:13] we've seen that come and go over the
[76:15] years we've seen um many businesses come
[76:17] and go very very
[76:19] quickly um and what we did instead was
[76:23] kind of rather than try and throw money
[76:26] at the problem and trying to create or
[76:28] trying to create a solution in some
[76:30] respects we took a step back and said
[76:32] okay we need to make a real business
[76:33] model here so even at the times when you
[76:37] saw it mostly in the bare markets where
[76:39] a lot of these bigger companies had lots
[76:41] of venture capital money but they
[76:42] weren't getting customers so they had to
[76:43] try and improve their numbers to then
[76:45] raise their next round of funding and
[76:47] they were doing this by spending the
[76:49] money they had to get as much as they
[76:51] could in but they were doing things like
[76:53] offering zero% trading fees so you
[76:55] didn't actually have to pay or anything
[76:57] and we didn't play them games we we said
[77:00] okay no we need to we don't have that
[77:02] funding we're not going to go and take
[77:04] the Venture Capital money we're going to
[77:05] try and bootstrap and grow ourselves so
[77:06] we have the I guess the control within
[77:08] the company of the direction that we
[77:10] want to go in having said that we also
[77:13] didn't we turned down Venture Capital
[77:14] Money along the way over the years as
[77:15] well because we we did sort of flirt
[77:18] with the idea of it and we went and and
[77:20] pitched at many Venture Capital
[77:21] companies um throughout the years though
[77:24] they always wanted blockchain or um or
[77:26] the tokens or anything else around the
[77:29] hype at the time um and it wasn't the
[77:31] same vision and direction that we were
[77:33] wanted to go so we ended up saying no to
[77:35] that all the way through in the end um
[77:38] but one of the things is we did is we
[77:40] focused on creating a real business
[77:41] model with real fees in with structures
[77:43] in and you will maybe have seen over the
[77:46] years people would be you know saying
[77:49] you know coin corn is more expensive
[77:50] than these other places Etc and it would
[77:52] be um and sometimes we were more
[77:53] expensive and that that was was just the
[77:55] case because we' created a real business
[77:56] model that was sustainable and could
[77:58] survive over the long term and looking
[77:59] at the Long play um as opposed to
[78:02] looking at the shortterm benefits where
[78:04] you'll still see in in bare markets U I
[78:06] think actually even binance at the
[78:08] minute they've just reduced their fees
[78:09] to z% for new customers I think or
[78:11] something like that so that's a prime
[78:13] example there of the crypto retail is
[78:15] not here and they're trying to gain more
[78:17] customers to increase their numbers and
[78:19] and sort of bring people in and by doing
[78:21] that they've got they've just raised 2.5
[78:23] billion something or 2 billion from um
[78:26] the ABW one wealth funds again um and
[78:30] they've got the cash and they don't need
[78:32] the fees so they've reduced the fees and
[78:34] that's not a long-term sustainable
[78:35] business model having 0% fees so
[78:39] definitely when starting a business um
[78:41] making sure that you actually create a
[78:44] business model that is sustainable in
[78:46] the long term um and don't always look
[78:49] and focus on what the competitors are
[78:51] doing keep an eye on the competitors and
[78:53] always analyze competitors but don't
[78:55] follow what they're doing because it
[78:56] doesn't mean to say they're doing it
[78:58] right and correct they're doing what
[79:00] they think is correct for them at that
[79:02] particular time um which may turn out to
[79:04] not be correct as well um and it doesn't
[79:06] mean to say they know better than you
[79:08] guys do in your own business so um when
[79:10] running the business always make sure
[79:13] you're the one that that knows your
[79:14] business the best um and hopefully knows
[79:17] the industry well um and make sure you
[79:19] don't um give into peer pressure of
[79:22] competitors doing things that they do
[79:25] from a marketing or whatever reasoning
[79:28] they have behind the scenes of why
[79:29] they're doing them things um make sure
[79:31] you stick to your business model into
[79:33] your
[79:34] direction I think that's that's really
[79:36] cool and uh
[79:39] um almost second episode that we we
[79:43] could start here uh but let's let's keep
[79:45] that for the second round um for to to
[79:49] not make it even longer um we have end
[79:53] in the podcast where the previous guest
[79:54] is asking a question for the next guest
[79:56] without knowing who the next guest
[79:58] actually is uh it's an it's a it's a
[80:00] question that actually never came up but
[80:01] it's a very interesting one um if you
[80:05] could bet if you could make the best
[80:08] case against Bitcoin what would it
[80:11] be
[80:13] um oh good question on the spot it's a
[80:15] good question um the obvious one I guess
[80:20] is hly it's not a good case I would say
[80:24] but it's always the obvious one that a
[80:25] lot of people go to in terms of um
[80:29] satachi and sat's coins and the amount
[80:31] of coins he holds
[80:34] that it's the thing of it's not just
[80:37] because he owns a million Bitcoin or we
[80:38] believe he owns a million Bitcoin um and
[80:40] similarly with micro strategy and they
[80:42] own coming up to 500,000 Bitcoin I
[80:45] believe now um people are thinking okay
[80:48] that's centralized in the respect of um
[80:51] somebody owns loads of these Bitcoin
[80:52] doesn't mean they can control Bitcoin or
[80:54] they can do anything anything to the
[80:55] network to the mining to the ASR Etc um
[80:57] or to the nodes around the world they
[80:58] just hold a lot of this this this
[81:00] currency but however that will and can
[81:03] have an impact and micro strategy is one
[81:05] that people will and already are paying
[81:07] attention to um in the short to medium
[81:09] term if anything goes wrong with micro
[81:11] strategy and they have to liquidate and
[81:12] sell their Bitcoins um they have a lot
[81:15] of Bitcoin that would have to hit the
[81:16] market which would um cause an impact to
[81:19] the price um which causes it doesn't
[81:22] break Bitcoin and the fundamentals of
[81:23] what Bitcoin is and how that works at
[81:25] all so it's not an issue from a survival
[81:28] of Bitcoin however it is an issue in
[81:31] terms of the price that may drop and
[81:34] potentially a fast pace and a large pace
[81:35] for example um and that price drop hits
[81:39] the public and the retail and the public
[81:41] perception of Bitcoin and bitcoin's
[81:43] death again and we've seen this every
[81:45] single cycle there's always some trigger
[81:46] point that creates the bare Market or
[81:48] kicks the bare Market off we had Celsius
[81:50] and FTX Etc last one and um I can't
[81:53] remember the previous ones before that
[81:55] but the there's the trigger point and
[81:57] that always has this public perception
[81:59] which is always negative and that
[82:01] creates um a problem for companies like
[82:03] us where we have to go back out and
[82:05] educate and re-educate it doesn't change
[82:06] the fundamentals so it's not an issue on
[82:08] a fundamental perspective but it is an
[82:10] issue on the public perception and the
[82:12] confidence in Bitcoin from the wider
[82:14] audience um so I do think that's a
[82:16] sensible argument in some respects the
[82:19] the best one I've heard is is with
[82:21] Mining centralization and and the the
[82:23] templates and and and how the pools are
[82:26] uh um kind of big and controll but even
[82:29] that is is is is not good and there are
[82:31] a lot of Solutions in in the works and
[82:33] it's still to to decentralize so like
[82:35] making a case against Bitcoin
[82:37] is is hard difficult yeah ocean mining
[82:42] is a perfect example ocean mining doing
[82:43] with the templates and you can use your
[82:45] so there are solutions coming in but
[82:48] technolog is new technology takes time
[82:50] to grow and to be um integrated and that
[82:53] will take time but there's solution in
[82:55] place and starting to roll out so um
[82:57] yeah I think it's a difficult one to
[82:58] make a a good case against Bitcoin now
[83:01] absolutely and and that that's why we
[83:03] make the case for for Bitcoin uh thank
[83:07] you so much Danny for for being on the
