[00:00] when we were kids the opportunities that
[00:02] we had were almost nothing I received a
[00:05] message from John and he say Joe if I
[00:07] was you I I will watch the conference at
[00:10] this time I went to watch the conference
[00:11] and I see a dream a dream that come true
[00:14] not just for us but for many people I
[00:17] think it have been one of the moment one
[00:19] of the most exciting moment in lives
[00:22] that they we cry you know we cried that
[00:24] some one idea one dream that I was
[00:28] started like really small because true
[00:30] is a good moment to go and get involved
[00:33] and investing now if you're a bitcoiner
[00:35] I think you got a see s you got to
[00:37] comeon
[00:38] jerk I have already had a lot of people
[00:42] from Salvador on like I covered Salvador
[00:45] I covered Bitcoin Berlin I covered the
[00:48] the the hardware store from from from El
[00:51] Salvador like a lot of different angles
[00:54] of Salvador uh but you are from Bitcoin
[00:57] Beach and I actually never had anyone on
[01:00] from Bitcoin Beach and for me it's like
[01:02] Bitcoin Beach is like this this origin
[01:04] story of all the crazy and and good
[01:06] things that are happening now in
[01:08] Salvador um so let's let's talk a little
[01:10] bit before uh uh we get into Bitcoin
[01:14] about Bitcoin Beach uh because I think
[01:17] most of the people know about it but
[01:20] some might not be familiar with it like
[01:23] what is bitcoin Beach and how did this
[01:25] all get started and how are you
[01:26] personally involved in in Bitcoin Beach
[01:31] yeah ER Bitcoin Beach is a it's a it's
[01:38] born in
[01:40] 2019 ER we're a group of people you know
[01:44] some people know me and some people know
[01:46] Mike Peterson some people know
[01:49] Sparky and before and we are we are kids
[01:57] that born in a Sante here in in s that
[02:00] no now this place is known as Bitcoin
[02:03] Beach you know and so we BN here and we
[02:10] see it that when we were kids the the
[02:14] opportunities that we had were almost
[02:17] nothing know it was this dream that you
[02:20] want if you want to have success in life
[02:22] you need to read it you need to leave
[02:24] this this place because even if
[02:27] something was I some tourism back in the
[02:31] years but they were more shers more
[02:34] Backpackers you know or something it
[02:37] used to be a fisherman town a small
[02:39] fisherman town and where a lot like many
[02:45] of the rich families friend instance s
[02:47] used to have their second home like a
[02:50] home where they used to come in the on
[02:52] the weekend
[02:55] and that's how we grew up here you know
[02:58] or uh my father was a fisherman my
[03:02] grandfather was a fisherman and my
[03:04] grandfather was partaker you know most
[03:07] the family here in s or proper here L
[03:11] but they were the Cent take care take
[03:14] care when the fam is were not here you
[03:16] know and it was simple but good life
[03:20] because uh the owners used to come on
[03:22] the weekend and and and you got enjoy
[03:25] like Bas week right I was like perfect
[03:30] that was one of the biggest
[03:31] opportunities that a lot of families
[03:33] were
[03:34] looking being a CRI teer know you know
[03:38] pay for living and they give you a
[03:40] salary
[03:43] and you know being a c taker they they
[03:47] build you like a small house you know
[03:50] but you're living in the sometime in the
[03:51] bu property right FR each right so that
[03:55] was how we we were up here and and we
[04:00] were seeing that the dream was to leave
[04:04] this place because we were thinking that
[04:06] this place have not opportunities for us
[04:10] and I was not hope and didn't see our
[04:13] future here and in this
[04:16] process we start having like people that
[04:20] time in of life you know that change of
[04:24] Chang Your Life Time talked to us but
[04:28] talking about uh different ways of
[04:30] seeing lives talking people that you
[04:33] know were coming from California looking
[04:35] for good wave because that's something
[04:37] that we we have here suring speak El
[04:42] have like some of the that's wave
[04:45] Sabbath gra surfing and people you know
[04:49] traveling all the way here to Surf and
[04:52] one of those people is Mike Peterson he
[04:55] came like 17 years ago 18 years ago in a
[04:58] surf trip
[05:00] and a missionary trip too and he fall in
[05:05] love with this place you know and he
[05:06] decid
[05:07] to home here 70 years ago
[05:12] and he was one of the person that put
[05:15] time in know life that he Happ been that
[05:20] he he was one of the person that
[05:21] believed in this community before that
[05:23] he see the PO of this small town and
[05:29] you know
[05:31] and start he start putting time in our
[05:35] life right he come or
[05:39] Mentor leer or you know one of these
[05:42] families that was teaching us about
[05:46] about life right and in that process
[05:49] where kids were driven to live and and
[05:54] dreaming just to you know live this this
[05:57] this St is where was start working
[06:00] together as BR
[06:03] to kind of lead the kids in in another
[06:07] TR kind of teaching them about
[06:10] dreams about because this is the reality
[06:14] Rob be like a lot of people just say ah
[06:16] don't leave you know fighting for your
[06:18] dreams you can do it but that's easier
[06:21] to say but I really like no one teaching
[06:23] us how to do it no one give us the it
[06:28] the tunes knowledge line to follow right
[06:32] so in that process we we understanding
[06:35] that if we want to make changes on the
[06:38] kids here and they if we want that they
[06:41] start training to leave we gotta provide
[06:43] them these tools and knowledge and
[06:46] that's where we start the project you
[06:48] know teaching them values getting
[06:51] together with that for surfing very
[06:54] teaching them English classes teaching
[06:56] them computers computer skills and just
[06:59] spending having the having quanity
[07:03] time and that was the that was the
[07:05] project you know that we were doing as a
[07:09] team
[07:11] and that was that was really good you
[07:14] know because we already we already
[07:17] seen the local kids getting like better
[07:22] in English you know better computer
[07:25] skills and they start to work hotels you
[07:28] know work
[07:30] BRS being Sur structor getting more
[07:33] involved with the with the tourism that
[07:36] you know was starting
[07:38] like and but now we connecting that we
[07:43] were missing something right and and in
[07:48] 2019 ER our project it came from more
[07:52] than 10 years right that we have been
[07:55] working trying
[07:57] to give it back to the kids some of the
[08:01] help that we receive you know trying to
[08:03] replicate what these people like Mike
[08:06] Peterson like Alex right just to mention
[08:10] that some of the names of people that
[08:12] find in our in our life right we we
[08:16] start working with the kids here
[08:19] and but in
[08:21] 2019 someone approached
[08:24] Mike ER with the asking him for help you
[08:28] know to
[08:31] they were another organization that they
[08:33] receive a big condemnation but they
[08:35] don't know what to do with with that
[08:37] delion and at time in 2018 my was
[08:43] already he already get it
[08:46] and he helped
[08:49] them and then they they they asked him
[08:53] if he will be interesting to meeting
[08:55] with the person that was the needed to
[08:57] that and see if they if this person be
[09:01] interesting on supporting the projects
[09:03] that we were doing here in Salvador and
[09:07] he attending this meeting with this
[09:10] person and you know this
[09:15] person was not the donor was someone
[09:18] that was representing the donor I had
[09:22] this
[09:23] version met with Mike and and
[09:27] request like okay okay we help you know
[09:30] like projects nonprofit organizations so
[09:34] if we will decide to support you guys
[09:37] what would you do with these donations
[09:40] know and mighte explain all the projects
[09:41] that we were doing the classers that we
[09:44] were in small town in sber that he was
[09:48] you know like we were teaching computer
[09:50] skills we have scholarship for college
[09:53] and this guy requests like okay send me
[09:55] a proposal what what you guys will do
[09:58] with bitco
[09:59] we support see if we support your
[10:02] project so that the same day might write
[10:07] a letter right that explaining what we
[10:10] were doing and how we will use the
[10:12] Bitcoin you know how we
[10:15] will create
[10:18] this circle economy you know now now
[10:22] everyone talk about bitco Circle
[10:24] economies but before that concept
[10:28] doesn't exist right what is a bit
[10:30] economy so in the letter he explained
[10:34] what we would do with Bitcoin to pray
[10:37] that the nation that we receive that be
[10:40] circulate into the economy and creating
[10:44] into the community and creating
[10:47] that like a like a like a local market
[10:52] you know like where we will teach people
[10:56] how to use Bitcoin right and and so that
[11:01] letter you can read it because later in
[11:04] the years now we create the Bitcoin
[11:07] Beach white paper that is basically
[11:10] align that basically line how we did and
[11:13] is that white paper have beening other
[11:16] projects to replicate we create you know
[11:20] it's it's called a bit and white paper
[11:22] you can s up do man is in itop you can
[11:26] go to the Beacon Beach a beach on
[11:29] Twitter and there is the first tweet
[11:31] that is beenin in there and you and I
[11:33] know that there and you can read that
[11:36] that first letter is there and then we
[11:38] develop all the concept into uh uh
[11:42] Bitcoin Beach white paper right the
[11:43] Bitcoin Beach white paper we
[11:46] created as a guideline to that other
[11:51] other communities other leaders that
[11:53] were inspired about the success of we
[11:58] can be and being interesting on
[12:01] replicating like an initiative a similar
[12:04] initiative so we create this document
[12:06] that is open source that everyone can
[12:09] read it and basically it's a catalog you
[12:11] know it's like Bitcoin the white paper
[12:13] is but you can apply to your own reality
[12:17] your own country to your own environment
[12:21] you but like I say in 2019 we were
[12:25] rewarding the the kids you know we were
[12:29] when we received the first the the
[12:31] donation in Bitcoin we were finding ways
[12:34] to create something that now we know as
[12:38] a bitco economy but back in the days
[12:41] that concept it didn't exist you know we
[12:44] developing we created what is a big cons
[12:47] economy how how how that look like you
[12:51] know and the beginning was you know we
[12:56] had projects with kids so we were
[12:58] rewarding the students for being good
[13:00] students rewarding the kids for King the
[13:03] beach King the the river and they get
[13:07] rewards in Bitcoin and that was one
[13:09] place where in 2019 in in El that is
[13:13] called Mama Rosa when you come we will
[13:16] go to who there because that was the
[13:19] first place in h salador to that was
[13:23] aecting bit Bitcoin payments you know so
[13:27] the students the people that
[13:29] were working in the project that start
[13:32] to receiving their salaries in Bitcoin
[13:35] you know they were to Mama Rosa to buy
[13:37] kusas to have lunch to buy their basic
[13:40] needed right in in bit and Mama Rosa was
[13:44] the Mama Rosa is the J's mother so hor
[13:48] is one of the founder of Bitcoin Beach
[13:50] and po house so it was let's say m Rosa
[13:54] trust TR us and Trust harder right so
[13:59] um but we were you know 2019 was a
[14:04] really exciting year for for us because
[14:09] we had that year we
[14:12] had
[14:14] another to the whole package that we
[14:17] were trying to teach to the kids right
[14:21] and that thing it was something that no
[14:24] one teaching you around the world there
[14:26] is financial issue you know no no one
[14:29] teaching you even in German even United
[14:33] State in Canada you know no one teaching
[14:36] us what money is have money words what
[14:39] is money you know those simple question
[14:42] that are super simple but I think for
[14:45] most of the bitcoiners now one of the
[14:48] thing the most important thing that
[14:50] people brought brought to us is to
[14:53] understand money and start having
[14:55] question
[14:56] about so to 2019 was that year that we
[15:02] started developing you know using B in
[15:04] our projects baying English classes B
[15:07] families that were working in the
[15:09] project having Mama Rosa second B
[15:12] payments you know so that article that
[15:14] was right by force in 2020 by
[15:17] taana uh it was explaining what was
[15:21] happening in this small town in alab
[15:23] right it was
[15:25] like it was like this little town in is
[15:29] using Bitcoin in a daily base right
[15:32] they're creating the first Bitcoin Circ
[15:34] economy and that was in
[15:36] 2020 and when the article went out from
[15:40] Forbes you know forbs Forbes Magazine it
[15:44] was huge like I remember the the article
[15:48] was publishing let's say today and the
[15:51] next day we
[15:54] had well first people were calling you
[15:58] know like some friend that we working in
[15:59] Banks and finance here in the country
[16:02] they're like is this is true it's
[16:04] happening in Sante you know like it's
[16:07] happening is this is this article is
[16:09] real or yeah it's real you should come
[16:12] and check it out you know and the next
[16:14] day Rob after that article we start to
[16:17] having news and local news from the
[16:20] mayor like TV channels here from NOAB
[16:24] knocking in the door and saying like hey
[16:26] where is Bitcoin Beach where's running
[16:28] Bitcoin Beach you know what's happening
[16:30] why forbs is writing about this and and
[16:33] from there it
[16:35] went B right like we start to
[16:39] having like people
[16:42] from all over the world coming here to
[16:46] see what was happening here you know we
[16:49] start having like people like Jack MERS
[16:53] came Jack MERS came in in
[16:57] 2021 but my mil Suter came to Nicolas
[17:01] game that Nicolas is the founder of
[17:05] galloy he built he built like a small
[17:08] wallet for us that was called Bitcoin
[17:11] Beach wallet now it's blink and now
[17:14] blink it's become a a wallet a compan is
[17:18] one of the
[17:19] most successful lining wallet that
[17:22] exists around the world right but it was
[17:25] it was created with thinking for this
[17:27] small community right but
[17:29] I I think from
[17:31] there is where you everyone have been
[17:36] hearing right that Bitcoin Beach was the
[17:39] first Bitcoin Circle economy
[17:42] and 2001 well 2020 was a big year of
[17:48] seeing all this potential and this
[17:50] excitement and these people from all
[17:52] over the world trou here coming and it
[17:56] get crazy in 2020 21 when the president
[18:00] announced in in the conference in Miami
[18:03] that Bitcoin will be legal tender here
[18:06] after that the next
[18:10] day people fly out from Miami to come
[18:13] toab and see the first B country or see
[18:17] of s and and asking like what can I do
[18:21] I'm excited I I have been dreaming for
[18:24] this for years you know because I think
[18:26] that is the that is the reality you know
[18:29] when the president make Bitcoin a legal
[18:30] tender here it g it make it make that
[18:34] dream for many people right not just for
[18:37] for us but that dream that one day you
[18:40] will be the first biton country and now
[18:44] here we are you know here we are in
[18:46] Bitcoin country Bitcoin is a legal
[18:48] tender Bitcoin is you can come here and
[18:51] live in the Bitcoin Stander that was
[18:54] like it even sounds surreal right is
[18:59] people don't imagine you know and every
[19:02] week every day here we have a new people
[19:04] that come exciting right I've been
[19:07] waiting to come to Sab because I I want
[19:10] to spend Bitcoin I want to see how that
[19:13] feel you know I want to see my first I
[19:15] want to do my first Ling transaction and
[19:19] that have been n nonstop man since
[19:23] 20
[19:27] 2021 it's
[19:29] it have been a big process here how how
[19:32] was it when Jak malas came down because
[19:34] I think Jak malas was really uh
[19:36] essential essential for then also
[19:39] meeting with the president n buuk and
[19:42] then like announcing it also on stage in
[19:44] the Bitcoin conference uh like was it
[19:48] apparent when ja males came the first
[19:51] times uh that something big is happening
[19:54] uh or was it just like oh there he wants
[19:56] to build an app for for for lightning
[19:59] transactions or like how was how was it
[20:01] when Jack mares came to bitcoin Beach
[20:04] Jack came to to Jack and spend time with
[20:07] us a Bitcoin Beach right with any any
[20:10] expectation you know he came and I think
[20:14] he was surprised about what was
[20:18] happening here you know and you know
[20:21] when you build something that that
[20:24] happened a lot to the programmers or the
[20:27] engineers or of developers you know that
[20:30] they build something but most of the
[20:33] time they don't see the result how
[20:35] people use it you know but I think he
[20:38] was like chocked about
[20:41] how a small
[20:44] community was transforming and was
[20:47] having access for the first time and see
[20:50] that hope and people and see that
[20:53] potential that a Sante was providing and
[20:58] was showing
[20:59] to the rest of the country but also like
[21:02] that excitement for the rest of the
[21:04] world right that one Community can can
[21:07] can start a like really small dreaming
[21:11] big right and I think that was crucial
[21:17] we spent a lot of time with with J
[21:19] talking about process talking about the
[21:23] opportunities talking about you know
[21:26] that that that the same problem that we
[21:30] were facing here in alante was the same
[21:32] problem that exist in now in in the in
[21:35] the country you know the country had if
[21:37] we would had 90% of people on bank
[21:40] without a bank account well so in entire
[21:43] country had 70%
[21:47] of that that didn't have a bank you know
[21:52] so Jack show that that example that was
[21:55] set up here why we don't try to bring it
[22:00] to the whole country you know and Jack
[22:04] is is for me is one of my favorite
[22:08] bitcoiner one of the person that I I
[22:11] admire a lot
[22:14] and and he's he's he's here for Bitcoin
[22:18] right he's here for the for the mission
[22:21] he's he's you know he have a successful
[22:24] company strike a strike at the time was
[22:26] not this big company you know but he he
[22:30] came and I think he was interesting to
[22:33] opening other markets at the
[22:35] time and to launch an strike in other
[22:40] countries but he came here and he said
[22:43] wait a minute I have been building this
[22:45] up for these people to give access to
[22:49] people that didn't have access this is
[22:52] this is what strike is right this is why
[22:55] the purpose of strike that's that's
[22:57] that's what he saying he like it didn't
[22:59] make sense that to strike focus in
[23:01] another countries when this is the
[23:03] country that I should focus and set up
[23:05] the example from here for the rest of
[23:07] the world and he's like strike his lanon
[23:10] in here you know he he did the the
[23:12] announc it over over after a couple
[23:16] months he was here
[23:18] and with us he like well we're gonna
[23:22] launch at strike here and he did this
[23:24] big announcement on on on Twitter and he
[23:27] went vital like you were like that's
[23:29] good you know that's that's what we need
[23:32] and and everyone crazy and and he and it
[23:37] was you know I
[23:39] remember I remember Jack
[23:43] saying saying
[23:45] like well if if we can get like 5,000
[23:50] user in one month you know in two months
[23:53] we will be happy but it's it went crazy
[23:57] right strikes start to get get like
[23:59] 20,000 users 30,000 users 40,000 users
[24:03] you know I went crazy man and and it was
[24:08] ah it was a good moment you know and
[24:11] everyone was talking about strike
[24:14] elapor and and then we all know what he
[24:17] explained you know he get contact by one
[24:20] of the brother of the president and say
[24:22] hey come we need to talk you know and
[24:25] and and I think
[24:29] that was crucial right jack helped to
[24:32] accelerate something that it could
[24:35] happen later in years later in town but
[24:39] he he he was key
[24:43] on you know accelerate that process and
[24:48] and I think president is a
[24:51] Visionary leader that can see the
[24:54] potential and they working together in
[24:57] in 19 you know they did the announce it
[25:01] but it was crazy that moment that moment
[25:04] Robbie that day I was not watching the
[25:08] conference Mike Mike was at the
[25:09] conference but I was not watching the
[25:12] conference I was doing another thing and
[25:15] I I received a message from from Jack
[25:19] and he say Joe if I was you I I will
[25:23] watch the conference at this time and
[25:25] goinging on stage at this time and he
[25:28] just said say I hope she I I hope I make
[25:30] you
[25:31] proud I and I went to watch the
[25:34] conference right I went to watch the
[25:36] conference and I see like you know a
[25:40] dream a dream that comes true not just
[25:42] for us but for many people I think it
[25:46] have been one of the moment one of the
[25:49] most exciting moment in lives that they
[25:52] we cry you know we cry that
[25:55] some one idea one dream
[25:59] that was started like really small
[26:01] become true
[26:03] and the jersey that Jack used that day
[26:07] the the alab Jersey I give it to him
[26:10] because me and Jack we make the this the
[26:13] birthday in the same day so I give it to
[26:16] him and and that that year that year J
[26:21] was here 2021 he was here in April and
[26:26] we celebrate together the birthday you
[26:28] know my friends buy two cakes we make a
[26:31] big barbecue and you know good moments I
[26:35] think uh that those are going to be like
[26:37] moments to remember right for for life
[26:42] if you are listening to this podcast you
[26:44] might be wondering what is actually the
[26:46] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[26:48] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[26:51] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[26:53] right source and you have to store
[26:55] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[26:57] first thing how do to buy Bitcoin it's
[26:59] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[27:02] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[27:04] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[27:05] own token or something like that be on a
[27:08] Bitcoin only exchange I use 21 Bitcoin
[27:11] 21 Bitcoin is for me the best partner
[27:14] for that and now where do you store
[27:16] Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a
[27:18] hardware wallet on a self custody
[27:21] solution where you yourself hold your
[27:24] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[27:27] that's My Simple Solutions that's a
[27:30] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[27:32] there back up your seed fras and you are
[27:35] better than
[27:36] 95% of all Bitcoin holders if you have
[27:39] more than ,000 in Bitcoin it's a
[27:42] absolutely must have one last thing
[27:44] before we get back to the video I'm
[27:46] really passionate about meeting other
[27:48] bitcoiners and there's an amazing
[27:50] opportunity in middle of Europe in June
[27:53] the Bitcoin Brock conference it's the
[27:56] best and biggest Bitcoin only conference
[27:59] in whole of Europe for all Americans
[28:01] please visit Europe and visit this place
[28:04] in June for all europes it's a must go
[28:07] anyways you're so close to the Bitcoin
[28:09] PR conference you basically have to come
[28:11] I will do interviews there and I would
[28:13] love to meet you all there use code
[28:16] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[28:19] discounts and use the links down in the
[28:21] description that's amazing I I love the
[28:24] story so much uh and you also talked
[28:26] about financial uh education where you
[28:29] like brought in uh those projects about
[28:31] financial education and Bitcoin
[28:33] education with the kids um are there are
[28:36] like now programs in place I heard a
[28:39] little bit of programs that are now
[28:41] explaining to the new generation Bitcoin
[28:44] uh to the new generation Financial
[28:45] education uh is those are those like
[28:48] private uh uh things or is this like
[28:50] maybe like a school program from
[28:53] Salvador I is like the because I think
[28:56] if you want to make a really great
[28:58] impact in the country long term uh you
[29:01] have to like really um get the education
[29:05] going for the new generation like even
[29:07] gen education for everybody right now
[29:10] there but especially for the younger
[29:12] generation that they are as you said in
[29:14] Germany in in Austria there is no
[29:17] Financial education as in everyone
[29:20] everywhere in the world but it would be
[29:22] a great step for Salvador uh to like
[29:25] establish Financial education Bitcoin
[29:27] education
[29:28] uh like really uh soon that are there
[29:30] some some projects that also in Bitcoin
[29:32] Beach and or like in the in the country
[29:35] yes yes a lot of people I think we all
[29:39] agree that education key right is is is
[29:42] is the key to success educating people
[29:45] you
[29:46] know once you understand Bitcoin you
[29:49] think it easier for people to understand
[29:51] in that the the reality is that most of
[29:55] the people it took time to get it right
[29:58] if you
[29:59] choose I don't know like a random Now
[30:02] understand Bitcoin you say like hey how
[30:04] long it took you to from the first time
[30:06] that you here for the first time Bitcoin
[30:09] about Bitcoin until you're really
[30:11] understanding and you purchase your
[30:14] first s it's like a few people will say
[30:17] ah no I hear about Bitcoin today and in
[30:19] a week I was buying Bitcoin you know
[30:22] mosts of the people hear about bit and
[30:24] then be years until they say like oh I
[30:28] really get it you know and now I'm
[30:31] buying bitco why I I understand it right
[30:34] so
[30:35] salbador you need to understanding that
[30:39] Bitcoin just become a legal tender a
[30:41] little bit more than two years now the
[30:44] September were are going to be three
[30:46] three years and most of the people hear
[30:50] about
[30:51] Bitcoin from that you know and if you
[30:56] come to places like Bitcoin Beach and
[30:59] you see oh hear people understanding
[31:02] more about Bitcoin yes because we are a
[31:05] little be early
[31:08] into into that but eventually it just
[31:11] timing the timing will will solve them
[31:15] this this this this problem right this
[31:18] process but a good thing now is that
[31:23] there are there are so many initiative
[31:26] now one of the biggest initiative that
[31:29] have been not having a lot of traction
[31:32] is one of the projects that ER we are
[31:36] working
[31:38] with the minister of
[31:41] Education the yeah the minister the
[31:45] Ministry of Education my first Bitcoin
[31:48] and Bitcoin Beach were working H
[31:52] together to
[31:54] training public teachers from the public
[31:58] schools about Bitcoin and then these
[32:01] these teachers will back to their school
[32:05] and training students you know and we
[32:09] did the first pilot last year we
[32:11] training 150 teachers from the public
[32:14] school and then they went back to their
[32:18] school and they they training around I
[32:22] think 2,500
[32:24] students and this year we just start
[32:28] with the first SE like a couple weeks
[32:30] three weeks ago that this year we're
[32:33] going to
[32:34] training 500 almost 600 teachers from
[32:39] the public schools and these teachers
[32:42] will back to their schools and they will
[32:44] training around 18,000 students from the
[32:48] public from the public schools you know
[32:51] so this is huge you know and then
[32:54] separately to this there are great
[32:57] initiative like my first Bitcoin they
[33:00] focus in a daily basis on bitcoin
[33:03] education then there is not mentions
[33:06] that there is another project that
[33:07] they're they they're working also with
[33:09] the Ministry of Education to install it
[33:13] notes lighning notes in public schools
[33:16] and training students in the more with
[33:19] more Tech
[33:20] skills um yeah Tech skills you know and
[33:25] then there are there are like taros
[33:28] there is go plus there is another great
[33:31] initiative more who is more Tech you
[33:35] know like they're training like local
[33:38] developers there is Kua plus man we
[33:41] should see
[33:43] this these
[33:45] guys Stacy the biton office Stacy Stacy
[33:50] and Max they have been really involing
[33:53] on that and they training last year the
[33:56] first group of
[33:58] Salvadorian developers you know and and
[34:01] that was huge and if you see those kids
[34:06] or they're not kids they're like young
[34:08] guys right 20s 22 23 25 and we're some
[34:14] on they're olders but man it's crazy
[34:17] what they're doing now and see
[34:20] their teex skills that they're getting
[34:23] some of them they're already working
[34:25] some of them they're doing
[34:28] and internship with some companies
[34:31] Bitcoin companies you know and I think
[34:34] it's it's just
[34:36] exciting what have been what have been
[34:40] accomplishing in just two years you know
[34:43] and not just in education right
[34:46] education
[34:48] is it's where we need to focus and and
[34:52] every day there are new people or new
[34:56] companies one of the things that I
[34:59] also um you know get I admire and I get
[35:04] surprised I will
[35:06] never imagine man that a sadorian
[35:10] company or sadorian sadorian people will
[35:13] build a Bitcoin company you know or
[35:17] build a Bitcoin uh bu build a company
[35:19] top of Bitcoin technology and start to
[35:22] provideing Solutions Financial solution
[35:25] to not just also like to outside of
[35:30] exporting technology outside of you know
[35:33] and this is like huge you know to see
[35:37] these Salvadorian companies that are
[35:40] working in on bitcoin technology and are
[35:44] getting success and are leading the way
[35:46] you know so you know there are so many
[35:49] great initiative happening uh Robbie and
[35:52] that's
[35:53] why you can have like an overview you
[35:56] know having a sense
[35:58] Twitter what's what's happening but like
[36:01] really like it's you really understand
[36:04] what what what's really happening when
[36:07] you come here you know because every
[36:09] week there are Bitcoin meetups in Sal
[36:11] salador we have meetups here in in in
[36:13] bit Beach there is meetups in Berlin
[36:16] there is project with cool plus there is
[36:21] Volcan there is taros there is so many
[36:24] events every day that
[36:28] you're like so time it's hard to keep up
[36:30] with everything that is happening you so
[36:34] I my my advice to everyone is like I can
[36:37] tell you but sometime it's hard to Sol
[36:39] the IDE of what is happening you you
[36:41] guys need to come and and and bfy you
[36:46] know definitely and I think I encourage
[36:49] everybody even though I did not do it
[36:51] myself I am planning to doing on in
[36:53] November coming to El Salvador and I
[36:56] encourage everybody just visit El
[36:58] Salvador I hear I hear so many great
[37:00] things uh from people that were from El
[37:03] Salvador went out of El Salvador and now
[37:06] came back I hear stories from people
[37:08] that uh were just like living outside
[37:11] they were living in London they were
[37:12] living in Germany but then they decided
[37:14] to come to El Salvador and they stay in
[37:16] El Salvador so there's clearly something
[37:19] really positive and great happening even
[37:22] Beyond uh Bitcoin I think there's
[37:25] something greater happening in there uh
[37:28] and I feel like there's a a storm to bit
[37:31] to El Salvador there like like more and
[37:33] more people want to come to El Salvador
[37:35] or starting the plan to uh El Salvador
[37:38] or visiting El Salvador uh is this
[37:41] noticeable as like you are living in El
[37:43] salvor do you see is do you notice that
[37:46] there are more tourists there are more
[37:48] people uh buying houses there there are
[37:50] more people uh making the shift to
[37:53] making the main residence in El Salvador
[37:55] do you notice that as a a citizen of
[37:59] Salvador yeah no it's it's that that is
[38:03] a that is a good question and I think Al
[38:07] salador is in the map now The Narrative
[38:09] of Al salador is have been changing Al
[38:12] salador like have been changing forever
[38:15] like President say and I I'm agree with
[38:18] you is more bigger than Bitcoin right
[38:20] Bitcoin is is part of this
[38:23] transformation but I think it's also
[38:25] like when you have a great
[38:28] leader h a great leader inspire people
[38:31] to do gr to want to participate you know
[38:36] a great leader is a great leader that
[38:38] provide that open freedom for for the
[38:41] people you know and I think that's what
[38:43] we have here in sa we have a a great
[38:46] leader you know that is doing the right
[38:48] thing for the people and that is in in
[38:51] the whole context right
[38:55] and I think
[38:58] what is this is from the human
[39:02] perspective you know we want to live in
[39:04] a place where we are exciting for the
[39:07] future we want to live in a place where
[39:09] we have hope where we have freedom you
[39:14] know and I think we only need two things
[39:18] hope and freedom and once you have these
[39:21] two things is where you see the magic
[39:23] happen right where you see people
[39:25] dreaming where you see people exciting
[39:28] about the future where you see
[39:30] families ER that want to have kids
[39:34] people that want to have companies
[39:36] people that want to share with other
[39:37] people people that want to help each
[39:39] other you know because there is this
[39:42] whole there is this excitement right and
[39:45] I think this is what's happening here in
[39:48] El
[39:49] Saad it's we have that hope and freedom
[39:53] and that proud we feel proud for the
[39:58] first time in
[39:59] a long time right we feel proud to be
[40:02] Salvadoran we feel proud to be here we
[40:05] feel proud
[40:07] to do our part to contributing you know
[40:10] to help each other right and I think
[40:14] that's what that's what people are
[40:17] looking you know because that freedom
[40:19] and and hope that I'm talking it used to
[40:22] be attached to countries like USA Canada
[40:26] Europe you know and I keep hearing more
[40:31] often that people that are living there
[40:35] they don't feel it any you know that
[40:37] something is changing right and when
[40:39] something is changing People start to
[40:41] looking for places that provide that
[40:44] hope and freedom and they're they're
[40:46] coming here and they're feeling that you
[40:48] know and I think that is it's beautiful
[40:52] that our country is providing that hope
[40:55] and freedom for us but but also that
[40:58] hope for people around the world you
[41:01] know and
[41:02] and you I I I have a real estate company
[41:07] called Good Life with sabad and we have
[41:12] been we we're helping and every week
[41:15] probie we receive I don't know how many
[41:18] emails every week of new people looking
[41:22] for you know like aab represent
[41:26] different things also for different
[41:29] people you know like a lot of of the
[41:33] people they just want
[41:35] to you know having a plan B having a
[41:39] plan B having a a home cheer that they
[41:43] can come and spend six month per year
[41:45] and six months whatever or something
[41:48] happen you know having a p being ready
[41:51] right to to come and Le fulltime or some
[41:55] other people understanding that Al
[41:58] salador is like like a like an startup
[42:02] you know that everything is moving I saw
[42:06] people that used to investing in startup
[42:09] in early stage of companies they're
[42:12] approaching of s in the same way and
[42:14] they're seeing like wait this is a
[42:16] country that is moving that is going in
[42:19] this direction up is a good moment to go
[42:22] and and get involved and investing now
[42:26] in all all type of sectors right now
[42:30] we're seeing tourism booming right real
[42:32] estate is booming here you know and but
[42:36] you also have that that
[42:41] family or that guy that is already
[42:45] retired that get to the point that say I
[42:48] don't want to build another company in
[42:50] the in the United State I don't want to
[42:52] build another company in Europe tie with
[42:54] regulation you know whatever we want do
[42:57] like a lot of things and they come into
[43:00] s to this one a place to come and
[43:02] relaxing and eventually you see this
[43:05] people saying like well I mean I cannot
[43:07] just come and relax here you know I I
[43:10] need to get involved in something and I
[43:12] what are my skills why I don't Ru my
[43:15] company from Canada here why I don't
[43:17] start my the company that I just retire
[43:20] I just sold I have these skills and I
[43:23] can apply in here you know and I can
[43:25] support the locals and reur jobs better
[43:28] pay so it's it's it's a it's an exciting
[43:33] moment that everyone
[43:37] come with not expectation with any idea
[43:42] but everyone leave with a a clear idea
[43:46] of of of what they want to do you know
[43:49] and I think it's it's beautiful you know
[43:52] and something that I we have been
[43:58] have been touching me and it have been
[44:01] changing my mind is when I start to
[44:04] see families living Canada lby to and
[44:09] moving to
[44:11] sabad the families leaving Europe and
[44:15] say
[44:16] hey I wanna I want that my kids grow
[44:21] up in a sabath you know
[44:25] or people coming in Say Hey I want the
[44:28] Salvadorian passport so bad you know I
[44:31] want to support what the government is
[44:33] doing what the Salvador is doing I think
[44:37] that's what you were saying that is more
[44:40] bigger than
[44:41] Bitcoin I think that's
[44:44] exactly what is happening here
[44:48] people people that are coming here they
[44:51] they they they just they don't just want
[44:54] to buy a home here or more their company
[44:57] from Canada to here or from Europe to
[44:59] here but they want to be part of History
[45:02] you know and I think I really believe
[45:05] history is happening here and this
[45:07] example it
[45:09] will show to the rest of the word you
[45:13] know how this country will change
[45:16] because even
[45:18] in short period sa have been changing so
[45:23] much now and it's exciting
[45:27] yeah it's definitely exciting and when
[45:29] we also see like Steps From the Bal with
[45:32] the free passports for skilled people I
[45:34] think it was like 5,000 or something
[45:36] like that uh and so many great steps he
[45:39] took and the biton beach and the whole
[45:41] country took and the initiative uh
[45:44] you're doing is it's just beautiful to
[45:47] to observe that what's going on in
[45:50] Salvador um which leads me to my next
[45:52] question like what what's next for salv
[45:54] like what's what are the the next steps
[45:57] uh in for El Salvador to build on that
[46:00] great uh thing that are were happening
[46:03] over the last like three years which
[46:06] buil an extremely fast development from
[46:09] like okay we have the highest murder
[46:11] rate to one of the lowest murder rates
[46:14] we have booming tourism real estate is
[46:17] booming Bitcoin is doing good uh people
[46:19] want to move here like what's what's
[46:21] what's like the next 10 years looking
[46:23] like for a Salvador just building more
[46:25] and more out is it education
[46:27] is it stuff like from from the bring
[46:31] more skilled people in uh like what what
[46:34] do you think is like in the in the next
[46:37] few years happening for
[46:39] Salvador I don't know man
[46:42] but but definitely definitely the the
[46:46] future
[46:47] looks great and I think everyone is
[46:51] exciting for what is coming right
[46:55] because you know people are talking that
[46:58] asab would be the next Singapore
[47:02] latan or I don't know I think even
[47:06] better because Singapore is not not that
[47:09] beautiful how country is right we have
[47:12] we have everything everything here right
[47:14] from mountains volcanoes Lake ocean
[47:18] Rivers food people perfect weather you
[47:22] know
[47:24] and so I think it's
[47:28] from now on what I see from our small
[47:33] our perspective is that now is the time
[47:37] that we're goingon to see real changes
[47:39] right like on building you know and all
[47:42] the great initiative like s is is
[47:47] attracting the smarter people around the
[47:50] world you know and when I say this you
[47:52] got to see the people that are coming
[47:56] here you know know it's like literally
[47:59] there are the smarter people in the
[48:00] world you know looking on S and seeing
[48:02] like hey I want to see how can I help I
[48:06] want to see how I I'm coming to me
[48:10] to to build to support to create
[48:14] infrastructure you know I
[48:17] don't when I say I don't know because
[48:20] it's hard to imagine right like how it's
[48:23] going to be but definitely it's going to
[48:25] be
[48:27] something that is happening here I think
[48:30] is going to be the example for many
[48:32] places you know and and I really hope
[48:36] this is one of the thing that I really
[48:38] hope that our people
[48:41] here are going to be part of the of
[48:45] these big changes you know and
[48:49] that the lives like level of will will
[48:55] go up and you know
[48:57] and that's what we're seeing now you
[49:00] know like I think there are people that
[49:03] still dreaming to leave the country
[49:05] looking for better
[49:07] opportunities and but that is that is
[49:11] changing you know that is changing a lot
[49:14] right the John people
[49:17] here are dreaming that is possible here
[49:23] and I think when you dream you have a
[49:26] chance right you have a chance that this
[49:29] door the door this small door is
[49:32] open and you have a chance to Mater in
[49:36] life right having dreams having goals
[49:39] it's super important for your personal
[49:42] you know like life you know to have
[49:45] something to wake up every day and and
[49:47] and live your life and give the best you
[49:49] can right but I think elab is dreaming I
[49:53] I I see it that that elab is dreaming
[49:56] and now it's hard to imagine where this
[49:59] dream will be right but is if the whole
[50:02] country is dreaming I think in 10 years
[50:07] we're gonna be in a place that it's
[50:09] gonna be it's gonna be hard to see back
[50:12] and say like wow it's it's crazy you
[50:16] know how far we have been
[50:19] moving
[50:21] and you know see see little country
[50:27] changing and
[50:31] transforming on one of the best
[50:34] countries in the planet
[50:36] right yeah I'm really looking forward to
[50:39] what El Salvador is doing also for other
[50:40] countries because El Salvador is now uh
[50:44] as I think the role model for Global
[50:47] Bitcoin adoption Salvador is testing and
[50:50] trying out a lot of the things that we
[50:52] need all over the world uh and uh when
[50:56] El Salvador is really successful this is
[50:59] good for Bitcoin when Bitcoin is really
[51:01] successful this is really good for El
[51:03] Salvador so it has this really good
[51:06] positive uh synergies that that the
[51:08] Salvador has and I'm I'm really looking
[51:10] forward to what the future for El
[51:12] Salvador and the future for Bitcoin
[51:14] brings in the like next 10 20 years uh
[51:17] because I see a lot of great
[51:19] Partnerships also from El Salvador Other
[51:21] Nation States maybe that want to like
[51:24] partner up and copy what El salvad is
[51:27] doing uh and yeah I'm just like really
[51:31] fascinating to see the whole story
[51:32] playing out and that's why I'm I'm
[51:34] liking so many the the the interviews
[51:36] with salvadorians because you can feel
[51:39] it like when you talk with someone they
[51:42] can talk a lot but you can really feel
[51:44] it in their voice in their guess in
[51:46] their uh their their movements of the
[51:49] body they they're really hopeful and
[51:52] they're positive for the future and this
[51:54] is not just like talking this is
[51:55] actually like something that going on
[51:57] and I think as you said before when you
[52:00] go directly to El Salvador set foot on
[52:02] the ground and actually experience it
[52:05] this will just enhance the feeling even
[52:07] more and then you can feel it then
[52:09] really what's what's happening in
[52:11] Salvador I'm really I'm I I I love
[52:14] what's going on there and I'm I'm just
[52:16] ashamed that I was not there yet but I
[52:19] will be there hopefully this year and
[52:21] I'm I'm looking forward to meeting you
[52:23] there and look look Robbie like you
[52:27] saying I can I can talk from the
[52:31] perspective of being a kid right that
[52:34] born in environment
[52:38] that we didn't see that hope and that
[52:42] exciting about the future and our life
[52:44] was were like tough times right and I
[52:50] see it now from where we were kids and
[52:55] the type of opportunities that we
[52:58] had comparing to now it's huge man so
[53:04] there is another country you know and
[53:07] that is something that
[53:10] is it's s is building the base now
[53:14] that's how I see it building the
[53:17] base building the base is hard building
[53:20] top of the base the foundation this
[53:23] history so I think from now on
[53:27] it's just exciting the time that are
[53:29] coming you know and and you seen from
[53:33] even like Xbox that just moved here one
[53:35] year two years ago and they're they're
[53:40] exciting you know they're like they they
[53:43] they see just in two years that the
[53:45] amounts of changes that they see it's
[53:48] it's huge you know and they cannot see
[53:51] where we ke where we're coming from
[53:53] right they just can't hear and and read
[53:56] but we that we live or we know from
[53:59] where we coming from where we are now is
[54:02] huge you know and it's beautiful to see
[54:04] it
[54:05] so man I think it's definitely I think
[54:09] like you say I something the pro and
[54:12] show that one Community can change using
[54:16] this
[54:17] technology ER and I think s will Pro and
[54:21] show that one country can change too you
[54:24] know using this technology
[54:27] and having like I say the great leader
[54:30] right doing the right thing for the
[54:32] people that's going to be huge you know
[54:37] and I
[54:39] can I can tell you as a
[54:43] Salvadorian hi I'm exciting to live here
[54:46] I wake up and I see the future I wake up
[54:50] and I see the future for my kids here
[54:52] you know
[54:54] and and
[54:56] that's where it that's that's the
[54:59] feeling you know that's
[55:01] peaceful
[55:03] thing it's it's it's beautiful right
[55:07] it's beautiful and I think people are
[55:09] when they come to here to saer that's
[55:11] what they they see and another thing is
[55:15] like if you are if you have a Bitcoin
[55:18] company if you have a if you're a
[55:20] bitcoiner I
[55:22] think ER you got to see s you got to
[55:25] come and check you know like all the
[55:28] great Initiative for moving your
[55:30] companies here or if you are like like
[55:34] this her with a 5,000 free passport if
[55:37] you are like someone that can buy to the
[55:40] country that is H right and and it's
[55:44] happening right so that is it's you know
[55:48] people say like yeah but who's going to
[55:50] pay $1 million for for the sadorian
[55:52] passport that's what people were saying
[55:55] you know when you met people you meet
[55:58] people that say man I pay $1 million and
[56:01] I'm super exciting because that's what I
[56:04] was hoping and and I want to support
[56:07] this you know so things are happening
[56:09] and not real
[56:12] Robbie I love it I love it so much it's
[56:15] really cool uh we have an end routine uh
[56:18] in the podcast where the previous guest
[56:20] is asking a question for the next guest
[56:22] uh without knowing who the next guest
[56:24] actually is uh your question from the
[56:27] previous guest uh is uh interesting
[56:31] because it's uh how do you think uh
[56:34] Bitcoin helps Humanity like what's the
[56:37] main thing that Bitcoin will uh enhance
[56:41] in
[56:43] humanity that is a good question I think
[56:46] Bitcoin is is for everyone Bitcoin
[56:50] is the Equal Opportunity equal
[56:54] opportunity not equal so right but
[56:58] Bitcoin allows everyone to have the same
[57:02] opportunities you know and it doesn't
[57:04] matter if you are from a poor country
[57:08] like whatever right like Salvador or
[57:11] country in Africa or brail or if you're
[57:16] from the United States Europe the
[57:20] people before before before Bitcoin if
[57:25] you were born in Europe United States
[57:28] Canada you already have more
[57:31] opportunities than anyone else around
[57:33] the world you know but with
[57:36] Bitcoin we have the same opportunity you
[57:40] know what that means for the first time
[57:42] to have access to the same asset that
[57:46] Michael sailor have access in Miami or
[57:50] the same asset that black rock is buying
[57:55] and some someone like green or someone
[57:57] like someone that don't even have a bank
[58:00] account in Africa or in El have the same
[58:04] access to participate and purchase the
[58:07] same thing that people like Michael
[58:09] sailor and black rck want that is huge
[58:13] for me and I think that's the equal is
[58:18] equal is for everyone it give access and
[58:22] give freedom and that's why give hope
[58:25] you know because we all see that whole
[58:30] and if people don't see it yet just a
[58:34] matter of time and but I I hope you know
[58:39] more people this is the this is the
[58:42] opportunity that we never had and we
[58:45] have it now 100% And it's it's a
[58:48] beautiful answer I just saw
[58:50] unfortunately that I wrote uh read the
[58:53] wrong uh agression
[58:56] I messed up but it it was a beautiful
[58:58] was a beautiful answer thank you for
[59:01] that uh so I I give you another question
[59:04] if you don't mind if you have if you
[59:06] still have time yeah go ahead the actual
[59:09] question was was uh what do you wish to
[59:13] accomplish in your life the most what's
[59:15] what's like the the one thing that you
[59:16] want to accomplish in your
[59:20] life that is a good question and that is
[59:22] a hard question man because I think the
[59:25] dreams
[59:27] with
[59:28] the with the years with time you know
[59:33] back in the years one of my bit one of
[59:36] my biggest dream
[59:37] was buying a home for my
[59:40] mom and
[59:42] because I grew up living I live in the
[59:46] street for seven years and we didn't
[59:48] have a place you know to to leave
[59:53] and that was like that that was my my
[59:57] dream right that I have been working for
[60:00] the for the
[60:02] last years you know and I did so I did
[60:08] now so I'm that that is one
[60:13] and now you
[60:16] know our second dream was to have a
[60:19] family and we have a family now we have
[60:21] our our kid now he's almost four months
[60:24] old
[60:27] and I
[60:28] think
[60:30] family it's everything right like if
[60:34] your family is
[60:36] good and you can
[60:39] build a family that also provide an
[60:43] example for other families is the best
[60:45] you know and and that is where we
[60:48] working you know we want to have a
[60:50] healthy family more kids and being able
[60:54] to always help you know always help
[60:58] other people ER our Dream now is we're
[61:03] supporting a lot of Bitcoin C economies
[61:05] around the world different projects who
[61:08] spend days and days trying to support
[61:11] them and
[61:12] different levels and I think I want to
[61:16] keep doing that you know I want to keep
[61:18] I want to keep feeling that my
[61:23] time I I know where we're not going to
[61:26] be here forever but I think that day
[61:29] when we're going to leave we're going to
[61:32] use our time in
[61:34] a positive way you know it I that's why
[61:39] I live my life I don't like to wait to
[61:42] live the things that I can live you know
[61:44] I don't like to planning too much in the
[61:47] future even if I think it's important
[61:50] planning it's important to you know
[61:53] having a plan that you also don't need
[61:56] to forget to live right and that's
[61:58] that's where we are you know living a
[62:00] life having dream having goals but don't
