--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] Bitcoin is much more optimistic and
[00:02] hopeful because, you know, in the
[00:03] future, I I think we all still benefit
[00:05] from having this technology. You know,
[00:06] if we change how we use it, can be used
[00:09] for to be much more productive and make
[00:11] us happier and more efficient. And
[00:13] Bitcoin has a role in that version of
[00:16] the future. And so, gold doesn't.
[00:18] There's a bit of ego involved with
[00:21] shaking out someone's pre-existing
[00:23] beliefs. get them to admit that the
[00:25] thing that they've been doing their
[00:26] whole lives or that they're so
[00:27] accustomed to is wrong is very very
[00:30] difficult. We have the opportunity to
[00:31] dive further and further in and help
[00:33] them gain knowledge in in the nuanced
[00:35] areas again of sending and receiving
[00:37] Bitcoin, right? But then how do I manage
[00:39] my UTXOs if I'm going to worry about
[00:42] privacy or worry about fees in the
[00:43] future? I am never going to just send
[00:46] someone gold or never going to spend my
[00:49] gold or if it ever gets to the point
[00:51] that I need to spend my gold, things
[00:52] will be so bad that I'll be better off
[00:54] with lead than with gold, right? I'll be
[00:56] better off with a gun and some bullets
[00:57] than with a pile of of yellow shiny
[00:59] [Music]
[01:03] rocks. Before we get started with the
[01:05] topics, uh give us some some small
[01:07] background of of who you are and then
[01:09] why you're excited about Bitcoin. Yeah,
[01:11] sure thing. So my background was in
[01:15] banking and wealth management and
[01:17] management consulting. I worked on Bay
[01:20] Street which is Canada's Wall Street for
[01:23] uh a little over 10 years before finding
[01:26] Bitcoin we could call it for the second
[01:28] time. Uh because I encountered it a
[01:31] little earlier in my career in 2010, but
[01:33] I didn't end up really buying any or
[01:35] doing anything with it. But I I sort of
[01:38] started to understand some of the
[01:39] principles and was interested in it. Um
[01:42] but towards the end of my of that part
[01:45] of my career my of my corporate career
[01:48] uh I discovered Bitcoin and started
[01:50] putting together the pieces of you know
[01:53] philosophy and technology and economics
[01:55] and it was all making sense for me and
[01:56] basically in 20 at the end of 2017 or
[01:59] early 2018 dove in you know
[02:03] uh just full full steam ahead into
[02:05] Bitcoin uh I wound up writing a book
[02:07] about Bitcoin in 2020 Magic Internet
[02:10] Money a book about Bitcoin
[02:12] and I've been advocating for it ever
[02:14] since. Really, really interesting. What
[02:17] is the the book about? Is it kind of
[02:19] like an introduction to Bitcoin? Yeah,
[02:22] it's meant to take you into the shallow
[02:24] end of the Bitcoin pool, get you used to
[02:27] the temperature of the water. I'm trying
[02:29] to introduce you to a variety of
[02:30] different topics around Bitcoin. So, you
[02:33] know, the origin story of Bitcoin,
[02:35] learning about money. I mean, the back
[02:37] of the book says, "What is money?" just
[02:39] in big letters. That's the only thing I
[02:41] have on the back of the book. Um, so
[02:43] learning about money, economics, but
[02:45] also governance, freedom, why Bitcoin is
[02:48] resilient, why its scarcity is different
[02:51] from other sort of forms of scarcity if
[02:54] you want to think about it that way or
[02:55] why its scarcity is truly absolute. Um,
[02:58] I take a look at some of the drawbacks
[03:00] or potential drawbacks of Bitcoin. Uh,
[03:02] and then I basically the idea is every
[03:04] page is its own sort of short essay. So
[03:08] you just read it in little chunks and
[03:10] you're just building your knowledge
[03:12] block by block as it were until you can
[03:14] stand back and perhaps have a a clearer
[03:17] picture of what Bitcoin is and then from
[03:19] that you can go explore whichever area
[03:21] of interest is uh you know most
[03:22] appealing to you. Why did you choose u
[03:25] magic internet money as as the kind of
[03:27] catchphrase? Um well magic internet
[03:30] money originated in Reddit. that was the
[03:33] there there's a picture of like an 8-bit
[03:35] wizard as as the original Bitcoin Reddit
[03:39] um profile picture and so I sort of used
[03:41] that as my inspiration. I also like the
[03:43] idea of a book that had some uh some
[03:45] whimsy to it. It was a little playful.
[03:47] So the text of my book, it's very
[03:50] friendly. It's very relatable. I use a
[03:51] lot of analogies. I'm not trying to
[03:53] inundate people with jargon. There's a
[03:54] lot of pictures. Uh, so again, it's
[03:57] trying to take a very complex topic,
[03:59] make it simple, make it digestible
[04:01] because it's in those little sort of
[04:02] bite-size essays. If I I'll flip to a
[04:05] page for anyone who can see visually.
[04:07] And every page is individually
[04:10] titled with a quote, and the quote may
[04:13] be historical, some kind of philosopher,
[04:16] economist, politician, but it might also
[04:18] be from a comic book. I quote Batman,
[04:20] Superman, Spider-Man, um, Charlie in the
[04:23] Chocolate Factory. It really runs the
[04:25] gamut. Um, and yeah, that's uh, you
[04:29] know, the the idea is just get you used
[04:31] to the concepts of Bitcoin and then you
[04:33] sort of go explore on your own. And and
[04:35] we talked about it before, you now
[04:36] focusing more on the the how of of
[04:38] Bitcoin with Bitcoin Mentors. Uh do do
[04:42] you think we we kind of don't have to
[04:44] explain that much more of of like why
[04:47] Bitcoin because we have really good
[04:48] books like we have a lot of different uh
[04:50] podcasts, a lot of different videos, a
[04:52] lot of different books around there. You
[04:54] know, I I'd love to say that we don't
[04:56] have to explain the wise of Bitcoin, but
[04:58] that's just it's it's not true. Um every
[05:01] Bitcoiner is still learning. Uh myself
[05:04] included obviously.
[05:06] uh we are still onboarding people as
[05:10] Bitcoiners in the sense that we're
[05:11] always talking about it, reaching out to
[05:13] people, hey, have you heard of this or
[05:14] or getting asked questions. So, we
[05:16] always need to explain the why of
[05:18] Bitcoin. But in my role at Bitcoin
[05:20] Mentor now, I don't have to focus as
[05:23] much on, you know, that part of the
[05:25] funnel in the sense that I I'm not
[05:27] dealing with people who are asking,
[05:28] well, why should I buy Bitcoin? It's I'm
[05:31] dealing with customers who or clients
[05:32] who already have a little bit of
[05:34] Bitcoin. Maybe it's on exchange, maybe
[05:36] it's in some kind of wallet. Um, they
[05:38] already have some, they understand a
[05:40] little bit of the value proposition, but
[05:41] they are also learning more and then
[05:42] trying to improve how they are holding
[05:46] their Bitcoin um to become more
[05:48] sovereign in how they hold it and
[05:50] perhaps spend it. Yeah, it's super
[05:53] interesting the the the conversion and
[05:55] the connection also between the why and
[05:57] the how because Oh, yeah. Uh there are
[05:59] and like there are really great people
[06:01] that explain the the why like I mean
[06:04] Michael Sailor but I never heard him say
[06:06] like on anything on the house side
[06:07] really. I mean there are some things
[06:09] that he explains on the houseides and
[06:11] then as you know from Bitcom Commanders
[06:13] also um Ben from PD sessions uh he is
[06:17] like really focused on the how. I I
[06:20] don't hear him a lot uh telling the why.
[06:22] Yeah, Ben's done an incredible job
[06:24] building his uh his YouTube channel and
[06:26] his following on just really sound
[06:29] technical advice uh educational
[06:32] material. Um and you know, frankly, I
[06:36] learned a ton from Ben when I was
[06:37] getting started, uh as have many many
[06:40] Bitcoiners. And it's nice to again, you
[06:42] know, you get to deal with people that
[06:44] are already interested in Bitcoin. And
[06:45] so they're sort there's a natural
[06:47] inclination that they're open-minded.
[06:49] they're looking to get away from
[06:51] existing systems. Um there's obviously
[06:53] all kinds of tangents of different
[06:55] themes are in and around Bitcoin uh that
[06:58] you can explore and dive off of, but
[06:59] it's it's you know
[07:01] his material and his content is just
[07:05] very very sound and just takes you
[07:07] through nice and slow, explains all the
[07:09] all the things he's doing as he's doing
[07:10] it. makes it really easy for someone
[07:13] who's already curious and maybe has a
[07:15] little bit of knowhow to start getting
[07:17] their hands dirty um without having to
[07:19] commit to something like, you know, we
[07:21] we we are a paid service, so you don't
[07:22] have to necessarily commit. You can just
[07:24] follow it for free and then if you have
[07:25] problems, okay, maybe you're going to
[07:26] come and check out something like
[07:27] Bitcoin Mentor. Yeah, it's it's it's a
[07:30] it's a good thing. I always say to
[07:32] people like if if you really want to
[07:34] learn it yourself and you don't want to
[07:36] pay for a service or like some kind of
[07:38] collaborative thing thing or anything
[07:40] like
[07:41] that everything is out there like
[07:43] there's sessions there are great people
[07:45] here just like go there learn and
[07:47] educate yourself and you will be good to
[07:49] go yeah like everyone at Bitcoin mentor
[07:51] will happily direct you to free
[07:53] resources obvious obviously again I say
[07:55] you know we're paid at what we do
[07:57] because some people want their handheld
[07:59] and needs a little coaching and they
[08:01] want to be able to troubleshoot and ask
[08:02] questions and you can't do that to a
[08:04] tutorial, to a video. Um, but we have no
[08:07] problem sending people free resources.
[08:09] That's the, you know, information is
[08:10] meant to be free. Um, we want Bitcoin to
[08:14] proliferate and that's one of the ways
[08:15] it proliferates. So, yeah, you know, the
[08:18] more ways to spread Bitcoin education,
[08:20] the better. Absolutely. Um, how do you
[08:22] look actually of what what do you think
[08:25] uh is is the biggest drive for for for
[08:27] Bitcoin? because I feel like we have a
[08:29] lot of education out there, but the end
[08:30] of the day prices is going up and then
[08:32] people coming in and then they discover
[08:35] all the books. It it seems like that
[08:37] that's the main main reason uh es
[08:40] especially as someone that that wrote a
[08:41] book. Yeah. You know, I wish I could sit
[08:44] here and tell you that, you know, the uh
[08:46] the freedom sovereign aspect of Bitcoin,
[08:48] that's the thing that really resonates
[08:49] with people, but at the end of the day,
[08:52] price going up is the big, you know,
[08:54] loud flashing light that just people
[08:56] cannot ignore. And that's the thing that
[08:58] brings the most people in. Um, and so
[09:02] yeah, I mean it's it's it's that old
[09:04] saying that old saying it's it's that
[09:06] expression in Bitcoin, you know, you
[09:07] come for the money, you stay for the
[09:08] tech or you stay for the revolution. Um,
[09:11] so people, I think, initially get drawn
[09:13] to Bitcoin by the prospect of uh fiat
[09:16] profits. But if they stay long enough
[09:18] and they learn enough, inevitably they
[09:21] understand that fiat profits are not in
[09:24] fact the end goal of this. The end goal
[09:26] of this is we completely upend how money
[09:31] works in the in the real world.
[09:33] Interesting. How far actually are you uh
[09:36] already on a on a on a Bitcoin standard,
[09:38] would you say? Um I'm not all the way on
[09:43] a, you know, living on a Bitcoin
[09:44] standard, per se. I live in a big city.
[09:46] I have fiat bills. Um I would say from,
[09:50] you know, day-to-day transactions, I
[09:52] still do a lot of fiat transactions. But
[09:54] in terms of um my savings and my income,
[09:59] I am very significantly you know in in
[10:02] Bitcoin. My basically all my wealth is
[10:05] stored in Bitcoin. I have no other fiat
[10:07] stocks or you know bonds or anything
[10:09] like that or even gold. I used to be a
[10:11] gold bug. I I I mentioned I was a former
[10:14] banker and investment adviser and
[10:16] basically I got uh you could call it
[10:18] redpilled on Austrian economics and
[10:21] sound money and libertarian philosophy
[10:23] during the great financial crisis which
[10:25] was right at the beginning of my career.
[10:28] And as a result of that I became a gold
[10:29] bug because I thought oh they're just
[10:31] printing money out of nothing. Money is
[10:33] worthless. We should have money that
[10:35] cannot be printed and and cannot be
[10:37] centrally controlled. and gold is a far,
[10:39] you know, superior asset to dollars. So,
[10:42] I initially started pouring my whatever
[10:44] wealth I had into into Bitcoin, uh,
[10:46] pardon me, into gold. Um, and then I I
[10:50] held gold, physical gold, not not paper
[10:52] gold. I held physical gold for I think
[10:54] it was 11 or 12 years before I finally
[10:57] dumped the last of it. I think it was in
[10:59] 2021. I finally realized that, you know,
[11:01] I'm starting to transact more in Bitcoin
[11:03] at that point. So, this is in, you know,
[11:05] 2021. I started to do a little bit more.
[11:07] I started experimenting with lightning
[11:09] using my first lightning wallet um and
[11:11] realizing that I am never going to just
[11:14] send someone gold or never going to, you
[11:17] know, spend my gold or if it ever gets
[11:20] to the point that I need to spend my
[11:21] gold, things will be so bad that I'll be
[11:24] better off with lead than with gold,
[11:25] right? I'll be better off with a gun and
[11:26] some bullets than with a pile of of
[11:28] yellow shiny rocks. Um so I just dumped
[11:31] it and uh have been it's it's like a
[11:34] monkey off my back. It's a weight lifted
[11:35] and uh you know Bitcoin is the only
[11:39] money that matters for the future and
[11:41] for frankly for an optimistic future. It
[11:44] it's so interesting like holding
[11:47] physical gold at home. I mean I don't
[11:49] know like how much but like it's it it
[11:51] seems like how do you keep that like how
[11:53] do you keep it safe? Like I have a lot
[11:55] of question on that. I had a a safe
[11:58] deposit box at my local bank and I you
[12:01] know it's not like I had those giant
[12:03] bricks, right? Those are, you know, I
[12:04] had a few little ingots and coins and
[12:06] things and it was just my savings in
[12:09] effect. Um, but I didn't have a safe or
[12:11] anything in my house. I lived in a condo
[12:13] at the time and so okay, I guess I'll
[12:15] store it at the bank, which of course in
[12:17] hindsight it's like why am I storing the
[12:19] money that's supposed to make me
[12:20] sovereign with the entity that is acting
[12:23] as a gatekeeper to my sovereignty? Like
[12:25] that, you know, there's a dis there's a
[12:27] strong disconnect there. So, Bitcoin
[12:29] allows me to to to very easily separate
[12:32] that and I can be much more sovereign
[12:33] with. Okay, I hold and am responsible
[12:36] for my money and there's no one else who
[12:38] I rely on. Yeah, this is the question
[12:41] that none of the gold bucks really can
[12:43] answer. How does gold make you more so?
[12:46] Do you keep all your wealth in gold at
[12:49] home? What if someone comes to your
[12:50] home? Yeah, I've uh I've tried to have
[12:54] some conversations with um some people
[12:57] who are perhaps newer to gold and you
[12:59] know, especially in the last few years,
[13:00] inflation has become more of a topic um
[13:04] in circles outside of Bitcoin um where
[13:07] people are starting to see gold as more
[13:09] attractive and understandably it still
[13:10] has valuable qualities. It's just not
[13:14] the apex, you know, predator of money
[13:16] per se. Um, and so I had a conversation
[13:20] with someone. I'll I'll I'll get into
[13:22] the nuance of this conversation with you
[13:23] to to give you a good example of why
[13:25] it's just not going to be money. So I
[13:27] live in Canada. We famously had the
[13:30] Freedom Convoy in 2022 in early 2022.
[13:33] Uh, Canadians donated, at first it was
[13:36] like 18 or 19 million to the truckers
[13:38] and then uh, GoFundMe froze that money
[13:41] at the government's request. And then
[13:43] there was another fiat uh donation drive
[13:46] through gives and go which where I think
[13:48] they raised another 10 or 11 million and
[13:50] again that got frozen. So Bitcoiners
[13:54] online randomly sort of gathered up and
[13:57] said you know what we should do
[13:58] something about this and they ended up
[14:00] sending I think it was $1.2 million
[14:02] worth of Bitcoin at the time to the
[14:04] truckers.
[14:05] And I was talking to a Canadian
[14:08] podcaster who was, let's say, someone
[14:11] involved with the trucker convoy, but
[14:12] just a freedomoriented individual. And I
[14:15] said to her, "So you you think gold is
[14:18] valuable now and there's merit to it?"
[14:20] And she thought Bitcoin had merit, too.
[14:21] And I said, "So why didn't the gold bugs
[14:24] donate to the truckers? Where where were
[14:26] the gold donations to the truckers? Why
[14:27] didn't they, you know, gold bugs say
[14:29] gold is money? Have you ever seen a gold
[14:31] bug spend gold as money or use it as
[14:34] money or do they just hoard it for like
[14:37] the worst case scenario? And that's
[14:39] that's the thing that also really gets
[14:41] me is gold is that doomsday money. It's
[14:44] in a world where everything is shut
[14:47] down. There's, you know, no internet and
[14:50] no telecommunications and all our
[14:52] services are are are really ramped down
[14:54] and everything has to become
[14:57] um apocalyptic in a sense. Like that's
[15:00] where gold starts to be used as money
[15:02] because again if our digital products
[15:05] and you know if our phones and and um
[15:08] computers are unavailable and the
[15:09] internet's unavailable okay I guess we
[15:11] use it then but that's kind of a a
[15:13] dismal view of the future and I'm not I
[15:16] don't want that. I don't want to push my
[15:18] energy towards that. Bitcoin is much
[15:21] more optimistic and hopeful because you
[15:22] know in the future I I think we all
[15:24] still benefit from having this
[15:26] technology. Now, are we using it
[15:28] correctly with social media and stuff
[15:29] and the way they they manipulate our
[15:31] attention? That is wrong. But the tools
[15:34] itself, you know, if we change how we
[15:37] use it, can be used for to be much more
[15:40] productive and make us happier um and
[15:42] more efficient. And Bitcoin has a role
[15:45] in that version of the future. And so,
[15:48] gold doesn't. and like so I just focus
[15:52] this is where I want to push my energy
[15:53] towards and where I want to push my
[15:54] value towards because this is where I I
[15:56] think the world needs to go.
[15:59] That's super interesting. Um you you are
[16:02] definitely aware of Jeff Jeff Booof and
[16:05] he said in my last podcast with him so I
[16:08] did two rounds with him in the second
[16:10] round he said something I struggle uh
[16:12] but that that might actually be an good
[16:15] thing. He said if Bitcoin fails as a
[16:16] medium of exchange, it will ultimately
[16:18] also fail as a store of value. And this
[16:21] is just a question in my head like what
[16:23] what he really meant by it. And I really
[16:25] want to get deep within maybe in the
[16:27] third round. Um but as you just said,
[16:30] gold is really bad as med
[16:33] exchange. So you ultimately also get got
[16:37] to that decision. I don't want to hold
[16:40] it. I don't want to use it as also as a
[16:42] store of value. So this is kind of I
[16:46] just made the connection of like oh like
[16:47] yeah that that makes total sense. Gold
[16:49] as a store of value hasn't failed in in
[16:52] particular but it could probably be like
[16:55] 10x 100x bigger if it also would be an
[16:58] amazing medium of exchange. Yeah. If you
[17:01] know again in theory if you could have a
[17:04] digitized version of gold that was
[17:06] actually onetoone to the gold and you
[17:09] could verify it then sure gold would
[17:11] have some merit. It has that 1 to 2%
[17:13] inflation rate. But again, the problem
[17:15] comes in where there's no real way to
[17:17] verify it, right? You know, apparently
[17:19] the US dollars were all backed by gold
[17:21] one day and then the next day they
[17:22] weren't, right? Because they made too
[17:24] many promises for the amount of gold
[17:26] they had and so they had to cut the gold
[17:27] tie. And so we already know what happens
[17:31] if we try to use gold as a medium of
[17:33] exchange because there's no way to make
[17:36] it work seamlessly online that we can
[17:38] send it around the world basically
[17:40] instantly because it's its physical
[17:42] presence becomes uh a a negative becomes
[17:46] a drawback to gold as as money as a
[17:48] medium of exchange. Again, in times
[17:51] where we didn't have this digital
[17:53] infrastructure, sure it made a lot more
[17:56] sense, but that's not the world we live
[17:57] in now. Now, we live in a world where we
[17:59] have computers, we have the internet, we
[18:00] have cell phones and mobile phones and
[18:01] smartphones. Um, and so we need a money
[18:04] that, you know, is interoperable with
[18:07] these technologies. Um, and Bitcoin just
[18:09] fits so much more seamlessly than gold
[18:11] ever could. Yeah. And I see Bitcoin as
[18:15] the digital version of gold, like the
[18:16] the one one pack to gold, what you
[18:19] described. Um I I see that in Bitcoin
[18:22] obviously there's never a onetoone pack
[18:25] with something physical because there's
[18:27] always someone someone trusted in in in
[18:29] the in in between. So you cannot do
[18:32] that. So we the best version of that is
[18:34] Bitcoin. That's right. The because again
[18:36] the the ledger Bitcoin's ledger the
[18:39] entirety of the ledger all of the 21
[18:41] million units can all be
[18:43] verified online without anyone in
[18:46] between doing it. With gold, the thing
[18:48] exists, right? If I'm holding a gold
[18:50] nugget in my hand and it has a, you
[18:52] know, a barcode or a serial number of,
[18:54] you know, ABC123, well, how do I
[18:57] document that token ABC123 is
[19:00] inextricably linked to this coin and
[19:03] that whoever holds the token will have
[19:06] absolute property rights and claims to
[19:09] this to this coin or token, I mean to
[19:11] this coin in my hand. And there's just
[19:13] no way to do that because if I'm holding
[19:15] it, like I could just hand it to the
[19:17] person next to me and now they have it,
[19:18] but the token is owned by someone
[19:20] somewhere else. And so again, how do you
[19:23] enforce that claim? Because that's
[19:25] basically not possible. It just it
[19:27] doesn't make sense. Like it'll never
[19:28] work. It'll never work. Full stop.
[19:32] There's nothing I can really add to
[19:33] that. It'll just never it'll never fully
[19:35] work. Whereas Bitcoin again I can my key
[19:38] if I have my private key I can prove
[19:41] 100% no one you know it's very binary
[19:43] yes or no yes I control my Bitcoin no I
[19:46] don't if I control the key I control the
[19:48] coins very simple I can't do that with
[19:51] gold if I control the gold private key
[19:53] token but the coin the physical coin
[19:55] exists somewhere else in the real world
[19:57] while someone else might have it so yeah
[20:00] yeah it's
[20:01] it's this is I mean I did not think we
[20:05] make gold Bitcoin, but it's it's just
[20:07] something that annoys me a lot with with
[20:10] gold bucks when they always talk about
[20:13] the sovereignty and the importance of of
[20:15] gold and then they're like, "Oh, but you
[20:17] could have a digital version of gold and
[20:19] just like have that and verified and
[20:21] like how do you ver like that's not
[20:23] possible." As soon as you start to go
[20:25] down that train of thought, you know,
[20:27] the the ultimate logical conclusion of
[20:30] that train of thought is Bitcoin like
[20:32] bit and it's better because there's the
[20:34] absolute scarcity versus the well, we
[20:36] don't actually know how much gold exists
[20:38] in the earth trust and you know as time
[20:41] goes on and the price let's say of gold
[20:43] goes up as as Sailor has mentioned is
[20:46] when price goes up you know gold miners
[20:48] will go further into the wilderness and
[20:49] dig deeper into the earth to try to find
[20:52] more gold because there's more incentive
[20:54] to do so. Whereas with Bitcoin, if price
[20:56] goes up, yeah, we can work harder in
[20:59] terms of mining to get to get more
[21:00] Bitcoin, but it's not going to change
[21:02] how much Bitcoin is coming online. It's
[21:04] just going to drive up the competition
[21:05] to earn that exact same scarce amount of
[21:08] Bitcoin.
[21:10] And this is something I think uh and I
[21:13] always say that nobody is is bullish
[21:15] enough on on on on Bitcoin. I think CK
[21:18] is probably most known for for that
[21:20] phrase. Uh, and I will soon have Samson
[21:23] M on the podcast. Let's see if he's
[21:25] bullish enough on Bitcoin. I guess I
[21:26] think he's pretty bullish on Bitcoin.
[21:28] He's he's definitely very bullish on it.
[21:31] But I think uh most like 95% of of even
[21:36] Bitcoin as I feel like are not bullish
[21:37] enough on on Bitcoin just because we
[21:40] don't know what this digital scarcity
[21:43] actually means. If like 8 billion people
[21:45] can have it and you cannot make more of
[21:48] it and we never really had that. Yeah.
[21:50] the combination of absolute scarcity as
[21:53] well as just the sheer value of the fiat
[21:57] monetary premium that exists whether
[21:59] it's in art and real estate and gold and
[22:01] all these and stocks and all these other
[22:03] assets and debt I suppose um you know to
[22:07] compute and really think about a you
[22:09] know how much value could flow in at the
[22:11] end of the day and how much value is
[22:12] still yet to be artificially created in
[22:14] the fiat world that will also flow in
[22:17] because as Lyn Alden would say right
[22:19] there's no stopping the train in terms
[22:20] of the money printing and the dead binge
[22:21] spending. Um, so there's still so much
[22:25] room to go, so much more demand to come
[22:27] in. And you know, if you're having
[22:28] conversations in the real world, it it's
[22:30] so funny how even for me, I've been in
[22:35] Bitcoin call eight years or so, eight
[22:37] and a half years, and it's still a
[22:40] broken record of conversations. people
[22:41] who I've had the same conversations with
[22:43] every year, every 6 months, every 18
[22:46] months, whatever it may be. The
[22:48] conversation started when Bitcoin was
[22:50] maybe 5,000 and then it, you know, we
[22:52] have the conversation at 25,000. Then we
[22:54] have the conversation it's 90,000. And
[22:57] my message is still the exact same. Just
[23:00] you should stack some Bitcoin. Like have
[23:02] some Bitcoin, accumulate. You don't have
[23:03] to buy a whole coin if you can't afford
[23:04] it, but just h having zero is the wrong
[23:07] amount of Bitcoin. Have some. You can
[23:09] have your other assets if you're not
[23:10] really ready to dive all the way into
[23:12] Bitcoin at the start. Not everyone is.
[23:14] You have to learn more about it and get
[23:16] comfortable with it before you're going
[23:17] to, you know, take the leap or go all
[23:19] in. And obviously, as time goes on,
[23:21] whatever little bit you may have started
[23:23] with starts to become a bigger and
[23:25] bigger part of your portfolio. And so
[23:26] naturally, you're also going to pay more
[23:27] attention to it and become more
[23:28] interested in it. Um, yeah.
[23:33] Why do you think it's so hard to
[23:34] understand or like different ask what do
[23:37] you think we can do better as Bitcoin
[23:39] educators? I wish I had a great answer
[23:40] for that. Um you know be consistent
[23:42] which we are. Um I think maybe you know
[23:45] what I I will give you one thing we can
[23:47] do is ask questions rather than tell
[23:51] people what you think. Um, it's easy for
[23:54] a Bitcoiner to go, "Hey, you should look
[23:55] at Bitcoin because this, that, and the
[23:56] other." Rather than pushing your message
[24:00] onto people, which as we know from just
[24:03] normal conversations, people like to be
[24:06] heard, right? Just want to get their
[24:07] point of view across. Um, but truly
[24:10] engaging with someone and activating
[24:12] them and using the Socratic method of
[24:15] asking a question and getting them to
[24:17] see if they really know the answer. And
[24:19] if they don't again pushing further by
[24:21] asking more questions of well you should
[24:22] look into this and what do you think and
[24:24] you know do you know how fractional
[24:26] reserve banking works? Do you know that
[24:27] that's how our monetary system is run?
[24:29] You know do you understand the print you
[24:31] know how fiat is a debt back currency
[24:34] and is destined to just take on more and
[24:36] more debt because any reduction in debt
[24:40] is basically a form of deflation which
[24:43] they do not permit. um and effectively
[24:47] leads to the bankruptcy of the the
[24:49] system. So they ne necessarily need to
[24:51] keep printing. You know, pushing the
[24:53] questions and asking about fiat so they
[24:57] can try to understand the problem. Maybe
[25:00] that will help guide people more towards
[25:02] okay, maybe I can start to see Bitcoin
[25:03] as a solution rather than just some
[25:05] random thing that's been invented that
[25:08] is obscure and complex and people seem
[25:10] to be in love with and they're in a cult
[25:12] and all that stuff.
[25:14] um get them thinking is would be my
[25:17] message to to ask questions. I love that
[25:21] so much that you brought that up. I
[25:23] often ask people completely new to
[25:25] Bitcoin, if you are God, how would you
[25:29] define or build the perfect money? Okay,
[25:33] that is amazing because I've done the
[25:35] same thing and uh there was one at one
[25:38] point in time I wanted to write a blog
[25:40] post post or something about like how
[25:42] would you build the perfect money you
[25:44] know like start asking people if you
[25:46] could make the perfect money what do you
[25:47] think it should be what do you think it
[25:49] should look like so yeah we're very much
[25:50] aligned in uh in that I I even did that
[25:53] in an Austrian university at like uh it
[25:56] was not a university course it was from
[25:58] an individual organization but it was in
[26:00] the university and I think there were
[26:02] like 30 people there and it was supposed
[26:04] to be like one and a half hour long a
[26:06] course on Bitcoin but I was like I will
[26:08] not stand there one hour and and explain
[26:10] what Bitcoin is. I want to give them
[26:12] some something to think about because I
[26:14] know I cannot orange anyone in one and a
[26:16] half hours. Yeah. And I literally uh
[26:20] made the first half an hour like hey
[26:23] what do you think uh if the perfect what
[26:25] is the perfect money for you? like what
[26:27] what attributes what properties what
[26:28] what things uh have to happen and people
[26:31] say like oh yeah I I want that the
[26:33] perfect money should be everywhere
[26:35] accepted I should not be exchanging it
[26:37] uh like when I cross borders and there
[26:40] were like 50 things coming along along
[26:43] the way then you just group them and
[26:45] categorize them and you're like oh
[26:47] like that's the that's the properties of
[26:49] sound money and then we just went
[26:51] through all the assets like oh like
[26:53] would Bitcoin fulfill that would euros
[26:55] fulfill that And just to make a long
[26:57] story short, this uh course was so cool.
[27:02] It was supposed to be one and a half
[27:03] hour long. We were there for 4 hours
[27:06] without break and everyone loved it
[27:08] because everyone was involved and we
[27:10] were discussing about different
[27:11] properties. Oh, I don't like that if
[27:13] perfect money. Oh, I would like all of
[27:15] the sudden there were 20 people that
[27:16] never thought about money discussing
[27:19] what perfect money would be and they
[27:20] came to the conclusion yeah like Bitcoin
[27:22] is actually a really good idea. So what
[27:24] you did again sort of following that
[27:26] Socratic method of asking questions is
[27:29] and like you said rather than you
[27:31] pushing the message on them and talking
[27:33] about Bitcoin and highlighting all the
[27:36] amazing attributes of Bitcoin by asking
[27:38] the questions and and stirring the pot
[27:40] of discussion, you're getting them to
[27:42] orange pill themselves rather than you
[27:44] orange peeling them. their active
[27:47] engagement and conversation and back and
[27:49] forth ends up orange pilling themselves
[27:51] because now they've come to the
[27:52] conclusion in a sense that oh yeah
[27:54] there's there's merit to this thing
[27:56] Bitcoin actually accomplishes a lot of
[27:57] the stuff we think makes sense and we
[27:59] need oh maybe I should look more into
[28:01] this so that's brilliant that's
[28:03] brilliant that's well done let's take a
[28:06] break for a moment and appreciate the
[28:08] beauty that coin vigilante has made with
[28:11] the Bitcoin watches those watches are
[28:14] the most amazing the most elegant way of
[28:17] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner
[28:20] and Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[28:22] completely new and amazing Genesis
[28:25] edition of their watch collections. You
[28:28] have the date of the first ever mind
[28:31] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[28:34] also the block height and which epoch we
[28:37] are currently in. I love the level of
[28:40] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[28:42] Make sure to check out those amazing
[28:45] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[28:48] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[28:51] much. And now, if you have Bitcoin, I
[28:53] really do hope that you don't have it on
[28:56] exchange. But if you do have it on
[28:57] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[28:59] deal with that. The first way is you put
[29:02] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[29:04] entry for you to get into the
[29:06] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[29:10] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[29:12] super simple and secure way. And if you
[29:15] check out the link in the description,
[29:17] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[29:20] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[29:23] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[29:26] partner in terms of how to get the most
[29:29] out of your sovereignty. They will
[29:32] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[29:35] that is perfect for your individual
[29:38] situation. They will show you how you
[29:40] can secure your own devices. Securing
[29:43] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[29:44] have to keep all your devices secure.
[29:47] One topic that is overlooked often is
[29:49] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[29:52] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[29:55] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[29:57] place already? And last but not least,
[29:59] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[30:01] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[30:04] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[30:09] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[30:12] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[30:15] will be for the first time ever speaking
[30:17] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[30:20] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[30:23] really looking forward to seeing all of
[30:25] you there. You can get your ticket in
[30:27] the link down in the description of
[30:29] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[30:32] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[30:35] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[30:37] there. Yeah, we we categorized the
[30:39] different columns and named it. Uh and
[30:42] then we listed the assets and we was
[30:44] like, does this asset accomplish that?
[30:47] And I started with the euro, like it was
[30:49] in Austria, like euro is our fiat
[30:50] currency. And everyone is like, oh,
[30:54] weird. Uh our currency that we use every
[30:57] day is really far away from perfect
[30:59] money.
[31:02] But but people are just so set in their
[31:05] ways and it's they're there's a bit of
[31:08] ego involved with shaking out someone's
[31:11] pre-existing beliefs, right? To get them
[31:13] to admit that the thing that they've
[31:15] been doing their whole lives or that
[31:16] they're so accustomed to is wrong is
[31:19] very very difficult. People get set in
[31:21] their ways. It's understandable. We all
[31:22] have a little bit of that. Um, and it's
[31:25] very difficult to truly be open-minded
[31:27] to, hey, you know, can I consider the
[31:29] possibility that I am wrong? That's
[31:31] something I believe or I think is wrong.
[31:34] It's tricky. It's hard. It requires,
[31:36] again, coming back to Jeff Booth a
[31:37] little bit, you know, you have to s be
[31:39] willing to sacrifice your ego to an
[31:40] extent. Um, and so it's rare to find to
[31:46] find that in someone. And it's even
[31:48] harder to create that environment for
[31:50] someone. It's super super super rare. I
[31:53] mean we we we all
[31:56] are every day um a victim of that
[32:00] ourselves and uh there even even as
[32:03] Bitcoiners we we have probably things in
[32:05] our lives where we could be more open.
[32:07] Uh but uh money is such such a weird
[32:11] thing because we interact with it every
[32:14] day and like oh you you never asked the
[32:16] question what is money and I asked
[32:19] myself the I mean even uh I mean Michael
[32:21] Sailor I think was uh saying that in his
[32:23] early podcast that before Bitcoin he
[32:26] really never asked the question what is
[32:28] money and and he dealt with a lot of
[32:30] money of course. Yeah. Again, it's like
[32:33] why would you? You're raised as a kid.
[32:35] The dollars are your system. You're used
[32:37] to the bank accounts. It starts with
[32:39] checks and and dollar bills and it
[32:41] graduates to credit cards and debit
[32:43] cards and and now you know gift
[32:45] certificates and whatnot or um you know
[32:48] electronic transfers and Venmo and all
[32:51] that kind of stuff. And it's just this
[32:53] gradual shift. It's part of the same
[32:56] story and it's been around for as long
[32:58] as you are aware. So, who are you to
[33:02] rock the boat and suggest that it could
[33:04] be different or better somehow? We're
[33:06] just humble plebs, right? What do we
[33:08] know that the lords of finance that the
[33:11] uh the central bankers and the the Jamie
[33:13] Diamonds and the Mark Carney of the
[33:15] world that that they don't know that
[33:16] these guys who've been at the tippy top
[33:18] of the pyramid and and get to look down
[33:20] and see all the things like, you know,
[33:21] they they should know best and you know,
[33:24] we should probably have a degree of
[33:26] faith in them because things have been
[33:27] working well enough. And so yeah, it's
[33:30] very very hard to challenge that and
[33:32] question that. Um and because that sort
[33:35] of institutional structure and the
[33:37] messaging apparatus, right, it's all
[33:39] very strong and or seemingly strong I
[33:42] should say. Um so it's very very tricky
[33:44] to push back against that especially
[33:46] against again people who are just very
[33:48] set in their ways because okay the
[33:49] system yeah it's not perfect but it's
[33:52] good enough right people are willing to
[33:54] settle well it's good enough well I
[33:56] don't want to have to change because
[33:57] this is working and I'm familiar with it
[34:00] how do you think then we are coming to
[34:02] this this Bitcoin world will it be that
[34:04] most people will be forced into it
[34:06] because it will be so obvious and
[34:09] they're like kind of peer pressured into
[34:10] it or will people wake up and and
[34:13] realize what Bitcoin is. Um it seems to
[34:17] me, you know, we've we've talked about
[34:19] or I shouldn't say we as in you and me,
[34:22] but um you know, we know the gradually
[34:24] then suddenly ethos, Parker Lewis's
[34:26] essays. Um I believe was it Cory Clipon
[34:30] wrote about the intrigent minority. Um
[34:34] Alexky, I forget what he wrote. I forget
[34:37] the exact title of of his article, but
[34:39] basically there seems to be a prevailing
[34:41] school of thought and it makes sense to
[34:43] me that you're going to get the five 10%
[34:47] of people who just eventually clue in
[34:49] and get it and are strong enough in
[34:51] their convictions and it could be 3% I
[34:54] shouldn't say 5 to 10% 2 3 5% whatever
[34:56] the number is a very small minority that
[34:58] just get it and when enough wealth and
[35:02] influence sort of accumulates there it
[35:04] inevitably just pulls the masses along
[35:07] and they're not necessarily going to
[35:08] have a say in it. It's just things will
[35:11] drift that way and they will all benefit
[35:14] from it. You know, whether they're early
[35:16] adopters or not, everyone benefits in my
[35:18] view from the world, you know, shifting
[35:20] to a larger Bitcoin standard. It's
[35:22] obviously a long-term trend and
[35:25] it's starting perhaps to crescendo to
[35:28] some degree or at the beginning of its,
[35:31] you know, the the current run. But every
[35:34] time I think, oh yeah, Bitcoin's going
[35:35] to go up and and then everyone's going
[35:37] to pay attention. It's never quite the
[35:39] case. There's still a lot of power and
[35:41] influence and wealth on the other side
[35:43] of things that needs to be won over.
[35:45] It's going to take a lot of time. Um,
[35:47] but it seems to me
[35:49] that there's just sort of this mushy
[35:52] middle ground of people, whether it's
[35:54] 50%, 60%, 80% of people, that they'll
[35:58] just follow the strongest leader when
[36:00] the strongest leader emerges. And
[36:01] Bitcoin is strong. Is it the strongest
[36:04] leader? Not yet. But it is very very
[36:06] strong and seeming, you know, gaining in
[36:10] strength and momentum. And the more that
[36:12] happens, the more likely it is that
[36:14] okay, the mushy middle will inevitably
[36:15] just follow along. Yeah. There's this
[36:18] theory on if if 4% of the world are
[36:21] completely intolerant about uh Bitcoin
[36:26] speak, they only want to earn in
[36:27] Bitcoin, they only want to spend in
[36:28] Bitcoin, they only want to save in
[36:30] Bitcoin. Yeah, this is kind of forcing
[36:32] everyone else also to accept Bitcoin
[36:35] because 4% are like really hardcore on
[36:38] it which means probably like 10 20 30%
[36:42] really also like it and then and then
[36:44] there's like uh really fast majority
[36:47] building if like a hardcore group of 4%
[36:50] is is is really hard on it. Yeah. So
[36:53] that school of thought or line of
[36:55] thinking that that makes sense to me.
[36:57] You know, I I'm not smart enough to game
[37:00] plan exactly how it's all how all the
[37:02] dominoes are going to fall. All I can
[37:04] say is that, you know, I see the
[37:05] incentives lining up and I see the
[37:07] trends and I think it's coming. It's
[37:09] just a matter of time and how the
[37:13] dominoes fall over, let's say. You said
[37:16] something interesting before. You said
[37:18] uh a positive future with with Bitcoin.
[37:20] What do you think is is different in a
[37:22] Bitcoin world than than the world we
[37:23] have now? I mean now we already have
[37:26] Bitcoin but like a pre Bitcoin world uh
[37:29] everything
[37:31] um
[37:33] Bitcoin you become more discerning when
[37:36] you have Bitcoin and you decide that
[37:38] okay I at some point everyone's going to
[37:40] spend some of their Bitcoin right I I
[37:42] don't think we should aim for the world
[37:45] where we own our Bitcoin and then we
[37:48] borrow against it in fiat I mean I get
[37:51] the appeal and the benefit of that don't
[37:53] get me wrong but like that's not the end
[37:55] state of things. The end state is fiat
[37:58] is worthless at some point and so all
[38:01] that borrowing concept fades away and
[38:04] rather than living in a debtbased system
[38:06] which is the fiat system and and using
[38:09] it to our advantage which some people
[38:10] are able to do, right? Sailor is able to
[38:13] use the fiat system to his advantage to
[38:14] accumulate much more bitcoin than he
[38:16] could otherwise. Um we would ultimately
[38:19] be living in a capital-based system
[38:21] where again you either have capital or
[38:23] you don't. You either have Bitcoin or
[38:24] you don't. Bitcoin being the capital.
[38:26] Um, and because capital is scarce, you
[38:30] become more discerning with how, why,
[38:33] and when you spend it. Fiat, it's like
[38:36] easy come, easy go, right? We can just
[38:38] accumulate, accumulate Bitcoin. We'll
[38:39] take out more and more debt. Sorry.
[38:40] Accumulate more and more fiat. Take out
[38:42] more and more debt. So you can spend and
[38:45] be a bit of a consumer and buy things
[38:48] you don't need and get that um that sort
[38:52] of instant gratification of of you know
[38:54] retail therapy of buying things that
[38:57] don't are fleeting and don't really
[38:58] matter. But with Bitcoin, you're going
[38:59] to be more careful because you only have
[39:01] so much. And sure, it's still the the
[39:04] purchasing power appreciates over time,
[39:05] but you don't want to spend it
[39:08] um unwisely because it's difficult to to
[39:11] come by and to accumulate. Um, and so if
[39:15] we're changing our thought process in
[39:17] terms of both earning and spending, then
[39:19] of course that's going to manifest in
[39:21] economic
[39:22] activity. So things that are wasteful
[39:26] and unnecessary and harmful will start
[39:29] to fall by the wayside because people
[39:31] are going to spend their money on things
[39:32] that they think they're going to get
[39:34] much better long-term value for. Um, and
[39:37] so everything changes. That's I love
[39:41] that. I it's like I I describe Bitcoin
[39:44] kind of as a fork in the road of
[39:46] humanity. There are certain forks in in
[39:48] in the in the road uh of of human
[39:51] civilization. Uh I mean there's like
[39:53] printing press, electricity, uh the
[39:55] steam engine, like there's many
[39:57] different examples and I think Bitcoin
[40:00] might even be the biggest one just
[40:03] because it touches on money that well
[40:06] that's the thing I I in the intro to my
[40:08] book I wrote about or I describe you
[40:11] know if you have bad money you have bad
[40:14] social outcomes. It's there's a direct
[40:17] correlation, but if you have good,
[40:19] honest, sound money, you're going to
[40:21] have good, honest, sound outcomes. It's
[40:24] not to say that the outcomes are going
[40:26] to be perfect, but it's going to be
[40:27] significantly improved compared to the
[40:29] direction we're going in now. There's
[40:30] less, you know, inclination for
[40:33] destruction and waste, which obviously
[40:35] there's this incentive to destroy and
[40:37] create waste. Now, that fades away on a
[40:40] more Bitcoin focused standard. Um so
[40:42] good bad sorry bad money bad outcomes
[40:45] good money good outcomes that's total
[40:48] fork just like you said it brings the
[40:51] truth in the in the in the system also I
[40:53] really like the the personal
[40:56] accountability that bitcoin brings in it
[41:00] when you all of a sudden are your own
[41:02] bank and you cannot you cannot blame the
[41:05] banks the governments whatever for
[41:07] anything else you're like hey that's my
[41:08] bitcoin I'm sovereign of it I am in
[41:11] control to make more of it and and stuff
[41:13] like that. So like I I think personal
[41:16] accountability and the truth and the
[41:19] truth back in the system really changes
[41:22] a lot in our society. Yeah. Personal
[41:24] responsibility is just like time
[41:26] preference. Personal responsibility is a
[41:28] huge huge element in this. Again with
[41:30] fiat you don't have to take personal
[41:32] responsibility. The bank looks looks
[41:34] after it for me. If I send a a wire or I
[41:37] do a purchase on my credit card. Oh, I
[41:39] can call them up. Oh, I made a mistake.
[41:40] reverse it. Um, oh, someone hacked me.
[41:43] Can you go in and restore the balance or
[41:45] whatever it's going to be? That doesn't
[41:47] exist in Bitcoin. Like, you have to do
[41:49] it for yourself. And the very act of
[41:53] taking that
[41:55] responsibility, you know, it it is
[41:57] personally empowering and again, that's
[41:59] part of the thing that sort of manifests
[42:01] in your decisions out in the real world.
[42:03] Yeah, it kind of reflects uh on it. I
[42:06] also want to touch with you on on on the
[42:08] Bitcoin community uh because it could be
[42:10] interesting. How do you look at uh what
[42:12] what the current Bitcoin community is is
[42:15] like? I see a lot of those mirroring
[42:17] effects of people put their own values
[42:20] onto Bitcoin and then expect like the
[42:22] community to also behave like that. I
[42:24] mean with my favorite example is always
[42:26] diet. They are like uh carnivore steak
[42:31] eaters. They're like vegans in in
[42:33] Bitcoin and they're all like, "Oh, like
[42:35] that's how I eat. I have Bitcoin. That's
[42:38] how all Bitcoiners should eat should
[42:39] eat." How do you how do you look at the
[42:41] the community currently in in in
[42:43] Bitcoin? The way I see it is they are
[42:47] trying to get to the truth, right? And
[42:49] they're adamant and they're passionate.
[42:51] Um, and so, you know, sure, eating meat
[42:54] seemingly seems to be better for you.
[42:56] I've certainly become, you know, I eat
[42:58] meat much more frequently than I did
[43:00] five or six years ago and I'm don't have
[43:02] to feel bad about it or anything like
[43:04] that. I I think it's good for me. Um,
[43:07] but I'm still open-minded to, you know,
[43:09] is this the only way? It's not that I'm
[43:11] a full carnivore or anything like that.
[43:13] Um, but I can take the information that
[43:16] Bitcoiners are willing to put out there
[43:18] and incorporate it into my life. And if
[43:20] you're meeting people in the real world,
[43:21] you can start to learn from them and
[43:23] their experiences because again, they're
[43:24] more open-minded, right? If they came to
[43:26] Bitcoin, they have to be open-minded to
[43:28] some degree. And so they they've already
[43:30] killed their ego to a degree. They're
[43:32] willing to be wrong about things. So you
[43:35] can talk through things. It's it's I
[43:38] find it easier. They're more comfortable
[43:40] with talking through difficult subject
[43:42] matter. Um they're willing to be wrong.
[43:45] You know, we think we're right about a
[43:47] few things. You know, Bitcoin is one.
[43:49] Sure, carnivore could be another that or
[43:51] just you know that we think yeah there's
[43:53] there's probably more benefits than not.
[43:55] Um but I think at large the point is
[44:00] they're more open-minded and as a result
[44:02] of that you get to discover more about
[44:05] what's out there and what you can do.
[44:08] You don't have to follow a
[44:11] pre-prescribed path that may have
[44:13] existed. there are infinite
[44:16] possibilities and you know you can just
[44:20] do things right go out there and just
[44:22] figure out what's happening and why
[44:23] something's happening um and just try
[44:26] things and see what happens maybe maybe
[44:28] carnivore is good for you maybe it's not
[44:30] some people it you know meat doesn't I
[44:32] have a friend who you know he likes his
[44:34] red meat but it just it upsets his
[44:35] stomach it's just who he is he would
[44:37] love to probably eat more of it but he
[44:40] just he just can't so that's okay like
[44:42] that's who he is he has to work with
[44:44] what's best for am um but at least he's
[44:47] you know can look around and understand
[44:49] oh yeah you know there there there may
[44:50] be something here but it doesn't always
[44:53] have to be for
[44:54] me very very true you you have to and
[44:58] that's a big thing actually uh this
[45:00] talking through things and being open to
[45:02] things I've noticed a lot in the Bitcoin
[45:04] community even if you throw something at
[45:08] someone that they really disagree
[45:11] with outside of Twitter uh
[45:15] they they are willing to talk through
[45:17] that and they are really open open to
[45:19] that. I I think Twitter is always a
[45:21] special place for for fights uh and it
[45:24] encourages fights and all those things.
[45:26] So uh if someone just lives in the
[45:29] Bitcoin community just on Twitter, I
[45:32] just can say go out go to a meetup go to
[45:36] a conference. People are actually really
[45:38] chilled
[45:39] minded. Yeah. Twitter Twitter is not
[45:41] real life. like it it it can be fun at
[45:43] times. It can also be depressing at
[45:45] times. So, you know, you got to balance
[45:46] it out. Um, but it's designed to suck
[45:49] away your attention. I think we know
[45:51] that or should know that. But yeah, like
[45:53] you said, you go to a meetup and you
[45:55] talk to people who might seem very toxic
[45:57] online and for the most part they're
[45:59] pretty chill and happy to have a
[46:00] conversation and you know there's a
[46:03] topic they may be adamant about online
[46:04] but in person they see you know the
[46:08] human being on the other side of it just
[46:10] as you're seeing them as the human being
[46:11] on the other side of things and then
[46:12] suddenly everyone can become more
[46:13] relatable um and there's room for
[46:16] discussion as opposed to just I mean
[46:18] it's not 180 limit character limit
[46:20] anymore but just okay I got to get my
[46:22] point across in this short little time
[46:24] span and I have to be right because you
[46:26] know mom someone's wrong on the internet
[46:28] I got to stay up late and you know prove
[46:29] them wrong or whatever like that doesn't
[46:30] happen in the real world. Yeah very
[46:33] true. Uh one more topic that I really
[46:34] want to discuss with you around the
[46:38] Bitcoin mentors uh is what kind of
[46:40] question you usually getting and and
[46:42] like uh what are you trying uh to do
[46:45] there? So it's like um what are the the
[46:48] common question that that you usually
[46:49] get? Um
[46:52] common question.
[46:54] So, you know, we're tending to focus on
[46:58] wallets are are one of the key
[47:00] components of what we do. We do we help
[47:02] with nodes. Uh we can help with mining.
[47:05] We can help with some other stuff, the
[47:06] third party servers or open source
[47:08] servers, you know, things like start 9
[47:10] and umbrell and all that.
[47:12] Um but really the questions
[47:16] are how do I describe this? um they can
[47:20] be technical but also kind of
[47:21] straightforward if you're a seasoned
[47:23] Bitcoiner. So things just like how
[47:26] private keys work and how backups work
[47:28] or
[47:30] UTXOs, you know, when you if you get
[47:32] your first wallet, you just sort of send
[47:35] and receive and you think it's as simple
[47:36] as that. And and to a degree it is, but
[47:39] there's also so much nuance. And so as
[47:42] we get to know people, you know, we can
[47:45] we have the opportunity to dive further
[47:46] and further in and help them gain
[47:48] knowledge and in the nuanced areas again
[47:51] of sending and receiving Bitcoin. Great.
[47:54] But then how do I manage my UTXOs if I'm
[47:56] going to worry about privacy or worry
[47:58] about fees in the future? Um, so I I
[48:02] hesitate to say that I receive common
[48:05] questions because everyone's a little
[48:06] bit different. Um, but I do find
[48:12] myself trying to find relatable
[48:15] analogies for how things work so that
[48:18] they can
[48:20] uh really envision and and have a clear
[48:23] picture of the tools in their hands and
[48:24] how and why it works. And I'll give you
[48:26] a couple quick examples. Um, number one,
[48:29] when we talk about private keys, one of
[48:30] the analogies I like to use is, you
[48:33] know, think of the wallet. If you're
[48:34] using something like Sparrow Wallet and
[48:36] it doesn't matter if you Nunchuck, Blue
[48:37] Wallet, whatever wallet it may be. It's
[48:40] sort of like a browser. You're doesn't
[48:42] matter if you're using Chrome or Firefox
[48:45] or, you know, or or Safari or whatever
[48:47] it may be. It's a browser. And if you go
[48:50] to, you know, your email account and you
[48:52] type in your email and your password,
[48:55] only you see those emails and only you
[48:57] can write from that email account. Your
[49:00] private key is like your password to
[49:02] your email. Doesn't matter what browser
[49:05] you're on. So I can use my mobile phone,
[49:07] my my computer, I can open a browser on
[49:10] any browser and read my emails.
[49:12] Similarly, I can use my private key on
[49:14] any device and I can see my coins and I
[49:17] can manage my coins. So that's sort of
[49:19] one analogy I like to use that really
[49:20] helps illustrate how, you know, the
[49:24] device itself is not the most important
[49:26] element of your Bitcoin setup. it's your
[49:30] your the backup of your seed phrase of
[49:32] your private key is actually the most
[49:33] important and then how you obviously
[49:35] secure it and if you're going to do
[49:36] multi- signal all that stuff that's a
[49:37] whole other story. Um and then another
[49:40] analogy that's come out of uh that was
[49:42] wasn't mine but uh one of my colleagues
[49:45] I used to describe UTXOs as sort of like
[49:48] dollar bills, right? If I have a $50
[49:50] bill and a $20 bill and a $10 bill in my
[49:52] wallet, I have three UTXOs. Um, and
[49:56] maybe I send one and I'm going to get
[49:58] change back when I if I buy something.
[50:00] If I buy a sandwich for $20 or $25, I
[50:04] only have a 50, I give a 50 and I would
[50:06] get a $25 bill in return. Except the
[50:10] difference is in fiat, the denominations
[50:11] are preset. Whereas in Bitcoin, it's
[50:14] whatever denomination is sent or
[50:15] received. But we sort of discovered that
[50:18] that's maybe not actually the best
[50:20] analogy. A better analogy is melting
[50:22] gold. So, I have 1 oz of gold and I'm
[50:26] going to pay something for something
[50:28] that's2 ounces. Well, I'm going to melt
[50:30] down my gold, give off 2 to the person
[50:34] I'm buying from, and I keep the 08 um
[50:38] instead because every time you send and
[50:40] receive, you're sort of melting and
[50:42] recasting your gold, except this is
[50:45] digital as opposed to, you know, really
[50:47] melting. and it happens like that as
[50:49] opposed to, you know, sitting by a hot
[50:51] fire and uh and and melting it down and
[50:54] waiting for it to cool and dry after the
[50:55] fact. It's it's a lot uh it's a lot
[50:58] easier to melt Bitcoin together than me
[51:01] together. Yeah, there's a lot less work,
[51:03] at least on on our end. And I I I rarely
[51:07] do how-to videos. And for how-to videos,
[51:10] I always say like go to PDC sessions.
[51:12] But I actually did one on UTXO
[51:14] management with one guy that I expect
[51:17] respect a lot um in that field. It's
[51:19] wicked. You probably know him. Uh and I
[51:22] did with him only it's it's really rare
[51:25] that I do those kind of videos. I did
[51:27] only on UTXO management and on how to do
[51:31] it and and why you should do it and why
[51:34] you should be caring about UTXO
[51:37] management not just because of dust and
[51:39] unspendable Bitcoin but also as a
[51:41] privacy standpoint uh and and manage all
[51:44] those things. So uh if if if you want to
[51:48] if if someone says like oh what the what
[51:49] the heck are they talking about UTXO
[51:51] management that's a a great start. Yeah.
[51:54] But yeah, PDC sessions has has all the
[51:57] other how-to videos and and how to is
[52:00] way better. It was one of my uh attempts
[52:04] to also do some how-to videos. Um but I
[52:08] just enjoy way more just talking with
[52:10] people about the Bitcoin opinions. Yeah.
[52:12] Yeah, exactly. This this is more fun.
[52:14] Ben Ben puts in some hard work, I can
[52:16] tell you. Just, you know, getting to
[52:17] know him a little bit in the background,
[52:18] you know, he he works hard at his craft.
[52:21] Um, obviously he's very very good at
[52:23] what he does. And there's other great
[52:24] educators out there. You know, Ben's not
[52:25] the only one, but um, I certainly
[52:28] believe he's one of the best um, that's
[52:30] out there. And yeah, it's it's great to
[52:32] see, you know, more people doing this
[52:34] because we do need, you know, there
[52:35] can't just be one educator or one book
[52:38] or one podcast, right? It's the more the
[52:40] marrier. There's no single source of
[52:42] truth in Bitcoin. I I tell people all
[52:44] the time, you know, if you want to learn
[52:46] about Coca-Cola, you go to
[52:47] Coca-Cola.com. You read their quarterly
[52:49] statements, right? It's all in the one
[52:51] website. But if you want to learn about
[52:52] Bitcoin, there's no central repository
[52:54] to go to. You have to sort of cobble
[52:57] together information from different
[52:58] sources and then you have to filter it
[53:00] yourself because, you know, no one's
[53:03] prefiltering it for you. There is not
[53:06] really
[53:07] see I mean there's a I there is for me
[53:11] not a second
[53:14] uh Ben. So like there is there's a lot
[53:16] of people that only focus on the why.
[53:18] Yeah. And they sometimes also do a
[53:20] little bit of the how. But Ben is really
[53:22] unique because he I think covered almost
[53:26] everything. I I think he asked me
[53:28] actually when he was on the podcast, oh,
[53:30] is there anything we didn't cover
[53:32] because I I should should cover that and
[53:34] I was like, I I looked at the channel
[53:36] and like I I I wouldn't know any topic.
[53:39] Uh, and I I couldn't say any other uh
[53:44] bigger YouTube channel in video format
[53:48] that does only how-to videos on Bitcoin
[53:52] on on only Bitcoin also there. No crypto
[53:55] or anything like that. Yeah, I I you
[53:57] know, I I'll say I think I'm aware of
[53:59] one or two other channels like Southern
[54:00] Bitcoin or you mentioned Wicked. Um, but
[54:03] obviously I think, you know, Ben is, I
[54:05] think, the biggest and and perhaps, you
[54:07] know, for a lot of people the best and,
[54:08] you know, I would agree he's the best.
[54:10] Um, again, I learned a lot from him
[54:12] getting started. I consider him a
[54:14] friend. We work together. Um, he's an
[54:16] awesome Bitcoiner and just an awesome
[54:18] guy all around, frankly. Uh, as you
[54:20] know, you were on his on, as we were
[54:22] discussing on the show recently on Why
[54:24] are we bullish? Um, so yeah. Yeah.
[54:27] Wicket also has a YouTube channel. Oh
[54:29] gosh, I wasn't I wasn't even aware. I
[54:31] always saw his I told we there's no
[54:34] central repository. There may be the
[54:35] bigger and the best like Ben, but
[54:37] there's there can't be one single source
[54:39] of truth in Bitcoin.
[54:41] Not Not even Ben. Not even Ben. We love
[54:44] Ben, but there's not even Ben can be the
[54:46] single source of truth. He he he will be
[54:48] happy. We we talked too much about him
[54:50] today,
[54:53] but I love him. Uh he's a he's a great
[54:54] guy. Um I ask each and every single each
[54:57] and every single one of my guests the
[54:59] simple question. What can we learn from
[55:01] you besides Bitcoin?
[55:03] Oh, what can you learn from me beside
[55:05] Bitcoin? I can probably teach you about
[55:06] a few mistakes I've made. Um, just to be
[55:10] open-minded and be willing to be wrong.
[55:14] Like, you know, don't and doesn't matter
[55:16] what topic. Literally, no topic should
[55:19] be out of bounds. Um, be willing to be
[55:23] wrong about things. consider someone
[55:26] else's perspective and other people's
[55:28] point of views that you know maybe they
[55:30] have some insights you don't none of us
[55:32] are omnipotent we don't know everything
[55:33] we have tons of information at our
[55:36] fingertips but do we have all the
[55:38] information and do we have all the
[55:39] necessary wisdom to correctly assemble
[55:42] that information probably not so it's
[55:45] good to learn and figure things out but
[55:49] no matter how well you think you figure
[55:52] things out um What's that phrase? It's
[55:55] uh you know, strong opinions, weakly
[55:58] held.
[55:59] So, learn, be
[56:02] open-minded, grow smarter, work harder,
[56:05] but don't be afraid to change your mind
[56:08] when new information presents itself. I
[56:10] know I have over time. Yeah. A big thing
[56:13] is also for me, as you said, like the ex
[56:16] excluding things. I think all Bitcoiners
[56:18] can really uh talk about that because
[56:21] they haven't excluded Bitcoin. And I
[56:23] think a lot of people right now exclude
[56:25] Bitcoin. They dismiss it and don't even
[56:27] give it a fair chance because they heard
[56:29] some some weird line from newspaper or a
[56:32] friend or a cous like whatever and now
[56:34] they dismiss it because of that reason
[56:36] and it's it's a yeah reason why most
[56:38] people I said uh I said all through uh
[56:41] through co that propaganda is a hell of
[56:43] a drug and
[56:45] uh you know it's it's true for that
[56:48] particular period of time. It's true for
[56:50] Bitcoin. It's true in many other fields.
[56:52] And once you start to see through that
[56:54] and understand that it's out there,
[56:56] whether you think you live in the free
[56:58] world with free press information that
[57:00] there's lots of information that is
[57:03] purposely trying to confuse you or
[57:06] divide you. You and you can start to
[57:08] pierce the veil. Then yeah, you can
[57:10] start to approach topics with a new set
[57:12] of eyes and really start to assemble on
[57:15] your own merit and through your own
[57:16] critical thinking what makes sense, what
[57:19] doesn't, do things work, do they not
[57:20] work? Um, and become a better person as
[57:23] a result. 100%. We have an end in the
[57:26] podcast where the previous guest is
[57:28] asking a question for the next guest
[57:29] without knowing who the next guest
[57:31] actually is.
[57:33] And it's it's a very cliche uh question
[57:39] and I'm surprised that in almost I'm I'm
[57:43] free episodes to 500 uh guests. Almost
[57:46] 500 episode nobody ever asked that
[57:48] question and you get the cliche
[57:50] question. Um what's the meaning of life?
[57:53] Uh is 42 I believe is the correct
[57:55] answer. Right. It's 42. The number 42.
[57:58] Yeah. We're all finding out, you know.
[58:01] I'm uh I'm eager to discover the uh the
[58:03] meaning of life. I'm I'm actively
[58:05] working on it. I don't expect I'll ever
[58:07] figure it out, but uh I'm working hard
[58:09] to get there. I I love that. It's uh
[58:14] actually when when he the previous guest
[58:16] asked me that, oh, like what do you
[58:18] think is the meaning of life? And I'm
[58:19] like, I'm 26. Like I I
[58:24] I don't think I have an answer with 50,
[58:27] but I'm sure I don't have an answer now.
[58:30] Yeah, I I I I got a few years on you and
[58:32] uh I'm probably no further ahead than
[58:35] than you are.
