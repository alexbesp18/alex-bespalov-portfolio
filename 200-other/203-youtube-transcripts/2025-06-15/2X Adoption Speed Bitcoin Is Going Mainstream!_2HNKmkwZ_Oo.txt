[00:00] Bitcoin has an incredible power to make
[00:02] collaboration between entrepreneurs much
[00:05] easier the next 10 years is going to
[00:07] totally reshape the way the internet
[00:08] works you won't really interrogate a
[00:10] website so much as you'll have different
[00:12] AI agents and tools available to them
[00:15] that will interoperate and for them to
[00:17] interoperate I think you need something
[00:19] like Bitcoin to be the glue that holds
[00:20] it all together Bitcoin is going
[00:22] mainstream you have all the corporations
[00:24] and government's starting to take an
[00:25] interest the only winning move is to
[00:27] play this Bitcoin game the Bitcoin
[00:29] standard is going to be homeschooling
[00:30] it's going to be self- sovereignty it's
[00:32] going to be creativity it's going to be
[00:33] Renaissance men it's going to be tough
[00:35] people it's going to be strong people
[00:37] and it's going to be kind to people
[00:38] Bitcoin is fundamentally about restoring
[00:40] honesty and trust to the
[00:42] [Music]
[00:46] world I love how you described Bitcoin
[00:49] you said it's the meim of exchange for
[00:52] robots I love that yeah I think we're
[00:55] about to go through a huge explosion of
[00:58] two exponential Tech Technologies I
[01:01] think everyone here probably already
[01:02] knows about Bitcoin being a total
[01:05] paradigm shift in the way we use money
[01:07] but I also think that the combination of
[01:09] AI and Bitcoin is going to be really
[01:11] interesting and I think the next 10
[01:13] years is going to totally reshape the
[01:15] way the internet works I don't think
[01:17] we're going to be staring into
[01:18] rectangles you know inquiring them you
[01:21] know engineering Search terms anymore I
[01:23] think AI really changes the game and I
[01:25] think that Bitcoin has an incredible
[01:27] power to make uh make make collaboration
[01:31] between entrepreneurs much easier and
[01:34] making sort of an an I call it an
[01:36] internet of tools where you won't really
[01:38] interrogate a website so much as you'll
[01:40] have different AI agents and tools
[01:43] available to them that will interoperate
[01:46] and for them to interoperate I think you
[01:48] need something like Bitcoin to be the
[01:49] glue that holds it all together so
[01:52] Bitcoin is kind of the The Tool uh of of
[01:56] all those AIS and yourself also to uh
[02:00] power them up
[02:01] basically yeah and it's not just me
[02:04] there others doing this but I I think
[02:06] making things Bitcoin payable removes
[02:09] friction because once once the apis are
[02:13] Bitcoin payable and Bitcoin scannable
[02:15] that means you can take an automated
[02:17] system and have it scan those and put
[02:20] them together into you know its Mission
[02:23] as an agent to to act on behalf of the
[02:25] the user so this is a new paradigm
[02:29] because the way apis have worked in the
[02:30] past is you have to go set up an API key
[02:34] do evaluation do all this stuff put in
[02:36] all this engineering effort and that is
[02:38] a massive frictional barrier I think the
[02:41] future is going to be all of these tools
[02:44] that are that are scannable and payable
[02:47] by Bitcoin and you'll be able to combine
[02:49] them in different ways so that's why our
[02:52] company's called cascader I'm I actually
[02:54] have a background in electrical
[02:55] engineering when you Cascade two two
[02:57] circuits together you're combining their
[02:59] effect to make an even better effect so
[03:01] you could think of like a guitar
[03:03] amplifier where you you have all these
[03:05] different effects that you can put
[03:06] together and that's different circuits
[03:08] cascaded together in the same way I
[03:10] think you're going to see the internet
[03:12] evolve in this way AI agents and uh
[03:15] Bitcoin payable Services evolve in this
[03:18] way and so we've built we've built a
[03:20] bunch of prototypes at cascader we're
[03:21] really happy about it and the the the
[03:24] interoperability is just incredible but
[03:26] but also just the the things it does for
[03:29] privacy and just for proliferating our
[03:31] values of privacy Liberty and human
[03:34] flourishing into the
[03:36] future interesting uh do you also think
[03:40] that EI is kind of amplifying uh the
[03:43] Bitcoin
[03:44] adoption I don't know if it's amplifying
[03:46] it I think there is a danger with AI I
[03:49] think you know Peter teal went on the
[03:51] Nixon seminar which was like it it's
[03:53] usually a discussion between tech people
[03:55] and the I think the Secretary of State I
[03:59] think it was Mike Pompeo and teal and
[04:01] they talked about how um in some ways
[04:04] you could see AI as sort of like a
[04:06] totalitarian technology if you're not
[04:08] careful because it has this ability to
[04:10] find a needle and a hay stack so if
[04:12] you're not careful with your privacy
[04:15] anything that you put out there will be
[04:17] instantly scannable and usable by um by
[04:21] people that may not have your best
[04:22] interest sit hard maybe governments
[04:23] maybe corporations that are conspiring
[04:26] against you so you have to be careful
[04:27] with your your privacy so that's that's
[04:29] one of the reasons that privacy is a
[04:31] core value but also just we want to be
[04:34] at the Forefront of this AI Revolution
[04:36] so that we can push we can steer this
[04:38] ship in the direction we want to go in a
[04:41] way that's focused on you know
[04:43] individual liberty individual human
[04:45] flourishing that's super interesting uh
[04:47] perspective I I actually never thought
[04:48] about that like when when uh governments
[04:51] can use AI to find all those small
[04:54] things that they wouldn't even they
[04:56] wouldn't had the manpower to find but
[04:59] all of a sudden they have those data and
[05:02] the tools to uh really look into them
[05:04] and analyze them and get like a report
[05:07] from them within seconds wow yeah you
[05:11] can you can find a needle and a hay
[05:13] stack so so there there is that's kind
[05:15] of the Doomer aspect but the flip side
[05:16] is if you're an individual you're an
[05:19] entrepreneur you can scale up your
[05:22] Manpower effectively you know 300 400%
[05:26] by using AI whereas a big corporation
[05:29] best case scenario maybe it's 10 15 20%
[05:32] it's not as it's it's not always as
[05:34] powerful but I think um really the the
[05:37] the
[05:38] big you know fuel for all of this is the
[05:40] underlying data so just just um get
[05:43] getting the data and making them open
[05:45] source and you I'm really proud of what
[05:47] Zuckerberg did I know I know that he
[05:49] just made a big announcement but I think
[05:52] you know what he did with making sources
[05:54] open uh models open source is is really
[05:57] important for uh I think for Humanity
[06:00] itself because the alternative is to
[06:01] just have all these big companies with
[06:04] all the best AI systems so I he shout
[06:07] out to Zuck for you know having the the
[06:09] foresight and possibly also just doing
[06:12] it out of competitive selfishness but
[06:15] either way he he might have saved
[06:17] Humanity with that one simple move wh
[06:19] what did he do so he released the oama
[06:23] model so these were all face internal
[06:25] Facebook models so he he kind of saw
[06:28] where the puck was going realize that
[06:30] open AI Google and Amazon you know es
[06:33] but especially open AI were starting to
[06:35] get a lot of traction with their llm
[06:37] Technologies so he decided to open
[06:40] source uh at least certain models I'm
[06:42] sure they have more stuff but he open
[06:44] sourced the the Llama models and some of
[06:46] the other models and people were able to
[06:47] take those and tweak those and now you
[06:50] have a whole community of people on
[06:52] sites like hugging face that tweak those
[06:54] or make new ones or they take them and
[06:56] they make them uncensored even and I
[06:58] think that's just that was just really
[07:00] important for um for open source and for
[07:04] um to to level the playing field and I I
[07:07] suspect that Zuck just did it out of
[07:09] sort of a you know scorched Earth
[07:12] competitive you know analysis that he
[07:14] wasn't gonna be able to to jum leap over
[07:16] them but maybe he can he can throw sand
[07:18] in their gear so whatever the reason is
[07:21] that he did it I'm glad he did um and
[07:23] and we should be happy about that we
[07:25] should embrace these tools and use
[07:27] them why is uh for maybe for people that
[07:30] are not tax heavy why is open source in
[07:33] general so uh important and maybe also
[07:36] specific for
[07:37] AI yeah I mean I think as bitcoiners we
[07:40] understand Bitcoin is open source and
[07:42] the reason why that's important is
[07:44] because all it takes is one line of code
[07:46] to completely ruin everything right so
[07:48] you could you if if and if it's not
[07:50] auditable if you can't check What's
[07:53] called the check some you can't check
[07:54] the fingerprint to make sure Yep this is
[07:56] the the code that it says it is and it's
[07:58] running exact the way I want it to you
[08:01] know it's kind of like having um a car
[08:03] that you can't fix or um you know having
[08:07] certain certain aspects hidden so if
[08:09] there's one line of spyware if there's
[08:11] one line of malware in a piece of
[08:13] software that can ruin everything pretty
[08:16] easily so with these open source models
[08:19] what what they do is they they give
[08:21] entrepreneurs like like you and me the
[08:24] opportunity to run them um you know we
[08:26] we were able to audit you know what what
[08:28] the weights are what everything is so so
[08:30] it has two effects the first is that it
[08:32] you can audit it so it's transparent and
[08:35] the second effect is that we can kind of
[08:36] use them as we please we can take them
[08:39] and and and change them and and make
[08:41] adjustments to them without spending
[08:42] tens of millions of dollars on trying to
[08:45] train the base model we get this base
[08:47] model that we can use and and kind of
[08:50] kind of just like the car analogy take
[08:51] it and make modifications to our inter
[08:54] it's it's I I love the a perspective
[08:58] switch of like if Bitcoin code wouldn't
[09:01] be open source would you still and
[09:03] wouldn't be open source and not
[09:05] verifiable would you still trust it and
[09:07] I think 99.9% of the people listening to
[09:10] this would probably say oh no like that
[09:13] then it's private money then the thing
[09:15] of like is it really just 21 million
[09:18] does it all those things really or is
[09:21] that just like marketing that's all for
[09:23] like yeah we we have to believe it uh
[09:27] and the same but the same thing doesn't
[09:29] seemingly to all the other softwares
[09:31] people are like oh like I don't care if
[09:33] Apple doesn't open source everything I
[09:35] don't care if Microsoft doesn't open
[09:37] source everything like people really
[09:40] don't care about some other aspects of
[09:42] it but Bitcoin wouldn't be here if it
[09:45] wouldn't be open source yeah I think
[09:47] there's a very human thing about don't
[09:49] mess around with my money right um I
[09:52] think that I think that's why it's so
[09:53] impressive what all of the you know
[09:55] Federal Reserve Banker types have been
[09:57] able to do in perpetuating this s up
[10:00] that it's okay that just leave it to the
[10:02] experts don't don't question anything
[10:04] that's quite impressive when you think
[10:06] about it but I I would even go further
[10:08] as to say I wouldn't trust Bitcoin if it
[10:10] wasn't auditable I wouldn't trust a
[10:11] wallet if it isn't auditable because I
[10:13] don't know if there's spyware in there I
[10:14] don't know if they're stealing my money
[10:16] somehow in a way that's not transparent
[10:18] you know and that presents a challenge
[10:20] for a lot of entrepreneurs because if
[10:22] you're going to go make a wallet now you
[10:23] have to make it open source well that
[10:26] means that at any point somebody could
[10:27] Fork it potentially and steal your
[10:30] thunder and we've seen that happen with
[10:32] other entrepreneurs with some of like
[10:33] the the cold even the cold storage
[10:35] wallets you know I it's hard to
[10:37] completely trust a cold storage um
[10:39] wallet that does isn't auditable because
[10:41] they might even if they're not malicious
[10:43] they might have made a mistake and you
[10:45] don't know about it so so it's
[10:48] um there's a lot of effects it kind of
[10:50] kind of flips everything on on its head
[10:52] in a weird way it's it's it's there's
[10:55] almost nothing more libertarian than
[10:56] that but there's also nothing more
[10:59] communist than just letting letting the
[11:01] whole world see your code but I think in
[11:03] a way it's beautiful it's it's um it's
[11:06] it's a unique Paradigm that uh I I
[11:09] actually wasn't that familiar with till
[11:10] I started you getting involved in the
[11:12] Bitcoin Community I started to
[11:14] appreciate more and more how important
[11:15] open source can be that's interesting
[11:18] that that open source as you described
[11:21] with libertarian and communism it's it's
[11:24] almost like if it's not forced it cannot
[11:27] be not libertarian because because it
[11:29] incentivizes the free market like uh
[11:32] then you you you have a code and someone
[11:35] else can just take it uh which will
[11:39] incentivize all Market participants to
[11:42] be as competitive and as good as they
[11:44] can and that's basically the the the the
[11:47] the principle behind free and open
[11:50] market you want everyone to compete uh
[11:53] so we can all get better uh but yeah
[11:56] it's it's an interesting aspect I also
[11:58] never thought about about open source
[11:59] being like a free market tool in a way
[12:03] if it's not forced if you force everyone
[12:04] to be open source I don't know if that's
[12:06] free market because for fullness is
[12:08] usually not open source is usually not a
[12:10] free market tool it's interesting to
[12:12] think about that yeah it's a volunte and
[12:15] you know at cascader we were spinning
[12:17] out new applications and modules like
[12:21] every week you know we ship pretty fast
[12:23] and sometimes there's a discussion like
[12:25] okay should we make this one open source
[12:27] or not um the ones that have made open
[12:30] source were uh very strategic and we
[12:32] said you know it makes it makes total
[12:34] sense so I'll give an example we made
[12:36] pull that up jamie. and that allows you
[12:39] to search the internet and kind of let
[12:41] us be the shield between you and big
[12:43] Tech and let you search the internet and
[12:45] use llms to summarize content so you get
[12:48] the convenience of like a open AI uh or
[12:52] Claude but you also get the uh
[12:54] verifiability of the sources it'll it'll
[12:57] cite the sources that it's referencing
[12:59] in line and give you all the sources and
[13:01] so we built we built on the shoulders of
[13:03] giants there's a great project called
[13:05] cxg which lets you it's called a meta
[13:08] search engine and what it does is goes
[13:10] in Duck ducko Go Google Etc all the
[13:13] other ones grabs those results and then
[13:15] displays them now we also added in
[13:17] Bitcoin payments which means we can
[13:19] create a sustainable business model
[13:20] where you pay us help us maintain the
[13:23] system but also keep your privacy
[13:25] because botht 11 invoices have great
[13:28] sender privacy so there would really be
[13:30] no way for us if you're using a VPN
[13:32] you're using Bitcoin there will be no
[13:34] way for us to trace exactly who you are
[13:36] and what you're asking that's how it
[13:37] should be yeah that's that's a lot of
[13:39] the concerns I have actually because I
[13:42] am at this point a power user of uh cgbd
[13:45] it's it's just so good in in the
[13:47] day-to-day work for my uh podcast um but
[13:51] also I feeded a lot of data to help me
[13:56] the best way possible because the more
[13:58] it knows from the podcast obviously the
[14:00] podcast is an little bit of an easier
[14:03] topic because well it's anyways out in
[14:06] the open on YouTube and everything so
[14:08] like I'm not concerned about that too
[14:10] much uh but uh in other fields when you
[14:13] talk to it it picks up stuff it gets to
[14:15] know you uh and it really has a way
[14:18] clearer picture of that if you use uh
[14:21] jbd just like you would use Google or
[14:24] any other search engine for that matter
[14:27] uh you really reveal just with
[14:29] questions a lot of data from yourself
[14:33] and then it collects that it organized
[14:36] that it knows so much more about you and
[14:39] can even pick up other things that maybe
[14:41] Google wasn't picking up and Google was
[14:43] even already is a huge privacy concern
[14:47] how how do you how do you look at the
[14:49] the Privacy aspect of of those popular
[14:52] eii tools yeah I I think just there
[14:54] there's multiple aspects right so so the
[14:56] first is just tying your identity to to
[15:00] the the usage itself so at least being
[15:02] synonymous is is more ideal because
[15:05] that's going to at least give you some
[15:07] leverage and some power over you know
[15:09] them profiling you as an individual
[15:11] right so that's why vpns are really
[15:14] important that's why I think a lot of
[15:15] lightning payable Services can be really
[15:18] powerful but the flip side is there's
[15:20] there's other techniques for you know
[15:23] encrypting end to end in such a way that
[15:25] you you know totally obfuscate you know
[15:29] what's going on EX sa for the absolute
[15:31] need to know uh secure compute so
[15:34] somebody that's pioneering this is the
[15:36] for former Mutiny wallet team rebranded
[15:39] now they're open secret and they're
[15:40] taking the great technology they made
[15:42] for you know um getting getting around
[15:45] being a money transmitter you know
[15:47] encrypting everything so that they're um
[15:49] they're not responsible for money
[15:52] transmission taking that stack and then
[15:54] kind of making almost like a proton mail
[15:56] as a service so they have a service
[15:57] called Maple AI that lets you encrypt uh
[16:01] from the client to the secure compute
[16:03] and it's just it's just that it just um
[16:06] it just it just runs inside their secure
[16:08] compute and the developers like me who
[16:11] you know we're going to probably
[16:11] collaborate the developers like me won't
[16:13] even be able to see what the queries
[16:15] themselves are it would just be sort of
[16:17] off fiscated and not correlatable so
[16:19] that's that's an incredible Innovation
[16:22] as well and I think these types of tools
[16:24] are going to be really important and it
[16:26] comes back to personal responsibility of
[16:28] are you going to op into a system that
[16:30] is going to take advantage of you and
[16:31] treat you like you know like cattle like
[16:34] data cattle or are you going to be in a
[16:35] system that's going to you know respect
[16:38] your privacy respect your
[16:41] individuality uh you mentioned vpns uh
[16:44] do you always use wepn is that something
[16:46] that's uh important yeah I I I'm always
[16:50] using a VPN a lot of the times I set it
[16:52] all I said it with a kill switch if I'm
[16:54] you know leaking any data because you
[16:56] never know when you're going to receive
[16:58] you a link that you're going to click on
[17:00] that that you want to stay private you
[17:02] you don't want to have a profile and you
[17:04] know Google makes it incredibly hard for
[17:06] me to use them because I use a VPN and I
[17:10] also just don't give give up the data I
[17:11] don't sign into Google services so I
[17:14] almost take it as a compliment yep my
[17:16] Ops sec's good you guys are trying to
[17:17] force me through a capture and
[17:19] thankfully I don't really have to do
[17:20] that anymore because I pulled that up
[17:21] jamie. I just use that as my default
[17:24] search and I'm able to find uh pretty
[17:26] much everything I need and in fact
[17:28] probably faster and better because it
[17:30] presents the information in an intuitive
[17:32] way instead of just showing me a bunch
[17:35] of ads so it's just it's just a better
[17:37] experience it's uh what do you mean with
[17:39] kill
[17:40] switch uh sorry kill switch meaning um
[17:44] if I'm not connected to the VPN or
[17:46] there's difficulty connecting the VPN it
[17:48] shuts down all my internet service so it
[17:51] doesn't go around the VPN and leak um
[17:54] you know leak information on my inter
[17:55] internet service provider or others or
[17:57] websites I think I found the website is
[18:00] the pull.up jamie.com
[18:03] a ohai okay there's
[18:07] also yeah pull it up jamie. oh that
[18:10] looks that looks a little bit more right
[18:13] actually I want to share that uh is is
[18:16] so that's that's something that you
[18:18] developed uh and that's basically uh
[18:21] there's an open open AI like not from
[18:24] open AI but like an open AI model behind
[18:27] that yeah yeah so so we made an open
[18:30] source as of right now it is uh it's
[18:33] uses Claude actually as the default but
[18:35] you can switch to chaty PT that's what
[18:37] the settings gear does in the future
[18:40] we're going to collaborate with people
[18:41] like the the former Mutiny team and set
[18:43] up their llm which is maple that runs if
[18:47] I'm not mistaken it runs AMA 3.1 in a
[18:51] sec secure compute environment so you
[18:53] kind of get the best of all worlds so
[18:56] that would be our preference so we're
[18:58] going to keep keep evolving this and
[19:00] making it better and another
[19:03] announcement you know that we're going
[19:04] to have in the next couple days is a
[19:06] releasing the beta of our podcast search
[19:08] so we have a very fast um podcast search
[19:12] uh algorithm I actually have a bunch of
[19:14] Robin S podcast in there so I was
[19:16] actually able to research and um look at
[19:18] the types of things that you're
[19:20] interested in speaking about I I I
[19:21] listen to the show regularly but uh it
[19:24] was cool to see how I could pull out
[19:25] specific clips and then get like a
[19:27] sharable clip that has the Deep link
[19:30] inside it so you just click the share
[19:31] button send it to your friend and you
[19:33] can dump them directly in the podcast
[19:35] exactly where you want them to be and so
[19:37] I I find that super helpful as a podcast
[19:39] efficient Auto being able to find things
[19:42] fast and share that share just the need
[19:44] to know the most important parts with my
[19:46] friends and even make notes on uh on
[19:49] important developments wait and you that
[19:52] that is that tool something else no so
[19:55] uh it's not it's not live yet but uh I
[19:58] I'll let you guys know as soon as it's
[19:59] live but it essentially it's a very it's
[20:01] very fast we use state-ofthe-art
[20:03] techniques to to surface fast and you
[20:06] can ask you know it's it's a it's using
[20:09] the flexibility of llm type technology
[20:12] to quickly search and find the um find
[20:16] the intent behind what you're trying to
[20:18] say in other words you could you could
[20:20] ask a you could you could search a word
[20:22] that isn't necessarily um a direct match
[20:25] but they under but it's understood that
[20:27] it the meaning is is close um the
[20:30] mathematics of this stuff is actually
[20:31] really interesting but it can it can
[20:34] essentially just boil down you know what
[20:36] you're intending to search and what what
[20:38] the topic is and then sort them based on
[20:41] relevance and uh so I found that really
[20:44] useful in my research and we're excited
[20:46] to release that in the next couple days
[20:48] here I think it'll probably be out by
[20:49] the time this podcast is out really cool
[20:52] let me know when this is out because I
[20:53] do a lot of research on podcast because
[20:56] uh for the guests uh obviously I do that
[20:59] every day sometimes two three times uh
[21:02] and it's interesting because I also use
[21:05] like in the beginning I actually did my
[21:06] research myself in the beginning of the
[21:08] podcast I needed one two hours for each
[21:10] podcast guest and I also had just like
[21:12] two three per week now I have it every
[21:15] day I don't just simply don't have time
[21:16] to uh research one guest like three
[21:19] hours what I do now is just find three
[21:22] four videos where the guest was on on
[21:25] another podcast or where he has a
[21:27] presentation or whatever
[21:29] the the topic is and use the transcript
[21:31] and just put the plain text into jbd uh
[21:36] and uh from from there I go uh so it
[21:40] takes me now around like 10 15 minutes
[21:43] to prepare because I usually know the
[21:46] guest uh really quickly and can see some
[21:49] things and I I see a lot of patterns um
[21:52] but it would be even cooler if I just
[21:55] say like oh like research Jim and he
[21:58] pulls uh all the things up and maybe
[22:00] shows me like oh see here there are four
[22:03] uh 30 seconds Clips you might want to
[22:05] look at it because here he says
[22:06] something really interesting uh that
[22:08] would be really cool and I think it
[22:10] would be um a nice thing uh definitely
[22:13] for me to have to the research for the
[22:15] the podcast and uh one last thing we
[22:18] have to use jgd for that yeah you know
[22:21] it's meant to be your your research
[22:22] assistant it's a it's meant to bring you
[22:24] on the level of Joe Rogan who has you
[22:26] know infinite resources that's what we
[22:27] call it pull that up Jamie and there are
[22:29] other podcasters that we've worked with
[22:31] like for example Brandon from Green
[22:33] candle Investments you know he does a
[22:35] live stream every day as you're talking
[22:37] about it's a complete grind in arms race
[22:39] to keep putting out high quality content
[22:41] like what he does every day and he uses
[22:43] pull that up Jamie to research the
[22:44] different macro topics he wants to
[22:46] discuss and you know quickly and easily
[22:48] surface good content good articles good
[22:52] um you know good uh themes for what he
[22:55] wants to talk about in the live stream
[22:57] so uh SAR similar use case to you so I
[23:00] encourage you to to also check out pull
[23:02] that up jamie. I think you'll be
[23:04] impressed really cool what role does uh
[23:08] with because Bitcoin is probably not the
[23:11] the the best layer for a especially for
[23:14] a payments uh you probably need like a
[23:16] lightning or maybe even like a lay bu to
[23:18] make like those micro payments from
[23:20] machine to machine uh what role do you
[23:23] think uh Layer Two and lightning plays
[23:25] with a ey or is that you meant lightning
[23:28] anyways when you talked about Bitcoin
[23:30] yeah when I'm talking about Bitcoin I am
[23:32] talking about lightning so we use the
[23:34] Bitcoin connect module created by the
[23:37] Albi Team so they did a really good job
[23:38] making it really simple and easy for
[23:41] buyers of services like yourself to just
[23:43] click a button and hook up your Noster
[23:45] wallet connect connection um I think I
[23:48] think I I typically say Bitcoin micro
[23:50] payments because I think this is going
[23:51] to keep evolving we don't know if
[23:53] lightning is the final thing I'm very
[23:54] impressed by lightning but there are
[23:56] issues with it that makes onboarding
[23:58] difficult especially if you're just you
[24:00] know a normie that's that's sitting on
[24:02] zero it is challenging uh I was able to
[24:05] get my mom to do it though so I think I
[24:07] think Albi has done incredible work of
[24:09] making that ux much much better and I
[24:12] think it will continue to get better as
[24:14] Lightning evolves and as Bitcoin itself
[24:16] evolves and there's other forms of micro
[24:18] payment technology you know we we'll
[24:20] probably accept them it just comes down
[24:22] to you know basically getting you the
[24:24] functionality of being able to create a
[24:26] sustainable value forv value business
[24:28] model but also retain your privacy with
[24:30] these awesome bolt 11 pay uh micro
[24:32] payments but there will probably be
[24:34] other forms as we go forward how high
[24:36] would you rate the chances of uh
[24:39] lightning being completely replaced I
[24:41] get that there will be extensions and
[24:43] lightning will be a bigger role but is
[24:45] there even a chance that lightning will
[24:46] be completely replaced as Layer Two dech
[24:49] I think lightning in its current form
[24:52] exactly as it is today there's near 100%
[24:55] chance and I think there's a lot of
[24:56] people looking into other uh other
[24:59] Technologies like super scaler and
[25:01] multi-party channels I think that could
[25:03] vastly improve things and if that's the
[25:05] case then you know it is still lightning
[25:07] but it's a pretty big facelift for
[25:10] lightning um and from that point I don't
[25:12] know maybe 5050 I know that the arc guys
[25:14] are working really hard on creating you
[25:17] creating an alternative or um you know
[25:19] maybe even a subnet of lightning that
[25:21] makes it even easier to use I I don't I
[25:23] don't uh I don't work a lot in that
[25:26] space per se I don't I'm not um
[25:28] developing the rails I'm using the rails
[25:31] so I'm not super qualified on exactly
[25:33] what the likelihood is but I if I had a
[25:35] guess I think there's a near 100% chance
[25:38] that either lightning will get a massive
[25:40] upgrade or there will be something other
[25:42] than lightning that we use or some you
[25:44] know subnet of lightning like Arc that
[25:47] somehow enhances lightning in a way that
[25:49] it makes it you know so that your mother
[25:51] that doesn't understand technology it
[25:53] all can on board in a second it's also
[25:55] interesting uh if you if you have like
[25:57] aell custodial wallet or a custodial
[26:00] wallet which makes a huge difference
[26:02] because like custodial is all already
[26:04] quite easy it's it's like you download
[26:07] an app uh you put in an email address
[26:10] and you basically have the same
[26:11] experience and it's super like you for
[26:13] examp I don't know you're in America I
[26:16] guess yeah you don't use wallet of
[26:20] Satoshi well I can't uh I mean they
[26:22] withdrew uh you know I technically
[26:24] probably could could find it um you know
[26:27] it's unfortunate I know that they a
[26:28] pretty good ux for a lot of people but
[26:30] you know fundamentally it is a credit
[26:32] system it is an IOU system I I do like
[26:35] to see people move towards non-custodial
[26:37] Solutions I think the Phoenix team has
[26:39] done a really good job I think that the
[26:42] Albi Team has done a really good job you
[26:44] know really the the main pain point is
[26:47] if someone's on zero they got to get
[26:49] Bitcoin first then they gotta open a
[26:52] lightning Channel somehow and that's
[26:54] that's the challenging part but I think
[26:56] people are starting to get creative and
[26:58] understand these challenges and make it
[27:00] even easier and easier so I always say
[27:03] you know it's the mom test in a
[27:06] different way the mom test is a popular
[27:08] book but the mom test here is can you
[27:10] hand this to your mom and have her
[27:11] figure it out without you you know
[27:13] coaching her through the whole thing I
[27:14] think we're we're a little ways away
[27:16] from that but I think in the coming
[27:18] years it'll get even better and better
[27:20] yeah that that's what I kind of was
[27:22] trying to to get to because it's it's
[27:25] like if you have an app like wallet of
[27:28] satosi that's the only uh custodial
[27:31] wallet I I I I know uh it's super like
[27:35] everyone can use it but it's custodial
[27:37] not like it's it's it's not it's not
[27:39] non-custodial uh it's not your self
[27:42] custodial so which brings the topic of
[27:45] like how important is it to have
[27:48] lightning on uh self- custodial way um
[27:53] right now probably in the future it's
[27:55] way more important especially if we we
[27:58] more and more people lose access to the
[28:00] main layer so you want to stay more
[28:02] connected to the the up layer but
[28:04] currently I only use lightning for
[28:07] paying here and there if I have to and I
[28:09] the maximum amount I have there is like
[28:11] 50 bucks maybe 100 bucks uh if the r
[28:14] pull me I'm okay with
[28:16] that uh but uh long term it's probably
[28:21] the the more important thing like it's
[28:23] it's more in in the future where we have
[28:25] to get to noncustodial right yeah I
[28:28] think people are realizing that you know
[28:30] especially when fees were spiking when
[28:32] the whole ordinal craze started they
[28:35] realize that lightning isn't
[28:36] sufficiently insulated from layer one in
[28:39] such a way that you're gonna be able to
[28:41] open and close channels at will you're
[28:43] or you're gonna um you know I know that
[28:45] a lot of the watchtowers bug out because
[28:48] if the'll fees Spike then what do you do
[28:51] if you can't force close then in a way
[28:53] you're you're trusting your channel
[28:54] partner a lot so I think I think we need
[28:57] to keep staying creative that's why I'm
[29:00] uh more open than some others maybe to
[29:02] Solutions like Arc and other types of
[29:04] solutions that take take the great parts
[29:07] of Bitcoin and you know reconfigure the
[29:11] trade-offs a little bit so that maybe
[29:12] there's you know it seems like there's
[29:14] there's kind of a diametric opposition
[29:17] sometimes between convenience and and
[29:20] sovereignty and I think we need more and
[29:22] more people experimenting and really
[29:25] really being honest with ourselves like
[29:27] can you have you know can you hand this
[29:28] to somebody that doesn't understand
[29:30] Bitcoin and have it work properly like
[29:32] that is that is a challenge it's not an
[29:35] easy challenge I think I think we got to
[29:37] keep pushing as a community for those
[29:39] types of solutions so in my case I'm
[29:41] more of you know an application
[29:43] developer I'm more of you know a buyer
[29:45] and uh user of these services and you
[29:47] know I know what I'm doing to some
[29:49] extent but uh I think you know for me
[29:52] even I'm I'm researching this from the
[29:54] the Eye of somebody that's going to try
[29:56] to interface with cascader services is
[29:58] how do they get set up I I think it is
[30:00] still a challenge to the point where
[30:01] it's you know I do need Fiat rails for
[30:04] for the normies in the world because a
[30:06] lot of what I build is not just for
[30:07] bitcoiners it's for normies as well but
[30:10] I do try to I do try to consider the
[30:11] bitcoiners and figure out you know how
[30:14] to um how to make the best possible
[30:15] experience for them as well I partnered
[30:18] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[30:21] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[30:24] saw created by anyone look at that
[30:27] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[30:30] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[30:33] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[30:36] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[30:39] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[30:42] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[30:45] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:49] watch collections you have the date of
[30:51] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[30:54] there and of course also the block
[30:56] height and which aepo we are currently
[31:00] in I love the level of detail they put
[31:02] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[31:05] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[31:08] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[31:11] love those watches so so much if you
[31:14] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:16] regular basis I'll guess you already
[31:18] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[31:21] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[31:24] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[31:27] personal recommendation for hardare
[31:28] wallet is the bit box it's super secure
[31:31] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[31:33] gift for a friend who has still the
[31:36] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[31:39] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[31:42] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[31:46] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[31:49] to really level up your sovereignty as
[31:51] an individual you have to have the most
[31:54] secure self custody setup you have to
[31:56] secure your own devices you have to
[31:59] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:02] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:04] where you live you even want to have a
[32:07] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:10] in case something goes really really
[32:11] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:13] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:16] by step and if you visit the bitcoin.com
[32:21] partners Robin you even get a 30 minute
[32:24] free call to find out how you can level
[32:27] up your
[32:28] sovereignty I believe uh really big time
[32:31] into the positive development that
[32:36] Bitcoin Community will bring to the
[32:38] scaling of Bitcoin because it's
[32:41] essential to the Bitcoin future that we
[32:43] can also spend it there are some
[32:46] proponents of like ah let's let's leave
[32:48] Bitcoin as a store of value no I I think
[32:50] it's crucial to have it as a mean of
[32:52] exchange and as a unit of account and to
[32:54] be able to to exchange it uh Al Al with
[32:58] micro payments micro payments are huge
[33:00] for me um how do you actually how do you
[33:04] see micro payments changing the world if
[33:07] we all of the sudden can pay for Netflix
[33:10] per hour that we watch or something like
[33:13] that like how do you see micro payments
[33:16] maybe changing the way our society or
[33:18] especially our
[33:20] economics uh could could work and moving
[33:23] away from maybe this monthly
[33:24] subscription model that's kind of
[33:26] everywhere now yeah I think it makes the
[33:28] economics much different and probably
[33:30] much more fair and lower cost so as you
[33:34] point out if you just pay per call which
[33:36] is what cascader does then you know a
[33:38] lot of the times you'll end up spending
[33:39] less and you'll you'll pay for what you
[33:41] use and so it's more of a fair value
[33:43] forv value exchange so that's on the buy
[33:46] side and then on the sell side it's
[33:47] really interesting because now no matter
[33:49] where you are whether you know I'm in
[33:51] the United States but if you're in India
[33:53] if you're in Africa I can collaborate
[33:55] with you I can just show you my docs say
[33:57] hey this is how this is how you set up a
[33:59] service go ahead go ahead and run it and
[34:02] we'll you know route you route inbound
[34:04] to you we we'll route uh business to you
[34:06] and now on the cell side you know that
[34:08] makes that makes entrepreneurship so
[34:10] much easier and I think that that is
[34:13] essential for ensuring that AI knowledge
[34:16] and AI systems and competence
[34:18] decentralizes and that we have you know
[34:21] good array of you know all the talents
[34:23] that the world has to offer not just
[34:26] where you happen to be born whether or
[34:27] not you happen to be able to get a good
[34:29] credit card or or or bank account it's
[34:32] finally a fair system that includes
[34:35] everyone that basically has access to
[34:38] the internet yeah and that's how it
[34:40] should be and even outside there's uh
[34:44] how is it called Machan Cura or
[34:46] something like that in in Africa that
[34:48] allows you to to to use uh the the
[34:51] messages to to buy and sell Bitcoin and
[34:54] receive it I mean obviously do you trust
[34:56] them then but yeah it's it's is that are
[34:58] you talking about empa I think that's
[35:00] what you're talking about I I I heard
[35:05] much yeah and you know the whole it's
[35:08] it's funny you know the whole banking
[35:09] system in Africa as many have pointed
[35:11] out has has remnants of the colonial
[35:14] order you know it makes it harder for
[35:16] them to trade so I think that's
[35:18] absolutely ridiculous I think humans
[35:22] have a right to trade with one another
[35:24] obviously as long as it's uh you know
[35:26] within certain bounds but but I I think
[35:28] that's pretty egregious violation of
[35:30] their rights and that is that is keeping
[35:32] them down and I don't want to see that I
[35:34] want to see everybody move forward and
[35:37] and prosper so I I think that Bitcoin is
[35:40] is Hope Bitcoin is a beautiful
[35:42] opportunity for us to all collaborate
[35:44] and move towards a paradigm where we're
[35:46] all winning and not just cutting each
[35:48] other
[35:49] down yeah was uh I don't know uh what
[35:53] you said but I okay yeah I know that one
[35:57] because it came up I think like two
[35:59] three times already when I had African
[36:01] people on on my show uh and even the I
[36:03] think the found I had also on from from
[36:06] them and it's really interesting that
[36:07] you can just send and receive with like
[36:09] literally any phone uh and uh it's it's
[36:13] something that I never thought about
[36:15] because as a Austrian you don't have
[36:18] that kind of a problem uh do not have
[36:21] internet or do not have bank account
[36:23] because in Austria like
[36:24] 99.999% of the people have a bank
[36:27] account and internet which is a
[36:29] different story in Africa but this is uh
[36:32] super interesting what they're doing uh
[36:35] in in all all that all those regions uh
[36:38] I don't know if you're aware aware of
[36:40] that no I didn't know about this
[36:42] particular one I I I've heard of like
[36:44] impesa or others that I think are
[36:46] probably like this where they use
[36:47] telecoms to facilitate Bitcoin
[36:49] transactions that's that's amazing
[36:51] that's that's an example of that's
[36:54] pretty Cipher Punk that's that's um the
[36:56] direction we should be going so I
[36:57] applaud those people it's it's like an
[37:00] open-source protocol and everyone can
[37:03] interact with that which brings all the
[37:06] creativity of humanity to this one
[37:09] payment layer I I love that like I'm
[37:12] always amazed I have a podcast now with
[37:14] you're my 363rd guest so I'm approaching
[37:17] the 400 guests and it's amaz I'm amazed
[37:21] how much you learn still every
[37:25] day yeah that's amazing I I I think
[37:28] that's the other cool thing about
[37:29] Bitcoin is it is like a roar shock block
[37:32] we all see something different in our
[37:33] own individual way that calls to us and
[37:36] we're able to contribute something
[37:38] different even if it's just you know a
[37:40] new thought or a new idea about what
[37:43] this technology means I think that's one
[37:45] of the more beautiful things about
[37:47] Bitcoin absolutely where would you say
[37:49] are we currently in in the adoption
[37:52] phase I mean there's a lot of talks
[37:53] about uh um uh the uh
[37:58] Bitcoin Reserve in America you you're an
[38:00] American uh there's a lot of talks about
[38:03] micro strategies a lot of the the
[38:04] companies coming in uh but I also really
[38:07] love that we have so much developments
[38:10] in in uh in the code base and there so
[38:12] much developments with like layer
[38:14] Technologies and things like Mar and
[38:16] Kura uh on top of it are we kind of like
[38:19] close to a a big moment like we had
[38:24] maybe compared to the do com bubble uh I
[38:27] mean bubble is maybe not the best
[38:28] comparison but an an event where the
[38:32] developments drastically all of the
[38:34] sudden uh um go faster than they used
[38:37] from adoption like many many people com
[38:40] into the scene or do you see like this
[38:43] slower growth of of
[38:45] Bitcoin yeah I I can't can't say exactly
[38:48] what the future holds but it seems that
[38:49] Bitcoin is going mainstream you have all
[38:51] the corporations and government starting
[38:53] to take an interest a lot of people say
[38:56] well that's not cyppher Punk that's
[38:57] that's not what Bitcoin about is about
[38:59] but remember bitcoin's for enemies so um
[39:02] it really doesn't matter I think I think
[39:04] the only winning game the only winning
[39:06] move is to play this Bitcoin game so
[39:09] it's kind of obvious that they were
[39:10] eventually going to do this I think it's
[39:11] a little earlier than I thought it would
[39:13] be but I'm I'm not mad about it I think
[39:16] um there are a lot of people that you
[39:18] know haven't woken up to bitcoin yet so
[39:20] this type of these types of moves give
[39:23] more legitimacy to bitcoin and now you
[39:24] get a lot more questions about bit coin
[39:27] from people that aren't necessarily
[39:29] counterculture you know crazy people
[39:31] like myself you know they're they're
[39:34] asking these questions from a from a
[39:36] pure business standpoint and from a pure
[39:39] um you know curiosity standpoint so some
[39:42] people that are conformist some some
[39:44] people that's the way they operate and
[39:46] that's not the worst thing but um I I I
[39:48] think
[39:50] that you know what happened in the
[39:52] election with Bitcoin is is pretty
[39:54] amazing you know you have an a Bitcoin
[39:56] president that's openly um you know
[39:59] supporting Bitcoin we'll see if he
[40:01] follow follows through with any of his
[40:02] promises I'm not necessarily holding my
[40:04] breath but I think that's a good thing
[40:05] for bitcoiners because the alternative
[40:07] was pretty pretty dire in my eyes you
[40:09] know I think a lot of the stuff that was
[40:11] happening with the telegram CEO getting
[40:13] arrested the samurai devs Etc that was a
[40:16] massive assault on our first amendment
[40:19] rights on and on Bernstein versus us and
[40:21] I think it's very important that you
[40:23] know while we have friendly
[40:24] administrations that we reclaim this
[40:26] territory and say say no you we are
[40:28] still a free people and we don't we
[40:30] don't allow this type of tyranny so I I
[40:32] think that was incredibly important um
[40:35] but I also take the flip side of you we
[40:38] could get rug pulled who knows what
[40:39] happens you know there could be an
[40:40] attack on bitcoin and I don't think we
[40:42] should be getting too comfortable I
[40:43] think you we have to understand this is
[40:45] a movement more than it is just a a get
[40:48] rich quick scheme it's it's not a um you
[40:51] know number go up is nice but don't get
[40:53] too used to it is kind of the way I
[40:54] think about it yeah we have to stay land
[40:57] and are you concerned that we focus too
[41:00] much on number cop and not Freedom C I
[41:03] think people that have been in this for
[41:05] long enough I think they understand
[41:07] enough that it's not just number go up
[41:09] but I think everyone Falls susceptible
[41:11] to it I think you know especially if
[41:12] you're all in on bitcoin you know you're
[41:15] lying if you're saying that your net
[41:17] worth increasing Forex in the last
[41:20] couple years doesn't affect you at all I
[41:21] think it does affect you I think um you
[41:24] got to stay hard though I think you got
[41:26] to stay hard and a principle to what
[41:28] this is about because fundamentally this
[41:30] is a fight for honesty this is a fight
[41:31] for liberty this is a fight for the
[41:33] future of humanity for Prosperity you
[41:36] you mentioned rackpull it's it's how
[41:38] does this rackpull how how would you
[41:41] imagine this rck bull looking like if am
[41:44] if the American government now comes
[41:46] into the game we have obviously black
[41:48] rock into the game with a lot of Bitcoin
[41:50] already like they I'm I'm impressed how
[41:53] many Bitcoin they were able to
[41:55] accumulate I almost I was surprised
[41:57] how fast this goes uh would what do you
[42:01] mean with
[42:02] rackpull yeah I don't know exactly the
[42:04] way it would take shape some people have
[42:06] discussed the possibility of a fork
[42:08] where you know Black Rock tries to
[42:11] change the supply or otherwise mess with
[42:15] the core code now there's there's a flip
[42:17] side of that is there might be a
[42:18] significant cost to that and there's
[42:20] probably enough hold hodlers at least
[42:22] right now to uh at least preempt the the
[42:25] worst case scenarios but I guess you
[42:27] know no matter what I think there might
[42:29] be a a fight for the future of Bitcoin
[42:31] and bitcoiners have to be comfortable
[42:33] with the fact that that might mean a
[42:35] pretty big draw down in the meantime so
[42:38] so we shouldn't be um that's kind of
[42:40] what I what I mean by don't get too
[42:42] comfortable because I think there's a
[42:44] possibility that something like that
[42:46] takes place and you got to stick to your
[42:47] guns because the alternative is that you
[42:50] totally you know get um get
[42:54] subjugated it's could it be something
[42:56] Sim
[42:57] than we had 2017 with the pl size Wars
[43:01] where a lot of the industry were going
[43:03] towards bigger
[43:04] PLS yeah it could definitely be
[43:06] something like that now how that shakes
[43:08] out I I ideally would think that we win
[43:11] that out um you know the the principled
[43:13] bitcoiners but you know sentiment is a
[43:15] crazy thing when um and you got to keep
[43:19] in mind that the US government or
[43:20] probably a lot of Wall Street is are
[43:22] masters of scops so you have to be aware
[43:25] of that of what you're up against and
[43:28] you know make sure that we're educating
[43:29] especially new individuals that are
[43:31] coming in um that you know really
[43:33] ideally you want to have self custody
[43:35] Bitcoin if you can afford if you can
[43:37] manage it and I think there's a lot of
[43:38] great companies that have been that have
[43:40] been doing that especially like
[43:41] Unchained does a phenomenal job of
[43:43] educating people of what they're
[43:45] actually buying how to actually take
[43:46] care of it responsibly how to actually
[43:49] understand what its value proposition is
[43:51] um and and all the other little tidbits
[43:54] that go into becoming a real bitcoiner
[43:57] self custody is an interesting topic I I
[44:01] one of the rare bitcoiners who have self
[44:03] custody since day one like I didn't
[44:05] understand Bitcoin I kind of thought
[44:07] it's a scam but I wanted to have it to
[44:10] to investigate so I wanted to also buy
[44:13] self custody on day one so I had self
[44:15] custody since I thought Bitcoin is a
[44:18] scam obviously I came came along way
[44:21] here but uh most people need a long time
[44:24] to self custody I was uh even on on some
[44:27] conferences where people ask in the big
[44:29] crowd on bitcoin conferences on on a big
[44:31] crowd like oh how many of you are in
[44:33] self custody and like 50% say no like
[44:36] I'm surprised on how many people don't
[44:39] self custody they they are they they
[44:41] rather have uh some on exchange some on
[44:45] micro strategy stock some ETFs like I
[44:47] I'm I'm surprised Honestly by how Niche
[44:51] self custodies out uh an an Community
[44:54] question on on my YouTube community and
[44:56] I push self- custody uh heavily uh
[45:00] except my watch sponsor all of them are
[45:02] around the topic of self- custody like a
[45:04] hard wallet and the Bitcoin way uh with
[45:07] the services they provide so I push
[45:10] self- custody as as hard as I can and
[45:13] still like a huge percentage of the the
[45:16] people even listening to this probably
[45:18] there are some people that don't solve
[45:20] custody are we how will we succeed to to
[45:24] come to a self custody future or is that
[45:26] something that will not come anyways
[45:29] because we always have for some portion
[45:31] of the people Banks and and
[45:33] intermediaries that take care of the
[45:35] convenience part and they don't get
[45:37] Freedom go up
[45:39] technology yeah you know you're kind of
[45:40] reminding me one of my favorite talks at
[45:43] Bitcoin in Nashville it was a panel
[45:46] between Jimmy song Ben asrin and um and
[45:50] Luke rowski and I'm a big asran fan I'm
[45:53] actually a wrestler uh I was I actually
[45:55] trained with him when I was in high
[45:56] school school so that was kind of fun um
[45:59] and he made a great point about how we
[46:01] live in a world that kind of coddles us
[46:03] right we live in a world where
[46:04] everything's instant everything's
[46:06] convenient it's all instant
[46:07] gratification you don't have to worry
[46:08] about anything you don't have to think
[46:09] too hard but we come you know especially
[46:12] in America we come from Pioneers we come
[46:14] from people that lived or died by their
[46:16] own confidence in the wild west they
[46:18] might get attacked by Native Americans
[46:20] any minute and they might run out of
[46:21] food at any minute so that uh that
[46:25] self-reliance is scary scary but I think
[46:28] it's the natural state of humans I think
[46:29] a lot of the mental health crises people
[46:32] go through is because they don't uh they
[46:34] don't take responsibility for everything
[46:36] that they're you know they should be
[46:38] doing and they're they're kind of
[46:40] wallowing in this uh this world that
[46:42] kind of gets you into dependence this
[46:44] world of public schooling that pulls you
[46:46] in and kind of programs you with apathy
[46:49] Conformity dependence and uh we need to
[46:53] break those chains and I think
[46:54] especially if you're a man especially if
[46:56] you're somebody that um really
[46:58] appreciates how messed up the government
[47:01] is you really shouldn't wait to get into
[47:03] self- custody I think once you h a
[47:05] certain threshold of you know dollar
[47:07] amount it makes tons of sense to grab a
[47:09] hardware wallet it doesn't have to be
[47:11] the top-of-the-line perfect Hardware
[47:13] wallet but I think um it's it's critical
[47:16] that you start to understand these tools
[47:17] and take responsibility for these tools
[47:19] just like your forefathers
[47:22] did is bring is Bitcoin kind of bringing
[47:24] us to a more sovereign
[47:27] um lifestyle back to like more
[47:30] selfreliance and less cuddly but more
[47:34] responsibility on the individual yeah I
[47:36] mean and when you when you think about
[47:38] it you know think about it in even like
[47:40] a feudalistic sense you know what is
[47:43] what are vassals they're people that
[47:45] rely on the king for for their daily
[47:48] bread you know that's where a lot of
[47:49] that stuff comes from so uh dependence
[47:54] may seem like it's a good deal
[47:55] convenience may seem like it's a good
[47:57] deal but in the long run you know it
[47:58] saps you it makes you dependent and now
[48:00] you're relying on somebody else for your
[48:03] daily bread you're you're relying on
[48:05] somebody else for the things that you
[48:07] need in life and I think you know one of
[48:09] the most liberating and beautiful parts
[48:12] of life is when you when you say no when
[48:14] your willpower takes over you say I'm
[48:16] not g to let somebody else be
[48:17] responsible for my success or failure
[48:20] I'm going to live or die by you know the
[48:22] things that made me unique the way that
[48:24] God made me and um and and what I have
[48:27] to contribute to the world and I'm G to
[48:29] I'm going to take full ownership of
[48:31] everything that's super interesting I I
[48:33] love that and I think we're coming to an
[48:36] really Pride future how do you how do
[48:37] you in general as we on that topic how
[48:39] do you in general see the difference
[48:41] between a Bitcoin standard world and the
[48:43] feat standard
[48:44] world yeah you know I've actually
[48:46] thought about you know maybe somebody
[48:48] should write a Sci-Fi book I'm too busy
[48:51] uh trying to make the Sci-Fi reality
[48:52] happen but I I think about this you know
[48:55] there's probably going to be factions
[48:56] that are that are Fiat they're factions
[48:58] that are going to be Bitcoin and I and I
[49:01] think that in the long run it's going to
[49:03] almost bifurcate the species into the
[49:05] two different species you you almost
[49:07] start to look like um you almost start
[49:09] to look like The Time Machine by is that
[49:12] uh HG Wells you know where you have
[49:15] these different species that that evolve
[49:17] out of uh humans and I think that the
[49:20] Bitcoin standard is going to be it's
[49:23] going to be homeschooling it's going to
[49:24] be self- sovereignty it's going to be
[49:26] creativ it's going to be Renaissance men
[49:29] um it's going to be tough tough people
[49:31] it's going to be strong people um and
[49:33] it's going to be kind people hopefully
[49:35] because when you have a low time
[49:36] preference you you know it brings out
[49:38] the best in you it brings out your
[49:40] higher self in a lot of ways and I think
[49:42] the alternative is to live in the Pod
[49:44] eat the bugs and you know uh be
[49:47] manipulated and and and uh hear
[49:50] propaganda every waking M minute
[49:52] basically live in 1984 but probably even
[49:54] more even worse than what we can imagine
[49:56] and uh you know get you know cyber
[49:59] implants or whatever else they make you
[50:01] get and you know basically be a vessel
[50:03] which is you know uh worse than hell and
[50:06] in a lot of ways this you know to me
[50:07] this is a god Mission because I don't
[50:09] think we're meant to live that way I
[50:10] think God imbued us with this dignity
[50:13] that uh that can't be violated and
[50:15] that's that's where why I'm such a big
[50:17] proponent of the Bill of Rights and
[50:19] other civil liberties and of privacy and
[50:22] and self self- sovereignty human
[50:24] flourishing absolutely and I always
[50:27] think about when I talk about those
[50:28] things about Matrix the movie uh it's
[50:32] it's it's it's a perfect anecdote where
[50:35] you you have people that Li love the
[50:38] convenience so much uh they rather are
[50:41] staying there uh but then uh you have
[50:44] the brave people that also go to like I
[50:47] want to be free I I want that and I'm
[50:50] willing to fight that and even willing
[50:52] to trade that for maybe a little bit
[50:55] more in convenient life a little bit
[50:57] more rough life but the freedom and the
[51:00] self- sovereignty and the responsibility
[51:03] is so much more worth than any
[51:05] convenience I can ever get and I know at
[51:08] the end of the day it's the decision
[51:11] that is more true to me and I I love
[51:14] that a lot that that that's really
[51:16] amazing that's why I cannot look at
[51:17] Matrix I always when I when I look at
[51:19] that movie for 4 minutes I go so
[51:21] motivated and stand up and work
[51:24] more yeah I think every day we're based
[51:27] with sort of micro choices of do we
[51:29] accept the comforting lie or do we do we
[51:31] take the the the hard truth and I think
[51:34] if we're being honest with ourselves
[51:35] we're not always picking you know the
[51:37] hard truth and I think it just comes
[51:39] down to a matter of you know how often
[51:40] are you able to do that and are you able
[51:42] to keep it real and keep moving forward
[51:44] and keep um taking the low time
[51:47] preference approach of making the better
[51:49] choice and the the more realistic Choice
[51:52] over time you know one of the books that
[51:54] I've read recently that I really enjoy
[51:57] was uh the 50th law by Robert Green so
[52:00] if you're familiar with Robert Green he
[52:01] wrote the 48 Laws of Power he draws from
[52:05] a very deep well of historical knowledge
[52:08] and understanding how all these social
[52:10] dynamics work and he uses them to kind
[52:12] of illustrate you know psychological
[52:14] effects and and social dynamics in a way
[52:17] that's I think really insightful I don't
[52:19] think he's always right about everything
[52:21] uh as no one no one typically is but uh
[52:24] I he he collaborated with 50 Cent which
[52:26] you look at 50 say you say oh he's a
[52:28] degenerate you know he parties he's a
[52:30] gambler he was a drug dealer Etc you got
[52:32] to appreciate the guy what his parent
[52:34] you know both his parents were gone when
[52:35] he was eight years old he got raised by
[52:37] his grandparents who barely had any time
[52:39] for him so he basically made a made a
[52:41] choice very early in his life you know
[52:44] these streets are hard and I'm gonna I'm
[52:45] gonna self- rely and he chose to be
[52:48] fearless and to to um you know have you
[52:52] have like a I don't know how how you
[52:54] would say it but just like an intense
[52:56] sense of of realism and and U making the
[52:59] most of what you have and he was able to
[53:00] do that and so when you see people like
[53:02] that even if you don't necessarily agree
[53:04] with every choice they've made you can
[53:06] appreciate the fact that they're you
[53:08] know they're living on a knife's edge
[53:09] and they're they're really pushing um to
[53:11] be all they can be and he ended up
[53:13] getting out ah it's interesting I I was
[53:15] yesterday at a small um uh meet up with
[53:19] friends uh who are a little bit into
[53:22] Bitcoin but not too deep and uh one of
[53:25] them was not into Bitcoin he brought up
[53:27] an interesting point against Bitcoin
[53:28] which I thought like how can you bring
[53:30] up that against Bitcoin but he made
[53:32] exactly the point isn't it really bad
[53:35] that you can lose all your Bitcoin that
[53:37] you have all the power that there is no
[53:40] one uh watching uh what your
[53:42] transactions going and stuff like that
[53:44] like basically all the freedom go up
[53:47] things that we get from Bitcoin he
[53:49] brought up as negative uh so I'm like oh
[53:52] like okay so so you want um a mom always
[53:55] above you and saying like oh son don't
[53:58] do this trans like at some point you
[54:00] want to grow up right it's fine if
[54:02] you're like 8 years old you you need
[54:04] some guidance you need a mom and a dad
[54:06] in your life but at some point you
[54:08] should be an ad and thinking like oh
[54:10] like no I want responsibility I want
[54:11] that freedom I want that um uh
[54:14] responsibility and and empowerment for
[54:17] myself and want to decide okay if I make
[54:20] a transaction wrong there's no way to
[54:22] get it back it's it's my responsibility
[54:25] my decision
[54:26] uh and and also my power and with that
[54:30] power comes a lot of more responsibility
[54:31] and I don't know if if most people are
[54:33] ready for
[54:34] that I feel not yeah I think you bring
[54:38] up a really good point about essentially
[54:39] you know that's a paradigm that CG Yung
[54:42] covered that's the edle mother complex
[54:45] where you're constantly trying to create
[54:47] dependence and and um and kind of keep
[54:49] people down and I think that's really
[54:51] pathological and I think it goes back to
[54:53] once again public schooling which you
[54:56] know for those of you that haven't
[54:58] checked it out I would if you're Liberty
[54:59] mind I would check out the school sucks
[55:01] podcast they basically go into the
[55:03] history of how all this stuff works and
[55:05] how basically the prussians got their
[55:07] asses kicked by Napoleon they said all
[55:09] right what do we got to do to make our
[55:11] guys you know you know enthusiastically
[55:13] run into gunfire and not away from it
[55:15] let's get them when they're five you
[55:17] know and that's where all this comes
[55:18] from and other governments saw that
[55:20] happen and kind of adopted this model
[55:22] but I think it creates all these
[55:24] pathologies I think that and I probably
[55:27] alluded to it earlier but the
[55:28] pathologies you get from public
[55:29] schooling the four key Le lessons are
[55:32] apathy Conformity obedience and
[55:34] dependence and those are you know it's
[55:36] basically slave training so I think that
[55:39] uh it's incumbent on us as bitcoiners
[55:41] and as as free people to fight those
[55:43] Trends and to debate those topics as you
[55:46] I'm sure did with your friend I think
[55:48] this need for you know mother watching
[55:51] over you at all times is um is
[55:54] pathological excuse me
[55:57] is
[55:58] pathological um but so is the flip you
[56:00] know the flip side of just being a total
[56:01] Lone Wolf is probably pathological too I
[56:03] think there's a happy medium where you
[56:05] have a community around you that you
[56:07] support that mutually supports you but
[56:09] um not completely relying on you know
[56:12] the government which is a pretty
[56:13] impersonal way of doing that you know
[56:15] the government governments around the
[56:17] world have kind of done a good job of
[56:19] subverting communities of subing Faith
[56:22] um and and creating this you know
[56:25] atomized Society that's that's right for
[56:27] the taking and so that's why you know
[56:29] religion Community Etc is always an
[56:31] enemy of you know totalitarian regimes
[56:34] so when I hear things like that um you
[56:36] know it makes me nervous but also at the
[56:38] same time not to uh not to hate on
[56:41] Europe too much but I think there's a
[56:42] much more collectivist bent in Europe
[56:45] and that's um that's something that we
[56:47] we need to fight against I'm I'm hopeful
[56:49] that we're able to lead the way and show
[56:52] you know how um a sensible form of
[56:55] individualism and
[56:57] um and in in prosperity can influence
[57:01] things for the better but I I I am I am
[57:04] nervous when I hear stuff like that from
[57:05] Europeans that are just just totally
[57:07] drinking the Kool-Aid of
[57:10] collectivism I I hear uh I laugh at
[57:13] about
[57:15] America and uh it's it's it's
[57:18] unfortunate but I feel like uh actually
[57:21] uh there's a big shift I feel like
[57:23] happening where the the political
[57:26] parties and the the the moods against
[57:30] the European Union against the the all
[57:34] those things that come from from that
[57:37] collectivism uh from that European uh
[57:40] fings also I think those are kind of
[57:42] getting stronger over time uh and I I
[57:46] definitely hope that's the case like I I
[57:49] hope that people are waking up and yeah
[57:51] maybe that's just my optimistic hopeful
[57:53] thinking but we will see uh how it
[57:56] shakes up I
[57:57] definitely try try to do my best here in
[58:00] Europe and and infiltrate with Bitcoin
[58:04] thinking with freedom mind thinking it's
[58:06] also one thing because uh a lot of
[58:08] people say like oh why are you still
[58:10] living in the EU like yeah like if
[58:12] everyone
[58:13] leaves uh you will be a really bad place
[58:16] and maybe we can turn this um beautiful
[58:19] con uh beautiful Europe around because
[58:22] Europe is really beautiful to live I
[58:24] like oh it's Europe is great to live but
[58:26] it's it's it's really bad with with
[58:28] taxes it's really bad when you look at
[58:30] from uh founding a company when you look
[58:33] at from a mindset perspect perspective
[58:36] and all those things and Investments and
[58:38] stuff like that but yeah if it's great
[58:41] to live here we should fix the other
[58:43] things otherwise the other things will
[58:45] also go away long term so I I'm I'm
[58:48] still hopeful for Europe I'm I'm still
[58:51] here uh if I see no more hope I'm also
[58:54] gone like I'm I'm not staying uh D die
[58:58] in a place where they don't appreciate
[59:01] uh the P of Freedom if they do if they
[59:05] moving in the right direction uh I I
[59:08] definitely am a big European fan yeah
[59:11] I'm curious what um you know what Spurs
[59:14] your confidence like like based on an
[59:16] anecdotal level like just maybe the
[59:17] types of interactions you're having you
[59:19] know one some of the cues in the United
[59:21] States that things were turning around
[59:23] were you know you had people that are
[59:24] typically more aligned with the left
[59:26] start to align more with you know the
[59:27] center right and you also had just
[59:30] anecdotally like you know if you walked
[59:33] around with a trump shirt in 2016 you
[59:35] might get stabbed but if you walk around
[59:37] with a trump shirt in 2024 you might get
[59:39] a high five like it's the climate has
[59:42] changed
[59:43] significantly um and and so I'm just
[59:45] curious like on that like ground you
[59:48] know Grassroots level what are you
[59:49] seeing that makes you more hopeful that
[59:51] things are turning around actually got
[59:54] the same thing um for ex Austria uh the
[59:58] I watch politics in Austria really
[60:00] closely because it impacts the policies
[60:03] in Austria and the policies in Austria
[60:06] impact me personally and my business um
[60:09] so I'm trying to look at that as close
[60:12] as I can and in Austria is a trend which
[60:16] is also currently happening in Germany
[60:19] uh Germany has uh a government that now
[60:23] step back that's why they have a
[60:25] re-election now
[60:26] uh and the current government which is
[60:28] extremely left uh leaning uh they had
[60:32] when they went into the the the term
[60:36] around 60% of all votes now they don't
[60:39] even have 30% or the free parties that
[60:42] are involved in in in that uh I I get
[60:46] the numbers are roughly like they're not
[60:48] exact uh and now they have re-election
[60:51] because basically the government doesn't
[60:52] have the support of the people anymore
[60:54] and uh the right uh conservative party
[60:59] uh
[61:00] IFD by the way the the IFD leader uh is
[61:04] now officially I think endorsed by Il
[61:07] musk also okay which is an interesting
[61:10] thing there's like a they made an online
[61:13] uh conversation on like a few days ago
[61:16] like four or five days ago I think I
[61:18] caught some of that yeah yeah yeah that
[61:20] that's basically uh I mean her her
[61:22] English was pretty bad I was surprised
[61:25] how bad but I it's it's okay it's
[61:26] authentic I guess um but yeah that's
[61:31] some of the things where I'm like okay
[61:32] that that's interesting in Germany
[61:35] Austria actually have it even a little
[61:38] bit better I would say where the
[61:40] right-wing conservative party got the
[61:42] most votes the last election for the
[61:45] first time ever they never were on top
[61:48] they were always like a 15 20% party and
[61:50] now they are almost at 30% sometimes in
[61:53] the BS they are now getting 35% which is
[61:56] a big thing in Austria because we have
[61:59] five parties so if you get 35% you are
[62:03] leading with like 10 points or something
[62:04] like that uh and if you look at for
[62:09] example with what parties do uh which
[62:12] parties want lower taxes and which
[62:14] parties want higher taxes uh which
[62:17] parties are then elected if you have to
[62:20] the if you combine the three parties in
[62:22] Austria that want lower taxes uh they
[62:25] have a super ma maity they have like 60
[62:27] 65% now uh and actually uh the other
[62:31] ones only have the other perc like 35%
[62:34] something like that and uh those are
[62:38] small hopeful cues that I can get where
[62:42] uh the the right conservative uh parties
[62:45] even though I don't agree with
[62:47] everything they're doing um get more so
[62:50] the the parties that uh argue against a
[62:53] bigger State and want the smaller State
[62:55] they are parties that argue for Less
[62:58] taxes not new taxes and higher taxes uh
[63:02] they get more votes the the parties that
[63:05] are speaking up against those mind
[63:08] viruses of oh like let's let's have like
[63:11] 55 genders and let's uh find people if
[63:15] they don't gender right like yeah like
[63:17] you can be whatever you want to be but
[63:19] don't put it on me that that that's not
[63:22] fine I feel like and so like those
[63:24] parties I feel like like are or like
[63:27] it's it's you can see it in the votes
[63:31] are getting stronger uh and in a lot of
[63:34] ways Europe is usually a few years
[63:37] behind
[63:39] America uh with with technology with
[63:41] Innovation but also with politics
[63:43] actually uh so I hope that what's now
[63:47] happening with Bitcoin and freedom in
[63:50] America might also swap over in the next
[63:53] few years to to Europe um again I'm a
[63:58] absolute Optimist I'm always seeing the
[64:00] hopeful things in things that might be a
[64:03] strength or weakness in me uh but I'm
[64:05] aware of it at least uh so take it with
[64:08] a grain of salts take it with uh however
[64:11] you want to take it but I do have I do
[64:13] have hope for for the things and uh I'm
[64:17] I'm I hope that Europe comes to a uh
[64:20] better
[64:21] conclusion that was a great like
[64:23] macroscopic overview but I'm I'm really
[64:25] curi curious like to hear almost like on
[64:27] the pleb like individual interaction
[64:30] level you know maybe the types of
[64:31] Transformations you saw in people like
[64:34] I've I've certainly met people who are
[64:36] pretty gung-ho against Trump or against
[64:39] at least against you know the Kennedy
[64:41] types and they've they've shifted
[64:43] they've seen that you know the
[64:45] alternative is um is totalitarian in a
[64:48] lot of ways and and as you point out you
[64:50] know forcing the the gendering of people
[64:52] onto you and other other components that
[64:55] just nickel and dime you until you're
[64:56] you're basically have all your rights
[64:58] Stripped Away so I'm just curious like
[65:00] any kind of interactions you have with
[65:02] people you don't have to say their names
[65:03] but like what's going on in people in
[65:05] the
[65:06] individual I have one really interesting
[65:08] one um my uh small cousin which I'm most
[65:14] proud of uh he's super young and so like
[65:17] the generation uh the younger generation
[65:21] five six years ago was completely into
[65:24] the screen things like even like three
[65:26] years ago uh where they I don't know if
[65:29] that was also what do was this a thing
[65:31] in America also we had in Europe people
[65:34] that clued themsel to the
[65:39] street
[65:41] generation
[65:43] traffic okay yeah yeah yeah I mean that
[65:46] was all the rage in
[65:47] 2020 yeah absolutely so this was also an
[65:50] America thing like they also clued
[65:52] themselves on America
[65:53] streets yeah there's a lot of people
[65:55] that would protest by stand in the
[65:57] middle of streets and you know people
[65:59] make the points like okay we get that
[66:00] you're upset about
[66:02] something go ahead and protest but also
[66:05] there could be a pregnant woman in one
[66:06] of these cars there could be somebody
[66:07] that got just got shot in one of these
[66:08] cars let's let's uh clear these and I
[66:11] think it just kind of It kind of kind of
[66:14] shows like a sense of narcissism and
[66:15] entitlement that's that's a little a
[66:17] bridge to yeah and and uh those were
[66:19] really strong a few years ago and I feel
[66:22] like they are getting less and less
[66:25] strong
[66:26] and uh as I mentioned the cousin of mine
[66:29] uh exactly that gener generation even
[66:32] younger than me 5 years younger than me
[66:34] because I'm just 26 he's like yeah six
[66:36] years younger than me he's exactly 20
[66:38] now um he's speaking up against that
[66:41] he's really big on that and he made that
[66:43] uh shift completely and there are
[66:46] multiple persons that I know that
[66:50] are that that are shifting a little bit
[66:53] they're not huge transformation from
[66:55] like they clue themselves on the street
[66:57] and all of the sudden now they are like
[66:59] uh full Trump supporters so so like not
[67:03] stop not stuff like that um but I feel
[67:06] like it gets way more accepted now and
[67:10] there's one big cave always with that
[67:14] that's why I try to get uh things with
[67:16] voting and stuff like that because I
[67:19] have an
[67:21] personal uh
[67:23] subjective uh real that I am in I have a
[67:27] basically a subjective bubble that I
[67:30] live in and the bubble as as the years
[67:33] go on kind of enforc it itself because I
[67:36] have strong and stronger beliefs so
[67:38] naturally I push people out I disagree
[67:40] with and bring people in that I agree
[67:43] with so I'm I'm kind of cautious to
[67:47] bring up personal things because that
[67:50] could just be me building my own
[67:53] personal bubble more and more
[67:56] um so that's why I like to look at okay
[67:59] what is mainstream media actually saying
[68:01] um and not just my my Twitter feed
[68:04] because if mainstream media all of the
[68:05] sudden is kind of
[68:07] promoting uh more conservative uh things
[68:11] more more Bitcoin things also like it's
[68:13] also interesting okay which media
[68:15] Outlets are now all of the sudden
[68:16] switching more and more to bitcoin and
[68:18] thinking bringing actually nice
[68:19] education and not just like those things
[68:22] on there then I feel like there's a
[68:24] shift happening
[68:26] and I can I can sense that on a small
[68:28] level but with like my
[68:31] personal relationships I'm really really
[68:34] really cautious always because as I said
[68:37] I met yesterday friends that I haven't
[68:39] met in a long time and they I met the
[68:42] whole other uh stories where I'm like oh
[68:45] what's happening
[68:46] here what the heck like how can you have
[68:49] that uh so uh I'm I'm cautious with uh
[68:54] talking about your own
[68:56] personal
[68:58] bubble yeah it's hard not to over index
[69:01] you know I'm at the Bitcoin coms I'm at
[69:03] pleb lab like every day so a lot of my
[69:05] the circle that I'm surrounded by
[69:07] already kind of agrees with me so
[69:08] sometimes I'm like I don't even know
[69:10] what's going on in the real world I'm
[69:11] just gonna not pay too much attention
[69:14] but I think there were signs you know
[69:16] before the election happened that it
[69:18] would go the way it did it it was just
[69:20] uh you know the level of enthusiasm was
[69:22] just much different you know as I
[69:24] honestly like right near a gay parade
[69:26] which is kind of surprising you know and
[69:27] everybody was like yeah y would you
[69:29] agree like this is this is a travesty
[69:32] what's going on in the United States and
[69:33] I think you know a lot of this stuff I
[69:35] think it comes down to Common Sense it
[69:38] comes down to you know the 2020 the
[69:41] early 2020 subsidized nonsense if you
[69:44] think about all these low or negative
[69:47] interest rates unless you just pour
[69:48] money at whatever yeah sure well yeah
[69:50] you want to go do whatever you know
[69:53] whatever dumb project you want to do you
[69:55] want to do whatever fake renewable
[69:56] project that doesn't actually make money
[69:59] you want to go do whatever fake cultural
[70:00] project that isn't actually uh subsi go
[70:03] ahead here you go here's some free money
[70:05] I just printed it for you um you that
[70:07] was a lot easier and I'm I'm um somewhat
[70:10] partial to Tom Longo's analysis that you
[70:13] know a lot of the a lot of the fake
[70:15] money um that was out there to to fund
[70:18] you know possibly fun protests or or
[70:20] other types of energy you know it's just
[70:22] not there it doesn't hit the same when
[70:25] you're not doing as well at your you
[70:27] know your your woke job and you have to
[70:30] you know live in the real world and
[70:32] you're you're not like getting your your
[70:34] your lifestyle is not getting subsidized
[70:36] by fake money so I think that's almost
[70:38] like a taste of what hyperbitcoinization
[70:40] will be like but probably on steroids
[70:42] it'll get even more intense to the point
[70:44] where um you know even people in in Wall
[70:47] Street that have kind of fake jobs that
[70:49] shouldn't exist like like Forex Trading
[70:51] which probably shouldn't exist under a
[70:53] Bitcoin standard you know those types of
[70:54] things are going to not be subsidized
[70:57] anymore and now people are going to have
[70:58] to go out there and actually create
[71:00] value and I think that's that's a
[71:01] beautiful thing for the world it'll be
[71:03] painful for those people in the short
[71:05] term and I certainly would would want to
[71:06] help rehabilitate them but I think we
[71:08] can't live in a world like that where
[71:10] there's just this level of exploitation
[71:12] and and subsidy that um isn't align with
[71:15] reality and with what people actually
[71:16] need in order to create human
[71:19] flourishing do do you think that Bitcoin
[71:22] uh could break that vicious cycle you
[71:25] you 100% notice things like uh weak man
[71:29] great bad uh great tough times tough
[71:32] times great strong man strong man and in
[71:35] that cycle you're probably aware of
[71:37] could that cycle be broken with Bitcoin
[71:40] or is that or are we just in a right
[71:42] time of the cycle where we get tougher
[71:44] and that's why it creates bigger things
[71:46] there's a reason that quote exists and
[71:48] it's because there's something in a in
[71:50] human human nature and it's um it's hard
[71:53] to stay stoic it's when things are going
[71:56] really good it's easy to get
[71:58] overconfident when things are going
[71:59] really bad it's easy to be blackpilled
[72:01] and miss the opportunities right in
[72:03] front of you and so kind of going back
[72:05] to um that book I mentioned the 50th law
[72:08] about 50 Cent that's one of the things I
[72:10] you know respected about uh him and
[72:12] about that book was they talk about you
[72:14] know just just having an intense sense
[72:16] of realism and not missing you know when
[72:18] things are going bad not getting down
[72:20] but but hyperfocusing on the opportunity
[72:23] that's right in front of you you know
[72:24] that's what means to be a hard man in a
[72:27] lot of ways and then on the flip side
[72:28] don't get overconfident don't uh
[72:30] overplay your hand when you're when
[72:32] things are going well keep in mind that
[72:34] things can change in an instant and any
[72:36] time that you need to um you know you
[72:39] need to you need to have a backup plan
[72:41] you need to treat people with respect
[72:42] because I think that's a lot of what it
[72:43] comes down to is um you get high and
[72:46] mighty and you you lose sight of other
[72:48] people's dignity and of um of reality
[72:51] man it was published almost on my
[72:52] birthday uh 9th of September my birthday
[72:56] oh that's my dad's birthday nice oh
[72:58] interesting yes you're very just for the
[73:02] the the the five people that didn't knew
[73:04] that uh popular uh quote here is Hard
[73:08] Times great strong man strong man great
[73:10] good times good times great weekman and
[73:13] weak man great Hard Times H it's it's
[73:17] it's a it's a it's a good one I love
[73:19] that one but yeah 50 of law by 50 I
[73:22] wasn't aware that 50 Cent and Robert
[73:24] Green uh wrote a book together that that
[73:27] that mix itself makes the book
[73:29] interesting honestly yeah it's an Odd
[73:32] Couple and you know he talks about how
[73:34] you know they had met together and he he
[73:36] W you know Robert WR writes the forward
[73:38] and says you know I was I was quite
[73:40] surprised by how much we had in common
[73:42] and you know part of me was like hey
[73:44] maybe you know maybe 50 c paid him to
[73:46] write all these nice things and I and I
[73:47] think there's probably an element to
[73:49] that but it wasn't just you know I
[73:51] expected to get 250 pages of mostly ass
[73:53] kissing and that's not what I got I did
[73:56] I did see um it was it was a genuine
[74:00] insightful Robert Green book that draws
[74:03] upon not just 50 cents experience but a
[74:05] lot of other historical uh you know
[74:08] historical figures experiences and and
[74:10] how to uh how to navigate those just the
[74:13] first chapter just hit me right in the
[74:14] face it's it's some of the themes I've
[74:16] talked about but I could probably reread
[74:18] that a hundred times and still not glean
[74:20] all of U all the value out of it it's a
[74:23] is a really well done book I was quite
[74:25] impressed that's why I feel comfortable
[74:27] recommending
[74:28] it yeah I feel like Robert
[74:32] Ken I mean I don't know him but I heard
[74:35] things about him he doesn't strike me as
[74:37] the person that is easily just paid out
[74:40] I mean he also is well off and I don't
[74:43] know if if if that could even be the
[74:46] case probably it was for almost everyone
[74:49] there's a number yeah and a lot of
[74:51] people have criticized him because
[74:52] they're like oh look at him he's a nerd
[74:54] like he's not a con conventionally
[74:55] strong man and maybe some of that's true
[74:57] but I you know got to tip your hat to
[74:59] him he wrote a bestseller that you know
[75:01] took him from basically being being a
[75:04] nobody to being like one of the best you
[75:06] know best well recognized authors uh
[75:09] ever so that's something and then the
[75:11] flip side is you know I look at the
[75:12] world like this some people are like
[75:14] Phil Jackson maybe they're not the best
[75:17] uh performer or player uh you know for
[75:21] those of you that know Phil Jackson was
[75:22] the coach of the Chicago Bulls when they
[75:24] won like championships you know he
[75:26] wasn't as good as Michael Jordan but he
[75:28] was a damn good coach and some people
[75:30] are like that some people maybe they
[75:31] can't necessarily perform in the same
[75:33] way um as what they're espousing but
[75:36] they still give good advice and that's
[75:37] why they're a good coach and they're
[75:39] they're worth listening
[75:40] to absolutely and we already uh I hope I
[75:44] hope you have time because we are very
[75:45] close to all of all uh to the end of of
[75:48] end of it um but one more topic I want
[75:50] to get into um you you said in the
[75:53] beginning and we touched on it a little
[75:55] bit uh that that you might be
[75:59] paranoid that that that because of the
[76:01] security and the privacy of aspect of it
[76:04] um do you think that we bitcoiners have
[76:07] like a good reason of of that paranoia
[76:10] paranoia that we have that that like all
[76:12] like we have to have like the three out
[76:14] of five uh
[76:17] multi-continental self- cust setup is is
[76:20] that like uh like how how do you look at
[76:22] that yeah you know I think sometimes
[76:25] only the paranoid survive I think
[76:26] there's a reason for it I mean you can't
[76:28] let it eat you inside I think there's a
[76:30] place for it that has to be checked but
[76:32] at the same time you know Bitcoin is
[76:34] fundamentally about restoring honesty
[76:36] and trust to the world and that trust
[76:38] has been violated over and over again we
[76:40] look at the Genesis block and that's
[76:41] perfect proof of that right um and and
[76:44] so the flip side of that is you know
[76:46] look evaluating your entire life where
[76:48] am I trusting when I should be verifying
[76:50] one is one example is what operating
[76:52] system you choose to use for your your
[76:55] desktop computer if you're using Linux
[76:57] you're you're more on the verify side if
[76:59] you're using uh Mac or or especially
[77:03] Windows you're you know you're giving up
[77:05] your sovereignty Windows you know even
[77:07] even uh had to pull back on their whole
[77:09] plan of screenshotting your your screen
[77:12] you know every X seconds which I think
[77:14] is egregious violation right but then it
[77:16] comes back to health as well you know a
[77:18] lot of these Concepts that we've um
[77:21] taken for granted are are are being
[77:22] challenged you know I'm actually sitting
[77:24] across I I live across the street from
[77:26] this place called the sapen center which
[77:28] is pretty big on the uh on a lot of the
[77:31] health sovereignty stuff in terms of you
[77:33] know carnivore diet the meat Mafia guys
[77:36] uh spoke there in at the H we had a
[77:38] havening party over there and it was
[77:40] great it's the whole Bitcoin Community
[77:42] but we had the meat Mafia guys talk
[77:44] about how they changed their entire
[77:45] lives by just re-evaluating you know
[77:48] what if I remove inflammatory stuff from
[77:50] my diet well what's the least
[77:52] inflammatory thing I can do I can
[77:53] consume red meat and they found that you
[77:55] know gives them a certain you know Vigor
[77:58] um and and uh if you look at those guys
[78:00] you know their health kind of speaks for
[78:01] itself one of them was able to cure like
[78:04] a digestive problem just by um sticking
[78:07] to anti-inflammatory foods like red
[78:09] meats uh and and also you know at that
[78:11] com at that um talk there was Matthew
[78:14] leack who who wrote the book Fiat food I
[78:17] don't know if you're familiar with that
[78:18] he published it under
[78:20] saine's uh publishing house but he he
[78:23] basically brings the receipts of all all
[78:25] that we relied to about the the about
[78:28] nutrition just for you know government
[78:31] corruption per you know uh corporate
[78:33] profits and and even religious ellot uh
[78:36] personal gain and it and it and it
[78:38] messed up an entire generation go look
[78:40] at a picture of an American at the beach
[78:42] in 1970 versus right now it's a it's a
[78:45] total um it's it's so that that trust
[78:48] has been violated on the diet level so
[78:49] we got the money level we got the you
[78:52] know computer uh you know operating
[78:54] system level we got the diet level so I
[78:56] would just I would just encourage
[78:57] everybody to just you know audit your
[79:00] whole life and just think about you know
[79:01] where am I where am I placing undue
[79:03] trust and where can I do better to you
[79:05] look out for me and my family's
[79:07] well-being absolutely and I just want to
[79:09] bring it quickly up uh I I had Matthew
[79:13] luia calls on on my channel four months
[79:16] ago actually uh so that was a really
[79:19] good one and this was one of my videos
[79:22] where I kind of was disappointed
[79:25] in myself because I I thought it's such
[79:29] a great conversation and I didn't do a
[79:32] good enough job to promoting it that's
[79:34] why I got a low very low vion uh for for
[79:37] my videos H and I felt
[79:39] bad for me and from Matthew because I
[79:42] was like oh like that that that video
[79:44] was really good and deserves more Vi so
[79:46] like if you like that video like you you
[79:49] will like that vide a lot uh so just
[79:52] check it out uh and uh that that's
[79:55] something I can highly recommend Matthew
[79:58] is really an interesting guy to to
[80:00] listen to and and he really LS it out uh
[80:04] extremely nicely on on how fat food is
[80:07] working and how is fat poisoning our
[80:09] food and there's a big controversial
[80:11] thing actually with like plant-based
[80:13] versus carnivore in the Bitcoin
[80:15] Community I wasn't aware that the
[80:18] plantbased community within Bitcoin is
[80:20] so big uh I met a lot of them even like
[80:23] in person but there are a lot of um uh
[80:27] things that both communities really
[80:30] combine uh that also Matthew speaks
[80:32] towards like the processed food things
[80:34] like everyone can agree that processed
[80:36] food is not good uh no matter if it's
[80:39] like a meat or
[80:41] like even worse and and a plant-based
[80:45] meat thing chemical thing where it looks
[80:48] like a burger tastes like a burger but
[80:49] it's nothing like a burger uh so and
[80:52] like fresh food and whole food and stuff
[80:54] like that
[80:55] uh but and yeah like uh Matthew did a
[80:58] really good job in in explaining what
[81:00] FIA does to our food supplies and how
[81:02] important the the Food suppliers are in
[81:04] in in that whole game so I highly
[81:06] recommend checking that out I fully
[81:08] agree with you
[81:10] here yeah I got the chance to meet
[81:12] Matthew and hang out with him after the
[81:14] the show and just and just chop it up
[81:16] and you sign some of my books and yeah I
[81:19] mean just just after H having seen that
[81:21] you know it's like putting on the
[81:23] glasses from um from they live you know
[81:26] you're you look at the food and it's not
[81:29] real food it's it's uh it's got motor
[81:31] oils in it it's the seed oils are you
[81:34] know one-way ticket to met being
[81:36] metabolically metabolically compromised
[81:38] and that's changed the way I eat and
[81:40] change the way I look at things so um
[81:43] you know how could you possibly expect
[81:45] yourself to be firing in all cylinders
[81:47] if you're if you're putting poison in
[81:48] your body and so that just goes back to
[81:51] what we were saying earlier about trust
[81:52] you know the government can't even tell
[81:54] you what to eat so how could they
[81:56] possibly tell you what investments are
[81:57] safe how could they tell you what
[81:58] software is safe how could they tell you
[82:01] you know where you should live or how
[82:02] you should live or how you should even
[82:03] think and this all goes back to you know
[82:06] for me I I think the top things are are
[82:09] taking control of your diet taking
[82:10] control of your money with Bitcoin
[82:12] taking control of your privacy with you
[82:14] know Linux and calx and and graphine Os
[82:18] and taking control of uh you you your
[82:21] own education but also your children and
[82:23] your family's education through
[82:25] homeschooling programs that um kind of
[82:28] keep that spark of interest and um
[82:31] Independence that that I think is
[82:33] necessary to really create the the great
[82:35] thinkers of
[82:36] tomorrow I love that really cool um
[82:40] coming now closer to the end of the
[82:41] podcast I have one question to ask each
[82:43] and every one of my guests and it is
[82:45] what can we learn from you besides
[82:47] Bitcoin we already heard a lot about
[82:49] outside but is there anything else you
[82:50] want to add here sure um so one fun fact
[82:54] about me is that I'm a wrestling coach
[82:56] so I wrestled in college I was
[82:59] surrounded by uh one of my teammates
[83:01] actually went to the Olympics and nearly
[83:03] took the bronze medal so not quite at
[83:05] his level I would consider myself more
[83:07] in the the Phil Jackson camp where I got
[83:09] close enough to success and I understand
[83:12] you know what it takes and um in a lot
[83:15] of ways it's an analogy for life so I
[83:16] love giving back to the community and
[83:18] just teaching them what I know the
[83:19] techniques that I had to learn the hard
[83:21] way from uh messing them up and uh
[83:23] getting my my ass
[83:25] and um you know just taking those
[83:27] lessons and uh and turning them into
[83:29] into wisdom into a good technique for uh
[83:31] for for younger men and helping them
[83:33] develop into you know the strong men
[83:35] that we want to see out in the world oh
[83:38] I love that it was similar for me for
[83:40] with swimming uh was on National level
[83:42] in Austria which is uh nothing against
[83:44] the American national level but it was
[83:48] good for Austrian standards I just saw
[83:50] like oh like if I really want to go
[83:52] further go to Olympics I need to do so
[83:55] much more and I was like I don't want to
[83:57] be a swimmer like that that's not I'm
[84:00] not as passionate about it uh but I
[84:04] still go swimming I was today also um
[84:07] one hour in the pool I I love swimming
[84:09] and it's really cool really cool perfect
[84:11] and uh then we have our end routine of
[84:15] the podcast where the previous guest is
[84:17] asking a question for next guest without
[84:18] knowing who the next guest actually is
[84:20] and your question from sorry you want to
[84:23] add something no no oh so okay uh uh and
[84:28] your question is what is your favorite
[84:30] way that Bitcoin affects Humanity what
[84:32] is my favorite way I I would just say
[84:34] the way that it realigns you towards
[84:36] truth and you know eliminates a lot of
[84:39] um the noise a lot of the politics from
[84:42] life that um that shouldn't be there uh
[84:45] maybe it hasn't fully fulfilled that
[84:47] promise but I have found that especially
[84:49] here in the the Austin Bitcoin Community
[84:51] a lot of the people that I meet are High
[84:53] Caliber High character people that when
[84:56] you shake their hand it really means
[84:57] something and that's really what I want
[84:59] to help move us towards as a society
[85:01] that's why I'm so passionate about
[85:03] Bitcoin I'm sure I'm not the only one so
[85:05] I think that's that's critical to the
[85:07] future is to um is to De incentivize
[85:11] subterfuge and lies and move us more
[85:14] towards truth so that we can trly be
[85:16] what we are meant to be I love that
