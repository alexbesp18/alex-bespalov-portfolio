[00:00] the model is predicting $1 million in 4
[00:03] years you can measure how much Bitcoin
[00:05] is enough to retire one interesting way
[00:07] to do it is when you divide total
[00:09] Bitcoin by the number of millionaires in
[00:11] the world this get you to
[00:13] 0.36 Bitcoin power tells us that Bitcoin
[00:16] right now is growing at a 46% annual
[00:20] rate whatever liquid investment that I
[00:22] have I put it in Bitcoin and that's my
[00:24] only game and it's actually has made my
[00:27] life very very easy whenever you have a
[00:29] lot of leverage building up in the
[00:31] derivatives pretty soon we will have a
[00:33] crash in Bitcoin until all the Leverage
[00:35] is cleared up and whenever derivatives
[00:38] goes really really short especially with
[00:40] leverage Bitcoin pumps significantly the
[00:43] top of the next bubble should be
[00:46] somewhere around 300K when we look at
[00:48] all the data it seems like waiting now
[00:51] one year to buy Bitcoin is a terrible
[00:53] terrible idea understanding economics is
[00:56] not even an option it's a must for
[00:58] everyone to have a better life and on
[01:01] not understanding economics it's going
[01:02] to have devastating consequences if you
[01:05] are the Socialist under 20 you don't
[01:07] have a hard but if you're still a
[01:09] socialist over 20 you're an
[01:11] [Music]
[01:14] idiot it's uh it's it's Bitcoin power
[01:16] low time I call it like that power what
[01:21] power L season because it's getting more
[01:22] and more popular oh power loss season
[01:25] yeah it's getting really a lot more
[01:27] power uh powerful a lot more
[01:30] popular um you are my fifth guest
[01:34] actually on on on the show um you
[01:38] probably know Fred that was on the show
[01:40] you probably know Stephen H and you
[01:42] probably know jaavan of course uh he was
[01:45] the first one to introduce me and it was
[01:47] like a two and a half hour episode and I
[01:50] was like what is that when Javan
[01:53] introduced it to me I had no idea about
[01:54] it at all and now I slowly slowly begin
[01:57] to grasp it a little bit uh no expert at
[02:00] all and I had Adrian Morris on he was a
[02:04] little bit more critical and he raised
[02:05] some points uh and yeah it was was
[02:08] interesting to hear some some of the
[02:10] other side also um but yeah uh let's
[02:14] let's first start with like uh why why
[02:17] do you want why do you like the power
[02:19] law and and what is it good for for the
[02:21] people that uh don't know about it at
[02:22] all yeah so I am a you know I'm a
[02:28] professional d analyst so uh the reason
[02:32] I like power law is that it's done
[02:34] correctly
[02:36] so um there is a lot of bad models um in
[02:40] the space like for example when Plan B
[02:43] came up with this model I didn't
[02:46] even it didn't even attract me enough to
[02:49] for me to kind of even replicate his
[02:51] work uh even though like I said I do
[02:54] this for a living every day I analyze
[02:56] financial
[02:58] data um but
[03:00] this model is uh done correctly but
[03:04] again doesn't mean that it can give us
[03:08] like superpowers to predict the future H
[03:11] it just means the math is correct and
[03:13] that just gave me the and there's also
[03:16] an very interesting theory behind it um
[03:21] a lot of the times problems happen when
[03:24] people find
[03:26] correlations and they find two lines
[03:28] that happen to work together move
[03:30] together and they think okay now we
[03:33] found something that can predict um the
[03:36] other variable and they rely too much on
[03:40] it and they kind of believe it too much
[03:42] and even try to trade with it and that
[03:45] becomes um a rude awakening pretty soon
[03:51] and uh but because of that just having
[03:57] a A fitting line a well fitting line is
[04:00] not enough so even though again with the
[04:02] par law model the fit is okay uh
[04:05] actually pretty good um it's not enough
[04:08] we need a theory behind what's going on
[04:11] as well so uh par La includes extra
[04:15] things that gives us more Assurance for
[04:18] example it can explain why do we see
[04:21] that very very um uh goodlook CH
[04:25] goodlook growth following a very simple
[04:28] mathematical relationship ship the
[04:30] reason for that is you can trace back
[04:32] the growth of price to growth of uh
[04:35] Bitcoin Network So within the math you
[04:39] can also include the adoption and number
[04:42] of addresses as a proxy for Bitcoin
[04:46] adoption and you see that it kind of
[04:48] begins explaining the bitcoin's price
[04:50] growth using uh based on something like
[04:54] the medf law so uh there is I guess
[04:59] there is a lot of explanations as well
[05:02] for why we see that that model so that
[05:05] gives me uh you know a lot more
[05:07] confidence to to really focus on this
[05:09] model and uh and explore it further
[05:13] because the math is correct and there is
[05:15] we also understand a lot better why we
[05:18] see that shape and that growth so it's
[05:21] um more of understanding how Bitcoin
[05:24] grows and not a trading tool yes um very
[05:29] important to understand what the hell is
[05:31] happening because like I said a lot of
[05:34] times people just say okay these things
[05:35] are moving together so I have an
[05:38] indicator uh the main thing I want to
[05:41] understand is why you know why is
[05:43] variable y variable X connected to
[05:45] variable y uh can I understand the
[05:49] mechanism that links these two and if I
[05:52] understand it I can make the claim that
[05:55] one is causing the other if that's if
[05:57] you pass all these tests then you can
[06:00] say x is predicting y otherwise you're
[06:03] just playing with uh with fire because
[06:06] correlations uh don't always last but
[06:09] causal relationships do um so if you if
[06:13] you do the analysis right and you figure
[06:15] out something that's really causing the
[06:17] other thing that's the only time you can
[06:19] use it for some level of prediction and
[06:22] even then it's all prob probabilistic
[06:24] right it's all probabilities you can
[06:26] never have very high you can never have
[06:28] very very high
[06:30] uh predictions but you can say something
[06:32] like 80% likely that this is going to
[06:34] happen and you have to have a plan for
[06:36] the 20% that this doesn't happen
[06:39] interesting I want to start with
[06:41] something that I just thought about now
[06:43] um I had I remember two or three points
[06:46] that uh Adrien Morris brought up that
[06:48] kind of made sense for me that I just
[06:50] want to uh get in here and we maybe can
[06:53] talk about it he said one thing that
[06:56] he's like if it's a tool that not just
[06:59] tries to the to to see why in the past
[07:02] uh Bitcoin is growing that much but also
[07:04] maybe a future tool where we like okay
[07:06] around like 23 2035 we should be there
[07:09] like a little bit of a prediction tool
[07:12] um his his point was like the the the
[07:15] band with and the range of of that is is
[07:18] very very Broad and I hear that a lot in
[07:20] in discussion where like oh but the
[07:22] power L doesn't really say something
[07:24] because those those band withs those
[07:26] multiples um are too prad it's
[07:30] interesting for me because like
[07:31] obviously like you always have like a a
[07:34] band withd and and and some some
[07:37] tolerance in that uh and as I understand
[07:40] it from you it's not a prediction a
[07:42] trading tool otherwise like then it's
[07:44] it's anyways like not like that but is
[07:47] is why are those bandwidths so so Broad
[07:50] and uh is it also like are like um how
[07:55] should s is there like um predictions of
[07:58] like that the the outer band with you
[08:01] can basically Outsource because we don't
[08:03] really need that like is there like
[08:06] should we only focus on the the inner
[08:07] band with or like how does this how does
[08:09] this work yeah so uh listen power law is
[08:14] fundamentally a regression
[08:17] line um a regression curve or line is it
[08:21] is it looks like a line but it's but
[08:24] there's no actual line in there it's all
[08:27] probabilities so the line you see is
[08:29] only the average that's predicted but
[08:32] there is a whole amount of probabilities
[08:35] around it and if if it's following if
[08:37] it's based on a normal distribution
[08:39] actually the maximum and minimum is
[08:41] endless so so it can go super high or
[08:46] super low but the probability is like
[08:49] ignorable right so typically we think
[08:52] the maximum or minimum is uh three
[08:56] standard deviations on the upside and
[08:58] three standard deviations to the
[09:00] downside after that the probability is
[09:02] very low so we just assume or we just
[09:05] cut it off but um technically anything
[09:08] is possible right now in the parallel uh
[09:12] the ups and downs are about
[09:15] 50% so if it's if it if the model is
[09:19] kind of predicting projecting uh $1
[09:23] million in four years um it's actually
[09:29] more you have to think in probabilities
[09:31] it it's it's some kind of a range
[09:34] between half a million to $2
[09:37] million um uh but you know it's not a
[09:40] small I I understand it's a big range
[09:44] but it's also not huge because you're
[09:46] predicting four years from now I mean
[09:48] it's it's crazy to even have something
[09:50] like this um 50% error on each side is I
[09:56] I guess I can take it for the next five
[09:58] years but also I don't really you know
[10:00] do anything with this uh in terms of
[10:03] like I don't count on the exact number
[10:06] on the exact level that the price would
[10:08] reach and then I open a trade based on
[10:10] it no it's first and foremost a tool to
[10:14] build conviction a tool to understand
[10:16] the pattern right and then there there
[10:19] are also some things that parot doesn't
[10:21] explain it doesn't explain the
[10:23] bubbles it explains the average growth I
[10:26] mean you have to understand the concept
[10:28] of an average average actually may never
[10:30] happen average happens perhaps like once
[10:33] a year but most of the time Bitcoin is
[10:35] either in a bubble or is in is in a you
[10:39] know blood bath below the below the
[10:42] average so um uh bubbles will create a
[10:47] lot of deviation to the upside and
[10:51] then they might burst and the price
[10:53] crashes back down to the average and
[10:56] then quickly passes the average because
[10:58] at that point people everybody is like
[10:59] depressed so they sell a a little bit
[11:02] more than what they should right and and
[11:05] the price goes uh below it but the
[11:08] average is still good to know because it
[11:11] gives you a what I really like to call
[11:13] it a fair value concept right it gives
[11:16] you some place to to to to base your
[11:20] expectations off of but you also have to
[11:24] consider everything is possible right
[11:26] there's a lot of volatility in Bitcoin
[11:29] so um just to answer your question I
[11:32] guess I'd summarize it like this 5 years
[11:34] from now uh $1 million of error in
[11:38] prediction is fine uh it's it's not as
[11:41] small but there's nothing there's no
[11:44] financial data that you can predict five
[11:46] years from now with that uh accuracy so
[11:50] it's that's not the problem actually the
[11:53] problem that you should focus on is
[11:55] whether we we should even try to project
[11:59] the this regression model into the
[12:01] future um because it is created based on
[12:06] historical data what makes you think
[12:09] that you can project it into the future
[12:12] and uh rely on on at least the average
[12:15] numbers that it gives
[12:18] you and I can quickly again go back to
[12:20] my my previous point that uh that's why
[12:25] I if you show me a perfect line on a
[12:28] data set I will never projected into the
[12:30] future right because I don't know if
[12:32] you've done it correctly to capture the
[12:34] main processes in the data okay in the
[12:38] data set there is systematic things that
[12:41] happen like the real stuff there is also
[12:45] noise right so and I don't know if your
[12:48] model is capturing the systematic
[12:50] Behavior or the noise if it's capturing
[12:53] the
[12:54] noise uh you're just explaining some
[12:57] things about the past which will never
[12:59] repeat exactly the same in the
[13:01] future if it's capturing the systematic
[13:04] relationship you are you are uh you have
[13:07] a model that um you know captures the
[13:12] most important the the important forces
[13:14] in a system that will continue to happen
[13:16] in the future as well okay now uh we
[13:21] need a lot of good regression work and
[13:24] also good theory and
[13:27] good and analysis of mechanism behind it
[13:31] to be slightly more confident that we
[13:35] are capturing the systematic part not
[13:37] the noise part okay now uh there's a lot
[13:41] of tests you can do with data analysis
[13:43] to test the model in terms of whether
[13:45] it's capturing noise or not uh one of
[13:48] them is cross validation and if I did
[13:51] that on on both say Plan B model and
[13:54] power law model and and even if you go
[13:57] back in time and use the data up until
[13:59] 2020 or 2019 you see that powerlaw will
[14:04] keep its
[14:05] accuracy uh Plan B fails that test
[14:08] essentially uh the what we do in that
[14:11] test is we just keep some of the data
[14:13] out of the axis of the model so you
[14:16] train the model on some of the data and
[14:18] you test test it on the rest of the data
[14:20] so at least you have some real unused
[14:22] data to check the results against and
[14:25] you could see that plan B models would
[14:27] fail and that tells me that the model
[14:29] actually has a if you look at the plan
[14:31] B's model it has a great fit uh the RS
[14:34] square is like 94 95% it's it seems
[14:37] amazing but if you run the proper tests
[14:40] you will see that it fails to
[14:42] extrapolate into the future so the
[14:44] parallel model passes this
[14:46] test uh to very to simplify it again or
[14:50] actually kind of repeat repeat it in a
[14:52] way that's much easier to capture um if
[14:56] you ran powerlaw in 2016
[15:00] and use the model to predict today um
[15:03] seven uh uh 8 years later today it will
[15:06] give you very similar
[15:08] numbers like with 10 $20,000 difference
[15:12] we would still be here and I had a tweet
[15:14] that kind of shows uh what what would
[15:17] happen under different uh
[15:19] scenarios um what does that tell me that
[15:23] tells me whatever it was capturing in
[15:26] 2016 was strong and reliable enough that
[15:31] kept happening eight years after
[15:34] that so it was capturing something real
[15:37] in bitcoin's growth pattern what is that
[15:41] real thing uh again perhaps we can talk
[15:44] about that u in the second part but I'll
[15:46] just give you a brief
[15:47] overview um you understand what's going
[15:51] on a little bit better if you look at
[15:53] addresses okay when you look at
[15:56] addresses addresses are growing
[15:59] um as a cube of time so it's a
[16:03] multiplier of third power of time and um
[16:09] this is a lot like this is a lot like
[16:12] virus growth right because the pro the
[16:14] thing is if you have one person it's
[16:18] going to take him a long time to
[16:19] convince the second person like said
[16:21] though she was uh converting um
[16:25] halin difficult but if you have 100
[16:29] people maybe the next person is easy to
[16:32] convert maybe you can quickly have five
[16:35] other people join the network if you
[16:37] have a million people um then you see
[16:40] your new people automatically joining
[16:43] right so it gets faster and faster as as
[16:46] a network growth grows and if you follow
[16:49] the growth of addresses you see the same
[16:51] pattern over time and it makes total
[16:53] sense as the network gets bigger it
[16:57] brings in new people faster and faster
[17:00] and you can actually you know use a
[17:03] mathematical relationship that with
[17:05] reasonable level of accuracy shows this
[17:07] pattern and it makes total sense so it
[17:09] passes the math test it passes the logic
[17:12] test because you see in the data that
[17:15] adoption act accelerates in the sense
[17:18] that as the network grows the number of
[17:21] new people that join also grow so and
[17:25] it's very you know you can think about
[17:27] Larry think from Black back Rock like a
[17:30] few years back we had a small community
[17:32] Bitcoin
[17:33] wasn't wasn't wasn't as big as
[17:36] influential as it is and so BlackRock
[17:39] was calling it the index of money La
[17:41] laundering several years later Bitcoin
[17:45] is bigger so many more people are in it
[17:47] it's more reliable and now Larry think
[17:50] is a one of the biggest proponents and
[17:53] supporters of it uh so you see this
[17:56] prior strength brings in in new
[18:00] participants and new participant imp
[18:03] increase the power of the network to
[18:05] bring in yet newer participants that's
[18:08] why we say everyone will get into
[18:10] Bitcoin just at the price they deserve
[18:13] right so um and you see this pattern
[18:18] exactly in the data and then you see
[18:20] okay should I expect the adoption how
[18:23] should I expect adoption to relate to
[18:25] price that one is also a very clear
[18:28] mathema iCal
[18:30] relationship uh price of Bitcoin is very
[18:33] interestingly highly associated with
[18:35] number of addresses and again as I say
[18:37] this there are there are people who will
[18:39] be typing in the comments oh number of
[18:42] addresses doesn't mean adoption there
[18:44] are people who have many addresses and
[18:46] there are many addresses that are only
[18:49] uh and there are like an exchange that
[18:53] might be showing you one address but
[18:56] that represents so many other people
[18:58] right right that's correct but still
[19:01] number of addresses is a rough measure
[19:03] of adoption like if you have many more
[19:05] people you expect to have many more
[19:07] addresses uh considering all those noise
[19:10] um noises that can happen because of the
[19:13] lack of onetoone relationship but
[19:15] overall the number goes up so you can
[19:16] use it as a rough measure um and if you
[19:19] use that as a predictor of price number
[19:23] of addresses also
[19:25] predicted uh and it's it's a it's a it's
[19:29] a multiplier of second p p power of two
[19:34] of the addresses so you take the
[19:36] addresses raise it to the power of two
[19:39] and with a multiplier that will model
[19:41] price very well and that power of two is
[19:45] exactly what Robert metf predicted
[19:49] Communications networks would do like he
[19:52] said that in a communication Network the
[19:55] value of the whole network is a function
[19:58] of square of number of people who are in
[20:00] the network why because if you have a
[20:03] telephone One telephone it's worth zero
[20:06] because there's nobody else to talk to
[20:08] if a second person is in the network now
[20:11] my telephone is significantly more
[20:13] valuable If instead of two there are 10
[20:16] people in the
[20:17] network it's much more valuable now
[20:21] right
[20:23] so um and medcap said it's a the overall
[20:28] value is a function of the square of the
[20:32] number of members and again we said see
[20:35] that in in Bitcoin as well so there is a
[20:39] very interesting explanation for why we
[20:43] see that regression line fitting very
[20:46] well in Bitcoin all of the stuff that I
[20:49] explained in the past few
[20:51] minutes is makes it a lot more
[20:53] interesting than a coincidental line
[20:56] that somebody throws on the chart like
[20:58] technical analysis okay and that gives
[21:01] us a little bit
[21:03] confidence that this pattern will
[21:05] continue into the future like if you
[21:07] think that Bitcoin has been bringing in
[21:10] 50 million people every year into its
[21:13] Network I mean it's very reasonable to
[21:15] assume that that number will only go uh
[21:19] will will continue and only go higher in
[21:21] the future but exactly how much higher
[21:23] probably you can debate it but uh
[21:28] it the pattern has stayed the same for
[21:30] the last decade or so
[21:34] and it's only reasonable reasonable to
[21:37] assume that it will continue at least as
[21:39] your base case it will continue to do
[21:41] the same in the near future I'm I'm not
[21:44] I'm not going to say like 10 years from
[21:45] now it's too much I mean I even if you
[21:48] have the best model that's that's just
[21:50] too much like M Michael sailor was
[21:52] predicting up until 2040 right so that
[21:56] that's like you know
[21:59] that's a lot uh
[22:01] but in the you know fiveyear fouryear
[22:04] that's reliable and network that's this
[22:07] big it's not going to change its
[22:09] Behavior
[22:10] overnight it's interesting because I
[22:12] think
[22:14] uh when we talk about price predictions
[22:16] is always interesting I GA a lot of data
[22:19] of like putting titles thumnails and and
[22:22] putting uh videos out there from
[22:25] different people having different price
[22:26] predictions on different time zones uh
[22:29] this is always the the one thing I get
[22:31] when I make um something with Prize or
[22:34] adoption predictions within like 20
[22:37] years from now I always get those
[22:38] comments like oh like that's too far
[22:41] away from me like I will be that then
[22:44] what do I have in 20 years from now so I
[22:46] think the the the short terms are short
[22:49] term like medium terms four five years
[22:50] is not that short term way more
[22:52] interesting for people at least what I
[22:54] saw uh anyways but it's interesting that
[22:58] the power um was so predictable over the
[23:02] last eight or what what did you say 10
[23:05] years uh around that time because a lot
[23:08] of things have completely changed in in
[23:11] Bitcoin fundamentally like we have now
[23:14] as Salvador as a country we have the
[23:15] ETFs with black rock we have Michael
[23:19] saor with micro strategy and so many
[23:20] other companies that follow him so like
[23:22] 10 years ago Bitcoin looked very
[23:25] different to to what it is now but
[23:27] you're saying even eight years ago if
[23:30] you would do done it in 2016 you would
[23:33] have came to kind of that 60,000 80,000
[23:37] price range what we have now and from
[23:39] that I think what you said four years
[23:41] between 500k and 2 million something
[23:44] like that you you said um that that's
[23:47] really impressive to see that level of
[23:50] accuracy accuracy accuracy uh but yeah
[23:54] it's a it's it's interesting like uh
[23:56] when we move that out and then there's 1
[23:59] million in in in in five years that's a
[24:03] that gives I think a lot of people a lot
[24:05] of conviction also like it's a
[24:07] conviction Builder as you said I like
[24:10] that way of thinking and and comparing
[24:12] it to the Past yeah and that's something
[24:13] I also um should give credit to Fred
[24:17] Krueger he he was the one that always
[24:20] would say you know I I'm using this
[24:22] whole thing as a conviction
[24:24] Builder
[24:25] um you know it's good to think like that
[24:29] but unfortunately most people will think
[24:31] in terms of hey I'm going to just
[24:32] predict next year and then open up an
[24:35] options trade based on it so you you're
[24:37] saying it's better to like okay I have
[24:40] now my portfolio and based on the power
[24:45] L Bitcoin will maybe or like likely go
[24:48] to around 1 million in the next five
[24:50] years and then I can make a more
[24:53] educated guess on how much of my wealth
[24:57] should be in in Bitcoin and what's my
[24:59] risk adverage and stuff like that and
[25:01] you also said that I think in in the in
[25:02] the beginning where I think Stephen it
[25:04] was where you said like how much of my
[25:06] wealth uh should be in Bitcoin and and
[25:09] you had some math around that um uh can
[25:12] can you may maybe you can quickly
[25:15] summarize It Like H how does that work
[25:17] if if if if it's like how much there's a
[25:21] lot of interesting debates in the
[25:22] Bitcoin Community like how many Bitcoin
[25:24] should I get to like what what what is
[25:26] the amount of of Bitcoin I I I really
[25:29] want to have should it be 0.21 should it
[25:32] be one Bitcoin yeah um that's a great
[25:35] question whenever I hear someone saying
[25:38] you know you need one you need two you
[25:40] need three
[25:41] and6 you need
[25:44] 6.15 um some of I mean most of the time
[25:47] it's just random stuff people say so
[25:51] totally ignore that some other times
[25:54] there's some analysis behind it for
[25:56] example uh one inter way to do it is
[25:59] when you divide um a total Bitcoin by
[26:02] the number of billion number of
[26:04] millionaires in the world I forgot the
[26:06] exact number of millionaires but if you
[26:08] divide it you'll see that there's just a
[26:10] few Bitcoin that all these millionaires
[26:12] in the world could have if you can
[26:15] quickly look it look it up uh I don't
[26:17] know if it's six or 10 and then that was
[26:21] a good rule of thumb to say okay this is
[26:23] the millionaire this is the future
[26:25] millionaire
[26:27] level uh inflation
[26:29] adjusted um and that's a that's a good
[26:33] idea now
[26:35] um another thing you can do is you know
[26:38] have Financial personal financial
[26:40] planning like trafi would do what they
[26:43] do in tradice they look at hey you have
[26:46] some money in stocks they have some
[26:48] money in bonds this is how they're going
[26:50] to grow in the next few years and if you
[26:53] want your profit to be enough to to live
[26:57] comfortably this is how much you need to
[27:00] invest and you can do the same thing in
[27:02] Bitcoin now that we have a model that we
[27:04] can use as a base case one of the
[27:06] benefits of it it gives you reliable
[27:09] base case right base case again doesn't
[27:12] mean you bet your life on it right so
[27:15] you just understand that this is the
[27:17] most likely number and there are other
[27:19] numbers that are possible but if you
[27:21] have to begin with something that's it
[27:23] so power law tells us that Bitcoin right
[27:26] now if you look at the shape of the
[27:28] curve right now it's growing at a
[27:31] 46% annual rate okay and that rate is
[27:35] going
[27:36] down um slowly because hey you get in
[27:41] later of course you should you'll you'll
[27:43] experience less of the benefits but um
[27:47] 46% and it's going to go down to you
[27:49] know little by little every year you
[27:51] exactly can measure these percentages of
[27:54] growth so you can have a really good
[27:57] guess
[27:58] of how much your wealth will grow by the
[28:01] time you retire and that's something
[28:03] actually we should do I guess should run
[28:05] the numbers exactly uh and uh compute
[28:09] some of these things to see for
[28:12] different people how much Bitcoin is
[28:15] needed for whatever income they're
[28:17] looking for so if you want to live
[28:19] really comfortably well perhaps better
[28:21] to invest a lot more in Bitcoin right
[28:23] now and do harder and work harder and uh
[28:27] accumulate right and then we can exactly
[28:31] compute what's your total wealth will be
[28:33] if it follows the historical pattern as
[28:36] again as a base case but then you can
[28:37] also play with some bad worst case you
[28:42] know best case scenarios and see okay if
[28:45] only half half of what I thought
[28:47] materializes what's going to happen and
[28:50] even better and even then we're not
[28:52] going to say just half of half randomly
[28:57] we can even put a probability on it like
[28:59] it's 60% likely that uh you will uh you
[29:04] will get more than half of the base case
[29:06] right so that's a good number to know to
[29:08] kind of build your uh life on or build
[29:12] your plans on if you want to be 90% safe
[29:14] you probably bet on a much much lower
[29:17] Bitcoin level right but but you can do
[29:20] all of those I don't want to get into
[29:21] the weeds uh with that you can you can
[29:25] measure how much Bitcoin is enough to
[29:27] retire
[29:28] okay so that's something I really love
[29:30] to do apsk is a is an is a friend
[29:34] Twitter friend of mine who has begun
[29:36] like doing a lot of cool work here but
[29:38] uh there's tons of
[29:40] potential and uh perhaps in the next few
[29:45] weeks or months I'll do some some uh
[29:47] analysis on these things and put out
[29:49] some useful content for people that
[29:51] really cool but I looked it up there are
[29:53] like 58 millionaires apparently at least
[29:55] in the world uh so that would if you
[29:58] divide 21 million by 58 this gets you to
[30:02] 0.36 Bitcoin so that's that's a that's a
[30:05] number three three Bitcoin or0 three
[30:08] point three point three point three yeah
[30:09] so less less than one right so most
[30:12] millionaires in the
[30:15] world uh will not be able to have a full
[30:18] Bitcoin if they all wanted to buy it
[30:21] right so if you have more
[30:23] than3 you have more than the future
[30:26] Millionaire right and million I I mean
[30:31] with the value today right I don't mean
[30:33] one million is going to be nothing in
[30:34] future but think in terms of the
[30:36] importance of it today which is still
[30:38] not a whole lot
[30:40] but but um so if you have one one is
[30:45] great one is like very safe but doesn't
[30:47] mean you know uh doesn't mean you should
[30:51] I mean it's just a logical thing to do
[30:53] to to save as much as possible and store
[30:56] your value in Bitcoin as much as
[30:58] possible worst case it's going to
[31:02] grow
[31:04] handsomely better than stocks best case
[31:07] it's G to grow much faster than stocks
[31:11] so there's nothing I mean it's very hard
[31:13] to make a case for any other
[31:16] investment yeah that's the interesting
[31:18] thing um like I have such a high
[31:22] conviction Bitcoin that I don't really
[31:24] need a power law conviction Builder even
[31:27] though it's really fun to talk about
[31:30] future price predictions but I'm anyways
[31:32] all in like anyways I don't have any
[31:34] other Investments at all so um it's it's
[31:38] fun to think about that and it motivates
[31:40] me maybe to to work really hard right
[31:43] now and not to to be lazy uh but in
[31:46] general like like so let me tell you
[31:49] something yeah I was 100% invested 100%
[31:53] I mean 100% of liquid because you know
[31:55] you have house and things like that um
[31:58] 100% in Bitcoin before power law I'm
[32:01] still 100% in Bitcoin after power law
[32:04] but sometimes things happen like you get
[32:07] wages you get wage right I'm I'm a wage
[32:09] slave so um you get more or less cash
[32:14] available here and there but typically
[32:16] for the many many years uh not this year
[32:20] but the years before I've always
[32:22] operated at the like minimum bank
[32:24] account cash because I just hate to see
[32:27] any money that's in there I feel like
[32:30] it's being stolen through inflation
[32:33] right so um I I was just funneling
[32:37] everything into Bitcoin and that's how I
[32:40] think about mod I mean I do the a lot of
[32:42] this modeling but also for my personal
[32:45] planning uh I don't kind of say that
[32:49] hey you know let's let's just trade
[32:52] around it you know it's very difficult
[32:55] to because I understand there's a also a
[32:58] chance that your model is wrong you know
[33:00] and if you have the best model in the
[33:02] world you should still think you know
[33:05] there's a good chance that you know
[33:07] things just or maybe your model is right
[33:09] you know some unknown event happens so
[33:13] you have to be always planning for your
[33:15] plan not going according to the plan
[33:19] right so that's important um but
[33:21] nevertheless when you when you analyze
[33:23] your when you analyze the uh
[33:26] fundamentals of Bitcoin vers as many
[33:28] other assets as much as you can whatever
[33:31] liquid um liquid investment that I have
[33:35] I I put it in Bitcoin and and that's my
[33:38] only game and it's actually has made my
[33:41] life very very easy because
[33:45] um I don't have to kind of be a hitch
[33:48] fund comparing the future stock
[33:51] performance of uber against Lyft uh and
[33:55] Google against uh
[33:59] Amazon I'm a business professor so I
[34:01] like to do this but even then I don't
[34:04] have much time to analyze all these
[34:06] things and they change over time and you
[34:08] know how much time is wasted of average
[34:11] people trying to guess
[34:13] Financial results of various companies
[34:17] and so you you spend a lot of time doing
[34:20] it and most of the time you're also not
[34:22] successful outperforming the market so
[34:26] this is a massive cost and no one talks
[34:29] about
[34:29] it no one talks about like the the cost
[34:32] of forcing people to have to invest like
[34:36] a hedge fund like a asset
[34:39] allocator but Bitcoin allows me to just
[34:42] forget about all of it and just look at
[34:45] it as as you know as as if you're
[34:47] watching a burning House people are
[34:49] running around and we on the other side
[34:52] of the street comfortably knowing that
[34:56] uh we have a simple
[34:59] simple solution that will kill them all
[35:02] and outperform them all yeah it's it's
[35:04] it's really fascinating you you um
[35:07] talked about sailor uh briefly um I
[35:10] remember I think I saw one or two tweets
[35:13] about that that the base case of Michael
[35:16] sailor is actually really close to the
[35:19] base case of of the power law like those
[35:22] models are not uh completely um far off
[35:26] is is that true or I I I just remember
[35:28] one one tweet in in the back of my mind
[35:31] where that I saw that yeah so this is
[35:34] what Michael saor does he looks at the
[35:37] current rate of growth which is
[35:40] 46%
[35:42] and because the power law model also
[35:45] models it properly on the current on the
[35:48] on the existing data it also gives us
[35:51] the same number for today so P so sailor
[35:54] base model starts from the correct
[35:56] number that's good
[35:58] uh but because they have an exponential
[36:00] model it's not a power law model it's
[36:03] exponential exponential moves too fast
[36:06] because it doubles every uh so many
[36:10] years and if you do that doubling you
[36:13] see you quickly you know capture the
[36:16] whole world's
[36:18] wealth and even Beyond it there's no
[36:20] money you know there so exponential just
[36:23] doesn't explain the model very well the
[36:25] the price action very well so he
[36:27] continues from the correct starting
[36:30] point with an exponential exponential
[36:33] grows too fast and saor has he's a smart
[36:37] man he realizes there is a problem here
[36:40] so he he knows that Bitcoin cannot keep
[36:45] growing 46% year after because that's
[36:47] going to compound and capture the whole
[36:49] world immediate uh very soon I mean um
[36:53] and actually some of his bull cases
[36:56] exceed the toal wealth in the world so
[36:59] that's automatically
[37:00] invalidated but to fix that he realizes
[37:04] that the 40% every year should go lower
[37:07] next year lower next year no lower next
[37:09] year and by doing that
[37:12] he adjusts his exponential model to to
[37:17] slowly to to get some kind of slower so
[37:21] that it matches a power LW growth
[37:23] pattern it's not exactly the same but
[37:25] it's very similar actually
[37:28] so for some reason I mean his base case
[37:31] ended up predicting very similar number
[37:33] to the numbers to the power law which
[37:36] you know I take it if you like Michael
[37:37] sailor those are the almost correct
[37:40] numbers so the base is good but the bear
[37:43] and bull are just
[37:46] amazingly uh different and they are too
[37:49] low and too high essentially
[37:52] covering uh every single thing that can
[37:55] happen um so
[37:58] you know it those could never be wrong
[38:01] because price will always be somewhere
[38:03] between the his be case and bull case if
[38:07] you watch my podcast already for more
[38:09] than two times you know how extremely
[38:11] passionate I am about self custody and
[38:14] the first very very very important step
[38:17] to self- custody is always getting
[38:20] yourself a hardware wallet and I have
[38:23] one for you here this is the Bitcoin
[38:26] only Edition from the bitbox my favorite
[38:29] single signature Hardware wallet on the
[38:31] market another really important piece of
[38:35] self custody if you have a hardware
[38:37] wallet is the backup of the seat phrase
[38:39] and bitbox made the perfect solution to
[38:42] back up your seat phas they made a
[38:45] reusable steel wallet check out that
[38:48] beauty it's durable and extremely heavy
[38:51] if I put it on the desk I seriously feel
[38:54] for my own table it's so so heavy end
[38:57] durable I love it this is where my seed
[39:00] phrase is secure go to bitbox do ss/
[39:05] robin to get your bitbox and if you use
[39:08] code Robin you even get 5% off of your
[39:13] complete order and the next step is to
[39:15] really level up your sovereignty as an
[39:18] individual you have to have the most
[39:20] secure self custody setup you have to
[39:23] secure your own devices you have to
[39:26] protect your PR pracy you have to set up
[39:29] an inheritance plan and depending on
[39:31] where you live you even want to have a
[39:33] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[39:36] in case something goes really really
[39:38] wrong and through all those steps the
[39:40] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[39:43] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[39:46] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[39:49] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[39:52] how you can level up your sovereignty
[39:55] and last but not least I have something
[39:57] completely new for you guys I partnered
[40:00] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[40:04] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[40:07] saw created by anyone look at that
[40:10] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[40:12] made an perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[40:16] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[40:19] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[40:21] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[40:25] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[40:27] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[40:31] watch collections you have the date of
[40:34] the first ever Mind Bitcoin Block in
[40:37] there and of course also the block
[40:39] height and which Epoch we are currently
[40:42] in I love the level of detail they put
[40:45] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[40:48] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[40:50] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[40:53] love those watches so so much yeah you
[40:56] talked about about uh 50% that the the
[41:00] power loss says between like the 1
[41:02] million and uh the 500,000 and the 1
[41:04] million to two million uh MK uh what
[41:08] would that be in what was the date from
[41:11] Mich I think
[41:12] 2045 I think he he yeah that half that
[41:16] range will be 15x in Michael
[41:20] sailor's model so the difference between
[41:23] his Bull and Bear is 15x but think about
[41:26] it like in 2045 15x is like 15 times the
[41:32] real Global real estate
[41:35] market so that's that that's like uh
[41:40] like even more than like I said much
[41:42] more than the global wealth is in the
[41:44] error term I mean that's just too much
[41:46] uh too much to be useful even you know
[41:49] there we don't expect the models to be
[41:51] extremely accurate right we just want
[41:52] them to give us directional guide but
[41:56] this is like
[41:58] like um I guess I don't know how to
[42:00] think about it like it's just you can
[42:03] think of it as the maximum and minimum
[42:06] not not anything more it's just the all
[42:08] the things that can happen is covered in
[42:12] here yeah it's a little bit like your uh
[42:15] you would say like oh yeah tomorrow it
[42:17] it can be uh 12 degrees but it could
[42:19] also be 40 yeah so say think about this
[42:23] way like if I'm predicting the size of
[42:25] the global real estate market Market in
[42:27] 2045 I'm fine if I'm wrong by a factor
[42:31] of
[42:32] two but if it's wrong by a factor of 10
[42:35] or 15 it's probably not helpful for
[42:40] decision making because that's gonna
[42:43] change change you know some of my
[42:45] strategies significantly let's talk
[42:47] about something that you brought up
[42:48] before uh you saw I wrote it down the
[42:51] Bitcoin cycle with the volatility
[42:54] adjustment that power law that that
[42:57] seems to be very interesting also with
[42:59] with the cycle impacts on on bitcoin
[43:02] before we get into that do you think
[43:04] that those cycles that we have now are
[43:07] always continuing because like the
[43:10] impact of it with lower and lower
[43:12] inflation that Bitcoin has uh with the
[43:16] with the block re rewards diminishing um
[43:19] that the cycle the fouryear cycle should
[43:21] not have as a big of an impact as it had
[43:23] like the past few uh Cycles how do you
[43:27] think in general of the impact of the
[43:29] Haring and those fouryear Cycles in
[43:32] Bitcoin and then we can get into uh the
[43:35] the charts that you have yeah so U
[43:38] that's a great question as well
[43:40] Cycles um let's let's think about what
[43:43] happens to a cycle right what happen
[43:46] when we see a cycle or a bubble uh this
[43:49] these things are studied in other
[43:51] financial markets um quite a bit not not
[43:53] a whole lot but in a significant way um
[43:56] because the math is very complex it's
[43:59] kind of a Madness moment where a crowd
[44:02] is rushing to to an asset and um
[44:07] difficult to kind of model this but so
[44:08] that's why you you you find not a whole
[44:10] lot of academic work but there's quite a
[44:12] bit what they find is something like
[44:15] this imagine Bitcoin is uh let's say we
[44:20] have an imaginary Bitcoin with no
[44:22] volatility right and then from day one
[44:25] it's set in stone it's going to grow
[44:27] every year by the same or similar amount
[44:30] uh with the same pattern totally
[44:32] predictable if that happens if if today
[44:36] someone gives the world an asset like
[44:39] that everyone knows next year it's going
[44:42] to grow by x amount so what's the
[44:44] logical what's the logical investment
[44:46] decision for the world now you answer
[44:49] that wa what you uh come again sorry so
[44:53] imagine we have an asset that it is
[44:56] guarant guaranteed that next year is
[44:58] going to grow by 50% oh yeah yeah of
[45:01] course like everyone would flag in and
[45:04] it's kind of it's going of built in
[45:08] so uh 8 billion people in the world they
[45:12] won't have they will have zero
[45:13] uncertainty about its future performance
[45:15] so they will all jump
[45:18] in so it will immediately do whatever it
[45:21] was supposed to do next year and the
[45:23] next 10 years in a very short amount of
[45:26] time
[45:28] so this is why a
[45:30] predictable asset cannot exist in
[45:34] financial markets because if it's
[45:37] predictable people will just buy it and
[45:41] then it's not predictable anymore right
[45:44] so so this is why you must have
[45:47] volatility in Bitcoin and this is why
[45:49] Michael saor is right when he says
[45:50] volatility is
[45:52] Vitality if anything is supposed to grow
[45:55] it will definitely be volatile because
[45:58] you just can't control people as soon as
[46:01] they get more clarity on on growth they
[46:04] will rush into it and this causes a ton
[46:07] of growth that should not be happening
[46:10] now but unfortunately it does and then
[46:13] inevitable crash but we will crash to a
[46:17] higher level than before okay
[46:21] now um what happens like the psychology
[46:24] of a bubble like is like this again go
[46:26] back to our boring asset every year is
[46:29] going to grow the same amount uh a few
[46:31] people jump in they they have probably
[46:35] better information than others they or
[46:36] better foresight they realize that this
[46:38] is a good investment they come in bring
[46:40] in their money and the asset grows
[46:43] growth makes more people believe in kind
[46:46] of realize it and take notice and they
[46:49] will join as well and this accelerates
[46:52] the prior growth so now it it you know
[46:56] rather than growing like a line or
[46:58] something predictable it now begins
[47:00] growing very fast the faster it gets the
[47:04] more uninformed participants will
[47:06] realize it and there's many uninformed
[47:11] many more uninformed people than
[47:12] informed people if you haven't
[47:14] noticed so so um that causes like the
[47:19] higher the price goes the bigger the
[47:22] mass of people it attracts and then the
[47:25] bigger the jump in the number in the
[47:28] price and it at that point it's it is an
[47:30] exponential growth and it quickly
[47:34] exhausts the potential Market capacity
[47:39] so it will attract anyone that would be
[47:42] attracted like 2017 when the price went
[47:45] from I don't know 2,000 whatever 1,000
[47:48] to 20K at 20K like the market was
[47:51] exhausted every human being that would
[47:54] have been interested in Bitcoin is
[47:56] already aware of it otherwise like
[47:59] people other people who would who were
[48:01] living under the rock
[48:02] aside uh that's the maximum awareness
[48:06] everywhere talk people talk about it
[48:08] same thing in
[48:10] 2021 you know all the news networks all
[48:13] the pots all you know Clubhouse here
[48:16] everywhere people were talking talking
[48:18] about it just because the price had gone
[48:20] up okay that's exactly the point where
[48:23] money runs out so there's no more money
[48:26] everyone that was aware is already in
[48:29] and then the bubble reaches the max when
[48:31] it reaches there again a few early smart
[48:34] people perhaps hedge funds perhaps you
[48:37] know people with Advanced tools they
[48:40] realize or sometimes it just random
[48:43] guess they
[48:44] realize this thing is ending like in the
[48:48] last cycle if you follow gray scale
[48:50] growth you will exactly see that the in
[48:54] inflow of additional money into Gray
[48:56] scale ETF not ETF the the what was it
[49:00] called the trust I think
[49:03] uh stopped right at the top so the flow
[49:07] of new
[49:09] money which was arbitraging some trafi
[49:13] uh
[49:14] trick um stopped at gray
[49:17] scale and so new money stopped and then
[49:21] little by little more sophisticated
[49:23] Financial players realize that hey the
[49:25] game is almost over uh and they will
[49:27] sell when they sell the price at that
[49:30] top drops by one level not concerning
[49:34] nothing nothing worrisome
[49:36] but that little drop still causes some
[49:40] other people's stops to be triggered
[49:42] some more people to get concerned and
[49:45] that causes more s sales that causes
[49:48] more sales and a lot of leveraged
[49:50] players that came in because they were
[49:52] uninformed and they just heard about it
[49:54] last couple of weeks and they wanted to
[49:57] you know quickly earn a lot of
[49:59] profit they they get
[50:01] liquidated and then uh the crash
[50:05] accelerates so a slow crash a slow
[50:08] correction turns into a significant
[50:10] crash the the remember the guy who was
[50:12] saying Bitcoin is going to do whoosh go
[50:14] down and this is the this is the
[50:17] mechanics of a bubble okay now in the
[50:21] last sorry for the long answer but this
[50:23] was an important foundation now in the
[50:26] last few Cycles like since the beginning
[50:29] this Dynamic was created was kickstarted
[50:32] by the having so when having happened
[50:35] first of all a fundamental shock
[50:37] happened Supply went down and that gave
[50:39] us the early growth which will bring in
[50:42] so many other people to to Kickstart a
[50:44] significant growth would
[50:47] happen um and then there's also the
[50:50] psychological effect after people saw it
[50:52] one or two times and every time they
[50:54] expect it to happen right now the fun
[50:56] mental effect is gone like the supply
[50:59] impact of another having is negligible
[51:03] compared to all the other things like
[51:05] ETFs are buying a goddamn you know
[51:09] quarter of a billion a day right that's
[51:12] a lot more
[51:13] than another having will do so it's just
[51:17] not important at all compared to
[51:19] anything else even if it accumulates for
[51:21] months and months not going to be a
[51:23] significant impact a single billion are
[51:26] joining Network would have a similar
[51:28] impact
[51:29] now uh the other thing is psychological
[51:32] psychology is still strong people are
[51:34] going to follow this old patterns so I'm
[51:37] expecting the effect of Cycles to kind
[51:39] of weaken a little bit to the extent
[51:43] that that psychology exists but
[51:45] psychology can change like if people
[51:47] only see once that the past cycle
[51:50] pattern has changed then that's where it
[51:52] stops right tended the psychological
[51:54] effect also goes away but might case is
[51:57] that we're going to still see a lot of
[51:59] Cycles but not following the four-year
[52:02] pattern we just had a little meaning
[52:05] cycle because of ETFs right and that was
[52:08] not matching what you would expect from
[52:10] the four-year cycle like you don't you
[52:13] don't expect an all-time high before the
[52:16] having I don't think at least that's uh
[52:19] anywhere in the historical pattern right
[52:21] so I'm expecting a lot of those things
[52:23] but because of other reasons not to
[52:25] having perhaps perhaps some nation state
[52:28] adoption or some other geopolitical
[52:30] event that will Kickstart a new a new
[52:34] Madness phas it's interesting one
[52:36] thought I had when you were speaking in
[52:38] my head was C could we enrich the the
[52:42] power law with more data to make it more
[52:44] accurate with I don't know with Google
[52:46] how many Google searches were made on on
[52:49] bitcoin or or what's a sentiment on on
[52:52] Twitter or something like that like is
[52:54] is is that a possibility to to find
[52:57] interesting data points uh in the
[52:59] history enrich the power
[53:02] further yeah for sure um you can add
[53:06] more components to have better Clarity
[53:09] on the fouryear Cycles too but just as I
[53:14] explained if you
[53:17] model um if you just assume like naively
[53:20] that every four year we're going to have
[53:21] this bubble with X percentage which is
[53:24] like what you see in most Twitter uh
[53:26] post about prediction they just you know
[53:28] average the last cycle
[53:31] isn't uh well what if the cycle timing
[53:33] changes right that can easily change so
[53:36] that's not a reliable idea and that goes
[53:38] back to my early discussion about the
[53:40] cause the cause is not another fouryear
[53:44] passing and the cause is changing the
[53:47] cause previously was perhaps a a big
[53:50] psychological and fundamental shock and
[53:52] if you understand that you know that you
[53:54] know the fundamental part is going away
[53:57] has gone away
[53:58] so that's not causally explaining the
[54:01] future anymore so that's that's not a
[54:04] reliable way to model now you can find
[54:07] other variables that have a good
[54:09] explanatory power for example if you
[54:13] have uh what I what I am trying to do
[54:15] right now is use derivatives data to
[54:18] predict these bubbles because again the
[54:22] way I think about a bubble is is an
[54:24] accelerating mad of the
[54:27] crowd because there is early investors
[54:30] that are enter by analysis and
[54:33] fundamental view those are
[54:35] long-term uh people or perhaps very
[54:39] sophisticated investors then we have
[54:42] every other group that comes in just
[54:45] because of the price and they're kind of
[54:46] like an emotional play you can find
[54:49] these people very well in the
[54:51] derivatives Market um holding 10x
[54:55] Leverage
[54:57] levels and they are highly levered
[54:59] people highly emotional less
[55:02] experienced and uh very
[55:05] reactive right so you
[55:08] can understand these
[55:10] people's behavior in those markets and
[55:13] if you look at the data you'll see that
[55:15] whenever you have a lot of Leverage
[55:17] building up in the
[55:19] derivatives pretty soon we will have a
[55:21] crash in Bitcoin until all the Leverage
[55:23] is cleared up and whenever there
[55:26] derivatives goes really really
[55:28] short especially with
[55:31] leverage uh Bitcoin pumps significantly
[55:34] so these people are like the perfect
[55:36] counter signal and this one is causal
[55:39] because you have a great Theory why
[55:41] these bad investors should be a counter
[55:44] signal because you know everyone
[55:45] understands when you have too much
[55:46] leverage built up in a system it's gonna
[55:49] it's bad right so if Bitcoin is growing
[55:52] up and then you see no additional
[55:55] leverages built in derivatives that
[55:57] tells me it's a very very reliable
[56:00] growth if it goes up and you see a
[56:02] massive spike in the long lever long
[56:05] positions in derivatives you know that
[56:08] this is created by hot money which will
[56:12] quickly leave at this first sign of
[56:14] trouble right the other side of it is
[56:19] true I think was it last year that we
[56:21] were at
[56:22] 16k um uh in the bottom of the last bear
[56:26] market right I was very worried about
[56:30] the market like everyone else
[56:32] particularly because I I just had
[56:34] somewhere in my mind that you know below
[56:36] 20K was very difficult it has never
[56:39] happened and everybody says it's never
[56:41] happened so I was expecting a lot of
[56:43] like long positions to be there and
[56:44] support the price but we crashed so hard
[56:49] that even that level was crossed and we
[56:51] went to 16k okay then I looked at the
[56:55] derivatives and and with the logic that
[56:58] I explained I saw massive levels of
[57:01] short positions and I knew that you
[57:05] know um these people are the best
[57:08] counter signal so I knew that this is
[57:10] probably the end of it or near the end
[57:12] you know perhaps it will go a little bit
[57:13] lower a little bit higher here and there
[57:16] but this is the this is it I mean
[57:18] there's just so much uh short position
[57:21] that can build up in the market and when
[57:24] you see significant
[57:26] levered short positions that's the place
[57:29] that you know anything else that's left
[57:32] has to be has to be moved into Bitcoin
[57:35] and um and and that give me a lot of
[57:38] confidence you know it gives you a
[57:39] compass like I said right it gives you
[57:42] some bit understanding is always helpful
[57:45] it tells you that like if the price is
[57:47] low it's okay it's just a
[57:50] temporary Panic um reaction particularly
[57:54] driven by lever short sellers right if
[57:57] you know this you don't care you simply
[58:00] wait for these people to get
[58:02] liquidated um now so if you bring in the
[58:06] derivatives data you can improve the
[58:09] average that the Power log gives and
[58:11] have a better sense of when these
[58:13] bubbles or when these crashes might
[58:16] happen that's a great Insight I think
[58:19] that's uh really cool and now uh to the
[58:21] thing that I mentioned before that we
[58:23] should also get to is the wallity
[58:26] volatility adjusted power LW it's an
[58:28] interesting thing I never heard about it
[58:31] uh and when I look at the chart I I can
[58:34] make uh only a little bit out of it so
[58:36] maybe we can uh I will quickly put it up
[58:39] there and then you can then we can see
[58:41] what what that is do you see it yes it
[58:45] looks good yeah even better yeah like
[58:48] you can even get it a little bit bigger
[58:50] even that perfect then um what is the
[58:53] volatility adjusted par index what what
[58:56] what does this say okay so when you run
[58:59] a regression on a data set uh as I said
[59:03] average actually most of the time
[59:04] doesn't happen most of the time data is
[59:07] below or above your average so those
[59:11] deviations That's What I Call deviation
[59:13] the difference of your value from the
[59:15] regression line uh can be sometimes
[59:18] positive can be sometimes negative and
[59:20] if your regression line is great you're
[59:23] going to have a more or less equal
[59:24] number of positives and Nega netives
[59:26] because the line goes through the data
[59:28] okay so um that model gives you the
[59:33] average and if you only focus on the
[59:37] deviations you get the um you get the
[59:41] error error term or again what's not
[59:44] modeled by your line okay now with
[59:49] something like a power law if we have a
[59:51] model for the
[59:53] average what we see based on the
[59:55] previous pattern is price can only
[59:57] deviate from the average so much so if
[60:00] you're too higher than the power law
[60:03] predicted fair value I'm going to use
[60:06] the term Fair very Loosely here but it's
[60:08] an easy term so if the price is much
[60:11] higher than the fair
[60:13] value you expect the price to to go back
[60:17] down to the fair value you don't
[60:19] necessarily know exactly when but you
[60:21] know that's the fair value of the asset
[60:23] so um then if the price goes
[60:27] below the fair value same thing you see
[60:31] a negative
[60:33] deviation and you expect the prices to
[60:36] the price to catch up now in this chart
[60:40] what I'm doing is only taking the
[60:41] deviations deviations is very important
[60:44] because if deviation is too low or too
[60:47] high that's a great sign of reversal
[60:50] right it's kind of like a a a spring you
[60:53] know if if you stretch it too long it's
[60:57] very likely that it's going to rapidly
[60:59] come
[60:59] back so what you see on this chart um
[61:03] shows the deviations and what what I've
[61:06] uh what I find is it's not that simple
[61:10] to just get the raw
[61:12] deviation because bitcoin's Behavior
[61:15] changes over time like in the past in
[61:17] the first and second cycle deviations
[61:19] were significantly larger than the
[61:22] existing
[61:24] deviations uh in terms of percent
[61:26] percentage and that messes up any
[61:29] analysis because you never know how
[61:30] large is too large right so I did this
[61:32] thing called volatility
[61:35] adjusting and I looked at the change in
[61:38] nature of Bitcoin from cycle to cycle
[61:42] and I found a model that gives me uh uh
[61:46] a way to to capture the changing
[61:50] volatility and you see that Bitcoin is
[61:52] very volatile in the first cycle a lot
[61:54] less volatile second cycle and so on and
[61:57] if you adjust those deviations by the
[62:00] volatility instead of it it a
[62:04] compressing chart you see a chart that
[62:07] always
[62:09] Peaks uh and always
[62:11] bottoms near the right place near the
[62:15] cycle Peak and cycle bottom so um on
[62:20] this
[62:21] chart wherever those dots are really red
[62:25] those are the tops of the the cycle
[62:29] wherever they are very dark blue these
[62:32] are near the bottoms or the light blue
[62:35] near the bottoms of the cycle now this
[62:38] tells me that whenever this index which
[62:41] I call volatility adjust the power index
[62:43] vpl whenever it is below 20 you know
[62:48] it's the end of it so that's the maximum
[62:51] negative NE that's the maximum deviation
[62:54] below the power law we can get based on
[62:57] history and whenever it is closer to
[63:00] 100% Perhaps like above
[63:02] 80% tells me that this is now too much
[63:05] deviation to the upside and at least in
[63:08] the past every time this has happened
[63:11] more than 80 and less than 20 we've have
[63:15] had a significant
[63:16] reversal does that make
[63:18] sense where we are where we are right
[63:22] now you can see that a few months back
[63:24] when the when were closer to all-time
[63:27] high early after maybe approval of the
[63:32] ETFs in January and February yes we we
[63:35] reached the point the
[63:38] 50 line 50 is the fair value that comes
[63:43] from the power law anything below 50
[63:45] means undervalue and anything above 50
[63:48] means above uh overvalued now we were
[63:52] kind of fair value and slightly above at
[63:54] once ETFs approved thef spring brought
[63:58] in money but it more or less stopped
[64:01] it's been a choppy action a few months
[64:04] and now the power law fair value is
[64:07] growing because as time grows Bitcoin
[64:09] becomes more and more reliable even if
[64:12] the price doesn't immediately show it so
[64:15] the power law price grows but the
[64:17] current actual price has kind of gone
[64:19] down right and what I have in the bottom
[64:23] of that chart on left and right we have
[64:24] the power LW predict price of 75 right
[64:27] now so so the fair value is 75 but the
[64:33] market right now is 57 so it's below the
[64:36] fair value how much below this vli index
[64:41] puts it on a nice 0 to 100 scale to tell
[64:45] us how big is the deviation now the
[64:48] number I get is
[64:51] 37 okay that's kind of
[64:53] halfway from uh fair value to the
[64:57] absolute bare Market bottom right so
[65:00] this is I think a this is this is a
[65:03] really good number because we may not
[65:04] necessarily hit go back to the bottom
[65:07] all the time every time we are dropping
[65:10] right uh in an in a in the worst
[65:14] scenario we will go back down to a vli
[65:17] index of
[65:19] 20
[65:20] but you know we I I don't think we are
[65:23] kind of headed for a bare Market
[65:26] so uh this is one some of the lowest
[65:30] numbers we're going to see in terms of
[65:31] the vpl in other words the market right
[65:33] now is very cool and cool is great the
[65:37] freezing is better but cool is great and
[65:41] once it starts a new move you will
[65:43] quickly see that okay first we're going
[65:45] to catch up to the power law price
[65:47] perhaps at that point it's going to be
[65:48] 78 or something like that or 80 and then
[65:51] we're going to go beyond it anything
[65:54] beyond the power price is tells me tells
[65:57] me that we entering the bubble phase now
[66:00] bubble doesn't mean it's going to burst
[66:01] tomorrow it it only burst if it's now if
[66:04] it grows to an extremely large size but
[66:08] probability wise it makes you more and
[66:10] more worried about a
[66:13] crash right so for now but it's we are
[66:15] in the other side cool everyone's chill
[66:19] and I love to see all that negative
[66:21] sentiment on Twitter people kind of
[66:23] giving up and that tells me that all
[66:24] those unin formed levered long people
[66:28] are leaving and that's the best thing
[66:30] that can happen to the price of bit it's
[66:32] also uh when when we look at the the
[66:35] chart and when we look at the history uh
[66:38] it's it's likely that we have next year
[66:40] we again such a such a bubble move it's
[66:43] also interesting how how high it went to
[66:45] the 100 in in 20 end of 2013 it is where
[66:50] those those those thoughts are here
[66:51] really interesting to see that we always
[66:53] hit those highs in in end of 13 end of
[66:57] 2017 uh end of 2021 so like 2025 could
[67:01] again be uh such an extremely high
[67:06] bubbly year which just means an
[67:09] aggressively high price what what would
[67:11] you say um if if we see an similar
[67:14] pattern than than the last years which
[67:16] obviously is not guaranteed uh but if we
[67:19] get to like a public state of like 80 or
[67:22] even like 85 or what it is here uh what
[67:25] would the the the Bitcoin price would
[67:28] then like what what do you feel like is
[67:30] the is the highest that we we we should
[67:32] get in the this this bitcoin price cycle
[67:34] so from my other analysis the top of the
[67:38] next uh bubble should be somewhere
[67:41] somewhere around 300K like
[67:44] 250 330 that range but that's the top
[67:48] again right top means it's it's where
[67:51] the bubble will explode so we may from
[67:55] like we may Crash from 300 to
[67:58] 150 right uh so that's important to know
[68:02] but if you're just looking at the place
[68:04] that we might touch uh we might go as as
[68:07] high as 250 or 300 interesting really
[68:10] cool um yeah I like I like that uh chat
[68:14] a lot it's it shows a little bit like
[68:17] for someone like me that is just all in
[68:19] maybe doesn't not make sense that much
[68:21] but if you have the decision or the
[68:23] choice like oh do a buy now
[68:26] with a lot of money or do a buy maybe in
[68:28] a few months with a lot of money it can
[68:30] make sense to say like oh like we are
[68:32] now in a cool phase like it makes sense
[68:34] to buy now instead of waiting now a year
[68:38] when we look at all the data it seems
[68:40] like waiting now one year to buy Bitcoin
[68:43] is a terrible terrible idea but when you
[68:46] look at 2021 or like 2017 the top there
[68:50] you could make an argument around that
[68:52] uh uh volatility and the power law uh in
[68:55] index that you're like oh if if you can
[68:58] wait and you already have some Bitcoin
[69:00] uh you can wait with buying a little bit
[69:02] so like that's that's let me tell you
[69:04] let me tell you how you can also even
[69:05] benefit from an analysis like this
[69:08] because you know the more convicted you
[69:10] are the more of your wealth is in
[69:12] Bitcoin right and at that point if
[69:15] Bitcoin crashes from 300 to 150 your
[69:18] wealth is cut by half right I don't
[69:20] think you're going to just ignore this
[69:22] right um because you know we are this
[69:25] for the long run we're not necessarily
[69:27] like doing anything crazy
[69:30] but 100% of your wealth cutting in half
[69:33] is not worthy so if you if you have a
[69:36] tool that will tell you okay we just
[69:38] can't nothing nothing is broken right
[69:41] nothing is broken we were just in a
[69:43] bubble phase and this was always bound
[69:45] to happen so you or you already expect a
[69:48] crash and this doesn't kind of mess with
[69:51] your psychology if that happens even if
[69:54] you're a long-term invest it's
[69:55] interesting yeah it gives even the
[69:58] long-term investor a little bit of more
[70:00] conviction and insights in that really
[70:03] cool uh you have something else uh like
[70:05] let's let's put that up we already over
[70:07] the one hour but I feel like it's it's
[70:09] uh it's worth getting into uh anyways
[70:12] it's always fascinating how how how fast
[70:15] the time
[70:17] flies uh let me quickly uh pull it up
[70:21] here so we can look at
[70:23] it uh let's paste it in here sorry I
[70:27] think I I went into too much detail on
[70:30] previous ones but I thought the audience
[70:33] might like the more detail absolutely I
[70:36] think it's it's it's really great and I
[70:38] don't like discussions that are
[70:39] shortened just because of time
[70:41] constraints so I like getting uh deep
[70:45] into stuff uh especially if it's
[70:47] interesting that's why I also don't put
[70:49] any limitations on the L on the on the
[70:52] on the time as I went with javani I
[70:54] think two and a half hours wow uh but
[70:56] usually I try to hit like one hour
[70:58] market so what do we have here mvrv uh
[71:01] changing Market structure and range
[71:03] compressions there are a lot of words
[71:05] that I don't
[71:07] understand yeah so um this is a metric
[71:11] that mvrv is a metric that comes from
[71:14] onchain analysis and this gives me
[71:16] another way to think about the Deens and
[71:19] the lever long
[71:21] players
[71:23] um mvrv is sure
[71:25] for um market value relative to realized
[71:30] value um you know when you think about
[71:33] the market cap capitalization of Bitcoin
[71:37] um there is one market cap but there is
[71:40] also the real amount of dollars that
[71:43] have been entered to the system and
[71:47] other currencies so that real realized
[71:50] value is different than the current
[71:52] market cap why is that because if you
[71:55] know if today there is a billionaire
[71:58] that wants to
[71:59] buy Bitcoin you someone goes mad and
[72:03] wants to buy Bitcoin for $1 million a
[72:06] coin suddenly the price of Bitcoin goes
[72:08] to 1 million but that only rep represent
[72:12] the last trade that happened right does
[72:15] that mean everyone else is going to be
[72:17] willing to trade at that price of course
[72:19] not right but market cap is is a bad
[72:22] metric because it will just multiply the
[72:25] total it will assume that all coins are
[72:29] worth at the latest price okay so if
[72:33] suddenly we have a little bit of a
[72:34] supply shock on exchanges the price will
[72:36] shoot up and market cap will show a very
[72:39] high number but overtime Market
[72:43] stabilizes because most other
[72:44] participants are not accepting that
[72:46] price so it it goes back
[72:49] down um realize price gives you the
[72:53] exact number of dollars that have
[72:55] entered the system so essentially this
[72:57] is a
[72:59] validated value somebody was you know
[73:02] exact amount of value has entered the
[73:05] system so there's no error in
[73:07] there now if market cap is much higher
[73:11] than realized value market value much
[73:14] higher than realized value that tells me
[73:16] that uh a lot of people see great
[73:19] profits in their
[73:20] accounts right the guy brought in $100
[73:24] and now
[73:26] the price has gone up so much and now
[73:27] they see
[73:29] $200 uh in their in their portfolio so
[73:33] that means they are sitting on a lot of
[73:35] paper
[73:37] profits
[73:39] okay so mvrv going higher means that the
[73:45] market cap is much higher than the
[73:49] realized value so most people are in
[73:52] profit because you know $100 million
[73:55] entered the the system but market cap is
[73:59] like way more than that so there's a ton
[74:01] of paper profit in the system but that
[74:04] paper profit is again to to use the
[74:06] terms Loosely it's all fake
[74:09] because um not all fake but more or less
[74:13] it's paper profit right it's something
[74:16] people see on the screen okay now if you
[74:19] see that your Bitcoin is up by 2% you
[74:23] probably won't sell it if you see that
[74:25] your Bitcoin is up by
[74:27] 300% there will be a lot of people who
[74:31] will be motivated to take profit so that
[74:34] is why mvrv can only go up so much it
[74:38] kind of off behaves like another
[74:41] oscillator when it it goes too much
[74:44] higher than uh than the base it will
[74:48] trigger a lot of sales pressure sell
[74:51] pressure okay so again when the total
[74:54] value Val of an asset is several times
[74:57] bigger than the real dollar that has
[75:00] entered it that tells me a lot of people
[75:02] are sitting on unrealized profits and
[75:06] this is sell pressure now in the
[75:08] beginning it's it doesn't create sell
[75:10] pressure because the market is going up
[75:12] and everybody's happy and love loving
[75:15] it but uh after a threshold there is
[75:20] just so much paper profit in the system
[75:23] that it will entice enough people to
[75:25] sell like as you can see in the first
[75:27] cycle mvrv went from one one is great
[75:32] one means you know it's the price that
[75:35] you see exactly equal the number of the
[75:38] amount of dollars that entered the
[75:39] system so there's no risk it's just you
[75:41] know extremely fairly valued but as the
[75:45] price goes
[75:47] up um on average say it went up all the
[75:51] way to about eight eight means market
[75:56] cap was eight times larger
[76:00] than than real dollars that entered
[76:03] Bitcoin and you can see how that can be
[76:06] a significant
[76:07] problem okay
[76:10] um and then at 8 it exploded and went
[76:13] back down to below to one and then below
[76:16] one below one means what means market
[76:18] cap is below the real dollars that
[76:20] entered the market so that tells me a
[76:22] lot of people are on paper
[76:26] losses but that one is the absolute
[76:29] minimum that you should expect because
[76:32] if market cap is even lower than the
[76:34] real dollar in the system it's almost
[76:36] guaranteed that it will go back up so
[76:39] that's like the best bottom indicator
[76:41] that we we can have and as you can see
[76:44] every time actually it has bottomed uh
[76:47] in 2012 in
[76:50] 2015 in
[76:52] 2019 and 202 23 every time mvrv bottomed
[76:57] it was also the bottom of the cycle and
[76:59] the other way too when I already
[77:02] topped uh it was the top of the cycle
[77:04] now the problem is as I said previously
[77:08] behavior of Bitcoin changes cycle by
[77:10] cycle so the top was initially in the
[77:13] first cycle at eight next cycle it
[77:15] didn't go to eight it exploded at six
[77:18] maximum was at six next cycle it can't
[77:22] even go beyond five
[77:25] okay are you following on the chart yeah
[77:28] so next cycle four next cycle three
[77:31] right this is a problem for me because
[77:33] now I don't know next cycle you know
[77:35] what would be the max there's no way you
[77:37] can tell unless you create some crazy
[77:40] connect the dots at the top which is not
[77:42] reliable now
[77:45] um what I did here was that I try to
[77:49] explain what's going on why is this
[77:51] compression happening the bottoms are
[77:54] going up the tops are going down and the
[77:56] graph is getting compressed and then I
[77:57] thought okay this is actually
[77:59] representing the volatility of Bitcoin
[78:01] because volatility is going down as the
[78:02] asset gets bigger you get less and less
[78:05] crazy moves it's much harder to have the
[78:09] market cap deviate from realized cap as
[78:11] the asset is bigger and more liquid and
[78:14] Global all
[78:15] right so then I thought okay if we can
[78:18] find a measure of volatility and correct
[78:21] this chart by that volatility metric it
[78:24] should help and that's exactly what I
[78:26] did if you go to the next chart I have a
[78:29] volatility measure this is my model of
[78:34] volatility uh the height of this chart
[78:36] is the measure of volatility and you can
[78:38] see that it goes up and down in every
[78:41] cycle because it's a lot more volatile
[78:43] at near the top a lot less volatile at
[78:45] the bare Market's bottom but overall the
[78:48] volatility is going down and if I use
[78:50] that model to correct the previous chart
[78:55] if you go to the next chart you get a
[78:56] volatility
[78:58] adjusted mvrv or we summarize it mvrv
[79:03] and it's striking that once you do that
[79:05] all the tops align and all the bottoms
[79:08] align okay so that gives me whenever
[79:12] this metric goes to 100 that gives me a
[79:15] great indicator that uh market cap is
[79:19] too much bigger than the realized cap so
[79:22] massive risk of uh bubble bursting and
[79:25] then when it goes closer to zero that
[79:27] means market cap is way below the
[79:32] realized cap that it's now unsustainable
[79:36] and and we should come back up so um
[79:40] these actually help a lot because you
[79:42] know it turns into a very good metric
[79:44] that was not actionable to an actionable
[79:47] metric so that's that's the summary of
[79:50] the VM
[79:51] vrb that's all really interesting like
[79:54] fact that we kind of collected in that
[79:57] episode now so many indicators uh that
[80:01] are all are indicators of like where are
[80:05] we right now in the Bitcoin cycle and
[80:08] from that it's kind of like where we are
[80:11] likely to go within the next couple
[80:14] months years whatever um and uh and I
[80:18] like that kind of knowledge because in
[80:21] in financial terms even as you said even
[80:23] if you're 100% Bitcoin you still benefit
[80:27] from
[80:28] knowing directionally where the market
[80:31] is going like not trade on it not like
[80:33] day trade or hourly trade on on anything
[80:35] like that it's it's like it's it's not a
[80:38] good model for that uh but no the
[80:40] directional thing if you have a big
[80:42] purchase in in in one year uh you can um
[80:46] way better calculate things and way
[80:49] better see things where where people
[80:51] where things could go I like that a lot
[80:53] that that kind of of certainty that that
[80:56] gives you that um but just not Bet Your
[80:59] Life on it don't bet anything meaningful
[81:02] in it it just like try to look at it as
[81:04] an a financial indicator that help you
[81:08] to make an informed decision that that's
[81:10] what I get as a summary from
[81:13] that yes yeah exactly I I like I like
[81:17] the way you put it um if a model is done
[81:21] right it works only as long as the pro
[81:25] historical pattern continues right um
[81:30] You don't have like I said a whole we
[81:32] don't have a whole lot of reasons that
[81:34] Bitcoin will suddenly change its
[81:35] Behavior but it's not impossible just
[81:38] understand that you know Bitcoin can
[81:40] change its Behavior a little bit but a
[81:42] massive giant ship is not going to just
[81:45] go suddenly change direction may happen
[81:49] slowly but you have to be ready also to
[81:52] accept that reality
[81:54] was the power updated in the last couple
[81:59] years or will it be what would it like
[82:03] what would need to happen to like say
[82:05] like oh we we should adjust it or like
[82:07] we should we have to update it in in
[82:09] some sense uh like I said one of the
[82:12] first tests I ran on on this before I
[82:14] even get in kind of interested I I
[82:18] looked at the power LW that you would
[82:19] have gotten in
[82:21] 2016 and it still works uh
[82:25] pretty well like very very well like if
[82:28] you extrapolate eight years into the
[82:30] future and you're only Wrong by like
[82:33] $10,000
[82:34] $20,000 that I I'll take it so um so
[82:39] there's no reason to change at this
[82:40] point and unlike some people say the
[82:44] parameters should not change like
[82:46] parameters are the same the model that
[82:47] you create today should continue to work
[82:51] in future but as I said if the ship is
[82:54] changing
[82:56] Direction um perhaps in a few years we
[82:59] will see that maybe there was a
[83:01] little you know Improvement that you
[83:04] could do to make it even more accurate
[83:07] but um at that point you still have to
[83:10] run all these tests again and make sure
[83:13] that you kind of optimize the model with
[83:15] the new data new data should always
[83:17] change your model a little bit not a
[83:19] whole lot if um there's another you know
[83:23] scam you can run on is to come up with
[83:25] an overfitting model and every year it's
[83:28] going to predict
[83:31] incorrectly and then you change the
[83:33] parameters and now it's correct
[83:34] predicting correctly again every year
[83:36] you do that and that gives you you know
[83:40] a perpetually correct model right so
[83:42] that's not the way you do
[83:46] it really cool uh as we are progressing
[83:50] the time a lot uh and I want to also be
[83:52] respectful to your time we come now to
[83:55] the endro te I think uh most definitely
[83:58] I want to do a second round in like half
[84:00] a year or year with you I think that's
[84:02] there a lot of uh interesting Avenues we
[84:04] can uh build on that episode to to go
[84:07] further into something and I'm really
[84:09] looking forward to because I just
[84:11] started my podcast like nine months ago
[84:13] I'm really looking forward to those
[84:14] second and third rounds with guests
[84:16] because then we can actually build on an
[84:18] episode uh and can go further into stuff
[84:22] um the the question that I always ask
[84:24] ask uh before the actual end routine uh
[84:27] is always the same question for every
[84:28] guest what can we learn from you besides
[84:31] Bitcoin besides the power besides all
[84:33] the things that we already talked about
[84:35] on the podcast
[84:36] economics um because I I'm I'm a
[84:39] business professor and um I teach a lot
[84:42] of business Concepts plus a lot of
[84:45] Economics so um even though a lot of my
[84:48] audience still likes direct Bitcoin
[84:51] Concepts but I think h standing
[84:54] economics is not even an option it's a
[84:57] must for everyone at least at the basics
[85:01] to uh have a better life and and on not
[85:04] understanding economics is going to have
[85:06] devastating consequences like many
[85:09] nations that switched to Poverty from
[85:12] wealth because they they changed their
[85:16] system into a uh say for example
[85:19] Venezuela right they were one of the
[85:21] richest countries a few decades back
[85:23] they thought hey let's try this thing
[85:25] socialism how bad could it be and most
[85:28] people and politicians in that country
[85:30] didn't
[85:31] really understand economics in terms of
[85:34] you know what is the engine of wealth
[85:37] creation and that the result is now the
[85:39] whole country is in you know
[85:41] hyperinflation significant poverty
[85:44] something like 70 to 80% of the people
[85:46] are now living in extreme poverty uh how
[85:49] can you make such a mistake not
[85:51] understanding economics do you see also
[85:54] uh um the the Western World or like
[85:56] America I don't know where you're from
[85:59] but the Western World Europe uh going
[86:01] down this path slowly unfortunately yes
[86:05] because
[86:07] um lack of under again lack of
[86:09] understanding of Economics plus the
[86:12] appeal of socialism socialism is you
[86:15] know following a noble goal like
[86:18] equality I don't even think it's it's
[86:20] needed like but it's it's kind of for
[86:22] some reason it's appealing like you like
[86:25] I even if I like see someone that has a
[86:28] lot less wealth than I have I feel a
[86:31] little bit unhappy about this
[86:33] right so I don't know there's something
[86:36] in our nature that wants people to be
[86:40] doesn't like that Gap right so that is
[86:44] the
[86:45] engine that uh bad economics is built on
[86:49] right a lot of the people who play on
[86:52] people's emotions they will will make
[86:54] you think that uh if you do this and
[86:58] that the poor will be happier and that
[87:01] brings in a lot of smart people for the
[87:04] ride because you know like I said we're
[87:07] all humans we all have emotions and we
[87:10] all love to see other fellow human
[87:12] beings
[87:13] succeed and and not be poor that's what
[87:17] most people genuinely love to see in
[87:19] other people like no one likes to see
[87:21] other people being poor right um
[87:25] but if you choose the wrong solution the
[87:28] only thing you'll do is to make poor
[87:30] people even worse off and maybe everyone
[87:33] now will be poor so it's important and
[87:36] the goal is good the tool is
[87:40] destructive and that's unfortunately
[87:42] what most people don't understand and
[87:44] especially in wealthier
[87:45] Nations you know the guy has benefited
[87:48] for years from the wealth creation
[87:51] engine that was available in these
[87:53] countries now they're feeling really
[87:55] comfortable and now they're thinking
[87:57] okay what if we kill this wealth
[87:59] creation engine and see if it helps yeah
[88:01] there's a prob saying in in German if
[88:03] you're are
[88:05] socialist if you are on the Socialist
[88:07] under uh 20 you don't have a hard but if
[88:11] you're still a socialist over 20 you're
[88:12] an
[88:15] idiot I love it I love it you guys
[88:19] understand it that's great I'm going to
[88:21] use that a
[88:22] lot I I love that a lot like it's it
[88:25] really captures it because the
[88:27] intentions like the the navity of of of
[88:31] just being a socialist is like yeah you
[88:33] want that everyone is great but then
[88:36] reality kicks it and you're like yeah
[88:38] like a free market capitalistic system
[88:41] yeah this actually works and this
[88:43] actually incentivizes people to work
[88:45] hard and people working hard brings
[88:47] Humanity forward so like all those
[88:49] things that is is easy to understand if
[88:52] you understand economics but but yeah if
[88:55] you're under 20 it's understandable that
[88:58] you have maybe a different view like
[88:59] under 25 whatever the the number is so I
[89:02] think that that captures it really
[89:04] cool perfect then thank you so much we
[89:06] have an endo te where the previous guest
[89:09] is asking a question for the next guest
[89:10] without knowing who the next guest
[89:12] actually is and the question is
[89:14] interesting I could have even asked it
[89:16] before asked the par but the question
[89:19] for you is how can we transition
[89:21] peacefully to a hyper Bitcoin as
[89:24] I think there's I don't see it as a
[89:26] transition necessarily I see it as a
[89:29] long-term
[89:30] process and this is already happening
[89:34] like four years ago like how many things
[89:36] were extremely crazy unlikely and we
[89:40] would brand it as like lunatics for even
[89:43] entertaining those possibilities like a
[89:45] whole nation state adopting the magic
[89:48] internet money Black Rock becoming a
[89:52] Defender and supporter of Bitcoin with
[89:55] billions of dollars presidential
[89:58] candidates fighting over it it's just
[90:01] it's endless like it's orders of
[90:05] magnitude uh more positive news right
[90:07] now that was like extremely crazy so I
[90:10] just don't see any problem but I don't
[90:13] see any like any step change if in a few
[90:16] years we get similar orders of magnitude
[90:19] changes um suddenly a few nations are
[90:22] fighting over capturing more and more of
[90:25] the mining you know oil producing
[90:28] countries exporting their oil to the
[90:30] Bitcoin Network through through massive
[90:33] mining
[90:34] operations um Apple building Bitcoin
[90:38] payments into their device and suddenly
[90:40] Bitcoin becoming a global payment H
[90:43] Global e globally accessible and super
[90:46] easy to use payment
[90:49] mechanism where all the other retailers
[90:51] now easily can accept it that's possible
[90:54] like it's all part of the same path it's
[90:56] not like a significant deviation it's
[91:00] all happening and the engine of this is
[91:03] government irresponsibility like I would
[91:06] say the only reason that Bitcoin may not
[91:09] succeed is if Government suddenly
[91:12] becomes very responsible which uh I
[91:15] think it's a good bet to take the other
[91:17] side
[91:18] off absolutely I like to take that b
[91:22] every every day and even like even if
[91:24] you're on the wrong side of that bet
[91:26] like then we have a responsible
[91:28] government that's
[91:29] good even if the it doesn't happen
[91:32] really cool thank you so much sinan for
