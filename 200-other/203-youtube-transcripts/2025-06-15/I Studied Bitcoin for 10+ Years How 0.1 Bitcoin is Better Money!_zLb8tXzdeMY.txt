[00:00] crypto is a distraction yes if you only
[00:03] chase the technological advancement and
[00:04] you think it's all about technology
[00:06] technology technology you're not asking
[00:08] the question should I build this and now
[00:10] you see 50,000 tokens A Day created on
[00:13] pump. fun and the entire crypto industry
[00:16] is dead if more and more people figure
[00:18] out that there's this parallel system
[00:20] that kind of emphasizes all the flaws in
[00:23] the other system in the Fiat money
[00:25] system and shows how it's Superior
[00:27] verifiable for everyone then slowly but
[00:29] surely more people realize that Bitcoin
[00:32] is a superior store of value Asset first
[00:36] and and a better medium of exchange
[00:37] after but but that that is even further
[00:39] down the road I think it feels like I've
[00:41] seen everything before like everything
[00:43] where we are now the sentiment is very
[00:46] down the fud is very high we have this
[00:48] correction and people think it's over
[00:51] this is all part of it a better money is
[00:53] a way more interesting end point than
[00:56] building the next technological thing
[00:59] that's a that's a
[01:00] [Music]
[01:04] distraction I want to start uh um uh
[01:08] with you because you have one and a half
[01:12] years not a podcast uh I think that
[01:14] that's around that's around it and you
[01:17] went from having the podcast to uh also
[01:19] getting more and more into the podcast
[01:21] now actually also working for Bitcoin
[01:23] company uh if if if I got that right how
[01:25] has been your Bitcoin Journey so far and
[01:28] how has how have you seen Bitcoin
[01:30] developing over the last year since we
[01:33] recorded the last episode yeah really
[01:35] fun to think think about that right that
[01:38] uh time actually goes pretty fast but I
[01:42] also feel that the development of
[01:44] Bitcoin is is going really fast right
[01:47] like um I've been in in Bitcoin a bit
[01:50] longer than you but I've it feels like
[01:53] I've seen everything before like
[01:55] everything where we are now you know the
[01:58] the sentiment is very down the fud is
[02:01] very high um you know we have this
[02:03] correction and people think think it's
[02:06] over but this is this is all part of it
[02:08] right and like what has helped me doing
[02:11] doing the podcast and I think you have a
[02:13] similar experience right just talking to
[02:16] so many interesting smart motivated
[02:19] people that all in their own way and
[02:23] through their own motivations and and
[02:25] experiences right they are focusing
[02:28] their energy on on bitcoin and that
[02:33] figuring that out or finding that out or
[02:36] feeling feeling that movement basically
[02:39] um I think really helps me also in my
[02:41] conviction right like it's not just me
[02:44] I'm not crazy and you are not crazy
[02:46] right there there's many many people
[02:48] that um are seeing the problem of Fiat
[02:51] money and are curious enough to study
[02:55] they figure out Bitcoin and they decide
[02:56] to focus their their energy on it and I
[02:59] I I I think we are in a in a great flow
[03:02] with with Bitcoin a lot of stuff is
[03:05] happening of course recently we had the
[03:07] the really big news of the of the
[03:10] American you know strategic Bitcoin
[03:12] Reserve which if I think back 10 years
[03:15] that would have been a pipe wet pipe
[03:17] dream you know so we're we're we're
[03:20] seeing that and
[03:22] um yeah I think personally just focusing
[03:25] my energy on bitcoin has been amazing
[03:28] actually like I I think about this when
[03:30] when I wake up and I love that yeah just
[03:35] through my own output and enthusiasm
[03:37] I've been able to yeah create more time
[03:40] and space to even focus on it more so I
[03:42] think it's very rewarding and um again I
[03:45] think you have a similar experience but
[03:47] people sending me messages and comments
[03:48] on YouTube um saying that you know I
[03:51] really help them in in their journey and
[03:54] pointed them in certain directions for
[03:56] them to learn more yeah that's just
[03:58] super super super gratifying actually
[04:01] and I'm very grateful that just by
[04:04] servicing my own curiosity right just
[04:06] talking to other people having
[04:07] interesting conversations that I already
[04:10] learn from and then when you put it out
[04:12] on the internet you can actually reach
[04:13] way way more people like uh I've always
[04:17] called that in in my startup uh age in
[04:20] my career like the magic of the internet
[04:22] but with creating content it's the same
[04:24] like you never know how far a
[04:27] conversation reaches or what triggers
[04:30] which person and it's just really nice
[04:32] to see that um that feedback so I have
[04:35] to say like it's just it's just really
[04:37] rewarding and I know that it's the right
[04:39] decision to to focus more on on on
[04:43] bitcoin it's super interesting um for me
[04:46] it actually was Jeff poof the
[04:48] conversation I had with him um what
[04:52] the was there moment for you where you
[04:55] realized I have to not only put my money
[04:58] but also my time more into Bitcoin
[05:00] because there's like a huge differen a
[05:02] lot of people put that money but not
[05:04] that time in Bitcoin yes I saw um I have
[05:07] a very distinct moment where I realized
[05:10] I saw Bob Bernett uh who's a boomer BTC
[05:14] on on Twitter
[05:16] x uh well he's a boomer so he's
[05:18] somewhere in you know late late 60s and
[05:21] he shared on on a podcast um something
[05:25] like you know Bitcoin is the biggest
[05:26] thing that you could spend your time and
[05:28] energy on in your life right like it's
[05:30] it's the it's the biggest discovery of
[05:33] our of our lifetime and it's so profound
[05:35] that like the rest of your life you're
[05:37] going to think about this
[05:39] so there isn't a better way to spend
[05:41] your your time and energy than on this
[05:43] and and when I heard you know he said
[05:45] something like that and when I heard
[05:46] that I was like yeah I am going to think
[05:49] about this for the rest of my life you
[05:51] know this is not going this is not
[05:53] Bitcoin is not going away um the value
[05:57] that I'm getting from having adopt
[06:00] adopted it is is not going away and I
[06:03] want to see where this ends up but I
[06:07] also realized that it's not inevitable
[06:09] right like I well it's also interesting
[06:12] like whenever someone said that like oh
[06:14] Bitcoin is inevitable I I never really
[06:16] like that because you have to keep
[06:20] talking about Bitcoin I tweet that a lot
[06:22] like don't stop talking about
[06:24] Bitcoin it is inevitable because it
[06:26] exists but if you think about it in a
[06:30] kind of like a philosophical way it's we
[06:32] are manifesting it you know you and I
[06:34] are talking about it like Bitcoin was an
[06:36] idea in the beginning and and it was
[06:38] released you know on a random internet
[06:40] forum and people pick it up picked it up
[06:42] like the the entire growth is really
[06:44] organic but it comes from people that
[06:46] Focus their time and energy on either
[06:49] making it better or adopting it in a
[06:51] certain way or or teaching other people
[06:54] about it right and I feel like Bitcoin
[06:57] is like a collective a decentralized
[07:00] collective
[07:02] manifestation of this
[07:04] idea but it's only inevitable if we
[07:07] don't stop talking about it like we have
[07:09] to keep focusing and and pointing our
[07:12] energy towards that and then we will
[07:14] also see that it does accelerate right
[07:17] if we um I Heard um really interesting
[07:21] Reflection from Simon Dixon on the whole
[07:24] strategic Bitcoin reserve and how we
[07:26] basically manifested that into existence
[07:29] or memed it into existence right every
[07:31] time any
[07:33] official um text came out about like the
[07:37] crypto stock pile with with cardano and
[07:40] eth and whatever like people pile on to
[07:42] that on X and the people that are in
[07:45] charge of creating this legislation
[07:47] right like d David sax or or lotnik or
[07:52] you know the younger the younger people
[07:53] that are connected in the in the
[07:55] administration they read that stuff like
[07:57] you can reach those people you you know
[07:59] and so there's such a big force that is
[08:03] saying Bitcoin only Bitcoin only Bitcoin
[08:06] is the most profound discovery of Our
[08:07] Lifetime right this is how you can save
[08:10] America well in this context right and
[08:13] and and they they read it they notice it
[08:15] and eventually many people when they
[08:17] read this SBR you know legislation or
[08:20] draft legislation or the whole the whole
[08:22] executive order they're like yeah this
[08:24] is even better than we hoped for but
[08:27] that is because we talk about it
[08:30] you know and um I I think that is just
[08:34] such a fascinating thing and that's also
[08:36] why I'm happy that that you have a
[08:37] podcast you know we need even more
[08:39] Bitcoin podcast like we should just
[08:41] never stop talking about this thing
[08:42] because it will take a lot of time for
[08:47] Bitcoin to really beat Fiat money in my
[08:52] opinion the undertaking of you know
[08:57] having a superior form of money money a
[08:59] Superior Savings tool be adopted by the
[09:03] world is probably one of the biggest
[09:06] undertakings of any new technology right
[09:09] it's the biggest thing you know the
[09:11] whole question of what is money no one
[09:13] ever asks that themselves right I think
[09:15] you you you know that as well from your
[09:17] conversations and it's so big that we
[09:21] have to keep in mind that it will take
[09:22] some time and therefore we need to spend
[09:25] a lot of time helping to Manifest this
[09:29] idea further and further um into
[09:32] existence and so I hope that's an answer
[09:34] to the question actually but yeah I I
[09:36] had this profound moment where Bob
[09:37] Bernett said that and now I just
[09:39] realized this is a good decision because
[09:41] you cannot unsee Bitcoin right like you
[09:43] have to if you think this is going to
[09:45] change the world you you you are invited
[09:48] in such a strong and positive way to
[09:50] contribute to that that when you do it
[09:52] it doesn't even feel
[09:54] like work or something it feels like
[09:57] something you are supposed to
[10:00] that's super interesting and is also
[10:03] there's a lot in there um the first
[10:05] thing that that I want to tackle in
[10:07] there is um I always frame it as we are
[10:10] digital soldiers like we are in an
[10:12] information war and not like in an
[10:14] actual War I mean there still actual War
[10:16] but um most of the wars are now fight on
[10:21] uh Twitter and YouTube and podcasting
[10:24] but because there are different groups
[10:25] of different ideas and everyone wants to
[10:27] push their ideas uh and uh you are
[10:30] totally right if if we are becoming
[10:32] complacent and we just stop that's why I
[10:34] also don't like the idea of everyone
[10:36] using Nostra and no longer Twitter and
[10:38] YouTube because we we have to be where
[10:41] most people are on Twitter on Nostra
[10:43] there are enough orange pillars already
[10:45] I don't feel a big need to to go on
[10:47] Nostra I'm sometimes I am there uh but
[10:51] there you can convert the least amount
[10:53] of of bitcoiners because most people are
[10:56] already there H and the most people who
[10:59] actually reach on places like I think
[11:01] LinkedIn and Tik Tok there you have
[11:04] probably the most no no coiners and we
[11:06] are the the digital soldiers in in that
[11:08] war um which is also interesting um
[11:13] since I've been in the Bitcoin content
[11:16] space my knowledge about Bitcoin grew
[11:19] exponentially like I fought a new
[11:22] Bitcoin before now I know I didn't you
[11:24] anything how has been your experience in
[11:26] the in the past year with like
[11:29] interviewing so many people and actually
[11:31] growing your own knowledge uh around
[11:34] Bitcoin yeah great great question I love
[11:37] that to to to to touch back on the war
[11:40] part I uh I also got the word war from T
[11:43] the maester and he said I'm going to use
[11:45] the word War more um and I agree it's
[11:49] it's a battle right it's it's it's a
[11:51] battle of ideas the entire world is a is
[11:54] a battleground of ideas and for me that
[11:58] started started when I realized you know
[12:00] the people in the government are just
[12:02] other people you know and they also have
[12:04] their own ideas they they have an idea
[12:07] of what they want to achieve many also
[12:09] don't and they just you know compromise
[12:11] and they follow a system you know as
[12:13] also many people outside of the
[12:15] government right but the whole world is
[12:17] a is a battle of of ideas and if you
[12:19] think about that combined with you know
[12:23] you can just do things then it becomes
[12:26] obvious that if you have a
[12:29] solid idea and you have many people that
[12:33] understand this idea and they all talk
[12:36] and share about this idea in their own
[12:38] unique way they will in in time reach
[12:44] more other more people that identify
[12:46] with how those people share it right so
[12:49] you know we have somewhat of a similar
[12:51] audience but I think also a very
[12:53] different audience because how I talk
[12:54] about Bitcoin clicks different with with
[12:58] people than how you talk about Bitcoin
[12:59] and that's an amazing thing like that's
[13:01] why I just said like we need more
[13:03] Bitcoin podcast because it's it's really
[13:05] hard to have like one unified story
[13:09] around Bitcoin because you know money
[13:12] touches all these aspects of our lives
[13:15] and nobody really knows what money is
[13:17] right we just mentioned that and so this
[13:19] is such a big topic that I think it's
[13:23] actually um really great that there are
[13:26] so many people in a decentralized way
[13:28] right like what I said said we we are
[13:29] manifesting this as a as a decentralized
[13:33] collective but we don't even know all
[13:34] the people that contribute to the
[13:37] manifestation of Bitcoin which is which
[13:40] doesn't really matter also right and I I
[13:44] I just love that idea and I agree with
[13:47] you it's uh it's it's it's really a
[13:49] battle because if you see you know for
[13:52] example in Europe they want to launch
[13:53] their cbdc in October or something we
[13:56] had a was this video from Christine
[13:58] lagard like that is also an idea they
[14:00] think that's a great idea for whatever
[14:03] reason and I think we shouldn't really
[14:06] talk only about why it's bad you know
[14:10] because that's only finger pointing we
[14:12] should explain why Bitcoin is the escape
[14:17] hatch for many people to escape this
[14:20] this digital money prison basically that
[14:22] they want to um start up and so I agree
[14:27] with you and I'm I'm I'm I'm happy that
[14:29] we are both part of this you know this
[14:32] this this decentralized Collective and
[14:35] to go to your question like when you
[14:37] talk to other people it's it's
[14:39] actually I I love being on this side of
[14:42] the of the conversation
[14:45] because that those are moments where I
[14:47] get to like synthesize my own thoughts
[14:51] um that I had but that are also shaped
[14:54] by the conversations that I had with
[14:55] other people and I and so and so I think
[14:58] that like having having a podcast is a
[15:00] really nice I'd say in intellectual uh
[15:03] undertaking because you are constantly
[15:06] testing your own ideas and sharpening
[15:08] your own mind basically around this
[15:12] topic that is not hard there are no hard
[15:15] definitions does that make sense so it's
[15:18] it's my interpretation and how I
[15:20] translate it and then share it with
[15:22] other people that yeah touches certain
[15:25] people like like I just said and and you
[15:27] do you do the same and so I I think that
[15:30] having discussions and conversations
[15:32] around this actually helps everyone
[15:34] involved so not only the people having
[15:36] the conversation like you and me but
[15:37] also all the listeners into yeah just
[15:39] like shaping their shaping their
[15:41] thoughts and and what I love mainly
[15:43] about Bitcoin is that it's really about
[15:46] your own curiosity and your own study
[15:49] like if you're listening to this like
[15:52] don't believe me when I say I think
[15:54] Bitcoin is the most profound um you know
[15:56] technological Discovery over our
[15:58] lifetimes or whatever uh Robin is going
[16:00] to say the beauty of Bitcoin is that you
[16:03] can research and verify
[16:06] everything for yourself um I I've also
[16:10] tweeted I sent you this tweet right like
[16:12] um like Bitcoin is an asymmetrical
[16:14] opportunity based on publicly available
[16:16] information but you have to do the work
[16:19] you have to do the work you have to do
[16:21] the study and um yeah that is just
[16:25] really important then I think having
[16:27] conversations like like this and and how
[16:30] we have them on our podcast is uh
[16:33] eventually beneficial for for everyone
[16:35] and and I just love doing it like uh I I
[16:38] would do it privately but I think it's
[16:40] more beneficial if we share it on
[16:43] internet and hopefully help other people
[16:45] yeah that's that's amazing I always
[16:47] compare
[16:49] it someone recently asked me someone
[16:52] that completely knew nothing about me
[16:54] and he asked me oh what is a job and I'm
[16:55] like oh I'm a
[16:57] student because
[17:00] because that's basically what I do I
[17:01] just ask questions all day long and I
[17:04] was studying the past year 500 hours on
[17:07] my podcast with with so many people and
[17:09] I think that's that's the framing that I
[17:11] usually do uh and and I like that way
[17:14] more like what are you studying oh I
[17:15] study Bitcoin oh what university is
[17:17] allowing that YouTube yeah yeah yeah
[17:21] yeah amazing I love that uh but but that
[17:23] that that's just how I look at that um
[17:27] and it's also really interesting every
[17:29] time I speak with people outside of
[17:32] Bitcoin I realize how freaking early we
[17:35] are um do do you have some framework to
[17:38] think about to to give people an
[17:41] understanding of how early we actually
[17:43] are in terms of adoption yeah that's
[17:46] amaz an amazing question I um I want to
[17:50] say that I am very optimistic about
[17:54] Bitcoin and where it goes but I also
[17:56] think it will take a long time is a is
[18:00] is a is a weird thing to say because
[18:02] that along is different for for everyone
[18:05] but like I said I think the the the
[18:07] challenge that Bitcoin is
[18:10] on replacing you know the the broken
[18:14] Fiat money system and showing it's I I I
[18:18] see Bitcoin kind of like acting as a
[18:20] mirror right because it just exists
[18:22] that's why as Parker Lewis says you know
[18:25] Bitcoin is not a hedge Bitcoin is
[18:27] entirely different system that you can
[18:31] you can move to and as long as that
[18:34] system exists it is a mirror for for the
[18:37] Fiat money system so these these two
[18:39] systems they they just exist next to
[18:42] each other and what we just talked about
[18:46] right podcasts and educational efforts
[18:48] and meetups and stuff like that is to
[18:50] show people hey there is this other
[18:52] thing and it works like this and this
[18:55] and it's different than you know the
[18:57] Fiat money system because of X
[19:00] YZ and that's basically the only thing
[19:03] we can do because all these individual
[19:05] people need to think for themselves
[19:08] basically and compare for themselves
[19:11] what they want to do because once you
[19:15] understand Bitcoin you cannot unsee it
[19:17] right and so it still exists and there
[19:18] are more and more people you can see
[19:20] people move towards this new system
[19:23] there's for example this Mexican
[19:24] billionaire Ricardo selenos he says like
[19:27] I have 70 or 80% of my my net worth in
[19:29] Bitcoin for me that's a huge huge signal
[19:32] doesn't mean I blindly Mo move to
[19:34] bitcoin but it does solidify that there
[19:39] are very intelligent people that are
[19:41] focusing their time and energy more and
[19:43] more on bitcoin right but my point is
[19:45] that there's only so much that you can
[19:47] do for a certain individual and then
[19:49] they have to do their own work you know
[19:51] and take their their own leap and and
[19:54] make their own decisions Etc so I think
[19:58] that will take some time maybe I I'd
[20:01] love to get your answer on on this but I
[20:03] think there's only like a 100,000 people
[20:05] in the world that that really understand
[20:08] Bitcoin I think at the level that that
[20:10] we are at um so I'd love to hear your
[20:13] number but I talked to people and there
[20:14] are like no I think 10,000 there's other
[20:17] people that say like you know few
[20:19] million um so it's funny it's like it's
[20:22] like that's a big r it's a big range um
[20:26] but I also don't know so so on one side
[20:28] I think it's going to take very long
[20:30] because it's individual right it's
[20:32] individual after individual after
[20:33] individual and what is nice what is a
[20:36] good thing about that is that you know
[20:38] governments and big corporations Etc are
[20:41] all comprised of individuals right and
[20:44] so slowly but surely once you see
[20:46] Bitcoin and you cannot unsee it but you
[20:49] are like active in your fi job and you
[20:51] have like stupid meetings with 12
[20:53] people that are talking about nonsense
[20:56] and you're just sitting there like what
[20:57] the am I what the am I doing
[21:00] you know don't they know that you know
[21:04] the the money that they work for is
[21:06] created by other people infinitely you
[21:08] know and it's so that's a bad trade and
[21:09] you know whatever like so slowly but
[21:11] surely you're going to walk into not
[21:13] only yourself but also the environment
[21:15] that you're in and then eventually you
[21:17] get to a point where you have to you
[21:19] know you have that Matrix moment red
[21:20] pill blue pill you know and the blue
[21:22] pill is basically just going back to the
[21:25] to to the old life pretending you don't
[21:29] know that there's another thing that
[21:31] exists and I'd say if you're honest
[21:34] enough you can never never ever take the
[21:37] blue pill like the blue pill is the
[21:39] worst decision that you can make because
[21:41] you're basically cheating yourself you
[21:43] know there's a way out of the cage or
[21:46] the the cave you know play's cave that
[21:48] that you're in and you're consciously
[21:50] deciding not to pursue what is the
[21:53] harder path you're you're deciding to
[21:56] take the easy path but eventually that
[21:59] will create a hard life for you because
[22:01] you
[22:02] will still kind of like Peak at Bitcoin
[22:05] you see people that adopt Bitcoin I
[22:08] think we are all happier everyone is
[22:09] making babies everyone is positive about
[22:11] the future everyone is improving their
[22:14] their wealth
[22:16] right and so because it's it's such an
[22:19] individual journey I think it will take
[22:21] a long time I cannot really Define long
[22:25] but I think it is definitely
[22:29] one or two generations before I'd say
[22:33] Bitcoin is really embedded in society
[22:35] right if if the children that are like
[22:38] five now turn 18 or let's say 25 they
[22:42] grow up in a world where Bitcoin as that
[22:44] mirror has constantly existed right and
[22:47] so they will get to a certain point
[22:49] where they have to decide yeah which
[22:52] money am I going to use what am I going
[22:54] to use to save for my future Etc and
[22:59] I think I'm really interested to see
[23:01] where that goes and what will what will
[23:03] happen but if you then research right
[23:05] just Bitcoin is the is the most rational
[23:06] and logical conclusion that you will end
[23:09] up with but you have to get to that
[23:11] point where you are actually
[23:13] investigating that so I think that takes
[23:15] a long time on the other
[23:18] side I ALS I I do think because of you
[23:21] know the absolute scarcity in Bitcoin
[23:23] this concept of of a supply shock where
[23:27] growing and growing demand and meets
[23:30] this basically wall of
[23:33] hodlers because you know long-term
[23:36] hodlers I think like o like 60% or
[23:39] something of the all the Bitcoin hasn't
[23:40] moved in three years like all these
[23:42] people know what this is and I think
[23:44] that percentage is very high actually
[23:47] and so there will come a point where
[23:51] continuous buying from either more
[23:55] individuals or larger entities I I think
[23:57] it'll be larg lger
[23:59] entities will result in a supply shock
[24:02] that will really blow up the
[24:04] price and I don't I'm not really a price
[24:07] person so I don't know what the target
[24:09] is right
[24:10] but yeah that that is just logical right
[24:13] it'll it'll hit a certain wall of
[24:15] hodlers that are like yeah sell my
[24:17] Bitcoin for what you know whatever the
[24:20] price because I'd say the smart hodlers
[24:23] will eventually move towards
[24:25] borrowing dirty Fiat against their bit
[24:28] Bitcoin and they will never never sell
[24:30] the Bitcoin I think they will
[24:32] participate in a Bitcoin economy but
[24:34] they will never sell the Bitcoin for for
[24:36] Fiat again and just logically reasoning
[24:39] I think there will be a point in the in
[24:43] the future that is within the next 10
[24:46] years where we will see one or many of
[24:50] those Supply shocks basically where it
[24:53] will become clear that this absolute
[24:58] finite asset has a growing demand an
[25:02] Unstoppable demand that will show its
[25:05] value in you know preserving wealth and
[25:08] and that eventually will also make that
[25:11] that the price will will blow or you
[25:13] know will go go to the upside so I'm
[25:15] kind of torn in between does that make
[25:18] sense there is there are so many
[25:20] interesting things in there um uh first
[25:23] of all because uh I think I didn't show
[25:26] it too much in in in the podcast first
[25:28] uh there is something as you uh pointed
[25:31] to the there huddle waves where you can
[25:33] actually see like how long the the hle
[25:36] periods are I think those charts are
[25:38] just really cool to see and you can see
[25:41] like the hle periods 10 years obviously
[25:43] it's it's only starting uh 2015 and it's
[25:47] like so if you go to two three or 3 five
[25:49] if you go to three five I'd say two
[25:51] three are definitely people that
[25:53] understand what this is right so
[25:54] anything above I'd say let's say
[25:58] everything above 3 years I I would say
[26:01] those are people that know what what
[26:03] what this is they went through the whole
[26:05] draw down they went back up they have it
[26:08] now a second big big draw down or maybe
[26:11] even a third actually yeah then you know
[26:13] you know what this is so I don't know
[26:15] can you can you go there like between
[26:17] like three three and up you mean here
[26:20] yeah and then and then we have to count
[26:21] the other ones right exactly but this is
[26:24] probably towards
[26:26] 60% is exactly
[26:29] yeah and that's super interesting uh of
[26:32] the hle Wes there's also one aspect that
[26:34] I don't know how or if they capture it
[26:36] even because I in my now almost five
[26:42] year journey in Bitcoin have changed my
[26:45] cust setup multiple times uh so I
[26:50] basically transferred my Bitcoin to
[26:53] other wallets so uh on on chain it seems
[26:57] like I sold or moved my Bitcoin every
[27:01] other year uh so if you even take that
[27:04] into account I think the numbers of of
[27:07] Bitcoin hoders that actually are hling
[27:09] is probably even bigger than those hle
[27:12] waves but this gives an an rough
[27:14] estimation where we are so that that's
[27:16] super interesting and do your question
[27:18] that because I think it's an interesting
[27:20] question of how many people actually
[27:21] understand Bitcoin um I have two ways uh
[27:25] to look at that and I look at from from
[27:29] down of like okay how how many are are
[27:32] there at minimum uh and from what I from
[27:35] what I see there are at least a thousand
[27:38] people that are that at least speaking
[27:41] publicly around Bitcoin so I think
[27:43] that's kind of the for me the the
[27:46] minimum amount of people that that
[27:48] understand Bitcoin and then from the
[27:51] okay what what is kind of the maximum
[27:53] number of how many people understand
[27:56] actually Bitcoin um treasure actually uh
[28:00] published something interesting at the
[28:03] last year of uh Bitcoin prag conference
[28:06] uh they said from all the bitcoiners out
[28:08] there only 2% have a hardware
[28:12] wallet and and and I was super shocked
[28:15] at that number and I was I was not
[28:16] believing it honestly uh but I believe
[28:19] that treasure have done good research uh
[28:23] so if if we assume that that number is
[28:25] actually correct 2% of like let's say
[28:28] say 100 million people or 150 million
[28:30] people around 3 million people uh 3
[28:32] million
[28:33] devices uh or 3 million people that did
[28:36] it uh so my absolute maximum of how many
[28:39] people actually understood it would not
[28:42] be three million because not everyone
[28:43] that just bought a treasure Hardware
[28:45] wallet has understand Bitcoin so I think
[28:48] a million people is probably the the
[28:50] maximum of how many people understood it
[28:52] so I think 100,000 is actually a good
[28:55] guess somewhere in the middle range of
[28:57] like how many people are speaking
[28:59] publicly about it how many people have
[29:01] some kind of a self- custody setup uh
[29:04] and and somewhere in between is probably
[29:06] the truth it's obviously impossible to
[29:08] know exactly um but I have a fun
[29:11] addition to that I think I'm I'm I'm
[29:13] looking it up now uh if I look up the
[29:17] hellin Tweet running Bitcoin let's take
[29:19] a break for a moment and appreciate the
[29:22] puty that coin vigilante has made with
[29:25] the Bitcoin watches those watches the
[29:28] most amazing the most elegent way of
[29:31] showing that you are a true bitcoiner
[29:34] and coin vigilante just dropped a
[29:36] completely new and amazing Genesis
[29:39] edition of their watch collections you
[29:42] have the date of the first ever mined
[29:45] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[29:48] also the block height and which EPO we
[29:51] are currently in I love the level of
[29:53] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[29:56] make sure to check out those amazing
[29:59] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[30:02] descriptions I love those watches so so
[30:05] much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[30:07] really do hope that you don't have it on
[30:10] Exchange but if you do have it on
[30:11] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[30:14] with that the first way is you put it on
[30:16] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[30:18] you to get into the self- custody game I
[30:22] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[30:25] for that it's a super simple and Q way
[30:28] and if you check out the link in the
[30:30] description you even get 5% off if you
[30:33] use the code Robin and the second way is
[30:36] the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is your
[30:39] all-in partner in terms of how to get
[30:42] the most out of your sovereignty they
[30:45] will personalize for you a self- custody
[30:48] setup that is perfect for your
[30:51] individual situation they will show you
[30:53] how you can secure your own devices
[30:56] securing your Bitcoin is not enough you
[30:58] also have to keep all your devices
[31:00] secure one topic that is overlooked
[31:03] often is the inheritance plan what
[31:05] happens with your Bitcoin once you are
[31:08] no longer here do you have a plan for
[31:11] that in place already and last but not
[31:13] least if you're in jurisdictions where
[31:15] you don't feel safe it's better to get a
[31:18] plan B for all that head over to the
[31:20] Bitcoin
[31:22] weight.com robobin to get a 30 minute
[31:25] free call and just a quick side note I
[31:28] will be for the first time ever speaking
[31:31] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June it
[31:34] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[31:37] really looking forward to seeing all of
[31:38] you there you can get your ticket in the
[31:41] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[31:44] BR and very important use code Robin to
[31:47] get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[31:50] looking forward seeing you there I saw a
[31:52] tweet of of someone who quote posted uh
[31:55] this famous tweet right from January 11
[31:58] 2009 hell finny says running Bitcoin it
[32:01] has 125,000 likes so I'd say you know if
[32:04] if you know that history if you if you
[32:06] know the significance of that post and
[32:09] you like
[32:10] it then you probably are are are deep
[32:14] into Bitcoin to a degree where you
[32:16] understand it I'm doing air quotes
[32:17] because can you fully understand it no
[32:19] um when I say you know that understand
[32:21] Bitcoin I'd say the profoundness and the
[32:23] possible impact you know the
[32:25] profoundness of the discovery and the
[32:26] possible impact on the world
[32:29] yeah 125k people that like that post I
[32:33] think comes close you
[32:35] know yeah then then you add a small
[32:38] amount of people that might might not
[32:41] have liked it or just seen it or might
[32:43] just uh not being on on Twitter so like
[32:45] 100 to 200k why why not that's a good
[32:49] good reasonable guess I love that
[32:51] actually looking at that number yeah
[32:53] that was a good that was a good post
[32:55] maybe maybe something fun to add because
[32:56] I have a friend uh uh in real life that
[32:59] you also talked to on the podcast Lao um
[33:02] who I think there was a really
[33:04] interesting episode with with you and
[33:06] Lao by the way because Lao has done lots
[33:09] and lots of historical research also on
[33:13] you know the failures of certain
[33:15] monetary systems and a lot also about
[33:18] wear Republic Etc and um so I would um
[33:24] invite anyone to to check out that
[33:26] episode that you two had because I uh uh
[33:28] I I like my conversation with him too
[33:30] but I think yours was was was even
[33:31] better um he sees Bitcoin as when I talk
[33:37] to
[33:38] him the I the idea of Bitcoin in my head
[33:42] and the impact on the world grows
[33:44] because I talk with him like he sees it
[33:46] even even bigger right and when we
[33:49] connect that um when we connect that to
[33:53] how how early we are and what the upside
[33:55] potential is what what is the
[33:57] asymmetrical opportunity that people
[33:59] have based on Public Information is that
[34:02] if you think about and and also another
[34:05] thing comes into play here the the full
[34:07] potential value uh blog post by Jesse
[34:11] Meyers bitcoin's full potential value
[34:12] everyone should check that out maybe
[34:14] some people know the image with the
[34:16] little blocks like where you know how
[34:19] what is all the wealth in the world it's
[34:20] like 900 trillion half of that is cash
[34:23] and then the other half is like stored
[34:25] in in real estate art stocks Etc
[34:29] gold and um his full potential valuation
[34:34] is trillion for Bitcoin which is 100x
[34:39] right which is 10 million per
[34:42] Bitcoin and how he explains that is you
[34:46] know what we just talked about if more
[34:47] and more people figure out that there's
[34:49] this parallel system that kind of
[34:55] emphasizes all the flaws in the other
[34:57] system in the Fiat money system and
[34:59] shows how it's Superior verifiable for
[35:02] everyone then slowly but surely more
[35:04] people realize that Bitcoin is a
[35:08] superior store of value Asset first and
[35:12] and a better medium of exchange after
[35:14] but but that that is even further down
[35:16] the road I think because the store of
[35:19] value use case is the most clear for
[35:23] people right now you know saving is debt
[35:26] if you really want to invest
[35:28] um you have to make like 13 plus% on
[35:33] your money in the stock market if you
[35:35] want if you really want to combat um the
[35:38] monetary debasement of the last 10 years
[35:41] right so anyway the point is slowly but
[35:43] surely like like I just shared you know
[35:45] more and more people will figure out hey
[35:47] this Bitcoin thing is a better way to
[35:48] store my value and Jesse's piece is
[35:52] about getting to 200 trillion based on
[35:55] fairly conservative estimates about
[35:58] um you know how how how much of a
[36:00] percentage will go away from art or from
[36:03] other Collectibles or gold or homes Etc
[36:05] well he ends up with 200 trillion as a
[36:09] uh what has been stored in Bitcoin which
[36:12] eventually gets to 10 million per
[36:14] Bitcoin although we know a lot of
[36:15] Bitcoin are are lost right so it's
[36:17] probably closer to like 12 13 million
[36:20] per per
[36:21] Bitcoin but the point is when I talk to
[36:23] Lao he
[36:24] says if you realize that probably less
[36:27] than a million people right now in the
[36:30] entire world have one
[36:32] Bitcoin and you think that what Jesse
[36:36] talks about where we are moving or how
[36:39] much value is going to move into Bitcoin
[36:42] the fact that you are here and you are
[36:45] you are one of those one million people
[36:47] that's I I love the British hle message
[36:49] of get to one Bitcoin you know having
[36:51] one Bitcoin is more special than being a
[36:53] millionaire already numbers wise okay
[36:58] because there are 57 or 60 million
[37:01] millionaires in the world and if there's
[37:03] only one people that have one million
[37:05] people that have one Bitcoin it it it's
[37:08] extremely special to have one Bitcoin
[37:12] and there will be a moment where more
[37:13] millionaires will figure that out I've
[37:15] now used this argument on three
[37:18] millionaires asking them how many
[37:20] millionaires do you think there are in
[37:21] the world 57 or 60 million I say and how
[37:24] many Bitcoin are there 21 million Okay
[37:27] so if you want the Bitcoin if you have a
[37:30] Bitcoin and you talk to another
[37:31] millionaire you can be like oh that's a
[37:33] nice new Porsche but do you have one
[37:35] Bitcoin no I do you know and then you
[37:37] can tell that to that other person I've
[37:38] used this as an argument and it's worked
[37:41] that's funny it's like an ego thing but
[37:43] the point is more when La talks about
[37:46] this he talks about you can almost not
[37:49] imagine
[37:51] how big of a deal it is if Bitcoin
[37:55] actually gets to that 200 trillion
[37:58] market cap if all that value is stored
[38:01] in Bitcoin that solidifies
[38:05] Bitcoin in our society in in our world
[38:09] and if you are here right now and you do
[38:12] the work and you study and you adopt
[38:14] Bitcoin right now and you do everything
[38:16] in your power by spending your time and
[38:19] energy on earning money and turning that
[38:21] into Bitcoin you will eventually get to
[38:24] a level of wealth that you cannot
[38:25] imagine and Lao always talk about we
[38:28] will all have our private chefs our
[38:30] private doctors our private contractors
[38:33] all these things and all these people
[38:35] will be
[38:38] bitcoiners and I just love it when I
[38:41] talk to him that that's eventually my
[38:43] point like and and also why I like
[38:46] having discussions about Bitcoin is you
[38:48] get challenged so much about thinking
[38:50] about okay how big is this and again
[38:52] going back to that question of what is
[38:54] what is money and what what are all the
[38:56] things that it touches is right what if
[38:58] we can actually show more people that
[39:00] this is a superior money system and they
[39:02] all move there what does that implicate
[39:04] what happens then you know and for me
[39:07] that's just been really rewarding in an
[39:10] intellectual way like it's just really
[39:11] enjoyable and a very positive and
[39:14] intriguing thing to research and um and
[39:19] and pursue and when I when someone else
[39:22] puts a concept so big in my head of
[39:25] where Bitcoin can go um I'm like
[39:28] instantly energized again and I have
[39:30] this like renewed enthusiasm to also go
[39:33] out and figure out like okay could this
[39:35] really be it why why does he say that
[39:37] you know and so it's just a rabbit hole
[39:40] that keeps on going in that sense
[39:42] absolutely yeah and it's it's kind of it
[39:47] it's so great when you have those
[39:49] Bitcoin conversation you're like oh like
[39:51] it makes so much sense uh but what I see
[39:54] is that people don't even get the
[39:56] problem like the ution Bitcoin is is
[39:58] then the next step but um it's almost
[40:01] hard to explain uh especially in the
[40:04] western world where it's still fine like
[40:08] inflation is bad but people think it's
[40:10] it's just temporary it will go off again
[40:12] it's just because of Ukraine war and
[40:15] like I heard that that saying a lot they
[40:17] they almost don't get they don't even
[40:19] get the problem uh then it's really hard
[40:21] to understand the solution how has been
[40:25] your experience with with getting people
[40:26] to understand understand the the problem
[40:28] especially in in the western world I
[40:30] mean the the figure that I just
[40:33] mentioned you know I saw um Tad Smith
[40:36] who's the former CEO of sales he was on
[40:39] a podcast with Tim cman and it was this
[40:42] clip that went uh pretty viral from that
[40:45] podcast where he explained so he's a
[40:47] business guy he ran multiple uh you know
[40:52] billion dollar
[40:54] companies and he's actually a business
[40:56] professor and he said it took me until I
[40:59] was like
[41:00] 55 to figure out
[41:03] that if the money supply is
[41:06] increased by a little over 10% you know
[41:11] each
[41:11] year in real terms and the return of the
[41:15] S&P 500 is 9 something perc that I'm
[41:19] actually losing purchasing power so even
[41:22] with all that background and all that
[41:24] experience plus the age right
[41:27] it took him to his late 50s to figure
[41:32] that out and when I
[41:33] hear things like that I I think I have
[41:37] more empathy for people that don't
[41:39] understand it yet because I also feel
[41:41] very lucky that I've figured that out in
[41:44] some way before I'm 55 you know and I'm
[41:47] able to act on it but yeah I I mean I I
[41:52] was never taught about money or Finance
[41:54] or economics and I mean I've talked to
[41:57] people people who are Masters in
[41:58] economics and they tell me yeah I never
[42:01] I was calculating units and stuff you
[42:04] know in in in my study but we never
[42:07] really discussed what money
[42:09] is and I mean if a masters in economics
[42:12] has never uh learned that then how can
[42:16] you expect that you know a general
[42:17] person like you you you and me that that
[42:20] we would know that right as early as
[42:24] possible I'd say in like the the the
[42:27] adolescence part or the working part of
[42:29] your life where actually money becomes a
[42:32] a thing in in your life you know and
[42:35] so
[42:37] um yeah this this is um this is also how
[42:40] I think like we should not talk we
[42:42] should not you don't pitch Bitcoin right
[42:45] you don't say oh it's a better money or
[42:47] something like that because most people
[42:49] don't even know what money is they think
[42:51] you know the bank notes in their pocket
[42:53] are money but that's not money you know
[42:56] and
[42:58] yeah I think this is what we should
[42:59] focus on more eventually and I love I
[43:02] don't know if you talked to him yet I
[43:03] think I have a uh recording scheduled
[43:06] with with Joe Brian uh who made a video
[43:09] called what's the problem on YouTube and
[43:11] I think it's called what's the problem
[43:13] why we all need Bitcoin I think you
[43:15] should drop the why we all need Bitcoin
[43:17] part from the title and make something
[43:20] more like what's the problem with money
[43:22] or something like that that to me has
[43:24] been the best explainer video that I've
[43:26] seen in the past 10 years I'd say really
[43:31] to a level where people can follow a
[43:34] story and see the implications of
[43:37] certain decisions for picking a certain
[43:39] money system um it's a little story
[43:42] revolving around like a a crash on an
[43:46] island and there's two groups of people
[43:48] and they each adopt a different money
[43:50] and he doesn't even mention Bitcoin
[43:51] until like the last 60 seconds which is
[43:54] great but yeah even a video like that
[43:58] maybe I don't know it has 150,000
[44:00] 200,000 views you know in in in the
[44:02] global scale that's nothing yet although
[44:05] the content is really really good and
[44:07] for many people I'd say it would be a
[44:10] real eye opener after they watch it it's
[44:12] literally 31 minutes right so who who
[44:14] cannot watch a video of 31 minutes and
[44:16] pay attention um and yeah well that's
[44:19] why I say it's an asymmetric opportunity
[44:21] based on Public Information you can
[44:22] actually find all the information all
[44:23] the information is there and and to
[44:25] different degrees and levels there's
[44:27] people on YouTube and analysts on
[44:29] Twitter that share you know the insights
[44:32] from their expertise and as long as you
[44:34] are curious and really yeah I mean I
[44:37] know you have to put in the time but
[44:38] eventually you are able to put
[44:41] everything together based on this public
[44:43] information but um yeah if I'm honest
[44:45] it's just really hard it's really hard
[44:47] that video is actually really good as
[44:49] soon as I saw it I sent it actually to
[44:51] my sister oh and because I was like hey
[44:55] maybe it triggers something like what
[44:57] what's the problem and yeah I did
[44:59] already I think a month ago with with
[45:01] him a video he's not only in the video
[45:05] uh what's the problem really good in
[45:07] explaining it and is very professional
[45:10] he's also a great speaker actually and a
[45:12] great podcast guest he was now on so
[45:13] many podcasts already and and and he was
[45:16] on on mine also on on uh on you know
[45:20] monigo and he's really good I also
[45:23] watched other podcasts with him and he's
[45:25] really good in like coming up with new
[45:27] ideas and like he's he's a great speaker
[45:29] I think he's really underrated actually
[45:31] um in terms of of of the Bitcoin
[45:34] speakers um and he is making
[45:38] it understandable what the as the title
[45:42] said what's the problem what I
[45:44] understand like why is feed so bad and
[45:47] and he really nicely covers that area
[45:51] and I think that's a great video of not
[45:54] this uh the the original one the the the
[45:57] 39 minute one of of his what's the
[45:59] problem that's just an amazing video If
[46:01] ever someone tells you all like hey like
[46:05] what's the problem with a VI system or
[46:07] someone uh really doesn't get it just
[46:10] send him this video and if he actually
[46:12] cares and watches it there's no way he's
[46:15] honest and open to the idea and watches
[46:18] 39 minutes of that and still doesn't see
[46:21] it uh he he has to has an agenda or not
[46:24] being open to it to actually not see it
[46:28] after watching this video I think it
[46:29] couldn't be clearer than that yeah I I I
[46:33] I fully agree but that's also why I said
[46:35] like if even this video is a little red
[46:39] pill I mean if you watch this video
[46:42] really with
[46:44] attention
[46:45] the conclusion that you get from it is
[46:50] really messed up actually the
[46:52] understanding you can get from just
[46:54] watching this video is pretty messed up
[46:57] and yeah like I said I I think it's
[46:58] already a little red pill because if you
[47:01] just think like okay so if what he is
[47:04] sharing here is you know an illustration
[47:08] of how the world that I'm personally
[47:10] acting in is actually constructed and
[47:13] I'm forced to use a money that other
[47:16] people that are no smarter than me that
[47:18] don't really care about my individual
[47:20] life like I care for my individual life
[47:22] if those people can create that what I
[47:25] use for money infinite
[47:27] and spend it before I can spend it and
[47:30] therefore you know debase the money that
[47:32] I already have if that is really true
[47:37] what do I do about that that's a
[47:39] crossroad right because ignoring it is
[47:42] also a choice it's a very bad is a easy
[47:45] choice but it's a very bad choice
[47:47] because you cannot
[47:49] ignore that it's that that that Paradigm
[47:52] is true right so you are in that right
[47:55] so the only thing you can do is either
[47:56] accept that and then you are instantly
[47:59] forced to figure out what am I doing
[48:02] with that right so then you have to yeah
[48:05] continue studying or reading or what
[48:07] asking questions or listening to podcast
[48:09] or whatever so you're instantly on that
[48:10] path
[48:12] or you ignore it and even when you go to
[48:16] the grocery store a day later you know
[48:19] and you pick a few items just a quick
[48:21] lunch or a quick dinner and you have to
[48:22] pay like 50 and you still feel that's
[48:25] wrong and then you you again have that
[48:27] point right where you can be like oh
[48:29] maybe maybe there's something in this
[48:31] video that I saw right that that could
[48:33] be true I need to understand why is this
[48:35] happening or you're still ignoring it
[48:37] right and that's yeah I I just love
[48:40] thinking about this because Bitcoin in
[48:41] that sense is a true ego test it's like
[48:44] as as long as you keep ignoring
[48:48] it or going actively against it while
[48:52] you also have the information about you
[48:55] know the problem that exists and how it
[48:57] works the only thing you're sabotaging
[48:59] is is is yourself right is is a true
[49:03] yeah red pill blue pill kind of like ego
[49:06] psychological Journey that each
[49:08] individual goes through um differently
[49:11] and yeah if you don't have 33 minutes to
[49:14] watch this video then um yeah I think
[49:18] this video could really change your life
[49:19] so I would invite everyone to to check
[49:22] it out it's like it's like one of those
[49:23] videos like in 39 minutes for the rest
[49:26] of of your 39 years or something you
[49:28] know those
[49:29] videos a fun title that also if you look
[49:33] at um
[49:35] um at Joe for example right I'm I was
[49:38] trying to look up his his education
[49:40] actually because I think he is a yeah
[49:43] he's a
[49:44] physics he he he he is a physics major
[49:48] right so again a super intelligent
[49:51] person who's actually also very
[49:53] successful in
[49:54] business just decides
[49:57] to put their all their attention and
[49:59] energy towards Bitcoin and if you ask
[50:02] yourself why is that then I think you're
[50:04] also possibly on the first step of your
[50:07] own Rabbit Hole Journey right because
[50:09] there is a reason why would you pay
[50:11] attention to something that's not worth
[50:13] paying attention to you know so uh Lex
[50:15] Freedman said something a few years on
[50:18] on the podcast which kind of stuck with
[50:20] me uh in in my orange spilling story he
[50:23] said like I don't fully yet get Bitcoin
[50:26] but one thing is clear every Bitcoin is
[50:28] super smart that I talk to and so there
[50:31] has to be something there and that's an
[50:34] interesting um observation that that he
[50:37] made it's also one thing that kind of uh
[50:39] orange spilled me in my journey of like
[50:42] Lex Freedman I think orange was
[50:44] interviewing cedine years ago it was a
[50:47] really great one also um so like the it
[50:51] it brings me to I had I had a different
[50:54] question plan but uh do do you think
[50:56] that Bitcoin is more a social Revolution
[50:59] or a technical one oh good good one I
[51:04] will I will I will answer but with what
[51:07] we just said right like there's
[51:08] something going on there you know and if
[51:11] you actually you know you said there's
[51:12] something going on there and again
[51:14] there's only two options this is kind of
[51:15] how my mind works either yes there's
[51:17] really something going on there and
[51:19] everything they say yeah it's kind of
[51:21] rooted in in in truth plus reality plus
[51:24] rationality so hm I got to pick pay
[51:26] attention to this or they're all crazy
[51:29] they're participating in a pyramid
[51:30] scheme or Ponzi scheme they're
[51:32] idiots right even even Paul tutor Jones
[51:35] even Stanley dram Miller even Ricardo
[51:37] salinos even Michael
[51:40] sailor you know so it's it's either or
[51:44] or it's it's it's it's it's it's the one
[51:46] or the other right and that's what I
[51:49] love you know you just mentioned
[51:50] LinkedIn is in talking to to people that
[51:53] that you know where you will probably
[51:55] find people that could use Bitcoin the
[51:57] most dude so so many haters on LinkedIn
[52:01] so many crazy like certified financial
[52:03] advisers and blah blah and they're like
[52:05] oh Bitcoin is a Ponzi Bitcoin is a tulip
[52:07] scheme Bitcoin is a is a scam
[52:10] and again if we go back to you know
[52:13] what's
[52:14] the what what's the psychological thing
[52:16] that's going on here it's so easy to
[52:18] dismiss of
[52:19] course you know but if you then see
[52:22] these people use reasoning that's just
[52:26] stupid you know you know they didn't do
[52:28] the work and so they you see self
[52:31] sabotage in real time you know and
[52:34] they're also keeping other people away
[52:37] from honestly investigating hey what is
[52:40] what is going on here is there something
[52:42] going on here right and so that's kind
[52:45] of how my mind works that that a lot of
[52:47] times you can just bring things back to
[52:50] yeah it's either this or it's this right
[52:53] there there's of course there's a lot of
[52:55] gray in the world but
[52:57] yeah we are either idiots that are
[52:59] victim to a Ponzi scheme and a pyramid
[53:01] scheme and a
[53:03] cult without you know us knowing we are
[53:06] totally you know Enchanted by the
[53:08] Bitcoin
[53:10] thing or this is really the biggest
[53:13] technological
[53:14] monetary Discovery and revolution of our
[53:17] lifetimes you know it's it's it's one or
[53:21] or or the other of course I gravitate
[53:24] towards the the ladder and you you
[53:27] to but there are many people that um
[53:31] yeah just think in that way and I think
[53:33] it's it's just Such a Pity you know like
[53:36] um yeah you should just be I mean I'm I
[53:39] think I'm I'm happy and I'm lucky that I
[53:41] am wired in a certain way that makes me
[53:43] curious and so I go on my little rabbit
[53:46] hole Journeys but there are many people
[53:48] that just think like oh there's a guy
[53:50] who's something with Finance on LinkedIn
[53:52] said it's a permit scheme I'm just not
[53:54] going to pay attention and yeah still
[53:55] going to pay 50 again in the supermarket
[53:58] for quick launch you know
[54:00] um but yeah I I just want to mention
[54:03] that because that again is a signal
[54:06] right so even if people are listening
[54:08] and think like oh what are these guys
[54:10] talking about I would invite you to just
[54:11] do your own research again you can find
[54:14] everything online you don't really have
[54:15] to please do not believe us right like
[54:18] we are the only cult cult where we ask
[54:20] people to think for themselves and not
[54:22] follow follow us basically that's always
[54:24] my reply when someone says you know
[54:26] you're in a cold Etc um so yeah I just
[54:29] want to add to that because I like that
[54:31] that you said that like when you think
[54:33] is there something there that's the
[54:35] signal like that's the signal for
[54:36] yourself too like go go deeper and and
[54:39] deeper and yeah because I rambled on
[54:41] this answer I um forgot your
[54:43] question no worries yeah it's the the
[54:46] the open sourness um and one thing I
[54:50] just add that quickly um usually when I
[54:53] encounter someone critical or hating on
[54:56] bitcoin I don't try to argue with them
[54:59] because usually it's useless I try to
[55:03] actually understand what where they're
[55:05] coming from and and what they're saying
[55:07] so I just ask questions and what I
[55:11] discovered is after the fourth
[55:14] question they are in a circle and they
[55:17] just repeat uh over and over that one
[55:19] argument so basically after four
[55:22] questions they canot go deeper if you
[55:24] ask a Bitcoin or why Bitcoin makes sense
[55:26] they can go very deep like question I
[55:30] don't know 250 if you have time to do
[55:32] that I don't know uh and and that's
[55:35] that's also one of the sickness ask ask
[55:38] Hayden I don't know if I shared that
[55:40] with you before but that's actually how
[55:42] I got into Bitcoin I believe Bitcoin was
[55:44] a scam for three years straight uh from
[55:46] 2017 to 2020 and then a non-bitcoin
[55:50] asked me why I hate Bitcoin and he asked
[55:53] me so much even though he was not in
[55:55] Bitcoin uh that I was experiencing
[55:58] myself like oh like I actually don't
[55:59] have good arguments and I wanted to find
[56:01] good arguments against Bitcoin and then
[56:03] discover Bitcoin in the process yeah uh
[56:05] and so if you just ask haters um deeper
[56:09] and deeper questions of like why they
[56:11] hate Bitcoin and what does not make
[56:13] sense of like just just not provoking
[56:16] not provoking questions otherwise it
[56:17] will just be emotional but actually
[56:19] curious intellectual questions you will
[56:22] see that either he goes in defense mode
[56:25] and then it's like conversation is over
[56:27] you you don't have a chance there or he
[56:29] actually realizes oh like interesting
[56:31] point of like I I I actually don't have
[56:34] any answers more so like uh just asking
[56:37] them is is a a really good point I think
[56:40] yeah yeah yeah I agree I fully agree
[56:43] absolutely um the question uh if I
[56:47] remember correctly that I asked before
[56:49] was if you see Bitcoin as a social
[56:51] Revolution or as a technical one yeah oh
[56:55] yeah so great question I and I think we
[56:57] covered some of that before right so
[57:00] okay so Bitcoin is this idea right that
[57:02] is actually like 40 or maybe even 70
[57:06] years in the making right from cryp
[57:08] cryptography and all the attempts that
[57:10] people have done at like the different
[57:14] technologies that eventually are
[57:15] combined um in in in Bitcoin and what I
[57:21] know from you know again my the startup
[57:24] part of of my career and what what we
[57:26] also talked about you have to like you
[57:28] can create a thing in this world that
[57:31] also might have a good you know reason
[57:33] of existence and actually be the best
[57:37] solution to the problem that you say it
[57:39] is solving but if nobody understands why
[57:42] they need it they will never adopt it
[57:46] right so if if I have an idea for some
[57:49] startup and I think it's great it's the
[57:51] best thing in the world you know people
[57:54] don't wake up in the morning think like
[57:55] hey I I'm going to buy what brah is
[57:58] making because you know that he really
[58:00] knows the the problem that I have and he
[58:02] made something that really solves it
[58:04] like that's just not how it works so for
[58:05] any company if you have an idea about a
[58:08] product you have to go into the market
[58:11] and get information as to you know how
[58:14] much do you actually understand the
[58:16] market how much do they do the people
[58:19] how how much does the market understand
[58:21] about the supposed problem that I think
[58:23] that they are having and in there
[58:24] somewhere you will find a match as to
[58:28] how you should talk right what's the
[58:29] proposition of your product what does it
[58:31] solve what does it do what does it cost
[58:35] um that matches with the understanding
[58:40] of the problem of the people in the
[58:41] market because if they then um are
[58:45] confronted with my proposition they're
[58:46] like hey it seems like brah understands
[58:50] what I'm constantly thinking about you
[58:52] know the problem that that keeps
[58:53] returning in in my head and so
[58:57] as someone who creates something in the
[58:59] world you have to understand what people
[59:02] want and we just talked about that right
[59:05] so even if Bitcoin started as this
[59:09] obscure post project random idea on a
[59:13] random internet Forum with
[59:15] people at a fringe of society right it
[59:19] might be the best money to ever exist
[59:23] exist but if no one knows about it and
[59:27] no one understands why it exists then it
[59:30] also won't be adopted right so yes the
[59:34] thing that is created the technological
[59:37] thing that is created um is
[59:40] important but I'd say it's not the most
[59:42] important part that social part you know
[59:46] people getting
[59:48] educated uh doubting their own
[59:50] preconceptions and beliefs and making up
[59:52] their own mind and start thinking for
[59:54] themselves right everything I think weal
[59:56] talked about up until this point I think
[59:58] is is more important because eventually
[60:01] so not only for the adoption of the
[60:03] technology but also because and and we
[60:05] also just mentioned this you cannot
[60:07] unsee this like this is a topic you know
[60:11] where if you understand the problem and
[60:14] you make the conscious decision that you
[60:16] do not want to be the person
[60:19] experiencing that problem which is a
[60:22] continuously debasing currency that
[60:26] makes your future more and more
[60:30] uncertain over time if you want to solve
[60:34] that problem and consciously make a
[60:36] decision that you want to solve that
[60:38] problem only then you will
[60:41] see the solution that is Bitcoin the
[60:44] technical solution that is Bitcoin there
[60:46] are also competing Solutions there are
[60:49] alternatives to bitcoin doing nothing is
[60:52] an alternative right just a conscious
[60:54] decision of doing nothing is a is a
[60:56] decision going into art or homes or gold
[61:00] whatever is is is it's an alternative
[61:03] solution to the same uh problem and so
[61:06] Bitcoin is
[61:07] also competing in the marketplace of
[61:10] solutions with all these other Solutions
[61:14] which we think are inferior but based on
[61:17] the understanding or background or age
[61:20] or whatever of the of the people in the
[61:22] market um they they choose different
[61:24] solutions and again to go back to the
[61:26] question about how long does this take
[61:29] that's why I think it takes a long time
[61:31] because people are also committed to
[61:33] their um solution we are not switching
[61:36] you and I are not switching anymore to
[61:37] any other solution we understand that
[61:39] any other option is inferior to to
[61:41] bitcoin so we are there we are there
[61:43] already but helping people switch from
[61:47] art or gold or real estate or you know
[61:49] whatever as a solution to their problem
[61:52] the the cash you know the money the
[61:54] currency debasing uh programmatically
[61:56] over
[61:57] time that is that is just the more
[61:59] important thing so we have to focus on
[62:02] that that's one so I think the that that
[62:04] part is way more important but also we
[62:06] will see that once people adopt it and
[62:09] you and I are an example of that they
[62:11] will help in the amplification of the
[62:16] message and the reasoning behind and the
[62:19] showing the proof and education behind
[62:21] why Bitcoin is a superior uh solution to
[62:24] the problem that that uh other people
[62:27] don't don't see yet so yeah I think I
[62:29] think that's my that's my answer there
[62:31] like it it doesn't matter if Bitcoin is
[62:33] the best solution it doesn't matter if
[62:35] nobody knows why it should exist then
[62:38] you know it'll it'll die eventually
[62:39] because no one adopts
[62:41] it that's why all those uh Forks of it
[62:44] don't exist because there are a lot of
[62:46] copies of Bitcoin that almost have the
[62:48] same code but they don't uh have the
[62:50] social uh Revolution behind their thing
[62:54] and that that that's uh that's what I
[62:56] lot I don't want to open that altcoin
[62:58] topic now no no no no this is good I
[63:01] wanted to go here that's why crypto is a
[63:03]  distraction please you know clip
[63:05] it or whatever crypto is a
[63:07] distraction yes everyone who's focused
[63:10] on crypto is focusing on the
[63:12] technological aspect guys okay I'm G to
[63:15] be faster I'm G to be this I'm G to be
[63:17] blah that doesn't matter this is
[63:19] immaculate conception Bitcoin is
[63:20] immaculate conception it works it is as
[63:23] as is you have to understand and accept
[63:26] that so if you only focus on making
[63:28] something technological better there are
[63:30] people in the world that think that that
[63:32] is important you know that's the blob of
[63:34] money going from one crypto project to
[63:38] the other that's also what pump. fun now
[63:41] killed that's funny think about this if
[63:44] you only chase the technological
[63:46] advancement and you think it's all about
[63:48] technology technology technology you're
[63:50] not asking the question should I build
[63:52] this people are asking the question can
[63:54] I build this oh yeah sure I can build
[63:56] this and I just put it into the world
[63:58] okay so let's make a website where you
[64:02] can just launch a token in a minute that
[64:05] sounds amazing guys let's do it and now
[64:08] you see 50,000 tokens A Day created on
[64:10] pump. fun and the entire crypto industry
[64:14] is
[64:15] dead does that make sense there's just
[64:17] like a blob of money that was like
[64:19] chasing a thousand projects and now
[64:22] they're chasing over a million project
[64:25] projects looking for the next big thing
[64:28] that's why crypto is a distraction you
[64:29] are focused on technology or you know
[64:33] some sort of Promise because you think
[64:36] that these are all companies trying to
[64:39] you know change the world or build a
[64:41] thing or or whatever but it's never
[64:43] happening I've been in Bitcoin for 10
[64:45] years I've been in crypto and following
[64:48] crypto from ethereum from like $70 or
[64:51] something
[64:53] okay there there are no useful
[64:56] crypto projects in the world there's one
[64:59] well that you have like sushi Swap and
[65:01] stuff like that like they have value
[65:03] because people use it to swap tokens
[65:05] that makes sense I think poly Market is
[65:08] a good example you know with freedom of
[65:11] of uh Capital combined with Freedom of
[65:13] Information eventually creates something
[65:16] that has value in the world but it's
[65:18] 2025 and they're trying for eight years
[65:20] like the the technological angle as to
[65:23] why you should go for crypto is nonsense
[65:26] because there's only one real use case
[65:28] for blockchain and that is a
[65:31] permissionless blockchain an open-
[65:33] Source protocol for everyone and the
[65:35] only use case for that is money and so I
[65:38] think it's a real pity that a lot of
[65:39] people that are into technology and and
[65:42] and forward looking and thinking they
[65:44] step into this trap of focusing on
[65:45] better technology where if you think
[65:48] about well a better
[65:51] money is is is a way more interesting
[65:56] end point and thing to focus on than
[66:00] building the next technological thing
[66:03] that's a that's a distraction does that
[66:05] make sense it it makes a lot of sense
[66:07] and and it is uh probably the biggest
[66:10] distraction for for bitcoiners these
[66:12] days um I have so many more questions
[66:15] but we are coming to the end of the time
[66:17] um I guess we have a lot of more
[66:19] material for a third round uh down the
[66:21] road somay um I have one question that I
[66:24] ask each and every one of my guests and
[66:26] the question is what can we learn from
[66:28] you besides
[66:29] Bitcoin oh I like
[66:32] that um I I said in the beginning you
[66:35] know that you can just do the things and
[66:37] that is something that I actually
[66:39] recently learned myself like the thought
[66:42] before that was also something that I
[66:44] shared in this conversation just like
[66:46] yeah the government is just other people
[66:47] or big corporations is just other people
[66:50] right like they they are other people
[66:52] like you and me and they have their own
[66:54] issues with
[66:56] their body or their mind or their family
[66:58] or their their their past or their
[67:00] future or their ego or whatever like
[67:02] every everyone has oh my mic is going
[67:05] down everyone has something I always say
[67:08] right and once you realize that everyone
[67:11] else is winging it too right everyone
[67:13] else is figuring it out as they go in
[67:16] their life it also means nobody knows
[67:18]  and you can just do the things so
[67:23] whatever you think you want to do
[67:25] whatever you you think you want to talk
[67:27] about online or or build or
[67:32] say you can just do it because it
[67:35] doesn't matter what other people think
[67:37] of you because they also have no clue
[67:39] there's no one literally no one that has
[67:41] really really really figured it out and
[67:44] when you realize that it'll actually
[67:46] have a freeing feeling and once you then
[67:50] start doing the thing you will realize
[67:53] that it's
[67:54] true and so so I think that's what
[67:56] people can learn from I love that so
[67:57] much I made that experience a lot in the
[67:59] the beginning of the podcast especially
[68:01] with sponsorships uh and and I had this
[68:05] I cannot remember I don't want to uh
[68:08] there was some really famous bitcoiner I
[68:10] I don't know exactly who it was H and we
[68:13] talked after podcast I was like all
[68:14] right it's it's like I try to figure
[68:17] that sponsorship and partnership thing
[68:18] out and I have no clue what to do and he
[68:21] said something I've been in the industry
[68:23] for 10 years I know also the Bitcoin
[68:26] companies have no clue what to do with
[68:27] the podcast they also know don't know
[68:30] what to pay for like it and stuff like
[68:31] that so it's very true of like uh we we
[68:35] all try to figure life out as we go I
[68:39] like that inside a lot really cool um we
[68:41] have an tin in the podcast where the
[68:43] previous guest is asking a question for
[68:45] the next guest without knowing who the
[68:46] next guest actually is okay uh and uh
[68:49] your question from the previous guest is
[68:51] how do you foresee Bitcoin scaling on a
[68:53] technical level I mean that would be a
[68:56] whole new podcast but maybe you have
[68:58] some some FS around that well it's
[68:59] interesting I would love to learn what
[69:01] that means because um as as I said I I
[69:05] think the The Urge that many people have
[69:09] with technology and thinking about what
[69:11] else can I build what is a cool thing to
[69:13] build is a very bad attitude and there
[69:17] are many people also on X that want to
[69:22] build cool stuff on bitcoin
[69:25] and I think that's conceptually nice but
[69:30] I am um following what what Michael
[69:33] sailor says a lot like I'm not a
[69:35] proponent of alific right like okay
[69:39] we're going to stop Bitcoin
[69:41] development but the the way Bitcoin
[69:45] works right now is really great I'm not
[69:48] going to say perfect it's really great
[69:51] and the fact that it's so narrow and the
[69:54] whole that so I see the goal of Bitcoin
[69:57] what is the what is the purpose of
[69:58] Bitcoin right what's the purpose of the
[70:00] Bitcoin protocol is to keep the truth
[70:04] that it
[70:05] guards to keep
[70:07] that
[70:09] um trustworthy right so the whole goal
[70:13] is of the network the miners right so
[70:17] the notes miners Etc is to uphold the
[70:21] Integrity of of the time
[70:23] chain right so so if the time chain
[70:26] right the truth the the the the
[70:29] fundamental truth layer of this monetary
[70:32] system if that is um maintained in the
[70:37] correct way as envisioned in the
[70:39] protocol right that is all what Bitcoin
[70:43] needs to do and and this is how Jeff
[70:46] boot says it right it has to stay
[70:48] decentralized and secure because these
[70:50] two things make sure that the Integrity
[70:52] of the time chain stays like it is and
[70:56] you see that all the people that focus
[70:58] on the technology part for example speed
[71:01] right these are all companies these are
[71:04] all groups these are all startups
[71:07] foundations whatever they already fill
[71:10] the Integrity part from the beginning
[71:13] because how can you trust a group of
[71:16] people does this make sense so the
[71:19] Integrity of the time chain of Bitcoin
[71:23] is constantly a assured by this
[71:27] decentralized network and that is the
[71:29] most important thing that Bitcoin needs
[71:31] to to to keep on
[71:34] doing and so I think we should not
[71:38] with that that's a very delicate thing
[71:39] that's what Michael sailor also says
[71:41] right it's like okay you built this
[71:42] rocket ship and then you're going to be
[71:43] like H maybe I'm going to add this or
[71:46] this to the rocket ship right but maybe
[71:47] then it blows up you don't you don't
[71:49] know so you have to he doesn't say you
[71:51] shouldn't do it but you should be very
[71:53] cautious this is very
[71:55] It's Not Fragile it's delicate right so
[71:58] it's not
[71:59] easily breakable but delicate you have
[72:01] to be really um how do you say that like
[72:05] you have to respect what it is right now
[72:08] and it's not just a cool thing to build
[72:10] more upon although on the other side I
[72:12] do think you know the whole concept of
[72:15] Bitcoin being the base layer of value we
[72:17] should build stuff but on top of Bitcoin
[72:20] so I think the most important thing
[72:23] technology wise for Bitcoin is to figure
[72:27] out where does the border of L1 and
[72:31] L2 where where is that because yes we
[72:34] should improve the the L1 the base layer
[72:37] and fix bugs and stuff like that but
[72:39] building the cool stuff on the base
[72:41] layer I think I'm not a big proponent of
[72:45] again I think it's a it's very delicate
[72:48] um so I think just focus more on on on
[72:51] L2 what what you know and next to
[72:54] lightning what are all the other things
[72:55] that we could build on an L2 that
[72:58] utilize this this truth
[73:01] Ledger and how does that connect to real
[73:05] use cases out in the world right what we
[73:08] talked about how does that connect to
[73:09] real problems that are there and for
[73:11] example I don't know if that's called is
[73:13] that called true vote I think there's a
[73:15] company that um does voting on on uh
[73:19] Bitcoin so
[73:21] um uh keeping the records of uh
[73:24] elections on on uh Bitcoin I think
[73:26] that's called TR vote.org I hope I don't
[73:28] butcher that but yeah that's kind of my
[73:30] thought on the technological part but
[73:31] it's interesting so for the person that
[73:33] asked the question think about where
[73:34] does this come from and for anyone
[73:36] listening to this like think about where
[73:37] does that come from why do you want to
[73:40] build more stuff that's never the the
[73:43] the true solution I'd say absolutely and
[73:47] it's like we we have to scale with uh
[73:49] layers otherwise we destroy the security
[73:51] in the decentralization of of Bitcoin
[73:53] that's a it's a very important point and
[73:56] also takes people a long time sometimes
[73:58] to figure that out I think so but I mean
[74:00] that's part of Bitcoin it's just the
[74:03] rabbit hole goes deep and why at the
[74:06] same time right absolutely uh really
[74:09] cool thank you so much PR uh for being
[74:10] on before I let you go where can people
