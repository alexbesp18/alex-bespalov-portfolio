[00:00] my first ever self-recorded video here
[00:03] on X with my real voice and face with no
[00:07] upack with no anything I'm really
[00:10] looking forward to that and the basic
[00:13] idea of that video format I'm starting
[00:15] right now is I review the top five
[00:18] tweets I'm seeing on X or Twitter as you
[00:21] want to uh name it um every week and
[00:25] this is the basic video idea and so
[00:28] let's get started number one is is a
[00:30] beauty I didn't saw it on X I saw it on
[00:34] the subreddit of Bitcoin and usually the
[00:39] Reddit posts are really high quality so
[00:43] I was like what is this girl doing here
[00:45] and I saw this and I was like is this is
[00:50] this a promotion is this an
[00:51] advertisement and I was like no it's an
[00:53] actual post un rdit and usually there's
[00:56] only high quality stuff on there and I
[00:58] was like okay let's scroll and then oh
[01:00]  I saw that there's an actual
[01:03] Bitcoin sign so I I really it took me a
[01:05] while and I'm looking at my screen here
[01:08] uh it took me a while to figure out the
[01:10] Bitcoin lining here and from that moment
[01:13] onwards uh there were more more pictures
[01:16] coming like the B and the study Bitcoin
[01:20] sign and a lot of different tweets
[01:22] coming out that basically look the same
[01:25] if if you're long enough in Bitcoin you
[01:27] will see Bitcoin everywhere like that B
[01:31] it's just if there's somewhere a b you
[01:34] you think about Bitcoin but maybe that's
[01:36] just me maybe maybe I'm the weird one
[01:39] here number two just in the amount of
[01:42] Bitcoin in addresses with
[01:45] 0.1 to one Bitcoin reaches an alltime
[01:49] high speak basically the Bitcoin that
[01:52] was were held in addresses that has the
[01:55] amount between 0.1 Bitcoin and exactly
[01:58] one Bitcoin those addresses the combined
[02:02] amount of Bitcoin reaches an amount of
[02:06] over 1 million Bitcoin this basically
[02:09] shows to us that Bitcoin gets more
[02:11] distributed about the lower end of
[02:14] Bitcoin so not only big accounts have
[02:16] them not only uh exchanges institutional
[02:19] investors Wales and uh and institutions
[02:23] like this have it also the uh retail
[02:27] investors also the normal
[02:30] people the blaps have those Bitcoins and
[02:33] the amount of blaps having Bitcoins is
[02:37] growing and growing and growing that's a
[02:39] really good sign number three and
[02:41] interesting one Peter dunworth says that
[02:44] Bitcoin will be worth $7
[02:47] billion per
[02:49] coin that's that's some number first off
[02:53] I thought he's talking about the market
[02:55] capitalization he has MAF to get there
[02:58] and his MAF checks out for me but you
[03:02] don't there's a lot of variables in
[03:05] there that uh and and the long way to go
[03:08] for that crazy number and also when
[03:11] Bitcoin reaches the area of over 1
[03:15] million over 10 million over 100 million
[03:19] I don't think we value the US dollar
[03:22] that much by then so uh at this point
[03:25] with 7 billion bcoin I don't know if
[03:28] anybody ever uses the US dollar anyways
[03:31] number four is a cute one there are some
[03:35] kids buying um burgers at McDonald's
[03:39] with Bitcoin I assume that's El Salvador
[03:43] that's cool I will not put my own tweet
[03:45] at number five I just saw this one the a
[03:48] bike that mines Bitcoin as you pedal on
[03:51] this is cool but I think it's more like
[03:53] gimmick I think there are more effective
[03:56] ways uh to gain Bitcoin than Biking For
[04:00] It biking till he gets his first
[04:04] Satoshi that's a great video thanks for
[04:07] watching and I'll see you in the next
[04:09] one
