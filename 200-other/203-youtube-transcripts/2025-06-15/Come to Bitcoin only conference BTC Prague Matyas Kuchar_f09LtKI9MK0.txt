[00:00] come to Prague meet European bitcoiners
[00:02] because we are different I failed it
[00:04] last year like when you go in there and
[00:06] you see all this other bitcoiners you
[00:08] talk with them there is a different why
[00:10] this energy inspires something in
[00:13] yourself we aim for 8,000 I think that
[00:17] we could manage to get 9,000 people
[00:20] there there was no shitcoin there was
[00:23] Bitcoin only the crowd was
[00:25] amazing why is it important for other
[00:28] bitcoiners that are listening here uh uh
[00:31] to meet other bitcoiners in person why
[00:33] should someone go to a yeah Bitcoin
[00:36] conference yeah good question it I think
[00:38] it's very important because you cannot
[00:42] get some things online and there are
[00:45] many reason to be more specific I would
[00:48] say that the the biggest reason why and
[00:50] and you have to you have to
[00:52] differentiate Bitcoin meetups and
[00:54] conferences yeah it's a scale every
[00:56] every meeting has a different reason but
[00:59] if I'm talking about conferences I would
[01:01] say that the biggest reason why to come
[01:03] is conviction um if you are a Bitcoin
[01:08] uie or you are not so well into Bitcoin
[01:12] um still you need to get um Through The
[01:16] Rabbit Hole uh this will speed up your
[01:19] process tremendously uh you come to the
[01:22] conference um you see so many people
[01:25] with a similar mindset um you see the
[01:29] companies in the Expo uh you can talk to
[01:32] the uh to the uh people from the
[01:34] companies to the employees and this will
[01:36] erase your conviction because it will
[01:38] show you that Bitcoin is a real thing
[01:41] and it's industry like every other and
[01:45] this this conviction of course will help
[01:47] you to be more calm uh while the
[01:51] volatility of Bitcoin price and and it
[01:54] will make um make much easier to stack
[01:57] sets and uh and get rid of rid of Fiat
[02:01] that would be the first reason I would
[02:03] say um for newbies and for people who
[02:07] need this conviction um the second is a
[02:10] feedback loop so if you come to um to
[02:14] the conference or Meetup you can ask
[02:17] people about something and and you can
[02:19] have a like really good discussion and
[02:21] you can ask many people and get many
[02:24] different ideas and then uh use your
[02:26] critical thinking and make up your own
[02:28] idea in the internet uh online it's not
[02:32] possible sometimes because there is so
[02:33] much noise and uh and uh and people are
[02:37] not so nice to each other and there are
[02:39] many trolls and with AI now you cannot
[02:43] trust um everything yeah so it's very
[02:47] difficult for um for a newb or or for
[02:52] pretty much everyone to say what is true
[02:55] and find some um Solid Ground um so
[03:00] that's a that's a second reason uh the
[03:02] feedback loop it's it's also like when
[03:05] you listen to talks of course you can
[03:08] listen it online from recording but if
[03:10] you listen it there and you are sitting
[03:14] um next to other bitcoiners you can feel
[03:16] the vibe that's very good but after the
[03:18] talk you can actually talk to the
[03:21] speaker they are usually very happy and
[03:24] and they are talking to to PLS or you
[03:27] can ask someone else next to yourself
[03:30] hey what was he talking about can you
[03:32] please explain me and this feedback loop
[03:34] this second step is very important part
[03:37] of the
[03:38] education um the another reason I would
[03:40] say is networking and that's for people
[03:42] who are more into Bitcoin already and
[03:45] they are uh looking for opportunities uh
[03:48] for business or just for fun make some
[03:51] more friends because sometimes we feel
[03:53] like we are the only bitcoiners in the
[03:55] world because we are sitting behind a
[03:57] computer but it's not true maybe there
[03:59] are there is a group of bitcoiners in
[04:01] our city and we just need to need to
[04:03] meet them and build the the trust the
[04:07] first connection um that that's again
[04:10] coming to the online word the the trust
[04:12] issue which we have because most of us
[04:15] use avatars on uh on the social media so
[04:19] it's very good to meet the person in um
[04:23] in the real word and then the uh the
[04:27] communication through the chat apps like
[04:30] telegram signal it's absolutely
[04:32] different because you know who is on the
[04:34] other side uh that's the that's the
[04:37] third reason networking um and and then
[04:40] um I would say that it's the the biggest
[04:44] reason and I I know that because I'm
[04:46] talking to to our customers and our
[04:48] attendees it's fun it's just incredibly
[04:52] um enjoyable uh event because you meet
[04:55] people who are very like yourself and
[04:58] you don't talk only about Bitcoin you
[05:00] talk about the other topics and
[05:03] bitcoiners tend to be very smart and
[05:05] very open very helpful to each other um
[05:09] and they they all like to have fun uh
[05:11] you don't see um grumpy faces uh you
[05:15] drink beer with others um there are many
[05:18] site events usually who who which are
[05:21] happening around the conference and um
[05:24] and because we are so early uh all the
[05:28] speakers are usually partying with PLS
[05:31] so uh this just gives you an opportunity
[05:34] to meet the people who you listen uh on
[05:38] the podcast or uh you read their books
[05:41] and uh yeah they're just flbs like us so
[05:45] um it's it's it's a fun to to meet them
[05:48] in in the real uh in the real world um
[05:52] so there would be like I would say the
[05:54] reasons there there are many of them and
[05:57] I'm personally surprised that there are
[05:58] no more people coming to the conferences
[06:01] and I'm I'm always thinking why is that
[06:04] yeah and um and trying to convince
[06:07] people to come to conference not only
[06:09] from my selfish reason because I I run
[06:11] the conference but because I really
[06:13] believe all these reasons are very valid
[06:15] and they will help Bitcoin grow because
[06:17] the ecosystem need more people need more
[06:20] um workers so to say yeah because um the
[06:24] opportunities are um are there and
[06:28] bitcoiners just need to need to grab it
[06:31] the the the companies are looking for
[06:34] more uh people like um uh for for higher
[06:39] um there are job opportunities and and
[06:41] this this makes me think like why is
[06:43] that that the people are not coming and
[06:45] maybe one of the reasons is upsc
[06:48] operational security they want to stay
[06:50] private maybe they are afraid that
[06:52] someone will uh steal their Bitcoins if
[06:54] they know they um real identity and
[06:58] that's valid fear yeah that's valid
[07:01] concern um so I I maybe address some
[07:05] points which we are doing for um
[07:07] mitigating this uh this concern the
[07:10] first one is that you can buy a ticket
[07:12] for BTC prag with Bitcoin with lightning
[07:15] that gives you quite a good privacy uh
[07:18] we don't collect any personal data no
[07:21] kyc we just need an email and you can do
[07:24] a onetime uh email address for for this
[07:27] purpose um and if you come to the uh to
[07:30] the event itself you can use mask masks
[07:33] are allowed and you can just blend into
[07:37] the crowd and I I would say that this is
[07:39] this is this is pretty uh pretty easy to
[07:42] do if you just follow just the basic um
[07:47] uh basic um steps to to prevent yourself
[07:51] from
[07:52] doxing yeah I mean it's it's I just want
[07:55] to add one more thing uh I was at a
[07:58] Bitcoin Pro last year and L it and I
[08:00] will go this year too uh by the way for
[08:03] everyone that wants to meet me wants to
[08:05] go do the event wants to like have cool
[08:09] U interactions with other speakers have
[08:12] have all those things that Maas just
[08:14] talked about uh there's a link down
[08:16] below where you can sign up and what I
[08:19] wanted to add to this list is the energy
[08:21] I fail it last year like when you go in
[08:24] there and you see all the other bit
[08:25] Corners you talk with them there is a
[08:28] different VIP that is something going on
[08:31] this energy uh inspires something in in
[08:34] yourself like I I listened uh before
[08:38] this event so much to Michael sailor
[08:40] already like I was sick of hearing from
[08:43] him because I listened already so much
[08:45] to him but at this conference uh uh it
[08:48] inspired me to do so much more and I
[08:50] just grew from my social media and
[08:52] everything so much since this event
[08:55] because it inspired me to do even more
[08:57] in Bitcoin you meet other people you can
[08:59] connect you can find job opportunities
[09:01] all the things you said so everybody
[09:04] that wants to be involved in Bitcoin
[09:06] should at least try one Bitcoin
[09:09] conference if if they don't like if they
[09:12] never was uh they they should try it
[09:15] once and I think everybody that already
[09:17] was uh they will buy it themselves
[09:20] anyways like they know what how amazing
[09:23] this feeling was and if they have time
[09:25] and if they have the the financial means
[09:27] to go to this conference uh uh they
[09:30] should definitely do it yeah um what I'm
[09:33] uh what what I'm also curious about is
[09:35] uh what was your like personal favorite
[09:37] moment of of the last Conference of of
[09:40] last
[09:42] year um yeah thank you for kind words
[09:44] and I'm happy to hear you that we helped
[09:46] you uh we inspired you and that you are
[09:49] another success story because we have so
[09:51] we have so many of these stories and it
[09:54] always pleas please my soul uh my
[09:57] personally favorite moment
[09:59] there were so many but I would say that
[10:03] uh I really enjoy Saturday because I I I
[10:06] could see that there is no more
[10:09] hiccups uh because it was our first uh
[10:12] International uh Edition so you can
[10:16] imagine running a six and a half
[10:18] thousand uh attendee conference it was a
[10:20] lot of work so Wednesday Thursday and
[10:24] Friday I was really busy I couldn't
[10:26] enjoy myself I was running around but
[10:29] Saturday uh after the morning um uh
[10:33] welcome talk I could I could really feel
[10:37] that that I I can like have a break and
[10:40] and just walking around seeing the faces
[10:43] and and and shaking more hands and
[10:46] actually have a coffee with someone so
[10:48] this like a nothing nothing specific
[10:51] just really enjoying enjoying the
[10:53] atmosphere and and and and seeing so
[10:56] many so many familiar faces and that
[10:58] everything is working amazing uh this is
[11:02] the the question I I have the next
[11:04] because it's it's special to get so many
[11:07] Bitcoin is in one place it's it's a task
[11:09] that's not easy uh and I also know that
[11:13] you
[11:14] have brag like a Czech language uh
[11:18] conference so my next question would be
[11:20] like how do you manage to get so many
[11:22] great speakers including Michael S and
[11:24] really the big ones uh and also so many
[11:28] attendees like uh the the speakers is
[11:30] one part the attendance is one part and
[11:32] the location everything like how do you
[11:34] manage to get all this together and
[11:37] where does this all
[11:39] stop okay um that's a very complex
[11:43] question um uh tldr is that we are
[11:48] working all we are doing only Bitcoin
[11:51] conferences we don't do anything else
[11:53] this is our main uh focus and uh and and
[11:56] main job we are team of now seven people
[12:00] who work uh only on these two
[12:03] conferences and uh it is a and and why
[12:07] we manag how we managed to get so many
[12:10] people there it's it was a snowballing
[12:12] effect we started in
[12:14] 2020 uh with our Czech speaking
[12:16] conference chain camp we had three very
[12:19] successful addition uh and in 2021 when
[12:23] we had 2,000 people there uh only in
[12:26] Czech and Slovak language yeah that's
[12:28] that's the that's the uh interesting
[12:31] part of this yeah only in Czech we
[12:33] managed to get 2,000 people there so it
[12:35] was probably the biggest non English
[12:38] speaking Bitcoin only conference in the
[12:40] world uh we actually decided that we
[12:43] will run one more conference and that's
[12:45] BTC prog and we will materialize all the
[12:48] opportunities we We Gather where we
[12:50] travel the world and we visiting other
[12:54] conferences and that's the part of of of
[12:57] why and how we are traveling a lot um
[13:00] last year we we visit um each of us I'm
[13:04] uh doing it with my brother martin so we
[13:07] kind of have the superpower to be
[13:09] everywhere we always split and so we can
[13:13] we manage to to be on many conferences
[13:15] we are talking to other people we are
[13:18] researching the community um staying up
[13:22] to dat with the with the trends and and
[13:25] making sure that that we just bring the
[13:27] best content um to people we are
[13:31] filtering the the noise um
[13:34] so and that's that's why it's so good
[13:37] because we are really we are putting so
[13:39] much effort to um to tune uh everything
[13:43] on all fronts and it's it's food it's
[13:46] it's the content it's speakers it's the
[13:48] vibe it's music there are thousands of
[13:51] small steps which needs to be um really
[13:55] um managed and uh and we we we love what
[13:59] we are doing so uh we spend a lot of
[14:02] time on it yeah the focus is is is great
[14:05] I got yesterday a comment on my my
[14:07] YouTube video Robin you're the hardest
[14:09] working Bitcoin podcaster on YouTube and
[14:12] I'm like yes and no because I'm only
[14:15] doing podcasting like I of course do my
[14:17] Twitter and other stuff I'm working with
[14:18] companies but if you have one focus and
[14:21] you couldn't do only one thing uh then
[14:23] is a lot of things are possible and I
[14:26] love doing it and one more part that
[14:28] just uh we did not mention till now and
[14:31] this podcast is also Bitcoin only and I
[14:34] enjoyed the conference so much because
[14:36] there was no shitcoin that was there was
[14:39] Bitcoin only this the crowd was amazing
[14:41] I never was at such a big uh conference
[14:44] where there was just there was just
[14:46] bitcoiners I I did not meet uh like a
[14:49] lot of altcoin maybe it was just my
[14:50] bubble like maybe I don't know but I
[14:53] didn't I only meet Bitcoin only guys
[14:57] yeah because we are uh we are very very
[15:00] conservative um as a Founders and and
[15:04] creators o of the of the content we are
[15:07] very conservative so we don't give space
[15:09] uh to even slight uh slightly uh like
[15:13] built on bitcoin and I can name
[15:16] it like okay you start with on the very
[15:19] very far uh like a blockchain web tree
[15:23] then it goes through some uh like bad l
[15:29] which have some tokens and then you go
[15:31] through ordinals and inscriptions and
[15:34] and you can stop in some some part but
[15:37] we are on the very conservative part and
[15:40] that means that um we attract only the
[15:43] hardcore part of the Bitcoin ecosystem H
[15:47] and maybe maybe it's uh someone can
[15:51] argue that it's not good um good
[15:55] approach and I'm always saying that it
[15:58] that's that's how that's what we are we
[16:00] are doing conferences how we like it um
[16:04] and uh we are doing conferences for
[16:06] people who are on the similar path as as
[16:10] us as a as a monetary
[16:12] maximalists amazing and I'm also BR that
[16:16] uh I'm living so close to this amazing
[16:19] Bitcoin conference because I was at uh
[16:21] already some and I can definitely say
[16:24] this is this is one of my favorite
[16:27] Bitcoin conference at this scale this is
[16:29] is like uh Bitcoin only the crowd is
[16:31] amazing and yeah I also like check in
[16:34] general but people might might not like
[16:36] check I don't know but I like check a
[16:38] lot and as as a bitcoiner you will enjoy
[16:41] this this this Bitcoin conference yeah a
[16:44] lot um what inspired you actually uh to
[16:47] to get started we touched on the story a
[16:50] little bit before but before we get on
[16:53] the store like what what was the the
[16:55] starting point why Bitcoin and why then
[16:57] starting a conference in it mhm um I
[17:01] would say that that is very classic
[17:03] story um I got into um because of the um
[17:09] uh of the money and then stay for
[17:12] technology uh I went through the classic
[17:14] uh coining phase I lost most of my
[17:17] Bitcoin during the uh 2017 until 2019
[17:23] bull bull bear Market lot of trading a
[17:25] lot of bad decisions and uh that that
[17:29] kind of taught me the hard lesson that
[17:32] Bitcoin owner is the
[17:33] way and what was the what was the moment
[17:37] we decided to uh actually throw the
[17:39] first conference it was because we saw
[17:41] that there are no conferences in Czech
[17:43] Republic um there were just meetups in
[17:46] progue only in
[17:48] parolis and uh and some small
[17:50] conferences as well like uh like um um
[17:54] um hccp the hacker Congress very very
[17:57] very good conference um but nothing in
[18:01] the in the bigger scale and for newbies
[18:03] so we decided that we will organize this
[18:05] like um uh Bitcoin um and at this time
[18:09] it was still mixed with just like a
[18:11] slight slight crypto it was like a defi
[18:15] kind of style like maybe a bit of
[18:17] ethereum in in the 2020 I must say and
[18:22] um um and yeah because I I I used to
[18:27] live abroad and I visit some conferences
[18:31] um and I saw that how good is it and how
[18:34] um how I love it yeah like meeting other
[18:37] people and and talking about uh uh
[18:40] Bitcoin is is always very very pleasant
[18:43] so yeah we just used the opportunity and
[18:46] because it was in 2020 in the covid time
[18:50] uh the restrictions were very very
[18:53] strong and we we managed to throw this
[18:56] event during September 20 20 when you
[19:00] couldn't plan anything it was impossible
[19:02] like the restrictions where one day was
[19:04] uh was okay to go out and the second day
[19:07] if you didn't have a dog you couldn't go
[19:10] even outside from your house you know it
[19:12] was very strict but there was a small
[19:14] window of like I don't know like two
[19:16] weeks when the restrictions went
[19:19] actually down and the maximum uh um
[19:23] maximum number of people were
[19:25] 500 so we we said to our yourself yeah
[19:29] let's do it and um and that that was
[19:33] that was the beginning yeah it was a big
[19:35] success and the next years um we always
[19:38] doubled so the 22 was 1,000 people and
[19:42] uh 20 uh sorry 21 was 1,000 people and
[19:46] 2022 we had two more than 2,000 people
[19:50] there in in the Czech and Slovak
[19:52] language how many people do you expect
[19:55] at the Bitcoin prag this year well
[19:59] um we aim for 8,000 I think that we
[20:04] could manage to get 9,000 people there
[20:08] in a total but we want to keep everyone
[20:13] um convenient so we don't aim to have
[20:17] like full house that's not what we want
[20:20] to achieve so we are still counting the
[20:23] numbers and making sure that we have
[20:25] enough sitting outside and inside for
[20:28] everyone and at this moment it it seems
[20:30] that 8,000 is the um is the ideal number
[20:35] where oh we know that we every everyone
[20:38] will be will be happy and there will be
[20:40] no big lines on the food and and not a
[20:43] huge crowd and not too too hot in in the
[20:46] conference Hall and the air condition
[20:48] will will handle it so there are many
[20:50] things what we what we need to put into
[20:53] this factors yeah amazing it felt like
[20:56] that last year there was always space I
[20:58] I mean uh The Only Exception maybe was
[21:00] Michael sailor speech where I think
[21:02] everybody was in there I I was half an
[21:04] hour early there and said like in the
[21:06] fifth throw or something like that that
[21:07] was an amazing feeling uh by the way and
[21:11] maybe let's get into check because I
[21:13] have a lot of American uh V uh viewers a
[21:16] lot of viewers outside of Europe even
[21:19] like I think my top countries are like
[21:21] America Canada Australia uh for them
[21:25] it's like they probably never been to
[21:27] check they probably maybe they've never
[21:29] been to Europe and they might take this
[21:32] Bitcoin conference as a reason also to
[21:34] visit prag to visit Europe to visit
[21:37] Czech um why why should people visit
[21:40] Czech Republic what's a little bit the
[21:42] the story between uh of of check and is
[21:45] it is that connection to to to Freedom
[21:49] yeah yeah there is a huge uh connection
[21:51] to Freedom um Czech CS have uh and I
[21:55] don't want to this to sound as as a
[21:57] history lesson um so uh I I will just
[22:02] say that like in a very um very long
[22:05] history checks have always been um under
[22:09] some oppressive regime because we are a
[22:11] very small country and we always had to
[22:13] fight the fight for our freedom we
[22:16] always won the fight but we again we
[22:20] lost the the freedom uh because someone
[22:23] else um um had had a stronger stronger
[22:27] uh hand or or Army so uh but but the
[22:31] very very early history is like that
[22:35] checks has been uh uh had been under the
[22:37] Russian communism regime um and and this
[22:41] made uh
[22:44] people
[22:45] quite
[22:47] um like against the authority like not
[22:50] respecting The Authority doing their own
[22:54] things and like don't give a you
[22:57] know if I if I use this word and also it
[23:00] created the the the Craftsman culture
[23:03] because um as you might know that um and
[23:06] your listeners that uh the communism is
[23:09] a centrally planned U economy and that
[23:13] means that that nothing is on the market
[23:15] yeah the market is very limited and uh
[23:19] if you if you wanted to have something
[23:21] something nice something different than
[23:23] than others you had to make it yourself
[23:27] okay there was there was a one car on
[23:29] the market and uh you had to wait a long
[23:31] time there was a two pieces of um of
[23:34] furniture for the living room yeah if
[23:37] you wanted to have some something else
[23:39] or in different different color you had
[23:41] to make it yourself and these little
[23:44] things um together with the communism
[23:47] regime uh created this kind of
[23:51] counterculture and parallel structures
[23:54] in the society where people knew that
[23:57] they need to
[23:59] um they need to take care about themsel
[24:01] if they want to live better life um and
[24:04] so it was a Craftsman culture but also
[24:07] education uh they knew that the the uh
[24:10] in the school they are washing their
[24:12] hands brainwashing their their hats so
[24:15] they created like afternoon
[24:17] schools uh where they were teaching
[24:19] about about Freedom um and this this
[24:23] this whole thing create quite natural
[24:26] ground for for bitcoiners so when
[24:29] Bitcoin appeared in 2009 um there were
[24:33] few people um who are into this in in in
[24:37] this space until now and they were
[24:39] meeting in the hacker space in Prague in
[24:42] burlap and um these people are uh pav
[24:47] Stig rusnak um M palatinus um uh known
[24:51] as as a slash um Carl Kowski and Yan
[24:56] chapek and pav morav people from bra and
[24:59] general bites and they were geeking
[25:01] about Bitcoin and solving their own
[25:02] problems with um what they didn't like
[25:05] about Bitcoin so the first ever um uh
[25:10] mining pool slash pool was invented in
[25:13] Prague in
[25:14] 20110 um then the first ever Hardware
[25:17] wallet treasure was invented in Prague
[25:20] in 2012 I think then um the brains uh
[25:25] take took over the the Slash pool they
[25:29] came up with the First open- Source
[25:31] firmware also in Prague and general
[25:34] bites the biggest at Bitcoin ATM
[25:36] manufacturer was uh invented in Prague
[25:39] by Carol Kowski and his team so this
[25:43] gave a very good ground to the Bitcoin
[25:45] uh Community um so with the with the
[25:49] time the Bitcoin Community grew uh there
[25:52] was also and still is until now paral
[25:55] neolis in Prague that's a three floor uh
[25:59] building painted on black uh welcoming
[26:02] hackers and crypto anarchists and uh um
[26:07] and and uh people who actually uh like
[26:10] this this part of the movement and it's
[26:14] working without Fiat uh since 2014 yeah
[26:18] they are not accepting Fiat it's
[26:20] probably the only place in in C Republic
[26:24] maybe I'm I'm wrong maybe there is one
[26:26] more or few more but
[26:28] um uh this this this whole whole thing
[26:31] it's um it gave the good ground for for
[26:35] the people to actually learn about
[26:37] Bitcoin in the right EOS um I would say
[26:41] that we don't have much of the
[26:43] coining anymore um the Bitcoin hardcore
[26:47] Community is Big we we have Bitcoin
[26:49] meetups in 30 cities all over C Republic
[26:53] and since last year there is an
[26:55] application uh called quco which giv
[26:58] give you an option to pay with Bitcoin
[27:01] and lightning in more than 1,000 pups
[27:04] all over chck
[27:06] Republic for food and drinks really cool
[27:11] really cool yeah I like also the Bitcoin
[27:13] scene in in in in in brag and in Czech
[27:16] uh there's like treasure I have soon
[27:19] podcast with vexel also they all go
[27:22] going to the Satoshi Labs so I think the
[27:25] Bitcoin scene in in in in prag and check
[27:28] is is yeah is amazing what do you see
[27:31] like when when we have like this Bitcoin
[27:34] Citadel in in Bitcoin prag uh where so
[27:37] many people come and you feel the the
[27:39] fire you feel the the world uh in in a
[27:41] different sphere then you go back to
[27:43] normal land it's a little different uh
[27:46] what do you imagine a world looking like
[27:48] if they only Bitcoin or or like at least
[27:51] Bitcoin is kind of a full adoption
[27:54] standard uh what do you see as like a
[27:57] changes in in the world for for
[28:00] that well this is very far away uh from
[28:04] now
[28:05] um um I I I don't even have like
[28:09] educated guess uh how long it will take
[28:12] until the HPP bit conization will come
[28:15] we still need to solve some scaling
[28:17] problems which are now um I would say
[28:20] very trendy topic no one really knows uh
[28:23] how to solve it so there is a big uh big
[28:26] problem in front of us
[28:28] and I'm pretty sure that we will solve
[28:30] it um and that um it will change a lot
[28:35] yeah
[28:36] um
[28:38] Bitcoin yeah the the thing is Bitcoin
[28:41] fix
[28:42] everything um and like if if you take it
[28:46] like very from the very abstract way I
[28:48] would say that it it's almost true but
[28:53] um not to speak in the in the absolute
[28:57] uh terms
[28:58] um I feel I feel that from the social uh
[29:02] aspect uh Bitcoin really change the the
[29:06] time preference of people and and give
[29:09] them the ability to save and plan uh
[29:13] more long term and that's very healthy
[29:17] that's very healthy it also gives people
[29:20] hope um and and ability to fight against
[29:25] inflation they they don't need to get
[29:27] the whole thing
[29:28] the whole complex Bitcoin Theory um
[29:32] monetary philosophy technical part um
[29:35] each each of us will take only what what
[29:38] they need for their life and and that's
[29:40] enough
[29:42] so in the future I think it's very
[29:45] bright and we will be looking uh back
[29:49] and and and reading and our kids will be
[29:52] reading the history pre Bitcoin and and
[29:54] just shaking their heads like how stupid
[29:58] the people were using some strength Bank
[30:01] uh um currencies and and and listening
[30:05] listening the governments I really
[30:07] believe in the sovereign individual
[30:09] tesis and that's also for not everyone
[30:13] um so uh I believe that it it will just
[30:17] uh um yeah everyone needs to find his
[30:20] own way in the future and and um and
[30:24] Bitcoin will bring the
[30:26] responsibility U for individuals yeah I
[30:29] believe in absolute responsibility um
[30:32] governments yeah they they they took
[30:34] care about us same as uh as a church
[30:38] before but now uh same as we separated
[30:42] um state from the church uh we need to
[30:45] separate money from the state and it's
[30:48] just another uh level of um Evolution
[30:51] for for a civilization 21 Bitcoin is
[30:54] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[30:57] and preach self custody this is my goto
[31:00] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[31:03] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[31:05] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[31:08] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[31:11] support this podcast use code Robin and
[31:14] click the link in the description and
[31:16] it's it's always interesting for me to
[31:18] experience with this thought how uh
[31:21] politics and states and governments look
[31:24] like if they don't have the possibility
[31:26] to print anymore and the actually have
[31:28] to tax people uh and then people are
[31:31] like hm I I don't know if I want to
[31:34] support that with my taxes because
[31:36] people are really Furious about taxes
[31:38] but they're not as Furious about money
[31:40] printing because they don't feel it
[31:42] immediately and you can even like for
[31:44] example in Swiss I don't know how it is
[31:46] in in check in Swiss you actually have
[31:47] to pay your taxes yourself like it's not
[31:50] like most people in Austria they get the
[31:52] paycheck and they get the money in the
[31:55] bank and uh it's already have been taken
[31:57] care of of the of the employer so they
[32:02] don't notice the taxes but in swis
[32:05] people actually have to pay themselves
[32:07] and that's why they have a way better
[32:08] connection with with the government and
[32:10] the the taxes because they actually have
[32:11] to pay and they have way more on on
[32:14] direct democracy and stuff like that how
[32:16] do you see like is do you see any Vision
[32:20] you mentioned the Bitcoin the sovereign
[32:23] individual when when the from a
[32:25] political uh sphere when we have have
[32:28] not the ability to print anymore I mean
[32:30] this is could be long I mean maybe
[32:33] governments always print something and
[32:36] and Bitcoin is always like just a
[32:38] another option to the government money I
[32:40] don't know how the future will look like
[32:42] I have certainly a lot of different
[32:44] opinions already on my podcast um how do
[32:47] you see that uh is Bitcoin uh forcing
[32:50] governments to be more frugal also with
[32:53] money and more efficient in in in
[32:55] government spending uh or maybe even go
[32:57] going to like a government as a service
[33:00] where you can choose your government I
[33:03] had the offer of the Bitcoin Nations
[33:05] book on and he said like you can freely
[33:08] choose which government services you you
[33:11] you take in the future and you can
[33:12] choose like oh I want this government
[33:14] service or I don't like it it's like
[33:16] like a really free model uh where the
[33:19] borders are not
[33:21] as as important anymore as it's
[33:25] now well yeah that's a difficult
[33:28] question uh I don't
[33:30] know I wish I I would still be alive uh
[33:35] when when this thesis will be playing
[33:38] out and and many people will be living
[33:40] in in the like choose your government uh
[33:44] word um because it's already happening
[33:47] now yeah you can you can pretty much do
[33:50] this um um uh flag Theory they they call
[33:55] it like okay you have a one passport in
[33:57] Paraguay you have one passport or um in
[34:01] in Dubai and and then another one
[34:03] somewhere and you have your company
[34:05] there you have your uh family there and
[34:08] and you're using this like a um
[34:12] opportunity um of of others um of other
[34:18] nations and you craft it to your to your
[34:21] special needs so it's already here it's
[34:23] just that most of the people uh don't
[34:26] use it and and it's quite costly so I
[34:31] believe that it's going to be better and
[34:33] better and and more and more people will
[34:37] be using this because it's as you said
[34:40] like people don't like to pay uh pay
[34:43] taxes and the inflation is just another
[34:45] tax which is invisible and people will
[34:48] be leaving the the people who who are
[34:51] rich who who make the money and who
[34:53] value their their freedoms they will
[34:56] they will leave the countries where
[34:58] where are these draconians regimes
[35:00] because they they just don't feel like
[35:03] um living in a social socialism uh Lefty
[35:07] regime where you have to work hard to to
[35:12] support someone who is lazy yeah this
[35:14] doesn't make sense yeah it's
[35:17] just um I don't know like it doesn't
[35:20] make sense for me at least like I'm
[35:23] working my ass off and and I want to
[35:25] want to choose who I support uh not that
[35:28] someone will do it for me yeah that's uh
[35:31] that's amazing the last last thing I
[35:33] want to ask you about the regulatory did
[35:35] you had any Encounters in check with
[35:38] with having such a big Bitcoin
[35:40] conference uh or do you because I feel
[35:44] often like in you in the in Europe in
[35:46] European Union they they try to limit
[35:49] stuff they trying to put pressure on on
[35:52] bitcoin um I mean we we have swiss we
[35:55] have other nations where there's a lot
[35:57] of things involving and innovating uh
[36:01] but did you had any encounter with
[36:03] regulatory stuff that you like that's
[36:06] it's not good but or is check a little
[36:08] bit more free in in that because there's
[36:11] going on anyways um yeah again I'm not
[36:15] the best person to talk about it because
[36:17] I don't follow politics at all
[36:19] I'm I don't like it so I'm trying to
[36:22] stay away but of course I need need to
[36:25] uh need to know what is happening um so
[36:28] I can give you some uh broad perspective
[36:31] what is happening in check it always has
[36:33] been like the check
[36:36] um was very um let's say um
[36:43] tolerating uh to crypto and Bitcoin
[36:48] holders so um of course you can pay you
[36:52] have to pay uh income tax um some of the
[36:56] problems I would say the worst is for
[36:58] the companies that the banks don't want
[37:00] to open the bank accounts so uh there is
[37:04] a there is a Lobby initiative in check
[37:08] uh who are trying to make this better
[37:12] that they they would put a a
[37:14] law that every company has a has a right
[37:18] for a bank account it seems like it it's
[37:22] going to uh be approved soon and
[37:26] together with this with this this
[37:28] Bitcoin crypto Lobby uh they want to
[37:31] approve
[37:32] um uh a law of the time test similar
[37:37] like in Germany like if you hold um
[37:40] Bitcoin for three years or two years I'm
[37:43] not sure two or three years you won't be
[37:46] a you won't need to pay uh the income
[37:48] tax uh from uh from
[37:52] this um and there are few more uh few
[37:55] more I would say uh proposals for for
[37:59] the for the government um for the
[38:03] parliament which are in the process um
[38:06] and it seems like that the the the
[38:09] politicians are listening and they are
[38:12] very open also the central bank is quite
[38:16] open and friendly I would say um and if
[38:21] you ask why I would say that it might be
[38:24] because we have a quite deep roots in
[38:26] Austrian EC economics um so
[38:30] um even the even the central Bankers
[38:33] know about Austrian school and that
[38:36] means that they um they recognize the
[38:40] the opportunity and and don't don't feel
[38:44] um like they need to fight Bitcoin yeah
[38:47] it's more like that they are looking for
[38:50] the right way how to merge these two
[38:52] systems at least that that's my
[38:55] impression amazing yeah I also think the
[38:57] game fa will play out and I'm I'm like
[39:00] you actually I don't follow politics I
[39:02] have uh one two friends that are
[39:05] actually politicians in my local town
[39:07] and uh in Austria uh this is where I
[39:10] like and they all bitcoiners like I I
[39:13] only be friends with politicians that
[39:15] kind of Bitcoin friendly or like want
[39:17] want to be Bitcoin and that's I always
[39:20] enjoy them talking and I always ask like
[39:23] oh what what can we do to embrace
[39:25] Bitcoin more on a political scale
[39:27] because I see so much happening in Swiss
[39:30] I don't see anything happening in
[39:31] Austria
[39:32] unfortunately in in in Germany as you
[39:35] mentioned I think it's one year even
[39:37] when you hold Bitcoin more than one year
[39:39] you get it uh you can sell it taxfree in
[39:43] Austria the same was true but now they
[39:46] deleted that so you have to pay 27%
[39:50] taxes I think when uh I don't know about
[39:53] it because I never sell I just I just
[39:55] buy uh so I don't even what the tax on
[39:58] that is I hope I have I never have to to
[40:01] experience the tax on my Bitcoin I will
[40:04] try to avoid it at some
[40:06] somehow um maybe do do let's get closer
[40:09] to the end uh before we get to the real
[40:12] end routine um what do you think what do
[40:15] you what's your what will be your
[40:17] highlight of this year's conference what
[40:19] do you see like as as the the the moment
[40:22] you're looking forward uh to to the to
[40:24] the
[40:25] conference um
[40:28] well the the Highlight would be uh would
[40:31] be probably the theme of the
[40:34] conference um which we are trying to uh
[40:38] and and we we talking I'm talking to
[40:40] every single speaker on the conference
[40:43] and I'm pitching my idea of level up
[40:46] because I believe that uh many
[40:49] bitcoiners are actually ready to level
[40:52] up and that means for someone um just
[40:58] yeah to do do a little bit more to
[41:00] upgrade your stuff yeah and so for
[41:04] someone it can be stop buying Bitcoin on
[41:06] Exchange buy Bitcoin no kyc yeah that's
[41:09] a very important step for leveling up
[41:12] for being better with the with with the
[41:15] technology for someone it can be start
[41:18] using Hardware wallet for someone who
[41:20] has a hardware wallet start using um or
[41:23] Securo Bitcoin with multis or Shamir
[41:27] sharing or run a note that's super
[41:30] important um so we will be encouraging
[41:33] people to use the technology and we will
[41:35] be
[41:36] empowering everyone there with exactly
[41:40] what what they need yeah so for everyone
[41:43] there will be something what they will
[41:45] learn and every speaker is let's say
[41:49] instructed uh to give some action call
[41:53] um how to use it so the talks are not
[41:56] only interest but they are actionable
[41:58] and that's very important because people
[42:01] like to learn new things but um but uh
[42:06] there needs to be some some steps to
[42:09] make and so we are we are tailoring the
[42:12] program this way that the people should
[42:15] be able to after the talk to really um
[42:18] take it and use it for their own good
[42:22] will it be similar than last year with
[42:24] the three different stages with the main
[42:26] stage check stage and um uh the stage in
[42:30] the in the hall in the how is it called
[42:33] poof Hall yeah expool expool so yes we
[42:37] will have four stages same as last year
[42:40] so it's a main stage it's a check stage
[42:43] which will be bigger this year we will
[42:45] move it more more more further in the
[42:48] venue um and Expo stage and the third
[42:52] one is a VIP stage which is in the VIP
[42:55] area and that's not record it uh because
[42:59] we uh we like to it's only for um the
[43:03] best
[43:04] speakers and uh because it's not
[43:08] recorded uh we expect that the speakers
[43:10] will share something more
[43:13] juicy what would they might be afraid to
[43:18] share in front of so many people and on
[43:21] the
[43:21] camera yeah and I think it's it's uh a
[43:25] good thing to do actually uh because
[43:27] when you have a threshold to stuff uh
[43:30] you can also filter kind of but I was I
[43:35] was not at the stage last year I might
[43:37] consider this year and I I love that
[43:40] yeah Bitcoin conferences uh bring so
[43:43] many values and I love the concept of
[43:45] level up actually that you're doing
[43:47] every every um uh talk every stage
[43:51] you're doing with the theme of leveling
[43:54] up because uh when we see Bitcoin as we
[43:57] all so early to it it's like we are in
[43:59] the internet stage of
[44:01] 1995 uh and we can
[44:04] really bring something valuable to the
[44:07] globe we can bring something amazing uh
[44:10] to to the world with Bitcoin and
[44:12] everybody that can be now in this will
[44:16] benefit from it greatly I think and so
[44:19] on a personal level but also on a
[44:21] greater scale level uh it's amazing to
[44:23] to level up in the Bitcoin community and
[44:25] yeah I like the theme uh about it uh
[44:28] last question before the end routine is
[44:30] there anything beyond the Bitcoin
[44:33] conference uh for your company and
[44:36] Bitcoin prag uh that you you want to do
[44:39] is there anything of a like a vision of
[44:42] of what you want to do in the coming
[44:44] years uh is it like maybe more more
[44:47] conferences in other areas of Europe or
[44:50] maybe even America what what do you see
[44:52] as a like the next like five years do
[44:54] you have any anything planned that you
[44:56] can share
[44:57] yeah uh no I must disappoint you this uh
[45:02] we we are not planning anything the
[45:04] Bitcoin ecosystem is evolving so fast
[45:07] that you cannot plan too much up front
[45:10] we are always planning uh one year and
[45:14] maybe maybe the second year maybe two
[45:17] years into the future so for next year
[45:20] we know that we want to scale up for
[45:23] 2025 because we expect there will be a
[45:25] bull market and H huge demand so we will
[45:29] be probably scaling up and probably then
[45:31] we will scale down so that that's
[45:34] probably our plan for 2025 and
[45:37] 2026 but we don't have uh Ambitions to
[45:42] grow um over prog because it's a lot of
[45:46] work and I cannot imagine um like
[45:50] organizing more conferences because then
[45:52] you lose touch with it and I really want
[45:55] um want to have have the pilot seat and
[45:58] want to want to have the control over
[46:01] over the program and and I really cannot
[46:05] like imagine organizing organizing more
[46:08] than two conferences per year I I can
[46:11] imagine two has already a lot the one uh
[46:14] International in brag and the one with
[46:17] the the czecho language uh so perfect
[46:19] and uh we come to our endro team where
[46:21] the previous guest is asking uh a
[46:24] question for for the next guest and the
[46:26] question for for you is what event or
[46:28] thought or video or whatever in your
[46:31] life was the turning point for you where
[46:33] you said um Bitcoin it is I'm going all
[46:37] in Bitcoin I'm doing Bitcoin conference
[46:38] I'm doing that like is there some video
[46:41] thought some event that happened that
[46:44] you're like I'm now going all in Bitcoin
[46:47] or I'm going to
[46:48] bitcoin um for me it was probably a
[46:52] combination of books uh I would say it
[46:55] was a Bitcoin standard and um a book
[47:00] from uh muray
[47:02] rotbart I forgot the title uh but uh I
[47:08] would say it was a combination of like
[47:10] hard money that I got this hard money
[47:13] standard and I connected with with the
[47:16] uh with the upcoming inflation because I
[47:19] I I could see that how how governments
[47:21] are Printing and I could see the
[47:24] inflation coming already in 200 18 n 17
[47:28] 18 before the real inflation hit the
[47:31] number hit it so
[47:34] um it wasn't probably video but yes okay
[47:38] uh if I if I have to choose a video it
[47:40] was definitely Andreas
[47:43] antonopulos uh this this is my Bitcoin
[47:46] Daddy yeah he he has been orange billing
