[00:00] I woke up to snow in North Carolina Ross
[00:02] is free totally iconic I was reading
[00:04] wired man like Ross was on the cover
[00:06] Silk Road it was just so cool all the
[00:08] tech were building that Medium of
[00:10] exchange letting people save their money
[00:12] in Bitcoin this guy was just pioneering
[00:15] so early that's totally touching I hate
[00:16] shitcoins uh it's Bitcoin lightning or
[00:19] Bust the internet was built to invent
[00:21] Bitcoin everything else is a mistake we
[00:23] need pure-t pure digital cash that kind
[00:25] of is the point you can hand something
[00:27] to anybody else anywhere that's the
[00:29] whole product Market fit that's the
[00:31] whole value out of Bitcoin if I have a
[00:33] stock and bond in real estate portfolio
[00:35] like good luck zapping that to Tokyo
[00:37] can't do it with Bitcoin the whole point
[00:39] is it's liquid 24/7 there is no after
[00:41] hours trading that you need to sell your
[00:43] stocks on or during hours trading
[00:45] there's no bank holid is this 24/7 Tick
[00:47] Tock next block a got put in prison for
[00:49] the Silk Road but did we lose I mean I
[00:51] wish he didn't go obviously but like we
[00:53] didn't go anywhere coin still won like
[00:56] it's it's like a Hydra with unlimited
[00:57] heads how are you going to kill it
[01:01] [Music]
[01:03] Ross got got finally
[01:05] freed yeah man it doesn't even feel
[01:08] right to speak without touching on this
[01:10] first uh Ross is free after years and
[01:13] years um completely iconic great uh
[01:17] great things to come I think and uh it's
[01:20] it's it's such a big Topic in uh in the
[01:23] bitco and seen Ross because whenever we
[01:28] mention Ross on the podcast uh the
[01:30] comments were filled with it like it's
[01:32] always like if if you mentioned that
[01:34] that's where usually the focus on on the
[01:36] podcast also was going and uh for
[01:39] bitcoiners it was a really emotional
[01:41] topic and interestingly enough that's
[01:44] for bitcoiners more important than
[01:47] president Trump saying like oh we do a
[01:49] strategic Bitcoin Reserve or something
[01:50] like that which is amazing to see uh
[01:54] because obviously a strategic Bitcoin
[01:56] Reserve would be better for Bitcoin um
[01:59] uh bitcoin's price than Russ but Bitcoin
[02:03] is still like really focused on on Ross
[02:05] I think that's a really um really nice
[02:07] thing about it yeah yeah it is you know
[02:11] I really think bitcoiners are built
[02:12] different I think a lot of people think
[02:14] that and uh you know there's kind of
[02:17] like no man Left
[02:19] Behind like you're seeing that right now
[02:22] and uh man I remember being in English
[02:25] class back in American High School in
[02:28] Upstate New York and my teacher was
[02:30] asking oh you got to read this book read
[02:32] this book no I was reading wired man
[02:34] like Ross was on the cover Silk Road it
[02:37] was just so cool and all the tech we're
[02:39] building now medium of exchange letting
[02:42] people save their money in Bitcoin it's
[02:45] like this guy was just pioneering so
[02:47] early and I've never met Ross but uh
[02:50] yeah it's totally touching it's insane
[02:51] to see bitcoiners come together and you
[02:54] know I think at some level like you do
[02:55] have to write the wrongs of the past a
[02:57] little bit right like this guy is
[02:58] sitting in prison
[03:00] uh we're paying for it through inflation
[03:02] and tax first of all I don't want to be
[03:04] paying for people to be rotting second
[03:07] he shouldn't be rotting in the first
[03:08] place so uh yeah gonna be celebrating
[03:12] for sure um maybe for the people that uh
[03:16] I mean I don't know how many or if
[03:18] there's even someone that doesn't know
[03:20] about Russ albri um can you quickly just
[03:24] uh summarize because it's the day of him
[03:27] like how how you see the story and and
[03:29] what happened kind of like obviously
[03:31] there's a lot to to cover we could
[03:32] probably talk the whole podcast but like
[03:35] maybe in your short short words yeah
[03:38] yeah for sure so um look I mean Ross had
[03:41] a massive impact on bitcoin
[03:42] bootstrapping from a kind of a nent
[03:44] cipher Punk mailing list but really uh
[03:48] Bitcoin kind of came out we looked at
[03:50] proof of Reserve um and as far as I know
[03:54] one of the very first applications for
[03:56] people to actually do Commerce online
[03:59] with something a kind do maybe a
[04:01] Craigslist or an eBay kind of like an
[04:03] Amazon sort of platform was called The
[04:05] Silk Road and um I don't know all the
[04:09] historical context and you know what
[04:11] this alludes to but it makes you think
[04:13] of the Silk Road trade from the Middle
[04:14] East to to Europe right um kind of in
[04:18] this novel free way and this was a
[04:20] platform that Ross built I don't know
[04:23] who is working with on it but he built
[04:25] this and it was a free and open
[04:26] Marketplace so kind of like open market
[04:29] capital and things that we talk about in
[04:31] the US at least uh things that maybe the
[04:34] West were built on right like free
[04:36] people making their own free decisions
[04:38] that when they don't impact other people
[04:41] um this is great like this is kind of
[04:43] the whole point of Commerce and money
[04:44] and savings and Free Will and subjective
[04:47] value so all these things were
[04:48] beautifully beautifully tied in and uh
[04:52] you know I sent a tweet as soon as I
[04:53] woke up I saw this photo of Ross walking
[04:55] with his plant and I just can't help but
[04:58] think like you know probably in 10 years
[05:00] we'll be listening to this podcast and
[05:02] we'll just be thinking man like I woke
[05:05] up to snow in North Carolina Ross is
[05:08] free totally iconic
[05:11] um I think what I tweeted out was that
[05:13] cernus and Galilea were early as well
[05:17] and you know look what happened to them
[05:18] I just want to bring that picture
[05:20] quickly up uh that that's that's a
[05:23] picture you talking about with the pl it
[05:25] was so lovely someone said like oh like
[05:27] he takes care of his seeds
[05:30] yeah I mean come on like can we just
[05:32] pause in this for a second like look at
[05:34] could you find a better shot like look
[05:36] at the proportion the smile the motion
[05:39] um the plan just like whoever took this
[05:41] it just worked so yeah that's a banger
[05:44] for
[05:44] sure it's a it's a really good one by
[05:47] the way I just wanted to uh show this
[05:49] also uh on Wikipedia it's already there
[05:52] that he got his pardon after yeah like I
[05:55] think it's now just uh was was it today
[05:58] in the morning or was it yesterday I
[05:59] cannot remember but I think it was like
[06:02] in America yesterday but in Europe today
[06:05] if I'm correct yeah yeah it was funny so
[06:08] I guess we're recording this early
[06:09] Wednesday us time uh Monday was Trump's
[06:12] inauguration I think he was up quite
[06:14] late signing executive orders one after
[06:16] the other uh just going and then he had
[06:19] a ball but yeah so Tuesday I guess his
[06:21] first full day in office um he did a
[06:24] full pardon it wasn't just a commuion of
[06:26] the sentence it was uh full pardon so
[06:29] he's completely out and it's just so
[06:31] exciting you know CU I have friends now
[06:33] working on uh open marketplaces with
[06:36] Noster and lightning and it's like you
[06:38] look at the tech and back then it was um
[06:41] we didn't even have segwit we didn't
[06:42] have a lot of these privacy preserving
[06:44] measures people would pay hashes they
[06:46] wouldn't pay addresses in Bitcoin there
[06:48] was no lightning and so um you know like
[06:51] in a in a project I'm uh sorry in a in a
[06:55] um in a competition I'm in right now for
[06:58] for Bronto one of the guys separate from
[07:00] Bronto is working on something called
[07:02] shopster and it's very much like the
[07:04] Silk Road but it's like with Naser
[07:07] everybody has their own private keys for
[07:09] social media and it's using lightning
[07:11] which is you know a huge Improvement so
[07:13] it's just incredible to see the
[07:15] progress I love to see that by the way
[07:18] um I I as an European or or maybe I'm
[07:22] also not English speaking enough for
[07:24] that but what is a partner actually like
[07:25] is that just means deletes the sentence
[07:28] or can he get evicted for something in
[07:30] the future something similar what what
[07:32] is what do full part mean yeah that's a
[07:34] good question I don't know the legality
[07:36] I know it's um more widespread and
[07:38] encompassing so like you would rather
[07:39] get pardoned than just have your
[07:41] sentence commuted I think by having the
[07:43] pardon it's it's more along the lines of
[07:45] hey you actually never did anything
[07:47] wrong like sorry this happened we're
[07:50] actually like erasing your bad
[07:52] reputation making it better I think the
[07:54] sentence commission is just reducing the
[07:56] sentence okay so like the sentence
[07:58] commission would be like oh yeah you're
[07:59] free now uh but the thing you said in
[08:02] there was still valid and Parton is like
[08:05] oh sorry we made a mistake and you're
[08:07] fully that makes sense yeah I never
[08:08] actually never looked it up what a
[08:10] pardon is I always knew like oh if you
[08:13] have a Pon you get out out of jail but I
[08:15] never was like like what exactly
[08:17] actually is this interesting yeah well
[08:19] and you know the important thing too and
[08:21] like why I wanted to just open with this
[08:23] is because the ramifications are massive
[08:25] right like developers been thrown in
[08:28] jail on repeated occasions for writing
[08:32] code that's open source and not killing
[08:36] people um that's really really really
[08:39] bad and it really puts a freeze on um
[08:42] the industry right because we all know
[08:45] you can write code and you can write
[08:47] anything you want it's like speech it
[08:48] just comes out of your head onto the
[08:50] keyboard and you can put it out in the
[08:52] public and uh just from building so much
[08:55] I think you probably know a lot of
[08:56] Builders as well um I've seen the effect
[08:59] people are scared to touch certain
[09:01] things so I think this is definitely a
[09:03] massive step in the right direction yeah
[09:05] I wanted to say that uh earlier because
[09:08] it feels like programming is kind of a
[09:11] language a language you speak to a
[09:13] computer and especially if you make it
[09:16] open source especially uh but even if
[09:18] you don't make it open source like
[09:20] programming is a language and it should
[09:22] be protected on the freedom of speech am
[09:23] am I am I wrong on that no no you're
[09:26] you're totally right um I mean I think
[09:28] it mostly is in the US but you know the
[09:30] justice system the department of
[09:32] whatever all these all these departments
[09:34] can persecute anyways that's the that's
[09:35] the issue interesting uh um but yeah
[09:38] let's uh let's jum maybe before we jump
[09:41] into into your topic with PR uh would be
[09:44] interesting to know in general what what
[09:46] do you think of of of trump now taking
[09:48] office of maybe Bitcoin maybe Bitcoin
[09:51] being the Strategic Bitcoin uh maybe the
[09:54] US making a Bitcoin strategic Bitcoin
[09:57] Reserve yeah and all those things that
[10:00] we might see this this year yeah um well
[10:04] I'm excited for when Bitcoin becomes the
[10:07] world Reserve currency um but it's a
[10:09] process you know it's it's not black and
[10:11] white I think when he signs it and I
[10:13] think he will it's going to be huge um
[10:16] what do I think of trump I mean I voted
[10:18] for him three
[10:20] times uh huge fan you know I've never
[10:24] trusted the media the first time I voted
[10:26] for him I'll tell you Robin uh I was
[10:28] starting my career in New York City very
[10:30] blue very
[10:31] Democratic and I was working at a
[10:33] company Bloomberg and I woke up in the
[10:36] morning Hillary lost Trump won I was
[10:38] overjoyed it was one of the happiest
[10:39] days of my life I was I was so pumped I
[10:42] called my brother on the phone I said no
[10:44] way he did it he's in and uh you know
[10:48] his hair is just so good it was just it
[10:50] was
[10:51] amazing so so I went into the office and
[10:54] uh you know I'm going to throw this guy
[10:56] under the bus and this is a little bit
[10:58] mean but there's a guy named he's a
[10:59] fully grown man I'm in the Bloomberg
[11:01] office this professional place this
[11:03] guy's crying he's got tissues he's got
[11:04] Kleenex on his desk he's crying he's
[11:07] he's you know like wiping his eyes I've
[11:09] got a huge smile on my face my my body
[11:12] language is vibrant I'm just pulsing
[11:14] with energy I'm just optimistic I'm
[11:16] happy and I'm like all right I guess I'm
[11:18] just going to go and write some code but
[11:20] after we Party nah these guys were in
[11:22] there crying the guy next to me and uh
[11:25] anyways that's what I think of trump I
[11:27] voted for him three times um you know I
[11:29] think he he really speaks to the people
[11:31] U he puts America First they're simple
[11:33] things uh I'm not I'm not going off of
[11:36] any conspiracies here I just like the
[11:38] policy um I also like the entertainment
[11:40] so I think for the industry it's a
[11:42] massive sigh of relief you know uh he
[11:45] spoke in Nashville this year that was
[11:47] fantastic um he's engaging with our
[11:50] industry he's not pushing us abroad
[11:52] right so guys like me it's very easy to
[11:55] think like hey like should I look at El
[11:57] Salvador should I look at Dubai should I
[11:59] do something with a company should I
[12:01] look at jurisdictional options um and
[12:04] under Biden yeah you should under Kamala
[12:07] yeah you should because who are these
[12:08] people they're not um they're not
[12:12] they're not on your side you don't get
[12:13] that feeling with Trump you know I I
[12:16] hope for Clear regulation that lets
[12:17] everybody cooperate and I think we'll
[12:20] get that so yeah very very
[12:24] optimistic and it's uh entertaining is a
[12:26] good like I I try to not uh focus on any
[12:30] American politics I'm in Europe like
[12:33] it's it's not something of really vocal
[12:35] points I just heard some things of
[12:38] Harris and I was like oh like that's
[12:40] cannot be good uh especially if you if
[12:42] you're talking about unrealized Capal
[12:44] gains and stuff like that were like
[12:45] really Socialist Communist ideas that I
[12:48] heard from her um but what I find really
[12:52] wholesome is uh him dancing yesterday
[12:55] the YMCA with The Sword and the the cake
[12:58] that that was just like oh like he he
[13:00] has fun and uh and he def like he he
[13:04] seems to have the right attitude for for
[13:06] the job I feel like from just like a
[13:08] personal standpoint um one thing that I
[13:11] was a little bit disappointed that he's
[13:13] going too much in the [ __ ] conary this
[13:15] like mean coins I was like okay why does
[13:18] he do that but then I saw that he was
[13:22] asked about it and he clearly had like
[13:24] almost no
[13:26] clue what this even was he was he he was
[13:30] answering like oh like how did how good
[13:32] did he do and stuff like that I think
[13:34] there just someone that handles that for
[13:36] him and he has almost no oversight of
[13:38] that um what do you think of of of of
[13:42] him making not only not not only
[13:44] embracing Bitcoin but seemingly also
[13:46] embracing and inviting crypto in general
[13:49] uh to to the White House is that
[13:51] something
[13:52] uh good even for bad or maybe even bad
[13:55] for Bitcoin no I mean like yeah hear you
[13:59] I mean I don't have a take like my take
[14:00] is I hate shitcoins uh it's Bitcoin
[14:03] lightning or bust um my second take is
[14:05] even when like we say the word Trump you
[14:07] know that's actually the last name of a
[14:09] lot of people like there's a lot of
[14:10] Trumps when we speak about Trump we're
[14:12] talking about Donald Trump so I think
[14:14] that's a good
[14:15] deliniation and with that you know his
[14:17] name is used everywhere you get big
[14:20] you've got a company you've got real
[14:21] estate you've got this that um and so
[14:25] yeah you know I think there's a lot of
[14:27] people involved putting a lot of
[14:28] pressure on definitely trying to use and
[14:30] basically tarnish the Trump name uh by
[14:33] associating with anything other than
[14:34] Bitcoin and you know that's I guess
[14:38] that's my first thought my only second
[14:40] thought is like maybe we accelerate
[14:41] quicker like cats out of the bag he he
[14:44] haha everybody knows these other coins
[14:47] are a joke so like why not make it a
[14:49] really loud joke so I I think it's very
[14:53] I think it's very bullish for Bitcoin I
[14:55] think we're going to accelerate here
[14:56] pretty hard absolutely and it's also uh
[14:59] maybe maybe crypto is for a lot of
[15:01] people the Gateway truck to to to
[15:04] bitcoin it's like the the ENT entry
[15:07] thing to and then you you go into cryp
[15:10] to you maybe go do different [ __ ] coins
[15:12] and then you all are like oh like my
[15:15] [ __ ] is going down this shitcoin going
[15:17] up then it's going down it's like oh
[15:18] there's this one constant that's just
[15:21] the the the the one thing that always
[15:24] shines and it's Bitcoin so it's will be
[15:27] interesting to see uh how it shakes up
[15:29] and what he really does in the next four
[15:30] years for for Bitcoin and and and for
[15:32] that uh I don't I do think Trump seems
[15:35] to be really positive for uh America uh
[15:39] and I think it will be also really
[15:41] positive to bitcoin even though I heard
[15:43] the argument of maybe a government that
[15:47] uh kind of rips about the US dollar
[15:49] might even be better for for Bitcoin
[15:52] because that's the world Reserve
[15:53] currency and maybe we coming with chaos
[15:57] faster to bitcoin world but I think
[15:59] that's not uh that we should not aim for
[16:01] that we should not cheer for that uh but
[16:03] I I heard that argument multiple times
[16:06] uh before before he was elected is super
[16:09] interesting but uh uh what actually you
[16:12] doing in in in Bitcoin space I I heard
[16:15] uh you trying to prevent bitcoiners from
[16:18] getting
[16:19] scammed yeah yeah that's what we're
[16:22] trying to do um because that's still a
[16:24] problem uh yeah so that's exactly what
[16:26] we're trying to do uh what we're working
[16:28] on is Bronto and kind of the original
[16:31] vision for Bronto was like let's let's
[16:33] uh try and add to the industry let's
[16:35] build something that augments everybody
[16:37] that um I don't want to say nobody's
[16:39] done before nobody's tried before um but
[16:42] let's try something different that can
[16:44] not come in and compete like I'm not
[16:46] interested in building a wallet or an
[16:47] exchange or an
[16:49] offramp um there there are there's a lot
[16:51] of innovation around all that for sure
[16:53] and there's a lot of players executing
[16:55] what I am super paranoid about Robin is
[16:59] the use of these
[17:00] addresses that's kind of like the last
[17:03] mile problem that I'm really concerned
[17:04] about and so what I mean by that is um
[17:08] you know when you have a long Bitcoin
[17:10] address or a lightning address you
[17:12] rarely rarely type it out and see it
[17:14] being typed out most people copy that
[17:18] address and actually the
[17:21] clipboard is open on the computer so
[17:25] it's not it's not really encrypted it's
[17:27] plain text for every program there's no
[17:30] pseudo access required so when you go to
[17:33] copy a
[17:34] password
[17:36] unfortunately other applications can
[17:38] just be pulling your clipboard and
[17:40] reading the data in there so this is
[17:43] really bad but this also applies to
[17:45] bitcoin addresses right so of course you
[17:47] would never put a private key and copy
[17:49] like an xpv on your on your computer we
[17:52] do do that with NX on Noster which is
[17:54] not good but this sort of this sort of
[17:57] thing where like humans start
[17:58] interacting acting with Bitcoin at a
[18:00] high level is is very bothersome to me
[18:03] and I said okay let me just throw myself
[18:05] at this problem like people have to in
[18:08] some level pay their dues to bitcoin I
[18:10] don't like this thing let me just throw
[18:11] myself at it see what happens let's call
[18:13] it bronta and let's just run with it
[18:16] interesting um is is the Clipper
[18:18] actually open all devices is that or is
[18:21] it a laptop kind of a thing yeah so um
[18:25] on desktop it's quite open so Mac Linux
[18:28] most Linux distributions and windows uh
[18:31] yeah you can just write a program that
[18:32] pulls that any time uh so that's desktop
[18:36] and then on on mobile um I haven't
[18:39] actually looked into that much iOS is
[18:41] quite closed down and they have closed
[18:43] this down more I think Androids done the
[18:45] same uh so it varies per operating
[18:48] system but yeah the the kicker is when
[18:50] you copy an address every other program
[18:53] can sense that and look at that and do
[18:56] whatever they want with that yeah
[18:58] because uh my iPhone always ask me oh uh
[19:03] is is that app allowed to get from your
[19:06] clipboard and and and stuff like that
[19:08] and I never thought about that as as an
[19:09] attack reactor it's super interesting is
[19:12] that the most common way people are
[19:14] getting attacked in in in
[19:16] Bitcoin I don't you know I think people
[19:18] mostly just attack their themselves in
[19:20] Bitcoin to be
[19:22] honest um no I don't know if it's the
[19:25] most common way but it certainly is like
[19:26] it's like a piece that's not that's not
[19:29] clear you know like like my whole thesis
[19:31] is
[19:32] that this probably isn't true but what I
[19:34] like to believe is that the internet was
[19:36] built to invent Bitcoin everything else
[19:39] is a mistake so this is kind of my
[19:41] thesis on like when humans interact with
[19:44] Bitcoin it needs to be airtight and so
[19:47] like I think about Steve Jobs a lot and
[19:49] how the human interfaces with the
[19:51] machine because right like in my MacBook
[19:53] I've the MacBook looks kind of decent it
[19:55] looks okay it's got nice aluminum
[19:57] unibody but inside is very ugly but that
[20:00] interface is very important in the
[20:02] blockchain you can kind of think like
[20:04] this the blockchain is beautiful
[20:05] mathematically for sure this is like
[20:08] axiomatic mathematics it's first
[20:10] principles from from physics you can
[20:11] even think from this way but the Bitcoin
[20:13] blockchain is beautiful there's at least
[20:15] 20,000 of them on planet Earth stored on
[20:17] hard diss uh zeros and ones so it
[20:20] operates perfectly but then humans still
[20:22] have to manipulate that blockchain for
[20:24] this to be money through time and space
[20:26] and so um
[20:29] work work is needed work is needed and
[20:31] so yeah kind one of the first things we
[20:34] tackled is I said okay the clipboard is
[20:36] garbage it's not bitcoin's fault it's
[20:38] not my fault just how the operating
[20:40] systems are right so the first thing
[20:43] that we built was uh Bronto for desktop
[20:46] and what that did that does it's an
[20:48] ambient background app you can just run
[20:50] it's free it's open source and it will
[20:53] show you in real time hey what's in your
[20:54] clipboard do you have a Bitcoin address
[20:57] do you have an xpub stuff like this and
[21:00] you know we never saw that so we put
[21:01] that out for people to look at
[21:03] interesting how do you imagine um uh I
[21:06] mean that's a little bit away from the
[21:08] security topic but uh how do you imagine
[21:10] the future user interface and user
[21:12] experience of of Bitcoin looking like I
[21:14] think that's super interesting to think
[21:15] about yeah yeah for sure I mean there's
[21:18] a lot of things to balance right like
[21:19] end of the day we need peer-to-peer
[21:21] digital cash that kind of is the point
[21:23] um you can hand something to any to to
[21:26] anybody else anywhere that's the whole
[21:28] kind of product Market fit that's the
[21:30] whole value out of Bitcoin now with that
[21:33] being said how are we going to interact
[21:35] with it look I mean you know the Bitcoin
[21:38] address schematics they're so baked in
[21:41] there's so much product there's so much
[21:42] Legacy code already around what we call
[21:46] Bitcoin addresses so I don't think those
[21:47] are going away like those are very
[21:49] useful you can program with them you can
[21:51] manipulate them and code very
[21:53] articulately so it has a use case
[21:56] problem is that use case doesn't
[21:58] translate to my children on the beach
[22:02] you know to to Everyday People right of
[22:06] course lightning is coming on top of
[22:07] this we'll talk about that in a second
[22:08] but I think things like you know there's
[22:11] a lot of interesting ideas right now
[22:13] like reusable address silent payments
[22:15] static payments DNS text records um like
[22:19] human readable names I think that's kind
[22:21] of the delineation is like a segwit
[22:23] address is not really human readable you
[22:26] see bc1 q and then you know it's segwit
[22:28] and then you know there's a there's a
[22:30] there's a string behind it but if you
[22:32] had a human readable address like if I
[22:34] open up a lightning app on my phone and
[22:36] I have Keith at whatever um that's human
[22:40] readable so it'll be interesting I think
[22:42] there's going to be a lot of solutions
[22:43] and we'll just see which one
[22:45] wins yeah it will also be interesting of
[22:47] of um how how user friendly we have to
[22:51] make Bitcoin the first layer layer as
[22:54] it's not available for everyone uh any
[22:58] ways in in the future because it will be
[23:00] limited and and only big players will be
[23:02] on there or like rather big players uh
[23:05] uh so maybe anyways have to focus more
[23:08] on Lightning Layer Two Solutions and
[23:10] layer three solutions and apps and I
[23:12] have to say like lightning apps on
[23:14] average are way easier and better to to
[23:18] navigate as a user than any Bitcoin apps
[23:20] it's already there I'm like like
[23:22] lightning ABS it's it's pretty pretty
[23:24] simple to to comprehend it's something
[23:27] that I can just depending on if it's
[23:30] custodial non-custodial or what kind of
[23:34] app is is but you you could possibly
[23:35] give it to uh your dad or your mom and
[23:38] like like navigate through that you you
[23:40] you will you will get it because you get
[23:42] normal banking apps also and I hope we
[23:45] get to the point where it's just like
[23:47] Bitcoin just feels like another uh
[23:50] fintech banking app from from from the
[23:53] from the user friendliness where you
[23:55] just like find your for example in AUST
[23:58] I don't know how the banking system in
[23:59] America is but in Austria there are
[24:00] banks where you can connect um the name
[24:04] and someone's phone number and you can
[24:06] just directly send them some money
[24:09] especially if they're the same bank but
[24:10] even if they at other Banks and you like
[24:12] oh like send $5 to Mom and and then it's
[24:16] like Mom gets it and like it's instant
[24:18] and like we really need super simple use
[24:21] interface interface on on the top uh
[24:25] layer and yeah Bitcoin on the base layer
[24:28] maybe we don't even need it there maybe
[24:31] it can be rough yeah yeah I mean I think
[24:34] on some level it definitely can and I
[24:36] mean my mindset it always is always like
[24:38] very conservative with Bitcoin core you
[24:40] know like the protocol is the protocol
[24:42] every time you wide in the design space
[24:45] you uh you have to let that marinate for
[24:48] a long time and need to be very careful
[24:51] about opening the design space in the
[24:53] first place but yeah to your point on
[24:55] Lightning 100% um moving
[24:58] utxos uh through you know Bitcoin blocks
[25:03] uh people are going to be using
[25:04] lightning they're not going to be
[25:05] they're not going to be going on chain
[25:07] and and I think you already see the ux
[25:09] is just phenomenal it's just totally
[25:11] phenomenal on
[25:13] lightning is is lightning for you the
[25:15] the number one solution for Layer Two is
[25:17] that already
[25:19] foreseeable yeah you know um Lightning's
[25:23] complicated like the Bitcoin white paper
[25:25] is one thing the lightning white paper
[25:27] is a whole another Beast and yeah it's
[25:29] really interesting because on the one
[25:30] hand lightning works really really well
[25:32] I'm also not the I'm not the most expert
[25:34] on Lightning but um I think my take is
[25:37] that you see a lot of quite mature
[25:39] lightning infrastructure providers
[25:41] already um yet at the same time it feels
[25:44] like there's
[25:45] uh there's a lot of action on Lightning
[25:48] right now so I'm I'm really excited for
[25:50] what what comes out with this will will
[25:53] will be fun to see um but yeah back to
[25:55] the security topic I'm really interested
[25:57] in in in that um maybe as a starting
[26:00] point you already said that the most
[26:02] common ways people lose their the ex the
[26:04] fund is usually themselves just like
[26:07] messing up the self custodianship um is
[26:11] that is the number one what is the what
[26:13] are maybe let's go with some of the most
[26:16] common ways of people getting scammed or
[26:20] losing the access or getting haed or
[26:21] whatever yeah yeah totally um you know I
[26:25] I think about this all the time like
[26:26] 24/7 for months and month and months now
[26:29] and I think it kind of comes down to
[26:30] this question of where are you actually
[26:33] sending your Bitcoin that's all it is
[26:35] right like you can think of Bitcoin as a
[26:38] baseball or a football and that baseball
[26:41] is either in motion or it's not in
[26:43] motion it's very simple right so like
[26:45] your bitcoin's at rest something
[26:47] triggers it and then it's no longer in
[26:49] rest it's in the mle and then your
[26:50] Bitcoin lands somewhere else right
[26:52] that's kind of what happens and
[26:54] ultimately whenever we think of somebody
[26:56] being attacked or fished unless if you
[26:58] actually transfer ownership of the seed
[27:00] phrase that's kind of a different that's
[27:03] kind of a different theoretical angle
[27:05] because if somebody takes your seed
[27:06] phrase they haven't moved your uh utxo
[27:09] set they have just they have the ability
[27:12] to do that uh but usually when we're
[27:15] talking about people getting tricked
[27:17] getting scammed getting fished it's that
[27:20] they sent their Bitcoin somewhere where
[27:21] they didn't mean to that's the whole
[27:24] trick so earlier this year in the spring
[27:26] I had a friend call me and and uh yeah
[27:29] you know he was basically just getting
[27:30] fished and he came very close to sending
[27:33] um to sending Bitcoin uh to a fake
[27:36] person that's a great example of just
[27:38] getting tricked and kind of kicking
[27:40] yourself in the foot or shooting
[27:42] yourself in the foot right um so like
[27:45] what this is a broad problem but what we
[27:46] are trying to solve is whenever you go
[27:49] to send your Bitcoin anywhere we want to
[27:51] empower the person sending their Bitcoin
[27:54] to double check and verify that their
[27:56] Bitcoin is going to end up where they
[27:57] want it to be
[27:58] and to me that's a very profound idea
[28:01] it's very nuanced I don't want the
[28:03] general public to have to think about
[28:05] that this is the whole point but like
[28:09] anytime if I go to deposit Bitcoin into
[28:11] an exchange if I go to pay an invoice if
[28:13] I go to pay you Robin what happens is
[28:16] somebody else in SpaceTime is presenting
[28:20] me an address to send my Bitcoin to now
[28:24] that transfer is the thing that we want
[28:26] to lock down and offer a guarant of
[28:28] because that's the thing that people
[28:30] attack so if I wanted to direct an
[28:32] attack uh one example of this is I could
[28:37] put out a bad npm package in JavaScript
[28:40] it could get in the web browser and it
[28:41] could get in the browser extensions of a
[28:43] lot of people right this would be very
[28:45] bad and if that browser extension
[28:47] somehow were to change that web page and
[28:51] and look it for Bitcoin addresses and
[28:52] then change them before people pay well
[28:55] this is a huge problem because with visa
[28:57] and M card you have fraud department
[28:59] with Bitcoin once you broadcast
[29:02] transaction uh that's a one-way thing so
[29:04] you lose your money forever and it's
[29:07] quite easy actually to change the
[29:09] characters on somebody's
[29:10] screen so in you know in a nutshell I
[29:13] know I kind of rambled there but I think
[29:15] that's that's kind of the design that's
[29:17] kind of like the problem area we're
[29:19] tackling so in a way you should uh
[29:23] double check okay where to what address
[29:26] do you actually want to send it uh what
[29:28] is the address on myah wallet or
[29:31] whatever you want to sign it with uh and
[29:33] then like what is like you always have
[29:35] like two free spaces where you have to
[29:37] make sure the address is actually uh the
[29:39] same thing and I know because I I come a
[29:42] little bit from it security I know with
[29:43] the main names you can make them look
[29:46] like something but it that isn't really
[29:49] that with like Len I and like there some
[29:51] tricks in there um is that also common
[29:53] of like just uh but yeah especially with
[29:57] like that long you probably don't even
[29:58] have to trick trick so much around
[30:00] because most people don't like double
[30:02] check it too
[30:03] much yeah yeah totally um yeah like in
[30:07] Bitcoin you can do these things called
[30:09] vanity addresses which is basically a
[30:11] process where you can just generate a
[30:13] lot of addresses within your own wallet
[30:16] uh common wallets have like two two
[30:18] billion single use addresses that's a
[30:20] lot and you can just look at all of them
[30:22] and see which one looks most similar to
[30:25] another address and so if I want to to
[30:28] as an attacker wanted to swap the
[30:30] address you see on your iPhone or in
[30:33] your clipboard or on your Chrome browser
[30:36] I could go through some vanity addresses
[30:38] get one that looks kind of similar maybe
[30:40] the first eight almost match the last
[30:42] eight almost match something like that
[30:44] and then that would probably have a
[30:46] higher chance of you just glazing over
[30:48] it depending right there's use cases if
[30:50] you're sending
[30:52] $10 or if you're sending a thousand
[30:55] maybe you care at a different level I
[30:57] partnered with coin vigilante this is
[31:00] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[31:03] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[31:06] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[31:08] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[31:12] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[31:15] go out there and show that you are a
[31:17] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[31:20] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[31:23] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:26] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:29] collections you have the date of the
[31:31] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[31:34] and of course also the block height and
[31:37] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[31:40] the level of detail they put in in this
[31:43] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[31:45] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:48] down in the descriptions I love those
[31:51] watches so so much if you watch or
[31:54] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:56] I'll guess you all already bought some
[31:59] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[32:01] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[32:05] in a hardware wallet my personal
[32:06] recommendation for harder wallet is the
[32:09] bit box it's super secure it's simple to
[32:11] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[32:13] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[32:16] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[32:20] with the code Robin at the checkout
[32:22] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[32:26] your bitbox and then next step is to
[32:28] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:31] individual you have to have the most
[32:33] secure self- custody setup you have to
[32:36] secure your own devices you have to
[32:39] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:42] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:44] where you live you even want to have a
[32:46] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:49] in case something goes really really
[32:51] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:53] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:56] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[32:58] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[33:02] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[33:05] how you can level up your sovereignty
[33:08] right yeah like big big transactions
[33:10] you're like double checking and like the
[33:12] the blood pressure and the heart rate is
[33:14] is is accelerating and stuff like that
[33:17] maybe that's a maybe that's a good good
[33:20] thing that we can with no this this is
[33:22] what we've always said is like um you
[33:24] know what we have is guardrail BR to
[33:26] guardrail and
[33:28] uh the point is that we don't want
[33:29] emotional guard rails like on one hand
[33:32] it's fine but like people feel really
[33:33] nervous people feel apprehensive they're
[33:35] not sure like how do you know when you
[33:38] transact Bitcoin and just send it into
[33:39] the ether for the average person you
[33:42] have no idea where it's going but they
[33:43] feel very emotional and that's the only
[33:45] thing preventing them from messing up is
[33:47] their emotions so it's like man we can
[33:49] we can build something that uh improves
[33:52] that for sure for
[33:54] sure emotions play a big big big role in
[33:57] that
[33:58] I feel like what um is so so what you're
[34:02] saying is is people sending Bitcoin to a
[34:05] wrong address or the scammer address is
[34:08] the the more common one and the the
[34:10] stealing of the private Keys uh or like
[34:13] maybe someone I yeah I think like people
[34:17] are getting really careful now with like
[34:19] you you're sending an email or you get
[34:22] do some some website where you have to
[34:24] enter your private keys or your seat
[34:26] phrase to recover something and it's not
[34:28] the real website I gets it gets less
[34:30] common or does it yeah yeah no I mean
[34:33] that is the problem like there there's
[34:34] so much irony here right it's like okay
[34:37] um Allan Turing invented computation
[34:40] Steve Jobs and other guys invented
[34:42] computers we could actually use Satoshi
[34:44] gave us digital scarcity um but yet like
[34:48] we haven't perfected these edge cases of
[34:51] can people use this thing and have like
[34:53] a locktite
[34:55] guarantee um so yeah like you know you
[34:58] touch on that point of the address swap
[35:01] I think so people that have Ledger or
[35:03] cold card you all everybody knows um
[35:06] there's a screen on the device and you
[35:08] can look at every character in that
[35:10] address and check it to what you think
[35:13] makes sense now that's great like that
[35:16] is basically
[35:17] non-negotiable um Hardware walls with
[35:19] screens are necessary they need to show
[35:21] you the change address the the sending
[35:23] address all this all this data right
[35:25] couple important pieces um
[35:28] um that's great I think that problem has
[35:31] been solved pretty well there's always
[35:33] supply chain things there's always you
[35:34] know oneoff occurrences that can happen
[35:37] in diligence needed but the really
[35:39] really brutal thing is where did you get
[35:42] that address in the first place so I
[35:45] love cold card I love Ledger they're
[35:47] great treasure yeah but okay how did I
[35:50] get that address and who actually told
[35:52] me to pay and kind of where I'm going
[35:54] with this is like the point is I don't
[35:56] trust my browser and AI is Savage now
[36:00] right so like there's deep fakes there's
[36:02] really good deep fakes they not even
[36:03] expensive so you can have kids basically
[36:07] spinning up images of you because you
[36:09] have so many uh videos and content of
[36:11] your voice and your demeanor and your
[36:14] the pixels showing on my screen that
[36:15] look like Robin you know um so it's not
[36:19] hard to make a fake video of you now and
[36:22] the point is like where did the address
[36:23] come from did it actually come from
[36:25] Robin well we need some way to check
[36:27] this right because if I check uh an
[36:30] address given with to me in telegram
[36:33] from who I think is Robin with my cold
[36:35] card great I checked my telegram didn't
[36:37] get hacked but I was talking to a fake
[36:40] Robin in the first place right jokes on
[36:42] me like that's a big problem like am I
[36:45] talk even right now like am I talking to
[36:47] real you or fake you I don't really know
[36:49] I'm just sitting here in North Carolina
[36:51] you're across the ocean there's a cable
[36:55] they say that goes under the Atlant
[36:58] IC I'm trusting my web browser I'm
[37:00] trusting Mac OS um I'm trusting my local
[37:04] wifi uh it I mean how like how many
[37:06] components are in a stack and so if you
[37:09] you know I don't know if there's a chat
[37:10] in Riverside there is I guess if you
[37:12] just dropped a segwood address or
[37:14] lightning like an Ln
[37:16] URL um I I just don't know it's you you
[37:19] know and so like cryptographic methods
[37:21] are good for that right so if you had a
[37:23] private key and you signed something
[37:25] then I have a cryptographic guarantee of
[37:27] okay I think Robin has this key I know
[37:29] he has the key because we've met in
[37:30] person he signed the message now I know
[37:32] it's him but without that who's on the
[37:34] other end that's what Bron is doing is
[37:36] who's on the other end of who you're
[37:37] paying because getting the address
[37:39] checking the characters like cool but
[37:42] like am I actually talking to the person
[37:44] I think I
[37:45] am and there's there's some interesting
[37:48] stories I I can even share with that I
[37:51] recently was invited to do uh another
[37:54] podcast and uh he was like when we
[37:57] jumped into the video call he's like oh
[37:59] why did you not respond to my telegram
[38:01] messages and I'm like I didn't get any
[38:03] telegram messages turns out he talked to
[38:05] an impersonator of me
[38:09] on yeah tell us about that I want I want
[38:11] to hear that that sounds funny oh it's
[38:14] it's not uh not a lot more he sent me uh
[38:18] the link to ACC access studio and
[38:21] everything to a telegram impersonator
[38:23] there was he did not reply to that uh so
[38:26] like there was no ation going on and the
[38:29] interesting thing is uh I sent him like
[38:31] one minute before like hey where is the
[38:33] link uh on on on Twitter actually not on
[38:36] Telegram and he's like oh I sent it to
[38:38] you on telegram but here it is and I
[38:39] said like no I didn't never get it and
[38:42] turns out he messaged and just an
[38:45] impersonator because they're like I
[38:47] don't know like there there 10 20 Robin
[38:49] cus on on telegram so if you type in my
[38:51] name you'll like see multiples of them
[38:54] uh and uh even though I use always
[38:57] exactly the same handle like Robin zire
[39:00] just my name together like with no no
[39:04] nothing else uh but still people get
[39:07] confused and the more interesting thing
[39:08] what you just said with AI is I um sent
[39:13] my girlfriend uh um like a 30 seconds 40
[39:18] seconds short message uh on WhatsApp a
[39:23] voice message and this voice me message
[39:26] comes from Riverside Riverside has a
[39:27] tool where you can generate your own
[39:30] voice um with just text from all your
[39:34] recordings and it is so so so good uh
[39:37] frightening good actually and I sent it
[39:39] to her and she didn't notice
[39:43] it oh man so if your own girlfriend is
[39:48] uh not noticing
[39:51] over uh the phone if it's actually you
[39:55] or an AI like then you can fake it to
[39:58] everyone uh in person it's something
[40:00] different because over the phone you
[40:02] accept a little bit of a different voice
[40:04] also but like uh like it it it's it's
[40:08] fascinating how far eii got and like be
[40:11] aware guys yeah there are scammers out
[40:14] there that are really creative and they
[40:16] only need one time a payoff and they are
[40:19] paid for like 100 guys that didn't fall
[40:22] for it but like one guy falls for it and
[40:24] that that's kind of like be be aware be
[40:27] be the 99% and not in the
[40:29] 1% yeah yeah it's uh it's brutal it's
[40:32] just totally brutal that's that's a
[40:35] that's funny I'm glad you shared that
[40:37] absolutely yeah um actually do you have
[40:41] uh statistics around uh people getting
[40:44] hack and scammed is the is there
[40:45] something public of like how many or
[40:48] like what's what's the volume of that I
[40:50] hear it all the time of of most the
[40:53] stories actually I hear is as you said
[40:55] the the the user error someone is like
[40:57] throwing away the girl the recent one
[41:00] that I heard was The Ledger one where
[41:01] the girlfriend threw away the paper
[41:03] where the seat phrase was on and he
[41:05] typed in the pin on The Ledger three
[41:07] times wrong yeah that that that story I
[41:10] heard that was
[41:12] heartbreaking but yeah uh do do you have
[41:15] any statistics around that actually yeah
[41:18] you know when people would first ask me
[41:20] this question um I would just say no I
[41:23] don't know I didn't look into it but you
[41:24] know it turns out like there actually
[41:26] aren't good statistics that's kind of
[41:28] what I found and this is one of these
[41:30] it's one of these weird areas where
[41:32] like the statistic is basically you hear
[41:34] about it more than you
[41:36] should like it it shouldn't happen like
[41:40] we well people say we put a man on the
[41:42] moon but like yeah people are getting
[41:44] tricked it's like these people just on
[41:46] the surface of the planet tricking each
[41:48] other um like what how is that still
[41:51] happening and like I get it like people
[41:53] are clever um the statistic that I focus
[41:56] on is like I know people in my own life
[41:58] that have gotten scammed for 600 bucks
[42:01] for five full Bitcoin um everywhere in
[42:04] between and uh it's just too much it's
[42:07] too much I don't have numbers I think a
[42:09] lot of the time people are quiet about
[42:12] it you know I think there's a lot of I
[42:14] suspect there's a lot of people out
[42:15] there who have lost money have done
[42:18] something silly but they're kind of
[42:19] embarrassed they're not the type to go
[42:21] write this out on Twitter like that guy
[42:22] with the Ledger in the three pins um I I
[42:26] think I briefly saw that in passing and
[42:29] uh it's brutal I mean good for that guy
[42:32] for posting that
[42:34] publicly I think it's good in some ways
[42:36] I think a lot of people aren't like that
[42:38] maybe they don't post ever so you know
[42:41] it's too many people ultimately and uh
[42:45] you know I it's just something it's not
[42:47] it's not a nice thing it's an ugly thing
[42:48] and like we need to get rid of the ugly
[42:50] components of Bitcoin um because we can
[42:53] it's it's not it's not hard it's within
[42:55] reach for sure
[42:57] yeah and this sharing of mistakes is
[43:00] something really valuable we can really
[43:02] learn uh from that um but yeah let's
[43:06] let's talk a little bit more about
[43:08] measurements uh um what we talked about
[43:11] some things like double checking the the
[43:13] copy and paste of the clipboard and and
[43:15] those things what else can can people do
[43:18] to avoid getting scammed yeah
[43:23] um that's a really really good question
[43:25] so ultimately I
[43:27] from the users perspective I would say
[43:29] let this industry
[43:30] mature like if you're not a tech guy but
[43:33] you understand Bitcoin just chill just
[43:35] stack some coin like realistically yes
[43:37] use it as medium of exchange I'm not
[43:39] saying hold it and never spend it never
[43:41] sell it maybe never sell your Bitcoin
[43:44] there's no second best but um look like
[43:47] don't yeah so look I mean the first
[43:49] thing is the industry is going to mature
[43:51] there's going to be Solutions where like
[43:53] this stuff is just airtight um every day
[43:55] the industry is moving forward great new
[43:57] Solutions are coming out best practices
[44:00] Etc and so um you know what like look
[44:03] how much look how far we've already came
[44:05] like these tools are phenomenal already
[44:07] so we're kind of talking edge cases I
[44:09] don't want to scare people too much like
[44:11] use Bitcoin but as it matures just
[44:13] understand this thing is only getting
[44:14] better like the amount of entropy and
[44:17] energy that very smart people are
[44:19] putting in is
[44:20] massive massive capital is inflowing to
[44:23] these companies investors are putting
[44:25] money in the builders are bu bu like the
[44:28] things are working so one things are
[44:30] getting better in terms of just today if
[44:33] you're going to use Bitcoin and I think
[44:34] you should just segregate it out have
[44:37] some deep
[44:38] ice have some deep uh Cold Storage right
[44:41] don't touch that that's just for saving
[44:43] be smart maybe use some two out of three
[44:46] collaborative custodian setup uh backup
[44:49] your seed phrases check your backup
[44:50] standard stuff like that and then have
[44:52] some play money on maybe a lightning app
[44:55] um it's a really good setup just common
[44:56] sense and stuff you
[44:58] know how do you like actually because uh
[45:01] I think a lot of the biger a big problem
[45:04] is actually people logging themselves
[45:06] out and making too much of a maze or
[45:08] like losing like spreading thems to fin
[45:12] how do you look at time locked keys that
[45:14] are uh uh getting active after like one
[45:17] year or two years of inactivity is that
[45:19] something that uh uh you're looking into
[45:23] yeah I like I like it a lot I like it I
[45:25] mean I'm I'm not thinking about the
[45:27] custodial part quite as much I'm really
[45:29] thinking about where did you get your
[45:31] address from um I feel like we're almost
[45:34] in good hands with the custodial part
[45:36] like there's some really cool stuff
[45:38] coming out with insurance schemes um
[45:41] multi-layered approaches I I don't want
[45:43] to name drop the products here uh time
[45:45] locks are super cool I think it's way
[45:48] underused um it's interesting because
[45:52] we're transitioning out of Fiat which is
[45:53] super high time
[45:55] preference and you know people just want
[45:58] access to their money and that kind of
[46:00] is the point of Bitcoin is
[46:02] like you it's liquid right like if I
[46:05] have a stock and bond in real estate
[46:07] portfolio like good luck zapping that to
[46:09] Tokyo can't do
[46:11] it um with Bitcoin the whole point is
[46:14] it's liquid 247 there is no after hours
[46:17] trading that you need to sell your
[46:18] stocks on or during hours trading
[46:20] there's no bank holidays it's 247 tick
[46:23] Tok next block um so I think you know
[46:26] people have shied away from the time
[46:27] lock stuff a little bit for that reason
[46:29] but it's super cool I think it's super
[46:31] cool for parts of your stack right um
[46:35] and I think there's probably a lot of
[46:36] creative use cases too like um maybe you
[46:39] blend that in with escros or game prizes
[46:41] or politics or elections like maybe you
[46:44] time lock Bitcoin before an election
[46:46] right um for the birth of a child things
[46:49] like this just just spitballing ideas I
[46:51] think it's a massively uh underexplored
[46:55] design space and I'd love to see I'd
[46:57] love to see Twitter and Noster talk
[46:59] about this much more because um it may
[47:02] be there's some stroke of Genius there
[47:04] that can just like crack open a whole
[47:06] new a whole new use case and like that's
[47:09] the cool thing like you've got Guys
[47:11] across the world just cracking open new
[47:13] use cases all the time and like look if
[47:15] you're a software engineer at home get
[47:17] in the game get in the arena make some
[47:19] moves start building some stuff start
[47:21] hacking there's grants there's a lot of
[47:23] Grants um these companies are hiring
[47:25] just like get into and especially if
[47:28] you're creative I think you can uh you
[47:31] know you can probably see something
[47:32] other people haven't seen and at least
[47:35] speaking from my perspective like come
[47:36] on board like we invite you and there
[47:38] are so many uh bitcoiner chop um uh size
[47:43] out there I cannot even name them all uh
[47:46] and if you go to any of those and search
[47:48] for like especially builder jobs uh like
[47:51] software engineers and stuff like that
[47:54] um you you you really fast find find one
[47:59] I just want to uh show people one of the
[48:03] many sites that are available uh Bitcoin
[48:06] at shobs uh and and there you you see
[48:10] software engineering jobs like you see
[48:12] uh all types of jobs also client
[48:14] relationship manager because a lot of
[48:16] people say like oh I'm I'm not a
[48:18] developer I don't find a job so like
[48:21] there's literally any job that you can
[48:23] do in any other industry you can
[48:24] definitely also do in in Bitcoin for
[48:27] Bitcoin company uh so it's a it's a
[48:29] small tension but I think uh it's it's
[48:31] it's something that um not enough people
[48:35] I think are considering uh the change of
[48:38] like you can you bring all your
[48:41] financial energy to bitcoin you're all
[48:43] in financial energy but you're still
[48:46] working for a company that you might not
[48:48] even like and there might be a great
[48:51] thing that you can do the same thing
[48:52] that you maybe have done for like 20 30
[48:55] years and do the same thing for a
[48:57] Bitcoin company work for a Bitcoin
[48:58] startup be in a in a Bitcoin environment
[49:01] and that that is a really cool feeling
[49:03] and I can just tell you from being in it
[49:06] security before and being now fully
[49:08] entrenched in Bitcoin uh it's different
[49:11] it's every day a a way better feeling
[49:15] for myself because it's better fit for
[49:17] myself if you're really uh big on it
[49:19] security maybe you want to stick with it
[49:21] security but I I wasn't so that's that's
[49:24] a really cool thing that we have in
[49:26] Bitcoin
[49:27] yeah that was super cool I mean the
[49:29] passion runs deep absolutely um one
[49:32] thing is also interesting with the
[49:34] private and public key that's the I was
[49:37] first introduced to that with Bitcoin uh
[49:39] that was like oh like there private
[49:41] public key things I heard about it
[49:43] before with like messages encryptions
[49:46] and in it security of course uh but like
[49:49] the use case was Bitcoin for me the
[49:50] first and now there's also Nostra where
[49:53] you also have uh the same concept
[49:55] basically do you think that is a
[49:58] superior model and will eventually
[50:01] replace the username password to fact Au
[50:06] authentification stuff yeah no I this is
[50:09] such a good question this this ties
[50:11] exactly what into what we're doing and
[50:13] what I think about every day um yeah
[50:15] yeah I think it does so yeah Noster um
[50:20] yeah so when we talk about like public
[50:22] private Keys that's something that user
[50:24] holds now and nobody else holds the
[50:27] private key only you now when we talk
[50:29] about user and password yeah you hold
[50:31] that but yeah the company holds that too
[50:34] so it's uh you're kind of on a leash um
[50:38] you know this is a really interesting
[50:41] inversion of power where with public
[50:43] private key we say asymmetric key
[50:46] signing well the asymmet the
[50:49] asymmetry is towards the individual
[50:53] that's the really key thing here is that
[50:56] the individual is the person that
[50:58] benefits from the power of public
[51:00] private key signing it's asymmetric but
[51:02] it's in your favor that's exactly what
[51:04] you want right like when investors talk
[51:06] about an informational Edge investors
[51:09] want um an asymmetric Advantage they
[51:12] want an advantage that other people
[51:13] don't
[51:14] have right and so yeah so therefore like
[51:18] public private key signing is super
[51:19] valuable um initially something like pgp
[51:22] was good definitely works um clunky
[51:24] though there's no sexy uis on top of
[51:27] that but I'll tell you what Noster
[51:30] Noster there are some very sexy uis
[51:32] Noster uses uh basically the same
[51:35] schematic at a high level uses the
[51:37] Bitcoin elliptical curve encryption but
[51:40] it's the same thing you have your own
[51:41] private key you can share your own
[51:43] public key with other people it's very
[51:45] beautiful and so you know when we talk
[51:48] about where do you get a Bitcoin address
[51:50] from um you know you're checking it on
[51:53] the cold card yeah great it matches the
[51:55] Bitcoin address in my email well well
[51:57] when we talk about where did that email
[51:58] actually come from what's going to
[52:00] happen over the next 10 years is that
[52:03] trust already has been obliterated and
[52:05] you need to look Upstream where's the
[52:06] source of the data and the source of the
[52:10] data is always going to go back to a
[52:11] very big number in the form of a private
[52:13] key that somebody else has so great
[52:16] example maybe August of
[52:19] 2024 sitting president of the United
[52:22] States Joe Biden tweeted out um he was
[52:25] going to run for the president again
[52:27] then he tweeted out he wasn't going to
[52:29] run for the presidency again cool what
[52:32] controls access to that is a is a
[52:34] username and password with access by who
[52:38] knows how many people right um the point
[52:42] being like we don't know where that
[52:43] communication came from we never will we
[52:45] can't like effectively but with
[52:48] something like private public key
[52:50] signing uh if that individual's already
[52:52] proven to like have used that private
[52:55] key if you see message signed by that
[52:57] private key Either he got compromised or
[53:00] more likely um he actually signed the
[53:02] message so this is the sort of thing
[53:05] where um you know the sovereign
[53:07] individual thesis to some extent uh is
[53:09] is definitely going to play out I think
[53:11] people holding their own Keys is just
[53:13] how do you take that away because it's
[53:14] cheap to make a a private key it's cheap
[53:17] it's free you can do it on a consumer
[53:19] device uh that's incredible and when I
[53:21] look at things like okay I just received
[53:23] an invoice for my real estate business
[53:25] for my
[53:27] it business for whatever for Education
[53:30] um if there's an address in there I'm
[53:32] going to be looking for a signature on
[53:33] that address otherwise I'm not paying
[53:35] anybody why would I pay a Bitcoin
[53:37] address that hasn't been signed by a
[53:38] private key makes no sense um like
[53:41] you're you're asking to get wrecked
[53:43] you're literally sending a um what's the
[53:47] analogy it' be like driving to
[53:48] California without your seat belt like
[53:50] totally
[53:51] unsafe or it'd be like yeah I don't know
[53:53] maybe that's not the best example but
[53:55] the point is sending Bitcoin to
[53:58] addresses that you haven't verified not
[54:00] good this is irreversible it's digitally
[54:02] scarce people want it and they're coming
[54:04] for it so uh yeah in short huge fan of
[54:08] uh asymmetric key
[54:11] cryptography and and there's this
[54:14] interesting thing probably similar in
[54:17] America but in Austria there are a lot
[54:18] of towns named similar but they're in in
[54:22] different districts and sometimes it
[54:25] happened and happened to me like two
[54:27] three times already where I just quickly
[54:29] typed in the navigation system like the
[54:31] the name of the town like and just drove
[54:34] and then after a while it's like oh like
[54:37] am I am I right here and then I looked
[54:38] again I was like oh like I'm in a
[54:40] totally wrong direction because it
[54:42] didn't look close enough uh not only the
[54:45] name of the town because that was the
[54:46] same thing but also in what district is
[54:50] it and in what uh uh cter region is that
[54:54] and that's kind of maybe an analogy with
[54:56] with Bitcoin like you really have to
[54:58] make sure where is this money actually
[55:00] going and not just like quickly looking
[55:02] of like like there this address those
[55:06] free numbers seem to be similar and
[55:08] let's let's send a few thousand Euros in
[55:10] in in that direction with Bitcoin that
[55:13] seems to be highly irresponsible way to
[55:16] to deal with that yeah yeah good luck
[55:19] and you know I think this whole
[55:20] conversation is kind of like a sneak
[55:22] peek of like what's what's coming um for
[55:24] the industry and and hopefully the user
[55:26] you know know user the user use casee
[55:28] doesn't have to think about it too much
[55:29] but it is built in in some nice clever
[55:31] way I think that would be really good
[55:34] what what can we actually learn from the
[55:37] internet adoption and the learning curve
[55:39] that we have from the internet towards
[55:41] now the the Bitcoin adoption the Bitcoin
[55:44] ecosystem oh that's a good question um
[55:48] well look I mean I kind of already said
[55:49] like I I do think the internet was a
[55:51] mistake um yes free markets exist but
[55:54] like I do think the better timeline
[55:55] would have we build internet
[55:57] infrastructure and then layer Bitcoin on
[55:59] top nothing else like no consumer
[56:02] applications um I I made that up I have
[56:04] no sources what can we learn from the
[56:07] internet gosh I don't know I mean
[56:10] probably the only thing I can say is the
[56:11] internet wins like when has the internet
[56:13] ever
[56:14] lost like Twitter decimated the Arab
[56:17] Spring of
[56:19] 2011 you know okay Ross got put in
[56:21] prison for the Silk Road but did we
[56:24] lose I mean I wish he didn't go
[56:27] obviously but like we didn't we didn't
[56:29] go anywhere Bitcoin still won like it's
[56:32] it's like a Hydra with unlimited heads
[56:34] how are you g to kill it and it very
[56:36] much reflects nature in that way um like
[56:39] I I really like the analogy of Bitcoin
[56:41] as uh element zero no like what there's
[56:44] this analogy somebody wrote with like
[56:46] where Bitcoin has no atomic mass um but
[56:49] it's infinitely scarce and that's how
[56:51] you should think about it so yeah I mean
[56:54] it's it's a match made in heaven really
[56:55] I I think bet on the internet bet on
[56:58] bitcoin but uh you know go out there
[57:01] enjoy nature and enjoy your people I
[57:03] think that I think that's really the
[57:04] winning life
[57:06] philosophy I love that and uh one thing
[57:09] that I always ask people that build
[57:12] startups and build uh uh Tools in
[57:15] Bitcoin space um is the the question of
[57:18] like how is that how how are you
[57:20] building something in in in Bitcoin with
[57:23] the hurdle rate of Bitcoin with
[57:24] Investments with to to onboard people
[57:27] with trying to build something in the
[57:29] community yeah uh well look I mean it's
[57:33] hard to even put words to it like you
[57:34] almost just got to do it like that
[57:37] that's terrible advice but um there's so
[57:39] much I could say there's so much I could
[57:41] say um yeah it's hard I think any
[57:43] business is hard I think life's hard you
[57:45] have to pick your hard pick something
[57:47] that's worth it so what are you going to
[57:49] do go struggle in some Fiat mine and
[57:54] uh um you know work on somebody else's
[57:57] product that you don't like that you
[57:58] don't even believe in that's
[58:01] perpetuating Fiat slavery or you're
[58:04] going to struggle on the Bitcoin side
[58:06] but have actual spirit and heart in the
[58:09] game and you know probably have a lot
[58:12] better karmic response from the universe
[58:14] by doing something like that so you know
[58:17] like my whole my whole life philosophy
[58:19] is like you have to you have to you have
[58:21] to leave nothing on the table like my
[58:23] first triathlon uh my coach would yell
[58:25] out and he said said it's race day leave
[58:27] nothing on the like like spend it all
[58:29] but that's that's life he was actually
[58:31] talking about life you have to spend it
[58:32] all so if you're thinking about building
[58:33] Bitcoin yeah just do it it's super hard
[58:36] yeah investors uh
[58:38] investors they um they they want to come
[58:42] once you've already kind of proven
[58:43] yourself so it's easier if you've
[58:44] already done it it's easier if you
[58:45] already have
[58:47] money and that's about when you don't
[58:49] need it right so like when you need the
[58:51] money and when you haven't proven
[58:52] yourself you're probably not goingon to
[58:54] want to do much with you um I really
[58:58] enjoy talking to other builders um the
[59:01] spirit is very cool that's because I'm a
[59:02] builder right like birds of a feather
[59:04] flock together but it's tough you know
[59:05] you have to be perfect money is hard it
[59:07] has to be perfect there's no room for
[59:10] slop um Tech is hard ultimately this is
[59:13] All Tech right so I think what's more
[59:15] interesting this would be my actual
[59:17] answer is if you already work in another
[59:19] industry I would I would look more at
[59:21] infusing Bitcoin into that industry like
[59:24] Let It seep in let it creep in
[59:26] if you I'm just going to use medicine if
[59:28] you're in medicine figure out a way to
[59:30] get Bitcoin there there's some cool
[59:32] stuff already but if you're in real
[59:34] estate do the same like take Bitcoin and
[59:35] pull it into where you already are you
[59:38] don't need to you don't need to go be a
[59:40] Bitcoin core
[59:41] developer I I never really aspired to do
[59:44] that I mean I I look through the code
[59:45] base I follow it very closely um but I
[59:49] just didn't feel the pull I said look I
[59:51] want to look at this ux problem I want
[59:54] to look at this kind of human design so
[59:55] like look if maybe we'll use something
[59:57] more sexy like if you're an architect or
[59:59] a designer Infuse Bitcoin into your
[60:01] stuff you don't have to paint it orange
[60:04] but figure out how to put it into your
[60:05] financials like maybe accept Bitcoin as
[60:08] money and then use accounting on top of
[60:10] that and put your business on a Bitcoin
[60:12] standard like what better can you do if
[60:14] you in a small medium large business I
[60:16] think that's way better than trying to
[60:19] do a Bitcoin startup and that's also
[60:21] what I was talking about earlier when I
[60:23] said I didn't want to make a wallet I
[60:24] think making a wallet's a great
[60:26] educational purpose I'm just not
[60:28] interested in that because I feel like
[60:29] people have already done it so you know
[60:31] to each their own but those are some
[60:34] thoughts interesting I love that um
[60:37] that's that it's kind of amazing it's
[60:40] like pull pull that Bitcoin energy in in
[60:43] your
[60:44] company I like that also it's it's yeah
[60:47] I I know know some people that do that
[60:49] that I in companies and they are the
[60:51] bitcoiners they even give like small uh
[60:54] presentations in front of like 30 50 60
[60:57] people inside of the company and say
[61:00] like hey like if if you're interested at
[61:02] 600 700 p.m. in the evening after work
[61:04] I'm giving a small Bitcoin presentation
[61:05] and you can listen to that like there
[61:07] are so much things you you can do in
[61:09] your company to get Bitcoin in there you
[61:13] infiltrate Bitcoin in there and that's
[61:16] that's an amazing thing if if you are
[61:17] happy with with the current job and with
[61:20] the current industry you're in uh like
[61:22] uh you you don't need to to change any
[61:25] anything and you can build Bitcoin
[61:27] within there in whatever capacity if
[61:30] you're just like small orange building
[61:32] two three colleagues of yours that's
[61:34] already amazing like you're doing God's
[61:36] work with with that uh and that's that's
[61:38] kind of yeah that's really cool um I
[61:41] have one question that I ask each and
[61:42] every one of my guests and the question
[61:43] is what can we learn from you besides
[61:47] Bitcoin oh man I'm not prepared for that
[61:50] all I do is work on
[61:52] bitcoin um no I would say remember death
[61:55] moment toori man like it's like
[61:57] seriously I'm I'm built this way but um
[62:00] maybe something unique is I think about
[62:01] death uh probably three four times a
[62:03] week just throughout the day in the
[62:05] morning and it's like okay time to go
[62:09] there's no time to wait it's time to go
[62:11] now um that's real that's real I think
[62:14] you know wake yourself up like the whole
[62:16] point of Bitcoin is see truth see
[62:19] reality um it's this is not time to be
[62:22] asleep this is time to attack you're
[62:24] alive you're breathing air we like we
[62:26] think we're breathing
[62:28] air um so you know that That's My
[62:32] Philosophy is like go don't wait don't
[62:34] wait at all like life is short um but
[62:37] you like vividly remembering death for
[62:39] me is something that uh I don't know
[62:42] maybe it's a fear exercise some people
[62:43] are probably built this way I think for
[62:45] some people it's not good I do that but
[62:47] it also forces me to basically compress
[62:49] the timeline so I love the phrase of
[62:52] everything I do I want to compress the
[62:54] timeline I don't want to sacrif quality
[62:56] but I want to compress my timeline I
[62:58] think what a lot of people do is they
[63:00] assume they have more time than they do
[63:02] oh I'm going to start a company then oh
[63:04] I'm going to quit my Fiat job oh I'm G
[63:06] to run an Iron Man whatever look I mean
[63:08] I hadn't been in the dojo uh for
[63:10] jiujitsu in like a year um I I went back
[63:14] I actually signed up for a a tournament
[63:17] uh and then I I had to go back and train
[63:19] right um you know my daughter's growing
[63:21] up here I want her to see Dad finish an
[63:23] Iron Man I haven't done one in a little
[63:24] while half Iron Man man just signed up
[63:27] I'm not even training it but it'll
[63:28] happen you want to start a company just
[63:30] do it what's the worst that get that
[63:31] happens maybe the worst that happens is
[63:34] you get thrown in prison for like a
[63:35] decade that's pretty bad like Ross think
[63:38] God is's out I don't know man those are
[63:40] just some
[63:41] thoughts yeah that's the Ross kind of
[63:44] imposes the worst case scenario and even
[63:47] Dan it's uh he he comes now to a happy
[63:51] end and uh that's that's kind of like
[63:54] still a good still a good story like he
[63:56] has an interesting story to
[63:58] tell collecting interesting stories is
[64:01] kind of like life's mission in in a
[64:04] sense it's like if you collect more
[64:06] interesting stories uh it's it's that
[64:09] that's what what life is all about if
[64:12] you if your grandkids ask you all like
[64:14] what what did you do with your life uh
[64:17] you should better have some interesting
[64:18] stories and Ross
[64:20] definitely interesting stories for tell
[64:22] I love that man that's so true
[64:26] yeah really cool um we have one uh end
[64:28] routine in the podcast where the
[64:29] previous guest is asking a question for
[64:31] the next guest without knowing who the
[64:33] next guest actually is and the question
[64:35] for from the previous guest for you is
[64:37] what is the last substantial topic you
[64:40] have changed your mind on H oh that's
[64:43] not PC that's not PC that's not PC yeah
[64:48] yeah you know um one thing that I'll say
[64:50] briefly because I can't be fake man is
[64:53] astrology I think astrolog is really
[64:55] interesting
[64:56] I think when you nice yeah I mean look
[64:59] uh perceptions aside same like Bitcoin
[65:02] but it's one of those things where once
[65:03] you see it you can't unsee it I think
[65:05] you think about the three wise men who
[65:06] are astrologers I think you look at the
[65:08] patterns with a very open mind um the
[65:11] language is different to Gro like I
[65:13] speak English so understanding certain
[65:15] Frameworks in certain languages are
[65:17] tough right like English is not the most
[65:19] romantic language English is not the
[65:22] most um dense language compared to I
[65:25] don't know German Japanese Turkish it's
[65:27] not phonetic right so languages have
[65:29] these properties English isn't that
[65:31] great at describing astrology right now
[65:33] um that being said like I've always
[65:35] loved physics and um I think that's a
[65:38] whole other Frontier I think with big
[65:40] data uh there's some cool platforms I
[65:42] think astroarts is one of them um I
[65:45] actually need to reach out back to these
[65:47] guys but I think when you a when you can
[65:49] aggregate large data and when you can
[65:51] look at patterns Um this can get
[65:54] distilled into a philosophy
[65:56] I think Twitter does that in real time
[65:58] with news I think that's why Bitcoin is
[66:01] so popular I think that's why certain
[66:02] political movements are so popular I
[66:05] think with something like astrology um
[66:08] you know big data is going to crack that
[66:09] open and it's going to be super obvious
[66:11] and there's no profit in that
[66:14] necessarily it's kind of an
[66:15] Enlightenment sort of topic like you're
[66:18] not going to necessarily build a
[66:19] business or something technical out of
[66:21] astrology but I think once uh we look at
[66:25] that with a wider
[66:27] lens um a lot is going to come out of
[66:29] that and I think it's going to be very
[66:30] eye openening so that's something I've
[66:32] I've been really interested in lately
[66:34] and I think that's pretty Off the Wall I
[66:35] don't talk about it too often but I'll
[66:37] give you that I love that that that's
[66:40] why that's why have those those
[66:42] questions in to get something else also
[66:44] out there really cool thank you so much
