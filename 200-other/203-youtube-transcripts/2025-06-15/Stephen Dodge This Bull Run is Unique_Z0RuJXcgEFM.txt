[00:00] what is it going to take for a company
[00:01] like Dell to truly adopt a Bitcoin
[00:04] standard do you have a price prediction
[00:06] a couple people that have been like 288k
[00:07] and like the next cycle so I'm like
[00:08] that's that's a number I agree with and
[00:10] would like to see the point of the
[00:11] tappered asset protocol is to
[00:12] essentially bring Bitcoin back into the
[00:14] you rview and say hey like we can do
[00:16] this on bitcoin we're really going after
[00:18] the business and kind of Enterprise
[00:19] adoption of how do we really start
[00:21] getting businesses to use Bitcoin cbdcs
[00:23] are coming I'm like it's basically that
[00:25] already I was like they can stop your
[00:26] bank account they print it whenever they
[00:28] want it's already digital we already
[00:30] have basically cbdcs whether people like
[00:31] to kind of admit it or not custodial
[00:33] lightning is really really really easy
[00:35] but that's not true lightning in a sense
[00:36] if we want Bitcoin to be like the
[00:38] financial asset of the world like you're
[00:39] going to have a lot of financial
[00:40] products being built on it it would be
[00:41] so good that people are like I don't
[00:43] want that and they'll just run to the
[00:44] Bitcoin standard so it's like I'm opting
[00:46] out of
[00:49] that and do you expect a major buun this
[00:52] this year is there something on your on
[00:54] your
[00:55] mind yeah I mean I think you know this B
[00:59] this cycle is you know going to be
[01:00] unique in my mind um you know this is my
[01:02] third um so you know preparing
[01:04] accordingly and we know we still have a
[01:06] couple more probably months until you
[01:07] really start to see kind of the
[01:08] fireworks you know I imagine sometime
[01:11] around like the U you know the US
[01:12] election but um yeah I just think you
[01:14] have so many different things kind of
[01:16] blending together you know you've got
[01:18] the obviously the ETFs um you know
[01:20] you'll have a little bit more of like
[01:21] the minor kind of capitulation and sell
[01:23] off a bit um just I think more awareness
[01:26] and demand coming through you know just
[01:28] more and more people every day you know
[01:30] DCA or just buying businesses people on
[01:33] boarding you name it um obviously
[01:35] politically now you know no no matter
[01:37] what you're kind of leaning is you know
[01:38] that's become front and center um crypto
[01:41] broadly has so you know that's going to
[01:42] be another kind of driving factor I see
[01:44] and then um yeah you know generally it's
[01:46] like six seven months after the having
[01:48] that you really start to see some
[01:50] movement um and then yeah I think the
[01:52] election itself will have a little bit
[01:54] of an outcome or influence on the
[01:55] outcome of really how much we move but
[01:58] uh yeah excited for it
[02:00] yeah I think they having this there some
[02:02] had someone that's did some St like I'm
[02:04] totally uninterested in in price charts
[02:07] anything like that but it's always fun s
[02:10] yeah one that is one s but I mean the
[02:13] price is still important I feel like
[02:15] when you when you have uh especially for
[02:17] people that are not deep in Bitcoin and
[02:19] not have done the research like
[02:20] thousands of hours of podcast listenings
[02:23] and stuff like that um they really care
[02:25] about the price and they really look
[02:28] forward to like oh what what what could
[02:30] the price be I mean my thing is like
[02:32] they always probably think like where
[02:35] can Bitcoin go like they they try to
[02:37] figure out the total addressable of
[02:39] market for Bitcoin and that's why I
[02:41] think like price predictions actually
[02:43] serve a purpose and actually are
[02:45] something positive for Bitcoin I
[02:47] completely changed my opinion on that I
[02:48] was like one year ago I was completely
[02:50] different and I was like oh no no no I
[02:52] see it I put when I put a price tag in a
[02:57] thumbnail I know there will be more new
[03:00] people in and there are also more new
[03:02] big questions in there so this has some
[03:05] effects actually and I feel like that's
[03:07] a an
[03:08] underrated um marketing tool oh
[03:12] absolutely I mean we can be honest you
[03:15] know it's like most people are when they
[03:16] hear Bitcoin you know they're just going
[03:18] to think price immediately you know the
[03:20] mass the masses um and you know it is
[03:23] important you know like to be frank like
[03:25] the world still runs on Fiat the dollar
[03:28] and that's what people price things in
[03:30] um you know I think eventually we'll
[03:31] obviously you know hopefully transition
[03:33] to the Bitcoin you know standard if you
[03:35] will but uh yeah that's what people care
[03:36] about especially when you know at least
[03:38] in my time my lifetime and a lot of
[03:40] people um you know I would say to date
[03:44] like they just haven't really had like a
[03:45] way to save or like really get ahead um
[03:49] you know like with rates at zero for so
[03:51] long you know like when you had a
[03:52] checking or a savings account like you
[03:53] weren't earning that much you know lot
[03:55] not when the the last Generations were
[03:56] doing um so the really the only way you
[03:59] could you know really get ahead was kind
[04:01] of put money in some stocks and that's
[04:03] if you had enough you know to really see
[04:05] some of the gains and the appreciation
[04:06] but um or something like you know
[04:08] Bitcoin so it's like if you're putting
[04:09] your money in Bitcoin and you've seen
[04:11] the past you know gains and you know the
[04:13] way it does its you know typical Cycles
[04:15] um yeah you're going to probably care
[04:16] about the price if dollars at the end of
[04:19] the day is kind of what you're spending
[04:20] um and we see that you know even
[04:22] globally still you know even with
[04:23] Bitcoin being used uh you know as a kind
[04:26] of you know not just want to store value
[04:29] but also like the unit of um account for
[04:31] when people uh you know use the
[04:33] lightning Network you know and then kind
[04:34] of uh you know swap out to like their
[04:36] local currency it shows that like yes
[04:38] they have value for Bitcoin the network
[04:40] and transferring value over it but they
[04:42] still want to use you know dollar
[04:44] denominated assets or some type of you
[04:46] know fiat currency so I think people
[04:48] will care about it still for quite some
[04:49] time especially if they're looking for
[04:50] the
[04:51] gains absolutely and it's interesting
[04:54] because when we had the internet
[04:55] Revolution or like the internet coming
[04:57] up in like the 1990s early 2000s um
[05:02] there was no token under underlying
[05:04] everything like there was of course a
[05:06] Facebook stock there was a Apple stock
[05:08] and all that stuff that they really
[05:09] benefit from it and it's kind of the
[05:11] internet token but Bitcoin has the
[05:13] network where you can use it but it also
[05:15] has the token and that's why like how
[05:19] how crazy would it be if the internet
[05:20] had a token and you could see like in
[05:22] real life the the the signal what what
[05:24] the internet is going so like that's
[05:26] kind of Bitcoin like you can invest in
[05:28] the whole internet and that's that's
[05:31] the that comparison usually makes it
[05:34] interesting for for people that come
[05:37] from the internet World understand that
[05:39] the network effects uh and uh they don't
[05:42] really get like what Bitcoin is and
[05:44] they're like oh no it's not it's not
[05:45] Facebook stock it's like buying a a part
[05:48] of of the Internet Protocol like that's
[05:51] that's basically how I dis describe uh
[05:53] Bitcoin always and when you look at now
[05:55] at uh that cycle and uh I wanted to
[05:58] start off with a different question but
[06:00] kind of developed in dead like um do you
[06:02] have uh price prediction do you have
[06:04] some some goal in mind what what the
[06:06] current pull run is obviously
[06:07] predictions are um always wrong and some
[06:11] are useful but but it's like do do you
[06:14] have some model of framework how you
[06:16] think about that um I mean I honestly
[06:19] always just you know the price is
[06:21] obviously so unpredictable um to a
[06:23] degree uh you just I've seen so many
[06:26] people be like oh you know I got in at
[06:27] the top or you know they never want to
[06:29] get you know we see memes all the time
[06:30] like they never want to buy you know
[06:31] when it's down to 55 but they want to
[06:34] you know not or you know then why didn't
[06:37] I buy when it's back up to 72 you know
[06:39] th000 or whatever it is um so I think
[06:41] yeah for Price predictions I mean I
[06:42] always love the 288 Kate number I think
[06:44] um will woo puts it out or somebody
[06:46] there's like a couple people that have
[06:47] been like 288k in like the next cycle so
[06:49] I'm like that's that's a number I agree
[06:50] with and would like to see um yeah I
[06:53] mean I think I would say at least over
[06:55] you know 100K um is you know at least my
[06:59] base line predictions um but yeah I
[07:01] think it could go you know much much
[07:03] higher um and I think just even whether
[07:05] you like it or not uh you know some of
[07:07] the stuff that's being built on bitcoin
[07:09] with all these you know ordinals and
[07:11] brc2 runes tappered assets all these
[07:15] different things um just as there's more
[07:17] and more demand for Bitcoin the asset um
[07:20] yeah you're just going to see increase
[07:21] you know I think price action over time
[07:23] um given us permissionless and people
[07:25] are going to use it however they want
[07:28] that's perfect and then this is uh gives
[07:30] a gives us a perfect uh uh guide now in
[07:33] the next topic about tap rot assets and
[07:35] all that things um for people don't know
[07:38] they don't know what tap assets runes
[07:40] and and all the things that you just
[07:42] mentioned are like what what is that and
[07:44] and and why do we we need those
[07:47] things yeah so I mean there's obviously
[07:49] like a you know a lot of different
[07:51] protocols and you know meta you know
[07:54] protocols that have been coming out in
[07:56] the last you know year or two um I think
[07:58] ordinals is probably the you know first
[08:00] one that people probably really really
[08:01] heard of um but there's some obviously
[08:03] older historical ones like people have
[08:04] been doing this you know since bitcoin's
[08:06] Inception um but yeah taped assets
[08:09] specifically which is what our my
[08:10] company joltz focuses on um is a
[08:13] protocol that was you know uh developed
[08:15] by lightning Labs I think they announced
[08:17] it maybe a little over two years ago um
[08:20] but yeah in large part they raised about
[08:21] $70 million um in large part to to build
[08:24] that protocol out um and it's really
[08:26] meant to make you know Bitcoin and you
[08:29] know mostly the lightning network is
[08:30] where the value is for this protocol but
[08:32] it's meant to make it like a multi-asset
[08:34] network um you know and what what does
[08:36] that mean I think the biggest use case
[08:39] that people point to for tapered assets
[08:40] is you know stable coins um on Lightning
[08:43] that's stable coins where you know it's
[08:45] it's actually really crazy data point um
[08:47] kind of something that we've seen over
[08:49] the last couple years but like it is
[08:50] like the use case on all blockchains
[08:53] like it is the unit of account
[08:54] settlement like it just has taken over
[08:56] it's not ethereum it's not like the
[08:58] native tokens anymore it's just stable
[09:00] coins um which is again really
[09:02] interesting seeing that demand but the
[09:03] point of taer the tappered asset
[09:05] protocol is to essentially bring Bitcoin
[09:07] back into the you know purview and say
[09:09] hey like we can do this on bitcoin you
[09:11] know it originally started there um back
[09:13] with like Omni Omni layer I think um I
[09:16] don't know how many years ago that was
[09:17] but uh that's really the goal with you
[09:19] know taper asset protocol is how can we
[09:21] do this on bitcoin but do it at scale
[09:24] and do it in a way to where it's not you
[09:26] know basically filling up you know the
[09:27] mol or blocks with a bunch of data uh
[09:31] where you can do this in a way where the
[09:33] the required data there is some
[09:34] obviously some onchain footprint but
[09:36] it's you know drastically less than what
[09:38] ordinals brc2 runes and all these other
[09:41] things are doing um and it's just more
[09:43] efficient um and I think the really
[09:44] really cool thing is that tapered assets
[09:46] wallet you know started or the first
[09:48] major release was the onchain component
[09:50] which I think was like October or
[09:52] November of last year um but now we've
[09:55] got the uh upcoming which should be in
[09:58] the next week or so is the actual first
[09:59] major release of taped asset channels
[10:02] which will allow taped assets to
[10:04] actually you know again go go across and
[10:07] you know be custody swap Traverse
[10:09] transfer pay you know XYZ we basically
[10:11] flow over uh the lightning Network um
[10:14] now really it in my mind for the
[10:16] lightning Network itself and tapered
[10:18] assets uh you know fbl are really the
[10:20] only thing that can go across you know
[10:22] like the tokens if you will um you can't
[10:24] really do like Collectibles over over um
[10:26] over lightning but you still do have the
[10:28] onchain component of tapered assets that
[10:30] works uh both on chain and and uh on
[10:32] lightning and there's a yeah just a lot
[10:33] of really cool stuff too just at the
[10:35] protocol level um that it enables not
[10:37] just uh you know if you kind of put
[10:39] aside the assets that can be created
[10:41] there is just some actual um technical
[10:43] benefits to helping scaling lightning
[10:45] and um just common day transactions too
[10:48] but uh there's a lot of really cool
[10:49] stuff coming out and we're actually
[10:50] supporting several businesses and
[10:52] partners right now that want to build um
[10:54] and you know we're building for on the
[10:56] tappered asset uh
[10:58] protocol do you think that at some point
[11:02] everything uh can or will be built on
[11:05] top of Bitcoin I don't know if it'll be
[11:06] everything but I think you'll see like a
[11:09] vast again whether people like it or not
[11:11] it's like all the stuff with ordinals
[11:14] and runes and brc2 I mean you saw a lot
[11:16] of developers and obviously a ton of
[11:19] capital you know uh like investment but
[11:21] also just people spending their money or
[11:22] spending their Bitcoin um just flow onto
[11:25] Bitcoin because you could finally do
[11:26] this on bitcoin so like the build on
[11:27] bitcoin kind of thesis and
[11:29] um you know just is just proving to play
[11:32] out that people want to do this on the
[11:33] most you know decentralized uh network
[11:36] but it's one that you know is seen as
[11:38] you know pristine or secure um it's just
[11:40] kind of this Granite Foundation versus
[11:42] the others you know that we all know and
[11:44] you know we probably rinse and repe and
[11:46] say it but you know they're just
[11:47] different protocols different rules um
[11:50] not not decentralized people can kind of
[11:52] change them you know XYZ um but I think
[11:55] um I think the really cool one would be
[11:57] definitely you know stable coins on
[11:59] lightning that's where we're kind of you
[12:01] know placing our bet in most of our
[12:03] focus with our with our SDK and swapping
[12:05] service just because there's there's
[12:06] going to be needed uh tooling um and
[12:09] infrastructure basically for kind of two
[12:12] phases I see it as like you need the
[12:13] tooling and the infrastructure for you
[12:15] know any type of stable coin or payments
[12:18] you know system to really ride on
[12:20] lightning um and to bring that liquidity
[12:22] in um and really start expanding the
[12:24] network um which you know should happen
[12:26] innately um as more you know stable
[12:28] stable Co providers come on to the
[12:30] lightning Network um and the way the
[12:32] lightning Labs did it I think was it was
[12:33] pretty clever um but then for I think
[12:36] like if you want Bitcoin lightning is
[12:38] like these kind of bottom layers and
[12:40] then you know you have whatever the Fiat
[12:43] backed stable coin or whatever the you
[12:44] know asset is um that still rides on
[12:47] Lightning uses Bitcoin as the you know
[12:50] underlying um kind of you know asset or
[12:52] unit of account still under the hood um
[12:54] for Enterprises or just like really
[12:56] really broadscale adoption you know I'm
[12:58] thinking like big businesses you know
[13:00] like Michael Dell you know is tweeting
[13:02] about Bitcoin you know lately it's like
[13:04] what is it going to take for you know a
[13:07] company like Dell to truly adopt a
[13:10] Bitcoin standard like even micro
[13:11] strategy to date is like great what
[13:13] they've done they're you know buying it
[13:14] and holding it but like what is it going
[13:16] to take to move or kind of take that
[13:18] next step of getting like real
[13:20] mainstream adoption of using the Bitcoin
[13:22] Network and again Bitcoin the asset is
[13:25] the kind of uh really like getting
[13:26] mainstream adoption of people using it
[13:28] day-to-day cuz I just just think some
[13:29] people are still too hesitant to take
[13:31] the full leap of you know just using
[13:33] Bitcoin in their day-to-day and we've
[13:35] seen that and that's why like people
[13:37] aren't even using other tokens as their
[13:38] day-to-day they're using stable coins
[13:40] but you know they appreciate the network
[13:42] they appreciate the you know being able
[13:44] to do things you know on on ethereum and
[13:46] Tron and all these other things but
[13:47] they're still using stable coin so I
[13:49] think that's what you kind of need for
[13:50] the real next big runup and for
[13:52] mainstream adoption um yeah globally for
[13:55] you know Enterprise day-to-day business
[13:57] dealings settlement things like that
[13:59] it's interesting for me when when we
[14:01] look at all the different use cases I me
[14:03] like the biggest uh benefit you
[14:07] personally I feel like you have with
[14:09] Bitcoin when you just like buy it hold
[14:11] it don't touch it like that that that's
[14:13] kind of like way where you have the
[14:15] least uh risk of like losing it where
[14:18] you have just the like the the further
[14:21] way it's from you of the sell button
[14:23] further ways from you from just using it
[14:25] transacting it it's it was historically
[14:28] the the best
[14:29] and it's also for me like interesting
[14:31] because I have a a pretty sophisticated
[14:34] setup where it's not even that easy for
[14:37] me uh to spend it like I have to drive
[14:39] to different locations and stuff like
[14:41] that so like it's it's it's it's pretty
[14:43] wild the security measurements that that
[14:46] I took for for my personal setup but um
[14:49] the interesting part here is like it's
[14:52] it's not done with a click of a button
[14:54] like like I have to really move and in
[14:57] the physical world and do something to
[14:59] move my Bitcoin my my main stack of
[15:01] course but outside of that like when
[15:04] it's in the lightning wallet or
[15:06] something like that it's like g a really
[15:08] easy to handle like something like a
[15:10] wallet of satos something like you just
[15:11] like click a button tck it's there um
[15:15] it's it's way more like it goes away
[15:19] quicker um so it's it's it's interesting
[15:22] how people now use it like guess it's
[15:23] the store of Val the safe haven and I'm
[15:26] interested in interested in like how
[15:29] this will go and like bit people
[15:32] actually using their Bitcoin for other
[15:33] things and the transactions also when
[15:35] they they get a little bit more uh
[15:37] expensive right now they're on a a lower
[15:39] end but if they get more expensive again
[15:42] um if they are doing all those those
[15:44] things on top of Bitcoin that's why
[15:46] lightning I feel like is is important
[15:47] how do you see that uh in general like
[15:50] Bitcoin scaling with lightning with like
[15:52] fent with all the all those different
[15:55] protocols that are going on yeah um I
[15:57] mean I think like you know eash F and
[15:59] all these other things are you know all
[16:01] interesting I think there's going to be
[16:02] a lot of different plays on what an L2
[16:05] and how to scale or just leverage
[16:07] lightning you know I've I think I've
[16:09] heard it more recently you know just
[16:10] like lightning is still going to be kind
[16:11] of this interconnective tissue for all
[16:14] these different kind of ways of
[16:15] leveraging lightning in Bitcoin you know
[16:17] whether it's um you know some type of
[16:19] side chain whether it's you know ecash
[16:21] whether it's taer assets on Lightning
[16:22] you know you name it um but I do think
[16:25] you know tappered assets does again have
[16:27] some of these benefits that you know
[16:29] help for those types of um you know
[16:31] higher onchain fee pressure you know
[16:33] they've got a couple Concepts where it's
[16:35] like give v utxos um again Tapper asset
[16:39] the actual like transactions just have
[16:41] much less footprint than typical
[16:43] transaction other benefits like privacy
[16:45] things like that um but from our like
[16:47] from our wallet SDK and our swapping
[16:49] service like that is kind of what our in
[16:52] goal and Mission is is to make you know
[16:54] we we've already got like you said your
[16:56] kind of cold storage or savings account
[16:57] like you have your you know little Nest
[17:00] that you're never going to touch you're
[17:01] just going to keep stacking keep it over
[17:02] there but for your kind of day-to-day
[17:04] life um or just you know whatever that
[17:07] amount of money you need to you know
[17:09] again transact or just do things with
[17:10] every day from day to day um that's
[17:13] where we see lightning and especially
[17:14] tapered assets kind of shining because
[17:16] again you like in our ux for example
[17:19] like we see like you probably won't
[17:21] store your I mean maybe like we building
[17:23] towards that but you probably wouldn't
[17:24] store like your you know big savings
[17:27] account on there it's more for like your
[17:28] day-to-day
[17:29] um day-to-day spending so you'll have
[17:31] you know a Bitcoin balance um you know a
[17:34] amount uh that is stored in you know
[17:37] just Bitcoin or and then you'll have
[17:38] your kind of like what we imagine is
[17:40] like your local uh Fiat amount which is
[17:43] like a you know USD us usdt you know
[17:46] stable coin or some local stable coin
[17:48] that you have that you can spend you
[17:49] know at Merchants um peer-to-peer
[17:51] whatever it may be um and you can just
[17:54] quickly and easily and swap in between
[17:56] those when whenever you need to so you
[17:58] know whatever you know maybe you just
[18:00] got paid um you know 50% goes to your
[18:03] savings the other 50 is meant for dayto
[18:04] day you can still keep you know of that
[18:06] 50 50% maybe it's 30% still kept in
[18:10] Bitcoin and your you know jolts wallet
[18:12] SDK powering another wallet um and then
[18:15] the other 20% is you know the local you
[18:17] know stable coin or um fiat currency and
[18:20] then you can use that to you know easily
[18:21] spend it without having to worry about
[18:23] the price fluctuations you know of
[18:24] Bitcoin compared to you know your local
[18:27] currency um and also if versa like we're
[18:29] like we're really going after the the
[18:32] you know I'll say business and kind of
[18:34] Enterprise adoption of how do we really
[18:36] start getting businesses to use Bitcoin
[18:38] to like you know not just either keep it
[18:41] on their balance sheet or you know use
[18:42] it as a you know some type of Treasury
[18:43] asset but like how do we really get them
[18:45] to start moving the needle of pushing
[18:47] Bitcoin through you know day-to-day
[18:48] whether it's business to business um you
[18:51] know Financial transactions or whether
[18:52] it's their end consumer customer um
[18:55] transactions as well but uh yeah like
[18:57] even in our in our wallet DK um for
[19:00] lightning like we're trying to make the
[19:01] ux so simple um you know we don't even
[19:04] have uh what we would we're kind of
[19:06] doing a hybrid system I'll say um where
[19:08] you don't even have to do Channel
[19:10] management um so we're just kind of
[19:11] doing these trustless swaps at the end
[19:14] uh to where if you know if you need your
[19:16] certain amount of SATs or if you need a
[19:18] certain amount of um whatever the stable
[19:20] coin or token is um that you will
[19:22] basically just handle that uh trustless
[19:25] between our node or any other node that
[19:26] would be running kind of the the
[19:27] swapping service
[19:29] um so basically you don't have to deal
[19:30] with you know any type of Channel
[19:32] management because kind of to your point
[19:34] it was like lightning custodial
[19:37] lightning is really really really easy
[19:38] but that's not I would say like true
[19:40] lightning in a sense um so we've think
[19:43] we've come up with a pretty novel
[19:44] approach um to basically provide the
[19:47] custodial type ux um but not have it be
[19:50] custodial fully non-custodial
[19:52] trustless and being able to enjoy the
[19:54] benefits of you know the lightning
[19:56] Network um and the speed and low cost of
[19:58] it if you watch or listen to my podcast
[20:00] on a regular basis I'll guess you
[20:02] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[20:05] most important step is to keep the
[20:08] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[20:10] wallet my personal recommendation for
[20:12] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[20:15] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[20:18] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[20:20] their Bitcoin on an exchange and you can

[20:59] maybe might be improvable or your
[21:01] digital footprint in general is secure
[21:04] they are the experts in cyber security
[21:07] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[21:10] secure sovereign individual in general
[21:13] and for those of you who are in search
[21:15] of a new Bitcoin exchange where they can
[21:17] buy their Bitcoin from I recommend my
[21:20] personal Bitcoin exchange 21 Bitcoin
[21:23] with code Robin you get a hefty discount
[21:26] for all your purchases in the future
[21:29] there's a there's always like one
[21:30] question coming up in my mind when we
[21:32] talk about uh Bitcoin outside of the
[21:35] real um like when we talk about T and
[21:39] other things like there's like this main
[21:42] use case of Bitcoin right now a store
[21:44] value and there's like maybe it get me
[21:46] exchange then we have like the ordinals
[21:48] the nfts the tap r assets all the things
[21:50] on top of Bitcoin um I I'm always a
[21:54] believer that like no no matter what you
[21:56] do in Bitcoin it is good for Bitcoin
[21:59] um so I don't see it as a threat I don't
[22:01] see it I don't even see it as a
[22:03] distraction uh because I think the the
[22:05] people that are coming in uh for like n
[22:08] nfts on on top of Bitcoin they probably
[22:10] would not be in Bitcoin anyways if there
[22:12] would not be any nfts in Bitcoin they
[22:15] would be on inferium or something like
[22:16] that actually a good thing um to have
[22:19] them in in our ecosystem um but do you
[22:23] see any any threats or any any
[22:25] distractions when when we talk about uh
[22:28] those those things or is it like all all
[22:30] good for for Bitcoin or could there be
[22:33] some some some threat that you come
[22:35] could think about um I don't know if I
[22:37] consider like a threat I mean obviously
[22:38] I think there'll be you know rug pools
[22:41] or projects that still scam people or
[22:43] you know again like people do this
[22:46] already dayto day you know it's like
[22:48] people go to Vegas and just gamble money
[22:50] people gamble money on you know sports
[22:52] betting you know FanDuel and all that
[22:54] stuff like people are willing to take
[22:55] their money and spend it on things that
[22:57] they think well appreciating price or
[22:59] just again just what are the odds that I
[23:01] you know win um and come out higher than
[23:03] I whatever I put in um and I think you
[23:06] know that people do have real demand for
[23:08] things of like Collectibles and art and
[23:09] I mean there is some interesting I think
[23:11] there's some interesting things out
[23:12] there um whether you agree with like
[23:14] ordinals or not I mean I think it is
[23:16] like pretty interesting that you can you
[23:18] know store something on the Bitcoin
[23:21] blockchain which we all know and
[23:22] perceive as like going to be like the
[23:24] most permanent secure you know storage
[23:27] layer you know if not that like I think
[23:30] that's its purpose um but it is like an
[23:32] interesting capability now um you may've
[23:35] been been able to do it for a while but
[23:37] it's like that is just uh you know
[23:38] making that easier is is is really
[23:40] interesting um again use cases right now
[23:43] seem to be a little more speculative but
[23:46] um yeah I could definitely see where
[23:48] something like that is valuable one day
[23:49] or it comes in a form factor that's
[23:52] maybe not so uh you know damaging maybe
[23:55] to like the on on chain footprint um but
[23:58] yeah I think experimenting and building
[24:00] is is always good it's it's always
[24:02] interesting I mean I still think
[24:04] tappered assets and and the tappered
[24:05] asset protocol is like the best way to
[24:07] do these types of things um I mean we're
[24:09] seeing like we support a lot of
[24:11] different use cases um like we're we
[24:13] have a couple partners that we're
[24:14] working with that are doing things for
[24:16] like loyalty and rewards and incentives
[24:18] um and this is actually kind of the
[24:20] reason we started going down this
[24:22] journey on tapered assets because we
[24:23] started as a a rewards and incentives
[24:25] company and kind of once I got out of
[24:28] like the Bitcoin space like a lot of our
[24:30] early partners and customers were
[24:33] Bitcoin companies um but once we started
[24:35] talking to more like traditional
[24:36] companies you know your web 2 or just
[24:38] you know the Nikes the Nordstrom
[24:40] Starbucks of the world if you will um
[24:42] you know it was just like too a little
[24:43] too much of a leap to start doing like
[24:45] Bitcoin rewards um and so we're like how
[24:48] can we make Bitcoin you know it's
[24:51] obviously still attractive but how can
[24:53] we make it a little more um you know
[24:55] just common and something that people
[24:57] are used to
[24:59] um in like their typical points or
[25:00] loyalty system and and we were like well
[25:03] can we do something like Bitcoin back
[25:04] points um where it's like you know to
[25:06] the end user or customer member whatever
[25:08] it is it looks like a common point that
[25:10] they're earning you know most people are
[25:11] part of some Rewards program um but you
[25:14] know these points or uh you know rewards
[25:16] that you get actually increase in value
[25:18] you know over time as Bitcoin goes up um
[25:21] and it's just something that again is a
[25:23] little more digestible and you know
[25:25] something that's not as far as a reach
[25:27] um and so that's kind of why we started
[25:28] going down this journey and you know
[25:30] that's a use case that you know I don't
[25:32] think is harmful to bitcoin it's another
[25:34] use case that has Real World um
[25:36] implications but it's also something
[25:38] that obviously people find valuable you
[25:40] know the global loyalty Market is
[25:41] massive um so I think like there's just
[25:43] like a lot of different interesting use
[25:45] cases that can be uh built on bitcoin
[25:48] it's just you know will it always be
[25:49] done right the first time no um but you
[25:52] know there's going to be always
[25:53] iterations and people trying to build
[25:55] things better so you I think in time
[25:57] things will work out out and we have a
[25:59] lot of interesting things and that's
[26:01] yeah I mean if we want Bitcoin to be
[26:02] like the financial asset of the world
[26:04] like you're going to have a lot of
[26:05] financial products being built on it so
[26:08] that tooling and those Services products
[26:10] platforms you name it like they're going
[26:12] to be built um One Way or Another and
[26:14] yeah they're not I don't think we're
[26:15] ever going to get it right the first
[26:16] time and there's always trade-offs but
[26:17] um yeah I'm always excited to see what's
[26:19] being built as long as it's you know
[26:21] with good intentions and hopefully has
[26:23] the best tech stack and you know way of
[26:25] delivering
[26:26] it i i l that a lot because like the we
[26:30] need to build this this common Financial
[26:32] fear system kind of in in Bitcoin uh
[26:36] it's still a question to me like if if
[26:38] if we actually get rid of the feeld
[26:39] system the longer I like the first I
[26:42] came in Bitcoin there was no question in
[26:44] my mind that F this will ever go away I
[26:46] thought like it will always speed then I
[26:49] got into Bitcoin got more and more like
[26:51] oh yeah of course fat will go away then
[26:53] I'm like oh but the the network effects
[26:56] and and the power of feat is really big
[26:59] like from from the governments and from
[27:00] the thing it's it's like I'm I'm right
[27:03] now like writing articles on that and
[27:05] researching on that and and I'm thinking
[27:07] really hard about like will this
[27:10] actually happen this this this Bitcoin
[27:12] standard Revolution with like there's
[27:15] medium of exchange and unit of account
[27:16] in the Bitcoin world and there is no
[27:19] more fear or like there's less and less
[27:22] feeld like more and more counts actually
[27:24] just on a Bitcoin standard um do do you
[27:26] think that that this will happen on uh
[27:30] and this can happen in for example my
[27:32] lifetime I'm like 25 let's assume I live
[27:35] another 70 years I mean our lifetime I
[27:37] think it could be interesting I mean
[27:40] given kind of where a lot of the you
[27:41] know Global currencies are at right now
[27:43] and their lifetime you know so most of
[27:45] them are what a couple hundred years old
[27:47] now and if we take what history's done
[27:49] in the past and typically you know at
[27:51] least Rhymes maybe not repeats but I
[27:52] think we'll see yeah probably some of
[27:54] them go or at least uh what we all know
[27:57] is hopefully not transform into the the
[27:59] worst version of you know us um you know
[28:03] um USD uh usdt but you know just any
[28:06] type of basically cbdc um and hopefully
[28:10] we don't see those types of things
[28:12] implemented I'm sure we will um so I
[28:15] think they'll probably end up taking
[28:17] like that path first for the Fiat
[28:20] currencies you know we have like our
[28:22] stable coins that we're seeing which I
[28:24] again like I kind of like I know a lot
[28:26] of people don't like them but I'm like
[28:27] at least it's
[28:28] kind of a free market version of what
[28:31] maybe the dollar and banking system
[28:32] should have been sure it's like a
[28:33] centralized entity um some of them that
[28:36] have created it but again there's
[28:37] different types of stable coins
[28:39] obviously Fiat acted ones are kind of
[28:40] the or pegged ones or the the the the
[28:42] main ones but I'm like you know at least
[28:44] it's not like the Federal Reserve you
[28:47] know it's like a private entity that
[28:49] should be doing hopefully something
[28:50] right and you know the if you know
[28:53] Market you know can actually punish bad
[28:56] actors or bad decisions then that's what
[28:58] we had hoped for it's not the government
[29:00] just dictating one thing um with no
[29:03] repercussions um but yeah I think you
[29:05] know we'll we'll see probably a
[29:08] transition in our lifetime I would I
[29:09] would assume so um I still think we've
[29:11] got a ways you know a ways to go like
[29:13] people that think it's going to happen
[29:14] in the next five 10 years I just think
[29:16] that's a little naive like it's the
[29:19] Dollar's taking a lot longer we've been
[29:21] saying it's going to die for a while um
[29:23] and I still think there's like some
[29:24] tricks they have up their sleeve to kind
[29:26] of you know push it uh push it along a
[29:28] little way but um yeah I just think you
[29:30] know I think stable coins are probably
[29:32] that like kind of natural progression um
[29:35] and then just some other form of like
[29:37] again maybe it's not a Fiat Peg stable
[29:39] coin there's other types you can do you
[29:40] know basket or something that you know
[29:43] is uh has the underlying value of the
[29:45] asset is Peg 2 but I think um yeah we'll
[29:47] see a lot of interesting things at least
[29:48] over the next five to 10 years that can
[29:50] grow into something that might be used
[29:52] and um yeah replace you know some of
[29:55] these currencies the the the hope that I
[29:58] always have is like those pictures from
[30:01] 1920 or something like that where uh
[30:04] there's one picture in I think it was in
[30:06] New York uh taking there like a picture
[30:10] with like one car and a bunch of horses
[30:12] and like 10 years later there's a bunch
[30:15] of cars with like a few horses on the
[30:17] street uh and and I just hope that we
[30:21] hit this trigger point is inflection
[30:22] point where like it's so obvious that we
[30:25] move to a Bitcoin standard um but I
[30:28] don't know if it's hopeful wishing or or
[30:31] if it actually could re go reality and
[30:34] how quick this will go because adapting
[30:38] a Mobility different Mobility thing is
[30:41] definitely a difference to adapting a
[30:44] new monetary standard even though I'm on
[30:47] a kind of a Bitcoin standard like 100%
[30:49] in Bitcoin I still use feat every day oh
[30:53] yeah but because I have to and because
[30:55] it's volatile like the volatility is is
[30:58] still like uh bad for the use because of
[31:01] a medium exchange if you have your net
[31:04] worth and your savings fluctuating a lot
[31:07] um you're kind of inclined to especially
[31:10] if you're on the on the on the edge like
[31:12] if you you don't have like if you have
[31:14] like so much like marginal income or you
[31:17] know you you can't you can only risk but
[31:20] so much yeah yeah like if you have 10
[31:22] million in in Bitcoin and you live on a
[31:24] Bitcoin standard you don't really care
[31:26] if your stack tomorrow is like five
[31:28] million only or like 15 million yeah uh
[31:31] then it makes total sense but if for the
[31:33] Fe families that like have like a
[31:35] thousand Euros in Bitcoin and then they
[31:38] um um then the income is fluctuating
[31:41] like oh sometimes it's like 500 EUR and
[31:43] they need 800 or something is like
[31:45] thousand they need 800 so like ah that
[31:47] that that becomes all of a sudden an
[31:49] issue you can of put food on the table
[31:51] if the volatility from Bitcoin to M
[31:55] Market Goods is of all of the sudden uh
[31:58] off so that's that that's something that
[32:00] also has to decay in the volatility so
[32:04] yeah but now maybe 20 years like maybe
[32:07] 24 20 years we we see a lot more
[32:09] probably not in the next five to 10
[32:11] years but 20 years a long time and kind
[32:13] of a lot of things happening um but now
[32:15] to the question that we kind of already
[32:19] answered in in some regards but what
[32:21] exactly is is Charles doing and what are
[32:23] you doing uh there and and what's the
[32:26] vision there yeah so um as of right now
[32:28] our main focus um and what we're
[32:30] building on is again kind of getting
[32:32] ready for what we believe will be you
[32:34] know a massive wave um for when stable
[32:36] coins come to the Bitcoin lightning
[32:38] Network um so we're really focused on
[32:40] the taper asset protocol and building um
[32:43] a really really robust uh an Enterprise
[32:45] kind of grade level um wallet SDK and
[32:48] swapping service um to just to your
[32:50] point to basically provide that ux that
[32:52] we've kind of talked about for so long
[32:54] that you can get on Lightning without
[32:56] any of the kind of trade-offs um and I
[32:58] think yeah it's just critical for one
[33:00] everyday consumers but also like you
[33:02] know Enterprises and businesses to be
[33:04] able to have that just very seamless ux
[33:07] like you said it's like I can't I
[33:08] literally just can't take you know any
[33:11] type of price fluctuation you know
[33:12] beyond you know 5% or you know even just
[33:15] like one or two% um you know from dayto
[33:17] day so it's like can I just have this
[33:19] very simple uh ux where I have you know
[33:22] my stable coin account that has this
[33:25] amount in it it's sitting in bit you
[33:27] sitting
[33:28] um in the wallet you know still under
[33:30] the hood denominated in SATs Bitcoin and
[33:33] I can easily swap between the two
[33:34] whenever I need to um I can send receive
[33:37] you know any of that you know there's no
[33:40] restrictions I'm not going to hit any ux
[33:41] issues or hopefully you know any type of
[33:43] lightning um routing issues things of
[33:45] that nature having to worry about
[33:46] Channel liquidity and management and all
[33:48] that stuff just like the most simple ux
[33:50] for Mass adoption um that both
[33:52] businesses and consumers can you use um
[33:55] and luckily again tappered assets uh
[33:57] supports a lot of really interesting use
[33:59] cases um again we've done just kind of
[34:01] this payments and generally online web 3
[34:05] you know you name it doing things like
[34:06] that um but you've also got the loyalty
[34:08] and incentives uh component that I kind
[34:10] of spoke to um that's still the bulk of
[34:12] our uh business today just because we
[34:14] had focused on it for so long but um
[34:17] we've got things where like people are
[34:18] trying to do tokenization on Lightning
[34:21] where you're bringing like reward assets
[34:23] and tokenizing them on bitcoin and
[34:25] transferring the value of them or
[34:26] transferring the ownership up of them um
[34:29] over the lightning Network and and
[34:30] Bitcoin so there's some really
[34:32] interesting stuff there um we're having
[34:34] some early conversations with some
[34:35] pretty big entities and partners on that
[34:37] um and then yeah I mean our goal then
[34:41] probably for the next six months I would
[34:42] say and real real focus is just making
[34:44] sure that yeah our SDK and swapping
[34:47] service and just overall tooling um is
[34:49] really there for like you know when the
[34:51] tethers of the world the um we're
[34:53] talking with several you know kind of
[34:55] local geographical um stable coin provid
[34:57] ERS as well they want this experience
[35:00] because even some of the other stuff
[35:01] with the other l2s and side chains is
[35:03] still um a bit of a clunky process and
[35:06] it's obviously using something that is
[35:09] not technically Bitcoin it's another
[35:10] chain um so if you can do this all
[35:12] natively on Lightning that's obviously a
[35:15] killer ux much simpler um and just you
[35:18] know hopefully help you know allows them
[35:20] to grow and get more adoption which is
[35:22] what we want to see um and then I think
[35:24] uh but yeah over the next six months
[35:26] we're just going to see how the relas P
[35:27] of taper asset channels goes when kind
[35:30] of the first big stable coin you know
[35:32] provider comes and does things on on
[35:34] Lightning you know tether or usdc are
[35:37] probably the you know they are the big
[35:39] two um and then yeah waiting and seeing
[35:42] how many other businesses and
[35:43] Partnerships that we can help um just
[35:46] ease the transition onto a Bitcoin
[35:47] standard whether it's you know an
[35:49] existing Bitcoin wallet payment service
[35:52] a traditional payment service or company
[35:54] you know whoever it is um the SDK is
[35:56] really meant to be built for uh yeah to
[35:59] serve all interesting I love it a lot
[36:02] and and like this this building on
[36:04] bitcoin thing um I'm I'm kind of like
[36:07] I'm just like really bullish on on
[36:09] bitcoin as the monetary aspect uh but
[36:12] the building on bitcoin even like stable
[36:14] coins could be interesting in Bridging
[36:17] the Gap between the Fiat world to Wars
[36:21] to bitcoin standard uh I'm still not
[36:24] 100% sure how how will transition and
[36:26] the transition will be clunky and will
[36:28] be interesting but it it like it could
[36:30] lead like this this bridge between the
[36:33] fat world to the Bitcoin World it it's
[36:36] it's it's so interesting to talk up
[36:38] about this things and and see how it
[36:39] goes and I'm so grateful to have the
[36:41] podcast because then I actually can go
[36:43] ahead and in in 10 years go back and see
[36:46] like oh how did we imagine that and oh
[36:48] how how wrong we actually were think
[36:51] turn out there I do think they will be I
[36:54] think they provide like the in my mind
[36:56] they do provide like the cleanest
[36:59] transition um you know because it's like
[37:01] um you know we see we want a Bitcoin
[37:04] standard obviously um but to get there I
[37:06] just still think it's going to take some
[37:07] time but it's just it's very very clear
[37:10] from the demand on like we said on all
[37:12] the other blockchains like people want
[37:14] stable coins and the vast majority of
[37:16] them are USD denominated um still the
[37:20] whole real world you know running on the
[37:22] dollar mostly in Fiat currencies um even
[37:25] some of the lightning companies today
[37:26] you know they they are kind of built on
[37:28] that it's like yeah you use the network
[37:30] to transfer value you know with SATs
[37:33] over the you know the network but then
[37:34] you swap and move move out to your local
[37:37] currency at the you know at the edge um
[37:39] so it's just again data points that
[37:41] people want Fiat still um for you know a
[37:44] lot of their day-to-day lives and I
[37:45] think if if we bring all this liquidity
[37:48] of stable coins which is you know
[37:50] massive I mean it's already you know
[37:51] overtaking visa and things of that
[37:53] nature and just a short amount of time
[37:55] so it it's that that's why it's like
[37:58] that that is a massive opportunity a
[37:59] massive market demand you know it's like
[38:01] if this we bring any amount of this
[38:03] liquidity to bitcoin um and this
[38:06] actually starts to pick up and be used
[38:08] day-to-day as people build on bitcoin
[38:10] and see Bitcoin as the underlying you
[38:12] know Granite Foundation to build on and
[38:14] transact on you know I think if we
[38:17] believe that the underlying asset you
[38:18] know Bitcoin is right and going to win
[38:20] at the end of the day um you know it's
[38:22] just going to make that transition much
[38:24] easier if you're already kind of
[38:26] natively on Bitcoin and lightning rails
[38:29] sure you might be using a stable coin
[38:30] for your day-to-day lives but again you
[38:33] can easily swap that out you know if you
[38:35] want the Bitcoin um and then you know
[38:37] hopefully just makes that transition
[38:39] much easier than likely having some type
[38:41] of restrictions put in place by your
[38:44] bank or your you know traditional
[38:46] banking or government or whatever it
[38:47] might be you know if you're on the
[38:48] traditional banking rails you know if
[38:50] you're at least on the Bitcoin and
[38:52] lightning Tech stack then you know I
[38:54] think that transition will be much
[38:56] easier and you you don't have to ask uh
[38:59] have you know need any permission to do
[39:00] any of that so I think that's the at
[39:03] least the good stepping stone in my mind
[39:06] another interesting thought that came
[39:07] into my mind is right now is like when
[39:10] we have now the most stable coins
[39:11] obviously in USD because USD is like the
[39:15] the matter of all fat currencies and it
[39:18] gets so easy now for everyone in the
[39:20] world to just use those stable coins
[39:22] because they're not really restricted to
[39:24] any borders you can use a stable just in
[39:28] Cy um will that lead
[39:31] to even faster dying of other fear
[39:35] currencies as like the Turkish L and
[39:39] like if if you imagine like someone
[39:41] living in Turkey uh the best thing they
[39:43] can do is like for long-term savings
[39:45] just put it in Bitcoin and then for like
[39:47] the shortterm uh Fiat needs they they
[39:50] store it in in in in in 5% in in in like
[39:54] USD C or like in some stable coin of USD
[39:58] and then like just at the moment of pay
[40:01] um convert it quickly to Turkish l so
[40:04] like that's the like that would be a way
[40:06] better setup for them instead of
[40:09] actually using Turkish L yeah no I think
[40:12] you'll like again don't get me wrong
[40:14] like I think Fiat currencies will still
[40:15] have their either slow Decay and then
[40:18] some you know sometimes it's gradually
[40:20] then suddenly as we've seen with some of
[40:21] them it's like oh you know overnight
[40:23] they're gone um but regardless like
[40:25] human behavior is showing us that like
[40:27] they're still in demand they're going to
[40:28] be used um and business behavior um but
[40:31] yeah I do think it'll um and you've even
[40:33] seen to some degree you know I think it
[40:36] was the EU that just put something out
[40:38] not too long ago where you know they put
[40:40] some restrictions on some of the stable
[40:41] coins so some governments geographies
[40:44] are a little more restrictive some are a
[40:45] little more favorable but um you know I
[40:48] think that they kind of saw the writing
[40:50] on the wall and I think maybe even
[40:51] explicitly said it they're like you know
[40:52] we're we're putting these restrictions
[40:54] in place so they you know have a harder
[40:56] time over replacing our fiat currency
[40:59] but then again you'll have the other
[41:00] countries that are open um and more like
[41:03] I would say like things in like latam
[41:05] that are really starting to pick up with
[41:07] you know Bitcoin adoption um and
[41:09] lightning adoption even more
[41:11] particularly but stable coins is
[41:12] becoming a big thing there I think
[41:13] you're seeing it in Southeast Asia
[41:15] Africa so like you're going to have
[41:17] again kind of a open market free market
[41:20] of you know countries that make their
[41:22] own decisions and whatever their
[41:24] policies and legal structure they put in
[41:26] place um but again there's also like I
[41:29] think you I think you will see like
[41:30] again we're talking with some of them as
[41:31] well but we are starting to see some
[41:33] really interesting projects that are
[41:35] just not fatback you know stable coins
[41:38] um like I I I know they're like the the
[41:40] bulk of things right now but I mean
[41:42] there's some that are just like coming
[41:43] up that are pretty pretty cool you know
[41:44] over collateralized um you've got some
[41:46] that just have some really interesting
[41:47] Tech and way of doing this they're
[41:49] backed by other assets that are not as
[41:52] you know exposed to this type of you
[41:54] know manipulation or you know overall
[41:56] devaluing um some that are backed by
[41:58] gold Commodities other things that
[42:00] people find Value in the real world
[42:02] whether you you know you like them or
[42:03] not but um I do think there'll be some
[42:05] some interesting things that come out um
[42:07] over the next few years that just makes
[42:09] like stable coin as an asset class
[42:12] overall on bitcoin just super super
[42:14] attractive um and will definitely
[42:16] benefit the lightning Network and its
[42:17] growth um and adoption I think because
[42:20] yeah I just think you have to have it if
[42:21] we really want Real World Adoption from
[42:23] like businesses and Merchants we've kind
[42:25] of got the consumer side and people like
[42:26] hooked on like oh it's this store value
[42:28] or it's going to go up in price but if
[42:30] we really want Bitcoin to become this
[42:32] media of exchange day-to-day um without
[42:34] having to have concerns for the price
[42:36] you know movement um compared to any
[42:38] Fiat value it's just going to have to
[42:39] have something that's looks natively
[42:41] just kind of like our rewards concept
[42:43] it's like it's got to look and act and
[42:44] feel just like I'm using Fiat as I was
[42:47] you know on traditional banking rails uh
[42:49] I think for businesses to really start
[42:51] accepting it using it either between
[42:53] businesses vendors Partnerships and also
[42:55] there in customers and users really nice
[42:58] yeah I'm I'm kind of like this this
[43:00] bridging idea uh I love it never thought
[43:04] about stable coins and even like cbdcs
[43:06] maybe being the bridge to the Bitcoin
[43:08] standard interesting um I have to think
[43:10] about that
[43:13] cbdcs I feel like they they will come
[43:15] anyways like uh I mean like maybe it'll
[43:18] be so good that people like I don't want
[43:20] that and they'll just run to the Bitcoin
[43:21] standard so it's like I'm opting out of
[43:23] that yeah it's it's it's like When You
[43:27] See It of a practical standpoint it's
[43:29] like oh I still have the bad monetary
[43:32] policy but now the government puts uh uh
[43:36] spending limits on it and they can trace
[43:38] me even better and it's programmable uh
[43:41] in a sense so it's like I mean they can
[43:43] effectively do that now anyway I'm
[43:45] always like people are like cbdcs are
[43:46] coming I'm like it's basically that
[43:48] already I was like they can stop your
[43:49] bank account they print it whenever they
[43:51] want it's already digital like it's we
[43:54] already have basically cbdcs whether
[43:55] people like to kind of admit it or not
[43:58] yeah that's what I'm thinking like I
[43:59] feel like they they will come and I
[44:02] don't know what what the difference
[44:04] actually is right now it's like yes they
[44:07] they will have maybe even more control
[44:10] and the the main thing is probably like
[44:13] cutting out the the commercial Banks
[44:16] maybe that the Federal Reserve directly
[44:18] has a wallet with yeah um the end
[44:22] consumer and like cutting out a little
[44:24] bit of decentralization like at least we
[44:27] Bing system around that that was like it
[44:29] just centralized even more and makes the
[44:32] bad things worse and the good things
[44:34] completely disappear yeah it literally
[44:37] is just the F the FED now
[44:41] so that that's very true yeah it's an
[44:44] interesting concept but yeah uh you I
[44:48] think cbdcs will will come in in some
[44:50] regard uh and they will hopefully as we
[44:54] saw in Nigeria completely fail and
[44:57] people will not adopt it I know I will
[44:59] not adopt it uh uh if if if not some
[45:03] policeman comes and and force me to it
[45:05] hope it does not come to that in Austria
[45:08] but yeah uh before we come to the endine
[45:10] of the podcast I have one question that
[45:12] I ask everyone of my guests um what can
[45:15] we learn from you besides Bitcoin yeah
[45:18] um sorry me or jol
[45:20] specifically yeah you you usually I go
[45:23] on the person like if if there something
[45:25] that's also like interesting but if if
[45:28] uh usually I go on the person I can give
[45:31] some really mean tennis lessons um I
[45:33] played tennis for quite a while um so I
[45:35] I thought I was going to go professional
[45:36] like I played played in college and then
[45:38] learned I was like all right I'm not
[45:39] going to go professional so I can always
[45:40] give some cool tennis lessons but I'm no
[45:42] I'm pretty well educated and um I mean
[45:45] again I love I love technology um my
[45:47] past life I was a systems engineer and
[45:49] Cloud architect so I you know I've
[45:51] worked in the more traditional it World
[45:53] um love that um big big uh fan like I
[45:57] said Roger feder fan so I can give you a
[45:58] lot of information about tennis facts
[46:00] and stuff like that um huge Formula 1
[46:02] fan um I do racing simulator racing and
[46:06] um yeah follow Formula One really really
[46:07] close to say they just had the race up
[46:09] near you the uh the other week yeah so
[46:11] there's a lot of things I think you can
[46:12] learn and I mean working in a startup
[46:14] day today um you end up wearing quite a
[46:18] different lot of hats and doing a lot of
[46:20] different things so um I've learned a
[46:22] lot of different things I never thought
[46:23] I would in my life um you know and I've
[46:25] worked on certain startups before for uh
[46:27] jolts as well so um yeah I've learned a
[46:29] lot of things from Business Development
[46:31] sales technology legal um you know you
[46:34] kind of name it marketing um there's
[46:36] just a slew of things that you kind of
[46:38] have to root force and learn and almost
[46:40] try to become an expert in when you're
[46:41] uh you know you head up a startup
[46:43] absolutely yeah it's it's it's
[46:46] fascinating to see uh all all those
[46:48] developments and when you are when you
[46:50] start something you learn a lot yeah
[46:53] great um our entro is uh pretty simple
[46:56] the previous guest is asking a question
[46:58] for the next guest without knowing who
[46:59] the next guest actually is uh so you get
[47:01] a question from the previous guest and
[47:03] your question from the previous guest is
[47:05] do you think sat Toshi's goal was to fix
[47:09] the money or was there some other goal
[47:13] uh and if yes what was the goal I
[47:15] personally think I don't know if it was
[47:18] to fix the money I think it was more of
[47:21] a I think it was more of a way to like
[47:24] just I I don't want to I'm not going to
[47:25] curse but there's the uh unable money
[47:27] book um I don't know if you've ever read
[47:29] that one but I feel it was more of a way
[47:30] to just say like I am opting out like I
[47:33] don't necessarily need to fix like the
[47:36] US dollar or you know fiat currency it's
[47:38] just a way to say like no government I'm
[47:41] opting out I'm I can do things on my own
[47:43] and I can basically be you know
[47:46] self-sufficient um and not have to you
[47:48] know depend on you know the currency
[47:51] that you're providing me um because I
[47:53] still think like Bitcoin does have its
[47:55] you know potential risk you know like
[47:57] nothing's perfect um so I do think like
[47:59] it's the best thing that's been created
[48:01] to date um but I think he was really
[48:04] going for a way to you know opt out of
[48:06] the current system and just have a way
[48:08] that people can just be um yeah
[48:10] self-sufficient I love it and he
[48:12] accidentally maybe just fixed money by
[48:15] that because I mean Bitcoin impacts a
[48:18] lot of things and you know he just
[48:19] stepped away so I was like you know to
[48:21] not still have any influence after you
[48:23] know leaving it kind of so early it's
[48:25] like it's you know I'm thank that he
[48:27] stepped away because it kind of gives
[48:28] Bitcoin a lot of the you know value and
[48:32] you know very compelling interest
[48:33] because it's like oh there's this person
[48:35] that just built this and then stepped
[48:36] away and you know had the kind of
[48:38] courage and determination to still do
[48:40] that I think that's that's really
[48:41] powerful absolutely uh really cool um
[48:44] before I let you go where can people uh
[48:47] message you ask you questions or ask
[48:49] questions about
[48:51] Jes yeah they can um as of right now um
