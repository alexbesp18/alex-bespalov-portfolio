[00:00] it's irresponsible to a shareholder for
[00:02] an energy company not to figure out
[00:04] Bitcoin mining like you've been warned
[00:07] energy companies are sitting on these
[00:09] assets that they aren't even aware that
[00:12] they can add tremendous value to their
[00:15] companies just by integrating Bitcoin
[00:17] mining before Bitcoin we didn't have a
[00:20] money that the whole world could use I
[00:22] would like to continue with being
[00:24] irresponsibly long Bitcoin I don't want
[00:27] to own any other equities I do believe
[00:29] that Bitcoin demonetizes value from all
[00:33] other assets but the little known Secret
[00:36] inside the energy
[00:38] sector and your PIN tweet is really
[00:40] interesting I never heard that before um
[00:43] you talk about the next wave of Bitcoin
[00:45] adoption comes from the energy companies
[00:48] and especially the sentence with like um
[00:51] we have to monetize every molecule um
[00:54] what do you mean by that what does the
[00:57] the the meaning behind that and what is
[00:59] that new wave of adoption of Bitcoin
[01:01] with energy the biggest hurdle for any
[01:04] minor today is securing
[01:07] long-term energy right securing a
[01:10] long-term energy source whether or not
[01:12] you are on or off grid whether or not
[01:15] you
[01:15] are going to
[01:17] landfills using you know really novel um
[01:22] applications for Bitcoin
[01:24] mining everyone has the same hurdle and
[01:27] that is finding a power source in order
[01:31] to plug their A6 into right somewhere to
[01:34] let where do I plug my computer in but
[01:37] the little known Secret inside the
[01:39] energy sector and this is what I I'm
[01:41] trying to wake them up and there are
[01:43] many others trying to wake them up is
[01:45] that the energy companies already have
[01:48] all of these uh all of these molecules
[01:52] that are available that they waste and
[01:55] so I'll give you some examples maybe
[01:56] this is kind of the easiest way to think
[01:58] about it uh so
[02:00] for those of you who don't know for
[02:03] maybe some of your listeners who who
[02:04] don't know um so natural gas is a very
[02:08] common fuel that's used to run power
[02:11] generation facilities all over the US uh
[02:15] we've gone from you know a huge portion
[02:17] of Our Generation in Coal to now a huge
[02:22] portion in gas we're now making the
[02:24] shift you know in the last call it 10
[02:26] years 15 years we've made the shift to
[02:28] even more Renewables
[02:30] becoming a part of the power generation
[02:32] mix for the
[02:35] country but if we look at Natural Gas
[02:38] specifically natural gas travels across
[02:42] the United States through pipelines and
[02:45] it's very much like a spider web there
[02:48] are a lot of um you know there there are
[02:50] big pipelines that can move a lot of gas
[02:55] there are smaller pipelines there's um
[02:58] interconnects there's there's places
[03:00] where there are many
[03:03] pipelines um when we see the natural gas
[03:07] price on the CNBC screen that represents
[03:11] the Henry Hub physical natural gas that
[03:14] is being delivered for a 30-day period
[03:17] so it's March 17th so right now um if we
[03:22] were to look at
[03:23] CNBC it would be the April Futures
[03:28] Contract but what happens is if I'm an
[03:31] energy company and I'm let's say I
[03:33] produce natural gas if I don't have um
[03:38] if if I haven't already sold my
[03:42] contracts at the end of the month to
[03:45] someone else well let me let me start
[03:46] this way sorry if if I if I am long the
[03:50] Futures Contract at the end of let's
[03:52] just say I'm a Speculator and at the end
[03:54] of the month I'm long
[03:56] Futures what happens is those Futures
[03:58] actually turn into molecules so instead
[04:01] of it being a financial product you now
[04:04] have physical natural gas that you have
[04:06] to figure out where to put and so for
[04:09] listeners this is what happened
[04:13] in April of 2020 when crude oil traded
[04:19] $35 a lot of people were saying oh my
[04:22] God I can't believe it traded Nega $35
[04:24] why would crude oil ever be negative and
[04:27] the reason is because store storage was
[04:30] full if you can remember like we were
[04:32] shutting down Airlines the demand was
[04:35] drastically decreased like at a hugely
[04:38] rapid rate right there was no real
[04:40] preparation for the fact that the demand
[04:41] was just going to
[04:43] disappear and so somebody was long
[04:48] contracts at expiration so at the end of
[04:50] the month prior there was a speculative
[04:54] book right who was long and they had to
[04:57] take delivery and then that person
[04:59] forced who's literally holding like you
[05:02] know let's say there's crude oil in my
[05:03] cup like here's the crude oil you have
[05:06] to go put this
[05:08] somewhere you've got to go look for a
[05:10] storage facility or someone that can buy
[05:13] it and that someone might
[05:16] be somebody who has pipeline capacity
[05:19] who can kind of fudge the numbers or
[05:22] it's a you know I mean they're obvious
[05:24] places where you can store it but all
[05:28] that to say gas trades physically and it
[05:31] trades
[05:32] financially on the physical side it's
[05:35] very real you optimize molecules all
[05:38] over the US in order
[05:41] to um you know in order to make money so
[05:44] if if you are a an energy company you
[05:48] might have let's say that you're a um I
[05:51] I worked for pg& Energy company I'll use
[05:53] an example I worked for pg& energy
[05:56] trading we were a speculative trading
[05:58] desk and and we had uh I think three TCF
[06:03] 3 trillion cubic feet of Natural Gas
[06:05] Salt Dome storage that was located in
[06:07] the Gulf Coast we had pipeline capacity
[06:10] that we had contracted for and then we
[06:13] had 4500 megawatts of power
[06:17] generation and so it wasn't uh you know
[06:21] trading natural gas isn't like is the
[06:24] price going higher or lower it's much
[06:27] more about gathering information
[06:30] in the market and then forming a thesis
[06:33] and utilizing your assets so if gas is
[06:37] $2 in the Gulf Coast and 200 in the
[06:41] Northeast I'm using like huge numbers so
[06:45] that you get the sense of what I'm
[06:46] trying to
[06:47] explain you obviously can figure out you
[06:50] know your your brain is like let me
[06:51] figure out how to move $2 gas and turn
[06:53] it into $200 gas it's really not that uh
[06:56] dramatic when you're trading but but
[06:58] there are margins and people do make
[07:00] money doing that okay to get back to
[07:02] Bitcoin mining in Bitcoin mining the the
[07:06] miners are now looking
[07:08] for Reliable power sources and while
[07:13] it's great that they're pushing for you
[07:15] know oh let's go mine off methane in a
[07:17] landfill like I love that that's
[07:20] fantastic you know let's go to a hydro a
[07:24] dam and mine okay again that's
[07:27] fantastic but there's a lot lot of
[07:29] infrastructure that sits unused in the
[07:32] United States where you can also mine
[07:36] and the
[07:38] miners are now become I mean they they
[07:40] are aware right they're extremely smart
[07:43] unfortunately the energy companies by
[07:46] and large still watch Fox News and hear
[07:51] Elizabeth
[07:53] Warren say Bitcoin is only good for
[07:56] terrorists to
[07:57] use you know Bitcoin is bad Bitcoin
[08:02] is whatever right those narratives are
[08:06] so
[08:08] hard to
[08:11] negate and so I live in Texas everybody
[08:14] most people know this I live in
[08:16] Houston my friends are the folks that
[08:19] are in these energy companies right our
[08:21] kids went to preschool together 20 years
[08:23] ago they live in my neighborhood I see
[08:26] them at the restaurants I eat at in my
[08:28] neighborhood right
[08:30] that's still their impression that
[08:32] Bitcoin is used by North Korea for arms
[08:38] trading so I spend a lot of time saying
[08:44] guys let's set all of those narratives
[08:48] aside you can think that it's used by
[08:50] terrorists you can think that the North
[08:52] Koreans use it think whatever you want
[08:55] about Bitcoin and I'm not asking you to
[08:57] hold Bitcoin on your balance sheet
[09:00] but if you are a power
[09:04] producer and you don't have a
[09:08] matched uh if if there's not enough
[09:11] demand for all of your power that you're
[09:14] making every day of the
[09:17] year then there's Supply demand mismatch
[09:21] and what happens is the power
[09:25] generators often pay to have power taken
[09:29] from them so that they don't have to
[09:30] shut down a
[09:32] huge um Power Plant right it's just
[09:36] they've let's just let's just keep it
[09:38] running we'll pay to have this taken
[09:39] away
[09:41] temporarily so that's the same thing
[09:44] that's
[09:45] happening you know out in um people in
[09:49] Bitcoin mining speak a lot about the
[09:50] flared
[09:51] gas great use case captures a lot of
[09:55] headlines but there's also a lot of
[10:00] disadvantaged gas so there's gas that
[10:04] needs to go into a pipeline but
[10:07] depending on the weather depending on
[10:09] the storage that's
[10:11] available right depending on a lot of
[10:15] outside
[10:16] factors that gas at times like this week
[10:22] gas out in um out in West Texas has
[10:25] traded negative so again what you're
[10:28] saying is you have a gas producer who's
[10:32] gone into the capital markets right
[10:34] who's coordinated Capital maybe they've
[10:36] borrowed money they've issued shares
[10:39] they've structured debt deal whatever it
[10:42] is that they've done right they've
[10:44] coordinated capital in the free
[10:47] market and now they have to pay someone
[10:51] to take the product they
[10:53] produced that makes no sense so when I
[10:57] went to the coffee shop today
[11:00] 0% of the time did they pay a customer
[11:03] to take coffee yet in the energy world
[11:07] it's very
[11:09] common and so it's my overall thesis
[11:13] just to wrap this up it's my overall
[11:16] thesis that the Bitcoin miners are the
[11:18] next wave of
[11:20] adopters simply because it Mak sense for
[11:24] their business models it allows them to
[11:27] monetize molecules that otherwise have
[11:30] not been able to
[11:33] monetize so just to summarize just to
[11:35] make sure I've understood that right
[11:38] they are the energy sources the energy
[11:40] producers um they have basically
[11:43] stranded energy more energy they they
[11:45] can use and they leaving the money on
[11:48] the table to monetize on that energy
[11:51] because they have um misconceptions
[11:55] about Bitcoin honestly they just don't
[11:58] know yet I I don't think that it's it's
[12:00] a misconception on their
[12:03] part that um I had dinner last night
[12:07] with uh with a good friend a longtime
[12:10] Texan um you know
[12:12] houstonian uh hugely involved in the
[12:15] Midstream part of the gas
[12:17] business and we we had this exact
[12:20] conversation he's not a bitcoiner he
[12:22] doesn't
[12:23] understand and he said well I just don't
[12:26] I just don't get it like why don't they
[12:28] why can't they hear this like why aren't
[12:30] they all over this there must be a
[12:32] reason why they're all over
[12:34] it I don't think there's any reason
[12:37] whatsoever
[12:39] particularly that they're not all over
[12:41] it but they're really good at what they
[12:45] do and you know as Bitcoin
[12:49] miners we want natural gas what most of
[12:53] these huge producers produce uh what
[12:56] their main focus is crude oil right and
[13:00] in in some of these places gas and oil
[13:03] come up together uh it's crude oil is
[13:07] their number
[13:09] one uh focus and so if they can still
[13:13] coordinate Capital drill a hole in the
[13:15] ground get crude oil and get it to
[13:19] Market that's where they're going to
[13:20] focus right the the Bitcoin mining what
[13:23] it does is it allows you to monetize
[13:25] these molecules whether or not they're
[13:27] it's it's you know at the power
[13:29] generation side or you know in the field
[13:32] in the at at the producer level um for
[13:36] gas it allows them to like fine-tune
[13:38] their operation right it's not the bulk
[13:41] of their operation it's like the
[13:45] fine-tune maybe to have some um like
[13:49] comparison of some um Imagination how
[13:52] much this can be like uh how much of
[13:55] that energy produced that could be used
[13:58] for Bitcoin mining uh and also the
[14:01] potential for um Bitcoin miners to
[14:03] monetize like for the energy producers
[14:05] to monetize on that how how big are we
[14:08] talking is this like something that is
[14:11] um hugely more than we now mining would
[14:15] that uh get the mining up to like 10%
[14:18] 50% um do you have some kind of
[14:21] imagination how how big or how how
[14:24] impactful this could be for the energy
[14:27] producers and Bitcoin mining
[14:31] yeah I I would
[14:35] say um when Bitcoin is a million dollars
[14:39] this becomes a lot bigger deal right
[14:42] Bitcoin has been this volatile sort of
[14:45] stepchild of the financial industry
[14:48] we're not quite sure if we're going to
[14:49] let it live here we might kill it um if
[14:53] you listen to CNBC right it's dying
[14:55] tomorrow the The Regulators are going to
[14:56] kill it tomorrow um and so the energy
[15:00] companies haven't had a huge incentive
[15:04] to figure it out
[15:08] but they will right I mean now this week
[15:11] we saw gas uh on the NX trade I think it
[15:14] was like
[15:16] a170 and we've got Bitcoin trading
[15:19] 70,000 like it's going to begin to ring
[15:22] some Bells here because natural gas
[15:25] prices are declining and in fact my
[15:27] friend I was with last night said oh you
[15:30] know natural gas has hit the
[15:32] floor and I said explain to me why it's
[15:35] hit the floor and he said Well it can't
[15:38] go any lower than
[15:40] a170 and I said well factually it
[15:42] absolutely can go a lot lower than a170
[15:45] I mean I traded natural gas and it went
[15:49] to like 10 cents once like it can go a
[15:53] lot lower right where we had a crude oil
[15:56] print granted it wasn't for very much
[15:58] volume but we had a o print at
[16:00] $35 in 2020 it can factually go lower
[16:07] but
[16:09] um okay I'll tell you another
[16:11] conversation I've had recently had a
[16:13] conversation with a um an offshore
[16:16] producer out in the Gulf of
[16:18] Mexico and I said hey are you guys
[16:21] looking at Bitcoin mining and he started
[16:24] laughing he
[16:26] no I was like how much do you get for
[16:28] your Gap gas and he said oh you know we
[16:31] get Henry Hub pricing for our
[16:34] gas I'm like okay well so at the time
[16:37] Henry Hub pricing was like $225 or
[16:39] something
[16:42] $2 okay well what if I told you that I
[16:45] could buy your natural gas for $7 right
[16:49] like or
[16:51] $10 would you sell it to me rather than
[16:54] put it in the
[16:55] pipeline and he was like well yeah but
[16:57] how are we going to do that
[16:59] H and I'm like I think we can figure it
[17:02] out right if you can figure out how to
[17:04] pull natural resources out of the bottom
[17:07] of the ocean
[17:08] floor we can figure out how to hook up
[17:12] gas to a Bitcoin mining facility on the
[17:16] water right like I don't think this is
[17:18] out of the realm of
[17:23] possibility they can't think of it all
[17:26] they can throw up at the moment are Road
[17:29] and the reason that it's you know oh we
[17:31] can't do that because we have to if we
[17:33] put in a new toilet on a rig we have to
[17:35] go get it permitted oh we have to go to
[17:37] the this regulatory three-letter agency
[17:41] and get approval let me tell you when
[17:44] they can turn gas in you know not $2 gas
[17:49] when it's $10 gas or $15 gas they are
[17:53] going to go and figure out how to do
[17:56] it and I think it
[18:00] it's let's just give them a pass up
[18:03] until
[18:06] today I think it's irresponsible to a
[18:08] shareholder for an energy company not to
[18:12] figure out Bitcoin mining like you've
[18:15] been
[18:16] warned the information is out there I
[18:20] mean I talk about it
[18:22] constantly I've been on a number of
[18:24] podcasts beating the drum there are a
[18:26] lot of other people who beat the same
[18:28] drum um like if you haven't heard the
[18:35] message there's got to be one person
[18:37] within an energy company that has
[18:39] figured this
[18:41] out but this is kind of the it seems to
[18:45] me it's uh that it's like the orange
[18:47] peing process with everyone uh I also
[18:49] see it with friends and family members I
[18:52] see it with so many people like like
[18:55] even like big people that got orange
[18:57] peed and they usually have um a lot of
[19:01] misconceptions or like they have they
[19:03] did not figure it out and then they get
[19:05] more than they see the price run up they
[19:07] see the price crashing so the interest
[19:09] comes in uh and then they have uh like I
[19:13] call it fat they have misconceptions
[19:15] they have something in their brain like
[19:16] oh Bitcoin but what if uh government
[19:19] shuts it down or this and that so they
[19:21] have this this questiones in their mind
[19:24] but as they educate them more and more
[19:28] themselves they get Bitcoin more and
[19:30] more so after a while they they get more
[19:33] and more into Bitcoin and it seems like
[19:35] it's kind of similar story uh with those
[19:38] energy companies uh that they uh need
[19:42] those this education line uh but
[19:45] honestly the as you said the information
[19:48] is out there uh the the education is out
[19:50] there there are a lot of people talking
[19:52] about this uh and they could do it but
[19:56] what interests me now um you also come
[19:58] from uh that sector you also like got
[20:02] over the hurdle to bitcoin you probably
[20:04] also had when you first started hearing
[20:06] about Bitcoin some something in your
[20:09] mind that you got over it like I called
[20:11] Bitcoin a scam for over three years
[20:13] before I even bought my first one uh how
[20:17] and why did you then decided to to get
[20:20] into Bitcoin and like what what what did
[20:23] you needed to get
[20:24] over I Ed Bitcoin because I was greedy
[20:29] I mean I was looking at I I had done a
[20:31] deep dive into my
[20:33] investment uh portfolio I I had an
[20:36] investment
[20:37] advisor and I printed off all
[20:41] the Holdings of of every mutual fund
[20:45] that he had me
[20:47] in and you know I kind of loosely built
[20:50] an Excel spreadsheet of you know where
[20:53] were the bulk of my um where you know
[20:57] what what was I really invested in and
[21:00] what I discovered was that although I
[21:02] was in 26 different mutual funds most of
[21:05] those funds had Apple Microsoft Facebook
[21:10] Nvidia right they were the top Holdings
[21:14] or certainly a huge percentage of almost
[21:16] every one of those
[21:19] funds and I
[21:21] thought why am I paying this guy so
[21:26] much to construct to to do this
[21:29] financial
[21:31] engineering and make me sign a million
[21:34] pages of
[21:35] disclosures so that I can buy Apple like
[21:39] I can buy Apple by myself thanks and I
[21:42] started having conversations with
[21:45] him like look I'm not interested in a
[21:49] bunch of this other junk I'm not
[21:50] interested in having a Real Estate
[21:52] Investment Trust portfolio I'm not
[21:54] interested in any bonds at all like I I
[21:58] just
[22:00] IM religiously against bonds I think
[22:03] that that is hij jaxer I mean I made
[22:06] that word up but like that you you I I
[22:09] had somebody last night the same person
[22:10] last night said to me um I said do you
[22:13] have uh he's he's a wealth manager do
[22:17] you have um clients in bond funds and he
[22:21] said oh I do he said yeah and um you
[22:24] know one of my favorite bond funds the
[22:26] two fund managers recently left left and
[22:29] they went blah blah blah and they
[22:30] started their own fund and I said well
[22:32] is it a bond fund and he said oh yeah
[22:34] it's a it's a high yield municipal bond
[22:37] fund it's it's a great um investment for
[22:41] many of my clients and I said well what
[22:43] makes it great and he said well I mean
[22:46] like it yields like
[22:49] 11% and I said well
[22:53] okay but I mean inflation is 11% so it
[22:57] really yield zero
[23:00] well inflation's really not
[23:03] 11% I said okay well what do you think
[23:06] it is 5% I mean we were having dinner
[23:09] and you just ordered a
[23:11] $90 piece of fish like what you tell me
[23:15] what's inflation and he said well you
[23:17] know my clients aren't really impacted
[23:19] by
[23:21] inflation um you know they they just
[23:23] want to see cash flow they just want to
[23:25] see an income stream you know blah blah
[23:27] blah this is and I said
[23:30] 'w okay they're not impacted by
[23:32] inflation is what you're telling me but
[23:36] you know to use kind of like Michael
[23:37] sailor's example if the boat's taking on
[23:40] 2% every year the boat the boat takes on
[23:43] 2% more water right it has a hole it's
[23:46] leaking takes on
[23:48] water like we're arguing over how much
[23:51] water it's taking
[23:52] on but it's really still taking on water
[23:56] do we all agree that at some point it
[24:01] sinks well
[24:03] not and he looked at me and he was like
[24:06] okay I hear you I hear you and I just
[24:09] said you can't I mean I like I don't
[24:13] understand this like I don't understand
[24:15] how somebody could be in a bond
[24:18] fund and not own
[24:22] Bitcoin and actually and if you don't
[24:24] mind I'll like go on this other tangent
[24:27] of what I learned and I'm going to get
[24:28] this data and I'll probably end up
[24:29] tweeting about it but um and then we got
[24:32] off on this tangent
[24:34] of how he has uh he's done a bunch of
[24:38] research and there is a bunch of
[24:39] research that's
[24:41] published
[24:42] about University endowments and their
[24:47] Holdings and what the percentage is that
[24:52] they hold of private Equity or
[24:55] alternative
[24:57] Investments
[24:59] and the number is astonishing like 35%
[25:03] of portfolio is private equity in an in
[25:06] a university endowment or I I will pull
[25:09] this up and I'll when I find it I'll tag
[25:12] you in my Twitter
[25:14] um think about that I said how is it
[25:18] possible that endowments hold
[25:22] 35% in private Equity deals or
[25:25] alternative Investments and they have
[25:27] zero
[25:32] Bitcoin amazing like it's this Bitcoin
[25:36] is the safest asset on Earth it's the
[25:39] most
[25:40] scce right it may be volatile in the
[25:42] short
[25:44] term but it's still so widely
[25:47] misunderstood yeah it's like uh and this
[25:50] is why I'm always so uh like I got a
[25:56] message uh two weeks ago uh about
[25:59] someone that just want to start uh his
[26:01] podcast and he just like oh you just
[26:03] recently start a podcast I was I'm
[26:05] growing quite fast and and he was like
[26:08] uh can you help me and then I responded
[26:09] to him with a long message I gave him
[26:11] tips and he was like what you actually
[26:12] do this and I was like of course we we
[26:15] are on a mission like I I'm not like oh
[26:18] you're doing a podcast we in competition
[26:20] no we need so many more Educators we
[26:22] need more podcasts we need more speakers
[26:24] we need more people talking about this
[26:27] this matter because we are so small
[26:30] still H and we need to educate people so
[26:33] much more and there like there's so many
[26:35] misconceptions out there and if if I
[26:38] leave my Bitcoin bubble a little bit I
[26:41] go into uh my old workplace go into some
[26:44] friends that I'm not in regular contact
[26:46] with because my friends that I'm like
[26:48] they are almost all now Bitcoin but uh
[26:52] uh outside this is like there's you can
[26:54] read the headlines of the mainstream
[26:57] media uh when you talk with them they're
[27:00] like one headline after one headline
[27:02] after one headline and it it annoys me
[27:04] that we need that we need so much more
[27:07] education and this comes also a little
[27:08] bit now to my next question about self
[27:11] responsibility and and because with
[27:13] Bitcoin you really learn fast either you
[27:16] learn it from the community or you learn
[27:18] it because you got humbled uh you you
[27:21] lost your coins you something happened
[27:24] um you learn how to take care of your
[27:26] Bitcoin yourself you learn that you have
[27:29] to take care of your finances yourself
[27:32] as you also did with with taking it out
[27:35] of of the many funds and putting it in
[27:39] uh what you wanted to put it in and not
[27:42] like get charged like a big management
[27:44] fee for basically nothing um do you
[27:48] think when we move closer to the Bitcoin
[27:50] standard when we move closer to a a mass
[27:54] adoption do you think Bitcoin also
[27:57] changes
[27:58] Society or will the people that are
[28:01] self- sovereign always be a minority and
[28:04] the other people just use Bitcoin
[28:06] because they are kind of used they kind
[28:08] of forced to use it because of like uh
[28:10] Bitcoin is the fundamental layer of our
[28:13] society do you think we can actually um
[28:16] have a change with Bitcoin or is Bitcoin
[28:18] just money and it does not change
[28:19] society how long are you gonna give me
[28:21] to ramble on this as long as you
[28:26] want maximum one hour
[28:28] I do think it changes
[28:30] Society it is what gives me hope right
[28:34] our world is effed
[28:37] up you don't have to go any further than
[28:39] your local airport to understand that
[28:42] the world is
[28:43] sick we are all facing tremendous stress
[28:48] and health challenges there's an obesity
[28:53] epidemic
[28:56] um you know I saw statistic that the
[28:59] average person is on seven prescription
[29:02] medications
[29:03] seven yeah that may not be correct fact
[29:07] check me
[29:09] but you know I think of my
[29:12] grandparents
[29:14] and their their life wasn't like
[29:19] that their lives weren't like this they
[29:23] they were happy they had Community they
[29:26] took vacations every year
[29:28] I mean like vacations like to Egypt or
[29:33] to Turkey or you know I
[29:37] mean you you can't even do that today
[29:40] right I mean you you can I guess you can
[29:43] you can go to Egypt you can go to Turkey
[29:45] but the world
[29:46] is um is not as safe as it once was and
[29:50] that wasn't very long ago 50 years ago
[29:52] my grandparents were in Turkey less than
[29:55] that okay I'm going to launch into this
[29:57] just for a second I'll try and keep this
[29:59] super brief
[30:02] but if we think about
[30:08] how if if we think of of what we're
[30:12] trying to uh H how to best build a
[30:17] society how to and whether or not we do
[30:20] that on an individual level or on a city
[30:22] or state or country or
[30:26] continent LEL we have to have an
[30:30] understanding and an agreement of one
[30:34] thing and that
[30:36] is what is the Bas layer tool for
[30:43] communication and so if I live in the
[30:49] United States and I make
[30:52] sweaters and I want to sell my
[30:55] sweaters um and I want to sh them and
[30:58] and make them available in all parts of
[31:00] the
[31:01] world there has to be an agreement on
[31:04] what's on the other side of the
[31:07] transaction of the
[31:09] sweater and it's money right money is on
[31:12] the other side of the
[31:14] transaction well in fact money is on the
[31:17] other side of every
[31:21] transaction when we talk about GDP on
[31:24] the other side of GDP is money
[32:28] my economic value to society should be
[32:32] equal
[32:34] to and equal in the sense of um I should
[32:39] be able to to price my economic
[32:44] value in the strongest form of
[32:47] money so I should be able to use the
[32:50] strongest form of money as the other
[32:53] side of the trade for my economic value
[32:57] if I make a S I should be able to hold
[33:00] that value in a hard
[33:03] money I think we've seen what happens
[33:06] when you know I when we've cut off
[33:09] Russia from the Swift
[33:11] system we did so because we wanted to
[33:13] punish them uh we didn't like what they
[33:16] were doing in
[33:20] Ukraine and so we kicked them out of a
[33:23] global monetary
[33:25] network
[33:26] but should money be
[33:31] censorable by one nation over another or
[33:35] should money just be the base layer of
[33:38] communication between All Nations and if
[33:41] you have good
[33:44] money you aren't going to want to spend
[33:48] it
[33:49] on cheap Chinese plastic items that you
[33:53] buy at your local drugstore right if you
[33:56] have good money you aren't going to want
[33:58] to spend it on my
[34:00] sweaters you know at infin item you may
[34:03] want one of something or two but not
[34:08] 200 you see the value of of trading in a
[34:13] good money and holding a good
[34:15] money and before Bitcoin we didn't have
[34:19] a
[34:20] money that the whole world could
[34:23] use much like we don't have a language
[34:25] that the whole world speaks
[34:29] right we try to think oh well everyone
[34:31] speaks
[34:32] English well no they don't nor should
[34:35] they right nor should they have to speak
[34:38] English just because we control the
[34:41] dollar and we are the global Reserve
[34:44] currency we we should be able to respect
[34:48] others cultures and respect their
[34:50] economic contribution to the global
[34:55] society and we should respect their
[34:57] right to hold sound money and so all
[35:01] that to say I mean I think Bitcoin is a
[35:04] language and Bitcoin is the first
[35:06] language that we all can speak
[35:08] throughout the world 21 Bitcoin is
[35:11] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[35:14] and preach self- custody this is my goto
[35:17] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[35:20] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[35:22] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[35:25] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[35:28] support this podcast use code Robin and
[35:31] click the link in the description it's
[35:33] it's it's so so beautiful because um I
[35:36] speak and this is why I intentionally
[35:39] made the podcast in English because my
[35:41] first language is German uh and for me
[35:44] it's hard to speak in English but I'm
[35:45] getting better with every day like some
[35:49] some people write me why I'm speaking
[35:50] English when I cannot speak English in
[35:52] my comments but I try my best but my
[35:55] reason was uh not only
[35:58] because of because there are really
[35:59] strong bitcoiners actually in the German
[36:01] community there are other communities
[36:04] where the local language is not as
[36:06] strong but the German community for
[36:07] whatever reason is really strong which
[36:11] with Bitcoin only content like uh
[36:13] altcoins and shitcoins are not as
[36:16] popular uh in in Germany Austria in the
[36:19] Swiss as my subjective feeling is I
[36:21] don't have data backing that um but I
[36:24] made the decision because I wanted to
[36:26] speak not only with my bubble if you
[36:29] only speak German your bubble is Swiss
[36:32] Austria and Germany those are not poor
[36:34] countries this is like one group of
[36:36] people uh they are kind of living uh on
[36:39] a similar standard I mean the Swiss
[36:40] frank is way better than the Euro but
[36:43] it's like it's it's it's it's similar
[36:46] system and similar people and right and
[36:49] so let me let me interrupt you for one
[36:50] second why is the
[36:53] Swiss frank better than the
[36:56] euro I mean for me the Swiss frank is
[36:59] one of the best coins there is they
[37:04] they were also the last one that got off
[37:07] the gold uh like they were the longest
[37:09] that they kept on the gold one I think
[37:11] 90 was it 1990 something like that
[37:14] really close to the near future the near
[37:17] present exactly and every time in
[37:22] Switzerland I spend a lot of time in
[37:23] Switzerland I have some um Family
[37:26] offices that I visit and some friends
[37:28] over
[37:29] there I find it
[37:32] fascinating when we have this
[37:34] conversation and they tell me that you
[37:38] know the Swiss government um I guess
[37:40] it's uh there's six different regions uh
[37:43] they they I have this totally wrong but
[37:46] I'm what I'm really getting at is that
[37:48] when
[37:49] they when the government says hey we
[37:52] want to go spend money and we want to go
[37:54] do
[37:55] this people all come together and they
[38:00] vote the vote is in the hands of the
[38:02] people whether or
[38:05] not money gets allocated to certain
[38:10] things right that money doesn't get
[38:12] allocated inside of a 6,000 page
[38:15] document that no one reads and 482
[38:18] lawyers wrote at $600 an hour right like
[38:22] that is not how it
[38:25] works and so you know yeah they do have
[38:28] the strongest I mean they they take a
[38:30] lot of pride in that they have not
[38:34] devalued their currency it's a very
[38:37] strong
[38:39] currency and
[38:41] it's go ahead I had yesterday actually a
[38:45] a politician from the Swiss on my
[38:46] podcast so it's two for those listening
[38:49] and want to see that it's two podcasts
[38:52] uh before that one and Samuel kulman and
[38:56] uh he he talked about and I was
[38:59] interested in what is about the
[39:01] political system in Swiss uh special and
[39:04] there's one thing that no one else has
[39:07] they're having a team of leaders it's
[39:09] not one that's leading Swiss it's like I
[39:13] think seven people he said there's
[39:15] always one
[39:16] representing uh those group of people
[39:19] but they have the equal uh voting rights
[39:21] like there have I think he said seven uh
[39:24] and it's not one leader like the
[39:26] American president and like every almost
[39:29] every country uh it seems like there's
[39:32] one guy that that guides the way I think
[39:35] in Austria it's also like that and of
[39:38] course the direct democracy uh it's from
[39:40] from Top town and this is why also so
[39:43] many um great things in Bitcoin adoption
[39:46] are happening in the Swiss we having
[39:49] with Lugano a city where so much
[39:52] adoption is happening because the mayor
[39:54] decided to to drive that adoption and
[39:57] people did they DFT the adoption there
[39:58] Canon souk uh there are so many um great
[40:02] things happening you can pay taxes even
[40:05] in Bitcoin I had a interview with Beach
[40:08] Bitcoin they are not even having a bank
[40:10] account they only have a Bitcoin wallet
[40:12] and they can they are legally uh they
[40:15] are normal legal firm in the Swiss
[40:18] without a bank account how amazing is
[40:20] that is that even possible in America I
[40:22] don't I know it's not possible in
[40:26] Austria but it's it's great money bus it
[40:30] is
[40:32] okay it
[40:35] is
[40:36] and in
[40:39] Switzerland I mean they uh you know they
[40:43] their Community basically looked at
[40:45] crypto or looked at the digital assets
[40:47] space and said okay we don't know where
[40:51] all of this goes but let's get together
[40:54] and let's establish best practices
[41:00] and they were very forward thinking of
[41:03] you know building a community building
[41:05] an
[41:08] ecosystem in order to to approach this
[41:12] logically and let the
[41:14] technology do its thing right instead of
[41:18] like regulate regulate regulate prohibit
[41:21] the technology from growing it's like
[41:24] all right we we know this is coming so
[41:26] let's
[41:27] incubate and let's figure out what the
[41:29] best practices
[41:31] are that is the
[41:34] way I mean what isn't the way is
[41:38] Elizabeth Warren what isn't the way is
[41:42] Jamie Diamond going on
[41:44] TV and you know saying oh if I were the
[41:48] government I'd shut this
[41:51] down those two people are a threat to
[41:53] National
[41:55] Security of the United
[41:58] States because they don't understand the
[42:02] technology they don't understand where
[42:05] the landscape
[42:06] is they are completely Mis representing
[42:10] the
[42:11] truth they want the world to continue to
[42:16] see uh you know they it see things uh
[42:21] under the guys that they've
[42:24] created and it's just it's just it's
[42:27] factually it's
[42:29] dangerous you know I I again like to
[42:32] just briefly get back to the energy guys
[42:34] the other conversation that I the Avenue
[42:37] that I often try
[42:39] to um establish with them is look you're
[42:43] in the energy business you drill you
[42:46] drill for oil you bring natural
[42:47] resources natural resources out of the
[42:50] ground would you say that by doing so
[42:53] with you know domestic energy production
[42:56] would you say that is a facet of
[42:59] National
[43:00] Security the answer is always
[43:04] yes okay
[43:07] so do you think that grid
[43:12] stabilization is also key to National
[43:16] Security the answer is always
[43:20] yes okay so if Bitcoin mining helps us
[43:25] stabilize the grid
[43:28] would you say that Bitcoin mining is an
[43:30] aspect of National
[43:32] Security the answer yes I mean they may
[43:36] not say it's yes but it's yes and to
[43:39] take that one step
[43:40] further
[43:42] mean cyber security is
[43:47] increasingly prevalent in in everywhere
[43:51] right the the the discussion around
[43:54] cyber security I mean again how are we
[43:57] securing our our
[44:01] networks how how do we protect them I
[44:05] don't really know what the answer to
[44:06] that looks like but I do know that the
[44:09] way that
[44:10] we've tried in the past has not worked
[44:13] we still have hacks we still have
[44:15] natural gas pipelines that are being
[44:16] hacked we still
[44:18] have Twitter being hacked um you know
[44:22] Gary gendler's tweet the SEC releasing
[44:26] the ETF thing like that was hacked
[44:28] like something's got to give and it
[44:32] seems like if you have a
[44:35] hardened computer network that is
[44:39] secured by enormous amounts of
[44:42] computational power and is
[44:45] expensive to secure like that has to be
[44:48] part of it right yes and this is
[44:52] something uh I come from it security and
[44:54] now I'm working full-time in Bitcoin but
[44:57] just 18 days ago I was still working at
[45:01] a cyber security company so I saw it day
[45:05] by day which big companies which uh uh
[45:09] companies individuals even uh got hacked
[45:12] and lost a lot of money and if you and
[45:14] with Bitcoin you now have the
[45:16] possibility to basically have a setup
[45:19] that is
[45:20] 99.999% sure Bitcoin is 100% uh secure
[45:25] but your own setup because you have to
[45:28] keep your your keys yourself you can
[45:31] make it even almost impossible to hack
[45:35] no no system is 100% secure but uh you
[45:39] can always make it so secure with multi
[45:42] signatures with different locations with
[45:44] so many uh things going on um that that
[45:48] is almost impossible to uh uh hack a
[45:51] bank account but how easy is it compared
[45:54] to that to actually hack a bank account
[45:57] it's like uh the we see so many examples
[46:00] where the CEO uses the password for
[46:02] everything and they're in sloppy they
[46:04] don't have two Factor identification
[46:06] they don't have the the the basics of it
[46:09] security not in their company and they
[46:10] cannot enforce it and I had with it
[46:13] security um leaders of big companies a
[46:16] lot of discussions and the thing they
[46:18] struggle with is enforcing the basics on
[46:21] the companies so all the big companies
[46:24] if you're motivated you can get in them
[46:27] like it's sometimes not even hard uh and
[46:31] taking Bitcoin uh to at least secure the
[46:35] financial side at least secure the the
[46:38] balance sheet is a big step of that uh
[46:41] of course the the systems can still get
[46:43] hacked and I don't know if Bitcoin is
[46:44] the answer or can provide an answer I
[46:46] don't think so uh but uh at least the
[46:49] financial side could be secured with
[46:51] with Bitcoin so I I see a lot of
[46:53] potential there um for uh the the next
[46:57] question I have a little bit of a
[46:59] questions in Bitcoin mining I don't know
[47:01] if if you have made yourself thoughts
[47:05] about that it's just came up in my mind
[47:07] um we talked about Bitcoin mining and uh
[47:11] Bitcoin mining now it's like only for
[47:14] big companies but we see also those um
[47:18] adventurous guys and girls that are in
[47:21] the own seller and making some Bitcoin
[47:24] mining experiment and have like one two
[47:27] Miners And like I don't know warm up
[47:29] their pool or something like that uh do
[47:32] you see the where do you see the the
[47:34] future of Bitcoin mining do we have a
[47:36] chance to like decentralize it with like
[47:39] cool gadgets that you just like heat
[47:41] your own house with it heat your pool
[47:43] with it uh put like a solar roof on on
[47:45] top and then uh get with the additional
[47:50] uh energy that you have from the solar
[47:51] roof maybe you don't need the whole
[47:53] energy you need that you get from that
[47:56] and you can use it monetize it with
[47:58] Bitcoin um do you have like an opinion
[48:00] where Bitcoin mining in general is going
[48:04] do does it get decentralized does it get
[48:06] like only big companies do we have those
[48:09] gadgets uh do we have like an vision for
[48:13] that yeah
[48:16] um I I think there's a few there's a few
[48:19] things I'd say first of
[48:22] all My overall thesis that every bit
[48:26] every company gets into Bitcoin mining
[48:30] eventually and so you know I live in a
[48:32] high-rise building we have a huge
[48:35] physical plant in our basement you know
[48:38] water heaters and all all sorts of stuff
[48:41] right there is excess heat that's being
[48:46] generated down in my basement I'm not a
[48:49] technical person but I would say there's
[48:52] a way to incorporate Bitcoin mining as a
[48:54] part of our system I think every
[48:56] building that's built
[48:58] starting in about 10 years has Bitcoin
[49:00] miners as a part of a physical plan I've
[49:03] heard people say Bitcoin miners will be
[49:05] inside of
[49:06] cars but to your question do I think
[49:09] that it's only the big companies that
[49:10] get into Bitcoin
[49:12] mining I
[49:14] mean I think it's harder for the Bitcoin
[49:17] miners every single day because they
[49:19] have to go find power they have to find
[49:23] a power source and it has to be
[49:27] uh reliable right it has to be steady
[49:30] and it needs to be and by Steady I mean
[49:33] they have to have access to it um it it
[49:36] can't be uh um you know it works only on
[49:41] Sundays I mean I guess that works but I
[49:44] mean for the economics to really work
[49:45] out it it needs to be a reliable
[49:50] source but again I mean the energy
[49:52] companies are sitting on these assets
[49:55] that they aren't even aware
[49:58] that they can integrate Bitcoin mining
[50:01] and and basically add tremendous
[50:06] value to their companies just by
[50:09] integrating Bitcoin mining and I won't
[50:12] give you um maybe you can have me back
[50:14] on in a couple of months and we can talk
[50:15] about something else I'm working on
[50:18] compensated to work on something but I I
[50:20] have knowledge of a really cool project
[50:22] that I hope will be announced um that's
[50:25] a very large
[50:28] scale use case of somebody in energy
[50:33] who's taking assets that are not being
[50:36] used and it's going to start mining
[50:38] Bitcoin and like that their specific
[50:41] business model is repeatable at scale
[50:45] like it's one of the most obvious things
[50:48] but people in the energy space still
[50:50] listen to Elizabeth Warren and all the
[50:52] nuts on Fox News and they're not
[50:55] thinking about it from a value ad
[50:57] perspective to their own
[51:00] businesses
[51:01] so I think the energy companies figure
[51:04] it out I think the miners obviously have
[51:07] figured it out right and their their
[51:09] hunt for power is on I mean I talk to
[51:12] people every day who are putting minors
[51:13] into their
[51:14] house or they
[51:17] are calling up uh simple mining Compass
[51:22] SAS mining they're calling up somebody
[51:24] you know Bob Bernett is doing hosting at
[51:26] ver
[51:27] Mining and they've now got a Bitcoin
[51:30] miner or two or five or 80 being hosted
[51:33] for them or you've
[51:37] got um I have two friends who have um
[51:40] gas Wells and they're relatively new
[51:43] into the mining space and they've got
[51:46] Wells where they thought they were going
[51:48] to have to plug them they're not huge
[51:51] volumes of
[51:52] gas um you know it would probably be
[51:55] $40,000 for them to plug the well and
[51:58] there's kind of a time frame there is a
[52:00] time frame that's attached to um how
[52:03] long you can have it sitting there and
[52:05] your liability for plugging it and
[52:09] they're reaching that point and now
[52:11] they've discovered Bitcoin mining and
[52:12] they're like oh wait I can call Steve
[52:15] Barber at Upstream data and get a hash
[52:17] Hut here you know a little shipping
[52:19] container on my
[52:20] site and I can mine Bitcoin right or
[52:24] Giga energy same thing let me call Giga
[52:26] they'll come set this
[52:28] up so many people who own oil and gas
[52:32] assets are going to start coming into
[52:35] this so whether or not it's one guy with
[52:37] one well or if
[52:40] it's you know a huge Midstream company
[52:44] in the energy space like everyone
[52:46] eventually comes to Bitcoin
[52:48] mining it's the tool for the
[52:52] future that's amazing I think this is a
[52:56] a wonderful point to uh get to the end
[52:58] of our podcast we approaching the one
[53:00] hour it's it Flow by really quickly uh
[53:04] again um uh before we get to our end
[53:07] routine where the previous guest is
[53:09] asking a question for the next guest uh
[53:11] and I'm really interested in that
[53:13] hearing your answer to that I have one
[53:15] question that uh uh because I listen to
[53:19] people that are on podcast and they're
[53:21] coming on my podcast and usually it's
[53:23] it's hard for me to like find new
[53:26] question questions and have like
[53:28] interesting angles of of things you
[53:30] might already have said uh that's why I
[53:32] wanted to ask you is there something you
[53:35] never shared on a podcast but you always
[53:37] wanted to
[53:42] share yes and maybe when will this air
[53:46] like soon in uh two
[53:48] weeks okay so maybe this is good timing
[53:52] um I am going to give a talk at bit
[53:54] block boom and Gary Leeland B black boom
[53:57] gave it a really interesting title it's
[53:59] like something like how to raise
[54:01] non-conforming kids in a conforming
[54:03] world or something oh really cool
[54:06] um you know I feel really passionately
[54:09] that uh our kids are under too much
[54:12] pressure and it's up to parents to you
[54:14] know twist the release valve and
[54:17] decrease the
[54:18] pressure
[54:20] and we as bitcoiners reject the
[54:24] narrative that the dollar
[54:27] is stable that the dollar is the future
[54:30] like we reject these
[54:34] narratives we also need
[54:37] to uh not need to I don't want to give
[54:39] someone advice but I wish people would
[54:44] consider that The Narrative of regular
[54:48] [Music]
[54:50] schooling isn't the only
[54:52] way right and I understand not everybody
[54:55] can homeschool I didn't home school I
[54:58] asked Ella to drop out of school
[54:59] basically her whole life I was like oh
[55:01] hang out let's come you know let's you
[55:03] should be home school we'd have so much
[55:05] fun and um and Ella was like Mom we
[55:09] would not do anything we would cook all
[55:11] day and we would take walks and I have
[55:13] to learn and you know I mean it's this
[55:15] kind of running joke
[55:17] but so she did go to regular school um
[55:21] which I almost got her kicked out of a
[55:23] couple of times because I was parents
[55:27] that rejected all sorts of that
[55:30] they did with our
[55:31] kids and you know she went to a all
[55:35] girls catholic school and the nuns were
[55:38] you know this is the way you do things
[55:40] your hair bow has to be dark green it
[55:43] can't be lime green I was
[55:45] like like the amount of stress that we
[55:49] put on our kids for things that do not
[55:53] matter must stop because
[55:57] what we're doing is we're filling their
[55:59] brains with first of all we our schools
[56:03] tell kids how to think they tell them
[56:06] what to think not how to think and so
[56:08] it's our job as parents to say wait you
[56:13] know H what do you think of this right
[56:17] like let's stop and think about what the
[56:23] prescribed um I use this example
[56:25] occasion do you know what baking soda is
[56:29] like that you use to bake with it comes
[56:30] in like a little yellow box here in the
[56:32] US uh yes I probably I know it but I
[56:37] don't know the English word for
[56:39] it I I need to have like a box of it on
[56:41] my desk because I do give this example
[56:43] so in the US the baking soda um when you
[56:49] add a teaspoon or half teaspoon or two
[56:51] teaspoons it it helps activate um when
[56:56] you're baking like you you add it and it
[56:58] makes things rise a chemical process I
[57:01] should probably get smarter on
[57:04] but okay well you don't use very much
[57:06] baking soda when you use it a half a
[57:08] teaspoon at a time right in a
[57:10] recipe and so some marketing genius said
[57:14] hey let's tell people to throw it down
[57:16] their sink and it'll make their drain
[57:18] smell better in their kitchen so you get
[57:21] the box of baking soda it's 89 cents you
[57:24] go to the store you buy the 889 Cent box
[57:26] you rip the whole top off you dump it
[57:28] down your drain you add a little bit of
[57:30] water and you let it sit there and then
[57:32] it reduces the
[57:33] odors okay that was the
[57:39] marketing like that is now taken as
[57:41] gospel that that
[57:44] works it's like guys that was a
[57:46] marketing deal right like some marketing
[57:49] guy realized they weren't selling enough
[57:51] and created a use case and out told us
[57:53] all that this is why we have to have it
[57:55] in our makes our refrigerator smell
[57:57] better it makes our drains smell better
[57:59] like this was
[58:02] marketing so I would say like with our
[58:07] kids let's think about what we're
[58:09] actually asking them to believe is it
[58:11] even
[58:13] true and
[58:16] so like I said i' and I'm going to talk
[58:18] about this at b boom I got Ella kicked
[58:20] out a couple of times they never
[58:21] actually kicked her out but they really
[58:23] wanted to her dad always smooth
[58:27] over um but I rejected the food at the
[58:30] school I didn't want her to have to eat
[58:32] the school food it was um I did a
[58:37] ton of study on what it was she'd never
[58:40] felt well when she'd come home from
[58:42] school it took me like six months of
[58:45] arguing with them and like meeting with
[58:48] every person meeting with the head of
[58:50] the cafeteria Marcela this who was
[58:52] actually wonderful um meeting with the
[58:55] you know
[58:57] sister nun dun who was the head nun like
[59:01] and finally they said well okay fine you
[59:03] don't have to feed her our food but you
[59:05] still have to pay for the food but you
[59:06] can send her
[59:07] lunch I was like okay like I I was like
[59:12] the parent that kept saying wait I
[59:14] reject the fact that you're making
[59:17] her you know whatever it is this crap
[59:21] that we waste time on they they forced
[59:24] feed her like uh you like if if there
[59:28] like it's not even that you wanted to
[59:30] change cafeteria menu it's like they
[59:33] they could not even uh um say like oh I
[59:36] just eat my own stuff this was not
[59:38] allowed in the school it was not allowed
[59:40] to bring your own lunch until until like
[59:44] ever and the school has been around for
[59:45] 52 years you could not bring your own
[59:49] lunch until I went through this entire
[59:52] thing and then and then Ella would show
[59:56] show up with her lunch kit and sit down
[59:58] at the lunch table and the other kids
[60:00] would be like why are you bringing your
[60:02] own
[60:03] lunch what
[60:05] happened like she had some illness and
[60:09] it's like guys the food is garbage
[60:13] literally garbage they spend less than a
[60:15] dollar a day to feed our kids and it is
[60:19]  and guess what happened then a
[60:22] whole bunch of people started bringing
[60:24] their own
[60:25] lunch
[60:26] like so I would say we all need to think
[60:30] about the kids that we're trying
[60:33] to bitcoin is Hope Bitcoin is the tool
[60:36] we need for the future but we've got to
[60:39] empower our kids to think differently
[60:42] and that starts in second grade right or
[60:46] kindergarten when they go to
[60:48] school starts right there you know this
[60:52] whole I I mean I could go in an entire
[60:54] tangent but like the whole oh your kid
[60:56] has to be in the in the stem program you
[60:59] know science technology whatever that is
[61:02] such a narrative like those
[61:04] classes aren't great I mean you've put a
[61:08] fancy label on them I'm not saying
[61:10] they're terrible but
[61:12] like rather than have your kid in a
[61:15] class with a narrative
[61:19] name give your kid the ability to take a
[61:22] history class and actually consider
[61:25] what's being taught thought as did this
[61:27] really happen is this really
[61:31] Truth uh you know I
[61:35] mean teach them that they have the power
[61:39] to think for themselves and they can
[61:42] reject anything that they're told they
[61:46] can reject it I don't you know that may
[61:48] be true I'm going to go think about this
[61:50] and do my own work and try and prove to
[61:53] myself that it's true because we ask
[61:55] kids to memorize information we ask kids
[61:58] to accept what we tell them as absolute
[62:01] truth and then yet we want to have kids
[62:05] who change the
[62:06] world those two things don't work they
[62:09] can't that can't work together you have
[62:11] to give your kids the power to think
[62:15] differently when they're in kindergarten
[62:17] or first grade second grade and and
[62:21] repeat repeat the message to them I
[62:24] value what you think
[62:27] right like let your kids I I call I will
[62:30] end with this I called Ella
[62:32] yesterday I had been traveling I got off
[62:34] an airplane
[62:36] I my dad's in the hospital I went to see
[62:39] my dad I finally got back to my house
[62:42] and I called Ella and I said how are you
[62:44] what are you doing and she said oh I'm
[62:46] good I said well how was your day and
[62:48] she said I was good I said what' you do
[62:50] and she said well I've been here
[62:54] thinking
[62:56] really
[62:58] cool who says that most 20-year-old kids
[63:01] are like oh my God I'm studying for this
[63:03] I'm so stressed out my friend isn't
[63:06] doing this I had a problem with my car
[63:09] my LA and Ella goes oh I've just been
[63:12] here
[63:13] thinking like that is a total win as a
[63:17] parent
[63:19] yeah there the absolute win and I think
[63:22] this is this touches on so many aspects
[63:24] and now and I think we we will just do
[63:27] in a few months second round not go over
[63:30] length here uh but I just wanted to add
[63:33] I think critical thinking like just
[63:35] sitting down and thinking of the stuff
[63:38] because we are all we tend to be
[63:41] obsessed with the things we're doing so
[63:43] much that we stopped thinking about the
[63:46] things we actually doing if this made if
[63:48] this sentence made sense but it's like
[63:51] um we're doing it we're doing it we're
[63:52] doing it but we're not stopping
[63:55] somewhere like what are we actually
[63:56] doing and does this make sense uh does
[63:59] the food we eat make sense does the
[64:01] money we use make sense does the the the
[64:04] places we go make sense uh are the like
[64:08] and this is a thing which which is
[64:10] amazing to see in the Bitcoin Community
[64:12] because we now early that everyone that
[64:14] is in this Bitcoin Community had to
[64:16] critical think about money so naturally
[64:19] the questions about uh other things and
[64:22] this is why homeschooling is so popular
[64:24] also in the Bitcoin Community because
[64:26] they questions not only money they also
[64:28] question the education system uh and
[64:31] yeah this is amazing thing to see in the
[64:33] Bitcoin community and that's why I just
[64:36] love speaking with with bitcoiners I
[64:38] have this this mission to interview 300
[64:40] bitcoiners this year uh I'm now at 74 so
[64:44] I'm I'm I'm going
[64:46] good uh and uh yeah let's let's come to
[64:50] an end uh let's have a second round
[64:52] somehow uh maybe later this year uh and
[64:55] our end routine is where the previous
[64:57] guest asks a question for the next guest
[65:00] I love this so much because other it's
[65:02] like the blockchain it connects the
[65:03] guests to each other and it brings a
[65:05] question in that is not from myself uh
[65:09] and it brings in always a question that
[65:11] is like completely random because they
[65:13] don't even know who the next guest is uh
[65:16] and uh the person is really passionate
[65:19] right now about micro strategy and about
[65:22] the short squeeze that could happen in
[65:24] micro strategy stock
[65:27] and that's why he asked uh do you own
[65:30] micro strategy stock and why
[65:34] not uh I do own micro strategy
[65:38] stock so it's it's a why not why
[65:43] not is there a reason why you own it uh
[65:46] additionally to to bitcoin do you want
[65:48] to contribute to a short a potential
[65:50] short short
[65:52] squeeze no I I don't want to contribute
[65:54] to any short squeeze
[65:57] uh I own it because I have an IRA
[65:59] account and I want exposure to um I I
[66:05] would like to continue with uh being
[66:08] irresponsibly long Bitcoin I don't want
[66:11] to own any other equities
[66:13] I uh do believe that Bitcoin uh
[66:17] demonetizes value from all other assets
[66:21] including you know Jim Kramer's favorite
[66:24] you don't trade Apple you own Apple
[66:26] forever you know BS like if you look at
[66:28] the history of the S&P the top 10
[66:31] country companies within the S&P over
[66:33] the last 50 years um there's very little
[66:36] translation decade to decade uh so I
[66:39] bought micro
[66:41] strategy in my Roth
[66:43] IRA um you know as an expression of my
[66:47] adoration for Bitcoin yeah that makes
[66:50] total sense uh thank you Lisa for for
[66:52] being on thank you for speaking today h
[66:54] it was a pleasure having you uh is if
[66:57] there if people have question about you
[66:59] if people have question about the topics
[67:02] we talked about today where can people
[67:03] reach you where can people ask you
[67:05] questions yeah I'm on Twitter and I'm on
[67:08] LinkedIn one of the favorite my favorite
[67:10] things that I get to do every week is I
[67:12] always offer to speak with with folks
[67:15] that are trying to get into Bitcoin or
[67:17] if you have questions about Bitcoin or
[67:18] Bitcoin mining or um anything that I do
[67:21] I I can do to help you contribute to
[67:24] your journey please please reach out um
[67:26] I do book a few of these kind of
[67:28] 15minute sessions with folks if you
[67:31] reach out I I will schedule a 15minute
[67:33] session with you it's it's really my
[67:35] greatest privilege to hear what other
[67:36] people are working on really cool uh
[67:39] thank you and I appreciate your time
[67:47] thanks
