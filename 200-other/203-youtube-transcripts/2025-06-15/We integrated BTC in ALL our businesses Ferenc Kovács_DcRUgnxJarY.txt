[00:00] we are stared to use Bitcoin as the tool
[00:02] in in our businesses tomorrow we
[00:04] introduce Bitcoin payments in our hotels
[00:07] it's the first Revolution where you gain
[00:10] Financial purchasing power with it if
[00:12] you buy a rental or buy a coffee or buy
[00:15] a holiday with Bitcoin it's completely
[00:17] okay and U I'm also paying with Bitcoin
[00:20] whenever I can do you think there's an
[00:22] active war on privacy right now is a
[00:24] nation state in the digital
[00:26] world is there anything you don't like
[00:30] like about Bitcoin is there anything
[00:32] that you are not satisfied with Bitcoin
[00:35] is there anything you like ah this
[00:37] aspect could be improved that this
[00:38] aspect is like not uh could be bad off
[00:42] uh or is it always like a trade-off
[00:44] because the bad things should be there
[00:46] because otherwise it's it's like yeah
[00:48] sure um you know when you um studed
[00:52] Bitcoin you you you learn why is block
[00:55] time is important why is 10 minutes
[00:58] important why is energy important
[01:00] so there are this is these are the main
[01:03] characteristics of Bitcoin and it's
[01:05] really important maybe uh maybe the nfts
[01:08] on bitcoin and runes are I think
[01:12] useless um some stuff on uh good chain
[01:16] like Bitcoin is necessary like if we if
[01:19] you need an ID I would like to be my ID
[01:22] on the best chain possible if if I if we
[01:26] tokenize whenever or uh or or house or
[01:31] car or something I would like to be the
[01:34] best chain to be tokenized it uh but I
[01:37] don't know how this U possible or is it
[01:40] going to be but uh runes are think it's
[01:44] useless but uh every other aspects of
[01:46] Bitcoin I I understand that I like it
[01:49] it's okay yeah and I feel like you
[01:52] always have the Oracle problem when you
[01:54] put something on the blockchain like who
[01:56] who puts it on like who who's the one
[01:59] puts it on in face this is the the main
[02:01] thing and you also put a uh videos out
[02:04] online I saw some unfortunately most of
[02:07] them I don't understand because I don't
[02:08] speak your local language yes uh but I
[02:10] saw some some videos of you uh and what
[02:13] what did you get more did you motivated
[02:16] to do that like uh Beyond Bitcoin but
[02:18] also speaking about it online yeah sure
[02:21] so I started using U social media about
[02:25] U more than a year now and I usually
[02:28] update uh upload videos about my life
[02:30] about uh my business uh about my
[02:33] perspectives on lives and uh
[02:35] businesses uh you know I have multiple
[02:38] businesses I have a construction company
[02:40] we produce pias concrete elements and I
[02:43] have two fourstar hotels uh we
[02:47] rebuilding uh residential buildings
[02:50] Flats so a lot of things and I have uh
[02:55] some point of view may be interesting to
[02:57] other people or other businessmen in
[02:59] Hungary
[03:00] uh I usually post uh in the morning when
[03:03] I get up and uh make some Runnings at
[03:06] 3:00 a.m. run or 400 a.m. run
[03:09] hashtag yeah maybe you you saw it or not
[03:13] but um I usually get up early not every
[03:16] day uh but um usually two or three or
[03:19] four times a week um I get up at 3 or
[03:22] 4:00 to run about 10
[03:25] kilometers and uh just meditating my
[03:29] stuff my thoughts uh have a SAA after
[03:32] that and and and I need that two or
[03:35] three hours to prepare uh the the next
[03:39] day or something I would like to
[03:42] consider and my best uh best thoughts
[03:45] and best uh ideas come between 3:00 a.m.
[03:49] to 5:00 a.m. so it's it's an interesting
[03:51] one a lot of people U try to catch up me
[03:55] uh and follow my leadership about
[03:58] running and healthy life I'm not an
[04:00] expert I'm just an engineer but uh I
[04:03] know that uh Health life needs movement
[04:07] you need to move your body you need to
[04:09] use your
[04:10] body and uh I would like to do it the
[04:14] most consistent way if if I if I would
[04:17] like to train in the afternoon um my
[04:20] family my business work or other stuffs
[04:23] maybe interrupt it and it it wouldn't be
[04:26] possible so the the most most uh
[04:32] uninterrupted day of my life is my
[04:34] morning that's my decision to get up
[04:36] early or not if if my decision I can do
[04:40] it if I want to it so yeah I'm trying
[04:44] like everybody else and
[04:47] U uh I speak about this uh topic so with
[04:52] short videos and uh and I uh made lot of
[04:55] videos about Bitcoin in the past half
[04:58] year because a lot of folks uh talk to
[05:02] me in person that fer what's this
[05:04] Bitcoin is about how is it working uh
[05:08] what will be the price um and and I and
[05:10] I started to catch it up uh this topic
[05:13] because people interested in about it
[05:16] I'm in the Bitcoin space uh from
[05:18] 2018 and I study Bitcoin and study uh
[05:23] charts and an analytics and Phil
[05:26] philosophy I read books uh regularly
[05:29] every day
[05:30] my kids always laugh at me when I uh
[05:33] when when I'm when I am on charge and I
[05:36] would like to put something on the TV
[05:38] and my child always talk to me like okay
[05:42] Daddy but don't Bitcoin
[05:45] please because we are uh we are we are
[05:48] full of that so I I really usually
[05:52] listen to podcasts and and Bitcoin
[05:54] related topics so uh a lot of hungarians
[05:58] had a language
[06:00] barrier they don't really understand
[06:03] English and uh if they understand
[06:05] English it's not they are not so
[06:07] familiar with the language to uh make
[06:10] decisions about it how to invest their
[06:13] money hungarians had a lot of uh
[06:16] downside with investing in money they
[06:20] hungarians don't really do this
[06:22] hungarians don't have um such a wide
[06:25] range of uh
[06:28] investment philosophy like uh like
[06:30] Western countries do so a lot of people
[06:34] don't uh don't use trading in Hungary
[06:36] don't invest in stock markets they
[06:39] invest uh maybe sometimes gold with
[06:42] jeweles but they are really expensive so
[06:47] a lot of my talks are about uh are about
[06:52] this that Bitcoin is uh um savings
[06:55] technology a savings
[06:58] account you can invest you can trade it
[07:01] you can have a lot of money with Bitcoin
[07:04] trading like trading Nvidia stock or
[07:06] Facebook stock or MST stock but Bitcoin
[07:11] is a savings technology you can use it
[07:12] as a savings
[07:14] technology and so so I so I so I have
[07:18] lot of videos about
[07:20] this I love it and this is a great topic
[07:23] do you also integrate it in you said you
[07:25] have a multiple businesses do you
[07:28] integrate those as all also on the
[07:30] balance sheet or in other ways yes yes
[07:33] uh some things are U ahead us we are
[07:38] starting to use U Bitcoin as uh as a
[07:40] tool in in our
[07:42] businesses um tomorrow at uh one day
[07:45] after the pizza day um we introduce
[07:49] Bitcoin payments in our hotels one of
[07:52] our hotels at mishod um it's a fourstar
[07:56] hotel we accept Bitcoin with lightning
[07:59] we have have managed to uh talk about
[08:02] the the lawyers and the cants about it
[08:05] and everything is fine so uh we will
[08:09] accept Bitcoin in our photos and you can
[08:11] rent flats from us uh with Bitcoin uh in
[08:16] the later of the Year from R of the year
[08:19] but that's my intention that uh every
[08:22] businesses I have they will invest 1% of
[08:26] uh their income
[08:30] uh to the balance sheet uh we will buy
[08:32] Bitcoin and we will hold that Bitcoin uh
[08:35] stack for 8 to 10
[08:38] years that's a great great Mission
[08:41] because when they when they hold it long
[08:43] term uh they actually benefit the most
[08:45] like you you have to hold at least four
[08:48] to five years to really get the
[08:50] advantages of Bitcoin Bitcoin is nothing
[08:51] thing for short term and you also
[08:53] mentioned uh the betza the global B
[08:56] Bitcoin betza there which is fascinating
[08:58] for me that everybody is having pizza
[09:00] there there are some restaurants even
[09:02] that if you mention Bitcoin you get free
[09:04] pizza like there there are a lot of
[09:07] interesting things happening around the
[09:09] world with Bitcoin beta day and I think
[09:11] is the importance of Bitcoin beta day is
[09:13] like just starting out now um but what
[09:17] is it for you like what what is the
[09:18] importance for for the pizza Bitcoin
[09:20] Pizza there especially when we think of
[09:22] like how important is it to spend your
[09:24] Bitcoin for a global
[09:26] adoption yeah I think um you know know
[09:29] mosor said don't sell your Bitcoin but
[09:32] he said also that use your Bitcoin when
[09:35] when you want to so I always encourage
[09:38] people to hold their Bitcoin stack but
[09:42] uh but maybe we can share to others so
[09:46] spending Bitcoin like a one 1,000 1% or
[09:51] uh a perc a fraction of a person is it's
[09:55] it's fully okay so uh if if you if you
[09:58] uh Buy buy a rental or or buy a coffee
[10:02] or uh buy a holiday holiday with Bitcoin
[10:05] it's I think it's it's it's completely
[10:08] okay and U I'm also paying with Bitcoin
[10:12] whenever I can so I I order books with
[10:14] Bitcoin and I for example I I ordered
[10:18] coin IED P terminals Bitcoin P terminals
[10:21] with Bitcoin also so I use it as a I try
[10:26] to use it as a daily life and my kids
[10:28] pocket money is also so in Bitcoin so my
[10:31] charts seven and 14 are in 100% in
[10:36] Bitcoin their pocket money is in Bitcoin
[10:39] and we and we uh transact we make
[10:41] transactions between us in lightning
[10:44] with blink
[10:46] wallet that's that's really cool um one
[10:49] thing on on the company side I'm I'm
[10:51] curious about because I see a lot of
[10:54] entrepreneurs uh and startup creaders
[10:57] being in crypto but not like especially
[11:00] in Bitcoin like there are a lot of this
[11:02] oh blockchain Innovation crypto
[11:04] tokenization and all this stuff which I
[11:07] think is kind of uh but
[11:10] everybody has has his own things um as I
[11:13] understand it you are Bitcoin only you
[11:15] also don't like the runes and the nfts
[11:17] on top of Bitcoin um what made it click
[11:20] for you like what why did you didn't go
[11:24] the the crypto route and why did you
[11:26] focus on on bitcoin only what was like
[11:28] Bitcoin and what what made Bitcoin so
[11:30] attractive for you at the first year
[11:33] some gut feeling about
[11:35] security I I I don't at 2018 I didn't
[11:39] understand Bitcoin as well as now and
[11:42] after I heard Michael sailor's uh
[11:45] podcast and uh other people's like uh
[11:49] Bitcoin standard book I I read the
[11:50] Bitcoin standard book and and I
[11:52] understand uh that Bitcoin how Bitcoin
[11:55] is safe how can it be
[11:57] safe um and and um the other blockchains
[12:01] are are not Bitcoin because of the
[12:04] starting of the blockchain they are for
[12:06] profit on or or they I like some
[12:09] technology company so eum is fine but it
[12:13] not for not for money it's I think it's
[12:15] technology
[12:17] company definitely definitely H one
[12:20] thing that you said also before that I'm
[12:21] still curious about uh you said you're
[12:23] waking up early and I'm also big
[12:26] believer in waking up early uh
[12:28] especially if like obviously there are
[12:29] different types of persons uh but I
[12:32] think most people would benefit from
[12:34] waking up early uh and I love it I
[12:38] usually stand up 56 I think like 3 four
[12:41] is a lot is very
[12:43] extreme but but but it's it's it's still
[12:46] nice um you said two times a week or or
[12:50] I I every day or three or four times a
[12:53] week maybe and and the rest sometimes
[12:55] two sometimes four rest it's 5:00 you
[12:59] know I I'm an early person from my
[13:01] childhood but um I I um go to bed early
[13:06] as well so my child has to wake up at
[13:09] before just before 3:00 a.m. so so sorry
[13:13] my child have to get up at before 7 a.m.
[13:18] and uh and they have to uh have to get
[13:21] some sleep so we usually go to bed
[13:24] before 10 p.m. so between 10 p.m. and uh
[13:29] 3: or 4: a.m. I have maybe five or six
[13:33] uh hours to sleep and I'm fine with it
[13:36] I'm really good sleeper so whenever I uh
[13:39] lean to lean to a bed or something I I
[13:42] can I can sleep
[13:45] instantly I love it it's it's it's
[13:47] really important uh I mean it's
[13:49] important to get the sleep in but if
[13:51] you're a good sleeper uh six hours could
[13:53] be enough I tend to like get to seven
[13:55] eight hours like I try to like get from
[13:58] uh 10 to 6: a.m. like I try to also get
[14:01] in the bed at at 10: but I usually stand
[14:03] up at 6 sometimes 5 I really like five
[14:07] but it's it's hard for me because then
[14:09] it gets late and then I'm uh I'm not
[14:12] that productive I really feel it like if
[14:14] I have only seven or six and a half
[14:15] hours like I I see that my productivity
[14:18] levels and my conscious L is is just not
[14:22] as good uh but yeah there's rarely a day
[14:26] where I wake up after 7 like this is
[14:29] really rare and six is like just the
[14:31] standard now I I love it I love it if I
[14:34] don't set up any alarms you know I I get
[14:37] up at 4:00 3:00 with alarm on on my on
[14:40] my wrist my Apple watch but I if I
[14:42] didn't set up any any alarms I usually
[14:45] wake up before 5:00 a.m. so it's natural
[14:48] to
[14:49] me wow yeah you probably do it a long
[14:52] time already right yes
[14:55] yes six years almost six years very cool
[14:59] very cool um but let's come back to the
[15:02] the Bitcoin
[15:03] bin but I just love the topic
[15:07] also um what is h we always say like
[15:10] Bitcoin fixes this Bitcoin fixes that
[15:12] what is the most important thing you
[15:15] think that Bitcoin fixes like what is
[15:17] the the main thing that uh Bitcoin is
[15:20] for I believe uh the main thing is store
[15:23] up value so um if if you don't if you
[15:27] don't have the store up value fun
[15:29] uh that money is don't don't really uh
[15:34] bother anybody so uh Bitcoin uses uh
[15:37] Bitcoin solves the store of value and
[15:40] Layer Two like lightning network is uh
[15:44] is Sol the money
[15:46] function so uh I'm really interested in
[15:50] and enthusiastic about that
[15:54] uh that fact that uh Bitcoin can be help
[15:59] full uh all of the people uh in in the
[16:02] globe so the poverty the people in
[16:04] poverty the people in the middle and
[16:06] people with high income they uses the
[16:10] same tool the Bitcoin to navigate
[16:14] through the world this uh old economic
[16:18] and uh and and money structure what we
[16:22] are put in in the later uh later uh
[16:27] dynasties or I don't know so uh so
[16:31] the so Bitcoin is uh is is a is help for
[16:35] a lot of people almost every people I
[16:39] think why do why do you think there's no
[16:42] more companies having Bitcoin like that
[16:45] I feel like it would be it's almost
[16:49] irresponsibly for a company that makes
[16:51] profits and has some cash reserves um do
[16:54] not at least put some portion of that in
[16:57] Bitcoin at least the part of it uh which
[17:00] they don't need operationally for the
[17:02] next few months and there of buiness
[17:04] that have like why why do you think they
[17:06] they still don't do it so personal
[17:09] experience is very important uh as I am
[17:12] an entrepreneur and I leading my
[17:14] businesses so I'm the CEO I'm the in
[17:16] charge and uh I know from the firstand
[17:20] that I I just want to accept Bitcoin in
[17:23] my hotels and that needs some months to
[17:26] ARR to to get everything checked
[17:29] because as a as a as a company you don't
[17:33] you you couldn't uh fail because the the
[17:38] authorities will come after you come
[17:41] after you if you are a person you can do
[17:43] whatever you want to do nothing nobody's
[17:46] bothered that you you hold Bitcoin in
[17:48] your pocket but as a company uh lot of
[17:53] authorities are watching you so you need
[17:56] extra caution and a lot of people are
[17:58] working uh in a in a company lawyers uh
[18:02] accountants so you need you have to
[18:05] convince them that uh it's possible
[18:09] because they maybe they they didn't hear
[18:12] about this so as mro said that uh if if
[18:16] a CEO is knows Bitcoin is good and
[18:18] Bitcoin is is a great investment maybe
[18:22] that's not not nearly enough to have the
[18:25] company on a on a Bitcoin standard or or
[18:28] to just to invest it because lot of
[18:30] people need to be uh need to be uh
[18:35] educated I think that that's the reason
[18:39] yeah and and there's this I believe that
[18:42] in the adoption curve uh when we hit the
[18:44] certain point we could hit that point
[18:47] where all of the sudden it goes really
[18:49] parabolic uh and because as you said
[18:52] like when only not when the only person
[18:54] is the CEO uh he has probably he could
[18:58] have a hard time uh pushing through with
[19:00] with so many other interests in in the
[19:02] company but if there's like uh half of
[19:05] the company already like is kind of in a
[19:07] Bitcoin mindset uh it's easier for him
[19:11] so the the faster we go and the faster
[19:13] we educate uh it it gets easier and
[19:16] easier over time and that's why I think
[19:18] we are still really really early on
[19:20] which is also a really interesting uh
[19:22] thing you said you you do a lot of uh
[19:24] lightning transactions with the kids uh
[19:27] and yes and play around with with that
[19:29] it's it's FAS is is is lightning for you
[19:31] the the future of payments is that is
[19:33] that like how do you see the the scaling
[19:35] of of
[19:37] Bitcoin you know yeah layer to bitcoin
[19:40] is is is I think the solution for money
[19:44] uh whether it's uh liquid or lightning
[19:46] or Fint or or whatever technology is I I
[19:49] don't uh I'm not an IT perspective guy
[19:52] so maybe some guys said that lightning
[19:55] cannot be U or has some issues about
[19:59] Global scaling you know a billion people
[20:01] Global scaling I don't know right now uh
[20:05] lightning network is sols my pocket
[20:07] money for my children they got uh 10,000
[20:10] sat ofes every week and if they wanted
[20:13] to buy something if they want to buy
[20:16] something they ask me I pay with Fiat
[20:18] but they transact me the equivalent
[20:20] value to my lightning wallet so we can
[20:23] transact with each other and I and they
[20:26] are they every time they know how much
[20:29] pocket money they have and they have
[20:31] possessed it uh every time because the
[20:33] their phones are with them always if you
[20:37] are listening to this podcast you might
[20:39] be wondering what is actually the setup
[20:41] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[20:44] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[20:46] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[20:48] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[20:50] right way let's focus on the first thing
[20:52] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[20:54] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[20:57] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[20:59] an exchange that has an own token or
[21:01] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[21:03] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[21:06] for me the best partner for that and now
[21:10] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[21:12] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[21:14] a self custody solution where you
[21:17] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[21:20] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[21:23] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[21:26] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[21:28] R and you are better than 95% of all
[21:32] Bitcoin hudders if you have more than
[21:34] ,000 in Bitcoin it's a absolutely must
[21:38] have one last thing before we get back
[21:40] to the video I'm really passionate about
[21:42] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[21:44] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[21:47] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[21:50] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[21:53] conference in whole of Europe for all
[21:55] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[21:58] this place in June for all europees it's
[22:00] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[22:03] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[22:05] to come I will do interviews there and I
[22:08] would love to meet you all there use
[22:11] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[22:13] discounts and use the links down in the
[22:16] description I love it and and we always
[22:18] have this like when we have Layer Two
[22:20] Solutions and layer three solutions we
[22:22] always going away from the main chain
[22:25] and there are a lot of people like um Fe
[22:28] that there might be attacks on layer two
[22:31] layer three that it get uh captured
[22:34] maybe even like in some sense the the
[22:37] Bitcoin ETF is a a layer two solution in
[22:40] in some sense uh do you still feel there
[22:44] could be an an an attack or and and and
[22:48] try to outban it or outlaw it or
[22:51] something like that I mean we have it
[22:52] since
[22:55] 2013 and you know the you mean the bit
[22:58] TR uh whole ecosystem out loud or some
[23:01] some other transaction
[23:03] types any any attacks actually because
[23:06] there's like the Bitcoin ETFs uh that
[23:08] could be uh captured with the Holdings
[23:12] uh they could some things there's layer
[23:14] two solutions that could do something
[23:17] there can be a lot of attack vors I'm
[23:19] just wondering are we already in the
[23:21] stage where the the state uh and the
[23:25] governments are joining us or are we
[23:27] still in the state where they kind of
[23:29] get want to get rid of Bitcoin because
[23:31] then they don't have control over the
[23:32] money I see I uh yes uh I think the ETFs
[23:37] has a high possibility that maybe they
[23:40] be
[23:41] confiscated uh and and get dollars and
[23:44] not Bitcoins from your uh investment but
[23:47] ETFs you know it's a it's a dollar to
[23:49] dooll investment so they uses Bitcoin as
[23:51] a as a as a car or a or device to to
[23:55] earn more dollars so uh the best
[23:59] investment is I think to buy Bitcoin and
[24:01] hold it for a longer time and the most
[24:04] most secure is most secure way to hold
[24:07] your Bitcoin and Hardware ballets and
[24:09] cod
[24:10] ballets um you know lightning uh I I
[24:14] don't really mind about lightning
[24:16] security as a as an ecosystem maybe they
[24:19] stopped or not because I I didn't I
[24:21] don't store it uh too much Wells there
[24:23] you know some some money for the holiday
[24:26] or buy a coffee or buy some and I always
[24:29] and always have the option to transact
[24:31] to my lightning wallet on chain if I
[24:33] needed it so uh I think uh it's just a
[24:39] it's just a pocket money for people the
[24:41] lightning but it's fast and it's you can
[24:43] you can uh use it now it's not a future
[24:47] product it's done you can use it we are
[24:50] use it at the hotel night right now so
[24:54] it's a good good thing um what you
[24:56] regard about the nation States I think
[24:59] we are we are at the brink of the start
[25:03] of
[25:04] the of the collision and uh and maybe
[25:10] uh those voters what
[25:13] are uh what are really hard for nation
[25:18] state because they are trying to stop it
[25:21] uh or or start it or engage it or or or
[25:26] or forbidden it
[25:29] uh I don't know what will be the future
[25:32] holds but uh internet is a the internet
[25:36] um structure is uh
[25:38] decentralized so uh if uh you know if if
[25:42] in the US states U the the US government
[25:46] closes or or bans the money money
[25:49] transmitters like we saw it in the past
[25:52] few months they just go into another
[25:54] state another jurisdiction where it's uh
[25:57] acceptable and us uh residents can
[26:00] connect that that Bitcoin uh lightning
[26:04] or or Bitcoin aggregator so I think it's
[26:08] not a problem it's just it's not
[26:10] convenience to to use VPN or other
[26:12] stuffs but you can you can manage it
[26:15] it's also interesting to think about the
[26:17] whole uh Game Theory aspect of it
[26:19] because even if if some country bans it
[26:22] they might be another country that
[26:24] accept uh we have already El Salvador
[26:27] that is really really really friendly to
[26:29] bitcoin we have swiss that is quite
[26:32] friendly even with Lugano in the city we
[26:34] have other states we other small cities
[26:37] and places where there a lot of Bitcoin
[26:39] adoption and Bitcoin friendly
[26:40] environment so if if other states are
[26:43] like ah we we don't like Bitcoin we we
[26:46] want to ban it it will the capital will
[26:48] just float to other countries yes how is
[26:51] it in Hungary actually like I I know
[26:53] from Austria that it's not really a
[26:56] topic till now like there are some
[26:58] adoption going on uh not a lot of things
[27:01] are happening uh I mean the German
[27:03] speaking Community is quite strong
[27:04] actually but um how do do you see in
[27:07] Hungary the the adoption is is it
[27:10] good I think adoption will be starting
[27:13] from this year I talk to a lot of um
[27:17] business person High business person you
[27:19] know not local businesses but but U
[27:22] million euros business persons and uh
[27:25] they know Bitcoin they try to and
[27:28] Bitcoin I talk to them and uh they would
[27:31] like to transact this as well so one of
[27:33] my partners asked me uh Hey fair when we
[27:36] can uh get uh when when do you buy when
[27:40] do you want to buy uh steel rebars from
[27:43] me with Bitcoin and I you know in the
[27:46] late late of the later of the year maybe
[27:48] we can do it so um people are trying to
[27:51] catching up on the politics side you
[27:54] know on the nation state level um
[27:57] hungarians are really really busy with
[28:00] the politics the inner politics and the
[28:02] Euro Zone politics and they don't really
[28:05] bother about Bitcoin and uh uh and all
[28:08] politicians are just
[28:11] uh uh bragging each
[28:15] other sometimes I think they don't uh
[28:18] really care about uh getting getting the
[28:22] state getting Hungary uh more fruitful
[28:25] or more uh more better place uh just uh
[28:28] getting into position so Hungarian lows
[28:31] are really good we have a 15% personal
[28:36] tax uh uh about uh if if you if you sell
[28:39] your Bitcoin but just the only uh only
[28:44] only way they tax it so if you hold
[28:46] Bitcoin you you you won't be taxed and
[28:48] 50% is not a not a high value for um for
[28:54] gains only only for gains for um uh for
[28:59] companies and U business side they have
[29:03] similar the same uh account as as a
[29:06] stock uh as a stock uh if you hold a
[29:11] stock so it's not a problem I think so
[29:13] it's a natural the countries don't
[29:16] really bother about Bitcoin people may
[29:18] be trying to catch
[29:20] up yeah it's it's it's uh it's a bummer
[29:23] that in Austria in Hungary in the EU EU
[29:28] Bitcoin is not really a topic till now
[29:30] uh like in the elections even now in
[29:33] America already the topics uh is crypto
[29:37] like Trump is accepting Bitcoin payments
[29:39] and stuff like that like in in America
[29:41] it seems like they're a little further
[29:43] down the road also with Robert Kennedy
[29:45] Jr uh um having having a run in the
[29:49] elections and he's like in the Bitcoin
[29:51] conferences he's talking about Bitcoin
[29:53] really openly uh which is it's is just a
[29:57] positive sign that
[29:58] politicians are talking about Bitcoin
[30:01] like I really don't care about their
[30:02] politics but I like that it's a topic
[30:05] that that they have to come up with
[30:07] opinions and they have to come up with
[30:08] the debates on what they are saying and
[30:11] and they cannot no longer ignore it
[30:13] that's that's a really cool part in
[30:15] Austria I uh actually listened today and
[30:18] yesterday to some uh elections uh
[30:21] election debates of the lead candidates
[30:24] and there was one guy who said it's bad
[30:26] that the EU was like is so inflationary
[30:29] and they want to go back to like a hard
[30:31] asset but they were talking about the
[30:34] old austrialian currency not Bitcoin so
[30:36] I don't know what what to think about
[30:37] that that was the closest thing that
[30:39] someone mentioned hard money and and and
[30:42] the real problem but uh nobody really
[30:45] addresses addresses Bitcoin so it's it's
[30:47] interesting how how this will go also um
[30:51] as like I'm really young I'm 25 uh and
[30:55] when I got Bitcoin it was like four year
[30:58] yeah now four years ago so my knowledge
[31:01] about money and and economics was not
[31:05] like was building with Bitcoin already
[31:07] because with 2120 you don't know a lot
[31:10] about economics and and money um with
[31:13] you uh how how old were you when you
[31:15] when you got
[31:17] Bitcoin well
[31:19] 72 oh yeah and so so you so you already
[31:22] had like a um like few years like 10
[31:26] years 15 years in in business and and a
[31:28] career that you already like for um come
[31:31] up with a mind about money did you were
[31:34] before in this like fear mindset did
[31:36] Bitcoin like change you to AUST
[31:38] economics to to hard money or did you
[31:41] already had this this before no it's
[31:44] Chang changed me a lot you know I don't
[31:46] really know anything about investment or
[31:49] or or money you know I am engineer uh
[31:52] and I always love statistics numbers and
[31:55] other things and uh I don't really care
[31:57] about investment because uh my father
[32:00] started this company so he was in charge
[32:03] but uh after the year passed uh I I
[32:07] slowly come in charge and uh Bitcoin
[32:09] come away come come to my way and uh and
[32:13] I learn about uh you know stock to flow
[32:17] in housing markets because uh it uh this
[32:21] this Market has a special stock to flow
[32:24] uh uh philosophy and um
[32:28] and and uh I nobody learned about money
[32:32] I think before Bitcoin because money
[32:34] it's like paper money or or money in the
[32:36] back bank account but what really is
[32:38] money it's uh it's a revelation for me
[32:42] so it's it's it changed my mind how I
[32:44] see the the geopolitical plays and uh uh
[32:49] the people how people and the population
[32:52] organizes itself through money so it's
[32:54] it's just language and I didn't heard it
[32:58] before so uh it's really good uh to know
[33:03] these things and I always start with my
[33:05] uh lectures and speaks that uh what is
[33:08] money how uh Humanity uses
[33:12] money uh in the early uh early of the
[33:16] history and uh what money what forms of
[33:19] money did we use uh what is money
[33:23] now uh there is no goal behind any fiat
[33:27] currency
[33:28] when does it
[33:30] happened you know Breton woods and 1971
[33:34] Nixon thing and uh and people I I and I
[33:39] and I think and I see the people's faces
[33:41] and and I see that they didn't really
[33:45] heard about before that people in
[33:48] businesses people with uh uh with the
[33:52] with people who are using money as a as
[33:55] a tool to uh to make businesses so it's
[33:59] uh it's really
[34:02] interesting yeah it's it's it's it's
[34:04] also interesting to see when when people
[34:06] come into Bitcoin uh they got they get
[34:09] introduced to whole other topics also
[34:12] like privacy Freedom it's it's it's
[34:15] fascinating
[34:18] for physics
[34:20] yes how why why did you say physics
[34:24] because because Shoto solve it to to uh
[34:29] get the energy and atoms to attach to
[34:33] the digital world it's a really hard
[34:35] concept so uh and and I always talk and
[34:39] I always said uh the my lectures and
[34:42] talk to people like this because uh
[34:44] that's a really important thing that in
[34:46] math there is no time there is no past
[34:49] future and present just only math and
[34:51] it's uh and it's present every time the
[34:54] whole universe the whole Mass the zero
[34:58] the the the every value but in our time
[35:02] it's moving with energy and with atoms
[35:05] and satosi Link the together the the two
[35:09] so that's proof of work
[35:12] mechanism yeah it's it's it's
[35:14] fascinating also the the privacy and
[35:17] freedom aspect feel like influences a
[35:20] lot of uh bitcoiners or like people that
[35:22] come into Bitcoin how how do how did
[35:25] Bitcoin like change your uh view on on
[35:27] on other topics as
[35:30] well privacy is um I always laugh about
[35:33] them uh laugh about myself when when
[35:37] it's come about privacy because I'm a as
[35:39] a business person and and and I use my
[35:42] face and my connections to uh to change
[35:45] the world so and and I don't have so
[35:49] much privacy as uh other private person
[35:53] has can can be so uh a private person
[35:56] can be private
[35:58] uh I am as as a as I am a business
[36:02] people as a businessman I I uses my
[36:05] voice and my my face
[36:07] to uh to the world so uh I don't really
[36:12] bother about privacy you know I I bother
[36:14] but not so hard that I I don't use my
[36:17] face or my real name in the in the
[36:19] internet lot of people use this nick
[36:21] names I use my personal
[36:23] name well so privacy it's a it's a good
[36:27] thing but I uh it doesn't bother me as
[36:31] as much as other people and I and I get
[36:33] it it's okay just it's not a topic for
[36:36] me yeah do do you still think like I'm
[36:40] the same way
[36:41] because I have a daily podcast I talk
[36:44] every day about different stuff there's
[36:45] my clear name there there's my face
[36:48] there so I I pretty much have no privacy
[36:52] with with what I think about that
[36:53] because it's every day um but um do you
[36:56] feel like there is kind of a war against
[37:00] those against Freedom against privacy
[37:03] especially you all in the European Union
[37:06] where a lot of things are happening
[37:08] where they try to like look into
[37:10] messaging apps because they want to
[37:11] fight terrorists and stuff like that uh
[37:13] do you think there there's an active war
[37:16] on on privacy right now yeah sure I
[37:19] think we are we are at the war of
[37:21] privacy uh in the EU and in the US as
[37:24] well and I'm uh and then don't don't
[37:27] really like it so uh a lot of nonsense
[37:31] uh things and uh and legislation comes
[37:35] with the EU uh from from Brussel so uh I
[37:40] don't really understand why they are
[37:42] doing this maybe it's just not a
[37:44] coincidence they are not so foolish they
[37:47] are do it with intent so U unfortunately
[37:50] but Bitcoin can help us because it's a
[37:53] it's a peaceful Revolution if you buy
[37:55] Bitcoin you you pay you you have a vote
[37:58] with your money to Freed them and the
[38:02] the fascinating thing is it's the first
[38:04] Revolution where you gain uh Financial
[38:08] purchasing power with it usually in a
[38:10] revolution when you're actually
[38:11] participating in the revolution you have
[38:13] to pay for that you have to really
[38:15] suffer for that but in Bitcoin it's a
[38:18] peaceful and Revolution that actually uh
[38:22] gives you a lot of power uh in the long
[38:24] run if you're participating in Bitcoin
[38:27] uh in the revolution of Bitcoin since 10
[38:29] years and you actually hle Bitcoin for
[38:31] 10 years you are doing really great like
[38:35] you could could not even do bad
[38:37] financially it's a fascinating thing to
[38:39] think about I think we are making
[38:41] history I always talk my folks that uh
[38:43] if you buy Bitcoin you are making
[38:45] history 20 years from now when you talk
[38:48] to your daughter or or grandson they
[38:51] will point at you but granddaddy you
[38:53] bought Bitcoin in 2014 2024 or something
[38:57] so we are making history I think and and
[39:01] the good side because it's good for
[39:03] Humanity good for people good for nation
[39:05] state as well but um we will have a hard
[39:08] Road I think maybe maybe Nations will
[39:10] have a hard hard road to uh to ride but
[39:15] Bitcoin is truth and I think uh truth
[39:19] and truth is really important in life
[39:22] because you can you can lie about
[39:26] anything for yourself as well but uh the
[39:29] nature the reality is pretty important
[39:33] and Bitcoin shows the real world
[39:38] reality it it also humbles uh all all
[39:41] the persons the Bad actors uh and uh
[39:45] what you said with with making history
[39:47] is really interesting um when you like
[39:50] now look maybe at your grand grand kids
[39:53] uh and they have like some school lesson
[39:57] or some some lessons about the area
[39:59] where you are their grand grandads like
[40:02] you uh was in how do you think they will
[40:05] look back in in in at at Bitcoin like
[40:08] how do you think uh people in hundred
[40:11] 200 300 years will look back at that
[40:13] area with with
[40:15] Bitcoin I think they will look us like
[40:18] we look back when those people who uh
[40:22] were went to Europe to
[40:24] America to establish the United States
[40:27] States I think uh Bitcoin is I I can I I
[40:30] am familiar with and and I I like the
[40:33] idea that Bitcoin is a nation state in
[40:34] the in the metaverse or in the digital
[40:37] world so uh we are really uh everybody
[40:41] in an
[40:43] entrepreneur uh uh in Bitcoin world so
[40:47] we are making history right
[40:50] now do you also think that Bitcoin
[40:54] changes how nation states work because
[40:57] when we take with Bitcoin away the money
[41:00] printer uh and uh we have Bitcoin as
[41:04] like the store value it's like the unit
[41:05] of accounts Med exchanges everything um
[41:08] how will this distant impact Society if
[41:11] there is no Central force on money no no
[41:16] Monopoly on violence no Monopoly on the
[41:18] money
[41:19] printer yeah I think reality will come
[41:22] into their faces who are who are not uh
[41:25] productive enough who are waiting for
[41:28] government money who are who who has uh
[41:32] political power and have money like this
[41:35] so uh the reality will uh show their
[41:39] show its faces so Bitcoin will concur
[41:43] every other Fiat currencies maybe a lot
[41:44] of nation state will have Fiat
[41:47] currencies for 100 years but they will
[41:50] always be broke maybe it's just a
[41:52] monopoly money and uh uh the first
[41:55] mover's advantage will be really
[41:58] important as a nation state
[42:01] also really really cool Lov it um before
[42:04] we come to the endro te of our podcast
[42:06] uh I would love to uh get something uh
[42:11] before in um what are you currently
[42:13] passionate about which we did not cover
[42:15] in the podcast like what are you
[42:18] currently learning and and deeply
[42:20] researching because I feel like Bitcoin
[42:22] is extremely interesting people and they
[42:24] have a lot of interest a lot of
[42:26] knowledge on on topics that not directly
[42:29] are associated with Bitcoin is there
[42:31] anything that you're currently really
[42:32] passionate about really learning
[42:34] about yeah I have I have a I have my own
[42:38] calculations you know don't trust verify
[42:40] and I uh and everybody told you that
[42:44] Bitcoin is a really good investment you
[42:46] have 100% gains in every year but I I'm
[42:50] you know I'm a numbers guy I'm an
[42:52] engineer so I uh I get myself and uh and
[42:56] download it from who finance the weekly
[42:58] Bitcoin uh closes and I have a really I
[43:03] have a question for you uh what do you
[43:06] think if uh if we if you started to
[43:09] invest 10 EUR every week in the past 10
[43:12] years from
[43:13] 2014 you put away
[43:17] €2,200 approximately but what do you
[43:20] think was the buying power of that
[43:24] Bitcoin after 10 years so every every
[43:27] week you just buy € 10 of Bitcoin you
[43:31] have 5,000 investment what do you seeing
[43:35] the buying power today
[43:37] now without calculations just just the
[43:40] gut feeling what's Your Gut Feeling uh
[43:43] that has to be a big number yeah uh it's
[43:49] definitely I would say in the hundreds
[43:52] of
[43:53] millions no not really just just 10 EUR
[43:56] per week
[43:58] nothing just
[44:01] 10
[44:02] every maybe buy maybe a million to 10
[44:06] million no it's a 300
[44:11] 3,40 so it's more than €300,000 but
[44:14] imagine that when I talk to people
[44:16] ordinary people who don't have uh
[44:19] investments in the real world because
[44:22] because they don't have enough money to
[44:24] to buy a stock or or buy some gold
[44:26] because they have only € 10 per week and
[44:29] I and I tell them listen to me guys in
[44:32] the last 10 years it works this uh like
[44:34] this if you put away 10 EUR and buy
[44:37] Bitcoin you have more than €300,000
[44:40] EUR that's that's a whole game changer
[44:43] for for an average man they can they can
[44:45] buy a house or they can start a business
[44:48] or something you know so uh and a lot of
[44:51] people the average people will uh
[44:54] average people just sell just just buy
[44:57] 10 for cheap or or meanless things buy a
[45:01] lotto buy a buy a lottery ticket or
[45:03] something you know which um it's useless
[45:07] but uh it's really I'm really passionate
[45:10] about this and and and I use this and I
[45:13] started to make uh more interesting
[45:16] calculations that uh what if I uh I also
[45:20] examined quy segments I calculated
[45:22] returns if the investment started in uh
[45:25] in in 9 years or nine years and eight
[45:28] and a half years and something and I and
[45:30] I found that that the compounded average
[45:34] growth rate ranged from minimum
[45:37] 26% every year to an average to 49% and
[45:41] the highest was uh about more than 100%
[45:45] uh average compounded growth and uh it's
[45:49] I have made this in Excel sheets and I
[45:51] will make some videos about it because I
[45:53] think it's really really interesting and
[45:55] it's really uh
[45:57] R revealing that uh I think Bitcoin is
[46:02] really good for uh for for uh for an
[46:06] account for investments in the future so
[46:10] it's uh lot of people don't really a lot
[46:13] of people think Bitcoin if if you if you
[46:15] have Bitcoin you have to trade it you
[46:17] have to sell it sometime but I always
[46:19] said talk to people like just buy 10 or
[46:23] buy1 a month or something you will and
[46:26] then you will will find it 10 years from
[46:29] now 20x or or 30X
[46:33] more
[46:34] I I I I I completely underrated uh the
[46:39] the price in 2014 I just look at it it
[46:42] was also
[46:43] $800 $500 depending on what what time uh
[46:47] you pick in 2014 I thought it's way
[46:49] cheaper I thought like you know weekly
[46:52] weekly 10 euros uh would buy you almost
[46:55] four Bitcoins oh yeah 10 EUR weekly 10
[46:59] EUR and it it won't be uh it won't be
[47:01] the it won't be you won't you you you
[47:04] wouldn't buy uh you could you you
[47:07] couldn't buy 10 EUR you can't you can
[47:09] buy I'm sorry so uh 10 won't buy you
[47:14] four Bitcoins in the next 10 years but
[47:18] it's not not a problem it's about uh
[47:21] it's about how much you uh you're buying
[47:24] power out of the € 10 what you separated
[47:28] from this day and for the future 10
[47:32] years yeah a lot of people
[47:35] underestimate how much a Bitcoin is when
[47:39] you really think of like there's only 21
[47:41] million there will be a portion left
[47:43] that is always uh um in some wallets
[47:47] that don't want to spend or maybe want
[47:49] to die with their Bitcoin there will
[47:51] always be some lost there will always be
[47:54] the the stack of of satosi Nakamoto some
[47:57] maybe there's like 10 to 15 million
[48:00] Bitcoin that are actually
[48:02] movable those numbers can can vary and
[48:05] then you put that that on top of like a
[48:07] growing population of almost eight
[48:09] billion people already uh where there
[48:12] are a lot of uh people that have
[48:14] thousands of Bitcoins so uh when you
[48:17] look at it like one Bitcoin you will be
[48:21] in the top top top top 1% of the world
[48:24] when Bitcoin is actually fully adopted
[48:26] and
[48:27] the main store value and uni of account
[48:30] even like 0.1 Bitcoin will put you high
[48:35] up there uh depending on the time frame
[48:38] of course 0.1 Bitcoin will not help you
[48:40] next year uh but in 10 20 years it's a
[48:44] whole different uh whole different um
[48:47] yeah story you will count it you will
[48:49] count it in Sates my my kids are trying
[48:52] to calculate like this you know 10
[48:55] 10,000 Sates every week
[48:57] so we are we are calculating in satosi
[49:00] already now that's really really cool I
[49:02] think we even need something below Sates
[49:05] at some point satosi are too high I
[49:07] guess layer twos layer three will solve
[49:09] it m Sates or something like this so
[49:12] yeah 100% 100% yeah yeah really cool um
[49:16] thank you this then now we can come to
[49:18] the to the end routine um uh of our
[49:21] podcast which is the previous guest is
[49:24] asking a question for the next guest
[49:26] without knowing who the next guest
[49:27] actually is uh and your question from
[49:29] the previous guest is what part of your
[49:32] life has Bitcoin changed the most maybe
[49:35] proof of work is a is a really good idea
[49:39] because it it comes up every part of my
[49:43] life you know proof of work like waking
[49:45] up early doing exercises a proof of work
[49:49] in business to to build a company with
[49:54] with good people
[49:56] good uh
[49:59] relationships doing great things this is
[50:02] proof of work uh I think nature is uh
[50:06] working with proof of work and uh and I
[50:09] didn't really realize it before Bitcoin
[50:12] before understanding
[50:14] Bitcoin yeah that's uh proof of work is
[50:16] a big one like if you put in the proof
[50:19] of work every day you're putting
[50:21] something in there uh you will get
[50:23] something out if if this what you're
[50:25] doing is is uh makes sense I love the
[50:28] concept of proof of work you can really
[50:30] see like who who's in their life a proof
[50:33] of stake kind of guy and who's a work
[50:35] kind of guy you you really see that um
[50:38] thank you fair for for being on it was a
[50:39] pleasure talking with you um is the
[50:42] anything you want to add to the podcast
[50:45] uh and second question where can people
[50:47] find you the best way if they want to
[50:49] reach out to you and ask you questions
[50:52] yeah thank you much uh nothing to add uh
[50:55] and I'm sorry I'm not really full Curr l
[50:56] in English but I'm trying uh you can
[51:00] find me on X on Twitter on LinkedIn on

[51:10] U and if if if I can help anybody just
[51:14] send me a DM and and I really appreciate
[51:17] to talk to everybody about
[51:19] Bitcoin I love it and and your English
[51:22] is good uh mine mine is also a little
[51:25] bit clanky sometimes I miss words
[51:27] sometimes I don't have the real maybe
[51:30] something I can add uh I'm organizing a
[51:33] a Bitcoin conference Bitcoin only
[51:34] conference at uh this year at October uh
[51:38] 2018 to 20 and uh we will have mainly um
[51:44] Hungarian for Hungarian people the
[51:46] locals and um folks around the country
[51:49] but um it will be free every every talks
[51:53] and every venues what I I held about bit
[51:56] coin is free completely free uh and uh
[51:59] we are just trying to uh organize it uh
[52:03] and I hope uh some International
[52:05] bitcoiners maybe come uh to our venue I
[52:09] contacted M and uh he said if he has if
[52:13] he don't have uh other programs uh we
[52:17] are the plan B as he said so maybe he
[52:20] can come uh but other people will be uh
[52:23] contacted as well uh a lot of people and
[52:26] the Hungarian 21 group will be U make
[52:31] Keynotes on my conference Bitcoin on the
[52:34] conference
[52:35] so um we we will have more information
[52:39] in the next uh months or so is it then
[52:43] in the Hungarian language or is it
[52:45] English mainly Hungarian language
[52:48] because you know if you if you want to
[52:50] uh educate yourself uh from
[52:52] Internationals you can uh uh watch your
[52:55] podcasts and go to bitcoin prag I will
[52:58] be there and uh uh in Bitcoin prag also
[53:02] but uh hungarians is a language barrier
[53:04] so uh so uh the our community needs
[53:08] Hungarian voice and live voice so that's
[53:13] why I organize conference and talks and
[53:15] speeches uh in know local
[53:18] communities I love it and I just looked
[53:20] at my statistics uh there are
[53:23] 0.1% of my viewers are from Hungaria
[53:27] so so there there are some some people
[53:29] out there that are watching now from
[53:31] Hungaria so please go to the conference
[53:35] it will be I guess it will be really
[53:37] great uh um if I would know hungar I I I
[53:42] learned a little bit Hungarian uh
[53:44] because I had an Hungarian girlfriend
[53:47] like five years ago uh or like six years
[53:51] ago even uh but I have like I forgot
[53:54] everything unfortunately but there was
[53:57] time learn a little bit it's a hard
