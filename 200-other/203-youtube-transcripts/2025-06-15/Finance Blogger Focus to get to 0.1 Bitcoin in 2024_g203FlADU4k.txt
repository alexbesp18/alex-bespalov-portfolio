[00:00] 10 million satosi will be generational
[00:02] wealth 1 million Satoshi is a really
[00:04] good amount people living longer than
[00:06] their savings is a real problem like
[00:08] they outlive their own savings and then
[00:10] they cannot work anymore why is there
[00:11] inflation at all do you think the
[00:13] traditional Financial space Will Survive
[00:16] they will not survive in this
[00:19] [Music]
[00:21] form love your financial block and also
[00:25] you switch from tradition traditional
[00:27] Finance to really focusing more on
[00:29] bitcoin
[00:31] um I mean now you made a little bit of a
[00:32] break we talked about it before but
[00:34] maybe we can get into this a little bit
[00:36] later um what I'm really curious about
[00:38] your name of the show is really
[00:40] interesting one million Satoshi H
[00:43] because I'm always like 10 million
[00:45] satosi will be generational wealth at
[00:47] some point but you seem to like go one
[00:49] step lower than that one million Sates
[00:51] what what is the significance for you of
[00:53] that amount of one million Sates well in
[00:56] the beginning many um people asked me
[01:00] where can I start what can I do really
[01:02] in the beginning to invest in and buy uh
[01:05] of course uh Bitcoin and I was thinking
[01:09] about a name that can be really uh a
[01:13] good tip to really start and we thought
[01:16] or I thought that 1 million satosi is a
[01:19] really good amount to just try Bitcoin
[01:22] to know how it what it means to really
[01:25] have a wallet on your own even to send
[01:28] satosi and try and and practice how to
[01:31] do it and uh 1 million satosi is an
[01:33] amount that many that is a lot you have
[01:36] to really save it especially now that
[01:39] the that the Bitcoin is worth much more
[01:41] than when I started it really you really
[01:44] have to save your euros and your Fiat to
[01:47] get this one million Satoshi but on the
[01:49] other hand it's not so much that you're
[01:51] really afraid to spend it or even okay
[01:55] it's not a good thing and it's not a
[01:57] good feeling but even lose it so it's
[02:00] not not such a big thing and if you do
[02:03] the first step if you have the 1 million
[02:05] satosi then afterwards you will get gain
[02:08] more and more self-confidence and are
[02:11] ready to start and invest more in
[02:13] Bitcoin yeah I think 1 million is
[02:15] already a great amount and also it's
[02:17] it's it's just great to say like oh I'm
[02:19] as a Toshi millionaire like this this
[02:21] thing is I love it a lot and I always
[02:24] say to people who have no savings
[02:26] especially people like they 18 years old
[02:28] they just starting out like get to 10
[02:30] million Sates as quickly as possible
[02:33] like get to this goal like especially it
[02:36] depends on where you live the 10 million
[02:39] Sates could be Out Of Reach uh but if
[02:42] you have the means to kind of you can
[02:44] think of like getting to 10 million
[02:46] soses which is now like 6,000 $6,000
[02:49] around that uh that's a really great
[02:51] goal but as you said like to start with
[02:53] like 600 euros $600 in in Bitcoin with
[02:56] one Millions sores it's a great start
[02:58] and really cool um but let's get into
[03:01] like why you kind of focused on bitcoin
[03:04] why you shifted originally from uh more
[03:07] financial blocking do more Bitcoin
[03:10] blogging in the start in the beginning
[03:12] when I started Financial blogging it was
[03:15] around
[03:16] 2020 so right before actually right
[03:20] before the corona crisis uh but
[03:23] then mid in the midst of the corona
[03:26] crisis I started blocking about finance
[03:28] and I was not really aware of Bitcoin uh
[03:31] to start with I thought it is just a
[03:34] tool to get more money and someone
[03:37] invented it just to gain to be rich and
[03:41] uh my thing was to do really sensible
[03:45] family finances to really know what uh
[03:49] ETFs are to really know what to do if
[03:52] you um want to save something when
[03:55] you're older and even provide something
[03:58] for your family and also for your kids
[04:00] and that's why I started a Blog and also
[04:03] a podcast with a podcast colleague and
[04:06] also a blogger colleague and together we
[04:09] had for roughly one one and a half year
[04:13] a podcast around that topic later on uh
[04:17] he stopped his blog and podcasting and
[04:21] in this phase it was around 2021 or so I
[04:25] discovered Bitcoin because we had a
[04:27] guest we invited a guest who was um
[04:30] someone well known in the Bitcoin or
[04:33] something well Avers in the Bitcoin
[04:35] space and he talked about Bitcoin and I
[04:39] was not uh really sure what this is and
[04:41] then I started to write an article about
[04:44] Bitcoin and this was uh highly
[04:46] interested for many of our our readers
[04:50] and this was the first step that I
[04:52] really thought okay there is something
[04:54] more than just an investment thing it
[04:57] must be uh something more that someone
[05:00] just wants to get rich and after some
[05:03] research and a long research and
[05:06] thousands of hours okay not thousands
[05:08] but hundreds I guess oh I think by now
[05:10] there are thousands of hours of research
[05:13] I know I have a glimpse on what Bitcoin
[05:16] is and I maybe know a little bit about
[05:18] Bitcoin I thought okay this is a thing
[05:21] and uh then I shifted my topic
[05:24] completely towards uh Bitcoin and only
[05:27] wrote about Bitcoin and invited guests
[05:30] and talked about Bitcoin
[05:32] only really cool is there some because I
[05:35] think like from podcasting from speaking
[05:38] about something and from inviting guests
[05:40] also like you learn a lot yourself at
[05:43] least it was my experience the half last
[05:45] half year uh what did you learn from
[05:47] blogging about finance and money before
[05:49] even uh getting to
[05:51] bitcoin about Finance in general you
[05:54] mean some some learnings about money and
[05:57] and finances yeah well right in the
[05:59] beginning I was investing in
[06:03] it um around 2010 so quite a long time
[06:08] for 14 15 years by now and I had some
[06:12] learnings because of that and then I was
[06:16] right in the middle of the decision we
[06:18] had two children two babies and thought
[06:21] okay is it now good to have all our
[06:24] savings that was invested um at the
[06:27] stock market to put everything into a
[06:30] big house and um in this point of time I
[06:35] thought okay what would would make more
[06:37] sense and that's why I blocked a lot
[06:40] about it what it makes more sense having
[06:42] St your stock or having um a house and
[06:46] this helped me a lot as you said if you
[06:48] not only read about something but also
[06:50] write about something and even try to
[06:52] teach someone about it really learn a
[06:55] topic by heart and after several months
[06:59] I was sure okay buying a house in this
[07:01] point of time is not the the right
[07:03] decision for us and looking back
[07:06] absolutely it was the right decision to
[07:08] not buy a house around the covid crisis
[07:10] because the uh price did go down
[07:13] afterwards maybe some say it's a bubble
[07:16] uh there was a housing bubble maybe it
[07:18] was maybe not but at least you see that
[07:21] it was a good decision to not just
[07:23] bluntly buy a house without even knowing
[07:25] your finances this is very important
[07:27] before that especially the area I don't
[07:30] know how it's around the world I I talk
[07:33] with a lot of Canadians Americans and
[07:35] they also kind of kind of agree on that
[07:37] but I know in Austria and I think
[07:39] probably also in Germany having a house
[07:43] is kind of like your personal savings
[07:45] account like most people view it as like
[07:47] that oh yeah I I get a loan I work to
[07:49] toward wordss that loan 10 years to 30
[07:51] years and then it's paid off and that's
[07:53] kind of my pension that's kind of my my
[07:55] savings account which I think is very
[07:57] wrong but a lot of people I view it as
[08:00] that um it's it's really interesting to
[08:02] get down this Rabbit Hole why did you
[08:04] decide to not get in this real estate I
[08:06] feel like a lot of people actually go
[08:09] exactly down this route like they like
[08:10] oh everyone needs houses there will
[08:13] always be a demand for houses all those
[08:15] those easy to understand Arguments for
[08:17] Real Estate which are I think not true
[08:20] but uh how did you decide I think it was
[08:24] really hard because it is was always
[08:27] such a lifelong dream like you know if
[08:29] you're a small girl you don't know that
[08:31] already but it was also always a dream
[08:34] you know to get married to have kids to
[08:36] have a own house to have a garden and
[08:38] this is something that um was in my life
[08:41] as well I thought okay if you really
[08:43] save everything and if you work hard uh
[08:46] later on you and you you can buy
[08:49] absolutely something like that you can
[08:51] have a um a real estate somewhere and
[08:54] then you can live there with your family
[08:56] and it's not only an investment decision
[08:59] this uh think it's a really really
[09:01] emotional decision it's like a symbol of
[09:04] something that you build and that you
[09:06] are proud of and it was really hard in
[09:09] this time it took me really several
[09:10] month or even years to understand that
[09:13] uh this dream has been hijacked somehow
[09:17] by by people that get you um that make a
[09:20] profit of it so maybe the the banks or
[09:24] even State because you see that people
[09:28] tend to vote more conservative if they
[09:30] buy a house and that's uh why there is
[09:33] an interest of many people uh and many
[09:36] people that make profit and make money
[09:38] feat money from you that you have such a
[09:41] real estate and I think it was a kind of
[09:44] Awakening experience that I thought okay
[09:46] this is was my childhood dream but some
[09:49] somehow uh is just telling me that it
[09:51] should be my dream but on the other hand
[09:54] he has a really backside and this
[09:55] backside is that you have a high um that
[09:59] you have to high credit that you have to
[10:01] work all the time that you maybe don't
[10:03] see your children that often because you
[10:05] have to be at work that you have to work
[10:08] until you uh get your pension and that
[10:11] somehow you I I had only in German this
[10:15] word hamster it like a hamster wheel
[10:19] that you keep
[10:21] having I I I actually have no clue
[10:24] what's that in English that's so funny
[10:26] because I talk all the time like it's
[10:28] this N9 to five I think in English a lot
[10:31] of people just call it
[10:34] Matrix yeah I I don't know if this this
[10:37] word actually is is something in English
[10:39] I never heard it but yeah I think this
[10:41] this uh uh this this wheel card uh if
[10:44] like just being in there and and not
[10:47] only like getting in there like it's
[10:48] it's I think a lot of people just make
[10:50] the comparison with The Matrix I don't
[10:52] know if this really is a good comparison
[10:54] but I think a lot of people just call it
[10:56] oh you like going into Matrix feed
[10:58] Mining and uh I have to research if
[11:01] there's a good word for it yeah me too
[11:03] maybe someone wants to comment and have
[11:06] on the on the right word on the the
[11:07] video um yeah but I thought okay this is
[11:10] not the life I want to be because a big
[11:14] uh value of mine is being independent
[11:16] and this way I knew that I cannot be
[11:19] independent and I think I developed this
[11:21] value in my life because I read quite
[11:25] early a rant ATR and somehow this book
[11:30] did something to me and I knew that
[11:32] being independent and having a life I
[11:34] want to have and not something others
[11:38] want me to do is really really important
[11:41] in your life and money and having your
[11:46] finances right and being independent not
[11:48] to spend a lot just to be independent is
[11:52] crucial to that and I knew that if we
[11:55] buy this real estate we would not feel
[11:58] free anymore
[11:59] yeah it kind of It kind of your own
[12:03] house enslaves you to to work for it uh
[12:06] your whole your life because like most
[12:08] loans are 30 years as I see it some go
[12:11] with 10 years uh but 30 years like you
[12:13] start doing that with 30 you do it till
[12:16] 60 you basically all your working life
[12:18] you are tied to that house and and then
[12:22] there we come to this discussion where
[12:23] most people with uh 60 there are a lot
[12:26] of studies on that like most people uh
[12:29] once they get into um pension and they
[12:33] go to the retirement age uh really soon
[12:37] all those um illness started and all
[12:40] those things start with with the
[12:41] problems and then you're like oh you
[12:42] finally are in retirement where you
[12:44] always wanted to be and then oh your
[12:47] body does not do it because you hammered
[12:50] down your body for like 30 years to get
[12:52] this loan right and then you cannot even
[12:54] enjoy it so like a lot of things are are
[12:57] wrong and I think even like the the
[12:58] problem of people living longer than
[13:01] their savings is a real problem like
[13:03] they they outlive their own savings and
[13:06] then they cannot work anymore then the
[13:08] the kids of them have to step in and
[13:10] stuff like that like there are a lot of
[13:11] problems in that in that fat World which
[13:14] I see and I had yesterday actually a g
[13:17] guest on who has a funeral business uh
[13:20] and he has around 5,000 families uh per
[13:25] year uh in his funeral business that he
[13:27] deals with and he are really got some
[13:29] interesting perspectives on on that
[13:31] because he deals a he deals a lot with
[13:34] grieving families with with what what
[13:36] people regret in life and that that's
[13:39] see he sees a lot of that like people
[13:41] want to spend time more with the
[13:42] families more time with what they
[13:44] actually like to do and I think the feat
[13:47] system really has something to do with
[13:50] that because people cannot really save
[13:52] in anything they they try to save in the
[13:54] Euro and they get screwed over over the
[13:57] long run with that and even if they save
[13:59] in their house it kind of keeps up with
[14:02] inflation but you have to work for that
[14:04] loan so it's a it's a it's a bad thing
[14:06] to to begin with um which also brings me
[14:09] to my actual first question that I had
[14:11] for you um what what do you think is the
[14:14] best thing that Bitcoin does for for
[14:16] Humanity uh when when we look at that
[14:18] when we look at all the things that we
[14:20] already discussed what what is for you
[14:22] the the thing that Bitcoin kind of
[14:24] brings in a more holistic uh view well
[14:27] when I discovered Bitcoin it was was not
[14:29] so much about much how the how it's
[14:32] worth in Fiat and how it develops over
[14:34] time it's more another way to see the
[14:37] world and it was the first time I really
[14:40] uh discovered this
[14:41] other angle on the world well it's hard
[14:44] to say because um I really had some
[14:49] libertarian views before Bitcoin but
[14:52] there were more diffused not something
[14:55] sometimes I had an opinion on this and
[14:58] then on this and
[15:00] um it was not really how could I say
[15:02] Bitcoin made the picture for me so that
[15:04] I really see the the connections behind
[15:07] that and see how in general this is uh
[15:11] working some all of the sudden the world
[15:14] make made more sense to me so that it it
[15:17] should be every decision should be
[15:19] decentralized that there should be in
[15:22] politics and so on not someone who is
[15:25] guiding the way but more letting the
[15:28] people do what they decide and I think
[15:31] this point of view I I somehow had but
[15:33] it was I did not Discover it really
[15:37] Bitcoin helped me to discover that uh
[15:40] and this was a a great moment and of
[15:42] course all the the Bitcoin Community the
[15:44] people that stood behind Bitcoin and
[15:48] immediately uh liked Bitcoin and somehow
[15:52] this the these people some are very
[15:55] different but some are all the same and
[15:58] I really like to be there in the
[16:01] community yeah it's a it's it's a
[16:03] massive Community I feel like Bitcoin
[16:05] kind of enables you to critical think
[16:07] about what you're doing with your with
[16:10] your time and you it values your time
[16:13] differently um which brings me to the
[16:16] topic uh we we kind of triggered before
[16:19] um why did you pause your your podcast
[16:22] now and what what was the the reasoning
[16:24] for that well I did my podcast next to
[16:27] my job and
[16:29] uh my aim was always to uh live to uh to
[16:34] live a a life uh with the things I love
[16:38] independently so that I do not have to
[16:40] uh work for a company um no matter which
[16:43] company but really self be self-employed
[16:46] and by the beginning of this year I
[16:48] managed to do so um I bought with two
[16:52] other uh friends of mine uh company and
[16:55] now we are working on our own company on
[16:58] our own
[16:59] aims and our own targets we have and I
[17:02] really enjoy it a lot so this is one
[17:04] part on the same time it is really good
[17:07] news for me so that I really uh reached
[17:10] that goal but on the other hand I do not
[17:12] have a goal in this regard anymore so
[17:14] that I can really live with the things
[17:17] uh I love which which was on the other
[17:20] hand also not so good message because I
[17:22] really had to find something new a new
[17:25] Target for me and I'm not now right in
[17:28] this transition mode is it that I want
[17:30] to do it again and keep on continue
[17:32] doing with my podcast with and 1 million
[17:35] satosi any million satosi or do I want
[17:37] to do something else next to my job and
[17:41] have a different goal because now I
[17:43] already have the big thing in my life so
[17:45] that I can work and earn something
[17:48] without um yeah without be working for
[17:52] another company if you watch or listen
[17:54] to my podcast on a regular basis I'll
[17:56] guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[17:59] and now the most important step is to
[18:01] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[18:04] hardware wallet my personal
[18:06] recommendation for harder wallet is the
[18:08] bit box it's super secure it's simple to

[19:23] also you made this year the the jump
[19:26] from being employed to being
[19:27] self-employed uh with with someone else
[19:30] uh do can can you share what what are
[19:32] you doing um yeah we having a small we
[19:37] are small publisher we are publishing
[19:39] books uh around e simple living
[19:43] minimalism how to um yeah do everything
[19:47] on your own at home with uh different
[19:50] plants and uh yeah and also some basic
[19:53] ingredients to your
[19:56] cleaning substances like nature soda uh
[20:01] and soap and something and if you have
[20:03] the right recipe and put everything
[20:05] together you get uh yeah you can clean
[20:07] everything in your house and this is
[20:09] this are the books about oh really cool
[20:12] yeah we are all bitcoiners we are
[20:14] thinking of also publishing a book about
[20:16] Bitcoin not that they are not so they
[20:18] are really good already on the market
[20:20] but maybe we do not publish a book about
[20:23] Bitcoin itself but somehow we can maybe
[20:26] mention it so that it can be a part of
[20:30] uh of minimalism and uh yeah simple
[20:33] living I think there can never be too
[20:36] much education like there's this saying
[20:39] like oh there are already so many
[20:40] Bitcoin books there are already so many
[20:42] Bitcoin things no they are not
[20:45] like if if there were already too many
[20:48] then nobody would buy a Bitcoin book
[20:50] like then then all of the new Bitcoin
[20:52] books that come out would not find
[20:53] anyone to to to buy it from so uh I I I
[20:57] think if if if there's too many you will
[21:00] see it in the sales numbers like if
[21:02] nobody buys it I also got that like oh
[21:05] there are already so many Bitcoin
[21:06] podcast oh I guess I guess people still
[21:09] watch my podcast uh and I can even now
[21:12] live on on on that podcast so I I think
[21:15] there's there's always demand for
[21:17] Education there's always demand for a
[21:20] new angle A New Perspective on things
[21:23] the same with with books I I I would
[21:26] love to see a published book
[21:29] oh good to hear thank you that's that
[21:31] sounds
[21:33] exciting is is is that published but
[21:36] you're the publisher so you don't write
[21:38] the Books you you only have writers that
[21:40] then write the Books and then you're
[21:42] publishing them for them uh no I also
[21:44] write the uh also write the Books what
[21:47] we are doing is just we publish them
[21:50] online and then afterwards if it's um
[21:53] there's enough interest about it we
[21:55] publish the the recipes or the the
[21:57] content
[21:59] but we um yeah it's most of the time we
[22:03] are writing the books by ourselves oh
[22:06] really cool really cool um really cool
[22:09] one absolutely question that has nothing
[22:12] to do with with Bitcoin do you have
[22:14] advice for someone who wants to write a
[22:17] book I'm kind of thinking of of doing
[22:19] something like that I'm I'm having some
[22:20] I wrote some articles uh and the
[22:23] articles are just there for me to clear
[22:26] my mind and and think of like oh what
[22:28] what's my FS around Bitcoin what's my f
[22:30] around this and that uh and my thinking
[22:33] is like uh I just want to clear my head
[22:35] with that but I'm like oh this those
[22:38] articles are getting very long I didn't
[22:40] even publish it it's just the Google
[22:42] Docs that I have to actually just for me
[22:44] uh but they getting so long that I'm
[22:47] like oh maybe I can even make a book out
[22:49] of that like do you have some something
[22:51] to uh as an advice well I would start
[22:56] small like having ebooks and uh selling
[22:59] it for I don't know three four and see
[23:02] if the the the topic catches I would
[23:05] also start a blog it also makes a lot of
[23:07] sense to um yeah collect everything you
[23:10] have and then you see what people
[23:12] interest and what are not so interesting
[23:13] for PE is not so interesting for people
[23:16] and then if you have not enough content
[23:18] and I know it's really hard it's really
[23:20] hard you have to do it for several I I
[23:23] think a several years and write a lot I
[23:27] would even recommend to write every day
[23:29] then you have a lot enough content and
[23:33] the next step would be if your ebooks
[23:35] are selling quite well to have even more
[23:37] self-publisher or go to um a publisher
[23:40] but it's really hard you know many many
[23:42] people write to us that they want they
[23:44] have a good content and so and U yeah
[23:46] most of the time we cannot do it because
[23:48] we have to test it we have to do it on
[23:50] your on our own because it's a big risk
[23:52] to print a book it costs a lot uh and
[23:56] yeah I would recommend and even we doing
[23:59] that we're doing not writing a book and
[24:01] then we're selling it we're just testing
[24:03] it all the time online and having ebooks
[24:05] and so on and then we're testing and if
[24:08] it's okay and if the people like it then
[24:10] we at some point point in time we are
[24:13] writing it mean do what's your opinion
[24:16] on like uh I did not research a lot in
[24:19] this regard but I I heard that you can
[24:21] just uh put your book on Amazon and if
[24:24] someone bu it they print it then for you
[24:27] uh you can have it ebook and and kind of
[24:29] test the the the markets and uh also
[24:32] with like even audiobooks like I'm a big
[24:34] audiobook uh fan um I'm like mostly an
[24:37] audible and and hear it you can I can do
[24:39] it basically myself just talking in the
[24:42] microphone and doing my audiobook uh
[24:44] other question is if someone is willing
[24:46] to listen to it but um it's like going
[24:50] to like an Amazon or going to some
[24:52] self-publishing thing the a good first
[24:56] step yeah it it is a good first step and
[24:58] I think you're doing also already the
[25:00] first step like building up a community
[25:02] it's not so it's it's easy to write a
[25:05] book everyone writes a book what it's
[25:07] not what's not easy is to have the
[25:08] community that buys the book and you
[25:10] have to build the community and I think
[25:12] this is something you are doing right
[25:14] now with your podcast I would even
[25:16] recommend also a Blog something that
[25:19] it's written that's written or even have
[25:22] a newsletter um community and you write
[25:25] something to them once a week and then
[25:28] if you you have enough content you can
[25:29] compile it like having self-publishing
[25:32] at Amazon is a good idea also um having
[25:35] ebooks at Amazon and I think I don't
[25:37] know if it's possible in Germany I don't
[25:39] think so but Amazon also has the audio
[25:42] version of your book so that's someone
[25:44] professional reads your book and you can
[25:46] sell also this if you do not want to
[25:49] read it on your own it's just just an
[25:52] another option and um yeah I think that
[25:56] the hard thing is building up the
[25:57] community
[25:59] yeah it's it's also like uh there's this
[26:01] popular saying I forgot who said it like
[26:04] first time Founders woring about the
[26:07] products and services they're building
[26:09] second time Founders are worrying about
[26:11] the
[26:13] distribution yeah first you're like oh
[26:15] product has to be no you have to find
[26:17] people that actually are willing to buy
[26:18] it like why build something if nobody uh
[26:20] is buying it I mean if you only build it
[26:22] for yourself for example like my my
[26:24] articles I don't even publish them I
[26:26] just want to clear my heads because
[26:28] what I saw is like I'm getting invited
[26:31] to other podcasts and they ask me oh you
[26:34] have you interviewed now almost 200
[26:36] bitcoiners like what are your main
[26:38] learnings and I'm like oh there are
[26:39] like 500 answers in my head and I cannot
[26:41] decide on one uh and so this was kind of
[26:44] my reasoning why I want to have an
[26:46] articles because I think writing is a
[26:49] great um clearing your mind on on
[26:52] something and that's really cool one
[26:54] thing that I'm curious about uh with you
[26:57] is I did when you were from the
[26:59] traditional Finance you learned a lot
[27:01] from that then you switched to bitcoin
[27:04] did your few on money in General on your
[27:07] F finances change with Bitcoin is is
[27:10] there something that U changed when you
[27:13] adopted Bitcoin or is was the mindset
[27:16] already there uh when you adopted it um
[27:19] well I had a quite in backside a quite
[27:23] good um
[27:24] [Music]
[27:26] understanding yeah good understanding on
[27:28] money because uh in 2010 I started to
[27:31] investing because of inflation of 2% and
[27:33] many people say Okay 2% is not it's not
[27:36] not a lot but on the other hand I just
[27:40] just calculated that 2% means that my
[27:43] money is only worth half of it in 35
[27:46] years and it makes absolutely no sense
[27:49] to save money on my bank account and but
[27:53] what is what's the difference before and
[27:55] after Bitcoin is before Bitcoin I just
[27:58] was looking for ways to invest my money
[28:01] differently it was also what can I only
[28:04] only what can I do to avoid inflation
[28:07] and after Bitcoin somehow discovered the
[28:10] why more so why is there inflation at
[28:13] all I've never asked that question
[28:15] before I just looked for solution to
[28:17] avoid inflation but not never asked a
[28:20] question why is inflation there and
[28:22] Bitcoin helped me a lot to understand
[28:24] the why even better and there is even a
[28:26] tool if if you want to find your vision
[28:29] on for your company or for your life and
[28:31] so on to ask four or five times why so
[28:36] why are you doing this so and why is
[28:38] this important to you and this way you
[28:41] discover your your goals way better and
[28:44] understand your life way better and S
[28:46] find a sense in your life way better and
[28:49] Bitcoin help me a lot asking the why
[28:51] questions if if you keep asking why
[28:54] that's uh can be a painful experience
[28:56] and can be something
[28:59]  like why do I do that actually uh
[29:02] also it's it's interesting that you got
[29:05] that inflation is bad like especially
[29:07] with like only one or 2% if your
[29:09] assumption is oh it's it's just 2%
[29:11] inflation most people don't get that
[29:13] like most people I think inflation is
[29:15] always a little bit higher than 2% when
[29:17] we look at asset prices inflation stuff
[29:19] like that but even 2% most people are
[29:21] like ah it's not that bad they they're
[29:24] like ah okay it's just 2% but then you
[29:26] get to the point where like oh
[29:29] like every year someone comes into the
[29:31] house and takes one small
[29:33] item after a few years you're like oh
[29:35]  where all the things are gone like
[29:38] that's why did
[29:39] you I feel like most people don't get
[29:42] that and I'm always curious like why
[29:43] people uh get that even like now when I
[29:47] speak with someone and inflation is so
[29:49] high with like 10% maybe 15% depending
[29:52] on what metrix you're looking at they're
[29:54] like no no it's not that bad like Oh My
[29:57] My Supermarket bill is is not that much
[29:58] higher they they don't seem to to see
[30:01] the problem even and you have to see the
[30:03] problem before you can see the solution
[30:06] why do you think people don't get that I
[30:07] don't really know it's maybe it's
[30:09] something I've always liked mathematics
[30:12] I I always like like numbers so somehow
[30:17] had have a good feeling for numbers um
[30:20] and I know that it there's not only the
[30:23] interest but also
[30:25] the how is it called if the compounding
[30:29] effect of compounding effect exactly and
[30:31] that humans do not understand it and I
[30:34] do not understand it as well but I
[30:35] thought it is a big thing to have the
[30:37] compounding effect to know the
[30:39] compounding effect and then I think I'm
[30:42] someone who is when when I see a problem
[30:45] I I really want to do it I'm a very um
[30:48] Hands-On person and I see that sometimes
[30:52] with my friends they really see the
[30:53] problem as well but they do not really
[30:55] do something but because the the life is
[30:57] full of stress especially of course if
[30:59] you have children and so on so you have
[31:01] so many things to do and you do not
[31:04] think that you it's it seems to to
[31:07] Really open u a wallet and to really buy
[31:11] Bitcoin and to uh learn the technical
[31:14] knowhow seems to be a big big burden so
[31:17] uh what I wanted to do with my podcast
[31:20] is also to make this burden easier to
[31:23] say it okay it's not not that hard and
[31:25] it can be also fun and a lot of um
[31:28] people who did hear the podcast said to
[31:31] me that they never have been interested
[31:33] in finance but once they hear hear an
[31:35] episode now they're really interested
[31:37] because it's something different it's
[31:38] not only finance it's also a
[31:41] spiritual I wouldn't say Awakening but
[31:44] Bitcoin is something else that you see
[31:46] the the world different than before it's
[31:48] more than just finance and money and um
[31:50] I think many people maybe understand
[31:53] money way better if they somehow invest
[31:56] more time in bit Bitcoin and even see
[31:59] Bitcoin from a different point of view
[32:01] so that they can optimize their life
[32:03] even with this
[32:07] cryptocurrency it it kind of all comes
[32:09] down to to ownership then right it's
[32:11] it's like you have to take ownership of
[32:13] of your life you have to take ownership
[32:15] of of of your Bitcoin why do you think
[32:17] uh is is that important like taking
[32:19] ownership taking self- custody taking
[32:22] owning your own decisions also owning
[32:24] your own life owning your time yeah
[32:26] because Bitcoin will never it will never
[32:28] be yours if you do not do it on your own
[32:31] so I heard so from so many especially
[32:33] from so many women ah my my husband has
[32:35] Bitcoin we have Bitcoin but it's not
[32:38] that you you have Bitcoin together it's
[32:40] belongs to one and it's okay that uh
[32:43] your husband always helps you and uh
[32:46] explains you what Bitcoin is but you
[32:48] never can have one Bitcoin together it's
[32:51] either his or your years and somehow you
[32:54] have to also learn it if he passes away
[32:57] way you know that you know how to do
[33:00] work with it that you know how to send
[33:02] it and to know how to uh give it to your
[33:05] children and I think this is a very
[33:07] important skill and you cannot say that
[33:09] yeah we have Bitcoin because my husband
[33:11] has Bitcoin it's um yeah big difference
[33:15] and that's why of course within a family
[33:17] you do not calculate everything uh you
[33:19] have we in our family we also have a
[33:22] joint bank account and we pay everything
[33:25] together and I do not say it's his money
[33:27] or money but in the end Bitcoin is some
[33:31] a different tool so to say you really
[33:33] have to know what you're doing you
[33:35] really have to be confident in working
[33:37] with Bitcoin it's not that big issue but
[33:40] you have to really learn it and practice
[33:41] it and that's why it's quite different
[33:44] to normal bank account yeah and it's
[33:47] like as you said like with with a normal
[33:50] bank account there's a judge who rules
[33:52] it like if if if then the judge says oh
[33:55] no like this money belongs to her or
[33:56] like oh he passed away then of course it
[33:59] gets to her with Bitcoin it's different
[34:01] if if he only knows how to access the
[34:04] Bitcoin and he passes
[34:06] away the Bitcoin are
[34:09] gone no charge can rule on that is that
[34:12] I saw also um a presentation you did at
[34:15] Les F orang that was uh also really cool
[34:19] how how do you see in general like this
[34:21] this whole like I know I have my uh my
[34:26] statistics uh on the podcast and I
[34:28] improved a lot on those statistics until
[34:31] now I had in the beginning like 4% of
[34:34] female viewers now I'm like coming
[34:37] slowly to 10% like I'm like seven eight%
[34:40] uh and even like really big ones like
[34:42] Natalie prell she posted a statistic she
[34:45] had like 20% female audience which is
[34:48] like she's a female um host she has a
[34:52] lot of female guests on uh and still she
[34:55] with such a female Focus only has like
[34:58] 20% so like seems like it's a very male
[35:03] focused uh group it's like tech tech
[35:06] coming towards money and both are like
[35:08] kind of dominant on that one how do you
[35:10] see like do do you think that that will
[35:12] be more or different question is it
[35:15] harder to Orange Peel uh woman I'd say
[35:19] yes as you said the interest in in Tech
[35:22] and finance you have to be interested in
[35:24] these two topics at least to have enough
[35:26] self-confidence to say okay I do not
[35:29] understand everything but I go to the
[35:31] meetups to the Bitcoin meetups
[35:33] nevertheless and learn and uh many women
[35:36] have if you I I just have to uh if I see
[35:40] my the the ads I see on YouTube when I
[35:42] go into YouTube and all the shorts I see
[35:45] are mostly advertisements targeted to
[35:47] men because I see so many Bitcoin videos
[35:50] and Tech videos and finance videos
[35:52] YouTube obviously thinks I'm male and
[35:54] that's why I always get get
[35:58] advertisement that obviously targeted
[35:59] for men with young young ladies and so
[36:02] on and being rich and having a good car
[36:04] and so on and that doesn't interest me
[36:06] at all but I'm interested in Tech and
[36:08] finance and somehow even the algorithm
[36:09] of YouTube doesn't understand that that
[36:11] you are female and interested in Tech
[36:14] it's yeah confusing for them so yeah it
[36:18] is how it is it's harder for but
[36:21] nevertheless I think we are different I
[36:23] think every gender has its own uh
[36:26] advantages
[36:28] and yeah I also see it in my my children
[36:30] I have a a girl and a and a
[36:33] boy and my boy is very interested in in
[36:37] Bitcoin he very interested in Tech and
[36:40] 3D printing and uh my my girl she's
[36:43] okaye is five is but even when my boy
[36:46] was five he was interested in Bitcoin
[36:48] and my uh my daughter is interested in
[36:52] yeah you know interested in caring for
[36:56] for the cat and caring for the garden
[36:59] and something like that it is how it is
[37:01] but nevertheless when I was a girl I was
[37:04] also interested in something like that
[37:06] you know Al having cats and so on and
[37:08] still I was I'm interested later also in
[37:11] Bitcoin so it's not nothing that women
[37:15] cannot understand or slower in
[37:18] understanding Bitcoin or something like
[37:20] that but they are definitely harder to
[37:23] orange bill because the interests are
[37:26] just different
[37:28] I think the the best quote I all heard
[37:31] on that is like women are more
[37:32] interested in in people and men are more
[37:35] interested in in things like I know uh
[37:39] when I hear my girlfriend talking with
[37:41] her best friend it's very different than
[37:43] when I talk to my best
[37:45] friend like very different topics I I
[37:49] talk about uh my business I talk about
[37:51] money I talk about Bitcoin I talk about
[37:53] all those things and then maybe rarely
[37:55] like five 4% of the is like oh how am I
[37:59] doing as a person how or like that like
[38:02] and and and when I hear my girlfriend
[38:04] it's like 95% that and then 5% something
[38:07] else like it it's but I'm very proud of
[38:09] her she she's now kind of orangee peing
[38:12] the the company where she is working
[38:14] because they asked her they asked they
[38:17] asked her what she she's uh what his
[38:20] boyfriend is doing like me uh and he's
[38:23] like oh he's in Bitcoin and then and now
[38:25] everyone comes with Bitcoin questions to
[38:26] her and she
[38:28] she's not Bitcoin in the
[38:30] company oh that's cool that's really
[38:32] good it's good to hear yeah it's it's
[38:34] just an everage uh of of the of the
[38:37] gender and there are always exceptions
[38:39] and so on but absolutely yeah I think
[38:42] that's always important to note that
[38:44] that's like uh not everyone is like that
[38:47] but that's like an an generalization and
[38:51] an average thing of that um just so uh I
[38:54] think we had it like few times already
[38:57] in the pod but I like to highlight it
[38:58] always um what is LAM orang because I
[39:01] think that they're doing a really cool
[39:03] job and they're doing a really cool
[39:04] thing maybe you can do something like
[39:07] what is that and and why are they doing
[39:09] what they do yeah I think Le were
[39:12] founded uh one and a half years or so
[39:15] and they're regularly uh creating events
[39:19] in the Bitcoin Hotel the infamous bitco
[39:22] hotel nearby stutgart and in pingan is
[39:26] it and uh they are inviting a lot of
[39:29] bitcoiners in the space and um yeah
[39:32] having a Meetup several I think two
[39:36] several days uh and two nights and so on
[39:39] and then you can connect with other
[39:41] women also there and uh talk about
[39:44] Bitcoin and how it works and there are
[39:46] also workshops and how you practice
[39:48] doing Bitcoin and what they also do I
[39:51] think is bit at Big Bitcoin events they
[39:55] organize Community meetups yeah just
[39:57] looked at I think end of July or like
[40:00] very soon actually yeah in three days it
[40:03] seems like there's the the next one in
[40:05] in in hotel
[40:07] Blan do when do you plan to to broadcast
[40:11] uh after that okay good you can say
[40:14] three days yeah so uh it already
[40:19] happened like it's it's uh uh the same
[40:21] time the Bitcoin in Nashville uh the big
[40:24] conference in Nashville Tennessee is
[40:26] also happening be also really
[40:28] interesting to to see Trump talking
[40:30] about Bitcoin and all the things whole
[40:32] whole different conference at last far
[40:35] but I would actually be probably rather
[40:38] at Les
[40:40] from yeah I can I can definitely
[40:42] recommend Li marage and there's a really
[40:46] good feeling and a good atmosphere there
[40:48] so absolutely absolutely um uh before we
[40:53] come to the end routine um you come from
[40:55] the traditional uh cial space do you
[40:58] think um the traditional Financial space
[41:01] Will Survive or better question what
[41:04] parts of the traditional Financial space
[41:08] like we have ETFs we have the uh
[41:10] Exchange Market with have all those
[41:12] things will will they all survive and
[41:16] just be a little bit different on a
[41:17] Bitcoin standard or how do you see like
[41:19] this uh thing evolving over the next
[41:22] like 20 years obviously impossible to
[41:25] answer a question but it's always fun to
[41:28] speculate I hope they will not not
[41:30] survive in this form uh I think there
[41:34] there always be some room for really
[41:36] Bank stor so that they go there and ask
[41:40] someone for I don't know for for advice
[41:43] how to set up your wallet or even ask
[41:48] someone and you pay them one how to plan
[41:52] your um
[41:54] your heritage um and also give it to
[41:58] your children and there will also be
[42:00] room for really storing your Hardware
[42:03] wallet your physical Hardware wallet I
[42:05] think this is very important Service uh
[42:08] options and that still will still will
[42:11] be there in the Bitcoin standard and
[42:13] it's really really important and was
[42:15] really important in the past but there's
[42:17] such a big part of the bank and finance
[42:20] part that won't be very important
[42:23] anymore uh especially the tight
[42:26] connection between Finance and State and
[42:29] this is the the thing that is most
[42:31] worrying so that the state state always
[42:34] bail outs the banks and disconnections
[42:37] disconnection will not be anymore and I
[42:39] think that's why we are going to have a
[42:41] world that it's
[42:43] peaceful and uh not so stressed more um
[42:48] sustainable because you do not buy
[42:51] everything because you can have a
[42:53] credit and uh this give would would
[42:58] remove a lot of friction and I think we
[43:00] only discovered that if we are there and
[43:03] on the way it slowly gets better and
[43:05] better but I think it will not be the
[43:07] same like today it will be definitely uh
[43:10] changed a lot I also feel like that um
[43:13] last question before the end team that I
[43:16] give to every one of my guests um what
[43:18] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[43:21] you can learn from me how to write
[43:24] articles that are visible I on the
[43:28] internet I love it perfect that that's a
[43:31] very good skill

[43:44] guest is asking a question for the next
[43:45] guest without knowing who the next guest

[43:49] what's one thing that you do that keeps
[43:52] you from having big regrets in life this

[44:12] determine like what's what's worthwhile
[44:14] to do right
