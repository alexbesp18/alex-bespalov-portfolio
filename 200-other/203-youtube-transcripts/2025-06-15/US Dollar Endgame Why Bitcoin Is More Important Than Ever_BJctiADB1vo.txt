[00:00] the only reason that we see Rise of
[00:01] price in an economy is when you had more
[00:03] money I read the Kagen book that's the
[00:05] guy who coined our very arbitrary
[00:08] hyperinflation definition that we have
[00:10] which is 50% per month 50% per month
[00:12] seems high but it's even worse than you
[00:15] think if you put it annually over a year
[00:17] it's 12,000 per per year when you have a
[00:19] banana for two in the beginning of the
[00:22] year that same banana will be 250 in the
[00:25] end of the year with 50% inflation per
[00:27] month which is completely insane people
[00:30] are dumping that money for anything else
[00:32] could be gold could be other currencies
[00:35] could be cars could be any Goods in the
[00:37] economy that is worth something when
[00:39] that happen you get to hyperinflation
[00:41] the only thing that could trigger some
[00:43] kind of hyperinflation in United States
[00:44] would be the L of the world Reserve
[00:47] currency it's the illusion that the
[00:49] cental bank can control the inflation
[00:51] the money is made on debt you have to
[00:53] create more money every years to pay the
[00:55] interest 20 years ago a house in my
[00:57] country would be worth a $100,000 and
[00:59] now it's
[01:00] $600,000 I'm going to rush and spend all
[01:03] my money to buy Goods that's monetary
[01:05] substitution that's the point where you
[01:07] get to eye inflation at 2% inflation per
[01:09] year for 30 year double your prices you
[01:12] can keep fat system working as long as
[01:15] the population accept it that's the
[01:16] origin of the world
[01:18] [Music]
[01:22] dollar you have some artifacts and I
[01:24] want to get to them also if you have
[01:26] them uh do you have ready yeah of course
[01:29] of course I have them right right here
[01:31] I'm always ready everywhere I go I bring
[01:33] this little this little uh uh pocket and
[01:38] uh there's there's plenty of artifacts
[01:40] in there uh from uh yeah from from uh
[01:44] Germany from Hungary uh from some from
[01:48] Austria too um and yes basically I have
[01:51] uh in my big collection here I have uh
[01:54] bills
[01:55] from uh about near close to 40 I
[01:59] inflation out out of the
[02:01] 57 official hyperinflations that happen
[02:06] um in the world everywhere in the world
[02:08] uh so yeah so I'm I've been collecting
[02:11] those bills for about five years now uh
[02:13] so I'm lurking basically lurking eBay in
[02:16] eBay and every time I see a bill with a
[02:20] lot of zero on it I I study the um the
[02:23] period and the country where where it it
[02:25] come from it comes from and uh and I had
[02:28] it to my my collection yep what have you
[02:30] learned so so far from from studying all
[02:33] those hyperinflation currencies yeah I
[02:35] finally learned what is hyperinflation
[02:39] because um when we talk about inflation
[02:41] and hyperinflation we always have a
[02:44] semantic or or definition problem you
[02:48] know so inflation for some people is
[02:50] like the inflation of the monetary Mass
[02:52] which is basically the the correct uh
[02:55] definition but we can't use that um if
[02:58] we talked about
[03:00] inflation um with Economist or with uh
[03:04] Del laymen because uh for them inflation
[03:08] is uh the um the global well the the
[03:13] global rise in price in the economy
[03:16] which is the definition I use because um
[03:20] because it's the it's the effect that
[03:22] everybody sees so we can talk about the
[03:25] effect in its its cause um that Whata
[03:30] that we can debate on what caused the um
[03:32] the global price uh on on on uh like on
[03:36] all the economy the global price rise
[03:40] sorry in the economy uh but basically
[03:43] it's always uh because of the um the the
[03:47] growth on the monetary Mass because uh
[03:50] simply simply put if if the price right
[03:54] if you have a fixed monetary Mass
[03:56] basically like like the gold standard
[03:58] let's say it's was almost fixed while
[04:00] like let's say 1% inflation per per year
[04:04] because of the mining of new gold so
[04:06] let's say it's practically fixed so if
[04:09] you have price rise in some sectors of
[04:11] the economy you you will have um is the
[04:15] price rise here the price will go down
[04:17] on the other sectors because there's not
[04:19] more money you it's a it's the the the
[04:24] the the purchasing power that people are
[04:26] losing because the energy is is uh price
[04:29] are higher or or I don't know rent
[04:31] prices are higher they will lose it for
[04:34] other sectors so they so I don't know
[04:36] the foods uh they will have less money
[04:39] for food they will have less money to
[04:40] travel and and and all all those sector
[04:43] will will see less demand so price are
[04:46] will will go down the only reason that
[04:48] we see Glo General R rise of price in an
[04:53] economy is when you had more money so
[04:56] price go up in a sector and the price
[04:58] don't go down in the other SE sectors
[05:00] because people have access to credit uh
[05:02] government create more money via money
[05:05] printing so you add money to the economy
[05:07] so every uh price in the economy can go
[05:10] up and cause what we call inflation uh
[05:13] so that's basically uh what happened if
[05:16] you have an energy shock let's in like
[05:18] in the 70s without adding money you'll
[05:21] have price RIS in everywhere you use
[05:24] energy and and and other sectors will
[05:27] will have uh their price going down
[05:29] because it will be less demand because
[05:31] people will have less purchasing power
[05:34] so that's how I I can explain what uh
[05:38] inflation is and why it's the um rise uh
[05:42] of the monetary mass that let it happen
[05:46] if if you don't have money you won't
[05:48] have a general rise in price in the all
[05:52] economy it's impossible it's
[05:53] mathematically impossible it's not to
[05:55] say that if you fix the the monetary
[05:58] Mass you won't have price Rises and and
[06:01] everybody would keep their Pur power no
[06:04] of course if there's a energy shock like
[06:06] in the 70s um the quality of living will
[06:09] go down because energy will be more
[06:12] expensive uh but people will have
[06:14] choices to do and the money will go to
[06:17] the place where the price will rise and
[06:20] it will it won't go the purchas power
[06:22] will go down and and you will see price
[06:25] going down in other sectors so it's some
[06:28] some some bit corers say like oh if we
[06:31] have Bitcoin we won have inflation yeah
[06:34] true we we won't have CPI inflation
[06:38] because um prices are not go will not go
[06:41] up in general the whole economy but we
[06:45] can lose purchasing power if we have an
[06:47] energy shock or if we have a uh if the
[06:50] crops are destroyed by by bugs or by
[06:54] weather whatever so so it's the the the
[06:58] purchasing power thing still uh exist
[07:01] even if you fix the monitor Mass yeah so
[07:04] that that that was my whole explanation
[07:05] sorry I talk a lot but uh I that's a
[07:09] subject that that passionate me and and
[07:11] it's hard to talk about that because e
[07:13] if an economist from a from um
[07:16] university hear me talking will say
[07:18] that's all but I mean it's
[07:20] super simple you get what I mean is if
[07:23] you have if you put more money here
[07:25] you'll have less money for for the other
[07:28] sectors and if if you don't if you had
[07:30] money well price will continue to go up
[07:32] on every sector because the money is
[07:34] there if you don't add money you will
[07:36] have price rise here and pricing going
[07:38] down on the other sector that that's it
[07:41] that's how I explain what is the
[07:42] difference between um inflation price
[07:45] rise and L of perc in power that's
[07:49] that's the whole three concept right
[07:51] there I think more and more normal
[07:54] economists um are waking up to that fact
[07:57] uh it's it's like they have a to unlearn
[08:00] they they learned as a student in
[08:03] University that kesan economics they
[08:05] learned then as a professor more they
[08:08] studied in that they are so deeply in
[08:10] there that it's really hard to get out
[08:12] there and I have a lot of empathy for
[08:14] that but I think they slowly start to
[08:17] get it like like I I I really have a lot
[08:21] of Hope for for that that they also know
[08:25] mathematics and and simple logic and
[08:29] they're like okay it's not does not work
[08:31] like that and I think Bitcoin is the
[08:34] first really big thing that shows us
[08:37] that before Bitcoin there was no exit
[08:39] wealth for that so that's really
[08:40] interesting to see um one question you
[08:43] started so many H inflated
[08:46] currencies do you think that every
[08:49] currency that is controlled by a central
[08:51] entity will eventually hyperinflate is
[08:54] this an inevitability yeah uh in fact no
[08:59] uh uh but that's what I learned from my
[09:01] research and I had to read um well at
[09:04] first I read the Kagen book The that's
[09:07] the guy who um who coed the the AR very
[09:12] arbitrary hyperinflation definition that
[09:14] we have which is 50% per month and 50%
[09:17] per month seems I I I know it seems high
[09:20] but it's even worse than you think when
[09:22] you look at the 50% per month number
[09:24] you're like wow 50% per month that's big
[09:27] but in a year if you put it annually
[09:29] over a year it's 12,000 per 12,000 per
[09:34] per year because of compound's interest
[09:36] you know our compound work so that it's
[09:39] exponential basically so 50 uh by 50 by
[09:43] 50 by 50 it's end up 12 times end up as
[09:46] a 12,000 per inflation so it's way too
[09:50] high to describe inflation it's a way
[09:52] way too high I mean there was
[09:54] hyperinflation that happened in some
[09:57] country that destroyed the currency in
[09:59] the Country economy that didn't reach um
[10:02] 50% per month at all I mean there's
[10:05] basically two hyperinflation that
[10:06] happens uh in United States uh first
[10:11] during the uh war of
[10:13] independence um in
[10:16] 1776 I if I remember
[10:18] correctly and then there was another uh
[10:21] one during the Civil War so that's
[10:23] that's a bill from the the Civil War
[10:25] that's the a Confederate bill and this
[10:28] money this is a $2 a $2 confederate from
[10:32] um 1865 I think or 1862 anyway so during
[10:36] the Civil War in the United States and
[10:39] they they had a month with 40% inflation
[10:41] so they're not on the list uh but it it
[10:44] it was hyperinflation basically the the
[10:46] money was was completely destroyed and
[10:49] uh I have a bill here somewhere there it
[10:52] is that's that's a uh that's um um
[10:56] Colonial bill from United States before
[10:59] was United States while it was a a
[11:02] England colony uh so this is from
[11:05] Connecticut is paper money and some
[11:07] paper money like that in in well the
[11:10] Continental uh bill that's the money
[11:12] that appears right after this one uh did
[11:15] hyperinflate to 47% per month for while
[11:18] during one month so it's not on the list
[11:20] but for me it's amplifi so what is
[11:22] hyperinflation it's basically uh um when
[11:26] you you get to money you get to a point
[11:28] or where you get get monetary
[11:30] substitution that's the key and what is
[11:33] monetary substitution you'll ask me well
[11:36] it's it's simple it's when people are
[11:39] stop using uh the money and try to use
[11:43] anything else as money so the money in
[11:46] hyperinflation are undervalued that's
[11:50] really weird because there's so much
[11:53] money well it's because there's a lot of
[11:56] money like at face value there's a lot
[11:59] of zeros but the money is undervalued
[12:03] because people are dumping that money
[12:05] for anything else could be uh like uh
[12:08] gold could be other other currencies
[12:11] could be cars could be any any Goods in
[12:13] the economy that is worth something
[12:15] people are dumping the money so while
[12:17] that while when that happen you get to
[12:20] hyperinflation because um because of
[12:22] expectations so the the money is
[12:25] undervalued and as as and while people
[12:29] people are dumping the money it's it's
[12:31] uh always more undervalued and it's uh a
[12:35] vicious circle you call that in English
[12:37] sorry it's you know vious cycle right
[12:39] Vis cycle exactly and um and you end up
[12:43] with money that is destroyed so your
[12:46] question was Can it can it happen to any
[12:50] currency well uh there's there's uh
[12:54] there's like seven currency in the world
[12:57] that are sovereign like U um US Dollar
[13:00] Canadian dollar uh Australian dollar um
[13:04] there's also a the Japan Yen there
[13:07] there's some currencies like that that
[13:09] they are sovereign so what is a
[13:10] sovereign currency it's just a currency
[13:14] it's just a country that can uh uh
[13:17] leverage his um debt in his own currency
[13:22] so Canada can do that United States can
[13:25] do that it's not all the country it's
[13:26] just about seven country in the world so
[13:28] those country won't go it's it's it's
[13:32] hard for them to go in hyperinflation
[13:34] because when you get when you get a lot
[13:37] of inflation U you start uh to leverage
[13:40] your uh debt in uh other currency uh
[13:45] because you have to buy to import things
[13:48] so your debt will be denominated in
[13:50] another currency so while your currency
[13:52] devaluate you can't pay back your bet
[13:55] your debt because it take more and more
[13:57] of your local currency to pay back your
[13:59] external debt so that's one of the
[14:01] problem of hyperinflation you don't get
[14:03] that if you're in Canada because we have
[14:06] we we we we uh we have our debt in our
[14:08] own currency so while our currency is
[14:10] going down in value our debt is also
[14:13] going down in value so you can fix the
[14:15] debt Problem by printing more money if
[14:18] you do that and you don't have monetary
[14:20] sovereignty you're gonna kill the money
[14:23] for sure because you your debt is going
[14:25] to be uh your external debt is going to
[14:27] be higher and higher and compared to the
[14:29] value of your money so any country that
[14:32] doesn't have monetary sovereignty that
[14:34] and and that have economical like
[14:37] problem in their economy can have
[14:39] hyperinflation because they will borrow
[14:42] more money from from other country to
[14:45] fix their problem and their money is
[14:47] going to devaluate and it will be a
[14:49] vious cycle again and they're G to end
[14:51] up with hyperinflation when the monetary
[14:54] sub substitution happen that's where you
[14:57] get to hyperinflation and it can happen
[14:59] way before 50% per month that's that's
[15:01] an arbit arbitrary number that's way too
[15:03] high and in Canada and United States
[15:07] well basically uh when you get into a
[15:11] debt problem you just print more money
[15:12] your debt uh devalue and you can pay it
[15:15] back with pretent money so that's a fix
[15:17] but you'll get a lot of inflation in
[15:19] exchange but you won't reach the
[15:21] monetary substitution that's where you
[15:24] end up to hyperinflation the only thing
[15:27] that could trigger some kind of
[15:29] inflation in United States would be the
[15:31] Lost of the world Reserve currency
[15:35] because all the the US dollars that are
[15:38] everywhere in the world um basically um
[15:42] making the world economy because that's
[15:44] a world Reserve currency well if we stop
[15:46] using that to make trade deals and
[15:48] buying oil uh well uh all this all those
[15:53] US dollar will come back to the United
[15:55] States and the size of the economy of
[15:58] the United States is way too small to
[16:00] accommodate all the US dollar that exist
[16:02] today so it could it could make a lot of
[16:06] inflation I don't know I'm not an
[16:07] economist I could not do the the the
[16:09] math to tell you if it would reach
[16:12] hyperinflation and monetary substitution
[16:14] but that could be a big problem imagine
[16:15] that I don't know maybe the size of the
[16:18] world econom is like let's say let's say
[16:20] I don't know exactly but three times the
[16:22] size of the the United States economy
[16:25] well well imagine that three times uh
[16:27] well imagine that there's three times
[16:29] too much money you US dollars in the
[16:31] United States you'll end up with a lot
[16:33] of inflation it will be way too much
[16:34] money in the system so that's one way
[16:37] that uh US dollar could reach something
[16:39] that looks like hyperinflation but
[16:42] basically to conclude any country that
[16:44] have monetarist sovereignty it's hard
[16:46] for them to reachal inflation and second
[16:49] second part is that let's say Canada we
[16:52] have like natural resources that people
[16:54] want to buy so there there's there's
[16:56] always there will always be some other
[16:58] country that will buy Canadian dollars
[17:00] to buy our resources like uh uh like
[17:03] wood um uh like beef like wheat we we
[17:06] have those resources and the example for
[17:08] that is the Zimbabwe they had
[17:11] hyperinflation but before they had
[17:12] hyperinflation they were uh they were uh
[17:15] producing a lot of Agro um product you
[17:18] know they had a lot of Agriculture there
[17:21] and they were exporting a lot something
[17:23] happened in the country that that breaks
[17:25] that and that's when they got into
[17:27] hyperinflation because nobody would were
[17:30] no external country were buying their
[17:32] currency to buy their goods so that's
[17:34] what happened the their their their
[17:36] their money crumbled and they were they
[17:38] had to buy external debt to pay for to
[17:41] import instead of exporting that's it
[17:44] will we then always have also feat
[17:47] currencies when when when when there are
[17:49] certain types of uh currencies that
[17:52] never hyper inflate uh will they then
[17:55] always be there in in in in our system
[17:58] sorry I didn't get that you said if if
[18:01] feat currencies then will always exist
[18:03] also well I I'm I'm not sure um I'm not
[18:07] sure about that I
[18:09] mean well let's say the country that
[18:12] have real monetary sovereignty they
[18:14] won't they won't let that that power go
[18:17] okay they easily I mean Canada United
[18:20] States uh Japan Japan's only work the
[18:23] country is only working because they
[18:25] have monetary sovereignty if if they
[18:27] wouldn't have that it would be they
[18:29] would be uh bankrupt you know they they
[18:32] just create more and more money to pay
[18:34] their debt and they can't do that
[18:35] because they have monetary sovereignty
[18:38] their as as much as they print their
[18:40] debt value is going down because they're
[18:43] printing so they can they can survive
[18:46] like this a lot so they won't drop that
[18:48] anytime soon but any country that have a
[18:50] fiat currency that is not sovereign that
[18:54] that what that means is that they cannot
[18:56] uh their debt are in let's say US dollar
[19:00] their their money might disappear we
[19:03] have a lot of um we have a lot of
[19:05] example of that we have eador Ecuador uh
[19:10] that are is dollarized we have um
[19:13] Salvador that is uh dollarized so those
[19:16] country when when they when they reach a
[19:19] point that they are they have a lot of
[19:21] inflation they have two choice they
[19:23] created new money like uh they did that
[19:26] in Hungary they did that in Zimbabwe boy
[19:29] uh they did that in Germany when they
[19:31] fixed the hyper inflation in Germany
[19:32] they create a new mark That's it France
[19:35] did that too uh they had a lot of
[19:37] inflation at some point they created the
[19:39] new Frank so that's one way to fix I
[19:43] inflation or R inflation or
[19:45] hyperinflation and the other way is just
[19:46] to drop out the fat and then dollarize
[19:49] and use the US dollar so you stop
[19:51] inflation because you won't be the the
[19:54] government in place won't be able to
[19:57] print the money to fin the government
[19:59] that's that's what happened when when
[20:01] you get hyperinflation it's just simply
[20:03] because the government is using the
[20:05] printer the money printing machines to
[20:07] finance the government that's it that
[20:09] that that's what happen at every in in
[20:12] every hyperinflation and if you
[20:14] dollarize you stop that the government
[20:17] cannot make choices uh and the choices
[20:20] of printing money they just have to use
[20:23] what resources they have um and and
[20:26] that's it that stop the hyperinflation
[20:29] basically it's super interesting by the
[20:31] way I uh next to you talking I was
[20:34] researching like how detrimental a 50%
[20:37] inflation rate for per month actually is
[20:39] and it's like I I always try to make it
[20:42] um uh visible what what that means uh
[20:46] and I just did the math with JD hope
[20:50] it's it's not not wrong but I think it
[20:52] should be all right when you have a
[20:54] banana for two EUR in the end in the
[20:56] beginning of the year that same banana
[20:58] will be € 250 EUR right around that uh
[21:01] price point in the end of the year with
[21:03] 50% inflation per month which is
[21:07] completely
[21:09] insane yes that this this happens and
[21:11] it's it's it's like that's a high
[21:14] inflation rate yes it is and and in
[21:16] Zimbabwe we have a lot of example of
[21:18] that I read during my research I read
[21:20] like three books or four books about Hy
[21:22] inflation in Zimbabwe and two of them
[21:24] were but well one of them was very very
[21:26] interesting was a a CEO of a retail
[21:28] chain um and was describing that at one
[21:32] point the the suppliers were um didn't
[21:35] want to be paid 30 30 days later you
[21:38] know because there was so much inflation
[21:40] that in 30 days the money would B
[21:42] basically zero like literally zero so
[21:45] what the what the suppliers said was
[21:48] that okay uh we you can pay in 30 days
[21:51] but you'll you'll pay the rate of of uh
[21:54] the money that we we with the the rate
[21:57] of inflation
[21:59] of in 30 days but right now so let's say
[22:02] you have a a pair of shoes that is worth
[22:04] $4 million in in Zimbabwean dollar and
[22:08] and they with the inflation at that time
[22:11] it would in 30 days it would the money
[22:13] would well the shoes would be worth 70
[22:15] million so so the inflation rate right
[22:18] now is is the shoes are are4 million uh
[22:22] Dollar in 30 days going to be 70 so the
[22:25] supplier will Char 70 million right now
[22:28] so instead of selling the shoes right
[22:30] now for let's say 20 million the the
[22:32] store have to to sell the shoes for
[22:35] let's say 150 million so the
[22:37] anticipation of inflation accelerates
[22:40] the rate of inflation uh that's why I
[22:43] said the money earlier I said the
[22:45] problem with hyperinflation or high infl
[22:48] very high inflation is that the money is
[22:50] undervalue that's an example right there
[22:53] on why the money could be undervalued is
[22:56] that you apply the
[22:59] of the next 30 days to the price right
[23:01] now because of your supplier uh won't
[23:04] accept to be paid 30day later and you
[23:06] say well they just have to pay right now
[23:09] they will say well that's not how
[23:11] business works the the the the COO there
[23:14] didn't have the liquidity to pay uh up
[23:17] front for the shoes he had to wait to
[23:19] sell the shoes and then pay back the
[23:21] supplier so this logic there in
[23:23] hyperinflation can't work so you have to
[23:26] include the the inflation upfront in the
[23:29] price so it caus a vicious circle right
[23:32] there again it's interesting even
[23:35] in uh because um my podcast has sponsors
[23:40] and and I also we usually do like two
[23:43] three four five months periods uh and
[23:46] this is even like if you if if if both
[23:50] are kind of Bitcoin companies and both
[23:52] have like I have my treasury of course
[23:54] in Bitcoin and they also have part or
[23:57] most of the treasury in Bitcoin uh then
[24:00] the point of payment is way more
[24:03] relevant than it it used to be I I came
[24:05] from the Fiat World in it security solds
[24:08] it security uh Services inflation was
[24:11] only uh a topic to discuss if the
[24:15] contract was over one year so uh I
[24:19] remember negotiating for a really big uh
[24:22] fiveyear contract around like half a
[24:25] million volume their inflation really
[24:28] was a topic because uh there was like a
[24:31] service we had to bring in five years
[24:35] and they have now a fixed price but only
[24:38] pay in in in in in five years time maybe
[24:41] this payment doesn't pay the employees
[24:43] that bring the service then so uh it's
[24:46] it's really funny how how these things
[24:50] come together already now imagine in a
[24:53] hyperinflation scenario yep exactly and
[24:56] and that's why Economist says that
[24:58] inflation is not a problem if we can
[25:01] forecast it that's one of their point
[25:03] and they're they're kind of right if if
[25:06] the contract forecast the let's say 2%
[25:08] inflation that's that's not really a
[25:11] problem but the thing is is it's the
[25:13] illusion that the central bank can
[25:16] control the inflation that's basically
[25:18] an illusion because because in the the
[25:21] the
[25:22] 2010s they they were trying to reach the
[25:24] 2% but they were not even reaching it
[25:27] they were saying that we don't have
[25:29] enough inflation they were basically
[25:30] telling us we're we're going to have to
[25:32] revise our our targets higher because
[25:35] we're not even able to reach the 2%
[25:38] inflation and and for all your viewers
[25:40] the Central Bank role is not to control
[25:43] inflation not go to ey the Central Bank
[25:46] role is to create some inflation at
[25:49] least 1% so your house is not worth less
[25:52] every year because in in a in a normal
[25:56] economy with a fixed uh uh money uh
[25:59] money supply you would get deflation
[26:02] it's it's it's normal you would you
[26:05] would get deflation because population
[26:07] is growing and the the the countries are
[26:10] producing more if you don't put more
[26:12] money in the system everything's gonna
[26:15] uh the price are gonna are going to go
[26:18] down and that's normal but because of
[26:21] the the crisis of the the 30s people are
[26:24] scared of deflation they don't
[26:26] understand it very well they always
[26:28] identify that as a like in a credit
[26:31] Bubble Burst like in the the 30s well
[26:34] 1929 um but basically a growth deflation
[26:38] is is is normal it it did happen in 19th
[26:41] century in the 19th century we had a
[26:43] gold standard and we had deflation
[26:45] growth deflation so so all that to say
[26:49] that the role of a central bank is not
[26:51] to limit the inflation like at at at
[26:54] let's say 2% it's to reach 2% so the
[26:59] whole um Financial system don't don't go
[27:02] go down because imagine that the house
[27:05] of every person in in the world going
[27:08] down 1% per year in price it would not
[27:11] work with our current system in our
[27:13] current system because the money is B on
[27:15] on debt you have to create more money
[27:18] every years to pay the interest that's
[27:20] normal I mean I'm what what I mean that
[27:23] is I'm not for that system but what I
[27:25] mean is they have to create more money
[27:27] to weigh the interest because every
[27:30] dollar that is created is a debt you
[27:32] have a percentage of Interest applied to
[27:34] it so in our current system you have to
[27:37] create inflation for the system to work
[27:39] but that's not to say that for an
[27:42] economy to work you need to add
[27:43] inflation no in the fat system yes but
[27:46] in in a let's say in a gold standard you
[27:48] don't have to create inflation for the
[27:50] system to work you're G you're going to
[27:51] end up with deflation and basically in
[27:54] the whole history of the
[27:56] world um the price were very stable like
[28:00] if you go back to Roman time and and uh
[28:03] if you go in um Medieval Time prices
[28:05] were very stable and there was one part
[28:09] of history that is called the Great uh
[28:12] ah sorry I don't remember in in English
[28:14] but um there there was a a part of
[28:17] history when the uh the Spaniards went
[28:20] to um Americas discovered the Amer well
[28:24] not discovered it was already there but
[28:26] you know when they went to America
[28:28] because and um and they brought back
[28:31] precious metal they created inflation in
[28:34] Europe and it's called the Great PRI the
[28:36] great the price Revolution basically the
[28:39] price changed for 1% per year there
[28:42] there was an inflation of 1% per year
[28:43] and it was called price Revolution
[28:46] because the price didn't change back in
[28:49] those days why because of gold the gold
[28:52] uh was uh had a 1% in natural inflation
[28:56] uh because of mining every year and it
[28:59] was about enough to compensate for the
[29:03] population growth and you know uh more
[29:06] product more productivity so the price
[29:08] were very stable and when the Spaniard
[29:10] discovered all the metal the precious
[29:12] metal in americaas they disrupt the
[29:15] whole price system there uh and it
[29:18] caused um a um a period that was called
[29:21] the the price Revolution so basically if
[29:24] you don't don't have a Bank Central Bank
[29:26] creating more money and you have
[29:29] a monetary system that is kind of fixed
[29:32] fixed sorry well uh you there's no
[29:35] reason you have price increase you you
[29:36] should have price uh deflation basically
[29:40] that's that's the normal thing and then
[29:42] people will say well what what will we
[29:43] do with the salaries of course at some
[29:46] point salaries will need to go down but
[29:48] your procing power would go up so I
[29:51] don't know if I get 10% more processing
[29:53] power uh over let's say five years it's
[29:57] okay if I get a pay cut of 5% you know
[29:59] you you're you're you're you have more
[30:01] processing power the nominal number
[30:05] doesn't matter at all I mean houses five
[30:10] I don't know 10 sorry 20 years ago a
[30:13] house in my country would be worth 1,000
[30:16] $100,000 Canadian dollar and now it's
[30:20] $600,000 so it's the same house so the
[30:24] nominal price doesn't matter it's the
[30:27] it's the thing you can buy that matters
[30:30] so so what it means is not that the
[30:33] house is better it's just that the money
[30:34] is got devaluated so the nominal number
[30:38] doesn't matter it's just what you can
[30:39] buy the things the goods you can buy
[30:42] with your Precision Power that's what
[30:43] matters so if you if your money is went
[30:45] if your money is worth 10% more imagine
[30:48] all your your um the money you have
[30:51] saved is wor is worth 10 10% more and
[30:54] you get a 5% pay cut that's fine I
[30:58] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[31:01] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[31:04] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[31:07] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[31:10] vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch
[31:13] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[31:16] go out there and show that you are a
[31:18] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[31:21] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[31:24] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:27] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:30] collections you have the date of the
[31:32] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[31:35] and of course also the block height and
[31:38] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[31:41] the level of detail they put in in this
[31:44] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[31:46] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:50] down in the descriptions I love those
[31:52] watches so so much if you watch or
[31:55] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:57] is I guess you already bought some
[32:00] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[32:02] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[32:06] in a hardware wallet my personal
[32:08] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[32:10] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[32:12] to set up it's also a perfect gift for a
[32:14] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[32:17] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[32:21] with the code Robin at the checkout
[32:23] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[32:27] your bitbox and the next step is to
[32:30] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:32] individual you have to have the most
[32:34] secure self- custody setup you have to
[32:37] secure your own devices you have to
[32:40] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:43] an inherent plan and depending on where
[32:45] you live you even want to have a plan B
[32:48] a citizenship where you can move in case
[32:51] something goes really really wrong and
[32:53] through all those steps the Bitcoin way
[32:55] is guiding you through step by step and
[32:58] if you visit the Bitcoin way.com SLP
[33:01] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[33:04] minute free call to find out how you can
[33:07] level up your sovereignty absolutely and
[33:11] I just looked it up because of it's all
[33:12] over Twitter also um Pro it's a new
[33:16] alltime high for Bitcoin in in Canada
[33:18] right now so it's reached the first time
[33:20] ever the over 100,000 per per per coin
[33:24] right in yeah we reached the uh the the
[33:28] the magic number of
[33:30] 1,000k per per Bitcoin so so yeah it's
[33:33] still need you still need six Bitcoin to
[33:35] buy a house in in Canada so so maybe I
[33:39] don't know maybe in five years it's
[33:40] going to be I don't know two Bitcoin
[33:43] three Bitcoin one Bitcoin I don't know
[33:45] so that's that's that's how you can
[33:47] measure uh well Bitcoin is kind of
[33:50] deflationary there is still there's
[33:52] still inflation because we we mine more
[33:55] Bitcoin every 10 minutes right but but
[33:59] uh at some point it's going to be fixed
[34:01] so so it's normal that um that things
[34:05] will be uh priced things priced in
[34:09] Bitcoin uh will will go the price pric
[34:12] in Bitcoin will go down because uh well
[34:15] because we have more productivity more
[34:17] people and and and Bitcoin is is limited
[34:20] so exactly like the go cender was in the
[34:22] 19th century there's no reason that the
[34:25] the price of things uh well price of
[34:28] things should go should go down when
[34:31] they're measured in Bitcoin yeah I I
[34:34] love measuring things in Bitcoin it
[34:35] makes the world seem to be oh yeah
[34:38] everything is getting cheaper it's a
[34:40] really positive outlook but it's also
[34:41] funny with the salary I I actually
[34:44] talked about that on other podcast with
[34:46] with someone who asked me what is the
[34:47] most unexpected thing that will happen
[34:50] on a Bitcoin stand and and I was like
[34:51] people are not ready to have a salary
[34:53] cut in nominal terms they will have a
[34:56] real the will have more purchasing power
[34:59] it's a funny thing people uh probably um
[35:03] like it more to have less purchasing
[35:05] power but more nominal than the other
[35:07] way around which absolutely makes no
[35:10] sense at all make no sense uh but that's
[35:13] a human that's a human brain for you
[35:15] like that that's that's uh that will be
[35:17] an interesting time if because I already
[35:21] I'm I I will measure that uh it's my
[35:24] first year of podcasting I get uh paid
[35:28] uh in in Bitcoin but I also get paid in
[35:30] in feat because yeah YouTube and and
[35:32] Twitter is not paying me in Bitcoin uh
[35:35] and I will convert everything in Bitcoin
[35:38] and say like okay that's how many
[35:39] Bitcoin I earned in the first year of
[35:41] podcasting I think it will be really
[35:43] hard for me to grow my income in Bitcoin
[35:46] terms over the next five to 10 years and
[35:49] grow have the same income in 20 34 then
[35:53] in 2024 that will be that if if I
[35:56] achieve that I achieved a lot of think
[35:59] yes of course yeah of course you're
[36:01] going to for your project you're of
[36:03] course going to get a pay cut in Bitcoin
[36:05] of course because I don't know the price
[36:07] in of Bitcoin in five years but uh if it
[36:10] continue to go up like is it's doing
[36:13] right now well I mean uh you would be
[36:16] really rich if you get paid the same
[36:18] amount of Bitcoin that you're paid right
[36:20] now in five year in five years of course
[36:23] it motivates me I I I I want to have the
[36:25] same income in 10 years as I have this
[36:27] year perfect let's try that yeah CU well
[36:31] your channel can grow basically so it is
[36:34] possible that it is possible that you
[36:36] get the same amount of Bitcoin in five
[36:38] years or 10 years but you'll have to
[36:40] grow your your channel right that's
[36:42] that's the thing that that's perfect I I
[36:44] hope you get it probably one advantage
[36:47] that I have is that my channel is about
[36:50] Bitcoin and that my channel gets more
[36:52] interest when Bitcoin is also getting
[36:54] more interest in the Chan population so
[36:57] maybe have an effect there but let's see
[36:59] that's a virtuous cycle there that's
[37:01] perfect I like that that's
[37:04] virtuous it's
[37:06] um it's a it's a loop yeah really cool
[37:09] but back to the topic of of
[37:10] hyperinflation yes um when you measure
[37:14] when when you see all those studies of
[37:16] like currency this that hyperinflated
[37:18] and we talked a little bit about before
[37:20] but um is there a metric an event or
[37:25] like the the the Tipping Point between
[37:27] normal inflation and oh we have
[37:30] hyper inflation the Tipping Point
[37:32] between most people say Yeah it's
[37:35] annoying that the prices R uh go up a
[37:38] little bit and like oh I cannot
[37:41] afford anything right now and I will
[37:43] Rush as soon as possible uh and get
[37:46] everything that I can buy you're
[37:48] describing it that's exactly it the
[37:50] point where you you you you go from Norm
[37:54] let's
[37:55] say normal inflation can be quite ey you
[37:59] know let's say 10% inflation is not ey
[38:02] inflation okay uh it's it's just like um
[38:06] moderate well it's called basically
[38:08] technically it's called moderate
[38:09] inflation and moderate inflation doesn't
[38:11] mean it's low inflation it just mean
[38:13] that that the economy and the people can
[38:15] tolerate it okay annually sorry oh when
[38:19] I say 10% it's annually yeah yeah it's
[38:21] annually so so moderate inflation is
[38:24] basically just um psychological thing
[38:26] that that you just mean that the economy
[38:28] and the people would would would
[38:30] tolerate it and not reach the point that
[38:33] they're going to be monetary
[38:34] substitution so what you describe there
[38:36] is say oh I'm G to rush and spend all my
[38:39] money to buy Goods that's monetary
[38:41] substitution that's the point where you
[38:42] get to I inflation so hyperinflation and
[38:46] I inflation is exactly the same thing
[38:48] it's just hyperinflation is 50% per
[38:50] month because of the Kagen guy that coin
[38:53] that and basically why it's 50% it's so
[38:56] so simple he studied seven
[38:58] hyperinflation and the three lower
[39:01] hyperinflation that he studied out of
[39:03] the seven was 50 about 50% per month so
[39:07] he said in in his conclusion said well
[39:10] when it reached that it you can come
[39:13] back from ipon you cannot fix the When
[39:17] You Reach 50% per month ipon fishion
[39:19] cannot be fixed by normal means you have
[39:21] to uh change the currency or dollarize
[39:25] okay so so that that's that was his
[39:26] conclusion that's why he coined the 50%
[39:30] uh per month but if he had studied the
[39:32] hyperinflation that happened in the
[39:33] United States um in the 19 and the the
[39:36] 18th century he he could have uh put it
[39:40] at 40% you know just that he didn't he
[39:42] didn't study those those period uh by
[39:45] back in 19 he did that in 1956 and
[39:48] there's another guy that studied that
[39:52] more he studied about 30 period of uh
[39:55] moderate ey and hyperinflation per
[39:57] periods it's called Bernards and that's
[40:00] where I learned uh most of what I know
[40:03] about inflation because before that it
[40:05] was a mix of uh like the Kagen books
[40:08] some books I've read about
[40:09] hyperinflation that happened in some
[40:11] countries it was it was a a great
[40:14] empirical you know knowledge that what
[40:16] happened there but I could not if you
[40:18] ask me me a question what is what's the
[40:21] Tipping Point of hyperinflation I could
[40:23] not really explain it to you but when I
[40:25] read read bernold book it was super
[40:27] clear it was just the monetary
[40:30] substitution things and to make it even
[40:33] more clear when the they had
[40:36] hyperinflation in wear okay Germany uh
[40:39] after the first war the first world war
[40:40] sorry there was high inflation or or um
[40:45] well a lot of inflation in France too
[40:47] because France was printing a lot of
[40:49] money too because they suffered the war
[40:51] too so so basically why there was a
[40:55] hyperinflation only in Germany because
[40:57] of monetary substitution because people
[40:59] were were dumping marks for Frank and
[41:03] the Frank was a lot had a lot of
[41:06] inflation too in France and the Frank
[41:08] with a money that would devaluate a lot
[41:11] but just in less compared to the mark
[41:15] and that's why the Mark had
[41:16] hyperinflation because people were just
[41:18] dumping the mark to buy Frank to buy
[41:20] pianos to buy anything they could buy in
[41:23] on the market to uh to save their
[41:26] prision power so and um and and the
[41:29] French people were were doing that a bit
[41:31] less and that's it that's the only
[41:34] explanation on why um uh Germany had
[41:37] hyperinflation back in in
[41:39] 1923 and not France because uh the
[41:43] people from in France were not dumping
[41:46] the currency uh as fast as the German
[41:50] and that's that's the Tipping Point
[41:52] basically for me interesting is that you
[41:56] said that uh not all currencies have to
[41:59] have inflate that that's really
[42:02] interesting for me because I always
[42:04] thought actually that once you have
[42:06] inflation you have to pay the interest
[42:08] in that and there will come emergencies
[42:10] and that's why they they keep inflating
[42:14] and with every time they inflating a
[42:16] little bit next time they have to
[42:18] inflate way more that's like the that's
[42:20] why like this this exponential M2 growth
[42:23] like this this this crazy charts where
[42:25] I'm like okay what is that I want to
[42:26] invest yes that yes but but there's
[42:29] there's no problem with that let's say
[42:31] look at the all the um Latin American
[42:33] countries uh their bills have a lot of
[42:36] zeros I mean if you go to Mexico uh
[42:39] 50,000 pezos bills uh won't buy you
[42:42] anything I don't have the I mean I don't
[42:44] have the the exchange rate in mind but
[42:46] they they they they added zeros in the
[42:49] 70s in the 80s because they had a debt
[42:51] crisis at that time and um the
[42:54] government was able to borrow a lot
[42:56] because of low interest rate or and no
[42:59] no in the 70s and then 80s there was
[43:01] there was high interest there's there's
[43:04] there's something that there those in
[43:06] those days those country were getting
[43:08] more um they were getting more serous or
[43:11] something and and some countries around
[43:13] the world wanted to lend them money
[43:15] something like that that's what I read
[43:18] so they they they accumulate some debts
[43:20] and that they were not able to uh to pay
[43:22] it and that's a Deb crisis that happened
[43:25] there because of that and they print
[43:27] printed money to get out of the the debt
[43:29] spiral so so they fixed the problem by
[43:32] devaluating their money and if you add
[43:34] some zeros and and you don't reach the
[43:37] monetary substitution uh uh switch and
[43:40] and you just devaluate your money and
[43:42] and the people tolerate it well then you
[43:45] can stabilize the inflation after at 2%
[43:48] and you're you're going to be fine all
[43:50] the Latin American countries did the had
[43:53] this same problem and actually the the
[43:56] Mexican p did perform well uh in the
[43:59] last few years compared to the US dollar
[44:02] and I guess it's because they didn't
[44:04] they just didn't print as much as the
[44:06] the the the US dollar the the Americans
[44:09] did so it just means that if you don't
[44:13] print too much money even if you printed
[44:15] a lot of money before you can be fine
[44:18] that's just um basically if you don't
[44:21] Finance your country with money printing
[44:24] you can have fat money for for for
[44:27] eternity it will work but you had just
[44:30] have to keep in mind that a 2% inflation
[44:33] per year for 30 year double your prices
[44:37] so your price will double every 20 30
[44:41] years and that's it at some point you're
[44:43] going to add a zero to to the bills and
[44:46] that's it that that's what happened to
[44:48] the Frank and the new Frank in France
[44:51] they had bills like uh 50 500 Franks and
[44:56] po this they switch they red denominate
[44:59] they called the new Frank they remove
[45:01] some zeros and then one Frank back in
[45:03] the 60s was worth like kind of a lot of
[45:06] money like I don't know maybe I don't
[45:08] know let's say $10 today it's 10 Frank
[45:10] today or maybe 20 Frank
[45:12] today but it was one Frank it was had a
[45:15] Pur purchasing power and and um let's
[45:19] say uh at the end of the Frank era
[45:22] because now it's Euro uh but while the
[45:24] Frank had very lower cing power than in
[45:27] the 60s but it was still some Franks and
[45:30] you would just need 10 Franks to pay for
[45:33] what you were paying one Frank at at at
[45:35] at the time that's it you just add zero
[45:38] very
[45:39] slowly so no so in my view you can keep
[45:43] fat system working as long as the
[45:45] population accepts it accept it that's
[45:49] it for me it sounds like it's a lot
[45:53] about about trust like as as long the
[45:57] population has trust in the currency
[46:00] they can actually print even a lot as as
[46:03] long as the people uh think it it has
[46:07] some value yeah you you may be right but
[46:10] not a lot there's there's a point that
[46:13] it it shows in the economy because
[46:15] because if you had if you flood the
[46:17] economy with money some some economic
[46:19] principle will make the price go up
[46:21] because people will overbid each other
[46:24] so it will but you're right that you can
[46:27] still print some level of of money that
[46:30] I don't know I don't know the exact
[46:32] dipping point oh well actually we print
[46:35] in in um Western countries we print
[46:38] basically six to s% more money per year
[46:40] and we measure 2% inflation but we still
[46:43] had six to s% more money to the system
[46:47] every year and and people are okay with
[46:51] it because they they didn't feel it that
[46:53] much uh in the in the last few years now
[46:56] we're feeling it more so uh and and what
[46:59] I wanted to add basically is that what
[47:02] you're saying about trust is it shows so
[47:05] much with the solution of
[47:09] hyperinflation what I mean is that you
[47:11] can have a um you can create a new
[47:14] currency in a country that is very solid
[47:17] and
[47:18] fail it mean people won't trust it and
[47:21] you can even have a brand new currency
[47:24] that is based on nothing just ideas and
[47:26] and and talk and so just just
[47:30] but if people believe it it will it will
[47:32] fix hyperinflation and inflation just
[47:35] because people are trusting and
[47:37] accepting the money so what I mean is
[47:38] that you can have a perfect solution
[47:40] that doesn't work because people are not
[47:41] trusting it and a shitty solution that
[47:44] works just because people are trusting
[47:45] it so it's just the way uh basically I
[47:48] guess you're you're better to have a
[47:49] good solution that people accept but it
[47:52] just mean that a good solution can not
[47:54] work and a bad solution can work work
[47:57] it's just based on the trust of the
[47:59] people super interesting I mean to the
[48:03] point I think like if if you print a lot
[48:05] you probably lose the trust so that's
[48:08] also also one thing um the thing I
[48:10] wanted to Allure to is
[48:13] like what if this positive Bitcoin mind
[48:18] virus that that got me and hooked and
[48:21] that probably also got you hooked and
[48:22] and some of the listen probably most of
[48:24] the listeners also uh spreads where they
[48:27] they don't trust the Euro anymore
[48:30] they're like 100% outside of of of the
[48:32] Euro what if that spreads in in the
[48:36] whole society and the trust completely
[48:39] gets lost in in in in in the currencies
[48:43] then it's also have inflated or what
[48:45] super easy to explain it's the let's
[48:48] take the example of the monetary uh
[48:50] World on sorry the world Reserve
[48:53] currencies that we had in the last 500
[48:55] years it's started with uh Spain uh with
[48:59] the well actually I have a well let's
[49:01] let's let's begin the artifact showing
[49:04] that's a real uh Spanish dollar
[49:07] basically that's uh that's uh eight real
[49:10] real so it's piece of eight so it's from
[49:13] Spain this one is 18
[49:15] 1814 184 that's a real Spanish so so
[49:19] that's where come that's where the the
[49:21] the US dollar comes from a US dollar is
[49:24] this exact same size that's I'm I'm I'm
[49:26] going to show you it's it's it's super
[49:28] interesting and I'm going to continue
[49:30] about the o reserve currency after but
[49:32] you're going to all know now where the
[49:34] US dollar comes from so that's that's
[49:36] the size of a real US dollar when it got
[49:40] implemented in the 1792 that's a modern
[49:44] one but that's the size of of silver
[49:47] coin that it was at the time let's
[49:49] compare it to the Spanish dollar is the
[49:51] exact same coin you know so the US
[49:53] dollar the the meaning of a dollar is
[49:56] that it's about
[49:58] $25 of well maybe $20 of silver right
[50:01] there so basically now it's just worth a
[50:04] most nothing you know a dollar is not
[50:06] worth much but back in those days a
[50:08] dollar was worth at least $20 of silver
[50:11] basically okay wait wait so hang on for
[50:14] a second I just want to make it for the
[50:17] listeners that don't have the video
[50:20] because they I have the video everywhere
[50:22] where I can get the video to so like
[50:24] Spotify has the video YouTube has the
[50:26] video access the video but for those who
[50:28] maybe listen on Fountain or on on Apple
[50:31] music or something like that uh they can
[50:34] yeah switch over to to Twitter or
[50:36] YouTube or whatever if if they really
[50:38] want to to see the coins because I think
[50:39] it's really interesting uh and I love
[50:42] that that you have the the whole
[50:45] collection here H and I think that's one
[50:48] of the I I usually keep it uh also
[50:50] listener friendly but I think that's one
[50:52] of the rare instances where you might
[50:54] want to switch over to Twitter or you
[50:56] switch over to Spotify or YouTube or
[50:57] somewhere and then actually see see the
[50:59] stuff that's going on so but sorry
[51:00] continue yeah cool so so I'm going to
[51:02] describe it a bit so so those corns are
[51:05] about let's say three 3 cm um um large
[51:10] let's say 1 inch and a half in in
[51:13] diameters uh and yeah they they're
[51:16] they're worth about uh 20 or $25 of
[51:19] silver so that's a real word of original
[51:21] dollar so what I showing right here it's
[51:24] a taller so that's the origin of the
[51:26] World dollar it's it this one is an
[51:28] Austrian one so the Austrian Netherland
[51:32] in
[51:33] 1793 so that's that's the origin of the
[51:36] world dollar it's a toer taller means
[51:39] Valley in uh in German right wa wait
[51:42] wait
[51:44] the uh the word dollar comes from
[51:48] Austria well uh not no not Austria some
[51:52] some some region of uh Germany I think
[51:56] where there there was a mountain full of
[51:58] silver and there's a guy called
[52:01] join uh I think it was called join was
[52:04] uh uh minting those coin and that's one
[52:08] of the um that's one of
[52:11] the well he coined the the world taller
[52:15] the word taller in the size and then a
[52:17] lot of countries used the taller
[52:19] denomination so Austria had their own
[52:23] toer right there so this oh from Tal
[52:27] interesting like there's this German
[52:29] word t or Dar and I I never wow
[52:34] interesting that's that's for me it's
[52:37] really interesting because I'm German
[52:38] speaking uh and there's this word uh t
[52:41] tala uh that is just used as as like as
[52:45] as a coin uh especially like in comics
[52:48] in the early when I was watching the the
[52:51] comics as a kid that this word was
[52:54] really present there uh and this is the
[52:56] origin of dollar yeah just like Google
[52:59] and now it came up that that's pretty
[53:01] wow so so basically this Corin from
[53:05] Austria
[53:06] 1793 that's Austrian Netherlands back in
[53:10] those uh those days I guess it was the
[53:12] uh Habsburg or the uh you know the the
[53:15] the Austrian it was not the Austrian
[53:17] Empire anyway so I guess it was some
[53:19] asberg people that coined the um this
[53:23] this particular taller but there was a
[53:25] lot of toer in of countries in Europe
[53:28] and you have uh the uh Spanish dollar
[53:31] that about the same size uh right across
[53:33] so about like let's say three or four
[53:35] centimeter of diameter and and at the
[53:38] end you have the US dollar right there
[53:41] the original size of a US dollar in
[53:43] silver so that's that's what I wanted to
[53:45] show you so back to the um the world
[53:48] Reserve currencies so we had the uh
[53:51] Spanish Dollar in the when the the the
[53:54] the the Spain was a superpower they went
[53:57] to to Americas they had a lot of power
[54:00] in in Europe and then um the first
[54:03] center Banks was founded in Netherland
[54:06] and Amsterdam so so all the um the world
[54:11] Commerce uh migrated to uh Amsterdam so
[54:15] it became the world Reserve currency
[54:16] it's a it's a golden I have I have it
[54:18] right here I have a golden I have
[54:20] everything basically of uh the history
[54:23] of uh of water Reserve currency so the
[54:27] golden red there it's not a it's not a
[54:30] great piece because I didn't paid that
[54:32] much so basically it's a bit smaller but
[54:35] it was a a silver coin also uh but the
[54:39] the cool thing here is that uh it was
[54:41] not the silver corn that was a reserve
[54:43] currency it was the the scriptural money
[54:46] in the books of the bank of Amsterdam so
[54:49] it was some account accounting money you
[54:51] know on U on ledgers so that's that's
[54:55] that's when uh the switch were made uh
[54:58] between the world Reserve currency from
[54:59] Spain to the Netherland and then uh
[55:02] England and then United States after the
[55:05] first world war so basically what I mean
[55:07] here is you you're seeing so um when
[55:11] people uh don't trust the Euro they they
[55:14] might choose something else well it did
[55:16] happen uh um it did happen uh like at
[55:21] least five times in well four or five
[55:23] times in the 500 years and you know what
[55:26] what's really interesting here is that
[55:29] the Spaniard were not devaluating their
[55:32] um their Spanish dollar they were
[55:34] devaluating the money of the people who
[55:37] was marav that's a mar marav there here
[55:41] right there it's a smaller coin a copper
[55:42] coin and you can't see that on the
[55:45] camera but there's a number stamp on it
[55:48] so basically the government will
[55:49] recalling the corn and stamping new uh
[55:52] denomination on it so it would call all
[55:54] the corn of people and stamp a two on it
[55:57] and then a four and then an eight so
[55:59] they were doubling the monetary Mass
[56:02] like that so at one point I guess that
[56:04] uh that uh well they were doing that
[56:07] because they want to transfer the
[56:08] inflation to the population and not
[56:10] devaluate their world Reserve Currency
[56:13] coin that was used by the world Commerce
[56:16] if they were doing if they they were
[56:18] devaluating their their Spanish dollar
[56:21] they would lose the the the the world
[56:23] Reserve currency status and the reite
[56:26] the money of the people instead so what
[56:29] what is important to understand here is
[56:31] that all those monetary World Reserve
[56:34] currency were uh were not touched by
[56:36] devaluation until the people choose
[56:39] another currency or maybe if they began
[56:41] to devaluated people were choosing
[56:43] another currency because they had the
[56:45] choice and the United States is
[56:48] basically the first superpower to
[56:49] devaluate the world Reserve currency why
[56:52] because they can because they they
[56:54] impose their power they have a n in
[56:56] French and I'm not sure what's in
[56:58] English but I mean they they are the
[57:00] world superpower they can impose their
[57:02] currency for world kers with with oil
[57:05] let's say the Petro dollar is a good
[57:07] example they impose their currency for
[57:09] the trading of oil so that so so people
[57:13] don't have a choice to use their money
[57:15] to to make um contract for oil or um
[57:19] other uh like big big International
[57:22] deals so basically that's why they can
[57:24] devaluate it and don't have the choice
[57:27] anymore for their money before Bitcoin
[57:29] happened basically now people that
[57:32] individual can have choice to to opt out
[57:35] and choose Bitcoin but what I'm what I'm
[57:37] seeing here is before the United States
[57:40] the US dollar was the water Reserve
[57:42] currency people could choose by
[57:45] themselves their own uh currency they
[57:47] want to use uh and that's why uh we had
[57:51] different world Reserve currency in the
[57:54] last 500 years it's really well uh
[57:56] describe on Ray alio book uh changing
[58:00] world order something like that but Ray
[58:03] Delio's book is really really
[58:04] interesting on that subject of uh
[58:06] changing World Reserve currencies yeah I
[58:09] think that's a a must read uh if if
[58:12] people don't want to read he put out
[58:14] also really good video like I think a 45
[58:16] minutes or 50 minute video on YouTube
[58:19] which is really good and I think after
[58:22] you saw that video on YouTube you
[58:24] probably want to buy the book and and
[58:25] and see was going on uh it's one of
[58:28] those books that's not a Bitcoin book
[58:29] but I think still really valuable uh to
[58:32] read and and and and dive into that's
[58:35] super interesting um I wow I I also saw
[58:40] a little bit more about the tala thing
[58:42] uh it's now in Czech a place it was the
[58:44] yahim tala and uh it's it's now a place
[58:49] in in Czech Republic it's actually not
[58:51] that far away from from Prague okay it's
[58:53] not in Germany sorry it was a m in Czech
[58:57] it was in Germany uh but now it's no no
[59:00] longer in Germany okay okay that's why
[59:04] so that was that is super interesting so
[59:06] like the the origin is is is German uh
[59:10] but yeah I was yeah maybe I'm a little
[59:12] bit too fascinated by that because I was
[59:15] like dollar yeah it's a US dollar it
[59:17] comes from America like that's an an
[59:19] American thing the word dollar is from
[59:21] Spain I mean the Spanish dollar was
[59:23] there before the US dollar and it was
[59:25] actually that the Spanish dollar was was
[59:27] real basically it was eight real real I
[59:31] guess in English uh but I don't know I
[59:33] don't know specifically why we call it
[59:36] Spanish dollar some sometime it changed
[59:38] it's called the dollar and and their
[59:40] Americans uh use that that same word
[59:42] because basically the Spanish dollar was
[59:44] the money of the US the well the
[59:46] American continent uh before they could
[59:50] mint their own money in 1792 so in 1792
[59:54] they passed the law that uh uh created
[59:57] the US dollar they were able to Mint
[59:59] their own coins but before that they
[60:01] were basically using the Spanish
[60:03] dollars now the Le next logical step for
[60:07] us to discuss is when uh America and the
[60:10] big Nations will adopt Bitcoin as a
[60:13] world Reserve Bitcoin what how does it
[60:17] uh the politician in the US call it
[60:19] strategic Reserve asset I think it's the
[60:21] word they call it um do you foresee that
[60:24] is that is that the first step to
[60:27] bitcoin being an actual World Reserve
[60:29] asset uh underlying of feat I I think
[60:33] it's it with Bitcoin the difference is
[60:35] that it starts with the individuals
[60:38] that's that's the big thing here um I
[60:41] think people will choose by themselves
[60:43] well the people that are aware all those
[60:45] facts that we just
[60:47] stated sorry they will
[60:50] choose uh Bitcoin they have an exit now
[60:53] that didn't really exist uh in Fiat era
[60:57] basically you were tied to your bank
[60:59] account and in your local money you
[61:02] could buy foreign money maybe can can
[61:05] Forex you can can trade some Forex but
[61:08] if even if you use the more the safer
[61:10] one let's say the US dollar uh well you
[61:13] would get devaluated by six to seven per
[61:15] per year anyway so so that's why people
[61:17] invest and that's why people invest in
[61:20] uh houses and and uh and um sorry real
[61:24] estate market that's just just to
[61:26] protect themsel well why houses are so
[61:30] expensive in Canada because people use
[61:33] uh houses has a way to protect
[61:36] themselves from from inflation so that's
[61:38] what people used before they had a new
[61:41] Choice like like like Bitcoin and it's
[61:43] bit I mean right now Bitcoin I don't
[61:45] think it's for everyone because you have
[61:47] to understand it you have to have some
[61:49] technical knowledge it's a bit
[61:51] challenging for for some people to to uh
[61:53] self host well self uh have their their
[61:56] coin on their own wallet with with their
[61:58] own keys I get that um but to any people
[62:02] that understand inflation understand the
[62:04] history of money and understand well are
[62:07] are Tech savy enough to uh to have their
[62:11] own uh custody of of Bitcoin that's the
[62:14] perfect answer for in my in my head so
[62:17] that that that will start with the inv
[62:20] individual for sure then the countries
[62:22] well any country that is dollar
[62:26] the choice is easy I mean you're already
[62:29] using a foreign currency that you don't
[62:31] control the the volume uh in let's say
[62:34] it's it's a good idea for for a small
[62:36] country to use US dollar uh to prevent
[62:39] inflation that's a great idea but the
[62:41] problem is the that they get devaluated
[62:43] six or s% per year and they don't get
[62:46] the free money you know in the United
[62:48] States people get Deval their saving are
[62:50] are devalued but at least they get the
[62:53] money printing you know so there's it's
[62:55] a deal
[62:56] okay your saving is devalued but you get
[62:58] new money for for basically for free so
[63:02] that's not a that's not a good deal but
[63:04] that's not a bad deal the better deal is
[63:06] that is if you get devaluated not get
[63:08] the fresh money so that's that's the
[63:10] choice of the countries that did that
[63:12] get uh that use um US dollar instead of
[63:16] their own fiat currency uh so I guess
[63:19] that those country could easily more
[63:21] easily have a strategic Reserve in
[63:23] Bitcoin to protect them from inflation
[63:26] so that's the second level I guess that
[63:28] those country it's a no-brainer they
[63:30] should they should acquire Bitcoins and
[63:31] there are some country we saw Bon we saw
[63:33] El Salvador U so and there's I guess
[63:37] there's some other country that do that
[63:38] but maybe they don't talk about it um
[63:41] and and also they can mine basically any
[63:44] country could mine with excess energy
[63:46] and have Bitcoins and it would not cost
[63:49] anything to the population or the
[63:51] country right I mean if you have some
[63:53] energy um uh m energy plant that uh is
[63:58] not fully used that and that's the case
[64:00] I mean plants are planned for Peak uh
[64:04] periods so so there's a lot of time
[64:07] during the day that they are not um at
[64:10] Peak so at Peak um um they produce but
[64:14] the the the the grid doesn't um uh
[64:17] doesn't accept all the um the energy so
[64:19] they could mine and have a strategic
[64:21] Reserve at that and the last Point here
[64:24] is the country with monetary
[64:26] um with a monetary sovereignty I guess
[64:29] they will be the last countries to uh to
[64:32] adopt Bitcoin why because those country
[64:35] have a lot of um social programs because
[64:39] they have they are 90 States basically
[64:41] and the only one of the reason they are
[64:43] 9 States is because they can print money
[64:45] in their own uh they can leverage debt
[64:48] in their own currency so basically they
[64:50] have some free money so they can say yes
[64:53] to any demand from the the population
[64:57] and say oh yeah we're going to be in 90
[64:58] States and pay for everything and and
[65:01] and they print money basically to pay
[65:04] all that so they won't let that
[65:06] privilege go easily because well I have
[65:10] a perfect example for you Venezuela
[65:13] that's exactly what happened in
[65:14] Venezuela so the idea of of what
[65:17] happened in Venezuela is super simple so
[65:20] there was there was some company all
[65:22] companies that was keeping all the
[65:24] profit for them because they were
[65:25] private companies and I'm not sure it's
[65:29] Chavez I guess so now there's Madero and
[65:32] before was Chavez so Chavez says that
[65:34] saw that and say that's not fair they're
[65:36] keeping all the profit for themselves
[65:39] for the um for for for the owners that's
[65:42] bad we're going to nationalize that and
[65:44] keep the profit for us and and finance
[65:47] the our social program okay good they
[65:49] did that and it worked they had uh um a
[65:53] lot of uh Improvement in education
[65:56] they they got they had great well not an
[65:59] expert at that but I I know that it was
[66:01] working they had social program all that
[66:04] it was working and then the price of all
[66:06] went down and basically their also their
[66:09] their the nationalized companies were
[66:12] not doing a great job as producing more
[66:15] oil because they wen't investing enough
[66:17] in um in repairing their in their their
[66:21] plants and all that so there was some
[66:23] problem uh of production so less
[66:26] production and price of oil going down
[66:29] they were not making uh enough money
[66:32] well they were not making uh as much
[66:35] money as they were so uh the programs
[66:38] all the social program were still there
[66:40] they needed that much money to run but
[66:42] their revenue were going down and you
[66:45] cannot adjust that if it's a private uh
[66:47] company they can just lay off people and
[66:49] you know
[66:51] uh you you you C you you make your cost
[66:55] go down and you can be safe but not
[66:57] social program you cannot just you
[67:00] cannot just erase them they exist and
[67:02] you know people that work for the states
[67:04] they they work there for the whole life
[67:06] you cannot you cannot you cannot cut
[67:08] their their job so basically what they
[67:11] end up to do is printing money to
[67:13] finance the the social program they
[67:14] created with the money from the orl and
[67:17] that's it after when when they they were
[67:20] not able to produce enough oil and
[67:22] profit to finance it they just finan it
[67:24] with money print thing and they ended up
[67:27] with hyperinflation so that's it that's
[67:29] what happened in it's as simple as that
[67:31] what happened in
[67:32] Venezuela it's it's super fascinating to
[67:35] to to listen to this we we already over
[67:38] at one hour Market it's fascinating how
[67:40] how quick we went there not many
[67:42] questions I still have um but we will
[67:44] definitely do a second round on that I
[67:46] think um for for that episode uh it's
[67:50] it's great that we have like a beginning
[67:53] understanding of like what inflation is
[67:55] how looked some artifacts with that some
[67:57] historical things I I I I really learned
[67:59] a lot uh the day that I have to process
[68:03] and and and get into um now one question
[68:08] that every one of my guests gets um with
[68:11] a different topic what can we learn from
[68:14] you now besides Bitcoin and all those
[68:17] hyperinflation things what what else
[68:20] could we learn uh from
[68:22] you uh well I I study a lot of um the
[68:26] history of money uh I've read about I
[68:29] maybe 30 30 40 books uh well I think
[68:33] I've read close to 100 books in the last
[68:36] four or five years when I discovered
[68:38] Bitcoin it it made me like you know
[68:40] reading fan frenzy or something I I I
[68:43] just wanted to know more about economics
[68:45] history of money inflation
[68:46] hyperinflation so I have some a lot of
[68:49] notes I
[68:50] have 60,000 words of notes like 150
[68:54] pages of note uh that I've I've I've
[68:58] took from every book I've read about
[69:00] money economy and I've made them in
[69:03] order and maybe someday we'll write a
[69:05] book about the history of money to
[69:07] compare um basically the origin the the
[69:11] two different um theor uh Theory
[69:15] theories about the origin of money and
[69:18] that's what that's what I want to bring
[69:20] to the debate here because there's two
[69:22] there's two uh sides um here you have
[69:25] the people of the mmt no monetary uh
[69:28] modern monetary theory that say that
[69:30] money has always been credit so money is
[69:33] a it's a government thing it's like it's
[69:35] a it's it has to be owned by the
[69:38] government and it should be a monopoly
[69:41] and the government should be able to
[69:43] create any money that it needs to uh
[69:45] assess the needs of the population
[69:47] that's their point and the reason behind
[69:49] that is said that money has always been
[69:52] credit and the other side is the the the
[69:56] sorry the um people who think that money
[69:58] is a like go sorry it's a Maris in
[70:02] French I'm sorry commodity sorry the
[70:04] commodity money theary uh that that that
[70:07] will say that anything that is not goal
[70:09] is credit they're kind of right but uh I
[70:13] I don't agree because I think credit is
[70:15] money too because we use credit as money
[70:18] we it's as a semantic thing for me
[70:20] credit can be money uh not all money is
[70:23] credit but credit can be money so you
[70:25] have those two things there and I tried
[70:28] to um to to make one unified uh theory
[70:33] of that and Lin Alden in his book broken
[70:36] money did that uh better than me I guess
[70:39] because I I worked on that uh about a
[70:41] year or two before she published her
[70:44] book and our conclusion are similar uh
[70:46] she says that basically money is just a
[70:48] ledger and that's how you can uh un
[70:51] unify those two theories but my
[70:55] ification process U use the um the
[71:00] monetary premium so what I'm basically
[71:03] Mater is that gold is not worth is not
[71:06] good money because there's an intrinsic
[71:08] value or something it's just because
[71:10] people trust that they're going to be
[71:12] able to exchange it later at a
[71:14] comparable price same with paper money
[71:16] you know it's just that people trust
[71:18] that they will be able to exchange it
[71:20] later at a comparable price and the
[71:22] difference between the value of the
[71:23] paper and the value of the the value in
[71:26] the industry of gold let's say like 10%
[71:29] of its value say it's $3,000 per ounce
[71:32] maybe $300 per ounce is is is real use
[71:35] in Industry well the difference is just
[71:38] monetary premium it's just that people
[71:40] think that goal is worth $3,000 per
[71:44] ounce because it's money and it's the
[71:46] same thing for paper money people think
[71:48] $100 bills worth $100 because they know
[71:51] they can exchange it later for $100
[71:54] worth of goods Goods that's it that both
[71:56] are exactly the same for me it's just
[71:58] that gold have little little intrinsic
[72:01] value or utility value from the industry
[72:04] and that's it there's no way a rock is
[72:07] worth $3,000 per ounce the only reason
[72:10] it's worth that it's because it's rare
[72:13] and people know they will be able to
[72:14] exchange it for a comparable value later
[72:17] so for me both type of money Fiat or
[72:20] gold is based on trust that you can
[72:22] exchange a lader I call that well it's
[72:23] not my term but during my research I
[72:26] Came Upon the term monetary premium and
[72:29] that's how I explained uh the
[72:31] similarities between uh commodity money
[72:33] and credit money so yeah so basically I
[72:36] I just answered your question uh with
[72:38] the whole point that that's what I'm
[72:40] working right now uh on a paper uh to
[72:43] unify those two theories I think and
[72:46] that would be also great maybe I don't
[72:48] know when when this paper book will be
[72:51] finished like in half a year year two
[72:52] years or whatever I think that would be
[72:54] also then a great point to have a second
[72:56] round with you and go deep into some
[72:57] topics because I think it's it's really
[73:00] interesting uh and I like the way how
[73:02] how you look at things not like black
[73:04] and white but really like uh looking at
[73:07] things with a just a logical human mind
[73:10] which sometimes is missed in in ignoring
[73:12] theories I feel like I love that feel a
[73:15] lot thank you I appreciate that perfect
[73:17] then yeah uh we have an end in the
[73:19] podcast where the previous guest is
[73:20] asking a question for the next guest
[73:22] without knowing who the next guest
[73:23] actually is and the last guest was big
[73:25] mstr guy micro strategy and he asked
[73:28] will micro strategy be a trillion doll
[73:32] company uh the answer is
[73:36] yes yes of course of course is is micell
[73:40] will be the first trillionaire I guess I
[73:42] guess so guess oh yeah it's a hard race
[73:45] IL mask and Michael saor I mean ilk has
[73:49] to uh discover Bitcoin also then maybe
[73:51] he he he gets there first yep yep big
[73:55] competition there big competition yeah
[73:58] uh really cool perfect and before I let
[74:00] you go where can people find you ask
