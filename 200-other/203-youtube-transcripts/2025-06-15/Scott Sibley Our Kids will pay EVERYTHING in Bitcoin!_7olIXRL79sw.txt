[00:00] if we do nothing else but have a child
[00:01] become comfortable with with the concept
[00:03] of Bitcoin because they've seen our
[00:05] characters somewhere then we've done our
[00:06] job Bitcoin will become at some points
[00:08] the money that we all use the biggest
[00:10] mind shift that Bitcoin can provide
[00:12] families is that time aspect before I
[00:14] got into Bitcoin I was actually planning
[00:16] to have my first investment property and
[00:18] then Bitcoin came along and luckily
[00:20] saved me from that headache as the
[00:22] Bitcoin Community continues to grow
[00:23] there's so many awesome bitcoiners out
[00:25] there
[00:30] it's so important to get into education
[00:33] and especially educating the very young
[00:35] ones like those people that only lived
[00:38] in a Bitcoin world like if if you be
[00:40] talking about like 12 year old or 5y old
[00:43] or 10 year old people or kids um they
[00:46] they never lived in a world without
[00:48] Bitcoin so why is it really important to
[00:50] like educate uh young kids and young
[00:54] adults uh under 15 Under 12 about
[00:57] Bitcoin and why is this your passion
[01:00] yeah so uh I guess I'll take the tail
[01:01] Eng your question first so it's a
[01:02] passion of my wife and I so both of us
[01:05] are the the team behind Shamy and it's
[01:07] our passion because we we now have two
[01:09] daughters who are both young so our
[01:11] oldest is five and our youngest is only
[01:13] six months um but when we launched
[01:16] shamer our older daughter was um in the
[01:20] womb still so she was my wife was
[01:22] pregnant U we had started learning about
[01:24] Bitcoin back in 2017 2018 and um to your
[01:28] question you know we saw the future um
[01:31] and the need to one day educate her and
[01:34] any future children that we had and so
[01:37] uh we we kind of looked around and
[01:38] realized there really wasn't much of
[01:40] anything out there you know this is
[01:41] going back five six years ago now so you
[01:43] can imagine how different it was and so
[01:46] we decided you know okay let's let's see
[01:47] what we can do on our own um and so that
[01:49] was that was the the why behind we do
[01:52] what everything we do it's our it's our
[01:54] kids and then um you know as we've grown
[01:57] we've realized you know so many
[01:58] bitcoiners in the space
[02:00] are of similar ages you know we're all
[02:02] in the 20 you say 20s to 40s is a big
[02:05] group of us so you're in that kind of
[02:06] prime
[02:08] marriage uh building your family um
[02:10] focus and so you know we've been able to
[02:14] kind of create a community if you will
[02:16] of people who are like-minded not only
[02:18] about Bitcoin but about wanting to raise
[02:20] their families um and teach their kids
[02:23] from an early age about not just Bitcoin
[02:25] but really you know Financial education
[02:27] Independence um understanding money and
[02:30] you know where it all comes from so
[02:31] that's the the long version of of the
[02:34] why behind what we do ah interesting
[02:37] really I think it's so important to have
[02:40] a big why um where's this name coming
[02:42] from Shamir sh shammer yeah so the name
[02:46] comes from so our first product was um
[02:48] was our game so holding it up here for
[02:50] those that are watching um and so our
[02:53] game is a memory game um for kids um age
[02:57] four through adults um we actually have
[02:58] drinking game instructions on the
[03:00] website for those adults that are
[03:01] interested but uh the name comes from
[03:03] the fact that it's played similar to the
[03:05] game of memory that probably many kids
[03:08] and adults played as as kids where
[03:09] you're flipping over cards trying to
[03:11] remember where the different objects
[03:13] were to make matches um so that's that's
[03:15] where the Bay game is based off of but
[03:17] it teaches about Bitcoin mining and so
[03:20] the the name shaaray so sha is coming
[03:22] from Sha 256 um the algorithm that's
[03:26] used in the mining process and then uh
[03:28] Mory comes from the back half of the
[03:30] name Memory so we we mashed those two
[03:32] words together um and created shammer so
[03:35] yeah that that's where the uh the name
[03:37] originated from and um kind of is stuck
[03:39] people like it kind of fun and unique
[03:41] and has a nice story with it nice it's
[03:44] it's interesting how do you get uh like
[03:47] the education across it's like a memory
[03:49] game where you have to put two things
[03:51] together and and they they you will
[03:53] learn something with that all yeah so
[03:55] there's um obviously better with visuals
[03:57] but essentially there's um two main deck
[04:00] sets of cards the targets and the nons
[04:03] and so the goal of the game just like in
[04:05] mining is for you know the computers are
[04:06] out there they're trying to to come up
[04:08] with the correct kns to Hash to then uh
[04:12] match that Target and mine the next
[04:13] block so in our game there's a stack of
[04:17] cards that are the uh Target cards you
[04:20] flip over one of them and there's
[04:21] characters on all of them once again for
[04:23] those who are actually I'll just show
[04:24] the book so on the top here you can see
[04:26] we we use monster characters for
[04:27] everything we do and that's kind of what
[04:29] we're we're known for there's one on my
[04:30] shirt here so every card has a character
[04:32] on it you find that first Target you
[04:34] want to flip over a matching nons
[04:37] eventually that happens creates the
[04:38] first block so you're mining a
[04:40] blockchain with the cards um as a group
[04:43] of two or more players but there's a
[04:45] dice that's used as well that can cause
[04:47] your chain to start to get attacked if
[04:49] the tack chain ever grows longer than
[04:50] the blockchain 51% attack gamees over
[04:53] for everybody um so it's showing how
[04:55] mining is it's competitive you know
[04:57] we're all trying to mine and earn those
[04:58] rewards but it's also collaborative in
[05:00] the sense that we're all trying to
[05:01] protect that same chain so from a um not
[05:04] only a Bitcoin perspective but something
[05:05] we hear from families and parents is you
[05:08] know the fact that all my kids you know
[05:10] they're trying to get the most rewards
[05:11] to ultimately win the game but then if
[05:14] they ever play a game where the chain
[05:15] gets attacked and everybody loses they
[05:17] realize that we're all in this together
[05:19] so you can take a very competitive child
[05:21] who then has to realize you know I need
[05:23] to sometimes we need to help the other
[05:24] players through this process to be able
[05:26] to make sure that the chain ultimately
[05:28] gets uh gets M to to a height of 10 in
[05:30] the in our game so it's teaching not
[05:32] only about Bitcoin but about
[05:34] collaboration um and kind of that
[05:35] dynamic as
[05:37] well that that's that's
[05:40] beautiful like when you have the the
[05:43] concept of like there's someone winning
[05:45] because I don't like the games where
[05:47] everyone wins or like you that that kind
[05:50] of a concept but it's nice to have both
[05:52] Concepts and there where like you have
[05:54] to do something together but also
[05:56] there's like a winner uh type thing so
[05:59] like that's that's that's really
[06:00] interesting how how did your how was
[06:03] your experience with gamifying learning
[06:05] like basically that's that's that's what
[06:07] you do like you have really nice games
[06:09] but you learn some with with that I mean
[06:11] maybe it's more on the game side than on
[06:13] the learning side like if there's like a
[06:15] balance between game and learn it's it's
[06:17] a little bit more on the game side uh
[06:19] but how did you experience with that
[06:21] yeah so um before before doing any of
[06:24] this neither my wife and I had any
[06:26] experience creating games or doing or
[06:28] writing books you know with three books
[06:30] now are manufacturing so everything's
[06:32] been a learning process but um you know
[06:35] gamifying learning U wasn't easy
[06:38] especially for this game there were it
[06:40] was probably about a year process um
[06:42] that it took us to be able to ultimately
[06:44] come out with what is now the game um
[06:47] and the early um versions of it were
[06:50] were not good they weren't fun um they
[06:52] were overly complex um you know for for
[06:55] being able to play the games especially
[06:57] for children so uh like I said
[06:59] everything we do is using these
[07:01] characters that we've created and um
[07:04] before creating the characters we're
[07:06] just trying to use information on the
[07:07] cards so no really fun visuals and real
[07:10] realize not only is that not as fun but
[07:12] it's a lot harder to create matching
[07:14] pairs from a mental perspective to
[07:16] remember those sorts of things so we
[07:18] wanted to create these images that
[07:19] people would remember and so it was a
[07:21] whole learning process having um family
[07:24] and friends you know test the game out
[07:26] and play with us being subjected to uh
[07:28] some some boring times painstaking games
[07:31] just to work through that stuff but you
[07:33] know what came out at the end is
[07:35] something we're we're proud of um you
[07:37] know not only the game we have the
[07:38] single game and then building everything
[07:40] around these character sets one thing
[07:42] that um mallerie and I have always said
[07:44] is you know if we do nothing else but
[07:46] have people remember um have a child
[07:50] become comfortable with with the concept
[07:51] of Bitcoin because they've seen our
[07:53] characters somewhere then we've done our
[07:55] job because that Comfort level is going
[07:57] to them let them know that you know coin
[07:59] isn't something scary or complex or um
[08:04] only for adults you know it's just a
[08:05] thing that's out there and it's going to
[08:07] be common place for them and so if our
[08:08] if our characters can do that um then
[08:11] that that's the battle that we're trying
[08:13] to to win what do you think does the
[08:16] that to a generation that lives in
[08:19] Bitcoin from such a young age gets to
[08:21] know about Bitcoin from such a long age
[08:24] like I just imagine like there's like a
[08:26] kid of a Bitcoin right now who's like
[08:28] maybe I don't know years old uh and he
[08:31] she has like this this games maybe she
[08:34] also has like a little bit of a wallet
[08:37] where a lightning wallet where she gets
[08:38] some some pocket money that she can
[08:40] exchange with maybe another friend that
[08:42] also has a lightning wallet they like
[08:44] get get to know about Bitcoin and about
[08:48] the the things so early on like a little
[08:50] bit like the kids with with with phones
[08:53] are like way better than than someone
[08:56] that is like 70 years old uh because
[08:58] they have it from from the the onwards
[09:01] on like how do you imagine a generation
[09:04] from like they are now 10 years old and
[09:07] they they live through that how
[09:08] different can that be for for the world
[09:11] yeah and the nice thing is um for our
[09:13] personal happen stance you know we don't
[09:15] really even need to imagine it because
[09:16] we see it in our daughter our older
[09:18] daughter so she's she's five now um many
[09:22] some people out there listening might
[09:23] have met her because um a year ago when
[09:25] she was three actually U we started
[09:27] taking her to to conferences when we
[09:29] have booths um so she's there and part
[09:32] of what we did um to help bring her into
[09:35] um the fun of the conference the booth
[09:38] um learn how to to sell uh that
[09:40] atmosphere is she wanted to create a
[09:42] product of her own and so she created um
[09:46] lot first she only had bracelets so she
[09:48] she made beaded bracelets um and she had
[09:51] a bowl of them there at um in Miami at
[09:53] the Bitcoin conference 2023 and then um
[09:57] had her set up there with a um a little
[09:59] and a QR code that went to her personal
[10:01] lightning wallet um and people could
[10:04] come over and it was all donation based
[10:05] so there wasn't a price on them U but
[10:07] she was literally standing at our our
[10:10] booth for three days straight you know
[10:12] eight to 10 hours um asking people if
[10:14] they want to buy buy her bracelets U
[10:17] many people said yes many people said no
[10:19] which is also a learning experience but
[10:21] to your point she was they'd say you
[10:23] know how do I pay and she would say oh
[10:25] you know here this is my lightning
[10:27] wallet um here's you know scan this QR
[10:29] code and and you in a way you go so her
[10:32] being then three um you know got
[10:35] comfortable with taking payment in
[10:37] Bitcoin like it was nothing else um she
[10:41] knows now you know this is now a year
[10:43] later she's been to um I believe four
[10:45] conferences since we we just got back
[10:47] from Nashville a couple weeks ago um and
[10:49] and both kids were there with us and and
[10:51] Charlotte was there selling bracelets
[10:53] keychains and necklaces now so she's
[10:54] expanded her product line um but she's
[10:57] able to to accept payment she doesn't
[10:59] think anything of it um she thinks of
[11:02] Bitcoin as just another form of money
[11:05] like anything else um she knows enough
[11:08] that if you ask her you know she'll say
[11:10] you know you want to spend your dollars
[11:12] not your Bitcoin because Bitcoin goes up
[11:13] and dollars go down so she understands
[11:15] the concept of of Hing and and and that
[11:18] sort of stuff at a very minimal basis um
[11:21] and so seeing seeing it through her eyes
[11:24] lets us know that it's just going to be
[11:26] second nature to all these kids to your
[11:28] point you know picking up an iPhone um
[11:31] an iPad turning on TVs going through
[11:33] apps you know it's all it's all the same
[11:34] concept um and so being able to live it
[11:38] every day with her and then down the
[11:39] line with her s when her sister gets
[11:41] older um I think we're all in in good
[11:43] hands um and really it's the adults um
[11:46] as we all know that are that are harder
[11:48] to teach and to to change the mindset
[11:50] of is that um do you think like that's
[11:53] always this question in my mind and I
[11:54] asked that like since the first episode
[11:56] basically I did not come up with an nice
[11:58] answer to that
[12:00] um if if we have Bitcoin and for me it's
[12:02] like abundantly clear that Bitcoin will
[12:05] become at some point the the money that
[12:07] we all use it's just a question of like
[12:09] is it five years or 500 years like
[12:12] that's a the time variant is like really
[12:14] hard to predict but I think there's no
[12:16] question about like that it happens at
[12:17] some point um for me at
[12:21] least and and the question that I ask
[12:24] myself so much is like what will that
[12:26] change like is is is changing the
[12:29] fundamental uh layer of money is the
[12:32] changing the the unit of account that we
[12:35] exchange value with is is just
[12:37] exchanging that exchanging something in
[12:40] in the human brain is that changing the
[12:42] the the world
[12:43] fundamentally or is it just money in the
[12:46] end of the day and humans are still
[12:47] humans and humans will uh still steal
[12:50] humans will still do do bad things and
[12:52] good things and it does not do a lot do
[12:55] you have some some answers or some
[12:57] insights as as you have a lot of context
[12:59] also with like new generation that gets
[13:02] in Bitcoin yeah I think uh obviously
[13:06] like you said who knows what will
[13:07] actually happen I guess I could answer
[13:08] it from what I would hope happens and
[13:12] the biggest part of that hope is that um
[13:15] families um such as ours or any other
[13:17] ones that are able to um adopt the
[13:20] Bitcoin side of things and see the the
[13:22] long-term value and doing so are able to
[13:24] recoup the the time that they're able to
[13:27] spend together and enjoy each other and
[13:30] go on vacations and um have less stress
[13:34] around the financial aspects of life and
[13:37] um live more free and so that's that's
[13:40] part of the benefit that you know we we
[13:42] are able to see in um in the future and
[13:45] so how long that takes for for that to
[13:48] shift from just kind of the um the
[13:51] hardcore set of bitcoiners like like you
[13:53] and I and maybe you others out there
[13:55] into the vast population I don't know
[13:57] but to me the hopefully the big
[14:00] mind shift um that Bitcoin can provide
[14:03] families is that time aspect because I
[14:05] think so much of it is has been taken
[14:07] away um from past Generations you know
[14:12] both both parents having to work or um
[14:15] you know really you're sending your kid
[14:17] off for eight six8 10 hours a day um
[14:20] coming home eating dinner going to bed
[14:23] doing the same thing over again five
[14:24] days a week and then on the weekends
[14:26] you're exhausted from those five days a
[14:28] week and you maybe you're catching up on
[14:30] going grocery shopping or cleaning or
[14:32] whatever it is but if there's a better
[14:34] balance that can be brought to life for
[14:36] for families um that would be the the
[14:39] most beneficial and beautiful thing that
[14:41] that could come out of all this in in my
[14:43] mind and I think it will come because I
[14:46] think uh we get more efficient in in in
[14:49] doing things so we will get more
[14:51] efficient in providing the base layer of
[14:55] of Life way more um effectively and easy
[14:59] eily uh with robotics with AI with all
[15:01] the things that we are developing uh
[15:04] which hopefully gives humans more time
[15:07] to uh focus on the most significant and
[15:12] most pressing things that we actually
[15:14] have to focus on like getting to maybe
[15:17] other planets if if that's something
[15:18] that we want to pursue uh and and do do
[15:21] the things that uh we are passionate
[15:23] about and not the things
[15:25] that keeps the Bills running like that's
[15:28] that's I think that's a really sad life
[15:31] at some point if you do that too long
[15:32] obviously there are seasons to life and
[15:34] at some point you have to hustle and and
[15:36] and get the builds done but uh it should
[15:38] not be like a a a main thing why did you
[15:42] actually um get Bitcoin in the first
[15:44] place like how did you get get into and
[15:46] and why what what made it click that's
[15:48] always interesting for me to know yeah
[15:50] um my story is uh my rabbit whole story
[15:54] is very similar to so many other people
[15:55] in that kind of 2017 2018 range where
[15:59] um you know late 2017 I I think just saw
[16:02] internet chatter about you know bitcoin
[16:04] price going up and then obviously
[16:06] altcoins and all that stuff that came
[16:08] about and so um started becoming
[16:11] interesting interested then um went down
[16:14] the typical um cycle of buying the
[16:17] shitcoins and then um studying and
[16:20] luckily in my case um it was only you
[16:23] know two or three months before
[16:24] realizing that everything else could be
[16:27] ignored um focused on theit coin so um
[16:30] grateful for that and I think part of
[16:32] the reason it was able to click um
[16:35] quicker for me is um of my background so
[16:39] um before all this after going to
[16:42] college I was um in accounting um so I
[16:45] kind of have a a numbers um Financial
[16:48] background um for a few years and then
[16:51] after that I actually transitioned to a
[16:53] job that was in the um education
[16:56] technology space helping to create um
[16:59] products um in various roles from
[17:01] product creation to marketing to um
[17:04] sales and so my background is a mixture
[17:07] of numbers um and understanding ledgers
[17:11] and the importance of
[17:12] verifiability um mixed with creativity
[17:16] and um understanding the value in um
[17:19] technology and so I think the the
[17:22] background of those two things sinking
[17:24] together um I've also always from a
[17:27] young age been prone to be a more of a
[17:29] saver than a spender um so understanding
[17:32] the value of you know saving and
[17:34] compounding and that sort of stuff so it
[17:37] was just kind of The Perfect Storm um
[17:39] where once I started reading and
[17:41] learning and um listening uh to things
[17:44] about Bitcoin that it was pretty quick
[17:46] for me to to start understanding and
[17:48] luckily um you know at the time I'd been
[17:50] married for a few years with mallerie
[17:51] and well it wasn't really until we
[17:54] started creating shamur that she had a
[17:55] full interest in it she was very
[17:57] supportive of the interest I had prior
[17:59] to that um and being able to to
[18:02] financially start going down that Rabbit
[18:04] Hill together as well so that's kind of
[18:06] the the journey that I took interesting
[18:09] and it's for me it's always interesting
[18:12] uh what's the most important for uh for
[18:14] people in Bitcoin uh like what what what
[18:17] is it for you like uh some say like oh
[18:19] it's like that we we have to have like
[18:21] the store value or some like the fact
[18:23] that you can just like uh have the
[18:25] payments across borders because they
[18:27] like to move a lot around and then fear
[18:29] this so pain in the ass when you try to
[18:31] move money around so like what's for you
[18:34] like the the most important thing that
[18:37] that Bitcoin
[18:39] does yeah I think like you said it's a
[18:41] you're always GNA get different answers
[18:43] from different people on that especially
[18:45] depending on where they're based in the
[18:46] world and their their life circumstances
[18:49] around you know money you know being
[18:52] Lucky in this case growing up in in
[18:54] America um in a um in a place where
[18:59] you as a kid you don't have to worry you
[19:01] know about your money being devalued in
[19:03] your face overnight obviously we all
[19:05] know it's happening behind the scenes um
[19:08] I think the most important thing on our
[19:10] side of for us particularly is kind of
[19:13] make you know that that store of value
[19:15] um making sure that you know the hard
[19:17] cap of 21 million you know that in my
[19:20] mind is where it all starts and then
[19:21] everything else kind of bleeds out from
[19:23] there from importance but um number one
[19:26] for for me would be the the 21 million
[19:28] ion and the hard cap and um
[19:31] understanding the importance of why
[19:34] things with scarcity have have value um
[19:37] and I think from you know growing up you
[19:40] always hear about you know real estate
[19:41] having scarcity and um having you know
[19:44] we live in San Diego which is definitely
[19:47] on the higher end of prices for Real
[19:49] Estate from a young age so I always saw
[19:52] how things with scarcity even though you
[19:54] can always create more houses there's
[19:56] limited space here in our city so I
[19:58] think that's also what played a role
[20:00] into understanding scarcity where I saw
[20:02] I visually saw how people in the real
[20:04] estate market were able to make money
[20:06] from a scarce supply of things that
[20:08] people wanted in a um and so being able
[20:10] to transer that over into a digital
[20:12] Supply where it's actually true scarcity
[20:15] true verifiability um and all the other
[20:18] good things that come along with it um
[20:20] plays a role in my answer as
[20:22] well yeah why did you not go then to to
[20:26] real estate like if uh you saw that is
[20:29] was there like a decision where you made
[20:30] like consciously now I don't want real
[20:32] estate because of that uh I think well
[20:37] probably because from you know a young
[20:39] age when you just have the money to do
[20:41] it you know being it's a much
[20:43] more higher threshold to be able to to
[20:46] go down that route you know when you're
[20:48] obviously when you're a teenager that's
[20:49] impossible but coming out of college you
[20:51] know you need to to focus on other
[20:53] things to be able to to make 's meet and
[20:55] so the nice thing about Bitcoin is you
[20:57] know you could have a dollar and you can
[20:59] start your journey you can have less
[21:00] than a dollar doesn't you know doesn't
[21:02] really matter and so that low stakes of
[21:04] Entry um is is very important for people
[21:07] no matter where they are in the world
[21:08] interesting yeah yeah because I before I
[21:10] got uh into Bitcoin I was actually
[21:13] planning or like even talking to Banks
[21:15] and stuff like that to to have my first
[21:17] uh investment property uh and then
[21:20] Bitcoin came along and luckily saved me
[21:22] from that headache because now I speak
[21:25] with so many uh uh uh Real Estate
[21:29] Investors who are Real Estate Investors
[21:31] and shifting a little bit to bitcoin
[21:33] prior real real estate investor and are
[21:35] not now only in Bitcoin and they're all
[21:38] saying the same thing it's a lot of
[21:40] Heche uh the the passive income is not
[21:43] passive because you have to work for
[21:45] that a lot and it's way more easy to
[21:47] just build a business that makes sense
[21:49] uh than have real estate so like
[21:51] obviously a lot of uh millionaires were
[21:53] created with with real estate but it's a
[21:55] lot of headache it's it's it's not like
[21:57] oh yeah Buy
[21:59] the tenants will will pay and everything
[22:01] is is perfect so yeah I just had a
[22:03] question my mind that I never had in my
[22:05] mind in my 200 podcasts um why 21 did
[22:09] you ever research about that like I
[22:11] never researched that the topic why
[22:13] exactly 21 I I never I don't think I've
[22:16] ever researched it um and I don't know
[22:18] if there's an actual answer if it was
[22:20] just a number that Satoshi came up with
[22:23] but it's a good
[22:25] question yeah I just like oh when
[22:28] never asked that question doesn't
[22:30] doesn't come long that I did not ask a
[22:33] question um but yeah probably probably
[22:35] the the answer is not as interesting
[22:38] otherwise we probably would have known
[22:41] uh why but I will look it up after the
[22:42] podcast it's interesting uh perfect then
[22:46] um one question that I also have uh as
[22:48] you try to teach us with the books about
[22:51] uh money uh and also for young kids how
[22:55] how do you do that is this like a a
[22:57] normal story where you
[22:59] kind of get Bitcoin in the role or yeah
[23:01] and so um the uh we started writing um
[23:05] stories after launching our our card
[23:07] game and so our first book was released
[23:09] in 20 uh 2021 um and so at the time our
[23:13] daughter was you know oneish um and so
[23:16] we're very big into the reading um to
[23:19] your children side of things in our in
[23:21] our household you know during the day
[23:22] nighttime readings that sort of stuff so
[23:24] um you know when they're Todd infants
[23:26] and toddlers um you're very familiar
[23:28] with the traditional books around um
[23:31] that you probably grew up with you know
[23:32] good night Moon um you know everything
[23:35] else and so we had speaking of good
[23:36] night Moon read that to her many many
[23:38] times and it clicked well you know there
[23:41] should be Bitcoin books for kids so our
[23:43] our first book was actually good night
[23:45] Bitcoin and so it it tells the story of
[23:49] um Satoshi and how uh creating Bitcoin
[23:52] for their first time in a in a low
[23:53] stakes rhyming way and so uh you know
[23:56] everything we do is is done like I said
[23:58] using these characters and um if you ask
[24:01] many people who know about our company
[24:03] and and the families you know their kids
[24:05] know who uh Satoshi is because of of
[24:08] this character so this is Satoshi in our
[24:10] books he's our our most famous monster
[24:12] if you will um and so our stories are
[24:15] meant to just be that that low stakes
[24:17] entry point fun um and so between good
[24:19] night Bitcoin um our second book was uh
[24:23] if you give a monster a Bitcoin so these
[24:24] two are very very similar um more that
[24:27] infant toddler audience and then in July
[24:30] of this year we released our third book
[24:32] uh which is more of that five to to 12y
[24:34] old which is Satoshi Nakamoto and his
[24:37] Bitcoin advention and this is actually
[24:39] the first book we didn't actually author
[24:41] so we published it on behalf of our
[24:43] friend toor storite who um some people
[24:46] might know in the the Bitcoin community
[24:47] so he had actually written this book
[24:49] years ago uh had never gotten around to
[24:52] to going through the the creation
[24:53] process to putting it out there and and
[24:55] reached out to us and said hey um love
[24:57] what you guys doing I I want to have
[24:59] this book as part of you know um the
[25:02] books you guys are releasing let's make
[25:03] that happen and so about a month ago we
[25:05] we launched that and so it's a perfect
[25:08] um addition um to what we offer and um
[25:11] you know our goal is to make things fun
[25:14] low stakes they're not they're not very
[25:16] dense they're meant to just be um
[25:19] informative at the the highest of levels
[25:21] to get that child's interest start
[25:23] learning key wordss whether it's just
[25:24] learning the words Bitcoin um Satoshi
[25:27] how um nodes you know they're all worked
[25:30] in there but they're not things that
[25:31] kids you know it's not a textbook so
[25:33] it's not scary and daunting for them and
[25:36] and the nice thing is the kids that are
[25:39] being targeted for these books many of
[25:41] them are still um not able to read yet
[25:43] and so it's usually the parent in many
[25:45] cases or grandparent or whoever it is
[25:47] that's reading to the child and we've
[25:49] heard many stories and we've actually
[25:51] seen ourselves with family members
[25:53] around us who aren't binners yet where
[25:55] they've read the stories to our kids and
[25:58] that Spurs question in the adults head
[26:00] as well um and because they're their
[26:02] concept that they don't know and so
[26:04] while the stories are for kids if you
[26:07] have adults in your life who are who
[26:09] have children and then are being um are
[26:12] then reading these books to the child
[26:15] and they aren't bitcoiners yet the adult
[26:16] themselves they're also at least
[26:18] learning a little bit and peing their
[26:20] interest about what you know what is
[26:21] this Bitcoin thing and so it can work
[26:23] both ways how cautious were you with did
[26:26] you have like a time you of of course
[26:28] you had a time where you read the normal
[26:31] books to to the kids where you're like
[26:33] oh I I don't want uh my kid to hear
[26:36] that is is there something like that in
[26:38] in kids books also where like oh I don't
[26:40] like that my kid learns about that or is
[26:43] there like there's something in the book
[26:44] that I don't agree with so I don't want
[26:47] my kid to know I just thought about it
[26:49] now because like a kids's book is like
[26:51] um learning the kid and and pushing in
[26:53] in like in a in a positive uh good
[26:56] direction but you can also use the same
[26:58] thing in a in a NE negative way and
[27:00] because yeah kids are probably uh way
[27:03] more influ like you can influence them
[27:06] way better than someone that is like 40
[27:08] years old and already has some filters
[27:10] and some cards up yeah yeah there's you
[27:14] U you definitely have to keep your eye
[27:15] out um luckily you know we're pretty
[27:17] good at that sort of thing and um as
[27:20] we're reading you know as we're reading
[27:22] to our our kids you can kind of sense if
[27:24] something's coming that you want to to
[27:26] shy away from and so you can either May
[27:28] sometimes you maybe just need to change
[27:29] the word slightly if it's something
[27:31] small and you just kind of jump over and
[27:32] if they're not they're not reading yet
[27:33] so they don't know the difference um
[27:35] other times you might be reading a book
[27:36] that you realize is going in a a
[27:38] direction for whatever reason and that
[27:40] you don't um think it you want to take
[27:43] it you kind of just say okay you know
[27:45] let's switch to the next book or that
[27:46] sort of thing so as a parent yeah you
[27:48] you have especially as they're young and
[27:50] they're they're learning how to read you
[27:51] have that freedom to be able to to shift
[27:54] things around and and and such obviously
[27:56] as they become older and they're
[27:57] starting to read books themselves um
[27:59] some of that could get a little harder
[28:01] but um in general you know there's so
[28:03] many not even just speaking of Bitcoin
[28:05] but so many amazing books that are out
[28:07] there creative books fun ones um you
[28:10] know depending on your child's interest
[28:11] you know our daughter loves fairies and
[28:13] unicorns and so there's there's a
[28:15] plethora of books in our house that are
[28:17] about fairies and unicorns that you
[28:19] really don't have to worry about the uh
[28:20] the topic being anything inappropriate
[28:23] um when you're talking about that sort
[28:24] of stuff and so yeah it's a it's
[28:26] something to be conscious of as a parent
[28:29] um but it's also something that's fairly
[28:31] easy to to you know control and make
[28:34] sure that the um the messages that are
[28:36] being brought about are ones that you
[28:38] think are are safe and and appropriate
[28:40] for your
[28:41] kids all I also doing homeschooling or
[28:44] is is she in a school yeah so our our
[28:47] oldest is is homeschooled um our
[28:50] youngest will be as well once you know
[28:51] she she grows up um in a few years but
[28:54] yeah she's been homeschooled for a few
[28:55] years now technically um in America
[28:57] she'd be starting kindergarten um this
[29:00] year um but we've you know been using a
[29:03] homeschool um curriculum if you will um
[29:06] for a few years now and she's um she
[29:09] loves it has um she's a sponge and most
[29:13] kids are and so I think one of the
[29:15] things that many parents shy away from
[29:17] or maybe they're afraid of or they don't
[29:19] realize is just how soon you can start
[29:21] teaching your kids anything so I'm not
[29:23] just talking Bitcoin you know math
[29:25] science um how to read letter sounds you
[29:28] know start them as soon as you can you
[29:30] know as you're talking to them um and
[29:33] they'll they'll become interested and
[29:35] they'll they'll pick it up um our our
[29:38] older daughter is um very creative but
[29:41] also very um mathematic driven um she
[29:45] goes to sleep every night holding a
[29:47] calculator and doing math problems um
[29:49] and so it's uh extremely cute and
[29:52] heartwarming to see that she loves math
[29:55] so much uh but you know at the same time
[29:57] she'll spend hour hours a day coloring
[29:59] and drawing pictures and doing art um or
[30:01] doing science experiments so as soon as
[30:03] your kids start showing interest in
[30:06] certain subjects you know just help them
[30:08] learn along that process and um don't
[30:11] you know obviously homeschooling isn't
[30:12] for everybody um also some people just
[30:15] you know have going back to the earlier
[30:16] question talking about time you have to
[30:18] have time and a flexible schedule to be
[30:20] able to implement that sort of thing um
[30:23] but you know if you do have the time to
[30:25] be able to do it um it's something that
[30:27] I think both the the kid and the the
[30:29] family as a whole can benefit from if
[30:31] you watch or listen to my podcast on a
[30:34] regular basis I'll guess you already
[30:36] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[30:38] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[30:42] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[30:44] personal recommendation for Hardware

[31:49] completely new for you guys I partnered
[31:52] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[31:55] beautiful Bitcoin time pie that I ever
[31:58] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:01] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:04] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[32:07] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:10] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[32:13] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[32:16] make sure to check out the link in the
[32:18] description for this amazing coin
[32:20] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[32:23] amazing I love them so much it was
[32:25] really hard for me to pick the one that
[32:27] I want to have because there are a lot
[32:29] of great options I went with the new
[32:31] transparency Edition they're all limited
[32:35] so grab yours those will not be
[32:37] available for a long time but there will
[32:39] come new models and new amazing designs
[32:42] along the way it's interesting for me
[32:44] like the homeschooling part obviously
[32:46] like not everyone can do it but you
[32:49] probably have or maybe you have friends
[32:52] in your circle that who also have kids
[32:54] and they already had sent them to school
[32:57] do you see differences like do do you
[32:59] see like because you think like a lot of
[33:01] in in the school it's like oh you like a
[33:04] lot of people in the class you sit down
[33:06] uh you learn to not ask questions too
[33:08] much you you learn all all those
[33:11] horrible things that I think we know all
[33:13] about do you see already differences or
[33:16] is it too early yeah no definitely see
[33:18] differences and obviously every kid is
[33:20] every kid is different on their own and
[33:22] every school is different or preschool
[33:24] or daycare program um I think one of the
[33:27] biggest
[33:28] differences that we um see is
[33:32] particularly potentially in kids that um
[33:35] let's say have gone to not just school
[33:37] but daycare from a young age um and so
[33:41] they're around you know kids from you
[33:44] know for eight hours a day starting at
[33:46] let's say you know a year old or two
[33:48] years old whereas um in the case of our
[33:51] daughters um particularly the older one
[33:54] she she's grown up around us and adults
[33:57] um and so we've always spoken to her
[34:01] like she's an adult and given her the
[34:04] chance to be you know the mature child
[34:06] that we wanted her to be and that's
[34:08] that's what happened um but I think so
[34:10] many times when kids particularly very
[34:12] young kids start going off into daycare
[34:15] or Child Care roles where they're
[34:16] they're all around you know 5 10 15
[34:19] other kids all day with one adult is
[34:22] they get talked to like a child or a
[34:25] baby for the majority of their
[34:28] their days and so it doesn't give them
[34:30] the chance to gain that maturity that
[34:34] any kid could have if they're you know
[34:36] talk to them like an adult like same
[34:38] thing you know I was just saying around
[34:39] their sponges you know if you give them
[34:42] the opportunity to be mature and to
[34:44] start learning mature and responsible
[34:47] things and not talking to them as if um
[34:50] they can't do it you know they'll
[34:52] surprise you and they'll they'll do it
[34:53] and so um I don't think our you know
[34:57] like I said our daughter was three
[34:59] almost four when we took her to the
[35:01] first conference last year in Miami I
[35:03] don't think the majority of
[35:04] three-year-olds um would have been uh
[35:08] able to sit and be at a booth for 8 to
[35:12] 10 hours a day asking people if they
[35:13] want to buy a bracelet strangers being
[35:15] told no having fun like you just have to
[35:18] put them in those situations to let them
[35:20] learn um and you you know just the world
[35:24] will be their oyster after
[35:26] that that's that's I never heard that
[35:29] because like it's it's so interesting
[35:31] when you think about a kid growing up
[35:35] with more with adults how is how is with
[35:38] socializing is is she in in any groups
[35:41] like because when you put it in school
[35:43] when you put it in kindergarten it's
[35:44] it's pretty pretty easy because the the
[35:47] Social Circles there and it's also
[35:49] something that I noticed with myself and
[35:52] with with others like you learn how to
[35:55] socialize properly with like 20 years
[35:59] old because till then your Social Circle
[36:01] is just like oh where do you train and
[36:03] where do you go to school and that's
[36:05] like a Social Circle and maybe family uh
[36:08] and it's interesting that your kids have
[36:11] to learn this from from from way earlier
[36:14] on and are probably way better with like
[36:16] 14 than the most 20 year old yeah no and
[36:20] definitely you know I think to no
[36:22] surprise you know when you when people
[36:24] think about homeschooling they one of
[36:26] the first uh people not in the
[36:29] homeschooling side of things think oh
[36:30] well you know how does how does your kid
[36:32] make friends or how are they going to be
[36:33] around other kids whatever um but
[36:35] there's so many particularly you know we
[36:37] live in a big city so there's so many
[36:39] different opportunities out there and so
[36:41] she's always had you know different
[36:43] groups you know she plays soccer she
[36:45] plays baseball um she's on does you know
[36:48] swim she's um my wife is part of another
[36:51] homeschool um group that uh meets um
[36:55] weekly um um if you will so they're
[36:58] around other homeschool Kids U being
[37:01] beginning here in a few weeks um she'll
[37:03] be going to a it's called an enr home
[37:05] school enrichement Center a couple days
[37:07] a week where um they're able to have
[37:11] kind of both free play but also kind of
[37:15] structured learning experiences um
[37:17] putting on plays doing science
[37:19] experiments so that sort of stuff so you
[37:21] can you can homeschool in many different
[37:23] ways um and you can socialize make sure
[37:26] that social socialization is there in
[37:28] many different ways outside of using
[37:31] school as that main you know six hours a
[37:34] day where you're six to seven hours a
[37:35] day or eight hours if you're doing after
[37:37] school program um or even more than that
[37:39] you know where it's just a thought of as
[37:42] a daycare in my mind for most parents
[37:43] where yeah you're sending them there to
[37:45] learn but we all know like kids aren't
[37:48] learning for eight hours a day nor do
[37:50] you need to um you know it's surprising
[37:54] how fast and how little time especially
[37:57] when they're younger you need to put in
[37:59] to be able to have them start learning
[38:01] things you know if you know starting
[38:03] when she's 2 or three years old even
[38:05] before that you can start doing you know
[38:07] math problems that sort of stuff for 20
[38:10] or 30 minutes a day and the growth will
[38:13] be something you won't imagine so it
[38:16] doesn't take eight hours a day to to
[38:18] learn these things so get get your
[38:20] learning in how you need to and then you
[38:21] have so much other time in the day to
[38:23] enjoy all those other socializations
[38:25] with other whether it's families or
[38:26] whoever in and your homeschool Network
[38:28] that are out
[38:29] there that that's interesting yeah I
[38:32] love that a lot um obviously I was not
[38:35] homeschool I think I don't even know if
[38:37] it's in Austria possible I know it's not
[38:39] in Germany possible but I think Austria
[38:41] is actually possible um but it's uh it's
[38:45] it's a way better it's it's it's way
[38:47] better to to do it like that I think and
[38:50] also teaches responsibility I I think we
[38:53] we we kind of have a lack of of taking
[38:56] responsibility in our
[38:58] Society at Brad and which brings me a
[39:01] little bit to to my next question uh
[39:04] that I want to jump in uh because it was
[39:06] just in my mind now um Bitcoin Banks do
[39:10] do you think that we will get to a state
[39:12] where everyone is their own bank and
[39:14] they hold their own keys and they they
[39:16] they do their hard work themselves um is
[39:19] that even possible or uh is is that just
[39:24] like oh yeah there will be bigcoin Banks
[39:26] most people will hold with some
[39:28] custodian uh and like right now most
[39:31] people hold it with custodians only a
[39:33] small small small group of bitcoiners
[39:35] actually have a harder wallet I think
[39:37] the numbers are around like 5% or
[39:40] something like that what I heard I heard
[39:41] even numbers around 2% but this this
[39:44] seems very low uh but do you think that
[39:47] we come to a point where uh maybe with
[39:51] trends like homeschooling maybe with
[39:52] other trends that going on that we come
[39:54] to a more responsible Society that takes
[39:58] their own keys in their own hands yeah I
[40:01] think um that number will definitely
[40:03] grow um I think that's just inevitable
[40:06] but it'll definitely I think be slow
[40:08] slow goinging um and it probably won't
[40:11] be till these future Generations you
[40:13] know um you grow up learning about it
[40:16] and having it be second nature come
[40:18] about but with that said I don't think I
[40:21] think the traditional bank will probably
[40:23] Al ultimately go away or change if you
[40:26] will but there'll probably always be
[40:28] some need for custodia uh custody in
[40:32] some form whether it's for just hold
[40:35] holding it um or obviously uh the growth
[40:39] of you know Bitcoin back loans um people
[40:41] wanting to be able to to use it that way
[40:43] and and everything else you know there's
[40:45] going to need to be call them
[40:47] traditional financial instruments with a
[40:49] a Bitcoin wrapper on them if you will um
[40:53] that that come about and make it easy um
[40:55] for people to to live their life in that
[40:57] that way and you know the growth over
[40:58] the past couple years and those sort of
[41:00] things I think probably gets under
[41:02] represented I think a lot of has
[41:03] happened positively to be able to you
[41:05] know make um multisig easier to use in
[41:08] various ways um obviously uh during the
[41:12] last uh bare Market you know loans and
[41:15] that sort of stuff became a Hot Topic
[41:18] understandably since it wasn't done in a
[41:20] a safe way in many cases but there are
[41:22] safe ways ultimately that that can be
[41:24] done um down the line and so I think
[41:26] we'll see more and more of that and you
[41:28] know five years from now it's going to
[41:29] look completely different and 50 years
[41:31] from now it'll look even more
[41:33] different I think so too I hope so at
[41:36] least uh my hopes are but I always
[41:39] educate for self-
[41:42] custody but it's it's hard I even have
[41:44] friends that are full on 100% in Bitcoin
[41:46] and they all have it on exchanges and
[41:48] I'm like but it's already a good part
[41:50] that they have Bitcoin um Coming uh to
[41:54] one more question about parenting
[41:56] because it it is really interesting for
[41:58] me uh I did not plan to have those
[42:00] question on parenting but I think it's
[42:02] really interesting um you said also that
[42:04] you learn from very young age sales
[42:07] basically with standing on the booth
[42:08] something that I experienced the first
[42:10] time with 19 years old so I think uh
[42:13] having that from a young uh age on is is
[42:16] amazing to learn those small lessons
[42:19] with rejections with keep going and
[42:21] stuff like that so young already um and
[42:25] learning her to be way more independ
[42:28] than than any like other kid in that age
[42:32] um how do you have some some strategies
[42:36] some some things because you mentioned
[42:38] before the the age group I know that the
[42:41] the diff the average fewer of mine is
[42:44] like between 40 45 years old uh I know
[42:47] that most of them have kids like uh
[42:50] because most of my guests have kids most
[42:52] of when I ask in the community they they
[42:55] seem to have like kids or want to have
[42:58] kids which is amazing to see in the
[42:59] Bitcoin Community like the the kids rate
[43:02] is just way higher than I think in the
[43:04] in the average uh average uh Society out
[43:08] there um do you have some advice or some
[43:10] some some uh tip that you like you want
[43:13] to know that other parents also know
[43:16] about that um just kind of like the
[43:18] selling process and teaching and that
[43:20] sort of thing is that or just or or just
[43:22] in general like uh with what you learned
[43:24] with with parenting with raising
[43:27] independent critical thinking child that
[43:30] is not just doing what it's supposed to
[43:32] do yeah um I honestly the biggest tip is
[43:37] from a young age just treat treat them
[43:40] like an adult treat them like they're
[43:42] more mature than you think they are um
[43:44] talk to them um bring them into the
[43:46] conversations help them let them help
[43:49] your family make choices around you know
[43:52] different topics you know whether it's
[43:53] you know creating a a menu for the week
[43:56] um where you're going on vacation or you
[43:58] know what you're watching on TV does
[44:00] doesn't matter you know bring them in
[44:03] and treat them like they are one of you
[44:06] as opposed to um just a child um is
[44:10] probably the biggest thing because that
[44:11] level of maturity is what's going to
[44:13] then help them understand so many other
[44:15] things and give them the confidence to
[44:17] know that they can make those choices
[44:19] themselves down the line um and you know
[44:23] it's okay also to be wrong you know
[44:25] sometimes you know you make a choice alt
[44:26] together the wrong thing it's no
[44:28] different than you know when she's at
[44:29] the booth and somebody tells her no um
[44:33] and you know it just you know let it
[44:35] roll off ask the next person um and go
[44:38] on from there and so yeah I think it
[44:40] just treat them more mature than you can
[44:44] even realize they are and especially as
[44:46] as a baby and as an infant really cool
[44:48] and one thing that I also noticed with
[44:50] the uh products that that you have uh
[44:53] it's a hard topic waxel but uh uh just
[44:56] saw it you have to stem sign on on the
[44:59] products um is the this is like the the
[45:04] what is stem again it's like science
[45:06] technology engineering yeah exactly yeah
[45:09] um why is it on there like what is
[45:12] important about that yeah so great
[45:14] question um and so stem particularly
[45:16] here in the in the states um also
[45:19] sometimes known as Steam so that would
[45:20] be science technology education arts and
[45:22] math so two different versions of
[45:25] similar things um
[45:27] is um something that's very focused on
[45:30] and call it the the traditional
[45:32] education space in the states and and
[45:35] worldwide and so U there's an
[45:37] organization called stem.org um that
[45:40] does a few different things but one of
[45:42] it is um they authenticate books games
[45:46] other products to um say that they match
[45:50] different stem um uh curriculum so that
[45:54] it you know if you're using it in a
[45:56] education enironment you you know that
[45:58] it's teaching along the guidance of a
[46:00] stem program in some way and so you can
[46:02] CH it back to standards or whatever it
[46:04] may be and so for our purposes um we
[46:07] were able to get our our game um is stem
[46:10] authenticated as well as all three books
[46:12] and so the the importance of that really
[46:14] is making it easier for those whether
[46:17] it's a homeschool teachers or you know
[46:20] teachers in the traditional space uh
[46:23] libraries um stem centers after school
[46:25] programs you name it um if there's a a
[46:27] bitcoiner out there that wants to bring
[46:29] it into those settings they could C you
[46:32] know obviously they're probably the
[46:34] minority at this point U but they could
[46:37] bring it to their principal or their
[46:39] academic adviser whoever it is to be
[46:41] able to say you know I want to I want to
[46:43] wrap um you know the shammer game into
[46:45] my curriculum for XYZ um you know it's
[46:48] teaching about Bitcoin but you know it's
[46:49] stem authenticated you know it's going
[46:51] to teach them this standard this
[46:53] standard that standard um you know it
[46:55] helps that conversation um have less
[46:57] friction hopefully um so that they can
[47:00] we can start getting in there and
[47:02] there's um some great Bitcoin focused
[47:04] educational groups out there that that
[47:06] utilize um our game and our books in
[47:08] those sorts of ways so um whether it's
[47:10] uh ducon down in in Honduras that is Ron
[47:13] Academy um or there's a gentleman named
[47:16] Zach who does after school Bitcoin stem
[47:18] after school programs um in in the
[47:21] states back East um and some other ones
[47:23] worldwide you know being able to have
[47:25] that Authentication can help in those
[47:28] sorts of
[47:29] settings that's that's definitely uh in
[47:32] some settings you need that like label
[47:35] the the don't trust verify is not in all
[47:38] of our
[47:39] Lives if if everyone thinks like don't
[47:42] trust verify I think we would not need
[47:45] uh all those signs I mean I live in
[47:47] Austria like the the titles are really
[47:49] big here like if you have some ties in
[47:51] front of your name uh that's valued very
[47:54] highly and I don't get it it's yeah it
[47:58] doesn't doesn't mean anything for me um
[48:00] Coming closer to the end of the podcast
[48:03] uh what can we uh learn from you besides
[48:07] all the things that we already talked
[48:09] about uh on on the podcast oh geez um I
[48:12] think the biggest thing for maybe people
[48:14] out there besides kind of the learning
[48:16] about our products and parenting and
[48:18] Bitcoin families would be you know I
[48:20] think there's so many people out there
[48:22] with their own expertise in in various
[48:26] areas of of anything that maybe are you
[48:29] know have the back ideas in the back of
[48:30] their head about having you know they
[48:31] want to work in Bitcoin or they want to
[48:33] create something around Bitcoin or
[48:35] whatever U that Journey uh or dream
[48:38] could be and I think one thing would be
[48:41] just to say Do It um start start the
[48:44] podcast create the company create the
[48:47] product U I'm sure you feel similar you
[48:49] know before you started your podcast
[48:50] having an idea you know just do it
[48:53] you'll learn that's what we did like I
[48:55] said at the beginning you know what six
[48:58] years ago now uh we had literally we had
[49:01] never created a game before we had never
[49:03] written a book we had never created a
[49:05] plush toy we had never gone through
[49:06] manufacturing processes created a
[49:08] website e-commerce you name it zero
[49:12] experience um but we just dovee head
[49:15] first started created um learning the
[49:19] process the nice thing is you know as
[49:21] the Bitcoin Community continues to grow
[49:23] um there's so many awesome bitcoiners
[49:26] out there you know no different than how
[49:27] we got connected through store um I
[49:30] believe made the introduction and so you
[49:32] know worldwide doesn't matter where you
[49:34] are um you know everything's digital so
[49:37] um being able to tap into that Network
[49:39] and if you have questions uh you'll find
[49:41] people out there that that will help
[49:43] answer and and be able to to help guide
[49:46] you uh but the the first step and the
[49:48] biggest steps are going to be U yourself
[49:50] and being able to take that chance um
[49:52] obviously I'm not saying go quit your
[49:54] job tomorrow um in most cases but you
[49:57] know just just do it maybe it won't work
[50:00] but at least you could then say it work
[50:01] you did it you not can have that regret
[50:03] regret because you know I could sit here
[50:06] staying you know if sham maray stopped
[50:08] tomorrow for whatever
[50:09] reason myself and and mallerie and and
[50:12] our family I'd feel successful in not in
[50:16] that you know it's made us all this
[50:17] money or anything but in that it's I did
[50:21] it we did it together um so many people
[50:24] enjoyed what we created and um you know
[50:26] that's the satisfaction that we we
[50:28] wanted from it and you could have the
[50:30] same and I think the Bitcoin Community
[50:33] is a special one as it's really generous
[50:36] uh there are really helpful people in
[50:39] there uh it's it's one of the biggest
[50:42] problems uh that's kind of origin story
[50:45] how I came to have a daily Bitcoin
[50:47] podcast I just wanted to have a Bitcoin
[50:49] podcast once a week uh at first and I
[50:52] came from that sales background in it
[50:54] security where I like okay you right 10
[50:57] people and maybe one has a meeting with
[50:59] you and from all those 20 people that
[51:01] you have meetings with maybe one buy
[51:03] something uh but it's no problem because
[51:06] yeah but uh with with Bitcoin it's like
[51:08] oh you write 20 people hey do you want
[51:10] to be on my podcast and yeah 20 yes came
[51:13] back and and you don't even have the
[51:15] podcast yet like not not one episode out
[51:18] so that really surprised me and then my
[51:20] calendar was full with with uh podcast
[51:22] episode bookings and I had no podcast
[51:25] and I just like started I was like oh
[51:26] interesting yeah now now I have a
[51:28] podcast three times a week then four
[51:30] times and five times and then at some
[51:32] point I was like ah it I do it
[51:34] every day now uh and like one month
[51:36] later I was like oh I can actually live
[51:38] from that and and I do it fulltime since
[51:40] uh half no four months or five months
[51:43] now fulltime and it's it feels just uh
[51:46] so amazing so I can 100% attest to what
[51:50] you just said with just doing it and and
[51:52] and believing in yourself and then like
[51:54] yeah you will find if you
[51:57] if if you really like what you do and if
[51:59] you really are passionate about it and
[52:02] and and you actually try your best you
[52:05] probably will find a way sooner or later
[52:07] like it depends on on how long but you
[52:09] will find a way somehow really cool then
[52:12] uh yeah thank you already for for for
[52:13] the podcast we have one last thing the
[52:15] the end routine of the podcast where the
[52:17] previous guest is asking a question for
[52:19] the next guest without knowing who the
[52:20] next guest actually is uh and uh your
[52:23] question is an interesting one uh but a
[52:26] a little bit bit uh generic you can take
[52:28] it wherever you want to take it what is
[52:30] for you the main problem uh that Bitcoin
[52:34] is solving for you I think uh the main
[52:36] problem that Bitcoin solves for us would
[52:39] be um we touched on it earlier in the
[52:41] conversation is the the time aspect for
[52:43] our family um you know without quite
[52:47] honestly without Bitcoin and starting to
[52:48] learn about it years ago um we probably
[52:51] wouldn't be able to homeschool our kids
[52:52] we wouldn't be able to have as much um
[52:56] Freedom as we do um currently um because
[53:00] of it so you know I
[53:02] couldn't my wife and I talk about this
[53:04] all the time neither of us could imagine
[53:06] you know going back to the days when
[53:08] every you know five days a week having
[53:10] to get up drive somewhere sit in an
[53:13] office all day drive home do it all over
[53:15] again um you know it seems like a
[53:18] lifetime ago even though it wasn't very
[53:20] long ago um in reality but trying to
[53:24] imagine that um doing that now um after
[53:28] having kids and having the the time that
[53:30] we have with them is something that you
[53:32] know neither of us ever would want to go
[53:35] back to and B you know thanks to to
[53:37] taking the time to understand Bitcoin
[53:40] learn about it um and understand that
[53:42] the long-term value in it is is what
[53:44] it's provided us so that that would be
[53:46] my answer that is amazing H it's
[53:49] beautiful I feel like in in a sense like
[53:52] I made a post yesterday with like the
[53:54] only thing more valuable than and
[53:56] Bitcoin is time so I think there's a
[53:58] second best that that time is the second
[54:00] best asset you can have probably the the
[54:03] best one and Bitcoin is the second best
[54:06] uh and really cool thank you for taking
[54:07] the time already uh and uh where can
