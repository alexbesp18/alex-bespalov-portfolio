[00:00] the Bitcoin is actually going to be the
[00:02] secondary product that we get from
[00:04] mining what we want is the heat if you
[00:06] talk about Bitcoin as a money you hit
[00:09] brick walls because that's threatening
[00:11] if you talk about Bitcoin as an a
[00:14] solution to energy problems you find
[00:17] open doors if you bring electricity to a
[00:19] community they blossom they flourish you
[00:22] without electricity you're dead we've
[00:24] lived in China we've lived in Africa
[00:25] we've lived in the Middle East I know
[00:27] how the other half lives I know how we
[00:30] are in Europe it's the system that
[00:33] that's broken over time the Bitcoin
[00:36] flows to those people who produce the
[00:39] goods and services that you need whereas
[00:41] what we have at the moment is the pounds
[00:44] and the euros and the dollars flow
[00:46] towards those people who already have
[00:48] the pounds dollars and Euros if I've got
[00:51] property I can borrow money at zero
[00:53] interest or next to no interest I can
[00:55] buy more property not because I've
[00:57] produced anything that's good for
[00:58] society but just I have happened to be
[01:00] rich in the first place Satoshi Nakamoto
[01:02] is a man this is somebody who could be
[01:05] very focused who's worked and worked and
[01:07] worked and work this is what men do
[01:09] really really well they they get a
[01:12] problem and they can solve that problem
[01:14] thank God for the men in our lives when
[01:16] it comes to bitcoin adoption this is
[01:18] where I think we need the
[01:20] [Music]
[01:23] women then hi Rachel how you doing
[01:25] everything fine on your end yeah
[01:27] everything's good here I've just had the
[01:29] luxury of a nice six week Break um it's
[01:32] been a very very hectic two years and my
[01:35] body was screaming stop and I work for
[01:38] the best company in the world and they
[01:39] just said Rachel take your time take
[01:41] what you need and now I've just come
[01:43] back my first day of work was on Monday
[01:46] full of energy and full of optimism and
[01:49] ready to do the next stage of this
[01:51] incredible journey really really cool
[01:53] and with the company you mean terahash I
[01:56] mean terahash and it was so nice because
[01:58] it was my colleagues who came to me and
[02:00] said look Rachel what do you need and
[02:02] they could I went to Prague and I Prague
[02:06] was
[02:06] fantastic and I was exhausted after
[02:09] Prague and then I just found it really
[02:11] difficult you know it's been I've been
[02:13] doing this now for for two years and
[02:17] every day is exciting every day is new
[02:20] every day there's big news there's
[02:22] something there's something going on and
[02:23] I'm not complaining it's wonderful and
[02:26] it's exactly what we want to have for
[02:28] Bitcoin um but I'm no longer the
[02:31] youngest in the Bitcoin scene and yeah a
[02:36] woman of a certain age uh you have your
[02:38] your certain problems and my body was
[02:41] just saying hey take a break and I have
[02:44] learned in my life it's always important
[02:45] to listen to your body Health First and
[02:48] so yep I'm now back with renewed
[02:51] Vigor to do the next stage really really
[02:54] cool yeah and I think Terra is a a topic
[02:57] we really never discuss it on the
[03:00] podcast even though it has been like 250
[03:02] episodes or more like that um maybe as a
[03:05] beginning question what challenges do we
[03:07] face in the energy sector and how will
[03:10] Bitcoin help to resolve that and Bitcoin
[03:13] help to actually enhance those those
[03:15] things well we all know I mean you just
[03:17] need to look at your electricity bill to
[03:19] see what problems do we have in the
[03:21] energy sector and this is exactly how
[03:24] terahash was born to be honest so
[03:27] terahash is part of a of a group of
[03:29] companies
[03:30] a typical German midsize company family
[03:33] run and we produce car parts we produce
[03:37] Cosmetics uh we produce Plastics
[03:39] spraying technology and everything needs
[03:42] an awful lot of energy and we were
[03:44] suffering from the high price of energy
[03:46] so the the founder Chris cager thought
[03:48] well you know what you know he just
[03:50] discovered Bitcoin and he just
[03:51] discovered what Bitcoin mining can do
[03:54] maybe I can use Bitcoin mining you know
[03:56] if I if I put a few miners down in my
[03:58] seller and I can use the heat that comes
[04:01] from the Bitcoin mining for my
[04:02] production and this is exactly what he
[04:04] did so so it was all set up down in the
[04:07] seller and then you think well wait a
[04:08] minute if this is a solution for our
[04:10] company how many other companies are out
[04:13] there who are also looking for a
[04:15] solution who want to become uh more
[04:17] self-sufficient not so dependent on the
[04:20] fluctuation of the energy prices so we
[04:22] all know from the energy prices that uh
[04:24] we do have a problem with with energy in
[04:27] Europe we also know that Europe is
[04:29] trying to become more and more
[04:31] renewable and renewable energy although
[04:35] it's fantastic has a problem that it's
[04:37] intermittent you know when is the sun
[04:38] going to shine when is the wind going to
[04:40] blow and the grid needs to be kept at a
[04:43] very stable 50 hertz and that's a very
[04:46] easy thing to do when you have a gas a
[04:49] gas fired power station or a Coal Fire
[04:52] fired Power Station gosh that's a tongue
[04:55] twister um but when you've got wind and
[04:57] sun coming at at different times and
[05:00] then you have the demand you know
[05:02] normally you talk about this duck curve
[05:04] of demand so you have a very high demand
[05:06] in the morning and then around midday it
[05:09] it it gets less and then up to the
[05:10] evening it it gets more again as the
[05:13] households are needing their
[05:15] electricity and that's exactly the
[05:17] opposite of when you have solar you know
[05:19] solar the middle of the day is when you
[05:21] have your most solar so how do the grid
[05:24] how does the grid operator manage to
[05:26] keep the grid stable and this is a
[05:28] massive problem
[05:31] so what they're doing at the moment is
[05:32] they are paying or when I say they it
[05:35] always ends up with the taxpayer uh
[05:37] paying the solar Farms paying the wind
[05:39] farms to curtail their energy which is a
[05:41] complete waste we should not be
[05:43] curtailing and throwing away energy and
[05:46] there in lies the beauty of Bitcoin
[05:48] mining Bitcoin mining is is a customer
[05:52] who needs enormous quantities of energy
[05:55] but it has to be at the right price
[05:57] because you're competing on a global
[05:59] market
[06:00] uh but it's very flexible because I mean
[06:03] let's just to clarify Bitcoin mining is
[06:05] nothing more than a data center it's
[06:08] nothing more than
[06:10] computers and uh
[06:13] so because there's no final customer if
[06:15] you have a data center which is um an AI
[06:18] D identity Center or a Google data
[06:21] center or a Netflix data center there
[06:24] are customers on the other end who want
[06:27] constant service so you can't just turn
[06:29] them on and off with Bitcoin there's no
[06:32] customer and so they will they will take
[06:36] as much energy as they can get if the
[06:38] price is reasonable and the price is
[06:39] always reasonable when there's an over
[06:41] demand an over Supply in the market and
[06:44] then come the time when that uh Supply
[06:47] is needed for the households for the
[06:48] businesses the Bitcoin uh data centers
[06:52] can be turned off extremely quickly
[06:54] nobody suffers and so it's a wonderful
[06:58] tool for grid providers for G grid
[07:00] operators to solve this problem of keep
[07:02] keeping the grid stable and I mean we
[07:05] can go into this later I don't want to
[07:07] hold a great big monologue here but
[07:09] there's many different ways that we're
[07:10] looking into as to how Bitcoin energy
[07:13] can be a solution for a lot of the
[07:15] problems we have in Europe yeah the
[07:18] first time I really heard about that was
[07:20] with Lisa h on the podcast where she was
[07:22] on uh and she basically told me like
[07:25] yeah there like there are energy
[07:27] companies that pay other companies to
[07:30] take the energy from them because they
[07:32] have too much at certain times and I'm
[07:34] like wouldn't it be so easy to just like
[07:36] plug in a uh Bitcoin Manet there and and
[07:39] mine Bitcoin with that because you pay
[07:43] for the energy to be stored somewhere
[07:45] else uh and you could just like get paid
[07:48] to get the energy there like that that
[07:50] seems like a no-brainer but it seems
[07:52] like there's something holding the
[07:53] industry back yeah firstly
[07:57] education so if you look what The
[07:59] Narrative has been about Bitcoin and
[08:02] about Bitcoin mining in particular you
[08:04] know we're going to be using all the
[08:05] energy by 2020 uh was the message from
[08:08] the
[08:09] WF um and you still see it you know
[08:13] there is this mistaken belief that the
[08:15] use of energy is a negative thing and
[08:19] the use of energy is is lifegiving you
[08:21] know there's no problem with using
[08:22] energy you need to be careful where does
[08:24] the energy come from what is the energy
[08:26] source so we find that we have you know
[08:28] we spend an a lot of our time with
[08:31] terahash um educating companies on what
[08:34] Bitcoin mining really is and this is
[08:36] where it's very useful we have a
[08:37] research lab in our where the the people
[08:40] can come along and see Bitcoin mining in
[08:43] action and I have to be honest this was
[08:45] me as well I you know when I first
[08:48] learned about Bitcoin when I first
[08:49] understood Bitcoin then I knew I had to
[08:52] work for Bitcoin uh because I knew that
[08:54] it's something I want for myself and I
[08:57] want for my children and I want for the
[08:59] future but of course you've got this
[09:01] thing about um Bitcoin energy or is it a
[09:04] good thing is it a bad thing so the very
[09:06] first thing I did was an internship at a
[09:08] Bitcoin mining company unpaid for three
[09:10] months to learn you know what what
[09:13] what's it all
[09:14] about so so the education you know I
[09:17] walk then into terahash into the into
[09:19] the lab and you see well it's just
[09:21] computers and it's quiet and it's not
[09:23] dirty you know and you can see we have
[09:25] lots of media come and visit us we have
[09:27] politicians come and visit us and you
[09:29] can just see the light bulb go off and
[09:31] say wait a minute this isn't what I was
[09:33] expecting Bitcoin mining to be I think
[09:37] mining is an unfortunate word that we've
[09:40] chosen to call it because mining the
[09:42] connotation with mining is dirty it's
[09:45] digging and it's you know destroying the
[09:47] Earth and and nobody questions data
[09:50] centers there's never been a question
[09:51] about our data centers dirty so so first
[09:56] we have to change the
[09:57] narrative but secondly things are never
[10:00] as easy as you know it's never quite as
[10:02] plug and play as as you hope it would be
[10:05] and you have to remember with uh with
[10:07] Bitcoin it's a global market and so you
[10:10] are competing
[10:12] with Saudi Arabia where you can get
[10:15] electricity for two two cents for a
[10:17] kilowatt you're you're you're competing
[10:19] with the entire world on this and that's
[10:22] where it's difficult for for Europe in
[10:26] particular where the energy the cost of
[10:28] energy is higher to have an economic use
[10:31] case but that doesn't mean that
[10:34] it's impossible and I think this is
[10:37] going to be a massive Advantage for
[10:39] Europe because we are
[10:41] forced to be Innovative and we are
[10:44] forced to have Integrated Solutions to
[10:47] Bitcoin mining and we need to use every
[10:51] single scrap of what comes out of
[10:53] Bitcoin mining so I think we're going to
[10:56] find the Bitcoin is actually going to be
[10:58] the secondary
[11:00] uh product that we get for mining what
[11:03] we want is the
[11:04] heat so we've just we we're doing a
[11:07] fascinating project in Finland at the
[11:09] moment we've got one megawatt of a power
[11:11] plant one megawatt we've put miners
[11:14] there it's going online 1 of November
[11:17] we're heating 12,000 households with
[11:20] that and so then yeah it's it's awesome
[11:23] it's cool and when you look at it it's
[11:26] high tech it it's clean it looks good
[11:29] we're using Hydro power you know it's
[11:32] good all the way around and if we can
[11:34] get more of these projects up and
[11:35] running that people can see it and see
[11:38] it in action and say hey wait a minute
[11:40] this is fantastic and then of course if
[11:43] you're selling the heat you you can
[11:45] become more economically viable with
[11:48] Bitcoin mining because you're getting a
[11:50] secondary income from the Heat or you
[11:53] could get a secondary income from
[11:55] curtailing of the of the Grid or you
[11:58] could get a second income from CO2
[12:01] certificates you know so we have to be
[12:03] smarter we have to we have to work
[12:06] harder to get Integrated Systems but I
[12:09] think in the long run that is in the
[12:12] interest of Bitcoin because it needs to
[12:14] be as decentralized as we can and it has
[12:17] to have as much use for Humanity as as
[12:19] it can so I'm very excited about the
[12:22] prospect of Bitcoin mining in Europe
[12:24] it's just going to take a little bit
[12:26] longer really really cool I want to get
[12:28] also later this topic Europe versus
[12:30] America I think that's it's a really
[12:32] interesting topic but first I heard and
[12:34] this just came up in my head I heard I
[12:36] think a few weeks ago or even this week
[12:39] about Norway where they in a certain
[12:41] city they shut down a big uh Bitcoin
[12:44] miner facility and now the electricity
[12:47] prices shut up like I think I think 20%
[12:49] or something like that it was that was
[12:52] an amazing example for me I think they
[12:54] they turn it off because of the noise um
[12:57] is is that one of the the real world
[12:58] example where like actual people in
[13:00] their households to get the news and
[13:02] they're like oh we turned off the
[13:03] Bitcoin minor now we have to pay more
[13:05] for for those Energy prices that's seems
[13:07] to be an perfect example for that
[13:10] perfect and the other thing that that
[13:12] terahash did uh quite near the beginning
[13:14] is we set up an association called the
[13:17] European Bitcoin energy Association
[13:19] because we realized that we need to be
[13:22] spreading the news to European
[13:25] Regulators you know there are
[13:27] regulations coming up we need
[13:29] regulations I mean don't get me wrong on
[13:31] this
[13:32] um Bitcoin mining has been to a large
[13:35] extent cowboy country particularly up in
[13:38] the nordics you know you get your people
[13:39] going in there wanting to make quick
[13:41] profits and scadaddle so as soon as the
[13:43] price uh of electricity uh gets too high
[13:47] or or there are other things that maybe
[13:49] the the regulations change they've just
[13:52] left leaving their Hardware behind
[13:54] leaving unpaid bills you just need to
[13:57] look for exam example of what's
[13:59] happening in Paraguay what's happening
[14:00] in Ethiopia uh
[14:03] things and this is what we want to do
[14:05] with terahash we want to have a very
[14:08] clean regulated legal fiscally
[14:11] responsible environmentally responsible
[14:14] solution and so we we set up ebia uh
[14:18] getting on board all the people we need
[14:20] to have on board and you know if you
[14:22] want to be talking at the European level
[14:24] you need to have people sitting at the
[14:26] table who are used to talking at the
[14:28] European level so you have to be very
[14:31] careful who sits around the table and we
[14:32] managed to get a fantastic board around
[14:35] we have got swen hilderbrand who works
[14:37] for berser stutgart who's very heavily
[14:39] involved in the M regulations we've got
[14:42] haval rout who worked many years ago on
[14:44] the New Deal the European New Deal so he
[14:48] speaks the language but he understands
[14:50] what Bitcoin mining is and the
[14:51] potentials of Bitcoin mining we've got
[14:53] Mike Herman who works for tenant that's
[14:56] one of the four Big Grid providers of of
[14:58] German ger and again he's involved at
[15:00] the European level on energy regulations
[15:03] etc etc there's there's several more on
[15:05] the team and and we are growing that and
[15:08] a lot of the work is going on behind
[15:10] doors I mean yesterday we had a
[15:12] conversation with the European Member of
[15:13] Parliament well she's actually just been
[15:16] not elected for the second period but
[15:18] this is what this is what we need to be
[15:20] doing
[15:21] quietly quietly having those
[15:24] conversations behind closed doors and
[15:27] showing rather than telling so that's a
[15:30] wonderful example in Norway if you can
[15:32] go along and say look this is what's
[15:33] happened take the example of what
[15:35] gridless is doing in Kenya you know the
[15:39] the Bitcoin the the fact that Bitcoin
[15:41] miners are moving to the area and and
[15:43] hydrop plants are being built because of
[15:46] the Bitcoin mining because it's finally
[15:49] economically viable to build a plant the
[15:51] locals are having electricity for the
[15:53] first time in their life if you bring
[15:55] electricity to a community they blossom
[15:58] they flourish you without electricity
[16:00] you're dead you know so so we're slowly
[16:03] building up this portfolio another
[16:06] person who's sitting on the board of of
[16:08] uh ibba is Frederick vinker who's the
[16:11] CEO of prosperity digital another um
[16:14] well it's a data center they you know
[16:16] they put up data centers also very
[16:18] invested in in or interested in Bitcoin
[16:21] mining and coming with real life
[16:23] examples of this is where we're doing
[16:26] Bitcoin mining and this is the advantage
[16:29] for the environment for the society and
[16:31] for the World At Large and that way you
[16:36] can save hundreds of hours of talk talk
[16:39] talk because on paper it all looks good
[16:41] but does it really work in the practice
[16:43] so that's that's our main goal really
[16:46] interesting how big of an impact do
[16:49] things like Bitcoin ETFs and black rock
[16:52] now on on the other side of fighting for
[16:55] Bitcoin rather than against it and those
[16:58] big players coming into the scene has
[17:00] for the regulations on Bitcoin mining I
[17:03] think we were all a little bit surp
[17:05] everything helps for sure uh far more
[17:08] interesting for Bitcoin mining than the
[17:11] ETFs was for example an excellent report
[17:14] from KPMG about the the advantages of of
[17:18] Bitcoin mining and there's more and more
[17:20] reports coming out from these
[17:23] wellestablished well reputed uh
[17:25] companies you know Forbes has has um
[17:29] often regularly they have articles on on
[17:31] Bitcoin mining it all helps every little
[17:35] bit
[17:36] helps we came to the conclusion quite
[17:39] early on when we started towash two
[17:42] years ago we weren't 100% sure which
[17:44] direction we were going we the compan is
[17:47] actually called terahash do energy G in
[17:50] Bear yeah so we did know that we would
[17:51] be an energy company but we started off
[17:55] with these three um pillars of any
[17:58] energy education and
[18:01] events and we learned very quickly if
[18:04] you talk about Bitcoin as a
[18:07] money you hit brick walls because that's
[18:10] very threatening to to governments to
[18:14] that's threatening if you talk about
[18:16] Bitcoin as an a solution to energy
[18:20] problems you find open doors and so this
[18:24] is a wonderful strategy so let's talk
[18:26] about Bitcoin as as an energy solution
[18:29] we don't need to talk about Bitcoin as a
[18:31] money I mean if you think about it
[18:34] everybody in Europe has access to to a
[18:37] bank account as far you know maybe
[18:39] there's one or two who don't but you
[18:40] know the vast majority of people have
[18:42] access to a bank account it seemingly
[18:46] works you know once you study Bitcoin
[18:48] and you understand what money really is
[18:50] you see where it's not working but to
[18:54] the man on the clap and Omnibus you know
[18:56] the they think money works and so they
[18:59] don't think that there's a problem and
[19:01] if you don't think that there's a
[19:02] problem you're not interested in looking
[19:05] for a solution and it's only when you
[19:08] it's only when you feel the problem
[19:11] yourself that you're open to looking for
[19:14] a solution and every citizen in in
[19:16] Europe particularly in Germany feels the
[19:19] feels the Heat or that's doesn't feel
[19:23] the heat with with the problems with
[19:25] with electricity so you find that people
[19:27] are are more interested to listen to it
[19:31] I mean this is something that I'm
[19:32] finding with leam which is this
[19:34] organization that we started to get more
[19:37] women interested in
[19:39] Bitcoin what I find fascinating is that
[19:42] the women who tend to understand Bitcoin
[19:45] the earliest are people of my age
[19:48] because we know that we have a problem
[19:50] when it comes to pensions you know
[19:52] you've you might have taken years off to
[19:54] look after the children you and and we
[19:56] know that the pensions that we're
[19:58] getting close to having to rely on are
[20:02] not going to be enough to sustain us or
[20:04] to sustain us in a way that we're used
[20:06] to living and so those women have a
[20:10] problem and Bitcoin comes along as a
[20:12] solution to this problem and you find
[20:14] that it's much easier to talk to these
[20:15] women about what the the benefits of
[20:18] Bitcoin so once you've managed to
[20:21] establish the problem and the people
[20:22] recognize the problem and you're coming
[20:24] with a genuine solution that makes the
[20:27] whole thing much easier
[20:29] that surprised me the most when I
[20:30] started the podcast um now I have quite
[20:33] a big range of audience and now I see
[20:36] really like where where is the main
[20:38] cohort of the audience uh and it's
[20:42] basically 45 to 50 that's like the main
[20:45] cohort of my audience which is
[20:47] surprising because I'm just 25 and
[20:49] really surprising for me was uh I have
[20:52] three times as many people over 65 than
[20:56] under 25 like that they're like um I
[20:59] think you have to get to a certain age
[21:01] to actually understand what Bitcoin is
[21:03] actually solving because till 20 25 you
[21:07] probably especially if you're living in
[21:09] Europe or Austria Germany like you don't
[21:11] have those those kind of problems and
[21:13] you have
[21:14] to you have the problems but you don't
[21:17] know that you've got the problems you
[21:18] know they live in Cloud they live in
[21:19] Cloud Cuckoo Land and and you only think
[21:22] about today and you don't think about
[21:24] tomorrow I mean when I was 25 I did not
[21:26] think about my pension um and and so
[21:30] it's the problems are there for the
[21:32] young people and this is why I'm doing
[21:34] it this is why I do what I do my most
[21:36] important job is I'm the mother of four
[21:38] children and my children are all in the
[21:42] age you know between uh 20 21 and and
[21:46] 28 and I can see the difference in the
[21:49] world that they're living in they've got
[21:51] good jobs most of them most of them and
[21:55] yet and and their Partners as well can
[21:58] they forth to get on the property ladder
[22:00] no they haven't got a hope in heck
[22:02] unless the parents put in some money but
[22:04] that's not a sustainable solution so
[22:06] even though they've got good jobs they
[22:09] cannot afford to get on the property
[22:10] ladder and if you can see no sense in
[22:14] Saving you spend you know so they'll go
[22:17] on holidays four times a year they do
[22:19] fantastic things but this is very
[22:21] short-term thinking and you know the
[22:24] other reason why if I didn't have my
[22:26] children I wouldn't be sitting here
[22:27] today it was my son um Patrick who's who
[22:31] was the Bitcoin of the family and it was
[22:33] him who came to me in 2017 and said Mom
[22:37] you need to look at this this new
[22:39] technology I I basically ignored the guy
[22:43] for for three years and I'm so grateful
[22:45] for him I mean I did we did buy a little
[22:47] bit of Bitcoin at the time kind
[22:49] of yeah okay Patrick buy a little bit
[22:52] for me and for my husband and buy a
[22:53] little bit for each child and of course
[22:55] we bought it at the peak in 2017 and
[22:58] went from 17,000 down to 3,000 so I
[23:01] obviously thought it was a bit of
[23:02] rubbish and the children also it was
[23:04] their Christmas present and they also
[23:06] thought well that was a rubbish
[23:07] Christmas present uh but Patrick
[23:10] doggedly kept on and kept on and kept on
[23:13] and kept on trying to educate us and
[23:16] then in 2020 when the pandemic hit and
[23:19] we suddenly all lost our jobs we were
[23:21] living in Africa and we had to leave
[23:23] Africa and I suddenly found myself with
[23:25] time on my hands I started reading and I
[23:28] started researching and then I had a
[23:31] light bulb moment when I read the book
[23:33] from Alex gladstein check your financial
[23:35] privilege because we've lived in many
[23:37] countries we've lived in China we've
[23:39] lived in Africa we've lived in the
[23:40] Middle East I know how the other half
[23:43] lives I know how privileged we are in
[23:46] Europe and when I read that book and it
[23:48] was just the system's broken it's the
[23:51] system that that's broken it just was
[23:54] this light bulb moment for me and I knew
[23:57] I had to stop everything that I was
[23:58] doing and work for Bitcoin for my
[24:01] children because I want my children to
[24:05] have a sustainable future and an
[24:08] optimistic and a hopeful future and I
[24:10] see that very strongly if if you do not
[24:14] have a healthy money you do not have a
[24:18] healthy society and when we were living
[24:20] in South Africa it's you know obviously
[24:23] we were the privileged experts but you
[24:26] will find this compound of where you're
[24:28] living with your swimming pool and your
[24:30] Gardener and your maid in a beautiful
[24:32] big house and then outside your walls
[24:34] which have got barb wire and men with
[24:36] guns to protect you you've got a shanty
[24:39] town the rich are getting richer the
[24:41] poor are getting poorer and the same
[24:44] thing is happening here we are not quite
[24:46] at the same stage as but we're getting
[24:49] there we are getting there I mean just
[24:52] my daughter the other day she she wrote
[24:55] in the family chat my rents just gone up
[24:57] by 9% she lives in London my rent just
[24:59] gone up by 9% the last three years my
[25:02] rent went up 8% each year my salary's
[25:05] gone up
[25:06] 2% so slowly slowly
[25:10] slowly the you know the middle classes
[25:13] are getting poorer poorer poor poorer
[25:15] the riches rich ones are getting richer
[25:17] and this is disastrous for a society you
[25:20] cannot have a society a healthy Society
[25:23] with such disparities where there's no
[25:26] way for the Have Nots to become a have
[25:32] and the beauty with Bitcoin is obviously
[25:35] at the beginning it's going to be
[25:37] unfairly distributed that's the nature
[25:39] of the beast that's that's life if
[25:41] you've understood what Bitcoin is before
[25:43] other people have understood it and
[25:44] you've invested in it you're going to
[25:47] have an advantage if if what we believe
[25:49] happens is going to happen but the
[25:51] beauty of Bitcoin is over time the
[25:56] Bitcoin flows well the satoshi's flow to
[26:00] those people who produce the goods and
[26:02] services that you
[26:04] need whereas what we have at the moment
[26:07] is the pounds and the euros and the
[26:10] dollars flow towards those people who
[26:13] already have the pounds sh dollars and
[26:15] Euros if I've got property I can borrow
[26:18] money at zero interest or next to no
[26:20] interest I can buy more property not
[26:22] because I've produced anything that's
[26:24] good for society but just I happen to be
[26:26] rich in the first place and that is what
[26:29] Bitcoin is going to change it's going to
[26:32] take a heck of a long time this is not
[26:34] something that's going to happen in my
[26:35] lifetime but at least you know you're on
[26:38] the proper trajectory that then
[26:42] everything in life is about
[26:44] energy and you want the energy to be
[26:46] flowing to those who who have earned it
[26:50] and that's what Bitcoin is for me wow
[26:52] that's that's that's beautiful there
[26:54] were a lot of interesting um a lot of
[26:57] interesting topics in there
[26:59] um the first one I want to start is the
[27:01] power of orange peing your own family uh
[27:03] what Patrick did was was uh really cool
[27:05] because he introduced it to the to the
[27:07] family and I think that's what um I also
[27:10] really am passionate about like first
[27:12] start with your loved ones when you want
[27:14] to orange pill when you want to
[27:15] introduce Bitcoin to someone like with
[27:17] your family that's probably the the the
[27:20] highest return for yourself and and for
[27:22] your family to to to get across uh okay
[27:26] well you've hit on quite a war point
[27:28] there Robin because our family is pretty
[27:31] split down the middle on this one
[27:36] so so he hasn't managed to have as much
[27:39] success or or me as well and and you
[27:42] know you know what I came to the
[27:44] conclusion we've done it wrong we've
[27:47] done it wrong
[27:49] because missioning never
[27:52] works and so you know at the beginning
[27:55] when Patrick was you know hammering
[27:57] hammering hammering I had to ban him
[27:58] from the family chat or not ban him but
[28:01] ban the topic of Bitcoin so I said
[28:03] listen let's open a second chat let's
[28:05] have a a a family Bitcoin chat and any
[28:08] family member who wants to take part can
[28:11] take part but we can't force it you know
[28:13] so then it was interesting to see who
[28:15] did take part in this in this
[28:18] chat but you
[28:21] know I think that some of us see Bitcoin
[28:23] as an investment I don't see Bitcoin as
[28:26] an investment of course it is is but for
[28:29] me Bitcoin is far bigger than investment
[28:32] and I think that with us being so
[28:35] Evangelical about it we've actually put
[28:39] off members of the family and and that
[28:42] wasn't clever and I've come to the
[28:45] conclusion and helped along the way by
[28:47] some wonderful people that I've met in
[28:49] my life um show don't
[28:53] tell so if people aren't open to a
[28:56] subject of course you can talk about it
[28:58] I mean I've actually bought Bitcoin for
[28:59] some of my friends who I know
[29:01] desperately need it but they don't have
[29:03] the money to buy and I understand you
[29:05] know they they can't speculate they're
[29:06] living hand to mouth and so if I go
[29:08] along to to my friends and say hey come
[29:10] on put 500 in this they're going to say
[29:13] are you mad you know I I need to buy a
[29:15] new washing machine um so they cannot
[29:18] afford to make a mistake so even though
[29:20] we think that this is as this is the
[29:24] safe bet keeping your money in euro is
[29:26] not the safe bet I completely understand
[29:28] that they can't think like that and so I
[29:31] think it's better to take a step back
[29:34] with the orange pilling when people are
[29:37] ready to learn about it they will come
[29:38] to you and then and then and then it's
[29:42] easy and so what you need to be doing is
[29:44] showing by the way that you live your
[29:48] life so you decide for yourself that
[29:50] Bitcoin is the way that you want to go
[29:52] and that is the life that I want to lead
[29:55] and so I will make sure that I can pay
[29:58] my rent in in in Bitcoin or I receive my
[30:02] rent in in in in Bitcoin and I live in
[30:06] in a way that I think is sustainable and
[30:09] then if people look at that and think oh
[30:11] I wonder what she's doing and why she's
[30:13] more relaxed about what's going on in
[30:14] the world uh compared to us that has a
[30:17] much bigger effect than trying to slam
[30:22] people into believing the same thing
[30:23] that you believe and at the end of the
[30:26] day Robin none of of us know the
[30:29] future none of us know the future and so
[30:32] is this what's going to happen I don't
[30:35] know I know that the current monetary
[30:38] system is dead and dying it's it is
[30:42] dying I mean it's pure
[30:44] mathematics that debt pile of debt is
[30:47] going to keep growing whatever they do
[30:48] the pile of debt is going to keep
[30:50] growing and I mean we lived in we lived
[30:53] in South
[30:54] Africa and went over to Zimbabwe and
[30:58] you've got lying on the floor you've
[31:00] still got the trillion dollar Zimbabwe
[31:03] dollars it's lying on the floor it's
[31:04] toilet paper you know and I think people
[31:07] can't conceive that this could one day
[31:09] happen to to the euro but it will it
[31:12] will I mean we probably won't have any
[31:14] dollars lying on Euros lying on the
[31:16] floor because by then we'll all be on
[31:17] cbdcs and there'll be no uh there'll be
[31:20] no cash cash to lie around it's
[31:24] happening already it's happening already
[31:27] just look at the price of houses we know
[31:29] that it's happening so one thing we can
[31:31] say for certain the monetary system that
[31:33] we have now is not sustainable for for a
[31:36] healthy Society but what we cannot say
[31:39] for certain is is Bitcoin going to be
[31:41] the next thing I believe it will but we
[31:44] cannot we do not know the future if you
[31:46] watch my podcast already for more than
[31:48] two times you know how extremely
[31:51] passionate I am about self- custody and
[31:54] the first very very very important step
[31:56] to self- custody
[31:58] is always getting yourself a hardware
[32:02] wallet and I have one for you here this
[32:04] is the Bitcoin only Edition from the
[32:06] bitbox my favorite single signature
[32:09] Hardware wallet on the market another
[32:12] really important piece of self- custody
[32:15] if you have a hardware wallet is the
[32:17] backup of the seat phrase and bitbox
[32:20] made the perfect solution to back up
[32:22] your seat phrase they made a reusable
[32:25] steel wallet check out that P it's
[32:28] durable and extremely heavy if I put it
[32:31] on the desk I seriously fear for my own
[32:35] table it's so so heavy and durable I
[32:38] love it this is where my seed phrase is
[32:41] secure go to bitbox do Swiss SL robobin
[32:45] to get your bitbox and if you use code
[32:48] Robin you even get 5% off of your
[32:52] complete order and the next step is to
[32:55] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:57] indiv individual you have to have the
[32:59] most secure self custody setup you have
[33:02] to secure your own devices you have to
[33:05] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:08] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:10] where you live you even want to have a
[33:13] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[33:16] in case something goes really really
[33:17] wrong and through all those steps the
[33:19] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[33:22] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[33:25] way.com SLP partners Robin you even get
[33:29] a 30 minute free call to find out how
[33:32] you can level up your sovereignty and
[33:35] last but not least I have something
[33:36] completely new for you guys I partnered
[33:40] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[33:43] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[33:46] saw created by anyone look at that
[33:49] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[33:52] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[33:55] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[33:58] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[34:00] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[34:04] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[34:07] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:10] watch collections you have the date of
[34:13] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[34:16] there and of course also the block
[34:18] height and which EPO we are currently in
[34:22] I love the level of detail they put in
[34:25] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[34:27] check check out those amazing coin
[34:29] vilante time pieces down in the
[34:32] descriptions I love those watches so so
[34:35] much and that that makes it um so hard
[34:38] to Orange build because uh you you know
[34:41] all those things and you know this this
[34:43] this euro thing is not going to be
[34:45] sustainable um but then you have like
[34:47] your brothers your sisters your your
[34:49] aunts your uncles your your mom dad and
[34:51] all all all the rest of it they're like
[34:53] oh yeah I I don't want to be in Bitcoin
[34:55] because it's too risky for me and they
[34:57] have all the money in Euro and you're
[34:59] like oh I could not sleep like that so I
[35:01] think that's that's where the the
[35:02] missionary things and I want to Orange
[35:04] peill them because I want to save them
[35:06] comes out it's it's hard to overcome
[35:08] that and be relaxed and like okay I will
[35:10] show them uh that that Bitcoin is better
[35:13] over time with me living a happy and
[35:16] great life and then they they might come
[35:19] um it it helps definitely in my case to
[35:22] be really vocal about it on social media
[35:24] so I don't have to be vocal in my
[35:25] physical life about it so people that
[35:27] interested in Bitcoin come automatically
[35:29] to me without me bringing the topic up
[35:32] uh but it it's a I remember the first
[35:34] few one two years it was really hard for
[35:36] me to not scream Bitcoin at every
[35:38] Bitcoin any conversation I think it's
[35:42] when you've understood it yourself when
[35:44] you first understood it yourself you
[35:45] just think oh gosh this is wonderful
[35:48] this is the Panacea of all our evils and
[35:50] you want to shout it from the rooftops
[35:52] and I think once you've been doing it
[35:54] for a couple of years you realize that
[35:56] that strategy is is not the best
[35:58] strategy and I mean let's face it Robin
[36:00] you don't need much Bitcoin there's 21
[36:04] million or there's going to be slightly
[36:05] less than 21 million and there's eight
[36:06] billion people on this Earth how much
[36:09] Bitcoin do you need to make a difference
[36:11] to your life and we'll be able to we if
[36:14] what we think comes to be we can help
[36:17] our families so so it's fine you can
[36:20] relax about that they they will be fine
[36:23] it's the families where there isn't a
[36:24] bitcoiner in the family uh that will
[36:26] maybe suffer more but you know I also
[36:29] have a very strong feeling which is why
[36:31] I do which is why I do terahash and and
[36:34] ibia I love Europe I mean I was born in
[36:37] the UK um and then I met a German at
[36:40] University and uh as is often the case
[36:43] with the women ran after after him he
[36:45] was he was a German and that's where we
[36:48] started this Odyssey all around the
[36:49] world it was mostly with with his work
[36:51] that we were sent to all these different
[36:53] countries and because I've lived in so
[36:55] many different countries
[36:58] I know how wonderful it is in Europe you
[37:00] know I I can I don't have a fence I
[37:03] don't have a gate um this these things
[37:06] are changing I don't want it to change I
[37:09] want it to stay the way it is or or
[37:12] improve and that depends on us we are
[37:17] the
[37:18] people we are the people and it's up to
[37:21] us to take a stand and stand up and go
[37:24] I'm not doing that that's wrong I want
[37:27] to go go on this
[37:28] path and if we all disappear then we
[37:32] then the ship is going to go down even F
[37:35] further F faster I mean don't get me
[37:38] wrong I will not go down with the
[37:41] ship so if if I ever get the feeling
[37:45] that you know if they want to try and
[37:47] take my Bitcoin away from me I'm gone
[37:49] I'm I'm not going down with the ship but
[37:52] I will do everything I
[37:54] can to turn the ship around in my very
[37:57] very limited capacity but you know it's
[38:00] amazing what a small group of people can
[38:03] achieve a small group of very determined
[38:07] people can achieve great things and and
[38:09] if you look at the majority of the world
[38:11] they're they're sheep they're not
[38:13] thinking at all they're just not
[38:15] thinking at all they're not noticing
[38:16] what's what's going on they're living in
[38:19] their day-to-day life full of
[38:21] consumerism and thinking okay that's
[38:23] going to make me happy and that's going
[38:24] to make me happy and that's none of
[38:26] that's going to make you happy
[38:28] you don't need much to make you happy
[38:30] but you need the right things to make
[38:32] you happy and we haven't got that in
[38:33] Europe I mean one of my absolute
[38:35] children women are not having children
[38:38] anymore they're just not look at the
[38:40] birth rates why so I I've got a
[38:45] University degree but I took quarter of
[38:48] a century off to bring my children up
[38:50] because they're my most important asset
[38:52] why would I want to give birth to my
[38:55] most precious pre precious thing and
[38:58] give it into the hands of somebody else
[39:00] to bring up with their values and their
[39:03] but I was in a very privileged position
[39:06] that I could afford to stay home with my
[39:09] children and the majority of women
[39:11] nowadays you need to have two
[39:13] incomes Society tells you all the time
[39:16] being a mother is not worthy I hate the
[39:19] expression working
[39:21] mother I have never worked so hard in my
[39:24] life as when I was bringing up my
[39:26] children and I find it a complete insult
[39:29] when people talk about working mothers
[39:31] mothering is a full-time job but it's
[39:34] not recognized by Society you don't earn
[39:36] any money doing it you're looked down on
[39:38] it was really funny when I had my four
[39:40] little children and we just built a new
[39:42] house here in Germany and I go along to
[39:44] a shop to buy a new kitchen and I had to
[39:46] fill out this form and one of the for
[39:49] one of the questions was what's your job
[39:52] and I hate the phase uh the phrase
[39:55] housewife house FR in German and so I
[39:57] always I'm not interested in my house
[39:59] but I'm interested in my children so I
[40:00] wrote mother and then the the guy
[40:02] sending me the kitchen said are you just
[40:05] a
[40:06] mother and I said are you just a kitchen
[40:09] Celler you know and and it's this he
[40:11] didn't mean any harm by it but it's the
[40:14] perception when I I would go to I would
[40:17] go you know my my husband was CEO and on
[40:20] the board and I've been to events
[40:22] meeting Angela Merkel and all this kind
[40:24] of stuff so I've I've done all that and
[40:25] when you talk to the people and they say
[40:27] say what you do and you say I'm a
[40:29] mother they ignore you you are no longer
[40:32] interesting for their conversation and
[40:34] this is what has got to change if we do
[40:37] not produce the Next Generation it is
[40:41] the most valuable job that anybody can
[40:44] do to produce the Next Generation and to
[40:47] bring them up in a way that makes
[40:49] valuable valuable human beings if we're
[40:52] putting such a low price on this we are
[40:56] doomed as a Society if you look at all
[40:59] of the jobs that women with their
[41:02] natural femin and I know it's always a
[41:03] bell curve and you're going to have some
[41:05] women who've got more masculine traits
[41:06] and you're going to have some men who've
[41:07] got feminine traits but on the whole
[41:10] women are interested in people and men
[41:12] are interested in things and all of the
[41:14] jobs that women are good at which is all
[41:16] to do with nurturing whether it's in the
[41:18] kindergarten teaching nursing whatever
[41:22] they're the worst paid jobs and the jobs
[41:25] that are what men good at which is
[41:28] engineering and what which are very
[41:30] valuable I'm not saying they're valuable
[41:32] they're the best paid jobs and we're
[41:34] making a complete mistake there with a
[41:37] society women are fantastic and they're
[41:40] very different to men men are fantastic
[41:43] and they're very different to women and
[41:45] if we have both of them working together
[41:49] we will have the best society that you
[41:50] can hope to get but what women try to do
[41:53] nowadays is they try and behave like men
[41:56] so if I want to get a head in my job I
[41:59] have to put my elbows out and say look
[42:01] at me look at me look at me aren't I
[42:02] brilliant aren't I number one aren't I
[42:04] strong and this is not in my nature my
[42:07] nature is to bring people together and
[42:09] and nurture and you know like build and
[42:12] and and
[42:13] grow and I think this is a mistake that
[42:15] women made they try to be more like men
[42:18] in order to be successful but what we
[42:20] should be saying is wait a minute I'm
[42:24] who I am and I'm good as I am don't
[42:27] Empower me I hate the word empowering
[42:29] women we don't need to be empowered we
[42:31] are fine as we are but what we need is
[42:35] that Society
[42:38] recognizes the qualities that a woman
[42:40] brings to the table are equally as
[42:42] valuable as the qualities that a man
[42:44] brings to the table and then I think we
[42:46] there's no stopping us humans are
[42:49] wonderful and we can achieve the limit
[42:51] we can achieve the sky but recognize
[42:55] what each person brings to the table
[42:58] and and why is it that the money all
[43:01] flows to to the men in society is not
[43:04] good they're the ones who start the wars
[43:06] and they're more aggressive and and you
[43:08] know is that a good thing and this is
[43:11] why I started leam of wange because the
[43:14] same thing is going to happen with
[43:15] Bitcoin women hear Finance technology oh
[43:20] I'm not interested in finance and
[43:21] technology so bitcoin's nothing for me
[43:24] and so 98% of Bitcoin at the moment and
[43:26] I'm making that figure up because I
[43:28] haven't got a clue but it must be
[43:29] something like that is in men's hands
[43:31] you just need to go to a Bitcoin
[43:33] conference it's usually men on the stage
[43:35] it's usually men in the audience that
[43:37] will not be a healthy Society if women
[43:40] are thrown right back down to where we
[43:42] used to be with absolutely no finances
[43:45] to our names and completely dependent on
[43:47] on on the men in our lives That's not
[43:49] healthy uh and so that's why I spend a
[43:52] lot of my time and energy on trying to
[43:54] encourage women you don't have to be you
[43:57] don't have to be good at Tech you don't
[43:59] have to understand finances to use
[44:01] Bitcoin and to know that Bitcoin is
[44:03] going to be of use to you and your
[44:05] family and your children and
[44:08] whoever sorry that was very long
[44:11] sorry but but there are some amazing
[44:14] Snippets in there I loved it a lot and I
[44:16] think that that this was an extremely
[44:20] great like I loved it a lot and the one
[44:23] thing that I think a lot of people
[44:24] actually don't get that the birth rate
[44:25] is a threat to to humanity right now
[44:28] it's it's like the birth rate is not
[44:29] looking good we we're getting more
[44:31] people because we live longer but we're
[44:32] not producing enough new people if if if
[44:35] that continues like that we will uh
[44:37] extinct at some point we will be extinct
[44:40] and look at the Nations who are
[44:41] producing children you know so so if we
[44:45] want our values and our culture to to
[44:49] continue we need to be producing and I
[44:52] like the European way of life you know
[44:54] I've lived in I've lived in in Dubai um
[44:58] where where the women where the AA and
[45:00] the I don't want to live like that I
[45:02] think you know and but I mean they're
[45:04] welcome to do whatever they want to but
[45:06] I don't want to live like that and so we
[45:09] need to make sure that if we think that
[45:11] our our culture and our value is is
[45:13] precious and I do then we need to make
[45:16] sure that we're bringing up the Next
[45:18] Generation and I have no problem Hey
[45:20] listen I married a foreigner my
[45:21] daughter's getting married to a Russian
[45:23] in in six weeks I've The More We Get
[45:26] Together married together the
[45:28] better um but you know it's like take
[45:31] the situation that we've got in in
[45:33] Germany at the moment with the with the
[45:35] immigrants that came in what did we do
[45:37] we took all these people in we dumped
[45:40] them in containers normally next to the
[45:42] rubbish dump which is if you go to any
[45:44] Village wherever you find the recycling
[45:47] uh of that Village you'll find the
[45:48] container where all the immigrants are
[45:50] stuck into um getting angrier and
[45:53] angrier because it's mainly young men
[45:55] and I've got three young men myself and
[45:57] I know if I was to stick them into a
[45:59] container for months and years at a time
[46:02] they would become very frustrated I mean
[46:04] I've actually got one who lives in my
[46:05] house with me Muhammad um and and that's
[46:08] what you need to do that they that they
[46:11] they get to know who you are and they
[46:13] get to know what your values are and if
[46:15] you want to come and live in Germany um
[46:18] you're very welcome but these are the
[46:19] rules that we play by this is the
[46:21] language that you need to learn and and
[46:23] and this is what we expect of you to be
[46:25] a you know a a desirable member of of
[46:29] German Society we didn't do that at all
[46:33] and then we're surprised when when
[46:35] problems happen so I have no problem
[46:38] with um you know I mean I'm an English
[46:40] person living in Germany I am now German
[46:42] I'm really proud of the fact that uh
[46:45] that I've taken on the German
[46:46] citizenship I'm probably more uh
[46:48] patriotic than your your average average
[46:51] German I'm I'm I'm humbled that another
[46:54] country was prepared to give me their
[46:56] their citizens ship but I think that the
[46:59] the Western values are really important
[47:03] and we are losing them freedom of speech
[47:06] we we're losing we're losing all of this
[47:09] so we need to we need to fight for
[47:11] it I have a theory with with Bitcoin
[47:14] 100% And you can shoot me Satoshi
[47:17] Nakamoto is a man obviously it's a man
[47:20] this is somebody who could be very
[47:23] focused who's worked and worked and
[47:25] worked and worked and obviously on the
[47:26] shoulder of all those fantastic people
[47:28] who came before but if you look at who
[47:30] are the core developers of Bitcoin it's
[47:33] 90% men this is what men do really
[47:37] really well they they get a problem and
[47:39] they can solve that problem thank God
[47:41] for the men in our lives when it comes
[47:44] to bitcoin adoption this is where I
[47:46] think we need the women because the
[47:48] women are the nurturers of society so
[47:50] take Bitcoin as if it's a child now that
[47:54] it's up to the women it's time for the
[47:55] women to step up and make this child
[47:58] this wonderful child ready for society
[48:01] we need products that the society can
[48:03] use that it's not as complicated you
[48:05] know as it is and this is where I see
[48:08] women now playing a big role in the
[48:12] adoption of
[48:13] Bitcoin yeah you said that before to me
[48:15] in the recording and I I really like
[48:17] that that you see um women now as a key
[48:20] to the Bitcoin adoption uh going forward
[48:23] and I think that's a great point because
[48:25] uh men are good in making something work
[48:28] and and women are making something work
[48:30] really nicely and also like it looks
[48:33] nicely the UI design if we stay in the
[48:36] app design like men are doing the the
[48:38] things that okay it should it gives the
[48:40] money from A to B but how does the UI
[48:42] look how does the the interface look and
[48:44] that's missing in Bitcoin a lot of
[48:46] people are like oh that Hardware wallet
[48:48] uh the S if you're making open up like a
[48:50] spare wallet it's like oh what I do
[48:54] here it's it's like even for in the
[48:57] beginning it was like really like yeah I
[48:59] have to watch now 5 10 YouTube videos to
[49:02] even know where the buttons are and I'm
[49:04] really afraid to to press anything so um
[49:07] it's not gonna happen Robin it's not
[49:09] gonna happen technical people do not
[49:11] understand how non technical
[49:13] non-technical people are and so my very
[49:15] first when I understood what Bitcoin was
[49:18] I thought oh gosh I've got to bit some
[49:19] I've got to meet some more bitcoiners
[49:21] and so the very first conference I went
[49:23] to was the citadela in Switz land and I
[49:28] don't know if you know the Citadel so it
[49:30] meets one year in Switzerland one year
[49:31] in Austria one year in Germany and it's
[49:34] hard core and so there's me this little
[49:37] gray old gray-haired old lady I turn up
[49:39] in Switzerland and I walk in there and
[49:41] and it's all young developers and then I
[49:43] thought what am I doing here what am I
[49:46] doing here I had the best weekend of my
[49:48] life honestly I mean
[49:50] there they're friendly and and and
[49:53] they're welcoming wonderful but when I'm
[49:56] looking at the Pres
[49:57] presentations and they you know they're
[49:59] talking all the it's it's a foreign
[50:01] language to me and they say oh you just
[50:02] need to go and everything that they blah
[50:04] blah blah blah I haven't got a clue what
[50:06] they're talking about it's not going to
[50:08] happen and so when we doam of events we
[50:11] had our first one two years ago we got
[50:13] 70% women attending and what we do is
[50:17] you know we do workshops to really show
[50:20] them how to do it let's all sit down
[50:21] with our computers let's all sit down
[50:23] with our B bit box let's all sit down
[50:25] let's let's get some satosi
[50:27] let's send some lightning to each other
[50:30] hey that was easy wasn't it you don't
[50:31] have to understand anything about the
[50:33] lightning network but you can use it you
[50:35] don't understand anything about the
[50:36] engine of your car but you can use it
[50:38] you don't understand how your credit
[50:39] card works but you can use it so if you
[50:41] can teach them the basic rules of what
[50:43] they need to be safe and you do need to
[50:45] learn basic rules with Bitcoin how to
[50:47] look after your keys and and all the
[50:49] rest of it that's very important but you
[50:52] do not have to understand how it works
[50:54] beneath the Bonnet and once people
[50:56] understand that that you need to know
[50:58] how to use it safely then you'll find
[51:00] that they're much more prepared and if
[51:02] you've got somebody up on the stage
[51:03] who's just talking tech tech tech tech
[51:06] tech tech tech you will lose them and
[51:08] even a a big part of the M audience I I
[51:10] know in the beginning I was like what is
[51:12] that five minutes I was turning off like
[51:15] it's it's like if it's too much like if
[51:17] we hear five words we don't understand
[51:20] we we tend to like look at something
[51:22] different so I I really like to to bring
[51:24] something um easier to understand to
[51:27] bitcoin one topic that we discussed a
[51:29] little bit in the beginning that I want
[51:30] to get into uh is the adoption Bitcoin
[51:34] uh the Bitcoin adoption in Europe versus
[51:36] in the USA I have an English podcast so
[51:40] a lot of my guests are from the USA I
[51:42] know my audience is 50% from the USA and
[51:45] only 22% from the European Union Plus
[51:47] the UK uh so I know they are SK skewed
[51:52] towards the USA because yeah in in
[51:54] Europe we have all those different
[51:55] languages and they in German they prefer
[51:58] German things and stuff like that and
[52:00] when I talk to people I have always this
[52:02] feeling like all the Bitcoin adoption on
[52:05] a political level is always like oh
[52:06] Trump is making a Bitcoin transaction
[52:08] camela is doing this and like no he's
[52:11] not he didn't touch that phone you got
[52:14] clue but but but that's what we that's
[52:16] what we hear right like that's one the
[52:18] things uh that we hear and when I look
[52:21] at the political stage in Europe it
[52:23] seems quiet is that is that just like
[52:26] ception uh or do you do you think that
[52:29] the America or the United States of
[52:31] America is further ahead on the
[52:34] political level what Bitcoin adoption is
[52:37] going or is Europe is is Europe lagging
[52:40] in this in this
[52:42] regard yes Europe is lagging because
[52:46] there was a wonderful case uh there was
[52:48] a wonderful thing on LinkedIn that I saw
[52:49] yesterday that said America innovates
[52:53] China rep replicates
[52:56] Europe
[52:58] regulates and that's very very true so
[53:00] you I lived in America for a while and
[53:02] and what's wonderful about the American
[53:04] people is they view every failure as a
[53:07] success you know so you you just get on
[53:10] there you try it and if you fail you're
[53:11] not a loser you're a winner because
[53:14] you're trying and I think it's a
[53:16] different perception in in Europe if you
[53:17] tell people that you've had a business
[53:19] which has gone under they think you're a
[53:20] loser they'd rather not have a business
[53:22] at all they'd rather work for the
[53:23] government and and and safely get their
[53:25] money so yes America is definitely
[53:28] further ahead than we are in Europe
[53:31] however there is a lot going on behind
[53:33] the scenes or not even behind the scenes
[53:35] I mean we have the wonderful German
[53:37] politician Johanna kotar who started the
[53:40] initiative Bitcoin in
[53:42] bundestag um and I was privileged enough
[53:44] to be the part of the first party to go
[53:46] to there so um the CEO of terahash the
[53:50] company I work for Chris cler was
[53:52] talking there along with war mana and
[53:55] were there many politicians sitting in
[53:57] the circle no um but was it an amazing
[54:00] thing to have a great big Bitcoin logo
[54:02] and we took a Bitcoin miner so there's
[54:04] been a Bitcoin minor in the German
[54:07] Parliament we had it specially sent over
[54:10] and made just for that occasion um so
[54:14] politically we're slow or we're
[54:18] slower but what I love I mean you just
[54:22] need to look to Germany I love I love
[54:23] Germany and I love the Germans they
[54:26] they're Engineers the Germans are
[54:28] engineers and if you look at what's
[54:30] going on in lightning what what's
[54:32] happening with with there's so much
[54:34] going on in Germany where are all the
[54:35] nodes you know a lot of the nodes are in
[54:37] Germany so I think we're not as loud I
[54:41] mean the Americans like to be quite loud
[54:43] about things and and Shout things out
[54:44] from the stage but I feel that there's a
[54:47] lot going on particularly in the German
[54:50] speaking world I can't speak so much to
[54:52] the rest of Europe um we work together
[54:55] with with people from Holland I don't
[54:57] see an awful lot going on in France but
[54:59] I might be wrong on that I do see what's
[55:01] going on in England politically it's a
[55:02] disaster we work together with the UK
[55:04] policy um the people who were trying to
[55:07] do the same thing as IA yes we're
[55:10] further behind than America
[55:13] definitely however it's not all doom and
[55:16] gloom there's more going on than you
[55:18] think and the way that politics Works in
[55:22] Europe is behind closed doors and you
[55:24] need to you need to be talking talking
[55:26] to the right people and it takes time to
[55:28] get to the right people it's all about
[55:30] building trust um speaking the right
[55:33] language you know that you you use the
[55:36] words that they're used to hearing not
[55:38] going in there like a bull in the china
[55:40] shop with with your Bitcoin
[55:44] um apparel on on your hat and telling
[55:46] them that they're all useless and
[55:47] they're all corrupt that's not going to
[55:49] get you anywhere chip away little bit
[55:51] little bit little bit and and you know
[55:53] no of course Bitcoin doesn't need Europe
[55:57] of course Bitcoin doesn't need Europe
[55:59] but Europe does need Bitcoin and this is
[56:02] what we've slowly got to get into their
[56:03] heads and you know one one little
[56:06] meeting one little talk with with with
[56:09] serious companies I mean this is where
[56:12] terahash plays a massive role because
[56:14] we've been around for for 75 years we
[56:18] were built just after the second world
[56:19] war it was started off in the garage you
[56:22] know how these stories always happen and
[56:23] it's grown we've now there 300 employees
[56:26] we've got Works in noises we've got
[56:28] works in the in the east of Germany now
[56:31] when a company like that talks about the
[56:34] benefit of of Bitcoin mining the local
[56:37] politicians obviously not the national
[56:39] politicians because we're not yet unipa
[56:41] or semans or whatever but we're getting
[56:43] there we we're getting there with those
[56:45] companies so the more we can get the
[56:48] companies to
[56:50] understand how vital Bitcoin mining is
[56:54] if you then get the the like of uniper
[56:57] and Seamans and all of these big
[56:59] companies them going along to the
[57:02] politicians and saying we need this this
[57:05] is the regulation this is how the
[57:06] regulation needs to be then we've
[57:09] won then we've won but a a Bitcoin
[57:11] company who's a startup they're not
[57:14] going to have even though they're
[57:15] fantastic I'm not dismissing them
[57:17] they're fantastic they're the future but
[57:19] they're not going to be the ones to
[57:20] persuade politicians that they need to
[57:21] be listened to it has to be has to be
[57:25] the the really big taxpayers big
[57:28] companies yeah that's well they're not
[57:30] the taxpayers though are they that's the
[57:32] that's the thing that really annoys me
[57:34] the larger the company the less tax they
[57:37] pay it's actually your midsize companies
[57:39] that we're the idiots we're the ones who
[57:41] pay tax you know your big companies
[57:42] aren't paying tax but anyway that's a
[57:45] that's a whole other
[57:48] podcast we we we're closing down on the
[57:50] one hour mic let's let's not open this
[57:52] this
[57:54] topic um really cool uh as we are now on
[57:56] the end of the podcast I have one more
[57:58] question because I think you have an
[58:00] unique perspective on that um we talked
[58:02] a little bit about orange ping when
[58:05] someone actually comes to you and and
[58:06] asks you okay what what what is bitcoin
[58:08] and he he or she is a a no cor
[58:11] especially maybe also someone takes
[58:13] someone to Les Fage event and she knows
[58:15] nothing about uh Bitcoin how do you
[58:17] compare Bitcoin there are so many
[58:19] interesting comparisons that people make
[58:21] with Bitcoin to actually make it
[58:23] understandable because if you have no
[58:25] clue what Bitcoin is it's it's kind of
[58:26] hard to explain because there's nothing
[58:27] to really compare it to how do you make
[58:30] Bitcoin understandable and
[58:32] comparable what works with women and
[58:35] what works with the whole world is
[58:37] storytelling tell your story and tell
[58:40] them what what Bitcoin is for you we've
[58:43] got a wonderful film out with leam where
[58:46] um soy which is a regenerative um
[58:50] agriculture platform they were there and
[58:53] they did this wonderful film and they
[58:54] basically just went around and we do
[58:56] have men coming to leam of by the way
[58:58] and there's a there are men who love it
[59:00] because it's a much more collaborative
[59:02] atmosphere it's a much more gentle
[59:04] atmosphere and you'll find the men at
[59:05] the end saying oh that was wonderful I
[59:07] could just be you know I don't have to
[59:09] be the cleverest in the room or whatever
[59:11] and so they were going around and they
[59:12] were asking people what's Bitcoin for
[59:14] you and the majority of the answers were
[59:18] Freedom um hope optimism so all these
[59:24] words that come out this is what what
[59:26] you know obviously it's a it's a digital
[59:28] currency but I mean that's not going to
[59:29] get me excited I don't I don't
[59:31] understand what will I do but you know
[59:33] that doesn't get me excited but if I
[59:35] listen to somebody and they're telling
[59:38] me about their life and I can relate to
[59:40] that life because it's a life similar to
[59:42] mine and I know that I go to work um
[59:44] eight hours a day and and I work my
[59:47] socks off and I'm getting poorer and
[59:49] poorer and I don't know how I'm going to
[59:50] cope when I go onto a pension and those
[59:53] people are talking about a similar life
[59:55] and how they found this thing that they
[59:57] that has given them hope that's all I
[60:00] need to know that's all I need to know
[60:03] and then I am motivated to find out for
[60:06] myself and my one of my favorite books
[60:09] that I recommend in in the German
[60:11] language is di which was written by um J
[60:16] Mangal and he is a literary critic for
[60:18] the times and I love the way he writes
[60:21] his book you know there's because he's
[60:23] exactly well he's he's an extremely
[60:25] intelligent guy but he's not a technical
[60:27] guy and so he's written this book in a
[60:29] way of I don't understand this why have
[60:32] I fallen so madly in love with Bitcoin
[60:33] I'm not interested in money I'm not
[60:35] interested in in in technology yet I
[60:37] love this Bitcoin and so that is a
[60:39] fantastic book so you have to look at
[60:41] who you're talking to if you're talking
[60:42] to somebody who is mathematical
[60:45] Financial technical then then yeah give
[60:47] them the books that explain you know
[60:49] mastering Bitcoin mastering lightning
[60:52] get all the all those Andreas
[60:53] antinopolis books and if it's some body
[60:56] who's more like me more of a social
[60:58] person give them the Alex gladstein give
[61:01] them you know give give them the
[61:02] storytelling books of why Bitcoin is
[61:06] good and that's you know they don't need
[61:08] to understand it's it's money and then
[61:11] you first what's money and then you
[61:13] realize that you don't understand what
[61:14] money is and then you start I mean you
[61:16] know this and you start questioning
[61:18] absolutely everything but then they're
[61:20] on the journey by themselves and you
[61:22] don't need to do anything because
[61:23] they'll they'll find their way down one
[61:26] rabbit hole into the next rabbit hole
[61:28] and it's really funny because you can
[61:29] just see us all all of us on this most
[61:33] amazing journey we're all on most we''re
[61:36] all changing more profound 54 you would
[61:40] have thought you could change that much
[61:41] when you fit profound
[61:44] changes and that's what every Bitcoin is
[61:46] on really really how did you change uh
[61:49] as I don't know you before Bitcoin how
[61:52] how was how was that training for you I
[61:54] think I would say that my values haven't
[61:57] changed I've always been very family
[61:59] oriented I've always you know loved
[62:01] nature not spent enough time in nature
[62:03] but what I've really changed is how I
[62:06] think Solutions can happen and you know
[62:09] I used to be very I I'm not saying that
[62:11] you don't need government and you don't
[62:12] need you know I think I think it's it's
[62:15] you need rules you need rules definitely
[62:18] I know that as a mother of a family
[62:19] without rules nothing happens but the
[62:22] same rules have got to apply to every
[62:24] single member so there was no I couldn't
[62:26] say to my children don't eat sweets and
[62:28] then I stuff myself with sweets they're
[62:30] not going to listen to me and we've got
[62:32] the problem at the moment that the the
[62:34] the system that we've got there's one
[62:36] rules for thee and there's another rule
[62:38] for me and that's no good that's no good
[62:42] so and that's the beauty of Bitcoin it's
[62:45] rules without rulers you know so
[62:47] everybody has to stick to the same rules
[62:49] so I I've I think that we need to get
[62:53] decent more decentralized again
[62:56] I think it's I'm responsible for myself
[62:58] and I'm responsible for my children no
[63:00] one's coming to save me nobody is coming
[63:03] to save me so I need to make sure that
[63:05] I've got everything in place that I need
[63:07] and that my children need whereas before
[63:09] you think about oh well you know there's
[63:11] the pensions there's the social welfare
[63:13] I think this has all done us a lot of
[63:15] harm I think that the health system has
[63:18] done us a lot of harm because you then
[63:21] you don't take responsibility for
[63:23] yourself and look after your own health
[63:25] if you look at the Obesity levels you
[63:27] know people get really fat and then they
[63:29] get a hip operation now if they had to
[63:32] pay that hip operation by themselves
[63:34] they would make damn sure that they
[63:35] don't get so fat or take the social
[63:39] services if I hear the child screaming
[63:42] next door screaming screaming screaming
[63:44] what do people do they ring the the
[63:47] social services and they say there's a
[63:49] child screaming next door what would be
[63:51] better that I knock on the door and I
[63:53] say to that woman who's probably
[63:55] exhausting did and over challenged do
[63:57] you want me to take your child for an
[63:58] hour two hours can I bring you a meal
[64:01] can I help you and so with this whole
[64:04] social State we have stopped relying on
[64:08] our own families and on our neighbors
[64:10] and on our neighborhood and on our
[64:12] society and we rely on these
[64:15] bureaucrats sitting somewhere miles away
[64:18] from us who've got no idea what's going
[64:20] on in our life and so what what I
[64:23] believe is we have to get back to the
[64:27] small and I as you know the families
[64:31] need to decide what's right for the
[64:32] families and the neighbors need to
[64:34] decide what's right for the neighbors
[64:36] and and that's where you need the rules
[64:38] and regulations in place for small areas
[64:42] you know you can't be having people
[64:43] deciding hundreds of kilometers away to
[64:47] take the pandemic you know the pandemic
[64:50] was a massive eye opener for me and I
[64:51] was I was a very
[64:54] very um following all the rules at the
[64:56] beginning and thinking oh this is what I
[64:58] need to do until I saw how ridiculous
[65:01] the rules were and that happened because
[65:04] I was going to pick up my son-in-law
[65:06] from the airport he was flying in from
[65:08] London to Munich so I go to the airport
[65:12] to pick him up and I'm waiting outside
[65:15] and all of the Germans come out and they
[65:17] greet their families they cuddle their
[65:19] families and off they go and there's no
[65:21] no Max no Max no Max and when I finally
[65:24] work out what's happened they kept all
[65:26] of the foreigners and they kept them
[65:29] overnight under police surveillance at
[65:31] the airport sleeping on Camp beds until
[65:33] the next morning when they could be
[65:35] tested and then if they were negative
[65:36] they could go out and I thought but it's
[65:39] a virus and you've just let all those
[65:40] Germans into the country and the virus
[65:42] doesn't know whether I'm German or
[65:44] Russian and then it was just for me that
[65:46] was just a this is a load of bollocks
[65:48] you know they've got no idea excuse my
[65:50] language they've got no idea what
[65:52] they're doing it's just these rules all
[65:54] over the place maybe they mean well with
[65:56] them I don't know I don't want to
[65:57] comment on that but whatever it is
[65:59] they're stupid rules and so I need to
[66:01] set the rules that are sensible for my
[66:03] for my environment don't tell me I can
[66:05] have five people at Christmas when I've
[66:07] got four children yeah I will decide
[66:09] that I can have all of my children
[66:11] sitting around the table and so this is
[66:14] this is we need far less rules and this
[66:17] is another thing I learned as a mom
[66:18] don't have many rules but the rules that
[66:21] you have people have to stick to them
[66:24] and then it you know and you feel the
[66:26] consequences you don't get punished if
[66:28] you don't stick to the rules but you
[66:29] feel the consequences of you not
[66:31] sticking to the rules what we've got at
[66:33] the moment is there's no accountability
[66:35] it doesn't matter what what decisions
[66:37] are made at a political level nobody has
[66:40] to take a accountability for the
[66:42] decisions that they make they just leave
[66:44] at the end of their fouryear and then
[66:46] they go and get enormously well-paid
[66:49] speaking events and it doesn't matter
[66:51] what they've left behind them this has
[66:53] got to stop we need people people who
[66:55] are making decisions have to take
[66:57] accountability for the decisions that
[66:59] they make and then I'm all for leaders
[67:01] you can be my leader if if you really
[67:03] you're out the font if you want to have
[67:05] a war you send your children into that
[67:08] war you send your children first and
[67:10] then I might consider sending my
[67:11] children afterwards but don't send my
[67:13] children to war when you're not going to
[67:15] war you know this is how this is how
[67:16] I've changed that that's beautiful
[67:19] that's a that's a beautiful segment
[67:20] thank you so much for that um we have
[67:22] tin uh the first tin question is always
[67:25] a same question for every guest uh and
[67:28] the question is what can we learn from
[67:30] you besides uh Bitcoin and all the
[67:32] things that we already talked about
[67:33] something about myself yeah whatever you
[67:35] want to to share either a learning or
[67:39] something about yourself or I leave it
[67:42] open open to you how you want to answer
[67:44] that I think it's important to remember
[67:47] Bitcoin is not
[67:48] everything and you've got one life and
[67:51] live that life and a life without love
[67:54] is a pointless
[67:56] a pointless life you know you need you
[67:58] need a roof over your head you need
[68:00] something to eat you need something to
[68:02] drink and you need love and we're all so
[68:04] busy running around running around
[68:07] trying to find Solutions but I might be
[68:09] dead tomorrow and so I want to make sure
[68:12] that I have got those things in my life
[68:14] and they will be always more important
[68:16] to me than I love that a lot really cool
[68:20] um we have an end in the podcast where
[68:22] the previous guest is asking also a
[68:23] question for the next guest without
[68:24] knowing who the next guest is uh this is
[68:26] a a short one I guess did you already
[68:29] created or visited a local Bitcoin
[68:31] Meetup where you uh
[68:34] live yes of course I I my first we've
[68:38] got IM Munich we don't have an Anon
[68:39] swans stsh but we've got a similar stsh
[68:42] and I I used to go along to that now we
[68:46] have two
[68:47] leam uh meetups in Munich so there's one
[68:50] in paring and there's one in the cuff
[68:52] but leam orang is growing we're getting
[68:54] we're getting and we're modeled on I and
[68:57] swanic I love IR and swansig I think
[68:59] they're fantastic um and so we've
[69:01] actually created our own meetups because
[69:04] people want to meet up with with
[69:06] likeminded people and you know I used to
[69:09] love going to those those stsh with Ian
[69:11] spaning but the man next to me would be
[69:13] showing me his latest Hardware wallet or
[69:15] something and I
[69:17] would and you know it's fine it's
[69:20] interesting for him it's not interesting
[69:21] for me and what interests me doesn't
[69:22] interest him it's fine but that's the
[69:24] way it is yes I go to I go to as much as
[69:27] I can um but of course now because it's
[69:30] my full life you know I'm I live and
[69:33] breathe Bitcoin and my I'm going less
[69:36] and less it's it's too exhausting and
[69:38] I've got four children and they they
[69:39] need their mom even though they adult
[69:41] they need them mom thank you so much
