[00:00] they don't want the financial system
[00:01] piling into Bitcoin you know so they've
[00:03] made it restrictive so the ETF is a very
[00:05] dangerous tool if a regulator doesn't
[00:07] like the asset that it of represents
[00:09] because suddenly trillions can go into
[00:11] that asset yeah people have been you
[00:13] know I think the whole the whole system
[00:14] has been looking for quick fixes Simple
[00:16] Solutions and so the easiest thing to do
[00:18] is to buy the biggest most liquid asset
[00:19] classes yeah I think it's been good
[00:21] steady progress I mean I I came across
[00:23] Bitcoin in um 2013 I watched the
[00:26] breakout from $100 I didn't own any I
[00:28] didn't know how to buy it but I watched
[00:29] the breakout I was asking people who
[00:31] knows about Bitcoin and no one knew
[00:33] anything the central banks are active in
[00:35] the gold market and have been forever I
[00:37] don't think they would be in the you
[00:38] know Western central banks in the late
[00:40] 1990s were very happy to get rid of all
[00:42] their gold they thought it was useless
[00:44] and if you fire an active manager and
[00:46] buy an index fund guess what they sell
[00:48] all their small midcap stocks and then
[00:50] they put all the money into the largest
[00:52] stocks no active manager in the world is
[00:54] overweight the largest stocks Bitcoin
[00:56] becomes bigger and stronger every time
[01:00] [Music]
[01:03] we have uh the interesting toping about
[01:06] bold I like that uh that that uh
[01:09] marketing term of like Bitcoin and gold
[01:11] um but before we get into the charts and
[01:13] and all the things that you've prepared
[01:15] um maybe a little bit about Bitcoin
[01:17] because the last time we spoke was
[01:19] January last year and there has been so
[01:22] much happening between with the ETFs uh
[01:24] with the Strategic Bitcoin reserve of
[01:26] trump uh and so much other things um how
[01:30] has Bitcoin evolved for you in the in
[01:32] the last couple of of months and the
[01:34] last year basically yeah I think it's
[01:37] been good steady progress I mean I I
[01:39] came across Bitcoin in um 2013 I watched
[01:42] the breakout from $100 I didn't own any
[01:44] I didn't know how to buy it but I
[01:46] watched the breakout I was asking people
[01:49] who knows about Bitcoin and no one knew
[01:50] anything uh but eventually I managed to
[01:53] find some people and start learning and
[01:55] and my journey began um but I think the
[01:59] what I've not that every few years or
[02:01] every cycle call it what you
[02:03] will the uh Bitcoin becomes bigger and
[02:06] stronger every time and so these last
[02:08] couple of years this cycle hasn't
[02:10] disappointed you know we've had the the
[02:12] US ETFs which are a positive force when
[02:15] money's coming in but they're are
[02:16] negative Force where money's coming out
[02:18] right but the fact we have them huge
[02:20] amounts of money has come in something
[02:22] like $50 billion this year or I forget
[02:25] the number but a big number has come
[02:26] into the to the network through the ETF
[02:29] and and that complements the European
[02:31] ETFs the ETFs in you know Brazil
[02:33] Australia Hong Kong Canada all of these
[02:37] things um and then we've had the first
[02:40] genuine major country discuss it um you
[02:44] know with Trump and the treasury as you
[02:46] just mentioned and it is that's really
[02:48] interesting because we've had El
[02:49] Salvador and other small places uh talk
[02:52] about it but no one's taking it
[02:54] seriously the only time you hear about
[02:56] Bitcoin in High Finance circles is the
[02:59] IMF writing something rude um or the
[03:01] bank for international settlements
[03:03] writing something saying how it's just
[03:05] it's just nonsense and doesn't work and
[03:08] of course they're all
[03:09] wrong and and it's not really the banks
[03:11] VI it's just a paper that came out of
[03:13] that that bank and it's one opinion but
[03:16] I think the fact that us is taking it
[03:17] seriously it's just shaking up so many
[03:19] things in so many places and um and I
[03:22] think it's been a positive of Bitcoin
[03:25] but you know Robin you know he Trump
[03:27] came in in November everything went up
[03:29] not just crypto but the NASDAQ and other
[03:31] stocks uh and now they're coming down
[03:34] and Bitcoin has always been correlated
[03:36] with the NASDAQ and tech stocks and all
[03:38] the time I've been watching it there
[03:40] used to be more social media stocks than
[03:41] Tech more recently in the last few years
[03:44] has become more General Tech you know
[03:46] microchips and so forth but it used to
[03:48] be very much a social media stock um but
[03:51] I think there's only one social media
[03:53] stock in the world really and that's
[03:54] matter isn't it it bought all the
[03:56] competitions but basically um you know
[03:59] Bitcoin is a product of the internet and
[04:01] so it's no great surprise that it
[04:03] correlates with the
[04:05] internet do you think the uh correlation
[04:08] between Bitcoin and the high tech stocks
[04:13] uh will will at some point break I've
[04:16] been hoping that for years and it hasn't
[04:19] broken it has never broken I was my
[04:22] thesis has always been that what's going
[04:23] to happen is that the tech bubble blows
[04:25] up and Bitcoin carries on that has been
[04:27] my hope and I still hope that's what's
[04:30] going to happen yeah but it hasn't
[04:32] happened yet the tech bubble is
[04:34] interesting because like we had already
[04:35] the bubble in 2000 is is that a is that
[04:40] a continuation of the same thing that
[04:42] you're seeing the same bubble basically
[04:44] or is this something new right now I
[04:46] mean has has little to do with Bitcoin
[04:48] but is the thing that You' have seen
[04:50] 2000 similar to what you see now with
[04:54] with uh tech stocks or is that very
[04:57] different so the thing about bubbles is
[04:59] people tend to blame one thing like the
[05:01] big SE or something but actually the
[05:03] bubbles everywhere you know it might
[05:05] show up in house prices in certain
[05:07] places it might show up in other Equity
[05:10] sectors it might show up in certain Bond
[05:12] sectors it might show up in the orchard
[05:14] rooms for Fine Art and so you know when
[05:16] there's a lot of money about many many
[05:18] different things go up and in the late
[05:20] 90s of course Tech was in the lead but
[05:23] many other sectors were also caught up
[05:25] in it and um and there were lots of
[05:28] corporate scandals in 200 1 2002 there
[05:31] were nothing to do with the internet you
[05:33] know so those stocks were already down a
[05:34] lot but there were other Corporal
[05:36] scandals and this time you know you've
[05:38] got the whole private Equity space which
[05:39] is huge and no one really knows what's
[05:42] going on there and um and then you've
[05:45] got um all sorts of U excessive
[05:50] excessive government spending which is
[05:52] now being cut but it's so big that we
[05:54] wonder how we're ever going to get on
[05:56] top of it um and then you've just got
[05:58] other other other sort of hot parts of
[06:00] the market so for example a stock like
[06:02] McDonald's trades you know that sells
[06:04] Burgers there's no microchips anywhere
[06:06] um it's just burgers and it's the
[06:08] highest valuation has ever traded at in
[06:10] its
[06:12] history yeah those P ratios get get out
[06:16] of it's it's for me the the the cause of
[06:20] those bubbles are I I I usually just
[06:22] like cheap money and money Printing and
[06:25] and too much into the in the system is
[06:28] is that uh only our real cause of of
[06:32] those bubbles occurring or is there
[06:33] something else also there's always lots
[06:35] of different things we always look for
[06:37] simple simple answers to questions but
[06:39] but there are lots and lots of um of
[06:41] things going on there's been lots of
[06:43] money Creation in the last five years
[06:44] but even before the pandemic you know
[06:46] people were still saying that these
[06:48] stocks were a bubble and um and so it's
[06:51] it's an old story that they've been
[06:52] highly valued but it's also the the
[06:55] consequence of indexation and after the
[06:58] financial crisis in 200 8 index funds
[07:01] became much more popular than ever they
[07:02] were quite popular in the 1990s but
[07:04] became even more popular since 2008 and
[07:07] they're now so big I think it's 8
[07:09] trillion dollar or something of of money
[07:12] in index funds and if you fire an active
[07:15] manager and buy an index fund yeah guess
[07:18] what they sell all their small midcap
[07:20] stocks and they put all the money into
[07:22] the largest stocks right no active
[07:25] manager in the world is overweight the
[07:26] largest
[07:27] stocks you think about it it's very
[07:29] simple maths right no one has got you
[07:32] know more Apple than the index and more
[07:34] Nvidia and more um Google and stuff like
[07:37] that so any active manager is going to
[07:40] be going no the opportunity is not out
[07:42] not up there it's down here it's the all
[07:44] this stuff that's cheap and small and
[07:46] mid and new and fast growing so they own
[07:49] all that stuff um and basically the the
[07:52] capital has gone away from um being
[07:55] spread far and wide in the economy and
[07:57] concentrated in the world's largest
[07:59] companies
[08:00] it's a strange situation you wouldn't
[08:01] make it that way you wouldn't you even
[08:03] though all the individual arguments like
[08:05] indexation is low cost simple Etc um the
[08:09] consequence of lots of logical thinking
[08:11] has created the biggest bubble in
[08:12] history of the world yeah and it's it's
[08:14] it's crazy how people misuse it as
[08:17] savings Technologies they they just buy
[08:20] the ETFs and the stocks as as a savings
[08:23] vehicle um but it's logical they they
[08:25] have to use something because they they
[08:27] cannot use the the Euro or the dollars
[08:29] so they they they flee in something else
[08:31] and my hope is that they come more and
[08:33] more into Bitcoin but it it takes some
[08:36] time till till this actually gets it's
[08:39] also the correlation I think uh is is
[08:42] also there because Bitcoin is uh
[08:45] comparatively still in the same uh
[08:48] bucket size as an apple or as a as an
[08:51] Google or Microsoft from market cap uh
[08:54] perspective it's a far range to to go
[08:58] still I think like I don't know 10x or
[09:00] 15x some something along those lines um
[09:03] where where that needs to go uh and then
[09:05] there's like volatility and all those
[09:07] things uh so it's probably also because
[09:10] it's it's just too small to to break
[09:12] that correlation I guess and too
[09:15] early yeah I mean if we think about um
[09:18] Bitcoin being a two trillion dollar
[09:20] asset probably isn't anymore after the
[09:22] fall but you know something like that um
[09:25] and the world is500 trillion dollars of
[09:27] um of assets of you know bonds equity
[09:31] and real estate and there some other
[09:32] things as well obviously gold is 20
[09:34] trillion Bitcoin
[09:36] to and a bit of other stuff you know
[09:38] even the license place of value art on
[09:41] the walls you know you add it all
[09:42] together it all counts and um yeah
[09:46] people have been you know I think the
[09:47] whole the whole system has been looking
[09:48] for quick fixes Simple Solutions and so
[09:51] the easiest thing to do is to buy the
[09:52] biggest most liquid asset classes where
[09:54] do you see Bitcoin actually going long
[09:56] term uh when we now even seeing
[09:58] governments having strategic Bitcoin
[10:00] reserves um do you foresee also central
[10:03] banks using it as a as a hatch and and
[10:06] and and buying it not yet but maybe one
[10:09] day it's possible but central banks are
[10:11] active in the gold market and have been
[10:13] forever I don't think they would be in
[10:16] the you know Western central banks in
[10:17] the late 1990s were very happy to get
[10:20] rid of all their gold they thought it
[10:21] was useless but then since that time
[10:24] since the late 90s the price of gold has
[10:25] been rising a lot yeah and it's up you
[10:28] know more than 10 times okay that's
[10:29] nothing for Bitcoin but you know this
[10:31] gold it's a 5,000 year old asset it's up
[10:34] more than the S&P 500 this Century
[10:36] including dividends yeah so Gold's done
[10:38] very well in the last 25 years and the
[10:41] Western central banks still aren't
[10:42] talking about it I mean the US has just
[10:45] decided to do an audit of four KNX right
[10:47] but no one else has I mean no one in
[10:49] Europe or Japan is talking about gold
[10:52] but in the non oecd countries you China
[10:56] um and and the Middle East um and of the
[10:59] Asian countries and African countries
[11:01] and Latin American they've been
[11:03] accumulating goldl since 2009 and no one
[11:06] told them to you know so they're very
[11:08] interested in having Diversified
[11:10] alternative assets but they haven't yet
[11:13] selected Bitcoin um I think if the us
[11:16] kicked off and actually did have a
[11:17] formal Reserve then other people would
[11:20] start thinking about it but there's a
[11:21] long way to go because for example in
[11:23] the UK you know the Bitcoin ETF is still
[11:26] banned for retail investors so it would
[11:28] be weird for the Central Bank to own
[11:31] Bitcoin but then the people were not
[11:32] allowed to own it wait in the UK you
[11:35] cannot have the the the Bitcoin ETF no
[11:38] interest I didn't do that interesting
[11:40] but you can hold Bitcoin in itself right
[11:43] you could own Bitcoin but I think the
[11:45] reason they've done this is because they
[11:46] want people to own it in small
[11:47] quantities they don't want the financial
[11:50] system piling into Bitcoin you know so
[11:52] they've made it restriced so the ETF is
[11:54] a very dangerous tool for if a regulator
[11:57] doesn't like the asset that it off
[11:58] represents
[11:59] is a dangerous tool because suddenly
[12:01] trillions can go into that asset easily
[12:04] yeah so by making a block and saying
[12:07] okay you can have an ETF listed in
[12:08] Switzerland uh or Germany like like I do
[12:11] with my Bitcoin and gold bold um you can
[12:14] have this product but we're going to
[12:16] prevent people from buying it yeah in
[12:19] our country so that makes it difficult
[12:21] for it to grow and and it means from
[12:23] their perspective U these things can
[12:25] never get out of control if if that's
[12:27] the regulatory objective now they they
[12:30] haven't they don't they don't have a
[12:31] problem with you buying Nvidia they
[12:33] don't have a problem with you buying
[12:35] gold or bonds or anything uh just
[12:37] Bitcoin and crypto then what what they
[12:41] are essentially doing is just uh cutting
[12:44] themselves off of Bitcoin because uh
[12:46] Bitcoin ETFs in in America flowing and
[12:49] uh in in Europe they're flowing in in
[12:51] other countries they're flowing uh so
[12:53] they just basically restricted their own
[12:57] economic uh Power in in
[12:59] that way from what Robin I'm not
[13:01] sticking out for Regulators I don't
[13:03] agree with what they're doing but I just
[13:04] tell you what's happening and and it's
[13:06] Europe is not free on bitcoin so there
[13:08] are some countries that are more free
[13:10] right like Switzerland Germany but then
[13:12] other countries are quite you know well
[13:14] Finland until recently been quite
[13:16] restrictive Portugal Spain Spain more so
[13:19] was quite restrictive Ireland was
[13:21] restrictive and and a lot of them were
[13:23] confused I mean Sweden was the first one
[13:25] to allow the ETF and then they then they
[13:28] sort of sort of almost didn't realize
[13:30] they had done it in 2015 and so there
[13:32] was some lots of surprises I think
[13:34] everyone's looking around wondering what
[13:35] the hell this thing is and it came from
[13:37] nowhere it took Regulators by surprise
[13:40] but for example you know UBS in UBS in
[13:44] Switzerland okay big Swiss bank um
[13:47] Bitcoin is banned so so no one in UBS no
[13:50] private Banker in UBS will take an order
[13:52] for a Bitcoin easier and the same is all
[13:55] the big bank they weren't
[13:57] trading well um but from what I
[14:00] understand the the own micro strategy
[14:02] the central Swiss uh National Bank has I
[14:06] I don't know it's it has been some
[14:09] months that I read that and I did not
[14:11] investigate further but I think they own
[14:14] a portion of of micro strategy somehow
[14:18] uh which which is with funny I don't
[14:19] know if it's it's actually true maybe
[14:21] it's just because of the of the NASDAQ
[14:23] 100 also an indirect exposure more
[14:25] likely they would just own the NASDAQ
[14:27] and then therefore they have some mic
[14:29] but you know micro strategy I mean I'm
[14:31] not a fan of micro strategy I me you may
[14:34] well be um but it's a regulatory
[14:36] Arbitrage because so so so many people
[14:39] can't buy ETFs in Bitcoin even in the US
[14:42] a lot of platforms restrict Bitcoin ETFs
[14:44] yeah even though the law says you can
[14:46] the Vanguard platform I think the meril
[14:48] Lynch I'm not quite sure exactly but the
[14:51] Vanguard platform doesn't allow Bitcoin
[14:53] ETF to be traded and and and so you know
[14:56] large amounts of the American Financial
[14:58] system have block it and the private
[15:00] Banks and the discretionary wealth
[15:02] managers a lot of them will not play so
[15:04] if you look at who owns the I shares
[15:06] Bitcoin ETF it is not your typical
[15:09] wealth manager it's hedge funds and
[15:11] family offices and these kind of people
[15:14] so it's it's wrong to say that bitcoin's
[15:16] out there free in the financial system
[15:19] um most most places have what either
[15:21] banned it or Shadow band it so for
[15:24] example you can't trade the Bitcoin ETFs
[15:25] as I said UK you can't trade them in
[15:27] Japan you can't trade them in Singapore
[15:29] you can't trade them in Thailand you
[15:32] know the list is quite long then it's
[15:34] interesting that the the Bitcoin atdf is
[15:36] still so successful like it's a it's a
[15:39] huge huge amount of influ even though
[15:43] vard I remember it was a huge news story
[15:46] of like oh like uh we're not doing and
[15:49] then you saw all the Bitcoin as are uh
[15:52] screenshotting their um Bank changes
[15:55] from vaner to something else and stuff
[15:57] like that I remember that in Twitter
[15:59] uh but it's it's interesting how what
[16:02] wasn't it the the biggest uh inflow of
[16:06] of any ETF uh from from black roog you
[16:10] probably know that better than me yeah
[16:11] yeah it was huge the numbers were
[16:13] record-breaking um but the reason to be
[16:15] bullish Bitcoin is because of this
[16:17] argument because you as you say it's
[16:20] achieved a lot $2 trillion dollar asset
[16:22] class on the back of mainly retail money
[16:25] for the certainly for the first 14 years
[16:27] yeah and small small amounts of European
[16:29] ETF and grayscale of course grayscale
[16:32] gbtc played a very strong role before
[16:35] 2020 um so there were there were there
[16:38] were roots to Market uh for
[16:39] institutional money but there were fewer
[16:42] and the the bull argument for Bitcoin
[16:44] from here in my opinion is that uh the
[16:47] global wealth management industry is
[16:49] roughly a quarter of all the assets
[16:51] remember I said the assets were 500
[16:52] trillion so their quarters 125 trillion
[16:56] yeah their allocation to bitcoin is
[16:58] approxim
[17:00] zero now they earn some gold but they
[17:02] don't ear any Bitcoin they they ear
[17:04] maybe one or 2% gold but they don't ear
[17:06] any Bitcoin so all you have to think
[17:09] about is is that changing and so you
[17:12] know maybe won't happen this year won't
[17:13] happen next year but at some point in
[17:16] the future it will change and when it
[17:18] changes um then there's there's
[17:21] continued large inflows into the Bitcoin
[17:24] ecosystem just like we saw in 2024 with
[17:27] I shares and fidelity
[17:29] and 21 shares these firms um put lots
[17:33] and lots of money into the ecosystem and
[17:35] then we'll just
[17:36] continue and I don't think it's going to
[17:38] be an overnight event I think it's going
[17:39] to be a series of small events you this
[17:42] country relaxes the rules that country
[17:45] relaxes the rules this firm gets
[17:47] interested um this sort of thing
[17:50] interesting uh quickly on on the on the
[17:53] note of Mount G that that was super
[17:55] funny uh to see that uh what do you
[17:58] expect happening from the the audit that
[18:01] might hopefully happen at some point
[18:03] what on Mount
[18:04] go yeah the mount go AIT I think El uh
[18:08] was was posting about it and now they
[18:10] might actually do it do you mean Fort KN
[18:12] oh Fort KN s sorry not mon Al to
[18:16] exchange 2013 Japan this and Fort KNX is
[18:20] um the James Bond film Goldfinger
[18:23] and yeah I mean I think the Gold's there
[18:26] and I and I I personally don't believe
[18:29] there's um there's a problem in the gold
[18:31] market but lots of people do and I think
[18:33] they always will one of the reasons why
[18:35] is because Gold's so simple it's the one
[18:38] reason the one one of the reasons where
[18:40] where Bitcoin is vastly superior to gold
[18:42] is on the
[18:43] transferability you know we recently saw
[18:46] uh people taking gold from London to New
[18:48] York and of course you know what that
[18:50] means is three men in boiler suits go to
[18:52] the vaults they count the they take the
[18:55] bars they polish them they send them to
[18:57] Switzerland for refine for a new shapee
[18:59] and then they send them to America it's
[19:01] a crazy process whereas in
[19:05] Bitcoin very simple um but then other
[19:08] people say okay what goal's physical I
[19:11] like the physicality some people don't
[19:13] some think it doesn't matter and then
[19:15] you've got things like you know the
[19:17] Bitcoin network uh you need the miners
[19:19] to run it whereas in the gold in the
[19:21] gold ecosystem you just mine it once and
[19:23] then there's no power consumption
[19:25] afterwards and so there there are
[19:27] different views and and I come back to
[19:29] it and say it's not a matter of Better
[19:30] or Worse they're just
[19:32] different yeah the only thing they have
[19:35] in common is the supply side equation
[19:37] yeah where Bitcoin and actually
[19:38] bitcoin's inflation rate now is lower
[19:40] than Golds
[19:42] but so what they both have a very high
[19:45] stock to flow ratio and so that that's
[19:47] important that makes them um scarce
[19:50] assets they're both highly liquid assets
[19:52] so they're both good uh for a store
[19:55] long-term store value that's interesting
[19:58] it's a very interesting perspective
[20:00] because a lot of people compare Bitcoin
[20:02] and gold all the time uh and if actually
[20:06] if you look at it uh they don't have I
[20:09] mean the characteristics the the the
[20:12] properties uh if you look at that they
[20:14] there might be some
[20:16] similarities uh but but even there uh
[20:19] even from a supply Supply like gold as
[20:22] continuous Supply Bitcoin it's it's it's
[20:24] just not not not scarce it's limited
[20:26] like there's just a cap that that will
[20:28] be reached one day and you can even make
[20:30] the argument that we're just going down
[20:33] and Supply because people keep losing it
[20:36] uh and and doing that so uh and then
[20:38] it's the one is digital uh and the other
[20:41] one is is physical so there's actually a
[20:43] lot of differences but I think because
[20:47] of the continuation and people also
[20:49] calling it the digital gold uh and and
[20:52] that narrative just brings them so close
[20:55] together and even seen as a as in comp
[20:58] competitor uh and I don't know like if
[21:02] if you see for me uh real estate and and
[21:06] ETFs all those index fonts and the
[21:10] savings vehicles that that's a bigger uh
[21:13] that's a bigger competitor for for
[21:15] Bitcoin I feel like if if there's a
[21:17] competitor because I don't know if
[21:19] there's no second Bitcoin for me so
[21:21] there's not really a competitor but they
[21:23] compete for different Financial energies
[21:27] uh and uh what also don't like in in
[21:31] Gold versus Bitcoin debates is like gold
[21:34] bucks is like people that don't like
[21:36] Bitcoin and only like gold and
[21:38] bitcoiners that only like Bitcoin and
[21:40] don't like gold both are kind of in the
[21:42] same team they rooting for the same
[21:45] thing they they just have a slightly
[21:48] different solution but overall they
[21:51] agree on like 99% of this problem 99% of
[21:56] the how they look at the financial
[21:57] markets just that he likes gold and he
[22:00] likes Bitcoin and that that's how Mo
[22:02] most Bitcoin versus gold debates are and
[22:04] I told you that before we started the
[22:06] podcast I actually never like I thought
[22:09] that Bitcoin is a scam and gold is
[22:11] useless before I was orange build and
[22:13] then I got orange build actually with a
[22:15] gold versus Bitcoin debate and through
[22:17] Bitcoin I actually got to understand and
[22:21] appreciate the value of gold without
[22:23] Bitcoin I probably would never have
[22:25] looked at gold which is an interesting
[22:27] thought of not only gold brings people
[22:30] to bitcoin but also Bitcoin brings kind
[22:32] of people to to that gold narrative I
[22:34] don't know if you have thoughts on that
[22:36] yeah I mean there's a lot to say I mean
[22:39] you rightly say that all assets are in
[22:41] competition in some extent of course
[22:43] because I have a $100 I want to invest
[22:46] it and I want to put $2 into real estate
[22:48] and $5 into gold and how much in Bitcoin
[22:51] and and we make these decisions so to to
[22:54] some extent that is correct SSR in
[22:57] competition but I think we can segregate
[22:59] the assets and um you've got equities
[23:02] and bonds and real estate which are to
[23:04] my mind are Financial assets all right
[23:07] it's all about Fiat money yeah they're
[23:10] in business to to pay out dividends
[23:12] income streams in Fiat money yeah
[23:14] Bitcoin and gold are alternative
[23:17] assets and they're the world's two most
[23:19] liquid alternative assets so what else
[23:21] so you've got Bitcoin and digital and
[23:23] you've got all the other stuff ethereum
[23:25] and salana and its friends and then
[23:28] you've got in Commodities you have gold
[23:31] and then you have um the other precious
[23:33] metals the silver is you know silver and
[23:35] ethereum are quite similar in the sense
[23:37] that um ethereum is more volatile than
[23:41] Bitcoin um and it's less liquid silver
[23:44] is more volatile than gold and it's less
[23:46] liquid yeah so you know you can own gold
[23:50] and you have more liquidity and less
[23:52] volatility you can earn Bitcoin and have
[23:55] less volatility and more liquidity than
[23:57] if you earn ethereum
[23:58] okay so the number twos are not as
[24:00] strong in terms of quality of the asset
[24:03] in either liquidity or volatility then
[24:05] we've got other things so we've got uh
[24:07] copper and oil oil of course is a very
[24:10] liquid Market but you can't physically
[24:12] store large amounts of oil there's also
[24:14] got a terrible stock to flow ratio um
[24:17] because we consume it and the same with
[24:19] agriculture um then you've got other
[24:21] alternative assets such as art and wine
[24:25] and and sports cars and collectibles uh
[24:28] but these are not liquid assets and so
[24:30] when you break it down and think about
[24:31] all the possibilities in in the world of
[24:33] alternative assets things that don't
[24:36] hash cash flow yeah they do not have the
[24:38] cash flow then um Bitcoin and gold are
[24:42] the two most liquid um alternative
[24:45] Assets in the world are there any
[24:48] other think I mean yes there's like arts
[24:50] and and yeah you mentioned it like an an
[24:53] art and and stuff like that that also
[24:55] has no cash flow and as like but Bitcoin
[24:57] and gold is the the only big ones that
[25:00] are liquid and uh available in in big
[25:02] quantities yeah that's like that's an
[25:04] interesting point of like uh dividing it
[25:08] with like Financial assets and and those
[25:10] who where there's like no cash flow it's
[25:14] a that was one big jump for me H to come
[25:17] over the turtle of like an asset doesn't
[25:19] have to have cash flow I really did not
[25:21] want it to invest in anything else so
[25:24] Robin what's happening is you find the
[25:26] bit the misinformed people say ah
[25:28] Bitcoin gold they don't have cash flow
[25:30] well of course they don't have cash flow
[25:31] they're alternative assets you know and
[25:34] that's the definition of an alternative
[25:36] asset yeah it's it's outside the
[25:38] financial system so if the financial
[25:40] system goes wrong then you can own
[25:42] something that's not connected to it
[25:45] yeah now of course you can still have a
[25:47] margin call because speculators might be
[25:49] long gold and long Bitcoin and they can
[25:51] still suffer in the short term but in
[25:53] the but you know once that phase has
[25:55] passed it doesn't it's no impact yeah so
[25:58] you know if you if you're walking
[26:00] through a country and that country is
[26:01] going bankrupt yeah and you hold Bitcoin
[26:05] in one hand and gold in the other I
[26:06] don't know how you hold Bitcoin but you
[26:07] know what I mean you walk through that
[26:09] country with Bitcoin and gold it's fine
[26:12] you know the fact that the shares and
[26:14] the bonds collapse doesn't make any
[26:16] difference in the real estate you just
[26:17] keep on walking and you still have
[26:19] Bitcoin and gold yeah that that's a good
[26:22] thing you you you can keep uh your
[26:25] Bitcoin in your in your PR and you don't
[26:26] have to hold it in the in the hands
[26:28] might be good in the airport your brain
[26:30] yeah
[26:31] exactly um really cool that's uh there's
[26:34] so many more topics but I think uh I
[26:36] want to get into with the charts the the
[26:39] that you sent me previously um which is
[26:43] super interesting uh of the ETF inflows
[26:46] Bitcoin and gold and how they are uh
[26:50] uncorrelated correlated of like the
[26:52] opposite correlations um what are we
[26:55] looking at here okay so this is the Bold
[26:58] report and the the uh website's bold.
[27:01] report it's free to all you can download
[27:03] all the information help yourself we
[27:05] talk about the Bold index and there's a
[27:07] menu on the left and we talk about gold
[27:08] and Bitcoin and ETF flows and this chart
[27:11] is in the compare section the the ETF
[27:14] flows where we look at the dollar value
[27:16] of all the global ETFs uh gold and
[27:18] Bitcoin uh money going in in and out of
[27:21] the ecosystem and I think that anyone
[27:23] can figure out very quickly uh that this
[27:26] is the rate of change 90 days and in in
[27:29] US billion dollarss of money going in
[27:30] and out of gold Bitcoin so on the left
[27:32] we've got you know 2020 we've got a huge
[27:35] amount of money going into the gold
[27:37] market then it all comes crashing out
[27:39] and guess what money starts going into
[27:41] Bitcoin for the first time in big size
[27:43] in 200 late 2020
[27:46] 2021 through the ETFs then the opposite
[27:49] happens go comes back in 2022 after
[27:52] Ukraine Invasion um and then a little
[27:54] bit of money comes out of the uh Bitcoin
[27:57] ETS if get ETFs aren't that big at this
[27:59] point because you know we haven't we
[28:01] haven't had the US launches um but then
[28:05] there small outflows from the from the
[28:07] uh uh Bitcoin ETFs in
[28:10] 2022 uh and the money comes back into to
[28:13] Gold again and then we have the US
[28:15] launches and the run-ups of the US
[28:17] launches huge amounts of money going to
[28:18] bitcoin uh nearly 202 billion do over a
[28:21] 90-day period and we've had outflows of
[28:24] gold at the same time and Robin can you
[28:26] to showare the present date I think you
[28:27] moved the chart a bit so do do five year
[28:30] yeah fine and so the LA you so recently
[28:32] in 2025 we've had uh Bitcoin going from
[28:35] huge inflows $2 billion inflows As Trump
[28:38] was elected and we've got the hangover
[28:40] from that it's not a big deal that once
[28:41] you've had 2020 billion do of inflows um
[28:44] for them to flatten off and perhaps
[28:46] Robin on the top top right if you make
[28:48] it 30-day flows then that might be
[28:50] helpful and maybe set the chart to two
[28:53] years um great you're a good operator
[28:56] you're good at this Robin and I'm doing
[28:58] it every day now just I just look how
[29:01] strong occasionally the
[29:03] um the correlations have been in Sy but
[29:05] look how strong they they you they can
[29:07] oppose each other like we saw in end of
[29:10] 2024 and now and so investors are
[29:13] basically interested in gold or Bitcoin
[29:16] and they tend to choose occasionally
[29:18] they might be buying both or selling
[29:19] both at the same time but generally they
[29:21] make a choice and that choice is very
[29:23] simple when it's risk off when the
[29:25] world's in uh you prefer gold and
[29:28] when things are going well you prefer uh
[29:31] Bitcoin it's the same you same decision
[29:32] as bonds and equities and so you know
[29:35] every traditional investor looks at
[29:37] their portfolio says how much in bonds
[29:39] how much in equities and I'm just making
[29:41] the same argument that if you wanted to
[29:42] make an ass a portfolio of alternative
[29:44] assets you mix Bitcoin with super
[29:46] interesting uh to look at that also that
[29:49] correlation is uh so so big I mean uh
[29:54] especially if you look uh just here uh
[29:58] obviously the the Bitcoin ETF in America
[30:01] launched that that that Spike here and
[30:04] then there was another Spike here that
[30:06] that's super fascinating um what what do
[30:09] you expect because a lot of people told
[30:10] me last year um yeah ETF first year is
[30:14] great but they expect actually um that
[30:17] the ETF takes like one two years to
[30:19] really get going for for Bitcoin um
[30:22] because things are just taking a little
[30:24] bit longer decision making trees in in
[30:28] companies and those High individuals
[30:30] might be longer uh also people want to
[30:33] see some history of the ETF to see what
[30:35] the performance is um how how big is how
[30:39] how big do you think will be the Bitcoin
[30:41] ETF going forward uh compared to the the
[30:44] first year uh to to the coming two three
[30:48] four five years well you've got the
[30:50] chart so if you go to compare on the on
[30:52] the left hand side the bottom one the
[30:55] very bottom one ETF
[30:56] Holdings right at the bottom no right at
[30:59] the lower there uh that's Bitcoin and
[31:02] gold uh total AUM in in um um in all the
[31:06] all the all the world's ETFs for Bitcoin
[31:09] so so basically Bitcoin is about1
[31:10] hundred billion dollars um and Gold's
[31:12] about $270 billion do and the total
[31:16] there in green you see is you know
[31:18] approaching 500 so that's the that's the
[31:21] landscape I mean it's it's going to keep
[31:22] on growing because I said to you before
[31:25] you know the wealth management industry
[31:27] that is the Target right so there are
[31:29] 500 billion trillion dollars of assets
[31:32] three qus of those assets are held in
[31:34] own name you know maybe it's a it's
[31:36] maybe it's a pension fund or a um um or
[31:40] it could be just rich people or private
[31:42] houses or whatever other governments but
[31:44] but about a quarter of it is people's
[31:46] wealth and and that is that is the
[31:49] target you know you're looking for a two
[31:51] trillion you're looking for 2% inflow
[31:53] from 125 trillion that's what you're
[31:56] looking for so you know two two or three
[31:58] trillion dollarss to come into Bitcoin
[32:00] um over the next 30 40 years I mean that
[32:03] that's how I would suggest it yeah and
[32:06] um and so that's you know all the money
[32:08] in Bitcoin today is is two trillion and
[32:11] that's just the ETF portion but of
[32:13] course most of that money would come
[32:14] into ETF because you know that it's the
[32:18] big money is not going to buy a hardware
[32:20] wallet and um and worry about Keys
[32:22] they're just going to buy a solution
[32:24] that's that's got insurance and um and
[32:26] and professional custom
[32:28] let's take a break for a moment and
[32:30] appreciate the beauty that coin
[32:33] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[32:35] watches those watches are the most
[32:38] amazing the most elegent way of showing
[32:41] that you are a true bitcoiner and coin
[32:44] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[32:47] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:50] watch collections you have the date of
[32:52] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:56] there and of course also the block
[32:58] height and which Epoch we are currently
[33:01] in I love the level of detail they put
[33:04] in in this masterpiece make sure to
[33:06] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:09] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[33:12] love those watches so so much and now if
[33:15] you have Bitcoin I really do hope that
[33:18] you don't have it on Exchange but if you
[33:20] do have it on Exchange I have two ways
[33:22] for you to deal with that the first way
[33:24] is you put it on a hardware wallet
[33:26] that's the entry for you to get into the
[33:29] self custody game I recommend bitbox
[33:33] Bitcoin only Edition for that it's a
[33:35] super simple and secure way and if you
[33:38] check out the link in the description
[33:40] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[33:43] Robin and the second way is the Bitcoin
[33:46] way the Bitcoin way is your Allin
[33:49] partner in terms of how to get the most
[33:52] out of your sovereignty they will
[33:55] personalize for you a self custody setup
[33:58] that is perfect for your individual
[34:01] situation they will show you how you can
[34:03] secure your own devices securing your
[34:06] Bitcoin is not enough you also have to
[34:08] keep all your devices secure one topic
[34:11] that is overlooked often is the
[34:13] inheritance plan what happens with your
[34:16] Bitcoin once you are no longer here do
[34:19] you have a plan for that in place
[34:21] already and last but not least if you're
[34:23] in a jurisdictions where you don't feel
[34:25] safe it's better to get a BL and B for
[34:28] all that head over to the Bitcoin
[34:30] way.com
[34:32] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[34:36] just a quick side note I will be for the
[34:38] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[34:41] Prague event in June it will be
[34:44] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[34:46] looking forward to seeing all of you
[34:48] there you can get your ticket in the
[34:50] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[34:53] Brock and very important use code Robin
[34:56] to get 10% of your ticket I'm really
[34:59] looking forward seeing you there how do
[35:01] you actually look at uh custody of yeah
[35:04] gold and Bitcoin because both you can
[35:07] hold either in Banks exchanges or like
[35:10] ETFs but also you can hold it yourself
[35:12] in in in self- custody with with C maybe
[35:16] a little bit more cost costly to to hold
[35:19] it yourself depending on the how much
[35:22] but how do you look at keep getting your
[35:24] own self- custody in in gold and Bitcoin
[35:28] I mean it's not something I consider
[35:30] yeah it's not something that interests
[35:31] me because I'm not forecasting the end
[35:33] of the world and if I was forecasting
[35:35] the end of the world I would want guns
[35:37] and food 10 food and guns you know and
[35:40] and so you know if the world was ending
[35:43] what what what use is goney going to
[35:45] be so I I kind of making a simple
[35:49] assumption that the system will continue
[35:52] and um and so therefore I trust the
[35:54] system of custody I always have done and
[35:57] um obviously you have to you know make
[35:58] sure you use good custodians I mean in
[36:01] my product in bold we use JP Morgan for
[36:03] the gold so there are three main
[36:05] custodians in London UBS HSBC and and JP
[36:10] and then for Bitcoin we use copper um
[36:12] which is you know one of the leading
[36:14] custodians in the business and that
[36:16] enables you know someone to pick up the
[36:18] phone and put a large order in and
[36:20] transact immediately and a tight spread
[36:22] if everything's in In Cold Storage or in
[36:25] uh deep vaults or something then then
[36:28] you can't do that then then you lose
[36:30] liquidity so I think the mechanism the
[36:33] mechanism of custody um is very powerful
[36:36] and very effective for the financial
[36:38] system we have and I know lots of people
[36:40] listening well will you know will not
[36:43] trust JP Morgan for gold and stuff and
[36:45] believe stories they've read it's just
[36:46] not true I mean it's a great custodian
[36:49] and and the gold is held separately in
[36:51] what's called an allocated account it's
[36:53] not lent out or leased and um and and I
[36:56] think whatever you say about gold what
[36:57] whatever you do to Plate people and say
[37:00] that there's no problem in the gold
[37:01] market there'll always be some
[37:03] on the internet who'll keep writing
[37:05] stories and people will believe it and
[37:07] this is going to go on and on and on
[37:09] it's one advantage that Bitcoin has
[37:11] because you have an address um and it's
[37:14] much it's much simpler it's like a bar
[37:16] number almost um but it's much simpler
[37:18] to keep keep an eye on what's Happening
[37:21] and where the Bitcoin is than it is for
[37:22] God it's got that transparency so it's
[37:25] one of those it's a clear Bitcoin advant
[37:27] advant AG the audit the audit trade is
[37:30] incredible yeah you can you can clearly
[37:33] make like proof of reserves of like hey
[37:36] this is the this is just the address
[37:39] that we have and there we store our
[37:41] Bitcoin and and there we can see it um
[37:44] that that's that's just something I I I
[37:47] hope we come to world where it's normal
[37:49] for every exchange custodian ETF holders
[37:53] like to have a proof of Reserve where
[37:55] you can just look at like oh that's
[37:57] actually how much Bitcoin they have uh
[38:00] that that that makes sense uh more and
[38:02] more people make it more and more
[38:04] institutions are actually going ahead
[38:06] and doing that uh and I think it's a
[38:08] it's a Healy thing to bring transparency
[38:10] in because we have that feature in
[38:12] Bitcoin and I hope more and more
[38:14] institutions are are using are using
[38:17] that and that that's a that that that's
[38:20] a really good thing and it's interesting
[38:21] because I have a a Bitcoin Bitcoin only
[38:25] audience and I uh make a lot of
[38:29] advertisement for self custody I'm like
[38:31] okay even if you don't want to do it at
[38:33] least learn about it so you understand
[38:35] Bitcoin better and still even though I
[38:37] make a lot of advertisement for self
[38:38] custody around 50% do it around 50%
[38:42] don't do don't do it uh so that that's I
[38:44] think usually the split uh in in other
[38:46] audiences a little bit more even of of
[38:49] of people that don't do it um uh but
[38:52] yeah there there are solid reasons of of
[38:55] of of why you should have
[38:58] SE custy and and not trust some
[39:00] exchanges uh but if you have it on on on
[39:04] some good exchange that has been around
[39:06] for a long time maybe it's not that big
[39:08] of a deal um but I always say like hey
[39:12] get get it on on the exchange it it's
[39:14] way safer Al against hackers like people
[39:17] can get hacked way more easily on
[39:19] exchanges on centralized platforms than
[39:22] uh if they have it in in cold storage
[39:25] and it's it's not as complicated and not
[39:29] as expensive also uh in terms of of
[39:33] doing the DF fees are most likely more
[39:36] than than what you uh use for the the
[39:39] the self custody but yeah I I I I agree
[39:43] that we need as many different custodian
[39:46] options for people that want to do it or
[39:48] not do it even though I don't believe
[39:50] the world will go to go to hell anytime
[39:53] soon I still prefer having own Bitcoin
[39:56] somewhere where I have some control over
[39:58] it yeah no I take your point I think
[40:00] with with crypto exchanges yeah
[40:02] obviously you shouldn't leave money on
[40:04] those um I think we we learned that
[40:06] years ago M back to Mount go um that's
[40:10] where we learned that lesson but I but I
[40:12] but the ETF structure is not you know
[40:14] leaving money in an ETF is not leaving
[40:16] money on an exchange they are using C
[40:18] Storage Solutions as well on your behalf
[40:21] and the other thing is they have
[40:22] insurance if if things do go wrong then
[40:25] you should be made good touch would it's
[40:27] never been tested because we've never
[40:29] had a problem in the ETF land because it
[40:32] works so well and and that's because
[40:34] you're using Financial infrastructure
[40:36] has been around for a long time it's
[40:38] been tested I do agree with you a lot on
[40:40] that one point that I forgot to touch on
[40:41] is um if you think the because people
[40:44] actually bring that up as a negative
[40:46] Point against Bitcoin like oh like what
[40:48] if uh all the electricity is gone and
[40:51] like we're going back to like Stone ages
[40:54] I'm like yeah but I don't know that that
[40:57] then you have to have a totally
[40:59] different strategy anyways like that
[41:01] then you should live on some Farm get a
[41:03] lot of cousins around you that can uh
[41:07] help you build some some Farmland out
[41:09] and and get a lot of guns like the world
[41:12] will be very different uh and those are
[41:15] usually people people usually bring that
[41:17] argument up in like with a Macbook and a
[41:20] Starbucks and in living in the city so
[41:23] like you need a whole different setup of
[41:26] your life if you really think the world
[41:28] is going that way uh and I do hope that
[41:32] that we don't go that that
[41:35] direction if you have that situation
[41:38] then cities implode and the countryside
[41:40] is the only place to be and um yeah but
[41:44] but I don't think there's much point I
[41:45] don't think I don't think earing Bitcoin
[41:46] and gold has anything to do with that
[41:48] that's an extreme scenario I think we're
[41:50] just talking about alternative assets
[41:52] that are liquid and they have a place in
[41:55] the system um you know why do people own
[41:58] gold well the central banks own gold so
[42:00] therefore that's okay you know most
[42:02] people own some gold personally
[42:04] particularly women around the world some
[42:06] men too you know so that so that's
[42:08] distributed and in Bitcoin is that
[42:11] journey is younger but it's still is
[42:14] still ongoing more and more people own
[42:15] it and so I think that it's important to
[42:18] recognize that one of the strengths of
[42:19] both assets is they are widely
[42:21] distributed and very very liquid you
[42:24] know and the volatility of gold is about
[42:26] 15 % which is quite low it's a bit bit
[42:28] like the S&P 500 or the Euros stocks
[42:31] quite similar to that whereas the
[42:33] volatility of Bitcoin is about 40% which
[42:36] is more like an oil stock yeah or a um a
[42:40] Natural Resources stock something like
[42:42] that it's not or a steel company it's
[42:45] it's it's it's it's not that high
[42:46] anymore and people talk about how
[42:48] Bitcoin is volatile it really isn't you
[42:51] know Junior crypto is volatile but
[42:53] senior crypto which means Bitcoin isn't
[42:56] I don't know if I actually asked you
[42:57] that in the in the last episode if I did
[43:00] not ask it it's good that I ask it now
[43:02] if you could only have one of those two
[43:06] assets uh which one would you do and and
[43:08] why because I'm old i' just choose
[43:11] gold um because I have total faith that
[43:15] um so the scenario I would ask is you
[43:18] know you're going you're going away for
[43:20] 10 years in the spaceship and you're
[43:21] coming back what are you going to do
[43:23] before you go you have to choose one
[43:25] you're coming back I have certainty that
[43:27] Gold's going to do a good job but I
[43:29] think there's a very small chance that
[43:30] Bitcoin goes wrong it's a small chance I
[43:34] think there a there's a large chance it
[43:35] does well and a small chance it does
[43:37] badly whereas I think bitco with gold I
[43:40] think there much more certainty it's
[43:41] going to be quite boring but it's going
[43:43] to be okay good point of like in 10
[43:45] years gold will probably not do the
[43:48] performance of Bitcoin um but the chance
[43:52] of gold going away
[43:54] like almost zero uh nothing for me in
[43:58] Risk is is anytime zero but uh
[44:02] Bitcoin because it's it's only been only
[44:05] been around for 16 years uh there's
[44:08] always a Black Swan uh uh event that's
[44:11] that possible happen I would still go
[44:13] with with with Bitcoin um you're young
[44:17] just yeah just because I'm I'm
[44:21] 25 it makes sense right I mean I mean
[44:24] don't don't misread it I mean I want to
[44:25] own both so my owns both and I want to
[44:28] talk about how how much of each right so
[44:31] some people will say ah 5050 own Bitcoin
[44:34] and gold great the problem with that the
[44:37] problem with 5050 is you haven't you
[44:39] haven't maxed out the pair because the
[44:41] chance of losing if you put $100 into
[44:44] Bitcoin and gold 50 into each the chance
[44:46] of losing a dollar in each asset is more
[44:49] likely to make or lose a dollar in
[44:50] Bitcoin than you are in go right whereas
[44:53] if you do risk risk weighted which is
[44:55] what I do which is related to the
[44:57] volatility you end up with three
[44:58] quarters gold one quarter um in Bitcoin
[45:02] and now your chance of making or losing
[45:03] a dollar in each asset is the
[45:05] same so that's what we mean by putting
[45:07] the same amount of risk into each asset
[45:09] yeah lots of gold little bit of Bitcoin
[45:12] and of course if if gold was more risky
[45:14] than Bitcoin in terms of volatility then
[45:17] we'd have more Bitcoin than
[45:19] gold and so this very thing and because
[45:22] they have low correlation or negative
[45:24] correlation as we saw those charts
[45:25] earlier here one goes up the other goes
[45:27] down these things offset each other
[45:29] routinely all the time you when you see
[45:31] Bitcoin up 10% in a day Go's probably
[45:34] down when you see a good day for gold
[45:37] bitcoin's probably down yeah it happens
[45:40] more often than you think and if you
[45:41] start observing the two together on the
[45:43] days you go my God it's very rare that
[45:46] they're having a good day at the same
[45:48] sometimes they do sometimes they both
[45:49] have a bad day um but just quite often
[45:52] they're just against each other and so
[45:54] that's why it's very important so the
[45:56] whole bold proc is about rebalancing so
[45:58] the reason why you know you keep the
[46:00] risk you correct which is which is
[46:02] roughly we published the numbers it's
[46:03] free on the website um but it's roughly
[46:06] 3/4 one quarter but then you rebalance
[46:08] every month so you're buying the one
[46:10] that that went down and selling the one
[46:11] that went up you know bringing it back
[46:14] and that adds another 5 to 7% per year
[46:16] to your return now I know to a Bitcoin
[46:18] that's no big deal but you know to a
[46:20] trfy investor to have the return of
[46:22] Bitcoin and gold and another 5 to 7%
[46:25] it's very nice do you think there's the
[46:28] risk of gold being um how do I phrase
[46:31] that uh because we're getting a more and
[46:33] more digital world and and people like
[46:35] to to to own something uh more more
[46:38] digital and and they like for example me
[46:41] I I wouldn't even be talking about Gold
[46:44] without without Bitcoin in my
[46:47] environment uh the people let's say
[46:49] under 35 when I talk about investment
[46:52] they either do ETFs or Bitcoin so they
[46:55] are either uh not believing in Bitcoin
[46:58] and then then you do the ETFs or they
[47:00] doing Bitcoin or a mix of that is still
[47:03] a risk that bit that gold is is going
[47:06] down to the let's say utility gold uh uh
[47:09] jewelry value whatever the percentage is
[47:12] without the monetary premium if if maybe
[47:15] like governments and central banks long
[47:16] term hold uh Bitcoin instead of instead
[47:19] of gold that's always a risk you know
[47:21] that something else comes along probably
[47:23] Bitcoin and um and gold becomes
[47:26] irrelevant but given that China is
[47:28] buying a thousand tons or whatever at
[47:30] the moment every every every quarter or
[47:34] year or something and they're all just
[47:35] buying it right so it's not happening
[47:36] this month yeah it's not happening this
[47:39] year so may maybe your view um in 10 20
[47:43] 30 years time is possible absolutely but
[47:45] gold has changed its role Gold's been in
[47:47] the financial system for 5,000 years and
[47:49] its role has never been
[47:51] constant the only constant thing has
[47:54] been the brand you know the element and
[47:56] the fact that if you and the recognition
[47:58] you go so it's been used in jewelry and
[48:01] you know portable money portable jewelry
[48:03] and and also you take gold from one side
[48:05] of the world to the other 500 years ago
[48:07] and everyone's happy yeah I can deal
[48:09] with that the Visa card of its day yeah
[48:12] you turn up with gold other side of the
[48:14] world no problem get business done and
[48:17] um and that that's a real thing yeah so
[48:21] it's had different roles over the years
[48:24] um and and then and then you in the 20th
[48:26] century until 1971 it had a formal role
[48:30] where currencies were pegged to it and
[48:32] of course most of them couldn't stay on
[48:34] that Peg so were devaluations every now
[48:36] and then as is always the say the case
[48:38] in a fixed exchange regime as you
[48:40] through history we've seen them always
[48:42] come under pressure Asia in the 1990s
[48:44] the euro is still working but you know a
[48:46] lot of people say well give it time so
[48:48] you know these things these things
[48:51] always come under pressure it's very
[48:53] difficult to manage exchange rates
[48:54] across two countries with Central
[48:56] planning
[48:57] yeah and so um go Gold's come out Gold's
[49:01] had many different roles formal and
[49:03] informal currently gold has an informal
[49:06] role in the financial system no one told
[49:08] China and Indonesia and Qatar to buy
[49:11] gold they made their own decision yeah
[49:14] they chose to buy gold it's not written
[49:16] down that they should have these gold
[49:18] reserves and that's an important point
[49:20] so they can make their own decision
[49:21] about Bitcoin when the time comes and I
[49:23] think if the US start the trend you know
[49:26] maybe people will start to get
[49:28] interested but you need one big country
[49:30] to come in and um you know I think it it
[49:33] would be great be great if the US
[49:35] underpin
[49:37] Bitcoin I don't think they I don't think
[49:39] they need to because they can tax you
[49:41] know if people if American citizens buy
[49:44] Bitcoin and it goes up they sell it they
[49:46] pay tax so you know the country benefits
[49:50] the US government benefits from
[49:53] appreciating Bitcoin anyway so why would
[49:56] they do that they would say okay well we
[49:58] want to have a reserve that's got risk
[49:59] on qualities at the moment they' got
[50:01] gold which is a riskof quality but
[50:03] they'd have to make a case why they
[50:04] wanted to reserve with a risk on quality
[50:07] I'm sure they could make that
[50:09] case it's it's super interesting for me
[50:12] that America already now framed it as a
[50:15] strategic Bitcoin Reserve uh and did
[50:18] that step which just comes very early
[50:22] for me I did not expect that at all like
[50:24] uh Budan yes a very small small country
[50:27] which is smaller than Vienna uh they
[50:30] they are buying Bitcoin okay El Salvador
[50:33] doing things that that's that's great uh
[50:36] but a a a force like America honestly
[50:40] shocked me and it it's still uh I'm
[50:43] still in disbelief that they actually uh
[50:47] they actually did it it it was like
[50:48] something like yeah maybe 2030 2035 or
[50:51] something like that but yeah 2095 seems
[50:54] very very early and then it's like okay
[50:57] if America does that that might trigger
[51:00] something in the UAE maybe China is
[51:02] doing secretly already something it's
[51:05] the whole game theory aspect is really
[51:06] fun to to talk about yeah and I I think
[51:10] the one thing about Bitcoin has never
[51:12] been D you know in all the years I've
[51:14] been following the Bitcoin stories it's
[51:17] always been fascinating I mean my
[51:19] favorite one although the last couple of
[51:21] years been pretty interesting my
[51:23] favorite one of all was you know how the
[51:25] whole Bank banking system and try to
[51:27] shut down Bitcoin you know 2013 14 15
[51:31] and and they came back with a stable
[51:33] coin you know what's why why do you need
[51:35] ethereum so you need ethereum to drive
[51:37] stable coins without ethereum you can't
[51:39] have a stable coin why some people would
[51:41] say you can have it using Bitcoin but
[51:44] basically we have these uh the these
[51:46] token platforms and um and and they
[51:49] enable lots of different things to
[51:51] happen but ultimately they enable you to
[51:53] bypass the banking system and that's
[51:55] incredible it's absolutely incredible
[51:57] now you can have um $100 um and move it
[52:02] across the internet without a bank that
[52:04] is
[52:05] incredible and and it's all it's all an
[52:08] own goal from Regulators it would never
[52:10] have happened and the speed and success
[52:14] that the county has if they hadn't been
[52:16] so obstructive to the the banking system
[52:18] hadn't been so obstructive to
[52:20] bitcoin absolutely really cool um by the
[52:24] way um what message do you have usually
[52:27] do people that don't like Bitcoin and uh
[52:31] are into bck into gold uh like Peter
[52:33] shift I mean even recently he almost
[52:36] came around calling Bitcoin digital gold
[52:39] but for for uh for people that uh liking
[52:42] gold and they're like oh like why do we
[52:44] need this this this Bitcoin thing me
[52:47] just be open-minded about all assets I
[52:49] mean you know I don't you don't have to
[52:51] own everything you have to like
[52:52] everything but but it's got its place I
[52:55] think if you've got a market like
[52:56] Bitcoin that's as big as it is after all
[52:58] these years and it's been through all
[53:00] the challenges and tests that this has
[53:02] and it's got the liquidity and the and
[53:04] the uh the widely distributed ownership
[53:07] and Market depth I you know you you
[53:09] can't ignore that and you have to be you
[53:11] have to be I can understand if someone
[53:13] doesn't understand Finance would would
[53:15] say okay doesn't mean anything to me
[53:17] that's fine but anyone understands
[53:19] Finance if you if you know if you ignore
[53:21] it then I think you should look at the
[53:23] mirror and think and say you know maybe
[53:25] I should go back
[53:27] understand Finance again because I'm
[53:28] clearly missing something that's quite
[53:30] pretty big and real and it's out there
[53:33] yeah P pony schemes don't last for 16
[53:36] years um and and and grow and grow and
[53:39] grow you know Bitcoin is many things but
[53:42] it's not a bonsy scheme and uh you know
[53:45] it's it's a digital asset and if you
[53:48] can't get your head around that I mean I
[53:49] I find that extraordinary it's so
[53:51] obvious that yeah we were always going
[53:53] to have digital assets I you you have to
[53:55] look at total Rec Arnold Schwarzenegger
[53:58] when he's traveling to Mars and he's you
[54:01] know the price is five credits and you
[54:03] know that this was telling us in in
[54:05] sci-fi that that we are going to have
[54:07] this kind of digital money in the future
[54:10] and it's here and so um you know I find
[54:14] that I find that very exciting transf I
[54:16] don't like Bitcoin because they didn't
[54:17] invent it it didn't come from Goldman
[54:20] Sachs it didn't come from the Central
[54:22] Bank it didn't come from the ECB or the
[54:24] IMF or the alphabet soup it it came from
[54:29] and um and it's a sort of revolutionary
[54:31] idea and they don't like that and and
[54:35] that's the problem no one's in control
[54:37] you know the thing that and the
[54:38] hilarious bit about Bitcoin is you got a
[54:40] complaints department well call Bitcoin
[54:42] complaints department you know call the
[54:44] CEO get a statement there isn't one
[54:47] there is no complaint department there
[54:48] is no CEO and and the same is true with
[54:51] gold everything in everything in finance
[54:54] real estate bonds um equities there's
[54:58] always a CEO there's always someone
[54:59] responsible in alternative assets no
[55:02] one's
[55:03] responsible there just ownership dread
[55:05] can cannot deal with that I I like that
[55:08] um I asked I think last time I actually
[55:10] did not ask that uh because I didn't
[55:12] have the routine but I now ask each and
[55:14] every one of my guests um what we can
[55:17] learn from you besides Bitcoin he well
[55:20] Bitcoin is my night job and gold my day
[55:22] job is tradire research and so at B Tre
[55:27] . um you know we we have a we do lots of
[55:30] free stuff we we write about uh golden
[55:32] Bitcoin and lots and lots of stocks and
[55:35] markets and things and so you know feel
[55:37] free to look at what we do it's it's
[55:39] it's out there um and and I think we did
[55:42] a good job very cool thank you so much
[55:44] um we have an end routine in the podcast
[55:46] where the previous guest is asking a
[55:48] question for the next guest without
[55:50] knowing who the next guest actually is
[55:52] uh and it's an interesting what
[55:54] interesting question what does currently
[55:58] uh stop businesses to adopt Bitcoin
[56:02] um well I think the whole treasury thing
[56:04] has bit is is a fashion on bitcoin land
[56:07] that's not in the real world you know
[56:09] most most companies the idea of
[56:12] corporate treasury a you ask why do you
[56:14] have a treasury you should just pay out
[56:16] the money to shareholders or buy back
[56:17] shares or pay dividends why why why are
[56:19] you sitting on large amounts of cash
[56:21] that would be the traditional investment
[56:23] view companies should not have large
[56:25] amounts of cash they should have enough
[56:27] but not too much so why have a reserve
[56:30] is one reason and two if you do the
[56:32] current thinking is own cash and bonds
[56:35] uh but the bitcoiners say well no if
[56:38] you're going to have a large reserves
[56:39] then you need to have um you know good
[56:41] assets for the long term and all that
[56:43] stuff and I and I would say there's a
[56:46] clash you know the bitcoiners are saying
[56:47] the choice is Bitcoin but I think that
[56:50] the corporate sector is generally would
[56:51] say we it's not our job to have large
[56:54] large reserves you know you know maybe
[56:57] it's okay for Bach outway but for most
[56:59] companies you they make toothpaste they
[57:01] should focus on making toothpaste they
[57:03] got too much cash give it to Sher so I
[57:05] think that companies are not the place
[57:07] to look I would look at the asset pop
[57:10] the 500 trillion of assets particularly
[57:12] the allocators of those assets yeah so
[57:14] the people that own the shares of the
[57:16] toothpaste company that's the target not
[57:18] the company itself in my opinion that's
[57:21] an interesting one never looked at it
[57:23] that way but I guess uh
[57:27] um people like to have the uh don't like
[57:31] to have even operating cash in in US
[57:34] dollars because it's sinking away and
[57:35] and they have to have some some cash
[57:37] reserves and and then like they they
[57:40] might look at like hey like 5% of the
[57:42] cash flow cash reserves can be other
[57:44] things but there are a bunch of
[57:46] companies that then try real estate then
[57:48] try stocks and and companies like all of
[57:51] the sudden like portfolio managers
[57:54] outside of what they're doing it's it's
[57:56] kind of kind of frustrating because
[57:58] money is so bad they have to venture
[58:00] into I don't know uh real estate and
[58:03] stocks and and other
[58:05] portfolios uh which is almost kind of
[58:08] kind of sad to to to see would be would
[58:11] be cool in a Bitcoin only the world
[58:13] where they just can have Bitcoin I can I
[58:15] ask a question to your next
[58:17] guest yeah I usually do it offline but
[58:20] you can if you already have it you can
[58:22] give it to me now I've just thought of
[58:23] it why so to your next guest why is
[58:26] Bitcoin so tightly correlated with
[58:28] technology stocks I like that one
[58:30] tightly correlated because uh it it it's
[58:35] frustrating it
[58:36] is tech stocks I like that one um really
