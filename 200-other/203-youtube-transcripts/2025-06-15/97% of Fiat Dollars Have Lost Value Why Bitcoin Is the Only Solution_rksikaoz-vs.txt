[00:00] How do I explain this thing? You're
[00:02] like, "Oh jeez, yeah, where do we
[00:04] start?" Tell me what they think money
[00:06] is. And the definition that they give
[00:08] you will tell me how to approach this.
[00:10] Bitcoin is becoming the more obvious
[00:13] asset choice, you know, for any type of
[00:16] savings that you could want. Like real
[00:17] estate was the savings. So when you see
[00:19] good money, when you see beautifully
[00:21] engineered money like Bitcoin, like the
[00:23] most beautiful money that we can ever
[00:24] imagine, they can't recognize it for
[00:27] what it is because they themselves don't
[00:29] know what money is. That's how the
[00:31] economy is today. That everyone's
[00:32] working, driving to work, hustling,
[00:34] working hard, trying to produce for
[00:36] their family, but they're earning these
[00:38] things that are worthless. And when they
[00:40] try to go buy stuff with these tokens,
[00:42] these fiat dollars they're working for,
[00:44] they can barely buy the stakes for the
[00:45] barbecue. They can barely pay rent. They
[00:47] can't buy a
[00:48] [Music]
[00:52] house. I keep getting asked the question
[00:54] over and over. How do you explain
[00:56] Bitcoin? Like we have some, you know,
[00:58] the same question. You know the
[00:59] question. I'm talking to some friend.
[01:01] Tom, you convinced me. I'm talking to
[01:03] some friends. How do I explain this
[01:05] thing? You're like, oh jeez. Yeah. Where
[01:08] do we start?
[01:09] Yeah. Yeah. I think it's also not
[01:11] something like if you really want to
[01:14] start from zero, it's not something that
[01:15] you can explain within like a small
[01:18] conversation. Like you you you need a
[01:20] longer journey. And if if there's a if
[01:24] he already knows gold, uh then there's a
[01:26] good start starting point there. If he
[01:28] already has some money and and those
[01:30] values in them, then you brought the
[01:32] digital thing in there. But with most
[01:34] people, you start in zero and it's it's
[01:36] not accomplished in I think in one. You
[01:38] can only spark something. No. Yeah,
[01:40] agreed. I I lately I asked them, listen,
[01:43] how does that person you're talking to
[01:44] define money? Tell me what they think
[01:47] money is. And the definition that they
[01:50] give you will tell me how to approach
[01:52] this because if they can't define money,
[01:56] how do we have this conversation? So
[01:59] like I need some
[02:00] baseline, you know, and then usually
[02:02] that will give me some clue into how
[02:04] people are thinking and the definition
[02:05] they give me of money cuz some people
[02:07] will use the line like, well, you know,
[02:09] the dollar used to be money when it was
[02:12] backed by gold. So then I'm like, okay,
[02:14] let's talk about that a little bit. So
[02:16] that's usually where I try to enter the
[02:19] conversation. I love that way. I never
[02:21] heard that. But before we start with
[02:23] what is money because I think it's a
[02:24] fascinating conversation. Um, uh, for a
[02:27] few people that don't know you, who are
[02:29] you and and what are you doing in
[02:30] Bitcoin? Sure. So, my name is Tom Karza.
[02:33] I worked in tech. I got, you know, I'm
[02:35] the story. Went to school, got a good
[02:37] job. Uh, I went to university, got a
[02:40] good job in tech. I worked for a company
[02:41] called Oracle, a database company.
[02:43] Decided I didn't want to work in the
[02:45] corporate world, quit my job, and
[02:46] together with my brother launched
[02:48] Rockstar Real Estate because in our 20s,
[02:50] we were buying rental properties as a
[02:53] way to outpace a basement. We didn't use
[02:56] those words at the time, but we
[02:57] realized, wow, if we buy these rental
[03:00] properties and people pay us rent and
[03:01] they produce cash flow, they seem to
[03:03] appreciate and we get this this cash
[03:05] flow component to it, it's a good way
[03:07] for us to quote unquote get ahead. And
[03:09] so, I quit my job and started Rockstar
[03:12] Real Estate with my brother to help
[03:14] Canadians back in 2007. We started uh
[03:17] buy rental properties all across the
[03:19] greater Toronto area. And we've been
[03:21] doing that now for years. and you know
[03:23] multiple people have of have hundreds
[03:25] thousands of investors we've worked with
[03:27] on billions of dollars of rental
[03:29] properties and um then 2020 rolls around
[03:33] like everyone Robin I have some time I
[03:37] start someone mentions the Bitcoin
[03:39] standard to me I had dismissed Bitcoin I
[03:42] read the Bitcoin standard I did not know
[03:44] Bitcoin had a supply cap like I didn't
[03:46] know there was a limit of 21 million I
[03:48] didn't know anything I didn't know about
[03:49] nodes I didn't know about the mining I
[03:51] didn't know about the architecture
[03:53] And uh I bought my first bit of Bitcoin
[03:55] and and like most people when you go
[03:57] down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. When you
[03:59] buy your first little bit and then you
[04:00] read more and learn more, you realize,
[04:03] holy I don't I don't know if I'm
[04:05] allowed to swear here, Robin. Uh like,
[04:07] holy, holy smokes. Holy smokes. Uh I
[04:11] don't have nearly enough Bitcoin. And
[04:13] then we started going down the rabbit
[04:15] hole even further and we started talking
[04:17] about it with our real estate clients
[04:18] and we said, "Listen, you need to
[04:19] introduce this into your portfolios.
[04:21] We've been talking rental properties,
[04:23] but there's this other thing that you
[04:26] need to look at. We've talked about gold
[04:27] for a long time, but you need to check
[04:30] this Bitcoin thing out. And so, for the
[04:32] last five years now, we have basically
[04:35] turned our discussions in with clients
[04:37] into, hey, there's real estate, but look
[04:40] at all the properties of Bitcoin.
[04:42] Investigate this thing. And we have
[04:44] client events where we bring out our
[04:45] clients as a bit of a thank you. You
[04:46] know, I was just mentioning to you
[04:47] before recording, we had a thou 1,100
[04:50] real estate investor clients out and uh
[04:52] we had Leon Vancou come out from Germany
[04:54] to talk about it and we we had uh BTC
[04:57] Sessions come in from Calgary, Jeff
[04:59] Booth has spoken at our events, Greg
[05:00] Foss has spoken at our events. So now we
[05:03] are like this weird business where we
[05:06] started with real estate as a means to
[05:08] financially get ahead and live life on
[05:10] your own terms and now we're talking
[05:13] about both things real estate and
[05:16] Bitcoin and uh yeah that's kind of how
[05:19] we got to this point. Robin, I don't
[05:20] know if that's too quick of a summary
[05:21] for you or not. It's it's it's perfect.
[05:24] But but you're still holding real estate
[05:27] and developing uh things in real estate.
[05:30] We are.
[05:32] Yes, but it does become harder and
[05:35] because there's always going to be a
[05:36] need like shelter is a need like people
[05:38] need a a roof over their house. So, and
[05:40] and a business needs a roof. There's
[05:41] always going to be utility value of real
[05:43] estate. There's no doubt. It's just the
[05:45] monetization component of real estate is
[05:48] likely going to be removed from that
[05:51] asset class as Bitcoin grows and grabs
[05:54] more of that. So, yes, we still have
[05:57] real estate. And I guess the reason that
[05:59] I'm hesitating with the answer is that
[06:00] Bitcoin is becoming the more obvious
[06:03] asset choice of, you know, for any to
[06:06] any type of savings that you could want.
[06:08] Like real estate was the savings. It was
[06:10] almost like we would tell people, you
[06:12] know, when you go to an ATM or a bank
[06:13] machine and there's like a checking
[06:15] button in in North America anyway, there
[06:17] was a checking button and a savings
[06:18] button. You might as well have replaced
[06:20] the savings button with a picture of a
[06:21] house because all Canadians started
[06:24] buying real estate as their savings. And
[06:27] that was the way. And no Canadians
[06:29] really wanted to, none of our clients
[06:30] really wanted to buy real. Nobody wants
[06:32] to become a landlord. You're forced into
[06:35] it. And now with Bitcoin, it's like,
[06:38] wow, there's this other option. And the
[06:41] difficulty uh becomes with most people
[06:44] that they don't have enough knowledge to
[06:46] fully understand what Bitcoin is. So,
[06:48] it's not like there is a stampede out of
[06:50] the real estate gates, but more and more
[06:52] of our clients are adding Bitcoin to
[06:54] their lives. and some of the Bitcoin
[06:57] maxis in on a percentage basis maybe
[06:59] it's like 5% or Bitcoin maxis they're
[07:02] selling real estate and buying Bitcoin.
[07:05] So it's still a mix for sure for us. am
[07:09] asking because I see more and more real
[07:11] estate people uh especially those who
[07:13] who come on my show uh smaller bubble
[07:17] that just go ahead and sell real estate
[07:20] and they all tell me oh I still have
[07:23] real estate not because I want it just
[07:25] because it takes a long time to get rid
[07:26] of all of all of it. Yeah. And that's
[07:28] the case with us too. Like with myself
[07:30] and my brother some of our properties
[07:31] are inside corporations in Canada and
[07:33] there's certain tax things that we have
[07:35] to deal with. So it's not like we can
[07:36] snap our fingers. It's not like exactly
[07:39] as liquid as something like Bitcoin. So,
[07:41] that's part of the reason.
[07:43] [Music]
[07:45] Um, yeah. Yeah. You're you're just
[07:47] making me think why the heck are we
[07:50] doing what we're doing, you know? And it
[07:52] looks like our business, Robin, just
[07:54] many clients probably don't understand
[07:55] this, but at this point, I look at our
[07:56] businesses as a bit of a Trojan horse
[07:58] for Bitcoin because they know they have
[08:01] to do something to outpace the
[08:02] debasement of their currency. They're
[08:04] working really hard. They don't
[08:06] understand why they're not getting
[08:07] ahead. They discover our business and
[08:09] they thought, "Oh, okay. I've heard real
[08:10] estate is a way to get ahead
[08:12] financially. We kind of bring them in.
[08:14] We teach them about rental properties,
[08:16] duplexes, student rental properties."
[08:18] Then we eventually teach them about
[08:20] central banking and how central banking
[08:22] is evil. And then so we take them
[08:25] through this journey and then once we
[08:26] talk about central banking, how central
[08:27] banking is evil, then we kind of
[08:29] slightly introduce this concept of
[08:31] Bitcoin and say, "Hey, you should check
[08:32] out this little thing over here." So,
[08:34] our business has become this weird
[08:37] Trojan horse for Bitcoin. It's almost
[08:39] like we're working for Bitcoin, but
[08:40] Bitcoin didn't hire us, but we are here
[08:43] working for Bitcoin on everyone's
[08:44] behalf, right? So, and it's a big step
[08:48] still for a lot of people to walk in the
[08:49] doors of our business and if we were to
[08:52] say, hey, you know, take your life
[08:54] savings and don't buy that property you
[08:56] thought you were going to buy. Put it
[08:57] all into Bitcoin. Currently, for most
[09:00] people, that is too big of a jump still.
[09:02] You know, there's going to be the bit
[09:03] Bitcoin maxis who won't understand that.
[09:05] And I consider myself a Bitcoin maxi,
[09:07] but it it's mentally a big step for
[09:10] someone to take their whole life savings
[09:11] and having one discussion with you. We
[09:14] have to let people to come to this
[09:15] conclusion themselves. And we look we I
[09:17] look at our business as facilitating
[09:19] that movement. For me, it's also the
[09:21] percentage you have in Bitcoin also
[09:23] represents to a certain extent how
[09:26] convinced you are of it. And it would be
[09:28] reckless if you just started your
[09:30] Bitcoin journey to go all in even though
[09:32] you don't understand it fully because
[09:34] maybe then you also mess up custody. You
[09:37] mess up things or you get panic cell
[09:39] because there's like a 20% draw down or
[09:41] something like that. So you're 100 I
[09:44] love that you mentioned that because um
[09:46] even though I'm 100% like I have no fear
[09:49] left. I'm operating on a Z I'm I'm
[09:52] dancing around plus 2,000 minus 2,000
[09:55] bank account to keep it always at zero.
[09:58] Um, but first of all, I can do that
[10:01] because no wife, no family, no uh no
[10:04] business. And I've done all the work
[10:07] since 5 years, 6 years almost in
[10:10] Bitcoin. And I'm really uh confident of
[10:13] that. And I've went through the uh
[10:15] 16,000 to 69,000 to 16,000 again cycles
[10:19] and and I did not sell and and I
[10:21] actually bought
[10:22] more. But that's not for everyone. And
[10:25] that's a very small amount of of people
[10:27] that actually go through that and people
[10:29] have to be confident of it and and not
[10:30] just jump into that. And that's what we
[10:33] tell you know our clients some people we
[10:35] actually was just speaking to a a member
[10:37] of our own team yesterday and he was
[10:39] saying that you know he's been working
[10:40] really hard and he you know it's life's
[10:43] kind of tough and difficult to get ahead
[10:45] financially and he was asking more and
[10:46] more about Bitcoin which of course I
[10:48] welcomed and he said well how much
[10:50] should I allocate to Bitcoin? And I'm
[10:51] like, well, how many hours have you
[10:52] spent studying it? Because if it's 100
[10:54] hours, then I would say up to 10%. If
[10:56] it's a,000 hours, then you can go all
[10:57] in. So, if you haven't spent 100 hours,
[11:00] you're going to get kicked out. Like you
[11:02] said, the last thing I want is someone
[11:03] to get into Bitcoin. And when it's, you
[11:05] know, it's a volatile asset. So, when it
[11:07] spikes down, like we've all been
[11:08] through, just like you described, the
[11:10] last thing I want this guy to do is sell
[11:12] it. So, you know what? If you spent a
[11:14] 100 hours listening to podcast, Robin,
[11:16] like yours, and reading different books,
[11:18] then I would say you can allocate up to
[11:19] 10%. If you spent 1,000 hours, then you
[11:21] know, have at it, put in 100%. And
[11:23] that's where we need to get people to.
[11:25] But we were talking about this a little
[11:26] bit earlier is that the problem with
[11:28] most people when I talk to them about
[11:30] Bitcoin is that they don't have a
[11:31] definition of money because they will
[11:34] ask this guy on our team was also saying
[11:36] he was speaking to some friends and we
[11:37] don't we don't stop talking about
[11:39] Bitcoin in our business. So, he was then
[11:42] talking to some friends about Bitcoin
[11:43] and they were challenging him a little
[11:45] bit and he was asking for ways to
[11:46] describe what Bitcoin is. And I said,
[11:48] "Well, it's difficult to describe what
[11:50] Bitcoin is to somebody when they don't
[11:52] themselves know what money
[11:54] is." Like, ask them, "What is money? How
[11:57] are you defining money?" because that's
[12:00] the starting point of the discussion
[12:01] that I'll usually have with people
[12:03] because the answer sometimes like the
[12:05] most advanced answer I will get is
[12:07] usually something around well when the
[12:10] dollar and they're referring to the
[12:12] dollar at this point when the when the
[12:13] dollar was backed by gold I guess that
[12:16] was kind of like money and I said okay
[12:19] let's break that apart a little bit so
[12:21] the the dollar itself wasn't money the
[12:23] thing that was money in that situation
[12:25] was the gold the paper receipts were the
[12:28] dollars to make it more conven
[12:29] convenient, but the money itself was the
[12:32] gold. So, what then are the properties
[12:35] of good money? And and if I can get them
[12:38] to somehow start thinking about the
[12:39] properties of good money, then I can
[12:41] start comparing Bitcoin and showing them
[12:44] the properties of Bitcoin against the
[12:46] properties of gold. But I kind of need
[12:48] to get them into that framework. And I
[12:50] feel like I'm born in 1973. And I feel
[12:53] like anyone that's born in my
[12:55] generation, you know, millennials,
[12:57] Robin, you know, young guys like you,
[13:00] people who are born in the last 50
[13:02] years, they don't know what money
[13:04] is. Like you're born in an era where
[13:07] fiat was the thing. So you have no
[13:10] concept or knowledge of what money is.
[13:13] So when you see good money, when you see
[13:15] beautifully engineered money like
[13:16] Bitcoin, like the most beautiful money
[13:18] that we can ever imagine, they can't
[13:21] recognize it for what it is because they
[13:23] themselves don't know what money is. And
[13:25] it's the hardest thing to get someone to
[13:27] to break down like what are you working
[13:29] for? What are you spending your time and
[13:31] your labor and what are you exchanging
[13:32] your time and your labor for? And they
[13:35] don't even understand it. And I I look
[13:37] at it like this. Do you do you know what
[13:38] Chuck-E-Cheese is or Dave and Busters or
[13:40] like a fairground where you play those
[13:41] games and you get like tokens that come
[13:43] out of the machines? You familiar with
[13:45] that kind of concept? In North America,
[13:47] there's like Chuck-E-Cheese or Dave and
[13:48] Busters. You go and play video games and
[13:50] like you roll balls, you throw the
[13:51] basketball and if you get if you do well
[13:53] at it, you get like tickets or virtual
[13:56] tokens. And I look at the economy today
[14:00] as that that people are spending all
[14:02] this time. They're spending their whole
[14:05] days working for these tokens. And then
[14:08] when you cash out at these places,
[14:09] Robin, just so you know, you go to this
[14:11] little kiosk where you can like take
[14:13] your tokens and get stuff. But you you
[14:16] literally play these games all day.
[14:18] You're sweaty. You're exhausted. And you
[14:20] go to cash out. And for all the effort
[14:23] that you put in, you can usually get
[14:25] like a pencil. You know what I mean?
[14:27] Like that's your grand prize. You know,
[14:28] you spend all day and then you get a
[14:30] pencil and that's that was the reward.
[14:32] And I feel like that's how the economy
[14:35] is today that everyone's working,
[14:37] driving to work, hustling, working hard,
[14:39] trying to produce for their family, but
[14:41] they're earning these things that are
[14:43] worthless. And when they try to go buy
[14:45] stuff with these tokens, these fiat
[14:47] dollars they're working for, they can
[14:49] barely buy the stakes for the barbecue.
[14:51] They can barely pay rent. They can't buy
[14:52] a house. And there's those of us who
[14:55] understand what money is standing on the
[14:58] outside. Just like you're standing on
[14:59] the outside of the fairground with the
[15:01] real money and looking at all the people
[15:02] play. And when they cash out of the
[15:04] fairground, they don't really have that
[15:06] much real money. And I look at the
[15:08] economy today and thinking, "Oh, these
[15:10] people who are playing in the fiat world
[15:11] exclusively, when they cash out, they
[15:13] can't get that much real money." And
[15:15] you're just standing over here on the
[15:16] sidelines kind of saying like, "Hey
[15:17] guys, like there's this real money over
[15:19] here." And if you spend your time
[15:21] accumulating that and saving that,
[15:23] you'll be so far ahead instead of just
[15:26] being caught up in this circus of
[15:28] earning these fiat dollars that are
[15:30] constantly getting debased on you. It
[15:32] would be like going to Dave and Busters
[15:34] thinking that you're going to get, you
[15:35] know, 10,000 tokens so that you can get
[15:37] the skateboard and then right before you
[15:39] go to get the skateboard, they debase
[15:41] the value of the tokens and, you know,
[15:44] you thought you can get the skateboard,
[15:45] but the skateboard's now 20,000 tokens.
[15:48] It's just ridiculous that, you know,
[15:50] this is where people are stuck and it's
[15:52] no fault of their own, but it's it's
[15:54] it's it's unfortunate that that's the
[15:55] state of things. Robin, I've never used
[15:57] that example before, so I don't know if
[15:58] that made any sense to you, but that's
[16:00] how I'm that's how I'm going to start
[16:03] using it with some of my friends.
[16:05] It it makes a lot of sense. And the
[16:08] question because I I never also looked
[16:11] at that comparison but I looked at uh
[16:14] similar ones and the re the let's stick
[16:17] with that example. The thing is always
[16:20] when do people realize that they are
[16:22] sweating all day long and they are
[16:26] working for money that someone else just
[16:28] prints that someone else just do like
[16:31] the the the game developers that just
[16:33] prints the token is basically the
[16:35] central bank. they they don't have to do
[16:36] anything to print those dollars. When do
[16:39] people realize that they use fake money?
[16:42] Because when I talk about
[16:45] uh madeup money, they're like, "Oh, it's
[16:47] so funny. You talk about madeup money
[16:48] and and you use some magic internet uh
[16:51] Bitcoin that is made up." And and I'm
[16:54] like, "No, no, no." Like, but but
[16:55] there's energy and then the proof of
[16:57] work and they can just print it out and
[17:00] there's no one that can print money. It
[17:01] it's really hard for people to grasp how
[17:04] to get out of that mindset because they
[17:06] have been so framed that fiat money is
[17:10] money period. So that that's usually the
[17:12] answer I get. Yeah. And then when people
[17:14] work for it and they can't get ahead,
[17:17] whether they can articulate it or not,
[17:19] there's a certain level of angst or
[17:21] frustration that's created in their
[17:22] lives, whether they're a young person or
[17:24] they're somebody with a family. And then
[17:27] that gets represented in the society
[17:28] when they're talking to their neighbors
[17:30] and they're talking talking to their
[17:31] family. This undercurrent of stress
[17:35] exists because they're spending all
[17:37] their livelihood earning these things
[17:40] that aren't a fair exchange of their
[17:43] time and labor. So they're not able to
[17:45] produce for themselves and their family
[17:47] what they want to produce. And they
[17:49] carry this weight around. And then that
[17:51] weight gets articulated or expressed in
[17:54] the community because the the exchanges
[17:56] between people in the community then
[17:58] have an undercurrent of angst to them.
[18:01] So when two neighbors see each other and
[18:02] they're both slightly struggling,
[18:04] they're not completely joyful or they're
[18:06] not completely happy and they can't come
[18:08] from a place of love. They're coming
[18:09] from a place of lack of scarcity.
[18:11] Everyone's trying to grab for more. And
[18:13] so it produces whether people understand
[18:15] this or not it's in society or in your
[18:18] local community it produces a a a
[18:21] undercurrent of fear of scarcity of lack
[18:25] instead of a place of abundance and love
[18:28] and
[18:29] helpfulness. And if we can get people to
[18:31] save in a good money it changes the the
[18:35] very base of society because people are
[18:38] acting or coming from a place of
[18:40] abundance. you can help your neighbor
[18:42] neighbor. You can be charitable. You
[18:44] have enough for your family so that you
[18:46] can give to other people more willingly.
[18:49] So it it really changes all of society.
[18:51] And because we have a fiat dollar the
[18:53] way we have it, there's there's
[18:54] elections going on in Canada right now.
[18:56] And the elections are I've never seen
[18:57] elections so hotly contested in Canada.
[18:59] Like Canadians generally don't go out to
[19:02] vote. This is a huge election in Canada
[19:04] happening right now. And a lot of people
[19:06] are are going to vote for the very thing
[19:10] that is causing the problems that they
[19:12] are experiencing. This is something Jeff
[19:13] Booth talks about all the time is that
[19:15] you have a bunch of Canadians who
[19:17] housing prices here, Robin, are insane.
[19:19] Like on the on the outskirts of Toronto
[19:20] to get a nice single family home, you're
[19:22] talking about a million bucks. You know,
[19:24] like I'm talking a very basic single
[19:28] family home. That's a some in some areas
[19:30] that's not even a single family home. It
[19:31] might be a town home for a million
[19:32] dollars. You know, it's not uncommon to
[19:34] get a home here for 1.5, 2,2.5, $3
[19:38] million. And people can't afford all of
[19:40] this. So, the elections are coming.
[19:42] They're going to vote for the
[19:43] politicians who are going to print more
[19:45] money because they're running under
[19:47] under a platform that they're going to
[19:48] build more houses for Canadians. The
[19:51] government can't build any more houses.
[19:52] They don't have savings. So, they're
[19:54] going to print more money, debase the
[19:56] currency further, which is going to
[19:58] create the price of assets and the price
[20:00] of groceries will increase because of
[20:02] that. But Canadians are going to vote
[20:04] for that and it's going to perpetuate
[20:06] the problem even further. What Bitcoin
[20:08] introduces, as many people have
[20:10] explained, it's like the pin that kind
[20:11] of pops everything, right? It's the
[20:13] change that we need where pe, you know,
[20:15] with on a Bitcoin standard as more and
[20:17] more people progress there, we can get
[20:18] out of this cycle that is just pulling
[20:21] everybody down. So, um, anyway, I didn't
[20:24] mean to bring the Canadian elections up
[20:26] into this. just that's what happens at a
[20:29] societal level and it's it's it's
[20:31] unfortunate, sad. It's it's super Yeah,
[20:34] politics is uh it's interesting because
[20:37] uh ever since the Trump election, more
[20:40] more politics came into my podcast for
[20:42] some reason. Uh but it I think it's an
[20:44] interesting topic. Do do you think
[20:46] Bitcoin is
[20:47] political? Some see it completely
[20:49] outside of political. Some say, "Oh,
[20:51] Bitcoin is the most political thing
[20:52] ever." Yeah, I don't see it as political
[20:55] at all. I I to me Bitcoin is um it's
[21:00] almost like a a truth mechanism or uh
[21:03] the way I like to think about it is
[21:06] Bitcoin is bringing order to a chaotic
[21:08] complex ecosystem of humanity
[21:12] and humanity will benefit from order. So
[21:16] Bitcoin is forcing order in a complex
[21:19] system. It's kind of like I believe
[21:22] everyone can elevate their own
[21:23] consciousness by making good decisions.
[21:25] You make good decisions over and over.
[21:27] You live by principle. You live in
[21:28] integrity with your own principles. You
[21:30] make good decisions. And I believe your
[21:33] consciousness elevates. Your energy
[21:34] elevates. You kind of like raise
[21:36] yourself to a higher level. You your the
[21:39] frequency that you give off, Robin, is
[21:40] at like a different level. And I feel
[21:43] like Bitcoin is forcing good decisions
[21:48] on a complex, chaotic system that has
[21:51] not been making good decisions. And it's
[21:53] not political. It's going to elevate
[21:55] humanity. Like it's an inflection point
[21:57] in the history of humanity that is going
[22:00] to elevate humanity to a higher level, a
[22:02] higher frequency. Making better
[22:04] decisions compounded over time is going
[22:06] to produce a a much better society. So,
[22:10] you know, it's it's kind of like this
[22:11] truth mechanism like it it it's it's
[22:14] forcing order and it will affect all of
[22:17] us at an individual level. It'll affect
[22:19] your community. It'll affect your larger
[22:22] state or province or area and it'll
[22:24] affect you know things nationally as
[22:27] well. It'll take time but uh but I think
[22:30] it's like this most beautiful thing in
[22:32] history that is forcing order in a
[22:34] complex system that has been making bad
[22:37] decisions for some time and for whatever
[22:40] reason Bitcoin arrived when it did and
[22:43] it's going to force a lot of good
[22:45] decisions. I love I love that way of of
[22:48] of thinking about it. Do do you see do
[22:51] you see fiat as a soft and modern form
[22:55] of of slavery? Oh yeah. Like Yeah. Yeah.
[22:57] I think Yes. Because I think what fiat
[23:00] has done is
[23:03] removed property rights from us. So for
[23:06] example, like when when money was real
[23:08] and you know the last round of real
[23:10] money might might have been gold when
[23:12] you could custody the gold yourself in
[23:15] your pocket which nobody does anymore or
[23:17] very
[23:18] few. You
[23:20] you that was yours. You owned that
[23:23] property. You weren't like a surf. You
[23:25] weren't a slave to the system. You had
[23:28] that. What property do we have right
[23:30] now? Like if I tell people all the time,
[23:32] my friends who have stocks, I'm like,
[23:34] well, if the banking system has a
[23:35] problem and the bank shut down for 5
[23:38] days, are you going to get your Apple
[23:39] stocks or your Google stocks? Like, do
[23:41] you even get the shares of those
[23:42] companies or do you just have ownership
[23:44] as digits on a screen? Like, if the bank
[23:47] closes down, what property rights do you
[23:49] have? In real estate, what property
[23:51] rights do you really have? Any real
[23:53] estate investor wouldn't be honest
[23:54] unless they admitted you have to pay
[23:55] your property taxes all the time. If you
[23:57] don't pay your property taxes, the
[23:58] government's going to come and take that
[23:59] property from you. So fiat to me just
[24:03] was the last step of
[24:06] making removing property rights almost
[24:09] entirely from you until Bitcoin arrived.
[24:11] It I didn't realize until Bitcoin
[24:13] arrived. I'm like, "Wow, like I actually
[24:16] own this. If I take self-custody of
[24:18] Bitcoin, I own this
[24:21] property. Like I control this property
[24:24] directly. Nobody can change that. You
[24:26] know, I need to have some responsibility
[24:28] about what I'm doing, but I own this.
[24:30] Fiat is like ultimate slavery to me.
[24:34] It's like removed money. I exchange my
[24:37] time and my labor for money, but I don't
[24:39] own the money. I don't own I owned my
[24:42] time and labor. I thought I exchanged it
[24:44] for money. I don't own this money. It
[24:46] ends up in a bank. And if the bank shuts
[24:48] down for a day, I don't even get access
[24:50] to my own money. So, yeah, just a brutal
[24:53] system.
[24:54] I was before Bitcoin, I almost went into
[24:57] re into real estate and I was right at
[25:00] the time where I started uh also paying
[25:02] attention to Bitcoin when there was a
[25:04] Bitcoin podcast that where and I never
[25:05] told that story. It's so funny that
[25:08] where someone said, "Do you really own
[25:11] real estate if you have to pay property
[25:14] tax for just holding it? Do you really
[25:17] own it then?" And I was like, like I
[25:21] don't only like if if I'm forced to pay
[25:24] taxes just for holding it. Um, how good
[25:28] are the property rights of a property of
[25:31] of of the of of that real estate? And it
[25:34] opened my eyes and and Bitcoin actually
[25:36] I don't want to say it like that, but
[25:38] saved me from real estate. Otherwise,
[25:40] otherwise I probably would have been
[25:42] into real estate. Yeah. and and and but
[25:45] and it's so true like to me real estate
[25:46] is better than maybe owning some equity
[25:48] where you don't actually have the share
[25:49] ownership because at least the property
[25:52] is outside of the system in that the
[25:54] tenants are paying you directly for the
[25:56] rent right so okay there might be levels
[25:59] to this but Bitcoin is true property
[26:02] ownership where you self-custody it so
[26:05] it's yet a further level of ownership
[26:07] and not just that real estate and I
[26:09] think Canadians are waking up to this
[26:11] for the first time real estate has
[26:12] jurisdictional risk risk. I think in
[26:15] Europe with kind of like the history of
[26:17] Europe, maybe people have always
[26:19] understood there's been jurisdictional
[26:21] risk in in in in Europe. Like I I
[26:23] explained that my father's from Croatia.
[26:24] That place in Croatia always seems to
[26:26] have some war breakout every, you know,
[26:28] 40 or 50 years. There's always going to
[26:30] be some war going on there and then
[26:31] property rights change around. Whoever
[26:33] took over the land at that point is
[26:34] getting the piece of property. So maybe
[26:36] in in European, you know, the European
[26:40] mind, real estate has had less rights
[26:42] than than maybe here, whereas Canadians
[26:44] think, well, that's my real estate. I
[26:46] own it. I'm like, well, no, I don't I
[26:47] don't really think you do. Like, like
[26:49] you said, if you're not paying the
[26:50] property, right, uh property taxes, do
[26:52] you really own that? And then the
[26:53] jurisdictional risk risk today is that
[26:55] governments are getting, you know, more
[26:58] and more desperate. So, the taxes are
[27:00] changing and there's ideas of taxing
[27:02] Canadian real estate higher and higher
[27:04] and higher. They've floated the idea,
[27:06] then they've pulled it back, but it's
[27:08] been floated out a few times where
[27:09] you're going to be taxed more and maybe
[27:11] eventually taxed on unrealized gains. So
[27:14] now real estate has a jurisdictional
[27:16] risk, whereas Canadians never thought
[27:18] about that before. And I think the
[27:20] reason that you never really even
[27:22] considered that a risk is because there
[27:23] was no
[27:24] alternative. Canadians, we can't open up
[27:27] US bank accounts very easily. Not as a
[27:29] person. It's not easy to open a US bank
[27:31] account. So you're kind of locked into
[27:32] the Canadian system. And the Canadian
[27:33] system has been relatively good compared
[27:36] to the rest of the world. But now with
[27:39] the existence of
[27:41] Bitcoin that is global that you can move
[27:43] around, you can custody it yourself, you
[27:46] kind of have something to to compare the
[27:48] real estate to. And it kind of shows a
[27:51] lot of the flaws that exist in real
[27:53] estate, whether real estate people want
[27:54] to admit it or
[27:56] not. you know, all the positives that
[27:59] real estate had kind of still exist, but
[28:01] they're maybe not quite as great anymore
[28:03] when something like Bitcoin
[28:04] exists. You know, there's a better
[28:07] option uh all of the sun on the table. I
[28:10] hear a lot of Bitcoin actually uh
[28:12] wanting their own home. Uh I see a lot
[28:15] of Bitcoin actually saying, "Oh, I I
[28:18] want to either already have my own home
[28:20] and want to keep it uh and I want it
[28:22] maybe down the road if I because I don't
[28:24] have it right now. Maybe in 10 20 years
[28:27] I want to own my own home maybe and and
[28:29] there have been multiples that said like
[28:32] oh if if I can pay my dream home with I
[28:35] don't know 10% or 20% of my stack I will
[28:37] do that. Is there is there a thing to
[28:40] the owning your own home? Is there as a
[28:42] Bitcoin is that um outside of the
[28:45] emotional reason? I mean, if you want to
[28:47] know emotionally, then there's no
[28:48] discussion around finances. But but does
[28:51] it does it make sense for for Bitcoiners
[28:53] uh either now or down the line to to
[28:56] actually own a home? I think when you
[28:57] have a family or if you want a family,
[29:00] it's nice to be able to have a home that
[29:03] you is yours and you're not renting
[29:06] where somebody you're renting from can
[29:08] kind of tell you to leave. So, I think
[29:11] when you're starting a family, there is
[29:12] it is a nice feeling to call one place
[29:16] your home knowing that it has all the
[29:18] negatives that we mentioned that you
[29:19] have to pay property tax and maintain
[29:21] it. I I do believe that when you when
[29:23] you have a family, you're raising kids
[29:25] or if you want to raise
[29:27] kids, there is
[29:29] some peace of mind that comes from
[29:32] calling one place your home. I think
[29:35] maybe we can move on from the
[29:37] requirement of a mansion or a penthouse
[29:40] condo. I think what Bitcoin does is it
[29:42] maybe uh frames the type of home that
[29:45] somebody would buy in a different light
[29:46] that you know the dream might have been
[29:48] for some people to have this giant home
[29:50] as some status symbol. I think maybe
[29:52] Bitcoin is changing that. So maybe you
[29:54] don't need quite the extravagant home
[29:57] that you once pictured perhaps. But I do
[30:00] think there is some value in in knowing
[30:02] that you there's a place for you to
[30:04] sleep at night that you can call your
[30:06] own. you know, like I I believe that's
[30:09] still the shelter is obviously still a
[30:10] need to call one place your place. I
[30:14] don't know. I think there's still some
[30:16] value there. I just think that maybe,
[30:18] you know, I know what it's done for my
[30:20] what Bitcoin's done for my life is like,
[30:22] you know, we're thinking about possibly
[30:25] moving right now and it's just changed
[30:27] the way I think about it. It's not like,
[30:29] oh, like we don't really need to get
[30:31] this home that maybe the way I thought
[30:33] about it before, like some showpiece
[30:35] home or something that would show like
[30:37] how successful we are or something like
[30:39] that, you know. Um, I didn't really
[30:41] think about that too much before. I
[30:43] didn't really need that, but it's
[30:44] definitely gone
[30:45] now. You know, get me something that has
[30:47] utility, that is functional, maybe is
[30:50] where I want to be, close to some, you
[30:52] know, coffee shops and some cafes with
[30:54] some good people. Um, so it's it's kind
[30:57] of changed it, but I do think there is
[30:58] some value in having a place to to live
[31:01] and kind of sleep at night. Absolutely.
[31:03] What do you think? What do you think,
[31:04] Robin? I I hope because I'm young and
[31:06] I'm 26 now, I hope that Bitcoin has
[31:10] demonetized real estate in the next 10
[31:12] to 20 years so much that when I'm 30,
[31:16] 35, 40, maybe 45, uh that a home is all
[31:21] of a sudden something affordable again,
[31:23] something that you can actually buy,
[31:25] something
[31:28] for for me, real estate is either a
[31:31] business or a consumption good. So you
[31:34] you you you don't buy it to save in in
[31:37] this. It's not a savings vehicle. Yes,
[31:39] bit real estate will always do better
[31:42] than the US dollar, but it will always
[31:44] do worse against Bitcoin. So for me, um
[31:47] I opt in the best money with Bitcoin and
[31:50] uh as a consumption good, I can buy it
[31:53] uh w with my Bitcoin or it's a business.
[31:56] If if you have tenants in there and you
[31:57] have cash flow, then it's it's it's any
[31:59] as any other business where you have to
[32:01] operate it. It's just not a savings
[32:03] device for me. So, I would only buy it
[32:05] if uh it's with a small amount of my
[32:08] stack
[32:09] possible. And I'm aware of it that it's
[32:14] uh it it would the money would have been
[32:16] better in Bitcoin, but I still do it
[32:18] because I want to found my own family in
[32:21] there. I want to have those things. Uh I
[32:24] personally still want that like I want
[32:25] to own my own home. Uh I currently rent.
[32:28] Uh but uh at some point I I do want
[32:31] that. And it's it's it's so funny when
[32:33] when we talk to all Bitcoiners, do they
[32:36] all see okay, Bitcoin is the superior
[32:40] asset, but I still want to have a home
[32:43] uh at the end of the day at some point
[32:44] that there's a lot of people Bitcoiners
[32:46] that never want to own a home, but there
[32:48] are a lot of Bitcoiners that do want to
[32:51] own their own homes. Yeah. I think too
[32:54] just for like I have I have children and
[32:56] it's just nice to be able to say that's
[32:58] our home, you know, like that's I don't
[33:00] know there that that to me there's just
[33:02] kind of like this peace of mind that
[33:03] comes from it like just to have this
[33:05] place that is ours. So and it's still a
[33:08] need. I would like the monetization to
[33:10] come out of it as well. Like when I
[33:11] finished school, I you know, the a
[33:14] starting salary was like coming out of
[33:17] university might have been around
[33:18] $45,000 a year, $50,000 a year if you
[33:21] were lucky. And you could get a on the
[33:22] outskirts of Toronto, you could get a
[33:25] four bedroomedroom home, twocar garage
[33:27] with a driveway up the side, like a
[33:29] suburban home, but fourbedroom and maybe
[33:32] uh you know 2500 ft². I'm not sure how
[33:35] many meters that would be. Um, but a a
[33:37] good size home. You could get it for
[33:40] 250,000. So, you're making 50,000. It's
[33:43] 250,000. It seemed expensive to me at
[33:45] the time, but it was like you could you
[33:47] could kind of sort of handle it. That
[33:49] same home I I've moved since then, but
[33:52] that same home right now sells for about
[33:55] 1.6 million. Okay. It used to be
[33:57] 250,000. So, like this is how many years
[34:00] ago would this be? This is like 25 years
[34:03] ago or so. 26 years ago. um and starting
[34:06] salaries have moved from 45 or 50 to
[34:09] like
[34:11] 5560 coming out of
[34:13] university. So like the home has got you
[34:16] know the monetization of these homes and
[34:18] if and and we map it out against the
[34:20] debasement of the currency and property
[34:22] prices in this area have gone up on a
[34:24] compounded basis from the time I was
[34:26] born at about you know 7% or so
[34:30] compounded the compound annual growth
[34:31] rate of property 7%. Um the M2 money
[34:35] supply in this country is about 8 8%
[34:38] 8.7%. So like they've just been carried
[34:41] forward by the uh the debasement of the
[34:44] currency. It's just completely
[34:46] ridiculous. So people look at real
[34:48] estate as an investment in this country
[34:50] and they don't understand all it is has
[34:52] been a hard asset that hasn't been you
[34:55] can't you couldn't print it. So the only
[34:57] price appreciation really that it got
[34:59] came from the debasement of the
[35:00] currency. It's like the hardest thing
[35:02] for people to understand, right? Um, but
[35:05] yeah, I hope it loses its monetization
[35:07] value as well. And that's just another
[35:09] thing in Bitcoin that will bring it back
[35:10] will will change kind of the culture,
[35:13] the community, the society, people's
[35:15] interactions when it brings it back to
[35:17] the utility value. So someone like
[35:19] yourself, Robin, can like buy a house
[35:21] without separating yourself from all
[35:23] your savings and going into debt for
[35:25] like the next 25 years of your life.
[35:27] Let's take a break for a moment and
[35:30] appreciate the beauty that coin
[35:32] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[35:34] watches. Those watches are the most
[35:37] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[35:40] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[35:43] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[35:46] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[35:49] watch collections. You have the date of
[35:52] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[35:55] there and of course also the block
[35:57] height and which epoch we are currently
[36:00] in. I love the level of detail they put
[36:03] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[36:06] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[36:08] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[36:11] love those watches so so much. And now
[36:14] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[36:17] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[36:19] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[36:21] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[36:23] first way is you put it on a hardware
[36:25] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[36:28] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[36:31] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[36:34] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[36:37] if you check out the link in the
[36:39] description, you even get 5% off if you
[36:42] use the code Robin. And the second way
[36:44] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[36:47] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[36:51] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[36:54] They will personalize for you a
[36:56] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[36:58] your individual situation. They will
[37:01] show you how you can secure your own
[37:04] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[37:06] enough. You also have to keep all your
[37:08] devices secure. One topic that is
[37:10] overlooked often is the inheritance
[37:13] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[37:16] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[37:18] a plan for that in place already? And
[37:21] last but not least, if you're in a
[37:23] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[37:25] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[37:28] that, head over to the
[37:32] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[37:34] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[37:37] be for the first time ever speaking at
[37:40] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[37:42] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[37:45] really looking forward to seeing all of
[37:47] you there. You can get your ticket in
[37:50] the link down in the description of
[37:52] Bitcoin Prague and very important use
[37:54] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[37:58] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[38:00] there. I saw this amazing pyramid where
[38:02] it was a finite asset. So with a hard
[38:05] cap, then the second one was with scarce
[38:08] asset. So gold real estate that would be
[38:11] scarce um because there there's more
[38:14] coming but it's it's it's there's some
[38:16] proof of work to to real estate there's
[38:18] some proof of work to to gold and then
[38:20] there's like infinite assets with with
[38:22] US dollar and and all the fiat
[38:24] currencies and I said make the hardest
[38:26] asset your standard but it's okay to own
[38:30] some scarce asset like if you want to
[38:32] own I don't know a collectible car
[38:36] uh something like your own home Maybe
[38:39] you have some small gold bars at home.
[38:41] That there's nothing wrong with that.
[38:43] But make the make the the finer the the
[38:46] the the hardest asset of them all. Make
[38:49] that your default. I think that that's
[38:51] how I how I look at it. But I I do I do
[38:54] want to own own some home. Yeah. Yeah. I
[38:58] think you're lucky. You're coming into
[39:00] the time like, you know, I remember the
[39:02] late 90s when the tech bubble was going.
[39:04] In the late 90s, people would register
[39:06] URLs like, you know, I I I'll never
[39:09] forget millionaire.com. Like when I was
[39:11] working for a tech company out of the
[39:12] US, I was in Canada, and they they
[39:14] registered the URL millionaire.com. And
[39:16] it was going to go public on the stock
[39:18] market. And I remember asking my friend,
[39:20] I'm like, well, why would we try and
[39:22] chase this IPO? Like, why should we
[39:23] invest in this IPO? And he said, Tom,
[39:24] you don't understand. This is where all
[39:27] the millionaires are going to go to
[39:30] millionaire.com. Like that was the whole
[39:31] business case for millionaire.com. like
[39:34] they were the millionaires were going to
[39:35] go to this website. I don't know what
[39:37] they were going to do there, but this
[39:38] was the business case and like it all
[39:41] kind of crashed down. The tech bubble
[39:42] kind of crashed um in the early 2000s
[39:45] and like Oracle had layoffs. I remember
[39:47] people seeing like people walk out and
[39:49] kind of you know just it was it was just
[39:52] all so ridiculous. But I saw that trend
[39:54] of like the internet evolving through
[39:56] that era and some great stuff came out
[39:58] of it. Um, and then there was another
[40:00] trend where, you know, we were always on
[40:02] our desktop, but then the mobile phone
[40:04] really took off as this trend. And if
[40:07] you could look at any of those trends
[40:09] and participate in them, you could
[40:11] really make some great gains for
[40:13] yourself. Like if you bought Amazon in
[40:15] the late 1990s, early 2000s and stuck
[40:17] with it, you didn't realize how it was
[40:20] going to like digitize all of retail and
[40:23] change supply chain supply chains all
[40:25] around the world. If you watched the
[40:27] mobile change and jumped onto the iPhone
[40:30] when it came out, you could have made
[40:31] some great gains as everything went
[40:33] mobile. You happen to be at this era
[40:35] where there's this other great trend
[40:37] that's happening. And I don't know how
[40:38] many more great trends I'll see in my
[40:40] lifetime where Bitcoin has come and it's
[40:42] literally deconstructing the entire old
[40:45] fin global financial system that was
[40:47] very it was global but it was also very
[40:49] regionalized and it's producing a
[40:51] completely digital pure free market that
[40:54] is global and you're getting to ride
[40:57] that wave Robin like you're basically at
[41:00] this beautiful moment in history where
[41:03] you're going to ride something that is
[41:05] going to take the entire old financial
[41:09] system and replace it and you're at the
[41:12] right place at the right time. So I
[41:14] really think 20 years from now you'll
[41:16] look back on this moment and just say
[41:17] wow how lucky was I even though real
[41:19] estate prices are still high like you're
[41:21] at this moment like if you think about
[41:23] the existing traditional banking system
[41:26] we have we've had for the last what 20
[41:29] years at least since China came into the
[41:31] world trade organization so I would say
[41:33] 25 years 30 years of you know global
[41:37] trade but on top of global trade we had
[41:39] regional
[41:40] banking so in Canada you like I
[41:43] mentioned you could only really get
[41:44] access to Canadian banking in the
[41:46] Canadian dollar, right? It it wasn't
[41:48] easy to get I couldn't really get a euro
[41:51] bank account very easily. I couldn't
[41:53] really do business as an individual with
[41:55] you very easily. We would have to like
[41:57] try to wire money. I would have to try
[41:59] and change my Canadian dollars to euros.
[42:02] You know, I I get it over to you. They
[42:04] would hold the money for some period.
[42:05] So, the banking, even though there was
[42:07] global trade happening, there was
[42:09] regional banking. We're now
[42:11] transitioning back to more regional
[42:13] trade zones. You see what the US is
[42:15] doing with tariffs. You can see the
[42:17] world is kind of going back to some sort
[42:19] of re the eur Europe is talking about
[42:21] changes. North America is talking about
[42:23] changes. America is definitely talking
[42:25] about changes. We're going almost back
[42:27] to regional trade areas. We'll see if
[42:29] that works out or not. But global
[42:31] banking and no one is prepared for that.
[42:34] We have a new system with Bitcoin that
[42:37] is introducing global free market
[42:40] banking to all of
[42:41] us. And on top of that banking, you have
[42:45] things like artificial intelligence that
[42:48] is universally accessible to everyone.
[42:52] So the world is shifting from like this
[42:54] weird situation where we were kind of
[42:56] compartmentalized in our banking and the
[42:58] way we exchange value to this new world
[43:00] that is global banking with global
[43:03] artificial intelligence where you and I
[43:05] you can start a business. The same
[43:06] business I could start here. You could
[43:08] start where you are. Somebody in Brazil
[43:11] can start it. Somebody in Argentina can
[43:12] start it. The next 10 years is going to
[43:15] catch a lot of people off guard, but
[43:17] mostly the regionalized banking centers
[43:19] and the powers of the bee in North
[43:21] America. So Toronto has a is a huge
[43:23] financial hub for Canada. The these
[43:26] these financial institutions are going
[43:27] to be so caught off guard over the next
[43:30] 10 years as global banking starts
[43:32] sucking value out of this old system,
[43:34] putting it into a new system. And the
[43:36] money that transfers from the old system
[43:38] into the new system, it's not going
[43:40] back. You and I, as we transfer more of
[43:43] our time and our energy and more of our
[43:44] fiat from one world into a new world,
[43:47] it's not like you or I are thinking
[43:49] we're putting the money back. So, this
[43:51] new world is going to have more of the
[43:53] value. And the people in that world that
[43:54] have more of the value are going to make
[43:56] the decisions on where they invest, what
[43:57] businesses they bring. So, it's this is
[44:00] going to flourish over here and people
[44:02] are going to deny it and fight it. And
[44:03] the people in the old world are slowly
[44:05] going to die off just like the post
[44:06] office died off to email, just like the
[44:09] local retailer died off to
[44:11] Amazon. The local regional banks are
[44:13] going to die off to this new digital
[44:15] system. It's going to be quite
[44:17] fascinating this next 10 years. And what
[44:19] kind of gives me a lot of hope and
[44:21] encouragement, there's people like you
[44:22] out there who are going to ride the wave
[44:24] and you're going to be the decision
[44:25] makers and the stewards of this new
[44:28] world. It's pretty encouraging. Like
[44:31] it's pretty exciting.
[44:33] That's uh I'm getting bullish when I
[44:35] listen to you. Yeah. Well, it's it's
[44:38] just it's a fascinating time. Like the
[44:41] all of the value like how much value am
[44:43] I really going to put back into the old
[44:45] world that is in Bitcoin? I don't really
[44:48] know. Like I'm just going to take a
[44:49] little bit here and there maybe out of
[44:50] some need, but I'm not going to put uh
[44:52] I'm not going to put a lot of it back.
[44:54] It's it's kind of like when email came
[44:57] out and we were able to communicate
[44:59] through TCPIP. I remember people telling
[45:02] me, "Well, Tom, legal documents are
[45:05] never going to be sent via email.
[45:07] They're never, Tom, settle down. Legal
[45:10] documents will always be sent in the
[45:11] mail. You're always going to need a a
[45:13] signature on them." So, this email thing
[45:15] is kind of cute, but it's not for real
[45:18] business. Like, Robin, I really had
[45:19] people tell me this in the early 2000s.
[45:21] And as a tech guy, I remember thinking,
[45:23] "Really? That's kind of like weird. Why
[45:24] won't you just like attach this thing to
[45:26] an email? I'll sign it. I'll print it
[45:29] off and sign it." Now you can do digital
[45:30] signatures. They'll print it off and
[45:31] sign it, take pictures, send it back to
[45:33] you. Now that's done all the time. But
[45:35] at that time, people couldn't see it.
[45:38] Now in in the real estate world here in
[45:40] this area anyway, 99% of everything is
[45:43] done digitally. Everything left that old
[45:46] world. Canada Post doesn't handle any of
[45:49] that type of communication
[45:51] anymore. Why would the banking system be
[45:53] any different?
[45:55] Why would why would that happen with
[45:57] TCPIP and the post office and email and
[46:00] not the same lack of use of an old
[46:03] banking system happen? It's going to be
[46:06] the same thing. As soon as I am able to
[46:09] transfer you funds through Bitcoin, why
[46:12] would I ever go back to the to the
[46:14] banking system? And for even the people
[46:16] that want to hold on longer, there's
[46:19] there's wallets like Aqua Wallet. Have
[46:21] you played around with Aqua Wallet very
[46:23] much? Not enough. No, no. Okay. Aqua
[46:25] wallet has like USDT. It has Tether
[46:27] built into it. So like if somebody
[46:30] didn't want to use Bitcoin for whatever
[46:32] reason and they wanted to transfer value
[46:33] in US dollars, like let's say you there
[46:36] had an Aqua wallet, I could just send
[46:38] you USDT. Not that we would want to as
[46:41] Bitcoiners, but that's more value that
[46:43] has been extracted out of the old
[46:45] banking system and put into the new
[46:46] system.
[46:48] To me, that's just going to further
[46:52] accelerate the evolution of Bitcoin and
[46:55] the amount of value in the world that
[46:57] Bitcoin holds. It just seems inevitable
[47:00] to me. Will there any will there be any
[47:02] banks? Like when you describe it like
[47:05] that, uh you kind of get to thinking of
[47:08] what is the real value of of having a
[47:11] bank. Then yeah, maybe you want some
[47:13] partner that helps you custody your
[47:15] bitcoin which is I don't know cars are
[47:18] unchained and and and those kind of
[47:19] things or service provider like the uh
[47:21] the bitcoin way that that helps you with
[47:23] that but the banking in in the
[47:26] traditional sense is is is that then the
[47:30] old banks are I I we get into I get into
[47:32] this debate with my brother all the time
[47:34] because he thinks I'm being too too much
[47:36] a Bitcoiner when I say this but um yeah
[47:39] the the old banks why would you need
[47:41] them? I think there's new banks emerging
[47:42] right now like strategy MSTR is going to
[47:46] be a new bank. There's no doubt. To me,
[47:48] we are witnessing the emergence of a new
[47:50] bank that is going to produce financial
[47:52] services to different corporations. I
[47:54] think Tether, the way it's behaving
[47:56] right now is morphing into a new bank.
[47:59] So, I think you're going to see new
[48:01] financial institutions and I think
[48:03] they're already rising, just nobody's
[48:05] identifying them. and the old ones that
[48:07] just offer like what am I getting from
[48:10] these old banks? I get to deposit some
[48:12] fiat. I have to pay $50 to send a wire.
[48:16] What? Like I transfer money from this
[48:19] old bank into like a trading account to
[48:21] be able to like buy some Apple shares or
[48:23] something like what's the what what
[48:26] value are they really off when when
[48:27] Bitcoin in this new ecosystem exists?
[48:30] What does it do they offer me? So I I
[48:33] think there's going to be banking. I
[48:34] think there's always going to be banking
[48:35] because there's always going to be a
[48:36] need for somebody to borrow. Um there's
[48:40] always going to be collateral being
[48:41] used. Bitcoin will be the the best
[48:43] collateral. There's always going to be
[48:44] those needs. So yeah, I think banking is
[48:47] going to exist. I just think the old
[48:48] fiat banks don't see this coming. Like I
[48:51] I just think they're they're going to be
[48:53] sideswiped. I really feel like companies
[48:55] like strategy with with Michael Sailor,
[48:58] they've opened up this black hole into
[49:00] the financial system that is sucking up
[49:02] all the value into the new system. So
[49:04] now Bitcoin is sucking up all the value
[49:06] in two ways. Bitcoiners like me and you
[49:08] who are going into self-custody and
[49:10] we're exchanging our fiat for Bitcoin
[49:12] and choosing not really to go back
[49:14] unless we absolutely need to take some
[49:16] of our savings and go back out of
[49:19] necessity. But you and I, if I see you
[49:21] somewhere at a Bitcoin conference and I,
[49:23] you know, you buy me lunch and I pay you
[49:26] back, I'm just going to probably pay you
[49:27] back in straight Bitcoin. Why am I going
[49:29] to go through some weird thing to get
[49:30] you get euros and that kind of stuff?
[49:33] So, Bitcoin has opened up a black hole
[49:35] to suck out the value from the old
[49:37] system to the new system at the
[49:38] individual level. And now there's
[49:40] companies like Strategy who are opening
[49:42] up a black hole, sucking out all the
[49:44] value from the old financial system into
[49:46] this new system. And the old banks don't
[49:49] even see this happening yet. But you see
[49:50] the rise and and Michael Sailor will
[49:52] even talk about strategy being a Bitcoin
[49:56] treasury. And to me, that's just the
[49:58] emergence of the new system. It's kind
[50:00] of like when Amazon came out with
[50:01] retail, people were like, "Oh my gosh,
[50:02] Tom, I'm never going to buy a couch from
[50:04] Amazon. I'll never buy a couch from
[50:07] Amazon. I'll never buy a pair of jeans
[50:09] from Amazon. I want to try them on. I'll
[50:11] never buy shoes from Amazon. I need to
[50:13] try them on." Now, what does buy
[50:14] everyone buy from Amazon? Absolutely
[50:16] everything.
[50:18] And I feel like the same thing's going
[50:20] to happen with Bitcoin in these new
[50:22] banks. People are looking at strategy
[50:23] right now think, "Well, I don't really
[50:24] know what it is. I don't know what the
[50:26] guy's doing." I think, you know, he's
[50:29] crazy. And really, what I see is the
[50:31] emergence of a brand new financial
[50:33] institution that is continuing to offer
[50:36] new products to the market and is going
[50:38] to be one of the new banks going
[50:40] forward. So, yeah, it's it's wild.
[50:44] It's it's awesome when you've seen the
[50:47] internet adoption because I haven't
[50:49] obviously um what have you learned from
[50:52] what you've seen there especially as you
[50:54] also worked at Oracle what you have
[50:56] learned from the internet adoption how
[50:58] fast it's going how people react to
[51:01] certain things as you already said with
[51:03] Amazon nobody will buy there obviously
[51:05] they buy everything from Amazon that
[51:07] you're now seeing already starting with
[51:09] Bitcoin and what are you learning from
[51:12] from
[51:13] Yeah, the I'm glad you brought that up
[51:15] because the biggest thing is I'll never
[51:17] forget when I was at Oracle. It was like
[51:20] 2004 and um the internet adoption was
[51:23] already really really strong. I was in a
[51:25] tech company and there was a company
[51:26] called Netswuite which was a bunch of
[51:28] guys from Oracle who left to start an
[51:31] accounting software as a service
[51:34] business where companies could put all
[51:36] their accounting into the cloud into the
[51:39] internet. And at the time that was
[51:41] almost blasphemy because people thought,
[51:43] "Oh my gosh, like my accounting
[51:46] information is very precious to me as a
[51:48] company. I will have a computer room."
[51:49] All businesses, Robin, used to have a
[51:51] computer room. Okay? It didn't matter
[51:53] what size of business you were. Once the
[51:55] digital age came, you had this computer
[51:56] room. You had some servers in there that
[51:58] handled your email. You had to hire some
[51:59] IT guy. Even if you were selling shoes,
[52:01] you're like, "Oh my gosh, like I need to
[52:02] hire some IT guy to run my email." and
[52:04] the servers were in your office in a
[52:06] closet and somebody would go in there
[52:09] and monkey around with the email and you
[52:11] know set up your servers for your
[52:13] Microsoft Access database that would
[52:15] keep your accounting information there
[52:17] and handle your email. So when Netswuite
[52:19] in 2004 already existed, I was switching
[52:23] from Oracle to Netswuite. It was all
[52:24] Oracle guys that went that started
[52:26] Netswuite and I got recruited over there
[52:28] and I remember telling my manager at
[52:30] Oracle um this is late 2004 maybe early
[52:35] 2005. I said oh my gosh there's this
[52:37] great opportunity I'm going to go to
[52:38] Netswuite because all of the information
[52:42] it's very clear to me it's leaving the
[52:43] old technology and it's going into the
[52:46] cloud. Nobody's going to have these
[52:48] computer servers in their offices
[52:49] anymore. It's all going to be on the
[52:51] internet. And he looked at me, he said,
[52:53] 'Are you crazy? Nobody's going to do
[52:55] that. No businesses are going to put
[52:57] their accounting information, the very
[52:59] lifeblood of their organization into the
[53:01] cloud. Everybody's going to always have
[53:04] that themselves. That's just too
[53:05] precious. I remember looking at him
[53:07] think, are you don't you already do
[53:08] online banking? Like, are you not
[53:10] already doing online bank? This is just
[53:12] the extension of that. So, I left. I
[53:14] went to Netswuite. two years later. So
[53:17] 24 months later, Netswuite goes public
[53:19] on the New York Stock Exchange for $1
[53:22] billion
[53:23] valuation. So this is somebody at Oracle
[53:26] who was in the tech industry who could
[53:29] not see the emergence of a brand new
[53:32] service and how people be people's
[53:35] behavior would change and they would
[53:37] just go into this new system out of
[53:40] convenience. And then it became obvious
[53:42] when it went public, everybody was like,
[53:43] "Oh, okay. I guess this is the new way."
[53:46] And I feel like that's the same way with
[53:47] Bitcoin today where everybody looks at
[53:50] Bitcoin today and it's a little clunky
[53:52] still, even though it's gotten a lot
[53:53] better since I got in 5 years ago. You
[53:55] know,
[53:56] self-custody, you know, you got to get
[53:58] these co hardware wallets and it's like
[54:00] kind of like a little clunky. But then
[54:02] you got these new apps that are coming
[54:04] out now and we mentioned Aqua already,
[54:06] which is like quite beautiful. Aqua has
[54:08] Bitcoin. It has an integrated lightning
[54:11] and liquid. You can make lightning
[54:12] payments right from Aqua. You can change
[54:15] Bitcoin to USDT if you want or better
[54:17] yet USDT right into Bitcoin right inside
[54:20] the app. And why would I want anything?
[54:22] This is now becoming like a full banking
[54:24] app. Now, as a Canadian, I get access to
[54:26] US dollar exposure if I so choose. I get
[54:30] to save in Bitcoin all in this one
[54:32] thing. And I feel like I'm seeing the
[54:34] tech trends all over again where nobody
[54:36] can see the bank. Everyone's looking at
[54:38] the existing traditional banks think,
[54:39] "Oh my god, they're never really going
[54:40] to be. They're they're so big in Canada.
[54:43] Canada has like five big banks, Robin."
[54:45] And everyone's like, "Oh, nothing will
[54:46] ever happen to them." And I'm just
[54:47] thinking, "Are you guys kidding me?
[54:49] These things are under threat and they
[54:51] don't know it." So, it's like the same
[54:53] trends in tech that are happening all
[54:55] over again. And they happen kind of
[54:57] slowly. You know, the whole meme of
[54:58] slowly then suddenly, it's like the
[55:00] exact same thing happening. And I think
[55:02] the suddenly moment maybe because I'm a
[55:05] Bitcoiner I would I'll say this is like
[55:07] I think it's sooner than later. It's so
[55:09] interesting. I think we people don't get
[55:12] exponential growth and people don't get
[55:14] uh the new thing there. And it's also
[55:16] interesting how the new thing is under
[55:20] complete how should I say that if you
[55:23] say to someone oh like Bitcoin is that
[55:25] idea that Bitcoin is that idea and if
[55:27] you go down the the the the orange
[55:29] pilling lane there are things coming up
[55:31] of like oh quantum computing nobody asks
[55:35] that about their banking account if they
[55:37] are quantum resistant but they're asking
[55:39] that about the new thing. So it's always
[55:41] interesting how the new thing has to be
[55:44] perfect and is still getting critical
[55:46] points wherever they can find even a
[55:49] small thing and the old system never
[55:51] gets questioned if if it actually makes
[55:54] sense to to do business and to do ways
[55:57] that way and you probably have seen that
[55:59] with the internet with uh like hundreds
[56:01] of examples. It seems Yeah, it seems so
[56:03] obvious. And then like for example like
[56:06] I'm I'm likely going to go to the one of
[56:08] the Bitcoin conferences and let's say I
[56:10] I bump into you. We mentioned Braum
[56:12] earlier and Leon. Imagine us four see
[56:15] each other and for whatever reason we
[56:18] have to exchange some money between each
[56:20] other. Are we really going to exchange
[56:22] money through the old system? Or now do
[56:25] you have four people from four different
[56:27] countries going to exchange value
[56:29] between each other on a universal global
[56:33] standard called Bitcoin? A network of
[56:37] nodes maintained by thousands of people
[56:39] all over the world, protected by energy
[56:42] with miners coming online, I feel like
[56:45] by the thousands every day. We're going
[56:47] to use this new beautiful network to
[56:50] exchange value between the four of us.
[56:52] And it seems so obvious like why would
[56:54] I? We are from four different countries.
[56:57] Can you imagine we tried to exchange
[56:59] value between each other if we all went
[57:01] out to lunch at a Bitcoin conference in
[57:03] each other's local currency? Okay. Like
[57:05] Robin, how much do I owe you? Actually,
[57:06] you guys would all be on the euro now.
[57:08] You're all centralized on the euro. But
[57:11] can you imagine that? like you know Leon
[57:13] paying me in Canadian dollars and then
[57:15] me taking the Canadian dollars and
[57:17] changing them back to euros to pay you
[57:19] Robin like it who would do that and to
[57:23] us four it would just be so natural of
[57:24] course we're just going to use
[57:26] Bitcoin and I that's why I just don't
[57:28] think that people get it like us four
[57:30] are not going back we're just going to
[57:33] keep using Bitcoin and then I have
[57:35] children who have been in Bitcoin now
[57:38] like my son is turning 23 my daughter's
[57:40] 19 they've been in Bitcoin now for 5
[57:41] years as well. So that is just like my
[57:44] daughter's 19. She's been saving in
[57:46] Bitcoin since she was
[57:47] 14. Like she only knows really big. Like
[57:50] she asked me I think at one point I
[57:52] think she was like turning 16. She's
[57:54] like, "Dad, like why do some of my
[57:55] friends have these bank accounts?
[57:59] You know what I mean?" So like it's
[58:01] already happening and just people don't
[58:03] see
[58:04] it. So it just seems like a foregone
[58:06] conclusion to me. Um, and and I also
[58:10] think like some of my friends who are
[58:11] looking at Bitcoin will look at it and
[58:13] they'll say, "Well, Tom, when's the
[58:14] moment that Bitcoin really takes off?"
[58:16] And I'm like, "No, no, like it's
[58:17] happening now." Like I had to lease a
[58:20] car or buy a car for our family a year
[58:23] and a half ago. And I remember looking
[58:24] at how much Bitcoin it would cost me and
[58:27] I thought, "Oh my gosh, I don't want to
[58:28] exchange my Bitcoin for this car. I'm
[58:30] going to lease this car. I don't want to
[58:32] give." At the time, I think it was going
[58:33] to be like a one and a half Bitcoin. And
[58:36] I'm like, "Holy smokes, I don't want to
[58:37] exchange one and a half Bitcoin for this
[58:39] car. I'm just gonna lease this thing."
[58:41] Today, that car is worth the same car.
[58:44] It's worth
[58:46] about six of a
[58:49] Bitcoin. So, I was trying to explain to
[58:51] my friends, when you save in Bitcoin,
[58:53] the world is changing right now. Life is
[58:55] getting cheaper for for Bitcoiners right
[58:58] now. So, there's no moment like I was
[59:01] always waiting for a moment when Bitcoin
[59:02] would win. And I'm like, "No, what you
[59:05] have to understand, just like the way
[59:07] the internet businesses kind of
[59:09] sideswiped a lot of like offline
[59:11] businesses, Bitcoin is changing the
[59:13] money system right now, people who are
[59:16] Bitcoiners are their purchasing power is
[59:18] getting ahead right now. There's no
[59:19] moment. The moment is now. It's
[59:21] happening every day and it's
[59:23] compounding. So, you're either
[59:25] participating in this new network or
[59:27] you're choosing not to, but the network
[59:29] itself doesn't
[59:30] care and it's happening right now.
[59:34] It's a really good point. It's also when
[59:37] you think about in Bitcoin and I'm
[59:39] curious uh how this has changed your
[59:41] thinking because I'm just too young. Um
[59:44] I started with Bitcoin in uh when I was
[59:47] 21 years old. So I've never really
[59:49] thought about money and assets before a
[59:52] lot. Uh but uh Bitcoin came for you a
[59:55] little bit later in your life. How has
[59:58] Bitcoin changed your thinking of wealth
[60:01] preservation, wealth building and and
[60:03] and kind of getting now we would say
[60:06] stacking SS but that was not not not
[60:10] previously there.
[60:12] I think the biggest thing for whatever
[60:14] reason I was telling my kids I'm like
[60:15] I'm not leaving anything for you. You
[60:17] need to suffer. You need to go through
[60:19] it. You need to go through it. You just
[60:22] need to suffer and you you through
[60:25] suffering you learn a lot of lessons
[60:26] about yourself and life and that's it.
[60:29] So don't look at your parents as like
[60:31] we're leaving some real estate or some
[60:33] business stuff for you. You need to go
[60:34] and earn it for yourself. And for
[60:36] whatever reason had to shift with
[60:38] Bitcoin where I thought wow like I might
[60:44] be able to really do something for my
[60:46] family if I can build up a family
[60:49] treasury of Bitcoin. And I would love to
[60:53] be able
[60:54] to pass that on to the next generation.
[60:58] And I and I I I'm I was thinking like
[61:01] why did my thinking change? And I think
[61:03] it changed because with the old
[61:07] properties and businesses, you have to
[61:09] deal with estate taxes and changing
[61:12] ownership of the corporations and like
[61:14] it's a lot of pain to just move an
[61:17] assets that you've earned from one
[61:20] generation to the next generation. Like
[61:22] there is a lot of planning. You know,
[61:24] there's life insurance policies that can
[61:26] help with that. You got to set all of
[61:28] this up. And I I guess for whatever
[61:29] reason, maybe I just didn't want to deal
[61:31] with it. Even though I was setting it up
[61:33] as as well as I could, maybe part of me
[61:35] was just like, uh, you got to pay all
[61:37] these taxes to the government and you
[61:39] got to do all this stuff. Like, you know
[61:41] what? Just forget it. I'm I'm actually
[61:43] saving you by not dealing with this. How
[61:46] about that? So, maybe there was this
[61:48] weird thing where I was trying to save
[61:50] them from the hassle of dealing with
[61:53] everything.
[61:54] Then Bitcoin comes and it's just so
[61:56] beautifully
[61:58] simple. It's just this easy thing like
[62:02] you have some Bitcoin and you know when
[62:04] I pass away my family can get some
[62:06] Bitcoin and I'm not trying to say to
[62:08] penny pay any of the taxes locally on
[62:10] the state and stuff but it's just very
[62:13] simple. But when you're transferring
[62:15] property ownership and there's tenants
[62:18] and properties that you have to deal
[62:19] with that you might be don't want to
[62:21] deal with. there's companies that are
[62:22] running with payroll to meet like if
[62:25] this is the way value was stored and now
[62:28] I'm almost giving you a burden like hey
[62:31] here here you go here's all this mess of
[62:33] stuff good
[62:35] luck but now with Bitcoin I can pass
[62:39] some real monetary value on that is so
[62:42] simple and so beautiful and so clean
[62:45] that it just changed my thinking on my
[62:47] own estate planning and my own thinking
[62:49] for my family. It really had a big
[62:51] impact on me. The there's the there we
[62:55] come to the point back where when you
[62:58] give real estate to someone, it's more
[62:59] like giving a business away. And I mean
[63:02] outside if it's just one home, but if
[63:04] it's like developments and and
[63:05] properties and a lot of things. So you
[63:07] give a business away and you have to
[63:09] think about, oh, how do I give a
[63:11] business to someone else? He has to be
[63:13] capable of of leading that business and
[63:15] probably has to be already there. uh
[63:18] when you're still alive and you have a
[63:19] transition period and stuff like that
[63:21] and we we've seen example where it goes
[63:23] really well. We have se seen example
[63:25] where doesn't go well but with Bitcoin
[63:27] it's just a savings account. You can
[63:30] give it to someone that he doesn't need
[63:33] to know how to run a Bitcoin business.
[63:36] Uh he he just has to to know a few
[63:38] simple things how to to custody the the
[63:41] Bitcoin. So I love I love the point.
[63:43] Yeah. And and I think something else is
[63:45] just changing is like for my generation,
[63:48] you when you talk to people my age, it's
[63:51] all there's a lot of discussion of like
[63:53] how much do I need to retire? When can I
[63:56] stop working? People are exhausted, but
[63:58] they don't know how to plan for
[64:00] retirement. They legit because they
[64:02] they're not aware of Bitcoin. So they
[64:04] they don't know how to make the
[64:05] calculations. So I talked to a lot of
[64:07] people of my age that are just
[64:08] completely exhausted and frustrated and
[64:10] they don't know where the end is.
[64:13] Whereas the benefit of your generation
[64:16] and you growing up with Bitcoin,
[64:18] although that you're looking at property
[64:19] prices that are still monetized in
[64:21] value, so it's still high to buy
[64:22] property and you're like, "Oh, god damn,
[64:24] why isn't the property price cheaper
[64:25] already?" You know, so they're you're
[64:27] fighting maybe that battle, but the
[64:29] benefit that you have is your long-term
[64:33] mindset. You're going to have a bit more
[64:35] peace of mind than my generation because
[64:38] you can actually plan for your
[64:40] retirement properly. like you can think
[64:43] ahead and say, "Hey, if I have this much
[64:45] saved up in Bitcoin, I likely am not
[64:48] going to need to work anymore." Whereas
[64:51] my generation, people who don't
[64:52] understand Bitcoin, they don't have
[64:55] that. And so, it is nice for me to see
[64:58] that your generation is going to be able
[65:00] to have that. Hopefully, at least that's
[65:02] my hope. And it's a kind of a beautiful
[65:05] change because right now, I'm telling
[65:07] you, my generation in Canada, people are
[65:09] nervous. They don't know. How do you do
[65:11] the calculations for retirement when you
[65:13] don't know what the inflation rate's
[65:14] going to be? Is the inflation rate the 2
[65:16] to 3% the government tells you tells
[65:18] you? Is it the 8% of M2D? Is it 12? Is
[65:22] the cost of capital really 12 or 13%.
[65:25] How do you do your
[65:26] calculations to retire whereas I feel
[65:29] like you'll be able to do it. And not
[65:31] only will that give you peace of mind, I
[65:33] really feel like you'll be able to have
[65:34] a better positive impact on society
[65:36] because you're going to be able to do
[65:37] what you want to do in life. Whereas a
[65:39] lot of people my age have been forced
[65:41] into careers for 20, 30, 40 years and
[65:44] they don't want to do what they're
[65:45] doing, but it's the only thing they know
[65:48] to will earn them fiat dollars to try to
[65:50] make a life. So they're kind of going
[65:52] back to my Dave and Busters or
[65:54] Chuck-E-Cheese example. that are running
[65:55] around in this like circus environment
[65:57] trying to survive where you're going to
[65:59] be on the outside and you'll be able to
[66:01] make some decisions where you might want
[66:03] to spend 10 years of your life doing
[66:05] something that is really important to
[66:06] you and really serves the community and
[66:08] you'll be able to because you're saving
[66:10] in Bitcoin. So, it is like a big change
[66:12] that's already happening that maybe you
[66:14] don't see yet, but from my perspective
[66:16] and my age, I see that happening to you
[66:18] and that's quite nice. That's quite
[66:20] good. What what do you think Bitcoin
[66:23] will bring to us which isn't about
[66:26] financial things? There's something I I
[66:30] think it's going to bring peace of mind.
[66:32] Like I think it's going to return people
[66:34] to the family. Like I think it's going
[66:38] to allow people the freedom to be able
[66:42] to
[66:43] think long
[66:45] term and make better decisions for
[66:48] themselves and their families. Whereas
[66:51] right
[66:52] now people think so
[66:55] shortterm that everything is about
[66:58] survival like I have to do this to make
[67:00] some money because I need to pay for my
[67:02] rent or my house or you know
[67:05] everything's just so immediate and and
[67:08] it it just produces this kind of mindset
[67:11] of scarcity. So like I feel like
[67:13] Bitcoin's going to like bring love back,
[67:17] you know? I feel like everyone's been
[67:19] operating from a place of fear. And when
[67:21] I meet Bitcoiners like yourself, Robin,
[67:23] and other Bitcoiners, it's like
[67:24] everyone's pretty kind of cool.
[67:26] Everyone's kind of friendly. Everybody's
[67:28] kind of like, okay, maybe things aren't
[67:30] perfect, but there's hope. And I feel
[67:32] like it's going to bring that back in a
[67:35] compounding way like over the next 10
[67:38] years. Like if you look at we're 2025.
[67:42] in 2015. I don't know how many people
[67:44] were talking like this, but there's
[67:46] definitely more people talking like this
[67:48] in 2025 than there was in 2020 2015. If
[67:52] we extrapolate out another 10 years in
[67:54] 2035, how many more people will be
[67:57] talking like the way we're talking right
[67:58] now where Bitcoin could bring back hope
[68:00] and love and focus on the family? I
[68:02] think it's going to be a lot more. I
[68:04] think it's going to be a lot
[68:06] more. I think there might be chaos in
[68:08] between here and there, you know. I
[68:11] think it might be chaotic in a lot of
[68:13] ways, especially in the old system, but
[68:15] I think it's going to be a lot more. And
[68:16] I think that's going to be beautiful.
[68:19] Like everybody I I meet right now,
[68:20] there's some young families in my area.
[68:22] They're in their late 30s. They have
[68:23] many kids. They're just trying to
[68:25] survive with their business and pay
[68:27] their rent. They have no time to think
[68:29] and plan and focus on what's important
[68:31] for them. And I think Bitcoin's going to
[68:33] return that to them. And I think that's
[68:36] just beautiful. I don't know. I don't
[68:39] know. It's weird. It's weird times. I
[68:43] love that. It's weird. Beautiful answer.
[68:45] I love it. Yeah. I don't know if it's
[68:47] just
[68:49] Yeah. Yeah. I I hope it's right.
[68:54] Hope it's right.
[68:56] We will we'll make a second round uh or
[68:59] second round we will make definitely
[69:00] sooner, but like some some uh variation
[69:03] of that podcast in 10 years and and and
[69:05] look back at the first round of of this
[69:07] podcast and see how how it went. Yeah.
[69:10] Yeah. I guess I'm just hesitating
[69:11] because like I think I have Jeff Booth's
[69:13] like some of his comments ringing my
[69:14] ears like it's probably going to be
[69:16] chaotic between here and there. You
[69:18] know, it's going to be it's going to be
[69:19] great get the great but it's also going
[69:21] to be wild. You know, it it's it's a
[69:24] question that I have a lot in my mind of
[69:26] I'm I'm now so convinced that we go to
[69:28] this Bitcoin standard. It's a question
[69:31] of how fast and how rocky will the the
[69:34] way be. Same. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.
[69:38] But then I think there's just more of us
[69:40] like I'm just getting to know you now
[69:42] and we have some mutual friends and
[69:44] you've had Jeff. We talked about Jeff,
[69:46] you know, and I'm friends with Greg
[69:48] Foss. Um and like just it's like another
[69:51] group of us connected together all
[69:53] thinking very similarly but now
[69:56] globally and it's not just that we're
[69:58] all becoming friends. We're all
[70:00] controlling
[70:01] capital and we're all making decisions
[70:04] kind of with the same principles.
[70:07] And I think that compounds like I think
[70:09] it's very positive for humanity. Anyway,
[70:11] I'm going way I'm getting way off now.
[70:13] Yeah, I 100% uh agree with you here. Um
[70:17] we have a question in the podcast that
[70:19] asks each and every one of my guests and
[70:21] the question is what can we learn from
[70:23] you besides Bitcoin? The biggest thing
[70:26] uh yeah I we get as that that with from
[70:28] some of our clients is that um my
[70:30] brother and I were able to create
[70:32] personal freedom through the ability of
[70:35] building our own business from scratch.
[70:37] Zero dollars, zero clients, zero
[70:39] database of leads. And we were lucky
[70:42] enough to stumble into some mentors that
[70:44] taught us about like marketing and
[70:46] business building. And the marketing and
[70:49] business building strategies that we've
[70:51] learned over the years um to me offer me
[70:54] pure freedom because I feel I can end up
[70:56] in Croatia or Vienna next to you and and
[70:59] open a business and use the exact same
[71:01] principles
[71:03] um and start a successful business,
[71:05] exchange value and you know in return of
[71:08] that value accept some some Bitcoin and
[71:11] that gives me great peace of mind and
[71:14] freedom knowing that I can do that. So,
[71:17] our business building um skills um
[71:21] really have been valuable to us. So, I
[71:25] don't know if that's the answer you're
[71:26] looking for, Robin, but uh but yeah,
[71:28] we've spent a lot of time studying
[71:29] marketing and and what we discovered
[71:31] just kind of like money that a lot of
[71:32] people focus on tactics and strategies
[71:34] instead of
[71:35] principles. And when you enter business
[71:38] with principles and then layer in
[71:39] strategies and then use tactics, it's a
[71:41] lot simpler than, you know, using
[71:43] tactics and trying to build up to a
[71:45] principle business. So I think that's
[71:47] the biggest thing. I love that. And and
[71:50] knowledge and experience are the two
[71:53] things that are more valuable than than
[71:55] than Bitcoin. I mean yes, time and
[71:59] family and all all those things, but
[72:01] those come for me all all in experience
[72:04] and then there's knowledge and those are
[72:06] the two things that uh more more
[72:08] important and and more valuable than
[72:10] Bitcoin and after that there's there's
[72:12] not a lot. Yeah, agreed. Agreed. really
[72:16] cool. We have an end routine in the
[72:17] podcast where the previous guest is
[72:19] asking a question for the next guest
[72:21] without knowing who the next guest
[72:22] actually is and the previous guest asks
[72:24] you the question, do you think there is
[72:26] a science behind Bitcoin? Huh? Um, do I
[72:31] think there's a science behind Bitcoin?
[72:35] Question comes from a astrophysicist.
[72:38] Great, you gave me an easy one. Um I
[72:41] think there is
[72:44] some design behind uh Bitcoin. Yes. Um I
[72:48] don't know how they're designing uh
[72:50] defining science but I think there is
[72:54] some higher uh yeah there there is
[72:58] something behind uh Bitcoin than just
[73:00] like a random act. So yeah I don't know
[73:04] how to answer in the science. I'm no I'm
[73:06] I'm no astrophysicist or whatever you
[73:07] said. So, I apologize. You have to
[73:09] extend my apologies. I'm ruining the
[73:10] answer. But yeah, I would say yes.
[73:12] There's something um there's something
[73:15] scientific about uh about Bitcoin. Yes.
[73:19] Yeah. He's uh Steven from uh the Paulo.
[73:23] I I I don't want to even try to
[73:26] pronounce his last name because for me
[73:28] it just sounds like paranoid. Uh so the
[73:31] the paranoid, but it's definitely
[73:34] pronounced differently. Uh but yeah,
[73:36] he's he's big on the power law and and I
[73:38] think he was was was pointing to that.
[73:40] But uh yeah, uh it's also the question
[73:43] of how you define science because you're
[73:45] like, "Oh, Bitcoin could be computer
[73:47] science." So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
[73:51] Yeah. I have a question for your next
[73:53] guest. Is is is is Bitcoin a form of
[73:57] consciousness? Oh, I love that. I'm
[74:00] curious on that that that answer. Is is
[74:02] Bitcoin a form of consciousness? Um,
[74:05] poor next guest, who's going to answer
[74:06] that question? Um, it's uh that that's
[74:09] the fun of it because I tailor all the
[74:12] question for the guest or at least um
[74:16] directly or indirectly I tailor it for
[74:18] for the guest because I I would only ask
[74:21] you things that I think might be
[74:23] interesting to hear from you. But
[74:25] there's this one question at the end
[74:27] where the previous guest doesn't even
[74:29] know who the next guest is and and just
[74:32] throws things at him. Uh, and sometimes
[74:34] it's really suitable and sometimes not,
[74:36] but it's always fun for me.
[74:39] Cool.
[74:40] Yeah, really cool. Thank you so much,
