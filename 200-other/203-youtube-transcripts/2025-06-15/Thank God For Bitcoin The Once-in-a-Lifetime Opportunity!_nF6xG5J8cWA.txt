[00:00] I'm just so glad Bitcoin exists because
[00:02] the world could be a very messed up dark
[00:04] place without it since 1913 with the
[00:06] establishment of the the Federal Reserve
[00:08] and in the United States you know this
[00:09] has been something where governments and
[00:11] Central Bankers have wanted this ability
[00:12] to effectively make themselves Gods by
[00:14] being able to create money out of thin
[00:16] air the fiia system is is so corrupt
[00:18] it's heading one way it's insurmountable
[00:20] debt upon insurmountable debt the only
[00:22] way you can fix it is to opt into
[00:23] another system and start building within
[00:25] that new system which is Bitcoin which
[00:27] is an equity based system as opposed to
[00:28] a debt based system Bitcoin something
[00:30] that's rooted in honesty it's rooted in
[00:32] truth it's rooted in just publicly
[00:34] displaying every transaction that's ever
[00:36] existed you can't BS with it Bitcoin is
[00:39] a tool that I believe God has given us
[00:40] it restores my faith in humanity and it
[00:43] restores my faith in that God wants to
[00:45] give us good things and wants us to
[00:46] thrive and prosper and have humans
[00:48] flourish and uh I believe that can
[00:49] happen on a Bitcoin standard if value
[00:51] can be created by governments and
[00:53] Central Bankers out of thin air then
[00:55] functionally they are the gods of the
[00:57] system and if they are able to use that
[00:59] money that subsidize any idea then
[01:01] you're going to have signal
[01:03] [Music]
[01:07] confusion thank God for Bitcoin um maybe
[01:11] a first fun question why why do we have
[01:13] to thank God for
[01:15] Bitcoin that one yeah yeah so yeah this
[01:18] is I mean thank God for Bitcoin again we
[01:20] it's hilarious because when we first
[01:21] started looking for names for the book
[01:23] you know this is 2020 where you know
[01:25] CO's going on and so we're just on a
[01:27] zoom call going over names among other
[01:29] things with the book and I just remember
[01:32] I I was the only person in vocational
[01:33] Ministry at the time I was working as a
[01:35] as a pastor and living in Uruguay and uh
[01:37] and I just remember hearing thank God
[01:39] for Bitcoin and thinking well at least
[01:41] we know it won't be that whatever we
[01:43] name the book it won't be thank God for
[01:45] Bitcoin and then just the more that we
[01:47] thought about it the more I was like man
[01:48] it really is kind of catchy and and
[01:50] again yeah I think the the the spirit
[01:52] behind it is there's a book there's a a
[01:54] verse in the Book of James that says
[01:56] every good and perfect gift is from
[01:57] above you know shining down from the
[01:59] father of Lights uh it's talking about
[02:01] God and so like God is is the origin of
[02:04] all good gifts and so if Bitcoin is a
[02:07] good gift uh obviously we credit Satoshi
[02:09] with coming up with the ideas but you
[02:10] know to whom do we you know give credit
[02:12] for Satoshi having those ideas and
[02:14] having a body with which to process
[02:16] those ideas and in a body with which to
[02:17] put those ideas into into plan and so um
[02:21] so yeah so that's kind of why we we you
[02:22] know want to thank God for Bitcoin going
[02:24] to credit him with uh as being The Giver
[02:26] of all gifts including the ideas behind
[02:29] Bitcoin
[02:30] and it's funny how often it comes up
[02:32] because I'll just be I'll just be
[02:33] listening to podcasts or or I'll be in
[02:35] conversations with people about Bitcoin
[02:37] myself and you'll just kind of go down
[02:40] like this into this like really dark
[02:42] hole talking about the Fiat system and
[02:44] where we're going and it's just like
[02:46] things just get look really dark and
[02:47] then you just kind of breathe aside like
[02:49] oh thank God for Bitcoin like I'm just
[02:51] so glad Bitcoin exists because the world
[02:54] could be a very messed up dark place
[02:57] without it yeah in that in that sense we
[03:00] also have to thank God for fear then I
[03:03] guess no yeah this is a great
[03:06] conversation corruption money yeah yeah
[03:08] I mean again like how do you give credit
[03:10] because again this is the thing is like
[03:11] there's people who get cancer in the
[03:12] world there's people who die in the
[03:13] world and like so how do you how do you
[03:15] give God credit for certain things and
[03:16] not for others and and I think this is
[03:19] one of these things where you know God
[03:20] has he he's got a will he's got
[03:22] something that he desires the world to
[03:24] look like uh and then obviously people
[03:26] have their own wills and so the history
[03:28] of the world is this you know Cosmic
[03:30] Battle of you know again Jes somebody
[03:32] asked Jesus how do we pray or you know
[03:35] his disciples asked him to teach them to
[03:37] pray and Jesus a central component of
[03:39] the prayer was that you pray and ask God
[03:42] may your kingdom come and your will be
[03:44] done uh and so that's instead of
[03:46] necessarily our our will being done and
[03:49] and you know and our our will being done
[03:51] and our Our Kingdom coming and so
[03:53] there's one of these things this is a a
[03:54] constant Battle of you know who's whose
[03:56] will is ultimately going to be done in
[03:58] the world and so obviously since 1913
[04:00] with the establishment of the the
[04:01] Federal Reserve in the United States you
[04:03] know this has been something where you
[04:05] know governments and Central Bankers
[04:07] have wanted this idea wanted this
[04:09] ability to effectively make themselves
[04:11] Gods by creating by being able to create
[04:12] money out of thin air um and so again
[04:15] that there's a real sense in which Fiat
[04:16] money allows governments and central
[04:18] banks to to be Gods um you know they can
[04:22] they can fund and subsidize any ideas or
[04:24] programs or whatever that they that they
[04:26] want um and so you know again while
[04:30] while that might be true and you know
[04:31] while God allowed that to happen that's
[04:33] a different thing than saying this is
[04:35] what you know fiat currency and the type
[04:37] of things that it subsidizes is
[04:38] something that is aligned with the you
[04:40] know the revealed way that God wants the
[04:42] world to work interesting it's it's it's
[04:45] it's almost like um I by the way like
[04:48] religion is also interesting for me the
[04:50] word I recently learned uh religion uh
[04:53] is the coming together or something like
[04:55] that uh I forgot the exact meaning but
[04:57] like religion in itself just means like
[04:59] a Community coming together uh and when
[05:02] you press it down to that definition a
[05:05] lot of things can be a religion um and
[05:08] Bitcoin has a lot of those um um how
[05:13] should I say a lot of those religious
[05:15] aspects to it as like a mythical figure
[05:18] with satos Nakamoto there are those uh
[05:21] meetups uh we we meet certain points we
[05:25] come together uh I would not say we pray
[05:30] we pray to to the blockchain but uh when
[05:33] you come to events like the Haring and
[05:37] and how is it celebrated and those
[05:39] things there are some religious aspects
[05:41] uh in in Bitcoin even without the
[05:45] comparisons and even without the
[05:46] connections to actual religions it's
[05:48] really interesting to to to think about
[05:51] that that for me yeah yeah I mean I
[05:54] think and then you can add on to this
[05:55] too like I think like one of the things
[05:56] you see this question of like what what
[05:58] is religion in like what is religious
[06:01] and for a lot of us you know you we've
[06:02] been we haven't been trained with you
[06:04] know or raised with um you know
[06:06] formalized religious training and so we
[06:08] we're trained to think about or we're
[06:10] just kind of enculturated to think about
[06:12] religion as this weird thing that's over
[06:14] there that we've kind of mostly rejected
[06:16] as Society uh you know we we've kind of
[06:19] moved past it uh but again would you
[06:21] really get down to this asking this
[06:22] question of you know what is religion
[06:24] and like what is um you know what what
[06:27] kind of systems you know where what
[06:29] parts of life is Faith necessary and
[06:31] Faith required in you start to realize
[06:33] that I mean literally every aspect of
[06:35] our life is is grounded in faith in
[06:37] something um there's you know in the in
[06:39] the gap of places where we don't have
[06:41] personal firsthand knowledge we're we're
[06:43] depending on faith and so relationships
[06:46] are prefaced upon Faith um you know
[06:48] again as as a child you're completely
[06:50] dependent upon your parents to act in
[06:52] your best interest and sometimes that
[06:54] you know that doesn't work or you know
[06:55] in some cases again it's not your
[06:57] parents it's your grandparents or
[06:58] whatever uh but you know trust is this
[07:00] part of being human and so we can't we
[07:03] can't get away from that and so um
[07:05] obviously when you when you get down to
[07:07] looking at um you get down to looking at
[07:10] you know religions you know these things
[07:11] are prefaced upon at least in the case
[07:13] of Christianity and and many of these
[07:14] other things like there they're rooted
[07:16] in uh in history uh you know in the
[07:19] scriptures there's places that we we
[07:21] know existed and there's places where we
[07:22] can you know demonstrate oh this ruler
[07:24] that's talked about here also you know
[07:26] we can verify from normal history that
[07:27] this also existed and so um so I think
[07:30] that this is It's Something That We're
[07:31] Not accustomed to to thinking about uh
[07:33] in this sense um I also think that again
[07:35] you're right like Bitcoin has its own
[07:38] holidays and so the word holiday comes
[07:40] from the word holy from the two words
[07:42] holy days you know these are days that
[07:44] were set apart because they had
[07:46] important significance um and so yeah I
[07:49] I agree I think that you know basically
[07:52] I believe it was uh John Calvin who is
[07:54] it Calvin who talks about the the heart
[07:55] being an idol Factory um and so
[07:58] basically we we are we created to
[08:00] worship um this is something a way that
[08:02] God hardwired us and so it's not a
[08:04] question of whether or not we'll worship
[08:06] something it's it's which thing or which
[08:08] entity that we'll worship um and so
[08:10] again we see that there are people who
[08:12] worship Bitcoin and again I we
[08:15] understand it to a point uh but we want
[08:17] to especially in this book we talk about
[08:19] you know money in Money broadly in
[08:22] Bitcoin in particular is a great tool
[08:24] and so we want to wield The Tool uh
[08:27] toward the ends for which tools are
[08:29] created which is always in service of
[08:31] some some other Mission rather than
[08:33] seeing the tool as an ending of itself
[08:36] to Worship in into glory in in the
[08:40] tool interesting it's uh for me it's
[08:44] also interesting the what you talked
[08:47] about the freedom and the dependency on
[08:49] others uh because when you like Freedom
[08:52] doesn't mean you have no dependencies on
[08:55] on other people because then you're not
[08:57] free you basically have to live in the
[08:59] woods with no other beings and you have
[09:02] to kill your own animals and and do all
[09:04] those stuff if you really want to be
[09:06] completely free and I think that's not
[09:09] Freedom like if you want to have maximum
[09:12] Freedom you have to find the balance of
[09:13] being dependent in the right areas in
[09:15] your life and being independent in the
[09:17] in in the in in the right areas in your
[09:19] life it's a really interesting
[09:21] discussion of of of what what freedom is
[09:25] really like and what faith and and Trust
[09:27] in in others uh is is looking like
[09:29] because even with my podcast now I I get
[09:32] my I'm currently in the works of
[09:33] onboarding my first employee I have to
[09:36] have the faith and the trust that uh
[09:38] that we can work together and that we we
[09:40] we build on similar Vision with for the
[09:43] podcast so that's that's super
[09:45] interesting also for you because you
[09:46] were both uh writing on the book uh
[09:48] working together can be complicated can
[09:51] be challenging but I think also really
[09:53] really rewarding how how was it to to
[09:55] write the book to
[09:57] together it was good yeah it was good we
[10:00] we definitely had to make some
[10:01] adjustments along the way I I'll tell
[10:02] the story so um this is the book here uh
[10:05] The Gospel According to bitcoin and um
[10:07] it's 21 meditations we we on the outset
[10:10] we knew that we had we we had to get 21
[10:13] different chapters in there just because
[10:14] you know it's bitcoin's magic number and
[10:17] we had a whole bunch in mind and so
[10:19] Jordan had a bunch in mind I had a bunch
[10:21] in mind and so we just started writing
[10:23] and oh when was it Jordan it was I think
[10:26] earlier this year uh maybe in March or
[10:28] something when we were trying to get
[10:30] this ready to launch by Bitcoin 24 um or
[10:34] sorry last year um by Bitcoin 24 in uh
[10:37] in Nashville uh at the at the tgb uh
[10:40] tgfb conference and our editor comes
[10:42] back to us and says guys you can't
[10:45] publish the book yet you you're writing
[10:46] two different books and so we realized
[10:49] that like all the chapters I was writing
[10:51] were really kind of designed as more of
[10:52] like a meditation format like almost
[10:55] like devotional style of somewhere like
[10:57] someone uh like easy access to to
[11:00] someone who maybe doesn't isn't a
[11:01] Christian who could get into and see
[11:04] like a principle of of of Bitcoin uh how
[11:07] that and how that's reflected in
[11:08] Christianity and kind of learned
[11:09] something from that whereas Jordan was
[11:11] was doing kind of more a deep dive
[11:12] philosophically into the nature of of
[11:15] money itself and and how that connects
[11:17] with with Christianity and so it ended
[11:18] up being just two two different styles
[11:21] and so we ended up having to to separate
[11:24] those out and so this book tends more to
[11:27] it has more of the chapters that I wrote
[11:30] um and I'm hoping that at some point
[11:31] Jordan will will also have another book
[11:34] that maybe I can contribute to as well
[11:36] uh that will be more kind of the
[11:38] philosophy uh of money and Theology of
[11:41] money as well so so that asked the the
[11:45] 21 meditation to Gospel According the
[11:47] Bitcoin there's thank God for Bitcoin
[11:50] how many books just to get what we
[11:52] talking about two different books two
[11:54] different books yeah we publish thank
[11:56] God for Bitcoin this is a different
[11:57] group of people me and seven other
[11:58] people thank God for Bitcoin in 2021
[12:01] beginning of 2021 and then this uh The
[12:04] Gospel According to bitcoin is kind of
[12:06] our second second book that tgfb has
[12:07] published yeah you can go find it on
[12:09] Amazon or um we actually do need we need
[12:11] Amazon purchases and in Amazon reviews
[12:13] we've got we've gotten a bunch of orders
[12:14] from our website which is usually it's
[12:16] the opposite but uh but yeah so if
[12:18] you're if you want to support uh support
[12:20] it go get it there but yeah I think this
[12:21] is It's one of these things where again
[12:23] the the kind of the summary of of why
[12:25] the two different books uh thank God for
[12:28] Bitcoin is designed to help a broadly
[12:30] Christian audience kind of you know
[12:32] grock Bitcoin um you know why does this
[12:35] matter you know why do we why do we
[12:36] think you should that Christians should
[12:38] care about these things again not
[12:39] necessarily in unique ways like you know
[12:41] this is it's not saying oh this other
[12:43] people it it matters more to Christians
[12:45] about Bitcoin that's not what we're
[12:46] saying at all it's just we're tailoring
[12:48] the message of trying to help a specific
[12:51] audience understand Bitcoin and so in
[12:53] the same way that when you go fishing
[12:54] you use particular bait to catch
[12:56] particular fish we kind of want to do
[12:58] the same thing with the arguments the
[12:59] specific arguments that we choose that
[13:01] we chose to to you know help people help
[13:03] Christians uh make sense of Bitcoin so
[13:06] then with the Gospel According to
[13:07] bitcoin it was more created to okay so
[13:10] again kind of do the opposite which is
[13:12] all right we have a lot of people who
[13:15] crazy things start happening when you
[13:16] start getting into Bitcoin and you start
[13:18] you know getting into a a rooted
[13:20] understanding of of you know the role of
[13:22] energy in the world and the role of
[13:24] energy in in the formation of money um
[13:27] you start to look at the world and start
[13:29] to look at a lot of things differently
[13:30] than you did before uh and so one of
[13:33] these things is is religion you start
[13:34] looking at religion differently and so
[13:36] we have seen I mean numerous people who
[13:39] were the farthest thing from religious
[13:41] people and then they get into Bitcoin
[13:43] and within a few years they either
[13:44] become Christians outright or they they
[13:46] at least are on the road and considering
[13:48] things that they never you know would
[13:49] have would have thought about you know
[13:51] in another they never would have
[13:52] imagined themselves thinking about and
[13:53] so I think part of it is you have these
[13:55] people who you know they're like they
[13:57] they come through they go down the
[13:58] Bitcoin rabbit ho and they they realized
[14:01] man I was ignorant to like to something
[14:03] that is so Central to how the world
[14:06] works that and you know if I was so
[14:08] wrong and and unaware of what was you
[14:10] know what's actually going on in that
[14:12] realm what are some other Realms within
[14:14] my life and within the world that maybe
[14:16] I'm just I've totally you know dismissed
[14:18] or thought were ridiculous that maybe
[14:20] I'm willing to kind of you know lend
[14:22] them a second second opportunity I'm
[14:24] willing to kind of hear him out and so I
[14:26] think that's that's part of of what's
[14:27] going on and so we wrote thank for or we
[14:29] wrote The Gospel According to bitcoin um
[14:32] for maybe people who are you're you're
[14:33] sold on bitcoin but maybe you've got
[14:35] questions you're like why are there so
[14:37] many like and I don't know what this
[14:38] looks like in in your context but why
[14:40] are there so many people who are
[14:42] becoming Christian in and who are who
[14:44] are Christians who are into Bitcoin like
[14:46] wait this is kind of a phenomenon that a
[14:47] lot of people have recognized For Better
[14:49] or For Worse and so we we kind of want
[14:51] to you know give from our perspective
[14:54] why it is that as Christians you know we
[14:56] see a lot of overlap uh between kind of
[14:59] the message of the gospel and and the
[15:00] way that Bitcoin Works in in some you
[15:03] really odd ways it's definitely like
[15:05] that I I see that I saw it with myself
[15:08] um before Bitcoin I stepped out of the
[15:11] church mainly because you have to pay I
[15:14] was oh uh yeah in Austria there is uh
[15:18] basically if you want to be uh in the
[15:21] the church you also have to pay
[15:23] according to what you can pay and it's
[15:26] it's based on your salary and I was like
[15:28] and and not attacks like why should I
[15:30] why should I do that so it's like a
[15:32] formal agreement like you have to sign
[15:33] like a formal agreement uh yes it's it's
[15:36] not as integrated as in Germany in
[15:39] Germany um it's a form of the salary as
[15:43] a tax uh and they directly get it away
[15:46] you never see it on your bank account
[15:48] and and and they directly put it to to
[15:50] the church in Austria it's more of a
[15:53] separate thing where you uh they contact
[15:56] you and you can ask them to reduce it if
[15:59] you explain the situation of like oh
[16:01] like I got a second baby and I cannot
[16:04] afford to pay something like that or you
[16:07] student then you can get examed like if
[16:08] you're student still till like 25 you
[16:11] get an exam but at some point you have
[16:13] to pay um uh and then uh you the only
[16:17] choice if you don't want to pay is to
[16:19] officially step out of the
[16:21] church and uh me starting uh uh my
[16:26] official career and I was like I already
[16:29] pay taxes a lot in Austria like that's
[16:31] the tax I can get rid of I didn't at all
[16:34] think about the religious aspect and
[16:36] just stepped out of it that's why I'm
[16:38] officially non-religious um like I'm
[16:42] that that's what I am um and honestly
[16:45] with Bitcoin I'm currently in the in the
[16:48] process of like rethinking that it's a
[16:50] long process it's not something that I'm
[16:51] really passionate about and Diving
[16:53] deepen but the more and more I learn
[16:55] especially I have 400 Bitcoin is on
[16:57] there are a lot of Christians in in
[16:59] there wow and you get influenced by that
[17:01] so uh I'm not a fan of uh the the church
[17:06] taking a percentage cut of the salary
[17:10] yeah that's a weird thing is that
[17:12] different in America yeah it's very
[17:14] different in North I'll say North
[17:15] America so I live in Canada and uh I I
[17:19] don't know about you Jordan but we're
[17:20] we're pretty strong separation of church
[17:22] and state over here and so it's actually
[17:25] like at the church that I attend it's
[17:27] actually it's you go on our website and
[17:30] it's actually in one of the doctrines
[17:31] like we believe in the separation of
[17:33] church and state and so yeah I remember
[17:35] traveling in Denmark one time and just
[17:38] it boggled my mind that people actually
[17:41] voted to keep donating to the churches
[17:45] like to keep having the church being
[17:46] funded by their taxes just that the
[17:49] whole the whole concept of that just is
[17:51] I find mindboggling because we have such
[17:53] a distinct separation over here yeah so
[17:56] you can just so I to ask so you can just
[17:59] uh donate uh if you want to there's no
[18:03] like oh if you earn that and you're in
[18:05] the in in the church you have to give at
[18:07] least like 1% of your salary or
[18:08] something like that that's right yeah
[18:10] you just it's it's all free will giving
[18:12] you just you give what you want to give
[18:14] that's how it's supposed to be like I
[18:16] like that more yeah I think so yeah yeah
[18:19] again and this it's funny we're talking
[18:21] about this because like this is
[18:21] something I actually have thought about
[18:23] more in the last few years because again
[18:25] America I mean you know americ we're
[18:27] we're not exact known for you just
[18:30] having people just tell us what to do
[18:32] like you know for better and for worse
[18:33] and so yeah so that's definitely you
[18:35] know at at a government level probably
[18:37] wouldn't fly um but again I think like
[18:39] again I could see wisdom in it again
[18:41] provided you do a good job of
[18:43] communicating the wise and this is a
[18:46] this is part of a you know the why of
[18:47] the situation and this is part of the
[18:49] thing that I think is is very difficult
[18:51] to do um like you see in in the I mean
[18:54] in the book of Deuteronomy it talks
[18:56] about you know you have Moses and he's
[18:57] talking to the people and he's them
[18:59] about the need for them to you know to
[19:01] you know teach their kids and like
[19:02] explain to their kids they said he says
[19:04] to them when you're when you're walking
[19:05] in the way or when you're sitting you're
[19:07] sitting in your house and your kids
[19:09] start asking you questions about why do
[19:10] we do these things um and he just
[19:12] basically talks about you know you need
[19:13] to be able to tell them why like tell
[19:16] them why these things and and show them
[19:17] like the consequences of you know of not
[19:19] doing them and the points that we
[19:20] haven't done things and so I think that
[19:22] that's a big part of the thing that a
[19:23] lot of us around the world and a lot of
[19:25] people around the world are going
[19:26] through is we have these traditions
[19:29] and we have these you know things that
[19:30] are even built into our law systems that
[19:33] are they were done for a purpose but
[19:36] they're not like the tradition is not
[19:38] being explained and so then it there's a
[19:40] there's a famous example of chesterton's
[19:41] fence have you guys ever heard heard of
[19:43] this uh never heard about it okay so GK
[19:45] Chesterton was a was a British um author
[19:48] and and you know just really interesting
[19:50] guy wrote a ton of books uh his his most
[19:52] famous book is called um the Everlasting
[19:55] man or Orthodoxy is probably his most
[19:57] his most famous one but talks about um
[20:00] there's a famous principle called
[20:01] chesterton's fence which is if you find
[20:03] a fence uh you shouldn't just remove it
[20:06] because you don't understand why it's
[20:07] there you should figure out why it was
[20:08] put there and and then you can determine
[20:11] you know whether or not it's something
[20:12] that ought to be removed uh but it's the
[20:14] idea of you can imagine like Jurassic
[20:15] Park you know you're in Jurassic Park
[20:17] you see this giant fence and you're like
[20:19] well you know let's just get rid of this
[20:21] you know and then you remove it and then
[20:22] TX comes along and eats you you know
[20:24] it's one of these they're one of these
[20:25] ideas where you you you want to be slow
[20:27] to just get of things that you don't
[20:29] understand um and so but yeah I still do
[20:32] think for a lot of people um yeah and
[20:35] especially in America like it that that
[20:37] would be crazy uh it would be crazy for
[20:40] them to for people from their
[20:42] perspective to think about the
[20:43] government you know forcing them to to
[20:45] give even if you could opt out of it
[20:47] even if there were Provisions yeah
[20:49] that's
[20:50] him interesting yeah like that that's uh
[20:54] that like it struck me so badly and I
[20:56] think it's if it's forced um it turns
[20:59] off people uh they don't as as with me I
[21:03] I don't even look like oh why
[21:05] Christianity why religious like I didn't
[21:07] even ask those questions because it was
[21:10] so turned off by the idea that I have to
[21:13] pay for that and I was like but why do I
[21:17] have to pay for that like I don't want
[21:18] to do that like that turns you off so
[21:20] quickly that you don't even uh come to
[21:23] the question of like oh like maybe I
[21:25] should do a deeper research like uh if
[21:28] if you force things on it's if you force
[21:31] a small kid into something uh it's very
[21:34] likely that uh it wants to exact
[21:36] opposite yeah
[21:39] y but yeah that's uh that's interesting
[21:41] um just to clarify because we thank God
[21:44] for Bitcoin you you're doing conferences
[21:46] you're doing publishing you have the
[21:48] book uh so you're like kind of an
[21:50] organization uh and you have to book for
[21:52] that you have to confers into meetups
[21:54] and that's kind of what you're doing
[21:56] yeah so we again the meetups is kind of
[21:57] a newer thing actually uh shout out to
[21:59] Samuel Samuel keman is kind of he's kind
[22:01] of leading the charge and planning on
[22:03] starting a at least he was talking about
[22:05] doing it starting a tgfb Meetup uh in in
[22:08] Austria I think or Switzerland I'm sorry
[22:11] um but yeah so basically long story
[22:12] short we ended up writing the book in
[22:14] 2021 and then about a year passed and we
[22:18] had I mean we had way better reception
[22:19] to the book than we ever could have
[22:20] imagined um I think we've sold around
[22:23] around like 30,000 copies of the book
[22:24] which is I thought you said 50,000 yeah
[22:26] and I think I we just we going over the
[22:28] the other day and I I think I I don't
[22:29] know where I got that wrong but I think
[22:31] it's I think it's closer to 30 um but so
[22:34] we were we were going over that and uh
[22:36] or the book came out it was really
[22:37] widely received and then uh and then
[22:40] about a year I guess a year yeah a
[22:42] little a little more than a year went by
[22:44] and Jimmy song uh just basically said
[22:47] hey we should do like a a tgfb
[22:48] conference or something like a one- day
[22:50] event maybe in Miami you know in 2022
[22:52] the day before the big Bitcoin
[22:54] conference and so long story short I got
[22:56] asked to to uh you know to organ oriz it
[22:58] and so me and another guy organized it
[23:00] and uh in the aftermath of the
[23:02] conference we had we had politicians
[23:03] show up we had you know a bunch of
[23:05] different people about 175 people showed
[23:07] up with about six weeks notice um and
[23:09] then the aftermath some of the other
[23:11] guys who had written the book who were
[23:12] all either you know OG bitcoiners buying
[23:14] Bitcoin at $5 a coin or you know
[23:17] entrepreneurs who' founded and exited
[23:19] multiple businesses they basically said
[23:21] hey Jordan if you want to do this
[23:23] full-time if you want to work to you
[23:25] know basically create a media company to
[23:27] help you know start do podcast and
[23:29] publish other books and and then just go
[23:31] to events you know run your own events
[23:33] and then also go to other conferences to
[23:34] kind of help the the broader Christian
[23:36] World understand what Bitcoin is and why
[23:38] it matters and the effects it has on
[23:40] them uh you know we're willing to fund
[23:42] you and so they gave me a couple years
[23:44] of funding or a few years of funding um
[23:46] and so yeah so that's kind of what we
[23:48] what we do U we do a bunch of stuff like
[23:49] that and so again part of it is
[23:50] publishing as well so that's where
[23:52] that's where the you know publishing
[23:53] this book comes in that's amazing the
[23:56] the giving mood uh generosity of of
[23:58] Bitcoin I I love that it's also
[24:00] something that kind of connects the
[24:02] Bitcoin Community with with the
[24:04] Christianity Community I love that yep
[24:06] yeah definitely really interesting will
[24:09] you also do one in Las Vegas uh coming
[24:12] up so yeah so the so the thing about
[24:14] Vegas is this is funny I mean like it it
[24:16] makes sense in a lot of ways you're like
[24:18] so we we were talking we probably got I
[24:20] would say three or 400 like core people
[24:22] who you know they're they're pretty
[24:24] actively involved you know with us on a
[24:26] regular basis and that and it's growing
[24:28] um
[24:28] but so as we were talking about like
[24:30] doing a conference in Vegas there were
[24:32] like about half of them who are just
[24:33] like I don't really want to go to Vegas
[24:35] you know like there it's kind of it's
[24:37] the name of Vegas like the there's a a
[24:39] nickname for it in the United States and
[24:40] it's Sin City so like the idea of a
[24:43] Christian Conference in Sin City didn't
[24:45] didn't sit well with some people so um
[24:47] now again with from from my standpoint
[24:49] I'm like yeah I I get that like that you
[24:51] know there's people who have histories
[24:53] they have vices you know like I mean if
[24:55] you have somebody who's an alcoholic
[24:56] then sending them setting them loose on
[24:57] Vegas you know maybe it wouldn't be the
[24:59] smartest thing um so anyhow what we
[25:01] decided to do was we we're not going to
[25:02] do our main we usually do like a two-day
[25:05] event um so we're not going to do our
[25:06] main two-day event in in Las Vegas we're
[25:09] going to do a a one like an afternoon
[25:12] evening like VIP dinner um so the goal
[25:15] is basically get 15 Bitcoin celebrities
[25:19] get them there and have about 75 people
[25:22] total so the goal is to have one Bitcoin
[25:23] celebrity at like a table with four or
[25:26] five other people um and so then yeah
[25:28] just get to be able to be there and hang
[25:29] out with people that you know and and
[25:31] have a really good meal I'm talking to a
[25:32] buddy of mine who does really good
[25:35] barbecue really good like Southern style
[25:37] barbecue uh you know cook meat and stuff
[25:39] and so I'm gonna we're gonna fly him out
[25:41] and he's going to cook for all of us um
[25:43] so yeah that's kind of what we're doing
[25:44] what we're doing this year but yeah we
[25:46] in the past we have done our own
[25:47] Standalone conferences and you mentioned
[25:49] Jordan that there's maybe something else
[25:51] in the fall as well right yeah so the
[25:53] goal the the plan right now is to do the
[25:55] either the end of September or early
[25:56] October do a a two event in Nashville um
[26:00] and so that will that will be much more
[26:01] of a the the the VIP dinner is much more
[26:05] like an Insider like you're already a
[26:07] bitcoiner or you're you know you want to
[26:08] meet your your Bitcoin podcast people
[26:11] who you've been listening to or whatever
[26:12] and then the other event is much more
[26:14] like hey I'm into Bitcoin I want to
[26:16] invite my you know people from my church
[26:18] or my family I want them to come in and
[26:19] kind of hear like an A to Z you know
[26:22] explanation over the course of two days
[26:24] about you know some of the reasons that
[26:26] bit some of the ways Bitcoin is being
[26:27] used and some of the reasons why uh you
[26:29] know why we get so excited about it
[26:32] really cool um I want to get uh into one
[26:35] thing I mean that's kind of the first
[26:37] thing I want wanted to get into but uh
[26:39] the conversation already developed um
[26:42] what are the uh biblical foundations
[26:45] that align with Bitcoin the most like
[26:48] what what are the the core uh values the
[26:50] core things that that that you can
[26:52] compare Bitcoin and and Christianity
[26:55] they with well there there's at least 21
[26:58] of them
[27:01] um and you can read about it in the book
[27:03] um there yeah there's probably a lot of
[27:05] different ways we could we could tackle
[27:06] this um the one that I love to to maybe
[27:10] Center on is like uh you I don't know if
[27:12] you you're probably familiar with Jeff
[27:13] Boo and many of um your audience would
[27:15] be familiar with Jeff boo he has a
[27:17] saying that he's popularized the idea
[27:20] that you you can't fix the system from
[27:22] within the system and this idea that you
[27:25] know Fiat uh the Fiat system is is is so
[27:28] corrupt it's heading one way it just
[27:30] it's it's uh insurmountable debt upon
[27:32] insurmountable debt and the only way you
[27:35] can fix it is that opt into another
[27:37] system and start building within that
[27:38] new system which is Bitcoin which is an
[27:40] equity based system as opposed to a debt
[27:42] based system and so one of the one of
[27:45] the chapters in this book or meditations
[27:46] in this book we we capitalize on this
[27:48] and and showcase how in the same way we
[27:51] can't fix ourselves in the same way us
[27:54] as as uh as bitcoiners we're always
[27:56] trying to do the next big we're you know
[27:58] we're trying to take cold baths cut out
[28:00] seed oils we're trying to eat only meats
[28:02] you know we've got all these like
[28:03] self-improvement tools where we're
[28:05] trying to make ourselves better people
[28:07] and more healthy people and all these
[28:09] things um and and at the same time uh I
[28:13] think where this intersects with
[28:14] Christianity Christianity says no one
[28:17] can fix themselves every other religion
[28:19] is basically saying you need to be meet
[28:22] this bar to be good enough morally to
[28:24] reach God you need to do more good
[28:25] things you need to go to church more you
[28:27] need to go to MOS more read more books
[28:29] pray more whatever it is do more giving
[28:32] and then you'll be good enough to reach
[28:33] God but Christianity says you're just no
[28:37] one's good enough to reach God and so
[28:39] the only solution is for God actually to
[28:40] intervene and to step down out of heaven
[28:43] and to come and save us and so in the
[28:45] same way as we as bitcoiners understand
[28:47] we can't fix the Fiat system from within
[28:49] the system we need an external system to
[28:51] come fix us in the same way it's with
[28:53] it's with our own lives too we we can't
[28:55] fix ourselves we need uh we need God
[28:58] actually step out of Heaven to come and
[28:59] save us and so that would be maybe one
[29:02] where that I would start with but
[29:03] there's there's a lot more than that
[29:06] it's super interesting I love that
[29:09] Jordan uh you wanted do in yeah yeah the
[29:12] I mean the the one that I always because
[29:14] again I'm like I my brain just works
[29:16] this way is like all right what's the
[29:17] lowest common denominator like how do we
[29:20] and so one of the things when I again I
[29:22] was a pastor for a couple years and then
[29:24] was a was a missionary and you know
[29:26] helping work with the small Church yor
[29:28] way for a number of years even before
[29:29] that and so one of the things as I was
[29:32] doing sermon prep uh you know like every
[29:34] week you have to prepare you know like a
[29:35] half hour sermon for for people you you
[29:38] know you read a Bible passage and kind
[29:39] of explain what it means and then how it
[29:41] applies to you know people's lives and
[29:43] so um I was reading in the book of
[29:44] Galatians and near the end the Apostle
[29:47] Paul he says that God is Not mocked for
[29:50] what a man SWS that will he also reap
[29:53] and so he he just basically so I'm
[29:55] sitting there we've got a lot of new
[29:56] Christians uh or people who aren't yet
[29:58] Christians who are in our church and so
[30:00] I'm like trying to I'm like all right
[30:01] how do I explain this in the in the
[30:03] simplest way possible how do I rephrase
[30:05] this and so the the you know rephrasing
[30:08] that came to my mind was okay so God has
[30:10] so hardwired this principle of sewing
[30:12] and reaping into the fabric of the
[30:14] universe that to deny that is to mock
[30:17] God and so I started trying to think of
[30:19] like what are some examples of of this
[30:21] sewing and reaping uh and so you know
[30:23] the Apostle Paul he talks about that um
[30:25] he says um he talks about uh working so
[30:28] there was this there were this group of
[30:29] people that they became Christians and
[30:31] and part of the you know Christian
[30:32] doctrine is that Jesus is going to you
[30:34] know Jesus has risen from the dead um
[30:37] he's ascended into heaven and is there
[30:38] right now and there comes a point in the
[30:40] future where he's going to return and so
[30:42] part of the the way that some of these
[30:44] people interpreted this these these new
[30:46] Christians they said well listen if
[30:47] Jesus is coming back then then what are
[30:50] we working for like we should just be
[30:52] you know chilling we should be chilling
[30:53] and you know like telling people like
[30:55] about Jesus and then he'll come back and
[30:56] then you know they exp in him any day
[30:59] and so so one of the things that the
[31:01] Apostle Paul says to these people who
[31:03] think this way he's like no no no guys
[31:05] like you're you're using you're using
[31:07] you know you're trying the way that
[31:08] you're applying what you think this is a
[31:10] saying is wrong and so he basically
[31:12] tells these guys if someone isn't
[31:13] willing to work then neither should they
[31:16] eat and so so I was like thinking about
[31:18] this I'm like okay so what what is the
[31:20] logic there and the logic is that like
[31:22] food gives you energy to be able to work
[31:25] and what's the point of working it's to
[31:27] be able to serve those around you and so
[31:29] if the Apostle Paul is saying if you're
[31:31] not willing to to work then neither
[31:32] should you eat so if you're not willing
[31:34] to uh take the energy that's afforded to
[31:36] you by food and Steward it into work
[31:40] that serves everybody else then you
[31:41] shouldn't eat you're missing the point
[31:43] of why you're eating and and why you're
[31:45] getting that energy and so if you follow
[31:47] this for a long enough time Horizon if
[31:48] somebody isn't willing to work well then
[31:49] you know they're not going to eat and
[31:51] then they're going to die effectively is
[31:53] kind of like the extreme outworking of
[31:54] this so again there's an example of of
[31:56] sewing and reaping
[31:58] and we could go down a bunch of
[31:59] different examples but kind of the the
[32:01] culminating one is in Jesus So within
[32:04] different Faith Traditions um you have
[32:06] they just basically see and and see God
[32:09] dealing with uh the this the problem of
[32:12] sin and the problem of you know
[32:13] corruption in the world they see him
[32:15] handling it a few different ways and so
[32:17] for example in within
[32:18] Islam within Islam like sin is not
[32:21] something that needs to be paid for um
[32:23] Allah in in their case can just forgive
[32:25] sins he can just kind of papy you know
[32:27] like declare you you know your sins are
[32:29] forgiven and So within the Christian
[32:32] conception you know to borrow a Bitcoin
[32:33] phrase like we we see that kind of
[32:35] arrangement as as more of like a Fiat
[32:37] you know Arrangement like you know there
[32:39] has been if there's been sin that's been
[32:41] committed there has to be a
[32:43] corresponding payment for for that sin
[32:46] and so this is how it works within the
[32:47] Christian system is that you know God
[32:49] doesn't just handwave away our sins he
[32:52] doesn't say that they're actually not a
[32:53] big deal I'll forgive you you know just
[32:55] don't do it again he he doesn't do that
[32:57] he actually sends his son to to be the
[33:00] the sacrifice for our sins and so Jesus
[33:02] dies in our place um and so this is this
[33:05] is a this is a proof of work system you
[33:07] know it's a it's a closed system that
[33:09] has inputs and and outputs um and so
[33:13] this is something that you know as as I
[33:14] started to look at at the you know the
[33:16] monetary systems of the world uh the
[33:18] thing that hit me is that every single
[33:21] currency in the world fundamentally
[33:23] denies like all these Fiat currencies
[33:25] they they deny this principle of sewing
[33:27] and reaping because there's no real work
[33:29] going into the creation of of these
[33:31] different currencies around the world
[33:33] you know in the past if you had a a gold
[33:35] or you know some other commodity based
[33:36] system you have to do work on the front
[33:39] end in order to produce money like you
[33:41] can't just get gold out of thin air like
[33:43] you have to go and pay people to dig it
[33:45] up you have to pay for tools to do that
[33:47] with you have to pay for stuff to refine
[33:49] the gold um and so you know that's
[33:52] contrasted with fiat currency which
[33:53] allows governments to take the same
[33:54] piece of paper and put a 100 on it or a
[33:57] one on it or a five on it and and
[33:59] multiply their purchasing power far
[34:02] beyond you know what would be possible
[34:03] otherwise and so so this this idea of
[34:06] sewing and reaping is something that we
[34:07] see all throughout you know the world
[34:10] and in human existence and and pro I
[34:11] mean literally thousands of different
[34:13] places um you know you could plant seeds
[34:15] you plant a tomato seed you're going to
[34:17] get tomatoes you're not going to get
[34:18] you're not going to get an apple tree
[34:20] from from a tomato seed um and so we
[34:22] just seeing this principle everywhere uh
[34:25] you know that kind of just came to mind
[34:26] as I was thinking about money money and
[34:28] and again I think this is just a really
[34:29] underappreciated thing that we just
[34:31] don't haven't thought about a lot and
[34:33] haven't talked about a lot I partnered
[34:35] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[34:39] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[34:41] saw created by anyone look at that
[34:44] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante

[35:35] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[35:38] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[35:41] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[35:44] personal recommendation for Hardware

[36:46] of going back to this proof of work
[36:48] concept which I I totally love I see
[36:51] sometimes bitcoiners um that use low
[36:54] time preference as an excuse to be
[36:58] [Laughter]
[37:00] yeah and that that's again that's what
[37:01] the Apostle Paul was talking about in
[37:03] the you know writing to the the church
[37:05] in thessalonica is yeah like you
[37:07] shouldn't be using you know the the fact
[37:10] that you you know you have this benefit
[37:11] you know the fact that you've believed
[37:13] in Jesus you know and and you know he
[37:15] saved you from your sins you know this
[37:17] isn't something that you just say okay
[37:18] well then now I can just do whatever I
[37:20] want to you know like that that's not
[37:22] the that's not the reason why you know
[37:24] we've received this gift and so I think
[37:26] the same could be said about Bitcoin
[37:27] like you know it's it would be it'd be
[37:29] easy to sit back and go well I've got
[37:31] Bitcoin I don't need to tell anybody
[37:33] else about it you know it's going to be
[37:34] hard people are not going to get it it's
[37:35] going to be annoying you know you could
[37:37] use you could use finding this good gift
[37:39] of Bitcoin this good tool of Bitcoin as
[37:41] an excuse just to ignore everyone else
[37:43] and and obviously there's a middle
[37:44] ground between you know going around and
[37:46] fanatically telling everybody at all
[37:48] times about it and you know annoying
[37:50] people um but again I I think that
[37:52] you're you're absolutely
[37:53] right it's it's it's kind of this uh you
[37:56] you found Bitcoin and you want to tell
[38:00] everyone I mean if I I have this I think
[38:04] there's like some sort of um correlation
[38:07] to time I think in the beginning you're
[38:09] skeptical then you get into Bitcoin and
[38:11] once you really get it you you get in
[38:13] the face where you want to tell people
[38:15] because it like it broke your mind and
[38:16] you really want to get it out there and
[38:19] but then you realize oh okay
[38:22] it's my my environment doesn't react the
[38:25] way that I thought it it would rag like
[38:28] not everyone is all of the sudden uh
[38:30] jumping and saying like oh let's let's
[38:32] do this Bitcoin thing and then you say
[38:35] like oh like Bitcoin is in available and
[38:37] you just kind of just like orange peing
[38:39] and educating people that are ready for
[38:40] it and then it goes down a little bit uh
[38:43] and and probably similar also with with
[38:46] Christianity is is there an aspect of
[38:48] Bitcoin that doesn't align with with
[38:51] Christianity let you take that Dan
[38:53] that's a good question I I haven't
[38:54] really thought of the inverse to be
[38:56] honest um um I I mean they're two
[39:00] different things right we're comparing
[39:01] apples and oranges in a way um but uh I
[39:05] mean the the Arc of Christianity is is
[39:08] is that you have the creation of the
[39:10] world you have the fall of the world the
[39:13] story of Adam and Eve is famous uh we
[39:15] have the Redemption of the world through
[39:16] Christ and then we have the Restoration
[39:18] in the end and I think when people find
[39:21] Bitcoin they see like wow there's
[39:23] actually like a and this is I think the
[39:26] name of the think or the subtitle of
[39:28] thank God for Bitcoin is it's like the
[39:29] the restoration of money or something
[39:31] like that like but this is like a a new
[39:34] almost almost perfect form of money or a
[39:36] great form of money best we've ever seen
[39:38] before and so you see this Redemption
[39:40] aspect happening in money and you start
[39:42] to extrapolate that and start think like
[39:44] where else where else can this happen
[39:46] like can this happen in other areas of
[39:47] society can this happen in in our
[39:49] education can this happen in our
[39:50] governments can this happen in my own
[39:52] personal life in my family and all kinds
[39:53] of things like that and so yeah oh yeah
[39:56] the creation corruption Redemption
[39:58] retion of money yeah so that's the uh
[40:00] subtitle yeah Dan Dan and we we kind of
[40:03] we Ed that that rough framework that Dan
[40:04] just said creation corruption Redemption
[40:07] and then restoration that's kind of the
[40:08] the rough framework for The Gospel
[40:10] According to bitcoin um I I think one
[40:12] thing that again this like one one
[40:14] difference obviously is I mean with with
[40:18] the the Gospel of Jesus like you know
[40:20] it's the goal is to take it to every
[40:22] person on Earth and I think the same the
[40:24] same is true you know of Bitcoin to a
[40:26] degree um but like right now you know
[40:29] that again this I guess everyone on
[40:31] Earth doesn't have the same access to to
[40:33] Christianity either but so I guess that
[40:34] is a similarity but that that's kind of
[40:36] what I was going to say like whereas is
[40:37] Bitcoin like it requires it requires you
[40:40] having electricity like there there is
[40:42] like this precondition to having there's
[40:45] this precondition to being able to
[40:46] appreciate and use Bitcoin um and so
[40:48] maybe there's there's not the same kind
[40:50] of precondition to you know to
[40:51] understand uh Jesus like kind of God has
[40:53] already made the world to work a certain
[40:56] way that kind of serves as that that
[40:57] precursor so that would be that would be
[40:59] a difference I guess there are people
[41:01] there are people who like um I really
[41:04] funny we woke up uh Sunday morning and
[41:06] discovered that Max Kaiser uh retweeted
[41:08] a buddy of mine who who re he was
[41:11] recommending my uh our book and uh Max
[41:14] was one of the guys I had in mind when
[41:16] we were writing this thing because this
[41:18] is written for people who who don't who
[41:21] aren't Christians to help them explain
[41:23] like the similarities and and kind of to
[41:26] to
[41:27] for La of better word like help them
[41:29] come to know Jesus um in a personal way
[41:32] and so I was really encouraged to see
[41:34] that but like he's also said all of
[41:36] these things like he worships Bitcoin as
[41:40] God like he's literally is God Bitcoin
[41:42] is God like that was like a tweet of his
[41:43] like from a few months ago and so I'm
[41:45] just like o like I'm also I'm very
[41:47] thankful that like he's reading this
[41:49] book I hope he's reading this book
[41:50] because he recommended it um because
[41:52] he's the he's the the target audience in
[41:54] in a way but um yeah it also just shows
[41:57] that Bitcoin is not God Bitcoin and God
[42:00] are two very different things Bitcoin is
[42:01] a tool that I believe God has given us
[42:04] uh to uh and I'm so thankful for it this
[42:06] is why I say thank God for Bitcoin all
[42:07] the time because it restores my faith in
[42:10] humanity and it restores my faith in uh
[42:12] that God wants to give us good things
[42:14] and actually he he he wants good things
[42:16] for the people of Earth and uh and wants
[42:18] us to thrive and prosper and he believe
[42:20] and and have humans flourish and uh I
[42:23] believe that can happen on a Bitcoin
[42:25] standard why do you think people compare
[42:29] uh Bitcoin to God or maybe even like uh
[42:31] I I heard I had a guest on who was
[42:34] talking about uh s Nakamoto is John Nash
[42:38] and he always referred to him as the
[42:40] Prince of Peace uh which uh I never got
[42:43] so much hate comments on on YouTube
[42:46] saying Jesus is the prince of PE and
[42:48] like like a lot of a lot of them it's
[42:51] it's uncommon for me to get so much
[42:53] backlash uh so like uh um why why do
[42:56] people go that R of saying s Nakamoto is
[43:00] the prince of peace and like Bitcoin is
[43:02] God like why do you think that well I
[43:05] would just say when you see something
[43:07] that is so amazing and so glorious in a
[43:10] way there is a temptation to want to
[43:12] worship it we even see examples of this
[43:14] in scripture I believe it was uh was
[43:16] John the Apostle John he he he was met
[43:19] by an Angel and the angel was so
[43:22] beautiful and glorious that he actually
[43:23] bowed down and started to worship this
[43:25] thing and the angel had to stop him the
[43:26] angel was like like no don't worship me
[43:28] I'm just a messenger worship God and so
[43:31] I think that's potentially what's going
[43:33] on here because I have such such
[43:34] reverence for and such respect for
[43:36] Satoshi and for what he's created and I
[43:39] think it's just a a mindboggling
[43:41] invention that's going to change the
[43:42] world and already is changing the world
[43:44] and and so I think there is a natural
[43:46] temptation to to want to worship this
[43:49] and make this your everything in your
[43:51] life like what you worship is what you
[43:53] think about going to sleep is what you
[43:55] dedicate your life to and and all your
[43:57] thoughts and your actions and your your
[43:59] your money towards and so uh I could see
[44:01] why people would just utterly obsess
[44:04] over it and because it's so beautiful
[44:06] but um bitcoin's not there to say don't
[44:08] worship me worship God like the angel I
[44:12] wish it would yeah I think I think
[44:14] another part of it is you you have
[44:16] people who I mean especially younger
[44:18] people like again I'm I'm 37 you know
[44:21] like we Dan you're 4 early 40s like I
[44:23] don't know how old you are Rob we're
[44:25] younger people and like I mean things
[44:27] have been dark like things have been
[44:30] dark the last you know 20 years and
[44:32] obviously you could keep going back like
[44:34] there for a lot of people things have
[44:35] been dark and it just seems hopeless in
[44:36] a lot of ways because like governments
[44:38] are just so corrupt like they're they're
[44:40] populated you know by these older people
[44:43] who just are so disconnected they're
[44:45] career politicians largely you know they
[44:47] have to lie in order to get into office
[44:49] and so it's just really easy to be
[44:50] cynical uh and just feel like you know
[44:53] to feel like it's just hopeless to to
[44:55] really like the the possibility of just
[44:56] working hard and making a living in you
[44:59] know in your life being better than your
[45:01] life of your parents like for many of us
[45:03] it just seems kind of impossible uh and
[45:05] so to see Bitcoin you know Bitcoin is
[45:08] something that's rooted in honesty it's
[45:10] rooted in Truth uh you know it's rooted
[45:13] in just publicly displaying you know
[45:15] every transaction that's ever existed um
[45:18] you know like you you can't you know BS
[45:21] you can't BS with it and so I think for
[45:23] a lot of people you know it's the
[45:25] contrast is of of how amazing Bitcoin is
[45:28] with how dark everything else is I think
[45:30] for a lot of people they're finally it's
[45:31] like this sigh of relief of like gosh
[45:34] man finally there's something that's
[45:35] just you know something I something
[45:37] that's so you know uncorruptible uh or
[45:40] just you know it's so strong and
[45:43] foundational that you know I I I can
[45:46] deal with it without having to worry
[45:48] about these other people you know like I
[45:49] I don't have to depend on at least
[45:51] theoretically I don't have to depend on
[45:52] other people in order to use or maintain
[45:55] my Bitcoin and so I think for a lot of
[45:58] people it it's it's just been the stark
[45:59] contrast that's been the the reason why
[46:01] they're you know so tempted to worship
[46:03] it and like I said again and but even
[46:06] those terms is something that probably
[46:07] for a lot of you like like I don't I
[46:09] don't worship things and and really like
[46:11] this I mean if you look at the anemology
[46:13] of the word you know wor worship it's
[46:15] really the combination of two words it's
[46:17] worship and so to to worship something
[46:20] is basically to to declare whether you
[46:23] know verbally or just you know in terms
[46:25] of your your excitedness or whatever
[46:27] like to to declare the worth of
[46:29] something um and so you know you could
[46:30] say this thing is is worthy of being you
[46:33] know worthy of being appreciated or
[46:35] worthy worthy of being um you know loved
[46:38] or appreciated and so I I think that you
[46:40] know there's a real sense in which
[46:41] there's a there's a healthy sense of
[46:43] that there's a healthy sense in which
[46:44] you know we we can you know see our
[46:46] parents you know in in the best case
[46:48] scenarios or we can see our kids and we
[46:50] can see you know and just appreciate
[46:52] their value and and their goodness um
[46:55] but again all of these things it's it's
[46:57] not a matter of you know is it is it
[46:58] wrong to to you know appreciate these
[47:01] things it's just a matter of degrees
[47:03] it's a matter of you know like what is
[47:04] the what is the hierarchical structure
[47:06] of our loves and of the things that we
[47:09] you know um you know the things that we
[47:11] we prioritize in our in our lives and so
[47:14] I think that that's what a lot of a lot
[47:15] of us and a lot of especially people who
[47:17] aren't coming you know they're they're
[47:19] coming at Bitcoin from maybe a a
[47:22] strictly uh you economic background or a
[47:24] strictly computer background you know uh
[47:26] you know programming background or
[47:27] whatever you know if if I think this is
[47:29] where all of us can help each other
[47:31] because I think they're you know this
[47:32] this subject of the ethics of money
[47:34] production and the subject of um you
[47:36] know just ethical reasoning and moral
[47:38] reasoning I think like this is this is
[47:40] really a core tenant of Bitcoin but it's
[47:42] something that most people haven't
[47:44] studied and so they don't when they it's
[47:45] not the first thing that comes to mind
[47:47] when they when they think about Bitcoin
[47:48] and so again that's kind of what we we
[47:50] want this book to be is like kind of
[47:51] like a you know a a helpful tool in the
[47:54] toolbox that can help you you know help
[47:56] people appreciate and think about you
[47:58] know the ideas and the uh yeah just the
[48:02] the the ideas and the the moral and
[48:04] ethical and and you know our case like
[48:06] scriptural principles that actually
[48:07] undergird something that just doesn't NE
[48:10] doesn't doesn't necessarily look
[48:12] spiritual like when you think about
[48:13] Bitcoin you don't you don't necessarily
[48:16] the average person doesn't go oh yes
[48:18] spiritual you know they and and so we're
[48:20] just kind of trying to help translate
[48:22] you know to help people look at you know
[48:24] B Bitcoin through our eyes and and you
[48:27] know in kind of appreciate why we we
[48:29] think the way that we do it's also
[48:31] fascinating for me that uh hope.com is a
[48:35] Bitcoin side like that because like what
[48:37] you described is also like uh people get
[48:40] Bitcoin and then they get like this hope
[48:43] again of like the the world is so dark
[48:45] and uh we we're kind of playing that by
[48:48] the way I'm 26 so oh yeah oh man look at
[48:51] you I'm I'm I'm I'm way too young for
[48:53] the Bitcoin Community I I see my I I see
[48:56] my statistic on on who's my audience and
[48:59] I have over 50% of my audience above 45
[49:03] years old let's go so the average viewer
[49:07] is around six 46 47 years old so the
[49:11] average viewer is 21 years older than
[49:14] than than me wow you're an old soul
[49:17] Robin I'm an old soul yeah uh really
[49:21] cool um maybe let's get into this uh
[49:24] because time is just flying very very
[49:26] quickly by and and it feels like we we
[49:29] we just barely touched the topic um uh
[49:32] for for bitcoiners who are like Max K
[49:35] are so saying Bitcoin is God and and for
[49:38] others that are maybe just not uh in
[49:41] into religion at all maybe even like me
[49:43] who who are uh really into Bitcoin but
[49:47] aren't uh necessarily extremely into
[49:50] into religion uh why why Christianity
[49:54] why should uh a bitcoiner go down that
[49:57] rabbit hole why Christianity that's
[49:59] that's a great question um I I think
[50:02] it's it's fundamental question of of
[50:04] life it you want to know why am I here
[50:07] what what's my purpose in life why do I
[50:09] exist um the first chapter we have in
[50:12] this book it's uh called dear bitcoiner
[50:14] and it it goes into this uh it's kind of
[50:17] this obscure part of scripture in in the
[50:21] book of Peter first Peter where Peter's
[50:23] talking to uh an audience that is it's
[50:25] under heavy persecution so they're
[50:26] living under the Romans under one of the
[50:29] the worst um Emperors at the time who
[50:30] was persecuting Christians actively so
[50:32] he's writing into people who are like
[50:35] seeing their families like killed and
[50:37] displaced and it's just uh really awful
[50:39] environment and he writes to them and he
[50:43] he says he he talks to them about the
[50:45] end of the world that's coming he says
[50:47] that that everything is going to be
[50:49] eventually burned up in a fire and and
[50:51] we're going to see Jesus come back and
[50:54] this is kind of the future that's
[50:55] awaiting you so like the the thing that
[50:57] you're the things that you're going
[50:58] through right now they're not going to
[51:00] last forever but we're going to see
[51:02] you're going to see relief you're going
[51:03] to see an alleviation to the suffering
[51:05] and all those things are going to come
[51:06] to an end and then he says he says this
[51:08] with an eye at the end of the world
[51:10] knowing like what's going to come
[51:12] knowing that things that there's like
[51:13] going to be a big a big change in the
[51:15] system and the current regime can't
[51:16] stand knowing that um who ought you to
[51:19] be he says this phrase who ought you to
[51:22] be and so it's interesting because like
[51:24] he's not telling them to you know start
[51:27] prepping for the end of the world
[51:28] collecting water getting guns buying
[51:31] land all that stuff he's saying check
[51:33] your character check who you are as a
[51:35] person and I think this is the a
[51:37] fundamental question in all of our
[51:39] hearts in our lives is we want to know
[51:41] you got the chapter there uh who we are
[51:44] and we want to know who and and there's
[51:46] a quote by St Augustine uh where he says
[51:48] uh let me know you God and let me know
[51:51] myself and I believe Augustine who one
[51:54] of the patron STS one one of the the
[51:56] biggest fig in Christianity after
[51:58] obviously after Jesus um he believed
[52:00] that you couldn't really know God unless
[52:02] you came to know yourself and you can't
[52:04] really know yourself unless you know God
[52:06] and so this is basically just an
[52:08] invitation to explore that it's an
[52:10] invitation to explore uh knowing
[52:13] yourself better and knowing god better
[52:15] because you you really can't can you
[52:17] like can you fully know who you are if
[52:18] you don't know who created you and you
[52:20] don't know the person who created you
[52:21] and this is what Christianity offers it
[52:22] offers you a chance to actually connect
[52:24] with your creator in a personal way and
[52:26] so I I would say that's probably the
[52:28] message and and why why we should want
[52:31] to know God I love that there's other
[52:35] ways we could express that too but maybe
[52:36] Jordan you can get into it yeah again I
[52:39] think that so there's there's a um
[52:41] there's a scientist named Dr Steven
[52:43] Meyer he's been on Joe Rogan's podcast
[52:45] he's you know done a number of podcast
[52:46] he's written a bunch of books um but one
[52:48] of the things he talks about uh he talks
[52:50] about basically like he he's talking
[52:52] about just basically the history of the
[52:54] world and you know people and where do
[52:55] we come from all these kind of things
[52:57] these existential questions um again
[52:59] they do work themselves out in your
[53:00] lives like what you believe about you
[53:03] know Ultimate Reality and about why
[53:04] you're here and about you know what's
[53:06] going on will have it will necessarily
[53:08] have impacts on how you live so like
[53:10] there's people who you know some of
[53:11] these people you people who are
[53:12] nihilists like they go on some of these
[53:14] people who have been nihilist they go on
[53:15] killing spres and they kill people
[53:16] because they're like if if you know if
[53:18] this life is all that matters there's
[53:20] nothing after it's just darkness and
[53:21] Blackness well then who cares what we do
[53:24] um and so I think like really this is
[53:26] just a reality what you believe about
[53:28] Ultimate Reality will flush itself out
[53:30] and there are conceptions of Ultimate
[53:32] Reality that are that are more aligned
[53:34] with how the world actually works than
[53:36] others uh and so this is something that
[53:38] again we we live in a day and age where
[53:40] telling people that they're wrong is
[53:41] kind of like the worst thing that you
[53:42] could ever say to someone like it's kind
[53:45] of like you don't want to offend them
[53:47] and so a lot of times we avoid
[53:48] conversations about these because we're
[53:50] like well in the past there were Wars
[53:51] that were fought over these things um
[53:54] and so we want to avoid Wars you know
[53:55] like this is we want to avoid people
[53:57] being offended and obviously there's a
[53:59] healthy degree to which you know it's we
[54:01] shouldn't just pursue every argument for
[54:03] the sake of argument we shouldn't pursue
[54:05] argumentation for the sake of you know
[54:07] people thinking that we're great or for
[54:08] the sake of our own pride and our own
[54:10] Glory uh but at the same time like there
[54:12] there are reasons why we ought to pursue
[54:15] you know truth wherever it leads um and
[54:17] so I think that one of the things that's
[54:19] happened is in the last especially
[54:21] within the the Western countries within
[54:22] the last 100 years you know there's
[54:24] there's things that Christianity you
[54:26] know Christianity is the foundation for
[54:28] much of the western the Western
[54:30] Hemisphere like we we you know the the F
[54:32] the Constitutions and the the law codes
[54:34] were built upon the the Christian
[54:36] understanding of the way that the world
[54:38] works and I think what's happened is you
[54:40] have a lot of these countries that you
[54:42] know have lost the the heart of kind of
[54:45] what we were talking about earlier
[54:46] they've lost the heart of you know why
[54:48] do we do these things and they're
[54:49] focusing only on what is actually
[54:51] written and that lack of context leaves
[54:54] them ashamed of of some the things that
[54:56] are written uh and so you have this this
[55:00] you know temptation to just despise the
[55:02] the faith of our forefathers that
[55:04] founded the countries that we you know
[55:06] in the found founded the countries and
[55:07] the freedoms that we take for granted uh
[55:09] and so I think part of this part of this
[55:11] thing when I when I look at this and I
[55:13] look at the history of you know fiat
[55:14] currency it sh it doesn't it shouldn't
[55:16] surprise anyone it doesn't surprise me
[55:19] that the most secular moment arguably in
[55:21] human history I I don't even think it's
[55:22] arguable like the most secular moment in
[55:25] human history is corresponding with Peak
[55:28] fiat currency like when you think about
[55:30] it's it's because again if if
[55:32] governments if value can be created by
[55:35] governments and Central Bankers out of
[55:36] thin air then functionally they are the
[55:39] gods of the system and if they are able
[55:42] to again use that money that they create
[55:44] out of thin air to subsidize any idea
[55:47] any idea in the world they can subsidize
[55:49] it by by throwing you know madeup money
[55:51] at it um then again you're going to have
[55:53] signal
[55:54] confusion and you're going to have a
[55:56] high degree of signal confusion out in
[55:58] the world for what is real and what is
[56:00] true and so I think that this is
[56:01] something where again without even
[56:02] getting into evaluating you know like
[56:05] the the truthfulness or whatever of
[56:06] these of these questions the fact that
[56:08] we live in a world where there is so
[56:10] much legitimate confusion that we should
[56:12] have legitimate sympathy over over like
[56:14] questions of what does it mean to be a
[56:16] man or what does it mean to be a woman
[56:18] or what does it mean what is a
[56:19] government you know what is money we
[56:21] have all of these we're I talk about
[56:23] this all the time like we're in
[56:23] existential crisis we don't know what
[56:25] anything is because we've rejected
[56:28] broadly uh We've rejected the idea that
[56:31] there is some sort of objective standard
[56:33] by which we can know truthfulness um we
[56:36] can know something as being true and and
[56:38] Truth isn't just a question of uh this
[56:40] is my perspective and this is what I
[56:42] think about the world um and so I think
[56:44] that this is a big part of of the issues
[56:47] that we have and so you know in in this
[56:49] world in a world where it's very
[56:51] unpopular and um you know Politically
[56:54] Incorrect to to say
[56:57] uh you know this is the truth and this
[56:59] is false you have Jesus who comes along
[57:02] uh with you know again he comes along
[57:04] with a message where he says I am the
[57:06] way the truth and the life no man comes
[57:09] to the father but through me and so you
[57:13] have and again that was a radical
[57:14] message in Jesus's Day Jesus was put to
[57:16] death because he said this message and
[57:18] there were people who said he's making
[57:19] himself to he's making himself out to be
[57:21] God and that that was what he was doing
[57:24] he was making himself to making himself
[57:26] out to be God and it was a radical semi
[57:29] unhinged if he's not who he says he is
[57:31] it's an unhinged thing to say it's every
[57:33] bit as is seemingly unhinged today and
[57:37] yet that same message you know within a
[57:39] couple generations of the first time
[57:41] that Jesus spoke it you know
[57:42] Christianity had taken over the Roman
[57:44] Empire it had unseeded the most powerful
[57:47] Empire in the world up to that point uh
[57:49] and so now it's become again you you
[57:51] guys are you know in countries that were
[57:52] founded by founded by Christians and you
[57:54] know that had where Christianity
[57:56] uh the New Testament and the Old
[57:58] Testament had you know played huge roles
[57:59] in the formation uh of of the thinking
[58:02] and the rule the law codes and all these
[58:04] kind of things so I I think that again
[58:06] part of this is just part of the reason
[58:08] people ought to be interested in this
[58:09] because this is just it's about learning
[58:11] where you came from if you if you live
[58:14] in a western country learning more about
[58:16] Christianity is helping you understand
[58:17] more about where you came from now
[58:19] obviously there's been things that have
[58:20] been done in the name of Christianity or
[58:22] you know by governments or whatever who
[58:24] had Christian foundations who that
[58:26] weren't aligned with Christianity I mean
[58:28] we we could we don't need to look very
[58:30] far back in human history to to you know
[58:32] to realize that but that doesn't mean
[58:34] that it's not worth you know doing the
[58:37] Deep dive and and you know going down
[58:38] and looking at again what are the
[58:40] foundational documents here like let's
[58:42] let's you know dive into the scriptures
[58:43] and like let's look at the history of
[58:45] these things um there's a tremendous
[58:46] amount of value even from that you know
[58:48] even from that limited scope you know
[58:51] approach but as as Dan was talking about
[58:53] like again these are we have been able
[58:55] to avoid
[58:56] deep difficult potentially divisive
[58:59] questions for a very long time in the
[59:01] name of pragmatism like pragmatism of
[59:04] listen we all got to eat we all got to
[59:05] have money you know like just give
[59:07] people money and that'll that'll give
[59:09] them peace just give them Sports give
[59:10] them you know football like they'll
[59:12] that'll that'll bring about peace and
[59:14] we're coming to the point where those
[59:16] things aren't aren't aren't plating
[59:19] everybody like they were before like
[59:21] it's getting people are things are
[59:22] getting hard you can only deny reality
[59:24] for so long and so I think that you know
[59:26] we're we're getting to the point where
[59:27] you're having larger and larger Stakes
[59:31] divisions and discussions and so again I
[59:34] think that we're we're getting to the
[59:35] point where people are recognizing wait
[59:36] what you believe about the world
[59:37] actually matters and and we need to
[59:39] figure out what's actually true because
[59:41] when we just try to pretend like it
[59:42] doesn't actually matter you know you you
[59:45] get really difficult discussions uh that
[59:47] that really are untenable and uh the the
[59:51] short thing that you also like there
[59:52] were a lot of
[59:54] things in the uh but but two things I
[59:57] got out is also Christianity and
[59:59] responsibility I I I love that aspect I
[60:02] never looked looked at that way because
[60:04] Bitcoin also gives you that
[60:05] responsibility if you screw up your
[60:07] private Keys you will never see those
[60:08] Bitcoin again yeah uh if you send it to
[60:10] a scammer you never see those Bitcoin
[60:12] again and stuff like that so
[60:15] yeah I sent Bitcoin to a scammer when I
[60:18] first got into Bitcoin lost like really
[60:21] I think like a tenth of a Bitcoin in did
[60:22] he give you two back that that was the
[60:24] that was the promise again I no I didn't
[60:26] understand any of this it was the worst
[60:28] it was the worst yeah and people get
[60:30] scammed uh still today with with bitco
[60:33] thing and that's that's other thing you
[60:35] you said like people misuse Christianity
[60:38] the good name of Christianity and people
[60:40] misuse the good name of Bitcoin people
[60:42] are and I um I had to deal with that uh
[60:47] personally because people want to come
[60:49] on my podcast they want to promote some
[60:52] kind of scam misusing the good name of
[60:54] Bitcoin I go on website and like oh like
[60:57] Bitcoin some money you go down and down
[60:59] and then they're selling something not
[61:01] related to bitcoin at all it's just like
[61:03] some weird scam and I'm like oh no sorry
[61:06] I I I try to keep keep the signal here
[61:09] uh so there is a lot of um scams out
[61:12] there that use a good brand name uh and
[61:16] misuse it for their own uh good and and
[61:19] that that's just that's just sad and
[61:21] it's it gives you like Bitcoin and
[61:24] Christianity gives you a lot of Hope for
[61:27] for the world and kind of this this
[61:28] slide where you're going and asking
[61:30] those bigger question like who who who
[61:32] am I yeah I I think again like it's
[61:35] difficult it's difficult right because
[61:37] there there's there's value in knowing
[61:39] the truth but it's difficult to access
[61:42] the truth when you have other values and
[61:45] people pursuing other values that can
[61:47] kind of confuse because again it's just
[61:49] difficult like why would somebody you
[61:51] know why would somebody just care about
[61:52] money more than knowing the truth you
[61:54] know why would somebody do that like for
[61:56] a lot of people that you know that is
[61:57] Unthinkable they they don't do that but
[61:59] then there's plenty of people where they
[62:00] do and so that it just confuses the
[62:02] signal and it's difficult for people to
[62:04] to understand what's real so are you
[62:06] talking about Trump coin correct that's
[62:09] actually that's absolutely correct
[62:10] there's a lot of people who are going to
[62:11] associate Bitcoin and think it's
[62:13] ridiculous because of its proximity to
[62:14] Trump and and trumpcoin and so yeah
[62:17] that's again we need to be willing to
[62:18] call out you know call out scammers
[62:20] wherever they're found even if we you
[62:22] know aren't even if they're spoken by
[62:24] people who we agree with some of things
[62:26] that they do yeah yeah and I think I
[62:29] think Trump has uh a little to no
[62:32] knowledge of of the Trump coin he was
[62:35] recently asked about it uh and and his
[62:38] question was like oh did we launch it oh
[62:41] how successful is it the reporter was
[62:43] like oh you made
[62:45] billions and his answer was like
[62:47] billions those are bean nuts for for
[62:49] them something some ridiculous answers
[62:51] like that uh so I think it's it's it's a
[62:55] small project project that's maybe
[62:57] occupying 0.01% of your of his brain and
[63:02] is run by someone else like I wouldn't
[63:04] over like it it gives him and the
[63:08] administration a little bit of a bad rap
[63:09] for bitcoiners yeah to be honest like
[63:12] that that kind of makes it hard to say
[63:15] like oh Trump is a bitcoiner when he
[63:17] does those things but I I wouldn't also
[63:20] overestimate what that means for for
[63:22] this
[63:23] Administration yeah that's helpful
[63:25] perspective yeah and again he's he's L
[63:27] his entire career has been farming out
[63:29] his name to shill other products like he
[63:31] sells his name to somebody who's going
[63:33] to make Stakes like Trump's not there
[63:35] you know checking cows to make sure that
[63:36] they're good quality cows to you like
[63:39] yeah it's just this it's just him
[63:40] farming out his name and selling it and
[63:42] he just had no I I don't think he had
[63:44] any concept of how successful this thing
[63:46] was going to be to the you know to the
[63:48] point that somebody tweeted that at
[63:50] least as of the first day the the wallet
[63:53] that Trump held I believe the value was
[63:55] like billion so like 20 times his
[63:59] existing net worth he made in one day
[64:01] with this dumb token so yeah it's I
[64:04] don't think he has any conception of of
[64:06] of the success yeah it still has a
[64:09] ridiculous value it's uh it's it's oh uh
[64:14] a market cap of8 billion dollar it's
[64:16] it's it's uh it's it's still ridiculous
[64:19] I I don't I don't like fully delute the
[64:22] market cap versus real market cap I I
[64:24] don't know what what bance is here are
[64:26] saying but like it it has a market cap
[64:28] of 8 billion and a fully diluted market
[64:30] cap of 40 billion whatever this means uh
[64:33] so it obviously is is ridiculous uh but
[64:37] also it's kind of the free market of
[64:40] like yeah if you buy Trump coin it's
[64:42] it's your thing um you will probably
[64:44] very very probably get burned really
[64:47] really badly uh and that's a lesson for
[64:49] yourself yeah yeah yeah Trump's not all
[64:52] bad I mean hey Ross is walking free
[64:54] today he's he's he was freed yesterday
[64:57] so yep got got to got to give credit
[65:00] where credits do you like he held his
[65:02] promise absolutely and and he put a full
[65:05] uh B on uh how how do you say yeah he
[65:09] supposed to just commute a sentence
[65:11] basically like you know time served but
[65:12] he gave him a full pardon which is you
[65:13] know beyond what he what he said he was
[65:15] gonna do that's that's great yeah and
[65:17] then he called out the Deep state which
[65:19] is just yeah that was wild yeah yeah and
[65:24] he also is getting out of the uh the
[65:27] World Health Organization and and and
[65:30] those things like I I think he does some
[65:32] interesting uh really good stuff uh uh
[65:34] for for America and I hope that that
[65:37] Europe looks at all the good stuff that
[65:40] Trump is doing uh and kind of takes it
[65:43] to Europe because I don't I don't always
[65:46] like what the EU is doing mostly
[65:49] actually not yeah fun yeah it's one of
[65:52] these things where I think Whitney web
[65:54] tweeted about tweeted about this she
[65:56] said that um I guess Trump left the The
[65:59] Who last time he was in office too but
[66:01] then just like diverted the funds to
[66:03] another like another vaccine like
[66:05] another it was some organization that
[66:07] basically was doing a lot of the same
[66:08] type of things like it ended up it
[66:10] wasn't like they just cold turkey sto so
[66:12] but yeah I think that it's just
[66:13] following up on you've got a lot of
[66:15] people again the last time Trump was in
[66:17] office you know the the whole again I
[66:20] don't know what we're what we're safe to
[66:21] say for uh for ad purposes for you so
[66:24] like the the events of 20 20 um you know
[66:27] the early 2020s I I think like people
[66:30] hadn't gone through that yet and I just
[66:32] think more and more people like we just
[66:33] don't trust anybody anymore which like
[66:36] again can be super unhealthy and
[66:38] unhelpful to in some ways but you know I
[66:41] think that a lot of people are
[66:42] recognizing like they have to take
[66:44] responsibility for themselves like they
[66:46] have to take responsibility for their
[66:47] lives you know for for what they you
[66:49] know what they think and what they
[66:50] believe um and yeah I just think people
[66:53] a lot of people are are waking up I mean
[66:55] there's scandals in the UK about like
[66:57] these you know like different you know
[67:00] gangs that were doing things over the
[67:01] past of the course 20 years and and I
[67:03] think people are waking up there too so
[67:05] again I I just think this this you know
[67:08] the Awakening of responsibility is going
[67:11] to have lot it's a it's something that
[67:13] needs to happen and we see it happening
[67:15] all over the place I think it could end
[67:17] up in the resulting in the delution of
[67:19] of the EU within the next you know 10
[67:21] years just given a lot of the a lot of
[67:23] the forces at play and and again I think
[67:26] that obviously that's going to have some
[67:27] downsides but again people taking
[67:30] responsibility for their for their own
[67:31] lives and then their own governance I
[67:33] think is is you know nothing but a good
[67:36] thing absolutely um as we coming closer
[67:39] to the end uh with with two people uh
[67:42] Andro teams usually take twice as
[67:44] [Laughter]
[67:46] long um I have one question I would like
[67:49] to each ask you that question actually
[67:51] that I ask each and every one of my
[67:52] guests and that uh is the question of
[67:54] what can we learn from besides Bitcoin
[67:56] and I would add with you to uh what can
[67:59] we learn from you besides Bitcoin and
[68:02] Christianity oh boy who wants to start
[68:05] outside of your two favorite topics what
[68:07] uh what can we learn for is like are you
[68:10] looking for personal things like like
[68:11] hobbies and stuff like that there are
[68:13] two different ways that I see people
[68:15] going about that the the first thing is
[68:17] like something personal that we can
[68:18] learn actually about you as a person but
[68:20] the other thing uh that uh people also
[68:23] go about is like some some learning some
[68:25] things uh that that you got along the
[68:28] way of of your life Journey that you you
[68:30] can share uh I I had a lot of I like
[68:33] that question uh uh because uh a lot of
[68:37] people take it different
[68:39] ways uh and I was like oh I I will keep
[68:43] that uh maybe I'll switch it around a
[68:45] little bit but I I want to get something
[68:48] outside of Bitcoin and the podcast which
[68:50] is
[68:51] always more difficult when we already
[68:54] have such a huge topic outside of
[68:56] Bitcoin in the podcast like today uh but
[68:58] they still trying to to get maybe
[69:00] something new out if you're ready Jordan
[69:02] you go ahead I'm still thinking man um
[69:06] yeah I don't know I think I would say
[69:08] this is a man it's a great question uh I
[69:10] would probably say something about I
[69:11] mean just being a parent I think that
[69:13] one of the most helpful Frameworks for
[69:15] me of just thinking just helped me
[69:16] understand and think about Bitcoin has
[69:17] been through my kids and just thinking
[69:20] about um you know just like what what it
[69:23] means to be a kid and just like you know
[69:26] what trying to parent and like trying to
[69:27] figure out how to be a a good parent and
[69:29] trying to think about you know what does
[69:31] it what does it mean to you to parent
[69:33] well what does it mean to to be a you
[69:35] know a good husband as well I think like
[69:37] a lot of these things of my
[69:38] understandings of them have been have
[69:39] been challenged by um challenged by
[69:42] Bitcoin and and again just challenged
[69:44] through understanding money more broadly
[69:46] yeah so I mean I I just would recommend
[69:48] it I would recommend uh you know have
[69:51] getting married and having kids you know
[69:52] if if possible obviously no not
[69:54] everybody's in a situation where can and
[69:56] um you know we have friends who are
[69:57] married and can't have kids or you know
[69:58] people who want to get married who
[69:59] haven't gotten married but uh yeah I
[70:01] think that uh yeah I think that we're we
[70:04] live in a world in which you know I
[70:06] don't know people are it's it's it's
[70:08] made fun of this idea of having family
[70:10] and especially starting younger like of
[70:13] having families it's kind of made fun of
[70:14] or just trivialized and and but I again
[70:17] I think I see a I've seen just so with
[70:19] even within the Bitcoin Community like a
[70:21] an Awakening of of people appreciating
[70:24] the value of of children
[70:26] um in the value of again of
[70:28] relationships and uh yeah again I just
[70:30] think it's been it's been an encouraging
[70:32] thing and again it's it's not that it's
[70:33] easy like it's it's hard you know waking
[70:37] up and you know living with you know
[70:39] other people who have their own wills
[70:40] and have their own desires is difficult
[70:42] but it's a it's a difficulty that's
[70:44] worth uh you know worth enduring and
[70:48] worth you know growing through um so
[70:50] marriage and kids go for it the yeah the
[70:54] the the family unit is is I kind of so
[70:58] underappreciate it it's something so
[71:00] important and it's it's the one thing
[71:03] that sticks with you whole whole your
[71:05] life uh like the the partners around you
[71:08] uh and and the family unit in itself
[71:10] it's it's it's something uh I'm I'm I'm
[71:13] fairly passionate about even though I'm
[71:15] very young so like yeah obviously I
[71:17] don't have kids I'm not married yet uh
[71:20] so but I I'm planning to do those things
[71:23] definitely yeah is going to talk about
[71:26] something stupid like hockey but uh do
[71:29] it do it get forget no well CU like you
[71:32] think about like things that shape your
[71:34] life like Bitcoin and Christianity have
[71:35] shaped my life tremendously but like the
[71:37] other other big thing would be would be
[71:40] my family would be my wife actually
[71:42] funny story so I get home the other day
[71:44] um from I was taking my kids out to uh
[71:46] my two older kids to Jiu-Jitsu and uh
[71:49] and my youngest daughter uh she uh
[71:52] wanted to play princess and so uh my
[71:54] wife
[71:55] um she dawned her wedding dress for the
[71:58] first time in 13 years since our wedding
[72:01] and so I get home and I walk in the door
[72:02] and I literally I I was speechless I I
[72:05] just went slack jaw because I was like I
[72:07] hadn't seen her wear that since like we
[72:10] literally were walking down the aisle
[72:12] and uh I was like Wow and it just gave
[72:14] me this renewed appreciation for her and
[72:16] for uh for the family that we've created
[72:18] and I just think yeah what a gift from
[72:20] from God that the fact that uh that that
[72:23] marriage exists and she's just been um
[72:25] been an amazing partner for me and uh so
[72:28] thankful for her and but it's also been
[72:30] like we've also had like some we like we
[72:33] had probably probably the biggest fights
[72:34] of our of our entire marriage like just
[72:37] a few months ago and uh it was just the
[72:41] dumbest thing but uh and in retrospect
[72:44] we're both laughing at it now but uh but
[72:45] it's also been it's been a very refining
[72:47] process of like learning uh my how I
[72:51] need to to grow as a human and learn how
[72:54] to communicate better and uh and yeah
[72:57] you throw in parenting on top of that
[72:58] and it's just like there's so many so
[73:00] many possibilities for uh for things to
[73:04] uh to blow up but um yeah just it's been
[73:07] an amazing um amazing uh Journey with
[73:09] with my wife and and having a family I'm
[73:11] so thankful for that so hle in in the
[73:14] same ways you have to endure uh bare
[73:16] markets in Bitcoin you have to endure
[73:18] you know endure the bare markets of uh
[73:19] of relationships yeah like they are
[73:22] there are some dark there are some dark
[73:24] you know Dark Times and yeah yeah and
[73:26] again yeah I would just encourage people
[73:29] yeah don't up but go for it it's worth
[73:32] it I love the the comparison with h and
[73:35] it's uh it's super interesting for me I
[73:38] mean I'm uh I I haven't gone through
[73:41] parenting at all and I think parenting
[73:43] what I hear from uh people that have
[73:46] gone through is the parenting is the
[73:48] biggest challenge not only in your life
[73:50] but also in your
[73:51] relationship uh and it it's really uh
[73:55] the most fascinating thing what I heard
[73:57] from an uncle was like they had three
[74:00] kids and they got them quite next to
[74:03] each other like two three years apart
[74:05] each kid uh and after the the last kid
[74:08] was kind of above like uh 10 years old
[74:12] uh he got to know his wife again uh he's
[74:15] like the if you have so many kids and
[74:17] you have work uh you kind of uh lose
[74:19] sight of each other because you're just
[74:21] there for the kids you're just there to
[74:23] provide for the house for the the work
[74:25] and everything like that uh so there's a
[74:27] lot of challenging Parts I think for for
[74:30] a marriage uh from from the beginning
[74:33] till the end and I think hling through
[74:35] that is is really um something
[74:39] remarkable and it always is uh amazing
[74:42] to see if you see like online uh people
[74:45] that have been to together for like 70
[74:47] years or even like my grand uh dad and
[74:50] mom who are like there for like 50 years
[74:53] together and stuff like that is like so
[74:55] inspiring um uh that's that's kind of
[74:58] the the end goal that that if you
[75:00] achieve that in life you you really like
[75:03] achieved something beautiful I think at
[75:05] least yeah and it's one of these things
[75:07] where again like you like you always
[75:08] want to imagine like the wor I'm sure
[75:10] there's people who listening this who
[75:11] have like the worst story you can
[75:12] possibly imagine and like we're not
[75:14] we're not trying to idealize this thing
[75:16] or just act like you know you're a bad
[75:18] person like if you you know you have a
[75:20] story that involves you know divorce or
[75:22] something like that like we're not
[75:23] trying to trivialize any of those things
[75:25] like we we totally get it um so yeah
[75:28] just just that little Pro you know
[75:31] provision I just wanted to add that
[75:33] that's very important yeah I I'm I'm
[75:34] myself my parents are divorced so yeah
[75:37] yeah again like I'm a kid of divorced
[75:40] 100% And so again I think that's the
[75:41] other thing you just appreciate is you
[75:44] know it's it's really easy to to judge
[75:46] your own parents you know like even if
[75:48] they were great parents it's easy to
[75:49] just focus on the difficult things but
[75:51] then having your own kids you're like oh
[75:53] dang like it
[75:55] there's a lot that goes to it and it
[75:57] just gives you you know an appreciation
[75:59] again no matter what the situation like
[76:00] we you know we've got I've got really
[76:02] close friends whose parents are divorced
[76:04] and again we there still are things that
[76:05] you can appreciate you know even if even
[76:07] if things ended ended badly like again
[76:09] just realizing that you know if you know
[76:11] even if whether it's even whether or not
[76:13] you have parents or not there's people
[76:14] who are raised by their grandparents and
[76:16] just whoever raised you like there's
[76:18] there's a lot of just difficulty and and
[76:21] self-denial you know involved in raising
[76:24] other people people and so you know if
[76:26] you have people in your life who who
[76:27] have been willing to you know put
[76:29] themselves through that and you know to
[76:31] varying degrees of of success um you
[76:33] know it's something that you can be
[76:34] grateful for and I think there's a m
[76:36] there's a maturity that uh that produces
[76:38] in you of just you know realizing um
[76:41] that life is
[76:43] hard life is really hard and uh yeah we
[76:47] we again it's not an excuse for anybody
[76:50] but like we we just I mean giving each
[76:51] other Grace and being patient with each
[76:53] other in the face of you know weakness
[76:55] in face of Trials and all these kind of
[76:57] things is just really
[76:58] important it's kind of a hard thing of
[77:00] like um you you want to hold on to it um
[77:05] but there are certain situations where
[77:07] it's like oh like that's that's a toxic
[77:09] relationship that that's like something
[77:11] you actually should get out there and
[77:14] and and uh yeah it's it's interesting I
[77:18] want to close that with with one more
[77:20] thing even though we we're getting
[77:22] really long but um do you have
[77:25] uh you're both married I presume yeah
[77:29] both kids
[77:30] MH uh do you have any uh tips for
[77:34] younger guys like me uh that are just
[77:36] starting out on that journey of uh
[77:39] probably getting married uh quite soon
[77:41] in like the next few years uh going onto
[77:45] this journey as as a bitcoiner and and
[77:47] all those things do you have any uh tips
[77:49] I know we if you if you have a chance to
[77:52] go through any kind of like premarital
[77:54] counsel Ling if you're like getting
[77:56] ready for that I would highly suggest it
[77:58] especially with someone you trust
[77:59] someone you know who's like got a good
[78:01] marriage I for for us it was uh the
[78:03] pastor who married my wife and I went
[78:05] through that with us one of the things
[78:06] he really emphasized that stuck with me
[78:09] was just this this uh emphasis on like
[78:13] taking your expectations and throwing
[78:16] them out the window if you if you throw
[78:18] your expectations out the window and
[78:21] your your fiance future future spouse
[78:24] takes their their their expectations and
[78:26] throws them out the window then you come
[78:27] together and just let let your
[78:30] relationship be what it becomes and you
[78:32] put the other person first um it could
[78:34] just be a beautiful thing but if you've
[78:36] got all these expectations like she's
[78:37] going to fulfill me in these certain
[78:39] ways and like she's going to always cook
[78:41] all the meals I don't know what it is
[78:42] like those things like those things
[78:44] should really become through through you
[78:46] should make agreements on those things
[78:47] through mutual understanding and and not
[78:49] by your own expectations walking into it
[78:51] and so I'd probably uh say that yet
[78:54] throw your expectations out the window I
[78:56] I I thought when you started the
[78:57] sentence I thought like you going to a
[79:00] prenup yeah I don't recommend prenups
[79:03] unless unless you got like 11 Yachts
[79:05] maybe maybe you maybe saor would need a
[79:08] prenup I don't know yeah I I think I
[79:10] think again we we mentioned like the
[79:11] definitional crisis like we don't know
[79:13] what anything is and I think one of the
[79:14] other things that we don't we don't know
[79:15] what it is either again we all coming
[79:17] out with different definitions like what
[79:18] what is marriage even mean like what
[79:20] what is this thing like what why does it
[79:21] exist you know there's a lot of people
[79:23] who at least in the United States like
[79:24] the primary reason they get married is
[79:26] because there's tax advantages you know
[79:28] to for being married rather than like
[79:29] they they would they would just live
[79:31] together for years if there weren't tax
[79:32] advantages to getting married and so I
[79:34] think that that what kind of what Dan
[79:35] was talking about is just really
[79:36] important like you know just again even
[79:39] before you throw them out the window
[79:40] like examine what they are like you know
[79:43] what do you what are your beliefs about
[79:44] marriage like what are the purposes how
[79:45] do you think that it works and why um
[79:48] you know what do you do when you come to
[79:49] disagreements you know like like these
[79:51] things seem like super trivial and
[79:53] obvious but you know it again the you
[79:56] know when you assume you make an ass out
[79:57] of you and me you know it's kind of this
[79:59] old you know joke about assuming and so
[80:01] I think that again like basically
[80:04] talking about what your expectations are
[80:06] and then like again finding finding
[80:08] somebody you trust who's got a marriage
[80:09] you trust you know who can help you
[80:11] think about some of these things again
[80:13] like this makes sense right like when
[80:14] you go to college if you're going to be
[80:16] a doctor you go and you study under
[80:18] other doctors uh if you're going to be
[80:21] whatever you're going to do you go to
[80:22] people who are actually experts I
[80:23] hopefully you know you want to go to
[80:25] somebody you want to go find somebody
[80:27] who's an expert in that field and then
[80:29] kind of talk to them about this and so I
[80:31] don't know why it doesn't occur it
[80:32] didn't occur I mean well we did premal
[80:34] counseling but like it doesn't occur it
[80:36] didn't occur to me for that reason it
[80:37] just was something that I knew we should
[80:38] do but like it it makes a ton of sense
[80:41] that you would go to somebody who's got
[80:42] you know a healthy marriage um and you
[80:45] could You' ask them questions um I think
[80:47] that's something something else like
[80:49] even even Beyond when you're married
[80:50] just having somebody finding somebody
[80:52] who you can go to as like a mentor or
[80:55] even if it's not some sort of formal
[80:56] mentorship you know relationship um I I
[80:59] think just finding somebody who you can
[81:00] go to and and ask questions of uh
[81:03] because again there's a lot of things
[81:05] that you know I remember just as me
[81:06] being you know married newly married
[81:08] like there's stuff that you're like is
[81:09] this normal is this like you just have
[81:12] no framework for what's normal or not
[81:14] and so I think that having having people
[81:17] again throughout history this has been
[81:18] ideally this had been family like your
[81:20] family you'd go to when you had
[81:21] questions like you go to your dad or
[81:23] you'd go to you know your mom or
[81:24] whatever ask these kind of questions but
[81:25] just more and more we we don't have
[81:27] those that type of closeness with our
[81:29] with our families and so um so yeah so
[81:32] hopefully it could be your family and if
[81:33] not just finding somebody in your life
[81:36] uh you know who you who you look up to
[81:38] in that respect um again the other thing
[81:41] I would mention you mentioned like if
[81:42] you're a younger guy the thing would
[81:44] just be like how are you growing and
[81:46] shaping yourself now in preparing for
[81:49] marriage like who you know like who are
[81:51] you becoming like you're going to
[81:53] attract the type of person that you're
[81:56] becoming right so like the question
[81:57] would be like doing a like an
[81:59] examination or like a what's it called
[82:01] Damn what's the word when you do like a
[82:02] like an examination of yourself like a
[82:05] an accounting like taking account like
[82:07] taking account for your life whatever
[82:09] and like all right if I want to attract
[82:10] a person who's disciplined and who's you
[82:13] know works hard and who's selfless you
[82:15] know like how am I what am I doing to
[82:18] become the type of person that that kind
[82:19] of person would be would be attracted to
[82:21] you know um so I think that would be
[82:23] something else is like just
[82:25] again it's just like anything it's just
[82:26] like you probably Robin starting this
[82:27] podcast right like you start podcasting
[82:30] you probably didn't know a lot about
[82:32] podcasting before you started doing it
[82:33] but you've learned a lot yeah you've
[82:35] learned a lot over over the you know
[82:37] over the days and so you have to you
[82:39] have to fake it until you make it right
[82:40] you have to you're you're going to lar
[82:42] at to a certain point you're gonna
[82:44] you're just gonna be out there trying to
[82:45] do this and so again that's a large part
[82:48] of what it you know what it means to be
[82:49] human and what it means to to you know
[82:52] be somebody who's is going to draw a
[82:53] spouse to you is just like getting out
[82:55] there and you know taking responsibility
[82:58] for things you know taking
[82:59] responsibility for people or you know
[83:01] serving in some sort of capacity like
[83:04] this these are things that signal you
[83:06] know it's where you're going to find
[83:07] other selfless people if you go and
[83:08] volunteer for a charity you know there
[83:10] might be some other girl who's there
[83:12] who's also volunteering and that's the
[83:13] kind of person you want to be you know
[83:15] you want to ideally marry somebody you
[83:17] know be a you know marry somebody who
[83:19] who has that outlook on the world they
[83:21] want to serve the world um and so yeah I
[83:24] think think things like that that you
[83:26] know that might seem obvious to some
[83:27] people that they're I don't think
[83:29] they're necessarily obvious anymore I
[83:30] think there's a lot of people who are
[83:31] just trying to figure out you know they
[83:33] they don't know what to do so I think
[83:35] that those would be a few few
[83:36] recommendations I love that a lot uh
[83:39] just one more question came to my
[83:43] mind keep it
[83:45] going I hope I hope you have stop
[83:47] because we're like we're good okay
[83:49] perfect um how do you look actually at
[83:52] uh the state being so involved in the
[83:54] marriage thing like if it if it gets to
[83:56] a divorce like it's super you said like
[83:59] marrying because of tax reasons is that
[84:01] something Christian it should it should
[84:04] be kind of like more divided right go
[84:07] for not sure if I understand the
[84:08] question your your question is like
[84:09] should you get married for tax advantage
[84:11] per no no like the question is like how
[84:13] do you look at that uh because the
[84:15] marriage is so coincided with the state
[84:18] like it's it's such a state thing you I
[84:22] don't know how it's in America but you
[84:23] actually like go to do the government
[84:25] and you actually sign a contract so it's
[84:29] actually official a partnership in
[84:31] Austria uh so uh there is I I see it
[84:35] sometimes like a a free marriage or how
[84:37] they they call it I don't know the
[84:38] English term of it where they have the
[84:40] marriage and the celebration and
[84:43] everything in the church but just don't
[84:45] go to the state and make it official
[84:47] because they uh intentionally don't want
[84:49] the state to be involved in in in love
[84:52] and then if you if you do something
[84:54] there's lawyers involved and stuff like
[84:56] that like that kind of part of the
[84:58] marriage is really um weird for me that
[85:02] the state and is so involved in in the
[85:06] marriage process this this unnatural for
[85:08] me for some reason yeah again I think
[85:11] this is again it gets back to the same
[85:13] point of like we're we're in this
[85:14] definitional crisis we don't know what
[85:15] things are and again we we're trying to
[85:17] figure out like how do I think about
[85:19] marriage like one of the examples I've
[85:20] given a number of times is like um so
[85:23] for example in in De born Michigan in
[85:25] the United States there it's this city
[85:26] where there are I mean the overwhelming
[85:28] majority of people who live there are
[85:29] Muslims and so because of that like the
[85:32] the society has started to to you know
[85:35] be shaped a certain way so here's an
[85:37] example in the most in the majority of
[85:38] the United States in the US legal system
[85:42] uh generally when it comes to like
[85:43] getting custody of kids like basically
[85:46] in the majority of the cases the mother
[85:48] gets gets priority like the children
[85:50] will go to the mom and that's because of
[85:51] a certain understanding of you know like
[85:54] what children need and and things like
[85:55] this but in in is in Islamic countries
[85:59] it's the complete opposite like when
[86:01] when when if there is a divorce or
[86:02] something like that then then the father
[86:04] gets priority in in uh you know in
[86:07] getting custody and again we can debate
[86:09] about which of these is you know we can
[86:11] debate about the legitimacy of this but
[86:13] both of these things are rooted in in an
[86:16] understanding of of how the world works
[86:18] and what's best for all parties involved
[86:20] and so the question is like what do you
[86:21] do when you have different conceptions
[86:23] within a single country um and so this
[86:25] is this is something that's being you
[86:27] know worked out in court cases you know
[86:29] Inc in this you know in this area of
[86:31] Michigan where you have this you know
[86:32] huge population of of Islam uh of of
[86:35] Muslims and so to a similar degree I
[86:38] think like when it comes to this
[86:39] question of marriage and like the
[86:40] state's involvement in it yeah like
[86:42] again if you look at if you look at like
[86:44] what what marriage is obviously this it
[86:47] has implications on the state but like
[86:49] within Christianity like it it's not a
[86:51] government that creates it's not a human
[86:54] government that creates a marriage uh
[86:56] and this again goes back to within
[86:58] within Christianity goes back to you
[87:00] know the Garden of Eden God brings man
[87:02] and woman together and so you know
[87:04] within the Christian tradition what God
[87:05] has we say this in in most marriages
[87:07] like what God has joined together let no
[87:09] man separate and so basically the you
[87:12] know it in in the United States
[87:14] basically the the the civil government
[87:17] um like recognizes a marriage but the
[87:20] marriage is is is basically performed
[87:23] it's God creating a marriage um so again
[87:25] if if my if my fiance and I were on a if
[87:29] we're on a deserted island we go out we
[87:31] go out on a on a trip together we end up
[87:33] on a deserted island and uh there's no
[87:36] other human around can we be married and
[87:40] the answer is yeah like we totally could
[87:42] because like God makes marriage and so
[87:44] we can commit to each other that you
[87:45] know and so we're married in the eyes of
[87:47] God even if there's nobody else around
[87:49] but in the situation where there are
[87:51] other people where there are governments
[87:53] around then then you know signing some
[87:54] sort of certificate where uh you know
[87:57] where the government basically says all
[87:58] right we recognize this like that's
[88:00] perfectly legitimate now what we saw in
[88:02] urqu when we were there is that people
[88:05] many people don't get married in a
[88:06] church at all like they'll just go down
[88:07] to the courthouse and they act and
[88:09] basically that's the only thing that
[88:11] determines whether or not you're married
[88:13] is you know if the if the civil
[88:15] government says that you are and so
[88:17] again that for from again from a
[88:19] Christian perspective that that's not a
[88:21] true accounting of what's actually going
[88:22] on in marriage um but given the the
[88:25] secular you know worldview of of you
[88:28] know the the Uruguayan government right
[88:30] now like I understand why they do it
[88:32] that way um but yeah that it's it's a
[88:34] great question it's a great question I
[88:36] think a lot of people are going to be
[88:37] you know asking more and more over the
[88:38] next you know few few years well I I
[88:41] think like what you're saying is
[88:42] important uh Jordan just because you
[88:44] want to get back to those original
[88:45] definitions and so for for most
[88:47] Christians we we trace the original
[88:48] marriage back to Genesis chapter 2 at
[88:51] the very beginning of the Bible or the
[88:53] second chapter of the Bible where uh God
[88:55] creates humans and he creates uh man
[88:58] first he creates Adam and then he
[89:00] creates Eve out of a out of a ribbon his
[89:02] side and brings Eve to Adam and Adam's
[89:06] just thrilled right so he just busts
[89:07] into song and starts saying oh this is
[89:09] bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and uh
[89:12] she shall be called wom because she was
[89:13] formed out of man and then it says this
[89:15] it says uh it says for this reason a man
[89:17] shall leave his father and mother and be
[89:20] joined to his wife and the two shall
[89:21] become one flesh and so this is like a
[89:24] biblical precedent for marriage that
[89:26] existed long before any form of
[89:28] government existed this is before there
[89:30] was even other people to witness it it
[89:31] was just like God Adam and Eve and he
[89:34] performed the first marriage and brought
[89:35] them together and so yeah I just Echo
[89:38] what you're saying like I you can you
[89:39] can go to the courthouse you can get
[89:41] married but ultimately it's it's that
[89:43] commitment to to to be one flesh
[89:45] together to come together as as husband
[89:48] and wife that that seals you before the
[89:50] eyes of God and I I'm actually I'm very
[89:52] thankful that there are taxes advantages
[89:54] I will say uh to that and and that we
[89:57] live in a society that recognizes uh
[89:59] marriage because it is is kind of just
[90:01] it's just nice to not have to go around
[90:02] explain to everyone oh yeah so this is
[90:04] this a person that's very close to me
[90:06] like kind of like a friend but like
[90:07] closer because we live together and we
[90:09] have children together like you don't
[90:10] have to explain all that because
[90:11] everyone just knows what marriage is and
[90:14] and so you can just you can run with it
[90:16] uh so I'm yeah I'm thankful that the
[90:17] government Institute is is honoring of
[90:20] the institution I I should say yeah
[90:23] definitely
[90:24] it's it makes it uh easier I just asked
[90:27] the question because a lot of bitcoiners
[90:29] are very critical of of the government
[90:31] so I think like it's an interesting
[90:33] thing yeah and I think again this is
[90:36] this is part of the thing we get into a
[90:37] lot right is like my my criticism of
[90:40] government and in a lot of Libertarians
[90:41] like they they come across as
[90:43] anti-government right they come AC it's
[90:45] like I want to get rid of government
[90:47] it's like no you don't really what you
[90:49] want to do is you want to get R
[90:51] basically the government is today is
[90:52] like a morbidly obese man okay it's a
[90:55] morbidly obese man where there's actual
[90:57] like if you did an x-ray there's a much
[90:59] smaller
[91:01] manide you can see like the bone like
[91:03] the the bone structure this this man was
[91:05] never designed to be as big as he is he
[91:07] was supposed to be far more far smaller
[91:09] and that that that him being smaller
[91:11] would actually allow him to serve those
[91:13] around him much better than he's able to
[91:15] serve them in his current capacity as a
[91:16] morbidly obese person and so I think
[91:18] that this is actually a really helpful
[91:21] understanding of government like
[91:22] government you know was created to to
[91:24] serve certain
[91:25] functions and right now it's taken on
[91:28] far more than that and become far more
[91:30] useless because it it's it's too big to
[91:33] actually you know to to serve a lot of
[91:35] the things that it was designed to do
[91:36] and so uh but again this is this is one
[91:38] of the things where you somebody could
[91:40] easily say back to me well well how do
[91:41] you know that what government's supposed
[91:42] to do and I would say exactly this is
[91:45] like everyone has an A has a standard
[91:48] that they appeal to to try to Define
[91:50] anything in in life uh and the question
[91:53] is you know do we acknowledge those
[91:54] standards or not if it if it's some if
[91:56] it's something as simple as well the
[91:58] government says so well the government
[92:00] has said you know governments have said
[92:01] lots of awful things throughout time
[92:03] that people realize wait I I I shouldn't
[92:06] listen to this you know the government
[92:07] wants me to turn in my neighbors you
[92:09] know like this you know for for any one
[92:11] of a number of reasons um should should
[92:13] I do that or not and so again it can't
[92:15] just be something as simple as if a law
[92:18] is passed saying that this should be
[92:20] should be true then it then we have to
[92:22] obey it it's not that simple
[92:24] but then defining outside of that having
[92:26] a basis by which to define those things
[92:28] is is difficult right you got to that's
[92:31] when things don't you're not able to
[92:32] keep them as as uh you know neat and and
[92:35] secular and you know clean as as we
[92:37] might like that's amazing um wow uh I
[92:42] have an I will just make a hard cut here
[92:44] we have we have an endro in the podcast
[92:47] where the previous guest is asking a
[92:49] question for the next guest without
[92:50] knowing who the next guest actually is
[92:52] and uh it's an interesting one it's a
[92:54] family uh question also but a different
[92:56] one um if you could give your Bitcoin uh
[93:01] if you couldn't give your Bitcoin to
[93:03] your family when you die who would you
[93:05] give it to that's a great question my
[93:07] family I I'd probably I'd probably
[93:09] donate it to um to my Ministry or to uh
[93:12] or to my church assuming they had
[93:16] instructions on like how to take care of
[93:17] it
[93:18] properly because they wouldn't right now
[93:21] yeah it'd be the same same answer um you
[93:24] know my probably my church if I if I
[93:26] couldn't give it to somebody who was
[93:26] related to it' probably be again a
[93:28] church or another or another Ministry
[93:30] you should first have to orange pill
[93:32] them so they can handle the Bitcoins
[93:34] crazy story in my case my pastors owned
[93:37] Bitcoin before I did so like our oh wow
[93:39] nice our pastors yeah they've been
[93:41] bitcoiners since I think 2016 or
[93:44] 2017 so wow that's amazing yeah thank
