[00:00] it's an ego test challenging people to
[00:02] uh question their Basics Bitcoin forces
[00:05] you to challenge what is money in the
[00:06] first place Larry think is a great
[00:08] example who was completely against it
[00:10] until the moment where he actually
[00:12] questioned it Bitcoin has clearly become
[00:14] a completely different instrument in
[00:15] 20124 than what it was in 2023
[00:18] especially when you look at it from a
[00:19] risk return perspective I think that we
[00:21] are really entering a new era for
[00:23] Bitcoin where prices will be face
[00:26] melting because the interest will come
[00:28] from all sides while the Supply
[00:30] obviously is strictly kept if you had
[00:32] bought the house with Bitcoin that would
[00:34] have cost you 664 Bitcoin while today
[00:37] buying the average house is costing you
[00:39] about six Bitcoin so your purchasing
[00:41] power was multiplied by a factor of 100
[00:44] if you had held Bitcoin rather than Fiat
[00:46] currencies put together all the
[00:48] processing power of Apple Amazon
[00:50] Facebook Microsoft together and use them
[00:53] exclusively to attack the Bitcoin
[00:55] Network they would still not even make
[00:57] 1% of the processing power on the
[00:59] Bitcoin Network if China with all of its
[01:01] efforts and its almost endless resources
[01:03] is completely unable to even threaten
[01:05] Bitcoin Network I don't think that any
[01:07] other country in the world would manage
[01:09] to do anything to it the only thing you
[01:11] can do is Ban yourself from profiting
[01:13] from Bitcoin so it is not something that
[01:15] can be corrupted it is not something
[01:17] that can be used for political ends it
[01:19] is a genuinely neutral
[01:22] [Music]
[01:26] commodity coming from the traditional
[01:28] financial industry
[01:30] you are you know trained to think in a
[01:33] certain way and uh being let's say a
[01:37] square peg into a wrong hole is uh does
[01:40] not fit usually but um for those who are
[01:44] open-minded enough they look into
[01:45] Bitcoin very seriously like I did and
[01:48] then uh they decide to make completely
[01:49] the switch like I did
[01:52] absolutely interesting yeah then let's
[01:54] get started directly with with with that
[01:56] I would say um uh it's it's interesting
[01:59] for me when when when we look at uh the
[02:01] the topic of like traditional financing
[02:03] coming into Bitcoin um like why do you
[02:07] think there are so so so less people so
[02:11] not not a lot of people that actually
[02:13] come from traditional Financial space
[02:15] and then like yeah it's let's let's see
[02:16] that Bitcoin thing it seems like they
[02:18] they learn too much of fear and then
[02:21] have a hard uh time to actually switch
[02:24] over to the Bitcoin how was that for you
[02:27] yeah actually you know it starts with
[02:29] what you study in typical economics or
[02:31] Finance uh uh universities or you know
[02:35] studies where you never are presented to
[02:39] the idea that money is something it's a
[02:43] it's an agreement between people you
[02:46] know um you you have countless classes
[02:50] on what do I know accounting uh
[02:52] microeconomics and so on but they never
[02:54] investigate the very Basics what is
[02:57] money and uh and since you have never
[03:00] done that for your entire you know
[03:02] studies and then in your career in
[03:03] banking or other Financial Services
[03:06] questioning these Basics is often
[03:08] challenging and uh Bitcoin requires the
[03:14] let's say the it's an ego test
[03:17] challenging people to uh question their
[03:19] Basics what if the entire Baseline layer
[03:24] on which we are working on which we are
[03:26] basing all of our assumptions is just
[03:28] the wrong one and uh Bitcoin kind of
[03:31] forces you to challenge what is money in
[03:33] the first place and then once you are
[03:36] open enough to to challenge that then
[03:37] you come into the the rapid hole and
[03:40] then you can be converted to bitcoin and
[03:42] unfortunately I think a lot of people in
[03:44] the traditional Financial system do not
[03:46] make uh that switch are not open-minded
[03:49] enough to challenge their assumptions
[03:51] and uh and therefore they end up
[03:53] dismissing Bitcoin like most uh
[03:57] financial advisers do you know just
[04:00] Larry think is is a great example who
[04:02] was completely against it until the
[04:04] moment where he actually questioned it
[04:06] and then now he's one of the big
[04:09] Advocate uh behind
[04:10] Bitcoin what do you think uh made May
[04:14] switched his mind like what like a guy
[04:17] that Larry think doesn't need Bitcoin I
[04:19] think everyone knows that uh he's
[04:22] financially well off and he absolutely
[04:25] could ignore like a war Buffett like
[04:28] Bill Gates like so many other people say
[04:30] like a Bitcoin is is is red poison I
[04:33] don't need that he he could be that guy
[04:35] like why did he saw uh Bitcoin do you
[04:38] know
[04:40] that well the optimistic view is to say
[04:44] that uh he probably was humble enough to
[04:49] challenge the base assumption on which
[04:51] he has built his Empire at Black Rock
[04:53] now the not so optimistic view is that
[04:55] he just thought okay there is money to
[04:56] be made and then he just tried to find
[04:58] the way to make money and then while
[05:00] doing that he understood that actually
[05:02] there's really something behind it um
[05:05] the truth is probably somewhere in
[05:06] between the two um but yeah I mean for
[05:11] for all the other big Financial Titans
[05:13] to to be able to embrace Bitcoin you
[05:16] need you need them to to have a little
[05:18] bit more humility and admit that they do
[05:21] not know it all which unfortunately is a
[05:24] challenge for a lot of people and I want
[05:25] to say especially in the finance
[05:28] world yeah it's it's uh the the ego
[05:32] death uh it's it's not it's not easy for
[05:35] for traditional Finance guys at least in
[05:38] in my experience uh it's it's kind of
[05:41] hard to do um it's it's interesting um
[05:43] let's look a little bit at at the year
[05:46] uh before we get started with with other
[05:48] topics um this year has been a special
[05:52] one I feel like uh I mean for me
[05:54] personally because I started the podcast
[05:55] and stuff like that but in in general
[05:57] for Bitcoin uh there have has been so
[06:00] much happening from like the Bitcoin ETF
[06:03] from the Haring from Trump being a
[06:06] supporter all of the sudden for Bitcoin
[06:08] from all of the sudden there is a bill
[06:11] that calls in America Bitcoin as a
[06:13] strategic Reserve that has now a fair
[06:15] chance of actually passing uh so like
[06:18] what what do you make out of all that
[06:20] year like what what's what's your kind
[06:22] of takeaway of all that um things that
[06:26] already happened and what do you kind of
[06:29] expect from that Bitcoin is clearly has
[06:31] clearly become a completely different
[06:33] instrument in 2024 than what it was in
[06:36] 2023 especially when you look at it from
[06:38] a risk return perspective you know
[06:40] before
[06:42] 2024 you didn't have the Larry think uh
[06:46] supporting it you didn't have you know
[06:48] Trump even remotely on the radar of
[06:50] being elected um you didn't have the ETF
[06:54] in place uh and other items you
[06:57] mentioned
[06:59] um therefore there was still quite some
[07:01] risk now um the risk that you know it's
[07:05] completely dismissed by big let's say
[07:08] financial institution by politicians is
[07:11] very low because you have all these
[07:14] institutions that have embraced it that
[07:15] stand behind it you have uh literally
[07:18] the full Trump Administration that is
[07:20] behind it I mean from from musk to
[07:23] Kennedy to VI kamaswami you know they
[07:26] are all people who genuinely understand
[07:28] what Bitcoin is and uh them speaking at
[07:32] the Bitcoin conference in 24 and in 23
[07:36] already proves that they have interest
[07:38] for it and then if you actually listen
[07:40] to the speech they made um they
[07:42] genuinely understand what uh Bitcoin is
[07:45] what kind of benefits it can bring to
[07:47] the world so if I look at Bitcoin over
[07:50] its history you really have different
[07:52] phases you know it's started with
[07:55] something that is really for nerds
[07:57] something extremely weak and not well
[07:59] decentralized at first but fortunately
[08:03] it uh evolved into something stronger
[08:05] and stronger it
[08:07] improved um but it was still a extremely
[08:10] risky uh
[08:12] thing um until at least the block size
[08:15] Wars in what was it 2017 2018 because
[08:19] until that point bit it wasn't clear
[08:22] even to bitcoiners what Bitcoin really
[08:23] was you know is it a currency is it a
[08:26] store of value is it something different
[08:29] and
[08:31] um I think that there was this first
[08:33] break uh so uh breakup point in uh with
[08:37] the block siiz war when after that
[08:39] period bit Bitcoin became something much
[08:42] more understood something much more
[08:44] accepted and the uh risk that Bitcoin
[08:47] would die dropped to uh an extremely low
[08:51] level from that point onwards it needed
[08:54] uh it needed to have institutional
[08:56] acceptance political acceptance and to
[08:59] to have some kind of regulator framework
[09:01] around it to decrease legal risk and um
[09:05] and Regulatory risk and these elements
[09:08] are clearly what happened in 2024 so we
[09:12] were over the last six years or so in
[09:14] this transitory period And I think now
[09:16] with let's say 2025 starting with the
[09:19] new uh US Presidency I think that we are
[09:22] really entering a new era for Bitcoin
[09:25] where uh prices will be face melting as
[09:28] they like to say in the industry because
[09:30] uh the interest will uh will come from
[09:33] all sides while the supply obviously is
[09:37] uh strictly capped so there isn't enough
[09:42] um chairs to sit on but a lot of people
[09:44] who will want to to sit on that
[09:47] asset what what is uh what is face
[09:50] melting prices like what what what does
[09:52] qualify face
[09:54] melting
[09:57] well I'm trying to hold myself from
[09:59] making any uh concrete predictions
[10:02] because uh the only thing you know with
[10:04] a prediction is that it can only be
[10:06] wrong
[10:08] um and in the case of uh Bitcoin in
[10:11] particular I noticed that with trying to
[10:14] Value Bitcoin for the future if you at
[10:17] least manage to be in the right order of
[10:19] magnitude then you're already extremely
[10:21] accurate so saying that uh next year
[10:24] Bitcoin would be let's say below 100K or
[10:26] between 100K and a million or above a
[10:28] million if you man to be in one of the
[10:30] three range I mean in the one that is
[10:32] right that's already extremely accurate
[10:34] predictions and um I think it would be
[10:37] rather the lther uh of uh of the two um
[10:42] so the the lther two of of the three
[10:44] that I mentioned now whether we will end
[10:47] the the the year 2025 with what do I
[10:51] know 200k or 600k or already go beyond
[10:55] the million it's impossible to say so
[10:57] timeing is difficult plenty of things
[10:58] can happen
[10:59] but one thing one thing is just next to
[11:02] certain is that the way forward is up up
[11:06] up absolutely that's you you only have
[11:09] to be directional
[11:11] correct as long as you don't do any
[11:14] crazy leverage things which I never
[11:15] recommend doing and always say like
[11:18] stick to the basics of hodling uh but
[11:20] yeah it's it's uh it's it's exciting
[11:23] times ahead that that that's that's
[11:25] really cool and I also think face
[11:28] melting uh uh I think uh in the next
[11:32] year it will be face melting for outside
[11:35] of bitcoiners like like normies who are
[11:38] not that into Bitcoin but then the
[11:40] coming years probably will be even face
[11:42] meding for bitcoiners and they they will
[11:45] be surprised on on how far Bitcoin
[11:47] actually can go not only from a priz
[11:49] like actually like from who does adopt
[11:51] it and what's happening as in events
[11:54] like we I think we have no clue what's
[11:56] really going on the next years when you
[11:58] just look at like the the first 11
[12:00] months what happened in in in 2024 it's
[12:03] it's quite fascinating how far we have
[12:04] come in just like this 11 months uh
[12:07] makes you wonder what what what can
[12:09] happen of of that and uh I think you
[12:12] mentioned it already or maybe not you
[12:14] also the the CFO of of relay so there's
[12:18] one thing this podcast will come out in
[12:21] two weeks time so this will come out in
[12:23] like uh end of November uh so we are
[12:27] close now when when this people actually
[12:29] see to the date when Microsoft uh is
[12:33] actually deciding on like buying Bitcoin
[12:35] or not uh what do you think uh as you
[12:38] have as you are the CFO of a company uh
[12:43] completely different Scale Company than
[12:45] Microsoft uh but still you you probably
[12:47] have way more um uh Insight of like how
[12:51] that decision making actually uh occurs
[12:54] and and How likely it might be obviously
[12:57] nobody knows because it's a shareholder
[12:59] but how do you look at Microsoft and
[13:02] then maybe potentially other companies
[13:04] spying
[13:05] that I obviously hope that they will
[13:08] vote uh in favor of Bitcoin but uh yeah
[13:12] I have my prediction would be that they
[13:14] won't I mean this is this is a company
[13:17] for Boomers this is a company that you
[13:20] know it was great 20 years ago and uh it
[13:23] is let's say it is not on the top of
[13:26] Technology uh right now um and I think
[13:30] that they're I do not know their cap
[13:31] table let me be honest however my
[13:34] assumption is that it will be mostly a
[13:36] company that was bought by people who uh
[13:41] who were from the previous generation uh
[13:44] not ours and who are probably not that
[13:46] attuned on average uh to bitcoin and to
[13:50] the the potential of Bitcoin uh to
[13:53] change the world therefore I assume most
[13:55] of them will just think oh it's a joke
[13:58] it's not serious
[13:59] just because they are you know 10 years
[14:01] late on uh on the reality of what's
[14:04] Happening um so Microsoft is probably
[14:07] not they are not the ones who will lead
[14:09] the way uh those who will lead the way
[14:11] in my opinion are much smaller uh
[14:14] companies of course you will have some
[14:16] that that are fairly big you know the
[14:20] the micro strategy and uh and some that
[14:23] are adding Bitcoin to their uh balance
[14:25] sheet however I think that smmes are the
[14:28] one who will uh start the phase and I
[14:29] think it's a great way to see it's a
[14:32] great thing to see because the smaller
[14:35] guys who are open-minded enough to uh to
[14:40] understand how the new Financial system
[14:42] will look like they are the ones who
[14:43] will benefit from uh from the next wave
[14:46] of price increase and the future benefit
[14:48] that Bitcoin will
[14:49] bring absolutely yeah my my only hope is
[14:52] uh that black rock has some influence
[14:55] because I think they have like seven or
[14:57] eight% of the company something like
[14:59] that uh so that's my only hope that
[15:03] Microsoft maybe um gets sold on bitcoin
[15:07] by those guys and they're like hey buy
[15:10] Bitcoin and by the way you can use our
[15:12] black
[15:13] c as an instrument for that so maybe
[15:15] maybe there's some um motivated uh Black
[15:19] Rock say people there making some
[15:22] interference but as you said uh the
[15:24] shareholder base who hold the um vot
[15:29] rides probably are not skewed towards
[15:32] those those people who would vote for
[15:34] Bitcoin but yeah maybe maybe let's see
[15:37] it will be fun to to watch I
[15:40] guess
[15:42] absolutely absolutely perfect then uh
[15:45] let's let's go um a little bit back to
[15:47] the Strategic Reserve um as we are both
[15:51] uh in in in Europe I think you're also
[15:54] um uh residing in in Europe right yes
[15:57] I'm actually in Vienna here in Austria
[15:59] oh you're in Vienna also wow really cool
[16:02] we're in the same same city even uh
[16:04] perfect didn't knew that um and it's
[16:08] it's interesting for me when we in
[16:09] Europe and there's all the the big news
[16:12] is always coming from America it seems
[16:14] like the Strategic Reserve uh I mean
[16:17] obviously the ETF we we have since 2015
[16:19] and ETP so like that we have that way
[16:23] earlier than that how do you look at uh
[16:25] nation state game theory how do you look
[16:27] at the difference of like um where
[16:30] America already is and might be in in
[16:34] the future even further ahead uh and
[16:36] Europe is still kind of
[16:39] um I I don't want to say hostile but
[16:43] skeptical uh from a regulation
[16:45] standpoint towards it I didn't hear any
[16:49] European country saying hey we might
[16:50] adopt it as a strategic Reserve asset uh
[16:53] so like how do you look at that game
[16:54] theory in
[16:56] Europe um to get there I would like to
[17:00] First have a look a little bit at what's
[17:01] happening in the US you know there is
[17:03] for example this um Foundation the
[17:06] satosi action fund who is promoting uh
[17:09] you know the Ino so um sharing knowledge
[17:13] about Bitcoin especially with States and
[17:16] then ultimately uh hopefully at Federal
[17:18] level and as uh people from that
[17:21] Foundation are often seeing it starts
[17:23] with state adoption before is getting to
[17:26] a federal level this is also what CIA
[17:28] Lum is uh was pushing uh I think it's
[17:31] she cator for Wyoming if I'm not
[17:33] mistaken um so she started you know at a
[17:36] more local level and now pushing that
[17:39] idea to uh towards higher level of the
[17:42] the federal scale now in Europe I
[17:46] believe something similar might happen
[17:49] that you will have more and more
[17:50] adoption among people among smmes among
[17:54] institutions and ultimately you will
[17:57] have bitcoiners that will infiltrate uh
[18:00] governments or political parties and
[18:02] that will uh share the Merit of Bitcoin
[18:05] why it would be the best thing to do uh
[18:09] at any level um at any level of uh of
[18:13] government and this is already what we
[18:15] are seeing at some places um you know in
[18:18] Germany um there are some people that
[18:22] are you know now talking about Bitcoin
[18:24] at uh the level of the uh bundes heart
[18:27] and uh the car promoting uh usage of
[18:30] Bitcoin now clearly we are very far away
[18:34] from having any government in Europe
[18:37] having a pro Bitcoin stance but I think
[18:40] it's uh it will come eventually it will
[18:43] just take many more years than in the US
[18:46] now will that be two years or five years
[18:48] or 10 years impossible to say but um I
[18:53] think that it unfortunately Europe will
[18:55] stay on the sideline and uh miss a big
[18:59] part of uh this wave the same way Europe
[19:02] you know Europe is not leading in
[19:04] Innovation Europe is leading leading in
[19:06] regulation which um is still unclear to
[19:09] me what is is bringing uh to the people
[19:12] to have such an anti- innovation stance
[19:15] uh at the end of the day but I think
[19:17] that um that the Bitcoin Innovation is
[19:21] will be the same they will not be
[19:23] leading they will try to be quick
[19:25] followers and they will end up being uh
[19:27] late followers they will get there
[19:29] eventually just not not as part of the
[19:33] leaders yeah the the the Masters in in
[19:36] regulations there's this popular saying
[19:38] of like America innovates China copies
[19:41] and uh Europe
[19:45] regulates it's super interesting uh to
[19:49] see uh I mean I I have a lot of Hope
[19:52] always I'm always a really optimistic
[19:55] person uh but I just don't see anything
[19:58] from a political level I mean there's
[20:00] the German uh one uh but it's an
[20:02] initiative of uh one um Parliament
[20:07] member of Joanna kotar she will also be
[20:09] uh soon be on on my podcast uh that's
[20:13] great that things are moving and I know
[20:15] Al in Austria the um the the the parties
[20:21] are aware of it they are meeting with uh
[20:26] for example uh people in the in the
[20:29] Bitcoin space so there are things
[20:31] happening
[20:33] but I feel like they should be further
[20:36] ahead already they should already have
[20:38] been happening like three four years ago
[20:40] and now we are already further but maybe
[20:42] that's just like visual thinking of of a
[20:45] of a Bitcoin here um you also which is
[20:49] super interesting for me uh that you
[20:51] come from the this traditional uh space
[20:53] of Finance uh and you have this FM uh
[20:57] that you have next to your name this uh
[20:59] Financial Risk Management as you said it
[21:02] um and I just talked a few hours ago
[21:06] with someone about the risks of Bitcoin
[21:09] which is an super interesting topic
[21:11] because there's like the crowd is like
[21:12] ah Bitcoin has no risk Bitcoin is is
[21:14] like risk- free and then you have the
[21:17] traditional folks see like know like
[21:19] Bitcoin is the most risk on asset ever
[21:22] blackr even said like Bitcoin is a risk
[21:24] off asset which was quite surprising how
[21:27] do you act assess uh and describe the
[21:31] the risks of holding Bitcoin and the
[21:34] risks of of Bitcoin itself okay like for
[21:37] most things in life the uh reality is a
[21:40] bit uh it's a bit complex in the sense
[21:43] that risk must be differentiated there
[21:45] are multiple types of risk and
[21:47] unfortunately the traditional financial
[21:49] industry has adopted a definition for
[21:51] risk that I think is uh very misleading
[21:54] So In traditional Finance when you talk
[21:56] about a risky asset what they mean is a
[21:59] volatile asset so risk is the standard
[22:02] deviation of the expected return um so
[22:05] basically how volatile it is and with
[22:08] that definition Bitcoin is clearly
[22:11] highly volatile and therefore what they
[22:13] call a risky asset now um therefore by
[22:18] kind of by definition the so taking zero
[22:22] risk with that definition would be to
[22:23] hold dollars but look at the value of
[22:25] the dollars 30 years ago um um you know
[22:29] $1 was still $1 however it could buy you
[22:33] more than twice what you can buy today
[22:35] with a dollar so while there is no
[22:38] volatility I mean the only certainty is
[22:41] that you are losing purchasing power
[22:43] every day by holding uh these
[22:45] traditional Fiat currencies now holding
[22:48] stocks um you know brings you a bit more
[22:52] volatility but at least you are kind of
[22:54] maintaining your purchasing power over
[22:56] time now with Bitcoin
[22:58] you have even more volatility but your
[23:01] purchasing power clearly increases over
[23:03] time it was anony Pano I think uh last
[23:07] week who was for example making a
[23:08] comparison of how much it cost to buy a
[23:12] house you know in 2016 compared to today
[23:15] in dollars or in um in Euros so in 2016
[23:19] if you were to buy a house it would have
[23:21] cost you on average
[23:23] $280,000 while today it cost you on
[23:25] average $400,000 so it increased by 50%
[23:29] now at the time if you had bought the
[23:32] house with Bitcoin that would have cost
[23:34] you 664 Bitcoin while today buying the
[23:37] average house is costing you about six
[23:39] Bitcoin so your purchasing power was
[23:42] multiplied by a factor of 100 uh if you
[23:45] had held Bitcoin rather than uh Fiat
[23:48] currencies or uh or house in that
[23:52] example um so the risk that people are
[23:57] mentioning based on volatility is I
[23:59] think a very misleading metric so what
[24:03] you need to consider
[24:05] is what is appropriate for you in terms
[24:09] of um your investment Horizon what is uh
[24:14] appropriate in terms of your ability to
[24:15] Bear volatility over a short period of
[24:18] time you know if you really don't have
[24:20] any money uh let's say very little money
[24:23] and you will need to have a big expense
[24:25] in I don't know three months do you put
[24:28] everything you own into Bitcoin well
[24:30] that's probably not what I would
[24:32] recommend because you know nobody knows
[24:35] whether in three months it will be uh
[24:37] 50% higher or 20% lower uh it can very
[24:41] much uh be that if you will need to sell
[24:45] your Bitcoin in three months you will be
[24:46] at a loss however I'm considering you
[24:49] know I'm saving Bitcoin so that my son
[24:51] can buy a house when he is my age well
[24:55] over that Horizon will it be 20% lower
[24:58] no the value will be very largely
[25:00] Superior this is uh like just NE to
[25:04] certain uh when you understand the the
[25:06] basics behind Bitcoin and the incentives
[25:08] behind it and in my eyes therefore
[25:12] saving into Bitcoin is precisely you
[25:14] know removing the risk I want to
[25:16] maintain the value of my wealth over a
[25:18] long period of time this is precisely
[25:20] removing the risk now to people from the
[25:25] traditional financial industry that are
[25:27] looking at risk
[25:29] you do not look at risk alone you don't
[25:30] not just look at volatility typically
[25:32] you combine it with uh return and you
[25:35] know you need to make sure that the
[25:37] expected return of what you invest in is
[25:39] worth more than the uh incremental risk
[25:42] that you are taking on and fortunately
[25:45] there are multiple metrics in order to
[25:48] make uh this comparison the most famous
[25:50] one is probably the sharp ratio so named
[25:52] after William sharp a Nobel Prize
[25:55] of uh what was it 60 years ago or
[25:57] something
[25:58] um where the sharp ratio basically
[26:02] establishes how much additional return
[26:05] you gain um by making investment
[26:08] compared to the additional risk you're
[26:10] taking so you have a benchmark let's say
[26:12] US Treasury which is typically used as
[26:14] Benchmark the additional return of
[26:17] investing in a stock may be let's say an
[26:19] additional 5% if the additional
[26:22] volatility is an additional I don't know
[26:24] like 2% you take the ratio of the two
[26:26] and therefore you can
[26:28] compare Securities or compare
[26:31] Investments that have different risk
[26:33] profiles it's not just saying one has a
[26:35] higher return or one has a lower risk
[26:38] you know it's saying compared to its
[26:40] risk this uh this investment is more
[26:45] worth it or it's more you know the risk
[26:47] adjusted return is bigger than uh that
[26:51] of this alternative investment now if
[26:54] you look at Bitcoin from that
[26:56] perspective and almost regardless of
[26:59] which time Horizon you take if it's more
[27:01] than let's say five years so whether
[27:03] whether you take five years or eight
[27:04] years or 10 years the risk adjusted
[27:06] return of Bitcoin is largely superior to
[27:10] the risk adjusted return of basically
[27:12] any uh uh security or index clearly
[27:17] largely Superior to Gold S&P 500 even
[27:20] the NASDAQ or um or any other commodity
[27:24] you can imagine I partnered up with coin
[27:28] with digante this is the most beautiful
[27:30] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[27:33] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[27:36] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[27:39] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[27:42] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[27:45] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[27:47] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[27:51] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[27:54] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[27:57] watch collection you have the date of
[27:59] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[28:03] there and of course also the block
[28:05] height and which EPO we are currently in
[28:08] I love the level of detail they put in
[28:11] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[28:13] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[28:16] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[28:19] love those watches so so much if you
[28:22] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[28:24] regular basis I'll guess you already
[28:26] bought some Bitcoin coin and now the
[28:29] most important step is to keep the
[28:32] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[28:34] wallet my personal recommendation for
[28:36] hard wallet is the bit box it's super
[28:39] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[28:41] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[28:43] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[28:46] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[28:50] the checkout visit bitbox Swiss robobin
[28:54] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[28:57] to really let up your sovereignty as an
[29:00] individual you have to have the most
[29:02] secure self- custody setup you have to
[29:05] secure your own devices you have to
[29:07] protect your privacy you have to set up
[29:10] an inheritance plan and depending on
[29:13] where you live you even want to have a
[29:15] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[29:18] in case something goes really really
[29:20] wrong and through all those steps the
[29:22] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[29:25] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[29:27] way.com /p Partners robobin you even get
[29:31] a 30 minute free call to find out how
[29:34] you can level up your
[29:38] sovereignty that that makes a lot of
[29:40] sense uh when you look at like the the
[29:42] volatility and then the the risk
[29:45] associated that with with the
[29:47] Investments um and now there is also a
[29:50] different kind of a risk of like what is
[29:53] the risk of Bitcoin being hurt like
[29:56] fundamental like the asset and the
[29:58] network um is is there something because
[30:04] uh when we are in the Bitcoin bubble if
[30:07] podcasting and Twitter and stuff like
[30:09] that um we often forget that uh people
[30:13] that are coming new to the Bitcoin space
[30:15] and I see that now a little bit more and
[30:17] more where people have actually ask me
[30:19] okay hey how is the Bitcoin thing going
[30:22] like it got a little bit more in the
[30:24] last like three weeks I would say um
[30:28] people actually have those questions
[30:30] like oh can Bitcoin be banned or like uh
[30:33] what happens if there's like a bug or
[30:35] something like that uh how do you look
[30:37] at that risk from uh from your
[30:40] perspective is is that something that is
[30:42] like okay it's such a low probability
[30:45] and it's it's so far out the curve it's
[30:47] it's kind of hard to look at that or how
[30:49] do you assess
[30:50] that um so I wrote a book on bitcoin uh
[30:53] that was published last summer and I
[30:55] have actually two chapters dedicated to
[30:57] risk management to run Bitcoin so one on
[30:59] Financial Risk covering some of the
[31:01] topics I've discussed and one fully
[31:03] focusing on non-financial risks and
[31:05] those are precisely the one you
[31:06] mentioned so there are multiple types of
[31:10] non-financial risks that um let's say
[31:13] people talk a lot about but that
[31:16] actually when you look into them are
[31:18] completely irrelevant the common ones
[31:20] are for example uh what is the risk that
[31:24] uh you know a 51% attack so basically
[31:27] that one one big entity with enormous
[31:31] mining power so let's say um computer uh
[31:34] processor so many uh computer processing
[31:37] power could take over the network and
[31:39] mine blocks faster than the rest of the
[31:41] network so that's one of the topics you
[31:45] you hear a lot um and people completely
[31:49] underestimate the level of security of
[31:52] the Bitcoin
[31:54] Network in order for any entity to take
[31:58] over 50% plus of the network you would
[32:01] need to have such a mindblowing quantity
[32:04] of energy that you know that entity
[32:06] would basically control the World by far
[32:08] if that was possible and to put things
[32:10] in perspective if you could put together
[32:13] all the processing power of Apple Amazon
[32:17] Facebook Microsoft
[32:19] together um and use them exclusively to
[32:24] attack the Bitcoin Network well they
[32:26] would still not even make one % of the
[32:30] uh of the processing power on the
[32:31] Bitcoin Network so even all of these big
[32:34] institutions would come nowhere near the
[32:37] ability of uh of threatening uh the
[32:41] Bitcoin Security in addition to the fact
[32:43] that it's actually definitely not in
[32:45] their incentive to uh to spend billions
[32:48] of dollar to just temporarily be able to
[32:51] uh to mine blocks a bit faster than the
[32:53] rest of the network which at the end of
[32:55] the day will not bring them anything
[32:58] maybe they would they would mind a few
[32:59] blocks but that's uh that's peut
[33:01] compared to um the value of the network
[33:04] so not only is it technically impossible
[33:07] but on top you have game theoretical
[33:10] incentives that make it uh irrelevant to
[33:13] even try so that's one of the
[33:15] non-financial risk that people are
[33:17] mentioning now another big one that
[33:19] people are often mentioning is what is
[33:22] the risk that Bitcoin is banned and in
[33:24] order to address that one uh I would
[33:27] like to take
[33:28] one historical example China China that
[33:32] is known to uh when they make decisions
[33:35] they are rather strong in it and they
[33:38] make it happen you know with full force
[33:40] not really caring about um things such
[33:44] as you know human rights or uh other
[33:47] let's say side effects of their big
[33:50] decisions the and when China decided to
[33:54] ban Bitcoin the first time of course
[33:56] nothing happened to the Bitcoin Network
[33:58] then they decided to ban it again uh I
[34:01] think it was 2017 nothing happened then
[34:03] they ban banned it again uh in 2021 this
[34:07] time much more strictly by Banning uh
[34:10] mining Banning any company uh to to work
[34:13] on any crypto asset in
[34:15] China and there you saw a very temporary
[34:18] drop in the hash rate because many
[34:21] Chinese miners actually stopped their
[34:23] operation in China moved elsewhere and
[34:27] uh continued mining mining from
[34:28] elsewhere and uh just three months after
[34:31] three or four months after the um the
[34:34] big ban of China you had the Bitcoin
[34:37] hash rate so the security of the network
[34:39] that was back to a oldtime high now
[34:43] China has proved one thing with this
[34:45] historical example is that even when you
[34:48] have one of the most powerful countries
[34:50] in the world enforcing a very strict
[34:53] rule to ban
[34:54] something well they are not able to make
[34:58] any difference uh for Bitcoin and if
[35:02] China with all of its efforts and its
[35:04] almost endless resources is completely
[35:06] unable to even threaten uh Bitcoin
[35:09] Network I don't think that any country
[35:12] any other country in the world uh
[35:14] willing to ban Bitcoin would manage to
[35:17] do anything to it the only thing you can
[35:19] do is Ban yourself from profiting from
[35:23] Bitcoin you can ban your own citizen
[35:25] from profiting from the future of
[35:27] Bitcoin the same way you can ban your
[35:29] citizen from using the internet like
[35:31] North Korea has done well does it make
[35:33] them better well it just you know it's
[35:36] just you're removing one technology one
[35:38] life-changing technology from reaching
[35:40] people in your population and uh from
[35:43] using it as as um member of of This
[35:48] Global uh
[35:50] scene so that's again just another
[35:53] non-financial risk that is often talked
[35:56] about and it's a fair concern to have uh
[35:59] but you know upon investigating it it's
[36:02] completely irrelevant and uh has no
[36:04] reason to uh to take the place in any
[36:07] debate on the
[36:09] topic I think and that's a great point
[36:12] of like um people often confuse the the
[36:17] risk of Bitcoin with the risk of a stock
[36:21] or with the risk of a company or risk of
[36:23] something else like the the one thing is
[36:25] a protocol like the tcpip protocol uh
[36:29] and the other things are like
[36:30] centralized companies uh that's for
[36:34] Bitcoin has protocal risks but not the
[36:37] company risks and it I think it speaks
[36:40] um it speaks to Bitcoin in a great way
[36:44] when the risks involved with with
[36:48] Bitcoin that are mentioned are uh the
[36:51] world has to come together in a world
[36:53] government and then ban Bitcoin then
[36:56] they might have a chance against
[36:58] if if we come to such extremes
[37:00] measurements when we count the risks of
[37:03] Bitcoin that that alone that fact alone
[37:06] tells you how resilient Bitcoin is
[37:09] because there are so many like if you
[37:10] just like take a company like Tesla
[37:13] there are so many risks involved with
[37:14] that you just you just look at their
[37:17] what they have to post as investor
[37:19] relationships uh what the risks are in
[37:21] that and there's like hundreds of risk I
[37:24] mean Michael sailor made an amazing
[37:26] video actually on that listing different
[37:29] risks for companies different risks for
[37:31] Real Estate uh and that just like opens
[37:34] your eyes to what what can go wrong what
[37:36] what small things can go wrong in a
[37:39] company um like even small things like
[37:42] uh if if if like El musk like just has a
[37:46] heart attack tomorrow that is a big
[37:49] risks to to to Tesla even though I think
[37:52] Tesla grew out of that that they're so
[37:54] dependent on El musk but still it's a
[37:56] big risk there's not one person that has
[37:59] a heart attack tomorrow that has a
[38:02] significant um uh impact on bitcoin even
[38:05] on the Bitcoin price I think like I
[38:08] could not think of one person that would
[38:10] like even if like Michael saor or Adam
[38:13] back or like zus uh that has no impact
[38:17] on on bitcoin I think in that regard so
[38:20] that that is something uh I think
[38:22] especially for people that are newer in
[38:23] the space to think about absolutely uh
[38:26] ultimately the Point you're making is
[38:28] the difference between a security and a
[38:30] commodity you know security is an
[38:32] instrument where you have an uh an
[38:36] entity behind it a person or or an
[38:38] institution or a group of people that
[38:40] have undue influence on the protocol
[38:43] that have inference to change what uh
[38:46] you
[38:47] know what the value of that asset is
[38:50] compared to a commodity you know it is
[38:53] just it is just there uh you don't have
[38:56] any person or group that can can
[38:57] influence it um the same way gold I mean
[39:01] you can have some people with a lot of
[39:03] gold but no matter what you know one
[39:05] person or institution or company thinks
[39:08] about it you they're not going to change
[39:10] the the characteristics of gold or the
[39:15] they're not going to change
[39:15] fundamentally what it is and Bitcoin in
[39:18] that respect is very similar uh to to
[39:22] gold in the sense that it is a commodity
[39:24] it is independent from the influence of
[39:26] any centralized
[39:28] uh institution or person and that also
[39:30] makes Bitcoin very different from any
[39:33] other crypto asset which uh they are all
[39:36] to some level centralized to some level
[39:38] dependent on the group of people you
[39:40] know uh people saying hey let's change
[39:43] from proof of work to proof of stake and
[39:45] you know and making that happen or
[39:46] canceling transaction or you know these
[39:49] kind of things cannot happen for Bitcoin
[39:52] uh which makes it a truly unique robust
[39:55] independent commodity yeah that's that's
[39:57] that's a unique point that uh a lot of
[39:59] people actually uh yeah we have to do a
[40:02] good job educating more
[40:04] people that's kind of uh we we have a we
[40:07] have a strong mandate to to educate
[40:10] people uh that that's that's the thing
[40:13] um when we think about what Bitcoin is
[40:16] it's also interesting for me uh and
[40:18] different people look at it differently
[40:19] how do you look at uh what what what
[40:21] Bitcoin uh is for you is it uh like
[40:25] people come to the conclusion like it's
[40:27] an asset people come to the conclusion
[40:29] oh it's a way of life it's an exit
[40:32] strategy whatever is is like what is the
[40:35] the main point for you of of Bitcoin
[40:37] what what what what aspect of Bitcoin
[40:40] speaks the loudest to
[40:42] you um well obviously there are some
[40:47] let's say side effects of Bitcoin that
[40:50] are very attractive like the fact that
[40:53] if you invest in Bitcoin well you are
[40:54] increasing your wealth drastically which
[40:57] obviously is something you will not
[40:58] easily say no to but uh what really
[41:01] speaks to me about Bitcoin is not that
[41:04] is the fact that it's the genuine
[41:07] independent uh asset genuinely neutral
[41:11] so it is not something that can be
[41:14] corrupted it is not something that can
[41:16] be used for political ends so it is not
[41:19] you know it is not racist it is not uh
[41:22] for men or for women it is not for
[41:25] Americans or for European or for African
[41:27] it is a genuinely neutral commodity
[41:31] which I believe is precisely the kind of
[41:33] thing that we need to bring us together
[41:35] and reset the base uh of the entire
[41:38] Financial system a base layer that is
[41:42] genuinely neutral that does not
[41:45] discriminate neither based on uh skin
[41:47] color nor nationality nor gender nor
[41:51] political affiliation nor any other
[41:53] criteria something neutral for everybody
[41:56] to use according to the same rules no
[41:59] matter what anybody thinks about it and
[42:02] I think that with this base then Society
[42:06] can build something that makes sense and
[42:08] unfortunately what we have seen uh with
[42:11] you know the politization of financial
[42:16] instruments and of the monetary networks
[42:19] uh that that has probably destroyed
[42:21] society and divided Society I'm taking
[42:23] you know using the dollars as uh as a
[42:27] way to export inflation for example so
[42:30] let me explain that the US dollar is
[42:33] used as Global Reserve currency so there
[42:36] are many other countries that are using
[42:38] US dollar as their currency or as base
[42:41] to give value to their currency
[42:42] therefore when the Federal Reserve is
[42:45] printing more dollars I mean they are
[42:46] creating some inflation locally but they
[42:48] are also creating inflation outside of
[42:51] their country but obviously you know the
[42:54] dollars that they are printing they're
[42:55] using them you know for the US interest
[42:57] not for you know the African countries
[42:59] using the US dollar or for the South
[43:02] American countries doing the same so it
[43:05] is a way for the US to export their
[43:07] inflation in other words it is a way to
[43:10] politicize you know monetary network to
[43:13] use it to their advantage you know
[43:14] basically exploiting countries that are
[43:17] already in need countries that are
[43:18] already poor you know taking even more
[43:21] wealth from them and accumulating it in
[43:23] the hands of uh of the already wealthy
[43:25] Nations now Bitcoin is completely
[43:27] changing this game and setting a new
[43:30] base for every nation to be able to
[43:33] prosper from a clean slate from uh
[43:37] without having this uh big country or
[43:39] institution taking advantage of them and
[43:42] I think that creating this you know
[43:44] strong Bas for the world to to build
[43:46] upon is uh is the way how to to build a
[43:49] strong Society for the future so that's
[43:51] how I see Bitcoin and the most
[43:54] transformational uh aspect of Bitcoin
[43:57] that's beautiful I think that that that
[43:59] that's what uh we hope for that Bitcoin
[44:02] is also doing for the world laughed a
[44:04] lot um for the last uh part of the
[44:07] podcast uh I want to focus uh as you are
[44:11] as you said CFO of really um what impact
[44:14] Bitcoin has on
[44:16] businesses uh especially when you all of
[44:19] the sudden have uh really good asset
[44:22] which is your new hurdle rate with like
[44:25] okay what happens to the startups what
[44:26] Happ to venture capital what happens to
[44:29] the to the financial space overall once
[44:32] you kind of accept that there is a new
[44:34] way of saving money and that saving
[44:36] money is now not losing value but that
[44:39] saving money is actually gaining you
[44:41] purchasing power uh how do you look at
[44:44] the impact that Bitcoin will have on
[44:47] businesses on startups venture capital
[44:49] and and all the things uh in in
[44:51] finance um all right let me start with
[44:55] uh the smmes that understand the
[44:57] potential of Bitcoin let's say for
[44:59] example real estate companies uh there
[45:01] are actually quite some real estate
[45:03] companies that are buying uh Bitcoin for
[45:05] their balance sheet several of which are
[45:07] going through relay to do that and
[45:09] that's how we get some insights into
[45:11] their business model and why they are
[45:12] doing that look when you are building a
[45:15] house and you know that in 20 years in
[45:17] 30 years you will need to renovate the
[45:19] roof and you know uh do some adjustments
[45:22] to the walls and maybe change the
[45:24] windows well you know that you have a
[45:25] future expense
[45:27] so you need to ensure yourself against
[45:31] that future expense so basically imun
[45:32] immunize your portfolio so your this
[45:35] future liability with an asset that will
[45:37] match that future liability and what
[45:40] these real estate companies are doing is
[45:41] that for every house they build they buy
[45:43] some Bitcoin in order to you know ensure
[45:46] themselves against the future liability
[45:49] and I think this is a great way to think
[45:51] about it because this is the asset that
[45:54] will maintain its value best actually
[45:57] since we are so early in the space that
[45:59] will most likely increase in value
[46:01] massively over a long period of time of
[46:04] 20 plus years and um and therefore will
[46:08] strengthen their uh the long-term
[46:11] Prospect of this
[46:12] company now not only these companies
[46:15] with future liabilities have a strong
[46:19] interest in buying Bitcoin you also have
[46:22] uh let's say much more regular and
[46:24] traditional uh smmes that are that are
[46:27] adding Bitcoin to their uh treasury
[46:29] through relay I'm thinking of people
[46:31] such as you know Brick Layers or
[46:36] dentist
[46:37] sorry and um many other let's say more
[46:41] traditional non Financial related uh
[46:45] companies uh that just realize that this
[46:48] is clearly the best way of building a
[46:50] strong treasury does that answer your
[46:52] question yeah that's uh that's super
[46:55] interesting when when we look at that um
[46:58] and one thing that I'm also curious
[47:01] about that is when we have now Bitcoin
[47:07] as the new Reserve currency in uh having
[47:12] financial decision makings like there's
[47:15] always this uh wondering I even had a
[47:18] conversation a a few weeks ago where uh
[47:22] someone was like okay do I I have a good
[47:25] paying job but I don't like it that much
[47:27] uh but I really like that I can stack a
[47:30] good amount of ss there and and he was
[47:32] pondering off thought like okay what if
[47:34] I now go out of that job start my own
[47:37] Venture and uh probably have the next
[47:41] year maybe few years uh no or next no
[47:46] income maybe I even have to get to my
[47:49] savings uh and this uh it's this this um
[47:53] opportunity cost of of what Bitcoin
[47:56] creates because it's such an uh strong
[47:59] asset that you really want to hold on to
[48:02] it uh it could create like a a a world
[48:06] of of Savers uh which accumulate a lot a
[48:09] lot of capital and then make hopefully
[48:12] better decisions with their Capital
[48:14] allocation when Once to get to
[48:16] businesses once they go go uh towards
[48:19] that that's kind of like where um I I
[48:23] think we're going and the the the
[48:26] question that is for me underneath that
[48:28] all is like um H how do you decide in
[48:32] how different is it the deciding of like
[48:35] what do you invest in in a Bitcoin World
[48:37] versus in a Fiat world where in fat
[48:39] World your base savings technology uh is
[48:43] like losing value all the time and in a
[48:45] Bitcoin World your base uh layer of uh
[48:49] in in in Saving is actually purchase bar
[48:53] uh but that's kind of like where um
[48:56] where where I'm standing and I'm still
[48:58] like kind of uh not sure how how this is
[49:01] going what's the impact of sound money
[49:03] on on a global scale is for for
[49:07] Investments um one thing that definely
[49:09] that definitely change uh changes in
[49:11] that respect uh with a Bitcoin with
[49:14] Bitcoin being part of the landscape at
[49:17] least is The Benchmark that companies
[49:19] are having if you're a big Venture
[49:22] company you know that well you can do
[49:24] two things either you can can invest in
[49:28] companies or you can put your money in
[49:30] Bitcoin which an with an expected uh
[49:33] rate of return of roughly 50% per year
[49:36] on average over you know over a period
[49:39] of time of more than four years the
[49:41] first option so investing in companies
[49:43] you need to understand that you need to
[49:45] be at least better than Bitcoin to even
[49:48] be worth considering and actually since
[49:50] the companies has a lot more risk you
[49:52] need to be a lot better than the
[49:54] expected return of Bitcoin to uh to be
[49:57] able to compete with the simple
[49:59] investment of just putting your money in
[50:02] Bitcoin so from Venture Capital
[50:05] perspective you know it completely
[50:08] changes the the
[50:10] base um hurdle rate because now you have
[50:14] you know either you have this company
[50:16] bringing you a lot more than what
[50:18] Bitcoin would bring you on average uh to
[50:21] compensate for the additional risk or
[50:22] you just put yourself your funds into
[50:25] Bitcoin so it definitely increases the
[50:28] bar and it will force companies to uh to
[50:31] think about new ways of reaching this
[50:35] kind of um rates of return which
[50:37] honestly given how the economy is going
[50:40] is just next to impossible to achieve if
[50:43] you are outside of you know deep Tech or
[50:47] uh or Bitcoin itself you know you can be
[50:49] in Ai and reach that kind of returns
[50:52] like Nvidia or you can be in Bitcoin uh
[50:55] which again
[50:57] largely offers a largely Superior return
[51:00] to Nvidia uh as we are as we have seen
[51:03] when you compare micro strategy to
[51:04] Nvidia over the last few years where
[51:07] micro strategy has uh has outperformed
[51:10] even Nvidia and of course all other uh
[51:14] companies of the S&P 500 so this changes
[51:19] so Bitcoin basically changes the base
[51:21] The Benchmark for uh
[51:24] investment absolutely yeah that's very
[51:26] right really cool uh thank you so much
[51:28] for that um it has uh always one
[51:31] question that I asked all of my guests
[51:33] um uh towards is what can we learn from
[51:38] you besides Bitcoin that's a good
[51:40] question I've been focused on Bitcoin
[51:43] now for a few years so uh all of my
[51:45] thoughts are around it um one thing that
[51:49] I'm also passionate about is uh is
[51:51] Triathlon so um especially long distance
[51:54] Triathlon and I've been uh for example
[51:56] I've been competing in the um full Iron
[52:00] Man European Championship a few years
[52:02] ago and I'm very proud of having
[52:04] finished it uh in time that was in
[52:06] Frankfurt
[52:08] 2017 um so yeah if you want to to hear
[52:12] more about Triathlon and a longdistance
[52:14] endurance training uh that's that's also
[52:16] something I'm very keen on talking about
[52:19] I I love that a lot yeah I I know one of
[52:22] the three things I'm a
[52:24] swimmer and I I I run actually a lot
[52:27] also uh but I really don't like
[52:31] biking I couldn't do
[52:33] it all right well that's for I'm coming
[52:36] from running and I had to I had to learn
[52:39] how to swim properly and how to bike it
[52:41] really it's yeah it just comes very
[52:44] quickly and then when you come when you
[52:45] combine that you actually learn to like
[52:47] the the switch between the three because
[52:49] then you work literally every muscle in
[52:51] the body and um and the triatlon as a
[52:54] discipline in itself is uh is really
[52:57] enjoyable one absolutely really cool
[53:00] perfect then let's come to the end
[53:01] routin of the podcast where the previous
[53:03] guest is asking a question for the next
[53:05] guest without knowing who the next guest
[53:06] actually is and your question is um if
[53:11] you were skeptical in the beginning uh
[53:14] your bit of your Bitcoin story what did
[53:16] change your
[53:19] mind um I definitely was skeptical and I
[53:22] would like to bring a quick story on
[53:24] that I remember in 20
[53:27] 15 if I'm not mistaken I was uh standing
[53:30] in front of the full Board of um risk
[53:33] management Board of ing in Germany where
[53:35] I was working at the time so the third
[53:37] largest bank of Germany um and I was the
[53:40] local expert on blockchain technology
[53:42] and I was telling them look at$ 400 and
[53:46] something dollars per Bitcoin Bitcoin is
[53:48] grossly
[53:49] overpriced well how much I hope that I
[53:52] had both at the time but um yeah I did
[53:56] didn't because I was conscious of the
[53:58] very high likelihood of failure of
[53:59] Bitcoin and maybe I was right at the
[54:01] time because the you know the risk was
[54:03] just so high that maybe it wasn't even
[54:05] justifying such a price at the time now
[54:09] what did change my mind when I was a
[54:11] skeptic was uh looking at Bitcoin on the
[54:15] uh adjusted return perspective so what I
[54:18] mentioned earlier you know looking at
[54:19] sharp ratios looking at other metrics
[54:21] that Express similar things so excess
[54:24] return compared to risk like the sting
[54:26] ratio and when I understood oh actually
[54:29] it's you know yes it's more volatile but
[54:32] it's it offers you so much more return
[54:35] that the volatility is actually
[54:37] irrelevant um that really changed my
[54:40] mind on um on bitcoin and that's how I
[54:44] started my
[54:45] journey really cool because we mentioned
[54:47] it now two times uh what exactly is the
[54:51] the sharp ratio how what data is coming
[54:54] into that so CH ratio is excess return
[54:58] divided by excess risk uh both compared
[55:00] to a benchmark so it is more how much
[55:04] more return you bring so an asset would
[55:06] bring compared to how much more risk it
[55:08] is risk being defined as volatility so
[55:11] again okay risk is volatility yeah
[55:13] exactly so uh if let's say Bitcoin
[55:16] brings you 50% return a year with 10%
[55:20] volatility well it's a sharp ratio of
[55:22] five I mean here I'm comparing to
[55:24] Benchmark of zero but uh it would be a
[55:26] sharp sharp ratio of five compared to
[55:28] let's say S&P 500 with an average return
[55:31] I'm making up numbers but let's say of
[55:33] seven with volatility of 3.5% and
[55:36] therefore that would be a sharp ratio of
[55:38] two so when you compare the two you are
[55:40] able to say this one is more interesting
[55:43] on a risk adjusted basis and that's
[55:45] where Bitcoin is second to
[55:47] n uh that's that's super interesting
[55:50] even though I I really don't like
[55:54] calling Vol volatility risk it's a
[55:57] short-term risk uh if you need money but
[56:00] that you can avoid that with just like
[56:02] having not everything in Bitcoin that
[56:06] then then it's not not a risk anymore if
[56:08] you you don't plan for any things but
[56:09] yeah it's uh it's it's it's funny like
[56:13] it's also like when I when I talk with
[56:15] people and oh no it's so risky and I'm
[56:16] like okay what what's the risk of
[56:17] Bitcoin and always volatility comes up
[56:20] oh the price R like people really have
[56:22] like volatility risk risk volatility it
[56:24] feels like well this is the official
[56:27] definition of risk in traditional
[56:29] Finance risk is standard deviation of
[56:32] return so volatility is literally how
[56:34] risk is defined in traditional Finance
[56:36] which as I said I think is completely
[56:38] misleading because Bitcoin is risk of
[56:41] asset you want less risk well invest in
[56:44] Bitcoin absolutely yeah really cool yeah
