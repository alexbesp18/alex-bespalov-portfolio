[00:00] yeah I mean there's there's a problem
[00:02] especially now that [ __ ] coining is so
[00:03] easy like I I don't know if you know
[00:05] this uh site I think it's called like
[00:07] pump fun or something where I mean no
[00:09] technical ability needed you can just
[00:10] launch launch a token I wouldn't even
[00:13] classify them as [ __ ] coins anymore it's
[00:16] then it sort of gets to what what It
[00:17] ultimately could be something like
[00:19] digital Collectibles trashing lightning
[00:21] is has become sort of a meme nowadays
[00:24] but uh and I'm I'm definitely not
[00:25] against lightning I think lightning is
[00:27] obviously a big technical achievement in
[00:30] Bitcoin the biggest misconception people
[00:32] have about Bitcoin is that it's one of
[00:34] the cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is
[00:37] just one it's okay it was the first but
[00:40] uh Nokia used to be bigger than Apple in
[00:42] in phones and now Nokia's dead so that's
[00:45] going to happen to bitcoin or you know
[00:46] Bitcoin is the Myspace and soon we're
[00:48] going to see the the Facebook but people
[00:51] really need to understand the difference
[00:54] between a commodity and a security
[00:59] [Music]
[01:01] you you're testing Sam or Samuel no i' I
[01:05] said I've tried to avoid Sam for some
[01:08] historical reasons um but
[01:11] uh oh s
[01:15] s yeah but I mean I'm not against it but
[01:18] but mostly I go by Samuel yeah yeah it's
[01:22] uh it's it's interesting how you you
[01:25] don't want to be connected to a bad it's
[01:27] actually um there is another Rob that is
[01:30] doing YouTube and he he's talking about
[01:33] Bitcoin but also a lot about [ __ ]
[01:34] coining and uh actually I got attacked
[01:38] on Twitter already of like oh you're a
[01:40] [ __ ] coiner and I'm like no like I'm
[01:42] only Bitcoin and he's like oh yes you're
[01:45] a different Robin just because my name
[01:47] is similar yeah I mean there's there's a
[01:50] problem especially now that [ __ ] coining
[01:52] is so easy like I I don't know if you
[01:54] know this uh site I think it's called
[01:56] like pump fun or something where I mean
[01:58] no technical ability needed you can just
[02:00] launch launch a token uh we've had some
[02:03] tokens some Zelo tokens launched we see
[02:06] we've tried to uh uh discredit them uh
[02:10] publicly but it's it's it's definitely
[02:13] difficult um feels like uh the last last
[02:16] cycle there was at least some barrier to
[02:19] entry considering there was some
[02:21] technical uh technical steps to
[02:24] deploying like a shitcoin but now it's
[02:26] like it's the Wild Wild West times
[02:28] 10 so it's rough people people go ahead
[02:32] and build a shitcoin pumping just based
[02:36] on your name are they also using your
[02:38] your brand your icon and everything yeah
[02:41] yeah exactly so I mean yeah using our
[02:45] logo using like linking linking it to
[02:48] our website using our name um launching
[02:52] tokens like that that's crazy yeah yeah
[02:55] it is luckily they haven't uh haven't
[02:58] taken off um
[03:00] but I mean it's it's still it's still
[03:02] annoying because it's like many people
[03:04] will think it's it's uh like we have
[03:06] something to do with it and obviously if
[03:08] they were to take off and something
[03:09] would happen I mean we would probably
[03:11] get some comments comments from that but
[03:14] I mean this is just what what we have to
[03:15] get used to I guess and it's super
[03:18] interesting because like imagine what
[03:20] happens to to to the bigger Bitcoin only
[03:24] exchanges like a relay or like uh bigger
[03:27] Bitcoin only companies in general
[03:30] uh where where they probably see like
[03:34] 20x of all those crazy crazy things
[03:37] because I always think of like I have so
[03:39] many impersonators and spammers that
[03:43] actually contact even like cousins of
[03:45] mine it's really funny because I never
[03:47] talk to them in English I always talk to
[03:49] them in German and and he's writing to
[03:51] me on on on WhatsApp like oh why why you
[03:53] writing to me in English like that's
[03:55] probably not me uh so uh I'm thinking of
[03:59] like what what is it in like 10x bigger
[04:02] shoes and like 20x big shoes like scale
[04:06] of it is just
[04:07] unable yeah it is it is and I mean I
[04:11] guess the only thing you can do is is to
[04:13] uh yeah be be open openly against
[04:16] shitcoins now
[04:18] like yeah it used to be used to be a bit
[04:21] easier you could just uh yeah not not
[04:24] mention them but just focus on Bitcoin
[04:27] in your messaging but now now it feels
[04:28] like you kind of have to be like against
[04:31] against shitcoins in order to not seem
[04:33] for them because they're just popping
[04:35] popping Mar everywhere and yeah unless
[04:40] you openly discredit them how do you
[04:42] think uh um shitcoins and I also want to
[04:46] say altcoins because some people when I
[04:48] say shitcoins think I'm only talking
[04:50] about specific altcoins uh so I'm I'm
[04:53] usually like tring like just like all
[04:55] altcoins uh for me all altcoins are [ __ ]
[04:58] coins uh but uh just to be clear here
[05:01] but um where do you see alins in general
[05:05] moving forward is it just something that
[05:08] will go away over some time or is that
[05:10] something that will stick around uh
[05:14] because like there's always like a small
[05:16] group of people that just like want to
[05:17] gamble with with some thing with like
[05:20] digital art or
[05:22] whatever yeah I think it's it's going to
[05:25] decrease significantly the interest in
[05:27] them I think it's going to uh going to
[05:29] move move uh more towards like like a
[05:32] very Niche meme coin thing probably like
[05:35] these
[05:36] uh at that point it's it's not it's it's
[05:39] most likely not even I wouldn't even
[05:41] classify them as [ __ ] coins anymore it's
[05:45] then then it sort of gets to what what
[05:47] it like ultimately could be something
[05:49] like digital Collectibles like I'm not
[05:51] against digital Collectibles personally
[05:53] I'm not buying them I don't really care
[05:55] like that's not my thing but like if if
[05:59] someone
[06:00] someone created like a funny meme and
[06:04] and decided to make a a a shitcoin out
[06:07] of it and you know do something I'm I'm
[06:10] like I don't want I don't want to throw
[06:12] them in jail that's what I'm saying but
[06:14] it's like uh I I think it's going to
[06:16] decrease significantly I think it's
[06:18] going to become a very relevant part of
[06:19] the market I don't I don't think it's
[06:21] going to even be considered a part of
[06:23] the the the Bitcoin Market
[06:27] or yeah I wouldn't even put them in the
[06:29] same same uh category of assets so
[06:33] completely different uh when we have to
[06:36] really pound that till it's very
[06:39] abundantly clear that it's not the same
[06:40] thing because but it gets more and more
[06:42] clear as like now we even have like
[06:44] politicians and and and Company leaders
[06:48] and and and really great thinkers and
[06:50] popular people that make the difference
[06:52] between Bitcoin and all other other
[06:54] things um but I actually wanted to start
[06:56] with something different today uh
[06:59] because you are one of the guests that
[07:01] are returning on the podcast now that
[07:03] the podcast is
[07:04] already uh 13 or 14 months or something
[07:08] like that old um I'm having my first uh
[07:10] returning guests um so for you what what
[07:14] is the most interesting thing that
[07:16] happened in the last 12 months uh since
[07:19] the last time you were on what what was
[07:21] kind of standing out for
[07:23] you H the most interesting thing in the
[07:26] last roughly year or so
[07:29] I mean I would definitely say it's it's
[07:32] more more of like a
[07:35] general General feel in the market um I
[07:39] don't think we've had
[07:41] anything radically radically uh
[07:45] different technically or or anything
[07:47] like that that sort of uh changed the
[07:50] game completely Bitcoin is interesting
[07:52] because a lot of the the
[07:55] technical uh technical sort of
[07:57] advancements that will happen in Bitcoin
[07:59] have you can sort of foresee them like
[08:00] if you're in the space you can foresee
[08:02] them years years before they happen
[08:04] because Bitcoin is is uh like a slowly
[08:08] developing organism on the internet sort
[08:10] of so I wouldn't say there's anything on
[08:12] the on the technical side I think it's
[08:15] it's more on the uh the institutional
[08:17] adoption side I know this is kind of
[08:20] kind of like a a cliche at this point
[08:23] cringe but I mean
[08:25] there's there's not really really much
[08:28] else going on up I'm I'm
[08:30] like a big fan of what sailor says in
[08:34] this this aspect as well like we need
[08:37] the people with the money and the
[08:38] influence to come into the space uh for
[08:41] it to to sort of get to the next level
[08:44] um I I think the Bitcoin journey is is
[08:48] like I said a journey uh where you know
[08:51] people come in they they like it it
[08:53] doesn't really matter how they come in
[08:55] like whether it's coinbase binance and
[08:57] ETF
[08:59] um you know wherever like physical
[09:02] Bitcoins doesn't matter how you got into
[09:04] the space I mean once once you get into
[09:07] get into Bitcoin and and you start to
[09:10] understand the the
[09:11] fundamental promise of Bitcoin then you
[09:14] start to understand sort of the
[09:17] technical side too and and like best
[09:20] practices for custody and and sort of uh
[09:25] you're able to see the the potential
[09:27] that Bitcoin has going forward so so
[09:30] yeah I'm just personally uh personally
[09:32] very happy that that there are a lot
[09:34] more um normos so to say coming into the
[09:38] space I mean we're we're uh zelux is uh
[09:41] sponsoring uh an event here in Helsinki
[09:44] BTC hell I mean you should you should
[09:46] definitely come uh we have some some
[09:49] interesting speakers from the the Trad f
[09:51] space coming too um and this is
[09:55] something that that I sort of yeah see
[09:58] see has a very big big step forward I
[10:00] have a I have a lot of friends who study
[10:03] uh economics or Keynesian
[10:05] economics uh I wouldn't consider that
[10:08] economics necessarily but
[10:10] uh they study kesian economics in in
[10:13] University and and it's it's very
[10:15] interesting to see that that Bitcoin is
[10:17] creeping in there too
[10:20] and obviously it's because the price is
[10:22] going up but that's that's ngu number go
[10:25] up technology that's what it's supposed
[10:27] to do and and yeah that's that's what
[10:29] what I'm really excited
[10:31] about there is something really
[10:33] interesting I mean I want to dive deep
[10:35] in that but you just reminded me of a
[10:37] conversation I had with an old friend
[10:39] that is now studying social economics in
[10:42] Austria and I was like what is that [ __ ]
[10:46] social economics but but I asked him
[10:48] like oh like what are you what are you
[10:50] learning and stuff like that and then I
[10:51] really quickly also asked like oh like
[10:53] you probably learn kan's in economics
[10:55] like the central bank is good we need
[10:57] inflation and stuff like that and he's
[10:58] like no not like we we're currently
[11:00] learning that the central bank doesn't
[11:02] do anything and that if it wouldn't be
[11:04] there uh it wouldn't really make a
[11:07] difference I was like okay you're going
[11:10] in the right direction it would
[11:11] definitely make a difference if there's
[11:12] no Central Bank uh but with the saying
[11:15] of like it it they don't really add
[11:18] value they don't really do anything
[11:20] productive in society that's already
[11:23] very good and I was super surprised
[11:25] honestly uh he never heard about
[11:27] Austrian economics or haek or something
[11:28] like that he's also like just in the
[11:30] first year so let's let's give let's
[11:33] give them time but um it it kind of
[11:35] surprised me the the that maybe there
[11:38] are some uh economic professors and and
[11:42] trefi people that actually waking up and
[11:44] actually trying to to educate them
[11:47] outside of K and economics and um I
[11:50] think the point of like we have to get
[11:53] normal people and uh normal we are
[11:56] normal people but like uh we we we have
[11:59] to get like um people from tradire in we
[12:02] have to get the institutions in we have
[12:04] to get basketball players football
[12:06] players soccer players like all of the
[12:08] the players in and and and and I think
[12:11] way broader in in in that that sphere I
[12:14] loved having uh candy Flor and and renat
[12:18] moano on the show like UFC fighters
[12:21] because
[12:22] they you there might be a UFC fan uh in
[12:27] in your family and you can send do that
[12:29] podcast to him because he he might
[12:31] listen to Renato uh he probably don't
[12:34] listen to me but he might listen to
[12:36] renat moano so I think we we at this
[12:40] point where we figured out the base
[12:42] layer I think there probably won't be a
[12:45] lot of changes there there will be some
[12:47] changes there has to be some changes in
[12:49] the long run otherwise like I think
[12:51] without Buck fixing a lot of small
[12:54] changes we probably uh won't make it but
[12:57] um uh the the most changes will be in
[13:00] the ecosystem and I think it will be in
[13:02] the next few years only about like hey
[13:05] this country is adopting it hey that
[13:06] compan is adopting hey that individual
[13:09] is buying Bitcoin that's the news of the
[13:11] next years
[13:12] right yeah and and yeah it's it's very
[13:15] good to see that uh that even even the
[13:19] people who sort of haven't understood
[13:21] Bitcoin yet they've sort of understood
[13:23] the ethos like I see I see I see a lot
[13:27] of
[13:29] people who seem very Pro Bitcoin in the
[13:32] way they talk about the economy the way
[13:34] they talk about you know uh central
[13:37] banks banking in general like
[13:39] Finance um taxation governmental
[13:42] overreach uh regulatory capture stuff
[13:45] like this like they they are they're
[13:47] they're on the right track like they
[13:49] they've UND they've understood the
[13:51] problems like that's you know all always
[13:53] step one like once you can identify a
[13:55] problem then then you can sort of start
[13:57] looking for an answer and yeah still
[14:00] maybe like a couple couple years ago 3
[14:03] four years ago
[14:04] like there wasn't really the same
[14:06] feeling of people having discovered the
[14:09] problem yet I was I was very fortunate
[14:11] because I lived in Argentina uh in 2019
[14:13] so I sort of the problem was like
[14:16] problem hit me in my face you know I
[14:17] couldn't I couldn't miss it but uh uh
[14:21] most people who who haven't uh lived
[14:25] lived in a a country with hyperinflation
[14:27] it's it's harder for them to to see the
[14:28] problem but now in the in the past past
[14:31] year or two I've seen a lot of people
[14:33] waking up to the problem and that's good
[14:35] because that's step one step one is
[14:37] recognizing the problem step two is
[14:38] finding the solution obviously some of
[14:40] them will like you say it's a it's a
[14:43] long and rocky road like some of them
[14:45] will will you know uh fall into some
[14:48] shitcoin traps fall into other traps
[14:51] maybe think gold is the solution yeah
[14:53] maybe maybe think something else is the
[14:55] solution but I mean I personally think
[14:58] ultimately they will arrive at Bitcoin
[15:00] and and that's good and I'm just trying
[15:02] to position myself and and my company to
[15:04] be in a place where you know in five
[15:08] years in 10 years we're sort of
[15:12] uh riding the wave like it's it's uh
[15:15] it's going to be tough for the uh for
[15:18] the next couple years I think for uh for
[15:22] people in the Bitcoin space again I mean
[15:24] I think Bitcoin will uh obviously still
[15:27] go up but but it will also come down and
[15:30] that's that's when education will be
[15:32] very important because otherwise
[15:35] otherwise there will be a lot of people
[15:37] who
[15:38] uh yeah who who who who won't find the
[15:41] solution even though they have all the
[15:44] prerequisites to do so so that's that's
[15:46] personally why I'm why I uh I'm a big
[15:49] fan of all all types of Bitcoin
[15:51] educational content the the paino is
[15:54] really interesting because I it's like
[15:58] how much inflation does a country need
[15:59] to really get
[16:01] Bitcoin uh and we've seen turkey
[16:04] Argentina and so many more where they
[16:08] still don't get Bitcoin to a degree that
[16:12] I think would make sense um so it's like
[16:16] they're going to Gold they're going to
[16:18] other shitcoins uh like the US dollar or
[16:21] like other other things like that so I'm
[16:23] like okay they they get that they have
[16:27] to ditch the the bad money for a little
[16:30] bit better money like the US dollar is
[16:32] better than the Turkish Li so they're
[16:34] upgrading their money uh but but they're
[16:38] they're not they're not they're just
[16:40] trying to survive they're not trying to
[16:42] solve the problem they're not seeing
[16:44] like okay what is what is the best money
[16:46] I can adopt uh they're not asking that
[16:49] question they're like what what can I
[16:50] adopt that I survive right now and and z
[16:53] in those poor countries uh Argentina
[16:56] also Turkish uh in the tur and stuff
[16:59] like that like it's usually like the
[17:02] dollar or maybe also the euro in some
[17:04] countries where this is the more
[17:06] dominant uh currency and they are just
[17:09] like trading up on the on the the Fiat
[17:12] coins and not uh completely changing the
[17:15] system they're changing just to a within
[17:18] the system and not into a new system
[17:20] which is kind of frustrating for me of
[17:23] like how can we Bridge those people from
[17:26] feat to bitcoin and not to better F
[17:30] currency which makes the problem not go
[17:32] away just maybe
[17:34] smaller yeah that's that's a good point
[17:37] too I mean we we definitely do want uh
[17:41] want a final solution not not sort of a
[17:43] temporary solution but it's also I mean
[17:48] even even though I would obviously want
[17:50] countries to adopt the Bitcoin standard
[17:52] it's still good to like I think we
[17:54] talked last time like we want the ship
[17:55] to sort of sink slowly so that people
[17:57] have time to get into the life boats but
[18:00] um yeah I I still
[18:03] think there's a lot to do with with
[18:06] Bitcoin before it can even be um before
[18:09] it can even be Mass adopted like there
[18:11] there are definitely some um some
[18:15] technical challenges to solve and some
[18:18] even I would say more philosophical
[18:19] challenges too
[18:22] like yeah
[18:24] obviously obviously Bitcoin custody is
[18:26] something we work on and it's it's
[18:28] something I'm passionate about and it's
[18:30] something I I sort of feel like has to
[18:33] has to get to the next level before it
[18:35] even uh even kind of makes sense
[18:39] for a huge huge amount of people to to
[18:42] be on boarded into Bitcoin obviously
[18:45] that there's there's
[18:46] different like different levels to to
[18:49] bitcoin uh you know you can have your
[18:52] Bitcoin on Exchange that's good I mean
[18:55] you you have some Bitcoin exposure
[18:59] maybe you could say that I mean that's
[19:01] it's bit of a gray area whether whe
[19:04] whether or not you do uh depends on how
[19:06] solving the exchange is um but um
[19:10] obviously for for people to to actually
[19:13] get into self- custody and and actually
[19:17] hold their own Keys like that's that's
[19:20] what I think is the long-term winning
[19:22] winning goal and the the incentives are
[19:23] just there for that uh but um yeah I
[19:27] think there's there's still a long Long
[19:28] Way Long Way to to get to that
[19:31] point what what what do we have to kind
[19:34] of in improve still it's more about the
[19:37] ecosystem the technical ecosystem of
[19:39] layer two and three I
[19:42] guess yeah I think I mean trashing
[19:46] lightning is uh is has become sort of a
[19:50] meme meme nowadays but uh and I'm I'm
[19:52] definitely not against lightning I think
[19:54] lightning is
[19:55] obviously a big a big uh
[19:59] technical achievement in in
[20:01] Bitcoin
[20:03] but I mean it's it's become pretty
[20:05] obvious during the last couple years
[20:08] that lightning alone isn't going to
[20:09] scale Bitcoin in a self- custodial
[20:12] manner like if we just uh think think
[20:16] through our own experiences like we we
[20:19] both been to some Bitcoin conferences
[20:22] like I think you'll agree that the the
[20:24] industry standard is is to use something
[20:26] like wallet of Satoshi right of Satoshi
[20:29] as a as a spendings account if you're
[20:30] spending
[20:32] Bitcoin um and obviously like what the
[20:36] difference between wallet of Satoshi and
[20:38] and for example coinbase is kind of
[20:41] non-existent right like except the fact
[20:45] that coinbase is a publicly listed
[20:47] company and you know the the founder is
[20:50] very publicly like open with his own
[20:53] own real real name and real face but um
[20:58] yeah the these these so-called layer 2
[21:00] is like
[21:03] um yeah light lightning mainly is is is
[21:06] not not in my opinion the the U the
[21:11] final solution to scaling in a in a
[21:15] non-custodial manner I mean there are
[21:17] obviously always
[21:18] tradeoffs but uh I I just I just don't
[21:21] think we're there
[21:23] yet I I think the last time we talked
[21:25] actually also briefly about fediman um I
[21:30] think you were actually the first person
[21:32] that that brought it up to my attention
[21:34] actually I think I think um I think it
[21:37] was your podcast where the first time I
[21:39] ever heard about fedin and then I was
[21:40] like oh like researching about it like
[21:42] oh interesting what's going on on there
[21:46] um is that maybe paired with with
[21:49] lightning maybe paired with other layer
[21:51] tools I'm more of the solution of like
[21:53] we have maybe one two three layer twos
[21:57] and then like federations and and and
[21:59] ecash systems and stuff like
[22:01] that yeah absolutely um I think
[22:05] lightning is sort of like maybe we can
[22:09] start with with you
[22:11] know thinking thinking about how Bitcoin
[22:15] could scale like what what are the
[22:17] options like
[22:18] obviously you could you could go the
[22:22] route of something like Bitcoin cash you
[22:24] know trying to scale the base layer
[22:26] which is we both know that's not a good
[22:28] idea idea I mean we want to keep Bitcoin
[22:30] as as um decentralized as possible which
[22:34] means you know the base layer is slow
[22:37] and and uh
[22:40] expensive then like the the most pure
[22:43] layer to uh in terms of like um actual
[22:48] decentralization and sensorship
[22:49] resistance would be
[22:51] lightning um
[22:53] but what we run into with lightning is
[22:56] well like we it's it's impossible to
[22:58] well not completely impossible but it's
[23:00] very difficult um to scale in in a
[23:03] non-custodial matter which is the only
[23:05] matter matter that matters because if if
[23:07] we don't care about the the
[23:09] non-custodial part then we can just
[23:11] scale through coinbase we can just scale
[23:12] through binance we can just scale
[23:14] through whichever exchange we want like
[23:16] if if if the U if the custody of the
[23:19] funds doesn't matter then then scaling
[23:22] is no issue but if the custody of the
[23:24] funds do matter uh then lightning is is
[23:29] not what can scale Bitcoin to hundreds
[23:32] of millions or billions of users in a
[23:34] non-custodial manner um if we want to
[23:38] scale it in a non-custodial manner we we
[23:40] need lightning to function more or
[23:44] actually let's let's first attack the
[23:45] the term non-custodial like um we all
[23:49] agree that Bitcoin is non-custodial
[23:50] right like bit the Bitcoin base layer is
[23:53] non-custodial if you have your own keys
[23:55] on the Bitcoin Bitcoin Network it's
[23:57] non-custodial
[23:58] but like a interesting philosophical
[24:00] question would be like when when did
[24:02] Bitcoin actually become non-custodial
[24:04] like when there was one node and Satoshi
[24:08] was the only node was Bitcoin
[24:10] noncustodial then well I would I would
[24:12] say no it was a it was running on one
[24:15] node when it had 10 nodes was it
[24:17] non-custodial 20 50 100 like at what
[24:20] number of nodes did Bitcoin actually
[24:23] become decentralized enough so that we
[24:25] could call it non-custodial
[24:28] right
[24:29] it's I personally think it's an
[24:31] interesting philosophical question and I
[24:32] I don't have the answer to that um but
[24:36] the same could be thought with with like
[24:38] federations mints these type of uh sort
[24:42] of a bit definitely more centralized
[24:44] like no no question about that but if
[24:47] you have for example something like
[24:49] liquid a federation that's run by
[24:51] multiple multiple different entities we
[24:55] we can definitely agree agree that it's
[24:57] more decentral Iz than wallet of Satoshi
[25:00] like there's no question about that it's
[25:02] it's many times more more
[25:05] decentralized um then then also like the
[25:08] the decentralization of lightning like
[25:10] lightning is a two out of two multi you
[25:13] have two parties involved in that like
[25:16] how how decentralized is that like you
[25:19] can say yes lightning lightning is a
[25:21] protocol like it's
[25:24] um it's you you actually have custody of
[25:27] your own own Bitcoin on the base Bas
[25:30] layer if you have a lightning Channel
[25:32] open to someone but it's kind of like
[25:35] your your lightning node that has to be
[25:36] online at all times is still like a
[25:38] single point of failure so I mean you
[25:40] could say it's actually not that
[25:43] decentralized
[25:44] because kind of all your eggs are in one
[25:48] basket so that's that's why I think the
[25:51] the future of this will
[25:53] be
[25:55] um probably initially multi
[25:58] multiple no sorry initially initially a
[26:01] few big federations that will sort of
[26:03] Splinter into multiple different
[26:05] federations that are connected by
[26:06] lightning channels and this is this is
[26:09] sort of how it scales it it could also
[26:12] be that there is sort of one Federation
[26:15] that uh that comes to
[26:19] rule which could be good or bad
[26:22] depending on
[26:24] how how it happens like something I've
[26:28] personally been uh thinking of for a
[26:30] long time now is is um think of a
[26:36] federation between Hardware wallet
[26:39] manufacturers where Hardware wallet
[26:41] manufacturers maintain the Federation
[26:43] and allow zero fee transactions to their
[26:47] customers within the Federation like
[26:50] think a federation maintain but for
[26:52] example Zelo treaser cold coin kite cold
[26:55] card uh Foundation bit box like
[27:00] the the most security conscious
[27:04] um companies that that you
[27:07] already you know use to store your
[27:10] Bitcoin what what if these organizations
[27:12] were to run a
[27:13] federation um and obviously like a
[27:17] federation
[27:19] has has to have a a business model
[27:22] somehow like you need to make money um
[27:25] usually it's with transaction fees
[27:28] because like hot wallets Bitcoin wallets
[27:31] that you that you download on your
[27:34] phone these companies make the software
[27:37] for you to download for free and uh then
[27:40] they charge transaction fees but let's
[27:42] take W of Satoshi for example uh you pay
[27:45] 1% fees when you're sending Bitcoin in
[27:48] and out so if if you make the average
[27:52] American salary in Bitcoin and and you
[27:54] get paid to wallet of Satoshi you you
[27:57] pay 50 bucks
[27:58] $50 a month in fees to wallet of
[28:02] Satoshi so what if what if there was a
[28:05] federation that that didn't need to
[28:08] charge fees because
[28:10] the the maintainers of the of the
[28:12] Federation or this payment
[28:14] Network had another business model like
[28:18] bitcoiners want a hardware wallet anyway
[28:21] why not uh have like a hardware wallet
[28:24] that also gives you free transactions I
[28:28] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[28:31] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[28:34] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[28:37] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[28:39] vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch
[28:43] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[28:46] go out there and show that you are a
[28:48] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[28:51] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[28:54] dropped a completely new and amazing
[28:57] Genesis edition of their watch
[28:59] collections you have the date of the
[29:02] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[29:05] and of course also the block height and
[29:08] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[29:11] the level of detail they put in in this
[29:14] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[29:16] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[29:19] down in the descriptions I love those
[29:22] watches so so much if you watch or
[29:25] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[29:27] I guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[29:30] and now the most important step is to
[29:33] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[29:36] hardware wallet my personal
[29:37] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[29:39] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[29:42] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[29:44] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[29:47] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[29:51] with the code Robin at the checkout
[29:53] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[29:57] your bit bitbox and the next step is to
[29:59] really level up your sovereignty as an
[30:02] individual you have to have the most
[30:04] secure self- custody setup you have to
[30:07] secure your own devices you have to
[30:10] protect your privacy you have to set up
[30:12] an inheritance plan and depending on
[30:15] where you live you even want to have a
[30:17] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[30:20] in case something goes really really
[30:22] wrong and through all those steps the
[30:24] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[30:27] by step app and if you visit the Bitcoin
[30:29] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[30:33] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[30:36] how you can level up your sovereignty
[30:39] yeah and the
[30:40] ecosystem is is interesting because like
[30:43] if if within the Federation you already
[30:46] bought in with the hardware wallet um
[30:48] and maybe other services connected to
[30:50] that one interesting question that you
[30:52] actually brought up the the the point of
[30:55] how do I phrase it when the Bitcoin get
[30:59] decentralized like that's the question
[31:01] of like that that which is very
[31:04] interesting because it was not
[31:07] decentralized at the beginning um when
[31:10] when when zosi first ran it someone
[31:12] could attack it very easily just like
[31:15] smash that computer I mean apparent the
[31:17] code would still be there maybe someone
[31:19] else would would have picked it up but
[31:21] maybe not um so I think the the the most
[31:26] interesting point I I always look at is
[31:29] 2017 with the block size War uh I think
[31:32] that was the most vulnerable uh at a
[31:36] largest scale Bitcoin was ever because
[31:39] it had an attack from within not an
[31:42] outside party but like someone within
[31:46] the ecosystem and a lot of miners like I
[31:48] think the majority of like 90% or so of
[31:50] the miners were there like popular uh
[31:53] speakers in the in this sphere like and
[31:56] then in the beginning actually looked
[31:58] like uh Bitcoin cash is winning like
[32:00] even with the free market like Bitcoin
[32:02] cash went up in in in in the beginning
[32:04] and it was a really a roller coaster um
[32:08] uh I I was not in the the in in in the
[32:11] space back then but I looked at the
[32:13] charts and like if you here and and you
[32:16] get like the miners are on this side and
[32:18] the speakers are on this side like I
[32:20] think it's easy to just follow that one
[32:22] crowd uh without thinking too much about
[32:25] it so 2017 in the block size war is for
[32:29] me one of the proof points how resilient
[32:34] and how great and how decentralized that
[32:36] Bitcoin Community is and from that
[32:39] moment onward for me it was
[32:42] undestroyable for me that that's that's
[32:44] one point that I look at you can
[32:47] probably choose like 100 points before
[32:49] that but that's like the the last point
[32:52] when like okay this is this is a major
[32:54] attack that it survived yeah there were
[32:56] like attacks uh made on bitcoin there's
[33:00] like every day some kind of attack
[33:02] against Bitcoin launched but nothing
[33:05] that really frightened would would
[33:08] frighten me but 2017 if I would be with
[33:11] all my money in Bitcoin that's a
[33:13] frightening moment when when you when
[33:15] you are like oh like what's what's going
[33:17] to the Future be like like where should
[33:19] I put my a like that's a hard point to
[33:22] be in like not only if you run a note
[33:24] but also if if you have just Bitcoin on
[33:27] on your balance like just Bitcoin on
[33:29] your as your money uh that's a it's
[33:33] interesting were you already around in
[33:35] at that era I don't I don't know I was I
[33:39] was spending Bitcoin back then I wasn't
[33:42] uh I wasn't uh saving in Bitcoin I was
[33:46] intrigued about a new digital currency
[33:48] and I was uh using it on not this not
[33:51] the smartest
[33:53] purchases uh I we just leave it at that
[33:56] but uh
[33:59] yeah um I hadn't I hadn't understood the
[34:03] uh the true uh promise of Bitcoin back
[34:06] then interesting first using it as a
[34:09] mean of exchange and afterwards yeah I
[34:12] mean I mean kind of you could kind of
[34:14] say that I had understood the the sort
[34:15] of final final promise of Bitcoin like
[34:18] censorship resistant money uh but uh I
[34:21] hadn't understood the the store value
[34:23] part yet I wasn't uh actively saving in
[34:27] bit
[34:28] Bitcoin um but yeah it's it's it's
[34:31] definitely very interesting to see if
[34:34] we'll have a moment like that again um
[34:38] personally I I I think we won't most
[34:42] likely um I don't think there will be
[34:45] any massive attacks on
[34:47] bitcoin uh I I
[34:50] think there could I mean I'm not saying
[34:52] there couldn't be I'm I'm definitely
[34:54] it's definitely not a
[34:56] 0% uh chance scenario that there that
[34:59] there will be like I'm I'm I'm not yet
[35:03] completely sold even though I was hyping
[35:05] up the institutional adoption part and
[35:08] and you know the the big uh big
[35:10] traditional money coming in earlier but
[35:13] I mean there is there is definitely a
[35:15] risk in that too and bitcoiners need to
[35:19] need to be
[35:20] vigilant in case I mean I don't have to
[35:23] say this because bitcoiners are Vigilant
[35:25] and
[35:26] bitcoiners do understand do understand
[35:29] but I mean
[35:31] the it's it's really like obviously
[35:34] obviously if there's a Bitcoin
[35:36] Fork
[35:38] um you know one one side of the fork
[35:41] gets gets dumped and the other other
[35:43] side of the fork gets bought and and
[35:46] that's sort of which one gets dumped and
[35:49] which one gets bought and in which sort
[35:51] of ratios kind of at least in the short
[35:55] term determines the winner um so that's
[35:59] that's definitely why why institutions
[36:02] coming into the space could be uh could
[36:05] be risky I mean obviously if Black Rock
[36:07] were to were to um support some some
[36:11] fork
[36:13] and I don't I don't think so but I mean
[36:16] uh it's it's not impossible that that
[36:19] Michael sailor would be on that uh that
[36:21] train too uh they could cause cause a
[36:24] lot of selling pressure on on the sort
[36:27] of real Bitcoin and and try to try to
[36:31] drive up a fork like that but I'm
[36:34] personally not worried really really
[36:36] worried about those types of things I I
[36:38] I agree with you that Bitcoin Bitcoin
[36:41] has shown enough resilience already to
[36:44] to be able to withstand basically
[36:48] anything yeah and and it's like um if
[36:52] like Black Rock and Michael sa actually
[36:55] and I I don't see that happening uh
[36:57] especially not with Michael saor
[36:59] but that makes it even more dangerous
[37:02] because you cannot imagine it so like if
[37:04] it's actually happening it's it's kind
[37:05] of like maybe maybe there has something
[37:07] to it um so it makes it even more
[37:11] dangerous in that case uh but it's uh
[37:16] it's more of like uh at that point I
[37:19] think it's the risks are only medium
[37:22] term the risks are only like short and
[37:24] medium term and nothing really long term
[37:27] because all the the the things that that
[37:30] would happen from that is that um you
[37:33] have an huge opportunity cost and so
[37:36] like if you think about that like what
[37:38] incentive the sailor has to um go for
[37:44] some Fork that would shepardize the
[37:47] security of Bitcoin like like what what
[37:51] would his kind of incentive or his his
[37:54] his structure be for for doing that
[37:58] he's a more of the like hey let's let's
[38:00] keep Bitcoin exactly like is I think he
[38:02] is against like almost all changes that
[38:04] come to the Bas layer and he's very
[38:06] vocal about that like the horific and
[38:08] stuff like that uh maybe even too much
[38:11] uh but but like it would be very hard
[38:15] for for him to make the switch to say
[38:17] like oh like we we don't need any
[38:19] exchanges but that one small like we we
[38:22] have to it would be weird to to have
[38:24] like an interview like that so I cannot
[38:26] imagine it but the this the the point
[38:29] still stand like that there can be an
[38:31] attack of like black rock with a lot of
[38:33] money buying out influencers and
[38:37] whatever uh which is also hard because
[38:39] of like I think Bitcoin content creators
[38:43] are the hardest to buy out I'm not
[38:45] saying they're completely resistant to
[38:47] that um but I think they are the most
[38:51] principled people probably in in the
[38:53] whole content creator space of like yeah
[38:56] you throw money at the content creat he
[38:57] says what what you will do and
[38:59] bitcoiners are kind of like oh like why
[39:02] why would you like that like I don't
[39:04] care like I I have I have Fu money like
[39:08] like yes I can have more Fu money but
[39:10] like why should I support that so uh
[39:13] they they're more resilient to that uh
[39:15] completely not completely immune but uh
[39:18] it's I I just cannot imagine any attacks
[39:22] now on bitcoin outside of like alien
[39:26] invasions and stuff that like like you
[39:28] you can go to Crazy places of like yeah
[39:30] like in that case probably Bitcoin fails
[39:32] but nothing else matters then also uh so
[39:36] outside of those things and even in an
[39:39] alien invasion um I think Bitcoin has a
[39:43] high the highest likelihood of still
[39:46] having value in kind of a new world um
[39:51] uh uh besides uh the the other things
[39:54] because like I don't know I don't I
[39:57] don't think alien will be interested in
[39:58] Gold uh not more as an industrial medal
[40:01] and stuff like that uh so you really
[40:04] have to go very far down the conspiracy
[40:07] theory uh thinking of like what could
[40:11] happen to bitcoin which kind of pro the
[40:13] resilience of of and then it's also
[40:16] super interesting U when I talk to uh
[40:19] normal people it's like oh I'm worried
[40:22] about uh the quantum computers and then
[40:25] they store all their money in euros and
[40:28] I'm like you you're aware that you're
[40:32] aware that any bank account is not even
[40:37] not even a little bit as secure as any
[40:40] uh Bitcoin wallet so I feel like the new
[40:43] thing always has to prove on all the
[40:46] areas before someone can can adopt it
[40:49] and the old thing the uh the the thing
[40:52] that they're currently using they're
[40:53] just letting as a give so that there
[40:56] needs to be like 10x or like a 100x
[40:58] development for someone of like
[41:01] Improvement to your their life to
[41:03] actually jump over to the new technology
[41:06] which is kind of
[41:07] frustrating what kind of questions you
[41:09] get like oh Bitcoin like can it not be
[41:12] banned like of course but like your Euro
[41:15] can be banned tomorrow like it it
[41:18] literally can be non-existing tomorrow
[41:21] if if the Central Bank decides like that
[41:23] and it can be devalued to more 50% if
[41:26] the Central Bank decides like they're
[41:27] like are you not worried about that uh
[41:30] so uh that that that's super interesting
[41:34] I'm also curious what you think of what
[41:37] influences the speed of the adoption
[41:40] most there is it um is it the
[41:44] institutional and and people buying or
[41:46] is it also the
[41:48] technical ease of use uh and and just
[41:52] like the the aspect of Bitcoin being so
[41:55] much better in for example
[41:57] uh sending money abroad or like having a
[42:00] bank account and and and doing those
[42:03] kind of things uh is it is it the
[42:06] Bitcoin is so much better as a network
[42:08] and an asset uh or is it more of like
[42:11] okay like there's this influence that
[42:13] there like hey Bitcoin is good and all
[42:15] of a sudden people people jump in yeah I
[42:18] I I personally think
[42:20] it's it's definitely still mainly driven
[42:25] by by the uh
[42:27] number go up by by the interest in in
[42:30] the price I I think that will
[42:33] change but but for now I I think it's
[42:35] mainly driven driven by Price most
[42:39] people don't care about the the you know
[42:44] um how would I say societal societal
[42:46] philosophical changes that that Bitcoin
[42:49] brings um they will they will it takes
[42:52] some time and that's that's good it's
[42:55] it's good that uh
[42:58] good that new I mean it depends
[43:00] obviously but mostly it's good that that
[43:02] new ideas take time to to mature uh just
[43:05] takes takes time for people to adopt
[43:07] them um it's it's a
[43:10] good how would I say defense mechanism
[43:12] for Humanity so that we don't adopt some
[43:15] stupid thing that turns out to be like a
[43:18] a complete U complete mistake on our
[43:21] part like for example the media during
[43:26] Co like everyone was so against
[43:30] antivaxers I mean I'm I'm not a medical
[43:33] professional I don't have an opinion on
[43:35] on these things but I think it's like
[43:38] doesn't matter what vaccine we we have
[43:40] like or or what medical procedure or
[43:43] what illness or whatever um or or what
[43:47] new thing we're trying or what new food
[43:49] we're introducing like it's it's very
[43:51] good that Mo like all people don't do it
[43:54] immediately like if we have if we have
[43:56] like new form of candy that you know we
[44:00] we don't really know what's in it we we
[44:02] don't know 100% that it's safe like we
[44:05] don't want every person in the world
[44:06] going to the store and buying it right
[44:08] now because like that's just not smart
[44:11] like if it's if if if there is some
[44:13] poison in that leads to people dying
[44:15] then we just eradicated the human race
[44:17] and uh that wasn't too smart so I I
[44:20] think it's very good that things take
[44:23] take time to uh to mature and and for
[44:26] people to adopt them that being said I
[44:29] do think the time time for Bitcoin is is
[44:32] now and uh yeah I I I think that most
[44:36] important most interesting sort of phase
[44:40] will start when when the majority of
[44:42] people have accepted that Bitcoin is the
[44:44] best form of money and it starts to sort
[44:48] of the discussion starts revolving more
[44:51] around where where are you storing your
[44:54] Bitcoin how what's the best you know
[44:57] payment system for Bitcoin is there like
[44:59] a an accounting accounting system for
[45:02] Bitcoin um what's what's the best way to
[45:04] borrow against your Bitcoin like when
[45:06] when stuff like this starts to uh steal
[45:10] the spotlight from the price that's when
[45:13] I'll personally be very happy but it'll
[45:16] take some time for
[45:17] sure yeah this
[45:21] um most people are
[45:23] very focused on the why
[45:27] and once we get to the how um everyone
[45:31] will have Bitcoin so like once we the
[45:35] once you don't get the question anymore
[45:37] like oh like why should I adop Bitcoin
[45:39] like why is Bitcoin better than gold
[45:40] like why is Bitcoin better than this
[45:42] like why why why why not an altcoin
[45:45] against Bitcoin like why not digital
[45:47] Euro versus Bitcoin like uh and all
[45:50] those why question of like all like like
[45:53] why deflationary systems and and and all
[45:56] those questions once we get that and
[45:59] actually like most of my podcast is
[46:00] focus on the why uh um once we get that
[46:04] out of the way which I think will still
[46:07] take some years um and we only focus on
[46:11] like oh like how actually can can we
[46:13] best do this Bitcoin thing like what
[46:15] what is the best
[46:16] custo how can I best spend it on a daily
[46:19] basis um where this is the the the thing
[46:22] that I'm actually now coming towards
[46:24] where I'm like okay I'm earning most of
[46:27] my income not in Bitcoin all of my
[46:30] financial energy is in Bitcoin um and
[46:35] I'm also now starting to uh spend in
[46:39] Bitcoin and I'm really thinking of like
[46:41] okay what applications can I use like
[46:43] what is the the best workflow for for
[46:45] Bitcoin which is totally different thing
[46:47] of like understanding Bitcoin and
[46:50] understanding how to use Bitcoin uh that
[46:52] that was a super I had with Ben from BTC
[46:55] sessions uh like like a week ago or
[46:58] something like that or two weeks ago a
[47:00] podcast and it was interesting because
[47:03] he said like he he's not he's now not
[47:05] focusing on on the why uh he's just like
[47:09] um counting on other Bitcoin content
[47:12] creators and Educators to explain the
[47:14] why really good like Michael saor S Mo
[47:16] and all the other the people um and then
[47:20] taking the bit coiners down the how
[47:23] Journey like okay what hard wallets are
[47:26] there how can you do it you take Soul
[47:28] management like all those things you can
[47:30] go down a very deep rabbit hole and you
[47:32] can probably make content for the next
[47:34] 50 years or maybe maybe not that long
[47:37] actually maybe it's like 20 years let's
[47:39] see how how fast the Bitcoin adoption is
[47:42] going um which is super interesting uh
[47:45] because the how is is kind of um after
[47:48] after the W how first how F do you think
[47:51] this will all go there are many
[47:53] different theories of like esur or like
[47:55] diminishing returns like many like n
[47:59] name your favorite model uh but um what
[48:03] is your your kind of theory of like how
[48:05] adoption will happen over the next uh
[48:08] couple of years or decades I'm I'm a
[48:10] Believer in in gradually then suddenly
[48:12] that you could call that scurve maybe
[48:15] but I I do think there will be a time
[48:18] when when uh people will start sort of
[48:23] rapidly rapidly running towards Bitcoin
[48:27] like that that time will come it I I
[48:29] don't think it's it's right here around
[48:32] the corner I don't think it's going to
[48:33] happen next year I don't think it's
[48:35] going to happen probably probably
[48:37] probably not this decade either I could
[48:39] be wrong on that but
[48:41] um yeah I I do think there will there
[48:44] will be a time where where people people
[48:47] really start start uh adopting Bitcoin
[48:51] in in like the the hundreds of
[48:55] millions uh even even
[48:57] billions but yeah like like Ben I'm I'm
[49:02] I'm much more interested in the uh the
[49:05] how nowadays and um yeah like like like
[49:09] you mentioned Michael sailor in alific I
[49:12] mean I I I agree that Bitcoin the base
[49:17] layer should be uh should be sort of uh
[49:21] slow moving uh shouldn't shouldn't
[49:24] change rapidly I mean the innovation
[49:27] should happen on on the layer
[49:30] 2os like I said I think probably
[49:33] something like federations or or mints
[49:35] will be the the final um sort of user
[49:40] facing application or or entity but uh
[49:44] yeah I'm I'm I'm personally very very
[49:47] interested to see how how far will take
[49:52] alific because we I mean we we can all
[49:55] agree that that Bitcoin can't stay
[49:58] exactly like it is now forever like
[50:00] that's that's something we all agree on
[50:03] WE Bitcoin will have to implement some
[50:06] um some advancements in the future
[50:10] um which which advancements those are we
[50:13] we we won't know until they get
[50:14] implemented until we we have broad
[50:16] consensus on them um but I definitely
[50:20] think there are some some important ones
[50:25] uh maybe not not directly around the
[50:28] corner like with with uh Mass adoption
[50:31] but uh but definitely the you know you
[50:34] can see them see them in the Horizon um
[50:37] one one interesting thing I've been
[50:39] thinking a lot about recently is uh is
[50:43] like utxo owner ownership like actually
[50:46] owning onchain Bitcoin because like I
[50:49] said it's it's yeah if if if we uh if we
[50:52] are okay with with centralized custodial
[50:55] models we can we don't need to do
[50:57] anything we we already have everything
[50:58] we need for Mass Bitcoin adoption but if
[51:01] we want um if we want sort of self-
[51:05] sovereign uh Bitcoin
[51:07] ownership um to be Mass adopted then
[51:10] then there are some some changes that
[51:13] will need to happen to the
[51:15] protocol um
[51:17] and when these changes will happen um I
[51:21] don't know I don't know if they will
[51:23] happen I know some changes will happen
[51:26] uh and I think I think these are changes
[51:30] that that will happen but uh some
[51:33] something like uh you know Co
[51:36] covenants um allowing allowing sort of
[51:40] multiple people to own a utxo in a self-
[51:44] sovereign manner that could be very
[51:46] interesting um I I I speak to a lot of
[51:48] people
[51:49] about me believing that in in some
[51:54] decades um during our life time
[51:57] definitely but but in probably in some
[51:59] decades I I think most people if not all
[52:02] will be able to to hold on chain Bitcoin
[52:07] I think it just it just makes sense uh
[52:10] it just makes sense to achieve that or
[52:13] to strive for that
[52:16] and it it's kind of counterintuitive if
[52:19] you if you study the protocol today but
[52:24] I do think there is there is a lot
[52:27] of yeah a lot a lot more scalability on
[52:30] the base layer that can be achieved
[52:31] without making sacrifices to
[52:34] decentralization to security yeah mainly
[52:37] mainly around bundling transactions I
[52:40] mean with with Covenant you could have
[52:42] with Covenant and and something like
[52:44] aggregated schnor signatures you could
[52:46] have you know M millions of people own a
[52:51] part of a utxo and and with with stuff
[52:54] like uh coin joint and federations and
[52:57] and like I said again aggregated schnor
[52:59] signatures you could have uh Bitcoin
[53:02] transactions
[53:03] that that sort of um yeah that that that
[53:07] uh millions of people could could
[53:09] participate in one one single onchain
[53:12] transaction as sovereigns like they
[53:15] actually control their their part of the
[53:17] utxo and without their signature their
[53:19] funds don't move and and uh I I I think
[53:24] it will be achieved uh the reason why I
[53:26] think there isn't such a big uh um rush
[53:30] to get it done is because obviously
[53:32] every change needs to be rigorously
[53:34] tested it needs to be
[53:36] rigorously um
[53:39] yeah battle tested uh but but I think a
[53:44] lot of these tests are underway now and
[53:48] I think there will be some very
[53:49] interesting very interesting uh
[53:51] developments in the
[53:53] future yeah and also like one reason
[53:55] currently the um transaction fee on the
[53:58] base layer is really not that high also
[54:01] currently uh so um I I think more it's
[54:06] the same if like for people that come
[54:09] from Fear system to bitcoin the pain
[54:11] Point has to be higher uh if if people
[54:13] all of the sudden have to pay instead of
[54:16] let's say $5 or maybe like $1 for a
[54:19] transaction um and all of the sudden
[54:21] they have to pay $100 for transaction or
[54:23] like $200 for transaction those
[54:26] developments one on Layer Two but also
[54:30] um like what I he like what I hear from
[54:33] you is like shared UT takes UT takes s
[54:35] basically um those developments with
[54:37] governance will be coming way way
[54:41] quicker uh and and have a
[54:44] more a bigger focus and it's very
[54:48] important as you said that we talk about
[54:51] them a long time that we test them a
[54:53] long time and then we Implement them
[54:55] with with care um but you still think
[54:58] that uh it's it's currently a good
[55:00] practice to do uto management of like
[55:04] clearing out some dust and consolidating
[55:06] your utos even though there might come
[55:10] improvements down the road yeah
[55:12] definitely it's it's uh it's definitely
[55:15] good to uh not have dust laying
[55:19] around uh just people who yeah go ahead
[55:24] uh I want to ju just ask ask you what is
[55:26] your magical number of like what's your
[55:29] limit of like is it 500,000 or like a
[55:32] million SS or like yeah five 500 to a
[55:34] million some somewhere in that space and
[55:36] just for for people who who might not
[55:38] know what what we're referring to with
[55:40] dust is you know obviously transactions
[55:43] on the Bitcoin Bitcoin base layer the
[55:46] Bitcoin blockchain or or layer one these
[55:48] are all ways it's referred to but uh
[55:51] transactions there are are costly costly
[55:54] is obviously relative but but if if you
[55:56] have a utxo which is basically just like
[56:00] a fraction of a a Bitcoin it's a it's
[56:03] it's kind of like a a single balance you
[56:06] can think of them like coins and and uh
[56:09] and uh bills like one utxo would be one
[56:13] coin or one bill um like one one
[56:17] um like one uh part of Bitcoin that you
[56:21] own but if these utxos are too small um
[56:26] then then they might like they might
[56:28] basically be worthless because they're
[56:30] uh they're worth as much as the
[56:32] transaction fee would be for example
[56:34] like if you if you go to a store and you
[56:37] want to pay cash but there's a there's a
[56:39] $1 fee to pay with cash you probably are
[56:43] not going to buy something for $1 at
[56:46] that place because the fee to pay with
[56:48] the dollar is as much as the you know so
[56:52] uh this is this is
[56:54] why why uh utxo management is important
[56:57] that that we have utxos that are large
[57:00] enough that we'll be able to spend them
[57:02] in the future even though uh fees will
[57:07] go
[57:07] up yeah it's a little bit like I I I
[57:10] like to to try to make to do the gold
[57:14] comparisons and um for me it's like if
[57:19] you have uh a a a small bar of gold in
[57:23] in in your in your treasure laying
[57:25] around around uh and you have to spend
[57:28] more money to open that treasure you
[57:31] probably won't do it because you you
[57:33] would it would be a zero some uh game or
[57:35] like maybe even like a loss and I just
[57:37] want to show that to people because like
[57:39] I do but very rarely produce howto
[57:43] videos but always with guests and I did
[57:45] it with one of the the best people I
[57:48] think to speak to with you take so manag
[57:50] man is vicked uh he does so much around
[57:53] that space I think I don't know I I
[57:55] don't see him
[57:56] uh recently that much on on Twitter but
[57:59] his knowledge is really cool uh and nine
[58:02] months ago actually I made um for me
[58:06] kind of like a master class to send to
[58:08] people uh when they want to learn about
[58:10] uto management and dust but also we
[58:13] covered the the the Privacy area also of
[58:15] like um you want to consolidate them but
[58:19] maybe you don't want to mix Stacks
[58:21] together where maybe one is from KC and
[58:24] one is from non KC uh um so also the the
[58:27] privacy in mind uh it's really
[58:30] interesting and uh believe it or not one
[58:34] 1 hour and 10 minutes it's long and we
[58:37] covered the basics of that so you can go
[58:40] deeper but like if you want to learn
[58:43] about uto management I think that's a
[58:45] that's a great great video to to start
[58:47] with at least uh and and Wicket has an
[58:50] amazing way of explaining it and this
[58:53] was actually one of the videos where I
[58:55] also got it explained a little bit uh
[58:57] because I didn't knew about UD own
[58:59] management even a little bit when I
[59:01] started the podcast uh I thought I know
[59:04] Bitcoin quite good but actually didn't
[59:07] know anything about Bitcoin before I
[59:09] started the podcast uh which is uh yeah
[59:12] funny thing um one thing I want to get
[59:15] into also is you mentioned the societal
[59:18] impact that Bitcoin will have and that's
[59:20] like when we think about that concept
[59:22] that we talking about like first we have
[59:23] to get like why Bitcoin then how Bitcoin
[59:26] and then like what's the impact of
[59:29] Bitcoin like on down the road once we
[59:31] get all everyone on boarded and everyone
[59:34] has figured it out the how and we have
[59:36] all the companies and services in place
[59:38] what do you think is the the the impact
[59:41] that Bitcoin uh will will have on our
[59:44] world I think it's going to be immensely
[59:46] positive like I think Bitcoin
[59:49] is is probably probably going to be the
[59:52] most most positive thing we've seen I
[59:55] don't know since
[59:57] well at least in the last 3 to 500 years
[60:01] for sure before that there there might
[60:04] have been some uh some uh very important
[60:08] um very important inventions that that
[60:12] might have had like you could argue had
[60:13] a bigger societal impact but definitely
[60:16] the biggest of our time uh definitely
[60:20] the biggest of the last century I would
[60:22] say um but I think the main thing that
[60:26] Bitcoin will
[60:28] change is probably how how people
[60:32] view you know economics and the states
[60:36] mostly like currently currently our our
[60:41] understanding or the general
[60:42] understanding of of how a how a persons
[60:47] or companies or or a
[60:50] countries economy should be handled is
[60:52] is so detached from reality like we
[60:56] we our mental models are so broken that
[60:59] that we can't measure like basic stuff
[61:02] that's going on like we can't we can't
[61:05] we can't even agree on on fundamental
[61:08] truths in like our society we We can't
[61:12] agree whether we're going in the right
[61:14] direction or wrong
[61:16] direction uh because the numbers that
[61:19] are supposed to tell us that are
[61:22] manipulated and and they they are not
[61:25] they're not the real
[61:26] numbers so I think that is that is what
[61:30] Bitcoin
[61:32] will have the biggest impact on it it'll
[61:35] it'll it'll function as a type of
[61:37] compass
[61:39] like it'll it'll guide us in the right
[61:42] direction uh it'll guide us to the right
[61:45] policies it'll guide us to to the right
[61:49] decisions on a societal level because
[61:51] it's it's the first form of money that
[61:53] actually allows us to measure the
[61:56] economy in a truthful way and and and
[61:58] measure the impact of different policies
[62:01] in a truthful way and measure the impact
[62:03] of Taxation measure the impact of of
[62:07] laws regulations and and and also allow
[62:09] us to
[62:10] compare uh different
[62:12] leaders you know in a in a in a much
[62:15] better way like I I'll give you an
[62:17] example like the we we can have two
[62:21] presidents or or two leaders of a
[62:23] country whatever we decide to call them
[62:24] presidents or dictators I mean these
[62:26] words are thrown around nowadays uh but
[62:29] uh yeah we we could have two presidents
[62:32] where where one one you know decides to
[62:36] lower
[62:38] taxes because they're actually cutting
[62:41] government and because they're actually
[62:43] you know giving the free market more
[62:48] room
[62:49] to
[62:50] express itself like basically giving
[62:53] people more room to express their need
[62:55] needs and allow the free market to to
[62:59] drive down prices in the things that
[63:01] people need or you could have a
[63:03] president that uh that sort of
[63:06] subsidizes uh low taxation with with
[63:09] money
[63:10] Printing and yeah
[63:14] basically fools everyone into thinking
[63:16] things are much much better than they
[63:18] are um with with Fiat this happens all
[63:22] the time this happens everywhere uh but
[63:25] with Bitcoin we'll we'll we'll see from
[63:28] Miles Away who who's the good guy and
[63:30] who's the bad guy and who's who's who
[63:32] sort of has our best interests at heart
[63:34] and who is a fraud so that that sort
[63:40] of you know uh honesty that Bitcoin
[63:43] brings to the table is is
[63:45] something I think will have the biggest
[63:47] impact I love that the the the impact of
[63:50] like the integrity and the truth and the
[63:53] um non-manipulated base numb space
[63:55] basally um I'm curious what what what
[63:58] impact did Bitcoin had
[64:01] on on maybe on your business uh you have
[64:05] celu uh and and what what would it what
[64:09] would be uh uh your business without
[64:12] Bitcoin obviously you have a Bitcoin
[64:14] product so it's it's kind of hard to
[64:15] compare but uh is there some insights or
[64:18] some experience that you had that like
[64:20] this is
[64:22] something where the company really
[64:24] benefited from from from having Bitcoin
[64:27] yeah I I think what Bitcoin has given me
[64:29] most most of all is like actual meaning
[64:31] like feel feeling like I'm doing
[64:33] something that really or feeling that
[64:36] I'm at least promoting something even if
[64:39] even if nothing we do works out in the
[64:41] end I I'll still have a feeling of every
[64:44] every single thing we
[64:46] did was well worth it because it uh it
[64:50] was advancing Bitcoin like I'll give you
[64:51] an example actually just happened to
[64:53] have our first product here we before
[64:55] made anything related to bitcoin we made
[64:57] these uh Wireless magnetic power Banks
[65:01] actually the first in the world who made
[65:03] these before Apple too uh but we we sort
[65:07] of came into this Tech first like we
[65:08] wanted to do something cool in the tech
[65:10] space and this is this is what we came
[65:12] up with uh but uh with with Bitcoin it
[65:16] sort of opened new doors and and it gave
[65:19] us sort of a
[65:21] bigger uh
[65:24] bigger sort of problem to fight against
[65:28] like when I started down started on my
[65:30] entrepreneurial Journey my thinking was
[65:34] always like there has to be like a real
[65:37] problem I want to solve or real value I
[65:40] want to bring to the table like I don't
[65:42] want to be the 10,000th you know uh
[65:46] print on
[65:47] demand online shop like again nothing
[65:51] against that I have nothing against
[65:52] print on demand stores uh and I have
[65:54] nothing against uh people building
[65:57] businesses in in sort of um more
[66:01] competed markets or or um this sounds a
[66:04] bit harsh but less Innovative uh markets
[66:08] but for me personally I always always
[66:10] felt like if I can't you know bring
[66:13] something unique to the table then I'm
[66:17] not going to come to the table at all
[66:19] and and that's sort of what what
[66:21] Bitcoin um where Bitcoin really helped
[66:25] me with because we we started we started
[66:28] making these and and about 6 months
[66:30] afterwards Apple released the exact same
[66:34] product and that's when when we sort of
[66:37] had this uh this thought of okay now
[66:41] this isn't new or novel anymore like the
[66:45] bigger biggest companies doing this like
[66:49] we don't we're not really bringing
[66:50] anything new to the table anymore like
[66:52] apple has Apple Apple can produce more
[66:55] these Apple can sell more of these Apple
[66:57] can promote this product better
[67:00] so what is sort of what what is sort of
[67:04] something that we could do where we
[67:05] where we don't throw away everything
[67:07] we've done this far but also you know do
[67:11] something new and exciting that that uh
[67:16] yeah where we can actually feel like
[67:17] we're we're doing something new like
[67:20] doing something um doing something
[67:24] uh different
[67:26] and and that's where that's that's sort
[67:28] of what uh what Bitcoin gave us like not
[67:33] not only the the motivation to
[67:35] do do what we do because we
[67:39] uh we believe in something you know
[67:42] deeper uh but also gave us a new new
[67:47] sort of direction for the company in
[67:49] general like you know this is this is an
[67:51] offline
[67:52] device we thought okay what what other
[67:55] types of offline devices do we have like
[67:57] what what offline devices do we carry
[68:00] and the the next logical step was okay
[68:02] well you have a wallet you have
[68:04] keys you maybe have a power bank why why
[68:08] not put them all into one and sort of
[68:12] build build like this offline Hub like a
[68:15] digital master key and that's that's
[68:19] what we're building now with with clavis
[68:21] our Hardware wallets
[68:23] um like basically basically the next
[68:26] iteration of of this like this plus
[68:29] Bitcoin gets you
[68:31] this
[68:32] and uh yeah that's that's I think the
[68:37] the main thing that Bitcoin has has
[68:39] given me and the company sort of new new
[68:43] dreams New Visions new uh new wins in
[68:46] the
[68:47] sale and it's very satisfying if you can
[68:50] work towards a greater goal where even
[68:54] if your compan company dies tomorrow you
[68:57] still know you did something to go in
[69:01] the right direction and you can be proud
[69:03] of that small contribution uh or big
[69:06] contribution that you made to the space
[69:08] and and I think that's something really
[69:10] cool um and obviously I want to keep
[69:13] that podcast running till I'm dying um
[69:15] but even if I stop tomorrow I know uh
[69:18] I've reached uh 50 to 100,000 people
[69:21] every month and and some of them
[69:23] probably orange build uh through me from
[69:25] my guests and and that that just gives
[69:28] me so much joy of like I I did already
[69:31] something contributing to it and I can
[69:34] now build on top of that and and and go
[69:36] move forward um but even if I stop even
[69:39] if for some reason it it stops um even
[69:43] then I know it's it wasn't for
[69:47] nothing and on the other hand if I just
[69:49] sell t-shirts nothing against t-shirts I
[69:52] mean I actually sell in my store
[69:54] t-shirts but that's like a very small
[69:57] thing and and I just do it because
[69:59] YouTube gives me the possibility to do
[70:01] that and by the way thanks for everyone
[70:03] that that that bought a sh because like
[70:05] there's actually around from like I
[70:08] think five to 10 people per month that
[70:10] actually uh buy them and and it's just
[70:12] like those shirts with a Bitcoin thing
[70:14] on because that's all creative things
[70:17] that I have like random t-shirt and
[70:19] sweatshirt with Bitcoin I can down like
[70:22] more creative it will never be on my
[70:24] social store
[70:26] if you if you follow the store don't
[70:28] don't expect anything more than that
[70:30] because I'm I'm not a creative guy there
[70:33] uh but uh then if it falls back it's
[70:37] like you look back like okay what did
[70:39] you actually create and maybe the
[70:41] teachers have some interesting message
[70:43] and and you're still um happy of that
[70:46] like for example Jim shark I think
[70:47] probably is the most famous example for
[70:50] print on demand was really successful
[70:53] they actually like uh actually try to
[70:56] like make a a movement like something
[70:58] with like gyms and getting in shape and
[71:00] stuff like that uh so it's always like
[71:04] what are you working on and if it's just
[71:06] about making money you will burn out uh
[71:09] and you will not power through but if
[71:10] you actually enjoy it you can keep going
[71:13] like it's so funny when when people say
[71:16] like oh like oh how long can you keep
[71:18] this daily Bitcoin pod I'm
[71:20] like as long as I can talk it's really
[71:23] fun and and now with more resources I
[71:26] can actually Outsource the things that I
[71:27] don't enjoy that much like post
[71:28] production stuff like that so I I can
[71:31] keep going for another 10 years another
[71:33] 100 years maybe if the body allows it uh
[71:36] so uh that's that's super interesting
[71:39] and yeah so I think it's great that
[71:40] you're also on the journey um I have one
[71:43] question that I asked each and every one
[71:44] of my guests and the question is what
[71:46] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin H
[71:50] that's a that's a very interesting
[71:52] question that is definitely a very
[71:54] interesting question question yeah and
[71:56] almost all bitcoiners are like oh [ __ ] I
[71:59] was not prepared for
[72:01] that I wasn't prepared for that at all
[72:04] that's that's a very deep
[72:06] question um yeah I mean besides
[72:10] Bitcoin I think it all for me it all all
[72:13] ties back to Bitcoin in in one way or
[72:16] another
[72:18] but at least that I've sort of come to
[72:22] think of these things through Bitcoin
[72:25] but yeah I I I don't want to sound too
[72:28] cliche either you
[72:30] know believe in yourself you know go go
[72:33] after your dream but but I
[72:37] think yeah building a bit on on what I
[72:40] said um just so just a second ago I
[72:45] think you know it's it's surprising how
[72:48] much you can endure if you really really
[72:52] believe in what you do
[72:55] so I guess what what you can learn from
[72:59] me is is probably some endurance like
[73:04] focus is very important focus on the
[73:06] right
[73:08] things but
[73:11] it's the the most important thing is is
[73:14] that you you at least try to find
[73:17] something that that you believe in so
[73:21] much that you you know can stick with it
[73:24] for
[73:26] years you know we've especially if
[73:29] you're building a company or or doing
[73:30] something like
[73:32] that we all see you know these yeah I
[73:35] started a company three months ago and
[73:37] now I've raised hundred trillion
[73:39] gazillion dollars in funding and you
[73:42] know uh we're going to the moon and in a
[73:45] year we'll raise you know another five
[73:47] quadrillion dollars but you know this
[73:50] isn't this isn't most people like this
[73:55] if if you want to start if you want to
[73:57] start doing something and really be good
[73:59] at it you need to do it for years
[74:02] decades most likely so yeah I guess what
[74:06] what you can learn from from me is if
[74:08] you really believe in what you do and
[74:09] and you
[74:10] really uh have the the grit and the
[74:13] endurance to to stick it out then you
[74:16] can you can make something cool and yeah
[74:20] just just choose something that you can
[74:22] really stick with like you can stick
[74:24] within the ups and downs that probably
[74:27] goes for uh relationships as
[74:30] well um
[74:33] but but yeah def definitely in in what
[74:36] you decide to to do with your time stick
[74:39] stick something you you know you can
[74:40] stick with or choose something you know
[74:42] you can stick with it's a very Bitcoin I
[74:45] think low time preference longterm
[74:47] thinking uh and and I love that
[74:51] and it's I think Pro in our
[74:55] uh small Bitcoin bubble probably not as
[74:58] much as in other bubbles but uh actually
[75:02] the device of like oh follow your like
[75:05] do what you read it it sounds cliche but
[75:08] 99% of people still don't do it like and
[75:12] it's really hard like and I have
[75:14] extremely support the family but the the
[75:18] subtle um fears of the people that love
[75:22] you uh when you tell them oh I have an
[75:26] IT security sales job that I really
[75:28] enjoy and that I like and I I I make a
[75:32] good living uh I earn more than than my
[75:35] mother and stuff like that so uh and and
[75:37] this if if it just came into career so I
[75:40] was just like five years in in the
[75:42] company and was 25 years old so I
[75:44] already had some success there and then
[75:46] to tell everyone like oh I have a
[75:48] YouTube channel with 400 subscribers I
[75:50] will do that now full time nobody really
[75:54] was like oh that sounds like an amazing
[75:56] idea like let's do it uh nobody dis
[75:59] encouraged me so I have a really
[76:01] supportive family that always like tries
[76:03] to to get through that but people like
[76:06] the subtle things that you get from um
[76:09] from people are like oh is that really a
[76:11] good idea uh my grandma even had
[76:14] concerns that I'm getting into a cult
[76:16] and and and uh and uh basically someone
[76:20] is uh riing me off so I had to had to
[76:23] come my grandma down but uh she she also
[76:27] I need to explain the internet and all
[76:29] the things to her uh but uh it's super
[76:33] interesting what you go through uh once
[76:35] you take the the little bit not normal
[76:39] route uh but the upside of that the
[76:42] freedom and the the the
[76:45] creative mind that all of the sudden is
[76:48] is possible for yourself like that's
[76:50] that's just amazing like one year in
[76:53] it's it's it's amazing so yeah I think
[76:56] it's a great thing to to to to share
[76:59] here um we have endogene in the podcast
[77:02] where the previous guest is asking a
[77:04] question for the next guest without
[77:05] knowing who the next guest actually is
[77:07] uh and the previous guest asked you what
[77:10] do you think is the biggest
[77:11] misconception people have about Bitcoin
[77:14] and how do you uh personally explain its
[77:17] long-term value to Skeptics yeah I mean
[77:20] this this is a no-brainer for me at
[77:21] least for in in my circles uh
[77:25] the biggest misconception people have
[77:27] about Bitcoin is that it's one of the
[77:29] cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is just
[77:32] one it's okay it was the first but you
[77:35] know uh Nokia used to be bigger than
[77:38] Apple in in phones and now Nokia's dead
[77:40] so that's going to happen to bitcoin or
[77:42] you know Bitcoin is the Myspace and soon
[77:44] we're going to see the the
[77:46] Facebook but yeah people people really
[77:49] need
[77:50] to understand the difference between a
[77:54] commodity and a security like even if
[77:57] you don't agree with the Securities Law
[78:00] like even if you don't agree with uh
[78:02] going after companies because they raise
[78:04] money from the
[78:06] public like even if you even if you're a
[78:08] Libertarian who who doesn't support the
[78:11] SEC or support like uh Regulators like
[78:15] this and whatever country you are in you
[78:18] still need to understand that there is a
[78:20] fundamental difference between a
[78:22] commodity and a security like and assets
[78:25] without an issuer is an asset that you
[78:29] know people actually go get themselves
[78:33] like gold like oil like corn like
[78:39] Bitcoin these are assets that that are
[78:42] available for anyone anyone can go get
[78:46] them as long as they just put in the
[78:48] work of going to get them and that is
[78:51] very different from an
[78:52] asset with an issuer
[78:56] like you know the leadership of Apple
[78:59] issuing new
[79:00] stock that's not them going doing
[79:04] something getting Apple stock and
[79:06] selling it to you that's
[79:08] them just snapping their fingers issuing
[79:13] new Apple stock that's how all the other
[79:17] cryptos work that's not how Bitcoin
[79:20] Works Bitcoin is completely different in
[79:22] that sense and that's why it's neutral
[79:26] censorship resistant
[79:28] money that's
[79:30] not you know it's it's it's not a
[79:34] cryptocurrency it's not you can't even
[79:36] compare it to to these other other coins
[79:40] that's that's I think is is the biggest
[79:42] misconception in Bitcoin right
[79:44] now absolutely that's a great point I'm
[79:47] also always getting frustrated if people
[79:51] uh confuse product and protocols so like
[79:54] they
[79:55] they they confuse the product of
[79:57] Facebook and and Nokia and apple and all
[80:00] those things with the protocol which
[80:03] would be Bitcoin or the tcpip protocol
[80:06] or other protocols um uh it's it's the
[80:09] most Comm it's the most frustrating
[80:12] thing of like you didn't even get to the
[80:15] starting line of educating yourself
[80:17] about Bitcoin because you don't even
[80:18] know what category of thing Bitcoin is
[80:23] so please go read those five things and
[80:26] then come
[80:27] back it's like the sometimes frustrating
[80:31] but we have to be patient and we have to
[80:33] be extremely kind to uh to the normal
[80:37] because I think we have a chance of
[80:39] making that a peaceful Revolution and
[80:41] not an aggressive one and uh I I do
[80:44] think the peaceful and kind way is
[80:46] probably the best way uh to to do this
[80:49] Bitcoin thing yeah thank you so much uh
