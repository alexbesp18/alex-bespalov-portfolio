[00:00] you have to look around you and see how
[00:02] quickly The innovation's Happening El
[00:04] Salvador got involved well it's just one
[00:06] small country and now you've got the
[00:08] biggest economic power in the world
[00:09] starting to have these conversations
[00:11] that adoption cycle is real and it's
[00:13] coming really fast I don't think any of
[00:15] us thought that we would be in the
[00:16] position where the US would be talking
[00:18] about strategic Bitcoin reserves in 2025
[00:21] that was quick you're retiring from
[00:23] doing things you don't want to do
[00:25] anymore you've freed yourself up you've
[00:26] bought back your time and now in your
[00:29] retirement you get to figure out what it
[00:30] is you're actually passionate about a
[00:32] lot of people actually become more
[00:33] successful in retirement you're no
[00:35] longer tied down to a job you didn't
[00:37] really want to have you're spending all
[00:39] your time focusing on trying to get a
[00:40] five or a 10% raise year-over-year on
[00:42] your salary but then eventually you
[00:45] accumulate enough assets on your balance
[00:47] sheet where you go maybe my efforts
[00:49] aren't best spent on 5% of my income
[00:52] maybe 5% is a much more drastic number
[00:55] if I find 5% more return on the value of
[00:58] my balance sheet innovation happening at
[01:00] lightning speeds now if you ignore that
[01:03] you're going to fall behind you're still
[01:05] very much on the front end of the
[01:06] adoption curve today but nobody can
[01:08] promise how long that's going to
[01:09] [Music]
[01:13] last before we start off with M strategy
[01:16] talks maybe uh just to take get your
[01:18] take on uh what's the whole strategic
[01:22] Bitcoin Reserve thing with Trump going
[01:24] to be like uh what's your take on uh on
[01:27] on the USA and Bitcoin currently
[01:30] yeah it's going to be really interesting
[01:31] I think everyone was really optimistic
[01:34] leading into the
[01:35] inauguration and then there was some of
[01:38] the funny business that came out with
[01:39] some of the meme coins that they were
[01:41] launching and I think that soured quite
[01:44] a few people on what they were really
[01:46] expecting I always try to keep my
[01:47] expectations pretty low mostly because I
[01:50] don't think Bitcoin needs any of these
[01:51] things it's a nice to have it's not a
[01:54] musthave but I do think that we will see
[01:57] some type of a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[02:00] whether I think that they really go for
[02:02] it in the early days I'm not as
[02:04] optimistic about that I do I I agree
[02:06] with a lot of people when I think that
[02:08] they'll stop selling the coins that they
[02:10] do have and they'll hold that as kind of
[02:12] an initial foundation for a strategic
[02:14] Reserve but from there I think that it's
[02:16] going to take some time for us to you
[02:19] know get things like the lumus bill to
[02:21] get that to pass and to do the education
[02:23] rounds that are going to be needed for
[02:25] that but this is the first time that
[02:27] we've had a really favorable
[02:28] Administration right whether whatever
[02:31] you think about the meme coins right
[02:32] they're at least participating in the
[02:34] broader digital asset ecosystem so well
[02:37] I I didn't love the move I I can at
[02:39] least acknowledge that it's showing
[02:41] their interest in participation there
[02:43] and because some of their own like that
[02:44] world Liberty fire or whatever they've
[02:46] got because they were buying some form
[02:49] of Bitcoin I know it was wrapped Bitcoin
[02:51] but the fact that they're starting to
[02:53] participate in align their interests
[02:55] with the interests of Bitcoin I see that
[02:56] as a positive long term everyone goes
[02:59] through an education cycle I always say
[03:02] that you know people need to go to all
[03:03] these alternative coins before they
[03:05] really find out that the True Values in
[03:07] Bitcoin and that's really just where you
[03:09] should focus and I'm not immune to that
[03:12] either right I mean my journey started
[03:14] that way too where you're out there in
[03:15] the internet casino gambling with the
[03:17] best of them and you got to get hurt a
[03:20] few times before you figure out maybe uh
[03:22] maybe this isn't something I should
[03:23] participate and if I can articulate the
[03:25] value proposition of one of these very
[03:27] clearly maybe that's the one that's the
[03:30] long-term value proposition that I
[03:31] should stick with and so you do that
[03:33] full circle to bitcoin I don't think for
[03:35] this Administration it's going to be any
[03:37] different I think that they're going to
[03:38] go through this education process
[03:41] they're getting lobbied by all types of
[03:43] parties right just as much as the
[03:45] Bitcoin industry is lobbying them you
[03:48] can be sure that the ethereum and salana
[03:50] and all these guys are talking to them
[03:52] and donating money and so their
[03:55] attention is spread and because of that
[03:57] I think it's going to take a little bit
[03:58] of time for them to work through their
[04:01] priorities and to really get the full
[04:04] understanding of why they should
[04:05] participate in the world's strongest
[04:07] decentralized monetary network and to me
[04:10] ultimately it becomes a strategic
[04:12] imperative to the United States right if
[04:14] there's one thing that's a risk to the
[04:16] US dollar it would be the rest of the
[04:19] world starting to participate in that
[04:21] decentralized network but the us staying
[04:23] behind right it's very easy to get
[04:25] comfortable when your currency is the
[04:27] reserve currency of the world but you
[04:29] have have to look around you and see how
[04:31] quickly the innovation's happening and
[04:33] we very quickly become a digital world
[04:36] we're all connected now and that's not
[04:39] going to be any different with the money
[04:40] right there shouldn't really be any
[04:42] friction in this day and age for me to
[04:45] take value and transmit it over to Japan
[04:48] if I wanted to instantly I shouldn't
[04:49] have to ask anybody if it's my money
[04:52] right so when you see that and now that
[04:54] people have started to get educated on
[04:57] the weaknesses of Fiat currencies and
[05:00] these past five years when the inflation
[05:02] really took off I think people really
[05:04] got a master's level education in what
[05:07] currency debasement and inflation really
[05:09] means for them as an
[05:11] individual and all of these moves are
[05:13] going to start at the ground level and
[05:16] that's with people and people are what
[05:17] make up corporations people are what
[05:19] make up governments so when you start to
[05:21] get that education and you tie it into
[05:24] your own personal life and understand
[05:26] what you're losing all the time by
[05:28] sitting and being comfortable you start
[05:30] to see the value proposition in Bitcoin
[05:32] rather clearly rather quickly when the
[05:34] rest of the world around you is getting
[05:35] more expensive instead of less expensive
[05:37] so I think that education will work its
[05:39] way up the ranks and I do think
[05:41] ultimately it'll land with the United
[05:43] States with a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[05:46] whether it happens right away or a
[05:48] little bit down the line that's a little
[05:50] less clear all that's interesting it's
[05:52] also um the thought just popped in my
[05:55] head like what what is better uh and a
[05:57] government that is cracking down on
[06:00] crypto and really have like the Gary
[06:02] gansler as aspect to it of like let's
[06:05] fight against those cryptocurrencies or
[06:08] a government that is
[06:09] erasing uh Bitcoin but also all the
[06:13] crypto things uh and bringing the the
[06:15]  coinery on a whole new new level
[06:18] with the government it's an interesting
[06:20] question right I mean I'm not quite sure
[06:23] what the right answer is you do you like
[06:25] to see that they're at least embracing
[06:27] the ecosystem you just don't want them
[06:28] to do it in a way that ends up hurting
[06:30] people right the people that are now
[06:32] participating in all of these you know
[06:35] shitcoins that are out there it's people
[06:37] that are desperate a lot of the times
[06:38] right it's either degenerate gamblers
[06:40] right trying to hit that 10,000 x home
[06:43] run or it's people that are viewing this
[06:46] as their way out of their current
[06:47] situation and we've become very
[06:49] shortterm in our focus in society now
[06:52] and I think social media has had a lot
[06:53] to do with that where we think in terms
[06:55] of one week one month right how can I
[06:58] get rich in one week one month no one
[07:00] wants to go well 30 years is is a good
[07:02] enough time frame for me to get wealthy
[07:04] so everyone's looking for the home run
[07:06] but the problem is is that includes a
[07:08] lot of people that are in more desperate
[07:11] situations right the people that have
[07:13] the luxury of thinking about long-term
[07:15] time frames and putting together a
[07:16] financial plan and figuring out what the
[07:18] right asset allocation is for them right
[07:21] that's a luxury for a lot of people most
[07:23] people are in the paycheck to paycheck
[07:25] scenario in the world right now and
[07:27] because of that they're looking for the
[07:28] fast way right well if I get my paycheck
[07:31] and I put it into trumpcoin and I get a
[07:33] 20,000x on it right well then all my
[07:36] problems are solved the problem is
[07:38] nobody ever knows one when to sell right
[07:40] you got to know when things are much too
[07:42] good to be true but two you realize that
[07:45] you're going to lose so often in that
[07:47] scenario that it erodes all the value
[07:50] proposition for you out of it I mean
[07:52] when you look at something like Bitcoin
[07:54] that's returning 60% year-over-year
[07:56] part has to wonder why isn't that enough
[08:00] right in this society when the society
[08:02] used to be conditioned for you know 9 to
[08:04] 12% was a really good annual return now
[08:07] people are saying 60% is not enough you
[08:10] know I need
[08:11] 2,000% you're going well that that's
[08:13] just not real otherwise everyone would
[08:14] be a billionaire so it's that education
[08:17] perspective and I don't like seeing
[08:19] people that are in positions of power
[08:22] putting out these types of coins that
[08:24] you just we've got a lot of history to
[08:26] know that these tend to end poorly so I
[08:29] I try to do what I can to Usher people
[08:32] away from that and go don't get
[08:33] distracted right every time people see
[08:35] anyone else making money they tend to
[08:37] run that direction but usually by that
[08:40] time you're too late right and you don't
[08:42] want to be the late entrance because
[08:43] then your investment erods really
[08:45] quickly so I try to tell people focus on
[08:48] what you know has long-term value and
[08:51] you can see all the evidence of the
[08:53] adoption of it and you don't need to
[08:55] look too broadly beyond that with
[08:57] Bitcoin it was always well everyone
[08:59] would assume we made it when
[09:01] corporations were involved well that
[09:02] happened years ago and then they said
[09:05] well no countries will get involved then
[09:07] El Salvador got involved then they went
[09:09] well it's just one small country and now
[09:12] you've got the biggest economic power in
[09:14] the world starting to have these
[09:16] conversations and when you look at that
[09:18] you go that adoption cycle is real and
[09:21] it's coming really fast right I don't
[09:23] think any of us thought that we would be
[09:25] in the position where the US would be
[09:27] talking about strategic Bitcoin Reserves
[09:29] in 2025 that was quick and if you're
[09:32] paying attention you know that that
[09:35] shows the value proposition that that
[09:37] asset holds and the power that
[09:39] decentralization holds in a monetary
[09:41] Network and so I don't need to look much
[09:44] further than Bitcoin from that
[09:46] perspective right I can see the adoption
[09:48] happening and it's happening way faster
[09:50] than I thought it would so I'm not going
[09:52] to allow myself to get distracted by all
[09:54] these side shows that are happening out
[09:56] here and get myself wrapped up all the
[09:59] altcoin movements again I've been there
[10:01] I've tried those I don't see the value
[10:04] in them right I understand tokenized
[10:06] economies and I think that there is
[10:07] probably a position in the world for
[10:09] tokenizing assets down the line but
[10:11] right now I try to focus on what asset
[10:15] is helping to solve one of the biggest
[10:17] problems that every individual is facing
[10:20] right now which is inflation and
[10:21] debasement of your currency which is
[10:24] going to cause people to be locked into
[10:25] these jobs out of desperation and not
[10:28] necessarily out of a passion for what
[10:30] they're doing so I know what bitcoin's
[10:32] aiming to solve right now I see it as a
[10:35] very strong store of value and I think
[10:37] people will start to see that over time
[10:39] they just have to keep themselves from
[10:40] getting distracted absolutely and it's
[10:43] it's kind of fascinating to see all that
[10:46] happening and remembering like that's an
[10:48] open uh technology everyone can
[10:51] participate in it's decentralized it's
[10:53] globally available uh a strictly capped
[10:56] Supply and an increasing ever increasing
[10:59] uh demand we never had that like we
[11:02] don't know what's happening yeah people
[11:05] don't know what to expect out of this
[11:07] right because they're trying to
[11:08] normalize Bitcoin like every other asset
[11:10] that they've seen in their life the
[11:12] problem is it's not like any other asset
[11:14] that they've seen in their life this is
[11:15] the first one that you're going to see
[11:17] where no matter the increase in demand
[11:19] there's not going to be any more Supply
[11:21] coming to the market and I don't think
[11:23] people can really conceptualize what
[11:25] that means to an asset like Bitcoin when
[11:27] you truly have a fixed Supply you know
[11:30] exactly how many of them are going to
[11:31] get released every day right that type
[11:35] of structure in an asset class is
[11:38] unfamiliar to most of the world and
[11:40] we've never really had a true experiment
[11:44] where we see what happens when unlimited
[11:47] demand meets finite Supply and I think
[11:50] this is going to be the first time we're
[11:51] going to see it and I I don't think
[11:53] people are ready for what that's going
[11:54] to look like I think it's going to shock
[11:56] most people uh on orders of magnitude
[11:58] that they're not prepared prepared for
[12:00] do you think also that this law of
[12:03] diminishing returns is kind of BS of
[12:06] like we we will probably have a big
[12:09] adoption curve in front of us I think we
[12:11] have a very big adoption curve in front
[12:13] of us people are people don't really
[12:15] understand how much money there is in
[12:17] the world right because they look at it
[12:20] in all these different buckets but
[12:21] putting together the full picture of you
[12:23] know all the paper value that's out
[12:25] there as well versus you know actual
[12:27] physical currencies and then you got all
[12:29] the digital currencies because you got
[12:30] fractional Reserve banking right no one
[12:33] really has a full concept of just how
[12:35] much money there is out there micr
[12:37] strategy's been doing a good job
[12:38] educating us because sailor always puts
[12:40] that slide in all of his presentations
[12:42] showing all the different buckets where
[12:44] Bitcoin can extract value out of but
[12:46] when you look at just a bond market with
[12:49] $300 trillion dollars of value in it
[12:51] right that's tough for most people to
[12:53] conceptualize and that's just the bond
[12:55] market right that's not everything
[12:57] beyond that so 's a huge amount of value
[13:00] that can benefit from an asset like
[13:03] Bitcoin and I think that slowly over
[13:06] time when people start to figure out
[13:08] that we do have that adoption curve in
[13:10] front of us I mean keep in mind it's
[13:11] only a$2 trillion dollar asset right
[13:13] it's not a very big asset in the grand
[13:15] scheme of global finance and so when you
[13:18] look at all these other asset classes
[13:20] that are so significantly
[13:22] underperforming Bitcoin and then you
[13:24] start to learn about all the unique
[13:26] characteristics that Bitcoin holds you
[13:29] start to really question why wouldn't I
[13:32] be participating in that asset if I've
[13:34] got all these underperforming corporate
[13:36] bonds or treasuries or whatever you're
[13:38] holding and you realize that you're
[13:40] locked into these low singled digigit
[13:42] returns meanwhile right in front of you
[13:45] with no real barriers to entry you've
[13:47] got the largest decentralized global
[13:50] monetary Network that's getting interest
[13:53] from individuals it's getting interest
[13:56] from Sovereign wealth funds it's getting
[13:57] interest from corporations now it's
[13:59] getting interest from Nations and even
[14:02] the nation with a reserve currency of
[14:04] the world when you see those types of
[14:06] things falling into place it's tough to
[14:09] question or it's tough to come to the
[14:11] conclusion that you shouldn't be
[14:13] participating in that because if
[14:15] everybody else that's controlling
[14:17] capital of the world is seeing value in
[14:19] this asset and is transitioning their
[14:22] value from whatever they're holding over
[14:24] to bitcoin you might want to start
[14:27] paying attention to that because because
[14:29] it's not a tough puzzle to solve to
[14:31] figure out why they're doing that and
[14:34] when every other asset was gaining value
[14:37] largely just because the currency that
[14:39] it's valued in is debasing right that's
[14:41] something a lot of people don't
[14:43] understand is that yes you get things
[14:45] like housing values that are going up
[14:48] but a large part of that is that it's
[14:50] just the dollar is always going down
[14:52] right so it's a denominator that's
[14:54] changing that's giving that Topline
[14:56] value to the asset class and making them
[14:58] look like they're appreciating in value
[15:00] but really it's just your purchasing
[15:01] power eroding before your eyes and once
[15:05] you come to that
[15:07] realization you start looking for
[15:09] Solutions real quick and I think that's
[15:11] one of the great gifts that bitcoin's
[15:13] given to the world right if you looked
[15:14] at nothing else right take away all the
[15:16] other value that bitcoin's providing
[15:18] which is immeasurable at this point one
[15:21] thing it did is it provided people with
[15:23] a new level of financial literacy and
[15:25] financial education until you know
[15:28] probably the last last five six years
[15:31] people really weren't talking about
[15:33] inflation and monetary debasement and
[15:35] they weren't putting together the math
[15:37] of all right I'm taking one of my most
[15:39] finite resources my time and my energy
[15:43] and I'm applying that to a job that I'm
[15:45] working whether I want to be working
[15:47] that job or not I need to because I need
[15:49] the money that it provides so I'm taking
[15:51] my time and my efforts and I'm trading
[15:54] that for the value I'm extracting from
[15:55] my job in terms of my paycheck my salary
[15:58] whatever it might be but the cycle that
[16:00] people get into is all right now once
[16:02] you've got that asset first it devalues
[16:05] on its own right without you doing
[16:07] anything immediately when you get that
[16:09] money it starts devaluing on you but
[16:11] then you go and do things like take that
[16:13] money convert it over I'm going to go
[16:15] buy a new car so now I've taken a huge
[16:17] amount of that money that I earned
[16:19] through my time and efforts and I bought
[16:21] another asset well the problem with that
[16:23] asset is now it depreciates just even
[16:25] faster than inflation does so you get
[16:27] into this Loop right where you're
[16:29] constantly trying to extract value from
[16:31] your efforts but then you're deploying
[16:33] it and people are deploying it in the
[16:34] wrong ways that keep them in that cycle
[16:37] of constantly losing value in their life
[16:39] and it never allows anybody to get ahead
[16:41] I one of the best things that someone
[16:44] could do and I think one of the most
[16:45] freeing experiences people have is when
[16:48] you finally buy your freedom from doing
[16:50] things you don't really want to do and
[16:52] that's most people in their careers
[16:54] which is really sad to think about is
[16:56] that most people fall into careers
[16:59] purely for the reason that they have to
[17:01] and this is what was going to pay me the
[17:03] amount that I wanted right that's how
[17:04] careers tend to move it's really gotten
[17:07] out of what are you passionate about in
[17:09] your life and where do you think you can
[17:10] create the most value and provide the
[17:12] most value to the world it's become
[17:14] these jobs of desperation right and
[17:17] you're constantly chasing these small
[17:18] increases in the value you're extracting
[17:20] out of that career and so when people
[17:24] finally buy their freedom the problem is
[17:27] by that time you've spent 40 Years of
[17:29] your life working in this job you didn't
[17:32] really want to work in you're dedicating
[17:33] eight hours a day you're exhausted when
[17:35] you come home you don't have time to
[17:37] really do any of the things you really
[17:39] enjoy and so getting that education
[17:41] early is huge because you can make the
[17:44] changes early enough in your life where
[17:46] you get to buy back your time and your
[17:48] freedom so that you can deploy it in a
[17:50] way that energizes you where you feel
[17:52] your maximizing your abilities to
[17:54] provide value to the world when you get
[17:57] that type of freedom in your life that's
[17:59] really impactful right I think all the
[18:01] mental health issues and things that we
[18:02] see out there these days are largely
[18:05] driven to people that don't feel like
[18:06] they have a purpose anymore right you're
[18:08] just constantly in this cycle of
[18:11] struggling and bitcoin's giving people a
[18:14] way to think about that differently and
[18:16] if nothing else it's educating them on
[18:18] how to change some approaches in their
[18:21] life to start accumulating that value
[18:24] early on so that you can get out of that
[18:26] rat race sooner than you typically would
[18:29] people have just accepted particularly
[18:31] in the United States that you're
[18:33] basically going to work in a full-time
[18:34] job from the time you're 40 until you're
[18:37] 65 like what a huge portion of your life
[18:40] if you're dedicating it to something
[18:41] you're not truly passionate about and so
[18:44] the education that I think bitcoin's
[18:46] bringing out to people and you know
[18:48] people putting out content like yourself
[18:49] and all the other great podcasters out
[18:51] there that are trying to really capture
[18:53] the value proposition of Bitcoin and
[18:55] bring that out to the masses is a huge
[18:57] service because people weren't getting
[18:59] this education in school I mean the big
[19:01] joke in the US was you can go through a
[19:04] bachelor's degree a master's degree you
[19:06] still never get taught how to file a tax
[19:07] return right like something basic that
[19:09] everybody needs to know it doesn't even
[19:11] become a discussion and so Bitcoin gives
[19:15] people it it puts them in an ecosystem
[19:17] of people that are thinking differently
[19:19] right to become a bitcoiner early you
[19:21] had to have a different mindset than
[19:22] everybody else did and I think that that
[19:26] education now now that the access to
[19:28] that information and there's so many
[19:30] people sharing their experiences and
[19:32] their theories and their thought process
[19:34] around Bitcoin I think that's bringing a
[19:36] lot of the younger generation up to
[19:38] speed a lot faster they've seen the
[19:40] issues Fiat currencies are causing they
[19:42] see The Reckless spending coming out of
[19:44] governments and how they've really got
[19:46] very few tools to correct the path that
[19:48] they put themselves on based on all the
[19:50] debt they've accumulated and so just
[19:52] that shift in society I think is going
[19:54] to be really valuable to the people that
[19:56] embrace it and realize it is they have
[19:59] in front of them that they have access
[20:01] to now it was amazing it's very true I
[20:05] mean I saw it with myself I switched
[20:08] last year to from a fear chop that I
[20:10] kind of liked actually it was not a bad
[20:11] fear chop I kind of liked it but I
[20:13] switched to being in Bitcoin only and
[20:16] doing every day basically what I want to
[20:18] do with the podcast and with everything
[20:20] that I work in the in the space um it's
[20:23] it it feels like retirement uh when I
[20:25] when I talk to my grandpa uh and he's
[20:28] like oh like stand up and do that what I
[20:29] like and this is like like yeah like I'm
[20:31] like I'm like in retirement and I make
[20:34] money with it yeah and you are right I
[20:36] mean that's the thing I think most
[20:38] people have the misnomer of for most
[20:39] people retirement means I go sit on a
[20:41] beach for the rest of my life and don't
[20:42] do anything right I don't view it that
[20:44] way I view it as a shift right you're
[20:47] retiring from doing things you don't
[20:48] want to do anymore right you've freed
[20:51] yourself up you've bought back your time
[20:53] and now in your retirement you get to
[20:55] figure out what it is you're actually
[20:57] passionate about it doesn't mean you
[20:58] stop making money or you start stop
[21:00] putting out value into the world it
[21:02] shifts where your focus is and quite
[21:04] frankly I think it's the reason why
[21:06] there's a lot of people that actually
[21:07] become more successful in retirement
[21:09] right you're no longer tied down to a
[21:11] job you didn't really want to have and
[21:13] and luckily for you it sounded like it
[21:14] was actually an enjoyable job which is
[21:16] good but for most people you're not tied
[21:19] down to that anymore and it finally
[21:21] frees your mind up right the pressures
[21:22] are gone of wondering how you're going
[21:24] to pay the next bill or make the next
[21:26] mortgage or rent payment right whatever
[21:28] it is that was holding you back and now
[21:30] you just get to sit down and take a few
[21:32] minutes to go you know who am I really
[21:35] and what is it that I'm really
[21:37] passionate about and for a lot of us in
[21:39] in our community you know we figured out
[21:41] that there's this major lacking of
[21:44] financial education out there in the
[21:46] world and we were lucky enough to be
[21:49] open-minded enough and have the time to
[21:51] really deep dive into an asset like
[21:53] Bitcoin to create for ourself you know
[21:56] how does this apply to my life how do I
[21:59] change the way that I'm going to save
[22:00] and store the value that I've created it
[22:03] but then when you do figure that out you
[22:05] know everyone has a huge group of people
[22:07] that they really care about and it's one
[22:09] of the things I think is the most
[22:11] different about the Bitcoin Community
[22:13] versus any of the other communities is
[22:15] I've never heard anyone running around
[22:17] telling their family they should sell
[22:18] everything they own and go all in on
[22:20] ethereum never heard it right same with
[22:23] salana never heard it the people that
[22:25] really figure out Bitcoin you're not
[22:27] telling strangers about Bitcoin you're
[22:30] telling your parents you're telling your
[22:32] siblings you're telling your best
[22:33] friends right you're trying to help the
[22:35] people because you've figured out
[22:37] something that they haven't yet right
[22:39] you've seen the problems with the world
[22:41] and the model that they're operating in
[22:44] and you've got a different solution to
[22:47] it and you want to share that because
[22:48] you're trying to free up everybody in
[22:50] your orbit you want everyone to benefit
[22:53] from the same things you are it's not
[22:55] this secret that you hold right it's not
[22:56] like people when they're trading stocks
[22:58] and they think they found an edge and
[23:00] they want to be quiet about it because
[23:01] they don't want anyone else to get in
[23:03] there before them Bitcoin you go tell
[23:05] everyone at least everyone you care
[23:07] about because you see the difference
[23:09] it'll make in their life and you want
[23:10] them to move in that direction and so I
[23:13] I think foundationally in the Bitcoin
[23:16] Community that's one of the biggest
[23:18] differences I've ever seen right you
[23:19] don't try to push anybody you care about
[23:21] into something you think is a highly
[23:23] speculative asset I'd never do it right
[23:26] if I didn't really believe in it I would
[23:28] wouldn't be telling anyone in my close
[23:30] Circle about it but I don't think that
[23:33] at all I actually think this is probably
[23:35] one of the most Val valuable assets
[23:37] that's ever been created for society and
[23:40] it's Unique in the fact that you know
[23:42] when Satoshi left he left Bitcoin to the
[23:44] world and from here the world gets to
[23:46] figure out how we're going to integrate
[23:48] that asset into our society and that's
[23:50] so unique because every other asset that
[23:52] you see out there there's always
[23:53] somebody that's controlling it right
[23:55] look at things like the diamond industry
[23:57] and all the control that company like
[23:58] the beers at right like you've always
[24:00] got this
[24:01] centralized party that's kind of
[24:03] controlling and you've got all the gold
[24:05] miners Mining and changing the supply
[24:07] that they're mining to try to keep the
[24:09] right you get these games Bitcoin you
[24:11] don't have that the Creator just walked
[24:13] away and left it to the world and you
[24:15] know now the world gets to figure out
[24:17] what does peerto pure mean to you and
[24:20] that's a beautiful gift because
[24:21] society's going to change right when
[24:23] Satoshi was creating Bitcoin it was a
[24:25] much different world than it is today
[24:28] and so Bitcoin has so many applications
[24:30] that I think people don't even look at
[24:32] like what's going to create the
[24:34] financial economy between AI systems
[24:36] when those are out there right well
[24:38] you've got this great digital monetary
[24:40] Network that's decentralized from anyone
[24:42] else that would seem like a pretty good
[24:44] solution to it so you're going to have
[24:46] all these uses out there in the world
[24:48] for Bitcoin that I don't even think we
[24:49] can conceptualize yet but that's the
[24:51] beauty of it being a technology that was
[24:53] released to the world is now the
[24:55] creativity of individuals gets to really
[24:58] come out and figure out now that we have
[25:00] something that's truly liberated from
[25:02] controls of people that are Bad actors
[25:05] often how do we use it how do we
[25:07] maximize the value to Society on the
[25:10] rails of the strongest decentralized
[25:12] monetary Network in the world and that
[25:14] creates a very exciting outlook for the
[25:16] future that I think a lot of people have
[25:18] been missing for a very long time and it
[25:20] makes me really excited about it and
[25:22] that's why we tell our loved ones that's
[25:24] why we we don't and it's that's why it's
[25:27] also hard because usually uh you you
[25:30] want to orange pill them but they
[25:31] usually not as ready as you are and then
[25:35] you like uh try trying to uh drill a a
[25:40] hole in in a wall that just doesn't want
[25:43] to be drilled kind of right but it's the
[25:46] effort of of caring right I mean you're
[25:48] putting in an exorbitant amount of
[25:50] effort nobody who really believes in it
[25:52] gives up after the first no right and it
[25:55] does make you feel like a Salesman at
[25:56] times but I think that's actually part
[25:58] of what brings people around is you know
[26:01] if you just went and told them about
[26:02] Bitcoin and then they said no and you
[26:04] never told them about it again you know
[26:06] to them it's like all right he was
[26:07] trying to sell me something but when you
[26:09] keep coming back and just slowly piecing
[26:12] together that knowledge base for them
[26:14] and helping them to understand where the
[26:16] value is here I mean that becomes really
[26:19] powerful because when people see you
[26:20] putting in that type of effort right
[26:23] particularly if you're not trying to
[26:24] push them into it I don't ever try to
[26:26] push anybody into buying anything
[26:28] including Bitcoin right because I think
[26:31] if you just go buy something it never
[26:34] feels secure to you right you're
[26:37] constant that's when you're going to be
[26:38] constantly focused on the price charts
[26:40] and it goes down 10% and you start
[26:43] freaking out and thinking that you got
[26:44] into a bad investment right so I don't
[26:46] ever start there I always start with you
[26:49] know talking about the issues with
[26:51] monetary debasement and helping people
[26:53] understand what that means for the value
[26:56] of what they've saved over the lifetime
[26:58] of of a career and how that's going to
[26:59] be impacted and the loss of purchasing
[27:01] power I actually start there and help
[27:04] people understand the foundational issue
[27:06] that they're facing and then from there
[27:09] you can start to introduce here's an
[27:11] alternative thought process here's an
[27:12] alternative asset that has some very
[27:14] unique qualities to it that were
[27:16] specifically engineered to help mitigate
[27:18] these problems that we're having in
[27:21] society and when you do it that way and
[27:24] you don't start with pushing it on
[27:26] people they're much more receptive
[27:28] particularly if these people respect you
[27:31] and respect your opinion on things right
[27:33] if you've not been trying to you know
[27:35] sell them every token that's come out of
[27:36] the gate and you're going here's a
[27:39] different way to approach retaining
[27:41] value in your life and you start with
[27:44] the foundation of the problems you get
[27:46] to the solution you explain all the
[27:48] different features Bitcoin has right the
[27:50] peer-to-peer capabilities the security
[27:52] of the network right you start talking
[27:54] them through everything once you know
[27:56] what you're buying right once once I
[27:58] really understood what I had with
[28:00] Bitcoin it's the most peaceful part of
[28:02] my investing life I forget to look at it
[28:05] for months because it doesn't matter
[28:08] because I know what I own right now and
[28:10] I know what the problems are broadly in
[28:11] the world and I don't see those changing
[28:14] so I can't come up with anything else I
[28:16] would rather be owning right now and
[28:19] because of that it becomes this
[28:21] foundational component to your entire
[28:23] Financial life that you just don't have
[28:26] to spend a single minute worrying about
[28:28] anymore because as long as you believe
[28:31] that over a long period of time they're
[28:33] going to continue to debase you know the
[28:35] US dollar whatever currency that you're
[28:37] holding on to and you don't see
[28:39] governments quickly flipping a switch
[28:41] and becoming these efficient value
[28:43] creation machines that are you know
[28:45] creating jobs like crazy and the
[28:47] economies are always going to be roaring
[28:49] right as long as that's not your outlook
[28:51] you feel real secure holding Bitcoin
[28:53] because you know that this kind of Ops
[28:55] you out of that system and you go I'm
[28:57] going to go with something I can truly
[28:59] understand where there's not people
[29:00] behind the scenes pulling different
[29:02] levers with different self-interest that
[29:04] they're trying to fulfill I want
[29:06] something that's separated from that
[29:08] right I want to decentralize my
[29:10] financial life from that type of a
[29:12] system and I'm going to store my value
[29:16] over in this asset that I know I can
[29:18] count on I know exactly how it's going
[29:20] to behave there's no Mysteries around it
[29:23] and because of that once I own it I
[29:25] don't have to watch the price anymore it
[29:26] can go down it can go up it's really not
[29:28] a big deal I actually watch price far
[29:31] more on the equities that I'm investing
[29:33] in which mostly are in the Bitcoin
[29:35] ecosystem as well but I actually spend
[29:38] far more time watching those the Bitcoin
[29:40] that I own I'm not worried because I'm
[29:41] not doing anything with it right now
[29:43] right that is my store of value for my
[29:45] own personal life and because of that
[29:48] I'm just happy to let that sit in
[29:51] storage out there and I don't have to
[29:53] spend a minute worrying about what the
[29:55] price action's doing because I've seen
[29:56] enough and I've spent enough time
[29:59] analyzing the financial markets and
[30:01] understanding the currencies to know
[30:04] that this is where I can feel secure so
[30:06] I'll spend all my other energy on this
[30:09] side trying to create additional value
[30:10] and maybe I won't be able to out base
[30:12] Bitcoin over in that area but it's fun
[30:14] to try so I like to do that as well
[30:16] right I'm not just 100% Bitcoin although
[30:19] that is the foundation of all of my
[30:21] investing I think anyone that's doing
[30:23] their investing you start with
[30:25] Bitcoin and then on the other side you
[30:28] know I I try to have some fun and see if
[30:29] I can generate returns in excess of
[30:31] Bitcoin on the other side of my
[30:33] portfolio operating it on a Bitcoin
[30:34] standard so it's h it keeps you really
[30:37] engaged and it also keeps you interested
[30:39] in the developments that are happening
[30:41] out there in the corporate world as it
[30:42] pertains to bitcoin I partnered up with
[30:46] coin vigilante this is the most

[32:50] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[32:53] how you can level up your sovereignty
[32:56] are you doing that with uh Bitcoin play
[32:59] like micro strategy or also with
[33:01] completely outside of the Bitcoin real
[33:04] uh companies like I don't know like
[33:06] Tesla Nvidia or something like that yeah
[33:09] so it largely got to micro strategy and
[33:12] that'll be no surprise to anyone who who
[33:14] knows me and what I cover is that I got
[33:17] into micro strategy initially largely
[33:20] not because I understood their strategy
[33:22] at all I really didn't and it wasn't
[33:24] clear at the in the early days what it
[33:25] was they were doing other than they
[33:27] converted their treasury over to bitcoin
[33:29] and that was kind of the first step but
[33:31] I got into them because I looked at it
[33:33] as I've been in Bitcoin long enough that
[33:35] what I'm looking for is Corporate
[33:37] adoption so I'm going to support any
[33:38] company that's supporting Bitcoin that
[33:40] was really the entirety of my thesis
[33:42] early on which is a hilarious way to
[33:44] invest so when they converted their
[33:47] treasury I said I'm in right I'll take
[33:49] this ride so I bought into micro
[33:51] strategy and then over time when you saw
[33:55] them really foundationally changing the
[33:58] way that corporations operate to create
[34:01] value and to return value to
[34:04] shareholders it didn't take all that
[34:06] long to go well wait a second there's
[34:07] something else happening here right this
[34:09] isn't just a we don't hold dollars
[34:11] anymore this is the pursuit of active
[34:15] accumulation of digital Capital right
[34:18] and sailor was always doing a really
[34:20] good job explaining that but you know
[34:22] like most people you know I'm not immune
[34:24] to it it took me a while to figure out
[34:26] what he was saying I didn't really no
[34:28] and I couldn't figure it out you know
[34:29] you're taking on debt and you're buying
[34:31] Bitcoin and you can conceptually
[34:34] understand the Arbitrage opportunity
[34:36] there but you start to think the way
[34:38] everyone else does and you go well
[34:39] that's really risky right like you're
[34:41] betting the farm on this and when you're
[34:43] using traditional debt that's very true
[34:46] right if you're tied into Banks those
[34:48] bank loans come with a lot of strings
[34:51] right there's a lot of covenants that
[34:52] are in place around loan Dev values on
[34:54] collateral around debt service coverage
[34:57] so you got have a certain amount of cash
[34:58] flow that can cover the debts that you
[35:00] owe to them and usually that's like you
[35:02] have to have twice the amount of your
[35:03] debt coverage something in that range
[35:06] and so that part initially scared me
[35:08] because I came from Commercial Banking
[35:11] that was my first job out of college was
[35:13] I was a credit Analyst at a regional
[35:16] bank and that was right during the
[35:17] financial crisis and so quickly when I
[35:21] got into the bank you know I started as
[35:23] a credit analyst but then it turned out
[35:25] so much of the bank was non-performing
[35:27] loans
[35:28] that I shifted and I started working and
[35:31] it was called the special assets group
[35:33] right what a great name but it was
[35:34] basically all the unperformed loans of
[35:36] the bank these were the risk areas to
[35:38] the bank failing and Banks were failing
[35:40] all the time so my job was to underwrite
[35:44] and monitor all these non-performing
[35:46] loans come up with restructuring
[35:48] agreements collect on collateral if we
[35:50] needed to so I saw the downside of
[35:53] having debt and then getting yourself
[35:56] into a situation where you couldn't
[35:57] cover it I knew what that meant and so
[36:00] when I first saw micro strategy make
[36:02] that shift it concerned me a little bit
[36:06] and I didn't really understand it and
[36:07] even you know I I think I was right to
[36:09] be a little concerned and then when you
[36:11] had all the issues with silvergate you
[36:13] know everyone else started looking too
[36:14] going there's a there's a lot of risk in
[36:16] that type of an approach so it was a
[36:18] huge sigh of relief when I watched them
[36:21] shift that strategy from using
[36:23] Traditional Bank debt into using things
[36:25] like convertible Bond offerings because
[36:27] you changed the risk profile of the
[36:30] investment
[36:31] drastically so you know micro strategy
[36:34] became this interesting story of
[36:36] corporate adoption because it wasn't
[36:38] just about corporations you know wanting
[36:41] to own Bitcoin instead of cash theirs
[36:45] was this pursuit of value using the
[36:50] capital markets to create it for them
[36:53] right it was a shift from the focus on
[36:54] the income statement and trying to build
[36:57] your core product offering and generate
[36:59] higher net income returns year-over-year
[37:01] which is how most corporations are
[37:03] valued right you look at the income
[37:05] statement and every analyst is looking
[37:06] for Topline growth bottom line growth
[37:09] margin growth micro strategy shifted and
[37:13] you can think about it like a like an
[37:15] individual when you look at things like
[37:17] your job versus your retirement accounts
[37:19] right one of them you're spending all
[37:21] your time focusing on trying to get a
[37:23] five or a 10% raise year-over-year on
[37:25] your salary but but then eventually you
[37:28] accumulate enough assets on your balance
[37:30] sheet where you go maybe my efforts
[37:33] aren't best spent on 5% of my income
[37:37] maybe 5% is a much more drastic number
[37:40] if I find 5% more return on the value in
[37:43] my balance sheet right both create value
[37:45] in my life but one actually creates more
[37:49] and so micro strategies saw that because
[37:51] they had this struggling Core Business
[37:53] where they're competing with these you
[37:54] know huge corporations like Microsoft
[37:58] for these bi products and and they saw
[38:00] that that's a really tough business to
[38:02] be in and it's a really tough business
[38:03] to grow in but they had a very unique
[38:07] position where they had this really
[38:09] clean balance sheet right they had tons
[38:12] of financial assets right it was lots of
[38:14] cash they were fairly unencumbered by
[38:17] debt at least not any debt that they
[38:18] couldn't get rid of and so that made
[38:21] them a really unique story for this
[38:24] Bitcoin accumulation strategy because
[38:27] they had the ability to transform their
[38:29] balance sheet to have this massive
[38:31] Reliance on
[38:33] bitcoin and what sailor figured out long
[38:36] before anybody else did was that Bitcoin
[38:39] being a new and emerging asset class
[38:42] comes with inherent volatility and
[38:44] significant
[38:45] volatility and he figured out that he
[38:49] could change the way people looked at
[38:51] his company where they're no longer
[38:52] looking at them necessarily for the bi
[38:55] business and just focusing on the growth
[38:56] of the bi business what he could do was
[38:59] he could make their balance sheet almost
[39:01] entirely reliant on bitcoin the asset
[39:05] and with that comes the volatility
[39:07] profile to the equity that Bitcoin
[39:10] brings so with Bitcoin being a 60 I
[39:12] think the implied volatility now
[39:15] something like 64 65 he said just that
[39:18] alone is significantly more volatility
[39:20] than most equities have right most will
[39:22] be in that 15 10 to 15 range so then he
[39:26] took it a step further and he said well
[39:27] what if instead of focusing you know
[39:30] just on that bi business what if we
[39:32] created a different vertical right what
[39:33] if we created a new product out of our
[39:36] company and to do that he said let's
[39:39] take the volatility that Bitcoin offers
[39:42] we're going to make our balance sheet
[39:43] comprised almost entirely of Bitcoin we
[39:46] don't have a lot of other big fixed
[39:47] assets that are clogging up the balance
[39:49] sheet so almost entirely Bitcoin then
[39:52] we're going to take out additional
[39:55] leverage right through different debt or
[39:57] fixed income instruments and we're going
[39:58] to buy more Bitcoin so now our bit our
[40:01] balance sheets not just comprised 100%
[40:03] of Bitcoin now it's levered on top of
[40:06] that Bitcoin and what he figured out was
[40:09] that what he was doing was engineering a
[40:11] new product and that new product was the
[40:13] equity he was creating this universally
[40:16] desirable trading instrument for all
[40:19] types of capital right all investors
[40:21] need volatility to generate returns
[40:24] right it's that movement in the market
[40:26] that allows people in long positions to
[40:28] make money short positions to make money
[40:30] if you're trading derivatives you make
[40:31] money on the move right it created this
[40:34] unique product that the market really
[40:36] doesn't have today and he did that using
[40:39] Bitcoin and the volatility that Bitcoin
[40:41] brings so it quickly made me very
[40:45] interested in that company because it
[40:48] was clear people weren't understanding
[40:50] what was happening people were looking
[40:52] at it as just this risky bet and you
[40:54] know it's running way up and it's
[40:56] crashing and that freaks a lot of people
[40:58] out but when you start to see what
[41:00] they're engineering over there it starts
[41:02] to change your perception of that Equity
[41:04] so it was that shift in thinking that
[41:07] really made that one of the core
[41:09] equities that I trade I do trade some
[41:11] other things I'm interested in the
[41:13] emergence of you know Ai and I like
[41:15] energy plays because I think energy is
[41:17] going to be a big asset so I do trade in
[41:19] other things as well but it's become
[41:22] very narrow right I got well out of the
[41:25] the normal portfolio which I had before
[41:27] which was just own a bunch of index
[41:28] funds and you just hope you get your 10
[41:30] to 12% returns a year you know and
[41:33] everything's great I got well away from
[41:34] that because now I'll only invest in
[41:36] things that I'm deeply committed to
[41:39] understanding and really I think that's
[41:41] the only Edge you can find in the market
[41:43] these days because most people are
[41:44] investing blindly they don't really know
[41:46] what they own so I try to make sure that
[41:49] I'm only investing in the things I truly
[41:52] understand so that that I think really
[41:54] does bring an edge because you can be
[41:56] long term about those types of companies
[41:58] when you know what the model is and what
[42:00] they're trying to accomplish it shocks
[42:03] me when I speak with friends and when I
[42:05] speak with people that uh I know outside
[42:09] of Bitcoin and ask them okay like where
[42:12] like okay if if not Bitcoin where where
[42:15] do you put your money and and uh then
[42:18] they say stuff like they have some
[42:21] companies they have an ETF they have
[42:23] whatever and and I ask them one simple
[42:25] question like oh like what's your Fe is
[42:27] behind that and that's like usually like
[42:29] a two sentence answer to that I'm like
[42:32] that that's it like that's where you're
[42:34] putting your life savings like yeah it
[42:36] can be a good play but like you you
[42:38] should be like you should at least be
[42:40] educated about it it's amazing how
[42:43] comfortable people get investing in
[42:44] things they have no idea about right
[42:46] like if you went and someone who's
[42:48] buying the S&P 500 you gave them that
[42:50] list of companies and I didn't really
[42:53] understand this until I started seeing
[42:55] the list right while people started
[42:57] tracking the where micro strategy Falls
[42:59] in terms of the companies that are in
[43:00] the S&P 500 and you start seeing all
[43:03] these names pop up and you go I don't
[43:05] have any idea what that company does and
[43:07] it was the majority of them I just I I'd
[43:09] never heard of them before and so you
[43:12] start to think like if I'm just buying
[43:14] this ETF product that's comprised of
[43:18] these 500 companies and I probably can't
[43:21] name 75% of them or tell you what they
[43:24] do why am I investing in that right why
[43:27] is that a good alternative to me than
[43:30] something I I understand deeply right so
[43:33] and then when you start digging a little
[43:34] further and you go well there's like
[43:35] seven companies that make up the
[43:37] entirety of the return which means that
[43:40] the other 593 companies are just a drag
[43:43] on or 493 companies are just a drag on
[43:46] the overall return profile of that
[43:48] product
[43:49] well why would I buy that right why
[43:52] wouldn't I just buy the seven that are
[43:53] giving me returns why am I blending it
[43:55] with all this other stuff that doesn't
[43:57] make any money and generates no returns
[43:59] has no volatility to it so you really do
[44:03] have to question your own investing when
[44:06] you start to understand these things and
[44:09] rationalize it for yourself and if you
[44:11] can't you've got a bit of a problem on
[44:13] your hands investing blindly isn't a way
[44:16] to success right it's why if you go and
[44:19] you generate the S&P 500 returns but you
[44:22] adjust it for inflation excuse me you
[44:24] adjust it for inflation it's basically
[44:26] flat it's done nothing right and so when
[44:29] you see that you go oh my gosh like I'm
[44:31] just it's a game right you're just
[44:34] basically keeping up you can basically
[44:36] view the S&P 500 as monetary debasement
[44:39] right that's really kind of your
[44:40] benchmark return and so it it's it's a
[44:44] shift in the way you think about all of
[44:46] your Investments that you're going to
[44:47] take and it's amazing how impactful that
[44:50] becomes right after you track it you
[44:53] make that change and then you start
[44:54] tracking your returns relative to the
[44:56] S&P
[44:57] 500 and you start to almost sometimes
[45:00] you outperform in almost a scary way
[45:03] like it it starts to almost make you
[45:05] question like it's too good sometimes
[45:09] and I don't know like I I can't say that
[45:12] that keeps up forever I don't know right
[45:14] I mean things go in Cycles you've got
[45:15] Global liquidity cycles that impact
[45:17] markets and right now Bitcoin falls into
[45:19] the risk asset profile right so I mean
[45:21] I'm not I'm not blind to those
[45:23] connections and that's a real thing but
[45:26] when you take out all the drags in your
[45:29] portfolio and you start looking at where
[45:31] the world's going instead of where it is
[45:34] today it can really make you more
[45:37] excited about building that profile
[45:40] because now you're looking for the areas
[45:42] that you see the value coming in the
[45:44] next 5 10 15 years versus you know
[45:47] what's worked for the last 30 because
[45:49] we're in a very different world today
[45:51] than we were 30 years ago so a lot of
[45:53] those names that have basically
[45:55] transitioned themselves into dividend
[45:57] paying stocks which just essentially
[45:59] tells you they're out of ideas to
[46:00] generate value so they're just going to
[46:02] give the money back because they can't
[46:04] come up with any better ways to deploy
[46:06] it right that's that's a little scary
[46:08] because that became such a profound part
[46:10] of investing for people was they were
[46:12] looking for that income component that
[46:13] dividend payment but they never really
[46:16] understood what that meant right you
[46:18] have to think about why would a company
[46:19] just be giving you money back right you
[46:22] have to think about that and connect
[46:23] those dots and you go oh my gosh they're
[46:25] out of ideas they've got maybe a strong
[46:28] business for today that generates a ton
[46:30] of cash flow and because of that they
[46:32] can return value to shareholders just by
[46:34] giving it back but you know sailor made
[46:36] a pretty good argument for well why
[46:39] wouldn't you take that money that you
[46:41] don't have a better idea for and inject
[46:44] growth into your company through an
[46:47] asset like Bitcoin you don't even have
[46:49] to invest in building a new product or
[46:51] standing up this department full of
[46:53] people and research and development
[46:55] teams and sales teams you don't have to
[46:56] do any of that you can inject growth
[46:59] into your business and into your balance
[47:00] sheet simply by taking the largest
[47:04] decentralized monetary Network and
[47:07] injecting that growth into your business
[47:09] that's returning 60% right what's better
[47:11] for shareholders giving them that
[47:13] dividend or allowing that to compound at
[47:15] 60% a year the Math's really easy so I
[47:18] think it's going to become unavoidable
[47:20] for corporations ultimately and it's
[47:22] almost going to become negligent here
[47:24] pretty shortly for these boards not to
[47:26] at least consider this as a part of the
[47:29] strategy for the organization because
[47:30] it's being proven out over and over
[47:33] again the value that this asset's
[47:35] returning and it's also showing value in
[47:39] that volatility that it can bring to
[47:41] your Equity when you have this as a part
[47:42] of your core business now and so I think
[47:45] that's going to become this unavoidable
[47:47] discussion point where if your board's
[47:50] not at least talking about it and trying
[47:52] to figure out what this means for your
[47:54] company Long Term and what it means to
[47:56] not part participate that's the question
[47:58] I would love to start seeing more boards
[48:00] answer that are saying no to this is
[48:03] what's your thesis on why it's better
[48:05] not to participate in this because what
[48:07] if you're in an industry that's got you
[48:09] know five companies in it and you're all
[48:11] relatively the same size and one company
[48:15] adopts Bitcoin as their treasury Reserve
[48:17] asset and all the other ones just go on
[48:19] status quo paying out dividends to their
[48:21] investors fast forward 10 years which
[48:24] company in that peer group do you think
[48:26] is more powerful it's probably the one
[48:29] that made that shift right really
[48:30] understood they're now not only just
[48:33] retaining the value within the
[48:34] organization by not paying out the
[48:36] dividend they're investing that into a
[48:38] new growth instrument and then they're
[48:39] compounding that value they might be the
[48:42] company that ends up owning the other
[48:44] four companies right they might become
[48:46] that powerful so you have to look at it
[48:48] from an organizational perspective as to
[48:50] what are the risks not to participate
[48:53] and that risk is that your peers pass
[48:55] you up in a sign ific way where they're
[48:58] now so much more well capitalized that
[49:01] their flexibility for growth in the
[49:03] future whether that be through you know
[49:05] Acquisitions or new products or whatever
[49:06] they're going to have the capital to
[49:08] have that flexibility to reinvent
[49:10] themselves because as a corporation if
[49:12] you're not in a constant state of
[49:14] transformation you're dying right no
[49:18] company gets to stay static forever the
[49:20] world changes the types of products
[49:22] people need change the Innovation just
[49:24] within your industry changes that makes
[49:26] products you offered obsolete so if your
[49:28] organization's not in a constant state
[49:30] of transformation you're going to fall
[49:32] behind your peer groups and that's why
[49:34] so many companies cease to exist but if
[49:36] you make a shift now and you say maybe
[49:39] we don't have an idea today but what
[49:41] we're going to do is we're going to take
[49:43] our strong business and we're going to
[49:44] preserve the value we're generating
[49:46] today and we're going to put that into
[49:48] digital Capital which we think is the
[49:50] capital of the future and we're going to
[49:52] allow that to continue its compounding
[49:55] trajectory maybe it keeps getting %
[49:57] maybe it drops down to 25% whatever it
[49:59] is you know we're going to keep
[50:01] compounding that value on our balance
[50:03] sheet so when the time comes and we see
[50:05] that next opportunity we're going to be
[50:08] so well capitalized that there's nothing
[50:10] that's going to be able to stop us from
[50:11] executing on that idea right and I think
[50:14] that that's a big shift that a lot of
[50:16] companies and a lot of boards at
[50:17] companies are going to need to make
[50:19] because there's a lot of complacency out
[50:21] there and they need to start being more
[50:23] forward-looking than they've had to be
[50:24] in the past I love that so much I never
[50:27] looked at dividends as a sign of a
[50:30] company kind of slowing down and running
[50:32] out of ERS that that's that's an amaz I
[50:35] I was a stock investor before Bitcoin
[50:37] and I naturally avoided dividend things
[50:41] because they NE never had any stories I
[50:45] feel like but I never connected those
[50:46] thoughts of like why I don't like
[50:48] dividends and like the the growth stocks
[50:50] more because the dividend payers usually
[50:52] don't have that big of a growth story
[50:55] anymore good thing is you're in inks
[50:56] were correct so it kept you away but uh
[50:59] I mean they have a place for some people
[51:01] right you you have to respect that every
[51:03] individual has a different risk profile
[51:06] they're willing to invest in the
[51:08] difference is for people that are like
[51:10] us we don't see areas that are connected
[51:13] to bitcoin as being risky I actually
[51:15] view it as the ultimate risk off asset
[51:18] right I'm taking all the centralized
[51:20] control and all the games out of it so I
[51:22] view it as the ultimate going riskof
[51:24] asset right I feel like I'm AA investor
[51:27] right I'm investing in the most valuable
[51:29] asset I can find uh but for other people
[51:33] you know they they need cash flows as a
[51:35] sign of life it's the only thing that
[51:37] matters to them and these dividend
[51:38] paying stocks that are just generating a
[51:40] lot of cash and giving it back that
[51:41] feels good in their life maybe they need
[51:44] that cash flow maybe that's how they're
[51:45] funding their life right everyone's got
[51:47] different situations but I do think it's
[51:50] a great question people have to ask
[51:52] themselves when they review their own
[51:53] portfolios and you go why do I own this
[51:56] and what do I think like if they're
[51:58] giving me all this cash back why why are
[52:00] they giving me all this cash back you
[52:02] know they're a big company they've
[52:03] always been a Innovative company they at
[52:06] least created a product that was good
[52:07] enough to create this Core Business
[52:09] that's throwing off all this cash
[52:11] flow why aren't they continuing to build
[52:14] and make it better right what are they
[52:15] doing and being able at least in your
[52:19] own personal investing life to ask that
[52:21] question is is a very powerful tool
[52:24] because it shifts how you view all the
[52:27] value that you're holding in your
[52:28] portfolio and it makes you go through
[52:31] that exercise of rationalizing why am I
[52:33] in this investment what is it about this
[52:35] company that I think makes it a good
[52:38] thing for me to hold over the next
[52:39] decade right how do I see them being a
[52:41] better company 10 years down the road
[52:44] than they are today and when you stop
[52:47] being able to answer that question if
[52:48] you've got you know five years of
[52:51] evidence that says they're just going to
[52:52] keep doing the same thing forever now to
[52:55] me that not a good long-term investment
[52:58] because if I don't see a company
[53:00] constantly evolving and adapting to the
[53:02] world changing around them that's not
[53:04] something I'm comfortable holding for 10
[53:06] years because innovation's happening at
[53:09] lightning speeds now and if you ignore
[53:13] that that Trend you're going to fall
[53:15] behind and your portfolio is going to
[53:17] ultimately end up underperforming what
[53:19] all these other companies are because
[53:20] the big names today in stocks are not
[53:23] going to be the big names in 10 years
[53:24] look how fast companies like Google and
[53:27] meta and Nvidia look at how fast they
[53:30] all Rose they came out of nowhere
[53:32] seemingly right and now there's such
[53:34] core parts of our world today that you
[53:36] can almost not remember back to the time
[53:39] where they didn't exist but it wasn't
[53:40] that long ago so if you think that the
[53:43] trend is going to be different for the
[53:44] next 20 years and all of a sudden the
[53:46] world's going to take a breather and
[53:47] just pause and nothing no new
[53:49] innovation's going to come and no new
[53:50] Mega corporations are going to show up
[53:53] that that's just detached from reality
[53:56] right right innovation's going to happen
[53:57] at the speed of light we're going to see
[53:59] far more than we probably saw in the
[54:01] past so you've got to be ready to adapt
[54:04] with the
[54:05] times that's super interesting um one
[54:08] thing that um uh
[54:11] like Michael zaa has his price models
[54:14] like there's power L model there's so
[54:16] many different uh
[54:19] TR uh tries out there of like how to
[54:22] model the growth of Bitcoin and the
[54:24] price of Bitcoin is kind of just an uh
[54:26] function of that because it has like the
[54:29] component of how how is Bitcoin growing
[54:32] and uh how fast is the the US dollar uh
[54:35] devaluing like those two aspects are
[54:38] kind of um controlling of where the
[54:41] Bitcoin price is going um how do you
[54:43] look at the growth level uh of of of
[54:48] Bitcoin in the coming future here I
[54:50] think like blackr was the one that said
[54:52] like it's growing faster than than
[54:54] mobile phones and the internet
[54:56] they brought up some something how do
[54:58] you look at uh how fast Bitcoin will
[55:02] grow in the coming years and obviously
[55:03] that also impacts the price but there's
[55:06] also more aspects to that yeah I think
[55:09] all the models like they're good right
[55:11] it's good to have models because it
[55:13] helps you to conceptualize the scale of
[55:15] the opportunity that's out there I don't
[55:18] prescribe myself to any individual
[55:20] growth model that's out there because I
[55:21] don't think we know right with most of
[55:24] these models we're taking historical
[55:25] performance performance and we're trying
[55:27] to project it forward to give us some
[55:29] conceptual idea for what that growth
[55:31] rate is going to look like and I think
[55:34] it's good for people to understand the
[55:37] opportunity but I think sometimes when
[55:39] you get tied into too many models you
[55:41] start to put yourself more in the
[55:43] mindset of a Trader again and when
[55:46] you're looking at that and you see
[55:49] things like these price bands that price
[55:51] is probably going to operate in well
[55:53] that gets you into the mindset of okay
[55:55] well when it gets to the top of the band
[55:57] I'm going to sell out and then I'll be
[55:58] able to buy more down and the answer to
[56:00] that is maybe but we don't know yet
[56:03] because I think that the speed that that
[56:04] adoption curve is going to come is is
[56:07] going to blow a lot of people's minds if
[56:09] you just look at you know the number of
[56:11] countries that are out there right if we
[56:13] just focus on nation state adoption for
[56:15] this
[56:16] asset and you look at how many countries
[56:19] have given up their ability to have
[56:21] their own fiat currency they've
[56:23] dollarized themselves or they pegged
[56:25] themselves to some other currency
[56:27] you've got a problem if you're those
[56:29] countries now if a country like the
[56:31] United States and you've seen all the
[56:34] talk in the brics Nations about them
[56:36] potentially using Bitcoin to settle
[56:38] trade right when you see all the
[56:40] powerful economies in the world shifting
[56:43] into this area where they're becoming
[56:44] favorable towards Bitcoin and they're
[56:47] looking at utilizing a decentralized
[56:50] asset like Bitcoin which became really
[56:53] eye-opening when the US weaponized the
[56:55] Swift Network against Russia that right
[56:58] there was an advertisement to all these
[57:01] nation states to make sure that they
[57:03] make themselves resilient in the event
[57:06] that they get on the wrong side of some
[57:08] of the powers in the world so now you've
[57:10] got to look at it if you're a nation you
[57:13] have to evaluate your financial standing
[57:16] because what you don't have the luxury
[57:18] of is the ability to print your own
[57:21] currency to buy the asset you can't
[57:23] print so if you've already given that
[57:27] you've got to essentially make this move
[57:29] before countries like the United States
[57:32] and Russia and China and all these big
[57:35] superpowers out there before they start
[57:37] accumulating you essentially need to get
[57:39] there first because you don't have the
[57:41] ability to print your own currency to
[57:44] buy Bitcoin they do so they are price
[57:47] agnostic buyers they'll buy it at any
[57:50] price because they're essentially buying
[57:52] it with something they create right it
[57:54] really doesn't matter
[57:56] but if you're a company that has
[57:58] dollarized yourself you do have a finite
[58:00] amount of currency within your country
[58:02] so you're looking at this if you're
[58:04] looking at it
[58:05] strategically you're going I might have
[58:08] an opportunity right now to front run
[58:10] the superpowers right before their
[58:12] Capital comes and starts acquiring this
[58:14] network that's not tied to any country
[58:17] right I could start acquiring that today
[58:20] and I will get the economic benefit of
[58:23] their purchasing power later so when you
[58:26] look at a country like El Salvador that
[58:28] really picked up on this very quickly
[58:30] and went in in a big way they're going
[58:32] to totally change their economic
[58:34] standing in the world because of that
[58:36] shift and other smaller countries are
[58:39] going to start to realize that that if
[58:41] they're the last ones left holding the
[58:44] currency that's devalued in such a
[58:45] significant way their country is going
[58:48] to be significantly worse off than it is
[58:50] now because they're not going to have
[58:52] the ability to make that transition in a
[58:54] way that's advantageous to themselves
[58:57] so when I start game theing out what
[58:59] that looks like I just see this rapid
[59:03] adoption curve right the question
[59:05] everyone's arguing about is when does it
[59:08] start right what is that Catalyst that
[59:11] kicks off that major steep part of an
[59:14] adoption curve and I think just the fact
[59:17] that the US is even talking about it is
[59:19] probably going to get it there rather
[59:20] quickly but because we're short-term in
[59:23] nature people are looking for you know
[59:24] does it start day one of a presidency is
[59:27] it day two right I don't necessarily
[59:29] think of those terms but I think of do I
[59:31] see it as being more likely than not in
[59:32] the next two years yeah absolutely
[59:35] probably quicker but I think that that
[59:38] shift in the fact that it's not taboo to
[59:40] talk about for a country like the United
[59:42] States anymore that's going to give a
[59:45] level of confidence to Nations that they
[59:48] can start adopting it and further down
[59:50] the chain to corporations to say if
[59:53] they're thinking about it we should
[59:55] definitely be thinking about it and so
[59:57] the pools of capital that keep opening
[59:59] up to bitcoin are getting bigger and
[60:01] bigger and bigger and so I look at that
[60:04] and go for right now I just want to be
[60:06] in the asset I'm not going to try to
[60:08] time this because I don't know and I
[60:10] don't think anybody else does either you
[60:12] can build me all the models in the world
[60:14] I don't think you're going to be able to
[60:15] call this adoption curve in the way
[60:17] people think that they're going to be
[60:18] able to and that's okay I I like that
[60:21] people are building these models because
[60:23] I think it creates some interesting you
[60:25] know data point point that people can
[60:26] use and it gives people a longterm
[60:29] Horizon to look at sometimes which I
[60:31] think is really necessary because of
[60:33] that short-term Focus that we have but
[60:35] to me I just look at all the catalysts
[60:38] that I see on the horizon for the big
[60:40] pools of capital that are still outside
[60:42] of this
[60:43] ecosystem and in my mind I try to think
[60:46] through when are the incentives going to
[60:47] be aligned correctly for that Capital to
[60:50] enter the market and I think we're
[60:52] getting pretty close to that now and so
[60:56] look for that adoption curve to probably
[60:58] kick off sooner than later we're already
[61:00] in it I mean let's not pretend that
[61:02] we're not but the rapid the race to get
[61:05] into it to buy the finite asset is going
[61:08] to be on faster and more powerful than
[61:12] people think it's going to come so it's
[61:13] more about being in position versus
[61:16] trying to time that position because if
[61:18] you miss it it's not going to be good
[61:21] right you don't want to be on the back
[61:23] end of an adoption curve you'd like to
[61:24] be on the front end of an adopt adoption
[61:26] curve so you're still very much on the
[61:28] front end of the adoption curve today
[61:30] but nobody can promise how long that's
[61:32] going to last that's that's very true
[61:35] and also the point that you making uh
[61:37] about the dangerous game of uh trying to
[61:41] time the market meaning trying to sell
[61:45] some all of your Bitcoin just to buy big
[61:47] more that's the most dangerous game you
[61:49] could possibly play play because you
[61:52] don't know when all of the sudden Apple
[61:56] you you're selling because you think
[61:57] it's going down all of the sudden apple
[61:59] is issuing like uh some quarterly thing
[62:02] and saying like oh like yeah we
[62:04] converted 20% of our balance sheet to
[62:06] bitcoin because it's the best possible
[62:07] play I don't think that's happen anytime
[62:09] soon but it's possible and then
[62:11] bitcoin's ripping free ACC and you can
[62:14] never uh buy yourself back in yeah and I
[62:17] had that in my own life right I mean I
[62:19] do think you learned that lesson over
[62:21] time like the very first time I ever
[62:22] bought Bitcoin was in November 2013 I
[62:26] think was the first time I found it and
[62:27] it was like
[62:29] $264 something to that range and so I
[62:32] bought bought a bunch of Bitcoin at the
[62:33] time and then it went up to 1300 real
[62:36] quickly after that and I sold it and I
[62:38] thought I was the most brilliant Trader
[62:39] of all time right well now if you look
[62:41] back that you go well that was stupid
[62:44] right like I had no idea what I owned I
[62:46] saw it in a newspaper article of all
[62:48] places and so I got a coinbase account
[62:51] and I was able to buy it and you know I
[62:52] made the joke with my dad going well
[62:54] maybe we should just buy a thousand of
[62:55] these and see what happens you know and
[62:57] we didn't but you know like everyone
[63:00] gets into that cycle where you think
[63:01] you're a Trader first and you think
[63:03] that's what making money means and over
[63:07] time you realize that you know there's a
[63:09] reason why people always say the dead
[63:10] man portfolio performs the best right it
[63:13] takes all the emotion out of it you're
[63:15] buying things that you're comfortable
[63:16] and holding for a long time period and
[63:19] you just let time and adoption Trends
[63:22] take care of everything for you right
[63:23] that's the better way to invest but
[63:26] everyone always starts as a Trader some
[63:28] people are very skilled at trading and
[63:30] others aren't most people get really
[63:32] emotional about trades and it causes
[63:35] them to enter and exit at really bad
[63:37] times right you'll only buy into
[63:39] something when it's really exciting and
[63:41] the price has been running and you see
[63:42] everybody else making all this money but
[63:44] by then you're usually too late and then
[63:47] you'll sell out at the bottom when you
[63:49] can't take the losses anymore right and
[63:51] so you're in this Perpetual state of
[63:52] chasing things and capitulating on
[63:55] things
[63:56] when you find something you really do
[63:58] believe in you don't want to trade it
[64:00] you want to acquire it and then you want
[64:02] to hold it for a really long period of
[64:04] time and that's what's going to generate
[64:06] that excess value for you over time
[64:08] versus the people that you know get
[64:10] impatient and have to constantly be
[64:11] trading in and out of something because
[64:13] trying to time Cycles is it's tough work
[64:16] I know that bitcoin's been a pretty
[64:17] predictable four-year cycle but you do
[64:20] look at you know what does happen when
[64:23] that adoption curve really ramps up what
[64:25] does happen when all these big pools of
[64:27] capital come in when they're buyers that
[64:29] are agnostic to Cycles right they're
[64:32] accumulators they're holding it as a
[64:33] strategic asset that's a different kind
[64:35] of buyer than we've had in the last
[64:37] Cycles right just go back four years
[64:39] from now and how many new corporate
[64:42] entities and government entities and all
[64:44] these all these different entities and
[64:46] different pools of capital have entered
[64:48] into this Marketplace you know I always
[64:49] like to follow that Bitcoin treasuries
[64:52] website and the growth that's been in
[64:55] there is is just incredible the ETFs now
[64:58] exist those didn't used to be around
[64:59] like we are entering a different period
[65:02] with a different type of buyer that's
[65:04] entered the market I do think that has
[65:05] some impact on Cycles I'm not saying
[65:08] there won't be a cycle because I do
[65:11] believe those become a little
[65:12] self-fulfilling for a lot of people
[65:15] because bitcoin's price you know it
[65:16] trades at the margins right it's the
[65:18] Bitcoin that's moving and so if you've
[65:21] get this huge retail base that's decided
[65:24] that you know in October the Cycle's
[65:26] going to Peak and it's going to start
[65:28] coming down you'll definitely get people
[65:29] that are front running that just in case
[65:32] right but those aren't the people that
[65:34] really understand the value proposition
[65:35] of Bitcoin right I've rode this thing
[65:38] through several Cycles now right they
[65:40] don't bother me in the least because one
[65:42] they became very predictable so you knew
[65:44] what they looked like but two you see
[65:46] all the new entrance to the market and
[65:47] it's a different buyer profile and I
[65:49] think you have way more people with way
[65:51] more Capital today that are prepared to
[65:53] buy a dip than you had you know in the
[65:56] prior cycles that we've had so that
[65:58] profile is changing and I think with
[66:00] that will come some changes in the
[66:03] Cycles some people will still try to
[66:05] time it I'm just not going to be one of
[66:07] those people I know what I own I don't
[66:09] feel like giving it up I think it's got
[66:10] a really really long life ahead of it in
[66:14] terms of the adoption curve for Bitcoin
[66:16] and so the only thing I want to be doing
[66:18] is owning it and accumulating more of it
[66:20] that's my strategy I'm not going to
[66:22] trade it that's the best strategy
[66:24] probably you you can have for for the
[66:27] next like 10 20 years do do you see
[66:30] Bitcoin as a retirement tool as as like
[66:32] your retirement savings uh weic as your
[66:35] safe haven for when you're like 60 70 80
[66:39] years old at at one point absolutely
[66:42] yeah I think that that's kind of the the
[66:44] value floor for my portfolio is in
[66:47] Bitcoin and so I do view it as a savings
[66:51] vehicle for the future right I do think
[66:53] it's the best St of value that we have
[66:55] out there right now I also look at the
[66:58] development of the financial networks
[66:59] around it right right now bitcoin's been
[67:02] kind of siloed off from the traditional
[67:05] Financial Services right all the banks
[67:07] and all these other entities but that's
[67:08] going to change over time and when that
[67:11] changes you'll have different ways to
[67:14] access the value that you hold in that
[67:17] portfolio instead of just having to sell
[67:19] Bitcoin and be out of it so I look at
[67:23] that adoption as well going all these
[67:25] different Financial Services
[67:26] corporations when they get clearance
[67:28] from Regulators to get into this market
[67:30] and start developing products around
[67:32] this Market I think that it becomes a
[67:35] very flexible asset because it's the
[67:37] Best Collateral that you could hold if
[67:39] you're one of those
[67:40] institutions and so I feel very
[67:42] confident in holding this for a long
[67:44] period of time because I think it's just
[67:46] going to become more ingrained into the
[67:48] traditional Financial systems of the
[67:50] world which is going to make accessing
[67:52] the
[67:53] value and if I want to go trans act you
[67:56] know then I'll be able to maybe I can
[67:57] borrow against Bitcoin but I can get the
[67:59] money in US Dollars I can spend the US
[68:01] dollars but I'm still holding on to my
[68:03] Bitcoin and if that value keeps
[68:05] increasing you know then my loans
[68:07] essentially devaluing over time right I
[68:09] do see a lot of flexibility coming down
[68:12] the line for people like that so I think
[68:14] it's one of those assets you definitely
[68:16] want to own going into the future
[68:18] because when you're borrowing you're not
[68:20] getting taxed on that right that's a
[68:22] different setup for using that value
[68:24] versus selling it and if you sell it
[68:26] you're giving up all the appreciation
[68:28] that can come in the future on it so I
[68:30] view it as a very foundational savings
[68:33] technology for my own portfolio I'm very
[68:36] optimistic about the developments that
[68:38] are going to come and I do think it's
[68:40] going to ingrain itself more in the tra
[68:42] traditional Financial systems and I
[68:44] think that is important I know that
[68:46] Bitcoin was always this kind of
[68:48] rebellion asset for a very long time but
[68:50] I think when you're starting to look for
[68:52] the mass adoption aspects of Bitcoin you
[68:54] need to have services that feel familiar
[68:58] to most people and I think that's
[69:00] important to get them to participate in
[69:03] the network is to have a a service with
[69:06] entities that feel and look like what
[69:09] they're used to where they don't have to
[69:10] learn this entire new language to
[69:13] participate I I do think that's
[69:14] important I still think that being able
[69:17] to hold the asset on your own is one of
[69:18] the most important aspects of it but I'm
[69:20] not so myopic that I think that
[69:23] everybody is going to want to do that I
[69:26] I just don't believe everybody's going
[69:28] to go down the self- custody rabbit hole
[69:31] but once those Services come in and you
[69:33] can truly start to live your life on a
[69:35] Bitcoin standard I think that's a
[69:37] transformational shift that we don't
[69:39] have yet today we have a lot of services
[69:41] that are out there that focus on the
[69:43] savings aspect of Bitcoin right helping
[69:45] you get set up in multisig vaults and
[69:49] helping you get into a Bitcoin
[69:51] retirement account like a Bitcoin Ira
[69:53] like we have a lot of services coming
[69:54] out like that
[69:55] and we've got a few like strike that are
[69:58] now allowing you to do bill pay where
[70:00] you can hold all your assets in Bitcoin
[70:03] and then they'll sell a piece of it when
[70:05] the bill comes due and they take care of
[70:07] tracking all the taxes for you I think
[70:09] that's a big shift but nobody's fully
[70:12] connected that ecosystem yet right to
[70:14] make it where you've got a One-Stop shop
[70:17] for retail individuals to participate in
[70:20] the Bitcoin network from a retirement
[70:22] savings perspective from a savings
[70:24] account perspective I hold their
[70:26] checking account is Bitcoin pay their
[70:28] bills out of an account that's tied to
[70:29] bitcoin right that full cycle of how you
[70:33] live your financial life we're getting
[70:35] very close all these products are
[70:37] becoming very good but I'm still waiting
[70:40] to see which one connects the dots to
[70:43] make it so that you've got a One-Stop
[70:45] shop for an individual to participate in
[70:47] the Bitcoin ecosystem through the
[70:49] entirety of their financial life right
[70:52] everything from what they're spending
[70:53] today to how they're saving for
[70:55] near-term how they're saving for
[70:57] longterm and what they're putting in for
[70:58] retirement right I want to see that full
[71:01] connection and then you've got the
[71:02] borrowing aspect which is a little taboo
[71:05] because we had such a bad experience
[71:07] with that in the not so distant past
[71:10] right I mean a lot of us that were in
[71:12] here we probably got caught as well I
[71:14] did U and so you're trying to
[71:17] participate in this ecosystem but a lot
[71:19] of times it's been run by Bad actors
[71:20] which is the problem but I see that
[71:22] shifting and that shift away from the
[71:24] bad Act s where now you do have some
[71:27] regulation coming in that's going to
[71:29] prevent that type of activity you've got
[71:31] more public companies that have
[71:32] disclosures and audits when you start to
[71:35] see them participating in the ecosystem
[71:37] I think that people are going to feel
[71:38] much more comfortable adopting it into
[71:40] their own personal life so I think it's
[71:42] coming um but it's just going to take us
[71:44] a little bit absolutely and uh and you
[71:48] said the Rebellion story and it's really
[71:50] interesting because I think if we have
[71:53] this revolutionary story this Rebellion
[71:55] story um a part of that story has to be
[71:59] that traditional Financial space comes
[72:01] into the space and because if we're
[72:04] always just an outside thing there's
[72:07] never Rebellion there's never Revolution
[72:09] going on it's just ever it's always the
[72:11] it's just an outside thing then it's
[72:13] just I don't know what it is then we
[72:16] have to uh revolutionize we have to
[72:18] infiltrate the traditional Financial
[72:20] space so we have to have black rock uh
[72:24] coming into space we have to have all
[72:26] the ETFs and companies into the space
[72:29] and most importantly Bitcoin is for
[72:31] enemies like who who are we to decide
[72:33] who who adopts Bitcoin so like that that
[72:35] whole story like I don't buy like that's
[72:37] completely BS for me if like oh I don't
[72:39] like that black R is buying Bitcoin I
[72:41] don't like that everyone listens to
[72:43] Michael CA yeah like yeah Bitcoin is
[72:46] fies really it's the ultimate nod to
[72:48] success when they do start adopting
[72:50] right because their incentive structure
[72:52] is not aligned to welcome this asset in
[72:54] right
[72:55] when you look at all these Banks Bitcoin
[72:57] is not what they wanted but what it
[73:00] shows when they end up having to adopt
[73:02] it is that we were right and now that
[73:05] value propositions become so loud that
[73:08] they're forced to participate right
[73:10] whereas before they resisted right they
[73:13] resisted they lobbied they put all kinds
[73:15] of money behind trying to stop it none
[73:17] of it worked right the greatest
[73:18] Transformations are going to happen
[73:20] through some acts of rebellion Bitcoin
[73:22] is going to be no different right it
[73:24] started with the this underground
[73:25] shadowy group and everyone thought that
[73:27] they were you know crazy and it was only
[73:29] for criminals and blah blah and all
[73:31] you're realizing is that some of those
[73:33] people are the ones that see the value
[73:35] first right before anyone else is
[73:37] willing to and so when all the
[73:39] institutions are slanted towards keeping
[73:41] this asset out and now within just a
[73:45] period of what 15 years it's in and they
[73:48] have to capitulate and say well this is
[73:50] going to be a part of the financial
[73:51] framework of
[73:53] society what a victory right I mean I
[73:56] don't think people realize how big of a
[73:57] deal that is for these types of
[73:59] companies to have to start actively
[74:01] looking to participate in this network
[74:03] it is the ultimate sign that it's
[74:05] succeeding and that they now have no
[74:07] other choice but to participate or be
[74:09] left behind and so it's really a big
[74:12] victory I know it's not always going to
[74:14] feel like it for some of the really
[74:15] early adopters they wanted it to stay
[74:17] this you know Cipher Punk asset but you
[74:20] know when you do give a gift like this
[74:22] to the world and you walk away you don't
[74:24] get to ring its utilization anymore
[74:26] right it's up to the world now to evolve
[74:28] around this asset and take all the
[74:30] qualities and it's up to us as a
[74:32] community to help people to understand
[74:35] what the value proposition is in those
[74:37] qualities and how to participate in it
[74:39] in a maximal way that I think that that
[74:42] gives us a lot of purpose moving forward
[74:45] to make sure that we continue to get
[74:46] that message out there we continue to
[74:49] keep pushing this thing forward and we
[74:51] continue to keep an eye on these
[74:53] institutions in the way that they're
[74:54] going to participate at so that if it's
[74:56] going in a direction that you know
[74:58] people don't like it's all about the
[74:59] messaging getting that message out early
[75:01] making people understand what's either
[75:04] good about this or what's dangerous
[75:05] about this and how you keep your
[75:08] sovereignty versus how you're giving it
[75:10] up sometimes if you're not willing to do
[75:11] things like self- custody right there's
[75:13] a big story that's out there here and
[75:16] every individual is going to figure out
[75:17] how it ingrains into the fabric of their
[75:19] own life and from that perspective
[75:22] everyone can move forward utiliz the
[75:25] value that this asset brings to the
[75:26] world so it's exciting times that we're
[75:28] in nothing's going to be boring in the
[75:30] next decade absolutely um I wanted to
[75:33] talk way more about micro strategy but
[75:36] we kind of got sidetracked by that a lot
[75:39] of other discussions uh one thing I want
[75:41] to ask about micro strategy like
[75:44] indirectly about micro strategies um
[75:47] they kind of put a leverage play on on
[75:50] on bitcoin um do you recommend that on
[75:53] individual level to a lot of people came
[75:56] like oh I also have income I also want
[75:58] to play this micro strategy game but
[76:02] yeah like convertible noes as you
[76:04] already mentioned is a little bit
[76:05] different than like the usual consumer
[76:07] Dept how do you approach uh the micro
[76:10] strategy strategy on an individual uh
[76:13] level yeah so I'm usually not a big
[76:16] proponent of people taking out more debt
[76:18] in their personal lives I know that's
[76:20] kind of become a big thing and even
[76:21] sailor said it right like go mortgage
[76:23] your house up buy more Bitcoin right and
[76:25] historically he's been correct right no
[76:27] doubt about it the thing that I found is
[76:31] there's a part of your life where you
[76:33] need peace once in a while and if you're
[76:36] really leveraging yourself up you're
[76:39] really exposed to movements in the
[76:41] market and the problem is there's going
[76:43] to be a lot of people that aren't really
[76:45] in a position to leverage themselves up
[76:47] that are going to try to do it thinking
[76:49] that they're going to beat the market
[76:51] and when that happens and you're taking
[76:53] out that traditional debt you know like
[76:56] I said sometimes that does come with
[76:57] triggers that can cause things like
[76:59] liquidations it all depends on where
[77:01] you're borrowing it what type of assets
[77:02] you're borrowing against you know how
[77:04] those are secured so I think peace of
[77:08] mind is also very valuable right while
[77:10] Bitcoins the ultimate store of value
[77:12] your mental sanity is also very
[77:15] important so I'm never out there telling
[77:18] people to go lever themselves up and try
[77:21] to buy more Bitcoin with it because I
[77:23] think that debt in our
[77:25] Society is can be really dangerous for
[77:28] people and some people will get to the
[77:30] point where now they're living their
[77:32] life kind of on the razor's Edge where
[77:34] if something goes wrong and your job
[77:35] gets downsized and you lost the income
[77:37] that you had to support that debt now
[77:40] you're you know out there selling off
[77:41] your assets trying to recover and and
[77:43] stabilize yourself and I think that you
[77:47] need to have yourself freed up from some
[77:49] of those burdens to really be able to
[77:52] enjoy life around you to be able to
[77:54] weather the storms when they come you
[77:56] know if you don't have any of those
[77:58] points of weakness in your life things
[78:01] get really stable and you don't need to
[78:04] you know be so concerned all the time
[78:06] and I think that that's worth a lot so
[78:09] mathematically is it a good strategy
[78:11] yeah probably right I mean again if the
[78:13] debts devaluing over time yeah
[78:16] financially it's probably a good
[78:17] strategy but I I try to balance you know
[78:21] pure mathematics against mental Clarity
[78:25] stability in your own life keeping
[78:28] yourself in a good head space because I
[78:30] I think if you keep your mind in a good
[78:32] place you're free to make the B best
[78:35] decisions you can and you're not
[78:36] reacting to things anymore right so so
[78:40] no I I personally am not a proponent of
[78:42] Levering up and taking on a bunch of
[78:44] Consumer Debt and doing all these things
[78:45] to buy Bitcoin I just I see too many
[78:48] scenarios where people aren't actually
[78:50] prepared for what that means in their
[78:52] life and they're going to spend far too
[78:54] much time having to monitor that and
[78:57] make sure they've got the right cash
[78:58] flow coming in and they're going to try
[79:00] to lever up as much as they possibly can
[79:02] because they've they've heard that
[79:03] narrative I just think that from an
[79:05] emotional state perspective it's it it's
[79:09] a little dangerous for most people to
[79:11] adopt if you're doing it well within
[79:13] your means and you're trying to apply a
[79:15] little extra I don't have any issue with
[79:17] that and if you're someone that can
[79:18] handle it I mean great I mean have at it
[79:20] I'm not telling anyone what to do in
[79:23] that perspective but I just think for
[79:24] the bulk of people it'll end up being
[79:27] more stressful to them than it might be
[79:30] worth to them so I I don't do a lot of
[79:32] the the personal leverage stuff yeah
[79:35] peace of mind is the ultimate asset that
[79:38] that you can hold that that's like the
[79:40] time in your life that's even more
[79:41] valuable than Bitcoin itself exactly
[79:44] that's why I own micro strategy right
[79:45] I'll let him do all the leveraged plays
[79:48] for me right he's got access to
[79:49] different tools than I have his tools
[79:51] are non recourse most of mine would not
[79:54] be right so you know that there's some
[79:56] differences in structure there that make
[79:58] a difference but I I do the leveraged
[80:01] part in my investing life I'm just not
[80:04] going to go and uh overlover myself you
[80:06] know doing you know cash advances and
[80:09] remortgaging up my house and trying to
[80:11] find every asset I own that I can borrow
[80:12] money against that's that's just not my
[80:14] Approach I like stability I try to live
[80:16] a very calm peaceful existence in my own
[80:19] life so I I just stay away from it which
[80:22] brings me to one more topic uh it's uh
[80:25] time preference and you mentioned it I
[80:27] think in the beginning of the show where
[80:28] you said like oh people want 2,000% next
[80:31] week in some Assets Now we have Bitcoin
[80:34] which gives you the Peace of Mind gives
[80:36] you still a lot of uh growth but uh in a
[80:39] very safe manner what do you think is
[80:42] the global impact of Bitcoin on our
[80:46] society if actually has this mainstream
[80:48] adoption if we actually have a huge
[80:51] penetration point and we kind of switch
[80:53] that time pref reference around or is it
[80:56] just money and it doesn't really change
[80:58] a whole lot in society Society is always
[81:00] very interesting right CU we're we're
[81:02] very shortterm incentive driven and that
[81:05] comes to us from all different angles
[81:07] right we've always had within our
[81:09] careers you're always looking at one-ear
[81:12] Cycles on the long end before you're
[81:14] getting to where you need to be focusing
[81:16] on trying to get that next raise right
[81:18] you're trying to make your case for your
[81:19] bonus and so you're constantly aligning
[81:22] your life to that cycle because it's a
[81:24] in ask you personally when you look at
[81:26] corporations corporations are always
[81:28] tied to the next quarter's earnings so
[81:30] they have to be very short-term focused
[81:32] in nature because they're trying to
[81:33] engineer the best outcome over a
[81:36] three-month period so in the financial
[81:39] world everything in our lives has been
[81:41] geared around short-term success right
[81:44] it's how we measure success these days
[81:47] getting people to think long term about
[81:50] their savings activities is going to be
[81:52] a journey I'm I'm not under any uh
[81:55] disillusion here that Bitcoin is going
[81:57] to immediately fix that I do think that
[81:59] you're still going to get the Mania
[82:01] component of Bitcoin where everyone's
[82:02] coming in thinking they're going to get
[82:04] rich quick on it right I do think that
[82:06] that's probably going to be a part of
[82:07] that adoption story but it's going to
[82:10] come with that adoption curve on the
[82:12] education side as well where I think
[82:15] over time people's mindsets going to
[82:17] change on that and when you get one
[82:19] asset like Bitcoin that you can focus on
[82:23] the stability aspect of your savings
[82:25] journey into I think that that'll make
[82:27] it a little easier for people to shift
[82:30] their mindsets into all right this is
[82:31] focused on long-term value
[82:34] preservation right you can still have
[82:36] the other aspects of your portfolio
[82:38] where you're trying for you know
[82:39] short-term gains right there's a lot of
[82:41] ways to scratch that itch out there in
[82:43] the financial markets but once people
[82:46] get into Bitcoin and they start to
[82:49] really learn about what it is that they
[82:50] have and this is going to speed up
[82:52] because mainstream media is going to
[82:54] start really talking about Bitcoin and
[82:57] over time that message is going to get
[83:00] refined around the value preservation
[83:02] aspects of Bitcoin and I I think people
[83:05] will start to shift their mindset
[83:07] towards being more forward-looking
[83:09] because I think they'll be able to once
[83:12] you finally start preserving your value
[83:14] in an asset like Bitcoin and you start
[83:16] getting that cushion in your life where
[83:18] you can breathe and you can decompress
[83:20] for a second because you're not in this
[83:21] constant state of financial Panic now
[83:24] you get the ability to start looking
[83:26] further out into the future and I think
[83:29] that that's going to be one of the most
[83:30] important aspects that Bitcoin brings
[83:32] back to humanity is that long-term
[83:35] Outlook right the ability to actually be
[83:37] optimistic looking out into the future
[83:40] and seeing there being some brighter
[83:42] spots out there ahead of you versus
[83:44] right now where you just have to be
[83:45] heads down and making sure you're secure
[83:47] for next week or two weeks from now you
[83:49] know that's a shift so I think bitcoin's
[83:51] going to bring that level of Liberation
[83:54] to aot lot of people's lives that don't
[83:55] have it today so I think it's going to
[83:57] be very very important to people's
[84:00] Journey when they start participating in
[84:02] Bitcoin to take the moment to understand
[84:05] what it is that they're getting into and
[84:07] to figure out that Bitcoin isn't a
[84:09] tomorrow asset or a next week asset it's
[84:11] a next decade asset it's a next
[84:13] millennium asset and once they get that
[84:16] mind shift in there I think it'll become
[84:18] much easier for people to start focusing
[84:20] on the future again I love that yeah um
[84:23] I have one question to ask each and
[84:25] every one of my guests and the question
[84:26] is what can we learn from you besides
[84:29] Bitcoin so the thing that I hope people
[84:32] learn the most from me whether they you
[84:34] know watch my videos or they're watching
[84:36] my posts is I hope they learn the
[84:39] freedom to allow themselves to think
[84:41] differently than other people we we've
[84:43] gotten into a big period of group think
[84:46] in the world where we get our
[84:48] information and sound bites and what
[84:50] that does very quickly is it dissolves
[84:52] your own personal Cur Curiosities for
[84:56] every aspect of your life and so one of
[84:58] the core things that I try to always
[85:00] focus on is taking any topic that I see
[85:03] out there and I try to take all the
[85:06] other opinions off the table just don't
[85:08] even look at them and try to evaluate it
[85:09] just objectively from my own life
[85:12] experiences right we all have our
[85:14] thought processes that are learned based
[85:16] on how our life has evolved to this
[85:19] point and I think that that's a really
[85:21] good gift that the world gives us
[85:23] because it brings us so many different
[85:24] outlooks and when you get groups of
[85:26] people that are willing to look at the
[85:28] world differently and envision different
[85:31] futures for the world I think that you
[85:33] get into some really powerful
[85:35] discussions out there in the world where
[85:37] you're not doing it through any types of
[85:39] motive it's just through an intellectual
[85:42] pursuit of curiosity and knowledge and
[85:45] you find the right people that help to
[85:48] guide down that Journey so anytime that
[85:51] people can evaluate their life and find
[85:53] the areas where they're not thinking
[85:55] differently anymore and they've just
[85:57] started to accept things if you can
[86:00] re-evaluate that and change your mindset
[86:02] again you think differently and you'll
[86:04] get different outcomes so that that's
[86:06] the thing I hope people take away when
[86:08] they when they watch what I do is just
[86:09] the approach to trying to take that
[86:12] independent thought process and run with
[86:14] that Ah that's beautiful uh I love that
[86:17] a lot that think differently and make
[86:20] make you think it's also uh I mean uh we
[86:23] already kind of the end of the podcast
[86:25] but I just want to get that in uh
[86:26] Bitcoin was for me the moment where I
[86:29] started uh rethinking things that I
[86:32] thought to be true before because all of
[86:34] the sudden one major thing broke in my
[86:37] mind of like central banks and I had
[86:40] this mindset of like you inflation is
[86:42] good we need inflation to power up the
[86:44] economy I had that in my mind and once
[86:47] that broke I was like oh like what else
[86:50] and it it kind of triggers you down to
[86:52] really rethink uh things and different
[86:55] people have different um trigger events
[86:57] for that but I see that a lot of people
[87:00] come into that because of Bitcoin that's
[87:02] that's pretty beautiful that yeah you
[87:04] you need a big idea like Bitcoin to to
[87:07] force you into that mind space right
[87:09] until you see something that that goes
[87:11] against the status quo for everybody
[87:13] else and you start to evaluate it and
[87:15] you come to your own conclusion on it
[87:17] you got you've got to break out of the
[87:19] cycle right it becomes much easier in
[87:21] your life to accept what everybody else
[87:23] tells you as fact than it is to spend
[87:26] the time to really think about it and
[87:28] analyze it and come up with a conclusion
[87:30] for yourself but Bitcoin emerging onto
[87:32] the scene and seeing the growth
[87:34] trajectory that it took and starting to
[87:36] see the different use cases and how it
[87:38] changes storing your value I mean that
[87:41] that's been very impactful I think to a
[87:42] lot of people and that was kind of the
[87:43] springboard to go well you know what
[87:45] else have I accepted as normal that's
[87:47] crazy right that I really shouldn't
[87:49] accept as normal and now people get to
[87:51] think about that more which I think is a
[87:53] beautiful gift amazing our end routine
[87:55] of the podcast is where the previous
[87:57] guest is asking a question for the next
[87:59] guest without knowing who the next guest
[88:00] actually is um and the previous guest uh
[88:03] asked you the question which person in
[88:06] Bitcoin or outside of Bitcoin had the
[88:08] biggest impact on the Bitcoin adoption
[88:10] so far oh man it's interesting because
[88:13] it it's taken so many turns for me so
[88:15] you know you get all the normal people
[88:17] like safety and and the books that he
[88:19] wrote that really changed the way that
[88:21] you were willing to think and then you
[88:23] get to people like
[88:24] sailor who completely changed your mind
[88:27] on how to utilize the capital markets as
[88:31] it pertains to bitcoin but you know I I
[88:34] think I'm going to have to say safe
[88:35] deine was was really the first one that
[88:37] changed my mind in a big way right I
[88:40] think that his books have been really
[88:42] impactful in helping people to think
[88:45] different and to think of different
