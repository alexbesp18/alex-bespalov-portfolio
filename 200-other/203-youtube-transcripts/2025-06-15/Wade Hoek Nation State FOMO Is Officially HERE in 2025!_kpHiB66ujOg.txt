[00:00] Bitcoin is going to reduce the size of
[00:02] government the future is Bitcoin what
[00:04] would happen if he just said okay you're
[00:05] not fired I'm just closing down the FED
[00:07] all of these things are on the table if
[00:09] he comes in with an executive order to
[00:10] buy some Bitcoin right off the bat and
[00:12] then he works towards moving Senator
[00:14] lem's Bill forward and passes that 90
[00:16] days all bets are off the whole world is
[00:19] going to change it's almost like this
[00:21] golden window of opportunity for for
[00:24] Bitcoin and it's always feel like a a
[00:26] cold war where the different players are
[00:28] sitting and we're kind of waiting who's
[00:30] the first one to press the the button
[00:31] and buy as much Bitcoin as they can if
[00:34] the federal government needs to generate
[00:36] Bitcoin they're going to have to create
[00:37] value they have to work really hard to
[00:39] obtain Bitcoin and they're going to be
[00:41] competing with other nations to obtain
[00:43] that Bitcoin they're less incentivized
[00:45] to go to war with other nations that the
[00:47] federal government itself can't maintain
[00:49] its current size the the Great
[00:51] Depression was caused by the money
[00:53] printer so are the great Wars they're
[00:55] caused by the money printer without the
[00:57] money printer you won't have great Wars
[01:01] [Music]
[01:04] you in uh where you ataska you said
[01:08] correct I'm in Juno uh the capital uh
[01:11] it's a probably the smallest capital in
[01:13] the country we've got about 30,000
[01:14] people 40 miles of Road no roads in or
[01:17] out of Juno so it's it's
[01:19] Unique uh mostly government workers here
[01:22] in Juno so yeah it's a beautiful area
[01:26] located in Southeast Alaska so and your
[01:29] just said also that you're working with
[01:31] the state uh legislature what are you
[01:33] doing there correct I work in it for the
[01:36] Alaska state legislature okay so so not
[01:38] on the legislation side where you push
[01:41] Bitcoin or something like that no it on
[01:44] the legislative side I I know everybody
[01:46] across the way but I don't work in
[01:49] policy I'm on the agency side so I
[01:51] support the political side make sure
[01:53] their day-to-day operations are they're
[01:55] functional it gives me good
[01:56] opportunities to meet and and have
[01:58] conversations with different people
[02:00] across the way I learn a lot about
[02:03] policy and they learn a lot from me
[02:05] interesting yeah that that's really cool
[02:08] um and you're also an veteran uh there's
[02:12] a there's a whole podcast around that
[02:13] like Bitcoin veterans I had someone on
[02:16] there how is it called Bitcoin veterans
[02:18] is that is that the name do you know
[02:19] about it it's yes I'm a member of
[02:21] Bitcoin veterans um we have uh it
[02:25] started out with just a few people there
[02:27] was the primary pod and podcast group
[02:30] so as soon as Bitcoin veterans kicked
[02:32] off I remember Alex stanic launching it
[02:35] off announcing it on Cafe B he didn't
[02:37] launch it but he announced it on Cafe B
[02:38] so I hopped right on board and we
[02:40] started a whole bunch of channels on
[02:41] Signal groups uh everything everything
[02:44] having to do with from Regional chat
[02:47] groups for uh veterans who are
[02:49] bitcoiners to we have groups from
[02:51] Regional chat groups to uh we have a
[02:53] Pilots group we have a group on people
[02:55] who are building out different
[02:56] communities in their areas we have uh
[02:59] Radio Chat we have cyber security and
[03:01] operational security so we we took our
[03:04] uh expertise from being in the military
[03:06] and we um brought them to a group
[03:10] outside the military so we still retain
[03:12] that camaraderie that we had in the
[03:13] military as people get out and and in
[03:16] veterans communicate a little
[03:17] differently than the normal normal
[03:19] average person so so and we're a little
[03:22] more Mission driven so we're able to
[03:26] build out things I don't know uh
[03:28] differently sometimes better um because
[03:31] we have a leadership structure not
[03:33] necessarily in the groups but we
[03:35] understand I guess the Brotherhood of
[03:36] being in the military Brotherhood
[03:38] Sisterhood of being in the military so
[03:41] yeah we had a great event in Nashville
[03:43] at the Bitcoin 2024 conference we had a
[03:45] breakout room 3,000 square feet we had
[03:47] everything from uh people teaching
[03:50] Bitcoin mining to uh mesh tastic radios
[03:53] to uh Travis West did a presentation on
[03:58] the blockchain Max K came down and spoke
[04:01] on our stage and yeah it was just
[04:04] Nashville was incredible for Bitcoin
[04:07] veterans but we're we're continuing to
[04:09] build so I expect great things from the
[04:12] community because as it grows we we
[04:15] encourage each other we help each other
[04:16] with our different projects so if you're
[04:19] if you're a veteran and you're dabbling
[04:21] in Bitcoin you're starting to try to
[04:23] understand it or you're you've been in
[04:24] the community for a while but you're
[04:26] haven't joined our group yet I I
[04:28] strongly suggest people come on over
[04:29] over and then we have all these other
[04:31] subgroups within Bitcoin veterans like
[04:34] Scott Lindberg with free market kids
[04:36] who's a Bitcoin veteran um Gabe Lord
[04:38] with operation Bitcoin he's a Bitcoin
[04:40] veteran uh Bitcoin Alaska that's me
[04:43] Bitcoin veteran so we have all these
[04:45] adjacent groups also me Scott and Gabe
[04:47] are also me Premier Bitcoin light nodes
[04:49] so we teach the curriculum as well
[04:52] so yeah really cool I love that expect a
[04:56] lot of great things coming from Bitcoin
[04:57] veterans and and we're putting on this
[04:59] uh Bitcoin Alaska conference that's put
[05:01] on by Bitcoin veterans so oh I like it
[05:05] uh Alaska is kind of above Canada or
[05:08] next to Canada if I if I'm
[05:11] correct correct we
[05:13] are if if you could drive over the ice
[05:16] field we're about 20 30 miles from
[05:18] Canada here in Juno so it's just a
[05:20] little Panhandle on the south side of
[05:23] Alaska so we're right next door but it
[05:26] it's a little bit longer of a ride
[05:28] because you have to take a ferry out of
[05:30] Juno or take a plane and then drive
[05:31] across the border to get there oh okay
[05:35] interesting yeah just like geographical
[05:37] for me that's new areas I think I never
[05:40] I think I never spoke with anyone from
[05:42] Alaska directly like someone this
[05:45] actually uh there it's it's always like
[05:48] the the that region that you're like I
[05:50] know uh South America I know uh know
[05:54] America the United States and know
[05:56] Canada and know Mexico and all those
[05:58] things but Alaska is kind of like yeah I
[06:01] know that it's somewhere there but I
[06:02] never really hear anything from there
[06:05] how many people are there actually uh
[06:07] six to 700,000 people total population
[06:09] Juno has 30,000 so most of the
[06:12] population lives up in the Anchorage
[06:13] area up in the there's like like half a
[06:17] million like 600,000 people there
[06:19] interesting that it's so it's like half
[06:22] of Vienna that that that's but it's way
[06:25] bigger than Vienna right the the area is
[06:27] is is quite big it's about a third of
[06:30] the side of the size of the US so a lot
[06:33] of L
[06:34] wow so like that's like a small uh
[06:38] Village and then there's like very long
[06:40] nothing is is that how it's structured
[06:44] yeah and most of the land up here is
[06:46] managed by the federal government it's
[06:47] one of the things I like about Bitcoin
[06:49] is you know it I believe it's going to
[06:53] reduce the size of government and as it
[06:55] reduces the size of government things
[06:57] like uh Federal management of lands will
[07:00] will cease and states will have more
[07:02] control over their lands I I'm I'm a
[07:05] strong believer in local and local
[07:06] government and state government and
[07:08] people closer to government should make
[07:10] policy around their regions
[07:12] so I enjoy the fact that you know Alaska
[07:15] being so heavily controlled by the
[07:18] federal government eventually it being
[07:19] able to break down too so that so that
[07:21] people in in Alaska can take advantage
[07:23] of the resources that we have in in the
[07:25] land that we have here interesting uh
[07:28] how how big of a topic is it in Alaska
[07:31] uh the the Bitcoin topic and the Meetup
[07:33] scene and stuff like that it started
[07:36] with when when I got started in Bitcoin
[07:38] back in 2014 2015 2015 is when I I
[07:43] really just started diving in there was
[07:45] nobody I've met a couple people who who
[07:49] were into Bitcoin got into Bitcoin
[07:51] around the same time as me but it didn't
[07:54] really kick off here in Juno until I I
[07:56] started having meetups um a lady came to
[07:59] me and asked me if I could educate her
[08:01] so she could talk to her friends about
[08:03] it and I and then she come back to me
[08:05] with questions and I just told her that
[08:07] wasn't going to work just have everybody
[08:08] come to my house and it's grown ever
[08:10] since now it's now I've I've talked to
[08:14] you know we had weekly meetings for a
[08:16] couple years I've spoken at different
[08:19] local events uh and talk and and when
[08:22] you're speaking at these events I don't
[08:23] mean like going up and giving
[08:24] presentations these are more hostile uh
[08:27] people who who will launch questions at
[08:30] you out of the from left field and you
[08:32] just have to address them so it's it's
[08:34] more challenging than just you know
[08:36] being on a pod you know this is fun but
[08:39] when you're in front of a hundred people
[08:41] who are just bombarding you with well
[08:43] what about gold and it's digital what if
[08:46] you know power is knocked out like and
[08:47] you're just being blindsided that's
[08:50] that's challenging um I really enjoy
[08:52] those too but now we're there's probably
[08:56] I probably I've directly orange filled
[08:58] probably about 40 people here in you
[08:59] know so out of 30,000 people that's not
[09:02] bad um but now in the Capitol Building
[09:05] everybody knows I'm a bit coiner you
[09:08] know I I make it known I I'm a Target
[09:11] but at the same time I I when I got into
[09:14] this I really wanted to make sure that
[09:15] when people had questions they didn't go
[09:17] to bad sources and that's one of the
[09:20] reasons why I started teaching people
[09:22] was there so much bad content out there
[09:24] and I got tired of people going to you
[09:27] know every four years you know the cycle
[09:30] it's it's those all those altcoins pop
[09:32] up and all the frauds come out and I
[09:34] really wanted to make sure that the
[09:35] people here didn't get um get attacked
[09:39] by by these groups um by all the big
[09:42] money that's flowing into all these
[09:44] other entities
[09:46] so I I I just I launched a website and I
[09:49] started putting up content you know
[09:50] videos of podcasters and speakers and
[09:54] people you know people who we all know
[09:56] really well mer sailor you know people
[09:58] who are really down the rout hole and
[10:00] and can guide people in the right
[10:02] direction and that helped a lot we'd
[10:05] spent a lot of time at the house
[10:06] watching those videos but now because of
[10:08] that people come to me with my opinion
[10:11] and um also come to me asking where to
[10:14] find you know whatever information on
[10:17] whatever question that they have so it's
[10:19] really helpful especially places like
[10:22] the Capitol building where you know I'm
[10:24] wandering the hall I was in the elevator
[10:25] with a security guard the other day and
[10:28] they started H hitting me up because
[10:29] they're a veteran and had a bunch of
[10:31] questions and so my role here at the
[10:34] Alaska state legislature is it but I I'm
[10:37] a bitcoiner and I don't hide it so you
[10:40] know just like and and the way I see it
[10:42] is while I'm non-political and I don't
[10:44] take a political side left or right of
[10:48] anything if I'm a boter I'm going to
[10:50] talk about voting I me am a Boer I love
[10:52] to fish but also if I I'm a bitcoiner
[10:56] and if you want to talk about that topic
[10:58] I'm more than happy to sit down with
[10:59] anybody in the capital building and have
[11:01] the conversation off hours of course so
[11:04] I look forward to those conversations
[11:06] this year's because they're they're
[11:07] they're gonna I have a feeling there's
[11:09] going to be a lot of people with a lot
[11:10] of
[11:10] questions yeah and I feel like your
[11:13] actual role in there is Bitcoin and not
[11:16] it like inofficial
[11:18] role well unofficially I talk about what
[11:20] I like to talk about right so so if I'm
[11:23] doing updates on your
[11:26] machine no then you can I
[11:29] um uh I don't know what exactly you're
[11:32] doing but I was actually uh in civil
[11:35] service and there I quickly the thing
[11:38] got around that I'm good with computers
[11:40] so I was half time actually the IT guy
[11:44] and half time I was the actual Civil
[11:46] Service who does things with kids and
[11:48] and all the things um so it was also fun
[11:51] for me I had a own car and drove around
[11:54] the country and just like switched PCS
[11:57] updated stuff and and stuff like that
[11:59] that um so I know there's a lot of time
[12:02] in between if you handle someone to to
[12:04] talk with them and this was also the
[12:05] time where I was slowly getting into
[12:07] Bitcoin and it was a fun time to orange
[12:09] pill
[12:11] organizations while they have to wait
[12:13] for your computer to update exactly we
[12:17] have them hostage right they you know
[12:20] and you can only move so fast you you
[12:22] got to wait for the bar to go across the
[12:23] screen so yeah do you have to talk
[12:26] something uh then let's let's use the
[12:28] time Bitcoin but that's really that's
[12:31] that's exactly the Grassroots movement
[12:33] that that we need people that uh just do
[12:36] uh that job and next to that there are
[12:39] the Bitcoin uh soldiers in in the field
[12:42] the Bitcoin veterans uh that are really
[12:45] trying to orange pill the world one by
[12:47] one and just trying to educate the
[12:49] people that around you and ask and in
[12:51] get getting to that um like that's the
[12:55] the actual Bitcoin war zone if you like
[12:57] to have like 50 people in front of few
[12:59] who say like oh but isn't it volatile
[13:01] isn't it bad for the environment isn't
[13:03] it that and that so that that's kind of
[13:06] the the real being orange build because
[13:09] this is like really comfortable I I only
[13:12] invite bitcoiners it's like I can do
[13:14] this every day I know where where what
[13:16] I'm getting into that's like really a
[13:18] com environment but getting out there
[13:20] and speaking with the people that are
[13:22] not already kind of orange bued that's
[13:25] the that's the that's the hard work and
[13:27] I really appreciate uh you doing that
[13:30] yeah the the nice thing about Alaska too
[13:32] is while well the legislative body they
[13:36] they don't understand it yet they'll get
[13:37] there I I have faith that they'll get
[13:39] there I hope they'll get there the um
[13:41] but we have Micro grids all over Alaska
[13:44] so trying to have cheap energy is there
[13:47] is none in the remote areas so being
[13:49] able to uh have a buyer of Last Resort
[13:52] to be able to go in and mine Bitcoin
[13:55] or um these communities have don't have
[13:57] a lot of money so how can they generate
[14:00] Revenue while they're building out their
[14:02] energy
[14:03] infrastructure bitcoin's the answer for
[14:05] for so many things in Alaska um you look
[14:09] at the and then we have the Permanent
[14:10] Fund Court Permanent Fund Court manages
[14:13] $80 billion of money what how that works
[14:16] is back in the early 80s we started late
[14:19] 70s early 80s we started setting aside
[14:21] money a percentage of the money revenues
[14:24] generated from oil and minerals people
[14:27] think it's just oil it's not just oil
[14:29] it's it's resources resource extraction
[14:31] from Alaska so money set aside it's
[14:34] invested through the Permanent Fund Corp
[14:35] and then a Permanent Fund dividend gets
[14:37] paid out to the people across Alaska and
[14:40] a lot of people see that as a socialist
[14:42] type system but it's not because it's
[14:46] private entities extracting resources
[14:49] the money goes into a public corporation
[14:52] that then invests those monies and those
[14:53] revenues Drive profits that are paid
[14:56] back to alaskans to help people afford
[14:59] to live in
[15:00] Alaska but more recently with inflation
[15:04] the Permanent Fund can't afford to
[15:06] continue on paying the people the same
[15:10] amount of money and as Government grows
[15:12] government wants to utilize those funds
[15:15] in different
[15:16] ways so they're tapping into more and
[15:19] more of what people sometimes call the
[15:22] people's money there's a solution for
[15:24] all of this and it's frustrating knowing
[15:26] the solution and the solution is just
[15:28] simply Bitcoin
[15:29] the they need to if they were to invest
[15:33] in Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[15:36] infrastructure they could afford to and
[15:38] if they were
[15:39] to instead of taking a percentage of the
[15:42] revenues generated from extracting oil
[15:44] or minerals if they were to do the same
[15:46] thing with Bitcoin mining across the
[15:47] state we could generate Revenue in
[15:50] Bitcoin and pay Permanent Fund dividends
[15:52] in Bitcoin if we so choose it just it
[15:56] it's a paradigm it would be a paradigm
[15:57] shift for the state right now like ever
[16:00] since the early 80s we've been capping
[16:01] all our oil wells so there's something
[16:03] like 30 zatts or something that's a
[16:06] massive amount of natural gas that is in
[16:10] capped oil wells because we Cap all our
[16:12] wells and that requires maintenance to
[16:13] maintain those Wells um and and the
[16:16] government body has to Department of
[16:19] Division sorry Department of
[16:20] Environmental Conservation has to
[16:21] monitor those Wells so that's an expense
[16:23] on government so now if we were to mine
[16:26] Bitcoin on those capped Wells we'd
[16:28] generate Revenue as well as um income
[16:32] not only for a mining operation but also
[16:34] for the Permanent Fund Corp which then
[16:36] could benefit and help fund state
[16:38] government and build out the
[16:39] infrastructure of the state so the the
[16:41] answer is quite you know it I'd say
[16:44] quite simply but it would be very
[16:46] difficult to do but the future is
[16:48] Bitcoin and the future for Alaska is
[16:50] Bitcoin we have so much stranded energy
[16:53] from natural gas to uh Hydro here in
[16:57] southeast to GE Thal in mid mid Alaska
[17:01] um Central Alaska so there's so much
[17:03] opportunity here in Alaska I don't think
[17:04] there is much opportunity in any other
[17:07] US state not nearly as much as there is
[17:09] here in Alaska so that's why we're
[17:12] putting on the Bitcoin Alaska conference
[17:14] here in Juno is I I believe that policy
[17:16] is driven in this small area um with
[17:19] 30,000 people no roads out so we have a
[17:23] a locked in amount of people that can't
[17:26] escape so as we have this conference
[17:29] over the course of a week and bring in
[17:31] enough bitcoiners to actually start
[17:32] orange pilling the community I think
[17:34] it'll have an impact it'll drive across
[17:35] the
[17:37] state interesting there's a lot of
[17:40] nation state uh topics currently yeah
[17:44] especially with with Trump coming into
[17:45] office and talking about maybe he signs
[17:48] executive order or maybe he does it
[17:50] later with the bill uh and then bricks
[17:53] are talking about it even Russia is
[17:55] talking about it uh uh so how how is
[17:59] that looking like in Alaska is that a
[18:02] thing that is is possible that they're
[18:04] using that funds and maybe something
[18:07] else even uh has Alaska their own
[18:09] currencies sorry I have almost no zero
[18:12] knowledge about Alaska Alaska is a state
[18:15] so we have we use the US dollar um we
[18:18] have a one mining operation that I know
[18:21] of that's started uh that has started
[18:25] Bitcoin mining in the
[18:27] interior uh I think it's hildbrand cour
[18:29] hill hill courp under Jeff hildbrand I
[18:32] believe um and then I do know
[18:37] that I I do believe that he is Jeff
[18:40] hildbrand is friends with or or knows uh
[18:43] our Governor Mike Den Levy
[18:46] so there I believe that we are going in
[18:49] the direction of adopting Bitcoin across
[18:53] the state um at least at the same level
[18:56] as uh the next Administration does at
[18:58] the federal level
[18:59] so I look forward to this conference
[19:02] this year because I believe it's going
[19:03] to bring uh bipartisan people to the
[19:05] conference because policy will be driven
[19:07] towards uh Bitcoin here in the
[19:10] state interesting yeah yeah I was that
[19:13] that might might be uh bad for me to
[19:16] admit but I I was not aware that Alaska
[19:19] is a state of United
[19:21] States zero knowledge a lot of people uh
[19:26] in the US they didn't realize it up
[19:27] until recently it seems like back in the
[19:29] 80s I lived here in the early 80s and I
[19:31] moved away and that was the question I
[19:33] got in school down south and you know I
[19:35] moved from Alaska to New Mexico and
[19:37] nobody you know and the questions were
[19:39] do you live in an igloo it's no I live
[19:42] in a
[19:43] house it's a mile from an ice field yes
[19:46] but it's still a
[19:48] house what are this ice Fields is it
[19:52] really just like I is underneath uh a
[19:56] ground or is underneath water or like
[19:58] how does this look like it's it's a
[20:01] massive amount of ice that I believe is
[20:04] about a mile high and the as it pushes
[20:08] down it creates these glaciers or these
[20:09] rivers of ice that go out these valleys
[20:12] so and underneath it depending on I
[20:15] guess what the stage the Earth is in at
[20:17] the time but now it seems like we have
[20:19] more water running underneath the ice
[20:20] which is melting more of the ice but as
[20:24] the climate cools it's going to reverse
[20:26] that it just a matter of what cycle the
[20:28] Earth is in at the time interesting yeah
[20:32] I'm I'm sorry I'm so amazed with Alaska
[20:35] how to go focus on
[20:38] bitcoin that's why um so a lot of the
[20:40] conferences that people have across the
[20:42] world is you go to an area and you go
[20:44] into a convention center and that's what
[20:46] you do right that's the that was the
[20:49] conference but in Nashville the veterans
[20:52] we did something different we had like
[20:54] we had a range day we had a Bitcoin
[20:55] veterans run we had a party at a
[20:58] downtown Club CL we you know I went to
[21:00] Anders party which was great I'm so
[21:01] sorry to hear about what happened to his
[21:03] home in um uh California there his home
[21:07] was one of them that burned to the
[21:08] ground um he spectacular party there
[21:11] though in in Nashville and then uh our
[21:13] breakout room and then I went to uh
[21:16] Bitcoin and biscuits with lumus and
[21:20] vivec and a bunch of people that was fun
[21:23] but we had all these events that went on
[21:25] and a lot of these conference they have
[21:26] these oh yeah and the the unconference
[21:28] the me Premier Bitcoin on conference
[21:30] that was put on by veterans and uh me
[21:33] Premier Bitcoin but here in Juno I
[21:35] decided that I need to do something like
[21:37] that here so we're going to have the
[21:38] Vets run the range day I've got the
[21:40] native one people canoe Society is going
[21:42] to paddle us out to an area where we're
[21:44] going to have a dayong picnic on the
[21:46] beach and then for the well pass I I
[21:48] just didn't want to do anything do the
[21:50] same thing that they do in other places
[21:51] where you have a $3,000 really expensive
[21:54] exclusive seating you're near somebody
[21:55] well past so we chartered a 78t twostory
[21:59] catamaran to go up Tracy arm F this is
[22:02] where I'm going with this is is the
[22:03] glaciers so it's our all day cruise with
[22:06] the speakers locked in on the same boat
[22:08] with you so you can build relationships
[22:10] get to know the people who are coming to
[22:11] speak and go up and see the glaciers and
[22:14] the whales and the Bears and the goats
[22:16] and everything else so and then I priced
[22:18] that like 800 bucks I I I just wanted to
[22:21] get people on the boat to meet these
[22:23] people and enjoy Alaska and watch the
[22:24] hydro pouring off the mountain sides and
[22:26] talk Bitcoin mining I just think that's
[22:28] going to be so much better than sitting
[22:29] in a conference
[22:31] Hall that's amazing yeah I I love that
[22:34] and and 8 8800 bucks is that for the
[22:37] conference or is that another special
[22:39] tour the uh the regular conference is
[22:42] two days at the Centennial Hall Downtown
[22:44] that's 400 bucks but the whale pass
[22:46] includes the the general admission on
[22:49] top of going on the cruise so just it's
[22:51] a $400 Cruise here locally I just priced
[22:54] it in on top of the conference fee I
[22:57] love that really cool uh that that
[22:59] sounds like an amazing opportunity uh
[23:02] might even do that when when is that uh
[23:04] in in in 2025 uh the wh pass is July 3r
[23:08] but the conference all the satellite
[23:10] events begin July 1 and they're over on
[23:13] July 6 so you'd want to be here like
[23:15] June 30th to July 7th to get everything
[23:17] in
[23:18] there oh that's nicely after the Bitcoin
[23:21] 2095 uh event then

[23:31] speaker there uh and yeah I have to see
[23:35] it but uh it's it's something I will
[23:37] definitely look at if if I was not aware
[23:38] of of the conference but I will will see
[23:41] it it's probably like uh Bitcoin Alaska
[23:43] 2095 I can find it U Bitcoin alaska.org

[24:04] podcast uh
[24:06] it's uh that share that's quickly window
[24:11] tuck that that's probably it right yep
[24:14] that's it welcome to Juno
[24:17] perfect ah that looks so cool there's a
[24:20] a mountain pass and a whale
[24:23] pass see whales on our whale pass you'll
[24:26] have whales in inside the boat and
[24:27] outside we' got some good speakers we've
[24:29] got Alex gladstein coming up with human
[24:31] rights Foundation we've got Lisa Huff um
[24:34] the mother of Bitcoin um and uh Gabe
[24:38] Lord we've got uh Joe Kelly from
[24:41] Unchained we've got some really good
[24:43] speakers coming up for the conference
[24:45] yeah Lisa Lisa is great she was already
[24:47] two times on my podcast uh and she she
[24:50] she's a great speaker I love that love
[24:52] her really cool perfect but yeah uh
[24:55] let's get back to
[24:57] bitcoin so sorry for my short uh Alaska
[25:01] laugh here um you you said something
[25:03] interesting in a in a a sent that I just
[25:05] remembered you said uh you make yourself
[25:08] a Target or you're a Target because
[25:10] you're a Bitcoin or something something
[25:12] along this line I don't remember exactly
[25:14] what did you mean by that so when I
[25:17] first let everybody know I was a
[25:18] bitcoiner it seemed like you know on the
[25:21] job off the job wherever I was in the
[25:22] community people you know people had a
[25:24] different view of Bitcoin back way back
[25:27] when and so you we might get we might
[25:31] have been ridiculed to some degree
[25:33] laughed at but it's funny um over time
[25:37] that turned into you know some people
[25:40] asking questions while other people
[25:41] might Snicker off in a corner to now it
[25:43] seems like everybody just wants to ask
[25:45] questions so earlier on especially
[25:49] around
[25:50] 2020 people here had no clue what it was
[25:54] had no understanding of it and that's
[25:56] when we really began our local Meetup
[25:59] and
[26:00] now um you know one person at work would
[26:03] scream down the hall hey Bitcoin guy you
[26:05] know just kind of a derogatory tone like
[26:08] hey laugh at this guy but now it's just
[26:10] the opposite now the people who don't
[26:13] understand it are silent or they come
[26:15] and ask questions when they're ready so
[26:19] it it went from a a laughable topic to a
[26:22] serious
[26:23] topic so as a Target you know a few of
[26:26] us had to put ourselves out there um
[26:28] people who do pods people who who go
[26:30] about their daily lives and have those
[26:32] conversations with their family and
[26:33] their family might you know not
[26:35] understand it so their automatic
[26:38] reaction is whatever the mainstream news
[26:40] might have said about it at the time or
[26:42] oh it's magic internet money it's not
[26:44] backed by anything so I I can't believe
[26:47] this person's wasting their time just
[26:48] because they didn't have an
[26:49] understanding of it whereas now we're
[26:52] not a Target anymore we are the people
[26:54] that they turn to and it's those brave
[26:55] people who stood up and and explain the
[26:57] topic to people and have had those
[26:58] conversations and and weren't afraid of
[27:00] being laughed at who who those people
[27:02] are now turning to so it's nice to feel
[27:05] that that energy go from a negative
[27:07] energy to a positive energy from a an
[27:11] uneducated um conversation to a a let's
[27:16] dive deeper every time you have a
[27:17] conversation with somebody you go
[27:18] further down the rabbit hole and you
[27:19] take them on a journey further and and
[27:21] you figure out where they're at like if
[27:23] their interest is human rights and and
[27:25] they're looking at um tomr's videos you
[27:29] know you can turn them on to Alex
[27:30] gladstein or if they're interested in
[27:32] the National Security you can turn them
[27:34] on to you know Bitcoin veterans in our
[27:37] content or like there's all these
[27:40] different rabbit holes you can go down
[27:41] if they're interested in Mass migration
[27:43] you know that's a you can start breaking
[27:45] down how it will affect mass migration
[27:47] or how it will affect um um drugs and
[27:52] how they're distributed across the world
[27:54] and the contian effect and getting
[27:55] closer to the money printer and how the
[27:57] drugs flow into the us because we
[27:59] control the money printer and how if we
[28:02] don't control the money printer then
[28:03] those drugs won't be incentivized to
[28:05] flood our nation like there's all these
[28:07] different rabbit holes you can go down
[28:10] that that's really what I enjoy is going
[28:11] down those different rabbit holes and
[28:13] identifying where people are at where
[28:16] they're at in their life what is
[28:18] important to them are they a bartender
[28:20] who is just struggling dayto day and
[28:23] they want to have a way to to save money
[28:25] we'll tip in Bitcoin visit him a few
[28:26] times show them the number go up and
[28:29] then help him you know get an account
[28:31] with some company to purchase Bitcoin
[28:34] and then teach him self custody or are
[28:36] they
[28:37] a are they on the U human rights side
[28:41] and they just want to understand it more
[28:43] deeply on that level that I really enjoy
[28:46] the conversations and all the different
[28:48] directions they can go and where people
[28:49] are at and finding where that is and
[28:51] just just letting your mind go it's so
[28:54] novel that all of these topics are just
[28:57] they're fun I partnered up with coin
[29:01] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[29:03] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[29:06] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[29:09] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[29:12] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[29:15] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[29:18] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[29:20] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[29:24] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[29:26] and amazing ch Genesis edition of their
[29:30] watch collections you have the date of
[29:32] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[29:35] there and of course also the block
[29:38] height and which Epoch we are currently
[29:41] in I love the level of detail they put
[29:44] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[29:46] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[29:49] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[29:52] love those watches so so much if you
[29:55] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[29:57] regular basis I guess you already bought
[30:00] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[30:03] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[30:06] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[30:08] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[30:10] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[30:13] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[30:15] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[30:18] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[30:22] with the code Robin at the checkout
[30:24] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[30:28] your bitbox and the next step is to
[30:30] really level up your sovereignty as an
[30:32] individual you have to have the most
[30:35] secure self custody setup you have to
[30:37] secure your own devices you have to
[30:40] protect your privacy you have to set up
[30:43] an inheritance plan and depending on
[30:46] where you live you even want to have a
[30:48] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[30:51] in case something goes really really
[30:53] wrong and through all those steps the
[30:54] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[30:58] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[31:00] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[31:04] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[31:07] how you can level up your sovereignty I
[31:10] love that it's almost like this what you
[31:14] described of like not being a Target
[31:16] anymore it's more of like this career
[31:19] risk is also flippening all of the
[31:22] sudden uh politicians can speak up about
[31:24] it all of a sudden uh CEOs can speak up
[31:27] about it all those positions that
[31:29] previously were like only bitcoiners in
[31:32] their private life or not talking about
[31:35] anyone with Bitcoin but still being a
[31:36] bitcoiner now like oh like I'm a
[31:39] bitcoiner it's almost seems like it
[31:42] slowly slowly flips from not wanting to
[31:44] speak up to slowly slowly to getting to
[31:47] the point and I hope we will get there
[31:49] where if you are not a bitcoiner you're
[31:51] not cool like you you have you almost
[31:54] have to say that you're a bitcoiner to
[31:56] to to be in that cool club and we are
[31:59] slowly getting to that Spectrum uh and
[32:02] it's it's interesting and it's really
[32:04] fun to observe how how this flippening
[32:08] of The Narrative flippening of the
[32:09] career risk or being a Target and stuff
[32:11] like that uh is slowly slowly
[32:13] progressing and uh I think 2025 and the
[32:17] coming years will be huge in that
[32:19] transition I I love to see that yeah it
[32:23] I I feel it already you know
[32:26] it's we're already there in a lot of
[32:29] ways as far as topic and it will be more
[32:33] cool here in the next in the next month
[32:35] or so as the next Administration comes
[32:38] in as legislation's pushed and and
[32:42] people think that it it's amazing people
[32:45] still think that Bitcoin is kind of a
[32:47] political issue but it's really not it's
[32:49] bipartisan like sure one party may like
[32:52] it more than the other but that goes
[32:54] with any topic you can always count the
[32:56] votes on any topic but the both sides of
[32:59] Congress own Bitcoin you know it's the
[33:01] game theory playing out that we've been
[33:03] talking about for 10 years that as
[33:05] people said well the government will
[33:07] never accept it no the government won't
[33:09] accept it but all the members of the
[33:11] government will so the government will
[33:13] do whatever the government is not an
[33:15] entity it's not a life form it feels
[33:17] like it sometimes but it's not it's the
[33:19] people the individual people and they're
[33:21] incentivized to own it absolutely what
[33:23] do you expect from the the next
[33:26] Administration uh to do about Bitcoin uh
[33:29] Trump is sometimes like a cholly choker
[33:32] that is not 100% like uh we we know what
[33:35] we will do a lot of things are possible
[33:38] what do you expect from from that I
[33:41] expect a lot I it's really we live in
[33:44] really interesting times a lot of people
[33:45] will look back at this time and there's
[33:46] a lot of negativity in the world today
[33:48] more than there was in say the 80s it
[33:51] felt like a different world than back in
[33:52] the 1980s whereas now it seems like it's
[33:56] more hostile there's not there's not as
[33:58] much um building you know music's not
[34:01] the same TV is not the same but now with
[34:05] Bitcoin as it changes everything it's
[34:08] like I feel like this is more the Golden
[34:09] Age and we're going to go places that
[34:12] like I I just feel this year is a
[34:14] turning point it's going to be a big
[34:16] year with um Jay Powell coming out and
[34:19] saying he can't be fired I know Trump
[34:22] doesn't like to be challenged I don't
[34:24] know much about him but he does not like
[34:26] you know when you challenge him
[34:28] so what would happen if he just said
[34:30] okay you're not fired I'm just closing
[34:31] down the FED I mean all of these things
[34:34] are on the table do I expect that
[34:36] they'll
[34:37] happen uh I'm hopeful it would just be
[34:41] amazing to me if he said well no you're
[34:43] not fired we're just going to default on
[34:44] our debt to the fed and we're going to
[34:46] make good on the rest of our debt and
[34:47] we're GNA buy Bitcoin go find your
[34:49] retirement
[34:51] home so so this is just a great year if
[34:54] we come in if he comes in with an
[34:56] executive order to buy some bit coin
[34:58] right off the bat and and then he he
[35:01] works towards um moving Senator ls' Bill
[35:05] forward and passes that in 90 days all
[35:08] bets are off the whole world is going to
[35:11] change I really hope people are on board
[35:13] and understand that because if Trump
[35:16] does go down that route if he starts
[35:18] taking that path with the executive
[35:19] order and the purchase 1 million Bitcoin
[35:22] Reserve Bitcoin strategic Reserve then
[35:25] mg he's going to push out to the state
[35:28] we need Bitcoin mining
[35:29] operations so Alaska is going to get hit
[35:32] with you know now it's going to be we we
[35:36] need to extract the oil not only because
[35:38] we need the oil but we need to extract
[35:39] the oil so we can get the natural gas we
[35:41] can throw the Bitcoin miner on top so
[35:44] it's gonna it'll change how every state
[35:48] is funded you know if if the federal
[35:51] government will be more prone to support
[35:53] states that are mining Bitcoin and are
[35:55] producing it than states that are aren't
[35:58] um state of Alaska prime example when we
[36:01] put in the pipeline we have had a lot of
[36:03] um a lot of federal funds have Flo into
[36:05] the state over the decades and that's
[36:08] because we had the oil pipeline which
[36:11] is it's not nearly as full as it used to
[36:14] be I wouldn't even call it partially
[36:15] full it's almost a slow trickle so now
[36:19] with um and we had that support from the
[36:21] federal government because we had all
[36:23] that oil flowing down to the lower
[36:24] 48 but as that goes way those funds dry
[36:28] up it's going to be the same way with
[36:30] Bitcoin and States if the states can
[36:32] produce the Bitcoin the government will
[36:34] probably invest more into the
[36:35] infrastructure of the state to support
[36:37] the Bitcoin mining operations so I
[36:40] believe that if Trump goes down the
[36:41] rabbit hole of Bitcoin mining and
[36:44] Bitcoin strategic
[36:46] Reserve all the states will be really
[36:48] quickly adopting Bitcoin and the
[36:50] infrastructure will be focused on those
[36:54] operations especially in and to add to
[36:56] that we've got the uh the National
[36:58] Security aspect the block space you know
[37:00] if we need to have Bitcoin mining we
[37:02] need to decentralize that we need to
[37:04] have a certain amount of that here in
[37:05] the us but we want it located you know
[37:07] distributed throughout the US it's they
[37:10] just going to be a great a large push
[37:12] interesting uh it's almost like this uh
[37:15] golden window of opportunity uh for for
[37:18] for Bitcoin and it's almost feels like a
[37:21] a cold war where the the different
[37:23] players are sitting and and we're kind
[37:26] of waiting who's the first one to press
[37:28] the the button and buy as much Bitcoin
[37:30] as they can and starts this whole foral
[37:32] because it still feels a little bit of
[37:34] the the Cal before the storm right now
[37:37] we like yeah like he will be soon in
[37:39] office but currently nothing like even
[37:42] like the Russia Ukraine conflict nothing
[37:45] is happening currently there because
[37:48] soon Trump will be there let's see what
[37:49] he is doing H it's an interesting uh
[37:53] time uh to be alive that that that's for
[37:56] sure and I like the
[37:58] saying of uh it it could trigger in like
[38:01] a a really interesting time window uh
[38:04] for for for Bitcoin and and this this
[38:07] Golden Era maybe like even like a gold
[38:10] rush I could imagine especially one
[38:12] thing that we we kind of forget with all
[38:15] those nation state uh theories uh we
[38:17] have also still uh the first year of of
[38:21] Bitcoin ETFs that just kicked off a year
[38:24] ago uh and those were when we compare
[38:27] that to gold was really positive for the
[38:29] adoption for from a gold standpoint and
[38:32] I think it will do the same similar
[38:34] thing to the Bitcoin and on top of that
[38:37] we have the escco of adoption we have
[38:40] the nation state game fear we have all
[38:42] those things coming together oh man the
[38:45] next five years could be could be crazy
[38:48] it's it's going to be an amazing amazing
[38:50] time this year the but what I find
[38:53] interesting is um something that I
[38:55] haven't heard anybody talk about but it
[38:57] it hit me a couple weeks ago and I've
[38:58] been pondering it is the Bitcoin
[39:01] strategic Reserve we we had the gold
[39:03] strategic reserve and the whole Breton
[39:06] woods and and with that we took the
[39:11] inefficient dead Yellow Rock and we we
[39:15] mined it from the ground and then we
[39:17] shoved it back underground and we
[39:18] printed against the The
[39:20] Rock now we we put the rock back
[39:23] underground and we printed against it
[39:25] because it was the inferior technology
[39:26] for monetary a monetary system um no I'm
[39:30] not a big believer in Fiat
[39:32] currencies but The Rock was inferior if
[39:34] you if you listen to anyin Alden you
[39:36] know the gold died with the telegraph
[39:40] you know it maybe didn't die but it lost
[39:42] a lot of its value with the telegraph
[39:44] because you could transact globally you
[39:45] just couldn't transact so you couldn't
[39:48] send them the money so you needed the
[39:50] Fiat so now with the Bitcoin strategic
[39:53] Reserve if we're backing our dollar with
[39:56] Bitcoin we're
[39:58] we're actually taking the better asset
[40:01] for transacting and we're shoving it
[40:03] underground and we're backing it with
[40:05] Fiat so I'm it's interesting to think
[40:08] about it that way because why are we
[40:10] taking the inferior techn technology and
[40:13] continuing to use it and shoving the
[40:14] other one in a box and we're going to
[40:16] back our dollar with the
[40:18] Bitcoin that it just it so where does
[40:21] that go well of course we all know where
[40:23] that goes that's just Game Theory and
[40:25] people will keep transacting in Bitcoin
[40:26] and people people won't will care less
[40:28] and less about the dollar
[40:32] so sorry goad oh so it's just we're
[40:35] we're instead of taking the inferior
[40:36] technology and shove it in the ground
[40:38] we're taking the superior technology and
[40:39] shove it it in the ground so this is the
[40:42] uh innovat end like that's the the
[40:46] beginning of the end of the US dollar
[40:48] kind of what you're saying
[40:51] yes I I I feel also like that like a lot
[40:54] of people say like no we always have
[40:56] fear currency uh on top of Bitcoin maybe
[40:59] and stuff like that I'm like why would
[41:00] you do that I I get it with with gold
[41:03] because it's really hard to if I want to
[41:05] send you now $50 that's really hard for
[41:08] me to do with with gold it's even hard
[41:11] to do with Fiat the easiest thing for us
[41:14] to transact would be yeah let's do it
[41:16] over lightning Let's do let's do Bitcoin
[41:18] transaction that would be the easiest
[41:20] thing to do for the both of us
[41:22] so why would we put on an inferior
[41:27] technology on top of Bitcoin like that
[41:30] has that has absolutely no upside it's
[41:34] it's worse in transactions still
[41:36] manipulated uh and it has no value at
[41:39] all except the the pack of of the
[41:42] Bitcoin but they they will not pack it
[41:44] to anything because then they can just
[41:45] directly use the Bitcoin alsoo so you
[41:47] don't have any Securities around the the
[41:50] field anyways and then you have the same
[41:52] system that we have now just that maybe
[41:54] they own some Bitcoin which is doesn't
[41:57] change anything for me that that that's
[41:59] not an improvement like that that does
[42:02] nothing for me I feel
[42:04] like but yeah uh maybe maybe We're
[42:07] Dreaming I hope we're not uh really
[42:10] really interesting um maybe suiting to
[42:13] that topic especially also because
[42:15] you're in the Bitcoin veterans uh uh
[42:18] group what will Bitcoin do to war and
[42:22] Military and and and that topic for you
[42:25] so we all know that Wars funded through
[42:27] Fiat so just if the federal government
[42:31] needs to generate Bitcoin they're going
[42:33] to have to create value so they they
[42:35] create value through mining operations
[42:38] they have to work really hard to obtain
[42:41] Bitcoin and they're going to be
[42:42] competing with other nations to obtain
[42:44] that
[42:44] Bitcoin so they're less incentivized to
[42:48] go to war with other nations but even
[42:51] more so in my mind I believe that the
[42:53] federal government
[42:55] itself I I don't it can't maintain its
[42:59] current
[43:00] size so as Bitcoin is
[43:03] adopted there's they won't be able to
[43:06] debase the dollar to fund the federal
[43:07] government that means they have to font
[43:09] and tax everybody and if they font and
[43:11] tax everybody a lot of those revenues
[43:13] the states are going to insist on having
[43:14] those revenues local communities are
[43:15] going to need those revenues so I don't
[43:17] believe as much of it's going to go to
[43:18] the federal government so we're not
[43:20] going to be able to have a military of a
[43:23] massive size going back to if we go back
[43:26] to OPEC
[43:28] um that was the treaty with Saudi Arabia
[43:30] where we said we would protect you but
[43:32] you have to sell us cheap oil in every
[43:34] other nation has to buy energy in
[43:37] dollars so what did that do well the US
[43:41] I remember a lot of virtuous signaling
[43:43] back in the 80s and of course we all
[43:44] bought into it with the well there this
[43:47] person supporting child labor in this
[43:49] other Nation so they're a bad person
[43:51] well the the irony behind that is those
[43:54] Nations that don't aren't able to
[43:56] produce energy have to get dollars and
[43:59] compete to get those dollars so they can
[44:01] purchase cheap energy so they can air
[44:03] condition their homes and have lights in
[44:05] hospitals so we
[44:08] incentivized the bad behavior that we
[44:11] were so outraged by through OPEC but to
[44:17] take that further because every Other
[44:19] Nation had to compete for the dollar we
[44:21] could print to Infinity so we we as as
[44:27] sold their oil in dollars and every
[44:30] other Nation competed for the dollars
[44:31] they sold items to us for cheap that got
[44:34] rid of us industry and our primary
[44:37] export became the dollar and we exported
[44:39] our inflation on the rest of the world
[44:41] and since we were the only ones who
[44:43] could export our inflation no Nation
[44:45] could have a military that could even
[44:47] come close to the size of ours because
[44:49] we just keep printing to build more
[44:51] equipment you know more government
[44:53] contracts going to Lockheed and Granger
[44:56] and who whoever so now without being
[45:00] able to print to Infinity we cannot have
[45:03] a military that is printed to Infinity
[45:06] to compete with the rest of the world
[45:09] so War if virtu all conflicts around the
[45:14] world involve the US it it's interesting
[45:17] to look at if if it not directly we're
[45:21] funding them we're sending equipment to
[45:23] them we are we are putting people in
[45:26] power that we have no business having
[45:28] anything to do with you know another
[45:30] nation is another Nation they're not our
[45:32] nation they shouldn't be ours to control
[45:33] they're not a state of the us so we
[45:37] shouldn't be in the in their part of the
[45:39] world so
[45:41] as Bitcoin empowers the individual in
[45:44] those Nations to take on their
[45:45] governments which is a great empowerment
[45:47] for everybody in all those other nation
[45:49] states but it also removes the ability
[45:52] for the US to hinder the individuals in
[45:56] those Nations to to form their own you
[45:58] know societies that's super interesting
[46:00] yeah it's it's it's it's almost like
[46:04] when you take away the money printer you
[46:07] you take away their ability to to fund
[46:10] all those things and with that I I guess
[46:13] there will still be conflicts but they
[46:15] will be probably smaller and and way
[46:18] more limited because uh you have to you
[46:22] have to convince your own people to fund
[46:24] it and they will be way more critical of
[46:27] of that and I don't know how this will
[46:29] go so think about it like a bubble in
[46:31] the economic system a bubble being that
[46:34] you know an asset be because of our Fiat
[46:37] monetary system you have the highs and
[46:41] the lows of the Cycles right and we
[46:43] those you have the boom and the bust and
[46:46] it's the same way with in my mind the
[46:48] military and
[46:50] Wars if the the Great Depression was
[46:52] caused by the money printer but so are
[46:56] the great Wars they're caused by the
[46:57] money printer so without the money
[47:00] printer you won't have great Wars you'll
[47:03] have the smaller skirmishes because the
[47:05] booms in the bus they'll just naturally
[47:06] work themselves out before they get um
[47:09] inflated interesting yeah um by the way
[47:12] maybe I should have started with that uh
[47:15] what did you do in the in in the
[47:17] military and and where where were you
[47:19] there I was I was only in for one term
[47:22] I'm an X Air Force uh satellite
[47:24] microwave satcom wideband Communications
[47:26] tech
[47:27] uh went to tech school keyler Air Force
[47:29] Base Mississippi I was stationed on Guam
[47:31] and then in Utah before I got out Hill
[47:33] Air Force Base Utah love my time
[47:37] Island interesting uh did you get to
[47:40] bitcoin while while D no I was in the
[47:44] military I joined the military in 92 so
[47:48] oh yeah Bitcoin didn't come around for a
[47:51] long time for me I went down the rabbit
[47:53] hole initially a couple people got into
[47:57] it and the whole dynamic of um you know
[48:01] gaming currency the thought of that and
[48:03] what happened with the G online game Eve
[48:05] that was interesting to me and then I
[48:07] started I I fell down further down the
[48:09] rabbit hole with what really took me
[48:11] down was Mike Malone's the hidden
[48:13] secrets of money and I I I enjoy getting
[48:16] out in the outdoors here in Alaska spent
[48:18] a lot of time gold panning had a lot of
[48:20] equipment went up in the mountain Zone
[48:21] to claim so I understand the the
[48:23] Dynamics of gold and how it works and
[48:25] what it takes to extract it from the the
[48:27] ground
[48:29] so it just naturally flowed towards
[48:32] Bitcoin I a lot of people struggle with
[48:35] it and they they struggle with not
[48:38] understanding what gold is and how it
[48:39] works I remember um I met with a couple
[48:43] individuals who who have a decent sum of
[48:46] money in their lives so they're they're
[48:48] fairly well off so it's harder to orange
[48:50] pill people who are comfortable and it's
[48:51] hard to it's hard to Orange Peel people
[48:53] who are gold gold bugs and one of them
[48:58] was falling straight down the rabbit
[49:00] hole that that one was she was all the
[49:03] way there and her husband turned to me
[49:06] and she said uh or he said so uh if I
[49:10] wanted to sell my Bitcoin or sell my
[49:13] gold to buy Bitcoin how would I do that
[49:14] and I go that's that's the complicated
[49:16] question because if your spouse wanted
[49:19] to sell her Bitcoin and buy gold she
[49:20] could do it right now see the problem
[49:22] the problem you can't sell your gold to
[49:24] buy Bitcoin you have you you have it
[49:27] buried in the ground somewhere you got
[49:28] to go dig it up you have to ship it you
[49:30] have to get it assay you're GNA have to
[49:32] find a buyer but my Bitcoin I can sell
[49:35] right now and buy your gold I just don't
[49:37] want to because it's inferior it's the
[49:38] most liquid uh market and asset ever
[49:42] it's it's you can do it 247 it's it's
[49:45] it's kind of amazing it's also
[49:47] interesting what the point you brought
[49:48] up that it's harder to Orange Peel
[49:51] people who are well off it's it seems
[49:53] like pain is a big drive for Bitcoin
[49:56] adop
[49:58] yep yeah absolutely pain you you need
[50:01] the pain uh to and I guess that's that's
[50:04] where the biggest driver for Bitcoin
[50:07] adoption is then uh the inflation and
[50:10] the monetary expansion of of the the
[50:12] feared currency where you're currently
[50:15] living like that that's that seems to be
[50:17] the biggest uh lever for uh Bitcoin
[50:22] education uh because people have to get
[50:24] interested in in Bitcoin before you can
[50:26] get
[50:27] them educated and the price and the
[50:29] devaluation of their own currencies it's
[50:32] probably the biggest driver for that do
[50:34] do you see it that way or yeah it makes
[50:36] a difference here in Juno we have a huge
[50:39] housing crisis we have all of this land
[50:42] around us that the federal government
[50:43] won't let us build on so we can't expand
[50:47] our community so what's the scarce
[50:49] desirable asset it's just like
[50:51] oceanfront property in Miami it's you
[50:54] you is hard to afford it since covid
[50:57] it's gone up astronomically so now we
[51:00] have all of these jobs in Juno there's
[51:02] so many jobs and good jobs good paying
[51:04] jobs but nobody can afford to live in
[51:07] Juno you can't find housing in
[51:09] Juno
[51:11] so um there's pain here but even
[51:15] still it's still hard to orange pill the
[51:18] people who are going through pain
[51:20] because they don't have the money to
[51:22] invest it's harder for them to get a
[51:25] position so I do my best just to work
[51:27] with them and and establish that small
[51:30] position I whenever I I meet with
[51:32] somebody for the first time I just drop
[51:34] them 1020 bucks into into a wallet I set
[51:36] him up with a moon wallet and here you
[51:38] go this is my donation to you let's pay
[51:40] attention to this over time and watch
[51:41] what this does it's going to go up it's
[51:43] going to go down and eventually they
[51:46] come back to me not 100% of the time but
[51:50] it is I have more effect here in Juno
[51:52] doing that I believe because I will
[51:55] always run into them in there's no roads
[51:58] out but if if when I do that in other
[52:01] states when I go on trips I always try
[52:02] to tip in Bitcoin and when I when I do
[52:06] I'm able to set people up with wallets
[52:08] I'm always able to um get them some
[52:10] Bitcoin but I don't know what they're
[52:11] ever going to do with it I always give
[52:13] them my number hey reach out to me if
[52:15] you have any questions but we're they
[52:17] they don't always do
[52:19] so but here in Juno I'm always able to
[52:22] maintain that communication with people
[52:24] that's fascinating yeah sorry I just saw
[52:27] a tuna and really interesting and lovely
[52:30] area oh those are whales oh man the the
[52:34] the the picture that I just uh looked at
[52:37] I thought first their Mountains wait I
[52:39] have to uh show show that that you see
[52:43] that here chuno I first thought those
[52:46] are mountains but those are whales
[52:48] they're bubble feeding yeah we I have a
[52:50] boat so we're out with the whales all
[52:52] the time um it's it's beautiful here
[52:56] it's beautiful wow it's the the other
[52:58] side of the world I probably fly there
[53:00] like I don't know how many hours it's a
[53:04] furest away from Austria I guess really
[53:07] interesting um but that's amazing uh
[53:10] that that this is that you're doing that
[53:12] CRS movement and and the that that that
[53:15] moment and yeah I think dropping someone
[53:18] some Bitcoin in in a lightning wallet or
[53:20] something like that that's a really good
[53:22] Orange Building thing and one last thing
[53:25] because uh me Premier Bitcoin is really
[53:28] great and especially the UN conference I
[53:30] went to my first one in El
[53:32] Salvador last year in November it was uh
[53:37] and I was amazed by the UNC conference a
[53:38] really cool experience um but I never
[53:41] really talked about it on the podcast
[53:44] and you I think you said that you're
[53:46] part of the the me Premier Bitcoin
[53:48] you're tutor uh what is me Premier
[53:51] Bitcoin and and what are you doing there
[53:53] when I first joined them I remember we
[53:55] had a remote me meet up here in jino and
[53:57] I had a a bunch of people who just
[53:59] remoted in some incredible people uh
[54:01] Alex stanic Greg Foss Lisa Huff Don Bay
[54:05] um Andy pit just some incredible people
[54:08] well come to find out that Greg fost
[54:10] invested in um the company that put out
[54:13] the curriculum that me Premier Bitcoin
[54:15] ended up using so I was able when I
[54:17] found out about it via Cafe B in the
[54:19] morning on Twitter I was able to reach
[54:21] out to Greg Foss and the man is a he's a
[54:23] he's a beast love the man he he hooked
[54:26] me right up
[54:28] he I got off the phone with him and
[54:30] within 10 minutes I had a text from um
[54:34] him saying pick up the next call and it
[54:36] was the CEO of the company that came out
[54:37] with the curriculum and they put me in
[54:39] touch with John Dene and El Salvador and
[54:42] and that was it the the curriculum is
[54:45] incredible because it takes you from Zer
[54:48] to 60 it's not in 3.2 seconds but it
[54:51] takes you the whole journey all the way
[54:52] across from what is money all the way
[54:54] through utxo manager
[54:57] so you get the whole picture you have
[55:00] this group of phenomenal people who who
[55:03] you can tap for for information their
[55:07] you know people share their
[55:08] resources it it's just a it's a really
[55:11] good team of people um I was actually
[55:13] scheduled to be there at that conference
[55:15] um last year but my daughter had
[55:17] appendicitis the night before I was
[55:19] leaving so up in the ER um so I'm I'm
[55:24] sorry I wasn't able to meet you down
[55:25] there I was slated to be there but um
[55:29] once once I onboarded into it I started
[55:31] working in helping them develop the
[55:32] teachers curriculum for it that was fun
[55:35] and teaching people here in Juno through
[55:37] the curriculum I got to figure out what
[55:38] works and what doesn't um and and figure
[55:41] out how to tell what different people's
[55:43] interests are me Premier Bitcoin is to
[55:46] me is probably the best
[55:49] education um basic education into the
[55:51] Bitcoin world that there is it's a it's
[55:54] more timec consuming than maybe other
[55:56] methods but it's a great institution
[55:59] with some great people and John Den has
[56:03] a great he's just a great man he has a
[56:04] he has a true pure vision of what money
[56:08] is and where we're going to go so I
[56:10] strongly recommend that anybody who has
[56:12] the time just go to me Premier bitcoin's
[56:14] website download the PDF the me the um
[56:19] the curriculum and go through it you can
[56:21] contact me Premier Bitcoin find out if
[56:23] there's a light node in your area that
[56:25] can teach you or you can just download
[56:27] it online um Gabe Lord with operation
[56:30] Bitcoin he's the only thematic node For
[56:32] Me premiere uh so he uh he actually has
[56:36] a curriculum where he took their
[56:38] curriculum and um altered it for
[56:41] military veterans worked with them to
[56:43] alter it so he is teaching veterans the
[56:45] same curriculum but a little bit more
[56:47] geared towards military vets so if
[56:49] you're a veteran check out operation
[56:51] Bitcoin and his his lighten Hood I love
[56:55] that really cool um I I'm I'm fascinated
[56:58] by Grassroots movement and by by that
[57:00] what what Bitcoin uh me Bitcoin is doing
[57:04] really cool um I have one question for
[57:06] each and one every one of my guests and
[57:08] this is the question of what can we
[57:09] learn from you besides Bitcoin for me I
[57:13] don't
[57:14] know everything rolls back to the money
[57:17] and monetary energy for if somebody were
[57:20] to come up here and spend some time up
[57:22] here what would I do with them what
[57:23] would I teach them anything in the
[57:25] outdoors if it came down to fishing
[57:28] halit salmon or panning for gold so for
[57:32] learning get out get out and do stuff
[57:35] get out and go hiking get out and enjoy
[57:37] the mountains and enjoy the wildlife and
[57:39] everything's not focused around the
[57:42] world of people get out of the bar get
[57:45] out of the supermarket go out in the
[57:48] woods and enjoy the world I love that
[57:50] yeah it's a great Mission I Pro probably
[57:53] a really good thing to do also in in
[57:55] Alaska
[57:56] um thank you so much already um I have
[57:58] an end routine uh where the previous
[58:01] guest is asking a question for the next
[58:02] guest without knowing who the next guest
[58:04] actually is and your question from the
[58:06] previous guest is if you have a business
[58:09] or if you are in a business how much of
[58:12] this balance sheet of their balance
[58:14] sheet is already in Bitcoin I guess zero
[58:18] any develops any developments in in that
[58:21] direction for me I have a business in
[58:23] Bitcoin it's Bitcoin Alaska LLC so so oh
[58:27] yeah I forgot that ticket sales are in
[58:29] Bitcoin um you get a 15% discount for
[58:32] those that come in in Bitcoin and then
[58:33] of course you pay full price in dollars
[58:35] and it seems to be about 5050 right now
[58:38] you know you can change my balance sheet
[58:40] just by purchasing tickets in whatever
[58:41] format you choose to do so but as far as
[58:45] yeah that's that's it 50% right now
[58:47] eventually as I build out the Bitcoin
[58:49] Alaska LLC I'm considering going into uh
[58:52] have a nonprofit wing and actually doing
[58:54] things with tourism for the state of
[58:55] last
[58:56] and onboarding businesses into Bitcoin
[58:59] so when I do that it's just it I'm going
[59:01] to try and flow as much into Bitcoin as
[59:04] possible of course operating expenses
[59:06] will still have to be in dollars but
[59:08] anything above and beyond operating
[59:10] expenses i' I'd hold in
[59:12] Bitcoin really cool I love that really
