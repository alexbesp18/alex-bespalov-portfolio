[00:00] Bitcoin is astronomy crypto is astrology
[00:02] I'm sorry there is no uniquely valuable
[00:05] use case for any cryptos except for
[00:08] Bitcoin they all vote for Social
[00:10] Security and Medicare and they all vote
[00:11] for more defense spending and bigger
[00:13] government one side might talk about
[00:15] cutting spending more than others but
[00:17] they don't do it Bitcoin might not care
[00:19] about politics but politics cares about
[00:22] you because they want to tax you as long
[00:24] as Americans have the right to protest
[00:26] and oppose and deny tbdc as long as
[00:30] Americans fight for privacy and against
[00:32] surveillance Tech and AI That's closed
[00:35] source and controlled by Google open AI
[00:37] Microsoft that we have a chance to have
[00:40] peaceful transition and a natural
[00:42] transition and evolution from the US
[00:44] dollar to bitcoin Bitcoin will become
[00:46] the dominant long-term store value if
[00:48] you send Bitcoin to a new address nobody
[00:50] knows if you control that new address so
[00:53] that's privacy for we really need a hard
[00:55] money that is cannot be stopped cannot
[00:57] be taken away and that's good one
[01:03] before we get into the current topics I
[01:05] I want to just get quickly why you are
[01:08] so passionate about Bitcoin yes so it's
[01:11] partly because my late parents were both
[01:15] born in
[01:17] China and grew up in families that were
[01:22] on the losing side of the Chinese Civil
[01:24] War meaning they were wiing da or k&t
[01:28] not communist
[01:30] and growing up they hated communism and
[01:34] the culture Revolution and all that many
[01:37] people by the way in case your listeners
[01:39] don't know tens of milons of people died
[01:42] during the cultural revolution in
[01:43] Chinese Civil War Mount dong with a
[01:45] horrible
[01:47] dictator and he basically confiscated on
[01:50] my dad's side of the family gold Jade
[01:53] silver
[01:54] jewelry Furniture house socks bonds all
[01:59] these after so we went from sort upper
[02:03] middle class to
[02:05] four because of confiscation so that
[02:08] helped me understand the importance of
[02:11] Bitcoin as a bearer asset something that
[02:15] cannot be taken
[02:16] away and cannot be stopped if I want to
[02:19] give you Bitcoin I just push a button
[02:22] and you just accept it once you have it
[02:25] no one else has it I cannot take it back
[02:28] so that
[02:30] once I was able to put two and two
[02:32] together and took me a
[02:34] while then I realized why Bitcoin was so
[02:37] important so I had a little bit of an
[02:39] unfair advantage over others who do not
[02:42] have that story people important to them
[02:45] had very strong views about confiscation
[02:48] or were victims of
[02:50] confiscation and asset seizure yeah I
[02:53] think it's interesting because like for
[02:55] me in Austria most people don't get
[02:58] Bitcoin they're like it's a luxury good
[03:01] and those who get it they like yeah I
[03:04] just keep it on Exchange because they
[03:05] don't they trust the exchanges they like
[03:07] like they will not do anything wrong
[03:09] with it uh I mean even after FDX they
[03:12] saw after FDX they saw Celsius but
[03:14] they're like no my exchange is different
[03:17] I I don't need to hold my own Keys like
[03:19] I can keep it on there so like sometimes
[03:21] I feel like in privileged countries they
[03:24] are like a little bit blind to what
[03:27] actually can happen to you and they're
[03:28] not looking all the world what actually
[03:30] can happen in every country like USA or
[03:34] Austria or Europe they're not excluded
[03:36] from from that can come to them it will
[03:39] come to them if the fear system
[03:42] continues like that which also brings us
[03:44] to to one of our current topics I think
[03:47] it will become more and more a topic of
[03:49] the podcast fortunately or unfortunately
[03:52] depending on how you see it um the US
[03:54] elections like it started I think a lot
[03:57] of with RFK even last year at the
[04:00] Bitcoin conference talking about Bitcoin
[04:03] then this year with RFK and Donald Trump
[04:06] and so many other politicians actually
[04:07] at the Bitcoin conference how do you
[04:09] assess right now the the current state
[04:11] of like Bitcoin politics ETFs us
[04:15] elections what's your your current take
[04:17] on it sure so my current take is uh
[04:20] bitcoiners did a great job with RFK Jr
[04:24] his policies and his understanding and
[04:26] his passion for Bitcoin is crystal clear
[04:29] so that's fantastic obviously no one's
[04:32] perfect especially politicians and he
[04:34] did do I think a podcast with Charles
[04:37] hoskinson the cardono scammer and called
[04:40] him a bitcoiner which is
[04:42] wrong with Donald Trump Jr I thought it
[04:46] was very good but it's looking not so
[04:49] good now because Trump has not mentioned
[04:51] Bitcoin by name since the conference he
[04:54] ended his speech at the Bitcoin
[04:56] conference with have fun playing with
[04:58] your Bitcoin your cryptos and whatever
[05:01] else you play or playing with which is
[05:04] kind of very
[05:05] trumpy kind of a you frankly or Fu
[05:10] to bitcoiners like thanks for the money
[05:13] it was less than I expected or whatever
[05:15] and you know F off and then yesterday he
[05:20] came out with a defi or his kid came out
[05:23] with a defi scam that I believe Trump
[05:26] promoted or rep posted about on Truth
[05:28] social not Twitter but on true social
[05:32] I'm to his audience and I get it you
[05:33] know he has huge debts to pay from his
[05:37] legal
[05:38] problems um and he's supporting his
[05:41] child which any good Dad should do but
[05:44] it's pretty scammy and let's not forget
[05:46] that MAA token promoted by Donald Trump
[05:50] Jr again was uh something that there was
[05:54] an event for using the Bitcoin Nashville
[05:57] 2024 logos
[06:00] and having David Bailey founder and
[06:02] sorry not the founder but the CEO of
[06:05] Bitcoin conference maybe is the founder
[06:07] of Bitcoin conference he was the only
[06:10] listed special guest for that event so
[06:14] they named used his name and likeness
[06:16] they use the
[06:18] Bitcoin conference logos to promote this
[06:21] so-called side event that he uh felt
[06:25] like he needed to wanted to attend and
[06:28] support it's a shitcoin obviously so
[06:32] this is one of those why bitcoiners are
[06:34] so upset about I like Bitcoin buy my
[06:36] shitcoin so I would say um I I just did
[06:39] a report card it's you're asking a great
[06:41] question I said presidential Bitcoin
[06:44] presidential report card according to me
[06:47] RFK Jr
[06:48] A+ uh although I should Proby lower it
[06:51] given the cardano
[06:54] affiliation um Donald Trump B+ which
[06:57] arguably stands for Bad Plus terrible
[07:00] take it as you will and you know maybe
[07:02] falling because of the I think Bitcoin
[07:06] is damaged when it's associated with
[07:08] scamps I really hate scamps I believe in
[07:10] consumer protection if you're GNA
[07:13] defraud somebody or mislead them you can
[07:16] do that to Big Banks or institutions or
[07:18] wealthy people you cannot do that to
[07:20] retail especially us retail these are
[07:23] working people they're often poor people
[07:25] it's wrong and it's frankly often
[07:28] illegal um um so B+ for Donald Trump and
[07:31] then lastly
[07:33] quickly the land of the plane kamla
[07:36] Harris I would give her a d she has Pro
[07:39] digital asset growth policy or stance
[07:43] but there's zero specific Bitcoin
[07:45] policies yet but that's why I started
[07:48] Bitcoin for Harris at Bitcoin the number
[07:51] four Harris please follow sorry I'm a
[07:54] American I'm born in the US I'm and I
[07:57] did sales a little over promotional
[08:00] perhaps for um more
[08:04] straightforward and humble Europeans
[08:07] like yourself um
[08:10] and I support Kay Harris for non-bitcoin
[08:14] reasons but also for Bitcoin reasons I
[08:17] think it's important to donate money
[08:19] raise money get a seat at the table
[08:22] because if she becomes
[08:23] president we won't have leg up to those
[08:28] of us who help
[08:30] to hopefully Advance self- custody
[08:33] policy push no CBD seats push no Deb
[08:37] Banking and push right to mind and
[08:41] privacy and things like that I actually
[08:43] think just to end with this Amala Harris
[08:47] In Her speech yesterday at the
[08:49] Democratic National Convention her
[08:51] acceptance speech as the official kind
[08:53] of democratic nominee for president she
[08:55] mentioned Trump doing scams and he he is
[08:59] he's done four nfts himself and he's
[09:02] promoting scams by his by his child and
[09:05] possibly other children and Melania did
[09:07] an nft which to me are scams these are
[09:09] all I like Bitcoin by my shitcoin
[09:12] scams I
[09:14] think it is realistic but very hard to
[09:19] overcome March cubin and other
[09:21] billionaires Brian Armstrong and others
[09:23] we're trying to buy crypto policy with
[09:26] the Democrats and Republicans but with
[09:29] the Harris Administration by pushing for
[09:32] let me scam in peace
[09:35] legislation but giving Kamas prosecutor
[09:38] background fact that she thinks Trump
[09:41] scams I think given the huge amount of
[09:44] Americans millions of Americans have
[09:46] lost billions of dollars through crypto
[09:49] scams I think Bitcoin is a safe play
[09:52] it's a safe asset to promote and then
[09:55] you know we can see we're not going to
[09:57] like necessarily ban crypto I think
[09:59] that's a mistake but to not kind of
[10:02] promote let me scam in peace policies
[10:05] and still prosecute the next SP SPF or
[10:08] Min SPF right and other scammers I think
[10:12] that's important to protect Americans
[10:14] and I think that will help get her votes
[10:16] and also get Elizabeth Warren off her
[10:18] backat that's really interesting um I
[10:21] have three four really interesting
[10:23] questions for you about that but the
[10:25] first I want to start
[10:27] with bitcoiners often have this thing in
[10:31] their head like I have Bitcoin I have I
[10:33] don't have to care about politics like I
[10:36] meet a lot of bitcoiners Al was like I
[10:38] can even talk for myself like I was in
[10:40] politics I was uh head of a Youth
[10:45] Organization um in my local area like
[10:48] it's really small because like it's in
[10:49] Europe and Europe is small then there's
[10:51] like Austria Austria even way small and
[10:53] it was just one small region and the
[10:55] Youth Organization but I was the head of
[10:57] that Youth Organization so I got a
[10:59] little bit of taste of politics uh and I
[11:02] was really in there uh and I liked it I
[11:05] was like I'm always a competitive guy uh
[11:08] but then I found Bitcoin and I found
[11:12] more and more that I'm actually not that
[11:14] interested in politics so with Bitcoin I
[11:16] came away from Bitcoin from politics but
[11:18] the interesting thing that happened the
[11:20] last year or two I was getting more
[11:24] realistic and I was like I'm a person
[11:27] still on this planet and I have to care
[11:31] for my physical presence where I am
[11:33] because this politics actually affects
[11:36] me uh maybe politics doesn't affect
[11:39] directly Bitcoin but it affects me as a
[11:43] person holding Bitcoin so of course if
[11:47] the US now goes into full we ban Bitcoin
[11:50] things I don't think Bitcoin might be
[11:53] slowed down might be a shortterm medium
[11:56] term not as good but long term it will
[11:58] be still
[12:00] amazing but maybe you as an US citizen
[12:03] uh really um uh are negatively impacted
[12:07] by a bad ad administration of Bitcoin
[12:12] policies so I'm getting more and more
[12:15] back into politics where I'm like oh you
[12:17] have to care about politics um long long
[12:20] question for you how important is a
[12:24] politics for bitcoiner for bitcoiners
[12:28] that's very important because bitcoiners
[12:31] and Bitcoin might not care about
[12:33] politics but politics and the state
[12:36] cares about you the bitcoiner because
[12:39] they want to tax you they don't like the
[12:41] fact that you have a beer asset that
[12:43] they cannot confiscate or tax easily
[12:46] that the fact that you can transact
[12:49] permissionless peer-to-peer I could send
[12:51] you Bitcoin I could send you a billion
[12:53] dollars Bitcoin and someday maybe we do
[12:56] that if I have enough Bitcoin and you
[12:58] need something coin but I I doubt I'll
[13:00] be that POS in in that position and
[13:02] hopefully you'll have bcoin but I can
[13:04] send any family member or person I want
[13:06] to help in the
[13:08] world just
[13:11] digitally um Bitcoin almost
[13:13] instantaneously make maybe takes 10
[13:15] minutes to
[13:16] settle and no one can stop it it's a
[13:19] reversible I can do a billion dollars of
[13:21] Bitcoin imagine trying to do that with a
[13:24] plain load of gold or physical cash that
[13:29] plan's not taking off from LAX I live in
[13:32] Los Angeles even if it lands let's say
[13:34] in
[13:34] Vienna uh not only is your bit your gold
[13:39] or physical cash being confiscated
[13:42] you're being and detained you're being
[13:44] detained you person be detained they're
[13:48] being like why are you getting a billion
[13:50] dollars or oh sorry of gold or physical
[13:53] cat what's going
[13:54] on so yeah the state has an interest in
[13:58] increasing their power that's just
[14:01] natural um it's an entity like any other
[14:04] entity that naturally wants to get
[14:06] bigger and
[14:08] stronger we have to fight against that
[14:10] natural
[14:12] tendency I'm more naturally for small
[14:15] government ideally no government but I
[14:18] think realistically small government and
[14:21] let people do what they want so socially
[14:23] I would say I'm Progressive or liberal
[14:26] physically I'm conservative and want
[14:28] smaller
[14:29] government interesting uh do you think
[14:32] when we look at like maybe 50 hundred
[14:35] years from now uh and Bitcoin is
[14:37] actually successful we have Bitcoin
[14:40] whatever the what whatever it means that
[14:43] Bitcoin is successful but let's say we
[14:45] have kind of a Bitcoin standard you can
[14:46] pay mostly in Bitcoin everyone accepts
[14:49] like Bitcoin is the main store of value
[14:51] maybe even um mostly uh use it as a
[14:54] medium exchange maybe even a unit of
[14:57] account but let's let's just take this
[15:00] debate on side but um when Bitcoin is
[15:05] successful what is then the role of of
[15:07] uh do you think the role of government
[15:09] will be more service based or do they
[15:12] still have the same type of control over
[15:15] the citizens because they don't have the
[15:17] money printer anymore or they have a
[15:19] very limited money printer because it uh
[15:22] inflation and Bitcoin is so good it's
[15:24] such a great question I think but I'm
[15:28] not 100 %
[15:30] sure
[15:31] that um government will be much more
[15:35] limited we'll have far fewer Wars
[15:37] because it's hard to print money to to
[15:39] finance it print as much money out of
[15:41] thin air create it um because you can't
[15:44] print more than 21 Milli Bitcoin that's
[15:47] all that will ever be mined not even
[15:50] printing
[15:52] um but I think it will be up to us
[15:56] bitcoiners for in early keep in mind
[15:59] that we are very early Bitcoin at $1
[16:01] trillion or so market cap is less than
[16:05] is about
[16:07] 0.1% of the total assets in the world
[16:11] which is about $900 trillion dollar
[16:13] worth so think about how early we are to
[16:16] already be in Bitcoin and many of us
[16:18] already have one Bitcoin or significant
[16:21] portion of one Bitcoin that's
[16:23] fantastic we're all going to be very
[16:26] wealthy or I should say our our ranked
[16:28] kids or great grandkids will be very
[16:30] wealthy in 50 to 100 years so that's
[16:33] going to be great for them and it's up
[16:36] to them to not abuse that power and take
[16:40] advantage of the
[16:42] poor because there will be people who
[16:44] have 10 SATs and that's all they have or
[16:49] whatever it is I love the analysis of of
[16:52] I think Jesse Meers put it out with like
[16:54] the 900 trillion and the
[16:56] 0.1 uh percent and then there's like the
[17:00] the the unknown question the question
[17:03] that is really interesting to think
[17:05] about how much of that full 900 trillion
[17:08] or maybe maybe it's even uh more now
[17:13] because I think it's one year old now
[17:14] this this analysis um how much of that
[17:17] total assets Bitcoin can
[17:20] realistically uh take I think Jesse
[17:22] Myers uh conservatively takes
[17:26] 20% um then some people say like like uh
[17:30] oh Bitcoin is money so it's it's 50% of
[17:32] everything so 50% do you have any
[17:34] framework to think about how much of the
[17:37] total assets Bitcoin can observe no no
[17:39] matter a time frame because time frame
[17:41] is really hard yes so this is hundreds
[17:44] of years from now but I think it can be
[17:46] much closer to 100% than 0% so way over
[17:50] 50% here's why what is the current
[17:54] allocation breakdown of the 900 trillion
[17:58] a lot of it is in real estate real
[18:00] estate needs to be demonetized it's
[18:02] ridiculous it's just a place you live in
[18:06] uh unless governments remove property
[18:10] tax right you have this tax on this
[18:14] asset that's funding a lot of the
[18:16] schools and so forth and government's
[18:18] way too
[18:19] big the public pensions the public union
[18:23] workers are way overpaid in America you
[18:27] can make half a million dollars a year
[18:29] for doing
[18:30] nothing being retired because you work
[18:33] three different public pension public
[18:35] jobs for local or state government it's
[18:38] ridiculous that's number one number two
[18:41] government is way too big and
[18:42] bureaucratic wasteful they spend a lot
[18:43] of money on projects that don't
[18:46] accomplish what they're set out to do at
[18:48] least in the United States I don't know
[18:50] as much about Austria although I imagine
[18:53] it's similar because you know Europe is
[18:56] I would say further along towards um
[18:58] socialism and bigger government it's wor
[19:01] than the United States yeah I'd love to
[19:04] hear stories sometimes but um um and
[19:08] then I'd also say that um so real estate
[19:13] is about I don't know 400 trillion 300
[19:15] trillion needs to be
[19:17] demonetized bonds a lot of bonds are
[19:20] long-term or medium-term and those need
[19:22] to be demonetized so all these long-term
[19:25] stores of value are going to be replaced
[19:29] if we're wildly successful I would say
[19:31] bitcoin's already successful 15 years in
[19:33] we're not over a trillion dollars it's
[19:36] being adopted by two out of three major
[19:39] presidential campaigns although RFK Jr
[19:41] has zero chance of winning he can play
[19:44] King maker Queen maker and kind of help
[19:48] decide if Trump or Paris is going to be
[19:52] the next president by supporting one or
[19:55] the other and telling his voters to
[19:57] follow so um
[19:59] two out of three US presidential
[20:01] candidates are Bitcoin Pro
[20:04] Bitcoin kamla's on her way have
[20:06] confidence she'll get there but I'm not
[20:09] at all sure she'll get there so that's
[20:12] why I'm working so hard
[20:13] to regardless of whether you're voting
[20:17] for her I think it's important that
[20:18] people donate to her campaign through my
[20:23] link or another link that is clearly for
[20:27] Bitcoin Pro Bitcoin policy not pro
[20:30] crypto because they just want to scam in
[20:32] peace and Mark Cuban threw bitcoiners
[20:35] under the bus by calling us Elite
[20:37] Bitcoin Maxis who just care about our
[20:39] own Bitcoin
[20:41] Banks so we really need to have
[20:47] government and politicians be Pro
[20:51] Bitcoin is maybe RFK one of the the
[20:55] deciders of the election I feel like
[20:59] he will probably decide where he joins
[21:02] and I think he's
[21:04] Democrat he tried to run as a Democrat
[21:07] and the
[21:08] democ the way power
[21:11] works I think you know this I think a
[21:13] lot of bitcoiners know this but for
[21:15] maybe and you're you have a very
[21:18] sophisticated older audience from around
[21:22] the world and a lot of them are
[21:23] Americans so I just say to the few that
[21:26] are just joining because interested in
[21:29] why is a bitcoiner supporting
[21:32] H I would say that whether it's a
[21:35] Democratic party or Republican
[21:37] party the powers that be the powers in
[21:40] picking who the rest of us vote for does
[21:44] that make sense if you have the power to
[21:47] decide what is
[21:49] acceptable among the political
[21:51] candidates that the rest of us can hear
[21:54] from through mainstream media on
[21:56] political debates over War four
[21:59] you've already dictated what the range
[22:02] of outcome is to something that you can
[22:04] live with to something that you really
[22:06] want right the choices are all okay to
[22:09] you at worst so we're picking from not
[22:12] very good choices because we don't have
[22:14] the power to pick who the candidates are
[22:16] we're picking from a very narrow
[22:19] selection of people does that make sense
[22:22] and policies yeah it's interesting
[22:25] because just for example in Austria we
[22:28] we will have five different parties uh
[22:31] in the in the parliament of Austria uh
[22:34] and there are the the biggest party will
[22:36] probably have like 25% of the votes so
[22:39] that's like a really big difference to
[22:41] America where the there's just two
[22:44] parties and there's like I I understand
[22:45] there's like third and fourth parties
[22:48] but they're so small that so small
[22:50] they're almost not there ineffective
[22:54] yeah they're very ineffective
[22:57] unfortunately so yeah so we basically
[23:00] have a uni party in my opinion and I
[23:02] think a lot of your audience will agree
[23:04] with
[23:05] me both Republican and
[23:09] Democratic presidents administrations
[23:13] Senators congressmen they all vote for
[23:16] Social Security Medicare and they all
[23:19] vote for more defense spending and
[23:21] bigger
[23:22] government they talk one side might talk
[23:25] about cutting spending more than others
[23:28] that would be the Republicans but they
[23:30] don't do it the deficits grow under both
[23:33] parties the spending grows under both
[23:35] parties I don't know what
[23:38] delusional I guess the rhetoric is
[23:41] important but they must think the voters
[23:44] are very stupid and then the Democrats
[23:47] talk about you know being anti-war they
[23:50] War as much as the Republicans at least
[23:53] Trump even though I don't like him and I
[23:55] think it's totally unprecedent because
[23:57] he won't cons ceed when he loses based
[24:00] on the rules but the rules are the rules
[24:02] of the game you can hate the game hate
[24:04] the players but once you've run out of
[24:06] ways to appeal cannot sit by
[24:10] passively as some folks peacefully visit
[24:14] the capital but some folks were not so
[24:16] peaceful maybe it was 90% peaceful maybe
[24:19] they were incited by feds and um goated
[24:23] to become violent but that was you know
[24:28] some of the stuff looks scary even if
[24:30] it's 99% peaceful just like the George
[24:34] Floyd riots were mostly peaceful but
[24:36] then you saw burnings building down and
[24:39] people getting attacked and police
[24:41] officers getting injured by protesters
[24:44] so I see both sides I think um Trump
[24:49] will not concede peacefully necessarily
[24:53] just like arguably he did not on January
[24:55] 6 so but both parties are for growing
[25:00] government they don't cut government
[25:02] they're fiscally totally irresponsible
[25:05] running massive deficits or debt GDP
[25:08] ratios ridiculous and even our federal
[25:11] net outlays Robin
[25:14] meaning revenues from tax and
[25:18] fees
[25:20] uh are very low compared to the amount
[25:25] of GDP so
[25:28] so we need to improve those ratios we're
[25:34] never going to pay the US debt down I
[25:36] don't know if you know Morgan howel he's
[25:39] very smart I wish he was a bitcoiner but
[25:41] he's very smart Economist wrote a great
[25:43] book anyway he said
[25:46] look just like after World War II us
[25:50] will probably grow our way out of the
[25:53] debt so that the tax is collected on a
[25:56] growing GDP if the GDP grows faster than
[26:00] the debt then you can collect more taxes
[26:02] and that's how you deal with increased
[26:04] debt
[26:05] right you're never going to pay the debt
[26:08] down but if the economy is growing big
[26:10] faster than the debt at some point then
[26:11] you're probably okay but that's the
[26:14] problem is debt is growing so fast and
[26:17] the growth is not there so it's very
[26:21] scary and we're in a time of relative
[26:24] peace very few
[26:26] Americans are Graves service me Members
[26:30] very few Americans are deployed in
[26:32] combat right now so we're not at War
[26:36] even though we're involved in Wars the
[26:38] American Military is mostly not at War
[26:40] so that's good but imagine if we are at
[26:43] War and war is very expensive what
[26:46] that's going to do to the economy so
[26:48] we're one sort of economic or natural
[26:51] disaster Health disaster away from not
[26:55] be going full wart
[26:58] and becoming the next
[27:00] Austria what do you think uh would
[27:02] happen if if we have something like
[27:04] maybe like a second covid or something
[27:06] like that where we really
[27:08] spend aggressively again uh I mean the
[27:12] inflation is already a lot but then on
[27:15] top of that because I think a lot of the
[27:17] inflation we still will experience later
[27:20] it it's not like directly coming um what
[27:24] will happen then is is that hyper bit
[27:26] conization in five years
[27:28] yeah so um before I answer the question
[27:31] I want to challenge the premise just a
[27:33] little bit if I may so as an American
[27:36] and I don't want to come off like a
[27:38] crazy gun toading AR15 assault
[27:41] rifle American but I am for the Second
[27:44] Amendment I think it's extremely
[27:46] important and we cannot have a situation
[27:49] where we have another Co lock you that
[27:52] would be a disaster for the economy and
[27:55] civil rights and just mentally and
[27:59] emotionally the isolation especially for
[28:02] people who are
[28:03] extroverts it's ridiculous it's not just
[28:07] that people don't have the right to work
[28:09] and make their own decisions and they're
[28:11] giving us an experimental vaccine that
[28:13] seems far more dangerous especially the
[28:15] young men than we thought with these U
[28:18] mild carditis risks and other risks so
[28:21] this kind of unproven vaccine that
[28:24] unlike and I'm not a vaccine
[28:26] conspiracist I'm not anti
[28:29] the other vaccines work because they've
[28:30] been through the FDA normal process this
[28:33] process was
[28:35] expedited and they gave big Pharma
[28:38] immunity total immunity so they're not
[28:40] liable for anything it's
[28:43] ridiculous uh so I think at this point
[28:46] they can Sunset and repeal the immunity
[28:50] and if they are going to give people
[28:52] suggestions or recommendations to get a
[28:55] boost or whatever that's fine people can
[28:58] do what they want um hopefully the
[29:01] censorship of people who warned us
[29:03] doctors and medical professionals who
[29:05] warned us that this vaccine was
[29:07] dangerous and experimental that co uh
[29:10] risk was pretty low to moderate or
[29:13] almost zero for healthy people
[29:16] especially young people obviously it's
[29:19] different if you're older we know that
[29:21] we know that it's different if you're
[29:23] immunal compromised or extremely obese
[29:26] or have hard condition whatever for
[29:29] comorbidities but people should be able
[29:31] to make their choice I think the right
[29:33] approach would be to
[29:35] recommend strongly that people stay home
[29:38] if they are high risk or caring for
[29:41] someone high risk which is risk averse
[29:44] fine if you're introvert you almost
[29:46] prefer to stay home anyway and not have
[29:48] to deal with people so maybe you have
[29:49] the right to work from home I think
[29:52] that's great that people you know don't
[29:53] have to go up go to work necessarily but
[29:56] that should be up to the employee and
[29:58] maybe yeah no so so so I want I do want
[30:02] to challenge that premise a little bit
[30:04] but to answer your question if there is
[30:05] a second let's say just disaster where
[30:08] they have to spend a lot of
[30:11] money I think the US can handle it but I
[30:14] think there's going to be a huge collat
[30:16] damage to weaker countries that are
[30:18] denominated that use the US dollar as
[30:21] their legal tender whether it's Ecuador
[30:24] or other countries that use uh I'm not
[30:27] sure if Ecuador still does it but they
[30:29] did when when I visited countries that
[30:32] use use the US dollar is legal tender I
[30:34] think they'll be greatly affected from
[30:36] the massive money
[30:38] printing um they're just weaker
[30:40] countries economically than the US I
[30:43] really believe in the US dollar
[30:45] milkshake
[30:46] Theory by Santiago capital I think that
[30:49] the US will coexist with Bitcoin he's
[30:51] not a bitcoiner but I think the US
[30:53] dollar will close us with Bitcoin for a
[30:56] long time with the US as being the
[30:58] global Reserve currency and shortterm
[31:01] store value Bitcoin will become the
[31:04] dominant long-term store value
[31:06] increasingly slow so as it demonetizes
[31:09] art real estate long-term bonds and so
[31:12] forth so yeah will the other will the
[31:17] other Fiat currencies uh go away and the
[31:20] US dollar will be used I mean stable
[31:22] coins kind of do do do more of the work
[31:24] for for US Dollars yeah so so that
[31:28] that's a great example in Latin America
[31:30] my understanding is when you visit
[31:32] Argentina Venezuela and other
[31:34] hyperinflation countries they prefer
[31:37] physical cash US dollars they prefer for
[31:40] long-term store value gold and Bitcoin
[31:43] and then for me of exchange it's really
[31:45] fiscal US Dollars and things like tether
[31:48] maybe
[31:50] usdc because that's just what they're
[31:54] they think has real value so
[31:58] the global Reserve currency is a winner
[32:00] take all phenomenon the Euro Japanese
[32:03] Yen and the Chinese Yuan are distant
[32:07] second third and fourth currencies and
[32:10] the British
[32:11] pound those sort of currencies are
[32:15] not very important compared to the US
[32:18] dollar everybody wants to do the U use
[32:21] the US dollar the US Navy and US
[32:24] military and US government and US
[32:26] intelligence because we control and have
[32:29] so much power keeping the shipping lanes
[32:32] open there's a strong incentive
[32:36] for countries in the Middle East to sell
[32:39] their oil and other countries to sell
[32:41] their oil denominated in US dollars so
[32:43] Petra dollar will continue for some time
[32:46] US dollar will continue to be the global
[32:47] Reserve currency I think increasingly so
[32:50] so as um the hundreds of currencies
[32:55] or many dozens of currencies
[32:59] start to implode and people just start
[33:01] to move more and more to US dollar Sur
[33:05] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[33:07] a regular basis I guess you already
[33:09] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[33:12] important step is to keep their Bitcoin
[33:15] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[33:18] personal recommendation for Hardware
[33:19] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure

[34:18] sovereign individual in general and last
[34:21] but not least I have something
[34:22] completely new for you guys I partnered
[34:26] up with coin video vilante this is the
[34:29] most beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I
[34:32] ever saw created by anyone look at that
[34:35] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[34:37] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[34:41] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[34:44] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[34:46] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[34:50] make sure to check out the link in the
[34:52] description for this amazing coin
[34:54] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[34:57] amazing a lot them so much it was really
[34:59] hard for me to pick the one that I want
[35:01] to have because there are a lot of great
[35:03] options I went with the new transparency
[35:06] Edition they're all limited so grab
[35:09] yours those will not be available for a
[35:12] long time but there will come new models
[35:14] and new amazing designs along the way I
[35:17] also feel uh that will be definitely
[35:19] medium-term but do you think longterm
[35:20] then uh the play comes like Bitcoin
[35:23] versus US dollar at some
[35:25] point or is it like oh US dollar is
[35:27] always will will be coexisting I am
[35:30] extremely optimistic that as long as
[35:32] Americans have the right to bear arms as
[35:34] long as Americans protest and
[35:38] oppose and deny
[35:41] tbdc As Long As Americans fight for
[35:44] privacy and against surveillance Tech
[35:47] and AI That's close source and
[35:49] controlled by Google open AI Microsoft
[35:54] or right or whoever else that we have a
[35:58] chance to have a peaceful transition and
[36:01] a natural transition and evolution from
[36:04] the US dollar to
[36:06] bitcoin otherwise I think we're funed
[36:08] and there's going to be our our our
[36:10] grandkids or great great great grandkids
[36:13] will
[36:13] have there's going to be war and a lot
[36:16] of people die so that's why I think it's
[36:18] so important that we have a lot of
[36:22] Americans who own Bitcoin a lot of
[36:25] Americans who own guns
[36:28] and can defend themselves and have
[36:30] privacy security it's very important I I
[36:35] don't um need to you don't like you as
[36:40] an American don't necessarily need to
[36:42] own a gun but it's very important that
[36:44] your neighbors do so that nobody
[36:47] knows which neighbor owns guns and which
[36:51] doesn't if no neighbors own guns then
[36:53] you're going to have a situation like
[36:55] communist China
[36:58] Stalin Russia and Nazi Germany where
[37:02] they can kill millions of Jews millions
[37:05] of Russians millions of
[37:07] Chinese because they can't defend
[37:10] themselves you just have knives and you
[37:12] know Forks it's ridiculous how are you
[37:14] going to defend yourself when the other
[37:16] side has machine guns and weapons bombs
[37:19] and yeah that's an interesting point
[37:21] because I think a lot of European don't
[37:23] get this um I more and more get this as
[37:26] I don't know what you guys are taught in
[37:27] school but that's not good I think
[37:30] Americans because the American
[37:32] Revolution and just so many Americans
[37:35] hunt and own guns legally
[37:39] and popular in the US for men and women
[37:42] to go to the gun range post pictures on
[37:45] Instagram of themselves at the gun range
[37:48] it's a very different and I'm not a gun
[37:51] nut at all I choose to live in Los
[37:53] Angeles where I have friends and family
[37:56] I love the weather I love the food the
[37:58] people and you know socially and liberal
[38:01] so are progressive so it works for me
[38:03] absolutely it's interesting for me
[38:05] because even like when there is a
[38:07] government that knows the citizens have
[38:10] a lot of
[38:11] guns they think more carefully what they
[38:15] do like I as a president of a of of a
[38:19] Nation where no all my citizens have a
[38:22] lot of guns I I would be more careful
[38:25] with the actions I do because I know
[38:28] Civil War is a real thing like they can
[38:31] come together and they can do something
[38:33] against governments uh and also what you
[38:36] said like um that that the neighborhoods
[38:39] you you don't know which neighbor has a
[38:41] gun and which one doesn't that's a
[38:44] that's really good protection I mean
[38:46] there's also like Bitcoin you need it
[38:49] for monetary things and then a gun for
[38:51] for physical things absolutely because
[38:54] we live in the physical world and that's
[38:56] something that that crypto people maybe
[38:59] scammers don't understand and some naive
[39:01] speculators and investors don't
[39:03] understand there's a digital world where
[39:06] Bitcoin can give you freedom and rights
[39:09] and then there's physical world where
[39:12] that's separate so for example can't put
[39:16] real estate on the blockchain or gold on
[39:19] the blockchain it doesn't make any sense
[39:21] or IBM blockchain um ran ran ads IBM ran
[39:26] ads for IBM blockchain during the US
[39:28] Super Bowl what we call football what
[39:30] you guys call or whatever you call
[39:33] it um and they're trying to put tomatoes
[39:38] on the blockchain doesn't make any sense
[39:40] because anybody in person could pretend
[39:43] that these are organic Tomatoes no GMOs
[39:47] or whatever but actually they are
[39:51] inorganic and have GMOs and just lie
[39:54] because you know just because you tag
[39:56] something saying not GMO free and
[39:59] organic doesn't mean it is when someone
[40:02] could just swap it out for something
[40:03] that's you know has
[40:06] pesticides do you think we because you
[40:09] mentioned scams a lot do you think we
[40:11] get rid of all the scams at some point
[40:14] that's not realistic all we want to do
[40:17] and I'm a big proponent of scams again
[40:21] big proponent of reducing or lessening
[40:24] scams on bitcoin or off Bitcoin coin but
[40:28] I really care about less scams on
[40:31] bitcoin meaning for example right now if
[40:33] you go to ordinals decom you can look up
[40:36] all sorts of offensive things so they'll
[40:40] have kill the nword kill President kill
[40:47] presidential candidate or I
[40:51] love a fascist or communist dictator
[40:55] just all sorts of offensive speech and
[40:57] speech and you can do these things and I
[40:59] post about it on Twitter at T Clubhouse
[41:01] sorry to promote again T and Clubhouse I
[41:04] posted about this but you know for your
[41:06] audience because there are a lot of
[41:07] Europeans and we Americans are too crft
[41:10] and too rash and so trying to be polite
[41:16] but you can look this up it's ridiculous
[41:18] the amount of stuff that is permanently
[41:21] on the Bitcoin blockchain you have C
[41:24] ticks you have dick derer conun I'll
[41:29] just say all sorts of ridiculous things
[41:33] that where they're trying to scam us and
[41:35] other retail and do a rug pole and pump
[41:38] and do the reason it's bad for Bitcoin
[41:41] is to increase the blo on the blockchain
[41:43] increases the attack Surface by having
[41:46] gate speech child porn or state secrets
[41:50] and nuclear bombs and nuclear codes or
[41:53] how to build a bomb how to build machine
[41:55] guns or whatever how to print a 3D
[41:57] machine gun all these things you put on
[41:59] the Bitcoin blockchain just gives the
[42:02] state US government and other
[42:04] authoritarian governments an excuse to
[42:07] not shut down Bitcoin but to ban it and
[42:10] bans can be a little bit effective for
[42:13] those who are law binding ban self-
[42:15] custody ban other things and some people
[42:18] will be like you know what it's not
[42:20] worth it and companies and entities
[42:23] churches nonprofits unions will be
[42:26] reluct to self- custody Bitcoin because
[42:29] it's illegal right and you just don't
[42:32] want to give the state reasons to attack
[42:35] Bitcoin so these SCS are attacks on
[42:39] bitcoin they're on
[42:40] bitcoin and they also attacks when
[42:44] they're off Bitcoin but I don't want to
[42:45] talk about that right now this the scams
[42:47] on bitcoin are attack also because they
[42:50] ruin bitcoin's brand because they make
[42:53] Bitcoin look like ethereum and salana
[42:56] but like incompetent versions because
[42:59] you can't make money as a scammer or
[43:02] early Speculator even if you're not a
[43:04] scammer just early speculating on these
[43:07] scams because there's no demand for it
[43:09] that's
[43:10] why except when they're trying to you
[43:14] know temporarily for a couple minutes or
[43:18] a couple weeks or a couple
[43:20] months log the Bitcoin block space with
[43:23] Spam and scam they can increase the fees
[43:27] but only for a couple months look at
[43:29] what happened at the having the having
[43:31] transaction fees were through the
[43:33] roof people were
[43:35] threatening and taunting us that this
[43:38] would be your last chance to consolidate
[43:40] your utxos that there was permanently
[43:43] going to be high demand for spam and
[43:46] spam on bitcoin and there's nothing you
[43:47] can do about it all this art and nfts on
[43:50] bitcoin and it died down and fees were
[43:52] under 40 cents for a long time per
[43:55] transaction
[43:57] so you just cannot have you want to
[44:00] reduce scams on bitcoin because it ruins
[44:02] bitcoin's brand and makes Bitcoin
[44:04] indistinguishable from ethereum except
[44:06] for Bitcoin is hard credly finite and
[44:09] just like a bad verion ethereum poor man
[44:12] shitcoin launcher and salana right now
[44:16] is the mean coin launcher of choice and
[44:18] Bitcoin has mean coins on top of it but
[44:20] they're unsuccessful again so even if
[44:23] you're a
[44:24] scammer because is it worth
[44:27] to be derided and Bitcoin traded by
[44:30] people like myself and Special Forces
[44:33] Unit of
[44:35] many or or not many but several dozen at
[44:39] least bitcoiners for hardcore and want
[44:42] less B you're never going to stop it but
[44:45] it's not about stopping you're never
[44:46] going to stop mder that doesn't mean you
[44:48] don't want to try to reduce the amount
[44:50] of mder so it's pretty ridiculous you
[44:54] spam enablers and scam enablers to say
[44:56] well you haven't stopped the scams so
[44:59] you lost I would say scammers lost and
[45:02] the spam scam enablers lost because not
[45:06] only did they not make
[45:08] money doing this but their reputations
[45:11] are forever tarnished as supporting scam
[45:14] because a lot of my fellow anti-cam
[45:17] people take screenshots and use Wayback
[45:20] machines so is it worth it for you as a
[45:23] bitcoiner to try to make an extra dollar
[45:26] or an extra Bitcoin or extra few Satoshi
[45:29] to scam on bitcoin so you can scam
[45:32] retail the Working Poor so that you can
[45:36] buy more Bitcoin for yourself it's
[45:38] disgusting they should stop but you know
[45:41] we know some of them won't so we just
[45:43] have to make it not worth their want and
[45:45] point out that people keep losing money
[45:48] scamming on bitcoin you can go to
[45:50] ordinal stom you magic Eden coin market
[45:54] cap trading view look up all these scams
[45:58] and the only scams that are transitorily
[46:00] succeeding are the
[46:03] Insiders and expert scammers on top of
[46:07] salana and ethereum the Bitcoin scammers
[46:09] are
[46:11] incompetent and
[46:12] unethical which is like a not a double
[46:15] negative but it makes me respect them
[46:17] even less if you're going to scam people
[46:20] you need to do it like CZ get away with
[46:22] $30 billion pay a small well for him a
[46:25] small fine of tens of Millions or
[46:27] whatever it was not go to jail go to
[46:29] jail for two months and retire with 30
[46:32] freaking billion dollars or whatever
[46:34] Prime pays if you're good at it
[46:36] unfortunately Prime doesn't pay if
[46:39] you're bad at it and you ruin your
[46:40] reputation you look ridiculous just look
[46:43] like a
[46:45] clown because you're unconfident and a
[46:49] dick for scamming people I'm sorry I
[46:52] used to work on the Wall Street trading
[46:53] floor I went as long as I could without
[46:55] cussing I'm sorry Rob
[46:57] feel free to censor this no worries it's
[47:00] your show you can filter I'm for
[47:04] filters I I I usually don't filter I I I
[47:08] never filter actually I only do it when
[47:11] no I actually never did it I always
[47:15] off
[47:17] yeah that that was worse on on on on the
[47:20] podcast already wow oh okay okay but uh
[47:24] the question I was asking is like
[47:27] what what can we as the the random the
[47:30] random Bitcoin do against yeah sure
[47:33] against scams or yeah against scams
[47:37] against that I think um if you're on
[47:40] bitcoin you don't even have to tweet
[47:41] just like my tweets like the tweets of
[47:44] other bitcoiners who call out scams give
[47:50] a like Emoji or hard Emoji when we're
[47:52] calling out scams on Spaces whether it's
[47:56] crypto space spaces or Bitcoin
[47:59] spaces and you know don't let your
[48:01] friends and family or your neighbor
[48:04] coworker fellow Church grer whatever
[48:07] don't let them lose money to scans
[48:11] because it makes Bitcoin look ridiculous
[48:13] okay so I'm G to tell you a quick
[48:15] story I have a Harvard Law classmate I
[48:18] went to Harvard Law School so name
[48:19] dropping because you know I'm
[48:21] amican also my ego and then I have um an
[48:25] immediate family member
[48:28] just a few months
[48:30] ago not very long ago maybe few to
[48:33] several months ago I talked about
[48:35] Bitcoin and they said isn't that a scam
[48:37] or that's scammy right even after
[48:40] Fidelity and black rock announced they
[48:42] hadn't launched yet I believe their
[48:45] Bitcoin ETFs to the most reputable
[48:49] biggest most credible institutional
[48:52] players financial institutions in the
[48:55] world that these people who are normies
[49:00] no coiners whatever would respect
[49:03] according to them black rock and
[49:05] Fidelity are credible right not
[49:07] according to bitcoiners system so it's
[49:10] just the the lack of Education the lack
[49:12] of awareness is just stunning and the
[49:15] more the longer we let scams continue
[49:17] whether it's on bitcoin or off Bitcoin
[49:20] the worse it is because it it becomes
[49:22] ingrained in people's head that hey not
[49:25] only did my sister lots money and scams
[49:29] on bitcoin or crypto scams but also my
[49:32] aunt my uncle my grandpa my neighbor my
[49:37] uh my neighbor you know best friends my
[49:41] best friend my classmate everybody's
[49:43] losing money on these crypto scams on or
[49:46] off Bitcoin so the more you have people
[49:49] get rful the more Bitcoin is going to be
[49:52] compared to crypto and Bitcoin is
[49:55] astronomy crypto as astrology I'm sorry
[49:59] there is no
[50:01] uniquely valuable use case for any
[50:05] cryptos except for Bitcoin tether
[50:08] transitorily temporarily has a use case
[50:12] as kind of a bridge between Fiat and the
[50:17] Bitcoin world so that people living in
[50:21] countries of horrible currencies
[50:23] Zimbabwe and others they can transact
[50:26] and something that's a shortterm sore
[50:29] value not longterm s yeah very true I I
[50:35] I'm always ashamed that I had a shitcoin
[50:36] face but I'm very happy that I'm over
[50:39] that since a long time now it's like
[50:42] everyone has uh I feel like everyone
[50:48] has
[50:51] I um he did not coin but he got it
[50:55] right away but I sh shitcoin I shitcoin
[50:58] even in 2021 I apologize for it I did
[51:01] Big clout and nfts which is like a
[51:04] double negative like two two horrible
[51:06] things one one worse than the other and
[51:09] um partly to support or enlarge part to
[51:14] support an artist that I was close
[51:18] to who could not tour or make money
[51:22] during the pandemic because of lockdown
[51:25] yeah absolutely
[51:27] uh we we all almost
[51:31] all when people when people outside of
[51:33] Stefan laa and a few others if someone
[51:36] says they never shitcoin I don't believe
[51:39] them I think they're ly or tutional or
[51:41] have selective memory I true that's very
[51:45] true I you like before your shitcoin
[51:48] face like you you will enter it soon or
[51:50] you lied or there are some some
[51:52] exception of course yeah really
[51:54] interesting one last topic that because
[51:56] we already closing to the to the one
[51:58] hour mark you mentioned it a little bit
[52:00] with with privacy um do you feel there's
[52:03] a war on privacy on individual Freedom
[52:07] rights and all all those things yes it
[52:10] is the in in the interests of the CIA
[52:13] NSA US Government
[52:16] generally and intelligence agencies
[52:18] around the world and governments
[52:21] around as well as central banks I think
[52:25] I need a think think about that more and
[52:28] definitely many big
[52:30] Corporation whether it's Google meta
[52:34] open or Microsoft it's in their interest
[52:38] to break privacy because they want to
[52:40] know what we're doing so they can make
[52:41] more money right even Apple so Apple
[52:45] might be a little better about
[52:47] protecting your privacy from third
[52:49] parties unless maybe they get paid a lot
[52:51] of money but you know they want your
[52:54] information so they know what's going
[52:56] not I mean maybe opt out but I think
[52:59] some of their defaults could be greatly
[53:01] improved so yeah there's a war in
[53:04] privacy um theater Bob of all people and
[53:07] I've had my battles with him he's a
[53:10] total jerk sometimes and a little bit
[53:13] crazy but he just tweeted out something
[53:16] that made me think and realized that I
[53:19] didn't quite understand privacy in
[53:21] Bitcoin as well as I thought I did
[53:24] because you know developers talk about
[53:26] you know we want unchain privacy we want
[53:28] more engineering capacity and I respect
[53:30] that not sure where I come down on it
[53:33] pretty close to the pro alific Camp I'm
[53:36] really in the very slow and steady camp
[53:39] we need a lot of code review we can't
[53:41] afford a third inflation bug and a
[53:45] nine-year span right we've already had
[53:48] two like I'd like to go nine years
[53:51] without another inflation bug however
[53:53] difficult it is to execute and our last
[53:55] one would was disc CED in I believe 2018
[53:58] anyway so privacy what deer Bob said
[54:03] is if you send Bitcoin to a new address
[54:10] nobody knows except you if you control
[54:13] that new address so that's privacy for
[54:16] you because you could say oh I sent it
[54:18] to someone and I don't know why it
[54:21] hasn't moved but you know they have it I
[54:23] don't have it right it I don't control
[54:25] that address are you GNA prove that you
[54:28] Robin control a new address how is
[54:33] someone going to prove that the state or
[54:35] you know someone trying to invade your
[54:37] privacy so you can help create privacy
[54:39] that way and then from that even from
[54:42] that new address you can just send it to
[54:44] a new address and then that new address
[54:45] sends it to yet another new address so
[54:47] you have this daisy chain of new address
[54:50] that nobody knows I mean maybe you
[54:53] control all 10 addresses by the time you
[54:55] send it right 10 times down down the
[54:59] chain but um maybe you still control it
[55:02] but maybe you don'tbe you have no
[55:05] relationship at all know after the first
[55:08] transaction to all the down chain
[55:11] transactions because it just keeps
[55:13] hearing you move to a new Mar does that
[55:15] make sense it makes a lot of sense
[55:17] because um like let's play the game like
[55:21] I don't know in Austria the government
[55:22] is going crazy and they exposing I don't
[55:26] know like 50% tax on on bitcoin uh and
[55:29] and then I'm like okay how do I get out
[55:31] of this mess they have maybe an exit tax
[55:33] and all the things they're not in place
[55:35] of course right now but let's say they
[55:37] have it the the last resort in in
[55:40] Bitcoin is like you can say that they
[55:43] have been stolen you have been hacked
[55:45] and then all your Bitcoin go to one
[55:47] address uh and nobody can
[55:51] really say if you control that address
[55:55] or not like you could actually be hacked
[55:58] by by someone uh and then this someone
[56:01] afterwards spens his those Bitcoin in I
[56:04] don't know El Salvador um but this
[56:07] doesn't has to be you and that's a
[56:09] really interesting point like it shifts
[56:11] the total control of the Bitcoin like I
[56:14] I love the extreme examp yeah I love the
[56:17] extreme examples even if like if someone
[56:20] comes to your house uh they can shoot
[56:23] you take your house they can shoot you
[56:24] they take your gold they can shoot you
[56:26] take everything but with Bitcoin you
[56:28] have the choice if you give it to them
[56:31] or not they can still shoot you but but
[56:35] but you can uh you decide if you give
[56:37] them the Bitcoin or not and I think
[56:39] that's something so simple in Bitcoin
[56:43] when once you get Bitcoin but that's a
[56:46] thing that a lot of normies don't get
[56:47] and this is amazing when I tell this
[56:49] someone that doesn't get Bitcoin at all
[56:52] they're like what that that's actually I
[56:54] can save my Bitcoin in my head they they
[56:56] amazed but that fact we Bitcoin know
[56:58] that that we can just save Bitcoin in
[57:00] the head but nor don't know
[57:02] that and also the no we we we can do a
[57:05] better job I think we can always improve
[57:08] and talk to more normies meet them where
[57:11] they're at and explain things in simple
[57:13] ways like you just need to memorize 12
[57:18] words and you'll own Bitcoin and control
[57:21] it and no one can take it from you and
[57:23] maybe you have a backup um story
[57:26] somewhere at your mom's home in the
[57:29] basement somewhere something a backup
[57:32] copy just like you have a backup copy of
[57:35] your you know house key and three multi
[57:39] or multisig is very
[57:41] interesting yeah I think uh once you get
[57:44] to a certain amount of Bitcoin um you
[57:47] should definitely check out multi and
[57:49] see what what you can do but the but the
[57:51] thing I wanted to bring up is like you
[57:54] mentioned before uh um planes and trying
[57:58] to get gold with planes from from from
[58:01] Los Angeles to Austria that is so easy
[58:04] with Bitcoin like you can if you minutes
[58:08] it's so easy see yeah if you try to do
[58:12] this with like gold or anything else
[58:14] like they assume that you're a criminal
[58:16] as you said before they they will
[58:17] confiscate they will take you with
[58:20] Bitcoin you can just
[58:21] remember your seed phrase and you go go
[58:25] over the borders then put there in a
[58:27] save multi signature so that's that's
[58:29] really cool uh but yeah closer coming to
[58:32] the end as we already at the one hour
[58:34] Mark um I have one question the end that
[58:37] all my guests are getting um what can we
[58:40] learn from you besides all the things
[58:42] that we already talked about sure so
[58:45] number one please follow me at Ty on
[58:48] clubhouse on Twitter to learn my latest
[58:52] thinking I'm constantly learning and de
[58:56] veloping my thoughts into kind of
[59:00] something that's more organized for
[59:03] podcast and I hope someday more essays
[59:07] but um Twitter is my test net so go to
[59:10] Ty and Clubhouse to learn what I'm
[59:12] thinking but in terms of what else you
[59:14] can learn go to the swan. comom website
[59:18] where I'm now strategic advisor so I'm
[59:20] kind of more on the outside but helping
[59:22] with uh things like fundraising media
[59:25] and some other things that'll be maybe
[59:27] revealed in the future um that's a lot
[59:30] of fun and natural for me I don't even
[59:32] consider work to Hest don't tell
[59:36] Corey but um uh
[59:39] basically
[59:40] um at sw.com you should be able to find
[59:44] some of the essays that I've written
[59:46] that really Tomy
[59:48] stroli um who is our editor and chief of
[59:53] um Swan private newsletter and other
[59:55] things he's such a phenomenal writer he
[59:57] really rewrote my um my essay because
[60:01] the ideas were sort of there they
[60:03] weren't clear and he made it much better
[60:05] so I've talked about Bitcoin and Wall
[60:07] Street Wall Street
[60:09] Bitcoin and um I do think that if you
[60:16] are open to it people can DM me to ask
[60:20] me more about my thoughts on reducing
[60:24] scams on bitcoin and why Bitcoin is my
[60:28] hard
[60:29] money that is going to make number go up
[60:32] so if you want if all you do is care
[60:35] about Vice and making money in a risk
[60:38] adjusted manner or even not risk
[60:40] adjusted just making more wealth buy
[60:43] Bitcoin and come help us protect Bitcoin
[60:47] from scams on and off Bitcoin especially
[60:49] crypto scams and scams on bitcoin so
[60:52] those are kind of where you can find
[60:55] find me there there are some YouTube
[60:57] interviews some of them are out of date
[60:59] where I talk to Bloomberg talk to Yahoo
[61:02] finance
[61:03] NASDAQ and have done podcasts thanks to
[61:06] in large part
[61:07] to Swan and and Cory clipston we had the
[61:11] foresight to understand that Bitcoin PR
[61:14] is very important so we actually spend
[61:17] money on PR and the work of Moos PR PR
[61:20] firm getting me those gigs so very
[61:24] important but but some of those a bit
[61:26] outdated but you can see the evolution
[61:28] of my thinking or feel free to call me
[61:30] out and challenge me um publicly or
[61:32] preferably if you're nice on privately D
[61:36] DM uh at T Clubhouse and um yeah I do
[61:42] check um DMS from non people I don't
[61:45] follow from time to time so might take
[61:47] me a little bit of a while but
[61:49] fortunately I'm at the point where now
[61:50] where most of the scammers try
[61:55] get me to
[61:57] buy crypto scams when they DM me on
[62:00] Twitter they're filtered out so I'm able
[62:02] to see the nine followers I'll follow
[62:06] you that and then we can communicate
[62:08] more easily amazing yeah perfect thank
[62:11] you already we have one last question uh
[62:14] the Andro team question uh where the
[62:16] previous guest is asking a question for
[62:18] you uh without knowing who the next is
[62:20] that's the end routine uh the question
[62:23] is sorry who who asked uh the the
[62:26] previous guest always so the always the
[62:29] previous guest is asking without knowing
[62:31] who oh I see got it oh I love that okay
[62:34] okay perfect and your question from the
[62:35] previous guest is what do you usually
[62:38] recommend when a Nori asks you what
[62:41] allocation to bitcoin is optimal sure
[62:44] number one the key is to never sell
[62:46] because Bitcoin will continue to do what
[62:49] it's always done which is outperform
[62:51] every other major asset almost all years
[62:55] yes some Years it'll be ranked number 10
[62:57] out of 10 but most Years it'll be number
[63:00] one out of 10 so number one don't sell
[63:03] number
[63:04] two um Lynn Alden and haori who is CIO
[63:09] at Swan Mining and former rman Sachs
[63:13] Marl Lynch a very successful guy they
[63:17] both talk about how you don't really
[63:19] need a lot of
[63:21] Bitcoin as a percentage if you never
[63:25] sell it
[63:26] can sell other things real estate your
[63:28] bonds your cash your stocks your Nvidia
[63:31] uh ETF whatever um so I think you start
[63:35] with a low amount but not too low that
[63:38] you don't take it seriously but enough
[63:40] that it hurts you'll be mad at me or
[63:44] whoever or maybe Robin for a day because
[63:47] you watch this podcast and bought you
[63:48] know some Bitcoin $1,000 worth $100
[63:51] worth whatever it is that hurts but it's
[63:54] not too much that you lose sleeve that's
[63:57] not worth it but you want to buy enough
[63:58] to start with that you will read books
[64:02] and listen to podcast listen to maybe
[64:05] all 200 some of your podcasts when
[64:07] you're stuck in LA traffic or if you are
[64:09] at 2x speed one half xped so you get
[64:12] educated about Bitcoin because you now
[64:15] have skin in the game and hopefully if
[64:17] we do a good job you at least ask
[64:20] questions or just start increasing your
[64:22] Bitcoin allocation maybe it'll go down
[64:24] the rabbit hole like Michael sailor
[64:26] after listening to bre love and reading
[64:28] bre love stuff and listening to safine
[64:30] and reading the Bitcoin standard you'll
[64:33] just go down a deep rabbit hole for
[64:35] months come out of it and just be like
[64:37] being 100% of my net worth in the
[64:40] Bitcoin or whatever you did so I think
[64:42] it's as much as you can without selling
[64:45] it meaning you have to understand it and
[64:49] you have to understand yourself because
[64:52] 2% could be a lot for somebody who's
[64:54] very risk losing sleep every night it's
[64:58] just not worth it maybe it should be at
[65:01] 0.2% but I'm exaggerating but um not
[65:04] everybody should be at 100% even if they
[65:07] can afford to do it because um it's too
[65:12] nervous it makes you too nervous and
[65:14] you're going to sell at the low the
[65:16] other type of person that should not be
[65:18] overallocated Bitcoin is people with
[65:20] negative cash flow or who are one layoff
[65:23] or firing away from
[65:26] having uh tremendous Financial stress
[65:30] one medical emergency away from having
[65:32] tremendous Financial stress it's just
[65:34] not worth it maybe 70% allocation of
[65:37] Bitcoin is good enough look in the long
[65:39] run maybe not us but your kids and your
[65:43] grandkids and I guarantee you your great
[65:45] great great grand kids are going to be
[65:47] fantastically wealthy and your problem
[65:50] will be how do you leave a legacy of
[65:53] civic responsibility and caring about
[65:55] your fellow man or woman or human being
[65:58] whatever gender I don't care um you want
[66:02] someone who is going to be a good person
[66:04] and help other human being I'm here for
[66:08] people I don't care about entities I
[66:10] don't care about unions I don't care
[66:12] about corporations I don't care about
[66:13] Wall Street I definitely don't care
[66:15] about government I want people to win
[66:19] Bitcoin is our ticket to freedom for all
[66:23] if we play our cards right it's going to
[66:25] be tough because cbdcs are coming
[66:27] digital surveillance is coming closed AI
[66:30] is coming so we have all these things
[66:33] that are security and privacy invasions
[66:35] all these things that are anti- people
[66:37] and anti- freedom we really need a hard
