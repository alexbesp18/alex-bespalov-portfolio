[00:00] the traditional protection is gold and
[00:02] the more recent version is Bitcoin proof
[00:04] of stake is like a company and proof of
[00:07] work is something completely different
[00:08] but I think you could admire both for
[00:10] what they are for different reasons
[00:11] we've got ethereum which is the post
[00:13] office I go there to post my dollars
[00:15] post my nfts post my contracts as you
[00:17] said proof of stake it's kind of like a
[00:20] company like an illegal security should
[00:22] not be there because I personally don't
[00:24] see a use case all the nfts they are
[00:26] based on blockchain and blockchain is
[00:28] really an really inefficient way to to
[00:30] store and save stuff I don't see a value
[00:33] in any altcoin I'm not a bitcoiner I'm
[00:35] not a gold person I'm not a fe guy I'm
[00:37] in the middle of all of these groups
[00:38] with absolutely no
[00:41] friends how did you like before we get
[00:43] in the whole Bitcoin and gold uh in
[00:46] topics and what's the problem with the
[00:48] current Financial system I would like to
[00:51] know like how did you first get started
[00:53] with investing how did you go uh down
[00:57] the road with finding gold later find
[01:00] Bitcoin and finding the way to saving
[01:03] your money outside of the Fiat
[01:06] system so I had a bit of time in the mid
[01:08] 90s when I was I was about 25 u in fact
[01:12] before that when I was a student that we
[01:13] were in the UK we were doing
[01:15] privatizations the government was
[01:16] selling the water companies the
[01:17] electricity companies even BP lots of
[01:20] different things and the public was
[01:23] encouraged to get involved and the bank
[01:24] would lend you money you could buy
[01:26] shares they would go up and um it was
[01:28] quite fun it was a fun you know the
[01:29] early 90s so and the late 80s so I did a
[01:32] couple of those government
[01:34] privatizations that got me interested in
[01:36] the stock market and then um I joined
[01:40] the I joined HSBC in
[01:42] 1998 um having been I did some time in
[01:44] the Army British Army and after that I
[01:46] joined HSBC in the asset
[01:48] management and I came across gold in the
[01:51] late 90s and the price was 250
[01:55] 55 and um I had a presentation from
[01:57] toille Asset Management a Canadian
[01:59] company company and I heard this
[02:01] contrarian idea saying it's the end of
[02:04] the low end of this down cycle 20 years
[02:06] of falling prices of course gold wasn't
[02:08] falling in every currency and it was
[02:10] going up in Mexican pesos and Turkish L
[02:13] and all that um but but it was falling
[02:16] in dollars and stuff and Deutsch marks
[02:18] and
[02:19] um and I became interested in gold in
[02:23] 1999 um and and I became a professional
[02:26] investor in Gold over the next 25 years
[02:29] and then about 2012 I came across
[02:31] Bitcoin and I said it was a ridiculous
[02:34] idea you can cut and paste it and U then
[02:37] I realized I was wrong and so I became a
[02:39] bull in
[02:42] 2013 oh 13 that's uh really like you
[02:45] realized it really early on like how did
[02:47] you came into that and realize it I
[02:50] think I'm really
[02:52] late in 2013
[02:55] wow I think even now people that are
[02:58] coming in I
[03:00] yeah it's interesting up 1500 times when
[03:05] I arrived I mean from starting from from
[03:08] from zero like the then you were really
[03:10] late into gold when you look at it like
[03:13] that that's very good
[03:21] point I mean you you weren't around with
[03:25] when gold was was was there but yeah um
[03:28] I think gold
[03:30] uh buck and also Bitcoin Maxes however
[03:32] you want to call call them they both
[03:35] have one big similarity like both are
[03:38] really heavy like the they always
[03:41] describe the problem the The Current
[03:43] financial system uh quite the same like
[03:47] I before I started investing I was uh
[03:50] into stocks and then through stocks I
[03:53] learned about Bitcoin and before I did
[03:56] not notice like what is money what's the
[03:58] current Financial system I just this uh
[04:00] I just was in in stocks and with Bitcoin
[04:03] I learned about gold also and I learn
[04:05] about the value of gold and I learn
[04:08] about the current Financial system and
[04:10] what's what's wrong with our money like
[04:12] how would you describe it what's wrong
[04:14] with fear system why are you in Bitcoin
[04:17] and gold and and yeah like why are you
[04:21] protecting your financial energy with
[04:23] Bitcoin and gold I mean it's a good
[04:25] question but I think you know we invest
[04:27] in the stock market and we invest in
[04:29] Bitcoin and gold for kind of the same
[04:31] reasons but at different times
[04:34] really um but but you know no one denies
[04:39] that that fat money is going down yeah
[04:41] it's a question of how quickly it's
[04:42] going down and that's inflation High
[04:44] inflation means it's going down very
[04:45] quickly low inflation means it's going
[04:47] down slowly but it's always going down
[04:50] and that's kind of the design of the
[04:51] system you know it's this idea it's an
[04:53] incentive to borrow to invest and to uh
[04:57] you know put the money to work so it's
[04:58] not all bad bad the theat system but I
[05:01] think that in recent years they they are
[05:04] um the central banks really aren't
[05:06] aren't looking after the money in the
[05:08] way they could to so you know if you go
[05:10] back to the 60s 70s um 80s the deuts
[05:14] mark and the Swiss well the deuts mark
[05:16] really and and maybe the Yen too were
[05:19] very very well looked after by their
[05:21] central banks they were store of value
[05:23] the pound was going down the dollar was
[05:25] bouncing high and low as it always does
[05:28] um but there were good currencies there
[05:29] were bad currencies in the Emerging
[05:31] Markets we had you know very bad
[05:33] currencies the South African rand in the
[05:35] 80s 90s was very very weak um Mexican
[05:39] and so forth and it's just a question of
[05:42] you know if you have interest rates high
[05:44] enough above inflation and you have a
[05:45] real rate of return then the fat
[05:48] system's okay but there's always the
[05:51] Temptation for the politician to keep
[05:53] the interest rates down progrowth policy
[05:56] you know who cares about the value of
[05:58] the money uh just let that go down try
[06:01] and keep the electorate happy and so if
[06:04] you understand that then you realize
[06:05] that you have to protect yourself
[06:07] against it and the um traditional
[06:10] protection is gold and um and the you
[06:14] know the more recent version is Bitcoin
[06:17] they're different we'll get into that're
[06:19] I think they're economically more or
[06:21] less the same physically they're very
[06:23] very different um so that's kind of
[06:26] obvious um I I've sort of figured out a
[06:28] way to put them together and hopefully
[06:30] we'll get to that as well but I suppose
[06:33] you know I think a portfolio should have
[06:35] different things in it that's the whole
[06:37] point of diversification if you have a
[06:39] portfolio with 10 things and all of them
[06:41] are up on one day then you'll be lucky
[06:43] if it goes up again tomorrow because you
[06:45] know normally these things work in
[06:47] different ways so you should hope that
[06:48] some of the things in your portfolio
[06:50] aren't doing well and some of the things
[06:51] are doing well because that means you're
[06:53] Diversified and um so so you want some
[06:55] risk and then you want some Safe Haven
[06:58] and uh Bitcoin and gold are both Safe
[07:00] Haven in different ways at different
[07:02] times and I think to illustrate that you
[07:04] obviously I think gold people kind of
[07:05] know it's a safe haven but with Bitcoin
[07:07] you know when the banks went down in q1
[07:11] 2023 Bitcoin went up and I think that
[07:14] was a very exciting moment for the uh uh
[07:16] for the bitcoiners because you recognize
[07:18] that actually Bitcoin is correlated with
[07:21] banking stocks you know it likes
[07:22] interest rates to go up it likes
[07:25] inflation to go up bit like Banks you
[07:27] know and um
[07:29] that's very very interesting that that
[07:31] when when the um U that the Bitcoin kind
[07:34] of behaves like a bank but when all the
[07:36] banks were in trouble Bitcoin went up so
[07:38] it kind of turned told you what you
[07:39] already knew which was this is the
[07:41] future of
[07:43] money yeah it's like yeah yeah before we
[07:47] get more into Bitcoin and gold I want to
[07:49] stay a little bit with the the fat
[07:51] system do you think it will always uh
[07:53] stick around like will it be always uh
[07:56] just be there or will it be repurposed
[07:59] will it be backed by Bitcoin or gold
[08:01] again will it be completely gone and we
[08:03] have one like gold packed or Bitcoin
[08:06] packed
[08:08] system um I think the faar system um
[08:11] will always go through change but I
[08:13] think it can survive in the long term it
[08:15] doesn't mean to say that the pound
[08:16] dollar euro is going to be um useful I
[08:19] me it's going to be going down all the
[08:20] time and and it can keep on going down
[08:23] yeah that's okay you just put another
[08:24] zero on the Note we've seen this before
[08:26] but you know it's not going to be a good
[08:28] story of value but the system can
[08:29] survive let's go back to the gold
[08:32] standard I mean if we if if we think
[08:35] what is you know what is money the 100
[08:37] years ago um or 500 years ago we tend to
[08:40] think of it as
[08:42] physical and you know a simple system
[08:44] but I think that if you go back 2,000
[08:47] years to the Romans or whatever or even
[08:49] the ancient Greeks when they start
[08:51] digging the archaeologists start digging
[08:53] they find the beans they find the coins
[08:56] they never find the yield curve you know
[08:58] there was was a system of credit at the
[09:01] time you can't bury a yield curve right
[09:04] the IUS between people but there was one
[09:08] so you know we've got to remember that
[09:09] and and these people weren't primitive
[09:11] and systems of credit have have existed
[09:13] for uh a very very long time we all like
[09:16] to think it was barter but it wasn't it
[09:19] was always more sophisticated than that
[09:20] you know people aren't stupid they never
[09:22] were stupid and so there was always IUS
[09:25] and um and creative systems more
[09:27] creative than we think but if we come
[09:30] back to more recent history let's say
[09:31] the 1950s 60s or even the 19th century
[09:35] or whatever what is gold it's a fintech
[09:39] it's the original Financial technology
[09:42] it's got a very high density of
[09:44] 19.3 is shiny uh ladies like it and all
[09:48] that and so if I go in a ship to the
[09:51] other side of the world and trade a 100
[09:53] years ago my goal is a financial
[09:56] technology because I can get to Japan or
[09:58] China and they go Ah that's gold no
[10:01] problem Global store of value I get that
[10:04] it's the same price in Amsterdam as it
[10:05] is in
[10:06] Shanghai and and it works and people
[10:09] will say tungsten well tungsten's 19 not
[10:12] 19.3 and it's not gold and shiny and you
[10:15] can very easily test uh the difference
[10:18] for these things so gold was the
[10:20] original Financial technology and it's
[10:23] quite interesting that the gold standard
[10:25] ended in the early 70s you know what
[10:27] happened in the early' 70s
[10:30] computers International telephones you
[10:34] know in a way that they didn't exist 30
[10:36] years 20 years before was radios and you
[10:38] know Telegraph
[10:40] and and then suddenly in the 70s you
[10:43] have these very powerful global system
[10:45] of telecommunications and Computing
[10:48] which enables the theat system so the so
[10:51] to answer your question a moment ago
[10:52] about the Fiat system partly there's the
[10:55] real interest rate side are the central
[10:57] Bankers looking after the fat currency
[10:59] and there's also the tech side you
[11:00] couldn't have had a feat system in an
[11:02] era without decent technology you've got
[11:05] to have the real time price feed there
[11:08] is no fix there is no fix or reference
[11:10] to gold and so therefore um the fat
[11:13] system or the gold standard died and the
[11:16] fat system took over 50 years ago
[11:18] because it could technology allowed it
[11:20] to and I think that's a point that's a
[11:23] lot of people haven't understood you
[11:25] know fear we didn't get fear we thought
[11:27] it was better it just it finally could
[11:29] arrive it couldn't have arrived before
[11:31] so it's been around 50 years um or 52
[11:34] years and it kind of works it's not
[11:38] chaos life's quite good but it but it's
[11:41] not a good store of value it's not a
[11:42] good investment yeah and even today
[11:45] people say 5% interest great well
[11:48] congratulations so after tax five
[11:50] becomes two and a half and um and after
[11:53] inflation it becomes zero so there is no
[11:55] real return on a bank deposit after tax
[12:00] yeah I mean fear kind of works and it's
[12:03] many it also depends kind of where are
[12:05] you're living like there are unbanked
[12:07] people that really need a alternative
[12:09] system but uh in in our Western World
[12:13] and like for me I'm in Austria it works
[12:15] like I get a salary I can pay of course
[12:18] I lose my purchasing power over time but
[12:20] in in that regard in some like some or
[12:24] most of the region in the world it it
[12:26] works um and why you I'll make a point
[12:31] there because what you're saying is that
[12:33] the fat fat your your Euro has got zero
[12:37] zero volatility in
[12:39] Austria my pound has zero volatility in
[12:42] the UK my pound has 8% volatility if I
[12:45] come to Austra yeah and so it starts to
[12:48] become a different thing as you as you
[12:50] leave your own um Shores and then if you
[12:53] go to Nigeria or to um Argentina or
[12:56] turkey suddenly you're face with much
[12:58] higher inflation
[13:00] now there's still zero inflation okay
[13:03] maybe not in Argentina but but in but in
[13:05] if your inflation sort of under 50% you
[13:08] know you don't notice it in one week one
[13:11] day one week you notice it in a month
[13:13] two months and if your inflation is 160
[13:16] like Argentina you notice it in one
[13:18] week you know here we are in Europe and
[13:21] even if our inflation is um you know
[13:24] five or something we we don't really
[13:25] notice it on a two three week basis so
[13:28] we consider our money or the cash in our
[13:31] pocket to be stable in the short term in
[13:33] a high inflation country currency it's
[13:35] not even stable in the short
[13:37] term yeah I saw some pictures where they
[13:40] have in a restaurant like a card where
[13:42] they put the the prices down and put new
[13:45] prices right next to it because they
[13:47] cannot like they cannot uh switch the
[13:50] cards the menu cards every week uh it's
[13:53] quite quite chaotic and it's quite for
[13:57] for me as an Austrian who only is in
[14:00] like a kind of Western protected world
[14:03] where in the short term there's not as
[14:06] much volatility it's it's kind of hard
[14:07] to imagine um and why like you say now
[14:11] like why do you hold gold and Bitcoin
[14:13] what's your allocation like why like do
[14:16] you go all like most of it at Gold a
[14:18] little bit of Bitcoin uh what's your
[14:21] allocation and strategy looking like
[14:22] there so if so the the the the question
[14:26] is a very good word and why why is we've
[14:29] got the Bold index the Bold index
[14:31] combines uh Bitcoin and gold and what
[14:34] why is the approach what it is which is
[14:36] to U allocate according to risk so let's
[14:40] say I put 50 euros into gold 50 euros
[14:42] into Bitcoin yeah is my portfolio
[14:44] balanced no because we know that uh gold
[14:48] typic on a normal day if gold goes up
[14:50] Bitcoin goes down and vice versa it
[14:52] happens all the time so you know what a
[14:54] good day for Bitcoin is probably a bad
[14:55] day for gold not always but generally
[14:57] speaking so this a beautiful negative
[14:59] correlation between the two low or
[15:01] negative correlation between the assets
[15:04] so 50 50 EUR in Bitcoin is a low is a is
[15:08] way more risky than 50 euros in Gold
[15:10] yeah and you can count that by the by
[15:13] the or measure that by the volatility of
[15:15] the assets and it turns out that if you
[15:17] look at the the volatility of the last
[15:19] year of Bitcoin and gold and we've got
[15:21] some simple mathematics that we have on
[15:23] on our website it's called inverse
[15:26] volatility and basically if you have two
[15:28] two assets of the same volatility the
[15:30] portfolio is 5050 yeah but the
[15:33] difference between Bitcoin and gold at
[15:34] the moment suggests you want to be 25%
[15:37] Bitcoin and 75% goal and if you do that
[15:40] you've got the same amount of risk in
[15:42] each asset not the same amount of money
[15:44] at the same amount of risk so your
[15:46] probability of losing 10 euros out of
[15:48] 100 EUR is the same uh in each asset and
[15:53] that's the point so if you if you
[15:55] balance your portfolio according to risk
[15:57] then you'll end up with lot lot of gold
[15:59] and a little bit of Bitcoin and that's
[16:00] just you know what they've done in trafi
[16:02] with the what they call the risk parity
[16:04] portfolios like Ray Dalia you know he
[16:07] has loads of bonds and a few equities
[16:09] and and and you get you know the similar
[16:11] outcome so it's just taking that simple
[16:13] idea um and um and saying how can we how
[16:16] can we do this um to take a lot of risk
[16:19] out of Bitcoin because let's face it you
[16:22] know B we could all be very bullish on
[16:23] bitcoin and see the future and I'm sure
[16:25] we will agree on many many points it is
[16:28] highly sick Co and it is a scary thing
[16:29] to
[16:30] hold you know I've seen it crash three
[16:33] times spectacularly and so to take some
[16:35] of that I mean it depends and inent if
[16:38] you do blend Bitcoin and gold together
[16:40] um um there there are many other
[16:43] benefits that I'm sure we'll get to but
[16:45] but but it's just you can sleep at night
[16:48] and it's you know crypto could be a very
[16:51] painful place to be
[16:53] sometimes
[16:55] yeah like one question just came in my
[16:58] because you said crypto and I'm always
[17:01] preaching Bitcoin not crypto and for me
[17:03] is like there's a big difference between
[17:05] Bitcoin and crypto and of course you can
[17:06] make a argument that Bitcoin is one
[17:09] cryptocurrency uh but what do you think
[17:12] of altcoins and did you ever touch
[17:14] anyone or did you have always left out
[17:18] the altcoins and state Bitcoin only U
[17:21] outside of gold so B tree uh my company
[17:24] B tree we have a token uh piece of
[17:27] research we have a Bitcoin piece
[17:28] research and we have an altcoin piece of
[17:30] research and I think that uh Bitcoin is
[17:34] like gold it's a neutral um
[17:37] decentralized
[17:39] asset um and I think that the tokens are
[17:43] basically tech stocks so mentally I
[17:46] think of them completely different I
[17:48] think proof of proof of stake is like a
[17:51] company and proof of work is something
[17:53] completely different so I I I totally
[17:56] agree with you but I think you could
[17:57] admire both for what they are for
[17:59] different reasons if you think what is
[18:01] bitcoin well it's 52% of the crypto
[18:05] space ethereum's about 20 stable coins
[18:09] are about 10 so we're now at
[18:11] 80 so all the other stuff is 20% of
[18:16] crypto yeah stable coins e and Bitcoin
[18:19] is 80% and I think people don't really
[18:22] think about that when they talk about it
[18:24] so we're living in a world we got
[18:25] Bitcoin which is the electronic gold the
[18:27] digital gold we've got ethereum which is
[18:29] the post office I go there to post my
[18:32] dollars post my nfts post my contracts
[18:36] yeah in the old days we had an envelope
[18:37] and a stamp young people don't know what
[18:39] that
[18:40] means do you know what a stamp
[18:43] is uh for a letter right yeah used to
[18:48] write a
[18:48] letter give it to a pigeon yeah yeah
[18:51] I I think I put like maybe five stamps
[18:56] in my
[18:57] life so you probably paid fees to
[19:00] ethereum to e and
[19:05] you I
[19:07] had I had eum for like a little bit but
[19:11] uh uh I I dismissed it then it's it's
[19:14] interesting because um the only reason
[19:17] for me for altcoins is another way to
[19:21] get uh Capital like it's an an other
[19:25] system to get Venture Capital to
[19:27] tokenize uh part of your company and
[19:30] bring people to invest in your company
[19:32] because as you said proof of stake it's
[19:35] kind of like a company like this the the
[19:38] staking reward reminds me of a
[19:41] dividend uh the hierarchy reminds me of
[19:44] a stock like proof of stake is not
[19:47] different than just like a stock and
[19:50] then we come to the part where an SEC
[19:53] says oh it's like an illegal security
[19:55] like it it should not should not be
[19:57] there because it like going public
[19:59] requires a lot of regul regulatory uh
[20:03] work and it's really interesting for me
[20:06] to to look at it what can happen with
[20:09] the altcoins I personally don't see a
[20:11] use case a really good one uh because
[20:13] also the all the nfts they are based on
[20:16] blockchain and blockchain is really an
[20:18] really inefficient way to to to store
[20:21] and save stuff uh it's only uh good if
[20:26] it's like a ledger like with Bitcoin for
[20:28] me is money the only use case for public
[20:32] Ledger like a blockchain technology but
[20:34] I could be wrong here like I I don't
[20:35] know what happens in the future in 10
[20:37] years 20 years maybe all the stocks are
[20:39] based on blockchain technology and they
[20:41] are like based on on on tokenization and
[20:44] and the stock market is basically
[20:46] changing um but that's how I look at it
[20:49] right now I don't see a value in in in
[20:52] any altcoin it's like I don't see the
[20:54] the specific use case but uh it Canen
[20:58] and we were writing about
[21:01] onei you know
[21:03] helium it's like a million
[21:06] different places around the world where
[21:08] you can get access to Wi-Fi through the
[21:10] helium protocol I mean there's a use
[21:12] case there's that file coin um which way
[21:15] you could do file sharing on other
[21:17] people's computers I mean there I mean I
[21:19] think that some of these things are
[21:21] distractive but most of it is e you know
[21:24] most most of these projectss are trying
[21:25] to compete with ethereum because because
[21:28] you know there is a proven use case if
[21:30] there's no ethereum there's no stable
[21:32] coin and you know if you listen to Larry
[21:34] think he's talking
[21:36] about the whole world you know all the
[21:39] shares and bonds ending up on u in this
[21:42] crypto architecture and I think that's
[21:43] where I am I think that this is a better
[21:46] way of doing things it's t plus zero and
[21:48] you know Bitcoin is Bitcoin has got an
[21:50] economic Austrian School not Austrian
[21:53] geography but an Austrian element to it
[21:56] and um like gold does and that's fine I
[21:59] get that and the others don't so the
[22:01] others need to be regulated and they're
[22:04] just stocks they're tech stocks and I
[22:06] think if you leave it at that they're
[22:08] not in competition with Bitcoin so much
[22:10] they're still correlated but I don't
[22:12] think they will be forever you know I'm
[22:14] pretty sure that bitcoin's a very
[22:16] different trade you know proof of stake
[22:18] is useless for a store of value you know
[22:21] you really don't want to um have a a
[22:25] profit engine like ethereum if you
[22:26] consider the fees to be profit
[22:28] it is a store of value but it but it's
[22:30] not an off-grid decentralized store of
[22:33] value but that's fine so therefore
[22:34] they've got to C the authorities
[22:36] whatever that means whereas Bitcoin
[22:38] doesn't
[22:40] need yeah exactly the alins
[22:43] need yeah did they need some kind of
[22:47] cash
[22:49] flow yeah I think you have to you have
[22:53] to you know to like Bitcoin I don't
[22:56] think you have to hate allcoins I I
[22:58] think most people realize 99% are
[23:00] worthless I mean that's just obvious but
[23:03] um but some of them there's going to be
[23:05] some interesting things that happen over
[23:06] time and it's hard to know exactly what
[23:09] those things will be and where they pop
[23:11] up but you got to have the faith and I
[23:13] think that you know I came into the
[23:15] space I don't know much about computers
[23:17] but I came into this space and just knew
[23:19] something was going to happen because I
[23:21] witnessed the entire 1990s internet
[23:24] thing and it started with email and
[23:28] sites and and it's just gone better
[23:30] every year every single year something
[23:32] better comes and people used to laugh at
[23:34] the internet stocks you they were a joke
[23:36] and the top 20 sites in 1999 were all
[23:39] porn you know so everyone was you know
[23:42] it was terrifying it's like how do you
[23:43] how how do you take the Internet
[23:45] seriously when it's just naked people
[23:47] you know and but it but it was and then
[23:50] of course porn's still big but
[23:52] everything else got bigger yeah you now
[23:54] file your taxes your medical records
[23:57] everything AI you know so the world has
[24:00] moved on and I think you you've got to
[24:02] just sort of say that if if crypto
[24:05] Bitcoin Etc was worthless it would
[24:07] already be dead it's been going too long
[24:09] I'm super excited to announce that this
[24:12] podcast just got the first ever sponsor
[24:17] I just started the podcast out like
[24:18] three months ago and now we have 21
[24:22] Bitcoin as a partner for this podcast 21
[24:26] Bitcoin is Bitcoin coin only from day
[24:29] one and they teach and preach self
[24:32] custody this is my goto exchange when
[24:36] someone asks me oh where can I buy my
[24:38] Bitcoin from this is the easiest entry
[24:41] for bitcoiners and if you want lower
[24:45] fees Plus at the same time support this
[24:48] podcast use code Robin and click the
[24:51] link in the description let's move back
[24:53] to completely only Bitcoin and gold um I
[24:56] have an interesting question for people
[24:59] uh like there are not a lot of people
[25:01] that I see in my Bitcoin bubble maybe
[25:04] they're like in the gold bubble more
[25:05] that are really Bitcoin and gold I know
[25:07] some that are just gold I know some that
[25:10] are only Bitcoin I know some that
[25:12] switched from gold to Gold only to
[25:14] bitcoin only but you are in a unique
[25:16] position where you see value and a big
[25:18] value in both I think you also probably
[25:21] have like big goals for for both um in
[25:25] what regard is gold Superior to Bitcoin
[25:28] and in what regard is like Bitcoin
[25:30] Superior to
[25:32] Gold yeah good question I mean gold
[25:35] Gold's Advantage is it doesn't require
[25:38] electricity yeah it's quite nice it's
[25:41] established in in government circles
[25:43] it's established with central banks
[25:45] bitcoin's not will it be one day maybe
[25:48] unlikely because the central banks
[25:50] already have
[25:52] gold um Gold's got a big demand in
[25:54] jewelry small demand in industry but a
[25:57] big demand in in
[25:58] jewelry and there's a very established
[26:01] ecosystem um in the gold market you the
[26:05] gold ETFs are 180
[26:07] billion there's an active Futures
[26:09] contracts in Shanghai in
[26:12] Chicago um and Dubai and places like
[26:15] that so it's a very established
[26:18] market and you know all the and there's
[26:20] plenty of value in go there you know $13
[26:22] trillion 14 trillion something like
[26:25] that in Bitcoin it's just much smaller
[26:28] Market um its advantages to think about
[26:31] the advantages rather than the
[26:32] disadvantages the advantag is obviously
[26:34] it's transp it's
[26:36] transportability you can go across a
[26:38] border with a with a billion dollars in
[26:41] your brain well you remember yeah it's
[26:44] an amazing thing and um but I think what
[26:47] do they have in common they're both
[26:48] politically neutral bitcoin's never done
[26:51] nothing wrong bad people have done bad
[26:53] things with Bitcoin bad people have done
[26:55] bad things with dollars bad people have
[26:58] done bad things with gold but Gold's
[27:00] never done anything wrong and bitcoin's
[27:01] never done anything wrong they're just
[27:03] it's one's a technology the other's an
[27:05] element and they're neutral they're
[27:07] Global Brands they're globally
[27:08] recognized both of them you know and
[27:11] it's quite interesting I had a
[27:12] photograph of a of a gold dealer in
[27:14] Turkey um where you go and buy gold
[27:17] coins and of course in turkey that's
[27:19] quite appealing where you've got high
[27:20] inflation but this gold dealer also will
[27:23] sell you uh tether or Circle US dollar
[27:26] stable coins it would also sell you
[27:28] Bitcoins so they're kind of they're kind
[27:30] of naturally together the people that
[27:32] like gold um generally like Bitcoin but
[27:36] then the people I think
[27:38] that the the big difference is there are
[27:41] lots and lots of people who think
[27:43] bitcoin's great and Gold's tired it's an
[27:45] old man yeah and there are lots of
[27:48] people who like gold and think bitcoin's
[27:50] crazy and
[27:51] risky and there are even more people
[27:54] that think both are crazy and
[27:56] unnecessary and we should just stick
[27:58] with the formal Financial system and
[28:00] you're right what you said a moment ago
[28:02] and I find myself in the middle of three
[28:04] camps so I'm not a bitcoiner I'm not a
[28:06] go person I'm not a theat guy I'm in the
[28:09] middle of all of these groups with
[28:11] absolutely no friends so um it's a very
[28:14] lonely place to be to like Bitcoin and
[28:17] gold and the traditional Financial
[28:19] system and that's where I am
[28:23] trendless yeah that that's why I
[28:25] actually like your profile because it's
[28:27] usually I only have Bitcoin as on and
[28:29] you're the first person I have on the
[28:31] podcast and it's my I think you're my
[28:33] 28th guest now that is outside of the
[28:37] Bitcoin only space like I don't even
[28:39] don't even have someone that is also
[28:41] into some altcoins that also like some
[28:44] have uh some gold some have some uh
[28:47] Equity some have some real estate next
[28:49] to it I had British hle maybe you know
[28:52] him from from Twitter on uh I think mon
[28:55] a month ago he went famously from from
[28:57] gold uh only to bitcoin only and he
[29:00] talked about his his journey and I try
[29:04] to keep uh even though it it's called
[29:07] the Bitcoin path the broadcast I want to
[29:10] make sure there are some other views
[29:12] also do it if you completely dismiss
[29:14] Bitcoin I cannot have you on the show
[29:17] it's like then then what's the point
[29:19] maybe someday I make a debate with
[29:22] someone and moderated but uh I want to
[29:25] have a different kind of views and even
[29:27] like every guest I have on I disagree
[29:30] with with it with him on some level like
[29:33] you cannot have completely agreement um
[29:36] but an interesting comparison between
[29:38] Bitcoin and gold is also that Bitcoin is
[29:40] so much smaller than gold it's not only
[29:42] the the history and and all the the
[29:44] physicality of it Bitcoin is like what
[29:47] the goal is 13x in the market
[29:49] capitalization of of of of Bitcoin like
[29:51] it's an immense difference from from the
[29:54] market capitalization do you envision
[29:56] and future in like 10 to let's see 50
[29:59] years like really far out where gold has
[30:02] the same market capitalization than than
[30:05] Bitcoin if Bitcoin is the digital
[30:07] version of of that
[30:09] gold yes and I think what happened last
[30:11] Thursday would accelerate that you the
[30:13] Bitcoin ETF is the most important thing
[30:16] in the world I would say it would never
[30:18] happen without it so the Bitcoin ETF is
[30:20] essential to fulfill that dream but I
[30:23] also think that uh the gold is 13
[30:26] trillion but that's going up as well
[30:28] right so you've got half let's call
[30:31] Bitcoin I don't know what is it three
[30:33] 750 billion something like that you want
[30:36] to take the trillion and hair cut 25%
[30:38] for lost coins is my simple idea and um
[30:43] so so you've got the gap which is quite
[30:45] big 15x something like that and and
[30:48] one's going up and the other's going up
[30:50] faster so let's say that Gold's going to
[30:53] treble and and that means bitcoin's got
[30:55] to go up 45 times to get to Equalization
[30:58] but it probably never quite equalizes
[31:00] it's probably always a little bit behind
[31:02] you can imagine it because the central
[31:03] banks you know that's the big money
[31:06] that's that's the really really big
[31:08] money and it all depends on you know how
[31:10] investors allocate to bitcoin so this
[31:13] comes back to the whole like you know
[31:15] where I really come from you know I'm
[31:16] not a Bitcoin solely a Bitcoin gold guy
[31:19] you know here at B tree we you know as I
[31:20] said we do tokens but we also most of
[31:22] our work is um is bonds and equities and
[31:26] a little bit of commodi so we are a
[31:28] multi-asset uh research organization and
[31:31] we've created a product called bold
[31:32] Bitcoin and gold um there's an ETF
[31:35] listed in Switzerland and Germany
[31:37] tickers bold and you know and it's it's
[31:40] there to solve a problem because I
[31:41] looked at Bitcoin and gold I've always
[31:42] liked gold and I said gold people
[31:45] there's $200 billion or $175 billion of
[31:48] gold in ETFs you know it's boring you
[31:50] can put a little bit of go of Bitcoin
[31:52] into that mix and and wake it up Bitcoin
[31:55] people you've got all that uh vola ility
[31:57] we can calm it down by putting a little
[31:59] bit of of gold into the mix and because
[32:02] they're naturally uncorrelated in a
[32:04] typical month Gold's up bitcoin's down
[32:06] all the other way around and you
[32:07] rebalance you're always rebalancing and
[32:09] that adds 5 to 7% per year so you've got
[32:12] this extraordinarily powerful
[32:14] combination and and now that the world's
[32:16] wealth management industry has been told
[32:19] in America it's allowed to buy Bitcoin
[32:21] the money is going to come and I'm just
[32:23] suggesting to people they'd be better
[32:25] off in Bull than they would be the
[32:27] wealth management industry not everyone
[32:29] um in B because you know if you're
[32:32] sitting there with a client and I've
[32:33] been through this sort of experience
[32:35] before and you know if you got some
[32:38] client and and and and you bought them
[32:41] Bitcoin and it goes down 75% which
[32:43] happens every third or fourth year yeah
[32:45] it's a pretty it's a pretty awful
[32:47] meeting if you you know if you put them
[32:49] in Bitcoin and gold mixed together then
[32:52] they go well that's all right that's a
[32:53] very calm outcome you know behaves like
[32:56] NE
[32:57] stock so you know you've got this thing
[33:00] that goes up nicely goes up faster than
[33:02] gold because you've got Bitcoin um but
[33:05] to the downside risk is a bit like nesle
[33:07] and so you think wow um so Bitcoin and
[33:10] gold I just think it's one of those very
[33:12] powerful combinations and then people
[33:14] say well where's your ethereum I think
[33:15] we've already answered that ethereum is
[33:18] not a pro is not an off-grid uh proof of
[33:20] Stak so we don't want that you know
[33:22] where's silver I don't want silver it's
[33:24] more volatile and it's less liquid what
[33:26] about oil I don't want oil because it's
[33:28] Futures I want real real oil but how can
[33:30] I buy real oil I can't I don't want
[33:32] Futures in my so I realize I've got the
[33:34] world's two most liquid alternative
[33:36] assets Bitcoin and gold put them
[33:38] together on risk adjusted basis and this
[33:40] is a solution for the wealth management
[33:43] industry or for private individuals you
[33:46] know not bitcoiners like you and your
[33:48] regular listeners who have all the
[33:50] wallets and understand how it all works
[33:53] I'm talking about the normal person who
[33:54] couldn't give a about any of that
[33:56] they just want some economic
[33:58] exposure yeah it's uh it's interesting
[34:02] because I have some uh older listeners
[34:05] and some older audiences members also I
[34:08] interact with them on a daily basis on
[34:10] on Twitter and for them it's usually
[34:15] harder to get into the whole wallet
[34:16] things like it's it's it's it's it's not
[34:19] as easy it's even for me it was really
[34:21] like I needed to learn a lot of things I
[34:23] I'm a software developer and I'm 25 I
[34:27] lived with all of it like for me
[34:30] software is just nature and still I
[34:33] needed to educate myself a lot with the
[34:35] wallets with cryptography everything I
[34:39] can imagine someone who is like maybe
[34:42] let's say 70 80 years old who has just
[34:46] got a little bit of computer exposure
[34:48] because their grandsons are forcing them
[34:50] to and uh they they don't need it for
[34:54] work uh they maybe retired when the
[34:57] whole computer thing came on like they
[35:00] there there's a lot of Education going
[35:03] on that's needed to do so like I have a
[35:06] a lot of respect for everybody above 50
[35:09] 60 70 who has Bitcoin in self custody
[35:12] does the key management itself and uh of
[35:15] course yes it the Bitcoin DF unlocks a
[35:17] whole lot of capital also with like the
[35:21] whole companies maybe Pension funds that
[35:23] are not even able to buy directly
[35:25] Bitcoin because they are not allowed but
[35:27] now with the Bitcoin EDF they allowed to
[35:30] um one interesting question yeah just
[35:33] finish off on that point is is that you
[35:37] know a lot of young people obviously
[35:38] they know more about tech they're more
[35:40] comfortable with tech but also they're
[35:43] not as rich I mean some are but most
[35:45] aren't and so most young people they
[35:47] bought their first crypto trade was 100
[35:49] Euros or 50 EUR and it might have gone
[35:52] up a thousand times because they were
[35:53] early I don't know but you know if you
[35:55] came in with 50 Eur you don't worry
[35:57] about software wallets in quite the same
[36:00] way as if you're a a 70- year- old
[36:02] person with a pension fund you're
[36:03] thinking well you want you to put 50
[36:05] Grand into this wallet thing I I don't
[36:07] understand you know then the bank's
[36:09] sending them warning letters and all
[36:11] this stuff it's wouldn't you rather go
[36:13] to ey shares and just say can I please
[36:15] have some Bitcoin so it's very easy to
[36:18] you know with your 50 grand um it's very
[36:20] easy to see why the ETF is so powerful
[36:23] and and you know before 2003 when the
[36:25] first gold ETF F
[36:28] launched you could not hold gold in the
[36:30] portfolio was impossible you could have
[36:33] held gold futures or gold mining shares
[36:36] um there was one Fund in Canada the
[36:38] central fund which held gold and silver
[36:40] in a Investment Trust structure but that
[36:42] was $60 million it wasn't enough to go
[36:44] around it was you know small
[36:46] thing so you've got this um the ETF
[36:51] crucially solves this problem which is a
[36:53] very important one that needs to be
[36:55] solved you know and I think think
[36:56] there's a lot of there's a lot of crap
[36:58] thinking out there you know people say
[37:00] oh well the whole point of Bitcoin is
[37:02] Independence if you want the
[37:04] independence then then do self- custody
[37:07] if you want the economic exposure do the
[37:09] ETF you know and and and so you've got
[37:12] choices and any good sophisticated
[37:14] Market gives you lots of choices you
[37:16] know with gold I could buy a gold token
[37:18] I could buy a gold bar I can buy a
[37:21] British gold coin which is taxfree in
[37:23] the UK I'm sure other countries will
[37:25] have different arrangements with them
[37:26] gold coins from their central banks I
[37:28] can buy foreign ones I can buy ancient
[37:30] ones as a collector I can buy Futures I
[37:33] can buy
[37:34] ETFs um I could buy gold bonds I can I
[37:37] can you know have gold loans backed and
[37:40] settled in gold and so you know that's a
[37:42] creative Market where youve got a lot of
[37:44] choices yeah um and I think a simple
[37:47] Market that doesn't have many choices is
[37:49] not nearly as sophisticated as one with
[37:51] many choices so you know Bitcoin in the
[37:54] crypto sphere is way more sophisticated
[37:57] than anything else in terms of the ways
[37:59] you can have Bitcoin wrapped Bitcoin um
[38:03] Bitcoin miners um you know Bitcoin
[38:06] lending you know all this kind of stuff
[38:09] so Futures you got a market of debt and
[38:13] and that's very very important and you
[38:15] can see bitcoin's going the same way
[38:16] we'll never get the um the pretty little
[38:20] physical Bitcoin things because it's not
[38:21] a physical thing it's an idea um but the
[38:26] market highly sophisticated and highly
[38:28] liquid and that's why I'm so bullish on
[38:30] bitcoin you know that I know it's
[38:34] real I mean if you want physicality in
[38:37] Bitcoin you can stamp your seed phrase
[38:39] on some some metal thing but it's not
[38:42] the actual Bitcoin it's just the words
[38:44] the information on the seat phras that's
[38:46] physical but uh there there's also in
[38:49] the early days I think I don't know if
[38:51] they still sell it um you can buy like
[38:54] Bitcoin that look like Bitcoin gold
[38:56] coins uh and in there is like a seed
[38:59] phrase where you can redeem then one
[39:00] Bitcoin they they sold them in the early
[39:03] days for like 100 EUR and it was one
[39:05] Bitcoin on them now they're like now
[39:07] they would not sell a whole Bitcoin I
[39:08] think um like to close it up the podcast
[39:12] I have two more questions the first is
[39:14] like kind of the performance You're
[39:15] Expecting for Bitcoin and gold in the
[39:18] next like coming like five 10 years like
[39:21] under five years I I know it's
[39:23] completely speculation but uh the longer
[39:26] you go out the more you can say I think
[39:29] um what do you see as as performance of
[39:31] gold and Bitcoin in the next like five
[39:34] 10 20 years I wrote an article in 2020
[39:38] in the in the lbma the lbma is the body
[39:40] for gold the London metal bu Association
[39:43] I wrote my article in their their
[39:45] magazine saying $7,000 go doll goal by
[39:48] 2030 it was called the rational case for
[39:51] $7,000 goal by 2030 so Gold's 2,000 just
[39:54] over 2,000 today so we're talking three
[39:56] and a half times um over the next six
[39:59] seven years will will we get there I
[40:02] think so it does feel right to me and
[40:04] I've laid out the case why and if you
[40:06] think that um the number one thing is
[40:10] gold is basically behaves like 20 year
[40:12] tips and so what that means is it likes
[40:16] low interest rates fine but it hasn't
[40:18] minded rates going up in the last couple
[40:20] years which is pretty interesting and
[40:22] that's because the world's divided you
[40:24] know China is no longer uh economically
[40:26] so close to us as it was before the war
[40:29] in Ukraine um and the the world's a
[40:32] crazier place and people don't trust the
[40:34] US treasuries and so gold has basically
[40:37] become less volatile than us treasuries
[40:39] and you know it's got you know all the
[40:41] obvious arguments um other people's
[40:44] government paper is not as good as a bar
[40:46] of gold anymore and so that's that's
[40:48] pretty interesting and so I think that
[40:51] uh gold will become more and more
[40:53] important in thei in the official
[40:54] Financial system um and I think that the
[40:57] $7,000 is achievable and as I was saying
[41:00] you know I think that that bitcoin's
[41:02] going to go up faster um if we bring it
[41:05] back to the money supply You could argue
[41:08] that Gold's basically being going up at
[41:10] the same Pace as the global money supply
[41:12] growth yeah which is about 7 seven and a
[41:16] half% per year on average obviously it's
[41:18] been going going um U not so well
[41:21] recently because they've been trying to
[41:23] slay around the machine but but
[41:25] basically all goes up at let's call it
[41:27] the money supply of of around 7% it
[41:30] doesn't matter who's printing the money
[41:31] it doesn't matter whether it's Europe or
[41:32] whether it's America or whether it's
[41:34] China but if someone's printing money
[41:36] then then gold Gold's happy about that
[41:39] um and the same is true for Bitcoin U
[41:41] but it probably goes up at a at a faster
[41:43] Pace harder harder to say uh what that
[41:46] pace is but I think Trend growth is
[41:48] probably still something close to
[41:50] 50% um if you if you go back over the
[41:53] years and um yeah maybe that's too
[41:57] bullish maybe that's too bullish but but
[41:59] it's something like that and I kind of
[42:01] think okay from my perspective of my B
[42:04] index yeah I'm one quarter Bitcoin I'm
[42:07] three quarters
[42:08] gold money supply is going up at 7 seven
[42:11] and a half% per year the way I like to
[42:13] think about it is I'm going to get paid
[42:14] once from the gold I'm GNA get paid once
[42:17] for the for the Bitcoin the seven and a
[42:19] half you know once for each and then
[42:21] once for the
[42:22] rebalancing yeah so go so the Bold index
[42:24] becomes a sort of 2020 5% vehicle with
[42:28] volatility of around 14% which is
[42:31] basically a major stock market index
[42:32] like the S&P 500 yeah and I bring it
[42:35] into that framework and I also thinking
[42:37] about the market cap ratio that you
[42:39] mentioned earlier we'll call it 15 to1
[42:42] um about how quickly they close you know
[42:44] one of the things about ethereum and
[42:46] Bitcoin I think the ethereum Bulls don't
[42:48] realize that if Bitcoin you if ethereum
[42:50] doubles then then it's caught up with
[42:53] Bitcoin and that's ridiculous the idea
[42:55] that ethereum's going to over to take
[42:56] Bitcoin is a to my mind a pretty
[42:58] ridiculous idea so therefore why be so
[43:01] bullish on ethereum I'd rather be
[43:02] bullish on something trying to compete
[43:04] with ethereum like salana or something
[43:06] like that because at least it has a
[43:08] chance to go up whereas ethereum I don't
[43:10] see how it can outperform Bitcoin you
[43:11] may as well just own Bitcoin um so yeah
[43:14] basically the bottom line is bitcoin's
[43:16] going up faster than gold um at what
[43:19] pace don't know very good question I'm
[43:21] going to go and look at that for my next
[43:23] piece um and and see see if we can do
[43:27] some Trend some Trend Bitcoin versus
[43:30] gold stuff and see where see where that
[43:32] takes us but I would think that
[43:34] bitcoin's probably going up at a at a 5x
[43:36] pace something like that yeah also be
[43:40] because you mentioned ethereum uh
[43:42] there's an interesting thing when you
[43:43] look at the starting point when ethereum
[43:46] switched from proof of work to proof of
[43:48] stake since then uh ethereum measured
[43:52] against Bitcoin is simply going down
[43:54] like it's since like over one year now
[43:57] and the dominant ratio between Bitcoin
[44:00] and ethereum is completely going down
[44:02] since they switched to proof of
[44:04] stake um Rob before you say that it's
[44:07] been going down since January
[44:09] 2018 when they launched the Futures
[44:11] Contract ether's been lagging Bitcoin
[44:13] for a long
[44:15] time oh I did not know that I only track
[44:17] it from the moment they switched to
[44:20] protocol because this is like a big big
[44:23] switch for me because they completely
[44:24] gone uh whole different route then and
[44:27] from that moment onwards it's completely
[44:29] clear that it's not even uh even uh
[44:32] slight competitive with it uh but yeah
[44:35] it's senary 2018 interesting
[44:39] um one last question before we go into
[44:42] the end routine uh what has to happen or
[44:46] can something happen for you to go all
[44:49] in in Bitcoin like what do you have to
[44:52] see to to go completely in Bitcoin like
[44:56] is there something that can happen that
[44:58] is like oh now I have to take
[45:01] Bitcoin in like 95% of my portfolio
[45:05] 99% so the way the Bold index works is I
[45:08] don't decide anything yeah it's an index
[45:11] that's calculated by Vinter in Stockholm
[45:13] and they pass the the information to our
[45:15] ETF 21 shares in Zurich in Switzerland
[45:18] and that happens at the end of each
[45:19] month they rebalance it that process is
[45:22] based on the volatility of each asset so
[45:25] if wanted me to be 5% gold 95% Bitcoin
[45:29] bitcoin's got to have um low volatility
[45:32] which is possible so let's say it's 38
[45:34] today and it comes down to 20 or 18 like
[45:37] gold is today but something goes wrong
[45:39] with gold and gold volatility spikes to
[45:43] 300% so if gold volatility went crazy
[45:46] why would that happen um could happen
[45:48] because a meteorite landed with you know
[45:51] the the supply of gold goes up 10x
[45:54] 100x um or why why else would the price
[45:58] why why else will gold uh go up
[46:02] maybe I don't know I think that you'd
[46:04] have to see a vast increase in the gold
[46:06] Supply something like that something
[46:09] dramatic all all the central banks going
[46:12] you know we don't like gold anymore
[46:14] we're going to go with Bitcoin we're
[46:15] coming Bitcoin yeah so something like
[46:18] that I don't think this is a really
[46:20] scenario I think it's a very unlikely
[46:22] scenario but but I think that is the
[46:24] sort of thing that would see the the vol
[46:26] ility of Gold Spike and the volatility
[46:28] of go of Bitcoin come down and then the
[46:30] Bold index would then have more Bitcoin
[46:33] than gold yeah so for example when the
[46:36] FED comes out oh we're selling all our
[46:38] gold and buying Bitcoin with it that
[46:41] would be
[46:42] crazy that would meet your scenario yeah
[46:45] absolutely say well our bold index is
[46:47] now overweight Bitcoin yeah um in our
[46:51] end routine we have uh an routine where
[46:55] the previous guest asks the question for
[46:57] the next guest without knowing who's the
[46:58] next guest is and uh the question for
[47:01] you is what was your funniest or
[47:03] craziest moment in educating someone in
[47:07] Bitcoin um I think it's this idea um I'm
[47:11] sorry I haven't got a really funny story
[47:12] at this point but but I think it's this
[47:15] idea that that people think that
[47:18] Bitcoins have a serial number on
[47:21] them they me their mental model like I
[47:23] did in 2012 yeah when I was educated
[47:26] myself I thought you could cut and paste
[47:28] it like you could photocopy a € 10 note
[47:30] yeah I thought you got Bitcoin get the
[47:32] code cut it past it two Bitcoins and it
[47:35] wasn't until I understood the Providence
[47:37] of the blockchain that I realized that
[47:38] was wrong and I think most people have a
[47:41] mental
[47:42] model that has a coin with a serial
[47:45] number on
[47:46] it and that's
[47:48] wrong you know it's more like your
[47:50] family tree you your DNA Bitcoin is DNA
[47:54] and your DNA is is a function of your
[47:56] parents and
[47:57] grandparents and Bitcoin is made like
[48:00] that so there is no serial number but it
[48:02] does have a DNA which is which is
[48:05] related to where it came from and um and
[48:08] I think that's that that that is the
[48:10] point and once that penny is dropped
[48:12] once you understand that then I think
[48:14] most people start to get their heads
[48:15] around that this this whole idea of
[48:18] Providence
[48:20] well and that's pretty that's that's
[48:22] that's pretty powerful I
[48:24] think uh a fun a funny story on
[48:27] educating I'll tell you what's funny the
[48:30] fact is that 99% of the world even after
[48:32] 10 years since satachi Nakamoto was
[48:34] chased around Los Angeles on a motorbike
[48:37] 99% of people in trafi have no idea and
[48:41] and and read the same things it's it's
[48:43] blockchain not
[48:44] Bitcoin you know what I
[48:46] mean I still think that's true after 10
[48:50] years blockchain not Bitcoin I always
[48:53] say the difference it's it's Bitcoin not
[48:54] blockchain
[48:56] um um where can people find you the best
[49:00] where can people get in touch with you
[49:02] uh B tree.com
[49:04] so on Twitter I'm at Atlas PSE Atlas as
[49:08] in map and pulse as in pulse and then
[49:12] bite tree um it's inverted is that
[49:14] inverted to you does that does that come
[49:17] out does that say B tree or yeah it says
[49:19] bite
[49:20] tree BTE bits and bites so this is a
[49:23] money tree you know it's the idea of
[49:26] growing a tree out of money so that's
[49:27] why we called the company bite tree to
[49:29] cover crypto oh cool thank you for being
[49:33] on Robin thank you very
[49:35] [Music]
[49:39] much
