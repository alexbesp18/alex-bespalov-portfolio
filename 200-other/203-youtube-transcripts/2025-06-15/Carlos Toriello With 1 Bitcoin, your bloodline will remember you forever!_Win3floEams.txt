[00:00] if you have even one Bitcoin to pass on
[00:03] to your children and grandchildren they
[00:05] will remember you forever I was
[00:08] attempting to prove election fraud if
[00:10] people realized wow our system could
[00:12] have collapsed but Bitcoin was there to
[00:14] protect us Bitcoin becomes an anchor of
[00:16] Truth in a sea of Lies every single
[00:20] piece of data that a government
[00:22] publishes you should have a time stamp
[00:24] to prove that that document can never be
[00:25] manipulated to eliminate the ability of
[00:28] the state to erase history and full
[00:31] Humanity I think that's worth paying to
[00:34] audit the entirety of Guatemalan voting
[00:37] system using Bitcoin part of that story
[00:39] is getting Bitcoin to become the
[00:41] timestamp know standard for all data
[00:44] [Music]
[00:47] everywhere what are you doing how did
[00:49] you come to where you are and how did
[00:52] you come to uh what you do with
[00:53] elections with Guatemala with
[00:56] Bitcoin it's a long story uh but the
[00:58] short of it is I am Carlos too I am
[01:01] known as carinho uh for those that are
[01:05] good at Spanish or or Portuguese h i
[01:09] born and raised in Guatemala uh for
[01:11] those that don't know it's uh in between
[01:13] Mexico and El Salvador uh so Central
[01:17] America and uh born and raised here went
[01:20] to school in the states then came back
[01:22] in 2009 you know great time to to
[01:24] graduate from from college 2009 and um
[01:29] immediately
[01:30] I tried to you know get involved in in
[01:33] in uh different businesses here my my
[01:35] father was an entrepreneur I I joined
[01:37] his the family business and um
[01:40] specifically with elections uh Guatemala
[01:42] has a volunteer army that manages the
[01:46] elections and so we have uh voting every
[01:49] four years and I decided to join that in
[01:52] 2011 2015 then I came back as an
[01:56] election Auditor in
[01:58] 2019 to don't trust verify the results
[02:02] and 2019 in Guatemala was the first time
[02:04] in over 30 40 years that Guatemala had
[02:08] um allegations credible allegations of
[02:12] election fraud and so I tried to audit
[02:15] the election in 2019 but I failed and so
[02:19] I just lowered my time preference and
[02:20] came back in
[02:22] 2023 and uh I very proud to say that the
[02:25] effort that I lead is the first election
[02:27] auditor to audit the entirety of
[02:31] Guatemalan voting system using Bitcoin
[02:34] and uh as a byproduct of what we did the
[02:37] company that I now work for simple proof
[02:40] is the first company in the world to
[02:42] have gotten a nation state to use
[02:45] Bitcoin to protect its voting system
[02:47] that's a fascinating story um let's
[02:50] start with uh the basics why should we
[02:53] use Bitcoin to uh prove uh elections and
[02:58] and audit elections
[03:00] so personally and I emphasize I am not
[03:04] here to convince you to believe in
[03:06] democracy if you have lost faith in it
[03:09] that is
[03:11] your experience your uh you know that's
[03:14] fine like I'm not here to convince you
[03:17] about democracy as a bitcoiner though
[03:20] what I believe is that voting systems
[03:23] which democracies should have are
[03:26] effectively proof of work consensus
[03:29] algorithms
[03:30] and in the case of Guatemala because
[03:32] it's all paper based I believe they are
[03:35] um proof of work consensus algorithms uh
[03:39] with an audit trail that is in the
[03:41] analog world and in specifically in the
[03:44] case of Guama the system is very similar
[03:47] and has many similarities to how Bitcoin
[03:51] works and so I believe that voting
[03:54] systems and that's what I found in
[03:56] Guatemala provide bitcoiners an
[03:58] opportunity to reach a new audience not
[04:03] with a money argument but rather with
[04:06] truth and in a posttruth world that we
[04:10] live in nowadays it's um very important
[04:13] to or at least that argument is uh
[04:17] material to a lot of people and actually
[04:20] might be easier for them to be
[04:22] interested in Bitcoin um and instead of
[04:25] going straight to to the money right
[04:27] like I think it's natural and probably
[04:29] very good and healthy for people to
[04:31] naturally reject uh you know these
[04:34] Psychopaths on the internet talking
[04:36] about their money being broken um you
[04:38] know that's it's a natural response but
[04:40] in the case of uh the voting system
[04:43] there is this consensus algorithm that
[04:45] takes place and Bitcoin and its
[04:48] immutability characteristics its
[04:51] decentralization uh can really help um
[04:54] specifically in the case for me it was
[04:56] in 2019 when I was attempting to to
[04:59] prove election fraud you know I have
[05:02] friends who are lawyers told me if you
[05:04] find evidence of election fraud in the
[05:07] 2019 election and you prove it all that
[05:11] is going to happen is that the
[05:12] government will accuse you of election
[05:15] tampering and in Guatemala at least that
[05:18] is treason and so I was looking at
[05:21] potentially going to jail for treason
[05:23] which hasn't happened in Guatemala in
[05:25] hundreds of years um and so I needed a
[05:28] way to demon demate that the data that I
[05:32] had was the exact same data that the
[05:34] government published and so uh I
[05:38] discovered open timestamps which is a
[05:41] protocol that was built in 2016
[05:44] 2017 that is a very simple protocol and
[05:47] and and application that lends anyone
[05:50] really individuals or anyone the ability
[05:53] to use Bitcoin as a timestamping service
[05:56] which uh I'll pause there it's
[05:57] interesting for me U um like you said
[06:00] before 2019 you failed uh how did you
[06:04] fail in in like everything went wrong in
[06:06] 2019 but the the summary is uh I was
[06:10] trying to do something very very hard um
[06:13] in response to the voting system
[06:16] collapsing and so if you are concerned
[06:19] that uh if you care about this this and
[06:22] I cared a lot and care a lot about my
[06:24] voting system um and you're concerned
[06:27] that there might be election fraud like
[06:29] someone May attack your voting system uh
[06:31] and you want to protect it then uh you
[06:34] shouldn't wait until election night um
[06:37] and I you know had my concerns and and
[06:40] this and that but I wasn't really
[06:41] prepared for the collapse of our voting
[06:44] system it's like we have this website
[06:47] that is public where uh people can look
[06:50] at uh the data and on Election night
[06:53] that's what the media uses and it just
[06:55] collapsed so you have people on TV you
[06:57] know the TV people oh and so
[07:00] Robin is is oh I we don't see the data
[07:03] anymore oh now Carlos is oh the data is
[07:06] gone oh Robin is not oh like so it like
[07:10] everything went wrong right and so um
[07:13] after the like when that happened I
[07:14] wasn't prepared for that level of of of
[07:16] chaos uh and so in 2023 when I succeeded
[07:21] was you know I lowered my time
[07:22] preference and I I thought and prepared
[07:25] and researched Bitcoin I studied Bitcoin
[07:27] and found many useful things in Bitcoin
[07:30] uh and was just ready so instead of
[07:32] reacting to the madness I prepared and I
[07:36] had the tools ready to go to actually
[07:38] pull it off if that makes sense it it
[07:41] makes sense um how do usual W things
[07:46] work like without Bitcoin in Guatemala
[07:48] how do they usually like in Austria the
[07:51] only thing that I know is like I go in
[07:53] there I make my thing and I write a name
[07:57] and then I put it in a boxy Prett simple
[08:00] like wooden box I think it is that's the
[08:02] only thing I know like what's the the
[08:04] process from there sure so when I
[08:06] mentioned that what Amala has this
[08:08] volunteer army it's you know who is the
[08:11] the person that gives you the ballot
[08:13] right um that's what I was in 2011 2015
[08:18] it's the great victory of our last
[08:20] Revolution in Guatemala in 1982 uh
[08:23] basically Guatemala between 1950 to 1980
[08:27] uh the votes were you know you show up
[08:29] and there a military Guy saying you know
[08:30] here's your boat you know so that's
[08:34] democracy um uh but in as of 1982 in our
[08:38] last Revolution we took that power away
[08:40] from the government and created this
[08:42] beautiful system where uh neighbors are
[08:45] the ones that are in charge of this so
[08:47] you can volunteer to be the person at
[08:50] the box right we call them voting tables
[08:53] and so you show up very early in the
[08:55] morning you have this box that contains
[08:57] all the ballots you have friends to help
[09:00] you you know prepare it and you have a a
[09:03] a voting role right a list of citizens
[09:06] that are assigned to your table and it's
[09:09] on average 400 and so this group of of
[09:12] volunteers manages this system and um
[09:16] the political parties who want to
[09:19] compete in the election can all send
[09:22] witnesses to every single one of these
[09:24] tables so as you're doing this and you
[09:27] know when Robin shows up and I give you
[09:29] your ballot you go over there you
[09:31] scratch it and then you come back and
[09:32] you deposit yourself I with my friends
[09:35] we are uh organizing this on behalf of
[09:39] uh the 400 citizens like we are
[09:41] literally we turn the volunteers turn
[09:43] into custodians right uh and in some
[09:46] ways I consider them like coin join
[09:49] coordinators right because they handle
[09:52] all the individual votes the
[09:54] transactions and then at the end of the
[09:56] day they dump out the votes and they
[09:58] visually confirm each vote saying oh
[10:00] this one's for Robin this one's for
[10:02] Carlos this one's for Robin Etc and the
[10:05] political parties are standing right
[10:07] behind them the entire time and so all
[10:10] that the political parties need to do is
[10:12] send witnesses that turns them into
[10:15] validating nodes uh in my you know to to
[10:19] use Bitcoin terms right it's the the
[10:21] volunteers are kind of like mining nodes
[10:23] or or coinjoin coordinators and then the
[10:25] political parties have a the ability to
[10:28] send these Witnesses the validating
[10:30] notes so that when the voting you know
[10:32] is counted then they actually issue a
[10:35] document that is handwritten and
[10:38] contains all the totals of that table
[10:40] and everyone present has to sign and so
[10:44] it ends up being that you know Guatemala
[10:46] had 9.2 million registered voters in
[10:50] 2023 last year or last election 400
[10:53] people to a a table that's around
[10:57] 25,000 of these tables
[10:59] and so you have a simultaneous like uh
[11:03] voting system that's happening in 25,000
[11:06] different places with you know four to
[11:09] five people at each table uh as the
[11:12] mining nodes or coin joint coordinators
[11:14] that's 100,000 people and then the
[11:17] Witnesses are again like four or five
[11:19] people so it's like another 100,000
[11:22] people the estimates are 300,000 people
[11:26] and so uh in 202 3 we had 4.2 million
[11:31] people actually bothered to vote so it's
[11:34] incredible in that Guatemala has about
[11:37] one in every 21 votes is overseen by uh
[11:42] people that were there and who also vote
[11:46] there right so it's this um very
[11:49] restricted secure system with hundreds
[11:52] of thousands of eyeballs watching
[11:54] everything that happens and it produces
[11:57] this document called uh well the vote
[11:59] tally sheet or the poll tape we call it
[12:03] ACTA num and that is at the heart and
[12:06] soul of our democracy so if every one of
[12:09] the tables it's about 25,000 right per
[12:13] election produces one document so there
[12:15] are
[12:16] 25,000 documents at every election but
[12:20] inside each document are 400 votes um I
[12:24] actually should probably just show you
[12:25] an example because it's easier to
[12:27] actually see it but the point there is
[12:30] these documents contain the transactions
[12:32] the votes of about 400 citizens so
[12:34] that's why they're kind of like a coin
[12:36] join the state makes that document
[12:39] public um but it protects individuals
[12:42] privacy and and their secret vote by
[12:45] mixing the vote between other citizens
[12:48] however having the witnesses there to
[12:51] fight for the ballots at that moment and
[12:53] so the only legal opportunity that
[12:56] anyone has to fight for the votes is
[12:59] there and once the day ends that's it
[13:03] right like there is no more you know
[13:05] discussion really I mean there's yeah
[13:08] it's it gets a little bit more
[13:09] complicated than that but it that means
[13:11] that you use a giant proof of work
[13:14] consensus algorithm to make sure that
[13:16] you have the totals um does that make
[13:18] sense absolutely I mean AUST I don't
[13:21] know if you know it but uh we had four
[13:24] or five years ago an a repetition of an
[13:27] election because there was something
[13:30] wrong there was uh there were like two
[13:32] three things going WR but the main thing
[13:34] was like the ballots were not sticking
[13:37] nice and so of like they opening uh and
[13:40] and the the clue was like for something
[13:43] that was not standard like they did some
[13:45] mistake with the clue of like half the
[13:47] Ballance or something I don't know
[13:48] exactly what happened but there was some
[13:50] mistake happening and it was actually
[13:53] repeated well elections are can always
[13:56] become a show that's why you
[13:58] understand that consensus right reaching
[14:00] consensus having a consensus algorithm
[14:03] at scale is very hard like getting lots
[14:07] and lots of people to agree on something
[14:10] is very hard which is why I say you know
[14:13] I'm not here to convince you about
[14:15] democracy what I'm saying is voting
[14:17] systems present bitcoiners an
[14:19] opportunity to reach a new audience that
[14:22] cares very much about these you know
[14:25] systems and if we can help them and
[14:28] improve those systems it opens a new
[14:31] touch point for people to bitcoin where
[14:34] if they really you know expose you
[14:36] exposed to it to them and they might be
[14:39] obsessed with how the voting happens and
[14:40] it's like oh it's so complicated and
[14:42] you're like yes but you know here's this
[14:44] consensus algorithm called Bitcoin that
[14:46] achieves you know consensus every 10
[14:49] minutes and you can audit the entire
[14:50] thing all the way back to the first
[14:53] block and so it's let's use voting
[14:56] systems to reach a new audience that
[14:59] might not come for money but rather for
[15:02] democracy so I think that there's the
[15:04] opportunity to reach a new generation of
[15:06] bitcoiners that came for democracy but
[15:10] will stay for
[15:11] Bitcoin yeah I heard you're saying in
[15:14] some podcast uh elections put the clown
[15:16] world into hyper Drive something like
[15:19] that yes for sure any mistake like the
[15:22] one you mentioned we had a huge one in
[15:24] 2023 that I can go into de detail about
[15:27] aom's Razer says the most simple
[15:29] explanation is more often the right one
[15:32] and Elon Musk I think famously said the
[15:35] most entertaining explanation is more
[15:37] often the right one so like what you
[15:39] said of like you have to repeat the
[15:41] whole voting thing because someone
[15:42] didn't put the glue on like or something
[15:45] it's just like and this could throw
[15:47] Society into chaos right like when you
[15:49] realize so much is at stake that one
[15:52] mistake can just destroy Society uh
[15:57] that's why we need to bring cryptography
[16:00] like Bitcoin to these systems to you
[16:03] know fortify them and if people realize
[16:06] wow our system could have collapsed but
[16:09] Bitcoin was there to protect us then
[16:12] people are are now can can be exposed to
[16:15] bitcoin be like ah I want to know more
[16:16] about this right and that's literally
[16:18] what happened in Guatemala and um you
[16:20] know I can I can share my screen if you
[16:21] want to clarify a little bit more of
[16:23] this yeah yeah let's get into it like we
[16:25] have now like cover like what the
[16:27] elections in general how work and and
[16:29] how you you describe it in Guatemala how
[16:31] this works with like the the elections
[16:33] taable and stuff like that how does
[16:35] Bitcoin now come into this um scene sure
[16:39] so first of all um you're looking at
[16:41] open timestamps um this is the
[16:44] underlying protocol so on top of Bitcoin
[16:47] there is uh Bitcoin is open source but
[16:50] open timestamps is also open source so
[16:52] find it at open Tim stamps.org and
[16:56] there's you know there's a bunch of uh
[16:59] all the code repositories Etc is there
[17:00] but really the cool thing to understand
[17:02] is this has been around since 2016
[17:06] 2017 and it's kind of like I say it is
[17:09] the last time in back then when we had
[17:11] this fight between the money maximalist
[17:14] and the database people in Bitcoin open
[17:16] timestamps is the Compromise of some a
[17:20] tool that you know no one is against
[17:22] open time stamps it's almost I joke that
[17:25] bitcoiners have um consensus that you
[17:29] know 21 million hard cap like we we will
[17:31] never change that and open time stamps
[17:34] like it I I I I've yet to meet a single
[17:36] bitcoiner that is against open timestamp
[17:38] so I encourage you to to look at it and
[17:41] what you're seeing now on your screen is
[17:43] basically this Tim stamp uh system where
[17:46] you can just drag drop any file and now
[17:50] I can click this button
[17:53] and where is
[17:56] it there we go it should prompt me to
[17:59] see that you might getting a a download
[18:01] it's not coming up on the screen but
[18:03] basically uh I can download the proof so
[18:07] all that this is is the user keeps the
[18:09] jpeg keeps the audio file whatever file
[18:12] you want to stamp you keep it on your
[18:14] drive then you download from open
[18:16] timestamps the proof that goes with that
[18:18] file and so now you have cryptographic
[18:22] proof that that file exists on bitcoin
[18:24] this is very easy to drag and drop and
[18:25] use as an individual but uh just like
[18:29] Bitcoin it's hard to have institutions
[18:31] use this right so now what I'm showing
[18:34] you is the Guatemalan voting system
[18:36] website you can do this uh on your own
[18:39] it's uh the website is
[18:42] t. GT t. GT and you basically are
[18:47] presented with this window you can click
[18:49] between any of the two major voting days
[18:51] that we had and now what you're looking
[18:54] at is you know the different elections
[18:56] we had I'm going to select the
[18:57] presidential election
[18:59] and then if I move over here it's
[19:01] starting to say oh see the system is
[19:03] displaying
[19:05] 99.28%
[19:07] great and then I can go down and see oh
[19:10] this is the national map of Guatemala so
[19:12] if you've never seen it here it is it's
[19:14] right again next door to Mexico and El
[19:16] Salvador um and then further down you
[19:19] start to see all right these are all the
[19:21] votes that on the national level were
[19:24] assigned to these uh political parties
[19:27] and there's you know a bunch of them in
[19:29] Guatemala we have the opposite of not
[19:32] enough choices we have way too many
[19:35] clowns in this clown world right look at
[19:37] all those guys right it's it just keeps
[19:40] going but the point is you know cool
[19:42] database right wow uh don't trust verify
[19:46] how do I know that these numbers on the
[19:48] screen and it's like 100 you there's one
[19:50] number says 41,000 87,000 40,000 like
[19:54] how do I know that these numbers aren't
[19:57] you know just numbers on a screen that a
[19:59] super admin user can do whatever they
[20:01] want and so interestingly I can go to
[20:04] this text box here and I can input any
[20:07] number between 1 and
[20:09] 24,500 that's the total number of tables
[20:11] so what's your favorite number Robin
[20:13] between 1 and
[20:15] 24,000 uh 420
[20:18] 420 so if I click 420 and click now I am
[20:24] now Drilling in instead of looking at
[20:26] the national scale I'm looking at table
[20:28] number 420 at voting Center 33 in this
[20:32] District uh inside the country right and
[20:35] so again the system now is showing all
[20:38] the clowns that are competing in the
[20:39] clown world so we have green party gets
[20:42] nine blue party got one yellow party got
[20:45] 10 but again don't trust verify how do I
[20:48] know these numbers aren't you know
[20:49] created by some super admin uh instead
[20:52] of like the actual votes that the
[20:54] process that we described um so if you
[20:58] scroll scroll down there was a blue
[20:59] button that said there and so now I can
[21:02] actually pull up the picture file that's
[21:04] associated to table number 420 and so
[21:08] this is handwritten document from that
[21:11] table that you can see was uh you know
[21:13] table number 420 and it's you know
[21:16] signed by Jorge Ingrid and I think it
[21:19] says Jessica but you know it's kind of
[21:21] hard to see and there saying
[21:23] 2117 citizens showed up to vote and
[21:26] their 217 votes were split in the
[21:29] following way and so these are all
[21:31] handwritten numbers uh from that
[21:34] physical paper that is the paper trail
[21:36] right um and so all of the numbers are
[21:39] further down and then on the right hand
[21:41] side you see the signatures right so
[21:43] these three people up here this is their
[21:46] signatures they are kind of the mining
[21:47] nodes or the coin join uh coordinators
[21:51] and then under them you can see 1 2 3 4
[21:55] five six seven political iCal party
[21:59] Witnesses signed this document right and
[22:02] so 2117 votes were overseen by 10 people
[22:08] with competing interests so that paper
[22:12] document is has Integrity right like
[22:16] it's it's people wouldn't sign like
[22:18] there's the the fact that this happened
[22:20] means that the numbers are the numbers
[22:22] right and
[22:23] so the tricky bit is we are looking at
[22:26] this on you know J J July 2024 and this
[22:30] happened in June 2023 how do we know
[22:33] that this JPEG file is actually a photo
[22:37] of the document that was produced in
[22:41] June
[22:42] 2023 right like that is the main like if
[22:46] I want to don't trust verify this
[22:47] database that if if if I can't know that
[22:51] then I like who cares if I can you know
[22:54] verify this like if they can change the
[22:56] photographs then it's nonsense right
[22:59] the the the system is great on paper in
[23:01] the analog world it's when it jumps into
[23:04] the digital world that things can get
[23:07] wacky right because how do you trust it
[23:09] and so we actually produced a short
[23:11] documentary it's 15 minutes long called
[23:14] immutable democracy that tells this
[23:16] story uh if you're interested in
[23:18] learning more um you can find it on
[23:20] YouTube uh for free it's immutable
[23:22] democracy 15 minutes and also on film.
[23:27] simple proof.com
[23:28] but um to keep going with the
[23:30] explanation um you see there's this
[23:32] orange button here that says verify hash
[23:36] and so everything I've shown you up
[23:37] until now is the national election
[23:39] authorities website that the media uses
[23:42] to publish the results but because of
[23:46] the chaos and Madness of 2019 when there
[23:49] were election fraud accusations they
[23:51] added this orange button and that is
[23:53] what takes you to simple proof.com
[23:56] specifically the immutable backup
[23:59] service so what you're seeing on your
[24:01] screen now is a
[24:03] timestamp from simple proof saying that
[24:06] this document was received the 26th of
[24:09] June of 2023 at 12:16 a.m. Time Zone GMT
[24:15] minus
[24:17] 6
[24:19] sorry um so this is the time zone of
[24:22] Guatemala and it's saying the database
[24:24] of this separate contractor that handled
[24:27] this data is saying that this document
[24:30] is from that moment but how do we prove
[24:32] this information well that's where open
[24:35] time stamps comes into play and
[24:37] specifically we're publishing along with
[24:39] the timestamp the Sha 256 which um do
[24:43] you want to do a little bit explainer on
[24:44] what a sh yeah yeah I think it's uh it's
[24:47] good because uh I think in every
[24:49] conversation every Bitcoin conversation
[24:51] there's always someone in there that's
[24:53] that's a little bit newer to the game or
[24:56] even like people that are longterm in
[24:57] Bitcoin maybe didn't never bothered to
[24:59] um get get into this topic so basically
[25:03] a sh 256 is a type of hash a hash
[25:06] function is essentially a way to
[25:09] summarize Digital Data into a string of
[25:12] characters and specifically sha256 uses
[25:16] so many alpha numeric characters that
[25:18] this string that you are seeing on your
[25:20] screen it's that starts with e f a 8bb
[25:25] and you know a lot of other characters
[25:27] is essentially a a very large number
[25:30] it's it's a number that is so large that
[25:32] there are more shatu 56 U than there are
[25:36] atoms in the universe so what we are
[25:39] saying is this sh 256 of this jpeg is
[25:43] extremely unique like there's nothing in
[25:45] the universe that has this
[25:48] same fingerprint this genetic code so
[25:52] what we described it to guatemal and the
[25:54] media is think of this as the
[25:57] fingerprint of
[25:58] the jpeg file right if a if a if a if a
[26:02] picture file if any Digital Data could
[26:04] be thought of as like a human body the
[26:06] shot 256 is like a fingerprint and so we
[26:09] take the fingerprint we publish it and
[26:11] then we are saying this fingerprint has
[26:13] a proof on block number
[26:17] 795,000
[26:19] um and it's on that blockchain and it's
[26:22] a very orange you know blockchain uh so
[26:25] I wonder which one it is and so then
[26:27] further down you have the date and and
[26:29] you know the time stamp of that block
[26:32] which is uh June 26 at 12:42 a.m. GMT
[26:37] minus 6 so what simple proof is doing
[26:39] here is that you are very publicly
[26:41] saying this uh you know contractor that
[26:44] has this database is saying I got it at
[26:47] 1216 and then by 12:42 so what like six
[26:52] no it's uh 26 minutes later it is the
[26:56] proof is on the uh Bitcoin uh time chain
[27:00] and
[27:01] so
[27:02] the the
[27:04] file with this hash can be proven as of
[27:08] that moment and there was only 26 minute
[27:11] window uh that it hadn't been you know
[27:14] available to the public and so some
[27:16] people would say wow but 26 minutes for
[27:18] a JPEG that's a long time you can change
[27:20] it and yes you know it's not impossible
[27:22] this doesn't completely fix all possible
[27:25] you know election fraud attacks but 2019
[27:30] these files that were published were
[27:32] published 6 days after the election so
[27:37] in this example 26 minutes yes it's you
[27:39] know it's valuable time it's a golden
[27:42] period where someone could attack this
[27:44] but 26 minutes is 99% 99.9% less time
[27:50] than six days so it's when you use this
[27:54] you eliminate
[27:56] 99% of the attack surface in force would
[27:59] be attackers to to if they want to
[28:01] attack the the voting system they have
[28:02] to do it on Election night as the
[28:05] documents are coming in when you do that
[28:07] you force people to make mistakes right
[28:10] but again you know on what you're seeing
[28:12] on your screen further down is the
[28:14] original source file so you can download
[28:16] the jpeg or you can bring it up visually
[28:19] and so see now I'm looking at know the
[28:22] document of table number 420 uh written
[28:25] by Luiz ingred and Jessica and I can
[28:27] switch back and check Vis visually
[28:30] against the other ones so these are two
[28:32] separate contractors providing the same
[28:34] information so there's redundancy here
[28:37] but you know visual comparisons are
[28:39] going to take a long time easier would
[28:41] be to just download this JPEG and you
[28:44] know check the Sha 256 because it's
[28:47] Unique to this jpeg so if the Sha 256 is
[28:50] the same you know for a fact that not a
[28:52] single Pixel of the jpeg has been
[28:55] changed and then the next bit is the
[28:58] proof so again what I was showing you
[29:00] from the open timestamps uh protocol all
[29:03] you need is to keep a copy of the
[29:05] original Source the JPEG and the proof
[29:09] and so this proof is called an OTS file
[29:12] which if I click view um and and I look
[29:15] into the file what is showing me is the
[29:18] mathematical cryptographic proofs that
[29:20] show that this shat 256 is uh included
[29:25] in a series of other hash functions um
[29:28] and cryptographic proofs and so all of
[29:30] this is basically the mathematics that I
[29:33] can use to prove that this file was
[29:36] actually included on Bitcoin now this is
[29:40] a bit tricky to interpret because it's
[29:42] all text based and you have to no you
[29:44] know cryptography to do this so what we
[29:47] built is this thing called the OTS
[29:48] Navigator so a button that says view
[29:50] Merkel tree takes you now to a graphic
[29:54] representation of what we were looking
[29:56] at and so basically on your screen what
[29:58] you're seeing is a Merkel root so
[30:01] imagine a a series of hashes strung
[30:05] together and that Merkle root is tied
[30:08] all the way down through many many
[30:11] cryptographic functions to our actual
[30:14] hash of the jpeg so this hash again it's
[30:18] like the genetic code of the jpeg EF a a
[30:23] BB right that's how it starts um let me
[30:26] go back and see the the hash it says EFA
[30:29] APB right so it's the same we're looking
[30:31] at the same hash and Visually this hash
[30:35] is tied up into a mother hash which is
[30:39] that product of combining two hashes
[30:43] together to form a new hash and so it's
[30:46] you do this and it's called a Merkel
[30:47] tree you keep going up combining it to
[30:50] another hash and another hash and so
[30:53] visually what you're seeing is the path
[30:55] that you would need to to follow all all
[30:58] the cryptographic proofs to go all the
[31:00] way up to this Merkel route the
[31:04] difference between a Merkel route and
[31:06] the rest of the tree is that yes there's
[31:09] this hash which starts with 6C
[31:13] c6b but the Merkel root also contains a
[31:17] transaction ID and so if you run your
[31:20] own Bitcoin node all you need to do is
[31:23] input that transaction ID into your node
[31:26] and you will be able to prove that this
[31:28] information exists on bitcoin we provide
[31:31] an easy link to mempool dospace a block
[31:34] explorer that I recommend everyone check
[31:36] out and as you can see now on your
[31:38] screen we're looking at block number 795
[31:42] 967 uh and the time stamp is
[31:46] 2023 uh June uh 26 at 42 in the a.m.
[31:52] which again going back to our uh time
[31:54] stamp from what we had here it's the
[31:57] same time stamp it's the same block but
[32:00] we are not looking at the Block we're
[32:02] looking at the transaction and so
[32:04] further down I can bring up the details
[32:07] of the transaction and reveal what's
[32:09] known as the op return function for
[32:13] those that don't know when you run a
[32:15] node on bitcoin you can use the op
[32:18] return function to include a short
[32:21] amount of a tiny piece of data of
[32:23] arbitrary data and so what we've
[32:25] included in this transaction in the
[32:27] opper function is that hash and so
[32:30] you're looking at
[32:31] 600 C6 which
[32:35] is the hash here and so that is why we
[32:39] are essentially using Bitcoin as a
[32:43] timestamping independent you know
[32:45] digital notary that proves
[32:48] mathematically and cryptographically
[32:51] that those pictures that were taken and
[32:53] that we looked at as the don't trust
[32:56] verify evidence of the voting
[32:58] results they they they were created at
[33:02] least on Election night therefore you
[33:06] can trust that the jpeg that you're
[33:08] looking at hasn't been altered so you
[33:10] have to also make uh include that in a
[33:14] transaction so for every uh table you
[33:17] you make for every document you make a
[33:19] transaction or how does this work sure
[33:21] so the immediate resistance that I get
[33:24] from bitcoiners is 300,000 jpeg on
[33:28] bitcoin you you you you defiler you you
[33:31] you graffiti artist and it's like no
[33:34] guys like that's why please go to open
[33:36] Tim stamps.org and study open timestamps
[33:39] like I said at the beginning I have yet
[33:41] to find a single bitcoiner that's
[33:42] against open Tim stamps and I know some
[33:45] very toxic bitcoiners like I've talked
[33:47] to the most toxic bitcoiners you can
[33:50] find about this and they're all like
[33:52] it's fine why because and let me show
[33:55] you again on my screen basically it's we
[33:58] are not doing uh a JPEG on bitcoin it's
[34:02] only the root hash that is going on the
[34:06] up return uh function of the of the time
[34:10] stamp so in this case what you're
[34:12] looking at your screen is like 1 2 3 4 5
[34:15] 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 I mean there's like
[34:18] hundreds of these jpegs all hashed
[34:22] together so it's the jpeg has a hash and
[34:25] it's strung through the open time stamps
[34:27] protocol to many many many other hashes
[34:31] and at the end it's just one hash so a
[34:33] single Hash a single transaction can
[34:36] actually contain the proof that you need
[34:38] for the entire database famously Peter
[34:42] Todd the Bitcoin core developer that
[34:43] created open timestamps uh one of the
[34:46] first things he did was hash the entire
[34:48] internet archive into a single
[34:50] transaction so you literally can have
[34:53] trillions of files all into one single
[34:57] tree
[34:58] and then one hash at the end is what you
[35:01] use as your anchor to bitcoin uh and so
[35:04] that's why Bitcoin becomes this anchor
[35:07] of Truth in a sea of lies that in the
[35:11] case of Elections you can use to
[35:13] differentiate fake documents that are
[35:15] produced by sock puppets on the internet
[35:18] from the official database that the
[35:20] government is using to um you know
[35:23] determine who wins I've never looked at
[35:26] open time stamps before that's a a um an
[35:30] disadvantage for me now but uh like when
[35:34] you uh verify something on bitcoin at
[35:38] some point you have to pay a transaction
[35:40] fees like at some point you you have to
[35:43] to kind of put it on there um is that
[35:46] like there are like a lot of things in
[35:48] uh on top of like in in one transactions
[35:51] there are like thousands or hundreds of
[35:53] things or how does this work exactly so
[35:56] uh I'll bring it back on the screen um
[35:58] now I'm taking you to the detail section
[36:00] of the transaction this specific uh root
[36:04] hash this transaction had 234 bytes
[36:07] right so out of the the one uh megabyte
[36:10] block uh that Bitcoin has this
[36:13] transaction used 234 bytes so it's you
[36:17] know one in about 4,000 transactions uh
[36:21] of that specific block so that is the
[36:25] block space that we're consuming you
[36:26] know one out of 4,000 we actually did
[36:29] four transactions per block so it was
[36:31] like one out of 1,000 transactions could
[36:34] contain and and really it's like just
[36:36] one you could contain all of the
[36:38] information of all the internet
[36:39] everywhere and so that's what I'm saying
[36:41] like this giant Merkel tree that could
[36:43] can contain trillions of files is a time
[36:46] stamp to bitcoin using 250 bytes simple
[36:50] proof did this for the Guatemalan
[36:52] election to make sure that the documents
[36:53] aren't altered but now our vision as a
[36:56] company is we want to live in a world
[36:59] where every single data piece of data
[37:02] Digital Data that a a government
[37:04] publishes either for public records or
[37:07] if you pay some you know a speeding
[37:10] ticket or uh you know when they issue
[37:12] your license you know whatever whenever
[37:15] a citizen interfaces with the state and
[37:18] you get some kind of receipt some
[37:20] document you should have a time stamp to
[37:24] prove that that document can never be
[37:26] manipulated um this is you know famously
[37:29] known as uh Orwell's dictum and Juliana
[37:31] Sange recently kind of put the idea out
[37:33] there again of saying Bitcoin can break
[37:35] Orwell's dictum because what or Orwell
[37:38] said was he who controls the present
[37:41] controls the past and he who controls
[37:43] the past controls the future it's
[37:45] another way of saying history is written
[37:48] by the winners because the winners can
[37:51] rewrite history and erase all the
[37:54] inconvenient things about history simple
[37:57] proof our goal our mission and vision is
[38:00] we want to live in a world where the
[38:03] government issues the public records and
[38:04] I can't imagine a world where government
[38:07] doesn't issue public records but at
[38:09] least they can't change their mind they
[38:12] can't erase the record and change it to
[38:16] suit their changing narrative whims
[38:19] prerogatives you know a new person comes
[38:21] in and suddenly they want to erase
[38:23] everything that happened that can end
[38:26] and we want to work on that and we did
[38:29] it for the national election of
[38:32] Guatemala in 2023 if you watch or listen
[38:36] to my podcast on a regular basis I'll
[38:38] guess you already bought some Bitcoin
[38:40] and now the most important step is to
[38:43] keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in a
[38:46] hardware wallet my personal
[38:48] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[38:49] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[38:52] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[38:54] friend who has still their Bitcoin on on

[39:09] to bulletproof your self- custody setup
[39:12] your security setup and maybe even your

[39:42] security in Bitcoin self custody and how
[39:45] to be a secure sovereign individual in
[39:49] general and for those of you who are in
[39:51] search of a new Bitcoin exchange where
[39:53] they can buy their Bitcoin from I
[39:55] recommend my personal Bitcoin change 21
[39:58] Bitcoin with code Robin you get a hefty
[40:01] discount for all your purchases in the
[40:04] future do you see um very far into the
[40:08] future and I have like two three
[40:10] episodes on that where we talk about
[40:12] like uix or management where we talked
[40:14] about potential future transaction sizes
[40:17] on on on on bitcoin uh and I think we're
[40:21] going to get to a future where
[40:23] transactions on the base layer will be
[40:24] just really expensive uh so like I I I
[40:28] really don't care what what what people
[40:30] do on the blockchain uh because if it's
[40:33] if if you can afford the transaction fee
[40:36] it it's fine like that's free market uh
[40:38] then there's a use case for that uh but
[40:41] do you think at some point when like
[40:43] really the whole world kind of uses that
[40:45] the the whole uh um the whole Bitcoin
[40:48] and transactions fees like at Thousand
[40:50] EUR or like even beyond that um first of
[40:54] like do you see the transaction fees
[40:56] rising to the levels and do you see
[40:58] possibility where like those things
[41:00] might not have space or like something
[41:02] like that so um yeah I'm I'm showing
[41:05] again on the screen the actual fee that
[41:07] was paid in that transaction it was
[41:09] 5,911 SATs which was a 38 sat per VB so
[41:14] we technically overpaid uh two twice as
[41:17] much as the normal transaction um
[41:20] obviously right now transaction fees are
[41:22] still pretty low even though 38 sat per
[41:24] V is is not necessarily low um I you
[41:28] know have I don't know what's going to
[41:31] happen with transaction fees um and I
[41:33] can't predict but the point here is if
[41:36] we do this it's a matter of maybe we
[41:39] have a few transactions per block that
[41:41] are paying you know very very high fees
[41:44] but if we are handling the entire you
[41:46] know voting records of all of the world
[41:49] democracies and all of the tax records
[41:51] and all of the uh you know public emails
[41:54] of important uh you know publicly
[41:57] elected officials I mean all if the
[41:59] entire world's information is being
[42:03] hashed into these transactions I believe
[42:06] that they will you know we will always
[42:08] afford to pay you know one out of every
[42:11] 1,000 transactions to include all the
[42:14] world's data so you're saying
[42:17] 99,999 of the transactions could be
[42:20] Financial or some other you know normal
[42:22] Bitcoin and then one out of every
[42:24] thousand transactions is the time stamp
[42:26] to all the world's data how much is the
[42:29] world willing to pay for that and to
[42:31] eliminate the ability of the state to
[42:34] erase history and and you know full
[42:38] Humanity um I think that's worth paying
[42:41] that's a valid point like it's really
[42:43] really cool maybe I don't know like how
[42:45] how how opinionated you are on this
[42:48] topic but when when you are going with
[42:51] with
[42:52] Bitcoin most people agree that Bitcoin
[42:55] is the best of value inside of Bitcoin
[42:57] like we have this 21 million that people
[42:59] agree on like this open time stamp that
[43:01] you said most people agree on and most
[43:04] people kind of agree like oh oh Bitcoin
[43:06] is an fantastic store value do you also
[43:08] think that Bitcoin will be a currency
[43:10] will be um maybe more than that some
[43:13] people say like we will build everything
[43:16] that's now on altcoins on top of layer
[43:18] twos and layer threes on top of Bitcoin
[43:20] where do you see the future of Bitcoin
[43:21] in
[43:22] general I am super bullish my my life's
[43:25] mission is to get Central America to
[43:29] adopt Bitcoin before the rest of the
[43:32] world I see it as a race right
[43:34] everything that I can do to push my
[43:37] region and specifically my country to
[43:41] win that race I want to do so because
[43:45] everything that I do like what I just
[43:47] showed you is helping me right like now
[43:49] the president of Guatemala his staff um
[43:52] you know Congress people in Congress
[43:54] judges they know they know about this
[43:57] because it was a huge drama in Guatemala
[43:59] where they tried to repeat the elections
[44:01] and you know they they were able to
[44:03] secure the elections and so all of these
[44:06] important people in the country know now
[44:08] that this use case existed and that
[44:10] Bitcoin helped to protect their um you
[44:13] know Victory and so it just makes my job
[44:16] as a bitcoiner in Guatemala easier to
[44:19] get people particularly people in power
[44:21] to understand that Bitcoin is a tool
[44:23] right and this stupid idea of oh uh
[44:27] criminals use Bitcoin it's like well
[44:28] criminals use cell phones uh criminals
[44:30] use automobiles use the internet does
[44:33] that mean that you're going to cancel
[44:35] yourself out of the internet Automobiles
[44:37] and cell phones it's like good luck
[44:39] right criminals wear clothing so are you
[44:42] going to start walking around naked
[44:44] right so it's like it it just makes it
[44:46] easier for me to orange pill my entire
[44:49] country but then obviously now that
[44:51] Guatemala has done this with its voting
[44:53] system I hope that people listening to
[44:55] this will you know visit proof.com and
[44:58] contact us because we are ready to take
[45:00] this everywhere in the world and your
[45:02] democracy could be the next one that
[45:05] uses this to protect themselves from
[45:07] attackers and now in terms of the you
[45:10] know uh blockchain because on the money
[45:13] side I'm you know completely convinced
[45:14] that Bitcoin is the only thing the Apex
[45:17] pred Predator that will destroy and eat
[45:19] everything else um but on the truth
[45:22] argument right because it's separate
[45:23] it's and I don't know if you know but
[45:25] famously some uh emails uh private
[45:27] emails from Satoshi came out uh during
[45:29] the Craig Wright case where Satoshi
[45:32] literally said like the only other use
[45:33] case that I can imagine for Bitcoin is
[45:36] timestamping so like this this goes back
[45:40] a while of like this is the like time
[45:42] stamping information has been known for
[45:44] a long time by bitcoiners as a useful
[45:46] tool like I said Juliana Sange spoke
[45:49] about this as the other the other thing
[45:50] that really you know excites him because
[45:53] we could make sure that everything that
[45:54] Wikileaks ever publishes is impossible
[45:58] to erase right that's pretty valuable
[46:00] and so um but that's a truth argument
[46:03] like I like I mentioned before it's it's
[46:05] not a money argument but in that
[46:08] argument we actually have an even
[46:10] stronger case than any of the uh crypto
[46:14] um uh blockchain people because why
[46:18] would you use any other blockchain if
[46:22] what you are hoping to do is secure
[46:25] information Bitcoin is the most secure
[46:28] by far and then because we're using open
[46:32] time stamps what we're doing is we could
[46:34] hash trillions of data into one single
[46:36] transaction so this isn't expensive this
[46:40] is actually cheap so if you're going to
[46:42] issue nfts on you know polygon or you
[46:46] know cardano like you're going to pay
[46:48] gas fees on that other chain and at the
[46:50] end of the day those chains are proof of
[46:52] stake chains that are run by companies
[46:54] and so you might as well just keep keep
[46:57] it on you know the data server uh that
[46:59] you were already running there's no
[47:01] difference between what we are currently
[47:03] doing than running it on another
[47:05] blockchain that's not Bitcoin the
[47:06] difference is when we have done this in
[47:09] Guatemala with Bitcoin is the government
[47:12] of Guatemala any attacking government
[47:14] hackers or individuals no one can change
[47:17] this data it just that is that's it
[47:20] right so we believe that it's important
[47:22] that as bitcoiners we bring this
[47:24] technology into public registry right
[47:27] government because it allows us to make
[47:29] the case that Bitcoin is the only tool
[47:31] to use for this all the other
[47:33] blockchains don't make sense and we need
[47:36] to do this fast right be because they
[47:39] are trying to get their technology used
[47:41] and trying to make it standard it should
[47:43] be standard operating procedure that all
[47:45] digital files everywhere on all the
[47:47] clouds of all the governments are
[47:49] timestamped to bitcoin because it's the
[47:51] only way the only way provable to
[47:55] demonstrate that no one can change
[47:57] history and so uh that's that's what I
[48:00] think that's a beautiful thing about the
[48:02] time chain I feel like um as you said it
[48:05] so nicely when we have the money and all
[48:07] the things that most people listening to
[48:11] that will probably understand um but the
[48:14] other aspect is like having an event
[48:17] that actually happened uh I mean it's it
[48:21] goes that easy to like just like I have
[48:24] a telegram chat and and and we wrote
[48:27] there and and we had some event and then
[48:29] people just like oh block height and
[48:31] then eight and stuff like that so like
[48:33] even that kind of uh is a form of time
[48:37] chain I mean telegram itself could be
[48:39] manipulated the D could be Rewritten but
[48:42] uh even that in itself is is kind of use
[48:45] of the time chain um do you also think
[48:47] that it it might be possible that the
[48:50] whole time system will will run at
[48:54] Bitcoin especially when the the
[48:55] confirmation of talks are not that
[48:58] predictable with sometimes 5 minutes
[48:59] sometimes 20 minutes and stuff like that
[49:01] I I'm I'm a fanatic right I uh um I
[49:05] believe that you know in a thousand
[49:07] years uh Bitcoin will be seen as that
[49:10] like before and after moment kind of
[49:12] like nowadays we we see Jesus as like
[49:17] the main like time stamp for when uh you
[49:20] know we start counting years right it's
[49:23] like it's 2024 why because Jesus was
[49:26] born 20 2024 years ago it's like um and
[49:30] obviously like we know that he wasn't
[49:32] literally born that year but whatever
[49:34] it's like um but you know thousands of
[49:37] years later you it's such an important
[49:39] event that changes Humanity so much that
[49:41] people use it as reference so I do think
[49:43] that over time that's going to happen
[49:46] but in the interim right in the long run
[49:48] Bitcoin wins of course like Bitcoin
[49:51] already won what we are uh discussing is
[49:54] how right how is that story going to be
[49:57] written and I think that part of that
[50:00] story is getting Bitcoin to become the
[50:03] timestamp know standard for all data
[50:06] everywhere and it's almost like um you
[50:09] know when the automobile was invented at
[50:12] first they had instead of having a
[50:14] steering wheel you had these like levers
[50:16] right you pull like a bunch of things to
[50:18] make the car turn because it was coming
[50:20] from the horse and you know the horse
[50:21] you would pull like on him and whatnot
[50:24] and eventually people figured out a
[50:25] steering wheel is much more intuitive
[50:28] for the automobile and so now like if
[50:31] you could see a a car that has these
[50:34] livers you would say how stupid could
[50:37] people have been right like that's what
[50:39] I hope will happen for digital
[50:41] information especially government public
[50:44] records in 10 years people should look
[50:46] back and say what were people thinking
[50:49] publishing public records without a time
[50:51] stamp to bitcoin like there's no like
[50:54] how can I trust anything that the
[50:55] government says if it doesn't have a
[50:58] time stamp to bitcoin like that's how we
[51:01] like how logical this is and why we are
[51:03] inviting people to reach out to us to to
[51:05] help us get this out there in more use
[51:07] cases so that we have more uses of this
[51:10] out there than any other shitcoin um
[51:13] because then it's easy to create that
[51:16] story and bring us to the point where
[51:19] Bitcoin is that standard right and we
[51:21] can look back and say that you know
[51:24] period of time between 2009 and
[51:28] 2025 when governments issued digital
[51:30] information and Bitcoin existed and they
[51:32] weren't timestamping it's like thinking
[51:34] of the automobile with levers it's like
[51:36] how could people do that it just seems
[51:40] silly it's it's fascinating for me
[51:42] especially when when we think about
[51:44] people outside of of Bitcoin like most
[51:46] people inside of Bitcoin kind of grasp
[51:49] more and more where Bitcoin is going and
[51:51] and how significant Bitcoin actually is
[51:53] for us um but for people outside of uh
[51:56] Bitcoin I sometimes have a hard time
[51:58] explaining them how significant this is
[52:01] they they still think it's oh it's it's
[52:03] some asset it's like oh yeah I I also
[52:06] have some silver in my portfolio so
[52:07] something like that um C can you make
[52:11] the case or make make the uh or can you
[52:14] give us an an picture in our heads or
[52:17] painting us a picture in our head how
[52:19] significant it is to own like one
[52:21] Bitcoin in like 20 50 years how how
[52:24] significant that will be I mean aot a
[52:26] lot of people just use an US dollar
[52:27] price target for that but I'm not the
[52:30] the best fan of that like do do you do
[52:32] you have some significance for like
[52:34] owning one whole Bitcoin or something
[52:36] like that of course I mean the answer is
[52:38] no no one has enough right like that's
[52:40] that's that's the truth no no one has
[52:42] enough Bitcoin um and uh that but yeah I
[52:47] mean what you were saying to to how to
[52:48] drive home the fact that people that oh
[52:50] yeah I have silver right I have gold
[52:53] like I own real estate as a hedge
[52:55] against inflation it's like well um
[52:57] that's why you doing something like this
[52:59] and getting to the point where oh your
[53:01] your election system it was protected by
[53:03] Bitcoin right like um I can talk to the
[53:07] president about that now and so it's
[53:09] just a lot easier to explain to the
[53:11] president you know that's how powerful
[53:13] this is and and yet Guatemala has zero
[53:16] Bitcoin on the balance sheet and El
[53:17] Salvador has
[53:20] 5,700 some number right like every day
[53:22] they're buying one full Bitcoin and
[53:24] Guatemala has a zero
[53:26] like you how is it that our democracy
[53:29] depends on bitcoin as its like final you
[53:33] know shield to protect itself and yet
[53:36] our balance sheet our money doesn't like
[53:40] this is it's creating more use cases and
[53:44] more narratives where enough of them
[53:46] will short circuit all of the the the
[53:49] fear and certainty and doubt that has
[53:51] happened over the last 15 years that a
[53:54] lot of people are you know uh
[53:56] you know unfortunately just kind of
[53:58] under the weight of but you this this
[54:01] truth argument this democracy this
[54:02] public registry information can Pierce
[54:05] through that right and eventually once
[54:07] once a person starts to say well uh you
[54:11] know I I can prove that our our election
[54:13] was Secure because I can show you on
[54:15] bitcoin and did you know Bitcoin has
[54:17] 50,000 you know nodes throughout the
[54:19] world and and and and and then you're
[54:21] like well and so is it on your balance
[54:22] sheet they're like oh no no no I I only
[54:25] care about Bitcoin protect my you know
[54:28] information Integrity not my money then
[54:30] you're like what are you talking about
[54:32] obvious or at least should make it
[54:35] easier for us and so it's the the
[54:37] argument for doing this is like it's do
[54:39] it for Bitcoin so that we have more uh
[54:42] uh you know weapons to fight the the the
[54:45] the fud battle right of just do it for
[54:47] the Arsenal of examples that we can show
[54:49] people and so yeah be the fact that I I
[54:52] I know for sure understanding open time
[54:54] stamps and Bitcoin Bitcoin can protect
[54:57] all of digital information in the entire
[54:59] world from Ever Changing and eliminating
[55:02] the possibility of humanity living in
[55:05] 1984 type scenario where the state and
[55:08] the government controls us and and knows
[55:10] everything um eliminating that just as a
[55:14] byproduct of Bitcoin like that that
[55:16] gives you a sense of how important
[55:18] Bitcoin will be for Humanity 50 100 a
[55:21] thousand years from now and so if you
[55:24] have even one been going to pass on to
[55:28] your children and
[55:29] grandchildren they they will remember
[55:32] you forever right that's that's very
[55:34] cool um I feel like um when we are in
[55:37] 2024 and we talk about elections we we
[55:39] we kind of have to talk about the
[55:41] American elections that's coming up as
[55:43] also like 50% of my audience actually
[55:46] comes from America um and then also
[55:49] Trump uh and uh ER Robert um Kennedy
[55:55] junor uh and how start Vivic rasav I
[55:59] think all those three will be actually
[56:01] at the Nashville conference in uh now
[56:04] it's like two weeks when this is out
[56:06] we'll be like right around the the
[56:08] Nashville conference um what's your
[56:10] thoughts right now on the American
[56:12] elections and and how significant is
[56:14] that that the Trump and other candidates
[56:17] are actually at Nashville conference
[56:20] well um I'll be at Nashville simple
[56:22] proof we'll have a a little kiosk so if
[56:24] you are going to Nashville please uh
[56:26] look for us we will be there and um I'm
[56:30] also speaking uh at Nashville I'm doing
[56:33] a fireside chat with Peter Todd the the
[56:35] protocol developer of of open time
[56:37] stamps and we are speaking at uh 1:30 pm
[56:40] on Saturday uh up until 2m and then
[56:43] Trump is speaking at 2 pm and so uh
[56:46] different stages but so I'm a little
[56:48] nervous that I will be speaking about
[56:50] and the title of the talk is
[56:52] timestamping elections to avoid a
[56:55] show so to to all the uh you know United
[56:58] States and bitcoiners listening to this
[57:00] uh yeah it's going to be a show I
[57:03] think you can guarantee that uh in
[57:06] November but Bitcoin actually helps us
[57:10] avoid that um and actually if you want I
[57:13] can share my screen and it's the fact
[57:15] that this was used like you could ask so
[57:18] what what was what's the the point of
[57:20] using uh Bitcoin to protect your voting
[57:22] system and so what I'm showing on your
[57:24] screen is the uh election crimes unit
[57:27] argument of the Guatemalan justice
[57:30] system saying why the election was
[57:33] stolen and it's
[57:35] basically um on the x- axis is voting
[57:39] day right um and so it's zero hours on
[57:43] on Election Day in 2023 and it goes for
[57:45] about two days so 48 hours and then on
[57:48] the y- axis it's uh the number of
[57:50] documents generated by the system and so
[57:53] the election Crim unit in Guatemala is
[57:55] taking the elction authorities to court
[57:58] accusing them of election fraud by
[58:00] arguing that the Smoking Gun evidence is
[58:03] that
[58:04] jpegs published by the authorities have
[58:07] in the
[58:08] metadata um timestamps that are prior to
[58:12] the poll's closing so how is it that a a
[58:16] JPEG file can exist prior to the poll's
[58:19] closing that for them has been this is
[58:21] proof and evidence that there was
[58:23] election manipulation and therefore a
[58:25] crime
[58:27] however when you overlay the information
[58:30] on bitcoin instead of seeing information
[58:33] from uh coming from different uh times
[58:37] suddenly there is a normal distribution
[58:40] that happens after 6PM but more
[58:43] importantly this biggest chunk over here
[58:48] well I mean that's 50% of the files have
[58:52] a time stamp that is in the future
[58:56] compared to the time stamp to bitcoin
[58:58] and so why do you use this technology to
[59:02] avoid a show because thanks to the
[59:04] election authorities using Bitcoin we
[59:06] can prove
[59:07] mathematically that there was no
[59:10] election fraud
[59:12] otherwise there would need to be proof
[59:14] that time travelers hacked the
[59:17] Guatemalan election because there is no
[59:19] way that a JPEG can exist in the future
[59:22] when it existed in the past on bitcoin
[59:25] the more plausible explanation is that
[59:28] someone made a mistake and this is what
[59:30] you know tying it to what you were
[59:31] talking about in Austria where the glue
[59:33] like wasn't done well in Guatemala in
[59:36] 2023 the contractor that was generating
[59:39] the files misconfigured the time zones
[59:42] in 3% of the computers and so they
[59:46] thought they were in the Pacific Islands
[59:49] uh you know 11 hours ahead of Guatemala
[59:52] and then 53% of the hardware thought it
[59:56] was in Baghdad Iraq but when you con
[59:59] when you correct for the time zone error
[60:02] it all sandwiches into Guatemalan time
[60:05] zone and so it provides cryptographic
[60:08] proof that it was a mistake and so
[60:12] instead of falling into the show of
[60:14] people saying election fraud this or
[60:16] that Bitcoin provides that anchor of
[60:19] Truth where you can look at and say o we
[60:22] can prove that this is what happened and
[60:23] this you know it's not about my guy last
[60:26] year guy won it's this is what literally
[60:28] happened and so you know why am I saying
[60:31] this it's we are literally taking this
[60:33] argument to Nashville and and I'm
[60:34] calling upon bitcoiners everywhere to
[60:36] reach out to us because the way that the
[60:39] United States election system works is
[60:41] that there are 50 states each one has
[60:44] their own election law inside each state
[60:48] the authorities responsible for carrying
[60:50] out the voting are County clerks so
[60:53] small local government and those the
[60:56] guys that could use this technology to
[60:59] keep them from going to jail and so it's
[61:02] very cheap insurance for your local
[61:05] Authority that means that there's about
[61:07] 3,000 counties in the United States so
[61:11] there's about 3,000 people in the USA
[61:14] that could choose to use Bitcoin to
[61:16] protect the voting system and my message
[61:18] to bitcoiners is what are the odds that
[61:21] that election Authority is your neighbor
[61:24] your cousin your dad ad or yourself
[61:28] right at this point bitcoiners are
[61:30] everywhere there's a chance that that
[61:32] one of those 3,000 is already a
[61:34] bitcoiner or is a very close friend to a
[61:36] bitcoiner and so please reach out to us
[61:38] because in November that person could
[61:41] use Bitcoin to protect themselves
[61:44] against a stupid mistake like time zone
[61:47] misconfiguration or glue you know
[61:50] problems and just use Bitcoin so that if
[61:54] the hits the fan and we know it's
[61:57] going to be a show you have Bitcoin
[62:00] and Bitcoin becomes an anchor of Truth
[62:02] in a sea of Lies the benefit to that
[62:06] person is they can keep themselves from
[62:08] going to jail if they are unlucky to be
[62:11] accused of election fraud and the
[62:12] benefit to bitcoiners is by December we
[62:15] can credibly say that Bitcoin protects
[62:19] democracy and if Bitcoin protects
[62:21] democracy in the United States of
[62:23] America then if you're against Bitcoin
[62:25] you must be against
[62:27] democracy I love it a lot um we had last
[62:32] year no last time uh Trump was not
[62:36] elected Biden was elected heavy
[62:38] allegations from Trump's side from uh
[62:41] the Republicans that there was election
[62:43] fraud I mean we had the whole whole
[62:45] traum around that um might be Trump a
[62:49] big fan of of of exactly your project we
[62:53] shall see in Nashville we are taking
[62:55] this argument to the Genesis stage um
[62:58] and we'll have a kiosk there and we're
[63:00] talking to everyone there there's
[63:01] already about eight bitcoiners or in
[63:04] eight different states that have reached
[63:06] out to us so please we are you know
[63:08] simple proof.com we're on Noster as
[63:11] simple prooof I'm on Twitter as Carlos
[63:13] Toro um you'll maybe include that link
[63:16] because it'll be hard to to find um and
[63:19] just reach out to us because uh we also
[63:21] offer a 5% referral fee so if you
[63:24] introduce us to a local government that
[63:26] uses this and we sign a contract we'll
[63:29] give you 5% of that contract that being
[63:31] said it's it's you know do it really
[63:33] more to because if you're the one that
[63:35] gets us introduced to to to to the you
[63:38] know your local government that we do
[63:40] this then you become the legendary
[63:43] bitcoiner who got Bitcoin inside the
[63:46] United States voting system and will'll
[63:49] timestamp that and and it will live
[63:51] forever right you can be that legendary
[63:54] bitcoiner that created this AR this
[63:57] Narrative of Bitcoin protects democracy
[64:00] so that next time that uh some
[64:03] politician is arguing that the Bitcoin
[64:05] miners are using too much energy and we
[64:08] should shut them down because it's these
[64:10] mathematical formulas that just waste
[64:12] energy we can you know bring in your
[64:15] local Authority and ask you know did
[64:18] Bitcoin help you like is bitcoin useful
[64:21] to protect voting and if you if now you
[64:24] are going against the system arguing
[64:26] Bitcoin protects democracy we can't shut
[64:29] down the miners because the miners are
[64:31] protecting democracy then we've flipped
[64:35] you know most of the attacks against us
[64:37] on their head and that should protect
[64:40] the network from these political attacks
[64:42] from these alleged you know democracy
[64:45] lovers um and you know expose them for
[64:48] the frauds that they are and demonstrate
[64:51] bitcoin's utility like I said in truth
[64:55] and in the only you know credible
[64:58] database in the entire world I mean
[65:00] that's um a massive incentive for people
[65:04] to do that I'm I really love that uh
[65:07] that you on the mission and that uh that
[65:10] you did that in Guatemala and I can only
[65:12] Wonder um how long it take but it's
[65:15] probably faster than we think with with
[65:17] Bitcoin and with the network effect and
[65:19] people getting it and like who could
[65:22] imagine just like two years ago that the
[65:25] current president of like the the
[65:27] probably next president or like the
[65:30] former president uh Trump is talking so
[65:33] openly about Bitcoin that he goes to
[65:34] bitcoin conferences uh and it's not that
[65:37] yeah is a Bitcoin I don't think so but
[65:39] he uh definitely knows that he needs to
[65:43] talk about Bitcoin we we haven't Like
[65:46] For Better or Worse Bitcoin has become a
[65:48] political issue in this campaign it's
[65:50] not the most important issue but it is
[65:51] an issue and so let's not waste the
[65:54] opportunity to say to negotiate with
[65:57] these political forces and say oh you
[65:59] you you want our vote well then let's
[66:01] get Bitcoin to protect the information
[66:05] and I'll I'll emphasize simple proof.com
[66:08] our solution is an information Integrity
[66:11] solution this doesn't mean that we want
[66:13] to you know touch your ballots this
[66:17] doesn't mean we want like to no no none
[66:19] of that this is literally just a backup
[66:22] of your data like your local author
[66:26] during the elections they will produce
[66:28] some data how in whatever process they
[66:31] have we adapt to it and this just runs
[66:34] as a parallel you know independent
[66:37] notary you know a digital notary of what
[66:41] happened and so it's in terms of
[66:43] implementation if you're wondering in
[66:45] Guatemala the election authorities
[66:47] signed the contract four days prior to
[66:50] the election and we were still able to
[66:53] implement the technology because it's
[66:56] simple yeah simple proof right it's
[66:59] reduced all the complexity and make it
[67:01] so that you know a few buttons are
[67:03] clicked and boom the magic just happens
[67:06] and it works you know opentime
[67:08] stamps.org uh if you go you can see how
[67:11] easy it is for an individual it's much
[67:12] harder for in institutions especially
[67:15] like governments that you know so we we
[67:17] just make all of that very simple uh but
[67:19] of course if you're listening to this
[67:21] reach out to your election Authority ask
[67:23] them do you have a plan come November if
[67:27] you know Russian hackers attack you with
[67:30] artificial intelligence if your
[67:32] contractor makes a mistake and deletes
[67:35] all the data uh or has the wrong time
[67:38] zones or there's a power outage just
[67:40] like it's purely just a redundancy you
[67:43] know insurance plan that you can point
[67:47] to what happened in Guatemala and tell
[67:49] them these guys have a cheap solution
[67:51] because it's not expensive and it's
[67:54] already help helping election
[67:56] authorities in Guatemala avoid going to
[67:59] jail so you should at least take a look
[68:01] at this right because who wants to go to
[68:03] jail right and so um yeah we're just
[68:07] putting up the bat signal and and and
[68:09] you know there are already eight people
[68:10] working on this that want to become that
[68:13] legendary bitcoiner so uh you know reach
[68:16] out soon because the race is
[68:19] on I love it a lot um before we come to
[68:23] our end routin I have one question that
[68:25] always ask my ask ask my my guests to
[68:28] get something outside of Bitcoin into
[68:30] the podcast um what can we learn from
[68:33] you besides Bitcoin like I said uh
[68:37] democracy I'm not going to ask you to
[68:39] believe in it I'm going to call you I
[68:42] call on you to see it and particularly
[68:44] the voting system you know who cares
[68:47] about who's competing at it's just the
[68:48] voting system is a consensus algorithm
[68:52] that a lot of people care about and it
[68:55] provides a proxy a a different touch
[68:58] point to reach people with a message
[69:01] that eventually leads to bitcoin right
[69:05] these voting systems consume our
[69:07] attention consume our energy sometimes
[69:10] create conditions for war and there's
[69:14] this other consensus algorithm that
[69:16] reaches perfect cons well not perfect
[69:18] but is the best consensus possible and
[69:22] it's every 10 minutes so I encourage you
[69:26] to consider democracy as a means of
[69:29] reaching people with a different message
[69:31] you're probably at this point sick of
[69:33] working for the Bitcoin marketing team
[69:35] sick of talking to your family members
[69:37] they all think you're crazy but if you
[69:39] talk to them about this then and and
[69:41] there's a 15-minute documentary that you
[69:43] could send them immutable democracy to
[69:46] say this happened in Guatemala
[69:48] Guatemala's democracy was defended and
[69:51] in in no small part we may still be a
[69:53] democracy just because of Bitcoin so
[69:55] it's not about hey you know forget about
[69:58] gold and real estate like that's a much
[69:59] harder argument so I I invite you to to
[70:02] do that because um you know monarchies
[70:06] autocracies they they are becoming you
[70:08] know more popular and you know go for it
[70:10] if you want to go you know live in in
[70:12] Dubai or some other you know autocratic
[70:15] State go for it but realize that
[70:18] democracies may be a you know Factory of
[70:21] bitcoiners every voting system we can
[70:24] use this to just drive home the fact
[70:26] that Bitcoin is useful that's not
[70:28] something that autocracies have and so I
[70:31] believe that democracies have a unique
[70:33] advantage to adopt Bitcoin faster than
[70:37] autocracies simply because of the proof
[70:39] of work consensus algorithm that voting
[70:41] systems represent and the fact that it
[70:44] lowers people's uh um barriers to being
[70:48] curious and and and studying Bitcoin
[70:50] really cool um let's come to the end
[70:52] rtin where the previous guest is asking
[70:54] a question for the next guest without
[70:56] knowing who the next guest is um this
[70:58] question is even even hard to ask
[71:01] because it's so long and it has so much
[71:03] things in there I might like I might
[71:06] have to repeat it I I had to let it
[71:09] repeat to to myself first time I heard
[71:11] it um what is the one thing that you can
[71:14] do and enjoy that you doing H that you
[71:19] don't get paid that helps others and why
[71:21] aren't you doing more of it why am I not
[71:23] doing more of it I well some some people
[71:26] would say I'm doing too much of it um I
[71:28] am auditing my uh election uh so I
[71:32] believe that running uh nodes is
[71:35] important We should strive to try to get
[71:37] as many people to run nodes and I am the
[71:40] first person in the history of Guatemala
[71:44] to run a full node on the voting system
[71:48] so I verified the entire voting system
[71:51] and I check the entire thing against
[71:53] what they are publishing to find the
[71:55] discrepancies and and and and the
[71:57] matches to start
[72:00] identifying whether or not our democracy
[72:03] is legitimate um and I'm going I am
[72:06] doing more of it I I I Tred to do it in
[72:08] El Salvador and in Panama Republic
[72:11] Dominicana Mexico and I'm actually also
[72:13] open to doing it in the States this is
[72:14] separate to simple proof uh if you're
[72:16] curious It's digital
[72:19] witness. um and I do want to do more of
[72:21] it it's just hard to get into other
[72:23] people's democracies and and their
[72:24] voting systems it's a you need to be
[72:26] invited uh but yes I'm I'm an election
[72:29] auditor and I believe that auditing
[72:31] elections is effectively running a full
[72:33] node on Democracy um and I think that if
[72:37] more that's why democracies present this
[72:39] opportunity to farm not just people
[72:42] exposed to bitcoin as a new touch point
[72:44] but to farm node Runners uh and I think
[72:47] we need more node Runners and
[72:49] democracies can create that so it's
[72:53] basically I came for democracy but I
[72:56] stayed for big um Carlos thank you for
[72:59] for being on thank you for explaining
[73:00] what what you're doing uh thank you for
[73:02] joining us today for Al also for
[73:04] everyone watching and listening thank
[73:06] you for joining us today I'll be back
[73:07] tomorrow with another episode bye-bye
