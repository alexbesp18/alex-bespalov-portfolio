[00:00] [Music]
[00:07] the top five feeds of this week we have
[00:10] the spot Bitcoin ETF we have Michael Z
[00:13] we have K Woods we have Lynn Alden um
[00:16] let's go the number one is from Dylan
[00:19] leair the murder rate in El Salvador has
[00:21] fallen from being the worldest highest
[00:25] 1003 per 100K in
[00:28] 2015 to the lowest in the Western
[00:30] Hemisphere at 2.3 per 100K in 2023 this
[00:36] shows perfectly how Bitcoin can help a
[00:39] country Prosper again El Salvador had in
[00:42] 2015 the highest murder rate then in
[00:45] 2021 they adapted Bitcoin and now in
[00:48] 2023 they are having the lowest murder
[00:52] rate in the Western Hemisphere Bitcoin
[00:54] is good for business not only for a
[00:56] small ple not only for Bankers not only
[00:59] for or a publicly traded company but
[01:02] it's also good for business for
[01:03] countries number two is from the Bitcoin
[01:06] Magazine global currencies against the
[01:09] US Dollars over the last 10 years and
[01:11] then you can see a big list of global
[01:14] currencies and the value against the
[01:16] dollar from the worst from Venezuela to
[01:18] the best to Swiss every single currency
[01:22] is losing against the dollar the dollar
[01:23] is clearly the strongest currency but
[01:25] there's one Global Currency that's
[01:27] simply the strongest of over the last 5
[01:30] years over the last 10 years it's
[01:32] Bitcoin
[01:33] 21,000% against the US Dollars over the
[01:36] last 10 years so for every person that
[01:39] is on not the US dollar Bitcoin is a
[01:42] lifeline and even for the people on a US
[01:46] dollar Bitcoin is still a Lifeline but
[01:49] imagine that you experience High
[01:51] inflation in Europe in America in the
[01:54] Western Hemisphere imagine how much
[01:56] worse it is for people in Venezuela
[01:58] Bitcoin is needed there Bitcoin is the
[02:01] only stable thing they can rely on
[02:04] number three is from Lynn Ardon and she
[02:07] asks a very very simple question you
[02:10] think you own your bank deposits clear
[02:13] answer no I don't think so and everyone
[02:15] that thinks that should rethink it if
[02:17] you have euros dollars whatever in a
[02:20] bank account you have the right to that
[02:23] piece of financial energy but you don't
[02:25] really own it if the bank says no sorry
[02:28] we don't give out your money you cannot
[02:30] get it out so better get some Bitcoin
[02:33] better get the Bitcoin out of exchanges
[02:35] and better learn how to manage your keys
[02:38] number four from the Bitcoin archive SEC
[02:41] delayed decision on kwoods spot Bitcoin
[02:45] ETF again they approved a Bitcoin
[02:47] Futures ETF a leverage ETF and a short
[02:50] ETF crazy but they refuse do this day to
[02:54] approve a spot Bitcoin ETF and
[02:57] apparently even the US court agreed Year
[03:00] my honest opinion it doesn't matter it
[03:02] will come anyways it will come maybe
[03:04] this year next year in two years I don't
[03:06] know when but it will come there's not
[03:08] the question if it comes there's so much
[03:11] pressure right now on Gary gansler on
[03:13] the SEC and all the players involved in
[03:16] that game they have to approve a Bitcoin
[03:18] spot ETF at some point and even if they
[03:21] don't Bitcoin doesn't care Bitcoin
[03:23] doesn't fail just because there is no
[03:25] spot ETF they cannot kill Bitcoin we are
[03:29] Beyond the point of killing Bitcoin
[03:32] number five is our farmer Michael sailor
[03:35] he with micro strategy just bought
[03:38] another
[03:39] $147 Million worth of bitcoin they hold
[03:43] now over 4.6 billion US dollars in
[03:48] Bitcoin wow he is he is not stopping
[03:53] till he has all the Bitcoin it ain't
[03:55] much but it's
[03:58] 8,2
[04:00] 245 Bitcoin he will buy all the Bitcoin
[04:03] and remember if you sell Bitcoin Michael
[04:06] sailor might buy it so keep that in mind
[04:09] goodbye and I'll see you in the next one
