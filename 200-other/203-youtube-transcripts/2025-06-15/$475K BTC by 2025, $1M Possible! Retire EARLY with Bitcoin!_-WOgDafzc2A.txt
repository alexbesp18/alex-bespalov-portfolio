[00:00] where would we be next Christmas I think
[00:01] much higher from here I have a fourth
[00:03] quarter price target of
[00:05] $475,000 per Bitcoin quit making trades
[00:08] based on your emotion Bitcoin is the
[00:10] world's greatest savings technology that
[00:12] the world has ever seen in the history
[00:14] of humanity there is no greater
[00:16] opportunity cost than to not own Bitcoin
[00:18] please start using it as your savings
[00:21] technology buy it hold it and if you
[00:23] just do this as hard as you can for 10
[00:25] years it will change your life you're
[00:27] going to look up it'll be Christmas of
[00:28] 2034 you'll be like oh my goodness I
[00:31] have optionality now I could quit my job
[00:33] right now I could retire I could go be
[00:35] an artist instead of being a starving
[00:36] artist you could be supported by Bitcoin
[00:38] I wouldn't be surprised if we actually
[00:39] touch a million dollars per Bitcoin in
[00:41] this cycle I think it's inevitable I
[00:43] think that it absolutely is going to
[00:45] take over the world and become
[00:47] ubiquitous like the way the internet has
[00:49] taken over the world and become
[00:50] ubiquitous and now the internet is
[00:52] basically everywhere same as electricity
[00:54] people used to not have electricity now
[00:56] most of the world has their houses and
[00:58] their businesses electrified
[01:01] [Music]
[01:04] two popular chefs in in the Bitcoin area
[01:06] Jeff poof and Jeff Ross I get I we get
[01:09] mistaken all the time I get letters
[01:11] saying that the my book has impacted
[01:15] their lives I'm like I think you're
[01:16] talking about Jeff Booth you're talking
[01:17] about you know it's it's really funny
[01:20] people think we're the same person often
[01:22] really with like a different last name
[01:25] yeah they just assume it's a popular
[01:27] Jeff in the Bitcoin space so I don't do
[01:30] many public as many public appearances
[01:32] anymore so that's that's been helpful so
[01:35] they don't get us confused as much now
[01:37] but that's like with the last name I I
[01:40] can understand it more if maybe if you
[01:42] have the same name obviously then it
[01:44] would be real but the the same first
[01:46] name that's interesting but yeah let's
[01:47] get started with that hi Jeff how are
[01:49] you doing uh everything fine on your end
[01:51] I'm doing really well Robin thanks for
[01:53] having me on your show really cool and
[01:55] we don't record this on Christmas so
[01:57] it's like 19th of December today but
[01:59] after like I will uh publish that on
[02:02] Christmas so the first thing I just want
[02:04] to show uh here is the the the Bitcoin
[02:07] price chart on Christmas because that's
[02:09] was the only thing that I could relate
[02:10] to to Christmas and show I don't know
[02:12] maybe you have uh something else that we
[02:15] can can put in there for for Christmas
[02:17] stuff and I found one uh uh just table
[02:21] uh that we can we can look at at the
[02:24] different price points of at Christmas I
[02:26] I wasn't aware that we were that low
[02:28] actually that's more than a 2x from from
[02:30] last year's Christmas and 2022 was like
[02:33] with 16k that was kind of the the lowest
[02:36] point uh how do you look at that and uh
[02:38] maybe uh give us some some of your
[02:41] outlooks for what what we can uh wait
[02:44] for till the ne till next Christmas yeah
[02:47] so I think that's very telling I like
[02:49] looking at end of year type things so
[02:50] Christmas is a great um date to to look
[02:53] at when I look at these prices all I see
[02:56] are the four-year price cycles and the
[02:59] um the the big um M2 surges in there
[03:02] that Peak basically in 2013 and then
[03:04] again in
[03:05] 2017
[03:07] 2021 uh and then I think we're going to
[03:09] probably get the next one in 2025 where
[03:11] we're going to get another uh yeah 2025
[03:14] so another surge as we head into this
[03:17] next year so you know we're right where
[03:19] we are before I nuked my my Twitter X
[03:21] account um uh I I had posted lots of
[03:24] things I like to make little predictions
[03:26] just not not to like um to flex or not
[03:29] to give anybody any type of investment
[03:31] advice or anything like that it's just
[03:33] for me to sort of keep a diary of my
[03:35] running thoughts as I study things and
[03:37] and and look at the Bitcoin cycle and
[03:39] look at macro conditions and things like
[03:41] that my um my assessment at least a year
[03:45] and two years ago was that by Christmas
[03:47] of 2024 so right about where we are now
[03:50] is that the price of Bitcoin would be
[03:52] between1 and
[03:54] $125,000 uh and so that's about where we
[03:56] are we've kind of hit my targets um we
[03:58] may have peaked already for the for the
[04:00] year at about 108 um, and the reason I
[04:04] say that is because the dollar is very
[04:07] strong and when the dollar is too strong
[04:09] that makes it very hard for risk assets
[04:11] to perform well makes it hard for
[04:12] Bitcoin to perform well um but who knows
[04:15] we may still get a run into the end of
[04:17] the year up to closer to 120 or 125 not
[04:20] it wouldn't surprise me either way um
[04:22] but yeah so where and then where would
[04:24] we be next Christmas I think much higher
[04:26] from here uh I have a fourth quarter
[04:28] price target of 400 $175,000 per Bitcoin
[04:31] I've been saying that for a couple years
[04:33] nothing has changed I still have that
[04:35] same Target um but I wouldn't be and
[04:38] again not me flexing not me making some
[04:41] incredible prediction I don't know the
[04:42] future I think the range could be
[04:44] anywhere between 200k and a million
[04:47] dollars it might even pop above a
[04:49] million dollars um but to me that like
[04:52] around 475 makes the most sense so I'm
[04:54] still sticking with that Target until
[04:56] something changes yeah it's it's still a
[05:00] pretty bullish Target because I I keep
[05:02] asking people and the the the things
[05:05] that are here is like 250 350k that's
[05:08] kind of the consensus that I hear most
[05:10] people say like 450k is not that far
[05:12] away from 350k but it's it's the the
[05:15] current price on that above there uh
[05:19] really interesting
[05:21] um you said one thing that I just want
[05:23] to quickly touch on you said like a risk
[05:25] asset with Bitcoin it's it's uh funny
[05:28] because for me Bitcoin is completely
[05:30] risk off asset and and I feel Al also
[05:32] you see it like that but uh it's still
[05:35] categorized as as a risk asset um risk
[05:38] meaning volatility in those eyes right
[05:42] yes so yeah that's a popular thing I
[05:44] like to say all the time is risk only
[05:46] equals volatility in Academia so I got
[05:49] my MBA in finance right and so all the
[05:52] all the financial professors will tell
[05:53] you that the way to measure risk is to
[05:56] look at volatility of an asset and I
[05:59] think that's very misleading I think you
[06:00] know even when this was first um drubbed
[06:03] up as a solution decades ago of how can
[06:06] you quantify risk in a stock um even
[06:10] even then the sort of founders of the
[06:12] idea didn't like that they didn't think
[06:14] that was a very great measurement but it
[06:16] was kind of the best thing that they
[06:18] came up with um but then it stuck like
[06:20] everything in academics things stick
[06:22] even if they don't make a lot of uh
[06:24] sense in the real world um I tell people
[06:26] the only true Financial Risk is the
[06:29] chance of losing your purchasing power
[06:31] over time um and so what's ironic about
[06:34] that is that makes Bitcoin extremely
[06:40] [Music]
[06:41] unrisked even though it's very volatile
[06:44] um I think something that people don't
[06:46] think is risky but is very risky is the
[06:49] US dollar if you hold dollars or you
[06:51] hold us treasuries which are considered
[06:54] the risk-free asset for the world you
[06:56] are guaranteed to lose your purchasing
[06:58] power over time the longer you hold the
[07:01] dollar the more guaranteed you are that
[07:04] you will lose your purchasing power
[07:05] that's very risky to me even though it's
[07:07] not volatile at all um it's really
[07:09] stupid and very risky so as a hedge fund
[07:12] manager I would never hold dollars for
[07:15] the long term I would never hold
[07:17] treasuries for the long term only for a
[07:18] very short term um otherwise I'm just
[07:21] I'm going to lose my client's purchasing
[07:23] power over time and that's really stupid
[07:25] which is a funny thing because a lot of
[07:28] um I have a lot of Normy friends even my
[07:30] sister uh they kind of don't want to
[07:34] invest at all because they feel like oh
[07:37] the euro is that safe thing and
[07:39] everything outside I have a risk of
[07:41] losing my money because they denominate
[07:44] everything in euros and they're like if
[07:45] I go out of Euros I might lose my Euros
[07:49] but they're not looking at the
[07:50] purchasing power they're just looking at
[07:51] the Euros of the ninal things that's
[07:54] something I'm I get enraged if I if I
[07:57] encounter such a conversation right
[07:59] right you know in a great so case in
[08:01] point one of the things I P I used to
[08:03] publish on Twitter all the time now I
[08:04] publish it over on Noster is every month
[08:07] the Federal Reserve updates their site I
[08:09] don't I don't care a lot for a lot of
[08:11] their data but but one of the funny
[08:13] things they have is a page called buying
[08:15] eggs with Bitcoins and they they
[08:18] literally publish this so I publish the
[08:19] updated results every month and what
[08:21] that shows is well let me start back
[08:23] they started this in 2015 to show that
[08:27] you know even though Bitcoin everybody
[08:29] was excited about it at the time it's
[08:30] way too volatile to use as a as a unit
[08:33] of account and as a medium of exchange
[08:35] and and we're going to sort of prove
[08:37] that to the world so they have two
[08:38] charts on that page the first one is the
[08:40] price of eggs a dozen eggs uh in US
[08:43] dollar terms and then this if you go
[08:45] below that if you scroll below there's
[08:47] the price of a dozen eggs in Bitcoin
[08:49] terms or Satoshi um what's hilarious
[08:52] about that and we can all predict what
[08:54] actually happened is what it shows is
[08:55] the price of eggs in the in the United
[08:57] States just keeps going up and up up and
[08:59] up and the price of eggs in Bitcoin
[09:02] terms goes down and down and down and so
[09:05] uh what I like to do is um I'll post
[09:07] rolling fiveyear averages so looking
[09:09] back five years what what is how has the
[09:12] world changed how have how has our
[09:13] grocery bill changed over the last five
[09:16] years which is a good proxy for eggs um
[09:19] or eggs is a good proxy for our grocery
[09:21] bill in general you can do this with
[09:22] other Foods too like beef I'll do
[09:24] sometimes and other other things but
[09:26] basically what it shows is over the last
[09:28] five years our grocery bills have
[09:30] actually gone up about two and a half
[09:33] times uh and in the last access denied
[09:37] uh and in the last um uh five years the
[09:40] price of of groceries in Bitcoin terms
[09:42] or in this case the price of eggs has
[09:44] gone down by less by more than 50% so
[09:47] the grocery bill has been more than cut
[09:49] in half if you're on a Bitcoin standard
[09:51] um so again that's to your point right
[09:53] if for people who are scared of losing
[09:56] their dollars or losing their Euro Euros
[09:59] you will keep your Euros if you keep it
[10:00] in a bank account or if you keep them
[10:02] hidden in your house somewhere but the
[10:04] value the purchasing power of those
[10:06] euros and of those dollars will
[10:08] drastically decrease and you'll be able
[10:10] to buy less and less over time so it's
[10:12] really foolish to just sit in dollars or
[10:14] sit in Euros or any government fiat
[10:16] currency over the long run that's
[10:18] interesting by the way the side that I
[10:20] pulled up uh it's the right side but I
[10:23] was on there for a minute I saw the
[10:25] chars and then it said ex is denied so I
[10:27] tried it in a different procow it did
[10:28] the same thing I don't know why I cannot
[10:31] access that chart but yeah maybe because
[10:34] I'm not in the US I don't know if if
[10:36] they have some weird rule that uh but
[10:38] yeah definitely uh the side if you want
[10:40] to check it out uh it was shortly in the
[10:42] video so you can uh go if they don't
[10:45] deny you the access it's should be the
[10:47] right side it's feels like the the the
[10:49] only real risk to bitcoin is a user
[10:51] error like if you uh if you lose your
[10:54] Bitcoin like that's the the biggest risk
[10:57] that that I see in in bit coin
[11:00] definitely I agree with that too we all
[11:02] know stories of people who especially in
[11:04] the early days right Bitcoin used to not
[11:06] be worth that much I I when I first got
[11:08] into Bitcoin um and started buying it it
[11:11] was about $500 per Bitcoin um so it was
[11:14] worth I thought I was late then by the
[11:16] way I I missed it it's it's already up
[11:18] to $500 um I know people you know I
[11:21] think Max Kaiser is a good example he
[11:23] was buying between like $1 and $5 for
[11:25] Bitcoin so a lot of people and people
[11:27] used to just give Bitcoin away there
[11:29] were Bitcoin faucets where you would
[11:31] just sign up and you would get free
[11:32] Bitcoin just for doing nothing and so
[11:34] people didn't take that kind of stuff
[11:36] very seriously so they would just
[11:37] collect it somewhere you know they maybe
[11:39] had 10 Bitcoin which was worth $10 or
[11:41] something uh and then they didn't take
[11:43] it very seriously so maybe they lost
[11:45] that device where they had the Bitcoin
[11:46] on or they didn't take it seriously
[11:48] about you know how to protect their
[11:49] Bitcoin or when they sent it they put
[11:51] the wrong address in and didn't really
[11:53] care because oh whatever I only lost 30
[11:55] Bitcoin who cares um right now that
[11:57] would be a fortune right and so so they
[11:59] make mistakes so people now I think are
[12:01] seeing um and learning from people in
[12:04] the past and past mistakes is you need
[12:05] to be really careful with how you store
[12:08] your Bitcoin um you need to be careful
[12:10] to not leave it on exchanges in any
[12:12] large amount because that can get you
[12:14] know fished away from you or something
[12:15] can happen to The Exchange and you can
[12:17] lose it all or if you send it to the
[12:18] wrong address there's no customer
[12:20] service number to call it's gone and so
[12:22] you got to make sure you're sending it
[12:24] to the right place um it's pretty easy
[12:26] to do these days with cut and paste uh
[12:28] and there are methods to make sure
[12:29] you're you're you're doing things
[12:31] correctly um but yeah you have to be
[12:33] extremely careful and that's what older
[12:35] people have a harder time with with
[12:36] Bitcoin is they think they can call the
[12:38] customer service department and and help
[12:40] and that'll help them recover their lost
[12:42] Bitcoin but that's just not how it works
[12:44] one on a% and I made some videos around
[12:46] that I even had Rick uh I don't know if
[12:48] you know him Rick Masset who lost the 25
[12:51] Bitcoins uh famously on the show explain
[12:55] what he did wrong because he had self
[12:56] custody he knew it he was not that old
[13:00] all those things but he still lost it I
[13:02] think it was a wake up call for for a
[13:03] lot of people um you mentioned uh being
[13:06] late and I I hear that all the time
[13:08] especially now because we're over 100k
[13:10] and I feel like people from the outside
[13:12] that don't really understand Bitcoin
[13:14] they always see those Milestones as a
[13:18] natural top they're like looking at
[13:20] 10,000 they're like okay now it topped
[13:22] out and it it reached its potential
[13:24] 100,000 it reached uh potential there um
[13:28] what do you say to people that say oh
[13:30] I'm too late or do do you have a number
[13:33] where you're like okay at that point you
[13:35] you might be actually a little bit late
[13:37] to bitcoin it depends on your time frame
[13:39] so if you have a long enough time frame
[13:41] and I say greater basically three years
[13:43] or more uh and why do I most people say
[13:46] four years but I like to use three years
[13:48] because it generally takes about three
[13:50] years for the the current liquidity
[13:53] cycle Peak when we have this big wave
[13:55] and the price goes exponential uh for a
[13:57] year which I expect to happen 2025 like
[14:00] happened in 2021 and 2017 and 2013 and
[14:03] even 2011 um it takes about three years
[14:06] usually to get back to that Peak price
[14:09] so it will be a painful three years if
[14:11] you buy at the peak right like I still
[14:13] remember people buying at the 2017 Peak
[14:15] it was about 20,000 or 18,000 right
[14:17] around that range people were foming in
[14:20] and putting all this money they finally
[14:21] believe in Bitcoin and they put all
[14:23] their money into Bitcoin and then they
[14:24] had a very painful three years while
[14:26] they waited while they watched the price
[14:28] go from 20 all the way down to 3,000 and
[14:30] then it took years and years and I think
[14:32] it was about December of 2020 until the
[14:36] price finally get got back above or to
[14:38] that 20,000 level again and then we got
[14:40] the news that I think Tesla was buying
[14:42] Bitcoin and then it spiked in early
[14:44] January and started popping off um if
[14:48] you have a time Horizon of at least
[14:50] three years or you can say four to five
[14:51] years I tell people you should have a
[14:53] 10year minimum time frame to just buy
[14:55] and hold I tell everybody the exact same
[14:56] advice all my friends family don't don't
[14:59] look at the price just buy Bitcoin
[15:01] dollar cost average into Bitcoin or
[15:02] anytime you get an influx of cash or a
[15:04] paycheck just buy Bitcoin whatever the
[15:07] price is because I can basically
[15:09] guarantee that 10 years from now it will
[15:11] be a lot higher than it is right now and
[15:13] if you start dollar cost averaging now
[15:14] even if you pick the perfect worst
[15:16] timing if you get the absolute tippy top
[15:19] of the 2025 Peak and maybe you get my
[15:22] thing of 475,000 or maybe it's a million
[15:24] dollars if you if you are unlucky enough
[15:27] to get that exact top um first of all
[15:30] it's a badge of honor to buy the peak I
[15:32] think just you know I like to try to buy
[15:34] Peaks too Michael sailor talks about
[15:35] buying the peak and I just think we're
[15:37] going to be buying the Peaks forever
[15:38] because it just keeps going up um you
[15:40] may have though if you ape in right at
[15:42] the peak you're going to have three
[15:43] painful years while it drops way down 70
[15:46] or 80% or so and then starts to creep
[15:48] higher again and then you'll be
[15:50] justified three to four years later um
[15:52] but I tell people like don't worry about
[15:54] that price have a 10year Time Horizon so
[15:56] if you're starting today you're watching
[15:58] this video this is going to be released
[16:00] on Christmas if you're looking if it's
[16:02] Christmas 2024 say okay I'm going to put
[16:04] my head down I'm going to stack SATs
[16:07] whenever you know whenever I can I'm in
[16:08] a dollar cost average into it and I'm G
[16:10] to do it for 10 years so I'm not going
[16:11] to look at the price until 2034 and I
[16:15] tell people if you do that and they
[16:16] think I'm kidding but I'm not I used to
[16:18] be an investment adviser I used to work
[16:20] with people's retirement accounts
[16:21] everybody does this at least in the US
[16:23] with their retirement accounts they
[16:24] think I got to just stack you know
[16:26] stocks and bonds and whatever nonsense
[16:29] for 30 to 40 years and then hopefully
[16:31] I'll get to retire at the end I tell
[16:33] people with Bitcoin because of its
[16:35] incredible annualized rate of return if
[16:37] you just do this as hard as you can for
[16:39] 10 years it will change your life you're
[16:41] going to look up it'll be Christmas of
[16:43] 2034 you'll be like oh my goodness I
[16:46] have optionality now I I could possibly
[16:48] quit my job right now I could retire I
[16:50] could go do I could go be an artist
[16:52] instead of being a starving artist you
[16:54] could be supported by Bitcoin uh you
[16:56] know there's all these things you can do
[16:58] now because you'll have way more
[16:59] financial freedom but you have to
[17:01] actually do that what usually happens I
[17:03] will tell you is right about now in this
[17:05] cycle part of the bull market people
[17:07] start reaching out to me again they know
[17:08] I'm the crazy Bitcoin guy right we all
[17:10] have everybody thinks of us as the crazy
[17:12] Bitcoin person it's exactly how it was
[17:14] in the 1990s with the internet everybody
[17:15] had a crazy internet person that thought
[17:17] internet was going to change the world
[17:19] um so it's the crazy Bitcoin person and
[17:21] they'll all reach out and what and and
[17:22] I'll tell them this exact same advice
[17:24] don't look at the price just buy it for
[17:26] 10 years but what everybody does is they
[17:29] ape into it right you know somewhere in
[17:31] the bull market and then it drops 70%
[17:34] and then they panic and they sell
[17:36] everything at the bottom I literally
[17:37] have friends and family members who sold
[17:40] Bitcoin when it was like $20,000 and
[17:43] $18,000 back uh just in the last bare
[17:46] Market in 2022 and I'm just like don't
[17:48] do that that's exactly what you're not
[17:50] supposed to do right you know you're
[17:52] supposed to buy low and sell high and
[17:53] you did exactly the opposite of that and
[17:55] so anyways I digress because I've been
[17:58] sort of emo scarred from this from lots
[18:00] of friends and family members over the
[18:01] years but I just I just can't emphasize
[18:04] enough how critical it is to quit doing
[18:07] that to quit making trades based on your
[18:09] emotion Bitcoin is the world's greatest
[18:12] savings technology that the world has
[18:14] ever seen the biggest opportunity cost
[18:17] in the world in the and I I mean this in
[18:19] the history of humanity there is no
[18:21] greater opportunity cost than to not own
[18:24] Bitcoin over the long run and so please
[18:27] start using it as your saving
[18:29] technology buy it hold it and quit
[18:32] trying to be a Trader and quit trying to
[18:34] be your hero and if you do that for 10
[18:36] years it will change your life that's
[18:37] that's sort of my my personal guarantee
[18:39] to people I love that message because I
[18:42] had so many people reach out to the 100K
[18:44] not so many but good amount of people
[18:46] reach out to uh around 100K even like at
[18:49] 90k 85k said like oh yeah I sold 20% of
[18:54] them and they had like oh like I I want
[18:56] to buy lower back lower because I'm not
[18:58] uh satisfied with my Bitcoin stack and
[19:00] I'm like yeah good luck because maybe it
[19:03] never goes back down to that levels like
[19:05] we don't know where it goes down it has
[19:08] a correction but we don't know if the
[19:10] correction goes back down to uh 50k or
[19:13] maybe it goes down to 150k or 200k we
[19:16] don't know that uh that's that that's
[19:18] super interesting another interesting
[19:19] thing is the retirement topic I just
[19:21] know that uh retirement is a super
[19:24] popular topic uh within the Bitcoin
[19:26] community community just because every
[19:29] time I put retirement in the title it
[19:30] just clicked more so that's kind of
[19:32] where I I see data of like okay those
[19:35] words those topics seem to be more
[19:36] popular and a lot of people also ask me
[19:39] like okay if I want to retire on bitcoin
[19:42] and want that strategy like what I have
[19:44] to do and I think that 10 year time
[19:46] Horizon is a really good one because 10
[19:49] years is kind of hard to not be really
[19:53] successful in Bitcoin when you have like
[19:56] a a middle class job you're like an
[19:58] average person
[19:59] and you can set aside a little bit every
[20:01] month uh it's really hard to not be
[20:03] successful with a 10year DCA strategy
[20:06] when you don't get distracted by higher
[20:08] prices or feeded out at lower prices
[20:11] both happen a lot I like that uh
[20:13] retirement strategy of like putting your
[20:15] hat down 10 years fooling for it um do
[20:18] do you have some some framework around
[20:21] retirement of like okay that that that
[20:23] you can look look at like that Bitcoin
[20:26] stack you have to reach obviously it
[20:29] depends on the personal situation but do
[20:31] do you have some framing around that so
[20:33] yeah so that's a really important point
[20:35] and everybody says that and it's not
[20:36] just because we're hedging uh or you
[20:39] know or being you know intentionally
[20:41] vague it's because it really is
[20:42] different for everybody right it's if
[20:44] you live in in the Midwest of the United
[20:47] States on a small town that's super
[20:49] cheap and a dirt cheap house and you and
[20:50] you're a single person um your cost of
[20:53] living is very very low if you live in
[20:55] Manhattan and you have a family of you
[20:57] know four kids and a wife um your cost
[21:00] of living is extremely high and it's
[21:02] like that all we can all figure out
[21:04] examples all around the world so it does
[21:06] very extremely with people um I also
[21:09] will say that it also depends on how
[21:11] serious you take this so if people put
[21:14] one% of their paycheck uh each paycheck
[21:17] and dollar cost average over 10 years
[21:19] they're gonna they're going to have
[21:21] success after 10 years but it might not
[21:23] be as incredible as you think versus if
[21:25] you put say 10% of your paycheck or 20%
[21:27] I tell people people think I'm crazy I
[21:30] tell people you should learn to live off
[21:31] of um uh 60 or 70% of your take-home pay
[21:35] and put the other 30 to 40% into Bitcoin
[21:39] and or other Investments if you want to
[21:41] right stocks and other kind of things
[21:42] but I think Bitcoin is the primary thing
[21:44] so what I tell even my own kids and
[21:46] we're Christians so I say okay you give
[21:48] the first 10% back to God you learn to
[21:50] live off the other 60 uh 60% and then
[21:53] that other 30% you just put in Bitcoin
[21:55] and you don't think about it and and and
[21:57] live off that and what you're doing is
[21:58] you're paying your future self so you
[22:00] pay yourself second pay God first pay
[22:03] yourself second and then you live off
[22:04] the rest of that and if you can just
[22:06] develop those habits over time and as
[22:08] your salary increases slowly over time
[22:11] because your skill level increases and
[22:13] your station increases um that 60% will
[22:16] become a meaningful amount but that 30%
[22:18] that you're saving and getting serious
[22:20] about saving will have a massive impact
[22:22] on your future self and you'll be in a a
[22:24] spot of financial optionality um much
[22:27] earlier than your peers if you do
[22:29] something like that so that's what I
[22:30] tell people um get serious about it you
[22:33] can dip your toes in the water like even
[22:35] when I first started it was with teeny
[22:37] tiny little amounts that I would buy
[22:39] Bitcoin with uh um and then I gambled in
[22:41] crypto proof of State crypto nonsense I
[22:43] got attracted by all that back in 2016
[22:46] 2017 which was like the dumbest thing
[22:47] I've ever done learned a lot from it I
[22:49] became a hardcore bitcoiner after that
[22:51] in 2018 2019 um and so I I tell
[22:54] everybody to just avoid avoid the shiny
[22:57] objects avoid uh all these other things
[22:59] you see because they have nothing
[23:00] relevant to do at all with Bitcoin and
[23:02] they're not here to stay Bitcoin is
[23:04] built to last these things are not built
[23:05] to last they have nothing to do with
[23:07] Bitcoin um anyways that's a whole side
[23:10] subject but I just tell people the more
[23:12] serious you take this and the more
[23:13] diligence you have in performing this um
[23:16] the better you will your outcome will be
[23:19] and the quicker your good outcome will
[23:21] be but you have to take it seriously for
[23:23] a good chunk of time yeah it feels like
[23:25] the early bitcoiners went through that
[23:28] uh altcoin and shitcoin phase but I
[23:31] honestly see a lot of bitcoiners that
[23:33] come into 2023 and 2024 into Bitcoin
[23:37] they usually don't have that altcoin
[23:39] phas it's really fascinating maybe we
[23:41] come to a point where the educational
[23:43] material the the podcast the books the
[23:46] the speakers everything around that is
[23:48] now at a level where when someone
[23:51] researched that it's really clear that
[23:53] Bitcoin is not crypto and Bitcoin is
[23:55] kind of the uh something completely
[23:57] different and you you really want to be
[23:59] here uh maybe we come to a point where
[24:02] we kind of uh not distracted away from
[24:06] from altcoins and shiny objects it's
[24:08] almost like uh micro strategy and other
[24:10] things are now distracting from Bitcoin
[24:12] self custody but it's still Bitcoin so
[24:14] it's not distracting from Bitcoin itself
[24:16] uh yeah it's it's it's really
[24:17] interesting uh time to be in in the
[24:20] Bitcoin cycle I hope we can continue I
[24:22] hope that's not just a subjective
[24:23] feeling with my Bitcoin bubble I hope so
[24:26] but I got to tell you that the one huge
[24:28] downside of the incoming Administration
[24:31] in the United States with Trump and um
[24:34] the the people who are coming on board
[24:36] they are pro crypto not just Pro Bitcoin
[24:39] I I'm concerned that we're gonna have a
[24:42] whole another huge crypto circus and rug
[24:46] pole cycle again unfortunately uh I mean
[24:49] Trump has his own coin right I they have
[24:51] their own meme coins it's just nonsense
[24:54] but I think to your point we've been
[24:56] working very hard as Educators in the
[24:58] space to
[24:59] distinguish proof of work Bitcoin is
[25:02] decentralized secure neutral energy
[25:05] money for the world it's this open-
[25:07] Source money for the world it's a better
[25:10] money for a better world proof of State
[25:12] crypto they they used to talk about that
[25:14] right ethereum used to talk about being
[25:16] ultrasound money you'll notice you don't
[25:19] ever hear people talking about that
[25:20] again I think it's because vitalic
[25:22] buterin was like I don't want to be the
[25:24] CEO of something that says that it's
[25:26] ultrasound money as a compe competitor
[25:28] to the dollar they will the Department
[25:31] of Justice will rain down on them and
[25:33] you know and and they the US dollar
[25:35] system does not like competitors the
[25:37] thing that's amazing about Bitcoin is it
[25:39] can't be stopped it's a Sly roundabout
[25:41] way around the US dollar all of these
[25:43] proof of State crypto currencies are
[25:46] just these goofy things that are they'll
[25:49] they'll there's no possible way there's
[25:51] a literally a zero% chance that they
[25:53] will become money for the world right
[25:56] they they're not designed to be like
[25:57] that they're just they're they're
[25:59] they're jokes they're they're meant to
[26:01] be gambled on and speculated upon and
[26:03] you can do little things with some of
[26:04] them that may have value over time like
[26:07] maybe putting um stocks on a blockchain
[26:09] so that you can trade stocks 247 uh 365
[26:13] all around the world that's a legitimate
[26:15] use case I think uh and I could see that
[26:17] taking off you know I think stable coins
[26:19] have a legitimate use case to me the
[26:20] stable coin system is just basically the
[26:23] euro dollar system that's expanding
[26:25] throughout the world because people
[26:26] desperately want access to better
[26:27] currency than their their government
[26:30] currencies uh the US dollar is clearly
[26:33] the best us is clearly the best fiat
[26:36] currency in the world uh relative to
[26:38] other government Fiat currencies is how
[26:40] I look at it and so that's why there's
[26:41] such a huge um draw and enticement for
[26:45] these stable coins so anyways that's a
[26:47] whole different subject but none of
[26:48] those things are vying with Bitcoin to
[26:50] be the world's decentralized secure
[26:53] neutral energy money for the world it's
[26:55] like the invention is so profound it's
[26:57] like the inv vention of the internet or
[26:59] like the invention of electricity or the
[27:01] internal combustion engine it's it's
[27:03] this incredible new technology that's
[27:05] going to totally reshape the world and
[27:07] put the world on a different path um so
[27:09] proof of State crypto does not offer
[27:11] that that's only for speculative
[27:13] nonsense I I put it that way uh altcoins
[27:16] will only survive if they comply and
[27:19] work with the government uh um
[27:23] operations uh stable coins they will
[27:26] only be allowed if the government is in
[27:28] stable coins and Al the stock market
[27:30] will only be long-term successful if the
[27:32] government and the and all those
[27:34] institutions say yeah we want it 24/7 to
[27:37] be reachable and they can beond there uh
[27:40] and that's kind of how I look at that
[27:42] and I'm like I don't want to be involved
[27:44] with that yeah exactly and who would
[27:47] right I mean even if even if you do have
[27:49] access to it that's great but especially
[27:51] for Europeans and Americans and most
[27:52] western Nations it it it's it's just
[27:55] still the dollar right even though it's
[27:57] a digital dollar it's it's still
[27:59] guaranteed to lose purchasing power over
[28:01] time with these stable quite options
[28:03] they're similar to cbdcs so they so I
[28:05] could see the government sort of
[28:06] marketing them as yeah we're not doing
[28:08] cbdcs we're doing this stable coin over
[28:11] here they're still programmable there's
[28:13] still there there's still a way to um
[28:16] invade your privacy uh there's they're
[28:18] still not permissionless like Bitcoin is
[28:20] there's all of the downsides of the of
[28:23] government fiat currency is in those
[28:24] stable coins um uh so anyways we're
[28:27] we're sort of digressing here but I just
[28:29] think they have nothing relevant to do
[28:30] with Bitcoin Bitcoin is better money in
[28:32] every way than these other options um so
[28:35] I just tell people and I know you do too
[28:37] like just quit wasting your time with
[28:40] those things you're You're Gonna Get
[28:41] Wrecked at some point it's just not
[28:42] worth it just stack Bitcoin stack it
[28:45] hard for 10 years and it will change
[28:47] your life over that 10 year time period
[28:49] absolutely be focused and one other
[28:51] thing that you said it was really
[28:52] interesting with with Trump in the new
[28:55] Administration uh we had Trump uh on on
[28:58] bitcoin Nashville it was saying crypto
[29:00] crypto crypto have fun playing with your
[29:03] Bitcoin that was kind of the the popular
[29:05] things then we had Eric Trump actually
[29:07] in Abu Dhabi uh um speaking I didn't uh
[29:10] saw the speech on the main stage I only
[29:11] saw the speech that he gave uh in the in
[29:14] the veil uh um area and basically he
[29:18] said mostly crypto not Bitcoin he said
[29:22] blockchain is an exciting technology all
[29:24] those things so like typical altcoin
[29:26] crypto things that he she said um how do
[29:29] you look at the general thing of trump
[29:32] getting into office being pro crypto Pro
[29:35] Bitcoin um many made the argument that
[29:38] CA Harris might have been a better
[29:41] choice even for Bitcoin because she
[29:42] brings more chaos in and and and maybe
[29:45] harder rules to crypto yeah and not only
[29:48] kamla but um Gary Gensler uh he was I
[29:51] think pretty he was okay for Bitcoin and
[29:54] he was very anti- proof ofst State
[29:56] crypto uh and I kind of like it honestly
[29:58] I the the crypto Community hated him um
[30:02] but but from a Bitcoin perspective I was
[30:04] like yeah he's he's kind of um he sees
[30:06] the difference between the two for sure
[30:08] um so there there are pros and cons
[30:11] right I think that this this
[30:13] speculative um nature of this cycle
[30:16] because of the Trump Administration and
[30:19] because of their Pro crypto stances I I
[30:21] I thought we might see the death of
[30:23] proof of State crypto because of Gary
[30:25] Gensler and the last Administration um I
[30:28] was wrong that was probably my major
[30:30] thing I got wrong I I was right that the
[30:33] SEC brought about a ton of lawsuits
[30:35] against proof of stake ex you know
[30:37] crypto exchanges and the currencies
[30:39] themselves and they lost they got
[30:41] smacked down by the courts I was
[30:43] surprised by that I thought they would
[30:44] be more effective I thought we might not
[30:46] see another crypto cycle um but I I I
[30:50] just I've gone 180 on that now now that
[30:52] Trump is on board and now that we have a
[30:54] pro not just Pro Bitcoin but also a pro
[30:56] crypto uh Administration it's going to
[30:59] be a circus I think and and so uh I
[31:01] think we are going to see people get
[31:03] distracted and they're going to be like
[31:04] well that's great I can maybe you know
[31:06] 5x my money in in Bitcoin this year but
[31:10] what if I 20 xed it because I bought
[31:13] this dogcoin or bought you know whatever
[31:15] goofy coin of the day is popular
[31:18] um I don't know it's very frustrating to
[31:21] me but but again okay so I'll say one
[31:23] more thing I'm a I'm a I'm a Libertarian
[31:26] I believe I'm a freedom Max
[31:28] above all if people want to speculate in
[31:30] garbage and do that kind of stuff go for
[31:33] it it's your life you do what you want
[31:35] right as long as you're not harming
[31:37] other people uh that's kind of my take I
[31:39] say speculate in whatever you want but
[31:41] make sure to save in Bitcoin um as long
[31:44] as people in their minds and this to me
[31:45] is the most important thing is as kind
[31:47] of an educator in the space as long as
[31:49] people understand that proof of State
[31:51] crypto has nothing relevant to do with
[31:53] proof of work Bitcoin that's fine uh you
[31:56] can invest in stocks bonds gold
[32:00] cryptocurrencies whatever you know Meme
[32:03] stocks fine um but just understand that
[32:06] you're speculating and you can go to
[32:08] zero doing that but the only way to
[32:10] truly save is to build uh your Satoshi
[32:12] stack right to save and Bitcoin that's
[32:14] how you truly save for a better tomorrow
[32:16] for yourself and your family I partnered

[34:37] and especially Austria but I think whole
[34:39] Europe is is the same ways uh everyone
[34:42] in the mainstream media says covers
[34:45] Bitcoin the same way yeah Bitcoin hit
[34:47] now 100K in Euros 100K in dollars uh and
[34:51] it's because Trump got elected and it's
[34:53] so frustrating because it gives they
[34:55] give Bitcoin like one minute air time on
[34:58] the like nonfinancial things and they
[35:01] just say like oh price rips and Trump is
[35:04] the reason for that uh first of all is
[35:06] that in America the same way and uh more
[35:10] more interesting do you think Trump
[35:12] actually has something to do with that
[35:14] priz r or would have that happened
[35:17] probably anyways or maybe later or
[35:19] something like that how do you look at
[35:20] that well like I said uh a year and two
[35:23] years ago I was saying that the price of
[35:25] Bitcoin I thought would be between 100
[35:26] and 125 ,000 by Christmas of 2024 and
[35:30] here we are and I think what happens is
[35:32] people most people don't understand how
[35:35] the financial world really works they
[35:37] don't understand macro and so they think
[35:38] it's all Voodoo they think you can't
[35:41] predict what's going to happen with
[35:42] asset prices you can't predict what the
[35:45] Federal Reserve is going to do with uh
[35:47] rate cuts and and things like that um
[35:50] but turns out you can and it turns out
[35:53] what most people want is narratives to
[35:55] explain what's going on and so
[35:58] and and then on top of it it's not
[36:00] helping because Trump actually takes
[36:02] credit for the price of Bitcoin pumping
[36:04] right and this is what he did last time
[36:05] he took credit for the stock market
[36:07] every time the stock market would go
[36:09] higher he'd be like I did this thank me
[36:11] if yeah he's very narcissistic he's
[36:13] incredibly narcissistic um love him or
[36:15] hate him he's very narcissistic he's
[36:17] very entertaining too uh and so um I
[36:20] think we're going to see a lot of that
[36:22] especially in 2025 and then what you'll
[36:24] notice though so say we get a bare
[36:26] Market because of liquidity conditions
[36:28] around the world and a pivoting a peing
[36:30] economic cycle that then rolls over and
[36:32] starts to go in the wrong direction um
[36:35] at that point if that happens we're
[36:36] going to see another bare Market in
[36:38] stocks and especially in Bitcoin and
[36:40] especially in proof of State crypto so
[36:42] people are going to lose 99 to 100% of
[36:45] their gains uh if they don't you know
[36:47] take take profits um but what will what
[36:50] will be absent and I can predict this
[36:52] with a lot of confidence is Trump will
[36:53] not take credit for that he will not say
[36:56] I'm the reason Bitcoin is dropping I'm
[36:57] the reason the economy is turning South
[37:00] I'm the reason that crypto is is getting
[37:02] is getting uh you know getting crushed
[37:04] right now by 90 to 100% he doesn't take
[37:06] credit on the down on the downsides he
[37:08] only takes credit on the upsides will'll
[37:11] be fun in 2026 to to to see that
[37:13] happening if if that happens um uh in
[37:16] 2021 we had also an interesting uh cycle
[37:19] because I feel like the cycle top was
[37:22] kind of suppressed by by China musk uh
[37:26] pumping and then dumping it again uh and
[37:29] and some some smaller other factors like
[37:32] FDX and and and things like that um and
[37:35] a lot of people uh I heard that many
[37:39] times now where okay we got a suppressed
[37:41] 2021 and it probably could have reached
[37:44] 100K even in 2021 but it didn't and now
[37:48] maybe the next top will overcorrect and
[37:51] will like shoot out of the Moon uh in in
[37:55] in that saying um is that something that
[37:58] you're you're looking at that the this
[38:00] next cycle will be completely crazy as
[38:03] it seems to be there's no real negative
[38:05] news like the government is on top and
[38:08] stuff like that yeah so that's generally
[38:10] my take as well is that um I I just what
[38:13] you said I think 2021 was an anomaly I
[38:16] think that the the ban from China of
[38:19] banning all Bitcoin miners was a real
[38:21] true Black Swan event for the Bitcoin
[38:24] Network it's hard to beat down the
[38:25] Bitcoin network but it did the hash rate
[38:27] dropped 50% in a month that was
[38:29] incredible um and and all of those
[38:31] miners it used to be centered the
[38:33] Bitcoin mining used to be centered in
[38:35] China um and then they banned it and
[38:37] then all of those miners had to quickly
[38:38] sell all of their Bitcoin so they
[38:40] flooded the market um it drove the price
[38:43] lower much lower um and that was right
[38:45] in the heart of the bull market uh and
[38:47] so Bitcoin made an effort to to try to
[38:50] get back up uh to a new Peak and it did
[38:52] it reached a new high of about
[38:54] 69,000 um but I think it would have been
[38:56] much higher if that China event would
[38:58] have uh would not have happened and then
[39:00] second because as you say FTX and these
[39:02] other exchanges were hoodwinking people
[39:04] into thinking they were buying Bitcoin
[39:05] but they actually weren't um so that was
[39:07] a price suppressant as well um I do so
[39:11] because of that and because I think 2021
[39:14] was an anomaly I do not think I don't
[39:17] believe in the diminished cycle Peak
[39:20] Theory um that is very prominent and is
[39:22] catching on I think that's the general
[39:24] belief is that that's real there are a
[39:26] lot of prominent people speak of that so
[39:28] because of that they think the next high
[39:30] will be somewhere in the 150 to 250,000
[39:32] range um we'll see maybe they're right
[39:35] um I don't think so and that's what I've
[39:37] been saying again to your point that if
[39:40] there are any surprises this cycle it
[39:41] will be a surprise to the upside um so I
[39:44] think that um with the way everything is
[39:46] going and given that I think it was a
[39:48] fluke last time I think it's very
[39:50] reasonable to think we get above 300,000
[39:53] 475 like I said I and like I said at the
[39:55] beginning I wouldn't be surprised if we
[39:57] actually touch a million dollars per
[39:59] Bitcoin in this cycle I don't think it's
[40:01] likely I want to make that very clear
[40:02] I'm not predicting a million dollars I
[40:04] think there's maybe like a one or two
[40:06] percent chance it gets that high but it
[40:08] could it could get that high barring
[40:10] anything and and for me the most
[40:12] important thing I look at is what is the
[40:14] business cycle doing and what is the
[40:15] liquidity cycle doing because those are
[40:17] actually what Drive the prices of stocks
[40:20] and especially of Bitcoin Bitcoin is the
[40:22] great absorber of liquidity and so if
[40:24] liquidity is flush and really screaming
[40:26] into the system
[40:27] a couple things it could actually extend
[40:29] this cycle so it doesn't necessarily
[40:31] have to end at the end of 2025 you know
[40:34] there's no there's no magic rule that
[40:35] says you have to keep doing these
[40:37] perfect fouryear Cycles it could go into
[40:39] 2026 it could go into 2028 um that
[40:42] that's another thing from a macro
[40:44] perspective I still think and I've been
[40:46] saying this for a couple years that the
[40:48] current conditions are most similar to
[40:50] the mid1 1990s in the mid 1990s the
[40:53] Federal Reserve had the the FED funds
[40:54] rate high they started to lower the Fed
[40:57] funds rate and then they actually went
[40:59] back up again uh and then what happened
[41:01] is the problem with the late 1990s is
[41:04] the economy was so strong um that the
[41:07] Fed was actually trying to slow it down
[41:09] a bit towards the end but we didn't have
[41:11] a recession that everybody thought we
[41:13] were going to have they had a scare with
[41:14] the long um long-term capital crisis and
[41:19] the Asian financial markets crisis was
[41:20] about 1998 or so but then the we were
[41:24] flooded with more liquidity and we had
[41:26] that huge blowoff top in the stocks in
[41:30] from basically 1998 to 2000 nobody could
[41:33] believe it it was just incredible it
[41:34] just kept going higher and higher
[41:36] everybody was shorting it everybody who
[41:38] was shorting it got their faces ripped
[41:40] off uh it was very difficult time for
[41:42] people so I actually think if there ever
[41:44] were a time where it's possible to have
[41:46] that current setup again it's right now
[41:49] um people are still calling for a
[41:50] recession they were calling for it in
[41:52] 2023 they were calling for it in 2024
[41:55] they're still calling for it in 25 and I
[41:58] think they're completely wrong I call
[41:59] them the recessionista they've been
[42:01] wrong for two years and they're going to
[42:02] be wrong for three years um and I think
[42:05] with the progrowth policies that are
[42:07] coming on board with where we are in the
[42:09] early stages of a of a recovering
[42:12] economic cycle which is where we are
[42:13] right now here in the US and then even
[42:16] with so Europe is as you know Europe is
[42:19] really struggling right now with stag
[42:20] inflation and China is really struggling
[42:22] with station what that means to me is
[42:25] that Europe and China are going to lead
[42:26] the away with liquidity at some point
[42:29] and it will be basically once the US
[42:31] dollar breaks lower when the because the
[42:34] dollar has been screaming higher for the
[42:36] last two and a half months at some point
[42:38] the dollar will break similar to what
[42:40] happened back in 20 late 2016 early 2017
[42:44] ironically the last time Trump was
[42:46] elected um the dollar spiked into the
[42:48] end of the year and then it was it
[42:50] weakened for all of 2017 I think we're
[42:52] going to have exactly the same thing
[42:54] this time around as well almost exactly
[42:57] and I think we're going to get a flood
[42:58] of liquidity once that happens from
[43:00] China from the European Union and that
[43:03] is going to provide the stimulus that's
[43:05] going to help prop Propel the price of
[43:07] Bitcoin much higher and possibly
[43:10] elongate this business cycle uh it in
[43:13] comparison to past Cycles uh what what
[43:16] what do you mean with business cycle and
[43:17] liquidity cycle I never heard those
[43:19] words oh okay so yeah they're twoo so
[43:21] they different things so so the way that
[43:24] um well so so now we're getting deep
[43:26] into the weeds with macro so so
[43:27] basically what happens is back in 2008
[43:31] this the the Federal Reserve took
[43:33] control of the markets from just the
[43:36] from the free market economy that we
[43:38] kind of had back then it was it was part
[43:40] partially centrally controlled it became
[43:42] totally centrally controlled uh after
[43:44] 2008 the crisis they just flooded the
[43:47] markets with liquidity right so
[43:48] quantitative easing happened so what
[43:50] they said is what we're going to do is
[43:52] we're going to take all of the
[43:54] treasuries off of the market and we're
[43:56] going to we're going to uh strongly
[43:59] encourage the institutional investors
[44:02] the big Banks uh investment Banks things
[44:04] like that and then even retail investors
[44:06] to move further out on the risk curve so
[44:09] instead of just buying treasuries and
[44:11] and sitting in cash we're going to force
[44:13] you to go further out on the risk curve
[44:15] to buy stocks and risk assets which like
[44:18] we talked about earlier so Bitcoin is
[44:20] considered a risk asset by lots of
[44:22] Market participants even though we
[44:23] consider it as the world's safest
[44:25] asset and when they do that that causes
[44:28] this big push in prices
[44:30] higher that usually precedes the
[44:33] business cycle of an economy by about 12
[44:36] months or so so first what we see is
[44:39] this flood of liquidity and then the the
[44:42] economic cycle bottoms and then starts
[44:44] to turn higher so basically you can see
[44:46] that through PMI so what is the
[44:47] manufacturing sector of a country doing
[44:50] what is the services sector doing that
[44:52] starts to turn higher so in the United
[44:54] States even though lots of prominent
[44:55] people are calling for a recession
[44:57] actually we're at the early stages of
[44:59] recovery and if you look at things like
[45:01] new orders and expectations um they are
[45:04] shooting higher right now so I expect
[45:06] 2025 to show the economic cycle to start
[45:09] increasing we're going to see economic
[45:11] growth so GDP acceleration and inflation
[45:16] acceleration but not in a a scary
[45:18] terrible way like it was back in 2022
[45:21] we're going to see just a kind of a
[45:22] little bit higher Trend when you have
[45:25] increasing economic growth and
[45:27] accelerating low levels of inflation and
[45:30] uh central banks that are supplying
[45:32] liquidity
[45:33] also that is very good for risk assets
[45:36] so that's why I look at 2025 and I look
[45:38] ahead for the full year and I don't see
[45:41] anything barring a Black Swan event I
[45:43] don't see anything really stopping that
[45:45] cycle I think in general we're going to
[45:47] see growth and we're going to see a
[45:49] mildly increased inflation and we're
[45:51] going to see generally supportive
[45:53] central banks we're going to see very
[45:55] supportive central banks in the Europe
[45:57] and in China even because they have more
[45:59] stagflationary conditions so they're
[46:02] going to try to Spruce to to juice the
[46:04] markets as much as they can by doing
[46:07] things like quantitative easing and
[46:08] loosening Financial conditions as much
[46:10] as they can and all of that stuff
[46:13] eventually flows into risk assets and
[46:15] eventually flows into Bitcoin does that
[46:17] make sense yeah it makes a lot of sense
[46:19] it's also interesting uh as you said
[46:21] before with the blowoff top that we had
[46:23] in the internet uh cycle n 2000 with the
[46:27] do com bubble uh and I really like those
[46:29] comparisons between the internet
[46:32] adoption and Bitcoin adoption
[46:33] unfortunately we didn't had an internet
[46:35] token that was underlying everything and
[46:37] showing the price of of it that's really
[46:40] interesting to have in in Bitcoin
[46:41] because you kind of can track the all
[46:44] the things of course you can track how
[46:46] did Microsoft Amazon or or apple do in
[46:49] those times and you kind of have an idea
[46:52] uh but you you you can also imagine so
[46:55] so you're saying that that plof top the
[46:58] same bubble thing you C could imagine in
[47:01] the Bitcoin scene um uh for the next
[47:04] years would that then also mean that we
[47:06] have that massive drop down and maybe
[47:09] that's the the vanishing point of of
[47:11] those cryptos then also so that's the
[47:13] kind of stuff I watch for so what I will
[47:15] be concerned about is when so if we have
[47:18] I expect the economy especially based in
[47:20] the US and then the United States pulls
[47:22] the other um major economies along So
[47:25] eventually the EU and eventually China
[47:28] and even Japan will start to also do
[47:31] better from an economic perspective
[47:33] they'll lag the us but they'll get
[47:34] pulled out of the mud and start to
[47:37] perform better what I expect to see is
[47:39] that the economy especially with Trump
[47:41] related policies right he's all about
[47:43] just juicing the economy and if he has a
[47:46] a senate and a house that are on his
[47:48] side at least for the first two years
[47:50] they will juice the economy they'll do
[47:52] everything they can to make it run very
[47:54] hot and he doesn't care he doesn't care
[47:56] about the fact that we have to pay the
[47:58] piper later he just wants it to be
[47:59] Juiced while he's in office so what I'll
[48:03] be watching for is at some point if the
[48:05] economy gets overheated if GDP growth is
[48:09] kind of off the charts stocks are at
[48:12] historic all I believe they I believe
[48:14] they will be historically expensive they
[48:16] already are expensive they're going to
[48:17] get even more expensive over the next
[48:20] year or more um so what happens then is
[48:24] central banks then they say look the
[48:26] econom is getting too hot we need to do
[48:28] things to slow that down um we're going
[48:31] to see inflation starting to run hot as
[48:33] well uh a and everything to get very
[48:36] very overpriced the housing market to
[48:38] get overpriced it's very bad for people
[48:40] who don't own assets right we talk about
[48:43] I talk about a lot the owner class and
[48:44] the renter class the owner class has
[48:47] been doing awesome since 2009 ever since
[48:50] this this whole stimulative Central Bank
[48:53] uh cohesive effort um when they do that
[48:56] b basically if you own any assets you do
[48:58] very very well if you're the renter
[49:00] class the only thing that happens is
[49:02] life gets more and more expensive and
[49:04] you have to work more and more jobs just
[49:05] to pay your bills uh to buy groceries
[49:08] and to have a car and things like that
[49:09] it's tragic uh and it's terrible income
[49:12] inequality and that's directly related
[49:14] to the fiat currency system and the
[49:15] Keynesian economic system it's what it's
[49:18] the expansion of credit uh and so if
[49:20] you're borrowing money you get crushed
[49:22] by the expansion of credit but if you
[49:24] own assets you benefit from the expans
[49:26] expansion of credit but that's another
[49:28] different subject too so so what I'll be
[49:30] watching for is somewhere maybe at the
[49:32] end of 2025 once uh the the Federal
[49:36] Reserve starts saying things like the
[49:38] economy is getting overheated we need to
[49:40] slow things down they at that point
[49:43] they'll talk about raising the federal
[49:44] funds rate because when you raise rates
[49:46] it makes those short-term interest rates
[49:48] more expensive um so small business
[49:50] owners who have um variable rate debt um
[49:54] Americans with helocs home equity lines
[49:56] of credit those kind of thing those are
[49:58] variable rate debts that's directly tied
[50:01] to the federal funds rate so the federal
[50:03] funds rate as that increases that means
[50:05] it gets more expensive for them to pay
[50:07] their debt off um and so that's the
[50:10] that's one of the tools they use to kind
[50:12] of help slow down the economy they would
[50:14] also do more quantitative tightening
[50:16] which is actually what the FED is doing
[50:17] right now they're they're letting
[50:19] balances roll off of their uh they're
[50:21] they're letting assets like treasuries
[50:24] and mortgage back Securities roll off of
[50:26] their balance sheet they're not buying
[50:28] them actively on the open market um
[50:30] that's considered quantitative
[50:31] tightening so I would expect more of
[50:33] that first first I think we're going to
[50:34] see them expanded again in 2025 but at
[50:37] some point when things get overheated
[50:38] they'll they'll switch that again and
[50:40] they'll start letting those assets roll
[50:41] off again and when they let those assets
[50:43] roll off that tells people to move back
[50:46] on the risk curve to more it forces
[50:48] Banks and institutional investors and
[50:50] things to buy treasuries instead of to
[50:52] be further out on the risk curve so it's
[50:55] kind of confusing but that's those are
[50:57] the kind of things as a hedge fund
[50:58] manager that I follow very closely as I
[51:00] look what is the econ what's the
[51:02] economic cycle doing what is the
[51:04] liquidity cycle doing are the central
[51:06] banks now starting to talk about slowing
[51:08] down the economy if they do that and if
[51:10] they succeed that's usually when we see
[51:13] kind of a deflationary bust and we see
[51:15] these major recessions happen um where
[51:18] we are today Christmas
[51:20] 2024 none of those things are in place
[51:23] right now it's the exact opposite things
[51:24] are looking good the business cycle has
[51:26] bottomed and it's starting to look
[51:28] better I think central banks are going
[51:30] to be more supportive of markets I think
[51:32] it's very bullish for risk assets and
[51:34] it's extremely bullish for Bitcoin in
[51:36] for the next 12 months or so I'm I'm
[51:38] wondering all the time like when when
[51:40] the public will no longer see Bitcoin as
[51:42] a risk asset probably uh when Bitcoin
[51:45] gets boring and uh it it kind of has no
[51:47] volatility any any anymore but yeah I I
[51:52] do agree with you basically what you
[51:54] said before it was amazing that
[51:56] diminishing returns I don't buy it
[51:58] either like that that doesn't make sense
[52:01] from any standpoint when you see Bitcoin
[52:04] and I think most people cannot
[52:06] comprehend the mind around that asset
[52:08] being actually uh kept at 21 million I
[52:11] think that's like it's digital it's
[52:13] globally available it's the 21 million
[52:14] it it you cannot make more of it even if
[52:17] everyone wants it and 8 billion people
[52:19] have an incentive to join that network
[52:21] uh that that's just uh really really big
[52:24] um you touched on it a little bit
[52:27] um what happens when Bitcoin and I want
[52:30] to shift a little bit of gear what
[52:32] happens when Bitcoin actually gets uh to
[52:35] a mass market and and it really triggers
[52:38] in the the whole uh market and everyone
[52:42] kind of gets it more and more so not we
[52:45] have like very small asset now what if
[52:47] we have 50% 60% have a direct exposure
[52:51] or indirect exposure to bitcoin what
[52:53] will be the impact of of Bitcoin on
[52:56] Society on on the world on the financial
[52:58] markets well first of all I think it's
[53:00] inevitable I think that it absolutely is
[53:02] going to take over the world and become
[53:05] ubiquitous when I say take over I don't
[53:07] mean that in an ominous way I mean like
[53:08] the way the internet has taken over the
[53:10] world and become ubiquitous and now the
[53:12] internet is basically everywhere same as
[53:15] electricity people used to not have
[53:16] electricity now most of the world has
[53:18] their houses and their businesses
[53:20] electrified uh you have access to
[53:22] electricity it's a technology like that
[53:24] most people still don't understand that
[53:26] they very confused by that but that's
[53:27] what is what it is it's a it's a
[53:29] superior monetary technology that is
[53:32] starting out small and then it will
[53:34] follow that s-shaped curve of adoption
[53:37] um which by the way is the same thing as
[53:39] a power law scale so it's it's following
[53:41] that adoptive growth where we're just
[53:43] going to see more and more people
[53:45] continue to use it and adopt it and the
[53:47] way it works is you can think about this
[53:50] with your own life and I I like to use
[53:51] my example when I first got into Bitcoin
[53:54] I went from zero to about 25% exposure
[53:58] because I was still kind of trying to
[53:59] figure out what this thing was and then
[54:01] I went to like 1% exposure and then it
[54:03] grew and then it crashed and all this
[54:05] kind of stuff and then and then the more
[54:07] you understand it and I and you see this
[54:09] I see this with bitcoiners all over the
[54:11] world they get more and more comfortable
[54:13] with it they get more and more um
[54:15] comfortable with the inevitability of
[54:17] Bitcoin over time and they put more and
[54:20] more of their life savings into it they
[54:23] transfer their purchasing power from the
[54:25] Fiat Network to the Bitcoin Network and
[54:27] they start to live on a Bitcoin standard
[54:29] and now I know lots of people who are
[54:31] just completely on a Bitcoin standard
[54:33] they're out of the Fiat system as much
[54:34] as possible one one great tool I'm sure
[54:36] you heard about is is Jack MERS with
[54:38] strike they have this bill pay feature
[54:40] that's at least available in the United
[54:42] States now you literally get your
[54:43] paycheck directly put into uh it goes to
[54:46] strike it gets instantly converted into
[54:48] Bitcoin and then you you you can put all
[54:50] of your bill payment um uh data in and
[54:53] then it just whenever a bill comes due
[54:55] it it instantly converts that Bitcoin
[54:57] back to Dollars quickly instantly uh and
[54:59] then pays those bills so you can live on
[55:02] a Bitcoin standard effectively um what
[55:05] does that mean as more of the world
[55:07] starts to do this and as the world
[55:08] transition to a Bitcoin standard I think
[55:11] it's going to be awesome and I and I I
[55:13] don't speak in hyperbole I get very
[55:16] emotional and excited but I don't speak
[55:18] in hyperbole I try to say things that I
[55:20] think are accurate and
[55:22] true I think that life on a Bitcoin
[55:25] standard I think we're we're at a a
[55:27] pivotal point in humanity like we were
[55:30] 500 years ago with the invention of the
[55:33] printing press and the the whole
[55:35] industrial Renaissance and Revolution uh
[55:38] all of that changed humanity and
[55:40] Humanity pivoted from kind of the Dark
[55:42] Ages to moving to the cities to do
[55:44] factories to railroads and cars and
[55:46] airplan everything we've seen in the
[55:48] last 500 years was a was a defined pivot
[55:52] um I think we're at another pivot point
[55:55] in humanity where transitioning from the
[55:58] um analog world to the digital age uh
[56:01] and obviously the internet is what is
[56:03] helping to uh in in personal computers
[56:05] and all that kind of stuff and AI is all
[56:07] a part of that and Bitcoin is now the
[56:10] money for this new world of humanity
[56:13] what it does because fiat currency you
[56:16] can just basically say what does fiat
[56:17] currency incentivize it incentivizes
[56:21] short-term Behavior because it loses its
[56:23] purchasing power quickly you want to get
[56:25] rid of it as quickly as as possible and
[56:27] speculate in other things it creates
[56:29] desperation in people people are anxious
[56:33] uh they're depressed there's you know
[56:35] massive opioid abuse in the United
[56:37] States their suicide rate is is spiking
[56:40] especially among my age of people who
[56:42] are just giving giving up on life um
[56:44] killing themselves because they don't
[56:46] have hope for the future people they
[56:48] feel like they're hamsters on a
[56:50] treadmill working harder and harder and
[56:52] harder and harder and they can't pay
[56:54] their bills and so it puts them in a
[56:55] desperate situation desperate people do
[56:58] desperate things so they do things like
[57:00] buy meme stocks and crypto tokens called
[57:03] fcoin and whatever dumb dogcoin whatever
[57:06] thing is the popular coin for the day
[57:08] because they're desperate they just want
[57:10] anything to give them a lottery ticket
[57:12] so they can get out of this hell hole
[57:14] that they're in this terrible position
[57:16] that they're in all of that is because
[57:19] of this fiat currency system this income
[57:21] inequality that's reached Epic
[57:23] Proportions is because of the fiat
[57:25] currency system and the credit based
[57:27] system the whole deal like if you are an
[57:30] owner owner class you're doing well if
[57:32] you're in the renter class you're
[57:33] struggling to survive um Bitcoin closes
[57:37] that Gap because it's a proof of work
[57:39] system it basically is a different world
[57:41] where if you're willing to put the work
[57:43] in you're willing to save and to spend
[57:46] less than you make and save the rest in
[57:49] this proof of work uh decentralized
[57:52] secure neutral energy money called
[57:54] Bitcoin you will do well over time and
[57:57] it it's a different world if you can
[57:59] start looking uh instead of in the short
[58:01] term like I got to you know I got to
[58:03] figure out how to speculate to to earn a
[58:05] little bit more purchasing power this
[58:07] month if you can look five 10 years 50
[58:10] years a 100 years out into the future
[58:12] you can build a much better world doing
[58:15] that you can do things I call it the age
[58:17] of Legends so I think we are at the cusp
[58:19] of the age of Legends where um artists
[58:22] will be celebrated if you can do things
[58:24] like I live in a neighborhood where we
[58:26] have track houses right where every
[58:28] house looks the same and they're all
[58:29] made with cheap construction
[58:31] material you can go back to kind of like
[58:33] Italy in the in the 1500s and build
[58:36] beautiful structures you can take 50
[58:39] years to build something beautiful you
[58:40] can go explore space if you want to you
[58:43] can do amazing things because you have
[58:45] this confidence of your purchasing power
[58:48] is going to hold into the future and you
[58:50] have enough purchasing power for
[58:51] yourself and for your kids and for your
[58:54] grandkids or maybe you're you know at a
[58:56] church and you can you can you can think
[58:58] about missions for the next 100 years
[59:00] without getting concerned um all of
[59:03] these kind of things they they just
[59:05] changed the mindset and it really is I
[59:07] think that the world a 100 years from
[59:09] now is not going to look anything like
[59:11] the world does today or like it did a
[59:13] hundred years ago it's going to be
[59:15] almost a complete shift for Humanity
[59:18] into this new digital age and into this
[59:20] new age of Legend So I'm personally very
[59:22] excited about it I think the people who
[59:25] are not excited about it are people who
[59:27] benefit off of the proof of stake system
[59:29] so govern so huge governments and
[59:32] government officials will not like the
[59:33] new world the new Bitcoin standard World
[59:36] um people who are dependent on the
[59:38] government uh who you know people who
[59:40] don't like to um do proof of work who
[59:43] who want to just somehow know the right
[59:45] people or you know um do something in
[59:48] order to get free money um those people
[59:51] won't like the new system it's going to
[59:52] be a very different world so um there
[59:54] there will be winners and losers losers
[59:56] though not everybody wins um but but I
[59:58] think it's a better world for most of
[60:00] humanity and I'm very excited about um
[60:02] seeing the progress over the next 10 and
[60:04] 20 years I love that a lot and and you
[60:07] also in in the beginning you said
[60:09] something really interesting with like
[60:11] you have to pay God first and and then
[60:13] yourself a second and then you pay the
[60:15] rest of the builds uh and I know there
[60:18] are a lot of people that make a
[60:19] connection from Bitcoin to God uh
[60:22] there's like uh the go uh God blast
[60:25] Bitcoin and uh movement in the book and
[60:27] the other books uh around that topic uh
[60:31] do do you also see kind of an an similar
[60:34] connection there or how do you address
[60:36] that topic you know I have funny
[60:38] feelings about that as a Christian it it
[60:40] I think here's what really bothers me is
[60:42] I see people who actually worship
[60:45] Bitcoin and they I I at first it seems
[60:47] like a joke but many people have I've
[60:50] had private conversations with them they
[60:51] literally view Bitcoin as God and
[60:54] worship Bitcoin and I look back as a as
[60:57] a person who spent my life you know
[60:59] reading the Bible and looking at history
[61:01] I think it's so amazing to me that
[61:03] people used to worship idols and they
[61:04] used to um treat these things these gold
[61:07] statues as God um to me that's just
[61:10] incredible um but and I know that people
[61:12] think I'm crazy personally just for
[61:14] believing in God in the first place but
[61:15] that's that's a whole different uh
[61:16] subject um but when I see
[61:19] people worshiping Bitcoin as God I get
[61:22] very concerned that's not what it it's a
[61:24] tool it's an invention it's incredible
[61:26] and it's going to change the world um
[61:29] but it's not it's not a God to be
[61:30] worshiped that's how that's how I look
[61:32] at it I get a little um uneasy in fact
[61:34] I've been I'm in those videos the God
[61:36] bless Bitcoin video and things like that
[61:39] um
[61:41] it it doesn't sit right with me in a lot
[61:44] of ways I don't think it was handed down
[61:46] by God either I I think it was just the
[61:49] progress of humanity and an amazing
[61:51] invention and and we should celebrate
[61:53] that and that's awesome um and it's and
[61:56] as a Christian what I like about it is
[61:58] that it's fair and honest money that's
[62:00] kind of my main thing and I used to
[62:02] speak at the thank God for Bitcoin
[62:03] conference and things like that and
[62:04] support that because I think that if God
[62:07] were to have a money for his people he
[62:09] would want it to be fair and honest
[62:11] money that doesn't take advantage of
[62:13] other people that you don't have the
[62:15] cantelon effect where if you know the
[62:17] right politicians or know you know JP
[62:19] Morgan or you know Jamie Diamond
[62:21] personally um you have more access to
[62:23] the money printer um that's unfair and
[62:27] it's unjust but Bitcoin is a much fair
[62:29] because it's an open source neutral
[62:32] energy money everyone can see the
[62:34] transactions it's a fair unit of account
[62:36] for the world to me that is a more Godly
[62:39] form of money it's I I Christians should
[62:41] be super excited about it anyone who has
[62:44] moral values should love Bitcoin because
[62:46] it's a fair money so that's kind of the
[62:49] extent I think about it as a Christian
[62:52] um it's the most sort of moral and the
[62:54] most ethical form of money for the world
[62:55] world and I think that will incentivize
[62:57] a much more moral and ethical world in
[63:00] the age to come yeah it's also
[63:02] interesting how like first of all I I
[63:05] totally agree with you that Bitcoin is
[63:06] is a tool it's money uh but but it's
[63:09] interesting how people first make it
[63:13] religious and second put their values on
[63:16] top of Bitcoin accept and then expect
[63:18] that every Bitcoin has to be the same
[63:20] way uh it it it is done with the
[63:23] carnival diet it's done with all the
[63:24] other things and those are great things
[63:26] like uh don't get me wrong but uh it's
[63:28] like uh just because you are a Bitcoin
[63:30] and you protect that values onto Bitcoin
[63:33] and it's because it's such a big thing
[63:35] in your life doesn't mean that every
[63:37] Bitcoin has to be like that and there's
[63:40] a lot of things like that right it's
[63:42] just a new to you use the word tool it's
[63:44] just a tool it you can use it for good
[63:46] or bad right you can take a hammer and
[63:48] you can pound a nail with it or you can
[63:49] kill a person with it it doesn't make
[63:51] that hammer good or bad it's just a
[63:53] neutral tool and so I I look at Bitcoin
[63:56] is exactly the same it's just this
[63:57] neutral uh inanimate Tool uh anyways we
[64:01] don't have to keep talking about that
[64:02] but yeah people make too much of it I
[64:04] think uh even though I think the
[64:06] implications of this new invention are
[64:09] profound for the world um got to be
[64:11] careful how much you put into it 100% uh
[64:16] one topic that I wanted to get discuss
[64:18] already earlier but I really want to get
[64:19] it in the podcast because uh we are
[64:21] connected on on Primal on Nostra I I
[64:25] just use primal I don't even know if
[64:26] you're using Primal um and you switched
[64:29] off Twitter right I think completely I
[64:33] think you the account that you had
[64:34] before is not even findable anymore um
[64:37] so you use only Nostra what did motivate
[64:41] you to go to that step and also what
[64:43] kind of challenges did you see right now
[64:45] yeah so good question um you know I I
[64:49] look at Noster first of all it's it's in
[64:51] its early days so for people who don't
[64:53] know it's basically kind of and I'm not
[64:55] a technical person at all so it's hard
[64:57] for me to um explain it correctly but
[64:59] it's basically a new social media
[65:02] protocol it's an open- Source protocol
[65:04] for the world and you can build
[65:05] different clients on top of that to
[65:08] access that protocol and so one of we
[65:10] both use Primal I've also used damus or
[65:13] damus as another one there are many the
[65:15] amethyst is another one there's several
[65:16] different uh clients that you can use on
[65:18] top of it in order to access it and it
[65:21] it feels kind of like Twitter um it has
[65:23] sort of an you know an Instagram or
[65:25] Facebook feel as well but it's mostly
[65:27] has kind of a a Twitter feel that's
[65:30] because of the applications that are
[65:31] built on top of it or the clients built
[65:33] on top of it you can make it feel kind
[65:35] of how you want it to feel depending on
[65:37] the developers um what I like about it
[65:39] is because it's open source what that
[65:41] means is you control your identity and
[65:45] your information so when you sign up for
[65:47] Twitter or Facebook Instagram Tik Tok
[65:50] you know anything else those are
[65:53] centralized agencies that they get your
[65:56] demographic information and then they
[65:58] control the algorithms as well so their
[66:01] goal is to get you to use their
[66:03] application yeah there it is um so yeah
[66:06] that's that's my profile if you guys
[66:07] want to find me it's Dr Jeff primal. net
[66:10] um it feels and looks a lot like Twitter
[66:14] um but the the the huge difference is
[66:17] Twitter does not own my information I
[66:19] don't have to do anything in order to um
[66:23] to uh you know to stay on their plat
[66:25] form I was um pretty actively involved
[66:28] on Twitter I had like
[66:30] 98,000 followers or something like that
[66:33] um before I nuked it and what one of the
[66:35] benefits of that was I would post things
[66:37] and based on the amount of uh
[66:39] interaction I would get with my post I
[66:41] would get paid every two weeks so pter
[66:43] Twitter pays its influencers that's a
[66:46] that was a nice feature right I would
[66:47] just take that and buy SATs with it uh
[66:49] and it was it was pretty neat but it
[66:51] incentivizes you all of this
[66:53] incentivizes Twitter and the other
[66:55] social media platforms to get their
[66:58] users as locked in as possible so the
[67:00] algorithms get you to you know spend as
[67:03] much time as possible I noticed
[67:05] personally that I was getting it was it
[67:06] was before the presidential election so
[67:08] I was getting extremely stressed out
[67:10] right like you hear these really wild
[67:12] stories and the most crazy stories that
[67:15] evoke the most emotions tend to get the
[67:17] most uh Impressions uh and that's just
[67:20] it's by Design and so you know I was
[67:23] listening to Jack dorsy talk about it
[67:25] some of the conferences he was like it's
[67:27] basically social worldwide mind control
[67:31] and that sounds kind of crazy to talk
[67:32] about but these people literally control
[67:34] the algorithms of what you see and what
[67:36] you don't see um we you know we we live
[67:39] through the covid time period and you
[67:41] know and I'm a doctor and if you happen
[67:42] to say anything that contradicted the
[67:45] government Narrative of vaccines and you
[67:48] know social distancing and all that kind
[67:49] if you questioned it you were
[67:51] deplatformed they would literally shut
[67:52] you off and shut you down and I'm like
[67:55] that's really terrible right you know as
[67:57] a scientist if you can't question the
[68:00] science openly without without
[68:02] repercussions without threats of
[68:03] violence without shutting down getting
[68:05] shut down and and cut off that's not
[68:08] science that's propaganda at that point
[68:10] and so what I like about this is this is
[68:12] basically free speech so in the same way
[68:15] that Bitcoin is open source value uh for
[68:18] the world or just an open source money
[68:19] for the world I think of Nostra as open-
[68:22] Source free speech for the world you
[68:24] control the narrative you control the
[68:26] algorithm um it's definitely clunky
[68:28] right so if you come over and want to
[68:29] try it and I suggest everybody do it but
[68:31] I think everybody should have just like
[68:32] everybody should own Bitcoin I think
[68:34] everybody should try Noster at least get
[68:35] a profile on Noster and start to start
[68:38] to use it the experience is not as good
[68:41] as Twitter or x uh as it was but it's
[68:44] getting better rapidly so it's early
[68:46] days but getting better Primal as you
[68:48] mentioned we're both on Primal they just
[68:49] came out with Primal 2.0 a much better
[68:51] experience uh it's it's it's pretty
[68:53] smooth um it's still kind of harder to
[68:56] navigate than Twitter um they still
[68:58] don't have spaces yet they have
[69:00] equivalents but they're sort of hard to
[69:02] get to things like Noster nests uh and
[69:05] other things are like Twitter spaces but
[69:07] you don't see them as easily they're
[69:09] harder to access um there are downsides
[69:11] to that but they're building on that and
[69:13] I think they will be um better and
[69:14] better o over the coming years so it's
[69:16] fun to be a part of this new movement
[69:19] what kills me is I'm not a developer I
[69:21] don't know how to code I have nothing to
[69:23] contribute of value and so I just kind
[69:26] of complain about oh I wish we had this
[69:27] and it would be nice if we had this
[69:28] feature and things like that but there
[69:30] are true people who are open source
[69:32] developers who are putting in the work
[69:33] and then one last thing I'll say that's
[69:35] just amazing about Noster and and I
[69:37] didn't think about it that much until I
[69:39] actually got on and started doing it
[69:42] every Noster client has or you can you
[69:45] can find ways to do this you have
[69:46] basically a Bitcoin hot wallet attached
[69:49] to your account so what instead of just
[69:51] liking tweets or or liking a post or
[69:54] loving it or giving a thumbs up whatever
[69:56] you actually can give people Satoshi so
[69:59] if you like a post instead of just
[70:00] giving them a thumbs up you can actually
[70:02] um zap somebody is the term you can zap
[70:04] somebody a thousand sets or 10,000 sets
[70:06] or a whole Bitcoin if you want to you
[70:07] can do whatever you want so so there's a
[70:10] there's a different ethos over on Noster
[70:12] of a value for Value if if I provide a
[70:15] Val valuable content in a post that I
[70:17] post or say Robin you post you um you
[70:20] put up a a new interview with somebody
[70:22] who's fantastic what I do if I see that
[70:25] and I like that and I derive value from
[70:27] it I can zap you and basically give you
[70:29] a tip of Satoshi um that goes just right
[70:31] into your account instantly nobody can
[70:33] stop it it's permissionless and that's
[70:35] incredible and so what it does instead
[70:37] of fostering this thing where like
[70:40] Twitter does where it encourages
[70:41] influencers to just basically say the
[70:43] most crazy outlandish thing in order to
[70:46] generate more Impressions now you have
[70:48] to actually provide value and if you
[70:50] provide value you're rewarded for that
[70:52] through actual Bitcoin which is an
[70:54] amazing feature I think and so anyways
[70:57] my my last thing is everybody should get
[70:59] an oser account even if it's clunky to
[71:00] use now it's getting better rapidly and
[71:03] I think it will eventually replace all
[71:05] of these centralized social medias that
[71:06] we're currently used to absolutely and I
[71:09] can also recommend uh Prim let a it's a
[71:11] great place I had damos uh a year ago uh
[71:15] like one and a half years ago I think
[71:17] almost two years ago now uh time flies
[71:20] by uh and I turn it on I had it for a
[71:23] week and then I was like Ah that's too
[71:25] close FY I I don't want to get a Mor
[71:26] with that then I tried this year Primal
[71:30] and it was really good like I I really
[71:32] like the experience then I was like that
[71:34] that's way better that that develop from
[71:37] development like one on two years uh in
[71:40] between that was way way way better also
[71:43] got today actually the Primal OG badge I
[71:46] was like ah okay 20 20 $20 I will take
[71:51] that if bra gets really big I'd have
[71:54] that uh bad that I was in in
[71:57] 2024 there and I also saw you you got it
[72:01] but yeah it's it's a a neat thing also
[72:04] one thing that I want to add uh as a as
[72:06] a podcaster you distribute your podcast
[72:09] everywhere like you I'm on Spotify I'm
[72:11] on Apple podcast I'm on Fountain I'm on
[72:15] Twitter Youtube like literally
[72:17] everywhere you can uh listen to a
[72:19] podcast or long form video I am there
[72:22] and you get comments everywhere like
[72:25] people comment on Spotify people com on
[72:26] YouTube and it's really like I have to
[72:29] check so many apps if I really want to
[72:31] get to every comment um and now on
[72:34] Fountain uh I my podcast is also and the
[72:38] fountain is automatically an nostr also
[72:40] because they now have um integration of
[72:43] Nostra with Fountain uh which is was my
[72:47] first real big oh nice moment for for um
[72:52] for Nostra because now if someone
[72:55] comments on uh Nostra I can reply to
[72:58] that and that's automatic on Primal also
[73:02] and so that's it's a little bit like you
[73:04] get a reply on YouTube you reply to it
[73:07] then later you log on Twitter some he
[73:09] replied back to your reply and you can
[73:12] continue the conversation on Twitter
[73:14] which uh I know I don't know if if
[73:17] anyone agrees with that but I think
[73:19] that's the single best feature about
[73:21] Nostra that's the the the best for me as
[73:23] a content creator because I just have to
[73:25] put out one thing and I upload now my
[73:28] video on five different platforms so I
[73:31] have to upload the same thing with the
[73:33] same title same description same thing
[73:36] five times next to each other it's a
[73:38] it's a real clunky thing and that's why
[73:40] I have the best internet connection that
[73:42] I got in my region um and it's really
[73:45] nice to have Nostra that that that could
[73:49] be and I hope that could be the next
[73:52] mainstream thing where everyone is on
[73:53] there but it's a long way is still still
[73:56] still go there yeah y yeah you might I
[73:59] don't know if you do that already but
[74:01] have you heard of Zap stream I heard
[74:03] about it but I didn't use it till now
[74:05] yeah so you can actually it's like
[74:07] YouTube you can create video content and
[74:09] post it and it does the same thing
[74:10] because it's on this whole open source
[74:12] protocol it goes across all these other
[74:14] different clients and you can use it and
[74:16] then you can get zapped in real time or
[74:18] if people come and watch you later they
[74:19] can actually send zaps to you for the
[74:21] for the production which is kind of kind
[74:23] of neat so it's a just a different
[74:25] instead of the advertising model and The
[74:27] Impressions model uh that most social
[74:29] media platforms currently use um where
[74:32] you're beholden to the advertisers you
[74:34] just if you put out good content people
[74:35] will send you Bitcoin for it and and I
[74:37] to me that's a more pure way of doing it
[74:39] and it's more of a value for Value kind
[74:41] of um Arrangement and I think it's it's
[74:44] great really cool absolutely I I agree
[74:46] with that um one question that each and
[74:48] every one of my guests get is what can
[74:51] we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[74:55] um well you know I'm old I've been
[74:57] around the block so I've done I think
[74:59] kind of a lot of things um I liked it's
[75:03] it it's sort of funny but every once in
[75:05] a while I get kind of sick of talking
[75:06] about Bitcoin and macro because it's
[75:08] basically all I talk about um but I like
[75:10] a lot of other things too right I really
[75:12] like um like I used to want to be a
[75:14] counselor um back in the day so I love
[75:17] to sort of counsel people um and have
[75:19] like authentic relationships with people
[75:21] it's hard to do that on social media um
[75:24] but that's something I really enjoy I'm
[75:25] a physician um and I do something called
[75:28] radiology and I used to be an
[75:29] Interventional radiologist which is sort
[75:31] of the surgery side of of of medicine
[75:34] and Radiology um I like talking about
[75:37] all that I love talking about the broken
[75:39] Health Care System uh uh it's very
[75:41] broken in America and all doctors
[75:44] understand that but we're not in charge
[75:45] so we can't change it the way we want it
[75:47] and that's very frustrating um similar
[75:49] to how the education system is broken to
[75:52] how the military is broken um I like
[75:55] talking about all of those kind of
[75:57] things I think what it gets down to me
[75:58] is I just love learning and I try to
[76:01] encourage people I say always be
[76:02] learning like I think if you are always
[76:04] learning you will succeed in life not it
[76:07] doesn't necessarily mean you'll be rich
[76:08] but you will have success you will enjoy
[76:11] uh life more uh you enjoy people more
[76:14] it's fun to get interested in what other
[76:16] people are doing um and so I would just
[76:19] encourage people to just learn about
[76:21] other stuff like get to know people and
[76:23] get to know what they're doing um and
[76:26] anytime anybody wants to talk to me
[76:27] about that like I don't have to talk
[76:28] about macro and Bitcoin I there's a lot
[76:31] of other things I like talking about so
[76:33] that's a very long answer to say uh it's
[76:36] you know I'm I'm interested in so many
[76:38] different things and I'm always happy to
[76:39] talk about other things if people want
[76:41] to reach out absolutely we we can do it
[76:44] on our second round and get some other
[76:45] topics in because we covered all all the
[76:48] basics right now really cool um we have
[76:50] an entertain in the podcast where the
[76:51] previous guest is asking a question for
[76:53] the next guest without knowing who the
[76:54] next guest actually is um it's an simple
[76:58] question uh have you ever seen a Bitcoin
[77:01] mining rig in real life oh oh yeah at
[77:05] conferences I've seen them I haven't
[77:06] seen them I've never been to
[77:09] um well so yeah I mean I've personally
[77:11] seen them I've seen individual ones uh
[77:14] in different spots I've never been to
[77:16] like a public minor to see you know a
[77:18] huge mining operation but yes i' I've
[77:21] definitely seen individual units um from
[77:25] different friends and acquaintances
[77:27] absolutely I don't want say too much but
[77:29] yes I've seen I've seen them yes yeah
[77:31] absolutely and yeah uh I I usually asked
[77:34] in the uh last part of the podcast where
[77:36] can people find you but I think we
[77:38] already covered that and also showed
[77:40] your profile so so people can find you
[77:42] on on Primal I guess that's also the
[77:43] best place to to find and reach out to
[77:45] you yep that is yeah that's actually the
[77:47] only place I am now i' I've Consolidated
[77:49] everything to just Noster and then you
[77:51] know I run a a friends and family hedge
[77:53] fund um as well it's called Bill share
[77:56] Partners so if people are interested in
[77:58] that it's it's um uh I'm not even
[78:00] looking for clients anymore I'm not
[78:01] looking for I'm not looking for patients
[78:03] I don't have an audience to grow I don't
[78:05] really care I just like kind of sharing
[78:07] what I know with people and if people
[78:08] have stuff they want to share in return
[78:10] that's that's great so I appreciate what
[78:11] you do Robin I mean you're educating the
[78:14] world about an amazing new technology um
[78:17] and uh and it takes a lot of time and
[78:19] effort to do what you do so thanks
