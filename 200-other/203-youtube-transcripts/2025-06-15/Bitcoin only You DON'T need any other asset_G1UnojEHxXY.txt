[00:00] is the Western World just too arrogant
[00:02] to understand Bitcoin when you
[00:04] understand that Bitcoin is made as a
[00:05] solution to to our monetary system you
[00:07] don't need the CH coins you don't is the
[00:08] feat system The Matrix everybody's
[00:10] controlled with the bank some people
[00:12] don't like change but you need to
[00:13] embrace change if the alternative is a
[00:16] disaster the world will be a better
[00:18] place with
[00:19] Bitcoin you made a podcast before that I
[00:21] listened to and it it was like the title
[00:23] something with the Fiat and the Matrix
[00:26] and how to escape the matrix so just the
[00:29] open question
[00:30] uh is the Fiat system The Matrix like
[00:33] the when we make the comparison to The
[00:36] Matrix the movie is is Fiat the The
[00:38] Matrix I would say it is I would say it
[00:41] is like every Everybody stuck in The
[00:43] Matrix and the fat system and like as
[00:46] soon as you start looking in like
[00:49] Bitcoin like you you start to find your
[00:51] way out it's so so cool like when you
[00:54] when you start to realize that and you
[00:55] can draw that that connection between
[00:58] like Matrix and and our Fiat world how
[01:01] deep are you still in The Matrix if I'm
[01:04] still in The Matrix how how deep are
[01:06] like I feel feel like everybody is still
[01:08] a little bit in there like everybody has
[01:10] some some some toes some some shoes in
[01:12] The Matrix uh even I use daily the Euro
[01:16] uh I get even paid from sponsors in in
[01:19] Euros sometimes and sometimes in in
[01:21] Bitcoin like the like even in the
[01:23] Bitcoin world even someone that does
[01:25] only Bitcoin podcast even now I have to
[01:27] have a bank account I have to have the
[01:29] Fiat systems so just a question like how
[01:31] deep are you still in Matrix and then I
[01:34] I guess I'm I'm pretty stuck in the in
[01:37] the Matrix then because I live in Sweden
[01:39] and Bitcoin in Sweden no it does not go
[01:42] hand inand so yeah I'm pretty deep stuck
[01:46] in in The Matrix unfortunately Sweden is
[01:49] also really strict with cash like they
[01:52] they are really cashless right I heard
[01:54] we are we are like everybody is
[01:57] controlled by with like the banks and
[01:59] like our bank
[02:00] accounts and it's crazy actually and we
[02:03] we do have the the oldest Central Bank
[02:05] in the world rck bankin H so I feel like
[02:09] we're going to be the last ones jumping
[02:11] on the Bitcoin train I'm pretty sure the
[02:14] last ones but I feel like Sweden is such
[02:17] an Innovative country also like it seems
[02:20] like there's a lot of uh Innovation
[02:22] coming then and then there's also the
[02:24] they handled Co I feel like uh really
[02:27] differently than everyone else uh but
[02:30] then in Bitcoin they cannot see like uh
[02:33] I I didn't want to go the Sweden route
[02:34] actually with the podcast but let's get
[02:36] a little bit in that like how do you see
[02:38] the Sweden in general is it good with
[02:40] the Innovation why are they not getting
[02:43] on on on bitcoin what do you see there I
[02:45] I would say that Sweden is pretty good
[02:47] with Innovation we we're good with like
[02:49] um the the technical things but when it
[02:52] comes to money uh like I feel like we're
[02:54] like laying beyond all the time but we
[02:56] also like look a lot at like how the us
[03:00] is handling things and like now with the
[03:03] f efts um and everything I feel like
[03:08] maybe something will start to happen in
[03:10] Sweden as well uh but I don't know like
[03:13] it works pretty slowly and it's so like
[03:16] when I talk about like the media for
[03:18] example in
[03:19] Sweden so don't even go there because
[03:22] the way that media like puts Bitcoin
[03:25] they want us to think that Bitcoin is
[03:28] for for criminals and it's so bad for
[03:30] the environment and like if that's the
[03:32] picture that Sweden is is showing the
[03:35] society like that's what people will
[03:37] start to think so when I talk to to like
[03:40] my friends about Bitcoin and especially
[03:43] when I started to do that they looked at
[03:45] me and was like are you criminal or
[03:47] what's going on like what are you buying
[03:49] with these
[03:51] Bitcoins and it's it's great but uh yeah
[03:55] I do feel like we're good in the
[03:58] Innovation part not with money though
[04:00] like you you can pay with
[04:03] Bitcoin anywhere in in in Sweden you
[04:07] can't H so that and I think also that
[04:10] has a lot to do with like our tax rules
[04:13] we have very regulated tax rules and I
[04:16] actually got the chance to sit down with
[04:18] like Sweden's tax agency and I asked
[04:21] them about this and like they they never
[04:25] like gave me a good answer h i i
[04:27] especially talked about like
[04:30] um like if a small like restaurant or
[04:34] headdress like a saloon wants to accept
[04:36] Bitcoin as a payment like they're scared
[04:39] to start because of the tax regulations
[04:42] and we're going to be like so beyond the
[04:44] other countries if we keep go keep going
[04:46] like this uh and they're like yeah send
[04:49] us an email we could look into this but
[04:53] I'm not going to get an answer so when
[04:56] whenever you hear my old job was in
[04:58] sales and whenever you hear like send us
[05:00] an email it's over it's like basically
[05:03] they know uh but it's it really
[05:04] interesting is is there like um I never
[05:07] looked into it but in Germany and
[05:08] Austria there are like few places where
[05:10] you can buy things with Bitcoin even
[05:12] like in restaurants even like sometimes
[05:14] in big restaurants uh you can buy with
[05:17] Bitcoin there's like the PTC map where
[05:19] you can see like where where are some uh
[05:21] things but it's it's rarely possible but
[05:24] there are restaurants like you could eat
[05:26] and drink and kind of survive in Austria
[05:30] with with only Bitcoin the only problem
[05:32] is Bitcoin is a taxable event so when
[05:35] you spend your Bitcoin you have to pay
[05:39] 27.5% in taxes when I'm not uh mistaken
[05:43] so that's the biggest hurdle but in
[05:44] Sweden it's not even possible or is are
[05:47] there some vendors uh well try to try to
[05:51] look up Sweden at the BTC map um we look
[05:55] like North Korea we honestly do like it
[05:58] is song places that they they say that
[06:01] that they accept Bitcoin I haven't
[06:03] looked it up I think it like it's like
[06:05] two cafes or something in Stockholm I
[06:07] know that it was one Cafe and I actually
[06:08] walked there and it just said closed so
[06:11] it was just closed uh like so I don't
[06:14] know like it's it's legal for for people
[06:18] to use it and like for for restaurants
[06:21] and store to use it as well
[06:23] but people don't like it and I think
[06:26] it's mostly because like the the Gap in
[06:28] in knowledge and touched on also on the
[06:30] mainstream media side and I feel like uh
[06:33] with with you with with Tik Tok what
[06:35] you're doing on Twitter and and all the
[06:37] the rest you're kind of representing a
[06:40] new form of media like that's different
[06:43] than the mainstream media where we have
[06:46] a mainstream media we have like these
[06:47] news outlets and these institutions that
[06:50] basically just hire a bunch of writers
[06:53] and write the things they want to see in
[06:55] the newspaper and now uh social media
[07:00] with nostr it's even better but with
[07:02] mainstream media mainstream social media
[07:06] uh we have individual gr who just talk
[07:09] their mind sometimes get deleted
[07:11] sometimes get banned but usually like
[07:14] they they talk their mind and they can
[07:15] actually provide independent information
[07:20] uh how do you see that shift like is is
[07:23] whole news media completely gone soon
[07:26] and then we have this individual
[07:28] greaters where are people more follow
[07:31] individual people independent content
[07:33] creators and and less just news Outlet
[07:37] uh or is the Twitter and the YouTube and
[07:40] the dicted the new news outlet that kind
[07:42] of control what the narrative is on the
[07:44] on the platform uh and do we have to go
[07:47] to Nostra and to the decentralized uh
[07:51] Medias like how do you see the media uh
[07:53] landscape and a chance for being a
[07:56] little bit more free um that's that's
[07:59] such a good question like I would say
[08:01] that I watch the news every day in
[08:04] Sweden like you can see like how
[08:08] censored it is uh because especially I
[08:11] I'm a lot on Twitter H so I get a lot of
[08:14] news on Twitter and I get a lot of news
[08:17] from from the television in Sweden and
[08:20] the difference is
[08:21] huge so like I prefer to getting my to
[08:25] get my news from like independent
[08:27] accounts because I I trust that more
[08:30] than I trust our media today um and I I
[08:34] think that's also the the reason that I
[08:37] started with like so I upload videos on
[08:40] on Tik Tok H and I started doing that in
[08:42] 20 2021 and that was especially because
[08:45] I saw like I was talking to like my
[08:47] friends uh when I when I found my way to
[08:50] bitcoin and I started talking to them
[08:52] about Bitcoin
[08:54] and like I when I saw like how how huge
[08:57] this knowledge Gap is I was like okay
[08:59] who's going to educate these people
[09:01] because the media will not and my
[09:05] friends they like they don't even use
[09:06] Twitter they use Instagram and maybe Tik
[09:10] Tok but they don't go on Twitter and and
[09:13] like get a knowledge of Bitcoin so I was
[09:14] like okay somebody somebody needs to
[09:16] fill this Gap and that's somebody well
[09:18] that had to be me so like I prefer I
[09:21] really prefer um like independent uh
[09:25] media I think but you should be like
[09:27] aware of what you listen to of course
[09:29] always uh be critic to everything how is
[09:33] it to create content on Twitter T Tik
[09:36] Tok especially because I also do my
[09:39] podcast my shorts I distribute them just
[09:41] everywhere so also on Tik Tok and um
[09:44] like every like two or three weeks I
[09:47] reinstall my Tik Tok app and see what
[09:50] comments I got and usually it's pretty
[09:54] pretty uh bad from the comments that I
[09:57] get like really uh big not Gap in
[10:00] YouTube and Twitter it's kind of mixed
[10:02] there are also like people that are
[10:04] really educated and have really nice
[10:06] impact like insights in the Bitcoin
[10:08] Community but there also there's where
[10:10] like there's a huge disconnect between
[10:13] uh what they know about Bitcoin and what
[10:15] they think they know about Bitcoin uh
[10:18] how do you like is it just because I
[10:20] have a new account there and and and not
[10:22] a lot of Bitcoin is found there or is it
[10:24] General tick Tok um I would say like
[10:28] indeed first of all uh it's it feels
[10:31] like I'm in two different communities
[10:33] because I now now I upload everything
[10:35] that I everything that I upload on on
[10:37] Tik Tok to I also upload on Twitter and
[10:40] the feedback that I got that I get from
[10:42] Twitter it's so much better than the
[10:45] feedback I got on on Tik Tok and I feel
[10:48] like uh on Tik Tok we reach the people
[10:52] that don't know anything about Bitcoin H
[10:55] and like I get a lot of more questions
[10:57] questions there and also like
[11:00] a lot a lot more conversations like not
[11:03] now because I don't know something
[11:05] happened to my algorithm so the videos
[11:06] aren't AR working that good uh but like
[11:10] people starts uh debating in my in my
[11:13] comments about Bitcoin and I'm not even
[11:16] in there like talk talk about like how
[11:18] Bitcoin is bad for the environment and
[11:20] everything and then somebody else comes
[11:21] in and they start arguing in my in my
[11:23] comments uh but Tik Tok it's more like
[11:26] for for I would say like especially for
[11:29] me for like the people that don't know
[11:31] anything about Bitcoin and when I upload
[11:33] something on Twitter it's everybody is
[11:35] so supportive for for
[11:38] everything uh but when when I started to
[11:40] upload videos on on Tik Tok I like I got
[11:44] pretty good feedback and I got a lot of
[11:46] views so I don't know how this for you
[11:51] yeah it's I had a previous like there's
[11:55] a few things going on because I had a
[11:56] previous Tik Tok account where I got
[11:59] like three and a three and a half
[12:00] thousand uh followers and then they were
[12:03] chairman and they were stock investors
[12:06] and then I left that account for like
[12:09] two three years and now I just push
[12:11] Bitcoin English content on there and I
[12:14] think the algor just does not know what
[12:16] to do with it uh and uh I like get the
[12:20] some followers and I lose some
[12:22] followers every day so like I'm like
[12:24] kind of stuck in the same thing but I
[12:26] really also don't care too much uh about
[12:29] Tik Tok should should I be more on Tik
[12:31] Tok is is should we should put more
[12:35] importance on on Tik Tok do you see is
[12:37] is it important to be on Tik Tok as
[12:39] bitcoiner um like I would say that we
[12:42] reach out to to like other people on Tik
[12:47] Tok we we we reach out to the younger
[12:49] generation like my generation and like
[12:52] we need the knowledge that we share on
[12:54] Twitter today but I don't know how it is
[12:56] in like Australia for example but my
[12:58] friends are not on Twitter so if I want
[13:00] to share my knowledge with them and like
[13:02] with with my
[13:04] Innovation then I need to be on Tik Tok
[13:07] because they don't use Twitter
[13:10] um so but but it's hard like for for
[13:13] example I uploaded so many videos and
[13:17] just last week I got on my account and I
[13:19] watched through it and it was so many
[13:21] videos that has been deleted because I I
[13:25] I think I think that Tik Tok is if I
[13:27] understood it correctly they they had
[13:30] some like kind of collaboration with
[13:33] Universal Music or something like that
[13:35] so they deleted so much music and when
[13:37] they deleted the music my video
[13:40] disappeared uh and I don't know it's
[13:43] this rumor also that uh Tik Tok is about
[13:45] to get banned or something in in the US
[13:48] I'm not that invested in in that I like
[13:51] Twitter more now
[13:52] so yeah take take Tik Tok off my
[13:56] shoulder that would be great
[14:00] yeah it's it's a fascinating platform as
[14:03] as I said like I'm I'm rarely on there
[14:05] I'm just checking uh if if some video
[14:08] event Ravel never never happened but I'm
[14:11] always checking like every second week
[14:13] but it's interesting but now let's get
[14:15] into my actual questions that I have for
[14:17] you this was kind of
[14:19] Sidetrack I wanted to start actually
[14:22] with why are you PTC chick and not
[14:25] crypto chick or something like
[14:27] that uh okay so I got that's a good
[14:30] question because because I got into to
[14:32] bitcoin from the economic way so I
[14:34] started to to study International
[14:36] political economy in
[14:38] 2021 like uh when I when I started to to
[14:42] to study that I guess that you already
[14:44] know that like the the education in like
[14:47] universities they're very focused on
[14:50] chanism so like that's what typically
[14:53] taught in in the University
[14:56] so I think that this e e economic
[14:59] Journey actually led me to a broader
[15:01] understanding of and eventually like the
[15:03] world of Bitcoin and its implications so
[15:06] uh I am a I'm a person that's always
[15:08] like I always ask myself why so I I feel
[15:13] like it was the inflation part that
[15:14] dragged me in Bitcoin so let's say for
[15:17] example ER spankin it's Sweden's Central
[15:20] Bank and as I already told you the the
[15:21] oldest bank uh the Central Bank in the
[15:24] world so they consider a 2% inflation
[15:27] rate as normal right that's what to keep
[15:29] this the economy moving and like I
[15:32] accepted this I I was taught this in in
[15:35] the university and I accepted it uh but
[15:38] like I couldn't let that go
[15:40] so I was like okay it makes sense but
[15:43] somehow I couldn't shake it off I was
[15:45] like okay 2% is inflation why 2% but
[15:47] also the statement that 2% inflation is
[15:50] normal like honestly how can inflation
[15:52] be normal is there's such a thing as
[15:54] normal inflation so I I honestly began
[15:57] researching like the two percent
[15:59] inflation thing and like the first time
[16:02] they seemed to make sense because I
[16:03] didn't know any better but then uh I
[16:06] talked about this in the other podcast
[16:08] as well I I Stumble up uh on on in
[16:12] because I was Googling this uh and I
[16:14] stumbl on up on inflation in Venezuela
[16:17] and I came across this photo I guess you
[16:19] seen it it's um of chicken and money
[16:23] have you seen that uh no check on money
[16:25] oh you have to Google it just if if you
[16:27] just Google inflation in Venezuela you
[16:29] will get a picture of a a chicken and
[16:32] cash and the cash weighs more than the
[16:34] chicken and I was like I I I read this
[16:37] article about Venezuela experiencing
[16:39] 880,000 per inflation so that's a huge
[16:42] different with from from like Sweden and
[16:44] we're like okay two 2% inflation is
[16:46] normal and then 80% and I I was like
[16:49] like where did this go wrong 80%
[16:51] inflation can't be normal
[16:54] and like asking myself why again I I
[16:58] came to the realiz
[16:59] that I don't think that I never truly
[17:02] understood inflation until then uh like
[17:05] whether it's 2% inflation or 8,000%
[17:08] inflation when our Central Bank decides
[17:11] to create money out of thin air the
[17:13] value of the money and our bank accounts
[17:15] decreas in value so the image of of the
[17:19] chicken and and money from Venezuela it
[17:21] wasn't about the chicken it was only
[17:23] like illustrating that the money had
[17:26] become completely worthless so
[17:29] well I I started questioning this and
[17:32] and also realizing like when you start
[17:34] questioning and like start to ask the
[17:36] question why it becomes clear that like
[17:39] the issue
[17:40] isn't the people it's the money and
[17:44] theoretically what happened in Venezuela
[17:46] can happen anywhere in the world so I
[17:49] guess I was like okay KES can you
[17:52] explain this to me and he like he
[17:54] couldn't explain that to me
[17:56] so I I had to like start searching for
[17:59] for other answers myself and uh and I
[18:03] think like I especially remember like my
[18:07] dad he's very into Tech so he had some
[18:10] knowledge about Bitcoin and I was
[18:12] sitting at home after one day school and
[18:15] I was just bragging about
[18:17] inflation and he was like oh maybe you
[18:19] should look into Bitcoin I was like what
[18:22] are you seeing now like Bitcoin doesn't
[18:24] S any of this like how how could this
[18:27] made up currency solve the question
[18:29] about
[18:30] inflation uh but then I started to like
[18:34] look Bitcoin up and and and like getting
[18:39] my like education on on bitcoin and I
[18:41] realized that wow like this is like this
[18:44] solves this it actually does um so I
[18:48] actually I jumped over the shitcoins I
[18:51] never fell in that hole it was just from
[18:53] when you come from the like economics SP
[18:55] it was just a jump to bitcoin like
[18:57] straight
[18:59] so I guess that's it and also like
[19:02] Bitcoin is the
[19:04] only the the only uh cryptocurrency
[19:07] that's made as an as a solution to like
[19:10] our monetary system that is falling
[19:12] apart and like I I had this
[19:16] um um I don't know how to put it in
[19:19] English but like for me I I think it's
[19:21] pretty clear that you don't understand
[19:24] um the solution of of anything if you
[19:28] don't understand the problem so for
[19:30] example um bit Bitcoin is made as a
[19:33] solution and the problem is a monetary
[19:35] system so for example you won't
[19:37] understand the solution of a of a vacuum
[19:39] cleaner if you don't understand that you
[19:42] don't want a dirty floor so like if
[19:43] someone put a v vacuum cleaner in front
[19:45] of you you would just be looking at it
[19:47] you would be like okay what do I do with
[19:49] this I don't know and the same goes with
[19:50] Bitcoin like if somebody puts Bitcoin in
[19:52] front of you you will be like what do I
[19:54] do with this I I don't know and so when
[19:57] when you understand that Bitcoin is made
[19:58] at
[19:59] a solution to to our monetary system you
[20:01] don't need the cheit coins you
[20:05] don't so that that's BTC chick and not
[20:09] crypto chick I love it and the one thing
[20:13] that just popped up in my mind when you
[20:15] said you have to understand the problem
[20:17] and to understand the solution I feel
[20:19] like in the Western World Sweden Austria
[20:22] all the America even um inflation is
[20:26] there inflation is a problem
[20:29] but I feel like it's not a big enough
[20:31] problem for people to really grasp that
[20:34] it is a problem like people still think
[20:37] yeah there's war there was Co we have a
[20:39] little bit inflation now it will be good
[20:41] in one two years like I feel like that's
[20:43] the the the mainstream narrative around
[20:46] inflation it will be better and we're
[20:48] coming down with inflation prices are
[20:51] not Rising dramatically as we hear from
[20:53] Venezuela and stuff like that uh is the
[20:56] Western World just too arrogant uh to
[20:59] understand Bitcoin I think so and and
[21:02] especially like at the younger
[21:05] generation like I I represent generation
[21:08] that's way too comfortable because
[21:10] everything works out like way too good
[21:12] for us where like I usually say that a
[21:15] blip with with my Visa and MasterCard
[21:17] that seems to solve like most of my
[21:19] problems and like my My Generation we
[21:22] know that there's an inflation going on
[21:24] but we don't truly understand what
[21:26] inflation really means and we understand
[21:28] that like the world is somehow corrupt
[21:31] but we don't see how corrupt it is and
[21:35] so so yeah for sure for sure is that
[21:38] then when we look in the broader scale
[21:41] and a massive chance for all the
[21:43] developing countries I think you even
[21:45] wrote a a paper with with the university
[21:48] about the Bitcoin role in developing
[21:50] countries if I'm I'm not not I'm not
[21:52] mistaken yeah I did uh that's amazing uh
[21:56] I I did not have the chance till now to
[21:58] to read it carefully I just like
[22:00] overlooked it a little bit uh with the
[22:02] two things you wrote like I think about
[22:05] bricks and about uh the role Bitcoin
[22:09] role in developing countries I think the
[22:11] story was also cool uh because you had
[22:13] to convince your professor to actually
[22:16] write about Bitcoin and you had to write
[22:19] about bricks first how how was how was
[22:21] that going like I found like that story
[22:25] in my studies it's so interesting
[22:27] because uh imagine like wait I just had
[22:30] to
[22:32] sorry H IM imagine
[22:35] like imagine that um like I studied
[22:39] International political economy this
[22:42] should be people that are like so aware
[22:45] and up to dat with e e economy and so my
[22:50] my my St is right now they're actually
[22:52] on hold at the moment uh and my goal is
[22:55] to complete them but I'm taking a double
[22:57] bachelor in criminology International
[22:59] political economy but both of them are
[23:01] mainly focused on bitcoin so I wanted to
[23:04] write my first uh thesis it's called B
[23:09] thesis it's the one you write before
[23:11] your Bachelor and I wanted to write that
[23:13] about Bitcoin but my professor he said
[23:15] that it was too abstract and he was like
[23:18] okay but this is a quite short paper
[23:21] Bitcoin is very abstract so or no you
[23:23] you shouldn't write about that
[23:26] and like for me I was like okay maybe it
[23:28] is too abstract to write in a in a b
[23:31] Paper but instead he was like okay you
[23:33] can write about bricks so I jumped into
[23:36] bricks and like if anyone if anything is
[23:39] more complicated than Bitcoin and I
[23:41] don't think that Bitcoin is that
[23:42] complicated like when you start to dig
[23:44] into it but if something is way more
[23:46] complicated than Bitcoin it's bricks so
[23:50] but but but anyway
[23:51] my my final note in in that thesis were
[23:57] like the break's goal is to reduce the
[24:01] the dollar hegemony and like my final
[24:04] note was that maybe we can achieve that
[24:06] in other ways like a little hint and
[24:09] then for my bachelor thesis I I finally
[24:13] got to write about Bitcoin but that was
[24:15] after a lot of con consideration so uh
[24:19] like I asked my my adviser if I could
[24:21] write about Bitcoin and he was like no
[24:24] like I don't know it's not that much of
[24:27] of research about that it would be very
[24:29] hard for you and I was like what what do
[24:31] you mean not not not enough research we
[24:33] have we have a lot of research um and
[24:36] and honestly like how will we ever have
[24:40] enough research if no one ever starts re
[24:43] res researching so uh but but he said no
[24:47] first H and then I like I wrote down I
[24:51] think it was three pages uh about like
[24:55] from well-founded resources about
[24:57] bitcoin's role in developing countries
[24:59] and I just went to school and I gave
[25:01] that to him and I was like okay read
[25:03] this and like see if if that make make
[25:06] you change your mind and it did um but
[25:09] that was after a lot of consideration so
[25:11] he was like
[25:12] okay it it's going to be hard for you
[25:15] but you can write about that uh and it's
[25:17] actually kind of fun because those three
[25:19] pages that I gave to him that actually
[25:22] became like my introduction to my thesis
[25:26] um so yeah the it's it's possible to to
[25:30] to read on my website if anybody wants
[25:32] to read that uh but for my next Bachelor
[25:35] now it's in criminology H I'm really
[25:38] hoping that I get to write about Bitcoin
[25:40] again and I think that that will be
[25:42] easier than uh for the economic part uh
[25:46] because I think that my advisor will
[25:49] think that I'm going to like convince
[25:52] people that Bitcoin is good for
[25:53] criminals and my plan is of course to to
[25:56] prove him wrong if you're listening to
[25:58] this podcast you might be wondering what
[26:00] is actually the setup look like of Robin
[26:03] or how can I improve my Bitcoin setup
[26:05] and there's two things you have to buy
[26:07] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[26:09] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[26:11] let's focus on the first thing how to
[26:13] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[26:15] only exchange don't deal with the
[26:18] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[26:19] exchange that has an own token or
[26:21] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[26:23] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[26:27] for me the best partner for that and now
[26:30] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[26:32] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[26:34] a self custody solution where you
[26:38] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[26:40] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[26:44] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[26:46] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[26:49] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[26:53] Bitcoin holders if you have more than
[26:55] ,000 in Bitcoin it's a absolutely must
[26:58] have one last thing before we get back
[27:00] to the video I'm really passionate about
[27:02] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[27:05] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[27:08] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[27:11] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[27:14] conference in whole of Europe for all
[27:16] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[27:18] this place in June for all europes it's
[27:21] a must go anyways you are so close to
[27:24] the Bitcoin Pride conference you
[27:25] basically have to come I will do
[27:27] interviews St and I would love to meet
[27:30] you all there use code Robin for all my
[27:33] sponsors to get discounts and use the
[27:35] links down in the description I mean uh
[27:38] Bitcoin is actually really bad
[27:40] for yeah I
[27:42] know you just have to look at the facts
[27:44] I mean even I I worked in uh it security
[27:47] before and the whole at
[27:50] wiers uh said after a long time if you
[27:54] have the chance like because
[27:57] when hackers get in your company and
[28:00] they uh lock everything up and they want
[28:02] then uh ransomware from you uh they
[28:06] steer towards crypto and all the advisor
[28:09] in the it security say to the companies
[28:11] that got hacked use Bitcoin then we
[28:14] might have a chance to catch them don't
[28:16] use any other
[28:17] cryptocurrencies uh and that's like yes
[28:19] Bitcoin is a public transparent Ledger
[28:22] every like when when you know one point
[28:25] and it's connected you have one point
[28:27] and you can follow it along and it's
[28:29] public knowledge like nobody you don't
[28:32] even have to ask the the chaps to open
[28:35] something you just like you can look
[28:37] into Bitcoin and that's why I think uh
[28:40] criminals uh will not use Bitcoin and
[28:44] when all criminals use Bitcoin that's
[28:47] the other argument that I always bring
[28:48] up when every one of the criminals use
[28:51] Bitcoin isn't that the perfect case for
[28:54] Bitcoin being really good money also
[28:57] like there there's like a lot of
[28:59] different arguments around that but we
[29:02] mentioned bricks and people might be not
[29:04] familiar with bricks what what what is
[29:06] uh bricks just uh to to give a short uh
[29:10] thing about it h so bricks is a
[29:12] collaboration uh between countries and
[29:14] like their goal is that they want to H
[29:18] decrease the impact of the dollar um so
[29:21] it's uh oh let's see Brazil um Russia
[29:26] India China
[29:28] and um South Africa I
[29:31] think um I think that there's some some
[29:34] more countries in there
[29:36] now like I I I found of course Brix is
[29:39] super interesting uh but I just wrote my
[29:42] bachelor about that because I couldn't
[29:44] write it about Bitcoin and then I was
[29:46] like okay let let me start start
[29:49] exploring Bitcoin now um but I I'm happy
[29:53] that that I write about that it has a
[29:55] lot to do with like the sanctions and
[29:57] and things like that
[29:59] um so it's super interesting yeah pck
[30:01] definitely is really interesting and
[30:03] especially uh I feel like we seeing
[30:06] slowly slowly the whole theat world
[30:09] collapsing in front of our eyes like
[30:11] when we look at uh what bricks and
[30:14] outside of the US dollar Nations try to
[30:17] do is get away from the uh US dollar
[30:21] dominance they are trying to not be
[30:23] dependent on the US dollars because they
[30:25] can just print them amount of th air and
[30:28] exporting inflation to other countries
[30:30] how many countries are like 66 countries
[30:32] or something like that that are using
[30:34] the US Dollars and I'm not in the United
[30:37] States of America uh which is
[30:39] fascinating that's a great business
[30:41] model for the US they just like printing
[30:43] investing the printed money in their own
[30:45] country and exporting the inflation to
[30:47] all the other countries um that's that's
[30:50] something uh truly amazing to have but
[30:53] this slowly slowly begins to cramble
[30:56] down um Do You See
[30:58] uh that Bitcoin uh will have long-term
[31:02] role in in in just destroying it or will
[31:05] they be destroyed on their own I feel
[31:08] like sometimes I play with that thing
[31:11] they they might try to have gold
[31:13] standard again do do you see like how do
[31:15] you see Fiat like playing out in like
[31:18] next five 10 years when you see uh the
[31:21] bricks uh uh things when they when you
[31:24] see maybe they try gold again because
[31:27] they like oh we have to have some
[31:29] commodity or will they try to inflate
[31:32] till till the end and then it makes a
[31:35] big crash and then we kind of try to
[31:38] build it up on on bitcoin is is do you
[31:40] have any thoughts on on how the Fiat uh
[31:43] world uh will go on for the next
[31:45] longterm
[31:47] time um like yeah I would say that not
[31:51] not the gold standard again uh probably
[31:54] then like they will see like my hope is
[31:57] that they they start to see like the
[31:59] true value of Bitcoin and then maybe we
[32:01] start using Bitcoin as a reserve uh
[32:04] currency
[32:05] but like I think like
[32:09] uh I don't know if you know this quote
[32:11] by Elon Musk he says that some people
[32:14] don't like sh change but you need to
[32:16] embrace change if the alternative is a a
[32:19] disaster and like for the Fiat part like
[32:22] a future with Bitcoin will happen
[32:25] whether we like it or not and I'm quite
[32:27] scared like how far do we need to go
[32:29] before it happens like either we we
[32:32] actually need to see some better Cooper
[32:34] cooperation with the state um like for
[32:37] example what je Jan free is doing right
[32:39] now uh or it will look ugly like people
[32:43] will lose all of their money due to like
[32:44] inflation and and they will start
[32:46] looking for solution and I also feel
[32:50] like that might be the reason that
[32:52] Bitcoin works so well in in in
[32:54] developing countries because they are
[32:56] actually searching for something else
[32:58] while other countries are not so
[33:01] like like the the world would be a
[33:03] better place with Bitcoin but I am
[33:06] scared like how far do like for example
[33:08] Sweden how far do we need to go before
[33:11] we understand that okay we need to
[33:14] change our Fiat system because this
[33:16] ain't
[33:17] working so but but it's a super good
[33:22] question yeah and especially like how
[33:25] the interesting question is also how far
[33:28] are they willing to go to keep that
[33:30] feeld system running like yeah how how
[33:33] how far down the the monitoring uh
[33:37] monitoring Lane the surveillance Lane
[33:40] will they go to try to keep that system
[33:43] in in place I mean cbdcs are the next
[33:46] thing I guess Sweden is on the role of
[33:49] CBD like they are even like now having a
[33:52] little bit more and more cdbc when there
[33:54] is no cash and it's everything digital
[33:56] they have a
[33:58] way better system if rolling out a CBC
[34:01] do do you feel like Sweden and the Euro
[34:05] and uh the ECP will have like a cbdc in
[34:09] no time or how do are you afraid of
[34:12] cbdcs of one uh
[34:16] cbdcs uh no I don't know like honestly
[34:21] with the UR and everything we have our
[34:23] our own um our own currency in in in
[34:26] Sweden we have seak
[34:28] uh and like the inflation rate there is
[34:31] it's not good at all it has been really
[34:34] bad for the last time and I think that
[34:35] we're like considering uh moving to the
[34:37] to the euro again
[34:40] um but I don't know I haven't thought
[34:42] that much about that honestly oh nice
[34:45] it's it's it's fascinating to to to see
[34:47] the the cbdcs playing out and when I
[34:49] talk with Bitcoin as from Africa they're
[34:51] like not concerned at all when I talk
[34:54] with bitcoiners from EU countries
[34:57] they're really concerned about uh cbdcs
[35:00] it's definitely worth looking into into
[35:03] that um what I'm Wonder wondering
[35:06] besides like Bitcoin and all the things
[35:08] that we already touched in the in the in
[35:10] the podcast is there anything that you
[35:12] really passionate about that we did not
[35:14] cover until
[35:16] now uh yeah like it started pretty
[35:20] recently honestly but I think that like
[35:22] after Madera I I I started to think a
[35:24] lot about like how we talk about Bitcoin
[35:28] and like we the most of us we talk about
[35:33] Bitcoin as an investment the best
[35:35] investment like indeed I do agree and we
[35:38] talk about Bitcoin as a store of
[35:40] value but I feel like we often like we
[35:43] skip the most important part like a
[35:46] store of value okay but what is value
[35:50] like I feel like we we miss that um a
[35:53] lot of times and like let me put put it
[35:56] like this um
[35:58] so imagine a world where all the people
[36:02] suddenly
[36:03] disappears and they've been replaced by
[36:05] by new new individuals who lack previous
[36:08] knowledge so like these individuals that
[36:12] just come into the world they would lack
[36:14] basic communication skills and and
[36:15] knowledge about the world so here value
[36:18] is compared to basic survival instincts
[36:21] and like I find for example the the
[36:24] asent Egypt very interesting because the
[36:27] farohs they saw this they really saw
[36:30] this and like the far was the the
[36:32] ultimate defender of the knowledge for
[36:35] the good of the society so the society
[36:39] he Val they valued the the pharoh better
[36:42] than than he valued himself even though
[36:44] like he did like rituals and and and
[36:48] things that were so extremes but in
[36:51] those time people lived in direct
[36:53] contact with with value I'm going to
[36:55] give an example like so the fs think
[36:59] about this like the knowledge was so
[37:02] important
[37:04] that he he realized that okay my people
[37:06] were so hungry and we have like I found
[37:10] eight
[37:11] berries but which can we eat I need
[37:14] eight people to sacrifice their lives
[37:17] for this knowledge and and people did
[37:19] that because they thought that okay I'm
[37:22] sacrificing my life now I might die
[37:24] because I might get poisoned but the
[37:28] knowledge is more important than my life
[37:31] because I'm doing this for the people so
[37:33] in this aspect the the value is instead
[37:36] directly linked to knowledge uh and
[37:40] people like we perceive value
[37:42] differently another example is like
[37:44] let's say a young girl H in in my in my
[37:47] age maybe and she works daily in a mine
[37:50] risking her life for survival every day
[37:53] so for her value means something some
[37:56] something different
[37:58] uh that than it does for me like I I
[38:01] would never risk my life just to survive
[38:04] the day so here value is directly linked
[38:07] to survival and the same could be
[38:10] applied like for example to let's say
[38:12] you have a daughter and she's been
[38:15] kidnapped and and like if the kidnapper
[38:18] say that okay you need to pay us 1
[38:21] million to get her back would you do
[38:24] that probably yeah probably
[38:28] but I think that you would never try to
[38:30] reduce that price you wouldn't be like
[38:32] uh is it okay if I pay half the price
[38:35] you wouldn't do that because in this
[38:37] aspect value has nothing to do with
[38:40] money like it would it would feel so
[38:42] wrong for you if you will be like can I
[38:45] like put down the price a bit because
[38:48] life cannot be valued in money and I I
[38:50] feel like after the the era of of the
[38:53] FAS a third party has always been like
[38:57] involved between humans like humanity
[38:59] and and and value and this is like for
[39:02] example Banks and like value has off the
[39:06] that like been directly linked to
[39:08] economy and money and yeah of course
[39:11] money fundamentally it serves as as a
[39:13] way to transfer value we say that it's a
[39:16] medium of exchange but but like I think
[39:20] that we should start looking more at
[39:21] Value and like where do where the
[39:23] Bitcoin fence this well when we talk
[39:27] about Bitcoin we talk about Bitcoins
[39:29] directly linked to money and like that
[39:32] it's the safest value investment but
[39:35] nobody talks about the real value and
[39:39] and like value comes with honestly
[39:41] everything like for example why am I
[39:44] participating in this in this podcast
[39:46] and why are you doing this why are you
[39:48] doing your podcast because we want to
[39:51] like I'm guessing now but I'm guessing
[39:53] that you want to spread the word about
[39:54] Bitcoin you want to like spread the
[39:57] knowledge
[39:58] and there's like where the value lies in
[40:00] you and that's the reason that I'm here
[40:02] I also want to spread the knowledge
[40:04] that's where the value lies in me
[40:07] so yeah yeah I really think that we
[40:10] should like start looking at at more at
[40:13] Value and like Bitcoin offers for for
[40:15] the first time since the era of of feras
[40:18] an opportunity to create like direct
[40:20] contact with value again like you can
[40:23] cont contribute um to society and to the
[40:27] the society can reward you without the
[40:29] needing to like a permission or like you
[40:31] don't have to be dependent or on like
[40:34] any third party or
[40:36] everything but but also like the fact
[40:39] that that value and knowledge are
[40:44] Universal everybody has access to to um
[40:47] to value and we see that money is univ
[40:51] is universal but it's not everybody does
[40:53] not have access to money and value is
[40:55] universal everybody has access to to um
[40:59] to value and Bitcoin is also Universal
[41:03] everybody has access to
[41:05] bitcoin so I'm like right now I'm really
[41:08] trying to focus on like what are we
[41:10] missing like we need to startop looking
[41:13] even more at
[41:15] Value in in the Bitcoin sphere I found
[41:18] that really interesting it's an
[41:20] interesting example when uh we also look
[41:23] at adoption adoption rate is usually
[41:25] higher where countries need Bitcoin more
[41:29] because they value Bitcoin more because
[41:31] they need it more and then we come back
[41:33] to this the subjective feeling of of of
[41:35] value um of of of of Freedom also like
[41:39] because they they need the freedom
[41:40] aspect more than we need in in civil in
[41:43] developed countries more than developing
[41:46] countries what is actually uh random
[41:49] question but what is freedom for you
[41:50] what what is the value of of Freedom uh
[41:53] for you
[41:54] personally wow well a lot of L of people
[41:57] will say that money is freedom some no I
[42:01] I wouldn't I would not agree with that
[42:03] uh my parents they just go back they
[42:05] went to Morocco and they met this girl
[42:07] she was in my age and my dad asked her
[42:11] what do you like to do in your SP
[42:14] time and and she said that I love my
[42:17] spare time I love to go on the garden
[42:20] while I'm just reading a book she was
[42:22] her she she was their guide on like a
[42:25] guided tour and she said I love to just
[42:28] go on on the garden reading a book
[42:31] because that's when I feel the most free
[42:33] I I feel freedom and my dad was like wow
[42:37] she doesn't even know like what what a
[42:39] vacation is she doesn't know that oh
[42:41] here we we went from Sweden to Morocco
[42:44] uh so I like money gives you so much
[42:47] more opportunities but money is not
[42:49] Freedom like you choose Freedom you
[42:51] choose like how you want to spend your
[42:53] time she's happy with her life because
[42:56] she I don't I I would say that she
[42:58] doesn't know any better um she could
[43:00] probably do more but like she's so happy
[43:04] in her situation just that she can be in
[43:06] her garden reading her book and like I'm
[43:08] really into to mindset and my dad said
[43:12] that you would like connect so good with
[43:14] this person because you H you had the
[43:16] same mind so freedom for me it's
[43:20] honestly like get getting everything out
[43:23] of life
[43:24] and like being happy with with what I'm
[43:28] doing like it doesn't it doesn't have
[43:31] anything to do if I if what I'm earning
[43:33] but it has everything to do with like
[43:35] how I'm spending my time that's freedom
[43:37] for me I'll say I I love it and also um
[43:42] when I encounter younger people in my
[43:45] family uh when they're like questioning
[43:48] a little bit oh what they should do
[43:49] because at 14 15 you kind of have to
[43:51] like decide what do you want to do in
[43:53] life like this or that uh or like this
[43:56] question comes up
[43:57] like for every person people can also
[44:00] question that when they are 50 or 45 or
[44:03] like like 35 or something like that and
[44:06] what I always like to ask is like what
[44:09] would you do if someone paid for
[44:12] everything like what would you do every
[44:15] day when you don't have to pay for wood
[44:17] when you don't have to pay for your
[44:19] living situation when you don't have to
[44:21] pay for anything everything is paid for
[44:23] for yourself um what would you do then
[44:26] with your time and this is where Freedom
[44:29] comes in and the the most amazing and
[44:31] beautiful definition of freedom is like
[44:33] you have the choice what you do like uh
[44:37] when you can choose um to say to
[44:40] everything to anyone and to uh anything
[44:43] yes and no like you can choose what you
[44:47] do you like great example but if if I
[44:50] decide like oh I want to have an coffee
[44:53] in America in the next 2 hours it's
[44:56] really hard for me to do because I have
[44:57] to fly for a long time takes a it's lot
[45:01] a lot of money to have such a
[45:03] spontaneous flight and stuff like that
[45:06] but if you have total freedom uh uh of
[45:09] of yourself and money and everything
[45:11] then you can actually decide oh yes
[45:13] let's let's fly to Miami it's a six-hour
[45:15] flight but let's have a coffee there uh
[45:18] so um this is basically freedom and of
[45:21] course it's a lot connected to money
[45:23] because money is like the the base layer
[45:26] of everything every transaction has has
[45:28] money involved somehow uh even if it's
[45:31] not visible directly uh but yet that's
[45:34] that's really cool uh a question because
[45:36] you mentioned mindset that mindset is
[45:38] really important for you like what's the
[45:40] what's the most important trade that you
[45:42] can have in the mindset that you're
[45:44] really passionate about is there
[45:45] anything that you're like this you have
[45:47] to have in your character tradit in your
[45:49] mindset uh that uh that is important for
[45:52] yourself and wow choose happiness see uh
[45:57] see the see the the beautiful thing in
[45:59] in everything
[46:01] like I I can find myself in situations
[46:04] where I that are like really difficult
[46:07] and really hard and
[46:09] somehow I found the beauty in that like
[46:11] I can see that for example if you're at
[46:14] school and imagine that you're like
[46:17] buying a coffee and you're you spill
[46:20] everything out like on all on all of you
[46:23] you're like you're walking in the
[46:24] University with coffee all over you and
[46:25] you bought this coffee and it just been
[46:29] been a disaster and instead of like
[46:32] walking there being angry at yourself
[46:35] I'm trying to like stop there and
[46:37] thinking that wow I'm in the universary
[46:40] right now I'm in Sweden I get to wear
[46:42] clothes I just bought a coffee that I
[46:45] spilled over me I can buy a new
[46:47] coffee like there we go with money again
[46:52] but yeah like that
[46:54] minded like be thankful for every little
[46:58] thing like you can buy a new coffee it
[47:00] doesn't matter that much
[47:02] and yeah and Trust the Universe I trust
[47:05] the universe with everything it's uh my
[47:08] mom always said it's I think it's a
[47:10] really common in Austria to say I don't
[47:12] know if it's a worldwide thing if if
[47:14] some door closes some some other door
[47:17] opens uh like that's also like she also
[47:20] believes a lot in in the universe I try
[47:22] to um have the best in mind for myself I
[47:26] mean this is complet off of Bitcoin now
[47:28] this this talk but um I feel like there
[47:32] is some higher thing who rewards you if
[47:36] you're really putting the work in even
[47:39] if you're putting in a work in that's uh
[47:41] kind of Senseless but you're trying the
[47:43] best and you're trying to figure out
[47:45] what's what sense is and stuff like that
[47:47] uh somebody will reward you otherwise
[47:50] it's it's hard for me to believe that
[47:52] everything is kind of put in place like
[47:54] I don't know I had sometimes the feeling
[47:56] that you know the fre uh the how is it
[47:58] called TR man show uh where where
[48:01] everything is like planned and and only
[48:04] one person is like free in there but
[48:06] he's
[48:08] like um all the actors sometimes it
[48:11] feels like that uh but it's it's it's
[48:13] amazing to to have the freedom and to do
[48:15] what you want to do and you being able
[48:17] to choose freedom and being able to to
[48:19] do uh everything yeah really cool iy for
[48:23] for sure like just to fill that in I got
[48:25] a question just uh before jumping into
[48:28] this podcast um my dad said are you
[48:31] nervous and I said no because I trust
[48:34] Universe like if if I like screw this up
[48:37] and say something stupid I trust
[48:39] universe that much that okay then
[48:42] something better is coming for me
[48:45] so like I trust trust Universe with
[48:48] everything yeah definitely it's it's
[48:51] it's you have to trust in the in the
[48:53] process of
[48:54] stuff I I did not knew that I even have
[48:58] uh a podcast like just in November last
[49:00] year and now I have one and I looked I
[49:04] think three days ago in in my analytics
[49:07] and I got this crazy anal uh statistics
[49:10] H almost 20,000 people watch me just on
[49:14] YouTube every week which is like what
[49:17] what and month incredible and monthly
[49:21] it's like 100,000 people and and I'm
[49:22] like I just started this out because I
[49:24] wanted to connect with more uh
[49:26] bitcoiners and all of the sudden people
[49:28] watch me and people are are willing to
[49:31] pay for sponsorships people are willing
[49:33] uh to pay me uh Channel memberships uh
[49:37] for like monthly if well things to get
[49:39] for free honestly also uh it's it's just
[49:43] amazing for me and I'm I'm really
[49:44] thankful and I feel like uh you have to
[49:47] really work hard then then you get
[49:48] rewarded somehow and you have you have a
[49:51] little chance to to alter things uh but
[49:54] some things just are are meant for you
[49:57] perfect you're doing it so good I'm I'm
[50:00] trying I'm trying thank you Amy we're
[50:02] coming closer to the end routine uh and
[50:04] our end in the podcast is where our
[50:06] previous guest is asking a question for
[50:09] the the next guest without knowing who
[50:11] the next guest is and the question is a
[50:14] really interesting one what is your
[50:16] opening line for Bitcoin uh with a pre
[50:19] corer like when you have like someone
[50:21] that does not get Bitcoin or doesn't
[50:24] understand Bitcoin or they are not in
[50:25] Bitcoin yet uh what is your like opening
[50:28] line how do you uh spark a conversation
[50:31] with them about
[50:32] Bitcoin I would for sure
[50:35] say uh I I would say do you do you
[50:40] understand our current monetary
[50:42] system and they will say yeah I do and
[50:45] then I would say okay tell me about it
[50:47] and then I would just oh no you don't
[50:48] understand the current monetary
[50:50] system and then I would say okay do you
[50:53] do you trust our monetary system and
[50:56] there was say yes and then I will say
[51:00] okay do you know that you don't even
[51:02] have to trust Bitcoin you can verify
[51:05] Bitcoin you don't even have to trust
[51:07] that Bitcoin works you can see that it
[51:09] works same goes with for example your
[51:12] phone your cell phone do
[51:14] you like do you use your phone yeah yeah
[51:19] everybody uses their phone today do you
[51:22] understand what's happen like what's
[51:24] happening beyond that screen when you're
[51:25] using it
[51:27] no you don't but it works right so you
[51:30] don't have to understand everything
[51:31] about Bitcoin like I would H I think I
[51:34] would start there and then like start
[51:36] digging into to the problem with our
[51:38] current monitor system and just make
[51:40] them understand
[51:42] that you use our current monetary system
[51:46] without even understanding
[51:48] it try Bitcoin yeah it's amazing when I
[51:53] uh tell them oh but it's so complicated
[51:55] to understand Bitcoin and stuff like
[51:57] that I'm like first of all not everybody
[51:58] has to understand Bitcoin because uh you
[52:01] send WhatsApp messages every day and you
[52:04] understand when this second uh thck is
[52:07] coming that the other one got it yeah
[52:11] but can you actually explain what's
[52:13] happening there technically I feel like
[52:16] maybe 1% of the population can because
[52:18] they learn it in in it in school or
[52:20] something like that or not not even 1%
[52:23] probably like 0.1% can actually explain
[52:26] uh what the tcpi pro tcpip protocol is
[52:29] and how this all works uh in in in shape
[52:31] and I studied it and I cannot fully
[52:35] explain it honestly it's it's way
[52:37] complicated it's way more complicated
[52:39] than that um and it's it's it's really
[52:42] important to to make them question their
[52:44] belief and you can you can even choose
[52:47] to go with a a really hard question in
[52:50] in the in the in in this in this
[52:51] conversation with like do you think
[52:54] inflation is theft
[52:56] I I love I love that one but like my
[53:00] friends would answer what is inflation
[53:02] yeah it's it's what what most people
[53:04] don't understand this what what is
[53:06] inflation how do you define inflation
[53:10] actually
[53:12] um I would say that every
[53:16] time like how how if I'm if I'm we're
[53:20] about um explain inflation to dummy I
[53:23] would say that um do you know that you
[53:25] have money your bank account yeah I do
[53:28] okay do you know that our Central Bank
[53:33] they print money every day so the Burger
[53:36] that you bought for five years ago it
[53:40] cost 75 Swedish crowns and now you pay
[53:44] 100 for that have you ever thought of
[53:46] that uh and I would probably say that
[53:49] every time like the Central Bank print
[53:51] money that the money that you stored in
[53:53] your bank account loses value I would
[53:55] just try to keep it it like as simple as
[53:57] possible that's that's amazing and uh
[54:00] very very true and uh I feel like we
[54:03] have to challenge the things because
[54:05] most people still believe that 2%
[54:07] inflation is good we touched on it a
[54:08] little bit uh and uh I I'm really
[54:11] outrageous sometimes when people are
[54:13] like yeah but we need inflation for the
[54:15] economy to grow why why do we need a
[54:18] central authority to steal our
[54:20] purchasing power to have some progress I
[54:23] think we humans are better than that
[54:26] yeah you can get the economy moving in
[54:27] other ways yeah definitely you can just
[54:30] be productive for one uh perfect then
[54:34] thank you Amy thank you PDC chick uh for
