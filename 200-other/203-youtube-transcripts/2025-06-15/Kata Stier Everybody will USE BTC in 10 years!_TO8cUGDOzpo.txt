[00:00] you can't discuss Bitcoin without
[00:02] politics in like 10 Years everybody will
[00:04] be using Bitcoin and it will be
[00:06] widespread once someone got to study the
[00:10] traditional Financial system it's not
[00:12] too hard to understand why Bitcoin is a
[00:15] very very important tool we are living
[00:17] in a scam since 1971 it's a scam there
[00:20] is nothing nice to say about it you
[00:22] don't need to be a Tey you use the
[00:25] internet do you know how it works do you
[00:27] care no they ruin the education on
[00:30] purpose someone who sees Bitcoin as an
[00:32] investment still doesn't understand
[00:35] Bitcoin as a whole money has been always
[00:38] taboo we don't talk about money and I
[00:40] have Goosebumps now as I'm talking you
[00:41] know because I saw his eyes and he was
[00:44] like oh Mommy what he just felt it you
[00:46] know that this is something
[00:48] [Music]
[00:52] big the P podcast was in Hungarian and
[00:56] um you know Finding guests after three
[00:59] years it was quite
[01:01] challenging I started to do podcasts
[01:03] also in English but with the Hungarian
[01:05] audience it didn't go well obviously we
[01:08] have language barriers and although it
[01:10] was subtitled they don't really like it
[01:15] so yeah I was just um not motivated
[01:19] anymore you know so you did it every
[01:21] week for like how long two years three
[01:24] years or three years oh that's a lot of
[01:27] episodes like that's 150 episodes right
[01:29] exactly exactly even more and uh it was
[01:32] not just about Bitcoin but also I made
[01:35] like of topics like
[01:37] technology uh
[01:40] digitalization um I also had a guest
[01:43] like a former uh president of
[01:46] the um Central Bank of Hungary so yeah
[01:50] it was it was pretty good but I will
[01:53] tell you on the on the record because
[01:57] say everything and
[02:00] we're already recording so let's let's
[02:01] let's keep it
[02:03] going I I usually do a like I usually do
[02:06] um a nice start but sometimes it flows
[02:09] into it and then I just like keep
[02:11] recording and uh then it's then it's
[02:13] like a it's a cold start I would say but
[02:16] yeah like like keep going yeah yeah and
[02:19] and he also was like a minister the
[02:21] Finance Minister of Hungary and uh yeah
[02:24] I was trying to get you know uh a nice
[02:27] selection of people to go around the
[02:30] topic and
[02:32] um um yeah but you know after a while it
[02:35] was really really very hard to find new
[02:38] guests so yeah I was just rather I do
[02:42] some other things and uh but I still
[02:44] have I don't know desire to make one day
[02:47] a podcast uh but for now I'm crazy busy
[02:51] so I have no time and you know providing
[02:54] quality uh requires time and energy so I
[02:58] don't want to do something something
[03:00] which is not like uh perfect or or close
[03:03] to perfect or at least um
[03:08] listenable for the audience yeah
[03:11] so that's absolutely yeah it's really uh
[03:16] it's hard work I do it full-time of
[03:18] course I do it every day uh and the
[03:21] guests are not no problem because I do
[03:22] it English so because there so many
[03:25] bitcoiners out there but if like hunger
[03:27] is not a huge for those people because I
[03:30] have mostly people in America UK Canada
[03:33] they might not know Hungary Hungary is
[03:35] like a really small country like Austria
[03:37] in a similar size I would say uh so
[03:40] finding there enough guests to fill a
[03:44] Bitcoin podcast which is a niche topic
[03:46] it's not like yeah technology podcast
[03:48] you probably can feel but a Bitcoin
[03:50] podcast is like a niche of a niche uh so
[03:53] that's that's a that's a difficult task
[03:55] uh uh so that's I think you have to go
[03:58] English at that point like you have to
[04:00] either do two podcasts where you have
[04:02] Hungarian once a month and maybe English
[04:05] like three or four or five times a month
[04:07] I don't know uh or like just do it in
[04:09] English and I decided actually to do it
[04:11] only English because there are so many
[04:14] good German podcast like I was like I
[04:17] don't need to fill a hole in the German
[04:19] Market I obviously don't F have to fill
[04:21] a hole in the English Market because
[04:22] there are great English podcast also but
[04:26] I want to speak every day with a
[04:27] bitcoiner and I want to speak with
[04:29] Hungarian bitcoiners I want to speak
[04:31] with African bitcoiners from from
[04:33] America from Canada from everywhere and
[04:35] not just in the German small bubble
[04:37] because like the German speaking
[04:39] Community is a bubble it's they all have
[04:43] a similar worldview uh and they don't
[04:47] understand how African bitcoiner looks
[04:49] at Bitcoin they don't understand how
[04:51] salvadorians or maybe Salvador a little
[04:53] bit more because we hear a lot from
[04:54] there but yeah it's that's why I want to
[04:57] do it English and international but yeah
[04:59] it's really interesting what did you
[05:01] learn from from doing so many Bitcoin
[05:03] podcasts what was your like one of u a
[05:05] bigger learning that you had from all
[05:07] those
[05:08] podcast I don't even know where to start
[05:11] it was a lot you know uh first of all I
[05:14] was very excited at at first you know
[05:16] because I didn't have any experience so
[05:18] first when I started we didn't even do
[05:20] with video uh just uh just audio and
[05:24] obviously I needed some time to to get
[05:27] used to it to be familiar with the
[05:30] technology you know with the platform I
[05:31] was using for
[05:33] recording and um The Works afterwards
[05:37] and obviously the people because uh it
[05:40] wasn't live so I Al I always prepared in
[05:43] advance like a week uh advance and
[05:46] obviously I was trying to organize it uh
[05:49] like weeks ahead but it was also very
[05:52] tricky because you know people have
[05:53] lives so you need to um pick up and uh
[06:00] um and the people the it was it was a
[06:04] huge selection of different uh people
[06:06] with different profiles obviously it was
[06:09] a Bitcoin podcast but as I mentioned
[06:11] earlier I was trying to put in like off
[06:14] topics and um uh there were um uh very
[06:19] very interesting uh discussions about um
[06:23] about basically
[06:25] economics uh
[06:27] technology um artificial intelligence
[06:30] Payment Systems um also politics however
[06:34] I was always trying to avoid politics
[06:38] but this is a bad approach because you
[06:41] can't discuss Bitcoin without politics
[06:44] and I think this was one of the biggest
[06:45] lessons what I learned because the
[06:48] podcast was in collaboration with
[06:50] hungary's oldest um online magazines
[06:54] called Bitcoin Bish and um it was the
[06:58] podcast was under their
[07:01] roof uh and also the magazine and and I
[07:04] think all these kind of magazines are
[07:07] try to avoid
[07:09] politics so I was the same and once you
[07:13] go further down to the rabbit hole it's
[07:16] necessary to realize that there is no
[07:18] Bitcoin without
[07:20] politics or else I can put it
[07:23] differently like Bitcoin is above
[07:26] politics in my view so it was was very
[07:29] very interesting uh to realize this
[07:32] these kind of stuff and and I really
[07:35] learned a lot I I just mentioned the uh
[07:37] the man who was pre who was former
[07:40] Minister uh of Hungary and actually I
[07:43] was asking him about um the Austrian
[07:46] economics and he was uh very very
[07:49] surprised like what the hell I want with
[07:52] with Austrian economics and obviously he
[07:55] he realized what I wanted with it and um
[07:58] he had a great uh answer to that but but
[08:02] this is also very interesting that um
[08:05] what I realized I'm a lawyer so I
[08:08] attended the university I learned
[08:11] economics uh micro uh micro Statics stat
[08:16] statistics whatever but I never ever
[08:19] heard about um anything else but the
[08:23] mainstream so not even to to develop um
[08:28] critical thinking
[08:30] uh for the students whatever uh reason
[08:33] there was O only the mainstream um
[08:36] knowledge what I was taught and actually
[08:40] 20 years passed after I finished
[08:43] University and I feel like um a little
[08:45] girl who is studying these topics never
[08:49] heard before which is very nice because
[08:52] I love to learn new stuff but in the
[08:54] other hand disaster it's it's
[08:58] unacceptable
[09:00] totally unacceptable that you don't
[09:02] learn things like this not because we
[09:05] all are um revolutionaries who want to
[09:10] um uh ruin this uh fantastic system we
[09:13] live in I Amo but not uh all the others
[09:17] are like me but we all need to know
[09:20] about this different
[09:22] perspectives don't we otherwise how we
[09:25] can understand the whole picture I
[09:28] understand though why is it not thought
[09:30] I'm not so Nave but but still this was a
[09:34] huge
[09:35] realization and actually this is what
[09:37] got me started um in full force because
[09:41] I already started before I started the
[09:43] podcast uh to to to learn about Bitcoin
[09:46] to deal with Bitcoin uh but this was uh
[09:50] another um point when I realized that I
[09:53] need to go
[09:54] full into Bitcoin ah really really cool
[09:58] how is um currently I mean Hungary it's
[10:02] it's it's a small country but still uh
[10:04] how is the politics there towards
[10:07] Bitcoin uh and are politics even
[10:10] speaking about it or is it a non-topic
[10:12] or how is it treated there to be honest
[10:15] I don't live in Hungary I left
[10:18] Hungary almost 15 years ago I used to
[10:22] live in uh in the UK and um in the last
[10:26] 12 years we've been living in Malta
[10:28] middle of the Mediterranean Sea best
[10:30] place
[10:32] ever um however for I don't know now for
[10:37] like four five years I I am involved
[10:40] with the Hungarian bitcoiners and with
[10:42] the scene uh but let let me jump back a
[10:46] little bit to have the full picture how
[10:48] I got started and then you will have a
[10:50] better understanding so it was like 2017
[10:54] the end of 2017 when I accidentally got
[10:57] involved with with Bitcoin
[11:00] uh and let me just tell you a a a
[11:03] private story about about this my
[11:05] husband um he's a head
[11:08] addresser and
[11:10] uh none of the conferences can beat a
[11:13] hair saloon for networking purposes you
[11:15] know and um he was always my pimp if I
[11:19] may say something like that because he
[11:21] used to have a lot of clients you know
[11:23] and uh they they they had always
[11:25] requests for a lawyer for this for for
[11:28] for things like that and one day there
[11:32] was this guy um from
[11:34] Switzerland uh used to live here in
[11:37] Malta half Hungarian half Swiss and he
[11:40] was a client of my husband and one day
[11:44] um he asked if he knew um someone uh a
[11:49] legal professional uh to work to to to
[11:52] be interested to work um in
[11:56] part-time uh also with the possibility
[11:58] to work from home like in a hybrid uh uh
[12:03] situation um with a topic um uh released
[12:08] on a later
[12:09] stage and my husband said that um yes I
[12:12] know a person and U she's my wife and
[12:16] then things started to escalate this was
[12:18] the time when our first um kid was born
[12:21] and I was at home but I but it was he
[12:24] was almost already one year old and I
[12:26] started to look around you know to go
[12:28] back to to
[12:30] work and um things started escalating so
[12:34] I met this guy and uh we had this
[12:36] interview with his business partner it
[12:38] was a startup and the product was um a
[12:42] an application uh a payment application
[12:46] to pay with Bitcoin and ether and as I
[12:49] said it was the end of 2017 2000 the
[12:51] beginning of 2018 lightning network was
[12:55] just uh uh at the very very beginning
[12:58] phase of it it and um people didn't
[13:01] really know about that so uh this
[13:04] application was quite new and I think we
[13:07] were uh ahead of our
[13:10] time the concept was that there was this
[13:13] closed loop with FS already in so the
[13:17] Bitcoin payment went through in no time
[13:20] just like lightning
[13:21] Network and um obviously it could be
[13:24] used for small purchases like buying a
[13:26] coffee the the popular phrase you know
[13:29] who can buy a coffee with Bitcoin so it
[13:33] was possible uh through this application
[13:36] and um and actually that was a time here
[13:39] in Malta when um U Malta proclaimed
[13:43] itself as a blockchain island and they
[13:45] had this virtual Financial act um uh in
[13:48] place they they were the first uh
[13:51] globally to come up with the with a
[13:54] crypto uh
[13:56] regulation so so it was really hot here
[14:00] in Malta you know conferences after
[14:03] conferences all the big names came to
[14:05] Malta um and I was part of it but to go
[14:09] back to these interviews with with the
[14:11] owners of the of the startup you know
[14:14] they they started to tell me what to do
[14:16] what will be the job and blah blah blah
[14:18] and I was like I didn't understand a
[14:20] single word although I had like
[14:23] Financial background when I finished
[14:25] with the university in Hungary I used to
[14:26] work for the Hungarian tax and
[14:29] Uh custom department so I had a rough uh
[14:33] imagination about finances and and
[14:35] things like that but all the topics
[14:38] these guys were mentioning Bitcoin
[14:40] blockchain uh uh payments QR codes
[14:44] whatever I was like okay in the other
[14:48] hand I'm quite U Brave and confident
[14:52] most of the time so I was like whatever
[14:54] it is let me try and then we'll see so I
[14:58] started to work for the
[15:00] startup in the first let's say six
[15:03] months I have no idea where I was I have
[15:07] no idea what they were talking about we
[15:09] were just three in the office they rent
[15:12] this huge office more than 100 square
[15:14] meter we were sitting in there three of
[15:17] us because the plan was to hire
[15:19] developers you know C customer care to
[15:22] fill up the space but things weren't uh
[15:25] that
[15:26] simple first of all uh I'm a lawyer so I
[15:30] was looking for law you know like
[15:34] regulation which was nonexistent at the
[15:37] time so I had to made up basically I was
[15:41] the Jolly Joker of the company let's say
[15:43] so you know startups they don't employ
[15:47] uh plenty of people they don't have
[15:49] departments things like that so I was
[15:51] basically the only one with the owners
[15:53] who who had to do everything and figure
[15:55] out basically the job on a daily basis
[15:59] so I did it um I went to all these
[16:02] conferences I I I I I read a lot I I
[16:07] studied and this guy uh the founder he
[16:11] was a Visionary like a typical man uh
[16:14] who just uh I and I have these pictures
[16:17] in my head and I think I will never
[16:19] forget uh in my entire life that he was
[16:22] standing in front of the the window you
[16:24] know like talking to um uh no
[16:27] one just just to the air and he was he
[16:31] was telling me um um he was a he used to
[16:35] be a Swiss Banker so so he had many
[16:37] stories about um the financial system
[16:40] and all these controversies what he
[16:42] experienced and and also the the the
[16:45] idea why he set up this company was that
[16:48] in
[16:49] 2015 there was a guy who approached him
[16:52] uh back in Switzerland and he wanted to
[16:55] buy a property for Bitcoin and that was
[16:57] the time when his guy first heard about
[17:00] Bitcoin and he got this idea like okay
[17:04] what is bitcoin how can we pay with it
[17:06] what is the status blah blah blah and
[17:09] obviously he didn't find too much so
[17:13] that's why he set up this company and he
[17:14] told me all these stories about Bitcoin
[17:17] and he was like uh uh write this down
[17:21] what I'm saying in like 5 10 Years
[17:24] everybody will be using Bitcoin and it
[17:26] will be widespread and everybody will be
[17:29] knowing about it and blah blah blah and
[17:32] first I was like okay so I started to
[17:38] study it and and I believed every word
[17:41] what he said because I put the picture
[17:43] together and it was very easy after the
[17:46] six months what I told you when it
[17:47] wasn't easy but after it got very very
[17:50] easy to understand what he was saying
[17:54] and I still believe until today that
[17:57] once someone uh got to study go the
[18:02] effort actually to
[18:03] study um the traditional Financial
[18:06] system it's not too hard to understand
[18:10] why Bitcoin is a very very important
[18:12] tool but this is a very uh important and
[18:16] unmissable step to deal with the
[18:19] traditional Financial
[18:20] system
[18:23] and back to the story let me finish and
[18:25] then uh I will add some uh some other
[18:28] stuff so
[18:29] so this guy was was was was very
[18:32] enthusiastic and uh and he was on a
[18:35] mission uh so did
[18:38] I I I I really I fairly quickly
[18:42] understood what is going on that we are
[18:44] living in a scam basically since 1971
[18:47] it's a it's a scam there is nothing nice
[18:50] to say about it and I mean the financial
[18:54] system um
[18:57] so I started to to to get involved uh
[19:00] more and more and this company
[19:03] unfortunately failed when when covid
[19:05] came and
[19:07] um and things got uh quite vague and I'm
[19:12] referring to Malta because they started
[19:14] like oh everybody's welcome you know and
[19:16] now we will the uh we have the paradise
[19:20] here
[19:22] um Bitcoin and and um the other
[19:27] cryptocurrencies they said it will be uh
[19:29] legal tender and blah blah blah but
[19:33] obviously never happened and um with the
[19:35] ACT I mentioned earlier now I may say
[19:38] that it was um like a pre m car
[19:42] regulation uh it was very tough very
[19:45] very layered but it was not for startups
[19:50] that was for sure so most of the
[19:52] companies just escaped
[19:54] molta uh their desire wasn't fulfilled
[19:58] with this
[19:59] act so basically the blockchain island
[20:02] uh
[20:04] sunk so so did the company unfortunately
[20:07] but it was uh a bad effect of covid and
[20:10] some other
[20:11] stuff
[20:13] and and basically I was left without uh
[20:16] any work plus I discovered that I am
[20:19] pregnant and there was covid and uh we
[20:22] were left home you know uh wasn't
[20:25] allowed to go out and I was like okay
[20:29] now let's figure figure out what to do
[20:33] but by the time I developed already this
[20:36] passion about Bitcoin so I said
[20:39] okay let me start uh to create my own
[20:43] website uh I had no idea how to do it
[20:46] but I had the time of my life so I I I
[20:49] learned uh how to do like a basic
[20:52] WordPress website and I started to write
[20:54] articles about Bitcoin about um uh
[20:58] technology
[20:59] digitalization as I said and
[21:03] um against the system uh it was in
[21:06] Hungarian also I wrote a couple of
[21:08] articles in English but but mostly in
[21:11] Hungarian and after like one or two
[21:14] months uh it was a huge surprise I got a
[21:17] lot of
[21:18] invitations uh to write to get to know
[21:22] me a little bit better so I got this
[21:25] permanent blog in one of one of
[21:27] hungary's um um oldest um Financial
[21:32] daily Financial magazines I I still have
[21:35] it until today plus I got
[21:39] um um this invitation from Bitcoin Bish
[21:42] who I mentioned earlier this uh uh
[21:44] oldest Hungarian uh Bitcoin uh
[21:48] magazine uh and I started to write for
[21:51] them articles and then after a couple of
[21:54] months I was asked to do the the the
[21:57] podcast and and also um as I said I I am
[22:01] a leager professional I also got some
[22:04] invitations for cooperation so in a very
[22:08] very very fast um
[22:12] um time I think it was like four months
[22:16] and I find myself uh in the middle of uh
[22:20] a very very hectic life with a lot of
[22:22] job so I I I I started my own business
[22:25] I'm a freelance riger professional only
[22:28] advising clients in the in the crypto
[22:31] space but more like u in
[22:35] Bitcoin um we started to translate
[22:38] because I realized and and basically uh
[22:41] that was the starting point of my
[22:43] business that when the startup closed
[22:46] and I made my statistics and um like a
[22:49] like a Clos down my own closedown I
[22:52] realized that by the time the company
[22:54] has shut down we had roughly 4,000 users
[22:59] and out of out of these 4,000 users
[23:02] there were only like two 300 of women
[23:07] and uh and I was like no no way no way
[23:12] but I had this uh um feeling that the
[23:16] reason must be the lack of
[23:19] Education Because by the time there
[23:21] there weren't as much books and uh uh
[23:24] resources as we have
[23:27] nowadays but more mostly in Hungarian we
[23:30] didn't have anything only this magazine
[23:33] not only focusing mostly on bitcoin but
[23:36] not only focusing on bitcoin uh and
[23:39] there was a huge
[23:41] need uh for
[23:43] it
[23:44] so we started to translate books into
[23:49] Hungarian the first uh book we
[23:52] translated was knut Swan holm's
[23:55] sovereignity and uh Independence
[23:59] uh this is already available in
[24:01] Hungarian um then with with the
[24:03] networking and with the podcast I got to
[24:05] know plenty of people some other guys
[24:07] who translated already the Bitcoin
[24:10] standard the Fiat standard the little
[24:13] Bitcoin book so there were these guys uh
[24:16] uh growing out of nowhere obviously they
[24:19] were existing but uh we started to talk
[24:22] to each other um now I'm in the
[24:26] discussion actually this week we will
[24:27] finalize
[24:29] uh and I will have the copy right uh
[24:32] rights for Alex Glen's hidden
[24:36] repression about the IMF and the World
[24:38] Bank um and slowly slow slowly I
[24:42] realized that this is my mission to
[24:45] educate to spread the word but in
[24:48] Hungarian I never wanted to work for the
[24:50] Hungarian Market I left Hungary 15 years
[24:53] ago uh and back to your question sorry
[24:57] it was quite a long
[24:59] answer but back to your question
[25:03] politics no
[25:05] mention uh officially about Bitcoin in
[25:08] Hungary
[25:10] um but there are huge um
[25:15] Improvement as uh also in Hungary the 21
[25:19] group formed like one year roughly a
[25:23] year ago 3 weeks ago we organized
[25:26] because one of the fellow bitcoiners
[25:28] he has a hotel so that was the perfect
[25:32] venue for such um event and um we
[25:38] organized the first Bitcoin only
[25:40] conference in Hungary in Mish this is
[25:43] the name of the town and it and it was a
[25:45] plus to organize it in Mish cours
[25:48] because you know as you also said
[25:51] Hungary is a small country everything
[25:53] happens in the capital in
[25:56] Budapest but we did it on purpose
[25:59] first of all the the hotel is uh in
[26:02] mishal so we couldn't move
[26:05] it and
[26:07] secondly it was on purpose not to do in
[26:10] in in
[26:11] Budapest because we were curious how
[26:14] many people we can attract with these
[26:16] kind of things and it was a huge
[26:19] surprise a very very nice event uh for
[26:23] three days every day the conference room
[26:26] was packed with people more than 100 50
[26:29] attendees uh daily it was a really high
[26:32] quality uh conference I used to go for
[26:35] conferences so I know the standard I
[26:36] know how is a proper Bitcoin conference
[26:39] my my my favorite is honey badger in DGA
[26:42] I attended it a couple of times but um
[26:45] uh this spring we went all together with
[26:48] the guys from the 21 uh Hungarian group
[26:51] to Madera to the Bitcoin
[26:53] Atlantis and it was amazing so we was
[26:57] trying to to organize a similar event
[27:00] and I think we did it uh and there will
[27:03] be the second one next spring huge
[27:07] demand people are very interested so it
[27:09] was really we we were we were so happy
[27:12] to experience uh a wonderful event like
[27:15] this and I was one of the hosts of the
[27:18] event and um I also had the chance to
[27:21] talk to the people uh obviously I want
[27:24] to talk to women and this is another
[27:26] very interesting thing because uh every
[27:29] time I um talk about Bitcoin to to
[27:33] people who don't uh know me they have
[27:37] this preconception you know like oh you
[27:39] must be very techy you must be
[27:41] understanding coding um you must be a
[27:45] geek or something like that and I always
[27:47] explain that listen
[27:49] guys I have no idea obviously I have a
[27:52] bit but like a
[27:55] Layman uh you don't need to be a techi
[27:59] you don't need to understand you
[28:02] use the internet you use apps like Viber
[28:06] or Whatsapp or whatever you use do you
[28:10] know how it works do you
[28:13] care no the answer is always no so
[28:17] then why why would you understand how
[28:20] Bitcoin Works obviously you need to know
[28:22] a couple of things about it but not uh
[28:25] into the deep forest
[28:28] where you get lost for sure slowly
[28:30] slowly and if you develop your interest
[28:32] why not but for the beginning uh to
[28:35] understand Bitcoin you don't need to be
[28:37] a Tei and that's why Bitcoin is
[28:40] wonderful and is a miracle for me
[28:42] because every people can take their
[28:46] understanding of
[28:48] Bitcoin
[28:49] so again back to politics now as mic is
[28:53] getting into effect also in Hungary very
[28:55] soon um yes I have the impression that
[28:59] the authori started to um deal with it
[29:04] not particularly with Bitcoin but with
[29:06] cryptocurrencies and um regulation wise
[29:10] but um I don't think that they are
[29:12] prepared for it obviously we will see I
[29:15] have a couple of clients who are um um
[29:18] who want to get the licenses the proper
[29:21] licenses as they are working for a
[29:23] couple of years now and uh they um they
[29:27] want to obey the law
[29:28] so they go for the
[29:31] license and um this is
[29:35] something I don't I still don't know
[29:37] what is going to happen because this is
[29:39] just the beginning very very
[29:42] early but I'm not I don't think that
[29:45] authorities are are ready for it I don't
[29:47] think that uh they
[29:49] studied uh properly the topic I'm
[29:52] curious to see what is going to happen
[29:56] um but I'm already pissed if I may say
[30:00] so because um I saw that the Hungarian
[30:05] National um the central bank was
[30:07] recruiting for a couple of months to get
[30:09] the right uh people to the right
[30:12] positions I don't know how they managed
[30:14] it but I don't like the idea that people
[30:18] who are not in the industry for certain
[30:20] years are
[30:23] supervising uh
[30:26] um uh um
[30:28] a business which they don't have um
[30:31] enough um knowledge to supervise I
[30:36] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[30:39] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[30:42] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[30:45] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[30:48] vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin watch
[30:51] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[30:54] go out there and show that you are a
[30:57] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[30:59] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[31:02] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:05] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:08] collections you have the date of the
[31:10] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[31:14] and of course also the block height and
[31:16] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[31:20] level of detail they put in in this
[31:22] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[31:24] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:28] down in the descriptions I love those
[31:30] watches so so much if you watch or
[31:33] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:36] I'll guess you already bought some
[31:38] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[31:40] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[31:44] in a hardware wallet my personal
[31:46] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[31:48] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[31:50] to set up it's also a perfect gift for a
[31:52] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[31:55] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[31:59] with the code Robin at the checkout
[32:01] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[32:05] your bitbox and the next step is to
[32:08] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:10] individual you have to have the most
[32:12] secure self custody setup you have to
[32:15] secure your own devices you have to
[32:18] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:21] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:23] where you live you even want to have a
[32:26] plan B a citizenship with you can move
[32:28] in case something goes really really
[32:30] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:32] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:35] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[32:38] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[32:41] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[32:44] how you can level up your sovereignty
[32:47] absolutely yeah it's it's it's I mean
[32:50] they they kind of have the incentive to
[32:53] to hire the wrong
[32:54] people like they don't the the central
[32:57] bank Banks probably don't even want to
[32:59] hire the people that know about Bitcoin
[33:01] and
[33:02] crypto I don't know but I also think
[33:05] that people who who are in the business
[33:08] they don't want to go to work for them
[33:10] either Al yeah would be interesting as a
[33:13] Bitcoin like oh I want to work in the
[33:16] central bank just to blow it up I know a
[33:18] guy who wanted to do that but he wasn't
[33:20] [Laughter]
[33:23] recruited
[33:24] yeah really interesting by the way this
[33:28] hotel I think um it's from fance kovats
[33:34] yes he he was also on the podcast uh so
[33:37] if if people want to check him yeah he I
[33:41] talked with him uh in Prague also uh at
[33:45] the Bitcoin Prague conference uh where
[33:48] he he also told me I think they were
[33:51] right there in the plans of accepting
[33:53] Bitcoin in the hotels or already did it
[33:56] like some somewhere around that timeline
[33:59] uh so it's so it's also was also
[34:01] interesting for with him to discuss if
[34:03] people want to uh check it out and and
[34:05] see that uh that hotel Bitcoin story
[34:08] from from his side exactly uh really
[34:11] interesting uh and you you also work as
[34:14] a lawyer in Bitcoin right now so with
[34:17] like the ma regulations and and stuff
[34:19] like that if I understood that right
[34:21] okay well so so you're working then with
[34:24] exchanges or like with with with who do
[34:27] you work uh in in Bitcoin with as a
[34:30] lawyer yeah I I work for for exchanges
[34:34] wallet service providers uh and there
[34:37] are some some guys who are just at the
[34:39] beginning of the journey want to build
[34:43] something um and yeah uh these are like
[34:47] permanent uh works for for years and and
[34:51] I always have like ad hoc works from
[34:53] people um just to advise them uh about
[34:57] the
[34:58] approach and um I also did um the proof
[35:04] reading of the binance website they they
[35:07] translate it into Hungarian so yeah I
[35:11] was one of the proof readers and yes as
[35:13] I said now uh uh this huge job is ahead
[35:16] of me to do the translation of the book
[35:20] uh and also but this is very inciting
[35:23] phase um I want to do something in
[35:26] Hungary like um education wise um now we
[35:31] are um at the start of uh putting out an
[35:35] application in one of the universities
[35:37] in my
[35:38] hometown um um for designers to create
[35:43] something about Bitcoin this is just
[35:46] to for the Bitcoin adoption to raise
[35:50] awareness you know that there is this
[35:52] thing called
[35:53] Bitcoin you can start to do something
[35:56] with it and I have very good connections
[35:59] uh back in my University so we are now
[36:03] uh in the middle of um uh starting to
[36:05] organize a week for financial awareness
[36:08] where we can spread the word about
[36:11] Bitcoin and um there are also kids books
[36:16] about Bitcoin I'm sure you also know a
[36:18] couple uh uh in particular there is an
[36:22] Austrian girl no and she uh an Austrian
[36:27] uh Bitcoin book or like for
[36:31] kids I don't know uh but
[36:36] maybe but it it could could be could be
[36:38] yeah Austrian Bitcoin kids book oh uh my
[36:42] friend uh called Bitcoin one or Mara's
[36:47] Bitcoin
[36:49] Adventures Mara Bitcoin Adventure also
[36:51] heard maybe yeah maybe that one I'm not
[36:53] sure oh yeah but anyway we have these
[36:56] books I don't know the title because I
[36:59] just bought it I sent it to Hungary and
[37:01] my uh my colleague she she checked it
[37:04] and she said it's a very very good book
[37:07] and uh we want to donate donate it uh to
[37:10] little
[37:11] children to schools to to start to
[37:15] educate uh themselves about Bitcoin we
[37:17] also organize several
[37:20] meetups uh in Hungary
[37:23] so yeah things are getting uh more
[37:28] interesting as we realize that there are
[37:31] these people in the
[37:33] bubble and basically I I am too in my
[37:37] own bubble and we have to connect to
[37:39] each other because for a couple of years
[37:41] I believe that I don't need to connect
[37:43] to anyone I just do my own stuff I don't
[37:46] care it's just you know step by step one
[37:49] by one and I will achieve something but
[37:52] you can't do it like that you need to
[37:54] see the future what do you want to
[37:56] achieve and then to build up uh and
[38:00] luckily or accidentally I found the
[38:03] right people the the right people found
[38:06] me so now we are forming this kind of um
[38:09] group where we where we are on a mission
[38:13] just like you with your podcast we are
[38:16] also in the mission to to educate and
[38:18] really there is this huge barrier uh of
[38:22] uh of the
[38:23] language and uh in my view this is also
[38:27] political question and back to your
[38:29] question once again uh I'm sure you
[38:33] don't follow the Hungarian politics but
[38:36] for example
[38:37] education they ruined the education on
[38:40] purpose uh in my time when I used to go
[38:43] to primary school but obviously this is
[38:45] in relation to uh uh communism as you
[38:50] may know Hungary was under communis
[38:53] communism for more than 40 years so when
[38:56] I was in school
[38:58] we uh we were allowed to learn either
[39:01] Russian or
[39:03] German and I used to learn uh I was
[39:06] always learning German for more than 12
[39:09] years I was learning German half of my
[39:11] family is from Germany my surname is
[39:13] German so it was obvious that I was
[39:16] going to learn German I I I I can't say
[39:19] a single word obviously I can but I
[39:22] totally forgot it if if I would go to
[39:24] Germany or Austria for a couple of weeks
[39:26] I'm sure it would come back but now it's
[39:28] like a sleeping knowledge very very at
[39:30] somewhere at the back of my mind anyway
[39:33] and I also learned um
[39:36] Russian for uh four years couple of
[39:39] words I can read I could write but I
[39:43] never learned English and nowadays it's
[39:46] even worse because for example when I
[39:49] got my University degree it was
[39:51] compulsory to have at least one language
[39:54] exam like middle um um
[39:58] I don't know how it's called like a
[40:02] um like a middle I don't know level of
[40:07] language exam it's not mandatory anymore
[40:10] you don't need to study languages uh
[40:13] they prefer to to uh educate people in
[40:18] Hungarian you you don't have access
[40:21] obviously because of this this uh
[40:23] language barrier to read the news to
[40:26] read books better to read books than the
[40:29] news to read books to watch
[40:31] documentaries or whatever and not only
[40:34] Bitcoin but whatever topic you are
[40:36] interested in nowadays it's it's it's
[40:40] very very hard to to get these kind of
[40:45] uh resources because there is nothing
[40:47] available in Hungarian who would
[40:49] translate this kind of stuff in
[40:50] Hungarian no one so but the government
[40:54] they I'm sure they do this on purpose
[40:57] go to to to grow up these sheeps uh for
[41:02] good workers you know not to think it's
[41:05] easier to manipulate people like that
[41:08] so so that's why uh this is a very very
[41:13] serious mission for me um to to provide
[41:18] these kind of resources in Hungarian
[41:20] because people have have to know they
[41:23] has to know about it so so yes so the
[41:27] English uh level in Hungary is is is not
[41:29] as good so the people don't even can
[41:32] really understand uh outside of uh yeah
[41:37] outside of Hungarian language that's
[41:39] interesting because that really does
[41:41] something like if if you only have your
[41:44] own language and your own language is
[41:45] not English uh that then you usually are
[41:50] in in a in a way smaller bubble I mean
[41:53] there are there's Mandarin like Hindi
[41:55] there's like other languages they like
[41:58] huge uh but especially for like Hungary
[42:01] where there's only like a small part of
[42:03] it that's a that's a huge problem and
[42:05] and I I can only encourage anybody who
[42:08] who lives in in a country like Hungary
[42:11] uh like get as fluent as possible uh as
[42:15] possible in English uh not only do like
[42:19] get knowledge but also do like spread
[42:20] knowledge I think that's really
[42:22] important uh and also um a question that
[42:26] never really asked on a podcast because
[42:28] you are only my second lawyer even
[42:30] though I had over 300 in podcast guests
[42:33] already on from a legal standpoint just
[42:36] being a bitcoiner is there anything
[42:38] someone should be aware of is there
[42:41] anything that can H bad happen if we
[42:44] should post on social media around buy
[42:48] Bitcoin otherwise you will be poor
[42:49] something like that like is is there
[42:51] anything that you like hey bitcoiners
[42:54] Please be aware that could be obviously
[42:56] everyone is in a different part of the
[42:58] world and different jurisdictions uh but
[43:01] is there anything that you can
[43:03] share I would encourage everyone to do
[43:07] their posts because yes when I
[43:11] started uh as I said in
[43:14] 1718 we couldn't put ads on the internet
[43:19] because it it wasn't allowed all all
[43:22] these um uh agencies were asking for
[43:25] license numbers and uh and things like
[43:28] that but obviously no one had a license
[43:30] number because license was nonexistent
[43:32] and I was trying uh hours with the
[43:35] Indian uh customer cares uh guys poor
[43:39] guys uh to explain that listen this is
[43:43] the situation we don't have and these
[43:45] were from from Google the guys uh but
[43:49] then we just gave up you know it was
[43:51] impossible to do anything and then we we
[43:54] did it on purpose obviously everywhere
[43:56] like like a sabotage to write everywhere
[43:59] and uh and um and post as much as we can
[44:03] buy Bitcoin and you know all the
[44:06] slogans nowadays although um it is legal
[44:12] now we have the license numbers but um
[44:14] uh
[44:16] mysteriously quite frequently I see
[44:19] these kind of posts could be fake news
[44:22] too I never verify them it's not so
[44:25] important but last week for example I
[44:27] saw a guy who created um what was it
[44:32] created uh like a brochure about Bitcoin
[44:35] and nothing no Financial advice or
[44:37] things like that was included uh just an
[44:40] educational um um Le flat about Bitcoin
[44:45] and he created it with
[44:46] KVA and then he got the oh I think I saw
[44:50] it on
[44:51] nost and it was deleted by Kaa and I
[44:54] just saw the screenshot that it was uh
[44:56] it was just
[44:58] band so and it's crazy for me that
[45:01] nowadays something like this can happen
[45:04] when Bitcoin is a legal tender in couple
[45:06] of countries in this world and this is
[45:09] just pure stupidity for me and reflects
[45:14] back to the owner of KVA if I can
[45:20] intimidate someone I don't
[45:23] want but come on educate yourself folks
[45:27] please read Because this is pure
[45:30] stupidity and I only can hope that in a
[45:33] couple of years these people will
[45:36] realize how stupid they were not to uh
[45:40] educate themselves about the topic so I
[45:43] I don't have any advice not to be brave
[45:45] and do do uh whatever you feel like to
[45:48] do because there is no law that can
[45:51] prevent you to do this I love that
[45:55] that's the that's the answer was looking
[45:58] forward because I because I I'm doing
[46:02] exactly
[46:03] that um one thing that you said in the
[46:05] beginning that was really interesting
[46:07] also uh because you said that when you
[46:11] speak about oh I'm into Bitcoin then
[46:14] people come to you and say like oh you
[46:15] have to be technical like this those
[46:17] things which obviously is not true you
[46:20] do you you can understand Bitcoin on a
[46:22] fundamental level without being able to
[46:25] code Bitcoin like um most people use the
[46:28] internet as you also brought up in the
[46:30] example um what but what are some really
[46:34] important things that that you thought
[46:36] that that people really should know when
[46:39] they get into Bitcoin like what are the
[46:41] the things that we we definitely should
[46:43] teach uh about Bitcoin uh outside of the
[46:47] technical things obviously slimit and
[46:49] stuff like that but what is the like
[46:51] what is the core message for you uh in
[46:54] in Bitcoin freedom for me Bitcoin never
[46:57] was an investment and I never start like
[47:00] that and I also think that someone who
[47:03] sees Bitcoin as an
[47:05] investment um
[47:08] still doesn't understand Bitcoin as a
[47:12] whole it can be an investment too and I
[47:16] would be stupid not to
[47:18] see the level of weth Bitcoin can create
[47:23] obvious this is
[47:24] obvious but what I want
[47:27] other people understand is more like the
[47:31] monetary
[47:32] system what Bitcoin
[47:34] has and what I also told you that
[47:39] without understanding The Current
[47:41] financial
[47:42] system no one will understand Bitcoin
[47:45] and no one will understand why we need
[47:47] Bitcoin so my most
[47:51] important um
[47:53] task is to make
[47:57] people sit down and read those economics
[48:01] books to understand what we are living
[48:06] in and I'm sure that people are
[48:09] intelligent enough to understand once
[48:11] they understand the living
[48:14] standard so books like the Bitcoin
[48:17] standard and the Fiat standard
[48:20] compulsory for everyone for everyone to
[48:24] understand and also last time I watched
[48:26] your your uh your episode with
[48:29] Rachel and and she uh said something
[48:35] which I resonate very much because he
[48:39] said that thanks for men for the
[48:41] wonderful men who are very good problem
[48:43] solvers and they created
[48:47] uh he she said that he believes that um
[48:50] uh Satoshi uh on his own he created
[48:53] bitcoin and he's a a very good example
[48:56] of this wonderful uh man who who was
[49:00] working hard and U and U discover this
[49:05] digital um scarcity and and everything
[49:09] what what Bitcoin is but now is it is
[49:13] our time for women because we have
[49:16] different kind of skills we are more
[49:20] emotional we are more okay I rather
[49:22] don't go into it why we are different
[49:24] with men because it's obvious
[49:27] but this is our huge task now to put
[49:31] things in different
[49:33] perspective and this is my perspective
[49:36] to to make people understand life on a
[49:41] on a on a financial fundament for now
[49:45] let's say so just to understand the
[49:48] system and if they do that they're going
[49:50] to have plenty of questions I'm
[49:53] sure and you will find the answer
[49:57] if you start to uh uh study
[50:01] Bitcoin not all the questions will be
[50:03] answered but plenty of questions can be
[50:06] answered
[50:08] for these uh questions with Bitcoin so
[50:12] yeah and learn read read read read read
[50:16] read there's so many good books so many
[50:19] my appeal was Kuts book and that why
[50:22] that's why I was uh the first one what
[50:24] we translated because for me Swan holm's
[50:27] book The sovereignity and Independence
[50:30] and I I don't know if you have ever read
[50:32] it if you don't please read it it's a
[50:34] wonderful uh uh Masterpiece and it's not
[50:38] from the technical aspect of Bitcoin
[50:41] it's more like the society the people
[50:44] obviously Finance finances uh but how
[50:47] governments how the society
[50:50] Works what is the approach of money uh
[50:53] what for we use the money what is the
[50:57] whole idea of money and these are so
[50:59] basic questions but I'm not sure that if
[51:01] I would just ask a random person on the
[51:04] street would answer could could answer
[51:07] it because they never think about these
[51:09] kind of questions and also uh what is
[51:14] also an interesting thing for me that
[51:16] money has been always uh taboo we don't
[51:20] talk about money when I was a child I
[51:22] remember that the adults around me when
[51:24] they were started um to talk about money
[51:27] they were always started their voice
[51:31] down you know because it's like a secret
[51:33] we don't talk about money come on why
[51:37] why we don't talk about money and I and
[51:39] I also remember that oh it's not it's
[51:41] not for children you don't need to know
[51:44] about that children why why would they
[51:47] deal with
[51:48] money and I have two young
[51:53] boys the three years old already knows
[51:55] about Bitcoin obviously doesn't
[51:57] understand but he knows about Bitcoin I
[52:01] can't talk to him about Bitcoin
[52:03] obviously in his language I'm I'm I'm
[52:05] not into starting Bitcoin mining to him
[52:09] but obviously on his level the older one
[52:12] he's
[52:13] eight and he's he was with us on in in
[52:17] Madera he was watching Michael Sor
[52:20] talking he didn't understand a single
[52:22] word but he experienced the vibe the
[52:25] people and I have Goosebumps now as I'm
[52:27] talking you know because I saw his eyes
[52:30] and he was like oh Mommy
[52:32] what he he he just he just felt it you
[52:35] know that this is something big and this
[52:37] is my task for my children for the
[52:41] people around me for for the women for
[52:44] the mothers for my colleagues to spread
[52:48] the word and one by one they will get
[52:51] peed all of them if it's in my hand they
[52:54] will
[52:58] I'm quite successful in this so it it
[53:01] sounds like a
[53:03] threat yes it is what I do lately is
[53:07] like um I tell every I ask first do you
[53:11] have blink wallet because one of one of
[53:14] our fellow bitcoiner is he's um he's a
[53:17] developer of the company Hungarian gy so
[53:20] we we all have the blink
[53:22] wallet and I and I asked them do you
[53:24] have blink wallet do you know what is
[53:26] Blink wallet I don't even mention
[53:28] Bitcoin no no blink wallet what is it I
[53:31] make them download once they download it
[53:34] I send some send them some Bitcoin like
[53:37] 10 20 30 depends on you
[53:41] know how much they deserve
[53:44] it 10 20 30 uh Euros not not
[53:49] Bitcoins
[53:52] no and uh and then I just wait you know
[53:56] and and uh and most of them are calling
[53:58] me back oh you send me and then you know
[54:01] the the the price will start to move
[54:04] obviously when it's down no one calls me
[54:07] but when it goes up oh oh you sent me
[54:10] that much of money I didn't know I said
[54:11] no I didn't send that much of money I'm
[54:13] sorry so then we can start to talk about
[54:16] Bitcoin actually and they they they got
[54:20] interested you know so after I tend to
[54:25] send book
[54:27] uh
[54:28] articles uh it's an abuse
[54:31] though no I'm just joking obviously if
[54:34] someone doesn't want I don't do it I'm
[54:36] not crazy totally but uh but yeah my
[54:40] friends are almost all in Bitcoin it's
[54:44] it's it's hard because um like obviously
[54:47] as Bitcoin as we know um what direction
[54:51] we are going what direction the feeld
[54:52] system is going and what direction
[54:54] Bitcoin is going and then then you see
[54:56] person that you love uh that doesn't get
[54:59] Bitcoin and doesn't want to get Bitcoin
[55:01] uh and they're all in fear like you you
[55:05] have a really huge incentive to push it
[55:09] down the Thro exactly caringly
[55:12] lovingly but but uh you you you you do
[55:16] it out of love and not because you want
[55:19] to put them on on the same side as you
[55:22] are but because you know at some point
[55:25] they really will need it so I think it's
[55:29] um it's something good like orange
[55:30] building is something good but we also
[55:32] have to
[55:33] be careful to not uh shock people like
[55:38] like they they should come on on a
[55:41] little bit on their own terms at least
[55:43] that's what my uh I mean I talk so much
[55:46] about Bitcoin that's everywhere where I
[55:48] go um even in families like usually
[55:51] Bitcoin comes up just because I'm in the
[55:53] room I'm not even talking about it so uh
[55:56] that's that's an advantage of being so
[55:58] vocal about Bitcoin uh on social media
[56:01] with friends and stuff like that that it
[56:03] just comes up I was on a uh I'm now in
[56:06] Vienna I was back in Lind in another
[56:08] city in Austria and I met a lot of old
[56:11] friends there and it was it was so funny
[56:15] the the when I came after a while people
[56:19] starting to talk here about Bitcoin and
[56:22] there about Bitcoin because first I
[56:24] talked there about Bitcoin with them and
[56:25] then he and like the whole table all of
[56:27] the sudden talked about Bitcoin and I
[56:29] was like I I did not start any of the
[56:30] talks but they asked me about it so like
[56:34] I think we we have to be those those
[56:36] orange digital soldiers uh digital
[56:38] soldiers Orange um Bitcoin soldiers uh
[56:42] and just like be there if if they have
[56:44] questions and kind of just like put put
[56:48] Bitcoin in their lives like like just so
[56:51] they have an association to it and if
[56:54] they are interested they will call you
[56:56] they will text you uh and giving them
[56:58] some Bitcoin is really cool because then
[57:00] they experience that and that it's
[57:02] actually easy it's it's not like oh how
[57:05] I do I even do it no that's then the
[57:09] question is out of the way you just like
[57:11] have an app oh there's Bitcoin I have
[57:13] Bitcoin it's super easy I just got it it
[57:15] took me two minutes to download the app
[57:17] it took me one minute to get money it's
[57:19] super easy it is way easier than a bank
[57:21] account that's also something that I
[57:23] heard is like oh my bank account it was
[57:25] opened after week Bitcoin I got after
[57:27] three minutes on the Sunday evening
[57:29] exactly exactly so that that's that's I
[57:32] think that's um orange pilling I think
[57:34] will get easier and easier as the fear
[57:37] system gets worse and
[57:39] worse that's it I I used to be more
[57:42] violandoo years back uh aggressively
[57:46] peeling obviously I learned the lesson
[57:49] when no one wanted to talk to me anymore
[57:52] I was like okay there must be something
[57:54] wrong but nowadays as I said if I'm
[57:58] there Bitcoin will come up just to
[58:01] mention that oh you are in Bitcoin yes
[58:04] whatever doesn't matter how they mention
[58:06] it but then the discussion can be
[58:09] started if they want I don't force it
[58:12] anymore but people know where I am where
[58:15] I'm found so they can just contact and
[58:19] uh we can talk that's it and I think
[58:21] this is my task for now I'm part of the
[58:25] silent Revolution and by now I'm trying
[58:27] to be as silent as I can because now is
[58:30] the time for for silence you know cuz I
[58:35] seeded uh I put my seeds in the
[58:38] soil and now I'm just waiting for them
[58:41] to grow and
[58:43] [Laughter]
[58:45] harvest Ah that's that's great really
[58:48] cool um uh at the end of the podcast I
[58:51] usually have like one question that is
[58:53] for every guest and one question that
[58:55] comes from the previous guest but today
[58:57] those two questions are not the same but
[59:00] very similar so I will condense it down
[59:02] to one question uh and not ask you
[59:05] almost the same question twice um the
[59:08] the question is what is the biggest live
[59:11] lesson you ever learned besides Bitcoin
[59:13] so something that you can share with the
[59:15] audience that has nothing with the to do
[59:17] with Bitcoin H very good
[59:20] question so what is the biggest lesson I
[59:23] learned through Bitcoin but not about
[59:26] Bitcoin it doesn't have to be from
[59:28] Bitcoin like it it's like just like
[59:30] something you learn from life I think
[59:33] Simplicity Simplicity is one of one of
[59:36] the biggest lesson I learned and
[59:39] um relates also to
[59:42] bitcoin relates to those things what I
[59:46] said uh obviously this comes from my
[59:50] personality because I I I always when I
[59:53] start something I always see these
[59:56] huge task to fulfill and the the same
[60:00] happened to me with Bitcoin but as I
[60:04] said at the beginning or in the
[60:07] middle you don't need to see Bitcoin as
[60:12] something very uh difficult and very uh
[60:18] complex and this is also true for life
[60:21] I'm 45 so I have a bit of
[60:24] experience and and and everything has to
[60:27] be very simple and I experienced
[60:30] everything very simple you know and and
[60:34] basically this is the thing with with
[60:36] Bitcoin and that's why I said freedom
[60:38] and
[60:40] simplicity because if you don't make it
[60:43] if you don't listen to the word the
[60:46] outside word we live in nowadays
[60:49] everything is so
[60:51] complicated uh everything is so um uh uh
[60:56] layered and and it seems that you only
[60:59] need to uh just to go to work take your
[61:04] uh credits get your home get your car
[61:08] and die obviously pay everything back
[61:11] and die and with Bitcoin something else
[61:15] opened up for me which is very very
[61:19] simple a very simple life and that's why
[61:23] I encourage everyone to learn about
[61:25] Bitcoin to
[61:27] experience the simple beauty of life
[61:32] that's beautiful I love that a lot I
[61:33] think Simplicity is uh something that I
[61:36] kind of have to do with the podcast
[61:38] because I do so many of them I have to
[61:40] keep the process as
[61:43] simple perfect then yeah thank you so
[61:45] much before I let you go uh where can
[61:47] people find you DM you read more about
[61:49] you uh actually everything is in
[61:51] Hungarian so I wouldn't suggest
[61:56] because most of my stuff is in Hungarian
[61:58] for now
[62:00] so so yeah but uh at Bitcoin Bish and uh
[62:04] and also u a 21 group um and now the
[62:09] book is coming but it will be also in
[62:11] Hungarian so and I don't really want to
[62:14] uh also to expose myself as I said I'm
[62:17] just one of the Bitcoin PLS I'm just
[62:19] doing my my job you know I it's my duty
[62:24] I just wanted to search how many
[62:26] Hungarian listeners I have I never
[62:28] searched that interesting but uh YouTube
[62:32] doesn't give me Hungary maybe it's so
[62:35] less they don't even show it to me no no
[62:39] wait uh T no it's not in the in the
[62:43] first top 50 countries so uh this is
[62:47] what I'm talking about I still have
[62:48] plenty of job to do you you definitely
[62:51] have plenty of of of job to do yeah
[62:54] definitely uh yeah absolutely and it's
[62:57] fascinating it's actually not on the in
[62:58] the top 50 then YouTube doesn't show it
[63:01] uh I would have to export the the Excel
[63:04] file now to to see the the top 500 and
[63:07] there is probably all of them in there
[63:09] because they have 500 countries probably
[63:12] let shout out to the to the five people
[63:14] that watch from Hungary right
[63:17] now that's that's great yeah then thank
[63:19] you so much k for for being on thank you
[63:21] so much for taking the time also thank
[63:23] you so much and for everyone that is
