[00:00] The large institutions are purchasing
[00:03] Bitcoin at kind of an insane rate to be
[00:05] honest, especially strategy. They went
[00:07] from 200,000 Bitcoin to over 500,000
[00:11] Bitcoin extremely quickly. Bitcoin
[00:13] doesn't work the same way as gold or the
[00:16] US dollar. Centralizing it and putting
[00:18] all the keys in control of one custodian
[00:21] or entity is just categorically less
[00:24] secure than leveraging the native
[00:26] properties of Bitcoin. multi- signature
[00:29] with keys distributed and we crossed
[00:31] that pivotal price of $100,000 US which
[00:36] even just a few years ago seemed like a
[00:38] pipe dream. You know, I would tell
[00:39] people that I was meeting, oh yeah, I
[00:41] think Bitcoin's going to cross $100,000.
[00:42] And they would they would look at me
[00:44] like I was crazy. I've been in Bitcoin
[00:45] for quite a while, but it just feels
[00:47] like this year in particular, it's very
[00:50] true because of how optimistic the
[00:53] future is for Bitcoin.
[00:57] [Music]
[01:00] Hi, Phil. Thanks for being on again.
[01:02] Robin, I'm so happy to be back. Really,
[01:05] really cool to have you on. Um uh I I've
[01:09] I've thought a lot about what I should
[01:11] ask guests that have been on again uh
[01:14] for the first question and I actually
[01:15] got some really cool um feedback from
[01:18] the community because I asked that
[01:20] question last time I had someone on
[01:21] again. Uh and they came up with like
[01:24] five good questions but I want to keep
[01:25] it with just one uh to to not use too
[01:28] many too much time there. Uh, and the
[01:31] most interesting one I found was since
[01:34] you last been on the podcast, what have
[01:37] you learned from Bitcoin? Uh, and I
[01:40] think you have been on about a year ago,
[01:43] something like that. Well, in the last
[01:44] year, Bitcoin has changed really
[01:47] dramatically in the US at least. So,
[01:51] since the last time we were on, you
[01:53] know, a US strategic Bitcoin reserve was
[01:55] established. Ross Olrich was freed from
[01:57] prison. Uh Donald Trump of course was
[01:59] reelected president and we crossed that
[02:03] pivotal price of $100,000 US which even
[02:08] just a few years ago seemed like a pipe
[02:10] dream. You know I would tell people that
[02:12] I was meeting, oh yeah, I think
[02:13] Bitcoin's going to cross $100,000 and
[02:15] they would they would look at me like I
[02:17] was crazy. now, uh, they definitely
[02:21] don't look at me, uh, with that same
[02:24] type of skepticism and and I've had to
[02:26] revise my my pitch and say, "Yeah, I
[02:28] think Bitcoin is going to go to a
[02:29] million one day." Um, so the question
[02:32] was, what have I learned about Bitcoin?
[02:35] And I think the the thing that I've
[02:38] learned the most over the last year is
[02:40] just that Bitcoin never does what you
[02:44] expect it to do. And
[02:46] maybe, you know, I've learned that I've
[02:48] been in Bitcoin for quite a while, but
[02:50] it just feels like this year in
[02:52] particular, it's very true because of
[02:56] how optimistic the future is for
[02:59] Bitcoin, you know, with all these things
[03:01] that
[03:02] have transpired, uh, micro, you know,
[03:06] strategy hitting 500,000 Bitcoin, US
[03:09] strategic Bitcoin reserve established,
[03:11] the operation, you know, chokepoint
[03:14] things kind falling to the wayside in
[03:16] the
[03:17] US. I would expect the price to be a lot
[03:20] higher and you know it's it's been uh a
[03:22] muted cycle so far although it has
[03:25] crossed that pivotal $100,000 price. So
[03:30] maybe that's not, you know, the most uh
[03:33] uh, you know, prophetic or um, profound
[03:37] thing that I've learned, but it's always
[03:40] surprising that just Bitcoin never does
[03:42] what I anticipated to do. Yeah, it's
[03:45] super uh, and just because you said it,
[03:47] I thought about it. Um, when I last year
[03:50] started, I I had a space running uh,
[03:53] where bit where a sailor with with
[03:56] strategy B or micro strategy back then.
[03:58] um still had under 210,000 Bitcoin and
[04:02] we were like, "Oh, will he get to like
[04:04] this 1% of the supply and and then like
[04:06] we I don't know, maybe he'll get there
[04:08] this year." And it's so fascinating to
[04:12] see just his execution uh and these new
[04:15] ways of coming up with buying Bitcoin
[04:17] and now like this crossing 500,000 uh
[04:21] Bitcoin on on the balance sheet. It's
[04:23] unbelievable uh uh actually for me and
[04:27] it kind of shows how this cycle is like
[04:30] really big on institutions and retail at
[04:34] least what from what I see maybe you
[04:36] have other insights from from Unchained
[04:38] um uh retail is kind of sleeping on on
[04:41] this cycle. I definitely notice that the
[04:45] general public is still very asleep when
[04:47] it comes to Bitcoin.
[04:50] On the Unchained side of the house,
[04:51] we've surpassed some really major
[04:53] milestones in the last year. So,
[04:56] Unchained helps uh long-term Bitcoin
[04:58] savers secure, manage, and grow their
[05:00] Bitcoin with a suite of financial
[05:01] services that are built on top of
[05:03] collaborative custody multi- signature
[05:05] where clients control keys. And just in
[05:07] the last year, we sa surpassed 100,000
[05:10] Bitcoin secured on the platform and over
[05:14] 900 million US of commercial loans uh
[05:17] originated. So, some really major
[05:19] milestones that have uh we've crossed
[05:22] and you know, we help thousands and
[05:24] thousands and thousands of clients. So,
[05:26] our client count has definitely grown a
[05:29] lot. But I I do agree with
[05:32] you that, you know, if you're walking
[05:35] down the street, Bitcoin is still
[05:37] regarded, you know, people know about
[05:39] Bitcoin at this point, but there's
[05:41] definitely still that skepticism or
[05:43] there's a lack of interest. And I'm not
[05:46] sure what it is that will peique their
[05:48] interest. I thought crossing $100,000
[05:50] would have definitely moved the needle,
[05:52] but and you know, we did see a decent
[05:55] bump in new users when that milestone
[05:58] was crossed. But now that we're, you
[06:01] know, 20% lower, um, I'm very surprised
[06:05] that we're not seeing more volumes. And
[06:07] volumes are good, but they're not, you
[06:09] know, it's not like a major bull run
[06:11] volume. People that watch my podcast all
[06:13] the time might might be bored of of that
[06:15] statistics, but I bring it up a lot. Uh
[06:18] I really like to see uh at Google Trends
[06:21] like with a search term buy Bitcoin and
[06:23] and see how it has been developing. And
[06:26] if you just compare that to 2021 and
[06:29] especially 2017, uh we are crazy low
[06:33] like 7% of where we were with uh
[06:35] December 2017. Then people bring up
[06:38] like, oh, nobody's searching anything
[06:40] anymore. But yeah, they look YouTube and
[06:42] actually it does make a difference if
[06:44] you look at the YouTube volume and
[06:46] YouTube is the biggest video platform
[06:48] currently. Um, it is a little bit better
[06:52] uh where where we currently are. Uh
[06:54] would be super fun also to see
[06:57] statistics of like JBD and other EI
[06:59] tools that kind of come up with like but
[07:01] they don't have that that history of
[07:03] data. Um but it just shows me that the
[07:07] price currently is mostly driven at
[07:11] least what I see um from institutions uh
[07:15] and retail at least also from my like um
[07:19] uh when I go out in the family where
[07:22] there's no Bitcoiner they really don't
[07:24] care that Bitcoin hit 100k like they
[07:26] they ah hit the new alltime high we we
[07:29] have seen it before we heard it before
[07:30] we we still think it's bad for the
[07:32] environment
[07:34] Right. And I think
[07:37] uh the last time we we recorded either
[07:39] the ETFs had just released or they were
[07:42] just about to be released. And so yeah,
[07:44] it's a totally different paradigm right
[07:47] now for Bitcoin. And I completely agree
[07:50] with you. The large institutions are
[07:53] purchasing Bitcoin at kind of an insane
[07:56] rate to be honest, especially strategy.
[07:59] They went from 200,000 Bitcoin to over
[08:02] 500,000 Bitcoin extremely quickly. Um,
[08:06] and something that kind of keeps me up
[08:08] at night is all of these major
[08:11] institutions
[08:13] accumulating with quite uh a serious
[08:16] centralization of custodians, right? So,
[08:20] most of the ETFs in the US use Coinbase
[08:23] for custody. Coinbase is becoming a
[08:26] larger and larger and larger honeypot
[08:29] for attackers.
[08:32] And you know, regardless of how amazing
[08:35] their security is, just having a single
[08:37] place that you can go and compromise to
[08:39] cause a catastrophic loss of Bitcoin is
[08:42] becoming, I think, a growing concern for
[08:44] me. Is it a concern for the price action
[08:50] or actually also for Bitcoin itself?
[08:52] Bitcoin will survive either way and in
[08:55] fact Bitcoin will emerge stronger uh if
[09:00] large centralized custodians are uh
[09:03] attacked and compromised
[09:05] because alternative solutions like a
[09:08] network of keys you know collaborative
[09:10] custody multi-IG self custody become
[09:13] more and more obvious and once those are
[09:17] adopted Bitcoin becomes even more
[09:20] antifragile so Bitcoin I think it just
[09:22] in general is a very anti-fragile form
[09:25] of money where any sort of attacks might
[09:28] cause a you know might cause damage in
[09:31] the short term or slow adoption but the
[09:35] people who stick it out and
[09:37] survive end up getting much more
[09:40] resilient and stronger. So even if you
[09:43] know the largest custodians are
[09:46] attacked, I think it will set Bitcoin's
[09:49] adoption back a little bit, but Bitcoin
[09:52] will grow much stronger as a result of
[09:55] it. Because every
[09:57] time a custodian like that runs into an
[10:00] issue, it teaches the market something
[10:02] really important that hey, Bitcoin
[10:04] doesn't work the same way as gold or the
[10:08] US dollar. centralizing it and putting
[10:11] all the keys in control of one custodian
[10:14] or entity is
[10:16] just categorically less secure than
[10:20] leveraging the native properties of
[10:22] Bitcoin multi- signature with keys
[10:25] distributed. If keys were more
[10:27] distributed among different custodians,
[10:29] even if the individual himself isn't
[10:31] holding a key, then if exchange A is
[10:35] hacked and their key is compromised,
[10:37] zero Bitcoin is lost, right? Compare
[10:40] that to today. If an exchange is
[10:42] attacked and compromised, significant
[10:44] funds are lost. you know, just a month
[10:46] or so ago, Bybit was hacked for $1.5
[10:50] billion of it was uh Ethereum, but it
[10:55] just goes to show that centralizing
[10:57] control of keys with a third party is
[11:00] not the ideal long-term solution for
[11:03] Bitcoin security.
[11:05] Yeah. And from what I uh I don't know if
[11:08] this actually true and I never checked
[11:09] it, but I saw it in a news where they uh
[11:12] converted it to Bitcoin. There was this
[11:14] like joke going on like even criminals
[11:16] know you steal Ethereum but you actually
[11:18] want the Bitcoin not the not the
[11:20] Ethereum. Yeah, criminals need money as
[11:22] well. Everybody needs money. Governments
[11:25] need money. People need money.
[11:27] Unfortunately, criminals also need
[11:29] money. Um, and yeah, I do think I mean
[11:33] it makes sense that uh they would get
[11:35] rid of something that is hemorrhaging
[11:38] value measured in Bitcoin um and
[11:41] upgraded to the world's best form of
[11:43] money. You know, while they're
[11:46] nefarious, they're not idiots, right?
[11:49] Um, so they know what they're doing and
[11:51] of course they're going to want to store
[11:52] that value in the world's best form of
[11:54] money.
[11:56] One thing that uh I didn't plan but uh
[11:58] it's super interesting uh when we look
[12:00] at uh self custody uh and in Unchained
[12:04] is is doing uh self- custody uh with
[12:07] with their clients. Where do you think
[12:09] we will end up long term? I I don't know
[12:12] if we actually talked about it last
[12:14] time, but it's super interesting because
[12:16] um I have a really hard time convincing
[12:19] people of self-custody. both of my
[12:21] channel around 50% of my channel is
[12:23] doing self-custody 50% not uh but even
[12:26] more problem problematic is like if I
[12:29] get people to get buy bitcoin in in real
[12:32] life like friends and families uh they
[12:35] they feel really safe if they are
[12:37] exchanges they trust in the institutions
[12:40] uh like it's Austria like uh they they
[12:43] never experienced bank freeze or
[12:46] anything like that they they trust in
[12:47] the institutions and the governments
[12:49] that are in place uh which I think is
[12:52] not a clever idea but uh it's hard to
[12:55] convince someone of something else. Do
[12:58] you think self custody is something that
[13:01] can be mainstream of like okay over 50%
[13:05] of users will do it um or is it always
[13:09] for a side group of people that really
[13:13] want to enhance their their own freedom
[13:16] and their sovereignty? There's a lot to
[13:18] unpack in that question. So what I'll
[13:20] start with is by saying that even today
[13:24] a vast majority of all of the Bitcoin
[13:28] out there that isn't lost is secured in
[13:31] self-custody. So last time I checked
[13:34] there was an estimated something 3 or 4
[13:36] million Bitcoin with
[13:39] custodians. There's about 10 million
[13:42] Bitcoin 10 to 12 million Bitcoin secured
[13:44] in self-custody and then you know 3 to 4
[13:47] million Bitcoin are lost. So, not going
[13:49] to do math on the fly here, but that
[13:51] equals roughly 20 million. Um, and I
[13:54] think that surprises people. Most
[13:56] Bitcoin out there is under the control
[14:00] of, you know, an individual's private
[14:02] keys. So, if you if you you know, when
[14:06] you get started, it looks the easiest to
[14:09] just set up an account with an exchange
[14:11] because then you don't really have to
[14:12] learn anything, right? With your bank
[14:15] account. uh you just upload your
[14:18] information, they deal with all of the
[14:21] dollars or
[14:22] euros, gold, whatever you're securing
[14:24] with the bank, and you don't have to
[14:26] worry too much. Now, with Bitcoin, it's
[14:30] very problematic because Bitcoin is
[14:33] immutable, which means that if Bitcoin
[14:35] is sent to an address, there's no
[14:37] takebacks.
[14:38] And when you set up an account with an
[14:40] exchange, the most common way that
[14:42] people lose Bitcoin is by having their
[14:46] access to their account hacked. So if
[14:49] you're using an email address that, you
[14:52] know, gets
[14:53] compromised, what attackers can do is
[14:56] get access to your email and then trick
[14:59] the exchange to send Bitcoin. you know,
[15:02] log in to the exchange, uh, withdraw
[15:04] Bitcoin or go through support channels
[15:07] and set up email kind of routing rules
[15:10] that send all the replies to a folder
[15:12] that you might not be aware of. And they
[15:14] can spend months and months doing that.
[15:16] So, while setting up an account with an
[15:18] exchange might seem easy, what you're
[15:20] actually securing your Bitcoin with when
[15:22] you do that is your email account. So,
[15:23] your email account better be extremely
[15:26] secure. Now, another way, you know,
[15:28] that's that's one of the risks of
[15:29] working with an exchange. Another risk
[15:30] is the exchange themselves gets
[15:32] compromised which happens every probably
[15:35] every year probably multiple times every
[15:37] year uh in in different you know
[15:40] exchanges across different exchanges in
[15:42] in different you know especially in DeFi
[15:45] kind of fantasy land those are super
[15:48] insecure but majorians also run into
[15:52] problems and so it's almost like a
[15:54] matter of time when it comes to custody
[15:56] and so as as long as your you know as
[15:58] soon as your Bitcoin gets to a point
[15:59] where it's an amount that you really
[16:01] can't afford to lose. I really think you
[16:03] must look into self custody. And there
[16:06] are ways to do it that are pretty
[16:09] straightforward. You know, you can set
[16:10] up a a mobile wallet on your phone, but
[16:13] what you really want to look at for
[16:15] long-term savings is cold storage, which
[16:17] is, you know, either with a hardware
[16:18] wallet or with collaborative custody,
[16:20] which is multi- signature. Uh, and
[16:22] multi- signature is Bitcoin addresses
[16:24] that are built from multiple keys that
[16:26] require multiple keys to spend. So for
[16:28] example, two of three. That's what we do
[16:31] at
[16:32] Unchained. The Bitcoin address is built
[16:34] with three keys. Any two of which are
[16:36] needed to move the Bitcoin out of the
[16:38] address. Clients control two of the
[16:40] keys. Unchained has one of the keys. So
[16:42] if you lose one of your devices, then
[16:45] Unchained is there to step in to to sign
[16:47] a transaction. And we found that that is
[16:50] an extremely resilient way to store
[16:53] Bitcoin for many years. While the setup
[16:56] might be a little bit more complicated
[16:58] than setting up an account with an
[16:59] exchange, it's really not that bad. Um,
[17:02] Unchain guides clients through it day in
[17:04] and day out, every age, every technical
[17:07] ability. Uh, we've worked with clients
[17:09] in their 80s. We've worked with younger
[17:11] clients. We've worked with, you know,
[17:12] self-professed uh, lites, right? People
[17:14] who don't know how to use technology.
[17:17] And at the end of the day, if you can if
[17:20] you can protect information decently
[17:23] well, like if you have a filing cabinet
[17:25] that you store your uh in the US, we
[17:27] have social security numbers and
[17:29] passports, uh then you have a good
[17:32] chance of being able to successfully
[17:34] secure a key. It just requires, you
[17:37] know, a little bit of of learning. Um
[17:40] but if Bitcoin is really important to
[17:43] you, it's some of the most valuable
[17:45] learning that you can do. I like to tell
[17:46] people that it's easier than driving a
[17:48] car. Driving a car, there's a lot going
[17:51] on. There's a lot of rules. You're
[17:52] driving a piece of heavy equipment that
[17:55] could, you know, malfunction. Uh you
[17:57] could crash. With Bitcoin, you're
[17:59] writing down some words. You're storing
[18:02] those in a very secure place. And if
[18:05] you're using hardware wallets, you want
[18:06] to be doing kind of routine maintenance
[18:09] checks. So, couple times a year,
[18:10] plugging it in, making sure all the
[18:12] Bitcoin's there, making sure your device
[18:13] is up to date. really not that
[18:15] challenging once you get over the
[18:17] learning curve. I want to I I couldn't
[18:20] agree more like we we do so many things
[18:23] that we didn't expect it like even um
[18:26] even on a technical side how how few
[18:31] people knew what an email is, how to
[18:33] login, the password and usernames uh how
[18:36] we use WhatsApp. uh all those things are
[18:39] learning curves for humanity and I do
[18:42] hope actually on on a larger scale that
[18:44] uh uh the the private the public private
[18:49] key the crypto cryptography of it um
[18:54] hopefully gets to be more widely used. I
[18:57] think username and password is kind of a
[19:00] bad thing for security wise and and I
[19:03] would like to just use it in many more
[19:07] places. Just just a quick side uh
[19:10] questions. Are you also doing three out
[19:11] of five and if if not why?
[19:15] We currently only do two out of three
[19:17] multi-IG and it's for a very specific
[19:19] reason. Um, when we get clients set up,
[19:22] clients, like I said, have two keys, but
[19:25] each key is actually comprised of a
[19:28] hardware wallet and a seed phrase,
[19:30] right? So, as a client, you have four
[19:32] items. Unchain has one item. Um, you can
[19:36] lose three out of four of those items
[19:39] and still recover your Bitcoin. So, you
[19:41] can lose both seed phrase and a device
[19:44] and as long as you have one device, you
[19:46] can still recover your Bitcoin. We
[19:48] believe that securing seed phrases is
[19:50] foundational to Bitcoin security. So for
[19:54] every key that you have, you want to
[19:55] have a device and a seed phrase. And
[19:58] that's because the hardware wallets
[20:00] themselves are points of failure. We've
[20:02] seen many times throughout the past
[20:04] where a firmware update goes wrong or um
[20:08] the manufacturer, you know, introduces a
[20:10] new feature that is not compatible where
[20:12] people might be locked out of signing
[20:15] transactions for a period of time. If
[20:17] you have that seed phrase, you can just
[20:18] load that seed phrase onto another
[20:20] device and be on your way. If you don't
[20:22] have a seed phrase, you're trapped. You
[20:24] have to wait until the functionality is
[20:27] available. So, two of three is where we
[20:30] landed because again, clients are
[20:32] securing four items. If we were to
[20:35] increase that to three of five, it would
[20:37] just increase complexity pretty
[20:39] significantly. Uh because you do need to
[20:42] or you do want to geographically
[20:44] separate as many of those items as
[20:46] possible. And finding four separate
[20:48] locations is already tough and then
[20:51] increasing that um maybe with another
[20:55] two keys if you want to hold four out of
[20:57] five keys for example uh just makes it
[20:59] even harder. Yeah, it totally makes
[21:01] sense. Especially with the the the seed
[21:03] phrase backup. It's then already almost
[21:07] like a five out of uh uh two setup
[21:11] because like you need uh just uh one of
[21:13] two of those uh where yeah, you only
[21:17] have two keys uh but like you have of
[21:20] one key, two different items that can
[21:22] actually unlock either the hardware
[21:25] wallet with the pin or the uh seat
[21:27] phrase on its own. uh then it makes a
[21:30] lot of uh sense. Um there's I would say
[21:34] there's there's some marginable marginal
[21:36] additional security that you can get
[21:37] from three to five but that additional
[21:39] security comes with pretty significant
[21:42] additional operational complexity right
[21:45] uh because you are having to find more
[21:47] secure locations and then you have to
[21:49] periodically check on everything. You
[21:50] can't just like set Bitcoin and forget
[21:52] it. Um, so you do want to make sure that
[21:56] at least once or twice a year you're
[21:58] going and checking to make sure that you
[22:00] haven't been compromised. With multi-
[22:02] signature, if one item is compromised,
[22:04] it's not a big deal. You're not losing
[22:06] Bitcoin, but you do need to know so that
[22:08] you can move the Bitcoin into a new
[22:10] address where all of the items are safe.
[22:13] A lot of sense. Um uh the thing that I
[22:16] wanted to I was I was sidetracked by
[22:19] myself. Uh I wanted to get to uh towards
[22:22] there's so much going on currently and
[22:24] there's so much new things coming up
[22:26] with like the ETFs. We have the second
[22:28] year of the ETF now the strategic
[22:30] bitcoin reserve institutions I'm now
[22:32] buying uh more and more uh not just like
[22:35] more companies but they seem to be also
[22:37] like going heavily and heavilier in
[22:39] there. GameStop uh is now one one fun
[22:43] new addition uh to that. Uh where do you
[22:46] see the the Bitcoin adoption headed in
[22:48] in the next couple of of years just
[22:51] looking at the uh sheer amount of uh
[22:54] institutional adoption that seems to be
[22:56] unlocked now. More and more companies
[22:58] are going to have to adopt Bitcoin. I
[23:01] think what they're realizing is that
[23:04] once you account for the money printing,
[23:06] their uh stock performance or their
[23:09] performance overall as a company is not
[23:12] uh not nearly as good as it might look
[23:14] on paper. Um the same thing goes with
[23:18] countries though. I think I'm a little
[23:19] surprised
[23:20] that another country hasn't publicly
[23:23] announced since the US uh announced the
[23:26] strategic Bitcoin reserve. I know that
[23:28] they're out there and I know that many
[23:29] countries are working on it, but that's
[23:33] absolutely going to happen because
[23:35] that's how the game theory plays out.
[23:37] You know, Iran isn't going to sit there
[23:39] and let the US accumulate all the
[23:41] Bitcoin. Russia isn't going to sit there
[23:43] and let the US accumulate all the
[23:45] Bitcoin. And then, you know, if if
[23:47] countries that are uh maybe antagonistic
[23:50] to the US start doing it, then other
[23:52] allies are going to start to accumulate
[23:54] Bitcoin. It's just it's how it all plays
[23:56] out. um all all countries again
[23:58] everybody needs money and uh bitcoin is
[24:01] the best form of money so every country
[24:04] will eventually adopt
[24:05] it I I I do do like that a lot everyone
[24:09] needs money and bitcoin is just the best
[24:10] option for it and it's just a matter of
[24:12] time till every individual every nation
[24:16] state every company every whatever you
[24:18] want to count there will get the
[24:21] companies you like the companies you
[24:22] hate the countries you like the
[24:24] countries you hate uh they will all
[24:27] ultimately end up adopting it. Yeah,
[24:29] that's the bad that's the worst thing
[24:31] about Bitcoin. Your your enemies also
[24:33] might adopt it.
[24:36] That's right. It's it's uh it took me a
[24:40] while to kind of come to this, but it's
[24:41] you know, it's an unfortunate thing, but
[24:44] it's also maybe one of the most positive
[24:45] things about it is that it is a level
[24:47] playing field. It is neutral, and it has
[24:50] to be neutral in order for it to
[24:53] function. And
[24:55] so, you know, while people who, you
[24:58] know, maybe are using it for nefarious
[25:00] purposes also adopt Bitcoin, the amount
[25:04] of positivity and good that Bitcoin will
[25:06] do for the world vastly outweighs that.
[25:10] And Bitcoin has to work for the people
[25:13] who are criminals in order for it to
[25:15] work for everybody else. And I just
[25:18] believe that most people are
[25:20] well-intentioned and good. And once they
[25:23] have a good form of money, like massive
[25:26] amounts of prosperity will will happen.
[25:30] So interesting. Absolutely. Um uh one
[25:33] topic that is super interesting. Uh and
[25:36] uh I think it would be fun with you to
[25:39] talk about is when we get there, Bitcoin
[25:42] is the big driver of monetary uh energy.
[25:48] uh and and uh all the bitcoiners that
[25:51] are now earlier in uh have accumulated a
[25:54] lot of resources and maybe also like
[25:56] later stage because like humanity I
[25:59] think in itself gets wealthier with
[26:01] adopting bitcoin not only the the
[26:03] earlier ones uh is the question of like
[26:06] what are we bitcoiners are doing with
[26:09] those resources and I think you also
[26:11] have like a personal uh journey to to
[26:13] share well I think there's a saying you
[26:16] know fix the money fix the And it's
[26:18] something that I truly believe and for a
[26:21] lot of folks who have been in Bitcoin
[26:22] for a while who've been using Bitcoin as
[26:24] their primary source of savings. Uh
[26:26] there are new opportunities that have
[26:28] kind of emerged, right? You can not only
[26:31] just accumulate, you know, beautiful
[26:33] real estate or you know second pass
[26:36] courses and stuff for yourself and for
[26:37] your family, but you can also start to
[26:39] think about how do I want to impact the
[26:41] world, right? How do I want to improve
[26:44] things out there? And there are a lot of
[26:47] great organizations that are very
[26:49] Bitcoin aligned. So at Unchained, you
[26:53] know, I mentioned earlier we do
[26:54] financial services for bit for long-term
[26:56] Bitcoin savers built on top of that
[26:57] multi-stig collaborative custody that we
[26:59] were talking
[27:00] about. A few products that are are newer
[27:05] um that have been performing really well
[27:07] for Unchain and just for people are are
[27:10] tax advantaged accounts. So, IAS in the
[27:12] US, they're individual retirement
[27:14] accounts. Um, people can, you know, put
[27:18] dollars in to these before taxes have
[27:21] been taken out, before income tax, or
[27:23] you can pay taxes up front and put
[27:26] dollars into what's called a Roth IRA,
[27:28] and the Bitcoin can grow tax-free
[27:32] forever. These these moves are are
[27:35] really important when you're trying to
[27:37] think about, you know, how to optimize
[27:38] your tax position over the long term.
[27:41] And at the end of last year, we we
[27:44] released a brand new product uh called a
[27:46] donor adise fund, which is a charitable
[27:49] financial product um that pairs super
[27:51] nicely with the more traditional uh you
[27:54] know tax advantaged accounts. And the
[27:56] way it works is that if you, you know,
[27:59] have charitable intent, what you can do
[28:01] is you can donate Bitcoin into uh this
[28:04] donor advised fund, DAFF for short, you
[28:08] get a tax write off immediately for the
[28:10] full fair market value of the Bitcoin,
[28:14] assuming you know you qualify and you've
[28:15] worked with your tax professional to
[28:17] make sure that that's all good and good.
[28:19] Um and then you can pair that with uh
[28:22] large taxable events uh in your personal
[28:24] life or for example those tax advantaged
[28:26] accounts. So if you want to like move
[28:28] Bitcoin from a traditional IRA which
[28:31] taxes haven't been taken out, put it
[28:32] into a post tax Roth IRA uh where it can
[28:37] grow forever uh without tax uh capital
[28:41] gains. you can pair that move with a
[28:44] donation and not end up paying any
[28:49] additional taxes for those moves. So,
[28:50] there's a lot of like really cool tax
[28:53] optimization moves that you can do with
[28:55] the different products at Unchained.
[28:58] And what's great about this uh bitcoin
[29:01] daff donor adise fund is as I mentioned
[29:04] you you donate the bitcoin it sits there
[29:06] in this fund where it can grow taxfree
[29:10] and then over time you can make grants
[29:14] to different organizations of your
[29:17] choice in US dollars or in bitcoin. So,
[29:20] there's many great Bitcoin organizations
[29:23] around the world that you can grant
[29:26] Bitcoin to. And then for the
[29:28] organizations that are important to you,
[29:30] maybe that aren't ready for Bitcoin, I
[29:31] don't know, your church, your school, uh
[29:34] something like that, a big, you know,
[29:35] charity that you really enjoy that just
[29:37] doesn't accept Bitcoin yet. You can use
[29:39] this little charitable financial
[29:42] product, the DAFF, to hold Bitcoin on
[29:44] their behalf, right? So you donate
[29:45] Bitcoin this year, you get your write
[29:47] off. The Bitcoin sits there and it grows
[29:50] tax-free and then you can make grants to
[29:53] Bitcoin organizations and uh non-
[29:56] Bitcoin organizations or or orgs that
[29:58] aren't ready for Bitcoin yet. They can
[30:01] just receive dollars. So it's a super
[30:03] powerful tool and it's something that,
[30:04] you know, in my Bitcoin journey started
[30:06] to make more sense for me um this year.
[30:09] And it's been awesome being able to uh
[30:12] hold Bitcoin on on behalf of some of the
[30:15] organizations I care about and then also
[30:16] send Bitcoin to the really cool
[30:18] organizations out there that are
[30:19] promoting Bitcoin adoption. Um so not
[30:22] only do you get that, you know, tax
[30:24] write off. You're not paying uh in the
[30:26] US the IRS more than their share. Um but
[30:30] you're also using that money to
[30:32] accelerate Bitcoin itself.
[30:35] That's super interesting. Uh I mean
[30:37] that's a probably a US only thing I
[30:41] presume. I believe DAFFs are US only. Uh
[30:44] there may be uh interesting charitable
[30:47] financial products like that in Europe,
[30:49] but I'm not aware of. Let's take a break
[30:51] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[30:53] that Coin Vigilante has made with the
[30:56] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[30:59] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[31:02] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[31:05] and Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[31:07] completely new and amazing Genesis
[31:10] edition of their watch collections. You
[31:13] have the date of the first ever minded
[31:16] Bitcoin block in there and of course
[31:19] also the block height and which epoch we
[31:22] are currently in. I love the level of
[31:25] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[31:28] Make sure to check out those amazing
[31:30] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[31:33] descriptions. I love those watches. so
[31:35] so much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[31:38] really do hope that you don't have it on
[31:41] exchange. But if you do have it on
[31:42] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[31:44] deal with that. The first way is you put
[31:47] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[31:49] entry for you to get into the
[31:51] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[31:54] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[31:57] super simple and secure way. And if you
[32:00] check out the link in the description,
[32:02] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[32:05] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[32:08] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[32:11] partner in terms of how to get the most
[32:14] out of your sovereignty. They will
[32:17] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[32:20] that is perfect for your individual
[32:23] situation. They will show you how you
[32:25] can secure your own devices. Securing
[32:28] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[32:30] have to keep all your devices secure.
[32:32] One topic that is overlooked often is
[32:34] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[32:37] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[32:40] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[32:42] place already? And last but not least,
[32:44] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[32:46] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[32:49] plan B for all that. Head over to the
[32:54] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:57] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[33:00] be for the first time ever speaking at
[33:02] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[33:05] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[33:08] really looking forward to seeing all of
[33:10] you there. You can get your ticket in
[33:12] the link down in the description of
[33:14] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[33:16] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[33:20] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[33:22] there. But I think this the the point
[33:25] stands of
[33:27] like no matter what product, no matter
[33:30] how the method is is going to work and I
[33:34] think there will come um a lot of
[33:36] companies that that that will offer
[33:39] something like that all over the world.
[33:41] Um the the point uh is like Bitcoiners
[33:46] will have uh a lot of resources or or
[33:50] are already having a lot of resources
[33:52] but like it will only um go up from here
[33:55] as Bitcoin only goes up from here long
[33:58] term. uh and I'm really excited of where
[34:03] the world is going as uh the bitcoiners
[34:07] with the resources are influencing
[34:09] decision makers in the political space
[34:13] uh in in the in the in the donor space
[34:16] of like uh charable charitable uh uh
[34:19] foundations uh but also with like uh
[34:22] companies and and with with financial
[34:24] decisions on on the business sides. Uh
[34:27] it will be really really cool to see and
[34:30] this is kind of the the fix the money
[34:32] fix the world where uh we might actually
[34:35] go we have we fixed the incentives and
[34:38] we now have Bitcoin and and uh this
[34:42] could really influence the the world in
[34:44] a really interesting direction. I I do
[34:47] like that idea a lot. I really think we
[34:49] saw the influence of Bitcoin at least in
[34:52] the US during the US elections.
[34:55] Bitcoin has increased in value so much
[34:57] that some of the earliest adopters have
[35:00] very significant wealth. enough wealth
[35:03] that they can really impact change uh
[35:06] both politically as well as charitably
[35:08] or you know professionally even starting
[35:11] companies employing people and it's
[35:14] really cool to see uh now some of the
[35:17] ideals of Bitcoin are they're they're
[35:20] being pushed onto the general public
[35:23] just by way of of how much more
[35:26] prosperous the the average Bitcoiner is
[35:30] comparatively And now that, you know,
[35:33] it's like the the golden rule, right?
[35:35] Whoever has the gold makes the rules.
[35:37] So, the wealthier Bitcoiners are at this
[35:40] point, you know, trying they're they're
[35:42] they've accumulated such a massive
[35:44] position that they're looking for ways
[35:46] to impact the world. And you can do that
[35:49] again politically by getting uh Bitcoin
[35:52] aligned politicians elected, by helping,
[35:55] you know, for example, Trump win the
[35:58] election. um just by by essentially by
[36:02] him saying that he's not going to go
[36:04] after us, right? Uh whereas previously I
[36:07] think the previous administrations were
[36:09] a little bit more hostile, a little
[36:11] aggressive to people who were holding
[36:13] Bitcoin and uh I think that caused them
[36:16] ultimately to lose the election because
[36:18] it was such a massive single issue um
[36:21] for
[36:22] people. how uh I mean it's a different
[36:25] topic but uh how big uh because it's
[36:28] it's from a European standpoint it's
[36:31] always hard to say uh from the outside I
[36:34] I see the US only with Bitcoin classes
[36:36] on so uh I I only hear uh news from
[36:42] Bitcoiners
[36:43] uh so it's it's I I have a very filtered
[36:46] view of of the US um how big uh or not
[36:53] significant was that Trump actually won
[36:56] for for Bitcoin for the Bitcoin
[36:58] industry? Uh medium-term I mean
[37:01] long-term we we don't care but uh
[37:03] shortterm this can actually impact uh
[37:06] people how bad was it before uh and and
[37:08] how would you think it would have been
[37:11] different if if um Harris won. I try to
[37:14] avoid getting overly political, but what
[37:17] I will say is you can just pay attention
[37:18] to the SE SEC cases that have been
[37:21] dropped recently. Um there were a lot of
[37:24] them and most of them have been um
[37:28] dropped like Coinbase, Gemini. I'm
[37:31] forgetting there was there was a few
[37:32] other ones
[37:33] but previously I think that the previous
[37:35] administration was going aggressively
[37:38] after I think more the crypto industry
[37:41] than than Bitcoin in particular. But
[37:43] unfortunately Bitcoin always gets uh
[37:45] looped in with the rest of that junk.
[37:48] Um,
[37:50] so since since Trump was elected, I
[37:53] mean, we've seen many of those charges
[37:55] drop. At the same time, unfortunately,
[37:57] we've also seen him, you know, go out
[37:59] there and promote his own meme coin or
[38:01] whatever. Um, so the the good and the
[38:03] bad kind of come together in that case.
[38:06] But I do think it was significant. And
[38:08] it's funny, you know, at the beginning
[38:09] of the conversation, we talked about how
[38:10] the general public is still kind of
[38:12] sleeping on Bitcoin. Um, I I really
[38:15] would have thought, you know, getting
[38:18] Trump elected would uh wake them up, but
[38:22] I think that the Bitcoin lobby, I'll
[38:24] call it that, really did have a
[38:26] significant impact in the election. And
[38:30] you can just see like, you know, it was
[38:33] essentially a single issue for for
[38:35] people who were holding Bitcoin in it. I
[38:37] I really do think that a very small
[38:39] number, the intrigent intransit uh
[38:42] minority, I'm mispronouncing that, uh
[38:45] was able to uh basically kind of swing
[38:48] the
[38:49] election. Uh it's massive that you can
[38:52] already see the impact of of Bitcoin as
[38:54] because it was just an topic that he
[38:56] couldn't ignore anymore. And even uh I
[38:59] remember Harris uh being more and more
[39:02] open to the idea of Bitcoin closer
[39:05] closer to the election uh where things
[39:07] came up like oh like we we are also we
[39:10] also like crypto. That's right. I mean
[39:13] they yeah they clearly put out some very
[39:16] neutral sounding language. Um but at
[39:19] that point I think it was too little too
[39:20] late. Yeah. And
[39:22] uh um the the big thing for me was Trump
[39:27] actually came to the Bitcoin conference.
[39:29] Trump actually came to the what is it
[39:31] the the the New York City pub uh
[39:35] pub it's it's called uh and and and
[39:39] going there and you can think about in
[39:41] whatever you want. Uh uh I don't have a
[39:44] particular opinion because like I I
[39:46] don't I'm I'm not forced to to vote
[39:48] there. Uh so I never did that but uh
[39:52] it's it's really interesting to see how
[39:56] he got that he has to go there because
[39:58] he can be at 500 other places at that
[40:01] night. Uh and and he goes to rally and
[40:04] and it's always like um uh cost versus
[40:08] reward balance that he has to drive
[40:10] because that evening he could have done
[40:13] a rally with like hundreds of thousands
[40:15] of peoples. uh he chose to go a small
[40:17] bar because he knows that will be really
[40:21] significant for the Bitcoin people and
[40:24] that is I think the big news that he and
[40:27] his team said like oh no we have to go
[40:30] there it's important to win the
[40:31] election.
[40:34] It's funny, you know, there's there's a
[40:36] lot of uh examples of this in Bitcoin
[40:38] where it's like a small you just need to
[40:39] motivate a small number of people uh to
[40:41] do something like, you know, we were
[40:42] talking earlier about self-custody, for
[40:44] example. You know, most of the Bitcoin
[40:46] out there is in self-custody. Now, the
[40:48] number of users is probably significant
[40:51] orders of magnitude smaller than uh the
[40:54] users with exchanges. And it's the same
[40:57] thing, you know, Trump going to Pub Key,
[40:59] you know, there were, I don't know, 100
[41:01] people in that bar or something. But the
[41:04] influence that that bar has uh on people
[41:07] with very deep pockets made it
[41:11] absolutely worth it for him. It's super
[41:14] interesting to to see that. Yeah,
[41:16] there's I mean, you know, I'm I'm based
[41:19] in Austin. That's where Unchain's
[41:20] headquarters is.
[41:22] And the general public, you walk down
[41:24] the street, they have no idea that
[41:26] Austin is a hub for Bitcoin stuff
[41:28] internationally. And the amount of
[41:31] Bitcoin here in Austin is mind-blowing.
[41:34] It is. There is a lot of Bitcoin wealth
[41:37] in this city, and most people are
[41:38] totally
[41:39] unaware. Is Austin uh the best like it's
[41:44] probably really hard to say, but is is
[41:46] Austin kind of the best city for for
[41:48] Bitcoin in in America?
[41:51] Absolutely. Unquestionably,
[41:54] unbiased. Yeah. No, no biases here. No,
[41:57] I think I think Austin has a very very
[42:00] strong community. Um, you know, in in
[42:03] the same building as Unchained is uh
[42:05] Pleb Lab, which does uh developer, you
[42:08] know, resources. There's Bitcoin Park
[42:12] Austin, formerly the Bitcoin Commons, uh
[42:15] is based here in Austin. And there's
[42:17] some great companies that with with lots
[42:19] of employees here um from across the
[42:21] Bitcoin
[42:22] industry. Plus, some of the uh earliest
[42:26] Bitcoin adopters are based here in
[42:29] Austin. So, there's there's some just
[42:31] some really amazing people here. Other
[42:33] cities in the US that I think are very
[42:36] strong in Bitcoin. Um Nashville, New
[42:40] York City,
[42:42] Miami, San
[42:44] Francisco. I think I'm certainly missing
[42:47] a few others, but those are kind of when
[42:50] I think about big Bitcoin cities in the
[42:52] US, those are the cities that pop in my
[42:53] mind. Las Vegas soon. Yeah, soon Vegas.
[43:00] Storm Vegas and they'll, you know, after
[43:02] the conference this year, I think
[43:03] they'll just have no other choice.
[43:05] There's going to be so many Bitcoiners
[43:06] there.
[43:08] I'm I'm really looking forward. I I've
[43:10] I've uh my biggest conferences I've been
[43:12] was Bitcoin Prague. always I I will be
[43:14] at Bitcoin Pro the third time now in a
[43:17] row. Uh I had actually tickets the last
[43:20] two years to do the Bitcoin conference
[43:22] in Miami and Nashville. There's always
[43:26] there was always something coming in the
[43:27] way. This year I was like this this is a
[43:29] set like I have to be in the hospital to
[43:31] not go this time. I even if I'm sick I I
[43:34] will fly there and and maybe I get get
[43:36] fit again. I I definitely will will go
[43:39] there because I just want to want to see
[43:41] what's what's going on. I think and and
[43:43] Vegas could be uh massive. Uh when I
[43:46] hear the the organizers talk, it's I
[43:48] think it's it could be really cool
[43:50] event. You will be probably there,
[43:51] right? Absolutely. Uh you know, barring,
[43:54] you know, some some life events, I will
[43:56] also be there. I haven't missed one of
[43:57] the Bitcoin conferences. I've been every
[44:00] year since they started in San Francisco
[44:01] in 2019. Um was it three years in Miami
[44:06] and then Nashville, now Las Vegas.
[44:09] Wouldn't wouldn't miss it. I mean it is
[44:12] it's by far the largest conference that
[44:14] I've ever been to um just in terms of
[44:17] the production and the number of people
[44:20] and I think it dwarfs like all other
[44:23] financial conferences in the US and
[44:26] potentially you know potentially the
[44:28] world I don't know the world um metrics
[44:30] but definitely dwarfs the other
[44:32] conferences in the US and it's funny one
[44:36] of the years uh in Miami I was standing
[44:39] in line you know there was a bit of a
[44:41] line to get in because it was so
[44:42] popular. And there's these reporters
[44:44] there and they're like, "Wow, what do
[44:46] you think about this hour-long line to
[44:48] get into this conference and they were
[44:50] kind of asking me, you know, a leading
[44:54] question to talk about how, you know,
[44:55] disorganized, quote unquote, the
[44:57] conference was and I just spun it around
[44:58] and I was like, can you believe that
[45:00] 20,000 people are here in Miami waiting
[45:03] in line for multiple hours to learn
[45:06] about Bitcoin?"
[45:08] I don't think that the reporter used
[45:10] that quote or uh liked that, but that's
[45:14] what's constantly mind-blowing to me is
[45:16] that so many people from around the
[45:18] entire world are flying to the US for
[45:21] these conferences and we are getting
[45:26] speakers like presidential candidates. I
[45:28] mean, I never dreamed of going, you
[45:30] know, dreamed that I would ever go to a
[45:32] political rally, but because we're in
[45:34] Bitcoin, the politicians are coming to
[45:37] us. Uh, we don't have to go anywhere.
[45:39] They just come and show up because, you
[45:41] know, now the Bitcoin space is so
[45:44] influential. It's it's really uh
[45:47] something I've never thought about in
[45:50] that hard about the power of the Bitcoin
[45:54] space already now. And uh I like
[45:58] actually till till this day as you said
[46:00] it now um it's not a big group of
[46:03] people. Uh and I always said like oh
[46:05] like Trump acknowledged that the the
[46:08] voter group is so big. Uh but the voter
[46:10] group is not that. It's like most people
[46:13] and we talked about it like you know
[46:15] like uh uh most bitcoin are held by
[46:19] individuals but most individuals hold
[46:22] their bitcoin with exchanges because
[46:23] it's like the quantity of users uh are
[46:26] in exchanges but the quality uh or like
[46:30] amount quality uh is held in in in self
[46:35] custody h and this is where the power is
[46:38] and and that's why all those politicians
[46:40] also come to the conferences because
[46:42] they recognize how powerful this very
[46:46] small community. If if you are one year
[46:49] in two years, 3 years very engaged in
[46:52] Bitcoin, you know, most people, you
[46:55] know, how how how things are a little
[46:56] bit connected. Of course, you're only on
[46:58] the surface, but uh it's it's not like a
[47:02] massively big
[47:05] um uh industry where you have to study
[47:08] and then see the all the different
[47:09] networks. you you get an overview of the
[47:12] industry quite quickly if you are an
[47:14] engaged uh viewer and you actually uh
[47:17] talk with people and go to all the
[47:18] conferences and then see okay there's
[47:20] like unchained all the time and there's
[47:22] this company all the time like you you
[47:24] connect certain dots uh uh this is kind
[47:28] of amazing to me to to see that small
[47:30] community have that impact and I think
[47:31] some people will point to that and say
[47:33] this is proof that Bitcoin is really
[47:35] centralized amongst the early adopters
[47:38] and I think that that's partially true
[47:39] like the early adopters certainly have
[47:41] more Bitcoin than newcomers, but it's
[47:44] also just a nature of decentralization
[47:47] in a free
[47:49] market. So, there's a there's very I
[47:52] think there's a very clear Bitcoin
[47:54] adoption kind of funnel, right? You're
[47:56] out there in the world, you've heard
[47:58] about this Bitcoin thing, you're like,
[48:00] "All right, I got to get a little bit."
[48:02] You sign up for an exchange. You buy a
[48:04] little Bitcoin. You maybe forget about
[48:06] it for a few years. The price spikes and
[48:10] then you think, "Oh man, I remember I
[48:11] bought some Bitcoin on exchange." You go
[48:13] log in. You see, wow, this is a lot of
[48:15] money. I don't know if I trust this
[48:16] exchange. Like, what are my next
[48:18] options? Then you learn about hardware
[48:20] wallets. You learn about collaborative
[48:22] custody. You learn about self-custody.
[48:25] Uh, and you you kind of go down that
[48:27] pathway. And as Bitcoin becomes more and
[48:29] more a part of your savings and you know
[48:32] your your financial plan, um those
[48:36] options become more obvious. And you
[48:39] know hopefully for most people you can
[48:42] you can come to that decision and
[48:44] understanding before anything bad
[48:46] happens with your custodian or exchange.
[48:48] Um it's not the case for everyone, but
[48:51] some people learn tough lessons
[48:53] unfortunately. And yeah, this is just
[48:55] the process of Bitcoin decentralizing.
[48:58] So more and more people over time are
[49:00] taking control of keys, you know, within
[49:03] with a an hour or two of learning. I
[49:05] think anybody can do it confidently. And
[49:08] again, I I talked about this earlier
[49:09] comparing it to like learning how to
[49:11] drive a car to to drive a car. I mean,
[49:12] it took in the US, I think it's like a
[49:14] month or two of classes and then an exam
[49:16] and then, you know, you have your permit
[49:18] and so on. So it's it's really difficult
[49:20] to learn how to drive a car and
[49:21] everybody in the US drives a car
[49:24] essentially. Um so I think everybody in
[49:26] the US has the ability to actually
[49:28] secure your keys to Bitcoin. It's just
[49:30] learning a new technology and yes the
[49:32] technology is different and you have to
[49:33] be careful but uh it's not particularly
[49:37] challenging once you understand it. this
[49:39] topic of um because I hear it more more
[49:43] from uh friends that are more on the
[49:46] social side uh and uh are careful to get
[49:49] into Bitcoin of like hey it's so unfair
[49:52] that this OG's Bitcoin have so much
[49:53] wealth I'm get really almost angry at
[49:56] that uh because I've I'm not an OG like
[50:00] I miss Bitcoin many times before I
[50:03] actually bought it and when I bought it
[50:04] like needed some time to also get deep
[50:07] in so I hold Bitcoin since not even 5
[50:10] years. Uh and it needed sometimes to
[50:13] actually buy uh buy within a significant
[50:16] amount of my wealth in there. Uh but
[50:19] I've been around since about the cycle
[50:21] now. Uh and if you uh see let's say 10
[50:26] years, let's say the definition of OG is
[50:28] also interesting. If you see like 10
[50:30] years of an OG, there's so many
[50:32] opportunities to mess it up technically
[50:35] of like losing your keys, being in the
[50:37] wrong exchange, like all those getting
[50:40] hacked, getting stolen, you can mess
[50:44] Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. like the the the
[50:46] one thing is for me just the
[50:48] technicality and then as you said the
[50:50] selling thing I just want to point that
[50:52] to out to people for because I think uh
[50:56] we we don't talk about that enough and
[50:57] I'm really curious what what would you
[50:59] say to that I just pulled up uh for the
[51:01] people that just listen this is the
[51:03] chart of Bitcoin the last 9 years from
[51:06] 2016 uh so if you actually held Bitcoin
[51:09] for like a long period of time let's say
[51:11] 9 years you've gone through let's say a
[51:14] a 200 000 almost 3,000% plus in like a
[51:19] year uh and have not sold and you also
[51:23] have gone through like a 65 70%
[51:28] uh draw down and you have not sold and
[51:31] going through that emotional roller
[51:34] coaster of like oh my wealth is
[51:36] still up and then it's going down that
[51:38] much again. Honestly, if you had nine
[51:41] years uh and your majority of wealth is
[51:44] still in Bitcoin, you deserve that.
[51:46] Like, good for you. Yeah. I think
[51:47] everyone um it's that myth of the
[51:50] overnight success, right, where you
[51:54] know, you look at Amazon and you're
[51:55] like, "Wow, that company overnight
[51:57] success, but it took them 20 years or
[51:59] something to to achieve that." In
[52:01] Bitcoin, I think it's much faster. I
[52:02] think you're right. I think it's uh one
[52:04] to two cycles. So maybe uh maybe 5 to 8
[52:07] years and you're starting to accumulate
[52:10] a significant uh amount of your wealth
[52:12] in it. Um but yeah, it's not definitely
[52:15] not easy. Um I've experienced a few of
[52:18] those 2,000% gains, 80% crashes myself.
[52:22] And you that's why they call them
[52:24] diamond hands. They call them diamond
[52:26] hands for a reason. You're not um you
[52:28] know, you're not holding on for dear
[52:30] life. You're you're calm. you're feeling
[52:34] secure. You know that your Bitcoin is
[52:36] safe. You know the fundamentals of
[52:38] Bitcoin, that there will only ever be 21
[52:40] million and that the world is waking up
[52:44] to this. And when you have that
[52:46] confidence and you understand the
[52:48] fundamentals, still not easy, but it
[52:51] makes it uh better. And and for someone
[52:53] like myself, I've been in Bitcoin for a
[52:55] while now. I actually can't imagine
[52:58] storing a significant percentage of my
[53:00] wealth not in Bitcoin. I mean, what
[53:03] would I buy? Here in Austin, the real
[53:05] estate market is taking a hit. Um,
[53:07] houses are they went up a lot in value,
[53:10] but uh the market is stagnant. People
[53:12] aren't able to sell uh houses at the
[53:15] interest rates currently. You know,
[53:17] there's some stocks that maybe look
[53:19] somewhat interesting, but there's a lot
[53:21] of risk in the stock market. And I think
[53:24] during, you know, one or many of Michael
[53:26] Sailor's presentations, he always talks
[53:28] about how, you know, something like 80%
[53:30] of the stock market is driven by seven
[53:32] companies or something like that. And uh
[53:34] if you don't own the right company, um
[53:37] you're probably just treading water. You
[53:38] know, if you're owning an index fund and
[53:40] you're getting 10% or 14% a year, that's
[53:44] I think essentially treading water of
[53:46] the real inflation rate um of the US
[53:49] dollar. There's an amazing video um that
[53:53] Michael Sailor has done with a guest
[53:56] talking about the different risk factors
[54:01] when you buy a stock when you buy
[54:03] basically a security and he built it in
[54:06] a way where he talked about that's
[54:08] applicable to all companies also to his
[54:11] own companies and I've sat through that
[54:14] hour and was like I can never buy a
[54:16] stock again. Sounds like there are too
[54:18] many risks involved.
[54:20] Yeah. People look at me and think, "Oh
[54:23] man, you're crazy. You have, you know,
[54:25] most of your wealth in Bitcoin. How do
[54:26] you sleep at night?" But it actually
[54:29] feels significantly less risky to me
[54:32] than to your point gambling on a stock.
[54:35] Uh I have no idea, you know, what these
[54:37] companies are doing. There's a lot of uh
[54:39] black swan events with, you know, the
[54:41] central banks. They can pull levers that
[54:44] create winners and they create losers.
[54:47] And uh it just seems more like gambling
[54:49] to me. Whereas Bitcoin feels like
[54:51] savings because I know there will only
[54:53] ever be 21 million. I know how keys
[54:55] work. I know how multi-IG addresses work
[54:58] and I can feel confident and I feel like
[54:59] that's my edge personally.
[55:02] Absolutely. How was
[55:04] um what I because there are sometimes
[55:07] new people and uh I was extremely scared
[55:11] in the first time when like the vol when
[55:13] you see the volatility. How was that for
[55:15] you when you started uh seeing the
[55:17] volatility and going up going down? Did
[55:20] you on on some of the tips sell either
[55:23] on the way down or on the way up? I had
[55:26] I wouldn't say it was a easy first few
[55:30] weeks. I bought uh my first Bitcoin kind
[55:33] of near the end of the 2014 bare market.
[55:36] So, it was after Mount Gaus collapsed in
[55:38] 2013. Um towards the end of 2014 is when
[55:41] I first started learning about Bitcoin.
[55:44] And within a week or two of learning
[55:46] about it and buying some, the price
[55:48] crashed like
[55:49] 60%. So I was like, "Oh, wow. This is
[55:52] really exciting, like new form of
[55:53] money." And I I had enough of the puzzle
[55:55] pieces at that point to understand why I
[55:58] wanted to buy it. Um, and so I bought
[56:00] it. It crashed 60%. I felt like a total
[56:03] idiot, but I thought, you know, I only
[56:06] put a little bit of money in. Maybe, you
[56:07] know, it's half the price now. I'll get
[56:09] twice as many Bitcoin or whatever. So I
[56:12] ended up just putting a little bit more
[56:13] in and a little bit more and a little
[56:14] bit more. Um and then slowly I think you
[56:18] know 2015 2016 the price was very flat.
[56:22] It hardly moved at all but it started
[56:25] kind of going up um a little bit and and
[56:27] it was definitely like a noticeable
[56:28] amount towards the end of 2016 and into
[56:31] 2017 which is when we saw that first run
[56:33] up to
[56:34] 20K. So it felt like um I thought that
[56:38] you know any day hyper bitcoinization
[56:40] was going to happen and it's or the big
[56:44] thing in in 2015 was that the ETFs are
[56:46] going to be approved um because that's
[56:48] when I believe the WL boss twins filed
[56:50] their first uh ETF uh submission was
[56:53] like 2014 2015 so all the news on um our
[56:59] Bitcoin the Reddit subreddit uh was
[57:01] about how the ETF is imminent and uh it
[57:04] took you
[57:05] a decade later for it to finally get
[57:08] approved. Um, but yeah, I think I think
[57:11] everyone's everyone has to experience uh
[57:14] the the dips in order to forge the
[57:17] diamond hands is what I would say. And
[57:20] you just you need to go into Bitcoin
[57:22] understanding that it is extremely
[57:24] volatile and understanding why it's
[57:27] extremely volatile. is extremely
[57:29] volatile because it has a fixed supply
[57:31] of 21 million and there are no circuit
[57:33] breakers, right? With the dollar, with
[57:37] uh the euro, with stocks, um they can
[57:40] shut down trading. Um with the dollar,
[57:42] if the price gets a little too volatile,
[57:44] they'll print more money or take money
[57:46] out of the system. With Bitcoin, there's
[57:49] no adjusting anything about it. And so
[57:53] all of the volatility is based
[57:55] exclusively on the current demand for
[57:58] Bitcoin. And once you understand the
[58:00] basic kind of economics and the basic
[58:02] technology side of it, I think it makes
[58:04] holding it through the volatility much
[58:06] easier. And now when it's volatile, I
[58:08] get excited because then I get to save.
[58:10] How was it living through uh the ETF
[58:15] launch when you were already excited
[58:17] about it 10 years ago? I I think I
[58:20] tweeted like a a month or two before
[58:23] they launched and I was like I was like
[58:25] everyone's really excited about the ETFs
[58:26] but just be ready for them to be delayed
[58:28] for a
[58:30] decade. So I was I was very cautiously
[58:34] optimistic um about them but uh I I was
[58:39] prepared to wait uh because again this
[58:42] is it was the same emotions that I had
[58:44] you know at the beginning of last year
[58:45] as I had in 2015 2016. I was going into
[58:48] my friends offices and saying the ETF is
[58:51] going to be approved. We're going to,
[58:52] you know, it's going to go to I think at
[58:53] that point 10K was a lot. It's going to
[58:55] go to 10K. Um and uh my my friends would
[58:58] roll their eyes at me. But look who's
[59:01] laughing now. And it did uh go to 10K
[59:05] just two years ago. Uh two two years
[59:06] later, right? 2015 2017 it hit the 10K
[59:09] without the ETF. That's right. Yeah, it
[59:12] went I mean it went to 75K before the
[59:15] ETFs were launched. Um I believe that
[59:18] was crazy.
[59:21] It's it's really it also went uh before
[59:24] we have a strategic Bitcoin reserve in
[59:26] America to over 100k. Uh that was also
[59:28] something uh significant. Uh
[59:32] imagine imagine America actually
[59:34] starting to buy um because
[59:37] now from what I understand they now just
[59:41] uh took the Bitcoin they already have
[59:43] and put a different name on there. So,
[59:46] so yeah, it's a strategic bit reserve
[59:49] and I get the meaning behind the
[59:51] different words and and what what that
[59:53] does. But until they really start to
[59:56] say, hey, we are America and we are
[59:59] accumulating X amount of Bitcoin each
[60:02] year, I think till this point comes,
[60:06] um it's hard that it it won't be as
[60:11] bullish as now. Now, now they just say
[60:13] like, "Oh, like we have that Bitcoin.
[60:15] It's a strategic bit reserve." Now, I
[60:17] think with a lot of politics and just
[60:20] policy in general, it's all about kind
[60:22] of pushing the needle far enough where
[60:24] the needle can't go back. And I think
[60:26] that that's what happened with the
[60:27] strategic Bitcoin reserve is now that it
[60:29] has been established, there's no going
[60:31] back. And it is only a matter of time
[60:34] until to your point the the the
[60:38] administration whatever administration
[60:39] that is says okay we need to start
[60:41] aggressively accumulating we have the
[60:43] framework in place let's go for it and I
[60:46] do think you know there are some bills
[60:48] uh currently proposed where uh the US
[60:52] will begin to accumulate if they pass
[60:54] but it's just a matter of time like even
[60:56] if this round of bills doesn't pass uh
[60:59] some will in the future it's the same
[61:01] thing
[61:01] for statewide strategic Bitcoin
[61:04] reserves. Um, so there's there's a bunch
[61:06] of different US states that have
[61:08] proposals for strategic Bitcoin
[61:10] reserves. Um, they will eventually say
[61:12] yes. I think one one interesting example
[61:14] of not a strategic Bitcoin reserve, but
[61:16] a sovereign uh or a pension fund is the
[61:19] Wisconsin pension fund uh established or
[61:22] started buying Bitcoin ETFs I think when
[61:24] they first launched and they started
[61:26] with 1%.
[61:28] um now that the value of the Bitcoin is
[61:30] increased, they've actually uh increased
[61:31] the percentage of Bitcoin that they're
[61:33] willing to hold. And it's it's always
[61:35] funny how that
[61:36] happens. You're like, I'll start with
[61:38] this percent and then once you achieve
[61:40] that percent, again, weighing the
[61:43] alternatives, it's like, well, if I'm
[61:44] going to sell it, what am I going to
[61:45] sell it for? Uh is it going to
[61:47] outperform Bitcoin? Bitcoin becomes your
[61:49] own personal hurdle, right?
[61:51] it this are always because like family
[61:55] members and and and and older colleagues
[61:58] like the 40 50 years old I'm now 26 just
[62:02] um uh when I talk with them like oh this
[62:05] this in in Bitcoin and then I'm only in
[62:08] Bitcoin and they're like oh like what's
[62:10] your exit strategy what what will you
[62:12] sell it for? Uh and I'm like yeah
[62:15] exactly like what what would I sell it
[62:17] for? What else can I buy right now?
[62:19] Should I buy Eurob bonds? Uh like what
[62:23] the heck should I do?
[62:25] Well, I hear there's some beautiful
[62:27] castles and stuff in Austria. So, one of
[62:30] them has your name on it. Yeah. Uh
[62:32] Schlushon would be nice. That that uh
[62:35] that that that would be great. Rob
[62:37] Robin's Palace, but that's a long way to
[62:40] go.
[62:42] Uh well, I just want to show this to
[62:44] people if they're interested in in in
[62:47] Oh, I almost Yeah. uh if they're
[62:49] interested in in strategic Bitcoin
[62:51] reserves and the state laws because I
[62:54] was really surprised when I saw this the
[62:56] first time. Um Julian Farah who made
[63:00] that website uh uh gave that to me and I
[63:02] was super surprised how many bills there
[63:05] are. Uh and it actually goes I I
[63:08] remember this this uh metric was under
[63:12] 80. This metric was under 40 and this
[63:14] was also lower. Uh so it's actually it's
[63:17] growing quite a bit. Uh and uh and this
[63:21] is where you can actually nicely uh see
[63:23] all the bears and where they are. Uh was
[63:26] super interesting for me. And you can
[63:28] also go to the to the uh
[63:31] uh to the or primary source. uh and he
[63:35] kind of opened my eyes that it's not
[63:37] just about the Federal Reserve uh or
[63:41] like the the government buying Bitcoin
[63:43] or like accumulating Bitcoin, but the
[63:46] United States of America are many states
[63:50] that can all individually also buy
[63:52] Bitcoin. uh and that might just be the
[63:56] even more bullish case because if they
[63:59] do it, it's just also a matter of time
[64:01] the countries in Europe, the countries
[64:04] in uh uh in in in other states and
[64:08] nations will also do it. I was listening
[64:10] to uh Pierre Rashard on a podcast
[64:14] recently. I think he went on like four
[64:15] different podcasts, so I can't remember
[64:16] which one, but one thing he said that
[64:18] was uh kind of stuck with me is that
[64:21] this policy and this way of legislating
[64:23] Bitcoin adoption is a way of uh
[64:26] essentially helping people who, you
[64:30] know, don't even like Bitcoin or
[64:31] potentially even hate Bitcoin uh to
[64:33] weather any sort of storm um any sort of
[64:36] like monetary problems that could come
[64:38] up with the US dollar because if all of
[64:40] their wealth is kind of, you know, maybe
[64:43] a few layers deep backed by Bitcoin,
[64:45] they're just going to be better off and
[64:47] uh they'll be able to um they'll just be
[64:49] able to continue living even if there is
[64:52] some sort of major financial crisis um
[64:54] just simply because Bitcoin has been
[64:56] embedded into the different systems that
[64:58] they interact with the state level, the
[65:00] federal level, Wall Street, um the
[65:03] financial system. Bitcoin's just making
[65:06] its way into everything, attacking on
[65:08] all fronts.
[65:10] Absolutely. Really interesting. Um, one
[65:13] last question I have for for you, uh,
[65:16] especially as a Bitcoiner that is long
[65:17] in Bitcoin, um, you probably have gone
[65:20] through the journey of, okay, I have
[65:22] Bitcoin, I'm sovereign with my money.
[65:25] Um, how can you be sovereign uh, outside
[65:29] of money? Uh, have you looked into that
[65:31] and like, okay, how can I be even more
[65:34] sovereign and free outside of just
[65:37] having the best sovereign money? There
[65:39] are a few different ways that kind of
[65:41] come to mind when I think about
[65:43] that. I think of so I think in the US at
[65:45] least like owning property is not
[65:47] necessarily a way to be sovereign at
[65:48] least in Texas because you're you're
[65:50] paying property tax for every year,
[65:53] right? You can't stop paying property
[65:55] tax and so you're never in my mind you
[65:57] don't never truly own uh whatever you
[66:00] know property you
[66:01] might you might have the the title to.
[66:05] Um but when I think about becoming truly
[66:07] sovereign, I think about maybe
[66:09] multi-jurisdictional
[66:11] um uh either ownership like a second
[66:15] passport or owning land in different
[66:17] countries just so that um if something
[66:19] happens in one country um you know you
[66:22] you have other alternatives but I think
[66:25] you know personally my strategy is just
[66:26] to help upgrade the US so that I don't
[66:30] have to become a refugee. Um, so I want
[66:34] to just embed Bitcoin into as many
[66:36] different systems as possible here in
[66:38] the US so that um the country is just
[66:40] continues to be prosperous and I don't
[66:42] have to worry about um about that. I
[66:45] think a lot of a lot of folks tend to
[66:49] kind of overindex on the like tinfoil
[66:52] hat and becoming like super sovereign
[66:56] mountain man. And I personally am just a
[66:59] unabashed capitalist. Um, I want to be
[67:01] able to specialize in what I specialize
[67:03] in. And then I want to be able to work
[67:05] with people who are specialists in, you
[67:08] know, defense, in farming, in um, you
[67:11] know, real estate, you know, every
[67:13] single industry, right? I think that's
[67:15] how prosperous societies function is by
[67:19] individuals specializing and then being
[67:21] able to um, help others. Um, and so
[67:24] that's, you know, maybe not a hope isn't
[67:27] a plan. That's what they say, but I
[67:29] really think that my best effort can be
[67:32] um put towards just upgrading the US and
[67:35] then making sure that our my country is
[67:37] really really strong and secure.
[67:40] That's awesome. I love that you bring up
[67:42] uh flag theory basically uh and plan B.
[67:46] I made uh because I noticed that so many
[67:49] people are interested in that and I just
[67:50] made uh one video with with with Katie
[67:54] and there are many other experts that
[67:56] that that do that also the Bitcoin way
[67:58] and then like many other uh services uh
[68:00] out there but I just made with her the
[68:02] video uh around flag theory and and and
[68:05] what are options and what you can do and
[68:08] why it's also important. Uh another
[68:10] great Bitcoiner by the way Katie. Oh
[68:13] actually I didn't know that.
[68:16] That that's awesome. Uh but yeah, it's
[68:18] so uh it's so important uh that topic.
[68:22] Also, unfortunately, Austria doesn't
[68:23] allow two passports, but I'm also uh I
[68:26] have an Indian girlfriend. That's my
[68:28] second passport.
[68:29] There you go. Well, I mean, I think
[68:31] Austria is also in a great position to
[68:34] um adopt Bitcoin and just embed it into
[68:36] all the systems and um you know,
[68:39] maintain its prosperity there.
[68:41] it would be the home of Austrian
[68:43] economics, but uh unfortunately it's I I
[68:47] said it the the previous episode was
[68:50] with Stephen uh Stefan Lera uh and uh I
[68:54] said it to him also and for when I came
[68:57] into Bitcoin I I heard everyone talking
[68:59] about Austrian economics and being
[69:02] someone in Austria I was like the
[69:03] economics in Austria is not that special
[69:05] like why is everyone talking about that
[69:07] and then I slowly got to know like oh
[69:09] they're talking about something I never
[69:11] heard about Hayek or Mises or anything
[69:13] about that before Bitcoin like Bitcoin
[69:16] teached me that even though I was in
[69:19] Austria and and was going to the
[69:21] educational uh journey till like 21
[69:24] years old through like uh school and
[69:26] then starting university also never
[69:28] heard it before Bitcoin.
[69:30] Same same with me actually. I got a
[69:32] degree in economics and I didn't learn
[69:35] economics until Bitcoin. I didn't learn
[69:36] about Hayek, Mises, Rothbard. None of
[69:39] those names were mentioned in my
[69:41] economics program at a university in the
[69:43] US. Super super sad. Um bizarre.
[69:48] Um I have one question that I asked each
[69:50] and every one of my guests and I'm
[69:52] actually not sure if I asked you this
[69:53] last time because I've uh introduced it
[69:55] somewhere last year. Uh but I I will
[69:59] just throw the question to you. Maybe
[70:00] you get it now second time. Uh what can
[70:03] we learn from you besides Bitcoin? My
[70:05] other major passion right now is
[70:07] mountain biking. So, I've actually been
[70:09] mountain biking since
[70:12] 2011 and uh got into racing, just
[70:15] amateur racing. Yeah, spent a lot of my
[70:17] free time out on the single tracks. Uh I
[70:20] actually just wrote an article,
[70:21] hopefully will be published this week
[70:23] called 10 mountain biking tips that will
[70:25] help you understand Bitcoin. Um so,
[70:28] check it out hopefully on Bitcoin
[70:29] Magazine. Um, the mountain bike world
[70:32] cup season is kicking off this weekend.
[70:34] So, I figured it would be a good time to
[70:36] try to marry the two passions, uh,
[70:38] Bitcoin and mountain biking. I was
[70:40] inspired by some colleagues at Unchained
[70:42] who published last year, uh, a piece
[70:45] about Bitcoin and golf, which ended up
[70:47] resulting in the Max and Stacy Max and
[70:49] Stacy Invitational in El Salvador. So, a
[70:52] cool golf tournament was put on. So, you
[70:53] never know what happens um when you kind
[70:56] of introduce your your passion uh to
[70:59] Bitcoin and and you know, put that out
[71:02] there. So, that's that's what what I'm
[71:04] hoping to do is uh see if there's any uh
[71:06] mountain bikers out there that want to
[71:08] learn about Bitcoin um or go for a ride
[71:10] with me in in Austin. And uh I'm pretty
[71:13] happy with the article. I got it
[71:14] reviewed by two uh pretty prominent
[71:17] mountain bikers. Um so, you'll have to
[71:18] check it out to figure out who it is.
[71:20] Really, really cool. And at the time of
[71:23] this, when it it's released, it will
[71:24] already be out. So, uh um I usually do
[71:29] that later, but uh you probably uh uh
[71:31] post it somewhere also on your Twitter,
[71:33] right? You have a Twitter where people
[71:35] can go. That's right. You can follow me,
[71:39] philore on Twitter. My email uh address
[71:42] is
[71:43] philunchain.com. Feel free to, you know,
[71:46] follow me on Twitter. I'm I think
[71:47] Twitter DM is really the best way to get
[71:49] in contact with me. Uh, and yeah, would
[71:51] would love to talk about Bitcoin,
[71:53] mountain biking, anything else. It's
[71:56] Twitter TM is also my ma main platform.
[71:59] I thought about it last time. What What
[72:01] do I do if Twitter bans me like all my
[72:06] contacts are there? I mean, probably I
[72:07] can reach out to most of them also uh
[72:10] with other channels, but like I'm pretty
[72:12] reliant currently on the Twitter DMs.
[72:15] Yeah, me too. I'm unfortunately also
[72:17] trying to build out LinkedIn, but
[72:19] LinkedIn is
[72:21] um not my favorite. Yeah, it's it's it's
[72:24] normal and but I actually think it's
[72:26] important for Bitcoiners to go out
[72:29] there. I I I
[72:31] I get hate when I say that, but I'm I'm
[72:35] not a fan of we all move to Nostra. Um,
[72:38] I think we Bitcoiners are digital
[72:41] soldiers in in an information war and we
[72:45] have to get where we
[72:48] can get the Bitcoin signal out the best.
[72:50] Twitter actually has a very solid group
[72:53] of Bitcoiners already. Uh, so Twitter is
[72:56] for me just a space to connect with
[72:58] other Bitcoiners. YouTube is actually
[73:00] space where uh you can actually get to
[73:03] new coiners and then and and like
[73:05] pre-coiners uh and like places like
[73:08] LinkedIn, Instagram and Tik Tok those
[73:11] are the uh battlegrounds where there are
[73:14] not a lot of Bitcoiners. Uh so uh I
[73:17] encourage everyone that is new to
[73:18] Bitcoin and wants to start content
[73:19] creating like go to those platforms
[73:21] first. Like that's where Bitcoiners are
[73:23] needed more than on Twitter and YouTube.
[73:26] coming from a guy that only makes
[73:28] content for Twitter and YouTube sounds a
[73:29] little weird, but
[73:32] I agree with you. I think uh kind of
[73:34] what I said before is just we need to be
[73:35] attacking on all fronts and and uh
[73:39] getting in front of the different
[73:40] audiences. Um so, you know, there's some
[73:44] statistics out there. You can actually
[73:45] like go and look up the you know,
[73:47] demographics of different social media
[73:48] platforms and I recommend just picking
[73:51] the one that is most unlike you and then
[73:54] go and post there and see what happens.
[73:56] Now, maybe you want to use a a NIM or or
[73:59] protect your identity or something like
[74:00] that, but it's really important to get
[74:03] these ideas out to everyone and even
[74:05] even to people who aren't necessarily
[74:07] going to be the most receptive to them.
[74:09] Absolutely. And as you know, we have
[74:11] Android in the podcast where the
[74:12] previous guest is asking a question for
[74:14] the next guest without knowing who the
[74:16] next guest actually is. Uh, and your
[74:18] last guest ask you an impossible
[74:21] question uh to answer because there's
[74:23] just so much you can choose from. Uh,
[74:26] what is your favorite Bitcoin meme? It
[74:28] has to be Carlos Matoss from Bitconnect.
[74:31] He's Do you know that one? No, actually
[74:34] not. Oh, it's a very good one. So, uh,
[74:37] it's from 2017, I think. Bitconnect was
[74:40] a shitcoin um that was just a complete
[74:43] Ponzi scheme. actually probably more um
[74:46] more professional than the meme coins or
[74:49] whatever is popular right now, but uh he
[74:52] went on stage and uh was just acting
[74:54] like a crazy man. Um so look up Carlos
[74:58] Matoss, M A T O S Bitconnect, and
[75:02] there's some great videos. There's, you
[75:03] know, him screaming and aim with lasers
[75:06] and stuff. It's awesome. Oh yeah. Is
[75:08] that Is that that guy? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
[75:10] Oh man. interesting watch because it's
[75:14] it's just outstanding. Oh. Uh wait, if
[75:18] you have time, we can still quickly do
[75:20] that. I I would love to watch it, but I
[75:22] have to unfortunately change to uh the
[75:26] the the other screen here. Uh so people
[75:30] can also hear it. Uh let me just quickly
[75:34] set that up. Uh because I'm now I I I
[75:38] want to I want to see that now quickly.
[75:41] Okay. Okay. And I have I have a question
[75:43] for the next guest.
[75:45] What's what's the next country that's
[75:48] going to establish a strategic Bitcoin
[75:49] reserve? Ah,
[75:52] nice. That What would you guess which
[75:55] one it is? I would guess that's really
[75:57] tough. Maybe I don't even know. I I want
[76:00] to say like a country potentially
[76:03] in like Africa, but it also might just
[76:06] be Russia. Oh, sorry. Is that that?
[76:08] Yeah, that
[76:23] is. There's more to the video, too. But
[76:26] it is just outrageous. It's very good.
[76:29] There's a 4minute video of that. I Yeah.
[76:32] Well, the intro is good because he
[76:33] really starts to hype up the audience,
[76:35] you know. Um, and then he Yeah, here it
[76:39] is.
[77:08] Gosh, that's super interesting.
[77:11] Uh, yeah. Um, so yeah, people have
[77:14] something to watch afterwards.
[77:18] I want to deliver real value to your
[77:20] guests here today, Robin.
[77:23] I love that. Uh, really cool. Thank you
[77:25] so much. uh Phil um we already have
[77:28] where where people can find you and uh
[77:30] the next uh question for the next guest.
[77:33] So, thank you so much for for taking
[77:35] your time, Phil. Also, thank you so much
[77:36] for everyone that is watching and
[77:38] listening for joining us today. As
[77:40] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[77:41] another episode. Bye-bye.
[77:48] [Music]
