[00:00] Bitcoin immediately goes from let's say
[00:02] 85 90,000 or 110,000 per coin it
[00:05] immediately goes to 300,000 350,000
[00:07] overnight there's no Market there's no
[00:09] bid it's the cosmic moment if you
[00:12] weren't paying attention you will find
[00:14] yourself on the wrong side of History we
[00:16] are now entering into the Bitcoin era
[00:18] and El salbador is really the first to
[00:20] enter the Bitcoin era Bitcoin is a
[00:22] peaceful Revolution and so it's similar
[00:25] to the Christian revolution in a sense
[00:28] you know the message of Christ was that
[00:30] love can create change and progress
[00:34] every Fiat money gold property old
[00:36] Master's art cars stamps coins Bitcoin
[00:40] is guaranteed to increase purchasing
[00:41] power everything goes to zero against
[00:43] Bitcoin Central Bank digital currencies
[00:44] are just an extension of the Fiat money
[00:46] World same thing with altcoins all
[00:48] altcoins whether it's ethereum or any of
[00:50] the other 20 30 or 40,000 altcoins they
[00:53] are an extension of Fiat money they're
[00:54] not part of the Bitcoin Universe I think
[00:56] one of the interesting design attributes
[00:58] of Bitcoin is that it's designed to be
[01:00] attacked and the more you attack it the
[01:02] greater the hash rate goes up and
[01:03] therefore the greater the security and
[01:05] therefore the greater it's use as a
[01:07] store of value we're leading the world
[01:09] in the Bitcoin Revolution we've got the
[01:11] biggest stash of Bitcoin on the reserves
[01:13] of any country we've got Bitcoin legal
[01:15] tender we are Bitcoin country we are
[01:16] attracting the best and the brightest
[01:18] we're attracting the biggest Bitcoin
[01:20] companies from around the
[01:24] world hi Mi how you doing everything
[01:26] fine oh it's great here we are in
[01:29] Paradise El Salvador and enjoying the
[01:32] end of the rainy season the dry season's
[01:35] about to commence and so things are
[01:38] happening really really cool that's
[01:40] actually also my first question about El
[01:42] Salvador because I thought like the
[01:43] first question is really important I
[01:45] mean in 2011 I guess it would have asked
[01:47] you like why Bitcoin and now we're here
[01:50] in 2094 and I ask you like why El
[01:53] Salvador like why is El Salvador such a
[01:55] important topic for you yeah well you
[01:58] know Bitcoin has changed the world and
[02:00] as we said and as we started to say in
[02:03] 2011 that Bitcoin is going to totally
[02:08] transform the global economy and Global
[02:12] society and the N the notion of the
[02:15] nation state will go the same way as the
[02:19] central bank and that is to say become
[02:22] extinct so Central Banking which is
[02:24] approximately 300 year old experiment as
[02:27] well as the nation state which is you
[02:29] could sayx o imately the same a number
[02:31] of years as an experiment in governance
[02:34] these two are co-terminus they will both
[02:37] collapse the same time as societal
[02:40] models and we we are now entering into
[02:42] the Bitcoin era and Al salador is really
[02:46] the first to enter the Bitcoin era so El
[02:49] Salvador is coming out of a 40 50 year
[02:52] uh kind of um Social Nightmare really
[02:56] they had a civil war and then the gang
[02:57] war and then president belli made big
[02:59] coin legal tender and president belli is
[03:01] very much orange pilled and sees the
[03:04] future of governance uh State governance
[03:06] as a decentralized model to kind of
[03:09] mimic what we see in Bitcoin so this is
[03:12] the future I'm living in the future when
[03:14] I'm living in El Salvador and El
[03:16] Salvador now is like buying Bitcoin back
[03:19] in 2011 at a dollar or $10 or $100 you
[03:22] get El salador at the price you deserve
[03:25] I love I love that a lot um how much of
[03:29] the I think uh looking at El Salvador
[03:32] from afar and I'm really happy that in
[03:34] November I finally visit El Salvador for
[03:36] adopting Bitcoin uh but it seems like it
[03:39] does really really good uh if you don't
[03:41] listen to the mainstream media uh I
[03:44] think it doing is doing really really
[03:45] good how much of that is is Bitcoin and
[03:49] the influence of like sound money and
[03:50] they're adopting it and they're trying
[03:52] to be more independent and how much is
[03:53] like na PUK as a as a leader well since
[03:57] uh my job is really to advise on bitcoin
[04:01] and
[04:02] to kind of bring Bitcoin into El
[04:07] Salvador and Bitcoin maximalism I would
[04:09] say it's 100% due to bitcoin you know
[04:12] other people would have another opinion
[04:13] but I think that you know it's no
[04:16] coincidence that after making Bitcoin
[04:18] legal tender then the president became
[04:21] intolerant of the violence that was all
[04:24] around and went to war against the gangs
[04:27] and the country has had a gang ectomy
[04:29] you know the gangs were removed from the
[04:32] country and because Bitcoin is
[04:34] intolerant of violence Bitcoin
[04:37] demonetizes violence and it monetizes
[04:40] peace and love right so it's part of the
[04:41] ethos of Bitcoin and when you talk about
[04:44] adoption of Bitcoin people tend to focus
[04:46] on the payments rail the payments of
[04:48] Bitcoin and is it used on a day-to-day
[04:52] basis for payments but that's only one
[04:55] piece of the adoption Story the most
[04:57] important thing about Bitcoin adoption
[04:59] is that start thinking about Bitcoin you
[05:01] can never even touch Bitcoin and still
[05:02] be orange pilled if you start to think
[05:04] about Bitcoin and what it means to
[05:06] society and to money and it's about a
[05:09] transformative intellectual process
[05:11] where you leave the Fiat money Dark Ages
[05:14] and you enter the the bright orange
[05:16] future of Bitcoin and that's everywhere
[05:19] here in the country the entire country
[05:20] has a 100% adoption rate in my opinion
[05:23] because it's 100% talked about in this
[05:26] country and it's having a profound
[05:29] impact on the day-to-day life of
[05:31] everybody in the
[05:33] country I love the that answer because
[05:35] like I think a lot of people are either
[05:37] focus on the price or on the payments I
[05:39] want to get to the price a little bit
[05:40] later but um the personal Journey that I
[05:43] see and I interviewed now I think you my
[05:46] 204 guest on on the show so I
[05:49] interviewed a lot of bitcoiners and a
[05:50] lot of them have like this Bitcoin
[05:52] moment where their personal Journey uh
[05:54] begins to accelerate and it's it's
[05:56] really fascinating for me what do you if
[05:59] if we go out a little bit in in in the
[06:01] future what do you imagine a world
[06:04] looking like on a Bitcoin standard where
[06:06] we have no feat left we have uh this
[06:08] Bitcoin standard and the whole world is
[06:10] kind of evolved around
[06:12] that I call it the Bitcoin Singularity
[06:15] so Bitcoin essentially algebraically
[06:19] solves for fear algebraically solves for
[06:23] fear you know it um removes fear from
[06:27] human consciousness and because and it
[06:30] replaces it with faith so we have 100%
[06:33] faith-based
[06:35] species if we can get there you know
[06:37] it's kind of a race uh to see whether
[06:39] humans Will Survive the
[06:42] current situation that we have where the
[06:45] worst elements of society are really
[06:48] vying for for dictatorial power in
[06:52] countries around the world and their
[06:54] policy is for total authoritarian
[06:57] control so if we can get through if this
[07:00] next few years then on the other side of
[07:02] it is the Bitcoin Singularity and kind
[07:04] of a global Awakening consciousness of
[07:07] Bitcoin consciousness of love you know
[07:10] love works love is a perfectly
[07:12] acceptable organizing principle if if
[07:15] you have Bitcoin perfect money running
[07:17] in the background and this is as I said
[07:20] demonetizes violence now to give you an
[07:22] example of this for example so humans
[07:25] for half a million years or a million
[07:27] years part of the experience for All
[07:29] Humans was violence from those who might
[07:34] be interested in taking your property
[07:36] for example they if they can't get it by
[07:39] any other means they would resort to
[07:41] violence if you have unconfiscatable
[07:44] property which is Bitcoin then really it
[07:47] it removes violence as an option in
[07:52] accumulating property you have to come
[07:55] into the conversation or into the
[07:59] exchange change with something other
[08:01] than violence because violence just
[08:03] doesn't work in a in a in a post Bitcoin
[08:06] global standard world and so that's what
[08:09] we have on the other side of this I
[08:11] think that humans have been are primed
[08:15] for this type of uh existence it's taken
[08:19] us a long time to get here but I think
[08:21] we're on the verge now of that Bitcoin
[08:23] Singularity and a existence based
[08:27] entirely on love
[08:30] it's interesting that you talk about the
[08:31] the we we get through the next few years
[08:34] uh I feel also like the next few years
[08:36] could be very uh interesting to see with
[08:39] cbdc is on the rise it's it's it's more
[08:41] in the EU uh Less in America but also I
[08:43] think in America it's it's how do you
[08:46] see that with cbdcs and and in
[08:48] interjecting maybe
[08:50] Bitcoin well cbdcs or Central Bank
[08:53] digital currencies are just an extension
[08:54] of the Fiat money world right there's
[08:57] nothing new there it's just more or Fiat
[08:59] money and the same thing with altcoins
[09:02] all
[09:03] altcoins whether it's ethereum or any of
[09:05] the other 20 30 or 40,000 altcoins they
[09:07] are an extension of Fiat money they're
[09:09] not part of the Bitcoin
[09:11] universe and um so as such they're not
[09:19] offering anything new in terms of
[09:22] competing with Bitcoin so I don't see
[09:24] them succeeding in any way
[09:27] cbdcs are just an extension of the
[09:31] problems that we have already it's just
[09:33] more centralization so centralization of
[09:36] the Fiat money world in the central
[09:38] banks causes all the problems and cbdcs
[09:40] are an attempt to make it even more
[09:42] centralized so they're going in the
[09:44] wrong direction they're doubling down on
[09:47] centralization which of course means
[09:49] that they are Expediting their own
[09:51] failure I think one of the interesting
[09:53] design attributes of Bitcoin is that
[09:55] it's designed to be attacked and the
[09:57] more you attack it the greater the cash
[09:59] rate goes up and therefore the greater
[10:01] the security and therefore the greater
[10:03] it's use as a store of value so it's a
[10:06] very interesting situation where Bitcoin
[10:10] really is designed to get attacked in
[10:12] this sense you know if if nobody hated
[10:15] Bitcoin it wouldn't be as successful as
[10:17] it is today we need people to hate
[10:18] Bitcoin and try to attack Bitcoin to
[10:21] make it obvious that it's it's in
[10:25] immutable in indestructible and on its
[10:28] permanent vector it's um it's just we're
[10:31] at that phase where you have the darkest
[10:34] moment before the dawn right before it's
[10:38] the darkest before the dawn you have
[10:39] that Blackness the black period before
[10:43] the Big Bang you know this is really
[10:45] Echoes the big bang I think it's the the
[10:47] Bitcoin Big Bang this the Big Bang of
[10:50] Consciousness that's coming and that's
[10:54] where I see cbdcs I don't see them
[10:57] having any material impact whatsoever
[11:00] it's just the last gasp of a Dying Fiat
[11:04] money
[11:06] mentality I love it a lot did you
[11:09] actually also coin the phrase Bitcoin
[11:11] Maxi does this come from you I was
[11:13] always wondering the Bitcoin Maxi does
[11:16] that come from me you know uh when I was
[11:19] sitting down
[11:20] with um vitalic buin in London back in
[11:24] 2012 when he was still running Bitcoin
[11:27] magazine and before he launched ethereum
[11:30] he had he was pitching ethereum and he
[11:33] told me about it and I was like well
[11:35] this looks like kind of like centralized
[11:37] garbage to me and he's like well you're
[11:40] just a maxi Max so that could have been
[11:43] the birth of that phrase Bitcoin Maxi I
[11:46] mean I think
[11:48] metalic created that phrase but I think
[11:50] it came out of that conversation with me
[11:53] but that could be you know
[11:54] hypocrystalline
[11:59] years now it's interesting really cool
[12:01] but I think Bitcoin maximalism is is
[12:03] actually important for for for for
[12:04] Bitcoin that we have those evangelists
[12:07] um why do you think that is it so
[12:09] important to to stand up against the
[12:11] altcoins against the shitcoins and uh
[12:13] make a very clear distinction because if
[12:15] I go out in the normal world and go out
[12:18] with talk with my uncles they don't get
[12:20] the the difference between Bitcoin and
[12:21] ethereum yeah it's um it's you know we
[12:25] do that's a lot of the work that we do
[12:26] here in El Salvador it's both Bitcoin
[12:29] Centric and talking about Bitcoin and
[12:31] promoting Bitcoin it's also creating a
[12:32] very firm perimeter through which the
[12:35] altcoins and the shitcoins can't get
[12:37] through and we've been really successful
[12:39] in that because look at the last couple
[12:41] years when you had the FTX S bankman
[12:44] free Celsius Luna all those really bad
[12:48] coins that created unbelievable damage
[12:50] none of them appeared here none of them
[12:53] were here because we were very impactful
[12:58] in keeping them out through a number of
[13:01] different ways both legislatively and
[13:04] through just uh through hard grinding on
[13:07] a day-to-day basis by just like going
[13:09] out there and finding them and shutting
[13:11] them down and you see the result here in
[13:13] El Salvador it's it's uh that that's
[13:18] that's the importance of it you see the
[13:19] results we have we don't have the the
[13:22] problem of a shitcoin
[13:25] infestation right so they're really you
[13:27] know they're parasites and so you need
[13:30] to keep them out or they will just
[13:34] nibble away at all everything you you've
[13:36] been working for there's absolutely
[13:38] nothing that any of these shitcoin
[13:41] projects have to offer and here in El
[13:45] Salvador basically the way it's set up
[13:48] is Bitcoin is money and everything else
[13:50] you know you have to go and get
[13:52] registered as a security so unlike the
[13:55] United States where the the SEC will
[13:58] take the approach of a caseby casee
[14:00] study it's enforcement through
[14:03] prosecution or something like this
[14:05] whereas here we have a very clear legal
[14:08] distinction there's Bitcoin and then
[14:10] everything else is an unregistered
[14:12] security uh without any uh
[14:15] equivocation and the results are in you
[14:17] know we're leading the world in in in
[14:20] the Bitcoin Revolution we've got the
[14:22] biggest stash of Bitcoin on the reserves
[14:24] of any country we've got Bitcoin legal
[14:26] tender we are a Bitcoin country we are
[14:28] attracting the best and the brightest
[14:30] we're attracting biggest Bitcoin
[14:32] companies from around the world right so
[14:34] it's we're leading the way here when I
[14:36] when you hear about Donald Trump and
[14:38] he's talking about Bitcoin and he's at
[14:40] the um Nashville event and he's talking
[14:42] about Bitcoin you know on his Bitcoin
[14:44] Journey he's what I call the five stages
[14:47] of Enlightenment of Bitcoin he's I would
[14:49] say on the Second Step uh he hasn't
[14:52] really you know so he's just getting
[14:54] started I also feel like that the RFK is
[14:57] already a little bit little bit close a
[14:59] little bit further ahead and he's
[15:01] already two two years there and and and
[15:03] Trump I think he just discovered it a
[15:05] few few weeks back for the election you
[15:08] got to need to know about Bitcoin as Sor
[15:10] would say um what's the kind of the the
[15:12] future for Salvador I mean the country
[15:14] is small but small countries can can do
[15:16] a lot uh in infect the world with with
[15:19] with the Bitcoin virus the positive
[15:21] Bitcoin virus right well according to
[15:23] Kathy Wood who uh was here recently and
[15:26] came here and did the work and did the
[15:29] due diligence um she her her expectation
[15:33] is for the GDP of El Salvador to 10x to
[15:37] uh 300 billion from the current 32 33
[15:41] billion based on bitcoin and
[15:44] AI so there's a big AI initiative in El
[15:48] Salvador as well so that's on one end of
[15:52] the spectrum of projections I think it's
[15:55] the most aggressive that I've heard uh
[15:57] for me I'm I'm feeling that in the next
[16:01] five years I'm feeling that the GDP of
[16:04] El Salvador could easily double and
[16:07] could also possibly triple right so
[16:10] that's an enormous move across the board
[16:13] for a country uh the one that you would
[16:15] compare to of course is Singapore
[16:18] Singapore went from the third world to
[16:20] the first world uh pretty pretty rapidly
[16:23] and so we kind of think of ourselves as
[16:26] the Singapore of Central America or
[16:28] Latin America America uh and um so th th
[16:32] those are that's on the GDP side and um
[16:37] just like the day-to-day existence here
[16:39] can't forget that Salvadoran people are
[16:41] some of the nicest people in the world
[16:45] who welcome folks with open arms and the
[16:49] feeling here is one of positivity you
[16:51] know when you're in the states right now
[16:53] there's a feeling of dread there's a
[16:55] feeling of maybe we're not going to make
[16:57] it like this political situation is
[16:59] quite horrific and people are kind of
[17:02] depressed about it all here it's none of
[17:04] that everyone is very optimistic they've
[17:06] come out of a 40 to 50 year trauma a
[17:10] bare Market they've been gifted this
[17:12] opportunity to live life to its fullest
[17:15] and they are very hopeful and they are
[17:17] very hopeful people generally speaking
[17:20] you know that's their nature so we're
[17:21] seeing the true Salvador nature emerged
[17:24] as someone who is optimistic
[17:26] hardworking and Community oriented
[17:28] family oriented God oriented and you
[17:32] know this is their this is El Salvador's
[17:35] time important do you think is the El
[17:38] Salvador story for for for Bitcoin
[17:41] overall like if if if El Salvador would
[17:43] fail if there's no indication for that
[17:45] but if if that would fail to a certain
[17:47] extent how how how how bad would that be
[17:50] for for Bitcoin well in Bitcoin you know
[17:53] you have this concept of
[17:55] inevitability and with Bitcoin the
[17:58] progress and success of Bitcoin is
[18:00] inevitable there is no stopping
[18:04] Bitcoin Vector there's no human ability
[18:08] to stop it it's it's like gravity or any
[18:12] Unstoppable Force El Salvador is now
[18:16] because it's aligned itself with Bitcoin
[18:18] has become equally Unstoppable and
[18:20] equally inevitable you know El Salvador
[18:22] is now the one true indispensable
[18:25] country in the world not the United
[18:26] States that used to have that title up
[18:28] until a few years ago but now the US is
[18:32] dispensable you know the us could come
[18:33] and go and the world wouldn't change
[18:35] much but with Al Salvador the world
[18:39] recognizes that it is that North Star it
[18:41] is The Guiding Light The Beacon of Hope
[18:44] and freedom The Shining City on a Hill
[18:47] the Statue of Liberty is now a volcano
[18:49] in El Salvador so there's enormous
[18:52] Global Goodwill people all over the
[18:54] world are rooting for El Salvador and
[18:56] that has an impact you you can feel it
[18:59] and it's inevitable and it's happening
[19:03] it's so fascinating to to see and and I
[19:06] love the the position we are in right
[19:08] now uh with the the old system slowly
[19:11] slowly dying and the Bitcoin system and
[19:13] new one uh coming up do you think is can
[19:17] can it be peaceful uh can it be a
[19:20] peaceful Revolution with with Bitcoin or
[19:22] do you think the cbdcs the bricks and
[19:25] and the US Dollars and all those really
[19:28] powerful ful forces uh can can maybe
[19:31] make it not
[19:33] peaceful Bitcoin is a peaceful
[19:36] Revolution and so it's similar to the
[19:40] Christian revolution in a sense you know
[19:42] the message of Christ was that love can
[19:45] create change and progress and in a way
[19:50] that um is fundamentally Alters the
[19:54] course of human history and Bitcoin is
[19:55] similar in that sense but there will be
[20:00] those who decide to take themselves out
[20:03] of the Revolution right there when I see
[20:07] for example the midd East situation I
[20:09] see a lot of countries fighting each
[20:11] other none of them are talking about
[20:13] Bitcoin so I would assume that within
[20:16] five six seven years those countries
[20:18] will be
[20:19] gone uh when I see uh Ukraine
[20:22] Russia I see Russia is now kind of
[20:25] embracing Bitcoin a little bit so there
[20:27] there might be a future for them uh
[20:30] China is possibly going to completely
[20:34] reverse itself and embrace Bitcoin if it
[20:36] does it will survive if it doesn't it
[20:38] won't survive it won't be there won't be
[20:40] a China in five or t years there will be
[20:44] um 100 200 300 clusters of Bitcoin and
[20:49] Nat communities a coexisting peacefully
[20:52] in the world and those who don't want to
[20:56] participate in this Revolution Will take
[20:59] themselves out you know they'll take
[21:00] themselves out they they'll
[21:02] simply act in a way that's against
[21:05] what's happening in Bitcoin and the
[21:08] future will end for them they won't have
[21:10] a future that there there won't be a
[21:11] tomorrow for them and that's up to them
[21:15] everybody has the potential to be part
[21:17] of the future if they choose to be part
[21:19] of the future if they don't choose to be
[21:21] part of the future then there will be no
[21:23] tomorrows for them and probably no
[21:26] memory of them either they'll be gone
[21:29] really really cool I love that and for
[21:31] me it's the the the the Bitcoin price in
[21:33] a certain feed currency is for me always
[21:36] the indicat how fast that fiat currency
[21:39] uh is dying what do you think is the
[21:42] importance of of the Bitcoin price in
[21:44] Fiat uh terms in
[21:47] general well I think that uh a few
[21:49] things number one at some point nobody
[21:52] will take Fiat for Bitcoin so there
[21:55] won't be any market for Fiat to Bitcoin
[21:59] exchange that nobody will want it it's
[22:01] like if you go to Venezuela and you see
[22:03] piles and piles of boulevards on the
[22:05] street that have been thrown into the
[22:07] garbage if you P picked up half a ton of
[22:10] that paper and would anyone trade you
[22:12] Bitcoin for that half ton paper no it's
[22:15] worthless all Fiat money goes to zero
[22:18] throughout history for 300 years none
[22:21] have survived so Fiat money the current
[22:24] crop of Fiat money out there and I see
[22:26] um the the euro just lost to the Chinese
[22:30] UN in terms of global um usage right so
[22:35] the the euro is always been a very
[22:37] problematic currency it's on its way to
[22:40] being completely blown apart and going
[22:42] to zero but they all end up going to
[22:45] zero so um I think at some point two
[22:48] things will happen number one Bitcoin
[22:50] will be priced in Gold so you'll see the
[22:54] Bitcoin gold price will be the most
[22:56] common reference point for Bitcoin
[22:59] also you'll see Bitcoin priced in energy
[23:02] I think all the global energy markets
[23:03] will be priced in Bitcoin because
[23:05] Bitcoin essentially is energy and energy
[23:07] is Bitcoin this is the really the
[23:09] Bitcoin Singularity is about crossing
[23:10] over into a pure energy field where our
[23:14] vibrations and our energy exist
[23:17] post um kind of Fiat money world where
[23:21] values are determined by too many
[23:24] subjective nonsensical things and we
[23:26] enter into a more perfectly valid Val
[23:29] Consciousness and so you're going to
[23:30] have Bitcoin priced in gold and priced
[23:33] in energy but it won't wouldn't be Fiat
[23:35] money anymore because there won't be any
[23:38] Fiat money left any quoted anywhere it's
[23:40] interesting what is the for you the most
[23:43] uh important metric uh in Bitcoin the
[23:46] hash rate you know the hash rate shows
[23:49] uh commitment from the global community
[23:53] and the hash rate just hit a new
[23:54] all-time high so was close to 800
[23:57] terahash
[23:58] hash excuse me and um this is um showing
[24:04] massive commitment you know the price
[24:05] kind of vacillates up and down but the
[24:08] hash rate's been in a bull market since
[24:10] day one really if you look at a chart of
[24:12] the hash rate it's different than the
[24:13] chart of the price the chart of the hash
[24:14] rate shows extreme confidence really
[24:18] going back to the beginning the price is
[24:21] more volatile because remember Bitcoin
[24:24] offers two things that you don't get
[24:26] anywhere else number one you get
[24:27] guaranteed increase in purchasing power
[24:29] mathematically guaranteed increase in
[24:31] purchasing power against everything else
[24:33] every Fiat money gold property old
[24:37] Master's
[24:38] art cars stamps coins whatever Bitcoin
[24:43] is guaranteed to increase purchasing
[24:44] power against everything or another way
[24:46] to say that is everything goes to zero
[24:48] against Bitcoin and the other thing that
[24:51] Bitcoin offers that is rare almost
[24:54] unique to bitcoin it might be completely
[24:55] unique to bitcoin and that is instant
[24:57] liquidity
[24:58] 247 365 so the reason you see a lot of
[25:03] more volatility in Bitcoin than you do
[25:05] other assets is because you know a lot
[25:06] of times assets are over the weekend
[25:08] they're closed you know there there's no
[25:09] Market at all and the only way people
[25:12] can move value around is through Bitcoin
[25:14] and so there might be less liquidity on
[25:17] that particular day or that particular
[25:19] hour so you get some volatility but
[25:21] nevertheless you have you have
[25:23] guaranteed liquidity so that you you
[25:26] have some volatility but but you also
[25:28] have guaranteed liquidity and guaranteed
[25:30] increase in purchasing power so uh those
[25:34] who decried the volatility as a reason
[25:36] not to own Bitcoin haven't really
[25:37] thought about it much you know it's
[25:40] particularly if they look at the dollar
[25:43] and say well there's no volatility in
[25:45] the dollar and I'm like that's true but
[25:48] you have a mathematically guaranteed
[25:50] decrease in purchasing power with the
[25:53] dollar so you know um that's part of the
[25:57] game of the dollar is that it looks
[25:59] stable but it's leeching value every
[26:03] second of every day from your hard work
[26:05] is being leeched away Bitcoin is the
[26:09] opposite in that you are gaining
[26:11] purchasing power for your hard work
[26:13] every single day and yes the price
[26:15] vacillates in Fiat money terms is an
[26:17] indication of the weakness of Fiat money
[26:19] it has nothing to do with the weakness
[26:22] or relative strength of Bitcoin one
[26:24] Bitcoin equals one Bitcoin just like one
[26:27] ounce of gold equals one oun of gold you
[26:29] know gold is now hitting new all-time
[26:31] highs it's still one ounce of gold that
[26:34] the amount the supply the global Supply
[26:36] which is roughly up maybe 3% a year it's
[26:40] not dramatically changed from a year ago
[26:43] two years ago three years ago but the
[26:45] pric is up dramatically what what's that
[26:47] telling us that's telling us that the
[26:48] Fiat money world is is the losing
[26:52] confidence okay now if you look at
[26:54] Bitcoin versus gold well Gold's been
[26:57] around for for a long time it's got a
[26:59] total market cap of roughly 13 14
[27:01] trillion doar Bitcoin to maybe one 1.2
[27:04] trillion do you know Bitcoin is going to
[27:06] at least equal the market capitalization
[27:09] of gold in dollar terms so you've got
[27:10] now a 131 14x just to get to gold which
[27:15] is a lot higher than the current price
[27:17] and then of course it should exceed gold
[27:19] it should also demonetize not only gold
[27:21] but demonetize the bond market
[27:23] demonetize the property Market
[27:25] demonetize the stock market so now
[27:27] you're talking about
[27:29] Bitcoin worth 100 trillion 200 trillion
[27:32] 300 trillion the these are all
[27:34] completely within the realm of Highly
[27:37] probable going
[27:39] forward and so
[27:42] therefore um don't look at the price the
[27:46] price is the least interesting data
[27:49] point of Bitcoin it tells you just about
[27:52] nothing versus the hash
[27:54] rate or the difficulty adjustment or any
[27:58] the other
[28:00] underlying metrics of of the protocol
[28:03] are much more telling and informative
[28:05] about what's happening than the price
[28:07] the price is just a proxy for how about
[28:10] how quickly the Fiat money world is
[28:12] disintegrating if you watch or listen to
[28:15] my podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[28:17] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[28:20] the most important step is to keep their
[28:23] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[28:25] wallet my personal recommendation for
[28:27] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[28:30] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[28:32] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[28:35] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can

[29:22] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[29:25] secure sovereign individual in General
[29:28] and last but not least I have something
[29:30] completely new for you guys I partnered
[29:34] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[29:37] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[29:40] saw created by anyone look at that
[29:43] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[29:46] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[29:49] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[29:52] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[29:54] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[29:58] make sure to check out the link in the
[30:00] description for this amazing coin
[30:02] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[30:05] amazing I love them so much it was
[30:07] really hard for me to pick the one that
[30:09] I want to have because there are a lot
[30:11] of great options I went with the new
[30:13] transparency Edition they're all limited
[30:17] so grab yours those will not be
[30:19] available for a long time but there will
[30:21] come new models and new amazing designs
[30:24] along the way I totally agree and
[30:27] there's also this um I think Jesse Myers
[30:29] came up with that like the 900 trillion
[30:31] dollar that are in total net Assets in
[30:34] in the world something around uh that
[30:37] thing and what I always uh have the
[30:40] question and I love to answer to that
[30:43] how much of that total net asset of
[30:45] Bitcoin is exactly what we think it is
[30:47] and it is exceeding that um how much of
[30:50] the total net worth of the world can can
[30:54] Bitcoin
[30:56] subsume 100% of it
[30:59] what that number is I think is Up For
[31:00] Debate so I mean I'm first time I'm
[31:02] hearing an estimate of 900 trillion I've
[31:05] heard estimates anywhere from 300
[31:07] trillion to 900 trillion so this would
[31:09] be adding up all of the investable
[31:13] assets on planet Earth and um you end up
[31:16] with a very big number it's um it's it's
[31:21] all basically going to be demonetized
[31:23] against
[31:24] Bitcoin so Bitcoin Bec
[31:28] comes the unit of account for planet
[31:32] Earth well as well as the medium of
[31:34] exchange and a store of value so
[31:37] therefore you know I guess you know to
[31:40] extend that out a little bit obviously
[31:43] you would have let's say a Bitcoin bank
[31:45] which is something we're pursuing here
[31:46] in El Salvador you you are then
[31:49] obviously you know you're borrowing
[31:51] against your Bitcoin so you're creating
[31:52] a layer of of uh debt that to invest and
[31:58] you're investing in properties and
[32:00] you're investing in businesses and
[32:01] you're investing in things so let me let
[32:03] me retract my statement a little bit so
[32:05] I would say it wouldn't necessarily be
[32:08] 100% actually would would be into
[32:12] Bitcoin but it would be now thinking
[32:15] about this a little bit in terms of how
[32:17] an economy would actually function you
[32:19] know it would it would definitely be
[32:21] greater than 50% and
[32:23] probably probably cue toward 65% I mean
[32:28] this is obviously just off the top of my
[32:30] head thinking ballpark
[32:31] figures that's you know I that's kind of
[32:35] what I think so it's a big number
[32:38] obviously from one trillion to two or
[32:40] three or 400 trillion is is is quite a
[32:42] yeah it's a it's a massive fle and then
[32:45] I I've I've wrestled with with those
[32:47] numbers and uh like if if Bitcoin is
[32:49] money then it's like this popular saying
[32:51] like money is the half of everything
[32:52] then it's like 50% but I it could go
[32:56] well above that I think that's a reason
[32:57] able you know you know calculation to to
[33:00] kind of put some perspective on this you
[33:03] know then you then you can dig into a
[33:05] little bit more and make some more
[33:06] assumptions but obviously it's going
[33:10] higher yeah
[33:12] absolutely um uh one thing uh that is on
[33:17] top of people's mind I think especially
[33:19] when we talk about gold and Bitcoin uh
[33:21] this flippening happening and when
[33:23] Bitcoin as you said before reached the
[33:25] total market cap also of of of gold um
[33:28] first of all like I think it how
[33:30] important of an event will that be like
[33:33] the the old goal and the new digital
[33:35] gold Bitcoin uh and then uh do you have
[33:39] any estimates around what time that
[33:42] could be right well it is obviously a
[33:44] Monumental event and remember that this
[33:49] is an interesting point to kind of sus
[33:51] out a little bit so what what amount of
[33:54] gold is used actually for the purpose of
[33:57] store of wealth and that number is
[34:02] actually close to 95% right because
[34:04] people say that oh you know gold has
[34:07] utility quote unquote utility and that's
[34:09] problematic and for two reasons but
[34:11] number one it's if the any utility value
[34:14] that let's say use in electronics for
[34:16] example it's less than 5% of total above
[34:20] ground gold and substitutes for gold in
[34:23] that field are coming up you know being
[34:24] invented all the time anyway so it's
[34:26] actually not going up it's going down um
[34:30] so and then people say Well it has use
[34:33] as jewelry well jewelry is a store of
[34:35] value jewelry is not a utility other
[34:38] than store of value I mean people buy
[34:40] gold and have gold and gold necklaces
[34:41] and gold rings because it's a store of
[34:43] value it's not because you know they the
[34:46] fact that the this the gold can
[34:48] sometimes be bought and sold above the
[34:51] underlying weight of the gold on the
[34:53] open market that's yes that's correct
[34:55] but the but it's still a value
[34:58] proposition that you're making that's
[34:59] your store of value that you have and
[35:01] the people in India the women in India
[35:04] who have gold they buy it as a store of
[35:06] value they have a huge stash of gold of
[35:09] in India something like 20,000 tons or I
[35:12] haven't looked at the numbers recently
[35:13] so so so Gold's
[35:16] primary
[35:18] existence and use if you will is as a
[35:21] store of value so um Bitcoin therefore
[35:26] you know as a superior store of value
[35:28] yes it will catch up to gold in this
[35:30] market capitalization um You Know What's
[35:33] the timing on this I think that
[35:35] everything kind of goes back
[35:38] to the Fiat money end game right so the
[35:44] cbdcs as we've discussed is a way to try
[35:46] to extend the life of Fiat money and you
[35:50] know throughout our careers our our
[35:52] history there have been many attempts to
[35:55] extend the life of Fiat money you know
[35:57] through through various bailouts and
[35:59] through by changing the remit of the
[36:01] Central Bank by the Central Bank used to
[36:03] be there as a lender of Last Resort now
[36:06] it becomes a Speculator of first order
[36:08] right the the central banks have become
[36:10] not only the money printer but also
[36:13] using derivatives markets which are
[36:15] relatively new they are also guiding and
[36:18] shaping and buying and selling stocks
[36:20] and bonds they're they are the market
[36:22] the central banks and that's a way to
[36:25] try to extend the life of Fiat money to
[36:27] try to make it seem like there
[36:28] something's backing that Fiat money
[36:30] other than just um a lot of worthless
[36:34] debt so that that and those tricks that
[36:37] the central bank has employed over the
[36:38] years going back to Allen Greenspan in
[36:40] the 80s and then going forward you
[36:42] they're always coming up with new kind
[36:44] of programs and certainly during the
[36:47] 2008 crisis when you had a global credit
[36:50] freeze and the central bank and the New
[36:52] York fed came up with um ways to
[36:55] completely rewrite laws overnight to
[36:58] violate laws overnight make JP Morgan
[37:00] and Goldman Sachs Banks suddenly or I
[37:03] should say Goldman Sachs went from being
[37:04] an investment Bank to a bank overnight
[37:07] just so they could qualify for a huge
[37:08] bailout and also help Warren Buffett you
[37:11] know Warren Buffett is like one of the
[37:12] most degenerate kind of uh welfare
[37:16] Queens in American history if it weren't
[37:18] for the bailouts in the financial sector
[37:20] which he's mostly invested in the
[37:22] financial sector his performance would
[37:25] be that wouldn't be half is what what it
[37:28] has been it's he's most overrated money
[37:30] manager in history in my opinion so uh
[37:34] the ability to extend and pretend uh the
[37:37] fact that interest rates have been going
[37:38] down for 40
[37:39] years uh that the world Reserve currency
[37:42] gives the US enormous leverage all over
[37:44] the world to dictate Financial policy to
[37:47] again extend pretend to get the US has
[37:50] the dollar you know all these tricks
[37:52] that have been used U and now the cbdc
[37:55] is just another chapter and trying to
[37:57] extend the life of the
[37:59] dollar but I think that it's the end
[38:01] game you know it's the end game and once
[38:04] you have that Global Awakening that you
[38:06] know what the dollar is
[38:08] actually the boulevar it has the same
[38:11] value as the Venezuelan boulevar why do
[38:14] we own it why are we buying the debt why
[38:16] is Japan GNA keep buying this debt why
[38:18] is China G to keep buying this debt we
[38:20] we created the bricks we have the bricks
[38:22] we have our own currency soon we don't
[38:24] trade in the dollar that much we simply
[38:26] walk away from the dollar and that that
[38:29] kind of Consciousness can be sudden and
[38:31] it can happen very very quickly so
[38:33] suddenly the dollar has no bid the US
[38:36] has to buy its own has to monetize its
[38:38] own debt in in ways that are in in
[38:42] numbers that are historically
[38:44] unprecedented uh they don't they can
[38:46] don't won't call quantitative easing
[38:48] anymore which is just a fancy name for
[38:50] debt monetization of your own money
[38:52] they'll just have to come right out and
[38:54] say we got to print a 100 trillion or or
[38:57] more to buy our own debt and then of
[39:00] course the inflation goes completely
[39:03] Bonkers and the society collapses and
[39:07] this is what this is the game that
[39:09] they're playing they are literally
[39:10] playing the game of chicken with the
[39:14] with the
[39:16] indisputable fact that the rate of money
[39:20] printing a Deb accumulation happening
[39:22] right now will inexorably lead to debt
[39:26] spiral and death Fiat money death
[39:29] there's like there there's no question
[39:32] about this this is the game that they're
[39:34] playing so at that
[39:37] point you have gold suddenly goes from
[39:42] whatever price it's at to it jumps 50%
[39:46] you know let's say gold that points
[39:48] 3,000 4,000 an ounce gold immediately
[39:51] goes to seven or 8,000 or 9,000 an ounce
[39:54] Bitcoin immediately goes from let's say
[39:56] 85 90,000 or 110,000 per coin it
[39:59] immediately goes to 300,000 350,000
[40:03] overnight there's no Market there's no
[40:05] bit everything is it's the great it's
[40:09] it's the cosmic moment you know it's um
[40:13] when if you if you weren't paying
[40:16] attention you will find yourself on the
[40:18] wrong side of History suddenly and
[40:21] there's no way to get back in you you
[40:22] won't be able to go backwards you know
[40:24] it's the Bitcoin blockchain is immutable
[40:27] there's no rewriting you that's it you
[40:29] know Tik Tock next block you were not in
[40:32] this block right you know block number
[40:35] you know 1, 432,000 or whatever it'll
[40:38] have it'll be the ark block those are in
[40:41] that block and they'll be everyone who's
[40:43] not in that block but whoever's in that
[40:46] block their DNA will go forward who's
[40:49] ever not in that block their DNA will
[40:52] not be going forward so it's a really
[40:56] interesting game game theory of
[40:58] course and its Consciousness bending you
[41:02] know people really have to think
[41:04] differently to comprehend the scope of
[41:07] what's Happening here and it's
[41:10] been particularly in the US since World
[41:13] War II it pays to be dumb right
[41:17] stupidity is trades at a premium in
[41:19] American culture because if you think
[41:21] too much about it you would not do the
[41:25] things that
[41:27] others are
[41:29] doing that have allowed them to
[41:31] aggregate certain position in society of
[41:34] influence wealth and
[41:36] power right I don't I don't want to go
[41:38] spend too much time on that but
[41:40] ignorance has never been more profitable
[41:43] until it's not and then suddenly it's
[41:46] not and it just but it it happens you
[41:48] know things in nature happen in these
[41:49] Quantum leaps you know they move in
[41:51] orbit Quantum Leap and orbit right they
[41:53] go different they don't gradually kind
[41:55] of sachche from one orbit to another
[41:57] right it's is quantum mechanics it's
[41:59] either with this orbit that orbit right
[42:01] they that's and it's either one degree
[42:04] less or more is the difference between
[42:06] ice and and and water or water and Vapor
[42:10] that's just a one degree change and it's
[42:12] the quantum change and it's a different
[42:14] state of re of of reality for that
[42:17] particular H2O uh molecule is in
[42:20] different states depending on one degree
[42:22] change in temperature so that's that's
[42:25] typically the way nature works and and
[42:28] with humans because we have these
[42:30] Consciousness kind of malleability that
[42:33] allow us to create these fantasies in
[42:35] our own mind about where we are and who
[42:37] we are we Overlook the this these basic
[42:41] facts and but basic facts come back and
[42:45] then there's a change and then there's a
[42:46] fork and then there's a new reality and
[42:48] then some are there some are not there
[42:50] we're all heading into this interesting
[42:53] moment Cosmic Cosmic moment
[42:57] so I think that the the catchup of
[43:00] Bitcoin to
[43:01] Gold Can Happen very quickly based on
[43:04] what I just said in other words there's
[43:06] there's a huge Titanic shift so you have
[43:09] these big gaps big gaps big price gaps
[43:13] and that's how we get there and we get
[43:15] there can get there quickly and then
[43:17] we'll all
[43:19] be Michael sailor will own some kind of
[43:23] interplanetary
[43:24] traveling vehicle that will beam up and
[43:29] will be partying on Michael sailor's
[43:32] Intergalactic spaceship IO I love that a
[43:35] lot wow really cool and I think uh one
[43:38] um one thing that you have done over the
[43:40] years uh very successful in in a lot
[43:43] this orange peing people uh and getting
[43:45] people even very early in in in in in
[43:48] Bitcoin I hear a lot of people saying oh
[43:50] yeah Max Kiser was one of my first
[43:52] orange pillars um how can we accelerate
[43:57] the
[43:58] individual orange billing Bitcoin
[44:00] Journey we talked about a little bit
[44:02] about Trump he got now his first uh
[44:04] thing I needed three years to go over
[44:06] from Bitcoin is a scam to oh might be
[44:08] something we all have our our our
[44:10] Journeys um how can we accelerate that
[44:13] on a on a individual
[44:16] level you know the Bitcoin adoption is
[44:20] tied to urgency so in countries like um
[44:23] Argentina where inflation was running
[44:24] out of control it was easier to sell
[44:26] people on bitcoin or Venezuela or other
[44:30] countries that have gone through
[44:31] economic chaos or El Salvador so that's
[44:35] what drives adoption or your your bank
[44:38] just went belly up and you lost
[44:39] everything you know how how do I not
[44:42] have have that happen in the future you
[44:44] know do you become a bitcoiner so it's
[44:47] it's hard to to bitcoin somebody who's
[44:50] very comfortably numb in their Fiat
[44:52] money world living in the suburb
[44:55] somewhere and everything is subsidized
[44:57] either directly or indirectly by the
[44:59] government or what the government's
[45:01] doing and you're telling them no it's
[45:03] all going to fall apart you need to buy
[45:05] Bitcoin they're they're just not going
[45:06] to be open to that message because
[45:08] they'll be like I don't get it I'm I'm
[45:10] very satisfied where I am right now I
[45:11] don't see any of these problems you're
[45:13] talking
[45:14] about and so those people are hard to
[45:17] reach and um so it you know
[45:22] Bitcoin is doing its own job reaching
[45:25] the people it wants to reach
[45:28] in those areas that are experiencing
[45:30] economic
[45:32] duress and it's it's a accumulating a
[45:35] critical mass of folks who will be
[45:38] rebuilding the future after we enter the
[45:41] Bitcoin Singularity and the Fiat money
[45:43] apocalypse wipes out the considerable
[45:46] portion of the global economy yeah I
[45:48] love it a lot you I Al I also heard you
[45:51] gave a lot of Bitcoin in in uh orange
[45:54] pilling people uh away do you you have a
[45:57] regret uh when you look at that value of
[45:59] of of the Bitcoin now well there's two
[46:01] answers to that question the first
[46:03] answer is of of course I'm very happy to
[46:06] have spread the joy of Bitcoin to so
[46:08] many who are now enjoying such
[46:10] incredible lives and I don't think for a
[46:13] moment of ever uh what the value is
[46:16] today in that context of the joy that I
[46:18] feel every day from knowing I've brought
[46:20] so much happiness to people the second
[46:22] answer is yeah you know what the
[46:25] hell was I thinking I what is going on
[46:27] here wow so you know it depends on what
[46:31] what time of the day I I'll have either
[46:34] thought really cool um we have an end
[46:36] routin in the podcast uh where we have
[46:39] two questions the first question is
[46:40] always the same question for for each
[46:42] guest uh and the question is the answer
[46:44] is 12 12 why
[46:47] 12 no I'll tell you a minute but what's
[46:49] the question the question is uh what can
[46:52] we learn from you besides all the things
[46:54] that we already talked about be your
[46:56] authentic
[46:57] even if it means that you have
[47:01] to be an
[47:03] outsider it's it's better than being
[47:08] inauthentically part of the inside
[47:10] that's beautiful really cool uh the
[47:12] other an routine question is where the
[47:14] previous guest is asking a question for
[47:16] the next guest without knowing who the
[47:17] next guest actually is and I think it's
[47:19] it's such a soothing one a really really
[47:21] cool one um who who better to to ask
[47:24] that question to than than you yourself
[47:26] Max Kaiser how would you explain Bitcoin
[47:29] to a 5-year-old one you can't you can't
[47:32] you know this is um I know Einstein said
[47:35] that unless you can explain it to a
[47:36] 5-year-old you don't really understand
[47:38] it but is I don't think it's uh it falls
[47:42] into that camp really Bitcoin I think
[47:45] you know it's like the Matrix you know
[47:47] the Matrix story is you know you have a
[47:49] feeling inside that's an itch that not
[47:53] all is right then you have to take the
[47:56] the red pill or the blue pill and you
[47:59] know no 5-year-old is going to really be
[48:02] able to um it's not having that
[48:05] existential crisis in their lives right
[48:07] they're busy being five years old and
[48:10] it's not until really you know you get
[48:13] older that you begin to see
[48:16] yourself and want to know about what
[48:21] your place is in the world you know that
[48:24] happen doesn't really happen until
[48:25] you're you know in your teen teen years
[48:29] and your early 20s you know that's
[48:32] that's those are the years that these
[48:34] questions become more a part of your
[48:37] Consciousness and it's during that time
[48:39] when Bitcoin offers an interesting you
[48:42] know thought experiment about well what
[48:45] if there was perfect money you know what
[48:47] is money like these are pretty these are
[48:50] questions that philosophers have been
[48:52] asking for thousands of years and I
[48:55] think you know it's it's it's it's nice
[48:59] that Bitcoin really uses all of our
[49:03] minds and all of our ability to think
[49:07] critically about everything across a
[49:09] multitude of subjects to give us a
[49:12] greater feeling of being part of this
[49:15] life to get to enrich our life and um
[49:20] that's something that would continue on
[49:23] for the rest of your life and the rest
[49:25] of my life I'll say this
[49:27] about something I experienced at the
[49:30] having a party in El Salvador I got a
[49:33] question from the audience for me from a
[49:35] I think it was a nine or 10 year old
[49:37] saying is it too late to buy Bitcoin you
[49:40] know you are buying it at a dollar you
[49:42] know it's at 60 or 7,000 and you know is
[49:45] it too late and I thought about it for a
[49:47] second and it struck me that actually
[49:49] I'm way way too early because the world
[49:53] that Bitcoin is creating by the time
[49:56] it's starts to get in mature and we see
[49:59] what this is all about I'll be gone
[50:01] right I'll be gone I won't actually be
[50:02] living during the the Bitcoin era of of
[50:08] Plenty so um I was too early right the
[50:12] people who are buying it now people are
[50:13] getting into it now are about to enter
[50:15] into a life that no civilization has
[50:19] ever known before everybody you know
[50:21] pays the price gets the price they
[50:23] deserve so and so that has a mult
[50:26] multiple ways you can look at that
[50:29] both tragic as well as you know it's
[50:33] it's something really interesting that I
[50:35] thought about right now the age of my
[50:37] viewers as as YouTube and other podcast
[50:39] platforms give you really detailed
[50:41] analytics of about your your audience um
[50:45] I have I think five or Sixx more viewers
[50:49] above 65 years old then I have under 25
[50:52] and I'm
[50:54] 25 so I'm like the the average fewer I
[50:57] think is like around 47 something like
[50:59] that I calculated uh so it's it's
[51:02] interesting for me how how um mature the
[51:06] the Bitcoin audience is and some maybe
[51:09] it's also because with with 1520 you
[51:13] don't have those life experiences about
[51:15] the Fiat system about the bank system
[51:17] because your life is paid by two other
[51:19] people your parents usually uh so it's
[51:22] it's it's interesting how it goes do is
[51:24] that uh common probably seen way more
[51:27] fewer datas and stuff like that do you
[51:29] see that the Bitcoin audience is around
[51:32] that age and why do under 30 year olds
[51:35] don't are not as much in Bitcoin yeah I
[51:38] mean to flip the question around it
[51:39] would be like instead of trying to
[51:41] explain Bitcoin to a 5-year-old would be
[51:43] better to explain Bitcoin to a 65y old
[51:46] because they're actually in a position
[51:49] to gain more from it in the years they
[51:51] have left uh but to your question
[51:57] you know that when you're five six seven
[52:00] years old when you're 18 years old when
[52:02] you're 20 when you're 25 years old you
[52:05] really have this you do have this idea
[52:07] of having a limited amount of energy you
[52:09] know your energy is seemingly infinite
[52:13] and your body is completely coordinated
[52:16] and working as one expression of
[52:19] yourself your mind your body there's
[52:22] energy you know now in my 60s and I'll
[52:24] be 65 years old you know the body is not
[52:28] one unit you know it's a bunch of
[52:30] different systems contained in the the
[52:32] skeletal framework of your body and
[52:35] they're all kind of falling apart at
[52:37] different rates you know the entropy is
[52:40] setting in and you know you have
[52:41] different things are falling apart at
[52:43] different rates and you and so you are a
[52:47] miser about energy you know energy is
[52:50] something that you are aware of losing
[52:53] your energy so when you look at Bitcoin
[52:56] it you recognize that's an organizing
[52:58] principle it's like spontaneous
[53:00] organization in a way that's hugely
[53:02] energy saving um that you can not think
[53:06] about a lot of stuff and just think
[53:09] about Bitcoin that's the savings and
[53:11] energy um you can put a lot of your
[53:13] wealth into Bitcoin and take it out of a
[53:15] lot of other stuff that's a savings and
[53:17] energy because you're not fussing around
[53:19] in you know stock market and things like
[53:22] this um so you it's an energy gain so
[53:26] makes sense that those who are in their
[53:28] like you know 50s and 60s would would
[53:30] look at I think that's the way they see
[53:32] Bitcoin is that it's a way to to enhance
[53:36] and better use the energy that they have
[53:39] to live a more a fuller Bitcoin life um
[53:44] so that that's what I that's what I
[53:47] think is behind those demographics as
[53:49] you've described
[53:51] them really really cool uh usually in
[53:53] the end of the podcast I ask people
[53:55] where they can find you but I think
[53:57] everyone knows where and how to find you
[54:00] um is there anything that you want to uh
[54:02] shout out in the end of the
[54:04] podcast sure you know we've got a
[54:07] fantastic golf tournament coming up on
