[00:00] I've basically just like been around
[00:01] Bitcoin since birth as a 13-year-old you
[00:03] can have a Bitcoin account because
[00:04] Bitcoin doesn't care how old you are but
[00:06] you cannot have a have a bank account do
[00:08] you think you will ever get a bank
[00:10] account I hope I never have to get one I
[00:11] never adopted it since I've always been
[00:13] born with it it was always there I get
[00:15] pocket money in Bitcoin and I mainly
[00:17] currently use bit refill because it just
[00:20] works really easy to be honest at first
[00:22] I thought it was a normal thing and that
[00:24] everyone accepted Bitcoin so I didn't
[00:25] really know that it was like not widely
[00:27] accepted until I learned that when I was
[00:29] older I been at Public School I've been
[00:31] at private school I'm going to do
[00:32] homeschooling next year in public school
[00:34] I'm not really going to mention that I
[00:36] was on stage because I've been missing
[00:39] out on some school days to go to BTC
[00:41] Prague for example and that would not
[00:43] end well the secondary Headmaster she
[00:46] said multiple times to me you shouldn't
[00:48] be talking about this okay this is not
[00:49] for the kids to understand it's also not
[00:51] good that you're missing on out so much
[00:52] school for this because school is way
[00:54] more important it matters what you're
[00:55] learning in the classroom where I
[00:57] totally disagree I prefer learning
[00:59] outside of the class and Real World
[01:00] Experience so a lot of people always say
[01:03] that it's going to be really hard for
[01:04] the new generations because Bitcoin is
[01:06] just totally foreign concept but let's
[01:08] be honest it was really hard to even
[01:10] learn the banking system for a lot of
[01:11] adults now at Bitcoin conferences
[01:13] absolutely everyone I've met is
[01:15] completely open-minded and absolutely
[01:17] happy to hear your opinion even if you
[01:19] don't share an opinion everyone there is
[01:20] okay I respect your opinion if I could
[01:22] do one thing I'd probably try and get
[01:26] rid of those weird scam apps that use
[01:28] Bitcoin as their like kind of of oh yeah
[01:30] we want to attract more people but our
[01:32] whole thing is a scam so this is why
[01:33] Bitcoin is untrustworthy to a lot of
[01:36] [Music]
[01:39] people for the first time I had Ella on
[01:42] and she was like 20 years old so at that
[01:45] time she was the youngest person on my
[01:47] podcast uh then I had a few weeks ago a
[01:51] Ben on from uh you probably know him Ben
[01:55] uh from generation uh what is it called
[01:58] Chen C Chen Bitcoin for Gen or something
[02:01] like that uh he is I think 15 years old
[02:05] and now you are how old 13 or 12 13 yeah
[02:09] I saw videos from you where you were 12
[02:11] years old so I was like now you should
[02:13] should been 13 years old uh first of all
[02:16] um how did it come to that and is your
[02:20] generation as it's it's like you're
[02:23] you're you're actually living up with
[02:25] with Bitcoin like you only live on a
[02:27] Bitcoin um not stand up but since
[02:30] Bitcoin is here you only live with
[02:32] Bitcoin it's like we should call
[02:34] generation Alpha kind of kind of
[02:35] generation Satoshi um how how is that uh
[02:38] all coming together for you um so for me
[02:42] I've basically just like been around
[02:43] Bitcoin since birth because my dad is
[02:45] always been talking about it so I heard
[02:47] about it regularly to be honest at first
[02:50] I thought it was a normal thing and that
[02:51] everyone accepted Bitcoin so I didn't
[02:53] really know that it was like not widely
[02:55] accepted until I learned that when I was
[02:57] older and I mean I've been using Euro
[03:00] and Bitcoin both I use Euro when I can't
[03:02] use Bitcoin and I use Bitcoin when I can
[03:05] use it
[03:06] obviously um and it's just kind of
[03:08] always been around for me so it's kind
[03:10] of
[03:12] normal yeah I don't even know uh can you
[03:14] have a bank account if you're 13 years
[03:16] old uh no not really I mean I can kind
[03:19] of have a bank account but that's like
[03:21] parent controlled so it's really not my
[03:23] bank account it's my parents bank
[03:24] account so your parents just give you an
[03:27] access to the limited access so it's
[03:30] it's it's funny like it's interesting uh
[03:32] it's one use case as a 13y old you can
[03:34] have a Bitcoin account because Bitcoin
[03:36] doesn't care how old you are you cannot
[03:38] have a have a bank account do you think
[03:39] you will ever get a bank account do do
[03:41] you think that we might be in a Bitcoin
[03:43] world I hope I never have to get one but
[03:46] if it's absolutely necessary then I
[03:47] obviously
[03:48] will yeah probably um let's get started
[03:52] with the the one thing that I'm thinking
[03:54] about the most how we can get as many
[03:57] people as possible into Bitcoin that's
[03:58] why let's start there how is you in
[04:02] generation Alpha I think it's called um
[04:05] Generation Z I'm the very far end of it
[04:07] but I'm still j z wait you're gen Z yeah
[04:11] we are the same generation I'm the upper
[04:13] bound I'm actually like if I would be
[04:16] two and a half years older I would be
[04:18] generation Millennials uh so we are
[04:21] actually the same generation uh two
[04:23] years younger I'd be generation Alpha so
[04:25] we we we out of bound of of of Chen Z
[04:29] really really cool um yeah cool um but
[04:33] uh how do how are your peers uh um as
[04:38] they are still very different peers from
[04:40] mine when I'm 25 26 years old uh how are
[04:43] your peers thinking about money about
[04:46] Bitcoin uh and how different is that
[04:48] from from what how you are seeing
[04:50] Bitcoin um so most of them obviously
[04:53] don't quite understand the concept of
[04:55] money at like at all yet but to be
[04:57] honest I don't really understand the
[04:59] concept of fiia either um I try and
[05:02] explain them the concept of Bitcoin as
[05:04] much as I can I've even last this year's
[05:07] BTC prag I brought my best friend from
[05:09] public school with me to try an orange
[05:11] pill her which successfully worked but
[05:14] most of my peers still see Bitcoin as
[05:16] like a shady advertisement thing because
[05:18] they get weird advertisement from in
[05:20] general just crypto and then like oh
[05:22] yeah Bitcoin is crypto so you know put
[05:24] it all into one box so they definitely
[05:26] don't trust it yet but I've been trying
[05:28] to introduce it to them Andes you even
[05:30] had a a talk at Bitcoin progresses right
[05:33] yeah what did you talk about there I had
[05:36] a presentation about kids in
[05:39] Bitcoin and I well orange ping kids and
[05:43] stuff like that and I also had a panel
[05:45] with um the daughters of Daniel Prince
[05:48] and yeah Jack MERS I saw that that was
[05:51] the the pirate ship right yeah pirate
[05:53] ship I think it was at the same time
[05:55] where I recorded a podcast actually on
[05:57] on on that pirate ship really really
[06:00] cool um how um I think that your your
[06:03] your talk also was really interesting
[06:05] with Bitcoin uh in kids also maybe let's
[06:08] give a a rundown for for the people that
[06:10] didn't saw it or didn't were in prag um
[06:14] what what kind of points did you touch
[06:16] on and why was that important for you um
[06:19] so honestly I don't really memorize
[06:21] presentations as one I just remember
[06:23] basically what I in general want to talk
[06:25] about and I've done a lot of
[06:27] presentations by now I started doing
[06:29] present when I was 11 the first time at
[06:31] adopting Bitcoin in El Salvador and in
[06:34] general with all of my presentations
[06:36] it's always been kids in Bitcoin how to
[06:38] orange pill kids what it's like as a kid
[06:40] with Bitcoin and I usually try and
[06:42] explain it from my perspective as a kid
[06:45] because obviously there's the huge
[06:47] generation and age Gap difference where
[06:49] a lot of kids have a way different
[06:51] things of perceiving and viewing things
[06:53] interesting uh what is holding them back
[06:56] like what what's with like 12 13 years
[06:59] old like it's it's it's interesting for
[07:01] me because I didn't even ask the
[07:02] question what is money till like I was
[07:03] like 20 years old 21 years old so I'm
[07:06] I'm fascinated by someone even uh slowly
[07:10] beginning to craft what what money is
[07:12] and what what what Bitcoin is all those
[07:14] things like I'm I'm highly surprised if
[07:16] someone with like 18 or 19 years old
[07:18] actually gets Bitcoin FD is just it's a
[07:22] whole different ball game uh i l it a
[07:25] lot um but but how do you achieve
[07:28] someone at that age age to to to to
[07:32] understand what Bitcoin might be in the
[07:34] future for you it was normal because
[07:36] your dad used it right exactly um I
[07:39] usually try and explain it to kids by
[07:41] basically explaining it with their
[07:43] surroundings for example for me I've
[07:45] always had my dad around it so it was
[07:47] pretty easy for me dad has it I have it
[07:49] and it's normal but with for example
[07:51] someone that really likes football I can
[07:53] say hey there's this uh football game I
[07:56] completely forgot where it is I
[07:57] apologize but there was this Bitcoin uh
[07:59] football game going on and I can talk to
[08:01] them about that or people that like
[08:03] playing games I can always show them
[08:04] SATs man shamur and all of those other
[08:06] games and people that really like
[08:08] reading I just tell them here some
[08:09] Bitcoin books have fun I love that a lot
[08:11] really cool it's also interesting uh
[08:14] that uh you don't even like you you you
[08:16] get it but you also talk about it
[08:19] publicly I think were you not even also
[08:22] on on what Bitcoin did or how is it
[08:25] called now Mr obnoxious I forgot how
[08:28] it's it's now renamed I think Mr obno
[08:30] obnoxious or something like that like
[08:32] not native English I I can hardly hardly
[08:36] pronounce it um but but how did it come
[08:39] to to you being actually like a solid
[08:42] speaker with 13 years old so uh first
[08:45] the first time when I wanted to go on
[08:47] stage that was when I was 11 my dad just
[08:49] said in the car that he was going to
[08:51] this like Bitcoin conference which is
[08:53] called adopting Bitcoin and we both kind
[08:55] of realized at the same time like hey uh
[08:57] dad I never adopted Bitcoin and my dad
[09:00] was like that is so cool we got to get
[09:02] you on a stage uh so it happened we made
[09:04] it happen and then I've been invited to
[09:07] bitcoin podcast to just be on stage
[09:10] again and ever since then I've just
[09:12] either gotten more invitations or
[09:14] decided to go to this conference and ask
[09:16] hey do you think I could speak here
[09:18] because I really love sharing my opinion
[09:20] about it and I think it's super fun and
[09:22] I hope that everyone obviously has fun
[09:24] hearing me talk about it too wait at
[09:26] that point uh you didn't had a Ed
[09:29] Bitcoin so the topic was how you will
[09:32] adopt Bitcoin or I had adopted it it's
[09:34] just I never adopted it since I've
[09:36] always been Bor born with it it was
[09:38] always there oh in that way yeah that's
[09:41] that's pretty hilarious yeah because uh
[09:43] so you are 13 years old so like the
[09:45] Bitcoin price 13 years old was uh was
[09:48] like a few few dollars at at that point
[09:51] when you were born so that's few cents a
[09:54] few cents even wow yeah that that's but
[09:57] it was already there that that that's
[09:58] that's pretty
[09:59] really cool to begin with I love that
[10:03] you're coming so so so early um what is
[10:07] also um with with your generation I feel
[10:09] like they're mostly into um not money
[10:12] things as as as they should be maybe
[10:14] even um how how do you think they they
[10:18] think about other topics as some when I
[10:21] talk with people that are younger than
[10:23] 15 and I have a lot of smaller cousins
[10:26] like I have a lot of a big family and I
[10:28] talk with them they're really concerned
[10:31] uh when when we talk about other things
[10:33] than like climate or something like that
[10:35] they're really concerned about those
[10:36] things like oh we gonna save the world
[10:40] and we Are Gonna Save the climate how do
[10:41] you look at uh those things and uh do
[10:44] you already have like a connection to
[10:46] that uh climate topic with with Bitcoin
[10:50] yeah so I mentioned it last year at BTC
[10:53] Prague that I was actually at a climate
[10:56] like protest in my local like town um
[10:59] and I actually was talking with some of
[11:01] my friends there and we held up like
[11:03] some different things we also held up
[11:04] some Bitcoin things and had really much
[11:06] fun and last year at BTC Prague I also
[11:08] mentioned that Bitcoin is actually good
[11:11] for the environment which a lot of
[11:12] people don't get yet I'm not an expert
[11:14] environment list so I'm really not the
[11:16] one you should like be talking to but
[11:18] you can totally like do some research
[11:20] about it and there's a lot of people
[11:21] that actually like can tell you how it
[11:23] works that Bitcoin reuses the wasted
[11:25] energy and stuff how did you already are
[11:28] you using Bitcoin with your family on a
[11:30] daily basis do do you get pocket money
[11:32] in Bitcoin I hope I hope so I get pocket
[11:35] money in Bitcoin and I mainly currently
[11:37] use bit refill because it just works
[11:40] really easy because I have all my pocket
[11:41] money in like stats and then I can like
[11:44] pay wherever I basically want with bit
[11:45] refill but some stores like a local
[11:48] bakery in my like Hometown actually does
[11:50] accept Bitcoin too where I can just
[11:51] directly pay with Bitcoin and they serve
[11:54] really good stuff so really nice yeah I
[11:56] also have a small restaurant here that I
[11:58] like to go to uh inen where the the guy
[12:02] is a Bitcoin and he watches the Bitcoin
[12:03] podcast and then there's a Bitcoin flag
[12:06] outside of the restaurant and it's
[12:08] really cool um how does I never used
[12:10] actually bit refill I see more and more
[12:12] about that online how does it work do
[12:14] you get your Bitcoin there and then you
[12:16] get some so I'm not really great at
[12:20] trying to explain but I can try um
[12:22] basically I have my stats and I open bit
[12:25] refill and they have a bunch of like
[12:26] different um like vouchers basically so
[12:31] let's say it has a voucher for clothing
[12:32] store um I click on the voucher for the
[12:35] clothing store I say I want to spend 20
[12:37] in this clothing store they then give me
[12:40] a voucher which is worth €20 and charge
[12:42] me this and this amount of SATs then I
[12:44] basically just press wal of Satoshi to
[12:47] give them the STS because I mainly use
[12:48] wal of Satoshi um and then I have this
[12:51] voucher that I can just like show and it
[12:53] basically just is like a normal voucher
[12:54] that you can buy in a store and receive
[12:56] so oh so you can just uh buy gift cards
[13:00] with
[13:01] that the only problem with that is
[13:03] probably like when when you buy
[13:04] something for like1 and you have a 20
[13:07] Watcher so you have a lot of Watchers
[13:09] for for a lot of things then um how do
[13:11] you look at uh school um as as you're
[13:14] really into school and most people that
[13:16] talk about what the school system is are
[13:18] not in school which I find
[13:20] hilarious so I've actually had a wide
[13:23] spectrum of school I've been at Public
[13:25] School I've been at private school I'm
[13:26] going to do homeschooling next year so
[13:30] yeah um in private school Bitcoin was
[13:33] definitely more talked about like it was
[13:34] mentioned a few times and uh some of the
[13:37] teachers actually also mentioned oh yeah
[13:38] your classmate Sam was on stage and
[13:40] stuff we actually got to watch like a
[13:42] short video of me once um which was
[13:44] really cool but there was also obviously
[13:46] some negative comments from some
[13:48] teachers for example the secondary
[13:51] principal in my private school um said
[13:53] like oh yeah Bitcoin yeah got to watch
[13:55] out for that in the future super Shady
[13:57] um versus in public school I am
[13:59] currently they just talk yeah so it's
[14:02] this thing and we don't really know
[14:03] about it we should probably stay away
[14:05] for it from it and other than that I
[14:07] just hear small talk like the German
[14:08] teacher by saying oh yeah because I live
[14:10] in Germany oh yeah there's this Bitcoin
[14:12] thing I'm not really sure but I saw an
[14:13] advertisement for yesterday and in
[14:16] public school I'm not really going to
[14:18] mention that I was on stage because I've
[14:21] been missing out on some school days to
[14:23] go to BTC Prague for example and that
[14:25] would not end well so wait but now
[14:27] you're in private school and you will
[14:29] soon be homeschooled but the public
[14:31] school uh right now oh you're now in
[14:35] public school before you were in private
[14:36] school okay that that that's fun they
[14:40] they would not like that really
[14:42] interesting it's also interesting how um
[14:44] how she said that you you gotta watch
[14:45] out for Bitcoin in the future I agree
[14:47] but not with the sentence afterwards
[14:50] like it's a shady St it's interesting I
[14:52] talked with Ben about that that he
[14:55] actually um got uh kind of mistreated or
[14:58] not misted he uh teachers kind of talk
[15:03] down to him with authority like oh no
[15:04] Bitcoin is a scam and stuff like that
[15:07] without the teachers being really
[15:08] educated about that and and they just
[15:10] wanted to shut down the the Bitcoin
[15:12] topic uh even outside of the the the
[15:16] actual uh class so uh did you had like
[15:20] uh experiences like that where where the
[15:22] the teachers also like was like we we
[15:24] don't want that yeah in the private
[15:26] school the secondary Headmaster woman
[15:29] that said that is super shady and stuff
[15:31] um she said multiple times to me that
[15:33] like yeah you shouldn't be talking about
[15:35] this okay this is not for the kids to
[15:37] understand um it's also not good that
[15:39] you're missing on out so much school for
[15:40] this because school is way more
[15:42] important like it matters what you're
[15:43] learning in the classroom where I
[15:45] totally disagree I prefer learning
[15:47] outside of the classroom and Real World
[15:50] Experience so it's fair to say you're
[15:52] learning more in the Bitcoin conferences
[15:54] than in the school
[15:57] definitely yeah I think that's also
[15:59] better uh better use of it but yeah I
[16:01] guess the the bitcoiners would say you
[16:04] you you should be more on bitcoin
[16:05] conferences and the the the teachers and
[16:07] the directors want want you to be in in
[16:09] school that's that's kind of fair yeah
[16:11] that's exactly why I'm switching to
[16:13] homeschooling yeah that's really why why
[16:15] did that uh why are you switching to the
[16:18] homeschooling uh basically it's just all
[16:21] the teachers not allowing me to go to
[16:22] those Bitcoin conferences and I always
[16:24] have to fake sck to go to them which is
[16:26] really getting annoying and it's also a
[16:29] there's a so-called SCH in Germany which
[16:31] basically just means you have to be at
[16:33] school and if I miss out and they
[16:36] realize that I miss out I'm going to get
[16:37] into a lot of trouble probably fines and
[16:40] I really don't want that and we just
[16:42] think it' be a good fresh start for our
[16:44] family just to move to uh we're moving
[16:46] to England and do homeschooling there
[16:48] for me and my brother so my brother can
[16:50] also hopefully come to bitcoin
[16:51] conferences
[16:52] soon by the way you are from Germany and
[16:56] I've seen some talks as as as a PR ation
[16:59] uh and your English is so clear with no
[17:02] accent in it it's so perfect that I
[17:05] didn't don't even didn't even think
[17:06] about that you might be uh from Germany
[17:09] or Austria like that that thought was
[17:11] not even in my head I'm bilingual so I
[17:14] grew up with German and English both
[17:16] being my native langu language that's
[17:18] why I don't have an accent in English or
[17:19] in German the only language that I can
[17:23] kind of speak with an accent is Spanish
[17:25] but it's also very minimal yeah that's
[17:28] that's super cool I L that a lot I I
[17:31] wanted to ask if if that's from school
[17:33] but that's then from the parents and not
[17:35] not from the school English and German
[17:37] yeah yeah that's uh that's that's
[17:40] fascinating because I I had a lot of
[17:42] German guys already on and they're
[17:43] English and also my English it's not
[17:45] even close to your English it's very
[17:47] clear and you you don't hear that you
[17:49] are from from Germany uh that's that's
[17:51] really cool from everyone knows that I'm
[17:55] Austrian they they they think that I'm
[17:57] uh starting like sh Neer for some reason
[18:00] I don't hear it really cool um what I
[18:03] also want to talk about uh with you uh
[18:06] is is coool in general uh I think um of
[18:10] course when they're not allowing Bitcoin
[18:11] that's definitely not a good thing like
[18:14] they they should allow those topics to
[18:17] to naturally occur especially if it's
[18:19] not like like if you're not pressing it
[18:21] in in their own uh um how do you say
[18:25] like in the in the school timetable in
[18:27] the schedule uh but just as as a topic
[18:30] on the side then I think it should be
[18:32] fine I love that you also got the chance
[18:35] that uh people actually in the teachers
[18:38] actually watched uh your your Clips uh
[18:42] which is really really cool sign but in
[18:44] general how do you like the education
[18:46] system and and uh outside of your
[18:49] Bitcoin engagements so private school I
[18:52] have to say was a lot better than public
[18:54] school but I disliked both of the
[18:58] schools um I wasn't one private school
[19:01] until I was like seven so I can't really
[19:03] talk about it much since my memory is
[19:05] very limited um but I can say that I had
[19:08] a lot of fun there but obviously I was
[19:10] only there as a child so I don't really
[19:11] know how it was talking about Bitcoin
[19:13] because I just talked to my friends
[19:15] about like oh yeah Bitcoin exists but I
[19:17] don't really remember their response
[19:18] because I was so small um then in my
[19:20] next private school over where I live
[19:22] now I live close to Dresden in Germany
[19:24] um it was accepted by some teachers not
[19:27] accepted by other teachers like I wanted
[19:29] to go to El Salvador for adopting
[19:31] Bitcoin and my Spanish teacher told me
[19:33] you're not going to learn any Spanish
[19:34] there well El Salvador is a Spanish
[19:36] speaking country so I don't really
[19:37] understand what you're trying to tell me
[19:39] here um and then here at public school
[19:42] now it's definitely a lot I don't like
[19:47] it at all
[19:48] honestly so the public the private
[19:51] school definitely still gave me like an
[19:52] open mind I'd say the private school
[19:54] taught me a lot to think for myself just
[19:56] like my parents did um versus the public
[19:58] school more like okay you have this
[19:59] assignment finish it in one week and no
[20:02] questions asked if you watch or listen
[20:04] to my podcast on a regular basis I guess
[20:06] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[20:09] the most important step is to keep the
[20:12] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[20:15] wallet my personal recommendation for
[20:17] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[20:19] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[20:22] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[20:24] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[20:27] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[20:30] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[20:34] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[20:37] step is to really level up your
[20:39] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[20:42] have the most secure self- custody setup
[20:45] you have to secure your own devices you
[20:48] have to protect your privacy you have to
[20:50] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[20:53] on where you live you even want to have
[20:55] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[20:58] move move in case something goes really
[21:00] really wrong and through all those steps
[21:02] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[21:05] step by step and if you visit the
[21:07] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[21:11] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[21:14] out how you can level up your
[21:16] sovereignty and last but not least I
[21:19] have something completely new for you
[21:21] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[21:25] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[21:28] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[21:31] look at that beauty I love it so much
[21:33] coin vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin
[21:37] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[21:40] way to go out there and show that you
[21:42] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[21:45] Bitcoin only make sure to check out the
[21:48] link in the description for this amazing
[21:50] coin vigilante time pieces those watches
[21:53] are amazing I love them so much it was
[21:55] really hard for me to pick the one that
[21:58] I want do have because there are a lot
[22:00] of great options I went with the new
[22:02] transparency Edition they're all limited
[22:06] so grab yours those will not be
[22:08] available for a long time but there will
[22:10] come new models and new amazing designs
[22:13] along the way I like that a lot uh where
[22:15] you got a little bit more freedom but um
[22:18] when when you when you then switch to uh
[22:21] um homeschooling that will be really
[22:23] interesting maybe like revisit of that
[22:25] interview in like three years or
[22:26] something like that where you had a
[22:27] little bit of homeschooling I think
[22:29] there will be a lot of changes at least
[22:31] well with the people that I spoke that
[22:34] uh either were homeschool or uh
[22:38] homeschooled their kids the the
[22:40] experience is Tred quite cool like
[22:43] really it's like a a hockey stick moment
[22:45] in in in in their life at least what I
[22:47] saw a little bit like the the moment
[22:49] when people get get Bitcoin um when you
[22:52] thinking now about uh a generation that
[22:54] is only living with Bitcoin like uh Our
[22:57] Generation
[22:59] set or maybe even uh more extreme
[23:02] generation Alpha uh or maybe even like
[23:05] going 10 years more down the road where
[23:08] like people actually when they are now
[23:11] like five years old when Once to get to
[23:13] like 15 or 20 years uh Bitcoin will be
[23:16] such a huge topic if if we are
[23:19] successful uh that they might never use
[23:22] a bank account that they might never use
[23:24] anything else in Bitcoin um what do you
[23:26] think will that do society when we all
[23:31] when a generation uh grows up in a
[23:34] complete Bitcoin world where like the
[23:36] that there is no fear mindset in there
[23:38] because they never they don't don't even
[23:40] know what what fear is uh so a lot of
[23:43] people always say that it's going to be
[23:45] really hard for the new generations
[23:47] because Bitcoin is this totally foreign
[23:48] concept but let's be honest it was
[23:51] really hard to even learn the banking
[23:53] system for a lot of adults now and
[23:55] especially harder to then also learn
[23:57] another Bitcoin system system because
[23:59] you grow up with the banking system you
[24:00] think this is the way it's always been
[24:02] and then Bitcoin is like a total Whole
[24:04] New World and path for you but if you're
[24:07] born into Bitcoin and just you know get
[24:10] it from birth then for me I have a
[24:13] straight line for this is how the
[24:14] banking system works this is how the
[24:15] Bitcoin system works and if you're only
[24:17] born around Bitcoin and you don't even
[24:18] need to know the banking system you just
[24:19] have a straight line for this is how
[24:20] Bitcoin works and no curves oh yeah this
[24:23] is how it fits into the banking system
[24:24] this is how it's different and yeah
[24:27] that's beautiful
[24:29] uh what do you think is there something
[24:31] that uh with with critical thinking is
[24:33] there something on on a society level
[24:36] outside of of of Bitcoin uh in general
[24:39] when you compare maybe the the Bitcoin
[24:42] conference World versus the the public
[24:47] school world and that mindset uh when we
[24:50] have a world where uh the mindset is
[24:52] more like on the Bitcoin conference and
[24:53] less on the on the school side what do
[24:55] you think uh is is is like the
[24:57] significance of of that so I definitely
[24:59] want more people to be like at Bitcoin
[25:01] conferences because at Bitcoin
[25:02] conferences absolutely everyone I've met
[25:05] is completely open-minded and absolutely
[25:07] happy to hear your opinion even if you
[25:09] don't share an opinion everyone there is
[25:11] okay I respect your opinion I'm happy to
[25:14] hear that well not absolutely everyone
[25:16] obviously but as many people as possible
[25:18] versus in public school it's a lot of
[25:20] people saying oh yeah but our teacher
[25:21] told us to do this and it's kind of more
[25:23] like a dictatorship from the um teachers
[25:26] which totally of course isn't nice and
[25:28] and I'd say it also makes the kids have
[25:30] a more closed mind and since the
[25:32] teachers don't say that Bitcoin is a
[25:34] good thing for you um and say sometimes
[25:36] that it's a bad thing for you they will
[25:38] completely believe that because they
[25:39] don't have an open mind to research
[25:41] about it themselves it's it's um I Heard
[25:43] a interesting quote I cannot remember
[25:45] the exact thing but it basically was
[25:47] along the lines like if you allow uh
[25:50] people to have responsibility if you
[25:51] allow people to actually make their own
[25:53] decisions the quality of those decisions
[25:56] we will automatically go up because all
[25:58] of a sudden they have to think about
[26:00] that those decisions if we kind of
[26:02] constrain humans into a a small way of
[26:05] thinking then it's it's kind of hard for
[26:08] them to even make good decision if they
[26:10] cannot really make decisions and then we
[26:13] we have those small boxes and then we
[26:16] say like oh yeah like we have to have
[26:17] those small boxes because the other
[26:20] because the people are too stupid to
[26:21] make their own decisions but they only
[26:23] do stupid because we have already have
[26:25] those small boxes and that's why I
[26:27] always like those experiments of like
[26:30] what if we have a world where those
[26:32] boxes are not around where we are
[26:34] homeschooling kids where we actually
[26:36] have critical thinking as a normal way
[26:39] even like um Beyond uh everyone says
[26:42] always like oh we have a critical
[26:43] thinking crisis not like I think we have
[26:46] a thinking crisis like people don't
[26:48] think think about stuff and it's so
[26:51] refreshing to see young people like I I
[26:54] call myself also in in the cohort of
[26:57] young people even though I'm uh almost
[27:00] twice your age uh but no I'm exactly
[27:04] twice your age actually uh but yeah it's
[27:06] it's it's fun to see with with uh
[27:09] critical thinking and thinking it's it's
[27:11] uh really cool to see that you also uh
[27:14] already in in that
[27:16] category love it to see really cool um
[27:18] perfect then by the way is your whole
[27:20] family already orange pilled or do you
[27:23] still have some some people to go most
[27:26] of our family so my father obious
[27:28] viously was the beginning of it he
[27:29] discovered Bitcoin back in
[27:32] 201 10 2010 um he orange pilled my mom
[27:36] which somewhat Works my mom definitely
[27:39] understands and like accepts Bitcoin but
[27:41] she doesn't use it so much herself um
[27:44] then me and my brother came along who
[27:45] obviously were orange pulled from birth
[27:47] and my brother's three years younger
[27:49] than me so he's generation Alpha he's
[27:51] been trying to pass it on to his friends
[27:53] but it's harder the younger they get
[27:55] because the kids that young don't even
[27:58] understand that concept um and my
[28:00] grandparents are orange pills
[28:03] from both sides I believe
[28:06] father yeah both sides and is your dad
[28:09] uh publicly known or is he he wants to
[28:12] be stay Anonymous as he since 2010 in
[28:15] Bitcoin uh he is publicly known but um I
[28:18] I think I will outgrow him in numbers
[28:20] one day I hope that I will be more
[28:22] publicly known than him one day yeah you
[28:24] have to forbid him to to go on the
[28:26] podcast
[28:28] the one uh it's that's the one uh
[28:31] comment I got the most when I had Ben on
[28:34] my show um because he mentioned a lot uh
[28:37] that his it's funny he as a male
[28:41] mentioned that his mother was really um
[28:44] the the orange pillar for him and you
[28:46] your dad but just observation um and
[28:49] it's interesting how uh then a lot of
[28:52] comments came like oh you have to have
[28:54] the M or you have to have the m so on
[28:56] and now we'll have the the of Ben soon
[28:59] on so your dad should also be be in the
[29:02] show if he wants to join us maybe even
[29:04] now my dad also Ben so second Ben on the
[29:07] podcast or maybe a third I don't know
[29:08] how many Ben have been on your
[29:10] podcast a lot on I think he's the third
[29:14] one if he wants he can join us now if if
[29:16] is he ready for it father I'm actually
[29:20] in the middle of some work no
[29:22] worries yeah we we do that another time
[29:25] really cool um one I have um a question
[29:30] for you as uh we we kind of tangle
[29:33] around it a little bit uh but the
[29:35] question of like what money is and uh I
[29:39] I try to ask it in in the podcast
[29:42] episodes as most as I can um what is
[29:44] your definition of of money especially
[29:48] as you're so so young already um I'd say
[29:51] money is what we currently use as a
[29:54] symbol of like how much you can afford
[29:58] because we use money as the thing to
[30:01] trade so for me money isn't really it's
[30:05] not as important as it is to some adults
[30:08] I just see money as this thing that we
[30:10] all have to use because that's the me
[30:13] that's what we use to exchange currently
[30:15] stuff but I don't I don't think we need
[30:18] money that much like if we would be
[30:21] living in a world where we could for
[30:22] example like just make food come out of
[30:25] thin air and everything else obviously I
[30:28] don't see why we would still need money
[30:31] do you foresee a future where we we
[30:33] could be money less far future
[30:37] unfortunately currently but
[30:39] possibly interesting yeah I had this
[30:42] concept but I have a hard time uh maybe
[30:45] I'm too much in my fear mind but I have
[30:46] a hard time understanding if if there's
[30:48] ever a time in our lives if there's no
[30:51] money at all because even if uh we are
[30:54] really progressed already that there's
[30:57] probably always is some way of like
[31:00] exchanging uh value to each other I mean
[31:03] if we're so Advanced where everything is
[31:07] basically all the basic human needs uh
[31:10] are met but still at that point uh we
[31:13] might want to keep I don't know it's
[31:16] it's a hard topic I have no particular
[31:18] answer for that but you probably I think
[31:20] there's one straight answer for what is
[31:22] money because it can be interpreted in
[31:24] so many different ways and everyone has
[31:27] a totally different opinion about it
[31:29] absolutely
[31:31] wholeheartedly I agree with you and we
[31:33] have usually entertains in the podcast
[31:36] um uh two different things uh and one
[31:39] thing that I I want to bring up even now
[31:41] because I think it's it fits well um as
[31:44] you're so young when when when you look
[31:46] at Bitcoin from the understandings you
[31:49] have now is there something that uh you
[31:52] you would change about it if you like if
[31:54] you could be go back to 2008 or if you
[31:56] could have just an influence over over
[31:58] Bitcoin and network in general is there
[32:01] something that you're like that we
[32:02] should improve um I don't think there's
[32:05] anything to honestly change for my eyes
[32:09] I think it's going well the way it's
[32:11] going but if I could do one thing I'd
[32:14] probably try and get rid of those weird
[32:18] scam apps that use Bitcoin as their like
[32:21] kind of oh yeah we want to attract more
[32:23] people but our whole thing is a scam so
[32:25] this is why Bitcoin is untrustworthy to
[32:26] a lot of people I'd get rid of a lot of
[32:28] those and I'd learn as much as I can
[32:32] about every opinion on bitcoin so I can
[32:34] try and explain to everyone why I think
[32:36] it's going to be the best money in the
[32:37] whole world I love that a lot yeah it's
[32:40] it's a it's uh I I I hope that we can
[32:43] get rid of the SC it's actually a big
[32:46] problem those scams uh I think
[32:48] especially I talked with a lot of uh
[32:50] people from Nigeria and Africa in
[32:52] general there it was even worse than
[32:54] it's here here there was also a lot of
[32:57] scams especially 2017 uh a lot of people
[33:00] came into touch with uh Bitcoin as a
[33:03] pyramid scheme as as myself actually
[33:05] also in 2017 or 18 uh but in Nigeria it
[33:09] was uh seemingly a really huge huge
[33:13] topic uh really cool what can we uh as
[33:16] as one of the endro what can we learn
[33:19] from you outside of Bitcoin outside of
[33:22] the the things that we already talked
[33:24] about what are you otherwise also
[33:26] passionate about definitely love love
[33:28] for my bunnies I have three bunnies um I
[33:31] really love caring for them um also I
[33:34] love doing Digital Arts my dad's Twitter
[33:38] profile picture is actually drawn by me
[33:40] um I also love watching anime especially
[33:42] with my mom and brother even though they
[33:44] have a completely different anime taste
[33:46] than me and I also love talking to my
[33:49] friends and just being kind of like the
[33:50] therapist friends to help all my friends
[33:52] out and then you talk about about
[33:54] Bitcoin with
[33:55] them a lot of the time yes
[33:58] sometimes I can understand why they get
[34:01] annoyed because sometimes they do say
[34:02] Sam I understand you but can you stop
[34:06] talking about Bitcoin for one
[34:08] second uh do you think there uh do you
[34:10] think there will be a bigger topic than
[34:12] than Bitcoin in in your life uh at some
[34:15] point possibly but possibly not
[34:19] currently I'm um in German schools in
[34:22] e8th grade you're already supposed to be
[34:24] looking into what job you want to do in
[34:25] the future and researching I think I'm
[34:28] probably going to definitely be going
[34:30] into some Bitcoin based job and I think
[34:32] that this is going to be a huge part of
[34:34] my life and it's definitely good that
[34:36] I'm already starting young talking about
[34:38] it yeah absolutely you should definitely
[34:41] you should definitely get in into some
[34:42] kind of Bitcoin job in some kind of
[34:44] Bitcoin internship or what whatever
[34:46] there is there's so many interesting
[34:48] companies that probably all uh uh
[34:51] competing for for you to to work for
[34:54] them I think you you probably have no uh
[34:56] no problem there I think they they will
[34:58] be glad to to have you what would you do
[35:02] if if you have the the whole Choice like
[35:04] in Bitcoin when you could choose pick
[35:06] and choose whatever you want so I've
[35:09] always thought that like in general
[35:11] marketing jobs were really interesting
[35:13] so I think I'd go into some kind of like
[35:15] marketing job for example like logo
[35:17] designing or just like some merch
[35:19] designing um and I definitely still
[35:22] personally talk as much as I can about
[35:23] Bitcoin I'm not really on the developer
[35:26] side like my father like my father's
[35:28] really good at that stuff I don't see
[35:30] myself doing that but I see myself
[35:32] trying to help as many people as
[35:35] possible see it for what it is instead
[35:37] of just seeing it as this Shady unknown
[35:39] thing do you create your your own
[35:43] content currently not I have a Twitter
[35:46] account of course but I don't post that
[35:49] much yet um I might be doing it in the
[35:51] future but currently public school is
[35:54] really stressing me out especially with
[35:55] homework so not going to post anything
[35:58] yet but my father and I were thinking
[36:00] about making a YouTube account yeah I
[36:02] think it it would be great uh and I mean
[36:05] you don't have to overdo it you can just
[36:07] like post one video a week or something
[36:09] like that because uh you you still want
[36:12] to have a live also outside of Bitcoin
[36:15] it's probably good idea uh but yeah I
[36:18] think YouTube channel would be amazing I
[36:20] would love to watch it like if you're
[36:21] just like could be a a leader a thought
[36:24] leader even in Bitcoin in in within your
[36:27] generation and and really um guide
[36:29] people like what what to do and how to
[36:31] think about Bitcoin I think that would
[36:32] be an amazing channel uh and you already
[36:36] have great opinions about that so I
[36:38] think you should definitely do that and
[36:40] I hope uh next time I have you on you
[36:42] you already have your own channel and
[36:44] and you do the
[36:45] things yeah that'd be amazing perfect
[36:49] then uh by the way bunnies um just to be
[36:52] clear like real world bunnies like they
[36:54] they actually like
[36:57] one is Maxi one is Ella and one's Zoe
[37:00] Maxi is brown and fluffy about this big
[37:03] I think then we have Ella who's super
[37:05] silky and Zoe who's basically still a
[37:07] baby bunny in my eyes she's already a
[37:09] grownup but she's the smallest of them
[37:11] all so she's a baby
[37:12] bunny how old are those bunnies um my
[37:16] two older bunnies are five and my
[37:20] younger bunny is four three is okay
[37:24] really cool yeah perfect then yeah thank
[37:26] you so much already for
[37:28] uh for that one last entertain question
[37:30] that I have that is coming from the
[37:32] previous guest uh to to you what is your
[37:36] uh biggest life lesson so far it's
[37:39] interesting because life has been so so
[37:42] short but what is your biggest life
[37:44] lesson so far I'm not quite sure if
[37:45] there's one biggest life Les lesson
[37:48] because I had so many life lessons that
[37:52] I I lose track but I think the biggest
[37:56] is probably to think for myself
[37:58] my parents have always raised me my
[38:00] dad's an anarchist for example so
[38:01] they've always raised me to think for
[38:03] myself and I think that's probably the
[38:05] biggest happiest life lesson I've had is
[38:08] to just be myself and not let anyone
[38:10] destroy
[38:11] that what was that
[38:14] Anarchist my dad's Anarchist yeah oh
[38:17] Anarchist oh now I
[38:20] understanding I have a I have a bit of a
[38:22] funky accent since I used to go to
[38:24] private school which was an
[38:25] international school um so when whenever
[38:28] a Japanese kid for example pick went to
[38:30] my class I had a little bit of a
[38:31] Japanese English accent and then some
[38:33] Spanish kid joined my class so I used so
[38:35] I had a random Spanish accent so it
[38:38] always changes now that I'm at Public
[38:39] School some people tell me I sound
[38:42] really British some people say I sound
[38:43] really American other people say I
[38:45] really sound Australian I I'm a mix yeah
[38:49] I would have I thought you actually UK

[39:08] really cool I love that you grew up with
[39:10] with English I kind of want to uh it's a
[39:12] very unpopular opinion in in Austria but
