--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] Bitcoin will overshoot at a certain
[00:02] point next year hash rate kind of broke
[00:04] out of of that fouryear cycle that now
[00:07] it has a very high likelihood that the
[00:09] price also is breaking out of the cycle
[00:12] the hash rate has been continuously
[00:13] growing and at a faster Pace than uh the
[00:16] Bitcoin price it's only recently that
[00:19] we've seen that price is outpacing Hash
[00:21] rate again after having a couple of
[00:23] times the transaction fees were actually
[00:26] bigger than the block subsidy you see
[00:27] these big spikes in transaction fees
[00:29] around the bull market top and
[00:35] bottom said in the beginning that you
[00:38] work on an annual review of of the year
[00:41] which is super interesting for me um and
[00:44] this episode will probably come out
[00:46] either right before the year end or a
[00:49] little bit like in the first few days of
[00:51] of the next year uh which is perfect for
[00:53] an annual review what have you seen this
[00:56] year what are some of your highlights
[00:58] and and what was this year about for for
[01:00] you yeah so the annual review is is
[01:03] focused on mining right because uh my
[01:05] business digital mining Solutions is uh
[01:08] is working in the in the mining space uh
[01:11] and we offer various solutions to uh or
[01:13] services to miners so we help them out
[01:15] with their marketing efforts we we do
[01:18] side brokerage and sell Rec Space as we
[01:21] call it on behalf of miners uh and
[01:23] provide consultancy services advice uh
[01:27] but a big part of uh of of our job is
[01:31] education so uh we publish a Weekly
[01:34] Newsletter uh provide master classes
[01:37] presentations workshops uh and then uh
[01:40] each quarter we do a quarterly review
[01:43] which is usually uh a review in in in 21
[01:46] charts so quite compact going over all
[01:49] these type of charts and then explain
[01:51] where we are in the in the mining cycle
[01:54] let's say uh and then once a year we do
[01:55] this annual review uh and uh yeah 2024
[02:00] being a Haring year is obviously uh uh
[02:03] an event you cannot go around so uh we
[02:07] uh we look at the at the Haring quite a
[02:09] bit uh but also at the hash rate growth
[02:12] so the how much the the network has
[02:15] grown what what are 21 charts
[02:20] like so I I do a lot of mining economics
[02:24] analysis so it's I I used to do a lot of
[02:27] trading so when I got into Bitcoin in 20
[02:29] 20 or
[02:31] 2017 uh I did a lot of altcoin training
[02:35] trading to get more BTC right so alts
[02:38] versus Bitcoin uh charts uh so I spend a
[02:42] lot of time looking at charts doing
[02:44] analysis and that I've brought to the to
[02:46] the mining uh industry because there was
[02:49] not a lot of uh uh analysis being done
[02:52] while there's a lot of data out there so
[02:55] uh um these 21 charts usually starts off
[02:58] with price so what did the price do uh
[03:02] we look at uh at the fear and greed
[03:04] index we look at the uh two um uh
[03:08] two-year U moving average multiplier so
[03:11] we look at whether Bitcoin is
[03:14] undervalued or
[03:16] overvalued uh and price obviously is an
[03:18] important influence on uh on
[03:21] profitability for miners but it also is
[03:23] important to understand where Bitcoin is
[03:25] in the cycle in order to know how to
[03:28] manage your treasury right
[03:30] whether you're going to sell all your
[03:32] Bitcoin to cover your operational cost
[03:34] or whether maybe uh revenue from other
[03:37] uh in or other streams you use for uh
[03:40] for covering those operational costs
[03:42] whether you should perhaps scale out a
[03:44] bit of uh your Bitcoin position to to
[03:47] gather uh a pile of cash in order to be
[03:50] able to scale up your business your
[03:52] mining business at the later stage so
[03:54] price is uh is important in different
[03:58] aspects uh and next to prise we look at
[04:01] hash rate so the amount of computing
[04:03] power that's online and the impact it
[04:05] has on the difficulty adjustments uh we
[04:08] look at transaction fees uh which has
[04:11] been uh quite volatile over the last two
[04:15] years let's say there's been high spikes
[04:18] because of ordinals because of runes uh
[04:21] and other
[04:22] protocols um and and there's been
[04:24] periods of uh of very low uh uh
[04:27] transaction fees so we look at
[04:29] transaction fees um and then uh we look
[04:33] into a indicator which is called hash
[04:35] price so that's a revenue per computing
[04:38] power unit uh per day um on a on a fleet
[04:44] level mining Fleet level we look at beta
[04:46] H hashes which is a th Tera hases and
[04:49] the machines are usually measured in in
[04:51] Tera hases so we look at uh at that hash
[04:55] price action so how how much revenue can
[04:58] miners get for the computing power they
[05:00] have and where are we in in the cycle
[05:02] also because uh yeah this Revenue uh
[05:05] spikes up and down depending on where we
[05:07] are in the in the cycle um and then we
[05:10] look at the uh the Asic market so
[05:13] machine prices uh mostly compare
[05:16] different generations of Hardware uh so
[05:20] I think those are the the biggest uh no
[05:24] the most important charts let's say
[05:25] we've been looking at ETF flows so
[05:28] trying to put it in such an order that
[05:31] we can explain uh where we are uh in the
[05:34] cycle so what what factors are of
[05:37] influence for for the revenue and profit
[05:40] of of a minor that's super super
[05:42] interesting uh and I never looked at a
[05:45] chart outside of price and hash rate I
[05:48] think like price and hash rate obviously
[05:50] as as a Bitcoin you probably have seen
[05:52] somewhere like price 100% I think
[05:55] there's no no Bitcoin that never has
[05:57] seen bitcoin price chart but I I think
[06:00] most bitcoiners also have seen somewhere
[06:02] on Twitter or somewhere anywhere a hash
[06:05] rate chart I don't know maybe there
[06:07] someone out there say it's like oh
[06:08] what's hash rate uh but uh transaction
[06:11] fee I never looked at charts uh I look
[06:14] at the transaction fee but I never look
[06:16] at like the history of the transaction
[06:18] fee hash price ma machine price is
[06:21] something completely new for me ETF flow
[06:23] I
[06:24] remember uh back in the days in the
[06:27] early 2024
[06:30] I definitely looked at those and those
[06:31] were really interesting uh but now I I
[06:34] really don't care how much uh the the
[06:36] the influence of the ETFs but it could
[06:38] be an interesting indicator so my my
[06:41] first kind of question for for those
[06:43] metrics is I think the the biggest one
[06:46] that most people are interested in um is
[06:51] what is the correlation and the
[06:52] connection between price and hash rate
[06:55] uh in specific does hash rate lead price
[07:00] and uh I think Kent from SAS mining told
[07:04] me a few weeks ago in the podcast
[07:06] episode where he was here he he has the
[07:09] theory that because hash Rd kind of
[07:11] broke out of of that fouryear cycle uh
[07:15] that he now thinks it has a very high
[07:18] likelihood that the price also is kind
[07:21] of breaking out of the cycle uh is is
[07:24] that something that you're even looking
[07:25] at is it something that uh you can read
[07:27] out of price and hash yeah definitely
[07:30] and I know Kent very well I collaborate
[07:32] very closely with Kent on a on a project
[07:35] in Paraguay uh so uh it's nice that he
[07:39] was on as well uh like a previous uh
[07:43] hash rates would follow price uh quite a
[07:47] bit uh because if price goes up
[07:49] profitability for minus goes up uh so
[07:52] it's uh yeah more interesting
[07:55] financially to start mining so then you
[07:57] see miners being deployed uh which
[08:00] always takes a bit more time than uh
[08:02] than price or it goes slower than uh
[08:05] price can move so has rate was leading
[08:09] or following um uh price in 2021 there
[08:13] was this so-called uh China mining ban I
[08:17] don't know if you heard of it uh but
[08:19] China decided to to ban mining while the
[08:22] biggest uh yeah uh biggest part of
[08:25] mining was being done uh in China at the
[08:28] moment then has R dropped uh quite
[08:31] aggressively this was mid
[08:33] 2021 uh and and there you saw that uh
[08:36] price actually followed that drop in in
[08:39] hash rate so it was like a a Black Swan
[08:41] event uh coming from the mining industry
[08:44] that had an impact on on price um after
[08:48] that uh price uh recovered and also uh
[08:52] has rate
[08:54] recovered uh towards the end of 2021 and
[08:57] uh and then we saw something interesting
[08:59] and that's that in 2021 in that bull
[09:02] market there was a lot of funding for
[09:05] for miners so a lot of uh Finance of of
[09:09] uh or money was put into uh to the
[09:11] buildout of uh operation operations so
[09:14] facilities build out uh and a lot of uh
[09:18] orders were placed for mining machines
[09:21] uh so many orders that there was a
[09:23] shortage of supply and miners had to do
[09:26] future orders so they would uh uh they
[09:29] would uh pay already for an order that
[09:32] would come in three or six months later
[09:36] so towards the end of uh 2021 there was
[09:39] a lot of investment and then in 2022
[09:42] price started tanking right we uh turn
[09:45] it to the bare Market uh but instead of
[09:48] hash price following or hash rate
[09:50] following uh the Bitcoin price we saw
[09:53] that these new facilities came online
[09:55] these new miners uh came in and were
[09:58] deployed so HH rate just continued
[10:01] growing so there we saw uh that that
[10:03] correlation broke uh and actually 2022
[10:06] was a very rough year for miners because
[10:09] the more hash rate comes online the more
[10:12] people are competing for that same
[10:13] Bitcoin uh and at the same time that
[10:15] bitcoin price was going down um and what
[10:19] we've seen is that uh as of 2023 uh
[10:23] bitcoin price has started recovering
[10:26] however the the deployment has continued
[10:28] so uh the hash rate has been continuous
[10:31] uh continuously growing uh and at a
[10:33] faster Pace than uh than bitcoin price
[10:37] it's only uh recently that we've seen
[10:40] that uh price is outpacing Hash rate
[10:43] again and that's uh periods where you
[10:45] see Revenue improve for for miners so
[10:49] the clean cor correlation that there was
[10:52] before you don't see as much uh
[10:55] anymore it's interesting because we
[10:58] normally have like bitcoin price
[11:01] religiously follows that three years up
[11:03] one year down Rhythm uh since it
[11:06] basically started and we are now in 2025
[11:10] so like next year in 2025 or maybe this
[11:13] comes actually on first of January out
[11:15] maybe we're already at 2025 where we
[11:18] have a massive up year uh the same as we
[11:22] had 2017 2021 uh 2013 this this massive
[11:27] up year uh and till now we kind of
[11:30] Follow that structure and maybe we have
[11:32] next year this massive up year but what
[11:35] we then also have is a down year in 2026
[11:38] that that's kind of if if Bryce just
[11:40] follows the past movement that's just
[11:42] what happens um now the the theory of
[11:46] kend and and maybe you can speak about
[11:48] that is do you expect or expect this is
[11:51] always a hard word but uh miners have to
[11:54] a certain ex have to to a certain ex
[11:57] extent look into the future and see like
[11:59] okay does it make sense now to to sell
[12:01] Bitcoin does it make sense now to to
[12:03] keep the Bitcoin that you mine uh as you
[12:06] talked before with with those things do
[12:08] you look at 2096 um maybe being an
[12:12] extension of the bull run and maybe
[12:14] being the the breaking of of that
[12:16] fouryear cycle yeah I uh this is going
[12:20] to be my or this is my third bull cycle
[12:23] i' I've seen some cycles and uh yeah I
[12:27] think it's quite likely that will a
[12:29] similar behavior that Bitcoin will
[12:32] overshoot at a certain point next year
[12:35] and that it will correct and and then
[12:38] shoot overshoot downwards let's say uh
[12:41] uh so that I find quite possible um I
[12:45] think for minus we uh we don't only look
[12:49] at price but we also look at the the the
[12:51] growth of hash rate and um and obviously
[12:54] the block subsidy uh we just had a
[12:57] halfing this year but uh uh if you
[12:59] starting to mine you usually look at the
[13:01] Cycles more in in halfing year or
[13:03] halfing Cycles let's say um I I always
[13:07] uh when I consult or advise miners um I
[13:12] was take that hash price to project uh
[13:15] Revenue uh and then uh uh I I work with
[13:19] three scenarios so bullish scenario and
[13:21] a neutral scenario and then a a more
[13:25] pessimistic scenario let's say whereby
[13:27] the bullish scenarios is even
[13:29] conservative so I think for miners you
[13:32] should always uh assume that uh that
[13:36] Revenue goes down because that's what
[13:38] we've seen uh over the past uh past
[13:41] decade let's say if you zoom out you see
[13:43] that Revenue sometimes spikes but in
[13:45] general it goes down so you need to you
[13:47] need to plan for that uh and miners they
[13:51] uh uh they don't have much influence
[13:53] over Revenue right so uh miners don't
[13:56] have influence on bitcoin price not over
[13:59] has rate uh not over difficulty
[14:02] adjustment or transaction fees uh so you
[14:05] need to to plan your business focusing
[14:07] on on the costs uh try to uh to get
[14:11] power at a at a low rate uh a lower rate
[14:15] than your competitors um uh and another
[14:18] way to influence your revenue is by uh
[14:21] by working on your efficiency so that
[14:23] that can be the efficiency of the miners
[14:25] uh so these miners consume a certain
[14:28] amount of electricity uh to to produce a
[14:31] certain amount of uh um computing power
[14:34] so the the newer machines are more
[14:37] efficient uh and they will be more
[14:39] resilient to uh to potential downside uh
[14:42] in the future but I think for minor It's
[14:45] always important to uh uh to keep the
[14:49] the worst case scenario in mind and uh
[14:52] and not necessarily believe in a in a
[14:54] super cycle or whatever it's an
[14:56] interesting uh uh perspective that I
[14:59] never looked at like when Amazon wants
[15:02] more Revenue in a certain quarter they
[15:05] can make like a special Amazon week
[15:08] where they get like on everything
[15:09] there's 15% off or something like that
[15:11] and make a mass advertisement for that
[15:14] and their revenue probably spikes in
[15:16] that week uh because they can influence
[15:19] with marketing with sales uh that whole
[15:21] thing but miners miners can get more
[15:24] miners online but this is also capital
[15:27] expenditure uh uh which then can
[15:31] neutralize the revenue but if like if if
[15:34] the price goes down
[15:36] 50% uh and the hash rate still uh goes
[15:39] up and the difficulty adjustment still
[15:41] goes up you have to bring up a lot of
[15:45] more miners to make up for that loss of
[15:47] Revenue uh which also then brings up
[15:50] your cost and stuff like that it's an
[15:51] interesting aspect that I never looked
[15:53] at uh but yeah makes makes total sense
[15:55] for miners yeah the cost aspect is super
[15:58] important uh and then obviously a big
[16:00] part of your cost is going to be the the
[16:03] hardware right so the machines you want
[16:05] to have mining uh so uh playing that uh
[16:11] a hardware cycle well is also going to
[16:14] determine whether you're a successful
[16:16] minor or not um in 2021 we saw machines
[16:21] uh uh with efficiency of 30 Jews per ter
[16:26] has uh going uh for at the peak around
[16:31] $120 per teres and these were 100 teres
[16:34] machines so let's say 12 uh uh 12,000 uh
[16:39] per machine and today you can get those
[16:42] for uh for under 500 so um it it really
[16:47] is important to time your entry uh and
[16:50] also think of an of an exit uh if if the
[16:53] market goes up and your machines have
[16:55] doubled in price or tripled in price
[16:58] maybe it's smart to uh to sell a part of
[17:00] your your minor Fleet to have a quick
[17:01] Roi on your machines and then have the
[17:03] rest running interesting so it's like
[17:06] even like a trading game on the machine
[17:09] prices how long are those machines
[17:11] usually holding up is like five years 10
[17:14] years yeah so they say a life expectancy
[17:18] or lifespan of uh five years uh but what
[17:22] we've seen over the last few years that
[17:24] the efficiency of these machines have
[17:26] improved tremendously so the older
[17:28] generation that might still be uh uh
[17:32] working well uh might not uh be
[17:35] competitive anymore if you if you don't
[17:37] have the right electricity price uh so
[17:40] um yeah it it's not only the the the
[17:44] hardware it's also the the economics
[17:47] let's say that determine whether you
[17:48] need to retire a machine or not
[17:51] interesting and uh you have seen uh is
[17:56] it a more smaller minor Farms or is it
[17:58] the bigger small uh minor Farms that
[18:00] also do that game where they sell miners
[18:04] uh if if the price is high and then Rey
[18:07] them it's it's it's also seems to be
[18:09] like you you have to organize it you
[18:11] have to look at it it could be um maybe
[18:14] even like inefficient to to look for
[18:16] those stuffs or or is the volume so big
[18:18] that it actually makes sense even like
[18:21] unplugging them selling them going
[18:23] through the hustle for selling reing
[18:25] them at a later days that it depends on
[18:27] your cash flow right like how strong of
[18:30] a cash flow you have and how many much
[18:32] cash you have on balance uh I think uh
[18:35] over this past year it was a good period
[18:38] to uh to upgrade your Fleet or minor
[18:42] Fleet or get new or more ficient
[18:44] machines in order to stay competitive
[18:47] because the margins were very low uh
[18:50] some need to sell then uh the older
[18:52] equipment at at bottom prices because
[18:54] they need the money to uh to purchase
[18:56] new machines but if you don't uh have
[18:59] that issue if you can purchase machines
[19:01] and hold on to the older equipment um
[19:04] yeah I I I think that can be uh uh a
[19:07] play like now we've seen uh the demand
[19:10] for all the equipment picking up uh and
[19:12] in the previous cycle uh we've seen so
[19:15] in 2021 we've seen a research of older
[19:18] generation machines as well so uh before
[19:22] 2021 when uh or 2020 I believe when
[19:26] these anend minor s9s came out there was
[19:29] the S minor S9 uh which was a very
[19:32] popular machine there were a lot of them
[19:34] uh going around and then when uh uh when
[19:38] things got tough these s9s were uh uh
[19:42] necessary in order to stay competitive
[19:44] and there were a lot of s9s that were
[19:46] even given away uh and when the bull
[19:49] market started uh and there was a
[19:51] shortage of machines that's where the
[19:53] price of these S9 started surging uh as
[19:56] they became profitable again uh so if
[19:59] you would have hold on to those machines
[20:01] you could have sold sold them at a a
[20:03] good price later on so um it obviously
[20:07] depends on how much cash you have on
[20:09] balance and how how much cash flow you
[20:11] have but uh if you can uh when you
[20:14] refresh try to uh hold on to the
[20:16] machines to sell them uh yeah when uh
[20:20] when that bull market for the machine
[20:21] starts pick up because we're still quite
[20:24] uh near bottom prices let's say is is
[20:28] the
[20:29] is there any correlation between the
[20:31] machine price and and and the and the
[20:33] Bitcoin price or like how how how do the
[20:35] machine prices uh vary over time yeah so
[20:40] uh also there like there used to be a
[20:42] very strong correlation and in 2023 that
[20:44] kind of broke uh that had to do uh like
[20:49] uh one of the drivers of price for
[20:51] Bitcoin miners is uh for Hardware is uh
[20:55] is bitcoin price but then uh uh yeah
[20:59] also the difficulty adjustment has its
[21:01] impact so uh um yeah prices of mining
[21:04] equipment have been quite
[21:06] suppressed um there's a lot of uh of um
[21:11] yeah mid generation machines that are
[21:13] floating around so there's a lot of
[21:15] Supply to be absorbed still before we
[21:19] could see a a significant price surge uh
[21:22] but um yeah throughout this year we've
[21:24] seen prices trending uh down and
[21:27] sideways uh but now this yeah since the
[21:30] last uh last few uh few weeks when uh
[21:34] Bitcoin broke uh that 100K level we've
[21:37] seen prices picking up of these older
[21:40] machines let's say so it's more like a a
[21:42] leading indicator uh like a a lagging
[21:46] indicator of of of the price paired with
[21:50] the hash rate depending on where the
[21:52] market is going it seems like so in a bu
[21:55] Market it usually is lagging a bit
[21:57] because uh
[21:59] uh yeah you have this uh this big supply
[22:02] of machines out there right now because
[22:05] uh of the of the um companies that
[22:08] defaulted in 2022 and the companies that
[22:11] refreshed or upgraded their Fleet
[22:13] there's a lot of machines going around
[22:15] now so it takes time to uh to find Rec
[22:18] Space for these machines building out
[22:21] facilities is a slow uh it's a slow game
[22:24] so it takes three uh months for uh for
[22:28] smaller site up to 180 months or
[22:31] sometimes two years for a big site to to
[22:33] develop because you need oil permits and
[22:36] get a good uh Power contract and and get
[22:39] all the input so uh um yeah the buildout
[22:42] is a slow process while price can uh can
[22:45] go quite
[22:47] fast interesting and then uh there's
[22:50] also I remember hash price uh you
[22:53] mentioned that is then the price what
[22:55] what it takes to to mine a hash
[22:59] no so hash price is the revenue per uh
[23:02] beta hash which is a a way of of uh
[23:06] calculating the computing power per day
[23:08] so the revenue in dollars per Peta has
[23:11] per day and it's influenced by uh by
[23:14] couple of factors first is uh uh bitcoin
[23:17] price the second is difficulty and the
[23:19] other is uh uh the block rewards so the
[23:22] subsidy which is currently
[23:24] 3.125 uh per block plus the transaction
[23:27] fees well well is is there anything that
[23:29] you you could learn from from that
[23:31] metric yeah I think that's uh for many
[23:33] miners leading metric because it
[23:35] includes the different factors that uh
[23:37] influence uh Revenue so uh if you are if
[23:41] you talk to miners they they all know
[23:43] what hash price is and they could they
[23:45] probably look at the hash price chart
[23:47] more than the than the price chart of of
[23:49] Bitcoin you say a leading uh you mean in
[23:53] a in a ranking way or it's it's leading
[23:56] to the W's decisions
[23:59] uh both I think yeah it's it's uh I
[24:04] think uh one of the best indicators out
[24:06] there to calculate your revenue or to to
[24:09] see uh see what your Revenue could be or
[24:13] project your Revenue yeah oh yeah you
[24:16] can calculate okay how many machines can
[24:19] I get online you don't need to you don't
[24:20] need to create an Excel where you uh
[24:23] project uh bitcoin price where you
[24:26] project uh difficulty adjustments where
[24:29] you uh project transaction fees you can
[24:32] take this indicator and then use that as
[24:35] as one uh yeah one point to to project
[24:39] out your Revenue as a minor really
[24:41] interesting uh sorry that I asked too
[24:44] much but it's really interesting for me
[24:46] all those small metrics that I never
[24:48] heard before and uh what what we can
[24:50] learn from then uh the the the last one
[24:53] that I remember I mean ETF flows is also
[24:56] interesting but it's it's kind of
[24:57] separate from from the the Bitcoin
[25:00] direct ecosystem um the are the
[25:03] transaction fees uh how how do you look
[25:06] at them and and what are you learning
[25:08] from the transaction fees yeah so um
[25:11] transaction fees uh each having become a
[25:14] more important part or bigger chunk of
[25:16] the revenue for miners right so uh um
[25:20] we've seen uh uh at the Haring and also
[25:23] after the Haring a couple of times that
[25:25] the transaction fees were actually uh
[25:28] bigger than the than the block subsidy
[25:31] so it will be bigger than the 3.125 at
[25:34] the having there was even uh a huge
[25:37] battle for Block space um and and there
[25:40] were almost 40 Bitcoin in transaction
[25:43] fees so that's that's massive so uh yeah
[25:47] these transaction fees are important for
[25:49] uh for miners but uh up till now they've
[25:52] been quite uh uh unpredictable they so
[25:55] they've been spiking around uh order
[25:59] runes projects and and there's been this
[26:02] babyon protocol where people could lock
[26:04] up and stake uh Bitcoin so it depends a
[26:07] bit on uh on these uh on these protocols
[26:11] and projects that are developed uh other
[26:15] than that you see transaction fees Spike
[26:18] uh at the bull market top and at the at
[26:20] the bare Market bottom so if you're not
[26:23] into mining but you're into investing uh
[26:25] in uh in Bitcoin uh trans fees are
[26:29] interesting to look at because you see
[26:31] these big spikes inter fees around the
[26:34] the the bull market top and bottom uh
[26:36] reason being that there's a lot of um uh
[26:40] buying and selling happening happening
[26:42] at these tops uh and also uh uh at uh at
[26:47] the top and bottom there's a lot of
[26:48] trading so people want to settle quickly
[26:51] and they're willing to pay more for that
[26:54] quick settlement than uh maybe they
[26:55] would be uh during uh
[26:58] yeah accumulation phases or or or other
[27:02] other moments in the in the cycle so
[27:04] these these bull market tops and and
[27:06] bottoms are are profitable for miners
[27:10] wait so you're saying um to a certain
[27:12] extent You can predict the top and
[27:15] bottom uh for for Bull and bar markets
[27:18] uh because there has the the transaction
[27:21] fees spiking because there are a lot of
[27:24] uh buying and selling and moving uh
[27:26] Bitcoin around going on yeah so predict
[27:29] uh I wouldn't say like you canot really
[27:31] predict but I think it if you try to uh
[27:35] play the Cycles uh like longer term
[27:37] Cycles that's what I do as a Bitcoin
[27:40] investor I try to time the bottom as
[27:42] best as possible and then sell uh at the
[27:45] at the top not because I want to get rid
[27:47] of my Bitcoin but it will allow me to
[27:49] get more Bitcoin back later on uh if you
[27:53] uh want to time those Cycles then uh
[27:55] transaction fees can be one of the
[27:57] indicators
[27:58] I would say that can help you in in time
[28:01] that uh that entry or or or exit so uh
[28:06] yeah I always think uh you should look
[28:08] at uh uh various uh indicators in order
[28:11] to see whether the the box is being
[28:14] ticked and and the market is overheated
[28:16] or uh or maybe Bitcoin is
[28:19] undervalued interesting I mean I'm
[28:21] always completely staying away from
[28:23] Trading as uh as I'm just too frightened
[28:27] to lose all my Bitcoin
[28:28] uh and probably you should also not sell
[28:30] all the Bitcoin at the top even if you
[28:32] have a top uh but but you're you're
[28:34] still doing that or you you're now
[28:37] moving away from that no I yeah I still
[28:40] do that uh but it's uh where before I
[28:44] would do like uh uh daily or weekly
[28:47] trades now uh uh yeah I've seen that the
[28:50] more you trade the more you lose it's
[28:52] kind of going to a casino right the
[28:54] longer you stay there the more you lose
[28:56] so I've uh what I've been focusing on is
[28:59] is more these longer term cycle so I I
[29:02] kind of uh learned when would when is a
[29:05] good time to buy and then usually I
[29:08] scale in uh and then uh yeah when we're
[29:12] in that uh mid-range let's say I I don't
[29:15] do anything and uh uh yeah try to time
[29:18] the the Top If I don't need to sell I
[29:21] don't sell too much but uh uh yeah
[29:24] that's kind of how I look at it at these
[29:25] longer term Cycles uh and for me
[29:28] personally less trading is better uh
[29:31] because it's it's always been uh like a
[29:34] something on the side I think if you
[29:35] want to be a good Trader you need to be
[29:38] dedicated to it and uh be focusing on
[29:40] the charts and be disciplined in uh in
[29:42] your trading strategies interesting
[29:46] um that that's like I I should maybe
[29:50] because I'm just going all in all the
[29:52] time as as much as I have bare Market bu
[29:55] Market it it does hurt a lot a lot in
[29:57] the in the bull market and in the bare
[29:59] Market because never have more to to
[30:02] shoot in more uh but it's just like uh
[30:06] my my calmness of my mind is is really a
[30:09] lot of value for like that that's the
[30:12] main own goals right like on style so
[30:17] yeah I I think that's most important
[30:20] think of why are you accumulating
[30:22] Bitcoin I mean if you if you want to
[30:24] accumulate Bitcoin to hold on for the
[30:26] next 10 uh 10 years why why even bother
[30:30] trying to uh to play the Cycles uh
[30:33] because uh yeah you'll never sell the
[30:36] top and you'll never time the bottom if
[30:39] you do you're you're lucky like it's
[30:41] always in hindsight that you can see
[30:43] where you timed it well but uh yeah so
[30:46] each each its own uh but yeah I agree
[30:50] the less you do the more the more calm
[30:53] you are and less focused you are on on
[30:55] the price chart as well I partnered with
[30:58] coin vigilante this is the most
[31:01] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:04] saw created by anyone look at that

[33:09] I like to focus on just providing value
[33:11] and just providing this and uh being
[33:14] there for a family and uh Less on charts
[33:17] as I also have no clue about
[33:20] charts but that's just me yeah um yeah
[33:23] uh you also are I think if if people
[33:27] know how Dutch sounds people will
[33:29] recognize that you're
[33:31] Dutch hard to get rid of acent yeah yeah
[33:35] I I will also never get like people will
[33:38] will know that I'm from Austria probably
[33:40] I think if you're at the young age you
[33:42] live in a English speaking country then
[33:44] it's possible
[33:45] but yeah yeah I mean uh one of the
[33:50] famous examples that uh some some also
[33:54] compare me to is is
[33:56] schwarzeneger and he has been so long
[33:59] already in America and you can still
[34:01] hear it so clearly like he he he and he
[34:04] took lessons uh and his story is really
[34:07] interesting because he took lessons to
[34:09] get rid of his accent uh because at
[34:12] first it was a a challenge for him to
[34:14] get movies and to get into things
[34:17] because of his accent yeah and and and
[34:20] people said like oh like that sounds so
[34:22] weird you you can never get an American
[34:24] movie now it's his signature and now
[34:26] it's like he's famous for that um but he
[34:29] really wanted to get it's beautiful to
[34:31] have different accents as well right
[34:33] like uh it's uh yeah it's a part of
[34:37] being a global citizen I guess
[34:40] absolutely it's really good to have the
[34:41] Accents in there and actually I never
[34:44] had anyone complaining like I I never
[34:46] had a single comment saying anything bad
[34:50] about oh your accent sounds weird there
[34:53] are some comments that say like oh like
[34:56] if you say that word try to pronounce it
[34:58] like that like people trying to help me
[35:01] uh especially with elent I I I speak it
[35:04] really badly uh but then there's even a
[35:07] debate going on and someone's like oh
[35:09] try to say that word like that and then
[35:11] it's like oh no like leave him alone
[35:13] like he he he will never say other
[35:16] direction it's it's great how he says it
[35:18] so it's fun for me yeah so I I live in
[35:22] Argentina and here like I speak Spanish
[35:24] as well and sometimes there's English
[35:26] words that they use uh and I need to
[35:28] pronounce it in a Spanish way because
[35:31] otherwise they don't uh understand it so
[35:33] there's this little uh English words
[35:36] that they use but then pronunciate with
[35:39] a heavy Spanish accent it's super
[35:42] interesting where I have an an Indian
[35:44] girlfriend and she speaks Hindi uh and
[35:48] sometimes she learns really good German
[35:51] but sometimes she like we are speaking
[35:53] only English usually and sometimes she
[35:55] speaks like one two German words and I
[35:56] don't understand it because I'm used to
[36:00] listen to her in English and then when
[36:02] she says a normal German word I'm
[36:04] like what did you
[36:06] say but yeah so my my wife is Argentine
[36:09] and she uh she lived in the nland for 15
[36:12] years or 16 years she learned Dutch
[36:15] which is very hard uh and uh she had to
[36:20] unlearn how to speak because Spanish is
[36:22] very quick and uh she uses a lot of
[36:24] gestures and she would speak very well
[36:27] Dutch but the Dutch wouldn't understand
[36:29] it because of her speed of speaking and
[36:32] then also her her body language right so
[36:34] she had to uh become this other person
[36:37] in order for the Dutch to understand her
[36:39] was she the reason you moved to
[36:40] Argentina or was it chavier m no uh it
[36:44] was my wife yeah she lived in the nland
[36:47] for 16 years and um wanted to go back
[36:51] already for a while so we we planned for
[36:53] it uh and uh yeah we we uh moved counter
[36:58] cyclical let's say so we moved here when
[37:00] uh artina was really at rock bottom and
[37:03] now things are are starting to to become
[37:05] better I think it was a when did you
[37:08] move it feels like you timed it nicely
[37:11] yeah three and a half in September it
[37:13] was three years ago that that's a great
[37:15] move how how did you how do you see
[37:17] Argentina right now and then what's
[37:19] going on with with Javier
[37:21] M yeah so uh uh it's been a very rough
[37:26] year uh I I mean he uh he campaigned
[37:29] with his chainsaw right so uh he really
[37:32] put in the chainsaw into everything so
[37:36] um yeah in order for things to become
[37:39] better they yeah there there had to be
[37:41] some painful decisions to be made and uh
[37:44] he really ripped off the Band-Aids uh
[37:46] instead of uh yeah doing it bit bit by
[37:50] bit uh he he did almost everything at
[37:52] once so uh uh we've seen inflation Spike
[37:56] uh in the in the first part of the Year
[37:59] there was actually coming out of the
[38:01] previous administration but then he man
[38:03] managed to turn the turn the government
[38:07] the the budget deficit into a surplus so
[38:10] that had a big effect on uh on the
[38:12] inflation and it uh it's been now single
[38:15] digits month over month inflation single
[38:17] digits
[38:19] for almost a half year I would say um so
[38:23] there was a period where we had 300%
[38:25] inflation uh per year so it's really
[38:28] crazy um and then also uh um you see
[38:32] that the the dollar uh and Euro value um
[38:37] has been stabilizing uh um if you want
[38:40] to buy pesos so the peso has become uh
[38:43] it's first it weakened and then now it's
[38:46] becoming stronger again so that's also
[38:48] interesting to see does he actually go
[38:51] ahead and as is that destroy the central
[38:54] bank and dollarize the
[38:56] country um yeah so uh he's opening up U
[39:01] all types of payments so he he has
[39:04] currencies complete in order to see what
[39:06] what uh comes um yeah which currency
[39:09] comes out as the strongest there is
[39:11] already a strong influence of the dollar
[39:14] here in in Argentina uh so the PESA uh
[39:18] has lost a lot of value so uh when I
[39:21] came here for the first time in
[39:23] 201 11 something like that uh I would at
[39:27] uh uh 12 uh pesos for a dollar uh right
[39:32] now this week I exchange for for
[39:36] 1150 pesos per dollars just to to get a
[39:40] grasp of how much value the PES lost in
[39:43] Compares it to the dollar um but many
[39:46] people uh see the dollar here as a hard
[39:49] currency which is funny for us
[39:50] bitcoiners to see the dollar as a hard
[39:52] currency uh people exchange the the PES
[39:55] they have into uh to to Dollars uh they
[39:59] take it out of the bank because they uh
[40:01] they don't trust the banks here many
[40:03] lost their money in 2001 when there was
[40:06] a big Bank Run um so people uh have
[40:10] dollars as their U yeah hard currency
[40:14] and store of value and then uh hidden in
[40:17] the house or on a foreign foreign bank
[40:20] account
[40:22] um right now uh what one of the things
[40:25] melee did was saying okay that you can
[40:29] um there's a lot of informal informal uh
[40:33] big informal economy here so a lot of
[40:35] tax evasion let's say people don't pay
[40:38] their tax uh people have money abroad
[40:41] that's not being declared so uh uh in
[40:44] November or the bit before November he
[40:46] said okay everybody can bring in all the
[40:49] cash they want from abroad uh and they
[40:53] call it a Blan chos so they they could
[40:56] uh turn that black money into white uh
[40:59] they could launder it let's say
[41:02] officially uh and they wouldn't get any
[41:04] fines so I think there was a very strong
[41:06] move by him because many argentines took
[41:08] their dollars from foreign accounts
[41:11] pulled it into the country and uh now
[41:13] also they they have these dollars and
[41:15] they're looking to to invest and make a
[41:17] return on those dollars as well so I
[41:20] think that's been a very strong move of
[41:22] of his as well and then there's a lot of
[41:24] privatization going on so uh Oil Field
[41:28] concessions were privatized they're
[41:29] working on privatizing banks uh the
[41:33] airlines is one of the H topics uh they
[41:36] want to privatize the
[41:38] airlines um yeah eliminate the Central
[41:41] Bank uh I don't know exactly what the
[41:43] status is of it but uh it might happen I
[41:46] mean if M says
[41:47] something it's very likely that he will
[41:50] do it so it's interesting uh the move of
[41:54] getting uh money this that sits abroad
[41:58] back in the country is super clever
[42:00] that's just great um a socialist would
[42:03] never do that socially say like oh those
[42:06] those bad people getting money outside
[42:09] of the country like that that's that's a
[42:11] really great move of him that benefits
[42:15] uh the people that benefits the country
[42:17] that benefits basically everyone uh in
[42:20] in Argentina and actually uh pulls money
[42:23] and power away from the other countries
[42:25] back into Argentina it's a it's an
[42:27] amazing move yeah I think also like a
[42:30] lot of argentines had and have money
[42:32] abroad because it was not safe here in
[42:35] Argentina you couldn't have it in the
[42:36] bank so uh if you have hundreds of
[42:39] thousands of dollars you don't want to
[42:40] have that in your house or uh maybe you
[42:43] can rent
[42:45] a how do you call it like a save in a
[42:47] bank or something but uh yeah there's a
[42:50] reason why argentines were having that
[42:53] money abroad and there's a reason why
[42:55] there's such a big informal uh
[42:57] economy and that that has to do with all
[43:00] the taxations that that there a big part
[43:04] of it still there but they're they're
[43:06] improving it but uh yeah if you want to
[43:09] survive uh or at least in the previous
[43:12] decade if you wanted to survive in
[43:14] Argentina uh yeah being uh part of the
[43:17] of the formal economy is is quite
[43:20] tough
[43:21] absolutely I do I do believe that uh
[43:24] it's it's super interesting what's going
[43:26] on is also then no C gains taxs on on on
[43:29] any assets like Bitcoin that uh uh no
[43:33] that you would have to talk to an
[43:35] accountant about that I know there's
[43:37] certain rules uh with regard to bitcoin
[43:40] I actually don't know let's look it up C
[43:43] gain tax
[43:45] argena so with houses with real estate
[43:48] it it it uh it depends so what when did
[43:51] you buy a real estate before you sell
[43:54] sell it where you pay taxes on that it
[43:57] seems like there's like an income tax on
[44:00] on on that with 15% we yeah I I also
[44:03] cannot find it out quickly
[44:06] so maybe someone in the comments can can
[44:10] still I know that that that there's
[44:12] people working on it but it's still a
[44:14] gray area also like depends where your
[44:16] accountant has a real estate background
[44:18] or whatever kind of background is how
[44:20] they look at the at the asset and how
[44:22] it's being taxed uh but I don't think a
[44:26] lot of people declare their
[44:29] Bitcoin here in
[44:31] Argentina I I talked to someone from
[44:34] Argentina uh recently on the podcast and
[44:36] he basically said um there are really
[44:40] strict rules at some points but nobody
[44:43] follows St it's like encourag that you
[44:45] don't declare stuff and and everyone is
[44:48] kind of okay and normalized with um just
[44:52] being outside of the the the legal
[44:56] system at some points
[44:57] yeah so uh I think uh because of the
[45:00] socialist government that's been here
[45:02] for many years like there's been a
[45:05] overregulation like there's so many
[45:09] uh uh laws and rules like uh that it's
[45:13] makes your life more difficult so people
[45:15] start to uh go around these uh these
[45:18] rules right so and it's very uh very
[45:22] normal also um
[45:25] yeah interesting a cultural thing like I
[45:28] don't know how quickly it changes but uh
[45:31] not paying taxes for for somebody from
[45:34] the Netherlands might uh yeah it's not
[45:37] that common while here it's it's very
[45:39] common and I even seen uh people
[45:42] starting their career that wanted to
[45:44] work in a formal way but they were
[45:47] offered their contracts uh half formal
[45:50] half informal or completely informal and
[45:53] then it it it's uh working against them
[45:56] in the in building that career also did
[45:58] your I think your internet cut for for a
[46:03] moment yeah but no worries uh really
[46:06] cool is is Argentina a good place to to
[46:09] mine Bitcoin are you mining uh Bitcoin
[46:11] in in in
[46:12] Argentina uh so it used to be because
[46:15] there was a big subsidy on uh on power
[46:19] right so uh before everything was
[46:21] subsidized uh because the the previous
[46:24] government liked to to give away
[46:26] presents and
[46:27] the subsidy on the power was taken away
[46:30] by uh by the government of mle um so uh
[46:35] electricity became more expensive and
[46:37] then that happened around the halfing so
[46:40] uh yeah it was kind of a double blow for
[46:42] many miners here so when I came here uh
[46:46] in in 2021 there was a lot of Home
[46:49] mining going on uh with A6 but also
[46:52] ethereum mining at that time still uh
[46:56] that whole mining I've seen
[46:58] disappear almost entirely um so mining
[47:03] on grid using the power from the grid
[47:06] has become uh uh yeah financially not uh
[47:10] not feasible
[47:11] anymore as there might be some miners
[47:14] using grid power but then they're
[47:16] stealing it uh the the cases for mining
[47:20] here in in Argentina is mostly on the on
[47:23] natural gas side um so there's a big oil
[47:27] on gas Fields here where there's uh um
[47:30] uh gas exploration going on that's being
[47:33] stranded so it's not being connected to
[47:36] pipelines um so they uh they start
[47:39] mining there or it's what they called
[47:42] Associated gas so gas that comes out
[47:45] while uh extracting oil um and uh
[47:49] instead of flaring or venting this gas
[47:52] it's being used to uh to mine Bitcoin uh
[47:55] and actually there's quite some strict
[47:57] regulations here about flaring uh so
[48:01] many uh oil producers cannot even
[48:04] extract um uh this oil if they don't off
[48:09] take or do something with that uh
[48:11] Associated gas so uh those are the the
[48:14] bigger use cases you see here um that
[48:18] industry is picking up so you see more
[48:20] and more minus building out but it's uh
[48:24] there's not huge um mining going on
[48:27] let's say like like we've seen in in
[48:30] Paraguay so uh most of these natural gas
[48:34] field sites or flare gas sites they're
[48:38] uh two to maybe 15 megawatts for a big S
[48:43] while in in Paraguay we've seen sites
[48:45] that are 50 to to even 100 megawatts so
[48:49] it's a different uh different type of uh
[48:52] mining environment here but I think it's
[48:55] a uh it's going to grow in the coming
[48:58] year right now the biggest challenge is
[49:00] uh still the importation tax so in the
[49:04] end you pay around 31% tax on your
[49:07] machines and that has a huge impact on
[49:09] the on the return of investment of your
[49:12] uh of your mining Hardware so um yeah as
[49:16] long as these importation taxes stay
[49:18] high there's no way around it uh then uh
[49:22] yeah mining will mostly be uh for for
[49:25] Argentina invest
[49:27] and less for foreign investors
[49:29] interesting um do how how do you uh find
[49:35] what are you looking at when you figure
[49:37] out where to to to M Bitcoin there's so
[49:40] many factors in that like the the price
[49:44] of the electricity probably one one of
[49:46] the big ones but also like
[49:47] infrastructure how can it keep up what
[49:49] are you looking at uh in in order to
[49:51] figure out where to mine Bitcoin or what
[49:53] did you see that other Miners did in the
[49:55] past yeah well I think uh a big starting
[49:58] point is uh is uh political stability
[50:01] and Regulatory uh regulatory stability
[50:04] so if you're not mining at all I I like
[50:08] in this start I was advised to to look
[50:11] into mining in in the US in the states
[50:15] um because it yeah regulation is quite
[50:17] clear and it's going to especially now
[50:19] with Trump Administration it it looks
[50:21] quite positive for miners if you're
[50:23] looking to uh to get access to lower or
[50:27] cheaper power for example in South
[50:29] America or Africa like Ethiopia has been
[50:32] booming uh you can do that but I always
[50:36] recommend to do that as a second step
[50:38] let's say to have a footprint in another
[50:41] in in another region uh and not
[50:43] necessarily to to start mining mining
[50:46] there um you see also in Ethiopia for
[50:49] example it's a lot of uh um Chinese and
[50:53] Russian investors that uh that deploy
[50:55] there and they they have uh yeah they
[50:58] have an interest in in in deploying
[51:00] their Capital abroad and are uh having
[51:04] different risk profile let's say than uh
[51:06] than most European or or American
[51:10] investors so um yeah it it it depends a
[51:14] lot where you want to start and how you
[51:15] want to start but I think that political
[51:18] stability reg regulatory stability is is
[51:21] a first step uh and then uh the type of
[51:25] power like many miners uh are looking
[51:29] for green energy right so if you're uh
[51:33] if you have this uh ESD or
[51:36] sustainability uh goal let's say then uh
[51:39] Hydro power uh is uh is very popular uh
[51:43] and in in Paraguay you see a lot of
[51:45] hydro production because of the big dams
[51:48] they have over there um if you then want
[51:50] to mine in in Argentina then it's it's
[51:53] probably more interesting to look at the
[51:55] flared gas
[51:57] uh mining because you uh you reduce
[52:00] emissions uh instead of going for the uh
[52:03] natural gas uh uh uh path let's say why
[52:08] are Bitcoin investors or Bitcoin mining
[52:10] investors looking for East G is is that
[52:13] like an actual is it an economical
[52:16] decision or like an branding decision
[52:19] it's a uh it's usually has to do with
[52:22] the type of investors they try to pull
[52:24] into their business so it's see it's
[52:27] it's mostly for financial reasons so uh
[52:30] uh yeah and then there's miners that
[52:33] want to uh yeah have have this image or
[52:36] promote that they're uh that they're
[52:39] doing good to the world and uh uh yeah
[52:42] mining has uh yeah has had a lot of
[52:46] critique on its environmental impact so
[52:49] by uh by tackling that issue right away
[52:53] like uh at the power source then uh it
[52:56] it help helps I think in in in getting
[52:58] uh clients or funding uh um yeah for
[53:02] your company makes total sense really
[53:04] cool uh one more question around the
[53:06] topic I have it's it seems like uh
[53:10] Bitcoin mining has a lot of the of
[53:13] similar attributes to normal data
[53:17] Computing Netflix servers AI data
[53:20] centers and stuff like that um are they
[53:23] kind of competing for the for the same
[53:26] and for the same places is that like
[53:29] because AI is a will probably grow a lot
[53:32] in in the coming future but Bitcoin also
[53:33] probably grows a lot the coming Futures
[53:37] uh or are you maybe already seeing maybe
[53:39] like big centers that have like half AI
[53:42] data Miners and half Bitcoin uh miners
[53:45] in them uh what are you seeing on that
[53:47] front yeah I think over this last year
[53:49] it already started in 2023 but uh many
[53:52] mostly bigger Bitcoin miners so publicly
[53:55] traded Bitcoin miners are uh exploring
[53:58] or uh already working in the AI high
[54:01] performance computer space uh it's very
[54:03] similar in the sense that it's both
[54:05] computing power uh that requires uh uh
[54:10] uh
[54:11] electricity um however the type of data
[54:13] centers are quite uh quite different so
[54:17] uh um whereby Bitcoin mining uh is a
[54:22] what we call flexible load uh this is a
[54:26] uh power the B miners use power in a
[54:29] flexible way so they can be switched off
[54:31] and on or powered up and down uh
[54:35] according to power available or or
[54:38] pricing on the uh on the network um uh
[54:43] AI hyper compute uh needs a high up time
[54:46] so they need to be running 99 point and
[54:50] you have even five NES behind the comma
[54:52] so
[54:53] 99.99999 and that uh that higher time
[54:56] which is not required by uh by Bitcoin
[54:59] miners has a has a big impact on the
[55:02] cost of the buildout so if you uh if you
[55:06] want to run AI high performance compute
[55:09] uh you need to have a a big redundancy
[55:11] in your build out so if the main power
[55:14] source uh drops then you need to have
[55:17] generators that uh that can turn on to
[55:20] keep your uh uh your uh uh gpus running
[55:25] um also um these build outs of AI
[55:29] hyperon compute if you look at the power
[55:32] consumption is less dense so you need
[55:34] more square
[55:35] meters um and uh also the the
[55:39] infrastructure is more expensive and the
[55:41] hardware so the gpus are currently a hot
[55:44] commodity while the ASC miners are still
[55:47] quite
[55:47] suppressed um the reason why miners are
[55:52] looking into providing services around
[55:54] AI high performance compute is that uh
[55:56] the premium for power is uh is is yeah
[55:59] way higher that these data centers can
[56:02] uh can make let's say if you compare to
[56:05] uh to bitcoin where price needs to be uh
[56:07] very low so uh um I think it's uh
[56:11] there's a lot of
[56:13] overlap uh both Industries can learn
[56:15] from each other you can integrate both
[56:18] uh types of computes but it's not for
[56:21] everybody because it's it's really
[56:22] Capital intensive uh so you need to yeah
[56:25] you need have a serious uh um a serious
[56:30] company let's say to to engage and it
[56:32] also doesn't make sense to just deploy
[56:35] half a megawatt of AI hyperon Compu it
[56:37] needs it needs to be a bigger data
[56:39] center in order for it to be uh yeah
[56:42] financially feasible let's say super
[56:45] interesting uh the the intersection
[56:48] there um how do you look at um let's say
[56:52] normal people coming into Bitcoin mining
[56:56] with not like hundreds of thousands of
[56:58] dollars to deploy but like maybe a few
[57:00] hundreds maybe a few thousand dollars to
[57:02] deploy um what would you say is there
[57:05] good is it even is it a good idea to
[57:09] have I don't know two S9 running at home
[57:12] or is it then better to uh host it
[57:15] somewhere or how do you look at that
[57:17] topic whether one is better than the
[57:19] other it's uh I don't think it's very
[57:23] comparable let's say because s9s they're
[57:25] very cheap if you home mine you're
[57:27] probably not making a lot of uh profits
[57:29] especially with these S9 so I think most
[57:33] H home home miners do it uh as a hobby
[57:37] so they want to learn how these machines
[57:39] work they want to reuse the heat uh they
[57:43] enjoy that process uh you see also a lot
[57:46] of bitex miners right these mini miners
[57:49] uh popping up I think it's the both bitx
[57:52] and and reuse of heat in your house is
[57:55] is more of a a hobby and educational uh
[57:58] tool than anything uh it won't make you
[58:01] rich let's say um if you are looking to
[58:05] deploy uh uh more Capital uh then
[58:09] there's different options for retail
[58:11] investors you can uh you can use what
[58:14] what we call a buy and host uh
[58:16] opportunity so you you uh purchase
[58:19] machines at the hosting service and they
[58:22] deploy those machines in the rxs and
[58:24] they run them for you um
[58:26] um this is also a good way to to to
[58:30] start mining this that's this is how I
[58:32] started as well um the only thing is
[58:35] that uh when you buy these machines you
[58:37] need to understand that sometimes the
[58:39] power goes down or your machine breaks
[58:41] down so um it it requires some uh
[58:46] involvement as well so it's it's less
[58:48] passive let's say than just buying a
[58:49] buying Bitcoin but less active than
[58:53] running these machines at home um but
[58:55] there's other tools out there you have
[58:58] uh uh for example hes power or hes rate
[59:02] marketplaces like nice has where you can
[59:05] buy H rate as you wish uh you have these
[59:08] Cloud mining Services uh where you can
[59:11] buy shorter term contracts uh there's
[59:14] different ways to get exposure let's say
[59:16] uh to uh to H rate without uh without
[59:19] directly owning the hardware because uh
[59:22] yeah owning the hardware comes with
[59:24] maintenance with repairs uh uh and and
[59:27] yeah more active involvement let's say
[59:29] interesting it's a it's it's a good
[59:32] model to to let it run by by someone
[59:35] else
[59:37] uh because you unless you want to start
[59:41] an an mining operational mining Farm
[59:43] then you should do it yourself obviously
[59:46] but outside that make a lot of noise and
[59:48] if you don't want the noise you need to
[59:49] have them imerge in oil or have a
[59:52] hydrocool setup which is more technical
[59:55] uh uh so yeah like I uh I'm not very
[60:00] techsavvy I have a economics background
[60:03] and business background that's my folks
[60:05] also in the industry but so I wouldn't
[60:07] be able to to uh run these machines at
[60:10] home or maybe I will be able but uh uh
[60:13] it uh it will get me frustrated because
[60:16] I find installing a modem already
[60:18] frustrating so uh I think uh if you do
[60:21] it at home like it's uh it's really
[60:23] because you like it and you want to
[60:25] learn about it uh and um I think the the
[60:28] bitex movement is is really great uh
[60:31] because it's a a counter movement to
[60:33] this big Mega mines and uh uh people
[60:36] that have this uh EOS of
[60:39] decentralization very uh high up there
[60:42] uh but it's also a great tool because it
[60:45] educates people about Mining and what we
[60:47] need in mining is uh in the industry is
[60:50] is people you know like uh uh the the
[60:54] industry is growing very fast so we need
[60:56] people from other
[60:57] Industries different backgrounds that
[60:59] that that join uh the industry in order
[61:01] to yeah professionalize and mature
[61:04] further let's say do you think that
[61:05] Bitcoin mining will be integrated in in
[61:09] like heating products that there's 21
[61:11] energy already like already companies
[61:13] doing that but is is that a future to
[61:15] where you see um even small Bitcoin
[61:18] miners just deployed in small um devices
[61:23] around the house that you just plug and
[61:26] you use it as as it it is used to used
[61:28] usually without Bitcoin minus but in the
[61:30] background there is like you just
[61:32] connect the wallet and you get some
[61:33] satous for it yeah that could very well
[61:36] be uh I uh I did a keynote presentation
[61:39] at Bitcoin Amsterdam and there I finish
[61:42] the presentation with the minor of the
[61:44] future and I think the minor of the
[61:46] future because of these revenues that
[61:48] are going down forever like uh uh the
[61:51] minor of the future are um not
[61:54] necessarily um miners at their core
[61:57] right so it can be a a utility that uses
[62:00] uh Bitcoin miners to balance the grid it
[62:02] can be uh a greenhouse that reuses the
[62:05] heat to uh heat the heat the greenhouse
[62:09] or uh we've seen that with District
[62:11] heating as well it can be a a factory
[62:14] that has a big Power contract uh but
[62:17] they don't use all that power 247 at the
[62:20] same uh same pace so when uh the power
[62:24] usage of their production line goes down
[62:26] they can switch the minus on in order to
[62:29] uh to lower these the the the cost of uh
[62:32] of their power there's different uh ways
[62:35] you can think of um landfills that
[62:38] produce methane uh that cannot be really
[62:41] commercialized uh to to use that methane
[62:44] to uh to uh generate energy and and
[62:47] start mining uh I think the the minor of
[62:50] the future will be integrated with uh
[62:53] with other types of businesses and uh
[62:56] um yeah might not even be U minor at the
[63:00] core but it might be an A Tool uh in the
[63:03] energy management uh tool belt of uh of
[63:06] certain companies very true really cool
[63:09] thank you so much um we have one
[63:11] question that I asked each and every one
[63:13] of my guest and is and it is the
[63:15] question of what can we learn from you
[63:17] besides Bitcoin oh besides Bitcoin it's
[63:20] been quite a focus on bitcoin especially
[63:23] mining um
[63:25] can you learn from me
[63:27] yeah uh I don't know I uh I think uh
[63:32] I that's a tough question I think uh
[63:35] what I've learned living here in
[63:37] Argentina far away you know from my
[63:39] family friends like uh uh appreciating
[63:43] uh your friendships and your family the
[63:46] time you spent with your family so
[63:48] underestimated it so I think that's uh
[63:51] maybe uh a lesson I uh uh I knew already
[63:57] but I've I've I it's a a daily reality
[64:00] for me right being far away from my
[64:02] family and friends so having the time to
[64:06] spend with them uh is very important I
[64:08] think that might be a very Christmas me
[64:11] Christmasy message uh and then uh yeah
[64:16] like I I uh I find um Sports very
[64:20] important like I do a lot of
[64:22] sports uh and I think that's that's
[64:25] helps me at least to mentally uh get
[64:29] clearance on a lot of stuff so taking a
[64:32] break from uh from Bitcoin taking a
[64:35] break from work taking a break from
[64:36] everything by by doing sports is so so
[64:39] important not only physically but uh
[64:42] mentally uh makes you much stronger I
[64:44] think very true yeah you you um you need
[64:48] Sports for the mental capacity
[64:50] physically of course Al but I I honestly
[64:52] do it for my main motivation for doing
[64:55] sports is uh for the mental Clarity and
[64:57] for the balance for for my mind uh break
[65:01] mentally right yeah do do doing it for
[65:04] the physical part yes it's great also
[65:06] but the mental part is my my main
[65:08] motivation perfect very cool Nico we
[65:10] have end rtin the podcast where the
[65:12] previous guest is asking a question for
[65:13] the next guest without knowing who the
[65:15] next guest actually is and the question
[65:17] for you is do you think the goal of
[65:20] Bitcoin is to create the perfect money
[65:23] or just the best money uh I think the
[65:26] goal was to create the perfect money
[65:29] right yeah I would say the perfect uh uh
[65:33] yeah absolutely I think uh Bitcoin is
[65:35] already the perfect money but we still
[65:37] have a lot to uh a lot to figure out
[65:40] along the way but yeah uh really cool
[65:42] thank you so much Nico for for being on
[65:43] the show before I let you go back can
[65:45] people find you ask your
[65:47] questions uh yeah so I'm quite active on
[65:49] social media Twitter and LinkedIn
