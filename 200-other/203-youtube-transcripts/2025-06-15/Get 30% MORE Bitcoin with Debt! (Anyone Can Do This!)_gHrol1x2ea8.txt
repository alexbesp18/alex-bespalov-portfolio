[00:00] Bitcoin is kind of a 30% risk-free
[00:02] annual returns why don't you get a
[00:04] mortgage why don't you get a loan you
[00:06] should take advantage of the system that
[00:08] is killing you the faster you buy
[00:09] Bitcoin the more you can buy for your
[00:11] own field I stole money from you I stole
[00:13] money from everyone in European Union I
[00:15] stole money from everyone that has a
[00:18] Fiat exposure the more Bitcoin you have
[00:20] the more freedom I have they want to
[00:22] keep it at this 2% inflation only so you
[00:24] do not notice that but they're so greedy
[00:26] so they do it for a 10% they 13% and in
[00:29] some third world countries they do it
[00:30] just for double digit and people notice
[00:32] it once people notice it everything
[00:34] starts to crumble once we fix the money
[00:36] we fix the world we fix half of the
[00:38] problem in the world with just a Bitcoin
[00:39] I don't care at the end of the day if it
[00:41] is a trump if it is a Biden if it's a
[00:43] CALA Harris just get out of the jail the
[00:45] Fiat system is the main jail and the
[00:47] problem with this jail is that we'll all
[00:49] born in
[00:50] [Music]
[00:54] it I would like to focus maybe a little
[00:57] bit uh on the loan I took for buying
[01:01] Bitcoin I think this is It's of course
[01:03] not a financial advice I want to
[01:05] underscore that because I guess
[01:07] everyone's situation is different but I
[01:10] think it's an interesting one uh if you
[01:12] should do it and maybe who should do it
[01:15] why I should do it and maybe like what
[01:17] pushed me to do it uh
[01:20] eventually so this is a one thing and in
[01:23] general going from this to like the
[01:25] money printer like so you can do it and
[01:29] you abuse kind of the system that is
[01:31] abusing you right by doing it and uh I
[01:34] also wanted to underscore that I never
[01:37] wanted to take a loan I had some
[01:39] problems with with depth in my past and
[01:42] maybe I will tell a little bit about it
[01:44] too uh so I was kind of uh very very
[01:49] hesitant to do it but uh eventually I
[01:52] pulled the trigger and uh maybe we can
[01:56] discuss about it what pushed me to do it
[01:59] to because it was it wasn't irrelevant
[02:02] loan but uh eventually I did it I bought
[02:05] a Bitcoin with it just straight I just
[02:07] got a money just took everything out
[02:10] from the bank bought some CP bought some
[02:13] sorry not crypto bought the Bitcoin with
[02:14] it and yeah and I think I think it was
[02:18] probably life-changing decision uh at
[02:21] the end of the day for me wow I think we
[02:24] can directly jump into that um
[02:28] I'm let's start in the begin
[02:30] what was the bad decision what was the
[02:32] bad thing with dep that you had before
[02:34] that yeah so I guess it's I was when I
[02:38] was thinking about when the when was the
[02:40] first time I've heard about Bitcoin it
[02:41] was like 2016 and uh it was my um best I
[02:47] had a best time of my life right uh I
[02:49] was uh I was spending my mother's money
[02:53] on whatever I wanted right I was taking
[02:56] all the short-term loans with a high
[02:58] percent like with a high High rates you
[03:01] know and I was spending it on the you
[03:04] know the all the hedonistic stuff that
[03:06] you can buy in your life uh of spending
[03:09] it on alcohol of spending on other
[03:11] parties it's shame uh it's a shame that
[03:13] I did it you know and when I wonder why
[03:15] I haven't bought Bitcoin it's uh
[03:18] probably um you know it's probably
[03:21] because I wasn't in a state of despair
[03:24] at that time right there's something
[03:25] like sailor said once that uh you cannot
[03:28] really sell a Bitcoin to someone that is
[03:30] not in a despair or it's very very hard
[03:33] to do it if someone is you know within
[03:35] the system Riding High the waves in a
[03:38] Fiat system he's not very interested in
[03:40] Bitcoin right like it's very hard to
[03:42] sell someone a Bitcoin that's you know
[03:45] doing really really great even though I
[03:47] wasn't doing great at that time that the
[03:49] spare com raater of course the hangover
[03:52] after all of this came later so the
[03:56] short-term loans were yeah it was very
[03:59] stupid I did a lot of stupid things in
[04:01] my life and it was probably one of them
[04:05] and uh yeah I've learned it the hard way
[04:07] how to H how is it to be to live in a
[04:11] Dept right how to how to be you know
[04:14] people knocking on your doors asking for
[04:15] the money for you to
[04:17] pay and uh that's why eventually when I
[04:22] uh when I paid all that Dept that what
[04:25] that's why it was so hard for me to take
[04:27] a decision to take another loan this
[04:30] time it wasn't a short-term loan of
[04:31] course uh it was just a loan that I took
[04:33] in a bank just the right way how you
[04:35] should do it
[04:37] probably
[04:39] uh yeah
[04:42] um that that's that's that's uh that's
[04:45] pretty much it I don't know I got lost a
[04:47] little bit in the story but it's
[04:49] interesting because uh the the first
[04:53] experience you had with with de was
[04:55] basically the the bad side of De where
[04:59] Dept is enslaving people but now you try
[05:03] to do the good side of dep where you can
[05:06] use dep to enrich yourself and kind of
[05:09] use that system uh in in a good way
[05:13] which a lot of people are doing um even
[05:16] I to a certain extent do it because I
[05:18] usually dance around uh my zero uh bank
[05:22] balance and sometimes I'm going likeus
[05:24] 2,000 - 5,000 and I try to get again to
[05:27] zero if I'm going above like 2,000 5,000
[05:31] in in the plus I usually directly buy
[05:34] Bitcoin with that so I always make that
[05:36] dance of having zero Fe fear yeah but I
[05:41] still use uh sometimes in some days the
[05:44] the dep system to basically have maximum
[05:48] exposure to bitcoin um now what is the
[05:51] good side of the depth and what are you
[05:53] trying to do uh I I loved how you how
[05:56] you wrote me I'm I'm trying to how how
[06:00] did you write I'm stealing from you
[06:02] basically Ste from everyone that is
[06:04] holding
[06:05] fear so this is the thing that I I stole
[06:10] money from you right I stole money from
[06:12] you you can put it in the Highlight I
[06:15] stole money from everyone probably in
[06:17] European Union I stole money from
[06:20] everyone that uh has a Fiat exposure in
[06:24] Poland in pln and you know it feels good
[06:29] right it feels really good uh and on the
[06:33] other hand it feels absolutely bad right
[06:37] it feels like you did immoral thing
[06:39] because eventually you you can think
[06:41] about it like you know like stealing
[06:43] there is a reason why we why we have all
[06:46] this you you shouldn't steal laws right
[06:48] or even in the decalog there is being
[06:50] said that hey don't steal from me right
[06:53] like there is a reason it's like the
[06:56] foundation of our whole civilization to
[06:59] just let's agree that we do not steal
[07:01] from each other you know because maybe
[07:02] it's a beneficial in the long run right
[07:04] if people do not steal with each other
[07:05] if people do not murder each other if
[07:08] people you know sleep with their own
[07:09] wives this is what is in the decalog
[07:11] right which is kind of a like the
[07:14] foundation of uh Western Civilization we
[07:18] can we we can say that I guess the the
[07:20] the Christianity right and the decalogue
[07:22] that a lot of the laws is builded on top
[07:25] of that right nowadays right so it felt
[07:29] really good but on the other hand it
[07:30] felt really bad because what I did right
[07:34] is in fact taking this loan uh Bank
[07:38] produced it out of thinner and uh
[07:41] basically I deluded the money supply I
[07:44] increased the money supply in Poland
[07:46] right because first I got a pln then I
[07:48] have to go to the euro then I have to go
[07:51] to the Xchange then I have to go to the
[07:52] Bitcoin then I have to go to the cold
[07:54] storage right and this is the whole the
[07:55] end of the story but eventually I had to
[07:59] increase the supply of pln in Poland
[08:01] right and basically I
[08:03] stole just a tiny little bit of course
[08:06] it's unnoticeable right but I stole
[08:09] effectively from all of the people that
[08:12] are uh living in Poland right so it is
[08:15] unnoticeable you know but it is it is a
[08:18] fact it is a fact because like you can
[08:21] you can think about it like if you take
[08:23] a bucket of water I don't know where's
[08:25] the majority of your listeners are
[08:27] coming from America Europe it's from
[08:30] America so I'll may maybe maybe I'll use
[08:32] it the American one so if you take a
[08:34] buck bucket of water from the Mexican
[08:36] Gulf or now it's probably going to
[08:39] called American Gulf right like uh if
[08:41] you take a bucket of water from the
[08:42] American Gulf right is the level of the
[08:45] sea in New York is going to decrease or
[08:49] not right just a bucket of water I just
[08:51] take it out from the ocean is it going
[08:53] to decrease right so I asked CH GPT
[08:56] about it and he said like no it's not
[08:58] it's unnoticeable it's a noticeable
[09:01] nobody's going to notice that
[09:03] right but effectively you did you
[09:08] decreased the level of the ocean in New
[09:11] York you know the harbor is a little bit
[09:14] more shallower I don't know by how much
[09:16] it's like probably nanometers
[09:20] right but the matter of the fact is that
[09:23] I did it right I made made the the the
[09:27] the New York uh uh Harbor just it has
[09:31] just a little bit shallower water and
[09:33] what I did to the financial system I of
[09:35] course uh by decreasing the amount of
[09:38] money I've created inflation right so
[09:41] tomorrow somebody's going to buy some
[09:43] eggs a little bit bit more expensive
[09:47] right and then you know it's a matter of
[09:49] scale because I probably I'm not the
[09:51] only one that did it that day so if you
[09:54] multiply it you know by a thousand so
[09:57] like those buckets you multiply it by
[09:59] thousand by a million then it starts to
[10:02] make then it's visible right and this is
[10:04] what the central Bankers are doing
[10:06] they're over greedy they want to keep it
[10:09] at this 2% inflation only so you do not
[10:12] notice that but they're so greedy they
[10:14] just
[10:15] cannot they just hand help hand help
[10:18] themselves right so they do it for a 10%
[10:20] they 133% and in some third world
[10:23] countries they do it just for double
[10:25] digit and people notice it right and
[10:27] once people notice it you know they are
[10:30] uh everything starts to
[10:32] crumble uh and it's getting even worse
[10:35] right yeah so yeah sorry to jump in here
[10:38] I think it's really interesting um there
[10:40] are so many amazing comparisons with
[10:43] inflation and and the depth system I
[10:45] love Jeff bof is one with left the house
[10:47] if like if I go to do you in the house
[10:49] and just take one small item and I do
[10:51] this every year it's some point your
[10:53] house will be completely empty and I
[10:56] think um people don't realize that
[11:00] because it's just such a huge and
[11:01] complex system but if you break it down
[11:04] to a small one if you just take uh for
[11:07] example the fridge uh you're going to
[11:09] someone's fridge and always taking a
[11:11] small sip of milk and you take a small
[11:14] uh piece of the bread the first time
[11:17] probably nobody noticed because they're
[11:19] like H maybe I drank that milk someday I
[11:21] don't know how much milk there was in
[11:23] the carton really um but if you do that
[11:26] a lot and you drink a lot uh at some
[11:28] point you're like like where is my my
[11:31] food going uh and this is the same thing
[11:34] with inflation that's why they have this
[11:36] target of like 2% inflation because
[11:38] that's a Target that most people never
[11:40] notice but if it goes to 10% in states
[11:43] there are consistently more people
[11:45] notice definitely people notice at 100%
[11:48] 200% if we go to hyperinflation
[11:50] scenarios and this is the problem also
[11:53] in your example with the bucket if
[11:55] you're the only one getting one small
[11:58] bucket out of the ocean nobody know this
[12:00] but if for some reason the ocean has
[12:03] small leaks and they are going somewhere
[12:06] I'm not I'm not so good in geology but
[12:09] if if the ocean has small leaks and
[12:12] those Leaks get bigger and bigger and
[12:13] bigger and all of the sudden the the
[12:15] water sinking and sinking and sinking at
[12:17] some point we we have to live down there
[12:20] in the ocean uh to be closer to the
[12:22] ocean because at some point there will
[12:24] not be water left because all those
[12:26] movements are exponential it's the same
[12:29] thing if you have I don't know if you
[12:30] have a uh yeah if you do a bath top uh
[12:35] and you have water in there uh I don't
[12:37] know I have a thing where I have two
[12:40] settings where I can leave it out very
[12:42] uh uh slow and one where it's basically
[12:45] empty very quick and there's even like a
[12:47] small circle building then uh and this
[12:50] makes a huge difference how fast it's
[12:54] deflationary and it's now an interesting
[12:56] question of like okay if you take a loan
[12:59] out this is essentially expanding the
[13:01] money supply this is essentially
[13:03] inflation this is essentially stealing
[13:06] if you if you live through as a good
[13:09] person you don't want to steal is that
[13:11] stealing like I I think that there is
[13:15] stealing but a very small amount like
[13:18] it's it's almost like taking the uh the
[13:20] pen from the bank uh maybe the Benner
[13:23] from the bank is even more than that uh
[13:26] but it is definitely stealing and it's
[13:27] something bad the question is should we
[13:30] use as good
[13:32] people um the the bad system and maybe
[13:37] bring it quicker to fall with that
[13:40] because we quicker and taking more money
[13:42] from that system and putting into
[13:43] Bitcoin is that maybe a good thing to do
[13:47] I don't know that's that's an
[13:48] interesting ethical debate I feel like
[13:51] yeah like um you you've made a lot of
[13:54] good points uh and what I wanted to say
[13:58] like
[13:59] this is the whole problem of the system
[14:01] you know that it pushes you to do it
[14:03] that pushes you to do the immoral thing
[14:05] right that's what I hate the most about
[14:08] the system right that you know I guess
[14:10] the bitcoiners do not mind that I stole
[14:13] a little bit from the other guys and I
[14:15] bought some Bitcoin with it right like
[14:17] they don't hold the grudge they would
[14:19] probably even applaud me right but uh
[14:23] what are what what's what's with the
[14:24] rest of the people you know like like
[14:28] it's not really good to do so then
[14:31] should
[14:32] we so there are like two ways right
[14:34] should we kill the system slowly because
[14:36] I think I think you
[14:38] know sometimes when I think about
[14:40] Bitcoin I think that there is no bad
[14:43] scenarios for Bitcoin there are only
[14:44] good scenarios for Bitcoin right because
[14:47] there are only bad scenarios for the
[14:48] central B Central Bankers there's only
[14:51] good scenarios for Bitcoin so I don't
[14:53] see any bad scenarios out there uh even
[14:56] though there are some challenges so um
[14:59] should we go the fast way should we go
[15:01] the slow way um so the fast way might
[15:05] end up very very badly I was thinking
[15:06] about it multiple times you know like
[15:09] these people in power they the problem
[15:12] with them is that they're so hopelessly
[15:14] dependent on the system that I think I
[15:18] think they cannot stand it the they
[15:21] still have so much power that if you
[15:23] will take it from them very very quickly
[15:26] they might react very very Dangerously
[15:29] very very nervously very very
[15:31] aggressively you know maybe it's um like
[15:36] I know it's maybe controversial uh but
[15:39] uh actually the um Robin Williams made
[15:43] this comparison about central banks is
[15:45] that there a group of of junkes that are
[15:47] on heroin right like I feel that this is
[15:50] even more than that if you ever studied
[15:52] how people uh are getting addicted on
[15:55] opiates on heroin and what are the
[15:57] symptoms of withdrawal
[16:01] you would understand what I mean but
[16:02] saying you know like it's like taking
[16:05] you know the needle from from a heroin
[16:08] addict but I think it's multiple time
[16:10] worse you know if if you ever saw a
[16:13] person on a withdrawal they would do
[16:16] some of them would do anything to get it
[16:18] back right they would steal they would
[16:20] Rob they would kill maybe some of them
[16:23] would kill right so imagine now you got
[16:25] a bunch of people in a power that are
[16:28] addicted to it so much they cannot
[16:31] cannot give it away they cannot go cold
[16:33] turkey I guess most of them cannot go
[16:34] cold turkey on this one so if we'll take
[16:37] it from them fast I guess it might end
[16:39] up in I hope so I hope not in some World
[16:43] War third world war or something like
[16:45] this but it it is a scenario that uh
[16:48] might
[16:49] happen I don't know how I don't know
[16:51] when but you know it is very powerful
[16:55] combination you know you got an addict
[16:57] that have a lot of power
[16:59] you want to take it from
[17:01] them expect you know a storm you know
[17:06] that's an interesting point that I never
[17:07] thought about because they they are
[17:09] addicts and they kind of have and there
[17:13] are a lot of extremely interesting
[17:15] studies with rats about addictions uh
[17:18] you probably know that uh there are
[17:20] Studies have done with rats if you give
[17:23] them a button that can press and they
[17:24] have some dopamine release they will
[17:26] press till they die and they will stop
[17:28] eating all those things but they also
[17:30] tested something really interesting once
[17:32] they stop putting the function behind
[17:35] the button they will uh uh continue to
[17:39] press it up to to a point where they get
[17:41] oh there's nothing happening with the
[17:43] press button so they stop pressing that
[17:45] button but then if you introduce
[17:48] something really catastrophic uh to
[17:50] their life they again even though they
[17:53] know the button is not working they
[17:55] again go to that button and try to push
[17:58] it as hard as possible so that's then
[18:01] compared to the monetary system now
[18:03] where they're pushing now the button
[18:06] slowly slowly slowly and more uh and if
[18:10] now something really bad happens they
[18:12] probably will push the Buton just harder
[18:14] and harder to the point where the button
[18:17] might not work anymore which is then
[18:19] hyperinflation where everything comes
[18:21] out of control what are they doing now
[18:23] because they still have all the weapons
[18:25] they still have all the military power
[18:27] that that's kind of the what you just
[18:29] brought up the the dangerous uh scenario
[18:32] this dangerous situation what are you
[18:34] making of that what do do you think
[18:36] Bitcoin is a a peaceful Revolution or
[18:38] could be a peaceful Revolution yeah well
[18:41] I think Bitcoin is just putting those
[18:43] people on a rehab right
[18:46] like it's just like we're going up to
[18:48] them and telling them we Bitcoin is the
[18:51] intervention you come to your addicted
[18:53] friend right just saying like hey you
[18:55] had a fun you know but you got to get
[18:58] your [ __ ] together now and we're just
[19:00] putting you on a on a rehab I don't know
[19:03] for how long until you just get sober
[19:06] you know because they're not sober
[19:08] they're not thinking clearly I was
[19:10] thinking about it you know multiple
[19:11] times now like like why they do it you
[19:13] know like because it doesn't make like I
[19:15] know okay I know you want so much power
[19:18] you want so much you like the money you
[19:21] like the stuff but don't you think where
[19:23] it is leading right like don't you don't
[19:25] you
[19:27] see where it is heading right like it's
[19:30] it's quite obvious right where it'sing
[19:31] heading right like shouldn't you have
[19:34] some a little bit tiny amount of Reason
[19:37] talking to you in a in the back of your
[19:39] head saying like hey you're you're
[19:42] you're you're gonna crash against the
[19:43] wall if you're gonna continue to do that
[19:45] right like uh but I feel like it is it
[19:49] has come to this to this to this
[19:50] scenario where they just can't help
[19:52] thems and somebody even said that I
[19:55] can't recall the name but like even if
[19:57] they would like to change it
[19:59] right if then if they would like to
[20:01] change it it's going to cause
[20:04] catastrophical like financial crisis
[20:07] events right if they're going to tell
[20:09] like okay we're going to go in cold
[20:10] turkey we're not doing QA anymore uh
[20:13] we're not pumping the Fiat into the
[20:15] system right it's going to cause some
[20:18] catastrophic events their Banker friends
[20:20] going to fall once the banker friends
[20:22] going to fall the society is going to
[20:23] fall and once the society is going to
[20:26] fall you know they knock on their doors
[20:30] and then say like hey what are you guys
[20:31] doing and they're going to vote them out
[20:33] like the people also are most of the
[20:37] people are so dependent also on the
[20:38] system right that when the crisis is
[20:40] going to come to them they're going to
[20:42] ask the government to do something about
[20:44] it right and what the government can do
[20:47] about it what what they can do about it
[20:49] they can do the QE again right so even
[20:53] if you want to change it eventually you
[20:55] cannot change it because if you want to
[20:58] try if you want to be opportunistic you
[21:00] want to see like okay stop let's guys
[21:01] let's sober up right you're going to be
[21:04] voted out of the office and the guy that
[21:07] comes after you is going to do the QE
[21:09] right so there is I feel like there's no
[21:13] way for or about like changing the
[21:17] system from the top or it's very very
[21:20] very very hard to do it like so the
[21:23] point is that we have to get things in
[21:25] our own hand right all the bitcoiners
[21:28] have to take things in our own hand
[21:30] right it all started in the mailing list
[21:32] and it's still like grassroot initiative
[21:35] right Bitcoin is like the change has to
[21:37] come from us not not from them they're
[21:41] so corrupt they just cannot do it right
[21:44] just canot do it so we have to
[21:46] peacefully put them into the rehab and
[21:49] it is what we have to do right and one
[21:52] of my points I wanted to make today also
[21:54] is like don't count on your politician
[21:57] on your favorite politician doesn't
[21:59] matter if he's from right or from left
[22:01] if he's from Pro abortion he's not pro
[22:04] abortion is he's for human rights Women
[22:08] rights lgbtq rights like it doesn't
[22:12] really matter you know it doesn't really
[22:14] matter just focus on a Bitcoin right
[22:17] just just focus to fix the money and I
[22:20] think once we fix the money we fix the
[22:22] world we fix half of the problem in the
[22:23] world with just the Bitcoin right that's
[22:26] why we should have our laser eyes on
[22:28] it's it's the first it's the elephant in
[22:30] the room let's just address it let's
[22:31] just forget about it it's one Banner we
[22:35] can unite around right just focus on
[22:39] this uh put all these uh all these
[22:42] junkies into the rehab and then we will
[22:45] figure out uh what is the best for us if
[22:47] we need abortion more abortion if we
[22:49] need Pro more pro-choice more pro- life
[22:51] if we need more capitalistic
[22:53] socialistic it doesn't matter I I like
[22:56] to put it that way that you know
[22:59] like if you're in a jail you know it
[23:02] doesn't matter who's the who's the mayor
[23:03] of the jail for you it doesn't matter uh
[23:07] what's the currency in the jail for you
[23:09] uh if it is a cigarettes or you know or
[23:12] or some drugs uh it doesn't matter
[23:15] what's the health care uh in the in the
[23:17] prison that much you know it doesn't
[23:19] matter that much you know maybe from
[23:22] time to time you're going to get a good
[23:23] mayor in the prison like Trump right
[23:25] like but he's still a mayor of the
[23:27] prison you're living in
[23:29] so I don't care at the end of the day
[23:32] that much if it is a trump if it is a
[23:34] Biden if it's Kamala Harris it is
[23:35] whoever your favorite politician in your
[23:37] own country just get out of the jail
[23:41] right like like let's get out of the
[23:43] jail how about getting out of the jail
[23:46] and then we'll think about what we do
[23:47] next right and not get comfortable
[23:50] because some people like to get
[23:51] comfortable in jail right okay we're in
[23:53] a jail okay let's let's make our life
[23:56] more comfortable let's let's make a
[23:58] capitalism in our jail right so we can
[24:00] make this Commerce you know we can we
[24:03] can sell stuff in a jail let's get out
[24:05] of the jail for God's
[24:08] sake that's is um is is the jail the
[24:12] feat system or does it extend to the
[24:14] political system I think this is the
[24:16] Fiat system I think this is the Fiat
[24:19] system is the main jail and the problem
[24:21] with this jail is that we'll all born in
[24:24] it my wife is attorney you know and from
[24:28] to time she's got these cases right like
[24:30] there was a guy that was sitting in a
[24:31] prison for 15 years and then he went out
[24:34] and he stopped someone like within the
[24:36] five days after he got released and then
[24:39] went back to the jail I'm like dude like
[24:43] don't you want to live outside of the
[24:45] jail like like you just got your freedom
[24:49] right AR weren't you waiting for or
[24:51] something like no you know because jail
[24:56] is now his life right the problem also
[24:58] with the society the problem we're
[24:59] facing as bitcoiners is that people
[25:02] don't understand what's the freedom
[25:03] anymore because they were born in jail
[25:05] they think oh so this is what I got
[25:09] right we we live in this bubble where we
[25:12] think this is normal we live in a Fiat
[25:14] system we think this is normal right so
[25:17] what do you mean by getting out I've
[25:19] been born in here I've been imagine I I
[25:22] know I don't know if there are any
[25:23] studies but imagine someone being born
[25:26] in jail Not only living there for 15
[25:28] years but imagine from the very moment
[25:30] you you've been
[25:32] born the only thing you know is jail
[25:37] right and now go to that guy and
[25:40] convince him that there is you know
[25:42] there is a freedom out there you can go
[25:44] out wherever you want you know there's
[25:46] no one watching you
[25:49] 247 it's guy like n this is some scam I
[25:53] don't I don't buy it right like I don't
[25:54] buy it it cannot be like this right so
[25:57] the Fiat is the biggest problem I
[26:00] think uh and we gotta get out of it as
[26:03] soon as possible okay maybe they're not
[26:06] that as soon as possible let's let's
[26:08] talk about like we can discuss about it
[26:10] if we want to get out as soon as
[26:11] possible or or or a sailor is saying
[26:15] let's just don't burn everything and
[26:17] just get on a live boat in Bitcoin right
[26:20] because a lot of things might happen
[26:21] that we do not expect and
[26:24] uh maybe just go the slow way maybe try
[26:27] to convince them
[26:29] or but um I don't care which way we
[26:34] choose uh what we have to do uh is is we
[26:37] just have to stack SS and this is what
[26:39] all I know right stack SS maybe educate
[26:43] people maybe educate to try try to do it
[26:46] right along the way it it's almost like
[26:48] Freedom can be scary for for people
[26:51] Freedom can be uh frightening and it's
[26:54] it it seems to be good to be true and
[26:57] then if you're actually like oh like it
[26:59] could be actually true then it's like oh
[27:00] I don't want that because it's scary uh
[27:03] oh I don't want to have my own seat phas
[27:05] because what if I lose it what if uh
[27:08] what what if something happens to it
[27:10] something like like all those questions
[27:12] come in your head and it's it can be
[27:14] scary it's it's it's a it's a new kind
[27:17] of future and uh I think we have to be
[27:20] um careful with going too quick in there
[27:24] and and and you mention it it might be
[27:27] like if if the tianic sying we we should
[27:30] we we should argue for a very slow
[27:32] syncing of the Titanic so we can have
[27:35] enough time to get everyone on on on the
[27:37] savings boat but at the same time every
[27:40] day this fear chil goes on it makes
[27:43] things even worse and worse and worse so
[27:45] it's it's hard to say it's it's good
[27:47] that nobody's in control of how fast
[27:49] this Orange Building goes because it
[27:51] would be a hard debate it it it isn't
[27:53] anyways an organic uh movement that goes
[27:57] forward if if you like or don't like and
[28:00] then it comes just down to educating
[28:02] your loved ones and get as many people
[28:04] as possible as soon as possible uh do
[28:07] the do the good side and that that's
[28:09] kind of that that's kind of where I at
[28:11] with like oh let's let's let's scream it
[28:14] out in the ocean uh let's uh tell people
[28:17] uh about it and and let's work towards
[28:19] it and hopefully we get to it but once
[28:22] um we we we kind of got distracted of of
[28:25] the first thing we wanted to talk about
[28:27] uh of how you did your loan and and what
[28:30] what what was your strategy around that
[28:32] um only took us half an hour to get here
[28:36] uh yeah sorry I'm I'm guilty of that I'm
[28:40] guilty of that I sometimes diverge from
[28:42] the main course of the discussion while
[28:44] my faults are going somewhere but you
[28:45] know when I get the flow and I chased
[28:47] the then then then it's hard to help
[28:49] myself so feel free to just interrupt me
[28:52] like hey Carol We were supposed to talk
[28:54] about the loan no no no it's those
[28:59] ramblings are the best part of the
[29:01] podcast usually so I I I love that uh
[29:05] but what are you doing now with uh using
[29:08] the bad system to get quick into the in
[29:11] the good system and get better into the
[29:12] good system uh and how do you do that
[29:15] with with the loan and and what's your
[29:16] strategy and your reasoning behind that
[29:19] so you know it it's it all started like
[29:22] I actually am not that long I'm not I
[29:24] don't not have that much experience as a
[29:26] Bitcoin Maxi I think it's more more like
[29:29] I would say four months five months I'm
[29:31] pretty fresh fresh from the oven uh but
[29:35] uh at that time you know eventually I
[29:38] was sort of despaired uh I felt like one
[29:42] my company died second my company died
[29:44] FR company died you know one of my
[29:46] projects died that I got a hope that
[29:48] it's going to blow up it's going to do
[29:50] something for me my company failed me uh
[29:53] not my company but company that I work
[29:55] for failed me kind of I was going above
[29:57] and beyond and then you know in the in a
[30:00] in January I asked for a raise and they
[30:02] told me you can get a 10% well
[30:04] cumulated cumulated you know uh
[30:08] inflation for the last like three years
[30:10] were like 30% in Poland so I basically
[30:13] when I started there I started like a
[30:14] two and a half year ago I was making
[30:16] less than I was doing
[30:17] making when I started and it crushed me
[30:21] you know and I started to explore this
[30:22] Bitcoin thing like okay but there is one
[30:24] thing that hasn't failed me like Bitcoin
[30:26] is growing you know uh uh it's going up
[30:29] I started the buying in
[30:31] 2022 uh and as like buying every single
[30:34] month it is the story from the trader to
[30:37] the
[30:38] Moxi and eventually I thought myself
[30:41] okay so so many things failed in my life
[30:43] so many Financial like my my companies
[30:46] or like whenever I want to make some
[30:48] more money everything fails it's
[30:50] probably someone thinks because of me
[30:52] some of this is because of the system
[30:54] that we're living and then I thought to
[30:56] myself okay let's just explore this
[30:58] Bitcoin thing like it is growing it's
[30:59] the only thing that's not failing me you
[31:01] know i' never been bad like whenever I
[31:03] bought Bitcoin it it's of course in the
[31:06] short term it might have dipped for a
[31:08] bit but eventually was going up and up
[31:10] and up and up you know I say like you
[31:12] know let's just explore the thing what
[31:14] is it about what is this technology like
[31:16] I perceived it before like uh you know
[31:19] maybe a new Facebook like for for
[31:22] information for social media right or
[31:24] it's like like micep like when you have
[31:26] a micep and Facebook I thought to myself
[31:28] like okay maybe to the current system
[31:30] the Bitcoin is the Facebook to the
[31:31] Myspace or something like that but just
[31:33] said like okay let's just explore it
[31:35] because it seems like very beneficial
[31:37] for me and I started to explore it and I
[31:39] stumbled upon a book from savy and Amos
[31:42] the Bitcoin standard and by the way this
[31:44] book was sitting on my shelf for like a
[31:46] half a year and you know I thought to
[31:49] myself I don't want you know I bought it
[31:52] but I thought to myself like I don't
[31:54] want to read it I already know
[31:55] everything about Bitcoin you know like
[31:57] what can I learn right so and eventually
[32:00] I started reading it and it's you know
[32:03] it just sparked in my brain like I felt
[32:07] like just like when you have those this
[32:09] puzzles you know all together like all
[32:12] around laying around all these
[32:14] experiences or these bad emotions or
[32:16] these bad things and eventually you know
[32:18] this book just like pulled all the
[32:20] strings together and just basically like
[32:23] like an Arch Reactor in the Iron Man
[32:24] suit you know just pull it in and from
[32:27] this empty shell you are just this bunch
[32:30] of scraped metal you just started to
[32:33] breathe and and think and then I got
[32:36] from safety I got into sailor and I
[32:39] promise I'm getting into the loan thing
[32:41] but I want to know I want to tell you
[32:43] the background right like it's easy to
[32:44] say like oh I just took it along b a
[32:46] Bitcoin right but I guess like what
[32:48] pushed me to do it right
[32:51] so and I started to watch you know after
[32:54] saving I just uh decided like there's
[32:57] this guy that is just buying Bitcoin or
[33:00] something he's talking about Bitcoin all
[33:02] day like what is this guy doing even
[33:06] right like and I and I watched this Lex
[33:08] Friedman podcast with sailor right was
[33:10] the first interaction with sailor I had
[33:14] and uh I watched it whole thing it is
[33:17] like five hours or something I
[33:19] understood maybe half of it and I said
[33:22] like okay this guy is brilliant he he's
[33:25] talking about some very interesting
[33:28] things but I don't I know that this is
[33:30] valuable what he's talking about but I
[33:31] don't I don't understand what he's
[33:33] talking about right and eventually I
[33:35] watched it the second time then I
[33:36] watched it with like chat GPT and when I
[33:38] I asked him on the go like okay he's
[33:40] talking about this it's just like
[33:42] convertible bonds what is a convertible
[33:44] Bond you know like it's it's it's it's
[33:47] hard to comprehend such a terminology
[33:49] from a financial system when you're you
[33:51] know when you barely know about what is
[33:53] inflation or some some basic stuff right
[33:55] some scalers they're talking about like
[33:57] this this is a great conversation this
[33:59] this uh absolute Banger this interview
[34:03] and it has only like million views it is
[34:06] a joke it should have like 100 million
[34:09] views or something by the way So
[34:12] eventually I started to listen to sailor
[34:14] then I watched this podcast I understood
[34:16] it partially still not
[34:18] 100% till this day I watched it probably
[34:20] like four or five times uh and then I
[34:24] started to go on this bench watching of
[34:26] all of his podcasts right
[34:28] for the last half a year and there was a
[34:30] bunch of them because at that time he
[34:32] was doing like a lot of
[34:34] podcasts and eventually you know
[34:38] um he he gave me this idea right like
[34:41] but you know since Bitcoin is kind of a
[34:45] 30% uh risk-free annual returns like why
[34:50] don't you get a mortgage why don't you
[34:52] get a loan that you know that rate is
[34:54] 10% and just it's just easy easy money
[34:57] Printing and I thought to myself no it's
[35:00] a crazy idea it's a crazy idea I'm not
[35:02] going to take a loan to to buy a Bitcoin
[35:03] right uh it also like it didn't fit in
[35:07] my brain at the time but eventually you
[35:10] know the more I learned about Bitcoin
[35:12] how it works it that this is not a
[35:14] speculative asset asset right like
[35:17] because most of the people I still at
[35:18] the time was thinking like it's a
[35:19] speculative asset a little bit it might
[35:22] go it goes down a lot you know I don't
[35:25] know is it going to succeed or not you
[35:28] know you got to answer all these
[35:29] questions before you take this loan
[35:31] right you got to be you got to be
[35:33] prepared the loan is leverage kind of
[35:36] right so if you want to take a leverage
[35:38] you got to be very very convinced that
[35:40] the asset you're buying doesn't matter
[35:42] what it is I guess uh doesn't matter
[35:44] what
[35:45] the what
[35:47] the uh investment is right you got to
[35:51] really really learn about what you're
[35:53] doing right before you do that so that's
[35:55] why I do not recommend it to everyone
[35:57] that's that's why it's not a financial
[35:58] advice you got to have like a very
[36:00] stable uh understanding what a Bitcoin
[36:03] is before you do this where unless
[36:05] you're a DJ and just going to to to put
[36:08] on a some
[36:10] leverage and go trade it on on a binance
[36:14] or whatever so it it was marinating in
[36:17] my brain for a while I was going a lot
[36:20] of back and forth no I can do it right
[36:22] like okay I should do it okay no I can't
[36:24] do it and eventually after I learned I
[36:26] decided okay I have to do it you know
[36:28] because eventually what that mean for me
[36:30] it is okay this is quite a big loan but
[36:34] it's like three years of my savings if I
[36:37] take it so at the end of the day three
[36:39] years of savings to me it was like huh
[36:43] okay you know it's quite a lot but I can
[36:45] make it if I lose it all if a Bitcoin
[36:47] goes to zero I lost three years of
[36:50] savings you know and if a Bitcoin goes
[36:52] to 10 million a coin I win everything
[36:56] right like it's like the risk to reward
[37:00] ratio
[37:02] eventually it is uncomparable right it's
[37:06] like to the some extent it seemed to me
[37:09] like brainless decision to do it like
[37:12] yeah it's it's the the risk reward is so
[37:15] high that if I don't make this decision
[37:17] then you know maybe I shouldn't go out
[37:19] of my house because I'm afraid of
[37:22] something bad is happening to me you
[37:23] know maybe I'm going to sit in my home
[37:25] all day and for the next 10 years
[37:27] because I'm afraid to go out on the
[37:28] street maybe something bad happens to me
[37:30] right so yeah like I feel it's operating
[37:35] eventually Bitcoin is operating on such
[37:37] a low level of risk in my opinion it's
[37:41] such a low level of risk that like Point
[37:45] me one thing that this less risky and
[37:49] it's giving such a high returns uh you
[37:51] know I can cannot think right now about
[37:54] anything uh like this that's why I made
[37:56] this decision eventually I pulled the
[37:58] trigger and by the way you know it's the
[38:01] not the end of the story because then I
[38:03] got hit by the system right you get the
[38:06] loan you want to buy Bitcoin for it
[38:10] like be prepared you know like be
[38:13] prepared like first of all uh I couldn't
[38:15] make such a big transfer from my bank
[38:19] account to the crypto exchange where I
[38:21] wanted to buy it right I had to split it
[38:24] in half and then you know once you split
[38:27] it in half then you send a one transfer
[38:29] and there's goes like oh you are you
[38:32] sure you want to send that that big of
[38:34] an amount right like uh we got to
[38:36] confirm that with you uh we're going to
[38:39] call you right I'm like what do you mean
[38:41] you're going to call me right and this
[38:42] is also like a learning curve with the
[38:44] loan is you're you you know it I learned
[38:48] so much from the this experience not
[38:50] only you know you want to buy something
[38:52] with your own money you want to you're
[38:55] if you I don't even imagine how well
[38:57] wealthy individuals actually wealthy
[38:58] people live like that I don't know but
[39:01] if you want to make an example like a
[39:03] million dollar transfer from someone I
[39:06] don't know I've made significantly less
[39:08] but it still was such a big hustle right
[39:11] like I send it to the crypto exchange
[39:14] and they asked like okay we're going to
[39:15] call you I said okay where's the number
[39:17] I'm going to call you you know just make
[39:19] this transfer right now because I feel
[39:21] like Bitcoin is going to blow up soon it
[39:23] was at the time you know in October it
[39:25] was right before it just smashed from
[39:29] 60k to like 90k so I was lucky I was
[39:31] super lucky and I was just I knew it's
[39:34] coming okay maybe I knew it's coming I
[39:37] don't have a glass Ball but I like
[39:39] eventually we all know that going the
[39:41] Bitcoin the faster you buy Bitcoin the
[39:44] the the you know the more you're GNA uh
[39:47] get on the other end out of it right um
[39:51] the faster you buy Bitcoin the more you
[39:52] can buy uh for your own Fiat because
[39:54] you're going to can in the future you'll
[39:56] buy less and less for youri yet so I was
[39:58] I was very I was shaking inside like
[40:01] come on just I want to buy this Bitcoin
[40:03] what's going on they didn't let me
[40:05] through this bank transfer they they
[40:07] canceled they declined it but before
[40:09] they declined I had a call she was like
[40:12] there was someone on the line asking
[40:13] like oh do you have a financial advisor
[40:15] I said no uh do you know that the crypto
[40:20] possessed some risk if you're going to
[40:22] invest you're going to lose it all right
[40:23] and blah blah blah blah blah like I I
[40:25] had like a 15 or 20 minutes call with
[40:27] them I was they they were shooting W to
[40:30] me with whatever they had and eventually
[40:33] at the end of the day they declined
[40:35] it so I had to go to the bank physically
[40:40] I said okay screw that this doesn't work
[40:43] I have to go to the bank I have to show
[40:46] them that I'm sane that I'm sober I
[40:49] don't know and I you really really want
[40:52] to do that right and after that after I
[40:55] went to the bank I still got another
[40:57] call right I see another call but then
[41:01] it went through so one of the transfer
[41:04] out of two went through and the second
[41:06] one I again got a call and and again and
[41:08] it went through right
[41:10] and
[41:12] but this just showed me also right
[41:15] like is this money truly mine right am I
[41:19] am I an idiot right like is this system
[41:22] treating me like I'm an idiot right like
[41:26] maybe there are some of people that you
[41:28] know are idiots and just going to go and
[41:30] trade whatever meme coin they're going
[41:33] to buy on this because they don't know
[41:34] if that I'm going to buy Bitcoin for a
[41:36] long
[41:37] term but
[41:39] uh I don't know it just showed me
[41:42] that if you want to like is this miney
[41:46] truly mine I don't know like it seems
[41:48] like it's it's mine but is it truly mine
[41:52] and on the other hand you got a Bitcoin
[41:53] you want to send $1 million transfer to
[41:56] someone else boom you got 10 minutes on
[41:59] chain or in lightning case right you got
[42:02] seconds and nobody's asking a question
[42:05] right nobody is nobody can censor this
[42:07] nobody can stop this and that even
[42:11] deeper
[42:13] like showed me like how big of a
[42:18] friction how much friction this current
[42:20] system we're living in has for the
[42:22] Commerce right if I want to if I want to
[42:26] uh trade with someone across the world
[42:29] it's so hard like it's so hard like
[42:32] that's why Bitcoin can change it remove
[42:35] all this friction from the whole system
[42:38] and make all of our lives easily EAS
[42:41] easier right I partnered up with coin
[42:45] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[42:48] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[42:50] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[42:53] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[42:56] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[42:59] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[43:02] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[43:04] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[43:08] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[43:11] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[43:14] watch collections you have the date of
[43:16] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[43:20] there and of course also the block
[43:22] height and which EPO we are currently in
[43:25] I love the level of of detail they put
[43:28] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[43:31] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[43:33] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[43:36] love those watches so so much if you
[43:39] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[43:42] regular basis I guess you already bought
[43:44] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[43:47] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[43:50] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[43:52] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[43:54] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[43:57] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[43:59] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[44:02] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[44:06] with the code Robin at the checkout
[44:08] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[44:12] your bitbox and the next step is to
[44:14] really level up your sovereignty as an
[44:17] individual you have to have the most
[44:19] secure self- custody setup you have to
[44:22] secure your own devices you have to
[44:25] protect your privacy you have to set up
[44:27] an inheritance plan and depending on
[44:30] where you live you even want to have a
[44:32] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[44:35] in case something goes really really
[44:37] wrong and through all those steps the
[44:39] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step

[44:51] how you can level up your sovereignty
[44:54] [Music]
[44:57] that that that was that was a lot in
[44:59] there and and I L it all the way uh
[45:03] especially the moment when when the
[45:06] banking system kind of puts the barriers
[45:08] in and they're trying really really hard
[45:10] but I think they get now that they have
[45:13] to praise it more and more there's in
[45:16] Germany already a bank that fully impr
[45:18] Praises Bitcoin you can buy Bitcoin with
[45:20] them you can custody it that with them
[45:22] they are doing one of the biggest uh
[45:25] germane speaking Bitcoin events which is
[45:27] really good and has good speakers uh and
[45:29] they are hosting like a thousand people
[45:31] there uh so so they're actually
[45:34] embracing it and they also embracing
[45:36] Bitcoin not crypto like they get the
[45:38] signal of it uh which is
[45:40] amazing um so slowly slowly there are
[45:43] there here and their Banks uh that
[45:47] actually get it and actually embrace
[45:50] Bitcoin but there are banks
[45:53] like seemingly your bank uh that that
[45:56] they don't want that and they they want
[45:59] to protect the consumer and uh don't
[46:03] want uh people to to invest in Bitcoin
[46:06] which is very sad because either there's
[46:09] an agenda behind that or they are
[46:12] seriously that
[46:15] uninformed I I say it very
[46:16] diplomatically now but they the
[46:19] the either one of two I don't know
[46:23] especially because I don't know your
[46:24] bank also uh but there Are banks that
[46:28] embrace it and there are banks that
[46:30] don't embrace it uh and I think those
[46:33] banks that Embrace Bitcoin now the
[46:36] regional Banks I'm not talking about the
[46:38] central banks they have a chance of
[46:40] actually surviving maybe they can find
[46:44] uh actually valuable services and
[46:47] products around Bitcoin they can offer
[46:49] to their customers uh and then they can
[46:52] survive even without the Fiat system
[46:55] like that's possible but I can guarantee
[46:58] you those Banks who don't do that they
[47:00] they will uh suffer a lot and maybe even
[47:05] suffer to death at to some point so um I
[47:09] hate all interactions with banks and I
[47:12] have a story like I got a physical check
[47:14] I don't have it anymore uh but I got a
[47:16] physical check from a old landlord
[47:19] around
[47:20] 30 and I cannot redeem it here in
[47:23] Austria I got that from Germany and I
[47:27] simply cannot redeem it anywhere here in
[47:30] Austria because they would need to send
[47:34] that check to the uh to the headquarter
[47:38] physically to see if it's backed and
[47:40] then they can give me cash for 30 years
[47:43] so I decided to just throw it away
[47:46] because after you could have put it on
[47:47] the wall as a sign you know of a of a
[47:51] bad system so it reminds me every day
[47:53] like okay this is what I'm fighting for
[47:55] you know enraged me so much that I don't
[47:58] want any reminder to
[48:00] it like it was
[48:03] like luckily it was just
[48:06] 30 uh because if if it wouldn't be like
[48:10] 100 EUR or more it would really annoy me
[48:13] and then I would have had to email those
[48:16] people and a that I really don't want to
[48:19] do that but I wasn't three different uh
[48:23] uh Banks here in Austria they all told
[48:25] me oh they don't take it anymore or you
[48:27] have to be a customer to to take it like
[48:31] I'm I'm not a I'm not a customer sorry
[48:34] so yeah the the banking system and this
[48:36] uh has a lot of weird things that I
[48:38] really disagree with and I think that's
[48:40] the things that will bring them down
[48:43] eventually really cool so you took the
[48:45] loan out and and you're doing that now
[48:48] um is as you said is there anything
[48:50] where like okay it's not for every
[48:52] person it's not uh is anything that you
[48:55] could recommend of like okay then you
[48:57] should not do and stuff like that
[49:00] well I think it's it's very hard to tell
[49:03] I feel like I myself personally also it
[49:06] come boils down maybe to some risk um
[49:10] like how to put it in life you accept
[49:13] some level of risk some of people accept
[49:16] lower level of risk some of the people
[49:18] are accepting higher levels of risks
[49:21] this is what the seller is like
[49:22] sometimes saying about his stocks right
[49:24] like some people just buy Bitcoin hold
[49:27] it's fine some of the people that accept
[49:29] more risk they just buy msdr buy it and
[49:32] some of them are buying MDX right and
[49:34] just trade trading it on Leverage it's
[49:36] like 2x leverage on MDX and they're fine
[49:39] with that so it depends on you and uh
[49:43] depends really hardly depends on your
[49:46] financial condition like in my case you
[49:47] know the I took this this is 10 years
[49:50] loan uh and I took it for as long as I
[49:53] can so uh I pay as little
[49:57] um every month and for me it's like less
[50:01] than a 10% of my monthly income right so
[50:06] I would say this is very very on on a
[50:09] conservative side uh of things it's very
[50:12] hard to tell uh just give a universal
[50:17] here
[50:18] um um advice to anyone but I think it's
[50:23] very much worth exploring but first of
[50:27] all you just got to study Bitcoin right
[50:29] this is the most this is most important
[50:31] factor that taking a loan is just last
[50:34] piece of the whole whole story right
[50:37] just study Bitcoin put in those thousand
[50:41] hours or something in a Bitcoin
[50:43] right and then think again right just
[50:46] take a deep breath think again should
[50:48] you do it should you not do it uh I
[50:51] think in most of the cases I think the
[50:53] answer should be like yes you should do
[50:55] it probably
[50:57] because it just makes a lot of sense
[51:00] right uh you should take advantage of
[51:03] the system that is uh that is killing
[51:06] you and just take this take take take
[51:10] take that bad thing from the system just
[51:13] make it a good thing right and buy
[51:15] Bitcoin and just just hold it uh for a
[51:17] long
[51:18] time absolutely yeah do do you think
[51:22] there's a similar depth system on on on
[51:25] bitcoin is there some similar system
[51:27] that you uh foresee once we get to a
[51:30] Bitcoin standard yeah I think I think uh
[51:34] on a Bitcoin standard so yes this is
[51:36] this is the thing right like uh on a
[51:38] Bitcoin standard the if you're taking a
[51:42] depth uh in a full Reserve System like
[51:46] full Bitcoin Reserve System right this
[51:48] is a moral thing to do this is not
[51:50] something it might not be wise thing to
[51:52] do right to take a to take a loan but it
[51:55] might it is not
[51:57] une unethical like it is right now
[52:00] immoral like it is right now right
[52:02] because eventually if I give you my
[52:05] Bitcoin and you tell me like okay um I'm
[52:09] going to invest this Bitcoin uh from you
[52:12] uh and just do do with it whatever you
[52:15] want right I'm not diluting the system
[52:17] I'm not expanding the system of money
[52:20] still the same right I just gave someone
[52:23] my Bitcoin and this is how I think it
[52:25] should work eventually
[52:27] uh should you do it should there be any
[52:30] loans like uh I recently was watching
[52:33] Jack MERS he he he's thinking about his
[52:35] new product about uh Bitcoin
[52:38] collateralized loans uh I haven't
[52:41] explored this uh for now um for now my
[52:45] plan is just simple I'm not taking any
[52:47] loans I just have a cash flow I just
[52:49] have enough cash flow that I'm satisfied
[52:51] of maybe in the future if I will need
[52:53] some more money or whatever the money is
[52:57] going to be because you know if if it's
[52:58] on the Bitcoin standard what's what is
[53:00] the thing that you're going to lend me
[53:02] right like what's the like if you give
[53:05] me your Bitcoin what is the collateral
[53:08] I'm giving to you right like what what
[53:10] is the thing you're going to accept
[53:12] right like my house uh something
[53:14] valuable probably right because uh
[53:17] you're going to make it count the
[53:19] Bitcoin that you're giving up because if
[53:20] it is if it's going to appreciate by
[53:23] itself because when the productivity of
[53:26] our Humanity of the economy is growing
[53:29] year by year right you're you're making
[53:31] money just by holding the Bitcoin it's
[53:33] the deflationary system so when you ask
[53:35] me on a Bitcoin standard it's tough to I
[53:38] never like explored myself this field
[53:41] what would it mean um because Bitcoin is
[53:44] going to be their money what I'm giving
[53:47] you uh what I'm giving you if you want
[53:50] to land the Bitcoin from me uh what are
[53:52] you giving me in exchange right what's
[53:54] the collateral uh on this this one but
[53:57] in a Fiat system I guess it is possible
[54:00] uh for now um let's see how it goes I
[54:02] was thinking about it like how do they
[54:04] create this product it's interesting
[54:06] idea like okay I got some Bitcoin I want
[54:09] to get a loan so how much for my one
[54:11] Bitcoin how am I going to get uh in
[54:14] exchange was it like 10% 20% so I going
[54:17] to get like
[54:19] $20,000 why only $20,000 because you're
[54:22] not going to get like the full amount
[54:24] right because what if the Bitcoin dips
[54:26] 50% right then they don't want to be
[54:29] behind because also they take this money
[54:31] from some other bank right they they're
[54:33] just like intermediary like if strike is
[54:35] going to do this product it's going to
[54:36] be an intermediary so uh I don't know
[54:41] how it's going to work but if I'm
[54:43] getting like 10 or 20% for my Bitcoin I
[54:46] don't know if it's worth it I don't know
[54:48] if it's worth it they have to I don't
[54:50] know how they're going to build this
[54:51] product I'm very interested to look for
[54:54] forward to it I never explored it
[54:57] let's see how it goes right but most
[54:59] likely my scenario is I'm not I'm not
[55:02] lending anyone on my Bitcoin uh I'm not
[55:05] getting a loan against my Bitcoin as
[55:07] Bitcoin is a
[55:08] collateral uh the plan is simple I think
[55:11] the the the just buy Bitcoin hold
[55:14] Bitcoin stock sets just and until we get
[55:18] to the phase where the Bitcoin is the
[55:20] unit of
[55:22] account uh I'm just going to hold it
[55:25] maybe maybe I buy some Bitcoin I buy
[55:27] some Bitcoin and I I I spend it uh on uh
[55:31] bit bit raffle from time to time just
[55:33] buying some some stuff I tried to do it
[55:37] but it's very Cluny at this moment
[55:40] uh but yeah about the loans let's see
[55:42] what the future brings I'm not the
[55:44] financial expert I'm not the I'm not the
[55:46] biggest Financial
[55:47] brain uh and you can judge it by my past
[55:50] right like this is this guy that took a
[55:53] bunch of short-term loans and then run
[55:55] into troubles like Eureka
[55:58] like who would have thought it happens
[56:00] right like nobody nobody could have seen
[56:03] that coming right I couldn't see that
[56:04] comment so I guess uh I don't know
[56:08] what's coming in the loans system for
[56:10] now against Bitcoin I hope there's
[56:13] something interesting coming I hope
[56:15] there's because I I really don't I I
[56:18] don't like getting my Bitcoin in in some
[56:23] exchange to get some dollars out of
[56:24] there like that seems to be wrong for me
[56:28] uh I prefer I don't I I'm I'm I'm ready
[56:32] to pay more interest on a normal
[56:37] loan uh before I give up some of my
[56:40] Bitcoin or risk some of my Bitcoin like
[56:44] if I get 4% interest rates with
[56:47] collateral versus 8% without collateral
[56:50] I take the
[56:51] 8% uh I I I pay a little bit more than
[56:54] with collateral uh and actually with
[56:57] collateral most of them are still like 7
[57:01] 8% the the the products that I've seen
[57:03] out there from Bitcoin so that's really
[57:06] unattractive for me they have to be
[57:09] super low like 1% 2% interest rate 0%
[57:13] interest ratees stuff like that I'm like
[57:15] oh that that might be interesting but
[57:17] then you have to see like how are they
[57:18] securing the Bitcoin how how am I how do
[57:22] I make sure they are not running away
[57:24] with my Bitcoin because if they give me
[57:26] 0% interest rate and I give them one
[57:29] Bitcoin and they run away with that and
[57:31] I have
[57:32] $20,000 yeah I lost a lot of money on
[57:35] that not a best deal that's not the best
[57:37] idea so it it seems to
[57:40] be uh an an hard topic to to
[57:45] crack but uh it could be interesting to
[57:48] get uh money against your Bitcoin but
[57:51] I'm not willing to give anyone my
[57:54] Bitcoin I I'm willing to prove that a
[57:58] public
[57:59] address uh is actually mine and prove
[58:03] that with a signature um that's possible
[58:07] uh but I'm not willing to give them my
[58:10] Bitcoin uh it's it's uh it's the same
[58:14] thing like uh you should be able to do
[58:17] that without transferring your Bitcoin
[58:21] uh and if if I'm not able to do that I
[58:23] will not do it that that that's a
[58:27] may
[58:29] stri you can keep it in just sign
[58:32] aaction to prove that the Bitcoin are
[58:34] actually yours they said that it won't
[58:36] happen you will have to give them your
[58:39] Bitcoin they they confirmed it I believe
[58:41] it was on last podcast or something that
[58:43] they're thinking about this product but
[58:45] you'll have to give it give it away to
[58:46] their custody right so you have to trust
[58:49] Jack MERS he's a great guy don't get me
[58:51] wrong like I would probably trust him
[58:54] but still you know I think in a Bitcoin
[58:58] Community yeah in a Bitcoin Community
[59:00] it's a very very hard thing to do
[59:03] because we don't trust right which is
[59:06] very fine I I I don't trust uh I don't
[59:10] trust anyone else with with my Bitcoin
[59:12] I'm so sorry sorry but uh not even you
[59:17] even though don't you up to anything I
[59:19] respect that I respect that and I think
[59:22] this is a super important message to all
[59:24] the viewers right like just
[59:26] and it's also like yeah I love the motto
[59:29] of Bitcoin this is what also hit me
[59:31] because I was you know even before bit I
[59:33] got into Bitcoin I was like I was making
[59:36] some videos on a YouTube right and where
[59:38] I was reviewing something an example
[59:41] whatever that is right and I was I
[59:43] always like to finish my episode with
[59:46] like saying okay but at the end of the
[59:48] day you know I'm just a guy on the
[59:49] internet just verify it yourself right
[59:53] and that's what hit me also with a
[59:55] Bitcoin that
[59:56] the Moto is right don't trust verify
[60:00] right and I really really I really
[60:04] really love that and we should yeah
[60:06] limit our trust uh to someone else
[60:08] holding our back we should trust ourself
[60:12] primarily how how was that for you the
[60:15] because you said you are fairly recently
[60:17] a Bitcoin Maxi how was that um uh change
[60:21] in your brain the change in the
[60:23] transformation that you went through did
[60:26] anything else uh change besides just
[60:29] like being focused on on bitcoin only
[60:32] did you live through anything oh yeah
[60:34] definitely I think I think it boils down
[60:37] to the time preference this is what also
[60:41] struck me I think this is the most thing
[60:43] important thing that struck me in Saving
[60:45] book the Bitcoin standard that I would
[60:48] like to really recommend to anyone I
[60:49] think it's also like a great starter
[60:51] pack if you want to you know if you
[60:53] already introduced Bitcoin to someone
[60:55] some of your friends you want to just
[60:57] push it a little bit further just give
[60:59] them the book save is really he he he he
[61:03] did a great fantastic job of doing it so
[61:06] I think the thinking I started to think
[61:10] more a long term uh so my time
[61:14] preference got a little bit lower and uh
[61:18] also like I think like Bitcoin empowered
[61:20] me in a way that now when I hold my
[61:22] Bitcoin you know I feel because I'm a it
[61:26] manager uh I do I do I'm a product owner
[61:30] uh and I feel like it made me a better
[61:33] product manager because eventually you
[61:37] know when you have a Bitcoin behind you
[61:40] right you like I was thinking about it
[61:43] from time to time in my job right boss
[61:46] is coming to me and he's very important
[61:48] person and he's trying to push something
[61:50] on you right like okay do this or do
[61:51] that right but you know sometime you
[61:53] know better than him because he's way up
[61:56] there he's not he's barely singular
[61:58] product right but he has some idea he
[61:59] would like to push on but he doesn't
[62:01] know that the thing that he's going to
[62:03] push on is going to actually break the
[62:05] product not help it right so when you
[62:09] don't have savings behind you when you
[62:12] or the best I think the best form of
[62:14] saving is Bitcoin where you don't have a
[62:16] Bitcoin behind
[62:17] you maybe you're going to say okay
[62:19] whatever I'm going to do it right I'm
[62:22] just going to be polite I'm just going
[62:24] to okay let's let's do it I'm I'm not
[62:26] going to say no because he's going to
[62:28] get angry and maybe he's going to fire
[62:30] me and if I don't have a savings you
[62:32] know uh they pay me well I live from
[62:36] first day on the month to the ne from
[62:38] paycheck to paycheck right and it's very
[62:41] hard when you're living from a paycheck
[62:43] to paycheck to say no to someone in a
[62:46] power because he's gonna fire you and
[62:49] what are you gonna do right there is a
[62:50] chance he's going to fire you right but
[62:52] there's also a chance that he's going to
[62:55] respect that and appreciate that and
[62:57] it's going to help the company and it's
[63:00] going to help your product to build it
[63:02] to build a better product because you're
[63:04] sovereign individual you can't say no to
[63:06] people right you can say more often no
[63:08] to people because you don't have to rely
[63:12] on them like throwing you a bone right
[63:14] you got already the a bunch of Bones uh
[63:17] you know in your savings account in in a
[63:20] cold
[63:21] storage so you can sell to those people
[63:23] know and eventually if they're smart
[63:27] they're going to respect
[63:28] that uh because most of the people I
[63:32] guess I don't know maybe I'm not going
[63:34] to talk about most of the people I don't
[63:35] know but seems like a lot of people
[63:37] struggle with it right like someone in
[63:39] power comes to them and they just say
[63:41] okay yes maybe if they would have a
[63:42] Bitcoin it would be easier for them to
[63:44] tell no and eventually if you say no you
[63:47] know they're going to respect you and
[63:48] maybe they you're going to get a better
[63:49] salary because you're a more Sovereign
[63:53] more more confident person I feel like
[63:55] like I'm more confident also because I
[63:58] have a Bitcoin and this confidence in a
[64:01] daily life uh it it's it's it's like
[64:05] working in a background like it maybe I
[64:08] cannot pinpoint a specific situation we
[64:10] I say like oh yes when I had a Bitcoin
[64:12] behind my back I just made this great
[64:14] deal right but this boost of confidence
[64:16] that this gives you it it empowers you
[64:19] in even in those smaller decisions right
[64:21] if you're more confident if you're more
[64:24] courageous uh you take your life you
[64:27] take the bull by the horn which is
[64:29] called life right and you are on the
[64:32] driving seat you're in the driving seat
[64:34] you're no longer just sitting in a bag
[64:36] and so whoever else is just driving
[64:38] right it also Bitcoin forces you to do
[64:40] it like you want to you want to be
[64:42] sovereign individual you want to hold
[64:44] your own seat phrase like you you got to
[64:48] if you want to do all those things right
[64:50] the freedom comes with a cost like it's
[64:52] not for
[64:53] free and uh if you want do all these
[64:56] things it it pushes you to to be a
[64:59] sovereign
[65:00] individual uh to to take a seat uh in
[65:05] the wheel not to s in the back just and
[65:08] someone else is driving whoever is this
[65:10] like your boss uh the current Economist
[65:12] or your politician or whoever that is
[65:16] right interesting how has your
[65:18] definition of freedom changed or did it
[65:20] change in in in that time oh that's
[65:23] interesting that's interesting question
[65:26] how my definition of freedom
[65:28] changed
[65:30] huh
[65:31] uh I don't know if my
[65:34] uh
[65:36] definitely definitely definitely it
[65:39] changed the way that uh the more Bitcoin
[65:41] you have the more freedom I
[65:43] have I don't know if the definition
[65:45] changed but the more Bitcoin I have the
[65:47] more free I feel I am the
[65:51] the the more I watch into the future to
[65:54] what to my retire I'm 32 years old and I
[65:58] I sometimes maybe it's not right fault
[65:59] to have I don't know but sometimes feel
[66:01] like you know we're all going going to
[66:03] die right eventually and I think
[66:06] sometimes about my death and I think
[66:08] about my retirement I think about my
[66:10] kids I think about the future I think it
[66:13] pushed me to to to think about the
[66:16] future uh of myself and how I'm going to
[66:18] retire
[66:20] and also when I have my Bitcoin I feel
[66:22] like I feel like I sleep safer even
[66:24] though I had a loan on my back I still
[66:26] feel like I sleep like a kid like a
[66:28] little child uh in a bed I I really go
[66:31] down to bed and it just this is a
[66:34] freedom to me too right like you go you
[66:37] go to sleep and you're calm you're
[66:40] you're more calmer than you
[66:43] are uh that you would you would wear
[66:46] without a Bitcoin right
[66:50] uh so yeah I don't know if I answer your
[66:53] question but uh
[66:57] that's it about Bitcoin and the freedom
[66:58] of Bitcoin I love that yeah it's it's
[67:01] super interesting how how how Bitcoin
[67:04] can change uh someone's perspective on
[67:07] on on freedom or not change it depending
[67:09] on on where they already are um really
[67:12] cool we I have a bunch of topics but uh
[67:15] we are already kind of at the end of the
[67:17] podcast and asked each and every one of
[67:19] my guests one question and it is what
[67:21] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin uh
[67:24] what can we learn uh yes I think you can
[67:27] learn from me a lot about diet it's
[67:30] actually interesting usually people get
[67:32] to bitcoin first and then they get to
[67:34] the diet thing but I actually was first
[67:37] in a diet like a keto and carnivore and
[67:41] then I discovered Bitcoin and you know
[67:43] it clicked also like Sav in Amos he's
[67:46] he's a carnivore as I understand so I
[67:48] looked at the list and it was like satus
[67:51] bitcoiner carnivore hm interesting uh
[67:56] sailor he was also talking about a
[67:58] carnivore diet so Bitcoin Maxi carnivore
[68:01] hm it's not a coincidence right you
[68:03] start to think like when you when you
[68:05] look around you feel like uh there's not
[68:08] many people on Carnivore diet so it's
[68:10] really rare to see someone talking
[68:11] publicly about it right and especially
[68:13] like a public figure so and then you
[68:16] know I went on the orange pill up there
[68:18] was a guy this living next to me Bitcoin
[68:21] Maxi carnivore it start feel like what
[68:24] is going on right and also like started
[68:26] to drill this hole in my brain maybe
[68:29] there's something about a Bitcoin and a
[68:31] carnivore and they somehow connected to
[68:32] each other so guys if you want to find
[68:35] out some some more about me about diet
[68:38] uh and you want to talk about diet uh
[68:40] I'm a I'm a big big carnivore freak I
[68:43] talk a lot about the diet about the keto
[68:46] about a
[68:47] carnivore uh so you can learn I don't
[68:50] know if a lot but I spent a lot of time
[68:52] studying these two topics because at
[68:53] some point I was just super obese
[68:56] uh my weight was like I was 120 kilo and
[68:59] eventually I pulled it down to like 75
[69:02] then I go went up like 90 where I am
[69:05] right now but it's because I uh screwed
[69:08] up and uh yeah I went went off the
[69:11] carnivore di because it's sometimes very
[69:12] hard you know in a current
[69:14] Society you know when everybody is
[69:16] eating Fiat food it's sometimes you know
[69:20] too
[69:20] tempting the dark side is tempting and
[69:23] you just get on fall off the wagon and
[69:27] start eating the crappy food so I guess
[69:31] uh if you want to learn more about keto
[69:32] carnivore I'm definitely going to in my
[69:34] social media I'm going to definitely
[69:36] post more about a lot about it because
[69:40] just love this idea and I think there is
[69:42] a lot yet still to discover and learn
[69:44] about it for for for people I love and a
[69:49] lot of people actually bring it up in
[69:50] the in the podcast and our end routine
[69:52] is so perfectly fitting to what we were
[69:56] talking about right now uh because the
[69:58] end is where the previous guest is
[70:00] asking a question for the next guest
[70:01] without knowing who the next guest
[70:03] actually is and the previous guest asked
[70:04] you what would you cook Michael sailor
[70:06] for dinner that is interesting that is
[70:09] interesting but I think I would go with
[70:11] a simple answer I would just cook
[70:14] uh a best t-bone steak I can find uh
[70:20] around I guess I guess it would be just
[70:22] a T-bone steak because this is is my
[70:26] favorite dish and I bet it would be also
[70:29] the best dish for sailor and it would be
[70:30] the healthiest meal for sailor and I
[70:34] really really uh hope he's going to live
[70:38] long and strong for upcoming years so I
[70:42] would really like to cook him something
[70:44] very very
[70:45] healthy
[70:47] uh yeah so I guess it would be a T-bone
[70:50] steak hope he would love that
[70:55] then before I let you go where can
[70:57] people find you ask your questions and
[70:58] reach out to you um excuse me uh where
