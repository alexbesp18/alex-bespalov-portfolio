[00:00] I believe that there was only one person
[00:01] involved in writing code for Bitcoin
[00:03] because if it was a group there wouldn't
[00:05] be a secret about it you can't keep a
[00:07] secret with a group the asymptotically
[00:08] ideal money becomes higher and higher
[00:10] quality and the Fiat no Fiat can compete
[00:13] with it he will become the Prince of
[00:14] Peace eventually as people recognize
[00:17] that it was John Nash that was Satoshi
[00:19] nakam he's going to go down in history
[00:21] as the prince of peace and people won't
[00:22] fully understand that until they
[00:25] understand how good money is the root of
[00:27] all good and how bad money is the root
[00:29] of all evil Bitcoin is going to become
[00:32] the standard measurement of value I
[00:34] think 2025 is going to be one of the
[00:35] most amazing years for Bitcoin ever it's
[00:37] going to go up to a million dollars per
[00:39] coin in 2025 do you think history will
[00:43] recognize CH Nash as to Nakamoto at some
[00:46] [Music]
[00:50] point this is the key point you know
[00:53] people say you know study Bitcoin but
[00:54] the key point for studying John Nash is
[00:57] it gives the most elegant
[01:00] narrative to as to why Bitcoin and and
[01:03] you know the the best narrative wins so
[01:07] so really understanding John Nash I
[01:09] think is the the fastest most efficient
[01:12] way to learn about why Bitcoin
[01:15] interesting um maybe just let's just
[01:17] directly start into that um who is John
[01:20] Nash and and why he's important for for
[01:23] Bitcoin well you know a lot of people
[01:25] know him by a beautiful mind uh that one
[01:27] best pitcher uh that was a about uh you
[01:30] know John Nash and it really focused on
[01:33] his illness 25y year illness with
[01:35] schizophrenia paranoid
[01:37] schizophrenia um and then he recovered
[01:40] from that and then uh but really if you
[01:43] look into his accomplishments which I
[01:45] focused on in Bitcoin and and Nash
[01:47] equilibrium and and most importantly the
[01:50] subtitle which is the emerging Bitcoin
[01:52] equilibrium if if you take the Nash
[01:55] equilibrium and you marry that with
[01:56] Bitcoin you get an emerging Bitcoin equ
[01:59] equum and then you you apply his
[02:02] vocabulary from
[02:03] 1950 forward and it really cleans up
[02:07] what Bitcoin is interesting yeah he I
[02:10] also saw that he wrote something like
[02:12] called like ideal money in the early
[02:15] 2000s if I'm correct asymptotically
[02:18] ideal money uh he he published in 2002
[02:21] ideal money which was let's say a
[02:23] centralize solution but he he talked
[02:26] every time he went somewhere he was
[02:28] always talking about asymptotic ideal
[02:30] money which is really a decentralized
[02:33] way of accomplishing ideal money and and
[02:37] there's you know a lot of people get
[02:39] Bitcoin who are engineers and and
[02:41] software developers and so
[02:43] on because it is about it is mathematics
[02:48] and asymptotically or asymptotic I think
[02:51] most people in the Bitcoin Community
[02:53] would understand what an ASM toote is
[02:55] what asymptotic is but a lot of people
[02:58] don't and you know just to to to bring
[03:01] people up to speed on that imagine you
[03:04] know a line approaching zero but it
[03:06] never does it goes to infinite it's
[03:09] always getting closer and closer but it
[03:10] never touches that line for example zero
[03:13] if you have like 21 million grains of
[03:16] sand and you take half of it away then
[03:19] another four years you take another half
[03:21] away it starts approaching zero but it
[03:25] never gets there and by the way in the
[03:26] white paper Satoshi Nakamoto Snips that
[03:29] tail he mathematically Snips that tail
[03:31] off and and he talks about it in you
[03:34] know in a very proud way because he
[03:35] should be proud of that the mathematical
[03:38] accomplishment there and he puts it
[03:39] right on the white paper so
[03:41] asymptotically ideal money where it's
[03:43] becoming more and more ideal meaning the
[03:46] basement is going
[03:48] down the inflation is going down that's
[03:52] ISM totically ideal money is Bitcoin
[03:56] interesting uh the the Snipping the tail
[03:59] off is basically a fixed supply of 21
[04:01] million that like we don't get smaller
[04:03] and smaller Sates over time but it like
[04:05] we stop at like year 2140 uh basically
[04:09] at some point there um how yeah that's
[04:14] the how how significant is that how is
[04:18] wouldn't it be almost no different if it
[04:22] just goes indefinitely and just like
[04:25] adds like a a few SS and maybe at some
[04:27] point micro SS to to the Bitcoin Network
[04:29] book yeah I I don't think it makes a
[04:31] difference but to a a mathematician
[04:35] who's precise and concise it matters and
[04:39] so to have have something elegant like
[04:41] that you know mattered to someone who
[04:44] was a great mathematician so these are
[04:47] things that were important to John Nash
[04:49] he he wanted the respect he very
[04:51] concerned about the respect of his his
[04:54] peers he didn't care about the respect
[04:57] of you know let's call it the the
[04:59] General Public
[05:00] um that he just ignored he he knew these
[05:02] people considered him you know a
[05:04] paranoid schizophrenic and and but his
[05:08] his
[05:08] peers knew and respected him and these
[05:11] were the things that uh he would you
[05:14] know when he he would uh prove something
[05:17] let's say in in calculus or I excuse me
[05:20] in in in mathematics but then he would
[05:22] go write a program and uh prove it a
[05:26] 100,00 times and then bring back rings
[05:29] of paper and show this to his colleagues
[05:32] and uh so he he was very concerned about
[05:37] achieving uh something
[05:39] beautiful interesting um for those who
[05:43] don't know what is the Nash equilibrium
[05:46] uh like what did he is this like an an
[05:48] article or or like a some what he said
[05:52] uh you know to to really understand John
[05:54] the Nash equilibrium I think you need to
[05:56] understand the history I mean back in
[05:59] 1950 this young
[06:03] uh Master student rolls in from from uh
[06:07] Carnegie and he's rolls into Princeton
[06:11] and he's going to do his PhD there and
[06:14] Von neyman was this well-known guy he
[06:17] he's already he'd already published a a
[06:19] book in 1944 theory of games and
[06:22] economic behavior you know Von nlman he
[06:25] he did the mathematics on lensing the
[06:29] atomic explosion and and for for you
[06:32] know inventing the the atomic bomb and
[06:34] so he was right up there with opener and
[06:37] some of these other people so he had
[06:38] this young kid who rolls in there and uh
[06:42] talks about uh Game Theory and he
[06:45] simplifies it into non-cooperative games
[06:48] and he takes all these concepts of
[06:50] coalitions and Fon nen ideas these very
[06:53] hierarchal ways of doing things and just
[06:56] writes it off as being you know not
[06:58] relevant
[07:00] and uh Von noyman when he was in his
[07:03] office talking to him about the the
[07:06] about the equilibrium you know Von
[07:08] noyman just says it's too simple and and
[07:11] it really hearkens back to uh really the
[07:14] father of modern economics uh you know
[07:17] Adam Smith and The Wealth of Nations
[07:20] that was published in
[07:22] 1776 uh it really breaks it down to
[07:24] something that simple it's just a law of
[07:26] supply and demand but what Nash did he
[07:29] says look
[07:30] it's not just some invisible hand here's
[07:33] the mathematical relationship it's a
[07:35] it's multiple axioms and theorems and he
[07:38] published that in a short paper that
[07:40] which is geometric and indisputable and
[07:44] it establishes an equilibrium really one
[07:46] of the axioms is a fix Point theorem and
[07:49] some other axioms or theorems and uh
[07:52] there's about four things that tie
[07:54] together uh generally speaking and it's
[07:58] it's a short paper and that that became
[08:02] you know that's what he won his Nobel
[08:04] Prize after his 25 year illness it was a
[08:06] reference and cited so often that uh it
[08:10] was just natural that he would win that
[08:13] uh after he recovered uh from his
[08:15] illness and he won the Nobel Prize so so
[08:18] really the the the Nash
[08:21] equilibrium is it's the mathematics
[08:24] between supply and demand uh one of the
[08:27] elements is a fix fix point theorem and
[08:30] it ties into this is what I think is
[08:32] most fascinating and and John Nash uses
[08:34] this vocabulary a lot he talks about the
[08:37] standard measurement of value so if
[08:38] you're heading towards asymptotically
[08:40] ideal money eventually with that
[08:43] equilibrium you're going to have this
[08:44] relationship with standard measurement
[08:46] of value and that what he talked about a
[08:49] lot because you need that for long-term
[08:51] contracts and when you have that
[08:53] standard measurement of value starts to
[08:55] fall apart because people are degrading
[08:57] the quality of money
[09:00] uh long-term contracts start falling
[09:02] apart supply chain starts falling apart
[09:05] I mean everything starts falling apart
[09:09] so this is really important and this
[09:10] hearkens back to his one class in
[09:13] economics that he took in Carnegie in
[09:15] international and
[09:16] economics and or excuse me uh
[09:19] International yeah it was economics and
[09:23] that class was taught by an Austrian
[09:26] economics teacher Austrian economics
[09:30] so he had this very simple way of doing
[09:32] things and Von noyman you know he
[09:34] couldn't believe that you know you got
[09:35] to model these coalitions I mean that
[09:38] conversation that he was having with v
[09:40] neyman is the same conversation that
[09:43] Maxis are having you know Bitcoin Maxis
[09:46] are having with with uh ethereum and you
[09:51] know oh you know these smart contracts
[09:55] is not the is not the big deal here I
[09:58] mean you can do smart contracts with
[10:01] lawyers and or or just write a contract
[10:03] on paper it's a secondary issue the real
[10:07] central theme Here of why Bitcoin is
[10:12] displacing these lesser quality money
[10:15] such as the US dollar it's displacing it
[10:18] over time as as um the asymptotically
[10:21] ideal money becomes higher and higher
[10:25] quality and Fiat no Fiat can compete
[10:27] with it as as it approaches zero and and
[10:31] so you you you'll get that equilibrium
[10:34] it's going to continue to move but
[10:35] eventually it's going to stabilize and
[10:37] then you're going to have this standard
[10:39] measurement of
[10:40] value uh with
[10:43] increasingly
[10:44] everything interesting so it's basically
[10:47] the the theory that we will have to get
[10:50] to one money protocol at some point and
[10:53] this is the most uh pristine money the
[10:57] most sound money the most whatever you
[10:59] want call it money yeah when you when
[11:01] you talk about you know Bitcoin
[11:02] equilibrium or let's talk about standard
[11:04] mission of Val value essentially in the
[11:07] long run you you you're only going to
[11:10] have one you're only going to have one
[11:12] so what does that say about all these
[11:13] you know oh we have more features we
[11:16] have more functions than Bitcoin that's
[11:18] not the point that goes back to this Von
[11:20] noyman oh well we got to model uh
[11:23] coalitions to really understand you know
[11:26] supply and demand it's like um no game
[11:29] the we can make it more simple than that
[11:31] and and that again that's what John Nash
[11:33] was talking about in 1950 but he
[11:35] continued to talk about uh different
[11:38] aspects of that when he published ideal
[11:40] money in 2002 after his
[11:43] illness what were he talking about then
[11:46] like what was the the difference
[11:48] there uh ideal money was look let's get
[11:52] the International Community together
[11:53] let's figure out some kind of index of
[11:56] Commodities or energy or whatever and
[11:58] let's uh let's build high quality money
[12:02] but uh after a while uh he
[12:06] really he always when he went to talk
[12:09] about this around the world at different
[12:11] campuses and different venues he he
[12:14] would say he was going to be talking
[12:16] about ideal money but he would really
[12:18] start talking about asymptotically ideal
[12:20] money because uh
[12:23] fundamentally uh John Nash considered
[12:27] politics and religion
[12:29] to be
[12:31] ineffectual and so he looked
[12:34] at um what he you know he he told his
[12:40] friend at lunch he he was working on the
[12:43] Big Bang a lot of his recovery um you
[12:46] know his his self
[12:48] therapy was just programming and so he
[12:52] did a lot of programming and he also did
[12:54] C++ by the way so he was a great
[12:58] mathematician he was a great
[13:00] cryptographer published a paper and or
[13:02] not published a paper Nash cryptography
[13:05] 1955 sent it to the US government to
[13:08] help them there uh great cryptographer
[13:11] great mathematician great programmer so
[13:15] he has all these elements for a lone
[13:17] genius to put it
[13:19] together uh you also something about the
[13:22] theory of game basically Game Theory uh
[13:26] was this him or was this someone else
[13:28] well well um Von noyman you know he
[13:31] published a paper on theory of of games
[13:33] and economic behavior in
[13:35] 1944 uh Nash published his his
[13:40] dissertation which got his PhD before he
[13:43] was
[13:44] 22 uh on non-cooperative games and you
[13:49] what's interesting about non-cooperative
[13:50] games is if you have a medium of
[13:53] exchange that is you know neutral um
[13:57] what that means is you're you'll get
[13:59] Cooperative behaviors between
[14:02] non-cooperative
[14:04] parties uh this is something that Adam
[14:06] Smith talked about you know a butcher
[14:08] isn't really doing his Service uh
[14:11] because he wants your family to have a
[14:12] nice meal at night he's
[14:15] self-interested and so through what he
[14:18] called the Adam Smith called The
[14:20] Invisible Hand uh you know you get food
[14:24] on your table from the butcher but what
[14:26] John Nash described uh very
[14:30] succinctly he talked about
[14:32] non-cooperative games and from that
[14:35] comes these Cooperative behaviors
[14:37] especially in international relations
[14:38] and that hearkens back to the course he
[14:40] took in
[14:42] Carnegie taught by that Austrian
[14:45] Economist H how do you see that with uh
[14:49] all all the things that you have learned
[14:50] from John Nash and all the other things
[14:52] um how far along are we that Bitcoin
[14:55] will be the the global standard and a
[14:58] stand stand up measurement unit I feel
[15:01] like we we are still like very early
[15:03] we're still like very small uh but we
[15:05] kind of see more and more of that window
[15:09] we see uh that uh we talking more more
[15:12] of like companies adopting Bitcoin more
[15:15] more Nations adopting Bitcoin
[15:16] individuals adopting Bitcoin it feels
[15:18] like we are at the the beginning of some
[15:20] some es adoption or some major event
[15:22] happening how do you see that yeah
[15:26] clearly we're in a situation of Game
[15:28] Theory right and and the highest quality
[15:31] money is going to win uh even but even
[15:34] the way Bitcoin was designed it was
[15:36] designed with Game Theory you take for
[15:38] example mining um in a decentralized
[15:42] fashion which is you know that's Game
[15:46] Theory it's the longest chain wins they
[15:49] don't want to do a you know $100,000
[15:52] worth of Mining and then uh put in a bad
[15:55] transaction that's going to be rejected
[15:57] later on so they're incentivized to keep
[16:01] it honest and and and keep the chain or
[16:04] or keep uh Bitcoin
[16:06] decentralized uh so yeah I think we are
[16:10] Bitcoin is going to become you know the
[16:14] standard measurement of value uh I I
[16:17] believe that um I want to bring up a
[16:20] point here I I just talked about Game
[16:23] Theory and if you look in the white
[16:25] paper you know a lot of these these meme
[16:27] coins out there that say look we've
[16:29] we've got uh we can do a transaction
[16:31] just like Bitcoin without a third party
[16:34] but what they they miss is that the the
[16:36] second Innovation that Satoshi Nakamoto
[16:38] talked about was the decentralized
[16:40] governance and by the way that was a
[16:43] long-term um need that John no uh John
[16:47] Nash was working on in the
[16:50] 1990s and and so he had these these
[16:53] long-term heartfelt needs and uh Adam
[16:56] backs hash uh hasht satisfi both of
[16:59] those needs it is you know a
[17:02] decentralized digital transaction that's
[17:04] number one everyone understands that but
[17:06] what these other meme coins don't
[17:08] understand is they have de that Bitcoin
[17:10] has decentralized governance so all you
[17:14] know Solano etherium none of those guys
[17:16] understand decentralized governments
[17:18] that's the key point so if you if if you
[17:21] if you don't have one you can't have the
[17:23] other you got to have both and otherwise
[17:26] you're going to get regulatory capture
[17:28] and and uh it can be corrupted Bitcoin
[17:32] is the most decentralized especially
[17:35] when it relates to governance and that's
[17:37] why it's that's why Bitcoin is
[17:40] asymptotically ideal money it will
[17:42] approach zero in terms of its uh
[17:46] debasement and uh the inflation rate
[17:49] will go to zero in 140 years but we know
[17:53] it's it's because of its uh value keeps
[17:56] increasing that
[17:59] it it actually rewards because it goes
[18:01] up in value the Savers the wage earners
[18:04] the conservationists and those who are
[18:05] using it for long-term contracts in
[18:07] terms of investment so it benefits all
[18:10] of those parties in terms of
[18:14] having uh the medium of Exchange in
[18:17] terms of money going up in value as
[18:20] opposed of it as opposed to it being the
[18:22] base which rewards those who are in debt
[18:26] such as the government and the bank
[18:29] I also love that Bitcoin rewards
[18:32] responsibility uh and uh rewards those
[18:35] who can take responsibility and I kind
[18:38] of uh finds those who are not able to
[18:43] take the
[18:44] responsibility and which brings us to
[18:46] the point that it's even like
[18:49] deflationary because people lose their
[18:50] coins people uh maybe want to also uh
[18:55] give the coins away when they are when
[18:57] they're dying and stuff like that
[18:59] so the amount of Bitcoin will probably
[19:01] shrink over time and not stay the same
[19:04] or get larger uh which is a a beautiful
[19:07] concept that we have like a a fixed
[19:10] amount and gets lower over time uh which
[19:14] is not a problem because we can because
[19:16] there are actually people uh worrying
[19:19] about not having enough units for the
[19:21] whole world is like yeah we we can make
[19:23] out of one SATs if we really want to 100
[19:26] micro SATs or like a thousand motos or
[19:29] whatever uh so we can do that so there
[19:31] another a problem um one thing I'm
[19:34] curious about with with all the altcoins
[19:36] do you think they will all vanish I mean
[19:39] I only focus on bitcoin I I don't care
[19:41] about the altcoins um but it seems to be
[19:45] like already a long time around way
[19:48] longer than I expected I thought they
[19:50] are soon gone um is there a a small
[19:54] market for them is this like a gamble
[19:56] Market or will it be more like the
[19:58] bubble where the at some point it's just
[20:01] like one winner and all of the other
[20:03] ones are
[20:05] bursting this just my opinion I think
[20:07] there's going to be many second layers
[20:09] thousands of them I mean just like going
[20:11] into a place to gamble in Vegas you know
[20:14] you get these chips right that's that's
[20:16] effectively second layer so yeah there's
[20:19] going to be thousands of second layers
[20:21] and uh you know that's but there's only
[20:25] going to be really one standard
[20:27] measurement of value eventually
[20:29] um just as the US dollar is really the
[20:32] only standard measurement of value right
[20:34] now you know in the world that's going
[20:36] to change over time because they cannot
[20:40] stop debasing the US dollar debasement
[20:44] is going down by half every four
[20:48] years it's really the quality of money
[20:50] is not really about who
[20:53] can let's say burn tokens and make
[20:56] theirs more valuable it it's it's about
[21:00] again business being able to set up
[21:03] long-term contracts you don't want it to
[21:04] go you don't want it to inflate too much
[21:07] you don't want it to debase Too Much
[21:09] ideally ideal money is it doesn't debase
[21:13] or inflate but John Nash he is actually
[21:15] he lean he personally leaned toward
[21:17] something that gained in value to
[21:20] incentivize savings and th Thrift as he
[21:23] wrote and lectured on and so it's it's
[21:27] it's really your your body like like uh
[21:29] you know one of my favorite uh writers
[21:32] um Jeff Booth talks about the price of
[21:34] tomorrow and he talks about technology
[21:36] and how it's
[21:38] deflationary um and deflation is a good
[21:40] thing uh means modery prices go down
[21:43] it's good for the wage owner it's good
[21:45] for um you
[21:47] know the people who save and so on um I
[21:51] lean towards that John Nash leans
[21:53] towards that but the people that don't
[21:54] lean towards that are the banks you know
[21:57] um the uh
[21:59] the deficit spending governments the
[22:03] authoritarians in the world the tyrants
[22:05] that want to be able to print money
[22:07] those are the people that want want some
[22:09] kind of inflation and this say this
[22:13] arbitrary 2% we want 2% as a Target
[22:16] that's ridiculous why is that a Target
[22:19] the ideal money is zero
[22:22] inflation there should be no 2% Target
[22:25] ever it's it's it's inexcusable
[22:29] and and so this 2% theft uh by the by
[22:34] it's really not the central banks it's
[22:35] it's the shareholders of the fed and
[22:37] other central banks you know we're
[22:39] talking about Bank America Wells Fargo
[22:41] um I I believe there's a foreign Bank in
[22:43] there also who who's a shareholder of
[22:46] the fed this is this is a private
[22:48] organization that benefits from money
[22:50] printing it protects their their um
[22:55] loans that they've made and uh so this
[22:58] is this this is their profit and yet we
[23:00] tax income tax people that are
[23:03] productive I just don't get it you know
[23:05] we've turned the world upside down where
[23:07] we need to everyone needs to have a loan
[23:08] to get ahead on on some type of hard
[23:11] asset like a mortgage you know and so
[23:15] the banks can do well and you you know
[23:19] we don't need to live in that kind of
[23:20] world anymore uh there's really Bitcoin
[23:25] is shining a light and terms of
[23:28] providing
[23:29] contrast as to what ideal money should
[23:32] be and like Jeff Bo says as as
[23:35] technology starts to accelerate and it
[23:37] will will accelerate things will get
[23:39] more efficient um uh computers will
[23:43] become smarter than humans eventually uh
[23:46] then as as technology really reduces the
[23:50] cost
[23:52] of all kinds of Commodities and services
[23:57] people are going to ask
[23:59] why are prices going up why you know if
[24:02] if technolog is bringing the cost of
[24:05] Commodities and services down why do the
[24:08] prices keep on going up and it's because
[24:12] of bad money it's broken money that's
[24:16] bitcoiners understand that no big deal
[24:18] right but the general you know no
[24:20] coiners you know the the normies out
[24:23] there are quickly learning especially in
[24:26] places like Canada where the prices are
[24:27] are going quickly Euro U other other
[24:31] places where Fiat is failing these these
[24:33] Fiat Maxis are going down like dominoes
[24:37] you know uh we're gonna we're going to
[24:39] get a bitcoiner prime minister in Canada
[24:42] probably in
[24:44] 2025 because these Fiat Maxis are
[24:47] they're they don't you know people are
[24:49] learning inflation hurts yeah and it's
[24:52] uh that 2% inflation as you mentioned
[24:54] Jeff poof it's really interesting
[24:55] because they're not even stealing 2%
[24:57] they're stealing the 8% or like 5%
[25:00] whatever we we have there so uh 2% is
[25:04] kind of a a sneaky Target where the
[25:06] general population doesn't even
[25:08] recognize it really uh because it's not
[25:10] that bad like it's it's it's not that
[25:12] recognizable but it's still it's really
[25:15] bad if you actually look at that but
[25:17] most people don't realize that um do you
[25:20] think there's a chance that Federal
[25:22] Reserve especially now maybe with with
[25:24] Trum BS in office is seeing Bitcoin as
[25:27] an ass that they have to buy uh to
[25:30] preserve their uh their power a little
[25:34] bit
[25:35] longer um you know I don't know I I
[25:38] think the FED is growing increasingly
[25:40] irrelevant uh as Bitcoin gains in in U
[25:45] let's say uh in the psyche or psychology
[25:49] of the general populace they're starting
[25:51] to understand what Bitcoin is and and
[25:54] what what it what kind of value it
[25:56] brings to to the world and in terms of
[25:59] you know being able to save your energy
[26:02] your time um and the US dollar isn't
[26:06] doing that and and so the FED as as
[26:10] people start to move their Investments
[26:12] and savings into Bitcoin as opposed to
[26:14] the US dollar uh the FED is going to
[26:17] grow increasingly irrelevant and uh
[26:20] regardless of whether they start
[26:21] stacking SATs or not
[26:25] uh they're going to continue to grow IR
[26:28] relevant I I am a big supporter of SBR
[26:30] the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve not only
[26:33] for us but every nation for you know for
[26:37] every corporation for every family for
[26:39] every person uh we need to do our own
[26:42] personal strategic Bitcoin Reserve to
[26:45] save for the future um otherwise if
[26:49] you're you're investing in US Dollars
[26:52] you're going to you're subject to the US
[26:54] Treasury the US Congress and the Fed of
[26:59] working in coordinating the debasement
[27:01] of the US dollar it all starts with
[27:03] deficit spending and these these us
[27:07] treasuries they you know they issue them
[27:09] and then what do they do they when they
[27:12] roll them over they print money to roll
[27:14] them over so that's how they they bring
[27:16] you know more units into the system and
[27:19] they just keep doing that at an
[27:20] accelerated rate now and that nothing's
[27:22] going to stop that that Trend do do you
[27:27] do you think that this year might be a a
[27:30] major adoption year because we are at
[27:32] the right time of the of the Bitcoin
[27:34] cycle and there is talk of I do you know
[27:38] I've been in this this game since 2017
[27:41] and I aped in and uh you know I've I've
[27:46] never you know I've never lost faith in
[27:49] what it is because I I think I
[27:51] fundamentally understood what Bitcoin
[27:53] was uh I think it's really important to
[27:56] study Bitcoin um more than buying
[27:59] Bitcoin uh but once you understand it uh
[28:04] what is it going to happen this time you
[28:06] know you asked Robin uh what's going to
[28:09] happen this time is that your question
[28:12] oh yeah absolutely like what do you
[28:13] think happens uh this time because I
[28:17] think we are the the the best year when
[28:20] we take the side four year Cycle Theory
[28:23] we had like a really good year for for
[28:24] Bitcoin
[28:25] and5 uh one year after the har and um we
[28:30] have corporations in now we have uh
[28:34] nations with uh since 91 with El salador
[28:37] in and now this uh America is talking
[28:40] about a strategic Bitcoin Reserve which
[28:43] is completely crazy for me that they
[28:44] doing that so early um so in my mind I
[28:49] always imagine Bitcoin having like a
[28:51] huge Catalyst event or year or a short
[28:54] time frame and I'm just thinking of like
[28:58] 2025 could could that year be yeah and
[29:02] you know I was kind of doing a little
[29:03] dancer and the reason why is I don't
[29:05] really like talking about price I want
[29:06] to talk about you know the the
[29:09] background of of Bitcoin and John Nash
[29:11] and you know how it came to be um but
[29:14] let me let me just jump in both feet uh
[29:16] I I think 2025 is going to be one of the
[29:18] most amazing years for Bitcoin ever and
[29:21] I'm I'm partial I I think we're going to
[29:24] I think it's going to go up to you know
[29:26] maybe up to a million dollars per coin
[29:28] in 2025 and then it's probably going to
[29:30] crash back to 500,000 in
[29:34] 2026 um I I think in 2025 uh or or
[29:38] somewhere in between if somewhere
[29:40] between 200,000 to to a million uh
[29:42] that's where it's going to probably top
[29:44] out and then crash out and build some
[29:47] kind of equilibrium around 500,000 after
[29:49] that but you know I could be wrong it
[29:51] could be double that or it could be half
[29:53] that uh I don't know um but that's what
[29:57] I'm thinking because I the reason why I
[30:00] feel that way and it is just a feeling I
[30:02] mean we're talking about probabilities
[30:04] here uh it's because game theory is
[30:08] really kicking in between corporations
[30:09] between nations between uh you know it's
[30:13] not really retail it's really the big
[30:14] corporations and and the bond markets
[30:16] are you know they've they've been losing
[30:18] on bonds for three years
[30:20] now and uh you know micro strategy is
[30:24] providing a way out you know by having
[30:27] these these conver bonds and uh so yeah
[30:30] I think that's going to be the
[30:31] accelerating Trend not only for micro
[30:33] strategy but for other corporations that
[30:36] are trying to find a way out of the
[30:38] melting dollar I partnered up with coin
[30:42] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[30:45] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[30:47] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[30:50] love it so much coin vigilante made a
[30:53] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[30:56] subtle elent way to go out there and
[30:59] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[31:02] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[31:05] vilante just dropped a completely new
[31:08] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[31:11] watch collections you have the date of
[31:14] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[31:17] there and of course also the block
[31:19] height and which EPO we are currently in
[31:23] I love the level of detail they put in
[31:25] in this masterpiece and make make sure
[31:28] to check out those amazing coin vilante
[31:31] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[31:33] love those watches so so much if you
[31:37] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:39] regular basis I'll guess you already
[31:41] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[31:44] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[31:47] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[31:49] personal recommendation for Hardware
[31:51] wallet is the bit box it's super secure
[31:54] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[31:56] gift for a friend who has still the
[31:58] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[32:01] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[32:04] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[32:09] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[32:11] to really level up your sovereignty as
[32:14] an individual you have to have the most
[32:16] secure self custody setup you have to
[32:19] secure your own devices you have to
[32:22] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:25] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:27] where you live you even want to have a
[32:30] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:32] in case something goes really really
[32:34] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:36] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:39] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[32:42] way.com
[32:43] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[32:46] minute free call to find out how you can
[32:49] level up your sovereignty yeah it's kind
[32:52] of the the career risk is kind of
[32:55] flippening uh of like uh uh it was a big
[32:59] career risk to mention Bitcoin and to
[33:01] embrace Bitcoin in a company or in a
[33:03] nation or a politician position and
[33:06] slowly this thing is Shifting we like oh
[33:09] like you're CFO and you have no Bitcoin
[33:11] strategy like we not quite there yet but
[33:14] I feel like we we could enter um uh
[33:18] rather soon a period of like wait like
[33:20] you have shareholders and you don't even
[33:23] think about Bitcoin or you have uh not
[33:26] even a Bitcoin strategy uh that career
[33:28] RK could kind of flip and it's really
[33:30] hard to deny the the the the great
[33:35] properties that Bitcoin can bring to a
[33:37] company to a nation to a family to a
[33:40] trust to
[33:41] whatever yeah I you know I I I've kind
[33:44] of given up on orange killing people
[33:46] just because you don't know where those
[33:47] people really are at and yeah I I love I
[33:52] love Bitcoin and and macroeconomics and
[33:56] Game Theory and how these things
[33:57] interrelate with each other I've written
[33:59] three books on the topic but that
[34:01] doesn't mean that I enjoy orange pilling
[34:03] people you just don't know where people
[34:05] are at and and I'm I'll have the
[34:07] conversation but let's say talking on
[34:10] the retail side of things uh where
[34:13] somebody's just starting their journey
[34:14] and even though they've read one of my
[34:16] books and they want to talk about in
[34:18] Greater detail I I find that it's hard
[34:21] for me to to go back in time and talk
[34:26] about some of these these elements that
[34:29] most bitcoiners just simply simply
[34:31] understand now and uh so orange orange
[34:34] ping you know one person at a time I
[34:36] think it takes a lot of patience and I I
[34:37] just have to hand it to people that have
[34:39] that patience it's great absolutely it's
[34:43] it's hard sometimes um but yeah I I
[34:46] switched to a defensive Orange Building
[34:48] strategy where if someone comes to me
[34:51] and ask me about Bitcoin then I take my
[34:54] time and explain them what it is um but
[34:57] I completely stopped uh actively or ping
[35:01] people and actively talking to bitcoin
[35:04] that that's mostly a waste of time for
[35:07] me um what I do I got invited to um a
[35:11] small gold uh meet up uh conference with
[35:15] like a 100 people in Austria and they
[35:17] asked me to talk about Bitcoin because
[35:19] they want to explore Bitcoin as a new
[35:21] IDE and maybe exploring it as for the
[35:24] small community that they have and I was
[35:25] like ah of course I I like to do talk to
[35:28] Gold bucks about Bitcoin that that seems
[35:30] to be a good use of my time and probably
[35:32] also fun but yeah that uh outside of
[35:35] that I don't do a lot of Orange Building
[35:37] um you also I canot in the email that
[35:41] you sent to me I think you also
[35:42] mentioned some parallels that you see
[35:44] between John Nash and S Nakamoto uh if
[35:48] if I'm correct uh what do you what do
[35:51] you see there what did you highlight
[35:53] there yeah I got I wrote 18 connections
[35:56] and there's a lot more than that but but
[35:58] these are the ones that I just kind of
[35:59] went through and and thought were you
[36:03] know some of the the strong connections
[36:05] between Satoshi dmoto and John
[36:08] Nash and so the the book is really a
[36:10] biography you know Bitcoin and Nash
[36:12] equilibrium is really a biography about
[36:15] John Nash and so I cover his his history
[36:18] and then halfway through the book I I
[36:19] jump into these 18 connections that I
[36:22] call you know 18 signature uh attributes
[36:26] attributes between ntion
[36:29] Nakamoto and uh and we've already
[36:31] covered one of them you know the
[36:32] asymptotically ideal money but uh
[36:35] gradually phased uh this is something
[36:38] that that Nash and and Nakamoto both
[36:42] talked about there was a time you know
[36:45] when you know we remember the phrase
[36:47] Kick The Hornet's Nest you know I mean
[36:49] this this guy he was paranoid of some
[36:53] type of central organization coming at
[36:55] him and by the way John Nash was he had
[36:58] fear that uh you
[36:59] know of of federal agents were following
[37:04] him and so on during his illness right
[37:07] um so here's a here's a Satoshi Nakamoto
[37:10] that was paranoid about that and he
[37:13] didn't want Wikileaks to to really start
[37:15] using Bitcoin because it wasn't ready
[37:18] and he he really talked about
[37:21] um Bitcoin wasn't ready for that and
[37:24] that we had to gradually when it was
[37:27] stronger well that's a strong parallel
[37:29] that's a connection so I threw that in
[37:31] there as as number two number three
[37:33] Central uh bank bailouts and Grand
[37:38] Partners uh
[37:40] Satoshi you know he put that in the
[37:43] first Genesis block central bank
[37:46] bailouts and during uh John Nash when he
[37:50] talked in ideal money and asymptotically
[37:53] ideal money he talked about the grand
[37:56] partners and these are people that you
[37:59] know forgive debts so they they really
[38:03] centralize power and uh you know this is
[38:06] something that the bank of England was
[38:08] doing back in the 1700s and Marx studied
[38:12] in England and you know he wrote uh that
[38:16] the for Marxism for communism to work
[38:19] you you've got to have a nationalized
[38:21] bank bank that controls the credit so uh
[38:26] this is really one of the cornerstones
[38:28] of modern day authoritarianism and
[38:31] totalitarianism is you know the central
[38:33] banks and uh the bailouts and the
[38:35] pardoning that's going on so these are
[38:37] these are two attributes or that's a
[38:40] connection between Nash and Nakamoto
[38:42] where both of them had very strong
[38:43] feelings about that uh number four
[38:46] obviously both of them were great
[38:49] mathematicians uh number five clearly
[38:52] they understood economists in in in in
[38:55] essential way they didn't get into into
[38:57] complicated things like coalitions like
[38:59] Bon noan coalitions or or um you know
[39:04] smart contracts or other features or
[39:07] whistles and bells they kept it simple
[39:10] and that really hearkens towards
[39:12] individual
[39:14] sovereignty um and what other organ
[39:17] associations people choose through this
[39:20] Austrian way of looking at things of how
[39:22] people you know what do they value um so
[39:26] I think that's a strong
[39:28] connection
[39:30] uh both of them were obviously amazing
[39:34] cryptographers uh even when during his
[39:37] illness John Nash during his his illness
[39:39] he would be up on the chalkboards and
[39:41] and doing these prime numbers oh what
[39:44] what is it called um when
[39:46] you're they use it for cryptography but
[39:49] you're you're going through and
[39:52] you're factoring prime numbers he would
[39:54] do these to the nth degree I mean people
[39:57] would just look at at his work and he'
[39:59] do it on paper too and they're just
[40:01] going you know wow this guy's like a
[40:03] machine so that's something that was
[40:06] used as for
[40:08] cryptography um but later on elliptical
[40:11] elliptical curve cryptography came in
[40:15] and Satoshi naramoto used the elliptical
[40:18] uh ECC elliptical curve cryptography but
[40:22] Satoshi was also taking prime numbers
[40:24] and slipping them in as
[40:26] parameters in into the elliptical curve
[40:30] phography so yeah it's modern but it's
[40:32] also goes way back and he combines it
[40:34] into something that's even stronger so
[40:36] that's a strong
[40:37] connection um I think the longf needs
[40:39] for double digital double span solution
[40:42] longf need for decentralized majority
[40:45] decision- making that that's clearly a
[40:47] Nash Nakamoto connection very strong I
[40:50] got into a concept called aware of all
[40:52] transactions and that that kind of
[40:56] relates to the fix theorem fixo theorem
[41:01] and and uh you know the Nash equilibrium
[41:05] but really in that chapter or sub
[41:09] chapter I I really start talking about
[41:10] the utxo because the utxo is so elegant
[41:14] it's truly novel it's it's a innovation
[41:19] in Bitcoin and and so you know you look
[41:22] at how elegant that is it's like oh man
[41:24] that just that that that is so that it's
[41:28] this is the kind of John Nash work that
[41:30] he did you know in 1950 on his
[41:32] dissertation he he he he really was a
[41:36] lone genius and what he brought out of
[41:39] those times away his his peers
[41:43] recognized him as this guy's a genius in
[41:47] fact his recommendation going from
[41:50] Carnegie to Princeton two words or or
[41:53] just a sentence this guy's a genius got
[41:56] him in you know because of his work so
[41:59] yeah I think that the utxo is a is a
[42:01] strong connection um aware of all
[42:05] transactions yeah that's still a
[42:07] connection not a strong connection uh
[42:09] calm knowledgeable collaborative precise
[42:13] no arrogance this is something that what
[42:15] is Judge malor I can't remember his name
[42:18] described Satoshi Nakamoto in comparison
[42:21] to Craig Wright which was just the
[42:23] opposite of all those um and yet you
[42:26] people know John
[42:28] Nash that was him he he he wasn't
[42:32] arrogant um you know he was uh precise
[42:36] and concise and knowledgeable and he he
[42:38] was not arrogant he was a humble humble
[42:40] guy so those that's I I believe he a
[42:43] very strong connection uh the use of
[42:45] plural plur pronouns you know when when
[42:47] you read the white paper uh he he speaks
[42:50] in a plural way I I I believe that there
[42:52] was only one person involved in writing
[42:55] the code for Bitcoin because if it was a
[42:57] group there wouldn't be a secret about
[42:59] it you can't keep a secret with a group
[43:01] so I believe it was a lone genius A
[43:04] Beautiful Mind that that put it together
[43:06] and and if you look at um his papers
[43:10] back in 1950 and later he's always
[43:13] speaking in plural even though he was
[43:14] the only author so so the Bitcoin white
[43:17] paper and and his previous Publications
[43:21] they have that that plural connection I
[43:24] I believe that's a strong connection
[43:26] also um
[43:27] um definitely remnants of a paranoid
[43:30] secret world you know Satoshi working
[43:33] with pseudonyms and disappearing and all
[43:35] that that's a remnant of the secret
[43:37] world and John Nash still maintain you
[43:40] know he understood what
[43:42] was considered to be mentally ill but
[43:45] that doesn't mean it goes away it was
[43:47] still in him in terms of his fears his
[43:50] fears of centralized Powers you know
[43:53] people controlling or or you know so so
[43:57] when kicking the Hornet's Nest and
[43:59] Satoshi just disappears most people
[44:02] don't have those kind of fears but
[44:04] someone who's recovering from paranoid
[44:06] schizophrenia it's very plausible that
[44:08] they could have those kind of fears um
[44:12] the the the the last correspondence
[44:15] where he writes in
[44:18] 2014 that he's not Satoshi you know the
[44:21] Japanese guy who Newsweek claimed that
[44:25] this guy was Satoshi and all of a sudden
[44:27] his family was you know being harassed
[44:30] and he was being harassed he goes look
[44:32] I'm not I'm not so Toshi did one more
[44:34] message says you know I'm not this guy
[44:36] and that was his last public cor
[44:38] correspondence that we're aware of and
[44:41] John Nash died in 2015 in a horrible
[44:44] taxi accident coming home from another
[44:47] award that he award his wife was there
[44:49] they weren't wearing their seat belts
[44:50] they were both ejected both of them died
[44:52] in 2015 so that correlation of the last
[44:55] correspondence the fact that
[44:58] you know a hundred billion dollars of
[45:01] satoshi's um Bitcoin doesn't move so you
[45:06] know those I believe that's a strong his
[45:08] death in 2015 is just one more strong
[45:12] connection Cooperative solution for
[45:14] non-cooperative found Cooperative
[45:17] solution from non-cooperative
[45:19] foundations that's Bitcoin you know
[45:22] Bitcoin is going to
[45:23] bring much greater International Peace
[45:28] uh because we can build Cooperative
[45:30] relationships even though we we are
[45:33] competitors we will find our Cooperative
[45:37] Relationships by having a neutral
[45:40] money and um and him writing about that
[45:44] in
[45:45] 1950 uh John Nash and Adam Smith writing
[45:49] about it back in 1776 these things all
[45:51] tie together you know the law of supply
[45:53] and demand the Nash equilibrium and the
[45:56] emerging Bitcoin equilibrium which I
[45:59] coined that just because I was writing
[46:00] about Bitcoin and Nash equilibrium it's
[46:02] like let's just put in a second Title
[46:05] Here the emerging Bitcoin equilibrium
[46:06] that's where we're
[46:08] going and if if you look at those three
[46:11] um let's let's call them phenomenas you
[46:14] know the law of supply and demand the
[46:18] national equilibrium and what bitcoin's
[46:19] going to become there's parallel between
[46:22] all three very strong connection so I
[46:25] count that as a strong connection
[46:27] Classical liberalism and free market
[46:29] capitalism you know that that's really
[46:31] Hayek and uh and the other the other
[46:35] uh Austrian
[46:38] economists and uh so I I write about
[46:40] some of his connections and how he he
[46:43] shows respect towards these Austrian
[46:45] economics and and you know what I think
[46:47] is interesting is a lot of people think
[46:48] Bitcoin is libertarianism and that's
[46:51] political um that's a political thing
[46:53] it's Republican or whatever you know I I
[46:57] don't really see Bitcoin as being it can
[46:59] be can be political but I see it
[47:02] primarily as Austrian more so than
[47:06] libertarianism libertarianism is is is a
[47:09] politic Austrian economic economics is
[47:12] is economic theory right it's more like
[47:15] mathematics so I I see Bitcoin as being
[47:18] uh
[47:19] Austrian um and I also want to bring in
[47:24] a other signature attributes um I follow
[47:27] John goson for example and he's written
[47:29] many connections between Nash and
[47:31] Nakamoto and so I I write about some of
[47:34] his his connections or let's call him
[47:37] Nash Nakamoto signature
[47:40] attributes so those are all 18 I love
[47:42] that it almost seems like John Nas could
[47:45] have been zos Nakamoto yeah I think he
[47:47] was I'm I'm convinced he is I mean
[47:49] nobody has that many
[47:51] connections nobody has those 18 con
[47:53] connections how many people out there
[47:55] can say you know know if you say oh uh
[47:58] Elon Musk invented Bitcoin you know okay
[48:01] does he have a long-felt need for
[48:03] decentralized uh digital transactions
[48:05] does he have a long-felt need for having
[48:06] decentralized governance now this is the
[48:08] guy who centralizes power you know he
[48:10] buys his own media to so he has a bigger
[48:13] horn to have more influence for his
[48:16] centralized governance he didn't have a
[48:18] long felt need for decentralized
[48:22] governance John Nash did and he was
[48:25] actively pursuing that writing about
[48:26] about it uh and then that's written in
[48:29] the white paper you know those are the
[48:30] two innovations uh decentralized or or a
[48:35] peer-to-peer digital transaction without
[48:37] a third party that's one and then you
[48:39] know a decentralized money and then a
[48:42] decentralized governance that work
[48:43] together and you got to have both you
[48:45] can't just have one and that's why all
[48:46] these meme
[48:48] coins don't don't mess with them they're
[48:51] you're just throw your money out the
[48:53] window you you'll get you'll get it work
[48:55] done a lot faster
[48:57] absolutely I I I I do agree with that a
[49:00] lot uh my my shitcoin face uh luckily
[49:05] only uh lasted like half a year or year
[49:07] something like that and I'm very happy
[49:09] about that because a lot of people in my
[49:11] age especially uh like I say like 26 24
[49:16] 2018 they they're way more into cryptos
[49:19] than into this Bitcoin only thing it's
[49:23] almost seems to be like you have to be
[49:24] 30 and a little bit mature and a little
[49:27] bit um have experience in life to get
[49:31] why only Bitcoin makes sense and the
[49:33] other ones are speculation and and
[49:35] casino and don't even have a use case
[49:38] for that so uh I see that in my
[49:40] statistics even like I'm a young host
[49:43] and uh I have more I have three times
[49:46] more viewers above 65 than I have under
[49:50] 25 my age yeah you know these people who
[49:54] go after fast money you know they they
[49:56] either lose it or they end up in jail um
[49:59] I mean look at Roger ver where he's at
[50:01] now I mean this is a fast money kind of
[50:03] guy uh the the people that I I I think
[50:08] that gratefulness for what you have is a
[50:10] superpower and and if you can remind
[50:13] yourself to to be grateful for what you
[50:16] have um and really take the long-term
[50:19] view I'm trying to for your
[50:21] accomplishments uh you will be
[50:22] successful you you will you will get
[50:24] there but these these you know the
[50:26] shortterm term get rich things you know
[50:30] if you get like like this What's the
[50:32] phrase um if you get greedy you get
[50:35] slaughtered like a pig or you know the
[50:37] phrase I I I can't recall it quickly but
[50:40] yeah and it's also I mean there are so
[50:43] many studies done with a lottery rers
[50:46] and if you buy an altcoin that goes up
[50:50] like crazy that's kind of like winning a
[50:52] lottery uh and all those lottery winners
[50:55] end up being being in a worse financial
[50:58] position than they were before not all
[51:00] of them of course some of them make good
[51:01] decisions also with that money but most
[51:03] of them like throw a lot of money uh the
[51:08] person with the wrong mindset he will
[51:09] lose it all uh it doesn't get rugged
[51:13] fold you're G to get rugged and and that
[51:15] that that includes all the Fiats in the
[51:17] world too including the the US dollar
[51:19] you know I think the US dollar really is
[51:21] going to probably become second layer
[51:23] for Bitcoin eventually that's where I
[51:25] think it's going to end up
[51:27] but there's going to be a lot of rug
[51:28] pulling before it gets to that point
[51:31] multiple times I mean you're going to
[51:32] see some heavy devaluations of the US
[51:35] dollar because of because of our debt
[51:37] you know we're 36 trillion now growing
[51:39] 100 another trillion every 100 days and
[51:42] all the other Fiats in the world are
[51:44] well almost all of them are worse than
[51:46] the US dollar in terms of debasement
[51:48] it's just yeah rug pole after rug pole
[51:50] so you know mem coins
[51:54] Fiat uh you know it's all the same if
[51:58] they don't have decentralized
[52:00] governance it's all if you have
[52:02] centralized governance for for Fiat or
[52:04] crypto or meme coins it's all the same
[52:07] stuff you're going to get
[52:09] rugged interesting how do you
[52:13] think because we talking about history a
[52:16] little bit how do you think in like 500
[52:18] maybe a thousand years people will look
[52:20] back at satosi
[52:22] Nakamoto um and look back at his his his
[52:26] work I think he's going to go down in
[52:28] history as the prince of piece um and
[52:31] people won't fully understand that until
[52:33] they understand how good money is the
[52:36] root of all good and how bad money is
[52:38] the root of all evil
[52:40] truly uh what's interesting about that
[52:43] you know uh during during his illness he
[52:46] thought he was the Prince of Peace So
[52:48] sometimes when you're dreaming at night
[52:50] and you wake up your dreams are just
[52:52] crazy but sometimes they actually make
[52:54] sense I think this was one example in
[52:57] during his uh
[53:00] schizophrenia that he thought he was the
[53:02] Prince of Peace but it was his
[53:06] subconscious really speaking the truth
[53:09] um he will become the Prince of Peace
[53:11] eventually uh as people
[53:14] recognize that it was probably John Nash
[53:18] that was Satoshi Nakamoto I firmly
[53:20] believe he he's they're the same person
[53:23] Nakamoto and Nash are the same in my
[53:25] mind um and you don't have to believe
[53:28] that to if you study Nash regardless of
[53:31] whether you believe that or not you're
[53:33] going to understand the John Nash
[53:35] narrative which by the way you can copy
[53:37] and paste and apply to bitcoin so it's
[53:38] very valuable to to study Nash ideal
[53:41] money and asymptotically ideal money and
[53:43] his biography to understand Bitcoin but
[53:46] the point is is that yeah he he also s
[53:48] thought some other crazy stuff like he
[53:50] felt or he thought he was the ambassador
[53:54] of Antarctica you okay that's nutty I
[53:57] mean that's that's what we call
[53:58] schizophrenia why are people
[54:00] schizophrenic um he John Nash had some
[54:03] theories on this um he felt you know I I
[54:09] write about some of the stressors that
[54:10] were in John Nash's life and when life
[54:14] what Nash said is when life is not
[54:17] good you your mind will take you
[54:20] somewhere else and it's it's an Escape
[54:23] schizophrenia for John Nash it was an
[54:25] escape from
[54:26] some challenges that he was having in
[54:28] his life and uh and it was actually from
[54:32] other readings that I've read is that
[54:35] schizophrenia can be not a bad thing but
[54:39] actually quite euphoric um I I I think
[54:41] that's interesting so he really kind of
[54:44] suffered from 25 years of of delusion or
[54:49] perhaps Euphoria you are you there I
[54:51] don't hear you again can you hear me oh
[54:54] no now I hear you again sorry I think
[54:56] get cut out for like a second or
[54:57] something like that but that's super
[54:59] last was I think John Nash suffered you
[55:03] know 25 years of delusion or you could
[55:06] say Euphoria do you think history will
[55:10] recognize CH Nash as s Nakamoto at some
[55:13] point or let's phrase it different like
[55:15] what has to happen that they like if
[55:19] that's true that John Nash is s Nakamoto
[55:22] uh then they're dead like he's dead and
[55:25] there like it's hard to proof um or is
[55:28] it even important that the that he is
[55:30] recognized as as him I don't think it's
[55:32] important that he is recognized as the
[55:34] prince of pece but I think he will be uh
[55:37] I I think it's important to study his
[55:39] biography and his
[55:41] contributions to economics which are
[55:45] amazing uh I think understanding uh
[55:48] Nash Nash equilibrium uh non-cooperative
[55:52] games uh in comparison to van noyman and
[55:55] and why deserves the Nobel Prize clearly
[55:59] that will will give you a clean
[56:00] narrative as to why very simple Bitcoin
[56:05] is doing well and will continue to do
[56:08] well so is he going to be recognized for
[56:11] being being the Prince of Peace as he
[56:13] thought he
[56:15] was during his 25 years he there was a
[56:18] period where he thought he was the
[56:19] Prince of Peace just but there's also
[56:22] the idea that he thought he was the
[56:23] ambassador of Antarctica okay so so like
[56:26] I said uh in your dreams when you wake
[56:28] up you you may have a Nutty dream but
[56:31] sometimes your subconscious creates
[56:33] things that are you know quite
[56:35] insightful uh so that's what he was
[56:38] dealing with is I think he will be
[56:41] recognized as the Prince of Peace as
[56:43] good money is the root of all good and
[56:47] bad money is the root of all evil uh
[56:51] it's you get both sides depending on if
[56:54] if it's good money or bad money and
[56:55] usually people are having to deal with
[56:57] bad money controlled by authoritarians
[57:00] tyrants and this has been going on for a
[57:02] long time so people associate bad money
[57:05] with the root of evil uh you know even
[57:07] the Romans were debasing their coinage
[57:09] and it threw Humanity into a very long
[57:13] Dark Age the Dark Ages right and we came
[57:16] out of it because we had good money the
[57:18] Florin was printing you know in Italy
[57:20] they planted the gold Floren without
[57:22] debasing it and that established all
[57:25] these networks in nor Africa and across
[57:27] Europe and we had this Renaissance and
[57:30] Bitcoin is going to generate that
[57:32] Renaissance not just for the country
[57:35] that adopts the spr first but it's going
[57:39] to build these International networks
[57:41] that uh really allow supply chain to
[57:44] optimize uh you know Commodities to
[57:48] levels that we've never seen before
[57:51] that's fascinating I also love the
[57:52] connection between Shan Nash and SOS
[57:55] Nakamoto I honestly never heard about
[57:57] John Nash till till today I will
[58:00] definitely go down Rabbit Hole from here
[58:02] on I think that's really interesting and
[58:05] uh did I forget to ask anything is there
[58:09] anything that you would like to add as
[58:11] we are closing down on the one hour mark
[58:13] is there anything that you it's really
[58:15] important uh about John Nash or the the
[58:19] uh about his work to to say here before
[58:21] we end
[58:22] up yeah I I I think I'd like to cover
[58:25] just four things and and this is you
[58:28] know what is the price what is the price
[58:30] for the Bitcoin equilibrium now it's not
[58:33] just a matter of you know number goes up
[58:37] but eventually we're going to get to an
[58:39] equilibrium and things will start to
[58:40] stabilize and we'll have a standard
[58:42] measurement of value for almost all
[58:44] things um so what what what what is the
[58:47] price from that Nash equilibrium what is
[58:49] the price from a Bitcoin equilibrium and
[58:53] that's where I believe we're going to
[58:54] get rid of Insidious inflation uh that's
[58:57] going to benefit the wage earner I call
[58:59] it EXA actually um you know
[59:03] um saving savings Thrift
[59:07] earnings um conservation will be
[59:11] rewarded in the future and your
[59:13] Investments won't be debased you know um
[59:16] another thing is
[59:19] is the velocity of value is going to
[59:23] accelerate like we've never experienced
[59:25] before
[59:27] uh we could do International
[59:30] transactions at one
[59:32] time by how you moved gold or perhaps
[59:36] how you moved the the second layer you
[59:38] know
[59:40] paper you know let's call it the paper
[59:42] layer for lack of
[59:44] vocabulary um but
[59:46] then the velocity of value is going to
[59:50] increase at the speed of light in the
[59:53] future faster than we can we can can do
[59:56] it with artificial intelligence and
[59:59] Bitcoin where you can do digital
[60:02] transactions without a third party um
[60:05] which as you know that third part is
[60:07] very expensive uh they love to talk
[60:10] about 2% but we all know it's much
[60:12] higher than that they're stealing from
[60:14] each transaction so the velocity of
[60:16] value is going to go up and the
[60:19] abundance that will come from that is
[60:22] not comprehensible to you me or anyone
[60:25] that's listening to this now so we have
[60:27] a very you know Renaissance 2.0 is going
[60:32] to is is incomprehensible to us so we
[60:35] have a future that's very bright another
[60:38] thing uh from that you're going to get
[60:40] an international pieace dividend when
[60:43] you can have non-cooperative games with
[60:45] a neutral money you're going to find
[60:48] cooperation and those cooperations will
[60:50] build and evolve and mature and and you
[60:53] know auxify or
[60:56] um aify excuse me uh so so peace will
[61:00] come from that and uh last thing I want
[61:02] to say is the cost of living is going to
[61:05] go way way down I mean this is Jeff
[61:07] Booth and his book about the the price
[61:11] of tomorrow you know I was I was having
[61:13] dinner with some people that were I was
[61:15] at a at a
[61:18] club in Seattle and uh you know they're
[61:23] let's call them the financial class and
[61:25] I just asked everyone at the table I
[61:27] said is it good when prices go up or go
[61:29] down and all three of them said when
[61:31] prices go up it's good you know and here
[61:34] I am an engineer and I'm thinking you
[61:36] know I'm I'm doing
[61:37] everything throughout my entire career
[61:40] to try to bring down the cost of things
[61:42] trying to make things more efficient and
[61:45] we got these you know financial advisers
[61:47] and people that own a lot of assets
[61:51] think that it's good when prices go up
[61:53] so when the price of Commodities go down
[61:57] which you know Adam Smith talked about
[61:58] The Wealth of Nations is really having
[62:00] access to lowcost Commodities you know
[62:03] corn lowcost corn compared to Europe uh
[62:07] gives us the United States uh an
[62:10] advantage in terms of The Wealth of
[62:12] Nations and you know we've we've been
[62:13] seeing houses go up up up up up and it's
[62:16] been going on even longer over in the UK
[62:19] and so now the next generation is priced
[62:21] out so yeah the older generation stole
[62:26] from the future and it may have been
[62:29] good at party when they did it but that
[62:32] part is over and so in the long run the
[62:36] price you know the cost of living
[62:38] decreasing because of Bitcoin because of
[62:41] a uh B Bitcoin equilibrium because the
[62:46] standard measurement of values can can
[62:48] be compared and transactions can be do
[62:50] with a greater and greater velocity that
[62:53] cost of living is going to be going down
[62:55] for everyone
[62:56] and that's a good thing that's my
[62:58] opinion it's a very good
[63:01] thing that's fascinating Jeff Bo work is
[63:04] amazing he's he was I think the the
[63:07] first bigger guest that I had on my show
[63:09] like even almost a year ago now uh and
[63:13] yeah Jeff p is is always an amazing
[63:16] thinker and and great to to hear him
[63:18] talk a lot to listen to him I think it's
[63:22] it's great what he's doing a great
[63:24] writer great uh speaker um really cool
[63:28] we are coming to the end of the podcast
[63:30] and I asked each and every one of my
[63:32] guests one question which is what can we
[63:35] learn from you besides
[63:39] Bitcoin oh what I'm working on right now
[63:42] is um I'm working on what I'd call a
[63:45] distributed State machine and it's of
[63:47] course I've been inspired by Nakamoto in
[63:51] many ways but it's really
[63:54] about I I I I've been an aerospace
[63:57] engineer for a long time and I'm very
[64:00] interested in making a distributed State
[64:04] machine or or let's call it a a
[64:06] decentralized PLM product life cycle
[64:08] management where you can take these
[64:11] traditionally very expensive engineering
[64:13] tools and just make them available to
[64:16] Engineers around the world and you know
[64:19] I think one to five years I think I can
[64:21] do that um so that's something I really
[64:23] enjoy working on uh in terms of of high
[64:26] you have to you have to set up an
[64:28] architecture that's highly
[64:30] interoperable uh using uh you know Open
[64:33] Standards for the for the cad for the 3D
[64:36] for the 2D uh and
[64:40] uh and I think the the private public
[64:42] key is going to create some opportunity
[64:45] in that area so that's something I enjoy
[64:46] working on and I hope to hope that will
[64:49] be a one of my contributions in the
[64:51] future oh I love to see that really
[64:53] really cool um we have ENT in the
[64:56] podcast where the previous guest is
[64:57] asking a question for the next guest
[64:59] without knowing who the next guest
[65:00] actually is and the question from the
[65:02] previous guest for you is how do you
[65:05] feel about donating satoshis to uh Ross
[65:09] alri to get him started in life when he
[65:12] hopefully gets baded uh soon I think
[65:16] that'd be great I think even better um
[65:18] you know president-elect Trump should
[65:21] return like 5% of that money back to him
[65:24] uh to to get him started and uh you know
[65:27] not only he should give some of those
[65:29] Bitcoin back to to Ross I mean yeah it
[65:33] was elicit trade or uh exchange not
[65:36] trade um but you know his
[65:41] accomplishments for a young man doing
[65:44] such a large
[65:46] exchange it should be
[65:48] noted that's an interesting one I think
[65:51] Donald Trump would benefit from that
[65:54] also like he has an in incentive to do
[65:56] that it's uh I always like to think of
[65:59] incentives why someone should do that uh
[66:02] for for himself also and I think uh it
[66:05] would be obviously an amazing move and
[66:07] it would be extremely fair to Ross
[66:09] albri but it would also benefit Donald
[66:13] Trump a lot because at at and not at
[66:15] this point we all expect him to do uh
[66:19] the B him and and and it will it will
[66:21] happen but when he does more than we
[66:24] expect from him I think that would
[66:25] benefit him also a lot so maybe it
[66:28] happens I don't know I think it should
[66:30] be done because the way Ross was treated
[66:33] that was definitely an overreach uh so
[66:37] it would be due compensation for for
[66:40] being in prison for so long for a
[66:43] non-violent crime you know it just
[66:44] doesn't make sense 100% agreed really
[66:47] cool thank you so much uh Brian for for
[66:50] being on the show and and being part of
[66:53] it um before I let you go where can be
[66:55] find you ask you questions and reach out
[66:57] to you yeah go to sst.com S Sol sn.com
[67:02] uh and then click on John Nash and you
[67:04] can
[67:05] find uh the book it links out to Amazon
[67:08] but what I've done one of my readers
[67:10] says you know I can't follow these links
[67:12] that I have a lot of citations that go
[67:14] over to the Princeton Princeton math
[67:17] department archive that have all of
[67:20] these John Nath John Nash uh documents
[67:25] and so I have about 70 footnotes and a
[67:28] lot of these you can directly link but
[67:31] the links were so long that they
[67:33] couldn't type them in so I just wrote
[67:35] All 70 of them there yeah I don't have
[67:37] live links that go into a beautiful mind
[67:39] but the live links that go into the
[67:42] Princeton math department you can read
[67:44] the book and follow the links and then
[67:45] you can read in context where these
[67:47] quotes are coming from and that context
[67:50] is is valuable for really understanding
[67:53] the spirit of John Nash
[67:56] really cool thank you so much uh for
[67:58] that also thank you so much for everyone
[68:00] that is watching and listening uh for
[68:02] joining us today as always I'll be back
