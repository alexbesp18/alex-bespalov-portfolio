[00:00] Bitcoin is truth. It's open source.
[00:01] There is no no central authority. There
[00:04] is no CEO. There is no marketing
[00:05] department within BDC Prague. Be it on
[00:08] stage or in the in the expo. There is no
[00:11] no promotion of uh of what we call
[00:13] shitcoins. Uh so it's that that is the
[00:16] the ethos very much. My girlfriend
[00:19] sometimes just jokingly says when I'm
[00:22] was saying something about bitcoin, she
[00:23] she she says something like blessed are
[00:25] the are the believers. Like that was
[00:28] kind of the the cognitive dissonance
[00:29] that I thought, okay, didn't I just swap
[00:31] one one utopia for the other, you know,
[00:33] because it's also hoping for a new
[00:35] system. And that that's really how in in
[00:37] this Jehovah's Witnesses religion,
[00:39] everything is done with the hope of a
[00:41] new world after God destroys the this
[00:44] bad world in in Armageddon and only the
[00:46] the ones that are that were faithful
[00:48] will survive.
[00:51] [Music]
[00:53] give us some some background of uh what
[00:56] are you doing and and and who you are.
[00:58] Yeah, my name is Michael. I'm the
[01:00] marketing manager for BDC Prague. Uh I
[01:03] joined just about 3 or 4 months before
[01:06] last year's event, before the 2024
[01:08] event. Um so that was uh yeah was quite
[01:11] busy of course just getting uh getting
[01:13] into it and uh yeah very very successful
[01:16] event and since then uh yeah joined the
[01:19] team on a more or less permanent basis
[01:22] and and working on the the 25 edition
[01:25] very hard right now. Really cool and uh
[01:28] the book got released uh uh what was the
[01:32] uh the title? It's a long title. It's
[01:35] from defenestrations to Bitcoin. a 600y
[01:37] year fight for for freedom. It's uh it's
[01:40] yeah an ebook that we we worked on for
[01:43] quite some time and uh it's it's about
[01:46] the uh the history of the the Czech
[01:50] Freedom Fight. I'm not from the Czech
[01:51] Czech Republic myself, but I remember I
[01:53] was at BDC Prague myself in in 23 during
[01:56] the first edition uh where I was still
[01:57] working with with another company. I
[01:59] think they had some some kind of banner
[02:01] outside with this entire timeline and
[02:04] maybe also on the on the video screen
[02:06] some kind of animation. Um, so I was
[02:08] kind of tangentially aware of it. Uh, I
[02:11] knew that that uh General Bites was from
[02:14] Prague, Satoshi was from from Prague.
[02:17] But, uh, this this whole history is is
[02:20] actually pretty fascinating. It goes
[02:22] back all the way to the to the 15th
[02:23] century when the the the the people of
[02:26] those lands uh uh yeah basically threw
[02:31] uh tyrannical leaders from uh from from
[02:34] from the town hall u to uh to to stop
[02:38] the the the over overreach and that kind
[02:41] of events u uh repeated themselves a few
[02:44] few times throughout the history and
[02:46] then you have the more recent history
[02:48] during uh the the communist era and the
[02:52] um the the the um the velvet velvet
[02:56] revolution and um I mean all that all
[02:59] that history has has influenced
[03:01] obviously people's nature and especially
[03:03] I think the the more recent uh communist
[03:06] era uh turned many people into trade
[03:10] tradesmen uh because a lot of stuff was
[03:12] not available in in shops. So someone
[03:15] was a carpenter and could trade
[03:17] something they made for clothing or
[03:20] other things that other people made. And
[03:22] that's kind of as as far as I learned
[03:24] and as far as uh I I understood is is
[03:26] part of very much part of the culture
[03:28] making making stuff yourself. And that's
[03:31] very much also present in the the
[03:34] current Bitcoin ecosystem with Satoshi
[03:37] Labs and and other uh other companies
[03:39] coming coming from Bitcoin related
[03:41] companies coming from Prague. uh very
[03:43] big uh yeah cipher cipher punk ethos and
[03:47] and um and and culture pres present
[03:50] there. So the goal with this ebook was
[03:52] to to kind of describe this entire
[03:54] history and it's a really nicely
[03:56] illustrated kind of coffee table book
[03:58] that you can can browse and just learn
[04:00] about that about that history and it's
[04:03] uh it's available as a as a free
[04:04] download. So uh people can just go to
[04:07] the top of our our X or Twitter timeline
[04:10] where it's uh where where it's pinned.
[04:12] So, that's uh that's something we we've
[04:13] been working on and we're still thinking
[04:16] about it's not entirely sure, but we're
[04:17] still thinking about uh possibly uh
[04:20] doing some some limited print run to
[04:22] make physical make physical copies. It's
[04:25] it's a nice nice giveaway and uh we're
[04:28] still thinking about that. But it's uh
[04:30] it was fascinating to to dive into that
[04:32] just the whole concept uh creating the
[04:35] whole book and diving into that history
[04:37] getting everything fact checked and uh
[04:39] learning about that myself and uh it's
[04:42] it's really inspiring. It's what I what
[04:43] I took away from the first BDC Prague
[04:46] event when I was there just experiencing
[04:48] experiencing that whole culture
[04:51] um was was really interesting and and I
[04:53] I wasn't expecting that. So that that's
[04:56] also for me when I talk about BDCR.
[04:58] Okay, obviously I'm working with them
[05:00] now, but back then I was still with
[05:01] another company and that was really
[05:04] inspiring and that that's something that
[05:06] yeah, I always recommend people like go
[05:08] go to Prague and just experience it
[05:09] yourself. It's it's really interesting
[05:11] ecosystem. Uh it's also the the city and
[05:14] and the whole culture around that is
[05:17] really interesting. Um how does the um
[05:21] historical context matter or how does it
[05:23] influence of of how you look at at
[05:25] Bitcoin?
[05:28] Um yeah, I mean it's it's kind of the
[05:31] way I see it and and that's also the way
[05:34] it's described in in in the book that
[05:35] the the Bitcoin ethos and the Bitcoin uh
[05:39] ecosystem. I mean it's for me I mean
[05:41] people are interested in different
[05:42] aspects of of Bitcoin always some people
[05:44] are more attracted to the sound money
[05:46] aspect other people's more attracted to
[05:48] the technological
[05:50] uh marvel and um for me it's difficult
[05:54] to see Bitcoin outside the context of
[05:57] like Satoshi himself said it's it's very
[05:59] attractive to the libertarian uh
[06:01] viewpoint so it's it's very difficult to
[06:04] see that a apart from from uh loving
[06:08] freedom and people being uh active uh
[06:11] trying to promote and and to safeguard
[06:13] their own liberty. Um
[06:16] and yeah, like like I said, that that's
[06:19] kind of woven through the history of of
[06:21] the the Czech Republic. and um and yeah
[06:26] that it's kind of like a logical
[06:28] continuation that it was almost meant me
[06:29] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[06:29] me me me me me me meant me me me me me
[06:30] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[06:30] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[06:30] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[06:30] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[06:30] me me meant to become the Bitcoin
[06:31] capital in at at least in in Europe uh
[06:34] with with so many innovations coming
[06:36] coming from Prague uh around around
[06:38] Bitcoin itself that uh it I see it as as
[06:42] a logical continuation of of a longer
[06:44] longer process. Um and yeah, that's
[06:48] that's kind of my my answer. You you're
[06:50] originally from uh from Holland, right?
[06:54] I assume that just from the way you
[06:55] speak.
[06:57] Yeah, I'm Dutch. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh do
[07:00] you live in in in in Holland or you
[07:02] already live in Prague? No, no, no. I I
[07:05] live somewhere in in the Balkans. So, I
[07:07] uh I I decided to be uh be outside the
[07:10] European Union for kind of the same
[07:12] reasons I was just describing because I
[07:14] don't think it's it's going in the right
[07:16] direction. Um and uh but uh yeah go
[07:21] going going to the I mean the office for
[07:23] BDC Prague is not actually in in Prague
[07:25] itself. It's in in Ostraa which is a
[07:27] city in the north northeast closer to
[07:30] the Polish border. That's where Martin
[07:32] and Matias the the founders uh are from.
[07:36] Uh so I I go there a few times a year
[07:37] obviously for for meetups and and
[07:39] brainstorming sessions and and
[07:41] strategizing. Uh so no I I don't live
[07:44] there but uh I I love to go there. It's
[07:46] a it's a nice country, nice people and
[07:48] and Prague is a beautiful city. Yeah.
[07:51] Czech is one of those places that uh
[07:55] it is is really want to shift away from
[07:59] uh from what I understand from what the
[08:01] EU is is is doing a little bit like
[08:03] Hungary. I mean it's not totally um
[08:06] comparable. Um I mean Swiss is for
[08:09] example not in the EU and and they're
[08:10] also making their own things. So Czech
[08:13] is one of the places that gives me a
[08:14] little bit of hope for Europe also uh
[08:16] with the implementations of laws and and
[08:19] stuff like that. How do you look at
[08:20] that? Yeah, it feel it feels more no
[08:24] nonsense. I remember maybe one or two
[08:26] years ago, I was just on YouTube and
[08:28] you're watching some stuff and then uh
[08:30] YouTube uh recommends some some other uh
[08:34] other videos and I just stumbled upon uh
[08:36] like this short 10 or 15 minute
[08:38] documentary about um gun ownership in in
[08:42] the Czech Republic. Turns out that
[08:43] actually the laws over there are kind of
[08:46] similar to what you have in many states
[08:48] in in the US where people can just apply
[08:50] for a license, go through all the
[08:52] checks, blah blah blah, and then get a
[08:53] concealed carry license for personal
[08:55] protection. I didn't even know that. I
[08:57] mean, in in the Netherlands, that's like
[08:59] completely out of the question. And I
[09:01] wasn't even aware that that still there
[09:03] were still EU countries where that was
[09:05] that was an option. So that's just I
[09:07] mean wherever people stand on on the
[09:10] right to to carry carry a firearm for
[09:12] for your own protection uh it it shows
[09:15] that the the Czech Republic is kind of
[09:17] uh different in in in that sense that
[09:20] and and like you mentioned the the Czech
[09:22] National Bank now seriously studying
[09:25] Bitcoin as a as a as a potential reserve
[09:28] asset. the law that they recently passed
[09:30] which makes uh which actually
[09:32] incentivizes hodling that people after
[09:35] uh three years don't pay capital gains
[09:37] tax on on their holdings anymore and and
[09:40] it's actually the first country that
[09:42] implements a law that on the one hand is
[09:44] within the micica framework also
[09:47] whatever you think about it also not I
[09:50] don't think it's it's it's a good
[09:51] development but on the other hand for
[09:53] businesses that want to do something in
[09:55] the Bitcoin space they want to be active
[09:57] there uh there there was no clear-cut
[10:00] regulation how how you can have a
[10:02] company within the EU and cater to uh or
[10:05] or have customers from from all EU
[10:08] countries and and be compliant with with
[10:11] all all the legislation that basically
[10:13] required uh different rules for each
[10:16] each EU uh country. So in in that sense
[10:20] the Czech Republic is the first country
[10:21] that that launched a law that on the one
[10:23] hand u yeah safeguards some some
[10:27] freedoms for the individual at the same
[10:29] time gives companies a framework that
[10:31] they can at least know okay if I stick
[10:33] to this I will be compliant and I can
[10:36] preserve my customers.
[10:38] Yeah the the micer uh micro ruling is is
[10:42] interesting. Uh, how do you look at what
[10:44] what what what Mike is bringing for for
[10:47] Europe there? Like with the travel rule
[10:48] and there's some very controversial
[10:50] stuff in there. I'm I'm not a big expert
[10:52] on on that. Before I joined BDC Prague,
[10:54] I worked with a small uh a small
[10:57] boutique uh Bitcoin brokerage company.
[11:00] Uh and obviously the I was also doing
[11:03] marketing there, so I wasn't really
[11:04] involved in the operational and and
[11:06] legal side. Um but uh yeah, like I said,
[11:10] on the one hand, you if if you want to
[11:12] run a company, you need some kind of
[11:13] legal framework. You need some kind of
[11:15] uh legislation and and it has to be
[11:17] clearcut that you know, okay, the these
[11:19] are the rules. If I apply for this
[11:21] license, then then I'm I'm okay. Uh and
[11:24] the interesting thing with with the law
[11:26] that was recently passed in the Czech
[11:28] Republic that is also the first law that
[11:31] more or less forces banks to give a bank
[11:34] account uh to these companies if if they
[11:37] if they have the license and that that
[11:39] was kind of a lottery in and and still
[11:41] is in in many other EU countries. If you
[11:44] have only if you have the word Bitcoin
[11:46] in your company name is uh well I know
[11:47] from the Netherlands is is a big no-go.
[11:50] uh you can easily get uh get debanked
[11:52] and even if if it's not in your company
[11:54] name but it's the nature of your
[11:56] activities then it can also be an issue.
[11:59] So um yeah, like I said, on the one
[12:02] hand, it provides a leg legal basis to
[12:04] to to to work uh work with what you
[12:09] mentioned, the travel rule obviously is
[12:10] is entirely uh against the the whole
[12:13] idea and and nature of of Bitcoin,
[12:16] including your your KYC data in in each
[12:19] and every transaction. So to be honest,
[12:22] I don't know how the Czech Republic is
[12:24] is planning to implement that and and
[12:27] what it means for for the individual
[12:28] companies there. So in that sense, I
[12:30] think it's it's still a negative
[12:32] development. Uh but yeah, well time time
[12:35] will tell probably. Really interesting.
[12:37] And you said you worked in an uh at an
[12:40] OTC uh brokerage probably like for for
[12:43] companies and for high net worth
[12:44] individuals, I I assume. Yeah. Yeah,
[12:47] that was a like I said a very very small
[12:49] it it doesn't doesn't really exist
[12:50] anymore. Uh kind of went went belly up.
[12:53] Uh but it was uh it was mainly catering
[12:55] to OTC clients. Yeah. What what did you
[12:57] learn from from that experience with
[12:59] like uh dealing with OTC clients versus
[13:03] uh now with Bitcoin Prague? Uh it's a
[13:05] it's a I mean it's it's a completely
[13:08] different thing. Yeah, it's a completely
[13:10] different audience. I mean in that OTC
[13:12] brokerage it's it's mainly word of
[13:14] mouth. I mean I I I was brought on as a
[13:16] as a CMO in that company sometime after
[13:19] the whole uh COVID thing because before
[13:22] CO they could just step on on a plane
[13:25] and shake hands with people and do deals
[13:27] in in person and then you had this whole
[13:29] lockdown thing and they understood okay
[13:30] we need a presence with a good website
[13:33] we need a presence on social media so
[13:34] people also remotely can see that we are
[13:37] trustworthy and and uh and we're we're a
[13:40] real company. Um but still uh the main
[13:44] business development and uh was was word
[13:47] of mouth just people introducing you to
[13:50] others. Uh so that is difficult to to
[13:53] compare to uh to BDC Prague. Obviously
[13:56] we have multiple audiences and multiple
[13:58] ticket tiers. So it's it's it's uh I
[14:01] mean it's Bitcoin related but in in in
[14:03] other ways it's it's difficult to
[14:05] compare. Really interesting. What what
[14:08] would you say uh and and I had that uh a
[14:11] discussion already with other people,
[14:12] but what would you say is the soul of of
[14:14] Bitcoin Prague? Like what is the spirit
[14:16] of of it?
[14:19] Bitcoin just staying staying true to to
[14:22] the like we discussed earlier the ethos
[14:25] of of Bitcoin as uh as closely as uh as
[14:28] possible. And I mean currently with the
[14:30] current market movements uh it's uh even
[14:34] compared to to last year there obviously
[14:36] is a lot more interest from companies
[14:39] and individuals that are active in in
[14:41] the broader altcoins uh space so to
[14:44] speak uh and and we have a very strict
[14:47] policy on uh on that. I mean there are
[14:48] there are
[14:49] companies let's say there are companies
[14:52] that that cater to those audiences as
[14:54] well but within BDC Prague be it on
[14:57] stage or in the in the expo there is no
[15:00] no promotion of uh of what we call
[15:03] shitcoins. Uh so it's that that is the
[15:05] the ethos very much. Um, I think it's
[15:09] also just the Martin and Matias uh the
[15:12] reason why why they they started this um
[15:16] and the fact that it's their is their
[15:18] full-time job. So, so many conferences
[15:21] or some some conferences are kind of a
[15:23] side thing that are organized by a
[15:26] company or some individuals that have
[15:28] other activities as well. For them, it's
[15:30] it's a full-time job. So it's year year
[15:32] round uh after the event obviously
[15:35] evaluating analyzing starting to plan
[15:37] for the next year and throughout the
[15:40] year it's just uh continuous process of
[15:42] of improvement uh think coming up with
[15:45] new things um and it's I mean just ask
[15:48] anyone I mean what the intro you gave
[15:50] yourself that it's close to your heart
[15:52] and that is the feedback that we get
[15:54] from from a lot of people it's it it was
[15:56] my uh it wasn't my first Bitcoin
[15:59] conference I think it was my second or
[16:00] my third when I went in in 23. Uh but it
[16:03] was immediately my favorite. It was also
[16:05] the biggest I I went to. The the fir
[16:07] first one I went went to was uh RIA
[16:11] Baltic Honeybadger. Awesome conference,
[16:13] like really OG, smaller scale, very nice
[16:16] atmosphere. Um, and I was really
[16:18] surprised when I went to Prague that in
[16:20] terms of scale, it was a lot bigger, but
[16:23] it still managed to retain the the feel
[16:25] and the atmosphere, the vibe of of a
[16:28] smaller meetup of of a meetup I used to
[16:29] go to in Amsterdam with 100 people that
[16:31] kind of that same vibe, but then with
[16:33] thousands of people around you. So that
[16:36] is yeah combined with what I said like
[16:38] the Bitcoin only ethos and really
[16:41] innovating each year in terms of topics
[16:44] and uh and and the approach u it's uh
[16:47] yeah that's that's what what what makes
[16:49] it according to many others also the uh
[16:52] the best Bitcoin conference in the
[16:53] world. It it's really cool because
[16:57] you've managed to make it big and still
[17:00] high signal and and like Bitcoin only uh
[17:04] and and there are there many questions
[17:06] in this. Uh but let's start with like
[17:09] why is that so important for for Bitcoin
[17:11] Prague?
[17:13] Um I mean why is yeah why is why is that
[17:16] so important for for us? I mean, uh, for
[17:20] for I think for any any Bitcoiner, uh,
[17:23] from a business perspective, it, uh,
[17:25] things would be a lot easier if the
[17:26] policy was wasn't that strict. That's
[17:28] kind of kind of makes sense, right?
[17:29] Because we all know that these altcoin
[17:31] projects, they have huge marketing
[17:33] budgets. And, uh, from a business
[17:36] standpoint, it would make stuff a lot a
[17:38] lot easier. But uh it's my personal
[17:41] view, but that's I think the the the
[17:43] view of of most Bitcoiners and most
[17:45] definitely of of Martin and Matias as
[17:47] well that Bitcoin is truth you know it's
[17:49] it's open source there is no no central
[17:53] authority there is no CEO there is no
[17:55] marketing department uh although you
[17:57] could consider events like us the
[17:59] marketing department but that's not
[18:01] directly uh related to the Bitcoin the
[18:05] network or Bitcoin the asset
[18:07] um And that is kind of completely
[18:11] different with all these old coins.
[18:12] There is always some kind of development
[18:15] team, some kind of CEO, early investors.
[18:17] And it's if you if you're new to the
[18:19] space, it all looks the same. You just
[18:21] see another logo in in the app where
[18:23] people buy coins and uh this one uh is
[18:27] uh is cheaper than that one and they buy
[18:29] the other coin. But if you're long long
[18:31] enough in in in this space, then you
[18:33] understand that that whole altcoin space
[18:36] is is kind of fiat 2.0. It's just an
[18:40] easier way to get uh liquidity and and
[18:43] get investment from from retail
[18:46] investors without all the the the hoops
[18:50] people need to go go through uh in in
[18:53] terms of regulations with with normal u
[18:56] securities offerings basically. And
[18:59] people only find find that out when they
[19:00] get dumped on uh at the end of the of
[19:03] the cycle. So in that in that sense
[19:05] there it's just I mean it's it's
[19:09] 99% that or maybe 98 and then the other
[19:13] one or 2% are just projects of uh tech
[19:16] geeks I mean in the altcoin space that
[19:19] that try to build something and yeah uh
[19:23] without the ulterior motives without the
[19:25] the scamming aspect. Um, but those are
[19:29] very few and and far uh very yeah few
[19:32] and and far between. Um, and and still I
[19:36] mean yeah, you're still buying some some
[19:39] kind of asset, some kind of coin of that
[19:42] specific uh project that isn't going to
[19:46] solve or doesn't have the potential to
[19:48] solve issues in the world uh compar
[19:52] compared to
[19:53] Bitcoin. So it's Yeah.
[19:57] It it's it's fascinating this Bitcoin
[19:59] only focus because I also see everything
[20:02] else except Bitcoin as either a scam or
[20:05] uh it's just useless. So yeah, that's
[20:08] kind of what I mean. It's it's kind of
[20:11] idealist that they're trying or
[20:12] tinkering with some stuff and something
[20:14] interesting can come from it, but but
[20:16] then still they're doing it on
[20:18] infrastructure that is running on on AWS
[20:20] or or Google Cloud or whatever. um and
[20:23] and just uh painting it with the
[20:26] decentralized meme almost uh while in
[20:30] fact uh one one court order to to Amazon
[20:32] can uh can pull the plug on on that
[20:35] whole thing. So it's it's uh what they
[20:37] call decentralized in in name only. It's
[20:39] it's kind of uh decentralization theater
[20:42] and and that's the that's the the the
[20:45] the crucial difference with with
[20:47] Bitcoin. It it's also the question of
[20:50] how much like what does to what what
[20:54] what should be decentralized? Money
[20:56] obviously is something that should be
[20:58] decentralized and is currently
[20:59] centralized with central banks. It's
[21:02] even in the names which is really funny.
[21:04] Uh but honestly um if I play play a
[21:08] video game uh and uh I use a video game
[21:11] token, I don't need that decentralized.
[21:14] I'm I'm fine that there's like company
[21:18] behind that and maybe they can be more
[21:21] open, maybe they can work
[21:23] I'm not a gamer myself, but there have
[21:25] also been instances where that position
[21:28] kind of like a central bank was abused
[21:30] by that company when when the game
[21:31] became really popular printing more of
[21:33] those tokens and more or less financing
[21:35] their operations like that. So it's uh
[21:39] that even even there you see the the
[21:41] fiat tendencies starting to uh to to
[21:43] come up in in in those kind of areas. So
[21:46] maybe it should be decentralized. I
[21:48] think there are also companies in in the
[21:49] Bitcoin space that are doing something
[21:51] with with gaming. Uh but obviously
[21:54] decentralizing money and separation of
[21:56] money and state is is orders of
[21:57] magnitude more important than tokens in
[22:00] in a game if if you ask me. Absolutely.
[22:03] Yeah. And and that's kind of the thing
[22:06] with like uh we we can build something
[22:08] maybe on top of Bitcoin or whatever. Um,
[22:11] but how important is something to be
[22:14] actually decentralized? And is it
[22:16] actually decentralized when there's
[22:18] still a a company behind that that needs
[22:21] to to push something on? Like even the
[22:23] the supply chain thing where like, oh,
[22:26] we we want a decentralized blockchain
[22:29] that that's uh shows the supply chain.
[22:32] That's great. In bananas on the
[22:35] blockchain, right? Yeah, exactly.
[22:36] there's there's still someone that has
[22:38] to put things on top of of that
[22:40] blockchain and it's still like this
[22:41] oracle problem. It's I didn't talk since
[22:45] very long time on on the podcast about
[22:46] that but I think it's important to to
[22:49] make that distinguish uh between Bitcoin
[22:51] and all the altcoins and also uh one
[22:55] thing you mentioned is um the marketing
[22:57] team of Bitcoin because I think it's
[22:58] it's super interesting to see the whole
[23:01] industry working together the
[23:03] conferences the podcasts the different
[23:05] media types the the speakers the guests
[23:07] like everything is working so perfectly
[23:10] together and there's nobody in charge
[23:13] much. It's kind of magical how Bitcoin
[23:16] marketing is just working perfectly even
[23:20] though there's no Satoshi Nakamoto that
[23:22] gives everyone a script and like hey uh
[23:24] you do this and then you have the
[23:26] podcast with them and then like there's
[23:28] no one in charge of that. It's kind of
[23:29] magical I think. Yeah. No, I fully agree
[23:32] and that that's what people that are new
[23:33] to the space they don't they don't see
[23:35] the difference. They like I said they
[23:37] they just are completely new. A
[23:39] colleague tells them okay install. I
[23:40] mean I've had that experience myself.
[23:42] colle colleague tells them, "Okay,
[23:44] install this app." And then they they
[23:46] see Bitcoin. Oh,
[23:48] it's many tens of thousands of of euros
[23:52] and this other coin on the second or the
[23:54] third on the list costs only two or
[23:56] three euros. That that that one is a lot
[23:58] cheaper. So, if that one goes to 30,000,
[24:00] then I'm I'm a billionaire. And they
[24:02] don't understand the how how how stuff
[24:04] works like that. And and then with the
[24:06] the marketing, I mean, you get that
[24:08] criticism. You see it on X on social
[24:10] media. people calling uh us uh
[24:14] maximalists uh not not realizing that
[24:17] the marketing narratives that they are
[24:19] paring that they are repeating are
[24:21] coming from people that are using
[24:23] basically their money that they invested
[24:25] to to create that that promotion for
[24:28] whatever altcoin or network uh
[24:31] blockchain network it is uh and with
[24:34] Bitcoin obviously I mean if you're
[24:36] running doesn't matter if you're running
[24:37] a Bitcoin company or a Bitcoin podcast
[24:39] or a Bitcoin conference There is a
[24:41] business aspect. There is a there is
[24:43] people are are trying to make a living.
[24:45] Um but that is and it is related to
[24:49] Bitcoin but not in the way it is related
[24:51] to uh those other altcoin products the
[24:54] project. There is a direct link and and
[24:57] a control over over that that token be
[24:59] it proof of stake or whatever but there
[25:02] is a a lot a lot more control. I mean,
[25:04] Bitcoin can still exist and and function
[25:07] wi when without half or even more of
[25:10] this whole ecosystem of podcasters and
[25:12] people being the quote unquote marketing
[25:15] department for uh for for for Bitcoin.
[25:18] So, I mean that that's the hallmark of
[25:20] of real decentralization. I mean, nobody
[25:23] is is the marketing department for the
[25:26] internet right now. I mean at a certain
[25:28] point the internet was also some kind of
[25:31] project among geeks and then it it
[25:33] gained traction and mainstream adoption
[25:35] and then you had commercials for just
[25:37] getting an internet connection and I
[25:40] mean that grew and grew and grew and now
[25:42] it's a protocol. It's a it's a worldwide
[25:44] system. It's a network and nobody is
[25:46] making promotion for the internet as
[25:49] such anymore. It's the base layer of
[25:50] everything else that's built on on top
[25:52] of it. But the whole problem with that
[25:55] was that there was no native protocol
[25:57] for transferring value. So that is what
[26:00] what what uh what Bitcoin is adding of
[26:02] course. Yeah. The TCPIP token basically
[26:05] it's like we always talk about that we
[26:08] we always like the there are so many
[26:09] different protocols and layers attached
[26:11] to the internet like TCPIP and stuff
[26:14] like that. Uh, but there's like this one
[26:16] puzzle piece that's missing and it's
[26:17] it's it's money and Bitcoin is now
[26:20] finally delivering the final puzzle
[26:22] piece that we need for for for that
[26:24] internet layer or however you you want
[26:26] you want to call that. That's that's
[26:28] really cool. Yeah. And the interesting
[26:30] thing with the internet is that there
[26:31] there was also kind of a fight which um
[26:34] which protocol would would become the uh
[26:37] the main protocol for the for the
[26:39] internet and it wasn't the one where
[26:40] that the I think IBM and other other big
[26:43] corporates were were uh were in favor of
[26:45] and working on and it was this smaller
[26:48] group of uh of kind of also tech tech
[26:51] nerds creating a more flexible protocol
[26:54] and it it it in the end I mean I'm not
[26:56] an expert on on this but I think in the
[26:58] end it wasn't even the the protocol that
[27:00] had the most bells and whistles, that
[27:02] had the most possibilities, it was it
[27:04] was more clunky and simple, but we
[27:06] managed to build the entire internet on
[27:08] on top of it. So, the the criticisms of
[27:10] of Bitcoin being too slow and being too
[27:13] simple, not having enough um
[27:16] possibilities with its it its scripting
[27:18] language and and programmability. Uh
[27:21] that that stuff will get solved over
[27:23] time. The you want the what what as
[27:25] Michael Sailor calls it the bedrock.
[27:27] want something like a really stable
[27:29] foundation that that cannot be shaken
[27:31] and then everything else uh eventually
[27:33] will be built on on top of it. Obviously
[27:35] there there are challenges there but uh
[27:38] it's uh that that's a matter of time. I
[27:39] mean 16 years is is not much much in
[27:43] that in that sense. Yeah, the simple
[27:46] aspect is what gives it its um
[27:49] uniqueness because it's if it would be
[27:52] very complicated, it would be also very
[27:54] complicated to verify. Uh it there would
[27:57] be a lot of uh moving pieces and the
[28:01] more moving pieces the the more
[28:03] complicated the the more likely it is
[28:05] that it just fails or has a bug or like
[28:08] crashes and we don't want that to happen
[28:10] to the base layer. We can have that on
[28:12] layer three or four, whatever. Exactly.
[28:14] Exactly. You you don't want uh Yeah.
[28:17] Don't don't want that that to get to get
[28:18] hacked. I mean, it's the the biggest the
[28:21] biggest honeypot in uh or the biggest
[28:23] bug bounty in uh in in history and
[28:27] nobody has hacked it so far at the base
[28:29] layer.
[28:31] That that that would be a good it's the
[28:34] biggest back bounty program ever and
[28:36] it's open and permissionless for
[28:38] everyone to do. So yeah, any any any
[28:41] talented prodigy hacker can uh can can
[28:44] try and uh but that that's what you said
[28:47] the simplicity is kind of kind of a
[28:49] safeguard again against that and that's
[28:51] that's what you definitely need if you
[28:52] want to decentralize uh the the the
[28:55] monetary base layer for for the entire
[28:58] world. Super interesting. Also one
[29:00] aspect um that you brought up is like
[29:04] what if people are stop saying something
[29:07] about Bitcoin? So what if every podcast
[29:10] conference, every uh development uh
[29:14] engineering company stops? This brings
[29:17] us interesting enough to a point of uh
[29:20] what what's uh Jeff Bou always calls we
[29:22] are bitcoin. uh it's the social layer of
[29:25] of Bitcoin that's that's the valuable
[29:27] thing because we can copy the code but
[29:30] we cannot copy the the social layer and
[29:32] if if someone stops a Bitcoin podcast
[29:35] there's space then for another one if
[29:38] someone uh if if for example Bitcoin
[29:41] Prague completely shuts down this gives
[29:42] a lot of space for someone else to come
[29:44] and say hey there's a lot of people
[29:46] always coming to Bitcoin Prague then
[29:48] let's do something anyways uh with a
[29:52] different organization let's do it I
[29:54] don't know in Budapest like there's so
[29:56] many so many smaller conferences so
[29:58] there would someone step up uh and and
[30:01] that's kind of the beauty where um you
[30:04] don't you you don't need a centralized
[30:06] head above that to organize it it's
[30:08] organic and natural and this is the the
[30:11] the the magic from it is it's really
[30:14] cool yeah yeah I mean while you were
[30:16] saying that I was just thinking imagine
[30:18] I mean there are Ethereum conferences
[30:20] but imagine organizing a big Ethereum
[30:23] conference and Vitalik and the whole dev
[30:26] team and consensus they are against you.
[30:28] They hate you for whatever reason. They
[30:30] hate you and they they are not going to
[30:32] uh cooperate with you and they tell
[30:34] everyone they are working with and they
[30:36] are in touch with telling telling them
[30:39] to to basically cancel your event.
[30:41] there's no event
[30:43] right and that with Bitcoin obviously I
[30:47] mean there are influential people but
[30:49] but still uh with Bitcoin once again
[30:52] that is completely different because
[30:54] nobody is owner of the protocol nobody
[30:56] is in in charge of the protocol or the
[30:58] infrastructure so there I mean there is
[31:00] competition there are people that are
[31:02] especially when the price is ranging
[31:05] it's kind of flat you have all the
[31:07] discussions and and and fighting taking
[31:10] place sometimes times on on on X. So
[31:14] there are there are egos everywhere. Uh
[31:17] so that still happens. But even then
[31:19] there is there is a a crucial uh crucial
[31:22] difference uh when you're talking about
[31:25] decentralized protocol like like this
[31:27] kind of similar like you had internet
[31:30] conferences in in the past going back to
[31:32] to that that example. I mean it's not
[31:35] having an internet conference right now.
[31:37] Yeah. Doesn't doesn't really make sense
[31:38] anymore. So in the long term I also
[31:40] think and expect that people will look
[31:43] back if if Bitcoin does what we all hope
[31:45] and what we all think it has the
[31:47] potential uh of like like I just said
[31:49] decentralizing the monetary base layer
[31:51] of of the entire world then at a certain
[31:54] point there won't be any Bitcoin
[31:55] conference anymore. Anyone ever every
[31:56] everyone knows it and use it uses it
[32:00] like we use the internet right now
[32:01] without without knowing the technical
[32:04] the way it works technically on under
[32:06] the hood but with so many layers on top
[32:08] of it that it's just becoming uh
[32:10] becoming uh yeah the bread and butter of
[32:13] of everyone's life uh in in in a
[32:16] financial sense and yeah that's uh
[32:21] that's that's yeah still pretty pretty
[32:24] different in uh compared to the the
[32:28] those claiming to be faster, better, and
[32:30] and just as decentralized,
[32:33] nobody can copy the cyber hornets. No,
[32:37] no. But what you said about the the
[32:38] social layer, that's also interesting
[32:40] because it's it's it's it's not going
[32:42] away. It's uh and and you sometimes see
[32:45] these polls or people asking on on
[32:47] social as well uh like what what if uh
[32:51] the Bitcoin price would stay at this
[32:52] level forever or would or it would be
[32:55] $10,000 forever? Would you still be in
[32:58] in in the space? Would you still be a
[32:59] Bitcoiner? I think for most of us that
[33:02] would go I mean number go up is is
[33:04] interesting obviously for uh for
[33:06] everyone the sound money aspect and then
[33:08] being being able to um to uh to save for
[33:13] the future and and have your uh your net
[33:17] worth or your um your purchasing power
[33:20] go up over time in instead of going
[33:21] going down. That's that's hugely
[33:23] important. But on the other hand, the
[33:26] decentralized aspect, the sovereignty,
[33:28] the the permissionless aspect that you
[33:30] can use it without asking any anyone's
[33:33] permission. You can use it to send
[33:34] anywhere
[33:36] um and and and transact with anyone. I
[33:39] think that that is hugely val valuable.
[33:41] Even even in that scenario, I don't I
[33:43] don't think Bitcoin would go away. Let's
[33:45] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[33:48] the beauty that coin vigilante has made
[33:51] with the Bitcoin watches. Those watches
[33:53] are the most amazing, the most eleigent
[33:56] way of showing that you are a true
[33:59] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[34:02] dropped a completely new and amazing
[34:04] Genesis edition of their watch
[34:07] collections. You have the date of the
[34:09] first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[34:12] there. And of course, also the block
[34:14] height and which epoch we are currently
[34:17] in. I love the level of detail they put
[34:20] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[34:23] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[34:26] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[34:28] love those watches so so much. And now
[34:31] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[34:34] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[34:36] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[34:38] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[34:40] first way is you put it on a hardware
[34:42] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[34:46] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[34:48] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[34:52] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[34:54] if you check out the link in the
[34:56] description, you even get 5% off if you
[34:59] use the code Robin. And the second way
[35:02] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[35:05] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[35:08] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[35:11] They will personalize for you a
[35:13] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[35:16] your individual situation. They will
[35:19] show you how you can secure your own
[35:21] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[35:24] enough. You also have to keep all your
[35:26] devices secure. One topic that is
[35:28] overlooked often is the inheritance
[35:30] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[35:33] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[35:36] a plan for that in place already? And
[35:38] last but not least, if you're in a
[35:40] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[35:43] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[35:45] that, head over to the
[35:49] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[35:51] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[35:54] will be for the first time ever speaking
[35:57] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[36:00] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[36:02] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:04] you there. You can get your ticket in
[36:07] the link down in the description of
[36:09] Bitcoin Prague and very important use
[36:11] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[36:15] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[36:17] there. How how important is is the
[36:21] Bitcoin price and do you also see
[36:24] correlation between I mean it's uh it's
[36:27] it's it's diff difficult to compare but
[36:29] do you see correlations between uh the
[36:31] Bitcoin price and even ticket sales for
[36:33] Bitcoin bra and stuff like that? Yeah, I
[36:36] think so. Um I mean the I I don't know
[36:42] to which extent this this goes for other
[36:44] types of events but what I heard from uh
[36:47] from from Martin from our CEO that since
[36:50] since co they they basically before they
[36:52] launched BDC Prague they started a
[36:54] smaller scale uh conference in in their
[36:57] hometown Bitcoin conference for the
[36:59] Czech and and soak uh
[37:02] Bitcoiners which started with like 500
[37:05] people and then doubled every a year.
[37:07] Um, and they started that during during
[37:10] co uh they just had a window of a few
[37:12] weeks when the restrictions were were
[37:13] dropped and that they could successfully
[37:16] organize this this
[37:17] conference. But uh what what Martin what
[37:20] I heard from him is that since those
[37:22] days of of the those co restrictions
[37:24] with whether it's music festivals or
[37:27] other events, people buy tickets at the
[37:28] last moment because you never know
[37:30] what's going to happen. Maybe some other
[37:32] lockdown. I think with with our
[37:34] conference and with Bitcoin conferences
[37:36] in general on top of that you you have
[37:38] the aspect that people are watching the
[37:40] price. So if they they
[37:41] they are planning to spend a few hundred
[37:44] euros worth of uh of money for for a
[37:47] ticket and they're expecting or hoping
[37:49] that the price will go up, they'll wait
[37:51] till till the last moment. I mean that
[37:53] that gamble can also go the other way
[37:55] for you of course but what what we see
[37:58] uh what what I remember from from last
[38:00] year is that uh a really big chunk of of
[38:04] the sales takes place in the last few
[38:05] weeks. Um and and then obviously we we
[38:09] have the the end of the month countdown
[38:10] when when prices go go up slightly. So
[38:13] that those are also peaks. Uh and then
[38:16] the third aspect like you said is more
[38:18] or less the the Bitcoin price movements.
[38:20] So what we now see with Bitcoin prices a
[38:23] lot higher and the general interest in
[38:25] Bitcoin being higher than in in previous
[38:27] years, we also see that ticket sales are
[38:30] already ramping up earlier in in in the
[38:33] year than uh than in in previous years.
[38:35] So obviously the the market conditions
[38:37] and the Bitcoin price are are
[38:39] influencing that.
[38:41] This is super interesting to see. Um,
[38:44] I've never heard that because it it it
[38:47] shows the the time preference aspect of
[38:52] uh Bitcoiners and the impact that
[38:54] Bitcoin has on our financial behaviors.
[38:57] That's uh with the I think almost like
[39:01] most Bitcoin conferences actually follow
[39:03] a model where prices increase over time
[39:06] to incentivize to buy early obviously
[39:09] because we know Bitcoin is going up. If
[39:12] I have now the the the selection of hey
[39:15] I can buy my Bitcoin product ticket
[39:17] today or right before the event,
[39:21] everyone will opt in for right before
[39:23] the event because Bitcoin might go up.
[39:26] But if the price is increasing, you
[39:29] incentivize you make the opposite
[39:31] incentivization of like hey maybe I
[39:34] should put it early because maybe the
[39:37] Bitcoin price is also going down. It's a
[39:38] gamble honestly because Bitcoin price
[39:40] can go uh up 50% or down 50% up till
[39:45] till the till the uh till the event
[39:47] probably not that big but uh just just
[39:49] to show it. So that's super interesting
[39:52] insight of how time preference with
[39:55] Bitcoin is changing. Yeah, definitely. I
[39:59] mean, I I've experienced that myself
[40:02] over the years. when you when you just
[40:04] live on a bitcoin standard and and keep
[40:06] your own uh your own uh net worth in in
[40:10] in bitcoin uh then any decisions and the
[40:13] bigger the decision whether it's uh a
[40:15] holiday or a trip or buying a house or
[40:18] whatever that is all hugely influenced
[40:21] by your expectation of what what will
[40:23] happen to your uh your your purchasing
[40:26] power over the uh over the mid and and
[40:29] long term. Um, so yeah, but yeah, what
[40:32] what we say is don't don't take a short
[40:34] position on on BDC Prague because you
[40:36] like it it's it's kind of a gamble.
[40:38] People wait until the last moment hoping
[40:40] that the Bitcoin price will go up and
[40:41] they have to spend less sets on on their
[40:43] on their ticket. Um, but that can also
[40:46] go the other way. So that's what I said.
[40:48] Uh, don't don't short BDC Prague. Just
[40:50] make sure you're there and and lock in
[40:53] your uh your ticket. Absolutely. can can
[40:57] go can go in in many different
[40:59] directions. Um, how did actually Bitcoin
[41:02] uh impact uh your your own own life?
[41:07] Yeah, in a in a big way. Um,
[41:10] uh, I'm class of 2017. So, we had a a
[41:15] bull market then when Bitcoin went from
[41:18] I think somewhere around one or 2,000 to
[41:21] 20 20,000 and somewhere around
[41:25] $15,000. Uh it was the the talk at the
[41:28] office in in in my my fiat job then and
[41:30] I knew nothing about it. Um so
[41:33] I I became interested in it was was a
[41:36] colleague who had a friend who was a
[41:38] trader and he knew more about it. he
[41:39] already had a hardware wallet. And so I
[41:42] I watched YouTube videos about how to do
[41:45] this correctly and and safely uh and uh
[41:49] for for about two or 3 weeks every
[41:51] evening just trying to educate myself.
[41:54] Um obviously already getting getting a
[41:56] lot of the the the shitcoin uh
[42:00] promotion in uh in in my timeline. Uh
[42:04] but uh yeah, bought bought my my first
[42:07] bitcoin in 2017 and then it it doubled
[42:12] in I don't know uh and like I said I
[42:15] also bought some some some [ __ ] coins
[42:17] and my my portfolio doubled in in in a
[42:20] few weeks and then almost tripled in a
[42:22] few weeks more and I was already
[42:24] extrapolating making making an excel
[42:27] sheet like okay if this is continuing
[42:29] for x amount of time I'm a millionaire
[42:32] not knowing anything about these market
[42:34] cycles and about bare markets or or
[42:36] anything. So then you had the 2018 bare
[42:39] market and it all went down and like I
[42:42] said I I I bought a lot of shitcoin so
[42:44] they they went down most of them like
[42:48] 90% or or more so lost almost all of it.
[42:52] Um and but I was hooked and and
[42:55] interested enough
[42:57] uh to to start listening to podcast
[43:00] because I wasn't really listening to to
[43:02] any podcast at at that time. There was
[43:04] podcasting was kind of becoming more
[43:07] more common then. Uh so I installed some
[43:10] app and there was this first Dutch bit
[43:13] or or it was called the cryptocast. So,
[43:15] cryp crypto podcast. Um, and and that
[43:18] got got me interested in in general. And
[43:21] then from there, just yeah, listening to
[43:24] ebooks uh the Bitcoin standard um and
[43:28] just educating myself uh more and more
[43:31] and throughout through that whole that
[43:33] whole bare market and then uh the yeah
[43:36] the next bull market came and at a
[43:38] certain point I also thought okay uh
[43:40] I've gained so much. I mean, you have
[43:42] Clubhouse. So, I was I was um I was a
[43:45] co- co-odderator or co-host of the the
[43:48] largest Bitcoin Clubhouse room in in the
[43:50] Netherlands with a few other other
[43:52] guys. And yeah, at a certain point, I
[43:55] thought, okay, I I always had this dream
[43:56] of being able to work remotely, to just
[43:59] live and and live anywhere you want and
[44:02] and just work with your with your
[44:03] computer. And in the fiat job I had, uh
[44:06] that wasn't really possible. Uh so at a
[44:08] certain point I just started looking and
[44:10] thinking okay I've enough knowledge and
[44:13] network and contacts and and
[44:15] understanding of this whole space to try
[44:16] and get a get a job in in this space. So
[44:19] that's how I found my my my previous job
[44:21] and and that's how I ended up in in this
[44:24] job.
[44:25] Super interesting. And uh I I I as
[44:29] preparation I I looked into what what
[44:32] what uh other podcast you did and and I
[44:35] heard the one you did with the Bitcoin
[44:37] way. Interesting enough they also
[44:39] they're also partner of the podcast.
[44:40] That's why I was like interesting and uh
[44:43] I I want to go a little bit in the in
[44:45] the topic of freedom and and how you
[44:47] define it because you have told the
[44:50] story of you were in how is it called
[44:53] Jehovah witness I cannot pronounce.
[44:55] Jehovah's Witnesses. Yeah. uh and uh so
[44:57] and you're also not living where you
[44:59] actually grew up. So you moved away and
[45:01] now you're also working basically for
[45:03] the biggest freedom movement uh that is
[45:06] possible on on on earth. Uh how did
[45:10] those things like the the religion and
[45:12] you exiting there and and the other
[45:14] things influence uh your way of thinking
[45:16] of of Bitcoin also but also freedom?
[45:19] Yeah. Um yeah, like I explained in that
[45:22] podcast as well, um I I I won't say that
[45:26] becoming a Bitcoiner caused me to uh to
[45:30] to exit that religion or the other way
[45:32] around. U I I mean just for for your
[45:35] audience, I I I was I grew up as a as a
[45:38] Jehovah's Witness. So even my my mother
[45:41] and my grandfather were were in this in
[45:43] this religion. Um, and that was like the
[45:46] the fir first uh 40 years of of my life.
[45:50] I didn't know anything else. It was kind
[45:52] of my my ecosystem, my the space I I
[45:54] grew up in. Um, and from a freedom
[45:57] standpoint, uh, that is kind of the
[46:00] opposite there. It's it's a really long
[46:02] list. It's it's very fundamental
[46:05] explanation of the Bible, very literal
[46:07] explanation of the Bible, uh, or very
[46:10] orthodox, whatever you want to call it.
[46:13] Um and uh that comes with a long long
[46:16] list of things that you have to do and
[46:18] things that you're not allowed to do. Um
[46:21] so that is kind of the opposite of
[46:23] individual freedom just determining for
[46:25] yourself, what you like, what you want,
[46:28] what what you want to spend your time
[46:29] on, what you uh how you want to live
[46:32] your life. Um so freeing myself from
[46:35] that at a certain point I I just snip
[46:37] snapped out of it and I could I couldn't
[46:39] do it anymore.
[46:40] Um and that kind of coincided with it
[46:44] was around those same same years uh 2018
[46:48] 2019 uh that kind of coincided with
[46:51] becoming a bitcoiner with with learning
[46:52] about bitcoin. So I think it it those
[46:55] processes reinforced each other. Um and
[47:00] that's why yeah the freedom aspect as
[47:02] you can yeah judge from the conversation
[47:05] and and from that that podcast as well
[47:08] uh that the freedom aspect of of Bitcoin
[47:10] is is really very close close to my
[47:13] heart that runs pretty deep in in my
[47:15] soul so to speak.
[47:17] Yeah, I I can imagine. It's also
[47:19] probably something
[47:21] um my family is not very religious and
[47:24] and I'm a Christian and officially I'm
[47:27] out of the church because uh I didn't
[47:30] wanted to pay in Austria there's a weird
[47:32] law. So if you're in the the the church
[47:35] you actually have to pay a percentage of
[47:37] your salary to to that church. and a
[47:41] young Robin of like 18 years old got his
[47:44] first salary and said no I already get
[47:46] taxed like why should I should I pay
[47:49] more yet yet another tax yet another tax
[47:52] and I wanted to avoid that so but I I my
[47:56] exit of the church was just financially
[47:59] had nothing to do with uh with with that
[48:02] and and I don't think uh being religious
[48:06] uh means you have to pay for something
[48:08] so if you if you're in a church and you
[48:10] have to pay for it. I don't know how how
[48:11] good this is. Um, but I imagine uh
[48:15] because it was also I can imagine your
[48:18] your parents were a little bit more
[48:19] religious uh and uh this was a little
[48:22] bit uh deeper ingrained in in in your um
[48:27] basically in in your being in in your
[48:29] personality. It was probably a pretty
[48:32] hard step of like I I get out of that
[48:35] and it was a pretty big part of my life.
[48:37] 40 years it's it's it's a it's a long
[48:39] time. It was a a complete re reset of my
[48:42] life. I mean around that same time uh I
[48:45] I also got divorced. So my my my wife
[48:48] then and my my ex is is also still still
[48:51] a Jehovah's Witness and my parents and
[48:53] my sister are I don't have any contact
[48:55] with them anymore because that is also
[48:57] what the rules there are are like uh
[49:00] when when you leave and and lead a life
[49:02] that's not according to to those rules.
[49:06] Um, and like I said, it's it's a
[49:09] complete hard reset of of my life in in
[49:11] in in many in in almost every every way.
[49:15] It's I it's still I mean people that
[49:17] know me from it's it's just a handful of
[49:20] people that know me from before before
[49:22] then and and still know me now, uh, they
[49:25] they say it's hard hard to recognize
[49:27] you. You're like completely different
[49:28] person. And yeah, like I said, it's it's
[49:30] a complete complete reset because like
[49:33] like I mentioned, it's I mean for many
[49:35] people, religion is is more more or less
[49:38] like a label. So you are a Hindu, you
[49:41] are Catholic or or whatever. And it's
[49:44] it's kind of more a cultural and and
[49:46] traditional thing. It it influences what
[49:48] kind of stories uh you tell your
[49:50] children, what kind of holidays you you
[49:53] observe and things like that. um what
[49:56] what kind of traditions you have but not
[49:59] everyday life uh just every day multiple
[50:03] hours per day every week multiple hours
[50:05] per week uh and with Jehovah's Witnesses
[50:08] it's it's a total way of life where that
[50:11] religion and serving God always has to
[50:13] be in the first place and anything else
[50:15] be it um leisure or relaxing or holidays
[50:19] or hobbies or whatever always have to
[50:21] has to take uh second place um And there
[50:25] it's it's just very very intense. It's
[50:27] it's very intense. And and interesting
[50:30] interestingly what you mentioned about
[50:31] the the financial aspect the it it's
[50:35] supported with uh voluntary uh
[50:38] donations but the level of mind control
[50:41] is is that that strong that it's not
[50:44] even necessary to make it obligatory.
[50:46] It's just people do it because they uh
[50:50] because that's the level of of mind
[50:51] control in that that environment.
[50:54] So, uh, yeah, and yeah, it was, uh, was
[50:57] pretty pretty hard to to to get out of
[50:59] it, but, uh, yeah, I I can't imagine
[51:02] going going back.
[51:03] Uh, like like they say, I' I'd rather be
[51:06] be dragged dragged behind the beh be
[51:08] behind the car naked through 500 miles
[51:11] of broken glass and then go back because
[51:13] I have tasted freedom. You know,
[51:17] this is where also people say once you
[51:19] see Bitcoin, you you you don't go back
[51:22] like you you've seen the truth.
[51:27] This is this is this is really really
[51:30] interesting as someone that exited such
[51:32] a religion. Um a lot of people outside
[51:36] of of of Bitcoin also call Bitcoin a
[51:38] religion and almost a cult like thing.
[51:41] Yeah. Uh
[51:45] How can
[51:46] you how can you describe the difference
[51:49] between a cult or religion uh and and
[51:52] and Bitcoin? How do you how do you
[51:54] describe that Bitcoin isn't isn't isn't
[51:57] that as someone that lived through
[51:59] something like that? Yeah. Um there are
[52:02] a lot of similarities actually. Uh so
[52:05] even just I mean the conference I'm
[52:07] working on just walking into that kind
[52:09] of hole. Okay. There's a lot of lighting
[52:11] and and different stuff, but just
[52:13] sitting in a hall listening to talks is
[52:15] like half of my life. When I was a
[52:17] Jehovah's Witness, you had these like
[52:19] smaller meetings every few times a week
[52:22] uh in the place where you live and then
[52:24] every quarter or every half year or
[52:26] every year you had these like bigger
[52:27] size events where you're just sitting
[52:29] with your Bible on your lap listening to
[52:31] listening to talks. Uh so even from that
[52:34] perspective there were it it feels
[52:36] similar. That's like a very personal
[52:37] thing obviously but um uh there are a
[52:41] lot of other similarities. It's it's uh
[52:44] it's it's human nature in in a sense
[52:47] with the in-group outgroup thing
[52:49] tribalism
[52:50] uh people just identifying with a
[52:52] certain group and and then uh yeah that
[52:56] that provides them a structure gives
[52:59] them a social environment that is very
[53:01] similar be it Jehovah's Witnesses or or
[53:04] the Bitcoin space um and for for quite
[53:08] some time that was quite quite a cause
[53:11] of of cognitive dissonance for me uh
[53:14] just being in this ecosystem and liking
[53:17] it, understanding it, believing in it.
[53:19] Uh but at some moments I had this I had
[53:23] this this this thought in the back of of
[53:25] my head. Okay. And even, okay, my my
[53:27] girlfriend sometimes just jokingly says
[53:30] when I'm was saying something about
[53:32] Bitcoin, she she she says something
[53:34] like, uh, blessed are the are the
[53:36] believers. Like, and that was kind of
[53:40] the cognitive dissonance that I thought,
[53:42] okay, didn't I just swap one one utopia
[53:44] for the other, you know, because it's
[53:46] also hoping for a new system. And that
[53:48] that's really how in in this Jehovah's
[53:50] Witnesses religion, everything is done
[53:52] with the hope of a new world after God
[53:56] destroys the this bad world in in
[53:58] Armageddon and only the the ones that
[54:00] are that were faithful will survive.
[54:02] It's kind of the uh yeah the and and
[54:06] with Bitcoin you also have some kind of
[54:08] utopic vision of hyper bitcoinization
[54:10] when bitcoin fulfills the it its full
[54:13] potential and in that sense you can even
[54:15] call uh satoshi some kind of messiah
[54:18] figure. So if if you've lived through
[54:21] that experience, there are a lot of uh
[54:23] similarities but at a certain point I
[54:26] think it was a a thread on X by uh
[54:30] Gigi. Um I don't remember exactly but
[54:33] suddenly it clicked for me and that was
[54:35] exactly the freedom aspect. So you have
[54:38] this this base layer of truth which is
[54:41] Bitcoin but within that space it doesn't
[54:44] matter if you're I mean even with with
[54:47] this conference uh if at these Jehovah's
[54:49] Witnesses conference uh if if I was
[54:53] there and I want to go outside for for
[54:55] an hour just to hang out and talk with
[54:57] someone else that was not that was
[54:59] frowned upon. You know you have to sit
[55:00] inside and during the lunch break you go
[55:02] outside. uh at a Bitcoin conference I I
[55:05] can listen to two talks and the the rest
[55:07] of the time hang out. It doesn't matter
[55:09] what kind of clothes I wear. Uh that is
[55:13] like a completely different thing
[55:14] because freedom is like we discussed
[55:16] earlier freedom is kind of like the the
[55:19] base layer uh ethical base layer of of
[55:23] Bitcoin and that that influences
[55:26] everything else. So, Bitcoin has brought
[55:28] me yeah a lot of individual freedom and
[55:32] and um uh a lot of appreciation for for
[55:36] individual freedom. And now now it
[55:40] really feels like the exact opposite of
[55:42] uh of where I came from. But for a
[55:43] certain time in in let's say in the
[55:46] transition period there was some
[55:47] cognitive dissonance of thinking okay
[55:49] isn't this just some other movement uh
[55:52] promising some kind of nonsense? And a
[55:54] lot of people that are less familiar
[55:57] with it and haven't studied it enough
[55:58] will will call it that and will call it
[56:00] a cult and pointing to those those
[56:03] similarities, but they don't understand
[56:05] the base layer just yet. That's the way
[56:07] I see it. Yeah. And then and I guess the
[56:11] the thing that there's also
[56:13] no mastermind behind it.
[56:18] There in in the end of the day, it's
[56:21] just open source code. Yeah. with the
[56:23] with the religion I came from, there is
[56:25] literally this this committee of I don't
[56:27] know 10 or 12 mainly boomers somewhere
[56:30] in the US that kind of determine the the
[56:32] ideological direction. Uh it's it's
[56:36] almost like the Fed, you know,
[56:37] determining the the interest rate behind
[56:39] closed doors. They determine the the
[56:42] ideological direction. And if they uh if
[56:44] they if they make changes, then it's
[56:46] called new new light. They quote some
[56:48] kind of uh prophecy of Isaiah I think uh
[56:50] where it says that the light will will
[56:54] keep uh shining brighter and brighter
[56:56] and they say oh this is new light we got
[56:58] new inspiration and we're changing this
[57:00] and this and that and that was kind of
[57:02] also back then when I was still in the
[57:04] region that was also kind of cognitive
[57:05] dissonance for me thinking okay uh so
[57:08] everything we we preach and that we
[57:11] believe in now can be changed uh uh in
[57:14] in a few years when there is more a new
[57:17] light and we just uh like keep keep
[57:20] following it. So that was always kind of
[57:23] bit of a cognitive dissonance thing for
[57:25] for me back then and and that is what
[57:28] with Bitcoin. Okay. The the core like
[57:30] Satoshi himself said, the the core
[57:33] principles of the protocol were laid
[57:35] down and and and in uh in in stone with
[57:39] with the first version of of the Bitcoin
[57:41] protocol and nobody will be able to
[57:43] change it because there won't be there
[57:46] won't be consensus around that. Did you
[57:49] enter any other religion or any
[57:52] religious force around around that?
[57:55] Sorry, I I missed what you said. uh uh
[57:58] if if you entered any other religion or
[58:01] if you looked at like uh Buddhism,
[58:04] Hinduism, uh
[58:06] Christianity, anything like that. I uh
[58:09] I'm kind of agnostic in that sense. Uh
[58:11] right now, although I I like Buddhism
[58:14] where it's the the non non religious
[58:18] aspects of it. been listening lately to
[58:20] a lot of Ellen Ellen Watts and it it's
[58:22] kind of more of a way of dealing with
[58:25] life, dealing with stress and just being
[58:27] happy and and uh having the right
[58:31] attitude towards everything you see
[58:33] happening in in the world and your own
[58:35] place in in the universe so to speak. Uh
[58:38] but that is without religious rituals
[58:41] and and stuff like that. when it becomes
[58:43] organized religion in in temples and and
[58:47] uh yeah
[58:49] worshiping others then it's it's a no-go
[58:52] for me. So it's it's more of a yeah phil
[58:55] philosophical like eastern philosophy
[58:57] thing than than religion. Absolutely.
[59:01] Really cool. Um, I was just curious
[59:04] because I'm uh I'm not religious, but
[59:07] I've seen a lot of Christians like I see
[59:11] a big overlap between uh Bitcoiners and
[59:14] in Christianity, but there also a lot of
[59:17] other religions obviously in Bitcoin and
[59:19] obviously a lot of people that are
[59:21] completely out of religion. It's also a
[59:23] big group. Uh that's why I was was
[59:25] curious especially if someone that that
[59:28] switched through that. Um, I want to
[59:29] spend uh almost forgot about it. We
[59:32] should also talk about Bitcoin Prague
[59:34] and and what's what's coming 205. Um,
[59:38] and and and all that. Um, give us kind
[59:41] of like uh what what is PE what are
[59:45] people are waiting for for Bitcoin uh
[59:47] 205? What is kind of the program looking
[59:49] like and the conference? Yeah, on on the
[59:52] one hand it's going to be more of the
[59:54] same uh like we already discussed in
[59:57] terms of the quality of the event, the
[59:59] scale of the event, the vibe that is
[60:02] going to be just just as as good or even
[60:04] better as as uh people expected because
[60:07] we are iterating, we are improving. I
[60:10] mean we did we did a survey after last
[60:12] year's event uh that that I completely
[60:14] processed that also provided a lot of
[60:16] insights for small and big things that
[60:19] we uh that that we changed just to make
[60:21] the experience more pleasant and more
[60:23] more comfortable. Um in terms of program
[60:26] the the biggest change uh right now and
[60:30] we just launched that last last week so
[60:33] some people might might not be aware of
[60:34] that yet. Uh so in in the pre previous
[60:37] two editions in 23 and 24, the first day
[60:40] of the conference is is industry day. So
[60:43] that was just a day when it's more
[60:44] quiet. It's a slightly more expensive
[60:47] ticket and it's mainly for people that
[60:48] are already within the Bitcoin space
[60:51] that are working in the Bitcoin space or
[60:53] job hunting in the Bitcoin space. And uh
[60:55] before the big masses uh come in for the
[60:58] the general admission days, it's just
[61:00] more quiet networking. there aren't
[61:02] lines at the expo for the popular booths
[61:05] just to talk to to people from from from
[61:08] the big big companies. Um so that has
[61:11] been industry day in uh in the last two
[61:14] years mainly focused on the bitcoin
[61:17] industry but like we discussed the
[61:19] narrative around bitcoin is changing
[61:21] very fast with nation states with
[61:23] everything that is happening in the US
[61:24] with the ETFs and and things like that.
[61:27] Um and what we decided to do is to turn
[61:31] uh industry day into business day. Uh
[61:34] broadening the focus a lot more. Um and
[61:37] really focusing on I would call it three
[61:40] three audiences or three three groups.
[61:42] So we have like we like we discussed you
[61:45] have people that everyone in the Bitcoin
[61:48] space is interested in different
[61:49] aspects. We have you have the the sound
[61:51] money aspect, the freedom aspect, the
[61:52] technology aspect. There are also a lot
[61:55] of people that are really interested
[61:56] just in in Bitcoin from an investment
[61:58] standpoint and a and a macroeconomic
[62:01] standpoint. So for that that audience
[62:04] the the program during uh business day
[62:07] will be very interesting
[62:10] um uh because it's it's going to be
[62:12] completely focused on on businesses
[62:14] adopting Bitcoin with corporate uh
[62:17] treasuries with accepting Bitcoin with
[62:20] um uh financial arbitrage uh strategies
[62:24] or financial engineering. Um so for for
[62:29] people that are already in the Bitcoin
[62:30] space uh uh that are just in really
[62:33] interested in in that topic uh that
[62:36] realm of of topics uh it's going to be
[62:38] very interesting uh very uh very curated
[62:42] program. Um the the the the second one
[62:46] is people ah yeah I will just bring it
[62:50] up uh for for people to to see it uh
[62:53] next to to to what you're saying. Yeah.
[62:55] Yeah, more more information will be
[62:57] editable. Like I said, we we launched it
[62:59] just uh last week. Um and it's at this
[63:03] point it's it's actually easier to to
[63:05] access through uh through uh our social
[63:07] post, but more information will will be
[63:10] uh appearing on on the website soon. Um
[63:13] but the um the the second one is
[63:16] actually Bitcoiners kind of uh like like
[63:20] I used to be and maybe you as well uh
[63:23] already being a Bitcoiner but still
[63:24] having a fiat job. So you work at a at a
[63:27] a large or small company and you are the
[63:30] Bitcoiner in inside the company and
[63:32] maybe you have conversations at the
[63:34] coffee machine with people uh about
[63:36] Bitcoin. Uh and right now with all the
[63:39] positive narrative changes and the vibe
[63:42] shift that that we're noticing in in in
[63:44] the whole world uh in in markets um you
[63:47] see a potential or I think there's a
[63:49] potential for your company to do
[63:51] something with Bitcoin. So be it
[63:53] accepting bitcoin for products or
[63:55] services or some kind of corporate
[63:57] treasury uh policy uh or strategy uh but
[64:02] you you don't know how to go about it
[64:04] because in the past maybe people were
[64:06] laughing at at you or just not
[64:07] interested. So the whole program during
[64:10] business day will provide playbooks uh
[64:13] case studies uh best practices from
[64:16] companies that have already done that,
[64:18] people that have have already done that
[64:20] and I will provide you with yeah all the
[64:23] information you need to bring back to
[64:25] your company and say okay I was there
[64:28] and this is the these are the the gems
[64:30] or the pearls that uh that that that I
[64:32] got back and that will help uh help help
[64:35] our company. And then the last uh the
[64:39] last category are more yeah people who
[64:42] are not yet Bitcoiners that are becoming
[64:44] interested interested that are mid and
[64:46] senior level in in large corporations
[64:48] across Europe. The the big the big
[64:51] companies you have in in Germany and
[64:53] other other countries um that because of
[64:56] this whole narrative change are becoming
[64:58] interested in Bitcoin. they maybe have
[65:00] seen something about micro strategy or
[65:02] uh or about the ETFs and they understand
[65:05] that they at least need to understand
[65:08] this thing and and see what they can do
[65:10] with it. So, we're also reaching out to
[65:12] those audiences through through
[65:13] different channels obviously because
[65:14] they're not not bitcoiners yet. But
[65:17] bringing all these these bringing these
[65:19] three categories together with a highly
[65:21] curated program uh with uh the same good
[65:25] networking opportunities in the expo uh
[65:27] when it's still quiet before the general
[65:29] admission that is going to be the new
[65:31] concept or the new look of uh of what
[65:33] what used to be industry day. So, it's
[65:35] it's a completely different focus. uh
[65:38] and yeah like I said for for many uh
[65:41] many people both inside the Bitcoin
[65:43] space and a bit further away in in in
[65:46] the corporate realm uh it will be will
[65:48] be very interesting first day of of the
[65:50] conference and then obviously we have
[65:52] all the other uh things people are are
[65:55] used to that have already been to the
[65:57] conference uh in in terms of of the uh
[66:00] the program with side events um and and
[66:04] yeah everything else in during the the
[66:06] two days coming after that. So we
[66:08] definitely still have a big focus on the
[66:10] freedom aspect on open source technology
[66:13] on sound money. Uh so it's it's going to
[66:16] be a a really interesting mix of both
[66:19] attendees uh and and and topics.
[66:23] It's super interesting is also um I just
[66:26] want to because I get sometimes actually
[66:29] questions around that um uh people are
[66:33] thinking like oh should I get the expo
[66:35] or the conference pass? Should I get
[66:36] from the business pass or the VIP pass
[66:38] or like uh it doesn't make sense from
[66:40] the conference pass to go to the
[66:42] business pass? Um can can you maybe just
[66:45] just briefly um share for for for whom
[66:49] is is is what kind of uh pass meant
[66:53] meant to be? Uh from my understanding
[66:55] was always like okay conference is like
[66:57] for for most people if you want to have
[66:59] business connections also the business
[67:00] pass but how does also the expo and the
[67:02] the v pass uh get into the mix? Sure.
[67:06] Sure. Yeah. So, as you can see, the the
[67:09] cheapest uh option is the the expo pass.
[67:12] So, we have uh just for people who
[67:14] haven't been to BDC Prague, when you
[67:16] enter, it's two um two big holes. One is
[67:20] the main stage area where all the all
[67:23] the keynotes take place. Uh and then to
[67:25] to the right of of the lobby is the the
[67:27] expo. This they're the same size. Um and
[67:30] the expo is is where all the companies
[67:33] have their that are our partners have uh
[67:35] have their booths and uh with the expo
[67:39] pass you can you have access to the area
[67:42] outside. So there you have like uh
[67:43] sitting areas and food trucks things
[67:46] like that uh as well as the the the
[67:49] check stage. So there is a a stage
[67:51] outside in a in a tent with a program in
[67:53] in the Czech language. So this this pass
[67:55] was mainly created or this this was
[67:58] mainly uh added there for the the locals
[68:01] that are also new to new to Bitcoin. So
[68:04] for them obviously the threshold is is
[68:06] pretty low just to yeah if they're
[68:08] living in Prague just to come there for
[68:10] one or two days and and start their
[68:12] their journey. Uh but that that pass
[68:15] doesn't give you access to the uh to the
[68:18] conference hall where the the keynotes
[68:20] are taking place. So, if you want to see
[68:22] Michael Sailor or other other uh other
[68:25] speakers on on the main stage, uh you
[68:28] won't be able to uh to see those. There
[68:31] is a small expo stage in in the expo
[68:33] hall in in the corner with some smaller
[68:36] uh panels uh with with less seating
[68:38] area. So, people with the expo ticket
[68:40] also have access to that. But that's
[68:42] just a small part of the program. Then
[68:44] the conference pass gives you access to
[68:47] uh uh the the the full the full program
[68:52] uh including the the the keynotes in in
[68:54] the main stage mainstage area um uh plus
[68:59] uh the
[69:01] um or with the exception of of the
[69:04] business day what I just explained. So
[69:06] the those are the two general ad
[69:08] admission days. Um and the the first day
[69:12] on uh I think it's yeah Thursday the
[69:15] whole business program I just talked
[69:16] about. Yeah. So this is the page uh that
[69:18] that shows more information about about
[69:20] that. Um that is not included in in the
[69:23] conference pass. So if you're really
[69:25] like I said interested in that whole
[69:27] investments perspective or you really
[69:29] want to orange pill your the company
[69:31] where you're working and and you want to
[69:33] network with the uh yeah with the
[69:35] experts around that then uh the the
[69:38] business pass is the uh the best
[69:41] value. And then the last one in in the
[69:44] overview we just showed is the VIP pass
[69:46] which is all of the previous obviously
[69:48] with uh the best catering what many
[69:52] people call the best catering of any any
[69:53] Bitcoin conferences upstairs where you
[69:56] have exclusive networking with all the
[69:58] speakers all the partners um uh so that
[70:03] is yeah yet another uh another level on
[70:06] on top of it that's the the best
[70:07] experience if only the best is good
[70:10] enough for you you want to have like the
[70:12] the best uh experience contour service
[70:14] and and things like that with uh full
[70:17] catering throughout the uh the entire
[70:19] event uh then uh then you you should
[70:21] take the the VIP bus. So that's kind of
[70:23] the breakdown. Really cool. Thank you so
[70:26] much. Uh now I have a short clip that I
[70:29] can send to people.
[70:31] Yeah, exactly asking. And and you saw
[70:33] you saw the label there, the Expo
[70:35] tickets because they okay they are the
[70:37] cheapest uh they they are selling out
[70:39] pretty pretty quickly. So it's I don't
[70:41] know exactly when when they will sell
[70:42] out but we have we have sold a big chunk
[70:44] of them already. So uh yeah people
[70:48] should be aware of that because yeah as
[70:49] soon as they their number is is kept. So
[70:53] at a certain point they they sell out
[70:54] and and then the lowest tier is uh is
[70:56] the conference ticket that is available.
[70:59] I've I I heard that so many times that
[71:03] people call other conferences out and
[71:06] saying like, "Oh, the tickets are so
[71:08] expensive. I cannot afford that." I
[71:10] really appreciate that with Bitcoin
[71:12] Prague that they that you give a ticket
[71:16] that is um on with under €100. Even the
[71:20] conference pass I think is is quite
[71:22] affordable, €300. Um but but but people
[71:26] uh see sometimes tickets prices of like
[71:29] 600 700 euros where it starts and then
[71:31] like going into the thousands and
[71:33] they're like okay I read stay at home
[71:35] and and stacks. So so I think it's it's
[71:39] really cool to have like an entry level
[71:42] um uh where yes you don't get the the
[71:45] the speak speakers on on the main stage.
[71:48] You don't get a lot of other things.
[71:50] Obviously it's is a lot less money and
[71:52] this all those things cost something but
[71:55] uh having that option is something I
[71:57] love about Bitcoin Prague. Yeah. Yeah.
[72:00] That's great, great to hear. And that is
[72:02] consciously because in in my Fiat job in
[72:04] in the past, I used to be an events
[72:06] organization as well in in the marine
[72:08] industry organizing the uh the big
[72:10] orange Holland pavilions, also orange,
[72:13] but the the Holland pavilions on trade
[72:16] shows all all over the world uh for the
[72:18] the Dutch ship building industry. And
[72:21] with these kind of professional
[72:22] conferences and trade shows, you have
[72:24] this, you also have pretty expensive
[72:26] tickets and everyone going there or
[72:27] almost everyone going there is is
[72:29] working in that space. So their employer
[72:31] is paying. So it doesn't doesn't matter
[72:33] that much. And actually you usually
[72:36] don't have that that cheaper ticket
[72:38] option because they want to keep out the
[72:39] the ordinary people that are just
[72:41] interested in watching ships or whatever
[72:43] the conference is about and keeping the
[72:45] students out. they're just there to uh
[72:48] to get the free free giveaways. Um, and
[72:51] with BDC Prague, because like like we
[72:53] said, we're not just it's not not just a
[72:56] bit a business, it's also a mission. Uh,
[72:59] we consciously want to make it
[73:01] accessible also for the plebs that are
[73:03] not working in this space that have a
[73:05] limited uh limited money to to spend.
[73:09] Uh, and and that is really part of the
[73:11] mission, the educational part. And then
[73:13] that that also makes it completely
[73:14] different compared to just ordinary
[73:17] business in in other industries.
[73:20] Uh two small things I want to add. I I
[73:22] love that you give a discount uh not
[73:25] only to creators like me. If you use
[73:27] code Robin you get 10% but you also get
[73:29] discounts when you pay in Bitcoin. I I
[73:31] love that incentive structure of like
[73:33] hey if you spend a ticket. Yeah. So if
[73:35] you use the code Robin and pay in
[73:37] Bitcoin you you get 15% uh discount in
[73:39] in total. That's that's that's really
[73:42] awesome. And then then the export
[73:44] ticket. I mean uh I don't know when the
[73:47] podcast will go out. Maybe the prices
[73:50] are then then a little bit higher but
[73:52] the price hikes are probably not as
[73:54] significant. Uh so so the prices will
[73:57] probably end of the month. So the prices
[73:59] will go up first of May. 1st of May. So
[74:03] uh so then uh the prices when this is
[74:06] when you're listening to this and then
[74:07] it's the first day of release uh the
[74:09] prices will still be the same as on the
[74:11] screen. Yeah. Okay. Great. Really cool.
[74:14] Uh that that's awesome uh that we got
[74:17] that breakdown. Uh we we have one
[74:19] question that I ask each and every one
[74:20] of my guests and the question is what
[74:22] can we learn from you besides
[74:26] Bitcoin? Um yeah, what can you learn
[74:30] from me besides
[74:31] Bitcoin? Uh that freedom is is the most
[74:34] important thing. Maybe not not everyone
[74:38] realizes that so much but that's my
[74:40] background that we've spoken about that
[74:42] freedom is uh is really the most
[74:44] important thing even I can say now from
[74:46] a health perspective uh it's uh it's not
[74:50] be not being free and we none of us are
[74:53] entirely free because we still have to
[74:56] pay taxes we still have to show our
[74:57] passport at a border and they can still
[75:00] uh they can still uh refuse us. So no
[75:03] one is 100% free uh unfortunately but uh
[75:07] having having lived 40 years in uh not
[75:10] not being free uh I I can even say from
[75:13] personal experience that it is a huge
[75:14] impact on on health uh and h happiness
[75:17] in in general. So uh cherish uh what
[75:21] what you have and uh use bitcoin to uh
[75:24] to improve and increase your freedom. I
[75:27] love that so much. Really really cool.
[75:29] So it's still Bitcoin related. Sorry,
[75:31] but that's kind of that's kind of uh
[75:33] yeah, my story.
[75:35] Uh it's it's funny. Uh there's almost no
[75:38] guest that gives in that answer an
[75:42] answer where there's no Bitcoin. The
[75:44] word not circling back to Bitcoin. So So
[75:46] it's it's like it's it's really hard for
[75:49] for Bitcoin speakers to not talk about
[75:51] Bitcoin. That's kind of my take away. I
[75:53] I'm I'm not like I mean if someone is a
[75:55] talented guitar player or something they
[75:57] can answer okay you I can teach you how
[75:59] to play the guitar you know but it's I I
[76:01] don't have that kind of talent so uh
[76:03] yeah those were my two cent my two cent
[76:07] I I love that um we have entertain in
[76:09] the podcast where the previous guest is
[76:11] asking a question for the next guest
[76:13] without knowing who the next guest is
[76:14] and the previous guest asked the
[76:17] previous guest asked you an really
[76:18] interesting uh question um if you would
[76:23] fast forward now 10 years and 10 years
[76:27] uh Bitcoin would have had failed. Why
[76:31] would it have failed? Okay. I think
[76:34] recently I I just yesterday or the day
[76:38] before yesterday the same question was
[76:39] asked to Jack Dorsey I think. Yeah,
[76:42] exactly. This was his inspiration. Yeah,
[76:45] it was his inspiration for the for the
[76:47] answer. And I think if I remember
[76:48] correctly, his answer was Bitcoin not
[76:50] becoming a medium of exchange.
[76:53] Yeah, that that was his his answers.
[76:55] It's it's funny enough, Jeff Boof was
[76:57] also on the podcast just a few episodes
[76:59] ago, and he said the same thing. He's
[77:01] like, if Bitcoin fails to be a medium
[77:04] exchange, the store of value won't
[77:07] matter.
[77:08] Yeah, I I I tend to agree. Uh but the
[77:11] question is timing. Do we does it have
[77:14] to become like a generally a generally
[77:17] usable medium of exchange
[77:20] uh without the the yeah the current
[77:22] difficulties there are still with second
[77:24] second layers um uh within 5 years or 10
[77:29] years okay you said 10
[77:31] years I I but I tend tend to agree that
[77:34] that obviously medium of exchange has
[77:36] has to become uh ubiquitous and and as
[77:39] as easy as uh as anything else is
[77:42] sending sending a signal message and and
[77:45] to some to some po to some point we
[77:48] already are there. I I always bring that
[77:51] example of people that listen a lot to
[77:53] podcasts maybe are sick of it but I I
[77:55] will bring it up again. Um I get paid in
[77:57] Bitcoin from uh some of uh my sponsors
[78:00] and I pay some of my post-production
[78:04] members in Bitcoin. So actually um a
[78:07] large and large amount of my total cash
[78:10] flow uh for my business for my
[78:12] podcasting business is already now in
[78:15] Bitcoin and it's way easier in that way
[78:19] because for example um uh with with
[78:22] Bitcoin Prague it wouldn't be that big
[78:24] of a problem because they are in in
[78:27] Europe and there's the the money
[78:29] transfer easy but with another sponsor
[78:31] for example uh with coin vigilante they
[78:34] in America and going and doing that is
[78:37] is is with a lot more um uh fees and a
[78:41] lot more hustle involved and then uh the
[78:45] interesting uh thing uh is uh also
[78:50] paying is way easier. You just have one
[78:53] address and you just like basically have
[78:55] a number and and you you you send it
[78:57] there. uh and uh if you do it anything
[79:00] else you have to have like an inside
[79:02] where a number the routing numbers and
[79:04] everything else you have to put in
[79:05] there. So it's it's fascinating how much
[79:09] easier it's already now for remittance
[79:12] uh to pay in Bitcoin and uh now to pay
[79:16] for coffee and burger and and and beer
[79:19] and and small stuff that we will figure
[79:21] that out. I'm I'm I'm fairly certain
[79:23] that that and the challenge there is
[79:25] that it that it's in a non-custodial and
[79:27] decentralized way uh not not creating
[79:30] decentralized uh entities on on a second
[79:33] layer basically becoming the the the new
[79:36] banking banking infrastructure of of of
[79:38] Bitcoin cuz then then there is there are
[79:41] still going to be uh gatekeepers. I
[79:43] think that's that's obviously the uh the
[79:45] biggest challenge uh and and the the
[79:47] scalability because what you are doing
[79:49] now and with BDC Prague also many
[79:51] suppliers and sponsors and and
[79:54] contractor are contractors are pay
[79:56] paying or being paid in in bitcoin which
[79:58] is is is convenient
[80:01] um but uh that wouldn't be possible I
[80:04] think right right now if the entire
[80:06] world was was trying to do that so there
[80:08] has to be an evolution there and like
[80:12] yeah in in in 10 years. Let's hope we we
[80:15] obviously are there. There are some some
[80:17] hurdles there technically. Uh but I'm
[80:20] pretty confident that that that we'll
[80:21] we'll get there. I mean there is
[80:23] obviously there is lightning but there
[80:25] are also other alternative uh approaches
[80:28] that are being developed and and worked
[80:30] on and uh I think in in in 10 years I'm
[80:34] I'm pretty confident that that we'll
[80:36] will uh will be there that the the the
[80:39] base layer and and the infrastructure on
[80:41] on top of it will will be ready ready to
[80:43] handle handle basically anything.
[80:45] Absolutely to totally agree. and and
[80:48] then and then it's the medium exchange
[80:51] plus uh store of of value and then then
[80:54] you really you really have have the have
[80:57] the potential to to go towards hyper
[80:59] bitcoinization.
[81:01] Awesome. This was an uh really cool
[81:04] episode of you. Thanks so much, Michael.
[81:07] Before I let you go, before I let you
[81:09] go, um we already showed the Bitcoin
[81:11] Prague website. Uh I think it's just uh
[81:14] ptcprag.com.
[81:16] uh easy zoom uh it's anyways uh in in
[81:19] the description as your partner um where
[81:22] can people find uh you personally and
[81:24] and uh do you also have have online
[81:26] profiles? Uh do I also have online
[81:29] profiles? Oh, online profiles. Yeah, of
[81:31] course. Um so people people can find me
[81:34] uh most easily on on X um at Michael and
[81:38] then R O E R A D E.
[81:42] Uh, and yeah, that's probably the
[81:44] easiest for for your uh your audience.
