[00:00] I saw when the Bitcoin law came into
[00:02] effect I saw that as a first sign of
[00:04] that things were changing and changing
[00:06] for the first time in 2013 years 2019
[00:09] elor insecure dangerous not many people
[00:12] wanted to come back 2024 El solor more
[00:15] people are coming back every day Bitcoin
[00:16] is Illegal Tender currency the country
[00:18] is six it's been a really really big
[00:20] paradigm shift in say 70% of the country
[00:23] doesn't have a bank account it's like
[00:25] the the Trojan Horse they're not going
[00:27] to be able to stop it you're seeing more
[00:29] businesses move move from not only
[00:31] accepting Bitcoin but also holding the
[00:33] Bitcoin and not converting it directly
[00:35] to Fiat which is extremely great to see
[00:38] they're buying every single every single
[00:40] day the experience paying with the
[00:42] lightning is above and beyond any other
[00:44] experience paying with any other
[00:46] [Music]
[00:50] method then moved out and came back or
[00:53] how how was it yeah so I I lived in Sol
[00:56] my whole life up until high school after
[00:59] I finished high school I went to study
[01:01] abroad and in Boston and it's I
[01:07] graduated worked in energy little bit
[01:09] but was a bitcoiner since like 2016
[01:13] 2017 um then uh it's the basically I
[01:19] went to like the Bitcoin conference in
[01:20] Miami and just to see right and then uh
[01:25] at the end of the conference boo sudden
[01:28] comes out and says like oh bigcoin is
[01:29] now legal tender what just happened
[01:32] right um that was a huge uh that was a
[01:36] huge shot I never thought I was ever
[01:39] gonna happen in Salvador or that I was
[01:42] gonna end up coming back
[01:45] and but I'm glad I came back I was able
[01:48] to come back for some to do something
[01:49] that I liked right not often in third
[01:53] third world countries at least that can
[01:55] say that something is going on for the
[01:57] first time over there that isn't happen
[01:59] happening anywhere else oh May did
[02:02] Bitcoin made you come back or was it the
[02:06] policies that nuk
[02:08] implemented so first it was Bitcoin it's
[02:11] the I saw when when the Bitcoin law came
[02:15] into effect I saw that as a first sign
[02:18] of things that things were changing it's
[02:22] and changing for the first time in uh 23
[02:27] years that I was a Salvadorian up until
[02:29] the
[02:30] it's so I saw that as a positive sign
[02:33] it's and after that the policies that B
[02:37] has been
[02:38] implementing ER in those same 23 years I
[02:42] I've never felt safer than I
[02:45] have like up until now before throughout
[02:48] my whole time that I lived in Al
[02:50] Salvador couldn't go to the beaches you
[02:52] couldn't go to small towns and cities
[02:55] around you'd be scared like if it was a
[02:58] night that you get robbed or assaulted
[03:00] or something it's the so I would say it
[03:04] was a combination of combination of both
[03:07] it's because when I came back Sol was
[03:09] still a little bit uh dangerous and uh
[03:13] that changed you know
[03:16] it's interesting um maybe let's let's
[03:21] paint a little bit of a picture for
[03:22] people that didn't knew El Salvador
[03:25] before and also maybe they weren't there
[03:28] uh till now how different is El Salvador
[03:33] 2019 uh versus El Salvador now 2094
[03:37] almost 20195 so so for example before o
[03:41] Salvador was a place that was recognized
[03:44] by its uh by its violence I would tell
[03:47] anyone I knew hey you want to come back
[03:50] to a Sol with me like my friends in
[03:52] college and they'd be like oh my parents
[03:53] don't let me right um it's it's a
[03:56] dangerous country they asked me if I had
[03:59] bodyguards didn't and stuff like that um
[04:03] and so there was a whole perspective it
[04:05] was a completely different perspective
[04:07] abroad and even for myself I never
[04:10] thought I was ever going to come back I
[04:11] didn't want to come back to Al um the
[04:14] whole purpose of going to like an
[04:16] American school here was to uh study
[04:19] abroad keep on living abroad because uh
[04:22] was unless you had like a family
[04:24] business there really wasn't the many
[04:27] reasons to come back you know but but uh
[04:30] I think all of that was due to the
[04:31] insecurity so 2019 insecure uh dangerous
[04:37] the not many people wanted to come back
[04:39] 2024 El Sol more people are coming back
[04:43] every day Bitcoin is il legal tender
[04:45] currency the country is safe know so
[04:48] it's been a really really big paradigm
[04:51] shift and now my friends that we're
[04:53] telling me Oh my parents don't let me
[04:55] come they're asking me oh when can I go
[04:57] visit interesting yeah I was in
[05:00] uh not even a month ago and it was
[05:02] really nice like I didn't have I didn't
[05:05] felt any danger at all uh while I was
[05:08] there it felt really secure uh it was
[05:11] always nice people treated uh treated
[05:13] you good uh so there there was not even
[05:16] any aggression there was not not any
[05:18] they were very open uh to me they were
[05:20] very welcoming to me so it's a nice
[05:23] country now obviously I never visited
[05:26] before that it was my first time ever in
[05:28] a Salvador uh but yeah right now it's
[05:31] just an it's just it's a good country to
[05:33] to at least
[05:35] visit to your point that people nowadays
[05:37] are more open that's something I've
[05:39] noticed as well before like my time in
[05:43] high school here you you'd go up and
[05:45] talk with someone like random person you
[05:47] didn't know on the street or someone
[05:49] else and they'd act they'd respond like
[05:52] in a little bit of a sort of defensive
[05:54] way cuz they didn't know who you were
[05:57] and I didn't know who they were
[06:00] so there was like a little bit of um
[06:03] it's the not conflict but like tension
[06:06] i' say pretty average conversations just
[06:10] because the country was so insecure but
[06:11] nowadays as you were saying like you can
[06:13] talk with anyone and it's all super
[06:16] super chill you know I know nowadays
[06:19] nobody is going to wants to harm me and
[06:22] people know that I don't want to harm
[06:24] anyone either so it's I think that's
[06:26] allowed for
[06:27] more a open
[06:30] amongst the country right absolutely
[06:33] yeah and what are you now doing in El
[06:37] Salvador so I work at Ibex uh we're a
[06:40] Bitcoin lightning Network company and we
[06:43] also uh provide liquidity to bitcoin and
[06:46] digital asset companies and also and in
[06:50] gual it's so I'm the I'm the regional
[06:54] manager for Central America for the
[06:57] operations on on regional manager have
[06:59] to think about the office and mic
[07:03] Scot the what oh you don't know about uh
[07:07] the office oh yeah the office yeah yeah
[07:09] yeah yeah I'm the Michael I'm the
[07:11] Michael Scott yeah Michael Scott is is
[07:16] the regional manager I I watch that
[07:19] episode that series too much and every
[07:22] time someone says regional manager it's
[07:26] I
[07:26] just it comes up in my in my trade
[07:29] really cool so you try to help uh uh get
[07:33] lightning and get me of exchange
[07:35] basically the currency use of Bitcoin in
[07:38] El Salvador better how has it actually
[07:40] been in El Salvador to use lightning to
[07:43] use uh Bitcoin as payments so we started
[07:46] you know solor in 2021 we actually
[07:50] already had plans to expand to solor
[07:52] before the Bitcoin law was announced so
[07:55] we were already in the process of
[07:56] opening up the company and we were I
[07:59] think the second company to get the
[08:02] Bitcoin license after Cho is the and uh
[08:06] we started off with a payment processor
[08:09] called IEX pay ER so the first thing we
[08:13] realized was okay bit everybody will get
[08:15] $30 of Bitcoin and no business has any
[08:19] way of uh accepting there isn't a
[08:22] payment taas here uh and since Lightning
[08:25] Back Then was sort of a it was already
[08:28] in development but it was kind of of a
[08:29] new technology no big
[08:32] companies had it integrated before it's
[08:35] so we developed our own POS solution set
[08:38] up a cluster of nodes for the lightning
[08:42] infrastructure and created IEX pay is
[08:46] however uh we knew that businesses an no
[08:48] solor many of them wouldn't want to keep
[08:51] uh Bitcoin at least not yet um and they
[08:56] would want instant conversion to dollars
[08:58] so we plug we put that in together with
[09:01] the lightning payment processor and we
[09:03] were helping
[09:05] businesses like Starbucks when these KFC
[09:08] Pizza Hut
[09:10] Subway omnisport Crown Plaza it's the
[09:15] Holly they in take all of their Bitcoin
[09:18] be able to accept payments with Bitcoin
[09:21] over the lightning network with instant
[09:24] convertibility to US dollars in their
[09:26] local yeah H how deep is is Bitcoin
[09:30] already used as a as a currency in in
[09:33] Salvador I would say every every year on
[09:37] year we we've seen like a 10% year-
[09:41] on-ear growth at least on on
[09:43] transactions coming into RX spay is the
[09:47] we have some part of the market however
[09:49] there's a lot of other platforms out
[09:51] there which we don't have numbers for
[09:54] but I I can tell you it's
[09:56] increasing er every month uh the use of
[10:00] it as a currency um so I think something
[10:05] that that's changed nowadays that you
[10:09] can use the lightning as a rails as a
[10:13] payment rail for a ftech company or for
[10:15] a wallet so for example you can be using
[10:18] lightning to to move value between point
[10:21] a and point B without knowing you're
[10:23] using Bitcoin or going through lightning
[10:26] I think that's what uh that's what's
[10:28] needed for adoption to
[10:30] become greater right for example there's
[10:34] wallets where you can have like a a
[10:37] balance in dollars like strike for
[10:40] example where or dto Banks and you can
[10:44] use uh when a lightning payment shows up
[10:47] you can scan it and it take debits from
[10:49] the dollar balance sends it and pays it
[10:52] and the user never knew he was using
[10:54] lightning or that I went through Bitcoin
[10:56] and stuff like that um for example in Al
[11:00] Sol say 70% of the country doesn't have
[11:03] a bank account and 70% of the country I
[11:07] would say more or less makes the minimum
[11:09] wage which is around 3 300 350 a month
[11:13] so many of them don't have the capacity
[11:16] to for example save in Bitcoin but if if
[11:20] you give them access to a wallet uh uh
[11:23] digital transaction method ER which is
[11:27] using Bitcoin uh but the have a
[11:29] dollarized they will most likely start
[11:33] uh using it okay interesting and uh I
[11:36] think that's really important to have uh
[11:40] to integrate Bitcoin as deep as possible
[11:43] also with the fear currencies right now
[11:45] uh to have that hybrid system where
[11:47] people can just uh choose where what
[11:49] they use and it it doesn't it's not a
[11:52] difference for them if they have dollars
[11:55] or Bitcoin and they can just see what
[11:58] what fits best and I think if we have a
[12:00] flexible system that incorporates the
[12:03] field system for now it's it's really
[12:05] good to push Bitcoin in there uh and
[12:08] have a better and stronger ecosystem
[12:11] down the road and then once we are we're
[12:14] ready we we can get rid of the feed
[12:16] system
[12:17] hopefully yeah it's like the the Trojan
[12:20] Horse right yeah they're not going to be
[12:23] able to stop it eventually um but one
[12:26] thing I can tell you that I've seen is
[12:30] um businesses before they wanted to keep
[12:33] dollars at the start but over the last
[12:36] three years I'm I've been getting calls
[12:38] from
[12:39] clients uh that tell me hey like I want
[12:41] to keep it all at
[12:43] Bitcoin you know the price does help a
[12:45] lot in in making that par paradigm shift
[12:50] and uh we besides the transactional
[12:53] aspect so we actually for example for
[12:56] the payment processor we charge less
[12:59] if they keep it in Bitcoin it's the so
[13:02] as so as as an incentive for them to
[13:05] keep it in Bitcoin uh and I try to push
[13:07] them to keep it on bitcoin it's so
[13:10] besides the transactional part of of our
[13:13] business which we make commissions from
[13:16] each uh transaction we want our clients
[13:20] to keep uh keep Bitcoin we want them to
[13:22] have self custody of their
[13:26] funds a lot of what we do here in
[13:28] Salvador are real estate transactions
[13:30] for bitcoiners that are coming in to buy
[13:32] property and stuff like that the seller
[13:35] usually says oh I want uh I want to keep
[13:38] all of it in dollars classic and as so
[13:42] for example there's a property that we
[13:44] sold recently where it took one year the
[13:47] payments are made throughout a year and
[13:50] at the start of the year I told them
[13:52] well we gave them a free treasure just
[13:55] for the transactional purposes so they
[13:57] could see the Bitcoin coming in so they
[13:59] could verify it on the blockchain if
[14:01] they wanted to convert it they would
[14:03] send it to us and and they said I'm I'm
[14:06] going to convert all of it I'm like okay
[14:08] that's fine but you're going to have
[14:09] your own wallet um so anyways throughout
[14:12] the year over the last let's say two
[14:14] months ago it told me hey I actually
[14:16] want to keep part of this payment
[14:19] Bitcoin it was a substantial payment and
[14:23] uh I was very happy you know I didn't
[14:25] charge anything for that but uh they
[14:27] kept it in Bitcoin and now it's it's
[14:30] appreciated more than having all of that
[14:33] I mean they made in the last month what
[14:35] they would have made with all the other
[14:37] funds sitting in the bank for a whole
[14:38] year you know and I think that's that's
[14:41] how people are going to start uh getting
[14:44] it and talking among themselves and
[14:47] things like that for
[14:49] businesses for example we have clients
[14:52] in their payment processor and I have
[14:54] kept Bitcoin just Bitcoin since the
[14:57] start right the since they didn't
[14:59] represent a meaningful part of their
[15:02] operations that they needed to pay with
[15:04] dollars or cash they they just kept it
[15:07] in Bitcoin nowadays they've done between
[15:10] 5 to 7x profits in like that's how much
[15:15] their financials have improved just
[15:16] keeping it in bco by now you know
[15:20] um so
[15:23] yeah absolutely interesting so so you're
[15:26] seeing more businesses move from um not
[15:30] only accepting Bitcoin but also holding
[15:32] the Bitcoin and not converting it
[15:33] directly to uh Fiat which is extremely
[15:37] great to see that they are incentivized
[15:38] to do that uh and I think in general
[15:41] getting paid in Bitcoin is something
[15:44] magical especially if you live in El
[15:46] Salo where there are no capital gain
[15:47] stxs and you can just use Bitcoin as a
[15:50] medium of
[15:51] exchange yeah so here here that's a big
[15:55] benefit for example Bitcoin goes up in
[15:57] value no cap gains so that's that's
[16:01] excellent um since it's local tender
[16:05] legal tender currency locally um you
[16:08] could argue there's other
[16:10] benefits ER tax-wise and stuff like that
[16:13] like for buy property um yeah getting PA
[16:17] in Bitcoin here is the when there's no
[16:19] capital gains is excellent I mean you
[16:22] get C tax capital gains on any other
[16:25] sort of investment you do except that
[16:29] right so that's already 10% savings on
[16:30] whatever you make um and that's
[16:34] something that I I tell and I tell
[16:37] business is look um sometimes it's com
[16:41] really big companies that are going to
[16:42] receive one payment of like
[16:45] 10K and doesn't repres much to them and
[16:47] I tell them look like keep it in Bitcoin
[16:50] is a treasury strategy um keep it for
[16:54] more than one year
[16:56] Etc and uh they did listen before but
[16:59] now they're calling me it's like hey
[17:01] like I want actually want to open a
[17:03] wallet you know what can I do I'm happy
[17:06] to help of course but uh I think it
[17:10] takes example it's very easy to
[17:13] overestimate what can happen in three
[17:16] years and underestimate what can to
[17:18] happen in 10 I think that's something
[17:21] that's been one of the most important
[17:23] lessons here because publicly like
[17:26] around the world everybody's been say
[17:28] like news Outlet come with new saying
[17:31] oh Bitcoin experiment failed and it's no
[17:35] this is going to it's going to take some
[17:37] time it's things don't happen from the
[17:39] day to the night and now I think we're
[17:41] starting to see the First with all these
[17:43] companies that want to keep Bitcoin
[17:45] we're starting to see the first results
[17:47] of that also Sal's Bitcoin portfolio is
[17:50] up
[17:52] 120% that's you know for a third world
[17:56] country that that is a incredible I mean
[17:59] it's outperformed any other type of
[18:02] investment absolutely it's interesting
[18:04] it's also um it's very true what you say
[18:07] most people completely overestimate what
[18:08] can happen in the short term like one
[18:10] two three years and they underestimate
[18:12] what can happen in like 5 10 15 20 years
[18:16] uh from now on um because it's just such
[18:19] just such a high time like just go back
[18:23] 15 years Bitcoin wasn't even
[18:25] there and and now we have countries
[18:28] adopting it so fast forward another 15
[18:30] 20 years uh will be interesting where we
[18:33] end up um where do you see as Salvador
[18:37] as a country developing in 5 10 years so
[18:42] for example Bitcoin wise I think it will
[18:44] be a it's a great example to neighboring
[18:48] countries and other third third third
[18:51] world developing nations what can be
[18:54] achieved by having adopting a Bitcoin
[18:56] strategy Bitcoin treasury strategy
[18:59] and also being uh so for example here um
[19:04] all Bitcoin companies are regulated and
[19:06] digital asset companies so anything
[19:08] that's not Bitcoin are also
[19:10] regulated which is going to come
[19:12] eventually to all countries right every
[19:15] country is going to start over seeing
[19:16] regulating Bitcoin companies so I think
[19:19] we already have a head a big head start
[19:21] uh here as to what a tropicalized uh
[19:24] regulation will look like um as to 5
[19:28] years in advance Bitcoin does what it's
[19:30] supposed to do I think could be looking
[19:34] completely very different than it is
[19:36] today in a positive sense even even
[19:39] better right uh it's an Bitcoin itself
[19:42] is is an
[19:44] economic and has proven to be an
[19:46] economic miracle for the country already
[19:48] you know in uh two two and a half years
[19:52] we've been buying Bitcoin it's three
[19:55] years actually um and I think if it
[19:59] twice that amount of time it can
[20:03] definitely do something like that how
[20:06] big of a factor is n p in in El Salvador
[20:10] for for that future growth I would say
[20:13] for
[20:14] example he he he's going to be a big uh
[20:17] influence in that so to give a little
[20:19] context before used to be two parties a
[20:23] left uh left wing party and a right wing
[20:25] party it was basically 50 50 like that
[20:30] each of them had 20 years in power over
[20:33] the last like 40 years all of them stole
[20:36] a ton of money is the and never did
[20:39] anything different they just wanted to
[20:41] be power right um
[20:45] it's and ever since B came into Power
[20:48] every the country has done has undergone
[20:52] a parad shift a paradigm shift economic
[20:55] a paradigm shift in PR so people don't
[20:58] look at us Sol the way they used to
[21:00] before uh we have I would say respect
[21:03] and not
[21:05] even talking about Al Salvador but also
[21:08] like I now feel prouder to be a
[21:11] Salvadoran like people come up to me and
[21:13] ask me about Al Salvador and that's like
[21:16] when you make somebody
[21:18] feel important or or empowered that that
[21:21] also brings everything everyone else up
[21:24] so I want to do good things for a Sol
[21:27] now right I've always wanted to but I
[21:29] want to do it more now than before right
[21:33] um it's and so going back to to to the
[21:38] political part bukel has done an
[21:39] excellent job making the country secure
[21:43] implementing he's also going going to be
[21:45] bringing in nuclear of which I'm a big
[21:47] advocate for it's the and all of these
[21:51] things I never thought were going to

[24:09] sovereignty and uh from what I
[24:13] understand he cannot um be reelected in
[24:17] 2029 or is that something that he could
[24:20] change and he could uh be reelected uh
[24:24] of the end of his period so in talker
[24:26] Carlon interview that uh that he was in
[24:29] he said that he wasn't going to run for
[24:31] for president again but I still think
[24:34] for example he has a lot of there's a
[24:36] lot of relevant influence he's going to
[24:38] have uh even if he's not even if he
[24:43] doesn't run for example he still going
[24:44] to have very relevant influence if and
[24:48] I'm sure whoever he he runs like for his
[24:51] party was going to do an excellent job
[24:54] you know but he can also can also not be
[24:57] president and be
[24:58] there's no laws against being an
[25:03] advisor so I think that's going
[25:05] to it's going to continue it's
[25:10] and some people think that he's going to
[25:12] become like uh the mayor of Bitcoin City
[25:15] or something like that that would be
[25:17] awesome um but yeah um and just to also
[25:23] on the political side of things for
[25:26] example uh let's say
[25:29] uncles of mine that are 70 years old
[25:31] were the rightwing party and they're
[25:32] like oh uh I don't like Bitcoin Bitcoin
[25:35] is bad whatever they told me
[25:38] that Bitcoin exists because of the
[25:41] cartel like you work with a cartel what
[25:44] are you talking
[25:45] about right um so it's they don't like
[25:50] Bitcoin they don't like Bou because it's
[25:54] the um it's simply a completely
[25:57] different age I told I him like what do
[25:58] you think what do you think about the
[26:01] internet when it came out he's like oh
[26:03] uh I don't
[26:04] know the conversation
[26:07] finished but um yeah that's super
[26:11] interesting uh it's it's also
[26:13] interesting because usually in the more
[26:16] right leaning political landscape
[26:19] Bitcoin is more accepted than the left
[26:22] leaning uh there so just for me to
[26:25] understand is like there are two big
[26:27] parties
[26:28] Salvador and uh nuk is is is is his own
[26:34] party or like how does this work oh oh
[26:36] sorry I forgot to say that so both
[26:39] parties left and right in the right word
[26:41] so after they were in power both it's
[26:44] the bu made his own party Bia was
[26:48] actually I think he spent some time in
[26:51] either of the parties but it never
[26:52] worked out uh because there were 7even
[26:56] year olds telling him like no you can't
[26:58] do that or you're too young or whatever
[27:01] after a while of that you need to do
[27:04] some you need to do something different
[27:05] if you want if you want things to change
[27:07] and that's what he did um he created his
[27:11] own party know he has and uh got the
[27:14] support one the election by like
[27:16] Landslide and yeah interesting so he he
[27:20] actually creaded his own party um and
[27:23] and won the election that that's that's
[27:26] huge that that's something that's
[27:27] Unthinkable in America right now yeah
[27:31] but but the the the initial position was
[27:35] similar to what it's now in America
[27:37] where there's big two two big parties
[27:40] and and uh a bunch of small ones but
[27:43] they don't really
[27:44] matter yeah it was exactly exactly like
[27:48] that I think people like for for that to
[27:51] happen people need to be be f up with
[27:54] both uh that's I think probably that's
[27:57] what happen here people people were fed
[28:00] up um we look at our history of
[28:04] presidents every single one of them has
[28:06] been
[28:07] like has stolen a t ton of money or in
[28:13] jail that's that's been her history for
[28:15] far too long interesting um I also heard
[28:18] that his brother might take over I I
[28:23] hadn't heard that before I I had I heard
[28:26] a lot of interesting theories around n
[28:28] PUK it's it's it's super interesting
[28:30] because um like Max Kaiser for example
[28:33] runs around with n PUK
[28:35] 2029 with this cap of like he will he
[28:39] will run again uh then I heard neuk
[28:43] might switch over to a higher level of
[28:46] like trying to work together in Central
[28:49] America between more countries that was
[28:52] an interesting thing and the other thing
[28:54] that I heard is the is Prada is taking
[28:56] over I have no clue what uh if that's
[28:59] just a f if there's anything to it but
[29:03] it seems like he's extremely popular uh
[29:06] and it seems like he can do even more in
[29:10] five years with uh El salador or with um
[29:16] Central America maybe on a bigger scale
[29:18] I don't know yeah I definitely agree
[29:21] with that it's he's extremely popular
[29:24] and I I go to Guatemala a lot my brother
[29:27] lives over there
[29:29] and and my two beautiful nieces and
[29:34] this um whenever I go to goal I get an
[29:37] Uber and they ask me oh where are you
[29:38] from and I'm from Al Sol oh na he's
[29:42] awesome like we want him to come over
[29:44] here I've had that happen to me like 10
[29:46] times already in guala just randomly
[29:49] every every time I say from oh like we
[29:52] need we need him over here butal is a
[29:55] whole different monster lot of
[29:57] corruption
[29:58] uh like 25 different political parties
[30:02] complicated but people are never happy
[30:05] with any of the governments they ever
[30:08] pick you know and the same in Honduras
[30:11] the same in Nicaragua well ncar was a
[30:15] dictatorship and but uh yeah it's so I
[30:22] think he said the same as as he did in
[30:25] like people everywhere around Central
[30:27] America are fed up right they're Fed Up
[30:30] on their governments and they need
[30:32] something new to come in I think there's
[30:34] even been he's opened parties in a
[30:37] couple of other like in those
[30:39] surrounding countries but nothing has
[30:41] come out publicly yet I think he he's
[30:44] mentioned before a couple of times on
[30:47] Central America coming together actually
[30:50] used to be all of Central America used
[30:52] to be a single
[30:54] country and we all separated and but uh
[30:58] we're all right next to each other we're
[31:00] fairly small compared to the rest of
[31:02] other countries but together we could be
[31:04] a huge uh Powerhouse right having access
[31:07] to both oceans uh you can make a canal
[31:10] in Nar Nicaragua for example you also
[31:12] have trade with Mexico you're literally
[31:14] between North and South America in land
[31:17] is but nowadays to cross that straight
[31:20] you need to go through like three or
[31:21] four different countries for five
[31:24] different countries actually and it's it
[31:27] just makes things more expensive and and
[31:29] efficient um right it's the so I think
[31:35] you not unifying Central America would
[31:37] be really
[31:38] really really cool it's the yeah there's
[31:43] also a meme that came out like when
[31:45] Bitcoin started went got to
[31:48] 90k it's like uh it said like uh it was
[31:52] B he's like oh I'm going I'm going to
[31:54] buy Guatemala
[31:58] right yeah he he might he might does
[32:02] it I don't know if you can buy it but
[32:05] yeah so if Bitcoin gets to 3 million um
[32:09] it's the like he there's gonna he's
[32:12] going to have more cash on the the is in
[32:15] the Central
[32:16] Bank in dollars for
[32:19] example wow yeah and and probably sooner
[32:24] because he still buys Bitcoin right oh
[32:27] yeah yeah they're buying every single
[32:30] every single
[32:31] day I think the wallet is public you can
[32:34] see the Bitcoin how the Bitcoin comes in
[32:36] how it stacks and
[32:38] everything super interesting it it I
[32:42] think like
[32:43] a
[32:44] um a union around Central America United
[32:49] States of Central America I I don't know
[32:52] how to call it but that would be it
[32:54] could be really good step for Central
[32:57] America to come together and and work
[33:00] together and unify under one umbrella
[33:04] but yeah I don't
[33:05] know uh I I I have have no insights in
[33:09] the politics of of Central America so I
[33:11] don't really know if if it does make
[33:13] sense but yeah it's just a bunch of
[33:15] smaller countries that would be would
[33:18] have a bigger force on the world if they
[33:22] are
[33:23] centralizing um but yeah let's see what
[33:27] happens would be an interesting move of
[33:28] n PUK moving up one level and being like
[33:33] the the one that is unifying Central
[33:36] America oh yeah yeah it's
[33:40] the hopefully that that ends up uh
[33:44] happening
[33:46] um you know
[33:48] um and I
[33:51] think
[33:53] besides besides Bitcoin like b b is the
[33:57] one that's made like B happen I think he
[33:59] can make a lot not only in no but in the
[34:04] in the in the region there's even been
[34:06] times where like a road in Guatemala has
[34:09] been had has had like potholes and stuff
[34:11] like that near near Salvador's border
[34:15] but the gaman authorities won't go up
[34:18] and fix it so B sent like people from
[34:21] here to go to cross to guala and fix the
[34:24] road on their side you know uh so
[34:28] starting to do little little things like
[34:29] that helping Costa Rica recently too is
[34:33] the Costa Rica has been having
[34:36] uh increased violence for example and
[34:40] they also had torrential Reigns couple
[34:43] think like four weeks ago so B has been
[34:46] helping been sending Aid like uh for
[34:49] generals and everything to meet with the
[34:50] generals over there and also helping out
[34:52] with food and rations
[34:55] for it's the for the those affected by
[34:59] the Reigns so he's starting to do these
[35:01] little kind of things all
[35:03] around the region um yeah really really
[35:07] cool it's also something that I recently
[35:09] thought about is like if you go to
[35:11] Germany or any other country or most
[35:14] other countries uh and you asked oh H
[35:17] how do you think about your Chancellor
[35:20] how do you think about your president
[35:21] how do you think about the leader in in
[35:23] the country how however he's named um
[35:26] and the mostly would say like oh like
[35:29] he's not that good uh we don't like him
[35:32] uh he should be out of office and that
[35:35] probably would be the the more positive
[35:36] ones the more negative ones would be uh
[35:39] even harder than that and if you go to
[35:41] El Salvador and I did that it was in El
[35:44] Salvador asked all the Uber drivers the
[35:46] the the waitress uh and the waiters in
[35:49] in the restaurants and asked them hey
[35:51] how do you like NB how do you like
[35:53] Bitcoin and they all love NB like I I
[35:56] didn't met anyone that didn't we
[35:59] extremely
[36:00] posive uh uh towards NE peso um it's
[36:05] it's just a sense of he is actually
[36:08] popular uh and he's actually doing
[36:11] something positive for Salvador and the
[36:13] population is noticing exactly that
[36:17] that's what what I have
[36:20] seen and it's important that you
[36:22] mentioned that because uh always says
[36:26] like come and seed with own eyes right
[36:28] you come and see it with your own eyes
[36:31] that's I mean you see it you know
[36:33] there's no not much going around
[36:36] it and uh on the on the Bitcoin
[36:41] part even though for example not much of
[36:44] the say 70% of the unbanked people not
[36:48] use it for
[36:49] example or have exposure to it but it's
[36:52] a socialized topic now every single
[36:55] person in Al Sal knows about bitco knows
[36:57] what it is can go to other neighboring
[37:00] countries none of them will
[37:03] know well many of them may not know what
[37:06] it is or ever have heard of it it's but
[37:09] now you know Salvador it's so popular so
[37:12] people might have a people know a little
[37:15] bit bits and pieces about it right maybe
[37:19] not the full
[37:20] picture it's the but um they have some
[37:24] sort of opinion about it it can be
[37:26] either good or bad but it seem to had
[37:28] head it's very highly socialized topic
[37:32] now is the and I think the only thing
[37:36] that's missing is for example more more
[37:39] education on the subject and
[37:42] um people will slowly start learning and
[37:45] learning
[37:46] more very true 100% agree with that um
[37:52] another topic with you because you have
[37:56] been in America
[37:58] and in Salvador um how do you look at
[38:00] American politics right now how do you
[38:02] look at what they trying to do with the
[38:04] probably trying to do with the Strategic
[38:06] Reserve Bill uh and is this kind of the
[38:10] the the the as salador was the the small
[38:14] nation tipping the toe in and moving
[38:17] into Bitcoin and now all of the sudden
[38:19] the big whale America is coming out do
[38:21] how do you look at what they are trying
[38:23] to
[38:24] do I was talking about this with a
[38:27] friend a couple of days ago and for
[38:30] example it's good
[38:32] for good for for Bitcoin that the US has
[38:37] it it's going to become more that means
[38:38] it's going to become more relevant I
[38:40] think a lot about Game Theory right so
[38:43] we the first one to have a strategic
[38:46] Reserve you already have a certain
[38:48] benefit over the rest of the other ones
[38:51] I think that's going to start triggering
[38:53] more countries to to more nation states
[38:55] to buy
[38:56] Bitcoin however on the the US side of
[38:58] things um the US is the largest nation
[39:01] state holder of Bitcoin uh and it's been
[39:04] like that for the last five years five
[39:07] six years but uh the Bitcoin it's
[39:11] actually confiscated I mean it's not
[39:13] really their Bitcoin right you could
[39:15] there's different ways you could look at
[39:17] it um They confiscated it it's Bitcoin
[39:20] they have from confiscation so is it
[39:23] really their Bitcoin no so that's that's
[39:26] one of things and also um for example of
[39:31] the US that has access to the money just
[39:34] starts buying up all all the Bitcoin
[39:36] there is in the
[39:37] market
[39:39] um would I mean they they have most to
[39:43] the the Bitcoin right other nations
[39:46] wouldn't have access to it like you know
[39:50] so I mean I think it's good that they
[39:54] have some Bitcoin but imagine they just
[39:56] start buying all the other right I think
[39:59] it's going to be something to to watch
[40:02] out for interesting yeah we be we will
[40:06] be I think it will be fun to see where
[40:10] uh America is also moving with with the
[40:12] Bitcoin uh are you actually um you
[40:16] yourself uh living already on on a
[40:18] Bitcoin standard or how how far in on a
[40:21] Bitcoin standard are you already living
[40:23] uh no not I don't I'm not living on a
[40:25] Bitcoin standard um
[40:28] is the I would say I mean I stock BTC
[40:31] every day and uh that's about it but
[40:35] also
[40:37] uh for example I think bit Bitcoin
[40:41] standard also could include for example
[40:44] there certain trends for example eating
[40:46] eating healthy uh if I didn't hadn't got
[40:49] into Bitcoin I hadn't got I wouldn't
[40:51] have gone into the rabbit hole eating
[40:53] healthier foods stage groing all that
[40:56] stuff right
[40:57] and and also
[41:00] philosophically I probably would be is
[41:04] the uh in in like in in like a worst
[41:08] place on what money is and uh be more
[41:13] gritty uh I don't know working at a bank
[41:16] something like that and but so I think
[41:19] like the Bitcoin standard like using it
[41:21] every day for
[41:23] everything I'm not there yet I do buy
[41:25] Bitcoin and the at least that's for now
[41:29] steps I take interesting yeah um but but
[41:33] you can but you could spend Bitcoin
[41:37] already in in a lot of places so like uh
[41:40] you could be more on a Bitcoin standard
[41:43] or you're already spending it as much as
[41:45] possible so I don't spend it I I just
[41:48] hold it and but um for
[41:53] example there's not many like here no
[41:56] Sal if you go the need um you you might
[42:00] not be 100% sure like the rest of might
[42:03] might not accept the Bitcoin for example
[42:06] but there's still a lot of adoption to
[42:08] be to be done on that on that front and
[42:13] yeah the Bitcoin I just hold it keep
[42:16] some money in my bank to pay cards for
[42:20] example
[42:21] uh it's a it's still a a little bit of a
[42:25] while till we hit to uh where we can pay
[42:29] everything with with Bitcoin uh I guess
[42:32] yeah I think it's going to be be a while
[42:34] but I think that's why lightning network
[42:37] is so important the experience of paying
[42:40] with via lightning is above and beyond
[42:42] any other experience paying with any
[42:44] other method like paying with a
[42:47] bank I've never enjoyed like having to
[42:50] send like a bank transfer to someone
[42:52] it's very always chaotic takes time and
[42:57] then they ask you to send them a a
[43:00] little screenshot of the receipt and to
[43:03] their WhatsApp it's you know but when
[43:06] you pay with lightning it's high very
[43:08] seamless seamless you scan pay payment
[43:12] gets to them immediately and also it's
[43:15] final settlement payment right uh
[43:18] whereas for example if you pay with a
[43:19] card the merchant gets charged what
[43:23] three between 3 to 5% the money takes 3
[43:26] days to get to to their bank
[43:28] account you know um
[43:31] so it's the most of the payment uh
[43:35] payment and infrastructure nowadays runs
[43:37] and operates in credit so for example um
[43:42] there's some cards some POS providers
[43:44] nowadays that tell you when you process
[43:46] the card you have it in your bank okay
[43:48] but you're going to be paying four to
[43:50] 5% that 4 to 5% includes like a a loan
[43:55] that's being a credit that's being taken
[43:57] out for the dollar to be deposited their
[44:00] account meanwhile Visa takes 3 to 5 days
[44:04] to send the funds from Europe to the
[44:07] local Salvadoran bank then they net the
[44:10] credit so there's a lot of
[44:12] inefficiencies in in the Trad
[44:14] traditional system and this the when
[44:18] more tools and wallets and fch start
[44:20] adopting lightning start offering
[44:22] cheaper fees then I think we'll see more
[44:26] more adop
[44:27] true uh will be will be really
[44:30] interesting to see yeah perfect then I
[44:32] have one question that I asked all of my
[44:36] guests what can we learn from you
[44:39] besides Bitcoin besides Bitcoin I would
[44:43] say that
[44:44] uh that o has a lot of has a lot of
[44:50] opportunity um since we started
[44:52] operating in Salvador it's the and the I
[44:57] I've learned just too many things that I
[45:00] wouldn't have learned H before and um
[45:04] like for the company at least we
[45:06] developed a product that we exported to
[45:08] other to First World countries there
[45:10] were wasn't any bit lightning POS good
[45:13] lightning P we exported that uh abroad
[45:16] right and uh for for me on the personal
[45:20] side is the um I would say that uh that
[45:25] things are are possible
[45:27] if you put enough effort into them it
[45:30] hasn't been very easy working at a
[45:33] Bitcoin company in a solv because uh
[45:36] we're kind of way ahead of the banking
[45:39] infrastructure so um some it sometimes
[45:43] it's hard to explain that to people but
[45:45] uh it's the I would
[45:48] say the the same quote I said earlier
[45:51] like it's very easy to overestimate what
[45:54] can happen in 3 years and underestimate
[45:56] what can happen it's been three years
[45:57] since I started working in this and
[46:01] besides working in Bitcoin which I enjoy
[46:03] I feel very veryy you know so that also
[46:07] really cool H it would be interesting to
[46:09] see where we are long term in like 10 15
[46:12] years that will be a great place in
[46:14] Bitcoin it will be a great place in El
[46:17] Salvador I guess also um I I'm already
[46:20] looking forward to come back uh next
[46:22] year to El Salvador and see the the
[46:23] progress what's happening in the in the
[46:25] county perfect and yeah thank you so
[46:27] much uh Kanan we have entertain in the
[46:30] podcast where the previous guest is
[46:31] asking a question for the next guest
[46:33] without knowing who the next guest
[46:35] actually is and your question from the
[46:37] previous guest is what's your opinion on
[46:40] bitcoin insurances Bitcoin insurance is
[46:43] that's like um okay um so actually like
[46:49] Bitcoin and insurance or Bitcoin
[46:51] insurances for Bitcoin uh Bitcoin
[46:54] insurances so insurances uh for for your
[46:56] Bitcoin against uh a $5 rer tank
[47:01] against uh uh they being stolen or they
[47:06] being lost or something like that okay
[47:08] so for example um the thing about
[47:11] insurance is that in order for them to
[47:13] calculate or take on absorb the risk uh
[47:17] they need to know information they need
[47:19] to be able to have information on how
[47:22] how you're cting it and everything like
[47:24] that so for example you could be able to
[47:27] you could get a an insurance on your
[47:29] Bitcoin but You' have to give them a lot
[47:33] of information on that right and they
[47:36] would be very like the if it's a big
[47:39] amount the reinsurer would probably be
[47:41] looking
[47:42] at a may even ask you like where do you
[47:46] live what are what are your private keys
[47:48] right stuff like that um because they
[47:51] need to be able to
[47:54] is have take uh put a risk score on it
[47:59] stuff like that um so I think it's
[48:02] doable but it depends on how much
[48:04] information you're will to give away if
[48:06] you have a ton of Bitcoin uh you might
[48:09] not want to give that information away
[48:12] but then you also have the risk of it
[48:14] getting uh stolen right um but I think
[48:19] there's a lot of space for Bitcoin and
[48:20] insurance to to grow um maybe not only
[48:24] in insuring your Bitcoin but using
[48:27] Capital that's
[48:30] on that's on bitcoin as insurance
[48:33] capacity so there's that's so for
[48:35] example that's often time what people
[48:39] with a lot of cash do they put it uh as
[48:42] capacity for an insurance product and
[48:44] get yield on it so nowadays there's
[48:46] starting to be a lot of a lot of uh
[48:49] value in Bitcoin on an Assa that's
[48:52] highly transportable is the highly
[48:55] liquid and extremely secure right you
[48:58] can have self- costen of it it doesn't
[49:01] have to be sitting in a bank account
[49:03] with all the money getting loaned out so
[49:06] um I think uh using Bitcoin or or crypto
[49:10] in general to back Insurance product
[49:12] products can be something interesting in
[49:14] the future will will be will be uh fun
[49:18] to see but uh I because um the the
[49:21] previous guest obviously uh he has uh
[49:24] developed the first ever Bitcoin
[49:26] insurance so it was an interesting uh
[49:29] topic to to think about that and there
[49:31] are I think now two companies doing that
[49:35] uh and it's a very new topic because
[49:37] insurance companies didn't wanted to
[49:39] touch Bitcoin for a very long time and
[49:41] this just changed this year basically uh
[49:43] so it's an interesting and very new
[49:45] topic um but yeah
[49:48] obviously uh have your Bitcoin so secure
[49:52] that you don't need an insurance I would
[49:53] say yeah that that's the best case
[49:57] perfect and thank you so much uh Juan
