[00:00] if Satoshi were to ever make himself
[00:02] known with the evidence and move those
[00:04] coins and make his face known suddenly
[00:06] all the detractors of Bitcoin have a
[00:08] face that they can attack and suddenly
[00:10] becomes not about Bitcoin it becomes
[00:12] about Satoshi Nakamoto the founder and
[00:14] Creator they'll attack character they'll
[00:16] attack his um personal interests of you
[00:18] know wealth and riches and everything
[00:20] like that and that in itself can break
[00:22] the network that's why I say it's both
[00:24] the greatest strength of Bitcoin but
[00:27] also its greatest weakness if he she or
[00:29] they were to make them themselves known
[00:31] Bitcoin is solving for human behavior
[00:33] but not just that human sin they
[00:34] realized that there was a great
[00:36] framework to understand all the
[00:38] behaviors that Bitcoin was solving for
[00:39] it was the seven deadly sins so the
[00:41] seven deadly sins being Pride greed
[00:43] gluttony wrath Envy sloth I came down to
[00:46] three core principles that make Bitcoin
[00:48] successful so the first principle I
[00:50] think is minimizing adverse human
[00:52] behavior that is the behavior that would
[00:53] work in opposition to the intent of the
[00:56] system the second and third are
[00:58] Simplicity and meritocracy
[01:00] [Music]
[01:04] you remind me of uh I have no clue how
[01:07] to pronounce him chamah Cham chamat
[01:12] papaa this really rich billionaire on
[01:15] the all-in
[01:16] podcast I listen to Allin every single
[01:19] week and I think because he's I'm pretty
[01:22] sure Sri Lankan background so I've got a
[01:24] Sri Lankan background as well and I
[01:26] think there are similar features so I
[01:27] think the nose is one yeah and then we
[01:30] all have very similar kind of features
[01:32] cuz um there's a few other even Indian
[01:36] politicians that I resemble that I
[01:38] sometimes get oh hey you look like uh
[01:41] abishek batan or oh you look like I
[01:44] haven't got chamat yet so I'll I'll take
[01:46] that as a win maybe I could be a
[01:47] billionaire one
[01:49] day yeah I also think you a little bit
[01:53] sound like
[01:55] him I got like instantly when I spoke
[01:58] with you like a minute I was like he he
[02:01] is like
[02:04] that I should be a chath impersonator
[02:07] and see whether I can get into the
[02:08] all-in summit for free as a chath
[02:11] impersonator but I guess yourself you
[02:14] you all you you you usually don't see
[02:16] that that good because I get always the
[02:20] comment that I sound like Arnold
[02:21] schwarzeneger but I think people just
[02:23] say it because I'm Austrian and I speak
[02:26] English and maybe I have a similar tone
[02:29] of voice than him but I don't hear it
[02:32] like when I listen to myself I'm like
[02:34] it's it's it's not even close to that uh
[02:37] but probably like when Americans they
[02:40] usually don't listen to austrians a lot
[02:42] and the one austrians they always listen
[02:44] to is Arnold schatzer because they all
[02:47] all the themes and I'm like a little bit
[02:50] uh close to him so people are like oh
[02:52] you look you're like an Schatz I will
[02:55] say you do sound like him as an
[02:57] Australian who barely talks to any
[03:00] austrians cuz I I don't think I've met
[03:02] an Austrian native Austrian speaker here
[03:05] in
[03:07] Australia so it's very rare where I'm
[03:10] yeah I even got it from a German guy so
[03:13] like even from someone in Germany Who's
[03:15] Next Door even he said it to me that I'm
[03:18] I'm I'm sounding like but I just don't
[03:21] hear it but yeah maybe maybe I should uh
[03:24] yeah but yeah let's let's get into uh
[03:27] the the topics and it's already really
[03:28] interesting with you
[03:30] um hi Al what are you doing in the
[03:33] Bitcoin scene and and what are you all
[03:35] all about sure um what am I doing the
[03:37] Bitcoin scene so there's the standard
[03:39] I'm hodling uh I think everything else
[03:42] but Bitcoin is shitcoins it took me a
[03:43] while to get to that position but in my
[03:48] going down the rabbit hole of what
[03:50] Bitcoin is why it's valuable why I
[03:52] should care about it I asked questions
[03:55] that got me to very similar scenarios
[03:57] that we all get to the whole know hard
[04:00] versus soft money Austrian vers
[04:02] Keynesian economics um but for whatever
[04:05] reason something in the back of my mind
[04:06] always said that there's something else
[04:09] like it wasn't the whole picture of the
[04:10] puzzle so a bit of background I do a lot
[04:14] of corporate planning for large
[04:15] organizations here in Australia and the
[04:17] one thing that I always say Executives
[04:19] is this exercise called the why how
[04:21] lading where if you've got a problem
[04:23] you're trying to solve or strategy
[04:25] you're trying to build you keep asking
[04:27] yourself why until you you can't ask
[04:30] that question anymore because you've
[04:31] reached the the highest order principle
[04:35] or value or problem and at that point
[04:37] you ask well how how can we solve it so
[04:41] I did the same thing when I was going
[04:42] down the Bitcoin path and I ended up at
[04:45] a conclusion which I haven't really
[04:46] heard of in the space I actually don't
[04:49] believe that Bitcoin is ultimately
[04:50] solving for money I think Bitcoin is
[04:52] solving for human
[04:54] behavior and that came from constantly
[04:57] asking why features in Bitcoin was so
[05:00] successful why the monetary system was
[05:02] broken and I always came back to human
[05:04] behavior and when I got to that
[05:06] realization that's what forming part of
[05:08] my um research and the research that I
[05:11] do and I'll come back to that um but it
[05:14] led to more profound questions for me um
[05:18] about what happens after Bitcoin because
[05:21] if you think about if Bitcoin isn't
[05:23] solving for money and it's solving for
[05:25] human behavior once we fix the money
[05:28] what's going to happen to those human
[05:30] behaviors uh that are no longer in
[05:33] money and then my mind started realizing
[05:35] all of these Bad actors in the Fiat
[05:37] system that are taking advantage of this
[05:39] system are going to move into any other
[05:42] industry where it's easy for their
[05:44] effectively bad behaviors to
[05:46] manifest and the dystopian element of
[05:49] that is instead of stacking Fiat which
[05:51] is what they're doing right now they're
[05:53] going to start stacking SATs under a
[05:55] Bitcoin standard so I saw I'm starting
[05:58] to see this problem emerge
[06:00] assuming that we meet we get onto a
[06:02] Bitcoin standard that we're going to be
[06:03] faced with far greater problems with
[06:06] these bad actor stacking STS so it led
[06:08] to what I'm doing now in Bitcoin to
[06:10] answer the question um I've started a
[06:12] research publication called the Bitcoin
[06:14] curve and the purpose of the publication
[06:18] is to research how we scale Bitcoin
[06:20] Beyond money to tackle that very problem
[06:23] how do we tackle the Bad actors in Fiat
[06:26] leaving Fiat into things like healthcare
[06:29] education infrastructure energy
[06:32] agriculture you name the industry that
[06:34] supports our civilization after we fixed
[06:37] the money they're going to go somewhere
[06:40] and it's I think it's incumbent on me to
[06:43] start thinking about how do we solve for
[06:45] all of those other Industries but in a
[06:48] Bitcoin way so taking the core Bitcoin
[06:50] principles the Bitcoin philosophy and
[06:53] Ethos and creating a framework for us to
[06:56] solve these problems in other Industries
[06:57] so that we all cohere ly solve for the
[07:01] problems of human
[07:02] behavior so that's what I'm trying to do
[07:05] bcoin that's an amazing thing because U
[07:08] when when we say Bitcoin fixes some
[07:10] money and the money is kind of the the
[07:12] base layer of everything um what it
[07:15] actually does is fixing our incentives
[07:19] and with that is that what you mean with
[07:21] with with uh it changes human behavior
[07:24] because it's changes the incentives of
[07:26] of people I think it limits human
[07:30] natural tendency towards sinful Behavior
[07:34] by making it impossible for them to
[07:37] express it and what I mean by that is if
[07:40] you leave the gate wide open people will
[07:43] walk through it if you close the gate
[07:45] people will think twice about trying to
[07:47] get through it because it's either more
[07:49] difficult or maybe you've put up you
[07:51] know that Barby fence so it's harder
[07:53] there's a a disincentive I'd probably
[07:56] call it to try and break through the
[07:58] gate I'd say that the Fiat system as
[08:00] it's structured today has all of these
[08:02] Gates wide open so you think about soft
[08:05] money money printing it's wide open to
[08:07] take the easy way out to print money um
[08:10] the there's no proof of work in any of
[08:12] the Fiat monetary system so there's the
[08:15] ability to to gain a lot without doing
[08:18] any work and all of us are inherently
[08:20] lazy to some degree it takes a lot of
[08:22] effort to break out of that in order to
[08:24] put the effort in to get the reward
[08:27] because if you were presented with two
[08:28] options do the effort to get the reward
[08:31] or do no effort to get the reward which
[08:34] one are most people going to
[08:35] choose they're going to choose that I'm
[08:37] not going to do any effort like why
[08:39] would I expend it it makes no logical
[08:41] sense so I'd say that it's a
[08:43] disincentive or it's a closing of the
[08:45] gates um is what I'm talking about that
[08:48] Bitcoin does um and these gates are wide
[08:52] open in a whole bunch of other
[08:54] Industries and part of my problem is
[08:58] that let's just say you solve money do
[09:00] you think that the people that are
[09:01] currently exploiting these wide open
[09:03] gates are just going to say hey I've
[09:06] learned my lesson I'm never going to do
[09:07] it again I'm going to be a model Citizen
[09:10] and I'm not going to try and exploit a
[09:12] system the likelihood is no and they're
[09:15] just going to shift to somewhere else
[09:16] where the gates are wide open it's
[09:18] interesting uh to think about when when
[09:19] Bitcoin is because I truly think that
[09:23] Bitcoin brings out the good intentions
[09:25] in people uh uh and and brings out
[09:28] something being cre in in in
[09:31] personalities but I'm not sure if this
[09:34] is because we are now in an early group
[09:36] of adopters this is where I'm struggling
[09:38] a little bit with with with uh if if
[09:40] Bitcoin how Bitcoin will change society
[09:43] and I think of like the long-term VI
[09:45] because the one fact is yes when you
[09:48] look at bitcoiners who get Bitcoin
[09:50] they're all of the sudden questioning
[09:51] other things they are more critical
[09:52] thinking they're all of the sudden
[09:54] getting in shape getting to know about
[09:56] nutritions and all those those things uh
[09:58] which is to think about what what
[10:00] Bitcoin does but what I'm also thinking
[10:03] maybe that's just because we're in a
[10:05] really early group that is critical
[10:08] thinking and because when you get into
[10:10] Bitcoin because of the price you get
[10:12] exposed to a high performer critical
[10:16] thinking group that is so different than
[10:19] the rest of the
[10:20] world um that it's because we are in
[10:23] this early M uh minority uh and this is
[10:27] why we are different or could it
[10:30] actually be because of Bitcoin we
[10:33] changing our behavior and long-term
[10:35] Society completely changes for the
[10:38] better it's probably a combination of
[10:40] both and this is another part of the
[10:42] research that I do because there's three
[10:44] pillars to it I've got Bitcoins
[10:45] principles I've got public interest
[10:47] Technologies which is a very new
[10:49] emerging field and Technology adoption
[10:51] models on the technology adoption front
[10:54] I think you're bang on which is every
[10:58] technology goes through an adoption
[10:59] cycle to some degree and it's sometimes
[11:02] you see the curve where it's sort of
[11:03] like it's that S curve we see the
[11:05] technology adoption S curve or we see
[11:07] the bell curve but they both largely say
[11:10] the same thing at the very start you've
[11:12] got your your innovators these are
[11:15] highrisk tolerance dreamers that
[11:18] challenge the status quo that come up
[11:20] with the new ideas and that's the birth
[11:22] of Bitcoin and you'd call them the
[11:24] cipher punks in this case Satoshi halin
[11:28] that OG crew from all the way from the'
[11:30] 6070s and ' 80s as the cipher Punk move
[11:32] had started to grow to where we landed
[11:35] I'd say that they're those dreamers then
[11:37] you go to the early
[11:39] minority these are those who see the
[11:42] invention have a high risk tolerance
[11:44] because you have to remember when you're
[11:46] talking about Bitcoin now back in 2010 I
[11:49] was nowhere to be seen obviously but
[11:52] those people were so forward thinking so
[11:54] Visionary themselves high risk tolerance
[11:56] for what they were doing but invested
[11:58] anyway
[12:00] and I think we're now into the we're
[12:02] past that early minority stage and we're
[12:05] about to hit the early majority and so
[12:08] all of those behaviors or those
[12:11] personality types we've largely got the
[12:14] easy ones that first part is the easiest
[12:16] part of any adoption cycle because
[12:18] you're going to get those high high risk
[12:19] High reward people coming in those
[12:21] innovators now it's I think one of the
[12:23] harder portions because now you're going
[12:24] to go into the early majority where we
[12:27] start to get to that 50% adop
[12:30] where we have people that are going to
[12:31] have far lower risk tolerance we're
[12:34] going to have people that are far lower
[12:36] in their maybe Innovative thinking and
[12:40] the a all saying um nobody likes change
[12:44] everyone will push against change to
[12:45] some degree and I think we're about to
[12:47] hit those people that will consistently
[12:49] push against change whereas that didn't
[12:52] exist in the first portion of those that
[12:54] adopted
[12:56] Bitcoin it's it's also interesting when
[12:58] I think of of uh how the Bitcoin
[13:00] Community evolves I had yesterday in
[13:03] Twitter space where someone was
[13:05] criticizing that the Bitcoin Community
[13:07] lost its
[13:09] routs uh and I I disagree with that uh
[13:12] but to some extent uh it's it's true
[13:15] that uh the especially this year the
[13:18] topic change like oh Bitcoin ETFs about
[13:21] the pr there's some inflows of about
[13:23] from the Fiat system uh and and there
[13:26] are some uh bitcoiners in the in
[13:29] industry then are now just talking about
[13:31] every day about the inflows and outflows
[13:33] and what does this mean for the price
[13:34] and and and I I couldn't be less
[13:37] interested in that like I think I'm one
[13:38] of the only ones who never looked at any
[13:41] inflow chart of an ETF I I've not not
[13:44] even a clue
[13:45] what how many inflows and where I should
[13:48] look this this information up because
[13:50] I'm generally not interested in it I'm
[13:52] just interested in what does this mean
[13:54] on a broader scale for Bitcoin like the
[13:56] Bitcoin ETF brings leg legitim
[13:59] mation uh to uh Bitcoin it brings a new
[14:03] group to bitcoin all of a sudden I hear
[14:05] that a lot uh when people say like oh
[14:08] all of the sudden my father is open to
[14:09] the idea of of Bitcoin my my older Uncle
[14:12] all of the sudden is open to the idea of
[14:14] Bitcoin because of the Bitcoin ETF
[14:16] because black Ro g g black Ro gift is
[14:19] this yes you can also invest in that
[14:21] asset uh sign on it uh so it's
[14:25] interesting how how the community change
[14:27] did you notice some some commun
[14:30] changes
[14:31] in in since you here is it something
[14:34] that you like um also don't care care
[14:38] about yeah I don't no no so I do care
[14:42] only because it marked a phase where a
[14:46] new cohort of people would start to
[14:49] adopt and I always look at in the
[14:51] technology acceptance model which is
[14:54] we're going to that early majority what
[14:56] removes the barriers of that adoption
[14:59] for that class of people so that we
[15:01] maintain the adoption of this as an
[15:03] asset class because the last thing you
[15:06] want at this point is the ideology of
[15:09] Bitcoin which I think is a good one that
[15:11] says self- custody it's about individual
[15:13] sovereignty freedoms rights property
[15:15] rights
[15:16] Etc I know the ETF is at odds with that
[15:19] given that it is centralized under a
[15:21] couple of entities that technically
[15:23] custody the asset and you're just taking
[15:25] a paper version of
[15:27] it but at the same point if you don't if
[15:30] you slow the adoption down too much
[15:33] number one you extend how long it takes
[15:35] us to get this to a Bitcoin standard
[15:37] which extends pain across the world
[15:39] because if we truly believe that Fiat is
[15:41] the root of a lot of the problems that
[15:43] we're seeing in the world with the
[15:45] really bad incentives for War
[15:47] profiteering for the printing the
[15:49] ballooning of debt the the wealth
[15:51] inequality that comes from a Fiat system
[15:54] with the wealth being printed
[15:55] centralizing at the top creating greater
[15:58] disparities
[15:59] no one would want to see that continue
[16:03] for longer than it has to so at the same
[16:05] point I take it with the grain of salt
[16:07] which is yes it's not necessarily the
[16:10] best thing I think everything is good
[16:12] for Bitcoin to be honest but it may not
[16:13] be the best thing to the ideology of
[16:15] where the initial Bitcoin has came from
[16:17] but it's great for the adoption part and
[16:19] I prefer the adoption part rather than
[16:21] the original ideology purely because I
[16:24] think change is the only constant that
[16:26] we have in this world and to not have
[16:28] that that change mindset around what
[16:32] Bitcoin could be and what Bitcoin should
[16:35] be for a certain group of people and not
[16:38] have that change mindset around that
[16:39] would will stick you into
[16:42] a uh into an ideology into a thinking
[16:45] that may be detrimental to bitcoin's
[16:47] long-term success so I I'm always change
[16:50] change
[16:51] change is is there a chance that um this
[16:55] behavior model of Bitcoin is taking over
[16:59] by Bad actors who then abuse Bitcoin or
[17:04] does the Bitcoin
[17:05] model fix the incentive so that even if
[17:08] you have bad intentions you kind of
[17:11] cannot take Bitcoin over because you're
[17:12] only doing good to the network with the
[17:15] adoption uh like for example if if
[17:17] blackr would be a bad actor and they're
[17:19] now collecting Bitcoins and now they're
[17:20] doing something with paper Bitcoin uh
[17:23] they probably would shoot themselves in
[17:25] the foot because at some point it will
[17:27] come on to the top maybe it takes one
[17:29] year maybe takes 10 years I don't know
[17:30] how long but uh is is there a chance
[17:34] that bad
[17:35] actors overtake uh Bitcoin and put the
[17:39] same thing that we have in the Fiat
[17:41] system just on bitcoin with another
[17:43] asset as the same way that they kind of
[17:45] did with gold the way that I tackle that
[17:47] one
[17:49] is I'm a person that always believes
[17:51] that there's a risk there's no such
[17:53] thing as zero risk and there's no such
[17:54] thing as 100% return it's about being
[17:57] able to identify what that risk is and
[18:00] the likelihood and the consequence of
[18:02] that risk that get gives you a more
[18:04] objective framing to it so there's
[18:06] always a risk that B that black grock
[18:08] might do that could do that but I almost
[18:12] think of it back to the blocksize wars
[18:14] because at that point in time if we
[18:16] think back to there that was an
[18:17] existential battle for Bitcoin you could
[18:19] almost call it but the system that is
[18:22] Bitcoin um was built in such a way to
[18:25] allow the meritocracy of the best idea
[18:27] winning out to shine through because it
[18:30] is really a Grassroots movement that
[18:32] requires that that decentralization and
[18:35] that voting power of the nodes and the
[18:36] miners meant that no one Central
[18:39] Authority could really do anything to
[18:41] the
[18:42] network now with the black rock example
[18:45] I think the likelihood of that occurring
[18:46] is very low and there's probably two
[18:49] reasons number
[18:51] one the the supply of Bitcoin as it
[18:53] stands today we've already mined the the
[18:55] majority of the entire Supply so it's
[18:57] already in circulation so it's not like
[18:59] any n new coming through Min being owned
[19:02] by black rock is necessarily going to
[19:03] distort the system too
[19:05] much I think that the I can't I actually
[19:08] don't know how many Bitcoin they hold
[19:09] right now but I'm going to assume that
[19:11] it's less than 5% of the supply whatever
[19:14] it might actually
[19:16] be I don't know whether they'll ever get
[19:18] to a point of accumulating so much
[19:20] Bitcoin that they can exert that much e
[19:22] Force onto the system itself that the
[19:25] system itself can't self-correct now I
[19:27] think that if you think of it as a
[19:30] financial crisis or something like that
[19:32] there may be downtimes there may be
[19:34] turbulence as in they paper over it they
[19:37] destroy the system or they try to
[19:39] pervert the system it comes crumbling
[19:42] down but does that destroy the system
[19:44] and my answer to that is probably not so
[19:47] if it doesn't destroy the system then
[19:48] it's probably a temporary correction
[19:50] that might see price volatility
[19:53] confidence volatility but Tik Tock next
[19:56] block it'll continue going
[19:59] and we all have such short-term memories
[20:01] as human beings that what happened 6
[20:03] months 12 months ago is forgotten and we
[20:06] see that in Bitcoin Cycles every harving
[20:09] there's the oh my God bitcoin's going to
[20:10] go to the Moon 18 months later we
[20:13] usually hit our top we go into a bare
[20:15] Market everyone thinks bitcoin's going
[20:16] to fail and then back again to the hype
[20:18] cycle of hey next Haring block next
[20:22] haring's happening and we go through it
[20:23] again so we've done that now four times
[20:26] it's it's showing the short-term memory
[20:28] of human beings
[20:29] so I'd say that the risk is very low the
[20:32] risk is there and it means that we
[20:34] shouldn't be complacent because we might
[20:36] as well avoid the pain that we don't
[20:38] need to Face by intervening before it
[20:40] becomes a problem and part of that is
[20:43] what we're doing here having the
[20:44] conversation you know so educating
[20:47] people as to what Bitcoin is why you
[20:48] should self custody why you shouldn't be
[20:50] on the ETF because that will minimize
[20:52] the pain of anything that they may
[20:53] attempt to
[20:54] do and just to uh add here that black
[20:58] holds now not even 300,000 Bitcoin so a
[21:01] little bit over 1% of the supply uh not
[21:04] not even close to the 5 uh% I think in
[21:06] total all Bitcoin
[21:09] ETFs uh are close to 1 million uh uh
[21:14] Bitcoin uh when you calculate all the
[21:17] Bitcoin ETFs together uh something like
[21:20] that but black R itself only also around
[21:23] 300,000 um which is also an interesting
[21:27] debate because uh micro strategy micro
[21:29] strategy also has around that like they
[21:31] have a little bit over 1% also like I
[21:33] don't know 20 20, 220,000 or something
[21:36] like that uh it will be really
[21:38] interesting to to to see how this all
[21:41] shakes out in the in the long run but
[21:43] it's yeah it's still so early like the
[21:45] Bitcoin ETFs were only approved in
[21:46] January we're here sitting during June
[21:49] less than 6 months of them being running
[21:52] I would I would want to see what does
[21:54] this look like in four five 6 years time
[21:57] because you have to look at the time
[21:58] Horizon of a lot of these institutional
[22:00] investors and by the way I'm not an
[22:02] Institutional Investor I'm a I'm an IT
[22:05] consultant SL non-executive so it's from
[22:09] my learning of the topic from
[22:12] afar but just seeing how businesses make
[22:14] decisions over the long term we have
[22:16] 5-year plan 10year plans the way that we
[22:19] um manage our treasuries on in terms of
[22:23] the company that I sit on is with a
[22:25] wealth manager we don't do it ourselves
[22:27] and we look at the time Horizon of cash
[22:30] availability in a 10year period in a
[22:32] 20-year period not necessarily in a 1
[22:35] two and 3E period so the problem that we
[22:38] have here in these hype Cycles where
[22:40] we're looking where some people are
[22:42] looking at these ETF inflows daily and
[22:44] whatnot is that their time Horizon is so
[22:46] short they're looking at it in such a
[22:48] short period of time we have to zoom out
[22:50] and say okay well what does this look
[22:52] like in five years does that then seem
[22:54] to pose a problem at its current inflow
[22:56] rate if they're saying what is it that
[22:58] the stand portfolio might eventually
[22:59] have you know 2 to 3% allocation to
[23:01] bitcoin and if that's the portfolios of
[23:04] every single wealthy individual super
[23:06] anation or pension fund around the
[23:09] world what does that actually look like
[23:11] how much Bitcoin will they in aggregate
[23:12] hold at that point and then there's the
[23:15] whole point of are they all controlled
[23:16] by the individual entity because yes
[23:18] they may control um they may all own it
[23:22] the system but they're all in different
[23:24] countries they're all maybe different
[23:25] custodians at that point so will they
[23:28] really be able to coordinate themselves
[23:30] to do anything and if it's still under
[23:32] you know 10 15 20% of the total
[23:36] circulating
[23:37] Supply is that even enough to do
[23:39] anything to the
[23:41] network and I I can't I can't see it
[23:45] yeah and I think something really
[23:46] important here to not this yes Black
[23:49] Rock uh holds that Bitcoin on coinbase
[23:53] holds the Bitcoin for for for Black Rock
[23:56] and they're not black Rock's Bitcoin
[23:59] blacker is just uh managing them for
[24:02] their clients so that's something
[24:03] important to note that blacker is
[24:06] basically just a middleman because
[24:07] coinbase has the keys uh and legally
[24:10] owned by other people and black works is
[24:12] kind of in the middle uh so there's a
[24:16] lot government intervention I think it
[24:19] was the more the government intervention
[24:20] on that similar to what they did in
[24:22] seven in the in the US Where They
[24:24] confiscated gold would they do something
[24:26] similar to confiscate the Bitcoin to
[24:28] stabilize the US dollar because that's
[24:30] what Nixon did in 71 when he took them
[24:32] off the gold standard and stopped the
[24:33] Redemption of gold for US Dollars it was
[24:36] there to stabilize the system that they
[24:39] were perverting will they do the same
[24:41] thing if the US dollar goes under
[24:42] collapse I think that's the problem
[24:44] because then you've now centralized that
[24:46] into a government rather than um uh the
[24:51] coinbase cing it on behalf of all the
[24:54] other people that have bought it through
[24:55] the ETF so they've effectively ized it
[24:58] that way so I I could see that's the
[25:01] case and the other part is black Rock's
[25:03] voting power on the various boards in
[25:06] which they also hold ownership of so how
[25:09] they in how they exert their influence I
[25:12] don't think it's going to be a binary we
[25:14] can do something to bitcoin because
[25:16] we've got the ETF I think it's going to
[25:18] be very complex in that they pull a
[25:20] number of business levers that they've
[25:22] got access to whether it be political
[25:24] influence in conjunction with business
[25:26] influence in conjunction with Bitcoin
[25:29] ETF influence so I think there's
[25:31] multiple things that will that they will
[25:33] use in conjunction to get to their
[25:38] outcomes I love it a lot uh and you also
[25:42] like you have a really great articles uh
[25:45] that that you have online uh and one of
[25:47] the Articles uh was I think even the
[25:51] headline or or something in in the
[25:52] beginning was uh fear and monetary
[25:55] slavery and this was one of the first
[25:58] topics that I got interested in in in
[26:01] like the first topic that I publicly
[26:04] wrote about uh Bitcoin that was really
[26:07] going wide on on on Twitter where I made
[26:10] like a short comparison like between
[26:12] actual
[26:14] slavery uh that was happening in in the
[26:17] early days and how the feat system was
[26:20] there and that's yeah an interesting
[26:22] comparison obviously they also quite
[26:25] different it's like a soft form of of of
[26:28] of that um but for the people that never
[26:32] heard about that example or for the
[26:34] people that never read your article how
[26:36] do you compare feat with with slavery
[26:39] and and why is feat like Monet modern
[26:43] slavery yeah absolutely so for a bit of
[26:47] context as to where the opinion sort of
[26:49] stemmed from for the audience because
[26:51] this is actually my first podcast I've
[26:52] never done this uh before so no one will
[26:55] have ever seen me um I do a bit of work
[26:58] work as a non-executive director on
[27:00] company boards here in Australia and the
[27:02] nonprofit space and as a director here
[27:05] in Australia one of our director
[27:07] obligations is that we need to ensure
[27:10] that we do not have modern slavery at
[27:13] any part of our supply chain so this is
[27:16] usually targeted at is there child sex
[27:20] or child or sex trafficking is there
[27:23] forced labor that forms part of the way
[27:26] in which we procure goods and services
[27:28] we all have to make a modern slavery
[27:30] statement that says that we will that we
[27:33] do not have any modern slavy um
[27:37] practices within our supply chain to be
[27:40] ethical companies and that's a legal
[27:43] obligation on us so when you actually
[27:45] look at the definitions of modern
[27:47] slavery and I'm just going to pull up
[27:48] that article so I can actually read them
[27:50] out because you know people will look at
[27:53] this and those in the Fiat system will
[27:55] say n it's not modern slavery you've got
[27:57] the definition wrong and they'll try to
[28:00] cast doubt on the on the on the Merit of
[28:05] the statement so in my article I
[28:07] actually go through and I pull out the
[28:09] definitions from both the US Department
[28:11] of State anti-slavery dog and the
[28:14] Australian Attorney General's office as
[28:16] to what the definition of modern slavery
[28:17] is so that it's unref so modern slavery
[28:21] and I'll read the the US Department of
[28:22] State uh us they describe it as
[28:26] compelled service using a number of
[28:28] different terms including involuntary
[28:30] servitude slavery or practices similar
[28:33] to slavery debt bondage and forced labor
[28:37] so the US in that definition there that
[28:40] they have published themselves says that
[28:42] modern slavery is um can be uh can occur
[28:48] if you have debt
[28:50] bondage anti-slavery org um says
[28:53] something very similar and the
[28:54] Australian attorney general also calls
[28:56] out debt bondage now I I say debt
[28:59] bondage because that's the key mechanism
[29:02] by which modern slavery occurs in the
[29:04] Fiat monetary system so then you then
[29:06] your next question is well what's the
[29:07] definition of debt bondage so debt
[29:10] bondage and there's and there's a number
[29:12] of international law definitions again
[29:14] US Department of State definitions that
[29:16] I used in order to justify this but the
[29:19] three takeaways from the definitions are
[29:22] the first is the in debt bondage is the
[29:24] inheriting of debt second is that the
[29:28] the reasonable value of the debt not
[29:30] being used to liquidate it and the third
[29:33] is the length and nature of the debt not
[29:36] being limited or
[29:38] defined so when we think about debt
[29:40] bondage um in in the form of maybe
[29:43] you've your maxed out on your credit
[29:45] cards and maybe I'm let's just say I'm
[29:47] maxed out on my credit cards as an
[29:48] example if I die that debt stops with me
[29:52] it's not like my children inherit my
[29:54] credit card debt the estate is settled
[29:57] they can't get anymore the debt is then
[30:00] cancelled so in that case my credit card
[30:03] debt is not inherited um and therefore
[30:07] not debt bondage but in the case of the
[30:12] state when a
[30:15] government spends more than it claims in
[30:17] tax receipts so that is they're they're
[30:21] they're spending more than they get in
[30:22] they go in they issue bonds they get
[30:24] money from the Federal Reserve in our
[30:27] case it's from the reserve Bank of
[30:28] Australia and they use that borrowed
[30:30] money to make up the difference and that
[30:32] then becomes a debt to the to the
[30:35] Australian government US Government
[30:37] whichever government is printing that
[30:39] money now they will say that most debt
[30:42] comes in the in the form of 10e bonds
[30:45] 30-year bonds whatever it might be and
[30:47] that's the 10 year the time length in
[30:49] which that debt
[30:51] exists the problem that I have with this
[30:54] is intent versus
[30:58] I'll call it the the lawyer speak the
[31:01] lawyer speak would say hey it's a
[31:03] 10-year bond it's going to be paid back
[31:05] after 10 years it doesn't constitute
[31:07] debt bondage because there's a defined
[31:09] term I say that the government has no
[31:12] intent of paying back the debt all
[31:15] they've done is used more debt to pay
[31:18] back the old debt and they roll over the
[31:21] debt bond that that Bond and they roll
[31:23] over the debt because there is no intent
[31:28] for any government to pay back the debt
[31:30] and we know this because I know
[31:32] Australia just released our annual
[31:34] budget we're in Surplus for this year
[31:37] but they've locked us in for a deficit
[31:38] the next two years so I think we're in
[31:40] Surplus and I'm going to get these
[31:42] figures wrong so someone will fact check
[31:43] me I think Australia is going to be in
[31:44] Surplus 9 billion for this current this
[31:49] coming Financial year but the following
[31:51] year we're going to go 14 billion in
[31:53] deficit the year after that we're going
[31:54] to go 25 billion in deficit so the the
[31:58] government themselves are saying we're
[32:00] never paying back this debt and we're
[32:02] going to increase
[32:03] it so if you look at the intent of what
[32:06] modern slavery would say it would say
[32:08] that there is no intent to pay back the
[32:12] debt the debt will continue to roll over
[32:16] once I die and and I have benefited from
[32:18] that debt it gets inherited by my
[32:21] children and my children's children and
[32:23] my children's children's children as
[32:25] long as the system exists so therefore
[32:28] it is debt bondage and by definition
[32:31] that is modern slavery if you are
[32:33] listening to this podcast you might be
[32:35] wondering what do actually the setup
[32:37] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[32:40] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[32:42] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[32:44] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[32:46] right way let's focus on the first thing
[32:48] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[32:51] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[32:53] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[32:55] an exchange that has an own token or
[32:57] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[32:59] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[33:02] for me the best partner for that and now
[33:06] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[33:08] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[33:10] a self custody solution where you your s
[33:14] hold your keys and it should be a cold
[33:17] wallet so that's my Simple Solutions
[33:20] that's a bitbox you just put your
[33:22] Bitcoin on there back up your seat phas
[33:25] and you are better than 95% % of all
[33:28] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[33:30] ,000 in Bitcoin it's a absolutely must
[33:34] have one last thing before we get back
[33:36] to the video I'm really passionate about
[33:38] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[33:40] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[33:43] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[33:46] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[33:49] conference in whole of Europe for all
[33:51] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[33:54] this place in June for all europees it's
[33:56] a must go anyways you are so close to
[33:59] the Bitcoin PR conference you basically
[34:01] have to come I will do interviews there
[34:04] and I would love to meet you all there
[34:06] use code Robin for all my sponsors to
[34:09] get discounts and use the links down in
[34:12] the description I I love that the BR
[34:14] never heard that with the actual
[34:17] definition uh of the US Treasury and
[34:20] then how it's actually defined that
[34:23] that's that's really cool um when we
[34:25] come now to to to bitcoin
[34:28] do you imagine Bitcoin freeing us from
[34:30] that system because at some point fat
[34:34] will die I think it'll free us from the
[34:36] system so I always look back and I think
[34:39] yeah I've got that I've got the book
[34:40] there the Bitcoin
[34:41] standard I assume that we'll eventually
[34:43] get to that Bitcoin standard it's going
[34:46] to be a very bumpy ride it's going to
[34:50] harm a lot of people in the process cuz
[34:52] we're destroying a very ingrained system
[34:55] and any Empire change any system change
[34:57] will feel that sort of disruption and
[35:00] turbulence so yes it will free us but
[35:02] it'll be painful the part that I'm
[35:03] unsure of is how much that pain is
[35:06] because when you wipe out the debt
[35:08] effectively you're saying we're going to
[35:10] go through a debt Jubilee that is we're
[35:12] going to forgive or we're going to erase
[35:14] all these debts and that's happened over
[35:16] time and actually ly alden's book broken
[35:18] money goes through that quite
[35:21] well people will by definition lose
[35:25] value as a result of that debt being
[35:27] wiped out because the debt is owed to
[35:28] someone that someone has given out
[35:31] capital and expecting it to be returned
[35:34] I actually don't know what that looks
[35:35] like and hopefully a monetary theorist
[35:37] and an economist would be able to talk
[35:39] through that but in once that does occur
[35:42] I then believe it there's it does then
[35:45] free us from that cycle of debt bondage
[35:48] because under a Bitcoin standard that
[35:50] whole point of going to a Reserve Bank
[35:52] to print money out of nowhere doesn't
[35:54] exist it cannot exist because Bitcoin
[35:57] coin is a scarce decentralized digital
[36:00] asset you can't print it out of nowhere
[36:03] it will force the incentive of the
[36:05] government to only spend within its
[36:08] means and by doing so Drive competition
[36:11] within economies in order to drive the
[36:12] prices down and I can't remember
[36:15] which person said this but um it's you
[36:19] know as technology advances we should be
[36:21] getting close to the marginal cost of
[36:23] production that is the the economy
[36:26] should be deflation nature which I
[36:28] completely agree but what we see is
[36:30] inflationary I think once you go into a
[36:32] Bitcoin standard you start to see that
[36:33] deflationary nature of the economy start
[36:35] to rise start to manifest itself and
[36:39] then as a result you'll be able to
[36:41] deliver more with less because You'
[36:43] become far more efficient at it through
[36:45] technology advancements and that's what
[36:47] will drive economic growth and
[36:49] stimulation and advancement of all of
[36:51] our countries globally not the fact that
[36:53] we're just printing money taking the
[36:54] easy way out so yes Bitcoin will Sol of
[36:57] it but there'll be damage in the
[36:59] meantime and I think it's right to call
[37:02] out the damage in the meantime but I
[37:04] think that it's what is
[37:07] owed and while you and I probably
[37:10] younger will probably pay for it and our
[37:12] parents generation were the ones that
[37:13] probably benefit from it at the most
[37:15] unfortunately it has to stop with
[37:16] someone we have to break the cycle and
[37:18] unfortunately I think it's going to harm
[37:19] us the most or the Next Generation after
[37:21] us uh yeah just a quick note I think
[37:23] this was Jeff Jeff poof that said that
[37:26] uh one in in in his book uh for for
[37:29] everyone listening I have episode with
[37:31] Jeff buan if if someone is interested in
[37:34] him or if someone is in the Bitcoin
[37:36] community and does not know about Jeff
[37:38] Bo I think they should definitely check
[37:40] his workout and and great starting
[37:41] Marans the episode before um but when we
[37:45] come to this and I love Jeff Po's uh
[37:49] approach because he
[37:51] said everything is on nature level
[37:55] deflationary like should be deflationary
[37:59] by Nature because we're getting better
[38:01] in producing it and this was a big mind
[38:04] shift I had to do because I was in this
[38:07] inflationary mind and I was like yeah of
[38:08] course prices go up but and never really
[38:11] questioned that and when you really
[38:13] question that and you think like but why
[38:16] do prices go up like we get robotics
[38:19] like we get a better manufacturing
[38:21] things we we get clever in producing
[38:24] things why does the price of things have
[38:27] to rise and we see it I think best
[38:31] example is with technology like the
[38:33] iPhone iPhone prices were Rising but you
[38:37] get so much more value now than with the
[38:40] first iPhone like the the value is like
[38:42] 20x or 50x from from the first iPhone
[38:45] because it just got so much better the
[38:47] camera quality and everything so the the
[38:50] the or maybe let going uh way more back
[38:54] like a computer in the 19 1995 five or
[38:57] something like that was not even close
[39:00] to capable of what the iPhone can do now
[39:03] uh and the computer back then was more
[39:05] expensive than the iPhone now so we see
[39:07] that deflationary
[39:09] mindset that deflationary nature um but
[39:12] it's actually with everything in the
[39:14] world like the banana should be become
[39:18] cheaper with with with come with with a
[39:22] normal monetary system and I say really
[39:25] normal not sound money because it's like
[39:27] when we have just a normal monetary
[39:29] system which is not debased um that
[39:32] would be great um when we spin this
[39:35] thought long and longer in in in the
[39:38] future do you think we could come to a
[39:41] point where we live in abundance because
[39:45] we figured out the uh the fundamental
[39:49] layer of our society where oh we have
[39:52] robots that can get the bananas out of
[39:54] the the trees and and we have uh this
[39:57] and that and we really don't have to
[40:00] work to
[40:01] to get our basic needs uh in order so we
[40:05] can actually focus on I don't know
[40:07] getting us to other other spheres and
[40:10] other spaces other planets we can focus
[40:13] on making music we can focus on making
[40:16] uh research about new things and
[40:18] everyone can like really focus on your
[40:21] in on their own passion I mean this
[40:23] Utopia uh thinking but when we think of
[40:26] like prices keep decreasing we we might
[40:30] be at the point where we really live in
[40:32] abundant system is is that possible or
[40:34] is this dream wishing from my side no no
[40:37] I I don't think it's possible I think
[40:39] it's inevitable because history would
[40:41] say us tell us that it is you only have
[40:43] to zoom out far enough to realize that
[40:46] history is already telling us that we're
[40:47] heading into that direction if you
[40:49] rewind 10,000 years ago all you would
[40:52] probably be doing day in day out is
[40:54] trying to figure out where's my next
[40:56] meal coming from do I have water that I
[40:58] can drink because without those two
[40:59] things I'm probably going to die within
[41:01] 3 days and do I have a form of shelter
[41:04] so that I've I've got some level of
[41:07] protection that was 10,000 years ago now
[41:10] let's rewind and then suddenly modern
[41:11] agriculture comes in I think that was
[41:14] I'm going to get this wrong 6,000 years
[41:16] ago whatever it might be and we were
[41:18] still now producing a bit more
[41:21] abundantly we didn't have to think about
[41:22] food as much but it was still hard labor
[41:25] because we hadn't perfected agriculture
[41:27] techniques then you rewind to you know a
[41:30] thousand years ago and suddenly your
[41:33] agriculture started to flourish we
[41:35] started to get our Wheats and our Breads
[41:37] and all of this started coming through
[41:39] rewind it even aund and something years
[41:42] ago to the start of the 19th century uh
[41:45] 19 no 20th century sorry no no did I get
[41:48] that right no the 20th century 1900 to
[41:52] 2000 I'm going to get that one wrong as
[41:53] well but again technology had Advanced
[41:56] to the point where we now we had yes
[41:59] blue color jobs we also started to see
[42:00] the emergence of white color jobs that
[42:02] were thought leaders scientists thinkers
[42:05] who didn't have to worry about getting
[42:06] food they were worried about solving the
[42:09] mysteries of the universe medicines Etc
[42:13] and now look at us right now I don't
[42:15] think either you or I are going to have
[42:16] to worry about food per se as in we
[42:19] will'll survive there'll be food
[42:20] somewhere we don't have to go out hard
[42:22] thinking about it we can create a
[42:23] podcast like this from the comfort of
[42:25] our own homes make a living we've
[42:28] already gotten to the point where
[42:30] technology has brought a level of
[42:32] abundance to us and for what we can see
[42:34] coming down the line more abundance is
[42:37] is yet to come to the point of Robotics
[42:39] Automation and AI you know before we
[42:42] started recording AI improved my writing
[42:45] um efficiency by close to 2 to 3x so
[42:48] that's that's enabled me to have more
[42:51] time to do other things which means that
[42:54] to the point of abundance I'm already
[42:56] experiencing that with a technology that
[42:58] was only really introduced in the last 2
[43:00] or 3 years let alone what's about to
[43:02] come the next 20 30 or 40 years so
[43:05] history would say absolutely we are
[43:07] heading towards even more abundance um
[43:10] and we're heading towards that at an
[43:12] accelerated rate and I purposely said
[43:14] 10,000 then 6,000 then 1,000 and then
[43:17] now suddenly we're talking in 10year
[43:19] increments yet the advances in
[43:23] technology are greater than what greater
[43:25] in 10 years now than probably what
[43:27] happened in a thousand years you know a
[43:31] couple of um a millennia ago
[43:35] so history is the greatest teacher and I
[43:39] think one of our shortcomings is we
[43:40] don't take we don't zoom out anywhere
[43:43] near far enough to be able to put the
[43:46] time period that we're living in proper
[43:48] context we only look at it from our
[43:51] parents generation our grandparents
[43:52] generation but we should be zooming up
[43:54] far further than that and from that we
[43:57] get better insights into the trends that
[44:00] we're actually on it's it's fascinating
[44:02] to think about that and uh like the the
[44:05] the thought that came into my mind uh
[44:08] which is a weird one but I still say it
[44:11] um when when we talk about that abandon
[44:13] future and the the the society coming
[44:15] closer to it it's really good that we
[44:18] have Bitcoin now like uh it's it's like
[44:20] what what what do we do when we we don't
[44:23] have have Bitcoin and there's this uh I
[44:26] think it was a podcast like a two-hour
[44:28] podcast uh it's it's it's just
[44:31] speculation um obviously uh but there's
[44:34] this this thought like oh
[44:36] maybe Bitcoin was brought to us by some
[44:40] higher species that observed uh uh our
[44:45] Earth and was like there's there's
[44:47] something missing there they they they
[44:49] need some they need some technology
[44:51] there uh because it's pretty miraculous
[44:54] that we don't know who Nakamoto is like
[44:58] that I never I don't know if this ever
[45:00] happened in in in history where there's
[45:02] such a huge Revolution going on and we
[45:05] really don't
[45:07] know much about what where the person is
[45:10] came from and like how this is came to
[45:13] be and and what his motivations were and
[45:15] stuff like that I mean we know some
[45:17] things from him but not a lot of things
[45:19] uh that that that's a that's a that's
[45:22] just a thought that I just had I want to
[45:23] to throw it out but and you know the um
[45:27] the Satoshi thing's an interesting one I
[45:29] I don't know about aliens giving us
[45:31] technology called Bitcoin to do
[45:33] it but the Satoshi piece I think is
[45:38] going to be seen as the most important
[45:40] ele his anonymity is going to be known
[45:43] as the most critical piece for why
[45:46] Bitcoin will work and I I'll give I'll
[45:50] give you my reason why but I also think
[45:52] and I'll do a disclaimer I think that
[45:54] anonymity is also the biggest threat to
[45:57] Bitcoin now they come hand in hand I
[46:00] think I think of it as a double-edged
[46:01] sword so my thesis on bitcoin is that it
[46:05] sols for human behavior not for money
[46:08] and the framework in which I look at
[46:10] that human behavior is through look I I
[46:13] had my own back like my own my own
[46:15] upbringing as a in religion I was a
[46:18] Hindu being when I was raised and so I
[46:20] learned about religious values religious
[46:22] wisdoms and my father once told me that
[46:25] um religion is a way of life it's not
[46:27] that you'd necessarily pray to a god
[46:28] it's a set of principles and values in
[46:31] which that guide you to live a life
[46:33] worthy of the of the love of God was is
[46:36] effectively um the case it was that sort
[46:39] of upbringing alongside asking that why
[46:41] question that I was talking to at the
[46:42] start which got me to that point of
[46:44] saying it's solving for human behavior
[46:46] but not just that human sin and using
[46:49] that sort of religious context I
[46:51] realized that there was a great
[46:52] framework to understand all the
[46:55] behaviors that Bitcoin was solving for
[46:57] it it's the seven deadly sins so the
[46:59] seven deadly sins being Pride greed
[47:01] gluttony wrath Envy sloth and I think
[47:05] I've forgotten
[47:06] one
[47:08] but Pride if you look at all those seven
[47:11] deadly sins is sometimes seen as the
[47:13] root of all sin or it's the sin in which
[47:15] all others stem from Pride being ego and
[47:19] self-interest I think Bitcoin solves
[47:22] money through minimizing all that human
[47:24] sin and we can sort of go through what
[47:26] that actually looks like um in a bit
[47:28] more detail but the core one which is
[47:30] pride and this is why I think Satoshi
[47:32] nakamoto's anonymity is by far the most
[47:36] valuable element of Bitcoin is that he
[47:39] tackled Pride at the most fundamental
[47:43] level the first part is in terms of
[47:47] self-interest the satoshi's wallet is
[47:50] the most valuable wallet on the Bitcoin
[47:54] blockchain right now would probably put
[47:56] him in the top what five richest people
[47:59] on the planet if it is an individual
[48:01] maybe a group we just don't know and yet
[48:03] not a single one of those coins has
[48:06] moved he has forgone or she or they have
[48:09] forgone forgone all self-interest for
[48:13] the betterment of the network so that's
[48:15] point one point two on
[48:17] ego we saw this with Craig Wright he
[48:20] really wanted to be Satoshi Nakamura but
[48:22] that was proven to be complete
[48:25]  but
[48:27] Satoshi has given up his ego by not
[48:31] being known as the creator of the
[48:32] greatest monetary technology humankind
[48:34] has ever seen so in the act of anonymity
[48:38] he's provided us with the greatest act
[48:41] of um humility through forgoing ego and
[48:45] forgoing
[48:46] self-interest but there in also lies the
[48:49] greatest risk to bitcoin because right
[48:52] now Bitcoin is greater than any one
[48:53] person because there is no creator of it
[48:56] it belongs to all of us and so there's
[48:59] no one individual that can be attacked
[49:02] there's no one face that those that
[49:04] detract against Bitcoin can point to and
[49:06] say hey that guy's really evil or that
[49:09] guy's full of it or that guy's greedy
[49:11] and that's and he's all he's going to do
[49:12] is rug pull us all because that that guy
[49:15] does not exist there is no face to
[49:18] bitcoin if Satoshi were to ever make
[49:21] himself known with the evidence and move
[49:24] those coins and make his face known
[49:27] suddenly all the detractors of Bitcoin
[49:29] have a face that they can attack and
[49:32] suddenly becomes not about Bitcoin it
[49:34] becomes about Satoshi Nakamoto the
[49:35] founder and Creator they'll attack
[49:37] character they'll attack his um personal
[49:40] interests of you know wealth and riches
[49:43] and everything like that and that in
[49:45] itself can break the network because the
[49:48] network is just the confidence of all
[49:51] the miners and all the nodes that by
[49:53] acting by the rules of the system um we
[49:56] will all benefit from it it's a it's a
[50:00] system with the right incentives in
[50:01] place you put some you put doubt into
[50:04] any of these people's minds by putting
[50:06] the real face of the Bitcoin Creator on
[50:09] show and we see the human flaws that are
[50:12] naturally inherit in all of us come to
[50:14] the for uh go come to the Forefront
[50:17] that's something that can be physically
[50:19] attacked so that's why I say it's both
[50:23] the greatest strength of of Bitcoin but
[50:28] also its greatest weakness if he would
[50:30] if he she or they were ever to make
[50:32] themselves
[50:34] known I I love it so much and then I
[50:37] still can't believe that it's it's your
[50:38] first podcast because you you you now
[50:43] one of my favorite uh interview guests
[50:45] it's it's it's fascinating how great you
[50:48] you're speaking like you're you're
[50:49] definitely on a on on Chef Bo level of
[50:52] of like thinking and and and and uh
[50:54] explanation at least from from my
[50:56] perspective if everyone has has his own
[50:58] favorites but it's it's amazing I really
[51:01] appreciate that thank you how you you go
[51:03] through that um because yeah like it's
[51:06] completely off topic but maybe I just
[51:09] quickly say like I have a podcast where
[51:11] I interview everyone like next week I
[51:13] will interview in person Michael sailor
[51:16] uh the last few congratulations on that
[51:18] by the way I saw your announcement on
[51:19] that one there I said mate you totally
[51:22] completely deserve it you've put in the
[51:23] work proof of work and proof of reward
[51:25] is there so I can't wait to hear that
[51:27] one yeah that's that will be a crazy one
[51:30] like I till now I never did a in-person
[51:34] podcast and uh on this day I will have
[51:38] three inperson podcasts and one with
[51:41] Michael sailor one with the CEO of
[51:43] treasure uh because we are interviewing
[51:46] Michael saor in in the in the office of
[51:49] of um in the office of Satoshi Labs
[51:53] paring company of treasure uh and in the
[51:57] morning I probably have with Luke brl so
[51:59] like this is my first ever uh iners
[52:02] podcast it would be interesting to see I
[52:03] have I have no clue how how good I am in
[52:05] person but uh it's it's the same skill I
[52:08] hope so uh and I can say is an easy easy
[52:11] job but the the the point that I I
[52:13] wanted to I wanted to make is I forgot
[52:16] the point that I wanted to make yeah the
[52:18] point that I wanted to make is I have a
[52:19] lot of uh newbies on like I have a lot
[52:22] of that are just starting out or have
[52:25] like maybe done one podcast before never
[52:28] done a podcast before and some even
[52:30] never done anything really in in the
[52:32] Bitcoin space I just had some
[52:34] interesting conversations with them on
[52:35] Twitter I was like yeah let's let's jump
[52:37] on a call and let's do a podcast that's
[52:39] I think the the the the interesting part
[52:44] about my podcast you can turn in and
[52:46] there's like someone you never saw
[52:48] before uh and and all of the he's
[52:50] interesting because and you've never
[52:53] heard him speak before and then there's
[52:55] also the big one and and it's always a
[52:57] surprise to me like how how good are
[53:00] those because when you never done
[53:02] something you you need a little bit
[53:04] training how how you get a point across
[53:06] and I'm just uh surprised positively
[53:09] surprised how good you are in this I was
[53:13] and I'll say a part of that comes from
[53:14] part of my career so the other element
[53:16] I'm not just a director on boards I
[53:19] spent well I I'm currently in it but
[53:22] I've been in sales and Consulting in it
[53:23] for 10 years so I broke out of it when I
[53:26] started out out of uni and I'm I'm now
[53:28] really digressing I'm a physics major
[53:31] out of uni cuz I wanted to be an
[53:32] astrophysicist realized that I sucked at
[53:35] math I could I was good enough to pass
[53:37] uni but I was never good enough to be
[53:39] great like and math is the language of
[53:42] physics so if you're not great at the
[53:44] language that describes your discipline
[53:47] it's very hard to be creative in it and
[53:49] I and I love to be creative so I pivoted
[53:51] into business but it forced me into it
[53:54] sales and Consulting and the first few
[53:56] years in in sales the feedback I'd
[53:59] always get is hey you're too technical
[54:01] hey you're going into the numbers I
[54:02] can't follow you it makes no sense and
[54:05] so it forced me to build my skill set of
[54:08] communicating complex ideas to sometimes
[54:10] audiences that had no idea about tech
[54:13] but I think it's just practice because
[54:15] it took me about 10 years or so to get
[54:18] to the point now where I think I can
[54:19] convey a complex idea in a narrative
[54:23] that sort of makes it easy for people to
[54:25] understand uh so yeah that's probably
[54:27] where where it comes from sales and
[54:29] Consulting so something good comes out
[54:31] of
[54:32] Consultants amazing yeah speaking if you
[54:35] want to speak good you have to speak a
[54:37] lot uh this also what I noticed with the
[54:40] podcast a little bit when I listen to my
[54:42] first podcast and I'm like oh I
[54:45] could have done a better job and and now
[54:47] it's a little bit better still think I
[54:49] could do a better job but every day
[54:50] doing it I just noticed that my speaking
[54:52] skills are getting so much better uh
[54:55] with doing it just every day and you
[54:57] consistently have one hour and you
[54:59] always have a different guest so there
[55:00] are the guests that I had one guest on
[55:02] and I often speak actually about this
[55:05] one episode where I asked him one
[55:07] question in the beginning and then he
[55:08] spoke for 55 minutes
[55:12] so that that that was really not hard to
[55:16] interview because he just like spoke on
[55:18] him own and there guests that just give
[55:21] like two sentence answers so that's like
[55:25] then I'm surprised he just did not give
[55:27] a lot but yeah it's it's it's it's
[55:29] interesting how you evolve but yeah
[55:31] let's let's let's come uh before we
[55:34] because we are close to the one hour
[55:36] mark before we come close to the the end
[55:38] routine I have um two more Bitcoin
[55:41] questions that I'm I'm I'm curious about
[55:43] what you what you what you think of them
[55:46] um and you also wrote about that and
[55:49] articles about that um what do you think
[55:51] is the core principle for Bitcoin like
[55:56] what the core principles of Bitcoin that
[55:58] that you value the most inside of the
[56:00] ecosystem so when whenever you do
[56:02] research like what I'm trying to do with
[56:03] the Bitcoin curve you need to be able to
[56:07] be complex yet simple at the same time
[56:10] you need to be able to have the richness
[56:11] of the complexity of to what makes
[56:14] something tick but you need to
[56:16] understand it so well that you can bring
[56:18] Simplicity to it and that's one of
[56:19] Einstein's uh more famous
[56:21] quotes So for me in in my exploration of
[56:25] it
[56:26] I came down to three core principles
[56:28] that make Bitcoin successful the first
[56:31] one we've sort of touched on a little
[56:32] bit which is about this human sin
[56:35] framework that I use in order to get to
[56:37] describe how Bitcoin solving for money
[56:39] so the first principle I think is
[56:41] minimizing adverse human behavior that
[56:44] is the behavior that would work in
[56:46] opposition to the intent of the system
[56:49] the second and third are Simplicity and
[56:54] meritocracy and that's it minimize
[56:57] adverse human behavior Simplicity
[57:00] meritocracy and the powerful thing about
[57:03] looking at Bitcoin through that lens is
[57:05] that if this was not a Bitcoin podcast
[57:08] and I just said hey the the recipe for
[57:10] success is minimize human behavior
[57:13] Simplicity meritocracy there is no way
[57:16] that you'd be able to say that hey
[57:18] that's actually Bitcoin or that's
[57:19] solving for money you could say that's
[57:21] solving for healthcare that's solving
[57:23] for Education it's they're almost
[57:25] Universal principle
[57:27] and because it's Universal it's
[57:28] fundamental I wouldn't say Universal
[57:30] fundamental sorry these are so
[57:32] fundamental that they go beyond money so
[57:35] and therefore can be far more meaningful
[57:38] than just saying hey we've got hard
[57:40] money
[57:41] again so and and it's quite evident and
[57:44] I and I'm not just saying that hey
[57:46] that's what I think there's evidence
[57:47] behind it Simplicity is the first one
[57:49] and I'll quickly touch on both
[57:51] Simplicity and meritocracy because I
[57:52] think they're powerful Simplicity is the
[57:55] Bitcoin White paper was nine pages it's
[57:58] actually eight pages if you get rid of
[58:00] the reference page so eight pages to
[58:02] describe what is the solve for the
[58:05] entire monetary system globally was
[58:07] written in eight
[58:09] pages now well I I'll I'll do a bit of
[58:12] um comparison to to our favorite
[58:15] shitcoin ethereum when ethereum the
[58:18] white paper was launched it was 30
[58:19] something pages long so significantly
[58:22] more verbose and complex when you look
[58:25] at the code base of Bitcoin when it was
[58:27] first launched it was only 14,000 lines
[58:29] of code and I think right now it's
[58:30] approaching 880,000 lines of code as you
[58:33] know we've developed it um as the as
[58:36] we've um adopted it ethereum was
[58:39] launched with 660,000 lines of code and
[58:43] I haven't even looked at to say how much
[58:44] it is now so even where ethereum started
[58:47] we are still 10% of the code base yet I
[58:51] would say that we've got a more robust
[58:52] solution than ethereum will ever have
[58:55] and that is the almost the essence of
[58:58] simplicity so that's part one and
[59:02] meritocracy this one is going to be
[59:05] overlooked at times but is the only
[59:08] thing that will keep this system afloat
[59:10] Merit talks to the best ideas winning
[59:13] out and when we've seen the bitcoin's
[59:16] history we've seen that play out time
[59:19] and time again they look like
[59:20] existential threats but all they are is
[59:23] just testing the robustness of our
[59:25] system and our system system is based on
[59:27] meritocracy so when the Block siiz Wars
[59:29] came up it was a Grassroots movement
[59:30] from the bottom up came with the idea
[59:32] hey we should have bigger blocksizes hey
[59:34] keep it the same the debate ensued and
[59:38] the voice of the people that were part
[59:40] of the system that were um users of the
[59:43] system came forward and actually said no
[59:45] we're not going to increase the block
[59:46] size happy days but the idea had some
[59:50] Merit to increase the block size and
[59:51] there was rigorous debates there were
[59:52] ideological warfar there were you know
[59:55] I'm I'm assuming lots of friendships
[59:56] broken in the space of the time but the
[59:58] best idea won out and Bitcoin is now
[60:00] stronger as a result of
[60:02] it that is meritocracy at work there is
[60:06] no intervention there is no single
[60:08] individual that says it's my way or the
[60:10] highway it is the best ideas went out
[60:13] and it's still the case with
[60:15] bips and it's still going to be the case
[60:17] if we ever reach a hard Fork we're going
[60:19] to get into another meritocratic process
[60:21] so you can almost say that this form of
[60:23] meritocracy is the ultimate form of
[60:24] democracy in many ways because it should
[60:27] be the best ideas that win out not just
[60:29] the people in power win out so that's
[60:32] why meritocracy and simplicity as
[60:34] fundamental principles and values of
[60:36] Bitcoin um are going to be important and
[60:38] just quickly on
[60:40] Simplicity you cannot have a
[60:42] meritocratic system unless everybody in
[60:45] the system can understand what's going
[60:48] on so if you don't bring Simplicity to
[60:51] the system to allow that access to
[60:55] understanding of the system to everyone
[60:56] so it could be me as an IT professional
[60:59] but what if the restaurant worker down
[61:01] the road is also a bitcoiner but wants
[61:03] to understand what the future direction
[61:05] of the platform is going to be or the
[61:06] system sorry is going to be or you know
[61:09] a construction worker or a nurse it has
[61:12] to be simple enough for everyone to
[61:15] understand because then we can all
[61:17] participate and if we all participate
[61:19] the system will be stronger as a whole
[61:21] so if you lose simplicity at any point
[61:23] during this process you're going to lose
[61:25] people which means you're going to lose
[61:27] um participation and if it's not
[61:30] meritocratic people aren't going to feel
[61:32] like they had their say that it's not
[61:33] the best idea and if the best ideas
[61:35] don't win out it will ultimately fail so
[61:38] those are the three minimize adverse
[61:40] human behaviors Simplicity
[61:43] meritocracy I love it so much um this is
[61:47] this is really great because it it
[61:48] explains what Bitcoin is and on a really
[61:51] fundamental layer uh with principles
[61:54] that
[61:56] are found in every
[61:59] like there's this principles uh I think
[62:02] El m talked about that uh when he says
[62:05] about developing code he's not measuring
[62:08] uh a software developer on how much
[62:10] lines of code he can add but more than
[62:13] how how many lines of codes he can
[62:15] delete and still get a efficient process
[62:18] and this is always the the case in so
[62:20] many other areas not not only in in in
[62:23] technology you the the simplier you can
[62:26] get it the better it is that's what I
[62:28] also try to do with the podcast I try to
[62:30] like make the process of having an guest
[62:35] on from I have no contact with the guest
[62:38] to I have a full episode with him out as
[62:41] simple as possible because I wanted to
[62:43] do it daily which yeah I only have so
[62:46] many hours in in a day so I cannot uh
[62:49] spend too many hours on on that and too
[62:51] many on that and and and I have to make
[62:54] a really simple process which still
[62:56] allows me to get a great podcast out
[63:00] Simplicity is always a really
[63:02] interesting and and great Point yeah I
[63:05] love I love how you think about that
[63:08] that stuff before we get to the actual
[63:11] end routine I have a new end routine
[63:14] that kind of came up in the last few few
[63:17] episodes um what are you currently
[63:19] passion about uh and and which which we
[63:21] did not cover in the podcast like was
[63:24] which is not in in in in in Bitcoin I
[63:27] asked that question for one specific
[63:29] reason um I found out that because we in
[63:31] the early group of bitcoiners bitcoiners
[63:34] are really interesting people that do a
[63:36] lot of different stuff and I think uh as
[63:38] a Bitcoin Community we can learn from
[63:41] each other uh outside of how money
[63:45] works yeah cool um well I'd say the
[63:48] thing that I'm that because I've only
[63:50] just started the passionate thing is my
[63:52] research publication but what I will say
[63:54] the other one is
[63:56] I you raised at the very start of this
[63:59] I'm not too sure it was part of the
[64:00] recording but Bitcoin has seemed to also
[64:03] be really into the healthcare piece so I
[64:05] went hard into the carnivore diet and
[64:07] then now modified it now and got into
[64:09] the best shape of my life so there's an
[64:10] element of the gym which I love the SAA
[64:14] which I love the new diet that I'm on as
[64:17] well and so I'm going down that rabbit
[64:19] hole on health genetics
[64:22] longevity that part's awesome and the
[64:24] other part is so I renovated my entire
[64:27] house myself alongside my wife so we
[64:29] bought this place during the pandemic so
[64:32] Side Story so I'm based out of Melbourne
[64:34] Australia we were the most lockdown city
[64:36] in the world because I think we spent
[64:38] 260 something days under effectively
[64:42] house arrest but by the way that's also
[64:44] one of the reasons why I'm an avid
[64:45] bitcoiner because I was stripped of so
[64:47] many of my rights but during that period
[64:49] of time was the best time because we
[64:51] just bought this house needed renovation
[64:53] so I got onto YouTube
[64:56] I found a number of DIY videos from this
[64:59] guy out of Canada and then he taught me
[65:02] how to do it so I did all my Plastering
[65:03] flooring did the entire kitchen myself
[65:07] I've done um I've just built some
[65:10] laundry doors just over that side there
[65:14] all these little projects and um redone
[65:17] the entire backyard so we've almost
[65:18] trying to get as self-sufficient as
[65:19] possible with fruit trees and everything
[65:21] like that so I've gone not quite tin
[65:23] foil hat but as self sufficient as
[65:26] humanly possible but the cool thing
[65:28] about it is when you actually start to
[65:30] just think you know what I can I can
[65:31] give it a go I can just do it is it's
[65:33] far easier than what you actually think
[65:35] it is cuz I thought you know Plastering
[65:38] that seems like that seems like pretty
[65:40] hard work or installing a kitchen that
[65:42] seems like I could screw it up in actual
[65:44] fact it actually isn't that hard like
[65:47] after you after you look at a couple of
[65:49] videos and you attempt at yourself
[65:52] putting in a kitchen is actually not
[65:54] that hard you just need to take your
[65:55] time time and so push I think that was
[65:58] me pushing myself to try and do
[66:01] something new with YouTube you can learn
[66:04] pretty much anything that you really
[66:06] want to learn and just give it a go
[66:08] because for me it turned out awesome and
[66:10] my wife loves me even more now because I
[66:12] saved us I
[66:13] think 80 grand in in trady fees uh and
[66:19] and uh so that was a extra plus from
[66:23] that little hobby of mine
[66:26] it's fascinating to hear about the the
[66:28] co era because on the one side I really
[66:31] hated that we had those extreme
[66:33] lockdowns and I mean you were in a
[66:35] extreme place with a really hard
[66:37] lockdowns I can remember that uh I went
[66:41] to play beach volleyball uh in um I
[66:45] think June 2020 in Austria because then
[66:49] they were like opening up a little again
[66:51] after the lock down and I don't know was
[66:53] what was February March like it was not
[66:55] that long and then I could actually go
[66:57] out with friends again uh and it was not
[67:01] even that hard execute that like this
[67:04] this rules were stricter than the
[67:07] Austrian uh police was was govering and
[67:10] but when I look at what Australia did
[67:12] this was like long way way different
[67:17] than that but the the positive point
[67:19] that I always get is like
[67:22] people most people not everyone but most
[67:25] people were completely stopped in what
[67:27] they were doing till now including me uh
[67:31] and all of the sudden they had time to
[67:33] research they have time to think they
[67:36] were forced to be in the house they
[67:39] could not meet friends they were forced
[67:40] to be for themselves and this is
[67:45] something quite valuable actually when
[67:47] you're all of a sudden forced to think
[67:50] uh and what do you do with your time and
[67:52] most people were researching doing some
[67:54] creative stuff and this was this is the
[67:58] the biggest benefits from I always I'm
[68:01] really optimistic person so I'm always
[68:02] trying to figure out what what's the
[68:04] good of that that's like my my head is
[68:06] always like when something bad happens
[68:08] like what is the what is the best thing
[68:10] I can get out of this bad thing happened
[68:12] is always like how my mind works and
[68:14] this is what what I'm going to in this
[68:16] area because it's actually quite nice
[68:19] thing that that happened there uh and
[68:22] this is why a lot of bitcoiners say oh
[68:24] yeah 2020 I discovered and research
[68:27] about Bitcoin or were like oh I started
[68:29] this in 2022 in the co area I I heard
[68:32] that sentence so many times uh and and
[68:36] this is the the one thing uh that is
[68:38] really positive about that area uh and
[68:41] and yeah I love that uh that you also
[68:43] had that experience I think it's like a
[68:45] sink or swim kind of moment there are
[68:47] those that will look into that adversity
[68:50] and find opportunity and those that will
[68:53] opt to wallow in their
[68:56] adversity and for a lot of us we saw the
[68:58] opportunity because our eyes were opened
[69:01] or we tried to take the more positive
[69:03] lens on making something good out of a
[69:06] bad situation so I it it separated for
[69:09] me a lot of people because I still see
[69:11] quite a quite a few people that are
[69:13] adversely impacted by it because they um
[69:16] retreated into themselves through that
[69:18] period and as a result you know they
[69:20] they're far worse off but for those to
[69:23] your point and I know a lot of
[69:24] bitcoiners who found Bitcoin similar to
[69:27] me in that 2020
[69:29] era um we got possibly the greatest
[69:33] opportunity of our lifetimes because we
[69:36] got to start stacking effectively uh at
[69:39] at that bottom end of that 1819 20,000
[69:42] piece and got to see the runup so it was
[69:44] um there's always opportunity and
[69:46] adversity it's just you just need to
[69:47] open your eyes to it and go in with that
[69:49] mindset and that
[69:51] worldview yeah I blow again never
[69:56] uh buy as many Bitcoin than I bought in
[69:58] 2020 under 10,000 it was it was an
[70:01] amazing time you can never buy enough at
[70:03] any point in time you can never buy
[70:05] enough definitely
[70:07] yeah um coming to the endro team the
[70:09] actual endro te that I had since the
[70:11] beginning since the first episode of the
[70:13] podcast and we're now at 145 actually
[70:16] already um we have end had a previous
[70:19] guest is asking a question uh for the
[70:22] next guest without knowing who actually
[70:23] is the next guest uh so this question is
[70:26] the one question that is not coming from
[70:28] me it's coming from the previous guest
[70:30] and it's the one question that sometimes
[70:32] brings up the completely new topic
[70:34] sometimes it's a new interesting thing
[70:37] uh to the to the topic that we already
[70:39] had and it's an interesting this was a
[70:41] question that because 145 questions some
[70:45] of them are double in there already but
[70:47] this is a completely new and unique one
[70:50] oh nice uh who who was the hardest
[70:53] person you ever orange p
[70:55] and how did you finally convince him in
[70:57] the end o that's a tough one I'm going
[70:59] to say the hardest one only because it
[71:01] took the most amount of effort was my
[71:03] wife and I'll I'll say and I'll give you
[71:06] a bit of context to the to the answer
[71:09] those that have orange pilled have been
[71:10] ready to be orange pilled and I think
[71:12] that this is a consistent theme when I
[71:14] talk to people if you push Bitcoin too
[71:17] hard down people's throats they're not
[71:19] going to be receptive to it you almost
[71:21] need to be known as the Bitcoin guy so
[71:24] that people know who to come to when
[71:26] they're curious and so a lot of the
[71:28] people that have orange pilled are
[71:29] people that have known that I'm the
[71:30] Bitcoin guy that have then come to me
[71:32] rather than me forcing it down their
[71:34] throat so it's really hard to say who
[71:37] the toughest person is but in my wife's
[71:40] case she had no choice but I knew that
[71:44] she trusted me so I was stacking STS and
[71:46] she just said okay I trust
[71:48] you I got it to the point of needing to
[71:53] understand why I was doing it so so that
[71:55] she believed as hard as I did because
[71:58] when you're married you're on a life
[71:59] journey together and it's not enough
[72:01] that she trusts you to do it I think for
[72:04] me it had to be she needed to understand
[72:06] deeply enough that she was also on that
[72:09] same path of thinking as me and I knew
[72:11] because we were married we came with the
[72:12] same values and principles and so the
[72:15] reason why it was the hardest was she's
[72:16] very different to me I'm a physics major
[72:20] mathematician I'm analytical as as you
[72:22] can come she's a graphic designer
[72:25] advertising agency um account director
[72:29] she's more on the creative front and so
[72:31] you had I had to
[72:33] describe what Bitcoin enabled us to be
[72:37] able to do uh in the life that we both
[72:40] wanted which got me thinking very
[72:43] differently about why Bitcoin is so
[72:45] important why Fiat in contrast was
[72:49] actually our worst enemy not our great
[72:52] Ally and even now why property cuz we
[72:55] property Rich why buying more property
[72:58] was actually the wrong thing and buying
[73:00] more Bitcoin was the right thing and
[73:03] getting her to the point of comfort in
[73:04] volatility so I think that's probably
[73:06] the hardest one because it stretches
[73:08] your thinking the
[73:11] furthest I I love the answer a lot and
[73:13] it's my my girlfriend did not get it
[73:15] till now uh fully but she she will come
[73:19] there uh and and I'm also approaching it
[73:22] from a slow perspective uh because she's
[73:26] exposed to more and more bitcoiners
[73:27] she's exposed to more and more Bitcoin
[73:29] content uh and and she she will get it
[73:32] in the end and and she's asking more
[73:35] questions about it and I'm confident as
[73:37] you also said because she has similar
[73:39] values uh there's a reason why we are
[73:42] together uh and why we chose to to be on
[73:45] this live journey together uh in the end
[73:48] she will come to the same conclusion or
[73:49] like a similar conclusion than than I
[73:51] came with Bitcoin uh and and this all
[73:55] takes time and this time is is okay to
[73:59] be taken um perfect and thank you all
[74:02] for for for being on the show Before I
[74:04] Let You Go um where can people find you
[74:07] where can people ask you
[74:09] questions yeah cool uh I am on X now
[74:12] like until I started this publication I
[74:14] really wasn't but I'm on X at arves
[74:16] notes that's a RVs n o t s but if you
[74:19] want to read the work that I do you can
[74:22] go to my substack which is the Bitcoin
[74:24] curve . substack
[74:28] docomo Vis Audi visual versions of the
[74:32] Articles because I know that they're
[74:33] long form and people just sometimes
[74:34] don't want to read it and I'll I'll
[74:36] create a YouTube but if you go to the
[74:37] substack you go to my my um Twitter X
[74:41] profile you'll be able to get in contact
[74:42] with me uh on both of those platforms
[74:44] amazing yeah and and uh I would even
[74:47] encourage you to uh because I see that
[74:50] you have really great uh um uh articles
[74:54] and really great content and and unique
[74:57] uh styles of delivering it uh I think it
[75:00] would be great to to I mean it's a lot
[75:02] of work but it's would be great to have
[75:03] a book from from you if you uh did not
[75:06] have to to plan that that's a big
[75:08] Endeavor I was going to say that was
[75:10] that's it's probably going to be closer
[75:11] to Lynn's journey I think Lynn's a great
[75:14] example as to what I'm trying to emulate
[75:16] in that created content slowly built up
[75:18] the library built up the knowledge base
[75:21] and then when the book idea came about
[75:24] she was able to execute what was an
[75:26] incredible book and something that I
[75:28] still you can sort of tell from all the
[75:30] little tabs on top of it I reference a
[75:32] lot in my work now and so I I have a lot
[75:35] of respect for how she went about it so
[75:37] I'd say the book is probably on the
[75:38] horizon but not till I've got enough
[75:41] value that's acknowledged I think by the
[75:43] audience in the articles that I do and
[75:45] maybe one day that'll be on the
[75:47] cards amazing yeah I'm already looking
[75:50] forward to do the the podcast interview
[75:52] with when you launch the pod Absolutely
[75:55] I'll hold you off I'll hold you to that
[75:57] offer perfect then yeah thank you for
[75:59] being on off uh and for everyone
[76:01] listening as always I'll be back
[76:04] tomorrow with another episode bye-bye
[76:06] awesome thanks a lot bye
