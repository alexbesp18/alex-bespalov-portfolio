[00:00] if a person adopts Bitcoin they're going
[00:02] to get wealthier than the people around
[00:03] them if a business adopts Bitcoin their
[00:06] stock is going to take off if a
[00:07] politician gets on bitcoin they're going
[00:09] to start winning people are going to
[00:11] start looking at that they're going to
[00:12] be at their shareholder meetings they're
[00:14] going to sit at the board they're going
[00:15] to say what are we doing these guys are
[00:18] suddenly growing their balance sheet 40
[00:20] 50 60 100% a year apple and birky haway
[00:24] sitting on hundreds of billions of
[00:25] dollars if you then look at a 7% true
[00:28] inflation in your purchasing power power
[00:30] and you hold 300 billion of cash that's
[00:32] what $21 billion in purchasing power
[00:35] you're losing every year the real game
[00:37] we're all playing right now is how big
[00:39] of a share of the 21 million coins Can
[00:42] you capture now for yourself most people
[00:44] are going to be using Bitcoin in the
[00:46] future without knowing anything about it
[00:48] when a nation state starts adopting
[00:50] Bitcoin that's probably going to be the
[00:51] ultimate F while micro strategy has to
[00:54] do clever Financial Engineering in order
[00:57] to buy Bitcoin the government could just
[00:59] press a button and they could push it to
[01:01] a million dollars in a day if they
[01:02] wanted
[01:03] [Music]
[01:07] to I have one of my most favorite topics
[01:10] and this is Bitcoin and businesses and
[01:12] the B business adoption of of Bitcoin um
[01:16] let's just directly jump into the why
[01:18] like why do you think Bitcoin is
[01:20] especially vital for businesses and then
[01:23] later we can go a little bit where we
[01:24] are currently at at the adoption phase
[01:27] 100% this is one of my favorite topics
[01:30] as well it's an endless Rabbit Hole uh
[01:34] and it's just a very very important
[01:36] topic because I don't think Bitcoin for
[01:39] business is just a an option or a a a
[01:43] nice thing to do I think it's an
[01:44] imperative for a lot of
[01:46] businesses just the same way that
[01:49] Bitcoin is imperative for for us as
[01:53] individuals to survive in this Fiat
[01:56] inflationary world it's the same for a
[01:58] business they have all the same stru Les
[02:00] and I like what uh Michael sailor always
[02:03] says Bitcoin is the solution for every
[02:05] person every organization every family
[02:07] every country it's it's really the same
[02:09] story but obviously for businesses it's
[02:12] a bit unique um but I'd love to delve
[02:15] into that little bit deeper I don't know
[02:16] if there's something specific you kind
[02:17] of want to get at or just the the
[02:19] business case for Bitcoin in general I
[02:21] guess yeah absolutely I think uh
[02:24] business
[02:25] have as an individual especially if
[02:28] you're a young individual you have the
[02:30] advantage of not having to care too much
[02:34] about risks because you're only uh
[02:36] responsible for yourself and I think
[02:38] that's the biggest difference to
[02:40] businesses where when you are let's say
[02:43] um a mediumsized business with let's say
[02:46] 500 employees I mean that's a good size
[02:49] company already but let's say 500
[02:52] employees um you basically not only take
[02:55] the decision to put uh Bitcoin on your
[02:58] balance sheet for yourself s yeah you
[03:01] kind of indirectly also take the
[03:03] decision for all your employees that
[03:05] rely on you paying their salary and
[03:08] stuff like that so I think that I think
[03:09] that's the biggest difference do you
[03:12] also see it that way that's actually
[03:14] very very good point I mean the the
[03:16] value proposition is the same regardless
[03:19] of what kind of entity you're talking
[03:21] about but the the level of let's call it
[03:25] perceived risk or actual risk you're
[03:27] taking in a corporation by putting big
[03:29] on your balance sheet is definitely
[03:31] orders of magnitude higher um it is I I
[03:37] I think the way the way I I kind of
[03:39] think about it is as a corporate
[03:41] Treasurer or a business owner or a CEO a
[03:45] CFO you have a responsibility a
[03:48] fiduciary duty to do the best that you
[03:51] can for your company in managing the
[03:53] money making money whatever and while
[03:57] Bitcoin certainly is new and it's it's
[04:00] risky there's there's risks to
[04:01] everything I think you have a
[04:03] responsibility to look into it and and
[04:06] seriously think about adopting it
[04:10] because if if you sit on the sidelines
[04:13] and wait it's you're just going to get
[04:16] out competed by the companies that do
[04:18] you're going to continually uh get eaten
[04:21] Away by inflation and so it it's all
[04:23] about your education because once you
[04:25] truly understand it and you managed to
[04:28] educate the other state stakeholders in
[04:30] your company your employees and
[04:31] everybody's on board we've seen this in
[04:34] the companies that do adopt it it's like
[04:36] a fire like a shining light that that
[04:39] like lifts the whole company up and
[04:41] breathes new light life into it yeah it
[04:44] seems kind of like a no prer like all
[04:46] the companies that have adopted it have
[04:49] amazing experiences with that I never
[04:50] heard any company with a bad example of
[04:54] like they made extremely like the all
[04:56] the employees wanted to quit and like
[04:59] nightmare like that like I I don't I
[05:01] never heard of any of that so are you
[05:04] kind of satisfied with the adoption rate
[05:07] and growth of of the corporate uh
[05:10] adoption of of Bitcoin I'll say you
[05:13] always kind of want things to happen
[05:14] faster than they do and it it's funny
[05:17] back in the spring when we had the the
[05:19] having I thought I was late to the game
[05:21] you know um starting Sovereign and and
[05:24] and providing education for businesses I
[05:26] thought okay this is about to completely
[05:29] go out of hand and I'm kind of late to
[05:31] the game well 9 months later now or
[05:34] whatever it is we're still just like
[05:37] getting lift off from the ground on this
[05:40] I think it's such a niche thing
[05:43] it's I think if you asked a thousand
[05:45] business owners on the street if they're
[05:47] thinking about putting Bitcoin in the
[05:48] balance sheet I don't think you'd get a
[05:49] single one of them saying that so it is
[05:52] very very new very early thing yeah it's
[05:55] it kind of makes me because it's um I do
[05:58] think it's also uh we are extremely
[06:00] early to the game but it kind of makes
[06:03] me wonder when are we not early like
[06:07] when is the point when we no no no
[06:09] longer early it's hard to say what what
[06:12] has to happen then probably reach a
[06:15] saturation point with like 80 90% of the
[06:17] adoption but that's that's far down the
[06:19] line yeah I I I think my dream scenario
[06:23] is that we kind of break the the
[06:26] fouryear cycle I don't know if it's
[06:28] going to happen but that's what I would
[06:29] like to see because in the previous uh
[06:32] history of Bitcoin the last 16 years
[06:35] it's been a lot of retail people a lot
[06:37] of investors just seeking investment
[06:39] gains and being very emotional about
[06:42] Bitcoin and obviously the volatility all
[06:45] that that's a feature not a bug but the
[06:48] the way it can crash 70 80% it's much
[06:52] easier when a bunch of crypto Traders
[06:55] can liquidate their their leverage
[06:57] position on a Saturday night but
[07:00] once 100,000 companies hold millions of
[07:03] dollars in Bitcoin and nation states
[07:05] hold it I hope it's going to create some
[07:08] sort of buffer where we don't see these
[07:10] kind of draw Downs because it would be
[07:13] pretty catastrophic at that point if if
[07:16] a lot of an economy has invested in
[07:18] Bitcoin and it had that downturn but the
[07:20] downturn is due to a lack of
[07:23] understanding in my opinion so it's it's
[07:25] very interesting I don't know the answer
[07:27] to it actually interesting yeah
[07:30] um let's come back to the uh adoption
[07:33] curve of of the corporate adoption I
[07:35] feel like 2020 might be the beginning
[07:38] year obviously before that companies
[07:42] already had Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[07:45] but with 2020 the first publicly traded
[07:48] company in America with micr strategy
[07:51] adopted Bitcoin um I I feel like that's
[07:54] the official starting point for the
[07:58] corporation uh option phase uh where are
[08:01] we right now and and how how do you look
[08:04] back at the last four years of of
[08:06] corporate adoption great question I
[08:09] think the the companies that went in
[08:11] back in 2020 if you look at them it's
[08:14] really outliers and companies that
[08:17] already really got Bitcoin like well
[08:20] micro strategy was actually coming in
[08:22] from the sidelines but you had block you
[08:24] had Tesla these kind of companies but is
[08:26] a very very Niche thing to do um I
[08:30] actually subscribe to again Sailors uh
[08:33] uh thinking that 2024 is kind of the
[08:36] starting point for bitcoin's corporate
[08:38] adoption um I think you can make the
[08:41] argument both ways but that's where it
[08:43] really started getting taken serious in
[08:46] the mainstream kind of narrative that's
[08:49] when Fidelity and Black Rock and Van
[08:52] came out with all their investment
[08:53] thesis around
[08:55] Bitcoin uh the spot ETFs and and now
[08:58] Bitcoin is just taken
[09:00] a I'm curious like for you how it's been
[09:04] like the last year two three especially
[09:06] coming through the bull market the way
[09:08] Bitcoin has changed and the way the
[09:10] narrative has changed it's very very
[09:12] interesting to me and I hope it's just
[09:14] going to keep going like that and we get
[09:16] this
[09:16] legitimate information spread instead of
[09:19] all this uh dumb fud or whatever you
[09:21] want to say I think it a lot has changed
[09:25] actually last year um yeah I don't know
[09:27] if it's because of the price if it's
[09:29] because the ETFs with black rock are
[09:32] here now or more more like even Trump is
[09:36] now in the game so it it feels
[09:39] like it feels like it's it gets harder
[09:41] and harder to get
[09:44] funding for Bitcoin against Bitcoin
[09:48] campaigns uh to get the word out against
[09:51] Bitcoin just because the side of for
[09:56] Bitcoin the the the pro Bitcoins side is
[10:00] getting stronger and stronger and
[10:02] therefore the data the proof what
[10:05] Bitcoin actually does uh gets better and
[10:08] better uh and it just gets harder and
[10:11] harder to to have that F going on which
[10:15] is a really good sign we still have a
[10:17] lot of mainstream me I don't know where
[10:20] you at home but in Austria uh we have
[10:23] mainstream media when when Bitcoin comes
[10:26] into the media it's either because it
[10:28] shoots up crazy or it crashes down crazy
[10:32] that that's the only times when they are
[10:35] they are reporting on
[10:37] it I mean I'll definitely say the
[10:40] average mainstream opinion on bitcoin is
[10:42] very uninformed and I just I just feel
[10:45] like there's not this kind of venom in
[10:48] people's words there's not this kind of
[10:51] hatred towards it that there was just a
[10:53] couple years ago every time it was
[10:55] mentioned it's so bad it's all these
[10:57] criminals and it's bad for the en
[10:59] environment and it's horrible now when I
[11:01] see people on CNBC especially in the US
[11:04] um I don't I'm from Denmark but I don't
[11:06] really follow the media here um I think
[11:08] it's very positive and I think some of
[11:11] the the news anchors are actually
[11:13] supporting Bitcoin and we've seen these
[11:15] funny clips where somebody will come on
[11:17] sit there talking saying all sorts of
[11:19] nonsense about Bitcoin and then actually
[11:21] being corrected Bitcoin is actually not
[11:24] only is it not bad for the environment
[11:26] it's actually our most
[11:29] um a most powerful lever against climate
[11:33] change it is actually really good for
[11:36] the environment it actually is the best
[11:39] performing asset the volatility is a
[11:41] feature not a B I mean you could go on
[11:45] and on and on but this is changing now
[11:47] and I'm actually seeing this being said
[11:49] by by more mainstream sources and
[11:51] that it's not just a bunch of uh
[11:54] bitcoiners yelling on Twitter now it's
[11:56] actually the the the big fish that are
[11:59] starting to get on the narrative and I
[12:00] think that has a tremendous impact on on
[12:03] the narrative in general it's interest a
[12:06] lot of uh OG bitcoiners and a lot of
[12:10] Hardcore Bitcoin Maxes even think that
[12:13] that might be a bad thing that uh those
[12:16] uh big institutions and the big
[12:17] corporations are now kind of entering
[12:20] the the game and uh yeah as you said the
[12:23] changing the narrative do you see it as
[12:26] a
[12:27] potential uh bad thing for for Bitcoin
[12:29] that the narrative is changing or maybe
[12:32] one step before that how do you see the
[12:35] narrative changing uh right now such a
[12:39] good question um I think some people
[12:43] might be a little bit over sellers in
[12:48] their their their desire to keep Bitcoin
[12:52] kind of Cipher Punk or keep it
[12:54] underground or keep it um for the
[12:57] individual and I I respect that a lot I
[13:00] honestly have a lot of respect for
[13:02] people that really want to keep the
[13:03] integrity and the values of Bitcoin
[13:05] intact but I think we have to
[13:07] acknowledge that we don't want Bitcoin
[13:10] to be A2 trillion doll asset forever and
[13:14] just be a thing that we kind of use for
[13:17] this and that and whatever it's like a
[13:18] nich thing we want the world to become
[13:22] hyperbitcoinization and in well I'm not
[13:25] I'm only speaking for myself but I would
[13:27] love to see a world where big Bitcoin is
[13:29] everywhere and not just on Twitter in
[13:33] order to get there we must get people on
[13:35] board we cannot say Oh Black Rock cannot
[13:39] be in this the government can't buy it
[13:41] it is a huge risk it is the risk of
[13:45] capture by these people that we know
[13:49] would not I would not put it behind them
[13:51] to to try to take over Bitcoin in some
[13:53] way but it's a risk we have to take if
[13:57] we want it to go mainstream if it want
[13:59] it to go to its natural end I think in
[14:01] my opinion we need the support of the
[14:04] establishment what else can we do I mean
[14:07] there's no other option in my
[14:09] opinion absolutely yeah it's just like
[14:12] if if you want Bitcoin to grow of course
[14:14] companies will buy it of course Nation
[14:16] sets will buy it of course your enemies
[14:19] will buy Bitcoin and it's
[14:22] it's that The Narrative of Bitcoin is
[14:25] for everyone might be hard uh to to
[14:29] swallow for some some people yeah well I
[14:33] understand it because it's it's it there
[14:37] is a risk of growing too fast that's
[14:40] what I would say would be the risk if it
[14:42] if it went too fast and there suddenly
[14:45] was a gigantic amount of Bitcoin just
[14:48] custody one place for example with
[14:50] coinbase and suddenly the US government
[14:52] and everybody's in
[14:54] it um Beginnings are delicate times and
[14:58] Bitcoin is still in its infancy I mean
[15:00] if there's $900 trillion of assets and
[15:02] we're at a little bit over 2 trillion or
[15:04] something last I checked there is a risk
[15:07] of it just happening too fast and we're
[15:09] not ready for it but I'm I'm happy to
[15:12] see this I would rather have
[15:15] everybody Black Rock getting in now
[15:17] pumping it up and and we can disperse
[15:19] this knowledge to the world and sitting
[15:21] around for another 5 10 years just
[15:23] talking on bitcoin Twitter about you
[15:25] know this and that so I we need
[15:29] I think I think Bitcoin is an asset
[15:31] either it grows or it dies off like yes
[15:35] it has to kind of uh become bigger and
[15:40] bigger uh and come to a a substantial
[15:44] size in our because it's a network
[15:46] Effect game it's similar to uh social
[15:50] media if if you're not one of if you're
[15:53] not coming to a substantial size of
[15:56] users at some point people
[15:59] will stop using it because nobody else
[16:01] is using it so that there there's some
[16:04] Network effects around that um but it's
[16:08] really interesting that you mentioned
[16:09] the the the risk of growing too fast
[16:13] it's kind of like uh what what would
[16:17] what would bit what would trigger
[16:19] Bitcoin to grow too fast it's kind of
[16:21] like the will the the feeld system uh
[16:25] die too fast and I think that's the the
[16:27] the real risk there where we don't want
[16:30] the Titanic to sink too quick yeah
[16:32] otherwise we might not come soon enough
[16:36] with the the life rafts there and people
[16:39] will die in the ocean very well said I
[16:42] think the term maximum velocity is
[16:45] important because I I think if you look
[16:47] at bitcoin's history it has grown as
[16:51] fast as it possibly can and when you
[16:55] think about bitcoin's volatility I I
[16:57] don't know who it was that descri this
[16:59] um recently but it made a lot of sense
[17:01] to
[17:02] me if Bitcoin was just constantly going
[17:05] up in some linear predictable fashion
[17:08] then people would pile into it which is
[17:10] what happens then it would not be linear
[17:12] it would keep going further and further
[17:14] up and then obviously then you get all
[17:16] the speculation then you people shorting
[17:19] it it would crash and that's exactly
[17:21] what we have that's what Bitcoin is it's
[17:24] it's these cycles of fuel demand and
[17:26] then the fear and the greed so
[17:29] it couldn't I don't think there's a
[17:31] scenario where Bitcoin goes from a zero
[17:33] Zer dollars to $10 million in five years
[17:37] it there's just no way it it cannot grow
[17:39] that fast the wings are going to get
[17:41] ripped off the
[17:43] plane and if I can say one more thing to
[17:46] it I think it's important
[17:48] to be honest about the fact that this is
[17:52] my opinion but governments are not on
[17:55] our side when it comes to money and when
[17:58] it comes to the these sort of stuff I I
[18:00] I think the way money has been captured
[18:03] by governments and used for financial
[18:05] repression and their own financial gain
[18:07] and the whole Central Banking Rabbit
[18:11] Hole I think once Bitcoin starts really
[18:14] succeeding they're going to say the Fiat
[18:17] system is collapsing because of Bitcoin
[18:19] it's not going to be seen as the
[18:21] solution they're going to Janet Yellen
[18:23] or whoever is the talking head at that
[18:25] time is going to come out she to say our
[18:28] financial institutions are being
[18:30] threatened by Bitcoin the the the
[18:33] financial system our security our
[18:35] national security is being threatened we
[18:36] have to do something and that's when
[18:39] something happens I don't want to get
[18:41] into specifics but that's when you could
[18:43] think about um the capture happening um
[18:47] yeah I don't know what you think about
[18:48] that that's it's a very sensitive topic
[18:50] for a lot of people this yeah it's it's
[18:53] interesting because I I was talking one
[18:57] or two days ago with a guest uh of mine
[18:59] on the podcast okay where we talked
[19:01] about money printing is kind of like an
[19:05] addict if if there there there are those
[19:08] studies with rats uh with uh addictions
[19:12] with like you they press a button they
[19:14] get a dopamin hit yeah and then they
[19:16] study uh how the red behaves in
[19:20] different situations so obviously it
[19:22] will hit that button as much as possible
[19:24] and uh to the extent that it eventually
[19:27] will die interesting enough if you take
[19:30] the the button away so the not the
[19:33] button away but the control of the
[19:34] button away so you can still press it
[19:36] but there's no dopamine hit they will
[19:39] really fast stop pressing that
[19:41] button and then there's another thing if
[19:45] they have some catastrophic event and
[19:47] the button is not working they still
[19:49] will go to the button even though they
[19:50] know it's not working just in a
[19:53] frustration of let's let's try to press
[19:56] it let's let's see maybe maybe one all
[19:58] of the sudden it works again if we now
[20:01] lay that on the financial system I don't
[20:03] know how much we can lay that on there
[20:06] but uh for me money printing is an
[20:08] addiction of of the central banks and
[20:10] the banking and the the government
[20:13] institutions uh and if we're now having
[20:17] kind of a solution and people leaving
[20:20] that feeld system and and and flooding
[20:22] to bitcoin and the more they inflated
[20:25] the more they press that money printer
[20:27] the more they come to Bitcoin and that's
[20:29] kind of their problem they they always
[20:31] want to solve everything with the money
[20:33] printer and they they they make
[20:36] everything worse and then they they lead
[20:39] everyone to the Bitcoin yes
[20:43] exactly and and and I think the big
[20:45] question is are they going to admit and
[20:47] say listen we actually costed all these
[20:50] problems the business cycle and the debt
[20:53] is actually fueled by government
[20:55] overspending and and money
[20:57] printing I don't think think in a
[20:58] million years anybody's going to admit
[21:00] that I think they're going to find a
[21:02] scapegoat they're like they always do I
[21:04] mean it's it's it's human nature and
[21:07] they're going let me come about this a
[21:09] little bit differently I just had
[21:10] thoughts if the world transitions to a
[21:13] Bitcoin standard the way our financial
[21:16] system and our economies work right now
[21:18] are completely in in compatible with
[21:22] that kind of a world it's a deflationary
[21:25] world based on sound money and not a
[21:29] debt based system like we have now so if
[21:32] we think about the the financial crisis
[21:35] in 2008 it was just papered over and
[21:38] just quantitative easing and in my
[21:41] opinion that is just fraud it's just
[21:44] like basically like you had a company
[21:45] that's going under and then you just
[21:47] printed money to just keep it alive like
[21:49] a s that's what is zombie economy and if
[21:52] you if you removed all the asset from
[21:54] the fed's balance sheet the economy
[21:56] would
[21:57] collapse so in my opinion but so let's
[22:00] say we switch over more and more over to
[22:03] bitcoin those $36 trillion of debt that
[22:07] is being sustained by money Printing and
[22:10] more debt could not exist um because you
[22:14] can't print Bitcoin so that whole system
[22:16] would have to unravel and assets
[22:18] unraveling and people are scared losing
[22:22] their jobs losing money losing positions
[22:25] in government or whatever they're going
[22:27] to point their finger at whatever ever
[22:28] they can and obviously Bitcoin since
[22:30] it's driving that they're going to
[22:32] they're going to say look Bitcoin is bad
[22:34] for you we need to do this for National
[22:37] Security whatever hypothetically
[22:40] interesting it's also that is
[22:43] interesting question what do you think
[22:45] an addict to trucks does when you take
[22:48] away his truck and that's I think the
[22:51] same question we have to ask ourselves
[22:53] for for central banks what happens if
[22:56] all those Elites that are in control all
[22:59] of a sudden see that their favorite
[23:02] truck money printing is no longer there
[23:05] what will they what what does a truck
[23:07] addict do if you take away his his truck
[23:11] yeah well they're definitely going to go
[23:13] Kicking and Screaming they're not just
[23:15] going to roll over that's for sure and
[23:17] that's going to be a a big mess I I'm
[23:21] not looking forward to that uh one bit
[23:24] interesting it's
[23:26] like the the
[23:29] they want to hold on to it and they will
[23:31] do anything in their power to hold on to
[23:34] it uh it's really interesting to think
[23:35] about what what they could do but at the
[23:39] same time Bitcoin grows in power and
[23:43] therefore also polition slowly and we
[23:45] see that Trend already switch to the
[23:47] Bitcoin side we even see Banks Regional
[23:50] Banks switching to the Bitcoin side I
[23:51] don't know if you know about the German
[23:53] Bank FKS folks bank they are offering
[23:56] Bitcoin to buy they having Bitcoin
[23:58] education they Bitcoin not crypto really
[24:01] interesting did not know that that's
[24:03] fantastic they they're amazing they even
[24:05] have like events for Bitcoin with like a
[24:07] thousand partis uh uh people there uh
[24:10] and they're really on on bitcoin like
[24:13] I'm that's I'm amazed how good of a job
[24:16] they're doing and uh so we see kind of
[24:21] already in in the infancy of Bitcoin
[24:24] politicians um company leaders uh uh and
[24:28] and and Banks already switching to the
[24:31] Bitcoin side and that's kind of the hope
[24:33] that I have for a peaceful Revolution
[24:35] but at the same time I have that like oh
[24:37] like there those huge central banks who
[24:40] have a lot of resources yes and we take
[24:42] away their favorite
[24:45] toy we take away their their their
[24:48] reason for existing the reason for a
[24:50] central bank to exist is to manage the
[24:53] money supply and do all this financial
[24:56] Engineering in the economy and Bitcoin
[24:59] basically just you're just Outsourcing
[25:01] all of that effort to bitcoin and it
[25:03] just runs it
[25:04] through mathematics and and you know
[25:07] computer science and whatnot um it is
[25:11] very what you're saying because it's not
[25:13] just going to be bitcoiners versus The
[25:15] Establishment what we're seeing is that
[25:18] when people jump on the Bitcoin train
[25:20] whether that if a person adopts Bitcoin
[25:23] they're going to get wealthier than the
[25:24] people around them if a business adopts
[25:27] Bitcoin that business business is their
[25:29] stock is going to take off if a
[25:30] politician or institution or some kind
[25:34] of organization gets on bitcoin they're
[25:37] going to start winning but I think
[25:40] there's always going to be another side
[25:43] that is getting that Bitcoin derangement
[25:46] syndrome they're going to be mad they're
[25:48] going to be so upset and they're not
[25:50] going to capitulate into Bitcoin they're
[25:52] just going to be kicking and screaming
[25:53] and it's going to be this this this
[25:56] fight between the people that have sound
[25:59] money and the people that are stuck on
[26:00] the ship the the Titanic going down the
[26:03] the one thing here that we have to also
[26:06] think about is the people that have
[26:08] sound
[26:09] money will benefit uh a lot over time
[26:13] from that their resources will be get
[26:15] better their life because of the
[26:17] resources getting better will also get
[26:19] better so their life will get better
[26:22] um and if you are stuck on that
[26:25] ship you're kind of hopeless and with
[26:27] bitco have hope and so my hope is just
[26:32] like that people see that like but maybe
[26:34] I'm naive maybe I'm too young when naive
[26:36] for for that I I I I believe in the good
[26:39] in people and I'm really optimistic
[26:41] about the future uh but yeah I just I
[26:44] just hope that we we can see that but
[26:46] then again I was at Christmas Eve uh on
[26:49] the Family Table
[26:51] and there is my close family who all get
[26:54] Bitcoin but then there's the white
[26:56] family have a really big family with
[26:58] people that oh I haven't seen for like
[27:01] half a year or a year and then it's was
[27:03] like oh yeah but Bitcoin is really
[27:04] speculative like oh how can I trust
[27:06] Bitcoin that that when I transferred and
[27:09] then like oh what about the
[27:11] environmental thing like that that's
[27:12] true right they use way too much energy
[27:14] like I hear all those things and I'm
[27:16] like oh you have an opinion on bitcoin
[27:20] but you haven't studied it all inter
[27:22] interesting so you have no clue but an
[27:25] opinion on that which kind of scares me
[27:29] I I have a a a theory on that or an
[27:32] opinion which might kind of rub some
[27:34] people the wrong way but I don't
[27:38] honestly believe that every person has
[27:40] the capacity to truly understand and
[27:42] appreciate Bitcoin I I really don't
[27:45] because just look at look at look at the
[27:48] world I mean it's people use phones
[27:53] computers microphones a car but people
[27:56] don't know how it works I could could
[27:58] tell you how I mean I know how an engine
[28:00] works or whatever but I couldn't build a
[28:02] car but I still drive
[28:03] one most people are going to be using
[28:06] Bitcoin in the future without knowing
[28:08] anything about it they're going to know
[28:09] it's great they're going to know it
[28:11] works they're going to have a lightning
[28:13] wallet they're going to save in it
[28:14] they're going to have Bitcoin savings
[28:16] accounts and all that stuff but but
[28:19] they're not interested in the stuff
[28:23] under the hood and I I I read an article
[28:26] um my friend Brady sent me this from
[28:28] Bitcoin magazine about the remnants I
[28:31] don't know if you you've heard about
[28:33] this no I have not very interesting um
[28:37] it basically speaks to just paraphrasing
[28:40] it that that there's certain people in
[28:41] the world that are the the Pioneers the
[28:45] leaders and you actually only need 5 to
[28:49] 10% of a population to move on a new
[28:51] idea and then the masses will follow but
[28:54] the masses are not interested in
[28:56] learning about the environment on
[28:58] narrative they're
[28:59] not most people you know are not going
[29:02] to spend 100 or thousand hours
[29:05] understanding digital scarcity and
[29:07] sitting there reading about the number
[29:09] zero and Bitcoin is time they just don't
[29:11] have the
[29:13] intellectual um curiosity for that so
[29:17] it's up to us as the people that are
[29:19] very intellectually curious to keep
[29:22] develop it keep actually uh perfect keep
[29:26] spreading the message keep keep making
[29:28] the tech even better and then the the
[29:32] mainstream are never going to be
[29:34] bitcoiners I don't think we're going to
[29:35] have a whole world of 8 billion people
[29:37] just screaming about Bitcoin it's
[29:40] um yeah I mean that's just my opinion um
[29:44] could I also is that the article by the
[29:46] way it is exactly Google is is still
[29:49] really
[29:50] good awesome even with jet gbd like you
[29:53] you just type in uh two keywords and you
[29:56] you have exactly what you searched for
[29:59] uh even though I never heard about that
[30:00] article before stuff like that brilliant
[30:04] but yeah uh it's it's RAR that I Google
[30:06] these days because I use jbd for
[30:08] everything but it's an interesting uh
[30:10] it's an interesting topic uh because
[30:12] you're totally right all all
[30:16] technology adoption curves have happened
[30:20] because the people feel uh the group
[30:24] psychology that they have to adopt a
[30:26] certain thing uh and it's they adopt
[30:30] WhatsApp because like the Grandma will
[30:33] adopt WhatsApp as soon as they they want
[30:36] to see the kids yes uh picture of their
[30:40] kids and they can only send it their way
[30:42] with with that so so so so you need a
[30:45] specific use case you need some so you
[30:49] need that Network effect uh for for
[30:51] Bitcoin and Technology to really prosper
[30:53] in that that regard and uh no nobody
[30:58] Mo if you go out on the street and ask
[31:01] people like oh how does the tcpip
[31:03] protocol work so that it's possible that
[31:05] we send WhatsApp messages I don't know
[31:07] maybe you f maybe you're lucky and you
[31:09] find like two persons out there and they
[31:11] can actually explain it good but they
[31:13] have to have some some technical
[31:14] background and the same thing is with
[31:15] Bitcoin like it's really hard to just go
[31:18] out on the stre find people it it is but
[31:21] I think that's okay if I mean we're as
[31:24] far as Bitcoin is concerned we're if you
[31:27] if you
[31:28] analogize that to the internet or these
[31:31] kind of Internet protocols we're still
[31:32] in the the 90s or the early 2000s and I
[31:36] don't think for the internet to become a
[31:38] success that you would have had to be
[31:41] able to ask every person on the street
[31:43] how the internet works it just one day
[31:45] it's there and it just makes a lot of
[31:47] sense
[31:48] and Bitcoin on the surface makes a lot
[31:52] of sense then the iceberg is gigantic
[31:55] but if you're a money manager you're a
[31:58] CFO whatever you just got to look at
[32:00] Bitcoin has a 50 60% ARR it has a 60
[32:05] wall it's it's a unique uh diversifier
[32:09] it's a hch against this and that you
[32:11] don't have to to read the Bitcoin
[32:14] standard and understand uh hard money in
[32:16] order to say Okay I want to buy that ETF
[32:19] because it's outperforming others that's
[32:22] that's how I think it's going to to end
[32:24] up we have these remnants people like
[32:26] you that are sitting here every day
[32:28] dedicating your life to educating people
[32:31] and then at the end the masses will will
[32:33] show up but they're not going to
[32:35] understand the intricacies of it they're
[32:36] just going to appreciate the beauty of
[32:38] it on the surface I partnered up with
[32:42] coin vigilante this is the most
[32:45] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:48] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:50] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:53] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[32:56] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:59] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[33:02] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[33:05] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[33:08] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[33:12] watch collections you have the date of
[33:14] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[33:18] there and of course also the block
[33:20] height and which EPO we are currently in
[33:23] I love the level of detail they put in
[33:26] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[33:28] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:31] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[33:34] love those watches so so much if you
[33:37] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[33:39] regular basis I'll guess you already
[33:41] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[33:44] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[33:47] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[33:50] personal recommendation for Hardware
[33:51] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[33:54] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[33:56] gift for friend who has still the
[33:59] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[34:02] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[34:05] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[34:09] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[34:12] to really level up your sovereignty as
[34:14] an individual you have to have the most
[34:17] secure self- custody setup you have to
[34:19] secure your own devices you have to
[34:22] protect your privacy you have to set up
[34:25] an inheritance plan and depend depending
[34:27] on where you live you even want to have
[34:30] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[34:32] move in case something goes really
[34:34] really wrong and through all those steps

[34:45] you even get a 30 minute free call to
[34:48] find out how you can level up your
[34:51] sovereignty yeah absolutely I also think
[34:54] so and it's also interesting um how this
[34:58] this group psychology works because most
[35:01] people adopt something because they hear
[35:03] it from a neighbor or a friend or
[35:05] something like that like oh like what
[35:07] what you you also on WhatsApp like I
[35:10] should oh you okay I should also get it
[35:14] and and and and then you're like the
[35:16] same thing with with Bitcoin you you're
[35:18] in a kind of know in a discussion and
[35:21] you're like oh yeah like I have the
[35:23] problem with inflation is is really bad
[35:25] and the and the banks like they cut me
[35:27] off and like oh why don't you use
[35:29] Bitcoin like what is bitcoin and then
[35:32] you then you come into this this thing I
[35:34] think we
[35:35] are we're some some days away from from
[35:38] that event happening uh but I think it's
[35:41] not that far uh what what most people
[35:44] think I think it it could go faster than
[35:47] than than most PE people out there that
[35:50] think that mass uh Mass adoption event
[35:54] do you also think that that there could
[35:55] be like one event similar to do the com
[35:58] bubble or Sim do this S curve adoption
[36:01] uh Innovations where we all of a sudden
[36:03] have a year where just the adoption goes
[36:05] through the roof it's very very it's a
[36:07] very good question I I honestly don't
[36:09] know I really honestly don't know the
[36:11] answer to that question I think if I
[36:13] could take it in a little bit of a
[36:14] different direction this is something I
[36:17] spend a lot of time thinking about for
[36:18] the business adoption because as human
[36:22] beings on an individual level we're
[36:24] we're competitive like when I started
[36:26] investing in Bitcoin people didn't care
[36:28] now a couple years later they they look
[36:30] and they they they're like oh okay so
[36:32] that's what happens to your portfolio
[36:34] let's let's talk about this again right
[36:36] but people don't care that much as a
[36:40] business it's extremely hard to be in
[36:43] business it's extremely competitive and
[36:45] it's a Cutthroat
[36:47] world if one business starts just
[36:51] suddenly doing extremely well other
[36:54] businesses will notice other business
[36:56] owners and CFO and and treasurers will
[36:58] notice because their their life depends
[37:01] on it it's a there's a different stake a
[37:04] level of stakes I think you can say um
[37:07] and they have a lot more skin in the
[37:09] game so my hope is that whereas us as
[37:14] individuals we're preoccupied with all
[37:16] these other things and we we don't
[37:18] really care that much about Bitcoin once
[37:20] businesses start like meta Planet adopts
[37:23] Bitcoin for their corporate Treasury and
[37:26] now they're the best performing stock in
[37:27] Japan like that has got to get people to
[37:32] notice that there must be other Japanese
[37:34] companies sitting
[37:36] thinking we we got to do something and
[37:38] then another one and another one and
[37:41] that's where I think really a Snowball
[37:43] Effect happens and just a couple weeks
[37:46] ago we saw the the application for a new
[37:49] ETF that would
[37:51] track um companies on a Bitcoin standard
[37:56] and strangely enough or um profoundly
[38:01] enough they're they're waiting these not
[38:03] based on their market cap but on how
[38:04] much Bitcoin they have and you have to
[38:06] have a th000 Bitcoin in your treasury in
[38:08] order to to be on in this list um in my
[38:13] opinion I think that ETF is going to
[38:15] just Crush everything else he mad you
[38:18] have just a group of only companies that
[38:20] hold
[38:21] Bitcoin people are going to start
[38:23] looking at that and they're going to
[38:25] they're going to be at their shareholder
[38:26] meetings they're going to sit at the
[38:28] board they're going to say what are we
[38:30] doing these guys are suddenly growing
[38:32] their balance sheet 40 50 60 100% a year
[38:36] and we're holding money market funds and
[38:39] and short-term treasury bills that yield
[38:41] four
[38:43] five%
[38:44] um there's another level of competition
[38:47] when it comes to corporations I think
[38:50] that's really interesting one I like
[38:53] that like the bundling all the Bitcoin
[38:58] companies together that have a treasury
[39:01] over thousand Bitcoins and weighing them
[39:03] on how many Bitcoin they have is uh why
[39:07] did I never heard that before like
[39:09] that's amazing it's so fascinating I
[39:11] wish I uh I knew the name of it I I
[39:14] cannot remember
[39:16] um let me see if I can find it
[39:19] [Music]
[39:20] um because it's it it was one of those
[39:24] things were once up bitwise let's see
[39:27] what it's called the bid wise Bitcoin
[39:29] standard
[39:31] ETF is one when I read that I was
[39:33] writing something about it for a
[39:35] newsletter and I was just like why did I
[39:37] not think about that like like this is
[39:40] such a no-brainer every company
[39:43] objectively that adopts Bitcoin
[39:45] outperforms their peers when you then
[39:47] bundle them all together what do you
[39:49] think's going to happen it's it's it's
[39:52] so fascinating I love that I love that I
[39:54] wait I think I I found it
[39:57] uh it's uh probably that one right the
[40:00] the the bitwise Bitcoin standard
[40:03] corporations ETF that's exactly what it
[40:05] is wow I love that yeah I mean it's it's
[40:09] up for approval now uh and but you can
[40:13] already see it up bit oh it's like
[40:16] really recently like end of the last
[40:19] year they came uh bitwise files for ETF
[40:22] tracking firms with big Bitcoin
[40:24] treasuries has with a thousand Bitcoin
[40:27] on the balance sheet that that would be
[40:30] such an amazing wow I mean and I think
[40:34] that's just the beginning because then
[40:36] somebody's going to create one for
[40:37] companies with 100 Bitcoin then 10
[40:41] Bitcoin with smaller caps and it it the
[40:45] investment world is so Cutthroat when
[40:49] people are looking at their freaking
[40:50] Bloomberg terminals or whatever
[40:53] just they're going to see these ETFs or
[40:55] these Financial products with Bitcoin
[40:58] and and they're just their performance
[41:01] is undeniable then they're going to have
[41:03] to go through the whole thing of
[41:05] understanding Bitcoin but the numbers
[41:07] don't
[41:08] lie I mean yeah I think this is just the
[41:11] beginning for this kind of thing I love
[41:14] that also for example here um there's
[41:17] would be Tesla of course and mic
[41:19] strategy in there but Tesla obviously
[41:22] has a way bigger market cap than micro
[41:24] strategy but Micro strategy would be
[41:26] weight bigger just because micro
[41:29] strategy
[41:32] has
[41:34] ridiculous that's just that's just
[41:37] unfair that is unbelievable actually PTC
[41:42] yeah oh
[41:44] gosh and Tesla owns 9,000 bit I mean
[41:48] 9,000 is also a hell of a lot of Bitcoin
[41:50] but for such a big company than Tesla
[41:53] that's that's almost nothing um so
[41:55] obviously micr strategy would be way
[41:58] bigger holding in that ETF than Tesla
[42:01] would be that's insane I love that and
[42:04] kept Ma at a maximum weight at
[42:07] 25% also good thing so micro strategy is
[42:11] not all days
[42:13] right I I love that ETF I think I think
[42:16] that's the first ETF I'm like oh like if
[42:19] if I buy one that that's probably the
[42:21] the one I buy yeah honestly I feel
[42:24] exactly the same way like that is just
[42:26] such a
[42:28] no-brainer I I I think um obviously
[42:31] micro strategy is getting a lot of love
[42:34] and attention and it's it's
[42:36] it's very well earned because they're
[42:39] they are doing this Arbitrage between
[42:42] the old system and the News system and
[42:44] it's just so clearly obvious how
[42:47] powerful that is I think the only thing
[42:50] that's going to be interesting in the
[42:51] next couple years for businesses when it
[42:54] comes to treasuries and Investments it's
[42:56] going to be big coin because it
[42:59] is it is just such a powerful thing and
[43:02] if you kind of want to go more into that
[43:04] the business case for Bitcoin that we
[43:05] can talk about that or we can take it in
[43:08] a different direction I would love that
[43:11] what what is the what is for for you the
[43:14] business case for
[43:15] Bitcoin yeah that's um one of the things
[43:20] that I spent the most time thinking
[43:22] about it's just such a fascinating thing
[43:24] because um once you really understand
[43:27] inflation you have to rethink the way
[43:31] you you think about treasuries and you
[43:33] store money and value um if you use CPI
[43:37] as the measure to to beat that it's it's
[43:40] it's a false synthetic metric we got to
[43:43] look at the actual expansion of the
[43:44] money supply is around 7% a year
[43:48] historically and that means you're
[43:49] getting diluted 7% every year and even
[43:53] now in a highly um in a high interest
[43:56] rate environment and you might be
[43:57] getting four 5% on bonds or money market
[44:00] funds you're still not um catching up
[44:05] and if you hold cash it's extremely
[44:08] dilutive to shareholder
[44:10] value uh I mean the SMP 500 has been
[44:14] going up like 15% so in some ways like
[44:18] sailor says that could be seen as the
[44:19] hurdle rate but as an as an operating
[44:22] company you cannot invest all of your
[44:24] treasury in in Securities so well let's
[44:27] look at some
[44:28] commodity gold is not keeping up with
[44:31] the hurdle rate or the S&P 500 in any
[44:33] stretch of the imagination um I mean you
[44:37] can buy wood or any other commodity it's
[44:41] not going to that that doesn't make any
[44:43] sense real estate and the same I think
[44:45] bitcoiners have a great appreciation for
[44:48] Why Real Estate is not
[44:50] always the best investment um let's not
[44:54] even go into go into that whole spiel
[44:57] but once you go through all the options
[44:59] that you have to store value in your
[45:03] business you realize there really isn't
[45:04] any good options and what that resulted
[45:08] in is that a lot of business and
[45:10] especially larger corporations and
[45:12] publicly traded companies have
[45:14] decapitalized their
[45:16] companies they buy back their own stock
[45:18] they give back the cash in in uh
[45:21] dividends to their shareholders um or
[45:24] they're just sitting on like apple and
[45:27] birky haway sitting on hundreds of
[45:29] billions of dollars and if you then look
[45:31] at a
[45:32] 7% true inflation in your purchasing
[45:35] power and you hold 300 billion of of
[45:39] cash that's what $21 billion do in
[45:41] purchasing power you're losing every
[45:43] year it's insane Bitcoin is a commodity
[45:47] you can put your entire treasury in it
[45:50] and it has the best performance it's the
[45:52] best
[45:52] performing um asset in the world and
[45:57] it's perfect liquidity it is trading 247
[46:01] 365 days a year
[46:04] and every company that adopts Bitcoin
[46:08] it's not just that their stock
[46:10] immediately goes up it's just there's
[46:13] something intangible about the the
[46:16] spirit and the energy of that company
[46:19] similar scientific too every every
[46:22] company that kind of jumps on this
[46:24] suddenly their focus switch swies from
[46:27] the p&l to the balance sheet because the
[46:30] balance sheet is really at this point
[46:31] right now it's it's inconsequential for
[46:34] investors they're looking at the p&l
[46:36] what's the revenue what's the forecasted
[46:38] Revenue
[46:40] but and okay let's think about it this
[46:42] way anything the corporation could hold
[46:44] on its balance sheet is inferior to what
[46:47] an investor might get elsewhere because
[46:49] you could just put your money in the
[46:50] s&p500 get 15% more or less
[46:54] risk-free so if somebody wants to invest
[46:57] in the business and the business just
[46:59] holds a bunch of
[47:01] gold that's not very attractive but when
[47:05] you then really truly understand Bitcoin
[47:08] and you adopt it you realize that
[47:10] Bitcoin has now become a lever for
[47:13] Equity growth through the balance sheet
[47:15] which is very revolutionary in in it it
[47:18] used to be a much bigger part back
[47:21] earlier um 20 30 40 years
[47:25] ago now you actually have a perfect
[47:28] commodity that you could put on your
[47:29] balance sheet that's going to lift your
[47:31] business up and what I'm very interested
[47:34] in is not just companies putting 1% 10%
[47:39] of their their their money in Bitcoin
[47:41] it's the companies that realize that
[47:43] Bitcoin per share is the
[47:46] metric that the real game we're all
[47:49] playing right now whether some people
[47:51] know it Michael sailor knows it very
[47:53] well is how much digital Capital can you
[47:57] accumulate how how big of a share of the
[48:00] 21 million coins Can you capture now for
[48:03] yourself and your your p&l your
[48:07] operating side of the business is really
[48:09] just an an excuse or a way for you to
[48:12] accumulate Bitcoins Bitcoin and then
[48:16] whatever smart and responsible leverage
[48:19] strategies you can use even better
[48:22] because you have a very brief period of
[48:24] time right now where you can Arbitrage
[48:26] between between the old system you can
[48:29] issue convertible notes and you can take
[48:31] out debt at 0 1 2 3% and then buy an
[48:34] asset that goes up 60% that's not going
[48:37] to last forever and I'm very fascinated
[48:39] by these companies that realize this and
[48:42] very very quickly you see the only thing
[48:45] they tweet is we've now done an even
[48:47] harder Bitcoin strategy we've
[48:49] accumulated more Bitcoin now we're
[48:50] raising Capital now we're we're issuing
[48:52] more stock now we're issuing convertible
[48:54] notes and these are the companies that
[48:56] are the
[48:57] most fastest growing and the most
[48:59] valuable companies in the world right
[49:02] now what is uh for for people don't know
[49:05] about it what is bitcoin per share how
[49:07] is that metric coming together I should
[49:10] definitely have uh explained that um the
[49:14] Bitcoin per share is just looking at how
[49:17] how much Bitcoin do you actually hold in
[49:20] terms of your shares so normally when
[49:23] let's say you raise Capital um and you
[49:26] raise equity to to get
[49:28] Capital it's dilutive because there will
[49:32] be more shares in existence and so any
[49:34] shareholder will now hold a smaller
[49:37] amount of the total Supply they still
[49:40] have the same amount normally of the
[49:41] shares but they they have a smaller
[49:43] share of the pi it might be a creative
[49:46] if the capital race is used for
[49:48] something that grows faster than the
[49:50] dilution but that is not always the
[49:53] case with Bitcoin since it has such a
[49:57] high performance when you when you raise
[50:00] Capital to buy Bitcoin if you use it to
[50:04] buy Bitcoin and you get more Bitcoin per
[50:07] share then it's actually a creative to
[50:10] the shareholders because you now own
[50:13] your existing stock NOW holds more
[50:16] Bitcoin and that's where also the uh I
[50:19] believe if I understand it correctly
[50:20] that's Michael's opinion on the Bitcoin
[50:22] yield how can we use clever strategies
[50:25] in order to give our shareholders ERS
[50:27] more Bitcoin without um for the same
[50:30] amount of
[50:32] shares I love that it's really
[50:35] interesting uh how how uh and really
[50:40] smart people come together and try to
[50:42] figure out how to integrate Bitcoin in
[50:44] everything yes where we where can we fit
[50:48] Bitcoin in there uh really interesting I
[50:50] love that how do you now see when you
[50:53] have that uh side on on the Bitcoin and
[50:56] the corporations side of things how do
[50:58] you see the same thing happening for
[51:01] nation states as they are also kind of
[51:04] Corporations yeah I mean first of all
[51:07] completely above my pay grade um but my
[51:10] opinion is the value proposition again
[51:13] is the same for a nation state only that
[51:17] it's it's even more perilous
[51:20] because let let's look at if the US was
[51:23] a corporation it would be absolutely
[51:26] effed Let's uh let's say it like that so
[51:30] the only option I think that Modern
[51:34] Nation States like the ones in in Europe
[51:37] and the European Union and and the US
[51:40] and Japan every every modern nation
[51:43] state is inde debted it's it's it's
[51:45] ridiculous with over 100% debt to GDP
[51:48] and
[51:49] whatnot when you adopt Bitcoin you
[51:51] suddenly have a solid foundation to
[51:54] stand on and you might actually be able
[51:56] to have investment gains from Bitcoin
[51:59] that out pays the the debt that you have
[52:02] or the interest that you have to pay on
[52:03] the debt so the same game theory is
[52:06] going to play out but it might actually
[52:09] be even more aggressive I don't know
[52:11] what you think but it the same with the
[52:13] business where people we don't really
[52:15] care okay you got rich on bitcoin
[52:17] whatever a business like my competitor
[52:19] is doing what they just tripled their
[52:21] business in a year Well when a nation
[52:24] state starts adopting Bitcoin that's
[52:26] probably going to be the ultimate form
[52:28] I'd love to hear your opinion on that
[52:30] actually yeah it's uh N I think we will
[52:34] see a lot of things in 2025 and I think
[52:37] we're all not ready for it uh if because
[52:40] Trump is extremely competitive uh Pricks
[52:43] already uh talked about uh using an hard
[52:46] asset and they're considering Bitcoin uh
[52:50] they know that gold is not working out
[52:53] uh they they they know that and then the
[52:55] only option is Bitcoin uh Russia uh
[52:59] admitted that they already using Bitcoin
[53:01] the the Finance Minister made some
[53:04] comments uh for settling trade and then
[53:07] uh Trump is extremely competitive and
[53:09] wants to win he wants to be the first
[53:11] one he wants that America does all the
[53:13] Innovation uh where you see a lot of
[53:16] different uh angles from that but it all
[53:19] leads
[53:20] to I loved how it actually will be
[53:23] released uh the day where we speak um
[53:27] the podcast with with I think Joe
[53:29] consorti I think it is where we talked
[53:32] about exactly that and and he phrases it
[53:35] so nice he said he says there's a
[53:38] Bitcoin cold war going on and we just
[53:41] waiting who's the first nation to to
[53:44] press the button and buy as much Bitcoin
[53:47] as they can uh and as soon as one of
[53:50] those countries is really trying to like
[53:53] oh we want all the Bitcoin in our nation
[53:56] we get get it now that that that's a
[53:58] game over Point uh that that's that's
[54:01] that's the major ma major point because
[54:03] they have literally unlimited resources
[54:07] to do so yes uh and micro strategy is
[54:11] amazing but if America tries to buy
[54:14] Bitcoin that's like a little bit of a
[54:17] bigger
[54:18] Force I think that is the end game I
[54:21] think once the nation state game theory
[54:23] is on I I don't think you could ever go
[54:26] back to bitcoin being this kind of Niche
[54:29] retail thing or having the same kind of
[54:31] Cycles I think it's going to completely
[54:33] change the game and I hope we've
[54:36] accumulated enough before then because I
[54:38] think it would be just absolutely insane
[54:41] um and while while micro strategy has to
[54:45] do clever Financial Engineering in order
[54:48] to print money to buy Bitcoin basically
[54:51] a government could just press a button
[54:53] and they could push it to a million
[54:55] dollars in a day if they wanted to um
[54:58] it's yeah very very interesting and I
[55:00] think Joe is probably a lot more
[55:02] competent to talk about this than me
[55:04] I'll look forward to that episode he's
[55:06] such a such a great voice in this space
[55:08] I think absolutely I met him in Abu
[55:11] Dhabi and I was like just impressed and
[55:12] I was like hey you have to get come on
[55:14] my show aw um how is it actually looking
[55:18] in in your country in Denmark or maybe
[55:20] overall in Europe what what do you see
[55:22] for for the Bitcoin Community there I
[55:24] don't think I'm the right person to ask
[55:26] about that I uh I don't care too much
[55:29] for for Denmark uh in terms of finances
[55:32] to be honest and and the the way they're
[55:34] treating Bitcoin
[55:35] is is Despicable I mean they're they're
[55:38] just talking about doing a um layup
[55:42] skting what's it called uh attacks on
[55:45] capital gains what what is that called a
[55:48] uh where they're actually tax you before
[55:51] you even have a unrealized capital gains
[55:53] tax excuse me
[55:56] that's just the kind of nonsense we're
[55:58] getting over here and I'm just I'm just
[56:00] not interested in it so I think the us
[56:03] is going to lead this my company
[56:05] Sovereign were focused on the US market
[56:07] I think that's that's where the the true
[56:10] Innovation is going to happen I think
[56:11] Europe we're just fighting too much
[56:14] we're leading in regulation but not a
[56:16] lot is happening I think yeah it's uh
[56:19] it's it's unfortunate uh and I I really
[56:23] like living in in Europe think it's a
[56:26] great place to live and enjoy life and
[56:30] but but I don't think it's the best
[56:32] place to build a company I don't know if
[56:34] it's if it's the best place here to to
[56:37] do that I'm doing it currently so let's
[56:40] see how it works out I have a lot of
[56:41] Hope for for Austria and Europe uh but
[56:45] again I'm an optimist maybe I'm naive
[56:47] let's see how how it actually shakes up
[56:48] I actually watch because of that now
[56:52] very closely what uh governments and
[56:55] policy are doing so I I don't care about
[56:58] politicians but I care of the policies
[57:02] they actually doing so I don't listen to
[57:04] any trauma going on in politics I like
[57:07] to focus like okay what are they
[57:09] proposing and what is actually getting
[57:11] uh coming into law and what is actually
[57:14] happening for for policy change because
[57:16] there's always policy change in in
[57:18] politics and I try to filter out okay
[57:22] what is what is important for me I don't
[57:24] I don't care if to do some public
[57:26] transport there is some some improve
[57:30] like as long as public transport Works
[57:32] somehow it's fine for
[57:34] me don't bother me with that that news
[57:38] what are you doing for taxes what are
[57:40] you doing to bring more Innovation more
[57:43] corporations more companies in in in our
[57:46] country that's at the end of the day
[57:49] where it all falls apart or where it all
[57:52] prospers if if a country is successful
[57:54] with bringing really good talent to
[57:57] Austria and bringing really great
[57:58] companies to Austria then they will
[58:00] succeed if they if they don't succeed
[58:04] with that they will fail in all the
[58:06] other things also so that's that's where
[58:07] I'm like trying to focus on we've seen
[58:10] Pol politics with the policies they're
[58:13] doing I I think politics is just a a a
[58:17] clown show to a big part and it it's
[58:20] important you pay attention it's
[58:21] important you you fight for things but I
[58:24] think Jeff boo says it well you got to
[58:27] help the new system instead of fighting
[58:29] the old and I think Europe is a perfect
[58:31] example of the kind of Empire that's
[58:34] going to crumble under its own weight
[58:37] eventually civilization will literally
[58:39] the the the the weight of its laws and
[58:42] regulations will crush the citizens when
[58:46] I was starting the firm uh I was
[58:48] researching actually doing it in in
[58:49] Germany and got very dissuaded because
[58:52] people said that as an entrepreneur the
[58:54] amount of time you had TOS spend jumping
[58:57] through um bureaucratic loopholes and
[59:00] all the red tape and the fees and the
[59:03] taxes that they actually a lot of them
[59:05] went back and and and and remade their
[59:07] companies in Cypress and Malta and all
[59:09] these other places you see the same
[59:12] thing in the UK all the millionaires are
[59:14] leaving the same thing in Norway um
[59:16] there's this story about this bitcoiner
[59:18] who or maybe he was a crypto guy but he
[59:20] got taxed an unrealized capital gains
[59:23] tax in Norway with money he didn't have
[59:26] and he he had Equity value but that's
[59:29] not cash and so he was completely
[59:32] screwed this is something that happens
[59:35] late stage in a civilization I think
[59:38] where the government becomes so power
[59:41] hungry and so socialistic that the they
[59:44] start just taking more and more and more
[59:46] and as Bitcoin Rises and the Fiat system
[59:50] gets more and more dilapidated they're
[59:52] going to have to get even more
[59:54] aggressive and I I try to just not pay
[59:57] too much attention to it because I think
[59:59] it's um it's so sad to watch
[60:02] honestly I I totally totally agree with
[60:05] that uh um I I watch the policies just
[60:09] because I want to see if I'm in the
[60:13] right country right now it's it's fine
[60:15] for me and I see actually some some
[60:18] developments in the right direction
[60:20] that's why I'm kind of hopeful but if if
[60:22] we are going the wrong direction like
[60:24] bye-bye yeah
[60:26] I'm going but yeah um which brings us to
[60:30] one interesting point that I want to get
[60:31] to it fits really nicely what do you see
[60:35] Bitcoin playing a role for entrepreneurs
[60:37] and startups uh for non-bitcoin startups
[60:41] and non Bitcoin entrepreneurs obviously
[60:44] uh is that also in the early stages of
[60:47] startup early stages of entrepreneurs is
[60:49] that also something that you already
[60:51] should uh consider do you see something
[60:54] there uh or is it more l when you have
[60:57] already some some cash balances wow such
[61:00] a good question um I maybe wish I had a
[61:03] better answer but let me let me try it
[61:05] because I think it's um there's there's
[61:08] a great irony with with Bitcoin and
[61:11] we're kind of experiencing the same
[61:12] thing in my company where we're looking
[61:14] to raise some money find some investors
[61:16] but it's it's it's I think I think it's
[61:19] comical um anyone that truly understands
[61:24] Bitcoin understands that it is the best
[61:27] performing asset it's the best
[61:29] investment and it's like like Michael
[61:32] looks at it as a 50 60% risk-free rate
[61:35] or or I think maybe the 29% from his 21
[61:37] models so I think that's what he uses so
[61:41] if someone is pitching you an idea and
[61:43] they cannot give you a 29% risk-free
[61:47] rate well so the the only and and for
[61:51] Bitcoin companies it's especially
[61:53] difficult because anyone that wants to
[61:55] invest in a Bitcoin company needs to
[61:57] understand Bitcoin but if they
[61:59] understand Bitcoin then they also
[62:01] understand the the opportunity cost of
[62:04] putting their money with your firm
[62:06] instead of just in Bitcoin itself does
[62:08] that make
[62:08] sense absolutely and I think that's a
[62:11] unique window where we are currently
[62:13] because you're totally like um once
[62:16] everyone adopt a Bitcoin Bitcoin will
[62:18] not gain 30% in purchasing power every
[62:21] year uh and then it will normalize and
[62:24] then you will have a greater incentive
[62:27] again to invest in other things yes but
[62:29] right now if you're a bitcoiner you have
[62:32] to have a lot of Bitcoin uh and a lot of
[62:35] knowledge in the investment space to
[62:37] know okay I can uh I have Bitcoin but I
[62:41] also have that uh portion of my
[62:44] financial energy that I put towards a
[62:47] company yes and that company uh has to
[62:52] create massive returns because otherwise
[62:55] the additional risk that a company
[62:57] brings because company and startups they
[63:00] can fail they mostly actually fail so
[63:03] the the risk is really high on there so
[63:06] you you you don't want to invest
[63:08] something that then just like loses its
[63:11] value to 100% then it's way better to
[63:14] just keep it in Bitcoin and that
[63:16] additional risk has to have so much
[63:19] additional um uh cash flow compared to
[63:23] when you have a feared investor who
[63:26] thinks in fear terms and they're like oh
[63:30] that's my my cash is losing so much
[63:32] value I just invest in all the startups
[63:35] that I can there's a whole different
[63:37] aspect to that and and and since credit
[63:40] is so cheap it that's what is part of
[63:43] what over levers the economy because
[63:45] venture capitalist and any other kind of
[63:48] investors in a Fiat World access to debt
[63:51] is is extremely easy especially if you
[63:53] already have money if you're already
[63:56] if you have tens of millions of dollars
[63:58] and especially going back before they
[63:59] raised interest rates you could just go
[64:02] out and Loan 10 million for 2% interest
[64:05] and then oh here's money for this and
[64:08] that in a Bitcoin world that picture
[64:11] changes because we have to act with much
[64:15] more austerity and and forward thinking
[64:19] and and building on a solid foundation I
[64:22] think a lot of bitcoiners has talked
[64:23] about this we'll go back to more focus
[64:25] on equity and not on
[64:27] debt um because if if capital is truly
[64:32] scarce if if if it's Bitcoin then you
[64:35] must be much more prudent with how you
[64:38] deploy that Capital because there's not
[64:40] just endless amounts of free money from
[64:42] a from a spigot somewhere yeah for I
[64:46] think one other thing I want to say to
[64:47] that is I read a very interesting story
[64:49] on Twitter just the other day where
[64:52] company had raised money and they put it
[64:54] in Bitcoin I think that must have
[64:57] been last year or at the bottom of the
[65:01] bare Market don't hold me to that but
[65:03] they put the the the raise capital in
[65:05] Bitcoin and now they have a 10-year
[65:07] Runway because Bitcoin basically doubled
[65:10] since
[65:11] then that's a very very interesting way
[65:14] going back to your question of kind of
[65:15] bootstrapping a company because what if
[65:18] you gave a nent obviously depends on
[65:21] where you are in the cycle and all that
[65:22] but if you gave a nent entrepreneur or
[65:25] compan
[65:26] 10 million sets 50 million sets one
[65:29] Bitcoin 10 Bitcoin and then had that as
[65:32] like the golden egg like the nest EG and
[65:34] it it was pure digital economic energy
[65:38] that could then sustain them that's a
[65:41] very interesting uh scenario but
[65:43] honestly I I I wish I had thought more
[65:45] about that because it's very
[65:47] fascinating you can look back at my S
[65:51] interview actually because I think even
[65:53] the title if I'm correct was uh Bitcoin
[65:56] makes you
[65:58] immortal and he he talked about that
[66:01] concept of if you have a business and
[66:04] you want to make it Immortal and if you
[66:06] want to make it living long Bitcoin is
[66:09] your only chance everything else is
[66:11] going to zero eventually everything else
[66:13] will will die off but Bitcoin is the one
[66:16] asset that you can put in there and
[66:18] makes your company live forever yes it
[66:22] it makes you immortal and uh that that's
[66:25] kind of
[66:26] um probably more for cash Rich companies
[66:30] right now I don't know if that a small
[66:32] startup can also do that uh they
[66:34] probably need like more cash power for
[66:36] that but as you make that example it's
[66:40] an if if you put the the those Bitcoin
[66:43] in there and you can uh the startup has
[66:47] more life because of that it has also
[66:49] more chance to grow organically and it
[66:52] kind of takes that um that pressure away
[66:57] like oh like we have to make it to the
[66:58] next quarter to make the next investment
[67:00] round do do this like that I think
[67:03] that's not healthy to to live from like
[67:05] quarter to quarter or from half year to
[67:07] half year and always fight with more
[67:10] presentations to like more investment
[67:13] money a CEO should do uh the best to
[67:17] make the best product and services and
[67:19] to bring it to as many people as
[67:20] possible and not always run around
[67:23] Investments oh like can we have more
[67:25] money here can be more money here the
[67:27] investors should like love to come and
[67:29] like they they should like it should be
[67:31] a different different story I mean let's
[67:36] I was just sitting when you're when
[67:37] you're saying that's brilliant just
[67:38] thinking of a scenario in my mind let's
[67:40] say
[67:41] you you raised a million dollars for a
[67:44] startup and instead of just leaving that
[67:46] million dollars in the bank or putting
[67:48] it in a sweep account or whatever to
[67:50] turn a little bit of interest um you
[67:53] took obviously you have to be very smart
[67:56] about it and run the numbers but let's
[67:57] say you just took 500,000 of it and you
[68:00] put it in Bitcoin and you bought well
[68:02] five Bitcoin you you made sure the rest
[68:06] is for operating expenses you know you
[68:08] have liquidity for four quarters or
[68:10] whatever I don't even know the numbers
[68:11] what they would be but you know you're
[68:13] not going to need that Bitcoin tomorrow
[68:15] or the next 6 12 months what happens if
[68:18] Bitcoin starts going up and suddenly you
[68:20] you might not even have turned a profit
[68:23] yet you might not even have a product or
[68:24] generating Revenue but you're already
[68:26] seeing investment gains in your Bitcoin
[68:28] treasury that I don't know when that has
[68:31] ever happened before I mean
[68:34] because what could you have invested in
[68:37] what could you have put that treasure in
[68:39] besides Bitcoin that would have yielded
[68:41] that result I don't know what that but
[68:43] gold is not gonna not going to do that
[68:46] so I don't know I mean it's
[68:48] incomparable absolutely it's it's it's
[68:50] the one thing that as coming back to the
[68:53] the beginning of the podcast every every
[68:56] institutions family business uh person
[69:00] whatever swimming club uh needs to gain
[69:06] with their their their financial power I
[69:08] think that's that that's the that's the
[69:09] bottom line I think that's that's
[69:11] beautiful and that's kind of a a a full
[69:14] circle back to to the beginning of the
[69:16] podcast I love that um I have one
[69:19] question for each and one of my guests
[69:21] and the question is what what can we
[69:23] learn from you besides Bitcoin oh wow um
[69:27] I guess um what I was always very very
[69:30] fascinated about uh in my adult life is
[69:33] just generally how the world works and
[69:35] just looking at at history and the
[69:39] psychology of of humans and
[69:42] and all of that eventually all led to
[69:45] bitcoin and I don't know if I could
[69:47] teach anyone anything about that but I
[69:49] think once you get into
[69:51] Bitcoin all of these different areas
[69:54] have to make sense
[69:56] and if you already are a person that
[69:59] have studied different things you're
[70:00] you're eclectic or have different
[70:02] passions you're much more able to to Gro
[70:06] Bitcoin and uh yeah I don't know if that
[70:09] was a good answer i' really thought
[70:11] about that I love that yeah really cool
[70:14] um perfect we have an end routine in the
[70:16] podcast where the previous guest is
[70:17] asking a question for the next guest uh
[70:20] before uh without knowing who the next
[70:23] guest actually is and the question from
[70:25] a previous guest is if you had one last
[70:28] orange pill available who would you give
[70:30] it to man that's a good question
[70:33] actually I think honestly I'm going to
[70:37] regret this but I I'm actually going to
[70:38] say uh uh Elon Musk um I I there's
[70:43] something about Elon I just can't shake
[70:45] it I think he's he's trolling us with
[70:47] Bitcoin because there's no way you can
[70:49] be that intelligent and just still
[70:52] futing Bitcoin and not really getting it
[70:54] but if that guy put one tenth of the
[70:57] energy that he put since posting on
[70:59] Twitter excuse me and and championing
[71:02] all his other causes we would have
[71:03] hyperbitcoinization
[71:05] tomorrow I think
[71:08] so and H I think he actually is a
[71:12] bitcoiner i there's no I think he's
[71:15] trolling and I think you you cannot hold
[71:19] he he holds still uh on the bank company
[71:23] balance sheet 10,000 Bitcoin he it's
[71:25] known that he holds uh 10x more Bitcoin
[71:29] than Dogecoin personally uh he he said
[71:32] that on multiple occasions and he is
[71:36] overall a Bitcoin like we I I I I really
[71:40] think that it's just like watch what he
[71:42] does and not what he speaks he speaks
[71:44] about Dogecoin he speaks about weird
[71:46] things and obviously he doesn't help the
[71:49] Bitcoin crowd a
[71:52] lot but I think he himself he he gets
[71:56] what Bitcoin
[71:58] represents uh at least to the certain
[72:00] extent that Tesla still holds Bitcoin I
[72:03] think SpaceX still holds Bitcoin it's
[72:05] not publicly available so we don't
[72:07] really know uh and uh for all we know he
[72:11] probably has more bit more Bitcoin than
[72:16] um most people listening here oh 100% I
[72:19] just think he could be doing so much
[72:22] more I know he's not obligated to do so
[72:24] I mean Tesla they said well we're not
[72:27] going to be buying more Bitcoin until
[72:29] it's 50% of the the mining is is coming
[72:32] from renewable energies well that
[72:34] happened years ago and they still
[72:35] haven't changed anything then he on an
[72:38] xace and Preston pish asks him a
[72:40] question about Bitcoin he's like oh I
[72:42] don't want to talk about Bitcoin blah
[72:44] blah blah it is like and then he he
[72:47] fuels the fire of the crypto Foolery by
[72:51] by stoking that fire and pouring
[72:53] gasoline on it taking thousands of
[72:56] millions of young people that could be
[72:58] spending their time reading the Bitcoin
[73:00] standard and now they're gambling on
[73:03] monkey pictures so I think he's doing a
[73:05] big disservice to people I think if he
[73:07] really came out and said you know
[73:08] Bitcoin is one of the most important
[73:11] things in the world a lot of people
[73:14] would think about that cuz he he's
[73:15] admired by a lot of people and he he
[73:18] also benefits a lot from the field
[73:19] system and he's also um not in a in a in
[73:24] a uh state of pain because of the Fiat
[73:28] system so he he has no real incentive to
[73:33] figure it out and he has a lot of other
[73:34] things to think about um I I love him
[73:37] because he's giving Twitter uh a way a
[73:41] newer life and giving Twitter being more
[73:45] freedom of speech orientated um he makes
[73:48] I think he's the reason why Mark
[73:51] Zuckerberg is now also thinking about uh
[73:54] making Facebook and Instagram and
[73:55] WhatsApp a little bit more Freer and
[73:57] freedom of speech orientated this will
[73:59] ultimately impact all of the other
[74:01] platforms also I think it does a really
[74:03] great job uh for Humanity and he's a
[74:05] really important
[74:07] person but it's kind of hard to see that
[74:10] he doesn't get Bitcoin to the extent
[74:12] that he helps the publicly but yeah
[74:13] maybe he's just like a Bitcoin Maxi and
[74:16] trolls the world and he he was like he
[74:19] just having fun I swear to God there's
[74:21] something we're not getting because I I
[74:23] I I used to respect on lot I read his
[74:26] autobiography like over 10 years ago and
[74:28] and the way he speaks back then he's
[74:30] like I want to do as much good for
[74:33] Humanity is possible so he's like I want
[74:35] to get us a space I want to get
[74:37] renewable energies I want us to have
[74:39] electric cars and he goes out and does
[74:41] all that but then when it comes to the
[74:43] most important thing for Humanity which
[74:46] kind of fits perfectly into his Energy
[74:49] background he's just continually skirts
[74:52] around so there's something we don't
[74:54] understand I think that
[74:55] I think he's holding his uh his cards
[74:57] close to the chest Absolut absolutely
[75:01] really cool um let's come uh before we
[75:05] before I end you before I let you let
[75:07] you go um where can people find you ask
[75:09] your questions and reach out to you well
[75:12] I am on Twitter and uh on LinkedIn as
[75:15] well Daniel Frank I think they'll
[75:17] probably get more out of if people are
[75:19] interested in the intersection of
[75:20] Bitcoin and business they should follow
[75:22] our company Sovereign the Bitcoin
[75:24] consulting company
[75:25] um we we post a lot of things about that
[75:28] that's probably because I don't think I
[75:29] have that much interesting to say on
[75:31] there but if people are interested in
[75:33] Bitcoin and business they can go follow
[75:34] us there really cool perfect and thank
[75:37] you so much for taking the time uh
[75:39] Danielle also thank you so much for
[75:41] everyone that is watching and listening
