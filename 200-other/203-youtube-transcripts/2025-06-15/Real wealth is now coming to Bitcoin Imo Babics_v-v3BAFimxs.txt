[00:00] it's already happening now Wall Street
[00:01] has accepted it with El Salvador making
[00:03] legal tender there's going to be more
[00:04] companies putting on the balance sheet
[00:06] with people who have real wealth in this
[00:08] world people who are actually are the
[00:09] ones moving the financial markets they
[00:11] really didn't have an access to bitcoin
[00:13] before but now with the ETFs you have
[00:14] the biggest companies in the world like
[00:16] black Ro really putting out marketing
[00:18] material everybody talked about the
[00:20] money in flow I think the bigger part is
[00:23] that they control media Outlets they
[00:25] control narratives and if they have an
[00:28] incentive to speak good about coin this
[00:30] will change the whole game The Tide is
[00:33] slowly slowly
[00:35] turning you have an really interesting
[00:37] career path and path in general and I
[00:41] have this like I always use uh I always
[00:44] try to find a theme for a podcast and I
[00:47] always see like okay what is this person
[00:49] doing what did the person do in the past
[00:51] and I saw that you went kind of in
[00:54] Hollywood with Universal Pictures so it
[00:56] was from you really like the the
[00:58] transition from Hollywood to shitcoin
[01:01] casino to uh Bitcoin only and I'm really
[01:05] interested in that path you took there
[01:07] and what you did in the in between and
[01:09] then we have also a lot of questions in
[01:12] uh in in Bitcoin related and to
[01:13] marketing also related because you have
[01:15] been the head of marketing of bitpanda
[01:18] you have been the uh Chief marketing
[01:20] officer of Robo wonderin I don't know
[01:23] what that is uh but it seems uh to be
[01:27] not that Bitcoin related um maybe I'm
[01:30] wrong and then obviously now for almost
[01:32] three years uh the CMO of um relay uh um
[01:37] and yeah so maybe let's start with the
[01:40] first phase where you went from
[01:42] Universal Pictures a big uh corporation
[01:45] uh Hollywood uh we can refer it to uh to
[01:49] um crypto exchange of pit Panda and
[01:52] being there the head of marketing why
[01:54] did your transition to uh crypto uh
[01:57] company was this alongside with
[02:00] discovery of crypto and
[02:02] Bitcoin yeah uh gosh it's been a while
[02:06] since I thought about that uh so I
[02:09] obviously that wasn't my first job I had
[02:12] jobs before I actually started uh
[02:14] initially in London in agencies and I
[02:17] usually and mostly worked on gaming
[02:19] clients so a lot of my background is uh
[02:21] on Xbox and Playstation uh on these two
[02:24] accounts uh releasing big games with
[02:27] them for for a few years releasing
[02:29] consoles
[02:30] so I was always sort of I started in
[02:32] this entertainment sector and my
[02:35] personal passion has always been the
[02:36] film industry the movies so I always
[02:39] really wanted to get into that industry
[02:41] and then with universal pictures when
[02:43] they came knocking on the door it was it
[02:45] literally felt like a dream come true
[02:47] like wow you know I get to do my dream
[02:49] job and there's a there's a lesson there
[02:51] already that uh sometimes I be careful
[02:54] what you wish for because it might not
[02:55] always be
[02:57] great uh the the the movie business is
[03:01] is is good obviously was a great school
[03:03] you know a great company I worked on
[03:06] lots of uh really good releases uh like
[03:08] fast and furious six at a time and
[03:11] Despicable Me Two and like Al some indie
[03:14] movies as well it's really good but I
[03:16] also found out while working there that
[03:18] it's actually not for me that I I
[03:20] actually wasn't enjoying myself it's an
[03:22] industry full of extroverts everybody's
[03:25] an extrovert as you can imagine anything
[03:27] with Show Business and movies literally
[03:29] everybody has a very big ego as well and
[03:32] I'm not really an extrovert I'm quite an
[03:34] introverted person so I was really sort
[03:36] of a not a great fit culturally I would
[03:38] say um needless to say I stayed there
[03:41] for two years but I was not really happy
[03:44] um and then also we were just not really
[03:46] happy with my partner anymore in London
[03:48] so we decided to move abroad and we went
[03:51] to came here to Vienna and then I
[03:54] decided to make a cut and stop working
[03:56] for big companies and big corporations
[03:58] and start sort of working startups and
[04:01] the whole crypto Bitcoin and bitpanda
[04:04] thing came as a total accident I didn't
[04:07] really know about Bitcoin I mean I heard
[04:10] about it a few years before that but I
[04:11] totally rejected that like it it did I
[04:14] didn't look into it uh I thought it was
[04:17] ridiculous um and then when bit Panda
[04:20] sort of came to be it was essentially
[04:22] just me looking for startup job and it
[04:24] so happens that uh bitp was looking for
[04:26] a head of marketing so I have applied uh
[04:29] um and this was 2017 I looked into
[04:33] Bitcoin then properly and sort of what
[04:34] bit Panda does and obviously Bitcoin
[04:37] really caught my eye and I just thought
[04:38] that wow like I shouldn't have ignored
[04:40] this it's incredible and sort of that's
[04:42] when I already sort of started having a
[04:44] skin in a game and then the interview
[04:47] process with bit bitand lasted a couple
[04:49] of months and then I started with them
[04:50] in January
[04:52] 2018 um and that's basically how I got
[04:54] into the industry that's how I sort of
[04:56] discovered really Bitcoin in this in
[04:58] this
[05:00] last month of 2017 early 2018 so I have
[05:04] basically joined just before the the the
[05:07] 2017 bull market when it run up to
[05:10] $20,000 um and been in it ever since
[05:13] then it's amazing and you also told me
[05:17] right before we started that uh this was
[05:19] a different time for you 2018 2017 when
[05:22] you were at um the bit pondera company
[05:25] and then with a small step in between
[05:28] you came I think 2021 in September you
[05:32] came into relay as the CMO which is a
[05:35] completely different company like bit
[05:37] Punda as I remember they have a token
[05:39] themselves as a as a exchange really
[05:42] does not have this really has no other
[05:45] cryptocurrencies EXA they Bitcoin only
[05:48] focused uh and we we covered that on the
[05:50] podcast quite well actually with Julian
[05:53] with Adam with ason we had a lot of
[05:55] relay relays already on and they're
[05:58] fascinating story and Al it's also
[06:00] fascinating that Ulan managed to get so
[06:02] many interesting people in the company
[06:04] maybe we can also touch on that later
[06:06] but my first question would be like um
[06:10] the the the phase how was this different
[06:12] 2018 with uh uh the bit Panda and why
[06:17] did you then decide in 2021 to join a
[06:20] Bitcoin only company and where you yeah
[06:23] before you started there you probably
[06:25] already went in your head with a Bitcoin
[06:27] only mindset right
[06:30] yeah exactly so um 2018 I mean everybody
[06:33] who worked at bit pund and joined I
[06:36] would say that the initial sort of
[06:38] culture and feeling towards the company
[06:39] was very same as it is at relay now we
[06:42] all felt that we're part of something
[06:44] that's going to you know be uh bring on
[06:47] a revolution that we are really working
[06:49] on not just for a company but a movement
[06:52] and that's how really crypto was in 2018
[06:54] it was very much the old world against
[06:57] the new world uh there was yet no real
[07:00] divide between sort of Bitcoin and
[07:02] crypto and you know shitcoins and stuff
[07:04] like that so them offering a bunch of
[07:08] other coins was not really a problem at
[07:11] all but to be honest it was also
[07:13] different of how new coins were added at
[07:16] a bit plan of time there was a bit of
[07:17] due diligence now in all honesty I
[07:20] obviously I'm not working there anymore
[07:21] so this is just what I perceive from the
[07:24] outside it's basically anything goes you
[07:26] know doesn't matter what kind of project
[07:28] it is everything is listed listed back
[07:30] in the day it was literally people that
[07:32] you would knew from the industry so
[07:33] there would be you know projects that
[07:35] are launched and everybody know knows
[07:37] everybody so people who were running
[07:40] exchanges would know people who would
[07:41] run these projects because there weren't
[07:43] as many yet but now you know nobody
[07:47] really knows who's behind certain
[07:48] projects in the crypto space so that was
[07:51] very different there was there was
[07:53] really no such sort of bad taste and
[07:56] feeling towards crypto in general um but
[07:59] as the time went on there bit Pand
[08:02] obviously went through massive growth I
[08:04] was employee number 30 when I joined
[08:06] when I was leaving we already had over
[08:08] 200 people uh my marketing team went
[08:11] from just me to managing 10 people I
[08:14] think when I was leaving on 12 so huge
[08:16] growth over two years it became a
[08:18] unicorn in a time just from you know a
[08:20] startup nobody knew about it became
[08:22] Austria I think first unicorn as well um
[08:26] and going through this process is very
[08:27] tiring it's it obviously has its
[08:29] challenges and its long working hours
[08:32] and you miss out on family life and
[08:34] overall it drains you so after two years
[08:37] I essentially decided that I really
[08:39] don't want to be part of it anymore um
[08:41] and I left uh and I took a break
[08:43] completely from from it as well uh and
[08:46] that's when Robo waking came by which is
[08:48] not nothing to do with crypto it's a
[08:50] it's a kids robots uh educational tool
[08:53] essentially uh and I just did that
[08:55] purely just to take a break from from
[08:57] the whole Finance fintech World
[08:59] completely completely but after a few
[09:01] months I started to miss it and I really
[09:03] wanted to get back into it um so after a
[09:07] few months essentially I started just
[09:09] you know looking around I was quite
[09:11] close uh to to joining openc for example
[09:16] um but I really didn't agree with
[09:19] anything that was out in the market and
[09:20] I was really wanted to focus more on
[09:22] bitcoin only because on a personal level
[09:24] that's what really piqued my interest
[09:26] the most as well everything else just
[09:28] felt like like you know uh not really
[09:31] interesting and this is when also the
[09:33] whole movement started from from people
[09:36] actually focusing more on bitcoin rather
[09:38] than the whole crypto thing and this um
[09:41] this divide started to happen um and
[09:44] then um I get approached by Head Hunter
[09:47] and they just basically given me all the
[09:50] details of the company uh without giving
[09:53] me the name and I said yes great sounds
[09:55] interesting but I need a name so I can
[09:57] actually look into it before we have any
[09:59] before we progress into anything and he
[10:01] told me uh there was relay I looked into
[10:04] relay and I was like I have I've seen
[10:06] this company before and so just happens
[10:09] that I actually seen one of the memes
[10:10] that uh they posted on on Twitter I was
[10:14] like Ah that's way that's where I heard
[10:16] of them and at the time obviously really
[10:18] was quite small compared to where it is
[10:21] now and then I met Julian and for me it
[10:24] was very important that I get along with
[10:26] um with the with the founder essentially
[10:30] um and we just clicked and that's
[10:32] basically how I started yeah it's also
[10:35] fasinating for me some like most of the
[10:37] time I ask people that are now working
[10:39] fully in Bitcoin how different is Fiat
[10:42] from uh fat job to bitcoin job uh but
[10:46] it's interesting also that for me feat
[10:49] is kind of related to crypto in general
[10:52] except Bitcoin uh because I see like
[10:55] most of the stuff that crypto people are
[10:57] doing they are trying to uh copy what is
[11:00] in the Fiat world and put it on a
[11:02] blockchain that's basically for me the
[11:05] whole premise of of of crypto and so I
[11:08] see a lot of um comparison actually
[11:11] between crypto and and field when you
[11:13] when you see it like that do you have
[11:15] any um differences between like bit
[11:17] pondera and and reala you said you you
[11:20] you kind of uh went T tired from pit
[11:23] Panda it was too much or like something
[11:26] was not good there so why it's really I
[11:29] think it's also really fast growth it's
[11:31] I can imagine also like a lot of
[11:34] challenges happening there like what's
[11:36] what's different between those companies
[11:37] and like the culture and the mindset and
[11:39] the the
[11:40] people I think it's mainly the focus so
[11:43] obviously if you are only focused on
[11:45] bitcoin and Bitcoin only um it really
[11:48] allows you just to be laser focused and
[11:50] and sort of remove all the noise um
[11:54] while at bit Punda you kind of always
[11:56] Cho the new high there's always
[11:58] something next that we will'll be adding
[12:00] a new coin we'll be doing another thing
[12:01] we're adding now precious metals um
[12:04] since then now they have ETFs they have
[12:06] stocks essentially they went a different
[12:08] part because they went the part of being
[12:12] a company or a brokerage firm for
[12:15] everything from from crypto to bitcoin
[12:18] to stocks to to gold to B basically you
[12:21] can trade anything there so what they're
[12:24] really trying to do is just trying to
[12:26] digitize um the traditional Finance
[12:29] world with a bit of crypto they started
[12:31] from the crypto world but really they're
[12:34] mainly trying to just basically make
[12:36] this old Financial World digital while
[12:39] when you when you work at a at a Bitcoin
[12:41] company you don't really care about the
[12:42] rest of the financial world you really
[12:44] dare to to work on a change of bringing
[12:47] Bitcoin and Bitcoin being the competitor
[12:49] to the old Financial world and system so
[12:52] you're not really focused on bringing
[12:54] all things from this world and trying to
[12:56] change them like you mentioned you know
[12:58] putting them on a blockchain so to speak
[13:01] um and obviously the difference is
[13:03] mainly that if you're focused on bitcoin
[13:05] there isn't as much money in it as if
[13:07] you focused on the whole financial
[13:09] system um that's why you know that's why
[13:13] the biggest investors are focused on
[13:14] crypto and that's that's where they see
[13:16] the money is and it kind of makes sense
[13:18] if you really think about it if you have
[13:20] just one thing you have a certain amount
[13:23] of volume certain amount of revenues but
[13:25] why don't we add another coin and
[13:26] another coin and another coin that's
[13:28] always more volume and always more
[13:29] revenues because people are interested
[13:30] in it um so it's really uh I would say
[13:35] it really depends on what is it that you
[13:37] want to achieve and and how clear you
[13:39] are what kind of a company you want to
[13:41] be and that's what I liked about real
[13:44] idea was about Bitcoin and nothing else
[13:47] um and the more actually understand
[13:49] Bitcoin you realize that it just makes
[13:51] sense there is good money to be made in
[13:54] Bitcoin as well it just might not be as
[13:56] interesting for the outside world as the
[13:59] crypto one so if you're sort of
[14:01] uneducated in the whole world of Bitcoin
[14:04] crypto looks more interesting because
[14:06] you know you had crypto projects you had
[14:08] the icos then you had the nfts last year
[14:11] or two years ago there's going to be a
[14:13] next thing there's always a next hot
[14:15] thing that people can be like oh this is
[14:17] this is innovation but it's actually not
[14:20] Innovation it's just something dressed
[14:21] as
[14:22] Innovation it's fascinating because um I
[14:25] also see
[14:27] where um a lot of
[14:29] uh Bitcoin only companies they have
[14:32] obviously less volume obviously less
[14:34] money because when you see like the
[14:36] biggest Bitcoin only exchanges against
[14:38] like binance and coinbase and the big
[14:40] exchanges do you see this uh changing
[14:43] because I think the Bitcoin General is
[14:46] really good for business and also like
[14:48] for me like when you take this podcast
[14:50] obviously when I get more cryptos
[14:53] involved and then talk about everything
[14:55] maybe in the short term I have the
[14:57] potential to be bigger as a podcaster I
[15:00] lose the Bitcoin only crowd but the
[15:02] Bitcoin only crowd is just developing
[15:04] it's it's it's a small crowd still uh
[15:07] when I have even lists of Twitter
[15:09] accounts that are Bitcoin only and it's
[15:10] not a long list it's like it's a you can
[15:13] do the list in like a few days when you
[15:15] work through Twitter um so I think it's
[15:18] still a small thing and I could do the
[15:20] podcast about everything some bitcoiners
[15:22] would Al also watch me um and obviously
[15:25] with exchanges and all the other
[15:26] businesses it's the same um but looking
[15:29] out I think uh being focused on bitcoin
[15:32] only will be an extreme extreme
[15:35] marketing Advantage also because you
[15:37] proved to be Bitcoin only and did not be
[15:40] seduced by money yeah and had a passion
[15:43] do you see uh this Bitcoin only being
[15:47] smaller volume smaller um um less budget
[15:52] uh changing in like 10 years when we
[15:55] know oh all this shitcoins are
[15:57] actually or is it a long process
[16:00] over like 00 200 years where we have to
[16:03] slowly get out of this crypto is like do
[16:05] you
[16:06] think yeah I don't I don't think so I
[16:09] also uh maybe controversially I don't
[16:12] think that uh sort of the altcoin or
[16:14] shitcoins or whatever you want to call
[16:15] it are going to go away I think is just
[16:18] going to um they will be rebranded to
[16:22] what they really are which is gambling
[16:24] and I think there is obviously space in
[16:26] the market for gambling as well and
[16:28] gambling in itself self is not bad
[16:31] unless you obviously you know bet your
[16:33] life savings on it and it's I I think
[16:36] it's a natural part of the financial
[16:38] markets there something that's super
[16:40] risky super Shady but kind of regulated
[16:43] it's for for me I think it should exist
[16:47] my biggest problem is how it's being
[16:48] marketed right now with the biggest
[16:50] exchanges including coinbase bit Panda
[16:53] uh it's right there essentially next to
[16:55] the serious stuff so if we call let's
[16:58] say Bitcoin stocks ETFs the serious
[17:01] stuff but then at the same time at the
[17:03] same platform you also have shibainu and
[17:06] dog be half or or whatever it's called
[17:09] like you know I think there should be a
[17:11] Distinction on these platforms where you
[17:12] come in and it's like you can invest in
[17:14] anything do you want gold we have gold
[17:16] for you do you want Bitcoin we have
[17:17] Bitcoin for you these things here you
[17:20] can also buy them just be very careful
[17:22] this is super super this is gambling
[17:24] essentially this is the casino part of
[17:25] our business I think if you really
[17:28] clarify that to people I think then it's
[17:31] okay I find it dishonest and maybe a
[17:35] little bit on a you know on the low on
[17:38] the moral Spectrum to package it up as
[17:41] the as the future of Finance or you know
[17:45] as something as as as um as a revolution
[17:49] or something essentially that's really
[17:50] good I think if they brand it and Market
[17:52] it as something that's gambling and this
[17:54] is a casino and you can try your luck
[17:56] fine why not uh and back back to your
[17:59] question about Bitcoin
[18:01] only um I don't think Bitcoin only is
[18:04] going to in the short term I can't speak
[18:07] about the future but in the short term
[18:09] really get very close to coinbase and
[18:12] bit Panda it's just they just deal with
[18:14] more things the volume and the market
[18:16] clearly wants these other things whether
[18:18] whether we believe in it or not the
[18:19] market decides in the end so clearly
[18:22] they will be contining making money I
[18:24] think there is going to be a
[18:25] consolidation though of these big
[18:26] companies also of the smaller ones uh as
[18:30] well but in terms of Bitcoin only being
[18:33] an advantage I really think so also from
[18:35] marketing point of view in a branding
[18:37] point of view and you said it right if
[18:39] you start sort of focusing on everything
[18:42] you probably will get more guests more
[18:43] listeners but then you also lose your
[18:46] Niche you lose your Edge and I believe
[18:49] that as people uh as companies and
[18:52] Brands you should stand for something
[18:54] that's what makes you special that's
[18:56] what makes you an individual if you like
[18:59] everything if you want to be an expert
[19:01] on everything you will be essentially
[19:03] boring nobody wants to you know I I
[19:06] don't want to speak to people who agree
[19:08] with the same things that I like I want
[19:10] to speak to people who like different
[19:11] things so then it come makes a different
[19:13] an interesting conversation because I
[19:15] like movies you like something else
[19:17] great we can talk otherwise it's just an
[19:19] Ecco chamber and I think uh when it
[19:22] comes to Brands is just what separates
[19:24] you from the rest it's what gives you
[19:26] character and a great example that I
[19:28] always uses Tesla Tesla would probably
[19:32] sell more cars if they were also
[19:34] starting combustion engine cars because
[19:38] obviously there is more market and now
[19:39] we have the Tesla brand with it but
[19:41] after a while and probably very fast
[19:43] they would lose what Tesla is they would
[19:46] lose the meaning of Tesla it wouldn't be
[19:48] special anymore because now they offer
[19:50] everything else you also offer cars and
[19:52] then you also playing in a different
[19:54] Arena then you're up against BMW and
[19:56] that will eat up Tesla right now you're
[19:59] different you're playing in a smaller
[20:00] specialized Arena and there is room for
[20:03] that we are Bitcoin only because we
[20:05] believe in Bitcoin but also it's our
[20:07] Niche and we know that we don't need to
[20:10] worry about the the the shitcoin casinos
[20:13] they are there obviously they have a
[20:15] market share but sooner or later as
[20:17] probably you know as well there's a
[20:19] journey that people go through and they
[20:20] start in the shitcoin world and then
[20:23] they sort of end up in the Bitcoin world
[20:25] so it's okay that they're around it's
[20:28] okay what they do um you know the market
[20:31] will decide whether they will have a
[20:32] future or not I believe the market has
[20:35] already decided that Bitcoin does have a
[20:37] future uh with the wall with the Wall
[20:40] Street ETF approvals and overall
[20:42] positivity towards Bitcoin and the
[20:44] understanding of Bitcoin that you can
[20:45] see is happening more and more when it
[20:47] comes to crypto uh the judges the jury
[20:51] is still out I think there is a future
[20:53] for it but the market is going to
[20:55] decide um and you mentioned um
[20:59] the markets and the the stories behind
[21:01] Bitcoin only and and and how crypto is
[21:03] different and for me it's always
[21:05] interesting how we can Market Bitcoin
[21:08] better and you as a chief marketing
[21:10] officer of a Bitcoin only company um I
[21:13] have an kind of a pace change now in the
[21:17] in the podcast where I'm like how do we
[21:21] make sure in Bitcoin because I think
[21:23] Bitcoin is in in the broader sense just
[21:25] money like it's it's money it's an asset
[21:28] um um it it I always say I'm I'm there
[21:31] for it till it's the base layer of our
[21:34] financial system because then it's
[21:35] boring it's then it's just there but the
[21:38] the rise up to this point will be really
[21:40] interesting to document that's why I'm
[21:42] having this goal to this year interview
[21:44] 300 people in Bitcoin and I'm now at
[21:48] 65 so I'm making my process um in March
[21:53] um but I'm always trying to figure out
[21:55] how we can Market Bitcoin better um
[21:59] of course it will Market itself kind of
[22:01] because we all have the incentive
[22:02] because I have the incentive to be a
[22:04] really good spokesperson in Bitcoin and
[22:06] interview interesting guests so I get
[22:08] more views so I have the incentive
[22:10] without having any incentive from a
[22:12] Bitcoin Corporation to be really good in
[22:14] marketing Bitcoin really has to be the
[22:16] incentive to be really good in marketing
[22:18] Bitcoin because then customers come to
[22:20] really and buy Bitcoin over there uh
[22:23] Services uh but in general how do you
[22:25] think uh bitcoiners should tell stories
[22:29] about Bitcoin what stories should we
[22:31] tell uh if we come to new people to no
[22:35] coers to pre coiners uh that don't
[22:38] understand Bitcoin or have some uh fud
[22:40] line in the head like oh it's
[22:43] environmentally bad for them like what
[22:45] do you think is the best obviously it
[22:47] depends from Human to human but what are
[22:49] the best like stories you you you would
[22:52] suggest going
[22:54] to I I think like you said it really
[22:56] depends on a person I would always start
[22:58] with what the what is the pain point
[23:00] that the person feels um and Bitcoin can
[23:04] be many things for for many people I
[23:07] would say in sort of global and in
[23:09] general what we need to do as an
[23:10] industry especially companies is to
[23:13] really really lay off the technical term
[23:16] and and understand that people do not
[23:19] care about you know onchain second layer
[23:23] and all these sort of things they care
[23:24] about how can I use this in a very
[23:26] simple user friendly way they they get
[23:29] scared of big words and you need to
[23:32] translate what Bitcoin is to just simple
[23:35] terms and make it very easy Bitcoin is
[23:39] easy and you know it as well that once
[23:41] you actually you know start making
[23:42] transactions once you start buying it
[23:44] and saving it and huddling it is just a
[23:47] matter of practice I think overall the
[23:49] technology still has a long way to go to
[23:51] be super user friendly um but it's going
[23:54] that way for sure and in the meantime I
[23:56] think from a marketing point of view
[23:58] from from you know podcaster point of
[24:00] view from content creator point of view
[24:02] is to really take the big ideas and turn
[24:04] them into digestible and understandable
[24:06] topics that people can understand so you
[24:10] cannot really you cannot really sort of
[24:13] focus to much on the tech aspect nobody
[24:16] really cares about you know it's
[24:19] decentralized it's just a word but to a
[24:21] newbie it's it means nothing if you tell
[24:24] them Bitcoin is great because it's
[24:25] decentralized I don't know what it means
[24:28] uh and even if you explain it to them
[24:29] you get they get lost in just the
[24:32] explanation I think it's better to
[24:34] listen to people and understand so what
[24:36] is the problem what is your goal what is
[24:38] it that you want to achieve uh have you
[24:40] tried this have you tried that and then
[24:42] eventually you'll arrive at the problem
[24:45] which probably is they want to make more
[24:46] money they don't know how to save they
[24:48] struggling with the inflation or
[24:49] whatever the problem is I think uh it's
[24:52] sort of tackling it from that point of
[24:53] view I don't like the approach where
[24:56] people preach at other people you know
[24:59] like oh you should be into Bitcoin I
[25:01] also don't like people rejecting
[25:04] coiners and really having this
[25:06] aggressive attitude I think what we
[25:08] should definitely do in terms of like
[25:10] better marketing is to be more
[25:12] welcoming and there are no stupid
[25:15] questions you're not a stupid person for
[25:17] asking stupid questions and feel free to
[25:20] ask I'll take the time to explain it to
[25:22] you um I think that's the right
[25:26] approach and that's sort of what really
[25:28] is trying trying to do we're not really
[25:29] a brand that is trying to be toxic we
[25:32] are a brand that is very much inclusive
[25:34] everybody's welcome um we try to break
[25:38] down complex topics into really simple
[25:41] ideas and simple content that's why do
[25:43] we do so much uh you know so many memes
[25:45] on social media memes are a great tool
[25:48] to translate something very complex into
[25:50] something digestible funny and super
[25:52] brief is just one image essentially um
[25:56] and that works also you know uh
[25:59] educational content we always think
[26:01] about all right so we have this blog
[26:02] article how can we make this more dummy
[26:06] proof you know like does this actually
[26:08] make sense are we now just being lost in
[26:10] our own bubble or if you show show it to
[26:12] your your grandmother will she
[26:14] understand what you're talking about um
[26:16] so there's always this really
[26:18] understanding that you're not talking to
[26:20] bitcoiners you're talking to people who
[26:22] are outside looking in and you need to
[26:24] also take this approach of understanding
[26:27] that they don't know what we talking
[26:28] about we need to understand them and
[26:31] then we can create better content better
[26:33] marketing for them I'm super excited to
[26:36] announce that this podcast got the first
[26:39] ever sponsor 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[26:43] from day one and they teach and preach
[26:46] self- custody this is my goto exchange
[26:49] when someone asks me oh where can I buy
[26:52] my Bitcoin from this is the easiest
[26:54] entry for bitcoiners and if you want
[26:57] lower fees Plus at the same time support
[27:00] this podcast use code Robin and click
[27:03] the link in the description yeah I
[27:05] always make the the girlfriend test
[27:07] because my girlfriend is not in Bitcoin
[27:09] at all and when I listen to the guest I
[27:13] try to figure out or would she
[27:15] understand that is she is that something
[27:18] she can digest because she's smart she's
[27:20] in University she she is working she's
[27:23] she's um pride in in the sense she
[27:26] understands thing but if we are getting
[27:28] to a point where we just throw around a
[27:30] lot of uh buzzword that don't mean
[27:33] anything like decentralized layers stuff
[27:36] like that um or multisig or custodial
[27:39] like people outside of Bitcoin don't
[27:41] know what those uh things mean and I
[27:44] always try to as you said ask the stupid
[27:48] questions that are not stupid because in
[27:50] every Bitcoin conversation and probably
[27:52] also here there's someone in there that
[27:54] is just completely new to bitcoin he
[27:57] just random clicked on the thumbnail it
[28:00] was suggesting there on the feet I don't
[28:02] know how he came here but somehow he
[28:05] came here and he's thinking what what is
[28:07] bitcoin so we should always as you said
[28:09] inclusive um but it's also important I
[28:12] think to to call out
[28:15] scams um uh in in the sense it's it's
[28:18] important to call them out uh but in
[28:22] calling them out you can also give them
[28:23] a platform so it's a it's it's a
[28:26] difficult um thing to do um what I want
[28:29] to do is now is uh when you look at
[28:32] newcomers coming in uh in it's different
[28:35] from bare markets to Bull markets I
[28:37] think
[28:38] it's in in be like I always talk normal
[28:42] about Bitcoin I'm talking about Bitcoin
[28:44] when I'm getting asked and the
[28:46] interesting thing that
[28:47] happens especially in my normal fear
[28:50] chop till then I had till some days ago
[28:53] I was there six years and in 2021 uh I
[28:57] talked a lot about Bitcoin because it
[28:59] was asked a lot about Bitcoin uh and
[29:02] most people bought then and when the
[29:05] town D came with like down to 30,000 not
[29:08] a lot of people uh talked in the company
[29:11] also about Bitcoin because yeah it's now
[29:13] like so it's not in the headlines it's
[29:16] not in the the price discoveries like
[29:18] people don't talk about it and now it's
[29:21] comes again and the interesting thing is
[29:24] uh in the middle of the bare Market
[29:26] people say like oh why did you tell
[29:28] about Bitcoin what it it was like 60,000
[29:31] I was
[29:32] like I talk about Bitcoin since it's
[29:34] like 7,000 so it's it's it's for me it's
[29:37] always the same but the interest is
[29:39] different how is now from a company
[29:41] point of view like relay how's it
[29:43] different marketing for Bitcoin uh when
[29:46] you're in a bull market versus when
[29:48] you're in a bare Market how do you see
[29:50] like uh the different marketing
[29:52] approaches there and do you see also see
[29:54] like differences in like um how people
[29:57] buy how the behaviors are in in the bull
[30:00] and bare markets or is it Bitcoin only
[30:03] DCA it it runs
[30:05] smoothly yeah I mean uh in terms of
[30:07] business obviously uh the whether people
[30:11] buy or sell that's good for us we we
[30:13] obviously are a brokerage um but what's
[30:17] really great is um it's basically the
[30:20] price is a great marketing tool you know
[30:23] when when the price starts rallying you
[30:25] don't really need to do much you just
[30:26] need to be there so people can find you
[30:28] and they want to because they feel the
[30:30] fomo themselves and and when we had this
[30:33] uh sort of expectation for the ETF
[30:35] approvals that were happening in January
[30:38] sort of that that period that one week
[30:40] where people were unsure what this is
[30:43] going to mean to price it was crazy we
[30:45] had really great volumes like record day
[30:48] after record day um and then obviously
[30:51] once people understood that all right
[30:53] the price is not doing anything because
[30:54] there was this like two we period it
[30:56] kind of remained flat it went up I think
[30:59] 5K or something then didn't do much and
[31:01] I think people were expecting straight
[31:02] away that it's going to go to
[31:04] 100K um so then we also started seeing
[31:07] that all right people are now being more
[31:08] cautious they're unsure what's happening
[31:11] um so it really is always tying back to
[31:13] sort of human psychology and how they
[31:15] are and in terms of how to Market in and
[31:18] bull market and bare Market that's
[31:20] pretty much the same thing in a bull
[31:22] market everybody's interested so for
[31:25] example we during a bull market we
[31:27] cooperate with content creators who
[31:29] aren't just uh bitcoiners who are
[31:32] personal finance or Tech or anything
[31:35] like that and Their audience is more
[31:37] receptive to the Bitcoin message we also
[31:39] found that if we do this during the bare
[31:40] Market there zero interest from their
[31:42] audiences so somebody who's a tech
[31:44] YouTuber Their audience will not care
[31:47] about Bitcoin at all during a bare
[31:49] Market because for them Bitcoin is dead
[31:50] done it crashed 40% it's
[31:53] over but obviously people who have the
[31:55] Bitcoin audience uh such as your
[31:57] building now that will always be
[31:59] interesting whether the price is down or
[32:00] price is up so in a bare Market you try
[32:03] to as as we say you build during this
[32:05] period but you still focus on the
[32:07] bitcoiners there's so so many bitcoiners
[32:09] you can still sort of get on board as
[32:12] well and obviously there's always new
[32:13] bitcoiners who enter the space as well
[32:15] and they discover you they discover blog
[32:17] trainer they discover everybody who
[32:19] creates content um but they're new
[32:21] they're curious and they don't have a
[32:23] company yet or they're looking for the
[32:24] great partner that they can use for
[32:26] their Bitcoin Journey uh and when the
[32:28] bull market comes that's when you see
[32:30] you know FDX Arenas and whatnot like
[32:33] that's that's also how crypto operates
[32:35] you a bull market they go out and they
[32:37] sort of Step into the general public and
[32:40] they get attached to to sports to
[32:42] Formula 1 to whatever it is um because
[32:45] then people are more receptive to it
[32:48] it's an interesting perspective I never
[32:49] saw like saw it like that um and price
[32:52] is obviously like a great marketing tool
[32:54] and in in marketing we are always like
[32:57] there's so many many different metrics
[32:58] you can uh measure success with like
[33:01] fuse Impressions there's like conversion
[33:03] rates there's so many different um
[33:05] different metrics we can track I think
[33:07] with Bitcoin it's harder um there are
[33:11] obviously like the price as a success
[33:13] metrics there's like how many wallets
[33:16] and addresses are there um then if we
[33:20] would have those numbers it would be
[33:22] also interesting how many Hardware
[33:23] wallets have been sold stuff like that
[33:26] uh how do you go ahead and measure
[33:28] success of Bitcoin how do you see like
[33:31] uh oh if we hit this in 10 years in
[33:33] Bitcoin Bitcoin is actually a success we
[33:35] were on the right part how do you do you
[33:38] have like metrics or what do you look at
[33:40] if if Bitcoin was successful in like 10
[33:43] 20 years time so suck is for Bitcoin not
[33:47] for a Bitcoin company a Bitcoin yes yes
[33:51] yeah yeah uh I I mean I think we already
[33:54] we're already on that path and it's I
[33:57] think the suck for Bitcoin is going to
[33:58] be when it isn't seen anymore by pretty
[34:02] much anybody in the in the market as
[34:04] something that's risky something that is
[34:08] used by scammers something that is
[34:10] basically widely accepted that this is
[34:12] now uh an asset just like every other
[34:15] asset there is it's but it's just the
[34:17] best asset out there you know how people
[34:19] view gold is because it's been around
[34:22] for a long time and people do not see it
[34:24] as anything risky um how people view the
[34:28] stock market now that's a debate some
[34:30] people consider it being risky but this
[34:32] is more about how people view investing
[34:34] in itself and it's more about once you
[34:38] understand investing and you look at the
[34:40] assets is Bitcoin a legit asset in your
[34:42] eyes and if the answer is going to be
[34:44] for most people yes it is I think that's
[34:48] the success I think
[34:50] we and I actually quite like I listened
[34:52] to a podcast with Michael sailor
[34:54] recently and he was saying that we do
[34:55] not have enemies we just have people
[34:57] people who haven't really understood
[34:58] Bitcoin yet and I think that's a very
[35:00] good approach to have and even
[35:02] governments they're not really enemies I
[35:03] think they're all trying to understand
[35:05] it even Elizabeth Warren she's not an
[35:07] enemy she is just not educated on the
[35:10] topic and this is I think also what I
[35:12] mean is that we have tried you know the
[35:16] whole toxic approach and I can
[35:19] understand the logic behind it I just
[35:21] don't think that's the right way forward
[35:22] if you want Bitcoin to succeed if you
[35:25] want Bitcoin to succeed you need to have
[35:27] a conversation
[35:28] even with people who are really against
[35:30] it and then it's another topic if they
[35:32] refuse to see the facts and the and the
[35:35] numbers and the logic behind it and it's
[35:38] then obviously the conversation is not
[35:39] going to lead anywhere but if
[35:40] everybody's open to learning I think we
[35:43] can achieve this and it's already it's
[35:45] already happening now Wall Street has
[35:46] accepted it where El Salvador making
[35:48] legal tender rumors of other countries
[35:51] uh you know there's going to be there's
[35:53] going to be more companies putting on
[35:55] the balance sheet it's it's really just
[35:56] sort of really The Tide is slowly slowly
[35:59] turning I think more and more people
[36:01] understand it um and because of the
[36:04] whole thing with the ETFs I think
[36:06] especially people who are invested in
[36:09] finance they will start understanding it
[36:12] so far there really wasn't a way for
[36:14] them to get into it and I'm not talking
[36:16] about you know my generation or younger
[36:18] generation people who have real wealth
[36:21] in this world people who are actually
[36:23] are the ones moving the financial
[36:24] markets they really didn't have an
[36:26] access to bitcoin before so obviously
[36:28] they didn't understand it because it was
[36:31] just so remotely far away from them but
[36:35] now with the ETFs you have the biggest
[36:36] companies in the world like Black Rock
[36:39] really putting out marketing material
[36:41] now you can look up what Bitcoin is if
[36:43] you go into your terminal on Bloomberg
[36:45] you know you can type it in and Bitcoin
[36:47] comes up and now it's a real thing
[36:50] before that it was just some something
[36:52] that you really couldn't even get to
[36:54] because you just wasn't part of your
[36:56] world so I think it's happening now and
[36:59] this is only going to speed up this is
[37:01] really only going to speed up yeah
[37:03] definitely if Bitcoin is the thing that
[37:05] we think it is and I truly think that it
[37:07] is that uh money that we all need then
[37:12] all eight billion people will come into
[37:15] this uh thing and we should welcome them
[37:18] with open arms and explain it to them
[37:20] and uh I seen personally in my uh
[37:24] personal life people coming from Bitcoin
[37:27] haters to bitcoin lovers I myself came
[37:31] from calling Bitcoin a scam to having a
[37:33] Bitcoin only podcast so uh like there
[37:38] even Michael sailor like there are so
[37:39] many famous examples from people that
[37:43] hated or made negative comments about
[37:45] Bitcoin and then came to being a lover
[37:48] of Bitcoin a believer in Bitcoin uh and
[37:51] I think uh even if we're toxic I think
[37:54] we cannot uh kill Bitcoin but we can
[37:57] definitely slow down the process if we
[37:59] welcoming people if we are warm to
[38:02] everyone and saying hey there is this
[38:04] thing there is uh Bitcoin and this also
[38:07] how I do it in personal life I don't
[38:09] talk about Bitcoin unless someone brings
[38:11] it
[38:12] up because I have all the social media
[38:15] accounts like if if you follow me
[38:18] anywhere you know that I'm the Bitcoin
[38:20] guy and so if someone wants to get
[38:23] educated they can always approach me
[38:25] always speak with me or just listen to
[38:27] all the podcast uh and uh the
[38:30] interesting part about this strategy is
[38:32] like you just put out that you are the
[38:34] Bitcoin now you you like if you want to
[38:37] be asked about Bitcoin you should
[38:38] clarify somehow that you are the Bitcoin
[38:41] guy otherwise nobody will will come to
[38:43] you but once you did that people will
[38:45] come to you because they have questions
[38:47] because the price went up 60,000 they
[38:50] want to know oh should I buy now where
[38:52] should I buy how do I store like they
[38:54] have this Basics question so that's I
[38:56] think the best marketing strategy just
[38:58] being there as an educator for
[39:01] interesting for interested people that's
[39:04] the yeah
[39:05] exactly that's that's my Approach as
[39:07] well I don't I feel uncomfortable
[39:09] talking about it and bringing it up of
[39:11] like I work for Bitcoin company do you
[39:12] want to learn about Bitcoin let me tell
[39:14] you about Bitcoin it's it's super freaky
[39:17] you know you come across as like all
[39:19] right you're trying to sell me something
[39:21] and I think it's better everybody knows
[39:23] uh you know on my social media as well
[39:25] that I'm into Bitcoin and they know that
[39:26] I work forit Bitcoin company so if you
[39:28] want to ask in fact the other day I just
[39:31] posted on LinkedIn if you want to ask me
[39:33] a question about Bitcoin feel free to
[39:34] come into my DMs they're no stupid
[39:36] questions um and that's the approach uh
[39:40] that I take with everyone I don't want
[39:41] to talk about it but once you ask a
[39:43] question I'm happy to I'm happy to chat
[39:46] to you about it definitely um what is
[39:49] for you in when we look out now one year
[39:51] 5 years 10 years however long you want
[39:54] to look out um what's the most exciting
[39:57] topic inside of Bitcoin for you right
[39:59] now like what's what are you like
[40:01] consuming right now what are you looking
[40:03] forward right now uh in
[40:07] Bitcoin the most exciting topic for me
[40:09] it's nothing technical I mean uh
[40:12] lightning is great we will be launching
[40:13] lightning on relay a bit of marketing
[40:16] but um the most exciting thing is
[40:18] actually this this uh the shift in
[40:20] perception that is happening I think
[40:22] it's very exciting to see the thing you
[40:26] believed to be true to start playing out
[40:28] in real
[40:29] life um I mean just like 17 2017 18 19
[40:35] even 2020 it was still thought of like
[40:39] you know this is a bubble it's going to
[40:40] pop this is for scammers it's it wasn't
[40:43] what it is now and this is just the
[40:45] beginning and I really am enjoying how
[40:50] slowly like bit by bit it is changing uh
[40:54] I had an interesting conversation
[40:55] recently with um
[40:57] with someone in my family who asked me
[40:59] like what would you do with
[41:02] 200,000 uh if it was given to you and I
[41:06] basically said I will put all of it into
[41:08] Bitcoin uh it's like no it's it is it is
[41:12] too risky I I can't do that and then I
[41:15] asked them why do you think it's risky
[41:17] based on what criteria do you think it's
[41:19] risky and essentially it came down to
[41:21] the fact that I have read about it that
[41:23] it's risky and funnily enough there were
[41:28] basically talking about this recent ECB
[41:30] article that came out that um you know
[41:34] Bitcoin is about to die that was they
[41:36] published a blog post setting two weeks
[41:38] ago the European Central Bank and then
[41:40] some some news uh News website picked it
[41:43] up and basically wrote about it why
[41:44] Bitcoin is basically uh sorry for
[41:47] the f word uh so they were referring to
[41:50] that and essentially I think this is the
[41:53] exciting part because sooner or later
[41:55] even the ECB will be one over
[41:57] I
[41:58] think I think um this is going to happen
[42:02] in the next 10 years where governments
[42:04] will even you know even the FED even the
[42:06] ECB governments around the world will
[42:08] start seeing In a Different Light the
[42:10] perception is going to change and it's
[42:12] going to change because of Wall Street
[42:14] because they control the money um and
[42:17] this change of perception is super
[42:19] exciting to see and then to go back to
[42:22] previous question about what is the
[42:23] success then I think it is this once
[42:26] people
[42:27] you tell them what to do with 200,000
[42:29] and you tell them Bitcoin they'll be
[42:30] like ah okay there's not going to be a a
[42:34] fear anymore because already in the
[42:36] mindset of people it's going to be that
[42:38] I have not heard anything bad about it
[42:41] you know I think right now if you tell
[42:43] somebody what to do with 200k and say
[42:45] put it all in Gold it would be like they
[42:48] wouldn't be fear they would just be like
[42:49] how do I do
[42:51] that and I think Bitcoin needs to get to
[42:54] that same point of like okay how do I do
[42:56] that how do I actually which app do I
[42:59] use which company do I use how do I get
[43:01] my Fiat into Bitcoin that is going to be
[43:03] the question not about uh no I heard
[43:05] that it's for drug lords and
[43:09] scammers yeah this is uh something I
[43:11] tweeted about a lot when the ETFs are
[43:13] coming out because everybody talked uh
[43:16] when the ETFs are coming uh about the
[43:18] money inflow and obviously that's a big
[43:21] part like it's just uh amazing how much
[43:24] money they have and how much money they
[43:25] will buy in Bitcoin and how much Bitcoin
[43:29] accumulate and how much the price of
[43:31] Bitcoin will grow as a result of that
[43:33] but I think the bigger part uh and you
[43:35] touched on that right now is that they
[43:38] control media Outlets they control
[43:41] narratives and if they have an incentive
[43:43] to speak good about Bitcoin this will
[43:46] change the whole game The Narrative will
[43:49] shift dramatically and I think it will
[43:51] happen uh
[43:53] extremely fast so it's like in five
[43:55] years we like oh
[43:58] that's that was
[44:00] fast uh the whole narrative and I think
[44:02] I have a Tesla example because I was an
[44:04] earlier Tesla investor for like from
[44:07] like I don't know eight years ago now
[44:09] it's been uh and I also saw how Tesla
[44:12] changed the narrative for electric cars
[44:14] and you remember before Tesla electric
[44:17] cars were kind of like uncool it was
[44:19] like this weird Nery thing to have it
[44:22] was like they all looked uh ugly they
[44:25] all were slow run up and Tesla achieved
[44:29] the goal of making electric cars cool
[44:32] yeah and I think with Wall Street and
[44:36] the money coming in and all things that
[44:38] they are controlling they are shifting
[44:40] The Narrative really quickly which is
[44:43] also bringing dangers in there there's
[44:45] also a lot of consequences in there um
[44:48] with with with Bitcoin and and black
[44:50] rock but I think overall if you look at
[44:53] it it's really positive that they come
[44:55] in and Shifting The Narrative on the
[44:58] mainstream yeah because all of the
[45:00] sudden uh the uncle that always said
[45:02] Bitcoin is a scam he cannot say that
[45:05] anymore or will can not say it anymore
[45:08] in five years because it will be so
[45:10] clear that's not a scam exactly it
[45:13] trickles down and you know that's why
[45:15] I'm also not really worried that the
[45:16] Western governments are going to sort of
[45:19] uh ban Bitcoin or sort of hinder its
[45:22] growth I mean what they're doing now I
[45:24] think it's not really hindering its
[45:26] growth
[45:27] maybe maybe it is from all the F that
[45:29] like the ECB is creating but they're not
[45:31] really putting any real like they're not
[45:34] trying to kill it at at least for now
[45:36] and I don't think they will be able to
[45:38] because obviously Wall Street is now
[45:40] going to say uhuh actually we don't want
[45:42] you to pass this bill we don't want you
[45:44] to limit this anymore it is the most
[45:46] successful ETF launch in the history
[45:48] there is no way that people who manage
[45:51] you know I don't even know how much
[45:53] money Al together are going to allow the
[45:55] government was only elected for four
[45:58] years by the way that they have a
[45:59] short-term view while these companies
[46:01] have a long-term view they will never
[46:03] allow this to happen and now the genin
[46:05] is out of the bottle it's only going to
[46:06] be more and more and more and keeping
[46:08] also in mind that governments are
[46:10] notoriously inefficient and stubborn and
[46:12] old fashioned it change takes real long
[46:16] time I briefly worked in an in an
[46:18] educational startup and that is terrible
[46:21] how how slowly they are sort of adopting
[46:26] digital technology and sort of change
[46:28] it's it's painful for all these
[46:30] companies that trying to do it working
[46:32] with the government is one of the most
[46:33] frustrating things because everything is
[46:35] very slow so you can only imagine that
[46:37] yes they
[46:39] have they're resisting Bitcoin I don't
[46:42] think it's because they they are sort of
[46:46] worried that it's going to make them
[46:48] irrelevant I think they just they just
[46:51] resist change they just overall I think
[46:53] governments don't really like change
[46:55] government officials don't really like
[46:57] change because oh it's too much work now
[46:58] we'll have to do all of that I don't
[47:00] want to do that it's not worth it um and
[47:03] I don't think this will ever happen and
[47:05] it's it's only going to trickle down to
[47:08] everyone else it starts with Wall Street
[47:10] it starts with the financial advisers
[47:12] that work for these companies then it's
[47:13] their clients who hold obviously who are
[47:16] still wealthy people but not Black Rock
[47:17] wealthy people um then from there it's
[47:20] the families the the colleagues and it
[47:22] just trickles down to suddenly 10 years
[47:25] later the meeting can't say anything bad
[47:28] about it because there is nothing bad
[47:30] about it to say because everybody's
[47:32] educated keep in mind even the internet
[47:35] you know when it launched it was thought
[47:38] of as something that is not going to
[47:39] make it that is only a fud is only a
[47:42] bubble it's not going to be around it
[47:44] takes time until people really
[47:46] understand it and they're not being
[47:48] malicious the people just don't like
[47:50] change I think overall we're not very
[47:53] good when it comes to change and new
[47:55] technologies because it it it demands
[47:57] that you change your mindset and it's
[47:59] very difficult to very difficult to do
[48:02] it's like learning a new language if you
[48:03] are in your 50s or 60s you know it's
[48:06] like I'm not going to do it uh I'm I'm
[48:08] already this is already pass me like my
[48:10] parents and computers and internet you
[48:12] know when it came out now they're using
[48:14] it but when it came out was like ah I
[48:16] don't need to know this anymore I'm
[48:18] retired now this is this is not my
[48:21] problem but now they're using it because
[48:23] they realize that you can't if you are
[48:25] alive you cannot ignore the
[48:28] internet uh and the same is going to
[48:30] happen with Bitcoin if you are alive you
[48:32] can't ignore it you will have to learn
[48:34] about it and you will have to adapt it
[48:36] eventually yeah definitely and it all
[48:39] comes down then to Game Theory uh
[48:41] because uh as we always say you cannot
[48:44] ban Bitcoin you can just ban yourself
[48:46] from Bitcoin and if actually a country
[48:49] what whatever the country is saying we
[48:52] don't want Bitcoin and we Banning it
[48:53] there are so many great examples with
[48:55] China they're doing it since 2013 and
[48:58] still like 10 15% of the mining power is
[49:01] probably in in China with India in 2018
[49:04] they banned it 2020 they lifted again
[49:07] there's so many examples of that that
[49:09] it's just not working to ban it uh so
[49:13] they might as well just join it uh so
[49:16] that's funny and and it's also it came
[49:17] up in my mind because I met one year ago
[49:21] a guy in France that uh was not a family
[49:25] member but a like a relative let's say
[49:29] say it like that and he is the opinion
[49:32] that the Internet is just passing
[49:35] by I never heard that in in my my whole
[49:38] life but there are still people out
[49:40] there that don't like the internet don't
[49:43] want to touch it uh and the same with
[49:46] with with Bitcoin I mean there were
[49:48] cartoons of the electricity like uh
[49:50] advertisement against electricity so I
[49:53] think Innovation is Just Happening uh
[49:55] and and people resisting change as you
[49:57] said and this is just the way to go and
[50:00] if you want to be on the early adopter
[50:02] side you will have to deal with that um
[50:05] yeah and yeah exactly for for the for
[50:08] the end routine we have uh the the
[50:11] question there's the previous guest
[50:13] asked a question for the next guest
[50:15] without knowing who is the next guest
[50:17] and I'm um stumbled I'm shocked that
[50:20] this question just came up in the 65th
[50:23] episode now uh and the question is for
[50:26] you what is money for
[50:30] you okay it's a good question who asked
[50:34] it uh now you asked me too fast wait I
[50:39] will I look it up um all right it was
[50:45] mattio D Domino um he has a small uh
[50:49] Bitcoin podcast he it's now silent for
[50:52] six month uh but it's reactivated soon I
[50:57] think uh and he has a really cool
[51:00] Bitcoin podcast but a smaller smaller
[51:02] account I don't know if you know
[51:04] him yeah yeah uh I I don't know him but
[51:08] uh it's a good question and it's it's
[51:10] really a loaded loaded question I mean
[51:13] uh we could talk about it forever money
[51:15] for me is something that I didn't
[51:18] understand for a very long time and it's
[51:20] something that I'm still learning about
[51:22] and I have been working now in fintech
[51:25] or Finance since
[51:28] 2018 um which is now what two six years
[51:33] um and I still don't feel like I really
[51:36] understand money I think my
[51:37] understanding is better than for most uh
[51:39] out of the general public but it's just
[51:42] some something fascinating it's
[51:44] something that everybody uses something
[51:46] that has been around for you know
[51:49] Millennia um and something that's going
[51:51] to be around in whatever shape or form
[51:54] it's going to be and
[51:57] nobody really seems to understand it
[51:59] it's like something we use and if you
[52:00] ask most people they don't really think
[52:02] about it twice and I was the same I had
[52:04] a relationship with money but I don't
[52:06] have an understanding of it and now I
[52:09] feel also thanks to bitcoin that I'm at
[52:12] least starting to ask certain questions
[52:15] and I'm at least at least starting to
[52:17] understand it at at least a little bit I
[52:19] don't think you can ever understand
[52:20] something that is such a huge part of
[52:24] The Human Experience because it is
[52:27] um and I think it's just a fascinating
[52:30] subject why do you think and uh I think
[52:33] about that a lot why do you think nobody
[52:37] kind of understands money or learns it
[52:40] so late like famously Michael sailor
[52:43] told this the story where he learned
[52:45] about money when he discovered Bitcoin
[52:47] in 2020 and he was the longest running
[52:51] uh public uh CEO of an IT company yeah
[52:55] uh and he learned about money with with
[52:58] yards and billions of of dollars uh and
[53:01] he learned about money so late and uh
[53:04] when I look back at my story in school
[53:08] it was never really mentioned obviously
[53:10] money is kind of topic somehow I learned
[53:14] in in the upper school about stocks a
[53:17] little bit because we had a passionate
[53:19] teacher about uh that topic but it was
[53:21] just a passion thing of of him and
[53:24] nothing more why do you think it's it's
[53:27] not it's not teached uh and it's uh
[53:29] should it be teached from early on like
[53:32] from Five Years on Five Years on uh
[53:35] absolutely uh it should and it should be
[53:38] taught in schools as well but I think
[53:39] more importantly people should talk
[53:41] about it in their families so I never I
[53:44] never had a conversation about money and
[53:47] finances with my parents and they never
[53:50] had a conversation with their parents um
[53:53] and me this me sort of getting into the
[53:56] whole Bitcoin industry broke that
[53:58] pattern because had that not happened I
[54:00] would have gone through my whole life
[54:02] not probably being interested in money
[54:05] uh and I would have not had this
[54:06] conversation with my
[54:08] children now for sure once they're old
[54:11] enough and this could be already being
[54:13] 12 13 money is going to be something
[54:16] we'll talk about because it's important
[54:17] that they understand it and why it's not
[54:20] being
[54:21] taught um I think it's
[54:25] probably and I don't want to sound as a
[54:27] conspiracy theorist but probably by
[54:29] Design um partly by Design and partly
[54:33] because we just take it for granted it's
[54:35] always there it's just part of our
[54:36] everyday life so we take it for granted
[54:38] and nobody you know everybody starts
[54:41] working they get get they get a salary
[54:43] they pay the taxes they maybe save but
[54:47] they spend it and nobody questions of
[54:49] like what is this thing that I'm getting
[54:51] how can I make more of it or how can I
[54:54] improve my life with it and people are
[54:56] not asking these
[54:57] questions um so there is no definite
[55:01] answer in my opinion yeah it's
[55:03] interesting uh also like usually the end
[55:06] routine is just one question but it just
[55:08] came up in my mind um what do you think
[55:10] of of homeschooling because I see uh in
[55:13] in the Bitcoin area in the Bitcoin scene
[55:16] this uh subscene
[55:18] homeschoolers are crowing and crowing uh
[55:22] for for children obviously I think it's
[55:23] not even possible in in some countries I
[55:26] don't I think it's possible in Austria I
[55:28] don't know about uh Swiss and and and I
[55:31] think in France it's possible because
[55:32] Daniel Prince the podcast does it um
[55:36] what do you think about
[55:38] homeschooling I I think it's the other
[55:42] extreme of the really classical uh
[55:46] classroom environment if you picture
[55:48] like what a school is you know Pink
[55:51] Floyd in the world sort of a topic um
[55:53] then homeschooling is the other Spectrum
[55:55] I think
[55:56] the ideal the ideal case is somewhere in
[55:59] the middle probably I think and mainly I
[56:02] think what school is important for is
[56:04] not the content you learn there I think
[56:07] it's the social aspect you know kids
[56:09] being around other kids forming
[56:11] relationship and friendships um I think
[56:14] that is definitely especially in the
[56:16] later parts of the school experience
[56:19] it's probably the most important thing
[56:20] high school is to me at least about the
[56:23] people you know the friends I made the
[56:25] girlf I had that's what I remember it's
[56:28] not really obviously I have the
[56:30] education but it's not what I think
[56:33] formed me it's the people I met that
[56:35] from me I think homeschooling takes an
[56:37] important aspect this is the important
[56:39] aspect that takes it away the
[56:42] traditional education system I think is
[56:44] flawed and I'm hoping that there's going
[56:47] to be you know a more of a more of an
[56:51] approach and more of an effort to try to
[56:53] change it and there's already are like
[56:54] there's like these mon accessor classes
[56:57] and all these sort of alternative
[56:58] schools and stuff like that so it is
[57:00] happening in the mainstream as well um
[57:03] but I would see that homeschooling is
[57:04] just the Other Extreme of classical
[57:07] education and then it's up to you to
[57:09] decide well is this the extreme you want
[57:11] or do you want the Other Extreme or do
[57:13] you want something in
[57:14] between yeah it was a fascinating um
[57:18] talk with you I could go on with
[57:20] questions I think another 10 hours uh
[57:23] thank you for the conversation IMO um
[57:25] for people that want to get in touch
[57:27] with you what is the the best way to ask
[57:29] you
[57:30] questions uh sure uh you can find me on
[57:33] Twitter uh you can find me on LinkedIn
[57:35] as well so I'm sure you can post the the
