[00:00] now that I have Bitcoin I know that my
[00:02] wealth is going to be just built through
[00:04] savings one Bitcoin will someday be
[00:06] worth $10 million I think a million
[00:08] dollars is like fairly close on the time
[00:11] Horizon when I retire that's not
[00:14] something that I need to be worried
[00:15] about if you have one you're going to be
[00:17] absolutely fine most people will never
[00:19] have more than 0.1 Bitcoin that will be
[00:22] plenty for a retirement every four years
[00:24] Bitcoin does more than 10x if you choose
[00:27] the worst possible timing the worst
[00:29] outome come for Bitcoin it's a 24% keger
[00:32] you're seeing people that are taking
[00:34] money away from their index funds and
[00:36] putting it into a Bitcoin ETF a lot of
[00:39] traditional investors with gold real
[00:41] estate index funds they're going to come
[00:43] around the great reallocation is is
[00:45] happening they think oh it's it's over
[00:48] $100,000 I'm too late to bitcoin no
[00:50] you're not believe me it's still a very
[00:52] great price for you to get in early
[00:55] there there is no I'm late to bitcoin
[00:59] [Music]
[01:02] hi Bitcoin Dad how are you doing hey I'm
[01:05] great thanks for having me on uh
[01:07] definitely let's get into it I think the
[01:09] with with the name Bitcoin dad the topic
[01:12] already is is in in your name Bitcoin
[01:15] and
[01:16] dads yeah yeah I mean so Bitcoin D I
[01:19] mean it's just a silly name but really
[01:23] the reason I I love Bitcoin is it's
[01:25] allowed me just a normal dude that has
[01:29] been able to save and build wealth for
[01:32] my family have a plan for my kid to have
[01:36] savings for school for a down payment a
[01:39] wedding and things like that so really
[01:42] when it comes down to it like that
[01:44] that's why I love Bitcoin is because
[01:46] it's allowed me to provide for my family
[01:49] in a way that I can't do with you know
[01:52] any anyone's regular day-to-day job now
[01:54] your your savings just dwindle away to
[01:57] nothing so Bitcoin is is really safe in
[02:00] that sense interesting uh and I think uh
[02:05] most bitcoiners are DS like the the male
[02:08] side of bitcoiners let's say like most
[02:11] bitcoiners I think are parents I think
[02:13] like having kids is something very
[02:15] bitcoiner really like like I don't see a
[02:18] lot of bitcoiner that don't have kids I
[02:20] mean there are famous examples like
[02:21] Michael sailor who who doesn't have kids
[02:24] but there they are more on the few and
[02:27] rare side of things where Bitcoin don't
[02:30] have kids and don't uh build a family
[02:32] it's it's kind of ingrained in the the
[02:35] value and and the mindset of of a
[02:37] Bitcoin now and even people reported and
[02:41] or like said on the podcast also that
[02:44] they weren't into kids and building a
[02:46] family before Bitcoin but with Bitcoin
[02:48] they got the Hope on the financial
[02:50] things and the the better for the world
[02:52] and and kind of now want to uh get into
[02:55] uh uh having having kids and being a dad
[02:58] how do you uh make that connection
[03:00] between being a parent and Bitcoin well
[03:04] I think there's two things I think
[03:05] there's there's Fiat dads and there's
[03:07] Bitcoin dads and I think this problem
[03:11] has started where a lot of my peers a
[03:13] lot of
[03:14] Millennials um they are delaying getting
[03:18] married starting family um Putting a
[03:22] down payment down like they just all
[03:25] those big life Milestones are getting
[03:27] pushed further and further back um and
[03:30] you know you can obviously start a
[03:32] family in your 30s and 40s that's not a
[03:34] problem uh but it does delay a lot of
[03:37] big decisions that you're making makes
[03:39] things more challenging maybe you get
[03:41] caught up in your career too much and
[03:43] you look back and go oh shoot I wish IID
[03:45] started this sooner but you know if
[03:47] you're I mean just if you're saving for
[03:49] a wedding or you're saving for a down
[03:51] payment on a home with your future
[03:53] spouse right um and you've saved up 50
[03:56] Grand and you're really excited about it
[03:58] but it took you two years to do that and
[04:01] over the course of the two years
[04:03] inflation's reared its ugly head and now
[04:06] that 50 Grand isn't worth as much as it
[04:08] was two years ago so you're always just
[04:10] kind of caught in the cycle of being
[04:12] like kind of behind at all times whereas
[04:16] bitcoiners Bitcoin dads um you have on
[04:20] average grown your wealth by
[04:23] 63% um or it might be 64 whatever it is
[04:26] um so I am able to grow my savings and
[04:30] I'm able to develop my wealth whereas
[04:32] people that are on the Fiat standard are
[04:35] just kind of constantly on the the
[04:37] hamster wheel of being behind and having
[04:39] to say all right well I can't we can't
[04:41] afford having a kid right now or hey
[04:44] we're we're GNA stick into this
[04:45] apartment before we move in and and have
[04:47] kids at this at this house so uh I think
[04:51] bitcoiners you know bitcoiners have a
[04:54] way of thinking a little bit longer term
[04:57] than the average Joe and you're able to
[05:00] think through well putting my money into
[05:02] Bitcoin I'm going to be able to do X Y
[05:04] and Z I'm going to have savings to fall
[05:06] back on if there's ever a medical
[05:08] emergency with my kids so bitcoiners are
[05:12] able to think a little bit long term
[05:14] more long term than others and that
[05:16] obviously makes being a dad a lot easier
[05:19] too it's inter it's also uh I hear from
[05:23] non-bitcoin a friends sometimes not not
[05:27] friends would be maybe a wrong word for
[05:29] that but people that know uh outside of
[05:32] Bitcoin uh they tell me oh I don't want
[05:34] to put kids in in this world like they
[05:37] they don't see hope in this world they
[05:38] see a bad world coming to and and I
[05:40] think that's where in the Bitcoin sphere
[05:43] that's whole different thing we we point
[05:47] to a lot of things that are wrong right
[05:49] now but we always are hopeful and
[05:51] optimistic and we're like we have
[05:53] Bitcoin will will rebuild a new world
[05:55] like we always optimistic for the future
[05:57] yeah uh which which makes me um really
[06:00] glad to be in this community to be
[06:01] honest and have this optimistic view of
[06:04] the world yeah you know I think that
[06:06] whole oh I don't want to have kids
[06:08] because this world is such an ugly place
[06:11] that's just a that is just a scop
[06:14] that governments have have put on us or
[06:17] Society media whatever you call it has
[06:19] put on us to discourage having kids like
[06:22] having kids is a blessing um even if
[06:25] you're on the Fiat standard it's it's
[06:27] it's a blessing no matter what it's
[06:29] certainly hard hard on the Fiat standard
[06:31] it's it's harder to have a family and to
[06:34] um have the money to provide for them
[06:35] and to have a a kind of a safety net if
[06:37] you will but H having kids is a blessing
[06:41] you know it's something that I wish I
[06:42] could have even done sooner um I'm of
[06:44] course happy with my story and grateful
[06:46] for everything too um but I think that's
[06:50] kind of a false narrative that has been
[06:52] given to us I know people have said like
[06:54] well what's happening with the
[06:56] environment or what's happening in
[06:58] politics there's a a lot of reasons to
[07:00] be optimistic Bitcoin certainly makes me
[07:02] optimistic about the future uh I know
[07:05] like Global poverty has dwindled too if
[07:08] you look at un numbers um there's a ton
[07:11] of reasons to be optimistic about the
[07:13] future and why you should bring kids
[07:15] into the world yeah and uh it's it's
[07:17] kind
[07:18] of nature heals itself because those
[07:20] people that like oh like I don't want to
[07:22] put kids and they were like their DNA is
[07:25] not getting spread yeah like nature is
[07:29] is healing itself with with that anyways
[07:31] long yeah bitcoiners go have kids we
[07:34] need you we need to spread the Bitcoin
[07:37] uh Jean I love that yeah um it's also I
[07:40] feel like it nobody benefits from having
[07:43] less kids like there there's no benefit
[07:46] uh to humanity for that I never get that
[07:48] argument even if you're like even even
[07:51] if you believe in a socialist system
[07:54] where there's like a pension and there's
[07:55] a state in in in in there you need kids
[07:59] in order for them to uh pay taxes when
[08:02] you are old for the pension system to
[08:05] work if you believe in that system I
[08:06] don't believe in that system but if you
[08:08] believe in that you need kids you need
[08:10] people that pay taxes when you are old
[08:12] and cannot work anymore right I mean
[08:15] purely from a like as
[08:18] a um purely from like a secular and a
[08:22] like just the math right um a larger
[08:26] population typically equates to a more
[08:29] productive population so countries do
[08:32] need a kind of sustained growth in order
[08:35] for their economies to grow and it's
[08:38] going to cause big issu I mean if you
[08:40] look at countries like Japan or Russia
[08:43] where their populations are are
[08:45] plummeting in terms of their replacement
[08:47] rates um they have severe problems on
[08:51] their hand um in terms of like who's
[08:53] filling jobs uh what kind of families
[08:56] are being created um and like what how
[08:58] it's going to affect their real estate
[09:00] too so um yeah and nation states need a
[09:04] growing population in order to sustain
[09:06] their economic growth um and to survive
[09:09] frankly too um you start to see kind of
[09:12] odd things happen u in these countries
[09:14] where uh you have dwindling populations
[09:17] too um so yeah I I always tell people
[09:20] like having kids is a blessing you
[09:22] should you should absolutely do it yeah
[09:26] I always know the Austrian States but I
[09:28] think it's the same for whole Europe
[09:29] probably also for America um we have
[09:32] currently 8 million people in Austria
[09:34] and very small uh and there are each
[09:37] year currently around 250,000 people
[09:41] leaving more leaving the working system
[09:44] versus coming into the working system so
[09:46] we we're getting less and less working
[09:48] people because there are not a lot of
[09:50] people coming in and the population gets
[09:52] older and and they're not working
[09:54] anymore in retirement and that that
[09:56] whole thing is is is not working out I
[09:58] mean social the social security system
[10:00] in itself I think is probably not
[10:02] working out uh you should not rely on
[10:04] that that's that's that's why we have
[10:06] Bitcoin and that's what yeah yeah I'm
[10:08] not counting on a penny of that thing
[10:11] yeah I certainly paid into it but I'm
[10:12] not counting on a penny from Social
[10:14] Security so but I mean that gets back to
[10:17] bitcoin right of you know I I I once had
[10:22] this like looming fear of you know how
[10:25] the hell am I going to be able to ever
[10:26] retire right um like how am I going to
[10:29] saved for this thing you you start to
[10:31] hear like oh you know it was once if I
[10:34] have a million dollars by the time I
[10:35] retire I I'll be fine that's really just
[10:38] no longer the case um by any means and
[10:40] that's only going to get much much worse
[10:43] um so I used to think I mean how am I
[10:46] going to do this I have to work this
[10:47] many years and make this much money and
[10:50] now I I don't sweat about that at all um
[10:53] I mean one I'm not one to really be I'm
[10:55] not eager for retirement by any means I
[10:57] I enjoy working and creating value and I
[11:00] I get fun out of it I enjoy it um but
[11:03] really in terms of like if I if I had to
[11:06] retire um now that I I have Bitcoin I
[11:09] know that my wealth is going to be just
[11:11] built through savings so when I you know
[11:14] retire however many years from now um
[11:17] that's not something that I need to be
[11:19] worried about by any means so I'll be
[11:22] able to draw on on small amounts of my
[11:24] Bitcoin or or take a loan against it you
[11:26] know my hope is to pass along as much as
[11:29] I possibly can uh to kidss and causes I
[11:32] care about but um I know that my
[11:34] retirement is completely secure at this
[11:36] point do you calculate how many Bitcoins
[11:40] you have how many Bitcoins you
[11:41] potentially need if if you want to
[11:43] actually retire obviously like I I I'm
[11:46] 26 I'm working all day long what I want
[11:48] to work that's kind of for me retirement
[11:50] it's like I I do a lot of work I
[11:53] probably cannot sustain myself hold my
[11:55] life if I'm stop working now but I do
[11:59] what what I love and that's kind of for
[12:00] me retirement but if we take the the
[12:04] retirement term of like you can do
[12:07] nothing and still be fine do you have
[12:09] those calculations for yourself or like
[12:12] okay like that that amount I need for a
[12:13] family you know I haven't done the the
[12:16] hard math if you will but I absolutely
[12:19] believe that one Bitcoin will someday be
[12:22] worth1 million in USD um that's a long
[12:26] ways away I think a million dollars is
[12:28] like Fair
[12:30] close on the time Horizon so at this
[12:33] point I've stopped caring about the math
[12:35] because I've achieved more than one
[12:37] Bitcoin so I'm not really worried in
[12:39] that sense I think if you have one
[12:41] you're going to be absolutely fine if
[12:43] your time Horizon for a retirement is 20
[12:47] 30 40 years from now so um I don't think
[12:49] you need to do much math beyond that um
[12:52] so if you have if you have less than
[12:54] that U then there is maybe more of a
[12:56] calculation to be made um and most
[12:58] people will never have more than 0.1
[13:01] Bitcoin right um but I think if that's a
[13:05] that's a certainly a number that would
[13:07] be worthy of achieving too um getting to
[13:10] 0.1 um I think someday that will be
[13:13] plenty for a retirement certainly not
[13:15] now you can't retire today on 0.1 but
[13:19] someday in the future I think that's
[13:21] entirely possible yeah I mean it's
[13:23] already 10 grand it's it's it's kind of
[13:25] fascinating that that Bitcoin already is
[13:28] grown so much when you think about like
[13:30] oh five years ago uh what five years ago
[13:33] would be uh
[13:36] 2009 would be beginning of 2020
[13:39] beginning of 2020 we had prices of like
[13:41] 3,000 coin I think like in in the in the
[13:44] really low dip uh that's like a 30X in
[13:49] five years if we take this price today
[13:52] and and the lowest of of five years ago
[13:54] I mean it's obviously picking time
[13:56] frames and then like you can pick a good
[13:58] time frame but it it's kind of showing
[14:01] the power that it's always interesting
[14:03] for me with with with like oh like I
[14:05] believe Bitcoin is going to that number
[14:07] and that number um I I always assume
[14:10] that you're talking without
[14:12] inflation yeah yeah well you know to I
[14:16] believe I believe every four years
[14:18] Bitcoin does more than 10x um people can
[14:22] correct me in the comments if you will
[14:23] but uh I believe that is the case that
[14:25] it more than 10x is and I know that the
[14:28] the worst if you choose the worst
[14:30] possible timing the worst outcome for
[14:33] Bitcoin is that I think it's a a
[14:36] 24% um keger so in terms of your your
[14:40] possible returns it's it's it's
[14:42] incredible uh but yeah there is kind of
[14:44] a it's it's twofold right it's you know
[14:47] how bad does inflation get in terms of
[14:49] inflating the price of Bitcoin but also
[14:52] how valuable does Bitcoin become in
[14:54] terms of people's asset allocations all
[14:58] converge in on bitcoin so that I think
[15:02] is what we're seeing a lot right now um
[15:04] yes certainly inflation is is helping
[15:07] the price of Bitcoin but I think you're
[15:09] starting to see I mean certainly people
[15:10] like myself or I've done this over the
[15:12] last few years um but you're starting to
[15:14] see Real Estate Investors saying you
[15:16] know this Bitcoin thing makes a lot more
[15:18] sense like maybe I should part with one
[15:20] of my rental properties uh you're seeing
[15:22] people that are taking money away from
[15:24] their index funds and putting it into a
[15:27] Bitcoin ETF um or simply exiting from
[15:30] their Index Fund to buy the real thing
[15:33] Bitcoin so you're going to start to see
[15:36] people the great reallocation is is
[15:39] happening where people are learning hey
[15:42] I'm I'm a serious investor I've got this
[15:44] plan for retirement it's no longer
[15:46] working or there's a better path and the
[15:49] flight to Quality has begun for for
[15:51] retail investors too um and Wall Street
[15:54] for that matter so um you're going to
[15:56] start to see price appreciation much
[15:58] more from also just people learning
[16:01] about this thing and wanting to convert
[16:03] their existing assets into
[16:05] Bitcoin absolutely and it's it's a great
[16:08] point of uh like the the one side of of
[16:11] Bitcoin growing is just like absorbing
[16:14] more financial energy from other assets
[16:16] and the other thing is if we measure
[16:18] Bitcoin in an asset and this asset which
[16:21] we are measuring it is the US dollar and
[16:24] this as the US dollar is devaluing
[16:26] itself uh then it also inflates surpris
[16:29] it's just like yeah so that's why I'm
[16:31] like when people uh throw prices at me
[16:35] and it's super fun with with Norm oh
[16:37] like oh do you believe Bitcoin could be
[16:39] half a million one day I'm like yeah
[16:40] sure oh but what about a million and
[16:43] yeah yeah sure and like what about 20
[16:45] million yeah yeah sure like at some
[16:47] point this feat thing will be worth less
[16:49] and then every every price to Infinity
[16:53] will be true for
[16:55] Bitcoin some point but obviously uh
[16:58] that's not purchasing power and and we
[17:00] kind of want to have purchasing power I
[17:02] like measuring Bitcoin in Gold like how
[17:05] how how Bitcoin is growing in Gold terms
[17:08] which is makes more sense for me I think
[17:10] long term you know funny enough so that
[17:13] was one of my biggest Hang-Ups uh for
[17:15] becoming a real bitcoiner if you will
[17:18] was I I really started as a gold bug
[17:20] where I you know I kind of told you
[17:22] earlier where I was how am I going to
[17:24] solve this retirement thing so I was
[17:26] like okay gold gold real estate that
[17:29] makes the most sense in terms of where
[17:31] to allocate my funds I want something
[17:33] real tangible I want something that has
[17:36] intrinsic value um I've learned a lot
[17:38] since but um you know I I remember I I
[17:41] watched like a I think it's like
[17:43] two-hour debate of Michael sailor
[17:45] debating someone about gold versus
[17:47] Bitcoin and what has a greater you know
[17:50] sound sound money and that that's when I
[17:53] parted with all my gold and I remember
[17:55] having to like put it all in a bag and
[17:57] going to a coin store and the thing was
[17:59] physically really heavy to bring in
[18:02] there and it was just so silly thinking
[18:04] through like how I thought that was the
[18:07] right move but uh I mean it took me a
[18:10] while to really kind of understand the
[18:12] principles if you will um but that was
[18:14] one of my best trades ever was
[18:16] exchanging my medals my gold and silver
[18:18] for for Bitcoin so um again I really
[18:21] think that a lot of traditional
[18:23] investors with gold real estate index
[18:26] funds they're going to come around they
[18:28] they understand that hey saving is not
[18:30] enough I have to invest um in order to
[18:34] earn some kind
[18:35] of either yield on on my investment
[18:39] through dividends or I have to have
[18:41] price appreciation in some sense I have
[18:43] to beat the the seven to eight inflation
[18:46] that's G that's going to be there every
[18:47] year really you and I know that's
[18:49] probably closer to 10
[18:52] 15% U but but people's education it
[18:55] takes time but it gets
[18:57] there I want to show that I think you
[19:00] probably mean that interview against M
[19:04] and Frank giostra that's at least the
[19:06] one that is extremely popular I think he
[19:09] only did that one actually the Bitcoin
[19:11] versus gold debate that's such a great
[19:13] video like uh oh wait does any you see
[19:17] it still no wait uh oh now sorry sorry I
[19:21] forgot to there it is yeah I forgot to
[19:24] click the share
[19:26] button now now now everyone sees it also
[19:29] um this video is literally the best
[19:32] video when it comes Bitcoin versus gold
[19:34] debate there are two three other ones
[19:36] that are really good but I think that's
[19:38] just uh an amazing one where you see two
[19:41] people also the gold guy that are um
[19:45] calmly and uh intelligently argumenting
[19:48] and not just hating on each other like
[19:52] everywhere where where there's Peter
[19:54] shiff in there it's just like a hate
[19:56] debate and I'm not interested in that
[19:58] it's kind of a waste of a time maybe
[20:00] it's nice entertainment but it's not uh
[20:03] you don't learn anything so I can really
[20:06] highly um um recommend watching that
[20:09] it's a it's a really great video I think
[20:11] I watch it already twice I learned so
[20:14] much and every time I watch it I'm like
[20:15] oh [ __ ] I never thought about that I
[20:18] already I already owned Bitcoin at the
[20:21] time when I watched that video but I
[20:22] still owned my Metals this video
[20:25] convinced me to sell my medals um it was
[20:28] is what got me over the hump of
[20:31] understanding how Bitcoin is a much
[20:33] greater form of sound money um than gold
[20:36] so I mean he broke it down by each of
[20:38] the principles um I mean there's some
[20:41] obvious ones right like portability like
[20:42] I told you I had to put put this giant
[20:45] bag together and have to lift it into
[20:47] that office to sell um to sell those
[20:50] Metals but I mean beyond that right so
[20:53] divisibility I mean there's just so many
[20:54] more things that that make Bitcoin a
[20:56] greater form of sound money so so um
[20:59] that that was a really big piece of my
[21:01] my Bitcoin education it was such a clear
[21:04] one uh if if you look at that debate and
[21:06] you come out out end and you're like oh
[21:09] yeah gold is a good
[21:12] idea that I think cannot happen like you
[21:14] have to have a big bias for for that
[21:17] yeah really interesting um uh maybe
[21:20] let's let's come back to the that thing
[21:23] um a question that I ask myself because
[21:26] I'm a young guy and I'm I'm slowly
[21:27] slowly
[21:29] asking myself those questions when is
[21:31] the best time to be a dad I mean I say's
[21:35] as young as possible um you know I
[21:39] think the the world's kind of pushed
[21:41] that timeline back as much as they can
[21:44] and to me you know every you know my my
[21:50] baby came it was like a day or too late
[21:52] and I had a friend at the same time
[21:54] where their baby arrived two weeks early
[21:57] I told them like wow so cool you get two
[22:00] extra weeks with your kid in life um you
[22:04] know if I think through kind of my
[22:06] daughter and the time that I have with
[22:08] her you know I want as much as possible
[22:10] right um where I want to see her as an
[22:13] adult I want to see her with her own
[22:15] family and things so being able to have
[22:18] that time with her is is extremely
[22:19] valuable and the more you push that off
[22:22] the less time that you get right um so I
[22:25] I remember to like I'm sure you've had
[22:27] friends or maybe you've said yourself
[22:29] too I think I'm guilty of this of you
[22:31] know I I've once said like oh man I
[22:33] don't I don't know if I want to be 95
[22:35] years old and what my health looks like
[22:37] and all that now I'm like yeah I want to
[22:38] go as long as I possibly can um because
[22:41] that means I get more time with with my
[22:43] daughter gets more I get more time with
[22:45] my with my wife so um your your
[22:48] perspective changes on those kind of
[22:49] things so like the more time you're able
[22:51] to get back um and to have with your
[22:54] potential family is a is a huge blessing
[22:57] so the best time was yesterday the next
[23:00] best time is is today so um get started
[23:03] as you can and we we we're hearing a lot
[23:05] of uh stories on the on this channel of
[23:09] like how Bitcoin kind of evolved their
[23:12] life or like how Bitcoin changed their
[23:14] life uh and maybe we can also get into
[23:16] this but I think more interesting with a
[23:18] Bitcoin dat is like how did Bitcoin
[23:20] change you but also how did being a dad
[23:23] change you and and maybe did you see
[23:25] some parallels like similar learnings
[23:28] that you had both of them yeah I mean
[23:29] I'll tell you I mean the biggest one
[23:31] without a doubt so when I became a
[23:34] bitcoiner I definitely started thinking
[23:36] through things in a much more long-term
[23:39] sense um so just unnecessary expenses
[23:42] right I you know every time I I buy
[23:44] something that maybe isn't necess
[23:46] necessary I think through man should I
[23:50] buy Bitcoin instead right would that be
[23:52] a better better use of my money and the
[23:54] answer is almost always yes uh now of
[23:57] course I I want to live life too and
[23:59] like there's nothing wrong with the
[24:01] occasional like vacation or something
[24:03] like that right uh but you start to
[24:05] Think Through of you know what's a
[24:07] better longer term use of your funds
[24:09] when you become a dad that increases 10x
[24:13] you start to really think through your
[24:14] decisions of not just like your own
[24:17] financial future or your future for your
[24:19] um for you and your spouse um but you
[24:22] start thinking through like decisions in
[24:24] terms of many many decades um and what
[24:27] your financial decisions mean after your
[24:30] life too um you know I want to again
[24:32] pass along as much as I can um and try
[24:35] to think generationally uh as as much as
[24:38] I possibly can too um before I was a dad
[24:40] I never thought about like you know I
[24:43] wonder what my grandkids will be doing
[24:45] will they be secure now that's that's
[24:48] actually a thought that I have of you
[24:50] know how can I provide or establish kind
[24:52] of a baseline for uh future family
[24:54] members um down the road so that's
[24:57] absolutely something that start to your
[24:59] your sense of time really is refined in
[25:02] that sense interesting when you think
[25:05] about people uh that say oh I I don't
[25:08] want to have kids uh maybe they say like
[25:12] oh like they're costing too much or like
[25:14] they take too much of my freedom um what
[25:17] do you what would you say to them why
[25:20] being a dad is is is such a great idea
[25:23] yeah I mean kids challenge you it's it's
[25:24] it's it's hard right so I'm not going to
[25:27] deny that charge
[25:28] um I'll I'll say this I think they they
[25:31] challenge you in in the best way so yeah
[25:35] initially when you have you're gonna
[25:36] you're GNA start to lose some sleep um
[25:38] you're not going to be able to get to
[25:39] the gym as much but then you're going to
[25:41] start to become better um you start to
[25:43] see hey my time is really compressed and
[25:47] I need to make my time valuable so if
[25:50] you thought you were busy now wait till
[25:52] you have a kid um so you're going to
[25:54] have to learn how to get up early um and
[25:57] squeeze in a workout get the dishes done
[26:00] before you go to bed at night like no
[26:02] goofing around on on YouTube um like
[26:05] you're going to have to learn to really
[26:07] make the best use of your time um it's
[26:10] going to challenge you it's going to say
[26:11] hey I need to be a good example to my
[26:14] kid I mean just as a arbitrary example
[26:17] of this too you know kids kids mimic you
[26:20] so whenever I'm in the presence of my
[26:23] daughter I'm trying to think through
[26:24] like what's the best example here so
[26:27] like IS F on my phone something I want
[26:30] to model for my kid or would I rather my
[26:34] daughter catch me reading a book so you
[26:37] start to think through things like that
[26:39] like how can I model good behavior how
[26:41] can I make the best use of my time so
[26:44] there is an initial kind of upfront like
[26:46] challenge that you have to reckon with
[26:48] of kind of adjusting uh to that but uh
[26:51] if you step up to the challenge you know
[26:53] you will find yourself like hey I'm
[26:55] cooking better food for myself because I
[26:57] W to make better food for my kid I'm I'm
[27:00] working out because I want to make sure
[27:03] I'm modeling good behavior I'm going for
[27:04] a walk with the stroller um things like
[27:08] that so um if you kind of take having a
[27:10] kid as like your own personal challenge
[27:12] too of like hey if I can make myself
[27:15] better I'm going to model better
[27:16] behavior for my kid so it doesn't mean
[27:19] that hey you're you're sacrificing
[27:21] things for yourself necessarily there is
[27:22] sacrifice involved but the way I see it
[27:25] is like hey if I can be a better indiv
[27:28] idual I'm going to be a better father
[27:31] too I love that and and I want to maybe
[27:34] get a little bit in this this money part
[27:36] also because I have seen so many studies
[27:40] uh and heard about in on other podcast
[27:42] so many about that where um people who
[27:45] have kids earn more and actually make a
[27:49] net plus uh when you consider everything
[27:52] on average then the counterpart uh the
[27:56] male counterpart who don't have uh kids
[27:59] um which is interesting of like yeah the
[28:01] kids obviously cost you more than it
[28:03] bring like it's not like an investment
[28:05] that I don't know like with 15 years old
[28:07] it gives you like 10 million dollars
[28:09] back or something like that uh but it it
[28:11] it it seemingly does something with with
[28:13] your brain with your responsibility with
[28:15] your discipline with like whatever it
[28:18] makes with you it's super interesting
[28:19] for me to think about yeah I mean when
[28:22] you have a kid you got to step it Up all
[28:25] of a sudden you start learning like hey
[28:27] I need to to make more more money I need
[28:28] to like find ways to create more value
[28:31] for people so that absolutely is
[28:33] something that's happened um you know it
[28:35] kind of happens subconsciously if you
[28:38] will is just you know when I'm working
[28:40] during the day I'm really trying to make
[28:42] the most out of it because I know when
[28:45] it comes to whatever time um I'm on Dad
[28:48] Duty so I gotta be attentive with with
[28:51] my kid I got to get things for the house
[28:53] done um and I'm trying to make the most
[28:55] out of time with with kids time with
[28:58] life time um and then there's there's
[29:01] work time so you got to kind of cut
[29:02] through the noise um so usually dad's
[29:06] find themselves stepping up to the
[29:07] challenge I partnered up with coin
[29:10] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[29:13] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[29:15] created by anyone look at that beauty I

[30:07] regular basis I guess you already bought
[30:09] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[30:12] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[30:15] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[30:18] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[30:20] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple

[31:13] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[31:16] how you can level up your sovereignty
[31:19] that's a good point uh and you also said
[31:21] in the beginning I don't know if you
[31:23] said it before we started recording or
[31:25] after um you you trying to have help
[31:28] dads to be more financially independent
[31:31] with with Bitcoin how do you do that and
[31:33] and and what are you doing there yeah I
[31:35] mean that that's like my whole point on
[31:37] X is I I want to help men I want to help
[31:40] dads become more financially independent
[31:43] free whatever uh via Bitcoin so I think
[31:46] a lot of that is you know especially in
[31:49] 2025 I think there's a lot of new
[31:51] bitcoiners out there and you know my own
[31:53] Bitcoin journey I I made all the
[31:55] mistakes you possibly can make right so
[31:58] um learned about nfts sold Bitcoin at
[32:02] any opportune times and I did it all
[32:05] right so now through learning and making
[32:08] mistakes I know that hey I'm a Bitcoin
[32:11] only person I'm a Bitcoin Maxi um and
[32:14] you need to hold Bitcoin in the long
[32:16] term um and these other things are
[32:19] distractions from what you're trying to
[32:20] do from Building Wealth so really I want
[32:23] to help dads learn about Bitcoin and
[32:26] avoid some of those kind of classic
[32:27] mistakes a lot of people make um because
[32:30] I think people are kind of maybe they
[32:32] discover Bitcoin but they think oh it's
[32:34] it's over $100,000 I'm too late to
[32:37] bitcoin no you're not believe me um it's
[32:40] still a very great price uh for you to
[32:42] get in early there there is no I'm late
[32:45] to bitcoin um so I think people are are
[32:48] tempted to look at U an altcoin and go
[32:51] oh this thing's only you know priced at
[32:53] a doar two I'm going to buy a bunch of
[32:56] these so I can get a better return on my
[32:58] investment and then they get rug pulled
[33:00] or they learn that there's something
[33:02] wrong with it and it goes to zero so no
[33:05] just go into Bitcoin learn about Bitcoin
[33:08] commit the time uh to learning about it
[33:11] I think one of Sailor points is you know
[33:13] spend a 100 hours learning about Bitcoin
[33:16] and you will be fully convinced about
[33:18] its value proposition about the
[33:20] principles of sound money and you'll
[33:22] understand that Bitcoin is our big
[33:24] opportunity to have a the greatest form
[33:27] of how money ever created um and to
[33:30] build wealth for future
[33:32] Generations uh that's that's a it's a
[33:34] good point like it's it seems like
[33:36] there's no educated critique critic out
[33:39] there I mean uh Peter shiff comes now to
[33:41] my mind he he probably knows a lot about
[33:43] Bitcoin but maybe there are other
[33:45] reasons why he's not also still against
[33:47] Bitcoin but like in general there there
[33:49] seems to be no one that is actually
[33:51] educated on bitcoin who also uh is
[33:54] against Bitcoin that's like the person
[33:57] doesn't exist
[33:58] right well I think shiff in in in his
[34:00] particular instance he's his business is
[34:03] highly incentivized to defend the status
[34:06] quo if you will I suspect that Peter
[34:09] Schiff knows a little bit more than he's
[34:12] L on to I have no way of proving that of
[34:15] course but I think that Schiff you know
[34:18] he he does he understands Austrian
[34:21] economics I suspect he really does
[34:23] understand some of the the value of of
[34:25] Bitcoin more than he lets on on um but
[34:29] you maybe he'll reveal that to us uh on
[34:31] his deathbed but I don't think we're
[34:32] going to get to know until that time it
[34:36] would be so uh awesome uh if he at one
[34:39] point just comes out as a Bitcoin Maxi
[34:42] that would be such a point well people
[34:45] joke sometimes is this guy actually
[34:47] Satoshi and he's just pulling like a a
[34:49] massive trolling campaign on us so may
[34:52] maybe that's what's happening we're just
[34:53] none the wiser
[34:55] so if if he a she then heads off to him
[34:59] yeah right it's not impossible but it's
[35:03] it's not the most
[35:05] likely I don't know yeah I'd be that
[35:09] would be hilarious but I hope that's not
[35:11] the instance so yeah it's um there there
[35:16] a great Point like because we have all
[35:18] those theories like who zamoto is like
[35:21] for from Adam back to John Nash to to
[35:24] Nick Sabu to all of those people um who
[35:29] even Steve Jobs are heard and stuff like
[35:31] that like there are crazy theories out
[35:32] there which all if if you look just at
[35:35] that one Theory at that instant you're
[35:37] like yeah it couldn't be it could be but
[35:40] if you think about who sakoto really is
[35:43] like it it's it's unlikely that he gives
[35:47] any um any real information out there so
[35:52] all all of the things that we know might
[35:55] just be to confuse us like people say
[35:57] like for example I had someone on saying
[35:59] oh John Nash is is sat moded and people
[36:02] said in the comments oh like he he wrote
[36:04] with a British accent that it's not
[36:06] possible I'm like if I'm actually
[36:09] British and I want to really confuse
[36:11] people I will not ride with my British
[36:12] accent I ride with something else right
[36:16] you know I mean I ultimately don't think
[36:18] it matters who who it is um I this may
[36:23] sound morbid or or callous but I I hope
[36:27] that Satoshi I'm so grateful for what he
[36:30] did or what she did or what they did but
[36:33] I hope that
[36:34] Satoshi passes away without us ever
[36:37] knowing who this person is um and that
[36:40] it remains this Anonymous gift um to the
[36:44] world that they were able to create um
[36:47] you know in terms of like you know their
[36:49] background and everything it's fun to
[36:51] speculate and everything but um
[36:54] ultimately it doesn't really matter um
[36:56] it's the principles of what Bitcoin is
[36:58] it's it's once in that white paper that
[37:00] is the really valuable thing that we we
[37:03] should all try be learning more one
[37:06] thing just came uh to my mind when when
[37:08] we're talking about that you probably
[37:10] saw it the meme of when Scotty pip said
[37:13] something like oh like I I met satosi
[37:17] nakam something like that and and
[37:19] Michael
[37:21] sa it was so nice right forever a meme
[37:25] so absolutely I just wanted to sprinkle
[37:29] that in it's really interesting um you
[37:32] are also probably big on on family unit
[37:35] I think like that that's one thing uh
[37:38] that maybe is the thing why certain uh
[37:41] groups interest groups don't want dads
[37:44] and and parenting stuff like that
[37:45] because it kind of dis uh kind of
[37:48] discredits the elite and in the family
[37:51] unit is getting smaller and this family
[37:53] unit should get bigger and more
[37:54] important and that's the most important
[37:56] thing is that is that also how I usually
[37:58] like of like the family unit is the most
[38:00] essential thing in in life and if that's
[38:02] intact everything else kind of falls
[38:04] into place well you know that's the
[38:07] that's one of the problems with the Fiat
[38:08] standard is when you have broken money
[38:12] many of the institutions that you once
[38:15] relied upon they they become weaker um
[38:19] they become more frail and more more
[38:21] more fragile if you will um where Fiat
[38:24] money you it creates Division if you
[38:28] will uh where it's separating you from
[38:30] it where it creates these new incentives
[38:33] where you think a lot more shortterm and
[38:36] you know nothing about having a family
[38:37] is is like a short-term decision right
[38:40] um you know people that are engaged in
[38:43] in Fiat habits they're they're quick
[38:45] Spenders um they're looking to kind of
[38:48] make the quick Buck if you will um
[38:50] there's nothing about the Fiat standard
[38:52] that is is good for the family unit or
[38:54] for society so um when you have sound
[38:57] money you're able to have stronger
[38:59] institutions that are able to save and
[39:01] build wealth and kind of create a moat
[39:03] if you will around their business around
[39:05] their family around their Church
[39:07] whatever it might be so um having things
[39:10] on the Bitcoin standard is is able to
[39:12] strengthen institutions like that so I
[39:15] think as people adopt Bitcoin you will
[39:17] see stronger family units I think you'll
[39:19] see stronger businesses too U that arest
[39:22] rail I think someday you'll see you know
[39:25] less Giant dips in the economy like you
[39:29] know OA crashes I don't think if we were
[39:32] living in a more Bitcoin standard world
[39:34] something like that would happen um but
[39:36] of course in the Fiat world that's going
[39:38] to happen every four or five
[39:40] years do do you think this automatically
[39:44] also makes um so a stronger family unit
[39:48] then also makes governments
[39:50] automatically smaller yeah I do I mean I
[39:53] think when you have stronger family
[39:54] units um you're going to have less
[39:56] societal wos
[39:58] um you know stronger family units often
[40:00] results in less crime it results in
[40:03] higher graduation rates um more
[40:06] education um healthier um I mean yeah
[40:10] healthier bodies um and healthier
[40:12] finances too so I think you'll see
[40:14] people relying on those things a lot
[40:16] less
[40:17] too that's something I never looked at
[40:19] it obviously I think Bitcoin itself
[40:21] makes um governments smaller because
[40:24] they have less opportunity to print
[40:26] money uh no matter if if the money print
[40:29] is completely gone or just like highly
[40:32] stricted by by Bitcoin because people
[40:35] have an and flight and an exit wealth uh
[40:37] so Bitcoin definitely no matter if you
[40:39] believe US dollar will always be there
[40:41] or will completely go on go away in both
[40:44] instances Bitcoin will make governments
[40:47] smaller by by the way do you believe
[40:49] that that we we completely get rid of of
[40:51] feat
[40:53] currencies um I don't think that's
[40:55] necessary for Bitcoin to succeed or
[40:57] survive or or Thrive for that matter um
[41:01] it it's turning out that the government
[41:03] needs Bitcoin more than Bitcoin doesn't
[41:06] need the government government needs
[41:08] Bitcoin um and I know like as an example
[41:11] of you know this is more of a crypto but
[41:13] um like stable coins they're becoming
[41:15] one of the largest buyers of of US debt
[41:18] um so I think governments is much as I
[41:21] despise the government I will give them
[41:23] credit for this they are they're like a
[41:25] roach they're good at surviving
[41:27] and while they aren't the best adapters
[41:30] they'll adapt to survive so I think that
[41:33] you will see governments adapting uh
[41:36] adopting Bitcoin in order to survive um
[41:39] in order for people to continue buying
[41:40] their debts you'll you'll somay see
[41:43] Bitcoin backed treasuries um you'll see
[41:46] us reserves you'll see foreign reserves
[41:49] in Bitcoin too um you'll see governments
[41:52] adopting Bitcoin in ways in order for
[41:55] them to continue having Rel relevance in
[41:57] the economy and in the world so if they
[42:00] if they want to survive they're going to
[42:02] have to adopt Bitcoin that the same goes
[42:04] true for for families for businesses for
[42:07] institutions and and for governments
[42:09] across the world what do you make with
[42:12] uh um you're an America right yes uh
[42:16] what do you make of of the the new
[42:18] administration of like embracing Bitcoin
[42:21] but also embracing the the the crypto
[42:24] Mania you're right yeah it is kind of
[42:26] the Administration is seemingly
[42:29] embracing the entire crypto World um so
[42:32] I think it's generally a good thing for
[42:35] Bitcoin um you know one the SEC is
[42:38] essentially I think going to be a
[42:39] non-threat for the next four years uh
[42:43] that being said I think you're going to
[42:44] see some really big wild rides that
[42:47] happen in the crypto World um I don't
[42:49] think like the FDX like block five
[42:53] Celsius um Mount gaau days are behind us
[42:57] I think we're going to start to see a
[42:58] few more of those um happen um in terms
[43:01] of total collapses that happen within
[43:04] different
[43:05] cryptos I know like the Haw Tua coin as
[43:07] an example um you know that rug pull
[43:10] happened recently that's not over um and
[43:13] I think that we're going to see some
[43:14] more of those I think people are just
[43:16] going to have to learn you know how to
[43:18] avoid those themselves um but in terms
[43:21] of kind of what the future looks like
[43:22] for Bitcoin I I'm not worried about
[43:25] these other cryptos taking market share
[43:27] away from Bitcoin like they're going to
[43:29] get eight up eventually so um there's
[43:32] nothing that can could beat with
[43:34] Bitcoin it's it's it's it's hilarious
[43:36] the the whole thing with oh I have a
[43:39] personal brand oh I will make uh some
[43:41] some sort of cryptocoin uh with like the
[43:44] the Trump coin the Melania
[43:46] coin the HW coin I I I do hope that that
[43:52] uh trend is going uh away at at some
[43:55] point uh but yeah in the mean time it's
[43:58] fine if the free market rocks some
[44:00] people it's h i i don't I I think it's
[44:03] not good for Bitcoin overall uh but it's
[44:05] also not bad like it's it's not
[44:08] something that will bring Bitcoin down
[44:10] obviously it gives Bitcoin a bad rep
[44:12] because the general population they are
[44:15] putting Bitcoin uh in the same pocket
[44:19] even though it's completely irrational
[44:22] in the same as trumpcoin as the hog tour
[44:25] girl and all the things well look so I
[44:28] think part of this is just human nature
[44:30] right so if you look at the US dollar
[44:33] there's a lot of schemes happening under
[44:36] the US dollar system too right it's not
[44:38] unique to bitcoin or crypto um so I I
[44:42] think that's just always going to be
[44:43] something that's prevalent where you're
[44:45] going to have there's going to be people
[44:47] that are schemers there's going to be
[44:49] people that think that they're late and
[44:52] they need to find a kind of a how to
[44:53] make a quick Buck how can I get like
[44:55] this new getrich quick scheme like
[44:58] humans we we're just drawn to that and I
[45:01] think that's kind of our you
[45:02] know our nature is to to have some of
[45:06] those Temptations If you will uh whereas
[45:09] if we were to remain focused and kind of
[45:11] have a first principal mindset we would
[45:14] be drawn to bitcoin more but yeah in
[45:17] reality it's just hey if you stick if
[45:18] you make it simple and you you stick
[45:21] with Bitcoin you're going to be fine and
[45:22] you're going to be in a lot better
[45:24] position than if you tried trumpcoin or
[45:27] to a coin or whatever else so and to a
[45:30] certain extent it's also a free market I
[45:32] mean I wouldn't embrace it uh but yeah
[45:35] like if if people want to do that and uh
[45:37] really want to gamble in that and and
[45:39] there's a market for that like uh people
[45:42] should do what they think they should do
[45:44] with the money I don't I certainly don't
[45:46] recommend it and I would not do it but
[45:48] if they they choose to do that that's
[45:50] like free market for you yeah I mean I I
[45:53] really start I see the altcoin stuff as
[45:55] is gambling you know and if you want to
[45:58] gamble that that's fine like if you want
[46:00] to go to Las Vegas and and gamble uh
[46:04] with poker I think you have a better
[46:05] chance of Poker uh but I think uh that's
[46:08] that's fine if you want to do that but
[46:10] it's not it's not Bitcoin it's it's not
[46:13] sound money so um let's just not pretend
[46:16] that it's any kind of form of like
[46:17] serious
[46:18] money yeah that's actually my answer
[46:21] usually uh because like if if I meet
[46:23] someone that is that that doesn't know
[46:25] me and I'm telling oh like I'm into
[46:27] Bitcoin and he's like oh like do you
[46:29] also have other coins and I'm like no I
[46:31] rather go to the casino like that's
[46:33] usually my answer to that one because i'
[46:36] rather I'd rather play Texas hem so yeah
[46:38] I I completely agree there's at least an
[46:41] experience there's at least some some
[46:42] some of human connection also in there
[46:45] there some fun in there I mean maybe
[46:48] people also feel human connection to to
[46:51] Trump if they buy the Trump coin and and
[46:53] and and stuff like that that that that
[46:55] could be that also but I I don't get it
[46:58] um what else do you expect from from
[47:00] this year 2095 like it's the second year
[47:02] of the ETFs there's there's so much
[47:04] happening this this year yeah you know
[47:07] in terms of 2025 two really big hopes um
[47:11] if the US were to implement a strategic
[47:14] Reserve I think that would be a huge
[47:16] groundbreaking moment uh I know some
[47:19] people kind of debate whether we'll
[47:21] announce it or will kind of secretly
[47:23] stack Bitcoin I don't think the US
[47:25] government is going to be able to pull
[47:27] that off secretly so I think it will be
[47:28] more of an announcement so I think
[47:31] you'll see more governments around the
[47:32] world start to adopt Bitcoin uh whether
[47:35] it like takes off right away I I don't
[47:38] know um but I think he'll start to see
[47:40] that as a bigger Trend um one of the
[47:43] other big things that I think is kind of
[47:45] a under underrated if you will is in the
[47:48] US there's a I think it's called sb14
[47:51] that's something like that um the people
[47:54] on the internet on in the comments can
[47:56] correct me but basically uh it's a
[47:58] regulation that prevents Banks from
[48:01] customing uh Bitcoin for customers uh I
[48:05] think if that is repealed and you start
[48:06] to see other financial institutions able
[48:09] to custody Bitcoin for their customers
[48:12] um that will be a really big deal in
[48:14] terms of seeing other Bitcoin adoption
[48:16] happen um I obviously a big believer in
[48:19] self custody that's not something I
[48:21] recommend is having people custody it
[48:23] for you um like having it on an exchange
[48:26] or anything like that
[48:27] um but there are going to be a segment
[48:29] of the population that wants a custody
[48:31] partner that's going to do that for them
[48:34] so um I think those two things happening
[48:37] in
[48:37] 2025 will have a huge impact and I think
[48:40] they're very doable in 2025
[48:43] too yeah and I also think that uh
[48:47] there not everyone will do self- custody
[48:50] not everyone can do self custody on the
[48:53] main layer like technically this will
[48:55] not be possible at some point uh I made
[48:59] that episode with Viet I think he said
[49:01] 50 million uh institutions and
[49:04] individuals uh that roughly can
[49:07] currently uh on on a on a daily basis
[49:11] transact on the base layer um so that
[49:14] that's not
[49:15] everyone maybe we can expand that in the
[49:18] future maybe we have some something that
[49:20] makes like shared utos and stuff like
[49:22] that there's a lot of of technical
[49:23] things we could do but I think in order
[49:27] to preserve the decentralization of
[49:29] Bitcoin we kind of have to scale in
[49:31] layers and if we have to scale in layers
[49:34] which means that uh not everyone will be
[49:38] frankly just not rich enough to be able
[49:41] to um use the the main layer or on at
[49:47] least not on every transaction like
[49:49] maybe you have like a big savings
[49:51] account on the main layer and like once
[49:54] a quarter once every half year you get a
[49:57] little bit out there you put it on a
[49:59] second layer third layer and there you
[50:01] pie your coffees with and stuff like
[50:02] that uh so uh I there's a lot of uh
[50:07] things then like then we can discuss
[50:09] like does self- custody make sense on
[50:12] like a third layer technology is that
[50:14] even self
[50:16] custody like what what is the custody
[50:18] solution out there it's super
[50:20] interesting for me to think about the
[50:21] scaling Solutions of of of Bitcoin how
[50:24] do how do you see that yeah you know to
[50:26] people used to say like oh well can you
[50:28] buy coffee with Bitcoin well now you can
[50:31] there's plenty of apps where you could
[50:33] where you can do that so um that problem
[50:36] has has been solved if you will now is
[50:38] it the financially best move to do that
[50:41] that's more debatable I know some people
[50:43] try to live on a Bitcoin standard and
[50:45] and have zero uh currency like us or
[50:49] otherwise um but yeah I think that
[50:51] you'll see other Solutions it's getting
[50:53] easier to interact with Bitcoin um I
[50:56] mean
[50:57] it wasn't long ago where actually just
[50:58] simply buying Bitcoin was a difficult
[51:02] ordeal um so now there's plenty of
[51:04] places like you can buy Bitcoin I mean
[51:06] even at my grocery store there's a
[51:08] Bitcoin ATM right so there's there's
[51:11] plenty of places for people to buy
[51:12] Bitcoin and now there's more solutions
[51:14] for people to actually use it on the
[51:16] daily there's going to be more solutions
[51:19] for multi signature storage um there's
[51:22] going to be more solutions for Bitcoin
[51:24] Insurance um all these things are
[51:26] developing this thing's only 16 years
[51:28] old right so um you know imagine if
[51:31] people levied the same critiques of the
[51:33] US dollar when it was 16 years old or or
[51:36] gold right um this is an evolving
[51:40] technology um that we are going to have
[51:43] new developments that make this easier
[51:44] to onboard people and to use for Bitcoin
[51:48] back loans for insurance and and other
[51:51] things like that yeah and it's it's kind
[51:54] of crazy how fast it develops I already
[51:56] talked how small the German speaking
[51:58] area is compared to the rest of the
[52:00] world but only here we have four
[52:03] different Bitcoin only exchanges only in
[52:05] Austria we have two different Bitcoin
[52:07] only exchanges like eight million people
[52:09] have like two different Bitcoin only
[52:11] exchanges uh there's like in the Swiss I
[52:14] heard there's at almost every train
[52:16] station you can buy Bitcoin gift cards
[52:19] with cash uh there's Bitcoins everywhere
[52:22] like there are so many possibilities uh
[52:25] and it's crazy for me because I came
[52:28] into Bitcoin in 2020 where uh there was
[52:30] already coinbase around this was my
[52:33] first exchange that I used now I don't
[52:34] use it anymore but before that like 2017
[52:38] 2015 especially like even further down
[52:41] the road it was really hard to get
[52:43] Bitcoin like you had to transfer money
[52:45] somewhere um uh weirdly and you like not
[52:49] sure if you're getting ripped off now
[52:50] and stuff like that so I I heard a lot
[52:52] of those stories
[52:54] unfortunately I didn't uh well
[52:56] fortunately I I didn't experience that
[52:58] but I heard a lot about those those
[53:01] those stories in the ear early days yeah
[53:03] I mean people make a lot of a lot of
[53:05] mistakes on those things so I think
[53:06] hopefully as time goes on people will
[53:08] get to skip a lot of those things um you
[53:11] know I kind of call the uh the Bitcoin
[53:13] Heroes Journey if you will of like
[53:16] people have to go on this kind of this
[53:18] trail of learning about Bitcoin and they
[53:21] they make some dumb mistakes in the
[53:23] beginning U I don't think I've ever
[53:25] heard someone's Bitcoin story
[53:27] yep I I learned about it I I bought as
[53:29] much as I possibly could and I've never
[53:31] sold since um like that is you know not
[53:34] happened right or like I I nailed the
[53:36] timing perfectly e even you know
[53:39] everyone's everyone's favorite right
[53:41] Michael sailor the dude only learned
[53:43] about well he learned about it much
[53:45] earlier but he he start in 2013 he had a
[53:48] tweet where he thought that Bitcoin
[53:50] would be banned um and he first bought
[53:53] Bitcoin in 2020 so even his story is
[53:58] imperfect um so you know it just
[54:01] behooves you to say hey I need to learn
[54:02] about Bitcoin and I need to start my
[54:04] Bitcoin Heroes Journey sooner U so I can
[54:08] avoid some of these mistakes and you
[54:09] know buy it at the price that you
[54:12] deserve absolutely yeah uh really cool
[54:15] um one thing before we come to the end
[54:18] routines of the podcast um what tip do
[54:21] you have for future dads that are not
[54:24] dads right now but I want to be dads in
[54:26] in the future yeah you know I'll I'll uh
[54:29] I'll put it this way so start thinking
[54:32] longer term um start saving in Bitcoin
[54:35] and thinking through not just saving for
[54:38] yourself or your future self but
[54:40] thinking in longer term and in terms of
[54:43] generations um you know stacking SATs
[54:46] for your kids uh and building long-term
[54:48] wealth for them so that's what I would
[54:50] encourage you to
[54:51] do I love that um I have one question to
[54:54] ask each and every one of my guests and
[54:56] the question is what can we learn from
[54:58] you besides
[55:00] Bitcoin okay uh you know besides Bitcoin
[55:03] I would say what you could potentially
[55:05] learn from me is trying to be an active
[55:09] dad being a proactive dad sometimes I
[55:11] think people go through life and it's
[55:13] just kind of happening to them whereas
[55:16] you should really try to say hey how can
[55:18] I be intentional about being a
[55:22] dad you know how can I model good
[55:24] behavior how can I create memories um
[55:28] how can I educate my kids be an
[55:31] intentional dad be an intentional human
[55:33] being too um don't just let life happen
[55:36] to you but actually create life for
[55:38] yourself that's an amazing learning I
[55:40] think that's like once you get like in
[55:43] the in the active part you you're like
[55:46] stepping out of that NPC Meme and you're
[55:48] like kind of the the character in your
[55:50] life and I I love that really cool
[55:53] perfect we have end rtin in the podcast
[55:55] where the previous guests asking a
[55:56] question for the next guest without
[55:58] knowing who the next guest actually is
[56:00] and uh your question from the previous
[56:02] guest is what is your biggest Bitcoin
[56:04] regret I have a few but I think I mean I
[56:08] think my biggest regret was when my
[56:11] first time I 3x my
[56:14] Bitcoin returns I felt irresponsible
[56:18] holding it um I felt like this
[56:20] gut-wrenching feeling of like I if I
[56:23] don't sell this I'm going to be making a
[56:25] huge mistake and I just I sold and I
[56:28] just at the time didn't understand that
[56:32] hey what the long-term value proposition
[56:34] was I hadn't done my 100 hours um I
[56:37] decided to to buy a little bit um just
[56:40] to kind of dabble in it um and I didn't
[56:43] really understand what I was what I was
[56:45] doing so U of course in in that that
[56:48] mindset you know I thought I was doing
[56:51] the right thing of you know okay I want
[56:53] to take my profit and kind of have my
[56:55] day and then of course shoots back up
[56:57] another another 3x but so my biggest
[57:01] regret is is is selling back in the day
[57:04] um and I would be a much wealthier man
[57:06] if I had not done that so um really
[57:10] understand Bitcoin and and and hold on
[57:12] to it as long as you possibly yeah like
[57:14] selling too early or not buying more
[57:19] early enough is always the biggest
[57:22] regret right right yeah that I could
[57:23] have said that too right not buying in
[57:25] 2009
[57:27] so yeah like or not even like when I
[57:30] first it took me a year to really fully
[57:33] grasp like it took me three years to get
[57:35] over the thing that Bitcoin is a scam I
[57:37] heard Bitcoin in 2017 in 2020 first part
[57:41] and then I needed from the first time I
[57:43] bought Bitcoin till I went all in like
[57:46] where I'm like oh like Bitcoin is my
[57:48] standard I needed one year uh so in that
[57:52] one year if I just like made that
[57:54] decision not after one year but after
[57:56] like maybe two months intensive
[57:59] studies I would have probably had like
[58:02] twox or three x the the stack that I
[58:04] have now which is like oh man like that
[58:07] would be amazing right right see no
[58:10] one's no one's story is perfect and
[58:11] that's that's totally fine so you just
[58:13] got to get started and it's you know the
[58:16] expression right stay humble and stack
[58:18] SS and we have to remember that we are
[58:20] all still early even if you start today
[58:23] with your first uh fosis uh by that's
[58:26] that's the most important thing thank
[58:28] you so much uh Bitcoin dad for for being
[58:30] on thank you so much for for taking the
[58:32] time uh before I let you go where can
[58:34] people find you ask you questions and
[58:35] reach out to you yeah you can just find
